6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:19,400
Yeah?

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,360
Can we start dating?

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:20,800
Yes.

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,280
Can I float this with you?

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,400
Happy now?

11
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,560
I had a lot of fun today.

12
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,240
I’ve never gotten to do something like this before.

13
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,200
Thank you.

14
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,080
I’ll get going.

15
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,320
Bye-bye.

DIRECTED BY SIWAJ SAWATMANEEKUL

17
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,360
Damn it.

18
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,040
I must burn the midnight oil again, for sure.

19
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,800
I told you already not to ease up too much.

20
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,040
See?

21
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,440
Hey, are you free this evening?

22
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,760
Let’s go check out the gallery.

23
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,520
Yeah.

24
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,040
Tan mentioned his friends are joining, too.

25
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,040
Hey.

26
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,800
Where were you yesterday?

27
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,440
Do you know Toey dragged me to float a krathong with him?

28
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,760
I had so much fun today.

29
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,480
Peem.

30
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,440
Peem!

31
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,280
What’s wrong with you?

32
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,880
Ugh, what the hell did I do?

33
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,120
Damn it, Peem.

34
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,440
Q, you have been in several relationships before, right?

35
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,800
When you date someone,

36
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,000
you show affection, don’t you?

37
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,000
Like this.

38
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,600
Like a kiss?

39
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,080
Exactly.

40
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:26,560
Uh-huh.

41
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,720
It’s pretty normal for couples to kiss, isn’t it?

42
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,080
But...

43
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,520
what if they aren’t officially together?

44
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,400
Like, they aren’t dating yet?

45
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,240
Yep.

46
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,360
Drunk?

47
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,960
Nope. I wasn’t drunk.

48
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,040
So what actually happened?

49
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:44,800
Who did you kiss?

50
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,680
You didn’t realize what you did or what?

51
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,440
Nope. I didn’t kiss someone randomly.

52
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,720
Your face says it all.

53
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,360
Don’t lie to me.

54
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,760
I mean, this relationship is still complicated.

55
00:04:58,159 --> 00:04:59,640
Make things clear, then.

56
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,400
It’s not that easy, though.

57
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:09,680
Our first encounter with each other was quite… unpleasant.

58
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,000
Answer this question, then.

59
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,960
Do you like him?

60
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:16,800
Huh?

61
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,920
Your face says it all, don’t you know?

62
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,160
Before you talk to him,

63
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,640
figure out your own feelings first.

64
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,200
Ask yourself if you like him or not.

65
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,000
Gotcha. You seem suspicious.

66
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,159
I bet you’ve already fallen for him.

67
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,480
I don’t look suspicious.

68
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,440
Add more colors for me.

69
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,640
I’ll color it.

70
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,720
I’ve got work to do.

71
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,159
Asshole, what’s with you?

72
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,880
Why are you so late?

73
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:56,800
Hurry up.

74
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,240
Why are you in a hurry?

75
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,400
Q won’t disappear on us, you know.

76
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,960
I’m meeting up with Tan, too.

77
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,760
We need to buy a flower bouquet.

78
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,240
Hurry up.

79
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:02,520
Let’s go.

80
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,560
Hey.

81
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,800
We’re congratulating him.

82
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,920
Should we go with roses or daisies?

83
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,720
Hey. Help me choose.

84
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,320
Maybe this isn’t the right shop,

85
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,240
but no worries.

86
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:27,920
I’ll handle it.

87
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,000
Let’s go.

88
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:29,880
Look.

89
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,080
There’re plenty here.

90
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:31,720
Let’s go.

91
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,360
What?

92
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,840
What’s up, guys?

93
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,800
Who are you giving the flower bouquet to?

94
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,560
My friend, of course.

95
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,240
The Fine Arts Faculty is hosting a gallery today,

96
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,360
and Q’s work is on display,

97
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,120
so I’m congratulating him.

98
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,880
The gallery Fang mentioned?

99
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,040
Yep, that’s the one.

100
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,680
Do you want to join us?

101
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:50,640
Absolutely.

102
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,280
Hurry up.

103
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:52,720
Beer, come with us.

104
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,360
Bring your drink too.

105
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,680
Mick, get your stuff quickly.

106
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,720
Quit gaming.

107
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,600
Bring your drink too.

108
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,680
Why are you in such a hurry?

109
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,680
Hurry up.

110
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,640
Strange.

111
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,640
He’s super fast.

112
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,480
I’ve seen your work since it’s still a sketch version,

113
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,480
but it looks stunning displayed here now.

114
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:15,720
Are you bummed your work isn’t up this year?

115
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,320
Not really,

116
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,240
but it’s a regret.

117
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:19,960
Forget about it.

118
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,440
It’s alright.

119
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,400
I’ll submit it again next year.

120
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,520
We can do that every year.

121
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:30,200
Next year, your work must be displayed next to mine.

122
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,480
Why?

123
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,840
You want to compare whose work is better, huh?

124
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,800
Mine is absolutely more beautiful.

125
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,880
What? 	What’s with you?

126
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,760
Q, can I take a photo with you, please?

127
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,480
I really like your art.

128
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,760
Shit.

129
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,840
You’ve got fans already.

130
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44,560
Sure.

131
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:45,880
Take your time.

132
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,560
I’ll be right back.

133
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:47,920
See you.

134
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,640
See you.

135
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,560
Where’s your friend?

136
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,200
Over there.

137
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,960
You guys go ahead.

138
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,640
I’ll catch up.

139
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,920
Are you avoiding me?

140
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:31,880
No.

141
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,720
I just had a sneeze coming on.

142
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,360
Why did you make that face when you saw me?

143
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,559
I just squeezed my nose,

144
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,400
so I wouldn’t sneeze into your face.

145
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,280
What’s with you?

146
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,400
What are you doing here?

147
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,040
Someone like you is here to watch art?

148
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,000
Over there.

149
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,240
I came with Tan.

150
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,360
What do you think about these artworks?

151
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,040
They’re impressive.

152
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,320
If you hadn’t kicked my work,

153
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,320
it would have been displayed here.

154
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,200
About what happened…

155
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,200
Tan is over there, right?

156
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,480
I’ll go see him.

157
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:30,720
Hey.

158
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,160
Congratulations, buddy.

159
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,280
Why the overreaction?

160
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,600
Nope.

161
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,760
Buddy, your work is displayed in the gallery,

162
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,760
so I must congratulate you, of course.

163
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,240
This is your work?

164
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,000
If it’s not mine, whose could it be?

165
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,680
Beautiful work.

166
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,840
Thanks a lot.

167
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,240
I know I’m good at this.

168
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,120
We aren't late, right?

169
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,520
Well, I spent ages arguing with Pun over flower choices.

170
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,000
Hey, congrats.

171
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,240
What’s this?

172
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,240
Lotus.

173
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,440
I was planning to buy another kind of flower for you,

174
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,520
but Pun wanted to stick to Thainess.

175
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,520
I bet he’s still into Loy Krathong.

176
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,360
That sounds like you, Pun.

177
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,800
Hey, my comrade Mick.

178
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,040
My comrade Pun.

179
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,040
Have you been doing great?

180
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:21,640
Yeah.

181
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,560
He’s been standing here for ages,

182
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,320
but you just noticed him?

183
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,080
Where is Peem, by the way?

184
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,600
There he is.

185
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,880
What’s up, Peem?

186
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,480
Perfect timing.

187
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,040
We’re all here.

188
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,200
Let’s take a selfie.

189
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,560
Here we go.

190
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,640
Move closer.

191
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,640
Hurry up.

192
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,440
One, two, three.

193
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,320
I’m doing it nonstop.

194
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,400
Nonstop.

195
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,920
Won't your phone memory fill up?

196
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,840
Anyway, congratulations once again, buddy.

197
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,000
As for you, Peem,

198
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,720
though your work isn’t up this year,

199
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,080
if it is displayed next year,

200
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,720
expect even more hype from me.

201
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,360
Fang, do you like that one?

202
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,480
It’s beautiful.

203
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,320
Hey.

204
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,200
Thanks a lot for coming.

205
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,280
No problem.

206
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,800
Congratulations once again.

207
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,240
Let’s celebrate later.

208
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,680
Get home safe.

209
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,640
I’ll head inside.

210
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,760
Bye.

211
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,000
Let’s go.

212
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:28,960
See you.

213
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,200
Aren’t you leaving with your buddies?

214
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,920
I don’t want to go home yet.

215
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,360
So?

216
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,320
I haven't had a proper look around the gallery.

217
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,160
Can you show me around?

218
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,920
Why is he acting like nothing happened?

219
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,160
Can we go back now?

220
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,360
We’ve seen everything.

221
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:44,080
[Your work is really amazing.]
[I’m giving you a thumbs up.]

222
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,440
Q.

223
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,360
Q!

224
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:01,920
Eh?

225
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:03,920
Toey.

226
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,120
Has your work become more beautiful?

227
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,600
It’s the same one you already saw.

228
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,640
Can we get a photo with it?

229
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,480
Sure.

230
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,840
What is your plan after this?

231
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,640
Nothing.

232
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:30,680
Why?

233
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,680
I’ll treat you to some desserts.

234
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:33,920
Huh?

235
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,600
Are you sick, Q?

236
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,640
Are you alright?

237
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,120
You said I didn’t take care of you at all,

238
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,600
so, I’m treating you to some desserts.

239
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,160
That’s right, but…

240
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,040
Or you aren’t coming?

241
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,560
I’m going with you, of course.

242
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,320
I love free stuff.

243
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:05,680
Let’s go.

244
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,240
Now?

245
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,160
Yep.

246
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,840
Q, wait for me.

247
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,400
What’s wrong?

248
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:26,960
Follow me.

249
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:28,960
Yeah.

250
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,640
Here you are.

251
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,560
Thank you.

252
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,120
Hello.

253
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,640
Hey, Q.

254
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,200
Toey?

255
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,280
How come you two came together?

256
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,480
I see.

257
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,480
You two are going to the same university.

258
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,120
You know Toey?

259
00:15:58,920 --> 00:15:59,800
Of course.

260
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,320
You’re thinking you’re the only Fine Arts student who knows my cafe?

261
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,680
Toey is also my VIP customer.

262
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,200
He’s a regular here.

263
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:08,920
Right?

264
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,400
I’ll have Milk Frappe as usual, please.

265
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,360
Okay.

266
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:16,880
How about you?

267
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,440
What do you want? It’s on me.

268
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,360
The same one, please.

269
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,800
How easy-going.

270
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,080
I’m just afraid

271
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,560
you won’t have enough money to pay.

272
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,680
You’re getting on my nerves.

273
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,600
Why?

274
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,120
So?

275
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,520
2 Milk Frappes, please.

276
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,240
Whoa.

277
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,480
Someone like you pays for others, huh?

278
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,680
Come on.

279
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,840
You’re exaggerating.

280
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,040
I’m treating my mentee to some desserts before this semester finishes.

281
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,040
He’s always complained that I never treated him to anything.

282
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,640
Cool.

283
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,400
What a small world.

284
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,920
Take your seat.

285
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,760
I’ll bring them over.

286
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,079
Got it.

287
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,200
You seem distracted.

288
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,040
You’re a regular customer here,

289
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,640
but why haven’t we met before?

290
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,720
Well,

291
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:48,080
we probably came on different days and times.

292
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:49,760
Why?

293
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,480
You can’t figure out something this easy?

294
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,040
Well,

295
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,200
why did you bring me to Oh’s cafe?

296
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
It’s cheap.

297
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,000
If I’m broke, then I can pay later.

298
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,560
Do you see those paintings?

299
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,920
Those are your mentor’s works.

300
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,080
I painted them since I was young.

301
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,880
I’m a real maestro.

302
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,600
You’re bragging.

303
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,120
What about you?

304
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,200
Why do you come here often?

305
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,920
You’re a regular customer here?

306
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,080
This is where I got to know one person.

307
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,760
That’s why I come here often.

308
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,800
What are you looking at?

309
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,800
Drink before it melts.

310
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,680
Yummy stuff.

311
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,920
I know.

312
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,040
I always order this one.

313
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,600
It’s you who were zoning out.

314
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,760
You're getting better at bantering, huh?

315
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,440
Why?

316
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,200
Hey, hold on.

317
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,800
I want to paint this one.

318
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,480
But it’s already so late now.

319
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,120
Come on.

320
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:50,840
Please.

321
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,480
Fine.

322
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:56,600
Fai.

323
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,640
Hey, Peem.

324
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,600
Still open?

325
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,680
Yeah.

326
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,760
Give me one for my friend.

327
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,280
Your friend?

328
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,480
Fai.

329
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,320
Take a seat.

330
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,960
I’ll get more materials for you.

331
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,240
That table is available.

332
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,040
What are you curious about?

333
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:23,640
Nothing.

334
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,600
What’s wrong?

335
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,600
Nothing.

336
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,720
Well, you paint it.

337
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,640
I’m heading back.

338
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,640
Do it with me.

339
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,040
We’re here together now.

340
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:37,880
Please.

341
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,520
Fine.

342
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,200
Alright.

343
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,680
How annoying.

344
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,520
Good boy.

345
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,000
I’m not your dog.

346
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,720
Adorable.

347
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,440
Here are white and black colors.

348
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,040
Enjoy.

349
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,080
Thank you.

350
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,920
Let’s paint together.

351
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,040
Why are you smiling?

352
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,960
After I finish painting it,

353
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,560
can I bring it home right away?

354
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,080
Not yet.

355
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,240
It needs coating and firing.

356
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,720
Wait for one week

357
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,240
and then tell Fai if you’re picking it up

358
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,320
or want it delivered.

359
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,480
Well, then,

360
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,000
can you keep it for me?

361
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:04,840
For what?

362
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,040
It’s your stuff.

363
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,280
Whether it’s mine or yours, it’s the same anyway.

364
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,040
Phum.

365
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:20,680
Huh?

366
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,920
About what happened…

367
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:26,960
What?

368
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,040
Forget about it.

369
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:33,840
Fai.

370
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:34,800
You’re done?

371
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,000
Okay.

372
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,400
After it gets fired,

373
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,520
I’ll ask Peem to keep it for you.

374
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,240
I’m leaving.

375
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:44,920
Happy now?

376
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,760
Let’s go home.

377
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,120
Huh?

378
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Go home.

379
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,000
I’ll give you a ride.

380
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,440
Let’s go.

381
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,200
Hold on.

382
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,440
What are your semester break plans?

383
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,640
I haven’t thought about it.

384
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,360
Why?

385
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,960
So, you’re free, right?

386
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,920
Don’t beat around the bush.

387
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,800
You want me to work for you again, right?

388
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,840
You enjoy doing whatever pleases you, huh?

389
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,480
I’m not the only one doing that, I guess.

390
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,800
That night, you also…

391
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,240
Hey.

392
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,760
I’ve got work to do.

393
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:36,680
I’ll get going.

394
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,280
See you.

395
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,560
Hey?

396
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,440
Why the rush?

397
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:43,880
I’ve got work to do.

398
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,680
Which one?

399
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,920
You’ve finished it already, haven’t you?

400
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,640
Why are you in a hurry?

401
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,840
- I’m going inside.
- 	We’re not done talking.

402
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,640
I’m going inside.

403
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,360
I must have gone nuts.

404
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,280
Phum.

405
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,440
You buffalo.

406
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,440
Buffalo.

407
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,280
Buffalo!

408
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,200
Got it?

409
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,040
Buffalo!

410
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:09,520
Buffalo!

411
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:09,960
Buffalo!

412
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,600
Buffalo!

413
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,920
I bet he has been studying too hard.

414
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,080
Peem, are you alright?

415
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,600
Phum.

416
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,480
Buffalo!

417
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,160
Got it?

418
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:18,800
Buffalo!

419
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,720
Phum.

420
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,720
Buffalo!

421
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,680
I hope you all make the most of your semester break.

422
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,640
See you next semester.

423
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,120
Thank you.

424
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:34,800
Thank you

425
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,040
Finally, it’s semester break.

426
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,360
It’s semester break!

427
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,440
I’ll head home and sleep.

428
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,640
Why would you sleep?

429
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,720
We must celebrate.

430
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,080
Again.

431
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,320
We’re always celebrating, huh?

432
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,440
Or won’t you drink?

433
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,080
I’ll drink.

434
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:49,840
How about partying at my place?

435
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:50,760
Let’s do that.

436
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,080
Nice.

437
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,840
Invite Toey and Matt, too.

438
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,560
Why should we invite them?

439
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,640
They’d just be a bother.

440
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,520
Come on.

441
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:58,880
Hello?

442
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,560
Toey.

443
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,120
See you at Peem’s place tonight.

444
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,080
Got it?

445
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,720
Okay. See you.

446
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,320
Bye.

447
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,760
Who said “Why should we invite them?”

448
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,840
“They’d just be a bother.”?

449
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,680
Let’s go now.

450
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,280
I’m leaving too.

451
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,480
You aren’t waiting for me.

452
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,560
Who actually isn’t waiting, huh?

453
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,120
Wait for me.

454
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:14,920
Hurry up.

455
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,320
I can’t wait to head home and sleep.

456
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,760
Cheers!

457
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,040
Cheers!

458
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,880
Guys, let’s play a game, okay?

459
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,840
King’s Cup game.

460
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,120
You guys know the rules, right?

461
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,360
Let’s play now.

462
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,000
We play it often.

463
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,840
Take one each.

464
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,320
I’ll take this one.

465
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,640
Slowly.

466
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,520
Yas! King card!

467
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,680
The person I choose must drink it up.

468
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:55,200
That number is

469
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,360
3.

470
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,280
I’ll get a plate, bro.

471
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,280
Hey. Come back.

472
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,080
What’s your number?

473
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,280
3.

474
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:03,960
Nice. It’s you.

475
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,560
Drink it up, Matt.

476
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,440
Bottoms up.

477
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,320
Bottoms up.

478
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,120
Bottoms up.

479
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:08,880
Bottoms up.

480
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,600
Bottoms up.

481
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,320
Bottoms up.

482
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,760
Bottoms up.

483
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,840
Hey? Why are we just sitting?

484
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,520
Let’s keep going.

485
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,080
I’m hyped up now.

486
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,600
Chain, distribute the cards.

487
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,120
I’m King.

488
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,800
But I’m not going to be kind like you, Tan.

489
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,280
My order is…

490
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,480
Which number?

491
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,120
Which number?

492
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:36,800
Which number?

493
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,640
Number 1, you must kiss number 2 on the forehead.

494
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,680
Shit.

495
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,600
Who’s number 2?

496
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:44,720
Who?

497
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:45,960
You?

498
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,440
Hey.

499
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,200
Number 2.

500
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,400
It’s just a forehead kiss.

501
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,200
Just do it.

502
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,520
Quickly.

503
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,000
Alright.

504
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,720
Kiss.

505
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,640
Kiss.

506
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,520
Kiss.

507
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,360
Kiss.

508
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,240
Kiss.

509
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,240
Let’s continue.

510
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,000
I’ll get the King card next time.

511
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,400
Feel like taking revenge, huh?

512
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,200
How vindictive.

513
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,720
Stop overacting.

514
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,520
Hurry up.

515
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,920
I’m King!

516
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:39,960
Are you cheating?

517
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:40,760
What? Cheating?

518
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,400
I’m not.

519
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,960
You saw we all took one card each at the same time.

520
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,280
It’s time to take revenge.

521
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,800
It’s me, I know it.

522
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,400
Number 2 and number 6,

523
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,000
kiss each other on the cheek.

524
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,200
I almost didn’t make it.

525
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,000
Mine is number 6.

526
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,880
Now, let’s find out who number 2 is.

527
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,480
Who?

528
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,240
Who’s number 2?

529
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,120
Number 2, show yourself.

530
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,120
Here we go.

531
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,760
Here we go.

532
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,640
You’re number 2.

533
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,840
Why me?

534
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,720
You think I want to kiss you on the cheek, huh?

535
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,040
Pun, please.

536
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,840
Can you change this to something else?
Please.

537
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,960
You want me to change?

538
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,480
Please.

539
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,560
You’re bargaining, right?

540
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,280
Well, then,

541
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,800
cheek kiss each other 3 times.

542
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,920
Hey.

543
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,440
Do it quickly.

544
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,520
If you keep bargaining,

545
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,760
it will be changed to 6 times.

546
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,680
Wow.

547
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,520
Do it 3 times.

548
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,400
Hurry up.

549
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,640
If you ask for another change, he will change to 10 times.

550
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,360
Q, face me.

551
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,840
Q, your turn.

552
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,560
Hey, continue.

553
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,480
3 times each.

554
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:07,920
Come on.

555
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,520
I’ll be the King in the next round.

556
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,920
You didn’t finish.

557
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,480
What the hell?

558
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,400
We did it 3 times.

559
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,520
Let’s change the game.

560
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,120
Yeah.

561
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,760
How about this game?

562
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,640
We won’t play it anymore.

563
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,560
We’re already bored.

564
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,600
We’ve played 3 rounds already.

565
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,040
Peem.

566
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,000
Do you have another blanket?

567
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:40,840
I feel cold.

568
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,440
Got it.

569
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,840
^&*$(#*%

570
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,600
Pun, shut up.

571
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,800
I want to sleep.

572
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,160
What’s wrong with you, Matt?

573
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,880
Share the blanket with me.

574
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,400
Peem.

575
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,400
Anything for us to eat here?

576
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,640
I’m starving.

577
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,400
We must order food delivery.

578
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:45,800
Let’s do that.

579
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,280
I’ll order now.

580
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,200
Go ahead.

581
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,120
Where is Q?

582
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,120
He’s still in bed.

583
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,320
He didn’t drink that much last night

584
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,000
but was sleeping as if he was dying.

585
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,640
You should be used to that already.

586
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,120
He has always been sleeping like that.

587
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:56,920
Just let him be.

588
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,080
Take it.

589
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,240
Do you want one?

590
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,880
How did you feel?

591
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,680
From now on, whenever you drink,

592
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:07,040
it can never get your heart racing like last night's game did.

593
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,640
What game?

594
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,760
Pun’s game.

595
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,440
Why?

596
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,840
Toey likes Q.

597
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,520
Huh?!

598
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,240
Matt!

599
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,400
Are you serious?

600
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,440
Yes.

601
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,040
Why did you say it?

602
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:27,800
Anything to eat?

603
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,240
What to eat?

604
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,160
What’s with you?

605
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,000
I’m not a ghost.

606
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:32,960
Matt has just said that…

607
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,160
Nothing.

608
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:36,960
Nothing.

609
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,800
You’re hungry, right?

610
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,920
Take this bread.

611
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:39,640
Nope.

612
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:41,480
Let’s go.

613
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,320
Take a shower.

614
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,840
You smell awful.

615
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,440
So?

616
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,720
What Matt said is true.

617
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:05,920
You like Q?

618
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,280
I’m sorry.

619
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,400
It just slipped out.

620
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:16,240
Toey, how did you fall for him?

621
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,200
I always see you guys arguing.

622
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,360
It’s fine if you don’t want to talk about it.

623
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,480
It’s your right.

624
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,920
It’s okay, Chain.

625
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,720
Everyone already knows it.

626
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,400
I don’t want to hide it anymore.

627
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,960
I knew Q from before.

628
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,040
In grade 11,

629
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,000
I often hit the books at a cafe in front of my school.

630
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,680
I was a regular customer there.

631
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,280
Everytime I went to Oh’s cafe,

632
00:32:56,680 --> 00:33:00,160
I met a boy, who was probably around the same age as me.

633
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,480
He walked into the cafe, holding his art supplies.

634
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,640
Everytime I looked at him,

635
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,240
I felt happy and envious at the same time,

636
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:13,200
seeing someone who had realized his passion,

637
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,720
because, at that time,

638
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,320
I still couldn’t figure out what I liked or wanted to do.

639
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:27,720
But one day, this whole story started.

640
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,480
Please pass me a tissue paper.

641
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,400
Don’t worry, Toey.

642
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,200
I’ll clean it up.

643
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,520
We’re sorry.

644
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,800
Let me help, Oh.

645
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:36,000
It spilled under the chair too.

646
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,640
I found it over there.

647
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,760
No idea whom it belongs to.

648
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,800
How did it end up there?

649
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,040
Its owner has been searching the world over for it.

650
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,160
It belongs to my junior,

651
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,520
the one who painted those pictures we talked about.

652
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,080
I see.

653
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:09,040
Please give it to him.

654
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,199
Don’t forget to reward me for finding his stuff.

655
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,880
Reward?

656
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,639
Thanks a lot, by the way.

657
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,920
He must have been looking all over for it.

658
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,560
Hey.

659
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,239
Oh.

660
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,880
Someone asked me to give it to you,

661
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,800
as a thank you for finding their stuff.

662
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:29,920
Whoa.

663
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:32,080
It’s so adorable.

664
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,280
The owner of that pencil case asked me to give it to you.

665
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,880
He asked me to say “thank you” to you.

666
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,280
In this tone of voice?

667
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,960
Is he coming today?

668
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:43,840
I want to see him.

669
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,199
Of course.

670
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,719
He comes every day.

671
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,960
But it’s weird you two haven’t met.

672
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,040
Oh, really?

673
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,239
I want to thank him.

674
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,639
Can you say thank you to him for me?

675
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,360
If you want to thank him, do it yourself.

676
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,080
I’m not a postman.

677
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,600
Well, then,

678
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,600
I’ll write a note on this sticky note

679
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:09,520
and stick it behind this painting.

680
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,960
Please let him know.

681
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,720
Don’t read it.

682
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,040
I can’t read it?

683
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:17,720
20 THB.

684
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:18,600
Sure.

685
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,520
I’ll get back to work.

686
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:22,840
Thank you.

687
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,080
[The painting is really funny.]

688
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,000
[Thank you.]

689
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,640
[Milk Frappe Boy]

690
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,240
[How could you say it’s funny?]

691
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,680
[You should make your work as good as mine first.]

692
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,760
Since then,

693
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:54,840
Pencil Senior and Milk Frappe Boy started communicating through sticky notes.

694
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,640
[Nope. I’m afraid mine will be better than yours, hehe.]

695
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,640
After school,

696
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,640
I’d rush to the cafe to check his messages.

697
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,800
[You’re drawing too?]
[But you can’t be as talented as me.]
[I drew all the paintings in this cafe, just so you know!!!]

698
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:07,920
We gradually got to know each other better through those notes.

699
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:11,120
At first, it was just exciting and fun,

700
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:11,640
[What faculty do you want to study in?]

701
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,880
but as time passed,

702
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,480
it became a habit.

703
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,160
I wanted to talk to him every day.
[Someone like me must study Fine Arts, of course.]
[Ps. Have you discussed not wanting to study medicine with them?]

704
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,760
I talked to Pencil Senior everyday.

705
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,920
Days turned into months,

706
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,880
and then a year.

707
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,880
We never met in person even once.

708
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,800
Meanwhile, I met that boy I mentioned earlier,

709
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,560
so I was curious to know who could draw better,

710
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,080
that boy or Pencil Senior.

711
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,440
[No matter what you do, I’m always rooting for you.]
[Pencil Senior]

712
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,840
But I didn’t realize

713
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:49,960
it’d be the last note I got from Pencil Senior.

714
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,560
I didn’t know where he disappeared to

715
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,880
and couldn’t figure out the reason he stopped talking to me.

716
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,640
[You’ve graduated from high school!]
[Congratulations, Pencil Senior.]
[You did a really great job.]

717
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,880
He disappeared,

718
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:06,280
along with the boy I used to see at the cafe.

719
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,240
Eh? What is Q doing there?

720
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,640
You know him?

721
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:19,680
Of course.

722
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,200
He’s Oh’s favorite junior.

723
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,200
You're here all the time, but you've never met him?

724
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,280
All the paintings behind you are his.

725
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:34,520
That's when I realized the boy from the cafe and Pencil Senior

726
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:38,720
whom I talked with through notes everyday were the same person.

727
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,440
Grow up quickly.

728
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,440
Because of Q, I wanted to try searching for my own passion.

729
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:50,840
He’s my inspiration to get into drawing

730
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,400
and studying art.

731
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,160
Though I’m not gifted in art,

732
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,160
I practiced so hard

733
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,960
that I finally made it to the university

734
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,040
and became Q’s mentee.

735
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,200
Oho. That sounded dope.

736
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,360
You have had a crush on him all this time?

737
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:11,920
Good job, Toey,

738
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:12,840
for having got through it.

739
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,920
How could you manage it?

740
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:14,520
If I were you,

741
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,280
and dealing with all that.

742
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,560
Totally.

743
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,440
You’re right, bro.

744
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,880
I already told Toey to just talk to Q directly

745
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,040
and ask why he disappeared.

746
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,200
Shut up.

747
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,440
By the way, Toey,

748
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:32,120
you call us Hia when we're together,

749
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,600
but you call Q Phi.

750
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,240
Am I right?

751
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,560
That’s true.

752
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,200
Well,

753
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,760
Q is my special someone,

754
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,720
so I want to treat him differently,

755
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,720
even in small ways.

756
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,080
I must do something about it.

757
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,680
I'll make sure you two end up together.

758
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:57,800
No.

759
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,600
What?

760
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,600
I’m already happy with how things are now.

761
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,120
I don’t want to do anything about it.

762
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:08,560
Also, I don’t know how he feels about me.

763
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,320
If you never try, you’ll never know.

764
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,680
Plus, I sense something between you two when you're together.

765
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,720
Don’t overthink it.

766
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,880
Q never speaks his mind,

767
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,360
so he won't admit his feelings.

768
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,680
We must make him slip out.

769
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:27,880
I have a plan.

770
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,480
What are you guys talking about?

771
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:36,880
Shit.

772
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,720
Peem, we forgot to turn off the stove.

773
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,280
You’re right.

774
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,080
What should I be doing?

775
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,760
Oh. The tree.

776
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,920
I’ll water it.

777
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,360
You told me you’d sleep like a top during semester break, didn’t you?

778
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,360
Why would you want me to draw with you here?

779
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,680
I get bored just sleeping in my room.

780
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,640
I should go out and practice drawing

781
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:02,760
to maintain my skill, you know.

782
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,320
I’ll wait over there.

783
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,360
Hello?

784
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,480
(Where are you?)

785
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,160
I’m out drawing with my friend.

786
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,160
(Send me the location. I’ll be there soon.)

787
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,440
You don’t have to come.

788
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,680
(Just send me the location. I’m hanging up.)

789
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,280
Peem.

790
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:41,760
Hey.

791
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,600
You asked him to join?

792
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:46,480
Yeah.

793
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,480
He's been wanting to draw here,

794
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,280
so I invited him.

795
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,520
But why is Chain here too?

796
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,440
You didn’t know?

797
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:55,920
About what?

798
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:59,760
Chain and Toey are in talking stage,

799
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,680
so he’s dropping him off.

800
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,240
Huh?

801
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:02,480
Yeah.

802
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,800
Chain and Toey?

803
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:04,560
Exactly.

804
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,520
When I first heard about it, I was surprised, too.

805
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,640
But after thinking it over,

806
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,880
I think they’re adorable together.

807
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,600
How did I not know about this?

808
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,600
You never pay attention to him.

809
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,040
Who says I don’t?

810
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,040
You said Q never speaks his mind, right?

811
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,200
We need to provoke him somehow

812
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,240
to make him reveal his feelings.

813
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,960
Excuse me, dude.

814
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,520
That sounds like a monster is going to transform itself or something.

815
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,640
So what’s your plan?

816
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,040
We need to find someone to flirt with Toey.

817
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,520
Huh?

818
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,800
Flirt with Toey?

819
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,400
You think that will work?

820
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:39,920
It might.

821
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,600
Think about it.

822
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,280
If Q really has feelings for Toey,

823
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,120
seeing someone flirt with Toey,

824
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:49,480
he must feel anxious,

825
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,840
show some reactions,

826
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,320
or express something through his actions.

827
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,440
Whoa. You’re right.

828
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,400
But who is going to flirt with Toey then?

829
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,520
Don’t worry.

830
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,800
I’ve already figured it out.

831
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:02,280
You.

832
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:03,920
Me?

833
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,560
No way.

834
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,480
Come on.

835
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,040
Well, I mean,

836
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,640
he’s my mentee.

837
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,200
You guys are drawing here?

838
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,480
Toey and I will take photos over there, then.

839
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,120
Sure.

840
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:25,760
See you later.

841
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,080
Where are you going?

842
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,400
Find somewhere to draw.

843
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,160
Eh?

844
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:53,680
[Q seems to be reacting. Our plan might be working.]

845
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,520
Your painting looks beautiful.

846
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:10,560
Eh?

847
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:11,640
What are you doing here?

848
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:12,840
I told you not to come.

849
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,400
I’m free.

850
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:15,600
I have nothing to do.

851
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:19,720
Who’s here with you?

852
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:24,280
Q, Toey, and Chain.

853
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:29,760
By the way,

854
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,400
how long have you been into drawing?

855
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,760
Since I was a kid.

856
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:35,480
Why?

857
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,280
Nothing.

858
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,440
You’re pretty good at it,

859
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,320
so I wonder how long you have been practicing.

860
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,320
I’ve been practicing continuously.

861
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:54,440
Have you finished re-painting that piece?

862
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,840
I noticed you’ve been spending a lot of time on that painting.

863
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:17,480
Is it that meaningful to you?

864
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,720
Not really.

865
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:21,480
Seriously?

866
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:24,360
You have spent this much time and effort on it.

867
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,680
Have you finished it?

868
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:29,840
Yes.

869
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:36,920
Well,

870
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:39,720
I haven’t.

871
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:45,080
So, it looks like

872
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:50,280
you’ll be seeing me around for a while longer.

873
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,480
I’ll wrap it up soon.

874
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:15,440
Before you talk to him,

875
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:18,200
figure out your own feelings first.

876
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,640
Ask yourself if you like him or not.

877
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:31,000
(Have I actually developed feelings for you?)

878
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,600
Remember what you were going to tell me

879
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,200
while painting?

880
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:48,560
Phum

881
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,960
About what happened…

882
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:52,480
What?

883
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:55,320
Just forget about it.

884
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,680
I’ll never forget your kiss,

885
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:51,880
so you mustn’t forget mine either.

886
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:10,360
I've already planned out the next step.

887
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:11,880
What made you ask me to come to the amusement park?

888
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,960
If you want to come, I can bring you here.

889
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:16,840
I’m so scared.

890
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:17,880
I think it suits you well.

891
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,520
Do you think something is going on between them?

892
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:21,920
I bet soon enough,

893
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:24,120
Q will open up about his feelings.

894
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:24,640
Come with me.

895
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:25,840
What are you doing, Q?

896
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,280
How do you feel about Chain?

897
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,000
Did you notice he's been hitting on you?

898
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:31,680
Why are you suddenly asking me this?

899
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:33,040
What if I hit on you too?

900
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:33,600
Huh?
