5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,840
Do you know how hard it was

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,760
to keep this whole thing a secret?

7
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,480
Why didn’t you tell me at all?

8
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,240
I was afraid you’d disappear again.

9
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,600
I won’t disappear anymore.

10
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:28,680
I have something to say.

11
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:30,920
One more drink for me.

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,600
Come on.

13
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,160
Guys,

14
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,440
I also have something to say.

15
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:36,880
What is it?

16
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:37,800
Peem.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,520
What?

18
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,280
Just say what you want to say.

19
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,000
I like you.

20
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:46,960
Huh?

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,520
Huh?

22
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:49,920
Huh?!

23
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,000
Huh?!

24
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,920
Are you serious or joking?

25
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,200
I mean it.

26
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,080
I really like you.

27
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,920
Since you like me,

28
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,160
then…

29
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:47,560
try to win my heart.

30
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,080
Well,

31
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,320
be ready for it then.

32
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,520
He isn’t giving in.

33
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:09,919
Whoa.

34
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,560
Both of my friends are the real deal.

35
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,040
You know what we should do now?

36
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,960
Cheers.

37
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,960
DIRECTED BY SIWAJ SAWATMANEEKUL

38
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,480
I want to do something extra for our gallery this year.

39
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,960
Let’s add something more

40
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,640
besides displaying our work, shall we?

41
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,680
How about music?

42
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,000
Q, you played music with your friends at school, didn’t you?

43
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:13,920
Alright.

44
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,200
I’ll ask them to join.

45
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:15,720
Fabby.

46
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,079
How about merchandise booths too?

47
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,519
So we can earn money for our faculty.

48
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:23,680
Let other faculties sell their stuff too,

49
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,480
so we can attract more people.

50
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,080
What do you think?

51
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:26,720
Good idea.

52
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,880
I want to run a booth.

53
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,840
But do you think we can handle everything in time?

54
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,880
This year’s gallery is happening earlier than last year.

55
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,840
Hey.

56
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,320
Have we ever failed to meet deadlines, huh?

57
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,280
Good point.

58
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,120
I want to open a portrait drawing booth.

59
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,640
Q, join me.

60
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,600
So, I have to sing, play music,

61
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,000
and also draw?

62
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,640
Of course.

63
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,800
Playing music won’t take long, you know.

64
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,040
Then, spend the rest of your time at the booth with me.

65
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,840
This year’s gallery is running a contest as usual.

66
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,680
If you’re interested,

67
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,960
don’t forget to submit your work.

68
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,520
Register here for the duty you want to do on the event day.

69
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,920
But this year,

70
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,960
I’m waiting for your work to be displayed next to mine.

71
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:06,760
Whoa.

72
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,640
You said that

73
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,880
because you’re already confident your work will be displayed?

74
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,680
Certainly.

75
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,600
Wait and see.

76
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,160
I won’t miss it this year.

77
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:21,840
What should we eat?

78
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,880
I think we aren’t eating together.

79
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,760
What’s up?

80
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,440
I bought lunch for you.

81
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,840
Why did you buy it?

82
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,280
You told me to hit on you, didn’t you?

83
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,560
This is how I do it.

84
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,560
Enjoy your meal

85
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,560
and don’t forget to think of me.

86
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,360
I’m off to class.

87
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,800
In confusion.

88
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,040
Enjoy your meal

89
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,280
and don’t forget to think of me.

90
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,480
Q!

91
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,200
Come here!

92
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,280
Wow.

93
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,000
Your lunch looks special.

94
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,600
You want me to poke your eyes, huh?

95
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,680
Thank you.

96
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,960
Oho.

97
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,520
Peem, where did you buy it?

98
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,560
It looks mouthwatering.

99
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,400
Why don’t you tell him someone bought it for you?

100
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,280
Someone bought it for you?

101
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,960
Phum?

102
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,080
Are you saying

103
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,520
Phum has started making a move on you already?

104
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,880
Well,

105
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,520
do you want Pun to help us sell on the gallery event day?

106
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,720
Come on.

107
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,160
Changing the topic fast, huh?

108
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,320
What are you guys selling?

109
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,200
It’s for the gallery.

110
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,040
This year, we’ll let other faculties sell their stuff, too

111
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,920
to attract more people.

112
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,960
Count me in.

113
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,120
Can I join, too?

114
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:27,840
Sure.

115
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,440
If a lot of people come, it’ll be fun.

116
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,840
Are you also running a booth?

117
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:33,720
Uh-huh.

118
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,520
I’ll open a portrait drawing booth.

119
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,920
He’ll play music.

120
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,760
Really?

121
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,000
What song do you want to hear?

122
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,120
Hold on.

123
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:42,320
You asked him to choose a song.

124
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,760
Are you singing for him only or what?

125
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,840
What if I am?

126
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,600
I must focus on what’s important to me.

127
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,560
He’s my brother, not an object.

128
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,320
But your brother is mine.

129
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,320
Am I right?

130
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,960
We’re in a canteen.

131
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,760
Let’s eat already.

132
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,840
Can I move to another table now?

133
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,120
Here we go.

134
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,680
After you press the coffee powder in,

135
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,400
put it here.

136
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,560
Then, choose the amount of water.

137
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,200
Auntie, do you need my help?

138
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,400
What are you doing here?

139
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,520
Me?

140
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,640
I’m here to…

141
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,720
Come on, Peem.

142
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,520
Phum is just helping me make some coffee.

143
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,840
Why are you being so loud?

144
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:35,840
Nothing.

145
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,840
I was just doing a vocal warm-up.

146
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:39,280
Why are you doing it now?

147
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,400
You’re so loud.

148
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,799
I was startled.

149
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,919
Come on, Peem.

150
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,560
Leave it to me.

151
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,760
Alright.

152
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,160
Don’t worry.

153
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,080
Oh, I’ll serve the coffee.

154
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,000
Oh, dear.

155
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,240
How was your vocal warm-up?

156
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,360
Why did you say that? Can’t you see where we are?

157
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,000
I’ll wear it for you.

158
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,160
I’m here to flirt with you.

159
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,160
You’re cute.

160
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,960
I’ll get to work.

161
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:41,760
Peem.

162
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,560
Huh?

163
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,720
You made it yourself?

164
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,720
Taste it now.

165
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,760
But I added a love potion.

166
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,560
From now on, you’ll certainly be head over heels in love with me.

167
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,560
Haven’t I fallen for you enough already, huh?

168
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,760
What did you say?

169
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,600
It tastes fine.

170
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,120
Peem.

171
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,480
Are you free?

172
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,200
Yes.

173
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,360
Buy me some milk.

174
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,400
Sure.

175
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,800
Do you want to come with me?

176
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,480
Yes.

177
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,600
The store isn’t far from here.

178
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,920
I’ll ride a bicycle.

179
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,600
Let me ride it.

180
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:47,840
Move.

181
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,600
Come. Sit here.

182
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,680
Do you think you can do it?

183
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,320
You’ll see.

184
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,520
Why don’t you hug my waist?

185
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,440
Aren’t you afraid of falling?

186
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,080
Now, I feel more like

187
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,600
pulling your neck and hitting you with my knee.

188
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,280
Hey.

189
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:09,800
Phum.

190
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,040
Ride properly.

191
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:11,680
It hurts.

192
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,600
Hug my waist.

193
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:19,920
Phum.

194
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,320
Guin, do you think this movie is fun?

195
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,040
Are you enjoying it?

196
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,000
I’ll be right back.

197
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,360
Eh?

198
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,400
What brings you here?

199
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,280
I’m visiting Guin.

200
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,480
How is he doing?

201
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:43,600
Come in.

202
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,560
He’s better now.

203
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,880
The vet said

204
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,560
once he’s healthier,

205
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,440
I need to release him quickly,

206
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,160
or else he can’t return to his natural habitat.

207
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,800
Why are you buying so much stuff?

208
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,400
These are for Guin.

209
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,000
I bought some food and essentials.

210
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,480
And this.

211
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,400
What is it?

212
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,240
It’s for Guin’s daddy.

213
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,320
Whoa.

214
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,800
How did you know I like it?

215
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,240
You literally eat everything.

216
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,320
Great job.

217
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,120
You know me well.

218
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,000
Come here.

219
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:34,440
Great job.

220
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:34,880
Great job.

221
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,280
Great job.

222
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,280
Let’s eat.

223
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,440
Guin, eat a lot.

224
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,280
Once I release you,

225
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,040
it’s hard for you to find food on your own.

226
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,480
Eat already, Pun.

227
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,360
Give me a second.

228
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,280
Pun, eat a lot.

229
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,120
After I release you,

230
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,960
it’s hard for you to find food on your own.

231
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,160
When did you start petting me?

232
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,160
Do you want me to do that?

233
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,200
Let’s eat now.

234
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,080
For me?

235
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,400
Alright.

236
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,760
You’re getting on my nerves.

237
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:18,880
Eat.

238
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,360
Eat it up.

239
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,040
We’re back.

240
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,040
Yeah.

241
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:28,920
Thanks.

242
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,000
Here you are.

243
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,200
Were there a lot of customers while we were away?

244
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,000
Quite a lot.

245
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,120
Luckily,	 you two are helping me.

246
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,560
Let me help.

247
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:54,760
Let’s get to work.

248
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,880
Auntie, I’ll clean up those tables.

249
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,360
Alright.

250
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,640
I’ll help you serve orders then.

251
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:15,840
Do you need my help?

252
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,400
Can you carry it yourself?

253
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:29,960
Come on.

254
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,160
You think I can’t?

255
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,720
Wait there.

256
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,520
Thank you.

257
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,000
Phum, thanks a lot for today.

258
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,040
You must be exhausted.

259
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,080
It’s alright.

260
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,000
By the way,

261
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,400
are you going back to your condo now?'

262
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,360
Yes,

263
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,720
but I think I’ll be so lonely if I go back.

264
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,200
I heard you’re sleeping at your house tonight.

265
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,520
Well,

266
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,600
Peem, take him for a walk.

267
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,240
Do some exercise before he goes home,

268
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,000
so he will sleep well.

269
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,160
Yeah.

270
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,600
The water is sweet.

271
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,560
Nonsense.

272
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,640
This is just regular water.

273
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,680
It’s because you served it.

274
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,440
That’s why it’s sweet.

275
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,720
Do you want to taste it?

276
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,000
I’m leaving.

277
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,640
You’re taking it back?

278
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,600
Phum,

279
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:01,760
you like me?

280
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,520
Why are you asking?

281
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:09,480
I want to know if you really like me.

282
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:12,640
I like you.

283
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,760
Are you really hitting on me?

284
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,640
I’m doing it now.

285
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:32,160
Why…do you like me?

286
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,560
Come on.

287
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,520
There are tons of reasons.

288
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,040
If you want me to mention all of them today,

289
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,120
I might have to sleep over at your place.

290
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,240
Look at you.

291
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,960
You’re always taking advantage of me.

292
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,760
You warm my heart when I’m with you.

293
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,480
I don’t feel lonely.

294
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,800
I feel happy.

295
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,360
I have fun.

296
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,200
You’re cute.

297
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,960
Stop.

298
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,000
I don’t want to hear anymore.

299
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:04,760
Why?

300
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,640
I haven’t said it all.

301
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,119
I told you I don’t want to know anymore.

302
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,839
How about you?

303
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,079
What do you like about me?

304
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,040
I don’t like you.

305
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,040
Fine.

306
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,280
It’s okay if you haven’t fallen for me yet

307
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,080
because, no matter what, you will like me soon.

308
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,120
Look at that.

309
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:34,640
What?

310
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,600
Watch it.

311
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,960
If you fall for me,

312
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,280
there’s no escape.

313
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,480
I’ll head home now.

314
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,840
Don’t miss me too much

315
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,440
because we’re seeing each other tomorrow.

316
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,480
You’re full of yourself.

317
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,120
Anyway, thanks a lot for the ride.

318
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,440
Hey, I have something to tell you.

319
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,600
Come closer.

320
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,560
What?

321
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,240
Quickly.

322
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,840
That’s for the ride fee.

323
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,360
Bye.

324
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:04,920
Hey.

325
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,760
You’re smiling like this again.

326
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,080
Did Peem cast a love spell on you?

327
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,680
Fang, don’t tease me.

328
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,840
You’re dating Tan.

329
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,520
Before I even knew it,

330
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,200
you confessed your love in the middle of the drinking party.

331
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,280
When did my brother turn into a young man?

332
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,400
Hey, Fang.

333
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,640
I’m no longer a kid.

334
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,960
You’re getting back at me?

335
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
- Stop.
- 	You dare do that to me?

336
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,480
You’ve grown up.

337
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,040
You’re so strong.

338
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,160
I give in.

339
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,040
Eat some snacks.

340
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,520
I’m not hungry.

341
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,000
I’m feeling happy now.

342
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,280
I don’t feel like eating.

343
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:41,960
Okay.

344
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,800
I think he’s cast a spell on you.

345
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,000
You're so into him.

346
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,400
Done.

347
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,360
Oho.

348
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,320
This is an amazing music band formation.

349
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,680
I think we can debut after the gallery event.

350
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:05,720
We?

351
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,640
You aren’t in this band.

352
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,480
Come on.

353
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,840
How can the band miss a main vocalist?

354
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,960
I can sing.

355
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,440
So can I.

356
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,680
There, there, Pun.

357
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,400
Speak clearly first

358
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,040
before even wanting to sing.

359
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,760
Chain!

360
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,560
Q.

361
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,840
Where are the other two?

362
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,320
Tan told me he’s running an errand today.

363
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,160
Peem?

364
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,160
Right. He hasn’t shown up yet.

365
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,200
No idea what’s taking him so long.

366
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,560
Hello? What’s up?

367
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,360
(Hello?)

368
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:45,960
(Where are you?)

369
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,360
It’s our band’s first rehearsal today.

370
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,280
Are you coming?

371
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:50,960
Eh?

372
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:51,800
Today?

373
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:52,840
(Yep.)

374
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,960
(So, are you coming or not?)

375
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,240
Alright.

376
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:56,720
Send me the location.

377
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,480
I’ll hurry there.

378
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,480
(Fine.)

379
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,080
Okay.

380
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,640
He’s coming soon.

381
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:06,360
Gathering at a studio like this reminds me of our school days

382
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,280
when we formed a band.

383
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,360
You guys played music before?

384
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,240
In an inexperienced style, you know.

385
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,160
We mostly watched Q practice.

386
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,160
You can say that again.

387
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,040
How could you say we were inexperienced?

388
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,600
We even formed a band then.

389
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,320
We did.

390
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,080
You only remember that kind of stuff, Pun.

391
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,760
Anyway, let’s play one song.

392
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,880
I’ll sing.

393
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,440
Please.

394
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,120
Please.

395
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,160
Fine.

396
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,200
Just one song.

397
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,520
Pun.

398
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,040
What are you doing?

399
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,480
I’m doing a vocal warm-up.

400
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,280
Why did you guys stop?

401
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,040
We’re getting hyped up.

402
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,360
I nailed it just now.

403
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,400
It’s you again, Pun?

404
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,000
I sing well, right?

405
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,080
It’s good you’re here.

406
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,120
Please put Pun away.

407
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,200
Toey, come over here.

408
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,120
I’ll sit there.

409
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,600
I’m rooting for you, Q.

410
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,600
You can do it.

411
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,240
Got it.

412
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:17,960
I’m so envious.

413
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,800
Someone is watching over you.

414
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,960
I’m so envious.

415
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,280
Your boyfriend is watching over you.

416
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,400
- Alright, then.
- 	No.

417
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,720
No.

418
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,800
Come with me.

419
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,240
Let Q sing properly.

420
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,680
I can sing well, too.

421
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,840
Listen to Q sing.

422
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,600
Show me how you sing.

423
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,320
Are we ready?

424
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:33,600
Let’s go.

425
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,680
Pun, tell me what Toey was like in school.

426
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,840
Oho.

427
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,000
Q?

428
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,760
I’ll talk about this then.

429
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,080
Listen up.

430
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:52,000
Not to brag, but I was the Student President back then.

431
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,400
Q and Tan were always getting into fights.

432
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,000
I always had to play peacemaker.

433
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,800
They fought with others often?

434
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,640
Let’s say the administrative teachers knew them well.

435
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,560
Let’s also talk about this.

436
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,720
Q used to be such a playboy.

437
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,040
Every day at school, he had a new date.

438
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:09,960
Seriously?

439
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,600
What’s with that face?

440
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,800
Don’t worry.

441
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,600
He only loves one person now.

442
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,960
You’re smiling already.

443
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,800
You’re smiling.

444
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,000
You’re smiling.

445
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,200
You’re smiling.

446
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:25,960
Why are you smiling?

447
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,160
Nothing.

448
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:27,920
Nothing?

449
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,120
♪ As long as we have each other ♪

450
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,320
♪ Spending every day together ♪

451
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,880

♪ Together, we are ♪

456
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,040
Do you want to go anywhere after this?

457
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,000
I can’t think of any.

458
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,400
Let’s go home then.

459
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,160
Let’s go to Oh’s cafe.

460
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,320
Since Q has already left,

461
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,160
the mic is mine now.

462
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,200
Are you really going to sing?

463
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:26,960
Yep.

464
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:27,680
Whatever.

465
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,400
I’m leaving.

466
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:28,880
Bye-bye.

467
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,640
Peem.

468
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,800
- Peem, don’t.
- Wait.

469
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:31,800
Don’t leave yet.

470
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,880
Eh? Beer?

471
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,560
Beer.

472
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,640
Don’t leave me.

473
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,680
You’re singing, right?

474
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,960
I’ll play the guitar for you.

475
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,560
Thank you.

476
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,280
You can play every kind of instrument?

477
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,960
How about the xylophone?

478
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:47,720
Huh?

479
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,600
Nothing.

480
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,040
Ready?

481
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,200
Sitting with you here again reminds me of the day

482
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,280
you got me a Milk Frappe.

483
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,440
I was really shocked that day.

484
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:07,720
Why?

485
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,840
You thought I’d figure out you’re Milk Frappe Boy.

486
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:14,240
You never mentioned Oh’s cafe before.

487
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,240
No wonder I would be shocked.

488
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,000
I’m sorry.

489
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,600
I told you not to say sorry again.

490
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,440
Let’s write on sticky notes.

491
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:27,920
For what?

492
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,800
To recall the past days.

493
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,120
Please.

494
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,040
Let’s write on sticky notes.

495
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,680
Fine.

496
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,560
Are you bringing sticky notes?

497
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,600
Of course.

498
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,120
I always carry them around.

499
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,880
You really brought them.

500
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,120
(Q, you’re handsome today.)

501
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,520
(You looked so cool while playing music.)

502
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,880
(What did Peem gossip about me?)

503
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,440
(He called you a playboy, who kept changing the girls you dated.)

504
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,760
(I’ll deal with him.)

505
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,960
Hey, don’t.

506
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,080
That’s not all he said.

507
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,600
What else did he say?

508
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,720
He said you aren’t like that anymore

509
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:20,000
because….

510
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,800
Because?

511
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,360
Because you’re only serious about one person now.

512
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,760
Do you believe him?

513
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,400
Is it true?

514
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,480
If you want to know if it’s true or not,

515
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,960
date me.

516
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,600
Huh?

517
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,840
[Be my boyfriend!!!]

518
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,320
[Yes, Q.]

519
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,600
Hey? Where are you going?

520
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,680
So, what’s the deal?

521
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:31,760
Toey.

522
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,960
Phum, Dad has returned from Beijing already.

523
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,400
He’s having a meal with us today.

524
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,000
He said he called you, but you didn’t answer.

525
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,200
Really?

526
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,640
I guess the connection wasn’t good.

527
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,440
I don’t know,

528
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,960
but I think this doesn’t seem right.

529
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,560
So, throughout this time,

530
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,160
what have I done wrong?

531
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:22,480
Fang, how’s your brother doing now?

532
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,080
He called me yesterday.

533
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,480
He said things are going well there.

534
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,880
He’ll make time to come back here at the end of this year.

535
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,760
Next Tuesday,

536
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:35,320
I’ll be the president at the new product launching event for Kiat.

537
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,960
I want Fang and Phum to join me.

538
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,520
Sure.

539
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,720
But Phum has been busy with his studies recently.

540
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,400
He probably can’t make it.

541
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,440
Is that so?

542
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,720
Fang, how are your studies going?

543
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,240
Not too bad.

544
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,960
You did well last semester.

545
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,880
Keep it up this semester.

546
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,280
How about you, Phum?

547
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,640
You usually don’t pay attention to me.

548
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,200
Why now?

549
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,880
Why did you say that to your dad?

550
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,120
I’m paying attention to you now.

551
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,760
Everything I’ve done is for you.

552
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,640
Have you ever asked me if I want it or not?

553
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,800
I’m full.

554
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,640
Please excuse me.

555
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,440
Phum.

556
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,240
Fang, don’t.

557
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,320
We’re already closed for today.

558
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:56,880
What’s wrong?

559
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,680
Can I hug you?

560
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,520
Come here.

561
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,080
Something serious?

562
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:14,880
Kind of.

563
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,480
Are you okay?

564
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,480
I haven’t seen you like this before.

565
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,000
Are you free tomorrow?

566
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,120
(Hello? What’s up, babe?)

567
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:58,880
Where are you?

568
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,760
Can we meet up?

569
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,000
(Is something wrong?)

570
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,960
(Why do you sound like that?)

571
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,760
I’ll tell you later.

572
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,159
Phum argued with Dad again.

573
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,120
Oh.

574
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,120
I don’t want them to be like this.

575
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:22,040
If Dad had put family before work back then,

576
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,400
things wouldn’t have turned out this way.

577
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,280
Though our business is already back on track,

578
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,440
Phum’s feelings aren’t the same anymore.

579
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,040
The moment he returned from abroad,

580
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,639
I could still remember the look in his eyes clearly.

581
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:41,360
It has remained my trauma until today.

582
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,280
What should I do, Tan?

583
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:50,159
Babe, don’t overthink it

584
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:54,520
because you’ve done your best all this time.

585
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:02,400
I think Phum already knows his brother loves him the most.

586
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:17,000
I believe Phum will feel better one day.

587
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:22,280
Also, he has Peem now.

588
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,240
He should feel better soon.

589
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,000
But seriously, I really have to thank Peem.

590
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,840
Since Peem came into his life,

591
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,200
Phum smiles more often.

592
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,200
He laughs more,

593
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,240
and he seems happier.

594
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:42,080
I think that’s Peem’s special talent.

595
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,280
He can make those around him smile.

596
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,280
I’ve been hoping all this time

597
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,480
for Phum to have someone by his side,

598
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,280
just like me having you here

599
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,440
because family can’t always be our safe zone.

600
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:11,320
But I want to be both your safe zone and your family, babe.

601
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,160
There you go.

602
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,920
You’re smiling already.

603
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,080
You already are.

604
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:17,800
Pardon?

605
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:21,360
Though I act unreasonable and don’t behave well sometimes,

606
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,600
if one day you feel you no longer want to be with me,

607
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,680
just tell me straight

608
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,880
because if you disappear,

609
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,680
I would be in so much pain.

610
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,440
Come on, babe.

611
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,320
Look at me.

612
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,600
I’m so crazy over you.

613
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,800
How could I dump you?

614
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,720
I love you.

615
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,440
I’m head over heels in love with you.

616
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:47,760
I love you a lot.

617
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,320
I love you a lot.

618
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,040
Stop it.

619
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:49,960
It’s embarrassing.

620
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,960
There’s nobody around.

621
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,720
Anyway, thank you

622
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:04,480
for loving me, even when I’m not always adorable.

623
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,920
Come on, babe.

624
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,560
Your eyebrows, ears, nose, eyes, and mouth are all adorable.

625
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,280
So are other things about you.

626
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,920
I love you no matter what.

627
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,040
I love you, too.

628
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,280
Eh? “You”?

629
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,280
That one?

630
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:21,880
This one?

631
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,480
The tree?

632
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:23,520
Who is called “You”?

633
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,960
Who’s named like that?

634
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,920
Fang loves Tan.

635
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,120
Come on, say it again.

636
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,560
Say it loudly and clearly.

637
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,240
One, two, three.

638
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,240
I said, Fang loves Tan.

639
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:36,720
Come on.

640
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,960
You weren’t loud enough.

641
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,920
I don’t like it.

642
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,800
Fine.

643
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,720
Fang loves Tan.

644
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,000
Oh, I’m blushing.

645
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,440
I’m so happy for your mom

646
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,840
for having such a cute son like you.

647
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,640
You’re exaggerating.

648
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,320
I’m not.

649
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,640
Alright. I’ll stop.

650
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,320
Tan loves Fang, too.

651
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,200
What?

652
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,200
I couldn't hear it.

653
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,720
Tan loves Fang, too!

654
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,200
I already know that.

655
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,320
Tan loves Fang!

656
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,160
I already know.

657
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,360
Love you too.

658
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,080
Alright. I won’t get too loud.

659
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:17,640
But I love you.

660
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,320
I already know.

661
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,160
Let’s grab something to eat.

662
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,520
[Ticketing]

663
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,040
Ever been on a train before?

664
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:53,600
Nope.

665
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,600
I was right.

666
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,120
Let’s go.

667
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,040
Come.

668
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:22,680
Smile.

669
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,640
Smile.

670
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,240
Move.

671
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,920
Say cheese.

672
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:46,440
Cheese.

673
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,560
What cheese?

674
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:50,960
One more time.

675
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,800
Cheese.

676
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,520
Cheese.

677
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,640
What a forced smile.

678
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,480
Thanks a lot.

679
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,720
For?

680
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,000
For staying by my side.

681
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,600
Sit there. It feels cool.

682
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,200
Head out.

683
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:31,760
What?

684
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,840
Move your face forward

685
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,520
and stick your tongue out.

686
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,400
What?

687
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,120
Come on.

688
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:38,920
Like a Golden Retriever.

689
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,960
Go “woof, woof.”

690
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,000
Woof, woof?

691
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:44,720
Yeah.

692
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,240
How does that look cute?

693
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,920
We’ve finally arrived.

694
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,000
It took forever.

695
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,080
My butt is achy.

696
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,720
That sounds like you’ve never been on a train.

697
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,200
Come on.

698
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,600
It’s been a while for me.

699
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,800
Let’s take some rest for now,

700
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,640
and eat something later.

701
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,680
You have pretty good taste for choosing this hotel.

702
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,200
At first, I thought I wouldn’t be able to sleep.

703
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,280
Why?

704
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,600
Is this room too ordinary for you to sleep?

705
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:40,960
I can sleep here.

706
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,440
It’s not bad.

707
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,360
I approve.

708
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,560
Okay.

709
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,400
Does my face look that adorable?

710
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,800
Why are you smiling when looking at me?

711
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,720
You’re closing your eyes.

712
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,320
How could you know I’m looking at you?

713
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,240
I’m using my radar.

714
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,760
And when can your radar finally detect it?

715
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:25,960
Detect what?

716
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,280
My feeling.

717
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:32,080
When will you finally know that I love you?

718
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:43,880
Let’s go.

719
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:44,600
Let’s find something to eat.

720
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,200
Hold on.

721
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,000
You haven’t given me your answer.

722
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,760
I thought I did. Can't you tell?

723
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:54,520
I can’t.

724
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:03,960
This side, too.

725
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:08,840
Let’s eat.

726
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:09,360
I’m hungry.

727
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,560
Hold on.

728
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:11,200
Phum.

729
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:15,520
Stop.

730
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,320
I’m hungry.

731
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:23,520
Let’s eat later.

732
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:06,920
Whoa.

733
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,600
Lots of food.

734
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:11,960
You’re hungry. Eat a lot.

735
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,120
Eh? You aren’t eating?

736
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:15,960
I’m allergic to seafood.

737
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:17,120
Huh?

738
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:18,960
Why are you confused?

739
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,240
We’re at the sea,

740
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,240
so we must eat seafood.

741
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:22,440
Don’t worry.

742
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:23,960
I’ve already ordered what I can eat.

743
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:25,720
This is not a big deal for me at all.

744
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:26,840
I can pay.

745
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:28,760
So, I won’t hold back then.

746
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:30,640
Go ahead.

747
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:35,160
Yummy?

748
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:36,800
To the max.

749
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:42,920
Do you want some?

750
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,480
Peem, smile.

751
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:59,720
It’s nice traveling like this with you.

752
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,920
I must thank you for bringing me.

753
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,680
Phum, can you ride a horse?

754
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:12,560
Of course.

755
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:14,000
Why?

756
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:15,280
Do you want to ride it?

757
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:17,680
Well, I do.

758
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:18,800
But I guess I shouldn’t.

759
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:19,280
I’m scared.

760
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:20,680
You have me here with you.

761
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:23,040
You don’t have to be scared.

762
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,360
You want to ride a horse, right?

763
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:25,600
I’ll handle it for you.

764
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,680
Phum, don’t.

765
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:28,840
Phum, come back here.

766
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:29,600
Don’t.

767
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:31,280
Why?

768
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,360
You said you wanted to ride a horse, didn’t you?

769
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:35,000
Uh-huh.

770
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:36,920
He won’t bite you.

771
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,280
Touch him.

772
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:44,440
Ride it.

773
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:46,480
Hurry up.

774
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:47,200
Don’t be scared.

775
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:53,960
Hold this.

776
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,480
Step here.

777
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,000
Slowly.

778
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:00,160
Don’t be scared.

779
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:02,760
Are you ready?

780
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:04,160
Yeah.

781
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:12,920
I feel like I’m a prince

782
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:15,320
with a servant walking a horse for me.

783
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,840
Someone like you as a prince?

784
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:18,840
Why?

785
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,440
Why can’t I?

786
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:22,640
Annoying.

787
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:23,760
Should I let go?

788
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:24,440
Stop.

789
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:26,800
Don’t let go.

790
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:29,080
Fine.

791
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:29,960
I know that.

792
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,280
Who would do that to you?

793
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:32,040
Right?

794
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:47,200
Beautiful, isn’t it?

795
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,840
Why did you bring me to the sea?

796
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:55,560
I don’t know.

797
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:58,000
I just thought this place could make you feel better.

798
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:08,000
Don’t you want to know what happened to me?

799
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:13,240
If you want to talk about it, I know you will.

800
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:26,240
Actually, I argued with my dad.

801
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:34,800
You know what?

802
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,560
When I was a kid, I never wanted to study abroad.

803
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:41,960
Even now, I still don’t understand

804
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,960
why Dad sent me to study abroad alone.

805
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:49,560
What’s more,

806
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:52,920
I wondered why Mom didn’t object to it even once.

807
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:59,560
Back then, I was alone and isolated.

808
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:03,400
I cried every day.

809
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:11,480
But luckily, Fang always called me,

810
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,320
consoling me

811
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,480
and keeping me company so I wouldn’t cry

812
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:23,520
despite such a big timezone difference.

813
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:27,000
He always called me.

814
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:29,920
He woke up to talk to me no matter how late it was.

815
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,600
But things aren’t the same anymore.

816
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:37,760
No matter how much Dad tries to approach me

817
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,240
and talk to me now,

818
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:43,200
I still feel distant.

819
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:46,520
The more he tries to approach me,

820
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:51,480
the less I want to stay there.

821
00:48:58,480 --> 00:48:59,080
Peem.

822
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:00,360
Yeah?

823
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,440
Can I hug you?

824
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:19,240
I can’t remember the last warm hug I got.

825
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:23,120
Why are you thinking about that last hug?

826
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:25,000
Just focus on the hug you’re getting now.

827
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:36,720
I’m sorry, Peem.

828
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,360
I’m sorry for treating you badly.

829
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,040
Apology accepted,

830
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:45,360
but I won’t forgive you.

831
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:51,440
I’ll wait and check on your behavior first.

832
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:58,400
Stop making that sad puppy face, Puppy Phum.

833
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:00,480
Hey, cheer up.

834
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,080
What are you doing?

835
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,600
My hair is a mess now.

836
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:08,000
You’re a puppy.

837
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:12,200
You already did very well.

838
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:21,920
Thank you for everything.

839
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:27,400
Thank you for brightening my life.

840
00:50:58,680 --> 00:50:59,280
What?

841
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,200
Are you two already dating?

842
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:33,640
Uh-huh.

843
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:35,200
Don’t feel slighted.

844
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:36,920
Our couple will celebrate like them soon.

845
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:41,760
I have something fun to offer.

846
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:43,240
To get back at him.

847
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:44,360
He made you his servant.

848
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:45,120
Huh?

849
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:46,560
Peem is Phum’s servant?

850
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,840
I think Toey has probably spread fake news already

851
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:49,520
Huh? What?

852
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:50,880
You need to speed up to win his heart.

853
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:51,640
What should I do?

854
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,400
You’re asking the right person.
