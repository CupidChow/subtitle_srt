5
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:18,630
You two are already dating?

6
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:19,360
Since when?

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:19,840
How?

8
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:20,980
Who asked first?

9
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:22,780
Let’s celebrate the new couple.

10
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,400
Cheers.

11
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:26,420
I’ve finished my work.

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,570
I don’t know

13
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,030
what it would feel like if you weren’t here.

14
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,490
I only know that I love you.

15
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:35,750
Well, then,

16
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:36,870
should we start dating already?

17
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:38,080
Nope.

18
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:39,250
I almost said yes,

19
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,360
but you’re annoying me a bit.

20
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,280
Finally, your work is displayed next to mine.

21
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:46,930
So, this is how it feels.

22
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,120
THE NIGHT BEFORE THE GALLERY EVENT

23
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:53,530
So, what do you think about

24
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,740
this whole thing with Phum?

25
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:00,360
Be honest with me.

26
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:01,720
You guys are still mad at him, right?

27
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,060
Or aren’t you mad?

28
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:08,110
I’m mad,

29
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,630
but look at that guy.

30
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:14,810
You all know how much Peem likes Phum.

31
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,280
Also, I don't think Phum is that bad.

32
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:23,060
I guess he also feels guilty.

33
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:26,440
You know this best, don’t you?

34
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:29,620
Yeah, I do.

35
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:35,780
I think

36
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:37,960
it's between them,

37
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,890
and there's not much we can do.

38
00:01:41,289 --> 00:01:43,710
But I know you're all worried about him,

39
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,039
and so am I.

40
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:50,830
But, ultimately, it's Peem’s decision how to handle it from now.

41
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:57,200
Q, let me say something.

42
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,760
This is the first time you’ve said something freaking good.

43
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:01,710
Reasonable.

44
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:02,640
True.

45
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:05,010
He said exactly what I was thinking.

46
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:06,840
Agreed.

47
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:09,800
Eh? Where is Peem?

48
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,280
Oh, there he is.

49
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:18,570
Why did it take you so long to arrange stuff?

50
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,070
Long? It wasn’t long at all.

51
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,060
Come here.

52
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,990
Sit down.

53
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,100
You should sleep already so you’re energized for tomorrow.

54
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:28,750
Right?

55
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:29,420
Yeah.

56
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,340
That’s right.

57
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,960
That’s right.

58
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,810
Why the confused face?

59
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,250
Nothing’s going on here, really.

60
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,160
I’m taking a shower.

61
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,110
Alright.

62
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:42,790
Hurry up and shower.

63
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:43,920
You smell bad already.

64
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:45,190
What’s wrong with him?

65
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,750
Just forget about it.

66
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:47,450
I feel tired today.

67
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,440
I’m going to bed now.

68
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,600
Hey, did you shower yet?

69
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,700
Q, you didn’t shower, right?

70
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,450
Go.

71
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,130
- Get up.
- 	Hold on.

72
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:56,870
What?

73
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:57,690
You take a shower every day?

74
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,390
I do.

75
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,000
Take a shower already.

76
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,130
But I won’t. I’m tired.

77
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:01,210
If your mind is clean,

78
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,460
taking a shower isn’t necessary.

79
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,720
- Let’s sleep.
- 	He’s right.

80
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,460
He’s right.

81
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,000
Sleep.

82
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,800
What’s wrong with you guys?

83
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,450
What are you doing over there?

84
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:08,940
Not sleeping?

85
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,150
I’ll take a shower after Tan.

86
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,020
Come on.

87
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,030
I’ll shower after Tan.

88
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:12,590
Sleep now.

89
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,060
Change the pose,

90
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:16,740
so you’ll sleep comfortably.

91
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:17,710
Stop.

92
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:18,760
Q, Pun,

93
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,280
stop pretending already.

94
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,020
Go downstairs and shower.

95
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:21,850
The bathroom downstairs is vacant.

96
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:22,430
I’m not going.

97
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:23,640
No way.

98
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,200
Pun.

99
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:24,630
No way.

100
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,220
I’m not going.

101
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:25,840
Come here.

102
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,280
Nope.

103
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,110
I won’t.

104
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,250
Tan.

105
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,740
Where are you taking me?

106
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:30,930
Tan, open the door.

107
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,550
Tan.

108
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,540
What?

109
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:37,240
Shit.

110
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:38,860
What a tiny one.

111
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,850
What the hell did you say?

112
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:41,760
What’s wrong with you guys?

113
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:42,920
You’re acting like you haven’t seen it before.

114
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:44,920
Will you come in or not?

115
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,760
Tan, don’t.

116
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:47,290
Go.

117
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:47,890
Close the door.

118
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:48,610
Hurry up.

119
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,070
Are you thinking the same thing?

120
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,270
Q, take a shower.

121
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,160
Go.

122
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,730
- I can go myself.
- 	No way.

123
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,430
I can go myself.

124
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:56,120
Go.

125
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:56,950
Take a shower.

126
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,010
Chain, take a shower.

127
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:08,070
Go.

128
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:09,790
Are you going or not, huh?

129
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,120
What am I seeing now?

130
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:17,700
Shit.

131
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:20,220
Why is mine the biggest here?

132
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,670
Finally, you made it.

133
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:02,570
Absolutely.

134
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,690
I’m looking forward to your band’s performance.

135
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,840
I’ve heard your members are super handsome.

136
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,450
Who told you that?

137
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:13,640
Your boyfriend did.

138
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,570
You’re exaggerating.

139
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,530
I’ll get back to my booth.

140
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,120
See you.

141
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:20,800
See you.

142
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:28,990
How about you?

143
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,980
You’re checking out the gallery first, right?

144
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,080
You? You aren’t?

145
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,190
I’m lazy.

146
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:37,080
After you’re done,

147
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,090
join me at the booth.

148
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:39,880
See you later then.

149
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:40,500
I’ll join you soon.

150
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:41,320
See you.

151
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:07,940
Eh?

152
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:09,800
You actually came.

153
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,510
What’s with that greeting?

154
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:13,240
Were you just trying to be polite when you invited me that day?

155
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,240
No. That’s not it.

156
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,750
Thank you.

157
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,100
Which one is your work?

158
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,410
Take me to see it.

159
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:32,810
Sure.

160
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,270
Let’s go.

161
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:39,580
Here it is.

162
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:43,520
Whoa.

163
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:50,750
It’s beautiful.

164
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:52,950
Thanks.

165
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,260
Honestly, you didn’t have to buy this for me.

166
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,910
Your work is on display this time.

167
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:03,040
This gift is no big deal.

168
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,680
Let’s head to my booth.

169
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:07,480
I’ll draw your portrait.

170
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:17,800
[Portrait Drawing]

171
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,730
Which style do you want?

172
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,360
Definitely a handsome one.

173
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:23,310
Handsome?

174
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:24,740
Just sit tight.

175
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:43,750
Whoa. This looks adorable.

176
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,050
This isn’t free.

177
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:45,900
Pay up.

178
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:50,120
I’m kidding.

179
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:57,520
Well, I have to leave now.

180
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,710
Alright.

181
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,160
Thanks a lot for coming.

182
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:02,970
Here you are.

183
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,730
It’s a thank-you gift from me.

184
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,440
See you later.

185
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:33,100
What’s that?

186
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:35,670
Peem drew this for me.

187
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,740
Pretty cute, huh?

188
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:41,760
I’m kidding.

189
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,430
When I see you, I feel like teasing you.

190
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:44,600
You’re irritating, you know.

191
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,950
No matter what,

192
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:52,920
I’m not the person Peem chooses.

193
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:58,360
So, don’t hurt him again.

194
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:01,400
Don’t worry.

195
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,590
That won’t happen again.

196
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:11,020
Good luck.

197
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,110
[Faculty of Engineering.]

198
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,240
Do you want some sausages?

199
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:26,910
Won’t you take that one, too?

200
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:27,240
I’m sorry.

201
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,070
He’s just recovered,

202
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,060
so that’s why.

203
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,200
Do you need my help?

204
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,000
Babe.

205
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:33,970
Should I get you something to eat?

206
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:35,510
Here you are.

207
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:37,200
I made this especially for you.

208
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,330
A heart-shaped treat.

209
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:41,110
You should sell it.

210
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:42,030
Don’t worry.

211
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,760
Guys, please take care of the booth for me.

212
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,350
Let’s go.

213
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,460
Leaving them here, huh?

214
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:48,740
Yep.

215
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:50,290
- Let’s go, babe.
- 	Help me sell this.

216
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,080
20 baht.

217
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:52,970
20 baht.

218
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,100
Babe,

219
00:10:58,130 --> 00:10:59,100
let’s check out that booth over there.

220
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,510
Eh? Tan.

221
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:03,500
Hey, Fai.

222
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:05,970
Hey?

223
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,270
You know each other?

224
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,220
Can I call you my ex?

225
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:14,950
Come on. Why not?

226
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,700
Although it was only a couple of months,

227
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,620
I still counted it as dating.

228
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,240
Check out my booth.

229
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,960
I’m selling DIY bracelets.

230
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,320
Let’s make this one.

231
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:26,480
Alright.

232
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,730
Take a seat over there.

233
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:50,380
That was ages ago.

234
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,410
Huh?

235
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,080
What are you talking about?

236
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:55,640
My thing with Fai.

237
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,560
That was a long time ago.

238
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,310
Don’t overthink.

239
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:02,800
I see.

240
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,140
Here you go,

241
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,920
Make yourself at home.

242
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,000
You’re cute together.

243
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:22,410
Let’s make matching bracelets.

244
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,460
Sure.

245
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:27,600
Let’s do it.

246
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:31,660
Nose.

247
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:33,880
You can draw my portrait, right?

248
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,760
Why not?

249
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:37,480
I can draw you all my life.

250
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,520
You’re the cutest.

251
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,060
Oh?

252
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:52,540
Is that bouquet yours, Peem?

253
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,020
Who's it from?

254
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:56,010
It’s from Kluen.

255
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,600
It’s Kluen again.

256
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:03,910
But I didn’t bring you any gift.

257
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,560
Are you sulking?

258
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:06,390
Nope.

259
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:12,890
Hello?

260
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:14,750
Okay.

261
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,360
I’ll be there soon.

262
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:18,400
Chain told me to get ready backstage.

263
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:18,990
Go ahead.

264
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:19,800
I’ll join you guys soon.

265
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,450
Peem.

266
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,310
Yeah?

267
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,310
You can stay here alone, right?

268
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,240
Just go.

269
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:25,880
Let’s get moving already.

270
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:26,340
He’ll be fine.

271
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,050
Let’s go.

272
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,020
Here you are.

273
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,400
Thank you.

274
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,400
How cute.

275
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,170
Babe, give me your hand.

276
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,830
I’m not a dog.

277
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:42,280
Not like that.

278
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,790
Your hand, quickly.

279
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,280
Come on.

280
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:50,090
I’m kidding.

281
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,400
You should wear the one with my name on it

282
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:54,680
to show everyone you're dating Tan.

283
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,460
Nice. It’s pretty loose,

284
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,080
so I will drop easily.

285
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:57,730
Babe.

286
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:03,400
Wear it for me, too.

287
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:04,450
This one?

288
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,400
Please.

289
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,730
Whoa. How cute.

290
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,530
How about a kiss?

291
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:17,800
Kiss.

292
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:18,240
Kiss.

293
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,220
I kissed your hand.

294
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:20,300
Kiss.

295
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,320
Kiss.

296
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,040
Babe, how cute you are.

297
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,130
Let’s take a photo.

298
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,320
Here we go.

299
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,300
Cute, right?

300
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:56,230
Fai, is it almost Q's performance time?

301
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:56,820
Q?

302
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,480
I think it’s about to start.

303
00:14:58,530 --> 00:14:59,050
Oh?

304
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:00,570
So, let’s go together, shall we?

305
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:05,790
You two go ahead.

306
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:07,280
I’ll tidy up my booth first.

307
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,160
Okay.

308
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,990
Babe, let’s go.

309
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:13,640
Let’s go.

310
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:23,240
Draw my portrait.

311
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,360
Our booth is closed.

312
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,390
Please, Peem.

313
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,070
Please draw it for me.

314
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:32,440
I want to see you do it.

315
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,060
Please.

316
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,990
Please draw one for me.

317
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:39,570
Or what’s the deal?

318
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:40,820
Or are you afraid that,

319
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:44,680
staring at me for a long time will make your heart race?

320
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,350
You’re talking nonsense.

321
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,420
Please.

322
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,610
Draw one for me.

323
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,080
Turn left.

324
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:27,950
Right.

325
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:26,619
Almost done?

326
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,680
I'm heading to catch the concert now.

327
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:36,840
I’ll go with you.

328
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,800
It looks good,

329
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:45,480
but not as handsome as the real me.

330
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:53,240
I know you’re good at this,

331
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:55,530
but I want to show you my support.

332
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,730
I’ll wait in front of the stage.

333
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,040
That’s it?

334
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,170
Best of luck.

335
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,130
Q, come on.

336
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,780
I saw that.

337
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,420
So did I.

338
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:25,050
Be quiet.

339
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:28,770
Hello, everyone joining us at the Faculty of Fine Arts today.

00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:31,850

365
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,100
Wow.

366
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,560
Q is really a maestro.

367
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:52,710
Where are Tan and Fang?

368
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:54,680
I’m here.

369
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:55,130
Move.

370
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:57,480
Hi, buddy.

371
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,930
Peem, this is for you.

372
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,360
As promised,

373
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,350
if your work got displayed,

374
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:05,110
I said I'd give you a bigger bouquet than Q's.

375
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,640
I thought you already forgot.

376
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:08,230
No way.

377
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:09,180
I have a good memory.

378
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:12,420
This is for you, Q.

379
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,460
It’s smaller, but don't sulk.

380
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,400
XOXO.

381
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,680

00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,240
As is our tradition,

384
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:23,800
let’s take some selfies.

385
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,660
One, two, three.

386
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,770
My babe is so cute.

387
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:37,280
I’m sick of him.

388
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,030
I have only checked out the booths.

389
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,240
I haven’t seen the gallery.

390
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,170
Q, give me a tour.

391
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,190
Sure.

392
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,150
I'm coming too.

393
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,480
Chain and I haven't checked it out either.

394
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,500
Let’s go.

395
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,940
And whoever wants to do something, hurry up.

396
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,400
Doing what?

397
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,330
Let’s go, babe.

398
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:56,170
Let’s go.

399
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:57,400
Sending a signal?

400
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:58,200
I can show you around.

401
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,330
Hold on.

402
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:07,950
What’s up?

403
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,940
I haven’t talked to you about your painting yet.

404
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:23,960
It’s beautiful.

405
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,070
By the way, what’s the meaning behind it?

406
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,310
Nothing complicated, actually.

407
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,790
I just drew the things I like.

408
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,390
I told you I like water.

409
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,960
How about these flowers?

410
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:46,840
What’s the meaning?

411
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:50,250
I just felt like drawing them.

412
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:51,530
I think

413
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,090
flowers added a livelier vibe to my drawing.

414
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:58,040
Honestly, the original piece you messed up included just water,

415
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,510
and it was finalized.

416
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,810
But when I redrew it,

417
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:07,790
I felt my feelings had changed.

418
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:09,340
That’s why I added them.

419
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:13,730
I think they best reflect my feelings.

420
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:24,440
Peem.

421
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:32,140
Do you remember when you said

422
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:36,360
after finishing this, you'd cancel our deal?

423
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:41,190
Well,

424
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,330
can I propose a new deal then?

425
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,500
What’s that?

426
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:54,690
Will you date me?

427
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:15,720
Peem, please.

428
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,310
Date me.

429
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,320
Uh-huh.

430
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:31,090
Uh-huh?

431
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:34,200
Fine.

432
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:34,920
I will.

433
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,460
That sounds like you don’t really want to.

434
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,350
Don’t be demanding.

435
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,550
So, we’re together now, right?

436
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,350
You’re my boyfriend now.

437
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:00,300
What are you doing?

438
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:02,000
We’re in the gallery.

439
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,400
Only this will do for now.

440
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,650
Thank you, Peem.

441
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:54,070
You think you’re tiny, huh?

442
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:24,440
Is everyone in love acting like this?

443
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,410
Buddy, you’re in such a dreamy mood.

444
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,490
You can’t stop smiling.

445
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,280
It's like all you do is smile.

446
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:29,580
Your grin goes from ear to ear.

447
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:39,970
Speaking of the devil…

448
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,920
You enjoy teasing me that much, huh?

449
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,080
To the max.

450
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,000
Hello? What’s up?

451
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:49,960
(Where are you?)

452
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,670
At the library.

453
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:52,400
What’s up?

454
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:53,330
(No.)

455
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:54,130
(Nothing.)

456
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:56,520
Then why are you calling?

457
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,510
He just wants to talk to you, I guess.

458
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:01,860
(Well, I miss you.)

459
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:04,120
Pardon?

460
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:07,850
(I said I miss you.)

461
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,390
You’re shy,

462
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:13,400
but don’t do this to me.

463
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,310
It seems like you’re really free, Puppy Phum.

464
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:18,490
I’ll get back to work.

465
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,240
(Hold on.)

466
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,200
(Don’t hang up yet.)

467
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:22,410
(I’ll pick you up this evening.)

468
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:24,280
See you then.

469
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,010
You made me blush.

470
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:32,530
Can you stop blushing already?

471
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:34,020
Can you?

472
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:34,960
Nope.

473
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,840
Look at you and Toey.

474
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:39,410
You said, “He’s mine,” didn’t you?

475
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,380
“I’ll pick you up this evening.”

476
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:43,570
“He’s mine.”

477
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:45,110
“Yes, Puppy Phum.”

478
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:45,990
“Let’s go, Toey.”

479
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:46,920
“Let’s go there together.”

480
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,470
Wait for your boyfriend.

481
00:27:57,850 --> 00:27:58,840
Oh.

482
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,000
Oh? Eh?

483
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:02,590
Electric shock?

484
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,720
Come on, Auntie.

485
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,290
Why?

486
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,540
Friends can hold each other’s hand.

487
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,480
It’s totally fine.

488
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:10,870
Take your friend to sit there.

489
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:11,990
I’ll cook.

490
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:13,080
I’ll let you know when it’s done.

491
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:13,580
Yes.

492
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,090
Aunt Pui.

493
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,080
We aren’t friends.

494
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:32,560
Don’t joke around.

495
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:33,460
No kidding, okay?

496
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,930
Don’t.

497
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,580
I’ll pass out.

498
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:38,040
I’m swooning over this.

499
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,630
I’m bleeding.

500
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:43,020
If I die today, I’ll rest in peace.

501
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,550
It will be the happiest death ever.

502
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,270
Right?

503
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:46,210
Auntie, just cook.

504
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:46,780
Go already.

505
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:47,630
I don’t want to cook.

506
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:49,100
Can we buy something to eat instead today?

507
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:50,240
Go, Auntie.

508
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:51,280
Go.

509
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:51,960
Peem.

510
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:52,870
One more time, okay?

511
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:53,730
Auntie.

512
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:54,950
Oh my gosh.

513
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,170
My nephew!

514
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:00,120
How could you do that? See where we are?

515
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:01,320
Don’t you care about my aunt at all, huh?

516
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:15,930
Hello?

517
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,840
Hi there.

518
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:21,200
(I’m calling to check if my son is still alive.)

519
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,920
(You haven’t been in touch at all.)

520
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,280
You miss me?

521
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:26,090
(Of course.)

522
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:29,870
(If I don’t miss my dearest son, should I miss any dog out there?)

523
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:33,580
(Come back home. Dad misses you too.)

524
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:34,720
Yes.

525
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,870
I’m planning to visit during this long holiday.

526
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:38,610
I’ll stay with you for many days.

527
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,220
(Bring your friends, too.)

528
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:42,320
(I miss your four besties, too.)

529
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:43,930
Sure.

530
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,890
(I’ll hang up.)

531
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,030
(That’s all I got.)

532
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:46,730
(See you soon.)

533
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:48,070
Yeah. Bye.

534
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:51,800
What?

535
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:52,920
Who called you?

536
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:54,360
Why?

537
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:57,990
Will you tell me or not who you talked to?

538
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:00,700
I won’t.

539
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,760
So, will you tell me nicely,

540
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:07,000
or do you want me to kiss you?

541
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:12,860
I won’t tell you.

542
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,440
You said it yourself.

543
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,590
My mom.

544
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,080
Really?

545
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,250
So, my mother-in-law called?

546
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:26,020
So what?

547
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,130
Are you jealous?

548
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,320
It’s nothing.

549
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,640
She just called,

550
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,150
telling me to go back to Chiang Mai to see them.

551
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:35,820
Really?

552
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,340
Let me go with you.

553
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:40,120
Eh? I haven’t invited you yet.

554
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,700
So, you're leaving your boyfriend alone here, Peem?

555
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,900
I’ll help Auntie Pui cook.

556
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,970
What?

557
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:52,760
Call me nicely

558
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,070
and promise me

559
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,290
you’ll introduce me to your family.

560
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:03,940
Call me nicely.

561
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:10,040
Peem will take Phum to see Peem’s parents in Chiang Mai.

562
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,960
Deal, my boo?

563
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:14,760
Alright.

564
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:20,850
What is it now?

565
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,150
Kiss my cheek.

566
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:26,630
Happy now?

567
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:29,210
I’ll get going.

568
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:38,700
Peem, I didn’t add any sugar to the food.

569
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,610
Today’s vibe is already so sweet.

570
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:42,590
Here you are.

571
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,780
Peem’s boyfriend,

572
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,200
you can eat this, right?

573
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:48,260
Yes.

574
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:51,080
Auntie, why did you call him that?

575
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:51,750
Eh?

576
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,240
Please call me like that.

577
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:54,030
I like it.

578
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:55,910
Peem’s boyfriend.

579
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:57,160
Peem’s boyfriend.

580
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:58,010
Peem’s boyfriend.

581
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,000
Peem’s boyfriend.

582
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,140
Peem, I’ll be away next week,

583
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,780
attending a seminar in Singapore.

584
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:05,250
Alright.

585
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:08,080
Let your boyfriend take care of you.

586
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:09,750
I’ll take good care of him.

587
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:10,380
Don’t worry.

588
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:12,490
Whoa.

589
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:23,730
Why are you grinning by yourself?

590
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:26,750
I’m planning

591
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,580
how to ask your mom for your hand in marriage

592
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,270
after meeting her in Chiang Mai.

593
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:35,420
Or how about getting engaged first?

594
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:36,580
Stuff and nonsense.

595
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,410
Phum.

596
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,240
I’ve waited for so long.

597
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:50,240
Now that I'm finally dating you,

598
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,300
I can't wait anymore.

599
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:12,760
I’ll help Aunt Pui wash the dishes.

600
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:29,790
Babe, take a shower first.

601
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,080
I’ll get some food ready for you.

602
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:34,630
Come on. Go shower.

603
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:36,200
I’ll prepare something for you to eat.

604
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:37,920
Let me rest for a bit first.

605
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,350
What’s wrong?

606
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,440
Tired?

607
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:13,630
Pat my head, too.

608
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,150
The vet said Guin is healthy.

609
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:49,480
So, why the sad face?

610
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,620
The faster he gets stronger,

611
00:34:53,389 --> 00:34:56,199
the sooner I have to let him go.

612
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,340
I haven’t seen this side of you before.

613
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,570
I see Guin every day when I return to my room.

614
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,780
If I don’t see him one day, I must feel so lonely.

615
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:15,840
Should I keep you company instead of Guin?

616
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:22,680
Yeah.

617
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:24,040
Drop by often.

618
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:27,790
Promise?

619
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:39,490
Look at him playing with the water.

620
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:43,890
Guin.

621
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:46,880
The water splashes everywhere.

622
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:11,430
We’re here.

623
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,390
Mom, I’m back.

624
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,560
Whoa.

625
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:20,180
I thought I’d never see you again.

626
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:21,350
You’re exaggerating.

627
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:23,190
Hello, Mom.

628
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:24,190
Hi.

629
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:25,040
Where is Dad?

630
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:26,590
He’s at work.

631
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:28,950
He’ll be back in the late evening.

632
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,830
He complained he wanted to see me.

633
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,290
Now I’m here, and he’s away.

634
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:33,780
How have you been?

635
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,070
It’s been a while.

636
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:36,090
Are you doing well?

637
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,270
Yes, Mom.

638
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:38,270
These are my friends.

639
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:39,290
They want to travel around.

640
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:40,880
Please take care of us.

641
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,360
Make yourselves at home, kids.

642
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,350
Peem’s friends are like my own sons.

643
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:46,360
The more, the merrier.

644
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,430
Mom.

645
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:51,590
Mom, this is Toey I told you about.

646
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,960
What do you think? Adorable, right?

647
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,080
Hi, Toey.

648
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:55,880
You have good taste.

649
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:58,850
Have you all eaten?

650
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,120
Do you want me to cook something for you?

651
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:01,550
I can help with that.

652
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:04,550
Hey. I think you shouldn’t.

653
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,610
Toey, let’s go.

654
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,870
- Mom, I’m heading inside.

655
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,490
Come on.

656
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,200
I want to cook.

657
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:08,870
I’m good at cooking.

658
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,550
I just didn’t get to show my skills at the camp.

659
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,550
I don’t want to call a fire truck.

660
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:14,520
Mom, listen to what he said.

661
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,480
I think you should find something else to do,

662
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,550
like sitting and doing nothing.

663
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,130
Mom, this is my boyfriend.

664
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,280
You all came in couples.

665
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,600
What do you think?

666
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:25,580
Heartwarming, right?

667
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:26,930
It’s nice.

668
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:35,610
Babe.

669
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,950
It’s for you.

670
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:41,180
It’s the love I have for you.

671
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:44,700
Do it properly, or the tree will die.

672
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,950
Aw, my babe is cute.

673
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:51,810
You want me to do it right

674
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:54,400
so it grows like our love, right?

675
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,120
Do you want a spittoon over there?

676
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:07,330
Your face is messy.

677
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:11,490
Where?

678
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,060
On the left.

679
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,600
Left? Here?

680
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:17,460
Nope.

681
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,530
The other side.

682
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:19,810
Here?

683
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:20,520
Move up.

684
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:22,250
I mean, the other side.

685
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:25,140
Come on.

686
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,550
The more you wipe, the worse it gets.

687
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,090
Your whole face is stained now.

688
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,920
Wipe it off for me then.

689
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:37,330
My hand is dirty too.

690
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:40,820
How is it? Is it clean now?

691
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:44,280
I don’t know.

692
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:45,590
What?

693
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:47,720
I have to check first.

694
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:57,980
This side is alright now.

695
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:00,220
How about this side?

696
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,650
Smells so good.

697
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:05,530
Hey,

698
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,800
there’s something on your face.

699
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:09,790
Nothing.

700
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:38,610
Mom, need my help?

701
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:41,260
You can’t cook.

702
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,010
What else can you help with?

703
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,110
Come on, Mom.

704
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:46,450
Cook the rice, then.

705
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,140
Alright.

706
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,950
What can I help with?

707
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:53,420
You’re Phum, right?

708
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:54,540
Yes.

709
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:57,510
Peem talked about you often.

710
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:58,700
Mom.

711
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:00,260
Who did that?

712
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,560
Don’t make things up.

713
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:02,800
I don’t know.

714
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,760
I’ll cook the rice.

715
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:07,240
You can help Peem in the kitchen.

716
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,760
I’ve got this covered.

717
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:09,400
Sure.

718
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:20,470
You talked about me often?

719
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:23,450
What exactly did you tell her?

720
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:27,770
Tell me.

721
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,720
What did you tell her?

722
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:36,130
I just mentioned

723
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:38,200
how you like teasing me.

724
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:49,240
Help me here.

725
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:51,880
Do it yourself.

726
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:55,870
You’re sulking?

727
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:58,940
Come on.

728
00:40:58,960 --> 00:40:59,880
You’re already sulking just because of this?

729
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:02,120
Alright. I’ll tell you.

730
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,580
I just told her

731
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:10,260
there’s one handsome guy

732
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,250
taking me to different places.

733
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,630
He might seem tough,

734
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:17,800
but deep down, he’s like a big softie.

735
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,130
He gets stubborn

736
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:22,140
and pouts often.

737
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:26,580
It seems

738
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,650
you’re obsessed with how handsome I am.

739
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,160
Seriously?

740
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:31,520
After all that,

741
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,150
that’s the only thing that got into your head?

742
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:38,640
Did you tell your mom

743
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:41,220
you’ve got that handsome guy as your boyfriend?

744
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:52,260
Cook the rice already.

745
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,400
Here you are.

746
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:11,340
These look delicious.

747
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:13,650
I've missed your cooking so much.

748
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:15,000
He’s such a smooth talker.

749
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:15,920
Thank you.

750
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:16,660
Yeah.

751
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:19,150
I want some pork rind.

752
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:20,340
Why don’t you eat it then?

753
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:21,820
I haven’t washed my hands.

754
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,880
I’ll feed you.

755
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:27,820
Why are you moving it away?

756
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,220
Tasty?

757
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:33,800
Matt, did you wash your hands?

758
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,690
Bro, I went to the restroom.

759
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:36,440
To wash your hands?

760
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:37,150
(To poop.)

761
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:41,240
Mick, tell Matt if it’s delicious.

762
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:43,590
It might taste a bit weird.

763
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:44,210
Full of charms.

764
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:45,880
Charm, charm, charm.

765
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:50,360
Yummy.

766
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,380
It’s so delicious, Mom.

767
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:54,490
Eat up.

768
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,040
You'll need the energy for tomorrow's travels.

769
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:56,580
Sure.

770
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:57,450
Toey,

771
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,320
you're also like this, huh?

772
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:00,640
You’re good at making people adore you, aren’t you?

773
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,470
Look at you with those raised eyebrows.

774
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:06,460
Mom, can we drink tonight?

775
00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:07,930
It's been a while since we partied together.

776
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:09,810
Let's do it.

777
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:12,150
It's been ages since I had someone to drink with.

778
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:13,020
Come on, Mom.

779
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:15,220
You just had drinks with the neighbor the other day.

780
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:17,700
But not with Q in a long time.

781
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,780
Right?

782
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,470
Shut up already.

783
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:22,060
It's a mom-and-son conversation.

784
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:24,130
See, I'm just the stand-in son.

785
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:25,130
Yes, that’s right.

786
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:30,360
I just went to the toilet too.

787
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:31,750
Peem!

788
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:34,600
Cheers.

789
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:35,500
Cheers.

790
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:36,540
Cheers.

791
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,580
Cheers.

792
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,590
Whether in Bangkok or Chiang Mai,

793
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:42,160
this always happens at my place.

794
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:42,920
You guys are real drinkers.

795
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:45,910
Bro, blame Q for that.

796
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:48,420
We aren’t usually drunkards.

797
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,370
I wouldn't believe it even if you swore on a stack of Bibles.

798
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:51,190
How is that my fault?

799
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:52,610
Don't blame me.

800
00:43:57,470 --> 00:43:58,930
I’ll get some more.

801
00:43:58,970 --> 00:43:59,560
It's already watered down.

802
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:00,680
Not strong enough.

803
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,690
What a true drinker he is.

804
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:03,560
Exactly.

805
00:44:04,870 --> 00:44:05,560
Alcoholism.

806
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:07,410
Having a good time?

807
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,470
Do you need anything else?

808
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:09,650
Dad will be back soon.

809
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:11,520
Can we ask him to buy something for us?

810
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:12,810
Of course.

811
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:15,620
Please grab 10 boxes of pork.

812
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,610
10 bottles of each mixer,

813
00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:18,970
5 bags of ice,

814
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:19,340
vegetables,

815
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:20,340
and that one also.

816
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,960
Isn’t that a bit much?

817
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:23,180
I’m kidding.

818
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:23,870
We’re good.

819
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:24,360
Thank you.

820
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:25,110
Yeah.

821
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:25,650
Mom, here you go.

822
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:28,380
Thanks.

823
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:31,240
You're always trying to get my mom drunk.

824
00:44:32,090 --> 00:44:34,570
Peem, is that your dad?

825
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:36,440
Hey.

826
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:38,160
Hi, Dad.

827
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:38,990
Hello.

828
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:39,680
Hello, everyone.

829
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:40,280
Hello, Dad.

830
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:41,590
We missed you so much.

831
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:44,490
It’s been a long time since your last visit.

832
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:45,500
Where are you going?

833
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:46,190
I’m getting a glass for Dad.

834
00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:47,930
Who are these six guys?

835
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,000
You don’t look familiar.

836
00:44:49,350 --> 00:44:50,240
Cat, are they your new friends?

837
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:51,890
He is…

838
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:52,560
Hold on.

839
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:54,220
Cat?

840
00:44:56,390 --> 00:44:57,310
Phum.

841
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:58,670
Khaofang.

842
00:44:59,180 --> 00:44:59,780
Mick.

843
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:00,580
Beer.

844
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:02,940
Those two are my juniors, Toey and Matt.

845
00:45:04,690 --> 00:45:06,040
And you’re Cat.

846
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:09,820
I can’t believe

847
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,820
someone like you has so many friends.

848
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:12,360
Come on.

849
00:45:12,850 --> 00:45:14,360
Let me know if you need anything.

850
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:17,040
Cat, take good care of your friends.

851
00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:18,590
Got it.

852
00:45:18,610 --> 00:45:20,840
But I’m sure you need a drink, Dad.

853
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:21,650
Here you are.

854
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:23,400
You can always read my mind.

855
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:24,910
I made it strong. I’m sure you’ll like it.

856
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:27,670
Show them around tomorrow.

857
00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:29,830
I guess you’re all from Bangkok.

858
00:45:30,410 --> 00:45:31,410
Don’t worry.

859
00:45:31,450 --> 00:45:32,300
I’ve already planned a trip for them.

860
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:33,230
They’re going all out tomorrow.

861
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:34,830
Have fun then.

862
00:45:35,050 --> 00:45:36,120
Sure, Dad.

863
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:42,410
Why are you just sitting like that?

864
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:43,160
Have a drink with me, too.

865
00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:45,160
Cheers.

866
00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:46,740
Have a drink with me, too.

867
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:48,500
Here we go.

868
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:52,810
Cheers.

869
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:54,140
Don’t worry.

870
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:55,400
I can carry my parents.

871
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,210
Why are you smiling, Toey?

872
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:08,900
Cat.

873
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,480
Who’s Cat?

874
00:46:14,210 --> 00:46:16,100
It’s cute to call you that.

875
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,100
You were born in Chiang Mai, right?

876
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:21,770
So you can speak the Northern dialect, can’t you?

877
00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:23,550
Show me.

878
00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:25,580
I won’t.

879
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:29,060
Why not?

880
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:30,430
I want to hear it.

881
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:31,330
Say it.

882
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:33,790
What do we call it?

883
00:46:33,810 --> 00:46:36,220
Northern dialect talking?

884
00:46:40,450 --> 00:46:42,220
Dude, I love you.

885
00:46:43,310 --> 00:46:43,940
Donkey.

886
00:46:45,850 --> 00:46:46,810
What does that mean?

887
00:46:46,850 --> 00:46:48,670
If you want to know, look it up yourself.

888
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:58,650
Amen.

889
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:01,770
Toey, guess what?

890
00:47:01,810 --> 00:47:04,110
I almost got to keep a penguin at home.

891
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:05,400
Really?

892
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,240
How did that happen?

893
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:09,820
I asked my dad

894
00:47:09,850 --> 00:47:11,550
to buy an ice bucket for me,

895
00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:14,140
but it wasn’t cold enough,

896
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,090
so I missed a chance to keep it with me.

897
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:16,000
Really?

898
00:47:17,110 --> 00:47:18,900
Why didn’t you keep it in the refrigerator?

899
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:22,020
The freezer wasn’t cold enough, Comrade Mick.

900
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:23,810
Guys, quiet down.

901
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:24,730
I want to sleep.

902
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:34,550
I’m hungry.

903
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:36,550
Anything to eat?

904
00:47:36,590 --> 00:47:38,300
I have some.

905
00:47:38,330 --> 00:47:39,680
I have some bread in my bag.

906
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:40,520
Give it to me.

907
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:41,900
Where is it?

908
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:47,280
Here.

909
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,020
Let me check the expiry date.

910
00:47:50,490 --> 00:47:51,270
Shit. It’s today.

911
00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:52,550
What time is it now?

912
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:53,900
Oh, it’s 11.50 PM already.

913
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,490
You’d better eat it quickly.

914
00:47:56,870 --> 00:48:00,630
It expires in 10 minutes.

915
00:48:00,770 --> 00:48:01,190
True.

916
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:01,780
That’s right.

917
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:03,550
Let’s share.

918
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,140
Can I have a bigger piece?

919
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:07,590
This one will do.

920
00:48:10,490 --> 00:48:11,840
Can you sleep already?

921
00:48:12,650 --> 00:48:13,940
Or should I handle you two?

922
00:48:53,310 --> 00:48:54,660
What are you doing, Chain?

923
00:48:56,630 --> 00:48:57,630
I’m hugging you,

924
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:58,800
so you won’t feel hungry.

925
00:49:13,770 --> 00:49:14,410
Goodnight.

926
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:37,190
What’s going on with you two?

927
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:41,900
You should sleep already.

928
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:44,590
Goodnight.

929
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:01,850
Guys, are we really walking up there?

930
00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:06,010
Hang in there.

931
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:06,640
You can do it.

932
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:07,420
Since we’re here,

933
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:08,600
let’s pay respect to the Buddha image and make some merit.

934
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:09,830
Don't just think about indulgences.

935
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:12,660
Ouch. That hurts so bad.

936
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:13,040
Let’s go.

937
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:14,300
- Are you talking about yourself?
- 	Not me, definitely not.

938
00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:15,710
Can you do it?

939
00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:17,810
Easy peasy for me.

940
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:19,150
I bet it’s going to be hot.

941
00:50:29,970 --> 00:50:31,500
Help me, Chain.

942
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:34,580
Are you alright?

943
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:37,440
I’m good, I think.

944
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:43,160
Walk properly.

945
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:43,870
We’re almost there.

946
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:44,850
I’m tired already.

947
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:46,800
Any chance there's an elevator?

948
00:50:53,710 --> 00:50:54,970
I can give you a piggyback ride.

949
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:11,930
I get to travel only once in a while,

950
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:13,570
so I want to enjoy it as much as I can.

951
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:14,920
Q, look at that star.

952
00:51:14,970 --> 00:51:15,610
Cute.

953
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:18,860
My favorite view.

954
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:26,290
Can’t you sleep alone?

955
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:27,400
I don’t have anyone to hug.

956
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:28,680
Just a hug?

957
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:30,840
What’s up this Saturday?

958
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:32,420
Oh? It’s Phum’s birthday.

959
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:35,170
Happy Birthday, Puppy.

960
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:37,690
Thanks for being born so I could love you.
