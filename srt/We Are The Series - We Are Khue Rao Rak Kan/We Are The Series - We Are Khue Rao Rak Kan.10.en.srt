5
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,780
It seems Chain has already won your heart.

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,290
You told me to act like I usually do.

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,570
How could I stand it?

8
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:27,500
What are you doing?

9
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:28,610
Your hair smells good.

10
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:39,630
You freaking take advantage of me.

11
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:40,980
Let me have a goodnight kiss first.

12
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:44,240
Thank you.

13
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:46,000
Goodnight.

14
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,200
Phum, don’t.

15
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:53,560
Let me smell this side too.

16
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,170
Thank you.

17
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:06,170
Goodnight.

DIRECTED BY SIWAJ SAWATMANEEKUL

19
00:03:59,190 --> 00:03:59,940
You’re up already?

20
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,130
Where are you going?

21
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,440
Feeling shy after hugging me all night?

22
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:13,080
Who hugged who?

23
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:14,110
Be clear.

24
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:15,450
Why?

25
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:18,190
You weren’t shy when you let me kiss you.

26
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,320
What was up with you yesterday?

27
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,570
You seemed really moody.

28
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,200
I just didn’t like it.

29
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,140
You didn’t like it?

30
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:37,060
You didn’t like what?

31
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,340
Just forget it.

32
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:39,890
Come on.

33
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:41,000
You didn’t like what?

34
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,800
You didn’t like what?

35
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,360
Huh?

36
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:44,870
Face me.

37
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,270
You didn’t enjoy this camp or what?

38
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,640
That’s not it.

39
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:48,490
Then what?

40
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:49,580
Well…

41
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:50,310
Then what?

42
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:51,060
Actually…

43
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:51,750
Peem,

44
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:53,790
you got up already?

45
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:54,380
Hey.

46
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,950
I made this for you.

47
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:00,720
Thanks.

48
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,020
I didn’t know you’re also here,

49
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,720
so I didn’t bring one for you.

50
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,520
I’m sorry.

51
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:07,490
It’s fine.

52
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,570
I’ll share with him.

53
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,290
Peem, why did you get up so early?

54
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,340
You too.

55
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,180
Hey, I’m going to shower.

56
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:29,170
Yeah.

57
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,090
What’s wrong with this guy?

58
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,830
Did I interrupt something?

59
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:41,460
You didn’t.

60
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,600
Can I ask you something?

61
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,010
Uh-huh.

62
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,940
What’s your relationship with Phum?

63
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:56,210
You don’t have to answer if you don’t want to.

64
00:05:58,510 --> 00:05:59,460
There’s nothing between us.

65
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,800
We’re just close.

66
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,610
I’m close with everyone in this camp.

67
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:04,040
I see.

68
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:05,910
I still stand a chance, then.

69
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,550
Huh?

70
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,910
Nothing.

71
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,920
Oho.

72
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:22,410
Well, please take care of this for me, then.

73
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,660
Pardon me?

74
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,690
Where are you going?

75
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,350
You aren’t helping us?

76
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:27,550
I need to help Q with painting.

77
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,320
- I’ll get going.
- 	Pun!

78
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:28,890
See you later.

79
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,270
Tan, keep fighting.

80
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:30,670
See you.

81
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:31,790
See you later, Tan.

82
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,880
You picked an easy task for yourself.

83
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,060
Look at this mess.

84
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:37,909
Can we even finish it today?

85
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,150
Alright, guys.

86
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,210
Let’s get to work.

87
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,590
Let’s get it done quickly.

88
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:43,950
- Move it.
- 	Handle it for me.

89
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:44,840
Beer, start working.

90
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:45,790
Mick, go ahead.

91
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:46,800
Do you think we’ll get to go home?

92
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,159
Babe, just stand here.

93
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,280
I’ll do it for you.

94
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:54,060
Where should we start?

95
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:05,380
Hey? Why are you making my babe do this?

96
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:06,650
Move. Move.

97
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:07,710
Let go.

98
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:09,880
Leave it to me.

99
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:10,730
Let go.

100
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:11,390
Are you sure you can handle it?

101
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,960
Yes.

102
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:13,750
Ouch.

103
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,610
Take this box, too.

104
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,680
How could you make time to keep fit?

105
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:20,800
Strong.

106
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,320
Ouch.

107
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:48,260
Hey. Are you alright?

108
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,050
I’m alright.

109
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:50,950
Let me see.

110
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:54,750
Dress your wound now.

111
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:55,780
It’s this small.

112
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:56,090
It’s fine.

113
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:57,460
Don’t worry.

114
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,159
I’ll take care of it.

115
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,120
Let me see.

116
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,250
What are you doing?

117
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,010
I’m alright.

118
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,700
It’s just a small cut.

119
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:16,770
Come with me now.

120
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,620
You’ll live.

121
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,600
Ouch.

122
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:24,560
Babe.

123
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:26,060
The paper cut my finger.

124
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:28,400
Eh?

125
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,500
So, can you tell me already what’s wrong?

126
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:40,330
I’m fine.

127
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:45,360
Come on.

128
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,670
Let me do it.

129
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,160
Cry out if it hurts.

130
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:53,810
It won’t.

131
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:55,340
Ouch.

132
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,850
Do it gently, will you?

133
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:33,480
There, there.

134
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:34,910
It will heal soon.

135
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,240
What did you just do?

136
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,580
I’m not a kid anymore.

137
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:42,750
If you aren’t a kid, why act like one?

138
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,380
What are you doing?

139
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,440
I’m comforting you like adults do.

140
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,470
I’ll get back to work.

141
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:26,780
Stay here.

142
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:27,760
Don’t go anywhere.

143
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,660
Don’t hurt yourself again.

144
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:31,640
Thanks.

145
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,760
What?

146
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:49,870
I’ll go with you.

147
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:52,890
Why? Didn’t you hear me?

148
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:54,180
I told you to stay here.

149
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:56,850
I don’t want to be alone.

150
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:00,990
Fine.

151
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:01,610
Come on, then.

152
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:02,640
Let’s go.

153
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:04,860
Come on.

154
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:05,920
You said you aren’t a kid,

155
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:07,320
but you can’t be alone?

156
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:09,700
Let’s go now.

157
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:33,700
What’s wrong?

158
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,450
Are you worried about Phum?

159
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:39,340
Peem is taking care of him now.

160
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,450
Don’t worry.

161
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:41,950
He’ll be fine.

162
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,340
Got it?

163
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,460
If you understood it, then…

164
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:56,200
Look at you. You’re frowning already.

165
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,170
Look at you.

166
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,370
Your boyfriend is standing right in front of you,

167
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,990
but you’re worrying about another guy.

168
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:03,570
Oh yeah right!

169
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:07,450
Phum is my brother.

170
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:09,900
Right.

171
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,070
Whatever.

172
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,170
Make up with me.

173
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:13,930
Do it.

174
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,280
Come on.

175
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,120
Make up with me.

176
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,030
Make up with me.

177
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:19,480
Make up with me.

178
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,580
Hey, guys.

179
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,670
I want to paint with you.

180
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,100
Sure, Pun.

181
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:31,120
But I think this is too plain.

182
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:32,460
Should we draw something on it?

183
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,720
Just paint.

184
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:36,000
No drawings.

185
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,520
Why, Q?

186
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,870
When the students walk into the school,

187
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,480
they’ll see some cute pictures.

188
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,530
Do you agree, Chain?

189
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:51,060
Good idea.

190
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,310
Toey, you asked Chain,

191
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:56,310
while knowing he never says no to you.

192
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:59,620
You’d better ask Pun if we can draw.

193
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:01,900
Go ahead.

194
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,650
I guess the kids will like it.

195
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:07,450
Let’s draw some pictures, Chain.

196
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:10,510
We can draw cute animals or flowers.

197
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,180
Sounds nice.

198
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:13,570
I don’t know how to draw.

199
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,460
Teach me.

200
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,440
Sure.

201
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:16,640
I want to draw, too.

202
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,540
Q, what should we draw?

203
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:20,480
Why are you asking me?

204
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,590
Whatever you want.

205
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:35,440
You’re alright now, right?

206
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,360
What took you so long?

207
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,770
I’m alright.

208
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:40,300
Peem already dressed the wound for me.

209
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:43,200
What a relief.

210
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,200
You worried my boyfriend.

211
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,430
Watch it.

212
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,430
I’m really alright.

213
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,290
Thanks a lot.

214
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,400
No problem.

215
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:53,030
I started to understand you already.

216
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,480
Your brother is really stubborn.

217
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,300
Phum, is your finger okay?

218
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,750
Do you need surgery?

219
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:02,430
Come on.

220
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:04,080
It’s just a wound.

221
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:04,900
My finger wasn’t torn.

222
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,000
I told you

223
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,390
he’ll certainly live.

224
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,820
Hey, don’t go.

225
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,470
I’ll hammer nails for you.

226
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,510
Come on, babe.

227
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,290
This is seriously a no.

228
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,690
Babe, if you do it, and it hurts your finger,

229
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:18,410
what should we do?

230
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,150
Babe, I’m worried about you.

231
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,300
Alright.

232
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:21,510
It’s just a small wound.

233
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,120
I can do it.

234
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,050
Nonsense.

235
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,320
Stay here and do nothing.

236
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:28,320
I told you your brother is stubborn.

237
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,040
Organize the books, and don’t hurt yourself again.

238
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:31,730
I’ll do it.

239
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:37,120
Listen to him.

240
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:38,970
Thanks a lot.

241
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:40,460
Still some more?

242
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:42,500
What?

243
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:44,880
Organize the books,

244
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:45,950
or else you’ll hurt yourself again.

245
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:48,810
Peem,

246
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,580
was Phum hurt a lot?

247
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:52,940
I already dressed the wound for him.

248
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:53,510
He’s fine now.

249
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:54,670
Thank you.

250
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:14,980
Chain, what do you want to draw?

251
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:15,790
I’ll teach you.

252
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,360
You draw.

253
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:18,540
I’ll color it.

254
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:19,550
Deal.

255
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,040
Chain, come with me.

256
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,140
Where to?

257
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,560
Just come. Follow me.

258
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:27,520
I have something to talk to you about.

259
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,390
Why don’t we talk here?

260
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:29,640
Just follow me.

261
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,570
You raised your voice at me, huh?

262
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:35,610
I’ll handle it.

263
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,880
Here we go.

264
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,080
A fight is about to begin.

265
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:45,550
Put your brush down.

266
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,340
Let’s watch them.

267
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:48,160
We can’t miss the climax scene.

268
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:00,650
What are you looking for?

269
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:04,930
What’s up?

270
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,680
What’s wrong with you guys?

271
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,920
Wanna see a fun match

272
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,480
between Chain and Q?

273
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,380
What are Q and Chain doing again?

274
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:19,930
If you want to know, check it out yourself.

275
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:23,380
I see.

276
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:46,330
Why?

277
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:47,460
What’s wrong with Toey and me?

278
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,180
Well…

279
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:52,340
If you have nothing to say,

280
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:52,860
I’m heading back.

281
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,520
Hold on.

282
00:16:58,930 --> 00:16:59,870
You like Toey?

283
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,109
If I like him, then why?

284
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:07,119
I didn’t think you’d be serious about him.

285
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,800
Chain, you should stop.

286
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,359
What did I do?

287
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,760
You know Toey likes me.

288
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:17,670
And?

289
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,000
Why then?

290
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:23,119
If you don’t really like him,

291
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:24,720
stay out of this.

292
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:25,410
Please.

293
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:27,740
Please?

294
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:29,200
For what?

295
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:30,700
Begging?

296
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,500
To get Toey back

297
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:35,500
or to get your love back?

298
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:41,150
If you don’t have feelings for Toey,

299
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,200
you have no right to stop me, right?

300
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,640
I like Toey.

301
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:53,250
Huh?

302
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,680
I like Toey.

303
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:58,840
What did you say?

304
00:17:58,870 --> 00:17:59,500
I couldn’t hear it.

305
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:00,450
I like Toey.

306
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,400
Keep it down.

307
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:04,930
That’s it.

308
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,330
You’ve tired us out for ages.

309
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:07,820
Show yourselves already, guys.

310
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:12,710
Huh?

311
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,690
Buddy, it took you almost forever to say it.

312
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:16,760
Congrats.

313
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,840
Why are you guys here?

314
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,090
Gotcha.

315
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:21,090
How was it?

316
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:21,920
It’s a surprise from us.

317
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:23,850
You all knew?

318
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:25,320
Whose idea is this?

319
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,680
Pun planned it.

320
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,180
Without him, you wouldn’t speak the truth.

321
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,150
A plan?

322
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,680
I pretended to hit Toey

323
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:34,850
to push you.

324
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:36,720
Alright.

325
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:38,880
Let’s clear things up on your own, both of you.

326
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,760
Matt, bring Toey here.

327
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,230
Toey, come out and talk.

328
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:49,650
They’re asking for you.

329
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:54,220
What’s wrong?

330
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,120
Our defendant of love, come here.

331
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:55,930
Come.

332
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,670
Come.

333
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:58,270
Come.

334
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,770
Stand here.

335
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,150
Well, talk it over.

336
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:04,800
We’re leaving.

337
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:05,570
Bye-bye.

338
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,480
Bye.

339
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,340
Bye-bye.

340
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:10,790
Matt.

341
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,790
What am I to you, Toey?

342
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:26,500
Well, I…

343
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,160
Did you have so much fun doing this?

344
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,540
You’re talking to me, so look at me.

345
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:33,210
Why?

346
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,440
You hate to see my face that much?

347
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,770
You’re teasing me, right?

348
00:19:58,450 --> 00:19:59,000
Why?

349
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,700
Do you think you're the only one who can tease?

350
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,590
I can’t believe you’ve made me feel this much.

351
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,810
Q, I can’t breathe.

352
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:35,350
Thank you so much

353
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:38,360
for having done this much for me.

354
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,840
It wasn’t for you.

355
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:45,590
I did it for my love.

356
00:20:59,160 --> 00:20:59,790
Q!

357
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,640
You’re teasing me again.

358
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,180
You’re fun to tease.

359
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,200
It took you ages to speak your mind.

360
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,580
I almost gave up so many times.

361
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:25,540
Really?

362
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,820
Q, don’t.

363
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,210
Honestly, I’m good at this.

364
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,760
I’m thinking about quitting the university

365
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:41,670
and turning into a cupid.

366
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:43,000
I think it works.

367
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,400
You’re the culprit.

368
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,170
Do you know how messed up I was?

369
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,790
Handle Chain first if you’re doing something to me.

370
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,210
Do I have something to do with this?

371
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,810
You do.

372
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:54,890
I was totally sold.

373
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,790
I’m a human, not an item to be sold.

374
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,440
It couldn’t be helped.

375
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,220
You were in denial.

376
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,640
Toey, grab some food with me.

377
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,360
Finally.

378
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:07,730
Has he asked you to become his boyfriend yet?

379
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:08,980
Nope.

380
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:09,980
There you go.

381
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,230
You slapped my head, didn’t you?

382
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,100
Stay here.

383
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,790
Are you helping or getting on my nerves?

384
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,960
Then, a baby frog tells its mom that

385
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,400
there’s a gigantic cow hurting all of its friends!

386
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,840
Fang, keep going!

387
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,700
Fang, keep going!

388
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,290
Fang, keep going!

389
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,390
Fang, keep going!

390
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,620
The turtle wins!

391
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:50,360
Is there anything else you want to play?

392
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,360
Hey. Come.

393
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:03,810
It’s freaking beautiful.

394
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:05,530
Whose work is this?

395
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,720
I think mine is also beautiful.

396
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:08,780
So is yours

397
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:09,810
but not as beautiful as mine.

398
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:11,410
Mine is better.

399
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,170
Freeze.

400
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:15,870
Toey, be careful. You might fall down.

401
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,610
Got it.

402
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,050
Freeze.

403
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,340
You lost.

404
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:22,640
Freeze.

405
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:37,460
Everyone, thanks a lot for the past 2 days.

406
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:39,860
I hope you’re taking home good memories.

407
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:44,200
Tonight, I’ve prepared a special performance for everyone!

408
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:48,620
Pun, move.

409
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,640
So, these two are performing a special performance you mentioned?

410
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:52,200
Exactly.

411
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:55,320
I’m bored of them already.

412
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:57,240
Or do you want me to sing instead?

413
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,420
No, thank you.

414
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,210
Just sit down.

415
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:01,700
Let them perform.

416
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,060
That’s right.

417
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,110
I think you should do nothing.

418
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,620
Do you guys know which song we’re singing?

419
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:10,810
Gotcha.

420
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,170
That sounded grand like it was scripted.

421
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,290
Buddies, it must be such a special song, right?

422
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:15,590
It must be that Grilled Chicken song, of course!

423
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,290
Let’s go.

424
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:18,820
Ptooey.

425
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:21,190
I’ll countdown.

426
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,280
Help me sing, okay?

427
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,120
3.

428
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,200
Hold on.

429
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,620
We need some dancers for this song, don’t we?

430
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:27,750
Matt.

431
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,220
Matt.

432
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,360
I’ll treat you to some drinks.

433
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:31,340
Don’t.

434
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,560
Dancing solo is lonely.

435
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,320
Get a friend to dance with you.

436
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,110
This guy.

437
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:34,880
Toey, go ahead.

438
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,480
Stand up.

439
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:36,430
Why must it be me?

440
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:37,630
Q is singing, so undoubtedly you must dance.

441
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,120
Q, we’re ready.

442
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,230

00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,680
Let me sit with you.

452
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,180
Go ahead.

453
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,550
I think I’ve really made the right decision coming to this camp.

454
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,010
Really?

455
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,990
I’m glad you said that.

456
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,510
Your friends are funny.

457
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,520

Q, Tan, Chain, Pun, and I have been friends since secondary school.

459
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,370
I just got to know the rest last semester.

460
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:56,800
Nice.

461
00:25:57,410 --> 00:25:58,420
You guys seem close.

462
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:15,720
Stop.

463
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:16,300
Stop this.

464
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:16,710
Stop.

465
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,090
I’m protective of him.

466
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:17,600
Stop dancing.

467
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,480
Stop dancing.

468
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:18,960
Sit.

469
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:19,400
Stop dancing.

470
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:20,100
Stop dancing.

471
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,820
Q, just sing.

472
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:22,430
Just sing and chill.

473
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:22,950
No more dancing.

474
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:23,300
I’m protective of him.

475
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:23,630
No more.

476
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:24,200
He’s tired already.

477
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,100
Fine.

478
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:40,330
I want to sing this song for one person

479
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,340

501
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,370
Ptooey.

502
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,810
Why are you playing a romantic scene here?

503
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,870
Keep the music going.

504
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:36,810
Let’s get hyped up.

505
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,910
Don’t overact.

506
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:45,310
What’s this, Q?

507
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:47,880
Why?

508
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:49,820
You don’t like it?

509
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,590
I’m not surprised it’s your doing.

510
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:03,480
Toey, you know what?

511
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,910
I once thought that

512
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:09,910
even if Milk Frappe Boy and you were two different people,

513
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:12,900
the only person

514
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:16,920
who can make me fall in love again must be you.

515
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:26,530
I’m sorry for hurting you many times.

516
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:29,610
It’s because I was such a coward.

517
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,350
I should have been braver,

518
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,930
admitting my own feelings

519
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,790
and recognizing that you’re special to me.

520
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,360
Stop saying sorry already.

521
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:53,100
If you say it again, I won’t love you anymore.

522
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:55,890
Can you do that?

523
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:56,900
I can’t.

524
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:58,680
But I’m just bragging.

525
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:02,830
10 THB for me?

526
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:17,940
Q,

527
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:23,150
do you really like me?

528
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:26,700
Why?

529
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:29,660
Nothing.

530
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,730
I was just asking.

531
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:37,410
I wouldn’t kiss someone I didn’t like.

532
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:54,310
I wouldn’t let someone who I didn’t like kiss me either.

533
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:02,020
Thank you for the flowers.

534
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,380
You’re welcome.

535
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:55,840
Why are you sitting here alone?

536
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:05,160
Does the wound hurt?

537
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,390
Let me see.

538
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:11,580
You don’t need to care about me.

539
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,780
If something’s bothering you, just tell me straight.

540
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:24,570
Are you two that close?

541
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:25,350
Huh?

542
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,510
What do you mean?

543
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:30,540
I saw Kluen and you stick together all day.

544
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,480
That’s why I asked if you two are that close.

545
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:35,720
Nothing much.

546
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:37,720
I guess we’re close.

547
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,040
He’s here solo,

548
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,840
and I’m the only friend he has in this camp.

549
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:43,520
But you’re my slave.

550
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:52,830
What’s that supposed to mean?

551
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:55,230
I don’t like seeing you with Kluen.

552
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:57,510
So what?

553
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,800
Does being your slave mean I can’t have other friends?

554
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:08,360
Being your slave doesn’t mean I have to do everything you say.

555
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,290
You heard all of that, didn’t you?

556
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:53,550
You’ve been his slave all this time?

557
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:59,200
Do you remember the time when I hurt him?

558
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,970
That’s when we started the deal.

559
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:08,110
When is this over?

560
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:15,730
But honestly, you don’t have to do it.

561
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:24,320
Or do you like Phum?

562
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:41,830
I don’t know.

563
00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:43,679
I’m confused.

564
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,400
I think

565
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:55,290
I know how you must be feeling now.

566
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:03,930
Let’s go.

567
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:05,580
Don’t keep them waiting,

568
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:08,320
or they will complain about where we disappeared to.

569
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:12,720
Let’s go.

570
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,760
Is something wrong?

571
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,050
I ruined it again.

572
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:34,520
What do you mean?

573
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:38,960
I got mad at Peem because of Kluen.

574
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,900
I told him I didn’t like seeing them together

575
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,680
because he’s my slave.

576
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:46,510
Phum.

577
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,240
I told you to show how you feel

578
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:52,120
but not in the way you just did.

579
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:55,230
Peem and you aren’t dating.

580
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:59,490
It’s not wrong for Peem to get to know others.

581
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,130
Also, you shouldn’t have brought up that slave deal.

582
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:07,000
Yes. I know.

583
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,020
But I was upset then.

584
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:12,660
I didn’t know why I said such a thing.

585
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:16,200
What should I do?

586
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,750
Find a chance to apologize.

587
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:25,360
Good luck.

588
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:44,720
Has anyone here ever heard of the story called “Knock, knock, kkkrrr”?

589
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:48,110
It’s the story about

590
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:51,750
two female students who lived in the female dormitory.

591
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,700
One of them was sick,

592
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:57,190
so she asked the other to buy Thai Fried Noodles In Thick Gravy Sauce for her.

593
00:36:57,230 --> 00:37:01,210
That friend agreed and decided to go downstairs to eat alone.

594
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:03,350
That sick friend waited.

595
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:05,670
One hour passed, and her friend hadn't returned.

596
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,160
Two hours passed, and she still hadn’t returned.

597
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,510
Then, she woke up again at around 10 PM.

598
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,090
She heard a sound from downstairs.

599
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,160
Her room was on the third floor.

600
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:19,130
It went like, “knock, knock.”

601
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:24,900
Then, the sound seemed to approach her room more closely.

602
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:27,760
The knock knock sound changed to “kkkrrr.”

603
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:31,110
She opened the door and found nobody,

604
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:34,890
but the noodle bag was hung on the knob.

605
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:37,520
Along the hallway,

606
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:41,200
there was a long line of water drops that went to the stairs.

607
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:44,490
After that…

608
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:52,820
Why did you hit me?

609
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:53,480
Why did you hit me?

610
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:54,840
I was scared.

611
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,010
There, there.

612
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:59,270
Come on.

613
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,700
When are they coming?

614
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:10,720
What time is it now?

615
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:11,490
I don’t have a watch on.

616
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,490
I don’t, either.

617
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:12,920
How about you?

618
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:13,900
Here I am.

619
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,660
What’s that?

620
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,980
A swim ring.

621
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:20,440
You haven’t seen one before, Q?

622
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:22,870
I just asked Chain to blow it up for me.

623
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:25,700
I mean, why are you bringing it?

624
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:28,080
Pun said we’re heading to the waterfall,

625
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,790
so I’m all prepared.

626
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:32,330
You’re bringing a duck swim ring to the waterfall?

627
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:34,880
Fine. Whatever. That’s your business.

628
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:39,320
Since all of us are here, let’s go to the waterfall.

629
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:41,030
Yay!

630
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,660
Hey, walk fast.

631
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:01,260
Be careful.

632
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,010
Chain.

633
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:06,490
Pun.

634
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:07,960
Guys, let’s play in the water.

635
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:10,660
Oho. You’re taking off your tee now, Mick?

636
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:11,750
What are we waiting for?

637
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:13,030
Mick?

638
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:14,470
Q, hurry up.

639
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,570
Babe, what are you doing?

640
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:19,100
I’m playing in the water.

641
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:21,100
You’re playing in the waterfall, but why are you taking off your tee?

642
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:21,830
Don’t do that.

643
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,350
I’m protective of you, babe.

644
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,850
Jump into the water just like this.

645
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:27,280
Come.

646
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:31,280
Toey, you have a swim ring but are still hugging me?

647
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:35,680
Let’s go.

648
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,430
Alright. Let’s go.

649
00:40:58,190 --> 00:40:58,610
Peem.

650
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,880
I’m sorry about last night.

651
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,980
I’m sorry for being that foolish to you.

652
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:15,440
I didn’t mean it.

653
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:20,530
Also, I have no right to stop you from being close to others.

654
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:23,220
I’m sorry.

655
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:28,520
Alright.

656
00:41:29,370 --> 00:41:30,510
Apology accepted.

657
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:32,870
Wait.

658
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:34,870
Just like that?

659
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:37,100
Why?

660
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:39,730
You apologized, and I accepted it.

661
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,560
That’s it.

662
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,390
Or what do you want?

663
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:42,470
Do you want me to remain angry?

664
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,820
But can I ask for one thing?

665
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,030
Next time, if something’s bothering you again,

666
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,040
just tell me straight.

667
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:55,760
I don’t like it when you don’t tell me what’s wrong.

668
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:03,390
Honestly, I also have something to tell you.

669
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:08,460
I’ve been thinking about canceling our deal.

670
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,080
What do you mean?

671
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:15,770
You don’t have to be my slave anymore.

672
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:16,950
We can’t do that.

673
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,820
I mean,

674
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:25,920
we can’t do that

675
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:27,260
because I always keep my word.

676
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,780
I agreed to do it,so I must do it until the end.

677
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:33,990
I don’t want to owe you anything later.

678
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:35,000
I don’t want that to happen.

679
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:38,320
You said that yourself.

680
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,810
From now on, if you cry again,

681
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:42,780
it can’t be helped.

682
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:47,880
Cry? Cry for what?

683
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,590
It’s you who will cry.

684
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:51,340
Eh?

685
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:52,990
Why should I cry?

686
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:54,980
Why should I cry then?

687
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:03,160
Peem!

688
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:03,660
Help!

689
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:05,320
Peem!

690
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:06,080
Alright.

691
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:07,250
I’ll help Toey.

692
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:23,270
How was it?

693
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,390
Did you talk it over with him?

694
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:26,670
Yes.

695
00:43:28,330 --> 00:43:30,560
From now on, keep it up.

696
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:35,060
Thanks a lot.

697
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,420
Babe, I’ll carry it for you.

698
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:03,970
Hand it to me.

699
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:05,510
Hey, move.

700
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,300
Why are you so uptight, huh?

701
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,430
Why did time fly so fast?

702
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:11,480
Agree.

703
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,200
I don’t want to go back.

704
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,690
You said that because you don’t want to get back to work, right?

705
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:17,580
Come on, bro.

706
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,580
You know I’ll be stuck working late again after I go back.

707
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:21,660
You always want to hurt me or what?

708
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:22,840
It’s not just you.

709
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:23,990
Talking about meeting the deadlines,

710
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:25,280
Kluen and I understand how you feel.

711
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:26,040
Right?

712
00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:28,920
But, babe,

713
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:30,420
no matter how much work you have to handle,

714
00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:34,340
I’m always here to support you.

715
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:37,160
Let’s get on the bus already.

716
00:44:37,190 --> 00:44:37,700
It’s hot here.

717
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:40,640
Fine. Let’s go.

718
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:41,030
Again.

719
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:41,940
Come.

720
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:43,520
Toey, come here.

721
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:50,350
Q, sit here.

722
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:56,340
Come on, Toey.

723
00:44:56,390 --> 00:44:57,180
Since you’re not using me anymore,

724
00:44:57,220 --> 00:44:58,600
you ditch me this easily?

725
00:44:58,640 --> 00:44:59,240
Why?

726
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:00,530
Are you sulking?

727
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:03,960
It hurts here.

728
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:05,310
Stop the drama, Chain.

729
00:45:06,490 --> 00:45:07,080
Just sit.

730
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:10,430
You took my seat, and now you’re shooing me away?

731
00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:11,120
Hurry up.

732
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,430
Pun, I’ll sit with you then.

733
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:18,830
Why are you sitting so close to me?

734
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:21,270
Eh? The seat is small.

735
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:26,880
Bye-bye.

736
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:27,400
Bye.

737
00:45:27,430 --> 00:45:28,020
Bye.

738
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:29,240
Bye.

739
00:45:29,270 --> 00:45:30,450
See you again, kids.

740
00:45:58,090 --> 00:45:58,650
Q,

741
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:01,240
I’m sleepy.

742
00:46:04,790 --> 00:46:06,030
Can I rest on your shoulder?

743
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:21,330
Q.

744
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,280
It costs a lot to lean on my shoulder.

745
00:46:27,370 --> 00:46:29,620
Do you offer a monthly buffet rate then?

746
00:46:37,410 --> 00:46:40,080
That’s a flat rate for one hour.

747
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:42,880
Just one hour?

748
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:44,750
How stingy you are.

749
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:51,000
If you stop leaning on me,

750
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,060
then we need to restart.

751
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,290
Thank you, everyone.

752
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:10,490
Bye.

753
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:11,400
Thank you.

754
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:14,170
Make sure you’ve got your own bags.

755
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:16,200
Don’t take your friend’s.

756
00:47:18,090 --> 00:47:18,920
Bye.

757
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:19,770
Safe trip home.

758
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:20,690
How are you getting home?

759
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,290
I don’t know yet.

760
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:24,200
I’ll figure it out.

761
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:28,620
Do you want me to give you a ride?

762
00:47:29,770 --> 00:47:30,680
I’ll give you a ride.

763
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:32,110
Let’s go.

764
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:36,990
See you.

765
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:44,280
Phum.

766
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:50,850
If you want to say something, just talk properly.

767
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:52,670
Didn’t you see I was talking to Kluen?

768
00:47:54,530 --> 00:47:58,460
I want to drive you home.

769
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:07,230
Let’s go.

770
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:10,880
Don’t be glum.

771
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,530
We’ve been on the bus so long.

772
00:48:27,970 --> 00:48:29,240
I’m also tired from the drive.

773
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:30,770
Let me go in to grab some drinks.

774
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:35,380
Please.

775
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:36,550
Let me go in.

776
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:44,940
Auntie, I’m back.

777
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,460
Peem, you’re back?

778
00:48:47,030 --> 00:48:48,100
Do you need my help?

779
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:49,810
No. You’ve just returned from the camp.

780
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:50,730
Take some rest.

781
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:52,990
You can head home now.

782
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:53,820
I’ll do some work.

783
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:56,440
Auntie, let me help.

784
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:57,830
You don’t need to.

785
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:58,800
Aunt Pui, hello.

786
00:48:58,840 --> 00:48:59,800
Hi, Phum.

787
00:49:00,350 --> 00:49:01,400
Can I help with anything?

788
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:02,550
No. You don’t have to help.

789
00:49:02,590 --> 00:49:03,200
It’s alright.

790
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:05,100
Since I’m already here, let me help.

791
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:06,210
Which table is this order for?

792
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,190
Table 8.

793
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:09,260
Go ahead.

794
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:23,760
A moment, please.

795
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:26,440
Can you pass me the cleaning cloth, please?

796
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:27,520
Table 7.

797
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,900
Auntie, may I use the restroom, please?

798
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:51,110
The cafe’s are all full.

799
00:49:51,150 --> 00:49:52,590
You can use the one in Peem’s bedroom.

800
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:53,450
Right?

801
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,670
(Please buy them, bro.)

802
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,670
(You can buy them for someone else.)

803
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:23,320
(Give them to your boyfriend.)

804
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:25,590
What are you doing here?

805
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:26,540
It’s taking you so long.

806
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:31,820
Why are you smiling?

807
00:50:35,010 --> 00:50:36,330
You’re still keeping them?

808
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:41,370
I just forgot to throw them away.

809
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:42,420
I’ll throw them away soon.

810
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:43,140
Why?

811
00:50:47,590 --> 00:50:48,070
Let’s go.

812
00:50:48,110 --> 00:50:48,640
Head back already.

813
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:49,300
Where to?

814
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:49,740
Hang on.

815
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:50,320
Let’s go.

816
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:53,900
Hey.

817
00:50:56,310 --> 00:50:57,960
What the heck did you do?

818
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:05,080
You finished it already.

819
00:51:08,250 --> 00:51:11,820
Or did you tell me you haven’t finished it

820
00:51:14,090 --> 00:51:15,860
because you want to have me around?

821
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:18,380
You didn’t agree to cancel our deal either.

822
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,040
Do you like me?

823
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:35,640
Nonsense.

824
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:37,650
I haven’t finished it.

825
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:40,000
It’s an art work, so it needs a lot of details.

826
00:51:40,050 --> 00:51:41,460
Someone like you won’t understand this.

827
00:51:41,550 --> 00:51:44,940
Don’t worry about the deal.

828
00:51:44,990 --> 00:51:46,940
I always keep my word.

829
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:52,880
You really don’t like me?

830
00:52:01,470 --> 00:52:02,570
I don’t know.

831
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:03,530
You don’t know about what?

832
00:52:06,870 --> 00:52:07,810
You really don’t know?

833
00:52:27,930 --> 00:52:29,970
Do you somehow know it now?

834
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:33,320
How about you?

835
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:34,600
Do you somehow know it too?

836
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:00,760
Are you ready to listen to my answer now?

837
00:53:02,690 --> 00:53:03,810
Let’s go.

838
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:04,590
Let’s go already.

839
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:36,770
Cheers.

840
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:42,260
Peem, I like you.

841
00:53:42,290 --> 00:53:43,620
Since you like me,

842
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:44,630
then…

843
00:53:45,310 --> 00:53:46,050
Huh?!

844
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:46,600
Huh?!

845
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:50,830
What are you doing?

846
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:51,960
Phum.

847
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:57,610
You’re still using it?

848
00:53:57,650 --> 00:53:58,580
My grandpa gave it to me.

849
00:53:58,600 --> 00:53:59,380
How nice.

850
00:54:00,130 --> 00:54:00,700
It’s nice.

851
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:02,840
It’s nice because I picked it up for you?

852
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:04,900
It’s nice you picked it up for me,

853
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:06,560
and it’s also nice having you here.
