hold pinkies.

Q.

00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:53,410
What’s up with this?

40
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,470
You suddenly took me to a meal.

41
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,470
Weird.

42
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,490
Eat quickly. I’ve got a class after this.

43
00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:00,890
I also do.

44
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:10,509
What?

45
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:15,930
What is freaking wrong with Toey?

46
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:16,620
Damn it.

47
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:17,610
Shit.

48
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,210
Asshole.

49
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:22,410
Not now.

50
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,530
Get out of here.

DIRECTED BY SIWAJ SAWATMANEEKUL

52
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,660
So, how was it, Toey?

53
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,160
You had a meal with him.

54
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,390
I don’t know.

55
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,850
Hi, friends.

56
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,170
Babe, sit here.

57
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:06,650
Why are you bringing so many people to my place?

58
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,540
Come on, Peem, my friend.

59
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,630
They’re your acquaintances.

60
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:13,180
This is Khaofang, my dearest babe.

61
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,110
That’s Beer and Mick.

62
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,510
They know Toey.

63
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:17,850
With more people,

64
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,560
we can help brainstorm various ideas, you know.

65
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,010
Phum already told me about it.

66
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,900
Don’t make that sad puppy face.

67
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:26,900
Do you want me to punch him for you?

68
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:29,390
Babe.

69
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,260
My babe, relax.

70
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,010
Q is my friend, too.

71
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,440
So, how has the situation been going?

72
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,380
Well, it’s okay, I guess.

73
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:45,210
Really?

74
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,409
Actually, Q told me he has good feelings for Toey.

75
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:51,220
He did?

76
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:53,560
Well, yes.

77
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:57,700
If Q likes Toey, and Toey likes Q,

78
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,450
why not just date already?

79
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:00,880
Come on, Mick.

80
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:02,540
It’s not that simple.

81
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,210
Right.

82
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,590
That sounded like a piece of cake or something.

83
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,510
Honestly,

84
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,980
I think it’s good Q found out about this

85
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,780
because we should strike while the iron is hot.

86
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:18,520
I’ll make a move on Q!

87
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:20,030
Huh?

88
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:20,960
Huh?

89
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:24,260
My friend, you must be out of your mind already.

90
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,860
You were still crying the other day.

91
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,470
Before this, I didn’t know how Q felt about me,

92
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,610
but you said he also has feelings for me, right?

93
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,220
He said he felt comfortable around you.

94
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:38,300
So, what are you going to do next?

95
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,580
I’ll keep fighting

96
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,220
because no matter Milk Frappe Boy and Toey,

97
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:44,010
Q has feelings for him.

98
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,340
So, I’m not afraid of anything anymore.

99
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:47,650
That’s the spirit, my dear bro.

100
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,420
So, let’s stick to the original plan, then.

101
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:50,140
Huh?

102
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,050
Q already knows I pretended to hit on Toey.

103
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,600
How could we stick to the original plan?

104
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,770
So Q will finally realize his feelings.

105
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,610
I think he has already realized it.

106
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,470
But what we should worry about or figure out is

107
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,300
whether Q will admit how he feels. That’s the point.

108
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,110
Honestly, I think we don’t need a plan anymore.

109
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:13,710
You just have to talk it over with him directly.

110
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,780
But give him some time first.

111
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,640
Don’t talk to him now.

112
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:16,280
No way.

113
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,520
I’ve been in pain for several years already, Peem.

114
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:22,200
I won’t waste another second.

115
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,760
What has gotten into you, Toey?

116
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:25,560
That’s my bro.

117
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,110
If Q doesn’t like talking nicely,

118
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:32,210
I’ll show him the real deal.

119
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:33,430
You’re the real deal, buddy.

120
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,510
Make him realize he’s messing with the wrong person.

121
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,280
Add some villain energy into yourself.

122
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:41,740
You must win.

123
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:42,820
He will be yours.

124
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,120
Add that energy.

125
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,390
You said you would make a move on Q.

126
00:06:53,409 --> 00:06:54,170
What do you mean?

127
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,070
I’ll remain his mentee

128
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:01,290
and show him how I feel.

129
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,010
Are you sure?

130
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,930
Peem, you don’t believe I can do it?

131
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:08,610
I’ll wait and see, then.

132
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:10,010
Wait and see.

133
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:21,050
Peem, I’ll show you.

134
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:24,780
Q.

135
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,580
Well, what are you doing?

136
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:32,920
Working, obviously.

137
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:33,840
What do you want?

138
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:39,110
Nothing.

139
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,370
You said you weren't scared of him anymore, didn’t you?

140
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,970
You said it yourself that you'd show him the real deal.

141
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:55,510
Peem, Q is mean.

142
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:00,610
You said he has feelings for me too, didn’t you?

143
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,170
Did you lie to me?

144
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,780
I didn’t.

145
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:06,820
I told you already to give him some time.

146
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:11,020
What should I do then?

147
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:14,810
First of all, let go of my arm.

148
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:22,780
I told you already you’d need our help.

149
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,250
[Our target isn’t yielding at all.]
[What should we do?]

150
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:33,210
[You’re asking the right person.]
[I’ll drop by this evening with a surprise.]

151
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,980
Can we really believe Pun?

152
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:37,510
Trust me.

153
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:38,919
Let’s wait and see.

154
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,200
How savage this guy is.

155
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,010
Why did he ask us to come here?

156
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:58,900
No clue.

157
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:00,370
He said he’s bringing a surprise.

158
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,360
He kept us waiting too long.

159
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,360
If he doesn’t show up soon, I’m leaving.

160
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:04,310
Hey, hold on.

161
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,570
He’s arriving soon.

162
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:06,260
Just wait a bit.

163
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,430
My friends, I’m here.

164
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:13,540
It took you ages.

165
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,480
What’s up?

166
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:15,840
I have good news to announce.

167
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:19,100
Well, what is it?

168
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,410
Why do I strangely have a bad feeling about this?

169
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:24,690
You’re all going to Kanchanaburi.

170
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,380
We’re going to a volunteer camp!

171
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,620
Huh?

172
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:29,360
Are you happy?

173
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,740
Not even a little.

174
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:31,780
So this is your surprise?

175
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:32,820
Yeah.

176
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:33,710
Come on.

177
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:36,360
I thought it’s something about Q and Toey.

178
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,020
Peem!

179
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:40,420
Huh? What?

180
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:41,550
Me? Why?

181
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:47,380
Q and Toey are mentor and mentee.

182
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,060
Right?

183
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:49,990
Yep.

184
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,480
Yep.

185
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,120
Right. That’s what he was getting at.

186
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:56,920
I’m not going.

187
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,860
I’m sorry but,

188
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,410
I’ve already signed us all up.

189
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,180
The professor also approved it already.

190
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:03,010
I’m the camp president this time.

191
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:06,410
So, what do we have to do?

192
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:08,680
Activities at school.

193
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:11,590
Read to kids and fix some stuff.

194
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,070
But now we still need more volunteers.

195
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,310
We need to recruit more people.

196
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,940
Stick these posters up around your faculties

197
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,820
to get more people to join us.

198
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,310
So, what do you say?

199
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:24,440
Do I have any choice?

200
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,380
I’m going to the Dentistry Faculty.

201
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:27,730
Come with me, Pun.

202
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:29,030
Sure, buddy.

203
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,620
I’ll handle Engineering.

204
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:32,110
Peem.

205
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:32,750
Huh?

206
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:33,520
Come with me.

207
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:36,710
You take them to your faculty with Toey.

208
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:39,390
Matt.

209
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,520
Yes, bro.

210
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,460
Where do you want me to stick it?

211
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:43,010
For the drink…

212
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,490
- Stick it on the drink?
- Pay for us.

213
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,040
Huh?

214
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,220
We don’t have any cash now.

215
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:47,270
Cover it for us.

216
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:47,930
Let’s go.

217
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:48,970
See you later.

218
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:49,990
I’ll pay you back later.

219
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:50,800
Peem, hurry up.

220
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:51,910
Alright. Wait a second.

221
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:52,780
Pay for mine, too.

222
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,290
Q, won’t you wait for Toey?

223
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:55,730
Do I have to pay for yours too?

224
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:57,220
Eh?

225
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:04,720
Money?

226
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:41,160
What’s wrong with you?

227
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:43,480
You were mad,

228
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:44,520
then avoided me

229
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,890
and then took me to a meal.

230
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:49,050
I can’t keep up with your moods.

231
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,750
You’ve been so up and down.

232
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:53,610
I’m not mad.

233
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:00,150
You’re not?

234
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,500
Can you act normally then?

235
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,150
Do you feel that uncomfortable when I’m around?

236
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:32,210
What do you mean by normal?

237
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,410
Just not like this.

238
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:56,380
You mean…like this?

239
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,210
You want it this way, right?

240
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:03,130
Stop.

241
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:06,880
We aren’t in the same league, Toey.

242
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:09,810
Q.

243
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:11,970
Q.

244
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:17,550
Why did you make me come with you?

245
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,210
So Q and Toey can get to talk.

246
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:22,500
Is it a good idea to leave them alone together?

247
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,110
This morning, Q still ignored Toey.

248
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:25,690
Come on.

249
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,340
I’m sure Toey can handle it.

250
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,450
But let’s get to work.

251
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,100
Take it.

252
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,430
Hurry up and stick it.

253
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:35,900
Why are we sticking so many?

254
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:36,650
Come on.

255
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,350
Just do it. Stop complaining.

256
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,210
What are you guys doing?

257
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,100
Hey.

258
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,500
We’re putting up posters to recruit more people to join our camp.

259
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,710
What camp?

260
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:44,820
Volunteer camp?

261
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:45,770
Yep.

262
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,710
Join us.

263
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,620
Invite Fang too.

264
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:51,910
Invite him yourself.

265
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,320
But someone like Fang won’t go.

266
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,010
Really?

267
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,810
But if he joins,

268
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:02,510
it will be our first time

269
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,710
on a trip to another province together.

270
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,350
Peem.

271
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:11,980
Huh?

272
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:12,890
Let’s head to the Architecture Faculty.

273
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:13,430
Huh?

274
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:15,170
We’ve stuck enough posters here.

275
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,780
Also, we’ve got three more members already.

276
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,110
If you aren’t going, I’m leaving first.

277
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:24,460
I’ll go with you.

278
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:26,960
You aren’t eating with us?

279
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:27,830
You two go ahead.

280
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:32,880
What are you looking at? Let’s go.

281
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:33,920
Let’s eat.

282
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:35,720
Yeah.

283
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,520
Hey, since you have Phum here helping you,

284
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,060
take care of this for me.

285
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:49,840
I’ll be on a love mission now, buddy.

286
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:50,740
Bye-bye.

287
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:51,770
Tan!

288
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:56,560
You left me just like this?

289
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:02,230
You want to help me that much, right?

290
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,510
- Take them.
- All of them?

291
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:05,840
Go. Put them up.

292
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:15,780
Fang.

293
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:16,920
Peek-a-boo.

294
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:18,990
Why did you suddenly show up? What’s up?

295
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:21,200
Let’s go to the volunteer camp.

296
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,730
Nope.

297
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:23,360
I’m lazy.

298
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,060
Come on.

299
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,410
But I’m going upcountry

300
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,610
and spending nights there.

301
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:32,620
Can you stand not having me around?

302
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:36,210
Is it you or I who can’t stand it?

303
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,010
It’s me, of course.

304
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,180
Come with me.

305
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,510
- Please. Please.
- No.

306
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:45,580
Come on.

307
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:46,780
Come with me. Please.

308
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,450
I’m not going.

309
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,790
You’re going. You’re going.

310
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:49,440
Say, I’m going.

311
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:50,380
You’re going.

312
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,210
You’re going.

313
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,210
I’m not going. I’m lazy.

314
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,220
I can’t stand being without you.

315
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,760
Come with me, okay? Please.

316
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:58,870
Fine. I’ll go.

317
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,590
Let go already. I’m working.

318
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:07,410
Whose boyfriend is this?

319
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:09,410
He’s super cute.

320
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,950
Damn it, Tan.

321
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,170
You left me alone again.

322
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,870
Why are you going to the camp?

323
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:28,660
It’s Pun’s idea.

324
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,180
He wants Q and Toey to spend time together.

325
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,520
He didn’t ask if we wanted to go or not, though.

326
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:34,620
Let’s talk about you, then.

327
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,350
Someone like you joining a camp?

328
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:38,380
It won’t be comfortable, you know.

329
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:39,790
Why?

330
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,720
Do you think I can’t stand it?

331
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:43,120
I don’t know.

332
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,310
Are you heading home?

333
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:05,890
I want to take some pictures around.

334
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,300
Come with me.

335
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:09,369
Where?

336
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,369
Nearby your place.

337
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:14,109
Alright.

338
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:30,770
[Volunteer Camp Project]
[Book Donation]

339
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,760
Hey, I want to ride a bicycle.

340
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,570
You know how to?

341
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,920
You’re underestimating my skill again.

342
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,090
Follow me.

343
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,330
Hello.

344
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,640
I want to rent a bicycle, please.

345
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,390
Sure.

346
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:01,800
Ride well. Don’t let me fall off.

347
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,060
Hey.

348
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,510
What’s with you?

349
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:12,670
If you don’t want to fall, hold me tightly.

350
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,280
Are you ready?

351
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:38,610
There’s one spot where I want to take some pictures.

352
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:40,560
Really?

353
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:41,820
We’re almost there.

354
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:46,870
I’ll take some pictures around.

355
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:47,810
Just a minute.

356
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,010
You like taking pictures?

357
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,410
Uh-huh.

358
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:09,260
I feel taking pictures can capture good moments.

359
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:11,850
What did you just do?

360
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,110
Took a picture of you.

361
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,200
Why did you secretly do that?

362
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:17,840
I want to keep this moment.

363
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:22,940
Give it to me.

364
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:24,230
- What are you doing, huh?
- Give it to me.

365
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:24,820
Hand it to me.

366
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,310
Why?

367
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,170
Hand it to me.

368
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,210
You don’t like your picture taken?

369
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:29,370
It’s not like that.

370
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,930
But you secretly took it.

371
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,470
I don’t know if I look awkward in the picture or not.

372
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:34,610
Nope.

373
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,410
You look adorable.

374
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,270
Well, do you want to give it a try?

375
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,200
I’ll take a picture of you then.

376
00:19:57,690 --> 00:19:58,350
Why?

377
00:19:58,550 --> 00:19:59,370
To get back at me?

378
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:00,710
Nope.

379
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:02,210
You enjoy taking pictures, don’t you?

380
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,070
Those who enjoy taking pictures usually don’t have photos of themselves.

381
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:07,410
Give it a try.

382
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:16,580
How is it?

383
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:17,400
Handsome?

384
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,110
So-so.

385
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:22,350
So-so?

386
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:25,810
Let’s take a look again.

387
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:39,970
It’s still so-so.

388
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,610
So-so?

389
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,810
How about having a proper look?

390
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,910
Well, I’m leaving.

391
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:53,910
Where?

392
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,420
I’m heading home.

393
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:57,810
My camera?

394
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,560
If you want it, come get it yourself.

395
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,310
Do you remember me?

396
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:41,100
I hit your head the other day.

397
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:42,640
I see.

398
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,020
I remember you.

399
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,330
That was quite a knock, though.

400
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,150
I still couldn’t forget it.

401
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:48,510
What are you doing here?

402
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:49,780
Asking me to pay back for the drink?

403
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,240
Nope.

404
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,460
I’m applying for this camp.

405
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,100
Seriously?

406
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:00,400
I’m Kluen, third year.

407
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,800
I’m Peem, third year also.

408
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,570
Why are you joining this camp?

409
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:08,370
I think it looks fun.

410
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:09,460
How about you?

411
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,700
Do you see that guy?

412
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,820
He’s the camp president,

413
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,420
who forced all of us to join.

414
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,110
You’re here alone?

415
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:18,620
Yep.

416
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,710
I also invited my friends,

417
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:21,660
but they didn’t come.

418
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:22,920
I’m kind of lonely here.

419
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,780
Lucky enough, I still know you.

420
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,220
Don’t worry.

421
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:27,970
Tons of my friends are here.

422
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,320
Guys.

423
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:32,400
This is my friend, Kluen.

424
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,340
He’s coming solo.

425
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,300
He’ll be joining us.

426
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:35,180
Phum.

427
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:36,310
Beer.

428
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:37,410
Mick.

429
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:38,690
Q.

430
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,580
Fang.

431
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:40,670
Tan.

432
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,320
Chain.

433
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:44,110
Those two boys are second years, Toey and Matthew.

434
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,990
Honestly, I can’t remember their names.

435
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:47,800
What?

436
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,240
But I’ll try to remember them one by one.

437
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:51,460
Fair enough.

438
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,510
We can talk then.

439
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:53,770
Which faculty are you in?

440
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:54,970
Architecture.

441
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:58,620
Babe, he’s from your faculty.

442
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,040
Do you know him?

443
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:02,920
Are you sure?

444
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:04,520
Probably your boyfriend skipped class?

445
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,770
Don’t be surprised.

446
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:07,320
Hey. Don’t insult my boyfriend. He did attend.

447
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:08,690
It’s just that he slept in class.

448
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,610
I’m kidding.

449
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:12,670
Hello, Kluen.

450
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,330
Hello, everyone.

451
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:18,320
This is our volunteer camp’s first meet.

452
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,180
I’m Pun, third year from Political Science.

453
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,420
I’m the camp president.

454
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,380
This feels so weird.

455
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,780
I’m not used to seeing this version of him, really.

456
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,510
He can handle something formal, too, huh?

457
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:33,790
Did someone swallow him?

458
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:34,780
I’m curious too.

459
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:36,450
I think someone swallowed him whole.

460
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,190
Huh?

461
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,410
What?

462
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:42,120
We’ll divide our responsibilities later.

463
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:44,920
But this evening, we’ll open for book donation.

464
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:46,670
If you’re free, join me.

465
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,270
I’m not going.

466
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:53,420
I’ve got work to wrap up.

467
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:54,490
I’ll accompany you, Fang.

468
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:57,110
You two are glued together, aren’t you?

469
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:58,420
Exactly.

470
00:23:58,610 --> 00:23:59,660
Can’t even be separated?

471
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,510
Sure thing.

472
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,610
Q, are you going?

473
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:05,980
Beer and I already committed.

474
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,780
We’re playing music there.

475
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:08,810
How about you?

476
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:10,510
Are you going?

477
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:11,970
I don’t think so.

478
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,320
I have to handle stuff at the faculty.

479
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:15,580
Architecture students are swamped with more assignments than us, huh?

480
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,020
Since we’re playing music,

481
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:18,920
should I prepare to dance?

482
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:21,010
If you think you can dance, just go ahead.

483
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,180
Mick, you said you’d dance, didn’t you?

484
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,170
♪ Come on, come row ♪

485
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,850
♪ Water runs deep, let’s keep the flow ♪

486
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,040
♪ Come on, come row ♪

487
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,240
♪ Water runs deep, let’s keep the flow ♪

488
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,020
Hello, everyone.

489
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,510
We’re from the volunteer camp.

490
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:33,640
We’re going to Kanchanaburi.

491
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,770
You can drop off your books here for donation.

492
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:37,180
But if you don’t have any to donate,

493
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,690
feel free to listen to lovely music here.

494
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,350
Let’s go.

495
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:21,520
Why didn’t you go with your friends?

496
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:22,880
Why are you here watching me?

497
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:25,810
I want to be with you more.

498
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:29,090
Being with me is super boring.

499
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:30,360
How?

500
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,080
Sitting here and watching you work is relaxing.

501
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:36,320
It’s up to you, then.

502
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,070
Cute.

503
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:49,810
I’m talking about you.

504
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:54,310
Help me then.

505
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,220
Nope.

506
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:59,410
Today, I’m just here to watch.

507
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,700
So you aren’t helping?

508
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:04,340
Okay.

509
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:19,230
I didn’t expect we’d get this many books.

510
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,170
That’s right.

511
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,180
Let’s do it again next time, shall we?

512
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,450
I had so much fun today.

513
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,530
You had fun for sure.

514
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,620
I saw you dance the whole time.

515
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:26,510
That’s because you guys played music well.

516
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:27,760
How could I not dance?

517
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,370
Honestly, I’m a genius for choosing you guys to handle the music.

518
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,380
That’s more likely because you don’t know anyone else.

519
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:33,680
Come on.

520
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:36,320
Matt, is it heavy?

521
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,510
- You’re walking comfortably, carrying nothing.
- Did you enjoy it?

522
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,590
Yeah. It was fun.

523
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:53,070
It’s super heavy.

524
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:56,290
Hey, thanks a lot for today, guys.

525
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,340
Safe trip home.

526
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:58,780
See you later.

527
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,590
See you.

528
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:00,910
- Bye.
- See you.

529
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,020
Why did you come home?

530
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:23,240
I have something to talk to you about.

531
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,380
What is it?

532
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:29,730
Let me ask you a question.

533
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:32,380
Why do you like Tan?

534
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,100
Strange.

535
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,180
I’m just curious.

536
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:39,710
It seems like you usually don't pay much attention to him.

537
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,610
Are you expecting a serious answer?

538
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:43,650
Yep.

539
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:47,610
Well,

540
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:53,150
liking someone doesn’t need a lot of reasons.

541
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:55,710
He’s cute.

542
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:58,710
He’s funny.

543
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:02,900
When I’m with him, I feel at ease.

544
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,010
Especially when I’m stressed because of work,

545
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:09,400
he can help lighten my mood.

546
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:14,890
Good boy.

547
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,120
I’m not your dog.

548
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,110
Hey.

549
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:38,320
Hey.

550
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:39,790
Are you listening?

551
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:46,210
You’re head over heels in love with him, bro.

552
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:48,510
Keep this between us.

553
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,310
Don’t tell him.

554
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,520
By the way,

555
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:57,410
can you tell me already why you asked?

556
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,870
Nothing much.

557
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,510
I’ll take a shower. I’m exhausted today.

558
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:10,010
I bet you’ve already found that person too, right?

559
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:11,570
I heard what you said.

560
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:17,300
Pun is dropping by, right?

561
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:19,090
He said he would make a camp banner,

562
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:21,010
asking me to prepare some colors.

563
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,500
We also need to help him.

564
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,460
A camp banner?

565
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,200
Yeah.

566
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:28,300
We’ll use it during the opening ceremony.

567
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,140
Why didn’t he order one properly?

568
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:35,230
Why do we need to make it ourselves?

569
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,110
He thinks

570
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:41,260
making the camp banner ourselves will get us into the real camp spirit.

571
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:44,300
It’s a camp banner.

572
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:45,720
It isn’t for a sports day.

573
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,780
I can’t stop him, you know.

574
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:47,860
Who can?

575
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:52,620
Chain.

576
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:54,850
Huh?

577
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:01,080
You guys are making work for yourselves.

578
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,440
What do you mean?

579
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,270
We’re going to a volunteer camp,

580
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,250
so this is what we should do.

581
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,070
Exactly.

582
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,180
Since you’re studying Fine Arts,

583
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:08,490
you’ll paint on this canvas.

584
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,540
I’ve drafted some wording here.

585
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:13,180
Tan and I will make the name tags.

586
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:14,910
How about Chain?

587
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,510
He’s got class.

588
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,690
Why do our tasks seem so uneven, huh?

589
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:22,560
He’s getting on your nerves.

590
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,880
Making name tags is difficult. Right?

591
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:25,100
True.

592
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,110
How?

593
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:28,260
Well,

594
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:31,650
it requires my delicate handwriting, bros.

595
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,370
Why are you faking a handsome voice?

596
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,220
I’m cool.

597
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:37,650
- Go ahead. Do your best, guys.
- Take your colors.

598
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:38,320
I’m off to class.

599
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:39,910
See you.

600
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,180
Toey, help us.

601
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,010
What’s up?

602
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:44,880
Help with what?

603
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,160
Peem.

604
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:52,350
- What?
- Peem.

605
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:56,440
For what?

606
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,680
Hey, are you getting back at me?

607
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:00,160
You want this, right?

608
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:07,800
What?

609
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:08,380
Hey?

610
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,910
Slightly.

611
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,570
Pun, I started to believe you now.

612
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,030
Guys, you’re in for it.

613
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:16,780
Peem!

614
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:19,570
Why are you doing this to me?

615
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:23,930
Come!

616
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:25,300
No way!

617
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,760
He’s passing out.

618
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:56,740
Pun, wash yours.

619
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,240
Pun!

620
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:00,900
You want to play, huh?

621
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:04,320
You’re playing like a kid. Stop.

622
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,250
My whole face.

623
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:12,400
Q.

624
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,890
Peem, you feel hot?

625
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,890
Guys, Peem feels hot.

626
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,960
Look. I’m stained.

627
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,620
That’s just a bit.

628
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:28,310
- Look at my tee.
- Why does it feel so cold?

629
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:29,220
Pun.

630
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,220
Thank you.

631
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:41,800
Why are you laughing?

632
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:43,460
Nothing.

633
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,600
I was just thinking about funny stuff.

634
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,860
You aren’t laughing at my face, right?

635
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:48,340
What’s that funny stuff?

636
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:51,410
Look at us.

637
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,060
We’re third-year students already, but here we are playing with water.

638
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:54,990
Crazy.

639
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:56,020
I didn’t play.

640
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,260
I didn’t get wet at all.

641
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,700
I didn’t mean it as an insult, you know.

642
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,250
I just like it.

643
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:05,000
I feel at ease being with you guys.

644
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:07,770
I can do whatever I want.

645
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,770
I can be silly if I want to.

646
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:11,220
I can act like a kid if I want to.

647
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:14,290
Ptooey.

648
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,260
Enough.

649
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:15,810
That sounds cheesy.

650
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:16,720
I’ll splash more water on you.

651
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,140
A little pat on your shoulder.

652
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,740
A little pat on your head.

653
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:25,630
I’ll give you an extra.

654
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:28,300
Is there something in your water?

655
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:30,800
I’m curious too. Why does my head feel hurt after drinking it?

656
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:31,700
I’ll try.

657
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,340
Go ahead.

658
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:37,020
That’s so hard, Peem.

659
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,410
Hey, your face looks so hilarious.

660
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:48,060
Q, bring it down a notch.

661
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,610
How nice.

662
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,570
When you guys are together, you look so happy.

663
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:55,010
Absolutely, bro.

664
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:56,310
Look that way.

665
00:33:58,510 --> 00:33:59,820
But I haven’t drunk it yet.

666
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:01,490
It’s the happiness we’re offering you.

667
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,810
Tan.

668
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:20,139
I’ve assigned you all as heads of each department.

669
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:23,409
We’re both studying Fine Arts, but why are our duties so different?

670
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,750
Why does Peem get to teach the kids,

671
00:34:25,969 --> 00:34:27,969
while I get to paint the wall?

672
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:30,050
I think

673
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,969
Pun is afraid you’ll make the kids cry.

674
00:34:32,409 --> 00:34:33,320
You’ve gone too far.

675
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,420
You'll be the first kid to cry then.

676
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,420
I’m not a kid anymore.

677
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,940
Hey. I’m staying out of this.

678
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,860
Why are Mick and you on the cooking team?

679
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,600
That’s because of my excellent cooking skill.

680
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,310
You just threw water spinach into the pan the other day.

681
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,449
And the oil splashed on me.

682
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:54,690
We’ll have some food to eat, right?

683
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:55,870
Delicious one.

684
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,370
Don’t you worry, Peem.

685
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:00,620
With me and my beloved Fang,

686
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,920
I guarantee you'll be full.

687
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,980
I’ll just get desserts instead of food for sure.

688
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,610
No sugar needed.

689
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:10,490
Well, that’s it.

690
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,910
Let’s get to work.

691
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,030
Let’s go.

692
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:15,430
Cooking team, let’s go.

693
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:18,690
What? Are you cooking now?

694
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:19,530
We’re practicing.

695
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,700
We’re preparing ahead, you know.

696
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,120
Should we buy cheap or expensive ones?

697
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,570
Any will do.

698
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:34,070
Just get good quality.

699
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,430
Take as many as you want.

700
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,550
I’ll take 10 then.

701
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,460
Sure.

702
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,970
Even if you want to buy everything in this store, I can pay for you.

703
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,720
Excuse me, I’ll take everything.

704
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:51,130
Which color should we go with?

705
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:51,700
This one.

706
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,030
How about earth-tone colors?

707
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:53,870
That’s right.

708
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,340
Q.

709
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:11,370
Toey, what are you playing at?

710
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,810
You’re bothering the shop owner.

711
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:22,460
Fang, don’t. Don’t do this.

712
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:24,210
I’ll carry it for you.

713
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,300
I’ll push the cart for you.

714
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:27,590
What are we getting?

715
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,490
I’ll get it for you.

716
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,860
Fang, are you tired?

717
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:31,650
Let me do it.

718
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:35,540
This one?

719
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:37,180
The one on top.

720
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,330
Over there.

721
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:51,370
Enough.

722
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:54,410
Whoa. Time flies so fast.

723
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:55,900
We’re going to the camp tomorrow.

724
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,770
I feel like

725
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:03,810
Pun just twisted my arm to go only yesterday.

726
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:06,850
Damn it.

727
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,700
Anyway.

728
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,500
Let’s grab something to eat.

729
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:13,310
I’m not available.

730
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,340
See you.

731
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,760
Fine. I’m leaving.

732
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:34,850
I’m hungry.

733
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:36,220
Let’s grab something to eat.

734
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:39,270
Don’t you have other friends?

735
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:41,970
I do, but I want to eat with you.

736
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:01,980
Hello? What’s up?

737
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,000
(Are you free now?)

738
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:04,610
(Help me with something.)

739
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,320
Yeah. What do you want me to do?

740
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:11,470
(Meet me at the Student Society's Office.)

741
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:13,310
Alright. I’ll hurry there.

742
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,100
I’m not free.

743
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,180
I’ll get going.

744
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:17,370
Where are you going?

745
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:18,410
I’m going with you.

746
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:27,980
Head home already.

747
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,100
I told you I’m not free.

748
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:33,170
Phum, you’re here too?

749
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:35,210
Nice. I’m looking for someone to help.

750
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:37,180
Alright. Should we get in now?

751
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:37,910
Let’s go.

752
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:42,310
I’m working on it alone.

753
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,610
Help me organize these books for the volunteer camp.

754
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,850
There are tons.

755
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:50,810
I called others, but none of them answered.

756
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,180
I can’t handle it alone.

757
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,410
Don’t worry.

758
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:54,730
Just put them in the boxes, right?

759
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:55,600
Uh-huh.

760
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:57,010
I’ve already sorted them.

761
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:57,840
You just need to put them in the boxes.

762
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,410
What’s your plan after this?

763
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,310
We haven’t eaten anything yet.

764
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,770
I’ll buy some food for you, then.

765
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:08,340
Wait here.

766
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:09,200
It won’t take long. I’ll be right back.

767
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,540
I’ll choose the dish for you.

768
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,260
Okay?

769
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:40,370
Thanks a lot.

770
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:46,830
What’s up?

771
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,380
The professor asked for me urgently.

772
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:52,900
I’m sorry,

773
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,350
but can you handle this for me first?

774
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,310
I’ll hurry back.

775
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:57,050
Sure thing.

776
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,320
It’s no big deal.

777
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:00,310
Right?

778
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:03,810
Yeah.

779
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:05,910
Do what you need to.

780
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:07,230
Thanks, buddy.

781
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,010
I’ll be right back.

782
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:11,340
Come. Let’s eat.

783
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:28,780
You don’t like the leaf parts?

784
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,020
Fang doesn’t either.

785
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:35,720
I don’t like the stems.

786
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:37,610
Let’s exchange, shall we?

787
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:12,130
By the way,

788
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:15,050
when I told you I had fun when I was with you guys,

789
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:16,920
I meant it.

790
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:20,920
I know.

791
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:22,010
You’ve told me already.

792
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,460
I just want to let you know,

793
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,340
and I hope it will keep going like this.

794
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:35,900
When I’m with you, I don’t have to worry much about things.

795
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:39,050
I get to do what I haven’t tried.

796
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:41,180
I can do whatever I want to.

797
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:49,410
Sure thing.

798
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:50,910
I’m your slave.

799
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:53,710
That’s not what I mean.

800
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,670
I know. I’m kidding.

801
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:00,210
That sounds like you’re confessing to me.

802
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:05,980
Maybe I am.

803
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:16,210
What did you say?

804
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,120
Nothing.

805
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,170
Keep eating.

806
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:41,260
Why do you keep looking at me?

807
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:41,980
Eat already.

808
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:55,620
[For Donation]

809
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:56,660
Let’s go home.
[For Donation]

810
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:57,090
[For Donation]

811
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,050
How about Pun?

812
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:00,710
Don’t worry.

813
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,000
I’ll text him.

814
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:02,860
I’ll give you a ride.

815
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:05,910
Passing through that way again?

816
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:07,370
I can pass through that way every day.

817
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,210
Head home quickly.

818
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,780
I’ll pack my luggage.

819
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:29,620
I haven’t started yet.

820
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:33,410
If I call you, answer it.

821
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:37,550
Just talk right here.

822
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,230
Pick up my call.

823
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:41,100
I want to talk to you.

824
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:39,400
He was just saying that.

825
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:58,210
[Pun]

826
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:07,180
What’s up?

827
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:08,920
(Sorry, Peem.)

828
00:45:08,950 --> 00:45:10,920
(I talked to the professor for so long.)

829
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:12,910
(Thanks a lot for helping.)

830
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:13,840
No worries.

831
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:14,870
Go to bed early

832
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:16,010
so you won’t feel tired tomorrow.

833
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:18,120
(Okay. I’m hanging up now.)

834
00:45:19,270 --> 00:45:19,910
See you.

835
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:31,980
What’s with you?

836
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,010
You aren’t calling, right?

837
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:40,720
Why haven’t you called?

838
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:50,810
Hello? Why are you calling me?

839
00:45:50,830 --> 00:45:51,580
I’m heading to bed.

840
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:53,320
Are you sure?

841
00:45:53,610 --> 00:45:54,940
You’ve been waiting for my call, haven’t you?

842
00:45:55,390 --> 00:45:58,010
Me? I’m going to bed.

843
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:00,200
So how is it going?

844
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:01,620
Have you done packing already?

845
00:46:02,070 --> 00:46:02,820
(Yep.)

846
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:04,060
(So, what’s up?)

847
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:05,430
(Why are you video-calling me?)

848
00:46:06,050 --> 00:46:06,930
Nothing.

849
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:08,810
I just want to see your face.

850
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:13,910
That’s it?

851
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:15,170
I’ll hang up then.

852
00:46:15,310 --> 00:46:16,010
Hey, hold on.

853
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:18,820
Well, I’m packing my luggage now.

854
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:20,710
I want to ask what you’re bringing.

855
00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:22,780
Just pack like for any trip.

856
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:23,800
It’s similar.

857
00:46:24,370 --> 00:46:26,010
Nope. That won’t work.

858
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:27,990
Your trip and my trip aren’t the same, though.

859
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:33,330
You must bring comfy outfits.

860
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:35,030
Wear something suitable for working on-site.

861
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:36,610
What do you think about this one?

862
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:37,610
Is it okay?

863
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:40,110
Seriously?

864
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:41,980
You’ll be sweating a lot wearing this.

865
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:44,110
So, I can’t bring this one?

866
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:46,110
You can’t, of course. Why did you even ask?

867
00:46:48,130 --> 00:46:49,510
I can’t bring that one.

868
00:46:51,830 --> 00:46:52,790
What do you think about this one?

869
00:46:53,350 --> 00:46:54,210
You need my answer?

870
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:56,620
The left one is okay, but the right one isn’t.

871
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:58,660
Your left or my left?

872
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:02,680
This one is alright.

873
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:03,200
Yep.

874
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:05,510
And these two?

875
00:47:07,660 --> 00:47:09,760
- I think I’ll go with this one.
- I’ll let you figure it out yourself.

876
00:47:10,810 --> 00:47:11,670
You were born in Thailand.

877
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:12,920
Think it over.

878
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:14,790
This one?

879
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,610
I think this one isn’t working.

880
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:20,920
Great job.

881
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:35,050
Eh? You’re sleeping already?

882
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:40,170
Goodnight.

883
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:52,640
Goodnight.

884
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:16,210
So, I’m falling for you already, right?

885
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:19,010
Or am I not?

886
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:25,060
How could I say I’m not?

887
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:26,150
I freaking like you now.
