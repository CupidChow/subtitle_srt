5
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:20,060
What’s that animal?

6
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,550
If you just watch and do nothing,

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,690
someone else might win his heart.

8
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:24,460
Chain.

9
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,130
Hug me.

10
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:27,740
Feel hungry often, then.

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,930
Happy Birthday, Puppy Phum.

12
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:35,600
Thanks a lot, everyone.

13
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,520
Thank you for being born so I could love you.

14
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:41,440
Hopefully, our love lasts longer than the river.

15
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,150
I hope that, from now on, our lives will be full of fun.

16
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:45,760
Let’s go all out.

17
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:01,850
Wow, Toey.

18
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,010
You're so talented.

19
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:06,460
It's been ages and that paper is still blank.

20
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:08,680
I’m drafting it, you know.

21
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:10,120
Oh, I see.

22
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:12,030
Check out this diagram.

23
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,280
To calculate the area of this cylinder,

24
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,440
you need to add x squared to 4y squared.

25
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:18,450
Are you getting it?

26
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:19,710
I’m trying to.

27
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:22,090
Watch this finger.

28
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,479
Hang in there.

29
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,560
Wake up.

30
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:05,070
Exams are finally over!

31
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,430
Finally!

32
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,180
I’m so happy.

33
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,229
Do you throw them like this every time exams are over?

34
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,400
It's my way of de-stressing, you know.

35
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:12,560
Since our exams are over,

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,260
let’s plan a trip.

37
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:16,660
Where should we go?

38
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,840
Somewhere local or abroad?

39
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:18,740
How about Mars?

40
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,530
Why on earth would we go to Mars?

41
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:22,940
Let’s go to Chiang Mai, shall we?

42
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,020
It seems you really like Chiang Mai, huh?

43
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,240
We just got back from there.

44
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,660
We can go there again, can’t we?

45
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:31,900
How about you?

46
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:32,790
Where do you want to go?

47
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,040
I’m good with anything.

48
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:34,970
Let everyone else decide.

49
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:35,960
What about you?

50
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,860
I’ll go wherever you go.

51
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,120
How sweet.

52
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,710
Phum, sugar is expensive these days.

53
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:45,820
Tone it down a bit, okay?

54
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:47,600
Think about a single folk like me too.

55
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,440
Is that so?

56
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,770
Rubbing it in, huh?

57
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:55,560
You guys haven't been to the beach, right?

58
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,310
How about going to the beach?

59
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,220
What do you think?

60
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,820
I agree.

61
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,590
Let’s go to Krabi.

62
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,000
We won’t have to pay for a hotel.

63
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,070
Your dad’s resort, right?

64
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:06,880
Exactly.

65
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,150
Krabi it is, then.

66
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:10,300
Deal?

67
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,250
Okay.

68
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,350
Oho.

69
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,980
Is this your family’s resort?

70
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,950
I hit the jackpot, didn’t I?

71
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:04,240
A gold shop owner's son shouldn’t say that.

72
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,850
Hey, Q.

73
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,940
Hello, Fon.

74
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:08,900
Hello.

75
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:09,600
Hello.

76
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,640
These are my friends.

77
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,730
You all must be tired from traveling.

78
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:13,930
Do you want to go to your rooms now to rest?

79
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:14,600
Yes, please.

80
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,680
- Here are the keys.
- Thank you.

81
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,000
And for the dinner,

82
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,190
For dinner, you can either eat in the dining room

83
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,150
or have it served in your room

84
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:24,200
If you need anything, please let me know.

85
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,750
I’m available to help 24/7.

86
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,980
We can handle that ourselves.

87
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,230
Okay.

88
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,040
Thank you.

89
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,510
- We don’t want to bother you.
- 	Have a good rest.

90
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:34,710
Hold it. That's ours.

91
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:36,400
Yours.

92
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:36,980
Yours.

93
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:37,590
Yeah.

94
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,510
Yours.

95
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,510
Oho. We’ve got separate rooms?

96
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,880
No more sleeping on top of each other like at Peem’s place.

97
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,930
Don’t sleep over at my place again.

98
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,070
I’m kidding.

99
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:46,630
I’m kidding.

100
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:47,110
Sleep outside.

101
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:47,760
Toey, let’s go.

102
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,330
Let’s go to the room.

103
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,690
He’s leading the way.

104
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:52,460
It’s my house and his hotel.

105
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,840
The size can’t even be compared.

106
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,090
The bed size isn’t right, you know.

107
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:05,700
The bed is so soft.

108
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:09,640
What are you doing, Phum?

109
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,180
Let me see.

110
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:19,180
It’s really soft.

111
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:22,360
Phum.

112
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:23,680
Phum.

113
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,600
Phum, stop.

114
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:25,400
Stop, Phum.

115
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,560
Phum.

116
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,240
You’ll pay for this.

117
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,010
I’m not scared.

118
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,350
You said that yourself.

119
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,440
Why? What will you do?

120
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:34,580
You aren’t scared?

121
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:34,930
I’m not.

122
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:35,420
You aren’t?

123
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:35,840
I’m not.

124
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,210
You aren’t scared?

125
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,520
You aren’t scared?

126
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,960
You aren’t scared?

127
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:58,450
Whoa.

128
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:01,530
This is stunning, Q.

129
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,770
Others’ rooms aren’t on the same floor as ours?

130
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,190
This is my room.

131
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,760
It’s not up for reservation.

132
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:20,960
Whoa.

133
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,700
How cool.

134
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:23,330
I want to have one.

135
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:34,840
Having a room and having a boyfriend who owns the room is the same thing, right?

136
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,480
That’s true.

137
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:44,290
Let me peck your cheek.

138
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,550
Super happy.

139
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,060
Peem, let’s play this plate throwing game.

140
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:17,650
Here we go.

141
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:18,960
Do you even know how to throw it?

142
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:19,760
This is how it’s done.

143
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,990
Come, guys.

144
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:24,210
Matt.

145
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,030
Hold on. Don’t throw it yet.

146
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,130
Pun.

147
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,260
Pun.

148
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,120
Guys, let’s take selfies together.

149
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:16,490
Come.

150
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:19,200
Hurry up.

151
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,460
Come.

152
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:23,200
Come.

153
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,960
One, two, three.

154
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:41,960
How lucky I am to have a rich boyfriend.

155
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,260
From now on, I won’t do anything.

156
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:46,020
I’ll just live off you.

157
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:49,790
Why are you teasing me?

158
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,470
You’re always talking nonsense.

159
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,750
You aren’t romantic at all.

160
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:05,430
Come sit.

161
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,830
Look at other couples.

162
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,230
They’re so cute together.

163
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,170
Take Tan-Fang as an example.

164
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,170
Why?

165
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,500
Or do you want me to be like Tan?

166
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:22,890
Babe.

167
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,760
What’s with you?

168
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,470
Stop it.

169
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:28,510
Don’t tease me.

170
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,360
You like me to call you babe, don’t you?

171
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,820
Last time, you called yourself Phi Q and called me Nong Toey.

172
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:34,500
Stop it.

173
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:40,400
Honestly, no matter what you’re like,

174
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,160
I like you anyway.

175
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,010
Thank you so much.

176
00:10:58,970 --> 00:10:59,380
Huh?

177
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,620
Are you teasing me again?

178
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:08,870
Nope.

179
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,590
I mean it.

180
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,230
Whether it’s the Milk Frappe Boy from back then

181
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,030
or Toey who’s with me now,

182
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:25,910
it feels amazing.

183
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,800
I’m so happy to have you by my side.

184
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:45,010
I’m also really happy that you don’t disappear anymore.

185
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,800
I won’t go away anymore.

186
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:06,830
I promise.

187
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:49,930
[Ao Num Mao, Railay Beach]

188
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,290
Let’s go, babe.

189
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,570
Hey, you two in front,

190
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,770
be careful of getting seasick.

191
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,850
If you’re seasick, I’ll record a video.

192
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:01,090
You guys too.

193
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,130
If any of you is sea sick and throws up,

194
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,870
I’ll record a video.

195
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:04,930
Can you just get in first?

196
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,940
You guys can’t swim, can you?

197
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:07,920
I can.

198
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,350
Come, babe.

199
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:33,010
Babe.

200
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,090
I can’t go on anymore.

201
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,320
Hey, Tan.

202
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,330
You’re throwing up?

203
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,720
Let me help, buddy.

204
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,690
Three, two, one.

205
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:07,070
Toey, you might fall.

206
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,260
Phum, Peem, come here.

207
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:10,000
One, three, one.

208
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:30,240
Hello.

209
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,100
I’ll get an orange juice, please.

210
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:33,590
What about you?

211
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,910
Let me see.

212
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,660
Let’s build his chest muscles.

213
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,410
What do you think? Do you like it?

214
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,440
Whoa. You look cool.

215
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,280
It’s such a big one.

216
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,280
Don’t breathe too hard.

217
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,040
You’re breaking the sand-made muscle.

218
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,600
Tan, are you alright?

219
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:02,690
Come on, Peem.

220
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,800
You don’t know me well enough, huh?

221
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:06,020
I’m fine.

222
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:07,810
I’m okay.

223
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,410
I’m alright.

224
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:12,570
But let me take a nap a little longer.

225
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,940
I’ll do that for you.

226
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:20,580
But just having you by my side, I’m fully recovered.

227
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:24,110
Just take a rest and stay quiet.

228
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:25,770
Oh, babe.

229
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,500
You’re worried about me, right?

230
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:28,430
How cute you are.

231
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,510
I’m blushing.

232
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:30,610
Come on.

233
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,420
You’re dying soon but still haven’t realized it, huh?

234
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:37,140
Whoa. Whoelse can be like you?

235
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:39,760
You’re dying soon

236
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,400
but he still doesn’t even realize you like him.

237
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:43,120
Tan.

238
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,830
I like penguins.

239
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:49,880
Are there penguins in Krabi?

240
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,600
No, of course.

241
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:52,930
There are only sharks and dolphins here.

242
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,730
What a regret.

243
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,660
Pun.

244
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:57,500
Chain likes…

245
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,040
Tan.

246
00:15:58,970 --> 00:15:59,960
…the beach a lot.

247
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,760
Do you know that?

248
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:01,610
I like it a lot, too.

249
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:03,050
Come with him often then.

250
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,760
Fang, slap him once.

251
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,000
Right here.

252
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,150
I know my darling won’t slap me.

253
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,640
I’ll do that.

254
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,100
Peem,

255
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,550
you made such an effort, huh?

256
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,600
You’re sitting far from me.

257
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,900
How about washing your body a bit?

258
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:24,240
I’ve heard that  that music video’s leading man is pretty handsome.

259
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:26,020
Pun. Shit.

260
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:28,950
If my bag gets wet, you’re done for.

261
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,290
I’m sorry.

262
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,290
Pun!

263
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,320
Pun!

264
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:38,900
You usually don’t care about any stuff no matter how expensive it is.

265
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:40,330
How about this one, then?

266
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,870
Why are you so possessive of it?

267
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:43,760
Don’t mess with my business.

268
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,720
I never mess with your comfort doll.

269
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:47,960
I’m not.

270
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,430
I’m just curious why you’re so possessive of it.

271
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,950
I see.

272
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,630
Or did Tan buy this for you?

273
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,700
Hurry up.

274
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,470
Stop it.

275
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:06,720
Actually, it isn’t about the price.

276
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,880
The person who bought it makes this thing important to me.

277
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:11,810
Anyway.

278
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,230
Tell him that you love him often then.

279
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:19,150
Try to say it often or else he will feel slighted.

280
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:19,960
I feel sorry for him.

281
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:23,650
He already knows I love him.

282
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,530
I love him the most.

283
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,630
Did you hear that?

284
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:29,770
Happy now?

285
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,120
I love you too, babe.

286
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:37,160
I love you to the max.

287
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:37,590
Let go.

288
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:38,480
You’re annoying me.

289
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,540
Annoying?

290
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,540
You just said you love me a lot.

291
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:44,660
- What’s up?
- 	Let’s play in the water.

292
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,450
Let’s go.

293
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,440
Go sit next to Chain.

294
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:50,610
Ouch.

295
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,680
I should have sat down gently.

296
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:52,310
My butt hurts.

297
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,030
We’re almost done with our fourth year.

298
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,870
I don’t know how many more chances we’ll get to travel together like this.

299
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,110
Come on, Peem.

300
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,960
After graduation,

301
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,810
I don’t know either how many more chances we’ll get to travel together.

302
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:18,430
But what I know for sure is

303
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:21,440
we four will definitely sleep over at your place.

304
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,230
Did you even ask for my permission?

305
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,300
Did I invite you or what?

306
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:25,970
No invitation needed.

307
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,360
I’ll be there anyway.

308
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:30,440
But today I’m super happy.

309
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:31,970
Right, Chain?

310
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:35,150
Honestly,

311
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,900
I’m super happy to be on a trip with you guys.

312
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:43,820
Why are you getting emotional, huh?

313
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,450
It’s just graduation.

314
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,680
We’re not dying or anything.

315
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:50,740
You’re getting emotional here.

316
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:51,720
I bet you’ll cry soon.

317
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,340
Peem is the first one to cry.

318
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,700
Come. I’ll wipe your tears.

319
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,140
Don’t.

320
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,160
Use the shell to wipe it off.

321
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:00,260
I’m happy to have you all as my friends.

322
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,300
Same here.

323
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,640
Me too.

324
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,190
I’m happy also then.

325
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:11,980
But I’m not.

326
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,840
Eh?

327
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,060
Q, we’re getting emotional here.

328
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:20,700
Look at them

329
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,800
playing like kids.

330
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:32,800
Q!

331
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,260
Q!

332
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,840
Q!

333
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,320
Q!

334
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,540
Walk after me and you’re safe from all the dogs.

335
00:20:58,990 --> 00:20:59,470
Really?

336
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:01,470
Is it because there are no dogs around here?

337
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:02,750
There are some.

338
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,590
Or there aren’t?

339
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:07,880
What?

340
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:09,920
What are you doing?

341
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,020
Why are you riding on my back?

342
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:13,700
My leg hurts.

343
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:16,120
When did you get hurt?

344
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,660
I saw you running around just now.

345
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,370
How did you get hurt?

346
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,960
I wasn’t hurt then but now I am.

347
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,830
Don’t talk too much.

348
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:24,170
Let me ride on your back.

349
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:28,720
Are you serious or joking?

350
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,690
I’m joking.

351
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:31,260
I just want to hug you.

352
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:33,470
Why didn’t you just tell me?

353
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,420
Just tell me directly next time.

354
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:35,160
Don’t make me worry.

355
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:36,360
You worry about me?

356
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:37,800
Uh-huh.

357
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:39,650
I only have one boyfriend

358
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,510
and I love you a lot.

359
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,650
That’s why I’m worried about you.

360
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,810
Gotcha.

361
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,610
You have one boyfriend and worry about him.

362
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:45,680
Why talking too much?

363
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:46,490
You aren’t different from me, though.

364
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,360
You’ve made the seawater sweet.

365
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:49,380
Let’s go, Q.

366
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,930
If we stay, they will tease us.

367
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,280
Yeah. You’re heavy.

368
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,060
I’m going.

369
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:54,560
Babe, look at that.

370
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,040
Follow where my finger points.

371
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,350
Let’s go.

372
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,430
The sea water is sweet now.

373
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,510
Super sweet.

374
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:02,700
As sweet as sugar.

375
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,730
Q, faster.

376
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:05,830
Faster.

377
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:06,870
Faster.

378
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,220
I’m running, okay?

379
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:08,980
You must go faster.

380
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,210
Faster.

381
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,670
I can’t.

382
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,530
Faster.

383
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,340
Faster.

384
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,390
Why are you smiling?

385
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,200
Babe.

386
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:32,370
I like what you’re wearing.

387
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:34,730
This bathrobe?

388
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,670
That’s because I can take it off easily.

389
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:42,670
Like this.

390
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,750
You peck me often already.

391
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,200
Aren’t you bored of it?

392
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:55,910
I never feel bored.

393
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,610
Thank you for loving me, Q.

394
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:06,040
My pleasure.

395
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:46,390
Are you feeling cold?

396
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:50,720
Are you?

397
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:53,720
A bit.

398
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,840
Do you need my hug,

399
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:56,960
so you won’t feel cold?

400
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,920
Are you already hugging me?

401
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:22,700
You were bragging, huh?

402
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:24,840
I still feel cold.

403
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,410
Phum.

404
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:51,350
What is it?

405
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:52,880
Phum.

406
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:55,110
What?

407
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:56,320
Phum.

408
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:58,280
What’s with you?

409
00:25:58,310 --> 00:25:58,850
Phum.

410
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,010
What’s up?

411
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:01,970
Phum.

412
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:03,940
So?

413
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:07,120
What is it?

414
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,000
Nothing.

415
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:12,950
I just want to call your name.

416
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,770
Time flies so fast.

417
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:27,160
I feel as if I just got back from Hua Hin.

418
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:30,800
Peem.

419
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:33,950
I’ve already thought it over.

420
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,400
After this trip,

421
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:39,120
I’ll try talking to my dad.

422
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:51,030
Come with me.

423
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:01,720
Thank you for being a good story in my life.

424
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:05,880
Thank you to you, too,

425
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,260
for allowing me to step into your life.

426
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,600
Why can’t you understand things easily, huh?

427
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,100
Say what?

428
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:02,900
Why should I?

429
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,290
I won’t.

430
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,350
Come on.

431
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,270
Stop being cheesy.

432
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,330
Um…I miss you.

433
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:14,080
Come on. You’re asking what I’m thinking, right?

434
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:15,090
This is the answer.

435
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:20,410
Fine.

436
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:24,140
Happy now?

437
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:25,330
I’ll hang up.

438
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:30,470
Why are you two laughing?

439
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:33,700
Be kind to my friend, will you?

440
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,860
Don’t be in denial.

441
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:36,380
Be sweet to him.

442
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:38,710
Your friend likes to imagine things.

443
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,120
Do you want me to be like him?

444
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,320
Don’t say that.

445
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,320
He already told me

446
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:44,320
what you’re like when you’re alone together.

447
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:51,150
If you already know, why are you complaining?

448
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:55,570
XOXO.

449
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,490
Stop it.

450
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,800
If I do something like that often,

451
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,880
it won’t be special anymore.

452
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:06,380
Eh? Are you seeing Tan?

453
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,800
I’m heading to eat.

454
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:11,350
Aren’t you coming?

455
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:12,880
“I miss you.”

456
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:14,560
Come on.

457
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:15,330
Let’s go already.

458
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,370
Hurry up.

459
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:19,500
I’ve grown up already.

460
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,070
I can walk on my own.

461
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:20,720
Okay.

462
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:21,360
Nice.

463
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,960
Peem, I’m planning to ask you

464
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,300
about teaching arts to students in my foundation.

465
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,310
Sure.

466
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:34,190
I’d love to.

467
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:36,250
Hey, you’re here?

468
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:38,750
Hello.

469
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,210
Hi.

470
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:44,020
Dad, this is Peem, our friend.

471
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:48,320
You’re going to teach arts at our foundation, right?

472
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,240
Yes.

473
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:50,790
How about you, Phum?

474
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:52,790
How is your fourth year going?

475
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:03,500
It’s good, but I’m quite busy with assignments.

476
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:10,960
How about you, Peem?

477
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,010
You’re studying arts.

478
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,340
Do you have many assignments like him?

479
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:16,880
Yes, but it depends on the period.

480
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:18,410
I haven’t gotten much sleep these days.

481
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:20,930
Anyway.

482
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,320
Study well, guys.

483
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,940
It’s your final year.

484
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:24,760
You’re graduating soon.

485
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:28,920
Well, then, let’s have a meal together.

486
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:31,670
Peem, join us.

487
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:32,670
Sure.

488
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,280
Try it.

489
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:50,250
You like it, don’t you?

490
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,040
I do.

491
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:54,090
Thank you.

492
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:55,860
If you like it, eat plenty.

493
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,040
Thanks a lot.

494
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:16,950
Let’s eat.

495
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:26,480
Come.

496
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,400
My boyfriend did a good job.

497
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:44,160
Thank you, Peem, for everything.

498
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,170
I haven’t done anything.

499
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:50,130
You must thank yourself for being brave to open up to him.

500
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:58,480
Well, you're teaching at the foundation, right?

501
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,690
Yeah.

502
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,970
I think the kids will definitely like you.

503
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,250
Do you want to join me?

504
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:10,860
Teach them to draw a whale.

505
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:12,830
You’re teasing me, huh?

506
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:14,390
Nope. I’m not.

507
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:15,560
Are you sure?

508
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,330
Why?

509
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,520
Don’t.

510
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:18,370
Phum.

511
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,160
Stop it.

512
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:20,720
Phum.

513
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:50,080
Go.

514
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:55,630
Look at you.

515
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,010
Who started it?

516
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:28,120
Here.

517
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:29,340
Hold it like this.

518
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:31,340
Give it a try.

519
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,300
I’ve tried so hard that my fingers hurt already.

520
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,950
I really can't play it.

521
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:36,930
See?

522
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,930
Is your finger too short?

523
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:39,460
Fine.

524
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:40,450
It’s just this little.

525
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:43,130
Come on.

526
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:46,780
It looks promising.

527
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:53,610
It's our fourth year already.

528
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:55,320
Am I that old?

529
00:33:57,030 --> 00:34:00,110
I can’t believe how we’ve turned from juniors

530
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,410
Right.

531
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,740
We’ve grown up already.

532
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:04,130
Learn how to use your brain then.

533
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,410
You should say that to yourself first.

534
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:08,469
Hello, Peem, Fai.

535
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:09,560
Hey, Toey.

536
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,760
Why didn't you answer my calls?

537
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,540
I called you many times.

538
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:14,540
What are you guys doing?

539
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:15,429
Have you eaten lunch?

540
00:34:15,449 --> 00:34:16,610
Are you free now, Q?

541
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,130
Wait.

542
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:19,120
Relax.

543
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,900
One question at a time.

544
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:21,830
I couldn’t follow what you said.

545
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,040
You couldn’t?

546
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:24,489
I said every word clearly enough.

547
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:26,400
Do you have a problem with your ears or something?

548
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,389
Old dude.

549
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:29,699
Stop.

550
00:34:29,929 --> 00:34:31,190
Don’t say the word old.

551
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:32,270
It hurts us three at once.

552
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,560
Q, don’t give in.

553
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:35,620
Come on.

554
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:36,670
You were talking nonstop.

555
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:38,530
This is a human’s ear, not a voice recorder.

556
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,800
How could I follow?

557
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:40,590
A voice recorder?

558
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:41,770
What are you talking about?

559
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:44,040
Are you planning to buy one, Q?

560
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,630
Let’s start again.

561
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:51,920
What did you ask?

562
00:34:51,949 --> 00:34:53,100
Oh.

563
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,630
I already forgot.

564
00:34:58,090 --> 00:34:58,790
Eh?

565
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,020
Let’s eat.

566
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,180
Sure.

567
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:08,840
I’ll get going.

568

Your boyfriend is here

569
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:16,370
so you’re leaving your friends just like this?

570
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,160
How annoying.

571
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:20,970
Those in a relationship annoy me.

572
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:21,470
Wait for my turn.

573
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,800
Peem, Fai, I’m leaving.

574

I’m joking.

580
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,220
Why did you take me here?

581
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:44,400
I miss this place.

585
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,280
What do you mean?

586
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,020
I should be the one asking you both.

587
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,400
How have you been doing?

588
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,530
Lots of work, as always.

00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:44,420
It feels like a dream.

759
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,370
But I already knew from the start

760
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:50,310
that your dream would come true.

761
00:47:50,810 --> 00:47:52,640
Thank you for always believing in me.

762
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:58,240
From now on, no matter what happens,

763
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:01,730
I’ll always be here by your side.

764
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:03,090
Don’t worry.

765
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:07,860
Don’t let go of my hand.

766
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:10,290
Never.

767
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:23,820
Hey, what are you doing

768
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,320
even inside the gallery?

769
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:28,720
Gotcha.

770
00:48:28,770 --> 00:48:31,500
This is right inside the gallery.

771
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,030
So what?

772
00:48:35,270 --> 00:48:36,340
Right, Q?

773
00:48:37,930 --> 00:48:39,510
What’s wrong with doing that in the gallery?

774
00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:42,670
Right, Toey?

775
00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:45,710
So what?

776
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:48,990
So what?

777
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:55,550
Right in front of us.

778
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,190
So all of you are here?

779
00:48:59,210 --> 00:49:01,110
I’m here to watch my student’s work.

780
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:03,110
But from watching your work,

781
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:07,110
I think you’re talented already.

782
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:09,490
Absolutely.

783
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,490
Without you, I wouldn’t have graduated.

784
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:18,660
But every of your work involves water.

785
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:21,070
What’s the meaning behind it?

786
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:25,360
Actually, every piece of my work here is our memory.

787
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:32,450
I like water.

788
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:38,730
When I see it, I feel comfortable and safe.

789
00:49:42,450 --> 00:49:46,830
So your work clearly expresses who you are, Peem.

790
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:49,770
We feel comfortable and safe

791
00:49:49,810 --> 00:49:51,120
when we’re with you

792
00:49:52,950 --> 00:49:54,250
unlike when I’m with you, Q.

793
00:49:55,970 --> 00:49:57,750
I feel unsafe.

794
00:49:58,370 --> 00:49:59,830
It’s super dangerous.

795
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:27,840
Guys.

796
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:35,770
I’m happy to have you all as my friends.

797
00:50:43,770 --> 00:50:44,730
Love you guys.

798
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,420
Let’s hug.

799
00:50:47,370 --> 00:50:48,830
Come.

800
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:52,600
Let’s hug.

801
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:58,650
I love you guys.

802
00:50:58,700 --> 00:50:59,930
Same here.

803
00:50:59,970 --> 00:51:00,730
I love you more.

804
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:02,970
Let’s celebrate Peem’s achievement, shall we?

805
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:04,260
His work is displayed in the gallery.

806
00:51:04,310 --> 00:51:05,830
Peem, give me the flower bouquet.

807
00:51:06,470 --> 00:51:07,200
Why?

808
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:07,720
Here.

809
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:08,790
Why are you taking it?

810
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:10,000
I’ll hold it for you.

811
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:11,360
Come here.

812
00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:11,970
Quickly.

813
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:13,440
Come, Peem.

814
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:16,870
Peem, come.

815
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:17,950
Don’t move.

816
00:51:17,970 --> 00:51:19,440
Guys, move closer.

817
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:23,490
One, two, three.

818
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,010
Toey likes Q.

819
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:54,960
- Huh?
- 	Huh?

820
00:51:54,990 --> 00:51:55,690
Huh?

821
00:52:03,730 --> 00:52:04,540
You’re smiling already.

822
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:06,440
Are you serious or joking?

823
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:07,710
I’m serious.

824
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:09,980
Huh?!

825
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:12,720
I’m sorry.

826
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:13,420
I’m sorry.

827
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:14,450
Matt!

828
00:52:14,830 --> 00:52:15,410
Huh?!

829
00:52:18,390 --> 00:52:18,930
Damn it.

830
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:19,670
I’m sorry.

831
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:20,960
Damn it.

832
00:52:20,990 --> 00:52:21,410
Damn it.

833
00:52:21,450 --> 00:52:21,930
Damn it.

834
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:25,440
Huh?

835
00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:27,560
Not yet, dude.

836
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:28,580
You said it too early.

837
00:52:31,430 --> 00:52:32,700
I haven’t said anything.

838
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:34,560
I only know that I love you.

839
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:47,940
Help.

840
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:49,370
I’m doing great here.

841
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:52,420
Q!

842
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,640
(Act upset, Winny.)

843
00:53:02,530 --> 00:53:03,530
Winny, come on.

844
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:06,020
Q, that should be green.

845
00:53:16,590 --> 00:53:17,100
Toey.

846
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:19,300
Look at that couple.

847
00:53:27,190 --> 00:53:28,650
I’m soaked!

848
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:29,460
Toey!

849
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:37,460
(Look at each other.)

850
00:53:37,510 --> 00:53:39,250
(Be ready. I’ll tell you to start.)

851
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:41,820
(Three, two, one.)

852
00:53:41,850 --> 00:53:42,580
(Poon, go ahead.)

853
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:48,560
Pun.

854
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:52,560
Babe, come on.

855
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:54,530
Pay me the house rental fee.

856
00:53:58,970 --> 00:53:59,760
That’s worse.

857
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:10,320
I’m super happy.

858
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:11,780
Fine.

859
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:14,600
What’s damn wrong with him?

860
00:54:20,410 --> 00:54:21,790
Ouch!

861
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:22,750
Shit.

862
00:54:25,010 --> 00:54:25,710
Is it broken already?

863
00:54:25,950 --> 00:54:27,030
You should have said sorry to him.

864
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:28,320
(Done.)

865
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,170
Thank you so much for today.

866
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:35,200
(Look at him and smile.)

867
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:39,980
(Okay. Cut.)

868
00:54:46,430 --> 00:54:47,300
Damn it.

869
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:48,640
You’re so scary.
