1
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:51,420
(I’m Peem, a second-year Fine Arts student.)

2
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,560
(Why did I choose to study Fine Arts?)

3
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,980
(The answer is simple enough.)

4
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:59,740
(I enjoy painting.)

5
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,170
It’s done, finally.

6
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,980
(My dream is to have an art gallery to showcase my work.)

7
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,310
(Apart from having to meet the deadlines,)

8
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:22,120
(my life as a second-year Fine Arts student is pretty peaceful)

9
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,510
(until…)

10
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,509
Hey, pick the ball up for me.

11
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,440
What’s with you?

12
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:37,539
Why are you giving me such a look?

13
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,830
Hey.

14
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:39,840
What’s going on,
Hey.

15
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,470
What’s going on,

16
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:41,740
Phum, Peem?

17
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,070
Just say sorry to me,

18
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,220
and that’s it.

19
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,009
I won’t.

20
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:48,259
You won’t?

21
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,370
Fine.

22
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,160
What’s damn wrong with him?

23
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,100
Ouch!

24
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,810
ONE DAY AGO

25
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,600
What?

26
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:39,230
Who freaking snacked on the model again?

27
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,950
There you go again.

28
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:45,450
This is the last apple already.

29
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,490
If anyone freaking eats it,

30
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:50,380
I hope the professor won’t approve your work.

31
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,090
Come on.

32
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,579
We’ve pulled an all-nighter.

33
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,579
Just let me grab a bite, at least.

34
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Good morning.

35
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,680
Your breakfast is here.

36
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,340
I’ll put it here.

37
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,970
Come get yours.

38
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,630
Eh? Who said he would become a new person this new semester?

39
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,380
We’re almost done with year two soon,

40
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:16,110
but you’re still burning the midnight oil until morning, as always.

41
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,960
You insulted me as soon as you came in.

42
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:19,770
Here’s your breakfast.

43
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:20,910
Thanks.

44
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,540
Have you finished your work?

45
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,860
Seriously, Mr.Peem?

46
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,520
If I did,

47
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:28,520
do you think I would come all the way here this early?

48
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:35,240
Wow. How stunning.

49
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,700
That’s a masterpiece, isn’t it?

50
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,030
Is this Maestro Q’s?

51
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:39,820
Uh-huh.

52
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:40,810
Where is he, by the way?

53
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:43,110
Over there.

54
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,800
Look at him.

55
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,130
No doubt he’s our class’s top dog.

56
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:51,920
Damn it.

57
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:55,329
How could he always finish his work before the deadline?

58
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,960
Is he still alive?

59
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:02,480
Hey.

60
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:08,270
What’s with you?

61
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,520
He’s alive.

62
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,430
Where’s my breakfast?

63
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,180
I didn’t buy one for you.

64
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:16,350
What?

65
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:18,140
I told you I was hungry.

66
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,930
Here’s the deal.

67
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,210
If you help me draw,

68
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,310
I’ll give you one.

69
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,760
Okay?

70
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,670
Give me one.

71
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,640
How many did you buy?

72
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,340
Let me see.

73
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:35,960
Q.

74
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:36,380
Mr.Q.

75
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:37,210
Don’t.

76
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:39,750
Give me one.

77
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:40,630
I’m hungry.

78
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,920
I’m hungry.

79
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:44,700
(This is our lives as second-year Fine Art students.)

80
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,630
(We don’t have regular mealtimes.)

81
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,840
(We don’t get enough sleep either.)

82
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,840
(We have to burn the midnight oil to meet deadlines.)

83
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,560
(Even if we finish it,)

84
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,560
(we don’t know if the professor will approve it.)

85
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,320
(This is the university life I dreamed of, isn’t it?)

86
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,850
DIRECTED BY SIWAJ SAWATMANEEKUL

87
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,560
Again?

88
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,560
Maestro Q got an A again?

89
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,560
- That’s not even surprising.
- 	How annoying.

90
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:46,350
Professor put mine so far away.

91
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,800
Which grade will he give me?

92
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,360
I just hope it’s not a D.

93
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,290
Whoa. I’m fine with that.

94
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,280
It’s a C.

95
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,360
Many of you still missed some details this time.

96
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:02,800
Come on, Prof.

97
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,610
You assigned so much work nonstop.

98
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,230
Who would finish them on time?

99
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,300
Come on.

100
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,880
Add some details.

101
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,080
I’ll check it again later.

102
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,020
By the way,

103
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:17,480
is anyone submitting your work to the art gallery?

104
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,020
I’ll wait to check them out, then.

105
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,680
That’s it for today.

106
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:25,180
See you next class.

107
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,060
- Thank you
- 	Thank you very much.

108
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,320
See you.

109
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:28,480
Thank you.

110
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:36,400
It’s still a relief I got a C.

111
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,200
My work is way more beautiful than yours.

112
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,360
Why did we get the same grade?

113
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,680
You forgot to shade shadows.

114
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:42,680
Oh. You’re right.

115
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,290
Hey.

116
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:51,280
My ultimate dream is to showcase my work in the art gallery.

117
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:52,659
Dreaming big, huh?

118
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,200
What? You can say whatever.

119
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:56,080
Your work has been exhibited many times already.

120
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,420
What’s your plan after class?

121
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:00,790
Help me organize the gallery.

122
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,310
Our third-year seniors asked for us.

123
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:04,130
I’m not available.

124
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:05,730
Who are you going with?

125
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,320
Who could be more important to you than me,

126
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,550
who has been your friend since high school?

127
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,440
Who else could it be?

128
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:11,290
I’m meeting your favorite junior.

129
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:11,990
Oh?

130
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:13,120
I have to help edit his drawing.

131
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:13,990
How troublesome.

132
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:16,720
Hey.

133
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:17,530
Let me be frank with you.

134
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,110
If I had a mentor like you,

135
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,330
I would stick with you until death.

136
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,380
You’re such a maestro.

137
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,470
True.

138
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,610
How annoying.

139
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,640
So, are you helping me or not?

140
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,710
You go first.

141
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,110
I’ll see you at the gallery later.

142
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:31,680
What a wonderful buddy.

143
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:32,650
See you.

144
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,000
Let’s go.

145
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,270
Eh? Q?

146
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,450
What brings you here?

147
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:48,880
Q!

148
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:51,350
Your friend asked me to come.

149
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,830
Come on, Toey.

150
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,470
Are you cheating again?

151
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,010
I’m not.

152
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,010
I just asked my mentor to help review it.

153
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,240
Just review?

154
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,620
Q, my professor assigned a drawing project.

155
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:09,380
But I think something is still missing.

156
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,700
What do you think is missing?

157
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:13,080
Everything.

158
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,700
Don’t tell anyone you’re my mentee.

159
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,400
Pencil?

160
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,440
When you shade shadows,

161
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:31,440
make sure you control your hand pressure properly.

162
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:33,780
Gradually shade from dark to light.

163
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:44,810
Try doing it.

164
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,970
Did you even listen to the professor in class?

165
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,540
Ouch.

166
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,240
Q.

167
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,240
What you learned goes in one ear and out the other.

168
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,020
Try again.

169
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:10,600
Try again.

170
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:11,960
Hold it right.

171
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:06,160
Hold the pencil correctly this time.

172
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,020
Do it well.

173
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,120
I’m holding it like how you did, Q.

174
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,230
Finish it quickly.

175
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,210
I’m hungry.

176
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,950
Are you having a stomachache, Q?

177
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:26,620
On page 47,

178
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,210
you’ll see two types of equations.

179
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,960
Equation A and Equation B.

180
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,530
Students, take a look at them.

181
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:36,520
These two equations are related in three parts.

182
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:39,000
Read and make sure you understand them.

183
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,500
If you don’t,

184
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,650
feel free to raise your hand and ask me.

185
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,150
Hey.

186
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:46,730
I’ll pick Fang up after class.

187
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:48,120
You said you would play football this evening, didn’t you?

188
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,000
Yeah.

189
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,260
I'll quickly send him home

190
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,050
and hurry back.

191
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,500
Okay?

192
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,410
Don’t bail on me.

193
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,070
Got it.

194
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,010
Thanks a lot.

195
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:07,180
Why did you drag me here?

196
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:07,910
What?

197
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,910
Third-year seniors asked for us.

198
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,680
Think of it as training for our own gallery next year.

199
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,220
We’re organizing ours next year, aren’t we?

200
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,070
Have you done with your work, by the way?

201
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,630
You’re helping others here.

202
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:20,140
Why?

203
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,490
Are you worried about me?

204
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:24,280
Do you have feelings for me or what?

205
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,160
Why on earth would I worry about you?

206
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,000
I just don’t want to end up having to help you out.

207
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:34,420
You always agreed to help others

208
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,140
and failed to finish your own work on time.

209
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:37,450
You’re complaining,

210
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,020
but in the end, you’re helping me anyway.

211
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,740
I should have let you struggle on your own.

212
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,030
I mean it.

213
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,380
Stop being a people-pleaser sometimes, will you?

214
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,320
I already know you’re worried about me.

215
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,940
Q, Peem,

216
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,490
help me lift them.

217
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,480
Sure.

218
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,480
Take them outside.

219
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:04,870
Hey there.

220
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:06,280
You almost hit us, can’t you see?

221
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:07,200
Eh? Can I do that now?

222
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,120
Let me start it over again.

223
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:08,560
Wait.

224
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:09,930
Come on.

225
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,170
Why are you here?

226
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:11,750
Huh?

227
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:12,760
What are you here?

228
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,600
Whose motorcycle are you riding?

229
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,640
Give me a second.

230
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,220
I gotta look good.

231
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,270
Someone like me borrowed it from a friend, of course.

232
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,710
Come on.

233
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,990
Q, are you singing at the bar tonight?

234
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:24,870
Yes. Why?

235
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:25,800
Nice.

236
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,930
Let’s drink.

237
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,160
I have something to talk to you about.

238
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,100
What is it?

239
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:30,480
Let’s talk later.

240
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:32,840
So, you two already agreed

241
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:33,480
to join me.

242
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:33,950
Okay?

243
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:34,400
Deal?

244
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,560
Why are you shaking your head?

245
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:41,870
I asked you to come,so you must do so.

246
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,080
You can’t say no.

247
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,890
You two are joining me.

248
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,390
I’ll ask Chain and Pun to join us, too.

249
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,390
See you this evening, guys.

250
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,560
I’ll get going.

251
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,510
Bye.

252
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:03,040
Walking it is a lot easier for me.

253
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:03,320
Bye.

254
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,360
See you guys there.

255
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:09,300
Look at him.

256
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,970
Phum.

257
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:21,970
What do you think?

258
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,970
Cool motorcycle, isn’t it?

259
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,340
Where are you rushing to?

260
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,240
I’m picking Fang up.

261
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:30,490
Oh? Where is Fang?

262
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,240
Do you want me to pick him up?

263
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:31,870
Nope.

264
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:33,060
What?

265
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:34,030
Why?

266
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:36,840
What are you doing this evening?

267
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,400
Do you want to join me at Aueai’s bar?

268
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,420
Which bar?

269
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:42,000
Come on.

270
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:45,240
That’s the bar owned by my Fine Arts senior.

271
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:47,650
You’re out of the loop.

272
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:48,920
I don’t feel like going out tonight.

273
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:50,640
Pshaw.

274
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,890
I was thinking about introducing you to my friends.

275
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,860
I don’t want to know them.

276
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,360
Eh?

277
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:54,720
I’ll get going.

278
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,170
See you.

279
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:57,950
That sounds like you’ve got plenty of friends already.

280
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:02,870
Oh, well, here I go.

281
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:04,160
It’s moving.

282
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:06,320
Give way to a handsome guy, everyone.

283
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,460
Here you are.

284
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,630
Ice bucket.

285
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:21,250
Hello, bro.

286
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,280
Hello.

287
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,820
How have you been?

288
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:26,030
Are you enjoying your second year?

289
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:27,640
How can I enjoy it?

290
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:28,720
We’re swamped with work.

291
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:29,920
Be frank with me.

292
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:31,690
Were you assigned this many projects while you were studying?

293
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,330
Absolutely.

294
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,030
Loads of them.

295
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,400
I didn’t get to sleep.

296
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,820
By the way, I’m curious.

297
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,400
Do you still draw?

298
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:39,880
Why did you ask me that?

299
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,170
Look at your bar.

300
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,140
It’s packed.

301
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,920
So, I’m just wondering if you still get to do what you like.

302
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,720
Sometimes, in my spare time.

303
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,880
I still do.

304
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:49,600
Seriously?

305
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,500
Yeah.

306
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,010
Why would I lie, huh?

307
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,130
Yo, Peem.

308
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:55,970
Oh?

309
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,030
Hello, bro.

310
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:58,570
Whoa.

311
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,050
Look at that greeting.

312
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,190
You shouldn’t have called me bro.

313
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:00,990
You said that yourself, dude.

314
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:03,280
I was kidding.

315
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,080
I thought you meant it.

316
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,930
Come on.

317
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:06,960
Wait. What are you wearing?

318
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:08,530
Pajamas.

319
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:09,430
You haven’t seen them, have you?

320
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:12,690
Idiot, how about heading home to sleep?

321
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,520
Can I?

322
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,460
Hey, stop.

323
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,480
Come here.

324
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,720
By the way, what are you two talking about?

325
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,760
Oh.

326
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:23,040
Well, take care of your friends then.

327
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,800
I’ll take care of my customers.

328
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,520
I’m so tired of seeing him.

329
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,800
Stay and talk to me first.

330
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:28,840
Can I go with you?

331
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:29,560
Sure.

332
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,720
Say nothing.

333
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,400
Just sit.

334
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:33,000
Sit.

335
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:33,600
Say nothing.

336
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,760
You go take care of the customers then.

337
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,320
Yes, sir.

338
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:35,920
Eh?!

339
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,960
You’re rubbing it in.

340
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,020
I’m taking a seat in a cool style.

341
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:42,880
It took you forever to arrive.

342
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:43,670
Have you eaten anything?

343
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:44,760
Yeah,

344
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,050
but Pun hasn’t.

345
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:47,690
He’s been whining all the way here.

346
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,580
True.

347
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:50,640
Peem,

348
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,880
I want to eat some steak.

349
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:54,710
Whoa. You’re requesting something pricey.

350
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,960
Aueai’s bar doesn’t serve steak.

351
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,040
What the hell?

352
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,400
You’re sulking.

353
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:04,400
What’s wrong with you?

354
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:06,119
Just eat the omelet on rice.

355
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,089
Don’t be fussy.

356
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:12,240
Saluting.

357
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,460
Besides singing,

358
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,760
you’re a part-time waiter?

359
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,599
You came late, and now you’re talking too much.

360
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:18,869
Don’t fight.

361
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:19,960
Don’t fight.

362
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:20,970
Let’s drink.

363
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,970
You got it.

364
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,530
Pass it around.

365
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:25,579
Cheers.

366
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:27,589
Bottoms up.

367
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,260
Cheers.

368
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,920
I finished mine.

369
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,180
Drink it up, guys.

370
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,320
Who told you to eat omelet on rice at the bar?

371
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:38,420
Hey!

372
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:38,900
Hey?!

373
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,300
Hey?!

374
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,350
Shit. What the hell?

375
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:43,470
I just saw that there’s no chili sauce.

376
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:47,520
You know, we can’t eat omelet on rice without it.

377
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,100
You almost ate it up.

378
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,480
Why are you asking for it now?

379
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,010
I’ve just figured it out.

380
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,080
You’re a waiter, aren’t you?

381
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:56,080
Can’t you just get me some?

382
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:58,450
You scared me.

383
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:02,880
Hey!

384
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,640
What?

385
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,690
Tan.

386
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,200
Why did you say, “Hey”?

387
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,810
I ran out of my drink.

388
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,470
Why are you guys going back so early?

389
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:19,400
I’m not done singing.

390
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,560
Look at yourself.

391
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:22,640
Why?

392
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:24,200
I look cute, don’t I?

393
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,250
Wow.

394
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,680
You look wasted.

395
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:27,960

396
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,670
Okay.

562
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,910
Yeah.

563
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,540
Why don’t you introduce them to us?

564
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:55,790
We’re in the same university.

565
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,560
Hey, dude.

566
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:59,160
Though we’re in the same university,

567
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,460
we study at different faculties.

568
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,360
Those guys study freaking hard.

569
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,860
It’s tough to even meet up with them.

570
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,960
By the way, are you playing football this evening?

571
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:10,870
Can I join?

572
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,000
Are you going?

573
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:13,950
Yes.

574
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:14,920
Nice.

575
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:16,570
You two?

576
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,600
Count me in.

577
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,510
Cool.

578
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:20,680
You?

579
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,380
I have to…study.

580
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:26,990
Come on, young master.

581
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:30,280
You can hit the books anytime,

582
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,180
but finding time to spend with friends is hard.

583
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:33,960
Got it?

584
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:34,270
Think.

585
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:34,510
Think.

586
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:35,380
Think about it.

587
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:36,510
Fine.

588
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:37,990
You know, I can never say no to you.

589
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,150
Bravo.

590
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:39,800
Nice.

591
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,880
Great.

592
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,620
See you then.

593
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,420
Phum.

594
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:58,590
Well, I have a question.

595
00:25:59,110 --> 00:25:59,920
What is it?

596
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,890
How is Fang doing?

597
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:09,560
Why did you ask about him?

598
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,560
Nothing much.

599
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,350
I just haven’t met your brother for ages.

600
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:18,560
It’s just a usual question, you know.

601
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:20,560
Why? Can’t I ask?

602
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,630
He’s doing fine.

603
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:26,290
He’s quite busy with his study now.

604
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,440
Architecture major has workloads.

605
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,930
I haven’t met him often either.

606
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:31,200
You haven’t?

607
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,320
I see.

608
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,380
Why are you looking at me?

609
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,380
Just keep writing.

610
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,480
Q?

611
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,480
You’re submitting your work for the gallery?

612
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:57,960
Uh-huh.

613
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:58,810
Are you submitting it also?

614
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,600
Nope.

615
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:01,600
I just came to look around.

616
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,890
Where is Peem?

617
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,300
He hasn’t finished his work.

618
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,600
He’s probably out somewhere, finishing his painting.

619
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,960
I guess he just needed a change of scenery.

620
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,310
But I don’t know if he will submit it in time.

621
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:12,370
He’s got this.

622
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,940
We know Peem is talented.

623
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,360
Which one is yours?

624
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,660
Can I take a look?

625
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,390
How nosy.

626
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,830
Fine.

627
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,680
This one?

628
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,710
Like they said, you’re such a maestro.

629
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:54,680
Do you know that you’re my idol, Q?

630
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,810
What's gotten into you?

631
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,320
You suddenly buttered me up.

632
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,520
I just wanted to let you know.

633
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,940
Strange.

634
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,290
Strange.

635
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,020
What are you hiding? Tell me.

636
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,100
- Q!
-  	Say it.

637
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:11,980
Tell me.

638
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,350
Nothing, Q.

639
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:13,840
Say it already.

640
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,250
Nothing, Q.

641
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,610
Next time, I won’t compliment you again.

642
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,210
You won’t?

643
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,300
It’s done, finally.

644
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:04,350
What’s up?

645
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,200
(Are you done?)

646
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,520
(The seniors said they won’t accept it after 6 PM.)

647
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:10,000
Do you think someone like Mr.Peeranat won’t meet the deadline?

648
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,800
It’s cutting it close, though.

649
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,010
(It’s good you finished it in time.)

650
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:15,060
(Where are you now?)

651
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,210
(Do you want me to wait for you at the gallery?)

652
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,400
Eh? Are you there already?

653
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,680
(Yes. I just submitted mine.)

654
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,480
Got it.

655
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,860
I’ll hurry there.

656
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,760
Hello?

657
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,690
Yeah. I’m not standing you up.

658
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:26,340
The class ended late.

659
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,440
I’ll hurry there.

660
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:28,440
Alright. I’ll hang up.

661
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,230
Hey.

662
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,980
Pick up the ball for me.

663
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:32,050
What are you standing there for?

664
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,920
I told you to pick the ball up.

665
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,520
Did you hear what I said?

666
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:39,160
Pick it up.

667
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,260
What’s the holdup?

668
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:43,160
Pick it up.

669
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:44,360
Why are you standing there dumb?

670
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,250
I’m talking to you.

671
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,240
Hurry up.

672
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,080
Hurry up.

673
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,350
Hey, hurry up.

674
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,220
I told you to pick the ball up.

675
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,280
Why are you standing there dumb?

676
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:50,790
Hey?

677
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,920
Hey. I’m sorry.

678
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,280
I dropped my sandal.

679
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:05,600
Pick it up for me.

680
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:08,870
Hey! Pick it up.

681
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:15,270
You threw a sandal at me.

682
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:16,410
Are you asking for trouble?

683
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,960
Who actually asked for trouble?

684
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,010
Seriously, don’t you even want to say sorry?

685
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,350
Will you say sorry?

686
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:30,850
That’s…Phum and Peem.

687
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,930
Hey.

688
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,010
Huh? What’s with you?

689
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:35,010
Hey, guys.

690
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,040
Let’s talk it out nicely,

691
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,300
Phum, Peem.

692
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:39,760
You know this guy, Tan?

693
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,760
Yeah. Peem is my friend.

694
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:42,680
Let go of him, Phum.

695
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:44,270
Hey, what’s going on?

696
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,960
Your friend chucked his sandal at me.

697
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:47,120
He’s clearly looking for a fight.

698
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:47,850
Watch it.

699
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:48,770
Who started this mess?

700
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,470
Peem, relax.

701
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:51,560
What did Phum do to you?

702
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,520
What did he do to me?

703
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,640
Over there.

704
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:56,600
Can you see my painting?

705
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,130
See what he did?

706
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,280
Oh, I also walked across it.

707
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:03,050
So, now what?

708
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:03,800
Tan,

709
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:05,960
whose side are you on?

710
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:16,950
Tan!

711
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:17,530
Come on.

712
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,010
You’re both my friends.

713
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,120
How could I choose?

714
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,600
Guys, don’t fight.

715
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,600
Let’s talk it out nicely.

716
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,800
Just say sorry to me,

717
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,800
and that’s it.

718
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,470
I won’t.

719
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,740
That’s your friend.

720
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:41,800
Fine.

721
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,320
What’s damn wrong with him?

722
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:55,990
Ouch!

723
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:57,990
Shit!

724
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,160
Damn it!

725
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,950
Is he dying?

726
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,360
He’s really your friend, huh?

727
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:05,960
You should have said sorry to him.

728
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:06,430
True.

729
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,520
Shit.

730
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,710
What have I done?

731
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,640
My painting.

732
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,010
My sandal.

733
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:29,220
I have to buy a new one.

734
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,080
To hell with it.

735
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,630
What’s up?

736
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:53,960
I’ve heard you got into a fight.

737
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,560
Fang, you must help me get back at him.

738
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:03,270
Tan’s friend kicked me.

739
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,000
I’m still feeling it.

740
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,020
Do you think it’s still usable?

741
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:08,480
Stop it, Fang.

742
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:14,510
Who dared to kick my brother?

743
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,510
I can’t remember his name.

744
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,530
He’s Tan’s friend.

745
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:22,530
But what I know for sure is

746
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:25,449
you must help me handle him.

747
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:28,800
Okay?

748
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,389
Sure thing.

749
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,429
He’s in for it.

750
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:42,350
By the way, Dad is coming back next month.

751
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,360
That’s got nothing to do with me.

752
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:48,239
Phum.

753
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,550
Stop. Say no more.

754
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,010
I don’t want to listen to it.

755
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,150
Move there.

756
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:07,610
Go ahead.

757
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:08,410
Not that one.

758
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,120
It must be that one.

759
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,030
You’re hitting the creep.

760
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:10,410
Hey.

761
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,000
Look at how I’m playing.

762
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,430
What’s up, guys?

763
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,550
Phum hasn’t arrived?

764
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:15,310
Uh-huh.

765
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,000
He said he would go to the hospital

766
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:17,960
for a proper checkup.

767
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:20,020
Shit. Am I losing already?

768
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,160
Is he that hurt?

769
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:21,750
Of course.

770
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:22,550
I’m losing here.

771
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:23,250
Ptui.

772
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,610
That’s not what I’m talking about.

773
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:28,220
He’s probably just chilling in a VIP suite at the hospital 	to waste money.

774
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,240
Really?

775
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:34,760
I know he’s rolling in money,

776
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,760
but what’s the point of doing that?

777
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,360
I think he’s more upset about the embarrassment

778
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,990
than the pain.

779
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:43,080
He was kicked in front of so many people.

780
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,880
I bet he seriously lost face.

781
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,880
But I still don’t get it.

782
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:50,910
You’d better warn your friend to watch himself.

783
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:53,110
Got it.

784
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,220
I’ll let him know.

785
00:35:57,110 --> 00:36:00,400
Peem, you’re screwed.

786
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:04,760
Guys, I’m off to class.

787
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:05,290
Bye.

788
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:05,740
See you.

789
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,650
See you this evening.

790
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,760
See you.

791
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:10,730
What? What are you hitting?

792
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,110
Pick it up already.

793
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:21,070
Peem, you’re screwed.

794
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,100
What are you doing?

795
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:41,680
Hey?!

796
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:43,110
Nope. I’m not doing anything.

797
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:43,960
I’m not.

798
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:46,360
Hey, you look shady.

799
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:47,490
Did you do something wrong?

800
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,380
Absolutely not.

801
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,230
Or are you avoiding someone?

802
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,800
No way. I didn’t do anything to anyone.

803
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:53,420
Let’s go.

804
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:55,420
- Let’s go to class.
- 	Gotcha.

805
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:56,680
I’m onto you.

806
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,990
[Central Building, Engineering Faculty]

807
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:04,430
What’s up, dude?

808
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:05,160
How are you doing?

809
00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:06,840
How is your Big Boy doing?

810
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,950
Quit laughing.

811
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,820
Follow me.

812
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,910
I need to talk to you.

813
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:13,680
What’s wrong with you, Phum?

814
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:15,760
Phum, stop head-locking me this hard.

815
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,970
What’s the deal, Phum?

816
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:20,370
Where is your friend?

817
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:23,810
Come on. Calm down.

818
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:25,720
Don’t be mad at him.

819
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,820
I’m sure it wasn’t intentional.

820
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,820
You weren’t the one who got hurt, so you can say whatever.

821
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,800
Take me to meet him now.

822
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:33,170
Dude,

823
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:36,000
if I do that,

824
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,370
he’ll be in trouble.

825
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,950
Or do you want me to find him myself?

826
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:43,520
What’s your answer?

827
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:46,760
Fine.

828
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:47,940
I’ll take you to him,

829
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:51,400
but you must promise

830
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:53,990
not to hurt him.

831
00:37:57,990 --> 00:37:59,160
Fine.

832
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,360
I won’t.

833
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,140
You promised already.

834
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,820
Yeah. Come on.

835
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:03,620
Let’s go.

836
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:04,260
Wait.

837
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,300
Come here.

838
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:07,760
What now?

839
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,760
I also need something in exchange.

840
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,430
What have I done?

841
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,360
You’re spacing out this early morning.

842
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,560
Hey.

843
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:33,680
I’ve heard you got into a fight at the football field.

844
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,800
Don’t bring it up.

845
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,410
It’s giving me the shivers.

846
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:37,880
I’m worried he’ll retaliate.

847
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,750
How did it happen?

848
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:42,790
He wrecked my work

849
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:43,300
but didn’t say sorry,

850
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:44,520
and also got on my nerves.

851
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,570
Can you believe it?

852
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:49,270
I’ve heard he’s a top brat.

853
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:51,970
Who’s he?

854
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:54,910
Phum, an engineering major.

855
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:55,570
Have you heard of him?

856
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,570
Shit. It’s him?

857
00:38:57,610 --> 00:38:58,440
Why?

858
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,530
I think you picked the wrong fight, Peem.

859
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:03,580
To that extent?

860
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:04,560
Of course.

861
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,820
Nobody messes with him

862
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,520
unless they want trouble.

863
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,460
I guess I will be fine.

864
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,840
He won’t do anything.

865
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,160
At least I have you guys with me.

866
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:16,970
I won’t help.

867
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:17,790
Eh?

868
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:20,350
Brat, I won’t forget what you said.

869
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:25,680
But he’s Tan’s friend, isn’t he?

870
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:28,660
I think you guys can talk it out.

871
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,960
Don’t let me talk about Tan.

872
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:34,390
Yesterday, he just stood there and didn’t even lift a finger to help me.

873
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,390
Tan?

874
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:36,760
Uh-huh.

875
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:38,940
Oh.

876
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:39,960
There he is.

877
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,370
Peem!

878
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:42,370
Speak of the devil.

879
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,860
Come sit here.

880
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:47,040
You just did nothing.

881
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,090
Damn it.

882
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:54,160
Bear in mind how much you messed with me.

883
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:54,960
Come.

884
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:59,800
Hey, where are you taking my friend?

885
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:00,710
Just talk here.

886
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:02,100
He’s right.

887
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,870
I think you should talk to him here.

888
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:04,710
There’s no need to go somewhere else.

889
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:05,130
Right?

890
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,570
I won’t hurt your friend.

891
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,450
If you guys don’t want this to become a big deal,

892
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:11,230
let him come with me.

893
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,170
How can I trust you?

894
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:13,950
You promised already.

895
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,200
Don’t hurt my friend.

896
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,100
I told you I won’t.

897
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,140
I don’t trust you.

898
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,680
I told you already.

899
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:21,600
I don’t trust you.

900
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:22,840
I said, let him come with me.

901
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,370
Let’s talk here.

902
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,860
Q.

903
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:28,880
Just let them talk.

904
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,490
Phum won’t hurt him.

905
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,490
He’s a man of his word.

906
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,330
Am I right?

907
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:39,360
Fine.

908
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:41,000
You guys are unbelievable.

909
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Follow me.

910
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:46,500
Tan, I won’t forget what you did to me.

911
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:46,790
I won’t.

912
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,900
Bye-bye.

913
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,320
Good luck, buddy.

914
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:54,110
Peem will be okay, right?

915
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:58,880
Don’t worry, guys.

916
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,560
Phum won’t hurt Peem.

917
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:01,880
If he does something to him,

918
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,230
you’ll be the first person I handle.

919
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,360
Me?

920
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,040
Certainly.

921
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,240
Yeah.

922
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,310
Fine.

923
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:10,140
He won’t hurt him.

924
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:10,960
If he does,

925
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,240
I’ll let you two punch my mouth.

926
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:15,970
You said that yourself.

927
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,320
I’m just kidding.

928
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:18,600
I’m screwed.

929
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:22,280
Hey, where are you taking me?

930
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:22,840
Hey.

931
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,800
I’m sorry.

932
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:24,440
I’m sorry.

933
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:24,960
I’m giving in.

934
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:25,970
Let go of me.

935
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:26,710
I’m begging you.

936
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:27,980
I guess it’s too late.

937
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:30,810
Sympathize with me, will you?

938
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,730
Let go of me.

939
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:35,960
Fine.

940
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:37,240
I already warned you.

941
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:39,240
What are you doing?

942
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,050
You didn’t agree to let go of me.

943
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:41,940
You want it this way, huh?

944
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,120
Let go of my arm.

945
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:43,800
Ouch!

946
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:46,440
Let go of me already.

947
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:47,440
You let go first.

948
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,840
Ouch!

949
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,800
Alright then.

950
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,000
I’ll count to three,

951
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:52,960
and then we let go.

952
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Deal?

953
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,420
One, two, three.

954
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:59,310
Gotcha.

955
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,170
You didn’t let go of me.

956
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,680
I’ll count that as a practice round, then.

957
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:03,750
One.

958
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,270
Two.

959
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:09,890
Three.

960
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:16,100
Why did you bring me here?

961
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:19,040
You’ve hurt me twice already.

962
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,950
You dragged me here like this.

963
00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:22,250
Are you a mafia?

964
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:25,240
You must take responsibility.

965
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:26,360
For what?

966
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,160
You must compensate for hurting me.

967
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,250
[Vat 7%]
[Total cost]

968
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:41,360
200K?

969
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:42,480
You’ve got to be kidding me!

970
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,270
How on earth did the treatment cost 200K?

971
00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:45,990
It was just a kick.

972
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:50,050
Oh.

973
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:52,310
Why?

974
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:57,780
Don’t tell me…it’s ruined.

975
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:01,310
You can’t use it anymore?

976
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:08,920
I don’t know.

977
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:11,420
I can’t afford to pay 200K.

978
00:43:14,410 --> 00:43:18,340
You must compensate with something else, then.

979
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:20,940
Like what?

980
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:55,970
DIRECTED BY SIWAJ SAWATMANEEKUL

981
00:43:56,030 --> 00:43:58,400
Peem!

982
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,940
So, what did Phum talk to you about?

983
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:04,240
Be my slave.

984
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:07,920
Don’t tell anyone I’m your slave.

985
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:08,540
Deal.

986
00:44:09,010 --> 00:44:09,540
Deal.

987
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:11,520
Bottoms up.

988
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:13,500
Are you alright?

989
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:14,830
Put up with it.

990
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:15,870
The taxi is arriving.

991
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:19,400
Peem,

992
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:20,620
why are you sprawled out like trash here?

993
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:21,820
Phum, give him a lift.
