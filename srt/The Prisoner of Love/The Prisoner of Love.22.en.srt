00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:39,220
=The Prisoner of Love=

2
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,540
=Episode 22=

3
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:55,840
Xu Yunze.

4
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:02,430
Where are you taking me?

5
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,750
Where is Chen Fengxue?

6
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:06,880
He said he had his responsibility
to attend to as the general.

7
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:09,000
He'd head back
to talk things over with his nephew.

8
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:10,840
I bet

9
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,560
he's in Daliang City now.

10
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,560
We shall bid our farewell here.

11
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:35,790
Sir.

12
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:37,950
Are you really seeing His Majesty alone?

13
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,590
He won't let you go.

14
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:41,950
Unless I put an end to it,

15
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,560
the emperor will send his men after me
and Ningyun no matter where we go.

16
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,710
That isn't the life she wants.

17
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:48,760
But, sir,

18
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:50,680
if you were perished,

19
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:51,640
I...

20
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,000
If that happened,

21
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,200
that'd be my fate.

22
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,840
Have you seen to what I asked you to do?

23
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,480
Keep it well.

24
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,640
I will send you
a pigeon letter every day.

25
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:12,000
If you don't receive one
three days in a row,

26
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,360
open this brocade pouch
and come to my rescue.

27
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,080
Yes, sir.

28
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,280
Go!

29
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,710
Take care, sir!

30
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,560
Xu Yunze.

31
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,800
How dare you

32
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,590
to have me tied up!

33
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,030
Miss Ningyun.
Stop staring at me like that.

34
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,590
I can't run anywhere

35
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,310
in this condition.

36
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,400
Aren't you going to tell me the truth?

37
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:54,590
Mr. Xu.

38
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,800
What are you doing here?

39
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,280
I came

40
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,430
to request a collaboration with you.

41
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:07,360
How can we make that happen
when we're on bad terms?

42
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,430
I believe

43
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,960
we're on the same page

44
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,280
when it comes to Ningyun's safety.

45
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:19,400
The emperor

46
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,000
has launched a manhunt on me.

47
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,240
So I need to make sure she's safe.
I don't want to drag her into it.

48
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,030
You want to save Miss Ningyun?

49
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:31,520
Yes.

50
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,910
I want you to take her away.

51
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,800
And I will go talk things over

52
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,000
with my nephew.

53
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,870
I swear I'm telling the truth.

54
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,000
This is between him and his nephew.

55
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,710
Miss Ningyun.
You'd better stay out of it.

56
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,750
Indeed.

57
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:55,680
That's what he's like.

58
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,400
Once he's made up his mind,

59
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,080
nobody can stop him.

60
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,470
I thought it was a serious matter.

61
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,800
Now that we've talked it out,

62
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,280
why am I still tied up?

63
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,750
Quickly untie me.

64
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,560
My wrists hurt so bad.

65
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,750
But Chen Fengxue said...

66
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,030
Whose side are you on?

67
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,310
Are you going
to keep me tied up forever?

68
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:17,950
Hurry.

69
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:31,000
Miss Ningyun...

70
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,440
I hope the physician's sedative
can give you a good sleep.

71
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:18,040
Chen Fengxue!

72
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:39,950
Chen Fengxue!

73
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,310
How dare you leave me behind!

74
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:41,830
You!

75
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,120
I'm sorry.

76
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,360
Although
I've lost all of my martial skills,

77
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,400
that doesn't mean I cannot be of help.

78
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,720
If I hadn't

79
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,160
come prepared,

80
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:08,950
you would've been...

81
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:11,680
Ningyun.

82
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:16,720
I, Chen Fengxue,
will never push you away again.

83
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,760
As long as you are safe.

84
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:30,750
Eunuch Liu.

85
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,600
Should I see my uncle or not?

86
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,270
(Eunuch Liu, Chief Eunuch)
Your Majesty,

87
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:41,000
you know what to do.

88
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,950
I should see him.

89
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,190
But I'm afraid I will go soft

90
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,190
at his sight.

91
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,120
General Zhao requests an audience.

92
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,160
Come in.

93
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,680
Greetings, Your Majesty.

94
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:04,510
Where is he?

95
00:08:05,367 --> 00:08:06,190
Is he dead or alive?

96
00:08:06,654 --> 00:08:07,390
Your Majesty.

97
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:08,800
General Chen

98
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:09,870
has escaped.

99
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,270
What did you just say?

100
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,040
I said

101
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,750
bring him here,

102
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,310
dead or alive.

103
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,560
But you failed your mission!

104
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,560
I am guilty.

105
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,830
I have dispatched our men

106
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,800
to search for both General Chen
and Xiao Ningyun.

107
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,240
Let me say this again.

108
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,750
Bring him here,

109
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:27,950
dead or alive.

110
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,270
If not,

111
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,750
you will be beheaded.

112
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:33,640
Yes, Your Majesty.

113
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,360
Where are we going next?

114
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,920
A small town in the suburb.

115
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:44,840
Though

116
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,790
it isn't as bustling as Daliang City,
it is a laid-back place to be.

117
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,630
I ever recuperated there for some time.

118
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,550
Aren't you afraid the emperor

119
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:54,200
will find you there?

120
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,600
That's exactly what I want.

121
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,790
What do you mean?

122
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,080
One could live like a recluse
in a bustling city. Just leave that to me.

123
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,120
I've got you a surprise.

124
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:04,390
A surprise?
