=Episode 7=

3
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,850
You remember everything.

4
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,360
Ningyun.

5
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,640
I still hold dear to your heart,

6
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:50,850
right?

7
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,000
I still remember
everything that happened

8
00:00:58,530 --> 00:00:59,810
vividly.

9
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:04,560
I've been nothing but sincere.

10
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,280
But how much

11
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,410
does your sincerity worth?

12
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:15,330
Sir.

13
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,280
Xiao Ningyun.

14
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:18,809
Did you think

15
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:20,130
I released Xiao Zijin

16
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,720
due to your moving performance?

17
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:25,560
How naive of you.

18
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,210
Xiao Ningyun.

19
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,360
I let Xiao Zijin go

20
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,369
because I wanted him

21
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:38,050
to tell the remaining members
of the Xiao family that you've betrayed them.

22
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:40,369
You've been shameless enough
to serve your enemy

23
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:42,360
just to save your own skin.

24
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,280
Xiao Ningyun.

25
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,089
Those memories you've had

26
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:49,490
disgust me.

27
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,440
You worth nothing

28
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,360
in my heart.

29
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:59,139
Sir.

30
00:01:59,140 --> 00:01:59,979
I have lost

31
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,330
everything.

32
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:03,130
I'm relying on those memories

33
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,280
shared with you

34
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:07,209
to stay alive,

35
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,400
sir.

36
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:15,120
Are you still trying to gain my trust
with that tacky act of yours?

37
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,049
Whether or not you believe me,

38
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:17,939
I don't care.

39
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,170
It's okay if I'm called
a traitor of the Xiao family.

40
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,960
As long as I can live a decent life,

41
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:23,169
I am

42
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:24,329
even willing

43
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:25,920
to be your toy.

44
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:28,890
Sir.

45
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:30,730
Xiao Ningyun.

46
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:33,570
Just how many tricks are there
up your sleeve?

47
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,680
Be my guest.

48
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:41,960
Scram.

49
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:44,769
I don't want to see

50
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:46,210
your disgusting face.

51
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,010
Xiao Ningyun.

52
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,120
I will never
let you change my mind again.

53
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,920
You are just like

54
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:33,610
my leg.

55
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,450
I feel reluctant

56
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,730
but numb.

57
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:55,680
(Chen Fengxue is
both unpredictable and scheming.)

58
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,009
(Looks like)

59
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:58,770
(my effort of gaining his trust)

60
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,449
(by playing the sympathy card)

61
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:01,800
(has proved to be futile.)

62
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,640
(I must come up with another way.)

63
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,520
(But what can I do to gain his trust?)

64
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:09,080
(After all, I'm just a cripple
through and through.)

65
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,690
Sir.

66
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,729
Miss Xiao, what brings you here

67
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:46,810
today?

68
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:48,890
Sir.

69
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,729
I'm here

70
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:52,250
to make

71
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:54,400
the cure to General Chen's condition.

72
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,930
I ever consumed a Thousand Snow Pill

73
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,619
to nourish my physique.

74
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:03,219
That pill is claimed
to be the cure to many poisons.

75
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,450
The medicinal properties of that pill
still run in my blood.

76
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:13,129
The fact is your blood only enables
General Chen's temporary mobility.

77
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:14,720
It doesn't cure
his condition completely.

78
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:17,640
Perhaps

79
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,459
the poison in the blood

80
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,609
is reducing

81
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:21,690
as time goes by.

82
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:23,049
Or

83
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,600
the blood extracted

84
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,570
was insufficient.

85
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:29,810
That's why General Chen
could only stand for a moment.

86
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,859
I did consider that possibility.

87
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:36,720
But if we extract more blood...

88
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,929
You're in a fragile state.

89
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:40,040
I'm afraid

90
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,960
your life will be in danger.

91
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,330
Please extract my blood.

92
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,779
Unless General Chen issues an order,

93
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,249
I dare not

94
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,010
put your life at risk.

95
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:55,250
Thank you for your time.

96
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:05,930
Well, why are they

97
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,640
tormenting one another?

98
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,010
Sir!

99
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:16,010
This is bad!

100
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,520
General Chen has vomited blood again!

101
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:38,539
- Make way! General Chen is dying!
- You still dare not give that a try?

102
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,249
You do know

103
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,250
that only I can save
General Chen's life.

104
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:53,370
Let's make one thing clear.

105
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,779
You might die in your sleep

106
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,570
from excessive loss of blood.

107
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:58,779
I am all alone in this world now.

108
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,689
And I will never
get to leave this mansion.

109
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:01,929
I will save General Chen

110
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:02,929
even if

111
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,400
it costs my life.

112
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,640
You know nothing about him.

113
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:13,520
Indeed.

114
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:22,979
General Chen is not doing okay!

115
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,370
Where is the physician?

116
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,450
This will decide General Chen's fate.

117
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:14,640
Let General Chen lie down.
I will perform acupuncture on him.

118
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,520
The general's just had the medicine.
Can he take this?

119
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,840
You know nothing.

120
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,210
Acupuncture

121
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:22,810
can ease his meridians

122
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:24,640
and help the medicinal blood

123
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:26,520
flow into his organs more quickly.

124
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:40,690
The general is up.

125
00:08:58,890 --> 00:08:59,960
Let go.

126
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,170
Sir.

127
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,880
No rush.

128
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,170
I'm well and alive.

129
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,840
And you're disobeying me already?

130
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:42,810
See?

131
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,530
I can walk now.

132
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:47,530
This is truly a rare sight.

133
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,930
Congratulations, sir!

134
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:56,570
But why am I able to walk
all of a sudden?

135
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:01,880
I am sorry, sir.

136
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,450
Xiao Ningyun offered
to save your life with her blood.

137
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,600
I'm afraid she's already...

138
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:24,840
Ningyun.

139
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:27,480
Wake up.

140
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,360
Open your eyes and look at me!

141
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,930
Wake up already.

142
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:34,649
Ningyun.

143
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:35,570
Please wake up.

144
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:56,650
Chen Fengxue.

145
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,000
We're even now.

146
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:01,810
We owe each other nothing now.

147
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:05,120
Why did you offer to save me?

148
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:08,210
You should be hating me, no?

149
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:11,080
We should hate one another.

150
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,450
What gives you the right
to make me owe you my life?

151
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:25,570
Xiao Ningyun.

152
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,760
I will not let you get your way.

153
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:30,690
You owe me everything

154
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:33,000
in this lifetime!

155
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:17,810
I can give you whatever you want.

156
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:19,720
All I want is you.

157
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,450
Is that so?

158
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,760
I want Xiao Ningyun dead, then.

159
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:31,840
I want her to live miserably.

160
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:34,410
As you wish.
