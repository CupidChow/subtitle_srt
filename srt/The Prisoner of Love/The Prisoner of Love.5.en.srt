00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,540
=Episode 5=

3
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:48,600
Talk.

4
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:52,240
How do you communicate
with the remnants?

5
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,520
Kill me if you want.

6
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,000
Spare me the chitchat!

7
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:06,920
Xiao Ningyun.

8
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,480
Xiao Zijin is in my hand.

9
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,790
Are you aware of your crime?

10
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:14,680
Release my brother.

11
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:20,840
Sure.

12
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,280
End his suffering.

13
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,230
Do it,

14
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,400
you and your brother shall live.

15
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,200
Cursed scoundrel!

16
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:44,350
Miss Xiao.

17
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,710
Kill me.

18
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,590
I can die for the Xiao family.

19
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,870
Let me have an honorable death.

20
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,510
Guards!

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,480
Yes.

22
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,120
I want Xiao Zijin's head delivered

23
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,790
to Miss Xiao!

24
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:02,310
No!

25
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,710
Miss Xiao.

26
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,590
Kill me.

27
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,630
Dying by your hand

28
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:43,030
shall leave me with no regrets.

29
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:51,870
One.

30
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:54,590
Two.

31
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,560
Do it!

32
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,750
Mr. Xu has done a great deal
for the Xiao family.

33
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,150
I can't take his life.

34
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,750
Your bond is admirable.

35
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,870
I can't throw away
the chance to do you a favor.

36
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,760
I have a proposition, Xiao Ningyun.

37
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,150
I'll give you a cage.

38
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,750
Whether you live or die,

39
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,870
Xu Yunze gets to live.

40
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,120
Change into this outfit

41
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,470
and wait at the hill.

42
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,320
We'll leave together.

43
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,120
As I said,

44
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:20,160
I like you.

45
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,160
I mean it.

46
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,480
I will prove it to you.

47
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,160
Sir,

48
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,240
do you really trust Miss Xiao

49
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,000
to run away with you

50
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,440
and leave Southern Chen?

51
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,480
It's a leap of faith.

52
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,240
The clothes are poisoned.

53
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,390
Chen Fengxue.

54
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,070
You mustered troops for a rebellion.

55
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,390
I was ordered to apprehend you.

56
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,160
Miss Xiao was brilliant.

57
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,190
Heroes always fall prey to the damsels.

58
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:05,240
Sir,

59
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,360
it was Miss Xiao.

60
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,120
She set you up!

61
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,270
Arrest them.

62
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,240
Talk.

63
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:22,480
Are you

64
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,390
the spy who stole
my map of Southern Chen?

65
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,750
I'm not!

66
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:30,160
Perhaps some pain can make you talk.

67
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,120
Xiao Ningyun!

68
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,040
I hate you!

69
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,070
As long as I live,

70
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,480
I'll vanquish your entire family!

71
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,920
I'll make you beg for my mercy!

72
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:08,600
Xiao Ningyun.

73
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,070
How could you do this to me?

74
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:12,560
Why?

75
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,240
General,

76
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,480
Miss Xiao had a heatstroke.

77
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,830
There is stagnant blood in her limbs.

78
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,640
A circulation treatment should heal her.

79
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,310
She was saved in time.

80
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,600
Any delay

81
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,920
could have taken her life.

82
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,360
You can save anyone.

83
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,430
Do you best.

84
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,270
I'm flattered.

85
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:14,870
But General,

86
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,240
is this necessary?

87
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,680
You want to save her
after torturing her.

88
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,270
Do you find this fun?

89
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:22,950
She owes me too much.

90
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,600
She doesn't deserve a swift death.

91
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:37,510
Ningyun.

92
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:40,560
I believed you'd take me with you.

93
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,390
I believed that you loved me.

94
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,070
But how did you repay my trust?

95
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,600
Run.

96
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,560
Run.

97
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:56,920
Where to?

98
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,600
Is it Xu Yunze?

99
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,040
You're awake.

100
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,000
A life for a life. You said so.

101
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,510
Why did you save me?

102
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,070
Or perhaps

103
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,070
you killed Xu Yunze?

104
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,430
You care deeply about him.

105
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:30,870
I only ask that

106
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,390
you don't break your promise.

107
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,670
Eat up.

108
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,390
Take me to him.

109
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,400
Eat the porridge.

110
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,790
I want to know if he's safe.

111
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,030
Eat your food.

112
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:43,750
Otherwise, you will never

113
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,960
see him again.

114
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,670
Good girl.

115
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,150
Your attitude

116
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
should be rewarded.

117
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:03,630
Miss Xiao.

118
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,870
Are you alright?

119
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,510
Xu Yunze.

120
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,480
I've repaid your kindness.

121
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,720
Your life is yours.

122
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,670
Miss Xiao...

123
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,270
From now on,
we go on our separate paths.

124
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,360
Miss Xiao?

125
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,080
General.

126
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:28,440
We're leaving.

127
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,320
Miss Xiao!

128
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,150
(Chen Fengxue,)

129
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,550
(I don't know why you spared me.)

130
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,390
(But, I know)

131
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:46,870
(you want to torture me)

132
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,670
(and my loved ones.)

133
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,600
(Since I can't escape your grasp,)

134
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,600
(then I shall stay.)

135
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,550
(Crushing me)

136
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:57,200
(will mean cutting yourself.)

137
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,240
(I'll take you down with me.)

138
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:15,030
Miss Xiao, are you
throwing yourself at me?

139
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:16,750
Yes.

140
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,360
Do you like it?

141
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:20,910
What do you want?

142
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,840
Do I still get

143
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,790
the chance

144
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,480
to tempt you?
