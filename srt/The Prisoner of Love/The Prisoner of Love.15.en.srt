=The Prisoner of Love=

2
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,540
=Episode 15=

3
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,090
Your Majesty.

4
00:00:58,530 --> 00:00:59,329
The general

5
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:00,600
has passed.

6
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:03,569
Are you sure?

7
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:04,920
Absolutely.

8
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:06,539
It won't be long until

9
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,130
those of the General's Mansion

10
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:09,890
report it to Your Majesty.

11
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,520
I don't believe it.

12
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:13,690
Prepare the carriage.

13
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,520
Uncle.

14
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:57,440
How many times have I wished
for your death?

15
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,720
Yet now that you're truly dead,

16
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:05,000
I feel no joy at all.

17
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,290
Your Majesty, my condolences.

18
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:14,120
Pass my decree.

19
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:17,290
Bury him in the Songshan Imperial Crypt
with the rites of a sovereign.

20
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,120
Grant him the title Prince Wuxian.

21
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:38,520
What happened?

22
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:41,490
Chen Fengxue is dead.

23
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:42,840
Tomorrow, he will be

24
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,120
buried in Songshan Imperial Crypt.

25
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,259
(Chen Fengxue!)

26
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,329
(Stop!)

27
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:58,379
(From this day forth,)

28
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,290
(you are my lowliest servant)

29
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,520
(for all eternity!)

30
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,610
I can give you everything you want.

31
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,640
Let me have you.

32
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:08,920
Will you?

33
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,680
(Chen Fengxue!)

34
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,730
(I'll wait for you to marry me.)

35
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,960
I told you my life was yours.

36
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,050
In life or death.

37
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,330
No, Miss.

38
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:27,730
It's too dangerous.

39
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,169
We just got out.

40
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,610
I must go back.

41
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:31,920
Miss!

42
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:33,450
Back off!

43
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:50,360
(Chen Fengxue.)

44
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,010
(I, Xiao Ningyun,)

45
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:56,890
(will never again love
anyone so deeply)

46
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,240
(or hate them just as much.)

47
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:12,610
Miss.

48
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,040
If you can't save her,

49
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,019
I'll make sure you die the worst death.

50
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,330
I can save her,

51
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,160
but not for you.

52
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,450
It's for the general.

53
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:40,570
How is she?

54
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:44,169
She's poisoned.

55
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:45,459
If I'm not mistaken,

56
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,169
she poisoned herself.

57
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:48,330
Impossible.

58
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,579
You posed as a recluse and snuck into

59
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,609
the General's Mansion.

60
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:53,689
Didn't you use her blood to sustain him

61
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,040
and fool everyone?

62
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,210
It's possible

63
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:58,570
that back then,

64
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,160
she poisoned herself over time.

65
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,600
Why would she taint her own blood?

66
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:08,570
Every medicine in the General's Mansion
is tested for poison.

67
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,689
She could only poison herself.

68
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:12,210
So, her blood carried the poison.

69
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,400
This poison is called Heaven Silkworm.

70
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:16,459
It's a slow-acting toxin.

71
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,570
Hard to trace.

72
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:18,890
Perhaps...

73
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,600
She wanted to die with the general.

74
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:24,330
Why?

75
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,010
Why would she...

76
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,130
This poison takes a year to manifest.

77
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:31,219
But now,

78
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,600
it's attacking her heart.

79
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:34,130
I fear that...

80
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,280
There's no cure.

81
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,520
I'll say this again.

82
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:40,419
Save her

83
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,520
or die!

84
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,010
Killing me won't change anything.

85
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,419
Unless someone raises a red worm

86
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,570
in their body.

87
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,400
Once it matures, they must consume it.

88
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:51,289
It can absorb the poison

89
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:52,210
from the blood.

90
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,890
- Only then can she be saved.
- Where is the red worm?

91
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,640
With Mr. Jue Yu.

92
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,249
However,

93
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,459
he's the general's master.

94
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,210
Only the general can persuade him.

95
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,810
But unfortunately, the general is...

96
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:09,160
How much time does she have left?

97
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:13,080
All we can do Is help her

98
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,690
make it through the night.

99
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,810
I'll wait for you.

100
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,450
Chen Fengxue.

101
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:21,890
Chen Fengxue.

102
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,099
Tell me,

103
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,010
if you could never leave Xiao's Mansion,

104
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,810
would you be sad?

105
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:29,890
I would have been.

106
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,489
Not anymore.

107
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:32,520
Why?

108
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:35,929
Because

109
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,010
I have you now.

110
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,659
Your heart

111
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,080
is my prison.

112
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,520
I am willing to be trapped in it.

113
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,249
Chen Fengxue,

114
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,289
trust me on this.

115
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:49,520
I will get you out of here.

116
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,339
Once I leave this place,

117
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,049
I will make a name for myself.

118
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:56,210
And when I return,
I will give you a grand wedding.

119
00:06:58,610 --> 00:06:59,400
All right.

120
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,250
Chen Fengxue.

121
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:13,930
Miss.

122
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,600
Miss, are you all right?

123
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:17,520
Miss?

124
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,810
I saw him yesterday.

125
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,570
You saw him?

126
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:32,810
He's dead.

127
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,810
You gave him the lethal strike.

128
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:36,689
That's impossible.

129
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:37,899
It's not possible.

130
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:38,899
I didn't do it!

131
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,099
I missed

132
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,289
when I struck!

133
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:42,019
Believe me.

134
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:42,899
He couldn't have died.

135
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:43,249
Miss.

136
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:43,809
Believe me!

137
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:44,369
Miss.

138
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:45,099
I didn't do it.

139
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,130
Listen to me.

140
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,250
Let me take you away from here.

141
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:49,809
We'll leave

142
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:50,609
Southern Che.

143
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:51,809
Let's go far away.

144
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:53,520
Let's leave Chen Fengxue behind.

145
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,250
Leave...

146
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,080
Take me to that hill.

147
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,419
The hill

148
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,330
where you can see
Songshan Imperial Crypt.

149
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,600
Is it worth it?

150
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:11,370
Is this worth it, Miss?

151
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,890
Chen Fengxue

152
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,160
was so cruel to you.

153
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:18,040
And yet...

154
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,600
It's worth it.

155
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,280
Between him and me,

156
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:23,289
who wronged whom,

157
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:23,929
who owed whom

158
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:24,979
no longer matters.

159
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,010
We owe each other nothing now.

160
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:27,960
I mean it.

161
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,330
Take me there.

162
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,453
Take me there.

163
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,129
Please?

164
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:33,889
I beg you.

165
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:34,960
Please?

166
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:45,840
I know.

167
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:47,720
I probably

168
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:49,240
won't live another day.

169
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,450
If I die,

170
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,720
bury me

171
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:05,480
on that little hill.

172
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,690
Set my tombstone

173
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:10,810
facing

174
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,450
Songshan Imperial Crypt.

175
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,480
I want to watch him.

176
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,720
I want to watch him.

177
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,840
Xu Yunze.

178
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:41,810
Is there wind?

179
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,450
Why...

180
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,760
Why is my sight blurred?
