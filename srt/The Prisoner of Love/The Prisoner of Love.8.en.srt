=The Prisoner of Love=

2
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,540
=Episode 8=

3
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,360
Sir.

4
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,800
Miss Xiao

5
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,009
has always weak.

6
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:13,550
After what happened earlier,

7
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:16,590
I'm afraid...

8
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,880
Do your job, then.

9
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,360
Get those imperial physicians
from the palace here.

10
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,000
If you fail to treat her,

11
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:32,920
you all will join her in afterlife!

12
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:34,190
Scram!

13
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,110
Yes, sir!

14
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:01,440
Physician.

15
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:03,950
How is Xiao Ningyun doing?

16
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,240
Even deities wouldn't
be able to save her.

17
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,150
Those good-for-nothings!

18
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:19,710
Sir.

19
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,390
What are you doing here?

20
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:27,040
Your legs...

21
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,920
If you have nothing else, get lost.

22
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,950
Sir.

23
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,990
She's a mere lowly slave
with a worthless life.

24
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:40,080
All of the officials are not happy about you
having the imperial physicians attend to her.

25
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,760
Why would you get yourself into trouble
for a wretched woman like her?

26
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:46,240
Cai Yuehan.

27
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:49,760
I knew what you did.

28
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,430
During the palace dance,

29
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:55,340
you're the one who placed
the fine needles on the flower platform.

30
00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:00,150
I will let this slide simply because
you are the grand chancellor's daughter.

31
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,950
If you keep pushing your luck,

32
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,950
I will settle all the score with you.

33
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,550
Scram!

34
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,640
Ningyun.

35
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,950
Why are you doing this to me?

36
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:40,129
You'd get to leave

37
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:41,640
if I died, no?

38
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:47,150
Yes.

39
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:51,110
If I died,

40
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:52,569
you knew I'd make your brother

41
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,150
and clan members join me in afterlife.

42
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,240
Why did you put your life at risk

43
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:08,150
to make me feel guilty
for the rest of my life?

44
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:21,960
You can hear me, right?

45
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:25,840
Xiao Ningyun.

46
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:28,510
You will not die on me.

47
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,550
If you died,

48
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,840
I'd sentence your brother to death
by dismemberment.

49
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,009
And I'd turn your clan members
into terracotta figures!

50
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:39,750
Mark my words!

51
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,630
So you must live.

52
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,990
As expected of
Mr. Xu Yunze's subordinate.

53
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:14,369
The soldiers of the Xiao family

54
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:15,800
never yield!

55
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,720
Your wife and child

56
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,510
are in my hands.

57
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:31,400
Think carefully before answering me.

58
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:34,400
Please don't hurt them!

59
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:37,600
Whether they live or perish,

60
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,310
that depends on how sincere you are
in answering my question.

61
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:42,800
Tell me.

62
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:45,759
When Chen Fengxue was
being grounded in the Xiao's Mansion,

63
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,550
what happened
between him and Xiao Ningyun?

64
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,510
Back then,

65
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,510
Chen Fengxue and Miss Ningyun

66
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,160
were lovers.

67
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,430
Chen Fengxue thought Miss Ningyun

68
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:58,800
would elope with him.

69
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,720
Little did he know that Miss Ningyun

70
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,009
would accuse of being a spy

71
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:05,480
who tried to run away.

72
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:07,870
He was then tortured.

73
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,689
Looks like General Chen's obsession
with Xiao Ningyun

74
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,800
is rooted in his hatred towards her.

75
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,600
Xiao Ningyun.

76
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,510
You are not getting

77
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,630
what I can't have.

78
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,430
Sir.

79
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:43,550
Can Mr. Jue Yu save her?

80
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:49,240
This is our only chance.

81
00:07:06,966 --> 00:07:13,100
(Mount Jue Yu)

82
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,670
I, Chen Fengxue,

83
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:41,070
request an audience with you, Master.

84
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:46,040
Master.

85
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,840
Please save Ningyun.

86
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:54,020
(Mount Jue Yu)

87
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:15,519
(Mr. Jue Yu, the master of Chen Fengxue)

88
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,190
If you want to save her,

89
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,600
head to the Revival Spring
behind the mountain.

90
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,600
And make use of
the unique technique I taught you.

91
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,840
No interruption is allowed throughout.

92
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:27,070
If not, your vital energy
will be greatly affected.

93
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:29,159
If your cultivation is depleted,

94
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,190
you will have a hard time to restore it.

95
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:37,910
I will do anything

96
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,030
for her.

97
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:34,600
You rogue!

98
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,030
We've seen each other's bodies before,

99
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,150
no?

100
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,150
I'm injured.

101
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,840
Please pardon me
for sparing the formalities.

102
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,279
Did you know

103
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,440
why I whipped you today?

104
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:17,270
You do as you please.

105
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,889
They're looking for that treasonous spy
all across Southern Chen.

106
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:22,519
Yet you were lingering out there.

107
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,399
If I hadn't interrogated you,

108
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,080
you would've been dead by now.

109
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:30,360
Well,

110
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,560
don't you suspect me?

111
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:34,270
Of course not.

112
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,129
I have faith

113
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:37,110
in my taste.

114
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,560
However,

115
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,360
if you ever lie to me,

116
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,200
I will get rid of you myself.

117
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:45,960
Lie down.

118
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:51,510
Let me tend to your wound.

119
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,840
I don't think that's appropriate.

120
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:59,480
I despise such codes of conduct.

121
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,150
Stay still.

122
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:19,910
Do you still fancy me?

123
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:23,360
Stop being conceited.

124
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,720
If you hate me, why would you
risk your life to save me?

125
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,759
My brother

126
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,969
and clan members

127
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:30,390
are in your hands.

128
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:34,990
Yes.

129
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,200
I still fancy you.

130
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,480
Do you?

131
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,200
You engraved those words on my body

132
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:49,200
and shamed me.

133
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,270
And you're saying you fancy me?

134
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,519
Ningyun.

135
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,560
We'll put the past behind us.

136
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:02,510
Let's stop hating one another, okay?

137
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,630
I know

138
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:09,110
you've been trying to gain my trust.

139
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,249
Listen here.

140
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,440
You've gained my trust.

141
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:17,150
I almost lost my life.

142
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:18,630
So I don't care.

143
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:19,910
Ningyun.

144
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:22,960
I know you said that out of spite.

145
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:50,270
I will prove

146
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,510
that you are my rose-like lover.

147
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,320
What's this?

148
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:27,200
These are

149
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,150
all your clan members.

150
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:30,919
I've issued an order

151
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,439
to grant them with this street.

152
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,790
It's known as Tianyun Street.

153
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,110
From now on,

154
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:38,080
they are no longer sinners and pushovers.

155
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,560
Why are you...

156
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:43,969
I've also released

157
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:45,089
Xiao Zijin and Xu Yunze.

158
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:46,039
Your clan members

159
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,840
are now ordinary folks of Southern Chen.

160
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:50,080
They can live their lives here.

161
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:56,990
Ningyun.

162
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,630
I can give you everything you want.

163
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,840
Could you

164
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:03,030
accept me?
