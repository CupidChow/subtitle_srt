=The Prisoner of Love=

2
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,540
=Episode 21=

3
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:11,680
Give me

4
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,920
some food too.

5
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,950
Who do you think you are?

6
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:20,560
You think I don't know?

7
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,040
You're only keeping me alive
because I'm still useful to you.

8
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,760
Or do you want to starve me to death?

9
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,040
If you don't shut up,

10
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:29,310
I'll beat you up again.

11
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:33,400
These fruits

12
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,400
look sweet.

13
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,070
As soon as Cai Jiuzhang heard

14
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,230
that Qu Xiu had disappeared,

15
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,040
he vanished
from the Grand Chancellor's Mansion.

16
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,590
What should we do now?

17
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,734
It's time to use Qu Xiu.

18
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,310
Have you heard?
The traitor Qu Xiu tried

19
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,040
to give His Majesty evidence
of the Grand Chancellor's collusion

20
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:17,800
with enemy forces,

21
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,470
but he was silenced
by the Grand Chancellor.

22
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,360
Now that the Grand Chancellor
has disappeared,

23
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,310
doesn't that just confirm
he's the traitor?

24
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,630
He might escape,

25
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:27,870
but his family won't.

26
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,590
He committed a crime that merits
the execution of nine relations!

27
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,280
His daughter

28
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,400
is an imperial consort.

29
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:36,680
She will most likely lose her head too.

30
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:39,080
What a world we live in...

31
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,430
How dare that Cai Jiuzhang!

32
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,590
Taking advantage of my youth,

33
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:50,560
he betrayed his nation

34
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,520
for his own gain!

35
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,360
If Uncle hadn't gone to war,

36
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,240
Southern Chen would've lost everything!

37
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,480
After General Chen faked his own death,

38
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,320
the Grand Chancellor attempted
to kill Qu Xiu and cover everything up.

39
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,750
Qu Xiu escaped,
and now the Grand Chancellor is missing.

40
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,360
Uncle's strategy worked perfectly.

41
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,470
He seized Cai Jiuzhang's weakness.

42
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,680
Then, let them fight
each other once more.

43
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,560
As the saying goes,
"The mantis stalks the cicada,

44
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,160
unaware of the oriole behind it."

45
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,520
You know what to do,

46
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:27,800
Shi Ying.

47
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,120
Yes, Your Majesty.

48
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:39,910
Your Majesty.

49
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,190
I just came to see you.

50
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:52,000
If you don't want to die
alongside your father,

51
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,590
you'd better behave.

52
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:55,470
Your Majesty,

53
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,560
my father was just momentarily
blinded by greed!

54
00:04:01,745 --> 00:04:04,712
I have already shown great mercy
by sparing your life.

55
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,470
Lock her in the Cold Palace.
No one is allowed to visit her.

56
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,840
So, you were working
for His Majesty all along.

57
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,710
Let's go.

58
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,190
Cai Jiuzhang!

59
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:35,421
You're finally here!

60
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,630
You had the guts

61
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,600
to lure me here.

62
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,320
Aren't you afraid I'll just kill you
to silence you?

63
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,000
To be honest,

64
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,270
I have

65
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,430
nowhere left to go.

66
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:48,800
How about this?

67
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,920
Give me a sum of money

68
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,750
and help me escape.

69
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,160
If you agree

70
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,430
to my terms,

71
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,240
I'll return all the letters proving
how we conspired

72
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,680
to ignite the feud between
the Xiao and Chen families.

73
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,320
What do you say?

74
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,720
Let me see the letters first.

75
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,950
I can't carry such important documents

76
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,560
with me.

77
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,680
But don't worry.

78
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,270
I've stashed them away

79
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,720
in a very safe place.

80
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,190
Cai Jiuzhang.

81
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,240
You really did come.

82
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,630
You two...

83
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,640
You brought disaster upon our two clans.

84
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,680
Today, I will make you pay for the lives

85
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,360
of our fallen kin!

86
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:30,916
Chen Fengxue!

87
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:32,750
It was your scheme all along!

88
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,950
You're a man!

89
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,600
You can't go back on your word!

90
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,160
You said

91
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,070
that if I helped you

92
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,390
lure this old fox here,

93
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,160
you'd let me go!

94
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,040
He might have agreed to let you go,

95
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:46,630
but I didn't.

96
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:55,510
Chen Fengxue,
did you really think I would come alone?

97
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,510
Did you think I would be

98
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,800
as foolish as him?

99
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,680
Grand Chancellor Cai.
Go ahead, shout as loud as you want.

100
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,000
See if your subordinates

101
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,120
are still there.

102
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,120
What did you do?

103
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:15,520
Just a bit of poison smoke.

104
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,070
Your men are probably

105
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,390
already unconscious.

106
00:06:19,025 --> 00:06:21,600
If you're wise, you'd come with me
to see His Majesty.

107
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,390
In your dreams!

108
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,070
Oh, no.

109
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,940
Looks like another party is closing in.
Let's go.

110
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:56,830
Cai Jiuzhang is dead.

111
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,000
Who do you serve?

112
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:01,149
Are you afraid?

113
00:07:03,534 --> 00:07:04,160
With you,

114
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,512
never.

115
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,160
You must have a death wish!
How dare you turn against us!

116
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:19,390
General Chen.

117
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,630
Go!

118
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,040
After this,

119
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,830
you and I owe each other nothing.

120
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,190
Shi Ying...

121
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,040
Go!

122
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:35,950
Just go!

123
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,630
You're worried about Shi Ying,
aren't you?

124
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,480
I've always seen him

125
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,720
as my own brother.

126
00:08:50,203 --> 00:08:51,440
Even though he betrayed me,

127
00:08:52,021 --> 00:08:55,670
I don't blame him.
We were all just pieces on the board,

128
00:08:58,378 --> 00:08:59,360
carrying out our orders.

129
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,750
He saved you

130
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,589
not to make you feel guilty

131
00:09:05,214 --> 00:09:06,625
but so you could live on.

132
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:11,105
I understand.

133
00:09:12,465 --> 00:09:15,447
But the one who wants us dead this time
won't be easy to deal with.

134
00:09:17,796 --> 00:09:18,843
You know who they are?

135
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:23,585
But I refuse to believe it.

136
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,720
If I don't make it...

137
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,000
No.

138
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,600
If you die,

139
00:09:32,414 --> 00:09:33,510
then I'll die with you.

140
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,440
General Chen.

141
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,080
General Chen!

142
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,440
He told me to meet him here.

143
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:43,390
You're here.

144
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,150
You scared me!

145
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,790
How did you find us?

146
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,910
General Chen left a trail along the way.
Luckily, I ran into Mr. Xu.

147
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,080
This place isn't safe.

148
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,840
Let's go meet up with Mr. Xu..

149
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:58,870
Come on.

150
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:00,910
Let's go.

151
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:06,750
Mr. Xu.

152
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,550
Looks like

153
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,120
you're ready to lay siege

154
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,200
to the imperial city.

155
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:15,200
We have you to thank for the map
of the mountain range on the outskirts.

156
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,870
Now that Southern Chen has lost you
and Cai Jiuzhang,

157
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:19,910
there's only the emperor left.

158
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:21,630
Why wouldn't we attack?

159
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:22,960
The emperor isn't as easy

160
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,670
to deal with as you think.

161
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,150
Xu Yunze.

162
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,910
I have already avenged
my father and mother.

163
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,440
The enemy who instigated the feud
between our two clans

164
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,760
has been slain by my own hands.

165
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,030
There's no meaning

166
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:35,910
in fighting any longer.

167
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,440
If we win,

168
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,320
the people suffer.

169
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:39,630
If we lose,

170
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:40,630
the people suffer.

171
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:41,670
But Miss Xiao...

172
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:42,750
No matter what,

173
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,150
I will not take part in this war.

174
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,270
I want to see a world where the people
no longer suffer from war.

175
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,550
You don't have to take part.

176
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:53,870
I will shed my last drop of blood

177
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,150
for you

178
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,600
and for the Xiao clan.

179
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,750
And who are you

180
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,840
to shed your blood for my woman?

181
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,150
As a guard of Xiao?

182
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,390
What did you say?

183
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:04,750
Xu Yunze.

184
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,960
I don't want to see anyone

185
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,790
fighting for me.

186
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:11,080
Nor do I wish to see anyone fighting

187
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:11,840
because of me.

188
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,240
I only wish for the Xiao clan

189
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,000
to live in peace and prosperity.

190
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,600
I hope you understand.

191
00:12:44,312 --> 00:12:47,320
I provoked Xu Yunze on purpose.
It wasn't to humiliate him.

192
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,720
I don't want him

193
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,080
to throw his life away
in a futile fight.

194
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,360
My nephew is not

195
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:53,720
to be underestimated.

196
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,720
I know you're doing this

197
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:57,720
for me.

198
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,200
And so is Xu Yunze.

199
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,000
I have nothing more to say.

200
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,750
I believe he will make

201
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:08,440
the right choice.

202
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,720
Let's set out tomorrow.

203
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,040
What are you doing here?

204
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,440
I want to talk to you.
