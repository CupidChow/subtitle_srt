00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,540
=Episode 14=

3
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,600
Xiao Ningyun.

4
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:56,560
Have I ever been in your heart?

5
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,350
Have I?

6
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,200
Answer me!

7
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,230
He's about to die.

8
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:18,200
At least let him die knowing the truth.

9
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:20,000
What do you say?

10
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,120
No.

11
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,200
I never loved you.

12
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:29,560
Only hatred remains.

13
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:36,840
Xiao Ningyun.

14
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,230
You truly are heartless.

15
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:41,840
Since that's the case,

16
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,150
then come down.

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,070
Give me one final strike.

18
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,590
Interesting.

19
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,480
Very well.

20
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,640
My uncle has made his request.

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,400
So naturally, I shall grant it.

22
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,680
Xiao Ningyun.

23
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,590
I told you my life was yours,

24
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,310
in life and in death.

25
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,590
Even if I die by your hand today,

26
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,030
it will not be in vain.

27
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,240
The Xiao clan treated them with honor.

28
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,280
(Xiao family's guard)
Yet some harbored ill intentions,

29
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,710
stealing the defense map.

30
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,030
What was their motive?

31
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,710
Chen Fengxue.

32
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,080
Tell me,

33
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,190
who was it?

34
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,080
I don't know.

35
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:49,560
You don't know?

36
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:50,750
Guards!

37
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:51,910
Strike him.

38
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,080
Stop!

39
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:56,360
Miss Ningyun.

40
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,590
Yesterday, Chen Fengxue was

41
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,800
with me the entire time.

42
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,400
He couldn't have stolen the map.

43
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:04,710
I'm taking him with me.

44
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,120
If Father holds anyone accountable,

45
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,310
I take full responsibility.

46
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,150
Miss Ningyun.

47
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,190
Do you not understand?

48
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,240
Listen carefully.

49
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,030
Chen Fengxue's life

50
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,800
belongs to me, Xiao Ningyun.

51
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,280
My mother left me

52
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,430
this jade pendant.

53
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:29,710
I'm giving it to you.

54
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:42,910
Do you like it?

55
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:45,750
I do.

56
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:47,470
Chen Fengxue.

57
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,870
If you stay true to me,

58
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:50,840
I promise

59
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,190
I will care for you forever.

60
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,360
I will be loyal to you.

61
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,280
No matter life or death,

62
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:56,430
I am yours.

63
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,080
Xiao Ningyun.

64
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:11,000
I told you my life was yours.

65
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,750
In life and in death.

66
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,070
Even if I die by your hand today,

67
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,510
it will not be in vain.

68
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,480
Chen Fengxue.

69
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,560
Do you think

70
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,480
I would hesitate?

71
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,750
Xiao Ningyun.

72
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,950
I knew you wouldn't waver.

73
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,920
Protect His Majesty!

74
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,160
Protect His Majesty!

75
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,750
Protect His Majesty!

76
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,120
Protect His Majesty! Hurry!

77
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,870
Guard His Majesty!

78
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:04,360
Hurry!

79
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,800
Protect His Majesty!

80
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:06,830
Guard His Majesty!

81
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,040
Come with me!

82
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:11,680
General.

83
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,390
Hang in there, General.

84
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:16,510
General.

85
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,000
General!

86
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:18,720
General!

87
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,160
General!

88
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,000
Stay with us!

89
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,160
Where is Ningyun now?

90
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
She shouldn't be

91
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,800
your concern now!

92
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,750
There's no news of her capture yet.

93
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:34,750
General.

94
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,480
This is a huge mess!

95
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,560
Why are you here?

96
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:47,800
Believe it or not,

97
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,630
I never intended for him to die.

98
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,560
Otherwise, I wouldn't have

99
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,390
had someone impersonate Xiao Zijin
to take the blame.

100
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,800
I just hope he can survive this.

101
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,480
This ordeal

102
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,160
is a beauty's curse.

103
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,630
Who knows if the general

104
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:07,950
will make it through this one.

105
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,240
What do you mean?

106
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,000
Back when he was poisoned,

107
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,360
I could at least suppress it.

108
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,120
But now, with these severe injuries,

109
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,000
I can't counteract the poison.

110
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,430
Even if his wounds heal,

111
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,560
this poison will still claim his life.

112
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:35,920
Miss Xiao.

113
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,270
It's safe here.

114
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,680
You should rest for the night.

115
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,950
Tomorrow, we meet

116
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:41,040
the clan at the border.

117
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:43,120
Why were you at the hunting grounds?

118
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,630
That couldn't have been a coincidence.

119
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,000
I...

120
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,070
Don't tell me

121
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:50,070
you escaped from the General's Mansion,

122
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:52,240
and infiltrated the heavily
guarded hunting grounds.

123
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:53,920
Miss Xiao, it's best not to ask.

124
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,390
By tomorrow, we'll be free.

125
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,360
Unless you tell me,

126
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:58,920
I won't go with you.

127
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,000
This...

128
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,160
It was all Chen Fengxue's plan.

129
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,160
You're really letting me go?

130
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:17,800
Take it as repayment

131
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,830
for helping me escape blame

132
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,360
by faking Xiao Zijin's rescue.

133
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:22,720
Is that all?

134
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,270
His Majesty agreed

135
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:27,950
to release Xiao Ningyun

136
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,680
if I entered the hunting grounds,

137
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,960
But I suspect

138
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,030
that I am the prey.

139
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,270
You want me to rescue you there?

140
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,480
You were there to save someone,

141
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,270
but not me.

142
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:43,750
You're saving Xiao Ningyun.

143
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,390
This is her only chance.

144
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:47,960
You want to save Miss Xiao?

145
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,240
Why should I trust you?

146
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:51,750
You're a prisoner.

147
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:55,120
And Xiao Ningyun is trapped
in the palace with no way out.

148
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,670
Apart from trusting me,

149
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,550
what choice do you have?

150
00:08:59,440 --> 00:08:59,960
Tomorrow,

151
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:02,150
someone will get you
into the hunting grounds.

152
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,150
Just rescue Xiao Ningyun.

153
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,440
What if I kill you?

154
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,510
If I die, none of you will escape.

155
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,630
You wouldn't gamble with Ningyun's life.

156
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:11,360
Chen Fengxue.

157
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:12,360
Why...

158
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,000
Xu Yunze.

159
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:14,790
Take her away.

160
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:15,750
Keep her safe.

161
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,790
Never return.

162
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,720
(Chen Fengxue...)

163
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,510
(Fate always separates us.)

164
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,390
(We're destined to part ways.)

165
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,910
(You must live on.)

166
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,080
(You have to.)

167
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,870
Ningyun?

168
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,910
Chen Fengxue!

169
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,870
You said your life was mine.

170
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,360
I will have you die now!

171
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:26,600
I hate you.

172
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,270
I hate you to the bones!

173
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,360
Ningyun...

174
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:37,630
General.

175
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:39,150
General!

176
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,000
How is the general?

177
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:50,870
General...

178
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,390
I'm afraid he won't make it.

179
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,550
I'll administer the medicine now.

180
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,000
This will pierce his glabella.

181
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,360
If he doesn't wake up,

182
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,120
then he is...

183
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,360
Hurry!

184
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,270
General!

185
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:23,840
General!

186
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:24,790
General!
