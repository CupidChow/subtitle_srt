=The Prisoner of Love=

2
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,540
=Episode 17=

3
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,250
Chen Fengxue!

4
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:50,420
I knew

5
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:51,899
the cunning general

6
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,250
wouldn't die so easily.

7
00:00:58,470 --> 00:00:59,970
Your hair...

8
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,370
Miss Xiao.

9
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:07,980
Are you worried about me?

10
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:10,090
I...

11
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:14,269
I merely asked

12
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:15,900
because you took care

13
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,299
of me.

14
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,450
Xiao Ningyun.

15
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,869
You don't actually think I saved you

16
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:22,530
because I still love you, do you?

17
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,700
Xu Yunze captured the physician.

18
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:29,620
I just happened to return

19
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:31,290
to seek treatment from him.

20
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:33,010
Who do you think you are?

21
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:37,140
That's right.

22
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:40,370
After all, it was I who delivered

23
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,570
the final strike.

24
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,780
I'm glad you remember.

25
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,370
You and I will only

26
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,810
ever be enemies in this lifetime.

27
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:52,099
Then why didn't you kill me

28
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,260
when I was blind?

29
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,370
It's far more entertaining

30
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,730
to toy with you than to simply kill you.

31
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,260
I didn't even need to use sweet words.

32
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,570
I merely stayed by your side
for a few days,

33
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,180
and now you come running to me
in the middle of the night.

34
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:09,410
Pathetic.

35
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,060
Chen Fengxue.

36
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,810
If it is death you seek,

37
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,180
then it is death I deny.

38
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,220
Miss Xiao.

39
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,059
General Chen's body is failing.

40
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:51,059
His organs are deteriorating.

41
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,109
He poses no threat to you.

42
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,650
There's no need for you to stay here.

43
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,339
Why is he

44
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,780
so weak?

45
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,970
Because of you.

46
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:02,389
Me?

47
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,229
What are you saying?

48
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:04,300
What do you mean?

49
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,499
It may have been caused

50
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,130
by taking the feigned death drug.

51
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:14,669
- Why would he fake his death?
- That was General Chen's decision.

52
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:16,580
As his subordinate,
I do not question his orders.

53
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,739
I only hope you two

54
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,989
can coexist peacefully

55
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:21,370
and focus on your own recoveries.

56
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:22,900
Physician.

57
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:24,220
Physician!

58
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:44,740
Here we go!

59
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,459
The medicine's here.

60
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,499
Miss Xiao.

61
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,779
You haven't fully recovered.

62
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,020
You must take your medicine.

63
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:53,850
Physician.

64
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,109
Did Chen Fengxue

65
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,970
raise red worms?

66
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,149
I already told you.

67
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,620
No.

68
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,930
You brought this book with you.

69
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:07,019
It says

70
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,429
that those who raise red worms

71
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,619
will suffer

72
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,970
total organ failure.

73
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:12,930
That sounds a lot like
what you said yesterday.

74
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,499
Even if you ask me a hundred times,

75
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,820
my answer remains the same.

76
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,410
No.

77
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:19,499
You won't talk?

78
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,290
Fine.

79
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,530
I'll ask him myself.

80
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,290
You called me pathetic.

81
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,580
But the truly pathetic one is you.

82
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,610
If I'm not mistaken,

83
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,650
the one who raised the worms

84
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,410
is you.

85
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:46,970
When it comes to delusion,

86
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:49,050
no one surpasses you, Miss Xiao.

87
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,490
Obey or be punished.

88
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:56,260
You were once imprisoned
and tortured in Xiao's Mansion.

89
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:58,290
You should know

90
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,029
about the wax torture there,

91
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,410
shouldn't you?

92
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,020
Strip him!

93
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,469
You can't do this!

94
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:07,410
You mustn't!

95
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,020
Still won't talk?

96
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,020
I have

97
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,850
nothing to say.

98
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,610
Let's see how long you can last.

99
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,730
Get me ten candles!

100
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,220
Here are two worms.

101
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,379
Have her take the first worm
to sustain her life.

102
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,909
Once I fully cultivate the red worm,

103
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:59,640
let her take the second
to cure her poison.

104
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:01,850
Have you lost your mind?

105
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:03,600
You just took the feigned death drug.

106
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,499
Don't you know why your hair turned white?

107
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,460
And now you want to use your blood
to raise the worm and save her? Why?

108
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,820
Now I know.

109
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,650
She does love me.

110
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,029
But don't forget.

111
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:14,619
She was the one who crippled your legs,

112
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,549
made you suffer,

113
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:17,059
and poisoned her blood for you to take.

114
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,699
Using your blood to cultivate the worm
can cure her poison, but you...

115
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,780
My mind is made up.

116
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,050
I hated her

117
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:24,290
because she deceived me.

118
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:26,610
But now I know she loves me.

119
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:29,720
She was willing to be buried in a place
where she can still see me.

120
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:30,940
That's enough.

121
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:33,970
But if you try to raise the worm
in your current state,

122
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:36,580
your organs will fail, and you will die!

123
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,170
So please, keep this secret for me.

124
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,090
Don't let her know

125
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,700
that I am the one raising the worm.

126
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,610
Sir,

127
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,090
if you don't tell her,

128
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,220
she will hate you forever!

129
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:52,640
I would rather she hates me
for the rest of her life

130
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,970
than grieves for eternity.

131
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,530
We have already

132
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,050
missed too much.

133
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,610
I only wish that in our next life,

134
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:03,900
we won't miss each other again.

135
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:08,650
Miss Xiao.

136
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,050
Miss Xiao.

137
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:17,050
Even if you don't kill him,

138
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,530
you must not involve yourself
with him any further.

139
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,440
The new leader of the Xiao clan
has gathered the remnants of our forces.

140
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,490
They will arrive tomorrow.

141
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,410
They plan to take advantage

142
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:28,320
of General Chen's supposed death
to take revenge on the Nanchen Emperor.

143
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,850
Do not underestimate this emperor.

144
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:32,410
He is not someone to be caged.

145
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:33,730
Miss Xiao.

146
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,970
You tortured Chen Fengxue on purpose,
didn't you?

147
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,780
You're afraid

148
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,940
that if you let him go,

149
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,610
he will be hunted down by the emperor

150
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:43,939
and our people

151
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,109
now that he has lost

152
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:45,940
his power.

153
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:47,730
You're also afraid...

154
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:48,850
Silence!

155
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:01,850
Chen Fengxue.

156
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,109
You never imagined

157
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,349
you would one day fall

158
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:06,940
into my hands, did you?

159
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,290
I did think I might die by your hands.

160
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:13,050
But I never thought

161
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,020
you wouldn't have the heart to kill me.

162
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,820
Are you trying to provoke me
into killing you?

163
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,650
I won't.

164
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:24,170
You can't bring yourself to kill me,
Xiao Ningyun.

165
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,260
Stop lying to yourself.

166
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,619
If you want to relive the past,

167
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,820
it's simple.

168
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,700
Stop saying one thing and doing another.

169
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,619
Relive the past?

170
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,010
In your current state?

171
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,460
Are you sure?

172
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,340
If you beg me now,

173
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:51,770
I might let you go.

174
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,770
I saved you from the hunting grounds

175
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:57,940
just to settle our debts.

176
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,989
I drank your blood to stay alive.

177
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,490
Now I return the favor.

178
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:03,970
I beg you.

179
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,370
I beg you to stop
being so self-righteous.

180
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,970
That's right.

181
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:10,370
You drank

182
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,060
so much of my blood.

183
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,300
Now it's my turn to drain yours.

184
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:18,890
Blood for blood.

185
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:25,090
Fine.

186
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:26,730
I'll return it all

187
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,180
to you.

188
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:52,850
Miss Xiao.

189
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,850
The elders have arrived.

190
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:07,460
Stop!

191
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,940
Who are you to deal
with my captive as you please?

192
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,309
Chen Fengxue and the Xiao clan

193
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:17,250
are sworn enemies!

194
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,949
His hands are stained

195
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:20,659
with the blood of the Xiao clan!

196
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,779
Fate decides who lives and dies
in the battle for power.

197
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,610
You will not dispose of him
at your will!

198
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,739
The rumors are true, after all.

199
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:28,949
You still have

200
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:30,779
feelings for him.

201
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:31,490
You...

202
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:32,989
Miss Ningyun,

203
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:34,709
are you really going
to betray the Xiao clan

204
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:36,229
for this wretch?

205
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:37,340
It's not like that.

206
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,180
Miss Ningyun is only keeping him alive

207
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,540
because he is still useful.

208
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,090
You don't know

209
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,660
how he tortured me.

210
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,580
I want to keep him alive

211
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,130
and take my time

212
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,060
to torture him.

213
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:20,580
You were willing

214
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:23,300
to stand against the Xiao clan for me.

215
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,970
And you still claim
you have no feelings left for me?

216
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,250
If you haven't forgotten me,

217
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,619
I don't mind

218
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,090
indulging you.

219
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:38,619
I had them

220
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:39,989
spare you

221
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,820
so I could torture you.

222
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,490
Miss Xiao,

223
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:48,180
admit it.

224
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,970
You can't bear to let me go.

225
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:51,970
No matter how much I humiliate you,

226
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:53,829
no matter how cruel my words,

227
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:56,340
you are so pathetic
that you can't let me go.

228
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:57,940
Very well.

229
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:00,130
Let's find out

230
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:02,130
whether it's you

231
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:04,130
who still has lingering feelings for me

232
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,580
or if I'm the one

233
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,700
who can't let go of you.

234
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,180
Chen Fengxue,

235
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,949
listen up.

236
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,309
Our entangled torment will last

237
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:16,610
until our last breath!
