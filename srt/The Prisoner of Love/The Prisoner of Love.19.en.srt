00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:39,220
=The Prisoner of Love=

2
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,540
=Episode 19=

3
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,920
I thought that if we ever met again,
we would be enemies.

4
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:59,030
We are enemies.

5
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:01,150
But I once said

6
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,880
that I would repay

7
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:03,710
your kindness.

8
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,840
You helped me before.

9
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:07,680
Our debts

10
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:08,790
were already settled.

11
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,920
First, you found my younger brother
who died on the battlefield

12
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:13,790
and gave him

13
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,280
a proper burial.

14
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,440
Second, when I was ambushed
and on the brink of death,

15
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,350
you saved me.

16
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:20,920
Third,

17
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,310
you restored my family's ancestral tomb.

18
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,200
You are someone who distinguishes
between gratitude and grudges.

19
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:28,760
I trust you.

20
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,430
If you trust me,

21
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:31,640
then why have you returned?

22
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:34,950
I never expected

23
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,480
to keep this secret for long.

24
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,200
Since they already suspect something,
I might as well take the initiative.

25
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:43,590
But still,

26
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:45,640
thank you for the warning.

27
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,590
I advise you
to leave Daliang City at once.

28
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,200
Don't get caught up
in this turmoil any longer.

29
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,750
I can't hold my liquor.

30
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,720
I must retire to my room.

31
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:13,150
Miss Ningyun.

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,520
Miss Ningyun?

33
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,400
Let me help you back to your room.

34
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,520
All right.

35
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,430
Mr. Xu.

36
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:32,400
You should go

37
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,710
to sleep too.

38
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:34,120
I...

39
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,190
I'm retiring for the night too.

40
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:37,430
Yes.

41
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,310
Mr. Xu...

42
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,880
What are you doing here?

43
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:55,310
I'm here to tell you
that Cai Jiuzhang already knows

44
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,520
that General Chen is alive.

45
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,400
His Majesty will find this location soon.
It's not safe for you to stay here.

46
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,920
I know the Xiao clan's objective
in acquiring the mountain range map.

47
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,030
But you will not succeed.

48
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:09,960
You will only waste your lives.

49
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,880
And what position do you have
to say these things to me?

50
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,120
I have no position.

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,520
General Chen entrusted you
with the mountain range map.

52
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,030
If you rebel,

53
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,030
you will implicate him

54
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,470
and have him accused of treason.

55
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:28,430
Did Chen Fengxue send you
to tell me this?

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,310
No one sent me.

57
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,360
I just wanted you to know this.

58
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,760
I hope that after hearing them,

59
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,630
you will consider his well-being.

60
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,960
He has never forgotten you.

61
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,680
Even though you hurt him deeply,

62
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,080
he was still willing to stand against

63
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,150
all of Southern Chen to protect you.

64
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,470
My arms are sore from all the whipping.

65
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,680
Why are you still not confessing?

66
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,430
Do you think
that if you keep your mouth shut,

67
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,120
we won't be able

68
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,680
to find proof of your treason?

69
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:11,030
No matter how you torture me,
I won't say a word.

70
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,750
Still so stubborn, even as a prisoner.

71
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,720
I'll be back after I've rested tomorrow
to flay your skin!

72
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,800
Sooner or later,

73
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,390
you'll admit that you're a spy!

74
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,480
General Chen.

75
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,430
I was sent to rescue you.

76
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,120
Please bear with it.

77
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,920
Grand Chancellor has presented irrefutable
evidence of the Xiao clan's rebellion.

78
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,520
Which of you is prepared
to lead the effort to quell it?

79
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,390
I

80
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,390
will go.

81
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:02,950
Granted.

82
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,510
Shi Ying.

83
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:26,070
Issue my order.
Dispatch our men to Xiao's Mansion

84
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,800
and offer them a chance to surrender.

85
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,630
We've surrounded the Xiao's Mansion.

86
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,920
You could order the slaughter

87
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,660
of the entire Xiao clan
with a single command.

88
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,630
Why waste time negotiating with them?

89
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,440
(I told her I'd return to marry her.)

90
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,160
(But now, things have come to this.)

91
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,190
(If I don't oversee this myself,)

92
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,600
(the entire Xiao clan
will be wiped out.)

93
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,080
(No matter what, I must protect her.)

94
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:49,156
Sir?

95
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,720
Do I need to explain

96
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,494
my decisions to you?

97
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,240
I object!

98
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,440
We have them completely surrounded.

99
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,040
If they resist,

100
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,680
it would be as easy as crushing ants.

101
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,560
Why waste time with diplomacy?

102
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,560
General Chen was a hostage
in the Xiao clan for years.

103
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,070
Has he grown attached

104
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,070
to them?

105
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,430
Please issue the order
for an immediate attack.

106
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:13,680
If word spreads

107
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,430
that you are hesitating,

108
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,750
it won't bode well for you or any of us
when His Majesty hears of it.

109
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,440
There is no need for haste.

110
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:26,430
Before I came, I had a private
discussion with His Majesty.

111
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:30,040
His Majesty said he wishes
to be remembered as a benevolent ruler.

112
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,630
My actions

113
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:32,830
are merely

114
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:33,750
helping him

115
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:34,870
build that reputation.

116
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,680
Sir!

117
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,390
Sir!

118
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,112
You are showing symptoms of poisoning!

119
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,070
Poisoning?

120
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,160
How could I be poisoned?

121
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:03,320
Miss Xiao refused to hand over
the Thousand Snow Pill.

122
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,360
She even took the only one in existence
under the pretense

123
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,240
of strengthening her body.

124
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,305
I suspect she poisoned you.

125
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,425
How else could it be such a coincidence
that General Chen was suddenly poisoned

126
00:07:13,425 --> 00:07:15,160
just as we prepared
to attack the Xiao clan?

127
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,301
And the only cure is something
only she possesses.

128
00:07:19,578 --> 00:07:20,920
There's no point

129
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,087
discussing that now.

130
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,800
This poison

131
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:26,070
cannot be completely purged.

132
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,430
I can only suppress it

133
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:29,870
with my cultivation.

134
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:33,190
But most likely, this will leave

135
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,480
his legs permanently crippled.

136
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,720
He was never the enemy
who destroyed your clan.

137
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:56,000
He was the one who nearly lost his life
trying to protect you.

138
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,070
So that's how he got that scar

139
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,480
on his collarbone.

140
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,190
No wonder he said

141
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,630
that his crippled legs
were because of me.

142
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,950
But I truly didn't know.

143
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,800
I did take the Thousand Snow Pill.

144
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,750
But I swear,

145
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,560
I never knew he had asked me for it!

146
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:24,830
Miss Xiao.

147
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,600
You have no idea how much

148
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,120
he has suffered over the years.

149
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,510
You tricked him into running away together,
and he was overjoyed.

150
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,120
But in the end,

151
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:37,910
he was betrayed
by the woman he loved most.

152
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:39,480
I...

153
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,440
I didn't betray him.

154
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,000
I truly wanted

155
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,320
to escape with him back then.

156
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,000
But I fell ill.

157
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,510
When I woke up,

158
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,360
they told me that he had defected
and escaped from Xiao's Mansion.

159
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,720
I thought he had lied

160
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,790
to me...

161
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,880
I cannot judge
who is right or wrong between you two.

162
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,670
I only hope that now
that you know the truth,

163
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,550
you won't drag him down with you.

164
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,840
General Chen is gone!

165
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,480
Find him!

166
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,510
These guards are useless!

167
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,150
They actually let that jerk run away.

168
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,680
What do we do now?

169
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,920
We should've killed him
when we had the chance!

170
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,320
Calm down. I've already had Mr. Xu
sent men to track him down.

171
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:35,760
We will get to the bottom of this.

172
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,390
Yunze.

173
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,630
Do me a favor.

174
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:08,510
They've found him.
We'll split up and catch him.
