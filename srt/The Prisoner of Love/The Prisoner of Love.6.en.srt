=The Prisoner of Love=

2
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,540
=Episode 6=

3
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,880
What are you trying to do?

4
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,670
Do I still get

5
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,320
the chance

6
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,350
to tempt you?

7
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:02,470
I'd like to see what you're capable of.

8
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,000
General Chen.

9
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:35,560
Your heart is racing.

10
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,760
There are many reasons
for an accelerated heartbeat.

11
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,840
I wonder which one it is for you?

12
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:49,070
Excitement?

13
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,560
Nervousness?

14
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,280
Or affection?

15
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,310
Xiao Ningyun.
You are not worthy of kissing me.

16
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,520
Let alone using such disgraceful tricks

17
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,520
to win my trust.

18
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:12,240
Men!

19
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,680
What a difficult man to deal with.

20
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,360
Sir, it's time for your medicine.

21
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,080
I'm not getting any better
no matter how much I take.

22
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,590
What's behind

23
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,520
this sudden interest?

24
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,680
Back in the Xiao Mansion,

25
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,710
bamboo leaf cake

26
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,080
was your favorite.

27
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,360
This mansion doesn't have it.

28
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:23,630
I figured you haven't had it
in a long time,

29
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,280
so I took the liberty of
making some for you.

30
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,800
It's funny, really.

31
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,520
General Chen and I must be fated.

32
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,400
His favorite food just happens to be
the one I'm best at making.

33
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,430
(Back then, I only ate it every day)

34
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,520
(because it was the only thing
she knew how to make.)

35
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,240
(Thinking about it now,
it's ridiculous.)

36
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,080
Fate?

37
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,680
If we're talking
about ill-fated entanglements,

38
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,150
then yes, we are deeply connected.

39
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,360
Miss Xiao.

40
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,360
Tell me.
What game are you playing this time?

41
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,880
Enduring humiliation for revenge?

42
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,310
You jest.

43
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,360
I've simply thought things through.

44
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,280
I've decided to stay by your side

45
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,960
as a loyal dog,

46
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,190
wagging my tail just to make you happy.

47
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,360
You cooked for me.

48
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,750
How do you want me to thank you?

49
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,390
Let you see Xiao Zijin?

50
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,390
I'll grant you this request only once.

51
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,040
That won't be necessary.
Seeing him will only bring more sorrow.

52
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:52,630
Good.

53
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:53,920
Very good.

54
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:03,600
It tastes

55
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:04,680
just as I remembered.

56
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,270
Back then,

57
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,920
you used to tidy my hair like this too.

58
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,630
Didn't expect you

59
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:25,950
to still remember.

60
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,480
How could I forget?

61
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,750
I had the butler buy this.

62
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,750
A little gift for you.

63
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,720
White-glazed inkstone

64
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,510
is the smoothest to use.

65
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,000
Back when I was confined

66
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,800
in the Xiao Mansion,

67
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,630
I lacked bare necessities.

68
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,680
Even my inkstone

69
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,120
was broken and leaked ink.

70
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,160
Do you remember

71
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,360
what you said to me back then?

72
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,040
Yes.

73
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,800
I said that

74
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,680
with such beautiful handwriting,

75
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,040
it was a shame for you
to use a broken inkstone.

76
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:29,830
So, I gave you a new one.
And I didn't allow you to refuse.

77
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,360
I was

78
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,390
too brazen back then.

79
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,560
If I offended you,

80
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,240
I hope you can forgive me.

81
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,750
If it weren't for you back then,

82
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,160
I wouldn't even have been able

83
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,310
to read and write.

84
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,440
Much less have anything
to pass the time with.

85
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,560
Aren't you coming in
to serve me while I bathe?

86
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:36,400
What's the matter?

87
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,150
Don't you know how
to serve someone in a bath?

88
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,040
Even after all these years,

89
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,270
your scars are still there.

90
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,320
Do you remember

91
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,840
who gave me

92
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,030
these scars?

93
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,640
I wouldn't dare forget.

94
00:09:30,984 --> 00:09:32,494
How thoughtful of you to remember.

95
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,600
I remember our past

96
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,910
so vividly.

97
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,960
I did make mistakes back then.

98
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:46,960
But at least

99
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,360
we didn't miss each other.

100
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,390
I'm pleased with your recent behavior.

101
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,120
This is your reward.

102
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,720
Ningyun!

103
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,150
Come here.

104
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,910
What I like most about you

105
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,630
is your hair.

106
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,550
Chen Fengxue!
One can be killed, but not humiliated!

107
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,790
Get your filthy hands off my sister!

108
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,270
Does your brother

109
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,680
have some misunderstanding about you?

110
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,270
Or is it about me?

111
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:01,200
Last time,
Xu Yunze broke into my mansion.

112
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,840
Your sister was so afraid
I'd misunderstand,

113
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,510
she even stabbed him in the chest.

114
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,240
Ningyun, you…

115
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,510
Xiao Zijin.

116
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,480
Stop being so naive.

117
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,510
What's wrong with adapting
in order to survive?

118
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:20,790
Ningyun.

119
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:23,510
Your unyielding pride
is the pride of the entire Xiao family!

120
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,030
Ningyun, you once told me

121
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,120
to be strong.

122
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:26,910
To be…

123
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:27,840
Silence.

124
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:30,630
Forget everything I said

125
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:31,910
in the past.

126
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,270
General Chen.

127
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,440
I don't want to see a coward like him.

128
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:43,320
From now on,

129
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,480
you are no longer my sister!

130
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:55,790
Don't worry.

131
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:58,120
I will let Xiao Zijin go.

132
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,510
General Chen.

133
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:02,630
You…

134
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:04,440
Ningyun.

135
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:08,000
If I wanted to keep you by my side,

136
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:09,750
I wouldn't use force.

137
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,030
I'd use my heart.

138
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,720
General Chen.

139
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,120
You remember?

140
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:20,480
Thief!

141
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,520
Stop right there!

142
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,360
Chen Fengxue?

143
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:30,750
You…

144
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,000
I'm being accused for no reason.
I have to leave this place.

145
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,150
Well,

146
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,440
will you come back?

147
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,270
You've caught me.

148
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,910
You can do as you please with me.

149
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:53,960
I told you.

150
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,910
I like you.

151
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,790
I will get you out of here.

152
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,480
If you try

153
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,600
to climb over that wall,

154
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,080
and you're caught,

155
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,240
you'll be punished severely.

156
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,840
Chen Fengxue.

157
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:08,270
I told you.

158
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,960
If I want to keep you by my side,

159
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,360
I won't use force.

160
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,200
I'll use my heart.

161
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:23,670
Ningyun.

162
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:27,120
You still have feelings for me,
don't you?

163
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,240
I remember our past

164
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,150
so vividly.

165
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,840
I meant every word I said.

166
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,550
But how much

167
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,720
are your words really worth?
