00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:39,220
=The Prisoner of Love=

2
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,540
=Episode 24=

3
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,080
You came all the way here, Your Majesty.

4
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,840
Please pardon me
for my lack of hospitality.

5
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:57,640
Uncle, since it's your wedding day,

6
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,350
of course

7
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,480
I needed to make my way here
to congratulate you.

8
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:06,280
The great general of Southern Chen
is marrying a treasonous slave.

9
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:10,560
He has attempted a rebellion
with the remnant of the Xiao family.

10
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,400
He is sentenced to death row.

11
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:15,200
Fengxue.

12
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:20,040
I wonder if you are happy

13
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:23,000
with this wedding gift, Uncle.

14
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,400
Your Majesty, you wouldn't have

15
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,430
to go this far to capture me.

16
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,000
In fact,

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,350
I wanted to go to you.

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,840
Uncle,

19
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:41,710
your absolute confidence

20
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:43,480
is nothing but hateful.

21
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:46,230
Take him away!

22
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,760
Fengxue.

23
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,590
You are pretty popular.

24
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,710
Many have spoken up for you.

25
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,280
You could've killed me in town.

26
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,440
Why didn't you do so?

27
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,280
What do you think?

28
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,310
Well,

29
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,440
you were afraid
both of your attempts would fail.

30
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,590
Thus, you changed the strategy
by making me admit to the crime.

31
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,590
You'd then execute me

32
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,430
as a warning to all.

33
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,240
As expected of you, Uncle.

34
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:52,630
Your Majesty.
Things have ended up this way

35
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,590
for us both.

36
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,030
Looks like there's nothing else to say

37
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,870
to one another.

38
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,840
There's no need to say it out loud.

39
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,750
Since you're aware of my intention,

40
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:12,680
you should be smart
and I shall grant you a quick death.

41
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:16,080
And I will show mercy on Xiao Ningyun.

42
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:17,400
Guards.

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,680
Bring Xiao Ningyun in.

44
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,520
Fengxue!

45
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,710
Ningyun!

46
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:24,680
Fengxue.

47
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,120
Are you all right?

48
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,150
Uncle, you ever told me

49
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,360
that one doesn't need
many tricks up his sleeve.

50
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,760
As long as what he has work.

51
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,240
Well, does this

52
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:39,840
work?

53
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,840
Chen Fengxue.

54
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,400
If you pen a confession because of me,

55
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,680
I will look down on you

56
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,430
for the rest of my life.

57
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,190
Don't touch her!

58
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,280
Your Majesty,

59
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:53,560
I never taught you

60
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,000
such lowly tricks as hitting a woman.

61
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,870
Don't anger me.
Because it doesn't work.

62
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,150
Just kill us!

63
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,590
We shall die together.

64
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,150
We will never die.

65
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,720
Instead, we will be together forever.

66
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,120
Uncle.

67
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,310
Aren't you afraid I will get rid of her?

68
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,750
You will not do so.

69
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,680
It's because you know

70
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,720
that if you kill her,

71
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,560
I will get rid of you

72
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,000
even if it costs my life.

73
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,070
As long as she lives,

74
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,870
you will make her

75
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,830
bargaining chip.

76
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,560
Lunatics.

77
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,480
You're all lunatics.

78
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:57,870
(Just kill us!)

79
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,480
(We shall die together.)

80
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,190
(We will never die.)

81
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,920
(Instead, we will be together forever.)

82
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,680
From the beginning of time,

83
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,310
an emperor is always lonely.

84
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,830
Well,

85
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,390
will I ever have someone
who treats me sincerely?

86
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,680
Believe it or not,

87
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,270
I'm not sad.

88
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:43,310
Because I'm aware
you know what you're doing

89
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,720
You suggested us
to live in that small town,

90
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,120
and you came up
with such a grant wedding ceremony.

91
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,720
You did all this

92
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,800
to make the emperor come to you, no?

93
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:55,880
You certainly know me well.

94
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,000
You said they weren't the ones,

95
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,480
and it wasn't the right time.

96
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,390
It's because you know him.

97
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,720
If it weren't for his presence,

98
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,920
we wouldn't have been killed
there and then.

99
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,120
That's why we had to go into hiding.

100
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:13,950
That's right.

101
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,120
In order to make him
go all the way there,

102
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:20,000
we would have to stay high-profile
along his way.

103
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,560
It's the third day tomorrow.

104
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,680
And we'd be fine afterwards.

105
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,240
So hang in there.

106
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,160
Yes.

107
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,310
Assassin!

108
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,080
Your Majesty.

109
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,040
What's going on?

110
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,070
This was found on the door of the study.

111
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:49,190
A tiger tally?

112
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,800
It's a warning for me.

113
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:56,600
We searched the General's Mansion.
And no tiger tallies were found.

114
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,950
Even if Chen Fengxue had it with him,

115
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,240
there's no way
he'd get to pass it to someone else.

116
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:03,870
Your Majesty.

117
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,950
Forgive me.

118
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,070
General Chen has been a scheming

119
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,240
strategist.

120
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,600
Although he's on death row,

121
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:14,680
he's managed to have someone
threaten you with this tiger tally.

122
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,310
I'm afraid he's up to no good.

123
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,950
Instead...

124
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,120
Finish your word.

125
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,160
Blood is thicker than water.

126
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,270
Instead of fighting one another,

127
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,960
you should talk things over with him.

128
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:30,270
If things go south,
General Chen will rebel against you.

129
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,840
If both of you end up
killing one another,

130
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,190
I'm afraid our enemy country

131
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,950
will take advantage of the situation.

132
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,920
Uncle,

133
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,680
you're really pushing your luck.

134
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,120
Uncle.

135
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,160
I've underestimated you.

136
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:00,600
Your Majesty.

137
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,640
Looks like you've received

138
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:03,800
the gift.

139
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,720
You're threatening me
with the tiger tally, huh?

140
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,680
Yet you denied your attempt to rebel?

141
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,040
A tiger tally?

142
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:19,680
Your Majesty.

143
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:23,680
If I had wanted to stage a rebellion,
I wouldn't have waited until this day.

144
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,390
Even if that was the case,

145
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,840
I wouldn't have
to threaten you with the tally.

146
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,040
Instead, I could've just
forced you to surrender.

147
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,000
Your Majesty.

148
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,960
Back then, I eradicated the Xiao family

149
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,750
and go against Cai Jiuzhang.

150
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,040
I did all this
for the sake of Xiao Ningyun.

151
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,320
I knew the war between the Xiao
and Chen families was inevitable.

152
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:45,720
However,

153
00:08:47,192 --> 00:08:48,938
I must protect Xiao Ningyun.

154
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:51,309
Yet, little did I know

155
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:54,210
that, in the fear of you questioning me,

156
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,607
Qu Xiu sold the Xiao family out
and poisoned me.

157
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,720
And I became a cripple

158
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,796
after that.

159
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,720
But it was never my intention

160
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,910
to seize the throne.

161
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,600
I'm just an ordinary man

162
00:09:07,229 --> 00:09:09,265
who is both unambitious and lovestruck.

163
00:09:15,287 --> 00:09:17,910
I never knew
you're such an eloquent man.

164
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,000
Your Majesty.

165
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:23,270
Indeed.

166
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,360
I ever told you

167
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,720
to believe no one.

168
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,960
You do remember

169
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,870
everything I told you.

170
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,240
And I'm happy about that.

171
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,270
But you forgot about this one thing.

172
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,550
What's it?

173
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,000
Your self-confidence as an emperor.

174
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,270
Like I said,
not only do you have to be confident,

175
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,440
but you also have to be vain.

176
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,120
Because you are
the ruler of this country!

177
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,120
You're getting

178
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,360
more perceptive.

179
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:00,800
However, Your Majesty,

180
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,550
Your authority is unified

181
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,200
and cannot be overturned.

182
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:06,840
Your Majesty.

183
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,550
Never trust one completely.

184
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,550
Not even you, Uncle?

185
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,320
Only trust yourself

186
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,120
completely.

187
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:17,550
Not even me.

188
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,030
Don't be nervous, Your Majesty.

189
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:36,720
Not only do you need to stay confident,
but you also have to be vain.

190
00:10:37,025 --> 00:10:38,290
As an emperor,

191
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:39,240
never bow down

192
00:10:39,818 --> 00:10:40,923
no matter what happens.

193
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,880
You insist on getting rid of me.
It's not because you don't trust me.

194
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,840
You just don't trust yourself.

195
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,480
As long as I live,

196
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,200
I'm like a thorn in your flesh.
It's actually not your fault.

197
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:08,200
But it's not wrong for me
to protect my loved one either.

198
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,120
So let's talk things out.

199
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:12,960
What if I say no?

200
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,270
You will lead the army
and attack the imperial city.

201
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:17,750
Right?

202
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,790
That's possible.

203
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,480
What do you want?

204
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,360
Let me out.

205
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,280
I will meet up with the physician

206
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,080
and ask him pass the tiger tally
to the garrison troops.

207
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,792
Let you go?

208
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,920
If you lead the troops
and attack the city,

209
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,000
will I get to live?

210
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,320
I can let you have the tiger tally.

211
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,520
Then you can let me go.

212
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,880
Aren't you afraid
of me going back on my word?

213
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,600
I will trust you this once.

214
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,309
After all,
we used to have faith in one another.

215
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,665
How confident of you.

216
00:11:52,858 --> 00:11:53,670
Well,

217
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,120
you win after all.

218
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,600
Are you really going to give up on all

219
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,030
for a woman?

220
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,720
I have no regret.

221
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,030
Fine.

222
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,270
From now on,

223
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:09,750
you and Xiao Ningyun

224
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,360
cannot step foot in Southern Chen.

225
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,600
The body of the great
General Chen Fengxue

226
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:16,150
is buried in Songshan Imperial Crypt.

227
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,160
Thank you, Your Majesty.

228
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,080
Chen Fengxue

229
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,080
is gone from this world.

230
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:23,840
Guards.

231
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:28,790
Leave.

232
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,640
I believe you will
return the tiger tally to the troops.

233
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:34,910
I will.

234
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:46,360
Uncle.

235
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,150
From then on,

236
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,510
we will not meet again.

237
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,150
We've left everything behind.

238
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,120
Fengxue.

239
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:21,390
Do you regret it?

240
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:23,630
Not at all.

241
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,000
You are the only one I want

242
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,120
in this lifetime.

243
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,440
I don't regret it either.

244
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,390
From now on,

245
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,670
all the grudges
between me and the emperor,

246
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,320
and those between
the Chen and Xiao families,

247
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,550
they are all gone.

248
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,750
May the world

249
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,320
be peaceful forever.

250
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,000
May we not see another war.

251
00:14:07,701 --> 00:14:08,261
Have a taste.

252
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,360
As usual,

253
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,560
for this lifetime...

254
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,320
No.

255
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,720
For the upcoming

256
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,840
lifetimes,
I will only eat your bamboo leaf cake.

257
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,510
Eat up, then.

258
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,960
Look at how messy your hair is.
