00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:39,220
=The Prisoner of Love=

2
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,540
=Episode 23=

3
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,560
Look.
Doesn't that Vermilion Bird Well Mansion

4
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,680
look like a couple sitting
next to one another?

5
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:55,030
Just like us two.
What a unique sight.

6
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:59,960
Hu people
from the Western Regions call this

7
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,710
the Twins.

8
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:02,750
The Twins?

9
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,280
So this is the surprise

10
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,510
you got me?

11
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,510
Of course not.

12
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,280
I guess it's about time.

13
00:01:13,461 --> 00:01:14,058
One.

14
00:01:14,916 --> 00:01:15,461
Two.

15
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:17,010
Three.

16
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,570
It's high up there!

17
00:01:31,505 --> 00:01:32,516
Make a wish.

18
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,590
Well,
this is the annual Lantern Festival

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,230
they celebrate in this town.

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,430
Unlike us,

21
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,350
they don't play with lanterns

22
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:44,000
on the 15th day
of the first lunar month.

23
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,230
Instead, they do it on this day.

24
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:48,950
I see.

25
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,310
This is the surprise you've got me.

26
00:01:52,945 --> 00:01:53,621
Do you like it?

27
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,870
Ten miles of lanterns
illuminate the starry sky.

28
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,720
These are the most beautiful lanterns
I've ever seen.

29
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:11,520
Chen Fengxue!

30
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,400
Where have you been?

31
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,590
I went out to buy
your favorite porridgeand fruit pastries.

32
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,520
This is actually

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,520
the life I want.

34
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,280
Back in the Xiao's Mansion,

35
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,880
when I made up my mind
to elope with you,

36
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,400
I would always

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,190
fantasize about all this.

38
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,310
Sit.

39
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:53,750
If you like it,

40
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,710
we can stay
and live like an ordinary couple here.

41
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,000
Tomorrow,

42
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,360
I'll head to town
and get us some daily essentials.

43
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,280
Sure.

44
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:04,240
Eat up.

45
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,710
I wonder how Mr. Xu

46
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,960
is doing now.

47
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,120
Mr. Xu is nothing but capable.

48
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,030
So don't worry.

49
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,720
They found out about our plan.

50
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,240
To safeguard us,

51
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,080
Miss Ningyun

52
00:03:36,618 --> 00:03:37,430
jumped off the cliff.

53
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,190
She always hoped that
we could all let go of the past.

54
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,190
You can

55
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:46,870
have the money.

56
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,840
(I, Xu Yunze,)

57
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,360
(has spent my life
serving the Xiao clan)

58
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,560
(and remained loyal to Miss Ningyun.)

59
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:07,150
(Now,)

60
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,080
(where do I belong)

61
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,280
(in this vast world?)

62
00:04:24,247 --> 00:04:25,360
They're coming.

63
00:04:40,138 --> 00:04:41,390
They certainly act fast.

64
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:44,480
Didn't you say

65
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,800
you wanted them to find you?

66
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,280
So, why are you hiding here?

67
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:48,920
I did say so.

68
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,880
But they're not the right ones.
And it's not the right time yet.

69
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:58,950
I guess I know

70
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,560
what you're talking about.

71
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:02,680
Let's go.

72
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:10,310
Yes, this color looks good on you.

73
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:10,920
Really?

74
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,480
I want something brighter.

75
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,600
Do you have it?

76
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,430
Yes.

77
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,750
Show us.

78
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:16,800
Please have a look at this.

79
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,270
This looks good.

80
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:20,240
Sir.

81
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,430
What's this?

82
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:25,390
This?

83
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,070
It's the wedding gown we made

84
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:27,920
for Miss Sun

85
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:29,870
of the Sun's Mansion.

86
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,520
Do you have any ready-made gowns?

87
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,720
We do.

88
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,360
But they're not
as nice as custom-made ones.

89
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,720
Do you have

90
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,270
any quality ones?

91
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,360
Price is not an issue.

92
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,600
There is indeed one.

93
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,040
But it's used

94
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,000
as a display item

95
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,270
to show our fine craftsmanship.

96
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,270
Though it's a display item,

97
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,430
it's delicately made,

98
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,400
not to mention
the top-notch fabric used.

99
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,830
Thus, it's kind of expensive.

100
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:04,720
Sir.

101
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,480
This jade pendant

102
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,190
is a tribute from Liu.

103
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:11,310
You can't find another one in Southern Chen.
It's worth a thousand liang of gold.

104
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,120
Are you really going to buy a gown

105
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,600
with such a valuable stuff?

106
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,160
Also,

107
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,680
please help me

108
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,720
organize a wedding ceremony.

109
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,830
The grander the better.

110
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,160
If you don't believe me,

111
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,160
you may pawn this pendant

112
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,120
at the shop.

113
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,310
Take your time.

114
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,200
At first glance,
I know this is nothing ordinary.

115
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,190
And you don't look like a baddie.

116
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:41,190
Fine.

117
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,440
Just leave the wedding ceremony to me.

118
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:46,750
Thank you, sir.

119
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:59,600
Thanks to me,

120
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,390
you've had this face.

121
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,190
I'm just reclaiming what is mine.

122
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,830
Like I said,

123
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm going to reclaim what belong to me,

124
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:12,800
bit by bit.

125
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,830
My father and I

126
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:22,270
have been used by you.

127
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,950
It's because you looked down on me.

128
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:28,270
Don't you remember

129
00:07:29,469 --> 00:07:32,167
how you used to boss me around?

130
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,510
Also, your father and Chen Fengxue

131
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,950
were trying to manipulate me.

132
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:44,160
I shall get rid of them
by having them fight tooth and nail.

133
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,360
How exciting.

134
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,560
Your Majesty.

135
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,190
There's news from General Zhao.

136
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,680
They turned over all the stones.

137
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:04,800
But Chen Fengxue and Xiao Ningyun's
bodies weren't found in Tianling Cliff.

138
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,950
I bet they're still alive.

139
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:15,040
Issue my decree.
Pay them a visit at night.

140
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,600
Report it to me once they've been found.

141
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,560
I want to catch them myself.

142
00:08:21,738 --> 00:08:22,440
Yes, Your Majesty.

143
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:35,840
Well,

144
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:37,840
I never kill women.

145
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,870
It's so beautiful here!

146
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,000
What is this?

147
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,080
I made you

148
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:56,870
this wreath.

149
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:00,870
Ningyun.

150
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:02,960
As I said,

151
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,120
you are my rose-like lover.

152
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,200
Though we don't have any roses here,

153
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,200
you remain my most beloved one

154
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,320
in this lifetime.

155
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,030
We didn't officiate our marriage then.

156
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,270
Ningyun.

157
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,750
Do I get a second chance

158
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,390
to be your life partner?

159
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,120
Will you marry me?

160
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:01,360
Ningyun.

161
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,870
You are finally my wife.

162
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,000
Excellent!

163
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,550
Uncle.

164
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,200
How have you been lately?
