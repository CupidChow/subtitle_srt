00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,540
=Episode 20=

3
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:50,280
Cai Jiuzhang,

4
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,070
you won't kill me so easily!

5
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:54,240
Mr. Qu. Where do you think you're going?

6
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,140
Chen Fengxue! It's broad daylight.

7
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,430
(Qu Xiu, former retainer of Xiao clan)
Are you a human or a ghost?

8
00:00:59,430 --> 00:00:59,880
Qu Xiu.

9
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,520
Come with me if you wish

10
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,600
to live.

11
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,430
Go with you?

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,120
As if I'd fall for that!

13
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,400
Thank you for covering for me.

14
00:01:18,967 --> 00:01:20,560
The physician said
Chen Fengxue's gone off

15
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,640
to catch Qu Xiu.

16
00:01:22,581 --> 00:01:23,360
I have to find him.

17
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,640
It's too dangerous.

18
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:26,680
I'll come with you.

19
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,440
If you don't want to die, come with me.

20
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,120
Chen Fengxue!

21
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,240
What are you doing here?

22
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,260
There are more pursuers behind us.

23
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,840
I'll lead them away.
You guys go on ahead.

24
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,160
Take care of yourself.

25
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:27,910
Miss Ningyun!

26
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:28,710
Back then,

27
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,470
it was

28
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,240
Cai Jiuzhang who...

29
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,760
You'll shut your mouth
if you want to live!

30
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:32,870
Move.

31
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,520
What? Where are you taking me?

32
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:35,960
I won't go!

33
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,870
Mercy!

34
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,150
I won't go!

35
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:44,470
Get in.

36
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,030
Qu Xiu.

37
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,910
You forged
the Xiao clan's letter of collusion

38
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,470
and gave it to Cai Jiuzhang, didn't you?

39
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,000
Miss Xiao,

40
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,120
I was wronged!

41
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,560
It was him! He was the one who instigated
the extermination of the Xiao clan!

42
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,560
He's your enemy!

43
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,480
You refuse to come clean.

44
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,840
Then I'll make sure
you suffer worse than death.

45
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:24,630
You were the one who insisted on
imprisoning Chen Fengxue back then.

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,190
So, you must know

47
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,080
exactly what happened, don't you?

48
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:29,630
No, please!

49
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,280
I'll talk.

50
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,000
I'll talk...

51
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,190
The truth is...

52
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:40,910
Why are you telling me this?

53
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,310
I don't want Ningyun to leave me,
and I don't want her to be deceived.

54
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,560
(Xiao Ningyun's father)
That son of the Chen family

55
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,120
must have ulterior motives for her.

56
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,630
You did the right thing.

57
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:51,520
I have

58
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:53,080
my own plans.

59
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,800
Qu Xiu.

60
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:15,960
Yes, sir.

61
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,040
Will this powder

62
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,390
really

63
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:21,240
keep her bedridden for a month?

64
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:24,000
Don't let it ruin my plans.

65
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,070
Mr. Xiao.

66
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:29,750
I obtained

67
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,390
this medicinal powder

68
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:34,120
from a renowned expert

69
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,360
at great expense.

70
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,040
It is

71
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,680
absolutely foolproof.

72
00:04:40,397 --> 00:04:41,680
(Xiao Ningyun's mother)

73
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,630
It won't harm

74
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,120
Ningyun's health, will it?

75
00:04:49,449 --> 00:04:50,479
Mrs. Xiao,

76
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,870
rest assured.

77
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,270
I can

78
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,800
first administer

79
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,270
an ice poison

80
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,600
to control the effects of the medicine.

81
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,830
After a month,

82
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,560
the Thousand Snow Pill can be used

83
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,870
as an antidote,

84
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,040
and she will recover completely.

85
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,870
It won't harm Miss Ningyun

86
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,310
in the slightest.

87
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,600
Good.

88
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,120
Dear,

89
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,000
don't be softhearted.

90
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,870
Don't you know

91
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,190
your own daughter?

92
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:26,920
As long

93
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,160
as that Chen Fengxue confesses,

94
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:29,830
she will

95
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,830
give up on him.

96
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:33,430
Or do you want

97
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:36,000
to watch her get deceived and elope

98
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:38,120
with that Chen?

99
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,920
You're right.

100
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:46,830
Then,

101
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,270
I leave it to you.

102
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:50,390
All right.

103
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,440
What are you looking at?

104
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:13,600
Mrs. Xiao.

105
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,070
He has taken the bait.

106
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:18,240
Speak.

107
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,680
Are you

108
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,750
the foreign spy who stole

109
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:21,720
the map of Southern Chen?

110
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,270
No.

111
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:24,870
I am not.

112
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,640
You really won't give in
until you see your own grave, huh?

113
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,040
Xiao Ningyun!

114
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,310
I hate you!

115
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,360
If I survive,

116
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,480
I will destroy your entire clan

117
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,120
and make you kneel at my feet!

118
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,000
That is the whole truth

119
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:05,920
of...

120
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,360
what happened...

121
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,270
So everything that happened

122
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,310
was your plan.

123
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,800
No!

124
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,390
I...

125
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:14,950
I...

126
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,720
Wait!

127
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,610
Chen Fengxue!

128
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,240
Don't kill him yet.
He's still useful to us.

129
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:28,630
I'm sorry, Ningyun.

130
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,270
You suffered
because of my misunderstanding.

131
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,240
You can't blame yourself.

132
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,920
Someone deliberately set us up.

133
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:40,360
You are not to blame.

134
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:44,920
Ultimately,

135
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,240
it was all my fault.

136
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,270
I was at fault too.

137
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,320
After everything I put you through,

138
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,600
do you resent me?

139
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,270
I deserved whatever suffering

140
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,120
you inflicted on me.

141
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:06,240
I was also poisoned back then
and was bedridden for a month.

142
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,720
I took the Thousand Snow Pill,

143
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,870
but it didn't fully cure me.

144
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,070
The physicians of the Xiao clan

145
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,680
used bloodletting,

146
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,270
ice therapy, fire therapy,
and wax therapy

147
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,950
to fully heal me.

148
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:21,750
That's why I wanted

149
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,040
to try them on you.

150
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,390
Thanks to your "treatment,"

151
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:28,040
look at me now.

152
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,830
My body is in peak condition.

153
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:30,880
I am brimming with energy.

154
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,870
Well, since you're so full of energy,

155
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,270
go pick

156
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,030
some fruit

157
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:39,080
and fetch me some water.

158
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,030
I'll go

159
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:43,480
get you some spring water
and gather some fruit right away.

160
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,200
Fengxue.

161
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,080
Wouldn't it be wonderful

162
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,870
if we could live a peaceful life,

163
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,240
picking fruit

164
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,960
and hunting wild game?

165
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,150
Once we kill Cai Jiuzhang

166
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,840
and that treacherous Qu Xiu,

167
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,480
let's leave

168
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,030
all this chaos behind, shall we?

169
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:07,750
All right.

170
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,320
As you wish.
