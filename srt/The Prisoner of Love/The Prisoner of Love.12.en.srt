00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:39,220
=The Prisoner of Love=

2
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,540
=Episode 12=

3
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,870
This token was found on Xu Yunze.

4
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:55,120
The assassins worked for Xu Yunze.

5
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,590
The ones who attacked Miss Xiao

6
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,270
were sent by Cai Yuehan.

7
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,870
I understand.

8
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:02,310
Keep a close watch
on Xu Yunze and Xiao Zijin.

9
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:05,510
Didn't you say you'd
spare them, General?

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,840
Why the sudden change of heart?

11
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,120
Shi Ying.

12
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:13,600
You've been talking too much lately.

13
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,990
I preferred you when you were quiet.

14
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:20,320
I'll take my leave.

15
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,510
Open it.

16
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:45,529
Leave us.

17
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:46,430
Yes, sir.

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,760
Starving yourself isn't like you.

19
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:56,240
What are you trying to do?

20
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:57,990
You pretended to be generous

21
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:00,200
by releasing Xu Yunze and Zijin.

22
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,550
Wasn't it just to make me a scapegoat?

23
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,639
And now you're using me

24
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,040
to capture them again,

25
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,910
to wipe out the entire Xiao clan.

26
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:11,200
Yes.

27
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,720
That's right.

28
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:15,070
I want the world to despise you,

29
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:16,849
so you'll never leave me,

30
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:18,320
so you can never betray me.

31
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:20,999
Madman.

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,479
You lunatic!

33
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,200
Yes.

34
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,630
I am a lunatic.

35
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:26,319
And you betrayed the Xiao clan

36
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,070
and led them to their demise.

37
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,110
A madman and a traitor,

38
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:31,560
a perfect match.

39
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,760
Hurry!

40
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:53,560
Get inside.

41
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,390
Come in.

42
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,559
Miss.

43
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,809
I just saw someone

44
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,529
fleeing toward your room.

45
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:06,719
For your safety,

46
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,159
please let me search the room.

47
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,110
There's nothing unusual here.

48
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:11,280
You may leave.

49
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:11,999
Miss Ningyun...

50
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,070
Get out!

51
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:22,630
Come out now.

52
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,439
Miss.

53
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,630
Why did you help me?

54
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,280
Because I like you.

55
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,559
Why were you trying

56
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,040
to escape today?

57
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,350
I don't know how to explain it to you.

58
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,510
I received a letter from an enemy state.

59
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,480
But I was framed.

60
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,089
The moment I finished reading it,

61
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,529
soldiers stormed into my room.

62
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:44,249
I had no choice

63
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,280
but to run.

64
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,529
I never saw this letter.

65
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:57,720
I believe you.

66
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,790
But...

67
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:03,559
Do you think

68
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,599
what I did was too reckless?

69
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,879
Reckless?

70
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,350
You're completely insane.

71
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:09,630
Aren't you afraid

72
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:10,999
that I really am a traitor?

73
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,209
If you're a traitor,

74
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,209
then I'm a madwoman.

75
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:13,969
The two of us are

76
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:14,880
a perfect match.

77
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,560
(Perhaps the lie)

78
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,120
(began that night.)

79
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,320
Do you remember now?

80
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:35,209
You haven't forgotten

81
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:36,510
everything about us.

82
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,240
Right?

83
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:39,569
I forgot.

84
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,830
I forgot.

85
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,969
I forgot everything.

86
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:43,390
I don't remember a thing!

87
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,360
Good.

88
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,070
Very good.

89
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:55,630
Then let's create new memories.

90
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:57,409
What are you doing?

91
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:57,969
Chen Fengxue!

92
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:58,769
What are you doing?

93
00:04:58,770 --> 00:04:59,830
Let go of me!

94
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:00,800
Let go!

95
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:02,830
Xiao Ningyun, listen closely.

96
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,769
You belong to me alone.

97
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:06,409
Your memories will only be of me,

98
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:07,590
whether love or hate.

99
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:14,590
I will heal your face.

100
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,470
Then, I will marry you.

101
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,089
Once you become my wife by

102
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:19,329
selling yourself for survival,

103
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:22,000
all ties between you and the Xiao family
will be severed for good.

104
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,119
Keep dreaming.

105
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,000
I would rather die than marry you.

106
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,200
I'll remember this lesson today.

107
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,279
From now on,

108
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,560
I will never let you toy with me again.

109
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,630
You'd better mean it.

110
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:47,360
Xiao Ningyun...

111
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,440
I will kill you!

112
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:53,390
His Majesty has arrived!

113
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,560
I told you Xiao Ningyun
mustn't be left alive.

114
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:04,030
And yet, you fail every time.

115
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,560
Do you know who you're speaking to?

116
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:10,599
You used to rely on your beauty

117
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,560
and your father's power to protect you.

118
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,590
But now, you're nothing
but a discarded pawn.

119
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:18,240
Your Majesty.

120
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:21,680
Chen Fengxue is our common enemy.

121
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,200
You resent the way I rule,

122
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,070
but how are you any different from him?

123
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,209
You were once

124
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:30,360
the grand chancellor's noble daughter.

125
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,320
And now,

126
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,409
just a hideous wretch.

127
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:37,200
Enough! Stop talking!

128
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:42,240
Didn't the grand chancellor
want you to marry me?

129
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,240
I can agree with it.

130
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,710
I can also heal your face.

131
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:48,270
However,

132
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,320
I have one condition.

133
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:02,070
That shouldn't be possible.

134
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:06,409
His Majesty's scar-healing cream

135
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:07,950
is a tribute from a foreign state.

136
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:10,120
Normally, scars heal within three days.

137
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,919
Miss Xiao has been using it for so long,

138
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,270
why isn't it working?

139
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,800
Spare me your false concern.

140
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:29,529
You're deliberately

141
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:30,880
avoiding the medicine.

142
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,710
Are you afraid that if you heal,
I'll marry you at once?

143
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,769
Cai Yuehan used

144
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:36,009
the exact same ointment.

145
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:37,440
Her face healed long ago,

146
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:38,849
but yours hasn't improved at all.

147
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:40,390
Don't deny it now.

148
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,880
Yes.

149
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:43,150
Yes, I did it on purpose.

150
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,599
I'd rather never heal

151
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,920
than marry you.

152
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,950
That's not up to you.

153
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:54,390
No matter what your face looks like,

154
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,270
I will marry you all the same.

155
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,760
Fine.

156
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,679
If you want to marry me,

157
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,070
it's not impossible.

158
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:05,329
Have Xu Yunze and my brother

159
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,800
attend the ceremony.

160
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,390
Agreed.

161
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:11,200
I'll do as you ask.

162
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,510
Chen Fengxue,

163
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:13,849
you'd better not regret

164
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:15,200
marrying me.

165
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:17,270
Why would I regret it?

166
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:25,969
(Do you really think your poison)

167
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:27,470
(has been cured?)

168
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:29,630
(Since you've missed my antidote,)

169
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,360
(don't blame me for what comes next.)

170
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,879
Miss Xiao is about to marry the general.

171
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,230
She will soon become our general's wife.

172
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,750
Miss Xiao asked me to deliver this.

173
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,879
A celebratory wine

174
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,040
for you both.

175
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,640
No.

176
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:55,350
Ningyun would never marry him.

177
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:57,800
You know her personality.

178
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:59,110
If it weren't her choice,

179
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:00,920
she would rather take her own life.

180
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:02,800
No one could force her.

181
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:04,110
Did she really

182
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,440
send us this wine?

183
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,590
Mr. Xu, you saw it that day too.

184
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,399
She betrayed you all

185
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,830
just to save the general.

186
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:13,870
Now, she sends a wedding gift.

187
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,520
This is perfectly normal.

188
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:16,950
I don't believe

189
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,280
a single word you say.

190
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:21,990
Mr. Xu.

191
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:23,089
When I saw her

192
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:24,849
betray herself for survival,

193
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:25,999
I refused to believe it.

194
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,089
But now, she has ruined our plan,

195
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:29,849
and got the Xiao clan's men killed

196
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:31,320
How can you still trust her?

197
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:33,169
Fine.

198
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:34,160
I'll drink it.

199
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:35,399
Tell her this.

200
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,209
From this day on,

201
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,870
we are nothing to each other.

202
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:06,209
Your wedding attire

203
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,710
is utterly beautiful.

204
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:11,950
But perhaps you don't know

205
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:14,520
that the color red

206
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:18,160
was dyed with your brother's blood.

207
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:22,350
What do you mean?

208
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,849
To prove his loyalty to His Majesty

209
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,990
and secure this marriage,

210
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:32,359
Chen Fengxue personally
killed Xiao Zijin.

211
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,440
That's impossible.

212
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:37,719
If you don't believe me,

213
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,759
just wait and see.

214
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,239
If he attends your wedding today,

215
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,560
you'll know if it's true.

216
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,320
Congratulations.

217
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,830
My best wishes.

218
00:11:20,693 --> 00:11:22,265
How have you been lately?

219
00:11:22,773 --> 00:11:24,127
Not bad.

220
00:11:27,115 --> 00:11:28,227
It's a token of appreciation.

221
00:11:28,228 --> 00:11:29,378
You flatter me.

222
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:27,400
Tell me.

223
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,230
Where is my brother?

224
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,470
Did you kill him?
