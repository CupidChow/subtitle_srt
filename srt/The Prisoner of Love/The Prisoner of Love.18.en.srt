=The Prisoner of Love=

2
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,540
=Episode 18=

3
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:56,880
You actually used

4
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:58,600
an aphrodisiac on me.

5
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,770
And you still deny your feelings for me?

6
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,210
I merely wanted

7
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:09,569
to remind you

8
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,210
of your place.

9
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:16,080
Let's see who can't leave whom.

10
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,560
Whether it's you

11
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,160
who can't leave me

12
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:21,970
or the other way around.

13
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:29,490
Spending a night with you
is no loss for me.

14
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:32,970
Don't be impatient, General Chen.

15
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,050
Do you enjoy

16
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:42,890
this sensation of ice and fire?

17
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:46,160
Even better than a night of passion.

18
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:49,160
Do you remember how you made me

19
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,080
suffer in the cage,

20
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:53,330
exposed to the scorching sun?

21
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:57,250
You still hold grudges
just like when you were a child.

22
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:01,139
And you're still the same as back then.

23
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,330
Always my defeated opponent.

24
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:04,890
If that's the case,

25
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,059
why don't you

26
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,800
just freeze me to death here?

27
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:13,120
You'll now endure

28
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,490
the same suffering

29
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:16,490
you once

30
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,240
forced upon me.

31
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:31,890
This is strange.

32
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:33,219
Miss Xiao

33
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,859
has tortured you so much,

34
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,009
yet instead of worsening,

35
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:37,360
your body has actually improved.

36
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:39,560
It might be the final sign
before the inevitable.

37
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,419
You mustn't say that.

38
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,080
You are blessed.

39
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:45,520
Sometimes misfortune can turn
into fortune.

40
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:47,890
But

41
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:49,890
does Miss Ningyun

42
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,570
know medicine?

43
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:55,520
She doesn't.

44
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,099
I must leave at once.

45
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,570
Prepare my horse.

46
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,600
Ningyun won't
make things difficult for you.

47
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,210
Once I'm gone,

48
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,890
find a way to escape.

49
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:34,490
Where do you think you're going,
General Chen?

50
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,010
Stop!

51
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,050
Miss Ningyun.

52
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:45,680
Save your breath.

53
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,210
This man tried to escape.

54
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:49,570
If I hadn't

55
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,840
been prepared,

56
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,379
he would've already disappeared

57
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,640
without a trace.

58
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,979
He's a vital asset in our bargaining.

59
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,290
It would be a waste to kill him.

60
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,450
What use is a general

61
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:09,699
that is supposedly death?

62
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,379
Elder.

63
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,819
He was given an imperial burial
in Southern Chen.

64
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,730
That proves how highly he was regarded.

65
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,600
Don't try to deceive me with such words.

66
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:23,659
Unless

67
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,979
you kill him

68
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,370
yourself,

69
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,419
you are

70
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,450
betraying the Xiao clan!

71
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:30,459
I will never

72
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,419
be loyal

73
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,010
to a traitor of the Xiao clan!

74
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:36,890
Stop!

75
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,040
Is this a rebellion?

76
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,890
Have you lost your minds?
How dare you disrespect Miss Ningyun!

77
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,249
I am only loyal

78
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,960
to the lady
who has no divided loyalties.

79
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,370
What's wrong with that?

80
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,370
That's right.

81
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,720
If she betrays the clan,

82
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,770
we won't show her any mercy either.

83
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,450
Anyone who touches her

84
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,579
will have to answer to my blade first!

85
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,640
Yunze.

86
00:05:12,355 --> 00:05:13,855
He carved these words on my back

87
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,930
with his own hands.

88
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:21,280
After all the humiliation
he inflicted on me,

89
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,840
how could I let him die so easily?

90
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:36,250
I must return every bit of my suffering
to him before he can die.

91
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:49,249
Miss Ningyun,

92
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,480
why are you hesitating?

93
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,960
I'm just looking for the right spot.

94
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:10,010
I want him to suffer a fate
worse than death.

95
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,400
Very well.

96
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:15,450
Since that's the case,

97
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:16,419
I'll trust you

98
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,080
this once.

99
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,250
Let's go.

100
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,570
It's just a flesh wound.

101
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:40,450
I have no need for your concern.

102
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,570
How did you get that scar

103
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:44,130
on your collarbone?

104
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,840
(Slave)
Isn't it all thanks to you?

105
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:49,570
Me?

106
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,010
Back then,

107
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:57,010
I was falsely accused
of conspiring against the state.

108
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,200
You captured me
under the pretense of eloping

109
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,760
and subjected me to severe punishment,

110
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,280
forcing me to confess to being a traitor

111
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,690
so you could eliminate a rival.

112
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,930
Don't pretend you've lost your memory.

113
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,099
I have no recollection

114
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,690
of any of this.

115
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,890
You did it for your family.

116
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,450
I don't blame you.

117
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:23,640
But why did you deceive my feelings?

118
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,520
Why did you use
your supposed love for me

119
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,080
to achieve such a despicable goal?

120
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:31,249
I didn't! I don't remember any of this!

121
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:35,640
I never thought you'd have the nerve to act
without owning up to it.

122
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:41,040
I was poisoned.

123
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,859
The only cure for me

124
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,770
was the world's only Thousand Snow Pill.

125
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,330
So I asked you for it.

126
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,640
But you

127
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,130
ate it yourself,

128
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,690
claiming you needed it
to replenish your health.

129
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,010
I had no choice

130
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,010
but to rely on my master.

131
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:02,520
The poison couldn't be fully removed,
and my legs were crippled.

132
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,520
I suppose

133
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:08,010
you've long since forgotten all this.

134
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:10,280
How could this be?

135
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,640
I genuinely don't remember.

136
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,960
I don't remember you ever asking me
for the Thousand Snow Pill.

137
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,130
I had no idea at all!

138
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,210
None of that matters anymore.

139
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,370
Xiao Ningyun.

140
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,480
You and I were never meant
to cross paths.

141
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,080
Be it love

142
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,250
or hate.

143
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,720
From now on,

144
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:35,360
we are nothing but strangers.

145
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:37,650
No more entanglements.

146
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,480
Miss Xiao.

147
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:50,840
You wanted to see me?

148
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,570
Xu Yunze.

149
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,080
Do you remember

150
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:57,690
who ordered you

151
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,570
to capture Chen Fengxue?

152
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:01,930
I was following

153
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,050
the general's orders

154
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,219
when we captured Chen Fengxue
after he tried to escape.

155
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,690
He said he received
a handwritten order from you.

156
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,600
That's impossible!

157
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:13,240
Even you believe that?

158
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:14,299
But I never issued

159
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,720
such an order!

160
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,240
I was merely

161
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,720
a deputy general.

162
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,120
I knew nothing.

163
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:21,530
But

164
00:09:22,572 --> 00:09:24,246
I always assumed that was the truth.

165
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,179
(No wonder Chen Fengxue)

166
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,690
(hates me so much.)

167
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,170
(But I did nothing back then.)

168
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:32,760
(Someone must have
orchestrated all of this.)

169
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:35,600
Xu Yunze.

170
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,129
What became

171
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:38,609
of the Xiao clan's retainer,

172
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,000
Qu Xiu?

173
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,480
Qu Xiu disappeared after the downfall

174
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,299
of the Xiao clan.

175
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,129
I knew it.

176
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:46,360
That traitor!

177
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,729
Even if there were misunderstandings
in the past,

178
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,330
it's too late to change anything now.

179
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:52,680
Right now, King Nanchen has lost
his general's support.

180
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,489
This is the perfect moment for us
to act and force the emperor to abdicate!

181
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:57,240
You must not let personal feelings
hold you back again!

182
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,819
Silence! It's one thing for the clan members
to be blind to the situation.

183
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,409
But even you are saying this?

184
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:04,360
King Nanchen has the people's support.

185
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,299
With our current strength,

186
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,939
we have no chance of exacting revenge!

187
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:08,880
Miss Xiao.

188
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,650
Can you really accept that?

189
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:13,120
Should we start a bloody war

190
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:15,480
just to ease our own resentment?

191
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,080
Should we drag

192
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,409
our peaceful clan members
into suffering,

193
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:22,840
just for the sake of revenge?

194
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:24,530
Your actions will only

195
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:27,369
disappoint those
who remain loyal to the Xiao clan.

196
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:28,450
Leave.

197
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:29,529
Miss Xiao.

198
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:30,570
My only concern right now

199
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,290
is tracking down Qu Xiu,

200
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:34,290
who started all this in the first place.

201
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:35,699
I urge you to reconsider...

202
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,609
We'll discuss revenge another time.

203
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:38,600
Leave.

204
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,360
(They are all blinded by vengeance.)

205
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:46,000
(I can't let Chen Fengxue
stay here any longer.)

206
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:48,080
(No matter what happens,)

207
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,810
(they will kill him.)

208
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:57,480
I apologize if my actions, influenced by
General Chen, have caused any offense.

209
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,810
I ask for your understanding.

210
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,059
We have not

211
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,579
lost faith in you over this matter.

212
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,409
We only wish to know.

213
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:06,170
What do you intend to do with him?

214
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,650
Once matters are settled,

215
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,530
I will sentence him to death
by a thousand cuts.

216
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:13,729
- Great!
- Great!

217
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:15,120
Miss Ningyun is wise!

218
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,880
- Miss Ningyun is wise!
- Here!

219
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,210
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

220
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:25,729
This wine

221
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:27,210
is so strong...

222
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:53,600
Chen Fengxue.

223
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:04,810
You said

224
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:07,330
that from now on,

225
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,720
you only wish for us to be strangers.

226
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,690
I will grant you that wish.

227
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,050
Thank you.

228
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,050
May we never

229
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:20,930
meet again.

230
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:29,050
(Go.)

231
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,210
(And never come back.)
