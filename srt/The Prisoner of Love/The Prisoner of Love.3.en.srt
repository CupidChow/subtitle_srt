=The Prisoner of Love=

00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,540
=Episode 3=

3
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:12,870
Greetings, sir.

4
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:14,590
Last night,

5
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,640
having consumed her blood,

6
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,360
I managed to stand for a while.

7
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:20,350
Looks like

8
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:22,950
her blood does help with my condition.

9
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:24,640
Congratulations, sir!

10
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,840
Keep working on it.

11
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:27,950
The sooner the better.

12
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:28,510
Yes, sir.

13
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:29,640
Oh, right.

14
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,560
Come up with some prescriptions
that can nourish her body.

15
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,310
I can't let her die

16
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,790
before I achieve my goal.

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,840
Rest assured, sir.

18
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,640
I know

19
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,430
what to do.

20
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:42,682
Okay. You may leave.

21
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,200
Don't go...

22
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,120
Ningyun.

23
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,840
If you had asked me to stay,

24
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,680
all of this tragedy
wouldn't have happened.

25
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,150
But now...

26
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:14,960
All I can do is hate you.

27
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,120
For real?

28
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:30,560
But

29
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,470
the general never let anyone
sleep in his room.

30
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,150
A slave, huh?

31
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,190
Maybe

32
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,710
we're getting a new mistress soon.

33
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,960
Please pardon me, miss.

34
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,400
If you dare spouting nonsense again,

35
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,840
I shall cut off your tongues!

36
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,000
We will not do it again.

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Yes, miss.

38
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,310
Xiao Ningyun.

39
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,280
I will make your life miserable.

40
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,750
I've had a long day.

41
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,360
You will feed me.

42
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:44,960
You're coming with me

43
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,520
to the palace banquet tomorrow.

44
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,240
Envoys from various countries
will be there too.

45
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:52,960
I heard

46
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,080
that your admirer is one of them.

47
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:57,960
I wonder

48
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,960
what they will think

49
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:02,680
of your current state.

50
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,470
Looks like

51
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:09,590
you're going to make me
perform something tomorrow night.

52
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:12,430
Why?

53
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:13,760
You're not happy about it?

54
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,000
Since you're so eager to be my slave,

55
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,270
you're in no place to say no.

56
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:20,600
Xiao Ningyun.

57
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,270
Well,

58
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,070
do you regret your choice?

59
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,310
I regret knowing you.

60
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,680
Xiao Ningyun.

61
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:36,160
You should know by now

62
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,390
who you can

63
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,480
and shouldn't mess with, huh?

64
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,360
Bear this in mind.

65
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,950
When I practice my swordsmanship later,
make sure no one is around.

66
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,680
How dare you dodge it!

67
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,270
Greeting, Miss Xiao.

68
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,430
Did you know

69
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,040
this outfit of mine is made of
top-notch colored silkworm silk?

70
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:07,830
It's worth a lot.
Do you think you can make up for it?

71
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,680
It's just an outfit.

72
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,920
I'll compensate you.

73
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,600
Or

74
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,680
I will clean it for you.

75
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,310
Mr. Chen,

76
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,120
it's said that
you're a royal family member

77
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:19,750
who is both arrogant

78
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,000
and a bully.

79
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:21,870
Today,

80
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:22,950
I will teach you a lesson

81
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,720
and put you in your place!

82
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,600
Why didn't you dodge it?

83
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,430
Are you happy now, Miss Xiao?

84
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,240
Remember

85
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,270
who you can

86
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,720
and shouldn't mess with

87
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,070
in our mansion.

88
00:05:50,538 --> 00:05:51,270
Pick that up.

89
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,920
(The Ling envoy, Zhao Yan)

90
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,000
(who is attending the palace banquet)

91
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,870
(is Mr. Xu's sworn brother.)

92
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,040
(If I'm able)

93
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:11,000
(to give him this earring as a token,)

94
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,360
(there is hope.)

95
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,560
(Chen Fengxue.)

96
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,120
(You will regret
bringing me to the palace banquet.)

97
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:22,430
Miss.

98
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,870
The general got this outfit
especially for you.

99
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:25,800
Please get changed now.

100
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,750
The general is being so kind to you.

101
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:32,720
This outfit

102
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,510
is made of top-notch
colored silkworm silk.

103
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,830
This kind of silk is rare to come by.

104
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,190
This is all there is

105
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,070
in this mansion.

106
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,800
It was meant to for the general's use.

107
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,920
Instead, he had us

108
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,510
make you this outfit.

109
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,040
What a nice one.

110
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,270
It's just his way

111
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,240
to shame me.

112
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,390
Why are you saying so?

113
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,830
It's an honor after all.

114
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,510
So you should remember his kindness.

115
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,630
All right. You may leave now.

116
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,720
The songs and dances of Southern Chen
are utterly vulgar.

117
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,430
(The Chu envoy)

118
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,800
When it comes to songs and dances,

119
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,830
Chu

120
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,000
is second to none.

121
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,800
Songs and dances

122
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,070
are never our forte here.

123
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,310
Pardon me.

124
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,870
Your Majesty.

125
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,750
The fellow envoys

126
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,800
came all the way here to Southern Chen
with their kind thoughts.

127
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,430
Of course we need to play a good host.

128
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:32,030
When it comes to dances,

129
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:35,200
the Xiao family is the best
in Southern Chen.

130
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:36,910
Indeed.

131
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,360
It slipped my mind.

132
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:42,870
The once arrogant Miss Xiao

133
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:45,120
is now a convict here in Southern Chen.

134
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,270
How powerful of you,

135
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:48,440
Your Majesty.

136
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,600
As a convict,

137
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,920
she should do her part
to share our kingdom's burden.

138
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:58,510
Your Majesty.

139
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,120
In my opinion,

140
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,790
we should have Xiao Ningyun

141
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,510
do a dance for us all.

142
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:08,670
Uncle.

143
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,550
What do you think?

144
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,800
You can make the call here,
Your Majesty.

145
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:17,790
Looks like

146
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,390
I'm really here to put on a performance.

147
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:22,390
Great.

148
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:26,510
The Xiao family is said to be famous
for the Hundred Flowers Blooming Dance.

149
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:29,150
The performer is to dance barefoot
on a flower platform.

150
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:30,870
Your Majesty.

151
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:33,270
I've gotten everything ready.

152
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,150
Xiao Ningyun.

153
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:45,510
Please.

154
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,000
Miss Xiao.

155
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,390
How delicate you are.

156
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,030
Your feet is injured from the dance.

157
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,960
(Zhao Yan, the Ling envoy)
I feel so sorry for you!

158
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,000
I shall ask His Majesty for a reward.

159
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,240
You will return to Chu with me.

160
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,870
I'll make sure you live a luxury life!

161
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,320
I'll make sure you live a luxury life!

162
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:40,960
Stop avoiding me.

163
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,030
I'll make sure you live a luxury life!

164
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,320
Hands off, she is mine!
