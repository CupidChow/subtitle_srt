=The Prisoner of Love=

2
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,540
=Episode 13=

3
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,670
Where is my brother?

4
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:50,760
Did you kill him?

5
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,230
Don't worry.

6
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:02,550
I'll give you a reasonable explanation.

7
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,950
I don't need your explanation.

8
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:05,639
I won't let you get away with this.

9
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,270
I won't forgive you!

10
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:09,249
By order of His Majesty,

11
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,079
we are arresting the murderer
of Duke of Anding

12
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,070
General, please come with us.

13
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:16,200
On whose orders?

14
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:18,080
Naturally, by the decree of His Majesty.

15
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,920
General, don't make things
difficult for us.

16
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,480
Take him away.

17
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:31,559
Miss Xiao,

18
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,680
come with us.

19
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,040
So it was you after all.

20
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,400
When did you start
suspecting me, General?

21
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:01,990
I've always been a cautious man.

22
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,529
There are only
a few people I truly trust.

23
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:05,480
And you...

24
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,760
You were once one of them.

25
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,950
That is precisely why

26
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,510
I noticed something was off about you.

27
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,200
How so?

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,630
From what I know of you,

29
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,479
you would never have allowed

30
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,999
Xiao Ningyun to be taken away
and returned

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,040
on your own.

32
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:28,600
General, aren't you being too hasty?

33
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,830
I was seriously injured,

34
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:32,200
outnumbered,

35
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,440
and a pursuit would've
meant certain death.

36
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:36,630
Reporting back and requesting backups

37
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,630
was the wisest choice.

38
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:41,230
Shi Ying.

39
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:44,110
I know you too well.

40
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,000
If you were loyal to me,

41
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,999
you would have risked your life

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,929
to get her back.

43
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:51,070
If you didn't,

44
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,200
then you were no longer loyal to me.

45
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,350
So,

46
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,760
you deliberately
had me investigate the token.

47
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,280
That's right.

48
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:03,439
I didn't expect you to

49
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,790
shift all the blame onto Xu Yunze.

50
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,200
Why haven't you taken action?

51
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:10,559
If I had, how would I've learned

52
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,849
about your plan?

53
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:12,719
How would I have known

54
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,230
who you truly serve?

55
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,319
So, do you know now?

56
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,110
Of course.

57
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,110
As you know,

58
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:25,209
I originally

59
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:26,719
planned to help Xiao Ningyun
and Xu Yunze

60
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,719
escape.

61
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,070
But after I found out
you worked for Cai Jiuzhang,

62
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,950
I changed my plan.

63
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:34,760
Another group of my secret guards

64
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,999
discovered that some of

65
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,209
Cai Jiuzhang's assassins

66
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:37,929
were carrying tokens

67
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:39,790
identical to yours.

68
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,600
You all acted far too hastily.

69
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:47,849
You even forged my orders

70
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:49,599
and insisted on escorting Xiao Ningyun.

71
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,630
From that moment, I knew

72
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,439
I couldn't let them leave.

73
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,350
Otherwise, you'd silence them all.

74
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:00,720
So, I intercepted them.

75
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:03,950
But you ended up
trapping yourself instead.

76
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:05,910
General.

77
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:07,879
You once revoked

78
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,040
the Xiao family's status as outcasts.

79
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:12,230
It earned you great fame.

80
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,760
But the people only know of the General,

81
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,470
not of His Majesty.

82
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,950
So, is it all my fault?

83
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,710
To win the people's favor, His Majesty
sought to win over the Xiao family.

84
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,849
He personally made
Xiao Zijin the Duke of Anding.

85
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,680
That was his first move.

86
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:28,320
But now, General,

87
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,200
you intend to marry a convicted traitor.

88
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:33,440
His Majesty and the grand chancellor

89
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,000
would ever approve.

90
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,200
So, the grand chancellor framed me
as the one who killed Xiao Zijin.

91
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:40,200
A brilliant move.

92
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,950
Not only did it
make Ningyun distrust me,

93
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,830
but it also made everyone believe

94
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:45,919
I murdered

95
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,030
the very Duke of Anding whom His Majesty

96
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:49,800
had personally appointed.

97
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:52,480
Meanwhile, the grand chancellor
sent his daughter to the palace.

98
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:54,329
First, as a hostage

99
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:55,830
to show his loyalty.

100
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,719
Second, to strengthen

101
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,150
his own power.

102
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:00,390
General,

103
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,510
you are a capable man.

104
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:06,150
You shouldn't throw it all away

105
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,470
for a woman.

106
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:12,449
Just take this

107
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:13,719
as a friendly warning

108
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,070
for old times' sake.

109
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,070
Rise.

110
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,590
Your Majesty.

111
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,449
The Xiao family has been destroyed.

112
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:47,240
I am no longer the third young lady.

113
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:50,030
When I took in the Xiao family,

114
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:52,440
I swore to treat its people well.

115
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,070
I even granted Xiao Zijin
the title of Duke of Anding.

116
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:58,470
But who knew that while
Uncle appeared virtuous,

117
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:00,320
he killed him behind my back.

118
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,159
But don't worry, Miss Ningyun.

119
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,470
I will give the Duke of Anding justice.

120
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:07,599
Here in the palace, you will live

121
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,390
no differently than royalty.

122
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:12,440
My uncle...

123
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:16,270
My uncle...

124
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:18,470
My uncle has no pity for beauty.

125
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,360
Your Majesty,

126
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:20,649
I am merely a convicted traitor.

127
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:22,089
I do not deserve such honor.

128
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,089
I ask Your Majesty

129
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:24,590
to let me live in seclusion.

130
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:27,920
It's hard to go from luxury to hardship.

131
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:28,889
Miss Ningyun,

132
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:30,479
you might as well stay here for now.

133
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,089
We'll think of a way later.

134
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:32,849
Your Majesty...

135
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:33,799
I'm busy.

136
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,830
I'll be going.

137
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:47,239
Your Highness.

138
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,359
His Majesty placed Xiao Ningyun

139
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,240
in his own side chamber.

140
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,680
That wretched woman again!

141
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,239
After seducing the General,

142
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,950
she's going after His Majesty now?

143
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:58,889
If she doesn't die,

144
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,560
I will never be at peace.

145
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:02,360
Who do you want to kill?

146
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:08,470
Your Majesty.

147
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:11,279
Xiao Ningyun is nothing but

148
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,390
a wicked temptress who brings ruin.

149
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:15,449
Don't be fooled by her

150
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:16,920
like Chen Fengxue was.

151
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,270
Or you'll end up
just like Chen Fengxue.

152
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:24,599
Cai Yuehan.

153
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,800
You'd best remember your place.

154
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:28,679
Did you think I married you

155
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,070
because I feared your father?

156
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:32,920
Your father needs my support.

157
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:33,969
Otherwise,

158
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:36,599
just the crime of framing
the general alone

159
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,470
could get your family executed.

160
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:42,000
I was so wrong about you.

161
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:46,240
Never too late to learn more.

162
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:06,710
Looks like

163
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,830
everything is settled.

164
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:12,320
Just think of it as repaying a favor.

165
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,449
I had someone impersonate Xiao Zijin.

166
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:15,920
He was seen on the streets.

167
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,590
Then, I had Xu Yunze

168
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,440
stage a public rescue.

169
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,009
So now, there's not enough evidence.

170
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:22,320
You're acquitted.

171
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,830
Now, we are even.

172
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,440
Next time we meet,

173
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:28,120
we'll be enemies.

174
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:30,150
One more thing.

175
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:31,630
Xiao Ningyun

176
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,320
is in His Majesty's hands.

177
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,719
My uncle's day has come.

178
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,519
Does this satisfy you, Miss Ningyun?

179
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,640
Satisfy what?

180
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:02,929
It's just kneeling.

181
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,089
He's not losing a limb.

182
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:06,230
The one taken might not
even be your brother.

183
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:08,440
It's just a way to clear his name.

184
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,800
I will make sure you're satisfied.

185
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:12,520
Go wait behind the screen.

186
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,590
Your Majesty,

187
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,350
please allow me
to leave with Xiao Ningyun.

188
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:33,040
Uncle, you're my own flesh and blood.

189
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,560
You raised me since I was young.

190
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:38,560
It is only right
that I grant you another chance.

191
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,200
However,

192
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,990
I have one condition.

193
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,710
I accept.

194
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:53,280
Good.

195
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:54,809
Straightforward as expected.

196
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:56,049
There's a hunt tomorrow.

197
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:58,400
If you secure the first kill,

198
00:09:58,570 --> 00:09:59,119
I will have

199
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,879
an excuse

200
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,759
to grant Xiao Ningyun to you.

201
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,110
All other crimes

202
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,400
will be overlooked.

203
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,800
It's a deal.

204
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:12,110
My heart

205
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,800
has always been with you, Uncle.

206
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,599
We must never

207
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,479
spill each other's blood.

208
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,520
It would only give outsiders
an opening.

209
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:49,639
Your Majesty,

210
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,280
since I am your good luck charm,

211
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,569
then let me

212
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:53,680
join the hunt.

213
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:55,230
Very well.

214
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:29,470
Uncle,

215
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,680
as long as you
walk out of here alive today,

216
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:34,470
I will overlook everything.

217
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:37,470
I'll hold you to it.

218
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:09,280
Uncle,

219
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:11,289
your taste in women

220
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:12,520
has never been wrong.

221
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:40,990
Xiao Ningyun.

222
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:43,950
Have I ever been in your heart?

223
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,350
Yes or no?

224
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,560
Answer me!
