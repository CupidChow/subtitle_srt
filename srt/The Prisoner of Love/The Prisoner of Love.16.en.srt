00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,540
=Episode 16=

3
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,130
No!

4
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:47,320
Miss Xiao!

5
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:48,880
You're finally awake!

6
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:50,530
Why am I still alive?

7
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:52,050
Thanks to him.

8
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,090
He saved you.

9
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,490
You were lucky.

10
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,009
I found wild red worms

11
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,600
in the mountains nearby.

12
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:00,410
Even without being nourished
by human blood,

13
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:01,739
they can still save your life.

14
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,320
But they cannot completely remove
the remaining poison in your body.

15
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:06,850
I see.

16
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,000
Miss Xiao.

17
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:18,210
Miss Xiao!

18
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:26,800
I forgot.

19
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:28,640
This poison causes

20
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,250
the loss of all five senses.

21
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:33,859
My eyes...

22
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,449
Your blindness is only temporary.

23
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:37,169
Once the remaining poison is removed,

24
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,059
your eyesight will return to normal.

25
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,050
Don't worry.

26
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:42,800
I'm tired.

27
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:45,210
I need sleep.

28
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,130
You should all go and rest as well.

29
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:07,560
The real pain starts now.

30
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:08,539
The red worm

31
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,680
will burrow into your bloodstream
from your left hand.

32
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:12,560
It will travel through your veins,

33
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,320
constantly feeding
on your essence and blood.

34
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,570
Once it's full,

35
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,680
it will exit from the veins

36
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:18,730
in your right hand.

37
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:22,840
Most people die

38
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,840
from blood depletion

39
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,920
before the red worm
even finishes feeding.

40
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:28,960
You are risking your life.

41
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:30,400
For her,

42
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,570
I have no regrets.

43
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,569
The wind is strong outside.

44
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:12,449
You came in

45
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:13,960
and blew out all my candles.

46
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,099
What are you doing?

47
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,169
I have many rare medicinal ingredients
in my room.

48
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:20,320
You won't be able to compensate me
if you damage them.

49
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,770
Where is he?

50
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,539
You must be seeing things.

51
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,680
I'm the only one here.

52
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,120
I know I saw someone else
in your room earlier.

53
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:30,520
Look.

54
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,819
What's more important? Miss Xiao's life

55
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,840
or these trivial matters?

56
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:35,769
You...

57
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:36,539
I'm warning you.

58
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,330
If this happens again, I won't care
whether Miss Xiao lives or dies.

59
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,129
Xu Yunze.

60
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,690
I want some water.

61
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,330
Why aren't you saying anything?

62
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,280
Who are you?

63
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,080
Did they...

64
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,520
Did they send you to take care of me?

65
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,840
Why aren't you speaking?

66
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:57,210
Can you...

67
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,400
Can you not speak?

68
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:00,930
Hey!

69
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,160
Is it you?

70
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,219
I want to rest for a bit.

71
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,640
Can you help me?

72
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,770
What's wrong?

73
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:31,049
The little mute caught a cold.

74
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:32,640
I'll take care of you, Miss Xiao.

75
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:37,720
Wait.

76
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,040
If my sight

77
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,890
recovers tomorrow,

78
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:42,369
I want you

79
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:43,960
to be the first I see.

80
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:05,280
The red worm is full,
but it doesn't want to come out.

81
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:10,210
I'll cut it out.

82
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:11,370
No!

83
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,010
That will harm your qi and blood!

84
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,210
How are you feeling?

85
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:49,840
Miss Xiao.

86
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:50,720
Here.

87
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:02,899
Miss Xiao!

88
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,960
Are you all right?

89
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,579
I can see!

90
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,539
I can see you!

91
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,219
Miss Xiao.

92
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,489
You can finally see me!

93
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:21,339
Where is the mute

94
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,080
who took care of me the past few days?

95
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:31,160
Oh, him?

96
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:32,649
He was just a local villager

97
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,120
from these mountains.

98
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,360
Now that you're healed,

99
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:36,769
he's probably gone off

100
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:38,050
wandering again.

101
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,720
Goodness.
Why isn't the medicine ready yet?

102
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,690
Wandering?

103
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,410
Why do you need this?

104
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:03,760
Wait.

105
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:04,760
If my sight

106
00:09:04,882 --> 00:09:06,682
recovers tomorrow,

107
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,099
I want you

108
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,840
to be the first I see.

109
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:13,979
Just to pass time.

110
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:14,769
Mr. Xu,

111
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:16,240
you should go rest now.

112
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,290
Chen Fengxue!
