00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,540
=Episode 4=

3
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:48,640
I'll make sure you live a luxury life!

4
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,920
Who allowed you to lay hands
on my woman?

5
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:01,390
Uncle,

6
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,200
that is out of line.

7
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,840
We cannot explain this to Chu.

8
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:07,480
If Chu wants to start something,

9
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,590
tell them to come
to the General's Mansion.

10
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,280
No one can touch

11
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:12,710
what's mine.

12
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,120
Not even if it is just an ant.

13
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,920
Uncle, you intrigue me.

14
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,680
Move again and I won't hesitate to add
another broken bone to your tally.

15
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,590
Why the pretense of kindness?

16
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,870
Dare you say
you didn't arrange the show today?

17
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,590
Still so presumptuous.

18
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,680
Who can match you

19
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,750
when it comes to that?

20
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,400
And on top of that,
you've got a persecution complex.

21
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,360
You think everyone's out to get you.

22
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,520
Halt right there.

23
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,240
(The Xiao family's guard)
What do you think you're doing?

24
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,760
How dare you snoop
around the Xiao Mansion?

25
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,680
You look like a spy up to no good.

26
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,160
If you're set on accusing someone,
you'll never be short of excuses.

27
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,030
Then, I'll make sure you confess.

28
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:11,120
You're quite tough.

29
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:13,120
Let's see how many whips you can take!

30
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:15,870
Stop!

31
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:18,840
Miss Xiao.

32
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,280
All of you, stand down.

33
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,720
I will interrogate him myself.

34
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,240
Yes, Miss Xiao. Let's go.

35
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,560
Chen Fengxue.

36
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:34,910
It's you again.

37
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,150
Didn't expect you

38
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,190
to be tough

39
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,080
and tight-lipped.

40
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,080
I like that about you.

41
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,030
Our families have never gotten along.
I am hardly worthy of your affection.

42
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,280
I don't like

43
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,800
things I like being imperfect.

44
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:57,910
Let's go.

45
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,630
Yes.

46
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,240
(Why doesn't he remember)

47
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,360
(how I once treated him?)

48
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,270
You keep staring at me.

49
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,270
Are you trying to seduce me?

50
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,120
I wouldn't mind

51
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,000
satisfying you.

52
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,270
You're right.

53
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,560
I am trying to seduce you.

54
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,190
But are you even up for it?

55
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:38,870
Don't touch me

56
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,120
with that filthy hand

57
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,520
that Chu's grubby envoy has touched.

58
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:42,720
Disgusting.

59
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:45,870
Men.

60
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:46,240
Present.

61
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,720
Lock Xiao Ningyun in the woodshed
for three days

62
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,600
and give her no food.

63
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,950
Give her all of the most

64
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,240
degrading chores in the mansion.

65
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:56,160
Yes, sir.

66
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:07,270
Sir, I heard you actually locked her
in the woodshed and made her a slave.

67
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,040
You... You always let your anger
get the best of you.

68
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,120
You really shouldn't...

69
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,040
If you break the medicine mule
we worked so hard to find,

70
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,430
it'll be your life on the line.

71
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:19,000
There's no beast that can't be tamed.

72
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:20,270
If there is,

73
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,190
it just means
you weren't ruthless enough.

74
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,360
I worry you're being too ruthless.

75
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,830
You could lose

76
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,920
everything

77
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,070
in the process.

78
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,950
If my mule dies,

79
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,240
I die.

80
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,870
You should worry about your own life.

81
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,630
Talking to someone
as cold-hearted as you

82
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,040
is pointless.

83
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,600
Forget it.

84
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,430
As long as she's still alive,
I can save her.

85
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,750
Sir, they've taken the bait.

86
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,510
Miss Xiao.

87
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,380
(Xu Yunze, the Xiao family's guard)

88
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,310
Why are you here?

89
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,830
I received Zhao Yan's report

90
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,920
and found out you were being held
as a slave in the General's Mansion.

91
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:35,950
It's nothing too bad.

92
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:37,630
But what about you and Zijin?

93
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,070
How is he?

94
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,830
Mr. Xiao has been rescued.
I'll get you out of here tonight.

95
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,270
Who's there?

96
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:43,360
Come on!

97
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,120
Madam Liu.

98
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,270
You wretch!

99
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,680
How dare you have an affair!

100
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,920
So desperate?

101
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,160
Then I'll let you have your fill of men!

102
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,750
That might not be a good idea.

103
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,080
What's wrong with it?
General Chen is already tired of her.

104
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:01,950
She's nothing

105
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,190
but a lowly servant now!

106
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,040
I see.

107
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,430
Then I won't hold back.

108
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,430
Don't come any closer...
Stay away!

109
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,680
Don't come near me!

110
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:14,510
Go away!

111
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,120
What's going on?

112
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:33,720
You were lucky I was there.

113
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,480
Listen,

114
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,600
General Chen yields to softness,
not force.

115
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,190
If you keep resisting,

116
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:42,390
next time you won't be so lucky
for me to save you.

117
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,720
You don't know him.

118
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,120
If he wanted to torment me,

119
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,430
he wouldn't need me to provoke him.

120
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,190
You still don't see it.

121
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,870
He's already been good to you.

122
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:02,920
There, all fixed.

123
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:07,630
He allowed you

124
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,800
to heal my hand?

125
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,630
Of course.

126
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,600
How can I draw blood otherwise?

127
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,670
Are you trying to kill me?

128
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,720
You're overthinking it.

129
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,120
I just wanted

130
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,480
to tuck you in.

131
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,120
Looks like dislocating your arm that day

132
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,200
didn't teach you a lesson.

133
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:16,840
Is my blood

134
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,440
not enough for you?

135
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,390
Of course not.

136
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:51,390
Why?

137
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,000
Why can't I still stand up?

138
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,480
Why? Why?

139
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,270
Are you mocking me?

140
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,270
Get out!

141
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,000
Get lost

142
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,120
before I kill you!

143
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,840
(I will leave.)

144
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:14,320
(Far, far away.)

145
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,240
(And we will never meet again.)

146
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,030
Put this on.

147
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:31,600
We're leaving.

148
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,120
Let's go.

149
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:53,670
Miss Xiao.

150
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,790
Where do you think you're going?
