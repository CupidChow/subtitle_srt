00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,300
This series is based on a fictionalized story inspired by the story of BTS's album,
The Most Beautiful Moment in Life,
and is not related to BTS members and their families.

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,300
Child actors and animals were filmed
in safe conditions under the supervision of their guardians.

3
00:00:13,016 --> 00:00:15,209
Why isn't he home yet?

4
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:20,186
He's not even answering his phone

5
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:22,559
Where did he go?

6
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:26,173
I'm worried sick

7
00:00:33,148 --> 00:00:34,551
What if he fainted?

8
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:37,027
Oh, my...

9
00:00:40,468 --> 00:00:41,431
Hosu

10
00:00:44,394 --> 00:00:45,458
Hosu

11
00:00:52,918 --> 00:00:54,206
Hosu Jeong

12
00:00:58,127 --> 00:01:00,552
Why isn't he answering his phone?

13
00:01:03,401 --> 00:01:04,421
Hosu

14
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,901
Hosu

15
00:01:09,221 --> 00:01:10,292
Hosu!

16
00:01:16,938 --> 00:01:18,039
Oh, my

17
00:01:19,251 --> 00:01:20,295
Hosu

18
00:01:22,192 --> 00:01:24,000
What are you doing here?

19
00:01:24,378 --> 00:01:25,477
Are you alright?

20
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:26,930
Let me look at you

21
00:01:27,454 --> 00:01:29,697
Why didn't you answer your phone?

22
00:01:31,106 --> 00:01:32,321
- Mrs. Kim
- Yes?

23
00:01:36,143 --> 00:01:37,675
I couldn't answer it

24
00:01:40,774 --> 00:01:41,780
Are you alright?

25
00:01:46,581 --> 00:01:47,650
What's this?

26
00:01:53,558 --> 00:01:54,716
What is this?

27
00:01:57,589 --> 00:01:58,587
Is this...

28
00:01:59,674 --> 00:02:00,756
Is this oil?

29
00:02:03,404 --> 00:02:04,546
Where did you...

30
00:02:12,746 --> 00:02:13,833
Hosu

31
00:02:14,677 --> 00:02:15,724
You...

32
00:02:17,741 --> 00:02:18,876
What did you do?

33
00:03:32,288 --> 00:03:33,308
Mom

34
00:03:38,372 --> 00:03:39,809
It wasn't you

35
00:03:39,811 --> 00:03:41,019
who fainted?

36
00:03:45,279 --> 00:03:46,158
Are you...

37
00:03:47,456 --> 00:03:49,537
Are you hurt?

38
00:03:50,927 --> 00:03:52,573
Hosu suddenly collapsed

39
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,772
Mom

40
00:04:00,371 --> 00:04:01,800
Dear God, thank you

41
00:04:02,246 --> 00:04:03,649
Thank you so much

42
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,540
Thank you

43
00:04:05,961 --> 00:04:07,039
Thank you

44
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,188
Did anyone see you...

45
00:04:22,245 --> 00:04:23,308
coming here?

46
00:04:26,996 --> 00:04:28,525
Did you meet anyone on your way here?

47
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,354
I don't know

48
00:04:55,255 --> 00:04:56,701
Are you awake?

49
00:05:00,074 --> 00:05:02,404
Thank God, Buddha, and all other gods

50
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,278
Thank you

51
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:05,703
Why don't you

52
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:07,551
also thank the Chicken God?

53
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:13,325
Do you feel better now?

54
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:16,332
You!

55
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:17,739
I was so surprised

56
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,743
that I wore the wrong pair of slippers

57
00:05:22,654 --> 00:05:24,873
What on earth happened to you?

58
00:05:26,969 --> 00:05:28,051
Do you remember...

59
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:30,651
why you fainted?

60
00:05:38,276 --> 00:05:39,285
Again?

61
00:05:45,214 --> 00:05:46,690
I think I saw my mom again

62
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:50,184
- Hosu
- I know

63
00:05:51,654 --> 00:05:52,859
I know it's not her

64
00:05:57,681 --> 00:05:59,788
But I thought I did

65
00:06:01,681 --> 00:06:03,228
The camera movement was...

66
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:05,591
And this

67
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:08,032
To be honest, the camera moving...

68
00:06:14,031 --> 00:06:15,132
At least once,

69
00:06:16,776 --> 00:06:18,346
wouldn't she come to see me?

70
00:06:20,325 --> 00:06:21,483
At least once

71
00:06:38,612 --> 00:06:40,676
Do you want to eat friend chicken later?

72
00:06:41,747 --> 00:06:43,718
It was the first thing you said
after you woke up

73
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,235
By the way

74
00:06:47,236 --> 00:06:49,151
- how did I get here?
- What?

75
00:06:50,323 --> 00:06:52,726
- Did Haru call for help?
- Yes

76
00:06:55,182 --> 00:06:58,070
He seemed to be surprised as well

77
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:00,218
Where is he now?

78
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:03,299
His mom came

79
00:07:03,904 --> 00:07:05,357
I told him I'll let him know

80
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:06,942
once you wake up

81
00:07:09,203 --> 00:07:12,533
It seems Haru...

82
00:07:13,087 --> 00:07:14,477
isn't so well either

83
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:16,895
Haru?

84
00:07:17,858 --> 00:07:18,862
Why do you say that?

85
00:07:21,299 --> 00:07:24,653
His hands were also all bloodied up

86
00:07:24,654 --> 00:07:26,447
so I went out to clean his hands

87
00:07:27,565 --> 00:07:29,179
I overheard the conversation

88
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,108
between him and his mom

89
00:07:32,103 --> 00:07:34,409
You didn't tell him, did you?

90
00:07:36,503 --> 00:07:37,506
Did you?

91
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:39,611
I told you you'll need to move

92
00:07:39,612 --> 00:07:41,044
to another school if the rumor spreads

93
00:07:42,425 --> 00:07:43,501
I didn't tell him

94
00:07:47,188 --> 00:07:48,969
It might be hard for you too

95
00:07:50,008 --> 00:07:51,985
but it's hard for us as well

96
00:07:51,986 --> 00:07:53,813
transferring schools every time

97
00:07:54,371 --> 00:07:55,355
Do you understand?

98
00:07:56,432 --> 00:07:57,692
I'm sorry

99
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:04,323
Let's go home

100
00:08:04,325 --> 00:08:05,750
before someone sees us

101
00:08:06,496 --> 00:08:07,590
Mom

102
00:08:09,093 --> 00:08:10,488
Can I just check

103
00:08:10,489 --> 00:08:11,966
whether Hosu's awake?

104
00:08:11,967 --> 00:08:15,001
- Haru Park, you...
- Oh, you were here

105
00:08:18,053 --> 00:08:19,143
Um

106
00:08:19,495 --> 00:08:21,943
Hosu's breathing is stable

107
00:08:21,944 --> 00:08:23,282
and he's okay now

108
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:26,858
- Just in case you were worried
- Really?

109
00:08:29,731 --> 00:08:30,798
That's good news

110
00:08:31,709 --> 00:08:33,135
You must be his mother

111
00:08:34,962 --> 00:08:37,494
You must be very surprised too

112
00:08:37,495 --> 00:08:38,411
Are you alright?

113
00:08:38,781 --> 00:08:39,891
No, I'm fine

114
00:08:40,276 --> 00:08:42,271
It's good to hear he's okay

115
00:08:44,372 --> 00:08:45,461
Haru

116
00:08:50,338 --> 00:08:51,800
If you weren't there

117
00:08:51,802 --> 00:08:54,593
things might've gone out of control

118
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:56,643
Thank you so much

119
00:08:58,234 --> 00:09:00,398
You must be proud

120
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,909
to have such a kind-hearted son

121
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:05,363
Haru, let's go

122
00:09:15,936 --> 00:09:17,192
What kind of a story

123
00:09:17,194 --> 00:09:18,581
would a young boy like him have?

124
00:09:35,609 --> 00:09:36,618
Hosu!

125
00:09:36,891 --> 00:09:37,875
Are you okay now?

126
00:09:38,349 --> 00:09:40,250
What about your head? You bled quite a lot

127
00:09:40,952 --> 00:09:42,018
I guess you were surprised

128
00:09:43,004 --> 00:09:44,082
I'm sorry

129
00:09:44,725 --> 00:09:45,878
No, I'm fine...

130
00:09:50,663 --> 00:09:52,063
I told you I live in an orphanage

131
00:09:53,942 --> 00:09:55,091
I was abandoned when I was young

132
00:09:58,363 --> 00:09:59,506
Have you heard of Hana Land?

133
00:10:01,287 --> 00:10:02,620
I was about five

134
00:10:07,216 --> 00:10:09,219
My mom took me there for my birthday

135
00:10:11,179 --> 00:10:13,074
I was having a good time

136
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:53,031
She told me to wait for a while

137
00:10:53,032 --> 00:10:54,093
and that she'll be back soon

138
00:10:56,741 --> 00:10:58,254
That was the last time I saw her

139
00:11:00,655 --> 00:11:02,280
Since then, whenever I think about my mom

140
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,129
or see someone who looks like her,

141
00:11:05,934 --> 00:11:07,409
my head goes blank

142
00:11:09,856 --> 00:11:11,809
I think that's why I fainted yesterday

143
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:15,501
Because of the narcolepsy

144
00:11:15,502 --> 00:11:17,407
I went for psychiatric counseling
and took medicines

145
00:11:18,742 --> 00:11:19,805
but they're not helping

146
00:11:22,188 --> 00:11:24,465
You're in the last place

147
00:11:24,466 --> 00:11:26,739
- Try to do better
- Oh, shoot, I'm screwed

148
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,835
Jeez

149
00:11:29,199 --> 00:11:30,235
Junho Jang

150
00:11:33,562 --> 00:11:34,786
Only two people are behind you, two

151
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,586
Ranking by class: 13/21
Ranking by school: 63/174

152
00:11:41,646 --> 00:11:42,797
Attention, everyone!

153
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,726
Don't get disappointed

154
00:11:45,988 --> 00:11:48,041
I hope you'll be happier

155
00:11:48,043 --> 00:11:49,715
when you get your final exam results

156
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,971
- Okay
- Okay

157
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:52,565
- Attention
- We'll skip that today

158
00:11:53,201 --> 00:11:54,255
Hwan Kim

159
00:11:54,956 --> 00:11:56,653
Follow me to the principal's office

160
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:11,498
Of course, it'll take time...

161
00:12:12,658 --> 00:12:14,821
to adjust to the Korean school system

162
00:12:16,439 --> 00:12:17,562
But

163
00:12:18,694 --> 00:12:20,538
your father,

164
00:12:21,075 --> 00:12:23,335
who expects a lot from you,

165
00:12:27,084 --> 00:12:28,609
will be disappointed with your results

166
00:12:32,539 --> 00:12:37,235
I'll also think about how I can be of help

167
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:39,096
but in the end

168
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,866
it depends on your determination

169
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:48,970
Try to follow the steps
of your excellent father

170
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:10,486
Ranking by class: 1/19
Ranking by school: 1/152

171
00:13:17,468 --> 00:13:18,454
You're here

172
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:20,277
Yeah

173
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:22,585
What about your lunch?

174
00:13:23,524 --> 00:13:24,876
I have no appetite

175
00:13:26,622 --> 00:13:27,690
Eating bread as well?

176
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:31,116
Yeah, I also don't have my appetite

177
00:13:31,851 --> 00:13:32,871
You want some?

178
00:13:42,645 --> 00:13:43,656
Thank you

179
00:13:52,478 --> 00:13:53,573
Did anyone...

180
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:55,531
buy your bike?

181
00:13:55,712 --> 00:13:56,745
Oh, yes

182
00:13:57,389 --> 00:13:59,011
Thankfully, the buyer waited for me

183
00:14:01,013 --> 00:14:03,983
Even after selling the bike,
I'm short of 200,000 won

184
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:05,961
so I'm sending the settlement fee

185
00:14:05,962 --> 00:14:07,371
as soon as
I get my container part-time wage

186
00:14:15,095 --> 00:14:19,526
What would be the best way
to cheer you up?

187
00:14:20,063 --> 00:14:21,113
After this,

188
00:14:21,628 --> 00:14:23,012
I'll treat you at the convenience store

189
00:14:23,515 --> 00:14:24,682
That will do

190
00:14:27,302 --> 00:14:29,866
Okay, I'll treat you
at the convenience store after this

191
00:14:30,093 --> 00:14:31,107
Good

192
00:14:33,104 --> 00:14:34,106
Hey

193
00:14:35,448 --> 00:14:36,410
What's this?

194
00:14:37,557 --> 00:14:38,864
You said you aren't eating

195
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:42,847
Shouldn't have bought this

196
00:14:43,722 --> 00:14:44,862
Give it to me. I'll eat it

197
00:14:45,008 --> 00:14:46,358
Forget it. I'm going to eat it all

198
00:14:48,724 --> 00:14:49,820
Are you?

199
00:14:52,107 --> 00:14:53,732
Jooan, can I have a bite?

200
00:14:57,043 --> 00:14:58,078
Have everything. All of it

201
00:14:59,581 --> 00:15:01,295
Right, you always have a big heart

202
00:15:01,296 --> 00:15:02,389
My mouth almost burst

203
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,498
- Haru, let's share this
- Okay

204
00:15:28,797 --> 00:15:29,876
Hey, it's dangerous

205
00:15:29,877 --> 00:15:30,952
Do it over there

206
00:15:31,119 --> 00:15:32,061
Why?

207
00:15:33,211 --> 00:15:34,330
It didn't hit him

208
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:38,318
Hey, Jooan

209
00:15:38,319 --> 00:15:39,719
Want to play catch ball outside?

210
00:15:40,525 --> 00:15:41,545
No

211
00:15:43,764 --> 00:15:45,495
I said stop it

212
00:15:45,705 --> 00:15:46,905
No, it's okay

213
00:15:59,152 --> 00:16:01,692
Why is he standing there?

214
00:16:03,706 --> 00:16:04,783
Hey, Jooan Kim

215
00:16:12,283 --> 00:16:13,352
Let's talk outside

216
00:16:40,628 --> 00:16:41,894
I knew this would happen

217
00:16:42,964 --> 00:16:45,332
Jooan's good at fighting though?

218
00:16:46,144 --> 00:16:47,215
Nothing will happen to Hwan, right?

219
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:49,498
- He knows what he's doing
- Stand here

220
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:52,395
We should stop them if it gets bad, right?

221
00:16:54,952 --> 00:16:56,091
Is Hwan good at fighting?

222
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,677
Should I stay close to him?

223
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,365
Shh, keep quiet

224
00:17:00,492 --> 00:17:01,860
I can't hear them, shh

225
00:17:01,967 --> 00:17:03,935
I hurt my wrist yesterday

226
00:17:12,203 --> 00:17:14,781
- Oh, they're going at it
- Oh

227
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:17,396
What?

228
00:17:17,681 --> 00:17:18,719
Jooan's scared?

229
00:17:19,537 --> 00:17:20,894
You said he's good at fighting

230
00:17:21,022 --> 00:17:22,039
It'll be okay

231
00:17:22,172 --> 00:17:23,540
Kids grow up fighting

232
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:24,541
Yeah, you're right

233
00:17:26,452 --> 00:17:27,537
Wh, what?

234
00:17:30,914 --> 00:17:31,900
A handshake?

235
00:17:32,307 --> 00:17:33,318
That's a first

236
00:17:34,468 --> 00:17:35,432
I'm sorry

237
00:17:41,804 --> 00:17:43,693
for misunderstanding you and Dogeon

238
00:17:45,094 --> 00:17:46,148
I'm sorry

239
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,079
I wanted to apologize properly

240
00:17:58,262 --> 00:17:59,281
Ah, well...

241
00:18:00,764 --> 00:18:02,328
That's why you called me outside?

242
00:18:03,592 --> 00:18:04,564
Yeah

243
00:18:06,394 --> 00:18:08,842
I was also in the wrong

244
00:18:10,311 --> 00:18:11,417
I'm sorry, too

245
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:14,836
including the ball I threw at you earlier

246
00:18:15,218 --> 00:18:16,197
Including that

247
00:18:19,419 --> 00:18:20,434
Okay

248
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:25,634
Do you want to go to the snack bar?

249
00:18:26,391 --> 00:18:27,352
Yes!

250
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:29,273
Me too

251
00:18:30,478 --> 00:18:31,598
Can't miss out on the snack bar

252
00:18:32,252 --> 00:18:33,335
When...

253
00:18:34,975 --> 00:18:36,185
- It's on me
- Milk for me

254
00:18:36,186 --> 00:18:37,688
- I want a chocolate bar
- Hot dog for me

255
00:18:37,689 --> 00:18:39,046
- I'll have anything
- Sausage stick

256
00:18:40,358 --> 00:18:42,514
- What? You, too?
- I raised my hand

257
00:18:45,401 --> 00:18:46,631
Not going? Let's go!

258
00:18:47,712 --> 00:18:49,903
- Let's go!
- I'm going, too!

259
00:18:51,894 --> 00:18:53,512
What do you want? Let's go together

260
00:18:53,817 --> 00:18:54,830
I...

261
00:18:56,003 --> 00:18:58,378
want boiled eggs

262
00:19:03,953 --> 00:19:05,029
Wait for me

263
00:19:23,001 --> 00:19:24,141
Did you have your meal?

264
00:19:24,787 --> 00:19:25,917
Tomorrow's your birthday

265
00:19:26,066 --> 00:19:27,600
Eat something nice with your friends

266
00:19:28,372 --> 00:19:29,379
Happy birthday

267
00:19:30,062 --> 00:19:31,205
and let's eat together on the weekend

268
00:19:31,877 --> 00:19:32,923
We'll have a cake, too

269
00:19:33,323 --> 00:19:34,375
Guys

270
00:19:35,651 --> 00:19:37,168
Tomorrow's Cein's birthday

271
00:19:37,463 --> 00:19:38,493
How about giving him

272
00:19:38,494 --> 00:19:39,744
a surprise party?

273
00:19:40,511 --> 00:19:41,545
Cein's father

274
00:19:41,546 --> 00:19:42,826
always comes late on Saturdays

275
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:44,286
so I don't think he'll make it

276
00:19:44,654 --> 00:19:45,619
Good idea

277
00:19:46,265 --> 00:19:47,741
What should we get for him?

278
00:19:48,227 --> 00:19:50,014
What would he need?

279
00:19:51,259 --> 00:19:52,696
I always see him lying down

280
00:19:52,998 --> 00:19:53,999
Oh!

281
00:19:54,841 --> 00:19:56,210
He listens to music a lot

282
00:19:56,462 --> 00:19:58,018
How about wireless earphones?

283
00:19:59,293 --> 00:20:01,001
The one he's using now is all tangled up

284
00:20:01,277 --> 00:20:02,522
like a ball

285
00:20:02,658 --> 00:20:04,193
- Sounds good
- Right?

286
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:05,945
Whoa

287
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:09,711
The wireless one costs 190,000 won!

288
00:20:10,654 --> 00:20:11,705
It's super expensive

289
00:20:12,974 --> 00:20:14,653
I have some pocket money saved

290
00:20:14,654 --> 00:20:15,603
80,000 won

291
00:20:16,751 --> 00:20:17,784
Come on, cough up some money

292
00:20:18,324 --> 00:20:19,364
Is this it?

293
00:20:19,546 --> 00:20:21,235
Indeed, born with the silver spoon

294
00:20:21,372 --> 00:20:22,627
Where in the world would we have money?

295
00:20:23,562 --> 00:20:24,642
Rest of us are born with plastic spoons

296
00:20:32,213 --> 00:20:33,223
Ah

297
00:20:34,514 --> 00:20:36,145
I spent quite a lot

298
00:20:36,146 --> 00:20:37,320
in the convenience store

299
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:40,937
I think I have 50,000 won at home

300
00:20:41,226 --> 00:20:42,325
Okay

301
00:20:42,401 --> 00:20:44,819
Then 80,000 won from Jeha

302
00:20:45,149 --> 00:20:46,277
50,000 won from Hwan

303
00:20:47,295 --> 00:20:48,852
We're short of 60,000 won

304
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:50,826
Should we work part-time?

305
00:20:51,531 --> 00:20:53,317
If we work at a fish market at daybreak

306
00:20:53,464 --> 00:20:54,768
we might get some good wage

307
00:20:54,826 --> 00:20:56,945
Yes for me

308
00:20:57,067 --> 00:20:58,822
Me too. Definitely yes!

309
00:20:59,154 --> 00:21:00,522
Me too. I'll join too!

310
00:21:01,052 --> 00:21:02,101
It'll be fun

311
00:21:02,102 --> 00:21:03,740
I don't think I can join you

312
00:21:05,393 --> 00:21:07,317
I'll prepare for the party and the cake

313
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:09,075
Okay

314
00:21:09,076 --> 00:21:10,145
Now, we just have to keep it

315
00:21:10,146 --> 00:21:11,205
secret from Cein

316
00:21:12,741 --> 00:21:14,759
Are you the only one who doesn't know?

317
00:21:18,205 --> 00:21:19,738
The fact that I'm aware of it

318
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:21,913
means it's pretty widespread

319
00:21:22,366 --> 00:21:23,725
You stole a bike

320
00:21:23,727 --> 00:21:26,170
from junior high school students?

321
00:21:30,031 --> 00:21:31,512
I think you heard it wrong

322
00:21:32,788 --> 00:21:34,475
I didn't steal the bike

323
00:21:34,476 --> 00:21:36,010
They stole the bike from Hwan

324
00:21:36,011 --> 00:21:37,311
and I found it for him

325
00:21:37,647 --> 00:21:38,881
Why would you do that?

326
00:21:39,273 --> 00:21:40,208
Unnecessarily?

327
00:21:43,868 --> 00:21:45,329
I didn't realize finding my friend's bike

328
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:46,863
would get me in trouble

329
00:21:46,864 --> 00:21:48,721
If you threatened them with a knife

330
00:21:48,722 --> 00:21:50,812
of course, it'll get you in trouble

331
00:21:52,195 --> 00:21:53,338
Shit

332
00:21:55,799 --> 00:21:58,050
- I heard you
- Don't come near me

333
00:21:58,051 --> 00:21:59,671
threatened them with a knife

334
00:22:00,061 --> 00:22:01,197
I'll stab you

335
00:22:04,494 --> 00:22:06,456
You threatened to kill them
if they don't hand in the bike

336
00:22:07,709 --> 00:22:08,762
Go ahead

337
00:22:11,892 --> 00:22:13,143
I'm not scared of dying

338
00:22:17,295 --> 00:22:18,523
Let's get out of here

339
00:22:25,458 --> 00:22:26,679
Can't believe they had a knife...

340
00:22:29,442 --> 00:22:30,622
There's a rumor

341
00:22:30,822 --> 00:22:32,493
that you carry a knife even to school

342
00:22:34,442 --> 00:22:35,687
If this continues,

343
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:39,352
I can't lift

344
00:22:39,819 --> 00:22:41,033
the disciplinary action against you

345
00:22:45,691 --> 00:22:47,659
Even if I work hard,

346
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:50,319
you won't lift it for me

347
00:22:54,294 --> 00:22:55,626
Why do you think that?

348
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:57,480
I'm used to it

349
00:22:59,092 --> 00:23:01,073
Looking at those faces who don't like me

350
00:23:03,036 --> 00:23:04,698
Those faces who love to hate me

351
00:23:06,261 --> 00:23:08,706
without any reason

352
00:23:09,848 --> 00:23:10,913
Coming late to classes

353
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:13,738
unauthorized absence,
unauthorized leave, violence

354
00:23:14,448 --> 00:23:16,635
If these don't serve as reasons, what will?

355
00:23:22,742 --> 00:23:23,821
If

356
00:23:23,822 --> 00:23:25,416
you don't cooperate,

357
00:23:25,417 --> 00:23:26,442
The Sixth Songho Scholarship Foundation

358
00:23:26,443 --> 00:23:27,887
as the school principal,

359
00:23:27,888 --> 00:23:29,546
I can't help but make my decision

360
00:23:29,547 --> 00:23:30,517
The Eighth Songho Scholarship Foundation

361
00:23:30,518 --> 00:23:32,327
To protect other students,

362
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,621
I might have to consider expulsion

363
00:23:51,518 --> 00:23:52,694
Where's your greeting?

364
00:23:56,103 --> 00:23:57,218
I said my greeting earlier

365
00:23:57,219 --> 00:23:58,545
Don't talk back at me

366
00:24:00,432 --> 00:24:01,949
What are you staring at?

367
00:24:03,758 --> 00:24:05,546
I heard you got into trouble again

368
00:24:06,075 --> 00:24:06,874
Huh?

369
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:07,992
Why are you

370
00:24:08,288 --> 00:24:09,839
even coming to school? Why?

371
00:24:09,973 --> 00:24:11,463
Why? Huh?

372
00:24:12,645 --> 00:24:14,239
This blockhead

373
00:24:39,833 --> 00:24:40,752
Huh?

374
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,409
Cein isn't in school now

375
00:24:43,243 --> 00:24:44,255
He's not in school?

376
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,503
How do you know?

377
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:48,976
I have my ways

378
00:24:49,995 --> 00:24:51,217
Now that he's gone,

379
00:24:51,409 --> 00:24:52,556
let's make our plan in peace

380
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:53,546
I say

381
00:24:53,547 --> 00:24:54,726
he'll find out about our plan

382
00:24:55,651 --> 00:24:57,230
That elderly catches on quick

383
00:24:57,231 --> 00:24:58,517
We can't afford that

384
00:24:58,866 --> 00:25:00,250
Without him noticing,

385
00:25:00,886 --> 00:25:02,542
we have to bring him to the dry container

386
00:25:04,772 --> 00:25:06,438
Are you good at bluffing?

387
00:25:08,564 --> 00:25:09,671
Why me?

388
00:25:10,973 --> 00:25:12,126
Why me?

389
00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:13,997
Just asking

390
00:25:15,993 --> 00:25:18,220
Oh, look

391
00:25:21,385 --> 00:25:22,627
With those eyes, it wouldn't work

392
00:25:23,779 --> 00:25:25,312
Jeha, you do know

393
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:26,860
that I'm older than you, right?

394
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:28,366
Yup

395
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,235
Is there anyone

396
00:25:32,236 --> 00:25:33,525
whom he won't suspect and

397
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:35,649
who isn't close enough

398
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:37,350
that he can't even refuse?

399
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,207
I also agree on that

400
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:56,421
Me?

401
00:25:59,728 --> 00:26:00,829
Seriously, me?

402
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,862
I...

403
00:26:03,463 --> 00:26:04,488
Guys

404
00:26:04,489 --> 00:26:07,097
How about I fork out more money?

405
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:08,671
Guys, what else

406
00:26:08,797 --> 00:26:10,061
should we prepare for the party?

407
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:12,954
- Balloons, firecrackers, and...
- Guys

408
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:38,545
Excuse me

409
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,389
Sir

410
00:26:44,883 --> 00:26:45,938
You should go home

411
00:26:50,278 --> 00:26:51,315
Cein?

412
00:26:51,951 --> 00:26:52,961
Yes

413
00:27:01,204 --> 00:27:02,575
No, I'm alright

414
00:27:04,779 --> 00:27:05,802
I'm okay

415
00:27:37,307 --> 00:27:38,319
Drink this

416
00:27:40,552 --> 00:27:41,623
No thanks

417
00:27:48,501 --> 00:27:49,558
Thank you

418
00:28:07,756 --> 00:28:08,819
I didn't do it

419
00:28:12,755 --> 00:28:13,779
Sorry?

420
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:16,925
Your mother

421
00:28:20,444 --> 00:28:21,604
I didn't kill her

422
00:28:30,094 --> 00:28:31,140
Me neither

423
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:33,807
The Seventh Songho Scholarship Foundation: Seonghun Kim, Changjun Kim, Eunjoo Kim, Wonjoong Byeon

424
00:29:33,809 --> 00:29:35,252
'Changjun Kim' 'Eunjoo Kim' 'Wonjoong Byeon'

425
00:29:54,191 --> 00:29:57,294
Right.
Let's meet up and go together at 11:30

426
00:30:08,433 --> 00:30:09,464
Why are you...

427
00:30:09,942 --> 00:30:11,055
What are you doing at my house?

428
00:30:11,995 --> 00:30:12,883
Um

429
00:30:15,254 --> 00:30:16,477
Your father was drunk

430
00:30:54,376 --> 00:30:55,634
The Seventh Songho Scholarship Foundation

431
00:30:55,635 --> 00:30:56,901
'Changjun Kim' 'Eunjoo Kim'

432
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:24,040
Sir

433
00:31:24,041 --> 00:31:25,820
It's a good day.
Please smile a little more

434
00:31:25,821 --> 00:31:27,354
Everyone, please smile broadly

435
00:31:27,355 --> 00:31:29,226
and look at the camera

436
00:31:29,381 --> 00:31:31,178
One, two, three

437
00:31:32,166 --> 00:31:33,760
It's done

438
00:31:33,761 --> 00:31:34,892
Thank you

439
00:31:42,076 --> 00:31:44,124
- Hello
- Ah, hello

440
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,854
Mrs. Jeong

441
00:31:53,218 --> 00:31:54,241
Oh, Dogeon

442
00:31:54,332 --> 00:31:55,331
Thank you

443
00:31:55,769 --> 00:31:58,189
Dogeon, you're a scholarship student now

444
00:31:58,190 --> 00:31:59,262
You can't work anymore, okay?

445
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,002
There's a promise I made

446
00:32:03,752 --> 00:32:05,243
so I'll just finish this job and quit

447
00:32:05,729 --> 00:32:07,019
Oh, is that so?

448
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,164
Then...

449
00:32:10,137 --> 00:32:11,447
Let's leave after saying

450
00:32:11,448 --> 00:32:12,538
goodbye to the chairman

451
00:32:12,809 --> 00:32:14,309
- Okay
- Okay

452
00:32:15,585 --> 00:32:16,680
Sir

453
00:32:17,866 --> 00:32:19,622
congratulations on your inauguration

454
00:32:19,623 --> 00:32:20,788
Thank you

455
00:32:21,653 --> 00:32:23,669
Now I just have to start working hard

456
00:32:25,821 --> 00:32:28,305
This guy here is Dogeon Kim

457
00:32:28,306 --> 00:32:30,708
He's the top student in our province
for the mock exam

458
00:32:33,543 --> 00:32:35,822
Oh, we've met before, didn't we?

459
00:32:36,453 --> 00:32:38,901
That time at the barbecue restaurant

460
00:32:39,485 --> 00:32:41,476
Yes, that's him

461
00:32:42,406 --> 00:32:44,061
It's only right that someone like you

462
00:32:44,321 --> 00:32:45,995
who works hard gets the scholarship

463
00:32:46,787 --> 00:32:48,506
- Congratulations
- Thank you

464
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,437
What a diligent young man

465
00:32:51,668 --> 00:32:52,914
How do you maintain your grade

466
00:32:52,915 --> 00:32:54,446
while working part-time?

467
00:32:54,701 --> 00:32:56,608
If only Jeha worked

468
00:32:56,609 --> 00:32:59,057
half as hard as you, I would be relieved

469
00:32:59,424 --> 00:33:00,830
Mingook is as smart as his father,

470
00:33:00,831 --> 00:33:02,869
so I don't worry about him

471
00:33:04,353 --> 00:33:05,498
Jeha's a clever guy

472
00:33:05,738 --> 00:33:06,954
Once he gets interested in his studies,

473
00:33:06,955 --> 00:33:08,176
his grades will improve soon enough

474
00:33:09,277 --> 00:33:11,010
He seemed to have reflected a lot

475
00:33:11,011 --> 00:33:12,367
after receiving his midterm exam results

476
00:33:13,526 --> 00:33:14,862
Are the grades out?

477
00:33:15,087 --> 00:33:16,482
I heard
it's yet to be released for junior high

478
00:33:16,623 --> 00:33:17,663
Sorry?

479
00:33:19,351 --> 00:33:20,738
I mean...

480
00:33:21,343 --> 00:33:22,388
What?

481
00:33:22,597 --> 00:33:24,165
You didn't get his report card yet?

482
00:33:24,623 --> 00:33:25,681
Sorry?

483
00:33:26,397 --> 00:33:27,447
Ah...

484
00:33:31,203 --> 00:33:32,304
Dogeon

485
00:33:34,854 --> 00:33:35,936
Have you

486
00:33:39,186 --> 00:33:40,755
ever thought about giving tutoring?

487
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,802
I'm asking this for Jeha

488
00:33:43,399 --> 00:33:44,857
I...

489
00:33:46,906 --> 00:33:48,271
To get the scholarship,

490
00:33:48,588 --> 00:33:49,757
I can't take any part-time jobs

491
00:33:50,024 --> 00:33:52,242
I'll figure out a way

492
00:33:53,326 --> 00:33:54,813
Studying is one

493
00:33:54,814 --> 00:33:56,015
but I want Jeha

494
00:33:56,016 --> 00:33:57,111
to stay close to

495
00:33:57,112 --> 00:33:58,659
someone like you

496
00:33:59,502 --> 00:34:01,226
I don't like him

497
00:34:01,711 --> 00:34:03,234
hanging around with Cein Min

498
00:34:04,169 --> 00:34:05,314
But he's not

499
00:34:05,837 --> 00:34:07,079
a bad person

500
00:34:09,296 --> 00:34:11,020
Can you look after Jeha?

501
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,334
I'm not asking you to do this for free

502
00:34:15,824 --> 00:34:17,534
Yes, I'll try

503
00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:31,288
Are they out of their mind?

504
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:32,928
Why aren't they still here?

505
00:34:33,521 --> 00:34:34,721
Dogeon went to the Scholarship Foundation

506
00:34:34,723 --> 00:34:35,929
He says he's on his way

507
00:34:36,764 --> 00:34:38,364
- Is Jeha answering your message?
- No

508
00:34:39,094 --> 00:34:40,130
Shit

509
00:34:40,503 --> 00:34:41,686
I'll deal with him when he comes

510
00:34:41,687 --> 00:34:43,426
I'll give him a good spanking

511
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,971
Hey, guys!

512
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,400
Why are you so late?

513
00:34:48,299 --> 00:34:50,074
Sorry, it ended late

514
00:34:51,213 --> 00:34:52,254
Where's Jeha?

515
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:54,078
I don't know. I can't reach him

516
00:34:56,004 --> 00:34:58,661
Let's just go ourselves
once the bus arrives

517
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:00,199
We'll be late

518
00:35:13,962 --> 00:35:14,959
Here

519
00:35:15,693 --> 00:35:17,696
Mom, I'll use my phone just for a while

520
00:35:18,397 --> 00:35:19,451
No

521
00:35:19,452 --> 00:35:21,668
You hid your report card,
and I won't let it slide

522
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:23,377
I promised

523
00:35:23,378 --> 00:35:24,739
to do part-time together

524
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:26,315
Part-time?

525
00:35:27,064 --> 00:35:28,318
Why do you need the money?

526
00:35:28,319 --> 00:35:29,607
We give you the pocket money

527
00:35:30,751 --> 00:35:31,961
It's not that

528
00:35:32,894 --> 00:35:34,652
Can I just go out for a while?

529
00:35:34,901 --> 00:35:37,279
- Just for a while
- You still don't get it, do you?

530
00:35:38,023 --> 00:35:39,215
I told you

531
00:35:39,216 --> 00:35:40,947
you need to work harder than your brother

532
00:35:40,948 --> 00:35:42,922
to make your father look after you

533
00:35:43,066 --> 00:35:44,329
You need to show some effort

534
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:45,906
- to make your father...
- I get it

535
00:35:47,267 --> 00:35:49,044
I'll work really hard from now on

536
00:35:49,427 --> 00:35:50,876
Let me just go out for today

537
00:35:50,877 --> 00:35:51,865
No

538
00:35:51,866 --> 00:35:53,425
I really mean it this time

539
00:35:54,084 --> 00:35:55,425
You're grounded for the weekend

540
00:35:55,868 --> 00:35:57,887
Mom, I really can't for this week

541
00:35:58,543 --> 00:35:59,665
Just this once

542
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:01,914
I'll really work hard from now on

543
00:36:01,915 --> 00:36:03,578
I mean it

544
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,395
Sit down and study

545
00:36:06,396 --> 00:36:07,982
Mingook's home?

546
00:36:15,469 --> 00:36:16,578
Aren't you hungry?

547
00:36:39,456 --> 00:36:40,525
Let's go

548
00:36:48,655 --> 00:36:50,566
Feels like my vertebrae's leaving my body

549
00:36:52,378 --> 00:36:54,382
What's up with Jeha Jeon?

550
00:36:55,457 --> 00:36:58,073
I should've kept my mouth shut

551
00:36:59,215 --> 00:37:01,249
What? What is it?

552
00:37:01,726 --> 00:37:02,930
Never mind

553
00:37:03,657 --> 00:37:04,793
But how long

554
00:37:04,794 --> 00:37:05,960
should we carry on with this?

555
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,630
I'm sorry

556
00:37:09,788 --> 00:37:11,788
Dogeon!

557
00:37:12,325 --> 00:37:14,580
Say sorry to my vertebrae!

558
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:16,144
Here?

559
00:37:16,316 --> 00:37:17,477
Below

560
00:37:23,704 --> 00:37:24,948
This crybaby

561
00:37:24,949 --> 00:37:25,985
I mean it

562
00:37:27,032 --> 00:37:28,769
- Does it hurt a lot?
- Crybaby!

563
00:37:32,246 --> 00:37:33,439
Be gentle

564
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,170
They could've given us right after the work

565
00:37:35,171 --> 00:37:36,296
Why are they asking us to come back?

566
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:38,356
I think that boss isn't stealing

567
00:37:38,357 --> 00:37:39,542
our wage

568
00:37:40,518 --> 00:37:41,553
No way

569
00:37:41,886 --> 00:37:44,255
Let's buy the gift

570
00:37:44,256 --> 00:37:45,495
after we get the wage

571
00:37:46,033 --> 00:37:48,012
Haru said he'll prepare

572
00:37:48,013 --> 00:37:49,152
the cake and the party

573
00:37:50,741 --> 00:37:51,803
How about you?

574
00:37:52,538 --> 00:37:53,852
Do you think I'll succeed?

575
00:37:54,322 --> 00:37:55,498
Hwan

576
00:37:56,034 --> 00:37:58,308
Cein might doubt
all the people in the world,

577
00:37:58,455 --> 00:37:59,865
but he won't doubt you

578
00:38:00,081 --> 00:38:01,168
I promise

579
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:06,890
What's this?

580
00:38:06,891 --> 00:38:08,318
It's your birthday today

581
00:38:09,206 --> 00:38:10,239
How do you know?

582
00:38:10,965 --> 00:38:11,976
Because through us,

583
00:38:11,977 --> 00:38:13,277
you're re-born

584
00:38:13,278 --> 00:38:14,604
as the child of the God

585
00:38:22,352 --> 00:38:23,549
Happy birthday

586
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:25,859
You're re-born as the child of the God

587
00:38:26,349 --> 00:38:27,516
I need to run errands for my mom

588
00:38:27,517 --> 00:38:29,394
Your God is over there to meet you

589
00:38:29,395 --> 00:38:30,574
Let's go over there

590
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:40,082
Am I too early?

591
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:47,050
I heard you're good at fighting

592
00:38:48,301 --> 00:38:49,533
Follow me to the dry container

593
00:38:52,916 --> 00:38:53,990
I heard

594
00:38:54,518 --> 00:38:55,890
you're good at fighting

595
00:38:57,048 --> 00:38:58,113
Want to follow me to the dry container?

596
00:38:59,066 --> 00:39:00,241
- Hwan
- What!

597
00:39:01,509 --> 00:39:02,552
What are you doing?

598
00:39:03,266 --> 00:39:04,602
Nothing, it's nothing

599
00:39:06,579 --> 00:39:07,815
What are you doing here?

600
00:39:10,885 --> 00:39:12,737
It's my house

601
00:39:13,397 --> 00:39:14,510
Oh, right

602
00:39:14,736 --> 00:39:15,912
It's your house

603
00:39:17,293 --> 00:39:18,386
Have a nice day

604
00:39:21,627 --> 00:39:23,398
I heard you're good at dry container

605
00:39:23,399 --> 00:39:24,428
Follow me to the fighting

606
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:28,688
- What?
- What?

607
00:39:32,209 --> 00:39:34,154
I, I meant

608
00:39:37,997 --> 00:39:39,423
Can I talk to you for a while?

609
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:42,943
Yes

610
00:39:44,471 --> 00:39:45,525
Now?

611
00:39:46,392 --> 00:39:47,845
It could get lengthy

612
00:39:51,025 --> 00:39:52,933
Hamburger! Do you like hamburger?

613
00:39:54,563 --> 00:39:56,585
- Yeah
- Let's go eat hamburger

614
00:40:01,293 --> 00:40:02,360
Where can we get some hamburgers?

615
00:40:05,754 --> 00:40:06,946
That, um...

616
00:40:06,947 --> 00:40:08,840
- Yeah, I'll follow you
- Okay

617
00:40:28,637 --> 00:40:30,251
Didn't know
you dissolve burger in your mouth

618
00:40:31,384 --> 00:40:32,373
What?

619
00:40:41,518 --> 00:40:42,608
I

620
00:40:42,609 --> 00:40:44,287
have a lot in my mouth right now

621
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:46,272
- Can I talk after I finish this?
- Yes

622
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:49,889
Take your time

623
00:40:51,624 --> 00:40:52,692
We finished the work

624
00:40:52,693 --> 00:40:54,569
Why aren't you paying us?

625
00:40:54,975 --> 00:40:56,585
Who said I won't pay you?

626
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:57,832
Come back tomorrow

627
00:40:58,775 --> 00:40:59,821
You should've paid us

628
00:40:59,822 --> 00:41:01,091
after the work ended

629
00:41:01,452 --> 00:41:02,857
In the afternoon, you said you'll pay us

630
00:41:02,858 --> 00:41:04,516
That's why we came back

631
00:41:04,517 --> 00:41:05,786
You also said there will be four of you

632
00:41:05,787 --> 00:41:07,480
but only three of you came

633
00:41:07,481 --> 00:41:09,174
We did four people's worth

634
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:11,319
- because you kept scolding us!
- What?

635
00:41:11,668 --> 00:41:13,075
I gave you the job

636
00:41:13,215 --> 00:41:14,776
because you begged for it

637
00:41:15,175 --> 00:41:16,410
Considering how you worked,

638
00:41:16,411 --> 00:41:17,639
you should only get half of the wage!

639
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,205
That's ridiculous!

640
00:41:19,206 --> 00:41:20,349
Why do you swear?

641
00:41:20,742 --> 00:41:21,767
Sir

642
00:41:21,998 --> 00:41:23,868
We really need that money

643
00:41:24,277 --> 00:41:25,433
We need to get that money today

644
00:41:26,576 --> 00:41:27,939
I'll report him if he doesn't

645
00:41:28,271 --> 00:41:29,675
Report?

646
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:31,001
These young pricks

647
00:41:31,002 --> 00:41:32,505
Already full of rubbish

648
00:41:32,893 --> 00:41:35,238
You do know it's illegal

649
00:41:35,239 --> 00:41:36,354
for minors to work late at night

650
00:41:37,183 --> 00:41:38,295
Leave when I'm still nice to you

651
00:41:38,367 --> 00:41:39,489
Dare come back again

652
00:41:41,174 --> 00:41:42,565
You knew that, but you still hired us

653
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:44,907
Let's just lie down here

654
00:41:47,757 --> 00:41:48,740
Huh?

655
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:50,295
What do you think you're doing?

656
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:52,087
We aren't leaving until you pay us

657
00:41:52,088 --> 00:41:53,051
Right, Hosu?

658
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:54,607
Right! We can't! We won't!

659
00:41:57,809 --> 00:41:58,900
Did you get the money?

660
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:02,612
What the

661
00:42:04,635 --> 00:42:06,700
Are we having the party today or what?

662
00:42:17,625 --> 00:42:18,963
Save me

663
00:42:19,325 --> 00:42:20,685
How long should I carry on with this?

664
00:42:22,659 --> 00:42:23,750
What am I doing here?

665
00:42:25,562 --> 00:42:26,586
Ah

666
00:42:30,437 --> 00:42:31,831
Do you like jajangmyeon?

667
00:42:32,013 --> 00:42:33,092
I said I'm not eating

668
00:42:34,997 --> 00:42:36,257
We had hamburger, hot dog

669
00:42:36,258 --> 00:42:37,273
and even ice cream

670
00:42:37,274 --> 00:42:38,395
I can't eat any more

671
00:42:39,591 --> 00:42:41,602
Just in case you're hungry

672
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:47,114
What do you mean 'hungry?'

673
00:42:48,721 --> 00:42:49,696
Hwan

674
00:42:50,153 --> 00:42:51,968
If you have no other things to say,
I'll just go

675
00:42:53,495 --> 00:42:54,566
No

676
00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:56,151
I have something to tell you

677
00:42:58,023 --> 00:42:59,091
What is it?

678
00:43:01,405 --> 00:43:02,454
It's getting dark

679
00:43:04,037 --> 00:43:06,824
I thought of telling you after sunset

680
00:43:08,264 --> 00:43:11,174
The sunset is so pretty, Cein

681
00:43:15,007 --> 00:43:16,012
Lately

682
00:43:17,391 --> 00:43:18,584
the world is so beautiful to me

683
00:43:20,901 --> 00:43:22,394
What is he saying?

684
00:43:27,126 --> 00:43:28,149
Wait

685
00:43:31,313 --> 00:43:32,533
Please buy us more time

686
00:43:32,534 --> 00:43:33,789
One hour more, sorry

687
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:41,928
Ah, this is tough

688
00:43:43,019 --> 00:43:44,386
This is really tough

689
00:43:45,047 --> 00:43:46,548
What am I doing this alone?

690
00:43:47,233 --> 00:43:48,279
What's so tough?

691
00:43:51,286 --> 00:43:52,919
Can't tell you. It's all because of you

692
00:43:53,753 --> 00:43:54,792
Because of me?

693
00:43:55,188 --> 00:43:56,250
Only if

694
00:43:56,867 --> 00:43:58,686
I could tell you honestly,

695
00:44:00,496 --> 00:44:02,252
it wouldn't be this hard

696
00:44:05,283 --> 00:44:06,303
But I can't

697
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:09,804
I shouldn't

698
00:44:33,954 --> 00:44:35,031
Hwan

699
00:44:37,404 --> 00:44:38,420
Do...

700
00:44:39,515 --> 00:44:40,605
you like me?

701
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:42,500
What?

702
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,286
Shoot

703
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:11,301
Is he nuts?

704
00:45:12,303 --> 00:45:14,013
It's already past six

705
00:45:14,014 --> 00:45:16,223
The earphone store closes at nine

706
00:45:16,569 --> 00:45:17,644
It's past six?

707
00:45:21,259 --> 00:45:22,269
Guys

708
00:45:22,988 --> 00:45:24,358
You don't think he will pay us, right?

709
00:45:25,294 --> 00:45:26,389
I'm sorry

710
00:45:27,127 --> 00:45:28,487
I'm the one who suggested this

711
00:45:28,618 --> 00:45:30,106
Why are you apologizing?

712
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:32,323
The bad guy here is that boss bastard!

713
00:45:32,372 --> 00:45:33,382
What did you say?

714
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:35,046
These pricks

715
00:45:38,626 --> 00:45:39,663
Hey

716
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:41,839
Take it

717
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:42,868
or leave it

718
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:45,054
I gave you the job
because you needed the money

719
00:45:45,426 --> 00:45:46,563
and you call me boss bastard?

720
00:45:47,011 --> 00:45:48,568
You guys got some attitude

721
00:45:48,726 --> 00:45:49,756
Fine

722
00:45:52,094 --> 00:45:53,421
We did our work, so we'll take it

723
00:45:53,955 --> 00:45:54,968
Let's go

724
00:45:56,504 --> 00:45:58,796
We need to check it before we leave

725
00:45:58,797 --> 00:45:59,807
Right

726
00:46:08,804 --> 00:46:11,095
It's all in 10 won

727
00:46:12,504 --> 00:46:14,148
You're a true adult

728
00:46:15,028 --> 00:46:18,091
If it's short of a single won

729
00:46:18,092 --> 00:46:19,331
I'm lying down again

730
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:20,820
Hey, pile it up in 100s

731
00:46:21,432 --> 00:46:23,163
Look at these pricks

732
00:46:33,298 --> 00:46:34,319
No

733
00:46:35,273 --> 00:46:37,097
- You're misunderstanding
- Talk

734
00:46:38,161 --> 00:46:39,502
Talk from there

735
00:46:41,664 --> 00:46:42,690
Well, I...

736
00:46:43,849 --> 00:46:46,117
I respect your taste

737
00:46:46,561 --> 00:46:48,392
- but I like women
- Hey

738
00:46:49,075 --> 00:46:50,953
I like women, too

739
00:46:52,807 --> 00:46:54,773
I don't just like them, I love them

740
00:46:55,146 --> 00:46:56,171
I love them very much

741
00:46:56,592 --> 00:46:57,741
What? He's confessing?

742
00:46:57,827 --> 00:46:59,230
He must be really in love

743
00:46:59,231 --> 00:47:00,426
No, no, I'm not

744
00:47:00,427 --> 00:47:01,398
I'll root for you

745
00:47:01,399 --> 00:47:03,435
- No, I'm not that type of person!
- It's okay

746
00:47:03,436 --> 00:47:05,114
It's not okay!

747
00:47:06,223 --> 00:47:07,912
It's freaking embarrassing!

748
00:47:09,685 --> 00:47:11,617
What are we doing here?

749
00:47:12,752 --> 00:47:14,279
I was already having a bad day

750
00:47:15,073 --> 00:47:16,121
I'm sorry

751
00:47:18,078 --> 00:47:19,115
I'm sorry

752
00:47:20,643 --> 00:47:22,899
If you have something to say, say it

753
00:47:25,579 --> 00:47:26,613
You aren't here

754
00:47:27,208 --> 00:47:28,330
to talk about your mom

755
00:47:29,818 --> 00:47:30,937
are you?

756
00:47:32,217 --> 00:47:33,190
Huh?

757
00:47:34,102 --> 00:47:35,108
My mom

758
00:47:35,751 --> 00:47:36,832
What about her?

759
00:47:37,655 --> 00:47:39,125
When I brought you the bike

760
00:47:39,126 --> 00:47:40,494
I took a look at your camcorder

761
00:47:41,603 --> 00:47:42,776
The one in the video

762
00:47:43,729 --> 00:47:44,765
is your mom, right?

763
00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:49,116
I'm sorry
if I touched on something sensitive

764
00:47:49,268 --> 00:47:50,292
No

765
00:47:51,818 --> 00:47:53,072
That is my mom

766
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:55,079
But

767
00:47:56,175 --> 00:47:58,482
I'm not here to talk about that

768
00:48:00,388 --> 00:48:01,461
Then what?

769
00:48:03,262 --> 00:48:04,731
I'm only left with one option

770
00:48:09,191 --> 00:48:10,211
Huh?

771
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:11,588
Something is falling

772
00:48:12,615 --> 00:48:13,968
I'm sorry! I'm really sorry!

773
00:48:14,426 --> 00:48:15,763
- Wow
- I'm really sorry

774
00:48:16,014 --> 00:48:17,646
Hwan, bring it back!

775
00:48:18,241 --> 00:48:19,312
Hwan!

776
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:21,466
I said bring it back! Are you mad?

777
00:48:38,732 --> 00:48:39,873
Where are you going?

778
00:48:41,422 --> 00:48:42,908
Didn't you hear that you're grounded?

779
00:48:44,308 --> 00:48:45,851
It's Cein's birthday

780
00:48:45,958 --> 00:48:46,970
So?

781
00:48:47,206 --> 00:48:49,011
It's his birthday, so?

782
00:48:49,749 --> 00:48:51,043
I told you

783
00:48:51,044 --> 00:48:52,405
I don't like you hanging out with him

784
00:48:53,071 --> 00:48:55,187
- Don't you know what he's like?
- Cein isn't like that

785
00:48:56,008 --> 00:48:59,026
- He didn't do it
- How do you know?

786
00:49:00,679 --> 00:49:02,733
You're getting into more mess

787
00:49:02,734 --> 00:49:03,871
after you started your junior high school

788
00:49:04,390 --> 00:49:05,486
You don't study

789
00:49:05,487 --> 00:49:06,579
You don't behave

790
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:07,781
to your father's liking

791
00:49:08,688 --> 00:49:10,497
What's your plan?

792
00:49:10,975 --> 00:49:12,082
Can't you see that I'm trying

793
00:49:12,083 --> 00:49:13,664
my best in this house?

794
00:49:14,202 --> 00:49:16,213
You think I enjoy doing this?

795
00:49:16,331 --> 00:49:17,925
Don't you even feel sorry for mom?

796
00:49:17,926 --> 00:49:19,750
I'm doing this because of you!

797
00:49:20,884 --> 00:49:22,092
Did I ask you to do all this?

798
00:49:23,206 --> 00:49:24,741
This house, these clothes

799
00:49:24,742 --> 00:49:26,375
The one who can't live without them

800
00:49:26,376 --> 00:49:28,016
is you, not me!

801
00:49:33,975 --> 00:49:35,083
Jeha

802
00:49:36,335 --> 00:49:37,496
I'm sorry

803
00:49:38,210 --> 00:49:39,339
I apologize

804
00:49:46,555 --> 00:49:47,583
You're right

805
00:49:49,136 --> 00:49:50,291
I do pity you

806
00:49:55,654 --> 00:49:56,943
but I pity myself, too

807
00:50:03,948 --> 00:50:05,008
Jeha

808
00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:24,462
Don't come

809
00:50:26,177 --> 00:50:29,318
Don't come

810
00:50:32,673 --> 00:50:33,675
Hwan

811
00:50:34,569 --> 00:50:36,119
I played soccer when I was little

812
00:50:36,585 --> 00:50:38,188
I can catch up with you if I want to

813
00:50:39,077 --> 00:50:40,807
- Give it back when I say it nicely
- Don't come

814
00:50:41,693 --> 00:50:42,672
Don't come

815
00:50:42,824 --> 00:50:44,186
- What?
- No

816
00:50:44,604 --> 00:50:45,643
You can't take it

817
00:50:46,417 --> 00:50:47,665
I told them I won't do it

818
00:50:56,175 --> 00:50:57,210
We're ready

819
00:50:57,990 --> 00:50:58,982
It's done

820
00:50:59,789 --> 00:51:00,850
It's done

821
00:51:01,955 --> 00:51:03,005
Sorry?

822
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:05,896
No, come

823
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,231
Come here

824
00:51:07,474 --> 00:51:08,512
- Hwan
- Hey

825
00:51:09,031 --> 00:51:10,561
- Come here
- What is it?

826
00:51:11,466 --> 00:51:12,767
- Are you crazy? Huh?
- Come here

827
00:51:19,412 --> 00:51:20,510
We're almost there

828
00:51:24,061 --> 00:51:25,606
Why isn't he coming? Oh, he's coming

829
00:51:28,532 --> 00:51:29,551
Here

830
00:51:29,552 --> 00:51:31,860
Are you insane? Uh?

831
00:51:32,397 --> 00:51:34,077
Hwan, I'm on the brink of swearing

832
00:51:34,376 --> 00:51:35,534
I said I'm going to swear at you!

833
00:51:36,602 --> 00:51:38,569
If you just come inside

834
00:51:38,753 --> 00:51:40,116
I'll give your phone back

835
00:51:40,878 --> 00:51:42,561
I really have something to say

836
00:51:43,142 --> 00:51:44,164
Come inside for a while

837
00:51:53,126 --> 00:51:54,115
Why

838
00:51:55,095 --> 00:51:56,943
Why are you entering that dark place?

839
00:51:59,295 --> 00:52:00,402
What are you trying to do?

840
00:52:10,167 --> 00:52:11,204
Hwan

841
00:52:11,771 --> 00:52:12,836
Hwan

842
00:52:13,516 --> 00:52:14,591
Come here

843
00:52:16,856 --> 00:52:17,991
Just a little more

844
00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:22,310
- What's all this?
- Come a little more

845
00:52:22,424 --> 00:52:24,099
Why should I listen to you?

846
00:52:24,582 --> 00:52:25,728
Give my phone back!

847
00:52:26,762 --> 00:52:28,007
Give my phone back!

848
00:52:28,008 --> 00:52:29,088
Give it quickly!

849
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:39,873
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you

850
00:52:39,874 --> 00:52:42,748
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you

851
00:52:42,939 --> 00:52:46,238
- Happy birthday to Cein
- Happy birthday to Cein

852
00:52:46,602 --> 00:52:49,040
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you

853
00:52:50,526 --> 00:52:52,362
- Quickly
- Blow it!

854
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:55,499
Quickly! My hand!

855
00:53:05,509 --> 00:53:07,861
- That Dolk
- That Dolk

856
00:53:08,590 --> 00:53:09,926
What the

857
00:53:15,908 --> 00:53:16,926
It's okay

858
00:53:18,022 --> 00:53:19,112
- How...
- What are we going to do?

859
00:53:19,113 --> 00:53:20,348
Guys, guys

860
00:53:20,349 --> 00:53:21,723
- It's dirty
- Don't eat that

861
00:53:21,724 --> 00:53:24,031
- How will we eat it?
- He was going to eat that

862
00:53:24,032 --> 00:53:25,071
It's okay

863
00:53:30,044 --> 00:53:31,733
Wait

864
00:53:32,407 --> 00:53:33,409
Wait!

865
00:53:36,646 --> 00:53:37,823
- Are you okay? I'm sorry
- Are you okay?

866
00:53:38,488 --> 00:53:41,912
Sorry for what?

867
00:54:04,402 --> 00:54:06,413
That's why you acted weird

868
00:54:06,999 --> 00:54:08,264
I thought he ate

869
00:54:08,265 --> 00:54:09,429
something wrong

870
00:54:10,665 --> 00:54:12,020
I almost died

871
00:54:13,537 --> 00:54:14,545
Hold on

872
00:54:21,309 --> 00:54:22,313
Hold on

873
00:54:23,564 --> 00:54:24,555
Hwan

874
00:54:25,259 --> 00:54:26,385
You do like women, right?

875
00:54:27,688 --> 00:54:29,252
I said I like them. Stop it now

876
00:54:30,452 --> 00:54:31,619
Now the present

877
00:54:31,805 --> 00:54:33,121
The highlight of the birthday party

878
00:54:33,122 --> 00:54:34,820
There will be the gift giving ceremony

879
00:54:34,821 --> 00:54:35,920
Applause!

880
00:54:38,863 --> 00:54:40,321
If we were a little more late,

881
00:54:40,322 --> 00:54:42,168
we almost couldn't make it

882
00:54:43,239 --> 00:54:44,891
Cein, happy birthday

883
00:54:45,702 --> 00:54:47,073
We saved all we had and got this for you

884
00:54:47,954 --> 00:54:49,639
It's making my spine hurt again

885
00:54:52,775 --> 00:54:53,803
Are you sure it's a present?

886
00:54:54,171 --> 00:54:55,279
Isn't it a brick?

887
00:54:58,285 --> 00:54:59,444
It's a brick!

888
00:55:00,676 --> 00:55:01,780
Open it

889
00:55:07,857 --> 00:55:08,863
Uh?

890
00:55:11,505 --> 00:55:12,576
This is expensive

891
00:55:14,747 --> 00:55:15,988
How did you? Huh?

892
00:55:15,989 --> 00:55:17,087
Do you like it?

893
00:55:18,533 --> 00:55:19,933
Well, it's a gift

894
00:55:20,847 --> 00:55:21,942
Thanks

895
00:55:24,702 --> 00:55:25,857
Then this is mine now

896
00:55:27,765 --> 00:55:28,829
How did you

897
00:55:28,830 --> 00:55:29,934
listen to music with this?

898
00:55:31,402 --> 00:55:32,422
Does this even work?

899
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:35,895
How do I install this?

900
00:55:36,071 --> 00:55:37,142
I'll install it for you

901
00:55:38,748 --> 00:55:39,796
Hwan, be careful

902
00:55:39,878 --> 00:55:40,973
This is expensive

903
00:55:41,953 --> 00:55:42,990
Wait

904
00:55:43,455 --> 00:55:44,657
The left part isn't even working

905
00:55:45,099 --> 00:55:46,126
It's not working at all

906
00:55:46,457 --> 00:55:48,149
What? It is working. Give it back

907
00:55:48,150 --> 00:55:49,659
You take it away after you give it to me

908
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:50,856
Mine

909
00:55:50,857 --> 00:55:51,910
Spit

910
00:56:15,323 --> 00:56:16,355
Haru

911
00:56:17,158 --> 00:56:18,346
Don't you have to go home?

912
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:19,625
I'll be fine

913
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:21,125
I already told her

914
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:26,378
Let's celebrate the next birthday as well

915
00:56:27,230 --> 00:56:28,288
Who's birthday is next?

916
00:56:28,289 --> 00:56:29,410
Me!

917
00:56:29,563 --> 00:56:30,923
Mine's on September

918
00:56:31,230 --> 00:56:32,307
When is Hosu's birthday?

919
00:56:32,308 --> 00:56:33,315
Me?

920
00:56:35,048 --> 00:56:36,103
Mine is...

921
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:37,757
I don't know exactly

922
00:56:39,392 --> 00:56:40,452
I think I was abandoned

923
00:56:40,453 --> 00:56:42,134
around my birthday

924
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:52,671
Let's just pretend I celebrated

925
00:56:52,672 --> 00:56:54,738
my birthday on your birthdays

926
00:56:55,358 --> 00:56:56,645
Even today

927
00:56:59,711 --> 00:57:00,759
Hey

928
00:57:01,619 --> 00:57:02,760
Why are you free-riding

929
00:57:02,761 --> 00:57:04,379
on my birthday?

930
00:57:05,613 --> 00:57:07,292
Oh, yes. I crossed the line

931
00:57:14,068 --> 00:57:15,511
It's past 12

932
00:57:16,121 --> 00:57:17,359
so it's Hosu's birthday now!

933
00:57:20,773 --> 00:57:21,856
What?

934
00:57:23,015 --> 00:57:25,254
- Hey
- It's Hosu's birthday today, so?

935
00:57:27,333 --> 00:57:29,338
Happy birthday to you

936
00:57:29,339 --> 00:57:31,720
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you

937
00:57:32,073 --> 00:57:33,194
Catch him!

938
00:57:33,195 --> 00:57:34,302
Catch him

939
00:57:40,591 --> 00:57:42,207
Happy birthday to you

940
00:58:32,397 --> 00:58:33,470
Jeha, what are you doing?

941
00:58:33,762 --> 00:58:34,839
Shh

942
00:58:35,188 --> 00:58:36,264
Fingernail

943
00:58:37,146 --> 00:58:38,871
Cein always bites his fingernails

944
00:58:44,683 --> 00:58:45,749
If you do that,

945
00:58:46,077 --> 00:58:47,091
he doesn't bite?

946
00:58:48,101 --> 00:58:49,200
That's what I was told

947
00:58:50,002 --> 00:58:51,065
No?

948
00:59:04,921 --> 00:59:08,384
11 MISSED CALLS FROM MR. SONG

949
00:59:08,996 --> 00:59:10,696
Jeha, I'll leave first

950
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:12,944
I'll just finish this and go

951
00:59:17,022 --> 00:59:18,436
Don't go

952
01:01:06,405 --> 01:01:07,873
What are you up to these days?

953
01:01:12,948 --> 01:01:14,169
Friend

954
01:01:16,484 --> 01:01:17,813
Are you making such a thing?

955
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:22,748
I told you several times

956
01:01:27,790 --> 01:01:29,800
Friends are unnecessary in your life

957
01:05:36,082 --> 01:05:37,155
It's my son's birthday

958
01:05:40,293 --> 01:05:41,809
Thank you for coming to mommy

959
01:06:35,902 --> 01:06:37,606
It's a holiday today.
What are you doing in school?

960
01:06:39,967 --> 01:06:41,717
I'm sure the door was closed

961
01:06:42,359 --> 01:06:43,534
How did you come in?

962
01:06:48,124 --> 01:06:50,638
You make me think of

963
01:06:51,748 --> 01:06:52,951
several things

964
01:06:57,355 --> 01:06:58,393
You know my mom, right?
