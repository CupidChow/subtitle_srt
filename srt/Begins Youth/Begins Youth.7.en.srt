This series is based on a fictionalized story inspired by the story of BTS's album,
The Most Beautiful Moment in Life,
and is not related to BTS members and their families.

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,300
Child actors and animals were filmed
in safe conditions under the supervision of their guardians.

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:10,844
Hello, this is 911

4
00:00:10,845 --> 00:00:12,021
How can I help you?

5
00:00:15,412 --> 00:00:16,528
There's a fire

6
00:00:19,213 --> 00:00:20,915
Where is your location?

7
00:00:22,614 --> 00:00:24,145
Are you calling from a payphone?

8
00:00:25,204 --> 00:00:26,247
Yes

9
00:00:27,012 --> 00:00:28,290
Where is the fire?

10
00:00:28,972 --> 00:00:30,115
Is it nearby?

11
00:00:31,035 --> 00:00:33,020
What's the current
situation of the fire?

12
00:00:36,672 --> 00:00:37,772
- Well, it's...
- Hello?

13
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,200
Hello?

14
00:00:54,151 --> 00:00:55,881
It seems like it's
going to catch fire soon

15
00:00:56,778 --> 00:00:57,898
What?

16
00:00:59,019 --> 00:01:01,562
You think it's going to catch fire? Hello?

17
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:05,245
That piano academy...

18
00:01:07,153 --> 00:01:08,339
Hello!

19
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:11,374
Hello?

20
00:01:51,023 --> 00:01:52,282
I brought your long johns

21
00:01:52,283 --> 00:01:53,748
It's still chilly

22
00:01:54,705 --> 00:01:55,954
I told you it's okay

23
00:01:56,535 --> 00:01:57,695
I have a heating mat

24
00:01:58,787 --> 00:02:00,737
Oh dear, see, you're coughing

25
00:02:01,145 --> 00:02:02,791
Put these on, right now

26
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:10,456
I heard the bicycle shop is moving too

27
00:02:11,615 --> 00:02:14,564
Last month, Minsu's family
put their house up for sale...

28
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:21,165
Everyone moving around
makes me feel uneasy

29
00:02:25,258 --> 00:02:26,448
You know...

30
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:30,131
Since your friend's father got elected

31
00:02:30,787 --> 00:02:32,087
they probably won't...

32
00:02:33,544 --> 00:02:34,747
go through the redevelopment, right?

33
00:02:35,425 --> 00:02:36,769
His campaign promise was

34
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:38,979
to invalidate the redevelopment

35
00:02:40,087 --> 00:02:41,543
I can't trust politicians

36
00:02:44,438 --> 00:02:45,605
Dogeon

37
00:02:47,017 --> 00:02:50,039
If that father could
use his influence a bit

38
00:02:50,376 --> 00:02:53,394
maybe your father could still
receive work injury compensation?

39
00:02:53,843 --> 00:02:55,983
But you just said you
couldn't trust politicians

40
00:02:59,364 --> 00:03:00,395
Mom

41
00:03:01,255 --> 00:03:03,162
Please don't hope for that

42
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:06,809
I know it's embarrassing and awkward

43
00:03:08,136 --> 00:03:09,314
I understand

44
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:17,995
Changjun Kim, Elected legislator of Songju
I promise I'll make Songju towards the light!

45
00:03:36,403 --> 00:03:37,506
Why?

46
00:03:40,116 --> 00:03:42,113
Are you going to say
that man is your friend again?

47
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:47,598
I really wish he was your friend

48
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:53,696
Let's go, I'm hungry

49
00:04:04,787 --> 00:04:05,921
Enjoy your meal

50
00:04:06,844 --> 00:04:07,913
Thank you

51
00:04:20,165 --> 00:04:21,882
Ah, come on, eat it

52
00:04:23,886 --> 00:04:26,429
You didn't even finish
the roll of gimbap I bought yesterday

53
00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:34,409
Try it

54
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,599
I saw you going out with Dad

55
00:04:53,197 --> 00:04:55,386
- One bottle of soju, please
- Yes

56
00:04:56,907 --> 00:04:57,922
Really!

57
00:04:59,635 --> 00:05:00,739
You're not going to drink it

58
00:05:03,554 --> 00:05:04,855
Here it is

59
00:05:07,329 --> 00:05:08,871
You're not going to pick it up!

60
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,285
If you drink it,

61
00:05:25,705 --> 00:05:26,895
I'll forget

62
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,331
all the good memories with you

63
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,558
If you drink that!

64
00:05:44,737 --> 00:05:46,276
the Dad who used to play catch with me

65
00:05:47,059 --> 00:05:48,079
will be gone

66
00:05:51,072 --> 00:05:52,262
I'll throw away the ball

67
00:05:54,641 --> 00:05:55,663
and everything

68
00:06:32,182 --> 00:06:34,142
Eat it, slowly

69
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:41,809
What? I can't hear you well

70
00:06:47,766 --> 00:06:49,665
Eat before it gets cold

71
00:07:03,747 --> 00:07:04,930
Dad...

72
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,689
Do you still have no plans

73
00:07:11,051 --> 00:07:12,070
to live together again with the family?

74
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:18,944
Do you still...

75
00:07:19,851 --> 00:07:20,918
hate...

76
00:07:22,046 --> 00:07:23,113
Mom?

77
00:07:43,268 --> 00:07:49,205
Chuncheon Gospel Church

78
00:07:52,776 --> 00:07:54,964
- Oh, hello
- Hello

79
00:07:55,949 --> 00:07:57,160
Oh, Haru

80
00:07:57,161 --> 00:07:59,605
You graduated from
middle school this year, right?

81
00:08:00,472 --> 00:08:03,156
How are you doing after the heart surgery?

82
00:08:03,535 --> 00:08:05,421
- Are you okay?
- Me?

83
00:08:06,976 --> 00:08:08,318
Heart surgery?

84
00:08:08,998 --> 00:08:10,629
Oh, that...

85
00:08:11,517 --> 00:08:13,428
During last summer break...

86
00:08:14,318 --> 00:08:19,477
Oh right, Haru, remember
when you were hospitalized

87
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:24,272
He's gotten much better,
all thanks to the pastor's prayers

88
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:27,014
- That's very good to hear
- Yes

89
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:30,584
So, Haru, how about
joining the Bible study

90
00:08:30,585 --> 00:08:33,985
and going to the summer
Bible camp with us?

91
00:08:36,036 --> 00:08:38,534
I don't think my parents would allow it

92
00:08:39,836 --> 00:08:42,146
They don't seem ready
for it yet, both of them

93
00:08:43,635 --> 00:08:45,059
I'm all ready though

94
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,054
- Let's go, we'll be going now
- Okay

95
00:08:51,055 --> 00:08:52,714
Peace be with you

96
00:09:02,329 --> 00:09:04,569
Haru, why did you do that earlier?

97
00:09:05,758 --> 00:09:06,777
What do you mean?

98
00:09:07,864 --> 00:09:10,618
You did that on purpose
to embarrass Mom and Dad

99
00:09:11,335 --> 00:09:12,618
I've said this many times

100
00:09:13,198 --> 00:09:15,624
we're trying to make sure
you don't get hurt...

101
00:09:20,772 --> 00:09:25,459
Haru, can you stop texting
when your dad is talking to you?

102
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:27,677
Who is it?

103
00:09:29,949 --> 00:09:31,074
A friend

104
00:09:32,841 --> 00:09:33,886
A friend?

105
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,973
That friend?

106
00:09:38,481 --> 00:09:39,643
Yes

107
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,263
Haru, shall we have dinner?

108
00:09:53,011 --> 00:09:55,423
Oh, I'm going to eat with my friend

109
00:10:01,553 --> 00:10:02,745
Which friend?

110
00:10:04,868 --> 00:10:06,010
That friend

111
00:10:07,636 --> 00:10:08,898
I'll be back

112
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,530
Right

113
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,179
Just like you said, Dad and Mom
need to feel what it's like

114
00:10:25,627 --> 00:10:28,277
How hard it is to hide something

115
00:10:31,606 --> 00:10:33,807
But without you,
I couldn't have done this

116
00:10:36,477 --> 00:10:39,299
Yeah, it's not my fault

117
00:10:40,628 --> 00:10:43,553
Just like it's not my fault
for being this way

118
00:10:46,035 --> 00:10:47,170
Where are you now?

119
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,723
Almost there?

120
00:11:06,448 --> 00:11:07,713
What?

121
00:11:08,737 --> 00:11:10,495
Why did he go to the bus
terminal at this time of night?

122
00:11:13,647 --> 00:11:15,612
Why is he keeping secrets these days?

123
00:11:16,974 --> 00:11:17,998
It's hurtful

124
00:11:26,511 --> 00:11:28,039
This is the boarding announcement

125
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:33,527
The express bus to Seoul
will depart in a few minutes

126
00:11:34,056 --> 00:11:39,499
If you are boarding,
please proceed to the gate to board

127
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:33,033
Wonjoong Byeon, Death, Key No.8

128
00:12:33,034 --> 00:12:36,267
Issue with the 7th members, sexual assault
It's embarrassing to even mention,

129
00:12:37,113 --> 00:12:42,744
but making a false accusation of sexual
assault against Changjun Kim...

130
00:12:44,773 --> 00:12:47,544
Eunjoo is not that kind of person

131
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:57,637
Changjun Kim

132
00:12:59,104 --> 00:13:05,475
There's something I must tell you
I'll put it in my second favorite thing after you. Please find it

133
00:13:26,177 --> 00:13:27,340
Did everyone see this?

134
00:13:28,122 --> 00:13:30,298
Hwan's dad is seriously respectable!

135
00:13:30,806 --> 00:13:34,045
Everyone's relieved
since your dad got elected

136
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,086
Thanks, Hwan

137
00:15:07,179 --> 00:15:09,723
Too much water rots the roots of a tree

138
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:13,435
and too much contemplation becomes poison

139
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,603
I'm sorry, I'll clean it up right away

140
00:15:33,897 --> 00:15:36,776
- Excuse me, Principal Jo
- Yes

141
00:15:39,655 --> 00:15:41,618
About the rumors during the election...

142
00:15:46,789 --> 00:15:48,042
I think you

143
00:15:49,641 --> 00:15:51,620
might know the truth

144
00:15:55,370 --> 00:16:00,152
If it's about the relationship between
your dad and Cein's mother,

145
00:16:00,153 --> 00:16:02,542
it's not appropriate to discuss at school

146
00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:08,562
And perhaps your dad would know better

147
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:13,720
My father doesn't seem to
want to talk about it...

148
00:16:14,924 --> 00:16:18,765
Sometimes it looks like
he really doesn't remember

149
00:16:20,365 --> 00:16:21,569
Is that so?

150
00:16:23,014 --> 00:16:27,041
Scholarship students of
that year were particularly close...

151
00:16:29,712 --> 00:16:32,492
As you grow older,

152
00:16:32,493 --> 00:16:35,250
would you forget about your friends?

153
00:16:38,227 --> 00:16:40,907
There are two possibilities

154
00:16:42,113 --> 00:16:44,077
Either you really don't remember

155
00:16:44,563 --> 00:16:47,311
or pretend not to remember

156
00:16:49,837 --> 00:16:51,051
Unfortunately

157
00:16:51,892 --> 00:16:55,674
many students from that
year of scholarship had unhappy lives

158
00:16:56,909 --> 00:17:00,348
and for a politician,
everything can be a weakness

159
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,537
But to completely ignore his friends...

160
00:17:05,947 --> 00:17:08,032
Why don't you ask him directly?

161
00:17:09,468 --> 00:17:10,979
Directly?

162
00:17:13,402 --> 00:17:14,789
Run, run, come on

163
00:17:15,295 --> 00:17:16,873
Hey, take out your earphones!

164
00:17:16,874 --> 00:17:18,835
Don't you take out the earphones? Huh?

165
00:17:21,282 --> 00:17:22,519
Good morning, Sir

166
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:27,554
Cein...

167
00:17:28,903 --> 00:17:30,878
Hey, you

168
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:32,565
Your tie, tie

169
00:17:33,222 --> 00:17:34,320
You should tie it, man

170
00:17:36,258 --> 00:17:37,730
Ah, this guy, sigh

171
00:18:08,277 --> 00:18:10,743
- Ma'am, is Hosu here?
- Over there

172
00:18:14,765 --> 00:18:15,928
Hey, Hosu

173
00:18:17,085 --> 00:18:18,296
Hey, Hosu

174
00:18:21,492 --> 00:18:22,802
They say you fainted again

175
00:18:22,803 --> 00:18:25,105
- What?
- How did you know?

176
00:18:25,474 --> 00:18:27,082
Everyone was whispering about it

177
00:18:27,832 --> 00:18:29,224
They say it happened
on the first-floor stairs

178
00:18:29,727 --> 00:18:30,882
Yeah, it did

179
00:18:31,564 --> 00:18:33,263
Recently, it happens without any sign

180
00:18:34,455 --> 00:18:35,643
Hey, are you maybe...

181
00:18:45,311 --> 00:18:46,490
Maybe what?

182
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:49,884
Isn't it...

183
00:18:51,145 --> 00:18:53,060
because you're not taking
your medications properly?

184
00:18:54,081 --> 00:18:55,372
Ah, it's not that

185
00:18:55,883 --> 00:18:57,587
I think the medications
don't work for me well

186
00:18:58,334 --> 00:19:00,303
I moved hospital and changed medications

187
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:05,405
Why?

188
00:19:06,749 --> 00:19:07,951
Is there something on my face?

189
00:19:08,965 --> 00:19:10,000
What's up?

190
00:19:12,124 --> 00:19:14,439
Hey, your face is really red

191
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,619
Do you have a fever?

192
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:18,013
- You have a cold, right?
- No

193
00:19:19,189 --> 00:19:20,391
I'm fine

194
00:19:22,673 --> 00:19:23,842
Are you really okay?

195
00:19:24,353 --> 00:19:26,392
It's nothing, what...

196
00:19:28,435 --> 00:19:29,637
What?

197
00:19:30,558 --> 00:19:31,908
I mean, you...

198
00:19:32,576 --> 00:19:33,700
Ah, sigh

199
00:19:37,149 --> 00:19:38,393
Are you okay?

200
00:19:38,783 --> 00:19:41,021
- I'm okay, I'm okay
- You fainted again!

201
00:19:41,398 --> 00:19:42,615
Where!

202
00:19:43,128 --> 00:19:45,243
- How bad?
- Hey, hey, hey!

203
00:19:46,262 --> 00:19:48,599
Ah, celebrities can't afford to get hurt

204
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,683
It becomes too famous

205
00:19:50,034 --> 00:19:51,414
It's not the first or
second time I fainted

206
00:19:51,415 --> 00:19:53,281
I'm worried because
it's not just once or twice

207
00:19:54,115 --> 00:19:55,545
You've been fainting a lot lately

208
00:19:55,957 --> 00:19:57,021
Is it because of stress?

209
00:19:58,243 --> 00:20:00,239
You don't have to worry about
the redevelopment anymore

210
00:20:01,147 --> 00:20:02,789
Hwan's dad is firmly handling it

211
00:20:03,386 --> 00:20:05,008
You've been too busy lately

212
00:20:05,696 --> 00:20:07,712
Attending classes for a certificate

213
00:20:07,713 --> 00:20:09,581
and going up to Seoul for auditions

214
00:20:09,582 --> 00:20:11,195
- Right?
- Yeah

215
00:20:11,707 --> 00:20:13,066
There must be a reason

216
00:20:13,887 --> 00:20:15,103
I think

217
00:20:15,959 --> 00:20:17,454
it's definitely because
of that certificate

218
00:20:17,455 --> 00:20:18,644
That's kind of exam, right?

219
00:20:19,162 --> 00:20:20,691
Bro, you can't do it, it's not for you

220
00:20:21,093 --> 00:20:22,386
You're just like me

221
00:20:22,977 --> 00:20:24,071
You're not cut out for studying

222
00:20:24,072 --> 00:20:25,880
That's really ridiculous, hey

223
00:20:26,281 --> 00:20:29,394
It's true I'm not talented
in studies compared to other things

224
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:32,369
but being in the same group
as you is the real problem

225
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:35,738
Hey, and my landscaping teacher
said I'm really talented

226
00:20:35,739 --> 00:20:38,256
Do you have to wear those band-aids
on your hands if you're talented?

227
00:20:38,257 --> 00:20:39,446
Band-aids...

228
00:20:40,569 --> 00:20:43,280
This is like a badge of honor, a badge!

229
00:20:43,281 --> 00:20:46,171
You need to get this kind
of injury to earn the certificate

230
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:48,215
Anyway, it's a relief

231
00:20:48,518 --> 00:20:51,115
I thought you were badly hurt because
they said there was a lot of blood

232
00:20:52,118 --> 00:20:53,825
Aaagh!

233
00:20:54,957 --> 00:20:56,130
Hey, why are you there...

234
00:20:57,049 --> 00:20:58,275
I know

235
00:20:58,276 --> 00:21:00,467
- Are you okay?
- Harder! Harder!

236
00:21:01,638 --> 00:21:02,895
Enough! Ah, it hurts

237
00:21:03,715 --> 00:21:05,199
Hwan, do you have a tail?

238
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,752
Ah, why did you hit there...

239
00:21:07,739 --> 00:21:10,167
- What's with him?
- Bro, how long have you been here?

240
00:21:11,337 --> 00:21:12,765
I came here before him

241
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:16,439
Perfect character for our elder!

242
00:21:16,769 --> 00:21:18,640
If there's a spot, he lies down first

243
00:21:19,889 --> 00:21:21,183
Anyway, in the end, everyone

244
00:21:21,865 --> 00:21:23,570
got here instead of that closed hideout?

245
00:21:24,935 --> 00:21:26,286
Ah, except for that one person

246
00:21:36,594 --> 00:21:38,082
I know who it is without looking

247
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:39,550
What's this?

248
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,907
A key?

249
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,144
What is this?

250
00:21:46,835 --> 00:21:49,774
Everyone must be going crazy
wondering what this key is for, right?

251
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:59,054
What, no reply?

252
00:22:00,737 --> 00:22:01,851
Ah!

253
00:22:02,787 --> 00:22:04,402
I guess I didn't give enough hints

254
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:08,494
What's this key everyone's buzzing about?

255
00:22:10,193 --> 00:22:11,300
Why no answer?

256
00:22:11,867 --> 00:22:13,035
Is it too hard?

257
00:22:13,446 --> 00:22:14,512
Should I give a hint?

258
00:22:15,008 --> 00:22:17,480
Who wants a hint, shout out
and throw your pants!

259
00:22:21,209 --> 00:22:22,522
Do I have to guess this?

260
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:24,218
In case he comes to find me

261
00:22:24,867 --> 00:22:26,211
Just leave it

262
00:22:26,212 --> 00:22:28,083
Anyway, it's his loss if he comes

263
00:22:28,934 --> 00:22:30,280
He'll get told off again

264
00:22:31,547 --> 00:22:33,229
Ah, thank you for the meal today

265
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:34,874
Keep up the good work

266
00:22:44,137 --> 00:22:45,593
Do you still manage

267
00:22:46,618 --> 00:22:47,808
the principal's orchid?

268
00:22:49,155 --> 00:22:50,358
Yeah

269
00:22:54,844 --> 00:22:55,857
Why?

270
00:22:57,924 --> 00:22:59,997
Do you keep doing it because you want to?

271
00:23:05,001 --> 00:23:06,201
What are you talking about?

272
00:23:09,197 --> 00:23:10,378
Just wondering...

273
00:23:12,214 --> 00:23:14,208
if the principal forced you to do it...

274
00:23:17,776 --> 00:23:18,897
Never mind then

275
00:23:56,882 --> 00:23:58,082
Are you really okay?

276
00:25:23,018 --> 00:25:25,016
Why is everyone ghosting me?

277
00:25:26,527 --> 00:25:27,570
Ah, geez

278
00:25:29,826 --> 00:25:30,947
Damn

279
00:25:35,649 --> 00:25:36,751
What the...

280
00:25:50,596 --> 00:25:51,647
Jeha Jeon!

281
00:25:52,305 --> 00:25:53,829
- What?
- Isn't he there?

282
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:54,957
Why, is it locked?

283
00:25:56,978 --> 00:25:59,342
He was all excited in the chat,
where did he go?

284
00:25:59,743 --> 00:26:00,999
Doesn't seem like he's here

285
00:26:01,392 --> 00:26:03,014
- Let's go
- What? No, no

286
00:26:03,015 --> 00:26:05,647
- It's right, right here
- Hey, open the door

287
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:10,013
Unfortunately, I'll only let those in
who get my question right

288
00:26:10,423 --> 00:26:11,631
What?

289
00:26:11,632 --> 00:26:14,022
- What's he saying?
- Okay, here's the question

290
00:26:14,703 --> 00:26:16,232
What is Jeha Jeon most afraid of?

291
00:26:16,851 --> 00:26:18,214
Ah, this is too easy

292
00:26:19,145 --> 00:26:20,272
So cute

293
00:26:20,843 --> 00:26:22,918
- Ghosts?
- I can't hear you!

294
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,628
What?

295
00:26:25,725 --> 00:26:26,923
Is it too hard?

296
00:26:27,433 --> 00:26:29,307
Should I give a hint? Do you want it?

297
00:26:29,876 --> 00:26:31,056
If you want it,

298
00:26:31,394 --> 00:26:33,435
say, 'Big Brother Jeha'

299
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:39,387
Ah, just kidding

300
00:26:40,305 --> 00:26:41,346
I'll give you a hint

301
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:42,824
It's four letters

302
00:26:45,162 --> 00:26:47,217
S.T.O.P

303
00:26:47,714 --> 00:26:48,828
J.O.K.E?

304
00:26:50,258 --> 00:26:51,863
O.P.E.N

305
00:26:52,439 --> 00:26:54,079
D.E.A.D

306
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:56,464
I.F N.O,

307
00:26:58,646 --> 00:26:59,725
K.I.L.L

308
00:27:04,569 --> 00:27:09,589
Ah, guys, it's just a joke,
why are you guys so angry?

309
00:27:10,673 --> 00:27:11,839
Let's just go

310
00:27:12,348 --> 00:27:13,364
- Let's go
- Yeah, let's go

311
00:27:18,648 --> 00:27:20,365
Hey! Wait a minute!

312
00:27:20,732 --> 00:27:21,830
Just a minute...

313
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:27,184
Ah, come on

314
00:27:27,185 --> 00:27:28,362
You all ignore my chat

315
00:27:28,363 --> 00:27:29,865
If you don't want to come, then don't

316
00:27:29,866 --> 00:27:31,557
You know how hard it was
for me to open here?

317
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:33,622
Don't come? Really?

318
00:27:34,202 --> 00:27:35,679
Yeah, don't come

319
00:27:36,532 --> 00:27:38,225
Okay, let's go!

320
00:27:38,226 --> 00:27:39,579
- Let's go
- Let's go

321
00:27:40,911 --> 00:27:42,137
Ah, really, geez!

322
00:27:44,988 --> 00:27:46,539
Ah, really...

323
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,836
Ding-dong

324
00:27:49,233 --> 00:27:50,741
Aww, how cute

325
00:27:50,742 --> 00:27:53,001
Oh my, our middle schooler

326
00:27:53,002 --> 00:27:54,731
How did you make the key?

327
00:28:05,048 --> 00:28:07,202
I found a matching lock and attached it

328
00:28:08,621 --> 00:28:09,928
Now no one else can open this

329
00:28:09,929 --> 00:28:11,458
Not even disciplinarian, why?

330
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,019
Because I'm the only one who has it

331
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,979
Wow, Jeha, you're smart

332
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:20,334
But why don't you bring
that brain to tutoring, huh?

333
00:28:20,335 --> 00:28:22,727
What do you mean?
My grades have gone up lately

334
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:25,436
- Of course, all thanks to you
- Yes, right

335
00:28:25,805 --> 00:28:26,943
Jeha Jeon is the best

336
00:28:26,944 --> 00:28:28,474
You are the real deal, happy now?

337
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,951
By the way, it's been a long
since Cein lay down there

338
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:39,331
We haven't been here
in a long time, right?

339
00:28:40,342 --> 00:28:41,713
When was the last time we came?

340
00:28:44,095 --> 00:28:45,116
That day

341
00:28:45,527 --> 00:28:46,598
In the summer

342
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,014
- Before the final exams
- Around that time

343
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:51,384
Found that body on the beach

344
00:28:52,808 --> 00:28:54,413
They said that person
committed suicide, right?

345
00:28:54,414 --> 00:28:55,768
Ah, that person?

346
00:28:56,626 --> 00:28:57,817
Wasn't he a senior at our school?

347
00:28:58,906 --> 00:29:00,905
He came to our school before he died

348
00:29:01,434 --> 00:29:02,949
My classmate Junsu saw him
when he was playing soccer

349
00:29:04,045 --> 00:29:07,194
That's why the detectives came
to school and met the principal...

350
00:29:09,259 --> 00:29:10,383
What?

351
00:29:11,706 --> 00:29:13,896
Why did he come here so creepily?

352
00:29:14,304 --> 00:29:15,595
Because he's an alumnus of this school

353
00:29:16,489 --> 00:29:19,163
People tend to visit memorable
places before they die

354
00:29:20,493 --> 00:29:21,724
Right

355
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:24,051
Now that your dad won the election

356
00:29:24,562 --> 00:29:25,783
aren't you going to treat us?

357
00:29:26,692 --> 00:29:27,798
Won?

358
00:29:28,991 --> 00:29:30,636
Ah, you mean elected?

359
00:29:31,471 --> 00:29:34,181
- Yeah, let's have a party!
- Oh, yes

360
00:29:34,594 --> 00:29:36,393
We can have it at your big house

361
00:29:36,927 --> 00:29:40,587
Last time, my dad was
in Seoul, so it was okay

362
00:29:40,588 --> 00:29:42,799
Then let's have a small
party at your container

363
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:44,875
- We should celebrate
- I don't...

364
00:29:45,855 --> 00:29:46,937
mind

365
00:29:46,938 --> 00:29:48,469
Yeah, let's do it there

366
00:29:49,208 --> 00:29:52,895
People say, "Strike while the iron is cold"
how about we do it today?

367
00:29:59,718 --> 00:30:01,537
I know, it's not 'cold'

368
00:30:03,589 --> 00:30:04,856
It's 'warm'

369
00:30:09,582 --> 00:30:10,794
Isn't it 'warm'?

370
00:30:11,381 --> 00:30:12,483
I don't...

371
00:30:13,414 --> 00:30:16,705
even know where to start
to tell you what's wrong...

372
00:30:16,706 --> 00:30:18,258
- Isn't it?
- Wrong?

373
00:30:18,259 --> 00:30:19,926
So, what time is the party today?

374
00:30:20,426 --> 00:30:22,161
Is it 'warm' or 'cold'? Do you know?

375
00:30:23,859 --> 00:30:26,797
Guys, can't we just meet
after dinner, really?

376
00:30:27,355 --> 00:30:29,255
I can't miss dinner, okay?

377
00:30:29,588 --> 00:30:33,019
I'll eat super fast, really

378
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:35,073
I'll just drink my meal, okay? Really!

379
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:41,573
Slow down

380
00:30:42,405 --> 00:30:43,962
Is it because he's growing?

381
00:30:46,741 --> 00:30:48,239
Jeha, do you want to try golf more?

382
00:30:50,968 --> 00:30:52,014
Golf?

383
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:56,186
Yeah, the people we went to
the lounge with last week

384
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:58,123
said Jeha seems to have a talent for golf

385
00:31:00,064 --> 00:31:01,449
It was your first time but you played well

386
00:31:01,966 --> 00:31:04,037
You were almost on par with Mingook,
who's been taking lessons for a long time

387
00:31:04,709 --> 00:31:05,861
Really?

388
00:31:06,528 --> 00:31:09,757
Jeha does have some athletic talent...

389
00:31:10,421 --> 00:31:13,496
That time, I had a cold,
so I wasn't in good condition

390
00:31:14,087 --> 00:31:15,552
I might take him again next week

391
00:31:17,356 --> 00:31:19,322
Oh, Jeha must be so happy

392
00:31:31,898 --> 00:31:33,668
- Thanks for the meal
- Huh?

393
00:31:45,908 --> 00:31:49,063
This is the time to talk
more about golf with dad

394
00:31:49,415 --> 00:31:52,295
I told you, I'm going to Hwan's
Dad's celebration party

395
00:31:53,384 --> 00:31:55,891
You must go golfing with
Dad this weekend, okay?

396
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:57,352
Okay

397
00:32:05,824 --> 00:32:07,122
Cool, Hosu

398
00:32:08,737 --> 00:32:09,891
Lights?

399
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:22,477
Why, why? What's up, why?

400
00:32:22,957 --> 00:32:24,522
I ran right after eating,
my side is so hurt

401
00:32:26,154 --> 00:32:28,271
Since Jeha is here, let's get something

402
00:32:28,865 --> 00:32:30,151
What are we buying?

403
00:32:32,238 --> 00:32:33,958
- I don't have money
- Me neither

404
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:36,770
I left mine...

405
00:32:38,664 --> 00:32:40,971
Since it's my dad's
celebration, I'll treat

406
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,979
Dad gave me his card

407
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:50,091
- Did you steal it?
- No, he gave it to me!

408
00:32:50,092 --> 00:32:53,445
Hwan, can we buy whatever we want?

409
00:32:53,446 --> 00:32:54,977
Yeah, let's buy everything

410
00:32:54,978 --> 00:32:56,507
Let's go!

411
00:32:56,508 --> 00:32:57,867
- Let's go!
- Yes!

412
00:32:59,304 --> 00:33:00,847
Hosu, take the water out of pickle

413
00:33:01,987 --> 00:33:04,035
- Bro, where's the cup?
- Oh, here's the cup

414
00:33:04,773 --> 00:33:07,246
Sir, please get up and help

415
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,387
Ah, seriously...

416
00:33:12,467 --> 00:33:14,455
Give it to me, I'll do it

417
00:33:14,456 --> 00:33:15,698
Hey, I'll do it for you

418
00:33:15,699 --> 00:33:17,342
Why aren't they coming soon?

419
00:33:19,027 --> 00:33:20,229
Jooan, can you help here?

420
00:33:23,597 --> 00:33:25,416
- Mr.Kim
- Welcome

421
00:33:26,411 --> 00:33:27,819
- Congratulations
- Thank you

422
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,007
Nice to meet you

423
00:33:29,008 --> 00:33:31,446
Sir, come here!

424
00:33:31,447 --> 00:33:33,145
- Cein
- Hurry up!

425
00:33:33,994 --> 00:33:35,480
Come on up

426
00:33:35,481 --> 00:33:36,618
Quick!

427
00:33:37,081 --> 00:33:39,342
- Cheers!
- Move

428
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,193
Okay, everybody

429
00:33:42,566 --> 00:33:44,212
Where's your coke?

430
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:49,443
There's coke right here!

431
00:33:54,977 --> 00:33:57,636
Congratulations on
Changjun Kim's win in the election!

432
00:34:01,125 --> 00:34:03,618
Congratulations, legislator!

433
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:16,420
Let's go! Assemblyman Changjun Kim!

434
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:18,295
Let's go!

435
00:34:25,268 --> 00:34:26,352
Chief

436
00:34:26,926 --> 00:34:28,118
Oh, Mr.Kim

437
00:34:28,516 --> 00:34:30,172
Jangwon Seo from Songju Police Station

438
00:34:30,172 --> 00:34:33,775
I greeted you last time about
your son's issue, remember?

439
00:34:33,775 --> 00:34:36,906
You know you got elected because I stepped
down from the primaries and supported you

440
00:34:36,907 --> 00:34:38,534
You owe me this time

441
00:34:39,447 --> 00:34:41,050
When your father was legislator

442
00:34:41,051 --> 00:34:44,560
I started as a driver,
cleaned cars, polished shoes,

443
00:34:45,299 --> 00:34:47,367
and took care of your dad's issue...

444
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:51,929
I'm not interested in politics

445
00:34:51,929 --> 00:34:54,243
I just bought some property,
not the main area,

446
00:34:54,754 --> 00:34:56,765
just next to it

447
00:34:56,766 --> 00:35:00,096
but it's awkwardly located
in the redevelopment zone

448
00:35:02,998 --> 00:35:05,324
Mr.Kim, the chief of Songju Daily,
Sangjun Lee, is here

449
00:35:07,144 --> 00:35:08,350
I'll see you later

450
00:35:08,351 --> 00:35:09,576
My property...

451
00:35:55,996 --> 00:35:57,265
It's coming!

452
00:35:57,850 --> 00:35:59,301
Take it easy

453
00:35:59,302 --> 00:36:01,950
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!
- One!

454
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:04,501
- Let's go!
- One, two, three!

455
00:36:06,674 --> 00:36:07,854
One, two

456
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,736
What, didn't you get it right?

457
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:18,107
Did I...

458
00:36:20,217 --> 00:36:21,485
forget something?

459
00:36:21,935 --> 00:36:22,972
Sorry?

460
00:36:25,409 --> 00:36:27,549
Something you forgot or
something you lost?

461
00:36:40,047 --> 00:36:41,162
Oh!

462
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,873
We met at that meeting, right?

463
00:36:51,942 --> 00:36:52,958
Did you really

464
00:36:55,295 --> 00:36:56,517
forget everything?

465
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,109
I postponed today's meeting with the
Economic Federation to next week due to the schedule

466
00:37:02,858 --> 00:37:04,468
Don't worry too much

467
00:37:07,096 --> 00:37:08,308
Ah...

468
00:37:14,585 --> 00:37:15,763
Is that it?

469
00:37:23,554 --> 00:37:25,052
But when are you guys leaving?

470
00:37:26,478 --> 00:37:28,085
- I'm going to sleep here
- Me too, me too!

471
00:37:28,595 --> 00:37:29,628
So be it

472
00:37:30,949 --> 00:37:32,243
Achoo

473
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,902
Ah, come on

474
00:37:37,686 --> 00:37:38,942
Is it really a cold?

475
00:37:41,287 --> 00:37:44,618
But isn't it time for the
middle schooler to go home?

476
00:37:45,018 --> 00:37:47,667
Go brush your teeth and sleep

477
00:37:48,665 --> 00:37:50,222
I need to ask my Mom too

478
00:37:50,223 --> 00:37:52,423
I need to ask my Mom too

479
00:37:52,831 --> 00:37:54,039
It's cold, get something to wear

480
00:37:54,449 --> 00:37:56,123
Mom, please just for today!

481
00:37:57,725 --> 00:37:59,523
I told you I'll go golfing
with Dad this weekend

482
00:38:05,375 --> 00:38:06,443
Alright

483
00:38:08,393 --> 00:38:10,379
Then you have to allow me
next time for sure!

484
00:38:14,343 --> 00:38:15,395
Okay

485
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,576
What?

486
00:38:34,241 --> 00:38:36,218
Hey! The door won't open!

487
00:38:40,132 --> 00:38:41,659
Say the password

488
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:43,696
Hey, the kid's crying

489
00:38:43,697 --> 00:38:45,394
Open it, please!

490
00:38:46,077 --> 00:38:48,009
Ah, always picking on only me!

491
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:49,880
Try pushing harder

492
00:38:53,064 --> 00:38:54,359
He left?

493
00:38:54,939 --> 00:38:56,287
Seems like he left

494
00:39:01,115 --> 00:39:05,394
Did you think I wouldn't open the door?

495
00:39:07,138 --> 00:39:08,380
What are you doing?

496
00:39:10,872 --> 00:39:12,882
Hey, you'll get hurt, hey

497
00:39:12,883 --> 00:39:14,420
Hey, wait a moment

498
00:39:14,421 --> 00:39:15,842
Stuck? Hey, is it stuck?

499
00:39:15,843 --> 00:39:18,223
- I'll get you out
- Hey, don't pull

500
00:39:19,238 --> 00:39:21,391
- No, no!
- No?

501
00:39:21,392 --> 00:39:23,089
- We should push
- Push?

502
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:25,138
Only Dissolution Leads to Survival!

503
00:39:25,139 --> 00:39:27,150
They said this place
would be redeveloped...

504
00:39:27,661 --> 00:39:30,248
If it doesn't happen, what then?

505
00:39:31,809 --> 00:39:35,576
Well, rich people will buy it
and sell it for more

506
00:39:36,753 --> 00:39:39,234
The real landlord never
gets their hands dirty

507
00:39:40,222 --> 00:39:43,286
Wow. You've been reading books, huh?

508
00:39:43,523 --> 00:39:45,161
Mocking me, middle schooler?

509
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:47,369
You are really weird lately

510
00:39:48,558 --> 00:39:49,920
Reading books you never read,

511
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:52,470
and wandering around at night

512
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:54,174
Hey

513
00:39:57,739 --> 00:39:58,917
How do you know?

514
00:39:59,428 --> 00:40:00,830
That I wander at night?

515
00:40:02,319 --> 00:40:03,777
Uh, I...

516
00:40:04,821 --> 00:40:07,043
Uh, I saw you a few times

517
00:40:08,423 --> 00:40:10,280
You went to Munhyeon
Bus Stop yesterday, right?

518
00:40:10,877 --> 00:40:12,153
You saw me?

519
00:40:12,154 --> 00:40:13,261
Really?

520
00:40:14,474 --> 00:40:15,695
I was just

521
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:19,467
passing by in my Dad's car and saw you

522
00:40:19,776 --> 00:40:21,000
entering the bus terminal

523
00:40:24,612 --> 00:40:25,802
Just

524
00:40:26,836 --> 00:40:28,966
I felt stuffy being at home all the time

525
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:33,897
Sigh, you should've asked me to come along

526
00:40:33,898 --> 00:40:36,107
Forget it, man, you've been busy too

527
00:40:36,613 --> 00:40:37,970
Playing the good son

528
00:40:39,493 --> 00:40:40,756
That's just

529
00:40:41,668 --> 00:40:44,332
so Dad treats me well, and Mom likes it

530
00:40:45,762 --> 00:40:48,641
Stepdad praises me for being good at golf

531
00:40:49,221 --> 00:40:51,025
Improved grades and golf too?

532
00:40:52,563 --> 00:40:54,291
But it felt weirdly good

533
00:40:56,343 --> 00:40:58,748
It's natural to feel good when praised

534
00:40:58,749 --> 00:40:59,938
Why is that weird?

535
00:41:00,587 --> 00:41:01,775
Just

536
00:41:02,619 --> 00:41:05,006
I knew the stepdad won't like me
no matter what I do,

537
00:41:05,721 --> 00:41:07,434
I didn't feel anything until now

538
00:41:09,135 --> 00:41:11,031
But being pampered suddenly felt good

539
00:41:14,212 --> 00:41:15,598
But it's not going to work out anyway

540
00:41:16,741 --> 00:41:18,782
For stepdad, there's only one son, Mingook

541
00:41:34,657 --> 00:41:37,311
I feel sorry for Jeha

542
00:41:39,185 --> 00:41:41,561
He's still a kid, but he knows too much

543
00:41:43,823 --> 00:41:46,030
Jeha is kid, but he's not weak

544
00:41:46,607 --> 00:41:48,407
Sometimes, when I hear
what he talks about,

545
00:41:48,896 --> 00:41:50,612
it's creepy because it feels
like he's older than me,

546
00:41:51,399 --> 00:41:52,512
Ah!

547
00:41:53,358 --> 00:41:55,578
Hwan, weren't you going
back to the apartment?

548
00:41:56,968 --> 00:41:58,870
I was planning to go
tomorrow, after packing

549
00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:02,446
Take care on your way

550
00:42:06,848 --> 00:42:07,967
Hwan

551
00:42:10,113 --> 00:42:11,170
Can I...

552
00:42:12,194 --> 00:42:13,500
go to your house?

553
00:42:17,156 --> 00:42:18,267
Uh...

554
00:42:21,142 --> 00:42:23,635
That's too much, isn't it?

555
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:26,967
It's just...

556
00:42:28,302 --> 00:42:30,196
strange that I don't want to go home today

557
00:42:32,875 --> 00:42:34,015
Bye

558
00:42:44,318 --> 00:42:45,511
Cein

559
00:42:46,352 --> 00:42:48,215
Wow, look at this turn!

560
00:42:49,057 --> 00:42:51,473
Hey bro, are you sleeping?

561
00:42:51,474 --> 00:42:52,483
Isn't it cool?

562
00:42:52,901 --> 00:42:54,473
I'm cool, aren't I?

563
00:42:56,442 --> 00:42:59,109
But I think a kid
in my class does better...

564
00:43:02,803 --> 00:43:04,481
Do you know
anything about dancing, do you?

565
00:43:04,482 --> 00:43:06,360
This is the essence of a dancing machine

566
00:43:06,962 --> 00:43:08,241
I'll just keep it for myself

567
00:43:08,242 --> 00:43:10,049
You, subscribe while I go toilet

568
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:11,242
and click "Like"

569
00:43:11,243 --> 00:43:13,129
- Haru, subscribe too, okay?
- Okay

570
00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:21,228
You subscribe, too

571
00:43:26,534 --> 00:43:29,127
Yep, hanging out with friends at a party

572
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:42,390
What, do you have a girlfriend?

573
00:43:42,856 --> 00:43:44,588
No, just a friend

574
00:43:45,239 --> 00:43:46,972
Yeah, a girlfriend is also a friend

575
00:43:47,482 --> 00:43:49,182
What are you saying,
she's really just a friend

576
00:43:50,024 --> 00:43:53,646
Ah, that Munhyeon Middle,
now Munhyeon High?

577
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:58,458
You talk too much with her
and seem too close recently

578
00:43:58,938 --> 00:44:02,643
What's that, we just get along well...

579
00:44:03,315 --> 00:44:05,702
Hey, so we don't get along?

580
00:44:06,588 --> 00:44:10,277
- Jooan, I like you and everyone else
- Me or her?

581
00:44:11,708 --> 00:44:13,507
What's 'me or her?'

582
00:44:13,508 --> 00:44:16,057
If she and I fall in the water,
who would you save first?

583
00:44:19,943 --> 00:44:22,631
Uh, hey!

584
00:44:24,371 --> 00:44:25,678
Did you just hesitate?

585
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:28,227
You asked so suddenly

586
00:44:28,733 --> 00:44:30,771
Hey, even if I ask you when you sleep

587
00:44:31,603 --> 00:44:34,126
shouldn't it come out like
'Uh? Of course, it's you'?

588
00:44:34,374 --> 00:44:36,856
Really disappointed, really sad

589
00:44:37,535 --> 00:44:39,258
- I mean, Jooan...
- Don't

590
00:44:39,649 --> 00:44:42,160
- Jooan, I mean...
- No, that's enough

591
00:44:42,161 --> 00:44:43,851
Go play with that friend

592
00:44:44,445 --> 00:44:45,892
Some stranger is here

593
00:44:46,137 --> 00:44:47,465
Bro, there is a st...

594
00:44:48,226 --> 00:44:49,941
stranger here!

595
00:45:03,762 --> 00:45:06,157
- Hey
- Yeah, it's almost done

596
00:45:11,759 --> 00:45:14,409
Wow, you can even do this?

597
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,630
I lived alone in the US

598
00:45:17,728 --> 00:45:21,016
And here, living alone, my skills
only improved making ramen

599
00:45:22,026 --> 00:45:23,386
I'm benefiting from that

600
00:45:24,136 --> 00:45:25,921
- May I use the restroom?
- Yeah, go ahead

601
00:45:54,218 --> 00:45:55,437
Does he want to add an egg?

602
00:46:27,221 --> 00:46:28,366
What are you doing?

603
00:46:29,372 --> 00:46:30,533
Here...

604
00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:35,891
Uh, Hwan, that's...

605
00:46:48,270 --> 00:46:49,382
Ramen is ready

606
00:46:50,578 --> 00:46:51,595
Come out

607
00:46:54,819 --> 00:46:55,840
Okay

608
00:47:19,491 --> 00:47:20,569
I'm sorry

609
00:47:22,428 --> 00:47:23,982
I was just too curious

610
00:47:26,755 --> 00:47:27,786
I know

611
00:47:31,551 --> 00:47:32,702
It's not someone else's business

612
00:47:34,457 --> 00:47:35,662
It's about your mom

613
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,160
But I shouldn't have done that...

614
00:47:47,397 --> 00:47:48,681
It is just...

615
00:47:51,135 --> 00:47:53,207
I just wanted to know the truth

616
00:47:56,405 --> 00:47:59,489
The truth that Mom isn't the person
the principal talked about

617
00:48:01,357 --> 00:48:03,088
or at least make it easy

618
00:48:05,397 --> 00:48:07,197
If I could just know the truth,

619
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:11,877
I thought I would feel a bit more at peace

620
00:48:18,259 --> 00:48:19,354
It might...

621
00:48:21,498 --> 00:48:23,114
not be like that

622
00:48:28,151 --> 00:48:29,159
What...

623
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:34,950
What might not be like that?

624
00:48:37,731 --> 00:48:38,996
Is there something you found?

625
00:48:54,244 --> 00:48:55,261
I'll go

626
00:48:56,402 --> 00:48:57,436
Take care

627
00:49:23,174 --> 00:49:24,273
No

628
00:49:26,614 --> 00:49:27,809
Nothing much, really

629
00:49:39,381 --> 00:49:42,442
More than half are
in favor of redevelopment

630
00:49:42,443 --> 00:49:44,075
It seems it will proceed smoothly

631
00:49:46,954 --> 00:49:48,325
Can I come in for a moment?

632
00:49:48,697 --> 00:49:49,707
Sure

633
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:59,020
Thank you for the card

634
00:49:59,598 --> 00:50:00,870
Keep it

635
00:50:01,467 --> 00:50:02,651
Buy what you need

636
00:50:08,075 --> 00:50:09,113
Dad

637
00:50:09,938 --> 00:50:10,967
Do you know

638
00:50:11,794 --> 00:50:13,358
Eunjoo Kim?

639
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:21,971
Eunjoo Kim...

640
00:50:24,635 --> 00:50:25,645
Who's that?

641
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:30,866
- Someone you know?
- No, Eunjoo Kim...

642
00:50:32,301 --> 00:50:33,376
Who's that?

643
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:35,325
Why?

644
00:50:35,805 --> 00:50:37,132
Does that person know me?

645
00:50:38,289 --> 00:50:39,292
Never mind

646
00:50:40,876 --> 00:50:41,985
I'll be going

647
00:50:45,953 --> 00:50:47,462
What's the next schedule?

648
00:50:47,463 --> 00:50:49,337
There's a general meeting with
employees of Songju City

649
00:50:52,835 --> 00:50:56,365
There are two possibilities

650
00:50:58,522 --> 00:51:00,030
either you really don't remember

651
00:51:00,531 --> 00:51:03,075
or pretend not to remember

652
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:20,199
Mokryeon Mansion
Bro!

653
00:51:23,086 --> 00:51:25,467
- Hurry up, you punk
- Sorry

654
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:30,234
Let's go!

655
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:40,432
Was that Dohyeon's friend
he was talking about?

656
00:51:49,681 --> 00:51:51,313
Bro, where are you?

657
00:51:53,663 --> 00:51:56,581
That guy, Dohyeon's friend,
does he live in our apartment?

658
00:51:56,582 --> 00:51:58,489
I've never even seen their faces

659
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:00,757
- Dohyeon went crazy about it
- Oh, right

660
00:52:00,758 --> 00:52:01,784
Why?

661
00:52:02,117 --> 00:52:04,234
It seems like Dohyeon still
gets along with those guys

662
00:52:04,828 --> 00:52:06,648
They just rode off
together on a motorcycle

663
00:52:12,035 --> 00:52:13,746
It woke me up completely

664
00:52:14,554 --> 00:52:16,659
Why is he asking for the hideout key
in the middle of the night?

665
00:52:17,469 --> 00:52:19,262
Cein Min, you little!

666
00:52:19,758 --> 00:52:20,868
If he wasn't older than me...

667
00:52:22,285 --> 00:52:23,817
Is there something in there
that only I don't know about?

668
00:52:27,085 --> 00:52:29,465
Jeha, do you still have the hideout key?

669
00:52:29,848 --> 00:52:31,906
Well, there is one more...

670
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:35,995
Why?

671
00:53:09,490 --> 00:53:12,632
After Mom cleared out
her favorite piano academy

672
00:53:12,633 --> 00:53:13,915
I'll put it in

673
00:53:15,141 --> 00:53:17,180
my second favorite thing after you

674
00:53:18,954 --> 00:53:20,106
Please find it

675
00:53:54,347 --> 00:53:55,597
Do you need a help?

676
00:53:57,341 --> 00:53:58,353
Huh?

677
00:53:59,913 --> 00:54:02,414
When did you come?

678
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:05,142
Just now, the door is open

679
00:54:08,185 --> 00:54:10,094
- What are you doing?
- Ah, I...

680
00:54:10,871 --> 00:54:13,124
I think I left something here

681
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:18,201
What you left is inside there?

682
00:54:19,944 --> 00:54:20,980
Maybe

683
00:54:22,721 --> 00:54:23,904
It doesn't seem to be here, though

684
00:54:36,315 --> 00:54:37,408
Cein

685
00:54:39,967 --> 00:54:42,337
- Aren't you leaving?
- Ah...

686
00:54:43,252 --> 00:54:44,889
I'll take a nap here before I go

687
00:54:45,568 --> 00:54:46,590
You go first

688
00:54:48,279 --> 00:54:49,738
Oh, okay...

689
00:56:46,634 --> 00:56:48,096
The person who finds this

690
00:56:48,594 --> 00:56:51,483
is the person
Mom loves the most in the world

691
00:58:07,486 --> 00:58:08,624
Did you talk to Dohyeon yet?

692
00:58:09,944 --> 00:58:11,139
At the facility?

693
00:58:12,807 --> 00:58:15,049
I know those punks' faces.
If I see them...

694
00:58:20,828 --> 00:58:21,848
Wait a minute

695
00:58:27,486 --> 00:58:28,792
Hey, what time is it?

696
00:58:28,793 --> 00:58:31,091
- 10:30. Hey, look at this
- Hey, yo!

697
00:58:31,092 --> 00:58:33,243
- Why are you so late?
- You are so late

698
00:58:33,244 --> 00:58:34,363
What are you talking about?

699
00:58:34,936 --> 00:58:36,570
- Eh?
- 30 minutes late

700
00:58:36,571 --> 00:58:37,908
Those punks?

701
00:58:38,892 --> 00:58:41,769
- The guy from Munhyeon High...
- Whose is that last one?

702
00:58:44,205 --> 00:58:46,090
Oh, it's for my friend

703
00:58:46,091 --> 00:58:47,236
He's graduating today too

704
00:58:47,237 --> 00:58:48,937
Ah, that Munhyeon Middle

705
00:58:49,245 --> 00:58:50,399
now Munhyeon High?

706
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:51,589
Really the same clothes?

707
00:58:55,161 --> 00:58:57,711
Damn, bro, wait, I'll call you again

708
00:59:03,522 --> 00:59:05,749
- Unavailable...
- Ah, Haru, never picks up

709
00:59:28,072 --> 00:59:29,154
Eh?

710
00:59:30,569 --> 00:59:32,731
- Hey, Jooan
- Hey, what are you doing!

711
00:59:32,732 --> 00:59:34,277
Why aren't you answering the phone!

712
00:59:34,278 --> 00:59:35,550
I was changing my clothes

713
00:59:36,031 --> 00:59:38,017
- Why are you angry all of a sudden?
- Where are you?

714
00:59:38,937 --> 00:59:40,396
Will you meet that punk today?

715
00:59:41,331 --> 00:59:43,456
Yeah, I'm about to meet him

716
00:59:43,936 --> 00:59:45,666
- Why?
- Hey, don't meet him

717
00:59:46,415 --> 00:59:47,530
Huh?

718
00:59:48,552 --> 00:59:50,204
Why are you like that...

719
00:59:50,205 --> 00:59:52,244
Anyway, don't go!

720
00:59:52,823 --> 00:59:54,003
If you go out today,

721
00:59:54,413 --> 00:59:56,050
I won't see you for the rest of my life!

722
01:00:12,298 --> 01:00:13,454
What is it?

723
01:00:14,037 --> 01:00:16,954
- Where are you?
- To meet a friend. Want to come?

724
01:00:17,802 --> 01:00:19,150
Here at the apartment's main stairs...

725
01:00:20,896 --> 01:00:21,916
Hey!

726
01:00:25,746 --> 01:00:27,833
- Hey, what's up?
- Listen

727
01:00:28,479 --> 01:00:29,758
Do you know Haru Park, or not?

728
01:00:30,374 --> 01:00:31,834
Haru...

729
01:00:32,343 --> 01:00:34,053
Ah, that psycho?

730
01:00:37,428 --> 01:00:39,153
- Hey!
- What's wrong with you?

731
01:00:40,402 --> 01:00:41,762
Don't mess with Haru Park

732
01:00:42,922 --> 01:00:45,709
I'll kill everyone if anyone
touches him, got it?

733
01:00:48,747 --> 01:00:50,676
- Hey!
- Who's that?

734
01:00:50,888 --> 01:00:52,509
- Hey
- Are you okay?

735
01:01:04,584 --> 01:01:05,610
Hey, Jooan

736
01:01:06,658 --> 01:01:07,737
What's this?

737
01:01:08,218 --> 01:01:09,324
Are you outside?

738
01:01:11,176 --> 01:01:12,806
- Yeah
- Hey, damn

739
01:01:13,997 --> 01:01:16,373
Why are you like this all of a sudden,
at least give me a reason

740
01:01:18,290 --> 01:01:20,528
I told you not to meet him!

741
01:01:21,904 --> 01:01:23,769
Those punks are bad guys

742
01:01:24,451 --> 01:01:27,001
They're the ones who messed up Dohyeon!

743
01:01:28,652 --> 01:01:29,966
Ah, whatever

744
01:01:30,650 --> 01:01:31,844
Where are you now?

745
01:01:33,369 --> 01:01:34,894
Where are you now!

746
01:01:59,233 --> 01:02:00,402
Where did he go?

747
01:02:00,812 --> 01:02:02,723
He's not here yet, why?

748
01:02:04,493 --> 01:02:05,939
Why are you like this?

749
01:02:07,378 --> 01:02:08,439
Forget it

750
01:02:08,923 --> 01:02:11,010
I'll talk to that punk myself

751
01:02:23,757 --> 01:02:24,790
Eh?

752
01:02:25,263 --> 01:02:26,285
Is he here?

753
01:02:42,077 --> 01:02:43,745
Is he your friend?

754
01:02:45,508 --> 01:02:46,573
That guy?

755
01:03:03,747 --> 01:03:04,868
Jooan

756
01:03:06,915 --> 01:03:07,978
Why?

757
01:03:08,506 --> 01:03:09,735
What happened?

758
01:03:10,895 --> 01:03:12,031
Dogeon...

759
01:03:15,074 --> 01:03:16,319
Haru...

760
01:03:19,379 --> 01:03:20,566
Haru...

761
01:03:21,997 --> 01:03:23,400
Haru seems to be in
a dangerous situation now

762
01:03:25,649 --> 01:03:26,839
Is that your friend?

763
01:03:29,834 --> 01:03:30,857
That one?

764
01:03:31,625 --> 01:03:32,693
Yes

765
01:04:37,338 --> 01:04:47,215
Changjun, don't trust Mr.Koo
He's a bad person
