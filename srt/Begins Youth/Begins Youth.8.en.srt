00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,300
This series is based on a fictionalized story inspired by the story of BTS's album,
The Most Beautiful Moment in Life,
and is not related to BTS members and their families.

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,300
Child actors and animals were filmed
in safe conditions under the supervision of their guardians.

3
00:00:17,873 --> 00:00:19,829
You're protecting me?

4
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:23,292
Piano Academy, 15, 12th road, Kiwa-ro, Songju city

5
00:00:23,751 --> 00:00:25,048
From what?

6
00:00:30,272 --> 00:00:32,565
Can you also protect me

7
00:00:35,476 --> 00:00:36,926
from things that have already happened?

8
00:00:52,501 --> 00:00:53,984
Who are you?

9
00:00:54,801 --> 00:00:56,138
Yes, this is 911

10
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:57,414
How can I help you?

11
00:00:59,336 --> 00:01:00,541
Um... Well...

12
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:12,434
it seems like there will be a fire soon

13
00:01:35,803 --> 00:01:37,166
What should we do about Haru?

14
00:01:40,022 --> 00:01:41,367
Whew, sigh...

15
00:01:42,566 --> 00:01:44,511
You know, since last fall

16
00:01:45,198 --> 00:01:48,517
after the holidays, Haru said he
made a friend at a different school

17
00:01:48,818 --> 00:01:50,677
Why didn't I know that?

18
00:01:50,678 --> 00:01:52,682
Who would've thought that
it's an imaginary friend

19
00:01:53,193 --> 00:01:54,768
So, how is he doing now?

20
00:01:54,769 --> 00:01:57,369
I was so scared and just left him there

21
00:01:57,987 --> 00:01:59,650
What should I do about this, bro?

22
00:01:59,952 --> 00:02:01,120
If he is that bad...

23
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:03,917
it seems like we won't be
able to handle it ourselves...

24
00:02:05,446 --> 00:02:07,691
Don't tell the guys, for now

25
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:12,690
I'll get you some medicine now,
then we should go to the hospital

26
00:02:14,127 --> 00:02:15,906
I'll be there soon so just take it easy

27
00:02:15,907 --> 00:02:17,718
Alright, thanks

28
00:02:23,545 --> 00:02:26,660
We strongly oppose redevelopment

29
00:03:08,419 --> 00:03:10,321
Your fever is so high

30
00:03:11,092 --> 00:03:13,389
Why don't you listen to me
about going to the hospital?

31
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:15,988
I'm fine

32
00:03:18,454 --> 00:03:19,623
I'll lie down for a bit

33
00:03:36,272 --> 00:03:37,514
Go home

34
00:03:38,216 --> 00:03:39,437
Turn off the lights when you leave

35
00:03:41,826 --> 00:03:42,933
Will you really be okay?

36
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:50,118
Ah, I saw several black
cars pass by earlier

37
00:03:50,119 --> 00:03:51,322
What was that?

38
00:03:56,887 --> 00:04:01,049
If the condition gets worse,
call me right away, got it?

39
00:04:02,304 --> 00:04:03,409
Okay

40
00:04:06,438 --> 00:04:07,696
I'm leaving now, okay?

41
00:04:47,033 --> 00:04:50,067
Your friend, that orphan,
he's a complete liar

42
00:04:50,068 --> 00:04:54,353
- What should we do about Haru?
- Everyone moving around makes me feel uneasy

43
00:04:54,354 --> 00:04:56,654
Since your friend's father got elected

44
00:04:56,655 --> 00:04:58,758
they won't go through with
the redevelopment, right?

45
00:05:17,785 --> 00:05:19,671
This area had
the first phase of redevelopment

46
00:05:34,172 --> 00:05:35,538
What's going on,
at this hour of the night?

47
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:40,860
My bicycle's tire is flat

48
00:05:41,652 --> 00:05:43,430
Sorry, I didn't know there were guests...

49
00:05:44,632 --> 00:05:46,332
Ah, a bicycle pump?

50
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:47,547
It should be in the storage

51
00:05:47,548 --> 00:05:48,657
Let's go and have a look

52
00:06:00,857 --> 00:06:02,242
Go home for now

53
00:06:02,858 --> 00:06:05,115
I'll pump your bike's tire and
leave it in front of the apartment

54
00:06:06,405 --> 00:06:07,678
It's because of the redevelopment, right?

55
00:06:14,382 --> 00:06:16,603
Those people came because
of the redevelopment, right?

56
00:06:19,372 --> 00:06:20,503
So what?

57
00:06:21,612 --> 00:06:24,094
Did you think you could stop
what the adults are doing?

58
00:06:27,853 --> 00:06:29,558
What's going to happen will happen anyway

59
00:06:31,696 --> 00:06:32,995
This is not your fault

60
00:06:35,417 --> 00:06:37,426
Just tell your friends earlier

61
00:06:38,225 --> 00:06:39,834
They'll need to prepare
to move out, won't they?

62
00:06:40,342 --> 00:06:41,431
How should I tell them?

63
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,979
My father lied from the beginning

64
00:06:47,804 --> 00:06:51,090
I knew it but didn't dare to say it.
Like this?

65
00:06:51,998 --> 00:06:53,540
When did I tell you to talk like that?

66
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,853
Just say that you didn't know
because of your father

67
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:01,638
Your friends would understand

68
00:07:05,266 --> 00:07:07,370
Would you have done the same
if they were your friends?

69
00:07:07,859 --> 00:07:10,101
Just go for now, later...

70
00:07:11,212 --> 00:07:12,454
later...

71
00:07:22,784 --> 00:07:24,008
Dogeon Kim, open the door!

72
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,119
Hey, Dogeon Kim!

73
00:07:31,268 --> 00:07:33,160
It's me, man, open the door!

74
00:07:36,014 --> 00:07:38,356
Ah, geez, where did this boy go?

75
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,910
Dogeon, are you here?

76
00:07:42,186 --> 00:07:44,795
Ah, this boy is causing trouble again

77
00:07:47,822 --> 00:07:50,486
Is he here or not, hey Dogeon!

78
00:07:51,306 --> 00:07:54,069
Damn, what the!

79
00:08:08,493 --> 00:08:10,653
Geez, opens up so fast

80
00:08:11,101 --> 00:08:12,287
Were you asleep?

81
00:08:17,138 --> 00:08:18,339
Why?

82
00:08:19,539 --> 00:08:20,755
Are you sick?

83
00:08:21,738 --> 00:08:23,955
No, it's just a cold

84
00:08:26,467 --> 00:08:27,840
Sigh...

85
00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:29,312
Hey

86
00:08:30,002 --> 00:08:32,129
You don't have the luxury to be sick

87
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:34,209
Pull yourself together

88
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:36,344
Pull yourself together, alright?

89
00:08:36,345 --> 00:08:37,745
We might have to sell this place

90
00:08:41,337 --> 00:08:42,736
Why do you sell it?

91
00:08:47,136 --> 00:08:48,439
Why sell it...

92
00:08:49,442 --> 00:08:50,915
It's obvious

93
00:08:54,309 --> 00:08:56,599
Before I make any money from this land,

94
00:08:58,011 --> 00:09:00,122
I’ll probably die first due to a stroke

95
00:09:04,486 --> 00:09:06,750
Seeing the underhanded
tactics of those suing me

96
00:09:07,348 --> 00:09:09,049
compensation isn't the issue

97
00:09:11,285 --> 00:09:14,761
Seems like the redevelopment side's goal
is to harass me after taking money

98
00:09:16,391 --> 00:09:18,645
Those who opposed redevelopment

99
00:09:18,646 --> 00:09:21,844
are quietly moving
after receiving extra money

100
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,214
I should

101
00:09:25,792 --> 00:09:30,603
pull myself together, before
I have to sell the land for nothing

102
00:09:31,191 --> 00:09:33,645
and end up in a terrible state, huh?

103
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:36,245
I should pull myself together!

104
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,894
So, you

105
00:09:40,722 --> 00:09:42,201
look for another part time job

106
00:09:43,601 --> 00:09:46,800
And let’s just stay here
until the end of the month

107
00:09:48,802 --> 00:09:51,106
I'm going, sleep well

108
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,284
Hey, this is

109
00:10:24,285 --> 00:10:25,455
for your cold...

110
00:10:26,454 --> 00:10:29,225
Dogeon, Dogeon!

111
00:11:07,991 --> 00:11:09,026
Mom

112
00:11:09,907 --> 00:11:11,493
Oh, you're awake?

113
00:11:14,094 --> 00:11:16,169
Oh, my dear. Can you see me?

114
00:11:17,366 --> 00:11:18,424
What is it?

115
00:11:19,124 --> 00:11:20,517
Why am I in a hospital?

116
00:11:20,518 --> 00:11:23,358
Sigh, you collapsed in the container

117
00:11:23,359 --> 00:11:25,363
Your boss called 911

118
00:11:30,242 --> 00:11:31,641
They said it's Type A flu

119
00:11:32,641 --> 00:11:33,842
They say it's contagious

120
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,642
You need to be isolated
for treatment in a single room

121
00:11:40,022 --> 00:11:42,024
Even the emergency room would be expensive

122
00:11:43,118 --> 00:11:46,128
How much does a day
in this single room cost?

123
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:50,466
I know

124
00:11:51,269 --> 00:11:52,653
I know what you mean

125
00:11:53,652 --> 00:11:54,877
but it's just for today

126
00:11:55,747 --> 00:11:57,214
I'll discharge myself tomorrow

127
00:11:57,514 --> 00:11:58,816
Oh no, you can't!

128
00:11:59,134 --> 00:12:00,596
You're the head of our family

129
00:12:01,296 --> 00:12:02,899
You need to take care of yourself first

130
00:12:11,707 --> 00:12:14,461
Korea Workers' Compensation
and Welfare Service Suncheon Hospital

131
00:12:15,155 --> 00:12:17,994
It's my first time in a single room,
and it's really nice

132
00:12:20,725 --> 00:12:21,940
Hey, Dogeon

133
00:12:22,326 --> 00:12:25,332
You always dreamed of having your own room.
Now it’s like dreams come true, huh?

134
00:12:26,926 --> 00:12:28,036
Just enjoy it

135
00:12:28,538 --> 00:12:31,612
You pay for it anyway so turn on
the TV as much as you want

136
00:12:31,613 --> 00:12:33,611
use the water as much as you can, right?

137
00:12:34,915 --> 00:12:38,607
play with the bed with
this remote control...

138
00:12:38,608 --> 00:12:39,772
- Hey, hey
- Do whatever you want

139
00:12:42,562 --> 00:12:43,763
Sorry

140
00:12:46,424 --> 00:12:48,522
I just can't stand it

141
00:12:49,721 --> 00:12:51,123
Whatever the reason

142
00:12:52,132 --> 00:12:53,726
I can't bear a gloomy atmosphere

143
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,200
Ah, you're struggling
but I'm talking too much

144
00:13:00,408 --> 00:13:01,683
Take it easy, I'll go

145
00:13:05,082 --> 00:13:06,298
Hey, Hosu

146
00:13:10,555 --> 00:13:12,241
My clothes in the closet

147
00:13:14,397 --> 00:13:15,959
Probably in the pocket

148
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,582
Stay there, I'll get it for you

149
00:13:27,566 --> 00:13:28,699
It's medicine

150
00:13:30,276 --> 00:13:31,393
Is it time to take your medicine?

151
00:13:32,425 --> 00:13:33,684
I'll do it for you

152
00:13:35,386 --> 00:13:36,645
That's...

153
00:13:38,644 --> 00:13:39,843
your medicine

154
00:13:42,233 --> 00:13:44,054
What do you mean, my medicine?

155
00:13:53,784 --> 00:13:55,673
Are you really not taking
your medicine and throwing it away?

156
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,156
Really?

157
00:14:02,498 --> 00:14:04,891
What in the world are you saying?

158
00:14:06,108 --> 00:14:07,586
What's wrong with you?

159
00:14:08,486 --> 00:14:09,892
Why would I throw away medicine?

160
00:14:09,893 --> 00:14:11,492
- Hey, that's a bit...
- Dohyun said so

161
00:14:13,492 --> 00:14:15,291
He saw you not taking the
medicine and throwing it away

162
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:27,563
If I say I didn't,

163
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:29,952
will you believe me?

164
00:14:32,156 --> 00:14:33,698
You're already suspecting me, aren't you?

165
00:14:35,105 --> 00:14:36,301
No

166
00:14:37,913 --> 00:14:39,111
You're convinced, aren't you?

167
00:14:41,164 --> 00:14:43,017
- Hosu
- My illness...

168
00:14:44,232 --> 00:14:46,933
It's not like coughing
or lying down like you

169
00:14:47,528 --> 00:14:49,677
- You might think that way
- Hosu Jeong

170
00:14:49,678 --> 00:14:50,877
Oh, I see...

171
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,683
So that's why you kept asking if I'm okay?

172
00:14:57,568 --> 00:14:58,668
Sigh...

173
00:15:00,319 --> 00:15:02,210
I thought you were worried about me

174
00:15:02,665 --> 00:15:03,861
Hey

175
00:15:05,372 --> 00:15:08,274
- Of course, I'm worried, even now
- Hey, Dogeon Kim

176
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,405
I know you're smart

177
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:15,604
I know it very well

178
00:15:17,615 --> 00:15:19,416
But that doesn't mean you
know everything about me

179
00:15:19,906 --> 00:15:22,816
- Hey, Hosu
- Even if it's true

180
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:27,606
I don't think I have to
tell you everything

181
00:15:29,704 --> 00:15:30,817
Bye now

182
00:15:31,719 --> 00:15:32,918
Hosu

183
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:34,607
Hey, Hosu Jeong!

184
00:15:50,471 --> 00:15:53,417
Thanks to Jeha, I managed
to beat Chairman Kim, right?

185
00:15:54,501 --> 00:15:55,805
Lately, Chairman Kim

186
00:15:56,557 --> 00:15:57,941
has been making his son

187
00:15:57,942 --> 00:16:00,376
take intense golf lessons to beat Jeha

188
00:16:02,164 --> 00:16:03,491
That's right

189
00:16:03,492 --> 00:16:07,428
This was only the third time Jeha
went out with his dad, wasn't it?

190
00:16:08,226 --> 00:16:11,524
I just think I was a bit lucky

191
00:16:12,949 --> 00:16:14,084
Well

192
00:16:14,944 --> 00:16:18,904
it seems like your studies aren’t going so well,
maybe try focusing on golf instead

193
00:16:18,905 --> 00:16:20,268
Mingook

194
00:16:20,269 --> 00:16:22,356
Jeha has improved his grades recently

195
00:16:22,357 --> 00:16:24,917
He's been reducing his
gaming and studying hard

196
00:16:25,216 --> 00:16:26,491
That's what you think

197
00:16:27,182 --> 00:16:29,168
They say brain is from their parents

198
00:16:32,827 --> 00:16:35,197
- Would you like some scorched rice water?
- Sure

199
00:16:42,551 --> 00:16:43,737
Hey

200
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:46,464
You said you weren’t
hanging out with Cein Min

201
00:16:46,465 --> 00:16:49,478
but a few days ago,
you sneaked out at dawn?

202
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:52,691
- What?
- You and Cein

203
00:16:52,692 --> 00:16:55,770
talked about the key over the phone, and then
you went out and came back in the early morning

204
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:57,754
I heard everything

205
00:17:00,432 --> 00:17:06,735
As your brother, I'm really worried about
you hanging out with that murderer...

206
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:11,307
- Jeha, you...
- That's not true

207
00:17:12,705 --> 00:17:14,239
Are you sure you weren't dreaming?

208
00:17:15,046 --> 00:17:17,039
What are you talking about? Hey

209
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:19,413
- That day in the cafeteria...
- Yeah

210
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:22,904
the day you told me to put your lunch
tray down for you in the cafeteria

211
00:17:24,106 --> 00:17:25,271
You said

212
00:17:25,867 --> 00:17:28,035
Why would high schoolers
hang out with middle schoolers?

213
00:17:30,538 --> 00:17:32,734
Right, they don’t hang out with me

214
00:17:33,556 --> 00:17:36,736
Mingook, do you make your
brother do such things at school?

215
00:17:37,738 --> 00:17:38,959
No, I don't

216
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,958
- Only that day...
- Just answer whether you did or didn’t!

217
00:17:43,761 --> 00:17:46,360
We're not talking about that right now!

218
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:48,519
Mingook

219
00:17:49,606 --> 00:17:54,403
I sent Jeha to the same
school as you on purpose

220
00:17:55,003 --> 00:17:57,404
hoping you would take good care of him

221
00:17:58,905 --> 00:18:00,921
Have you been acting like that all along?

222
00:18:00,922 --> 00:18:03,521
Auntie, please stay out of it

223
00:18:03,522 --> 00:18:06,926
And I’ve seen your son
continuing to hang out

224
00:18:07,321 --> 00:18:09,222
with Cein Min

225
00:18:09,223 --> 00:18:11,419
Mingook Seo! What?

226
00:18:12,521 --> 00:18:13,715
Auntie?

227
00:18:14,115 --> 00:18:15,426
You?

228
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:17,223
How dare you...

229
00:18:18,502 --> 00:18:20,899
It's been over three years now, right?

230
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,569
Whether you accept it or not

231
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:24,753
living in the same house and sharing meals

232
00:18:24,754 --> 00:18:26,753
make us a family

233
00:18:28,435 --> 00:18:31,535
You’re the older brother,
but still act like a child

234
00:18:33,047 --> 00:18:35,496
if you can’t accept my way,
then you should leave

235
00:18:36,285 --> 00:18:37,494
That’s what you should do

236
00:18:40,636 --> 00:18:42,530
I understand how Mingook feels

237
00:18:43,298 --> 00:18:44,872
Please don’t get angry, honey

238
00:18:45,682 --> 00:18:48,187
If I want to be called Mom,
I should work harder

239
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,340
It’s not Mingook's fault

240
00:18:52,892 --> 00:18:54,290
I warned you clearly

241
00:18:56,241 --> 00:18:57,445
Mingook Seo

242
00:18:58,445 --> 00:18:59,647
Answer me

243
00:19:04,516 --> 00:19:05,728
Yes

244
00:19:09,989 --> 00:19:12,286
- Thanks for the meal
- Sit down

245
00:19:13,775 --> 00:19:15,051
Eat

246
00:19:16,991 --> 00:19:18,190
Yes

247
00:19:33,931 --> 00:19:36,440
You barely ate earlier, right?

248
00:19:36,933 --> 00:19:39,510
You must be hungry,
at least have this before you go

249
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:41,157
No, I'm fine

250
00:19:42,091 --> 00:19:45,920
I noticed you've been losing your
appetite and looking tired lately

251
00:19:45,921 --> 00:19:47,848
so I made this with
bananas and blueberries...

252
00:20:07,348 --> 00:20:09,190
Why bother pretending to be a family?

253
00:20:10,222 --> 00:20:11,540
It's pointless

254
00:20:14,829 --> 00:20:15,937
Alright

255
00:20:17,329 --> 00:20:20,928
Mingook, it’s okay for you
to treat me any way you want

256
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:23,568
but Jeha

257
00:20:26,152 --> 00:20:27,544
is your brother

258
00:20:29,142 --> 00:20:30,344
Who is?

259
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:34,109
Him?

260
00:20:35,908 --> 00:20:38,308
He doesn't consider me his brother either

261
00:20:39,987 --> 00:20:43,498
and you don't think of me as your son

262
00:20:46,141 --> 00:20:47,538
I’m aware of that

263
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,139
Maybe not as much as your real son

264
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:23,720
Can we really become a family

265
00:21:24,837 --> 00:21:26,207
all of a sudden?

266
00:21:47,613 --> 00:21:48,736
Jooan Kim

267
00:21:49,739 --> 00:21:51,252
Jooan

268
00:21:55,517 --> 00:21:56,795
What the...

269
00:21:59,242 --> 00:22:02,030
Jooan, you just left
like that yesterday...

270
00:22:06,073 --> 00:22:07,474
Why, are you hurt?

271
00:22:10,533 --> 00:22:12,045
Take care of yourself first

272
00:22:12,745 --> 00:22:14,653
Okay? Will you?

273
00:22:16,258 --> 00:22:18,602
Hey, what's with you lately...

274
00:22:20,143 --> 00:22:22,144
Did I do something wrong to you?

275
00:22:28,738 --> 00:22:30,488
If it's because of my friend,

276
00:22:32,173 --> 00:22:33,459
he's really a good guy

277
00:22:33,954 --> 00:22:36,264
- So, if you meet him and talk...
- Hey

278
00:22:37,642 --> 00:22:38,843
Just go away, seriously

279
00:22:40,218 --> 00:22:41,408
Get lost!

280
00:22:48,152 --> 00:22:49,851
Shouldn't we visit Dogeon in the hospital?

281
00:22:50,751 --> 00:22:51,811
That's what I thought

282
00:22:52,202 --> 00:22:53,921
- Yeah, I want to go
- Oh, wait!

283
00:22:57,064 --> 00:22:59,042
Maybe it's better not to go for a while

284
00:23:00,614 --> 00:23:03,043
It's a contagious disease,
so he’s in a private room

285
00:23:03,044 --> 00:23:04,619
It might be better for us not to visit

286
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,243
- Did you go?
- Yeah

287
00:23:07,994 --> 00:23:09,226
I went because of Dohyeon

288
00:23:09,924 --> 00:23:12,032
it's a bit tricky if that’s the case

289
00:23:12,728 --> 00:23:14,630
We’ll have to see him
after he's discharged

290
00:23:16,938 --> 00:23:18,183
Hey, Hosu

291
00:23:19,078 --> 00:23:20,203
Uh? Jeongmin!

292
00:23:20,204 --> 00:23:22,107
Why haven't you been in touch lately?

293
00:23:22,108 --> 00:23:23,312
You haven't either

294
00:23:23,723 --> 00:23:25,219
Hey, I'm transferring
to a different school

295
00:23:25,652 --> 00:23:26,699
Transferring?

296
00:23:27,792 --> 00:23:30,585
- You too?
- Moving to Munhyeon-si because of redevelopment?

297
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:32,212
I don't know

298
00:23:32,213 --> 00:23:33,656
I'll message you,
let's keep in touch

299
00:23:33,657 --> 00:23:35,045
Uh, hey, I'll really keep in touch

300
00:23:37,793 --> 00:23:40,125
Why is everyone moving?

301
00:23:40,126 --> 00:23:41,733
They’re not going to do
the redevelopment anyway...

302
00:23:42,527 --> 00:23:43,707
Isn't it, Hwan?

303
00:23:47,693 --> 00:23:48,886
I'm not sure

304
00:23:52,933 --> 00:23:54,199
Your father

305
00:23:55,596 --> 00:23:57,992
- Legislator Changjun Kim...
- Yes, it was

306
00:23:59,487 --> 00:24:01,625
Because it's my father's business,
so I don't really know much

307
00:24:09,034 --> 00:24:10,367
I'll go first

308
00:24:10,668 --> 00:24:12,117
I forgot about the homework
for the next class

309
00:24:35,201 --> 00:24:37,013
Sorry, I couldn't give it to you earlier

310
00:24:46,811 --> 00:24:48,059
My father

311
00:24:48,866 --> 00:24:50,022
and your mother

312
00:24:52,139 --> 00:24:53,783
seem to have liked each other

313
00:25:10,672 --> 00:25:11,958
Then, maybe

314
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:16,370
that's why you were
at the hideout that time...

315
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:34,217
Because of this last thing

316
00:25:40,016 --> 00:25:41,194
But now that I see this,

317
00:25:42,893 --> 00:25:44,515
maybe my father's love

318
00:25:45,915 --> 00:25:48,406
was only for your mother, I guess

319
00:25:51,694 --> 00:25:53,002
So then, I was really

320
00:25:56,011 --> 00:25:57,529
born between a father who
couldn't forget his first love

321
00:25:59,623 --> 00:26:03,212
and a mother who never
loved such a husband

322
00:26:07,124 --> 00:26:08,294
I'm just

323
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:11,145
like a contract

324
00:26:13,955 --> 00:26:15,247
Every time they see me,

325
00:26:17,526 --> 00:26:19,763
it reminds their marital relationship

326
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:24,988
and emphasizes only duty

327
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,539
It was hard to accept

328
00:26:34,303 --> 00:26:35,658
Even though I knew it wasn't

329
00:26:42,091 --> 00:26:43,228
Maybe...

330
00:26:44,832 --> 00:26:48,426
There could be something
in that hidden note to save me

331
00:26:49,529 --> 00:26:50,774
I hoped that

332
00:27:06,903 --> 00:27:09,125
That note...

333
00:27:12,387 --> 00:27:13,785
I found it

334
00:27:14,469 --> 00:27:15,955
in that piano

335
00:27:16,961 --> 00:27:18,154
in a way only mom

336
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:23,016
and I know

337
00:27:26,506 --> 00:27:27,749
Maybe not

338
00:27:28,534 --> 00:27:29,945
Perhaps that way

339
00:27:31,234 --> 00:27:33,944
started from your father's time

340
00:27:36,335 --> 00:27:38,146
What was written in it?

341
00:27:40,148 --> 00:27:41,334
Be careful of...

342
00:27:46,933 --> 00:27:48,108
the principal

343
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:51,692
He's a bad person

344
00:27:59,892 --> 00:28:01,021
Hwan

345
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,941
please tell me everything

346
00:28:06,043 --> 00:28:07,751
If we can't solve it,

347
00:28:08,567 --> 00:28:11,151
- ask your father, or if not, police...
- No

348
00:28:11,853 --> 00:28:13,531
He's a good person, the principal

349
00:28:16,423 --> 00:28:17,659
at least to me

350
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:24,320
I don't know how he was to my father

351
00:28:44,418 --> 00:28:46,479
- Be careful with your hands
- Yes

352
00:28:50,012 --> 00:28:53,920
For hammering, just tap
gently, no need to hit hard

353
00:28:54,404 --> 00:28:56,446
Level, level...

354
00:28:58,651 --> 00:29:00,429
Yes, that's good enough

355
00:29:03,925 --> 00:29:05,145
Brick, please

356
00:29:07,256 --> 00:29:08,507
Hosu?

357
00:29:09,197 --> 00:29:12,001
- Brick
- Oh, sorry

358
00:29:15,913 --> 00:29:32,955
We must survive!

359
00:29:36,446 --> 00:29:37,726
Dogeon, are you okay?

360
00:30:00,063 --> 00:30:02,712
You don't seem fully recovered,
why don't you stay in the hospital a bit longer

361
00:30:02,713 --> 00:30:05,712
Hey, single rooms are too expensive

362
00:30:10,143 --> 00:30:12,222
Just be cautious with contact

363
00:30:12,923 --> 00:30:15,167
and it should be okay in a few days

364
00:30:16,394 --> 00:30:18,791
I feel more comfortable here, actually

365
00:30:32,838 --> 00:30:35,255
I know it's odd to say
this when you're sick

366
00:30:38,478 --> 00:30:39,674
but this seems better for me

367
00:30:54,712 --> 00:30:57,019
To be honest, I just couldn't
face you and say this

368
00:31:07,316 --> 00:31:08,547
I'm sorry

369
00:31:11,735 --> 00:31:13,137
Dohyeon is right

370
00:31:15,882 --> 00:31:17,022
That's my medicine

371
00:31:18,464 --> 00:31:19,673
I threw it away

372
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:28,450
That unbearable narcolepsy...

373
00:31:31,351 --> 00:31:34,273
But, when they said it's getting
better, I strangely got scared

374
00:31:36,375 --> 00:31:37,974
If even this illness goes away

375
00:31:41,117 --> 00:31:43,016
no one would care about me anymore

376
00:31:47,002 --> 00:31:49,113
just like the day I first
arrived at the orphanage

377
00:31:59,363 --> 00:32:02,169
With mom, I was always called 'our Hosu'

378
00:32:02,668 --> 00:32:04,172
Child Takeover Certificate
'our son'

379
00:32:06,464 --> 00:32:08,465
but there, just Hosu, Hosu Jeong

380
00:32:11,166 --> 00:32:12,719
just one of the many kids

381
00:32:14,218 --> 00:32:17,676
You know, like those idol
audition shows these days

382
00:32:17,677 --> 00:32:18,872
Something like that

383
00:32:19,973 --> 00:32:21,871
Maybe I've had an attention
seeking trait since then

384
00:32:23,623 --> 00:32:24,895
I couldn't stand that

385
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:28,411
no one cares about me

386
00:32:30,788 --> 00:32:32,079
So I left

387
00:32:34,333 --> 00:32:36,121
I ran away at just five

388
00:32:41,046 --> 00:32:42,749
I even caught a fever

389
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:45,181
my vision was getting blurry

390
00:32:49,344 --> 00:32:50,995
and I thought I saw someone in front of me

391
00:32:54,703 --> 00:32:58,006
I called for Mom with the
loudest voice I could make

392
00:32:58,503 --> 00:32:59,779
Mom!

393
00:33:00,771 --> 00:33:01,969
Mom!

394
00:33:03,073 --> 00:33:04,858
Mom shouldn't lose me again

395
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,196
Mom!

396
00:33:07,927 --> 00:33:09,182
Mom!

397
00:33:10,585 --> 00:33:11,792
Mom!

398
00:33:13,787 --> 00:33:15,045
Mom

399
00:33:15,445 --> 00:33:19,041
Mom, mom!

400
00:33:23,181 --> 00:33:26,807
Mom

401
00:33:27,522 --> 00:33:29,071
Mom

402
00:33:31,804 --> 00:33:32,946
Mom

403
00:33:42,867 --> 00:33:43,992
Are you okay?

404
00:33:45,096 --> 00:33:46,209
Mom

405
00:33:47,114 --> 00:33:48,198
Hey, kiddo

406
00:33:48,518 --> 00:33:49,555
Hey

407
00:33:50,761 --> 00:33:52,202
- Kiddo?
- Wake up, kiddo

408
00:33:52,502 --> 00:33:53,608
Come on, wake up

409
00:33:54,069 --> 00:33:55,584
Mom

410
00:33:55,881 --> 00:33:57,025
Hosu

411
00:34:00,216 --> 00:34:02,304
Hosu? Hosu!

412
00:34:04,502 --> 00:34:07,541
Since that day, I was classified as a
'child of interest' at the orphanage

413
00:34:08,942 --> 00:34:10,679
But you know, it wasn't so bad

414
00:34:13,666 --> 00:34:15,254
Everyone thought I was sick and weak

415
00:34:16,547 --> 00:34:18,851
so they paid attention to me

416
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:22,681
I liked it

417
00:34:25,777 --> 00:34:27,576
All those eyes on me

418
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:29,955
That feeling of being seen

419
00:34:32,692 --> 00:34:34,975
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine

420
00:34:35,275 --> 00:34:37,420
- I'm fine
- You fainted again, did you get hurt?

421
00:34:38,434 --> 00:34:40,393
When I collapsed,
everyone only looked at me

422
00:34:41,201 --> 00:34:43,300
Whether it was concern or pity

423
00:34:44,792 --> 00:34:46,001
it didn't matter

424
00:34:49,192 --> 00:34:51,409
From then on, in similar situations

425
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:54,105
I would just collapse
as if falling into sleep

426
00:34:56,018 --> 00:34:58,038
It felt like I've got a weapon

427
00:34:59,346 --> 00:35:00,964
My only weapon

428
00:35:02,462 --> 00:35:05,805
A surefire way
to beg for attention, you know?

429
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:10,197
Ah, it sounds so pathetic
the more I talk about it

430
00:35:13,026 --> 00:35:14,635
But then one day

431
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:18,871
I noticed that this weapon had disappeared

432
00:35:20,274 --> 00:35:21,447
Then what?

433
00:35:25,816 --> 00:35:27,222
I threw away the medicine

434
00:35:28,892 --> 00:35:31,595
Since then, I started faking
narcolepsy symptoms,

435
00:35:34,948 --> 00:35:36,748
creating wounds where there were none,

436
00:35:40,546 --> 00:35:43,461
moving hospitals if I was
about to get caught,

437
00:35:43,946 --> 00:35:45,246
and changing doctors

438
00:35:51,063 --> 00:35:52,224
Pretty awful, right?

439
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,785
Yeah

440
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:00,369
Hey, even if you hate me for this

441
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:03,372
I totally get it

442
00:36:07,122 --> 00:36:08,242
I...

443
00:36:11,174 --> 00:36:13,188
have never imagined your life

444
00:36:17,169 --> 00:36:18,884
I can't even imagine it

445
00:36:20,073 --> 00:36:21,269
It's too scary

446
00:36:24,174 --> 00:36:26,884
So I don't even know
what to say to you right now

447
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:31,930
But you know

448
00:36:34,777 --> 00:36:36,364
you haven't done anything wrong

449
00:36:40,155 --> 00:36:41,954
Anyway, the five-year-old Hosu Jeong

450
00:36:43,155 --> 00:36:44,755
survived until now

451
00:36:46,785 --> 00:36:47,899
With that 'weapon'

452
00:36:51,597 --> 00:36:53,902
Unless someone has lived your life

453
00:36:55,096 --> 00:36:56,899
no one has the right
to say anything about it

454
00:36:59,429 --> 00:37:01,028
Whether you survive like a cockroach

455
00:37:04,545 --> 00:37:06,210
or like an emperor

456
00:37:08,777 --> 00:37:10,881
only those who've lived the same life

457
00:37:13,753 --> 00:37:15,741
have the right to judge it

458
00:37:22,872 --> 00:37:24,285
We have to survive

459
00:37:26,802 --> 00:37:28,017
endure

460
00:37:30,406 --> 00:37:31,620
so...

461
00:37:38,992 --> 00:37:40,171
I'm sorry

462
00:37:41,236 --> 00:37:43,039
I did fly into a temper a bit

463
00:37:44,238 --> 00:37:45,265
No

464
00:37:46,233 --> 00:37:47,329
No

465
00:37:50,022 --> 00:37:51,109
Yeah, endurance

466
00:37:53,942 --> 00:37:56,279
Enduring is kind of
our specialty, isn't it?

467
00:38:00,701 --> 00:38:03,017
Hey, but talking without seeing your face,

468
00:38:04,033 --> 00:38:05,216
it's like

469
00:38:06,315 --> 00:38:08,615
what do you call it,
in church with the priest...

470
00:38:09,238 --> 00:38:12,404
Oh, confession?

471
00:38:12,996 --> 00:38:14,661
Yeah, that one

472
00:38:16,219 --> 00:38:17,422
It feels like that

473
00:38:18,725 --> 00:38:21,504
'I absolve you of your sins'

474
00:38:26,418 --> 00:38:27,915
You're crazy

475
00:38:34,935 --> 00:38:36,220
Isn't this how you do it?

476
00:38:41,333 --> 00:38:43,317
If only I had experienced confession...

477
00:39:05,818 --> 00:39:08,068
I heard about it on my
way back from the laundry

478
00:39:08,069 --> 00:39:10,672
They say there was a fire at a seafood
restaurant by the beach at dawn

479
00:39:11,069 --> 00:39:15,836
Before that, the container site owner
crashed into a breaker or something,

480
00:39:16,136 --> 00:39:17,774
killing all the seafood

481
00:39:18,974 --> 00:39:20,434
Is the restaurant owner
cursed or something?

482
00:39:20,435 --> 00:39:22,269
There's been no end to accidents, right?

483
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:24,951
Since last year, bodies have
been turning up at the beach

484
00:39:25,251 --> 00:39:26,468
power outages, and fires...

485
00:39:27,751 --> 00:39:29,145
They need to redevelop that area

486
00:39:29,146 --> 00:39:30,761
It's Cein Min again, isn't it?

487
00:39:32,137 --> 00:39:33,277
When there's a fire...

488
00:39:33,978 --> 00:39:35,701
- Is it always Cein?
- Why?

489
00:39:36,293 --> 00:39:38,092
Cein always carries a lighter around

490
00:39:39,197 --> 00:39:44,288
- Are you taking his side again?
- Anyway, avoid beaches or quiet places

491
00:39:44,672 --> 00:39:47,668
Come straight home after school, got it?

492
00:39:48,267 --> 00:39:49,329
Yes

493
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:50,447
Yes

494
00:39:59,694 --> 00:40:00,939
Cein,

495
00:40:01,637 --> 00:40:03,246
why did you go to the beach yesterday?

496
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:05,624
I have no reason

497
00:40:09,421 --> 00:40:12,619
You had an argument with the owner
of that seafood place, right?

498
00:40:13,818 --> 00:40:15,791
According to the car's dash cam

499
00:40:20,908 --> 00:40:23,206
It wasn't an argument,
I was just on the receiving end

500
00:40:24,313 --> 00:40:26,165
The lady was going at me

501
00:40:27,564 --> 00:40:30,566
saying I was up to no good,
causing trouble

502
00:40:33,874 --> 00:40:35,575
and even brought up my mom

503
00:40:35,576 --> 00:40:39,068
Whew, why do you come
and go like this, huh?

504
00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:41,466
Kids should go straight home after school

505
00:40:44,171 --> 00:40:45,352
What's that in your hand?

506
00:40:45,353 --> 00:40:46,766
A lighter?

507
00:40:46,767 --> 00:40:48,910
Students should be carrying pencils

508
00:40:48,911 --> 00:40:50,771
not lighters!

509
00:40:50,772 --> 00:40:51,839
That's dangerous

510
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:53,427
It's not for playing with fire

511
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:55,111
It's just

512
00:40:56,112 --> 00:40:57,371
something I carry around

513
00:40:57,771 --> 00:40:59,975
Why do you carry that? It's dangerous

514
00:41:00,888 --> 00:41:02,531
Oh, dear

515
00:41:03,431 --> 00:41:05,941
Hey, was it you
who started the fire at your house?

516
00:41:08,431 --> 00:41:10,738
- Did her mentioning your mom upset you?
- No

517
00:41:13,009 --> 00:41:15,134
Wasn't the actual person who started
the fire caught on this car's dash cam?

518
00:41:15,729 --> 00:41:18,797
The owner left right after Cein, so...

519
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:23,178
The security camera around the beach
was broken yesterday

520
00:41:23,677 --> 00:41:24,951
Did you know that?

521
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:27,548
How would I know?

522
00:41:28,266 --> 00:41:30,348
Then around 3 a.m. yesterday,

523
00:41:31,859 --> 00:41:33,062
what did you do?

524
00:41:37,914 --> 00:41:39,335
I was at home

525
00:41:39,336 --> 00:41:40,947
Really?

526
00:41:42,602 --> 00:41:44,578
I checked the apartment's security camera

527
00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:46,785
You left yesterday morning and

528
00:41:48,884 --> 00:41:50,397
didn't come back until dawn, right?

529
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:53,539
You don't believe me anyway

530
00:41:54,726 --> 00:41:57,449
- No matter what I say
- Ahh, this is so frustrating!

531
00:41:58,061 --> 00:42:01,137
All that mattered was that he wasn't
at the beach when the fire happened!

532
00:42:01,843 --> 00:42:03,607
But why doesn't he talk?

533
00:42:04,002 --> 00:42:07,173
So, if Cein wasn't there
around 3 a.m. when the fire broke out,

534
00:42:07,174 --> 00:42:09,601
isn't that enough to prove his innocence?

535
00:42:10,139 --> 00:42:12,737
Uh, that 'Alibaba' thing

536
00:42:14,455 --> 00:42:16,731
Since Cein's dad is only home on weekends

537
00:42:17,218 --> 00:42:18,682
there's no one to vouch for him

538
00:42:19,202 --> 00:42:21,937
Ah, damn, Cein wasn't there at that time...

539
00:42:23,667 --> 00:42:25,913
Seriously, it's not Cein, damn it

540
00:42:27,108 --> 00:42:29,704
But how do you know?

541
00:42:29,705 --> 00:42:31,705
- That Cein wasn't there
- Well...

542
00:42:34,105 --> 00:42:35,870
Sigh, seriously...

543
00:42:53,283 --> 00:42:55,792
Cein, you weren't at the beach
yesterday at that time

544
00:43:00,093 --> 00:43:02,592
Let me go, I'm taking my son with me

545
00:43:02,593 --> 00:43:03,771
You can't just barge in here

546
00:43:05,764 --> 00:43:07,376
Why are you here during class time?

547
00:43:11,569 --> 00:43:13,816
Do you have evidence? A witness?

548
00:43:14,309 --> 00:43:15,731
Someone said my son did it?

549
00:43:15,732 --> 00:43:18,134
- No, we're just investigating...
- He is a minor!

550
00:43:18,828 --> 00:43:20,322
Are you interrogating him
without consent from his parents?

551
00:43:21,319 --> 00:43:23,097
Cein Min, get up

552
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:27,400
What are you doing?
You don't need to be like this

553
00:43:28,599 --> 00:43:30,605
- Get up
- Excuse me, sir

554
00:43:31,201 --> 00:43:33,002
you might be shocked but

555
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:36,607
- this investigation is under our protection...
- Is this how the school

556
00:43:38,005 --> 00:43:39,401
protects its students?

557
00:43:40,199 --> 00:43:41,395
Let's go

558
00:43:48,184 --> 00:43:49,380
Eat it

559
00:43:58,385 --> 00:44:00,008
You must have missed lunch

560
00:44:03,363 --> 00:44:04,565
I'm sorry

561
00:44:07,291 --> 00:44:09,479
- Cein
- Yes

562
00:44:11,443 --> 00:44:12,656
Cein Min

563
00:44:14,217 --> 00:44:15,415
Yes

564
00:44:19,697 --> 00:44:21,196
Should we move to another town?

565
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:24,578
Or even to another city?

566
00:44:26,143 --> 00:44:27,142
Then

567
00:44:29,084 --> 00:44:32,584
you won't have to suffer
these unjust suspicions

568
00:44:35,849 --> 00:44:37,246
Even if you say it's okay,

569
00:44:39,673 --> 00:44:41,043
as a father, it makes me angry

570
00:44:44,427 --> 00:44:45,848
to see my son go through this

571
00:44:47,812 --> 00:44:49,171
Not just once or twice

572
00:44:50,829 --> 00:44:52,933
Every time something happens
in the neighborhood

573
00:44:54,203 --> 00:44:55,506
they treat you like a scapegoat

574
00:44:56,691 --> 00:44:57,761
I'm

575
00:45:00,106 --> 00:45:01,107
fine

576
00:45:02,446 --> 00:45:03,948
And I like it here

577
00:45:05,459 --> 00:45:06,646
Where I lived with mom

578
00:45:08,984 --> 00:45:10,794
Someday, when this place is redeveloped

579
00:45:12,283 --> 00:45:13,587
our old house will

580
00:45:16,153 --> 00:45:17,343
disappear too...

581
00:45:19,948 --> 00:45:21,094
That house...

582
00:45:26,564 --> 00:45:27,897
disappeared

583
00:45:30,661 --> 00:45:32,056
the day your mother died

584
00:45:37,691 --> 00:45:43,269
Songjoo Police Station

585
00:46:06,035 --> 00:46:09,099
Hey, what's this location tracking, huh?

586
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:11,531
Are you two dating?

587
00:46:11,834 --> 00:46:13,661
Not hanging out? What a joke

588
00:46:13,662 --> 00:46:16,916
He installed it as a joke

589
00:46:16,917 --> 00:46:18,659
and just forgot to delete it

590
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:22,670
Since Cein seemed to be misunderstood,

591
00:46:23,259 --> 00:46:27,048
he felt sorry for him and
went to the police to explain

592
00:46:27,748 --> 00:46:30,900
- Jeha has always been so delicate...
- Jeha Jeon

593
00:46:33,816 --> 00:46:35,538
Are you going to disappoint
your father like this?

594
00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:39,540
I thought you were studying
hard and behaving well

595
00:46:39,541 --> 00:46:42,138
but you're still hanging out
with that kind of kid and lying!

596
00:46:48,469 --> 00:46:49,843
You're going golfing right away?

597
00:46:50,335 --> 00:46:53,245
- Jeha, what are you doing? Get ready
- Jeha is staying home today

598
00:46:54,952 --> 00:46:56,809
Mingook Seo, get ready now

599
00:46:57,408 --> 00:46:58,510
Yes, sir

600
00:47:36,284 --> 00:47:38,518
Delete that location tracker right now

601
00:47:38,519 --> 00:47:39,918
It's creepy

602
00:47:55,861 --> 00:48:00,196
The call could not be connected.
After the beep...

603
00:48:07,504 --> 00:48:08,881
The call could not be connected...

604
00:48:13,431 --> 00:48:14,983
Jooan seems still mad

605
00:48:17,208 --> 00:48:19,113
I'm still worried about Cein's situation

606
00:48:22,114 --> 00:48:24,499
I wish there was something I could do...

607
00:48:28,129 --> 00:48:29,233
No

608
00:48:30,227 --> 00:48:31,833
I really hate myself

609
00:48:35,157 --> 00:48:36,399
Don't blame yourself

610
00:48:36,913 --> 00:48:38,121
Haru, you're a good kid

611
00:48:38,922 --> 00:48:41,722
You're too kind, thinking
everything is your fault, right?

612
00:48:43,314 --> 00:48:44,713
I'm not kind

613
00:48:46,085 --> 00:48:47,188
Not at all

614
00:48:47,744 --> 00:48:49,044
I've always said

615
00:48:49,442 --> 00:48:51,041
it's for protecting yourself

616
00:48:51,641 --> 00:48:53,641
to avoid getting hurt anymore

617
00:48:54,057 --> 00:48:55,843
to stop hiding

618
00:48:56,144 --> 00:48:57,376
Is that bad?

619
00:48:59,375 --> 00:49:00,472
No

620
00:49:01,664 --> 00:49:02,889
No

621
00:49:08,241 --> 00:49:09,440
it's not bad

622
00:49:29,419 --> 00:49:32,620
Notice of Hideout Closure

623
00:50:20,565 --> 00:50:22,858
- Did you call for me?
- Yes

624
00:50:23,775 --> 00:50:27,656
I was just wondering
if you're ready for the midterm

625
00:50:28,947 --> 00:50:31,146
You'll do well this time too, right?

626
00:50:33,627 --> 00:50:37,831
Oh, it's good that Cein has
been cleared of arson charges

627
00:50:38,433 --> 00:50:41,039
According to what Jeha Jeon
said at the police station

628
00:50:41,729 --> 00:50:44,029
he was really at school at that time

629
00:50:45,228 --> 00:50:47,042
The security camera showed him

630
00:50:48,028 --> 00:50:49,832
heading towards the
abandoned school building

631
00:50:50,831 --> 00:50:54,230
What does Cein really want, I wonder?

632
00:50:57,437 --> 00:50:58,618
By the way, Hwan

633
00:50:59,718 --> 00:51:00,876
be careful of the principal

634
00:51:02,634 --> 00:51:03,830
He seems like a bad person

635
00:51:07,125 --> 00:51:08,432
What

636
00:51:11,877 --> 00:51:13,245
do you want, sir?

637
00:51:37,402 --> 00:51:38,460
Cein

638
00:51:39,213 --> 00:51:40,553
I'm really sorry

639
00:51:43,077 --> 00:51:44,477
I deleted the app

640
00:51:46,073 --> 00:51:47,196
look

641
00:51:51,395 --> 00:51:52,938
I'm so sorry

642
00:51:53,636 --> 00:51:54,776
I really messed up

643
00:51:56,195 --> 00:51:57,647
Just forgive me this once, okay?

644
00:52:06,525 --> 00:52:07,747
You're not leaving?

645
00:52:08,849 --> 00:52:10,257
Then I'll leave

646
00:52:11,910 --> 00:52:14,103
Bro, please...

647
00:52:15,587 --> 00:52:17,997
- If you just give me one more chance...
- Won't you move?

648
00:52:18,792 --> 00:52:19,998
What chance?

649
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:21,753
It's all over, thanks to you

650
00:52:23,945 --> 00:52:26,339
Because you said I was at school that time

651
00:52:29,976 --> 00:52:31,196
That was...

652
00:52:34,124 --> 00:52:35,723
because I was worried
you were under suspicion

653
00:52:38,648 --> 00:52:41,849
- I was just worried...
- I never asked you to worry about me

654
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:45,048
Don't worry about me from now on,
I won't worry about you either

655
00:52:52,407 --> 00:52:55,416
Whether you jump off a building or get hit
by a car, do as you please from now on

656
00:53:01,177 --> 00:53:02,382
Cein!

657
00:53:07,312 --> 00:53:09,344
It's not like you got
rejected in a love confession

658
00:53:09,345 --> 00:53:10,572
Why is he acting like that? Bastard...

659
00:53:11,002 --> 00:53:15,017
Hey, don't call my brother a bastard

660
00:53:15,995 --> 00:53:18,292
- What is it?
- My brother?

661
00:53:18,787 --> 00:53:20,283
Hey, you're not in character today

662
00:53:21,287 --> 00:53:22,474
What?

663
00:53:23,063 --> 00:53:24,666
It's because... the auntie
told me to be nice to him

664
00:53:26,127 --> 00:53:28,946
Hey, isn't it cute that my
brother is looking for them?

665
00:53:28,947 --> 00:53:30,210
No way

666
00:53:32,226 --> 00:53:34,520
Hey, do you guys have time today?

667
00:53:34,921 --> 00:53:37,078
- Hey, dude
- What?

668
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:49,863
You are really fearless, aren't you, Cein?

669
00:53:53,061 --> 00:53:58,071
Going into that abandoned
school building alone that night

670
00:53:59,459 --> 00:54:02,461
I know there's a ghost story
related to that place

671
00:54:03,774 --> 00:54:05,459
About a woman ghost who
suffered from severe depression

672
00:54:06,346 --> 00:54:08,515
abandoned her husband and child

673
00:54:08,516 --> 00:54:11,644
selfishly committed suicide alone

674
00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:16,925
She was more attached to
her high school crush

675
00:54:17,827 --> 00:54:20,830
than her husband or child

676
00:54:21,350 --> 00:54:23,031
I know it's all lies

677
00:54:24,936 --> 00:54:26,632
The truth about your mom's suicide

678
00:54:27,433 --> 00:54:30,032
disappeared in the fire that day

679
00:54:30,531 --> 00:54:32,230
The choice was your mom's

680
00:54:33,231 --> 00:54:35,432
and there is nothing you can do, Cein Min

681
00:54:36,830 --> 00:54:38,035
What you did...

682
00:54:39,630 --> 00:54:41,143
I'll uncover everything

683
00:54:44,414 --> 00:54:47,014
Sure, do what you want

684
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:49,725
But

685
00:54:50,233 --> 00:54:54,126
it won't bring your mom back to life

686
00:54:55,032 --> 00:54:58,926
Eunjoo was always severely depressed

687
00:55:00,228 --> 00:55:03,137
Everyone kept quiet because she's dead

688
00:55:03,938 --> 00:55:06,129
Your mom's mom was known

689
00:55:06,130 --> 00:55:08,527
- for her scandalous behavior
- Shut up!

690
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:15,879
And will anyone believe the words from

691
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:18,283
a troublemaker like you?

692
00:55:19,329 --> 00:55:23,232
If you wanted to reveal that,

693
00:55:23,931 --> 00:55:26,291
you should have lived more
exemplary and diligent

694
00:55:27,592 --> 00:55:28,799
Like me

695
00:55:30,475 --> 00:55:33,675
To the Ministry of Education, the police,
the Blue House, the internet

696
00:55:34,950 --> 00:55:37,646
I will tell everyone, and!

697
00:55:41,013 --> 00:55:42,827
to legislator Changjun Kim too

698
00:55:50,586 --> 00:55:52,103
I'll also talk about Hwan's story

699
00:55:54,558 --> 00:55:57,163
How the principal is ruining his own son

700
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:21,800
You should listen to your mom

701
00:56:23,211 --> 00:56:24,994
to be a good son...

702
00:56:33,325 --> 00:56:35,628
Cein, can you open the door?

703
00:56:37,525 --> 00:56:39,605
You really won't see me again, huh?

704
00:56:41,187 --> 00:56:42,331
Cein

705
00:56:43,039 --> 00:56:45,147
Do you really hate seeing me that much?

706
00:56:47,484 --> 00:56:48,742
Cein

707
00:56:57,779 --> 00:56:58,973
I'm sorry

708
00:56:59,485 --> 00:57:00,794
I'm sorry

709
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:16,704
Bro

710
00:57:18,398 --> 00:57:19,588
I'll come back tomorrow

711
00:57:21,704 --> 00:57:23,309
Let me apologize face to face tomorrow

712
00:57:28,069 --> 00:57:29,282
I'm leaving now

713
00:57:55,489 --> 00:57:58,881
A message that informs
Jeha's location to Mingook
Text me if it's done

714
00:57:59,344 --> 00:58:01,729
Jeha's just left

715
00:58:13,864 --> 00:58:17,071
Banner of Changjun Kim, National Party
Member of Parliament's office

716
00:58:30,771 --> 00:58:32,978
If you keep hating me,
I might as well die

717
00:58:33,666 --> 00:58:34,964
This guy...

718
00:58:35,832 --> 00:58:38,270
Just as your mom did

719
00:59:01,729 --> 00:59:04,457
I'm gonna kill you for real, just wait

720
00:59:52,782 --> 00:59:53,933
What's this?

721
01:00:05,333 --> 01:00:06,481
Did you do this?

722
01:00:09,493 --> 01:00:11,578
I don't particularly have
a grudge against you

723
01:00:13,063 --> 01:00:17,303
But I hate that Jeha
likes you so much

724
01:00:20,504 --> 01:00:24,399
Surprisingly, that kid is strong and
doesn't seem to hurt when he gets hit

725
01:00:31,879 --> 01:00:33,102
So

726
01:00:34,413 --> 01:00:35,695
I have to trouble you

727
01:00:36,781 --> 01:00:38,883
to make that kid suffer

728
01:00:54,391 --> 01:00:55,795
Hey, why aren't you answering the phone?

729
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:00,590
It was Mingook joking around

730
01:01:03,924 --> 01:01:05,729
Do you think he looks happy?

731
01:01:08,704 --> 01:01:09,854
Not really

732
01:01:11,359 --> 01:01:13,448
But I wish he were more miserable

733
01:01:15,819 --> 01:01:20,146
I wish his mom just suddenly
died and disappeared

734
01:01:21,247 --> 01:01:24,962
Leaving Jeha all alone

735
01:01:26,547 --> 01:01:27,709
And then

736
01:01:29,222 --> 01:01:32,823
I wish some strange woman came

737
01:01:35,084 --> 01:01:38,382
to take his Mom's place
bringing her own son

738
01:01:41,522 --> 01:01:43,623
Stop making excuses

739
01:01:43,624 --> 01:01:45,322
Just admit you're scared
of being abandoned

740
01:01:47,050 --> 01:01:49,357
And don't drag me into your family issues

741
01:01:50,857 --> 01:01:52,808
I'm overwhelmed with my own

742
01:01:55,392 --> 01:01:56,550
You guys!

743
01:01:58,838 --> 01:02:03,053
Pretending to be okay for
each other, I can't stand it!

744
01:02:03,737 --> 01:02:09,437
I wish you and Jeha were
both suffering miserably

745
01:02:10,435 --> 01:02:12,454
It's annoying that's not the case

746
01:02:13,636 --> 01:02:14,836
Why do you live like that?

747
01:02:18,686 --> 01:02:20,675
Hey, annoying, right?

748
01:02:21,375 --> 01:02:22,488
Want to hit me?

749
01:02:24,514 --> 01:02:25,711
Hit me

750
01:02:25,712 --> 01:02:27,523
Hey, hey!

751
01:02:28,910 --> 01:02:30,717
That's why I set this up

752
01:02:32,820 --> 01:02:35,309
You're about to get expelled
from school anyway

753
01:02:35,909 --> 01:02:39,310
If you hit me, that'll be
the end of you at school

754
01:02:39,809 --> 01:02:41,238
And once you're gone

755
01:02:42,338 --> 01:02:44,436
Jeha will crumble too

756
01:02:46,626 --> 01:02:47,786
Hit me, come on

757
01:02:48,988 --> 01:02:50,188
Hit me!

758
01:02:51,092 --> 01:02:52,386
Hit me!

759
01:03:15,057 --> 01:03:16,261
Hit me

760
01:03:17,255 --> 01:03:18,464
Hit!

761
01:03:19,192 --> 01:03:20,256
Cein

762
01:03:20,754 --> 01:03:21,783
Let's go

763
01:03:24,645 --> 01:03:26,006
Where are you going, Jeha?

764
01:03:29,513 --> 01:03:30,706
Hey

765
01:03:32,007 --> 01:03:33,148
Hey

766
01:03:33,953 --> 01:03:35,214
What's with you? Wake up!

767
01:03:35,701 --> 01:03:36,944
Hey

768
01:03:44,601 --> 01:03:46,601
You're gonna stay with him forever?

769
01:03:47,611 --> 01:03:48,859
No, you won't

770
01:03:50,470 --> 01:03:51,651
And Jeha,

771
01:03:54,797 --> 01:03:56,520
he gets scolded because of you

772
01:03:57,613 --> 01:04:00,912
My dad and his mom

773
01:04:02,430 --> 01:04:04,513
hate it when he hangs out with you

774
01:04:05,413 --> 01:04:07,510
But he still follows you around

775
01:04:07,911 --> 01:04:09,001
Yes, it's Jeha...

776
01:04:11,582 --> 01:04:13,863
Why are you guys so close?

777
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,160
Birds of a feather?

778
01:04:19,559 --> 01:04:20,782
Well

779
01:04:21,462 --> 01:04:25,572
I heard it was your mom who seduced
Changjun Kim and caused his divorce

780
01:04:27,302 --> 01:04:28,502
Disgusting

781
01:04:39,261 --> 01:04:42,678
Your mom attempted suicide
several times because of her depression

782
01:04:51,146 --> 01:04:52,945
Actually, it was not you
who killed her but

783
01:04:54,359 --> 01:04:55,947
she just committed suicide, right?

784
01:04:58,641 --> 01:04:59,845
Wow

785
01:05:00,740 --> 01:05:02,641
Then you didn't kill her

786
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:04,552
Must be tough for you, hey

787
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:06,565
You just...

788
01:05:07,451 --> 01:05:10,352
let your mom die on her own, right?

789
01:05:11,152 --> 01:05:12,326
Letting it happen

790
01:05:13,526 --> 01:05:14,745
Yes, right

791
01:05:15,725 --> 01:05:16,916
You must have had it hard too

792
01:05:17,618 --> 01:05:18,885
You wanted to feel at ease, didn't you?

793
01:05:20,086 --> 01:05:23,274
Ah, so you just left it be?

794
01:05:25,075 --> 01:05:26,576
Just letting her die?

795
01:05:39,266 --> 01:05:42,067
Cein, don't do it, please don't!

796
01:05:46,364 --> 01:05:48,758
Hey! Hey, this is all being filmed, right?

797
01:05:48,759 --> 01:05:50,758
Hey, upload this unedited!

798
01:05:54,462 --> 01:05:56,687
Hey, hey, hey Cein Min

799
01:05:56,688 --> 01:05:58,887
Hey, hey, no Cein Min

800
01:05:59,658 --> 01:06:01,281
Hey, hey, wake up, hey

801
01:06:01,282 --> 01:06:04,214
This isn't right, hey, stop him!

802
01:06:06,510 --> 01:06:08,253
Hey, hey, hey!

803
01:06:08,905 --> 01:06:11,420
Hey, hey, don't do this to me

804
01:06:11,737 --> 01:06:13,320
Cein!

805
01:06:27,536 --> 01:06:28,921
Come back safe

806
01:06:40,076 --> 01:06:41,189
It's me

807
01:06:42,338 --> 01:06:43,541
Jeha, Jeha

808
01:06:49,465 --> 01:06:50,681
Let's go now

809
01:06:52,747 --> 01:06:54,440
Let's stop this and go, bro

810
01:06:56,551 --> 01:06:57,832
Let's go now

811
01:06:59,803 --> 01:07:02,257
Let's stop this and go, bro, okay?

812
01:07:15,416 --> 01:07:16,890
It's all fake, damn it!

813
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:27,001
There's no such thing
as friends or whatever

814
01:07:28,492 --> 01:07:30,439
It's all fake, you idiot!

815
01:07:32,649 --> 01:07:34,947
No, he was just here until a moment ago...

816
01:08:07,901 --> 01:08:22,260
We Must Survive!

817
01:08:44,091 --> 01:08:45,341
What...

818
01:08:48,901 --> 01:08:50,292
do you want, sir?

819
01:08:54,085 --> 01:08:56,182
Seems like Cein knows something

820
01:08:56,679 --> 01:09:00,175
Hwan wasn't just taking care of the plants

821
01:09:04,655 --> 01:09:05,845
Didn't you know?

822
01:09:07,149 --> 01:09:11,457
You seemed close so I thought
you already told him

823
01:09:16,276 --> 01:09:21,430
Seems like you kept it secret
even from them

824
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:25,626
Oh dear
