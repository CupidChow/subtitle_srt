00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,300
This series is based on a fictionalized story inspired by the story of BTS's album,
The Most Beautiful Moment in Life,
and is not related to BTS members and their families.

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,300
Child actors and animals were filmed
in safe conditions under the supervision of their guardians.

3
00:00:13,406 --> 00:00:15,631
Get out of the way!

4
00:00:32,268 --> 00:00:33,198
Make way

5
00:00:35,332 --> 00:00:36,378
Make way!

6
00:00:38,215 --> 00:00:39,342
Make way!

7
00:01:01,501 --> 00:01:03,238
Oh, my

8
00:02:39,605 --> 00:02:40,631
Hwan

9
00:02:41,297 --> 00:02:42,332
You made it

10
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,083
REDEVELOPMENT FOR WHOM?
Did I also live here?

11
00:02:47,818 --> 00:02:48,818
You?

12
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:51,183
You lived here until you were five

13
00:02:51,474 --> 00:02:53,140
Before your parents left for Seoul

14
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:04,685
Hwan, it's getting late. Let's go

15
00:03:11,452 --> 00:03:13,318
I reserved a quiet Korean table d'hote restaurant

16
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:15,353
for your meeting with Songho Scholarship Foundation

17
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:20,351
Excuse me, Ma'am

18
00:03:20,874 --> 00:03:22,279
Oh, she's getting the school uniform

19
00:03:22,864 --> 00:03:24,454
And the meeting at 6 p.m....

20
00:03:24,455 --> 00:03:25,793
Today's your first day of school, isn't it?

21
00:03:26,454 --> 00:03:28,006
Ah, yes

22
00:03:33,163 --> 00:03:34,544
Um...

23
00:03:34,812 --> 00:03:35,820
I don't know how to say this

24
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:38,336
I went to the tailor shop

25
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,586
to pick your tailored school uniform up,

26
00:03:42,206 --> 00:03:44,103
but it's not open yet

27
00:03:44,104 --> 00:03:45,357
They are not answering their phone

28
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,503
Here is your soup

29
00:03:51,812 --> 00:03:52,832
Ma'am

30
00:03:53,322 --> 00:03:55,667
What do you expect us to do?

31
00:03:55,927 --> 00:03:57,446
That's nothing to brag about

32
00:03:58,855 --> 00:04:01,058
They told me to come get it today

33
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:02,715
It's okay

34
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,559
I'll just wear this to school

35
00:04:04,771 --> 00:04:06,504
What do you mean, "It's okay?"

36
00:04:07,073 --> 00:04:09,070
He's all nervous
because it's his first day of school

37
00:04:09,071 --> 00:04:11,082
It's ridiculous that
he's not in his uniform

38
00:04:11,983 --> 00:04:13,291
Just go to school for today

39
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:16,286
I'll talk to the principal myself

40
00:04:17,856 --> 00:04:18,936
Okay

41
00:04:19,421 --> 00:04:20,713
Let's discuss this later

42
00:04:22,172 --> 00:04:23,387
Take your hand out of your pocket

43
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:24,830
Hello

44
00:04:24,832 --> 00:04:25,650
Yeah, hi

45
00:04:25,652 --> 00:04:27,527
Earphone!

46
00:04:28,924 --> 00:04:30,881
Come here

47
00:04:30,882 --> 00:04:32,418
I got you. Where do you think you're hiding?

48
00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:33,058
Come here!

49
00:04:33,752 --> 00:04:35,726
- Huh?
- Sir

50
00:04:35,727 --> 00:04:37,419
- Good morning
- You think I can't see you?

51
00:04:38,401 --> 00:04:40,573
Necktie is a part of your uniform

52
00:04:40,574 --> 00:04:42,155
I told you to wear it at home

53
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:43,492
- You try to walk in all suave
- Thank you

54
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,264
Why didn't you wear your tie at home?

55
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:48,050
- I'll go in now
- Go inside

56
00:04:48,051 --> 00:04:48,928
Thank you, sir

57
00:04:50,818 --> 00:04:51,999
SONGJOO JEIL HIGH SCHOOL
Huh?

58
00:04:52,913 --> 00:04:53,600
You!

59
00:04:54,398 --> 00:04:56,103
It's you! The new student

60
00:04:56,698 --> 00:04:58,073
- Right?
- Hello

61
00:04:58,074 --> 00:04:59,134
Come in

62
00:05:00,474 --> 00:05:01,648
What's your name, again?

63
00:05:02,029 --> 00:05:03,023
It's Hwan Kim

64
00:05:03,466 --> 00:05:05,320
You are good-looking

65
00:05:06,174 --> 00:05:07,294
I'm the disciplinarian

66
00:05:13,644 --> 00:05:14,904
Where is your greeting?

67
00:05:16,202 --> 00:05:17,377
This kid

68
00:05:17,378 --> 00:05:19,466
Not a day passes without you making a scene

69
00:05:23,112 --> 00:05:24,713
That knucklehead

70
00:05:29,594 --> 00:05:30,567
Let's go in

71
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,891
Because we have a different education system from the States

72
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,623
I put you in the eleventh grade

73
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,345
It'd be easier for you to adjust

74
00:05:41,707 --> 00:05:42,850
If you go to the twelfth grade

75
00:05:42,851 --> 00:05:44,724
you have to prepare for the college entrance exam

76
00:05:44,725 --> 00:05:45,645
Don't you agree?

77
00:05:45,827 --> 00:05:46,732
Thank you

78
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:53,547
I'll help him
to adjust to the new school life

79
00:05:55,176 --> 00:05:56,563
You do that
THE 10TH SONGHO SCHOLARSHIP FOUNDATION

80
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,053
You can come to me directly

81
00:05:58,258 --> 00:06:00,082
if you have difficulties

82
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,930
You might already know

83
00:06:04,485 --> 00:06:06,545
but your father and grandfather

84
00:06:06,885 --> 00:06:08,572
were born and raised in an esteemed family

85
00:06:08,573 --> 00:06:09,904
here in Songjoo

86
00:06:10,255 --> 00:06:12,140
Our acquaintance runs deep

87
00:06:14,251 --> 00:06:16,178
I hope you will be a good student

88
00:06:16,568 --> 00:06:18,133
to live up to your father's name

89
00:06:21,432 --> 00:06:22,547
Looking at you

90
00:06:22,961 --> 00:06:24,518
reminds me of your father

91
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,434
who was also my student

92
00:06:26,703 --> 00:06:28,585
I believe we'll have no problem getting along

93
00:06:29,829 --> 00:06:31,186
like your father did

94
00:06:35,143 --> 00:06:36,129
Have your tea

95
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:37,742
Go ahead

96
00:06:38,434 --> 00:06:39,436
Okay

97
00:07:04,114 --> 00:07:05,620
CHANGJUN KIM, 16TH ALUMNI
THE 18TH ASSEMBLYMAN

98
00:07:07,849 --> 00:07:09,654
I hope you will be a good student

99
00:07:10,048 --> 00:07:11,732
to live up to your father's name

100
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:16,466
CHANGJUN KIM, 16TH ALUMNI
THE 18TH ASSEMBLYMAN

101
00:07:17,863 --> 00:07:20,815
We have a new student joining us

102
00:07:20,816 --> 00:07:21,918
He's Hwan Kim

103
00:07:22,723 --> 00:07:23,890
Be nice to him

104
00:07:23,891 --> 00:07:25,051
and help him adjust

105
00:07:25,052 --> 00:07:26,506
to the school, okay?

106
00:07:26,507 --> 00:07:27,661
- Okay
- Okay

107
00:07:27,662 --> 00:07:29,231
Hwan, introduce yourself briefly

108
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,030
I'm Hwan Kim. Nice to meet you

109
00:07:33,068 --> 00:07:34,141
Give him some clap!

110
00:07:35,724 --> 00:07:36,856
Go take the empty seat

111
00:07:37,148 --> 00:07:38,175
Class captain

112
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:39,268
Attention

113
00:07:39,535 --> 00:07:40,558
Bow

114
00:07:41,033 --> 00:07:42,181
- Hello
- Hello

115
00:07:42,182 --> 00:07:43,272
Anyone sick today?

116
00:07:43,273 --> 00:07:44,343
- No
- No

117
00:07:44,427 --> 00:07:45,620
It's getting cold these days...

118
00:07:45,912 --> 00:07:47,503
- Hello, Hwan
- Hello, Hwan

119
00:07:47,761 --> 00:07:48,793
Let's be friends

120
00:07:48,794 --> 00:07:49,814
Where do you live?

121
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,689
I...

122
00:07:51,773 --> 00:07:53,100
I'm one year older than you

123
00:07:53,334 --> 00:07:54,394
Who's Hwan?

124
00:07:55,896 --> 00:07:57,136
- Here sir
- Oh, I see

125
00:07:57,137 --> 00:07:58,208
Nice to meet you

126
00:07:59,256 --> 00:08:00,364
Attention

127
00:08:01,244 --> 00:08:02,256
Bow

128
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:03,591
- Thank you
- Thank you

129
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:16,782
Hey

130
00:08:17,749 --> 00:08:18,643
Never mind

131
00:08:28,223 --> 00:08:29,243
Hwan

132
00:08:36,947 --> 00:08:38,505
How was your first day?
Was everything okay?

133
00:08:40,715 --> 00:08:41,864
Wow, look

134
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:43,728
He's from a rich family, huh?

135
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:44,991
He even has his own driver

136
00:08:45,111 --> 00:08:47,191
I'm an aide, not a driver, you idiot

137
00:08:47,419 --> 00:08:48,701
Wow, he's charismatic

138
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:01,600
Sir

139
00:09:02,442 --> 00:09:04,041
Please get me a bike

140
00:09:05,134 --> 00:09:06,285
A bike? Why?

141
00:09:08,796 --> 00:09:10,633
It's a bit too much going to school like this

142
00:09:11,591 --> 00:09:13,186
That's why you want to take a bike?

143
00:09:14,104 --> 00:09:15,430
Your parents will be worried

144
00:09:16,373 --> 00:09:17,552
It's okay

145
00:09:18,031 --> 00:09:19,893
I used to ride a bike when I was in the States

146
00:09:22,588 --> 00:09:24,115
Okay, I'll have to ask your father

147
00:09:25,209 --> 00:09:26,249
How was school?

148
00:09:26,439 --> 00:09:27,713
Did you make any friends?

149
00:09:47,213 --> 00:09:48,299
It's all set

150
00:09:48,408 --> 00:09:49,432
Please come again

151
00:10:01,926 --> 00:10:03,255
Welcome

152
00:10:04,249 --> 00:10:05,389
How much do you need?

153
00:10:07,998 --> 00:10:11,352
81, 82, 83, 84, 85

154
00:10:14,829 --> 00:10:15,903
Here

155
00:10:16,156 --> 00:10:17,203
Thank you

156
00:10:17,287 --> 00:10:18,410
Thank you for your hard work

157
00:10:18,924 --> 00:10:20,050
But is this...

158
00:10:20,134 --> 00:10:21,267
for your father's hospital bill

159
00:10:21,268 --> 00:10:22,466
or your brother's settlement money?

160
00:10:24,889 --> 00:10:26,158
You carry such a heavy burden

161
00:10:26,242 --> 00:10:27,261
Cheer up

162
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:29,276
I'll see you tomorrow

163
00:10:29,505 --> 00:10:30,531
See you

164
00:10:38,431 --> 00:10:39,438
Hey, Jooan

165
00:10:41,411 --> 00:10:42,379
Jooan Kim

166
00:10:44,174 --> 00:10:45,213
Did you have dinner?

167
00:10:45,683 --> 00:10:47,910
I waited for you so we can eat together

168
00:10:49,577 --> 00:10:50,497
ENDLESS REDEVELOPMENT, WHO ON EARTH IS IT FOR?
I...

169
00:10:51,215 --> 00:10:52,351
have 2,000 won

170
00:10:55,111 --> 00:10:56,157
What?

171
00:10:56,487 --> 00:10:57,900
Are you that hungry?

172
00:10:58,279 --> 00:10:59,520
I also have my transit card

173
00:11:04,383 --> 00:11:05,536
I got my wage

174
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:11,474
Let's raid the convenience store with this

175
00:11:12,634 --> 00:11:14,240
I'll leave NOTHING behind

176
00:11:29,037 --> 00:11:31,517
It's times like this when my resolve gets tested

177
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:34,112
On one hand, I have chicken

178
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:35,938
and the other is bulgogi

179
00:11:37,647 --> 00:11:38,768
This is tasty...

180
00:11:39,127 --> 00:11:40,287
but this is delicious

181
00:11:47,603 --> 00:11:48,835
No hamburger?

182
00:11:49,499 --> 00:11:50,539
You love hamburgers

183
00:11:50,781 --> 00:11:52,470
Get the hamburger as well. Coke, too

184
00:11:52,757 --> 00:11:53,760
I'm fine

185
00:11:54,438 --> 00:11:56,870
I'm going to eat yours.
It tastes better when it's not mine

186
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:58,877
Fine, suit yourself

187
00:11:59,006 --> 00:12:00,123
Hey, hold on

188
00:12:02,742 --> 00:12:03,801
My ball

189
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:05,842
Ring it up with this, please

190
00:12:07,121 --> 00:12:08,194
Here's 2,000 won

191
00:12:11,934 --> 00:12:12,861
Oh, shoot

192
00:12:14,495 --> 00:12:15,560
What are you doing?

193
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:18,094
Reacting

194
00:12:27,816 --> 00:12:29,586
SCHOOL NEWSLETTER, PARENT COUNSELING APPLICATION

195
00:12:33,825 --> 00:12:35,252
You treat me all the time

196
00:12:35,572 --> 00:12:36,912
I felt bad. That's why I did it

197
00:12:38,661 --> 00:12:39,691
Should I keep this?

198
00:12:41,024 --> 00:12:42,320
Put it back in your pocket

199
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:50,587
I'll take the kimchi jeyuk bokkeum

200
00:12:54,711 --> 00:12:55,750
After you, sir

201
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,544
Why thank you

202
00:13:03,565 --> 00:13:05,015
Did you show him...

203
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:06,956
the school newsletter?

204
00:13:08,068 --> 00:13:09,133
Like he would come

205
00:13:09,134 --> 00:13:10,586
when he's always drunk like that

206
00:13:11,079 --> 00:13:12,079
What about you?

207
00:13:12,233 --> 00:13:13,526
I didn't even mention it

208
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:16,420
They're not interested anyway...

209
00:13:16,867 --> 00:13:17,957
Our parents

210
00:13:26,094 --> 00:13:26,971
Again?

211
00:13:28,061 --> 00:13:29,951
You always stop to look

212
00:13:30,588 --> 00:13:32,127
You like this house that much?

213
00:13:32,128 --> 00:13:33,243
or is it love?

214
00:13:33,514 --> 00:13:34,982
Why do you always stop by?

215
00:13:35,729 --> 00:13:37,208
If we live in such a house

216
00:13:37,755 --> 00:13:39,528
we'll have nothing to worry about, right?

217
00:13:40,428 --> 00:13:41,562
Beats me

218
00:13:41,567 --> 00:13:42,861
Like I would know, right?

219
00:13:45,168 --> 00:13:46,244
He did look...

220
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,415
like he had nothing to worry about

221
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:50,615
Who?

222
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:52,634
Hwan Kim

223
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,189
He lives here

224
00:13:57,588 --> 00:13:58,646
Hey, Jooan

225
00:13:59,024 --> 00:14:00,290
This house...

226
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:01,627
has another main gate on the other side

227
00:14:02,315 --> 00:14:04,279
Don't lie. What kind of a house has two gates?

228
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,422
I'm serious

229
00:14:05,571 --> 00:14:06,686
The gate on the other side...

230
00:14:06,694 --> 00:14:08,426
is bigger than our roof

231
00:14:11,616 --> 00:14:13,028
I don't buy it

232
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:15,156
You don't believe me?

233
00:14:15,903 --> 00:14:17,253
You want to see it for yourself?

234
00:15:12,435 --> 00:15:13,441
Come to mommy

235
00:15:13,907 --> 00:15:14,896
Come to mommy

236
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,853
Come over here to mommy

237
00:15:23,281 --> 00:15:24,409
One two

238
00:15:25,647 --> 00:15:27,338
Shall we go to your dad?

239
00:15:28,881 --> 00:15:30,174
Daddy

240
00:15:35,382 --> 00:15:36,473
Are you okay?

241
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:41,595
- Daddy
- It's okay

242
00:16:57,079 --> 00:16:58,187
Still not done?

243
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:00,641
It does look good

244
00:17:01,967 --> 00:17:03,623
Why doesn't Hwan Kim live in this mansion

245
00:17:03,624 --> 00:17:04,917
and live above Jeha's?

246
00:17:05,187 --> 00:17:07,187
That apartment is also good

247
00:17:07,707 --> 00:17:09,775
Rich people in our neighborhood
all live in that apartment

248
00:17:11,581 --> 00:17:12,536
Hey, Jooan

249
00:17:12,834 --> 00:17:13,676
Yeah?

250
00:17:14,753 --> 00:17:16,357
Have you ever been inside a house like this?

251
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,194
No

252
00:17:18,905 --> 00:17:21,021
Like houses on TV,

253
00:17:21,022 --> 00:17:22,693
if you climb the stone staircase,

254
00:17:23,183 --> 00:17:25,109
there's a front garden filled with grass

255
00:17:25,517 --> 00:17:27,730
and a big, handsome dog

256
00:17:32,686 --> 00:17:34,567
Well they don't seem to have a dog

257
00:17:34,859 --> 00:17:36,875
Yeah, but even without the dog

258
00:17:36,876 --> 00:17:38,934
they have a marbled floor

259
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:41,866
The one you see in gemstone saunas

260
00:17:48,444 --> 00:17:49,629
Hey, Jooan

261
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:53,950
Jooan, where are you?

262
00:17:57,727 --> 00:17:58,736
I'm here!

263
00:18:00,553 --> 00:18:01,434
Hey

264
00:18:01,728 --> 00:18:02,755
Why are you up there?

265
00:18:03,261 --> 00:18:05,157
Let's take a look if you're that curious

266
00:18:05,158 --> 00:18:06,371
It's empty anyway

267
00:18:06,983 --> 00:18:07,910
Come down

268
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,196
- No
- I said come down

269
00:18:10,997 --> 00:18:12,796
- I'll go alone and look inside
- Hey

270
00:18:14,639 --> 00:18:16,300
Hey!

271
00:18:19,677 --> 00:18:20,677
Hey, Jooan

272
00:18:21,237 --> 00:18:22,257
Are you alright?

273
00:18:23,237 --> 00:18:24,184
Are you hurt?

274
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:27,923
Hey, answer me

275
00:18:45,732 --> 00:18:46,846
Hey, Jooan

276
00:18:50,118 --> 00:18:51,201
Hey, Jooan...

277
00:18:59,868 --> 00:19:00,816
Dogeon

278
00:19:01,303 --> 00:19:02,316
Dogeon

279
00:19:03,982 --> 00:19:05,110
Where are you?

280
00:19:10,007 --> 00:19:10,916
Hey

281
00:19:11,341 --> 00:19:12,353
Hey, Jooan

282
00:19:23,855 --> 00:19:24,817
Hwan

283
00:19:25,436 --> 00:19:27,408
Didn't realize you were home

284
00:19:28,202 --> 00:19:29,136
Why is he here?

285
00:19:29,761 --> 00:19:31,435
I thought he lived in Jeha's apartment

286
00:19:33,595 --> 00:19:34,450
What?

287
00:19:35,227 --> 00:19:36,667
Why is he looking at me like that?

288
00:19:36,796 --> 00:19:39,465
- As if we're here to steal something...
- Hwan

289
00:19:40,914 --> 00:19:42,587
I'll explain everything

290
00:19:42,908 --> 00:19:44,195
Hwan, wait

291
00:19:44,196 --> 00:19:45,070
Wait

292
00:19:45,724 --> 00:19:47,779
What happened is...

293
00:19:48,268 --> 00:19:50,298
we were passing by...

294
00:19:50,299 --> 00:19:52,946
We just wanted to look at
what it's like inside

295
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:55,320
Yeah

296
00:19:56,118 --> 00:19:57,036
That's it

297
00:19:58,325 --> 00:19:59,463
That's what happened

298
00:20:04,233 --> 00:20:05,574
Yes, is this the police?

299
00:20:06,306 --> 00:20:09,819
We carefully patrol the area
since it's your father's house

300
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,227
You must have been startled

301
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:14,963
I've known them for a long while

302
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:18,131
They might be poor,
but they're not bad kids

303
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,934
They're from poor families

304
00:20:19,935 --> 00:20:21,955
so they just wanted to see
what it's like inside

305
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:23,660
They didn't steal anything

306
00:20:23,661 --> 00:20:24,848
and they're just students

307
00:20:28,285 --> 00:20:30,145
Please make sure this doesn't happen again

308
00:20:30,731 --> 00:20:31,666
Of course

309
00:20:31,667 --> 00:20:33,491
I will scold them hard

310
00:20:33,492 --> 00:20:36,453
so that this never happens again

311
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:42,699
Please put in a good word
to your father for us

312
00:20:43,238 --> 00:20:44,178
Okay?

313
00:20:44,179 --> 00:20:45,158
Alright

314
00:20:49,962 --> 00:20:51,569
You two

315
00:20:52,639 --> 00:20:53,782
You guys got lucky

316
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:56,016
We're letting you go
because he let it slide

317
00:20:56,017 --> 00:20:57,033
Understood?

318
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,439
- Yes
- Yes

319
00:20:59,814 --> 00:21:00,747
Get going

320
00:21:38,226 --> 00:21:39,145
Hey

321
00:21:39,146 --> 00:21:40,366
So you were home

322
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,823
- Hey, Hwan. We were...
- Hwan

323
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,232
I think I dropped my money envelope

324
00:21:46,233 --> 00:21:48,037
when I was climbing over the wall

325
00:21:48,603 --> 00:21:50,081
Could you please check?

326
00:21:52,676 --> 00:21:54,201
Hey, Hwan Kim. Can't you hear us?

327
00:21:54,695 --> 00:21:56,888
Check whether you have the envelope!

328
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,815
Or open the door

329
00:21:59,001 --> 00:22:00,435
so we can check for ourselves

330
00:22:01,015 --> 00:22:02,605
Hwan Kim, are you listening?

331
00:22:02,606 --> 00:22:03,635
It's not here

332
00:22:03,908 --> 00:22:04,848
What the

333
00:22:05,374 --> 00:22:06,911
He hasn't even looked yet

334
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,200
Just open the door

335
00:22:09,201 --> 00:22:10,525
We will check it ourselves

336
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:11,837
I said it isn't here

337
00:22:12,657 --> 00:22:13,530
What the

338
00:22:14,137 --> 00:22:15,070
Did he turn it off?

339
00:22:15,482 --> 00:22:16,490
Why you...

340
00:22:29,589 --> 00:22:30,819
Those morons

341
00:23:02,205 --> 00:23:03,831
Jooan, come down

342
00:23:05,477 --> 00:23:07,307
I'll just take a quick look

343
00:23:07,308 --> 00:23:09,355
- I said come down
- No

344
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,459
You need that money...

345
00:23:32,605 --> 00:23:34,223
Is this the police...

346
00:23:36,438 --> 00:23:37,478
Talk to him yourself

347
00:23:42,635 --> 00:23:44,219
You two

348
00:23:44,971 --> 00:23:46,939
I let you go earlier and you climbed the wall again?

349
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,105
Are you out of your mind?

350
00:23:49,293 --> 00:23:50,309
I'm sorry

351
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,065
I mean

352
00:23:52,512 --> 00:23:54,257
when he climbed the wall earlier

353
00:23:55,178 --> 00:23:56,512
he dropped his wage

354
00:23:56,513 --> 00:23:58,305
inside Hwan's house

355
00:23:58,823 --> 00:24:00,955
We asked Hwan to check for us

356
00:24:01,512 --> 00:24:03,059
and he couldn't even do that

357
00:24:03,311 --> 00:24:04,825
That was Dohyeon's settlement money

358
00:24:04,826 --> 00:24:05,839
Exactly

359
00:24:06,195 --> 00:24:07,405
Your brother always gets into trouble

360
00:24:07,406 --> 00:24:09,065
You can't afford to get into trouble yourself

361
00:24:09,637 --> 00:24:13,215
Your brother and your father
are regulars in our station

362
00:24:13,486 --> 00:24:15,483
Why do you have to mention my father here?

363
00:24:15,484 --> 00:24:16,450
Jooan Kim!

364
00:24:17,143 --> 00:24:18,837
What's that look

365
00:24:19,077 --> 00:24:20,177
You really want to get into trouble?

366
00:24:21,216 --> 00:24:22,303
We're sorry

367
00:24:23,314 --> 00:24:25,065
He just wanted to find...

368
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:27,626
my money envelope for me

369
00:24:28,158 --> 00:24:29,122
Money envelope?

370
00:24:31,158 --> 00:24:33,461
Did you see any envelopes?

371
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:36,665
I don't know

372
00:24:37,479 --> 00:24:38,531
If he dropped it

373
00:24:38,532 --> 00:24:40,293
I should've spotted it when I went back earlier

374
00:24:40,438 --> 00:24:41,272
See?

375
00:24:41,273 --> 00:24:42,574
He says he doesn't have it

376
00:24:42,997 --> 00:24:45,686
You are not making all this conundrum

377
00:24:45,687 --> 00:24:46,810
because you need money, are you?

378
00:24:46,811 --> 00:24:48,013
Of course not!

379
00:24:48,466 --> 00:24:49,806
It's humiliating

380
00:24:49,807 --> 00:24:51,819
- Mister
- What? Mister?

381
00:24:52,652 --> 00:24:53,505
You kids

382
00:24:53,506 --> 00:24:55,419
I tried to be lenient since
I've known you for a while

383
00:24:55,811 --> 00:24:57,617
but I'm not letting you go this time

384
00:24:57,993 --> 00:25:00,015
I'm calling your parents and your school!

385
00:25:01,309 --> 00:25:02,802
Can I go now?

386
00:25:03,287 --> 00:25:04,871
Oh, yes, you can go

387
00:25:04,872 --> 00:25:07,510
We'll punish them severely this time

388
00:25:07,909 --> 00:25:09,482
Please talk to your father for...

389
00:25:16,804 --> 00:25:18,376
This is crazy

390
00:25:18,444 --> 00:25:19,416
Hey, Hwan Kim

391
00:25:19,543 --> 00:25:21,799
Keep that up. Let's see where you end up

392
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:27,308
Even my boss at the gas station will vouch for this

393
00:25:27,805 --> 00:25:30,124
I got paid in cash,
for my part-time job today

394
00:25:30,125 --> 00:25:31,023
but...

395
00:25:31,936 --> 00:25:33,165
it disappeared somehow

396
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:35,204
He said he doesn't have it

397
00:25:35,205 --> 00:25:36,450
Get moving

398
00:26:24,504 --> 00:26:25,374
Huh?

399
00:26:26,719 --> 00:26:27,671
My bike

400
00:26:30,643 --> 00:26:31,655
Hey, Hwan Kim

401
00:26:31,948 --> 00:26:34,302
Keep that up. Let's see where you end up

402
00:26:35,775 --> 00:26:36,896
My camcorder

403
00:26:53,676 --> 00:26:54,589
Hello?

404
00:26:56,885 --> 00:26:58,210
Ah, yes. The bike?

405
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:00,530
Yeah, the price is negotiable

406
00:27:01,979 --> 00:27:04,547
Then how about doing a direct transaction

407
00:27:04,548 --> 00:27:06,106
in front of the Songjoo City Hall at 5 p.m.?

408
00:27:08,729 --> 00:27:09,800
Oh, okay

409
00:27:10,007 --> 00:27:11,096
I'll meet you later then

410
00:27:26,287 --> 00:27:27,374
Good morning

411
00:27:27,667 --> 00:27:28,637
Where's your bike?

412
00:27:30,377 --> 00:27:31,572
I left it at school

413
00:27:32,269 --> 00:27:34,286
What if someone steals it?

414
00:27:34,776 --> 00:27:37,890
The bums in this neighborhood might
steal anything that expensive

415
00:27:38,383 --> 00:27:39,736
You want me to drop you off?

416
00:27:40,229 --> 00:27:41,271
I'm good

417
00:27:42,296 --> 00:27:43,376
Have a good day

418
00:27:54,849 --> 00:27:56,487
Hey, rock, paper, scissors

419
00:27:56,896 --> 00:27:58,161
Rock, paper, scissors

420
00:28:12,977 --> 00:28:14,413
You stole this bike, didn't you?

421
00:28:15,191 --> 00:28:16,622
- What?
- You stole this

422
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:21,081
I did steal it but...

423
00:28:21,225 --> 00:28:22,579
Give it back. It's mine

424
00:28:24,504 --> 00:28:25,828
What did you do with the camcorder?

425
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,344
What camcorder?

426
00:28:28,345 --> 00:28:29,932
There was a camcorder here

427
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:33,867
This isn't yours

428
00:28:39,559 --> 00:28:40,479
Hey!

429
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:45,072
This isn't yours, you jerk

430
00:28:45,073 --> 00:28:47,261
Jooan, what are you doing?

431
00:28:48,208 --> 00:28:49,577
Hwan, are you okay?

432
00:28:51,743 --> 00:28:53,267
Hwan!

433
00:28:54,278 --> 00:28:55,586
Stop

434
00:28:55,587 --> 00:28:56,920
You two stole it from me

435
00:28:56,921 --> 00:28:59,164
- It isn't yours, you psycho
- Stop

436
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:02,276
What's going on?

437
00:29:02,277 --> 00:29:03,270
- Wait
- Hey!

438
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:05,494
- Hey
- You bastard

439
00:29:08,745 --> 00:29:10,277
Hey, Jooan!

440
00:29:10,278 --> 00:29:11,161
Jooan

441
00:29:11,325 --> 00:29:12,543
Get off me

442
00:29:12,767 --> 00:29:13,843
Hey, Jooan

443
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,313
Let go!

444
00:29:16,908 --> 00:29:18,058
Hey!

445
00:29:18,449 --> 00:29:19,764
You blockheads!

446
00:29:19,971 --> 00:29:21,846
You blockheads!

447
00:29:22,128 --> 00:29:23,343
Have you lost your mind?

448
00:29:23,589 --> 00:29:24,945
Stop, all of you!

449
00:29:25,053 --> 00:29:26,387
Stop it, all of you!

450
00:29:26,679 --> 00:29:28,960
What are you doing? Get up!

451
00:29:29,193 --> 00:29:30,699
You fool

452
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,757
He must've gone mad

453
00:29:34,383 --> 00:29:35,388
Are you okay?

454
00:29:35,777 --> 00:29:36,640
Huh?

455
00:29:37,644 --> 00:29:39,783
What do you think you're doing?

456
00:29:39,784 --> 00:29:41,074
Acting like gangsters

457
00:29:41,335 --> 00:29:41,996
Huh?

458
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,171
Shoot

459
00:29:44,318 --> 00:29:46,830
- Why did he have to hit me?
- Don't try anything,

460
00:29:46,831 --> 00:29:48,915
Form a line and follow me, understood?

461
00:29:49,544 --> 00:29:51,204
Acting like gangsters, these blockheads

462
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,467
Follow me

463
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,137
Follow me, you fools

464
00:30:12,406 --> 00:30:15,108
You've all gone mad, haven't you?

465
00:30:15,798 --> 00:30:19,179
I got a call from the police first thing

466
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:21,351
as soon as I arrived at school

467
00:30:21,625 --> 00:30:24,380
and I felt annoyed, Dogeon Kim

468
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:26,625
Okay

469
00:30:28,849 --> 00:30:30,655
That eighth grader you were with yesterday?

470
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,211
You must be Jooan Kim

471
00:30:33,556 --> 00:30:35,251
Why did you break into the legislator's house?

472
00:30:35,252 --> 00:30:36,800
You went in to steal things, didn't you?

473
00:30:36,801 --> 00:30:38,115
I didn't steal anything

474
00:30:38,116 --> 00:30:39,716
You did steal my bike

475
00:30:39,717 --> 00:30:40,825
and my camcorder

476
00:30:41,164 --> 00:30:42,439
We didn't steal it

477
00:30:42,604 --> 00:30:45,002
That bike isn't yours!

478
00:30:46,356 --> 00:30:48,397
Come on, say something

479
00:30:49,221 --> 00:30:51,220
Dogeon Kim, did you steal a bike?

480
00:30:52,177 --> 00:30:53,913
I'm not the one who stole it

481
00:30:54,688 --> 00:30:56,500
You. Did you steal it?

482
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:58,033
Oh, my

483
00:30:58,034 --> 00:30:59,802
You're still wet behind the ears

484
00:31:00,121 --> 00:31:01,950
You are just an eighth grader

485
00:31:01,951 --> 00:31:04,265
You should get yourself together!

486
00:31:04,266 --> 00:31:05,873
I said I didn't steal it!

487
00:31:07,183 --> 00:31:08,314
Look at this kid

488
00:31:10,896 --> 00:31:11,736
Sir

489
00:31:11,737 --> 00:31:13,702
How about hearing him out?

490
00:31:13,703 --> 00:31:15,736
Hear what out?

491
00:31:17,035 --> 00:31:18,512
Anyway, all of you will...

492
00:31:19,197 --> 00:31:21,849
- get detention starting today, got it?
- What? Me too?

493
00:31:22,323 --> 00:31:24,284
- I just tried to stop them
- Shush

494
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,573
Hwan, you get going

495
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:33,972
Get inside

496
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,058
Why are you letting him go?

497
00:31:38,059 --> 00:31:40,114
He was the one who started the fight!

498
00:31:40,374 --> 00:31:41,514
Shut it!

499
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:45,430
I saw you throwing the first punch

500
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:48,863
Hwan, I said get inside

501
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,060
Go

502
00:31:52,547 --> 00:31:53,548
Go study

503
00:31:56,472 --> 00:31:57,499
Why you little...

504
00:31:58,371 --> 00:32:01,196
Why are you staring at him like that?
Wipe off that look

505
00:32:45,198 --> 00:32:46,298
You knucklehead

506
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:52,538
I saw you lying down

507
00:32:52,539 --> 00:32:54,231
I caught you

508
00:32:54,542 --> 00:32:57,425
You get an extra month of detention

509
00:32:57,427 --> 00:32:58,507
Understood?

510
00:33:01,101 --> 00:33:03,248
You guys, too will serve detention

511
00:33:03,249 --> 00:33:05,001
for the entire semester, understood?

512
00:33:05,112 --> 00:33:07,487
First, clean this place up

513
00:33:07,488 --> 00:33:09,240
Throw out all this trash

514
00:33:09,242 --> 00:33:10,655
and get rid of spider webs

515
00:33:11,234 --> 00:33:12,286
This entire place?

516
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:14,722
Our class is starting soon

517
00:33:14,724 --> 00:33:16,447
You shouldn't have picked a fight
as you came to school

518
00:33:16,448 --> 00:33:18,689
if you cared that much about classes starting

519
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:20,930
Sir, we also have
the parent-teacher meeting today

520
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:24,367
That doesn't concern you, does it?

521
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:25,673
Are they even coming this time?

522
00:33:30,184 --> 00:33:31,199
After class,

523
00:33:31,201 --> 00:33:34,144
come and clean this place up
every recess and lunch

524
00:33:34,497 --> 00:33:36,210
I'll be keeping track, understood?

525
00:33:37,429 --> 00:33:38,109
- Yes
- Yes

526
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:40,664
You, knucklehead

527
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:42,520
I have my eyes on you

528
00:33:42,522 --> 00:33:43,915
My eyes, on you

529
00:33:45,268 --> 00:33:46,844
That knucklehead...

530
00:33:49,202 --> 00:33:50,337
Goodbye, sir

531
00:33:50,622 --> 00:33:51,665
Goodbye, sir

532
00:33:58,685 --> 00:33:59,979
Are your parents coming?

533
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,208
I didn't even tell them

534
00:34:05,108 --> 00:34:06,089
Me neither

535
00:34:06,888 --> 00:34:08,076
It's not that I didn't

536
00:34:08,077 --> 00:34:09,368
I just couldn't

537
00:34:13,774 --> 00:34:15,400
Anyway, let's start cleaning

538
00:34:15,402 --> 00:34:16,283
Fine

539
00:34:18,554 --> 00:34:19,438
Jooan

540
00:34:19,727 --> 00:34:22,270
Let's move the desks to one side

541
00:34:23,389 --> 00:34:24,516
Hurry

542
00:34:24,855 --> 00:34:26,090
I'll move the instruments

543
00:34:27,829 --> 00:34:29,391
Hey, grandpa

544
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,262
You should start cleaning, too

545
00:34:31,509 --> 00:34:33,065
No, I won't

546
00:34:34,547 --> 00:34:37,552
That's why your detention is never-ending

547
00:34:37,554 --> 00:34:38,696
He might let you off the hook

548
00:34:38,698 --> 00:34:39,793
if you actually made an effort

549
00:34:39,794 --> 00:34:42,503
That will never happen, ever

550
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:47,963
I didn't know there was a mirror here

551
00:34:50,236 --> 00:34:52,021
Is this a dance room or something?

552
00:34:53,936 --> 00:34:55,167
There's even a piano

553
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,701
Hey

554
00:34:57,853 --> 00:34:59,876
This place is quite good as a hideout

555
00:35:00,413 --> 00:35:01,282
Right?

556
00:35:06,092 --> 00:35:08,032
Cein, where are you going without cleaning?

557
00:35:08,782 --> 00:35:09,714
Huh?

558
00:35:09,802 --> 00:35:11,109
Where are you going?

559
00:35:12,241 --> 00:35:14,220
Don't mind him. Let's do it ourselves

560
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:17,263
How come Hwan got away with this?

561
00:35:22,864 --> 00:35:23,870
Dogeon

562
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,183
The bike

563
00:35:31,145 --> 00:35:32,802
What? Where are you guys going?

564
00:35:33,122 --> 00:35:33,999
Hey!

565
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:42,693
Please look after my boy

566
00:35:43,342 --> 00:35:44,388
I will

567
00:36:15,845 --> 00:36:16,865
Oh, Hwan

568
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:18,688
I was going to call you

569
00:36:18,986 --> 00:36:21,345
Your father's secretary just called me

570
00:36:21,553 --> 00:36:23,371
Your father's attending a performance event

571
00:36:23,373 --> 00:36:25,453
so he can't make it
to the parent-teacher meeting today

572
00:36:27,247 --> 00:36:28,805
Oh, okay

573
00:36:29,624 --> 00:36:32,418
Government officials are always busy

574
00:36:55,305 --> 00:36:56,331
You

575
00:36:56,978 --> 00:36:58,634
I heard you're still in detention

576
00:36:59,986 --> 00:37:02,266
You often skip school and are late for classes

577
00:37:05,689 --> 00:37:06,797
I have some business to attend to

578
00:37:06,798 --> 00:37:07,909
so I need to return to my unit

579
00:37:08,699 --> 00:37:09,942
We'll talk over the weekend

580
00:37:10,262 --> 00:37:11,195
And also,

581
00:37:12,441 --> 00:37:14,395
Let's visit your mother the week after next

582
00:37:15,465 --> 00:37:16,458
Okay

583
00:37:24,003 --> 00:37:25,377
Don't get into trouble

584
00:37:25,667 --> 00:37:26,637
Okay?

585
00:37:29,124 --> 00:37:30,150
Okay

586
00:37:52,412 --> 00:37:53,586
Wow

587
00:37:54,638 --> 00:37:55,613
Woah

588
00:37:57,165 --> 00:37:58,173
Wow

589
00:37:58,339 --> 00:37:59,500
I don't know a thing about bikes

590
00:37:59,501 --> 00:38:00,705
but even I can tell it's expensive

591
00:38:01,384 --> 00:38:02,930
It will cost you around 1,000,000 won

592
00:38:03,256 --> 00:38:04,643
My brother has this model

593
00:38:04,645 --> 00:38:05,682
He said it's legit

594
00:38:05,684 --> 00:38:06,840
Really?

595
00:38:06,842 --> 00:38:07,952
Hey

596
00:38:08,418 --> 00:38:09,906
Isn't this the perfect place to goof around?

597
00:38:09,908 --> 00:38:12,632
The disciplinarian will ask us
to clean other places after this

598
00:38:12,634 --> 00:38:13,817
Let's just stay here

599
00:38:14,804 --> 00:38:16,591
But why are you in detention?

600
00:38:16,935 --> 00:38:18,279
Wasn't Jooan the one who got into the fight?

601
00:38:19,132 --> 00:38:20,170
That's because of me

602
00:38:21,073 --> 00:38:21,999
I'm sorry

603
00:38:22,001 --> 00:38:23,933
Never mind. You don't have to apologize

604
00:38:24,944 --> 00:38:27,294
It's so freaking fun
to goof around together

605
00:38:27,296 --> 00:38:28,047
Right?

606
00:38:28,049 --> 00:38:29,980
But where did you get this bike?

607
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:33,060
- Is it Hwan's?
- No, it's not!

608
00:38:33,131 --> 00:38:35,012
It's Dogeon's

609
00:38:35,014 --> 00:38:37,161
Dogeon's brother stole it

610
00:38:40,001 --> 00:38:41,427
Sorry, Dogeon

611
00:38:41,654 --> 00:38:43,087
That was MIT, wasn't it?

612
00:38:43,089 --> 00:38:43,994
TMI

613
00:38:43,995 --> 00:38:45,027
Really?

614
00:38:45,054 --> 00:38:46,464
- Your brother?
- Yeah

615
00:38:46,611 --> 00:38:48,481
I guess he wanted it since it's a good bike

616
00:38:48,824 --> 00:38:51,512
So we tried to return it

617
00:38:51,514 --> 00:38:53,648
but the owner didn't want it anymore

618
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:55,094
He told us he wanted to sue us

619
00:38:55,454 --> 00:38:58,061
He made all this fuss asking for settlement money

620
00:38:59,616 --> 00:39:01,403
That's why I brought it
to sell it off

621
00:39:01,944 --> 00:39:03,089
No wonder

622
00:39:03,499 --> 00:39:05,535
Hwan wouldn't be like that for no reason

623
00:39:06,701 --> 00:39:07,808
Jeha Jeon

624
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:09,182
What's that supposed to mean?

625
00:39:09,809 --> 00:39:11,404
Are you implying that we would?

626
00:39:12,251 --> 00:39:14,097
No, what Jeha meant was

627
00:39:14,629 --> 00:39:17,813
why would a rich guy like him
want other people's bikes?

628
00:39:18,021 --> 00:39:19,081
That's what he meant

629
00:39:20,076 --> 00:39:21,884
So Hwan is the one who got it all wrong

630
00:39:23,622 --> 00:39:24,889
That's what I meant

631
00:39:26,836 --> 00:39:27,948
Right

632
00:39:28,568 --> 00:39:30,782
- Let's get inside and start cleaning
- Yeah, okay

633
00:39:49,138 --> 00:39:51,339
Wow, this tastes freaking good

634
00:39:52,865 --> 00:39:54,041
It's really good

635
00:39:57,004 --> 00:39:58,970
Why are you biting your nail
instead of the tteokbokki?

636
00:39:59,388 --> 00:40:01,324
Why aren't you eating? You bought this

637
00:40:03,253 --> 00:40:05,493
He must've gotten scolded during the meeting

638
00:40:06,323 --> 00:40:07,946
Your father gave you some pocket money

639
00:40:07,948 --> 00:40:08,919
Right?

640
00:40:09,934 --> 00:40:12,047
You always use up the money
the day you get it

641
00:40:14,367 --> 00:40:15,434
Jeha Jeon

642
00:40:16,176 --> 00:40:17,632
Aren't your parents coming?

643
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,235
I think they're coming

644
00:40:19,835 --> 00:40:21,695
but they're coming for Mingook

645
00:40:22,611 --> 00:40:24,194
My father's not interested in me

646
00:40:25,303 --> 00:40:27,297
But Jeha, is it okay to eat with us?

647
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:30,285
You said your family
always have dinner together

648
00:40:30,884 --> 00:40:33,604
I quickly digest anything I eat these days
so it's okay

649
00:40:34,623 --> 00:40:35,610
Oh right

650
00:40:36,751 --> 00:40:38,232
It looked like Hwan's father

651
00:40:38,234 --> 00:40:39,866
is also not coming today

652
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:42,373
I guess being rich isn't all that

653
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:43,288
Well

654
00:40:43,289 --> 00:40:46,482
my dad did tell me that being rich
doesn't make you a happy family

655
00:40:47,534 --> 00:40:48,960
Being rich...

656
00:40:48,962 --> 00:40:50,848
might make you less miserable though

657
00:40:57,842 --> 00:40:59,671
Argh, why is my stomach hurting?

658
00:41:00,695 --> 00:41:01,983
Did I have too much?

659
00:41:01,985 --> 00:41:03,647
You did eat in a hurry

660
00:41:04,122 --> 00:41:05,551
You want me to get you a Coke?

661
00:41:05,552 --> 00:41:07,260
I can prick your finger if you're feeling sick

662
00:41:11,439 --> 00:41:12,527
Come over here

663
00:41:12,755 --> 00:41:14,107
I'll prick your finger

664
00:41:15,402 --> 00:41:16,492
No

665
00:41:16,494 --> 00:41:18,088
I saw this on a medical drama

666
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:19,721
- You have to cut off your finger
- No

667
00:41:20,041 --> 00:41:21,404
I think I'm fine now

668
00:41:21,406 --> 00:41:23,104
Don't storage rooms have electric saws?

669
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:25,588
There must be one inside over there. Have a look

670
00:41:25,589 --> 00:41:26,921
Oh, really? Let's take a look

671
00:41:27,042 --> 00:41:28,289
Hey, guys

672
00:41:28,865 --> 00:41:30,432
I don't...

673
00:41:30,433 --> 00:41:31,628
Get him!

674
00:41:56,538 --> 00:41:58,280
Having fun?

675
00:42:00,301 --> 00:42:03,168
I told you to clean up this place, not goof around

676
00:42:04,818 --> 00:42:05,975
Oh, look

677
00:42:06,874 --> 00:42:09,014
Don't you guys attend junior high?

678
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:10,768
Huh?

679
00:42:10,939 --> 00:42:11,990
These kids

680
00:42:11,991 --> 00:42:13,728
Who told you you could come here?

681
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:14,655
Huh?

682
00:42:15,888 --> 00:42:16,940
Haru Park

683
00:42:16,942 --> 00:42:17,809
Jeha Jeon

684
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:19,803
I got your names now

685
00:42:19,804 --> 00:42:22,531
I'm going to talk to
your school disciplinarian, understood?

686
00:42:22,532 --> 00:42:23,802
But, sir

687
00:42:26,032 --> 00:42:27,570
Where's Dogeon?

688
00:42:28,765 --> 00:42:30,029
He left for the parent-teacher meeting

689
00:42:30,288 --> 00:42:31,506
His mother came

690
00:42:33,228 --> 00:42:35,019
Dogeon is a thoughtful kid

691
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:37,626
I was worried that he wouldn't tell you
since you're busy

692
00:42:37,627 --> 00:42:39,303
That's why I made the call

693
00:42:40,139 --> 00:42:43,466
There's also something I wish to discuss

694
00:42:45,473 --> 00:42:47,186
I must come, of course

695
00:42:48,394 --> 00:42:50,494
You might already know

696
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:52,202
but Dogeon is a smart kid

697
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:55,083
His grades for the mock exam are excellent as well

698
00:42:56,986 --> 00:42:58,250
But lately...

699
00:42:58,252 --> 00:43:01,050
I heard he's working part-time

700
00:43:01,052 --> 00:43:03,079
both on weekdays and weekends

701
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:05,826
Ah, yes

702
00:43:06,715 --> 00:43:09,639
His father is ill

703
00:43:10,617 --> 00:43:12,477
Yes, I'm aware of that

704
00:43:14,335 --> 00:43:15,420
so

705
00:43:16,388 --> 00:43:18,252
instead of working part-time,

706
00:43:18,253 --> 00:43:20,413
to let him concentrate on his studies,

707
00:43:20,415 --> 00:43:23,739
how about applying for a scholarship program?

708
00:43:24,531 --> 00:43:25,323
One moment

709
00:43:27,467 --> 00:43:28,912
Did you get a scholarship?

710
00:43:29,531 --> 00:43:31,772
Wow, well done. Well done, my son

711
00:43:33,313 --> 00:43:35,369
SONGHO SCHOLARSHIP GUIDE

712
00:43:36,005 --> 00:43:37,464
But...

713
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:40,990
as this program is provided
to support his studies,

714
00:43:41,798 --> 00:43:44,320
once he gets the scholarship,

715
00:43:44,321 --> 00:43:46,806
Dogeon may have to quit his part-time jobs

716
00:43:47,817 --> 00:43:52,313
Will you be able to support him?

717
00:44:02,833 --> 00:44:03,875
Yes

718
00:44:04,437 --> 00:44:05,781
I must

719
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,308
I have to let him study, of course

720
00:44:21,946 --> 00:44:23,509
So you can't work...

721
00:44:25,150 --> 00:44:27,916
after getting the scholarship?

722
00:44:31,241 --> 00:44:34,560
How should we pay for the living expenses

723
00:44:34,561 --> 00:44:35,938
and your father's hospital bills?

724
00:44:39,614 --> 00:44:40,842
It's obvious

725
00:44:41,658 --> 00:44:43,449
I should keep on working part-time

726
00:44:45,308 --> 00:44:46,788
She said you can't

727
00:44:52,793 --> 00:44:54,916
Are you really asking for my sake?

728
00:44:56,468 --> 00:44:58,181
If I quit all my part-time jobs,

729
00:44:58,734 --> 00:45:00,070
do you have any other plans?

730
00:45:02,641 --> 00:45:03,907
For now,

731
00:45:04,194 --> 00:45:06,798
just until I get a job, you...

732
00:45:07,263 --> 00:45:09,922
who else is there in our family?

733
00:45:13,825 --> 00:45:14,820
Mom,

734
00:45:17,138 --> 00:45:19,568
it's my dream to live a normal life

735
00:45:22,453 --> 00:45:23,837
Like watching TV together

736
00:45:23,838 --> 00:45:26,573
when I get home after school

737
00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:30,471
and having dinner together in the evening

738
00:45:32,234 --> 00:45:33,535
and at night,

739
00:45:34,914 --> 00:45:37,031
falling asleep on a comfy bed

740
00:45:38,691 --> 00:45:40,179
A normal life...

741
00:45:43,687 --> 00:45:45,276
But why is it so difficult...

742
00:45:45,934 --> 00:45:47,624
for me to lead a normal life?

743
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:58,153
Go

744
00:45:59,457 --> 00:46:00,928
I'll call you later

745
00:46:20,023 --> 00:46:21,836
Things don't look so good

746
00:46:23,336 --> 00:46:25,584
He does all the heavy lifting in his family

747
00:46:31,154 --> 00:46:32,814
Huh? What?

748
00:46:37,442 --> 00:46:38,872
Dad!

749
00:46:39,987 --> 00:46:41,359
How come you're here?

750
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:42,450
What are you doing here?

751
00:46:42,451 --> 00:46:44,615
- In a suit!
- Let go

752
00:46:45,709 --> 00:46:47,328
Explain yourself

753
00:46:47,602 --> 00:46:49,649
Why didn't you tell me
about the parent-teacher meeting today?

754
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:53,360
Because you're drunk all the time

755
00:46:53,762 --> 00:46:55,093
Unbelievable

756
00:46:55,970 --> 00:46:57,066
What are you doing?

757
00:46:57,179 --> 00:46:59,014
- What?
- You didn't drink today

758
00:47:00,341 --> 00:47:02,145
How could I drink before a school meeting?

759
00:47:02,146 --> 00:47:04,518
What should I do with you, honestly

760
00:47:04,711 --> 00:47:06,474
Don't I look good today?

761
00:47:06,476 --> 00:47:07,616
- What do you think?
- Oh, no

762
00:47:07,617 --> 00:47:09,843
- What?
- Oh, no because you look too nice

763
00:47:09,845 --> 00:47:11,235
This kid

764
00:47:12,731 --> 00:47:15,057
- Oh, here
- Yes, here

765
00:47:20,002 --> 00:47:21,034
Hosu

766
00:47:21,247 --> 00:47:23,219
Your mother's in the teacher's office

767
00:47:23,555 --> 00:47:24,923
My mother?

768
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:40,217
I can't thank you enough

769
00:47:41,476 --> 00:47:42,564
Huh? Hosu

770
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:45,727
Hosu

771
00:47:46,578 --> 00:47:47,735
Oh, Mrs. Kim

772
00:47:54,110 --> 00:47:56,089
I thought you wouldn't come

773
00:47:56,091 --> 00:47:57,805
since you have to visit other schools

774
00:47:58,236 --> 00:48:00,154
Of course, I came

775
00:48:00,155 --> 00:48:01,998
you're one of my precious children

776
00:48:02,855 --> 00:48:04,099
Did you have lunch?

777
00:48:04,101 --> 00:48:05,321
I had tteokbokki earlier

778
00:48:05,322 --> 00:48:06,802
- Huh?
- Cein treated us

779
00:48:10,268 --> 00:48:11,723
Oh, Haru

780
00:48:16,386 --> 00:48:17,653
Who's this?

781
00:48:18,075 --> 00:48:20,393
He always walks home with me

782
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:23,460
Hello

783
00:48:23,596 --> 00:48:25,379
Oh, hi

784
00:48:28,434 --> 00:48:29,542
Let's go

785
00:48:38,105 --> 00:48:39,154
Who was that?

786
00:48:39,278 --> 00:48:40,835
That's...

787
00:48:41,268 --> 00:48:43,828
the kid who likes me so much
that he transferred to this school

788
00:48:44,295 --> 00:48:45,461
He also likes to dance

789
00:48:45,462 --> 00:48:46,567
Oh, really?

790
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:49,668
He's cute

791
00:48:52,765 --> 00:48:55,281
You didn't tell him, did you?

792
00:48:58,923 --> 00:49:00,147
Never

793
00:49:00,916 --> 00:49:03,362
You know you should never tell him, right?

794
00:49:04,482 --> 00:49:05,507
Yes

795
00:49:08,470 --> 00:49:09,433
Okay

796
00:49:10,505 --> 00:49:11,915
I'll get going

797
00:49:30,707 --> 00:49:32,059
Seriously

798
00:49:32,433 --> 00:49:34,210
I'm telling you I'm right

799
00:49:34,212 --> 00:49:35,526
Ah, yes

800
00:49:36,506 --> 00:49:39,704
I'm really sorry, but I don't think...

801
00:49:40,288 --> 00:49:42,029
I can make the transaction today

802
00:49:43,997 --> 00:49:46,147
The bike suddenly disappeared

803
00:49:47,499 --> 00:49:48,614
Yes

804
00:49:50,635 --> 00:49:52,306
I'll call you right away

805
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:54,869
I'm sorry

806
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:57,706
I'm telling you, it's Hwan Kim!

807
00:49:59,571 --> 00:50:01,625
Hwan stole your bike

808
00:50:01,626 --> 00:50:02,997
No way

809
00:50:03,842 --> 00:50:05,144
Then who?

810
00:50:05,285 --> 00:50:07,683
It was here until lunchtime.
Where can it go?

811
00:50:07,813 --> 00:50:09,193
I'm telling you, it's Hwan

812
00:50:09,613 --> 00:50:11,386
Let's go to his house

813
00:50:11,388 --> 00:50:12,886
I have to go to work

814
00:50:13,986 --> 00:50:15,130
You

815
00:50:15,883 --> 00:50:17,463
Don't you get what's more important here?

816
00:50:17,465 --> 00:50:20,953
- How are you going to settle?
- My work is also important

817
00:50:22,670 --> 00:50:24,042
I have to make money...

818
00:50:25,179 --> 00:50:26,304
to settle

819
00:50:31,676 --> 00:50:33,318
Dogeon!

820
00:50:37,381 --> 00:50:38,957
Darn it

821
00:50:42,861 --> 00:50:45,128
If we're getting the bike, we have to get it quickly

822
00:50:45,793 --> 00:50:48,789
If I had a stolen bike
I would sell it off for cash

823
00:50:49,852 --> 00:50:52,691
Also, you'd be easily caught
riding that bike

824
00:50:56,501 --> 00:50:57,622
What are you going to do?

825
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,494
Are you going to look for it?

826
00:51:00,438 --> 00:51:01,857
You want us to help?

827
00:51:02,171 --> 00:51:03,161
No

828
00:51:03,264 --> 00:51:04,953
It's not mine, anyway

829
00:51:06,948 --> 00:51:08,798
The owner left for work

830
00:51:08,799 --> 00:51:10,976
and he doesn't even believe me

831
00:51:15,054 --> 00:51:16,606
Hey Jooan, that hurt

832
00:51:17,809 --> 00:51:19,363
I said that hurt!

833
00:51:19,809 --> 00:51:21,311
Haru, why...

834
00:51:24,983 --> 00:51:27,358
Weren't you going home
with your parents?

835
00:51:27,477 --> 00:51:29,938
I told her to go so I can go with you

836
00:51:31,511 --> 00:51:32,471
Let's go

837
00:51:32,655 --> 00:51:33,583
Let's go

838
00:51:37,721 --> 00:51:38,873
Let's go

839
00:51:39,117 --> 00:51:40,458
We'll get going

840
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:42,925
Goodbye

841
00:51:48,937 --> 00:51:51,026
Your mother is really pretty

842
00:51:51,264 --> 00:51:52,678
She looks like you

843
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:56,034
I was more jealous of you

844
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:58,300
You looked close with your mom

845
00:51:58,864 --> 00:51:59,767
Huh?

846
00:52:01,779 --> 00:52:02,682
She's not my mom

847
00:52:02,683 --> 00:52:04,315
She's the lady from my orphanage

848
00:52:07,264 --> 00:52:08,931
You didn't know?

849
00:52:11,159 --> 00:52:12,386
I live in an orphanage

850
00:52:12,388 --> 00:52:13,787
I don't have any parents

851
00:52:19,041 --> 00:52:19,979
It's weird

852
00:52:20,913 --> 00:52:23,373
Everyone reacts this way
every time I bring this up

853
00:52:23,749 --> 00:52:24,980
I'm fine, really

854
00:52:27,162 --> 00:52:29,231
My mom would've had her reasons

855
00:52:31,765 --> 00:52:33,951
I was so freaking cute when I was young

856
00:52:34,352 --> 00:52:36,389
I bet she had no choice
when she left me

857
00:52:38,367 --> 00:52:39,648
Oh, I almost forgot

858
00:52:40,197 --> 00:52:43,379
I found a shortcut to your house

859
00:52:43,745 --> 00:52:44,862
A shortcut?

860
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:46,329
Here

861
00:52:46,454 --> 00:52:48,077
You see the Grass Flower Arboretum here?

862
00:52:48,855 --> 00:52:49,892
If you take this path,

863
00:52:49,893 --> 00:52:51,580
you reach your home in 30 minutes

864
00:52:52,719 --> 00:52:55,275
We always took the detour like idiots

865
00:52:56,338 --> 00:52:57,262
Look

866
00:52:57,553 --> 00:52:59,021
Here's the local police office

867
00:52:59,115 --> 00:53:00,808
Go a little further from here
and it's the arboretum

868
00:53:06,017 --> 00:53:07,058
Dogeon

869
00:53:07,448 --> 00:53:09,014
- Oh, yes
- This is for the Red Room

870
00:53:09,016 --> 00:53:10,095
- The Red Room?
- Yes

871
00:53:14,554 --> 00:53:16,028
Here's your order

872
00:53:21,881 --> 00:53:22,925
Huh?

873
00:53:28,204 --> 00:53:29,355
Who's this?

874
00:53:29,567 --> 00:53:30,918
Is he your friend?

875
00:53:31,782 --> 00:53:33,310
He's from our school

876
00:53:33,312 --> 00:53:35,133
He's one of the smartest in the region

877
00:53:37,109 --> 00:53:38,630
Didn't know he worked here

878
00:53:39,697 --> 00:53:40,656
Hello

879
00:53:42,011 --> 00:53:43,309
How amazing

880
00:53:43,334 --> 00:53:45,665
You get good grades
and work at the same time

881
00:53:46,608 --> 00:53:48,450
Mingook, eat up

882
00:53:49,027 --> 00:53:50,886
You're getting thin lately

883
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:52,462
Ah, yes

884
00:54:52,859 --> 00:54:53,877
Welcome

885
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,515
What took you so long?

886
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:57,775
How much should I fill?

887
00:54:57,776 --> 00:54:59,004
- Make it full
- Okay

888
00:55:26,398 --> 00:55:27,560
Throw this away for me

889
00:55:27,815 --> 00:55:29,100
Okay

890
00:55:38,524 --> 00:55:39,498
Here you go

891
00:55:49,094 --> 00:55:50,680
That will be 93,000 won

892
00:55:56,508 --> 00:55:57,786
Yes, here it is

893
00:55:58,263 --> 00:55:59,223
Come again

894
00:56:08,952 --> 00:56:10,083
Dogeon

895
00:56:10,462 --> 00:56:11,687
I found the bike

896
00:56:18,788 --> 00:56:19,787
Look

897
00:56:20,131 --> 00:56:21,891
This is yours. The one with the chafed saddle

898
00:56:22,402 --> 00:56:23,854
I told you he stole it

899
00:56:31,237 --> 00:56:32,821
I told you I was right

900
00:56:32,946 --> 00:56:33,771
I told you multiple times

901
00:56:33,772 --> 00:56:34,896
that Hwan Kim stole it

902
00:56:35,275 --> 00:56:36,542
And no one believed me

903
00:56:36,750 --> 00:56:37,319
See?

904
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:40,073
We found the bike at his place

905
00:56:40,833 --> 00:56:41,718
Why...

906
00:56:42,503 --> 00:56:43,504
would Hwan...

907
00:56:43,665 --> 00:56:44,792
I don't care about his reasons

908
00:56:44,906 --> 00:56:45,947
Forget it

909
00:56:45,977 --> 00:56:46,752
It's ours

910
00:56:46,753 --> 00:56:48,100
so I'm taking it with us

911
00:56:52,178 --> 00:56:54,441
He even chained it
after stealing it from us

912
00:56:55,978 --> 00:56:56,772
Hey

913
00:56:56,774 --> 00:56:57,979
Hey, Jooan

914
00:56:59,099 --> 00:57:00,045
Jooan

915
00:57:00,047 --> 00:57:01,720
That wouldn't work

916
00:57:03,567 --> 00:57:04,972
What do you think you are doing?

917
00:57:05,165 --> 00:57:06,454
Leave the bike

918
00:57:09,981 --> 00:57:11,002
Hey, Hwan

919
00:57:13,617 --> 00:57:14,595
Hwan

920
00:57:15,294 --> 00:57:17,402
- About this bike...
- That's mine

921
00:57:19,259 --> 00:57:20,713
The one you guys stole

922
00:57:21,289 --> 00:57:22,439
I took it back

923
00:57:22,733 --> 00:57:24,002
You stole his bike?

924
00:57:24,075 --> 00:57:25,786
- These thieving rats
- Nope!

925
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:27,546
It's Dogeon's!

926
00:57:27,637 --> 00:57:28,972
Do you know how much that is?

927
00:57:29,068 --> 00:57:30,951
How would guys like you afford that?

928
00:57:31,965 --> 00:57:34,283
If you're poor, at least lead an honest life

929
00:57:34,285 --> 00:57:35,215
If you waste your life

930
00:57:35,216 --> 00:57:37,092
you only end up like your parents

931
00:57:37,608 --> 00:57:39,381
- Hey, mister
- Mister?

932
00:57:39,847 --> 00:57:41,077
Should I call the police?

933
00:57:46,934 --> 00:57:47,938
Let's go

934
00:57:54,506 --> 00:57:55,505
Go where?

935
00:57:57,525 --> 00:57:58,675
Where are you going?

936
00:57:59,370 --> 00:58:00,832
They tried to steal it and sell it off

937
00:58:01,792 --> 00:58:03,368
Kids these days are scary

938
00:58:05,822 --> 00:58:07,156
What are you looking at?

939
00:58:35,462 --> 00:58:36,762
You are selling the bike, right?

940
00:58:37,428 --> 00:58:38,844
How about a fast deal?

941
00:58:39,560 --> 00:58:41,531
I'm telling you, rich kids are different

942
00:58:42,076 --> 00:58:44,333
Thanks to that Hwan Kim
we'll make some money

943
00:58:44,335 --> 00:58:45,324
Hey

944
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:47,242
Someone's coming

945
00:59:01,045 --> 00:59:01,984
You guys

946
00:59:02,722 --> 00:59:04,177
Where did you get that bike?

947
00:59:05,614 --> 00:59:06,712
You guys stole it, right?

948
00:59:09,690 --> 00:59:10,631
So,

949
00:59:11,783 --> 00:59:12,730
you're not buying it?

950
00:59:12,732 --> 00:59:14,354
You'd better answer me

951
00:59:17,174 --> 00:59:18,453
You guys stole it, right?

952
00:59:21,423 --> 00:59:23,798
With the camcorder and all, it must be

953
00:59:24,902 --> 00:59:26,109
You stole it

954
00:59:27,873 --> 00:59:29,420
What the

955
00:59:32,681 --> 00:59:33,739
Hey

956
00:59:34,391 --> 00:59:35,339
Isn't he that guy?

957
00:59:35,455 --> 00:59:36,309
Yeah

958
00:59:36,755 --> 00:59:37,857
That psychopath

959
00:59:38,578 --> 00:59:40,242
The one who burned his mother alive

960
00:59:41,668 --> 00:59:42,714
Really?

961
00:59:43,607 --> 00:59:45,662
That you sneaked sleeping pills to kill her?

962
00:59:57,600 --> 00:59:58,313
Why?

963
00:59:59,378 --> 01:00:00,482
You want to know?

964
01:00:01,538 --> 01:00:02,931
Want me to tell you?

965
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:08,531
Why bother to use sleeping pills?

966
01:00:10,586 --> 01:00:12,048
I used a syringe,

967
01:00:12,686 --> 01:00:13,900
to put her down completely

968
01:00:18,562 --> 01:00:19,734
Someone's here looking for you

969
01:00:20,686 --> 01:00:21,663
Who?

970
01:00:21,883 --> 01:00:22,966
Well

971
01:00:49,375 --> 01:00:50,881
This is your bike, right?

972
01:00:52,359 --> 01:00:54,281
That's Dogeon's, and this is yours

973
01:00:54,504 --> 01:00:55,644
Look closely

974
01:00:58,016 --> 01:01:00,273
The camcorder that went missing together,

975
01:01:01,069 --> 01:01:02,199
must be this

976
01:01:12,817 --> 01:01:14,367
We are not who you think we are

977
01:01:19,056 --> 01:01:20,893
What do you mean?

978
01:01:22,273 --> 01:01:23,613
The kind of people...

979
01:01:25,344 --> 01:01:26,480
that you're picturing

980
01:02:02,632 --> 01:02:03,647
Hey

981
01:02:04,869 --> 01:02:05,959
Hey!

982
01:02:07,287 --> 01:02:08,995
I can't pay you if you work like this

983
01:02:09,484 --> 01:02:10,506
Why?

984
01:02:10,768 --> 01:02:13,053
Where were you
last night and two nights ago?

985
01:02:14,535 --> 01:02:16,089
I went for another job

986
01:02:16,750 --> 01:02:18,747
I thought so, so I secretly came by

987
01:02:18,748 --> 01:02:20,487
You weren't here
Dogeon. No answer

988
01:02:20,488 --> 01:02:22,714
Dogeon! I shouted multiple times, but still no answer!

989
01:02:22,918 --> 01:02:23,845
Are you out of your mind?

990
01:02:24,804 --> 01:02:27,571
I looked out for you,
and got you this job

991
01:02:27,858 --> 01:02:28,882
I mean

992
01:02:29,220 --> 01:02:32,392
who would pay you
just for keeping your post?

993
01:02:32,893 --> 01:02:33,541
Huh?

994
01:02:33,791 --> 01:02:34,568
It doesn't have to be you

995
01:02:34,569 --> 01:02:36,359
People are lining up for this job!

996
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:37,742
Quit it, then!

997
01:02:38,941 --> 01:02:41,019
I'm sorry

998
01:02:43,493 --> 01:02:45,157
Even without you,

999
01:02:45,686 --> 01:02:46,866
I can't sleep

1000
01:02:46,867 --> 01:02:48,489
because of people who're after this place

1001
01:02:49,610 --> 01:02:50,627
Don't you want this job?

1002
01:02:50,629 --> 01:02:51,919
I'm sorry

1003
01:02:52,611 --> 01:02:53,764
This won't happen again

1004
01:02:55,462 --> 01:02:56,790
I'll stop by frequently

1005
01:02:56,791 --> 01:02:57,749
Dogeon

1006
01:02:58,009 --> 01:02:59,913
- I'm telling you, I'll stop by frequently
- Okay

1007
01:03:00,218 --> 01:03:01,423
Be careful

1008
01:03:02,078 --> 01:03:02,713
Okay

1009
01:03:02,714 --> 01:03:03,945
I don't even know how many times
I go back and forth

1010
01:03:03,946 --> 01:03:05,209
I'm sorry

1011
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:07,228
- I'm sorry
- I can't sleep because of you

1012
01:03:32,643 --> 01:03:33,646
Hwan

1013
01:03:34,747 --> 01:03:36,150
When did you get here?

1014
01:03:40,308 --> 01:03:40,921
I...

1015
01:03:45,265 --> 01:03:46,417
I came because of this

1016
01:04:02,676 --> 01:04:03,671
I'm sorry

1017
01:04:07,865 --> 01:04:09,160
I got it wrong

1018
01:04:10,257 --> 01:04:11,371
I'm really sorry

1019
01:04:13,774 --> 01:04:15,130
The bike...

1020
01:04:20,449 --> 01:04:21,567
and this, too

1021
01:04:27,540 --> 01:04:28,856
Oh, thank God

1022
01:04:29,292 --> 01:04:31,479
I did drop it in your house

1023
01:04:31,867 --> 01:04:34,230
I was worried
I might have dropped it on the street

1024
01:04:34,978 --> 01:04:36,487
Thank God

1025
01:04:44,304 --> 01:04:45,683
Me too. I got you wrong

1026
01:04:47,797 --> 01:04:49,017
To tell you the truth,

1027
01:04:49,381 --> 01:04:51,671
Cein called and told me
that he found the bike

1028
01:04:52,851 --> 01:04:54,673
and there must've been a misunderstanding

1029
01:04:55,824 --> 01:04:56,593
That you must've had...

1030
01:04:57,732 --> 01:04:59,255
your reasons, too

1031
01:05:02,203 --> 01:05:03,132
But...

1032
01:05:04,679 --> 01:05:06,680
I didn't expect you to come here to apologize

1033
01:05:08,423 --> 01:05:10,554
I thought you wouldn't acknowledge your mistake

1034
01:05:11,205 --> 01:05:12,840
and let it slide

1035
01:05:14,316 --> 01:05:16,253
I thought you would ignore it

1036
01:05:16,255 --> 01:05:17,781
like the other people I know

1037
01:05:22,069 --> 01:05:23,323
I'm sorry, too

1038
01:05:34,903 --> 01:05:36,235
Did you have dinner?

1039
01:05:36,610 --> 01:05:38,071
If you didn't

1040
01:05:38,073 --> 01:05:39,924
- Let's go to the convenience store togeth...
- I had dinner

1041
01:05:39,954 --> 01:05:40,564
Oh

1042
01:05:41,608 --> 01:05:42,832
you already did

1043
01:05:43,487 --> 01:05:44,462
But...

1044
01:05:44,922 --> 01:05:46,173
I still want to go with you

1045
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:49,358
Okay

1046
01:05:49,463 --> 01:05:50,443
Oh, Hwan

1047
01:05:50,594 --> 01:05:51,651
Wait

1048
01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:53,903
- I'll just get my phone
- Okay

1049
01:05:58,984 --> 01:06:00,257
Ah, this...

1050
01:06:03,582 --> 01:06:05,332
This happens all the time

1051
01:06:05,756 --> 01:06:07,665
I break things whenever I touch something

1052
01:06:07,832 --> 01:06:08,887
They call me "Dolk"

1053
01:06:09,399 --> 01:06:11,310
It's a combination of Dogeon and "Hulk"

1054
01:06:16,522 --> 01:06:17,577
You can take this

1055
01:06:19,402 --> 01:06:20,266
Sorry?

1056
01:06:21,016 --> 01:06:21,844
Huh?

1057
01:06:29,904 --> 01:06:30,925
I'm sorry

1058
01:06:31,117 --> 01:06:32,559
I thought you owned that bike

1059
01:06:33,097 --> 01:06:34,099
Don't worry

1060
01:06:34,101 --> 01:06:35,503
It might come to use someday

1061
01:06:36,501 --> 01:06:39,636
No law says
I shouldn't get a bike like that

1062
01:06:40,546 --> 01:06:42,243
Thank you for the lock

1063
01:06:42,244 --> 01:06:43,200
I'll use it well

1064
01:06:45,430 --> 01:06:46,965
Keep to the pedestrian

1065
01:06:46,966 --> 01:06:48,098
Don't walk on the road

1066
01:06:48,379 --> 01:06:49,467
Hey!

1067
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:52,215
Get inside

1068
01:06:52,375 --> 01:06:53,452
Oh, Hwan

1069
01:06:55,661 --> 01:06:56,734
Had your breakfast?

1070
01:07:00,017 --> 01:07:01,421
Come inside, onto the pedestrian

1071
01:07:01,422 --> 01:07:02,734
Don't walk on the road

1072
01:07:03,597 --> 01:07:04,998
I said walk on the pedestrian

1073
01:07:09,019 --> 01:07:09,947
Where's your greeting?

1074
01:07:09,949 --> 01:07:11,371
- Hello
- Hello

1075
01:07:12,613 --> 01:07:14,762
Don't run and come inside

1076
01:07:16,464 --> 01:07:18,492
Keep to the pedestrian!

1077
01:07:18,494 --> 01:07:19,210
Pedestrian!

1078
01:07:22,646 --> 01:07:24,181
Hey, Hwan Kim

1079
01:07:25,644 --> 01:07:26,985
Why are you standing there?

1080
01:07:26,993 --> 01:07:28,636
Get inside. Go study

1081
01:07:29,864 --> 01:07:31,616
I'll receive detention with them

1082
01:07:33,493 --> 01:07:34,594
Why?

1083
01:07:35,501 --> 01:07:37,224
It was my fault as much as theirs

1084
01:07:45,681 --> 01:07:46,884
Wait here for a while

1085
01:08:45,866 --> 01:08:46,908
Hosu

1086
01:08:48,452 --> 01:08:50,198
Let's just take the same route

1087
01:08:50,966 --> 01:08:52,049
Why?

1088
01:08:52,836 --> 01:08:55,203
You can get home more quickly
by taking the arboretum route

1089
01:08:58,348 --> 01:09:00,580
GRASS FLOWER ARBORETUM

1090
01:09:06,046 --> 01:09:07,479
Okay, let's go

1091
01:09:09,227 --> 01:09:10,680
I'm sorry

1092
01:09:12,488 --> 01:09:14,522
I guess you want to spend
as much time with me as possible

1093
01:09:17,394 --> 01:09:18,555
Let's go

1094
01:09:20,694 --> 01:09:22,747
You've got nice dance moves

1095
01:09:23,497 --> 01:09:24,474
Hosu

1096
01:09:24,522 --> 01:09:26,222
This is a really nice shot, isn't it?

1097
01:09:26,336 --> 01:09:28,082
It's like watching a music program

1098
01:09:28,176 --> 01:09:29,539
The camera movement

1099
01:09:29,644 --> 01:09:32,100
Honestly, the camera movements did all the work

1100
01:09:32,607 --> 01:09:34,044
Agreed?

1101
01:09:36,403 --> 01:09:37,326
Right?

1102
01:09:43,490 --> 01:09:44,917
Hosu!
