00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,300
This series is based on a fictionalized story inspired by the story of BTS's album,
The Most Beautiful Moment in Life,
and is not related to BTS members and their families.

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,300
Child actors and animals were filmed
in safe conditions under the supervision of their guardians.

3
00:00:27,328 --> 00:00:28,516
Not yet

4
00:00:31,736 --> 00:00:35,467
Ah, but honestly, I'm not really
good at this kind of thing...

5
00:00:38,961 --> 00:00:40,214
Alright

6
00:00:42,218 --> 00:00:44,019
Is this really the only thing I should do?

7
00:00:45,016 --> 00:00:46,160
Promise me

8
00:01:41,771 --> 00:01:42,975
Hey...

9
00:01:43,685 --> 00:01:45,075
What time is it now?

10
00:01:50,368 --> 00:01:51,661
You can check from that thing

11
00:01:53,167 --> 00:01:55,571
Ah, right

12
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:57,435
You're right

13
00:01:59,413 --> 00:02:00,545
Hey, Bro!

14
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:02,890
Bro?

15
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:04,573
You know me?

16
00:02:06,565 --> 00:02:09,190
No, it's just that you seem
older than me at a glance...

17
00:02:14,258 --> 00:02:16,896
Ah, I was about to go
to the pharmacy too...

18
00:02:16,897 --> 00:02:18,489
How did you know I was
going to the pharmacy?

19
00:02:21,882 --> 00:02:23,032
You...

20
00:02:24,415 --> 00:02:25,505
What are you?

21
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:31,269
I just thought you were
heading to the pharmacy...

22
00:02:31,966 --> 00:02:33,194
Who are you?

23
00:02:33,998 --> 00:02:35,223
Jeez...

24
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:49,272
Ah, I really can't do these things.
Don't know why they asked for me such weird stuff...

25
00:03:22,713 --> 00:03:24,398
- Haru!
- What the...

26
00:03:29,963 --> 00:03:31,188
Haru!

27
00:03:41,309 --> 00:03:42,605
What's going on?

28
00:03:42,606 --> 00:03:44,400
Those two had a fight?
What's up with him?

29
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:46,155
You try to stop them

30
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,089
You're the smartest one here

31
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:52,946
Since when does being smart
relate to stopping a fight?

32
00:03:52,947 --> 00:03:54,044
Hey, Guys

33
00:03:55,203 --> 00:03:56,236
Hey, Hwan

34
00:03:58,304 --> 00:03:59,542
Where have you been?

35
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:03,008
- Ah, I had some things to do...
- Jooan

36
00:04:05,689 --> 00:04:06,805
Eh?

37
00:04:08,285 --> 00:04:09,461
Dad!

38
00:04:12,371 --> 00:04:14,215
Oh, are you here to pick me up?

39
00:04:17,486 --> 00:04:19,503
You met them too, right?

40
00:04:19,908 --> 00:04:21,226
Where’s your mom and sister!

41
00:04:25,845 --> 00:04:27,068
Your mom left me

42
00:04:27,656 --> 00:04:28,905
and now you three
plan to live together?

43
00:04:28,906 --> 00:04:30,418
Huh? Tell me!

44
00:04:30,918 --> 00:04:32,585
Get up, tell me!

45
00:04:32,586 --> 00:04:34,469
Come on, get up and talk!

46
00:04:34,876 --> 00:04:36,266
Say it, Jooan Kim!

47
00:04:36,267 --> 00:04:38,684
Hey, hey where are you going!

48
00:04:38,685 --> 00:04:40,465
Hey! Jooan Kim!

49
00:04:40,466 --> 00:04:42,559
- Stop right there! Let me go!
- Excuse me, sir!

50
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,958
- Sir, please
- Let me go!

51
00:04:44,765 --> 00:04:46,075
Stop right there!

52
00:04:46,473 --> 00:04:47,685
Jooan Kim!

53
00:04:47,957 --> 00:04:50,004
Ah, this little...!

54
00:04:50,005 --> 00:04:52,215
Let me go, Jooan Kim!

55
00:04:52,216 --> 00:04:53,704
Sir, please

56
00:04:53,705 --> 00:04:54,958
Calm down

57
00:05:20,605 --> 00:05:21,813
Huh?

58
00:05:23,653 --> 00:05:24,890
No, come on

59
00:05:29,191 --> 00:05:31,291
Boss goes crazy
if anyone is parked here...

60
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:46,764
Songho Scholarship Foundation
Wonjoong Byeon

61
00:05:46,766 --> 00:05:47,995
017?

62
00:05:49,345 --> 00:05:50,555
What kind of number is that?

63
00:05:58,536 --> 00:06:01,846
The number you've dialed is unavailable

64
00:06:03,445 --> 00:06:04,694
What the...

65
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:54,229
I'm sorry

66
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,096
Thank you

67
00:06:58,695 --> 00:06:59,869
What do you want?

68
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:01,481
Hello?

69
00:07:02,074 --> 00:07:04,051
- Why did you call?
- Where are you?

70
00:07:05,441 --> 00:07:07,544
Ignoring all my texts and what?

71
00:07:07,545 --> 00:07:08,947
Tell me where you are!

72
00:07:11,642 --> 00:07:12,750
No, I'm not going, I won't

73
00:07:12,751 --> 00:07:13,840
Just can't, no way

74
00:07:15,754 --> 00:07:17,941
I can't leave the container today

75
00:07:17,942 --> 00:07:19,533
So, where exactly are you?

76
00:07:44,303 --> 00:07:46,809
Wow, the air's so fresh here

77
00:07:51,702 --> 00:07:52,820
Tsk

78
00:07:54,217 --> 00:07:55,477
You said you wouldn't come

79
00:07:56,683 --> 00:07:58,181
Said you couldn't come, you liar

80
00:07:59,287 --> 00:08:01,782
Just here to get some fresh air

81
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:05,780
What air in this rain?

82
00:08:07,179 --> 00:08:08,183
Enjoy as much as you like

83
00:08:12,572 --> 00:08:13,746
Told you to come to the container...

84
00:08:18,369 --> 00:08:19,504
It's embarrassing

85
00:08:23,431 --> 00:08:25,956
You are not going home at all?

86
00:08:28,756 --> 00:08:30,859
Don't know, when I cool off

87
00:08:40,646 --> 00:08:43,391
Let's go to the container, okay?

88
00:08:44,886 --> 00:08:47,369
It's scary to be alone
in the container on a rainy day

89
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:49,987
Come on, hurry up

90
00:08:50,968 --> 00:08:53,893
- Hurry, hurry, hurry!
- Seriously

91
00:09:01,547 --> 00:09:02,864
Come on in

92
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,768
Hurry inside

93
00:09:10,189 --> 00:09:12,092
Just for you, you coward

94
00:09:12,782 --> 00:09:13,881
Thanks

95
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:21,934
You wear it, bro

96
00:09:21,935 --> 00:09:23,535
You wear it, you're all wet

97
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:27,133
- You're wet
- That's why you should wear it

98
00:09:32,016 --> 00:09:33,529
Don’t worry, I’ll take care of it

99
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,606
Hey, Cein Min, come over here

100
00:09:39,003 --> 00:09:40,803
What are you doing?
The principal is calling you

101
00:09:45,603 --> 00:09:47,807
Cein, can we talk for a moment?

102
00:10:00,762 --> 00:10:02,474
Hmm, this is really something...

103
00:10:05,258 --> 00:10:07,661
- What is going on?
- What do you mean by what?

104
00:10:09,856 --> 00:10:12,264
What's wrong with you? Get going!

105
00:10:19,857 --> 00:10:21,472
Ah...

106
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:24,510
Something feels off

107
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:27,689
It feels so awkward, why's that?

108
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:31,317
They’re only asking to stop
the detention, why feel weird about it?

109
00:10:31,318 --> 00:10:32,532
That's good then

110
00:10:34,118 --> 00:10:35,519
Haru's a bit late today, though

111
00:10:36,217 --> 00:10:37,599
What happened?

112
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,725
I heard Haru called in sick
with a cold today...

113
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,311
But is that true?

114
00:10:43,403 --> 00:10:45,436
Those comments...

115
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:48,202
Haru in a psychiatric hospital, that thing?

116
00:10:48,203 --> 00:10:49,380
Could that be true?

117
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:52,812
Typical of those hiding
to make up such stories

118
00:10:52,813 --> 00:10:55,417
Just writing fiction as they want,
a take it or leave it approach...

119
00:10:56,216 --> 00:10:59,988
- Whew
- But it’s not really a story yet...

120
00:11:02,354 --> 00:11:04,546
We should know this ourselves anyway

121
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,750
Haru is suffering a lot mentally

122
00:11:19,504 --> 00:11:21,784
Haru went through something tough before

123
00:11:23,284 --> 00:11:25,597
Because of that, it looks like Haru
received some psychiatric treatment

124
00:11:27,491 --> 00:11:30,580
Seems the situation got worse
because of the comments on my channel

125
00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:34,487
And so, started hearing hallucinations

126
00:11:36,299 --> 00:11:37,408
Something like that, I guess

127
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:54,731
Here it is

128
00:11:54,732 --> 00:11:56,126
- Is it all done?
- Yes

129
00:11:56,127 --> 00:11:58,447
- Let the boys do the self-study
- Alright, teacher

130
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:21,024
Oh, didn't know you were here

131
00:12:21,816 --> 00:12:23,015
Take it easy, relax

132
00:12:24,412 --> 00:12:25,615
It's all done

133
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:31,785
I can go out if you’re uncomfortable

134
00:12:32,783 --> 00:12:33,877
No

135
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:40,347
I appreciate your consideration, but...

136
00:12:42,343 --> 00:12:44,749
Sorry, but I can't do it

137
00:12:46,143 --> 00:12:47,543
What are you sorry for?

138
00:12:48,948 --> 00:12:52,550
Didn’t know caring for
an orchid was that difficult?

139
00:12:56,197 --> 00:12:57,964
It's not just an orchid

140
00:13:00,936 --> 00:13:02,222
It's just an orchid

141
00:13:03,133 --> 00:13:06,432
Still needs someone to look after

142
00:13:18,462 --> 00:13:19,763
Sorry, Sir

143
00:13:22,282 --> 00:13:25,582
Fine, if you’re not up for it

144
00:13:28,868 --> 00:13:30,466
Then, go back to the classroom

145
00:13:41,798 --> 00:13:42,953
Oh!

146
00:13:43,963 --> 00:13:45,467
Make sure to get ready for the final exam

147
00:13:45,972 --> 00:13:48,067
Your dad is probably expecting a lot

148
00:14:08,686 --> 00:14:10,288
It's me

149
00:14:10,677 --> 00:14:13,875
Could we have dinner tonight?

150
00:14:15,378 --> 00:14:17,688
It’d be better if Hwan joined us too

151
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:19,755
Please let me fill yours

152
00:14:25,471 --> 00:14:26,675
Are you okay?

153
00:14:28,093 --> 00:14:29,888
Hwan, you don't look well

154
00:14:32,688 --> 00:14:34,883
He's overly shy and timid

155
00:14:34,884 --> 00:14:35,975
Why do you say that?

156
00:14:36,832 --> 00:14:39,289
Just like when you were a student

157
00:14:41,654 --> 00:14:43,850
I'm trying to help out of care,

158
00:14:43,851 --> 00:14:46,850
and his awkward
response is exactly the same

159
00:14:49,549 --> 00:14:52,860
I wonder if I'm just doing
something unnecessary

160
00:14:54,786 --> 00:14:57,396
Not even looking up when the principal
is speaking, what sort of manner is that?

161
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,166
- I appreciate your words, but...
- See that?

162
00:15:03,965 --> 00:15:08,368
That’s why I feel like I'm just
doing something unnecessary. See?

163
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:13,381
He's been looking after me
since I was your age

164
00:15:14,165 --> 00:15:16,419
He made it possible for me to
be involved in politics like this

165
00:15:16,905 --> 00:15:18,405
All because of the principal’s guidance

166
00:15:20,716 --> 00:15:22,033
You should follow with appreciation

167
00:15:23,211 --> 00:15:24,293
If it’s because you feel sorry,

168
00:15:24,294 --> 00:15:26,621
do well enough as a way to give back

169
00:15:32,344 --> 00:15:34,130
- Kim Hwan
- Yes...

170
00:15:37,259 --> 00:15:38,717
Yes, sir

171
00:15:38,718 --> 00:15:40,306
Your father is absolutely right

172
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:44,036
I have no difference with your father

173
00:15:44,797 --> 00:15:47,334
We all treat Hwan in the same way

174
00:15:50,005 --> 00:15:54,206
How are the friends
you’ve been with recently?

175
00:15:55,695 --> 00:15:58,397
That might explain
his late nights lately

176
00:15:58,398 --> 00:15:59,693
I’m worried as well

177
00:15:59,694 --> 00:16:01,694
Everyone’s like that at this age, right?

178
00:16:02,092 --> 00:16:03,974
Think back to when you were a student

179
00:16:03,975 --> 00:16:06,173
Back then, together with friends,

180
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:09,661
sneaking around
doing bad stuff, wasn't it?

181
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:12,504
That’s right

182
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:16,938
But, I've come this far
without slipping, all thanks to you

183
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:22,868
Please take good care of Hwan too

184
00:16:23,673 --> 00:16:24,876
Don’t worry

185
00:16:27,463 --> 00:16:31,867
Looking after students is
my profession and mission

186
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:43,043
Yes, much better now

187
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:44,434
Fever's gone down today

188
00:16:45,734 --> 00:16:47,184
That's good

189
00:16:47,185 --> 00:16:50,186
You can't afford to be unwell
with your final exam soon

190
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:53,190
Mom, where's Sangmin?

191
00:16:54,307 --> 00:16:56,575
- Can I talk to him?
- Huh?

192
00:16:57,668 --> 00:17:00,612
Uh, he's taking a shower

193
00:17:00,613 --> 00:17:02,228
I'll ask him to call you after

194
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:04,427
You always say that
but never call back

195
00:17:05,211 --> 00:17:06,950
No

196
00:17:06,951 --> 00:17:09,899
It's just he's a bit
out of sorts and busy

197
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,306
Mom

198
00:17:13,558 --> 00:17:18,039
After the final exam is over and vacation begins,
do I need to go back to the hospital?

199
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,482
It just makes my mind go blank

200
00:17:23,031 --> 00:17:25,123
and I can't think at all...

201
00:17:26,307 --> 00:17:27,518
I really hate it there...

202
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:33,291
Okay, let's talk about it
when I get back to Korea

203
00:17:33,894 --> 00:17:35,076
Can you put Grandma on?

204
00:17:36,257 --> 00:17:37,307
Okay

205
00:17:57,859 --> 00:17:59,913
It is not fine at all

206
00:18:00,729 --> 00:18:03,337
He pretends to be fine because
he doesn't want to go to the hospital

207
00:18:04,318 --> 00:18:05,475
Whew

208
00:18:06,572 --> 00:18:11,574
Even today, he kept looking
around and scratching his ears

209
00:18:12,374 --> 00:18:14,549
hearing something all the time

210
00:18:15,749 --> 00:18:16,819
Sigh

211
00:18:17,538 --> 00:18:19,864
I'm so scared if others might see

212
00:18:21,381 --> 00:18:25,031
It's so bad that Sangmin asked
not to come to his graduation

213
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:27,620
Oh my lord

214
00:18:29,073 --> 00:18:30,419
My dear lord

215
00:18:52,233 --> 00:18:54,410
You're ashamed of me too, aren't you? Is that it?

216
00:18:54,411 --> 00:18:56,288
Everyone in my family is ashamed of me

217
00:18:56,289 --> 00:18:57,409
Because I'm crazy

218
00:18:57,891 --> 00:18:59,748
No one even tries to understand me

219
00:18:59,749 --> 00:19:01,162
How can this be a family?

220
00:19:14,716 --> 00:19:16,716
Send

221
00:19:16,717 --> 00:19:19,217
Mail Sent

222
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:30,954
I'm on my way to school

223
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:36,410
Trust me, I'm totally fine

224
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:45,418
What is it? What's wrong?

225
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:50,279
Trust me, sweetie

226
00:19:50,882 --> 00:19:52,588
You know I'm older than you?

227
00:19:52,589 --> 00:19:54,589
Why are you doing this? Just let me go

228
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:57,619
- Why? We are friends
- Friends!

229
00:19:59,209 --> 00:20:01,796
You are younger than me, agh!

230
00:20:01,797 --> 00:20:03,548
- Yo, let's go
- Where, where to?

231
00:20:03,549 --> 00:20:06,352
- Ouch, my armpit!
- Let's go!

232
00:20:17,582 --> 00:20:18,869
Wow, the weather is nice

233
00:20:19,726 --> 00:20:21,868
- The weather's good, isn't it?
- The weather's nice, right?

234
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,192
This is a bit... this isn't right!

235
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:30,726
- It's okay, it's okay
- No, it's not okay!

236
00:20:30,727 --> 00:20:32,412
You said it was very urgent

237
00:20:35,445 --> 00:20:37,297
What the heck, get off

238
00:20:42,938 --> 00:20:44,873
Haru, we'll be waiting for you

239
00:20:44,874 --> 00:20:46,473
- I'll wait
- Go away

240
00:20:47,873 --> 00:20:49,865
Have a good time

241
00:20:50,804 --> 00:20:52,535
Haru, what do you want to eat?

242
00:20:52,536 --> 00:20:53,871
What do you want to eat?

243
00:20:53,872 --> 00:20:56,033
- Is that him?
- Yeah, Munhyeon Middle School, crazy one

244
00:20:56,523 --> 00:20:58,194
- Right?
- The psychiatric hospital

245
00:21:01,298 --> 00:21:03,434
Oops, they don’t have it here

246
00:21:03,435 --> 00:21:04,573
Hey, let’s go out to eat

247
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:06,997
- Yeah, let's go out
- Go out

248
00:21:06,998 --> 00:21:08,396
I told you it hurts!

249
00:21:10,399 --> 00:21:11,936
What the heck, both of you

250
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,551
Why are you acting
like this all of a sudden!

251
00:21:18,639 --> 00:21:20,855
It's because of the rumors
about me, right? Isn't it?

252
00:21:21,652 --> 00:21:22,703
Huh?

253
00:21:24,203 --> 00:21:25,282
What are you talking about?

254
00:21:26,105 --> 00:21:30,205
It's because you are always sick
and catching colds, aren't you?

255
00:21:30,894 --> 00:21:31,916
Yes, me too

256
00:21:32,569 --> 00:21:35,584
You know, you tend to
fall over a lot when walking

257
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:36,593
That's why...

258
00:21:48,438 --> 00:21:51,354
For me, well, yeah

259
00:21:53,767 --> 00:21:55,981
It bothers me when one out of
every seven of us is missing

260
00:21:57,681 --> 00:21:59,380
I don't know why, but I just don't like it

261
00:22:01,931 --> 00:22:03,426
I hope we can be all together

262
00:22:05,928 --> 00:22:07,333
When we are all together,

263
00:22:08,735 --> 00:22:10,342
I don't even think about wanting to die

264
00:22:13,149 --> 00:22:14,335
Really, that's how it is

265
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:18,535
That's how it is

266
00:22:23,211 --> 00:22:26,813
Me too, just like that

267
00:22:45,112 --> 00:22:47,045
Hey, hey? Wait!

268
00:22:47,046 --> 00:22:49,407
This wasn't part of the plan, hold on!

269
00:22:49,408 --> 00:22:51,372
Ouch, armpit, agh!

270
00:22:51,373 --> 00:22:53,886
Ok, I'll behave

271
00:22:53,887 --> 00:22:55,275
Just let me down, now!

272
00:22:55,276 --> 00:22:56,708
I'm scared!

273
00:22:58,715 --> 00:23:00,116
Bro!

274
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:11,023
Hey, hey hey, hey!

275
00:23:12,399 --> 00:23:14,666
What are you guys up to,
sticking together again!

276
00:23:15,665 --> 00:23:17,051
No, sir

277
00:23:17,052 --> 00:23:19,442
We were just trying to continue
the detention after class, but then

278
00:23:20,249 --> 00:23:21,732
the door got locked

279
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,730
Talking about the school detention, huh?

280
00:23:23,731 --> 00:23:26,283
Meet up there, having fun,

281
00:23:26,284 --> 00:23:27,654
eating stuff you bought,
do you think I don't know?

282
00:23:28,054 --> 00:23:30,257
I never trusted you guys
from the beginning

283
00:23:30,258 --> 00:23:32,255
But we did clean up all the desks inside

284
00:23:32,256 --> 00:23:33,555
and removed all the cobwebs, you know?

285
00:23:34,928 --> 00:23:36,372
It's an order from the principal

286
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:39,653
Remaining detention will be replaced by

287
00:23:39,654 --> 00:23:41,759
picking up trash around,
instead of cleaning this place

288
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,656
Don't stick together, all of you

289
00:23:44,665 --> 00:23:46,226
- Dismissed!
- Why?

290
00:23:46,711 --> 00:23:47,984
Why the sudden change?

291
00:23:47,985 --> 00:23:49,813
You, why are you here after the principal said

292
00:23:49,814 --> 00:23:52,787
not to do any school detention?

293
00:23:53,372 --> 00:23:55,692
When told to do something,
you resist with all your might,

294
00:23:55,693 --> 00:23:57,221
and now when told not to, you make a fuss?

295
00:23:57,222 --> 00:23:58,414
You moron!

296
00:23:59,908 --> 00:24:04,010
Since it's the exam period,
at least pretend to study, got it?

297
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:06,414
Did you hear me?

298
00:24:06,908 --> 00:24:07,991
Yes, sir

299
00:24:09,254 --> 00:24:10,471
Dismissed!

300
00:24:15,378 --> 00:24:16,648
What's this all of a sudden?

301
00:24:17,921 --> 00:24:19,418
It's just about not to
play together. That's all

302
00:24:23,956 --> 00:24:26,465
How are the friends
you’ve been with recently?

303
00:24:44,784 --> 00:24:45,866
What are you doing here?

304
00:24:48,034 --> 00:24:49,221
What are you up to, Hwan?

305
00:24:51,929 --> 00:24:53,633
Are you cleaning the principal's office?

306
00:24:54,529 --> 00:24:56,222
No, I'm not

307
00:24:58,232 --> 00:24:59,326
Actually, I...

308
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,934
I'm taking care of an orchid
in the principal's office

309
00:25:04,151 --> 00:25:06,054
Uh, orchid

310
00:25:07,497 --> 00:25:08,686
Perhaps...

311
00:25:10,812 --> 00:25:12,799
Did the principal say something to you?

312
00:25:15,003 --> 00:25:16,185
Something like what?

313
00:25:18,171 --> 00:25:20,685
Does the principal have
something to say to me?

314
00:25:21,372 --> 00:25:23,081
Well, maybe just

315
00:25:25,666 --> 00:25:27,374
something like being careful about me

316
00:25:28,758 --> 00:25:29,913
You?

317
00:25:31,105 --> 00:25:32,270
Why?

318
00:25:33,669 --> 00:25:35,053
Never mind then

319
00:25:35,054 --> 00:25:36,146
Do well on your exams

320
00:26:21,756 --> 00:26:24,593
Dogeon! Dogeon!

321
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,910
The question you pointed
out came up in the exam

322
00:26:27,911 --> 00:26:29,310
So, did you get it right?

323
00:26:29,311 --> 00:26:31,438
No, I couldn't remember the answer

324
00:26:34,493 --> 00:26:35,653
Ah, Jeha Jeon, gosh

325
00:26:36,338 --> 00:26:39,651
Should we split just because
it's still locked? After the exam?

326
00:26:41,939 --> 00:26:43,722
- Elephant Bunsik, who's in?
- I'm in.

327
00:26:43,723 --> 00:26:45,738
Then, just for fun,

328
00:26:45,739 --> 00:26:47,628
How about the losing team
in a soccer game pays?

329
00:26:48,328 --> 00:26:49,929
Can you play?

330
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:51,537
You just sit on the bench

331
00:26:51,538 --> 00:26:54,330
- Yeah, we're already seven...
- Why seven?

332
00:26:55,229 --> 00:26:56,398
I'm out

333
00:26:57,415 --> 00:26:58,725
Hurry up and make the teams

334
00:26:58,726 --> 00:27:00,750
What are you waiting for?
It's getting dark

335
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:03,843
My team, my team, my team go!

336
00:27:03,844 --> 00:27:05,158
Go, go, go, go

337
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:06,918
My team go, my team go!

338
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:09,074
Go, go, go, go!

339
00:27:11,114 --> 00:27:13,307
Urgh! no, no...

340
00:27:13,308 --> 00:27:15,385
Oh, gosh, sigh

341
00:27:15,386 --> 00:27:16,753
That bro is just...

342
00:27:16,754 --> 00:27:17,951
What are you doing?

343
00:27:17,952 --> 00:27:19,235
Come on!

344
00:27:19,236 --> 00:27:20,804
- Pass, pass, pass!
- Go my team!

345
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,520
- Hey, hey!
- Hurry, hurry

346
00:27:22,521 --> 00:27:24,143
Oh, nice!

347
00:27:25,444 --> 00:27:26,428
Hey, Hwan!

348
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,646
Oh my!

349
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:31,506
You just, no way...

350
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,854
My ball. I got it

351
00:27:37,855 --> 00:27:38,983
Come on!

352
00:27:41,572 --> 00:27:42,700
Goal!

353
00:27:42,701 --> 00:27:43,853
Yes!

354
00:27:44,236 --> 00:27:46,698
See? I told you to do that and it works!

355
00:27:46,699 --> 00:27:48,214
- Right!
- Too late!

356
00:27:48,915 --> 00:27:50,028
Bro

357
00:27:54,688 --> 00:27:57,388
- I scored, I did it
- Jooan!

358
00:27:59,187 --> 00:28:00,365
Jooan!

359
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:41,620
Urgh, I can't hear it

360
00:28:45,025 --> 00:28:46,914
You guys teasing me now, huh?

361
00:28:48,214 --> 00:28:49,362
Jooan

362
00:28:49,741 --> 00:28:50,981
What's wrong?

363
00:28:50,982 --> 00:28:52,665
- Are you okay?
- Stop it

364
00:28:54,491 --> 00:28:57,366
Jeez, stop it already!

365
00:29:14,414 --> 00:29:17,313
Fortunately, the right ear
is back to normal

366
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:22,324
It seems like it was a temporary
hearing loss due to the shock...

367
00:29:24,566 --> 00:29:28,108
- The right side was injured, correct?
- Yes, that's right

368
00:29:29,013 --> 00:29:33,504
But he hurt one ear,
can both ears become deaf?

369
00:29:34,403 --> 00:29:37,018
Right, I couldn't hear
anything for a moment...

370
00:29:39,928 --> 00:29:42,144
Do you do any sports?

371
00:29:42,646 --> 00:29:45,345
Like judo or wrestling?

372
00:29:46,946 --> 00:29:49,044
No, why?

373
00:29:50,144 --> 00:29:52,744
Or maybe you had a car
accident a long time ago?

374
00:29:56,687 --> 00:29:57,831
Or maybe...

375
00:29:58,825 --> 00:30:00,621
you were hit really hard on the left ear

376
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:03,382
Sigh...

377
00:30:04,082 --> 00:30:06,583
Your left ear must have
been deaf for quite a while...

378
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:10,392
You didn't know?

379
00:30:13,381 --> 00:30:14,582
Sigh...

380
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:42,605
Haru, let's unpack this

381
00:30:42,606 --> 00:30:44,786
- Jooan should rest when he's back
- Okay

382
00:30:46,673 --> 00:30:47,878
I'll go with you, Hosu

383
00:30:51,927 --> 00:30:53,123
Eh?

384
00:30:56,483 --> 00:30:57,576
Dad and mom

385
00:30:59,368 --> 00:31:02,166
Wow, Dogeon is so photogenic!

386
00:31:04,467 --> 00:31:07,667
Jeha, your stepfather became the chairman
of the scholarship foundation, right?

387
00:31:10,515 --> 00:31:13,106
Then, have you heard anything
about the scholarship foundation?

388
00:31:14,207 --> 00:31:15,289
No

389
00:31:16,413 --> 00:31:17,437
Ah!

390
00:31:18,057 --> 00:31:21,578
My mom once asked why the scholarship
foundation only selects male students,

391
00:31:22,887 --> 00:31:25,381
and he said something about it's only
for boys because of the issue in the past...

392
00:31:25,986 --> 00:31:27,582
I heard that kind of story before...

393
00:31:29,777 --> 00:31:30,985
What issue?

394
00:31:32,305 --> 00:31:34,595
Mom didn't ask further,
so I don't really know

395
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,049
It'll be okay

396
00:31:56,253 --> 00:31:57,671
You're not Ronaldo or something

397
00:31:57,672 --> 00:31:59,332
What could happen just
because he got hit, right?

398
00:32:01,731 --> 00:32:02,931
You think so?

399
00:32:10,724 --> 00:32:13,522
And if you have any troubles,
you should talk about it

400
00:32:14,226 --> 00:32:15,556
Don't just keep it for yourself

401
00:32:17,493 --> 00:32:19,105
Troubles, like what?

402
00:32:21,561 --> 00:32:22,777
Well, just...

403
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:25,576
Right!

404
00:32:26,475 --> 00:32:29,574
Isn't it annoying that the principal
put you to take care of the plants?

405
00:32:31,269 --> 00:32:33,948
Why would he make you do that
instead of doing it himself?

406
00:32:35,947 --> 00:32:37,149
Well, yeah

407
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:39,115
It is annoying but...

408
00:32:40,028 --> 00:32:43,709
Anyway, since your dad and the principal
are close, it must be hard to refuse

409
00:32:49,293 --> 00:32:50,391
Hwan

410
00:32:51,409 --> 00:32:52,493
Have you, by any chance,

411
00:32:53,385 --> 00:32:56,883
heard anything about the 7th
Songho scholarship members from your dad?

412
00:32:59,061 --> 00:33:01,260
Is it important to you?

413
00:33:03,734 --> 00:33:05,397
You asked about it before...

414
00:33:07,738 --> 00:33:08,939
Um...

415
00:33:10,151 --> 00:33:11,203
Actually,

416
00:33:12,546 --> 00:33:14,586
my mom and your dad

417
00:33:14,587 --> 00:33:17,427
both were from the 7th
Songho scholarship members

418
00:33:18,327 --> 00:33:19,609
I only found out recently

419
00:33:21,606 --> 00:33:24,130
I don't know much about my mom...

420
00:33:24,131 --> 00:33:25,540
Oh, I see

421
00:33:27,579 --> 00:33:28,678
But

422
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:32,357
dad never talked about
the scholarship foundation...

423
00:33:35,715 --> 00:33:36,876
Ah!

424
00:33:37,833 --> 00:33:39,776
Dad's middle and high school records

425
00:33:39,777 --> 00:33:41,933
might be still in the old house...

426
00:33:43,728 --> 00:33:44,947
Really?

427
00:33:47,334 --> 00:33:49,676
Hwan, then maybe...

428
00:34:00,773 --> 00:34:01,970
Why are you here alone?

429
00:34:01,971 --> 00:34:03,183
Where's Jooan?

430
00:34:03,888 --> 00:34:05,586
He went home to get something

431
00:34:06,175 --> 00:34:07,568
What are they saying?

432
00:34:07,569 --> 00:34:09,069
Why he couldn't hear?

433
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:11,264
Well, that's...

434
00:34:13,118 --> 00:34:15,420
The ear that got hit
by the soccer ball is fine

435
00:34:19,128 --> 00:34:21,620
See? I told you it would be okay

436
00:34:23,927 --> 00:34:25,621
He can't hear at all

437
00:34:29,121 --> 00:34:30,422
with his left ear

438
00:34:32,121 --> 00:34:33,253
Why?

439
00:34:34,206 --> 00:34:35,288
Why?

440
00:34:36,279 --> 00:34:37,638
Can't hear?

441
00:34:38,536 --> 00:34:39,828
At the hospital, they said

442
00:34:40,732 --> 00:34:42,291
Juan's left eardrum

443
00:34:42,986 --> 00:34:45,081
was damaged due to continuous impact

444
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:49,085
but it wasn't treated in time,

445
00:34:51,321 --> 00:34:52,969
so he lost his hearing function...

446
00:34:59,062 --> 00:35:01,293
What do you mean by continuous impact?

447
00:35:03,563 --> 00:35:06,862
On that rainy day,
Jooan was hit by his father

448
00:35:11,508 --> 00:35:13,332
Haru and Hosu might not have seen it

449
00:35:13,333 --> 00:35:14,858
Oh, are you here to pick me up?

450
00:36:50,228 --> 00:36:51,433
Hey, Jooan

451
00:36:53,134 --> 00:36:56,179
Jeha and Haru were waiting, but they
left early because it was getting late

452
00:36:58,984 --> 00:37:00,063
Are you hungry?

453
00:37:00,762 --> 00:37:02,147
You want some ramen?

454
00:37:02,148 --> 00:37:03,345
I'm good

455
00:37:26,649 --> 00:37:28,436
Give it to me, I'll open it

456
00:37:32,443 --> 00:37:33,667
Don't touch

457
00:37:40,984 --> 00:37:42,371
Sorry, Jooan

458
00:37:46,761 --> 00:37:47,986
It's okay

459
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:01,168
I said it's okay!

460
00:38:01,169 --> 00:38:03,078
I told you it's okay!

461
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:04,784
- Jooan
- Just for a moment

462
00:38:06,396 --> 00:38:07,527
It's my fault

463
00:38:08,438 --> 00:38:09,828
What did you do wrong?

464
00:38:11,529 --> 00:38:12,715
What are you?

465
00:38:13,804 --> 00:38:15,214
What are you!

466
00:38:15,215 --> 00:38:16,519
Hey, hey Jooan

467
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,718
Stop it, please

468
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:18,980
Hey, Hwan Kim

469
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:23,040
You think I'm pitiful, right?

470
00:38:23,854 --> 00:38:25,866
Like those fundraising
and charity from TV,

471
00:38:25,867 --> 00:38:27,141
it feels real when you see me, doesn't it?

472
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:29,947
Seeing me live like this

473
00:38:29,948 --> 00:38:31,445
makes you feel fortunate
about your own life, right?

474
00:38:31,446 --> 00:38:32,842
Jooan Kim, stop it, okay?

475
00:38:33,449 --> 00:38:34,641
Tell me honestly

476
00:38:36,028 --> 00:38:37,625
You feel good hanging out with us

477
00:38:38,627 --> 00:38:40,666
You know it too,
we're different from you

478
00:38:41,177 --> 00:38:42,595
Everyone watches you

479
00:38:43,275 --> 00:38:44,547
envies you

480
00:38:46,063 --> 00:38:47,844
even the principal looks out for you

481
00:38:48,337 --> 00:38:49,954
Hey, let's go outside, let's go

482
00:38:50,428 --> 00:38:52,081
You still don't know?

483
00:38:52,082 --> 00:38:54,059
I've never called you 'Bro'

484
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:55,278
You know why?

485
00:38:55,279 --> 00:38:57,023
Because I don't accept you!

486
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:58,760
- Let's get some fresh air
- Yeah, let's go, let's go

487
00:38:58,761 --> 00:39:00,058
Let's go out

488
00:39:00,059 --> 00:39:01,848
I know you're taking your anger out on me

489
00:39:09,669 --> 00:39:10,841
But it's not because of me

490
00:39:12,957 --> 00:39:14,104
Your ear

491
00:39:16,861 --> 00:39:18,443
It's your father to hit you

492
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:20,729
Isn't it?

493
00:39:24,317 --> 00:39:25,785
What?

494
00:39:26,491 --> 00:39:27,879
You!

495
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,629
- Stop it!
- Aah!

496
00:39:30,197 --> 00:39:31,995
Aah!

497
00:39:36,969 --> 00:39:39,059
Stop, just stop!

498
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,608
Let go!

499
00:39:42,306 --> 00:39:43,905
Aah!

500
00:39:45,705 --> 00:39:47,547
What's wrong with you?

501
00:39:47,548 --> 00:39:49,165
What did Hwan do wrong?

502
00:39:56,284 --> 00:39:57,504
It's dead

503
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:01,543
It's dead

504
00:40:04,633 --> 00:40:05,894
What, what's dead?

505
00:40:06,917 --> 00:40:08,124
What are you talking about?

506
00:40:12,481 --> 00:40:13,735
Dogeon

507
00:40:16,221 --> 00:40:19,310
That kitten died

508
00:40:26,949 --> 00:40:28,474
Hey, Jooan

509
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:31,340
It died because it was weak

510
00:40:37,378 --> 00:40:39,077
If you're weak, you lose

511
00:40:44,361 --> 00:40:45,758
And if you lose, you die

512
00:40:47,944 --> 00:40:49,364
Die

513
00:42:26,018 --> 00:42:27,166
Oh, you're here?

514
00:42:32,338 --> 00:42:33,545
Why are you...

515
00:42:34,354 --> 00:42:35,869
Sorry for coming all of a sudden

516
00:42:39,071 --> 00:42:40,122
This...

517
00:43:01,207 --> 00:43:02,399
What's going on?

518
00:43:06,655 --> 00:43:08,175
I wanted to ask

519
00:43:10,038 --> 00:43:11,244
something

520
00:43:13,327 --> 00:43:14,822
I didn't have anything to say
about your mom before

521
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:20,419
And I don't have anything to say now too

522
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,256
About the incident with the 7th members

523
00:43:28,947 --> 00:43:30,146
I know about it

524
00:43:32,534 --> 00:43:33,854
About that incident,

525
00:43:35,825 --> 00:43:37,367
I have nothing to tell you

526
00:43:38,951 --> 00:43:40,664
There was an incident, right?

527
00:43:44,965 --> 00:43:46,163
I'm sorry

528
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:59,804
Principal's Office

529
00:44:23,395 --> 00:44:26,392
An exciting vacation
starts in a few hours, right?

530
00:44:27,187 --> 00:44:28,795
To enjoy my vacation,

531
00:44:28,796 --> 00:44:30,594
I feel like I need to ask something

532
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,908
I have nothing more to say
if it's about your mother again

533
00:44:35,899 --> 00:44:37,700
Even if you don’t remember my mom,

534
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,900
Maybe you'll recall something
if it's an incident to the

535
00:44:41,407 --> 00:44:42,763
7th scholarship members

536
00:44:44,357 --> 00:44:45,550
7th?

537
00:44:47,825 --> 00:44:49,939
That's quite an old story

538
00:44:50,477 --> 00:44:52,211
Given my age...

539
00:44:56,043 --> 00:44:57,270
Cein, you seem very curious

540
00:44:58,179 --> 00:45:01,476
about the scholarship
foundation, don't you?

541
00:45:03,582 --> 00:45:05,669
You want to hide that incident, right?

542
00:45:09,425 --> 00:45:12,042
I'm not quite sure what
incident you're talking about

543
00:45:13,428 --> 00:45:14,801
Can you tell me?

544
00:45:14,802 --> 00:45:17,203
If I were to talk,
it certainly wouldn't be here

545
00:45:17,902 --> 00:45:21,338
Perhaps at a police station, education
department, or a newspaper office

546
00:45:22,139 --> 00:45:23,603
Don't you think?

547
00:45:25,896 --> 00:45:27,225
I see

548
00:45:27,925 --> 00:45:30,826
I am also very curious
about what the incident is

549
00:45:32,856 --> 00:45:36,760
Feel free to do as you wish,
wherever that might be

550
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:40,372
You seem to dislike me already

551
00:45:57,075 --> 00:45:59,660
It's time to prepare
the vacation ceremony broadcast...

552
00:45:59,661 --> 00:46:01,670
Okay, you're good to go

553
00:46:05,954 --> 00:46:07,154
Oh, and

554
00:46:09,356 --> 00:46:13,955
I hope you become a student who can
take responsibility for your actions

555
00:46:14,768 --> 00:46:16,555
Whatever they may be

556
00:46:44,094 --> 00:46:47,475
Ranking by class: 1/21
Ranking by school: 3/174

557
00:46:49,450 --> 00:46:51,652
Your father must be feeling relieved now

558
00:46:52,165 --> 00:46:53,363
Good job, Hwan

559
00:46:54,763 --> 00:46:58,176
But from now on,
you don't need to hold back

560
00:46:58,959 --> 00:47:01,546
Why not just comfortably be
the top student in the school?

561
00:47:02,051 --> 00:47:03,548
Wouldn't your father be happier?

562
00:47:07,481 --> 00:47:12,573
Now, do you understand
how much I care for you, Hwan?

563
00:47:29,113 --> 00:47:30,186
Come down

564
00:48:08,131 --> 00:48:09,393
Just say no

565
00:48:10,733 --> 00:48:11,933
Say no

566
00:48:16,822 --> 00:48:17,930
About what?

567
00:48:20,798 --> 00:48:22,597
That my dad didn't do it

568
00:48:26,449 --> 00:48:27,928
It was not you

569
00:48:32,357 --> 00:48:33,763
and it was not my dad

570
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:39,974
Just say like that

571
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:47,248
Just say it happened that way

572
00:48:51,498 --> 00:48:53,492
That I was just unlucky

573
00:48:58,070 --> 00:48:59,748
Say it like that

574
00:49:08,072 --> 00:49:09,272
Right

575
00:49:11,453 --> 00:49:12,861
It just happened that way

576
00:49:15,903 --> 00:49:17,286
It was bad luck

577
00:49:21,549 --> 00:49:22,692
So...

578
00:49:34,201 --> 00:49:35,316
Enough

579
00:49:36,697 --> 00:49:37,797
From now

580
00:50:30,465 --> 00:50:31,740
Mom has

581
00:50:34,234 --> 00:50:36,556
got a house in Munhyeon-si

582
00:50:39,717 --> 00:50:41,695
- To live with you and me
- I'm not going

583
00:51:02,072 --> 00:51:03,823
Are you still mad at mom?

584
00:51:06,019 --> 00:51:07,283
If I go there,

585
00:51:12,502 --> 00:51:14,180
then dad will really be alone

586
00:51:40,595 --> 00:51:41,813
I

587
00:51:42,796 --> 00:51:44,094
can't leave dad again

588
00:52:09,341 --> 00:52:10,618
I still like my dad

589
00:52:51,970 --> 00:52:53,164
You go

590
00:52:56,918 --> 00:52:59,322
Go live with mom there

591
00:53:03,248 --> 00:53:04,620
If you come back,

592
00:53:07,361 --> 00:53:08,967
then you should live like mom

593
00:53:12,847 --> 00:53:14,045
So, you should go

594
00:53:17,679 --> 00:53:18,881
Don't come back

595
00:53:43,649 --> 00:53:44,877
Did someone come home?

596
00:53:46,177 --> 00:53:47,317
Yes

597
00:53:49,445 --> 00:53:50,673
Who?

598
00:54:08,832 --> 00:54:10,243
What's everyone doing?

599
00:54:10,835 --> 00:54:12,445
How about we go to the beach tomorrow?

600
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:48,071
- What is it? Attention seeker?
- Attention seeker?

601
00:54:48,072 --> 00:54:49,511
What, let go!

602
00:54:49,512 --> 00:54:50,831
Let go!

603
00:54:52,256 --> 00:54:54,869
Huh? Hey, wait!

604
00:54:54,870 --> 00:54:55,954
Hey!

605
00:54:55,955 --> 00:54:57,512
Help!

606
00:54:58,543 --> 00:54:59,955
Be careful

607
00:54:59,956 --> 00:55:02,485
- Hey
- Hey guys!

608
00:55:02,987 --> 00:55:04,631
These guys are so weird!

609
00:55:05,036 --> 00:55:06,430
Let's go!

610
00:55:07,165 --> 00:55:08,328
Ahh...

611
00:55:09,352 --> 00:55:11,125
Let's go!

612
00:55:20,579 --> 00:55:22,647
Hey, it's still cold

613
00:55:22,648 --> 00:55:24,023
Hey, you'll get hurt!

614
00:55:24,735 --> 00:55:27,101
Oh my, water can be so dangerous...

615
00:55:27,102 --> 00:55:28,589
- That's what I'm saying
- Whoops

616
00:55:28,590 --> 00:55:31,163
Hey, come on quick, quickly come here

617
00:55:31,164 --> 00:55:33,673
I know, I know

618
00:55:33,674 --> 00:55:36,301
I know how you feel. I do

619
00:55:36,302 --> 00:55:37,700
I'll walk

620
00:56:01,116 --> 00:56:02,183
Hey!

621
00:56:04,390 --> 00:56:05,668
I'm really okay...

622
00:56:06,512 --> 00:56:07,913
- Hwan, quick
- Oh, it's cold!

623
00:56:08,512 --> 00:56:09,722
Come on

624
00:56:45,475 --> 00:56:47,207
Can I ask something?

625
00:56:49,135 --> 00:56:50,460
Cein, that lighter

626
00:56:51,045 --> 00:56:52,670
You always carry it around

627
00:56:53,864 --> 00:56:55,205
Is there any reason?

628
00:56:56,895 --> 00:56:58,098
Right

629
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,058
I never saw you smoking

630
00:57:02,351 --> 00:57:04,753
Yeah, I don't smoke

631
00:57:07,446 --> 00:57:08,659
Um...

632
00:57:09,561 --> 00:57:13,052
But sometimes, just looking at the flame

633
00:57:13,765 --> 00:57:15,650
makes me feel both scared and relaxed

634
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:20,663
It might not make sense as I say it

635
00:57:21,650 --> 00:57:22,840
But it's just like that

636
00:57:24,597 --> 00:57:26,004
I know what you're talking about

637
00:57:27,502 --> 00:57:29,199
I feel something similar
when I climb up high

638
00:57:30,607 --> 00:57:32,396
Scared and relaxed

639
00:57:33,697 --> 00:57:34,831
Really?

640
00:57:35,658 --> 00:57:37,387
Don't do that, it's dangerous

641
00:57:38,507 --> 00:57:39,850
You're still young...

642
00:57:43,031 --> 00:57:44,215
And you must have dreams

643
00:57:45,417 --> 00:57:46,628
Dreams?

644
00:57:48,430 --> 00:57:50,030
Do we really need something like dreams?

645
00:57:53,757 --> 00:57:57,172
I do want to find my mom and be happy

646
00:57:58,762 --> 00:57:59,955
Are you unhappy now?

647
00:58:01,371 --> 00:58:02,480
Well

648
00:58:03,079 --> 00:58:04,545
but it's not just about finding my mom

649
00:58:05,044 --> 00:58:06,954
and living happily together

650
00:58:08,043 --> 00:58:09,546
It's just that if I find her

651
00:58:10,941 --> 00:58:13,358
and see that she's living happily,

652
00:58:15,149 --> 00:58:17,553
then I feel like I can live happily too

653
00:58:19,949 --> 00:58:22,343
When I was young, my dream
was to become president

654
00:58:23,947 --> 00:58:25,406
But now, I'm not sure

655
00:58:27,402 --> 00:58:30,206
Hey, it's okay not to have dreams

656
00:58:31,790 --> 00:58:33,369
I don't dream of such things

657
00:58:34,576 --> 00:58:37,621
Oh, I know Jooan Kim's dream

658
00:58:38,322 --> 00:58:39,585
Winnie-the-Pooh

659
00:58:40,269 --> 00:58:43,656
He wants to walk around
just in a red T-shirt, no pants

660
00:58:43,657 --> 00:58:45,254
because he's a pervert

661
00:58:46,250 --> 00:58:47,709
What are you talking about!

662
00:58:48,108 --> 00:58:49,365
I meant Bearman!

663
00:58:49,865 --> 00:58:52,321
A superhero saving
the world from villains

664
00:58:53,111 --> 00:58:54,308
How cool!

665
00:58:56,024 --> 00:58:57,508
You know it, bro!

666
00:58:58,117 --> 00:58:59,316
Of course

667
00:59:00,224 --> 00:59:01,624
Dreams or whatever

668
00:59:02,627 --> 00:59:04,622
I just hope my
part-time job wage increases more

669
00:59:07,825 --> 00:59:09,223
But still, everyone has dreams

670
00:59:10,629 --> 00:59:13,023
For me, writing down my future
for homework was the hardest...

671
00:59:15,123 --> 00:59:16,762
No matter how much I think about it

672
00:59:17,363 --> 00:59:18,698
Nothing comes to mind

673
00:59:20,545 --> 00:59:21,969
I guess I don't have
anything I want to become

674
00:59:23,964 --> 00:59:25,059
Sometimes

675
00:59:26,158 --> 00:59:28,536
everyone talks about what they
want to be in the future, but

676
00:59:30,739 --> 00:59:31,836
I...

677
00:59:33,627 --> 00:59:35,343
wonder if I'll even be alive by then?

678
00:59:37,361 --> 00:59:40,262
Hey, don't worry, I'll protect you

679
00:59:45,035 --> 00:59:46,754
- Here
- Oh?

680
00:59:48,852 --> 00:59:50,113
Where did you find it?

681
00:59:51,033 --> 00:59:52,271
I thought I had lost it...

682
00:59:53,372 --> 00:59:55,471
Thor shouldn't leave his hammer behind

683
00:59:56,171 --> 00:59:57,452
It's your weapon, right?

684
00:59:58,607 --> 01:00:00,608
Jeha has really grown up

685
01:00:00,609 --> 01:00:02,208
Knowing to take care of such things

686
01:00:02,607 --> 01:00:04,012
I've always been taller
than you, you know?

687
01:00:04,422 --> 01:00:05,735
No, you're not!

688
01:00:06,158 --> 01:00:07,214
Hey, let's measure

689
01:00:07,215 --> 01:00:09,276
- Both of you, stand up, stand up
- Ah, really...

690
01:00:09,277 --> 01:00:11,611
- Stand up
- I'm way taller!

691
01:00:11,612 --> 01:00:13,863
- I'm telling you, I'm taller
- How much...

692
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:16,838
Jeha is much taller, right?

693
01:00:16,839 --> 01:00:18,084
No!

694
01:00:20,175 --> 01:00:22,655
- No way!
- I'm taller!

695
01:00:23,055 --> 01:00:24,542
Jeha is taller, right?

696
01:00:36,955 --> 01:00:38,196
Ahh...

697
01:00:40,893 --> 01:00:42,351
Ah, damn sand

698
01:01:10,297 --> 01:01:11,456
Come in

699
01:01:14,150 --> 01:01:16,193
- Have a seat
- Ah, yes

700
01:01:30,876 --> 01:01:33,371
I was worried I'd leave
without seeing Cein

701
01:01:33,877 --> 01:01:34,941
but I'm glad I see you

702
01:01:36,633 --> 01:01:37,865
Sit down

703
01:01:41,241 --> 01:01:42,445
Sit

704
01:01:53,737 --> 01:01:54,899
I'm sorry

705
01:01:55,954 --> 01:01:57,200
No, it's okay

706
01:01:57,793 --> 01:02:03,204
Today, I came not to talk about Cein

707
01:02:03,595 --> 01:02:07,801
but about your late mother

708
01:02:09,491 --> 01:02:10,783
Actually,

709
01:02:12,005 --> 01:02:16,014
I've avoided discussing it until now,

710
01:02:16,015 --> 01:02:17,584
worried it might hurt Cein

711
01:02:18,484 --> 01:02:21,080
Of course, from Cein's perspective,

712
01:02:21,081 --> 01:02:24,108
it's natural to be curious about his mother

713
01:02:24,981 --> 01:02:28,744
I thought it'd be better to discuss this
in your father's presence,

714
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:33,341
to avoid any misunderstandings

715
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:36,596
Is that okay?

716
01:02:37,108 --> 01:02:38,208
Please go ahead

717
01:02:43,849 --> 01:02:45,748
As Cein knows,

718
01:02:47,502 --> 01:02:50,716
your mother, the late Eunjoo Kim,

719
01:02:51,303 --> 01:02:54,912
was indeed a member of
the 7th Songho scholarship

720
01:02:56,966 --> 01:03:00,567
To me, she was an
unforgettable thorn in my side

721
01:03:04,455 --> 01:03:09,152
She was the first female student in the scholarship foundation
which had only chosen male students before

722
01:03:10,254 --> 01:03:14,153
She was exceptionally bright and witty

723
01:03:15,053 --> 01:03:16,957
and played the piano wonderfully

724
01:03:20,555 --> 01:03:22,335
She was pretty

725
01:03:22,935 --> 01:03:26,536
and more mature than her peers

726
01:03:27,537 --> 01:03:32,945
which perhaps led to
numerous rumors about her

727
01:03:34,236 --> 01:03:35,486
During that time,

728
01:03:36,786 --> 01:03:38,828
I personally had to handle

729
01:03:38,829 --> 01:03:41,890
various incidents that were proven true

730
01:03:44,072 --> 01:03:45,464
Those incidents are

731
01:03:46,379 --> 01:03:50,464
exactly what Cein is curious about,
from the 7th scholarship members

732
01:03:52,562 --> 01:03:58,064
After that, the foundation stopped
selecting female scholarship student

733
01:04:04,234 --> 01:04:11,132
There was some issue between
Eunjoo and Changjun Kim

734
01:04:13,649 --> 01:04:15,012
The assemblyman, Changjun Kim?

735
01:04:15,946 --> 01:04:17,149
Yes

736
01:04:18,158 --> 01:04:23,748
Changjun Kim was also one of
the 7th scholarship members like Eunjoo

737
01:04:23,749 --> 01:04:28,286
It seems natural for young
men and women to mingle,

738
01:04:28,287 --> 01:04:32,971
Eunjoo developed feelings
for Changjun Kim

739
01:04:33,756 --> 01:04:38,999
She confessed her feelings,
but Changjun, focusing on his studies,

740
01:04:39,797 --> 01:04:41,613
rejected her

741
01:04:42,405 --> 01:04:46,643
Eunjoo must have been
deeply hurt by this rejection

742
01:04:47,928 --> 01:04:49,928
Happy birthday Cein

743
01:04:52,525 --> 01:04:57,326
And then she had inappropriate
relationships with several students

744
01:04:57,934 --> 01:05:01,936
It's embarrassing to even mention, but...

745
01:05:03,468 --> 01:05:08,968
Eunjoo falsely accused Changjun Kim of rape

746
01:05:11,989 --> 01:05:13,041
Eventually,

747
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:17,904
as the secretary at the time,
I had to step in to resolve the matter

748
01:05:22,394 --> 01:05:25,291
I hoped she would marry and live well

749
01:05:26,398 --> 01:05:30,890
Especially since I was the one who
recommended Eunjoo for the scholarship,

750
01:05:32,409 --> 01:05:34,090
I deeply regretted what happened

751
01:05:35,589 --> 01:05:40,899
So, I tried to cover up this incident

752
01:05:41,285 --> 01:05:44,279
If Cein knew about mother's past,

753
01:05:45,782 --> 01:05:47,882
I worried you might get hurt

754
01:05:49,846 --> 01:05:53,539
I was also worried about

755
01:05:54,333 --> 01:05:57,342
what would happen if you
heard about this from Hwan,

756
01:05:58,045 --> 01:06:00,540
so I tried to keep the two of you
apart because of that...

757
01:06:01,643 --> 01:06:06,740
Oh, I guess my judgment
fails with age

758
01:06:07,764 --> 01:06:09,072
No, it's not

759
01:06:10,485 --> 01:06:13,871
I'm sorry, I've been too busy with work

760
01:06:16,057 --> 01:06:17,243
and haven't taken care of my children

761
01:06:49,779 --> 01:06:51,768
I'm going to the US to see my brother

762
01:06:52,257 --> 01:06:54,543
Actually, I asked to go to
the beach because of that

763
01:06:55,230 --> 01:06:57,538
Stay safe. I'll be back with a gift

764
01:07:02,086 --> 01:07:03,450
It's Haru Park

765
01:07:05,845 --> 01:07:07,552
Oh, are you here for the hospital admission?

766
01:07:07,553 --> 01:07:09,753
- Yes
- Just a moment, please

767
01:07:16,547 --> 01:07:17,849
You've made a good decision

768
01:07:18,670 --> 01:07:20,256
It's to get better, right?

769
01:07:21,562 --> 01:07:22,704
Yes

770
01:07:39,285 --> 01:07:40,481
Haru Park

771
01:07:41,289 --> 01:07:42,889
You only think about your own troubles?

772
01:07:43,597 --> 01:07:45,827
Have you ever thought
about how families feel

773
01:07:45,828 --> 01:07:48,238
those with a member
suffering from mental illness?

774
01:08:00,889 --> 01:08:02,074
RUN

775
01:08:13,253 --> 01:08:16,468
RUN

776
01:08:22,814 --> 01:08:24,211
RUN

777
01:08:46,444 --> 01:08:49,341
RUN

778
01:09:09,142 --> 01:09:10,441
- Haru
- Yes

779
01:09:11,287 --> 01:09:14,482
- There's this amazing dance
- What is it?

780
01:09:15,482 --> 01:09:17,881
It's a mix of Krump and Popping
