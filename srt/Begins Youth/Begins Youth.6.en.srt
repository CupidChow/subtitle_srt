Don't leave your mother's side today
No matter what...

4
00:00:43,637 --> 00:00:45,001
You just need sleeping pills?

5
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:03,264
Stay in bed.
I'll be back soon with the pills

6
00:01:06,745 --> 00:01:09,471
If there's not enough stove oil,
there's an oil box outside...

7
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,750
Come back safe

8
00:01:16,937 --> 00:01:18,134
Watch out for cars

9
00:01:22,212 --> 00:01:23,737
Take your time

10
00:01:28,057 --> 00:01:29,087
Ok

11
00:01:32,209 --> 00:01:33,336
Sleep tight

12
00:01:35,866 --> 00:01:36,887
Mom

13
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:18,772
Piano Academy

14
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:30,043
Don't leave your mother's side today
No matter what...

15
00:02:37,311 --> 00:02:38,502
Who are you?

16
00:03:28,488 --> 00:03:34,464
The 45th Songjoo Jeil Junior High Graduation Ceremony
Congratulations on your graduation!

17
00:03:42,153 --> 00:03:44,126
We have flowers for the ceremony

18
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,023
Flowers for the ceremony

19
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:54,061
Take a look at colorful flowers

20
00:03:54,714 --> 00:03:56,224
Flowers for the ceremony

21
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,082

Congratulations on your graduation

25
00:04:08,017 --> 00:04:10,925
The 45th Songjoo Jeil Junior High Graduation Ceremony
It pains me to say goodbye to you all...

26
00:04:11,605 --> 00:04:13,141
with whom I've grown close

27
00:04:14,126 --> 00:04:19,782
But every meeting leads to a parting

28
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:26,084
I believe you'll grow into a better person

29
00:04:27,738 --> 00:04:31,540
Ask yourself in the mirror

30
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,507
During my three years of junior high,

31
00:04:35,078 --> 00:04:37,722
did I really cherish every moment?

32
00:04:38,834 --> 00:04:41,289
Did I make any indelible memories?

33
00:04:42,588 --> 00:04:45,404
Did I ponder about my future?

34
00:04:46,526 --> 00:04:47,711
If not

35
00:04:48,232 --> 00:04:49,339
Jooan

36
00:04:51,029 --> 00:04:52,210
Jooan Kim!

37
00:04:52,956 --> 00:04:54,161
Jooan

38
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,287
Yes!

39
00:04:58,807 --> 00:05:00,686
Best of luck. Congratulations

40
00:05:01,327 --> 00:05:02,438
Thank you

41
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:06,741
- Haru Park
- Yes

42
00:05:10,213 --> 00:05:11,512
Best of luck. Congratulations

43
00:05:11,513 --> 00:05:12,780
Thank you

44
00:05:12,781 --> 00:05:13,963
- Haru, here
- Haru

45
00:05:19,514 --> 00:05:21,554
- You have a beautiful mother
- Thank you

46
00:05:22,404 --> 00:05:25,482
For a year, we had
our ups and downs together

47
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,415
I hope you enjoy your high school

48
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,727
I'll always be here for you

49
00:05:32,728 --> 00:05:33,846
Class captain

50
00:05:35,414 --> 00:05:36,532
Attention

51
00:05:38,507 --> 00:05:41,040
- Bow
- Thank you

52
00:05:41,354 --> 00:05:42,809
- Thank you
- Thank you, ma'am

53
00:05:43,946 --> 00:05:45,774
- What do you want to eat?
- Jajang!

54
00:05:45,775 --> 00:05:46,775
Really? Ok, let's go eat...

55
00:06:01,436 --> 00:06:03,420
Dad, are you really not coming?

56
00:06:04,401 --> 00:06:06,434
Ready? One, two, three

57
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,296
I'll take one more

58
00:06:09,297 --> 00:06:10,309
Move a little closer

59
00:06:10,841 --> 00:06:13,321
- Smile
- Here we go

60
00:06:13,322 --> 00:06:14,867
One, two, three!

61
00:06:15,838 --> 00:06:16,994
Jooan!

62
00:06:19,464 --> 00:06:21,716
- Let's take a photo
- No, I won't

63
00:06:22,195 --> 00:06:24,258
Come on, it's our graduation

64
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,322
Leave me alone. Go take it yourself

65
00:06:26,323 --> 00:06:27,927
- Come on
- Wow, what's that?

66
00:06:30,117 --> 00:06:31,167
Wow!

67
00:06:33,998 --> 00:06:37,038
Where is Jooan Kim!

68
00:06:54,911 --> 00:06:56,054
Hey!

69
00:06:56,055 --> 00:06:57,451
Jooan Kim!

70
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,141
Why are you doing this?

71
00:07:08,413 --> 00:07:09,785
What? Hosu?

72
00:07:15,588 --> 00:07:17,291
Jooan Kim, stop there!

73
00:07:22,788 --> 00:07:23,971
Congratulations on your graduation

74
00:07:37,106 --> 00:07:38,987
Jooan Kim, congratulations!

75
00:07:38,988 --> 00:07:40,725
Jooan Kim, congrats! Congrats!

76
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:42,305
Jooan Kim, congratulations!

77
00:07:42,306 --> 00:07:43,961
Congratulations!

78
00:07:43,962 --> 00:07:45,563
Congratulations! Congrats!

79
00:07:48,045 --> 00:07:49,371
Stop it

80
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:00,675
We'll have those for now

81
00:08:00,676 --> 00:08:02,086
We'll order more if that's not enough

82
00:08:02,467 --> 00:08:04,479
- Thank you
- Thank you. It won't be long

83
00:08:09,067 --> 00:08:11,082
Mom and Dad wanted to have

84
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:12,568
a meal together after the ceremony

85
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:15,240
I wanted to thank you

86
00:08:15,241 --> 00:08:17,774
for being good friends with Haru

87
00:08:18,459 --> 00:08:21,756
School wouldn't have been easy,
so let's stuff ourselves today

88
00:08:22,365 --> 00:08:24,134
- Thank you
- Thank you

89
00:08:24,628 --> 00:08:27,334
How did you come up with the idea?

90
00:08:27,335 --> 00:08:28,803
Dinosaur costume

91
00:08:28,804 --> 00:08:31,846
will definitely stay
in your memories for long

92
00:08:32,748 --> 00:08:34,363
He used to talk about...

93
00:08:35,052 --> 00:08:37,146
the Halloween party back in the States

94
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,872
Hwan paid for the dinosaur costumes

95
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,341
- Oh, really?
- Really?

96
00:08:43,837 --> 00:08:46,790
Oh, right. Your father's
a well-known figure!

97
00:08:47,461 --> 00:08:50,468
- Ah...
- Oh, Mom, remember?

98
00:08:51,478 --> 00:08:53,088
Ah, Sangmin. Take them out

99
00:08:53,631 --> 00:08:55,201
- Oh, yes
- We should give each one out

100
00:08:58,944 --> 00:09:00,311
Yes, take one each

101
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:10,706
Oh, it's a padded coat!

102
00:09:11,283 --> 00:09:12,357
This...

103
00:09:12,963 --> 00:09:14,168
would've cost you a lot...

104
00:09:14,865 --> 00:09:16,720
Oh, you even recognized the brand

105
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,975
- How expensive is it?
- I don't know

106
00:09:21,487 --> 00:09:23,711
I'm not sure whether
we should accept this...

107
00:09:23,712 --> 00:09:25,836
Mom wanted to buy these for you, right?

108
00:09:25,837 --> 00:09:28,548
Yes, though the winter's coming to an end

109
00:09:28,549 --> 00:09:30,934
we still have the last cold snap

110
00:09:31,224 --> 00:09:33,573
Everything has the same design and color

111
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:35,366
Sorry we couldn't consider individual taste

112
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:36,670
No, they're incredible!

113
00:09:36,964 --> 00:09:38,621
- Thank you
- I'll wear this every day

114
00:09:38,622 --> 00:09:39,842
- Thank you
- Thank you

115
00:09:39,843 --> 00:09:41,446
- Thank you
- Thank you

116
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,449
Please...

117
00:09:45,135 --> 00:09:47,020
take care of our Haru

118
00:09:47,645 --> 00:09:49,425
Of course, I'll look out for him

119
00:10:00,694 --> 00:10:02,008
It's so good

120
00:10:02,386 --> 00:10:03,913
I'm not trying to flatter you...

121
00:10:04,686 --> 00:10:06,789
but I thought you're Haru's older siblings

122
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,624
You're so young and good-looking

123
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:09,733
Oh

124
00:10:10,334 --> 00:10:11,581
He has a good eye

125
00:10:11,582 --> 00:10:13,944
You didn't say that during
the parent-teacher meeting

126
00:10:13,945 --> 00:10:16,192
It was my first time meeting them

127
00:10:16,193 --> 00:10:17,890
so I couldn't

128
00:10:19,066 --> 00:10:22,111
Haru always talked about you...

129
00:10:22,943 --> 00:10:24,237
I really wanted to meet in person

130
00:10:24,733 --> 00:10:25,982
- He did?
- Yeah

131
00:10:26,391 --> 00:10:28,004
My brother's in the States

132
00:10:28,591 --> 00:10:30,575
He goes to a freaking good college

133
00:10:30,576 --> 00:10:33,094
- I have an awesome brother
- When did I say that?

134
00:10:33,095 --> 00:10:34,707
When?

135
00:10:36,215 --> 00:10:39,407
Did Haru happen to mention me...

136
00:10:42,413 --> 00:10:43,536
Maybe not

137
00:10:43,941 --> 00:10:45,109
Please have some yuringi

138
00:10:46,318 --> 00:10:48,584
He might've mentioned
a great dancer guy...

139
00:10:52,346 --> 00:10:53,346
It's ugly, stop it

140
00:10:58,213 --> 00:11:03,425
International Restaurant of Chinese Food

141
00:11:04,027 --> 00:11:06,155
- Thank you for the meal
- Thank you for the meal

142
00:11:06,156 --> 00:11:07,306
Thank you

143
00:11:07,307 --> 00:11:08,333
Thank you for the padded coat

144
00:11:08,944 --> 00:11:10,873
- I'll wear it well
- Thank you

145
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,583
You're going home with us, right?

146
00:11:17,465 --> 00:11:20,069
Yes, you should come home with us today

147
00:11:21,373 --> 00:11:22,932
Who is the last coat for?

148
00:11:25,348 --> 00:11:27,159
Ah, this is for my friend

149
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,419
He's graduating today as well

150
00:11:29,358 --> 00:11:30,793
Oh, the one who goes to
Munhyeon Junior High?

151
00:11:31,782 --> 00:11:33,786
You're close enough to give him a present?

152
00:11:34,587 --> 00:11:35,857
That's surprising

153
00:11:35,868 --> 00:11:38,142
- No, I was just...
- Uh? Your dad's coming

154
00:11:38,557 --> 00:11:39,694
Let's get in the car

155
00:11:40,014 --> 00:11:41,450
- Goodbye
- Thanks for the present

156
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:42,482
Goodbye

157
00:11:42,483 --> 00:11:43,845
- Goodbye
- Bye

158
00:11:54,475 --> 00:11:55,530
I'll get going, too

159
00:11:56,419 --> 00:11:57,598
Congrats on your graduation

160
00:11:58,252 --> 00:11:59,350
Me, too!

161
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:00,748
Congrats on becoming a high schooler!

162
00:12:02,035 --> 00:12:03,150
What?

163
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,518
They're leaving right after the meal?

164
00:12:06,473 --> 00:12:08,515
- Let's go to your dry container
- No, I...

165
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:12,226
I can't go today

166
00:12:12,738 --> 00:12:13,859
Why?

167
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:15,700
You're going to Dohyeon again?

168
00:12:17,193 --> 00:12:18,511
I mean...

169
00:12:18,858 --> 00:12:20,227
today's my graduation

170
00:12:20,228 --> 00:12:22,189
Shouldn't I deserve
the man-of-the-hour treatment?

171
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:24,011
Cut him some slack. It's about his brother

172
00:12:24,012 --> 00:12:25,297
I'm also his brother!

173
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:27,813
Just for today. I'm really sorry

174
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,269
So happy that you graduated

175
00:12:30,378 --> 00:12:31,665
Forget it. Go

176
00:12:34,868 --> 00:12:36,179
Come to my place tomorrow

177
00:12:36,574 --> 00:12:38,567
- Ok?
- No, I won't

178
00:12:39,575 --> 00:12:40,729
Let's go

179
00:12:41,336 --> 00:12:43,600
I'll get going.
Congrats on your graduation!

180
00:12:43,601 --> 00:12:44,984
- Bye
- Bye

181
00:12:50,597 --> 00:12:51,661
Darn it!

182
00:12:58,594 --> 00:12:59,677
Do you want to go to the gaming room?

183
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,217
Yes!

184
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:26,036
Jooan, one kill for me

185
00:13:26,037 --> 00:13:27,328
I...

186
00:13:30,051 --> 00:13:31,307
Ah...

187
00:13:33,603 --> 00:13:34,793
That was me

188
00:13:36,684 --> 00:13:37,837
Sorry

189
00:13:39,163 --> 00:13:42,358
You can't tell
your enemies from your ally?

190
00:13:42,606 --> 00:13:44,260
Even just now,
after killing your teammate...

191
00:13:44,641 --> 00:13:46,481
you screamed "yes," didn't you?

192
00:13:47,079 --> 00:13:48,666
No, I...

193
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:50,324
What "No?" You screamed

194
00:13:50,325 --> 00:13:53,478
"Yes, Jooan, one kill!" just now

195
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:55,517
Yea he's going down

196
00:13:55,518 --> 00:13:57,860
Yea he's going down. That's what I said

197
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:02,042
I was watching you play, and
I couldn't believe my eyes

198
00:14:02,755 --> 00:14:05,483
How come you do one tap
headshots only when you team kill

199
00:14:05,484 --> 00:14:07,087
Really? Was that a headshot?

200
00:14:12,289 --> 00:14:13,572
My goodness

201
00:14:13,963 --> 00:14:15,251
You suck at games

202
00:14:15,847 --> 00:14:17,321
You don't just suck at it

203
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:22,136
I think you have to battle
against yourself, not against your enemy

204
00:14:35,659 --> 00:14:38,160
The elder wants to have dinner with you

205
00:14:38,249 --> 00:14:40,063
before you return to the States

206
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,426
- Do you have time tomorrow?
- Tomorrow?

207
00:14:42,427 --> 00:14:43,924
I was supposed to meet my friend...

208
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:45,001
I'll check with him

209
00:14:45,493 --> 00:14:47,048
I also want to go

210
00:14:50,446 --> 00:14:51,543
Ok

211
00:14:56,594 --> 00:15:00,096
- Hello
- Oh, you graduated today!

212
00:15:00,097 --> 00:15:01,196
Congratulations

213
00:15:01,948 --> 00:15:04,267
- You'll attend Jeil High then?
- Yes

214
00:15:05,533 --> 00:15:09,091
Your brother flew from the States for you.
You must be very happy

215
00:15:09,485 --> 00:15:12,100
- Goodbye then
- Goodbye

216
00:15:22,945 --> 00:15:24,701
The door's closing

217
00:15:30,218 --> 00:15:31,402
How was your graduation ceremony?

218
00:15:33,197 --> 00:15:36,309
I have a present for you next time we meet

219
00:15:38,505 --> 00:15:39,701
It's just a padded coat...

220
00:15:43,971 --> 00:15:46,716
I bought yours, too,
when I was buying for my friends

221
00:15:47,236 --> 00:15:48,351
It's same as mine

222
00:15:51,766 --> 00:15:53,845
Ribbit Ribbit! Ribbit!

223
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:59,253
Come to me whenever you miss your mom

224
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,152
I'll make one for you every day

225
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:07,006
Now, let's go play! Whoosh!

226
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:13,458
Yangji Orphanage

227
00:16:17,697 --> 00:16:19,106
You don't meet them anymore, right?

228
00:16:21,909 --> 00:16:23,113
Why aren't you answering Mom's calls?

229
00:16:23,999 --> 00:16:26,144
Mom and Dad worry about you a lot

230
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:30,808
They want to know whether
you're sleeping and eating well

231
00:16:32,817 --> 00:16:35,421
I told them it's different from
other juvenile halls, but still...

232
00:16:38,641 --> 00:16:41,434
- Mom wanted to come...
- No, tell her not to come

233
00:16:48,033 --> 00:16:49,845
You don't want me to come as well?

234
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,372
Hey

235
00:17:10,683 --> 00:17:12,626
They said it's expensive. Try it on

236
00:17:19,936 --> 00:17:21,150
Go on. Try it

237
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,497
It looks good on you

238
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:39,695
If you have any problems,
call me right away

239
00:17:40,409 --> 00:17:43,391
If you can't reach me,
you can talk to Hosu

240
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,711
How can I trust him?

241
00:17:49,325 --> 00:17:50,946
You can trust Hosu

242
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:56,564
I also want someone like Hosu
to look after me...

243
00:17:57,791 --> 00:17:58,927
sometimes

244
00:18:02,436 --> 00:18:03,868
Yangji Orphanage
Please take care of Dohyeon

245
00:18:03,869 --> 00:18:06,055
Don't worry.
Your brother is my brother, too

246
00:18:10,266 --> 00:18:11,472
I'll get going

247
00:18:11,473 --> 00:18:14,194
- Take this. I can run back in
- No, keep it

248
00:18:14,195 --> 00:18:16,201
- I said take it!
- I'll run home

249
00:18:18,957 --> 00:18:20,496
- I'll get going
- Ok, bye

250
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:39,446
You're looking at it
as if it's a stranger's house

251
00:18:41,847 --> 00:18:42,938
Jooan

252
00:18:45,927 --> 00:18:47,807
Congratulations on your graduation

253
00:18:58,866 --> 00:19:00,033
Should've come to the school

254
00:19:00,828 --> 00:19:02,028
I did

255
00:19:03,524 --> 00:19:05,431
But you were with your friends...

256
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:10,275
I was the only one without...

257
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:12,128
my family

258
00:19:14,405 --> 00:19:15,967
I think I was the only one
in my entire school

259
00:19:21,567 --> 00:19:24,963
Mom also wanted to attend your ceremony

260
00:19:26,459 --> 00:19:28,166
She worried she might run into Dad

261
00:19:32,581 --> 00:19:35,114
- Mom also misses you a lot
- If she misses me...

262
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:39,608
tell her to come herself...

263
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,068
instead of sending you

264
00:19:54,145 --> 00:19:55,600
Munhyeon-si Siyoung Apartment!

265
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:01,220
Just in case Dad hits you again...

266
00:21:12,069 --> 00:21:13,581
Damn it!

267
00:21:20,215 --> 00:21:22,027
It was my graduation today!

268
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:25,217
Your son's graduation!

269
00:21:30,727 --> 00:21:32,264
Are you going to stay stuck here forever?

270
00:21:34,367 --> 00:21:36,491
You said you're afraid to die
that you can't even go out

271
00:21:38,507 --> 00:21:41,348
You said you don't want to die
like your Foundation friends!

272
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:52,669
You'll kill yourself
if you keep drinking like this!

273
00:21:55,225 --> 00:21:56,641
Shut it

274
00:22:20,197 --> 00:22:21,602
If you continue living like this...

275
00:22:22,712 --> 00:22:24,821
I'll go and live with Mom

276
00:22:25,414 --> 00:22:26,603
I mean it!

277
00:22:34,306 --> 00:22:36,981
As the dry spell continues,
especially around

278
00:22:36,982 --> 00:22:39,782
Yeongdong and Yeongnam
in Gangwon, forest fires...

279
00:22:57,248 --> 00:23:01,035
Is Haru really going with us tomorrow?

280
00:23:01,355 --> 00:23:04,833
We told the elder,
Haru has a heart problem...

281
00:23:05,836 --> 00:23:07,246
What can we do?

282
00:23:07,247 --> 00:23:08,839
He should do as he wishes

283
00:23:12,548 --> 00:23:13,736
Mom

284
00:23:18,509 --> 00:23:19,648
Haru

285
00:23:20,871 --> 00:23:22,258
When are you going to stop doing this?

286
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,721
Stop what?

287
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:28,565
Doing things as you please

288
00:23:29,068 --> 00:23:31,280
How much more should we put up with you?

289
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:33,265
As if we did something wrong

290
00:23:34,937 --> 00:23:36,005
Sangmin

291
00:23:36,705 --> 00:23:37,759
If so...

292
00:23:38,928 --> 00:23:40,817
I'm the way I am because
I did something wrong?

293
00:23:44,527 --> 00:23:47,842
Me going to psychiatric hospitals,
hiding my own illness...

294
00:23:49,384 --> 00:23:51,175
unable to make friends
because of the rumors

295
00:23:51,176 --> 00:23:53,165
transferring schools every time...

296
00:23:55,185 --> 00:23:56,908
All those because I'm at fault?

297
00:23:59,212 --> 00:24:00,647
You... couldn't help it...

298
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:03,773
You couldn't help it, not me

299
00:24:06,849 --> 00:24:08,339
Even then, even at the hospital...

300
00:24:09,801 --> 00:24:12,219
That was all for you

301
00:24:12,604 --> 00:24:15,416
If people start talking about
what happened again...

302
00:24:16,944 --> 00:24:19,488
you think you can take it
when you're still weak?

303
00:24:19,489 --> 00:24:21,691
I'm ill not because I'm weak

304
00:24:21,692 --> 00:24:24,026
but because you forced me to hide it

305
00:24:24,027 --> 00:24:25,623
- Haru
- So!

306
00:24:28,929 --> 00:24:31,713
it's not me who decides when to stop...

307
00:24:34,329 --> 00:24:36,127
it's Dad and Mom, okay?

308
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:46,103
If you let me talk about
what happened that day...

309
00:24:50,147 --> 00:24:52,465
If only you let me, I can live...

310
00:24:54,958 --> 00:24:56,332
normally...

311
00:24:59,563 --> 00:25:00,684
like other people

312
00:25:21,455 --> 00:25:22,455
Lord

313
00:25:25,206 --> 00:25:26,469
Dear Heavenly Father...

314
00:26:22,724 --> 00:26:24,911
Honey, are you ok?

315
00:26:25,211 --> 00:26:26,443
Haru, are you ok?

316
00:26:27,075 --> 00:26:29,008
Is he out of his mind?

317
00:26:29,498 --> 00:26:30,822
Haru, are you alright?

318
00:26:32,206 --> 00:26:34,809
Excuse me, you cut in out of nowhere!

319
00:26:35,248 --> 00:26:37,318
What do you mean "out of nowhere?"

320
00:26:38,007 --> 00:26:40,517
You suddenly cut in in front of us!

321
00:26:40,518 --> 00:26:43,326
My bumper was already in

322
00:26:43,327 --> 00:26:44,975
- It was already in!
- I didn't speed just now!

323
00:26:44,976 --> 00:26:47,585
I didn't, and you cut in out of the blue

324
00:26:47,586 --> 00:26:48,758
Not "out of the blue!"

325
00:26:48,759 --> 00:26:50,254
My car was already in!

326
00:26:50,255 --> 00:26:53,669
- What! Are you a novice or what?
- Don't push my shoulder!

327
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:55,824
- Are you drunk driving?
- I didn't drink!

328
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:58,538
- Why cut in out of the blue?
- What nonsense!

329
00:27:01,611 --> 00:27:02,824
Haru

330
00:27:11,489 --> 00:27:12,574
Haru

331
00:27:13,652 --> 00:27:14,749
Um...

332
00:27:18,956 --> 00:27:20,025
Haru

333
00:28:45,053 --> 00:28:46,428
- Hello, I'm candidate number four
- Hello

334
00:28:47,323 --> 00:28:48,687
Oh, sir

335
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:50,517
How do you do?

336
00:28:50,518 --> 00:28:52,558
- I'm good
- Is your business doing well?

337
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:53,989
- Please help us
- I also need your help

338
00:28:54,589 --> 00:28:56,116
- We'll meet again
- Thank you

339
00:28:58,208 --> 00:29:00,211
- Oh, candidate Park
- Yes, candidate Kim

340
00:29:00,212 --> 00:29:01,582
All the best for your campaign

341
00:29:01,583 --> 00:29:02,811
It's not an easy work

342
00:29:02,812 --> 00:29:04,151
- Wish you the best of luck
- Yes

343
00:29:04,152 --> 00:29:05,570
- All the best
- Yes, good luck to you

344
00:29:09,465 --> 00:29:10,819
- Hello, sir
- Candidate number four

345
00:29:22,021 --> 00:29:24,905
Songjoo-si's First Candidate for
the National Assembly, Jaechan Cho

346
00:29:30,591 --> 00:29:32,268
Songjoo-si's Fourth Candidate for
the National Assembly, Changjun Kim

347
00:29:47,204 --> 00:29:48,769
- Isn't that Hwan?
- That's Hwan?

348
00:29:49,397 --> 00:29:51,711
- That's Hwan
- You're right!

349
00:29:51,712 --> 00:29:53,140
Hwan...

350
00:29:53,141 --> 00:29:54,590
- It's him
- Hey!

351
00:30:32,562 --> 00:30:33,646
Have a safe trip

352
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:38,290
Today...

353
00:30:40,081 --> 00:30:41,302
you did well

354
00:30:45,806 --> 00:30:46,834
Thank you

355
00:32:25,731 --> 00:32:27,025
Do you want to come to my place?

356
00:32:27,961 --> 00:32:29,344
My dad went to Seoul

357
00:32:39,815 --> 00:32:41,230
- Wow!
- Come on, hurry up

358
00:32:41,231 --> 00:32:42,309
Oh? Hwan!

359
00:32:44,213 --> 00:32:45,626
It's cold. Let's get inside

360
00:32:46,221 --> 00:32:49,076
- We're here!
- Wow, is it a palace or what?

361
00:32:49,541 --> 00:32:51,024
Well, I'm used to this place

362
00:32:51,025 --> 00:32:52,120
- How do we get in?
- Let's go in

363
00:32:53,953 --> 00:32:55,227
Not that door. Here

364
00:32:55,569 --> 00:32:56,800
Oh, there?

365
00:32:56,801 --> 00:32:58,964
Wow, Hwan. What's this room for?

366
00:32:59,246 --> 00:33:00,795
- This is a guest room
- What about here?

367
00:33:01,207 --> 00:33:03,197
- That's also a guest room
- Let's go in quickly

368
00:33:03,198 --> 00:33:05,093
- Ok
- Haru, come quick

369
00:33:06,496 --> 00:33:07,919
- Let's go in
- Did you shoot everything?

370
00:33:08,551 --> 00:33:09,556
Oh, this!

371
00:33:18,158 --> 00:33:20,678
I knew he was rich,
but he was freaking rich

372
00:33:21,776 --> 00:33:24,078
You're freaking rich! What's all this?

373
00:33:25,486 --> 00:33:27,071
The ambience is amazing, Hwan

374
00:33:27,483 --> 00:33:29,036
Like the rich guy's house...

375
00:33:29,817 --> 00:33:31,770
- in dramas
- It's not

376
00:33:35,826 --> 00:33:37,105
Don't, don't touch that

377
00:33:37,611 --> 00:33:38,630
Yes, Secretary Kim

378
00:33:39,325 --> 00:33:42,206
Transfer three billion
to New York right away

379
00:33:42,903 --> 00:33:43,944
Yes

380
00:33:45,199 --> 00:33:47,235
Hey, Director Kim

381
00:33:50,436 --> 00:33:51,659
Aww

382
00:33:52,395 --> 00:33:54,863
Sir, how about your trip to Maldives?

383
00:33:54,864 --> 00:33:56,287
For mere three billion, you did what?

384
00:33:57,327 --> 00:33:58,375
Manager Kim

385
00:33:58,696 --> 00:33:59,967
Don't overstep the mark

386
00:33:59,968 --> 00:34:01,977
Oh, Director Jeon

387
00:34:02,745 --> 00:34:04,347
Oh, Chairman Park

388
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,909
Oh, Chairman Park, what is

389
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:11,200
a humble person like you doing here?

390
00:34:13,086 --> 00:34:15,633
So obvious
you've never been out in society

391
00:34:16,244 --> 00:34:17,350
Hey, how about me?

392
00:34:17,951 --> 00:34:19,313
Do I look like I own this place?

393
00:34:22,815 --> 00:34:25,520
At least be like me
to say you own this place

394
00:34:26,315 --> 00:34:28,000
Hey, take a photo for me

395
00:34:28,304 --> 00:34:31,034
Wear a tracksuit, and
it would've been perfect

396
00:34:31,723 --> 00:34:35,241
The fact that you're taking a photo
means it's not your house

397
00:34:35,242 --> 00:34:36,655
Who takes a photo inside their own house?

398
00:34:37,752 --> 00:34:39,938
One, two three!

399
00:34:44,413 --> 00:34:45,677
Why did you get up?

400
00:34:55,449 --> 00:34:57,152
It's ok. He already knows

401
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,582
Had dinner?

402
00:35:04,054 --> 00:35:06,188
- Here you go. Thank you
- Yes, thank you

403
00:35:07,277 --> 00:35:08,533
Thank you, sir

404
00:35:08,534 --> 00:35:10,195
No problem. Enjoy the food

405
00:35:13,835 --> 00:35:14,947
Hey

406
00:35:15,711 --> 00:35:17,601
He even wraps a chicken inside a pizza

407
00:35:18,894 --> 00:35:19,933
That's him, right?

408
00:35:20,655 --> 00:35:23,654
- Living with his stepdad in our apartment
- Yes

409
00:35:24,653 --> 00:35:26,167
The one next to him

410
00:35:26,168 --> 00:35:28,545
looks normal unlike the rumors
and the first impression

411
00:35:29,833 --> 00:35:31,048
That's all gossip

412
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:33,003
Cein's a good guy

413
00:35:33,681 --> 00:35:35,876
Well, if you say so

414
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,376
If it weren't for you...

415
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:40,454
I would've been kicked out that day

416
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:42,263
Hwan Kim!

417
00:35:46,828 --> 00:35:47,878
Come back in

418
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:57,509
No, you know your father's not like that

419
00:35:58,307 --> 00:35:59,519
He cares about you a lot

420
00:36:01,506 --> 00:36:03,714
The only thing he learned from his father

421
00:36:03,715 --> 00:36:05,909
is about being a politician. That's why

422
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:09,311
My dad...

423
00:36:10,656 --> 00:36:12,418
Is he really going for the redevelopment?

424
00:36:15,408 --> 00:36:16,619
I'm not sure

425
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,412
I know what you're thinking

426
00:36:21,803 --> 00:36:24,815
From that day onward, you stayed low,
went to school...

427
00:36:25,815 --> 00:36:27,627
followed him around in his campaign...

428
00:36:29,609 --> 00:36:31,409
all because of them, isn't it?

429
00:36:33,499 --> 00:36:36,407
You expect that if you act like a good son

430
00:36:36,408 --> 00:36:39,010
perhaps you'll be able to
persuade him in the future

431
00:36:40,543 --> 00:36:42,505
- I'll eat this first
- Right

432
00:36:42,506 --> 00:36:44,129
- Why? Eat this first
- Eat slowly

433
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:46,412
Now, the water park's open

434
00:36:47,275 --> 00:36:51,475
At first, I worried about you hanging out
with kids from this neighborhood

435
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,871
But after I thought about it...

436
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:58,476
my friends weren't anything special either

437
00:37:00,177 --> 00:37:02,881
But even so, they meant a world to me

438
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:07,215
Well, that's what friends are for

439
00:37:09,337 --> 00:37:10,483
I think...

440
00:37:11,078 --> 00:37:13,138
we're meant to meet one another

441
00:37:15,131 --> 00:37:16,662
I know it sounds weird...

442
00:37:17,671 --> 00:37:18,738
but I feel like...

443
00:37:19,424 --> 00:37:21,233
we were meant to be...

444
00:37:21,853 --> 00:37:24,224
as if it's written somewhere

445
00:37:25,036 --> 00:37:27,179
I can't explain it

446
00:37:34,284 --> 00:37:36,851
I also wish that's how things
worked in this world

447
00:37:39,317 --> 00:37:40,430
- Still...
- You'll upset your stomach

448
00:37:41,132 --> 00:37:42,275
just maybe

449
00:37:44,881 --> 00:37:47,018
Yes, just maybe

450
00:37:48,215 --> 00:37:50,112
Eat up, clean after, and
don't get into trouble

451
00:37:50,516 --> 00:37:51,615
Enjoy your food

452
00:37:52,417 --> 00:37:54,421
- Thank you
- Thank you

453
00:38:07,114 --> 00:38:09,548
I remembered what you've told me before...

454
00:38:11,729 --> 00:38:14,122
so I rummaged through the storage

455
00:38:16,406 --> 00:38:19,003
- Did you find anything?
- Yes, like you said...

456
00:38:19,809 --> 00:38:22,794
my dad and your mother were
members in the same year

457
00:38:25,735 --> 00:38:28,430
But, other than that... not really

458
00:38:37,677 --> 00:38:38,893
The rumor

459
00:38:41,366 --> 00:38:42,492
You've heard it too, right?

460
00:38:46,188 --> 00:38:49,677
The member of the Liberal Innovation Party
talked about it, right?

461
00:38:50,664 --> 00:38:53,674
- Changjun Kim was involved in sexual assault...
- That?

462
00:38:55,243 --> 00:38:56,876
I heard that's a false report

463
00:38:56,877 --> 00:38:58,885
My mom reported it

464
00:39:01,461 --> 00:39:02,864
That's what the principal said

465
00:39:04,285 --> 00:39:06,778
My mom used to have a crush on your father

466
00:39:07,989 --> 00:39:10,313
But your father didn't accept her...

467
00:39:11,226 --> 00:39:13,088
so she filed a false report

468
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:16,619
I can't say that's not true

469
00:39:18,107 --> 00:39:19,409
I can't ask her...

470
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:22,936
because my mom's not around

471
00:39:27,999 --> 00:39:30,307
It doesn't mean I'm doubting your father

472
00:39:32,251 --> 00:39:34,389
I just want to know the truth

473
00:39:36,852 --> 00:39:38,046
That's all

474
00:39:39,918 --> 00:39:40,994
Ah!

475
00:39:46,192 --> 00:39:47,602
That's my mom

476
00:39:48,906 --> 00:39:51,192
Oh, she's beautiful

477
00:39:52,869 --> 00:39:54,753
She looks like you

478
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:57,154
That's interesting

479
00:39:59,739 --> 00:40:01,445
I don't look like my mom at all

480
00:40:02,558 --> 00:40:03,720
No way

481
00:40:04,308 --> 00:40:06,104
I saw the photos in your house

482
00:40:06,495 --> 00:40:09,313
You're the spitting image of
your father and grandfather

483
00:40:11,799 --> 00:40:12,998
Lucky for me

484
00:40:13,891 --> 00:40:16,114
My father doesn't like me anyway

485
00:40:17,712 --> 00:40:20,205
He would've hated me more
if I looked like my mom

486
00:40:21,638 --> 00:40:22,709
Why?

487
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:26,485
My parents didn't get along

488
00:40:28,586 --> 00:40:31,205
I only have memories

489
00:40:31,206 --> 00:40:32,995
up until I was seven

490
00:40:37,403 --> 00:40:39,102
It was the worst in my house

491
00:40:40,534 --> 00:40:43,779
After Mom closed her dear piano academy...

492
00:40:45,373 --> 00:40:47,587
her depression turned for the worse

493
00:40:49,074 --> 00:40:51,601
Dad hated her for being weak

494
00:40:54,584 --> 00:40:56,170
The same goes for
the fire incident last year

495
00:41:00,882 --> 00:41:01,992
The fire incident...

496
00:41:04,053 --> 00:41:05,548
I heard they didn't catch the culprit yet

497
00:41:15,333 --> 00:41:17,059
How could they?

498
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,014
How would they catch the culprit?

499
00:41:38,631 --> 00:41:39,900
The culprit's dead

500
00:41:43,997 --> 00:41:45,599
My mom started the fire

501
00:41:49,386 --> 00:41:50,630
It's not her first time

502
00:41:51,128 --> 00:41:54,424
Mom! Mom, get up! Mom!

503
00:41:55,783 --> 00:41:59,009
Mom, get up!

504
00:42:01,609 --> 00:42:02,723
Mom!

505
00:42:05,636 --> 00:42:06,794
Mom, I'm leaving

506
00:42:15,009 --> 00:42:17,229
Mom, mom!

507
00:42:36,646 --> 00:42:40,151
I thought
I should let her go at some point

508
00:42:43,542 --> 00:42:45,944
When she woke up, she felt sorry for me...

509
00:42:47,733 --> 00:42:50,142
but regretted that she
didn't die the next day

510
00:42:53,639 --> 00:42:55,724
I was so scared she might die...

511
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:00,547
but she was scared that she survived

512
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:05,248
At some point,
whenever I left for school...

513
00:43:05,642 --> 00:43:06,723
Oh...

514
00:43:09,529 --> 00:43:12,415
It may be my last exchange with my mom...

515
00:43:14,813 --> 00:43:16,335
That's what I thought

516
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:22,942
There was the only thing
I could do for her

517
00:43:30,443 --> 00:43:31,896
There is something about your house

518
00:43:32,584 --> 00:43:34,292
I don't usually talk about this...

519
00:43:37,686 --> 00:43:38,898
I'll help you...

520
00:43:41,666 --> 00:43:42,768
whatever it is

521
00:43:46,198 --> 00:43:48,410
Anything I can do, no...

522
00:43:50,811 --> 00:43:51,988
even if it's something I can't do

523
00:43:58,070 --> 00:43:59,230
Thanks, Hwan

524
00:44:01,370 --> 00:44:02,532
Hwan

525
00:45:21,788 --> 00:45:35,097
Changjun,
thanks for telling me how you feel

526
00:45:35,098 --> 00:45:50,020
I didn't know you liked me for so long

527
00:45:50,021 --> 00:45:54,468
Whenever you call me "Eunjoo"

528
00:45:58,108 --> 00:46:00,928
The Seventh Songho Scholarship Foundation
Changjun Kim, Eunjoo Kim

529
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:06,370
My mom used to have a crush on your father

530
00:46:12,514 --> 00:46:15,572
Whenever you call me
"Eunjoo," my heart pounds

531
00:46:17,434 --> 00:46:27,792
I must like you a lot, too

532
00:47:34,679 --> 00:47:36,656
There's something I must tell you

533
00:47:38,645 --> 00:47:43,343
I'll put it in my
second favorite thing after you

534
00:47:45,607 --> 00:47:46,675
Please find it

535
00:47:50,094 --> 00:47:51,446
Her favorite thing?

536
00:48:15,974 --> 00:48:17,099
Hwan

537
00:48:17,808 --> 00:48:19,643
- Oh, you're in this class?
- Yeah

538
00:48:20,701 --> 00:48:22,435
Great, where are you sitting?

539
00:48:35,336 --> 00:48:37,500
- Stop eating, stop
- Jeha

540
00:48:38,693 --> 00:48:40,609
What? Already finished your lunch?

541
00:48:40,610 --> 00:48:42,764
Our lunchtime is 30 minutes ahead of yours

542
00:48:42,765 --> 00:48:44,387
Go queue up. It's bulgogi today

543
00:48:44,388 --> 00:48:46,612
- You should've waited for me a little
- Whew

544
00:48:46,613 --> 00:48:48,007
Are you pissed again, our junior high?

545
00:48:48,390 --> 00:48:49,486
Junior high student?

546
00:48:51,081 --> 00:48:52,472
I don't see any junior high student here

547
00:48:52,767 --> 00:48:55,699
There are only high schoolers here.
Where's he, but here!

548
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:56,967
He's here!

549
00:48:58,632 --> 00:48:59,847
He's here

550
00:48:59,848 --> 00:49:01,659
Hey, junior high, clean this up

551
00:49:02,138 --> 00:49:03,629
Come on, quickly

552
00:49:04,238 --> 00:49:05,670
And let's play a game of basketball

553
00:49:05,671 --> 00:49:06,845
I'll be the referee

554
00:49:06,846 --> 00:49:08,398
- Fine
- I'm down

555
00:49:08,399 --> 00:49:10,029
- I'm not good at basketball...
- What should we bet on?

556
00:49:10,546 --> 00:49:12,319
How about the losing team
prevent the elderly from lying down?

557
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,160
- Ok!
- That sounds good

558
00:49:14,161 --> 00:49:15,556
We'll wait for you tomorrow

559
00:49:16,171 --> 00:49:17,470
Enjoy your lunch

560
00:49:18,379 --> 00:49:19,734
Guys!

561
00:49:22,067 --> 00:49:23,165
Hey, Jeha Jeon

562
00:49:26,163 --> 00:49:27,960
You're the only junior high student here

563
00:49:27,961 --> 00:49:29,980
Why would high schoolers hang out with you?

564
00:49:30,655 --> 00:49:31,716
Huh?

565
00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:34,115
What? Are you scared?

566
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:36,435
I didn't do anything

567
00:49:39,552 --> 00:49:41,626
Do you lie to my dad that I bully you

568
00:49:41,627 --> 00:49:42,729
with that face?

569
00:49:43,858 --> 00:49:44,930
Hey

570
00:49:45,623 --> 00:49:48,667
Quit messing around just
because my dad likes you these days

571
00:49:49,470 --> 00:49:50,784
Whatever you do...

572
00:49:51,277 --> 00:49:53,607
your mom will never be my mom

573
00:49:54,301 --> 00:49:56,378
You'll never be my dad's son

574
00:50:02,825 --> 00:50:04,076
It splashed on your uniform a lot

575
00:50:06,018 --> 00:50:07,764
That's two for you. Eat up

576
00:50:41,772 --> 00:50:44,086
Come to the snack bar after basketball

577
00:51:14,581 --> 00:51:15,696
Attention

578
00:51:16,321 --> 00:51:17,481
Bow to the teacher

579
00:51:17,665 --> 00:51:19,315
- Hello
- Hello

580
00:51:23,338 --> 00:51:25,341
Why did you ignore my message?

581
00:51:26,477 --> 00:51:28,639
- Who's he?
- What's wrong with him?

582
00:51:29,972 --> 00:51:30,988
Hey, junior high

583
00:51:31,627 --> 00:51:33,315
Did you eat something wrong this morning?

584
00:51:34,838 --> 00:51:35,914
Sir

585
00:51:36,392 --> 00:51:37,427
What?

586
00:51:38,126 --> 00:51:41,451
- Can we all have recess at the same time?
- No

587
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,507
You think the school's your playground?

588
00:51:43,508 --> 00:51:44,522
Hold them higher

589
00:51:45,735 --> 00:51:47,710
The ultimate end of the edgelord

590
00:52:01,813 --> 00:52:03,089
Yes, come in

591
00:52:11,505 --> 00:52:13,524
- Hello
- Yes, take a seat

592
00:52:19,122 --> 00:52:20,535
I know why you're here

593
00:52:21,524 --> 00:52:25,680
- You need to leave early for your father's campaign?
- Yes

594
00:52:25,681 --> 00:52:27,292
Yes, there's something to learn there

595
00:52:27,293 --> 00:52:29,462
A very important life lesson

596
00:52:30,471 --> 00:52:31,512
Oh, did you notice?

597
00:52:32,724 --> 00:52:36,404
Thanks to you, the orchid grew this much

598
00:52:37,203 --> 00:52:39,606
Even plants that are unaware

599
00:52:39,607 --> 00:52:42,212
show their good sides when loved

600
00:52:42,905 --> 00:52:45,516
Even more so if it's a human

601
00:52:52,452 --> 00:52:53,460
Until when...

602
00:52:54,389 --> 00:52:56,684
should I care for the orchid?

603
00:52:58,364 --> 00:52:59,985
The midterm exam is approaching

604
00:53:08,588 --> 00:53:10,776
What was my father like?

605
00:53:12,713 --> 00:53:13,906
When he was at school

606
00:53:16,398 --> 00:53:17,613
- Hello
- I'm number four

607
00:53:18,103 --> 00:53:19,214
Hello

608
00:53:19,846 --> 00:53:22,317
Hello, I'm candidate number four. Hello

609
00:53:22,936 --> 00:53:23,892
Oh

610
00:53:27,817 --> 00:53:30,453
- He was like you
- The economy is terrible

611
00:53:30,454 --> 00:53:31,656
- He was kind, upright...
- It must be hard

612
00:53:32,415 --> 00:53:33,467
and delicate

613
00:53:33,468 --> 00:53:34,912
Yes, thank you

614
00:53:35,433 --> 00:53:37,713
- Let me say he was an interesting student to look after
- Tasty, isn't it?

615
00:53:38,892 --> 00:53:40,116
- Yes, it's really good
- It's more correct to say...

616
00:53:40,902 --> 00:53:45,092
he bore fruit as much as he was cared for

617
00:53:45,093 --> 00:53:46,345
Thank you

618
00:53:46,346 --> 00:53:48,244
- Yes, wish you the best
- Yes, thank you

619
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:50,232
- Please give me your support
- Ok

620
00:53:50,629 --> 00:53:51,711
Candidate number four

621
00:54:01,891 --> 00:54:03,399
The Seventh Songho Scholarship Foundation
Seonghun Kim, Changjun Kim

622
00:54:14,986 --> 00:54:16,076
Oh!

623
00:54:16,987 --> 00:54:18,557
We've met during the resident meeting

624
00:54:25,672 --> 00:54:27,541
He's number four.
Look forward to your support

625
00:54:31,846 --> 00:54:34,832
He had a similar circle of friends to you

626
00:54:35,986 --> 00:54:37,709
I remember him being close...

627
00:54:38,538 --> 00:54:40,583
to a small group of friends

628
00:55:03,239 --> 00:55:04,603
When are you coming again?

629
00:55:06,374 --> 00:55:07,986
Doesn't that depend on you?

630
00:55:11,589 --> 00:55:12,991
Are you angry at me?

631
00:55:18,462 --> 00:55:20,714
Can't you at least try to understand...

632
00:55:21,727 --> 00:55:23,037
why I'm like this?

633
00:55:25,252 --> 00:55:26,309
Haru

634
00:55:26,914 --> 00:55:28,140
Do you remember that day?

635
00:55:29,031 --> 00:55:32,505
After that incident, you asked
whether you're good or bad

636
00:55:32,506 --> 00:55:34,799
for three years straight, 24 hours a day

637
00:55:35,399 --> 00:55:38,688
Three of us had to
answer you for three years

638
00:55:38,689 --> 00:55:40,273
What more should we do?

639
00:55:41,732 --> 00:55:42,814
What's going on?

640
00:55:43,201 --> 00:55:44,243
What's going on here?

641
00:55:55,357 --> 00:55:56,868
I'm sick of all this

642
00:55:59,932 --> 00:56:01,546
He's your brother. Try to be understanding

643
00:56:02,336 --> 00:56:04,574
Until when should we live like this?

644
00:56:05,401 --> 00:56:06,986
Haru's ill

645
00:56:14,267 --> 00:56:15,321
Yeah

646
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:19,615
I think my family's upset because of me

647
00:56:23,905 --> 00:56:25,215
Yeah, because of me

648
00:56:28,143 --> 00:56:30,382
I thought my brother would understand...

649
00:56:31,676 --> 00:56:32,889
Haru

650
00:56:34,378 --> 00:56:36,899
Haru, it's Mom

651
00:56:37,457 --> 00:56:38,959
- Open the door
- You're right

652
00:56:40,125 --> 00:56:42,149
Haru, open the door

653
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:43,358
I can be like this

654
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:47,069
- It's the only way I can survive, like you said
- Haru

655
00:56:47,843 --> 00:56:49,867
It's your mom. Open the door

656
00:56:59,385 --> 00:57:00,657
I don't think I can see you today

657
00:57:16,062 --> 00:57:17,146
What are you doing here alone?

658
00:57:24,933 --> 00:57:26,266
You still see them, right?

659
00:57:26,757 --> 00:57:28,162
It doesn't concern you

660
00:57:29,207 --> 00:57:31,293
If you care about Dogeon,
you shouldn't do this

661
00:57:32,703 --> 00:57:34,207
You know your brother's
going through a lot

662
00:57:34,703 --> 00:57:35,832
Even about the bike...

663
00:57:37,415 --> 00:57:39,374
I also don't want to do this!

664
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:43,724
If you continue seeing them...

665
00:57:44,814 --> 00:57:46,504
I can't help but call your brother

666
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:48,670
Who do you think you are?

667
00:57:49,473 --> 00:57:51,047
I'm not doing this for you...

668
00:57:52,854 --> 00:57:54,342
but I'm doing this for my friend

669
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:02,032
Get lost

670
00:58:03,325 --> 00:58:05,025
You're just an orphan

671
00:58:27,466 --> 00:58:29,555
Dohyeon's still seeing those friends

672
00:58:29,556 --> 00:58:31,140
I caught him on his way out

673
00:58:54,032 --> 00:58:55,446
Bus number 87
In front of Munhyeon-si Siyoung Apartment

674
00:58:56,772 --> 00:58:59,720
Munhyeon-si Siyoung Apartment

675
00:59:14,291 --> 00:59:15,501
Are you taking the bus?

676
00:59:17,118 --> 00:59:18,204
Are you?

677
01:00:00,321 --> 01:00:01,453
You stay here

678
01:00:01,871 --> 01:00:02,966
Let's go

679
01:00:03,450 --> 01:00:05,576
- Start the engine
- Ok

680
01:00:24,785 --> 01:00:26,440
What are you doing? Do you...

681
01:00:26,441 --> 01:00:28,770
Jooan, sorry, but let's talk later

682
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:36,317
What the

683
01:00:36,905 --> 01:00:38,295
He just hung up on me

684
01:00:39,577 --> 01:00:41,212
- Run
- You thieves!

685
01:00:41,213 --> 01:00:43,310
- Run!
- You thieves!

686
01:00:52,643 --> 01:00:53,792
- Hurry
- Run

687
01:00:55,986 --> 01:00:57,301
Hey, you!

688
01:00:59,213 --> 01:01:00,419
Stop there!

689
01:01:00,849 --> 01:01:02,240
You, with the coat!

690
01:01:02,927 --> 01:01:04,010
Yes, is it 112?

691
01:01:04,011 --> 01:01:05,739
Some young vagrants

692
01:01:06,061 --> 01:01:07,693
broke in and stole all my money

693
01:01:07,694 --> 01:01:09,527
Yes, please come

694
01:01:11,223 --> 01:01:12,471
It wasn't me

695
01:01:13,649 --> 01:01:14,983
Where are you going, you little thief!

696
01:01:15,390 --> 01:01:16,616
Hey, hop in

697
01:01:18,071 --> 01:01:19,285
Hop in quick!

698
01:01:19,286 --> 01:01:20,570
You thieves!

699
01:01:21,888 --> 01:01:24,498
You morons!

700
01:01:36,104 --> 01:01:37,649
I'll do it

701
01:01:41,254 --> 01:01:42,277
We're wearing the same clothes

702
01:01:47,661 --> 01:01:49,009
You live in A-dong,
Mokryeon Mansion, right?

703
01:01:49,621 --> 01:01:50,806
I live in C-dong

704
01:01:58,514 --> 01:01:59,650
I don't smoke

705
01:02:03,706 --> 01:02:06,100
Let's go home together.
I'll give you a ride

706
01:02:07,679 --> 01:02:08,883
Forget it

707
01:02:10,674 --> 01:02:12,340
Your chat ID is Anpanman, right?

708
01:02:12,836 --> 01:02:14,087
Not "pan", but with two Bs

709
01:02:14,998 --> 01:02:16,109
I'll message you

710
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:36,837
When you get hit, don't block with your arms.
Dodge it

711
01:02:37,446 --> 01:02:38,731
Or else, you'll end up like me

712
01:02:45,983 --> 01:02:47,836
I should've held back

713
01:02:48,726 --> 01:02:50,570
Seems like Dohyeon
didn't plan to go out today

714
01:02:51,052 --> 01:02:52,213
Forget it

715
01:02:53,531 --> 01:02:54,685
Anyway...

716
01:02:57,615 --> 01:03:00,152
how's your narcolepsy?

717
01:03:01,775 --> 01:03:03,047
It's alright

718
01:03:04,748 --> 01:03:06,470
It will get better

719
01:03:06,471 --> 01:03:08,170
I wouldn't be like this forever

720
01:03:10,881 --> 01:03:12,105
Right

721
01:03:12,909 --> 01:03:14,668
- I'll get going
- Bye

722
01:03:30,838 --> 01:03:32,045
Are you out of your mind?

723
01:03:32,426 --> 01:03:33,602
You know who they are?

724
01:03:34,074 --> 01:03:36,510
They're the one who turned you like this!

725
01:03:38,144 --> 01:03:39,522
Hosu Jeong, darn it!

726
01:03:40,408 --> 01:03:41,559
Hey, Dohyeon Kim

727
01:03:42,176 --> 01:03:43,419
He's my friend...

728
01:03:44,113 --> 01:03:45,321
not yours

729
01:03:46,534 --> 01:03:48,722
- How dare you!
- You think you're the only one with friends?

730
01:03:49,937 --> 01:03:51,579
They're my friends, too

731
01:03:52,481 --> 01:03:55,166
- They're my bros!
- They're not your friends

732
01:03:56,185 --> 01:03:57,962
Get hold of yourself!

733
01:03:58,750 --> 01:04:00,131
Your friend, too

734
01:04:02,050 --> 01:04:04,709
He's also a pathological liar

735
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:06,875
- What are you talking about?
- Your friend

736
01:04:08,201 --> 01:04:09,554
That orphan

737
01:04:10,977 --> 01:04:12,358
He's a straight up liar

738
01:04:13,596 --> 01:04:14,687
Hey

739
01:04:15,790 --> 01:04:17,628
I told you not to talk about him like that

740
01:04:39,169 --> 01:04:40,169
Narcolepsy?

741
01:04:41,285 --> 01:04:42,757
He's not even taking his medications

742
01:04:43,643 --> 01:04:44,862
He throws it all away!

743
01:04:45,278 --> 01:04:46,664
I saw it myself!

744
01:05:21,595 --> 01:05:22,815
You can go

745
01:05:40,227 --> 01:05:43,731
Yangji Orphanage

746
01:05:43,732 --> 01:05:46,489
Chugga chugga choo choo!

747
01:05:48,777 --> 01:05:50,213
Why are you all by yourself?

748
01:05:51,408 --> 01:05:56,281
We oppose the redevelopment

749
01:07:16,340 --> 01:07:18,816
- Please tell us how you feel about winning the election
- What are your plans now?
