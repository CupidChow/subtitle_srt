00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:17,450
Dogeon's Resume / High School Dropout

3
00:00:19,433 --> 00:00:20,983
Naeri Gas Station / Family / Poverty
Oh, boy...

4
00:00:20,984 --> 00:00:23,518
Part time job / Container

5
00:00:24,188 --> 00:00:26,304
There is no ship work for a while

6
00:00:27,668 --> 00:00:28,832
and day labor, well

7
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:30,222
it just doesn't pay enough,
which you don't like

8
00:00:31,822 --> 00:00:34,610
See? Even if they say they
don't care about education

9
00:00:34,611 --> 00:00:37,040
a junior high grad,
it's kinda tricky

10
00:00:38,253 --> 00:00:40,231
Why did you drop out of school?

11
00:00:41,586 --> 00:00:43,293
If you get any ship work later

12
00:00:43,613 --> 00:00:45,303
Could you please give me a call?

13
00:00:47,148 --> 00:00:48,253
Yeah, I will

14
00:00:49,418 --> 00:00:50,451
Yes

15
00:00:51,054 --> 00:00:52,092
Thank you

16
00:02:01,113 --> 00:02:02,252
Nanyoung

17
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,675
You shouldn't talk like that

18
00:02:04,941 --> 00:02:06,760
For brother's sake, I don't
even charge you the rent

19
00:02:07,003 --> 00:02:08,051
instead, I asked you
to manage the building

20
00:02:08,051 --> 00:02:09,426
- That's all I asked for
- Right

21
00:02:09,734 --> 00:02:10,753
About that rent

22
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,690
you don't charge that fancy rent

23
00:02:12,691 --> 00:02:14,162
but you come here all the time

24
00:02:14,163 --> 00:02:15,369
checking if the cleaning's done right

25
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:16,459
and being on a power trip?

26
00:02:17,072 --> 00:02:18,081
Mom, Mom

27
00:02:18,733 --> 00:02:19,763
Aunt

28
00:02:20,141 --> 00:02:21,947
- If there's an issue, talk to me about it
- Power trip?

29
00:02:22,216 --> 00:02:23,440
You just said 'power trip'?

30
00:02:23,828 --> 00:02:25,276
The real power tripper here

31
00:02:25,277 --> 00:02:26,360
is you!

32
00:02:26,885 --> 00:02:28,097
Using your sick brother

33
00:02:28,098 --> 00:02:29,869
to demand this and that

34
00:02:30,258 --> 00:02:31,397
Have you given anything?

35
00:02:31,398 --> 00:02:32,646
Say after giving me something.
Give it first!

36
00:02:33,576 --> 00:02:35,471
Or return the money that

37
00:02:35,472 --> 00:02:36,647
Dogeon's dad gave you when you married

38
00:02:36,648 --> 00:02:38,332
I'll leave if you pay that

39
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:40,497
Mom, just go inside, okay?

40
00:02:41,587 --> 00:02:43,557
I'll give you that fancy money

41
00:02:44,115 --> 00:02:45,774
the one you keep bringing up all the time

42
00:02:45,775 --> 00:02:46,830
that fancy 5 million won

43
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,218
Aunt, I'm sorry

44
00:02:51,057 --> 00:02:52,362
I'll start taking care of

45
00:02:52,363 --> 00:02:54,323
- cleaning this building too
- Forget it

46
00:02:54,999 --> 00:02:56,416
Dogeon, I'm sorry but

47
00:02:57,775 --> 00:02:59,584
I've been holding back for brother's sake

48
00:03:00,671 --> 00:03:01,743
I'll transfer that 5 million won

49
00:03:01,744 --> 00:03:02,993
to brother's account today

50
00:03:04,146 --> 00:03:05,308
Let's not see each other anymore

51
00:03:07,433 --> 00:03:08,683
Oh my

52
00:03:08,684 --> 00:03:10,745
you think I'd be scared
if you tell me to stop seeing each other?

53
00:03:11,376 --> 00:03:12,448
Aunt

54
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,072
You

55
00:03:28,512 --> 00:03:29,643
Why are you looking at me like that?

56
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:31,871
You heard everything too

57
00:03:32,321 --> 00:03:33,359
about the money your dad gave

58
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,366
That fancy money

59
00:03:34,367 --> 00:03:35,346
5 million won

60
00:03:36,223 --> 00:03:38,061
Take that money and find a place

61
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:39,834
Living like this

62
00:03:39,835 --> 00:03:41,667
I'm just fed up

63
00:03:51,146 --> 00:03:52,159
Mom

64
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:56,743
Do you even know

65
00:03:59,015 --> 00:04:00,510
how much rent would be
for a 5 million won deposit?

66
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:02,200
You have money

67
00:04:03,026 --> 00:04:04,135
from working on the ship

68
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:06,262
and working all night with the delivery

69
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,262
That's for...

70
00:04:11,491 --> 00:04:12,956
- When I go to college...
- How can you

71
00:04:14,398 --> 00:04:16,356
only think of yourself

72
00:04:16,952 --> 00:04:18,201
after seeing your mom
suffer such an insult?

73
00:04:41,719 --> 00:04:42,780
Hello?

74
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,164
Oh, I'm sorry

75
00:04:46,984 --> 00:04:48,171
It's raining so hard

76
00:04:48,172 --> 00:04:49,182
I'll hurry over

77
00:04:50,352 --> 00:04:51,431
Hello?

78
00:06:20,543 --> 00:06:21,588
What's wrong?

79
00:06:22,695 --> 00:06:24,062
If you're coming in, then come

80
00:06:24,063 --> 00:06:25,298
What are you doing standing there?

81
00:06:39,378 --> 00:06:40,405
What is it?

82
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:45,631
Why the bankbook?

83
00:06:51,258 --> 00:06:52,413
Please save me

84
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,524
Mom

85
00:06:58,189 --> 00:06:59,222
What?

86
00:07:00,067 --> 00:07:01,147
Save what?

87
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:04,706
Mom

88
00:07:07,082 --> 00:07:08,102
That's...

89
00:07:10,453 --> 00:07:11,745
all I have

90
00:07:14,673 --> 00:07:16,128
This is it

91
00:07:19,528 --> 00:07:20,562
But

92
00:07:23,395 --> 00:07:25,318
I don't want to live and die like this

93
00:07:27,775 --> 00:07:29,277
I hate it more than death

94
00:07:42,247 --> 00:07:43,310
Please...

95
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:48,407
save me

96
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:23,080
Dogeon!

97
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:25,166
- Let's eat
- Oh, yes

98
00:08:26,983 --> 00:08:28,439
Take it easy

99
00:08:28,933 --> 00:08:30,164
You hated struggling to survive

100
00:08:30,165 --> 00:08:31,189
and ran away

101
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:33,558
but why are you still hustling even here?

102
00:08:33,658 --> 00:08:35,195
Maybe I've got a servant's
mindset or something

103
00:08:35,953 --> 00:08:38,065
Anyway, once I save up some money

104
00:08:38,067 --> 00:08:39,458
I'll stop being a burden and move out

105
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:41,058
I never asked you to come back

106
00:08:41,058 --> 00:08:42,520
and I never told you to leave as well, man

107
00:08:42,972 --> 00:08:44,305
- Let's eat
- Okay

108
00:08:57,404 --> 00:08:58,661
Hey, Jooan

109
00:09:01,168 --> 00:09:02,262
It's been a while

110
00:09:07,352 --> 00:09:08,386
Hello?

111
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:11,814
Jooan?

112
00:09:12,197 --> 00:09:13,223
Dogeon!

113
00:09:15,143 --> 00:09:16,170
I miss you

114
00:09:28,878 --> 00:09:31,463
Jooan / Domestic Violence / Left Ear

115
00:09:31,464 --> 00:09:33,818
Alcohol / Nightmares / Rule breaker

116
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,941
I'm staying at the gas station

117
00:09:40,901 --> 00:09:41,920
I know

118
00:09:43,027 --> 00:09:44,305
Saw you passing by

119
00:09:45,773 --> 00:09:47,061
But why didn't you call me?

120
00:09:47,942 --> 00:09:48,943
You should've called me

121
00:09:52,352 --> 00:09:53,614
You didn't contact me either

122
00:10:00,889 --> 00:10:01,942
Oh, is it?

123
00:10:02,803 --> 00:10:03,890
Do you contact him these days?

124
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,379
No

125
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:08,940
I don't want to be a burden to him...

126
00:10:10,514 --> 00:10:11,534
like before

127
00:10:23,861 --> 00:10:24,896
Jooan!

128
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:27,557
Jooan?

129
00:10:54,749 --> 00:10:55,893
My son

130
00:10:56,045 --> 00:10:57,125
Let's eat

131
00:11:02,758 --> 00:11:03,898
Try this

132
00:11:04,061 --> 00:11:05,877
You liked this
dinosaur chicken, don't you?

133
00:11:07,668 --> 00:11:08,735
Yeah

134
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:11,007
Just in case you come, Mom never

135
00:11:11,008 --> 00:11:12,244
makes it run out

136
00:11:12,882 --> 00:11:14,336
The freezer's full of it

137
00:11:21,385 --> 00:11:22,415
Try

138
00:11:23,545 --> 00:11:24,550
I...

139
00:11:25,428 --> 00:11:26,453
I'll eat by myself

140
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:27,978
Yes, sure

141
00:11:28,537 --> 00:11:30,758
Take your time and
eat as much as you want

142
00:11:32,393 --> 00:11:33,522
Let's eat, Mom

143
00:11:33,788 --> 00:11:35,190
Yeah, let's eat

144
00:11:44,856 --> 00:11:45,889
Try this

145
00:12:11,228 --> 00:12:12,570
Thank you for the meal

146
00:12:15,036 --> 00:12:16,070
Jooan

147
00:12:16,721 --> 00:12:18,046
Here we are, the three of us

148
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,369
eat together

149
00:12:19,798 --> 00:12:22,139
and I take care of your birthday, too

150
00:12:22,683 --> 00:12:24,688
How about living with me like this?

151
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:40,272
I want

152
00:12:42,002 --> 00:12:43,481
to make up for everything

153
00:12:43,482 --> 00:12:45,329
I couldn't do for you

154
00:12:46,587 --> 00:12:47,605
Because I'm sorry...

155
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:52,291
Mom

156
00:12:56,129 --> 00:12:57,270
I'll go now

157
00:12:58,678 --> 00:12:59,744
Jooan

158
00:13:03,332 --> 00:13:04,639
You said

159
00:13:04,823 --> 00:13:06,068
we don't have a father anymore

160
00:13:07,018 --> 00:13:08,921
didn't you?

161
00:13:11,689 --> 00:13:12,923
Stay with us

162
00:13:21,049 --> 00:13:22,634
You can come here

163
00:13:23,066 --> 00:13:24,294
anytime you want

164
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:26,731
The front door code is your birthday

165
00:13:52,696 --> 00:13:53,835
Where have you been wandering around

166
00:13:53,836 --> 00:13:54,848
and only coming home now?

167
00:13:56,132 --> 00:13:57,161
Why?

168
00:13:58,951 --> 00:14:00,059
Did your mom ask you to check

169
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,141
if I'm dead?

170
00:14:09,276 --> 00:14:10,599
You little bastard

171
00:14:11,819 --> 00:14:13,203
staring like that

172
00:14:13,803 --> 00:14:15,006
such a bad kid

173
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,616
You stay right there where you are

174
00:14:18,617 --> 00:14:20,092
I need to get up

175
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:21,657
Stay there

176
00:14:22,176 --> 00:14:23,387
Stay put

177
00:14:23,501 --> 00:14:24,707
I met Mom

178
00:14:27,517 --> 00:14:28,860
went to her place

179
00:14:30,481 --> 00:14:32,134
and ate the meal she prepared

180
00:14:36,617 --> 00:14:37,921
Mom asked me to live with her

181
00:14:41,045 --> 00:14:42,216
I want that too

182
00:14:45,795 --> 00:14:46,820
Then

183
00:14:50,613 --> 00:14:52,408
you'll die alone here

184
00:14:56,296 --> 00:14:57,414
But

185
00:15:00,371 --> 00:15:02,323
I really hate

186
00:15:07,459 --> 00:15:09,352
to see you dying alone

187
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:14,562
in this coffin-like house

188
00:15:25,074 --> 00:15:26,530
So come with me

189
00:15:27,864 --> 00:15:29,035
Me

190
00:15:30,442 --> 00:15:31,552
Sister

191
00:15:32,146 --> 00:15:33,288
and Mom

192
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:40,115
we can't help you anymore

193
00:15:43,974 --> 00:15:45,556
So come with me

194
00:15:54,105 --> 00:15:55,914
Answer by the count of three

195
00:15:58,133 --> 00:15:59,443
If I leave today

196
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,508
I won't come back here ever

197
00:16:15,473 --> 00:16:16,596
For real

198
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:20,915
One

199
00:16:25,952 --> 00:16:27,022
Two

200
00:17:00,991 --> 00:17:02,163
Three

201
00:18:06,566 --> 00:18:07,890
What are you doing, Dad?

202
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,603
Speak up

203
00:18:11,095 --> 00:18:12,612
That you told me earlier

204
00:18:15,184 --> 00:18:16,455
you'll cut down on drinking,

205
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:17,724
go to the hospital,

206
00:18:17,725 --> 00:18:19,418
and get treatment

207
00:18:31,707 --> 00:18:33,872
Dad also told me

208
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,589
he wanted to

209
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:37,429
live together again like before

210
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:40,214
and

211
00:18:41,103 --> 00:18:42,331
he was sorry

212
00:18:52,869 --> 00:18:54,773
He also says that

213
00:18:55,429 --> 00:18:56,443
he wants to start over

214
00:19:03,192 --> 00:19:04,408
So do I

215
00:19:17,248 --> 00:19:19,513
Is your Mom going to live with Dad?

216
00:19:21,696 --> 00:19:22,707
Don't know

217
00:19:23,945 --> 00:19:25,442
They didn't say a word
to each other that day

218
00:19:26,753 --> 00:19:28,606
Well, it's not like Mom would just say yes

219
00:19:28,607 --> 00:19:30,160
to live together from the start

220
00:19:35,789 --> 00:19:37,792
It's Mom's birthday in a few days

221
00:19:38,795 --> 00:19:39,813
so I'm thinking of buying a cake

222
00:19:39,814 --> 00:19:40,959
and going over with Dad

223
00:19:44,981 --> 00:19:46,347
- Mom
- It's okay, it's okay

224
00:19:46,348 --> 00:19:47,392
Open the door!

225
00:19:47,393 --> 00:19:48,534
- Stop it!
- Open the door!

226
00:19:48,535 --> 00:19:50,719
You won't open the door? Open it, now!

227
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,637
Open it, right now

228
00:19:54,638 --> 00:19:55,742
You two

229
00:19:55,743 --> 00:19:57,005
after I die

230
00:19:57,006 --> 00:19:58,695
are you planning to live happily together?

231
00:19:58,846 --> 00:20:00,007
Open it!

232
00:20:00,479 --> 00:20:02,048
Open it, open it!

233
00:20:02,324 --> 00:20:03,395
Open the door!

234
00:20:04,496 --> 00:20:05,601
Open the door!

235
00:20:05,602 --> 00:20:06,648
Open the door, now

236
00:20:06,649 --> 00:20:08,246
Dad!

237
00:20:11,428 --> 00:20:12,612
What are you doing?

238
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,604
Put the knife down

239
00:20:17,548 --> 00:20:18,975
Put that down!

240
00:20:19,586 --> 00:20:21,038
Open the door, open it!

241
00:20:21,861 --> 00:20:23,946
- Put the knife down!
- Let go of this

242
00:20:24,107 --> 00:20:25,113
Let go!

243
00:20:25,341 --> 00:20:27,372
Let go of this!

244
00:22:36,066 --> 00:22:39,068
Ah, stop, I told you to stop

245
00:22:40,106 --> 00:22:41,679
I told you to stop

246
00:22:42,733 --> 00:22:44,427
How many times did I tell you to stop?

247
00:22:44,911 --> 00:22:46,201
I told you to stop...

248
00:22:46,357 --> 00:22:47,974
Oh, Dad

249
00:23:04,484 --> 00:23:06,040
Well...

250
00:23:07,881 --> 00:23:09,335
- Uh...
- No

251
00:23:09,773 --> 00:23:10,862
I...

252
00:23:13,846 --> 00:23:14,879
I...

253
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,898
stabbed

254
00:23:20,052 --> 00:23:21,182
my dad

255
00:23:22,761 --> 00:23:23,818
Yes

256
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,269
it's true

257
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:33,862
Please help

258
00:23:35,388 --> 00:23:36,459
Please help

259
00:23:37,532 --> 00:23:38,611
It's

260
00:23:41,617 --> 00:23:42,822
my mom's place

261
00:23:47,589 --> 00:23:48,818
Siyoung Apartment

262
00:23:48,819 --> 00:23:50,568
Siyoung Apartment 808

263
00:23:51,182 --> 00:23:52,250
Yes

264
00:23:52,637 --> 00:23:55,164
Yes, I'm here

265
00:23:55,165 --> 00:23:56,268
Yes!

266
00:24:35,287 --> 00:24:36,442
Bro

267
00:24:43,246 --> 00:24:46,662
Jooan, what should we do...

268
00:24:47,429 --> 00:24:49,493
- Ahh, what to do!
- I miss you

269
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,843
Haru
How did this happen?

270
00:25:15,684 --> 00:25:19,285
Parents / Noah's Raven

271
00:25:19,286 --> 00:25:20,485
It's not a symptom

272
00:25:20,486 --> 00:25:21,918
but it seems like a show of will

273
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:22,895
Hospitalization / Trauma

274
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:24,109
It's not enough to call it self-harm

275
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:26,295
as he does only to the extent
that it’s not life-threatening

276
00:25:26,296 --> 00:25:27,563
and then

277
00:25:29,386 --> 00:25:31,195
pretends not to remember

278
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,256
the questions

279
00:25:32,505 --> 00:25:33,572
he's clearly capable of answering

280
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:35,164
It suggests that

281
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:36,980
Haru is not

282
00:25:36,981 --> 00:25:38,375
really wanting to die

283
00:25:39,053 --> 00:25:40,987
but rather it seems like

284
00:25:40,988 --> 00:25:42,464
he believes he still needs to be here

285
00:25:45,174 --> 00:25:46,226
Haru

286
00:25:49,208 --> 00:25:50,211
Are you

287
00:25:50,988 --> 00:25:52,206
scared of

288
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:53,846
going outside?

289
00:25:56,185 --> 00:25:57,199
Do you really

290
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,334
want to stay here so badly

291
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:01,726
that you're causing these incidents?

292
00:26:12,882 --> 00:26:14,111
For 10 years

293
00:26:14,267 --> 00:26:16,627
do you know what Mom
and Dad's prayer has been?

294
00:26:18,611 --> 00:26:19,752
For our Haru to live

295
00:26:19,753 --> 00:26:22,121
just like any normal kids

296
00:26:24,757 --> 00:26:26,749
Mom and Dad will help you, Haru

297
00:26:31,151 --> 00:26:32,255
let's overcome

298
00:26:32,586 --> 00:26:33,950
this together

299
00:27:08,755 --> 00:27:10,284
Again, Mom and Dad, right?

300
00:27:10,621 --> 00:27:11,650
Eh?

301
00:27:11,905 --> 00:27:13,055
I don't think so

302
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:33,494
Hosu / Narcolepsy / Attention

303
00:27:33,495 --> 00:27:35,112
Orphanage / Blame myself

304
00:27:36,998 --> 00:27:38,022
Are you okay?

305
00:27:41,814 --> 00:27:43,279
I regretted

306
00:27:44,982 --> 00:27:46,011
what I said to you before

307
00:27:50,431 --> 00:27:51,489
Ah, it's not because of that

308
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:52,875
I didn't come to see you

309
00:27:54,271 --> 00:27:55,702
I've just been busy

310
00:27:56,441 --> 00:27:57,485
Sorry

311
00:27:58,276 --> 00:27:59,379
Hey, as you know

312
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:01,508
I'm like a social king even
among social butterflies

313
00:28:04,142 --> 00:28:05,160
Yeah, right

314
00:28:06,014 --> 00:28:07,604
Everyone likes you

315
00:28:08,952 --> 00:28:10,457
Exactly

316
00:28:10,695 --> 00:28:12,662
Everyone likes me too much

317
00:28:13,626 --> 00:28:14,662
Oh, right

318
00:28:15,227 --> 00:28:17,182
Recently, I'm staying at

319
00:28:17,183 --> 00:28:19,254
the youth shelter near your apartment

320
00:28:22,103 --> 00:28:23,246
What time is it now?

321
00:28:25,211 --> 00:28:27,359
Ah, everyone must be waiting just for me

322
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,490
and not sleeping

323
00:28:28,491 --> 00:28:30,216
Ah, this popularity of mine, really...

324
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:31,715
Don't do it

325
00:28:32,587 --> 00:28:33,753
I said don't do it

326
00:28:34,873 --> 00:28:36,028
Told you not to do it

327
00:28:38,478 --> 00:28:39,533
Hey

328
00:28:40,502 --> 00:28:41,869
Why are you so late?

329
00:28:41,874 --> 00:28:42,958
I've been waiting

330
00:28:45,413 --> 00:28:46,539
I told you I don't have

331
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:47,579
any more grant money left

332
00:28:48,394 --> 00:28:49,410
No one asked you to give

333
00:28:49,929 --> 00:28:51,134
I'll pay you back

334
00:28:51,499 --> 00:28:52,678
I'm asking for a loan

335
00:28:55,328 --> 00:28:56,365
then pay me back 500,000 won

336
00:28:56,366 --> 00:28:57,671
you borrowed last time

337
00:28:58,604 --> 00:29:00,635
Ah, come on

338
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:03,222
So?

339
00:29:03,789 --> 00:29:04,931
You won't lend it to me?

340
00:29:08,271 --> 00:29:09,783
Then if I find something
after I search you

341
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:11,841
100 slaps for each cent?

342
00:29:13,352 --> 00:29:14,369
Hey

343
00:29:14,725 --> 00:29:15,773
Search him

344
00:29:16,306 --> 00:29:17,421
Don't do it

345
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:18,663
- Let me see
- I said don't do it

346
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,976
I told you not to go against me

347
00:29:25,977 --> 00:29:27,466
Hey, stop it and search

348
00:29:27,467 --> 00:29:28,496
Don't do it

349
00:29:28,651 --> 00:29:29,905
Dude, are you already sighing like that?

350
00:30:06,231 --> 00:30:08,806
Do you still think

351
00:30:09,741 --> 00:30:11,100
it's your fault

352
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:12,360
that your friend is still in the hospital?

353
00:30:14,417 --> 00:30:15,460
I don't know

354
00:30:18,649 --> 00:30:20,651
it might not be entirely my fault

355
00:30:23,445 --> 00:30:25,253
but I was the one who
brought them together

356
00:30:27,808 --> 00:30:29,831
Sometimes the stares of
strangers are hard to bear

357
00:30:32,541 --> 00:30:34,127
Feels like they are saying something to me

358
00:30:35,671 --> 00:30:36,989
Then I start to feel

359
00:30:39,129 --> 00:30:40,618
suffocated again

360
00:31:13,259 --> 00:31:15,264
I saw it when you changed your clothes

361
00:31:17,152 --> 00:31:18,311
You did that to yourself, right?

362
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,330
I do this so they won't discharge me

363
00:31:25,979 --> 00:31:28,381
Until I find another way

364
00:31:29,107 --> 00:31:30,300
Don't do that

365
00:31:32,572 --> 00:31:34,440
You can't live there forever

366
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:38,079
Let's find a way together

367
00:31:39,471 --> 00:31:40,839
Just until I turn twenty

368
00:31:42,814 --> 00:31:44,437
After my birthday this year

369
00:31:44,806 --> 00:31:46,012
I'll be able to do

370
00:31:46,013 --> 00:31:47,236
everything on my own

371
00:31:49,577 --> 00:31:51,271
Then I plan to
be discharged and leave the house

372
00:31:53,545 --> 00:31:54,864
Hiding

373
00:31:55,326 --> 00:31:57,023
I'm so tired of it

374
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,158
Hey

375
00:32:07,886 --> 00:32:10,111
don't feel pressured by
what I'm going to say

376
00:32:10,299 --> 00:32:12,153
if you don't like it, just say no

377
00:32:12,361 --> 00:32:13,414
I mean it, okay?

378
00:32:14,689 --> 00:32:15,850
What is it?

379
00:32:17,066 --> 00:32:18,631
Why are you trying to

380
00:32:18,632 --> 00:32:20,353
plant a seed, Haru Park?

381
00:32:23,185 --> 00:32:24,692
When I leave the house

382
00:32:27,892 --> 00:32:29,475
can I live

383
00:32:30,501 --> 00:32:32,599
with you?

384
00:32:38,768 --> 00:32:40,826
Totally possible, why not?

385
00:32:41,054 --> 00:32:42,087
Really?

386
00:32:43,192 --> 00:32:44,680
Can I really live with you?

387
00:32:46,001 --> 00:32:47,419
Then I'll also work part-time

388
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,533
for living expenses, rent

389
00:32:48,534 --> 00:32:49,653
I need to earn money too

390
00:32:49,654 --> 00:32:51,584
Haru, you are crossing the line again

391
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,467
Who told you to worry about that?

392
00:32:53,915 --> 00:32:56,148
You just focus on your treatment

393
00:32:56,655 --> 00:32:58,056
Then your super hero brother

394
00:32:58,057 --> 00:32:59,975
will prepare a place for us

395
00:33:00,367 --> 00:33:02,061
to live together before you're discharged

396
00:33:15,021 --> 00:33:18,917
Fire / Murderer / Mom

397
00:33:18,918 --> 00:33:22,792
Cein / Principal / Transfer

398
00:34:49,509 --> 00:34:50,612
Oh

399
00:34:51,085 --> 00:34:53,094
Cein, do you work here?

400
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,264
After you came looking for me that day

401
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:02,268
with such a bold declaration

402
00:35:02,963 --> 00:35:04,225
I thought my last years

403
00:35:04,556 --> 00:35:06,739
would be tainted with disgrace

404
00:35:07,481 --> 00:35:09,078
but it seems you're
crumbling all on your own

405
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:10,493
I worried for nothing

406
00:35:12,156 --> 00:35:14,438
If you're here to pay respects,
then do that and leave

407
00:35:16,347 --> 00:35:17,656
Are you scared?

408
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:19,630
Or maybe

409
00:35:19,966 --> 00:35:21,347
did you run away because

410
00:35:21,348 --> 00:35:23,393
you couldn't handle
the truths you'd find out?

411
00:35:31,624 --> 00:35:32,879
Still,

412
00:35:33,409 --> 00:35:34,725
I liked

413
00:35:34,879 --> 00:35:36,412
that look

414
00:35:36,413 --> 00:35:37,811
in your eyes that day

415
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,113
Right

416
00:35:44,228 --> 00:35:45,394
That look

417
00:35:47,352 --> 00:35:48,360
Those eyes

418
00:35:48,624 --> 00:35:51,025
which remind me

419
00:35:51,689 --> 00:35:52,956
Eunjoo back then

420
00:35:59,774 --> 00:36:01,065
Oh, really?

421
00:36:02,088 --> 00:36:03,096
Yes

422
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:18,660
Open it!

423
00:36:18,661 --> 00:36:20,276
Changjun Kim

424
00:36:20,277 --> 00:36:21,387
Open the door!

425
00:36:22,567 --> 00:36:23,890
Open the door!

426
00:36:26,178 --> 00:36:27,885
Ah, it's nothing

427
00:36:28,736 --> 00:36:30,464
Please continue, Mr. Kim

428
00:36:33,005 --> 00:36:34,115
Yes, yes

429
00:36:35,314 --> 00:36:36,542
Ah

430
00:36:37,393 --> 00:36:38,460
I see

431
00:36:39,129 --> 00:36:40,153
Yes

432
00:36:45,266 --> 00:36:47,090
Don't worry about that

433
00:36:47,952 --> 00:36:49,055
Yes, yes, yes

434
00:36:50,584 --> 00:36:52,577
Open the door! Open the door!

435
00:36:53,959 --> 00:36:55,117
Open it!

436
00:37:24,174 --> 00:37:25,305
Am I

437
00:37:28,254 --> 00:37:30,488
still not understanding you?

438
00:37:33,534 --> 00:37:34,952
I trusted you

439
00:37:37,174 --> 00:37:38,844
Is that why you end up like this?

440
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:44,345
I tried to understand

441
00:37:46,591 --> 00:37:48,808
that student's incident too

442
00:37:54,849 --> 00:37:55,962
but it's getting hard

443
00:37:58,841 --> 00:38:00,889
always seeing

444
00:38:04,058 --> 00:38:05,329
your dead mom in you

445
00:38:10,906 --> 00:38:11,945
That day

446
00:38:15,233 --> 00:38:16,584
was it really

447
00:38:18,975 --> 00:38:19,993
not you?

448
00:38:23,623 --> 00:38:24,703
That incident

449
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:34,950
That day, your mom's incident...

450
00:39:25,766 --> 00:39:26,794
I'm sorry

451
00:39:26,913 --> 00:39:28,514
Are you okay? I'm sorry

452
00:42:04,125 --> 00:42:05,263
Hey, is it a fire?

453
00:42:05,264 --> 00:42:06,551
- Hey, run, run!
- Hey, hey, hey

454
00:42:06,552 --> 00:42:07,752
Hey, isn't it a fire alarm?

455
00:42:09,548 --> 00:42:11,099
Hey, why are you running

456
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:12,592
Why are you running in the classroom?

457
00:42:12,645 --> 00:42:14,466
- The alarm
- Sit down, you guys, sit down

458
00:42:19,426 --> 00:42:21,648
Due to the school remodeling

459
00:42:21,649 --> 00:42:23,817
the fire alarm malfunctioned

460
00:42:23,818 --> 00:42:25,534
so don't even think about
sneaking out, okay?

461
00:42:25,651 --> 00:42:27,108
- Yes
- Yes

462
00:42:28,403 --> 00:42:30,893
Why are you holding
your bag, put it down, man

463
00:42:32,842 --> 00:42:33,900
You little...

00:45:40,491 --> 00:45:41,685

- Hey!

469
00:45:47,084 --> 00:45:48,162
Jooan is

470
00:45:48,693 --> 00:45:49,739
at the police station now

471
00:46:13,149 --> 00:46:15,326
Bro, it's me, Jeha

472
00:46:16,632 --> 00:46:17,879
Please answer my call

473
00:46:19,463 --> 00:46:21,418
Actually, that key you left behind

474
00:46:22,448 --> 00:46:23,807
I found something with it

475
00:46:25,767 --> 00:46:26,894
It's a bit weird

476
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:29,701
Today's incident with Jooan

477
00:46:29,988 --> 00:46:31,894
I think it might be related to this

478
00:46:35,256 --> 00:46:36,913
and there's something else too

479
00:46:38,388 --> 00:46:39,525

00:46:44,623 --> 00:46:45,625
I'm...

483
00:46:46,269 --> 00:46:47,317
scared

484
00:46:49,078 --> 00:46:50,172

00:46:53,794 --> 00:46:54,895

488
00:47:25,452 --> 00:47:26,491
Hello

489
00:47:26,856 --> 00:47:29,185
Is there a place called Ya Motel nearby?

490
00:47:31,486 --> 00:47:32,542
Sorry?

491
00:47:34,446 --> 00:47:36,015
Oh, hello

492
00:47:36,905 --> 00:47:38,779
I'm wondering if there's a Ya Motel...

493
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:41,226
Maybe near the mart...

494
00:48:04,618 --> 00:48:05,960
Is there a fire?

495
00:48:13,375 --> 00:48:14,795
- Why
- Did someone start it?

496
00:48:15,151 --> 00:48:16,213
- Yeah, exactly
- Eh?

497
00:48:16,557 --> 00:48:17,568
Someone's coming out

498
00:48:18,243 --> 00:48:19,907
Looks like someone's dead

499
00:48:20,247 --> 00:48:22,097
Oh my, oh my

500
00:48:22,446 --> 00:48:23,957
I think that person is dead

501
00:48:23,958 --> 00:48:24,968
Oh dear

502
00:48:26,249 --> 00:48:27,379
Who is it? Who's that?

503
00:48:27,999 --> 00:48:29,069
Isn't that person dead?

504
00:48:29,201 --> 00:48:30,253
Oh my

505
00:48:30,593 --> 00:48:31,642
Someone might be dead

506
00:48:32,194 --> 00:48:33,444
Is it because of the fire?

507
00:48:34,899 --> 00:48:37,563
Piano Bro

508
00:48:49,816 --> 00:48:51,880

Bro, please pick up the phone

510
00:49:01,963 --> 00:49:03,374
I'm really scared

511
00:49:06,475 --> 00:49:08,420
Feels like something bad
is going to happen

512
00:49:09,466 --> 00:49:10,818
I can't understand it

513
00:49:12,994 --> 00:49:14,004
but maybe

514
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,097
you will understand it

515
00:49:19,881 --> 00:49:20,920

532
00:51:43,207 --> 00:51:44,355
Eventually

533
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:45,582
you'll quit too

534
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:53,717
How about it?

535
00:51:55,224 --> 00:51:56,235
Do you

536
00:51:57,626 --> 00:51:59,077
want this to be your end?

537
00:52:00,762 --> 00:52:01,841
No

00:52:17,421 --> 00:52:19,455

00:53:21,898 --> 00:53:23,163
endless

546
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:10,890
Ah Bro!

547
00:54:10,891 --> 00:54:12,662
- Help!
- Hey!

548
00:54:15,999 --> 00:54:17,033
Hey

549
00:54:17,034 --> 00:54:18,378
Take it easy

550
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:20,917
That water is so dangerous

551
00:54:21,267 --> 00:54:22,487
That's what I mean

552
00:54:22,488 --> 00:54:23,587

553
00:54:23,588 --> 00:54:24,972

558
00:54:30,611 --> 00:54:31,765

559
00:55:29,314 --> 00:55:30,390
