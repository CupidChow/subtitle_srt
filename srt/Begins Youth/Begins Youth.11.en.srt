This series is based on a fictionalized story inspired by the story of BTS's album,
The Most Beautiful Moment in Life,
and is not related to BTS members and their families. Child actors and animals were filmed
in safe conditions under the supervision of their guardians.

00:00:19,976 --> 00:00:22,933
[06:12]

3
00:00:38,088 --> 00:00:39,178
It's all set for you

4
00:00:41,663 --> 00:00:42,720
Thank you

5
00:00:43,581 --> 00:00:44,753
See you again

6
00:00:57,799 --> 00:00:59,019
[06:13]

7
00:01:22,003 --> 00:01:24,227
Yes, this is Naeri Gas Station

8
00:01:29,211 --> 00:01:30,810
You need petrol delivered?

9
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,027
Ah, yes, that's possible

10
00:01:36,893 --> 00:01:38,553
Could you please tell me the address?

11
00:01:42,586 --> 00:01:43,622
Ah...

12
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:47,091
Piano...

13
00:01:48,226 --> 00:01:49,399
Excuse me

14
00:01:50,338 --> 00:01:51,769
Naeri Gas Station
Could you please not make prank calls?

15
00:02:02,511 --> 00:02:03,823
Then why are you asking for

16
00:02:03,824 --> 00:02:05,459
water instead of petrol?

17
00:02:06,263 --> 00:02:07,530
And it's weird to get a delivery call

18
00:02:07,531 --> 00:02:09,082
from that house around 6 PM tomorrow

19
00:02:10,306 --> 00:02:11,856
Isn't this some kind of strange thing?

20
00:02:13,821 --> 00:02:14,883
Besides

21
00:02:15,471 --> 00:02:16,637
I don't see any reason

22
00:02:16,638 --> 00:02:17,861
to follow your request

23
00:02:21,979 --> 00:02:24,404
Looks like we've got no choice but
to be discharged from the hospital

24
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:27,147
What about Dad's surgery?

25
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:36,530
First, get a place to stay

26
00:02:37,276 --> 00:02:39,860
We can do the surgery...

27
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,486
once we've saved up some money

28
00:03:01,609 --> 00:03:02,841
I confirmed the money deposited

29
00:03:03,426 --> 00:03:04,532
But

30
00:03:06,714 --> 00:03:08,203
this isn't some dangerous job, right?

31
00:03:12,314 --> 00:03:13,443
Piano Academy
Alright

32
00:03:15,058 --> 00:03:16,287
I left it near the house

33
00:03:19,618 --> 00:03:20,921
I'm done now

34
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,262
I can't do it anymore

35
00:03:26,045 --> 00:03:27,185
Yes

36
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,655
If you deliver it to the house, I'll
deposit the same amount as I just sent

37
00:03:47,283 --> 00:03:48,430
But

38
00:03:49,018 --> 00:03:50,041
why don't you do it yourself

39
00:03:50,042 --> 00:03:51,639
and pay someone else to do it?

40
00:03:57,564 --> 00:03:58,710
Who are you?

41
00:04:36,781 --> 00:04:37,953
You are

42
00:04:39,538 --> 00:04:40,886
the one who sent the money to me, right?

43
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:58,925
Suicide / Arson / Legacy

44
00:04:58,926 --> 00:04:59,937
The Hidden Contractor

45
00:04:59,938 --> 00:05:01,114
Contract / Arson

46
00:05:01,281 --> 00:05:02,545
The Most Precious Thing

47
00:05:02,546 --> 00:05:03,667
The Boy of Fate

48
00:05:03,978 --> 00:05:05,165
Remarriage

49
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:46,507
Dorena Songjoo Apartment Construction Site

50
00:05:46,508 --> 00:05:47,683
How far have you come?

51
00:05:48,219 --> 00:05:49,796
- Have you entered Songjoo?
- Yes

52
00:05:49,797 --> 00:05:51,001
I just entered

53
00:05:51,281 --> 00:05:53,127
How is it? Changed a lot, right?

54
00:05:53,528 --> 00:05:55,268
Man, it was chaos even
after you went to the US

55
00:05:55,796 --> 00:05:57,732
People were dead set
against redevelopment, but

56
00:05:57,733 --> 00:05:59,405
once it was decided and underway

57
00:05:59,406 --> 00:06:00,603
property prices went up

58
00:06:00,604 --> 00:06:02,101
Jobs came to this
rotten neighborhood

59
00:06:02,859 --> 00:06:03,956
then the legislator's
approval ratings

60
00:06:03,957 --> 00:06:04,979
shoot up

61
00:06:05,972 --> 00:06:07,507
In the end, no matter what

62
00:06:07,508 --> 00:06:08,604
what matters most is

63
00:06:08,605 --> 00:06:09,693
food on their table

64
00:06:11,056 --> 00:06:12,255
Hello? Are you listening?

65
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,572
Yes, I'm listening

66
00:06:14,756 --> 00:06:15,800
You're really boring

67
00:06:16,549 --> 00:06:17,623
Why didn't you learn

68
00:06:17,624 --> 00:06:18,704
some American jokes?

69
00:06:26,244 --> 00:06:27,280
Welcome

70
00:06:29,026 --> 00:06:30,249
How much shall I fill up?

71
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,875
- Full tank, please
- Yes, full tank

72
00:06:31,876 --> 00:06:33,080
- Please turn off the engine
- But you know what the legislator

73
00:06:33,081 --> 00:06:34,257
loves more than

74
00:06:34,258 --> 00:06:35,639
his rising approval rating?

75
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,643
What is it?

76
00:06:36,644 --> 00:06:38,739
That you changed your mind
and came back to Korea

77
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,754
Let's talk more when we meet

78
00:06:42,051 --> 00:06:43,309
- You're coming straight home, right?
- Sir

79
00:06:43,873 --> 00:06:45,059
Could you please turn off the engine?

80
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:50,795
Sir?

81
00:06:57,473 --> 00:06:58,529
Sir

82
00:06:58,530 --> 00:06:59,817
Please turn off the engine...

83
00:07:33,634 --> 00:07:35,560
Did you know about it?

84
00:07:36,607 --> 00:07:38,395
- I'm sorry
- Stop it

85
00:09:25,713 --> 00:09:27,049
Ladies and gentlemen!

86
00:09:27,527 --> 00:09:30,172
Dear citizens of Songjoo

87
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:32,977
Do you know who's here with us?

88
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,232
The grandson of our Songjoo city

89
00:09:35,481 --> 00:09:37,835
has returned!

90
00:09:43,378 --> 00:09:47,251
Let's hear a word from

91
00:09:47,658 --> 00:09:49,136
Songjoo's grandson

92
00:09:49,137 --> 00:09:50,497
about his aspirations!

93
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,712
Instead of a boring speech

94
00:10:01,105 --> 00:10:02,484
Instead of a boring speech

95
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:04,147
how about I pour

96
00:10:04,148 --> 00:10:05,417
everyone a drink?

97
00:10:06,496 --> 00:10:07,824
Ah, that's great!

98
00:10:08,933 --> 00:10:10,271
The grandson of Songjoo!

99
00:10:10,272 --> 00:10:12,638
I'll take the first drink

100
00:10:13,845 --> 00:10:15,827
- Thank you for the help
- Oh, no need to be so formal

101
00:10:15,828 --> 00:10:17,021
Oh, dear

102
00:10:23,818 --> 00:10:25,298
- Have a drink
- Yes

103
00:10:26,649 --> 00:10:28,628
He has really grown up well

104
00:10:45,701 --> 00:10:46,719
Junho

105
00:10:46,999 --> 00:10:48,123
You're here?

106
00:10:50,026 --> 00:10:51,291
It's boring to sit inside

107
00:10:51,703 --> 00:10:53,287
when I can't even drink

108
00:10:57,001 --> 00:10:58,026
Why?

109
00:10:58,769 --> 00:11:00,145
You're the main guest today

110
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:03,209
What are you talking about?

111
00:11:04,741 --> 00:11:06,528
Except for Dad, we're all just extras

112
00:11:07,981 --> 00:11:09,112
Right

113
00:11:10,206 --> 00:11:11,293
the legislator

114
00:11:12,021 --> 00:11:13,579
did go a bit too far

115
00:11:16,604 --> 00:11:18,106
How hard have I worked all this time?

116
00:11:20,109 --> 00:11:21,755
On a day like today, he could've at least

117
00:11:21,756 --> 00:11:23,012
filled my glass and said well done

118
00:11:24,337 --> 00:11:25,397
introduced me

119
00:11:25,398 --> 00:11:26,910
in front of everyone

120
00:11:27,499 --> 00:11:29,020
as his aide

121
00:11:29,914 --> 00:11:31,031
That would have been nice

122
00:11:32,524 --> 00:11:33,912
I can't even share the table with him

123
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:38,694
You shouldn't do that, okay?

124
00:11:42,347 --> 00:11:43,477
Just kidding

125
00:11:43,478 --> 00:11:44,752
You wouldn't do that

126
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:51,019
I haven't forgotten

127
00:11:52,811 --> 00:11:54,345
that you took care of me

128
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:56,182
Did I only care about you?

129
00:11:56,451 --> 00:11:57,748
I cared about your friend too

130
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:00,025
Remember that kid from the container?

131
00:12:00,652 --> 00:12:01,866
He nearly got into big trouble

132
00:12:02,063 --> 00:12:03,139
Remember?

133
00:12:07,517 --> 00:12:08,580
Hwan

134
00:12:10,944 --> 00:12:12,499
You're all I have now

135
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:17,141
You're my insurance and my lottery

136
00:12:20,876 --> 00:12:22,014
When you said you'd follow

137
00:12:22,015 --> 00:12:23,551
the legislator into politics

138
00:12:25,464 --> 00:12:27,579
all these grievances in my heart

139
00:12:27,766 --> 00:12:29,579
flashed before my eyes

140
00:12:32,713 --> 00:12:34,040
What am I saying to you?

141
00:12:35,693 --> 00:12:38,025
Make sure you succeed, alright?

142
00:12:40,254 --> 00:12:41,996
Yes, of course

143
00:12:53,086 --> 00:12:54,852
About what I said today

144
00:12:55,042 --> 00:12:56,380
- Please take care of it
- Sure

145
00:12:56,381 --> 00:12:57,498
I will take care of it

146
00:12:58,936 --> 00:13:00,046
Let's go, Hwan

147
00:13:00,765 --> 00:13:02,043
I'll walk to sober up

148
00:13:02,301 --> 00:13:04,531
- You go ahead
- Okay, keep in touch

149
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:49,450
Welcome

150
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:55,981
Can I help you?

151
00:14:08,786 --> 00:14:09,868
Hwan

152
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,279
Long time no see

153
00:14:15,968 --> 00:14:17,021
Yeah

154
00:14:18,655 --> 00:14:19,899
it's been a while

155
00:14:36,348 --> 00:14:37,837
Wait a moment

156
00:14:46,901 --> 00:14:48,449
It's all set, come in

157
00:14:53,536 --> 00:14:54,598
Sit here

158
00:14:58,629 --> 00:14:59,684
Do you want some coffee?

159
00:14:59,967 --> 00:15:01,263
Ah, thanks

160
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:10,621
Ah, so that car earlier was yours

161
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:12,232
I wondered

162
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:18,600
Sorry about earlier,
I was just so floundering

163
00:15:24,127 --> 00:15:25,947
I thought of you when I saw this place

164
00:15:26,563 --> 00:15:28,007
but didn't expect you to be here

165
00:15:29,816 --> 00:15:31,639
I thought you had moved away

166
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:33,605
I'm just living like this

167
00:15:41,137 --> 00:15:42,387
Nothing much has changed

168
00:15:42,757 --> 00:15:44,075
from living in a container, right?

169
00:15:45,054 --> 00:15:47,470
Ah, unintentionally
following the latest trend

170
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,590
minimalism, huh?

171
00:15:58,510 --> 00:15:59,701
When did you come back?

172
00:16:00,183 --> 00:16:01,294
Not long ago

173
00:16:02,185 --> 00:16:03,343
Maybe a month or two?

174
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:05,517
What about you, bro?

175
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,112
When did you come back?

176
00:16:08,499 --> 00:16:09,593
Ah...

177
00:16:11,226 --> 00:16:13,086
I've been in Korea for a while

178
00:16:14,468 --> 00:16:15,932
but today's my first day in Songjoo

179
00:16:20,169 --> 00:16:21,521
So you were in Korea

180
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,287
How are the guys?

181
00:16:31,636 --> 00:16:32,761
I left

182
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,989
without saying much back then

183
00:16:36,191 --> 00:16:37,312
I don't know

184
00:16:39,382 --> 00:16:40,565
After you went to the US

185
00:16:41,275 --> 00:16:42,506
and I moved

186
00:16:43,671 --> 00:16:44,696
then

187
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,893
I didn't keep in touch with them

188
00:16:49,366 --> 00:16:50,436
No, actually

189
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,509
I couldn't

190
00:16:52,844 --> 00:16:53,920
Just to survive

191
00:17:02,296 --> 00:17:03,545
But

192
00:17:04,646 --> 00:17:06,134
I did get in touch with Hosu

193
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,888
but that was only until

194
00:17:08,888 --> 00:17:09,969
Dohyeon was transferred

195
00:17:09,971 --> 00:17:11,423
to another facility

196
00:17:12,847 --> 00:17:15,066
Where did Hosu go?

197
00:17:17,026 --> 00:17:18,214
The orphanage was demolished

198
00:17:18,507 --> 00:17:20,122
for redevelopment

199
00:17:22,714 --> 00:17:24,541
It felt too awkward to ask

200
00:17:27,411 --> 00:17:28,551
how each other was doing

201
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:32,837
At that time,

202
00:17:33,804 --> 00:17:35,623
honestly, it was a mess
for everyone, wasn't it?

203
00:17:38,088 --> 00:17:39,197
Well

204
00:17:40,151 --> 00:17:41,662
You never know, everyone
might be doing okay

205
00:17:42,303 --> 00:17:43,394
and living well

206
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,908
so maybe there's no need to contact

207
00:17:48,446 --> 00:17:49,583
And

208
00:17:51,659 --> 00:17:53,124
I hope everyone's doing fine

209
00:18:09,385 --> 00:18:10,730
Why don't you call them?

210
00:18:11,483 --> 00:18:12,551
Their numbers

211
00:18:13,078 --> 00:18:14,733
might still be the same

212
00:18:15,868 --> 00:18:17,355
They'd probably be happy to hear from you

213
00:18:18,283 --> 00:18:19,420
At least

214
00:18:20,321 --> 00:18:22,155
you won't be talking
about your own hardships

215
00:18:29,269 --> 00:18:31,042
- Nice shot
- Good shot

216
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:32,065
Good shot

217
00:18:34,744 --> 00:18:35,766
Mr. Seo

218
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,931
maybe you should tell your sons

219
00:18:37,932 --> 00:18:39,199
to go easy

220
00:18:39,678 --> 00:18:41,206
That's a bit difficult

221
00:18:42,118 --> 00:18:44,164
They're already trying to play gently

222
00:18:45,938 --> 00:18:47,211
- Shall we go?
- Yes

223
00:18:50,845 --> 00:18:52,002
I heard that

224
00:18:52,826 --> 00:18:54,307
it was your son who crushed

225
00:18:54,308 --> 00:18:55,366
the dreams of Chairman Kim's second son

226
00:18:55,859 --> 00:18:57,529
who was aiming to go pro

227
00:18:58,543 --> 00:19:00,164
Jeha is still young

228
00:19:00,936 --> 00:19:02,252
but he's surprisingly strong

229
00:19:06,474 --> 00:19:07,547
You're pretty skilled

230
00:19:09,421 --> 00:19:11,411
I'm glad that
you look like you're doing well

231
00:19:13,106 --> 00:19:14,216
Does it seem that way?

232
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:17,968
No?

233
00:19:19,388 --> 00:19:20,422
You too

234
00:19:21,543 --> 00:19:23,068
I'm glad that you are doing well, too

235
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:25,760
Stepdad mentioned

236
00:19:26,087 --> 00:19:27,122
you came back

237
00:19:27,123 --> 00:19:28,276
to get into politics

238
00:19:30,673 --> 00:19:31,956
Suits you, kinda like

239
00:19:34,122 --> 00:19:35,340
What you said before

240
00:19:35,749 --> 00:19:36,749
I

241
00:19:38,056 --> 00:19:39,334
try to become like Dad

242
00:19:41,396 --> 00:19:42,664
Hadn't you already become like him?

243
00:19:44,998 --> 00:19:46,055
Dressed like this

244
00:19:46,848 --> 00:19:48,501
you're exactly like your Dad

245
00:19:51,051 --> 00:19:52,100
Because I'm his son

246
00:19:54,796 --> 00:19:56,551
You really do seem like family now

247
00:19:59,134 --> 00:20:00,899
Trying doesn't always make it happen

248
00:20:02,287 --> 00:20:03,319
Especially for family

249
00:20:13,661 --> 00:20:15,144
I met Dogeon yesterday

250
00:20:18,126 --> 00:20:19,263
Did you stop by the gas station?

251
00:20:20,498 --> 00:20:22,599
You knew? That Dogeon came back?

252
00:20:24,662 --> 00:20:25,738
Saw him on the way

253
00:20:26,212 --> 00:20:27,498
But he probably doesn't know

254
00:20:27,706 --> 00:20:28,752
that I saw him

255
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:31,260
You saw him, but why didn't you say hi?

256
00:20:31,959 --> 00:20:33,789
Dogeon is curious about you guys too

257
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:40,537
Do you keep in touch with the others?

258
00:20:43,674 --> 00:20:44,904
How could I contact them?

259
00:20:46,262 --> 00:20:47,357
They don't like me

260
00:20:48,754 --> 00:20:50,761
Who doesn't like you? Us?

261
00:20:52,849 --> 00:20:54,443
After Cein transferred like that

262
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,108
and we all were split up

263
00:20:59,414 --> 00:21:00,478
It's because of me

264
00:21:01,586 --> 00:21:02,608
Jeha

265
00:21:04,307 --> 00:21:06,362
Why's that your fault? It's not

266
00:21:07,172 --> 00:21:08,186
It's just

267
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:13,791
Everyone was having a hard time

268
00:21:14,328 --> 00:21:15,391
I was too

269
00:21:16,031 --> 00:21:17,079
What about now?

270
00:21:19,438 --> 00:21:20,632
Is it easy now?

271
00:21:23,445 --> 00:21:24,447
When does it all

272
00:21:24,448 --> 00:21:25,600
stop being hard?

273
00:21:28,084 --> 00:21:29,120
If it stops being hard

274
00:21:30,634 --> 00:21:31,868
can we all meet?

275
00:21:36,521 --> 00:21:37,594
If you contact

276
00:21:37,595 --> 00:21:38,654
and we all get together

277
00:21:39,301 --> 00:21:40,450
let me join, okay?

278
00:21:41,816 --> 00:21:43,201
It's been so long since we all met

279
00:21:47,352 --> 00:21:48,551
Except Cein

280
00:21:57,948 --> 00:21:59,347
It was only me that I saw him

281
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,789
I sometimes went to Cein's new place

282
00:22:02,894 --> 00:22:04,562
waited outside, and then sneaked a peek

283
00:22:04,563 --> 00:22:05,785
without anyone knowing

284
00:22:07,575 --> 00:22:09,065
Cein would hate it

285
00:22:09,595 --> 00:22:10,808
Like that time with the location tracker

286
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:47,912
Why didn't you call?

287
00:23:48,157 --> 00:23:49,325
You didn't even know when I'll be home

288
00:23:52,976 --> 00:23:54,122
Thought you might not answer

289
00:23:57,033 --> 00:23:58,074
If you don't

290
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,325
I might not have the courage again

291
00:24:13,915 --> 00:24:15,168
Is that why everyone

292
00:24:15,169 --> 00:24:16,351
doesn't call?

293
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:20,851
Why aren't you eating?

294
00:24:20,852 --> 00:24:22,147
I ordered it for you

295
00:24:25,372 --> 00:24:26,377
I...

296
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:28,682
can't eat silkworm pupa

297
00:24:30,868 --> 00:24:31,885
Did you not

298
00:24:33,208 --> 00:24:34,513
eat silkworm pupa?

299
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:37,744
Then who likes them?

300
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:40,978
How about this one?

301
00:24:41,841 --> 00:24:43,286
You like this...

302
00:24:44,654 --> 00:24:45,784
right?

303
00:24:47,098 --> 00:24:48,177
No?

304
00:24:52,269 --> 00:24:53,283
Oh, sorry

305
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:57,956
I know I'm sloppy, but you...

306
00:24:58,744 --> 00:25:00,359
If you are going to
act clumsy with that face,

307
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,501
just give it to me

308
00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:06,835
But you're quite late

309
00:25:07,407 --> 00:25:08,626
Where have you been till now?

310
00:25:10,311 --> 00:25:11,406
Night work

311
00:25:13,994 --> 00:25:15,068
Oh

312
00:25:16,198 --> 00:25:17,864
You work at nights

313
00:25:18,762 --> 00:25:20,320
Not that kind of night work

314
00:25:20,321 --> 00:25:22,577
I work part-time at a
funeral home at night

315
00:25:22,947 --> 00:25:24,561
Oh, I thought...

316
00:25:26,545 --> 00:25:27,960
I heard that's a hard job

317
00:25:27,961 --> 00:25:29,334
switching day and night

318
00:25:31,744 --> 00:25:32,753
But

319
00:25:39,227 --> 00:25:40,278
I like it

320
00:25:42,211 --> 00:25:43,762
At the funeral home

321
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:47,295
no one complains if I don't smile

322
00:25:50,917 --> 00:25:51,976
But why did you

323
00:25:53,138 --> 00:25:54,309
come back?

324
00:25:54,737 --> 00:25:56,708
I heard you went to the US

325
00:25:59,665 --> 00:26:00,686
Maybe

326
00:26:01,057 --> 00:26:02,143
you came to see me?

327
00:26:02,829 --> 00:26:04,994
Probably not

328
00:26:09,152 --> 00:26:10,202
I just

329
00:26:14,013 --> 00:26:15,053
really wanted to

330
00:26:19,748 --> 00:26:22,308
apologize properly

331
00:26:25,928 --> 00:26:26,978
You

332
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:29,103
were genuinely

333
00:26:29,639 --> 00:26:30,760
worried about me

334
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:34,083
- I...
- That's enough

335
00:26:35,296 --> 00:26:36,466
Let's just drink

336
00:26:39,115 --> 00:26:40,487
And how would you know

337
00:26:40,488 --> 00:26:42,269
if I was sincere back then?

338
00:26:53,439 --> 00:26:55,015
I'm sorry

339
00:26:55,479 --> 00:26:56,591
I

340
00:26:57,548 --> 00:26:59,308
really am

341
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:00,697
sorry to you

342
00:27:02,907 --> 00:27:05,493
I'm so sorry that

343
00:27:05,494 --> 00:27:07,420
I can say nothing but sorry

344
00:27:08,198 --> 00:27:09,294
I

345
00:27:10,343 --> 00:27:13,094
- really wanted to say this
- Damn it

346
00:27:13,976 --> 00:27:15,643
Enough with the apologies

347
00:27:18,434 --> 00:27:19,448
Hwan

348
00:27:21,647 --> 00:27:22,696
Hwan!

349
00:27:25,157 --> 00:27:26,557
We were young at that time

350
00:27:28,662 --> 00:27:31,013
We were nineteen, maybe twenty

351
00:27:33,405 --> 00:27:35,712
But now I'm twenty one

352
00:27:40,285 --> 00:27:42,910
Look at this, a receipt

353
00:27:45,067 --> 00:27:46,179
a lighter

354
00:27:46,769 --> 00:27:47,806
dust

355
00:27:48,339 --> 00:27:49,414
all these kinds of crap

356
00:27:50,773 --> 00:27:53,049
Back then, we had even less

357
00:27:57,904 --> 00:27:59,004
and, bro

358
00:28:01,139 --> 00:28:02,634
back then, among us

359
00:28:02,635 --> 00:28:04,482
you looked the most anxious

360
00:28:06,335 --> 00:28:08,243
When you're anxious,
you can see nothing but you

361
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,267
Your vision narrows

362
00:28:11,527 --> 00:28:12,693
like a racehorse

363
00:28:15,942 --> 00:28:18,076
To escape anxiety,

364
00:28:18,877 --> 00:28:21,607
if you flounder for a way out

365
00:28:25,266 --> 00:28:27,246
you can't see anything around you

366
00:28:31,013 --> 00:28:32,085
That's how it was

367
00:29:07,318 --> 00:29:08,510
My dad

368
00:29:09,259 --> 00:29:10,379
it's been a while

369
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,212
since he could sleep without his meds

370
00:29:13,308 --> 00:29:14,309
I

371
00:29:16,587 --> 00:29:18,078
really didn't know

372
00:29:22,454 --> 00:29:23,955
Not that I didn't know

373
00:29:25,969 --> 00:29:27,368
I chose not to see

374
00:29:29,317 --> 00:29:30,883
I was always focused on

375
00:29:30,884 --> 00:29:32,320
my absent mom

376
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:48,056
You know what?

377
00:29:49,175 --> 00:29:52,184
While I saw my mom who's
already dead and gone

378
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:56,679
I didn't see my dad

379
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,269
alive and worrying about me

380
00:29:59,229 --> 00:30:00,232
Do you have evidence?

381
00:30:00,658 --> 00:30:01,676
Is there a witness?

382
00:30:01,677 --> 00:30:02,779
He is a minor!

383
00:30:03,465 --> 00:30:04,478
Cein Min

384
00:30:04,815 --> 00:30:05,829
Get up

385
00:30:06,317 --> 00:30:07,317
What are you doing?

386
00:30:07,641 --> 00:30:08,708
You don't need to be like this

387
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:10,579
Get up

388
00:30:11,026 --> 00:30:12,307
Even if you say it's okay

389
00:30:14,873 --> 00:30:16,277
seeing my son go through this

390
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:21,007
as a father, it makes me angry

391
00:30:22,215 --> 00:30:24,513
Now that I see my father,
who was never around before

392
00:30:26,738 --> 00:30:28,524
I think about how he managed

393
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:30,449
all this time

394
00:30:32,031 --> 00:30:34,086
how he lived

395
00:30:36,981 --> 00:30:38,872
It's not just because he's my father

396
00:30:40,057 --> 00:30:41,492
but that person

397
00:30:42,985 --> 00:30:45,946
That person, Youngho Min...

398
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:52,994
his back

399
00:30:56,043 --> 00:30:57,117
it's just too...

400
00:31:14,417 --> 00:31:16,564
So I decided to live

401
00:31:18,479 --> 00:31:20,767
To live, at least for my father's sake

402
00:31:24,011 --> 00:31:26,241
And I just get through each day

403
00:31:32,012 --> 00:31:34,344
Not living, but getting through

404
00:31:38,410 --> 00:31:39,578
like this drink

405
00:31:49,461 --> 00:31:51,709
Yeah, whatever

406
00:31:53,364 --> 00:31:54,670
just have to live

407
00:31:55,808 --> 00:31:57,089
As long as you're alive

408
00:31:58,767 --> 00:32:00,169
you can meet anyone

409
00:32:01,654 --> 00:32:02,737
Like...

410
00:32:03,625 --> 00:32:04,797
I met Dogeon yesterday

411
00:32:05,329 --> 00:32:07,541
and Jeha today

412
00:32:15,474 --> 00:32:16,566
Is Jeha

413
00:32:21,228 --> 00:32:22,566
doing well?

414
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,269
Call him

415
00:32:34,136 --> 00:32:35,295
You know

416
00:32:35,296 --> 00:32:37,667
Jeha is waiting for you

417
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,004
No

418
00:32:42,723 --> 00:32:44,422
What can't be done, can't be done

419
00:32:48,372 --> 00:32:49,581
You don't want to see him?

420
00:32:50,297 --> 00:32:51,454
Just because you want to see someone

421
00:32:51,455 --> 00:32:53,709
doesn't mean you can see anyone anytime

422
00:32:55,377 --> 00:32:56,924
I know that

423
00:32:57,682 --> 00:32:58,693
No

424
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,654
I'm going to see

425
00:33:04,582 --> 00:33:08,107
I'm going to see everyone

426
00:33:08,605 --> 00:33:10,168
So you

427
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:12,909
follow me or not, it's up to you

428
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,509
This is my call, so

429
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:17,300
you can't stop me

430
00:33:17,994 --> 00:33:19,397
Huh? What?

431
00:33:20,147 --> 00:33:22,217
- Jooan is...
- You're really calling?

432
00:33:23,213 --> 00:33:25,209
Wow, this guy is really drunk

433
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:27,354
- Don't do it
- Why not?

434
00:33:27,621 --> 00:33:28,832
Why can't I?

435
00:33:29,711 --> 00:33:31,261
If you don't see who you miss now

436
00:33:31,262 --> 00:33:32,291
When will you?

437
00:33:32,292 --> 00:33:33,367
This guy

438
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:34,813
after going to the States

439
00:33:35,457 --> 00:33:37,168
became so open minded

440
00:33:37,169 --> 00:33:38,754
Yeah, I'm open minded

441
00:34:02,701 --> 00:34:03,789
Yeah, right

442
00:34:05,691 --> 00:34:07,724
Better not to have done it at all

443
00:34:09,105 --> 00:34:11,118
than to have done it and be refused

444
00:34:12,042 --> 00:34:13,100
Ugh...

445
00:34:13,844 --> 00:34:15,635
That's just too cruel

446
00:34:37,192 --> 00:34:40,367
Obituary message for Cein Min

447
00:34:40,368 --> 00:34:42,078
Chamjoheun Funeral Home

448
00:34:43,469 --> 00:34:44,511
Cein

449
00:34:47,288 --> 00:34:48,523
What is this?

450
00:34:48,524 --> 00:34:53,185
Chamjoheun Funeral Home

451
00:34:58,377 --> 00:34:59,663
Even so

452
00:35:00,572 --> 00:35:01,672
A death notice text...

453
00:35:03,862 --> 00:35:04,893
Hey

454
00:35:05,472 --> 00:35:07,060
It's the surest thing, right?

455
00:35:09,388 --> 00:35:10,959
Not coming even after hearing my death?

456
00:35:13,777 --> 00:35:15,754
Then it can't be helped

457
00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:20,766
Let's go

458
00:35:22,132 --> 00:35:23,158
Hey, that's

459
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:25,881
just nonsense

460
00:35:25,882 --> 00:35:26,944
I don't know

461
00:35:53,124 --> 00:35:54,146
Hwan

462
00:35:55,457 --> 00:35:56,480
Sit down

463
00:36:02,132 --> 00:36:04,345
I guess they noticed it was a joke

464
00:36:05,358 --> 00:36:07,159
I knew it was kind of out of the blue

465
00:36:07,374 --> 00:36:08,689
Who jokes about their own death?

466
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:10,281
Seriously, who does that?

467
00:36:12,523 --> 00:36:13,595
Well...

468
00:36:14,515 --> 00:36:16,333
It's really late now

469
00:36:16,663 --> 00:36:17,776
It's 4:30 AM

470
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,191
He is Hosu...

471
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,654
But where is he going...

472
00:36:30,595 --> 00:36:31,623
Hosu

473
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:32,786
Hosu!

474
00:36:36,765 --> 00:36:37,799
By the way

475
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,537
Why this bro all of a sudden...

476
00:36:40,588 --> 00:36:41,612
Bro?

477
00:36:42,218 --> 00:36:43,609
What's your relationship with him?

478
00:36:49,228 --> 00:36:51,261
He was a really
close friend like a brother

479
00:36:53,267 --> 00:36:55,005
I went to the same middle and high school

480
00:36:55,006 --> 00:36:56,530
With my father?

481
00:36:57,236 --> 00:36:58,239
What?

482
00:37:00,362 --> 00:37:02,198
- Your father?
- Yes

483
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:14,656
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry
- What?

484
00:37:15,884 --> 00:37:17,588
- What?
- Sorry

485
00:37:18,224 --> 00:37:19,230
I'm sorry

486
00:37:27,316 --> 00:37:29,449
- Did you drink?
- No

487
00:37:31,744 --> 00:37:32,752
Yes

488
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:34,074
A little

489
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,294
A little too much

490
00:37:35,674 --> 00:37:36,703
Funny?

491
00:37:37,238 --> 00:37:38,469
Watch your language...

492
00:37:43,925 --> 00:37:44,930
Sorry

493
00:37:46,708 --> 00:37:47,812
It was my idea

494
00:37:47,813 --> 00:37:48,954
Hwan is not to blame

495
00:37:49,113 --> 00:37:50,118
That's right

496
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:51,157
What the...

497
00:37:51,546 --> 00:37:52,600
Sorry, no

498
00:37:53,353 --> 00:37:55,263
I should have stopped even if I was drunk

499
00:37:55,264 --> 00:37:56,690
My fault, sorry

500
00:38:07,955 --> 00:38:09,260
I thought I'd never see you again

501
00:38:09,261 --> 00:38:10,857
I was so worried

502
00:38:12,526 --> 00:38:14,288
Ah, you elder, come on!

503
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:22,393
I'll text the guys it was a joke

504
00:38:25,882 --> 00:38:27,320
It's unfair

505
00:38:27,321 --> 00:38:28,815
if I'm the only one tricked

506
00:38:30,954 --> 00:38:31,975
Guys

507
00:38:35,069 --> 00:38:37,183
Ah, seriously! Ah, really!

508
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,086
Ah, that crazy guy, seriously

509
00:38:39,333 --> 00:38:40,447
Are you out of your mind?

510
00:38:40,448 --> 00:38:41,907
Sorry, really sorry

511
00:38:43,393 --> 00:38:44,457
Let go

512
00:38:44,458 --> 00:38:46,839
- Let go! Won't you let go?
- Calm down, please

513
00:38:47,098 --> 00:38:48,255
Is this a thing for humans to do?

514
00:38:48,256 --> 00:38:50,001
- You're crazy, really
- Sorry, we

515
00:38:50,585 --> 00:38:51,610
drank too much

516
00:38:51,611 --> 00:38:52,630
and were out of our mind

517
00:38:53,218 --> 00:38:54,241
Hey, Jooan Kim

518
00:38:54,242 --> 00:38:55,251
Your dirty words are

519
00:38:55,252 --> 00:38:56,627
pro level, huh?

520
00:38:56,901 --> 00:38:58,069
How much do you earn for that?

521
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:03,107
- How much, huh? How much?
- What's wrong with you

522
00:39:05,021 --> 00:39:07,135
I'm really scared of Jooan

523
00:39:07,582 --> 00:39:08,990
So at least pretend to stop

524
00:39:08,991 --> 00:39:10,117
please, huh?

525
00:39:18,844 --> 00:39:20,506
Waah, Cein...

526
00:39:35,246 --> 00:39:36,301
That's enough

527
00:39:36,462 --> 00:39:37,679
Baby Jeon

528
00:39:44,466 --> 00:39:45,507
I thought

529
00:39:45,845 --> 00:39:47,843
I really thought you died

530
00:39:49,403 --> 00:39:50,547
Sorry

531
00:39:50,658 --> 00:39:51,711
for not dead

532
00:39:55,451 --> 00:39:57,463
Ah, this is freaking awkward

533
00:39:58,717 --> 00:39:59,729
I know you like it

534
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:02,165
What are you saying

535
00:40:03,562 --> 00:40:04,582
Right

536
00:40:04,812 --> 00:40:06,303
Honestly, it was too much

537
00:40:07,568 --> 00:40:08,934
But if you didn't do it

538
00:40:09,785 --> 00:40:11,498
it would be impossible to meet everyone

539
00:40:13,116 --> 00:40:14,156
It's not everyone

540
00:40:16,316 --> 00:40:18,363
Is Haru still in the hospital?

541
00:40:22,566 --> 00:40:23,652
Then

542
00:40:24,485 --> 00:40:26,289
Can't we go see him?

543
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:49,105
Haru

544
00:41:01,841 --> 00:41:03,832
I'm not fully awake yet, right?

545
00:41:23,656 --> 00:41:26,712
Ah, so that's why your eyes look like that

546
00:41:27,043 --> 00:41:28,893
Oh, my poor baby, were you sad?

547
00:41:30,535 --> 00:41:31,967
You have no idea how shocked I was

548
00:41:32,476 --> 00:41:34,040
Cein went too far

549
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:37,532
He had always been a bit odd, remember?

550
00:41:39,479 --> 00:41:40,619
Was there ever

551
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:41,623
a normal one among us?

552
00:41:43,059 --> 00:41:44,883
Our hardships

553
00:41:45,006 --> 00:41:46,582
were coming from the reason
we couldn't be normal, right?

554
00:41:48,009 --> 00:41:49,145
Anyway

555
00:41:49,626 --> 00:41:51,356
Seeing everyone like this

556
00:41:53,157 --> 00:41:54,356
I'm so happy

557
00:41:54,641 --> 00:41:55,700
Hey

558
00:41:56,443 --> 00:41:58,517
Do you live here? Not discharged yet?

559
00:41:59,351 --> 00:42:00,962
I'll come get you when you're discharged

560
00:42:01,292 --> 00:42:02,368
Call me

561
00:42:02,369 --> 00:42:03,436
Really?

562
00:42:05,687 --> 00:42:06,766
Are you sure?

563
00:42:07,335 --> 00:42:08,620
Everyone is coming that day?

564
00:42:08,621 --> 00:42:09,661
When all of you are here

565
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:11,317
The beach

566
00:42:11,455 --> 00:42:12,532
Remember how fun it was

567
00:42:12,533 --> 00:42:13,673
when we went to the beach?

568
00:42:14,171 --> 00:42:15,306
Playing in the water

569
00:42:15,307 --> 00:42:16,636
Campfire

570
00:42:16,637 --> 00:42:17,780
Even saw a dead body

571
00:42:18,073 --> 00:42:19,270
Went to the police station

572
00:42:25,131 --> 00:42:26,196
Yes

573
00:42:26,626 --> 00:42:27,633
Let's go

574
00:42:28,175 --> 00:42:29,306
let's go for sure, Haru

575
00:42:30,042 --> 00:42:31,051
Ugh

576
00:42:31,738 --> 00:42:34,002
'someday', 'soon', 'eventually'

577
00:42:34,213 --> 00:42:35,656
Hate those promises

578
00:42:35,657 --> 00:42:36,758
Don't believe them

579
00:42:37,373 --> 00:42:38,526
If we're going, let's just go today

580
00:42:39,488 --> 00:42:41,393
- Today?
- Right now

581
00:42:44,589 --> 00:42:45,666
Is it possible to

582
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:47,423
go out from here?

583
00:42:48,022 --> 00:42:49,251
Technically yes

584
00:42:50,554 --> 00:42:52,237
But I need parental consent

585
00:42:53,635 --> 00:42:54,932
Probably it won't happen

586
00:43:07,154 --> 00:43:08,166
There's a way

587
00:43:26,261 --> 00:43:27,664
- Guys
- Yes?

588
00:43:29,084 --> 00:43:30,904
- Run!
- Run, Run, Run

589
00:43:53,121 --> 00:43:55,205
I promise, I'll definitely come back!

590
00:43:56,071 --> 00:43:57,722
- Sorry!
- Wait!

591
00:43:59,306 --> 00:44:00,337
Haru!

592
00:45:27,332 --> 00:45:28,530
Okay, say cheese

593
00:45:29,276 --> 00:45:30,269
Ready

594
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:32,786
One, two, three

595
00:45:35,541 --> 00:45:37,424
What was that?

596
00:45:37,425 --> 00:45:39,273
- Missed one
- Sorry, guys

597
00:45:40,124 --> 00:45:41,202
Let's try again, again

598
00:45:41,672 --> 00:45:42,674
Again!

599
00:45:43,264 --> 00:45:45,902
One, two, three

600
00:45:46,679 --> 00:45:47,825
- Grab him
- Grab, Grab

601
00:45:47,826 --> 00:45:48,989
Why? Why?

602
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:50,153
Hey, hey!

603
00:45:50,807 --> 00:45:51,980
Goodbye

604
00:46:03,867 --> 00:46:05,210
Hey, hey, hey!

605
00:46:05,482 --> 00:46:06,446
No, don't

606
00:46:17,664 --> 00:46:18,682
Hey, did you see?

607
00:46:19,644 --> 00:46:21,183
This is who I am, huh?

608
00:46:25,634 --> 00:46:27,059
Hey, you're messing with a sick kid

609
00:46:28,638 --> 00:46:30,615
Hey, it's cold, come out, quick

610
00:46:30,727 --> 00:46:32,491
- Haru
- Wait

611
00:46:35,085 --> 00:46:36,102
Hey

612
00:46:37,059 --> 00:46:38,065
Are you okay?

613
00:46:38,519 --> 00:46:39,557
Freezing, isn't it?

614
00:46:39,558 --> 00:46:41,263
- Sorry, are you okay, bro?
- Here is a towel

615
00:46:42,536 --> 00:46:43,695
Let me see your face first

616
00:46:48,763 --> 00:46:50,559
- I'll leave this here for now, put it on
- Okay

617
00:46:53,248 --> 00:46:54,277
Oh, dear

618
00:46:54,369 --> 00:46:56,183
Put this padded jacket on

619
00:46:56,343 --> 00:46:57,858
I'll get a blanket from the front

620
00:46:57,859 --> 00:46:59,009
- Hold on
- Got it

621
00:46:59,957 --> 00:47:01,304
Haru, let's change your clothes

622
00:47:02,605 --> 00:47:04,052
If you catch a cold here

623
00:47:04,053 --> 00:47:06,010
I'll really be the ultimate trash

624
00:47:06,011 --> 00:47:07,045
Are you okay?

625
00:47:10,316 --> 00:47:11,358
Can't unbutton it?

626
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:12,397
I'll do it, I'll do it

627
00:47:16,016 --> 00:47:17,040
Slowly, slowly

628
00:47:20,028 --> 00:47:21,048
Take it off

629
00:47:21,388 --> 00:47:22,765
It's cold

630
00:47:27,331 --> 00:47:28,797
Wow, golf...

631
00:47:29,112 --> 00:47:31,158
It looks expensive just by looking at it

632
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:40,171
Let's change now

633
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:43,045
Change

634
00:47:48,037 --> 00:47:49,072
Guys!

635
00:47:49,492 --> 00:47:50,620
Come here

636
00:47:51,406 --> 00:47:52,462
The sun is setting

637
00:47:53,188 --> 00:47:54,615
Okay, coming soon

638
00:47:59,415 --> 00:48:00,519
- All dressed?
- Yeah

639
00:48:08,626 --> 00:48:10,261
The sunset looks like the sun is crying

640
00:48:11,951 --> 00:48:12,966
Why?

641
00:48:13,693 --> 00:48:14,806
Just because

642
00:48:16,608 --> 00:48:18,688
Looking at it makes me
feel like crying too

643
00:48:21,167 --> 00:48:22,280
That's because

644
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:25,266
when the sun sets,

645
00:48:26,963 --> 00:48:28,301
you get hungry

646
00:48:30,930 --> 00:48:32,712
My stomach's been crying for a while now

647
00:48:35,475 --> 00:48:36,479
Hey

648
00:48:36,614 --> 00:48:37,747
It's not just crying

649
00:48:38,008 --> 00:48:39,374
It's like wailing

650
00:48:41,617 --> 00:48:42,895
But honestly, I've been

651
00:48:43,177 --> 00:48:44,889
starving for a while

652
00:48:45,452 --> 00:48:47,283
Just kept my mouth shut
not to ruin the mood

653
00:48:49,761 --> 00:48:51,363
Shall we go eat dinner?

654
00:48:52,476 --> 00:48:53,886
Since we're at the beach

655
00:48:54,373 --> 00:48:55,396
How about sashimi?

656
00:48:59,216 --> 00:49:00,220
Why?

657
00:49:00,573 --> 00:49:01,585
You don't like sashimi?

658
00:49:03,779 --> 00:49:05,788
Ah, what did I say?

659
00:49:06,094 --> 00:49:07,118
Uh?

660
00:49:07,301 --> 00:49:08,968
I knew it the first time I saw that guy

661
00:49:09,539 --> 00:49:11,101
He is someone we should cherish forever

662
00:49:11,102 --> 00:49:12,466
Didn't I say that? Huh?

663
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:14,149
No

664
00:49:14,718 --> 00:49:15,821
You said he looked sneaky

665
00:49:15,822 --> 00:49:16,832
and annoying

666
00:49:18,384 --> 00:49:19,601
I was surprised

667
00:49:21,165 --> 00:49:22,309
Let's go eat then

668
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:25,267
Where's Jooan?

669
00:49:25,777 --> 00:49:26,829
Where did he go?

670
00:49:29,408 --> 00:49:30,433
Where is him?

671
00:49:30,434 --> 00:49:31,829
He was just here a minute ago

672
00:49:32,618 --> 00:49:33,618
Jooan!

673
00:50:06,781 --> 00:50:07,812
It just felt like

674
00:50:09,581 --> 00:50:10,963
Something I saw in a dream

675
00:50:12,655 --> 00:50:14,339
Me being up there

676
00:50:15,642 --> 00:50:16,715
In a dream?

677
00:50:18,858 --> 00:50:20,981
I've been having weird dreams lately

678
00:50:27,193 --> 00:50:29,260
Ah, won't talk about it, forget it

679
00:50:30,899 --> 00:50:31,945
Hey

680
00:50:32,143 --> 00:50:33,818
Dreams are usually the opposite

681
00:50:35,355 --> 00:50:36,381
Maybe you're

682
00:50:37,314 --> 00:50:38,608
going to win the lottery?

683
00:50:40,588 --> 00:50:42,157
Jooan

684
00:50:44,492 --> 00:50:45,847
It's not that kind of dream

685
00:50:49,055 --> 00:50:50,894
I keep having similar dreams

686
00:50:52,457 --> 00:50:53,852
They all make sense

687
00:50:56,902 --> 00:50:58,132
You know, usually, dreams are a bit

688
00:50:58,330 --> 00:50:59,517
nonsensical

689
00:50:59,518 --> 00:51:00,576
or something like that

690
00:51:04,142 --> 00:51:05,261
But this one feels

691
00:51:07,649 --> 00:51:09,077
too real

692
00:51:10,432 --> 00:51:11,456
I hate it more

693
00:51:11,923 --> 00:51:13,129
Did you dream of me too?

694
00:51:14,090 --> 00:51:15,400
Then tell me

695
00:51:15,401 --> 00:51:16,433
Let me be careful

696
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:26,270
What is it?

697
00:51:26,714 --> 00:51:27,723
Why are you looking at me?

698
00:51:29,667 --> 00:51:30,771
Here's the king crab

699
00:51:31,006 --> 00:51:33,785
Huh? We didn't order king crab

700
00:51:33,899 --> 00:51:35,000
You didn't order?

701
00:51:36,624 --> 00:51:37,847
Isn't this the right table?

702
00:51:46,395 --> 00:51:47,645
Oh, yes, please

703
00:51:47,857 --> 00:51:49,679
- Thank you
- Okay!

704
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,163
- Wow
- King crab!

705
00:51:51,164 --> 00:51:52,434
- Let's eat
- Thank you

706
00:51:52,435 --> 00:51:53,574
Thank you

707
00:51:53,575 --> 00:51:54,581
You're the best

708
00:51:57,523 --> 00:51:58,639
Junho

709
00:52:00,724 --> 00:52:02,385
I'll be late today

710
00:52:04,657 --> 00:52:05,968
I went out to get some fresh air

711
00:52:07,345 --> 00:52:08,404
Yes

712
00:52:09,196 --> 00:52:11,339
So, all of you have girlfriends, right?

713
00:52:16,257 --> 00:52:17,292
What?

714
00:52:18,813 --> 00:52:20,188
Ah, even if you don't have girlfriends

715
00:52:20,189 --> 00:52:21,780
You must have someone
you're flirting with, right?

716
00:52:24,278 --> 00:52:25,852
Wow, no one? Even for flirting?

717
00:52:27,092 --> 00:52:29,028
Why are you talking like you have someone?

718
00:52:29,983 --> 00:52:31,410
Me? Of course

719
00:52:33,986 --> 00:52:35,046
I don't

720
00:52:36,222 --> 00:52:37,255
Right

721
00:52:38,209 --> 00:52:39,672
That's why I was all set
to enjoy your dating stories

722
00:52:39,673 --> 00:52:41,815
but looks like nobody's
got any action, huh?

723
00:52:42,350 --> 00:52:43,385
Would they?

724
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:45,597
Jeha Jeon

725
00:52:46,338 --> 00:52:47,836
That laugh of yours, it's like

726
00:52:47,837 --> 00:52:49,369
'I have someone' is it?

727
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:52,289
Come on, you don't have anyone either

728
00:52:52,290 --> 00:52:53,587
I do have someone

729
00:52:54,284 --> 00:52:55,293
You do?

730
00:52:55,294 --> 00:52:56,398
- Really?
- Seriously?

731
00:52:56,399 --> 00:52:57,903
- Hey, Jeha
- No way

732
00:52:58,524 --> 00:52:59,562
Well

733
00:53:00,071 --> 00:53:02,078
It's not like we're dating
or something like that

734
00:53:04,938 --> 00:53:05,946
- Is she pretty?
- Pretty?

735
00:53:06,946 --> 00:53:07,955
Well, she's like...

736
00:53:08,923 --> 00:53:10,121
Oh, who was it?

737
00:53:10,473 --> 00:53:11,594
That girl group member

738
00:53:11,595 --> 00:53:13,040
The one who's popular these days

739
00:53:13,041 --> 00:53:14,202
she kind of looks like her

740
00:53:16,586 --> 00:53:17,612
- Pretty?
- Pretty?

741
00:53:18,442 --> 00:53:20,144
Anything I say turns out to be 'pretty?'

742
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:23,047
Anyway, she's really smart

743
00:53:23,048 --> 00:53:24,088
Good at studying too

744
00:53:25,808 --> 00:53:26,870
- Pretty?
- Pretty?

745
00:53:27,054 --> 00:53:28,281
What are you saying?

746
00:53:28,892 --> 00:53:30,186
But the problem is

747
00:53:30,422 --> 00:53:31,943
Her brother, who's a year older than me

748
00:53:33,833 --> 00:53:34,859
- Pretty?
- Pretty?

749
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:36,830
- It's her brother
- Oh, her brother

750
00:53:36,831 --> 00:53:38,630
- Her brother could be pretty too
- Brother, brother

751
00:53:38,743 --> 00:53:40,002
- You're overdoing it
- Yes, sir

752
00:53:40,003 --> 00:53:41,908
Your seat is over here
in the 'O'conomy section

753
00:53:42,201 --> 00:53:43,326
Here it is

754
00:53:45,058 --> 00:53:46,216
Ah, it's hot!

755
00:53:46,672 --> 00:53:47,955
Hey, what's this, hey, 'O'conomy

756
00:53:48,389 --> 00:53:49,398
'O'conomy

757
00:53:51,963 --> 00:53:53,235
I know that...

758
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:55,084
It's economy

759
00:53:55,336 --> 00:53:56,972
Just misspoke for a moment

760
00:53:56,973 --> 00:53:58,098
You've never even been on a plane

761
00:53:58,099 --> 00:53:59,273
What are you talking about?

762
00:53:59,394 --> 00:54:00,576
Of course

763
00:54:01,611 --> 00:54:02,668
Hey

764
00:54:02,669 --> 00:54:03,886
The only ones here who
have been on a plane are

765
00:54:03,887 --> 00:54:05,093
Hwan and Haru, right?

766
00:54:07,201 --> 00:54:08,357
I haven't been on one either

767
00:54:11,605 --> 00:54:12,655
Why?

768
00:54:12,903 --> 00:54:13,982
Your brother...

769
00:54:14,866 --> 00:54:15,947
I lied

770
00:54:18,643 --> 00:54:20,543
I've never been to
the US to see my brother

771
00:54:24,751 --> 00:54:26,102
He was embarrassed of me

772
00:54:26,103 --> 00:54:27,467
because I was sick

773
00:54:29,305 --> 00:54:30,326
Well

774
00:54:30,705 --> 00:54:32,493
Our whole family was like that

775
00:54:35,752 --> 00:54:36,766
But

776
00:54:37,684 --> 00:54:39,435
That 'O'conomy thing

777
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:41,520
I'd like to try it with you guys sometime

778
00:54:41,521 --> 00:54:44,367
Ah, I know it's economy

779
00:54:44,456 --> 00:54:45,469
'O'conomy seat

780
00:54:58,430 --> 00:55:01,334
- It's on, It's on
- Come with me, let's go together

781
00:55:41,172 --> 00:55:42,272
Me too, me too!

782
00:55:42,273 --> 00:55:43,284
Go, Go, to the snack bar

783
00:55:43,285 --> 00:55:44,409
- Milk for me
- I'll have a chocolate bar

784
00:55:44,410 --> 00:55:45,701
- I'm getting a hot dog
- Anything for me

785
00:55:46,199 --> 00:55:47,351
What are you sorry about?

786
00:56:03,905 --> 00:56:05,717
One, two, three

787
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:10,982
What? Did you miss me?

788
00:56:27,675 --> 00:56:28,720
So

789
00:56:30,823 --> 00:56:32,180
I feel like to start over

790
00:56:34,228 --> 00:56:35,299
It's my life

791
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:38,201
And it feels like I haven't made
enough of my own choices

792
00:56:40,247 --> 00:56:41,290
This time

793
00:56:42,867 --> 00:56:44,537
I want to make my own decisions

794
00:56:46,408 --> 00:56:47,526
That's why I came back

795
00:56:48,223 --> 00:56:49,274
Here

796
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:51,949
What choice do you want to make?

797
00:56:57,302 --> 00:56:58,313
Start

798
00:57:01,135 --> 00:57:02,255
For a new beginning,

799
00:57:02,985 --> 00:57:04,275
I want to choose it myself

800
00:57:07,453 --> 00:57:08,544
My beginnings were always

801
00:57:09,002 --> 00:57:10,500
too weak

802
00:57:12,597 --> 00:57:13,764
With my dad

803
00:57:15,206 --> 00:57:16,648
With you guys

804
00:57:19,034 --> 00:57:20,530
In any relationship

805
00:57:24,534 --> 00:57:25,692
When I was in kindergarten

806
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:30,103
I let go my friend's hand

807
00:57:31,868 --> 00:57:33,675
that was holding mine

808
00:57:36,984 --> 00:57:37,998
From the moment

809
00:57:38,373 --> 00:57:39,574
I let go that hand

810
00:57:42,287 --> 00:57:43,376
My start was

811
00:57:44,375 --> 00:57:45,593
already failed

812
00:57:49,610 --> 00:57:51,415
That irreversible beginning

813
00:57:52,748 --> 00:57:55,261
became an excuse for me

814
00:57:59,437 --> 00:58:00,566
An easy excuse

815
00:58:00,567 --> 00:58:01,949
for things I should have done

816
00:58:02,655 --> 00:58:03,701
but didn't

817
00:58:07,363 --> 00:58:09,486
No matter what,
I'm just this kind of person

818
00:58:13,542 --> 00:58:15,622
and to justify that I've already messed up

819
00:58:16,693 --> 00:58:17,776
That kind of excuse

820
00:58:18,804 --> 00:58:21,443
How can you change
what happened in the past?

821
00:58:23,071 --> 00:58:24,071
Right

822
00:58:25,828 --> 00:58:27,314
I was late then

823
00:58:28,681 --> 00:58:30,395
And maybe I'm late now too

824
00:58:30,567 --> 00:58:31,611
But

825
00:58:34,908 --> 00:58:36,537
If I start again and again,

826
00:58:37,882 --> 00:58:40,373
it's neither being too late nor a failure

827
00:58:42,877 --> 00:58:44,010
If I can let go,

828
00:58:44,011 --> 00:58:45,564
I believe I can grab it again

829
00:58:47,532 --> 00:58:48,545
So

830
00:58:50,295 --> 00:58:51,721
I want to try to start over

831
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:54,907
Even for you guys

832
00:58:58,376 --> 00:58:59,985
I've started wanting to try politics

833
00:59:01,061 --> 00:59:02,577
The power of politics itself

834
00:59:02,578 --> 00:59:03,661
isn't bad

835
00:59:05,121 --> 00:59:07,142
The people who use that power badly

836
00:59:07,143 --> 00:59:08,517
are the real problem in the end

837
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:11,065
If the problem is people

838
00:59:12,075 --> 00:59:13,720
If I can be different,

839
00:59:14,954 --> 00:59:16,000
then

840
00:59:17,910 --> 00:59:18,977
a new beginning

841
00:59:18,978 --> 00:59:20,246
seems possible

842
00:59:22,886 --> 00:59:23,896
Well

843
00:59:24,577 --> 00:59:25,592
This might just be

844
00:59:26,354 --> 00:59:27,590
part of becoming

845
00:59:27,591 --> 00:59:28,911
one of those mundane adults

846
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:34,393
Well, I...

847
00:59:34,761 --> 00:59:36,294
it's not advice or something like that

848
00:59:36,929 --> 00:59:39,032
it's just my opinion

849
00:59:40,163 --> 00:59:41,312
If that decision is

850
00:59:41,704 --> 00:59:43,475
for you then I totally agree with you

851
00:59:44,752 --> 00:59:46,302
But don't do it for us

852
00:59:47,529 --> 00:59:48,995
Why do you want to take

853
00:59:48,996 --> 00:59:50,020
on our starts too?

854
00:59:53,899 --> 00:59:55,228
And thinking that I can

855
00:59:55,229 --> 00:59:56,800
change someone's life

856
00:59:57,935 --> 00:59:59,649
I feel like that makes everyone unhappy

857
01:00:03,541 --> 01:00:05,509
Still, I want to try

858
01:00:08,408 --> 01:00:09,436
I don't want to be an adult

859
01:00:09,437 --> 01:00:11,083
who can do something but doesn't

860
01:00:12,141 --> 01:00:13,148
Not again

861
01:00:15,485 --> 01:00:16,660
I understand how you feel, bro

862
01:00:18,147 --> 01:00:19,163
But

863
01:00:20,270 --> 01:00:22,487
Even looking back at the
times we spent together,

864
01:00:23,177 --> 01:00:24,213
like Dogeon said,

865
01:00:25,394 --> 01:00:26,718
no one can

866
01:00:26,719 --> 01:00:27,933
save anyone

867
01:00:30,097 --> 01:00:31,597
We were happy then

868
01:00:32,674 --> 01:00:34,076
And it's true that

869
01:00:34,077 --> 01:00:35,142
we supported each other

870
01:00:37,305 --> 01:00:38,985
But it's also true that

871
01:00:40,473 --> 01:00:41,664
we've grown apart like this now

872
01:00:50,985 --> 01:00:52,019
Hwan

873
01:00:54,005 --> 01:00:55,925
I'm grateful, even just for the thought

874
01:00:57,711 --> 01:00:58,778
Really

875
01:01:23,832 --> 01:01:24,882
Before we start

876
01:01:24,883 --> 01:01:26,456
Let me briefly explain
the background

877
01:01:27,473 --> 01:01:29,295
It's the 1920s during
the Japanese occupation

878
01:01:29,296 --> 01:01:32,096
The setting is inside a train in Seoul

879
01:01:32,364 --> 01:01:34,036
First, let's look at the theme

880
01:01:34,250 --> 01:01:35,931
The exploitation by the Japanese

881
01:01:35,932 --> 01:01:38,266
Acknowledging that first

882
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:40,903
It expresses

883
01:01:40,904 --> 01:01:42,016
the miserable life of our people

884
01:01:42,017 --> 01:01:43,372
We'll touch on that too

885
01:01:55,024 --> 01:01:56,332
Thank you

886
01:01:58,235 --> 01:01:59,277
Hwan Kim

887
01:01:59,278 --> 01:02:00,286
Hwan Kim?

888
01:02:04,965 --> 01:02:05,967
Thank you

889
01:02:18,118 --> 01:02:19,404
Where are these messages coming from?

890
01:02:22,789 --> 01:02:25,862
Urgent messages from Dogeon

891
01:02:34,612 --> 01:02:38,634
Obituary message for Cein Min

892
01:02:40,693 --> 01:02:41,703
Oh, come on

893
01:02:50,268 --> 01:02:51,677
The power is off...

894
01:02:51,678 --> 01:02:53,104
After the beep, voice message...

895
01:02:53,105 --> 01:02:54,133
What?

896
01:03:01,028 --> 01:03:02,071
Oh, Dogeon

897
01:03:02,463 --> 01:03:03,485
Sorry

898
01:03:03,486 --> 01:03:05,114
I can only check my phone on weekends

899
01:03:05,115 --> 01:03:06,148
I just saw it now

900
01:03:06,574 --> 01:03:07,589
Hey

901
01:03:07,918 --> 01:03:09,418
What's with Cein's message?

902
01:03:10,016 --> 01:03:11,849
I did that with him first

903
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:13,155
Now it's your turn?

904
01:03:14,288 --> 01:03:15,891
Because you also sent
the message, for a moment I...

905
01:03:33,409 --> 01:03:34,597
Deceased Cein Min / Chief mourner: Youngho Min
Cein...

906
01:03:36,230 --> 01:03:37,725
Set a motel on fire and

907
01:03:40,012 --> 01:03:41,130
committed suicide

908
01:03:43,399 --> 01:03:45,128
Chamjoheun Funeral Home
The funeral is tomorrow morning

909
01:03:47,281 --> 01:03:48,406
But I just can't

910
01:03:48,982 --> 01:03:50,860
skip work three days in a row

911
01:03:51,181 --> 01:03:52,302
It's too much and uncomfortable

912
01:03:53,467 --> 01:03:54,496
So, maybe...

913
01:03:55,532 --> 01:03:56,882
Can you go there for me?

914
01:03:58,191 --> 01:03:59,899
What about the others?

915
01:04:00,686 --> 01:04:02,534
I can't reach Jeha and Hosu

916
01:04:04,242 --> 01:04:05,348
They're in the hospital

917
01:04:05,349 --> 01:04:06,914
Even if I reach out,
they likely won't make it

918
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:08,865
Jooan is...

919
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:10,779
at the police station right now

920
01:04:12,324 --> 01:04:13,487
Sorry, bro

921
01:04:14,474 --> 01:04:16,035
I should have been there

922
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:27,086
1 missed call from Cein

923
01:05:32,958 --> 01:05:33,998
Hwan

924
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:38,862
Can I

925
01:05:41,384 --> 01:05:42,737
call you

926
01:05:44,253 --> 01:05:45,524
sometimes?

927
01:05:55,065 --> 01:05:56,324
Of course, you can

928
01:05:56,921 --> 01:05:58,062
Anytime

929
01:06:00,083 --> 01:06:01,429
By the way, Cein

930
01:06:02,344 --> 01:06:03,474
seeing you get drunk

931
01:06:03,475 --> 01:06:06,159
you're kind of cute, you know

932
01:06:06,586 --> 01:06:07,623
What are you saying?

933
01:06:08,355 --> 01:06:09,375
I am

934
01:06:11,687 --> 01:06:12,740
cute

935
01:06:16,173 --> 01:06:17,216
Bro

936
01:06:19,321 --> 01:06:20,724
I wish people

937
01:06:22,123 --> 01:06:24,596
would remember

938
01:06:25,659 --> 01:06:27,534
Cein Min

939
01:06:27,535 --> 01:06:29,074
as a somewhat fun guy

940
01:06:30,525 --> 01:06:32,907
Not just negative stories about my mom

941
01:06:33,453 --> 01:06:36,326
or me getting expelled

942
01:06:38,639 --> 01:06:40,278
I also play the piano

943
01:06:42,761 --> 01:06:44,502
Quite well, honestly

944
01:06:47,254 --> 01:06:49,573
Yeah, Cein Min, you're

945
01:06:50,210 --> 01:06:51,964
- kind of interesting
- Right?

946
01:06:52,021 --> 01:06:53,145
- Yeah
- Bro

947
01:06:54,136 --> 01:06:55,828
- Am I fun?
- You're fun

948
01:06:55,829 --> 01:06:57,384
- Funny?
- Funny

949
01:06:59,593 --> 01:07:02,401
I'm really funny once you get to know me

950
01:07:08,517 --> 01:07:10,782
But people are afraid of me

951
01:07:15,184 --> 01:07:16,618
They just don't know

952
01:07:17,956 --> 01:07:19,374
All cowards

953
01:07:19,642 --> 01:07:20,677
They just don't know

954
01:07:27,183 --> 01:07:28,224
But

955
01:07:29,445 --> 01:07:31,381
when you honked your horn

956
01:07:31,382 --> 01:07:33,094
in front of the house earlier

957
01:07:35,990 --> 01:07:37,032
honestly

958
01:07:38,527 --> 01:07:39,651
I felt a bit happy inside

959
01:07:41,790 --> 01:07:43,744
That you didn't forget and came to find me

960
01:07:43,938 --> 01:07:45,238
I was really grateful

961
01:07:49,151 --> 01:07:50,448
I didn't even know

962
01:07:53,444 --> 01:07:55,627
Maybe I was waiting
for something like this

963
01:07:58,995 --> 01:08:00,137
Was I lonely?

964
01:08:02,878 --> 01:08:04,060
Is that really it?

965
01:09:32,926 --> 01:09:33,983
Is this

966
01:09:35,383 --> 01:09:36,805
what you want to be your end?

967
01:10:12,599 --> 01:10:17,428
Poverty / Part-time job /
Container / Family

968
01:10:17,429 --> 01:10:22,377
Naeri Gas Station / Dogeon /
Alcohol / Left ear / Rule breaker
