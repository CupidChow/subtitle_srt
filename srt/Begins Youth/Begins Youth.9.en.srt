in safe conditions under the supervision of their guardians.

2
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,419
The teacher?

3
00:00:56,794 --> 00:00:58,136
But why should I

4
00:00:58,137 --> 00:00:59,509
keep it secret from Cein?

5
00:01:10,769 --> 00:01:11,719
Oh?

6
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:15,459
This is Cein's house key

7
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:19,173
Where did you get it?

8
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:50,779
Ma'am?

9
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:08,513
What about her?

10
00:03:09,562 --> 00:03:10,727
Why is she in danger?

11
00:03:15,514 --> 00:03:16,890
No way she didn't...

12
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,454
Again?

13
00:03:29,022 --> 00:03:30,843
But how do you know...

14
00:03:34,619 --> 00:03:35,733
what hasn't happened yet?

15
00:04:33,945 --> 00:04:35,092
911, what's your emergency?

16
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,379
Sir

17
00:04:40,464 --> 00:04:41,786
Please help me

18
00:04:43,177 --> 00:04:45,129
I think...

19
00:04:46,448 --> 00:04:47,598
my brother's dead

20
00:04:49,527 --> 00:04:51,139
He's bleeding in the head

21
00:04:52,067 --> 00:04:53,370
Please come quickly

22
00:04:56,161 --> 00:04:58,679
Jeha was bleeding in the head...

23
00:05:13,192 --> 00:05:14,529
I understand it's hard

24
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:16,123
to recall what happened

25
00:05:17,176 --> 00:05:18,319
But thanks to

26
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,013
your swift call

27
00:05:20,429 --> 00:05:22,073
he's less hurt

28
00:05:22,186 --> 00:05:24,278
He was so shocked that

29
00:05:24,384 --> 00:05:26,389
it's been days, but he's still like this

30
00:05:28,966 --> 00:05:30,002
Mingook

31
00:05:30,401 --> 00:05:31,550
Wipe your tears

32
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:34,049
and tell them what happened

33
00:05:35,996 --> 00:05:37,017
Ok

34
00:05:39,702 --> 00:05:40,752
On that day...

35
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,620
I was on my way

36
00:05:42,978 --> 00:05:44,624
to an internet cafe with my friends

37
00:06:19,768 --> 00:06:25,711
If you continue to hate me,
I'll just go and die there. Just as your mom did

38
00:06:40,003 --> 00:06:41,034
What's all this?

39
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:43,161
I...

40
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:46,824
saw Jeha going into that house

41
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:49,887
I thought he might be in danger...

42
00:06:52,032 --> 00:06:53,807
so I followed him

43
00:06:53,812 --> 00:06:54,813
Annoyed, aren't you?

44
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:55,993
- But inside
- Wanna hit me?

45
00:06:55,994 --> 00:06:57,034
Go ahead

46
00:06:57,035 --> 00:06:58,589
- Cein Min...
- Hit me!

47
00:06:58,896 --> 00:07:00,876
- Hey
- Cein was...

48
00:07:01,127 --> 00:07:02,477
beating Jeha up

49
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,537
He said he was going to kill him

50
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:09,372
I tried my best

51
00:07:09,536 --> 00:07:11,049
to stop him

52
00:07:11,939 --> 00:07:13,021
But he...

53
00:07:13,743 --> 00:07:15,081
hit my brother

54
00:07:16,006 --> 00:07:17,235
with a brick...

55
00:07:20,137 --> 00:07:21,195
Let's leave here

56
00:07:23,537 --> 00:07:25,129
Stop and let's leave

57
00:07:25,271 --> 00:07:26,290
Please?

58
00:08:08,969 --> 00:08:10,253
- I was so scared
- Sir

59
00:08:12,269 --> 00:08:13,581
Please help me

60
00:08:13,582 --> 00:08:17,505
Witness statement of stating that he was scared
because Cein beat up Jeha

61
00:08:26,691 --> 00:08:27,946
This is what

62
00:08:28,489 --> 00:08:30,190
Mingook has testified

63
00:08:31,709 --> 00:08:33,701
Is there anything different
from what you know?

64
00:08:38,884 --> 00:08:40,151
A few days ago...

65
00:08:41,332 --> 00:08:42,426
some people

66
00:08:42,428 --> 00:08:44,097
saw you fighting with Jeha...

67
00:08:44,603 --> 00:08:45,805
after you found out that

68
00:08:45,807 --> 00:08:47,087
he had been tracking you

69
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,760
Is that why you struck Jeha?

70
00:08:57,546 --> 00:08:58,584
Cein

71
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:00,991
According to Mingook...

72
00:09:01,635 --> 00:09:02,953
you sent a text to Jeha

73
00:09:02,954 --> 00:09:04,397
that you'd kill him

74
00:09:05,668 --> 00:09:07,398
The whole situation's against you...

75
00:09:07,984 --> 00:09:08,992
by a large degree

76
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,074
Mr. Min

77
00:09:16,288 --> 00:09:18,435
If Cein continues refusing to talk...

78
00:09:18,954 --> 00:09:20,009
you are aware that

79
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:21,162
this case will be reported

80
00:09:21,163 --> 00:09:22,572
based on Mingook's statement...

81
00:09:23,017 --> 00:09:24,070
right?

82
00:09:26,446 --> 00:09:27,436
Cein Min

83
00:09:28,265 --> 00:09:29,277
Is it true...

84
00:09:29,695 --> 00:09:30,730
or not?

85
00:09:31,292 --> 00:09:32,543
Come on, say something

86
00:09:42,801 --> 00:09:44,162
They were always together...

87
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:45,801
almost everyday

88
00:09:47,077 --> 00:09:48,112
Did he...

89
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,987
really say he did it?

90
00:09:51,207 --> 00:09:52,416
I don't get it

91
00:09:52,765 --> 00:09:54,086
How can he...

92
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:11,915
Why? Why aren't you eating up?

93
00:10:16,219 --> 00:10:18,181
What are you worried about?

94
00:10:19,147 --> 00:10:20,275
You know Cein

95
00:10:21,381 --> 00:10:22,865
Our elderly might look cold on the outside

96
00:10:22,866 --> 00:10:23,912
but he couldn't have done it

97
00:10:24,282 --> 00:10:25,340
Especially not to

98
00:10:25,341 --> 00:10:26,364
Jeha

99
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,711
We just need to

100
00:10:31,712 --> 00:10:33,141
stand our ground and wait

101
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:35,564
The truth will come out...

102
00:10:36,173 --> 00:10:37,731
and everything will be back to normal

103
00:10:38,468 --> 00:10:39,446
I bet

104
00:10:42,326 --> 00:10:43,368
What do you mean by...

105
00:10:44,275 --> 00:10:45,297
"back to normal?"

106
00:10:45,359 --> 00:10:46,423
Here

107
00:10:46,424 --> 00:10:47,766
Here, where we're at right now

108
00:10:49,957 --> 00:10:51,609
Here, where all my bros are at

109
00:10:53,084 --> 00:10:54,920
I thought you were the smart one...

110
00:10:55,699 --> 00:10:56,704
but I guess not

111
00:10:58,613 --> 00:10:59,644
We?

112
00:11:02,432 --> 00:11:03,474
My bro?

113
00:11:06,068 --> 00:11:07,736
Jooan, have you seen Haru today?

114
00:11:09,487 --> 00:11:10,576
Is he also doing the interview?

115
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:15,079
Hey, Jooan

116
00:11:15,796 --> 00:11:16,978
What

117
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,461
What?

118
00:11:20,281 --> 00:11:22,163
Are you still pissed off at Haru?

119
00:11:23,668 --> 00:11:25,600
Don't be so petty

120
00:11:26,691 --> 00:11:29,074
You know he's sick. Don't do that to him

121
00:11:29,075 --> 00:11:31,086
I didn't do anything to him!

122
00:11:35,192 --> 00:11:36,762
Hey, Jooan

123
00:11:37,794 --> 00:11:39,807
- What's going on?
- Seriously!

124
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,514
Leave me alone!

125
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:48,925
It's not real!

126
00:11:55,237 --> 00:11:57,135
Hey, where did you go?

127
00:11:58,788 --> 00:12:00,187
None of it is real!

128
00:12:07,412 --> 00:12:08,688
Your friend

129
00:12:08,689 --> 00:12:09,974
doesn't exist

130
00:12:11,513 --> 00:12:13,443
It's not real, you idiot

131
00:12:15,612 --> 00:12:17,794
No, he was right here until just now

132
00:12:18,272 --> 00:12:19,244
Look around

133
00:12:19,779 --> 00:12:20,919
You're alone

134
00:12:22,586 --> 00:12:24,150
You were alone from the start

135
00:12:24,874 --> 00:12:26,229
Your friend doesn't exist

136
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,333
you lunatic!

137
00:12:30,048 --> 00:12:31,591
Jooan, you also met him

138
00:12:31,592 --> 00:12:33,179
before

139
00:12:42,383 --> 00:12:43,415
This is the one

140
00:12:45,463 --> 00:12:47,250
This is the friend you were talking

141
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:51,726
You were talking to your
own reflection in the glass!

142
00:12:59,095 --> 00:13:00,129
How...

143
00:13:01,852 --> 00:13:03,188
How did it become this bad?

144
00:13:05,922 --> 00:13:07,765
How did you end up like this?

145
00:13:08,983 --> 00:13:11,287
You should've told us!

146
00:13:29,701 --> 00:13:30,735
Haru

147
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:33,137
Are you sick again?

148
00:14:49,456 --> 00:14:51,722
- Where have you been?
- Huh?

149
00:14:52,871 --> 00:14:54,492
I was always here

150
00:14:55,217 --> 00:14:56,739
Oh, you mean Jooan?

151
00:14:59,782 --> 00:15:01,266
He's an interesting guy

152
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:03,323
Sometimes, he can be stupid

153
00:15:03,324 --> 00:15:04,570
and very silly

154
00:15:40,576 --> 00:15:41,860
What the

155
00:15:43,492 --> 00:15:44,675
I thought you weren't here

156
00:15:44,676 --> 00:15:45,907
I'm always here

157
00:15:46,927 --> 00:15:48,030
Jooan seemed to be

158
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:49,073
avoiding you today

159
00:15:49,074 --> 00:15:50,297
It must've been upsetting

160
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:53,085
Of course, I'm here to console you

161
00:15:54,544 --> 00:15:55,568
Thanks

162
00:16:00,684 --> 00:16:02,477
But the thing about Jooan...

163
00:16:04,177 --> 00:16:05,275
I didn't mention it to you

164
00:16:05,276 --> 00:16:06,500
because you might feel disappointed

165
00:16:06,501 --> 00:16:07,576
How did you find out?

166
00:16:07,677 --> 00:16:09,930
I know everything about you

167
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:11,278
How?

168
00:16:13,066 --> 00:16:14,200
Because I'm you

169
00:16:42,981 --> 00:16:43,993
Mom

170
00:16:45,327 --> 00:16:46,478
Yes

171
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:52,666
You sent my phone for repair?

172
00:16:53,091 --> 00:16:55,219
Yes, I think you dropped
and broke it that day

173
00:16:56,895 --> 00:16:58,485
Then can I borrow yours?

174
00:17:01,672 --> 00:17:04,007
I want to call Cein

175
00:17:05,669 --> 00:17:07,133
Call who?

176
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:09,205
Are you out of your mind?

177
00:17:09,972 --> 00:17:10,987
You're here in this state

178
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,181
because of him

179
00:17:12,182 --> 00:17:13,647
I'm fine, really

180
00:17:14,906 --> 00:17:16,665
The doctor said
I'm recovering more quickly

181
00:17:16,892 --> 00:17:18,296
than expected because I'm young

182
00:17:18,297 --> 00:17:20,176
Why do you omit the part where he said

183
00:17:20,179 --> 00:17:21,277
they'll run more tests

184
00:17:21,278 --> 00:17:22,644
and you must get some rest?

185
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:24,769
You will stay in bed and be discharged

186
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:26,326
without causing any trouble, ok?

187
00:17:29,714 --> 00:17:31,570
I studied really hard this time

188
00:17:31,693 --> 00:17:33,048
for the midterm exam

189
00:17:34,503 --> 00:17:36,722
Dad will be pleased if my grades go up

190
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:38,840
So Mom

191
00:17:39,413 --> 00:17:40,475
I'll go and take the exam...

192
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,152
I already discussed it with your school

193
00:17:42,743 --> 00:17:44,762
They'll send one of the teachers

194
00:17:44,878 --> 00:17:46,917
and let you take the exam here

195
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:51,892
They don't have to do that

196
00:17:52,051 --> 00:17:53,091
I know...

197
00:17:53,324 --> 00:17:54,397
you're trying to go

198
00:17:54,398 --> 00:17:55,897
to the school to see Cein

199
00:17:56,688 --> 00:17:58,125
He's suspended...

200
00:17:58,885 --> 00:18:00,446
so he won't be in school anyway

201
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:01,933
What?

202
00:18:02,406 --> 00:18:03,458
They suspended him?

203
00:18:19,324 --> 00:18:20,332
I'm here

204
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:21,784
Yes

205
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:24,105
Did the interview go well?

206
00:18:25,553 --> 00:18:26,613
Yes

207
00:18:27,949 --> 00:18:29,147
You must be tired

208
00:18:29,849 --> 00:18:32,133
Did your father go to work straight away?

209
00:18:33,022 --> 00:18:34,030
Yes

210
00:18:35,162 --> 00:18:36,678
He wants to know...

211
00:18:41,832 --> 00:18:43,456
how Jeha's doing...

212
00:18:44,441 --> 00:18:45,739
in the hospital

213
00:18:47,413 --> 00:18:49,597
I'll give him a call

214
00:18:51,762 --> 00:18:53,801
I'll go home...

215
00:18:54,186 --> 00:18:56,240
to do some housework, and come back

216
00:18:56,626 --> 00:18:58,185
Stay with your brother, ok?

217
00:18:59,254 --> 00:19:00,311
Do you hear me?

218
00:19:01,353 --> 00:19:02,355
Mingook

219
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,054
- Yes
- Can I talk to you for a minute?

220
00:19:17,105 --> 00:19:19,313
While I'm at home...

221
00:19:19,924 --> 00:19:21,609
can I ask you to watch over Jeha...

222
00:19:22,349 --> 00:19:23,683
make sure he doesn't get out

223
00:19:23,684 --> 00:19:24,989
and meet anyone?

224
00:19:26,328 --> 00:19:28,520
Never let him use a phone, ok?

225
00:19:34,042 --> 00:19:35,284
I won't be long

226
00:19:35,628 --> 00:19:36,665
Have some sleep

227
00:20:20,667 --> 00:20:21,800
With things going on...

228
00:20:22,581 --> 00:20:24,533
it must be hard to focus on your studies

229
00:20:25,756 --> 00:20:27,977
Besides, you're close with both of them

230
00:20:28,805 --> 00:20:31,126
It must be awkward to take sides

231
00:20:32,612 --> 00:20:35,306
As the attack was more violent
than I thought...

232
00:20:36,314 --> 00:20:37,819
the School Violence Deliberation Committee

233
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,610
will be held the day after tomorrow

234
00:20:40,022 --> 00:20:42,290
I believe it won't last long...

235
00:20:43,068 --> 00:20:44,213
since Cein Min

236
00:20:44,214 --> 00:20:46,144
admitted to everything

237
00:20:49,509 --> 00:20:51,575
Did Cein really do it?

238
00:20:53,898 --> 00:20:56,044
Cein admitted to everything

239
00:20:56,497 --> 00:20:58,723
the victim's brother has testified

240
00:20:59,818 --> 00:21:00,861
If it weren't true...

241
00:21:01,286 --> 00:21:02,777
there would've been another narrative

242
00:21:03,741 --> 00:21:04,943
School transfer...

243
00:21:05,372 --> 00:21:07,647
or expulsion will be
the most likely outcome

244
00:21:09,552 --> 00:21:10,581
What do you think?

245
00:21:11,215 --> 00:21:12,238
Pardon?

246
00:21:15,109 --> 00:21:17,368
- About what...
- Oh, I just...

247
00:21:18,124 --> 00:21:20,648
wanted to know your opinion

248
00:21:21,784 --> 00:21:22,794
It is true that

249
00:21:22,986 --> 00:21:24,074
lately, Cein has been

250
00:21:24,075 --> 00:21:25,861
acting dangerously

251
00:21:36,268 --> 00:21:37,358
Transfer...

252
00:21:38,427 --> 00:21:39,436
school?

253
00:21:39,946 --> 00:21:42,219
I'll look up schools near company housing

254
00:21:43,603 --> 00:21:44,853
Despite how much you wanted...

255
00:21:45,902 --> 00:21:47,536
I shouldn't have let you stay

256
00:22:28,684 --> 00:22:29,951
You punk

257
00:22:29,952 --> 00:22:31,983
How dare you ignore my message?

258
00:22:32,715 --> 00:22:34,098
I've been easy on you lately, haven't I?

259
00:22:34,195 --> 00:22:35,254
Come on

260
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,334
Hey, what's going on?

261
00:22:45,259 --> 00:22:46,604
I also know

262
00:22:46,605 --> 00:22:47,892
what happened between Cein and Jeha

263
00:22:48,815 --> 00:22:50,717
I don't feel good about it, too...

264
00:22:51,226 --> 00:22:52,356
but we talked about this. There's

265
00:22:52,357 --> 00:22:53,866
- nothing we can do...
- Shit

266
00:22:58,399 --> 00:23:00,563
Shut up if you don't know anything

267
00:23:01,255 --> 00:23:02,513
What did you just say?

268
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:04,453
Sh... Shit?

269
00:23:06,248 --> 00:23:07,419
You made a big mistake, Jooan Kim

270
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,451
Apologize this instant

271
00:23:09,673 --> 00:23:10,794
Don't make me get mad at you

272
00:23:12,154 --> 00:23:14,762
I told you to leave me alone

273
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:21,911
Hey, I'm warning you

274
00:23:22,784 --> 00:23:23,981
In count of three

275
00:23:23,982 --> 00:23:25,153
you'll find yourself in big trouble

276
00:23:25,807 --> 00:23:27,778
One, two!

277
00:23:32,905 --> 00:23:33,936
Two and a half

278
00:23:36,493 --> 00:23:37,536
Two and three-quarter

279
00:24:05,548 --> 00:24:06,581
Hosu

280
00:24:10,705 --> 00:24:12,055
Haru...

281
00:24:16,545 --> 00:24:17,638
What about Haru?

282
00:24:28,062 --> 00:24:32,531
Schizophrenia

283
00:24:33,185 --> 00:24:34,536
Schizophrenia

284
00:24:48,268 --> 00:24:50,144
- Excuse me, sir
- Oh?

285
00:24:50,145 --> 00:24:51,281
Yes, Hosu

286
00:24:54,527 --> 00:24:56,118
Is there something you want to say?

287
00:24:56,278 --> 00:24:57,335
Yes

288
00:25:00,369 --> 00:25:01,733
It's not about me

289
00:25:02,878 --> 00:25:04,157
It's about my friend

290
00:25:04,398 --> 00:25:05,752
I'm worried about him

291
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:08,657
What is it?

292
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:11,276
My friend's a little ill

293
00:25:13,113 --> 00:25:14,585
He takes his own reflection on the mirror

294
00:25:14,586 --> 00:25:15,660
as his friend

295
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,713
At first, I thought...

296
00:25:19,282 --> 00:25:21,091
he really made a new friend

297
00:25:22,137 --> 00:25:23,202
I mean...

298
00:25:24,032 --> 00:25:25,237
I wished he did

299
00:25:26,259 --> 00:25:27,856
After Haru transferred to a new school

300
00:25:28,171 --> 00:25:30,201
and made new friends

301
00:25:30,687 --> 00:25:32,897
his condition improved

302
00:25:34,887 --> 00:25:35,898
So I thought...

303
00:25:37,321 --> 00:25:38,465
my son...

304
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:40,948
could get better, too...

305
00:25:42,244 --> 00:25:43,260
like...

306
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:49,372
other kids

307
00:25:55,973 --> 00:25:57,569
It's been difficult

308
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:58,681
not only on him

309
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:00,911
but on you as well

310
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:04,936
I fully understand

311
00:26:07,152 --> 00:26:08,179
But

312
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:10,577
it is true that his symptoms

313
00:26:10,578 --> 00:26:11,898
have worsened

314
00:26:12,308 --> 00:26:13,565
If possible

315
00:26:13,566 --> 00:26:16,177
I'd like you to hospitalize him right away

316
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,350
It's the middle of the semester

317
00:26:23,586 --> 00:26:24,789
And he told me

318
00:26:24,923 --> 00:26:26,857
after the glass was broken

319
00:26:27,165 --> 00:26:29,495
he no longer sees the imaginary friend

320
00:26:29,614 --> 00:26:30,894
It could be that

321
00:26:31,067 --> 00:26:32,925
the imaginary friend disappeared

322
00:26:32,926 --> 00:26:34,939
temporarily due to a mental shock

323
00:26:35,628 --> 00:26:36,663
But

324
00:26:36,664 --> 00:26:37,829
if we don't treat

325
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,894
the fundamental trauma
he isn't remembering

326
00:26:39,895 --> 00:26:41,612
it will appear in a different form

327
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,958
Sir

328
00:26:50,047 --> 00:26:52,506
Could you meet up with my friend?

329
00:26:53,517 --> 00:26:54,554
No

330
00:26:56,268 --> 00:26:57,888
We'll hospitalize him during the vacation

331
00:27:01,182 --> 00:27:02,612
If the rumor spreads again...

332
00:27:03,398 --> 00:27:04,750
it won't be good for Haru

333
00:27:05,229 --> 00:27:07,290
Of course. I'd be glad to

334
00:27:15,434 --> 00:27:17,212
They might redevelop the area...

335
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:24,038
Didn't you say they won't?

336
00:27:25,177 --> 00:27:26,187
I mean...

337
00:27:26,727 --> 00:27:27,983
they just might

338
00:27:28,828 --> 00:27:30,072
I want us to have a plan

339
00:27:30,073 --> 00:27:31,405
just in case

340
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:33,777
I asked around

341
00:27:34,529 --> 00:27:35,689
If we get the deposit

342
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:36,764
there's a place we can go

343
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:38,077
It's a bit small

344
00:27:44,106 --> 00:27:45,201
There's no...

345
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:46,935
deposit

346
00:27:55,502 --> 00:27:56,511
Why isn't there...

347
00:27:57,719 --> 00:27:58,734
a deposit?

348
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,550
I'm asking you

349
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:06,881
Did you use it?

350
00:28:09,096 --> 00:28:10,549
Did you use the deposit in advance?

351
00:28:13,457 --> 00:28:14,597
What did you use it for?

352
00:28:16,186 --> 00:28:18,304
I paid your father's hospital bill...

353
00:28:20,645 --> 00:28:22,125
Dohyeon's...

354
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:23,927
settlement fee...

355
00:28:24,749 --> 00:28:25,898
living expenses...

356
00:28:26,692 --> 00:28:28,715
- here and there...
- Here and there?

357
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:31,005
I gave you the money

358
00:28:31,917 --> 00:28:33,027
I gave you the rent

359
00:28:33,028 --> 00:28:34,418
and the living expenses every month

360
00:28:35,423 --> 00:28:37,670
Even for the hospital bills
and Dohyeon's settlement...

361
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:40,263
I worked to make up for it

362
00:28:41,591 --> 00:28:42,683
There are a lot more that

363
00:28:42,684 --> 00:28:43,803
I didn't tell you

364
00:28:44,621 --> 00:28:45,771
If I told you

365
00:28:45,772 --> 00:28:47,401
it's obvious how you'd have reacted

366
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,973
Mom

367
00:28:59,453 --> 00:29:00,860
Don't you understand...

368
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:03,926
what that deposit meant for us?

369
00:29:06,527 --> 00:29:07,806
After Father ended up like that

370
00:29:07,807 --> 00:29:09,138
his company ditched that money

371
00:29:09,139 --> 00:29:10,390
as a compensation

372
00:29:11,563 --> 00:29:12,690
You know well how

373
00:29:12,691 --> 00:29:13,863
we spent that money on this house...

374
00:29:14,741 --> 00:29:15,891
instead for his surgery

375
00:29:17,995 --> 00:29:20,304
If only we paid for his surgery

376
00:29:20,457 --> 00:29:21,832
he would've been able

377
00:29:21,833 --> 00:29:23,221
to get up on his legs

378
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:24,580
I know

379
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,623
You think...

380
00:29:27,029 --> 00:29:28,633
I used it because I wanted to?

381
00:29:28,896 --> 00:29:29,996
I used it because we didn't have any money

382
00:29:29,997 --> 00:29:31,788
Why don't we have any money?

383
00:29:32,777 --> 00:29:34,130
I gave you the money!

384
00:29:34,627 --> 00:29:35,986
How could you use the deposit?

385
00:29:35,987 --> 00:29:37,010
You should've asked me

386
00:29:37,011 --> 00:29:38,374
for more money instead

387
00:29:38,375 --> 00:29:39,403
Dogeon!

388
00:29:39,988 --> 00:29:41,397
I know what you think

389
00:29:41,704 --> 00:29:42,766
But I didn't

390
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:44,443
use that money for myself!

391
00:29:49,384 --> 00:29:50,940
So we don't have anything left?

392
00:29:53,775 --> 00:29:54,936
This trashy furniture is

393
00:29:54,937 --> 00:29:55,959
all we have left?

394
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:02,999
Mom

395
00:30:04,763 --> 00:30:05,803
Let's just...

396
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:08,745
go to our aunt and...

397
00:30:09,455 --> 00:30:10,683
We're not going to your aunt

398
00:30:11,111 --> 00:30:12,805
They don't help us one bit

399
00:30:12,806 --> 00:30:14,541
but they go around

400
00:30:14,542 --> 00:30:15,542
showing off every country

401
00:30:15,543 --> 00:30:16,707
they've been to

402
00:30:21,488 --> 00:30:22,656
What do you want to do then?

403
00:30:25,088 --> 00:30:26,088
When they come to destroy this house,

404
00:30:26,089 --> 00:30:27,621
shall we all die under the rubble

405
00:30:27,622 --> 00:30:29,021
in our sleep?

406
00:30:40,085 --> 00:30:41,868
The student you're tutoring

407
00:30:42,038 --> 00:30:43,291
You said he's rich

408
00:30:44,257 --> 00:30:45,551
Can't you ask

409
00:30:45,803 --> 00:30:47,355
his parents to pay you

410
00:30:47,356 --> 00:30:48,395
in advance?

411
00:30:48,775 --> 00:30:50,941
Everything will be paid with
your wage anyway

412
00:30:53,872 --> 00:30:54,908
So it's me again

413
00:30:56,987 --> 00:30:58,587
- Huh?
- It's me

414
00:30:59,998 --> 00:31:01,017
Isn't it?

415
00:31:03,789 --> 00:31:04,841
It all boils down to me

416
00:31:06,996 --> 00:31:08,005
Of course

417
00:31:11,488 --> 00:31:12,491
Mom

418
00:31:14,475 --> 00:31:15,570
Don't you ever...

419
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:18,006
feel sorry for me?

420
00:31:19,825 --> 00:31:20,985
Don't you feel bad for me?

421
00:31:23,217 --> 00:31:25,552
Everyone else feels sorry for me...

422
00:31:27,241 --> 00:31:28,381
but why is my hard work

423
00:31:28,382 --> 00:31:30,414
taken for granted by my own family?

424
00:31:30,867 --> 00:31:32,836
- Who would...
- Why do I have to live like this?

425
00:31:35,607 --> 00:31:37,729
If we live in destitute to save money...

426
00:31:38,805 --> 00:31:40,266
even discharging Dad from the hospital,

427
00:31:40,584 --> 00:31:42,639
will it be ok later on?
You really believe so?

428
00:31:42,962 --> 00:31:45,313
Is there ever an end to it?

429
00:34:14,415 --> 00:34:15,487
Mom

430
00:34:18,817 --> 00:34:19,826
Yes?

431
00:34:20,875 --> 00:34:21,920
Are you feeling uncomfortable?

432
00:34:24,712 --> 00:34:25,971
Want to go to the restroom?

433
00:34:30,645 --> 00:34:31,648
Mom

434
00:34:32,358 --> 00:34:33,496
Can I talk to Cein

435
00:34:33,498 --> 00:34:35,457
over the phone just once? Please?

436
00:34:36,096 --> 00:34:37,161
Just once

437
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:39,871
I said you can't

438
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:43,396
I'm sure he was surprised, too

439
00:34:43,841 --> 00:34:45,130
He's not as tough as he looks

440
00:34:46,666 --> 00:34:47,701
Mom

441
00:34:49,601 --> 00:34:51,441
You can't see him anyway

442
00:34:53,362 --> 00:34:54,420
Why?

443
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,232
Why can't I see him?

444
00:34:58,013 --> 00:34:59,565
He will either be asked to...

445
00:35:00,948 --> 00:35:02,187
transfer school...

446
00:35:02,768 --> 00:35:04,128
or be expelled during the Deliberation

447
00:35:05,783 --> 00:35:08,404
Your dad strongly protested that

448
00:35:08,405 --> 00:35:10,425
he can't let you go to the same school

449
00:35:10,707 --> 00:35:12,578
with someone like him

450
00:35:17,082 --> 00:35:18,104
Mom

451
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:21,688
It's not Cein...

452
00:35:25,268 --> 00:35:26,910
who called me out...

453
00:35:28,089 --> 00:35:29,239
to that place

454
00:35:31,037 --> 00:35:33,111
- Mingook...
- I know

455
00:35:37,548 --> 00:35:38,595
Mom

456
00:35:39,807 --> 00:35:40,986
You knew?

457
00:35:42,479 --> 00:35:44,255
But why...

458
00:35:47,163 --> 00:35:48,195
Jeha

459
00:35:50,207 --> 00:35:52,079
We need Mingook more than him

460
00:35:54,199 --> 00:35:55,327
These days, Mingook can't even

461
00:35:55,328 --> 00:35:56,971
meet your eyes

462
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,252
He used to be so anxious

463
00:35:59,253 --> 00:36:00,382
to get at us

464
00:36:01,727 --> 00:36:02,880
But from now on...

465
00:36:03,734 --> 00:36:05,112
he can't get at you

466
00:36:06,973 --> 00:36:08,034
And...

467
00:36:09,223 --> 00:36:10,446
whatever the reason...

468
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:12,752
it's Cein who struck you

469
00:36:22,386 --> 00:36:23,405
My son

470
00:36:25,708 --> 00:36:27,926
You're all I've got

471
00:36:29,283 --> 00:36:30,912
You said you'd protect me

472
00:36:33,455 --> 00:36:34,893
This is our house...

473
00:36:36,318 --> 00:36:37,492
and our family...

474
00:36:39,129 --> 00:36:40,184
ok?

475
00:36:56,856 --> 00:36:57,922
Dogeon

476
00:37:11,317 --> 00:37:12,331
I didn't know you were up there

477
00:37:12,907 --> 00:37:14,302
- You weren't answering your phone
- Jooan

478
00:37:17,197 --> 00:37:18,344
For today...

479
00:37:20,774 --> 00:37:21,909
just leave me alone

480
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,339
What? I can't hear you

481
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:28,554
I said, "Leave"

482
00:37:30,053 --> 00:37:31,097
Please

483
00:37:34,831 --> 00:37:36,119
Come on

484
00:37:37,331 --> 00:37:38,401
If I go back home

485
00:37:38,402 --> 00:37:39,881
my dad won't let me out

486
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:41,305
because he's scared to be alone

487
00:37:41,707 --> 00:37:43,502
He's getting worse

488
00:37:43,503 --> 00:37:45,389
Even just now, I told him I'm going out

489
00:37:45,502 --> 00:37:47,471
and he threw a frame at me

490
00:37:47,799 --> 00:37:48,851
So what?

491
00:37:50,558 --> 00:37:52,477
What do you want me to do?

492
00:37:55,977 --> 00:37:56,992
Huh?

493
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,399
What's going on?

494
00:38:02,023 --> 00:38:03,102
Did something happen to you?

495
00:38:03,395 --> 00:38:04,440
What's wrong?

496
00:38:04,595 --> 00:38:05,670
Stop asking me

497
00:38:05,671 --> 00:38:06,635
I also don't know

498
00:38:06,636 --> 00:38:07,647
I also don't know

499
00:38:07,648 --> 00:38:08,822
what I should do!

500
00:38:16,112 --> 00:38:17,142
I'm sorry

501
00:38:18,364 --> 00:38:19,975
So please, just leave

502
00:38:22,926 --> 00:38:24,122
What happened?

503
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:26,476
Darn it

504
00:38:26,769 --> 00:38:28,446
Dohyeon got into trouble again, didn't he?

505
00:38:28,939 --> 00:38:30,210
Tell me, Dogeon

506
00:38:33,174 --> 00:38:34,929
There's a lot going on even without him

507
00:38:38,845 --> 00:38:39,852
What if I told you?

508
00:38:41,943 --> 00:38:43,309
Can you fix it for me?

509
00:38:48,043 --> 00:38:50,123
- Come on, Dogeon
- The only thing you can do

510
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:52,290
is talking about yourself

511
00:38:55,485 --> 00:38:56,834
Whenever there's trouble

512
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:58,593
you feel better after pouring it
out on me, right?

513
00:39:00,025 --> 00:39:01,371
After you're gone

514
00:39:01,618 --> 00:39:02,891
I feel crushed

515
00:39:02,892 --> 00:39:04,583
even under a thin blanket

516
00:39:04,772 --> 00:39:05,802
Who should I

517
00:39:05,803 --> 00:39:06,920
confide in?

518
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,315
Why isn't there anyone by my side?

519
00:39:08,316 --> 00:39:09,604
Why should I live like this?

520
00:39:09,605 --> 00:39:10,679
I just want to evaporate

521
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,030
into thin air

522
00:39:21,186 --> 00:39:23,464
Dogeon

523
00:39:25,847 --> 00:39:27,067
Do you know what I hate

524
00:39:27,068 --> 00:39:28,095
the most about myself?

525
00:39:30,021 --> 00:39:32,136
I get used to things, whatever that is

526
00:39:32,837 --> 00:39:34,440
I give up and don't even fight on

527
00:39:34,441 --> 00:39:35,527
No...

528
00:39:35,794 --> 00:39:37,337
I don't even want to fight

529
00:39:38,862 --> 00:39:40,390
I see you pouring out your anger

530
00:39:40,391 --> 00:39:41,466
and I get vicarious pleasure

531
00:39:42,525 --> 00:39:43,624
After that, I grill you

532
00:39:43,625 --> 00:39:44,677
not to do that...

533
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:46,429
and even rationalize myself

534
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:47,488
that I'm right

535
00:39:47,489 --> 00:39:48,575
That's who I am

536
00:39:48,878 --> 00:39:51,521
I'm a despicable coward

537
00:39:54,765 --> 00:39:56,471
So what am I to console others?

538
00:39:57,525 --> 00:39:59,579
How could I understand other people?

539
00:40:06,796 --> 00:40:07,998
Shoot

540
00:40:10,346 --> 00:40:12,500
I didn't know
you were having such a hard time

541
00:40:15,909 --> 00:40:18,917
You should've told me a long time ago

542
00:40:29,997 --> 00:40:31,116
Thanks...

543
00:40:34,225 --> 00:40:35,487
for hearing me out...

544
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:37,189
all this time...

545
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:43,390
and I'm sorry

546
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:10,688
Haru, Haru Park

547
00:41:12,755 --> 00:41:13,781
It's him again

548
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:15,879
He's not real. He doesn't exist

549
00:41:19,293 --> 00:41:20,861
Haru Park

550
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,499
Good morning, Oneday

551
00:41:28,343 --> 00:41:29,433
Yeah, Hosu

552
00:41:30,118 --> 00:41:31,209
Did you have breakfast?

553
00:41:32,265 --> 00:41:33,845
- No
- Really?

554
00:41:35,676 --> 00:41:37,670
You look more handsome today

555
00:41:40,197 --> 00:41:41,204
Oh, right. Haru

556
00:41:41,428 --> 00:41:43,566
There's someone I want to introduce

557
00:41:45,686 --> 00:41:47,301
To introduce to me?

558
00:41:47,844 --> 00:41:48,865
Who is it?

559
00:41:49,476 --> 00:41:50,822
You have to meet him

560
00:42:05,544 --> 00:42:08,205
I took out my savings for you here

561
00:42:11,827 --> 00:42:13,384
Our Oneday

562
00:42:13,735 --> 00:42:15,899
If you keep drinking
the milk I give you...

563
00:42:16,809 --> 00:42:18,109
you'll grow up to three meters

564
00:42:23,217 --> 00:42:24,280
Were you...

565
00:42:25,492 --> 00:42:26,504
upset with me?

566
00:42:28,481 --> 00:42:29,517
Well

567
00:42:29,884 --> 00:42:31,708
I was a little busy lately

568
00:42:33,667 --> 00:42:35,363
The care period is ending soon...

569
00:42:36,473 --> 00:42:37,949
but to get into a support facility...

570
00:42:38,656 --> 00:42:40,876
I must have a job or a certificate

571
00:42:42,225 --> 00:42:43,482
I can bear it if I get hungry

572
00:42:43,483 --> 00:42:45,109
or if I don't have enough clothes...

573
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:47,894
but to imagine
having no roof over my head...

574
00:42:48,549 --> 00:42:51,445
even a super ultra positive guy like me...

575
00:42:52,436 --> 00:42:53,781
got impatient

576
00:42:58,323 --> 00:42:59,358
So...

577
00:43:01,701 --> 00:43:02,753
even when I knew

578
00:43:02,754 --> 00:43:04,337
how much you liked me

579
00:43:04,338 --> 00:43:05,691
I couldn't look out for you

580
00:43:08,093 --> 00:43:09,141
I admit it

581
00:43:13,034 --> 00:43:14,077
So...

582
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:18,416
you got upset and
got yourself a new friend?

583
00:43:21,364 --> 00:43:22,471
New friend?

584
00:43:23,792 --> 00:43:25,127
It's ok. Jooan never

585
00:43:25,128 --> 00:43:26,335
wanted to tell me...

586
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:28,364
but I begged him for days

587
00:43:28,365 --> 00:43:29,630
That's how I found out

588
00:43:31,789 --> 00:43:33,064
Anything about you...

589
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:35,752
I want to be the first to know

590
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:43,266
If that friend

591
00:43:43,267 --> 00:43:44,946
were a source of strength to you...

592
00:43:45,688 --> 00:43:47,261
I don't think it's something bad

593
00:43:48,656 --> 00:43:49,779
Everyone

594
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:50,822
needs

595
00:43:50,823 --> 00:43:51,827
a listening ear

596
00:43:54,203 --> 00:43:56,314
I'll be that person from now on

597
00:43:58,513 --> 00:43:59,598
So you can...

598
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:02,092
tell him to go

599
00:44:05,125 --> 00:44:06,138
I...

600
00:44:10,712 --> 00:44:12,230
I also want to do that

601
00:44:26,222 --> 00:44:27,249
I guess he still

602
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:28,567
has something to tell you

603
00:44:31,701 --> 00:44:33,282
Do you still see him?

604
00:44:46,753 --> 00:44:48,401
I said leave! It's not you!

605
00:44:48,402 --> 00:44:49,845
I don't need you!

606
00:44:51,637 --> 00:44:52,654
Haru

607
00:44:52,754 --> 00:44:53,841
Haru Park

608
00:44:55,490 --> 00:44:56,500
Look at me

609
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:58,488
Look at me

610
00:44:58,489 --> 00:44:59,525
Look only at me

611
00:45:02,803 --> 00:45:03,880
You see me, right?

612
00:45:05,123 --> 00:45:06,177
Right?

613
00:45:12,044 --> 00:45:13,052
Are you real?

614
00:45:16,027 --> 00:45:17,103
What?

615
00:45:22,362 --> 00:45:24,486
Are you real?

616
00:45:28,815 --> 00:45:30,365
I hope you are real...

617
00:45:33,805 --> 00:45:34,811
out of all people

618
00:45:39,438 --> 00:45:40,439
Yes

619
00:45:43,027 --> 00:45:44,098
I'm real

620
00:45:46,648 --> 00:45:48,641
I won't leave you even if you asked me to

621
00:45:49,308 --> 00:45:50,337
I won't disappear

622
00:45:51,107 --> 00:45:52,199
No...

623
00:45:54,439 --> 00:45:55,484
I can't disappear

624
00:46:00,498 --> 00:46:02,361
The person you mentioned...

625
00:46:07,384 --> 00:46:08,926
Is he real, too?

626
00:46:18,187 --> 00:46:20,235
Are you real?

627
00:46:47,652 --> 00:46:49,160
I hope you are real...

628
00:46:50,134 --> 00:46:51,320
out of all people

629
00:47:19,724 --> 00:47:21,068
It's no use!

630
00:47:21,682 --> 00:47:22,794
Mr. Min

631
00:47:23,233 --> 00:47:25,268
You should've educated your son first

632
00:47:25,521 --> 00:47:27,874
before bringing these petty gifts

633
00:47:31,662 --> 00:47:32,760
Yes

634
00:47:33,403 --> 00:47:34,491
Due to my shortcoming

635
00:47:34,994 --> 00:47:36,558
I couldn't keep my son at bay

636
00:47:38,052 --> 00:47:39,186
As you wished...

637
00:47:39,927 --> 00:47:41,120
we'll move to a different area...

638
00:47:42,262 --> 00:47:43,396
and transfer school

639
00:47:44,851 --> 00:47:45,970
Never again...

640
00:47:47,288 --> 00:47:48,337
we'll be in the vicinity

641
00:47:48,338 --> 00:47:49,584
of your sons

642
00:47:50,193 --> 00:47:51,855
So please don't let it

643
00:47:51,856 --> 00:47:53,004
escalate to a criminal case

644
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:58,618
I beg you

645
00:48:33,048 --> 00:48:34,228
Hyunjoong Kim

646
00:48:34,534 --> 00:48:36,297
Put away your book

647
00:48:38,312 --> 00:48:39,828
You know what happens if
you're caught cheating, right?

648
00:48:41,866 --> 00:48:43,588
I heard it's the start of
your midterm exam

649
00:48:45,382 --> 00:48:46,386
Yes

650
00:48:48,034 --> 00:48:49,732
Can I look forward to your grades again?

651
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:59,493
Sir, I believe you're aware

652
00:48:59,494 --> 00:49:00,623
but the Deliberation Committee's today

653
00:49:03,757 --> 00:49:05,044
I already have a lot on my plate

654
00:49:05,045 --> 00:49:06,972
but was forced into being
the committee chairman

655
00:49:10,393 --> 00:49:11,492
I heard it roughly that

656
00:49:11,493 --> 00:49:12,787
he hit the boy's head with a stone

657
00:49:14,183 --> 00:49:16,121
That will be a straight out expulsion

658
00:49:17,608 --> 00:49:19,360
The house that caught fire

659
00:49:20,035 --> 00:49:21,116
I heard he's the son

660
00:49:21,758 --> 00:49:23,322
His mom died during that incident, right?

661
00:49:23,878 --> 00:49:24,949
Yes, well

662
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:26,638
there was a rumor that

663
00:49:26,639 --> 00:49:27,977
he killed his mother

664
00:49:28,796 --> 00:49:30,688
Even for the beach incident...

665
00:49:31,642 --> 00:49:32,795
whenever something comes up

666
00:49:32,796 --> 00:49:33,822
he gets

667
00:49:33,823 --> 00:49:34,864
the most suspicion

668
00:49:35,443 --> 00:49:36,877
I don't know
how he held out without moving

669
00:49:38,667 --> 00:49:39,700
Why is he still staying here

670
00:49:39,701 --> 00:49:40,842
after all that fuss?

671
00:49:41,821 --> 00:49:43,862
Well, I'm not sure

672
00:49:45,759 --> 00:49:47,038
Sir, I thought

673
00:49:47,039 --> 00:49:48,188
it over

674
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:51,468
Instead of expelling him

675
00:49:51,469 --> 00:49:53,146
how about transferring him
to another school?

676
00:49:53,825 --> 00:49:55,181
From others' perspectives...

677
00:49:55,653 --> 00:49:57,124
you are showing consideration

678
00:49:57,125 --> 00:49:58,490
to both the perpetrator and the victim

679
00:49:58,975 --> 00:50:00,317
and it'd look more positive

680
00:50:03,763 --> 00:50:05,987
What do you think, Hwan? Your friend...

681
00:50:07,686 --> 00:50:08,842
You also know him

682
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:14,847
Well

683
00:50:14,848 --> 00:50:15,899
I guess both options

684
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:17,090
wouldn't be so positive for you

685
00:50:42,281 --> 00:50:44,312
Did everyone get it?

686
00:50:44,313 --> 00:50:45,574
Survey on School Violence

687
00:50:45,575 --> 00:50:47,578
This survey will be anonymous

688
00:50:47,579 --> 00:50:49,790
so please provide your honest opinions

689
00:50:50,429 --> 00:50:51,537
- Ok
- Ok

690
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:55,289
What is the appropriate measure

691
00:50:55,290 --> 00:50:56,474
for the recent school violence?

692
00:50:56,475 --> 00:50:58,718
Well, there are the detention...

693
00:50:59,622 --> 00:51:00,968
expulsion...

694
00:51:01,771 --> 00:51:02,976
and school transfer options

695
00:51:03,861 --> 00:51:05,842
There are several measures we can take

696
00:51:07,164 --> 00:51:08,168
But...

697
00:51:10,141 --> 00:51:12,362
wouldn't it be awkward

698
00:51:12,363 --> 00:51:13,872
to run into Cein

699
00:51:13,873 --> 00:51:15,313
in the neighborhood?

700
00:51:16,247 --> 00:51:18,503
Not just for Mingook or Jeha...

701
00:51:20,365 --> 00:51:21,588
but for you, too

702
00:51:25,924 --> 00:51:26,975
Ah, of course

703
00:51:27,526 --> 00:51:29,137
You two are friends for now

704
00:51:29,455 --> 00:51:30,690
so Cein...

705
00:51:31,387 --> 00:51:34,165
won't go around

706
00:51:34,408 --> 00:51:36,699
talking about your grades

707
00:51:37,148 --> 00:51:38,403
But you never know

708
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:41,326
what will happen to your friendship

709
00:51:42,988 --> 00:51:44,684
Consider your father's case

710
00:51:45,251 --> 00:51:47,374
He was so close with his friends

711
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,732
People fall apart...

712
00:51:55,565 --> 00:51:57,058
not after a fight...

713
00:51:57,768 --> 00:51:59,935
but when they're sorry to one another

714
00:52:01,136 --> 00:52:02,395
The feeling of hatred

715
00:52:02,396 --> 00:52:04,216
is a knife pointed
towards the other person...

716
00:52:05,005 --> 00:52:06,201
but the feeling of remorse

717
00:52:06,202 --> 00:52:08,252
is a knife pointed towards myself

718
00:52:13,819 --> 00:52:14,936
But still...

719
00:52:14,937 --> 00:52:17,154
Instead of expulsion, school transfer...

720
00:52:18,573 --> 00:52:19,904
will force him to move

721
00:52:19,905 --> 00:52:21,027
to another neighborhood

722
00:52:21,691 --> 00:52:23,844
Wouldn't that be more reassuring?

723
00:52:32,924 --> 00:52:34,595
Language and Media Midterm Answer Sheet

724
00:52:46,382 --> 00:52:47,891
I guess that could be better

725
00:52:49,205 --> 00:52:50,295
Sorry?

726
00:52:55,892 --> 00:52:57,325
It'd be better for Cein to transfer...

727
00:52:58,651 --> 00:52:59,705
school

728
00:53:06,468 --> 00:53:11,662
What is the appropriate measure
for the recent school violence?

729
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:47,867
4 School transfer / 5 Expulsion

730
00:54:41,773 --> 00:54:42,806
The test?

731
00:54:43,595 --> 00:54:45,938
Of course, I did well

732
00:54:48,392 --> 00:54:49,944
Mrs. Kim, I can't make it today

733
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:52,003
I promised to go

734
00:54:52,004 --> 00:54:53,206
somewhere with Haru today

735
00:54:53,207 --> 00:54:54,302
so I'll be late

736
00:54:55,946 --> 00:54:56,960
By the way, where are you going?

737
00:54:59,195 --> 00:55:00,424
Redevelopment opposition rally?

738
00:55:03,473 --> 00:55:04,536
They aren't going to redevelop

739
00:55:04,537 --> 00:55:05,651
Why would there be a rally?

740
00:55:13,644 --> 00:55:15,309
Oh, hold on. I'll call you back

741
00:55:19,330 --> 00:55:20,330
Hosu

742
00:55:24,939 --> 00:55:25,962
Oh, Haru. You're here

743
00:55:27,513 --> 00:55:28,536
I'm sorry

744
00:55:28,537 --> 00:55:29,570
There's something

745
00:55:29,571 --> 00:55:30,596
I must find out

746
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:32,150
Could you wait for me a little bit?

747
00:55:32,943 --> 00:55:33,977
You know what, you can go

748
00:55:33,978 --> 00:55:35,071
to the academy first

749
00:55:36,363 --> 00:55:37,862
Let's go together. I'll wait

750
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:39,833
Will it take long?

751
00:55:41,434 --> 00:55:43,475
I don't think it'll take long

752
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:46,153
Wait

753
00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:49,806
He's going to start his class soon

754
00:55:51,664 --> 00:55:53,400
Don't worry. He's a good person

755
00:55:54,322 --> 00:55:56,224
I told him a lot about you

756
00:55:56,419 --> 00:55:57,603
so it won't be awkward

757
00:55:57,604 --> 00:55:58,646
to meet him alone

758
00:55:59,114 --> 00:56:00,146
I promise

759
00:56:00,453 --> 00:56:01,524
You don't trust me?

760
00:56:02,088 --> 00:56:03,234
You'll come soon, right?

761
00:56:03,326 --> 00:56:05,135
I'll be there as soon as it's over

762
00:56:05,356 --> 00:56:06,712
I'll text you

763
00:56:06,713 --> 00:56:08,091
the location now

764
00:56:12,816 --> 00:56:13,885
You can go there yourself, right?

765
00:56:14,598 --> 00:56:16,551
Yeah, I can...

766
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:19,347
but come quickly

767
00:56:19,924 --> 00:56:21,310
Ok, go first

768
00:56:44,182 --> 00:56:45,243
Hello

769
00:56:46,304 --> 00:56:48,358
Did Legislator Changjun Kim...

770
00:56:48,525 --> 00:56:49,645
He just went in

771
00:57:41,017 --> 00:57:42,239
What do you believe in?

772
00:57:43,637 --> 00:57:45,609
You don't believe in superstition,
and you don't have a dream

773
00:57:47,496 --> 00:57:48,556
You really don't have any?

774
00:57:49,473 --> 00:57:51,023
Everyone talked about
their dreams except you

775
00:57:52,568 --> 00:57:53,627
I don't

776
00:57:54,615 --> 00:57:56,181
Those things are unnecessary

777
00:57:58,365 --> 00:57:59,430
I thought it over

778
00:57:59,431 --> 00:58:00,703
after listening to you guys

779
00:58:01,808 --> 00:58:02,837
And now...

780
00:58:03,598 --> 00:58:04,954
I know what I want to become

781
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:06,905
No need to hear it out.
I know it'll be bad

782
00:58:07,625 --> 00:58:08,652
It's not bad

783
00:58:09,011 --> 00:58:10,585
You'll be surprised once you hear it

784
00:58:14,003 --> 00:58:15,057
Your older brother

785
00:58:15,538 --> 00:58:16,604
My older brother?

786
00:58:17,796 --> 00:58:18,919
What do you mean?

787
00:58:20,026 --> 00:58:21,112
You wanna be my older brother?

788
00:58:21,445 --> 00:58:22,458
Yeah

789
00:58:22,923 --> 00:58:24,017
If I'm ever reborn...

790
00:58:24,488 --> 00:58:25,852
I want to be your older brother

791
00:58:26,383 --> 00:58:27,461
Ah

792
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:28,911
After you're reborn

793
00:58:28,912 --> 00:58:30,591
you wanna get at me
rightfully as the brother?

794
00:58:31,076 --> 00:58:32,141
No

795
00:58:33,388 --> 00:58:34,862
I love that I have you...

796
00:58:35,554 --> 00:58:36,663
but you don't have
anyone to look after you

797
00:58:37,723 --> 00:58:39,060
So when I'm reborn...

798
00:58:39,666 --> 00:58:40,670
I want to be

799
00:58:40,671 --> 00:58:41,710
the brother figure for you

800
00:58:43,037 --> 00:58:44,303
So whenever you're going through something

801
00:58:44,304 --> 00:58:45,387
I'll help you out

802
00:58:46,041 --> 00:58:47,020
What do you think?

803
00:58:47,882 --> 00:58:48,892
Guess how many times

804
00:58:48,893 --> 00:58:50,709
I mentioned "brother" just now?

805
01:00:01,774 --> 01:00:02,801
Haru...

806
01:00:06,627 --> 01:00:07,773
Oh, it's raining

807
01:00:13,088 --> 01:00:14,634
Sir, thank you for your hard work

808
01:00:16,006 --> 01:00:17,061
Excuse me, sir

809
01:00:20,794 --> 01:00:21,850
Hello

810
01:00:21,959 --> 01:00:23,674
I don't know whether you remember

811
01:00:23,901 --> 01:00:25,795
but I'm Hwan's friend, Hosu Jeong

812
01:00:27,863 --> 01:00:29,723
May I know what will happen to Cein...

813
01:00:29,888 --> 01:00:31,820
You will find out

814
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:34,499
- in a few days...
- It's alright

815
01:00:34,885 --> 01:00:36,651
He waited because he was worried

816
01:00:42,724 --> 01:00:43,832
We made our decision after thoroughly

817
01:00:43,833 --> 01:00:45,780
looking into
the perpetrator's situation...

818
01:00:46,395 --> 01:00:47,462
so don't worry too much

819
01:00:48,751 --> 01:00:49,884
You'll find out the disposition...

820
01:00:50,445 --> 01:00:51,841
through the school announcement

821
01:00:54,266 --> 01:00:55,373
And there's one more...

822
01:00:59,482 --> 01:01:00,612
I mean...

823
01:01:01,605 --> 01:01:02,817
Actually

824
01:01:02,944 --> 01:01:05,069
I live in the orphanage in District 2

825
01:01:05,717 --> 01:01:07,807
There are a lot of kids like me

826
01:01:08,888 --> 01:01:10,617
If that area gets redeveloped

827
01:01:10,686 --> 01:01:11,707
those kids need to

828
01:01:11,708 --> 01:01:12,884
be split up

829
01:01:14,632 --> 01:01:15,780
So...

830
01:01:16,538 --> 01:01:17,940
I know you've said you won't

831
01:01:17,941 --> 01:01:19,727
redevelop during the election...

832
01:01:20,801 --> 01:01:22,914
but the mood isn't so optimistic

833
01:01:24,617 --> 01:01:26,262
I'm old enough to leave the orphanage

834
01:01:26,263 --> 01:01:27,423
so it's not a problem for me...

835
01:01:28,638 --> 01:01:29,677
but for younger kids...

836
01:01:29,678 --> 01:01:31,118
I am already working on

837
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:33,123
the Children Leaving Act for
juveniles over the age of 19

838
01:01:33,531 --> 01:01:35,817
and shelter-related laws

839
01:01:37,161 --> 01:01:38,936
So please wait it out

840
01:01:39,447 --> 01:01:41,036
I'm really grateful for that...

841
01:01:43,099 --> 01:01:44,379
but Songjoo...

842
01:01:45,797 --> 01:01:47,283
won't be redeveloped, will it?

843
01:02:05,145 --> 01:02:06,641
Sir!

844
01:02:06,642 --> 01:02:07,668
Cut it out

845
01:04:28,822 --> 01:04:30,160
I knew we'll meet again

846
01:04:34,931 --> 01:04:36,883
First grade class seven,
Cheongyun Elementary School

847
01:04:37,615 --> 01:04:38,664
Haru Park

848
01:05:14,759 --> 01:05:15,812
Run

849
01:05:18,422 --> 01:05:21,848
Grass Flower Arboretum

850
01:06:07,389 --> 01:06:08,409
Haru

851
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:10,859
Are you ok?

852
01:06:19,522 --> 01:06:21,269
Let's run away again

853
01:06:22,059 --> 01:06:24,147
You can't win this, and you know it

854
01:06:37,215 --> 01:06:38,832
We can hide better this time

855
01:06:39,668 --> 01:06:42,106
A place where
you'll never meet that monster

856
01:06:43,815 --> 01:06:45,109
There will be such a place somewhere

857
01:06:46,909 --> 01:06:47,925
No...

858
01:06:50,043 --> 01:06:51,054
there isn't...

859
01:06:52,125 --> 01:06:53,459
unless I die

860
01:06:54,939 --> 01:06:56,032
Isn't surviving...

861
01:06:57,656 --> 01:06:58,775
exhausting?

862
01:07:00,980 --> 01:07:02,498
You also said it's hard

863
01:07:03,908 --> 01:07:05,257
You want to rest, too

864
01:07:08,490 --> 01:07:09,490
No

865
01:07:11,691 --> 01:07:12,819
I want to live

866
01:07:15,795 --> 01:07:17,701
People might think it'd be better

867
01:07:17,702 --> 01:07:19,042
to die than to live like this

868
01:07:24,052 --> 01:07:25,733
But no, I want to live so badly

869
01:07:28,754 --> 01:07:30,649
Even if it pains every day, I want to live

870
01:07:32,711 --> 01:07:33,730
So...

871
01:07:38,234 --> 01:07:39,275
you die

872
01:07:41,731 --> 01:07:42,792
I will live

873
01:07:49,943 --> 01:07:51,965
I'll kill that monster...

874
01:07:54,786 --> 01:07:55,844
and I'll live
