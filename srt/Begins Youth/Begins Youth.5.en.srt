00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:04,300
This series is based on a fictionalized story inspired by the story of BTS's album,
The Most Beautiful Moment in Life,
and is not related to BTS members and their families.

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,300
Child actors and animals were filmed
in safe conditions under the supervision of their guardians.

3
00:00:14,952 --> 00:00:20,913
Naeri Gas Station

4
00:00:57,687 --> 00:00:58,856
I know the money's deposited

5
00:00:59,677 --> 00:01:00,826
But...

6
00:01:03,205 --> 00:01:04,641
this won't be dangerous, right?

7
00:01:11,484 --> 00:01:13,096
Piano
Academy

8
00:01:13,097 --> 00:01:14,117
Fine

9
00:01:15,639 --> 00:01:16,850
I left it near the house

10
00:01:20,183 --> 00:01:21,381
I'm going to stop here

11
00:01:22,403 --> 00:01:23,596
I can't do it anymore

12
00:01:26,413 --> 00:01:27,496
Yes

13
00:02:43,511 --> 00:02:47,032
Songjoo Police Station
Friendly People's Police

14
00:03:02,316 --> 00:03:03,364
Dogeon

15
00:03:04,198 --> 00:03:05,265
What's going on?

16
00:03:06,663 --> 00:03:08,557
I came here without telling my parents...

17
00:03:10,306 --> 00:03:11,540
So we...

18
00:03:12,836 --> 00:03:15,553
goofed around oblivious of the dead body?

19
00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:28,235
Police Line Do Not Cross

20
00:03:30,049 --> 00:03:32,095
Well, guys

21
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:35,764
You must be surprised
after getting the call

22
00:03:36,241 --> 00:03:37,745
but don't worry too much

23
00:03:38,567 --> 00:03:40,537
We only called to ask some questions

24
00:03:44,723 --> 00:03:46,334
Who is Cein Min?

25
00:03:49,704 --> 00:03:51,425
- That's me
- Ok

26
00:03:52,069 --> 00:03:53,278
Cein Min

27
00:03:58,332 --> 00:03:59,546
Dogeon Kim?

28
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,438
I'm here

29
00:04:02,483 --> 00:04:03,721
Jooan Kim

30
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,138
That's me

31
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:09,716
- Hosu Jeong
- Yes

32
00:04:10,877 --> 00:04:12,957
- Hwan Kim
- Yes

33
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,582
So you must be Jeha Jeon

34
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:17,542
Yes

35
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:23,825
Haru Park is in a psychiatric ward

36
00:04:24,233 --> 00:04:25,662
so I guess everyone's here

37
00:04:25,664 --> 00:04:27,277
Please wait here for a second

38
00:04:27,732 --> 00:04:29,298
Just relax and wait here

39
00:04:45,276 --> 00:04:46,660
We were just swimming...

40
00:04:48,507 --> 00:04:49,867
with the fire on

41
00:04:52,086 --> 00:04:53,266
That's it

42
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,669
What does my kid have to do with the case?

43
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,645
It's not that he's relevant to the case

44
00:05:03,457 --> 00:05:06,783
We got a tip from a witness

45
00:05:06,784 --> 00:05:07,841
so I'm just here to check

46
00:05:09,787 --> 00:05:11,149
Tip from a witness?

47
00:05:11,799 --> 00:05:13,009
What's that about?

48
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:14,190
Ah, well...

49
00:05:14,768 --> 00:05:17,175
The owner of the sashimi restaurant
near the beach reported

50
00:05:17,176 --> 00:05:18,722
that your son and his friends

51
00:05:18,723 --> 00:05:20,576
were playing until late at night

52
00:05:22,854 --> 00:05:24,666
How would he have known?

53
00:05:25,232 --> 00:05:27,982
Who would've imagined
a dead body on the beach?

54
00:05:30,534 --> 00:05:33,251
- Do you know how shocked he was?
- Ma'am

55
00:05:34,027 --> 00:05:36,153
It's just an inquiry,
so no need to get worked up

56
00:05:37,007 --> 00:05:39,892
May I ask, what are you being treated for?

57
00:05:40,372 --> 00:05:41,544
What are your symptoms?

58
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,058
Do we need to answer that?

59
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:51,673
Do you know how hurtful
those questions can be?

60
00:05:52,246 --> 00:05:53,558
- I was just...
- What?

61
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,303
Do you think my kid is like
those mental patients on the news?

62
00:05:58,394 --> 00:06:02,801
Would you have asked that
if he were suffering a heart disease?

63
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:07,973
Do you know how hard it is
when we're treated this way?

64
00:06:09,548 --> 00:06:11,032
Those inconsiderate questions...

65
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,572
are harder to deal with
than the illness itself

66
00:06:15,339 --> 00:06:17,413
Okay, I understand

67
00:06:17,926 --> 00:06:20,827
We might have further questions...

68
00:06:21,495 --> 00:06:22,616
so please cooperate with us

69
00:06:24,249 --> 00:06:25,453
Hope you get well treated

70
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:40,045
I told you not to hang out with them

71
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:44,929
I'm sorry

72
00:06:47,729 --> 00:06:50,199
How much more should I care for you?

73
00:06:54,178 --> 00:06:55,473
You're wearing me...

74
00:06:56,073 --> 00:06:57,105
out

75
00:07:20,901 --> 00:07:22,244
Something came up...

76
00:07:24,743 --> 00:07:26,389
Yes, I'm sorry

77
00:07:28,305 --> 00:07:31,701
I wanted to call the car owner,
but I couldn't reach...

78
00:07:32,976 --> 00:07:33,991
Hello?

79
00:07:34,668 --> 00:07:35,728
Hello...

80
00:07:44,995 --> 00:07:46,701
We were just playing on the beach

81
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,666
Why do we have to get questioned?

82
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,093
It's because of me again

83
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,652
It's not because of you

84
00:07:55,751 --> 00:07:57,585
We're just unlucky

85
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,128
Hello

86
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:13,238
Please

87
00:08:31,491 --> 00:08:32,759
Why did you go to the beach?

88
00:08:33,268 --> 00:08:37,258
We wanted to hang out
since it's the vacation

89
00:08:38,436 --> 00:08:39,803
That's why we went there

90
00:08:41,217 --> 00:08:42,605
What did you do at the beach?

91
00:08:45,403 --> 00:08:48,428
Don't people normally swim in the water?

92
00:08:50,728 --> 00:08:52,742
We swam...

93
00:08:54,927 --> 00:08:56,132
and fooled around

94
00:08:57,632 --> 00:08:59,295
You started a fire there

95
00:08:59,702 --> 00:09:01,157
Didn't you know
you can't start a fire there?

96
00:09:03,207 --> 00:09:04,608
It was getting dark and cold

97
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:07,192
How did you start the fire?

98
00:09:09,793 --> 00:09:11,902
- With what?
- With my lighter

99
00:09:12,967 --> 00:09:14,109
Lighter?

100
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,681
Why would you carry a lighter?

101
00:09:22,439 --> 00:09:23,875
I just carry it...

102
00:09:26,076 --> 00:09:27,410
What did you guys burn?

103
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:32,841
We collected some woods here and there

104
00:09:35,022 --> 00:09:37,023
We didn't do anything

105
00:09:40,281 --> 00:09:41,676
I'm telling the truth

106
00:09:43,384 --> 00:09:44,513
That's it?

107
00:09:45,312 --> 00:09:46,412
Yes

108
00:09:48,105 --> 00:09:50,997
I did tell you this earlier...

109
00:09:52,589 --> 00:09:56,411
I'm glad to meet you thanks to your son

110
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:01,727
The body that was found on the beach...

111
00:10:02,424 --> 00:10:05,659
He's from the neighborhood.
His name's Wonjoong Byeon

112
00:10:06,369 --> 00:10:08,126
He used to go to Songjoo Jeil High

113
00:10:08,127 --> 00:10:10,348
He worked briefly for
the Scholarship Foundation

114
00:10:10,349 --> 00:10:12,535
He was struggling mentally
and getting treated

115
00:10:13,241 --> 00:10:14,306
Oh, is that so?

116
00:10:16,479 --> 00:10:18,874
What was... his name again?

117
00:10:19,457 --> 00:10:20,650
Wonjoong Byeon?

118
00:10:21,876 --> 00:10:23,878
Is he the guy?

119
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:25,279
Have you ever seen him?

120
00:10:26,188 --> 00:10:27,665
He was in the neighborhood for a few days

121
00:10:36,251 --> 00:10:37,453
I'm sorry

122
00:10:44,425 --> 00:10:46,661
Um, did he...

123
00:10:47,983 --> 00:10:52,214
have black bruises
between his thumb and index?

124
00:10:52,591 --> 00:10:53,730
Bruises?

125
00:10:55,834 --> 00:11:01,589
Crime scene photos

126
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:02,788
You're right

127
00:11:05,465 --> 00:11:06,565
Ever seen him?

128
00:11:09,143 --> 00:11:10,201
I...

129
00:11:12,476 --> 00:11:13,979
I went to Jooan's house...

130
00:11:14,671 --> 00:11:17,378
and ran into him in front of the apartment

131
00:11:19,274 --> 00:11:20,503
My house?

132
00:11:21,571 --> 00:11:23,683
My house when? why?

133
00:11:24,173 --> 00:11:25,606
You just ran into him?

134
00:11:25,607 --> 00:11:26,990
Did you ever talk to him?

135
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:30,405
No, I just bumped into him

136
00:11:33,888 --> 00:11:35,508
- Detective Park
- Yes

137
00:11:35,509 --> 00:11:39,420
Wonjoong Byeon went to
Jooan Kim's apartment

138
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,988
We should check for other witnesses

139
00:11:42,331 --> 00:11:43,467
Yes, sir

140
00:11:44,754 --> 00:11:46,238
Why aren't they letting us go?

141
00:11:54,803 --> 00:11:56,485
Are we going into that cell, too?

142
00:11:59,698 --> 00:12:01,624
Only when you've done something wrong

143
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:02,824
We didn't do anything wrong

144
00:12:04,431 --> 00:12:05,828
It'll be over soon

145
00:12:07,234 --> 00:12:08,391
Don't worry

146
00:12:10,088 --> 00:12:11,787
I'm Jeha's mother

147
00:12:16,878 --> 00:12:18,104
Jeha!

148
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:21,310
Are you alright?

149
00:12:23,128 --> 00:12:24,575
He's still a minor!

150
00:12:24,576 --> 00:12:27,614
Is it legal to interrogate
without parental consent?

151
00:12:27,615 --> 00:12:28,907
Ma'am, it's nothing serious

152
00:12:28,908 --> 00:12:30,807
We just asked simple questions

153
00:12:32,206 --> 00:12:34,666
- Oh, we've met before, didn't we?
- Yes

154
00:12:34,667 --> 00:12:36,966
- Appreciate your service
- Thank you

155
00:12:37,328 --> 00:12:38,557
Well...

156
00:12:45,917 --> 00:12:47,822
- How's everything?
- It's fine

157
00:12:54,069 --> 00:12:55,798
What's the story behind the bike?

158
00:12:57,798 --> 00:13:00,200
They stole it first

159
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:07,191
Why is there a rumor of you
threatening with a knife?

160
00:13:10,186 --> 00:13:11,569
I don't know

161
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:16,444
You were investigated in the past...

162
00:13:18,438 --> 00:13:20,706
regarding a death
from a house fire, right?

163
00:13:20,707 --> 00:13:21,757
That case's...

164
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:25,167
already closed without any charges

165
00:13:26,155 --> 00:13:29,075
We're just the bereaved, including my son

166
00:13:30,274 --> 00:13:32,225
Oh, okay

167
00:13:44,468 --> 00:13:46,861
You can go now

168
00:13:49,107 --> 00:13:50,144
Thanks for your time

169
00:13:58,445 --> 00:13:59,625
Let's go

170
00:14:12,597 --> 00:14:15,200
Right, off you go

171
00:14:15,804 --> 00:14:17,385
It'll be our turn soon enough

172
00:14:21,732 --> 00:14:23,304
Your ear, does it hurt?

173
00:14:25,202 --> 00:14:26,377
No

174
00:14:27,057 --> 00:14:30,348
It doesn't hurt, but it feels weird
when I think about...

175
00:14:31,548 --> 00:14:33,024
my ear not working

176
00:14:38,924 --> 00:14:42,447
I'm sorry. You must be really busy

177
00:14:42,747 --> 00:14:45,263
It's all my fault

178
00:14:46,063 --> 00:14:48,006
You have nothing to worry about

179
00:14:48,424 --> 00:14:50,726
- You can take him now
- Ah, yes

180
00:14:50,727 --> 00:14:52,374
I'm sorry

181
00:14:52,776 --> 00:14:54,121
He's still a young kid...

182
00:14:54,445 --> 00:14:56,562
Mom, I didn't do anything wrong

183
00:14:57,545 --> 00:14:58,842
Salute him properly, so we can go

184
00:14:58,843 --> 00:14:59,963
You, too

185
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:02,967
- Good bye, sir
- Ah, yes, good bye

186
00:15:03,748 --> 00:15:05,025
Don't make another trip here

187
00:15:05,026 --> 00:15:06,206
Of course

188
00:15:14,218 --> 00:15:15,756
I called your father...

189
00:15:16,786 --> 00:15:17,941
but he's not answering

190
00:15:21,697 --> 00:15:22,830
How about a home number?

191
00:15:25,188 --> 00:15:29,189
- Jooan, if you have any other family members...
- I don't

192
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:57,600
You are still here?

193
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:01,378
We were stuck here anyway

194
00:16:01,779 --> 00:16:03,993
Only until your father wakes up

195
00:16:07,606 --> 00:16:09,031
Why would you?

196
00:16:09,032 --> 00:16:11,223
You're a strange bunch

197
00:16:15,435 --> 00:16:18,025
You're too strong

198
00:16:18,026 --> 00:16:20,366
He's the strongest
with his broad shoulders

199
00:16:21,265 --> 00:16:22,832
Oh, it's comfy

200
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:01,465
Choi, who went missing
in Nam-gu, Yeongjin-si on the 2nd...

201
00:17:02,483 --> 00:17:04,404
was found nine days later
in the morning of the 10th...

202
00:17:06,405 --> 00:17:09,459
near Hwayong Mountain in Songjoo-si

203
00:17:15,782 --> 00:17:16,878
Remember?

204
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:27,843
The election season is coming,
and you can't even behave yourself

205
00:17:30,656 --> 00:17:34,263
Stay low reading books
and help me prepare my election

206
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:36,592
Ok

207
00:17:37,072 --> 00:17:38,761
You're grounded for the entire vacation

208
00:17:41,214 --> 00:17:42,352
Leave your phone here

209
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,396
- Father
- Get hold of yourself!

210
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:50,682
I told you

211
00:17:51,765 --> 00:17:53,919
Family is like a time bomb to politicians

212
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,721
I'll not allow you to go off...

213
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,516
without my permission

214
00:18:02,521 --> 00:18:03,655
Your phone

215
00:18:18,362 --> 00:18:19,637
Is it my fault if I get hit...

216
00:18:22,937 --> 00:18:25,055
by a car while walking on a street?

217
00:18:28,838 --> 00:18:30,236
It's the driver's fault

218
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:34,650
I just went to the beach. That's all

219
00:18:38,048 --> 00:18:39,261
I...

220
00:18:42,086 --> 00:18:43,502
was just unlucky

221
00:18:44,407 --> 00:18:46,701
That wouldn't have happened
if you weren't there with them

222
00:19:22,517 --> 00:19:23,989
Stick to your level

223
00:19:25,187 --> 00:19:26,388
Don't stoop to their level

224
00:19:46,996 --> 00:19:48,203
I'm sorry

225
00:19:51,178 --> 00:19:52,641
I heard from Mingook...

226
00:19:53,752 --> 00:19:55,049
that one of the boys...

227
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,357
is rumored to have killed his own mother

228
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,440
That's not true

229
00:20:04,367 --> 00:20:05,679
How would you know?

230
00:20:06,273 --> 00:20:07,406
Were you there?

231
00:20:09,085 --> 00:20:10,916
He won't hang out with him anymore

232
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,830
Right?

233
00:20:14,534 --> 00:20:17,032
He might think I'm discriminating,
so I can't even scold him properly

234
00:20:18,535 --> 00:20:20,088
Whether you're my own son or not...

235
00:20:20,889 --> 00:20:22,497
as long as you're living in my house...

236
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:24,690
you follow my rules

237
00:20:25,598 --> 00:20:29,121
If you don't like it, move out.
Understood?

238
00:20:30,315 --> 00:20:31,465
I don't know who he takes after

239
00:20:32,724 --> 00:20:34,486
Jeha said he's sorry

240
00:20:34,487 --> 00:20:38,086
He said he's really sorry on his way home

241
00:20:38,398 --> 00:20:40,086
He won't repeat this again

242
00:20:40,087 --> 00:20:42,495
He promised not to
hang out with them, so...

243
00:20:43,804 --> 00:20:44,962
Honey

244
00:20:45,263 --> 00:20:46,972
Jeha said he's sorry

245
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,188
You don't dare to jump honestly,

246
00:21:10,795 --> 00:21:11,906
right?

247
00:21:15,658 --> 00:21:16,974
You're an attention seeker

248
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:21,756
You act precariously
to make people care for you

249
00:21:22,069 --> 00:21:23,143
I mean...

250
00:21:23,943 --> 00:21:26,350
who would care for you
if you weren't being reckless?

251
00:21:27,285 --> 00:21:29,131
You are flunking your studies

252
00:21:29,726 --> 00:21:31,917
You act like a psycho

253
00:21:34,594 --> 00:21:36,082
They say birds flock together

254
00:21:36,985 --> 00:21:41,609
Your friends either have no parent,
act like a psycho

255
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:43,682
are a criminal, or are broke

256
00:21:44,317 --> 00:21:46,860
Variety of characters there

257
00:21:56,664 --> 00:21:57,741
Why are you smiling?

258
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:01,007
Huh? You think it's funny?

259
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:04,366
I told you I'm out to get you

260
00:22:08,824 --> 00:22:10,132
Go ahead then

261
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:14,310
Don't worry

262
00:22:15,392 --> 00:22:17,393
Whatever I do, your dad won't like me

263
00:22:19,092 --> 00:22:20,992
You only act like this
because you're insecure

264
00:22:22,892 --> 00:22:24,792
Like how my mom stole your place...

265
00:22:26,192 --> 00:22:28,097
you're afraid that I might replace you

266
00:22:33,797 --> 00:22:35,012
Let go of me

267
00:22:36,225 --> 00:22:37,378
I'm tired of all this, too

268
00:22:39,185 --> 00:22:40,259
Do it

269
00:22:45,183 --> 00:22:46,388
Let go

270
00:22:48,726 --> 00:22:51,097
What? Can't bring yourself to it?

271
00:22:52,895 --> 00:22:54,579
- Let go
- Darn it!

272
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:56,522
Let go!

273
00:22:58,235 --> 00:22:59,380
Argh!

274
00:23:22,298 --> 00:23:23,789
Won, Wonjoong...

275
00:23:26,412 --> 00:23:27,709
Wonjoong...

276
00:23:28,805 --> 00:23:31,165
I asked you this in your apartment earlier

277
00:23:32,551 --> 00:23:34,218
but you two were from
the Songho Scholarship Foundation, right?

278
00:23:36,401 --> 00:23:37,528
Yes

279
00:23:38,782 --> 00:23:39,835
You're right

280
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,266
Didn't you guys keep in touch?

281
00:23:45,064 --> 00:23:46,134
No

282
00:23:49,034 --> 00:23:50,178
He said...

283
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:54,641
he was in the psychiatric hospital
and came to me a few days ago

284
00:23:55,549 --> 00:23:57,319
Did he mention...

285
00:23:58,132 --> 00:23:59,319
why he came to you?

286
00:24:18,946 --> 00:24:20,091
I...

287
00:24:21,989 --> 00:24:24,703
will die soon on the beach

288
00:24:30,199 --> 00:24:31,415
Not just once...

289
00:24:33,615 --> 00:24:34,813
but several times

290
00:24:43,018 --> 00:24:47,170
The Seventh Songho Scholarship Foundation
Changjun Kim, Eunjoo Kim, Wonjoong Byeon

291
00:25:03,646 --> 00:25:10,007
We oppose the redevelopment!
Living conditions should be stabilized first!

292
00:25:13,993 --> 00:25:16,554
Only a scumbag will sponge off someone

293
00:25:20,154 --> 00:25:21,475
I'm sorry

294
00:25:21,476 --> 00:25:24,871
You're sorry,
but you leave your post all day?

295
00:25:29,058 --> 00:25:31,041
This car. Since when was it here?

296
00:25:32,732 --> 00:25:34,231
And why didn't you tell me?

297
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,217
I...

298
00:25:37,231 --> 00:25:39,712
- I was going to tow it on my own
- And?

299
00:25:40,312 --> 00:25:41,520
Did you?

300
00:25:45,602 --> 00:25:46,899
I'm sorry

301
00:25:51,682 --> 00:25:53,683
Darn it!

302
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,661
I can't deal with you anymore!

303
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:03,643
- You know your house's under the redevelopment zone?
- Yes

304
00:26:04,139 --> 00:26:06,673
Unless you can get millions out of someone

305
00:26:07,172 --> 00:26:09,773
stand your ground whatever it takes!

306
00:26:10,374 --> 00:26:12,744
Once it's redeveloped,
there'll be new buildings, roads

307
00:26:12,745 --> 00:26:16,441
and everyone will live
happily ever after, right?

308
00:26:16,442 --> 00:26:18,464
Bullshit!

309
00:26:18,762 --> 00:26:21,662
The house price will soar,
and your family...

310
00:26:22,264 --> 00:26:23,311
will be homeless

311
00:26:23,312 --> 00:26:24,467
in an instant

312
00:26:24,963 --> 00:26:26,015
Got it?

313
00:26:29,474 --> 00:26:30,535
Why stand there?

314
00:26:37,367 --> 00:26:38,580
Ladder!

315
00:26:41,779 --> 00:26:44,243
In favor of redevelopment
of Songjoo District 2

316
00:26:44,244 --> 00:26:46,421
Stop the redevelopment
that will drive out residents!

317
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,265
It felt weird back in the police station

318
00:26:56,981 --> 00:26:58,107
Didn't it?

319
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,352
Yeah

320
00:27:03,154 --> 00:27:05,254
I could feel that we still live in...

321
00:27:05,964 --> 00:27:07,051
a hierarchical society

322
00:27:08,019 --> 00:27:09,055
Right?

323
00:27:10,642 --> 00:27:13,344
For Hwan, Cein, and Jeha...

324
00:27:14,742 --> 00:27:17,345
their capable parents came to get them

325
00:27:18,643 --> 00:27:19,892
Hey, at least you...

326
00:27:20,788 --> 00:27:22,760
have a chance to climb up the ladder

327
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:24,599
What have I got?

328
00:27:25,528 --> 00:27:26,680
Based on what?

329
00:27:26,681 --> 00:27:28,067
You're smart

330
00:27:28,068 --> 00:27:29,425
Oh, shoot

331
00:27:30,533 --> 00:27:31,628
Well, I...

332
00:27:32,824 --> 00:27:35,240
have nothing I'm good at

333
00:27:37,342 --> 00:27:38,957
So I'm envious of you guys

334
00:27:40,778 --> 00:27:41,870
Me?

335
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:45,410
Honestly, why would you be envious of me?

336
00:27:46,303 --> 00:27:47,900
It felt weird earlier

337
00:27:49,081 --> 00:27:50,335
All of their parents came

338
00:27:52,131 --> 00:27:54,093
I'm Jeha's mother

339
00:27:54,094 --> 00:27:56,410
I'm Dogeon's mom

340
00:27:57,298 --> 00:27:59,232
But for me...

341
00:28:00,432 --> 00:28:02,047
I'm Hosu's guardian

342
00:28:06,853 --> 00:28:07,901
Ah...

343
00:28:08,699 --> 00:28:09,780
were you?

344
00:28:10,521 --> 00:28:11,535
I didn't know...

345
00:28:12,261 --> 00:28:13,363
Yeah

346
00:28:14,163 --> 00:28:15,946
But I guess I'm the only one who cares

347
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,145
It's hard sometimes

348
00:28:21,954 --> 00:28:23,157
Oh, is the time up?

349
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,664
I'll see if there's any
company housing available

350
00:28:40,776 --> 00:28:42,879
I shouldn't leave you here alone

351
00:28:45,542 --> 00:28:46,689
What about...

352
00:28:47,401 --> 00:28:48,554
my school?

353
00:28:52,945 --> 00:28:56,103
Does school mean anything to you, anyway?

354
00:29:15,534 --> 00:29:17,227
Dogeon, I know

355
00:29:17,228 --> 00:29:20,440
you sometimes wish
you didn't have your family

356
00:29:21,356 --> 00:29:22,565
Hey

357
00:29:23,249 --> 00:29:25,799
Be honest here.
You're jealous of me, right?

358
00:29:26,576 --> 00:29:27,696
Sorry to say this...

359
00:29:30,328 --> 00:29:31,484
but yeah

360
00:29:31,942 --> 00:29:33,106
Several times

361
00:29:34,282 --> 00:29:35,295
Right

362
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:40,981
You look so worn out, you know

363
00:29:43,976 --> 00:29:45,328
They say...

364
00:29:45,727 --> 00:29:49,078
people like us
won't have any place to live

365
00:29:49,664 --> 00:29:52,663
but sometimes I hope
this area will be redeveloped

366
00:29:55,566 --> 00:29:57,836
Once that's done...

367
00:29:58,637 --> 00:30:01,030
it'll be hard for
our family to live together

368
00:30:01,617 --> 00:30:02,755
Then...

369
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:07,727
only then I will have...

370
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:10,744
the opportunity...

371
00:30:13,345 --> 00:30:14,929
to escape from my family

372
00:30:23,332 --> 00:30:25,730
I can give up anything

373
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:28,466
Mom!

374
00:30:29,522 --> 00:30:30,636
But I just can't give up...

375
00:30:31,528 --> 00:30:32,603
on my family

376
00:30:34,293 --> 00:30:35,493
Turn around

377
00:30:39,415 --> 00:30:40,417
Whew

378
00:30:44,691 --> 00:30:46,078
What are all these dumplings?

379
00:30:47,668 --> 00:30:49,265
I bought them because Dad likes them...

380
00:30:55,954 --> 00:30:57,133
Why aren't you eating?

381
00:30:58,367 --> 00:31:00,068
Go ahead. I already ate

382
00:31:01,778 --> 00:31:03,510
Eat before they get cold

383
00:31:06,013 --> 00:31:07,641
I asked for the fire noodles!

384
00:31:14,513 --> 00:31:17,211
They're talking about
the redevelopment again...

385
00:31:18,191 --> 00:31:20,590
after they discovered
the body on the beach

386
00:31:21,494 --> 00:31:25,691
They say things like that only happen
in old neighborhoods...

387
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:29,823
It all depends on how you look at it

388
00:31:36,898 --> 00:31:39,693
What are we going to do
if it's redeveloped?

389
00:31:44,023 --> 00:31:45,459
If we can't find a place here...

390
00:31:46,456 --> 00:31:48,422
we can rent aunt's studio...

391
00:31:50,749 --> 00:31:52,229
Don't even bring her up

392
00:31:52,829 --> 00:31:55,453
Did you forget the time we borrowed
your father's hospital bills?

393
00:31:56,054 --> 00:31:58,592
Your dad supported her
when she got married

394
00:31:58,593 --> 00:32:00,349
and she treated us like beggars

395
00:32:00,748 --> 00:32:01,979
She's a vermin

396
00:32:02,753 --> 00:32:03,901
Then do you have any plans?

397
00:32:05,302 --> 00:32:06,893
Are we going to sleep on the street?

398
00:32:14,893 --> 00:32:16,067
There will be...

399
00:32:17,459 --> 00:32:20,060
a resident meeting on the weekend

400
00:32:21,443 --> 00:32:22,983
Let's attend the meeting together

401
00:32:23,852 --> 00:32:25,077
Fine

402
00:32:29,901 --> 00:32:31,235
Oh, my head hurts

403
00:32:32,835 --> 00:32:33,935
What's all that?

404
00:32:37,894 --> 00:32:39,256
They said it's how you do it

405
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:56,383
Next time, be born a human

406
00:32:57,285 --> 00:32:58,382
Not a cat

407
00:33:01,869 --> 00:33:03,220
Just don't be reborn

408
00:33:05,239 --> 00:33:06,309
It's tough to survive

409
00:33:23,202 --> 00:33:24,612
I'm sorry

410
00:33:24,613 --> 00:33:25,763
I'm sorry

411
00:33:25,764 --> 00:33:27,866
I won't tell anyone

412
00:33:27,867 --> 00:33:29,696
Please don't kill me. Please!

413
00:33:29,697 --> 00:33:30,849
Please don't kill me!

414
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:33,306
I'm sorry. Please don't hurt me!

415
00:33:33,307 --> 00:33:34,469
Aargh!

416
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,509
Please don't kill me!

417
00:35:22,252 --> 00:35:23,391
Ativan 2mg

418
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:39,491
We'll move him

419
00:35:40,475 --> 00:35:41,725
Please move out of the way

420
00:35:56,753 --> 00:36:01,045
Songjoo City Hall

421
00:36:01,046 --> 00:36:05,452
Resident meeting regarding redevelopment
of Songjoo-si District 2

422
00:36:23,963 --> 00:36:25,814
Ah, ah, mic test

423
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,168
Hello

424
00:36:40,501 --> 00:36:41,683
Hwan!

425
00:36:43,945 --> 00:36:47,238
- Yes, Mr. Kim
- How have you been?

426
00:36:53,096 --> 00:36:54,293
Hwan, it's me!

427
00:36:56,327 --> 00:37:00,266
Since most of you are here,
we'll start the meeting

428
00:37:00,849 --> 00:37:04,856
First, let's look at the materials
prepared by the municipality

429
00:37:20,334 --> 00:37:21,431
You remember?

430
00:37:22,327 --> 00:37:23,460
You remember the face?

431
00:37:27,008 --> 00:37:28,029
Yes

432
00:37:31,189 --> 00:37:33,168
I'm sorry. I was scared

433
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:35,476
You're serious?

434
00:37:36,542 --> 00:37:38,059
The one at the arboretum

435
00:37:42,493 --> 00:37:44,447
I saw him even after the incident

436
00:37:48,028 --> 00:37:50,237
I was so scared that I tried to forget...

437
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:54,952
but I remember it like yesterday

438
00:37:58,185 --> 00:37:59,316
That face...

439
00:38:00,163 --> 00:38:01,286
Can you describe that face...

440
00:38:02,018 --> 00:38:03,267
to the police?

441
00:38:08,563 --> 00:38:09,785
Really?

442
00:38:10,465 --> 00:38:12,165
You can describe the face?

443
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:16,907
Is it ok to recall the incident?

444
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:25,179
I don't want to run away anymore

445
00:38:27,347 --> 00:38:29,731
Thank you. Thank you so much

446
00:38:30,886 --> 00:38:32,862
I'll call my parents

447
00:38:33,197 --> 00:38:34,213
I'll be back soon

448
00:38:40,961 --> 00:38:42,821
No! Wait!

449
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,478
This is abnormal

450
00:38:45,988 --> 00:38:49,046
They're spitting nonsense

451
00:38:49,638 --> 00:38:51,615
People who have everything keep repeating

452
00:38:51,616 --> 00:38:54,484
they care for people who have nothing!

453
00:38:54,485 --> 00:38:56,697
- That's right!
- They're talking nonsense

454
00:38:58,741 --> 00:38:59,921
Legislator Changjoon Kim!

455
00:39:01,407 --> 00:39:03,718
No, ex-legislator

456
00:39:05,331 --> 00:39:08,345
After getting the votes from us

457
00:39:09,133 --> 00:39:13,004
you'll wash your hands
and leave us, right?

458
00:39:14,028 --> 00:39:16,406
After you're elected with our votes!

459
00:39:18,505 --> 00:39:21,394
You'll leave for Seoul

460
00:39:21,977 --> 00:39:23,074
Will you not?

461
00:39:24,405 --> 00:39:26,556
Please, calm down

462
00:39:26,557 --> 00:39:27,920
Today...

463
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:32,676
we are not here to listen from both sides

464
00:39:33,254 --> 00:39:34,883
Regarding the redevelopment

465
00:39:34,884 --> 00:39:38,764
to objectively consider
merits and demerits

466
00:39:38,765 --> 00:39:40,182
Explain in plain words!

467
00:39:40,183 --> 00:39:42,772
Simply get to the point!

468
00:39:42,773 --> 00:39:44,726
- So are we redeveloping or not?
- What's the point of explaining?

469
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:50,303
Are you looking down on us?

470
00:39:53,326 --> 00:39:54,565
What a disaster!

471
00:39:54,566 --> 00:39:55,814
What's in it for you?

472
00:39:57,852 --> 00:39:59,328
Sir, what brings you here?

473
00:40:14,896 --> 00:40:16,078
My name is Changjun Kim

474
00:40:22,182 --> 00:40:23,478
Isn't that Jooan's father?

475
00:40:30,265 --> 00:40:31,774
On what business are you here?

476
00:40:35,125 --> 00:40:36,314
Wonjoong...

477
00:40:40,087 --> 00:40:41,619
Wonjoong's dead

478
00:40:45,252 --> 00:40:46,408
Sorry?

479
00:40:47,941 --> 00:40:49,092
I said Wonjoong's...

480
00:40:51,853 --> 00:40:53,019
dead

481
00:40:54,983 --> 00:40:56,679
The body that was found on the beach...

482
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:59,275
He's from the neighborhood

483
00:40:59,751 --> 00:41:01,054
His name's Wonjoong Byeon

484
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,063
Who is it?

485
00:41:15,648 --> 00:41:16,729
Cein

486
00:41:17,746 --> 00:41:19,269
I'm sorry to come at this late hour

487
00:41:22,578 --> 00:41:23,656
Is your father home?

488
00:41:23,951 --> 00:41:25,247
Oh, my dad?

489
00:41:25,994 --> 00:41:28,125
Yes, why?

490
00:41:28,126 --> 00:41:29,274
I have something...

491
00:41:29,951 --> 00:41:31,424
to ask

492
00:41:33,223 --> 00:41:34,353
Oh, ok

493
00:41:35,208 --> 00:41:36,226
Come in

494
00:41:46,019 --> 00:41:47,208
Dad...

495
00:41:48,232 --> 00:41:50,274
Cein's here...

496
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,711
Go out...

497
00:42:19,653 --> 00:42:21,098
and get me two bottles of soju

498
00:42:22,427 --> 00:42:24,840
- Dad, are you drinking again...
- Go

499
00:42:29,211 --> 00:42:30,558
I'll just buy one bottle

500
00:42:35,009 --> 00:42:37,999
Why's he drinking again?

501
00:42:46,013 --> 00:42:47,333
If it's about your mom

502
00:42:52,749 --> 00:42:53,955
I'm sorry

503
00:42:57,395 --> 00:42:59,435
You already told me
you have nothing to say...

504
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,736
but it's not fair

505
00:43:04,863 --> 00:43:06,044
The principal told me...

506
00:43:07,306 --> 00:43:09,739
that my mom was
a delinquent in high school

507
00:43:11,615 --> 00:43:14,499
But mom I remember...

508
00:43:17,335 --> 00:43:18,696
wasn't like that

509
00:43:20,708 --> 00:43:22,440
But I can't argue any more than this...

510
00:43:27,706 --> 00:43:29,833
because I don't know
what she was like in high school

511
00:43:36,829 --> 00:43:38,008
I...

512
00:43:40,135 --> 00:43:41,607
I can put up if I did something wrong...

513
00:43:42,356 --> 00:43:44,824
or even if I get mistaken
for things I didn't do

514
00:43:54,604 --> 00:43:55,796
But if my mom...

515
00:43:58,757 --> 00:43:59,913
my mom...

516
00:44:02,744 --> 00:44:04,305
is getting mistaken...

517
00:44:07,176 --> 00:44:08,806
for something she didn't do...

518
00:44:16,312 --> 00:44:18,029
I can't stand it

519
00:44:23,012 --> 00:44:24,877
And I hope I'm right

520
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:29,281
Please

521
00:44:37,850 --> 00:44:38,970
Eunjoo...

522
00:44:44,335 --> 00:44:45,519
wasn't like that

523
00:44:50,583 --> 00:44:52,607
I got messed up, too

524
00:44:53,426 --> 00:44:55,131
Everyone's messed up

525
00:44:56,723 --> 00:44:58,537
Wonjoong, me, Eunjoo...

526
00:44:59,031 --> 00:45:00,854
and Changjun. Everyone's messed up

527
00:45:00,855 --> 00:45:02,036
What am I going to do?

528
00:45:07,301 --> 00:45:09,334
Please let me finish my studies here

529
00:45:10,876 --> 00:45:12,067
I'll stay low

530
00:45:13,485 --> 00:45:15,309
I won't be late to school
and get into trouble

531
00:45:20,479 --> 00:45:21,600
I promise

532
00:45:53,046 --> 00:45:56,716
Why did that bastard leave his car here?

533
00:46:03,925 --> 00:46:05,147
It's obvious

534
00:46:05,732 --> 00:46:07,540
It's so obvious

535
00:46:08,958 --> 00:46:11,030
It's done by those twits
who want to buy this land cheap

536
00:46:11,031 --> 00:46:14,850
and proceed with the redevelopment

537
00:46:16,561 --> 00:46:19,661
Even the police are working hand in glove

538
00:46:20,850 --> 00:46:22,030
Hey

539
00:46:22,782 --> 00:46:24,369
You're being loud here

540
00:46:24,952 --> 00:46:26,071
What?

541
00:46:26,381 --> 00:46:28,286
Did I say something wrong?

542
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:31,610
I'm sorry

543
00:46:32,070 --> 00:46:33,994
- Sir
- They!

544
00:46:34,404 --> 00:46:36,644
call me a holdout for earning money

545
00:46:37,295 --> 00:46:40,214
from this tiny piece of land

546
00:46:40,755 --> 00:46:44,353
Is it fair for rich people
to drive everyone out

547
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:46,935
and earn a fortune from the redevelopment?

548
00:46:49,082 --> 00:46:51,138
It has nothing to do with them

549
00:46:51,139 --> 00:46:54,027
I'm at a breaking point.
You think I'd care who's who?

550
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,438
They think they can step on us
if we don't create a scene!

551
00:47:02,341 --> 00:47:03,511
Is he drunk?

552
00:47:04,846 --> 00:47:05,957
Darn it

553
00:47:26,853 --> 00:47:30,470
H. Park

554
00:47:51,023 --> 00:47:52,162
Jihan

555
00:47:53,265 --> 00:47:54,470
That's what they call me

556
00:47:56,417 --> 00:47:57,554
I'm not just "Choi"

557
00:47:59,731 --> 00:48:00,830
Ah...

558
00:48:04,322 --> 00:48:05,340
Ok

559
00:48:55,556 --> 00:48:58,206
Wait, wait detective

560
00:48:58,207 --> 00:49:00,176
Haru, talk to me

561
00:49:00,177 --> 00:49:02,773
You said you remember

562
00:49:02,774 --> 00:49:04,122
You said you remember

563
00:49:07,506 --> 00:49:10,565
There's no guarantee that
your memory's accurate

564
00:49:10,566 --> 00:49:12,096
It happened years ago

565
00:49:13,152 --> 00:49:14,773
You were in your elementary school

566
00:49:15,181 --> 00:49:16,643
Do you remember
everything from those days?

567
00:49:17,089 --> 00:49:18,213
No

568
00:49:20,087 --> 00:49:21,590
He's right

569
00:49:21,591 --> 00:49:24,480
I don't think
it's good for you to stay with him

570
00:49:25,327 --> 00:49:27,590
Let's find another hospital

571
00:49:35,899 --> 00:49:39,503
We'll fight on

572
00:51:22,299 --> 00:51:31,030
We must survive!

573
00:51:51,831 --> 00:52:00,802
Redevelopment, Jooan, Dogeon, Beach,
Haru, Cein, Father

574
00:52:09,676 --> 00:52:10,926
Hwan

575
00:52:13,587 --> 00:52:15,276
Oh, you were studying

576
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:19,726
You got a message

577
00:52:23,710 --> 00:52:25,518
Only when your father isn't looking

578
00:52:25,519 --> 00:52:27,557
He's still drinking in the old house

579
00:52:28,830 --> 00:52:30,444
How would kids these days
survive without a phone?

580
00:52:32,387 --> 00:52:34,110
- Thank you
- No problem

581
00:52:34,692 --> 00:52:36,315
- I'll get going
- Ok

582
00:52:47,730 --> 00:52:49,082
Group chat
Wow, he's super ugly

583
00:52:49,083 --> 00:52:50,826
Should warn us before posting gross pics

584
00:52:50,827 --> 00:52:52,204
Can't unsee what I've seen

585
00:52:52,205 --> 00:52:54,316
Jooan, you can no longer
enter the dry container

586
00:52:54,317 --> 00:52:55,477
You ungrateful fella

587
00:52:55,478 --> 00:52:57,462
That number 2 is Hwan and Haru, right?

588
00:52:57,463 --> 00:52:58,872
I just came back from the States

589
00:52:58,873 --> 00:53:00,403
Can I enter the dry container, Dogeon?

590
00:53:00,404 --> 00:53:02,612
Everyone's welcome except Jooan Kim

591
00:53:05,149 --> 00:53:06,437
I can't go out

592
00:53:07,348 --> 00:53:08,406
Why?

593
00:53:10,088 --> 00:53:11,380
Hwan's grounded

594
00:53:12,282 --> 00:53:13,335
What?

595
00:53:14,183 --> 00:53:16,157
You're not going out
because you're grounded?

596
00:53:16,608 --> 00:53:19,265
- Amazing
- He's not Pooh Man, unlike you

597
00:53:19,844 --> 00:53:21,465
It's Bear Man!

598
00:53:25,147 --> 00:53:26,185
Hwan

599
00:53:35,926 --> 00:53:37,727
We met before, right?

600
00:53:43,777 --> 00:53:45,661
Yeah, we've met

601
00:53:45,662 --> 00:53:48,339
You look like Changjun
when he declared he'd be a politician

602
00:53:50,361 --> 00:53:51,733
Is that so?

603
00:53:51,734 --> 00:53:53,145
Sit

604
00:54:02,402 --> 00:54:05,948
I collect stones as a hobby

605
00:54:05,949 --> 00:54:09,281
An expert who's been studying
stones for 40 years...

606
00:54:10,131 --> 00:54:12,370
told me I have keen eyes

607
00:54:13,036 --> 00:54:14,101
Of course

608
00:54:14,925 --> 00:54:17,981
That's how you could look after us

609
00:54:19,323 --> 00:54:22,070
If it weren't for
your father and grandfather,

610
00:54:22,071 --> 00:54:24,318
Songjoo would still be in the sticks

611
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:25,429
Think about it

612
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:29,878
It was pure mud field where no one visited

613
00:54:31,718 --> 00:54:34,989
Those roaches looking for
food only on the ground

614
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:41,098
If it weren't for those
lower classes living like moss...

615
00:54:42,985 --> 00:54:44,341
I came back here again...

616
00:54:45,150 --> 00:54:48,238
and it seems conditions are
worse off than in my father's days

617
00:54:48,890 --> 00:54:50,448
They don't even pay enough taxes

618
00:54:50,792 --> 00:54:53,326
They pay only few bucks

619
00:54:53,327 --> 00:54:55,650
and ask the government to do this, do that

620
00:54:55,651 --> 00:54:56,852
Those shameless rats

621
00:54:57,930 --> 00:54:59,656
You saw them

622
00:54:59,657 --> 00:55:00,678
during the resident meeting

623
00:55:00,679 --> 00:55:03,396
Owns just a shack...

624
00:55:03,907 --> 00:55:06,595
but makes all that fuss

625
00:55:08,024 --> 00:55:09,485
With one fork crane...

626
00:55:10,589 --> 00:55:12,036
we can wipe them out...

627
00:55:18,395 --> 00:55:19,735
overnight

628
00:55:20,419 --> 00:55:21,754
Don't you agree?

629
00:55:24,488 --> 00:55:26,525
You should keep this in mind

630
00:55:27,207 --> 00:55:29,282
- Did you say your name's Hwan?
- Yes

631
00:55:29,523 --> 00:55:33,191
Do you know the Noah's Ark from the Bible?

632
00:55:34,113 --> 00:55:37,448
We need a person to open the ark door

633
00:55:38,988 --> 00:55:42,884
You may be unsure whether it's raining

634
00:55:42,885 --> 00:55:45,776
windy, or flooding outside

635
00:55:46,187 --> 00:55:50,528
but the courage to open up
the door to find out...

636
00:55:50,933 --> 00:55:55,244
We need that courage in Songjoo now

637
00:55:55,245 --> 00:55:56,788
Yes, you're right

638
00:55:56,789 --> 00:55:59,339
That's what his autobiography's about

639
00:55:59,677 --> 00:56:01,037
That's his story

640
00:56:02,314 --> 00:56:04,537
What was the title?

641
00:56:05,726 --> 00:56:07,085
Walk...

642
00:56:08,146 --> 00:56:09,279
Towards The Light

643
00:56:09,670 --> 00:56:12,625
Yes, Walk Towards The Light

644
00:56:13,209 --> 00:56:14,535
Cheers!

645
00:56:20,090 --> 00:56:21,337
Now

646
00:56:23,421 --> 00:56:24,793
I'll pour you a drink

647
00:56:24,794 --> 00:56:25,991
No

648
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:31,244
'Walk Towards The Light'

649
00:56:56,069 --> 00:56:57,817
Have you ever read it properly?

650
00:57:10,514 --> 00:57:13,112
I don't like it

651
00:57:14,879 --> 00:57:16,100
During the resident meeting...

652
00:57:17,398 --> 00:57:18,579
you lied, didn't you?

653
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:23,885
You're in favor of the redevelopment

654
00:57:25,333 --> 00:57:26,451
after all...

655
00:57:30,657 --> 00:57:32,001
if that's what politics is about...

656
00:57:35,028 --> 00:57:37,662
why do you ask me to follow your steps?

657
00:57:41,107 --> 00:57:43,176
Don't parents normally give...

658
00:57:44,757 --> 00:57:45,993
what's only good for their child?

659
00:57:47,535 --> 00:57:48,750
Go to bed

660
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:53,170
You don't mean to...

661
00:57:54,909 --> 00:57:57,367
make me a liar as well

662
00:58:05,865 --> 00:58:06,890
"Songjoo is..."

663
00:58:09,627 --> 00:58:11,356
"for me, a place filled with memories"

664
00:58:13,941 --> 00:58:14,985
"I will protect you"

665
00:58:17,134 --> 00:58:18,498
"I will make sure..."

666
00:58:19,902 --> 00:58:22,323
"esteemed people
like you won't be driven out"

667
00:58:39,856 --> 00:58:40,964
So?

668
00:58:42,119 --> 00:58:43,636
"Support me to protect Songjoo..."

669
00:58:46,850 --> 00:58:49,526
"like my father and grandfather"

670
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:51,500
You said this

671
00:58:52,098 --> 00:58:53,270
You said it clearly

672
00:58:54,086 --> 00:58:55,771
What's your point?

673
00:58:57,774 --> 00:58:59,039
You lied

674
00:59:01,426 --> 00:59:03,231
You knew...

675
00:59:03,906 --> 00:59:05,280
those people who believe in your lie

676
00:59:05,281 --> 00:59:07,911
can't survive without it

677
00:59:07,912 --> 00:59:09,426
- Stop
- Is this...

678
00:59:11,682 --> 00:59:12,891
how you walk...

679
00:59:18,106 --> 00:59:20,945
towards the light?

680
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:06,022
Blackout again?

681
01:00:06,596 --> 01:00:07,773
Oh, my

682
01:00:08,862 --> 01:00:10,321
Oh, it's the blackout

683
01:00:10,322 --> 01:00:12,023
I know. I guess every light is out

684
01:00:12,024 --> 01:00:13,559
The power's out in the entire neighborhood

685
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:15,498
Oh, my

686
01:00:15,499 --> 01:00:16,654
What's happening?

687
01:00:25,155 --> 01:00:26,402
Hwan Kim!

688
01:00:45,973 --> 01:00:47,148
Hwan Kim

689
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:52,625
Come back

690
01:01:34,474 --> 01:01:35,701
Hwan Kim!

691
01:02:03,989 --> 01:02:05,211
Be careful

692
01:02:10,287 --> 01:02:11,472
This is nice

693
01:02:12,941 --> 01:02:14,040
Cein

694
01:02:14,361 --> 01:02:16,482
How did you know about the spare key here?

695
01:02:16,483 --> 01:02:17,551
Ah...

696
01:02:18,579 --> 01:02:19,904
That's what my dad used to do

697
01:02:20,485 --> 01:02:22,284
Why did the power go out all of a sudden?

698
01:02:25,174 --> 01:02:26,364
What's wrong?

699
01:02:28,307 --> 01:02:29,692
Do you miss the States already?

700
01:02:31,869 --> 01:02:32,890
Yeah

701
01:02:33,802 --> 01:02:36,253
I also want to go to the States

702
01:02:37,661 --> 01:02:38,988
The land of the heroes

703
01:02:39,507 --> 01:02:42,388
I want to grow up and get my license

704
01:02:43,813 --> 01:02:46,940
If I get a license,
I'll give you a ride first

705
01:02:47,619 --> 01:02:48,979
No thanks

706
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:52,850
I'm not thinking about living a long life,
but I want to die in peace

707
01:02:53,399 --> 01:02:54,626
I'll give you a ride!

708
01:02:55,105 --> 01:02:57,729
- Jeha, let's get some firewood
- Ok

709
01:02:59,005 --> 01:03:00,976
- Let's go together
- Fine

710
01:03:51,233 --> 01:03:52,747
CHOCOSU!

711
01:03:52,748 --> 01:03:54,123
CHOCOSU!

712
01:03:54,333 --> 01:03:55,788
CHOCOSU!

713
01:04:08,860 --> 01:04:10,486
CHOCOSU!

714
01:04:12,739 --> 01:04:14,715
- Dope!
- Dope!

715
01:04:15,708 --> 01:04:17,130
CHOCOSU!

716
01:04:23,231 --> 01:04:24,614
CHOCOSU!

717
01:04:24,992 --> 01:04:26,215
CHOCOSU!

718
01:04:26,650 --> 01:04:28,563
Oh, wow

719
01:04:28,564 --> 01:04:29,906
- You're dope!
- You're a celeb!

720
01:04:32,425 --> 01:04:34,183
Oh, it's Hwan

721
01:04:47,302 --> 01:04:48,579
Oh, Hwan!
