This series is based on a fictionalized story inspired by the story of BTS's album,
The Most Beautiful Moment in Life,
and is not related to BTS members and their families.    Child actors and animals were filmed
in safe conditions under the supervision of their guardians.

00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:11,885
Cein Min

3
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:18,995
Cein Min?

4
00:00:21,662 --> 00:00:23,039
I don't know him

5
00:00:26,709 --> 00:00:27,711
But...

6
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:30,704
can he...

7
00:00:31,847 --> 00:00:33,559
get my family back?

8
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:36,208
Are you sure?

9
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:44,114
If that's really true...

10
00:00:45,897 --> 00:00:47,233
I want my old family back...

11
00:00:49,901 --> 00:00:50,931
not...

12
00:00:51,855 --> 00:00:52,878
the current one

13
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:55,846
Because that's...

14
00:00:58,494 --> 00:00:59,964
my real family

15
00:01:05,289 --> 00:01:07,432
Promise me you'll get my old family back

16
00:01:08,836 --> 00:01:09,842
Then I will do it

17
00:01:27,647 --> 00:01:28,816
Swear it

18
00:01:30,878 --> 00:01:32,218
I don't know who you are

19
00:01:33,276 --> 00:01:34,514
You look super suspicious...

20
00:01:39,303 --> 00:01:40,627
but I want to believe you...

21
00:01:43,832 --> 00:01:44,841
so I will

22
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:57,279
How long...

23
00:01:57,806 --> 00:01:59,284
do I have to hold him?

24
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,338
Yes, Mrs. Hwang

25
00:03:00,486 --> 00:03:03,730
Something came up

26
00:03:04,568 --> 00:03:06,074
I'm sorry, but we can't join you

27
00:03:06,075 --> 00:03:07,423
in the early morning prayer

28
00:03:09,635 --> 00:03:11,608
No, it's nothing to worry about

29
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:12,657
It's nothing serious

30
00:03:13,886 --> 00:03:15,862
Yes, thank you

31
00:03:27,388 --> 00:03:28,388
Haru Park

32
00:03:39,624 --> 00:03:40,630
Haru

33
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:42,761
Haru Park

34
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,216
If you cut me off like this

35
00:03:47,217 --> 00:03:49,167
you can no longer officially be
CHOCOSU's no. 1 fan

36
00:03:50,667 --> 00:03:51,723
Scary, isn't it?

37
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:53,614
Unbelievable, right?

38
00:03:55,574 --> 00:03:56,982
So text me back

39
00:04:04,196 --> 00:04:10,607
Messages Unread

40
00:04:15,082 --> 00:04:16,971
I don't know whether you heard the news...

41
00:04:17,827 --> 00:04:18,860
but Cein

42
00:04:20,697 --> 00:04:21,735
Excuse me

43
00:04:23,372 --> 00:04:24,424
Hwan

44
00:04:28,388 --> 00:04:30,500
Disciplinary Review by the School Violence
Deliberation Committee

45
00:04:30,501 --> 00:04:32,453
Disciplinary Outcome /
Suspension (until transfer)

46
00:04:32,454 --> 00:04:33,680
Transfer

47
00:04:33,681 --> 00:04:35,153
They decided to transfer him

48
00:04:37,055 --> 00:04:38,798
They say
it's better than being expelled...

49
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:40,914
but I'm not sure

50
00:04:44,141 --> 00:04:45,726
Jeha's probably having the hardest time

51
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:48,650
Come to think of it,
it's been a while since I saw him

52
00:04:48,651 --> 00:04:51,041
You should eat something
to take the medicine

53
00:04:52,788 --> 00:04:53,953
Come on

54
00:04:54,339 --> 00:04:55,417
Eat up

55
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,269
Are you sure
you can go to school tomorrow?

56
00:05:04,436 --> 00:05:05,799
Still hurts, doesn't it?

57
00:05:07,103 --> 00:05:08,179
I'm fine

58
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:11,741
That guy's suspended until he transfers...

59
00:05:12,322 --> 00:05:13,409
so you won't meet him

60
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:14,575
in school

61
00:05:15,061 --> 00:05:16,567
If he doesn't move out of the area soon

62
00:05:16,568 --> 00:05:17,821
I'll sue him right off the bat

63
00:05:22,954 --> 00:05:23,954
Mingook Seo

64
00:05:25,297 --> 00:05:26,322
Yes?

65
00:05:26,842 --> 00:05:29,369
Why did you pass by
that place on that day?

66
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:36,750
I...

67
00:05:37,144 --> 00:05:39,306
I was going to...

68
00:05:39,433 --> 00:05:40,472
He said he was on his way to

69
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:42,462
an internet cafe with his friends

70
00:05:43,994 --> 00:05:45,029
Internet cafe...

71
00:05:46,756 --> 00:05:47,892
is nowhere near that place

72
00:05:50,538 --> 00:05:52,274
I... um...

73
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,325
On that day...

74
00:05:56,344 --> 00:05:57,864
Mingook saw

75
00:05:57,865 --> 00:05:59,805
Jeha crying in school

76
00:05:59,806 --> 00:06:00,982
because of Cein

77
00:06:01,934 --> 00:06:03,850
Jeha wasn't home until late

78
00:06:03,851 --> 00:06:05,334
and wasn't answering his phone

79
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,970
It looked like he got worried
and went out to check

80
00:06:10,404 --> 00:06:11,564
Thank you, Mingook

81
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,395
If it weren't for you

82
00:06:13,396 --> 00:06:15,283
Jeha would've been in big trouble

83
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:18,100
Yes

84
00:06:20,239 --> 00:06:21,390
Eat up

85
00:06:23,574 --> 00:06:24,692
You, too

86
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:17,235
Hwan

87
00:08:17,236 --> 00:08:18,769
Have you tried reaching Cein?

88
00:08:21,185 --> 00:08:22,226
I can't

89
00:08:24,431 --> 00:08:26,050
Even his phone's turned off

90
00:08:26,983 --> 00:08:28,043
Me, too

91
00:08:30,031 --> 00:08:31,434
Even if I do, I don't know

92
00:08:31,435 --> 00:08:32,484
what I'd say

93
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,459
Have you seen Jeha?

94
00:08:39,672 --> 00:08:40,744
No

95
00:08:41,448 --> 00:08:43,498
I meant to ask him
if I meet him in the apartment...

96
00:08:44,886 --> 00:08:46,552
but I think he's stuck in his house

97
00:08:56,181 --> 00:08:58,360
How can you still have the appetite?

98
00:08:59,713 --> 00:09:01,152
You should eat up no matter what happens

99
00:09:01,785 --> 00:09:02,892
Cein transferring school?

100
00:09:03,289 --> 00:09:04,424
Not being able to reach Jeha?

101
00:09:06,231 --> 00:09:08,042
Mrs. Kim told me to do what I can do...

102
00:09:08,974 --> 00:09:10,178
if there's nothing I can do

103
00:09:10,179 --> 00:09:11,312
for the moment

104
00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:12,970
If waiting's all I can do

105
00:09:12,971 --> 00:09:14,060
I will wait

106
00:09:14,571 --> 00:09:16,141
If you wait for the person to come

107
00:09:16,142 --> 00:09:17,786
at least he has a place to return to

108
00:09:22,575 --> 00:09:24,108
If you're not eating that, I'll have it

109
00:09:30,038 --> 00:09:31,525
Do you still go to see Haru?

110
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,587
You don't even know his unit number

111
00:09:34,113 --> 00:09:35,496
The fact that he dropped out of school...

112
00:09:36,391 --> 00:09:37,933
means he's probably hospitalized again

113
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:39,132
No

114
00:09:41,094 --> 00:09:42,590
If he's hospitalized, he'd have told me

115
00:09:43,718 --> 00:09:45,751
I think it's something else this time

116
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,188
But me going to Haru...

117
00:09:50,761 --> 00:09:52,556
is for my peace of mind, too

118
00:09:54,123 --> 00:09:56,489
I feel like
I shouldn't have sent him alone

119
00:10:01,607 --> 00:10:03,776
The landlord sold our house.
We only have two months

120
00:10:05,902 --> 00:10:07,340
Are you waiting for a call?

121
00:10:08,844 --> 00:10:10,698
- I thought it was Jooan
- Why?

122
00:10:11,589 --> 00:10:13,239
Is something going on
between you and Jooan?

123
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:15,343
It's all my fault

124
00:10:15,962 --> 00:10:17,727
I shouldn't have poured it out on him

125
00:10:19,096 --> 00:10:20,296
If it's your fault, apologize

126
00:10:21,365 --> 00:10:22,798
What? Is he not accepting your apology?

127
00:10:23,798 --> 00:10:25,347
Then apologize until he accepts it

128
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:28,153
If he shouts and hits you, just take it

129
00:10:28,292 --> 00:10:29,637
Take the blame if it's your fault

130
00:10:30,897 --> 00:10:32,322
At times like that, throw your
ego, age that sort of thing away

131
00:10:32,323 --> 00:10:33,691
to a dog

132
00:10:33,692 --> 00:10:34,949
No, no

133
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:36,176
Don't even throw them to a dog

134
00:10:36,795 --> 00:10:37,826
Even the dog will be upset

135
00:10:41,506 --> 00:10:43,141
Yeah, I'm leaving now

136
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:46,297
Where are you?

137
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,059
I'll talk to you later

138
00:10:56,376 --> 00:10:57,461
Hey, Jeha Jeon

139
00:11:08,118 --> 00:11:09,475
When did you come to school?

140
00:11:11,145 --> 00:11:12,188
How's your head?

141
00:11:13,127 --> 00:11:14,185
Are you alright?

142
00:11:15,687 --> 00:11:17,328
Why didn't you call me?

143
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:20,573
I'm ok

144
00:11:24,446 --> 00:11:25,503
Did Cein...

145
00:11:26,945 --> 00:11:28,162
really do it?

146
00:11:33,363 --> 00:11:34,777
Did Cein hit you?

147
00:11:35,163 --> 00:11:36,163
Just tell me

148
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,897
I said I'm going!

149
00:11:45,694 --> 00:11:46,901
Get well treated

150
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,598
Jooan, where are you going?

151
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,389
What about your class?

152
00:11:52,096 --> 00:11:53,467
Class and home...

153
00:11:55,255 --> 00:11:56,647
They're meaningless

154
00:11:59,789 --> 00:12:01,450
We are all screwed anyway

155
00:12:26,764 --> 00:12:29,943
Songjoo-si should stop the redevelopment!

156
00:12:29,944 --> 00:12:32,168
- Stop, stop
- Stop, stop

157
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:35,938
Those who ignore their residents
should step down!

158
00:12:35,939 --> 00:12:38,049
- Step down, step down
- Step down, step down

159
00:12:38,266 --> 00:12:40,160
Songjoo-si should take

160
00:12:40,161 --> 00:12:42,135
responsibility for their residents!

161
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:44,303
- Take responsibility
- Take responsibility

162
00:13:06,624 --> 00:13:07,694
I!

163
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:12,116
lied to you all

164
00:13:18,621 --> 00:13:19,823
I, Changjun Kim...

165
00:13:22,693 --> 00:13:23,940
knew that

166
00:13:23,941 --> 00:13:25,058
I couldn't do anything

167
00:13:25,059 --> 00:13:26,204
without your support...

168
00:13:34,485 --> 00:13:35,491
But still...

169
00:13:38,099 --> 00:13:39,861
I lied and promised...

170
00:13:42,174 --> 00:13:44,267
to protect Songjoo...

171
00:13:48,257 --> 00:13:49,808
and you

172
00:13:51,513 --> 00:13:52,589
What did I tell you?

173
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:53,903
He's nothing but a lie

174
00:13:56,613 --> 00:13:57,950
But I beg you...

175
00:14:00,725 --> 00:14:02,521
to trust my lies

176
00:14:02,522 --> 00:14:04,361
one more time

177
00:14:07,572 --> 00:14:09,750
No matter how much Songjoo is developed...

178
00:14:11,913 --> 00:14:13,001
if you, the foundation

179
00:14:13,002 --> 00:14:14,660
of Songjoo, are not here...

180
00:14:17,425 --> 00:14:18,820
we can't call it Songjoo

181
00:14:21,838 --> 00:14:23,585
Because you're here...

182
00:14:26,295 --> 00:14:27,797
Songjoo is what it is

183
00:14:28,873 --> 00:14:29,937
Songjoo!

184
00:14:34,283 --> 00:14:35,845
is rightfully yours

185
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,169
- I agree! I agree!
- I agree!

186
00:14:45,894 --> 00:14:47,211
Please...

187
00:14:48,568 --> 00:14:50,184
have faith one more time

188
00:14:53,858 --> 00:14:55,011
I beg you

189
00:15:09,832 --> 00:15:12,257
Stand up! Stand up!

190
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,892
Changjun Kim!

191
00:15:20,881 --> 00:15:22,401
Changjun Kim!

192
00:15:22,402 --> 00:15:25,696
- Changjun Kim! Changjun Kim!
- Get up

193
00:15:25,697 --> 00:15:27,916
It's ok. Get up. Get up

194
00:15:30,746 --> 00:15:32,822
- Get up
- It's ok

195
00:15:33,136 --> 00:15:36,426
- Changjun Kim! Changjun Kim!
- Changjun Kim! Changjun Kim!

196
00:15:36,427 --> 00:15:39,680
- Changjun Kim! Changjun Kim!
- Changjun Kim! Changjun Kim!

197
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,342
That used to be the case...

198
00:15:50,161 --> 00:15:51,989
but I don't know much about
my father's business

199
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,024
No

200
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,290
Our principal's a good person...

201
00:15:55,761 --> 00:15:56,952
at least to me

202
00:15:56,953 --> 00:15:58,373
It'd be better for Cein to transfer...

203
00:15:59,688 --> 00:16:00,738
school

204
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:29,225
Is it yet...

205
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:30,868
to be published?

206
00:16:30,869 --> 00:16:32,352
We're calling the national newspaper

207
00:16:32,353 --> 00:16:33,796
so it will be published by today

208
00:16:35,532 --> 00:16:38,206
If only you sorted out
the container site earlier...

209
00:16:38,933 --> 00:16:40,936
it wouldn't have taken us this long

210
00:16:42,103 --> 00:16:43,942
Should've gotten rid of that scrub

211
00:16:44,537 --> 00:16:45,576
The pesky thing...

212
00:16:45,992 --> 00:16:48,432
about that owner guy's that...

213
00:16:48,721 --> 00:16:49,780
he stationed...

214
00:16:49,781 --> 00:16:51,522
a high schooler there

215
00:16:52,925 --> 00:16:54,300
If we mess up

216
00:16:54,301 --> 00:16:56,500
we'll be suspected 100%

217
00:16:57,379 --> 00:16:58,453
We're secretly

218
00:16:58,454 --> 00:17:00,151
intimidating them

219
00:17:00,313 --> 00:17:01,912
so they'll leave the area soon

220
00:17:04,182 --> 00:17:05,324
I told you

221
00:17:05,767 --> 00:17:08,253
- You can't stop the redevelopment
- They were talking about Dogeon

222
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:12,022
- Did you know that too?
- Lower your voice

223
00:17:14,127 --> 00:17:15,156
Yes

224
00:17:16,025 --> 00:17:17,118
I knew

225
00:17:18,453 --> 00:17:19,693
That was why I didn't tell you

226
00:17:20,433 --> 00:17:21,631
I was afraid you would make a scene

227
00:17:21,632 --> 00:17:23,012
and run away like the last time

228
00:17:23,492 --> 00:17:25,189
Me and my dad not falling apart...

229
00:17:26,028 --> 00:17:27,503
is more important than protecting Dogeon?

230
00:17:27,762 --> 00:17:29,134
Nothing happened yet

231
00:17:29,135 --> 00:17:30,455
Why are you so agitated?

232
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:34,182
Where are you going?

233
00:17:34,673 --> 00:17:35,933
You're going to tell him?

234
00:17:37,898 --> 00:17:39,468
I know what you're thinking

235
00:17:40,265 --> 00:17:41,578
But he won't do anything

236
00:17:41,579 --> 00:17:42,694
to a person his son's age

237
00:17:50,075 --> 00:17:51,180
Promise me, then...

238
00:17:53,722 --> 00:17:55,089
that you will make sure

239
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:56,393
nothing happens to Dogeon

240
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:58,859
Fine

241
00:17:59,393 --> 00:18:00,624
I'll look out for him

242
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,886
I promise, so have some faith

243
00:18:34,505 --> 00:18:35,595
Hey, Jooan Kim

244
00:18:50,194 --> 00:18:51,331
Why didn't you answer my call?

245
00:18:52,811 --> 00:18:53,820
You weren't even at your house

246
00:18:53,821 --> 00:18:54,915
Where are you these days?

247
00:18:55,205 --> 00:18:56,265
How about your school?

248
00:19:01,918 --> 00:19:02,969
I'm...

249
00:19:05,268 --> 00:19:07,666
I'm sorry about what happened that day

250
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:10,755
I was angry at myself...

251
00:19:11,534 --> 00:19:12,659
but I took it out on you

252
00:19:13,281 --> 00:19:14,558
It doesn't matter

253
00:19:16,595 --> 00:19:18,420
My dad isn't angry at me

254
00:19:18,421 --> 00:19:19,582
but he beats me up every time

255
00:19:21,659 --> 00:19:22,677
On that day...

256
00:19:24,305 --> 00:19:26,353
- what was it that you wanted to say?
- Forget it

257
00:19:26,851 --> 00:19:28,626
You said it's hard to listen to my story

258
00:19:30,892 --> 00:19:32,744
You said my story made you feel crushed

259
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:36,710
After hearing that

260
00:19:36,981 --> 00:19:38,262
how can I talk about myself?

261
00:19:39,451 --> 00:19:40,876
Wouldn't that make me a scum?

262
00:19:41,293 --> 00:19:42,430
I...

263
00:19:44,721 --> 00:19:46,272
I said I'm sorry about that

264
00:19:49,627 --> 00:19:51,082
It's nothing to sorry about

265
00:19:52,502 --> 00:19:53,570
So...

266
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:55,504
think only about

267
00:19:55,505 --> 00:19:56,662
your problems

268
00:19:57,599 --> 00:19:59,376
That's suffocating enough...

269
00:20:00,258 --> 00:20:01,264
to be honest

270
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,334
I heard you hang out with them these days

271
00:20:10,902 --> 00:20:11,945
You know...

272
00:20:12,667 --> 00:20:13,920
what they are like

273
00:20:14,604 --> 00:20:15,706
What are they like?

274
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:18,585
What are they like?

275
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:22,899
How about us?

276
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,853
What are we?

277
00:20:29,018 --> 00:20:30,246
When we hung out

278
00:20:30,247 --> 00:20:31,861
people didn't see us favorably

279
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:34,750
For playing at the beach...

280
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:36,524
we were investigated

281
00:20:36,525 --> 00:20:37,570
at the police station...

282
00:20:37,728 --> 00:20:38,763
remember?

283
00:20:39,561 --> 00:20:40,602
Fine

284
00:20:42,294 --> 00:20:43,737
You don't have to see me...

285
00:20:45,387 --> 00:20:46,450
but don't do anything dangerous

286
00:20:46,451 --> 00:20:47,859
Go worry about yourself

287
00:20:48,774 --> 00:20:49,979
What's with your face?

288
00:20:50,311 --> 00:20:51,380
Answer me

289
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:54,460
Don't end up like Dohyeon!

290
00:20:59,732 --> 00:21:00,737
Go

291
00:21:00,738 --> 00:21:02,138
They don't like you that much

292
00:21:02,638 --> 00:21:03,671
Jooan

293
00:21:08,633 --> 00:21:09,720
Let's go!

294
00:21:33,374 --> 00:21:35,625
That bastard lives
in the container, right?

295
00:21:37,915 --> 00:21:38,991
What?

296
00:21:39,671 --> 00:21:40,702
Bastard?

297
00:21:42,117 --> 00:21:43,501
He's older than you, you bastard

298
00:21:46,404 --> 00:21:47,409
But...

299
00:21:47,963 --> 00:21:49,055
I saw that ba...

300
00:21:50,116 --> 00:21:51,177
saw him...

301
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:53,389
getting hit-and-run

302
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:57,029
What?

303
00:21:57,556 --> 00:21:58,572
At where?

304
00:21:58,945 --> 00:22:00,082
How did you get hurt?

305
00:22:00,247 --> 00:22:01,397
Well, I...

306
00:22:03,382 --> 00:22:04,469
I was going back

307
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:05,694
to the container last night

308
00:22:06,168 --> 00:22:07,246
There was a suspicious-looking car...

309
00:22:08,116 --> 00:22:09,124
so I went to check

310
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:10,272
but it drove towards me

311
00:22:11,262 --> 00:22:13,036
I tried to avoid it and fell

312
00:22:16,456 --> 00:22:17,926
Do you have to stay there?

313
00:22:18,996 --> 00:22:20,240
Can't you quit that job?

314
00:22:22,065 --> 00:22:23,243
To be honest...

315
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,125
after the incident last night

316
00:22:25,126 --> 00:22:26,230
I did want to quit

317
00:22:26,621 --> 00:22:27,632
Boss told me

318
00:22:27,633 --> 00:22:28,710
to work only until

319
00:22:28,711 --> 00:22:29,729
the end of this month anyway

320
00:22:30,072 --> 00:22:31,781
That's a long time

321
00:22:32,666 --> 00:22:33,678
You think you'll be alright?

322
00:22:34,181 --> 00:22:35,514
So from today onwards

323
00:22:35,515 --> 00:22:36,543
I'll sleep at home

324
00:22:36,831 --> 00:22:38,723
Boss doesn't come at midnight anyway...

325
00:22:39,022 --> 00:22:41,144
so I'll put up a dummy

326
00:22:43,914 --> 00:22:44,931
Hwan

327
00:22:45,206 --> 00:22:47,199
thanks for looking after me...

328
00:22:48,356 --> 00:22:49,380
but still, what's going on?

329
00:22:51,664 --> 00:22:52,887
I'm just worried about you

330
00:22:55,315 --> 00:22:57,715
If you have no other option,
you can stay in my house

331
00:22:59,271 --> 00:23:00,827
Ok. I will

332
00:23:01,791 --> 00:23:04,022
- Thanks. I'll get going
- Ok

333
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:42,781
Hwan

334
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:44,482
Where are you?

335
00:23:44,803 --> 00:23:45,830
Me?

336
00:23:46,484 --> 00:23:47,493
At the container

337
00:23:48,619 --> 00:23:49,879
You said you would sleep at home

338
00:23:50,229 --> 00:23:51,283
Why are you still there?

339
00:23:53,124 --> 00:23:54,175
I think I have to

340
00:23:54,176 --> 00:23:55,430
make it believable at least

341
00:23:56,603 --> 00:23:57,797
I'll leave after I'm done

342
00:23:58,885 --> 00:23:59,915
Why?

343
00:24:00,742 --> 00:24:02,532
No, I'm just worried about you

344
00:24:03,422 --> 00:24:04,720
You will sleep at home, right?

345
00:24:04,913 --> 00:24:05,998
Yeah, I will

346
00:24:06,876 --> 00:24:08,457
Don't worry, Hwan

347
00:24:08,971 --> 00:24:09,981
Good night

348
00:24:21,547 --> 00:24:23,008
Mr. Nohyeon Park

349
00:24:23,009 --> 00:24:24,921
quit due to personal reasons

350
00:24:25,684 --> 00:24:28,062
From next week, Mr. Daehyeon Lee

351
00:24:28,063 --> 00:24:30,251
will give you the make-up class

352
00:24:30,252 --> 00:24:31,905
We apologize for the inconvenience

353
00:24:31,906 --> 00:24:33,068
What the

354
00:24:33,931 --> 00:24:35,384
The exam is just a few days away

355
00:24:35,566 --> 00:24:36,580
Excuse me

356
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:39,204
What was his reason?

357
00:24:39,205 --> 00:24:40,376
That's personal

358
00:24:40,377 --> 00:24:41,406
so I can't answer you

359
00:24:41,407 --> 00:24:43,341
I'm sorry

360
00:25:05,206 --> 00:25:06,564
He suddenly quit

361
00:25:07,409 --> 00:25:08,468
When I mentioned you to him

362
00:25:08,469 --> 00:25:09,818
he wanted to meet you badly

363
00:25:09,819 --> 00:25:10,875
We'll continue

364
00:25:10,876 --> 00:25:13,171
with a mysterious case

365
00:25:13,172 --> 00:25:14,193
The suspect

366
00:25:14,194 --> 00:25:15,296
of a child attack

367
00:25:15,297 --> 00:25:17,032
in Songjoo nine years ago

368
00:25:17,033 --> 00:25:18,779
turned himself in recently

369
00:25:18,945 --> 00:25:20,312
and the investigation

370
00:25:20,313 --> 00:25:21,898
has been reignited

371
00:25:22,289 --> 00:25:23,558
I also remember that

372
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:25,918
a 12-year-old victim

373
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,810
couldn't testify due to shock

374
00:25:27,811 --> 00:25:29,703
It was difficult to investigate

375
00:25:29,704 --> 00:25:31,231
because there was no witness

376
00:25:31,449 --> 00:25:33,208
But the suspect, who turned himself in

377
00:25:33,502 --> 00:25:36,214
left a mysterious message

378
00:25:36,215 --> 00:25:37,789
that "Hide-and-seek's over"

379
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:39,098
Yes, you're right

380
00:25:39,167 --> 00:25:40,259
The real culprit

381
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,850
of the Grass Flower Arboretum child assault case

382
00:25:43,494 --> 00:25:45,026
nine years ago

383
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,261
came to the police

384
00:25:46,262 --> 00:25:48,443
a week ago when it rained

385
00:25:48,444 --> 00:25:49,662
heavily in Songjoo

386
00:25:50,117 --> 00:25:51,296
The culprit suddenly...

387
00:25:53,689 --> 00:25:54,908
Are you still there?

388
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:57,112
It's late at night

389
00:25:57,487 --> 00:25:58,546
Don't follow the news?

390
00:25:58,946 --> 00:26:00,031
Run home!

391
00:26:00,032 --> 00:26:01,384
I was about to leave

392
00:26:02,564 --> 00:26:03,700
I'll see you again tomorrow

393
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,693
Haru

394
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:11,046
I'll be back tomorrow...

395
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:12,409
ok?

396
00:26:32,704 --> 00:26:33,719
Hello

397
00:26:37,632 --> 00:26:39,069
It was you...

398
00:26:41,276 --> 00:26:42,344
who kept texting him

399
00:26:51,964 --> 00:26:53,048
Our Haru...

400
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:54,943
What should I do?

401
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:16,389
He doesn't talk

402
00:27:17,189 --> 00:27:18,263
He might...

403
00:27:20,103 --> 00:27:22,113
talk to you

404
00:27:44,271 --> 00:27:46,394
I guess you're surprised

405
00:27:48,609 --> 00:27:51,114
- Everything happened so suddenly that...
- Why did you do it?

406
00:27:53,208 --> 00:27:54,231
Sorry?

407
00:27:57,016 --> 00:27:58,088
Your wrist

408
00:28:01,168 --> 00:28:02,235
What did you do?

409
00:28:08,043 --> 00:28:09,052
You tried...

410
00:28:10,775 --> 00:28:11,831
to kill yourself?

411
00:28:12,695 --> 00:28:13,721
No

412
00:28:16,625 --> 00:28:17,861
Because I wanted to live

413
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,534
- I did it to survive
- How can you do that to survive?

414
00:28:30,318 --> 00:28:31,985
I'm sorry that I shouted

415
00:28:36,449 --> 00:28:37,495
Actually...

416
00:28:40,415 --> 00:28:41,663
you weren't coming to school

417
00:28:41,664 --> 00:28:42,761
and I couldn't reach you...

418
00:28:43,949 --> 00:28:45,650
so I was so worried about you

419
00:28:48,459 --> 00:28:49,679
On the other hand...

420
00:28:52,732 --> 00:28:53,890
what if you aren't answering my calls

421
00:28:53,891 --> 00:28:55,706
even when nothing's going on?

422
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,666
If that's the case...

423
00:29:03,018 --> 00:29:04,519
can I still wait for you...

424
00:29:06,998 --> 00:29:08,563
in front of your house?

425
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,637
I'm so lame, aren't I?

426
00:29:15,793 --> 00:29:16,916
It's all my fault...

427
00:29:18,849 --> 00:29:19,897
not yours

428
00:29:22,608 --> 00:29:23,766
It's not your fault

429
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:28,856
Whatever it was,
you did what you had to...

430
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:33,729
and you did the best you could do

431
00:29:40,936 --> 00:29:42,134
You said you trust me, right?

432
00:29:45,507 --> 00:29:46,652
I trust you, too...

433
00:29:50,123 --> 00:29:51,756
no matter what you tell me from now on

434
00:30:16,299 --> 00:30:17,746
It was a picnic day

435
00:30:21,334 --> 00:30:22,629
Actually, it wasn't...

436
00:30:24,985 --> 00:30:27,475
the best day for a picnic

437
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,181
It was so cloudy

438
00:30:36,056 --> 00:30:38,531
It was my first picnic

439
00:30:39,448 --> 00:30:41,880
as an elementary school student...

440
00:30:45,212 --> 00:30:46,303
so I was excited

441
00:31:00,015 --> 00:31:01,642
I followed a butterfly

442
00:31:01,643 --> 00:31:03,101
I had spotted

443
00:31:06,411 --> 00:31:07,951
Before I knew it, I was alone

444
00:31:16,832 --> 00:31:19,376
It was getting dark with rain clouds

445
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:21,405
and my friends and teacher...

446
00:31:22,902 --> 00:31:24,219
were nowhere to be found

447
00:31:26,506 --> 00:31:28,562
I think I cried because I was scared

448
00:31:32,654 --> 00:31:33,827
Right then

449
00:31:33,828 --> 00:31:35,578
it started to rain

450
00:31:37,582 --> 00:31:38,826
It was so dark...

451
00:31:39,394 --> 00:31:40,582
and I was so scared

452
00:31:41,854 --> 00:31:43,206
I didn't know where to go

453
00:31:45,223 --> 00:31:47,029
So I just ran forward

454
00:31:50,924 --> 00:31:52,654
Then I saw a building

455
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:55,476
It was the only place

456
00:31:55,477 --> 00:31:56,864
to hide from the rain

457
00:32:01,284 --> 00:32:02,301
But...

458
00:32:02,302 --> 00:32:04,871
Grass Flower Arboretum

459
00:32:04,872 --> 00:32:07,000
Strangely, I didn't want to go in

460
00:32:10,105 --> 00:32:11,663
At that moment...

461
00:32:35,477 --> 00:32:37,304
I saw something scarier

462
00:32:42,193 --> 00:32:44,097
A monster collecting...

463
00:32:49,319 --> 00:32:50,325
a child's tears

464
00:33:27,375 --> 00:33:28,406
I wanted to run

465
00:33:28,407 --> 00:33:29,455
but my feet froze

466
00:33:29,456 --> 00:33:31,050
and didn't move an inch

467
00:33:33,783 --> 00:33:34,898
The monster

468
00:33:34,899 --> 00:33:36,995
was walking towards me...

469
00:33:39,084 --> 00:33:40,751
but I couldn't move at all...

470
00:33:41,971 --> 00:33:43,217
not even a step

471
00:33:47,202 --> 00:33:48,291
You...

472
00:33:50,619 --> 00:33:52,703
will play hide-and-seek with me

473
00:33:58,899 --> 00:34:00,011
It...

474
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,972
begins now

475
00:34:10,922 --> 00:34:13,209
I ran and hid from the monster

476
00:34:14,697 --> 00:34:16,689
I was playing
hide-and-seek with the monster

477
00:34:27,447 --> 00:34:29,477
Whenever I close my eyes to sleep...

478
00:34:33,735 --> 00:34:35,301
I keep seeing...

479
00:34:36,034 --> 00:34:37,918
the eyes of the child I encountered

480
00:34:41,013 --> 00:34:42,072
What if...

481
00:34:45,507 --> 00:34:46,842
I didn't run away back then

482
00:34:47,277 --> 00:34:48,592
Anyone would've run away

483
00:34:49,753 --> 00:34:50,906
It's not your fault

484
00:34:52,391 --> 00:34:53,478
You're also a victim

485
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:54,853
You know this, right?

486
00:34:55,971 --> 00:34:57,576
So why do you hide here?

487
00:34:59,458 --> 00:35:01,080
Why do you hide here from that monster?

488
00:35:03,299 --> 00:35:04,333
No

489
00:35:05,281 --> 00:35:07,625
This time, I'm hiding from
something more terrifying

490
00:35:11,137 --> 00:35:12,176
"It"...

491
00:35:15,718 --> 00:35:16,786
has changed

492
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:27,110
I knew we'd meet again

493
00:35:29,283 --> 00:35:30,850
Like Noah waiting for...

494
00:35:31,245 --> 00:35:33,062
the Raven to return to the ark

495
00:35:34,034 --> 00:35:35,517
I was desperate for you

496
00:35:37,805 --> 00:35:38,859
I...

497
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:43,073
I shouldn't have hid from you

498
00:35:45,255 --> 00:35:46,734
It was me who hid

499
00:35:46,761 --> 00:35:47,802
You...

500
00:35:48,113 --> 00:35:49,873
have no idea how I waited...

501
00:35:50,717 --> 00:35:52,573
for this hide-and-seek to end

502
00:35:52,574 --> 00:35:54,064
and for you to come and find me

503
00:35:56,294 --> 00:35:57,344
Oh, you didn't realize?

504
00:35:58,185 --> 00:36:00,141
You were "it," not me

505
00:36:01,621 --> 00:36:03,806
But it took you so long

506
00:36:04,365 --> 00:36:05,462
Only if...

507
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:07,391
you had reported that day...

508
00:36:07,756 --> 00:36:09,527
this hide-and-seek would've ended at once

509
00:36:13,125 --> 00:36:14,268
Why...

510
00:36:16,133 --> 00:36:17,398
Why would I...

511
00:36:17,399 --> 00:36:18,670
You still don't know?

512
00:36:20,358 --> 00:36:22,153
Who could it be?

513
00:36:28,068 --> 00:36:29,560
Looking for Witnesses
The person who covered "its" eyes...

514
00:36:34,782 --> 00:36:35,794
Let's go

515
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:40,415
and made me hide

516
00:36:42,092 --> 00:36:43,645
While waiting to be recognized...

517
00:36:44,356 --> 00:36:45,547
I waited and watched you every day

518
00:36:45,548 --> 00:36:47,619
in front of your school...

519
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,658
but they even handed me the money...

520
00:36:50,495 --> 00:36:52,313
to beg me to keep hiding

521
00:37:03,626 --> 00:37:04,790
No

522
00:37:08,892 --> 00:37:10,033
My dad...

523
00:37:12,049 --> 00:37:13,207
My mom and dad...

524
00:37:17,176 --> 00:37:18,516
Why?

525
00:37:19,402 --> 00:37:20,497
No

526
00:37:22,883 --> 00:37:23,911
A tragedy...

527
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:25,734
always hatches that way...

528
00:37:27,045 --> 00:37:28,520
when those not worthy to be parents...

529
00:37:28,935 --> 00:37:30,685
become parents

530
00:37:39,458 --> 00:37:40,520
Right

531
00:37:42,788 --> 00:37:44,588
Be careful on your way home

532
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:48,794
From now on...

533
00:37:49,429 --> 00:37:51,462
a new hide-and-seek will begin

534
00:38:11,066 --> 00:38:12,647
Your parents are "it" from now on

535
00:38:12,648 --> 00:38:13,673
you fool

536
00:38:14,179 --> 00:38:15,579
Make a run for it!

537
00:38:31,641 --> 00:38:32,853
You're home?

538
00:38:39,219 --> 00:38:40,255
Haru

539
00:39:05,831 --> 00:39:06,847
Haru, what are you doing?

540
00:39:09,233 --> 00:39:11,436
Haru, did you get caught
in the rain again?

541
00:39:18,462 --> 00:39:19,933
Haru, why aren't you answering?

542
00:39:19,934 --> 00:39:21,403
You're making me frustrating

543
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:25,673
Haru Park!

544
00:39:26,827 --> 00:39:28,254
Haru! Haru...

545
00:39:48,831 --> 00:39:49,909
Haru

546
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:51,681
I'm going to open the door

547
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:36,322
I did it to survive

548
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,943
To protect myself

549
00:40:40,944 --> 00:40:42,645
I hid from that monster

550
00:40:47,335 --> 00:40:48,388
To protect...

551
00:40:52,715 --> 00:40:54,969
myself from more horrifying monsters

552
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:57,542
How...

553
00:41:00,445 --> 00:41:02,037
How can that be such parents?

554
00:41:04,018 --> 00:41:05,311
There are no such parents

555
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:07,951
Where in the hell are such parents?

556
00:41:10,078 --> 00:41:11,126
Parents are supposed to be...

557
00:41:12,054 --> 00:41:13,679
Mom and Dad are supposed to be...

558
00:41:19,217 --> 00:41:20,622
Don't trust what that madman told you

559
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:22,137
Maybe that bastard

560
00:41:22,138 --> 00:41:23,501
didn't turn himself in

561
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:27,032
I'll report to the police

562
00:41:27,893 --> 00:41:28,967
I'll put him to jail

563
00:41:28,968 --> 00:41:29,968
so he will never see you

564
00:41:29,969 --> 00:41:31,109
He already turned himself in

565
00:41:32,685 --> 00:41:34,105
You'll find out soon

566
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:38,466
Before you find it out

567
00:41:38,822 --> 00:41:40,776
on the news...

568
00:41:42,281 --> 00:41:43,407
I thought it'd be better to

569
00:41:43,408 --> 00:41:45,303
tell you myself

570
00:41:50,218 --> 00:41:51,257
What?

571
00:41:53,586 --> 00:41:54,621
Is there...

572
00:41:56,558 --> 00:41:57,978
something else I need to know?

573
00:42:05,669 --> 00:42:07,180
Do I...

574
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:13,697
know that monster?

575
00:42:17,598 --> 00:42:18,811
When he

576
00:42:18,812 --> 00:42:19,936
first came

577
00:42:19,937 --> 00:42:21,791
to the orphanage for the certificate

578
00:42:22,036 --> 00:42:23,038
he looked like a diligent

579
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:24,054
and likable guy

580
00:42:24,055 --> 00:42:25,853
- Excuse me, sir
- Huh?

581
00:42:25,854 --> 00:42:26,989
Yes, Hosu

582
00:42:27,305 --> 00:42:28,595
Could you...

583
00:42:29,685 --> 00:42:32,122
meet up with my friend?

584
00:42:32,261 --> 00:42:34,011
Of course. I'd be glad to

585
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:36,763
- Thank you
- No problem

586
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,753
One, two

587
00:43:17,619 --> 00:43:21,626
The 38th Songho Scholarship Foundation
Inauguration Ceremony

588
00:43:44,851 --> 00:43:46,812
As I already told you on our way...

589
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:48,971
scholars who're facing...

590
00:43:49,579 --> 00:43:51,276
economic difficulties...

591
00:43:52,052 --> 00:43:53,954
are sometimes linked with...

592
00:43:54,273 --> 00:43:56,336
their long-term sponsors here

593
00:43:56,668 --> 00:43:58,605
That's why I thought

594
00:43:58,606 --> 00:44:00,673
it'd be a good opportunity for you...

595
00:44:01,201 --> 00:44:02,657
and called you...

596
00:44:03,033 --> 00:44:04,096
Will you be ok?

597
00:44:04,097 --> 00:44:05,604
Scholar Dogeon Kim /
Scholarship Foundation Sponsor Changjun Kim

598
00:44:05,605 --> 00:44:07,346
Of course, I'm grateful

599
00:44:08,129 --> 00:44:09,136
I'm already grateful that

600
00:44:09,137 --> 00:44:10,732
you chose me as a scholar again...

601
00:44:11,874 --> 00:44:13,252
topped off with this opportunity...

602
00:44:16,223 --> 00:44:17,362
Thank you so much

603
00:44:17,708 --> 00:44:18,735
No problem

604
00:44:20,965 --> 00:44:22,283
Oh, here he comes

605
00:44:27,669 --> 00:44:29,524
- Hello
- It's him

606
00:44:31,703 --> 00:44:32,921
Oh, Dogeon Kim

607
00:44:33,478 --> 00:44:35,103
I heard a lot about you from Principal Jo

608
00:44:35,104 --> 00:44:36,177
What do you mean?

609
00:44:36,178 --> 00:44:38,296
You already knew a lot about him

610
00:44:38,835 --> 00:44:41,179
He's very close with your son as well

611
00:44:43,804 --> 00:44:45,103
Call it an act of providence

612
00:44:52,278 --> 00:44:53,320
Go ahead and answer it

613
00:44:53,890 --> 00:44:54,968
It's your mother

614
00:44:56,347 --> 00:44:57,403
It's ok

615
00:45:01,438 --> 00:45:03,863
Excuse me

616
00:45:17,918 --> 00:45:18,943
Yes, mom

617
00:45:20,741 --> 00:45:21,897
I'll be late today

618
00:45:23,489 --> 00:45:24,548
No

619
00:45:25,578 --> 00:45:27,690
I'm at the scholarship event

620
00:45:28,969 --> 00:45:30,152
Mr. Kim

621
00:45:30,153 --> 00:45:32,011
will be late today, right?

622
00:45:32,012 --> 00:45:33,513
Yes, I believe

623
00:45:33,514 --> 00:45:34,800
the scholarship event will end late

624
00:45:34,965 --> 00:45:36,567
He won't be eating,
so you can go off early

625
00:45:37,851 --> 00:45:39,101
I'll end work at my own accord

626
00:45:47,274 --> 00:45:49,326
Why are you eating like a bird?

627
00:45:50,165 --> 00:45:51,414
You're too skinny these days

628
00:45:53,029 --> 00:45:54,120
I don't feel like eating

629
00:45:58,083 --> 00:45:59,890
Why didn't you go with my dad?

630
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:03,244
It's not that I didn't, I couldn't

631
00:46:04,253 --> 00:46:05,432
Mr. Kim goes to places

632
00:46:05,433 --> 00:46:07,096
without me these days

633
00:46:08,318 --> 00:46:09,331
Hey, Hwan

634
00:46:10,287 --> 00:46:11,520
If you get successful in the future

635
00:46:11,879 --> 00:46:13,768
don't forget about me, ok?

636
00:46:14,864 --> 00:46:16,716
It's hard juggling between you and Mr. Kim

637
00:46:17,830 --> 00:46:18,924
Plus, I'm looking after

638
00:46:18,925 --> 00:46:19,939
your friend, too

639
00:46:21,429 --> 00:46:23,732
That friend who lives in the container

640
00:46:25,141 --> 00:46:26,325
I'm looking out for him

641
00:46:27,192 --> 00:46:28,213
Thank you

642
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:31,605
Not at all

643
00:46:35,919 --> 00:46:38,358
I really want you to do well

644
00:46:40,768 --> 00:46:42,821
If only you get elected here...

645
00:46:45,514 --> 00:46:47,048
there's nothing more I can wish for

646
00:46:54,432 --> 00:46:55,514
What a busy guy

647
00:46:55,883 --> 00:46:56,929
You're so busy

648
00:47:12,024 --> 00:47:13,386
Well done today

649
00:47:13,904 --> 00:47:14,990
Going around...

650
00:47:15,256 --> 00:47:17,298
greeting everyone is the hardest part

651
00:47:18,734 --> 00:47:19,759
It was nothing

652
00:47:20,669 --> 00:47:22,953
It's past ten. You must be tired

653
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:25,562
It'll take a while. Have a nap

654
00:47:25,805 --> 00:47:27,056
We'll wake you up when we're there

655
00:47:28,222 --> 00:47:30,019
No, I'm fine

656
00:47:58,648 --> 00:48:00,088
Why isn't he coming?

657
00:48:01,829 --> 00:48:03,314
Is he not coming today?

658
00:48:20,826 --> 00:48:21,884
Dogeon

659
00:48:25,134 --> 00:48:26,181
Dogeon

660
00:48:31,309 --> 00:48:32,395
We've arrived

661
00:48:32,552 --> 00:48:33,903
Looks like you are very tired

662
00:48:33,969 --> 00:48:34,979
Ah...

663
00:48:36,493 --> 00:48:37,564
I'm sorry

664
00:48:39,009 --> 00:48:40,326
I slept...

665
00:48:45,167 --> 00:48:47,306
- Here...
- What's wrong?

666
00:48:48,438 --> 00:48:50,685
I know you normally stay here

667
00:48:51,006 --> 00:48:52,015
No?

668
00:48:52,834 --> 00:48:53,871
Sorry?

669
00:48:56,947 --> 00:48:57,972
Ah...

670
00:49:01,256 --> 00:49:02,273
Nothing

671
00:49:02,842 --> 00:49:04,803
Thank you for giving me a ride

672
00:49:15,076 --> 00:49:16,081
Good night

673
00:49:19,807 --> 00:49:21,868
He looks like a good kid

674
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:25,223
He's smart as well

675
00:49:25,916 --> 00:49:27,362
As smart as Hwan Kim

676
00:49:37,687 --> 00:49:38,799
Dogeon...

677
00:49:40,315 --> 00:49:41,579
is a talent...

678
00:49:42,433 --> 00:49:44,876
beneficial to society in many ways

679
00:49:45,521 --> 00:49:46,727
It's all thanks

680
00:49:46,728 --> 00:49:48,685
to your guidance

681
00:49:52,053 --> 00:49:53,197
Memorial service...

682
00:49:56,141 --> 00:49:57,650
Prepare for it

683
00:50:20,651 --> 00:50:21,668
Yes, sir

684
00:50:23,786 --> 00:50:24,810
Today?

685
00:50:26,061 --> 00:50:27,213
Right now?

686
00:50:28,504 --> 00:50:29,892
Why at this late hour?

687
00:50:32,096 --> 00:50:33,153
Yes, understood

688
00:50:43,404 --> 00:50:44,633
Yes, head out now

689
00:50:45,731 --> 00:50:46,783
Yes, right now

690
00:50:47,807 --> 00:50:48,874
I don't know why

691
00:50:48,875 --> 00:50:49,895
Just head out now

692
00:50:54,322 --> 00:50:55,359
You weren't sleeping?

693
00:50:55,891 --> 00:50:56,997
Go to bed

694
00:50:57,997 --> 00:50:59,108
What's going on?

695
00:51:05,081 --> 00:51:06,839
That friend who lives in the container

696
00:51:07,618 --> 00:51:08,950
Tell him to get out of there this instant

697
00:51:16,721 --> 00:51:18,141
Please leave a message after the tone...

698
00:51:30,475 --> 00:51:31,755
Why isn't he picking up?

699
00:51:57,981 --> 00:51:59,010
Yes, what's up?

700
00:51:59,575 --> 00:52:00,592
Where are you?

701
00:52:01,276 --> 00:52:03,417
I'm outside for a while. Why?

702
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,647
I...

703
00:52:06,145 --> 00:52:07,804
I hit your dad little bit

704
00:52:08,949 --> 00:52:10,042
What?

705
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,129
You did what?

706
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:14,330
I hit your dad little bit

707
00:52:15,112 --> 00:52:16,924
You piece of shit, what are you saying?

708
00:52:17,044 --> 00:52:18,123
You moron

709
00:52:18,124 --> 00:52:20,271
If it weren't for me, your sister's dead

710
00:52:20,524 --> 00:52:22,380
Your sister was running barefoot

711
00:52:22,381 --> 00:52:24,191
because your dad was chasing after her

712
00:52:24,192 --> 00:52:25,562
to the entrance to kill her

713
00:52:25,563 --> 00:52:26,827
- Shit
- So with the helmet

714
00:52:26,828 --> 00:52:27,829
I struck him once

715
00:52:27,830 --> 00:52:28,893
I didn't hit him hard

716
00:52:28,894 --> 00:52:30,437
- I'm not joking
- Darn it!

717
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,535
You just wait there

718
00:52:35,204 --> 00:52:36,552
I'll kill you if you run away

719
00:52:37,162 --> 00:52:39,099
Should I have left your sister dead then?

720
00:52:39,943 --> 00:52:40,954
If I'm being beaten up

721
00:52:40,955 --> 00:52:41,990
are you going to turn a blind eye?

722
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:44,581
Be honest with me...

723
00:52:44,973 --> 00:52:46,350
you never wanted to beat your dad?

724
00:52:46,908 --> 00:52:48,720
You wanted it, too

725
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:50,359
Frankly speaking...

726
00:52:50,864 --> 00:52:52,340
I did the job for you

727
00:52:56,265 --> 00:52:57,633
This piece of shit

728
00:53:24,751 --> 00:53:25,820
What?

729
00:53:26,927 --> 00:53:28,479
Why are you coming home so late?

730
00:53:31,702 --> 00:53:32,771
Did you hit...

731
00:53:34,602 --> 00:53:35,736
my sister again?

732
00:53:38,631 --> 00:53:39,657
Why did you hit her?

733
00:53:43,137 --> 00:53:44,189
Tea

734
00:53:44,990 --> 00:53:46,053
Tea

735
00:53:47,056 --> 00:53:49,159
She came to leave it
when I was not around...

736
00:53:49,952 --> 00:53:51,311
but I caught her

737
00:53:52,190 --> 00:53:53,296
That bitch

738
00:53:54,672 --> 00:53:56,549
She's just like your mom

739
00:53:57,742 --> 00:53:58,988
You too, just leave

740
00:54:01,034 --> 00:54:02,375
I'm sick of...

741
00:54:02,704 --> 00:54:04,230
all of you...

742
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:05,649
waiting for me to die

743
00:54:07,868 --> 00:54:09,059
I asked you...

744
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:12,635
why you hit her

745
00:54:14,819 --> 00:54:17,063
I'm asking you why you hit her

746
00:54:19,861 --> 00:54:21,223
This jerk

747
00:54:21,811 --> 00:54:22,873
What did you say?

748
00:54:23,347 --> 00:54:24,388
Apologize...

749
00:54:27,856 --> 00:54:29,320
to Mom...

750
00:54:30,172 --> 00:54:31,491
to Sis...

751
00:54:34,254 --> 00:54:36,005
Say that you're sorry

752
00:54:40,574 --> 00:54:42,701
Apologize to Mom...

753
00:54:45,026 --> 00:54:47,079
for hitting her whenever you're drunk...

754
00:54:48,781 --> 00:54:49,905
and forcing her to run away

755
00:54:52,492 --> 00:54:53,552
Apologize...

756
00:54:54,830 --> 00:54:56,158
to Sis for not letting her...

757
00:54:57,268 --> 00:54:59,450
to wear short sleeves even in summer...

758
00:55:02,848 --> 00:55:04,474
because of her bruises

759
00:55:06,177 --> 00:55:07,220
Ok?

760
00:55:08,737 --> 00:55:09,890
Dad

761
00:55:11,038 --> 00:55:12,440
My ear

762
00:55:14,437 --> 00:55:16,078
My ear!

763
00:55:19,375 --> 00:55:21,953
Apologize for making...

764
00:55:24,890 --> 00:55:26,079
my one ear...

765
00:55:28,114 --> 00:55:29,162
deaf

766
00:55:31,510 --> 00:55:32,572
Go ahead

767
00:55:36,950 --> 00:55:39,296
Say that you're sorry!

768
00:55:44,978 --> 00:55:46,047
Please

769
00:55:49,611 --> 00:55:50,873
Please

770
00:55:52,629 --> 00:55:54,681
Please!

771
00:55:54,682 --> 00:55:56,143
Shut up!

772
00:56:12,376 --> 00:56:13,908
Sis, don't come home ever again

773
00:56:16,183 --> 00:56:17,213
Dad...

774
00:56:19,891 --> 00:56:21,404
doesn't exist from today onwards

775
00:56:32,635 --> 00:56:34,080
Please leave your...

776
00:56:57,683 --> 00:56:59,071
- Hey, Dogeon
- Yes, Hwan

777
00:56:59,275 --> 00:57:00,954
You called me? I was sleeping

778
00:57:00,955 --> 00:57:02,163
Why didn't you pick up your phone?

779
00:57:02,785 --> 00:57:03,823
Where are you?

780
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:06,360
- Me?
- Not at the container, right?

781
00:57:06,361 --> 00:57:07,548
You're home, right?

782
00:57:07,668 --> 00:57:09,591
I'm at the container. Why?

783
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:11,004
Why are you at the container?

784
00:57:11,005 --> 00:57:12,136
You said you'll sleep at home

785
00:57:12,271 --> 00:57:14,229
I had to go somewhere

786
00:57:15,667 --> 00:57:17,372
- But, Hwan
- Come out of there right now

787
00:57:17,461 --> 00:57:19,683
- Why are you upset?
- Come out! They'll set a fire...

788
00:57:33,807 --> 00:57:34,828
Are you ok?

789
00:57:34,948 --> 00:57:36,293
- Dogeon
- Are you ok?

790
00:57:36,294 --> 00:57:37,477
Hey, Dogeon

791
00:57:37,552 --> 00:57:38,605
Dogeon

792
00:58:22,482 --> 00:58:24,709
Dogeon, Dogeon

793
00:58:58,952 --> 00:59:00,048
Dogeon

794
00:59:00,049 --> 00:59:01,567
- Hwan
- Dogeon!

795
00:59:03,095 --> 00:59:04,894
- Dogeon!
- Hwan

796
00:59:04,895 --> 00:59:05,932
Dogeon!

797
00:59:05,933 --> 00:59:06,979
Hwan

798
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:08,276
Hwan!

799
00:59:10,584 --> 00:59:11,586
Dogeon

800
00:59:13,964 --> 00:59:15,044
Hey

801
00:59:15,513 --> 00:59:17,097
I thought you were dead

802
00:59:24,652 --> 00:59:25,701
You...

803
00:59:26,247 --> 00:59:27,773
You called and told me to...

804
00:59:28,848 --> 00:59:29,981
come out

805
00:59:30,936 --> 00:59:31,976
Hello?

806
00:59:32,723 --> 00:59:33,743
Hwan

807
00:59:36,151 --> 00:59:37,161
What the

808
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:03,103
Oppose the redevelopment!
Stabilizing the people's lives should come first!

809
01:00:45,446 --> 01:00:47,090
I've been feeling insecure

810
01:00:48,103 --> 01:00:50,253
Since the banner about
the redevelopment was up

811
01:00:50,661 --> 01:00:52,271
there were suspicious cars and people

812
01:00:57,030 --> 01:00:58,054
If you hadn't called me

813
01:00:58,055 --> 01:00:59,074
and woken me up...

814
01:01:03,241 --> 01:01:04,312
I feel giddy thinking about it

815
01:01:04,572 --> 01:01:06,384
You called him to come out?

816
01:01:08,312 --> 01:01:09,825
Did you know it would be on fire?

817
01:01:13,114 --> 01:01:15,557
Before the call was disconnected...

818
01:01:16,570 --> 01:01:17,872
he did say...

819
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:19,768
something about the fire

820
01:01:23,442 --> 01:01:24,623
How did you know about the fire

821
01:01:24,624 --> 01:01:25,660
in advance?

822
01:01:29,008 --> 01:01:31,238
- I...
- You knew?

823
01:01:33,215 --> 01:01:34,246
Right?

824
01:01:38,802 --> 01:01:40,181
Hey, Jooan

825
01:01:40,182 --> 01:01:41,520
Answer me, you bastard

826
01:01:41,687 --> 01:01:42,732
Hey, Jooan Kim

827
01:01:42,733 --> 01:01:43,734
He's our friend

828
01:01:43,929 --> 01:01:45,315
Answer me

829
01:01:46,065 --> 01:01:47,228
Why can't you answer me?

830
01:01:47,547 --> 01:01:49,723
I asked you whether you knew

831
01:01:50,465 --> 01:01:52,454
- I'm sorry
- Stop

832
01:01:52,594 --> 01:01:54,711
- I said stop
- Why?

833
01:01:55,392 --> 01:01:56,544
You were about to be

834
01:01:56,545 --> 01:01:58,377
barbecued in the fire. Why stop?

835
01:01:59,026 --> 01:02:00,146
He said he's sorry

836
01:02:01,662 --> 01:02:03,989
That means he knew everything,
but didn't tell us

837
01:02:03,990 --> 01:02:05,037
I didn't die

838
01:02:06,531 --> 01:02:07,701
That's all it matters

839
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:10,555
I survived because he called me

840
01:02:16,346 --> 01:02:17,426
So you're thankful?

841
01:02:17,858 --> 01:02:19,060
You're thankful that he saved you?

842
01:02:20,377 --> 01:02:22,525
Deep down,
you're angry and frustrated, too

843
01:02:22,870 --> 01:02:23,870
Who should we

844
01:02:23,871 --> 01:02:24,956
pour this out to?

845
01:02:26,194 --> 01:02:27,778
Who's fault is it

846
01:02:27,779 --> 01:02:28,943
that we're always...

847
01:02:31,034 --> 01:02:32,999
in this shitty situation?

848
01:02:38,670 --> 01:02:40,470
As soon as our lives
turn for the better...

849
01:02:44,721 --> 01:02:46,188
something always comes up

850
01:02:49,827 --> 01:02:52,485
There will always be something

851
01:02:58,059 --> 01:02:59,077
I feel like we picked...

852
01:02:59,078 --> 01:03:00,754
all the blanks there were...

853
01:03:03,689 --> 01:03:05,039
but why are there more?

854
01:03:06,101 --> 01:03:07,605
Perhaps the box we're holding...

855
01:03:09,203 --> 01:03:11,004
only has blanks inside

856
01:03:21,158 --> 01:03:23,623
Things would rather be better
when they keep being shitty

857
01:03:24,468 --> 01:03:25,716
I can't do this anymore...

858
01:03:27,695 --> 01:03:28,780
not this

859
01:03:34,875 --> 01:03:35,883
Hey, Jooan

860
01:03:37,964 --> 01:03:38,965
Jooan Kim

861
01:04:21,140 --> 01:04:22,292
Mr. Kim

862
01:04:22,488 --> 01:04:23,574
Mr. Kim

863
01:04:23,575 --> 01:04:25,048
As planned, Songjoo Ilbo will publish

864
01:04:25,282 --> 01:04:26,428
an article suspecting the landowner

865
01:04:26,429 --> 01:04:28,023
of a self-fabricated scenario

866
01:04:28,489 --> 01:04:29,518
And it seems like

867
01:04:29,519 --> 01:04:30,717
the national newspaper's onto something

868
01:04:30,986 --> 01:04:32,741
They called us, but I didn't answer

869
01:04:33,226 --> 01:04:34,231
The principal Jo also said

870
01:04:34,232 --> 01:04:35,726
he will use every connection he has

871
01:04:35,863 --> 01:04:37,548
to take care of this business

872
01:04:37,937 --> 01:04:39,500
There won't be any problem
regarding the redevelopment

873
01:04:39,891 --> 01:04:40,925
Mr. Kim

874
01:04:40,967 --> 01:04:42,088
Mr. Kim

875
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:43,726
Mr. Kim

876
01:04:51,093 --> 01:04:52,119
Hwan Kim

877
01:04:54,296 --> 01:04:55,322
Was it you?

878
01:04:57,940 --> 01:04:58,980
Answer me

879
01:05:00,019 --> 01:05:02,385
Answer me. Did you tell him?

880
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:05,871
What if I did tell him?

881
01:05:09,771 --> 01:05:10,910
What are you going to do?

882
01:05:14,696 --> 01:05:15,770
You...

883
01:05:18,872 --> 01:05:20,789
think your son's very brave

884
01:05:24,447 --> 01:05:25,826
I don't have such courage

885
01:05:33,679 --> 01:05:35,521
Please send me back to the States

886
01:05:35,522 --> 01:05:36,563
I...

887
01:05:37,701 --> 01:05:40,250
told you to act and live up to my name

888
01:05:42,047 --> 01:05:43,269
I'm too scared

889
01:05:49,696 --> 01:05:50,827
I'm scared...

890
01:05:54,087 --> 01:05:55,635
that I might turn out like you

891
01:05:57,616 --> 01:05:59,011
It's horrifying

892
01:06:06,424 --> 01:06:07,424
Cein's Apartment

893
01:06:21,569 --> 01:06:22,580
Here, please

894
01:06:25,461 --> 01:06:27,197
- Please take this as well
- Ok

895
01:06:36,851 --> 01:06:38,415
Oh, nice shot

896
01:06:38,416 --> 01:06:39,453
Nice shot

897
01:06:39,804 --> 01:06:40,867
Jeha

898
01:06:44,549 --> 01:06:45,581
Jeha

899
01:06:47,087 --> 01:06:48,109
Yes

900
01:07:10,689 --> 01:07:12,548
- Oh, nice shot
- Nice shot

901
01:07:34,511 --> 01:07:35,516
Sir

902
01:07:35,993 --> 01:07:37,012
Is your son not here yet?

903
01:07:37,848 --> 01:07:39,554
We need to get going

904
01:07:40,785 --> 01:07:41,897
Oh, yes

905
01:07:42,432 --> 01:07:43,437
I'm sorry

906
01:07:46,686 --> 01:07:48,202
Oh, here he comes

907
01:07:48,643 --> 01:07:49,859
- You can start the engine
- Oh, yes

908
01:07:59,595 --> 01:08:00,749
Did you go there again?

909
01:08:02,845 --> 01:08:03,873
Let's go

910
01:08:06,246 --> 01:08:07,247
Let's go

911
01:09:24,256 --> 01:09:25,269
Goodbye

912
01:09:44,983 --> 01:09:46,004
What are you doing here?

913
01:09:46,870 --> 01:09:47,984
Should've called me when you got here

914
01:09:48,835 --> 01:09:49,879
Sorry

915
01:09:52,071 --> 01:09:53,276
I knew...

916
01:09:55,368 --> 01:09:56,749
that that place would be on fire

917
01:09:59,243 --> 01:10:00,256
But...

918
01:10:01,785 --> 01:10:02,790
It's ok

919
01:10:05,027 --> 01:10:07,058
You worried about me way before that

920
01:10:07,945 --> 01:10:08,980
And...

921
01:10:09,604 --> 01:10:11,243
it was you who called me...

922
01:10:12,207 --> 01:10:13,257
and came

923
01:10:14,618 --> 01:10:15,667
Thanks to you...

924
01:10:17,730 --> 01:10:19,002
I'm alive

925
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:22,242
I'm sorry for everything

926
01:10:24,209 --> 01:10:25,349
I knew that...

927
01:10:26,402 --> 01:10:27,841
you had to move...

928
01:10:28,701 --> 01:10:29,892
if this place got redeveloped

929
01:10:34,246 --> 01:10:35,631
Why do you apologize...

930
01:10:37,326 --> 01:10:38,688
for how I live?

931
01:10:40,590 --> 01:10:42,060
I'm living my life

932
01:10:42,061 --> 01:10:43,135
as it's given to me

933
01:10:45,456 --> 01:10:46,712
And so are you

934
01:10:48,512 --> 01:10:50,030
Why do we have to feel sorry for that?

935
01:10:53,821 --> 01:10:54,887
If...

936
01:10:55,752 --> 01:10:57,340
I move and transfer to another school...

937
01:10:58,225 --> 01:10:59,769
take care of the guys for me...

938
01:11:00,684 --> 01:11:01,737
especially Jooan

939
01:11:02,663 --> 01:11:04,193
He talks tough, but...

940
01:11:04,970 --> 01:11:06,568
- he's a nice guy
- I'm leaving...

941
01:11:09,036 --> 01:11:10,059
for America

942
01:11:12,787 --> 01:11:13,934
All of a sudden?

943
01:11:16,512 --> 01:11:19,202
Are you going back to your old school?

944
01:11:20,768 --> 01:11:21,840
Jeha said...

945
01:11:24,907 --> 01:11:26,239
I'll become like my dad

946
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:27,436
when I grow up

947
01:11:30,743 --> 01:11:31,973
I think he's right

948
01:11:35,228 --> 01:11:36,279
Hwan

949
01:11:36,775 --> 01:11:37,777
If you're...

950
01:11:38,331 --> 01:11:40,396
feeling sorry for what happened...

951
01:11:43,424 --> 01:11:44,615
I'm really fine

952
01:11:50,179 --> 01:11:51,229
It's not because I'm sorry

953
01:11:54,431 --> 01:11:55,566
I'm running away

954
01:11:58,679 --> 01:11:59,686
I'm...

955
01:12:01,634 --> 01:12:03,392
