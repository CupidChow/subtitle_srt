00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,300
Child actors and animals were filmed
in safe conditions under the supervision of their guardians.

3
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,205
Piano bro

4
00:02:37,502 --> 00:02:38,986
Ah, what the heck

5
00:02:44,087 --> 00:02:45,187
Ah!

6
00:02:46,983 --> 00:02:48,213
Darn it

7
00:03:19,888 --> 00:03:21,250
Kitty

8
00:03:23,215 --> 00:03:24,485
Kitty

9
00:03:26,284 --> 00:03:27,542
Kitty

10
00:03:32,542 --> 00:03:33,973
Kitty, come here

11
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:37,160
Come here

12
00:03:39,994 --> 00:03:41,105
Hello

13
00:04:15,836 --> 00:04:17,708
You look good

14
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:19,495
It seems like
you like your new school after transferring

15
00:04:20,113 --> 00:04:21,500
Yes, I like it

16
00:04:22,397 --> 00:04:24,042
I've made some friends

17
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,205
Some of them are younger and older than me

18
00:04:26,207 --> 00:04:28,540
One of them, who's good at dancing,

19
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:30,276
walks me home

20
00:04:32,437 --> 00:04:33,700
That's good to hear

21
00:04:34,752 --> 00:04:36,323
Hmm, then

22
00:04:37,304 --> 00:04:39,222
How about your memory of that time?

23
00:04:40,024 --> 00:04:41,680
Do you still not remember anything at all?

24
00:04:42,218 --> 00:04:45,286
Or has anything changed?

25
00:04:49,228 --> 00:04:50,447
No

26
00:04:52,149 --> 00:04:53,959
I don't remember, at all

27
00:04:58,874 --> 00:05:00,084
Thank you

28
00:05:01,911 --> 00:05:04,087
Haru, did you answer well?

29
00:05:05,433 --> 00:05:06,786
What did you say?

30
00:05:07,566 --> 00:05:08,859
Tell me about it

31
00:05:11,655 --> 00:05:12,853
Just...

32
00:05:14,223 --> 00:05:15,790
Huh? Haru!

33
00:05:17,774 --> 00:05:19,033
Hello

34
00:05:20,363 --> 00:05:21,655
What brings you here?

35
00:05:24,754 --> 00:05:27,815
Oh, I came to see a doctor

36
00:05:28,432 --> 00:05:29,964
But why are you here?

37
00:05:30,422 --> 00:05:32,613
I came to get counseling and
to pick up some medication...

38
00:05:34,552 --> 00:05:36,138
For my narcolepsy, you know

39
00:05:39,996 --> 00:05:41,719
Then, take care

40
00:05:42,603 --> 00:05:43,859
Let's go

41
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:46,435
Goodbye

42
00:05:47,155 --> 00:05:48,428
Bye, Haru

43
00:05:57,172 --> 00:05:58,802
I'm Hosu Jeong

44
00:05:59,763 --> 00:06:02,085
- Yes, please wait a moment
-Okay

45
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:09,819
Haru Park?

46
00:06:16,017 --> 00:06:18,231
Haru Park?

47
00:06:19,931 --> 00:06:22,373
The prescription is ready,
where did he go?

48
00:06:27,297 --> 00:06:30,247
Psychiatric Clinic

49
00:06:30,248 --> 00:06:32,847
How did we just happen to meet here, huh?

50
00:06:33,828 --> 00:06:38,240
- Tell him it was because of my insomnia, got it?
- Yes

51
00:06:39,221 --> 00:06:40,770
So you have to
transfer to another school again?

52
00:06:41,459 --> 00:06:44,245
I thought I could finally settle in

53
00:06:45,777 --> 00:06:46,987
I'm sorry

54
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:57,445
- How come you guys come to school like that...!
- I'm sorry

55
00:06:58,607 --> 00:07:00,393
- Say hello to the principal
- Hello

56
00:07:02,225 --> 00:07:04,489
Go in, you need to come up
on the sidewalk, on the sidewalk!

57
00:07:04,941 --> 00:07:06,908
Give me the ball!

58
00:07:06,909 --> 00:07:08,227
Ball!

59
00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:09,482
Go up on the sidewalk!

60
00:07:10,082 --> 00:07:11,374
I said, go up on the sidewalk!

61
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:12,552
Say hello to the principal!

62
00:07:15,965 --> 00:07:17,601
Walk on the sidewalk, on the sidewalk!

63
00:07:19,042 --> 00:07:20,324
Go up on the sidewalk, everyone

64
00:07:20,942 --> 00:07:22,228
Go up, quickly!

65
00:07:27,495 --> 00:07:28,823
You know my mom, right?

66
00:07:38,288 --> 00:07:39,531
I know

67
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,766
Is there anyone in this neighborhood
who doesn't know about that incident?

68
00:07:43,217 --> 00:07:44,772
The fire was so big...

69
00:07:45,477 --> 00:07:48,717
Because of that incident,
you became famous too

70
00:07:53,217 --> 00:07:56,101
It seems like Hwan Kim and you
have been hanging out together recently

71
00:07:57,158 --> 00:07:59,155
Hwan is a good student

72
00:08:01,034 --> 00:08:02,117
Yes

73
00:08:03,682 --> 00:08:05,139
He seems nice

74
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,313
Don't corrupt an innocent student

75
00:08:09,314 --> 00:08:11,077
I hope you don't stir up trouble at school

76
00:08:11,681 --> 00:08:14,301
Because my students are
the most precious to me

77
00:08:23,747 --> 00:08:24,905
This is advice, right?

78
00:08:25,444 --> 00:08:26,704
Not a warning

79
00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:34,135
Your father said

80
00:08:35,218 --> 00:08:38,457
Cein is smart
but doesn't put in the effort

81
00:08:39,615 --> 00:08:41,336
Seems like that is true

82
00:08:47,314 --> 00:08:49,374
Hey, Cein Min!
Aren't you going to say hello?

83
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:52,254
- You're here
- Hey

84
00:08:57,148 --> 00:08:58,413
Let's go

85
00:08:59,925 --> 00:09:01,136
Hey!

86
00:09:01,497 --> 00:09:02,679
Hey!

87
00:09:04,732 --> 00:09:05,911
Hey, Cein Min!

88
00:09:06,789 --> 00:09:07,961
Hey, dude!

89
00:09:10,607 --> 00:09:13,078
Hey, you have four more weeks of
getting detention, got it?

90
00:09:13,699 --> 00:09:15,255
You're extended for another four weeks!

91
00:09:18,065 --> 00:09:20,256
- Walk on the sidewalk, on the sidewalk!
- Hwan

92
00:09:20,257 --> 00:09:21,437
Huh?

93
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,744
You know the principal well, right?

94
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:27,911
My dad knows him well more than I do

95
00:09:28,783 --> 00:09:31,143
He was my father's
homeroom teacher in high school

96
00:09:32,124 --> 00:09:33,847
Ah, I see

97
00:09:34,922 --> 00:09:37,264
Being from the same Songho Scholarship Foundation,
they must know each other well

98
00:09:38,276 --> 00:09:39,292
Who?

99
00:09:40,236 --> 00:09:41,986
Who's from the same scholarship foundation?

100
00:09:42,347 --> 00:09:44,506
Oh, someone I know

101
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:47,567
Hwan

102
00:09:48,365 --> 00:09:50,637
Can I come over to your house someday?

103
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:55,667
Well, I also want to see
what a rich house looks like

104
00:09:57,913 --> 00:10:00,094
Uh, well, some other time

105
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:18,899
That reflection in the mirror is Haru Park

106
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,218
Psycho cockroach bastard

107
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:21,989
He's been hiding
in Songjoo Jeil Middle School

108
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:27,308
Jooan's trembling is totally severe

109
00:10:28,906 --> 00:10:30,340
- I'm going crazy, really
- I told you

110
00:10:30,341 --> 00:10:31,551
It's not that I didn't know

111
00:10:31,552 --> 00:10:34,065
I know everything,
it's just that my brain works too fast...

112
00:10:34,405 --> 00:10:36,035
If that's the case, then I'm even quicker

113
00:10:36,738 --> 00:10:39,095
Anyway,
the message was all delivered, wasn't it?

114
00:10:39,715 --> 00:10:41,434
Really annoying,
I'm not hanging out with you

115
00:10:48,082 --> 00:10:49,625
Isn't he so funny?

116
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:59,586
Hosu,
about running into you there yesterday...

117
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,445
My mom has some serious insomnia

118
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:10,181
I mean, I also didn't expect to
run into you there yesterday...

119
00:11:10,182 --> 00:11:11,624
I must have had
a really weird expression, right?

120
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:14,350
Honestly, who would have thought
to meet anyone there?

121
00:11:14,351 --> 00:11:16,121
Who would've even imagined that, right?

122
00:11:16,122 --> 00:11:17,928
I was really surprised...

123
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:20,698
I'm sorry

124
00:11:20,699 --> 00:11:21,999
No, it's okay

125
00:11:22,344 --> 00:11:23,794
I was shocked too

126
00:11:23,795 --> 00:11:25,028
Hey, Haru

127
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:27,654
- Are you really going to the US this week?
- Yeah

128
00:11:28,743 --> 00:11:30,184
Is this the place, right here?

129
00:11:31,234 --> 00:11:32,480
Look

130
00:11:33,742 --> 00:11:35,719
I told you, it's right

131
00:11:36,381 --> 00:11:37,943
I'm envious

132
00:11:37,944 --> 00:11:39,597
I want to go to the US too

133
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:42,775
You'll go to the US during vacation, where your brother is,
and be hospitalized in a mental hospital

134
00:11:42,776 --> 00:11:44,903
- It's a delusion made by himself
- I'll buy you your favorite hamburger

135
00:11:45,353 --> 00:11:47,979
My brother said they have
really big hamburgers there, like this big

136
00:11:48,763 --> 00:11:50,365
US hamburgers are kind of big

137
00:11:57,539 --> 00:11:58,800
Yes, mom

138
00:12:01,463 --> 00:12:03,733
I get nervous as soon as I see my mom...

139
00:12:10,294 --> 00:12:12,190
Hosu, let's go play catch

140
00:12:13,681 --> 00:12:14,830
Jooan

141
00:12:15,616 --> 00:12:17,877
Do you know which school Haru attended
before transferring here?

142
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:19,910
No?

143
00:12:19,911 --> 00:12:22,064
He said some middle school in Munhyeon City

144
00:12:22,404 --> 00:12:24,061
He didn't say which one, why?

145
00:12:25,124 --> 00:12:27,209
Never mind, just curious

146
00:12:28,629 --> 00:12:29,833
Come on, hurry up

147
00:12:37,252 --> 00:12:39,706
Hey, your house is really nice

148
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:42,443
Mom, Dogeon is here

149
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:43,929
Oh

150
00:12:45,409 --> 00:12:46,650
Welcome

151
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,626
Hello

152
00:12:48,627 --> 00:12:51,402
I feel assured
as if Jeha's grade is improved

153
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:53,756
- Please take good care of him
- Yes

154
00:12:54,556 --> 00:12:58,665
And about that,
the part-time job for the scholarship...

155
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,983
- Ah, yes
- I've already talked to the kids' father, so don't worry

156
00:13:04,943 --> 00:13:06,489
Thank you

157
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,780
- Go inside, I'll bring you some snacks
- Dogeon, here

158
00:13:21,581 --> 00:13:24,491
Dogeon,
I'll study after doing this, really

159
00:13:28,554 --> 00:13:29,710
But why aren't you eating?

160
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:33,268
Why is the apple shaped like a rabbit?

161
00:13:37,061 --> 00:13:38,242
Do you want me to give you
some socks, Dogeon?

162
00:13:39,707 --> 00:13:40,854
Did you see it?

163
00:13:43,308 --> 00:13:44,928
- Here
- Thanks

164
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:50,342
You're really quick-witted

165
00:13:50,745 --> 00:13:52,201
I've felt that way for a while...

166
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,805
My stepdad says
he doesn't like that I'm too observant...

167
00:13:57,485 --> 00:13:59,760
No! Hey, you can't die there!

168
00:14:02,888 --> 00:14:05,148
Just this round, only this round

169
00:14:05,866 --> 00:14:07,489
How many hours do you play games each day?

170
00:14:08,307 --> 00:14:09,467
Why do you like gaming?

171
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,019
I'm really good at this game

172
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:14,899
Here, I can't study well and it's boring

173
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,631
In the game,
everyone wants to be on my team

174
00:14:18,132 --> 00:14:19,399
If I'm not online, they look for me

175
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,179
I'm popular, everyone likes me

176
00:14:24,861 --> 00:14:27,678
Everyone likes you here too

177
00:14:30,021 --> 00:14:32,604
Ah, you'll probably see Hwan often

178
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:33,864
He's right here

179
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,384
Maybe... three times?

180
00:14:37,072 --> 00:14:38,385
Haven't seen much though...

181
00:14:39,954 --> 00:14:42,176
- Really?
- It's perfect, perfect!

182
00:14:42,177 --> 00:14:43,977
Hey, go inside!

183
00:14:44,782 --> 00:14:46,541
- Ma'am
- Yes, Hwan?

184
00:14:46,542 --> 00:14:48,880
I was going to
cut some fruits and put them in your room

185
00:14:49,601 --> 00:14:50,969
Did you clean my room?

186
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,768
Yes, I cleaned it

187
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,553
- Did you happen to see the camcorder?
- Camcorder?

188
00:14:57,986 --> 00:14:59,179
Isn't it in your room?

189
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:02,598
I only cleaned,
I didn't throw anything away

190
00:15:04,007 --> 00:15:05,324
Do you need it right now?

191
00:15:05,842 --> 00:15:06,993
No, it's not

192
00:15:31,152 --> 00:15:32,714
Hwan, why?

193
00:15:55,461 --> 00:15:56,761
Get ready to go with me

194
00:15:59,088 --> 00:16:01,986
Assemblyman, that place might be
a bit too much for Hwan to go to...

195
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:16,363
I'm sorry

196
00:16:16,364 --> 00:16:17,445
We're late

197
00:16:17,446 --> 00:16:18,879
No, you're not

198
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,059
Ah, your son is coming with you today?

199
00:16:21,299 --> 00:16:22,388
Hello

200
00:16:22,805 --> 00:16:24,604
He has his grandfather's face

201
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,403
Have a seat

202
00:16:29,382 --> 00:16:31,499
- Go wait outside
- Yes

203
00:16:38,224 --> 00:16:42,771
- Have you made your presence in the neighborhood?
- Yes

204
00:16:42,772 --> 00:16:44,743
I'm just starting to
go around and greet people

205
00:16:47,158 --> 00:16:50,499
It's a place that
your father cultivated well to win the vote

206
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,842
There shouldn't be any big problems

207
00:16:52,567 --> 00:16:56,094
We'll set up your area in this room
during the redevelopment

208
00:16:56,899 --> 00:16:59,908
- You can go to Seoul and play in the big leagues
- Yes

209
00:17:00,709 --> 00:17:02,265
I respectfully ask for your care

210
00:17:10,595 --> 00:17:12,220
I remember the first time I saw him

211
00:17:12,933 --> 00:17:14,722
Wasn't it when you visited
your father in the hospital?

212
00:17:15,972 --> 00:17:18,330
Back then, you could barely walk...

213
00:17:20,984 --> 00:17:22,964
- Oh, I...
- Take it

214
00:17:24,366 --> 00:17:26,201
You should learn to drink from your elders

215
00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:29,587
Yes, like your grandfather, your father

216
00:17:29,588 --> 00:17:32,651
If you want to do big things,
you should start by learning to drink, right?

217
00:17:33,444 --> 00:17:35,010
Here, take it

218
00:17:45,006 --> 00:17:46,391
Have a drink

219
00:17:56,656 --> 00:17:58,927
Hwan, try some of this

220
00:17:58,928 --> 00:18:00,051
It's honey tea

221
00:18:02,109 --> 00:18:04,394
My goodness, assemblyman is really...

222
00:18:04,395 --> 00:18:07,073
How come he let a student drink this much?

223
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:10,867
Thank you

224
00:18:13,893 --> 00:18:15,679
Are you okay?

225
00:18:17,736 --> 00:18:18,975
I'm fine

226
00:18:35,437 --> 00:18:37,976
Email_Unread

227
00:18:39,455 --> 00:18:40,618
What's this?

228
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:41,708
He didn't even read it

229
00:18:46,921 --> 00:18:48,567
Haru? Your medicine

230
00:18:54,715 --> 00:18:57,121
- Did you take the ones at lunch?
- Yes, I did

231
00:19:09,035 --> 00:19:10,775
Sangmin must be very busy, right?

232
00:19:11,646 --> 00:19:13,696
Of course, he's naturally busy

233
00:19:13,697 --> 00:19:14,949
He's about to graduate

234
00:19:15,849 --> 00:19:17,298
When are we going to the US?

235
00:19:17,299 --> 00:19:18,905
Is it okay if I miss school?

236
00:19:24,762 --> 00:19:26,431
But still...

237
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:29,355
Isn't it a bit much
to skip school and go see him?

238
00:19:30,157 --> 00:19:32,605
He said he would be coming to Korea soon

239
00:19:34,912 --> 00:19:36,182
Why?

240
00:19:37,241 --> 00:19:39,403
I want to see him receive his degree...

241
00:19:40,135 --> 00:19:41,745
He would want to see me too, right?

242
00:19:49,564 --> 00:19:50,632
Why?

243
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,505
Did he say he doesn't want to see me?
Did he not want me to come?

244
00:19:55,968 --> 00:19:59,027
It's not that,
it's just he's really busy and...

245
00:19:59,028 --> 00:20:01,188
Even if you come,
he might not have time to spend with you...

246
00:20:02,708 --> 00:20:05,067
This time, just mom and dad will go

247
00:20:05,587 --> 00:20:07,622
Grandma will come to take care of you
while we're gone

248
00:20:08,053 --> 00:20:09,254
Is that okay?

249
00:20:12,557 --> 00:20:13,788
Haru

250
00:20:14,398 --> 00:20:16,188
Mom, dad, and Sangmin

251
00:20:16,892 --> 00:20:19,073
We all love Haru

252
00:20:19,074 --> 00:20:21,766
You know that, right?

253
00:20:23,752 --> 00:20:25,017
I love you too

254
00:20:29,921 --> 00:20:31,558
You shouldn't stay up too late

255
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:33,978
- You have to go to school early tomorrow
- Yes

256
00:20:53,292 --> 00:20:55,361
Compose Email

257
00:21:06,293 --> 00:21:08,960
Hey, don't you want to see me?

258
00:21:11,646 --> 00:21:13,231
Are you embarrassed by me?

259
00:21:41,572 --> 00:21:42,749
What?

260
00:21:43,818 --> 00:21:45,616
Hwan! What are you doing?

261
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:49,667
I'm breathing

262
00:21:52,921 --> 00:21:54,268
Here?

263
00:21:54,269 --> 00:21:55,556
Really?

264
00:22:09,778 --> 00:22:11,389
Hey, just stay still for a moment

265
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:12,578
I'm feeling dizzy

266
00:22:13,685 --> 00:22:14,852
What?

267
00:22:16,913 --> 00:22:18,731
I told you to stay still

268
00:22:18,732 --> 00:22:20,645
Why are you shaking so much?

269
00:22:22,877 --> 00:22:24,304
You're the one
who's staggering right now

270
00:22:25,989 --> 00:22:27,178
Me?

271
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,528
Me?

272
00:22:32,111 --> 00:22:33,316
No, I'm not

273
00:22:34,699 --> 00:22:36,195
I'm totally...

274
00:22:36,196 --> 00:22:37,452
Uh, oh!

275
00:22:37,893 --> 00:22:38,948
Hwan

276
00:22:39,301 --> 00:22:40,447
Hwan

277
00:22:49,658 --> 00:22:51,385
He deleted the challenge video

278
00:22:51,386 --> 00:22:53,188
Trying to prevent people from
seeing Haru Park, the psycho

279
00:22:53,189 --> 00:22:56,362
There goes Haru Park, the cockroach,
acting all nice and pitiful again

280
00:22:56,363 --> 00:22:57,295
Sociopath

281
00:22:57,296 --> 00:22:58,970
Why don't you run away again, Haru Park?

282
00:22:58,971 --> 00:23:00,619
Run away, I'll find you again

283
00:23:04,877 --> 00:23:06,327
Post Deleted

284
00:23:19,118 --> 00:23:20,262
Haru

285
00:23:28,868 --> 00:23:33,353
Next time,
let's go together to see him, okay?

286
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:35,316
Yes

287
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:39,638
Mom will fully pack
your favorite US snacks in the trunk

288
00:23:40,078 --> 00:23:41,198
Promise!

289
00:23:41,646 --> 00:23:42,849
Yes

290
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:44,112
Take care on your trip

291
00:23:44,828 --> 00:23:46,445
Dad, take care too

292
00:23:46,446 --> 00:23:48,067
Okay, take it easy

293
00:23:50,143 --> 00:23:51,858
- Listen to grandma, okay?
- Yes

294
00:24:11,413 --> 00:24:13,693
It was so funny yesterday

295
00:24:13,694 --> 00:24:15,962
Hwan got so drunk
and was staggering around

296
00:24:16,302 --> 00:24:19,027
No way, I'm not drunk

297
00:24:19,465 --> 00:24:22,288
- Like this
- It wasn't that bad

298
00:24:23,814 --> 00:24:25,368
Ah, my shoes, where are they?

299
00:24:26,228 --> 00:24:28,164
My shoes...!

300
00:24:28,165 --> 00:24:30,223
When did I do that!

301
00:24:30,224 --> 00:24:32,024
You were like this, going all...

302
00:24:32,599 --> 00:24:33,735
No, I wasn't that bad...

303
00:24:34,454 --> 00:24:36,807
Where are my shoes,
where are my shoes' just like that

304
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:39,019
Haru Park transferred out of our school

305
00:24:39,976 --> 00:24:41,859
I know him, why?

306
00:24:43,962 --> 00:24:45,221
Hosu!

307
00:24:46,004 --> 00:24:47,436
Did you see?

308
00:24:47,437 --> 00:24:49,423
The STEP UP dance video you made
was also deleted

309
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:52,949
It seems there's been some glitch
with the program lately

310
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:54,209
I deleted it

311
00:24:55,348 --> 00:24:56,536
You did?

312
00:24:57,141 --> 00:24:59,942
- Why?
- Well, on a closer look, the moves weren't that great

313
00:25:00,568 --> 00:25:01,967
So, I'm planning to reshoot it

314
00:25:02,408 --> 00:25:04,375
Hey, then I'll reshoot it for you

315
00:25:04,376 --> 00:25:05,659
I have a lot of time today

316
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,460
Since mom and dad
went to the US today anyway...

317
00:25:13,396 --> 00:25:14,930
Why didn't you go?

318
00:25:17,771 --> 00:25:18,982
Well, that's...

319
00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:24,568
Hey Haru, sorry,
but I can't go with you today

320
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:26,902
Mrs. Kim asked me to come over a bit early

321
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:29,964
- Okay
- I'll go then

322
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:41,649
He was all set to go to the US
where his brother is...

323
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:44,167
There was a rumor that he actually went into
and came out of a psychiatric hospital

324
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:45,879
Is that true?

325
00:25:47,208 --> 00:25:49,023
No, that's a lie,
what are you talking about...

326
00:25:49,906 --> 00:25:51,228
Are you close with him?

327
00:25:52,302 --> 00:25:53,921
He's just cute. Kind too

328
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,064
How about you?

329
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,607
How's your new family?

330
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:01,702
Hey, you used to cause trouble
in the orphanage all the time

331
00:26:01,703 --> 00:26:03,119
You got scolded by Mrs. Kim a lot

332
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,653
Hosu, I don't want to talk about
the orphanage anymore

333
00:26:10,307 --> 00:26:11,311
Really?

334
00:26:12,116 --> 00:26:13,144
Sorry

335
00:26:14,505 --> 00:26:15,737
Even after being adopted

336
00:26:16,438 --> 00:26:19,824
rumors about being from an orphanage
continued at school for a while...

337
00:26:22,734 --> 00:26:24,025
I see

338
00:26:24,687 --> 00:26:25,826
Do you not have that problem?

339
00:26:27,268 --> 00:26:28,879
Everyone at our school already knows

340
00:26:30,408 --> 00:26:31,592
What can I do about it?

341
00:26:32,936 --> 00:26:34,469
It's true that I lived in an orphanage

342
00:26:36,459 --> 00:26:40,237
I heard that the orphanage will be gone
once your neighborhood is redeveloped

343
00:26:41,362 --> 00:26:43,462
So the kids will be split up
and sent to different orphanages?

344
00:26:45,592 --> 00:26:46,703
Looks like it

345
00:26:48,051 --> 00:26:50,299
It's probably hard for all of them
to go to the same place

346
00:27:08,977 --> 00:27:10,311
That reflection in the mirror,
that's Haru Park

347
00:27:10,312 --> 00:27:11,371
Psycho cockroach

348
00:27:11,372 --> 00:27:12,601
He's been hiding
in Songjoo Jeil Middle School

349
00:27:12,602 --> 00:27:13,675
He deleted the challenge video

350
00:27:13,676 --> 00:27:15,073
Trying to prevent people from
seeing Haru Park, the psycho

351
00:27:15,074 --> 00:27:17,512
There goes Haru Park, the cockroach,
acting all nice and pitiful again

352
00:27:17,513 --> 00:27:18,784
Sociopath

353
00:27:20,864 --> 00:27:23,116
On a closer look,
the moves weren't that great

354
00:27:23,743 --> 00:27:25,042
So, I'm planning to reshoot it

355
00:27:27,774 --> 00:27:29,169
12-year-old boy Choi missing,
search hampered by rainy season...

356
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:31,313
No witnesses found, intensive investigation
at Grass Flower Arboretum

357
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:35,788
[Run away]

358
00:27:42,887 --> 00:27:44,451
[Run away]

359
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:48,588
[Run away]

360
00:27:51,888 --> 00:27:53,392
[Run away]

361
00:27:54,489 --> 00:27:55,742
[Run away]

362
00:27:59,118 --> 00:28:00,519
[Run away]

363
00:28:05,842 --> 00:28:08,115
[Run away]

364
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,772
[Run away]

365
00:28:22,426 --> 00:28:23,817
[Run away]

366
00:28:27,185 --> 00:28:28,532
[Run away]

367
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:34,484
[Run away]

368
00:28:42,064 --> 00:28:43,214
Hey!

369
00:28:53,281 --> 00:28:54,559
What are you doing, all by yourself?

370
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:55,994
Where's Hosu?

371
00:28:59,191 --> 00:29:01,989
Hosu went home early
because Mrs. Kim told him to

372
00:29:03,362 --> 00:29:06,225
Ah, you walk a long way, don't you?

373
00:29:06,226 --> 00:29:07,316
Isn't it tiring?

374
00:29:08,014 --> 00:29:09,858
No, I'm fine

375
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:13,442
Why do humans have legs

376
00:29:13,443 --> 00:29:15,016
to walk around, it's so bothersome

377
00:29:15,017 --> 00:29:16,260
Look at snakes

378
00:29:16,261 --> 00:29:18,541
They just lie there
and nobody says anything

379
00:29:18,542 --> 00:29:19,601
How comfortable is that?

380
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:21,127
Right?

381
00:29:26,957 --> 00:29:28,128
Hey

382
00:29:28,129 --> 00:29:29,205
Yes?

383
00:29:31,392 --> 00:29:32,431
Let's go

384
00:29:36,612 --> 00:29:37,665
Let's go

385
00:29:39,554 --> 00:29:40,924
Come on, I'll buy you something tasty

386
00:29:41,849 --> 00:29:45,135
If you're going to walk a long way again,
you need to eat something good

387
00:30:00,025 --> 00:30:03,576
You've ordered two
'Dugeun Dugeun Choco the Love Pearl' drinks

388
00:30:03,577 --> 00:30:06,277
How would you like
the sweetness and ice level?

389
00:30:09,137 --> 00:30:11,723
Bold... ice?

390
00:30:13,972 --> 00:30:15,684
Yes, the sweetness and ice

391
00:30:17,743 --> 00:30:19,650
Did she say 'bold ice'?

392
00:30:26,507 --> 00:30:28,087
I'll come back next time

393
00:30:29,466 --> 00:30:32,017
Thank you, have a nice day

394
00:30:33,142 --> 00:30:35,417
I was expecting to get something tasty

395
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:39,841
Hey, who's the smartest among us?

396
00:30:42,303 --> 00:30:44,267
- Dogeon?
- Yeah, yeah

397
00:30:45,516 --> 00:30:47,648
Then we should come here
with Dogeon next time

398
00:30:50,167 --> 00:30:52,243
What's this 'Dugeun Dugeun' pearl thing?

399
00:30:53,044 --> 00:30:56,936
I mean, if it's ice, then it's ice.
What's 'bold'?

400
00:30:58,375 --> 00:30:59,725
Right?

401
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:06,535
Why are you laughing? Isn't it strange?

402
00:31:07,267 --> 00:31:08,533
Huh?

403
00:31:11,125 --> 00:31:13,185
It's really hard, seriously

404
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,506
My parents are also
having a really hard time

405
00:31:19,797 --> 00:31:21,157
I'm struggling too

406
00:31:25,114 --> 00:31:26,748
I feel like I'm going crazy

407
00:31:31,874 --> 00:31:33,822
If I could just remember that time,

408
00:31:33,823 --> 00:31:36,117
I'd like to shake it off and feel relieved

409
00:31:39,548 --> 00:31:41,162
But I really can't remember

410
00:31:47,893 --> 00:31:49,172
Just a moment

411
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,316
Next, next!

412
00:32:56,746 --> 00:32:58,147
Hurry up!

413
00:32:58,148 --> 00:33:00,094
There are only up to ep. 19 here, right?

414
00:33:00,531 --> 00:33:02,042
Why!

415
00:33:02,043 --> 00:33:04,220
- What!
- The protagonist just...

416
00:33:07,882 --> 00:33:11,727
It ended right where it set
a huge death flag with 'Did he finish it off?'

417
00:33:11,728 --> 00:33:13,588
- Hurry up and find it
- Okay

418
00:33:13,589 --> 00:33:15,762
He told you there are only up to 19 here

419
00:33:21,891 --> 00:33:23,529
It was such a crucial moment...

420
00:33:27,857 --> 00:33:28,988
What is this, anyway?

421
00:33:30,267 --> 00:33:31,329
What's this?

422
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:34,863
When I went to Jeha's house for tutoring,

423
00:33:35,384 --> 00:33:38,648
there were apples shaped like rabbits,
and these things were all stuck on top

424
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:39,917
What are these?

425
00:33:41,025 --> 00:33:42,291
Are they like forks?

426
00:33:42,897 --> 00:33:45,124
- Have you never seen this before?
- Yeah

427
00:33:45,846 --> 00:33:47,269
Why don't we know about things like this?

428
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,216
We didn't even know such things existed

429
00:33:51,327 --> 00:33:57,463
What is this thing,
plastic with animal shapes, what is this?

430
00:33:59,784 --> 00:34:00,983
Just...

431
00:34:02,194 --> 00:34:05,201
I felt a bit pitiful for me
not knowing about things like this

432
00:34:06,291 --> 00:34:07,399
for a moment

433
00:34:09,868 --> 00:34:11,168
Yes?

434
00:34:12,576 --> 00:34:14,383
What did you say?

435
00:34:16,434 --> 00:34:17,681
I didn't say anything

436
00:34:18,766 --> 00:34:19,944
Was it you?

437
00:34:22,853 --> 00:34:24,009
Why is he acting like that?

438
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:29,844
No, it wasn't

439
00:34:30,927 --> 00:34:32,442
I thought you were calling me...

440
00:34:55,661 --> 00:34:58,375
Ah, I have to go to
the psychiatrist again next week

441
00:34:59,632 --> 00:35:00,719
It's so bothersome

442
00:35:03,335 --> 00:35:05,052
But after going there a few times

443
00:35:05,053 --> 00:35:08,112
I realized it's just like going to
the pediatrician or internal medicine for a cold

444
00:35:10,094 --> 00:35:11,243
No, why

445
00:35:11,696 --> 00:35:14,345
People are born with
their own weaknesses, right?

446
00:35:14,956 --> 00:35:18,655
Like some people catch colds easily
and some break bones easily

447
00:35:19,648 --> 00:35:20,818
Just like that

448
00:35:21,696 --> 00:35:22,888
People who go to psychiatrists...

449
00:35:22,889 --> 00:35:25,315
The teacher said it's like
being born with a weaker heart

450
00:35:28,716 --> 00:35:30,180
- Hey, Haru
- Hey, Hosu!

451
00:35:32,118 --> 00:35:33,437
Ah, I forgot

452
00:35:33,438 --> 00:35:35,777
My mom told me to come home early today...

453
00:35:37,293 --> 00:35:39,071
But aren't your parents in the US?

454
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,751
Ah, it's my grandmother, my grandmother

455
00:35:46,354 --> 00:35:48,537
Sorry, I have to go home early today

456
00:35:50,165 --> 00:35:51,332
Hey, Haru

457
00:36:17,286 --> 00:36:20,019
- Anyone for ice cream?
- Me, me, me!

458
00:36:27,381 --> 00:36:29,336
Huh? What's this?

459
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:30,901
Why is one left over?

460
00:36:33,106 --> 00:36:34,434
Why didn't Haru come?

461
00:36:35,205 --> 00:36:36,604
Ah, is it this week?

462
00:36:37,047 --> 00:36:40,024
Haru was supposed to go to the US
for his brother's graduation ceremony

463
00:36:41,004 --> 00:36:42,378
But he was at school today

464
00:36:43,085 --> 00:36:44,885
When I asked him
why he didn't go to the US,

465
00:36:45,605 --> 00:36:49,365
he said that his passport had expired

466
00:36:50,979 --> 00:36:53,476
The passport expired...

467
00:36:54,346 --> 00:36:56,728
Yeah, so only his parents decided to go

468
00:36:58,515 --> 00:36:59,955
That's what he said when I saw him earlier

469
00:37:02,907 --> 00:37:04,065
Dogeon

470
00:37:05,069 --> 00:37:06,272
When are you free?

471
00:37:07,074 --> 00:37:08,974
Why, is there something you need?

472
00:37:09,868 --> 00:37:11,492
Do you know what 'Dodo Ice' is?

473
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:14,233
What?

474
00:37:16,026 --> 00:37:17,287
Arrogant?

475
00:37:19,165 --> 00:37:20,969
Arrogant ice?

476
00:37:24,703 --> 00:37:25,850
Cein

477
00:37:26,731 --> 00:37:28,228
Why would ice be arrogant?

478
00:37:28,229 --> 00:37:29,275
You just eat it

479
00:37:32,094 --> 00:37:34,553
You... make some time, okay?

480
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,942
- Yes
- Okay

481
00:37:41,715 --> 00:37:43,411
Huh? It's Haru!

482
00:37:45,974 --> 00:37:47,112
Why is he acting like that?

483
00:37:47,113 --> 00:37:48,246
He was like that last time too...

484
00:37:54,241 --> 00:37:55,454
Haru!

485
00:38:06,623 --> 00:38:08,138
Hey, Haru

486
00:38:12,108 --> 00:38:13,448
Jooan, I'm sorry

487
00:38:13,999 --> 00:38:15,055
Are you okay?

488
00:38:15,456 --> 00:38:16,957
Haru, are you okay?

489
00:38:17,702 --> 00:38:18,944
Are you hurt somewhere?

490
00:38:19,727 --> 00:38:20,895
Why do you look like that?

491
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:25,615
It's because you're... You're disappointed

492
00:38:25,616 --> 00:38:26,961
Haru also wanted to go to the US...

493
00:38:27,651 --> 00:38:28,768
Right?

494
00:38:29,325 --> 00:38:30,325
Yeah...

495
00:38:32,665 --> 00:38:33,746
Are you okay?

496
00:38:38,167 --> 00:38:40,749
My dad forgot to book the flight tickets...

497
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,612
So that's why

498
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:47,500
I thought
the passport's expiration was the problem

499
00:38:49,412 --> 00:38:52,847
I mean, it's just that
dad suddenly got busy with work

500
00:38:52,848 --> 00:38:54,110
He must have been preoccupied

501
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:56,060
Hey, who wants to eat tteokbokki?

502
00:38:56,737 --> 00:38:58,377
- I'll treat
- Me

503
00:38:58,855 --> 00:39:01,194
- Me, me too
- Can I have mini gimbap?

504
00:39:01,195 --> 00:39:02,242
Of course

505
00:39:02,243 --> 00:39:03,282
Hey, let's go

506
00:39:03,664 --> 00:39:04,665
Let's go!

507
00:39:07,529 --> 00:39:08,538
Shall we go?

508
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:11,865
Let's go

509
00:39:12,321 --> 00:39:13,345
Come on, let's go

510
00:39:19,136 --> 00:39:20,197
Who is it?

511
00:39:21,686 --> 00:39:22,967
Which one of you two did this?

512
00:39:24,132 --> 00:39:25,436
or was it both of you?

513
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:27,961
Honey, someone might hear you

514
00:39:27,962 --> 00:39:29,151
Does this even make sense?

515
00:39:29,736 --> 00:39:31,603
How dare you touch Dad's wallet, huh?

516
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:34,874
I knew something was off since last time

517
00:39:35,376 --> 00:39:37,247
This time, I specifically counted
and put the money in

518
00:39:38,026 --> 00:39:39,215
and now, 50,000 won is missing!

519
00:39:40,684 --> 00:39:41,735
Who is it?

520
00:39:42,399 --> 00:39:43,522
Who is it!

521
00:39:45,872 --> 00:39:46,947
Mingook Seo

522
00:39:48,183 --> 00:39:49,785
Why me?

523
00:39:49,786 --> 00:39:51,314
It's not me, Dad

524
00:39:53,425 --> 00:39:54,770
Why are you just standing there?

525
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:56,393
Is it you?

526
00:39:57,971 --> 00:40:01,037
I saw Jeha going into the master bedroom

527
00:40:03,164 --> 00:40:04,697
when Dad wasn't around

528
00:40:05,628 --> 00:40:06,680
Multiple times

529
00:40:08,225 --> 00:40:09,276
Is it really you?

530
00:40:10,532 --> 00:40:11,655
Jeha Jeon

531
00:40:16,828 --> 00:40:17,887
Come here

532
00:40:19,318 --> 00:40:22,270
Someone with only crap in their head
needs to have their brain washed out

533
00:40:22,681 --> 00:40:23,716
Come here!

534
00:40:24,367 --> 00:40:26,747
How dare
a kid touches the Dad's wallet, huh!

535
00:40:26,748 --> 00:40:28,793
Who told you to do that?
Can't you stand up straight?

536
00:40:29,418 --> 00:40:31,015
Stand up straight, I said!

537
00:40:31,438 --> 00:40:32,551
Did you steal it?

538
00:40:32,552 --> 00:40:34,180
Huh? Are you out of your mind?

539
00:40:34,915 --> 00:40:36,173
Stand up straight, man!

540
00:40:39,296 --> 00:40:40,485
Can't you stand up straight?

541
00:40:41,648 --> 00:40:42,775
Did you steal it?

542
00:40:42,776 --> 00:40:44,474
Huh? Are you out of your mind?

543
00:40:45,228 --> 00:40:46,863
Stand up straight, man!

544
00:42:21,042 --> 00:42:22,085
Hey, Hwan

545
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:26,789
What are you doing here?

546
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:27,907
This camcorder

547
00:42:28,867 --> 00:42:30,368
Did my father do this?

548
00:42:31,463 --> 00:42:33,177
Then why did you bring that here?

549
00:42:33,744 --> 00:42:35,083
He doesn't want to talk about it...

550
00:42:35,597 --> 00:42:37,052
Hwan, Hwan!

551
00:42:37,053 --> 00:42:38,415
Calm down, okay? Hwan!

552
00:42:45,797 --> 00:42:47,220
What are you doing all the time?

553
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:53,648
I'm going to school

554
00:42:56,826 --> 00:42:59,550
Stop pretending to be
a rebellious teenager and listen

555
00:43:01,823 --> 00:43:04,646
When I was your age,
I had already set my lifelong vision

556
00:43:12,542 --> 00:43:14,600
I told you
to walk towards the light, clearly

557
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,081
Do you want me to put it in simpler terms?

558
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:04,826
Jeha

559
00:44:06,657 --> 00:44:07,662
Why are you like this?

560
00:44:08,585 --> 00:44:09,858
What are you doing here!

561
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:17,609
Hey, Jeha

562
00:44:27,448 --> 00:44:29,743
Hey, do you feel wronged?

563
00:44:30,577 --> 00:44:33,190
What's there to feel wronged about, huh?

564
00:44:35,618 --> 00:44:37,754
But your mom seems
really smart, doesn’t she?

565
00:44:38,505 --> 00:44:40,325
You got hit by water

566
00:44:40,326 --> 00:44:42,024
and your mother didn't stop him and watched

567
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:45,591
If your mom had defended you,

568
00:44:46,172 --> 00:44:48,016
knowing my dad's temper,
he would have flipped everything over

569
00:44:48,017 --> 00:44:50,386
and you and your mom
would have been kicked out immediately

570
00:44:50,806 --> 00:44:53,956
Especially since it involved Dad's wallet

571
00:44:54,816 --> 00:44:56,270
You think he'd just let it go?

572
00:44:57,358 --> 00:44:59,509
My dad's temper is no joke

573
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:02,214
You should be thankful
it ended this way, you know?

574
00:45:13,267 --> 00:45:15,300
Jeha, did you really do it?

575
00:45:17,168 --> 00:45:18,526
Did you steal money from your dad's wallet?

576
00:45:21,827 --> 00:45:23,117
You didn't do it, right?

577
00:45:23,844 --> 00:45:24,868
Huh?

578
00:45:25,521 --> 00:45:27,811
Jeha Jeon, you didn't do it, did you?

579
00:45:30,070 --> 00:45:31,216
Then...

580
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:34,798
Then why don't you say it's not you?

581
00:45:35,536 --> 00:45:36,611
It's not you!

582
00:45:36,612 --> 00:45:37,844
You didn't do it!

583
00:45:40,501 --> 00:45:42,206
That way, the house will be peaceful

584
00:45:45,348 --> 00:45:46,809
and mom will be happy

585
00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:50,717
What about you?

586
00:45:53,019 --> 00:45:54,367
Then are you happy?

587
00:45:57,884 --> 00:45:59,210
Where are you!

588
00:46:00,504 --> 00:46:02,302
Jeha Jeon, where are you!

589
00:46:05,232 --> 00:46:07,361
Do you want to be loved by Dad that much?

590
00:46:12,147 --> 00:46:13,348
What about you, Hwan?

591
00:46:18,757 --> 00:46:20,297
Where are you in all this?

592
00:46:58,441 --> 00:46:59,638
Jeha...

593
00:47:01,297 --> 00:47:02,685
Jeha didn't do it

594
00:47:04,875 --> 00:47:06,049
You know that

595
00:47:15,098 --> 00:47:16,206
Jeha

596
00:47:17,635 --> 00:47:19,093
He's not the kind of person
who would do such a thing

597
00:47:20,293 --> 00:47:21,477
and

598
00:47:23,533 --> 00:47:25,755
Jeha obviously wouldn't have told
you, but...

599
00:47:34,302 --> 00:47:35,590
In the meantime,

600
00:47:37,714 --> 00:47:39,403
I've seen Mingook bullying Jeha a lot

601
00:47:42,317 --> 00:47:44,700
It's really not me, Dad

602
00:47:45,108 --> 00:47:46,185
It's not

603
00:47:46,186 --> 00:47:47,977
No, it's really not me!

604
00:47:47,978 --> 00:47:49,687
- Come inside with me!
- I didn't even touch the wallet

605
00:47:52,666 --> 00:47:54,699
You're dead today!

606
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:56,337
I'm telling you, it's really not me!

607
00:47:56,887 --> 00:47:58,582
You don't deserve
to be called brother, huh!

608
00:47:58,583 --> 00:47:59,824
I am a brother, but it's really not me!

609
00:48:00,817 --> 00:48:02,179
Come here, you little brat!

610
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:03,354
Why are you doing this to me!

611
00:48:03,355 --> 00:48:04,402
Do it to him!

612
00:48:42,304 --> 00:48:43,836
You're the one who did it, you brat!

613
00:48:46,004 --> 00:48:47,161
Say it

614
00:48:48,753 --> 00:48:50,113
Say it, I said!

615
00:48:52,321 --> 00:48:53,401
Hey

616
00:48:53,914 --> 00:48:56,611
When Dad goes into the bathroom
to get ready for work in the morning,

617
00:48:56,993 --> 00:48:59,289
I've seen you
sneaking into the master bedroom

618
00:48:59,290 --> 00:49:00,692
I've seen it several times

619
00:49:04,949 --> 00:49:06,479
You think you're smart, huh?

620
00:49:06,985 --> 00:49:10,483
You're doing this
to get back at me because I hate you

621
00:49:10,484 --> 00:49:11,658
Like this

622
00:49:14,518 --> 00:49:16,430
Ah, you're really driving me crazy

623
00:49:19,403 --> 00:49:20,593
Hey

624
00:49:22,987 --> 00:49:24,853
I won't let you get away with this

625
00:49:26,638 --> 00:49:28,783
You and your mom, like parasites

626
00:49:29,974 --> 00:49:31,767
I'll definitely make you leave the house

627
00:49:34,023 --> 00:49:35,311
Just wait and see

628
00:49:37,108 --> 00:49:38,506
what I do

629
00:49:59,281 --> 00:50:00,501
Hey, Jeha

630
00:50:03,261 --> 00:50:05,330
Huh? You were here, Hwan?

631
00:50:06,899 --> 00:50:08,105
Since when?

632
00:50:09,292 --> 00:50:10,302
Really...

633
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:13,881
Did you do it?

634
00:50:29,955 --> 00:50:31,109
Hey, Jeha Jeon!

635
00:50:41,432 --> 00:50:43,078
Anyway, our dad has a lot of money

636
00:50:44,342 --> 00:50:45,800
My mom remarried him for that too

637
00:50:48,002 --> 00:50:49,544
That's not the issue right now!

638
00:50:49,545 --> 00:50:50,730
That is the issue

639
00:50:51,821 --> 00:50:53,376
My dad doesn't like me

640
00:50:54,121 --> 00:50:55,310
No matter what I do

641
00:51:00,578 --> 00:51:01,942
He used to like everything

642
00:51:02,456 --> 00:51:03,579
When I pay money

643
00:51:04,953 --> 00:51:06,357
Like with the ice cream earlier

644
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:09,260
and when I paid for Cein's birthday too

645
00:51:11,813 --> 00:51:13,975
Have you ever asked
where this money came from?

646
00:51:18,996 --> 00:51:21,717
You just liked it
when I spent money, all of it!

647
00:51:27,212 --> 00:51:28,421
So...

648
00:51:34,592 --> 00:51:36,216
Now are you going to hate me too?

649
00:52:01,829 --> 00:52:03,010
Come down

650
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:30,883
It's okay

651
00:52:55,594 --> 00:52:56,731
Meow

652
00:52:58,077 --> 00:52:59,230
Meow

653
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:02,144
Kitty

654
00:53:11,031 --> 00:53:12,039
Where did it go?

655
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:16,135
I guess the cat's mother took it away

656
00:53:17,033 --> 00:53:18,139
She abandoned it

657
00:53:19,563 --> 00:53:20,845
How do you know?

658
00:53:20,846 --> 00:53:23,745
If she was going to take it,
she would have done so already

659
00:53:24,750 --> 00:53:26,119
She ran away

660
00:53:26,867 --> 00:53:27,912
to live by herself alone

661
00:53:28,865 --> 00:53:30,056
That mother cat too

662
00:53:31,154 --> 00:53:32,881
Hey, that's...

663
00:53:32,882 --> 00:53:34,915
Our dad didn't know

664
00:53:36,506 --> 00:53:38,082
so he couldn't do that for us

665
00:53:39,609 --> 00:53:40,959
If our dad had known,

666
00:53:42,870 --> 00:53:44,566
he would have carved apples into
rabbit shapes for us

667
00:53:45,938 --> 00:53:49,530
and put those things
that Jeha brought from his house

668
00:53:50,210 --> 00:53:52,650
Yeah, he would have done that

669
00:53:53,232 --> 00:53:54,348
Right

670
00:53:55,988 --> 00:53:57,176
Anyway

671
00:54:10,585 --> 00:54:11,755
Dogeon!

672
00:54:12,614 --> 00:54:13,945
Look at this

673
00:54:13,946 --> 00:54:15,013
It's flower

674
00:54:15,430 --> 00:54:16,618
Did someone drop it?

675
00:54:16,619 --> 00:54:18,303
No way!

676
00:54:18,304 --> 00:54:20,848
Maybe the cat left it here
to thank us for feeding

677
00:54:21,168 --> 00:54:22,336
Awesome!

678
00:54:24,011 --> 00:54:25,223
Exactly

679
00:54:25,789 --> 00:54:27,123
The cat is saying thank you

680
00:54:27,124 --> 00:54:29,082
It must have gone to the flower shop
and bought it with 500 won

681
00:54:30,752 --> 00:54:32,143
It's my first time
receiving a flower as a gift

682
00:54:34,946 --> 00:54:36,561
I guess this cat really likes me

683
00:54:39,123 --> 00:54:41,165
To the cat, you are a hero

684
00:54:42,825 --> 00:54:44,968
But a hero who can't save himself

685
00:54:49,243 --> 00:54:50,649
The final exams are coming soon

686
00:54:51,328 --> 00:54:54,219
How's school adaptation going?
All settled now?

687
00:54:54,843 --> 00:54:57,165
Time flies, doesn't it?

688
00:54:58,067 --> 00:55:00,217
Ah, about the midterm grades,

689
00:55:00,218 --> 00:55:02,247
I already spoke to your father about it

690
00:55:02,248 --> 00:55:05,277
It must have been hard for you
to show your true abilities

691
00:55:05,278 --> 00:55:06,637
Don't be too anxious

692
00:55:07,023 --> 00:55:09,358
Let's give him a bit more time
until the final exams

693
00:55:13,195 --> 00:55:17,575
Lately... you've been hanging out
with students you get detention with

694
00:55:18,461 --> 00:55:19,828
Are they good friends?

695
00:55:22,272 --> 00:55:23,556
Yes, well...

696
00:55:25,857 --> 00:55:28,241
Your father must be worried

697
00:55:28,754 --> 00:55:29,772
When he hears about that

698
00:55:31,783 --> 00:55:33,172
Friend...

699
00:55:35,323 --> 00:55:36,769
Is that what you're making
and hanging out with?

700
00:55:41,186 --> 00:55:44,613
You want to be acknowledged
by your father, right?

701
00:55:46,670 --> 00:55:50,009
I know how good student Hwan is

702
00:55:50,511 --> 00:55:51,879
That's why I want to help you

703
00:55:56,107 --> 00:55:58,078
You don't need to feel burdened

704
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:00,133
It's also part of education

705
00:56:03,626 --> 00:56:04,815
Later

706
00:56:05,737 --> 00:56:09,173
If... there comes a time when I need help,

707
00:56:10,778 --> 00:56:13,238
I would be grateful
if you don't turn away from me

708
00:56:16,726 --> 00:56:21,494
For now, could you take care of
these orchid plants here?

709
00:56:22,638 --> 00:56:24,758
- Orchids?
- Yes

710
00:56:24,759 --> 00:56:27,987
These orchids are like our students

711
00:56:28,569 --> 00:56:30,451
They always need a caring hand

712
00:56:31,032 --> 00:56:32,662
I hope you take good care of them

713
00:56:53,693 --> 00:56:55,587
What's going on here,
where are the other kids?

714
00:56:55,588 --> 00:56:56,775
Didn't they come?

715
00:57:16,194 --> 00:57:17,284
What is it?

716
00:57:18,872 --> 00:57:20,973
Hey, why did you guys
stop talking after I come?

717
00:57:22,574 --> 00:57:23,975
What is it?

718
00:57:24,910 --> 00:57:25,923
Umm...

719
00:57:26,956 --> 00:57:28,937
Hosu... did you know?

720
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:30,967
Know what?

721
00:57:33,537 --> 00:57:35,539
That it's raining today?

722
00:57:36,364 --> 00:57:38,432
I obviously brought my umbrella!

723
00:57:39,685 --> 00:57:41,140
If I hadn't brought it,
would you have shared with me?

724
00:57:41,141 --> 00:57:42,319
Not that

725
00:57:42,915 --> 00:57:43,997
At school

726
00:57:45,808 --> 00:57:47,676
There are rumors that
Haru is a mental patient

727
00:57:49,044 --> 00:57:50,226
It's been spreading...

728
00:57:52,775 --> 00:57:55,002
Before coming here, I met him

729
00:57:55,684 --> 00:57:57,025
but he just walked away

730
00:57:58,806 --> 00:58:00,268
