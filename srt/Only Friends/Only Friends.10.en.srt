1
00:00:06,217 --> 00:00:07,680
You're not going to see me again.

2
00:00:07,848 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm showing up in front of you for the last time.

3
00:00:10,169 --> 00:00:10,999
Goodbye, Ton.

4
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:12,938
Tell you what.

5
00:00:12,938 --> 00:00:16,285
All my life, I've never been this yielding to anyone.

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,000
I've never been so crazy for anyone that I drove all the way here either.

7
00:00:21,224 --> 00:00:22,410
Can you take my photo?

8
00:00:22,596 --> 00:00:23,781
I want to keep it.

9
00:00:23,781 --> 00:00:26,612
But I took that guy’s photo after we screwed.

10
00:00:26,612 --> 00:00:29,249
You have the key card. Why don't you use it?

11
00:00:46,575 --> 00:00:47,592
Why is he here?

12
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:50,960
To keep me company.

13
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:52,358
He knows I’m heartbroken.

14
00:00:55,196 --> 00:00:56,439
Does he sleep here?

15
00:00:59,119 --> 00:00:59,820
Um.

16
00:01:01,224 --> 00:01:02,311
Just sleep.

17
00:01:02,734 --> 00:01:03,639
Nothing more than that.

18
00:01:05,337 --> 00:01:06,432
I didn't ask.

19
00:01:07,326 --> 00:01:08,403
I wanted you to know.

20
00:01:16,148 --> 00:01:17,071
So…

21
00:01:17,768 --> 00:01:18,845
Why did you come here?

22
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,960
I brought you gifts from my moms.

23
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,434
I'm leaving.

24
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,035
Are you giving me a second chance?

25
00:01:39,634 --> 00:01:41,077
Chance? Really, Top?

26
00:01:42,406 --> 00:01:44,512
You still have your ex over.

27
00:01:45,655 --> 00:01:47,257
It's nothing.

28
00:01:47,257 --> 00:01:48,939
I can be friends with my exes.

29
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:55,349
Mew.

30
00:01:56,514 --> 00:01:57,997
You're my top priority.

31
00:02:02,152 --> 00:02:03,027
What do you want me to do?

32
00:02:03,504 --> 00:02:04,629
Should I ask him to leave?

33
00:02:05,147 --> 00:02:05,984
Don't.

34
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:07,840
I'm the one who should go.

35
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,336
But I want you to stay.

36
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,644
I choose you.

37
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,391
I've missed you, Mew.

38
00:02:41,753 --> 00:02:42,777
Ahem.

39
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:46,167
Food is ready.

40
00:02:50,153 --> 00:02:51,022
I'm leaving.

41
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:52,657
Hold on, Mew.

42
00:02:53,196 --> 00:02:54,640
I made some for you.

43
00:02:55,066 --> 00:02:56,217
You should stay and join us.

44
00:02:57,732 --> 00:02:59,652
Top told me so much about you.

45
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,477
I'd like to know more about you.

46
00:04:16,364 --> 00:04:17,197
Here.

47
00:04:18,446 --> 00:04:19,889
I got you the information.

48
00:04:20,183 --> 00:04:22,713
The rehabs in and out of Bangkok.

49
00:04:22,713 --> 00:04:24,336
So many programs to choose from.

50
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,575
Some rehabs are just like resorts.

51
00:04:26,575 --> 00:04:27,500
Take your pick.

52
00:04:29,273 --> 00:04:30,504
No, I'm not going.

53
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,962
I'm not addicted to alcohol.

54
00:04:33,676 --> 00:04:35,358
I can stop whenever I want.

55
00:04:37,933 --> 00:04:41,339
You have to sip all the time. That's not addiction?

56
00:04:42,765 --> 00:04:43,916
What are you afraid of?

57
00:04:47,022 --> 00:04:49,818
Are you doing this to make your dad feel guilty about your mom?

58
00:04:51,757 --> 00:04:55,960
To solve the problem, you must first accept that there is one.

59
00:04:57,097 --> 00:04:58,964
Who are you to analyze me? A shrink?

60
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,585
How about you deal with your own problem, Sand?

61
00:05:03,649 --> 00:05:07,426
What about your dad? You can't even tell him you're his son.

62
00:05:07,585 --> 00:05:08,385
So?

63
00:05:08,645 --> 00:05:10,539
Without a father, I have no problem.

64
00:05:10,539 --> 00:05:14,195
But without alcohol, look, your hands start shaking.

65
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,630
You get fired up easily when I try to reason with you.

66
00:05:17,069 --> 00:05:19,069
You should get a liver function test sometimes.

67
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:20,841
I think the AST is as high as your ego.

68
00:05:25,961 --> 00:05:27,165
Tell me, Sand.

69
00:05:28,627 --> 00:05:30,441
What will you get if I quit drinking?

70
00:05:30,683 --> 00:05:32,099
Why are you so pushy?

71
00:05:40,563 --> 00:05:42,563
I just don't want to sing at your funeral.

72
00:06:14,632 --> 00:06:15,376
Mew.

73
00:06:16,119 --> 00:06:17,030
Is the food okay?

74
00:06:19,773 --> 00:06:20,764
It is.

75
00:06:22,037 --> 00:06:23,046
I'm sorry.

76
00:06:23,272 --> 00:06:24,848
I didn't know we'd have a guest.

77
00:06:25,195 --> 00:06:27,195
I just made it the way Top likes it.

78
00:06:29,267 --> 00:06:30,129
It's alright.

79
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,348
Indifferent taste.

80
00:06:37,154 --> 00:06:39,234
So are you guys back together?

81
00:06:51,093 --> 00:06:52,026
I'm happy for you.

82
00:06:52,238 --> 00:06:54,154
Top always called me and said

83
00:06:54,487 --> 00:06:57,654
‘I love him so much. What should I do?’

84
00:06:57,654 --> 00:06:58,666
‘I was wrong.’

85
00:06:59,337 --> 00:07:00,621
He was crying.

86
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:02,925
Hey.

87
00:07:03,562 --> 00:07:04,913
It wasn't that bad.

88
00:07:05,374 --> 00:07:06,162
You are exaggerating.

89
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:07,745
I'm not.

90
00:07:08,162 --> 00:07:10,600
You told me you loved him so much.

91
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,442
You never loved anyone like this before.

92
00:07:13,698 --> 00:07:16,892
I get him though now that I see you in person.

93
00:07:17,563 --> 00:07:19,483
You are so cute.

94
00:07:19,592 --> 00:07:20,849
You're totally his type.

95
00:07:21,444 --> 00:07:22,887
Like an upgraded version of me.

96
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,696
Here. Let me get you some.

97
00:07:46,751 --> 00:07:47,697
How's it going, Nick?

98
00:07:48,751 --> 00:07:49,672
Are you okay?

99
00:07:50,874 --> 00:07:51,746
Here, Dan.

100
00:07:52,197 --> 00:07:53,325
Have a look.

101
00:07:53,325 --> 00:07:58,223
I made an initial design but am unsure if it fits the customer's requirements.

102
00:08:03,102 --> 00:08:06,243
I think it's okay.

103
00:08:06,243 --> 00:08:10,685
But can you make the wings whiter just to give the customer more options?

104
00:08:10,844 --> 00:08:12,236
The rest…

105
00:08:13,372 --> 00:08:14,682
It's all fine. I like it.

106
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:16,814
Alright, let me try.

107
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,891
Sorry, Nick.

108
00:08:23,283 --> 00:08:25,071
I make you work overtime every day.

109
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:27,388
I think I'm a workaholic.

110
00:08:27,728 --> 00:08:29,728
Come on. It's okay.

111
00:08:29,728 --> 00:08:31,076
It's good to have you.

112
00:08:31,346 --> 00:08:32,800
You fulfilled my dream.

113
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,057
Otherwise, I would just live goallessly.

114
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:38,760
And the…

115
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:44,783
About the night we kissed,

116
00:08:44,783 --> 00:08:46,040
I'm sorry.

117
00:08:46,173 --> 00:08:47,280
I was driven by alcohol.

118
00:08:47,699 --> 00:08:49,540
It's totally fine.

119
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,280
Just chill.

120
00:08:50,802 --> 00:08:51,756
The mood was right.

121
00:08:53,454 --> 00:08:54,394
The mood was right?

122
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:59,951
What does that mean? We don't have to care about the kiss?

123
00:09:00,801 --> 00:09:02,120
What a player.

124
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,716
Oh please, Dan.

125
00:09:03,716 --> 00:09:05,056
Don’t act naive.

126
00:09:05,056 --> 00:09:06,161
You're a player too.

127
00:09:08,036 --> 00:09:09,144
Seriously, though.

128
00:09:09,648 --> 00:09:15,208
We can kiss or have sex.

129
00:09:16,293 --> 00:09:17,175
We don't need to worry about it.

130
00:09:17,944 --> 00:09:19,619
We will part anyway in the end.

131
00:09:22,858 --> 00:09:25,960
It's not always the case.

132
00:09:26,561 --> 00:09:29,489
I'm not judging those who just want to have fun though.

133
00:09:45,837 --> 00:09:48,792
I don't know what you've been through.

134
00:09:50,441 --> 00:09:52,680
He might have mistreated you after sex.

135
00:09:53,531 --> 00:09:54,868
But for me,

136
00:09:55,697 --> 00:09:58,015
kisses and sex,

137
00:09:58,822 --> 00:10:03,978
when done with someone I have feelings for, it just feels so good.

138
00:11:19,337 --> 00:11:20,126
Want some donuts?

139
00:11:22,513 --> 00:11:23,326
No.

140
00:11:30,786 --> 00:11:31,694
One bite.

141
00:11:35,434 --> 00:11:36,181
Come on.

142
00:11:36,861 --> 00:11:37,650
Yum

143
00:11:38,976 --> 00:11:39,869
Yum

144
00:11:53,403 --> 00:11:54,473
About the rehab,

145
00:11:57,046 --> 00:11:58,321
I can do it for you.

146
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:00,181
On one condition.

147
00:12:01,268 --> 00:12:02,297
What condition?

148
00:12:06,907 --> 00:12:08,562
If you think I'm a coward,

149
00:12:09,659 --> 00:12:12,402
then show me how brave people are.

150
00:12:15,342 --> 00:12:17,395
Do you dare go to your dad and tell him you're his son?

151
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,818
And how's this relevant to me and my dad?

152
00:12:19,818 --> 00:12:20,537
Well.

153
00:12:20,845 --> 00:12:25,471
I just want to know how dauntless people do things.

154
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:30,040
You go to that bar often because you want to tell him who you are, don't you?

155
00:12:30,081 --> 00:12:31,365
But you're just afraid.

156
00:12:31,858 --> 00:12:32,665
Right?

157
00:12:36,909 --> 00:12:38,102
Do you have the guts?

158
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:41,359
Sure.

159
00:12:41,624 --> 00:12:42,795
I will show you.

160
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:05,734
Atom.

161
00:13:06,001 --> 00:13:07,550
Why are you sitting here all alone?

162
00:13:08,057 --> 00:13:08,995
Why don't you go upstairs?

163
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,836
Not sleepy.

164
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,412
You can go ahead.

165
00:13:19,505 --> 00:13:21,150
Are you still sad about Praew?

166
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:24,632
Whatever it is, you can tell me.

167
00:13:29,011 --> 00:13:29,902
It's not about that.

168
00:13:31,467 --> 00:13:33,849
Getting my heart broken by a girl won't kill me.

169
00:13:36,167 --> 00:13:37,133
What is it about then?

170
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:42,875
I can't help but be upset that you never tell me anything but always tell Boston.

171
00:13:43,543 --> 00:13:45,437
I seriously want to know how bad this is.

172
00:13:45,437 --> 00:13:46,246
Come on. Shoot.

173
00:13:53,811 --> 00:13:56,686
If I tell you, don't yell at me.

174
00:13:57,134 --> 00:13:57,916
I won't.

175
00:13:58,314 --> 00:13:59,532
You can let me know.

176
00:14:05,336 --> 00:14:07,280
Ton tricked me to his house and took my nude photos.

177
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:08,638
What?

178
00:14:09,991 --> 00:14:11,117
Is that true?

179
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:13,975
It is.

180
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:20,422
On Halloween night, he asked me to go home with him and tricked me into sleeping with him.

181
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:22,860
He asked to take my photos.

182
00:14:23,525 --> 00:14:25,658
He said he wanted to keep them.

183
00:14:27,854 --> 00:14:30,729
Wait. So you and Ton slept together?

184
00:14:31,812 --> 00:14:32,565
Um.

185
00:14:34,199 --> 00:14:35,483
But I was so drunk.

186
00:14:35,961 --> 00:14:37,377
I couldn't remember much.

187
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,849
But he was the one who started it all.

188
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:47,680
He also threatened to have me sleeping with him again.

189
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,327
If I don't do as he says, he will post my photos online.

190
00:14:56,884 --> 00:14:58,354
I don't know what to do.

191
00:14:59,868 --> 00:15:00,739
I'm so embarrassed.

192
00:15:01,296 --> 00:15:02,637
This is so embarrassing, Cheum.

193
00:15:07,177 --> 00:15:08,381
It's okay.

194
00:15:09,521 --> 00:15:10,725
Don't be embarrassed.

195
00:15:11,603 --> 00:15:14,240
I will take care of this for you.

196
00:15:25,586 --> 00:15:27,586
How far is this filthy asshole willing to go?

197
00:15:28,589 --> 00:15:30,589
His filthiness is just infinite.

198
00:15:30,851 --> 00:15:32,851
His friend’s boyfriend and now his friend’s little brother.

199
00:15:33,848 --> 00:15:37,273
To me, he isn’t my friend anymore.

200
00:15:41,484 --> 00:15:42,728
Very cute.

201
00:15:44,504 --> 00:15:45,486
Next pose.

202
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:52,474
Ton, you asshole.

203
00:15:54,884 --> 00:15:56,680
What the hell are you doing in my house?

204
00:15:56,931 --> 00:15:59,716
To talk to you about the fact that you slept with my little brother.

205
00:16:04,087 --> 00:16:05,476
Can you wait inside that room?

206
00:16:05,476 --> 00:16:06,729
I will have a word with my friends.

207
00:16:06,962 --> 00:16:07,848
Sure.

208
00:16:12,103 --> 00:16:14,290
You tricked people here and took their nude photos again?

209
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:16,221
Nude photos, my ass. I’m taking portraits.

210
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,970
You took my brother’s photos too, right?

211
00:16:21,691 --> 00:16:23,138
What a nasty bastard!

212
00:16:23,628 --> 00:16:25,628
You tricked him into sleeping with you and blackmailed him.

213
00:16:25,628 --> 00:16:26,947
What the hell are you talking about?

214
00:16:26,947 --> 00:16:28,280
I didn’t trick him.

215
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,242
He’s the one that asked to sleep with me.

216
00:16:30,242 --> 00:16:32,398
He also asked me to take his photos.

217
00:16:32,398 --> 00:16:34,119
And there weren’t nude photos.

218
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:35,120
I don’t believe you.

219
00:16:35,473 --> 00:16:36,920
Atom has always liked girls.

220
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,058
What did you do to him?

221
00:16:38,058 --> 00:16:39,613
I didn’t do anything.

222
00:16:39,613 --> 00:16:41,526
He suddenly wanted to try men.

223
00:16:41,526 --> 00:16:43,044
I just responded to his request.

224
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:44,875
But that’s your friend’s little brother, Ton.

225
00:16:46,051 --> 00:16:46,946
Ray.

226
00:16:47,528 --> 00:16:49,210
Don’t be innocent.

227
00:16:49,564 --> 00:16:53,135
This asshole sleeps with anything that breathes.

228
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,850
Where are the photos?

229
00:16:55,345 --> 00:16:56,763
Show me.

230
00:17:14,935 --> 00:17:16,004
Hey!

231
00:17:30,459 --> 00:17:32,086
How could you do this to my brother?

232
00:17:33,145 --> 00:17:35,145
He’s so frazzled right now.

233
00:17:35,145 --> 00:17:36,043
Cheum.

234
00:17:36,423 --> 00:17:37,696
Listen to me.

235
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,370
Your brother asked me to take these photos.

236
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:42,316
I never intended to show them to anyone.

237
00:17:42,756 --> 00:17:44,523
I even wanted to give them to him.

238
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,672
I confirm

239
00:17:46,672 --> 00:17:48,888
I wasn’t the one who started this.

240
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,696
I might be filthy

241
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:54,130
but not filthy enough to blackmail people to sleep with me.

242
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:55,022
Are you sure?

243
00:17:56,068 --> 00:17:57,283
I’ll let you say it again.

244
00:18:00,081 --> 00:18:01,965
It doesn’t matter who started it.

245
00:18:04,801 --> 00:18:06,074
He’s my brother.

246
00:18:07,216 --> 00:18:09,216
You’ve known him since we were first-year students.

247
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:16,010
Get out of this project.

248
00:18:17,772 --> 00:18:19,859
Find your own way to graduate.

249
00:18:21,651 --> 00:18:23,069
And we…

250
00:18:25,632 --> 00:18:27,370
will forget we were once friends with you.

251
00:19:11,869 --> 00:19:12,797
Why did you come here?

252
00:19:19,459 --> 00:19:20,938
I want to know for sure if

253
00:19:22,763 --> 00:19:24,123
I still have a chance.

254
00:19:33,311 --> 00:19:34,816
You know it, don't you?

255
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:38,497
That I still love you.

256
00:19:41,283 --> 00:19:42,614
Do you?

257
00:19:48,076 --> 00:19:49,465
I love and hate you.

258
00:19:50,535 --> 00:19:51,546
Do you get it?

259
00:19:52,811 --> 00:19:54,346
Which one is more?

260
00:20:10,983 --> 00:20:12,721
You can just chase me away right now

261
00:20:15,157 --> 00:20:17,012
if you hate me so much that you don't want to see me again.

262
00:20:19,633 --> 00:20:27,451
I promise you will never see me again wherever you go from now on.

263
00:20:37,814 --> 00:20:38,770
Wait.

264
00:20:53,428 --> 00:20:55,021
How can I be sure

265
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:56,972
that you will not do shit to me again

266
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,525
if I give you a second chance?

267
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:03,234
You won't believe anything I say right now.

268
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,155
But I will prove to you

269
00:21:10,195 --> 00:21:12,195
that I will never hurt you again.

270
00:21:16,086 --> 00:21:17,242
I will not lie to you,

271
00:21:19,388 --> 00:21:20,632
hide anything from you,

272
00:21:22,341 --> 00:21:23,497
or cheat on you.

273
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:25,926
What about Boeing?

274
00:21:27,141 --> 00:21:28,530
Is he going to be a problem?

275
00:21:28,727 --> 00:21:30,145
Of course, not.

276
00:21:32,466 --> 00:21:33,569
You can trust me.

277
00:21:36,827 --> 00:21:37,724
Okay.

278
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:41,635
If you blow it again this time,

279
00:21:42,412 --> 00:21:44,936
I'll blame myself for being dumb enough to trust you.

280
00:22:04,115 --> 00:22:04,980
Hey!

281
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,305
I needed that.

282
00:22:34,169 --> 00:22:35,151
Is that your dad?

283
00:22:36,802 --> 00:22:37,871
Um.

284
00:22:38,136 --> 00:22:39,554
My mom told me.

285
00:22:39,554 --> 00:22:41,444
I tried to search for more info on him

286
00:22:41,444 --> 00:22:43,231
and found out he is a musician here.

287
00:22:44,632 --> 00:22:46,021
You come here regularly

288
00:22:46,021 --> 00:22:47,272
but you never talk to him.

289
00:22:47,571 --> 00:22:48,640
Why do you come then?

290
00:22:51,222 --> 00:22:52,378
I have no idea.

291
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,738
It's like I see some parts of me in him.

292
00:22:59,495 --> 00:23:00,586
Like the music part?

293
00:23:01,284 --> 00:23:02,193
Um.

294
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,840
And we are both romantic.

295
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,941
Look at the way he plays.

296
00:23:22,531 --> 00:23:23,484
Sand.

297
00:23:24,175 --> 00:23:25,151
He's coming this way.

298
00:23:26,606 --> 00:23:29,899
If you dare tell him, I'll go to rehab for you.

299
00:23:31,565 --> 00:23:32,328
Do you have the guts?

300
00:23:36,954 --> 00:23:37,987
Hi, sir.

301
00:23:39,153 --> 00:23:40,222
Hey, guys.

302
00:23:40,797 --> 00:23:42,361
You play so well.

303
00:23:42,499 --> 00:23:44,004
I'm a big fan.

304
00:23:44,434 --> 00:23:45,503
Thank you.

305
00:23:45,962 --> 00:23:47,700
My name is Ray.

306
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,052
And this is my friend Sand.

307
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:52,837
He told me a lot about you so I came to see you play with my own eyes.

308
00:23:52,837 --> 00:23:54,277
I'm flattered.

309
00:23:54,277 --> 00:23:55,455
My name is Sun.

310
00:23:56,651 --> 00:23:58,156
Enjoy your night.

311
00:23:58,156 --> 00:23:59,010
Will you excuse me?

312
00:24:02,291 --> 00:24:03,082
Sir.

313
00:24:04,682 --> 00:24:05,542
Yes?

314
00:24:07,918 --> 00:24:09,220
I've got something to tell you.

315
00:24:18,522 --> 00:24:19,690
The truth is…

316
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:21,671
My friend wants to learn how to play saxophone with you.

317
00:24:23,683 --> 00:24:26,643
In that case, you must come in the daytime.

318
00:24:26,643 --> 00:24:27,850
I can teach you then.

319
00:24:28,642 --> 00:24:29,511
Yes, sir.

320
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:30,865
Bye now.

321
00:24:30,865 --> 00:24:31,922
Thank you so much.

322
00:24:35,222 --> 00:24:36,495
Why did you interrupt me?

323
00:24:37,448 --> 00:24:39,448
I was about to tell him like you asked.

324
00:24:40,954 --> 00:24:42,779
I could see that you were brave enough to do it.

325
00:24:43,714 --> 00:24:48,536
Tell him or not, I'll leave it to your own discretion.

326
00:24:48,536 --> 00:24:49,826
Shouldn't be forced by me.

327
00:24:59,366 --> 00:25:03,053
So does this mean you are still going to rehab?

328
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,209
Um.

329
00:25:06,587 --> 00:25:07,516
Yes.

330
00:25:08,615 --> 00:25:09,771
For you.

331
00:25:10,492 --> 00:25:11,881
Not for me.

332
00:25:11,881 --> 00:25:13,231
For yourself.

333
00:25:16,436 --> 00:25:18,436
Then this will be the last glass

334
00:25:18,953 --> 00:25:20,837
before I change to the new Ray.

335
00:25:22,495 --> 00:25:23,318
Cheers.

336
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:37,450
World!

337
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:39,561
So the quiz for this round is in the category 'World'.

338
00:25:39,561 --> 00:25:41,382
Anything that happens in this world.

339
00:25:41,382 --> 00:25:44,021
Geography, politics, history, anything.

340
00:25:44,021 --> 00:25:46,386
Bring back your childhood knowledge.

341
00:25:46,386 --> 00:25:48,578
Sai, prepare to give them shots.

342
00:25:48,578 --> 00:25:50,298
One correct answer will get you one shot.

343
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:53,303
The winning table will even get 50% off.

344
00:25:54,808 --> 00:25:56,081
The first question is here.

345
00:25:56,371 --> 00:25:59,767
Name the capital city of Australia.

346
00:26:01,629 --> 00:26:02,570
Canberra.

347
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:03,751
Canberra?

348
00:26:03,751 --> 00:26:05,933
That's correct.

349
00:26:05,933 --> 00:26:07,233
Serve him a shot.

350
00:26:08,291 --> 00:26:10,730
He's a regular here.

351
00:26:11,257 --> 00:26:12,413
You answer the questions.

352
00:26:12,413 --> 00:26:14,054
I take care of the drinks.

353
00:26:14,479 --> 00:26:15,810
I would have gotten it wrong if I answered that.

354
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:17,021
I always thought it was Sydney.

355
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:21,355
Sydney is the biggest city, not the capital.

356
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:25,303
Let's continue.

357
00:26:25,303 --> 00:26:28,274
What's the capital city of Türkiye?

358
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:30,206
Ankara.

359
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:31,752
You sure about that?

360
00:26:32,779 --> 00:26:34,779
That's correct.

361
00:26:34,779 --> 00:26:35,955
Wow!

362
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:38,661
Are you going to answer all the questions by yourself?

363
00:26:38,891 --> 00:26:40,775
Let's move on to the next one.

364
00:26:40,775 --> 00:26:44,360
What's the capital city of Brazil?

365
00:26:46,019 --> 00:26:47,490
Rio de Janeiro.

366
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:49,298
Rio de Janeiro?

367
00:26:49,815 --> 00:26:51,815
That's incorrect. Boo!

368
00:26:51,815 --> 00:26:53,205
You're wrong this time, Mew.

369
00:26:53,205 --> 00:26:55,014
That is incorrect.

370
00:26:55,014 --> 00:26:56,092
You know the answer back there?

371
00:26:58,108 --> 00:26:59,410
Can I answer that?

372
00:27:05,641 --> 00:27:07,496
You're hot. You're allowed.

373
00:27:07,496 --> 00:27:08,601
Brasilia.

374
00:27:09,048 --> 00:27:10,844
Brazil's capital city is Brasilia.

375
00:27:11,211 --> 00:27:12,196
Brasilia?

376
00:27:12,807 --> 00:27:14,290
That is…

377
00:27:14,873 --> 00:27:16,728
correct!

378
00:27:16,728 --> 00:27:19,141
Give the hot guy with glasses one shot.

379
00:27:21,533 --> 00:27:23,795
I get why you said Rio.

380
00:27:23,795 --> 00:27:24,849
It's a famous city.

381
00:27:25,028 --> 00:27:26,883
And it used to be the capital city.

382
00:27:27,196 --> 00:27:28,614
But that's been changed a long time ago.

383
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,609
Can I join you guys tonight?

384
00:27:38,609 --> 00:27:40,905
I used to play quiz night here with my ex all the time.

385
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,240
Ah, I didn't mean Top.

386
00:27:48,815 --> 00:27:50,290
I meant my other ex.

387
00:27:51,302 --> 00:27:53,069
Top doesn't like to repeat things he's done.

388
00:27:55,536 --> 00:27:58,800
Alright. This one is going to be difficult.

389
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,330
Prepare to answer.

390
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:03,698
What's the full name of Thailand’s capital city?

391
00:28:09,567 --> 00:28:14,156
Krung Thep Mahanakhon Amon Rattanakosin Mahinthara Ayuthaya Mahadilok Phop Noppharat…

392
00:28:14,156 --> 00:28:17,805
Ratchathani Burirom Udomratchaniwet Mahasathan…

393
00:28:17,805 --> 00:28:21,248
Amon Piman Awatan Sathit Sakkathattiya Witsanukam Prasit.

394
00:28:21,648 --> 00:28:22,650
Gosh!

395
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:24,001
You guys are so precise.

396
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:27,265
Give them two shots. Go on.

397
00:28:27,265 --> 00:28:27,832
Here you go.

398
00:28:27,832 --> 00:28:29,363
Yeah.

399
00:28:29,903 --> 00:28:31,554
You're both great.

400
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,440
Top, you always date smart people.

401
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:12,930
[Snooping on my Insta?]

402
00:29:17,361 --> 00:29:19,361
[I just like that photo.]

403
00:29:23,104 --> 00:29:26,559
[I'm actually snooping on your Insta too. Hey, we both like plants.]

404
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:30,243
[Can I go check out the plants in your room someday?]

405
00:29:52,774 --> 00:29:54,309
Please look out for this Kinky Head.

406
00:29:54,309 --> 00:29:56,089
He has always loved watching animations.

407
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,792
I used to think it was useless.

408
00:29:58,792 --> 00:30:02,423
Who would have thought he’d make animations when he grows up?

409
00:30:02,423 --> 00:30:03,592
Come on, Dad.

410
00:30:03,592 --> 00:30:04,973
Stop calling me Kinky Head.

411
00:30:04,973 --> 00:30:06,702
It's embarrassing.

412
00:30:06,702 --> 00:30:08,668
Don't worry about him, sir.

413
00:30:08,668 --> 00:30:10,493
Mr. Kinky Head here is so skillful.

414
00:30:10,493 --> 00:30:12,289
We will go internationally together.

415
00:30:12,289 --> 00:30:13,108
Dan.

416
00:30:13,241 --> 00:30:14,426
Don't play with him.

417
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:17,186
Don't laugh, Dad.

418
00:30:17,186 --> 00:30:18,838
Go to the back of the shop.

419
00:30:18,838 --> 00:30:20,958
I'm not needed anymore, huh?

420
00:30:20,958 --> 00:30:22,575
I'll take care of the front.

421
00:30:23,561 --> 00:30:24,776
Why did you chase him away?

422
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:28,426
He always says something embarrassing about me.

423
00:30:29,102 --> 00:30:31,800
If you'd seen me before, you would have teased me too.

424
00:30:32,666 --> 00:30:34,491
People I liked never liked me back.

425
00:30:34,491 --> 00:30:35,894
And no one wanted to hit on me.

426
00:30:37,436 --> 00:30:38,912
You look great now.

427
00:30:40,418 --> 00:30:45,793
By the way, are you hitting on anyone or being hit on by anyone?

428
00:30:49,826 --> 00:30:51,826
With this big makeover,

429
00:30:51,826 --> 00:30:53,641
of course, I am.

430
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:59,444
Can I hit on you too?

431
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:04,965
Didn't you get the clear answer that night at the office?

432
00:31:17,637 --> 00:31:19,637
Excuse me. I like to see some headphones.

433
00:31:21,633 --> 00:31:22,497
Ah.

434
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:24,535
This row.

435
00:31:26,044 --> 00:31:27,055
Well then.

436
00:31:28,101 --> 00:31:29,650
I'm going back to the office.

437
00:31:29,884 --> 00:31:31,054
Don't forget to turn in the work.

438
00:31:31,054 --> 00:31:31,884
Sure.

439
00:31:33,333 --> 00:31:34,373
See you, Dan.

440
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:00,052
Ton.

441
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:02,577
What’s up?

442
00:32:04,394 --> 00:32:05,386
Who was that?

443
00:32:05,561 --> 00:32:06,410
Your boyfriend?

444
00:32:10,111 --> 00:32:11,035
No.

445
00:32:11,522 --> 00:32:13,522
My older friend who hired me to work with him.

446
00:32:16,541 --> 00:32:18,134
I want a new phone case.

447
00:32:18,534 --> 00:32:19,461
Can you recommend one to me?

448
00:32:22,894 --> 00:32:24,752
They are on that shelf.

449
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:44,781
Which one do you like?

450
00:32:46,287 --> 00:32:47,589
Which one do you think is nice?

451
00:32:57,053 --> 00:32:58,170
This one is all right.

452
00:32:58,374 --> 00:32:59,868
It's dark. It suits you.

453
00:33:03,528 --> 00:33:04,485
I'll take this one.

454
00:33:04,485 --> 00:33:05,528
I want my screen protector changed too.

455
00:33:06,597 --> 00:33:07,899
The glass one, just the same?

456
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,865
Just any kind.

457
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,335
But make sure it’s durable.

458
00:33:13,101 --> 00:33:14,290
I don't usually take good care of what I own.

459
00:33:18,411 --> 00:33:20,149
Be careful next time.

460
00:33:21,626 --> 00:33:23,161
Some things can't be replaced.

461
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:29,430
Um.

462
00:33:30,877 --> 00:33:32,615
I'll take good care of it from now on.

463
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,826
You can have a seat and wait

464
00:33:58,826 --> 00:33:59,730
while I'm working on it.

465
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:00,813
Um.

466
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:02,895
You don't have to hurry.

467
00:34:02,895 --> 00:34:03,870
I've got time today.

468
00:34:20,459 --> 00:34:23,844
I'm glad you still keep the plane model I bought you.

469
00:34:25,651 --> 00:34:26,793
You're even showcasing it.

470
00:34:27,955 --> 00:34:29,036
Do you want it back?

471
00:34:29,772 --> 00:34:30,690
You can.

472
00:34:32,397 --> 00:34:33,133
Nah.

473
00:34:34,834 --> 00:34:35,863
I don't take back what I gave.

474
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:40,717
Mew asked me where that model was from.

475
00:34:46,907 --> 00:34:48,116
What's your answer?

476
00:34:50,729 --> 00:34:52,309
I told him honestly that it was my ex's.

477
00:34:53,167 --> 00:34:54,241
I didn't hide it from him.

478
00:34:59,583 --> 00:35:00,509
Have you…

479
00:35:01,656 --> 00:35:03,259
been with anyone for more than three months yet?

480
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,488
Are you still keeping that record?

481
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:10,038
Not yet.

482
00:35:10,746 --> 00:35:12,276
But with Mew, I might get there.

483
00:35:12,737 --> 00:35:16,518
I'm sure if he stops being mad at me, we can make it long-term.

484
00:35:26,911 --> 00:35:27,614
Boeing,

485
00:35:28,579 --> 00:35:30,445
thanks for keeping me company.

486
00:35:31,396 --> 00:35:33,396
You're the friend that I always think of.

487
00:35:36,281 --> 00:35:38,259
Only when you can't sleep, huh?

488
00:35:40,197 --> 00:35:40,966
Look.

489
00:35:41,733 --> 00:35:45,586
Didn’t we agree to be each other's comfort zone the day we split up?

490
00:35:47,466 --> 00:35:49,466
I guess you are feeling comfortable now.

491
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:51,423
You don't need me anymore, right?

492
00:35:59,576 --> 00:36:01,279
I don't want to have a fight with Mew again.

493
00:36:02,581 --> 00:36:03,790
I don't want to blow my chance.

494
00:36:16,983 --> 00:36:19,453
When did you start drinking, may I ask?

495
00:36:23,129 --> 00:36:24,461
I drink when I drink, doc.

496
00:36:26,607 --> 00:36:29,621
Does anyone in your family have a history of alcoholism?

497
00:36:33,009 --> 00:36:34,786
Why are you asking so many questions?

498
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,762
Just say what you want me to do.

499
00:36:37,075 --> 00:36:38,259
You’re wasting my time.

500
00:36:50,842 --> 00:36:52,446
How boring.

501
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:54,434
I feel like I was in there forever.

502
00:36:55,192 --> 00:36:56,499
Come on.

503
00:36:56,499 --> 00:36:57,883
One little step at a time.

504
00:36:59,702 --> 00:37:01,108
You want to join the session with me?

505
00:37:01,941 --> 00:37:03,130
Keep me entertained.

506
00:37:03,748 --> 00:37:04,559
Jackass.

507
00:37:05,435 --> 00:37:07,435
I'm not an alcohol addict like you are.

508
00:37:07,608 --> 00:37:08,772
I don't have to do it.

509
00:37:09,684 --> 00:37:11,016
Speaking of addiction,

510
00:37:11,181 --> 00:37:12,884
I've never been addicted to anything in my life.

511
00:37:14,059 --> 00:37:15,045
You're addicted to me.

512
00:37:17,584 --> 00:37:18,941
You are addicted to me.

513
00:37:19,205 --> 00:37:23,035
Every time we meet, you're the one running towards me.

514
00:37:23,893 --> 00:37:24,507
Yeah?

515
00:37:24,507 --> 00:37:25,225
Um.

516
00:37:28,433 --> 00:37:31,571
If I'm addicted to you, I don't need rehab, right?

517
00:37:33,339 --> 00:37:35,265
I can be addicted to you for the rest of my life, can’t I?

518
00:37:35,438 --> 00:37:37,649
Um…

519
00:37:41,433 --> 00:37:43,136
Damn it, Ray.

520
00:37:43,136 --> 00:37:44,276
What are you doing?

521
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:45,547
What?

522
00:37:47,171 --> 00:37:49,765
Ray, back off. People are all over the place.

523
00:37:50,442 --> 00:37:51,997
Well, I'm addicted to you.

524
00:37:52,164 --> 00:37:55,104
The symptoms include a constant desire to hug and kiss you.

525
00:37:56,457 --> 00:37:57,257
Like this.

526
00:37:58,617 --> 00:38:00,312
Ray, stop it.

527
00:38:04,304 --> 00:38:05,463
Watch me.

528
00:38:05,998 --> 00:38:09,952
Once I'm not addicted to alcohol anymore, I'll be addicted to you full-time.

529
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:21,037
I brought you ivy.

530
00:38:23,847 --> 00:38:24,808
It's beautiful.

531
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:27,671
The plant has good meaning.

532
00:38:28,259 --> 00:38:30,803
It represents love and honesty.

533
00:38:37,285 --> 00:38:38,054
Thank you.

534
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,080
So…

535
00:38:42,698 --> 00:38:44,599
You came here just to give me the plant?

536
00:38:46,964 --> 00:38:49,187
I saw on your Insta that you like trees too.

537
00:38:50,105 --> 00:38:51,536
I just want us to be friends.

538
00:38:59,615 --> 00:39:00,873
Can we?

539
00:39:02,101 --> 00:39:03,582
Can I please be your friend?

540
00:39:09,269 --> 00:39:09,998
Of course, you can.

541
00:39:11,269 --> 00:39:12,268
No problem.

542
00:39:13,125 --> 00:39:17,079
Since I'm Top's ex, I'm afraid you don't want to be friends with me.

543
00:39:18,021 --> 00:39:19,393
I'm afraid you'd think I want him back.

544
00:39:25,626 --> 00:39:26,947
Do you want him back?

545
00:39:28,883 --> 00:39:29,701
No.

546
00:39:30,141 --> 00:39:31,076
I'm tired of him.

547
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:32,982
I'm tired of being his sleeping pills.

548
00:39:34,101 --> 00:39:35,730
Someone like Top is just…

549
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,796
selfish.

550
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:43,259
I can't help but wonder why a decent man like you would want him as your boyfriend.

551
00:39:47,139 --> 00:39:48,916
I am not that decent.

552
00:39:49,259 --> 00:39:50,591
How can you not?

553
00:39:51,607 --> 00:39:54,739
I heard Top slept with your friend.

554
00:39:55,331 --> 00:39:58,444
You have my respect for getting back together with him.

555
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,290
You're not picking at me, are you?

556
00:40:00,488 --> 00:40:01,521
I'm not.

557
00:40:02,363 --> 00:40:06,342
I just think you should be with someone better.

558
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,852
Be with the boyfriend who can give you a good night's sleep

559
00:40:10,871 --> 00:40:15,047
without worrying if he is sleeping with anyone else.

560
00:40:16,875 --> 00:40:18,459
Stop calling me Top's boyfriend.

561
00:40:18,682 --> 00:40:19,535
Oh!

562
00:40:21,588 --> 00:40:24,874
So you both are single?

563
00:40:29,823 --> 00:40:31,229
My chance is still open then.

564
00:40:34,609 --> 00:40:36,065
But you just said you didn't want him back.

565
00:40:38,112 --> 00:40:39,271
I wasn't talking about Top.

566
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,870
I was talking about you.

567
00:40:47,352 --> 00:40:50,317
I know Top is your first love.

568
00:40:51,246 --> 00:40:52,751
Must be hard for you to cut ties with him.

569
00:40:54,647 --> 00:40:56,870
But you still have lots of options.

570
00:41:09,619 --> 00:41:10,806
Boeing!

571
00:41:14,565 --> 00:41:15,675
Tell me honestly.

572
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:17,927
What do you really want?

573
00:41:21,505 --> 00:41:23,259
Don't you think giving him a chance is too easy?

574
00:41:24,115 --> 00:41:27,302
Isn't it better if he learns his lesson?

575
00:42:49,591 --> 00:42:51,566
Just take it. Don't feel bad.

576
00:42:52,874 --> 00:42:53,687
Here.

577
00:42:55,088 --> 00:42:58,259
I'm going to need your help eventually.

578
00:43:10,198 --> 00:43:11,184
Alright. I heard it.

579
00:43:11,184 --> 00:43:12,393
Damn it. Don't knock so hard.

580
00:43:13,466 --> 00:43:15,059
You're going to destroy my door.

581
00:43:16,586 --> 00:43:18,259
Damn you. You are ruining my door.

582
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:21,640
What the heck?

583
00:43:25,332 --> 00:43:26,282
What's wrong now?

584
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:29,187
Why are you frustrated?

585
00:43:30,121 --> 00:43:31,354
Is it a withdrawal symptom?

586
00:43:32,731 --> 00:43:36,314
You pushed me to go to rehab because my dad hired you to, right?

587
00:43:42,176 --> 00:43:43,259
Tell me.

588
00:43:44,365 --> 00:43:45,771
Did he hire you?

589
00:43:46,445 --> 00:43:47,504
How much did he pay you?

590
00:43:48,914 --> 00:43:50,325
Was it a big pay?

591
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:52,320
Tell me.

592
00:43:53,087 --> 00:43:54,296
Say it.

593
00:43:58,260 --> 00:43:59,493
Well, say it.

594
00:43:59,831 --> 00:44:00,645
Ray, will you calm down?

595
00:44:00,645 --> 00:44:01,831
Calm down, my ass!

596
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:05,818
Did he pay you?

597
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:07,211
Tell me!

598
00:44:07,539 --> 00:44:09,267
Just tell me.

599
00:44:11,559 --> 00:44:12,916
Just f*cking tell me!

600
00:44:12,916 --> 00:44:14,187
Yes! He hired me.

601
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:24,476
When?

602
00:44:29,546 --> 00:44:31,634
The day you crashed your car.

603
00:44:46,311 --> 00:44:48,039
So you've been deceiving me.

604
00:44:49,761 --> 00:44:51,984
All these times we’ve been happy together.

605
00:44:51,984 --> 00:44:54,849
Everything was a lie, right?

606
00:44:55,211 --> 00:44:58,151
Actually, you just want my dad's money.

607
00:44:58,876 --> 00:45:00,554
It has nothing to do with the money.

608
00:45:01,609 --> 00:45:06,280
Everything I've done is because I care about you.

609
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:07,863
That's bullshit!!

610
00:45:13,407 --> 00:45:15,531
You do anything for money.

611
00:45:19,526 --> 00:45:21,007
Seriously, Ray?

612
00:45:22,071 --> 00:45:23,576
Do you really think so?

613
00:45:24,878 --> 00:45:26,579
Do you think I’m a man with no dignity?

614
00:45:26,579 --> 00:45:27,517
Damn right, you are.

615
00:45:30,174 --> 00:45:32,174
You duped me into trusting you.

616
00:45:32,174 --> 00:45:35,428
You tricked me into believing you. You slept with me.

617
00:45:35,753 --> 00:45:39,509
You did all that because you wanted my dad's money.

618
00:45:45,164 --> 00:45:45,958
Ray.

619
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:51,813
If that's what you think,

620
00:45:53,873 --> 00:45:55,156
go ahead.

621
00:45:57,472 --> 00:46:03,726
But I want you to know that I did everything because I truly care about you.

622
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:07,893
You care about me?

623
00:46:11,598 --> 00:46:12,827
Are you crying?

624
00:46:13,432 --> 00:46:14,203
Really?

625
00:46:14,327 --> 00:46:15,860
Are you crying?

626
00:46:18,591 --> 00:46:20,591
You don't have the right to cry.

627
00:46:20,591 --> 00:46:22,543
I'm the one who should cry.

628
00:46:22,543 --> 00:46:25,278
I'm the one who should be upset.

629
00:46:25,447 --> 00:46:27,019
Not you.

630
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:30,873
You care about me, huh?

631
00:46:35,883 --> 00:46:37,699
Those are the liquor you make.

632
00:46:37,699 --> 00:46:40,710
You want me to quit drinking but you are selling liquor.

633
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:43,067
Do you think my life is going to be better if I'm with you?

634
00:46:43,067 --> 00:46:45,131
No. It's f*cking going down to hell.

635
00:47:01,937 --> 00:47:03,937
F*ck!!

636
00:48:11,245 --> 00:48:12,132
Mew.

637
00:48:12,132 --> 00:48:13,383
You're a lot better.

638
00:48:13,383 --> 00:48:14,551
When did you practice?

639
00:48:18,103 --> 00:48:20,326
People learn from their mistakes, don't they?

640
00:48:23,168 --> 00:48:25,975
Do you want to surf too?

641
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:28,500
I'm thinking Phuket or Khao Lak.

642
00:48:28,718 --> 00:48:29,900
We can make it our vacation.

643
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:30,718
Interested?

644
00:48:31,361 --> 00:48:32,430
I will think about it later.

645
00:48:33,209 --> 00:48:35,281
I don't want to make plans far ahead.

646
00:48:35,605 --> 00:48:37,143
We don't know what the future holds.

647
00:48:38,596 --> 00:48:39,824
What do you mean?

648
00:48:40,102 --> 00:48:41,383
What will happen in the future?

649
00:48:43,847 --> 00:48:44,984
Nothing.

650
00:48:45,475 --> 00:48:47,920
I just don't want to dream big.

651
00:48:48,451 --> 00:48:50,543
Let's just try to get through every day together.

652
00:48:53,078 --> 00:48:56,263
Isn't it record-breaking for you to date anyone for over three months?

653
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:02,556
I don't think we need to count days or months in a relationship.

654
00:49:02,713 --> 00:49:04,713
Just live our life happily together.

655
00:49:04,751 --> 00:49:08,031
But whatever you want to do or wherever you want to go, just let me know.

656
00:49:08,198 --> 00:49:09,245
I'll take you.

657
00:49:14,792 --> 00:49:16,013
How sweet.

658
00:49:16,013 --> 00:49:17,679
Hey! Boeing.

659
00:49:20,210 --> 00:49:21,570
I didn't think you would make it.

660
00:49:21,824 --> 00:49:24,436
Sorry. Bad traffic.

661
00:49:24,624 --> 00:49:25,928
But I must come.

662
00:49:26,475 --> 00:49:27,543
Since you invited me.

663
00:49:32,833 --> 00:49:37,254
I was talking to Boeing and told him we were wakeboarding.

664
00:49:37,254 --> 00:49:38,575
So I invited him along.

665
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:40,590
I hope you don't have a problem with that.

666
00:49:42,194 --> 00:49:43,554
Of course, I don't.

667
00:49:44,824 --> 00:49:46,268
The more, the merrier.

668
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:48,623
I used to come here with Top very often.

669
00:49:48,623 --> 00:49:50,594
He taught me how to balance myself on the board.

670
00:49:50,973 --> 00:49:55,143
But the more we played, the more the student outperformed the teacher.

671
00:50:00,411 --> 00:50:01,715
Should we compete, Top?

672
00:50:04,695 --> 00:50:05,529
Boeing,

673
00:50:06,225 --> 00:50:07,614
I'm still new.

674
00:50:08,043 --> 00:50:09,154
Teach me too.

675
00:50:09,543 --> 00:50:10,432
Sure.

676
00:50:11,523 --> 00:50:12,439
Do you want to go again?

677
00:50:13,523 --> 00:50:14,774
I just finished my round.

678
00:50:15,205 --> 00:50:16,423
I'll just wait up here.

679
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:22,390
Ready?

680
00:50:22,390 --> 00:50:22,960
I am.

681
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:23,657
Let's go.

682
00:50:23,657 --> 00:50:24,723
Don't leave me if I fall.

683
00:50:24,723 --> 00:50:25,253
I won't.

684
00:50:46,457 --> 00:50:47,233
Hey.

685
00:50:47,744 --> 00:50:49,271
Do you want to shower with me?

686
00:50:50,638 --> 00:50:52,972
Just like old times after we had sex.

687
00:50:53,744 --> 00:50:54,881
What do you want?

688
00:50:58,895 --> 00:51:00,088
I can’t?

689
00:51:00,745 --> 00:51:01,827
Why?

690
00:51:02,615 --> 00:51:03,476
Are you jealous?

691
00:51:04,255 --> 00:51:05,343
Possessive?

692
00:51:08,164 --> 00:51:10,164
You went to see Mew behind my back.

693
00:51:11,703 --> 00:51:13,023
That's not shady at all.

694
00:51:15,861 --> 00:51:16,748
So you're afraid.

695
00:51:18,769 --> 00:51:21,047
You think Mew and I plot something together.

696
00:51:21,047 --> 00:51:22,630
Don't think too much.

697
00:51:23,408 --> 00:51:25,408
We are just two people who talk

698
00:51:26,127 --> 00:51:27,783
and have common interests.

699
00:51:31,664 --> 00:51:32,373
Look.

700
00:51:33,124 --> 00:51:34,109
Tell me the truth.

701
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:38,423
You approached Mew to exact revenge on me, correct?

702
00:51:39,542 --> 00:51:41,542
I wanted that at first.

703
00:51:42,923 --> 00:51:46,759
But as time went by, I started to like Mew for real.

704
00:51:49,634 --> 00:51:54,194
A good guy like him shouldn't be with someone selfish like you.

705
00:51:54,846 --> 00:51:57,783
Will you be with him for three months and then ditch him like you did to me?

706
00:51:58,389 --> 00:51:59,526
Or what?

707
00:52:00,072 --> 00:52:01,738
Will you sleep with his friend again?

708
00:52:04,377 --> 00:52:05,229
Ah.

709
00:52:06,008 --> 00:52:06,878
One more thing.

710
00:52:08,451 --> 00:52:09,728
Mew and I kissed.

711
00:52:11,406 --> 00:52:13,406
I'll leave the rest to be his decision.

712
00:52:13,859 --> 00:52:17,528
He should know that there are a lot of good options available.

713
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:33,437
Can I drink with you?

714
00:52:34,239 --> 00:52:35,335
Why are you here?

715
00:52:36,810 --> 00:52:40,775
To have a beer with you.

716
00:52:52,421 --> 00:52:53,241
What's wrong?

717
00:52:57,025 --> 00:52:58,103
Don't butt in.

718
00:53:01,330 --> 00:53:02,617
I'm asking you nicely.

719
00:53:03,884 --> 00:53:04,792
What's wrong?

720
00:53:15,751 --> 00:53:16,704
My friends dumped me.

721
00:53:19,431 --> 00:53:20,561
Serve you right.

722
00:53:21,142 --> 00:53:22,684
Considering what you did.

723
00:53:24,298 --> 00:53:26,244
If you're here to add insult to injury, just leave.

724
00:53:30,235 --> 00:53:31,224
Fine.

725
00:53:31,669 --> 00:53:32,680
I'm sorry.

726
00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:34,120
I won’t say it.

727
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:44,543
Why does everyone hate me?

728
00:53:46,641 --> 00:53:48,947
Why can't I stop doing shit to people?

729
00:53:55,169 --> 00:53:58,282
Maybe you just want to be loved.

730
00:53:59,984 --> 00:54:01,177
You just don't know how.

731
00:54:04,601 --> 00:54:06,490
But why did you still love me?

732
00:54:08,455 --> 00:54:10,260
I did lots of nasty things to you.

733
00:54:31,469 --> 00:54:32,913
I guess I'm nasty too.

734
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:37,410
I wiretapped you and Top.

735
00:54:39,375 --> 00:54:40,707
Don't we deserve each other?

736
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:45,936
I missed you.

737
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:29,210
I missed you too.

738
00:55:32,451 --> 00:55:34,896
I missed you so damn much.

739
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:38,820
I miss you so much as well.

740
00:55:45,372 --> 00:55:47,372
Thank you for always staying by my side.

741
00:55:48,836 --> 00:55:50,641
Thank you for not leaving me.

742
00:56:46,858 --> 00:56:48,663
So you're not going back to rehab, are you?

743
00:57:04,044 --> 00:57:08,131
The court ordered you to do social work and stuff, did you do it?

744
00:57:11,184 --> 00:57:13,407
I will manage that on my own. Don't interfere.

745
00:57:13,869 --> 00:57:15,786
And don't ever hire anyone to help me again.

746
00:57:18,697 --> 00:57:22,366
Sand came to return the money.

747
00:57:25,077 --> 00:57:27,077
Can you help me with one thing?

748
00:57:31,285 --> 00:57:32,450
With what, sir?

749
00:57:34,415 --> 00:57:37,751
Make Ray go to alcohol rehab.

750
00:57:40,636 --> 00:57:42,998
I don't want him to die like his mom.

751
00:57:45,658 --> 00:57:47,074
He doesn't listen to me.

752
00:57:49,401 --> 00:57:51,290
He should at least listen to his friend.

753
00:57:56,343 --> 00:57:57,703
Please help.

754
00:57:59,585 --> 00:58:00,889
I can pay you.

755
00:58:04,017 --> 00:58:05,906
Make him quit drinking.

756
00:58:15,758 --> 00:58:18,259
He took the money because I forced him to.

757
00:58:22,935 --> 00:58:26,063
But the truth is he cares so much about you.

758
00:58:27,142 --> 00:58:31,090
He looked up all of the rehab centers and gave the info to me.

759
00:58:33,721 --> 00:58:34,914
I admired him.

760
00:58:36,028 --> 00:58:37,638
He seemed to live a tough life.

761
00:58:37,856 --> 00:58:39,160
So I gave him the money.

762
00:58:41,744 --> 00:58:43,048
Don't be mad at him.

763
00:58:44,652 --> 00:58:51,183
Someone who sincerely cares about you and wants nothing in return isn't easy to find.

764
00:59:17,475 --> 00:59:19,920
When did you start drinking, may I ask?

765
00:59:20,995 --> 00:59:22,216
In high school.

766
00:59:23,124 --> 00:59:24,957
But I don't think I'm an addict.

767
00:59:26,032 --> 00:59:27,559
I drink just to socialize with people.

768
00:59:28,439 --> 00:59:32,999
If you don't think you're an addict, then why did you come to rehab?

769
00:59:41,156 --> 00:59:42,488
Someone wanted me to come.

770
00:59:44,843 --> 00:59:46,732
May I ask you who?

771
00:59:52,899 --> 00:59:53,981
My friend.

772
00:59:55,304 --> 01:00:01,088
Your friend must be really important to you since you came here for him.

773
01:00:02,121 --> 01:00:04,733
You don't want to lose this friend of yours, do you?

774
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:14,571
Then slowly close your eyes

775
01:00:15,464 --> 01:00:18,772
and think about the reasons why you want to quit drinking.

776
01:00:20,064 --> 01:00:22,426
It can be anything.

777
01:00:24,242 --> 01:00:27,800
Some people want to quit drinking for themselves.

778
01:00:29,138 --> 01:00:32,696
Some want to quit for someone they love.

779
01:00:34,222 --> 01:00:39,561
If your reason is the latter one, imagine that person in front of you.

780
01:01:04,166 --> 01:01:05,259
Sand.

781
01:01:06,567 --> 01:01:07,557
I'm sorry.

782
01:01:16,481 --> 01:01:18,203
Can you please forgive me?

783
01:01:22,283 --> 01:01:23,532
I was stupid.

784
01:01:25,397 --> 01:01:27,397
But I want you to understand me.

785
01:01:29,473 --> 01:01:33,504
I was mad at you because I cared so much about you.

786
01:01:38,990 --> 01:01:44,468
You can be angry or hate me all you want.

787
01:01:46,890 --> 01:01:49,224
I know now that you want nothing from me.

788
01:01:53,744 --> 01:01:54,868
On this Earth,

789
01:01:58,429 --> 01:02:01,670
there's no one who's more caring or loving than you.

790
01:02:05,689 --> 01:02:08,162
Though I've been nothing but an asshole to you,

791
01:02:10,961 --> 01:02:12,405
you are always there for me.

792
01:02:17,987 --> 01:02:20,543
Sand, please understand me.

793
01:02:26,627 --> 01:02:31,409
Being with me requires some patience.

794
01:02:34,194 --> 01:02:38,281
But if you don't want to put up with me anymore, that's alright.

795
01:02:38,854 --> 01:02:39,991
I get you.

796
01:02:41,664 --> 01:02:44,109
No one can put up with me.

797
01:02:51,102 --> 01:02:53,102
But please know this, Sand.

798
01:02:56,935 --> 01:03:01,634
Ever since you walked into my life, I've been so happy.

799
01:03:02,527 --> 01:03:04,833
So damn happy, Sand.

800
01:03:23,429 --> 01:03:25,012
Thank you.

801
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:28,671
Thank you so much.

803
01:03:54,303 --> 01:03:55,056
Hey.

804
01:03:55,446 --> 01:03:56,387
Tell me.

805
01:03:56,725 --> 01:03:57,918
Are you taking revenge on me?

806
01:03:58,838 --> 01:04:01,478
I still can’t forget what he did to me, Mom.

807
01:04:01,478 --> 01:04:04,719
But I can tell you still care about him.

808
01:04:04,719 --> 01:04:07,137
You know that I’m going to live in New York, right?

809
01:04:07,384 --> 01:04:10,942
That’s why you don’t want a serious relationship with anyone, right?

810
01:04:11,868 --> 01:04:13,312
You might be an exception.

811
01:04:15,145 --> 01:04:19,143
Should we hit a music festival somewhere after I’m done with the rehab?

812
01:04:19,389 --> 01:04:21,194
I’m going to go get my passport issued right now.

813
01:04:21,867 --> 01:04:24,284
I know you’re with someone else now.

814
01:04:24,284 --> 01:04:26,137
But I’m willing to be a bad guy here.

815
01:04:26,248 --> 01:04:27,350
Tell me

816
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:29,962
if I still have a chance.
