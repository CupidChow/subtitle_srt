1
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,840
Why don’t you try Lasik?

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,190
Don’t use your eyes.

3
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:10,750
What are your senses telling you?

4
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:14,930
Besides me, are you fooling around with anyone else right now?

5
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:17,030
I have a few people I meet up with regularly.

6
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:20,000
Sand never brings his friends to see me here at all.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,550
I don’t think he’s just a friend.

8
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,240
I guess not.

9
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,330
I doubt it will work out between the two of you.

10
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:28,390
Ray’s whole ass is owned by Mew.

11
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,200
Jerk!

12
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,820
Ray! Enough.

13
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,810
Look.

14
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:06,910
This is me with my two mothers.

15
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,120
Cute, huh?

16
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,320
Two mothers?

17
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:11,650
Your mom likes women?

18
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:13,540
Yes.

19
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,020
This is my mom Bua.

20
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,810
She and my dad separated when I was very young.

21
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:24,000
She told me later that she had a crush on her friend.

22
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,070
So she broke up with Dad and moved in with Ning, my other mom.

23
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:29,970
They raised me together.

24
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:32,710
After a while, they moved out of town.

25
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:33,980
Opened a café.

26
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:35,400
You know what?

27
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:37,090
I’ve never seen them fight at all.

28
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,980
They are crazy about each other.

29
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,660
Sounds like you have a really warm family.

30
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,570
Unlike mine.

31
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:48,580
All my parents do is work.

32
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,020
They always left me to sleep alone as a kid.

33
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,440
I thought it was a good thing.

34
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,900
I got the freedom to do more things.

35
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:59,830
But after I heard about your family, I wanted to have that too.

36
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:09,120
They must be the reason I never felt deprived of love.

37
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:13,270
I even felt I didn’t need a lover.

38
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:16,890
If I needed love, I could just seek it from my friends or my moms.

39
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,710
That’s different.

40
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,590
Friends and family give different types of love.

41
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:25,750
And if you have a boyfriend, he will be as warm as this.

42
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:26,900
See?

43
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,970
This is not replaceable.

44
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:34,900
Top.

45
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:35,710
Hmm?

46
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:37,960
Alright, I know.

47
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,070
Top.

48
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:48,400
My parents will pay a visit around the end of the year.

49
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:50,110
I’d like you to meet them.

50
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:51,610
Of course.

51
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:54,570
I’m sure they will love me.

52
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,130
Cocky much?

53
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,930
I don’t even know if we’re gonna last that long.

54
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:01,840
Hey.

55
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,080
Why would you say that?

56
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,700
Because you’ve never been with anyone for more than three months.

57
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,030
Come on, Mew.

58
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,150
I don’t know what you perceive of me.

59
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,860
But I’m trying to be a better person for you.

60
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:19,400
I quit being a playboy and using drugs for you.

61
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,160
What else do you want me to quit?

62
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:22,340
Tell me.

63
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:24,000
I will do anything.

64
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,730
I surrender.

65
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,650
Something like this takes time.

66
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,850
Words alone aren’t enough.

67
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:34,990
You must show me some actions too.

68
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,320
Got it?

69
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:37,970
Got it, babe.

70
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:50,460
Directed by    Pinya Chookamsri & Tichakorn Phukhaotong

71
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:54,810
This is it, sir.

72
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:57,130
We plan to open it by the beginning of next year.

73
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,150
If things go as planned, there shouldn’t be any problem.

74
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,070
We’d like you to come to the grand opening as well, sir.

75
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,600
Looking good.

76
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:11,290
Amend your business plan and add what I suggested in the file.

77
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:12,570
I think we can consider it done.

78
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,950
But as I warned you before,

79
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,440
you guys are doing more than I asked you to.

80
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:21,280
Sure you can handle it?

81
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,160
We are, sir.

82
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,720
It’s coming up in good shape as we reported.

83
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,680
Even Boston is helping a lot.

84
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,580
Surprised, right, sir?

85
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:34,060
Well, I’m rooting for you all.

86
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,780
But let me remind you this.

87
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:40,880
Even with no business together, friends fight.

88
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:45,510
Now with the business, you guys must take extra caution.

89
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,130
There will be no problem for sure, sir.

90
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:50,940
We keep our personal lives apart from work.

91
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,160
Good then.

92
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,350
This is looking good.

93
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,670
[Hia Song Fishball Noodles]

94
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:04,860
Mew,

95
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,240
your glasses are broken. Aren’t you getting them repaired?

96
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,040
I’m not wearing glasses anymore.

97
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:13,000
I’m getting Lasik.

98
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:16,180
Top is taking me to the doctor he knows.

99
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,800
Top is just great.

100
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:21,970
I want a lover that great too.

101
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:24,190
What the heck, Cheum?

102
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:27,550
Isn’t April taking good care of you?

103
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,210
She is.

104
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,830
But I’m just tired sometimes.

105
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,940
Especially now that she’s discouraged about her short film.

106
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:39,460
I always need to say “You did great, baby. Keep going.”

107
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,630
But you know what? I can’t make any sense out of it.

108
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,590
The film is too indie.

109
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,620
That’s normal.

110
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:47,830
I’m more interested in your story though.

111
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:49,700
What?

112
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,620
I heard from Mew that…

113
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,120
Hey!

114
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,690
You’re dating Nick now.

115
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:57,250
Spill the tea. Are you guys dating?

116
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,290
That’s a total bullshit.

117
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:01,620
Someone like me doesn’t date.

118
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:03,930
Open your heart more, dude.

119
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,470
If the ice in the North Pole can melt,

120
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:10,180
someone can melt your heart too.

121
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:14,840
My heart is kept frozen in a subzero freezer.

122
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:16,580
No one can melt it.

123
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:19,870
How about this?

124
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,600
Invite Nick to Mew’s birthday party at Yo’s club.

125
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:24,860
Why?

126
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:25,980
No way.

127
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,140
You guys are going to abash me in front of him.

128
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,570
You guys are so bad.

129
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:29,420
No, we won’t.

130
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,950
I will behave this time. I promise.

131
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,450
Please.

132
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:33,220
Bring him, Ton.

133
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,720
I will match you two up so nice.

134
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,850
Fine. I’ll ask him.

135
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:39,120
Great. The more the merrier.

136
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:44,610
I think Nick is cute, Ton.

137
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,320
True.

138
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,570
I’m with Mew on that.

139
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:19,740
Can you apply sunscreen for me?

140
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:22,150
You have hands. Do it yourself.

141
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,400
I can’t reach my back.

142
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,650
Fine.

143
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,690
Back against me.

144
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:35,860
All over it.

145
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,110
Don’t give me orders.

146
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:41,430
Hey.

147
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,840
It was freakin’ evil of you for outing Ray that night.

148
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,350
And for recording his video.

149
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:49,490
I know.

150
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:51,840
I was a little high.

151
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,130
Blame it on Sand’s cookies.

152
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:55,920
What?

153
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:01,340
What kind of person are you to blame the cookies?

154
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:03,570
You’re a freakin asshole.

155
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,610
If I was a nice guy, you wouldn’t like me.

156
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,820
I know you have a thing for bad guys.

157
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:18,600
Bad, huh?

158
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,470
Ow!

159
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,180
Bad, huh?

160
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,150
You can’t fight me.

161
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,560
What are you doing? Don’t.

162
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:24,780
Boston.

163
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:31,860
You never replied to my messages.

164
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,330
You expected me to reply?

165
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,400
I said I was sorry.

166
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,980
I didn’t mean to.

167
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:41,240
Not replying to you means I don’t want to see you.

168
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:43,250
How dare you walk in and greet me?

169
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:45,670
I see.

170
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:47,970
I thought we could be friends.

171
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,340
I don’t want to be friends with someone who sneakily recorded me.

172
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,250
Disgusting.

173
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:04,850
Who was that?

174
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:10,450
Remember the story I told you?

175
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,550
Someone recorded my video without my consent.

176
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,300
Yes.

177
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,760
That’s the one.

178
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:19,850
Gap, from Engineer.

179
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,590
I doubt that he really deleted that video.

180
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,860
He probably made a copy.

181
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:28,530
Damn it.

182
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,580
If I wasn't worried about my father's reputation, I'd just let it slide.

183
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,690
You’ve made lots of enemies.

184
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,710
You want to be one of them?

185
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:52,730
Me?

186
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,890
No way!

187
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:00,970
I don’t want to be your enemy.

188
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:02,830
You can’t fight me.

189
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,840
You’re pretty strong.

190
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:07,030
You can’t fight me.

191
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:08,250
Nick!

192
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,580
Don’t let your guard down.

193
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,500
High blood pressure again.

194
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,850
You didn’t get enough sleep, did you?

195
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:17,390
Have you taken the medicines?

196
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,710
The bar closes at 2 a.m.

197
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:22,620
I needed to check everything before going home.

198
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,990
And you dragged me here so early.

199
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,600
What makes you think I had time to sleep, sir?

200
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,540
Hmm?

201
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,450
You take care of me.

202
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:32,110
But don’t forget to take care of yourself.

203
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,960
Live your teenage life.

204
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,490
Be young and wild.

205
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,360
Don’t worry about being wild.

206
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,860
I’ve been wild a long time ago.

207
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:46,470
And that rich friend of yours,

208
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,360
is he your boyfriend?

209
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:52,090
I mean…you mingle with girls and guys.

210
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:53,420
So I’m a little confused.

211
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:54,480
So what is he?

212
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:56,210
That guy?

213
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,940
Not my boyfriend.

214
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,200
We’re just friends.

215
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,840
But we have fun sometimes.

216
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:04,380
Let me warn you, boy.

217
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,330
‘We’re not a thing. We just have fun.’

218
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:11,200
Be careful. It might not be fun anymore one day.

219
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,780
Don’t be nervous, Mew.

220
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,200
There’s nothing to be afraid of.

221
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,470
Getting Lasik is just a blink of an eye.

222
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:35,880
What takes time is the eye examination.

223
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,140
The real process takes like 15 minutes.

224
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:39,900
I know.

225
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:42,490
But I’m worried about the recovery process.

226
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:45,370
Then you got nothing to worry about.

227
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:47,160
It takes just one day to recover.

228
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:51,370
Tomorrow when you wake up, your vision will be crystal clear.

229
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,630
You’ll be fine before your birthday.

230
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:56,910
Thank you so much, Top, for accompanying me.

231
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,710
Of course I’d want to accompany my boyfriend.

232
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,710
Oh, I’m getting coffee downstairs.

233
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:06,650
Do you want anything?

234
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:10,990
An Apple Soda would do.

235
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:12,970
I’ll be right back.

236
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,870
One Pink Milk, please.

237
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:23,080
We’re out of milk. Can you please wait just a moment?

238
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,800
A staff is getting it.

239
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,620
Alright then.

240
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:35,040
Americano with no syrup and one Apple Soda, please.

241
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,150
Of course, sir.

242
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,190
Hi.

243
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,250
What are you doing here?

244
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,340
Oh, I came to the hospital to do laundry.

245
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:53,820
Strong attitude.

246
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:58,410
I just thought I should start a conversation since we couldn’t avoid each other.

247
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,470
I don’t want to have a conversation with someone like you.

248
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:04,590
Come on, Sand.

249
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:08,270
Let bygones be bygones, will you?

250
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,560
How long are you gonna hold the grudge against me?

251
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:12,350
I’m not associating with your ex anymore.

252
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:14,220
We run into each other often these days.

253
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,940
Why don’t we just become friends?

254
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,350
I don’t want to be friends with someone like you.

255
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,930
Mew seems like a nice guy.

256
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:25,470
How unlucky of him to have you as his boyfriend.

257
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:28,650
I get anyone I want.

258
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,340
What about you?

259
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:31,700
Who do you get?

260
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,560
Mew will find out who you really are.

261
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,000
Be prepared.

262
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:40,160
Calm down, pal.

263
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:42,590
People can change.

264
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:45,260
But someone like you can’t.

265
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,740
Once a prick, always a prick.

266
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,940
Iced Americano with no syrup and Apple Soda, sir.

267
00:14:58,930 --> 00:14:59,890
Here you go.

268
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,950
I got mine now.

269
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:07,090
Wish you got yours soon.

270
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:25,540
I get anyone I want.

271
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,550
What about you?

272
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,070
Who do you get?

273
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,160
Mew will find out who you really are.

274
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,610
Be prepared.

275
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:52,080
Nick.

276
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,710
I kept calling you.

277
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:54,780
You didn’t pick up.

278
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:57,140
Sorry, man.

279
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:58,750
I just got back from wakeboard.

280
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,190
You play extreme sports now.

281
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,620
You’ve changed.

282
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,470
Both fashion and lifestyle.

283
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,160
How is it going with you and Boston though?

284
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,990
Are you two still, like, talking?

285
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,360
Well…

286
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:15,700
Damn.

287
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,120
You guys are so sweet. No wonder you forgot about your roommate here.

288
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,120
I get it though.

289
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,240
People in love only hear the sound of their hearts.

290
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,570
Overstatement.

291
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:24,770
And so damn cheesy.

292
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:28,400
Can I borrow your phone, Nick?

293
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,160
I’m calling my mom.

294
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,200
I took her to the hospital and she seemed stressed.

295
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:33,930
Your phone?

296
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:40,920
Whoa!

297
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,480
Holy shit!

298
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,000
Did you go through war?

299
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:47,100
I dropped it while riding my bike.

300
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,790
Do you think you can restore the info?

301
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,500
I’m not sure.

302
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,890
I can if it can be turned on.

303
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:55,380
I’ll take a look. You can leave it in my room.

304
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:58,730
Can you fix it now?

305
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,020
I’m kinda in a hurry.

306
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,400
Must be now?

307
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,740
Now.

308
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:05,930
Fine. I’ll take a look.

309
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:08,030
Let me try connecting it to my computer.

310
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,990
Here.

311
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:35,980
Sand.

312
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:40,880
Sand.

313
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:45,440
Sand.

314
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,220
Hello, Mom.

315
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:47,970
Yes.

316
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:49,220
Don’t forget to take the pills.

317
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,360
And don’t get too stressed out.

318
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,560
Yes.

319
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,350
Thanks, man.

320
00:17:57,970 --> 00:17:58,870
Here.

321
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:01,750
Lucky for you it still works.

322
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,110
Is your mom okay?

323
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:05,880
She is.

324
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,000
She’s just a little anxious.

325
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:08,770
Good then.

326
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:10,820
Thanks a lot.

327
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:11,560
Yeah.

328
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,240
Slowly.

329
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,520
Ouch!

330
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:43,000
This is why I don’t want you to stay here by yourself.

331
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:44,040
So stubborn.

332
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:45,940
Thank you, Top.

333
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,000
Not clearly but I can still see.

334
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,210
I feel bad.

335
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,810
Don’t feel bad.

336
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,480
I’m happy to help.

337
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,290
You want some water or anything?

338
00:18:58,790 --> 00:18:59,630
No.

339
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:06,650
I want you to lie down next to me instead.

340
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:12,420
What?

341
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:14,400
Aren’t you coming?

342
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,450
I’m coming.

343
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,920
But I’m also looking at this needy cat.

344
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:23,400
Come on.

345
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:33,070
Is it because of the medicines you took?

346
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,680
You’re clingier than usual.

347
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:41,810
I guess so.

348
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:44,580
Hey!

349
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,460
Don’t rub your eyes.

350
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:48,400
They can get infected.

351
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,780
I feel scratchy.

352
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:54,950
Can you hold my hands tight?

353
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,780
Don’t let me rub my eyes.

354
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,430
Sure.

355
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,020
Just rest.

356
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:02,720
I will hold your hands until you fall asleep.

357
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:12,850
I can’t believe two people that Boston set up to be a one-night stand can get to this point.

358
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,210
Should I thank him?

359
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,280
I wanted to hit on you anyway after you bumped into me.

360
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,940
Sorry for playing hard to get before we slept together.

361
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,870
I hope it was okay.

362
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,420
It was so okay.

363
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,930
And I'd like to do it with you very often.

364
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,280
Mew.

365
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,760
You came.

366
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:43,240
Yeah. Sorry.

367
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,370
It’s the traffic.

368
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,850
You didn’t respond to my messages all day.

369
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:52,240
Are you mad at me about that night?

370
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,120
Nonsense.

371
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,040
Why would I be mad?

372
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:57,990
Whoever you like is your business.

373
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:02,840
Do you want to play Pool?

374
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,000
You called me out just to play Pool?

375
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:14,900
No.

376
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,210
I actually want to talk to you.

377
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,280
About Mew.

378
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:28,920
What?

379
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:31,730
Are you not okay that I like him?

380
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:34,370
I am okay.

381
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,840
I even get why you like him.

382
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:39,090
He is nice.

383
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,800
People around him can’t help falling for him.

384
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,280
Be clear of what you’re trying to say.

385
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,350
What are you sending me?

386
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:09,450
Play it.

387
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,050
Top and Ton?

388
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:27,310
Yes.

389
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:29,700
I didn’t know who to tell.

390
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,150
So I told you.

391
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:33,850
I’m not that close to Mew.

392
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,060
Where did you get it?

393
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,080
I think you can take a guess.

394
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,430
Who is Boston mingling with right now?

395
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:59,230
I’ve always wanted to warn you.

396
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,020
I know Top.

397
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,250
He stole my lover.

398
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:15,830
I just don’t want a good guy like Mew to get fooled by Top.

399
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:17,850
Mew is lucky though

400
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:21,380
to have you by his side.

401
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:37,380
Ton, you dipshit.

402
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:38,830
Yes?

403
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:40,880
Come take a look.

404
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,300
Do you think my campaign poster looks good enough?

405
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,360
Wow!

406
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,520
A clear policy with a great number.

407
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,800
People will surely vote for you.

408
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:50,420
Alright then.

409
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,640
I hope to get into the parliament this time.

410
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:57,890
Thanks to you, Ton’s friend.

411
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,800
What’s your name again?

412
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,340
I’m Nick, sir.

413
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:03,050
Nick, huh?

414
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:04,740
Thanks for helping.

415
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,530
I could really use young people’s taste.

416
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,600
I need the votes from the youngsters as well.

417
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,340
His policy just fits youngsters’ need.

418
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:14,950
50% off at his massage parlor for the new voters.

419
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:16,710
Ton you piece of crap.

420
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,080
Are you teasing me?

421
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:19,690
Are you?

422
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:21,940
You, though. Can you make it?

423
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:23,400
Will you be able to graduate?

424
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:26,400
A Business Admin student who always takes photos.

425
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,670
I know you don’t give a shit about anything.

426
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:31,140
If you don’t graduate, you go live in New York with your mom.

427
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,680
His mom remarried and now is living in New York.

428
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:37,210
I know he’s thinking about it.

429
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,290
If he fails here, he will just move there.

430
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,020
I’ve never seen your special one by the way.

431
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:44,840
Are you gonna just sleep around?

432
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,120
Huh?

433
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,210
Are you dating anyone now?

434
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:48,360
Why would I want a relationship?

435
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,430
It’s annoying.

436
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,440
Now that’s right.

437
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,740
That’s my son.

438
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,810
Are you proud?

439
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,980
Very much so.

440
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:04,730
You never told me about moving to New York.

441
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:06,880
It’s not settled yet.

442
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,200
I don’t want to jump to that conclusion.

443
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,280
Besides, if I want to do photography,

444
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,600
living in Thailand isn’t gonna help.

445
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:16,460
That’s why you don’t want to get serious with anything here, right?

446
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:18,400
Because you will leave it behind eventually.

447
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:19,560
Yes.

448
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:21,250
The reason I’m not into anyone.

449
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,920
I think it’s a waste of time.

450
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:26,520
I’ll get going now.

451
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:28,360
I’m helping my dad at the shop.

452
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,400
Hey!

453
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:31,110
What’s the matter?

454
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:33,880
Nothing.

455
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,450
Something is totally wrong, you idiot.

456
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,050
Don’t lie.

457
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:40,900
What?

458
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,520
Are you afraid that our happy time is running out?

459
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,510
Don’t be.

460
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:50,430
Before I go, you’re my number one no matter what.

461
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,530
I don’t give a shit about what number I am.

462
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:56,400
Screw it.

463
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,600
I’m not that into you.

464
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:00,500
Are you really not into me?

465
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,590
Ton, stop.

466
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:07,590
Are you really not into me?

467
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:08,780
Ton, enough.

468
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:15,080
I know you like me.

469
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,120
If this was someone else, he’d be ditched already.

470
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,020
Freakin’ annoying.

471
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:23,050
But I still want to see you.

472
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:26,010
Just please don’t be too dramatic.

473
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:28,240
Ton, you son of a bitch.

474
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:29,720
Ray.

475
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,530
What the hell?

476
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:34,600
How could you be so filthy?

477
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:37,120
Will you do filthy shit to all your friends?

478
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,000
What shit are you talking about?

479
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,150
What did I do?

480
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:41,590
You hooked up with Top!

481
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,550
What a douchebag.

482
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:48,540
How did you know that?

483
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:49,260
Who told you?

484
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:52,570
Doesn't matter how I knew it.

485
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:54,040
He’s your friend

486
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,580
Mew is your friend.

487
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:57,820
So?

488
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:01,480
Top and I screwed even before they started dating.

489
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,230
Is it so weird to screw again?

490
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:04,880
I just wanted more.

491
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:07,100
Then I let them love each other all they want.

492
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:09,420
Everyone has a happy ending.

493
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,600
Everyone is filled.

494
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:13,290
You’re selfish.

495
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:15,400
Damn it. He’s your friend.

496
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,950
What did Mew do to you?

497
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:19,510
You know that Mew and Top love each other.

498
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,030
Hear me out, okay?

499
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:24,180
I don’t hate Mew at all.

500
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,610
I was just needy.

501
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,370
The timing was just wrong.

502
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:29,920
Timing, my ass.

503
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,320
The point is your slutty ass just sleeps with anyone.

504
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:36,550
Not just anyone. I picked him.

505
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,260
And how are you involved in this?

506
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,330
Oh!

507
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:50,960
You’re playing a good friend who is always so protective of Mew.

508
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:54,990
Honestly,

509
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:58,070
I think you’re glad that that happened.

510
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:00,710
You’ve always waited for your chance.

511
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:02,710
This is in your favor.

512
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:08,270
You’re waiting for them to break up and be his rebound when he’s weak.

513
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,990
You will get that, man.

514
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:11,330
Ton you motherf*cker!

515
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:12,890
What a scumbag.

516
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:14,430
Say that again.

517
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:21,360
If you tell him, then you’re as evil as me.

518
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:26,400
Don’t act like you mean well while deep down you hope they will break up.

519
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,330
It’s disgusting!

520
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:38,960
You should even thank me big time for getting you out of the friendzone.

521
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:43,860
You asshole!

522
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,930
F*cking jerk.

523
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,030
Damn it!

524
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:11,350
♪ Happy Birthday to you ♪

525
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:16,800
♪ Happy Birthday, Happy Birthday ♪

526
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:22,860
♪ Happy Birthday to you ♪

527
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,600
Thank you, guys.

528
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,590
Make a wish before blowing the candle.

529
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,930
The cake looks expensive.

530
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:39,970
It’s like you’ve been reborn this year, Mew.

531
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:41,850
No more glasses.

532
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:45,430
Who would have thought you’d look this hot?

533
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:49,320
Plug, can Mew be my date for one day?

534
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,190
Yo.

535
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:50,830
What?

536
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:52,020
You can’t date Mew.

537
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,000
He’s all mine.

538
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,710
You guys stink.

539
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:59,130
What do you want this year?

540
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:00,510
Is there anything you want in particular?

541
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:02,010
Nothing in particular.

542
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,900
I just want to graduate with good grades.

543
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,600
My moms are healthy.

544
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,850
And to have good friends like you guys forever.

545
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:10,000
That will make me happy.

546
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,290
Right.

547
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:13,440
No need to wish for a boyfriend this year.

548
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,950
You’ve already got one.

549
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,440
And he’s such a saint.

550
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,880
So good that no God can grant you.

551
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,290
Oh, wait.

552
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:27,350
We must thank God Boston for bringing the top-tier to Mew.

553
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:29,090
Thank God.

554
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:34,350
I’m so happy everyone has a lover.

555
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:38,370
Even a heartless slut like Boston has one.

556
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,220
We’re not boyfriends.

557
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:41,970
Friends.

558
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:43,350
Are you sure?

559
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:46,120
We’re just friends.

560
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,350
Hold on.

561
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:52,030
Not everyone.

562
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:53,390
Ray is available.

563
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:56,810
Right. That’s true.

564
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:59,120
Ray is the stubborn one.

565
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,450
But that’s fine. I’ll find you someone, Ray.

566
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:05,260
Don’t you worry about him, Cheum.

567
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,770
Ray’s got someone in mind.

568
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:10,880
Who?

569
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,380
Guys, why don’t we drink at all?

570
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,600
Come on. Cheers.

571
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,490
Cheers!

572
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,400
Thank you, guys.

573
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,030
Mew.

574
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,840
Your birthday gift.

575
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:31,550
What is this?

576
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,990
Open it.

577
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:34,800
Exclusively for you.

578
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:58,820
Mew.

579
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,760
Are you okay? Do you like it?

580
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,810
I do.

581
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,890
Very much.

582
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:08,820
Thank you so much, Top.

583
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,610
No one has ever made me this.

584
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:13,680
What a surprise.

585
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,900
Being with me is full of surprises.

586
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:20,350
Happy birthday, Mew.

587
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,690
It’s your first birthday we’re together.

588
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,720
I wish we could be together every birthday from now.

589
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:29,720
Aw!! April.

590
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,600
Can you say that on my birthday?

591
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,780
I say that every year.

592
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:36,210
Don’t say it like I’ve never done anything for you.

593
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:37,590
Are you sulking?

594
00:34:37,890 --> 00:34:39,500
Guys. Cheers.

595
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,440
Alright. Let’s drink.

596
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:47,530
Hey, Ray.

597
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,200
Drunk already?

598
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,210
No.

599
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:52,390
Still fine.

600
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,430
Did you sneak in here to get high?

601
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:05,060
Why don’t you love yourself at all, Ray?

602
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,240
I told you to quit using drugs.

603
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,950
You drink and do drugs.

604
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,440
You’re gonna die before you turn 30.

605
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:16,400
Alright.

606
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:17,670
I will quit.

607
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:19,980
Don’t worry about me.

608
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,530
Happy birthday.

609
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,050
Yeah. Thanks.

610
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:34,560
Someone great like you deserves good love.

611
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:40,600
I’m glad to be your friend.

612
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:48,070
Yes.

613
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,190
I’m glad to be your friend as well.

614
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:53,360
Let’s be friends forever.

615
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:55,410
Don’t let anything change that.

616
00:35:58,940 --> 00:35:59,900
Tonight,

617
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:03,660
don’t drive home.

618
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,490
Book a ride or let Boston take you home.

619
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:07,860
I’m worried.

620
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:10,230
Okay.

621
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,630
See you outside.

622
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,620
Mew!

623
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:26,910
I think you look cuter with glasses.

624
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,350
What now?

625
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:32,970
I guess you’re just used to my old look.

626
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,760
I’m always cute with or without glasses.

628
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:49,460

00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:04,560

Excuse me, everyone.

637
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,590
Guys.

638
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,310
What the heck are you doing?

639
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:19,820
Hm?

640
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:20,590
The heck is this?

641
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:22,440
Just hold on.

642
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,640
Let me talk to my friends.

643
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,000
It’s his birthday.

644
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,290
I’d like to say something.

645
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:30,920
Yo.

646
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,480
Can I say a little something here?

647
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:33,390
Go ahead.

648
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,080
Everyone is here.

649
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:43,470
That gives good vibes.

650
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,470
The club is filled with love.

651
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,710
And every one of you came with someone special.

652
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:54,750
Cheum.

653
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,890
You and April have been together since the first year.

654
00:37:58,550 --> 00:37:59,910
You guys have been so in love

655
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,230
and sweet.

656
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:07,100
But you know what, April?
Chem always complains to us you don’t have time for her.

657
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:10,890
You always make short films for contests but never win anything.

658
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:15,440
Besides, she said she didn’t understand your short films.

659
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:17,030
Ray.

660
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:18,320
What the f*ck?

661
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,050
You’re drunk.

662
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,550
I’m not.

663
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:23,070
I’ll give info on every couple here.

664
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:24,720
Hold on.

665
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,310
My dear friend Boston.

666
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,140
So how's it going with you and Nick?

667
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:37,640
Boyfriends?

668
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:41,830
Don’t forget to let me know how fun it is in bed.

669
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:45,190
Just like how you always tell me about other people.

670
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,060
Nick,

671
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,100
have you done it with him in his dark room?

672
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:52,760
You’re not the first.

673
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:55,140
Ray, stop it, you jackass.

674
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,100
No.

675
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,590
Why should I stop?

676
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,130
Why, Sand?

677
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,090
Do you wanna go back to singing that much?

678
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:02,940
You don’t want to be a singer.

679
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:05,080
You just want to make money.

680
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,590
If you want it so much,

681
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:09,510
why don’t you sleep with me?

682
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:19,180
The birthday boy.

683
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:25,260
In my entire life, no one has ever been more loving and caring to me than you.

684
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,220
So I want you to be happy.

685
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,560
Whatever you decide to do,

686
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:34,390
whoever you choose,

687
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,200
I hope it all turns out great.

688
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,570
Choose someone good.

689
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,900
Someone who can make you happy.

690
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:48,940
Though that happiness doesn’t include me, I’m okay.

691
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:52,050
I’ve always been okay, Mew.

692
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,750
As for you, Top.

693
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,460
You’re an asshole!

694
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:05,720
I’ve been taking the best care of my Mew.

695
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:11,380
But you got him now. Why don’t you take good care of him?

696
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:11,990
Ray!

697
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:14,590
Top.

698
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,080
What did I do?

699
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,660
What’s the reason for this stupid whining?

700
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,310
You love Mew.

701
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:22,640
But he doesn’t love you.

702
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,450
You piece of shit.

703
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:24,370
Knock it off.

704
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:24,890
Ray.

705
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:26,590
Please leave.

706
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:27,390
Yo.

707
00:40:28,730 --> 00:40:29,830
Just give me a moment.

708
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,070
You know damn well what shit you did.

709
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:36,170
Motherf*cker!

710
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:36,820
Ray!

711
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:39,720
What the hell is wrong with you, Ray?

712
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:42,170
You’re unlucky in love so you wanna ruin others’ love too?

713
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,100
What you’re doing won’t get Mew to love you.

714
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:45,940
I know.

715
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,330
I know that, Cheum.

716
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:50,750
But no one has said a damn thing.

717
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:51,840
That’s why I need to.

718
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,770
Why are you so quiet, Boston?

719
00:40:57,850 --> 00:40:59,190
Why? You bastard!

720
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:00,480
Damn it!

721
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,600
Don’t stop me, Mew.

722
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,400
Mew.

723
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,580
You’re drunk, Ray.

724
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:05,880
But Top is f*cking crooked.

725
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,400
- Stop being so dumb.
- Mew.

726
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:07,950
Mew.

727
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:10,200
Mew.

728
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:11,440
You guys.

729
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:13,000
I told you to stop.

730
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:13,580
Mew.

731
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:14,540
Stop it.

732
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:28,960
F*ck!!

733
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:46,190
Ray!

734
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:47,420
Stop.

735
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:48,380
What the hell do you want?

736
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:50,280
You’re drunk.

737
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:51,410
I will drive you.

738
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:52,830
I can drive. F*ck off.

739
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:54,280
You can’t.

740
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,170
You can’t even walk steadily.

741
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:58,380
What the f*ck is wrong with you?

742
00:41:58,870 --> 00:41:59,980
Just stop.

743
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:03,290
Stop thinking about Mew and focus on me for once.

744
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:08,720
Can’t you really see that I care about you?

745
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,320
Why would you poke your nose in my business?

746
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:12,070
What are we to each other?

747
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:14,020
What are we?

748
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,390
Right.

749
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:20,150
We’re nothing to each other.

750
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,330
But at least, I’m your fellow human.

751
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:26,360
I don’t want you to drive when drunk.

752
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:28,970
You can risk your life all you want.

753
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:31,790
But don’t you dare risk other people’s lives too.

754
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:33,430
Ray!

755
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:34,960
Let go of me, you shit!

756
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,610
Leave me alone.

757
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,210
Let go!

758
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,070
Or I need to pay you, whore?

759
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:20,620
April.

760
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,530
Can I stay over at your house tonight?

761
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:25,540
I don’t want to go home.

762
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:29,350
That bastard Ray.

763
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:32,360
He absolutely ruined a great night.

764
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:35,630
You should go home.

765
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:37,940
I want my alone time tonight.

766
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:41,260
April.

767
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:45,430
Are you still mad about what Ray said?

768
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:48,490
I’m sorry.

769
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:53,350
I just don’t get it, Cheum.

770
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:55,730
Why did you lie?

771
00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:58,520
Why didn't you say things honestly?

772
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:02,000
My projects suck. You can't make sense out of them.

773
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:05,450
Why didn't you say so?

774
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:11,410
Isn't it a girlfriend's duty to support her girlfriend's dream?

775
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:14,640
By giving me fake compliments?

776
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:18,190
I didn't want to be mean.

777
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:22,980
Can you please do this for me?

778
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:26,850
While we are together, just don't lie.

779
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:29,080
Even about your feelings.

780
00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:33,840
I do care about your words so damn much.

781
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,010
Okay, April.

782
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:39,790
I am sorry.

783
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:42,550
I will not do that again.

784
00:44:43,210 --> 00:44:45,210
Whatever it is, I will tell you directly.

785
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:47,190
I really am sorry.

786
00:45:28,990 --> 00:45:30,870
Where should I put these presents?

787
00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:34,140
Right here is fine.

788
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:24,700
Are you okay, Mew?

789
00:46:29,030 --> 00:46:31,030
I just wonder when Ray will be okay with you.

790
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:33,520
I don't want to choose.

791
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:35,920
Why are you still friends with him?

792
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,920
He's never going to stop liking you.

793
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:40,660
You're right.

794
00:46:41,370 --> 00:46:44,980
When we love or get attached to anyone,

795
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:47,310
it is hard to get over that person. Don’t you think?

796
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:53,120
You are a good friend

797
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:55,870
and a good boyfriend.

798
00:46:56,530 --> 00:46:58,050
No one can get over you easily.

799
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:04,530
I want to repay you.

800
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:06,850
I don't want you to forget about tonight.

801
00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:10,820
It’s the birthday that I feel most special.

802
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,160
Even though Ray ruined your night?

803
00:47:15,470 --> 00:47:16,530
Screw him.

804
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:18,930
I have you by my side.

805
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:20,470
There's nothing to be afraid of.

806
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:27,570
You're just the cutest.

807
00:47:28,570 --> 00:47:33,200
Thank you for making me like this version of myself very much.

808
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:39,200
Can I ask you for one more gift?

809
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:45,240
Mm-hmm.

810
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:46,760
You know what, Top?

811
00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:51,050
I love the sound you make when having sex.

812
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:53,720
What sound?

813
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:03,160
This sound.

814
00:49:18,390 --> 00:49:19,340
What did you send me?

815
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:22,910
I don't expect anything out of this.

816
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,940
I know you will not be okay with this.

817
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:28,130
But I really need to tell you.

818
00:49:29,610 --> 00:49:35,920
Ton and Top slept together before Top met you.

819
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:38,070
And while he's dating you.

820
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:55,590
How did you get it?

821
00:49:57,530 --> 00:49:59,210
It doesn't matter how, Top.

822
00:50:02,830 --> 00:50:04,340
How did you f*cking do that to me?

823
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:08,910
How long ago was it?

824
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:12,250
Mew,

825
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:14,150
it's a long time ago.

826
00:50:14,850 --> 00:50:16,330
Even before I knew you.

827
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Are you saying you didn't do it again after that?

828
00:50:20,410 --> 00:50:22,410
You did not have sex with Boston at all after that?

829
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:23,930
Not at all?

830
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:32,820
You guys f*cked, didn't you?

831
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:35,190
Huh?

832
00:50:35,830 --> 00:50:36,720
Where?

833
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:38,720
When?

834
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:40,880
When was it?

835
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:49,620
The party at the hostel.

836
00:50:58,010 --> 00:50:59,560
The same night you dropped me off here?

837
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:02,360
You said your dad needed you.

838
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:06,350
So you drove back there to hook up with him?

839
00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:14,030
Did you?

840
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:17,510
Yeah?

841
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:21,510
How could you do that to me?

842
00:51:22,450 --> 00:51:23,840
Why did you lie to me?

843
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:29,050
And why did I have to know about this shit the day I've already loved and given you everything?

844
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:32,900
Why did it have to be Boston?

845
00:51:34,630 --> 00:51:35,980
Couldn't it be someone else?

846
00:51:39,030 --> 00:51:39,650
Ah!

847
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:41,220
You guys planned this together?

848
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:45,270
You just wanted to mess with a virgin idiot like me?

849
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:45,770
Mew.

850
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:46,520
Did you have so much fun?

851
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,090
Mew.

852
00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:48,720
It was not that.

853
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:51,880
And then you laughed about me together in bed, right?

854
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:55,950
Did he have fun knowing that I was so inexperienced?

855
00:51:57,130 --> 00:51:59,570
Whatever you wanted, you could’ve just told me.

856
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:00,920
Or I'm just not as sexy as him?

857
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:02,470
What kind of sex do you want? Tell me.

858
00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:03,800
Teach me.

859
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:04,850
Mew.

860
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:06,470
You made that all up in your head.

861
00:52:06,470 --> 00:52:07,380
There's nothing like that.

862
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:08,600
What am I supposed to think

863
00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:11,570
when I cannot trust any word you say?

864
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:29,840
I'm not worthy enough to make you love only me, right?

865
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:51,770
Directed by
Pinya Chookamsri & Tichakorn Phukhaotong

866
00:52:52,450 --> 00:52:55,380
Thanks so much for saving my life.

867
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:56,850
I'm your emergency staff anyway.

868
00:52:56,890 --> 00:52:58,890
I will make you fall in love with me again.

869
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:00,770
Why did you blackmail me?

870
00:53:00,770 --> 00:53:01,860
Calm your shit, man.

871
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:03,360
I didn't do anything.

872
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:05,000
I didn't even record that voice clip.

873
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,690
Can't you just stay with me tonight?

874
00:53:06,690 --> 00:53:08,410
You're more addicted to me than alcohol now.

875
00:53:08,410 --> 00:53:09,280
Ton, that piece of shit.

876
00:53:10,330 --> 00:53:11,370
Honestly.

877
00:53:11,370 --> 00:53:14,950
Without my help, someone like Mew wouldn't be able to get his hands on a top-tier like that.

878
00:53:14,950 --> 00:53:15,640
You bastard.

879
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:16,280
Mew!

880
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:18,280
Mew!
