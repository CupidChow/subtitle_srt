1
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,800
Without you in my life,

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,930
I don't have to worry about who you secretly have sex with.

3
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:10,691
What are you looking at?

4
00:00:10,691 --> 00:00:11,338
Huh?

5
00:00:11,777 --> 00:00:12,413
Hey!

6
00:00:12,857 --> 00:00:14,280
You have Mew. What do you want from me?

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,866
I can have feelings for as many people as I want.

8
00:00:17,866 --> 00:00:19,506
But you can’t do this to me.

9
00:00:19,506 --> 00:00:21,492
What should I do to earn your forgiveness?

10
00:00:21,492 --> 00:00:24,028
Turn around and leave me alone.

11
00:00:24,474 --> 00:00:25,520
Are you using drugs?

12
00:00:25,969 --> 00:00:26,906
Catch him.

13
00:00:26,906 --> 00:00:27,759
Freeze.

14
00:00:27,759 --> 00:00:28,788
You never care about us.

15
00:00:28,788 --> 00:00:29,870
I quit.

16
00:00:37,555 --> 00:00:38,803
Can I crash at your place?

17
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,829
You better not.

18
00:00:40,317 --> 00:00:42,317
Cheum will chew me out.

19
00:00:43,286 --> 00:00:44,814
Don’t tell her then.

20
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:28,360
Hey, Mew.

21
00:01:32,684 --> 00:01:33,714
Where are Cheum and Ray?

22
00:01:34,481 --> 00:01:35,957
Cheum left last night.

23
00:01:36,646 --> 00:01:38,279
Ray is probably drunk and sleeping upstairs.

24
00:01:38,757 --> 00:01:40,000
He had a rough night.

25
00:01:41,026 --> 00:01:42,409
What happened?

26
00:01:42,671 --> 00:01:43,839
I don't remember a thing.

27
00:01:47,292 --> 00:01:50,367
It's good you don't. Last night was a mess.

28
00:01:55,432 --> 00:01:56,574
And why are you here so early?

29
00:01:57,361 --> 00:01:58,455
Why don't you go home?

30
00:01:59,684 --> 00:02:01,317
I've been here since last night.

31
00:02:03,369 --> 00:02:04,740
I was taking care of you.

32
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:13,160
Are you hungry? Do you want anything to eat?

33
00:02:13,201 --> 00:02:15,096
There are some eggs and sausages in the fridge.

34
00:02:16,939 --> 00:02:17,666
No.

35
00:02:18,531 --> 00:02:19,437
I'm going back to my place.

36
00:02:25,736 --> 00:02:26,616
Mew!

37
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:30,800
Mew.

38
00:02:35,767 --> 00:02:36,764
Are you okay?

39
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:39,078
I am.

40
00:02:39,921 --> 00:02:40,981
I probably stood up too fast.

41
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,506
You can’t go on like this, Mew.

42
00:02:43,006 --> 00:02:44,691
You must take good care of yourself now.

43
00:02:45,153 --> 00:02:46,419
Otherwise, everything else will collapse too.

44
00:02:53,693 --> 00:02:54,565
Catch it.

45
00:04:02,624 --> 00:04:06,958
Directed by  Pinya Chookamsri & Tichakorn Phukhaotong

46
00:04:34,192 --> 00:04:35,248
What's the hurry?

47
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,744
Talk to me.

48
00:04:37,628 --> 00:04:38,520
I don't want to.

49
00:04:39,805 --> 00:04:41,920
I don't want to talk to the person who almost put me in jail.

50
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:43,284
Come on.

51
00:04:43,651 --> 00:04:44,606
I'm sorry.

52
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,866
I have no excuses.

53
00:04:51,682 --> 00:04:52,731
Is that all?

54
00:04:53,885 --> 00:04:54,967
I need to go to class.

55
00:04:55,598 --> 00:04:56,523
Hold on.

56
00:04:58,156 --> 00:04:59,640
I still want to clear things up with you.

57
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:02,932
I think I understand more about my feelings.

58
00:05:05,801 --> 00:05:06,528
Oh, yeah?

59
00:05:09,045 --> 00:05:10,056
I'm happy for you.

60
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,508
Do I need to get you a trophy

61
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,765
because you understand more about your feelings?

62
00:05:15,118 --> 00:05:16,331
Stop being sarcastic.

63
00:05:16,601 --> 00:05:17,434
I don't like it.

64
00:05:17,591 --> 00:05:18,942
That's your problem.

65
00:05:20,643 --> 00:05:22,223
Did I ever ask you to like me?

66
00:05:24,622 --> 00:05:25,273
Move.

67
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:31,158
I said move.

68
00:05:34,149 --> 00:05:35,546
Get out of my way!

69
00:05:37,983 --> 00:05:38,730
Go on.

70
00:05:40,513 --> 00:05:42,054
If you hate me so much,

71
00:05:42,054 --> 00:05:43,462
if you don't want to talk to me that much,

72
00:05:44,069 --> 00:05:45,245
why don't you just punch me?

73
00:05:47,815 --> 00:05:49,111
Vent your anger.

74
00:05:50,206 --> 00:05:51,094
Punch me!

75
00:06:05,254 --> 00:06:06,707
Now that you've walked into my life,

76
00:06:07,535 --> 00:06:08,643
I won't let you walk away.

77
00:06:11,763 --> 00:06:12,812
Wanna hit me?

78
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,075
Do it.

79
00:06:49,428 --> 00:06:50,107
Ray.

80
00:06:52,624 --> 00:06:54,233
You're not much better than me.

81
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:27,673
Nice photography skills.

82
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,640
Portraits might seem easy.

83
00:07:32,012 --> 00:07:34,091
But to make them look good is difficult.

84
00:07:34,674 --> 00:07:36,805
It's like you can bring out their inner feelings.

85
00:07:38,359 --> 00:07:40,097
Before photographing these people,

86
00:07:40,801 --> 00:07:42,329
I need to get to know them quite a bit.

87
00:07:42,729 --> 00:07:45,044
That way I can completely bring out their inner feelings.

88
00:07:45,563 --> 00:07:48,822
But I think I still need a lot of practice.

89
00:07:52,881 --> 00:07:54,042
Can you take my photo?

90
00:07:54,521 --> 00:07:55,800
I want to keep it.

91
00:07:56,895 --> 00:07:58,240
Like that guy?

92
00:08:01,361 --> 00:08:01,991
Yes.

93
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:06,560
But I took his photo after we screwed.

94
00:08:07,371 --> 00:08:09,030
That's my way of getting to know people.

95
00:08:16,353 --> 00:08:17,401
How about…

96
00:08:18,353 --> 00:08:21,613
you getting to know me?

97
00:08:24,655 --> 00:08:26,262
Don't you like girls?

98
00:08:32,693 --> 00:08:33,428
I don't know.

99
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:35,453
After talking to you,

100
00:08:37,461 --> 00:08:38,622
I feel like…

101
00:08:39,546 --> 00:08:40,523
I want to try.

102
00:08:41,526 --> 00:08:43,264
But you are my friend's little brother.

103
00:08:48,296 --> 00:08:49,400
I told you.

104
00:08:49,778 --> 00:08:51,490
My sister doesn't need to know about this.

105
00:09:39,169 --> 00:09:40,800
[That night was amazing.]

106
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,264
[Can I come over again?]

107
00:09:57,765 --> 00:09:59,319
Did you fill the bucket with ice?

108
00:09:59,319 --> 00:10:00,084
I did.

109
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,400
Cheers!

110
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,079
Team Second Option!

111
00:10:13,424 --> 00:10:14,349
Hey.

112
00:10:16,781 --> 00:10:18,440
Why can't I forget about Boston

113
00:10:19,129 --> 00:10:20,800
despite the fact that he did lots of shit to me?

114
00:10:21,582 --> 00:10:23,582
Is there any scientific theory

115
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:26,160
that explains why we're attracted to bad people?

116
00:10:26,475 --> 00:10:27,274
Wait.

117
00:10:28,008 --> 00:10:31,529
Maybe I am stimulated by some hormones in my body?

118
00:10:32,415 --> 00:10:34,258
I don't think it's hormones.

119
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:35,796
We are just masochists.

120
00:10:36,392 --> 00:10:38,733
What the heck is ‘masochist’?

121
00:10:39,744 --> 00:10:40,301
Ow!

122
00:10:41,586 --> 00:10:42,086
Ouch.

123
00:10:42,086 --> 00:10:42,800
It hurts.

124
00:10:43,046 --> 00:10:44,400
That's masochism.

125
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:47,001
We just love to be hurt.

126
00:10:47,161 --> 00:10:49,161
The more we get spanked, the more we love it.

127
00:10:49,535 --> 00:10:50,800
And we can't go anywhere.

128
00:10:51,594 --> 00:10:53,279
Damn. Poor us.

129
00:10:57,167 --> 00:10:58,249
Why is that?

130
00:10:59,042 --> 00:11:00,800
I even have someone hitting on me.

131
00:11:02,177 --> 00:11:03,048
Who?

132
00:11:04,177 --> 00:11:05,306
The guy you told me about?

133
00:11:05,306 --> 00:11:07,279
The one that asked you to work with him?

134
00:11:08,094 --> 00:11:09,727
Yes. His name is Dan.

135
00:11:10,801 --> 00:11:12,329
He's texting me right now.

136
00:11:12,624 --> 00:11:13,278
What did he say?

137
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:14,893
Enjoy your trip.

138
00:11:15,124 --> 00:11:17,124
Take me on a trip next time.

139
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,528
Look.

140
00:11:21,004 --> 00:11:21,981
Nick, you idiot.

141
00:11:22,329 --> 00:11:24,460
A decent man is waiting for you.

142
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,751
Isn't it about time to move on?

143
00:11:26,267 --> 00:11:26,983
Yeah.

144
00:11:28,267 --> 00:11:29,446
I think it is now.

145
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:33,416
What about you?

146
00:11:34,176 --> 00:11:35,139
You and Ray.

147
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,928
The way I see it, Ray and Mew will never make it.

148
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:40,771
Trust me.

149
00:11:40,928 --> 00:11:43,760
One day, Ray will crawl back to you.

150
00:11:44,736 --> 00:11:45,687
So?

151
00:11:46,218 --> 00:11:47,960
Are you suggesting that I eat a leftover?

152
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,000
No way.

153
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,240
Look at my face.

154
00:11:50,681 --> 00:11:52,157
I am so handsome that I can choose.

155
00:11:52,268 --> 00:11:52,992
You think?

156
00:11:52,992 --> 00:11:54,268
Look at me. I am so hot.

157
00:11:54,721 --> 00:11:58,840
If you're that hot, you won't be here playing guitar for me.

158
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,974
Damn you. Why do you have to kill my good mood?

159
00:12:00,974 --> 00:12:02,442
Cheers.

160
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,339
Cheers, Yo.

161
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,541
Cheers.

162
00:12:16,452 --> 00:12:22,123
I'd say cheers to the heartbreak but I don't think I can.

163
00:12:22,123 --> 00:12:24,817
As I'm the only one heartbroken.

164
00:12:25,227 --> 00:12:29,115
You have Ray as Top's replacement.

165
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,216
What, Yo?

166
00:12:31,216 --> 00:12:33,400
There's no replacement.

167
00:12:33,851 --> 00:12:35,195
I truly love Ray.

168
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:40,032
I shouldn't overlook someone who has always been by my side. Right?

169
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:42,487
Mew.

170
00:12:43,274 --> 00:12:46,637
Good can't buy love.

171
00:12:46,637 --> 00:12:51,402
If it could, I should've had a hundred husbands by now.

172
00:12:51,402 --> 00:12:53,813
I know so many good people in my life.

173
00:12:53,813 --> 00:12:54,860
Come on.

174
00:12:55,117 --> 00:12:56,514
Don't you teach me.

175
00:12:56,514 --> 00:12:57,852
Did you deal with your stuff?

176
00:12:58,596 --> 00:12:59,652
Did you make it up to him?

177
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:02,550
My turn. I see.

178
00:13:03,108 --> 00:13:05,370
Gosh! I miss him.

179
00:13:06,213 --> 00:13:08,895
Let me buy you more shots.

180
00:13:08,895 --> 00:13:10,518
Wait here.

181
00:13:20,963 --> 00:13:21,832
Hello.

182
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:24,343
Can I have a drink with you?

183
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,739
Of course.

184
00:13:33,951 --> 00:13:36,690
You are a regular here, right?

185
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:38,335
I've seen you quite often.

186
00:13:38,964 --> 00:13:42,328
If you have seen me often then why did you decide to say hi now?

187
00:13:42,701 --> 00:13:45,619
You are cute so I thought that you were already taken.

188
00:13:46,678 --> 00:13:47,329
Yes.

189
00:13:49,007 --> 00:13:49,884
He is.

190
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:04,697
Why are you out partying again? You just fainted the other day.

191
00:14:05,225 --> 00:14:06,178
Why don't you rest?

192
00:14:06,938 --> 00:14:07,959
None of your business.

193
00:14:08,595 --> 00:14:09,782
It's my life.

194
00:14:10,623 --> 00:14:11,553
Stay out of it.

195
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:14,092
I know I can't stop you.

196
00:14:14,939 --> 00:14:15,827
I don't have that right.

197
00:14:16,692 --> 00:14:20,951
But I’m sure you know what you're doing.

198
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,673
Where's Ray anyway?

199
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:28,886
He's coming.

200
00:14:29,725 --> 00:14:30,490
Mew.

201
00:14:32,063 --> 00:14:33,350
Are you really sure?

202
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:34,910
About what?

203
00:14:35,461 --> 00:14:37,354
Are you sure that he loves only you?

204
00:14:39,931 --> 00:14:43,845
Are you trying to discredit other people in order to lessen your own guilt?

205
00:14:46,104 --> 00:14:46,928
Not at all.

206
00:14:48,764 --> 00:14:49,625
I just want you to…

207
00:14:51,137 --> 00:14:52,520
be prepared.

208
00:14:53,117 --> 00:14:54,068
What do you mean?

209
00:14:55,942 --> 00:14:57,470
I just want you to love yourself more.

210
00:14:59,152 --> 00:14:59,928
Mew.

211
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,119
Sorry.

212
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,480
Very bad traffic today.

213
00:15:04,838 --> 00:15:05,615
Sorry.

214
00:15:05,615 --> 00:15:06,314
That's okay.

215
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,090
Thanks for helping me that night.

216
00:15:13,517 --> 00:15:15,400
But my dad could have handled it actually.

217
00:15:15,801 --> 00:15:16,721
You didn't have to butt in.

218
00:15:19,658 --> 00:15:20,581
Sorry.

219
00:15:21,451 --> 00:15:22,403
For something,

220
00:15:23,411 --> 00:15:24,760
I just can't help but butt in.

221
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,238
Can I spend the night here?

222
00:15:57,241 --> 00:15:58,777
I haven't stayed over at your place in a long time.

223
00:15:59,786 --> 00:16:00,735
Since when?

224
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:02,667
The second year, wasn’t it?

225
00:16:03,061 --> 00:16:04,351
On Cheum's birthday.

226
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,316
The night she was so wasted.

227
00:16:07,547 --> 00:16:08,377
I don't remember.

228
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:10,683
But sorry.

229
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:13,333
My moms will stop by tomorrow.

230
00:16:13,918 --> 00:16:14,709
Yeah?

231
00:16:15,497 --> 00:16:16,451
What are they doing in town?

232
00:16:17,522 --> 00:16:18,989
They are buying some stuff for their café.

233
00:16:19,606 --> 00:16:20,672
Should I take you guys shopping?

234
00:16:22,294 --> 00:16:23,019
That's okay.

235
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:24,495
We can take a cab.

236
00:16:24,704 --> 00:16:25,668
Convenient.

237
00:16:34,752 --> 00:16:37,540
Tonight, I want to stay with you.

238
00:16:40,204 --> 00:16:41,045
Mew.

239
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,710
I don't care about what other people think of me.

240
00:16:44,361 --> 00:16:46,639
All I care about is what you think of me.

241
00:16:49,211 --> 00:16:50,041
Ray.

242
00:16:51,084 --> 00:16:54,572
Am I the only person you love right now?

243
00:16:58,374 --> 00:16:59,119
Of course.

244
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:02,668
The word 'love' makes the most sense when used with you.

245
00:17:24,221 --> 00:17:25,363
Stop it, Ray.

246
00:17:29,055 --> 00:17:29,756
Again?

247
00:17:31,055 --> 00:17:31,960
Why, Mew?

248
00:17:33,169 --> 00:17:35,331
Why did you do it with Top but not with me?

249
00:17:38,356 --> 00:17:40,263
So all you want from me is sex?

250
00:17:40,964 --> 00:17:42,547
You just want to defeat Top, right?

251
00:17:42,755 --> 00:17:43,805
No.

252
00:17:44,622 --> 00:17:46,344
But can you just give me the reason?

253
00:17:47,272 --> 00:17:50,060
Why won't you let me have it?

254
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,616
Am I that bad?

255
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:58,072
I've been nothing but good to you for the past four years.

256
00:17:58,254 --> 00:18:00,718
I can't even compare to Top whom you've just known for a few months?

257
00:18:05,492 --> 00:18:06,722
Well, answer me.

258
00:18:12,146 --> 00:18:13,770
You can't, can you?

259
00:18:15,053 --> 00:18:16,079
Let me answer it for you.

260
00:18:18,907 --> 00:18:20,553
Because you are dumb enough to still love Top.

261
00:19:19,207 --> 00:19:20,134
Where are you?

262
00:19:21,207 --> 00:19:22,410
I can't sleep again.

263
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,383
Can you come over?

264
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:27,516
I don't want to take the pills anymore.

265
00:19:45,115 --> 00:19:45,729
Hello.

266
00:19:46,656 --> 00:19:47,996
What took you so long to answer me?

267
00:19:48,172 --> 00:19:49,003
What are you doing?

268
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:50,426
What is it?

269
00:19:51,093 --> 00:19:53,186
Where are you? Are you home? I'm coming over.

270
00:19:53,518 --> 00:19:54,246
No.

271
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,610
Where are you then?

272
00:19:55,975 --> 00:19:57,210
And why do you need to know?

273
00:19:57,656 --> 00:19:59,146
Tell me. I'm coming.

274
00:20:00,102 --> 00:20:01,754
Don't. I don't want to see you.

275
00:20:02,316 --> 00:20:03,482
Don't act silly.

276
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:05,395
Tell me where you are. I'm coming to you.

277
00:20:06,374 --> 00:20:09,116
I'm having a great time. Don't bother me.

278
00:20:09,723 --> 00:20:10,560
Sand!

279
00:20:12,043 --> 00:20:13,438
Did you just hang up on me? Sand?

280
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:26,821
Jackass.

281
00:20:32,811 --> 00:20:33,659
Who was that?

282
00:20:34,285 --> 00:20:35,437
Your haunting spirit?

283
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:36,851
Hell yeah.

284
00:20:37,106 --> 00:20:38,490
He's probably drunk again.

285
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:40,421
He kept rambling that he's coming.

286
00:20:41,043 --> 00:20:42,881
Does even know where you are?

287
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:45,028
I don't know. I didn't tell him where.

288
00:20:45,288 --> 00:20:47,775
Even if I did, he wouldn't come.

289
00:20:48,866 --> 00:20:50,217
I'm not that important.

290
00:20:50,686 --> 00:20:54,169
And even though he's coming, he has to travel on mountain roads for like two hours.

291
00:20:55,336 --> 00:20:56,182
Come on, man.

292
00:20:56,553 --> 00:20:58,147
Don't underestimate the power of love.

293
00:20:58,319 --> 00:20:59,970
It can drive people to do anything.

294
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:03,971
But for Ray, I don't think it's the power of love.

295
00:21:04,659 --> 00:21:05,876
It's the power of lust.

296
00:21:10,141 --> 00:21:11,156
Let’s drink.

297
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:49,685
Atom,

298
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:52,227
what are you doing here so late?

299
00:21:54,309 --> 00:21:55,730
Can I come inside?

300
00:21:56,686 --> 00:21:57,991
I'm working.

301
00:21:58,506 --> 00:21:59,579
Say what you need to say.

302
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:02,767
Why don't you reply to my messages?

303
00:22:03,769 --> 00:22:05,792
I've been swamped with work.

304
00:22:06,047 --> 00:22:07,530
Just get to your business.

305
00:22:08,122 --> 00:22:09,241
Can I come inside?

306
00:22:09,241 --> 00:22:10,403
No! I'm afraid you can't.

307
00:22:10,557 --> 00:22:11,295
Just go home.

308
00:22:11,295 --> 00:22:12,140
You're drunk, Atom.

309
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:12,835
Leave.

310
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:17,947
What the hell?

311
00:22:20,126 --> 00:22:21,546
Did I just get nailed and bailed?

312
00:22:21,765 --> 00:22:22,977
What the hell are you talking about?

313
00:22:23,354 --> 00:22:25,570
You wanted to try. I just responded to your request.

314
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:26,691
So that you know what you are.

315
00:22:26,691 --> 00:22:29,595
Gay, straight, pan, whatever the f*ck you want to be.

316
00:22:30,066 --> 00:22:31,695
I just opened your eyes.

317
00:22:33,844 --> 00:22:35,612
So I just got my first lesson from you, didn’t I?

318
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:37,410
Thanks.

319
00:22:37,902 --> 00:22:41,810
But what you did was f*cking awful.

320
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:43,588
What the f*ck!

321
00:22:43,588 --> 00:22:44,210
Hey!

322
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:46,168
I care about you.

323
00:22:46,168 --> 00:22:48,143
And who asked you to?

324
00:22:48,643 --> 00:22:50,481
It's just a one-night stand situation.

325
00:22:51,298 --> 00:22:52,556
Don't be dramatic.

326
00:22:52,794 --> 00:22:54,794
Don't expect love from me.

327
00:22:55,283 --> 00:22:56,541
You and I compete in different leagues.

328
00:23:10,442 --> 00:23:13,025
My favorite movie from Pixar is Inside Out.

329
00:23:13,025 --> 00:23:13,856
Do you know it?

330
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:15,022
For real?

331
00:23:15,254 --> 00:23:16,631
I like Inside Out too.

332
00:23:16,631 --> 00:23:17,272
Really?

333
00:23:17,272 --> 00:23:19,783
Yes. What's that imaginary elephant's name again?

334
00:23:19,783 --> 00:23:20,564
Bing Bong.

335
00:23:20,564 --> 00:23:22,231
Yes, Bing Bong.

336
00:23:22,231 --> 00:23:24,979
That scene when he disappeared, I just couldn't hold back my tears.

337
00:23:25,632 --> 00:23:26,730
You cried?

338
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:27,410
I did.

339
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:29,810
Didn't you have friends as a kid? You just talked to yourself?

340
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:31,637
Yes, I loved talking to my imaginary friend. Do you have a problem?

341
00:23:31,637 --> 00:23:32,137
Huh?

342
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:33,152
How?

343
00:23:33,152 --> 00:23:34,225
Hello.

344
00:23:34,225 --> 00:23:37,534
Can you play with me? I'm so lonely. I have no friends.

345
00:23:37,891 --> 00:23:39,080
Can you buy me a toy?

346
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,021
You weren't lonely. You were just a lunatic.

347
00:23:41,021 --> 00:23:41,736
Yeah?

348
00:23:48,001 --> 00:23:48,783
Sand.

349
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,410
Why don't we hook up?

350
00:23:53,259 --> 00:23:54,254
What now?

351
00:23:54,393 --> 00:23:55,421
Are you drunk?

352
00:23:56,024 --> 00:23:57,792
No. You're my roommate.

353
00:23:58,563 --> 00:23:59,401
I'm serious.

354
00:24:00,699 --> 00:24:02,510
We are two people with the same fate.

355
00:24:03,095 --> 00:24:04,956
We love people who don't love us back.

356
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:07,770
We are super decent people.

357
00:24:07,941 --> 00:24:09,385
Why do we need to wait for those assholes?

358
00:24:10,271 --> 00:24:12,850
I can actually picture myself with you.

359
00:24:13,575 --> 00:24:15,482
It's not bad at all.

360
00:24:15,952 --> 00:24:17,141
What are you talking about?

361
00:24:17,348 --> 00:24:19,464
Loneliness is like opposite poles that attract, huh?

362
00:24:20,518 --> 00:24:21,521
I'm serious here.

363
00:24:32,026 --> 00:24:34,930
We might have just overlooked each other this whole time.

364
00:25:03,009 --> 00:25:03,966
Holy shit!

365
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:07,410
I just can't.

366
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:08,081
Right.

367
00:25:08,081 --> 00:25:10,081
Kissing you gives me nothing.

368
00:25:10,081 --> 00:25:11,087
Me neither.

369
00:25:11,297 --> 00:25:13,297
Nothing sparked at all.

370
00:25:13,783 --> 00:25:14,779
This is embarrassing.

371
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:16,339
The idea was so lame.

372
00:25:16,771 --> 00:25:17,711
Are you okay?

373
00:25:17,711 --> 00:25:18,377
I am.

374
00:25:18,377 --> 00:25:20,167
Don't worry about it. It's funny. We're still friends.

375
00:25:20,589 --> 00:25:22,265
Come on. Let's go to bed.

376
00:25:22,265 --> 00:25:23,787
Friends can hug each other to sleep.

377
00:25:23,787 --> 00:25:25,324
Just don't hook up. That's going to be complicated.

378
00:25:36,841 --> 00:25:38,447
What the hell did we just do?

379
00:25:47,521 --> 00:25:48,492
Here it is.

380
00:25:50,583 --> 00:25:51,357
Thank you.

381
00:26:02,981 --> 00:26:03,653
Hey!

382
00:26:03,653 --> 00:26:04,657
What are you guys doing?

383
00:26:05,126 --> 00:26:05,863
Are you hooking up?

384
00:26:07,717 --> 00:26:08,980
Ray! Why are you here?

385
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,890
I told you I'd come. I'm keeping my promise.

386
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:14,073
But it's 2 in the morning. Did you drive here all by yourself?

387
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:14,970
Damn right, I did.

388
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:17,730
If I hadn't, I wouldn't have seen you guys hooking up.

389
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:20,276
Hey, we're not hooking up.

390
00:26:20,466 --> 00:26:22,035
We're just cuddling.

391
00:26:22,035 --> 00:26:22,930
Stop talking.

392
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:25,842
Hooking up or not isn't Ray's business.

393
00:26:26,413 --> 00:26:28,413
But we really didn't do it.

394
00:26:28,413 --> 00:26:29,556
Forget it, Nick.

395
00:26:30,458 --> 00:26:32,458
I don't mind if you two did it.

396
00:26:32,551 --> 00:26:33,879
But can I sleep here tonight?

397
00:26:35,026 --> 00:26:35,758
Can I?

398
00:26:38,169 --> 00:26:39,692
What the heck are you doing, Ray?

399
00:26:40,951 --> 00:26:42,580
I want to sleep with you guys.

400
00:26:43,745 --> 00:26:45,815
Or we can have a threesome. I don't mind.

401
00:26:47,043 --> 00:26:47,944
Just get out.

402
00:26:47,944 --> 00:26:49,043
No.

403
00:26:49,729 --> 00:26:50,268
Come on.

404
00:26:50,778 --> 00:26:52,540
I drove all the way here.

405
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,237
Get out.

406
00:26:53,951 --> 00:26:55,881
Let me sleep here.

407
00:26:58,217 --> 00:26:59,058
Scoot over.

408
00:27:11,323 --> 00:27:13,323
How did you know I was here?

409
00:27:13,753 --> 00:27:15,753
Nick checked in on his Story.

410
00:27:16,914 --> 00:27:17,733
Right, Nick?

411
00:27:19,795 --> 00:27:20,605
(Sorry.)

412
00:27:21,967 --> 00:27:23,156
Just go to sleep.

413
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,370
Good night, Nick.

414
00:27:27,598 --> 00:27:28,469
Good night.

415
00:27:40,377 --> 00:27:41,186
Mew.

416
00:27:41,186 --> 00:27:41,970
Mew.

417
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:42,715
Wake up.

418
00:27:43,392 --> 00:27:44,283
Are you alright?

419
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:47,326
Mom.

420
00:27:47,851 --> 00:27:49,851
When did you arrive? Why didn't you call?

421
00:27:51,071 --> 00:27:52,613
We knocked on your door a hundred times.

422
00:27:52,613 --> 00:27:54,410
We called you a hundred times. You didn't pick up.

423
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:57,944
We were so worried that we asked for the spare key and barged in.

424
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:00,537
I'm so sorry.

425
00:28:01,552 --> 00:28:04,527
I dozed off and slept in.

426
00:28:09,069 --> 00:28:09,964
Is this yours?

427
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:13,868
When did you smoke?

428
00:28:15,458 --> 00:28:16,771
Just recently.

429
00:28:17,431 --> 00:28:18,922
But I’m not addicted to it.

430
00:28:19,633 --> 00:28:20,920
Can you quit?

431
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,963
For me, please.

432
00:28:24,672 --> 00:28:27,232
Mew, are you going through any problems right now?

433
00:28:28,489 --> 00:28:30,107
If there's anything at all, you can tell us.

434
00:28:30,996 --> 00:28:32,360
I think you've changed.

435
00:28:32,842 --> 00:28:35,453
You look tired and skinnier.

436
00:28:37,478 --> 00:28:38,689
It's nothing.

437
00:28:39,411 --> 00:28:41,411
I was just stressed about my graduation project.

438
00:28:42,402 --> 00:28:43,534
I’m doing better now.

439
00:28:43,534 --> 00:28:44,733
Don’t worry.

440
00:28:45,698 --> 00:28:46,858
But I think…

441
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:47,494
Let's go.

442
00:28:48,282 --> 00:28:50,995
I'm going to go take a shower. Then we will head out.

443
00:28:52,988 --> 00:28:53,801
Alright.

444
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:56,312
Be careful.

445
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:11,089
No one accepts our booking.

446
00:29:11,851 --> 00:29:13,291
Let's go check out a cab out front.

447
00:29:13,646 --> 00:29:14,832
I'm not sure there's any though.

448
00:29:15,251 --> 00:29:16,818
I told you to learn how to drive.

449
00:29:16,818 --> 00:29:17,970
It's convenient for you.

450
00:29:19,554 --> 00:29:21,554
I am afraid of big trucks. You know that.

451
00:29:21,983 --> 00:29:24,772
Trucks? Are you kidding me?

452
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,076
Come on.

453
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:28,687
Mew.

454
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:32,827
Hello ma'am.

455
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:33,741
Hello.

456
00:29:34,182 --> 00:29:35,978
I'm Top, Mew's friend.

457
00:29:36,333 --> 00:29:37,690
Ah, Top.

458
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:39,450
I saw you on Mew's Instagram.

459
00:29:40,018 --> 00:29:42,425
You look better in person.

460
00:29:42,425 --> 00:29:43,442
Thank you, ma'am.

461
00:29:45,165 --> 00:29:46,158
Why are you here?

462
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,547
What's your business?

463
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,291
I've got something important to talk to you.

464
00:29:50,291 --> 00:29:51,368
I didn't get a chance to say it the other day.

465
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:53,253
You should have called first.

466
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:55,351
We are headed for shopping.

467
00:29:55,351 --> 00:29:56,092
Not available.

468
00:29:56,434 --> 00:29:57,491
I did call.

469
00:29:57,618 --> 00:29:58,561
You didn't answer.

470
00:30:00,026 --> 00:30:01,492
Are you guys going shopping?

471
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:03,977
Yes, we are getting decoration stuff for our café.

472
00:30:04,964 --> 00:30:08,593
If you don't mind, I can take you.

473
00:30:09,998 --> 00:30:11,016
No need.

474
00:30:11,016 --> 00:30:12,151
We can manage.

475
00:30:12,646 --> 00:30:14,010
Lots of taxis around here.

476
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:16,468
You just said it's hard to get one.

477
00:30:16,823 --> 00:30:19,765
It's quite windy and looks like it's about to rain.

478
00:30:19,765 --> 00:30:20,923
Let's don't.

479
00:30:20,923 --> 00:30:22,878
Your friend offered his help. We should take it.

480
00:30:23,838 --> 00:30:25,930
Are you sure this is okay with you, Top?

481
00:30:26,628 --> 00:30:27,752
It's totally okay, ma'am.

482
00:30:27,752 --> 00:30:29,544
I'm free all day.

483
00:30:29,671 --> 00:30:31,347
Mew's mothers are like my own.

484
00:31:09,082 --> 00:31:10,369
[I headed back to town.]

485
00:31:10,648 --> 00:31:12,393
[I didn't want to interrupt your love.]

486
00:31:13,028 --> 00:31:15,384
[Don't waste the romantic scenery.]

487
00:31:38,006 --> 00:31:39,650
So Nick went back because of me?

488
00:31:40,437 --> 00:31:41,623
Glad you realized that.

489
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:45,545
I am thick-skinned.

490
00:31:46,843 --> 00:31:47,952
I don't care.

491
00:31:48,814 --> 00:31:50,290
Tell me, Ray.

492
00:31:52,518 --> 00:31:54,085
Doesn't Mew you know about us?

493
00:31:55,407 --> 00:31:56,336
He does.

494
00:31:57,023 --> 00:31:58,094
Just not the whole story.

495
00:31:59,048 --> 00:32:00,157
What did he say?

496
00:32:01,148 --> 00:32:03,148
He doesn't know we're still sleeping together.

497
00:32:03,789 --> 00:32:05,789
So I'm your secret lover.

498
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:08,386
I feel bad for Mew.

499
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:10,930
He was fooled by Top.

500
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:12,073
And he's fooled by you.

501
00:32:14,171 --> 00:32:15,713
How about we stop this?

502
00:32:16,577 --> 00:32:17,941
Come on, Sand.

503
00:32:19,059 --> 00:32:20,346
You're not my secret lover.

504
00:32:20,981 --> 00:32:22,879
You're an important person to me too.

505
00:32:24,583 --> 00:32:25,692
Don't think too much.

506
00:32:26,505 --> 00:32:28,200
Can you stop saying things like that?

507
00:32:29,292 --> 00:32:32,463
I'm not just stuff you have in your possession.

508
00:32:32,959 --> 00:32:34,137
I have feelings.

509
00:32:34,959 --> 00:32:36,290
Treat me nicer.

510
00:32:40,636 --> 00:32:41,427
Screw it.

511
00:32:43,489 --> 00:32:44,953
I'll just be honest here.

512
00:32:45,898 --> 00:32:46,879
I admit it.

513
00:32:48,024 --> 00:32:49,043
I like you.

514
00:32:50,695 --> 00:32:52,330
And I like you so much.

515
00:32:52,668 --> 00:32:56,093
I'm jealous of you and Mew but I can't do anything, can I?

516
00:32:56,721 --> 00:33:01,088
I'm saying this not because I want you to break up with Mew or anything.

517
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:03,044
I just don't want to be anyone's option.

518
00:33:04,722 --> 00:33:06,315
And don't you feel pity for me.

519
00:33:07,917 --> 00:33:10,146
I can deal with my own feelings.

520
00:33:15,507 --> 00:33:17,100
Thanks for being honest.

521
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,610
I like you too.

522
00:33:20,955 --> 00:33:22,955
But Mew is important to me.

523
00:33:23,641 --> 00:33:25,437
It's not easy for me to get over him.

524
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:27,997
It's up to you.

525
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:29,854
I won't put pressure on you.

526
00:33:30,495 --> 00:33:34,684
But if I find someone with no conditions, I'm ready to go.

527
00:33:34,837 --> 00:33:35,692
I will not wait for you.

528
00:33:39,137 --> 00:33:39,966
Come on.

529
00:34:10,827 --> 00:34:11,601
Hey.

530
00:34:13,077 --> 00:34:14,608
You're free to go now.

531
00:34:14,608 --> 00:34:15,327
You don't have to wait.

532
00:34:15,623 --> 00:34:16,809
We will call a cab home.

533
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:20,155
It's all fine. There aren't many cabs here.

534
00:34:20,383 --> 00:34:21,672
And you're doing a big shopping.

535
00:34:22,028 --> 00:34:23,019
Let me help.

536
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:25,307
Say what you want.

537
00:34:25,815 --> 00:34:27,092
You want to talk about Ray, right?

538
00:34:27,321 --> 00:34:28,120
What is it?

539
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:30,050
And how does it concern you?

540
00:34:30,243 --> 00:34:31,861
I just want you to know

541
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:36,822
that the person you think loves you the most it's not that good.

542
00:34:40,818 --> 00:34:41,701
But I'll just leave it there.

543
00:34:42,261 --> 00:34:45,516
I don't want to use a dirty way to get you back.

544
00:34:46,705 --> 00:34:48,247
I will let you handle it.

545
00:34:49,451 --> 00:34:50,512
I'll just stand aside.

546
00:34:52,039 --> 00:34:52,825
Mew.

547
00:34:54,411 --> 00:34:57,734
Whatever happens, whatever status you give me,

548
00:34:59,206 --> 00:35:00,493
please know that I always care for you.

549
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:06,055
If this Mew, the partygoer, is who you want to be,

550
00:35:07,369 --> 00:35:08,334
then I'm happy for you.

551
00:35:09,047 --> 00:35:13,060
But if not, I'd love to have the old Mew back.

552
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:23,780
This would be all.

553
00:35:24,798 --> 00:35:25,737
Yes, please.

554
00:35:26,373 --> 00:35:27,154
How much?

555
00:35:29,091 --> 00:35:29,946
Let's go.

556
00:35:30,706 --> 00:35:32,375
Ma'am, let me give you a hand.

557
00:35:32,871 --> 00:35:33,853
Thank you.

558
00:35:33,853 --> 00:35:34,500
No problem.

559
00:35:35,786 --> 00:35:38,117
So did you get everything you need?

560
00:35:38,366 --> 00:35:39,271
We did.

561
00:35:39,271 --> 00:35:40,468
Actually more than we need.

562
00:35:40,468 --> 00:35:42,007
A lot more.

563
00:35:42,007 --> 00:35:43,717
Thanks for helping us today.

564
00:35:44,651 --> 00:35:46,651
Since you already lent us a hand,

565
00:35:46,651 --> 00:35:48,506
if you have time before Christmas,

566
00:35:48,506 --> 00:35:53,490
you can come over to our café and see the decorations.

567
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:55,121
We need opinions from youngsters.

568
00:35:55,518 --> 00:35:56,449
Mom.

569
00:35:56,982 --> 00:35:58,371
I can help you with that.

570
00:35:58,573 --> 00:35:59,708
Don't bother him.

571
00:36:00,571 --> 00:36:01,574
You don't bother me at all.

572
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:03,097
I would love to come to visit.

573
00:36:03,097 --> 00:36:04,510
I want to see your café.

574
00:36:04,917 --> 00:36:06,917
I'm sure it's cozy and warm just like you guys are.

575
00:36:07,424 --> 00:36:08,247
You're a sweet talker.

576
00:36:08,247 --> 00:36:09,890
You know your way around adults.

577
00:36:11,215 --> 00:36:13,215
Please take care of Mew.

578
00:36:13,799 --> 00:36:15,952
He's getting skinnier and skinnier.

579
00:36:16,077 --> 00:36:17,770
Eat more, you know?

580
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:21,093
Finish the food I brought for you, alright?

581
00:36:21,093 --> 00:36:23,026
And don't forget to share some with Top.

582
00:36:23,169 --> 00:36:24,584
He's crazy rich.

583
00:36:25,346 --> 00:36:27,193
He can find himself food. We don't need to give it to him.

584
00:36:27,876 --> 00:36:31,250
Well, it's our own recipe. It's not like he can get it anywhere.

585
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:34,081
The snacks I brought are straight from our café.

586
00:36:34,081 --> 00:36:35,371
I made them myself.

587
00:36:35,371 --> 00:36:36,819
They’re so good.

588
00:36:36,983 --> 00:36:38,061
How fortunate.

589
00:36:38,061 --> 00:36:39,410
I'd love to try them.

590
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:41,760
Then you should pay us a visit.

591
00:36:43,388 --> 00:36:44,981
How can I say no to that invitation?

592
00:36:45,179 --> 00:36:48,095
If Mew doesn't mind, I will be there for sure.

593
00:36:48,405 --> 00:36:50,150
Even if he does, you can still go.

594
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:52,135
We are inviting you.

595
00:36:52,349 --> 00:36:53,512
Mew doesn't get a say in this.

596
00:36:54,021 --> 00:36:54,858
Mom.

597
00:36:56,701 --> 00:36:57,725
Let's get going now.

598
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:02,264
Can you help take a look?

599
00:37:02,264 --> 00:37:03,338
Of course.

600
00:37:13,783 --> 00:37:15,427
I haven't been in this kind of place in a long time.

601
00:37:15,427 --> 00:37:16,529
I feel so old.

602
00:37:17,354 --> 00:37:19,609
Come on. It's all about our mindset.

603
00:37:20,178 --> 00:37:22,930
If you think you're old, you will feel old.

604
00:37:23,281 --> 00:37:25,610
But if you want to be old that bad,

605
00:37:25,802 --> 00:37:28,413
I'm going to call you Daddy.

606
00:37:29,905 --> 00:37:31,192
Daddy?

607
00:37:31,192 --> 00:37:32,498
Like a father?

608
00:37:32,498 --> 00:37:33,790
I am not even 40 yet.

609
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:35,126
No, it's not that.

610
00:37:35,126 --> 00:37:37,384
Daddy in this case doesn't mean father.

611
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:40,658
It means someone aged but still hot.

612
00:37:42,632 --> 00:37:43,541
Up to you then.

613
00:37:43,541 --> 00:37:44,759
Call me whatever you like.

614
00:37:45,206 --> 00:37:47,206
Anyways, thanks for taking me out.

615
00:37:47,535 --> 00:37:50,019
It's good to be carefree once in a while.

616
00:37:52,598 --> 00:37:53,485
What?

617
00:37:53,663 --> 00:37:54,776
Let's dance.

618
00:37:58,182 --> 00:37:59,143
Well then…

619
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:02,345
I'm not going to be your boss tonight.

620
00:38:03,042 --> 00:38:06,162
Call me Daddy Dan.

621
00:38:08,212 --> 00:38:09,041
Okay, sir.

622
00:39:04,357 --> 00:39:05,336
I'm going to…

623
00:39:05,438 --> 00:39:06,459
use the restroom.

624
00:39:08,643 --> 00:39:09,623
I'll be waiting right here.

625
00:39:11,048 --> 00:39:11,941
I'll be right back.

626
00:39:35,207 --> 00:39:36,520
Someone is in here.

627
00:39:46,875 --> 00:39:48,056
You followed me?

628
00:39:48,311 --> 00:39:49,995
I'm going to call the cop on you.

629
00:39:50,758 --> 00:39:51,836
I didn't follow you.

630
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,802
I just saw you by chance.

631
00:39:54,303 --> 00:39:56,252
You knocked on my restroom door. What do you want?

632
00:39:58,210 --> 00:39:59,981
I just want to talk to you for the last time.

633
00:40:03,186 --> 00:40:04,410
I just want to say that

634
00:40:06,533 --> 00:40:08,533
I'm really sorry about everything that happened.

635
00:40:10,898 --> 00:40:12,542
You don't have to forgive me.

636
00:40:14,958 --> 00:40:17,619
I just want you to know that

637
00:40:19,411 --> 00:40:23,890
being with you made me so happy.

638
00:40:25,278 --> 00:40:26,443
To me,

639
00:40:27,817 --> 00:40:29,161
you're a man with talent.

640
00:40:30,164 --> 00:40:33,335
One day, you will become a famous photographer.

641
00:40:35,053 --> 00:40:36,243
Just like you want.

642
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:40,056
And you're not a bad guy.

643
00:40:41,912 --> 00:40:45,770
Your friends love you for who you are.

644
00:40:47,086 --> 00:40:50,010
You don't have to change.

645
00:40:53,795 --> 00:40:54,904
Because I…

646
00:40:57,931 --> 00:40:59,931
love you for who you are as well.

647
00:41:06,139 --> 00:41:07,681
You're not going to see me again.

648
00:41:10,861 --> 00:41:12,861
I'm showing up in front of you for the last time.

649
00:41:18,026 --> 00:41:18,957
Goodbye, Ton.

650
00:41:34,451 --> 00:41:35,637
Your ex?

651
00:41:36,246 --> 00:41:37,533
He's so dramatic.

652
00:41:39,553 --> 00:41:40,494
I'm leaving.

653
00:41:41,181 --> 00:41:41,935
Hey.

654
00:41:57,749 --> 00:41:58,619
You know what?

655
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,311
The night I crashed my car,

656
00:42:00,844 --> 00:42:02,656
I thought I was going to die.

657
00:42:04,384 --> 00:42:06,267
I saw the pictures of myself as a baby,

658
00:42:06,881 --> 00:42:08,037
of my mom dying,

659
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:09,995
of myself laughing with friends,

660
00:42:10,562 --> 00:42:11,770
of myself being happy,

661
00:42:12,309 --> 00:42:14,286
of the last person I talked to.

662
00:42:16,494 --> 00:42:17,329
It was you.

663
00:42:20,471 --> 00:42:21,378
You know what?

664
00:42:22,037 --> 00:42:23,568
If something happened to you that night,

665
00:42:24,182 --> 00:42:25,737
I would never forgive myself for the rest of my life.

666
00:42:27,992 --> 00:42:28,890
So what?

667
00:42:29,739 --> 00:42:31,927
You were the one that saved my life after all.

668
00:42:35,481 --> 00:42:40,576
How many people do you think would cry for me if I actually died?

669
00:42:41,404 --> 00:42:42,912
Would they be sad?

670
00:42:43,338 --> 00:42:47,260
Or would they be happy to lose a shitty guy like me?

671
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:50,801
That's an overstatement.

672
00:42:51,157 --> 00:42:53,673
There are lots of shittier people than you in this world.

673
00:42:53,841 --> 00:42:57,623
Compared to Boston, you're a saint.

674
00:43:02,165 --> 00:43:06,017
But if something actually happened to you,

675
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:10,059
at least I would be crying for you.

676
00:43:16,376 --> 00:43:18,022
If that day comes,

677
00:43:19,335 --> 00:43:21,349
can you sing Micro songs at my funeral?

678
00:43:22,123 --> 00:43:23,050
I like this one.

679
00:43:23,569 --> 00:43:25,569
♪ I better not ♪

680
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:28,155
♪ Just forget it ♪

681
00:43:28,603 --> 00:43:30,275
♪ I should forget it ♪

682
00:43:30,275 --> 00:43:30,775
You jackass.

683
00:43:30,775 --> 00:43:31,752
No. Stop it.

684
00:43:31,901 --> 00:43:33,385
Stop talking about death.

685
00:43:33,385 --> 00:43:36,288
I have dreams. I don't want to die just yet.

686
00:43:37,092 --> 00:43:37,997
Okay.

687
00:43:38,911 --> 00:43:44,039
Now that I live, can I join you on the music festival trips around the world?

688
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:46,300
Follow your dream.

689
00:43:49,635 --> 00:43:50,458
Sure you can.

690
00:43:52,568 --> 00:43:54,284
But it's rough and tough.

691
00:43:54,998 --> 00:43:57,561
Are you sure your prince ass can handle it?

692
00:43:59,427 --> 00:44:00,234
I am.

693
00:44:02,485 --> 00:44:04,027
I can go anywhere as long as I have you.

694
00:44:07,602 --> 00:44:08,451
Tell you what.

695
00:44:09,834 --> 00:44:13,188
All my life, I've never been this yielding to anyone.

696
00:44:14,105 --> 00:44:16,770
I've never been so crazy for anyone that I drove all the way here either.

697
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:22,095
Hey.

698
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:24,224
My social service is almost over.

699
00:45:25,457 --> 00:45:26,918
Thanks for keeping me company.

700
00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:28,876
It’s alright.

701
00:45:29,607 --> 00:45:31,888
Don't forget to consult with a therapist about quitting drinking.

702
00:45:33,770 --> 00:45:34,390
Um.

703
00:45:37,907 --> 00:45:38,748
Ray.

704
00:45:39,971 --> 00:45:41,408
Where did you go that night?

705
00:45:41,882 --> 00:45:42,939
You didn’t pick up the phone.

706
00:45:43,783 --> 00:45:44,843
I was worried.

707
00:45:48,803 --> 00:45:49,818
I went to see a friend.

708
00:45:54,598 --> 00:45:55,780
A friend named Sand?

709
00:46:01,782 --> 00:46:02,530
Um.

710
00:46:03,493 --> 00:46:04,669
Did Top tell you that?

711
00:46:06,545 --> 00:46:07,275
Top?

712
00:46:09,618 --> 00:46:10,915
He knows about this?

713
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,171
I just took a guess based on your behavior.

714
00:46:18,907 --> 00:46:20,110
Yo knows it.

715
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:21,044
Everybody does.

716
00:46:21,492 --> 00:46:22,463
Why didn’t you tell me?

717
00:46:26,894 --> 00:46:27,923
I don’t know.

718
00:46:28,946 --> 00:46:30,477
I just didn’t want to lose you.

719
00:46:33,764 --> 00:46:38,062
What you’re doing isn’t different from what Top did to me.

720
00:46:51,103 --> 00:46:55,049
I’m glad you picked Sand though.

721
00:46:59,958 --> 00:47:01,114
Aren’t you mad?

722
00:47:03,674 --> 00:47:05,205
I don’t have the right to be.

723
00:47:06,030 --> 00:47:07,467
You’re the one that should be mad.

724
00:47:09,324 --> 00:47:15,005
You can clearly see I dated you just to hurt Top.

725
00:47:21,691 --> 00:47:22,463
Yeah.

726
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:25,168
I kind of took the hint.

727
00:47:26,042 --> 00:47:27,479
But I was trying to fool myself.

728
00:47:28,797 --> 00:47:32,579
I was telling myself that you might truly love me.

729
00:47:34,844 --> 00:47:36,867
But it’s clear you still love Top.

730
00:47:41,437 --> 00:47:43,718
I’m dumb just like you called me.

731
00:47:44,712 --> 00:47:45,504
Hey.

732
00:47:46,770 --> 00:47:47,579
I’m sorry.

733
00:47:47,991 --> 00:47:49,428
I didn’t mean to call you that.

734
00:47:55,693 --> 00:47:57,318
But are you really giving him a second chance?

735
00:47:59,503 --> 00:48:00,395
Um.

736
00:48:01,309 --> 00:48:02,464
I want to try.

737
00:48:03,675 --> 00:48:05,112
I can see his effort.

738
00:48:09,829 --> 00:48:10,844
It’s your call.

739
00:48:11,998 --> 00:48:15,570
But if he does some shit to you again, I’ll put him in the hospital.

740
00:48:17,531 --> 00:48:18,406
Watch me.

741
00:48:19,465 --> 00:48:21,770
You should worry about yourself.

742
00:48:22,396 --> 00:48:24,396
You found someone you like.

743
00:48:24,706 --> 00:48:28,230
If he loves you too, do your best to keep him.

744
00:48:28,769 --> 00:48:30,417
Reduce your ego.

745
00:48:31,219 --> 00:48:33,266
No one can put up with everything you do.

746
00:48:39,331 --> 00:48:40,273
Thanks.

747
00:48:41,770 --> 00:48:42,476
Yeah.

748
00:48:44,007 --> 00:48:44,738
I love you.

749
00:48:48,771 --> 00:48:49,759
I love you, too.

750
00:49:00,942 --> 00:49:02,661
Lucky for us we didn’t hook up.

751
00:49:03,367 --> 00:49:05,015
Otherwise, we wouldn’t be able to look each other in the eye.

752
00:49:07,271 --> 00:49:09,570
You just missed the best life experience.

753
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:12,722
Such a bragger.

754
00:49:12,722 --> 00:49:13,898
I’m telling the truth.

755
00:49:21,597 --> 00:49:22,847
I came to apologize.

756
00:49:23,297 --> 00:49:25,203
Sorry about my f*cked-up behavior recently.

757
00:49:26,216 --> 00:49:28,216
The evil spirit left you already, huh?

758
00:49:28,854 --> 00:49:29,719
Cheum

759
00:49:30,610 --> 00:49:31,956
I wasn't possessed by a ghost.

760
00:49:33,071 --> 00:49:34,508
I was just lost.

761
00:49:35,568 --> 00:49:40,592
I want you to understand that what happened to me affected my self-confidence so much.

762
00:49:42,627 --> 00:49:44,627
I just thought if I became someone else,

763
00:49:45,593 --> 00:49:46,930
I'd be stronger.

764
00:49:47,410 --> 00:49:48,190
And how did that turn out?

765
00:49:48,565 --> 00:49:51,890
Is Mew who 'can't come to the phone right now' still there?

766
00:49:51,890 --> 00:49:52,548
Huh?

767
00:49:56,152 --> 00:49:56,966
Cheum.

768
00:49:57,107 --> 00:49:57,801
Hm?

769
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:02,130
Do you still want to run the hostel with us?

770
00:50:03,319 --> 00:50:06,374
If you guys promise you will stop this mess,

771
00:50:06,877 --> 00:50:08,291
I will come back to work with you again.

772
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:17,472
Cheum.

773
00:50:17,791 --> 00:50:18,536
Hm?

774
00:50:19,091 --> 00:50:20,770
I think I still love Top.

775
00:50:21,004 --> 00:50:21,770
Oh, please.

776
00:50:22,230 --> 00:50:25,730
Is there anything on this Earth that is more obvious?

777
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:28,930
And Top, too, still loves you so much.

778
00:50:28,930 --> 00:50:34,930
I saw him taking care of you so well and never left your side on Halloween night.

779
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:38,892
But what he did was damn evil.

780
00:50:39,386 --> 00:50:41,386
It's too much to forgive. I understand that.

781
00:50:41,658 --> 00:50:43,025
Whatever.

782
00:50:43,569 --> 00:50:44,889
I'm not rooting for him anymore.

783
00:50:45,211 --> 00:50:48,454
I just want you to follow your heart.

784
00:50:48,962 --> 00:50:50,730
Don't just listen to your vengeful self.

785
00:50:50,730 --> 00:50:51,692
Hi Dad.

786
00:50:51,921 --> 00:50:53,405
Hey, where have you been?

787
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:55,645
With a friend.

788
00:50:56,610 --> 00:50:57,508
Hello, Mew.

789
00:50:59,435 --> 00:51:01,294
Come down here and help out later.

790
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:06,720
What's the matter with Atom?

791
00:51:07,611 --> 00:51:08,973
He just broke up with his girlfriend.

792
00:51:08,973 --> 00:51:10,330
Probably hurt.

793
00:51:10,501 --> 00:51:12,595
Don't mind him. He will get a new girlfriend soon.

794
00:51:15,384 --> 00:51:16,962
Is being a lesbian easier?

795
00:51:17,975 --> 00:51:20,842
Life is tough whatever the hell you are.

796
00:51:20,842 --> 00:51:22,164
It depends on that individual.

797
00:51:22,882 --> 00:51:24,530
Eat already.

798
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:25,578
The noodles are all mushy now.

799
00:51:26,570 --> 00:51:27,411
Fine.

800
00:51:32,104 --> 00:51:33,264
Please hold.

801
00:51:35,163 --> 00:51:36,003
Thank you.

802
00:51:36,888 --> 00:51:37,878
Which floor?

803
00:51:38,347 --> 00:51:39,005
Uh…

804
00:51:40,284 --> 00:51:41,155
I see.

805
00:51:42,468 --> 00:51:43,597
We're going to the same floor, right?

806
00:52:16,778 --> 00:52:17,522
Are you alright?

807
00:52:18,226 --> 00:52:19,529
Do you need a hand?

808
00:52:20,011 --> 00:52:21,542
I'm all good. Thank you so much.

809
00:52:26,062 --> 00:52:27,144
Really, I'm fine.

810
00:52:27,378 --> 00:52:28,765
My room is just right here.

811
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:31,595
My room is right here as well.

812
00:52:47,047 --> 00:52:49,633
You have the key card. Why don't you use it?

813
00:53:05,792 --> 00:53:07,792
Directed by
Pinya Chookamsri & Tichakorn Phukhaotong

814
00:53:08,266 --> 00:53:09,690
Are you giving me a second chance?

815
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:11,060
Giving you a chance?

816
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:12,755
You’re still having your ex over.

817
00:53:12,755 --> 00:53:14,249
Before we start over,

818
00:53:14,249 --> 00:53:15,994
I want you to vent it all out, Mew.

819
00:53:15,994 --> 00:53:16,678
What about Boeing?

820
00:53:16,678 --> 00:53:18,421
Why does everyone hate me?

821
00:53:18,421 --> 00:53:20,614
Why can’t I stop doing shit to people?

822
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:23,571
Maybe you just want to be loved.

823
00:53:23,571 --> 00:53:24,717
I missed you.

824
00:53:24,717 --> 00:53:26,182
I got you the information.

825
00:53:26,182 --> 00:53:28,345
The rehabs in and out of Bangkok.

826
00:53:28,345 --> 00:53:30,433
I can go if you want me to.

827
00:53:30,433 --> 00:53:31,666
On one condition.

828
00:53:31,666 --> 00:53:34,009
Will you go to your dad and tell him you’re his son?

829
00:53:34,009 --> 00:53:34,731
Excuse me.
