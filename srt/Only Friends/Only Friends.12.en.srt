1
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,840
I'm moving out after graduation.

2
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:09,160
You can move in with me.

3
00:00:09,527 --> 00:00:10,903
Move in with me, Mew.

4
00:00:10,903 --> 00:00:13,046
I just want to spend more time with you.

5
00:00:13,925 --> 00:00:16,019
You know that I'm going to live in New York, right?

6
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:17,650
It's the reason you don't want to get into a serious relationship.

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,073
But you might be my exception.

8
00:00:23,135 --> 00:00:25,541
I know you're with someone new.

9
00:00:26,497 --> 00:00:28,747
But I want to know if I still have a chance.

10
00:00:29,417 --> 00:00:30,575
What are you guys doing?

11
00:00:30,868 --> 00:00:32,440
How about we go to my place?

12
00:00:57,332 --> 00:00:58,989
Why are you still drinking, Ray?

13
00:00:59,721 --> 00:01:01,160
Your rehab session isn’t over yet.

14
00:01:02,981 --> 00:01:04,076
It’s fine.

15
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,495
I’m drinking just a little.

16
00:01:05,975 --> 00:01:07,476
And I’m at my house.

17
00:01:10,264 --> 00:01:12,440
You’re a perfect boyfriend as always.

18
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,522
Never fail to look after your boyfriend.

19
00:01:17,721 --> 00:01:18,468
Ray.

20
00:01:19,404 --> 00:01:20,875
You’re so lucky.

21
00:01:22,552 --> 00:01:27,235
You won't find anybody as caring as Sand anywhere.

22
00:01:28,468 --> 00:01:30,156
If he’s that good,

23
00:01:32,539 --> 00:01:34,258
then why did you dump him for Top?

24
00:01:36,698 --> 00:01:37,731
Because I was dumb.

25
00:01:39,186 --> 00:01:44,399
People only recognize the value of something after they lose it.

26
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:49,549
Do you still love him?

27
00:01:50,797 --> 00:01:51,698
Hm?

28
00:01:53,457 --> 00:01:56,018
I think we should talk about something else.

29
00:01:56,748 --> 00:01:59,372
Let bygones be bygones.

30
00:01:59,521 --> 00:02:00,492
Come on, Sand.

31
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,409
Let’s hear Boeing’s answer first.

32
00:02:06,852 --> 00:02:07,756
Of course, I do.

33
00:02:08,852 --> 00:02:10,042
I love him every day.

34
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:13,380
Even when I was with Top.

35
00:02:16,418 --> 00:02:17,326
What about you?

36
00:02:17,962 --> 00:02:18,933
Do you still love him?

37
00:02:26,649 --> 00:02:27,828
What shit are you playing?

38
00:02:27,828 --> 00:02:28,649
I’m out.

39
00:02:32,264 --> 00:02:33,703
Answer my question.

40
00:02:34,137 --> 00:02:35,388
Do you still love him?

41
00:02:37,085 --> 00:02:40,239
If you don't know, why don’t you kiss him to find out?

42
00:02:40,921 --> 00:02:42,266
You might get the answer from that.

43
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,772
You still love him.

44
00:03:16,755 --> 00:03:18,131
Do you love me too?

45
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,165
There's a way out

46
00:03:47,188 --> 00:03:48,467
to this kind of problem.

47
00:04:06,276 --> 00:04:07,840
I'm out of here.

48
00:04:09,601 --> 00:04:11,164
Whatever shit you want to do, just go ahead.

49
00:04:11,987 --> 00:04:13,082
Why leaving so soon?

50
00:04:14,061 --> 00:04:15,147
I'm still having fun.

51
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:17,122
You are.

52
00:04:17,568 --> 00:04:18,851
But I'm not.

53
00:04:32,043 --> 00:04:32,873
Sand.

54
00:04:35,368 --> 00:04:36,507
What's wrong?

55
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:41,029
Are you seriously asking me what's wrong?

56
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,794
What the hell are you doing?

57
00:04:42,794 --> 00:04:43,758
What am I doing?

58
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,920
You still love him

59
00:04:46,188 --> 00:04:47,315
so I dragged him here for you.

60
00:04:48,013 --> 00:04:49,514
But I wanted to join just a little.

61
00:04:49,921 --> 00:04:50,834
Don't you like that?

62
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,040
No, I don't.

63
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,153
This is not what I want.

64
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,870
What is it that you want then?

65
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,080
You two love each other.

66
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,365
Are you getting back together?

67
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:03,791
If you are, let me know.

68
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:05,290
Don't be silly.

69
00:05:06,121 --> 00:05:07,840
I'm not thinking that far.

70
00:05:08,913 --> 00:05:10,383
How am I silly, Sand?

71
00:05:10,987 --> 00:05:15,607
I heard you two talking in the bar about the dream you shared.

72
00:05:15,825 --> 00:05:17,326
Attend concerts around the world.

73
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,837
Now what?

74
00:05:20,274 --> 00:05:21,615
He's back to you.

75
00:05:21,926 --> 00:05:22,959
Do you guys want to go together?

76
00:05:24,394 --> 00:05:25,988
He's just my ex.

77
00:05:26,906 --> 00:05:28,532
Everyone has their past.

78
00:05:28,864 --> 00:05:30,614
You also liked Mew.

79
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:32,611
Now you tell me.

80
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,358
Do you still love him?

81
00:05:36,106 --> 00:05:37,302
I used to like Mew.

82
00:05:38,581 --> 00:05:39,385
Yes.

83
00:05:39,987 --> 00:05:41,051
I love him, even.

84
00:05:41,534 --> 00:05:43,035
But I love him as a friend.

85
00:05:43,681 --> 00:05:44,870
But yours,

86
00:05:45,281 --> 00:05:46,439
what kind of love is it?

87
00:05:51,695 --> 00:05:53,165
You don't have to answer me, Sand.

88
00:05:54,351 --> 00:05:59,346
The second I saw you guys kiss, I knew I was just a second string.

89
00:06:01,074 --> 00:06:02,700
I'm going to be fair here.

90
00:06:05,535 --> 00:06:07,972
I don't like him being around you like this.

91
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:10,077
He comes to see you at the bar.

92
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,520
He acts sad.

93
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:13,721
Anyone can tell he wants you back.

94
00:06:14,768 --> 00:06:18,390
If you're choosing him, kindly let me know.

95
00:06:19,306 --> 00:06:20,464
But if you're choosing me,

96
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,720
deal with him and get it over with.

97
00:06:25,894 --> 00:06:27,270
Or I'll do it myself.

98
00:07:48,914 --> 00:07:49,864
Guys.

99
00:07:51,736 --> 00:07:53,120
Should I move in with him?

100
00:07:55,003 --> 00:07:56,504
I think it's a good idea.

101
00:07:56,504 --> 00:07:57,996
You guys just got back together.

102
00:07:57,996 --> 00:08:00,235
Living together can help strengthen your love.

103
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:01,760
But I don't think it is.

104
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:05,116
If you move in with him, you rely on him for everything.

105
00:08:05,116 --> 00:08:06,979
Whatever you do, you will need to consider him too.

106
00:08:06,979 --> 00:08:08,363
That can be uncomfortable, Mew.

107
00:08:09,003 --> 00:08:09,921
It's not gonna work.

108
00:08:10,202 --> 00:08:11,284
Ray.

109
00:08:13,167 --> 00:08:15,417
Are you worried about me or you just hate him?

110
00:08:18,281 --> 00:08:19,376
Come on, Ray.

111
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:23,240
As long as you're my friend, you can't avoid him.

112
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,895
Are you two going to fight every time you see each other?

113
00:08:25,895 --> 00:08:29,761
I just don't think someone like him is capable of change.

114
00:08:33,172 --> 00:08:34,120
I don't know.

115
00:08:35,761 --> 00:08:37,636
I don't know if he will be a jerk again.

116
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:41,720
But I gave him the chance because I love him.

117
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,624
If he cheats on me again,

118
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:47,416
I won't stop you if you want to run him over with your car.

119
00:08:48,426 --> 00:08:50,080
Do you think this will work, Mew?

120
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,768
Ray is with Sand,

121
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:53,950
whose ex-boyfriend got stolen by Top.

122
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:57,516
And if Top wants to be one of us, he must apologize to Sand.

123
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,273
Right.

124
00:08:59,273 --> 00:09:00,311
Can he?

125
00:09:00,542 --> 00:09:05,287
If you can put Top and Sand on good terms, I'll accept Top as your boyfriend.

126
00:09:05,721 --> 00:09:07,160
But that might not be necessary.

127
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,640
Sand is probably getting back together with his ex Boeing.

128
00:09:12,243 --> 00:09:13,014
Hold on.

129
00:09:13,357 --> 00:09:15,054
Boeing is Sand's ex?

130
00:09:15,663 --> 00:09:16,741
Heck yeah.

131
00:09:16,741 --> 00:09:17,533
Why?

132
00:09:21,231 --> 00:09:23,075
He just messed with me and Top.

133
00:09:27,983 --> 00:09:28,954
Do tell.

134
00:09:32,507 --> 00:09:34,507
What a small world.

135
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:36,078
I have a headache.

136
00:09:36,078 --> 00:09:37,948
Real life is more dramatic than dramas.

137
00:09:37,948 --> 00:09:38,875
True.

138
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:45,959
What are you doing here?

139
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,879
I came to see the professor.

140
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:50,104
To resign.

141
00:09:52,849 --> 00:09:54,067
Why?

142
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:55,697
You're about to graduate.

143
00:09:56,738 --> 00:09:58,208
I don't want to do the thesis.

144
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,750
Besides, I don't like the graduation ceremony.

145
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:01,655
It's hot.

146
00:10:02,374 --> 00:10:06,589
It's alright. I can put your name back on our project.

147
00:10:06,589 --> 00:10:07,589
Cheum.

148
00:10:08,766 --> 00:10:10,236
Did you ask us yet?

149
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,200
I knew the truth from Atom.

150
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:21,411
No hard feelings anymore.

151
00:10:22,951 --> 00:10:25,294
I’m sorry I slapped you.

152
00:10:27,345 --> 00:10:28,283
It’s alright.

153
00:10:28,751 --> 00:10:29,813
It didn’t hurt.

154
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,371
I’m sorry too for sleeping with your brother.

155
00:10:33,912 --> 00:10:35,538
But about the project, don’t do that.

156
00:10:35,538 --> 00:10:36,385
I’m serious.

157
00:10:37,546 --> 00:10:39,546
I don’t want the graduation certificate anyway.

158
00:10:44,299 --> 00:10:47,297
What I want is a chance to be your friend again.

159
00:11:10,451 --> 00:11:11,424
Boo!

160
00:11:14,637 --> 00:11:15,726
What are you doing?

161
00:11:17,591 --> 00:11:18,562
This?

162
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,400
I'm drafting a home plan for the renovation.

163
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,218
I want this place to have one corner just for you.

164
00:11:23,218 --> 00:11:25,789
This will be a built-in bookshelf.

165
00:11:25,841 --> 00:11:28,558
In the middle, there will be the kitchen

166
00:11:28,558 --> 00:11:30,709
- so that I can cook for you…
- Top.

167
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,764
I haven’t agreed to move in yet.

168
00:11:34,837 --> 00:11:37,400
We can put the renovation on hold for now.

169
00:11:37,871 --> 00:11:38,546
Hey.

170
00:11:39,107 --> 00:11:40,089
Why?

171
00:11:40,257 --> 00:11:42,520
You always sleep over.

172
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:45,160
Don’t be afraid I’ll annoy you.

173
00:11:45,341 --> 00:11:51,833
If you’re tired of seeing my face one day, I’ll go hide.

174
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:54,440
Don’t you want to move in with me?

175
00:11:54,764 --> 00:11:55,953
How sad.

176
00:11:55,953 --> 00:11:56,896
Oh, please.

177
00:11:56,896 --> 00:11:59,220
It’s not that, Top.

178
00:11:59,220 --> 00:11:59,963
Come here.

179
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:02,779
Listen.

180
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:05,720
I want to move in with you.

181
00:12:06,613 --> 00:12:08,084
But I feel bad.

182
00:12:08,415 --> 00:12:11,382
You take care of me and pay a lot for me,

183
00:12:12,327 --> 00:12:14,560
I feel like a sugar baby somehow.

184
00:12:16,648 --> 00:12:18,336
Why would you think that?

185
00:12:18,473 --> 00:12:21,240
This hotel will be mine eventually.

186
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,378
My dad will let me take on the business.

187
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:24,840
I’m the only child.

188
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:28,015
That's how comfortable your life is while dating me.

189
00:12:28,975 --> 00:12:29,977
No.

190
00:12:30,878 --> 00:12:32,285
I want to earn things myself.

191
00:12:33,358 --> 00:12:35,358
I will work at the hostel.

192
00:12:35,565 --> 00:12:37,565
Open a small café.

193
00:12:38,187 --> 00:12:41,960
I might not be rich soon but it should make me happy.

194
00:12:42,175 --> 00:12:43,146
Okay.

195
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:44,815
I will not sugar-daddy you then.

196
00:12:45,116 --> 00:12:46,600
We will build our lives together instead.

197
00:12:46,785 --> 00:12:49,253
I’m not gonna inherit from my dad anymore.

198
00:12:49,253 --> 00:12:53,360
I will live my own life and run my own renovation and interior design company.

199
00:12:53,721 --> 00:12:56,120
I can design the café for you.

200
00:12:56,513 --> 00:12:57,671
Hold on one second.

201
00:12:58,681 --> 00:13:00,837
How about you reconsider the inheritance?

202
00:13:01,492 --> 00:13:02,962
What if you need it one day?

203
00:13:05,239 --> 00:13:07,426
Look, Mew.

204
00:13:08,518 --> 00:13:09,894
Please move in.

205
00:13:10,343 --> 00:13:13,840
I know you’re the one I want to see every day.

206
00:13:14,004 --> 00:13:16,877
I want to lie down next to you and talk about our future every night.

207
00:13:17,287 --> 00:13:20,036
From now on, there’ll be just us.

208
00:13:21,143 --> 00:13:22,769
No one else will get in between.

209
00:13:23,384 --> 00:13:25,010
Um…

210
00:13:31,536 --> 00:13:33,536
Um…

211
00:13:51,082 --> 00:13:51,865
Fine.

212
00:13:53,094 --> 00:13:54,033
Really?

213
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:55,094
Yes.

214
00:13:58,334 --> 00:13:59,720
You’re the cutest.

215
00:14:00,098 --> 00:14:01,256
But…

216
00:14:01,767 --> 00:14:04,141
you must clean up your old mess first.

217
00:14:04,141 --> 00:14:04,986
Okay?

218
00:14:05,142 --> 00:14:08,140
Come on. What’s left to clean?

219
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,254
I’ve cleaned up everything in the past.

220
00:14:10,294 --> 00:14:12,294
Boeing leaves us alone now.

221
00:14:12,294 --> 00:14:13,708
Ton is gone.

222
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:14,919
What’s left to do?

223
00:14:15,571 --> 00:14:16,822
What about Sand?

224
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:18,991
Hm?

225
00:14:21,674 --> 00:14:22,582
Right.

226
00:14:23,436 --> 00:14:26,621
I admit I was an asshole back then.

227
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:29,720
But what do you want me to do?

228
00:14:32,066 --> 00:14:33,161
I think

229
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:37,053
maybe he just wants an apology from you.

230
00:14:39,275 --> 00:14:40,901
Please, Top.

231
00:14:41,318 --> 00:14:42,460
Please.

232
00:14:43,521 --> 00:14:44,597
Can you do it?

233
00:14:45,795 --> 00:14:47,171
How about I give you the reward first?

234
00:14:52,261 --> 00:14:53,232
Yeah!

235
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,221
Here. Let me tie it for you.

236
00:15:11,922 --> 00:15:14,172
You know I'm not good at rollerblading.

237
00:15:14,172 --> 00:15:15,419
Why did you ask me here?

238
00:15:15,858 --> 00:15:17,720
I like it. It's cool.

239
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,528
Vintage sport.

240
00:15:19,384 --> 00:15:20,680
I'm not very good at it myself.

241
00:15:21,677 --> 00:15:24,925
You're tying my shoes like we're boyfriends.

242
00:15:25,969 --> 00:15:28,040
You may have only seen my other parts,

243
00:15:28,418 --> 00:15:30,044
not my sweet part.

244
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:34,707
I'm telling you, my pampering and caring skills are just as good as my skills in bed.

245
00:15:35,543 --> 00:15:37,543
Are you always confident about everything?

246
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:42,269
Wasn't it my confidence that pulled you back to me?

247
00:15:43,204 --> 00:15:43,993
Huh?

248
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:47,912
Yeah.

249
00:15:48,629 --> 00:15:49,758
You win.

250
00:15:52,413 --> 00:15:53,315
Come on.

251
00:15:53,315 --> 00:15:54,413
Let’s try to stand up.

252
00:16:01,853 --> 00:16:03,096
Take my hand.

253
00:16:10,863 --> 00:16:11,720
See?

254
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:14,106
You can do it. It's not that hard.

255
00:16:14,361 --> 00:16:15,488
Not that hard, my ass.

256
00:16:15,488 --> 00:16:16,778
I'm about to fall.

257
00:16:16,778 --> 00:16:18,236
Don't be afraid.

258
00:16:18,464 --> 00:16:19,684
I'll save you.

259
00:16:24,503 --> 00:16:25,400
Let's go.

260
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,323
You're doing great.

261
00:16:27,009 --> 00:16:28,080
Good.

262
00:16:28,443 --> 00:16:30,131
Hey, Ton!

263
00:16:30,131 --> 00:16:31,812
Ton. Ton.

264
00:16:31,812 --> 00:16:33,089
Fine. No pranking. Come here.

265
00:16:34,309 --> 00:16:35,498
Don't be afraid.

266
00:16:35,498 --> 00:16:36,424
I feel like I'm falling.

267
00:16:36,424 --> 00:16:38,120
I got you.

268
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,682
Don't let go.

269
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:41,467
You got it.

270
00:16:42,047 --> 00:16:44,764
It’s too fast.

271
00:16:44,764 --> 00:16:46,117
Yes, you're doing that.

272
00:17:04,264 --> 00:17:04,961
Tired?

273
00:17:04,961 --> 00:17:06,046
Heck, yes.

274
00:17:06,046 --> 00:17:07,960
You let me rollerblade alone.

275
00:17:08,197 --> 00:17:10,478
Well, I was scared.

276
00:17:19,973 --> 00:17:20,944
Hey.

277
00:17:21,673 --> 00:17:23,860
What's your plan for New York?

278
00:17:24,371 --> 00:17:27,525
I might take photography classes and keep taking pictures to practice.

279
00:17:28,243 --> 00:17:29,120
That's good.

280
00:17:29,413 --> 00:17:30,571
You've got skills.

281
00:17:30,926 --> 00:17:32,926
You already wasted too much time on something you're not really into.

282
00:17:34,966 --> 00:17:36,280
What could I have done?

283
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:39,799
Everyone needs time to figure out what their heart desires.

284
00:17:41,721 --> 00:17:42,473
Right.

285
00:17:43,632 --> 00:17:45,882
You should have asked me to be your boyfriend sooner.

286
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:47,176
Why?

287
00:17:47,176 --> 00:17:49,384
I want to see more of your cheesy side.

288
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:52,920
How about, during the time we have left,

289
00:17:53,129 --> 00:17:55,722
I'm gonna be so sweet that you need to check for high blood sugar?

290
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,460
Don't you believe me?

291
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,815
Still don't.

292
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:05,154
Okay. I do now.

293
00:18:05,154 --> 00:18:06,070
I do.

294
00:18:10,369 --> 00:18:14,480
What if I moved to New York with you?

295
00:18:15,489 --> 00:18:17,480
I could do animation there.

296
00:18:17,801 --> 00:18:18,848
Who knows?

297
00:18:19,503 --> 00:18:21,236
I might get to work at Pixar one day.

298
00:18:22,699 --> 00:18:25,760
Are you going there for yourself or for me as my boyfriend?

299
00:18:28,653 --> 00:18:29,651
For myself.

300
00:18:30,653 --> 00:18:32,466
But you are the bonus.

301
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:34,786
It's your call.

302
00:18:36,451 --> 00:18:37,952
But I don't think you should follow me there.

303
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:41,720
I'm not the type to plan far ahead.

304
00:18:42,378 --> 00:18:43,785
I think today, I do it tomorrow.

305
00:18:44,052 --> 00:18:45,397
You can't keep up with me.

306
00:18:46,844 --> 00:18:48,563
Just enjoy what's now.

307
00:18:49,542 --> 00:18:54,318
And the time we have left, I'll be a good boyfriend for you.

308
00:19:08,853 --> 00:19:13,960
Today, Mr. Rabbit will show you how to clean your nose, little creatures.

309
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,384
Does anyone here know how to do it?

310
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:18,588
Yes?

311
00:19:18,588 --> 00:19:20,650
Where is Mr. Big Bug?

312
00:19:21,915 --> 00:19:22,878
Ah.

313
00:19:23,533 --> 00:19:24,726
Mr. Big Bug?

314
00:19:25,186 --> 00:19:26,406
He didn’t come today.

315
00:19:26,577 --> 00:19:31,120
But without Mr. Big Bug, we can still have fun.

316
00:19:31,255 --> 00:19:33,880
But I want Mr. Big Bug to teach us.

317
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,640
Yes.

318
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,726
Right.

319
00:19:37,726 --> 00:19:41,270
We want Mr. Big Bug.

320
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:43,594
Please. He didn’t come today.

321
00:19:45,327 --> 00:19:47,171
Mr. Big Bug is here.

322
00:19:48,868 --> 00:19:50,119
Mr. Big Bug is here, guys.

323
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:55,474
Yeah!

324
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,754
Before I teach you all nasal washes,

325
00:19:58,754 --> 00:20:01,242
I’d like to teach you how to apologize first.

326
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:03,839
Because when there’s a fight, no one in both parties is happy.

327
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:04,781
Right?

328
00:20:05,447 --> 00:20:07,160
Right.

329
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:10,142
So if you’re having a fight with your friend, you should apologize.

330
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:15,086
I’m sorry.

331
00:20:15,227 --> 00:20:16,666
Wonderful.

332
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,270
As for me, Mr. Big Bug,

333
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:21,594
I’m so sorry, Mr. Rabbit,

334
00:20:21,594 --> 00:20:23,824
for upsetting you.

335
00:20:23,824 --> 00:20:25,328
I’m sorry.

336
00:20:27,315 --> 00:20:29,880
But those who did something wrong must be punished, yes or no?

337
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,395
Yes.

338
00:20:31,395 --> 00:20:33,285
He should be punished, right?

339
00:20:36,014 --> 00:20:37,733
Punish him.

340
00:20:37,733 --> 00:20:38,830
Show me mercy.

341
00:20:44,668 --> 00:20:47,720
I think you are fit for jobs with kids.

342
00:20:48,854 --> 00:20:50,386
How about you continue for 100 more hours?

343
00:20:51,521 --> 00:20:52,585
No.

344
00:20:53,221 --> 00:20:54,410
The kids don't like me.

345
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:56,013
They don't listen to anything I say.

346
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,924
Once I'm done with the social work, I'm out.

347
00:21:02,588 --> 00:21:06,120
But I think you're cute when you do things like this.

348
00:21:08,659 --> 00:21:09,560
Let’s talk about you.

349
00:21:09,841 --> 00:21:10,940
Why are you here?

350
00:21:11,451 --> 00:21:12,952
Did you finish things off with Boeing?

351
00:21:13,588 --> 00:21:14,880
It's not easy at all, Ray.

352
00:21:15,163 --> 00:21:17,069
Boeing was my first love.

353
00:21:17,487 --> 00:21:19,760
We used to plan our future together.

354
00:21:19,914 --> 00:21:21,696
The feelings must have been left there somewhere.

355
00:21:22,238 --> 00:21:25,600
But nothing would’ve happened if you hadn't challenged us to kiss that night.

356
00:21:26,658 --> 00:21:28,876
Do you think you're that important to him?

357
00:21:30,698 --> 00:21:31,793
What do you mean?

358
00:21:32,585 --> 00:21:36,675
If I told you you're not number one on his list,

359
00:21:37,096 --> 00:21:38,472
he didn't miss you,

360
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:42,480
he came to see you just because Top didn't want him,

361
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:43,387
what would you say?

362
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,467
What else do you know, Ray?

363
00:21:45,467 --> 00:21:46,679
I'll handle it.

364
00:21:48,281 --> 00:21:49,652
You're my boyfriend.

365
00:21:49,995 --> 00:21:50,980
I'm not going to let this slide.

366
00:21:51,853 --> 00:21:54,506
The old flames that want to reignite,

367
00:21:54,506 --> 00:21:55,800
they're gonna have to deal with me.

368
00:22:02,951 --> 00:22:03,937
Be careful.

369
00:22:09,872 --> 00:22:11,104
Here. Let me.

370
00:22:13,379 --> 00:22:14,940
Still lots of boxes left.

371
00:22:14,981 --> 00:22:16,059
I just can't throw things away.

372
00:22:16,443 --> 00:22:17,365
That's alright.

373
00:22:17,365 --> 00:22:19,301
I'll order you a new shelf.

374
00:22:19,341 --> 00:22:21,286
You can make that area your own library.

375
00:22:21,493 --> 00:22:22,379
Oh, please.

376
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:24,315
Let's not go that far, Top.

377
00:22:36,757 --> 00:22:40,265
Listen. I'm so happy you decided to move in with me.

378
00:22:40,515 --> 00:22:44,215
From now on, I'll no longer have sleep problems.

379
00:22:44,215 --> 00:22:47,006
Hugging you to sleep is like my sleeping pills.

380
00:22:53,029 --> 00:22:54,152
Hey, Top.

381
00:22:55,236 --> 00:22:57,081
I'd like to ask you a favor.

382
00:22:57,427 --> 00:23:00,161
What is it? I can do anything for you.

383
00:23:00,792 --> 00:23:02,463
Can you and Ray be friends?

384
00:23:04,671 --> 00:23:05,760
Is that even necessary?

385
00:23:06,308 --> 00:23:07,438
It is.

386
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,289
He's my friend.

387
00:23:09,289 --> 00:23:11,563
Don't make me choose between friend and boyfriend.

388
00:23:11,563 --> 00:23:12,487
Hm?

389
00:23:13,355 --> 00:23:17,001
And how do I know that he will not come back to liking you?

390
00:23:17,458 --> 00:23:19,156
He's dating Sand now.

391
00:23:19,932 --> 00:23:21,274
The guy you stole his boyfriend.

392
00:23:26,662 --> 00:23:28,552
There, there.

393
00:23:30,082 --> 00:23:36,121
To start over, you must first accept your past.

394
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,031
Hm?

395
00:23:43,417 --> 00:23:44,307
Who's here?

396
00:23:45,328 --> 00:23:46,407
That's probably Ray.

397
00:23:46,709 --> 00:23:48,041
I asked him to help move.

398
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:55,779
Thank you.

399
00:23:57,479 --> 00:23:58,376
Let me take that.

400
00:23:58,513 --> 00:23:59,150
Okay.

401
00:23:59,150 --> 00:23:59,869
You sure?

402
00:24:10,769 --> 00:24:11,467
Hi.

403
00:24:12,591 --> 00:24:13,317
Hi.

404
00:24:16,677 --> 00:24:17,913
Nice room.

405
00:24:18,041 --> 00:24:19,107
Did you design it yourself?

406
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:21,480
Um.

407
00:24:22,385 --> 00:24:23,572
I did everything.

408
00:24:24,042 --> 00:24:25,686
I designed it and chose the furniture myself.

409
00:24:29,703 --> 00:24:31,237
Mew gave you the chance.

410
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,841
Don't blow it.

411
00:24:33,486 --> 00:24:34,938
I will not make the same mistake.

412
00:24:35,748 --> 00:24:37,364
Or not let yourself get caught?

413
00:24:38,064 --> 00:24:39,461
Are you trying to pick a fight?

414
00:24:39,977 --> 00:24:41,045
I'm not.

415
00:24:41,471 --> 00:24:42,923
I'm just warning you.

416
00:24:42,963 --> 00:24:46,580
Make Mew cry again and you'll have to deal with me.

417
00:24:49,189 --> 00:24:50,586
Let me tell you this as well.

418
00:24:51,341 --> 00:24:53,423
If you don't stop thinking of Mew as more than a friend,

419
00:24:54,186 --> 00:24:55,254
you'll have to deal with me.

420
00:25:06,416 --> 00:25:07,868
Nice couch.

421
00:25:07,868 --> 00:25:08,678
Where did you get it?

422
00:25:10,157 --> 00:25:11,609
It's custom-made.

423
00:25:11,878 --> 00:25:14,344
If you want it, I can give you the shop's contact info

424
00:25:14,344 --> 00:25:15,054
Okay.

425
00:25:15,094 --> 00:25:16,009
You want anything to drink?

426
00:25:16,256 --> 00:25:17,094
Booze?

427
00:25:17,707 --> 00:25:19,186
No. I quit.

428
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:20,845
Just plain water.

429
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,887
Why are you here again?

430
00:25:30,042 --> 00:25:31,003
To cause more problems?

431
00:25:31,551 --> 00:25:32,590
What problem?

432
00:25:33,245 --> 00:25:34,441
I came in peace.

433
00:25:34,931 --> 00:25:36,794
I came to give you Arctic Monkeys concert tickets.

434
00:25:37,713 --> 00:25:40,809
They were sold out but I managed to get them for you.

435
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:42,681
I know you want to go.

436
00:25:43,107 --> 00:25:46,561
Though I don't like rock music, I can go and enjoy it with you.

437
00:25:51,855 --> 00:25:53,252
Arctic Monkeys?

438
00:25:53,568 --> 00:25:54,576
Your favorite band.

439
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:57,069
If you want to go,

440
00:25:57,836 --> 00:25:58,994
I can go with you.

441
00:26:00,526 --> 00:26:01,841
The tickets were sold out.

442
00:26:02,238 --> 00:26:03,392
Can I buy them from you then?

443
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:04,896
Name your price.

444
00:26:06,459 --> 00:26:08,678
I wanna go to concerts with my boyfriend.

445
00:26:09,132 --> 00:26:11,841
Ever since I dated him, I've been listening to English rock bands.

446
00:26:12,042 --> 00:26:14,481
I like the feeling when we sing together and wrap our arms around each other's necks at concerts.

447
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:16,932
So are you selling them?

448
00:26:19,805 --> 00:26:20,608
Oh.

449
00:26:21,458 --> 00:26:22,441
Hi, Mew.

450
00:26:23,774 --> 00:26:25,027
You know Ray too?

451
00:26:25,301 --> 00:26:26,212
Of course, I do.

452
00:26:27,571 --> 00:26:28,995
He's my close friend.

453
00:26:29,668 --> 00:26:31,284
We always tell each other stories.

454
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,148
Right?

455
00:26:36,214 --> 00:26:37,052
So, Boeing,

456
00:26:38,368 --> 00:26:39,777
do you want to come back to Sand?

457
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:44,163
That's up to him.

458
00:26:44,163 --> 00:26:45,230
That's up to me too.

459
00:26:45,374 --> 00:26:47,681
I don't think he wants to get back with Sand.

460
00:26:48,887 --> 00:26:50,099
It's just that Top doesn't want him.

461
00:26:50,373 --> 00:26:51,216
Am I right?

462
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:54,437
You didn't really miss Sand, did you?

463
00:26:55,329 --> 00:26:57,416
If you're trying to bring back something,

464
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:00,041
I suggest you leave.

465
00:27:00,742 --> 00:27:03,208
Sand and I are starting our relationship.

466
00:27:04,379 --> 00:27:06,379
There's no point in digging up the dead past.

467
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:09,380
I won't have any problem if Sand's available.

468
00:27:10,081 --> 00:27:11,588
But he's my boyfriend.

469
00:27:14,536 --> 00:27:15,433
Okay.

470
00:27:16,228 --> 00:27:17,331
I see.

471
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:24,376
Your boyfriend takes ownership of you as if you're his dog.

472
00:27:26,243 --> 00:27:27,092
You're right.

473
00:27:27,448 --> 00:27:30,041
When I love someone, I become a dog.

474
00:27:30,938 --> 00:27:32,938
But at least my owner loves me.

475
00:27:32,938 --> 00:27:33,843
Honest with me.

476
00:27:34,391 --> 00:27:36,391
He doesn't get a new dog when he's bored.

477
00:27:52,002 --> 00:27:52,785
So how was that?

478
00:27:53,224 --> 00:27:55,001
You're pretty scary when you get jealous.

479
00:27:55,001 --> 00:27:56,024
Of course, I am.

480
00:27:56,182 --> 00:27:58,182
I don't like anyone messing with my man.

481
00:27:58,182 --> 00:27:59,844
Old ones or new ones.

482
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:01,110
I clear them all out.

483
00:28:02,081 --> 00:28:03,721
I always win.

484
00:28:04,198 --> 00:28:05,002
Okay.

485
00:28:06,537 --> 00:28:07,459
Look.

486
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:11,106
When my friend here falls for anyone, he falls hard.

487
00:28:12,178 --> 00:28:13,109
Please look out for him.

488
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,061
Now or never?

489
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,378
Are you asking me to marry you or what?

490
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,563
No.

491
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:33,715
But since we've moved in together,

492
00:28:33,867 --> 00:28:36,041
I just want this gift to represent our feelings.

493
00:28:37,347 --> 00:28:40,252
I'm telling you, living with me is not easy.

494
00:28:40,667 --> 00:28:41,595
Same here.

495
00:28:41,814 --> 00:28:43,845
I'm quite a strict person.

496
00:28:45,445 --> 00:28:46,478
Let me go first.

497
00:28:47,163 --> 00:28:49,336
I take a long shower.

498
00:28:49,336 --> 00:28:50,490
I don't like to be rushed.

499
00:28:51,245 --> 00:28:53,464
I don't like food in bed.

500
00:28:53,505 --> 00:28:55,203
I love the scent of my bed sheets.

501
00:28:56,013 --> 00:28:56,795
Okay.

502
00:28:57,754 --> 00:29:00,288
I don't like to see things placed unorganizedly.

503
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:01,887
You must put them back in the same spot you took them from.

504
00:29:01,887 --> 00:29:02,925
Otherwise, I'll get irritated.

505
00:29:03,974 --> 00:29:06,714
I don't like when people get upset and don't say it or do things without telling me.

506
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:08,169
I don't like to guess.

507
00:29:09,868 --> 00:29:11,210
But that's me.

508
00:29:12,042 --> 00:29:13,686
I'll try to improve then.

509
00:29:15,373 --> 00:29:18,961
More importantly, I don't like to fight before bed.

510
00:29:19,328 --> 00:29:20,752
I have trouble sleeping.

511
00:29:20,961 --> 00:29:23,481
Whatever it is, let's discuss it in the morning.

512
00:29:23,872 --> 00:29:24,830
Hey, Top.

513
00:29:25,284 --> 00:29:27,284
When there is a problem, we should patch things up right away.

514
00:29:27,284 --> 00:29:28,528
We can't wait.

515
00:29:30,942 --> 00:29:33,874
Then let’s see what the problem is about first, and we take it from there.

516
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:35,420
Deal.

517
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:40,226
We have a lot of adjustments to make.

518
00:29:40,765 --> 00:29:42,436
Let's take it step by step.

519
00:29:43,579 --> 00:29:44,841
Sure.

520
00:29:44,841 --> 00:29:46,638
I know I'm one difficult person, too.

521
00:29:46,848 --> 00:29:49,287
But I'm sure if we can get through this,

522
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:50,876
we will be together for a long time.

523
00:29:56,095 --> 00:29:56,995
And that,

524
00:29:57,763 --> 00:29:58,507
do you like it?

525
00:30:01,535 --> 00:30:02,425
Not so much.

526
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:03,535
Fine, I won't do it.

527
00:30:04,701 --> 00:30:06,561
I was kidding.

528
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:34,463
This must be the first time you kiss me in public.

529
00:30:34,997 --> 00:30:36,504
Because I know you like it.

530
00:30:36,634 --> 00:30:38,481
You like something like this so much.

531
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:39,827
I do.

532
00:30:40,801 --> 00:30:44,528
Kissing on the dance floor, of course, is one of my dreams.

533
00:30:44,817 --> 00:30:46,762
Is there any place else you want us to kiss?

534
00:30:47,002 --> 00:30:49,139
Is there any romantic thing you want me to do?

535
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:50,114
Tell me.

536
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,966
Um…

537
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,980
Take my hand when crossing the street.

538
00:30:55,655 --> 00:30:57,079
Oh, please.

539
00:30:57,204 --> 00:30:58,902
You can cross the street yourself.

540
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:00,365
I know.

541
00:31:01,187 --> 00:31:04,562
But it's heartwarming to have a boyfriend lead the way.

542
00:31:05,056 --> 00:31:06,272
Fine.

543
00:31:06,738 --> 00:31:07,851
Anything else?

544
00:31:08,153 --> 00:31:09,358
And…

545
00:31:10,826 --> 00:31:13,100
I want you to introduce me as your boyfriend to your friends.

546
00:31:13,882 --> 00:31:14,785
Now that's a problem.

547
00:31:14,785 --> 00:31:15,882
I'm friendless.

548
00:31:16,485 --> 00:31:18,348
I forgot that. I'm sorry.

549
00:31:19,487 --> 00:31:21,185
One more thing.

550
00:31:21,812 --> 00:31:23,017
The new year is approaching.

551
00:31:24,238 --> 00:31:28,212
I'd like you to kiss me during the countdown.

552
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,902
Five, four, three, two, and you turn to kiss me.

553
00:31:31,959 --> 00:31:32,811
Fine.

554
00:31:33,579 --> 00:31:34,617
And…

555
00:31:34,617 --> 00:31:35,372
Enough already.

556
00:31:35,783 --> 00:31:37,098
That's a lot.

557
00:31:37,332 --> 00:31:39,332
Stop it right there.

558
00:31:39,365 --> 00:31:40,433
Hey.

559
00:31:40,433 --> 00:31:42,802
But you said you would be sweet and cheesy with me.

560
00:31:42,842 --> 00:31:44,513
You must keep your word.

561
00:31:44,513 --> 00:31:47,011
Alright, I'll try.

562
00:31:47,011 --> 00:31:48,134
But don't expect it.

563
00:31:48,134 --> 00:31:50,563
On some occasions, things might come as surprises.

564
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:54,919
Our drinks are out. I'm going to get them.

565
00:31:54,919 --> 00:31:55,953
Do you like this?

566
00:31:56,172 --> 00:31:56,900
I do.

567
00:31:57,505 --> 00:31:59,505
I like it when you take care of me.

568
00:31:59,719 --> 00:32:00,954
Alright, dear.

569
00:32:00,954 --> 00:32:02,075
I'll be right back.

570
00:32:10,674 --> 00:32:13,081
One Negroni and one Mojito, please.

571
00:32:13,081 --> 00:32:13,634
Absolutely.

572
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,803
Negroni, sir.

573
00:32:23,881 --> 00:32:24,701
Sorry.

574
00:32:25,249 --> 00:32:26,292
You go ahead.

575
00:32:26,581 --> 00:32:27,704
Thank you.

576
00:32:34,005 --> 00:32:35,761
You like Negroni too?

577
00:32:36,041 --> 00:32:36,832
Yes.

578
00:32:37,343 --> 00:32:39,343
Some people don't like it. They say it's too strong.

579
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:40,826
Too bitter.

580
00:32:43,375 --> 00:32:46,041
I just happen to want something strong tonight.

581
00:32:46,082 --> 00:32:47,534
Bad day?

582
00:32:48,892 --> 00:32:50,015
Bad life.

583
00:32:51,042 --> 00:32:52,681
My life is just f*cked up.

584
00:32:55,277 --> 00:32:57,277
Then I don't think Negroni is enough.

585
00:32:58,169 --> 00:32:59,015
How about some shots?

586
00:32:59,892 --> 00:33:00,854
My treat.

587
00:33:03,569 --> 00:33:07,801
You want to treat me to drinks or you want something else exactly?

588
00:33:09,624 --> 00:33:10,966
I don't want to talk much tonight.

589
00:33:12,041 --> 00:33:13,164
That's good.

590
00:33:13,522 --> 00:33:15,385
I want something fast too.

591
00:33:18,042 --> 00:33:19,000
Here you go.

592
00:33:48,692 --> 00:33:49,801
Are you here alone?

593
00:33:50,326 --> 00:33:51,311
You're cute.

594
00:33:51,421 --> 00:33:52,326
Ah.

595
00:33:52,943 --> 00:33:54,041
No.

596
00:33:54,041 --> 00:33:55,573
I came with my boyfriend.

597
00:33:56,468 --> 00:33:57,363
Sorry.

598
00:34:08,149 --> 00:34:09,409
We got fired up.

599
00:34:09,963 --> 00:34:11,524
Should we continue at my place?

600
00:34:11,871 --> 00:34:13,898
Let's just do it here. My boyfriend is waiting for me.

601
00:34:15,624 --> 00:34:17,048
Will he be okay with this?

602
00:34:17,798 --> 00:34:19,551
He will. We talked about it.

603
00:34:20,243 --> 00:34:23,367
Let's not talk. Just carry on.

604
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,194
Hey.

605
00:34:51,824 --> 00:34:53,016
Here you are.

606
00:34:54,995 --> 00:34:56,447
You're smoking too?

607
00:34:57,461 --> 00:34:58,475
Can I have some?

608
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:11,475
What's wrong? Are you mad?

609
00:35:12,394 --> 00:35:14,257
I was in the bathroom. That's why I took so long.

610
00:35:15,819 --> 00:35:16,545
Ton.

611
00:35:19,259 --> 00:35:21,725
I think you should quit trying to be someone you're not.

612
00:35:23,687 --> 00:35:25,084
What are you talking about?

613
00:35:28,799 --> 00:35:30,963
You're trying to be my boyfriend.

614
00:35:34,789 --> 00:35:36,041
It doesn't seem like you at all.

615
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:39,721
But we talked about it.

616
00:35:40,256 --> 00:35:42,475
We’re boyfriends before I leave for New York.

617
00:35:44,656 --> 00:35:47,807
You're on a date with me but make out with someone else in a club.

618
00:35:50,054 --> 00:35:51,533
Do you think that's what boyfriends do?

619
00:36:04,631 --> 00:36:06,713
I thought I could take who you are.

620
00:36:09,579 --> 00:36:11,579
But once I saw it with my own eyes,

621
00:36:14,362 --> 00:36:15,525
I don't think I can.

622
00:36:16,704 --> 00:36:17,870
Come on.

623
00:36:19,016 --> 00:36:21,345
It was just a kiss. It's no big deal.

624
00:36:24,042 --> 00:36:26,234
You're the only one I go home with.

625
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:27,673
See?

626
00:36:30,195 --> 00:36:31,989
To you, it's not a big deal.

627
00:36:32,963 --> 00:36:34,086
To me,

628
00:36:35,416 --> 00:36:36,950
this is damn difficult.

629
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:43,132
To me, the word ‘boyfriend’ should only apply to me.

630
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:46,344
Look.

631
00:36:47,112 --> 00:36:51,224
To me, the word ‘boyfriend’ is about feelings, not physical things.

632
00:36:52,661 --> 00:36:55,867
I kiss someone else, but my sweet gestures are just for you.

633
00:37:02,582 --> 00:37:03,550
Right now,

634
00:37:04,455 --> 00:37:06,282
you and I don't have much time left.

635
00:37:07,629 --> 00:37:12,178
If you really love me, you must accept who I really am.

636
00:37:17,422 --> 00:37:21,286
I'll let you decide what you’re going to do about it.

637
00:37:39,161 --> 00:37:39,878
Here.

638
00:37:41,386 --> 00:37:42,340
Thanks.

639
00:37:49,064 --> 00:37:52,679
Will you keep on dating Boston after seeing him with someone else?

640
00:37:54,431 --> 00:37:55,414
I'm not sure.

641
00:37:56,593 --> 00:37:57,884
I don't know if I will.

642
00:37:58,371 --> 00:37:59,603
Let me answer that for you.

643
00:38:00,304 --> 00:38:01,111
You will.

644
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:03,045
Why would you think that?

645
00:38:03,455 --> 00:38:05,345
Because you love him so much that you don't love yourself.

646
00:38:06,195 --> 00:38:09,401
You think what he's doing for you is the best thing.

647
00:38:10,607 --> 00:38:11,839
But I think he's being fair.

648
00:38:12,869 --> 00:38:15,390
At least he told me how much he could give me.

649
00:38:16,052 --> 00:38:17,476
So I don't have high hopes.

650
00:38:18,042 --> 00:38:19,713
Different people have different thoughts about this.

651
00:38:20,468 --> 00:38:24,551
Just ask yourself if he's the type of boyfriend you want.

652
00:38:27,808 --> 00:38:29,150
You can do better than that, Nick.

653
00:38:29,643 --> 00:38:31,314
Don't lower the bar.

654
00:38:55,574 --> 00:38:59,650
Thank you guys for not going out of town and joining me at this party.

655
00:39:00,002 --> 00:39:02,843
Because you kept telling us not to go anywhere.

656
00:39:03,073 --> 00:39:04,528
What are you doing, Cheum?

657
00:39:04,528 --> 00:39:05,807
Nothing much.

658
00:39:05,807 --> 00:39:07,524
It's New Year.

659
00:39:07,772 --> 00:39:09,363
It's a happy festival.

660
00:39:09,363 --> 00:39:12,034
We should throw away bad things and start fresh.

661
00:39:12,034 --> 00:39:14,560
I just want to be with the ones I love and care about.

662
00:39:15,642 --> 00:39:16,803
Okay.

663
00:39:17,477 --> 00:39:20,334
Sand, thanks so much for adopting Ray.

664
00:39:20,334 --> 00:39:22,354
He's been wanting a caretaker.

665
00:39:22,627 --> 00:39:24,627
Cheum, I'm not a stray dog.

666
00:39:24,627 --> 00:39:25,704
Okay.

667
00:39:25,704 --> 00:39:27,109
She is right.

668
00:39:27,306 --> 00:39:29,306
You came to me when you needed me.

669
00:39:29,306 --> 00:39:31,441
Like a stray dog that came when he's hungry.

670
00:39:31,441 --> 00:39:32,735
Sand, you jackass.

671
00:39:35,451 --> 00:39:36,723
Ton.

672
00:39:38,884 --> 00:39:40,650
I thought you wouldn't come.

673
00:39:43,933 --> 00:39:46,348
I was dealing with stuff before going to New York. That's why I'm late.

674
00:39:50,533 --> 00:39:51,883
Come on, guys.

675
00:39:51,883 --> 00:39:53,738
Ton is leaving.

676
00:39:53,981 --> 00:39:57,564
Give him a chance to say goodbye and say sorry for the shit he's done.

677
00:39:58,067 --> 00:39:58,914
Right, Ton?

678
00:39:59,796 --> 00:40:00,296
Um.

679
00:40:00,296 --> 00:40:01,598
You want to apologize to them?

680
00:40:02,117 --> 00:40:02,793
Um.

681
00:40:03,813 --> 00:40:04,693
Guys.

682
00:40:05,965 --> 00:40:07,085
I'm going to get more drinks.

683
00:40:08,071 --> 00:40:08,675
Be right back.

684
00:40:14,516 --> 00:40:15,971
If you want to apologize, do it.

685
00:40:17,463 --> 00:40:18,814
I'm waiting to hear it.

686
00:40:20,929 --> 00:40:21,759
I'm sorry.

687
00:40:22,929 --> 00:40:23,891
For what?

688
00:40:23,932 --> 00:40:24,920
You're apologizing to who?

689
00:40:25,347 --> 00:40:26,803
A cat or a dog around here?

690
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:27,988
I’m apologizing to you.

691
00:40:28,083 --> 00:40:29,927
I'm sorry I secretly recorded you and Mew.

692
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:32,986
I'm sorry for telling Sand that you liked Mew when I was drunk.

693
00:40:33,124 --> 00:40:35,487
But I'm not sorry I punched you.

694
00:40:35,487 --> 00:40:36,572
You punched me first.

695
00:40:38,275 --> 00:40:39,652
You deserved that.

696
00:40:42,597 --> 00:40:43,818
But seriously, Ton.

697
00:40:46,296 --> 00:40:49,698
The one that can give you a chance to rejoin this group is Mew.

698
00:40:50,676 --> 00:40:51,803
Apologize to him.

699
00:40:53,585 --> 00:40:57,763
But why did he forgive Top but is still angry with me?

700
00:40:57,873 --> 00:40:59,354
Don't compare yourself to me.

701
00:41:00,301 --> 00:41:03,521
I went through all my process to earn Mew's forgiveness.

702
00:41:08,233 --> 00:41:10,233
I told you to bring Nick.

703
00:41:10,233 --> 00:41:11,550
Why isn't he here?

704
00:41:16,174 --> 00:41:17,235
Look at his face.

705
00:41:17,403 --> 00:41:18,913
You did some shit to him again, didn’t you?

706
00:41:22,518 --> 00:41:23,687
Please excuse me.

707
00:41:34,662 --> 00:41:35,523
Can I get a drink?

708
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:40,321
Make it yourself.

709
00:41:43,261 --> 00:41:44,301
I'm sorry.

710
00:41:49,452 --> 00:41:50,621
I know I'm an asshole.

711
00:41:51,386 --> 00:41:53,386
And I don't expect you to forgive me.

712
00:41:53,403 --> 00:41:57,609
I just want you to know that I did it not because I hated you.

713
00:41:59,055 --> 00:42:01,055
It was because I didn't give a shit about anything.

714
00:42:03,216 --> 00:42:05,709
I'm sorry for letting my desire destroy our friendship.

715
00:42:09,498 --> 00:42:11,293
I am telling you the same thing I told Top.

716
00:42:11,648 --> 00:42:13,882
I forgive you but I'm not going to forget it.

717
00:42:15,976 --> 00:42:18,755
As for our friendship, it ended.

718
00:42:20,111 --> 00:42:21,514
It's not something built easily.

719
00:42:24,604 --> 00:42:25,981
But I guess you don't give a rat’s ass about it anyway, right?

720
00:42:27,447 --> 00:42:29,629
You're running away from all the problems to New York.

721
00:42:30,004 --> 00:42:31,589
I just want to be in a new place.

722
00:42:32,365 --> 00:42:33,612
It might change me into a new person.

723
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:38,123
Not a chance, Ton.

724
00:42:38,323 --> 00:42:42,296
If you change only the surface and not the inner, it won't help.

725
00:42:47,058 --> 00:42:48,747
Don't hurt people who love you again.

726
00:43:02,667 --> 00:43:03,966
Ton. Mew.

727
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,523
Wanna join us for the game?

728
00:43:06,523 --> 00:43:07,276
Sure.

729
00:43:07,276 --> 00:43:08,037
Come on.

730
00:43:16,533 --> 00:43:19,338
Come on guys. Let's start.

731
00:43:19,338 --> 00:43:20,803
Let me go first.

732
00:43:20,803 --> 00:43:22,288
One, two, three.

733
00:43:26,012 --> 00:43:27,218
Truth or Dare?

734
00:43:27,218 --> 00:43:28,363
What should I do?

735
00:43:28,477 --> 00:43:29,672
I’ll go with Truth.

736
00:43:30,196 --> 00:43:32,196
Here's my question.

737
00:43:32,453 --> 00:43:33,337
Come on, April.

738
00:43:33,337 --> 00:43:34,261
Don't be mean.

739
00:43:34,261 --> 00:43:37,994
Out of 10, how much do you rate Top for his skills in bed?

740
00:43:38,271 --> 00:43:41,803
Wow. That's cruel.

741
00:43:42,325 --> 00:43:43,322
Go ahead, Mew.

742
00:43:43,582 --> 00:43:45,156
I'm up for any criticism.

743
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:49,866
10 out of 10, of course.

744
00:43:49,866 --> 00:43:51,297
Boo!

745
00:43:51,297 --> 00:43:52,607
That can't be true.

746
00:43:52,807 --> 00:43:54,323
That good?

747
00:43:54,323 --> 00:43:55,622
How about more details?

748
00:43:55,622 --> 00:43:56,866
Stop it, Cheum.

749
00:43:56,996 --> 00:43:58,269
You, nosy girl.

750
00:43:58,593 --> 00:44:00,723
What's in bed should stay in bed.

751
00:44:00,723 --> 00:44:02,495
My turn.

752
00:44:05,064 --> 00:44:06,049
So, Sand.

753
00:44:07,217 --> 00:44:08,024
Truth or Dare?

754
00:44:09,646 --> 00:44:10,455
Dare.

755
00:44:12,837 --> 00:44:14,625
I dare you…

756
00:44:15,104 --> 00:44:16,803
to kiss…

757
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:19,750
Top.

758
00:44:19,906 --> 00:44:20,775
What?

759
00:44:20,775 --> 00:44:21,298
Mew.

760
00:44:22,067 --> 00:44:23,207
Do you dare?

761
00:44:23,804 --> 00:44:24,664
Come on.

762
00:44:25,327 --> 00:44:26,249
What do you say, Sand?

763
00:44:26,612 --> 00:44:27,690
You chose Dare yourself.

764
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:29,015
Fine.

765
00:44:29,283 --> 00:44:30,360
I'm not afraid.

766
00:44:30,909 --> 00:44:31,803
Damn.

767
00:44:38,574 --> 00:44:40,243
I'm sorry I stole your boyfriend.

768
00:44:40,243 --> 00:44:42,293
Asshole. Shut your mouth.

769
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:48,803
Hey.

770
00:44:49,612 --> 00:44:50,360
Hey!

771
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:51,612
Enough.

772
00:44:52,206 --> 00:44:54,563
Alright. I can tell you're not afraid of him.

773
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:57,234
You guys just can't lose, can you?

774
00:44:57,554 --> 00:44:58,620
Here's what I think, Mew.

775
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:00,541
Giving him 10 out of 10 is too much.

776
00:45:00,541 --> 00:45:01,188
He sucks.

777
00:45:01,188 --> 00:45:02,760
Oh, please. You suck.

778
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:03,978
You came in without rhythm.

779
00:45:04,158 --> 00:45:06,158
I didn't want to have rhythm with you.

780
00:45:06,378 --> 00:45:08,378
Alright, guys. Stop it.

781
00:45:08,793 --> 00:45:11,208
Okay. Let's continue.

782
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:12,869
Sand, it's your turn.

783
00:45:15,189 --> 00:45:17,708
[Can you come to the hostel? I want to see you before I go to New York.]

784
00:45:19,876 --> 00:45:22,283
Guys, Top and I are going to see the fireworks display.

785
00:45:22,387 --> 00:45:23,214
Want to join us?

786
00:45:23,324 --> 00:45:24,224
No.

787
00:45:24,535 --> 00:45:25,635
I've watched it so many times.

788
00:45:26,173 --> 00:45:28,173
I'll stay here and swim with April.

789
00:45:28,173 --> 00:45:28,722
Right?

790
00:45:30,964 --> 00:45:32,054
What about you, Ray?

791
00:45:32,417 --> 00:45:33,327
What do you say, Sand?

792
00:45:33,327 --> 00:45:34,101
I'm up for anything.

793
00:45:36,298 --> 00:45:38,609
Okay. I haven't seen fireworks in a long time.

794
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:41,083
I'm always in the club during the countdown.

795
00:45:46,027 --> 00:45:46,881
What about you, Ton?

796
00:45:47,686 --> 00:45:48,417
Wanna come?

797
00:45:49,528 --> 00:45:51,684
You're just being nice or you want me to go for real?

798
00:45:52,397 --> 00:45:53,481
Don't ask questions.

799
00:45:53,689 --> 00:45:54,916
Yes or no?

800
00:45:55,091 --> 00:45:56,119
Yes.

801
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:01,062
Hey, Nick.

802
00:46:02,264 --> 00:46:03,330
Why did you come just now?

803
00:46:05,444 --> 00:46:07,029
Sorry, I'm late.

804
00:46:07,221 --> 00:46:08,910
It took me a while to decide to come.

805
00:46:10,817 --> 00:46:13,203
We are going to see the fireworks. Wanna come?

806
00:46:15,529 --> 00:46:16,246
Sure.

807
00:46:16,454 --> 00:46:18,603
I don't want to count down by myself.

808
00:46:22,004 --> 00:46:22,683
Let's go.

809
00:46:22,994 --> 00:46:23,770
Right.

810
00:46:24,763 --> 00:46:25,602
Bye, guys.

811
00:46:25,758 --> 00:46:26,414
Bye.

812
00:46:26,414 --> 00:46:27,043
See you.

813
00:46:27,043 --> 00:46:27,941
Bye, Cheum.

814
00:47:09,373 --> 00:47:10,285
Cheum.

815
00:47:10,285 --> 00:47:11,036
Am I heavy?

816
00:47:11,036 --> 00:47:11,753
No.

817
00:47:11,753 --> 00:47:13,053
But you're sliding down my back.

818
00:47:13,053 --> 00:47:14,699
Let's go, chauffeur.

819
00:47:15,271 --> 00:47:16,440
We have arrived, ma'am.

820
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,016
Thank you so much.

821
00:47:25,785 --> 00:47:29,654
Come to think of it, this year has been pretty tough for me.

822
00:47:30,685 --> 00:47:31,548
But it's good.

823
00:47:32,456 --> 00:47:33,879
I got to know myself better.

824
00:47:34,708 --> 00:47:35,981
Next year, it'll be better.

825
00:47:36,844 --> 00:47:37,668
What about you guys?

826
00:47:38,083 --> 00:47:39,129
What's your plan for next year?

827
00:47:39,493 --> 00:47:40,304
I have a plan.

828
00:47:40,771 --> 00:47:41,960
I plan to quit drinking.

829
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:44,269
Bye-bye, bars.

830
00:47:44,576 --> 00:47:45,849
No more bars.

831
00:47:46,303 --> 00:47:47,027
That's good.

832
00:47:47,563 --> 00:47:49,003
But how do I socialize with people?

833
00:47:49,225 --> 00:47:50,576
You can stay with me.

834
00:47:51,575 --> 00:47:53,323
I plan to quit being a bar singer.

835
00:47:53,691 --> 00:47:54,448
Why?

836
00:47:54,803 --> 00:47:59,083
Because if I still work in the bar, when you stop by, you'll see people drinking.

837
00:47:59,083 --> 00:48:00,444
Then you won't be able to stop yourself.

838
00:48:00,571 --> 00:48:02,285
You don't have to do that.

839
00:48:02,402 --> 00:48:03,468
I can handle it.

840
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:05,461
What should I say now?

841
00:48:05,461 --> 00:48:07,057
Sand started it off so grand.

842
00:48:07,545 --> 00:48:09,643
Mew, should I buy you a building?

843
00:48:09,947 --> 00:48:11,376
Is there any business you want to run?

844
00:48:11,596 --> 00:48:12,921
I want to do something with you.

845
00:48:14,855 --> 00:48:15,915
You don't have to do that.

846
00:48:16,434 --> 00:48:18,883
Just don't be an asshole like you were this year. That's all I want.

847
00:48:19,716 --> 00:48:21,275
That serves you right, Top.

848
00:48:21,275 --> 00:48:22,684
You just love to flaunt your riches.

849
00:48:23,174 --> 00:48:25,252
Mew, yell at him more.

850
00:48:28,703 --> 00:48:30,443
I will work hard on photography

851
00:48:30,651 --> 00:48:32,651
and have my own exhibition.

852
00:48:33,494 --> 00:48:35,286
‘In the Bedroom’ by Boston.

853
00:48:35,286 --> 00:48:36,528
You don't have to study.

854
00:48:36,804 --> 00:48:37,952
You have a lot already.

855
00:48:38,523 --> 00:48:39,375
Nick.

856
00:48:40,322 --> 00:48:41,017
What about you?

857
00:48:41,803 --> 00:48:42,667
Well…

858
00:48:43,194 --> 00:48:44,934
I haven't planned anything big.

859
00:48:45,388 --> 00:48:47,025
I just want to focus more on myself.

860
00:48:48,542 --> 00:48:50,776
This year, I feel like I’ve wasted so much time on who knows what.

861
00:48:51,928 --> 00:48:52,682
That's good.

862
00:48:53,836 --> 00:48:55,483
Someone like you should find good love.

863
00:49:00,857 --> 00:49:01,833
Hey, guys.

864
00:49:01,833 --> 00:49:02,935
It’s the last 10 seconds. Come on.

865
00:49:04,404 --> 00:49:09,597
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six…

866
00:49:09,853 --> 00:49:14,916
five, four, three, two, one.

867
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:17,833
Happy New Year!

868
00:49:26,748 --> 00:49:28,748
Woo-hoo!

869
00:49:47,243 --> 00:49:50,800
Because of your plan, the guys have reconciled again.

870
00:49:52,709 --> 00:49:55,410
I just don't want to end this year with hatred, April.

871
00:49:56,444 --> 00:49:57,302
That's great.

872
00:49:57,925 --> 00:50:00,728
Being with you gives me so much positive energy.

873
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:04,525
Then be with me for a long, long time.

874
00:50:14,103 --> 00:50:15,039
We're taking off now.

875
00:50:15,870 --> 00:50:16,934
I'm sleepy.

876
00:50:17,090 --> 00:50:17,973
Let's go, Top.

877
00:50:18,934 --> 00:50:20,129
We can come back for the car tomorrow.

878
00:50:20,494 --> 00:50:21,560
Sure.

879
00:50:21,804 --> 00:50:22,636
Come on, Ray.

880
00:50:22,636 --> 00:50:23,416
Are you leaving?

881
00:50:23,738 --> 00:50:26,257
We'll just hang around here a little bit more.

882
00:50:26,695 --> 00:50:27,683
You guys go ahead.

883
00:50:29,044 --> 00:50:32,212
Thanks a lot, Mew, for asking me to come.

884
00:50:34,196 --> 00:50:36,803
Next year, if you guys have time, join the countdown in New York.

885
00:50:37,197 --> 00:50:38,007
I'll be waiting there.

886
00:50:41,804 --> 00:50:42,614
No, thanks.

887
00:50:43,496 --> 00:50:45,568
You and I don't need to be friends anymore.

888
00:50:45,568 --> 00:50:48,540
Actually, I was nice to you today because Cheum asked me to.

889
00:50:48,976 --> 00:50:50,379
I just didn't want to kill the mood.

890
00:50:51,939 --> 00:50:52,532
But…

891
00:50:52,532 --> 00:50:55,393
I wish you the best of luck in your efforts to improve yourself.

892
00:51:12,016 --> 00:51:13,393
Ton, where's Nick?

893
00:51:14,651 --> 00:51:15,503
I have no clue.

894
00:51:16,803 --> 00:51:17,951
I'm gonna go find him.

895
00:51:24,935 --> 00:51:26,935
See you.

896
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:34,989
Mew is savage.

897
00:51:36,118 --> 00:51:37,054
Yeah.

898
00:51:38,505 --> 00:51:40,505
Have you seen the movie Begin Again?

899
00:51:42,698 --> 00:51:43,472
No.

900
00:51:44,225 --> 00:51:46,723
But I heard the original soundtrack, Lost Star.

901
00:51:47,112 --> 00:51:48,044
I like it so much.

902
00:51:48,433 --> 00:51:50,903
Keira Knightley is pretty.

903
00:51:51,361 --> 00:51:52,132
And cute.

904
00:51:52,469 --> 00:51:53,698
I like her too.

905
00:51:54,122 --> 00:51:55,185
You know what?

906
00:51:55,471 --> 00:51:58,303
My life is like her story in the movie.

907
00:51:59,058 --> 00:52:02,330
There's one scene from the movie I wanna do with someone I like.

908
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:04,715
Kiss scene?

909
00:52:04,883 --> 00:52:06,468
No, you jackass.

910
00:52:07,123 --> 00:52:10,203
It's the scene where they walk around the city and listen to music together.

911
00:52:16,445 --> 00:52:18,211
Would you like to take a walk and listen to music with me?

912
00:52:20,612 --> 00:52:21,370
Let's do it.

913
00:52:21,803 --> 00:52:23,563
I'll be your Keira Knightley.

914
00:52:23,838 --> 00:52:25,630
Oh, please.

915
00:52:26,499 --> 00:52:28,188
You think you're that pretty?

916
00:52:30,692 --> 00:52:33,834
Should I call you Pretty Rich Boy Ray from now on?

917
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:35,190
Of course.

918
00:53:51,716 --> 00:53:52,437
Hey.

919
00:53:53,835 --> 00:53:55,114
Why are you sitting here all by yourself?

920
00:53:57,821 --> 00:53:58,702
Let's go home.

921
00:53:58,954 --> 00:53:59,961
Crash at my place.

922
00:54:02,535 --> 00:54:03,948
I've got you a New Year present.

923
00:54:06,813 --> 00:54:07,433
What for?

924
00:54:08,188 --> 00:54:09,400
Just take a look.

925
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:10,044
Look.

926
00:54:16,027 --> 00:54:18,866
You are so damn cute in this picture.

927
00:54:18,866 --> 00:54:20,408
I told you

928
00:54:21,070 --> 00:54:22,965
if the picture was taken by someone who really knew your angles,

929
00:54:23,636 --> 00:54:24,887
it'd be as nice as this one.

930
00:54:27,902 --> 00:54:28,717
I like it.

931
00:54:30,199 --> 00:54:31,300
Thank you.

932
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:32,059
Um.

933
00:54:37,486 --> 00:54:38,843
But I don't think I can take it.

934
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:43,119
And I'm not taking your offer.

935
00:54:47,557 --> 00:54:48,522
Why not?

936
00:54:51,654 --> 00:54:53,990
I think I’ll come back to loving myself more than I love you.

937
00:54:58,826 --> 00:54:59,826
Hey, Nick.

938
00:54:59,826 --> 00:55:00,826
I'm sorry.

939
00:55:01,370 --> 00:55:02,839
I will not kiss anyone else ever again.

940
00:55:02,839 --> 00:55:04,572
I'll have only you. I really am sorry.

941
00:55:07,619 --> 00:55:08,586
Don't be.

942
00:55:09,397 --> 00:55:10,766
I'm over that.

943
00:55:12,643 --> 00:55:14,196
And don't blame yourself.

944
00:55:22,974 --> 00:55:24,134
Listen to me, Ton.

945
00:55:25,588 --> 00:55:27,099
I'm not picking at you or anything.

946
00:55:28,978 --> 00:55:33,103
I think maybe you're the type of person who should roll alone.

947
00:55:34,775 --> 00:55:36,412
As I said before,

948
00:55:36,803 --> 00:55:39,726
stop trying to be someone you're not.

949
00:55:39,974 --> 00:55:41,275
It's not going to last long.

950
00:55:45,748 --> 00:55:55,605
You should go back to living a fun and sassy life that you prefer instead of trying to please a daydreaming guy like me.

951
00:56:01,487 --> 00:56:02,704
Happy New Year.

952
00:56:04,493 --> 00:56:06,493
I'm glad to have known you this year.

953
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:09,265
And…

954
00:56:10,216 --> 00:56:13,111
good luck with the life you chose in New York.

955
00:56:49,797 --> 00:56:50,734
Hey.

956
00:56:51,265 --> 00:56:53,069
Why are you arranging the books now?

957
00:56:53,349 --> 00:56:54,594
Why don’t you go take a shower?

958
00:56:56,495 --> 00:56:58,243
I want to get it done.

959
00:56:58,243 --> 00:56:59,568
Organize them nicely.

960
00:57:00,266 --> 00:57:02,713
So that when I wake up tomorrow, the new year, I can see a new room

961
00:57:02,713 --> 00:57:04,068
and begin a new life.

962
00:57:04,068 --> 00:57:04,835
Doesn’t it sound good?

963
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:07,537
You can have anything new you want

964
00:57:08,263 --> 00:57:10,990
except for a new boyfriend.

965
00:57:19,574 --> 00:57:20,372
Mew.

966
00:57:22,765 --> 00:57:27,533
Thank you for being the reason I want to be a better man.

967
00:57:31,385 --> 00:57:33,273
Thank you too

968
00:57:35,845 --> 00:57:37,845
for helping me to see that side of myself.

969
00:57:38,879 --> 00:57:45,912
Because of you, I know how far I can go when I love someone.

970
00:57:46,248 --> 00:57:47,032
No.

971
00:57:48,486 --> 00:57:50,054
No more of that, please.

972
00:57:50,545 --> 00:57:53,132
I prefer the cute you as before.

973
00:57:53,619 --> 00:57:56,178
How about you go back to wearing glasses?

974
00:57:56,178 --> 00:57:57,120
No.

975
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:58,728
Look. You’re so cute.

976
00:57:58,728 --> 00:57:59,880
Glasses?

977
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:00,959
No.

978
00:58:05,027 --> 00:58:07,698
Top, can I hear your opinion?

979
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:12,809
Do you think I’m mean by not giving Boston a chance?

980
00:58:15,984 --> 00:58:16,866
No.

981
00:58:18,123 --> 00:58:20,850
Though I shared the same guilt as Boston,

982
00:58:21,647 --> 00:58:22,892
this is your life.

983
00:58:23,926 --> 00:58:26,709
You have the right to choose who to keep and who to let go.

984
00:58:29,521 --> 00:58:30,598
And thanks

985
00:58:32,499 --> 00:58:33,828
for choosing to keep me.

986
00:58:55,873 --> 00:58:57,208
Ever since we got back together,

987
00:58:58,746 --> 00:59:00,081
we haven’t done it yet.

988
00:59:06,009 --> 00:59:07,129
Too bad.

989
00:59:08,095 --> 00:59:09,536
You just never initiate it.

990
00:59:11,521 --> 00:59:12,766
I’ve been waiting for you.

991
00:59:13,828 --> 00:59:14,557
Well…

992
00:59:17,224 --> 00:59:18,833
I thought you weren’t ready.

993
00:59:19,503 --> 00:59:20,720
Oh, I so am.

994
00:59:21,530 --> 00:59:23,222
I’ve been ready since we were at my mom’s.

995
00:59:24,145 --> 00:59:25,809
I just didn’t want to start it.

996
00:59:27,179 --> 00:59:30,493
I was afraid someone would cry while doing it.

997
00:59:30,493 --> 00:59:31,279
Wow.

998
00:59:31,643 --> 00:59:32,620
Are you teasing me?

999
00:59:32,894 --> 00:59:33,833
No.

1000
00:59:39,926 --> 00:59:41,926
Then I will show you

1001
00:59:43,128 --> 00:59:44,429
what you’ve been missing

1002
00:59:46,171 --> 00:59:47,528
all this time.

1003
01:00:20,308 --> 01:00:21,609
How did you like that, Mew?

1004
01:00:21,735 --> 01:00:25,654
Since you told your friends I got 10 out of 10, I did my best.

1005
01:00:28,979 --> 01:00:30,392
I was just saving your face there.

1006
01:00:30,951 --> 01:00:32,280
What do you mean?

1007
01:00:32,643 --> 01:00:33,934
I’m not good in bed?

1008
01:00:35,530 --> 01:00:36,563
You are.

1009
01:00:36,871 --> 01:00:39,236
It's just that I experienced the better.

1010
01:00:40,018 --> 01:00:40,800
Hold on.

1011
01:00:44,055 --> 01:00:45,288
I'm not your first?

1012
01:00:48,783 --> 01:00:49,550
Top.

1013
01:00:50,947 --> 01:00:51,771
I…

1014
01:00:55,182 --> 01:00:56,470
I'm kidding.

1015
01:00:58,386 --> 01:00:59,603
You're wicked.

1016
01:01:00,470 --> 01:01:01,854
I was joking.

1017
01:01:04,444 --> 01:01:05,298
Mew.

1018
01:01:05,539 --> 01:01:10,139
Seriously, I don't care if I'm your first or not.

1019
01:01:10,666 --> 01:01:11,449
Why?

1020
01:01:12,036 --> 01:01:14,959
Are you about to say "But you're my last, Mew"?

1021
01:01:15,246 --> 01:01:16,994
If so, I'm going to go puke in the bathroom.

1022
01:01:16,994 --> 01:01:18,460
I won't say anything so lame.

1023
01:01:19,746 --> 01:01:20,795
Lame, huh?

1024
01:01:22,288 --> 01:01:26,469
Then who asked me to be his boyfriend in front of people in the bar?

1025
01:01:27,344 --> 01:01:28,869
Because I wanted you bad then.

1026
01:01:29,094 --> 01:01:30,647
I was willing to do anything.

1027
01:01:30,775 --> 01:01:32,775
But it's worth the embarrassment.

1028
01:01:32,775 --> 01:01:36,099
Otherwise, I wouldn't be hugging you right now.

1029
01:01:42,363 --> 01:01:43,324
Top.

1030
01:01:43,827 --> 01:01:45,090
Will you surrender?

1031
01:01:45,593 --> 01:01:46,556
Yes.

1032
01:01:52,516 --> 01:01:53,894
What's happening, Top?

1033
01:01:57,654 --> 01:01:58,378
Hello.

1034
01:01:58,741 --> 01:01:59,849
What's happening?

1035
01:02:00,441 --> 01:02:02,245
Okay. I'll be right down.

1036
01:02:03,838 --> 01:02:05,838
Mew, there's a fire. Let's go now.

1037
01:02:07,312 --> 01:02:08,389
Come on.

1038
01:02:11,788 --> 01:02:13,005
Mew, be careful.

1039
01:02:16,088 --> 01:02:17,669
Let’s go.

1040
01:02:25,397 --> 01:02:26,334
Mew.

1041
01:02:26,893 --> 01:02:28,002
Are you alright?

1042
01:02:28,002 --> 01:02:28,893
I'm alright.

1043
01:02:28,893 --> 01:02:30,073
Don't worry.

1044
01:02:31,743 --> 01:02:33,414
Let’s sit there.

1045
01:02:37,331 --> 01:02:38,483
Wait for me here.

1046
01:02:38,483 --> 01:02:39,694
I'm going to go talk to the staff.

1047
01:02:42,579 --> 01:02:43,300
Excuse me.

1048
01:02:59,601 --> 01:03:01,663
The firefighters are putting out the fire.

1049
01:03:01,663 --> 01:03:02,618
It's not spreading anymore.

1050
01:03:02,796 --> 01:03:04,034
I think it's only happening in the kitchen.

1051
01:03:05,654 --> 01:03:06,934
Does anyone get injured?

1052
01:03:07,668 --> 01:03:08,389
No.

1053
01:03:09,256 --> 01:03:10,535
Everyone evacuated in time.

1054
01:03:27,011 --> 01:03:27,755
Top.

1055
01:03:29,011 --> 01:03:30,267
Are you okay?

1056
01:03:36,334 --> 01:03:37,652
I just recall when I was a kid.

1057
01:03:38,603 --> 01:03:39,593
But I'm okay.

1058
01:03:42,816 --> 01:03:43,912
I must thank you.

1059
01:03:45,547 --> 01:03:48,632
Without you, I must have been out of my mind.

1060
01:03:50,739 --> 01:03:51,670
No.

1061
01:03:51,950 --> 01:03:53,550
I didn't help you at all.

1062
01:03:53,935 --> 01:03:56,215
You're the one with leadership.

1063
01:03:56,314 --> 01:03:57,392
You can control everything.

1064
01:03:57,616 --> 01:03:58,622
You did great.

1065
01:04:03,878 --> 01:04:04,843
You did help.

1066
01:04:04,968 --> 01:04:06,168
Because I have you,

1067
01:04:07,342 --> 01:04:08,798
everything is fine.

1068
01:04:31,504 --> 01:04:32,119
Sand.

1069
01:04:34,244 --> 01:04:34,902
What?

1070
01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:40,307
I think you should go back to selling booze.

1071
01:04:42,096 --> 01:04:42,798
Why?

1072
01:04:43,553 --> 01:04:44,432
I don't know.

1073
01:04:45,913 --> 01:04:48,249
I think it's the business that can help build your life.

1074
01:04:48,947 --> 01:04:51,894
I don't want you to quit because I yelled at you or made a sarcastic remark to you.

1075
01:04:51,894 --> 01:04:53,504
It's not just that.

1076
01:04:54,108 --> 01:04:58,149
If I'm with you and selling booze at the same time, it's risky for you.

1077
01:04:58,282 --> 01:04:59,099
Damn you.

1078
01:04:59,267 --> 01:05:01,934
Anywhere can be risky.

1079
01:05:01,934 --> 01:05:03,805
Booze is sold everywhere.

1080
01:05:03,805 --> 01:05:06,143
You can't force the rest of the world to quit selling.

1081
01:05:06,674 --> 01:05:07,557
Right?

1082
01:05:09,207 --> 01:05:10,760
I must fight it myself.

1083
01:05:12,828 --> 01:05:14,185
And you must trust me.

1084
01:05:15,778 --> 01:05:16,548
Let’s do this.

1085
01:05:17,135 --> 01:05:20,774
Once the Liquor Liberalization Act is approved, I'll be your investor.

1086
01:05:21,158 --> 01:05:21,978
Damn you.

1087
01:05:21,978 --> 01:05:26,734
Haven't you heard that people in a relationship shouldn't risk doing business together?

1088
01:05:26,973 --> 01:05:28,000
What risk?

1089
01:05:28,140 --> 01:05:31,494
I'm rich and I want you to be rich too.

1090
01:05:32,307 --> 01:05:35,705
Alright, Young Master Ray from high society.

1091
01:05:38,381 --> 01:05:39,451
Is that a deal?

1092
01:05:40,381 --> 01:05:41,311
Yes.

1093
01:05:46,876 --> 01:05:47,528
By the way,

1094
01:05:48,311 --> 01:05:49,659
I want to rename the brand.

1095
01:05:50,013 --> 01:05:51,398
What's the old name again?

1096
01:05:52,963 --> 01:05:54,005
Jude.

1097
01:05:54,005 --> 01:05:55,802
I named it after the song Hey Jude by The Beatles.

1098
01:05:57,028 --> 01:06:01,153
I want an easy yet meaningful name.

1099
01:06:01,778 --> 01:06:02,444
Like…

1100
01:06:03,087 --> 01:06:04,281
RaySand.

1101
01:06:04,564 --> 01:06:05,549
Or SandRay.

1102
01:06:05,829 --> 01:06:07,934
I think it sounds nice when we put our names together.

1103
01:06:09,822 --> 01:06:11,011
I agree.

1104
01:06:11,458 --> 01:06:13,346
But I actually prefer SandRay.

1105
01:06:13,514 --> 01:06:15,290
It sounds like ‘sunray’.

1106
01:06:15,486 --> 01:06:18,660
It gives the vibes of ‘the light of hope’.

1107
01:06:20,055 --> 01:06:21,124
Should I let you win this time?

1108
01:06:22,830 --> 01:06:23,537
Um.

1109
01:06:25,230 --> 01:06:26,223
It's good.

1110
01:06:27,286 --> 01:06:28,755
We can save up money

1111
01:06:29,118 --> 01:06:31,314
and go to music festivals around the world together.

1112
01:06:31,817 --> 01:06:32,700
It's so good.

1113
01:06:37,397 --> 01:06:41,282
Thank you for giving my life a clear goal.

1114
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:48,468
You're making my life more fun too.

1116
01:07:36,568 --> 01:07:39,714
Thank you guys for inviting me to be the guest of honor.

1117
01:07:40,196 --> 01:07:41,414
Look at this place.

1118
01:07:41,414 --> 01:07:45,051
I've seen you all since freshman year when you were still completely wasted.

1119
01:07:45,051 --> 01:07:47,645
Today, you are running a business. Gosh!

1120
01:07:48,659 --> 01:07:53,654
But I'm warning you here. Doing business together isn't an easy job.

1121
01:07:53,654 --> 01:07:54,995
I've been through a lot myself.

1122
01:07:55,255 --> 01:07:59,604
Especially, you guys are close friends. You must be calmer. Got it?

1123
01:08:00,026 --> 01:08:03,654
You must separate love from money.

1124
01:08:03,654 --> 01:08:08,156
Good friendship is as hard to find as a husband.

1125
01:08:08,518 --> 01:08:13,694
But I'm lucky to have you guys as my good younger pals and Plug as my boyfriend.

1126
01:08:13,694 --> 01:08:17,038
Come on, Yo. That’s too much.

1127
01:08:17,038 --> 01:08:21,175
Are you wishing us luck with the business or praising your boyfriend?

1128
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:22,077
Let me just.

1129
01:08:22,916 --> 01:08:25,974
You just have to ruin my moments, don't you?

1130
01:08:26,370 --> 01:08:29,488
Alright. I wish you guys big financial success.

1131
01:08:29,488 --> 01:08:36,075
Plug and I will find 365 days a year to spend our staycation here.

1132
01:08:36,075 --> 01:08:38,618
Spare us the suite.

1133
01:08:38,618 --> 01:08:39,362
Yo.

1134
01:08:39,362 --> 01:08:42,550
If you are coming, we’ll close the place just for you. Have it all to yourself.

1135
01:08:42,550 --> 01:08:43,534
Keep your word.

1136
01:08:43,534 --> 01:08:44,363
Of course.

1137
01:08:44,363 --> 01:08:46,146
Let me record that.

1138
01:08:46,896 --> 01:08:49,259
April, I'm so nervous.

1139
01:08:49,259 --> 01:08:50,716
Don't be.

1140
01:08:50,716 --> 01:08:53,243
Everything is nicely set up.

1141
01:08:53,573 --> 01:08:55,573
Right. Don't worry, Cheum.

1142
01:08:55,573 --> 01:08:58,296
My design will be all over social media.

1143
01:08:59,518 --> 01:09:02,720
Everyone took part in this but I didn't help with anything.

1144
01:09:03,137 --> 01:09:06,535
Come on. You did.

1145
01:09:06,535 --> 01:09:08,063
You are the hostel owner's boyfriend.

1146
01:09:08,063 --> 01:09:11,672
And you're the best emotional supporter for me.

1147
01:09:11,672 --> 01:09:13,113
You helped the most. Don't you know that?

1148
01:09:13,548 --> 01:09:14,464
Huh?

1149
01:09:15,107 --> 01:09:16,191
Yuck!

1150
01:09:16,643 --> 01:09:19,774
Too much love is overflowing here.

1151
01:09:20,910 --> 01:09:22,407
Oh, I forgot.

1152
01:09:22,655 --> 01:09:26,333
Ton sent us this picture.

1153
01:09:26,333 --> 01:09:27,427
Let’s open it.

1154
01:09:29,474 --> 01:09:31,306
Look at this.

1155
01:09:31,306 --> 01:09:32,184
Yo, look.

1156
01:09:32,483 --> 01:09:36,254
It was taken the first day we were here.

1157
01:09:36,618 --> 01:09:37,556
Cute, right?

1158
01:09:42,214 --> 01:09:43,388
The first guest is here.

1159
01:09:44,054 --> 01:09:45,746
Say it like we practiced.

1160
01:09:46,450 --> 01:09:48,841
Welcome to Only Friends Stay.

1161
01:09:48,841 --> 01:09:50,508
The place that offers you a friendly stay.

1162
01:09:55,163 --> 01:09:57,974
Uh…I booked a single bedded room.

1163
01:09:58,489 --> 01:09:59,574
I'm here alone.

1164
01:10:00,311 --> 01:10:01,920
Don't worry if you're alone.

1165
01:10:02,227 --> 01:10:04,227
We can be your friends.

1166
01:10:09,095 --> 01:10:10,480
Then…can I be your friend too?

1167
01:11:20,797 --> 01:11:21,977
Three, two, one.

1168
01:11:21,977 --> 01:11:25,537
Only Friends! Yeah!

1169
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:28,473
Awesome.
