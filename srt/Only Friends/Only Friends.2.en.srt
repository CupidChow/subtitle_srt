1
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,450
This is my friend Top.

2
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,140
He’s the one designing our hostel.

3
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:14,780
Top.

4
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,610
I’m not ready.

5
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:18,440
Why am I at your place?

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,340
Did we have sex?

7
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:20,760
I really am sorry.

8
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,030
And thanks for saving my life.

9
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:27,330
Can I have a number to call when the phone is done?

10
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,130
Mew.

11
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,410
Will you be my boyfriend?

12
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,880
Mew.

13
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,940
Will you be my boyfriend?

14
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:12,640
Gosh! My friend isn’t single anymore.

15
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:13,820
My friend.

16
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,090
He’s my friend.

17
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,960
I’m so damn happy.

18
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,660
He’s been holding onto his singleness all his life until tonight.

19
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,750
The first relationship proposal he got was just grand.

20
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,020
Plus, he’s got himself a top-tier.

21
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,460
I’m so happy for my friend.

22
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,760
I’m used to seeing drunk people fight.

23
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,180
Seeing people confess once in a while in my bar,

24
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,060
of course, makes me happy.

25
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,230
Everyone has a lover.

26
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:37,530
Cheum has one, too.

27
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,090
I do, too.

28
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,130
Why would people want a relationship?

29
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:44,940
We can just have fun.

30
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:47,880
I get it though.

31
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,200
Mew always has his head in the clouds.

32
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:52,120
He sure likes something like this.

33
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,180
It’s not my business.

34
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,320
But asking someone out in front of all people in the bar?

35
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,480
It’s just so lame.

36
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,880
Who’s he, a romantic movie protagonist?

37
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:01,600
Annoying!

38
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:06,940
Well, I want him.

39
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,630
I just had to make it huge.

Directed by Pinya Chookamsri & Tichakorn Phukhaotong

41
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,490
In that corner, you can place a nice-looking coffee machine.

42
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:21,190
Got it.

43
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,880
Over here should be a bookshelf.

44
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,710
It should be a useful common area.

45
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:27,450
I think it’s okay now.

46
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,220
Cool, isn’t he?

47
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:39,620
When people do things in their area of expertise, they shine.

48
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,880
But this one doesn’t shine so bright as his concentration is always with you.

49
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:45,470
What are you talking about?

50
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,680
He just smiles.

51
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,980
Why are you blushing?

52
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:50,850
I’m not.

53
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:53,260
You guys are boyfriends now. No need to blush.

54
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,510
Look at your red cheeks.

55
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,480
Let me warn you here.

56
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,220
Top has never been with anyone for more than three months.

57
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:03,670
Really?

58
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,010
Why?

59
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,610
He’s probably bored.

60
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,620
He’s someone who can choose.

61
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,460
But right now, he might just want to do you first.

62
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,800
Are you saying he asked me to be his boyfriend

63
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,370
because I haven’t slept with him yet?

64
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,010
Possibly.

65
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,920
Don’t think too much.

66
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,470
You might be the one that breaks his record.

67
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,090
Yeah.

68
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:34,080
I’d like to know too

69
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,340
how long he stays around if I don’t agree to sleep with him.

70
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,330
Will he still want to be with me?

71
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,320
Don’t worry, guys.

72
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,840
I will not be anyone’s prey.

73
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,650
That’s my friend.

74
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,400
Awesome.

75
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,450
Ray.

76
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,380
Back to carrying a flask?

77
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,310
You’re addicted.

78
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,630
Just for small sipping.

79
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,650
To get myself freshen up.

80
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:16,940
Right.

81
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,920
I can’t stop you anyway.

82
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,220
Just easy on that, alright?

83
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:24,110
I can’t be your emergency staff all the time.

84
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:26,000
Okay.

85
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:27,690
Don’t worry about me.

86
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:29,770
You have a boyfriend now.

87
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,280
Worry about him.

88
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,310
Ray.

89
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,610
Seriously.

90
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,880
Do you have a problem with Top?

91
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,760
You don’t seem to like him very much.

92
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,290
I’m just worried about you.

93
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,190
I think it’s too fast.

94
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,700
I don’t want you to hurry just because you want to have a relationship.

95
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,380
Someone nice might step into your life one day.

96
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:03,770
With that being said,

97
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,080
do you really like him?

98
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:11,420
I don’t know.

99
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:18,860
He's the first one I've ever been with who can make my heart tremble.

100
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:26,360
Good.

101
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,070
But note this.

102
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:34,120
If he hurts you, I’ll punch him until he looks ugly.

103
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:36,680
Alright.

104
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:42,350
I love you so much, my friend.

105
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,050
Um.

106
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,880
Thanks so much.

107
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,120
Mew. Ray.

108
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,270
I gave the contractor the design brief to your liking.

109
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,180
They will take it from here.

110
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,800
You can trust that they will never leave before the work is done.

111
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,820
I guarantee.

112
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,220
Okay.

113
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,320
Thanks a lot.

114
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:13,850
You’re welcome.

115
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,520
I’m happy to help.

116
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,320
Alright then. I’m taking off.

117
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:19,680
Call me if you need anything.

118
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,490
Cheum is with her girlfriend.

119
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,840
Ton is nowhere to be found, as always.

120
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,130
And you?

121
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:27,480
Where are you going?

122
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,600
I’m taking Mew out on a date.

123
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,660
Shall we?

124
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,350
Let’s go.

125
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:01,540
Hey, Sand.

126
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,360
Nick.

127
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,040
Long time no see.

128
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:05,630
I’ve been working a lot.

129
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,480
From university straight to the bar.

130
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,980
By the time I’m done singing, it’s already late.

131
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:09,560
Where are you headed?

132
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,220
To meet a friend.

133
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,150
We should hang out in my room sometimes.

134
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,440
I’ll get you some good stuff.

135
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:18,680
But you might need to hurry in case I have to move out first.

136
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,460
Why?

137
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,320
Where are you going?

138
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,360
My roommate moved out.

139
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,690
I need to find a new one otherwise I can’t cover the rent.

140
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,770
Hey!

141
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:26,970
Really?

142
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:27,770
I’m interested.

143
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:31,830
What about your old room?

144
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,820
It’s small. I want out anyway.

145
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,770
And this place doesn’t have rooms available.

146
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:37,990
You serious?

147
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,030
I am.

148
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,050
Do you have any problem?

149
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,090
Do you bring people over often?

150
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,120
Well, sometimes.

151
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,070
Not very often.

152
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:47,970
But I do, all the time.

153
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:48,900
And it’s loud.

154
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:49,870
Can you sleep like that?

155
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,400
Really?

156
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,560
I’m joking, you jackass.

157
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:58,060
If you’re to be my roommate, be careful who you bring over.

158
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,720
Just don’t mess up the room.

159
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,190
I’m ready to move.

160
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,800
Done.

161
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,450
[Yok Pok Ying Laser Games]

162
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,880
You took me to a laser game.

163
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:24,020
You want to kill me before we even start?

164
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,850
No.

165
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,360
I just tricked you to go on a date in a dark place.

166
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,630
So that we can do things more conveniently.

167
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:36,440
Do what?

168
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,190
You said you could wait.

169
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:39,750
Well, I don’t know.

170
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:44,600
Whenever I take aim, I never miss.

171
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,530
Try me.

172
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:53,260
Be sure your attack is good

173
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,050
or you will face my counterattack.

174
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:13,120
You always make it publicly known when you ask someone to be your lover?

175
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,470
I only do it with someone I really like.

176
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:24,360
Don’t you think it’s a little too fast?

177
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,410
No.

178
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,520
Why would we waste our time talking?

179
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,100
When you take your aim, you go for it.

180
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,300
Weren’t you afraid I’d reject you?

181
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:43,030
Top.

182
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,120
Top.

183
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,280
Top.

184
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:55,890
Top.

185
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,410
Top.

186
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,930
I had the gut to ask you

187
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,550
because I knew you share the feelings too.

188
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,050
Top.

189
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,810
Honestly, I was embarrassed that night

190
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,690
when you did it in front of everyone.

191
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:39,540
I’m sorry.

192
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,440
I was impulsive.

193
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,970
I just did what I wanted.

194
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,870
What if I told you that I agreed just because

195
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,290
I wanted to save your face?

196
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:03,630
You may think you’re hot, rich,

197
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,880
and get whatever you want.

198
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:10,190
But honestly, you’re not entirely my type.

199
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,020
What’s your type then?

200
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,560
Many traits.

201
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,000
I don’t know if you will tick all my checklist boxes.

202
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:25,490
Just tell me.

203
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,920
I’m sure I tick all of it.

204
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:30,840
Look at you being so confident.

205
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:32,890
I am.

206
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:36,580
Then…

207
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,330
Can you start over and hit on me again?

208
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,490
No problem.

209
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,130
I’m not easy.

210
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,990
I like something difficult.

211
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,070
But I think I figured out your weakness now.

212
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,280
What?

213
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,040
Me.

214
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:47,280
My type is pretty simple.

215
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,990
I’m not a picky kind of guy.

216
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,130
First, he must respect me.

217
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:55,940
He must love my friends

218
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,310
and get along with them.

219
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,670
Most importantly, he must not keep secrets from me.

220
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:02,700
He must not lie to me.

221
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,490
That’s it.

222
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:45,710
Running your business inside university walls

223
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,470
is against the rules, Mr. Singer.

224
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,850
You again?

225
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,620
Who do you think you are, following me around?

226
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:56,660
I saw you selling stuff to a junior in my faculty.

227
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,320
That’s pretty challenging.

228
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,090
Aren’t you afraid of getting caught?

229
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,900
None of you f*cking business.

230
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:04,680
Whatever I’m selling doesn’t concern you.

231
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:09,160
And don’t even claim you’re a good man and want this university to be free of alcohol and drugs.

232
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,110
A drunkard like you isn’t a threat to me.

233
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,980
Hi, Sand.

234
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,460
Come on in.

235
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,270
See you later.

236
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:59,360
You got eyebrow tattoos?

237
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,610
A little.

238
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:01,600
It’s trendy.

239
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,470
People keep asking me what I do.

240
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,380
Hold on.

241
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,840
Are you 20 yet?

242
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,120
May I see your national ID card?

243
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:18,640
Oops. Two years above 20.

244
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,510
Okay then.

245
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:22,250
Sorry. My club is pretty strict.

246
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:25,640
If there’s someone under 20 found here, the cop will come and shut this club down.

247
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,320
Thank you.

248
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,170
Wait…

249
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:29,350
Welcome, young man.

250
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:48,630
What are you looking for?

251
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:49,910
Nothing.

252
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:52,290
Looking for me?

253
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:54,470
No, I’m just here to chill out.

254
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,050
Your first time here?

255
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:57,730
It is.

256
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:01,800
I really like newcomers.

257
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,360
Let me take care of you tonight.

258
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:06,610
- That’s fine.
- Sit down.

259
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,160
Nan, come here.

260
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,490
Keep him entertained.

261
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,150
What’s your name?

262
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:19,400
It’s Ray.

263
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:28,470
You have a lover yet?

264
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,870
You like that, don't you?

265
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:41,160
Look at you smiling.

266
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,390
Sorry, guys.

267
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:43,380
I need to go.

268
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,560
- Where are you going?
- Excuse me.

269
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,620
Wait.

270
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,880
I’m sorry.

271
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:52,580
I haven’t shown him my best move yet.

272
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:57,940
Why the hell did you follow me here?

273
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,840
I want to know why you’re here.

274
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,510
Are you a drug dealer?

275
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,460
In university and this agogo bar.

276
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,230
You’re really something.

277
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,600
Who are you?

278
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:13,560
Pablo Escobar?

279
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,500
Whatever shit I’m selling is my business.

280
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:19,910
Don’t you have friends to hang out with?

281
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:21,190
Why keep tracking me?

282
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,270
Hey!

283
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,740
F*ck! My stuff!

284
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,550
Damn it.

285
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:37,850
You’re selling booze?

286
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:40,160
Hell yeah, plum wine.

287
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:44,240
Who would have known?

288
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:46,070
I thought you were a drug seller.

289
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,660
You’ve been acting suspiciously.

290
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,270
It’s not legal, is it?

291
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,500
I can’t just sell it openly.

292
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,280
That’s why I’m doing it in secret.

293
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:55,020
Poor you.

294
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:57,720
Isn’t being a singer enough for you?

295
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,270
You’re a moonshiner too?

296
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:00,300
Yes.

297
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:02,000
I’m not as loaded as you are.

298
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:05,030
Whatever earns me money, I do it all.

299
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,730
But first,

300
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:09,030
compensate for these broken bottles.

301
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:11,590
Sure.

302
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,070
How much?

303
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,230
5,000 baht.

304
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,090
Give me your QR code.

305
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,350
Come on.

306
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:36,770
You just said you do whatever makes you money.

307
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,160
Yes.

308
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:40,250
So?

309
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,520
Can I hire you to be my drinking buddy?

310
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,960
If you want an entertainer, go back to the agogo bar.

311
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,820
No.

312
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:53,720
I wanna drink with you.

313
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:56,320
We can drink your plum wine.

314
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:59,640
I might like it and become your regular customer.

315
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,130
How does that sound?

316
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:08,890
I just want a drinking buddy.

317
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,380
Are you scared of me?

318
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,340
I am so not.

319
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:16,440
Then come with me.

320
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:18,360
I’ll pay you 7,000 baht.

321
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,530
It’s so good to be rich.

322
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,820
You just throw your money at whatever you want.

323
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,300
Can I throw it at you now?

324
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:31,540
8,000.

325
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:37,820
10,000.

326
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,300
What the hell are you waiting for? Lead the way.

327
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,170
Pay right after we get there.

328
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:49,950
Yeah.

329
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,310
Whoa.

330
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,490
Keep this pose on.

331
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:09,770
Let me take your photo.

332
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:11,110
I’ll just use up the remaining film roll.

333
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,060
Wait.

334
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:14,210
Can you not do it?

335
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:16,210
I don’t like my pictures taken. I don’t look good in them.

336
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,830
That’s because your photographer isn’t skilled enough.

337
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:21,650
You will look good. Trust me, dude.

338
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,290
Wow. What a friendly language to use.

339
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,000
We f*cked. No need to speak with manners.

340
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:28,380
What do you want?

341
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,450
If you don’t want pictures, you can just go.

342
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:32,680
Fine.

343
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,120
Let’s take a photo.

344
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,010
But…

345
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,620
you must let me see it first.

346
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:40,200
And don’t show it to anyone.

347
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,400
Alright.

348
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:45,760
I don’t take everyone’s photos.

349
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:50,240
I only do it with my favorite.

350
00:22:57,450 --> 00:22:58,320
Come on.

351
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:01,810
Two, three.

352
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,180
Wow! This is cool.

353
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:15,920
You have a dark room in your house.

354
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:20,200
You like photography. Why did you enroll in Business Administration?

355
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,250
I followed my dad’s advice.

356
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,520
I might need to take on his business after graduation.

357
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,360
But in my third year, I took a photography class.

358
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:30,970
Surprisingly, I liked it.

359
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,740
So I’m leaning towards it as my profession.

360
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:35,770
I see.

361
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:36,670
You’re rich.

362
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,230
You don’t care much about things.

363
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:39,410
What about you?

364
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:41,870
You’re a graphic design student.

365
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,960
Why do you have a phone repair and IT gadget shop?

366
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:47,170
Just like you.

367
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,370
It’s a family business.

368
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:51,530
I prefer animation making.

369
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:53,610
I’m doing my internship and collecting my portfolio right now.

370
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:54,370
Look.

371
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,720
We got it.

372
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,410
See?

373
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:59,250
I told you I took great photos.

374
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:00,900
I’ve got skills.

375
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:03,500
Okay.

376
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:05,920
I can’t help it. I don’t like to be in photos.

377
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,560
As a kid, I had curly hair.

378
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,540
People called me “Kim’s son, the kinky head.”

379
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:11,370
My hair was curly like shredded pork.

380
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:14,740
I worked hard on the makeover to get this look.

381
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,830
Well, you’re cute now.

382
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,670
Be confident.

383
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:24,650
I wouldn't go for a second time if you weren't cute.

384
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:35,810
Should I be glad?

385
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,880
I should take it as an honor, shouldn’t I?

386
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:39,840
Right.

387
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:44,920
You should be glad to be my favorite.

388
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,580
I’m gonna develop my film now.

389
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,280
Yeah, go on.

390
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,510
Hey.

391
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:11,550
It’s actually not bad.

392
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,130
But you might need more time.

393
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:18,280
Yeah.

394
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:20,520
People of good taste like you wouldn’t like what I like.

395
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,550
Come here.

396
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:08,510
You listen to Micro?

397
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,100
It’s not like you at all.

398
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,660
That’s my mom’s.

399
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:17,270
It’s mine now since she’s passed.

400
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:28,710
I actually like the 80’s - 90’s music too.

401
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:29,990
City Pop, that sort of thing.

402
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:32,470
To name one band these days, it should be Polycat.

403
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,680
I like Polycat too.

404
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:36,150
Have you seen them playing live?

405
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:37,290
Superb.

406
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:46,810
I’m sorry to hear about your mom.

407
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,860
When did she pass?

408
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,010
A long time ago.

409
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:00,500
I was in high school.

410
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,730
How did she die?

411
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:16,030
Ma’am.

412
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:17,130
What happened?

413
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,610
Help!

414
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:24,620
Ma’am!

415
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:37,060
It’s okay if you don’t want to answer that.

416
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:38,980
I’m sorry.

417
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:40,410
I’m being nosy.

418
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:45,850
At least she left you with good taste.

419
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:48,640
You should thank her for introducing you to Nui Amphol.

420
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,080
- Give me your right arm.
- What are you doing?

421
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:55,150
Right arm.

422
00:28:55,660 --> 00:29:00,530
♪ Take it, Take it, Take all my heart ♪

423
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,210
Or you like it more low-pitched?

424
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:03,720
What the heck?

425
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,570
Stop.

426
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,560
Let’s just put some music on.

427
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,910
What now?

428
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:42,250
Do I need to call you Sugar Daddy too?

429
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:43,450
Not my style.

430
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,620
No, you dipshit.

431
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,390
Just drink and enjoy the music with me.

432
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,000
I just don’t want to be alone.

433
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:53,650
Sure.

434
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:56,190
I like easy jobs that pay big.

435
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,610
That’s nice, Top.

436
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,360
Mew.

437
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:48,210
Your boyfriend is freakin’ cool.

438
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,010
He isn’t my boyfriend.

439
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:03,840
Mew, well done.

440
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,160
Awesome.

441
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:19,670
Great job, April.

442
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:22,860
You’re great, April.

443
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,520
Awesome!

444
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,810
I’ll take you here every day.

445
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:28,680
Let’s do this.

446
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,380
You got it.

447
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,410
You got this.

448
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:34,050
Let’s go.

449
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:39,520
Cheum!

450
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:41,810
Why did you let go?

451
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:45,100
Cheum! Why did you let go?

452
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:48,920
Guys, my leg hurts.

453
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:49,660
Help.

454
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:52,220
Guard.

455
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:53,420
Cheum, you alright?

456
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:54,550
Cheum.

457
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:07,800
Are you alright?

458
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,080
Does it hurt, baby?

459
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,080
You okay?

460
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,810
Not so much.

461
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,070
It hurts a little.

462
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:15,960
I guess I sprained it right after the start.

463
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:17,370
It’s swollen.

464
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:18,130
Let me see.

465
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,360
Ouch!

466
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,680
Ray, what the heck are you doing?

467
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,040
I’m sorry.

468
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,060
You even know how to do it?

469
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:27,050
Ton, go get an icepack.

470
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,240
Stay still.

471
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:31,600
It’s okay, Top.

472
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,600
It’s just a sprained ankle.

473
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:36,500
Let’s try the icepack first.

474
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,500
If it doesn’t get better, we can go see a doctor.

475
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:40,070
Be still.

476
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,280
I got it.

477
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,340
You’re okay.

478
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,390
You’ll get better.

479
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,210
Does it hurt?

480
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:52,120
Hold my hand.

481
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,580
[He loves my friends and gets along well with them.]

482
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,730
Your boyfriend is just great.

483
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,760
He’s got good taste and is good at sports.

484
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:12,280
Today, he’s a doctor.

485
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:13,940
He’s not my boyfriend.

486
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,970
I asked him for a restart.

487
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:17,280
Let him hit on me again.

488
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:19,390
I have my own checklist.

489
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:21,240
He got my first tick though.

490
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:22,400
He gets along well with my friends.

491
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:24,820
That’s nice.

492
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:28,530
It's a blessing to have a lover who gets along with your friends.

493
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:31,570
That way, you feel comfortable when hanging out together.

494
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,870
Just like April who gets along with everyone.

495
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:36,030
How cute.

496
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:38,250
Yuck!

497
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:39,850
Stop talking.

498
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:08,490
Ton.

499
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:09,700
What the hell are you doing?

500
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:12,460
Why don’t you get naked in the shower?

501
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:14,030
Are you that shameless?

502
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:15,490
No need to be ashamed.

503
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:17,000
It’s just you in here.

504
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,460
Besides, we saw each other naked before, right?

505
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:22,600
At least I beat Mew at this.

506
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:24,680
I saw every part of your body.

507
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:26,810
But he hasn’t.

508
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,530
What do you want?

509
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:35,910
I want it again.

510
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,590
Do you remember our time in that photo booth?

511
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:54,140
I still can’t forget about it.

512
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:04,380
I can do it as you like this time.

513
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:16,190
Stop complimenting me.

514
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:18,020
Yuck!

515
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:19,650
Let’s eat.

516
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:20,390
Shall we?

517
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:21,230
Yeah.

518
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:22,300
You guys go ahead.

519
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,640
I’ll go get Top and Ton.

520
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:27,410
You want to take a shower with Top, don’t you?

521
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,330
Yeah?

522
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:29,450
No.

523
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:30,810
I’m not like that.

524
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:33,140
Ray, should we go change?

525
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,530
You go ahead.

526
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,040
I just want to chill out here first.

527
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:39,060
Okay.

528
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:39,780
See you.

529
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,600
Make it quick.

530
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,350
Alright.

531
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:43,060
Don’t take so long.

532
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:53,940
Ton, stop.

533
00:35:57,330 --> 00:36:01,810
You know no one can beat me at this kind of thing.

534
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:07,990
Top.

535
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,450
Top.

536
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:20,210
Top.

537
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:24,040
Top.

538
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,940
You’ve been in here forever.

539
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,610
You haven’t done taking a shower yet?

540
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,190
I usually take a long shower.

541
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:37,750
Where is Ton?

542
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:39,480
Ah.

543
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,150
He probably left.

544
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:43,910
I’m gonna take a shower then.

545
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,370
Shower with me?

546
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,800
No. I’m shy.

547
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:55,800
What are you being shy for?

548
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,480
You’ve seen me like this before.

549
00:36:58,870 --> 00:36:59,480
Come on.

550
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:37,430
Assembling a table isn’t easy.

551
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,980
My four years of education don’t help.

552
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,670
You volunteered yourself.

553
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:47,160
I told you to let them assemble it for us.

554
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,510
Well, I assemble this table for you

555
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:53,160
so that you can think of me when you look at it.

556
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:58,090
Here.

557
00:38:01,290 --> 00:38:02,130
Feed me.

558
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:04,540
No.

559
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:05,880
Feed yourself.

560
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,390
Come on.

561
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:09,630
I’ve been doing this for so long that my arms are tired. Can’t you see?

562
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,340
Please.

563
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:12,650
Feed me.

564
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:26,670
How about I feed you like this?

565
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:30,150
If you want it, get it.

566
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:39,450
Challenging me?

567
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:18,040
It’s a reward for assembling the table for me.

568
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,210
You’re sassy.

569
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:23,400
Hey!

570
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:26,070
You can’t do that.

571
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:27,800
You’re not allowed yet.

572
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,760
I told you. You must hit on me again.

573
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,550
Okay. I’m sorry.

574
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:35,970
I will ask you first next time.

575
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,370
It’s late.

576
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,670
When will you be leaving?

577
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:45,820
This table assembly wore me out.

578
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,490
And we played wakeboard before this.

579
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:49,820
I’m too tired to drive.

580
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,680
Can I spend the night here?

581
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:57,880
Fine.

582
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,530
But you take the couch.

583
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,310
We cuddled all night before.

584
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,370
I didn’t go out of line.

585
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:07,350
Don’t you trust me?

586
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,630
I’ll say it again. This is a reset.

587
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:11,750
It’s your first sleepover at my place.

588
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:14,060
And we’re not a thing.

589
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:20,510
Wait a minute.

590
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:24,170
But you just kissed me.

591
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:26,030
You started it.

592
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:27,210
That doesn’t count.

593
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:32,460
I was rewarding you for the table assembly.

594
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:35,440
So are you crashing here or not?

595
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:39,630
Okay.

596
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,820
Bring me a blanket.

597
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:43,900
I get cold easily.

598
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:46,850
Sure.

599
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:17,050
Hey.

600
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:19,270
Huh?

601
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:22,260
We’ve slept together many times.

602
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:23,420
Right?

603
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,040
Is that so?

604
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:26,830
I never count.

605
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:30,710
So what is this?

606
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:33,860
What are we to each other?

607
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,630
What do you want to be?

608
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,630
A f*ck buddy…

609
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:41,080
or a friend with benefits?

610
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:44,880
How are they different?

611
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:49,790
F*ck buddies don’t care what the other does.

612
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:52,020
If they want it, they just make a call.

613
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:55,350
Friends with benefits are more friendly.

614
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,950
They do more than just sleep together.

615
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:58,120
They have things in common.

616
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,950
Watch movies and eat together sometimes.

617
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,900
And what am I to you?

618
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,310
What is the matter with you?

619
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:16,570
Don’t tell me you’re into this already.

620
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:18,420
If so, I’ll stop.

621
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:20,460
I hate dramas.

622
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:24,720
I’m not being dramatic.

623
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:27,460
I asked out of curiosity.

624
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:30,580
Besides, I don’t feel that much about you.

625
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:40,660
Fine.

626
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:42,470
I’m your f*ck buddy.

627
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:44,950
We only hook up in the room.

628
00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:46,220
Barely know each other.

629
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:47,830
There, there.

630
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:49,900
Are you upset?

631
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:51,680
Alright.

632
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:54,870
We can hang out sometimes.

633
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,320
My life isn’t just about sex.

634
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:00,210
Let’s push our status just a bit further.

635
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:02,740
Okay, kinky head?

636
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:05,800
Kinky head, my ass.

637
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:06,970
My hair isn’t kinky anymore.

638
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:34,990
How do you get home?

639
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:37,830
No idea.

640
00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:38,960
But I don’t want to go home yet.

641
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:41,850
Should we go somewhere else?

642
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:44,380
Do you want to check out the plant at my place?

643
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:45,980
I just bought a new Monstera.

644
00:43:47,330 --> 00:43:49,190
That’s the new pickup line now?

645
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:50,960
Well, I don’t have cats.

646
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:54,100
Can we check out a plant instead?

647
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:55,630
Sand.

648
00:43:58,760 --> 00:43:59,630
Where are you going?

649
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:04,130
Someplace with a friend.

650
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:06,060
A friend?

651
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:07,570
What’s her name?

652
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:08,760
Have you known each other for long?

653
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:13,630
This is Amm.

654
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:14,710
We just knew each other.

655
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:15,790
What’s your deal?

656
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:17,890
Amm,

657
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:19,830
I’m Ray.

658
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,080
Hi. What’s up?

659
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,160
Are you two continuing at Sand’s?

660
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:26,370
Come to my place instead.

661
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:29,320
I have unlimited alcohol.

662
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:30,990
We can put on some music.

663
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,050
You can swim too if you want.

664
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,830
You have a pool?

665
00:44:34,830 --> 00:44:35,640
Yeah.

666
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:36,880
We can swim together.

667
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:39,780
You, Sand, and me.

668
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:42,780
Hm?

669
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:45,610
What the hell are you doing?

670
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,920
Are you suggesting a threesome?

671
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:49,410
Leave me out of it.

672
00:44:49,410 --> 00:44:50,070
Come on.

673
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:52,130
Don’t you want to party?

674
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:53,840
You can do so at my house.

675
00:44:54,430 --> 00:44:55,210
Or what?

676
00:44:55,870 --> 00:44:57,170
Do I need to pay?

677
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:58,830
I’ll give you 20,000.

678
00:44:59,030 --> 00:44:59,740
What do you say?

679
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:01,960
Don’t.

680
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:03,780
Last time you were drunk and blacked out.

681
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:05,250
You didn’t even know I left.

682
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:08,010
This time I promise I won’t sleep.

683
00:45:08,270 --> 00:45:09,390
You’re fun to talk to.

684
00:45:10,070 --> 00:45:10,950
Please.

685
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,190
Please, Sand.

686
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:18,010
Please.

687
00:45:18,830 --> 00:45:19,390
Please.

688
00:45:19,390 --> 00:45:20,920
You’re such a pesterer.

689
00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:27,290
Amm, my friend over there is drunk.

690
00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:28,460
I need to take care of him.

691
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:29,370
Sorry for tonight.

692
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:30,990
What the hell.

693
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:32,410
I should’ve just left with someone else.

694
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,630
Instead of going home with a girl,

695
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:01,380
here I am driving a drunk man.

696
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:04,210
I’m not drunk.

697
00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:05,770
I’m just too lazy to drive.

698
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:07,230
That’s why I asked you to drive.

699
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,360
Next time, if you need a driver, hire a driver.

700
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,600
Not spoil my date.

701
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:14,930
Why?

702
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:17,740
Are you horny tonight?

703
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:19,270
Huh?

704
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:21,070
Horny?

705
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:25,030
Ray, what the hell?

706
00:46:25,030 --> 00:46:26,300
You want us to die?

707
00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:36,430
You’re a bar singer.

708
00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:38,310
Do you have a one-night stand very often?

709
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:41,730
That’s normal, right?

710
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,160
I’m not ugly.

711
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:44,920
I’m pretty charming.

712
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:46,850
A man with confidence.

713
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:48,190
Yes.

714
00:46:48,190 --> 00:46:49,480
I know I’m hot.I know I’m hot.

715
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:50,540
I don’t need to be humble.

716
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:59,020
Do you think I’m hot?

717
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:04,820
No.

718
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:05,840
You’re pretty plain.

719
00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:07,030
Asshole.

720
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,210
Hey! We can die right here.

721
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:16,270
♪ I better not ♪

722
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:19,120
♪ Just forget it ♪

723
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:21,880
♪ I should forget it ♪

724
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:27,720
♪ Keep telling myself that I should not ♪

725
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:30,560
♪ Just forget it ♪

726
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:49,530
Top.

727
00:48:52,580 --> 00:48:53,460
What’s wrong?

728
00:48:54,530 --> 00:48:55,430
Are you sick?

729
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:58,630
Ah.

730
00:49:00,830 --> 00:49:01,510
No.

731
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:03,610
I just can’t sleep.

732
00:49:03,770 --> 00:49:04,820
That’s why I’m taking the pills.

733
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:08,760
I’m sorry.

734
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,370
My couch isn’t comfortable, is it?

735
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:15,180
It’s not that.

736
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:18,190
It’s been my issue for so long.

737
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:28,970
Why?

738
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:31,290
You can talk to me.

739
00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:43,300
I have insomnia.

740
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:45,770
I can’t sleep alone.

741
00:49:49,870 --> 00:49:51,210
You can’t sleep alone?

742
00:49:53,350 --> 00:49:54,300
What joke are you pulling now?

743
00:50:00,550 --> 00:50:01,600
When I was young,

744
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:06,680
I was left home alone as my parents were out at a social event.

745
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:09,850
There was a fire that night.

746
00:50:11,730 --> 00:50:13,610
I woke up and saw the smoke all over the place.

747
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:21,370
After that, I haven’t been able to sleep by myself.

748
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:25,690
My head always thinks something bad will happen while I’m sleeping.

749
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:27,750
And I’ll die alone.

750
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:41,160
Are you telling the truth?

751
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:49,820
I’m sorry.

752
00:50:50,990 --> 00:50:54,020
Have you seen a doctor?

753
00:50:56,690 --> 00:50:57,370
I have.

754
00:51:00,830 --> 00:51:01,460
Look.

755
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:03,820
I’m okay.

756
00:51:04,390 --> 00:51:05,490
I can sleep.

757
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:07,800
Don’t worry.

758
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:21,710
If I lie down next to you, will you be able to sleep?

759
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:27,920
I should fall asleep more easily.

760
00:51:58,830 --> 00:51:59,860
Just hug.

761
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:02,190
No more than that.

762
00:52:05,050 --> 00:52:06,650
Hugging you is enough to make me fall asleep.

763
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:21,640
[He respects me.]

764
00:53:06,370 --> 00:53:07,150
Thanks.

765
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:16,470
Where are your friends though?

766
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:18,570
The ones who always show up at Yo’s bar.

767
00:53:19,010 --> 00:53:20,520
What’s that guy with the specs’ name?

768
00:53:21,210 --> 00:53:22,170
Mew.

769
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:25,740
He has a boyfriend now.

770
00:53:25,930 --> 00:53:27,040
He’s probably with him.

771
00:53:29,970 --> 00:53:30,930
Now I know.

772
00:53:31,450 --> 00:53:33,450
You’re a lonely spoiled rich brat.

773
00:53:33,770 --> 00:53:36,330
Your friends left you because they have lovers.

774
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:37,950
That’s why you need a new friend.

775
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:39,990
Your life is dramatic. Poor you.

776
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:41,050
What a dick.

777
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:48,060
I can be your friend.

778
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:49,410
You don’t have to hire me.

779
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:54,140
My friend?

780
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:56,350
Um.

781
00:53:56,910 --> 00:53:59,770
If you're my friend, you have to look after me in every way.

782
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:01,050
Jackass.

783
00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:03,090
That sounds more like a father than a friend.

784
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,120
That girl at the bar was cute.

785
00:54:26,330 --> 00:54:27,410
Is she your type?

786
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,250
I don’t have a type.

787
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:33,600
Different people have different appearances.

788
00:54:34,190 --> 00:54:36,400
If that person and I hit it off, we go on.

789
00:54:41,770 --> 00:54:43,530
Have you ever been hit on by a guy?

790
00:54:49,270 --> 00:54:50,070
Of course.

791
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:51,810
Been hit on by people of all genders.

792
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:52,920
I’m open.

793
00:54:53,810 --> 00:54:55,950
I more focus on the individual’s personality.

794
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,200
If we click,

795
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:00,500
I’m ready to open up.

796
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:40,920
Why are you asking though?

797
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:43,570
What do you want me to do now?

798
00:55:43,930 --> 00:55:45,930
Last time I was hired to be your drinking buddy.

799
00:55:45,930 --> 00:55:47,300
What is it this time? A hooker?

800
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:52,160
Fine by me.

801
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:56,150
Should I hire you?

802
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:02,380
Dickhead.

803
00:56:04,510 --> 00:56:06,680
Save your money to hire someone who wants it.

804
00:56:08,070 --> 00:56:12,410
As for me, if I’m interested, I do it for free.

805
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:13,220
No money involved.

806
00:56:21,710 --> 00:56:22,760
What about me?

807
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:23,760
Interesting enough to make you interested?

808
00:56:30,570 --> 00:56:31,760
You said you’re open.

809
00:56:33,070 --> 00:56:34,350
Open enough for someone like me?

810
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:03,110
If you go on,

811
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:06,520
it won’t be just friends anymore.

812
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:14,090
Some kind of friendship can start from having sex.

813
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:17,270
Sure.

814
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:24,360
And you’re gonna keep wanting me.

815
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:27,040
But we’re just friends no matter what.

816
00:58:10,790 --> 00:58:12,180
It’s all fine.

817
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:14,650
Friends can have sex.

818
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:17,130
A heart and something down there

819
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:19,780
have different duties.

820
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:23,560
Yes, it’s possible.

821
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,560
But you need to be careful.

822
00:58:26,330 --> 00:58:27,910
Don’t feel more than that.

823
00:58:30,390 --> 00:58:32,930
It’s like playing with fire.

824
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:55,410
Directed by Pinya Chookamsri & Tichakorn Phukhaotong

825
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:58,260
Guys, I’ll throw a pool party.

826
00:58:58,300 --> 00:58:59,850
Can you help me set it up?

827
00:59:01,370 --> 00:59:05,080
You can name our relationship whatever you like.

828
00:59:05,830 --> 00:59:08,130
I’ve never slept with anyone who’s not my lover more than once.

829
00:59:08,130 --> 00:59:10,370
Can’t you just make an exception for me?

830
00:59:10,370 --> 00:59:11,300
Who hired this band?

831
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:11,850
Me.

832
00:59:11,850 --> 00:59:12,480
Do you have a problem?

833
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:15,970
I bet you can tell Mew and Ray aren’t just friends.

834
00:59:16,090 --> 00:59:17,260
Come on. Let’s go.

835
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:24,100
I have more.
