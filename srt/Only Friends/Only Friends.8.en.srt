1
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:07,630
I’m sorry about Mew.

2
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:08,870
Don’t apologize.

3
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:09,990
It’s not your fault.

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:11,680
Nobody was supposed to know about the thing between me and Top.

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,440
But you, stalker, ruined my life.

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,730
Don’t you ever get close to me again.

7
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:15,870
I never love you.

8
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:18,650
How about we find a way to make him pay?

9
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:19,940
Actually, there is one thing.

10
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:22,080
Boston hooked up with someone and that guy recorded his video.

11
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,020
How did you get the video?

12
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,270
For the sake of our friendship.

13
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:28,410
When you hooked up with Top, did you think of our friendship?

14
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,500
I just wanna know what I must do to get a chance from you.

15
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,870
Why does the word love from you hurt me so damn much?

16
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:34,510
I will make you fall in love with me again.

17
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:37,990
Perhaps, the one I should love is you.

18
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,190
Cheum.

19
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,360
Are you okay?

20
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:18,650
This is not right.

21
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:20,470
I must do something.

22
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:21,460
Wait.

23
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:22,620
What are you doing?

24
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,170
Warn him.

25
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:26,070
To stop this behavior.

26
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:29,220
Ever since he’s with Ray, he’s been drinking every day.

27
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,810
He skips classes. He doesn’t take my calls.

28
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,930
He doesn’t listen to my freakin’ warning.

29
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,450
A good boy has turned into a shitty one.

30
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:37,350
But you can’t do that.

31
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:38,770
No.

32
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,210
Why can’t I?

33
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:43,880
I’m his friend.

34
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,190
You are but you don’t own his life.

35
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:48,710
Calm down.

36
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,840
I know you’re worried about Mew.

37
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:52,680
But he’s a grown man.

38
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:55,270
He can take care of his life.

39
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:59,170
Someone like Mew will walk back to you after he's had enough.

40
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:00,330
You just wait for him here.

41
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,340
I’ll keep you company.

42
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:02,680
Let’s eat.

43
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:05,590
Well?

44
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,710
Anyone who has you as a friend is so lucky.

45
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:19,030
But I’m luckier to have you as my girlfriend.

46
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:21,000
Yeah?

47
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:22,910
You’re doing great. Calm down.

48
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:24,970
You’re great.

Directed by Pinya Chookamsri & Tichakorn Phukhaotong

50
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,430
Can I borrow a lighter?

51
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:53,890
Why don’t you just quit smoking

52
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,810
if you're not going to carry a lighter?

53
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,370
It’s my excuse to talk to people.

54
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:18,650
How’s your arm?

55
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,300
Good?

56
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:22,230
It’s all good.

57
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,380
But I’m going to court tomorrow.

58
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,660
I have no idea what I’ll get.

59
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,140
Serves you right.

60
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,920
Drunk driving is wrong.

61
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:32,650
Even though you didn’t hit anyone.

62
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:33,850
I know.

63
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:35,250
Why do you need to repeat it?

64
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:36,780
I’m guilty, alright?

65
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,110
So what’s going on with you and Mew?

66
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:47,560
I heard he broke up with Top.

67
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,660
Congrats.

68
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,670
You’re no longer in the friend zone.

69
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,270
Good.

70
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:03,090
But we need to see if it’s gonna work.

71
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,810
At least he let me cross that friend zone line.

72
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:09,300
It’s okay.

73
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:11,640
Good.

74
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,280
You can finally end the secret crush.

75
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:17,450
Such a waste of time, right?

76
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:23,720
Are you okay?

77
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:28,200
Why wouldn’t I be?

78
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:31,290
You’re seeing someone you’ve always loved.

79
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:32,860
It’s a dream come true.

80
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:41,910
Can we still be friends?

81
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,240
Friends?

82
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,810
You and I have never been friends from the get-go.

83
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,230
We have nothing in common.

84
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,440
Besides,

85
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,930
I don’t know why I should be friends with you.

86
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:10,690
But when I’m with you, I’m so damn happy.

87
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:17,090
You will be happy too when you spend time with Mew.

88
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,070
What you did with me, you will get to do it with him.

89
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:27,580
You might even be happier.

90
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,060
Sand.

91
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,480
Let me go already.

92
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,040
What the hell is wrong with you?

93
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:56,750
What exactly do you want?

94
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:02,880
You’re the one that hit on me.

95
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:08,470
Plug.

96
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:09,920
Yo.

97
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:12,750
What’s the matter?

98
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:15,380
Nothing.

99
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:16,670
You guys can leave us.

100
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,110
Stay, Sand.

101
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:25,370
Help me figure out what the hell your big sis wants.

102
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:30,810
You know she flirted with me for a month?

103
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,570
I refused. Time after time.

104
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,590
But now I want to get serious.

105
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,450
I wanna move in with her.

106
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:39,980
She said she didn’t want it anymore.

107
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,050
What does that mean?

108
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:54,040
Do you think this is easy for me, Plug?

109
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:58,660
You think this is the first time I have to deal with this?

110
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,850
There were many people I gave all my heart to.

111
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,810
I gave them everything I got.

112
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,410
There were many people I gave my room key to.

113
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:14,720
They all returned it to me in the end.

114
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,500
I don't want you to raise my expectations.

115
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,240
And then you leave me too.

116
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:32,930
If you really think nobody in this world wants to get serious with you,

117
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,360
then you better stay alone.

118
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,050
You don’t need me.

119
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:55,330
Let’s just break up.

120
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:01,710
Plug.

121
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,320
Take it easy.

122
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:46,660
Here.

123
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,950
You told me not to smoke.

124
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,360
Why do you want it now?

125
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:59,330
I want to do something I’ve never done.

126
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:15,280
Hey.

127
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:17,620
This is quite nice.

128
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,850
I’ll bring you the new one next time.

129
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:56,740
Move.

130
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:58,640
What’s the hurry?

131
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,100
Can we just talk?

132
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,980
I’ve got nothing to talk to you about.

133
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,560
You’re smoking now?

134
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,730
How do you know?

135
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,340
I saw you smoking with Ray back there.

136
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:22,320
And you’re involved in this how?

137
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,830
I wanted to try.

138
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,010
It’s okay if you want to try.

139
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:29,220
But be careful. You might get addicted.

140
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,010
I’m worried.

141
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:32,970
Why?

142
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,370
It’s none of your business.

143
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:36,340
This is my life.

144
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,240
And I’m living a happy life.

145
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,150
Are you sure?

146
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:47,420
Are you really picking Ray?

147
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:49,730
What if I am?

148
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,570
What’s your problem?

149
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:54,520
Ray’s done nothing wrong.

150
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,070
At least he doesn’t lie to me.

151
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,100
And he truly loves me.

152
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:04,070
If he truly loved you, he wouldn’t have introduced you to the bad thing.

153
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:07,440
It’s just smoking. Is it that bad?

154
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,450
And tell me.

155
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:14,250
Should a person who truly loves me do the same as you did?

156
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:37,290
♪ Where could I move on to ♪

157
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:40,500
♪ My heart is set on you ♪

158
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,890
♪ How many times… ♪

159
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:44,570

160
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:51,330
♪ How many times I… ♪

161
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,420
Well, continue.

162
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,330
I need to go to work now.

163
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:02,030
Hold on.

164
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,720
Why didn’t you respond to my messages?

165
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:10,780
Hm?

166
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:16,200
I’ve been busy.

167
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:22,420
And I think, for something that’s not important, all I should do is read it.

168
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:32,350
You know?

169
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,410
I went to court.

170
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:38,250
They ordered me to do social work.

171
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,010
I have to choose what I will do.

172
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,780
Nursing home.

173
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:45,230
Street cleaning.

174
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,920
Or playing music for kids.

175
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:49,840
Sounds boring, right?

176
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,050
Yeah?

177
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,080
Wanna go with me?

178
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,940
No.

179
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,080
I wasn’t part of your crime.

180
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,250
Why should I go?

181
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:05,250
Come on. I just want some company.

182
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:07,980
Please come with me.

183
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,440
I think I’m gonna go with music for kids.

184
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,530
At least it’s not hot.

185
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,160
Better than street cleaning.

186
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:15,170
Right?

187
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,390
Can you even play musical instruments?

188
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:18,430
That’s the point. No.

189
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,150
But I can sing.

190
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:24,860
And you can play guitar for me.

191
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:26,410
Please.

192
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:30,700
No.

193
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,190
It’s not my business.

194
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:37,460
If you want someone to go with, ask Mew.

195
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:42,570
Mew can't play guitar.

196
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,270
Please come with me.

197
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:54,430
You're not only helping me but you are also helping those orphans.

198
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,640
They can enjoy your music for a few hours.

199
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:00,140
Please.

200
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:09,100
And I will tell those kids that you are the hottest singer at our University.

201
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,200
Please.

202
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,910
Please, please.

203
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:28,200
Tom Yum Soup with small noodles. Hot as hell.

204
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,500
Say what you want.

205
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,620
I don't have much time for your bullshit.

206
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:36,480
Cheum,

207
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,450
I'm sorry I hurt your friend.

208
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:42,710
But I'm here because I'm worried…

209
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:43,440
Worried about what?

210
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,650
Mew has changed.

211
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:50,740
And who do you think is the reason?

212
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:00,360
Actually, I'm worried about him too.

213
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,530
I don't like the idea of him hanging out with Ray so much.

214
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,390
We used to stop Ray.

215
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,830
But right now they're both going down to hell.

216
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,770
You know I was rooting for you.

217
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:13,880
Why did you do it?

218
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:18,570
Was Boston so worthy that you were willing to risk losing Mew?

219
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:20,040
Huh?

220
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,930
Was he that good in bed?

221
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,320
It's nothing like that.

222
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:25,790
Please listen.

223
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,620
If you can help me, please do so.

224
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:32,560
If Mew doesn't get back together with me in the end, that's okay.

225
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:34,810
I just don't want Mew to screw up his life because of me.

226
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:37,930
Please help me.

227
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,770
Thank you for thinking of me.

228
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:53,660
I've always thought of you.

229
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,470
I actually wanted you ask you to join us since your internship.

230
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:58,380
You are skillful and disciplined.

231
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,860
Hard to find in this field these days.

232
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:02,520
Thank you.

233
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,460
Let’s cut to the point.

234
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:10,310
My company is doing CG work for a huge film production company in Thailand.

235
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:12,560
Are you interested in working with me on that?

236
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,160
Hey! I am.

237
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:15,360
Don't answer just yet.

238
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,870
Take your time to think.

239
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:21,010
You must know that this is a very huge project.

240
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,250
You have to devote your time to it.

241
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,060
Pulling an all-nighter is very normal.

242
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:28,420
If you're seeing someone, you will not have time for that person.

243
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:34,310
That's no problem at all.

244
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,180
I'm not with anyone.

245
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,040
I'm all alone.

246
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:38,300
Good then.

247
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:41,570
Because you're going to spend a lot of time with me.

248
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:47,330
How have you been doing by the way?

249
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:51,280
And what about Tum? The one you've been seeing since graduation.

250
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,120
We broke up.

251
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,440
Lots of issues.

252
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,050
Sorry, I didn't know.

253
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:01,180
You're fine.

254
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,910
I didn't tell a lot of people about it.

255
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:08,320
But I'm ready to date again.

256
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:12,240
I can't help but feel lonely sometimes. You know?

257
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:16,530
If you have a friend who likes old people, introduce us.

258
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:17,750
Oh, come on.

259
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,550
You're not that old.

260
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:21,040
You still look like a uni student.

261
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,000
Oh, please.

262
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:23,270
Stop licking my ass.

263
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,930
Your job hasn't started yet and you're like this already?

264
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,460
I'm not trying to lick your ass. I'm telling the truth.

265
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,010
But yeah, I want this job too.

266
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,770
If licking your ass can get me this job, I will.

267
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:34,640
Honestly.

268
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:37,550
Am I accepted?

269
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,320
I haven't said yes yet.

270
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,680
Come on. Give me the job.

271
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,690
Hey, Ton.

272
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,520
Hey, Atom.

273
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:57,960
All by yourself?

274
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,670
What about your gang?

275
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,330
I don't know.

276
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:07,360
But I can drink alone just fine.

277
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,260
No problem.

278
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,080
What about you?

279
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:10,930
Why are you here alone?

280
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,180
I just had a fight with my girlfriend.

281
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,450
She is so jealous. It pisses me off.

282
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,510
That's why I'm here.

283
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:21,690
I get that so well.

284
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:25,430
A relationship that lacks trust and freedom is a dead end.

285
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,590
That's true.

286
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:33,090
Can you believe that she tags along and keeps me under her watch every time I go to a bar?

287
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:34,380
Seriously?

288
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,120
Yes.

289
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,230
That's just too much.

290
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:38,730
Sit with me.

291
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,740
Are you sure?

292
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:43,400
I'm going to sit down and complain non-stop about my girlfriend.

293
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,220
Keep it coming.

294
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,960
Order what you want.

295
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,860
My treat.

296
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:48,460
My friend's little brother is my little brother as well.

297
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:50,010
Thank you.

298
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:21,090
Found the book you’re looking for?

299
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,950
Not yet.

300
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:27,720
I think I'm going to keep looking.

301
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:29,050
Are you bored?

302
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,500
You can hit the café.

303
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:41,230
I'm not bored.

304
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:45,260
Take your time. Don't worry about me

305
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,590
But I'm bored.

306
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:55,660
Of me?

307
00:20:57,770 --> 00:20:58,520
Hey.

308
00:20:58,990 --> 00:20:59,920
No.

309
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:04,700
Of myself.

310
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:08,050
I think I'm too plain somehow.

311
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:11,560
Hey. You're thinking too much.

312
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,110
You're not plain.

313
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:16,170
You are delectable.

314
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:18,430
Yeah?

315
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:25,760
Hey.

316
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,410
Should we do something fun?

317
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:29,530
I want to party.

318
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:30,630
I want to smoke.

319
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:32,390
Drink all night.

320
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:33,300
Shall we?

321
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,390
Of course.

322
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:39,140
That's my expertise.

323
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,740
Should we throw a Halloween party at the hostel?

324
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:45,120
Let's get drunk all night long. Get dressed up too.

325
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:45,910
What do you say?

326
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:47,940
Yes.

327
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,520
Very nice idea.

328
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,240
I'll take care of the drinks and music.

329
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,640
Let's hire a DJ instead this time.

330
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:56,070
I don't want a band anymore.

331
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:57,830
Yeah.

332
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,000
I'll set up the event.

333
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,350
You okay?

334
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,430
I don’t feel much.

335
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,720
Wait until it kicks in.

336
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:18,180
Thank you so much, Mew, for picking me.

337
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:23,220
I told you.

338
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,410
You’re the one who never left me.

339
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,660
You never hurt me.

340
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:31,930
You’re someone I should love.

341
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,150
Damn.

342
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,180
I love you, Mew.

343
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:57,910
We should go out there and have fun.

344
00:23:58,410 --> 00:23:59,030
Let’s go.

345
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,450
Ok.

346
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,650
Having fun?

347
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,420
Are you guys drunk yet?

348
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,200
Thank you.

349
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,820
Cheers.

350
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,200
Everyone, enjoy.

351
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:39,940
Why the hell are you here?

352
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:42,130
Who invited you?

353
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:44,230
Numcheum did.

354
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:45,610
Numcheum?

355
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,970
She invited an asshole like you?

356
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:52,610
Are you drunk?

357
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:53,400
Why?

358
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:56,870
Drunk or not isn’t your concern.

359
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:59,510
You don’t have the right to give opinions on my life.

360
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:05,660
Did you use coke?

361
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:08,580
So?

362
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,610
What’s your problem if I did?

363
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,240
Mew.

364
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:19,460
You’ve changed so much.

365
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,580
What are you doing this for?

366
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,320
What for?

367
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,780
For myself.

368
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:33,230
For my happiness.

369
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:34,880
Tell you what.

370
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:39,260
Without you in my life, I have more freedom.

371
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,220
I don't have to worry about who you secretly have sex with.

372
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:45,540
I only care about myself now.

373
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,190
I’m the most important one for me.

374
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:50,110
You take no space in my mind at all.

375
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,130
What?

376
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:00,230
What are you looking at?

377
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,160
Huh?

378
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:05,160
Hey!

379
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:08,200
Mew, what are you doing?

380
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:10,670
I’ve wanted to do that for so long.

381
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:13,760
This too.

382
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:17,830
Whoa!

383
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:40,620
Maybe you should just leave.

384
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:44,640
You’re not welcome in my party.

385
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,110
Don’t go.

386
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,680
I invited him.

387
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:50,390
Can I?

388
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:53,060
Or I can’t because I don’t own the place?

389
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:56,400
Up to you then.

390
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:58,490
I just don’t want him to spoil the fun.

391
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:02,170
Just leave Mew alone.

392
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:07,960
April.

393
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:09,900
Take Top away.

394
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:11,720
Top.

395
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,540
Are you using drugs in our hostel?

396
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,850
What the hell are you thinking?

397
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:29,570
Oh please, Cheum.

398
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,090
Loosen up.

399
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,580
Can’t you see people are having fun?

400
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:38,490
Learn to take responsibility.

401
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:42,110
You were just charged with drunk driving.

402
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:44,120
If you’re arrested again, you will get locked up in prison.

403
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:44,970
Come on, Cheum.

404
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:46,200
Stop nagging.

405
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,720
Are you my mother?

406
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,370
My mother is dead.

407
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,390
Jerk.

408
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:06,980
[Don’t get too drunk.]

409
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:10,510
I don’t get it. Why did you come?

410
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:12,420
I don’t want to be here.

411
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,770
Ton isn’t talking to me.

412
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:16,130
He blocked all my contacts.

413
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:18,980
So I wanted to meet him here.

414
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,660
You’re so persistent.

415
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:22,700
Didn’t we agree on moving on together?

416
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:25,630
What you’re doing is like moving on in a circle.

417
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:35,190
Do you think he’d be here?

418
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:36,720
Isn’t he having a fight with his friends?

419
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:42,190
Someone like Boston wouldn’t miss a party even though he’s having a fight with friends.

420
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:46,990
If I didn’t feel bad about what I did to you, I wouldn’t be here.

421
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:49,290
I would just stay home and chill.

422
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,800
Stop complaining.

423
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:54,610
If I see him, I will talk to him just for a little while.

424
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:55,520
Then we will leave.

425
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:02,600
There.

426
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:03,770
He’s here.

427
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,030
Wait here.

428
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:13,880
Do I look okay?

429
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:16,280
Yes, you’re handsome.

430
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:16,970
Go.

431
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,180
Ton.

432
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,380
You look good tonight.

433
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:45,410
Savage and fierce.

434
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:46,910
It suits you.

435
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,030
Hey.

436
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,250
I’m doing my internship program.

437
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,180
An animation company.

438
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,520
I’m doing a movie.

439
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,550
My senior friend hired me.

440
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:06,470
And why are you telling me?

441
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:21,180
What should I do

442
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,590
to earn your forgiveness?

443
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:25,650
Simple.

444
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,430
Turn around and leave me alone.

445
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,440
You didn’t only wiretap me in the car,

446
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:34,440
but you also told Mew about Gap.

447
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,520
How dare you show up in front of me?

448
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:41,100
But you must admit that what you did was filthy.

449
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,550
Who are you to judge me?

450
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,040
Ton.

451
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:50,600
Atom.

452
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,650
You’re here too?

453
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:52,550
Nice jacket.

454
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:54,700
You’re hot tonight.

455
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,770
Thanks.

456
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,290
What did you dress up as?

457
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:58,180
I dressed up for the theme.

458
00:30:58,630 --> 00:30:59,510
Do you recognize it?

459
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:00,350
Brad Pitt?

460
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:02,170
So how are you doing?

461
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:02,880
Good.

462
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,440
You?

463
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:04,300
Good too.

464
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,620
Should we talk outside?

465
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,950
Too many people here.

466
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:07,850
It’s annoying.

467
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:09,270
Of course.

468
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:11,330
Let me vent about my girlfriend again.

469
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:12,090
Bring it on, bro.

470
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:12,590
Come.

471
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:24,070
I think Freddie Mercury is the best singer in the world.

472
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:25,460
I agree.

473
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,620
Who can sing Bohemian Rhapsody better than him?

474
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,770
I was gonna sing it once at the bar.

475
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:32,340
But once I rehearsed it, I found it too difficult.

476
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,260
I like his story even more.

477
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,030
He used to date a woman.

478
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:38,160
He loved her so much.

479
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:39,480
You know what’s interesting?

480
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:41,400
He later dated a man.

481
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,680
Just like me.

482
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:45,420
You’re bi?

483
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:46,830
I am.

484
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:48,910
Me too.

485
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:57,790
Hey.

486
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:58,660
What are you guys doing?

487
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:07,210
When did you arrive?

488
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:08,860
Why didn’t you come to me?

489
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,810
And why should I go to you?

490
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,400
I’m talking to my friend here.

491
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,660
Am I not your friend too?

492
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:15,860
Talk to me.

493
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:18,970
Have a seat.

494
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,030
What are you two talking about? Can I join the conversation?

495
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,030
About Queen and Freddie Mercury.

496
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,090
So you like them, huh?

497
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,480
You two dressed up in the same theme.

498
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,650
Yes, we do.

499
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,160
Did you sleep with him?

500
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:36,960
Damn it, Ray.

501
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:38,730
Are you high?

502
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:41,260
How about you go to sleep?

503
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,070
I want to sleep with you.

504
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:46,340
Or what?

505
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,140
Should we invite Mr. Freddie here to sleep with us?

506
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:50,890
Let’s do it.

507
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,150
I’ll go first.

508
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,830
Ray!

509
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:56,600
No, thanks. You guys go on.

510
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,170
I want no business with someone else’s boyfriend.

511
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,550
What the f*ck is this?

512
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:04,110
You have Mew now. What do you want from me?

513
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,140
Go guard your boyfriend.

514
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:12,430
I can have feelings for as many people as I want.

515
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:14,370
But you can’t do this to me.

516
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,450
Stop fooling yourself, Sand.

517
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:19,960
You like me.

518
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:22,400
You love me.

519
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,010
You can’t walk away from me.

520
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,560
You’re mine no matter what.

521
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,640
I’m not your second option.

522
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:34,630
Remember that.

523
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:55,620
So I broke up with her.

524
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:59,250
Why would we want to have a relationship if it doesn’t give us peace of mind?

525
00:33:59,250 --> 00:33:59,830
Exactly.

526
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:01,770
That’s why I don’t want it.

527
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,630
Sex only is a lot better.

528
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:05,050
Trust me.

529
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:08,830
By the way,

530
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,780
how long have you realized that you like men?

531
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:14,680
Me?

532
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:18,550
As far as I know, I’ve never had feelings for girls.

533
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:20,640
Since I was born.

534
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,040
What?

535
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:26,580
People can be born gay?

536
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,460
Some people are like that.

537
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:30,770
They are just born to be.

538
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:33,030
They don’t need to find themselves. They just go with it.

539
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:33,760
Just like me.

540
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:38,480
Have you ever taken an interest in men though?

541
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,250
Sometimes.

542
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,350
You, for example, are hot in my opinion.

543
00:34:55,530 --> 00:35:00,730
People with self-confidence like you are very charming to me.

544
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:11,280
Ton.

545
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,790
Why are you here?

546
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,150
I’m in this project too.

547
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:17,220
I have the right.

548
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:19,650
What are you talking to my little bro about?

549
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:21,670
Are you teaching him bad shit?

550
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:24,140
Hey.

551
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:26,150
No need to make a scene.

552
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:28,750
I’m just telling him my life problems.

553
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:31,030
You can talk to me about any problem.

554
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:34,070
Someone like Boston can’t give you advice.

555
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:36,380
He can’t even deal with his own problem.

556
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:37,320
Fine.

557
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,930
I won’t mess with your little bro.

558
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:41,990
But you should give him more attention.

559
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:43,270
Do you even know he broke up with his girlfriend?

560
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:48,800
Consider what kind of big sister you are and why your brother is not telling you anything.

561
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:51,310
You freakin’ jerk.

562
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,640
Don’t get close to him.

563
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:18,150
Trying to get Mew back?

564
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:19,460
I think it’s too late.

565
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:20,920
I bet he and Ray did it countless times.

566
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,460
Cheum told me Mew kicked your ass into the pool.

567
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:31,700
Do you want that again?

568
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,450
Why are you here?

569
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,150
You’re not welcome here.

570
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:51,960
Alright. I’m a social leper.

571
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,860
But I’m still part of this project.

572
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:56,180
I have the right to be here.

573
00:36:58,450 --> 00:36:59,310
And what is this?

574
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:01,820
Did I interrupt something?

575
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:04,280
Are you guys planning to screw each other here?

576
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:06,460
Be my guest.

577
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:08,430
Rooms upstairs are available.

578
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:09,560
Or do you want to do it right here?

579
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:11,530
Guys.

580
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:13,030
They’re f*cking.

581
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:15,190
These assholes are shameless.

582
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,840
Do it.

583
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,590
Mew.

584
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:41,660
Mew, you okay?

585
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:43,350
Get off me.

586
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:55,980
Are you alright?

587
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:20,360
Why do you have to be an asshole, Top?

588
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:01,000
Everybody, remain calm.

589
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:04,690
This is the police.

590
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:09,100
Lights on.

591
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:13,480
Who owns this property?

592
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,430
We received noise complaints.

593
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:17,520
Your neighbors have reported the noise nuisance at nighttime.

594
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,440
Good evening, sir.

595
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:21,790
I work at this hostel.

596
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:23,530
We’re having a small party.

597
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:25,910
If the music is too loud, we can turn it down.

598
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:27,690
How did you throw a party here?

599
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:30,450
Do you get the permission?

600
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,060
Have you notified the authorities?

601
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,590
This is a residential area.

602
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:36,220
You can’t throw a party as you please.

603
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:41,290
Is anyone here using drugs as well?

604
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:42,880
No, sir.

605
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,840
We’re people with the Excellent Youth Award.

606
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,150
Only alcohol here, sir.

607
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:47,730
No drugs allowed.

608
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,860
We need to conduct the search to be sure.

609
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:53,200
Sergeant Major.

610
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:53,700
Yes, sir.

611
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:55,610
Sergeant.

612
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:58,780
Cheum.

613
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:00,490
Are you sure no one is using drugs?

614
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,500
That asshole Ray.

615
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,710
Ray, get up.

616
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:22,570
The cops are here.

617
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:25,020
What cops? I can make some arrangements.

618
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:25,870
You can’t.

619
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:27,710
If you’re arrested again, you will be sent to prison.

620
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,650
No need to make a fuss.

621
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:34,290
I can take care of it.

622
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:35,250
You can’t. Come on.

623
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:39,220
Sand, let go of me.

624
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:40,130
Stop.

625
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,140
Where are you going?

626
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,710
What were you two doing in there?

627
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:46,470
My friend is drunk.

628
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:47,380
I'm taking him home.

629
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:50,770
Don't move.

630
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:54,790
Don't move!

631
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:04,900
What is this?

632
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:07,190
Are you using drugs?

633
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,200
It's nothing, Officer.

634
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,860
It must belong to someone downstairs.

635
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:15,590
They must have put it in his pocket by mistake.

636
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,290
How dare you refuse?

637
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,190
Catch him.

638
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:21,560
Freeze!

639
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:22,780
Let go of me.

640
00:41:22,990 --> 00:41:23,620
Down on your knees.

641
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:25,590
Let go of me.

642
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:26,790
Let me go.

643
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:27,340
Down on your knees.

644
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,050
Ray, stay still.

645
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,930
Ray.

646
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:33,550
Let me go.

647
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:37,940
Top, what should we do?

648
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:42,430
He will be put in prison this time because he was just charged with drunk driving.

649
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:43,290
Cheum, calm down.

650
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:44,540
Let me take care of this.

651
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:46,750
Excuse me, sir.

652
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,720
May I have a word with you, please?

653
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:51,350
This way.

654
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,730
I am so sorry about my friend there.

655
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,570
Ray, be still.

656
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:15,860
What the f*ck is wrong with you Ray?

657
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:22,680
Didn’t I tell you that being friends was good enough?

658
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:25,100
Why did you have to complicate things?

659
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:29,200
And this damn hostel,

660
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,780
you never wanted to run it with me in the first place.

661
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:37,300
You did it just because you wanted something you could share with Mew.

662
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:43,400
Boston and I are just the third wheel.

663
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:46,380
You never care about us.

664
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:53,090
And if you think you're going to keep on seeing Mew,

665
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,260
then I wish you good luck.

666
00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:00,000
But if you guys are not going to quit this behavior,

667
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:02,670
I quit.

668
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,910
Cheum.

669
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,790
Damn it!

670
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:38,260
They're all selfish.

671
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:41,730
They don't care about me.

672
00:43:46,670 --> 00:43:48,340
Is this group really falling apart?

673
00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:52,330
I don't know, Cheum.

674
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:55,080
But don't blame yourself.

675
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:58,020
You did your best as a friend.

676
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:03,180
Whatever happens from now on, let it be their lesson.

677
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:12,590

What’s up, Atom?

706
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:44,450
Leaving?

707
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:45,760
Hell yeah.

708
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:46,880
Too much drama here.

709
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:47,640
How annoying.

710
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:51,600
Can I crash at your place?

711
00:47:55,530 --> 00:47:56,780
I don’t want to go home yet.

712
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:00,270
You better not.

713
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:02,540
Cheum will chew me out.

714
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:11,900
Don’t tell her then.

715
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:23,630
Fine then.

716
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:32,090
I’m not your boss tonight.

717
00:48:32,090 --> 00:48:34,220
Call me Daddy Dan.

718
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:35,150
Take my photo.

719
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:36,160
I want to keep it.

720
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,560
But I took that guy’s photo after we screwed.

721
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:40,710
If you’ve seen me a lot, then why did you just come say hi tonight?

722
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:41,960
I thought you were already taken.

723
00:48:42,070 --> 00:48:42,910
He is.

724
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:44,630
Are you guys going shopping?

725
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:45,420
Can I take you?

726
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:48,740
You’ve stepped into my life. I won’t let you walk away.

727
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:49,320
I like you.

728
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:50,710
I like you so much.

729
00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:51,750
I just don’t want to be anyone’s option.

730
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:54,340
I've never been so yielding to anyone in my life.
