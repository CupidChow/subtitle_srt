1
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:06,860
Top and Ton?

2
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:07,760
How did you get it?

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:09,240
I think you can take a guess.

4
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:10,340
Who was that?

5
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:11,470
Gap, from Engineering.

6
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:13,710
I doubt that he really deleted that video.

7
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,320
I’ve been taking the best care of my Mew.

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,170
Why don’t you take good care of him?

9
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:19,470
How could you do that to me?

10
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:20,850
You guys f*cked, didn't you?

11
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:22,490
Didn’t you?

12
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,760
Can’t you really see that I care about you?

13
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,240
Why would you poke your nose in my business?

14
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,660
What are we to each other?

15
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:29,430
Ray!

16
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:30,540
Let go of me, you shit!

17
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:16,620
Ray.

18
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:17,620
Ray!

19
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:18,930
Ray!

20
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,050
Ray!

21
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:23,620
Ray!

Directed by.   Pinya Chookamsri & Tichakorn Phukhaotong

23
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,390
Fortunately, nothing is broken.

24
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,630
His difficulty in moving could be due to a fractured shoulder bone.

25
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,540
We're taking him to the MRI.

26
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:39,540
If the result shows no signs of cerebral edema or internal bleeding,

27
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,140
he's all set to return home.

28
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:42,440
Alright, ma’am.

29
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:43,770
Thank you so much.

30
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,420
So?

31
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:01,900
Was it worth it?

32
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,190
Driven by love.

33
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,440
I know.

34
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,400
I’m injured.

35
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:08,690
No need to add insult to injury.

36
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,590
What do you expect me to do?

37
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:14,170
Hold your hand and cry like a romantic movie?

38
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,450
I know you’re hurt.

39
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:19,520
But this must be said.

40
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,550
Why did you do it?

41
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,100
You’re lucky you’re the only one injured.

42
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:39,360
If you hit someone to death, you’re a murderer.

43
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,010
Learn to love yourself.

44
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:03,390
Thanks so much for saving my life.

45
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:07,830
Without you, I would’ve been left in the car to die.

46
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,440
No problem.

47
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:12,330
I’m your emergency staff anyway.

48
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,460
I’ve always been since the first day we met.

49
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,110
I’m sorry about Mew.

50
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,540
If I didn’t want to take revenge on Top so much

51
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,260
and sent you the audio clip…

52
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:38,460
Don’t apologize.

53
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,080
It’s not your fault.

54
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:45,810
Nasty people like Top and Ton can’t always hide their nastiness.

55
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,650
Don’t be guilty.

56
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:54,940
Ray!

57
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,160
Hello, sir.

58
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,960
How many times have I told you?

59
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:09,920
Don’t drive when you’re drunk.

60
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:13,530
You know, the cop found a bottle in your car.

61
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,300
I have to talk to them

62
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,740
and take care of the car for you.

63
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,290
How expensive is the car? Do you realize it?

64
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,000
Do you even care?

65
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,580
Or do you drive just for fun?

66
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,290
I almost died, Dad.

67
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,810
All you care about is the car?

68
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,380
It’s not the time to be sarcastic.

69
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:31,850
I keep warning you about drunk driving.

70
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,050
You will be fined.

71
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:34,190
You will have to go to court.

72
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,620
Your driving license will be confiscated.

73
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,960
Maybe I should just send you to jail now.

74
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,790
So you can quit drinking too.

75
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,870
My workload is crazy enough.

76
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:48,390
Yet I need to make time to clean up your mess.

77
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,510
Then just don’t care about me.

78
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:55,580
Like you didn’t care about Mom so she drank herself to death.

79
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,510
And then you will have no burden left.

80
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,220
You’re close to Ray, aren’t you?

81
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,730
I saw you over at the house.

82
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,800
Yes, sir.

83
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,610
Can you please help me with one thing?

84
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:33,840
F*ck!

85
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,420
This is f*cking terrible.

86
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,960
How could he do it?

87
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,450
The word friendship didn’t cross his mind at all?

88
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,790
Now I feel bad too.

89
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,090
I was rooting for Top. I thought he was a good guy.

90
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,620
Okay. I know he’s a player.

91
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,770
But that was too awful of him.

92
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:04,610
Hooking up with his boyfriend’s friend.

93
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,450
Don’t blame yourself, Cheum.

94
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,910
Who would have known?

95
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,420
People only show their good side.

96
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,880
Keep their evil side hidden.

97
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,960
So Ray was trying to expose them, right?

98
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,280
And I yelled at him.

99
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,740
Damn it.

100
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,550
I want to call him and apologize.

101
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,330
I did call him.

102
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,500
But he didn’t pick up.

103
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,400
He might be drunk and sleeping.

104
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,250
Have you talked to Ton?

105
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,130
You want me to yell at him?

106
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,290
I will not stop condemning him.

107
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:45,220
“You f*cking asshole. How could you do that to your friend?”

108
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:48,800
“You piece of shit. You should’ve been born into this world.”

109
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,140
- “You f*cking son of a bitch…”
- There’s no need.

110
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:52,530
Screw him.

111
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,220
He won’t repent.

112
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,960
You know him well.

113
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,420
He hooks up with whoever he wants.

114
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,760
And what?

115
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,780
Are you not going to do anything?

116
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:06,550
Come on. Stop being a good guy.

117
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,680
Don’t worry, Cheum.

118
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,710
I stopped being a good guy.

119
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,250
I got no shit from that.

120
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:20,580
To deal with nasty people, I must be as nasty as them.

121
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:24,410
Ton.

122
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,050
Ton!

123
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:28,620
Ton, you asshole.

124
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Why the hell are you here so early?

125
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:33,010
Hey!

126
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,860
Why did you do that? Huh?

127
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,310
Do what?

128
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,300
I stopped pestering you, Top.

129
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,360
You told me yourself you didn’t want me.

130
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:42,890
So you told Mew everything?

131
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,780
I didn’t say anything.

132
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:47,470
Ray must be the one who told him.

133
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:48,420
Ray?

134
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,270
How could he?

135
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,640
That audio clip was recorded in your car.

136
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,140
What clip?

137
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:58,130
The audio clip of you and me f*cking.

138
00:08:58,130 --> 00:08:59,640
Mew played it to my ears.

139
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:04,020
Did you blackmail me?

140
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:06,470
Why did you do it?

141
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:07,440
Calm your shit, man.

142
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,900
I didn’t do anything.

143
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,060
I didn’t record that audio clip either.

144
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,420
Who was it if wasn’t you?

145
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,530
Ray?

146
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,750
Not Ray.

147
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:16,820
He never even got in my car.

148
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:17,850
Who then?

149
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:19,660
Who else did you f*ck in the car?

150
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:21,540
Who wants Mew to know it?

151
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:24,200
Who doesn’t like the idea of us hooking up?

152
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,950
Why did you wiretap me?

153
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,250
I…

154
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,200
I asked why did you wiretap me?

155
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,480
Calm down, okay?

156
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,440
I just wanted to know if

157
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:44,730
you and Top were still mingling.

158
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,290
I saw your pictures with him.

159
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:51,030
And I wanted to know if you guys were still hooking up.

160
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,810
Are you jealous?

161
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,600
You recorded us and used it to threaten Top to stop messing with me?

162
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,720
And then you told Ray.

163
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,900
Now everyone knows it.

164
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,860
All my friends hate me.

165
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,340
And Top doesn’t want me anymore.

166
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,490
Are you happy now?

167
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:12,850
Huh?

168
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,380
I didn’t tell Ray.

169
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,670
How did he know it then?

170
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,320
How would I know?

171
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,760
What about you?

172
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:28,730
You slept with your friend’s boyfriend.

173
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,520
What the hell were you thinking?

174
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:32,670
It was none of your f*cking business.

175
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,350
You didn’t get a say in this.

176
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,110
You’re the one who started all this.

177
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,420
Nobody was supposed to know about the thing between me and Top.

178
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:45,460
But you, stalker, ruined my life.

179
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,620
Don’t you ever get close to me again.

180
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,270
Ton.

181
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,230
Let go of me!

182
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:54,340
Hear me out first.

183
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:00,210
I love you, Ton.

184
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:03,210
Ton, I love you.

185
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:04,540
I wouldn’t do that to you.

186
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,790
Why would I hurt you?

187
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,080
I just want you to love only me.

188
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:19,410
Love only you?

189
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,500
I never love you.

190
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:25,130
You just can’t get enough of me.

191
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,830
Can I come in?

192
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:30,660
Mew.

193
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:38,540
I’m sorry.

194
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,600
I know what I did was wrong.

195
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,260
I have no excuses.

196
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,670
I know what I did to you was wrong.

197
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,420
But I still…

198
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:00,380
want a chance from you.

199
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:07,950
You’re sorry?

200
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:13,070
Every time I look at you, I see Ton’s face.

201
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,570
And I can’t take it.

202
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,750
Tell me one thing.

203
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,170
Why did you do it?

204
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,060
Did you plan it with him?

205
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,550
No.

206
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,240
There was no plan at all.

207
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:33,940
It was because…

208
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,230
Ton told me about Ray.

209
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:44,780
And you believed him?

210
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,830
Didn’t I tell you everything?

211
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:49,970
What else do you need?

212
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,700
Ton sent me the picture of you and Ray kissing.

213
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,860
And the video clip.

214
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:04,180
He told me you two hooked up.

215
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:16,100
Mew.

216
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:20,700
Right now I don’t even care if you and him did it.

217
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:24,560
I just wanna know what I must do to get a chance from you.

218
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:26,060
Tell me.

219
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:27,600
I will do anything.

220
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:29,940
Are you trying to pick a fight?

221
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,590
I told you I didn’t sleep with him.

222
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,820
We kissed only once.

223
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,500
How many times do I have to say this?

224
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,690
Friends are friends.

225
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,720
Not people who you would f*ck in the car.

226
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,790
So you never trusted me at all?

227
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:51,420
Or is it only an excuse to justify your shitty behavior?

228
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,990
No, Mew.

229
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,030
I believe every word you say.

230
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,940
I love you so much.

231
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:06,720
Why does the word love from you hurt me so damn much?

232
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,030
Mew,

233
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:17,790
If we can get through this together,

234
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,980
I promise I will be a better person.

235
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,920
Try thinking about our good moments.

236
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,190
Good moments?

237
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,110
Like this?

238
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:07,860
I don’t want to remember it anymore.

239
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:31,110
I will make you fall in love with me again.

240
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:14,760
Here.

241
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:17,830
Drink and detox.

242
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:20,020
What is it?

243
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,480
Fruit juice.

244
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,240
It’s so yucky.

245
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,950
Thanks for stopping by though.

246
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,060
I can barely do anything with the injured arm.

247
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,190
Then why did you ask the nurse to leave?

248
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,100
Well, she doesn’t spoil me like you do.

249
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,750
Who says I’m going to spoil you?

250
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:02,870
I’m going to ban you from drinking and smoking until you’re fully recovered.

251
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,840
I just hurt my arm.

252
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,280
It doesn’t concern my internal health.

253
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,570
It does.

254
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,590
Your body is still weak.

255
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:12,590
Heal them both.

256
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:24,770
Sand.

257
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,460
Hmm?

258
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:27,930
Can you give me a shower and shave?

259
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:31,620
Are you trying to annoy me?

260
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,280
Seems like you can do it yourself.

261
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:35,170
I’m not.

262
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,830
And I can’t do it myself. Look at me.

263
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,280
It’s difficult.

264
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:41,000
Help me.

265
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:43,190
Please.

266
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,140
I will drink it all.

267
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:51,140
Do it.

268
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:52,310
Go ahead.

269
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,070
Smell me.

270
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:55,790
Ray!

271
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:56,960
- Sniff me.
- Ray!

272
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,180
You’re smelly.

273
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:01,070
Ow!

274
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,140
You ok?

275
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:04,230
Sand, you hurt me.

276
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,110
Get up.

277
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:07,810
Help me.

278
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,840
I can’t stay over tonight.

279
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:37,610
I need to pack the plum wine.

280
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:39,990
Why?

281
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:43,210
Can’t you stay just one night?

282
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,400
No.

283
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:50,340
You’re more addicted to me than alcohol now.

284
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:52,510
What?

285
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:55,250
Why do people keep saying I’m an alcohol addict?

286
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,310
I’m not.

287
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:59,020
I just drink when I want to.

288
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:01,500
But you want it all the time.

289
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:04,630
Well, I’m stressed.

290
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:06,500
You wouldn’t understand.

291
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:09,150
Look at my dad.

292
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:12,750
I’m still in pain, yet he keeps telling me to go to rehab.

293
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,260
He cares about you, Ray.

294
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:18,370
I care about you too.

295
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:23,920
You wouldn’t get me.

296
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,360
You’re right.

297
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:31,280
I might not get you.

298
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:33,500
I don’t have a father like you do.

299
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,780
Hey, I’m sorry.

300
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:43,060
I didn’t mean it that way.

301
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:45,980
But seriously, Sand.

302
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:48,240
Don’t you want to meet him?

303
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,350
Don’t you want to talk to him?

304
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:56,730
My life is okay now.

305
00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:00,650
A perfect family doesn’t have to be a father, mother, and child.

306
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:05,750
You’re right.

307
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:10,910
I want to take a bath.

308
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:12,520
Wanna join me?

309
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:14,270
No.

310
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:15,600
I don’t have clothes to change into.

311
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,370
I have your Poor Boy T-shirt here.

312
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,960
Come on.

313
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,040
Just chill out and talk about life problems.

314
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:28,500
Heal your body and soul.

315
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:27,910
Ray.

316
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:29,960
It’s a big deal.

317
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,710
Didn’t you think you should at least tell us?

318
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,650
I didn’t want you guys to worry.

319
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,820
I planned to tell you after I got discharged from the hospital.

320
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:40,030
You just made us worry even more.

321
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,500
Why didn’t you think of us when there’s a problem?

322
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:44,870
I’m so upset right now.

323
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,680
I’m sorry.

324
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,560
I thought you guys hated me already.

325
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,330
About the night I was drunk at Yo’s.

326
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:54,780
I was mad at you for telling April about me.

327
00:25:55,250 --> 00:26:00,430
But I get that you were trying to tell Mew about Top and Ton.

328
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:03,170
You knew about that.

329
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,160
Yes, sir.

330
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,690
The whole nation knows about it.

331
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:10,360
Hey.

332
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:13,380
I broke up with Top.

333
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:22,020
I’m sorry I punched you.

334
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:27,980
That night I thought I should take matters into my own hands

335
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:31,180
The one that’s gonna hurt them…

336
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,240
must be me.

337
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:49,400
Hey.

338
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:50,900
Are you okay?

339
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:54,500
No.

340
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,830
My first relationship was a big fat failure.

341
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:04,210
I think this is worse than being nailed and bailed.

342
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:06,890
It’s like being tricked into loving him.

343
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:11,590
It’s like throwing a ball to a wall.

344
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,440
It bounces right back in my face.

345
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,260
It hurts like hell.

346
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,460
That’s such a clear metaphor.

347
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:34,540
You still have me here.

348
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:39,630
Thanks a lot.

349
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,430
That son of a bitch.

350
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:15,920
Why the hell are you here?

351
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,300
I saw Cheum’s IG Stories.

352
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:21,480
My friend broke his arm so I came to visit.

353
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,600
So you care about your friends?

354
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:25,500
It’s not like you at all.

355
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:29,120
You usually do things behind people’s backs.

356
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:32,520
Okay.

357
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:34,620
I’m here to get yelled at.

358
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:35,820
Yell at me all you want.

359
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:37,030
Get it over with.

360
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:38,440
Come on.

361
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,770
You think it’s that easy?

362
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:45,850
You think yelling at you will make up for sleeping with my boyfriend?

363
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,350
I guess your logic is messed up.

364
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,760
I don’t expect it to be over.

365
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,130
I just want you to vent.

366
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:56,280
Are you even thinking of apologizing to him, Ton?

367
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,940
Stop playing a good friend, Ray.

368
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,780
It’s annoying.

369
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,060
Everything is in your favor now.

370
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,220
Just like you hope for.

371
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,520
You want to replace Top.

372
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,670
Damn you, Boston.

373
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:16,130
Fine.

374
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,460
I’m sorry.

375
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,860
I didn’t mean to. It was unintentional.

376
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,760
Unintentional, my ass.

377
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,140
You meant it, didn’t you?

378
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,710
It’s your plan.

379
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:32,310
If you wanted him, why did you freakin’ match us up?

380
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:34,710
You wanted him too.

381
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:35,480
Right?

382
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:37,730
Don’t blame it all on me.

383
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:42,560
Besides, I slept with Top even before you did.

384
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:46,880
Theoretically, he picked me first.

385
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,030
You came later.

386
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,010
Ton, you asshole.

387
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:51,050
Mew.

388
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:52,220
Mew!

389
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:52,870
Easy.

390
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,290
Ton.

391
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,390
Why are you here?

392
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:57,810
Go away.

393
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,180
Calm down.

394
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:03,450
Ah!

395
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,390
You guys don’t want me anymore, right?

396
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:09,620
It was so nice of me to introduce Mew to something new.

397
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:12,370
I just borrowed him for a bit. What’s a big deal?

398
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:14,780
Let’s be honest here.

399
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:20,300
Without my help, there was no way Mew got his hands on a top-tier like that.

400
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,400
Ton, you motherf*cker!

401
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,210
Mew!

402
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,430
Mew!

403
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:27,180
Mew, stop.

404
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:28,620
Guys, stop it.

405
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:29,990
Mew.

406
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:33,470
Damn it!

407
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:34,370
Enough!

408
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:36,600
Both of you, stop it.

409
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:39,410
Are you gonna kill me or what?

410
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:40,090
Yes.

411
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,870
Someone like you should just die.

412
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:42,520
Ton.

413
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,410
You just go.

414
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:48,300
If you don’t repent your sin, don’t ever come back to us.

415
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:51,860
You are such a nasty person.

416
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,220
Selfish.

417
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:55,590
Friends don’t do that to friends.

418
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:02,290
Get lost!

419
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,290
Nick, what’s all this stuff?

420
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:49,000
I’m moving out.

421
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:50,560
I can’t live with a thief.

422
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:53,230
What thief? Who stole anything from you?

423
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:54,280
You did.

424
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:57,030
You stole Ton’s audio clip and gave it to Ray, right?

425
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,050
Ton scolded me at the shop.

426
00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:02,100
Mew and Top broke up.

427
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:14,240
I’m sorry, man.

428
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:17,260
I just wanted to get revenge on Top.

429
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:18,980
Revenge?

430
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,540
You destroyed my happiness.

431
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:23,930
Ton hates me now.

432
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:32,750
I’m truly sorry about the clip.

433
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,000
I really feel bad.

434
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,410
But Boston,

435
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:36,460
he’s a f*cking asshole.

436
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,540
Why do you even care about him?

437
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:38,420
So?

438
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:39,910
This is my call.

439
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:42,680
None of your f*cking business.

440
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:02,130
Sand.

441
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,230
I love him.

442
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:08,340
I love him.

443
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:12,700
He doesn’t have to care about me.

444
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:15,810
I don’t have to be his number one.

445
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:19,180
But he must not hate me.

446
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,730
Do you get it?

447
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,740
I get you.

448
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:33,390
In fact, I get you so damn well.

449
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,490
I get you, man.

450
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,220
I get it.

451
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:42,560
I’m sorry.

452
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:44,060
I’m sorry.

453
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,850
He’s about to love me.

454
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:54,830
Why did you do this to me?

455
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,590
I trusted you.

456
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:53,730
I know everything, Nick.

457
00:34:55,560 --> 00:35:00,700
And I can tell you’re the one who recorded the audio clip of Top and Boston.

458
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:08,060
Yes.

459
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:11,180
I’m sorry, Mew.

460
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:15,480
Hey.

461
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,700
Why are you apologizing?

462
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,100
You did the right thing.

463
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:25,600
I should be thanking you.

464
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:33,530
Nick.

465
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:39,200
We’re both victims.

466
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:44,600
Someone like Boston	doesn't give a damn about anyone.

467
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:46,720
He only cares about himself.

468
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:49,630
He must learn his lesson.

469
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:52,460
Don’t let him take you for granted.

470
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,920
How about we find a way to make him pay?

471
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:02,730
What are you going to do?

472
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,870
Is there anything I can use to hurt him

473
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,340
since this guy doesn’t care about anyone else?

474
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:27,760
Actually, there is one thing.

475
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,160
Boston hooked up with someone and that guy recorded his video.

476
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:45,870
Boston hooked up with a guy named Gap.

477
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:47,410
Faculty of Engineering.

478
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,200
He has an account called Fan For Fun.

479
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:52,720
His content is shot by hidden cameras.

480
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:58,430
Boston caught him and asked him to delete it.

481
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:01,850
But I don’t think he did.

482
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:13,590
I’m sorry.

483
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:17,270
That’s fine.

484
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:18,340
It was nothing.

485
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,440
Is it your first time here?

486
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,590
You don’t look familiar.

487
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:26,410
Yes.

488
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,030
I want to try a new place.

489
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:33,580
But you look familiar to me.

490
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:35,060
It’s like I’ve seen you somewhere.

491
00:37:38,190 --> 00:37:40,240
You probably saw my work before.

492
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:42,890
Ah!

493
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,710
That rings a bell.

494
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,110
I’m your supporter.

495
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,260
Excuse me.

496
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:53,080
I need to use the bathroom.

497
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:21,890
That look you gave.

498
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:25,050
Was it intended to lure me to come after you?

499
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:31,890
It worked, didn’t it?

500
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:46,960
Right here?

501
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,400
That’s alright.

502
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:53,540
Exciting.

503
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:55,130
I’m in the mood to try something new.

504
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:00,000
Should we go to your place?

505
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:02,950
More convenient for different positions.

506
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:18,080
Do you want to film me?

507
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:20,680
Can I?

508
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,230
It’s more exciting.

509
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:26,440
But don’t capture my face.

510
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:28,670
Sure.

511
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:30,170
Can...

512
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:34,650
Can I see your other videos first?

513
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,070
I want to check the angles.

514
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:42,810
Of course.

515
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:06,920
Is that ok?

516
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:10,330
It is.

517
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,180
No showing faces.

518
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,020
It’s safe.

519
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,700
Can I ask you a favor?

520
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,900
Take a shower first.

521
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:29,400
Why?

522
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,840
Am I that smelly?

523
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,000
No.

524
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:35,650
We were in a nightclub.

525
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:37,170
Full of cigarette smoke.

526
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,320
It can kill the mood.

527
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,410
Sure then.

528
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:49,570
I promise your subscribers will increase if you post my video.

529
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:41,000
What are you doing?

530
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:49,170
Watching some other videos.

531
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:52,000
Are you stealing my videos?

532
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:58,350
Yes.

533
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:01,650
I just wanted the one with my friend filmed secretly.

534
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:02,870
Secretly?

535
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,080
I never film anyone secretly.

536
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,570
Everyone agrees to it.

537
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:08,320
Oh, yeah?

538
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:10,170
What about Boston?

539
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:12,270
Did he agree to it?

540
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:13,730
You still have his video.

541
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:18,610
I can turn you in for violating his consent.

542
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,940
Did he ask you to get it?

543
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:22,910
Not your concern.

544
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:26,490
If you don't want to go to jail, stay out of it.

545
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,560
I’m voting for you, sir.

546
00:43:11,810 --> 00:43:14,310
Your policies give me hope.

547
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:18,560
I as well hope to get into the parliament.

548
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:21,060
I’m number one on the poll.

549
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:24,030
I hope the election result is the same.

550
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:26,540
You will surely win this, sir.

551
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:33,550
Ton.

552
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:36,480
You asked your friend to come over but you’re so late.

553
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:38,530
I didn’t ask him to come.

554
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,250
Why didn’t you call first?

555
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,600
I did but you didn’t pick up.

556
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:47,530
So I talked to your dad while waiting.

557
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:50,270
I was about to tell him about your short film.

558
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:52,930
What short film? I never acted in a short film.

559
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:56,190
The short film you played with an Engineering boy named Gap.

560
00:43:56,670 --> 00:43:57,870
Don’t you remember?

561
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,530
I just saw it.

562
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:01,310
No need to be embarrassed.

563
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:03,110
You played so well.

564
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:04,990
I was about to show it to your dad.

565
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:09,830
So he knows how good of an actor you are.

566
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:12,360
What’s up with you?

567
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:14,070
Why never tell me anything?

568
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,140
Are you interested in acting too?

569
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:20,550
Ton is great, sir.

570
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:22,350
Especially, at doing things behind people’s backs.

571
00:44:24,270 --> 00:44:27,130
He keeps surprising me.

572
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:30,410
Do you want to watch it now, sir?

573
00:44:30,410 --> 00:44:31,250
I will play it.

574
00:44:31,390 --> 00:44:32,140
Let’s watch it.

575
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:33,820
I want to see his skills.

576
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:34,700
Play it.

577
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:49,450
Can I have a word with Mew first? You can watch it later.

578
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:57,750
How did you have the video?

579
00:44:58,230 --> 00:44:59,780
It didn’t get deleted?

580
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,230
That’s what he told you?

581
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,210
You and I have something in common.

582
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,100
We are gullible.

583
00:45:38,330 --> 00:45:39,210
That seems fun.

584
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:41,300
Teach me sometimes, will you?

585
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:43,300
Mew.

586
00:45:43,970 --> 00:45:45,370
I know you want payback.

587
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:47,830
But you can’t show this to my dad.

588
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:52,100
Why not?

589
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:58,510
It might help him get closer to voting citizens.

590
00:45:58,910 --> 00:45:59,690
Mew.

591
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:02,350
My dad doesn’t know about my private life.

592
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,650
His reputation will be wrecked if the video goes public.

593
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:07,760
I’m begging you, Mew.

594
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:09,260
Don’t do it.

595
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:11,090
For the sake of our friendship.

596
00:46:11,410 --> 00:46:12,350
Please, Mew.

597
00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:13,850
I’ll do just anything.

598
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:15,100
Friendship, huh?

599
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:18,650
Is that what you just said?

600
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:24,160
When you hooked up with Top, did you think of our friendship?

601
00:46:36,610 --> 00:46:37,420
Hey.

602
00:46:37,690 --> 00:46:38,870
I’m kidding.

603
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:42,230
Are you seriously thinking I’m gonna post it online?

604
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:50,370
No matter how much I hate you, I won’t do it.

605
00:46:52,730 --> 00:46:55,450
Because I don’t betray my friend like you did.

606
00:46:57,140 --> 00:46:58,350
If I did,

607
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:02,130
then I’d be just as filthy as you are.

608
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:06,730
I don’t want to be that kind of person.

609
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:10,270
I don’t want to be friendless.

610
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:12,840
My moms taught me well.

611
00:47:14,030 --> 00:47:15,520
When we meet filthy people,

612
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:20,240
we don’t have to be filthy like them.

613
00:47:45,170 --> 00:47:46,900
Just like the professor said.

614
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:50,130
You guys managed to fight eventually.

615
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:51,810
Now what?

616
00:47:53,450 --> 00:47:54,580
Are we still doing this?

617
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,520
Ray’s father invested in it.

618
00:47:58,610 --> 00:47:59,810
The hostel must be opened.

619
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:02,530
I want my honor student title too.

620
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:05,530
I’ve worked hard for four years.

621
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:08,040
I won’t let anything get in my way.

622
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:11,560
I will take responsibility for my part.

623
00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:12,940
Let’s get it done.

624
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:14,030
Okay.

625
00:48:15,090 --> 00:48:16,270
We started it.

626
00:48:16,270 --> 00:48:17,350
We should finish it.

627
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:20,720
Then throw away your personal issues for now.

628
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:33,040
How dare you show up here?

629
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:40,550
Mew.

630
00:48:41,590 --> 00:48:42,870
I stopped by a bookshop.

631
00:48:42,870 --> 00:48:44,140
Found books you might like.

632
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:45,590
You want to take a look?

633
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:48,200
There’s no need.

634
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:49,680
I won’t read them anyway.

635
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:53,920
They can be the decoration.

636
00:48:55,790 --> 00:48:56,580
No, thanks.

637
00:48:57,790 --> 00:48:59,190
I don’t like the old design.

638
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:01,680
Ray.

639
00:49:02,570 --> 00:49:04,230
Can you find me a new designer?

640
00:49:05,030 --> 00:49:06,600
I don’t like the old design anymore.

641
00:49:07,070 --> 00:49:08,120
I think it looks fake.

642
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:10,160
Of course.

643
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:12,450
I have lots of designer friends.

644
00:49:13,010 --> 00:49:14,440
Let’s find someone who can be trusted.

645
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:18,730
I already bought them.

646
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:20,030
Why don’t you take a look?

647
00:49:20,210 --> 00:49:20,810
Hey!

648
00:49:22,590 --> 00:49:23,990
Can’t you see he’s uncomfortable?

649
00:49:24,450 --> 00:49:25,700
Stop pestering him.

650
00:49:26,810 --> 00:49:28,060
I’m his boyfriend.

651
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:29,030
I have the right to make it up to him.

652
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:30,980
You have Boston.

653
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:33,030
You two are free now.

654
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,170
Get together with him.

655
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:36,720
You deserve each other.

656
00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:40,390
Hey!

657
00:49:40,390 --> 00:49:41,230
Top!

658
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:43,840
Calm down.

659
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:45,600
You stop it!

660
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:46,920
Calm!

661
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:48,060
Ray, stop.

662
00:49:48,370 --> 00:49:49,410
Enough, you all!

663
00:49:49,410 --> 00:49:50,660
Guys, stop!

664
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:52,350
Stop!

665
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:54,230
Mew.

666
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:55,490
Mew!

667
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:56,930
What the hell?

668
00:49:57,350 --> 00:49:58,060
Mew.

669
00:49:58,870 --> 00:49:59,650
I’m sorry.

670
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:00,310
Top!

671
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:01,570
Go!

672
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:03,790
Don’t make things worse.

673
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:11,310
You shouldn’t have stepped in and helped me.

674
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:14,470
You get hurt instead.

675
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:16,940
I’m the reason for this.

676
00:50:19,110 --> 00:50:21,810
It’s karma for punching you at my birthday party.

677
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:24,720
But this is good.

678
00:50:25,870 --> 00:50:27,350
At least I’m enlightened now.

679
00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:29,470
I quit being stupid.

680
00:50:29,470 --> 00:50:30,850
Stop wasting my time on Top.

681
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:38,140
Friends take care of friends.

682
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:44,420
Really? Only friends?

683
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,840
I told you to regard me as a friend only.

684
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:55,430
You haven’t been able to do so, have you?

685
00:50:57,900 --> 00:50:58,580
Um.

686
00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:03,530
I knew it all along.

687
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:07,360
I just don’t want to lose you.

688
00:51:14,330 --> 00:51:15,430
Why, Mew?

689
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,840
Why can’t I be more than a friend?

690
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:20,580
What did I do wrong?

691
00:51:20,770 --> 00:51:22,140
I’m not as good as Top?

692
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:24,830
It’s not like you’re not as good as him.

693
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:27,990
You’re just not right.

694
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:32,110
I’m not the right one because you never give me a chance.

695
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:41,080
About the other day,

696
00:51:44,490 --> 00:51:45,580
I’m sorry.

697
00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:48,020
You were so down because of me, right?

698
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:49,560
That’s why you drank so much.

699
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:54,710
It’s my fault, Mew.

700
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:56,880
It’s all my doing.

701
00:51:58,500 --> 00:51:59,440
Not your fault.

702
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:07,080
Thank you so much, Ray,

703
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:10,660
for always trying.

704
00:52:12,350 --> 00:52:14,350
You never hurt me for once.

705
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:19,570
I, on the other,

706
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:24,210
were so obsessed with someone I just met.

707
00:52:26,730 --> 00:52:27,670
I guess that’s how humans are.

708
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:33,120
We know the worth of someone close only when it’s too late.

709
00:52:37,390 --> 00:52:38,860
It’s never too late, Mew.

710
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:46,010
I love you no matter what.

711
00:52:53,310 --> 00:52:55,310
It’s all up to you whether you want to open your heart to me.

712
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:02,090
Perhaps

713
00:53:03,870 --> 00:53:05,320
the one I should love

714
00:53:07,550 --> 00:53:08,620
is you.

715
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:23,780
Directed by
Pinya Chookamsri & Tichakorn Phukhaotong

716
00:54:24,490 --> 00:54:27,190
If he truly loved you, he wouldn’t have introduced you to bad stuff.

717
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,970
What should I do to earn your forgiveness?

718
00:54:31,970 --> 00:54:34,590
But right now, I’m ready to date again.

719
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:36,830
Hey, what are you doing?

720
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:40,520
I can have feelings for as many people as I like.

721
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:42,000
I’m not your rebound.

722
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,040
Everyone, remain calm.

723
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:44,550
This is the police

724
00:54:44,550 --> 00:54:46,200
Are you sure no one is using drugs?

725
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:46,910
That asshole Ray.
