No problem.

I want it again.

What are we to each other?

00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,270
You should be glad to be my favorite.

If you go on,

13
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:35,920
it won’t be just friends anymore.

14
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,750

What?

22
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:14,850
Why looking at me like that?

23
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,460
You’re down bad for me or what?

24
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,670
You’re down bad for me.

Don’t be.

You told me you hated drama too.

I’m not being dramatic.

35
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,020
I just don’t like it when you say regular.

36
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,910
It sounds like you’re my customer.

37
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,910
Alright. I’m sorry.

38
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,820
I didn’t mean it that way.

We might want to push it further in the near future.

How further are we talking about here?

44
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,640
I don’t know.

No.

I can manage.

56
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:22,820
I can drive you.

Are you going to charge me for last night?

68
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:07,860

Besides, you should save your money for a shrink.

Good then.

71

Let’s do it.

76
00:07:58,860 --> 00:07:59,680
Hold on.

77
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,590
The hostel isn’t finished yet. You want to have a party already?

78
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:04,900
We don’t have to wait until it’s finished.

79
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,960
Atom, do you know that we’re opening a hostel?

80
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,940
How would I know that? You never told me.

81
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:16,430
Which do you prefer, being told or being asked to a pool party?

Right?

84
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,160
It’s a great PR.

85
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,830
It can even set the overall mood and tone of your hostel.

Which type do you want?

127
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:27,180
Only video recording or voice recording as well?

128
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:27,950
Yeah?

129
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:30,250

Of course.

131

00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,090
It can even connect to your phone.

I have wiretaps too if you want.

We’re opening a hostel, not a spy company.

Sure.

146
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,950
But it’s an urgent service.

147
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,040
I want something in return.

148
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,140
Right now?

00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,810

00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:26,940
Not this.

00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,270
What then?

153
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,750
You’ll see.

154
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:41,960
Look.

155
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,270
What are they dancing to?

156
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:46,970
It’s called Silent Disco.

157
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:48,150
You hear music from your headphones.

158
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:49,850
There are two DJs there.

159
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:52,080
You can choose the kind of music that you like.

160
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:55,120
This way we can share the same space even if we like different types of music.

161
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,450
Give it a try.

162
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,970
What are you listening to?

163
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:30,720

187
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,170
I’m blinded by the love for you anyway.

188
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:11,050
Who would have thought a rich man could come up with this cheesy line?

189
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:13,910
♪ I guess good guys only exist in fairy stories ♪

190
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:19,730
♪ I’m a villain, no matter how much I love you, I must die eventually ♪

191
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:23,640
♪ In the end, he’s the one who has your love ♪

192
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:36,360
Thank you.

193
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,090
Hey, Top.

194
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,170
Beam.

195
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,370
Didn’t think I’d see you here.

196
00:14:58,930 --> 00:14:59,510
Oh.

197
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:01,260
Beam, this is Mew.

198
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,120
Mew, this is Beam.

199
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:02,810
Hi.

200
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:03,960
Hi.

201
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,070
You haven’t been out much lately.

202
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,380
I’ve missed you.

203
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,720
You used to go out partying with me every week.

204
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,610
Not anymore.

205
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,390
I’m taking better care of my health.

206
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:16,740
Bullshit.

207
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,570
You care about your health or you just have a boyfriend?

208
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:21,350
You don’t reply to my messages.

209
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:22,630
Why?

210
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,040
Your boyfriend is jealous?

211
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:28,010
With me, he doesn’t need to be jealous.

212
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:31,110
I’m taking care of you well in and out of bed.

213
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,020
Right?

214
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,130
Hey, I need to go now.

215
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:39,820
I’ll call you later.

216
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:40,950
Okay?

217
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,280
See you.

218
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:43,930
See you.

219
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,460
No one knows me better than you.

220
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,360
Who was that, Top?

221
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:56,390
Ah.

222
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,340
Someone I hang out with sometimes.

223
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,910
Don’t mind him.

224
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,320
Let’s continue where we left off.

225
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,780
Wow.

226
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:18,030
I bet this is very convenient for you, jackass.

227
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,090
You didn’t have to use a moving service.

228
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:23,840
Think of it as the price for my CCTV installation service.

229
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,220
Why don’t you stay home with your parents?

230
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:30,120
No way.

231
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,190
They’re naggers.

232
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,990
I lied to them, saying I wanted to live near the university.

233
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:36,580
Besides,

234
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,550
if I stay home,

235
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,990
I can’t bring people over, right?

236
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:57,190
Alright. Get your stuff inside.

237
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,450
Hey, Sand!

238
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:00,550
Boston.

239
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,970
You two know each other?

240
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,750
Who doesn’t know him?

241
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:08,410
Boston, the guy that every table knows.

242
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,650
He’s a regular customer at YOLO.

243
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,060
I’m just friendly.

244
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,360
How did you two know each other?

245
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,710
You guys are close enough to help each other move?

246
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:19,260
Ah.

247
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,930
I’m helping him with the CCTV setup…

248
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,870
at the hostel he runs with his friends.

249
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:25,890
Hostel?

250
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,870
Let’s get this inside.

251
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:29,180
Okay. Come on in.

252
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:35,280
This is damn heavy.

253
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,780
If you want to hire him, ask him.

254
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,020
Not me.

255
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,540
I should let you know first.

256
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:49,630
I’m afraid you’d think I’m stealing your singer.

257
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,890
Didn’t you already?

258
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,590
What are you talking about?

259
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,730
This is not suspicious at all.

260
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,820
What is it that you’re hiding from me?

261
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,550
Are you into my bar’s singer or something?

262
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,110
No.

263
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,800
Nothing is suspicious.

264
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,980
We’re only friends.

265
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,030
What’s up, Ray?

266
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,350
You’re drinking this early?

267
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,670
I’m here to talk business, not to drink.

268
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:17,830
What kind of person do you think I am?

269
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,840
What else should I think?

270
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,130
I see you here more than at university.

271
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,240
I see you here often too.

272
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,280
Duh!

273
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:27,110
Of course, you do.

274
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:28,640
He’s a bartender here.

275
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:30,410
More importantly,

276
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,830
he’s my boyfriend. Can’t you see?

277
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,380
I don’t have to do anything.

278
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,440
So protective of each other.

279
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,220
Let me help.

280
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:41,960
Can I get one like this too?

281
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,180
There’s no way.

282
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,090
I’m the one and only.

283
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,350
There he is.

284
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,840
Sand is here.

285
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:51,020
If you want to ask him anything, go ahead.

286
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,200
I don’t want to get in the middle.

287
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:53,710
I’m a country girl, not a nosy girl.

288
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:57,440
Sweet as sugar, hard as ice. Hurt me once, I'll kill you twice. Haven’t you heard?

289
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,910
Oh, please stop.

290
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:02,920
Miss Tim is here?

291
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:05,970
Why don’t you ever eat at your university, student?

292
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,100
You always eat here.

293
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,400
She isn’t here.

294
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,380
She’s on leave.

295
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,650
Cook yourself whatever you want to eat.

296
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:13,810
Ingredients are in the fridge.

297
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:14,880
Alright then.

298
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:21,250
We’re throwing a party at the hostel this Sat.

299
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:22,590
Come play for us.

300
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,010
This Sat?

301
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:24,950
What time?

302
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,390
I guess…

303
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:30,090
around late in the evening.

304
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,030
Do you have to play at this bar?

305
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:34,680
No problem.

306
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,660
I can find someone to sub for me.

307
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,330
What now?

308
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,360
I already said yes.

309
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:52,280
I’m hungry.

310
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:53,640
Can I eat too?

311
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:57,140
Is there any duty I haven’t done for you?

312
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:02,740
I’m your driver, drinking buddy, and shrink.

313
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,010
And now I’m your chef?

314
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,260
There’s one more duty you haven’t said.

315
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,640
It’s a one-time thing. It doesn’t count.

316
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:13,480
It doesn’t have to be a one-time thing.

317
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:15,280
I can eat more.

318
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:16,680
It’s delicious.

319
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,210
If you want to eat, help out.

320
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,050
I’m sure you’ll love my Railway Fried Rice.

321
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,470
Chop it.

322
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:44,870
It’s so good.

323
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,030
I guess I have to eat it more often.

324
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:50,990
What is this?

325
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:53,380
You’re not my special one.

326
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:54,940
I don’t have to cook for you repeatedly.

327
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:57,010
I’m not special yet?

328
00:20:58,810 --> 00:20:59,720
We’re only friends.

329
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:01,610
Friends who slept together.

330
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:03,620
That’s right.

331
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:04,820
What?

332
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,690
You think I want you as my boyfriend?

333
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,020
Of course not.

334
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,760
I just like to tease you.

335
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,260
I like your stupid reaction.

336
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:19,540
You asshole.

337
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,950
If you want a boyfriend, get yourself a boyfriend.

338
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:23,100
Not messing with me.

339
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,530
Hey, wait.

340
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:28,320
Seriously.

341
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:31,090
Are you okay with this?

342
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,040
Yeah, I am okay.

343
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:38,500
You’re happy. I’m happy.

344
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,200
We don’t develop it.

345
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,290
It shouldn’t be a problem, right?

346
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,240
But I still want to talk to you.

347
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:46,990
You’re fun to talk to.

348
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:49,810
Sure.

349
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:53,840
I can differentiate between love and sex.

350
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,530
Okay.

351
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:58,000
It’s settled then.

352
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,040
See you on Sat.

353
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,020
And…

354
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:06,460
Thank you for making the Railway Fried Rice for me.

355
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,770
Finger-lickin’ good.

356
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,400
Bye then.

357
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,360
His shop provides one-stop IT services.

358
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,510
You can bring your broken laptop or phone there.

359
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:31,600
It’s also near the uni.

360
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:33,120
Awesome.

361
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,390
You can trust me on IT stuff.

362
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,450
Thanks a lot, Nick.

363
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:42,650
By the way, if you have time this Saturday, come join us here.

364
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:43,880
It will be fun.

365
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:45,770
Sure.

366
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:47,860
It should be a bunch of people. Should be fun.

367
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:48,370
Of course.

368
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,540
The catering department is here.

369
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:51,950
What are you guys discussing?

370
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:53,740
What took you guys so long?

371
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,050
Did you use your duty as an excuse to go on a date?

372
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,550
No excuse.

373
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,060
We didn’t go on a date.

374
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:04,550
I visited every restaurant just to find the best for you.

375
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,420
Thank you very much then.

376
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:11,360
Oh, this is Nick. He’s Ton’s friend.

377
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:13,210
He’s helping us with the CCTV.

378
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:14,050
Hi.

379
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,530
This is my friend Mew.

380
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:20,900
And that’s Top. He’s in charge of the interior design and miscellaneous things.

381
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,000
He’s also Mew’s boyfriend.

382
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:09,600
Hey, Ton.

383
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:12,280
How long have Top and Mew been together?

384
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:14,210
Less than three months.

385
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,540
Mew keeps saying Top isn’t his boyfriend yet.

386
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:20,630
While deep down, he wants him so badly.

387
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,330
Why are you asking?

388
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,710
You like Top too?

389
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:26,460
Huh?

390
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,530
No.

391
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,160
Just curious.

392
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:31,420
I won’t be surprised if you like him.

393
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:33,300
Look at him.

394
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,040
He’s a top-tier just like his name says.

395
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:36,840
And…

396
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,690
you?

397
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:39,610
Do you like him?

398
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,540
No.

399
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,310
I don’t like hotness.

400
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,510
I like cuteness like you.

401
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:56,090
I know.

402
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,220
Let’s go now.

403
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:00,950
Wait.

404
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:04,370
What if people ask what are we to each other?

405
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:05,780
What should I say?

406
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,120
What else can you say?

407
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:10,290
Friends, of course.

408
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,620
Come on.

409
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:23,270
Why would you go to the trouble of explaining yourself?

410
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,250
Alright then.

411
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:32,930
You can call our relationship whatever you like.

412
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,540
Okay?

413
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,020
Okay.

414
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:46,950
Fine.

415
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:50,070
Now get off. Let’s go.

416
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:19,530
So you do know how to put on colorful clothes.

417
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,620
You normally wear dark colors.

418
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:23,520
I dressed up for the theme.

419
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,870
What’s the reason to wear black?

420
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:26,770
Visiting your funeral?

421
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:27,570
You, dickhead.

422
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:30,470
I asked you nicely. Why did you have to trouble me?

423
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:32,720
Because your face asks for trouble.

424
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:37,240
So…

425
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,160
What genre are you playing tonight?

426
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,480
I think Bossa.

427
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,510
Come on. Be serious.

428
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:46,450
Don’t worry. I did my homework.

429
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:48,950
Can I get a song from Micro?

430
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:51,610
I don’t know.

431
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,300
I’m not a jukebox.

432
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,080
You’re gonna have to wait and find out.

433
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:00,660
Looking forward to hearing it.

434
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:10,010
So?

435
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:15,530
I can smell something between you and the singer at Yo’s bar.

436
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:19,140
That’s why you volunteered to take care of the music.

437
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:22,350
Damn you.

438
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:24,030
It’s nothing.

439
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,230
I just like it when he sings.

440
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:28,950
He’s got a nice voice.

441
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:34,930
But I think you like more than his music and his voice.

442
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,830
I’m your friend. What makes you think I can’t see it?

443
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:40,590
Mew, it’s nothing.

444
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:41,900
I don’t have feelings for him.

445
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:43,450
Really.

446
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:44,570
Fine.

447
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:46,940
Your fruit punch.

448
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:48,980
Thank you, Top.

449
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:51,200
I’m gonna start with this punch.

450
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:52,930
It’s still too early to get drunk.

451
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:54,370
It’s all fine.

452
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:56,720
If you’re drunk, I’ll take care of you.

453
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,580
Who hired this band?

454
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:15,480
Me.

455
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:17,670
Do you have a problem?

456
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:21,540
No. It’s just…

457
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,210
They’re nobody.

458
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:26,830
You want people to know about this place.
You should’ve brought a well-known band.

459
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:28,560
I have friends in record labels.

460
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,480
I can use some connections.

461
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:31,180
It’s okay.

462
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,230
I like this band.

463
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:37,040
Besides, this party is exclusive.

464
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,700
I don’t want to make it huge.

465
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:41,960
If I want a famous band, I can find one.

466
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,170
I know people.

00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:29,790
I think tonight

477
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,110
Top is finally gonna get Mew.

478
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:34,460
He's been holding it for so long.

479
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,330
Who’s sleeping with who isn’t my business.

480
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:43,100
You can fool anyone

481
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:45,440
but your heart.

482
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:46,490
Oh, wait.

483
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:48,140
You can’t fool me either.

484
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:50,480
I can clearly see you still like Mew.

485
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:53,700
Why the hell are you bringing this up?

486
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:56,060
I feel pity for you.

487
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:58,650
Your life is so damn dramatic.

488
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:02,440
You have a secret crush on your friend and can’t tell him.

489
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:06,260
So you pretend to be happy when seeing him with his boyfriend.

490
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:09,210
Damn! Tilly Birds should write a song about you.

491
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,200
Come on, Ray.

492
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:17,600
Are you really going to hide your feelings?

493
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,120
I know Top very well.

494
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:23,400
I want to warn Mew but look,

495
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:25,990
he won’t listen to me now.

496
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:30,070
Once they sleep together, Mew will be dumped immediately.

497
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:35,800
In the end, you will be just a side character who comes in and comforts him.

498
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,430
Do you really want that?

499
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:41,830
You still have a chance now.

500
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,030
Do whatever you have to do.

501
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:57,930
[Seriously, I got him first. I have the right.]

502
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,350
A drink for your boyfriend?

503
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:06,430
Um.

504
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:08,000
Don’t let him drink too much.

505
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,300
He’s a lightweight. He might throw up.

506
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,760
Just let him have fun.

507
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:14,320
I can take care of him if he’s drunk.

508
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:21,420
Ton.

509
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:23,210
I’m going to see Mew.

510
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:24,010
Why are you blocking my way?

511
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:28,530
I just want to tell you something that you should know.

512
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:29,980
What are you talking about?

513
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:34,350
I know you’re so into Mew right now.

514
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:37,930
But do you honestly think you’re the only one he’s into?

515
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:40,710
What are you getting at?

516
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:47,490
I bet you can tell that Mew and Ray aren’t just friends.

517
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,290
I have more.

518
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:02,280
But you can see it later.

519
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,100
If you really do, why don’t you just show it to me right now?

520
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:07,310
Do it.

521
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,470
No.

522
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:10,190
I don’t want you to make a scene.

523
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,860
Just enjoy the party.

524
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:14,610
I’ll text you once it’s over.

525
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:16,720
See you in the parking lot.

526
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,280
Thank you so much for coming.

527
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:30,950
Did you have fun?

528
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:35,360
If you did, please share photos of this place online.

529
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,040
Of course.

530
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,120
And please tag us in your post.

531
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,760
Don’t forget to say this hostel is opening at the beginning of next year.

532
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,810
Okay. No problem.

533
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:45,420
Using #OnlyFriendsStay.

534
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,180
Please don’t forget.

535
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,500
Thank you so much for coming.

536
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,520
Goodnight.

537
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,980
Bye-bye.

538
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,780
See you.

539
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,820
Can you go home by yourself?

540
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,680
I’m helping my friends clean up.

541
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,620
I can.

542
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,640
No problem.

543
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:03,710
Are you sure?

544
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:05,670
I’m worried about you.

545
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:08,090
Don’t worry.

546
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:09,300
I’m a grownup.

547
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,530
No one dares to hurt me.

548
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,750
Look at my face.

549
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:16,480
Okay then.

550
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,200
Sorry.

551
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:18,360
Bye-bye.

552
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:20,370
See you.

553
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:20,970
Um.

554
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:47,780
Go for it.

555
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:50,460
You’ve been checking him out all night.

556
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:55,950
And I think he seems to be interested in you too.

557
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,110
Yeah?

558
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,950
I’m rooting for you.

559
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:05,630
Get him.

560
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,210
And you can finally get rid of your loneliness.

561
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:13,440
I want you to be happy.

562
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:19,500
Are you blushing?

563
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,220
Mew, wanna go home?

564
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:23,270
Not yet.

565
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:25,950
I’m going to help Ray clean up first.

566
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,390
He doesn’t want to go. Don’t make him.

567
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:30,720
Oh, I’m sorry.

568
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:32,930
I’m just taking my boyfriend home.

569
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,440
But I want my friend to stay.

570
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:37,040
Please.

571
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:39,530
There’s no need to fight, guys.

572
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:42,770
You still have a bunch of friends here at the party.

573
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:44,110
But Mew has only one boyfriend.

574
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,320
Come on. Let’s go.

575
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:15,640
Hey, Sand.

576
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,550
You didn’t ride your bike here?

577
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:21,830
No.

578
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,800
It broke down. I sent it to the garage.

579
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,330
I called a ride already.

580
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,170
I’ll keep you company.

581
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:32,000
Thanks so much for today.

582
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,820
The guests were having fun.

583
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:36,830
That’s alright.

584
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:38,550
It’s my duty.

585
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:41,830
What happened to you though?

586
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:42,750
You didn’t seem to enjoy it.

587
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:44,590
It’s your own party.

588
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,170
This and that.

589
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,310
Just forget it.

590
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:50,720
Let’s talk about it later.

591
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,560
Shit!

592
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:01,230
The driver keeps taking the wrong turn.

593
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:03,600
I’ve been waiting for half an hour.

594
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:05,700
Cancel the booking.

595
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:06,700
I’ll take you home.

596
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,030
That’s alright.

597
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,580
I can wait.

598
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,290
You saved me.

599
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:18,280
It’s my turn to save you.

600
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,240
[You coming?]

601
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:38,330
Thank you so much for taking me home, Top.

602
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:41,920
Taking care of you is on my checklist.

603
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:49,770
Are you drunk and taking advantage of me?

604
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:51,480
Don’t you like it though?

605
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:53,160
I do.

606
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:56,090
You’re cute when you’re a little drunk.

607
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:00,540
[I’ve got something hotter and clearer than that.]

608
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:07,200
Is everything okay?

609
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:10,980
My dad.

610
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,820
He’s probably having a problem at the hotel.

611
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:14,970
You should check it first.

612
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:16,770
Might be something urgent.

613
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:18,520
That’s okay.

614
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:20,040
Let’s go to your room.

615
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,160
Look.

616
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:23,290
You can go to your dad.

617
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:25,560
I’m not that drunk, really.

618
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:31,580
Go see your dad.

619
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:37,770
Get home safe.

620
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,090
You’re just so persistent, Ray.

621
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:54,990
Well, you didn’t say no to me.

622
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:03,490
Enough.

623
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:04,680
I’m going up to my room.

624
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,290
What’s the hurry?

625
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:07,160
Stay with me.

626
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:08,840
Please.

627
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:10,450
Please.

628
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,780
Stop that shitty puppy dog eyes.

629
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,550
Why are you so harsh?

630
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:15,630
I’m fighting back.

631
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,220
Is this what you call friends?

632
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:26,090
What kind of friends don’t stop kissing each other?

633
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,960
Do you kiss Mew and Boston like you kiss me?

634
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:33,030
Why do you need to compare?

635
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:34,730
Don’t define it.

636
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,560
Just enjoy your life.

637
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:40,410
You said you could differentiate between love and lust.

638
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:42,870
Honestly.

639
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:47,490
I’ve never slept with anyone who’s not my lover more than once.

640
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:51,060
So do I need to be your lover to get more?

641
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:52,660
Damn you.

642
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:53,330
No.

643
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:55,630
I’ll never take someone like you as my boyfriend.

644
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:58,580
Can’t you just make an exception for me?

645
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:00,110
Hm?

646
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:03,670
Please.

647
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,460
You just don’t take no for an answer, do you, Ray?

648
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,170
You really have to take that now?

649
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,190
It’s urgent.

650
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:51,620
One sec.

651
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:54,710
Hello.

652
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:57,270
Hello, Ray.

653
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,310
Yes.

654
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:01,540
(I lost my key. It’s nowhere to be found.)

655
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:04,960
Can I crash at your house?

656
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:08,660
Sure you can.

657
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:09,770
Where are you? I’m coming.

658
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:11,690
My room.

659
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:13,370
Okay.

660
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,670
What’s happening?

661
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,380
My friend lost his room key.

662
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:24,150
He doesn’t have a place to crash.

663
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:25,430
I’m going to get him.

664
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:31,600
Are you upset?

665
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:32,850
I’m sorry.

666
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:34,650
Let’s take a raincheck.

667
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,140
I’m not.

668
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:38,360
I don’t have the right to be upset with you.

669
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:43,840
Besides, I think it’s a good idea if we just stop at a one-night stand like before.

670
00:41:57,450 --> 00:41:58,910
You finally came.

671
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:00,130
You acted like you didn’t want to.

672
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:02,990
Say what you want.

673
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:04,450
What shit did you send me?

674
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,770
Do you really not know

675
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:08,350
who is in the picture?

676
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,650
I do.

677
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:12,930
I just want to have a clear look at it.

678
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:15,500
Stop beating around the bush and show it to me.

679
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:18,590
Not only the picture that I have.

680
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:20,670
I also have the video.

681
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,110
Take a look.

682
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:38,540
I told you Mew isn’t as naive as you think he is.

683
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:40,740
He’s playing a game with you too.

684
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:42,700
He knows you want him.

685
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:47,270
So he’s playing a hard-to-get virgin to make you want him more.

686
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,490
How old is this video?

687
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,940
It’s two years ago.

688
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:01,670
But who knows?

689
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,060
They might have done it again.

690
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:05,200
Right?

691
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,560
Or maybe

692
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:10,420
he’s dating you just to mess with Ray’s head.

693
00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:14,990
So…

694
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:17,820
if you’re gonna do anything with me now,

695
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,100
it won’t be wrong.

696
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:22,420
Right?

697
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:24,910
If Mew can do it,

698
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:27,220
you can do it too.

699
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:30,970
Don’t wait for him.

700
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:36,680
I’m better anyway.

701
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:31,810
Directed by
Pinya Chookamsri & Tichakorn Phukhaotong

702
00:44:37,370 --> 00:44:39,820
What if people ask what we are to each other?

703
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:40,770
What should I say?

704
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:44,730
You can call our relationship whatever you like.

705
00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:46,370
Okay?

706
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:53,700
Are we good now?

707
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:55,730
We are.

708
00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:09,830
[If he loves you, he loves you. You don’t need to do anything.]
[If he doesn’t, no matter how many times you sleep with him, you’re just his sex doll.]

709
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:17,350
What if I want to be more than just a friend?

710
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:20,010
Does Ray like you, Mew?

711
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,820
Don’t do this to anyone.

712
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:25,050
People have feelings, you know?

713
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:28,690
I care about your feelings. That’s why I’m here.

714
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:33,030
It’s clear that you just can’t take care of what you have.

715
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:35,080
You son of a bitch!

716
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:36,400
I bugged his car.

717
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,280
I heard them doing it.

718
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:41,230
What are you doing?

719
00:45:43,970 --> 00:45:45,120
I’ll sleep with you.

720
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:47,230
Okay?
