1
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,140
I told you Mew isn’t as naive as you think he is.

2
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,860
Who knows?

3
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:13,880
He’s probably dating you just to mess with Ray’s head.

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,960
Don’t wait for him.

5
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:17,860
I’m better anyway.

6
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,100
You really have to take that now?

7
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,240
It’s urgent.

8
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:34,140
Hello, Ray.

9
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:34,800
Yes.

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,510
(I lost my key. It’s nowhere to be found.)

11
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:39,150
Can I crash at your house?

12
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:39,980
Sure you can.

13
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:41,340
Where are you? I’m coming.

14
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,930
Everybody has an emergency contact.

15
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,200
Someone to call when we need urgent assistance.

16
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,480
That person can be a lover, a sibling, or a family member.

17
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,280
But for someone who doesn’t have any of those,

18
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:16,040
my emergency contact is Mew.

19
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:23,280
Hello, Mew.

20
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:25,390
What are you doing?

21
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,720
(Are you drunk again?)

22
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,570
(I'm not picking you up this time.)

23
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,510
No. I’m home.

24
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,480
I just called to tell you that…

25
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,070
I love you.

26
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:44,620
(You’re drunk and talking nonsense.)

27
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,480
Thanks for being a good friend to me

28
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,810
and always taking care of me.

29
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,290
If I’m gone,

30
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,350
I won’t be anyone’s burden anymore, right?

31
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,560
You…

32
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,860
Take good care of yourself.

33
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,380
(Ray.)

34
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,100
(Ray.)

35
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,630
(Hello.)

36
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:23,840
(Ray!)

37
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:52,750
Ray.

38
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,530
Ray.

39
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:00,900
Ray!

40
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:04,820
Ray.

41
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,940
Ray!

42
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,700
What the hell are you doing?

43
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,210
You’re here?

44
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,360
What pills did you take?

45
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,290
Ray.

46
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,370
Ray.

47
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,870
No one loves me.

48
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,180
I’m all alone.

49
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,120
Everyone hates me.

50
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,650
My mom never loved me.

51
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:44,270
Her life was ruined because of me.

52
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:46,990
She died because of me.

53
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:52,480
She never hugged me like this, you know?

54
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:59,030
I’m bad luck, Mew.

55
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:01,370
No one loves me!

56
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:02,440
Your friends!

57
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,230
Your friends, Ray.

58
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,320
They love you.

59
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,390
I love you too.

60
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:11,180
I love you, Ray.

61
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,670
I’ll never abandon you.

62
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,820
You’ll stay with me, right?

63
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,600
Screw those who don’t love you.

64
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,860
I do, Ray.

65
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:34,730
If I wasn’t a lesbian, I’d hit on you already.

66
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,980
You’re damn perfect.

67
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:43,610
You can either be cute or hot.

68
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:46,590
And you’re crazy rich. Damn it.

69
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:48,930
You just spilled your drink.

70
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:50,510
Cheum.

71
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,010
Cheum.

72
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,010
You totally overlook me.

73
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,720
I’m with hotness, cuteness,

74
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:58,660
and sexiness on top of everything.

75
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:00,830
Yuck!

76
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,350
Hell no, you jerk.

77
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,190
Whoever has you as their boyfriend is so unlucky.

78
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,580
You’re slutty.

79
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,950
What about Mew?

80
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,950
Don’t drag me into this.

81
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,300
Mew?

82
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:13,910
Too unseasoned.

83
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,550
I don’t like him.

84
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,830
Not my type.

85
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,830
So, Ray is my number one.

86
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,040
Come on.

87
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,540
- Give me a kiss.
- Cheum!

88
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,870
- Cheum!
- Kiss, kiss.

89
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:27,770
Just go to bed.

90
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:28,840
You’re drunk.

91
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,880
Come on, Cheum. Let’s go.

92
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,450
It’s okay, Mew. I’ll take her there.

93
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,450
I’m gonna go grab my camera too.

94
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:37,470
Let’s move, Cheum.

95
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,150
Go to your room.

96
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,780
Walk steadily, Cheum.

97
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,020
Cheum!

98
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:50,870
Ray, slow down.

99
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,150
How many bottles already?

100
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,860
Keep drinking and you’ll die.

101
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:55,820
This is nothing.

102
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,330
You know I’m a heavyweight.

103
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:09,460
Thanks a lot, Mew, for saving me that night.

104
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:15,070
If it wasn’t for you, I’d have been with my mom already.

105
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:26,390
Do you think I’ll be like her?

106
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,160
Come on, Ray.

107
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:36,280
No,

108
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:39,090
if you quit drinking now.

109
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:41,860
You must take better care of yourself.

110
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:44,440
I’m always right by your side.

111
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:50,980
Thanks, Mew.

112
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:55,670
Remember this.

113
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,480
If you’re in trouble or something bad happens to you,

114
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,270
give me a call.

115
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,810
I’ll go and save you just like you saved me.

116
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:11,880
You’re welcome.

117
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,310
Friends take care of friends.

118
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,980
What if I want to be more than just a friend?

119
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:30,840
What now?

120
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,270
You said beer couldn’t get you drunk.

121
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,050
I’m not drunk.

122
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:38,210
I’m serious, Mew.

123
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,850
If there’s someone who can make me smile again,

124
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,130
it’s you.

125
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,080
I like you, Mew.

126
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,820
Do you like me?

127
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:36,790
Directed by    Pinya Chookamsri & Tichakorn Phukhaotong

128
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:39,770
Crap.

129
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,340
I have no clue where I left my key.

130
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:44,480
Thank you.

131
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,170
No problem.

132
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:49,530
You can crash at my home anytime you want.

133
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,520
What about Top?

134
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,070
I called.

135
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,050
He didn’t pick up.

136
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:00,090
He said he’d deal with stuff with his father at the hotel.

137
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,860
I’m a substitute then.

138
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,540
When you’re with him, you forget about me.

139
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:11,220
There, there.

140
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:13,470
Don’t be sulky.

141
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:16,330
You are my most beloved friend.

142
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:17,590
Huh?

143
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:30,800
Is this yours?

144
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:34,310
Poor boy, seriously?

145
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,880
How dare you wear this?

146
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,830
Hey, Ray.

147
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,130
Why don't you hit on Sand?

148
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:57,110
I think he’s lovely.

149
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:59,240
Besides,

150
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:01,820
I want you to have a boyfriend.

151
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:07,860
Dating a musician is freakin’ cool.

152
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,390
No.

153
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,420
I don’t want to be in a relationship just yet.

154
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,300
Besides, Sand isn’t my type.

155
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:25,530
Don’t set your standard too high.

156
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:30,110
Just date someone who loves and takes care of you.

157
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:34,290
Don’t be so picky like me.

158
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:35,040
Trust me.

159
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,010
Hey!

160
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,120
Ray.

161
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,280
Mew, I…

162
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,600
I’m sorry.

163
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,430
I’m still in love with you.

164
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:46,990
I told you.

165
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:51,100
You and I can be only friends.

166
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:56,560
Whatever I felt about you when we first met remains the same today.

167
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,960
If you still want to be my friend, don’t do this.

168
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,930
I don’t like it.

169
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,960
Lie down here and think

170
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:24,030
whether it is right or not to kiss me while I am asleep.

171
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:29,770
I’ll sleep outside.

172
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,320
Mew.

173
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,240
Holy shit!

174
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,870
What’s the matter?

175
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,280
Found a lizard in your room?

176
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,950
No.

177
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:54,110
I just broke my guitar string.

178
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,820
It’s your beloved item.

179
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,400
Be gentle with it.

180
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,660
Be calm.

181
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:04,700
It’s alright though.

182
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,470
I’m about to change the strings anyway.

183
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,240
Yeah.

184
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,610
Where did you go last night?

185
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,520
I didn’t see you at the party.

186
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,670
You weren’t here when I came back.

187
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,860
Ah, last night…

188
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:21,530
I forgot something at the shop. I went there to get it.

189
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,720
Can I ask you something?

190
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,270
If we feel upset with someone,

191
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:35,180
does it mean we like them already?

192
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:42,800
Um…

193
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,190
Probably.

194
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,690
It can be the start of some kind of feeling.

195
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,290
Why are you asking?

196
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,010
Who are you upset with?

197
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:55,840
Huh?

198
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,550
Do you have a crush on someone?

199
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:59,600
Tell me.

200
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,490
Come on.

201
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,950
Do you?

202
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:05,240
I’ll let you know when I’m ready.

203
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,900
Do tell.

204
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,130
Let’s talk about you instead.

205
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:09,750
What’s with you and Boston?

206
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,590
I know you guys aren’t just friends.

207
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:16,940
We are.

208
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:19,010
We just hit it off. He’s fun to talk to.

209
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,370
Fun to talk to?

210
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:24,380
What do you use to talk? Right here?

211
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,590
You asshole.

212
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,800
No.

213
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,300
Yes.

214
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:27,800
No.

215
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,320
You sure?

216
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:28,940
I am.

217
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:29,570
Really?

218
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:30,540
Yes.

219
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,150
Talking just for fun?

220
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,180
Yes. Get off me.

221
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,860
It’s nothing.

222
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,680
Alright. It’s fine if you don’t want to admit it.

223
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,450
But be careful.

224
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:41,470
Boston is notorious.

225
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:42,860
He has a bad reputation.

226
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,030
I know.

227
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:47,810
It’s fine.

228
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,460
I know what I’m playing with.

229
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,080
Hi.

230
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:10,340
Hello.

231
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,080
Try to get used to this.

232
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:20,150
The hotel heir's boyfriend will have to pay frequent visits.

233
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,550
This is for study purposes.

234
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,400
I’m not here as your boyfriend.

235
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,050
Hey.

236
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,420
Your hotel has a photo booth?

237
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:44,650
Yes.

238
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:47,230
One way to impress the guests.

239
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,970
They have pictures as souvenirs.

240
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:51,880
People don’t dispose of this kind of thing.

241
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,860
So my hotel brand stays in their houses forever.

242
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:55,820
Was it your idea?

243
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:02,160
Come on.

244
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,160
Let’s take some photos.

245
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,910
So we can keep them.

246
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,710
Hey!

247
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,120
Whoa!

248
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:29,530
Make yourself at home, Mew.

249
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:37,620
It’s a huge room with a gorgeous view.

250
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:40,220
I would never leave this room.

251
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:41,760
No.

252
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,820
It’s huge, yes.

253
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,340
But when you stay alone, you can’t help but feel lonely.

254
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:48,440
What did you do when you felt lonely then?

255
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:50,790
Asked people to sleep with you here?

256
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,470
Sometimes. I was single after all.

257
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,350
It was fun at first.

258
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,020
But in the long term, I felt bored.

259
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:59,390
I now want someone I can hug to sleep every night.

260
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:03,100
And I think I found him.

261
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,690
I’ve got a question.

262
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,520
Ask away.

263
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,620
How many people have you slept with?

264
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:15,020
No idea.

265
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,060
I never counted.

266
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,650
Sounds like a lot, right?

267
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:19,630
Come on.

268
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,460
Not that many.

269
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:23,860
Why are you asking though?

270
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:26,870
I don’t know.

271
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,860
I feel like I’m too naive for you.

272
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,240
You might like someone with more experience.

273
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,370
No, Mew.

274
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,210
It’s already nice the way you are.

275
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,880
Don’t be too clever.

276
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,030
Or you’d be able to read me inside out.

277
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,310
What did you just say?

278
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,830
I’m joking.

279
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:47,770
I just wanted to say that you’re already cute the way you are.

280
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:51,600
Your innocence is your charm, Mew.

281
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:57,200
Hey!

282
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:59,470
That’s the younger version of you?

283
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,070
Yes.

284
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:02,660
How did I look?

285
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,500
Hot?

286
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,410
You shouldn’t have grown up.

287
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,570
What is this plane model with the letter B?

288
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:18,780
Ah.

289
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,100
It must be the airline's name.

290
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,410
A friend gave it to me.

291
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,070
Hello.

292
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,590
That bad?

293
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,580
Take action right away before it causes us problems.

294
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:47,800
Yes.

295
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,240
Do as you just said.

296
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,460
Ray!

297
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:04,900
What the heck are you doing?

298
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,700
Where are you going? I can take you.

299
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,340
How much is your service, sir?

300
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,460
Will 1,000 baht cover?

301
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:15,860
Here.

302
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,180
You may go, sir.

303
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,220
Thank you.

304
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,620
What are you doing?

305
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,660
Where are you headed?

306
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,780
To fix my guitar.

307
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,020
And you’re wasting my time.

308
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:34,500
I will take you.

309
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,020
You didn’t respond to my messages.

310
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,060
What’s wrong?

311
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,260
Are you upset with me?

312
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,380
Why would I be?

313
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,060
It’s your business whoever you want to meet.

314
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,100
See? You’re clearly upset.

315
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,180
Can I be your personal chauffeur for a day?

316
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:55,260
To compensate for last night that I bailed on you.

317
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,060
Don’t.

318
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:57,940
I don't feel anything about it.

319
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,860
Hey, Sand.

320
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,100
You don’t but I do.

321
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:09,780
Please.

322
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,740
I’ll drive you the whole day.

323
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,220
Please.

324
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:15,740
Please, please.

325
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:19,580
Please.

326
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,620
Stop that puppy dog eyes.

327
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,180
Let’s go then.

328
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:51,940
Getting your guitar fixed or buying a new one exactly?

329
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,620
I want a new one too.

330
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:58,500
My guitar is pretty old.

331
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,900
Can I buy you a new guitar?

332
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:05,740
You must stop throwing your money at everything.

333
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:06,980
I’m uncomfortable.

334
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,420
I do want money.

335
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,180
But for me,

336
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:16,500
friendship and love can’t be bought.

337
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:20,900
Look.

338
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,700
I’m sorry.

339
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,300
I feel bad for ditching you last night.

340
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,340
But my friend really needed help.

341
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:40,860
People should know how to prioritize things.

342
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,020
I get that.

343
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,780
Scold me.

344
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,580
Yell at me.

345
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:57,420
You asshole. You dick. You son of a bitch.

346
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,220
All sorts of things you name me.

347
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,020
A burden to society.

348
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:03,660
Yell at me.

349
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,380
Do it.

350
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,060
I don’t want to yell at you.

351
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,100
I just want to tell you this.

352
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,380
Don’t ever do that to anyone.

353
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,220
People have feelings.

354
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:19,580
Stop dragging me around when you feel lonely.

355
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:22,820
Or throwing me away when you don’t need me.

356
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,940
If you still want to be my friend,

357
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,540
care about my feelings.

358
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,660
I do care about your feelings.

359
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,140
That’s why I’m here.

360
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,260
Alright, I know.

361
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,140
Let go now.

362
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,260
I’m testing this guitar.

363
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:10,620
Hey.

364
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,540
I saw a record store nearby.

365
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,140
Will you go there with me?

366
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,700
Please.

367
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,220
What kind of music do you listen to?

368
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,060
Me?

369
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,460
I like those rock bands from England.

370
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:36,980
Arctic Monkeys, Oasis, The Smiths.

371
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:40,940
For older artists, I like Queen, The Beatles, and Johnny Cash.

372
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,700
What about Thai music? Do you listen to that?

373
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:47,780
Of course I do.

374
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,380
I actually listen to all kinds.

375
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,460
I even listen to Kamikaze.

376
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:58,580
But my favorites would be Anatomy Rabbit, HYBS, Selina & Sirinya.

377
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,020
Honestly speaking,

378
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,540
I know none of those.

379
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:09,820
Because you only listen to old Thai music your parents used to put on.

380
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:12,460
Try to open your mind and listen to new bands.

381
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:15,620
My happiness is discovering these new bands.

382
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,140
This is the band I just mentioned.

383
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:27,940
Selina & Sirinya.

384
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,100
You wanna try it?

385
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,500
What do you want?

386
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,340
You didn’t read my messages.

387
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,300
So here I am.

388
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:04,980
Ton,

389
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,500
I’m tired today.

390
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,260
I don’t have the energy to fight you.

391
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:10,420
Tired?

392
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,220
Then you don’t have to do anything.

393
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:14,980
Let me do all the work.

394
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:15,980
What the hell are you doing?

395
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:27,500
Ton.

396
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,020
Ton, let go.

397
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:31,780
Damn it, stop!

398
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:36,100
Us in the car that night was my mistake.

399
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:38,020
It must stop already.

400
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,940
To be frank, I still like Mew.

401
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:45,100
Even though he and Ray are messing with your head?

402
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,940
Wake up.

403
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,340
Who is messing with my head exactly?

404
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:52,180
Aren’t you the one betraying your friend?

405
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,380
What do you really want?

406
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,620
Are you envious of Mew?

407
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:00,500
Why would someone like me be envious of Mew?

408
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:04,780
You lost face because I chose Mew.

409
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:08,820
You feel like you’re superior to him.

410
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:13,580
You just can’t stand the fact that I don’t want you anymore.

411
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:18,460
I think what you’re doing right now is so worthless.

412
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,260
What are you doing?

413
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,060
Taking a selfie.

414
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:00,980
Why?

415
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,420
Are you afraid people will know I’m in your room?

416
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:04,940
No.

417
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,620
Take it all you want. I don’t mind.

418
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,740
Then…

419
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,500
Take it with me.

420
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,260
I can’t.

421
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:22,740
You know that my father is planning to run for House Representative.

422
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:25,780
If this photo is out, he will look bad.

423
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,540
I just don’t want any problem.

424
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,140
You don’t trust me.

425
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,180
You think I’ll share it?

426
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,260
It’s not that.

427
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:38,980
But it’s better if there’s no photo at all.

428
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:52,740
There, there.

429
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,980
We don’t need photos.

430
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:02,700
Whenever you miss me, come see me.

431
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:07,060
You’re always welcome here.

432
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:12,620
As long as you’re nice and lovely like this.

433
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:28,980
Stop it.

434
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:31,700
Go get dressed.

435
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:39,780
Go get dressed.

436
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,340
Alright.

437
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,340
[I’m Nick.]

438
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,460
[Can we meet up?]

439
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,980
[I want to talk to you about Boston.]

440
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:51,860
Can I use friendly language?

441
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,500
By all means.

442
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:58,820
Okay.

443
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,020
I’ll cut to the point.

444
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,540
I know about you and Boston.

445
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:08,740
Know what?

446
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:12,820
I know that you guys slept together.

447
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,260
And did it again the night of the party.

448
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,500
How did you know it?

449
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,900
Let’s just say I know.

450
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:35,380
In the car, rainy night, right?

451
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,420
Are you threatening me?

452
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,500
Do you want to tell Mew?

453
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:46,340
Or do you want money?

454
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:49,260
No, I don’t want money.

455
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,860
If not money, what is it then?

456
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,380
You must want something.

457
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,420
Can you stay away from Boston?

458
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:05,620
Why?

459
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,420
You like him?

460
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:24,220
You don't have to call me out if this is what you want.

461
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:27,100
I already told him to leave me alone the other day.

462
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:30,260
I think you should talk to him rather than me.

463
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,180
I know it’s not my place.

464
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:54,300
But don’t get serious with someone like Ton.

465
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,380
He’s nasty.

466
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:03,820
I know.

467
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,100
I am too.

468
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:13,300
By doing this, you think you can stop him?

469
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,100
You think he will love you?

470
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:46,660
What a shitty driver!

471
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:48,620
Are you okay?

472
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:57,380
Why didn’t you look carefully when reversing your car?

473
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,700
I just got my bike fixed.

474
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:00,860
I’m sorry.

475
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,540
But you were going too fast too.

476
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:05,300
I was about to leave the spot.

477
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:06,460
You dick.

478
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,460
It’s your fault and you’re blaming it on me?

479
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,620
You’re the one that should’ve been more careful.

480
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:13,620
Just because you drive an expensive car doesn’t mean you’re allowed to be a shitty driver.

481
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,300
I’m not a shitty driver.

482
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,180
You’re the one who didn’t slow down.

483
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:20,100
You must watch it when other people come off stronger.

484
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,380
What do you mean, you prick?

485
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:23,940
Are you gonna take responsibility for this?

486
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:25,980
Why should I?

487
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,020
It’s not my fault.

488
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:30,220
And what was it? You just got your bike fixed?

489
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:34,340
It’s clear that you just can’t take care of what you have.

490
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,700
You son of a bitch.

491
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,100
Motherf*cker.

492
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:42,740
Damn it.

493
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,100
Hey, Sand!

494
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,500
What a dick!

495
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:48,420
Easy, man.

496
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,420
Calm down.

497
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,500
What happened?

498
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,940
This prick hit me with his car and is not taking responsibility.

499
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:53,740
What the f*ck are you talking about?

500
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:55,380
- Oh, bring it on.
- Top!

501
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:56,780
Stop.

502
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,300
Top, please leave.

503
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,460
Are you okay?

504
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:17,020
I am.

505
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,220
You know him?

506
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,100
Shit. What a small world.

507
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,100
Two assholes know each other.

508
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,820
How did you know he hooked up with Boston?

509
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:43,020
Could you not tell anyone if I told you?

510
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:45,180
Otherwise, I’d be in trouble.

511
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,060
Alright.

512
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:58,460
I bugged his car and heard them doing it.

513
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,100
Boston’s car.

514
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,380
Holy crap.

515
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,500
Why did you do it?

516
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,260
I like Boston.

517
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:50,140
I just feel like someone like me is nothing compared to Top.

518
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:57,260
I feel you.

519
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:58,980
I’ve been through that.

520
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:01,740
How?

521
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,940
Top stole my ex.

522
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,660
Why didn’t you call first?

523
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,220
You wouldn’t let me come here if I did.

524
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,380
Can I talk to you?

525
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:40,580
Only briefly.

526
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:41,300
Top is coming.

527
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,460
Say whatever you need to say.

528
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:12,140
About kissing you when you were asleep,

529
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,300
I'm sorry.

530
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:20,820
I know it's wrong, whether it’s you or anyone else.

531
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,300
I should have asked for permission first.

532
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,300
I'm sorry.

533
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:40,820
You know it well.

534
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:42,940
Why did you do it?

535
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,300
Alright. Just forget it.

536
00:39:53,980 --> 00:40:00,020
Let's just say if you still want me in your life, stop thinking of me that way.

537
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:07,660
Can I ask you something?

538
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:14,300
Is Top the type of boyfriend that you want?

539
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:18,660
Why would you ask that?

540
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:20,780
This is my life. I make my own decisions.

541
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:41,540
Top.

542
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:43,660
What happened to your face?

543
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:45,980
Nothing.

544
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:48,140
Just a little accident and fight.

545
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,500
Who punched you?

546
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,380
I'd love to give him a trophy.

547
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:56,780
Goodbye, Mew.

548
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:09,860
Why was he here?

549
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:24,780
Does Ray like you, Mew?

550
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:33,420
I don't want to keep secrets from you.

551
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:35,980
I'll tell you everything.

552
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:38,740
So you must tell me everything as well.

553
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:40,580
Of course.

554
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:42,820
I have nothing to hide.

555
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:46,580
Yes.

556
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:49,660
Ray likes me.

557
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:54,900
And we kissed once.

558
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:01,100
Ray.

559
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,460
I can't do this.

560
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:13,060
It was just a kiss.

561
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:15,620
Even though it's my first kiss.

562
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:17,340
To me, Ray is just a friend.

563
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:20,460
There's no way I think of him more than that.

564
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:22,180
Just a kiss?

565
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:25,460
Nothing more happened?

566
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:28,660
Top.

567
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:31,980
Why would you ask me that?

568
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,300
Did you not believe that I have never slept with anyone?

569
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:38,620
I can't hook up with my friend.

570
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:53,220
Nothing, it is.

571
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:55,700
I'm sorry, Mew.

572
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:05,380
It's your turn now.

573
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:10,300
That plane model with the letter B, who bought it for you?

574
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:13,020
Was it Beam?

575
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:16,180
So you are worried about Beam?

576
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:18,500
That's right.

577
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:21,500
You didn't introduce me as your boyfriend.

578
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:23,900
And he completely ignored me.

579
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:29,420
Beam is a drug dealer.

580
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:42,820
You mean like coke and stuff?

581
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:45,620
Um.

582
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:51,220
Why?

583
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:52,380
Are you not okay with that?

584
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:56,380
No.

585
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:57,940
I just don't like it.

586
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:00,060
Ray uses it too.

587
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,140
And I keep telling him to quit.

588
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:06,980
If I'm going to have a boyfriend, I wouldn't want a drug user.

589
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:08,900
But I'm not an addict.

590
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:10,900
I just have fun with my friends sometimes.

591
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:12,780
I'm fully aware of what I'm doing.

592
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:16,420
No one says they are an addict until their life is ruined, Top.

593
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:21,420
What now?

594
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:23,380
Do you want me to quit?

595
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:26,980
It's your life.

596
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:30,020
Not my concern.

597
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:32,500
And what if I quit?

598
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:34,540
What would I get?

599
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:37,580
Do you need to get anything?

600
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:40,940
Isn't it already good for you if you quit?

601
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:46,540
If I quit it for you,

602
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:51,380
don't you think I should get something as a reward?

603
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:57,500
Sure.

604
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:02,660
If you quit using drugs,

605
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:07,660
I'll sleep with you.

606
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:09,600
Okay?

607
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:06,920
No penetration.

608
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:09,400
Come on.

609
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,400
Are you cheating?

610
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:13,400
Take it or leave it.

611
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:20,000
The plane model with the letter B belonged to my ex named Boeing.

612
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:21,560
It doesn't mean anything.

613
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:25,680
Your favorite ex?

614
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:29,960
Just someone from the past.

615
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,040
I have only you now.

616
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,200
I'm willing to do anything for you.

617
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:31,400
Hey.

618
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:33,840
How was that?

619
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:35,720
Okay.

620
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:43,680
What do you mean by okay?

621
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:45,240
Just okay?

622
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:53,120
Okay means it was good.

623
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:03,800
I can't remember the last time I cared about the feelings of someone I slept with.

624
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:05,920
What do you mean?

625
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,720
If I tell you, please don't hate on me.

626
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:14,800
I can't guarantee that yet.

627
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:16,320
Just tell me first.

628
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:22,680
Back then when I had sex with someone, all I cared about was whether I came or not.

629
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:24,160
Whether or not I was happy.

630
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:29,560
But with you, I don't really care about that stuff.

631
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,400
I'm glad to hear that.

632
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:35,480
I won't hate on you.

633
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:40,320
But wasn't that a little too selfish of you?

634
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:43,800
It was. I know.

635
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:47,080
When something came easy, I didn't really care about it.

636
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:47,920
Wow!

637
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,040
The attitude of a top-tier.

638
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:51,920
I'm not okay with that.

639
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:56,000
But I'm not like that anymore.

640
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,480
You make me want to be a better person.

641
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:07,560
From now on, I promise I will prioritize your feelings and your happiness.

642
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:13,120
Hey.

643
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:15,200
What is this?

644
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:16,520
Kissing a top-tier.

645
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,200
Why? Can't I?

646
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:20,360
Top, stop it.

647
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,320
I found it in a gift shop.

648
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,080
I think it matches your name.

649
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:38,640
You're Ray.

650
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,320
You are the brightness.

651
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:43,040
You are a ray of sunshine.

652
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:45,840
You should be hot and lively.

653
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,800
You shouldn't be sad like this, my friend.

654
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:01,360
Don't you think I'm too hot for people to handle?

655
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:06,480
A lot of people love hotness.

656
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:08,480
You'll be fine.

657
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:16,120
Mew is my emergency contact.

658
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:20,840
And I had always thought that I’d been his too.

659
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:23,320
But right now,

660
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:26,720
I don't think I'm that important to him anymore.

661
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:41,000
Just try.

662
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:42,440
I think you might like it.

663
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,720
Let music do the work.

664
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:28,880
♪ If this is the only place with starlights ♪

665
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:36,240
♪ If this is the only place with moonshine ♪

666
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:38,080
Do you like it?

667
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:45,320
♪ If this is the only place with blue sea and sky ♪

668
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:51,200
♪ Nothing else is nearby ♪

669
00:51:56,600 --> 00:52:00,040
♪ If this is the only place that has you ♪

670
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:08,520
♪ If this is the only place with the breeze so cool ♪

671
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:17,600
♪ If this is the only place with trees and a clear stream ♪

672
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:20,560
The song makes me wanna fly to Chiang Mai and sip beer right now.

673
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:22,600
And set up a tent too?

674
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:25,680
I like it.

Directed by
Pinya Chookamsri & Tichakorn Phukhaotong

676
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:06,200
So does it mean I pass my probation?

677
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:09,520
You made me believe that you don’t have anyone else.

678
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:11,200
Hello, Ton.

679
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:13,600
I think I will give it to Top.

680
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:16,160
I don’t want to go to the hostel today.

681
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:17,040
Can I stay with you?

682
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:18,600
I wanna get to know you better.

683
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:22,680
This is my life, rough and dusty.

684
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:24,920
Not like yours, which always stays in the air-filtered air conditioning.

685
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:27,680
I think I should stop sleeping around.

686
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:29,560
I’ve felt empty lately.

687
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:31,840
Ray!
