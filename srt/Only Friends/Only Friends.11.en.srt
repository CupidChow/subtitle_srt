1
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,920
How can I be sure that you will not do shit to me again?

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,974
I will not lie to you, hide anything from you, or cheat on you.

3
00:00:10,974 --> 00:00:13,726
I was talking to Boeing and told him we were wakeboarding.

4
00:00:13,766 --> 00:00:15,040
I hope you don't have a problem with that, Top.

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,856
I missed you so damn much.

6
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:18,863
I missed you so much as well.

7
00:00:18,863 --> 00:00:20,514
Thank you for not leaving me.

8
00:00:20,514 --> 00:00:24,012
All these times we’ve been happy together.
Everything was a lie, right?

9
00:00:24,012 --> 00:00:26,708
Actually, you just want my dad's money.

10
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:29,145
He took the money because I forced him to.

11
00:00:29,145 --> 00:00:31,145
Sand, I’m sorry.

12
00:00:31,145 --> 00:00:34,248
There's no one who's more caring or loving than you.

13
00:00:34,248 --> 00:00:38,148
Ever since you walked into my life, I've been so happy.

14
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:08,167
So?

15
00:01:08,167 --> 00:01:09,290
Drinkable?

16
00:01:10,025 --> 00:01:11,274
It’s quite alright.

17
00:01:11,801 --> 00:01:13,520
Similar to what Plug used to make.

18
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:16,200
Did you really need to compare?

19
00:01:18,326 --> 00:01:19,950
I’m not as good as him.

20
00:01:20,924 --> 00:01:22,011
Cheer up, Yo.

21
00:01:22,371 --> 00:01:23,441
I’m just kidding.

22
00:01:25,611 --> 00:01:26,601
So how is it going?

23
00:01:27,969 --> 00:01:29,100
Don’t you miss him?

24
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:32,490
Of course, I do.

25
00:01:34,357 --> 00:01:35,559
I miss him so much.

26
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:41,152
But I want him to understand that my fear is real.

27
00:01:42,667 --> 00:01:45,672
I’ve never received any good things in life.

28
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:49,458
People only want my money or my body.

29
00:01:49,846 --> 00:01:53,708
Then one day, there’s this man who loves and cares for me

30
00:01:53,708 --> 00:01:56,048
He says he loves who I am.

31
00:01:56,857 --> 00:01:58,552
Don’t I have the right to be scared?

32
00:02:02,085 --> 00:02:04,555
I should protect my heart first, shouldn't I?

33
00:02:09,225 --> 00:02:10,451
I feel you.

34
00:02:12,571 --> 00:02:15,416
But for this kind of thing, we must take the risk.

35
00:02:16,288 --> 00:02:17,912
You might hit the First Prize Lottery.

36
00:02:19,033 --> 00:02:20,188
The First Prize Lottery?

37
00:02:22,097 --> 00:02:26,539
I think my chances of winning the First Prize Lottery are greater than having an ideal boyfriend.

38
00:02:55,182 --> 00:02:56,609
Far too much booze.

39
00:02:57,274 --> 00:02:58,362
You can become drunk with the first sip.

40
00:03:03,495 --> 00:03:08,383
If I'm drunk, will anybody take care of me?

41
00:03:11,801 --> 00:03:12,956
Do you want to be taken care of?

42
00:04:35,288 --> 00:04:36,537
Yes, Mom.

43
00:04:37,648 --> 00:04:39,812
I'll be there and help out one day before the café opens.

44
00:04:40,893 --> 00:04:41,711
Sure.

45
00:04:42,044 --> 00:04:43,214
Just call me if you need anything.

46
00:04:43,645 --> 00:04:44,450
See you.

47
00:04:58,649 --> 00:05:00,062
(Hello. Where are you, Mew?)

48
00:05:01,971 --> 00:05:03,008
I'm at the U.

49
00:05:03,298 --> 00:05:04,426
(Your class is over, right?)

50
00:05:04,786 --> 00:05:05,646
(Wanna grab something to eat?)

51
00:05:07,935 --> 00:05:08,947
Not available.

52
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,699
I'm going to buy some plants with Cheum.

53
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:11,611
What is it?

54
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,250
(Yeah? Can I tag along?)

55
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:16,914
I don't think you should.

56
00:05:17,579 --> 00:05:18,936
I want to spend time with my friend.

57
00:05:19,629 --> 00:05:20,544
Bye now.

58
00:05:20,544 --> 00:05:21,173
(Wait–)

59
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:38,319
[I'm on my way.]

60
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:39,720
[Okay.]

61
00:05:46,874 --> 00:05:47,800
Waiting for Cheum?

62
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:55,140
Or Being?

63
00:06:05,638 --> 00:06:07,638
Seriously, Mew.

64
00:06:09,086 --> 00:06:09,912
What are you doing?

65
00:06:11,657 --> 00:06:12,765
Taking revenge on me?

66
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,876
By hooking up with him?

67
00:06:17,597 --> 00:06:18,540
Do you even know

68
00:06:19,394 --> 00:06:20,322
what you are talking about?

69
00:06:20,322 --> 00:06:21,394
Isn't it true though?

70
00:06:23,366 --> 00:06:24,648
You allowed him in your place.

71
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:26,493
You asked him out for wakeboarding.

72
00:06:27,476 --> 00:06:28,466
And now what?

73
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:31,907
You lied to me so you could hang out with him.

74
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,240
Go on, Mew.

75
00:06:34,391 --> 00:06:37,189
If you're satisfied with what you're doing, go ahead.

76
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:40,320
But I'm telling you I have my limits.

77
00:06:42,064 --> 00:06:43,947
I know what I did was wrong.

78
00:06:44,518 --> 00:06:46,108
But I'm trying to be a better person

79
00:06:47,411 --> 00:06:48,770
because you said you would give me a chance.

80
00:06:52,665 --> 00:06:53,914
But this is not.

81
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,201
If you don't think you can forgive me,

82
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:05,186
we should just separate.

83
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:06,785
Let it end.

84
00:07:08,927 --> 00:07:13,533
That will hurt me more than you sleeping with Boeing.

85
00:07:36,045 --> 00:07:36,880
Are you okay, Nick?

86
00:07:37,806 --> 00:07:38,555
Stressed out?

87
00:07:40,494 --> 00:07:41,317
No, Dan.

88
00:07:41,927 --> 00:07:43,104
Just letting my mind wander.

89
00:07:44,982 --> 00:07:46,113
- Excuse me.
- Oh, sure.

90
00:07:55,708 --> 00:08:00,000
Nick, do you know I’ve never dated younger people?

91
00:08:02,364 --> 00:08:05,800
Whatever you want me to do or be, just let me know.

92
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:12,982
Do you want to be my boyfriend?

93
00:08:14,534 --> 00:08:15,273
Um.

94
00:08:16,206 --> 00:08:17,028
Can I?

95
00:08:17,801 --> 00:08:19,097
Do you like me?

96
00:08:22,814 --> 00:08:23,992
I actually like you.

97
00:08:26,982 --> 00:08:27,844
But…

98
00:08:28,814 --> 00:08:30,572
I'm not sure I'm ready to be anyone's boyfriend.

99
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:34,696
Um.

100
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:39,848
Am I putting too much pressure on you?

101
00:08:40,417 --> 00:08:41,402
No.

102
00:08:42,511 --> 00:08:43,996
Actually, I…

103
00:08:47,917 --> 00:08:48,890
Never mind.

104
00:08:49,223 --> 00:08:52,416
Let's just focus on work.

105
00:09:08,671 --> 00:09:09,640
Just a second, sir.

106
00:09:09,857 --> 00:09:11,035
Thank you.

107
00:09:11,035 --> 00:09:12,995
Hey. Ray.

108
00:09:12,995 --> 00:09:15,257
You came just in time. Get on stage and sing.

109
00:09:15,257 --> 00:09:19,101
That night when you sang, these guys loved it.
The customers went crazy.

110
00:09:19,313 --> 00:09:20,679
I'm afraid not tonight, ma'am.

111
00:09:21,414 --> 00:09:23,040
I came looking for Sand.

112
00:09:23,445 --> 00:09:24,323
Sand?

113
00:09:24,323 --> 00:09:25,703
He came but now he's gone.

114
00:09:26,763 --> 00:09:27,918
Why didn't you call him?

115
00:09:28,084 --> 00:09:29,966
I did.

116
00:09:29,994 --> 00:09:31,336
But his phone isn’t reachable.

117
00:09:31,957 --> 00:09:33,957
He's not at his place or the club he sings.

118
00:09:34,566 --> 00:09:36,402
So I thought he might have come here to see you.

119
00:09:38,766 --> 00:09:39,662
What's wrong?

120
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:42,487
Are you guys having a fight?

121
00:09:48,263 --> 00:09:49,324
Sort of, ma'am.

122
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:54,240
I yelled at him and unintentionally said something harsh to him.

123
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,187
He must be angry with me.

124
00:09:57,767 --> 00:09:59,650
I don't think he wants to see me again.

125
00:10:03,062 --> 00:10:05,602
I won't ask what the fight is all about.

126
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,454
But I'm telling you this.

127
00:10:07,454 --> 00:10:10,280
Sand is a…

128
00:10:11,056 --> 00:10:13,821
super caring kind of person.

129
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:15,511
He pokes his nose in other people's business so much.

130
00:10:15,954 --> 00:10:18,331
I, his mom, sometimes get annoyed by him.

131
00:10:18,472 --> 00:10:20,427
He wants me to quit drinking.

132
00:10:20,427 --> 00:10:22,117
He dragged me to the hospital.

133
00:10:22,117 --> 00:10:24,749
And now he wants me to quit my night job.

134
00:10:25,067 --> 00:10:26,386
He said he would take care of me.

135
00:10:26,551 --> 00:10:29,091
He doesn't even think about how he’s going to manage.

136
00:10:29,091 --> 00:10:30,533
Work and study at the same time.

137
00:10:34,121 --> 00:10:35,933
He does that to me too.

138
00:10:38,516 --> 00:10:40,633
Then it means he cares so much about you.

139
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:46,069
If you think you're wrong, make it up to him.

140
00:10:47,098 --> 00:10:48,253
I'm rooting for you.

141
00:10:50,555 --> 00:10:52,184
I want my son to date someone rich.

142
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:53,259
And I'll leech off him.

143
00:10:59,448 --> 00:11:01,237
And do you know where he might be?

144
00:11:02,898 --> 00:11:04,076
I don't.

145
00:11:06,015 --> 00:11:10,668
He's probably somewhere quiet and drinking all alone.

146
00:11:21,613 --> 00:11:24,341
Hey. Sand.

147
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:26,552
How come you're here alone?

148
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,494
My friend is busy.

149
00:11:33,251 --> 00:11:35,368
You are drinking, huh?

150
00:11:36,608 --> 00:11:39,195
You're still young. Take care of your health.

151
00:11:39,571 --> 00:11:40,457
Will you excuse me?

152
00:11:55,977 --> 00:11:56,568
Sand.

153
00:12:13,947 --> 00:12:14,890
I'm sorry.

154
00:12:27,404 --> 00:12:28,300
I'm sorry.

155
00:12:33,409 --> 00:12:34,282
I'm sorry.

156
00:12:37,595 --> 00:12:39,595
I can’t live without you, Sand.

157
00:12:41,648 --> 00:12:43,155
Me neither.

158
00:13:00,987 --> 00:13:01,570
Jerk.

159
00:13:02,346 --> 00:13:03,733
Stop poking me.

160
00:13:09,094 --> 00:13:11,094
If you want my dad's money back,

161
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,330
I can give it to you.

162
00:13:13,702 --> 00:13:18,308
Honestly, when your dad offered me the money, I hesitated.

163
00:13:19,511 --> 00:13:20,945
But when I got to spend time with you,

164
00:13:22,691 --> 00:13:24,087
I realized something.

165
00:13:26,801 --> 00:13:28,684
I've never cared this much for anyone in a long time.

166
00:13:39,071 --> 00:13:41,165
I don't want you to drink too much.

167
00:13:41,963 --> 00:13:43,963
I want you to get a health check-up every year.

168
00:13:45,082 --> 00:13:46,753
And I don't want you to drive when you're drunk.

169
00:13:50,212 --> 00:13:53,840
Thank you for putting up with my hot temper.

170
00:13:53,957 --> 00:13:55,004
Put up, huh?

171
00:13:55,484 --> 00:13:57,273
Look at your piece of work.

172
00:13:57,479 --> 00:13:58,664
Look.

173
00:13:59,191 --> 00:14:00,301
The bruise.

174
00:14:00,543 --> 00:14:01,714
Sorry.

175
00:14:01,714 --> 00:14:02,778
Does it hurt?

176
00:14:03,161 --> 00:14:04,104
Ouch, it does.

177
00:14:04,104 --> 00:14:06,116
You're overreacting.

178
00:14:06,664 --> 00:14:09,885
Next time, be more calm. Listen first.

179
00:14:10,715 --> 00:14:12,316
Alright, I promise.

180
00:14:13,553 --> 00:14:14,661
You promise.

181
00:14:15,175 --> 00:14:15,813
Um.

182
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:16,747
Ow! It hurts.

183
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:18,737
Don't exaggerate.

184
00:14:32,967 --> 00:14:34,709
You asked me to come. What is it?

185
00:14:41,549 --> 00:14:43,032
I just want to talk about Top.

186
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:45,509
What about him?

187
00:14:46,456 --> 00:14:48,221
Is he having a problem with us talking?

188
00:14:50,029 --> 00:14:50,714
Um.

189
00:14:51,643 --> 00:14:52,876
I knew it.

190
00:14:53,264 --> 00:14:55,223
He also told me to leave you alone.

191
00:14:56,059 --> 00:14:56,816
Yeah?

192
00:14:58,507 --> 00:14:59,445
What did he say?

193
00:15:03,852 --> 00:15:04,795
He's probably jealous.

194
00:15:06,367 --> 00:15:07,475
I guess he's afraid you'd fall for me.

195
00:15:09,612 --> 00:15:12,035
It's good to see him sad once in a while.

196
00:15:12,465 --> 00:15:13,855
He always thinks he's top-tier

197
00:15:14,543 --> 00:15:17,294
and that he can do anything with anyone.

198
00:15:19,428 --> 00:15:20,806
I guess he is taking you for granted.

199
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:23,202
He believes you will eventually give in to him.

200
00:15:24,896 --> 00:15:25,792
Don't think so.

201
00:15:27,467 --> 00:15:30,641
I think I know how to deal with this kind of person.

202
00:15:32,647 --> 00:15:33,880
So you think…

203
00:15:34,074 --> 00:15:35,800
you’ll be his last?

204
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:37,494
Hm?

205
00:15:40,421 --> 00:15:41,576
No, I don't.

206
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,630
I just want to give him a chance.

207
00:15:45,556 --> 00:15:47,800
You're giving a chance to someone who's going to blow it.

208
00:15:48,972 --> 00:15:54,658
After three months, six months, a year,

209
00:15:56,095 --> 00:15:58,095
he's going to be with someone else.

210
00:16:03,902 --> 00:16:05,667
Isn't it better to trust someone else instead?

211
00:16:17,494 --> 00:16:18,954
Can I trust you, Boeing?

212
00:16:25,212 --> 00:16:26,155
Frankly speaking,

213
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:29,400
I don't think you like me that much.

214
00:16:30,176 --> 00:16:31,773
You just want to make him pay, right?

215
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:34,910
He must have hurt you bad.

216
00:16:37,313 --> 00:16:38,855
I get it though.

217
00:16:39,021 --> 00:16:40,324
It’s just awful

218
00:16:41,021 --> 00:16:43,021
to be needed only when he's heartbroken.

219
00:16:43,671 --> 00:16:44,920
And he dumped you in the end.

220
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:47,600
You must have felt so revengeful.

221
00:16:49,604 --> 00:16:54,328
But because of that, I know he wants to be with me again.

222
00:16:58,188 --> 00:17:00,000
I thought you'd be wiser.

223
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:07,813
Not gonna wish you luck.

224
00:17:09,282 --> 00:17:10,736
You guys are not going to make it anyway.

225
00:17:34,156 --> 00:17:36,247
Looking for Atom or your new prey?

226
00:17:37,287 --> 00:17:39,287
They looked at me. I just looked back.

227
00:17:39,446 --> 00:17:40,406
Are you jealous?

228
00:17:41,271 --> 00:17:42,504
I’m not.

229
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:45,587
Don’t look for a new mess when you haven’t cleaned up your old one.

230
00:17:46,472 --> 00:17:48,381
You sleep around too much and things get messy.

231
00:17:49,009 --> 00:17:49,830
Don’t you learn?

232
00:17:51,009 --> 00:17:52,188
Complaining, complaining.

233
00:17:52,897 --> 00:17:53,723
You’re jealous.

234
00:18:05,007 --> 00:18:05,915
There he is.

235
00:18:07,043 --> 00:18:10,590
Ever since I opened his eyes, he found his own taste.

236
00:18:11,528 --> 00:18:13,369
A staff here said he comes very often.

237
00:18:14,054 --> 00:18:15,424
He's out of control.

238
00:18:16,552 --> 00:18:17,182
Hey,

239
00:18:18,118 --> 00:18:19,140
what are you doing?

240
00:18:19,517 --> 00:18:22,609
Punch him in the face for telling people I forced him to sleep with me.

241
00:18:22,609 --> 00:18:23,813
You can't do that.

242
00:18:24,594 --> 00:18:25,934
You think he will confess?

243
00:18:26,419 --> 00:18:28,419
You have his naked photos.

244
00:18:29,092 --> 00:18:30,387
Who would believe you?

245
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,560
For someone who takes photos of people after screwing them,

246
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:38,300
you don't have a very trustworthy profile.

247
00:18:39,865 --> 00:18:40,864
What do you want me to do then?

248
00:18:47,241 --> 00:18:48,877
He wants to attack you, doesn't he?

249
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:54,280
I think we should attack him first.

250
00:19:04,035 --> 00:19:05,729
I saw you sitting alone for a while.

251
00:19:06,821 --> 00:19:07,911
So I wanted to talk to you.

252
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:10,619
Are you expecting someone?

253
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:13,193
Or you just came alone?

254
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:15,809
I came alone.

255
00:19:17,953 --> 00:19:19,271
Me too.

256
00:19:21,001 --> 00:19:21,935
Can I…

257
00:19:23,063 --> 00:19:24,192
talk to you?

258
00:19:26,454 --> 00:19:27,226
Sure.

259
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,298
I'm Nick.

260
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:31,991
I'm Atom.

261
00:19:36,256 --> 00:19:38,006
I think you look familiar.

262
00:19:39,173 --> 00:19:40,117
As if…

263
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:43,141
we met at the Halloween party.

264
00:19:44,315 --> 00:19:45,004
Yeah?

265
00:19:45,756 --> 00:19:47,013
So many people that night.

266
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:48,476
I don't think I saw you.

267
00:19:51,606 --> 00:19:53,106
But I'm sure I recognize you.

268
00:19:56,258 --> 00:19:57,689
You looked so cute that night.

269
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:00,681
Thanks.

270
00:20:02,218 --> 00:20:03,036
Are you dating anyone?

271
00:20:05,809 --> 00:20:06,669
Can I flirt with you?

272
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:11,809
So many questions.

273
00:20:12,534 --> 00:20:13,703
I don't know which one to answer first.

274
00:20:15,272 --> 00:20:18,887
I just like you and want to make a move.

275
00:20:19,842 --> 00:20:20,797
Don't you like it?

276
00:20:22,609 --> 00:20:25,925
Don't you think it's too fast?

277
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,235
I can be even faster than this.

278
00:21:09,989 --> 00:21:10,601
Oh, shit!

279
00:21:18,236 --> 00:21:19,667
What the hell are you doing, Ton?

280
00:21:19,794 --> 00:21:22,340
Taking photos of you hooking up, just like what you told your sister.

281
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,681
Didn't you tell everyone that I tricked you and took your photos?

282
00:21:25,948 --> 00:21:27,572
When in fact, you were the one that asked me to.

283
00:21:27,572 --> 00:21:28,289
Huh?

284
00:21:29,645 --> 00:21:32,691
And I'll post these photos on social media.

285
00:21:33,343 --> 00:21:35,252
Just like you who created your anonymous account to expose me.

286
00:21:35,993 --> 00:21:37,834
If I get exposed, so do you.

287
00:21:38,277 --> 00:21:40,384
Ton, take it easy.

288
00:21:42,624 --> 00:21:43,987
You two assholes know each other?

289
00:21:45,653 --> 00:21:46,525
Sorry, bro.

290
00:21:47,809 --> 00:21:48,964
I was just helping my friend.

291
00:21:51,301 --> 00:21:53,028
What you did was wrong.

292
00:21:54,088 --> 00:21:58,612
Ton never forces anyone to sleep with him, no matter how terrible he is.

293
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:02,011
Just because he doesn't want you,

294
00:22:03,571 --> 00:22:04,911
you don't have to go this far.

295
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:06,923
It can ruin your future.

296
00:22:14,544 --> 00:22:15,813
I'm really sorry, Ton.

297
00:22:16,834 --> 00:22:18,623
But I truly have good feelings for you.

298
00:22:22,491 --> 00:22:24,764
I just want you to love me, just like I love you.

299
00:22:24,764 --> 00:22:25,900
Atom.

300
00:22:26,088 --> 00:22:27,289
Pull yourself together.

301
00:22:28,434 --> 00:22:30,957
How can you love me after sleeping together just once?

302
00:22:31,494 --> 00:22:32,230
Huh?

303
00:22:32,975 --> 00:22:34,588
Just because I'm the first man you slept with?

304
00:22:37,667 --> 00:22:39,667
But you turned me into gay.

305
00:22:39,667 --> 00:22:42,040
Atom, no one can do that.

306
00:22:42,376 --> 00:22:43,989
This is already who you are.

307
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:46,256
You initiated it all that night.

308
00:22:46,256 --> 00:22:47,809
I just helped you realize it.

309
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:49,548
Ton, easy.

310
00:22:49,924 --> 00:22:51,372
It must be something very new for him.

311
00:23:00,722 --> 00:23:01,880
I get you.

312
00:23:03,594 --> 00:23:05,025
I know how painful it is to love someone one-sidedly.

313
00:23:09,329 --> 00:23:11,033
But I don't think you love Ton.

314
00:23:12,102 --> 00:23:14,102
He just happened to walk into your life at the time you're lost.

315
00:23:15,357 --> 00:23:16,902
You will meet someone nice eventually.

316
00:23:18,621 --> 00:23:19,809
Don't fall for an asshole.

317
00:23:22,172 --> 00:23:22,984
Trust me.

318
00:23:38,485 --> 00:23:41,008
Once upon a time,

319
00:23:41,499 --> 00:23:46,229
there was a prince who didn't like to brush his teeth.

320
00:23:47,903 --> 00:23:49,494
Who in this room doesn't like to brush their teeth?

321
00:23:57,624 --> 00:24:02,513
You know, because the prince didn't like to brush his teeth, he had tooth decay.

322
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:03,718
Are you afraid?

323
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:07,089
No.

324
00:24:07,787 --> 00:24:08,708
No?

325
00:24:10,129 --> 00:24:11,037
Sand.

326
00:24:11,777 --> 00:24:13,535
Help.

327
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:14,398
Help me.

328
00:24:16,808 --> 00:24:20,569
Do you know why we should brush our teeth?

329
00:24:21,008 --> 00:24:25,715
Because if we don't, there will be a small bug crawling into our mouth

330
00:24:25,715 --> 00:24:27,566
and it will bite us hard.

331
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:29,189
Ow! It hurts.

332
00:24:29,189 --> 00:24:30,026
Are you scared?

333
00:24:30,238 --> 00:24:33,330
No.

334
00:24:35,232 --> 00:24:36,849
Really? No?

335
00:24:37,086 --> 00:24:46,411
If you have bad teeth, there will be a big bug crawling into your mouth and it will bite you.

336
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:54,164
Are you scared now?

337
00:24:54,268 --> 00:24:56,791
Yes, we are.

338
00:24:57,010 --> 00:25:00,921
Then what do you need to do to avoid that bug?

339
00:25:00,921 --> 00:25:03,540
Brush our teeth.

340
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,568
Good job.

341
00:25:04,568 --> 00:25:06,738
Now show me your teeth.

342
00:25:06,738 --> 00:25:09,286
Hey, what is this right here?

343
00:25:09,819 --> 00:25:10,591
Is it your fang?

344
00:25:13,502 --> 00:25:14,569
Do you have fangs?

345
00:25:14,569 --> 00:25:17,188
Does anyone want to see this big bro's teeth?

346
00:25:18,077 --> 00:25:20,623
Ray, show them your smile.

347
00:25:21,363 --> 00:25:22,329
Come on, grin.

348
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,990
So that's an example of good teeth.

349
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,558
You just did six hours.

350
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:28,158
Your social work will be done next time you come.

351
00:25:28,158 --> 00:25:30,300
Please do nasal irrigation if possible.

352
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:30,800
Sure.

353
00:25:30,911 --> 00:25:32,092
Thank you.

354
00:25:39,257 --> 00:25:42,144
So what do I get from helping you here?

355
00:25:42,482 --> 00:25:45,028
Besides doing what I just did for the kids to watch.

356
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:47,073
That was cute.

357
00:25:47,249 --> 00:25:48,644
You got to be Mr. Big Bug.

358
00:25:50,005 --> 00:25:51,004
Seriously.

359
00:25:51,404 --> 00:25:52,835
I'm effortlessly cute.

360
00:25:52,835 --> 00:25:54,214
I am approachable to people of all ages and genders.

361
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,565
That's true.

362
00:25:58,506 --> 00:25:59,372
But you…

363
00:26:00,849 --> 00:26:02,706
Did you really learn the consequences of drunk driving?

364
00:26:03,909 --> 00:26:06,273
If you hit someone that night,

365
00:26:07,515 --> 00:26:08,901
things would be worse than this.

366
00:26:11,257 --> 00:26:13,780
Alright, Mr. Big Bug.

367
00:26:17,092 --> 00:26:18,068
I know.

368
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:20,177
By the way,

369
00:26:20,795 --> 00:26:23,182
After I'm done with the rehab,

370
00:26:25,127 --> 00:26:26,831
should hit a music festival in some country?

371
00:26:27,618 --> 00:26:29,618
Someplace not too far.

372
00:26:30,316 --> 00:26:31,136
Of course.

373
00:26:31,592 --> 00:26:32,450
How about Japan?

374
00:26:32,748 --> 00:26:35,645
They have Summer Sonic and Fuji Rock.

375
00:26:35,645 --> 00:26:36,659
Let's check out the lineup.

376
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:38,676
Okay.

377
00:26:39,422 --> 00:26:42,082
Actually, I don't really care about the bands.

378
00:26:42,891 --> 00:26:45,915
All I want is to listen to music with you while jumping with arms wrapped around each other's necks.

379
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,640
Then you better complete your rehab.

380
00:26:50,203 --> 00:26:51,734
I'll get my passport issued right now.

381
00:26:52,729 --> 00:26:53,512
Deal.

382
00:27:03,008 --> 00:27:04,257
Where should I put this, Mom?

383
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:06,839
On the top. We want to highlight it.

384
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:07,509
Over here.

385
00:27:08,783 --> 00:27:10,783
Isn't this too much?

386
00:27:10,783 --> 00:27:12,900
I think it looks festive enough.

387
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,022
It might be 'less is more' for other people.

388
00:27:15,022 --> 00:27:17,540
But for me, it must be 'more more more'.

389
00:27:17,773 --> 00:27:21,471
Since we are opening the café around Christmas, we must go full-on to grab people's attention.

390
00:27:21,471 --> 00:27:23,249
- Right?
- Of course.

391
00:27:23,416 --> 00:27:25,129
The only thing we miss here is snow.

392
00:27:25,129 --> 00:27:26,423
Don't tease me.

393
00:27:26,752 --> 00:27:27,810
Let's go check inside.

394
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,548
- I'll leave this to you.
- Sure.

395
00:27:31,391 --> 00:27:33,391
- Make it outstanding.
- Alright.

396
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,263
Let me help.

397
00:27:56,171 --> 00:27:57,443
You didn't tell me you'd come.

398
00:27:58,412 --> 00:27:59,411
You didn't pick up my calls.

399
00:28:00,246 --> 00:28:01,548
I was busy with the hotel.

400
00:28:01,951 --> 00:28:03,528
But I promised your mons I'd come.

401
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:06,929
You're talking to my moms?

402
00:28:07,171 --> 00:28:08,052
Um.

403
00:28:08,625 --> 00:28:10,238
They asked for my contact the last time we met.

404
00:28:13,282 --> 00:28:14,291
Top.

405
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,771
You've arrived.

406
00:28:15,771 --> 00:28:17,237
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hi.

407
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:19,072
Are you tired from driving all the way here?

408
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,050
Right.

409
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:21,052
Not at all.

410
00:28:21,093 --> 00:28:24,164
I promised you that I would come so I must come.

411
00:28:24,164 --> 00:28:25,708
Thanks a lot.

412
00:28:26,031 --> 00:28:28,031
But I can't help but wonder why you didn't come with Mew.

413
00:28:28,978 --> 00:28:30,614
Where are you staying tonight?

414
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:33,714
I booked a hotel in the city.

415
00:28:33,714 --> 00:28:34,567
What?

416
00:28:35,126 --> 00:28:36,762
Why did you stay here tonight?

417
00:28:37,184 --> 00:28:38,529
You can stay in Mew's room.

418
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:42,904
That's alright. I don't want to bother.

419
00:28:42,904 --> 00:28:44,625
I'll help out here and head back.

420
00:28:47,291 --> 00:28:48,267
You can crash here.

421
00:28:48,963 --> 00:28:50,963
Driving back to the city at night is not safe.

422
00:28:52,683 --> 00:28:53,421
Or what?

423
00:28:54,173 --> 00:28:55,435
You can't share a room with me anymore?

424
00:28:55,744 --> 00:28:56,844
Do you have any problem with that?

425
00:28:57,891 --> 00:28:59,006
I don't.

426
00:28:59,328 --> 00:29:00,600
I just prefer to sleep alone.

427
00:29:01,856 --> 00:29:04,447
Alright then. Let's do what you're most at ease with, Top.

428
00:29:04,447 --> 00:29:06,984
But you must join us for dinner.

429
00:29:07,452 --> 00:29:08,358
Absolutely, ma'am.

430
00:29:08,358 --> 00:29:10,395
Okay. We'll go prepare the dinner.

431
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:32,018
You don't have to wash them.

432
00:29:33,124 --> 00:29:34,146
I can do it.

433
00:29:34,737 --> 00:29:36,627
You can go chat with my moms. Here.

434
00:29:37,022 --> 00:29:37,976
That's okay.

435
00:29:38,306 --> 00:29:40,306
It's not a lot. I can handle it.

436
00:29:40,729 --> 00:29:42,729
Here. Let me.

437
00:29:43,766 --> 00:29:45,766
That's alright. I'll do it.

438
00:29:45,766 --> 00:29:47,460
No. Top, let me.

439
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:48,825
Mew, it's okay. Let me handle it.

440
00:29:48,825 --> 00:29:50,089
Just go sit and relax.

441
00:29:56,907 --> 00:29:58,338
I said I'd do it.

442
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,289
Why don't you trust me?

443
00:30:09,254 --> 00:30:10,190
I'm sorry.

444
00:30:11,254 --> 00:30:12,318
I'll buy you a new plate.

445
00:30:12,857 --> 00:30:13,676
That's okay.

446
00:30:14,697 --> 00:30:15,878
I can buy it.

447
00:30:24,478 --> 00:30:25,546
I'm sorry

448
00:30:26,808 --> 00:30:27,996
about Boeing.

449
00:30:31,792 --> 00:30:32,623
It's okay.

450
00:30:33,536 --> 00:30:34,887
Do whatever you want to do.

451
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:38,512
What do you mean by that, Top?

452
00:30:40,189 --> 00:30:46,602
What you're doing proves that you can never forget about what Boston and I did.

453
00:30:48,797 --> 00:30:50,479
How can I forget about it so easily?

454
00:30:51,356 --> 00:30:53,009
Snap the fingers and we're cool?

455
00:30:54,047 --> 00:30:55,380
Then what's the point of getting back together?

456
00:30:55,837 --> 00:30:56,504
Right?

457
00:30:58,011 --> 00:30:59,056
Who knows?

458
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:01,850
One day, you might want to get revenge on me again.

459
00:31:02,565 --> 00:31:04,200
You're paranoid. I'm paranoid.

460
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,657
This cycle will never end.

461
00:31:08,915 --> 00:31:10,392
But we already talked about this.

462
00:31:11,429 --> 00:31:12,792
Can't we just start over?

463
00:31:13,488 --> 00:31:15,488
You asked for a chance and I gave it to you.

464
00:31:16,139 --> 00:31:17,489
Don't you want it anymore?

465
00:31:24,027 --> 00:31:25,322
I don't know anymore, Mew.

466
00:31:49,103 --> 00:31:50,694
Still playing the same guitar?

467
00:31:54,165 --> 00:31:54,930
Boe.

468
00:31:58,421 --> 00:31:59,549
When will you get a new one?

469
00:32:06,542 --> 00:32:07,746
Why are you here?

470
00:32:09,778 --> 00:32:11,118
Why can't I be here?

471
00:32:11,928 --> 00:32:13,814
I used to come here a lot to watch you play.

472
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:20,743
So, have you been well?

473
00:32:24,214 --> 00:32:25,136
I'm alright.

474
00:32:25,834 --> 00:32:27,252
Nothing changes that much.

475
00:32:28,061 --> 00:32:28,844
What about you?

476
00:32:30,369 --> 00:32:31,334
How have you been doing?

477
00:32:32,449 --> 00:32:33,698
Did you apply for a flight attendant job?

478
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:38,146
I'm waiting for the results.

479
00:32:38,886 --> 00:32:40,454
I applied to several airlines.

480
00:32:43,594 --> 00:32:44,957
I think you will make it.

481
00:32:51,613 --> 00:32:53,044
I'm going to go prepare for the show.

482
00:32:53,992 --> 00:32:55,205
Well then…

483
00:32:56,548 --> 00:32:57,717
I'll be waiting for you at the same table.

484
00:33:37,266 --> 00:33:38,462
Are you having a fight with Top?

485
00:33:43,052 --> 00:33:44,396
I don't think we'll make it.

486
00:33:45,709 --> 00:33:46,735
Is it that bad?

487
00:33:53,425 --> 00:33:55,256
Why don’t you two slowly patch things up?

488
00:33:55,913 --> 00:33:57,320
He came all the way here after all.

489
00:34:03,927 --> 00:34:06,350
I still can't forget what he did to me.

490
00:34:07,706 --> 00:34:10,743
But I can tell you still care for him.

491
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:14,488
What he did might make you mad.

492
00:34:15,336 --> 00:34:20,045
But if you still love him, I guess you might have to forgive but not forget.

493
00:34:20,524 --> 00:34:22,778
Forgive him but you don't have to forget what he did.

494
00:34:25,931 --> 00:34:27,825
But I think I'm doing that.

495
00:34:29,852 --> 00:34:33,899
When you two have a fight, don't attack him with his old wrong action.

496
00:34:34,049 --> 00:34:35,918
Otherwise, this relationship will not go anywhere.

497
00:34:37,153 --> 00:34:41,862
If you decide to give him a chance, you need to move on too.

498
00:34:52,771 --> 00:34:54,057
Let's go to bed.

499
00:34:54,057 --> 00:34:55,893
Tomorrow we will open early in the morning.

500
00:34:57,396 --> 00:34:58,259
Yes, Mom.

501
00:34:58,484 --> 00:34:59,871
Go to bed after you're done here.

502
00:35:00,346 --> 00:35:01,261
Come on.

503
00:35:21,096 --> 00:35:22,313
Can I spend the night here?

504
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:25,520
What changed your mind?

505
00:35:32,227 --> 00:35:34,100
I still want to seize my chance to cuddle you.

506
00:35:53,752 --> 00:35:54,367
Mew,

507
00:35:57,216 --> 00:35:58,495
can I ask you something?

508
00:36:00,769 --> 00:36:01,407
Um.

509
00:36:04,031 --> 00:36:05,393
Do you still love me?

510
00:36:09,416 --> 00:36:10,355
I do.

511
00:36:14,112 --> 00:36:15,316
I love you, too.

512
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:20,885
I know that what I did…

513
00:36:25,286 --> 00:36:27,286
can't be undone.

514
00:36:29,912 --> 00:36:31,912
You want me to pay and take revenge on me.

515
00:36:35,532 --> 00:36:37,205
But I want you to know

516
00:36:38,879 --> 00:36:40,411
that you don't have to do anything.

517
00:36:43,585 --> 00:36:45,259
I've suffered enough.

518
00:36:48,417 --> 00:36:55,878
I'm disgusted with myself already just thinking about not being able to hold you again one day.

519
00:36:59,993 --> 00:37:01,146
But you know that...

520
00:37:04,258 --> 00:37:06,300
I will not be able to forget about this easily, right?

521
00:37:11,487 --> 00:37:17,551
One day, if we fight, I might bring this up to hurt you again.

522
00:37:19,371 --> 00:37:19,990
Um.

523
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:22,900
I know.

524
00:37:24,025 --> 00:37:27,549
And I understand you so well.

525
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:32,358
But let's just leave it to the future.

526
00:37:34,257 --> 00:37:35,516
Right now I just…

527
00:37:46,958 --> 00:37:51,073
I want you to be sure

528
00:37:53,147 --> 00:37:54,758
that I will make you happy.

529
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:57,972
I won't blow the chance you gave me.

530
00:38:09,974 --> 00:38:11,127
I’m sorry, Top.

531
00:38:12,601 --> 00:38:13,479
I’m sorry too.

532
00:38:20,781 --> 00:38:22,136
Alright. Ready?

533
00:38:22,136 --> 00:38:23,797
Look at the camera.

534
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:25,363
Done.

535
00:38:25,363 --> 00:38:26,584
Can we do it one more time?

536
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:31,750
Okay. Sit still.

537
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:33,453
We’re done.

538
00:38:33,453 --> 00:38:33,953
All good?

539
00:38:33,953 --> 00:38:35,351
- Yes.
- Thank you.

540
00:38:35,351 --> 00:38:37,381
This is my first password ever.

541
00:38:37,506 --> 00:38:38,280
Look.

542
00:38:39,488 --> 00:38:41,488
My old one expired a long time ago.

543
00:38:42,177 --> 00:38:43,739
I went to Japan with my dad.

544
00:38:44,164 --> 00:38:45,880
But the only place I got to visit was the hotel.

545
00:38:46,506 --> 00:38:47,635
I thought we would travel.

546
00:38:47,935 --> 00:38:48,806
Sad, huh?

547
00:38:49,396 --> 00:38:52,270
There, there. Poor little rich boy.

548
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:53,682
Don't be sad.

549
00:38:54,613 --> 00:38:56,359
I want to be as rich as you.

550
00:38:56,656 --> 00:38:59,651
Have my passport ready. Have my visas ready.

551
00:38:59,692 --> 00:39:03,703
On a boring day, I would just go to the airport and pick where I want to go

552
00:39:03,703 --> 00:39:05,131
without caring about the cost.

553
00:39:05,131 --> 00:39:05,862
Do you want it?

554
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:08,286
You’re my boyfriend. I can give you that.

555
00:39:08,583 --> 00:39:10,202
No. I feel bad.

556
00:39:10,202 --> 00:39:11,563
It's your dad's money.

557
00:39:11,775 --> 00:39:15,291
Once you can make your own, I'll let you treat me.

558
00:39:15,672 --> 00:39:16,328
Fine.

559
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:19,290
I'm going to make a lot of money from the hostel.

560
00:39:19,766 --> 00:39:22,054
And take you to music festivals around the world.

561
00:39:22,054 --> 00:39:22,697
Sounds good?

562
00:39:23,396 --> 00:39:24,216
Let's do it.

563
00:39:26,078 --> 00:39:27,296
Don't forget your word.

564
00:39:27,421 --> 00:39:28,203
Um.

565
00:39:29,579 --> 00:39:31,156
Let's see which band I'm gonna listen to.

566
00:39:33,115 --> 00:39:34,141
Shit!

567
00:39:35,028 --> 00:39:36,364
Micro Hit Tracks.

568
00:39:36,964 --> 00:39:38,030
Hey!

569
00:39:38,537 --> 00:39:40,537
A bunch of songs I like.

570
00:39:40,537 --> 00:39:41,673
That's good.

571
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:44,060
So you don't have to switch from one record to another again and again.

572
00:39:44,659 --> 00:39:46,913
Holy shit. I want it.

573
00:39:47,379 --> 00:39:48,341
I'm going to go play it.

574
00:39:48,341 --> 00:39:49,379
Um.

575
00:39:58,603 --> 00:40:03,794
♪ If today I have your love to refuel me ♪

576
00:40:03,794 --> 00:40:07,801
♪ I might have enough energy to move forward ♪

577
00:40:07,801 --> 00:40:13,701
Ray!
♪ If only my heart had been filled with love… ♪

578
00:40:13,701 --> 00:40:16,343
♪ I wouldn't have died ♪

579
00:40:16,343 --> 00:40:17,759
Ray. Ray.

580
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:20,707
Your singing is filling the entire place.

581
00:40:20,707 --> 00:40:22,288
Shit. I got carried away.

582
00:40:22,288 --> 00:40:24,288
Sorry. I'm sorry.

583
00:40:25,951 --> 00:40:27,041
I want the record.

584
00:40:27,232 --> 00:40:28,851
Buy it and play it at home.

585
00:40:29,664 --> 00:40:30,477
Okay.

586
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:31,972
Should we go?

587
00:40:37,475 --> 00:40:38,205
Ray.

588
00:40:40,633 --> 00:40:42,358
Boeing stopped by to see me at the club the other day.

589
00:40:43,819 --> 00:40:44,659
Boeing?

590
00:40:46,458 --> 00:40:47,343
Ah.

591
00:40:47,744 --> 00:40:49,744
The ex that dumped you for Top?

592
00:40:50,697 --> 00:40:52,197
Yes, that's the one.

593
00:40:52,197 --> 00:40:53,332
You don't have to highlight it.

594
00:40:54,865 --> 00:40:55,841
What did he do there?

595
00:40:58,611 --> 00:40:59,635
Nothing.

596
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:00,811
He just said hi.

597
00:41:05,889 --> 00:41:06,889
Should I be jealous?

598
00:41:08,576 --> 00:41:09,242
No.

599
00:41:09,772 --> 00:41:10,985
He and I are only friends.

600
00:41:11,392 --> 00:41:12,164
Okay.

601
00:41:13,181 --> 00:41:15,891
If you say so, then I won't be jealous.

602
00:41:16,713 --> 00:41:21,612
Besides, a hot boyfriend with good taste and nice dance moves like me,

603
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:23,611
none of your exes can’t compare.

604
00:41:24,471 --> 00:41:25,336
Come on.

605
00:41:28,214 --> 00:41:33,389
♪ If today I have your love to refuel me…♪

606
00:41:44,464 --> 00:41:45,448
Cheum, let me help.

607
00:41:46,039 --> 00:41:47,785
Yeah, you go clean that table.

608
00:42:04,749 --> 00:42:05,468
Cheum.

609
00:42:06,749 --> 00:42:07,427
Um.

610
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:09,008
I've got something to tell you.

611
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:16,662
What is it?

612
00:42:17,512 --> 00:42:18,600
Is it about Ton?

613
00:42:19,405 --> 00:42:20,431
What did he do to you this time?

614
00:42:22,443 --> 00:42:24,147
He didn't do anything to me.

615
00:42:25,587 --> 00:42:28,370
Actually, what I’m trying to say is…

616
00:42:34,023 --> 00:42:35,051
The thing I said about Ton…

617
00:42:36,375 --> 00:42:37,378
was a lie.

618
00:42:39,403 --> 00:42:40,556
How could it be?

619
00:42:41,466 --> 00:42:43,371
I saw your nude photos.

620
00:42:44,988 --> 00:42:46,501
I told him to take them.

621
00:42:48,527 --> 00:42:49,642
And that night

622
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:51,712
I was the one who started it.

623
00:42:55,961 --> 00:42:57,961
Then why did you say he forced you?

624
00:43:00,335 --> 00:43:01,064
I…

625
00:43:01,992 --> 00:43:05,029
just wanna make him pay because he dumped me.

626
00:43:08,767 --> 00:43:10,344
But please don't be mad at him.

627
00:43:11,361 --> 00:43:15,012
Because of him, I know now that I like men.

628
00:43:23,942 --> 00:43:25,017
It’s fine.

629
00:43:25,342 --> 00:43:26,840
Live your life in a way that makes you comfortable.

630
00:43:27,381 --> 00:43:30,122
You are yourself now.

631
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:34,174
You've already started. Why not take it all the way, little bro?

632
00:43:36,913 --> 00:43:38,553
Come on. Give me a hug.

633
00:43:41,271 --> 00:43:43,271
My wicked little brother.

634
00:43:54,667 --> 00:43:56,138
Stop taking my photos.

635
00:43:56,314 --> 00:43:57,551
You've taken a lot of already.

636
00:44:01,751 --> 00:44:02,826
It’s been used up.

637
00:44:02,826 --> 00:44:04,571
Your photos took up all the space of this film roll.

638
00:44:07,228 --> 00:44:10,331
I think you can have an exhibition.

639
00:44:10,778 --> 00:44:12,778
Showcase the photos of those guys you screwed.

640
00:44:14,352 --> 00:44:15,344
Come on.

641
00:44:16,306 --> 00:44:18,411
I don't sleep with everyone in the photos I take.

642
00:44:19,522 --> 00:44:20,643
How would I know?

643
00:44:20,843 --> 00:44:23,051
Your behavior says otherwise.

644
00:44:24,935 --> 00:44:26,935
But from now on, there will only be your photos.

645
00:44:27,974 --> 00:44:29,233
Because I'll only sleep with you.

646
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:44,013
You know that I'm going to live in New York, right?

647
00:44:45,802 --> 00:44:47,400
Yes, I do.

648
00:44:48,374 --> 00:44:51,538
It's the reason you don't want to get into a serious relationship with anyone, right?

649
00:44:53,717 --> 00:44:56,352
But you might be my exception.

650
00:44:59,484 --> 00:45:00,468
What are you saying?

651
00:45:00,892 --> 00:45:02,892
You don't have to act so sweet.

652
00:45:03,418 --> 00:45:07,196
Because I helped you with Atom, you’re returning the favor by becoming my boyfriend?

653
00:45:07,196 --> 00:45:08,334
No, you jackass.

654
00:45:11,604 --> 00:45:16,165
But it made me realize who really cares about me.

655
00:45:19,329 --> 00:45:24,102
No matter how nasty or shitty I am, he always stands right by my side.

656
00:45:31,472 --> 00:45:32,949
You are a romantic.

657
00:45:33,674 --> 00:45:35,504
You're delusional and get into something too easily.

658
00:45:36,251 --> 00:45:39,309
I bet you thought we were boyfriends ever since we first hooked up.

659
00:45:39,310 --> 00:45:40,484
No way, you asshole.

660
00:45:40,484 --> 00:45:42,256
I'm not that delusional.

661
00:45:43,052 --> 00:45:44,544
But you're the one who got my hopes up.

662
00:45:46,852 --> 00:45:48,242
I am the way I am.

663
00:45:49,866 --> 00:45:51,279
Do you want to be my boyfriend though?

664
00:46:00,545 --> 00:46:02,312
I'm leaving for New York in a few months.

665
00:46:04,874 --> 00:46:10,324
Do you want to change our status from friends with benefits to boyfriends?

666
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:16,222
You are leaving anyways.

667
00:46:19,052 --> 00:46:20,226
Why would we want to be boyfriends?

668
00:46:23,163 --> 00:46:27,068
I just want to spend the time I have left loving you.

669
00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:30,635
You will be the first one...

670
00:46:34,298 --> 00:46:35,557
I call ‘boyfriend’.

671
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:02,181
So was that a yes?

672
00:47:03,586 --> 00:47:04,612
No.

673
00:47:05,769 --> 00:47:07,176
Then why did you kiss me back?

674
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:10,840
I'm drunk.

675
00:47:14,989 --> 00:47:15,846
I'm drunk.

676
00:47:17,912 --> 00:47:18,748
Come on.

677
00:47:34,607 --> 00:47:35,533
Top.

678
00:47:35,652 --> 00:47:36,375
Hm?

679
00:47:36,375 --> 00:47:37,758
Take some of the food back with you.

680
00:47:39,752 --> 00:47:40,614
No, it's okay.

681
00:47:40,877 --> 00:47:42,621
If I'm hungry, I'll just come and eat here.

682
00:47:45,436 --> 00:47:46,707
I forgot to tell you.

683
00:47:47,257 --> 00:47:48,867
My mom is selling this place.

684
00:47:48,934 --> 00:47:51,024
I'm moving out after graduation.

685
00:47:53,361 --> 00:47:54,524
What a pity.

686
00:47:55,026 --> 00:47:57,595
This room is spacious and nicely located.

687
00:48:03,319 --> 00:48:04,874
You don't have to look for a new place.

688
00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:06,270
You can move in with me.

689
00:48:07,172 --> 00:48:08,019
Seriously?

690
00:48:08,545 --> 00:48:09,840
Your penthouse?

691
00:48:10,002 --> 00:48:10,713
Yes.

692
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:12,950
I'm living alone at the hotel.

693
00:48:13,357 --> 00:48:14,409
You can move in with me.

694
00:48:14,409 --> 00:48:15,823
So you don't have to pay the rent.

695
00:48:19,702 --> 00:48:21,174
We just got back together.

696
00:48:21,534 --> 00:48:24,081
Isn't it too fast to move in?

697
00:48:24,551 --> 00:48:26,956
Oh, please. It's not too fast.

698
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:28,175
It's good.

699
00:48:28,175 --> 00:48:30,200
We will get to spend more time together.

700
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:31,551
Compensate the time you were sulking.

701
00:48:33,165 --> 00:48:34,146
Sulking?

702
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:38,241
I wasn't sulking. I was hating you.

703
00:48:45,826 --> 00:48:47,340
There, there.

704
00:48:48,387 --> 00:48:49,921
But we are cool now, aren't we?

705
00:48:50,361 --> 00:48:51,974
Are we back to loving each other?

706
00:48:52,865 --> 00:48:53,669
Um.

707
00:48:55,005 --> 00:48:56,155
But less than before.

708
00:48:57,108 --> 00:48:58,278
That's alright.

709
00:48:58,278 --> 00:49:01,699
I'm gonna make you love me even more.

710
00:49:01,699 --> 00:49:05,090
I'll wake up early in the morning and cook for you every day.

711
00:49:05,090 --> 00:49:07,608
In the evening, I'll take you to the gym.

712
00:49:07,608 --> 00:49:10,557
And we will cuddle every night.

713
00:49:10,935 --> 00:49:12,550
You're going to love it so much.

714
00:49:16,105 --> 00:49:17,376
What should I do?

715
00:49:17,524 --> 00:49:18,348
Please.

716
00:49:18,348 --> 00:49:19,362
Move in with me.

717
00:49:20,470 --> 00:49:21,600
This is difficult.

718
00:49:23,654 --> 00:49:25,006
It's not that difficult.

719
00:49:25,006 --> 00:49:26,383
Top.

720
00:49:27,477 --> 00:49:28,823
Are you being stubborn?

721
00:49:28,823 --> 00:49:30,027
Okay. I give in.

722
00:49:31,676 --> 00:49:33,138
I surrender.

723
00:49:41,106 --> 00:49:42,478
Move in with me, Mew.

724
00:49:46,781 --> 00:49:48,093
Can I think about it?

725
00:49:48,754 --> 00:49:50,253
It’s quite a big deal.

726
00:49:50,462 --> 00:49:52,002
You tend to keep your room minimal.

727
00:49:52,002 --> 00:49:54,547
But I have lots of plants and books.

728
00:49:55,716 --> 00:49:57,654
Are you really allowing me in your personal space?

729
00:50:00,150 --> 00:50:01,826
We must find our common ground.

730
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:04,488
You have time to think, Mew.

731
00:50:05,062 --> 00:50:06,357
I don't want to force you.

732
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:10,243
I just want to spend more time with you.

733
00:50:13,938 --> 00:50:14,946
Think it through.

734
00:50:25,991 --> 00:50:26,540
Here.

735
00:50:28,117 --> 00:50:29,041
For me?

736
00:50:29,304 --> 00:50:30,451
What's the occasion?

737
00:50:31,296 --> 00:50:32,324
Your birthday.

738
00:50:32,897 --> 00:50:34,038
I haven't got you any gifts.

739
00:50:36,285 --> 00:50:36,926
Take a look.

740
00:50:43,792 --> 00:50:44,517
Do you like it?

741
00:50:46,228 --> 00:50:47,985
So you remembered I wanted this one, huh?

742
00:50:47,985 --> 00:50:49,050
Of course, I did.

743
00:50:49,050 --> 00:50:51,086
I collect lots of details about you.

744
00:50:51,253 --> 00:50:52,302
You have no idea.

745
00:50:55,830 --> 00:50:56,939
Thanks.

746
00:50:57,986 --> 00:51:01,377
I feel a little bad but I also want it.

747
00:51:01,377 --> 00:51:02,326
Can I have it?

748
00:51:03,556 --> 00:51:04,972
You're my boyfriend.

749
00:51:05,976 --> 00:51:07,122
I'll pay anything for you.

750
00:51:12,162 --> 00:51:12,866
Can I try it?

751
00:51:26,201 --> 00:51:27,477
What are you looking at?

752
00:51:27,477 --> 00:51:28,444
Why are you staring at me?

753
00:51:29,856 --> 00:51:32,544
When you do things like this, you look so impassioned.

754
00:51:34,196 --> 00:51:37,026
When you look impassioned, you look hotter.

755
00:51:39,427 --> 00:51:40,557
I'm always hot.

756
00:51:41,513 --> 00:51:43,027
I'm hot no matter what I do.

757
00:51:44,701 --> 00:51:46,184
Yeah, whatever you say.

758
00:51:46,184 --> 00:51:48,294
You just have to escalate my compliment, don't you?

759
00:51:49,202 --> 00:51:50,620
Then say I'm not hot.

760
00:51:50,883 --> 00:51:51,573
Can you?

761
00:51:51,573 --> 00:51:53,005
You're hot, alright?

762
00:51:53,654 --> 00:51:54,367
Sand.

763
00:51:58,031 --> 00:51:58,763
Boeing.

764
00:52:00,961 --> 00:52:01,908
What are you doing here?

765
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:05,303
I've got something to talk to you about.

766
00:52:05,747 --> 00:52:06,958
But...

767
00:52:08,308 --> 00:52:09,599
We can talk some other day.

768
00:52:10,059 --> 00:52:11,755
You must be busy with your friend.

769
00:52:11,755 --> 00:52:12,617
I'm not his friend.

770
00:52:15,532 --> 00:52:16,248
I'm his boyfriend.

771
00:52:19,892 --> 00:52:21,014
Ray, this is Boeing.

772
00:52:21,325 --> 00:52:22,351
Boeing, this is Ray.

773
00:52:23,143 --> 00:52:25,912
Hello, Ray.

774
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:27,919
Nice to meet you.

775
00:52:28,701 --> 00:52:29,405
Yep.

776
00:52:30,347 --> 00:52:32,405
I'm sorry.

777
00:52:32,692 --> 00:52:34,414
I didn't know Sand has a boyfriend.

778
00:52:34,798 --> 00:52:35,800
We haven't talked.

779
00:52:43,444 --> 00:52:44,452
Can you go home first, Ray?

780
00:52:45,337 --> 00:52:46,694
I need to have a word with my friend.

781
00:52:47,254 --> 00:52:48,494
Aren't we going home together?

782
00:52:48,805 --> 00:52:50,038
Go to my house.

783
00:52:53,001 --> 00:52:54,103
Some other day maybe.

784
00:52:54,485 --> 00:52:56,414
Once I'm done talking to him, I'll call you.

785
00:53:10,408 --> 00:53:11,981
You have a boyfriend.

786
00:53:11,981 --> 00:53:13,440
Why didn't I hear the update?

787
00:53:15,154 --> 00:53:17,154
It's not something we must update, is it?

788
00:53:19,173 --> 00:53:20,647
State your business.

789
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:24,098
I was planning on inviting you to the Arctic Monkeys concert with me.

790
00:53:24,457 --> 00:53:25,728
They're coming to Bangkok.

791
00:53:26,451 --> 00:53:28,370
I remember you like them.

792
00:53:29,538 --> 00:53:30,991
Yes, I know they are.

793
00:53:32,484 --> 00:53:33,917
But I think the tickets were all sold.

794
00:53:35,655 --> 00:53:38,161
If you want to go, I can find the ticket for you.

795
00:53:38,854 --> 00:53:40,789
So we can attend a concert together like we did before.

796
00:53:40,956 --> 00:53:43,227
One time you took me to…

797
00:53:44,636 --> 00:53:45,639
What concert again?

798
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:46,636
Just forget it.

799
00:53:48,005 --> 00:53:49,195
I don't think I'll go.

800
00:53:49,195 --> 00:53:50,207
I need to work.

801
00:53:52,752 --> 00:53:53,456
Okay.

802
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:58,871
I'm glad to see you happy.

803
00:54:02,521 --> 00:54:04,747
But Ray seems to come from money.

804
00:54:05,058 --> 00:54:06,049
Pretty fierce.

805
00:54:07,459 --> 00:54:08,629
Doesn't seem like your type.

806
00:54:13,401 --> 00:54:17,654
Well, someone who's completely my type dumped me for someone else.

807
00:54:20,593 --> 00:54:23,414
Alight, I was stupid.

808
00:54:25,146 --> 00:54:27,328
I've been living with the guilt for a year.

809
00:54:28,497 --> 00:54:31,772
Our dream to do things together,

810
00:54:33,734 --> 00:54:37,252
our dream to attend music festivals around the world,

811
00:54:38,497 --> 00:54:39,829
I blew it all.

812
00:54:46,078 --> 00:54:49,110
I know you're with someone new now.

813
00:54:52,832 --> 00:54:54,508
But I'm willing to be the bad guy here.

814
00:54:57,215 --> 00:54:58,259
I want to know

815
00:54:59,167 --> 00:55:00,709
if I still have a chance.

816
00:55:13,712 --> 00:55:15,064
I don't want to go home yet.

817
00:55:15,725 --> 00:55:17,097
Can I go to your place?

818
00:55:18,165 --> 00:55:19,497
Don't think that's a good idea.

819
00:55:20,321 --> 00:55:21,653
I have a roommate.

820
00:55:22,366 --> 00:55:23,374
Not convenient.

821
00:55:24,459 --> 00:55:27,200
Roommate or Ray?

822
00:55:29,328 --> 00:55:31,105
I'll just go somewhere else then.

823
00:55:32,253 --> 00:55:35,407
I just want to be with someone tonight.

824
00:55:36,436 --> 00:55:38,436
I thought you would give me the friendship.

825
00:55:41,021 --> 00:55:42,477
Just friendship.

826
00:55:42,942 --> 00:55:43,932
That I can give you.

827
00:55:45,318 --> 00:55:46,940
You can come over to the club if you have any trouble.

828
00:55:49,667 --> 00:55:51,023
You're just so…

829
00:55:51,644 --> 00:55:52,882
lovely.

830
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:55,502
You never yell at me.

831
00:55:57,318 --> 00:55:59,237
That's why I want you in my life.

832
00:56:00,932 --> 00:56:03,458
No matter what status.

833
00:56:09,243 --> 00:56:10,656
What are you guys doing?

834
00:56:14,719 --> 00:56:16,213
I thought you left, Ray.

835
00:56:16,855 --> 00:56:18,004
I didn't want to leave yet.

836
00:56:18,530 --> 00:56:19,947
I want to take you home.

837
00:56:21,493 --> 00:56:22,457
You don't have to.

838
00:56:22,887 --> 00:56:24,334
I can ride my bike home.

839
00:56:24,594 --> 00:56:26,898
Besides, I didn't drink at all.

840
00:56:29,655 --> 00:56:30,582
What about you, Boeing?

841
00:56:31,466 --> 00:56:32,343
Are you going home?

842
00:56:32,579 --> 00:56:34,174
No.

843
00:56:34,579 --> 00:56:35,891
I still want to go somewhere.

844
00:56:36,553 --> 00:56:37,946
But Sand doesn't want to go with me.

845
00:56:38,726 --> 00:56:39,916
How about we go to my place?

846
00:56:42,038 --> 00:56:43,254
What are you doing, Ray?

847
00:56:43,661 --> 00:56:44,932
Just go home and rest.

848
00:56:45,230 --> 00:56:46,018
It's late.

849
00:56:46,018 --> 00:56:47,230
Don't be boring.

850
00:56:48,654 --> 00:56:49,860
Be nice to Boeing.

851
00:56:50,649 --> 00:56:52,176
You guys haven't met in a long time, have you?

852
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:53,908
He wants to continue, let's go with him.

853
00:56:55,378 --> 00:56:56,191
Interested, Boeing?

854
00:56:56,645 --> 00:56:58,169
I have a pool.

855
00:56:58,169 --> 00:56:59,195
We can have a pool party.

856
00:57:00,996 --> 00:57:02,059
Very interesting.

857
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:04,654
We can talk about our past.

858
00:57:06,636 --> 00:57:07,748
Besides,

859
00:57:09,827 --> 00:57:11,872
I'll get to know more about Ray.

860
00:57:44,248 --> 00:57:45,312
Hey, Sand.

861
00:57:45,312 --> 00:57:46,248
Why don't you come in?

862
00:57:48,311 --> 00:57:49,048
No.

863
00:57:49,478 --> 00:57:50,744
I don't have any extra underwear.

864
00:57:57,917 --> 00:57:59,249
You can get naked.

865
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:01,992
Boeing and I will do the same.

866
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:03,855
Um.

867
00:58:04,357 --> 00:58:05,278
Don't be shy.

868
00:58:05,995 --> 00:58:07,236
We've seen every part of each other.

869
00:58:12,482 --> 00:58:13,250
No.

870
00:58:13,895 --> 00:58:15,225
I can wear boxers.

871
00:59:01,679 --> 00:59:05,217
Directed by
Pinya Chookamsri & Tichakorn Phukhaotong

872
00:59:05,575 --> 00:59:07,737
Answer me. Do you still love him?

873
00:59:07,737 --> 00:59:09,850
If you can't answer that, how about you guys kiss?

874
00:59:09,850 --> 00:59:10,539
What the hell are you doing?

875
00:59:10,539 --> 00:59:12,738
I don't like him being around you.

876
00:59:12,777 --> 00:59:15,344
Deal with him. Or I'll do it.

877
00:59:15,345 --> 00:59:16,135
Ray.

878
00:59:16,135 --> 00:59:17,635
If you're still my friend,

879
00:59:17,635 --> 00:59:18,841
you can't avoid seeing him.

880
00:59:18,841 --> 00:59:21,269
I just don't believe someone like him is capable of change.

881
00:59:21,269 --> 00:59:24,706
My caring and pampering techniques are as good as my techniques in bed.

882
00:59:26,093 --> 00:59:27,056
What's happening, Top?

883
00:59:27,056 --> 00:59:28,654
Mew. There’s a fire. Let’s go.
