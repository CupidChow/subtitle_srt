1
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:07,950
Hey!

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,180
Ray.

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,070
I’m still in love with you.

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,830
If you still want to be my friend, care about my feelings.

5
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:16,870
I do care about your feelings.

6
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:19,080
That’s why I’m here.

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,910
By doing this, you think he will love you?

8
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:24,840
And what if I quit?

9
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:25,780
What would I get?

10
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,680
If you quit using drugs,

11
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:31,370
I'll sleep with you.

12
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,040
No penetration.

13
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:39,320
[THE EXTRA HOUR]

14
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:42,990
Freddy Mercury.

15
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:45,280
Paul McCartney.

16
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,520
Alex Turner.

17
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,680
You know what the one thing I have in common with my heroes is?

18
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,250
I have the same 24 hours.

19
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:01,110
Every minute of my life has to be spent well.

20
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,330
I have to take good care of myself so I’m always ready for work.

21
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:06,960
Nothing ever comes easy in my life.

22
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,070
I gotta work for everything I want.

23
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,550
I work.

24
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,370
I save up money.

25
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:17,490
I sleep.

26
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,370
I dream.

27
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:25,360
I go to bed alone, wake up, and go to work.

28
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,420
Motherf*cker!

29
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:08,800
Until…

30
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:12,410
He came along.

31
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,080
Hey.

32
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:18,230
An apology might be nice.

33
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:21,520
Like, did I run your mother over or something?

34
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,880
Oi, jerk, leave my mother out of this.

35
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,960
What you gonna do about it?

36
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,070
Douche—

37
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:27,290
Let’s take it easy.

38
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,240
Let’s not make a mess here.

39
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,550
Damn it.

40
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,600
Hey!

41
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,500
Oh, jerk!

42
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,260
Sand.

43
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,500
You’d do that to a man who’s turned his back?

44
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,960
My friend let it go, but you won’t, is that right?

45
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,280
- Sand.
- You wanna go?

46
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,100
Sand, enough.

47
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,000
Let our security handle this.

48
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:50,400
You, get out of my bar.

49
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,570
You caused trouble the last time you were here, too.

50
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,800
Fine. I’ll go.

51
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,560
Gotta stick up for your fellow pansy, huh?

52
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,760
And do you have a problem with a pansy like me?

53
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,120
I own this place.

54
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,340
Don’t act all tough when you’re drunk.

55
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,040
Or I’ll give you something to be sorry for and a black eye when you’re sober.

56
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,500
Get out!

57
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,740
I can handle anything, babes.

58
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,950
Holy crap.

59
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:26,800
Yo’s quite scary when she’s crossed, isn’t she?

60
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,260
That’s what she wants people to believe.

61
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,800
With me, she’s a sweet little thing.

62
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,200
He can say that again.

63
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:35,350
Hey.

64
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:37,930
Thanks for saving me.

65
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:40,770
He’d have bashed my head open if you didn’t intervene.

66
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,420
It’s alright.

67
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,320
I don’t like sneaky bastards like him anyway.

68
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,330
Can you help me with one other thing?

69
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:48,880
What is it?

70
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,540
Take me to your place.

71
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:57,470
It’s like somebody presses pause on all my 24 hours.

72
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,800
Next thing I know…

73
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,380
I’m living my 25th hour.

74
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,280
Ray’s extra hour.

75
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:02,050
Directed by  Pinya Chookamsri & Tichakorn Phukhaotong

76
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,020
Smells great.

77
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,150
Me or the breakfast?

78
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:27,530
It’s too early for you to flirt.

79
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:28,620
My brain don’t follow.

80
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:33,940
Multi-talented, aren’t you?

81
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:37,810
A thug by night, and a cook by morning?

82
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:41,010
I’m on my own so I gotta hold my own, you know.

83
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:43,390
Unlike you, I don’t have an Alfred.

84
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,740
Jerk. I’m no Bruce Wayne.

85
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,560
Here.

86
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,030
I can’t stomach it.

87
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:55,100
Still hungover.

88
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,700
Just take a bite. Maybe it’ll help.

89
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,320
Or would you rather have some black coffee?

90
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,310
Not a fan of coffee.

91
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,300
Well, what about some hangover pill? Might help.

92
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,680
That also never does crap for me.

93
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:10,870
Water, then?

94
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,010
Flush the toxin out.

95
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,120
No way.

96
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,260
What do you usually do to get over your hangover, then?

97
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,400
Jerk off.

98
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,550
You’re lively first thing in the morning, huh?

99
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,840
I mean it.

100
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,770
It helps.

101
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,080
When you do it, your brain releases endorphins.

102
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,400
Take a shower after that and…

103
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:37,900
Feels damn fresh.

104
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:38,950
For real?

105
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,420
I can’t do it when I’m hungover.

106
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,850
I just won’t get hard.

107
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,120
So?

108
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:48,650
Why’d you tell me that?

109
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:51,280
You need help?

110
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,280
You wanna give it?

111
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,220
Sand, have you seen my running shoes? I’ve been—

112
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,170
I… didn’t know you have company.

113
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,060
Hi, Ray.

114
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:22,960
Hey.

115
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,650
Did you have a rough night?

116
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:25,620
Yeah, kinda.

117
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,220
You want breakfast? I’ll cook.

118
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,300
No, no.

119
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,710
I already ate.

120
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,090
I’m heading to the gym.

121
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,890
Since when do you hit the gym?

122
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,250
What?

123
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,260
I’m just trying to take care of myself.

124
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:42,700
Unlike you… I don’t have someone to take care of me.

125
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,240
I’m heading out.

126
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,580
See you around, Ray.

127
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:50,420
See ya.

128
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,370
Bye, bud.

129
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,440
Yeah.

130
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,470
Wanna take up where we left off?

131
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:02,560
Your friend’s gone.

132
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,200
Jerk.

133
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:05,950
The moment’s over.

134
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:06,910
You’re on your own, man.

135
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:08,590
Oww, shoot.

136
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,600
I don’t want to go to the hostel today.

137
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,220
Can I stick with you?

138
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:17,860
Again?

139
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,570
I have a lot of places to be today.

140
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:20,560
You want to tag along all day?

141
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:21,950
Hell yeah.

142
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,390
I promise not to cause trouble.

143
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,240
I want to know you better.

144
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,610
Then eat your breakfast.

145
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:34,920
M’Kay.

146
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,870
You riling me up?

147
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:43,900
I’m just eating.

148
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,120
You want some?

149
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:49,090
Top. Let’s snap a photo.

150
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,180
Come on.

151
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,090
Smile.

152
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,900
Handsome.

153
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:13,930
Thank you for coming with me.

154
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,760
I wanted to see if there’s anything interesting around this part.

155
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,940
I’ll have some answers ready for my guests if they ask.

156
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:27,910
And here I was giddy, thinking you wanted to take me on a date.

157
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:30,040
But this is for work?

158
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,700
There, there.

159
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:37,130
It can be both work and a date.

160
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:38,180
Is that bad?

161
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,790
Good to hear. I won’t hold back on being openly sweet, then.

162
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:48,150
Hey, Top.

163
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:51,300
What do you think if we also offer tours?

164
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:54,760
Like, a bike tour around the neighborhood.

165
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,190
It’ll help build up trust with the locals.

166
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,800
They won’t resent us so much when we throw a party.

167
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,870
It sounds nice, but…

168
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,690
You seem to work really hard for this project.

169
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:09,800
Harder than the actual owner, that is.

170
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:12,960
Top.

171
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,950
What? Am I wrong?

172
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:17,000
I only see you and Numcheum working on it.

173
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,950
Ray already lends us his old house, you know?

174
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,730
Honestly?

175
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:25,870
Is it too late to make a change with the project?

176
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:27,440
Why don’t you use my hotel instead?

177
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:29,420
Top.

178
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:31,890
You said you’d be friendly.

179
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:33,630
I am friendly.

180
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,120
As long as he doesn’t mess with me.

181
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,240
Alright.

182
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,780
Let’s get going.

183
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:51,760
Here.

184
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,580
Mew!

185
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,030
Are you alright?

186
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:16,950
Are you hurt?

187
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,120
I’m okay. I’m fine.

188
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,530
Where the hell was he coming from?

189
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,200
Good thing it wasn’t a direct hit.

190
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:26,670
Let’s ask to see the security camera.

191
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,000
We need to press this.

192
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,360
It’s alright, Top.

193
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:31,290
Forget it.

194
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,920
Are you sure?

195
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,460
My glasses broke.

196
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,240
Stay here.

197
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:51,620
Let’s find a cafe around here.

198
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,720
I’ll fix these for you.

199
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,100
Let’s go.

200
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,880
Want a ride?

201
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,140
Nah. I’ll go on my motorbike.

202
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,780
But it’s hot outside.

203
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,440
Why don’t we go in my air-conditioned car?

204
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,230
I don’t trust you to drive.

205
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,730
You’re hungover.

206
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:27,090
I can drive.

207
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:28,490
It’s just a hangover. I’m not drunk.

208
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,410
I just don’t trust you with my life.

209
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:34,310
You can drive if you want. Just follow me.

210
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:40,970
Fine.

211
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:43,310
I’ll go with you.

212
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,330
Dust and grime and hot weather,

213
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:48,870
and you insist on going on your motorbike just to be cool.

214
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,160
That about sums up my world.

215
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,140
Dust and grime and scorching sun.

216
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,610
It’s not air-conditioning and air-purifier like yours.

217
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,870
You really can’t do anything, can you?

218
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,060
What a little master you are.

219
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,800
I can do it if I want to.

220
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,080
I just happen to want you to do it for me.

221
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:14,760
Whatever.

222
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:20,700
Outta my way.

223
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:23,510
Hop on.

224
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,260
Let’s go.

225
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:35,660
Hold on, alright? We’re heading off.

226
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:36,630
Hey, careful.

227
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,680
How much is this one?

228
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:44,320
15K.

229
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,850
But if you really want it, I’ll give you a discount.

230
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:48,750
You’re a regular, aren’t you?

231
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:49,600
I recognize you.

232
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,100
Thanks.

233
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,500
But I’ll take a rain check on that.

234
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,930
I’ll go with the cheaper ones.

235
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:58,650
15K?

236
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,230
For this old thing?

237
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:01,520
This is so common.

238
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:04,310
The rarer ones could cost 50K.

239
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:05,190
50?

240
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:06,080
Yeah.

241
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,060
Not my thing, I guess.

242
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,810
I’m thinking about dipping my toes into this market, too.

243
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:14,470
Just buy a bunch of T-shirts at some flea market and resell them.

244
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,920
Another profession?

245
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,690
You're a singer. You make liquor.

246
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,600
And you want to sell clothes now, too?

247
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,820
That’s what people do when they weren’t born with a silver spoon in their mouth.

248
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,910
My dream is big. I need money for that.

249
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,970
Oh, this one is nice.

250
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:41,620
What do you think? Is it alright?

251
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,230
Yeah.

252
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:44,650
Looks like you.

253
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:49,590
You want one?

254
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:50,840
No, thank you.

255
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:52,670
Change things up, you know?

256
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:55,180
Mr. Uptown Boy to Mr. Secondhand Rocker.

257
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:57,710
Try this one.

258
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:00,610
What the hell is this?

259
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:02,290
There’s no way I’m putting that on.

260
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:04,780
No. I’m not wearing it. It doesn’t suit me.

261
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,340
Stop being annoying and go try it on.

262
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,670
You’re with me today so you do my things.

263
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:11,290
- What the? No way.
- Get changed and let me see.

264
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,640
I think it looks nice on you.

265
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,920
Yellow is your color, huh?

266
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:24,840
Do you not see that it’s too small for me?

267
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,560
It’s not small. This is the vibe.

268
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,010
It is small.

269
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:29,380
Let’s try something else.

270
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:31,560
Oh, no. Enough already!

271
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,510
Let’s try another one.

272
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:54,360
Go.

273
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,980
Enough!

274
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,360
Sand.

275
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:02,780
Hmm?

276
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:03,800
Come help me.

277
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,180
Help you with what?

278
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:06,700
Just come here, will you?

279
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,710
I need your help.

280
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:09,290
Hurry.

281
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:10,950
What’s with you?

282
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,040
So?

283
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:15,820
What do you need my help with?

284
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:19,950
Take the shirt off me.

285
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:25,640
What’s happened to your own hands, man?

286
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,710
But I want you to do it for me.

287
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:28,870
Please?

288
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,530
Oh, you…

289
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:41,620
Keep your arms up.

290
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:49,670
My pants, too.

291
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,890
I’m not helping you with your hangover here.

292
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,700
That’s not what I’m asking.

293
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,890
I just want you to take my pants off.

294
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:05,410
But if that’s where your mind’s at,

295
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,310
I won’t complain, though.

296
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,120
That’s enough.

297
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,420
I’m sure you can take care of the rest.

298
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:48,040
Try this last one on.

299
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,850
I think this should work.

300
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,590
Why don’t you try them on?

301
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:43,790
What do you think?

302
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:44,730
Does it work?

303
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:46,590
Yeah.

304
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,640
I’ll make do with these till I can have them repaired.

305
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:55,830
What are you looking at?

306
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,780
How long have you been wearing glasses?

307
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:03,450
What’s your prescription?

308
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,750
-5.00.

309
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,670
Been that way since high school.

310
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:10,160
I’m used to wearing them.

311
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:12,680
I tried contact lenses.

312
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,900
But they were irritated.

313
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,790
Why don’t you try Lasik?

314
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,320
A friend of mine had it, and they said their eyesight is so much better.

315
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,620
I’d love to,

316
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,220
but what if it hurts?

317
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,460
Oh, there’s no need to worry.

318
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:30,260
It takes no time at all to recuperate.

319
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,320
Really?

320
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,050
Hmm.

321
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,200
But now that I think about it…

322
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:44,720
I don’t want you to get it now.

323
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:45,770
Oh?

324
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,160
I like you better looking like a nerd.

325
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,250
Whatever happened to worrying about my eyesight?

326
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,520
I’m still worried about that.

327
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:02,430
I want you to see me clearly.

328
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:09,200
But I can’t deny that you in glasses are both cute and sexy all at once.

329
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:16,890
You’re babbling.

330
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:20,540
It’s only the truth.

331
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,370
Your bill, sir.

332
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:29,410
Thank you.

333
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:46,720
Here.

334
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:55,260
Well,

335
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:57,420
should we head back to the hostel?

336
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,100
Yeah.

337
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,170
Let’s go.

338
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:18,660
Here.

339
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,230
Thank you.

340
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:26,510
This is the prototype website I’ve been working on.

341
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:28,640
It’s easy to use.

342
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:31,300
Thanks.

343
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,550
I’ll send this to the rest of them to check out.

344
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,790
I’m alright with anything, though.

345
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:40,560
You don’t look particularly eager about this?

346
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:43,510
This hostel ultimately belongs to Ray.

347
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:45,550
And the professor only wants a business plan.

348
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:46,860
I’m just going along with them.

349
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,960
I’m more eager about you.

350
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,540
Huh?

351
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,440
What are you talking about?

352
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:14,210
You usually wear shorts and a T-shirt.

353
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:15,820
What’s the occasion today?

354
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,560
A shirt and slacks?

355
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,690
You’re acting weird.

356
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,390
Weird how?

357
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,520
I’m just… I’m just shuffling up my style.

358
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:31,820
The usual monotonous thing is too predictable, right?

359
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,740
It’s boring.

360
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:36,070
Don’t you think?

361
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,280
Oh?

362
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,110
Have you been working out lately?

363
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,210
You look real fit.

364
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:45,860
What are you doing?

365
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:47,320
What do you want?

366
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,000
Wanna go for a dip?

367
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,300
Hey.

368
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,070
Hmm?

369
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,390
Can I ask you something?

370
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:31,710
Yeah?

371
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,430
Besides me,

372
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,920
are you fooling around with anyone else right now?

373
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:39,110
What’s that?

374
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:40,560
Are you being jealous?

375
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:41,990
Or are you wary?

376
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:43,890
Don’t worry about it. I’m all about safe sex.

377
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,640
No.

378
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:46,560
I…

379
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:48,590
I’m just curious.

380
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:52,030
If you’re doing it, that means I can, too, right?

381
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:57,010
Wow, you’re a real playboy, aren’t you?

382
00:24:57,810 --> 00:24:58,770
Well…

383
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:02,300
I have a few people I meet up with regularly.

384
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:04,250
But I’m getting more cautious now.

385
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:06,630
One of them took a video without asking, trying to make money out of it.

386
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:07,850
But I threatened them into deleting it.

387
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:15,210
Serves you right for being slutty.

388
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,640
Serves me right, you said?

389
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:17,980
Serves me right, huh?

390
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,270
Serves me right, alright.

391
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:20,170
How about this?

392
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,560
Now this serves me right.

393
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,690
Stop it, you.

394
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,010
It tickles.

395
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:26,180
Does it?

396
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,410
Stop it.

397
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:38,120
I feel like I should stop sleeping around for a bit.

398
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:41,060
It’s been feeling so empty lately.

399
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,250
In the end,

400
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:47,430
I want to have sex with someone I can… talk to for a little, you know?

401
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,480
Like, have great sex, have good chats,

402
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,130
and…

403
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:55,380
Someone I can get affectionate with.

404
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:58,060
Right now…

405
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,360
There’s only you.

406
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,090
Hey, there.

407
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:26,820
Take it down a notch, guys.

408
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:27,850
You doing it outdoors now?

409
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:32,050
What are you doing here?

410
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:33,450
I didn’t think anyone would be here today.

411
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,900
Is that why you’re doing whatever you damn well please?

412
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:40,350
It’s nothing. We’re just having some fun.

413
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,040
Right?

414
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:42,640
Yeah.

415
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,430
Oh, hey, Nick.

416
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:46,680
How’s our website coming along?

417
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,610
I sent the sample to Boston.

418
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,130
I’ll forward it to you later.

419
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,730
Sure. No hurry.

420
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,660
I guess I should go.

421
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,830
Leave you guys to it.

422
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,760
Let’s go, Top.

423
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:08,810
I didn’t know Boston was seeing Nick.

424
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,430
I doubt he is.

425
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:17,860
He’s probably just fooling around.

426
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:19,850
Really?

427
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:22,410
But Nick is really nice.

428
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,640
That’s a shame.

429
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,790
I want Boston to date someone seriously.

430
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:27,430
Get him to quit sleeping around, you know.

431
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,250
They’re adorable, aren’t they?

432
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:38,400
Let’s go.

433
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,400
I didn’t know they have concerts in parking lots now.

434
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:51,490
Yeah, anywhere’s possible these days.

435
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,310
It’s cool.

436
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:57,470
I haven’t been to a concert like this in ages.

437
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,960
The only music I listen to is the one played at bars.

438
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:04,590
Not that I listen to it much, anyway.

439
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,710
I’m usually busy staring at the singer’s mug.

440
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:08,970
You’re so full of crap.

441
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,920
You never paid attention to me.

442
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:15,410
If it wasn’t my glorious kindness for giving you a ride home that day,

443
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,350
you wouldn’t even have spared me a glance.

444
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:19,850
Did I just hear pain in your tone?

445
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:20,960
Not at all.

446
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:22,520
Fine.

447
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,200
I’ll reserve a front-row table next time

448
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,620
and I’ll even give you some generous tips.

449
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,680
Might as well be your biggest fan, right?

450
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:30,630
You’re so full of nonsense, you know that?

451
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,350
This is nice.

452
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:36,480
You want beer?

453
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,250
I’ll go buy some.

454
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,260
Sure.

455
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:39,490
I’ll come with you.

456
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:43,010
No. Stay here. It’s too crowded.

457
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:44,040
I don’t want us to lose this good spot.

458
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:44,810
You stay.

459
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,650
Okay.

460
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:47,380
You want money?

461
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,630
I can treat you at least this much.

462
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:55,580
Okay, then.

463
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,340
Be right back.

464
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,400
Uh, is this spot available?

465
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:09,550
Oh, of course.

466
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,200
Are you here by yourself?

467
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,340
I’m here with a friend.

468
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,670
He went to get some beer.

469
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:17,040
Oh, okay.

470
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,240
I’m here alone, though.

471
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,300
That’s a nice top. Where did you get it?

472
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:24,460
This thing?

473
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,550
It’s secondhand.

474
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,920
Okay.

475
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,230
Sorry to chat you up, but I’m alone, after all.

476
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:32,750
My friends don’t usually enjoy this kind of thing.

477
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,960
But maybe next time I won’t have to come alone.

478
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:38,030
My name’s Summer.

479
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:38,790
What’s your name?

480
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:40,390
I’m Ray.

481
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,650
Summer… that’s a nice name.

482
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,290
You like this kind of music?

483
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:51,140
Yes.

484
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:52,890
Here’s your beer.

485
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:54,590
The line was so freaking long.

486
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:55,800
Thank you.

487
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:58,070
What’s this?

488
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:02,180
I left you for a minute and you’re already hitting on somebody?

489
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:03,260
It’s not that.

490
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,450
She’s by herself so she wants some company.

491
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:07,140
Yeah?

492
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:08,830
She said the shirt is nice.

493
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,440
Did you tell her I dressed you?

494
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:13,490
Nope.

495
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,080
Should I?

496
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:17,460
No.

497
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,320
I was kidding.

498
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:28,440
Hello.

499
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,480
We’re JEKD.

500
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,250
The next song we’re playing is called Night Love.

501
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,930
Are you guys ready?

502
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:37,270
Yes!

503
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:39,530
Alright, then. Let’s hit it.

504
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,720
Hello.

505
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:48,680

Welcome to Blind Dining.

518
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:05,720
You will be dining in complete darkness.

519
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,900
You won’t see the food in front of you.

520
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:13,520
But you will be guided by our staff who are all visually impaired.

521
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,200
You will find out later what you eat.

522
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:19,290
This is so cool.

523
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:21,020
I’ve never heard of anything like this.

524
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:23,550
I found this place in some reviews.

525
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:24,790
Thought we should try it.

526
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:28,920
I mean, I could just take my glasses off and experience the same thing.

527
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:32,710
Well, then, I’ll be your eyes for the night.

528
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,290
Are you Top?

529
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:12,020
Hey, we’ve been holding hands all day and you don’t remember?

530
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:13,910
I was joking.

531
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:15,330
I can’t see anything, you know.

532
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:21,010
Oh, someone’s here.

533
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,880
Did I even get the food with my spoon?

534
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,490
Want me to give you a bite?

535
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:44,860
Sure.

536
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:49,080
Say ‘ah.’

537
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,140
I’m here.

538
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:58,780
Should we try guessing what this is?

539
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,060
Sure.

540
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:00,630
Alright.

541
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:04,590
Three, two, one.

542
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:05,820
- Mushroom soup.
- Mushroom soup.

543
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:09,850
Obviously.

544
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:26,360
Oh, this smells great.

545
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:30,680
Spring roll.

546
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,150
Yeah, right?

547
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:34,950
I can tell, too.

548
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:49,900
I made a mess.

549
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:51,210
You did?

550
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,300
Let me help.

551
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:56,790
Top.

552
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,610
You’re only making it worse.

553
00:34:58,610 --> 00:34:59,280
I can’t see, you know?

554
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,240
I’ll do it.

555
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:03,210
I thought my eyes would adjust to the darkness by now.

556
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,630
Don’t use your eyes.

557
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:06,740
Use your feelings.

558
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:10,660
You said to me at the bookstore that your senses are strong, right?

559
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:12,360
So use them.

560
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:14,200
What are they telling you?

561
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:44,130
♪ Night love ♪

562
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:46,010
♪ Night love ♪

563
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:47,340
♪ Night love ♪

564
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:48,320
You like it, then?

565
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,360
Yeah.

566
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:51,610
Catchy.

567
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:01,080
Oh, hey, Sand.

568
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:03,590
Don’t you want to be an artist?

569
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:06,370
Like, write your own music

570
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,680
and sing it to your own audience?

571
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:13,250
You’re only singing covers and let the audience yell,

572
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:15,590
“Motherf*cker!”

573
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,610
Like that.

574
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:17,450
Don’t you get tired of that?

575
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:18,700
Of course I do.

576
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:21,960
But what can I do when they love it?

577
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:23,430
And it’s my job, you know?

578
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:28,830
What about your dream?

579
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:31,210
What is your actual dream?

580
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:33,920
My dream?

581
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,310
You know,

582
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:41,150
I want to have enough money to go to all the music festivals around the world.

583
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,360
Picture this.

584
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,010
Great music and a good atmosphere.

585
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:50,560
Thousands and thousands of people who come together because they like the same music.

586
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:54,310
Drink, get drunk, fall asleep on the grass.

587
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,500
When it gets really late, they retire to their tent to sleep.

588
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,430
And then repeat for the next 3-5 days.

589
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:00,290
I think it’s just so cool.

590
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,250
Yeah.

591
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:03,800
Sounds like a hoot.

592
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:06,420
Where do you want to go?

593
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:12,110
I want to go to Summer Sonic, Fuji Rock, and Glastonbury.

594
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:13,200
I want to get muddy.

595
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,240
Coachella isn’t bad, either.

596
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,650
But if we’re talking about my real dream,

597
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:17,960
I want to go to Woodstock.

598
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:18,880
I want to be a hippie.

599
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,630
Oh, damn.

600
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:21,400
You mean, back in the 70’s?

601
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:21,960
Yeah.

602
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,510
You’ll need a time machine for that, I think.

603
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:25,540
They don’t do that anymore.

604
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:27,060
It might happen again, who knows?

605
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,780
This is nice.

606
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:40,590
Yes, Mom?

607
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:42,360
What?

608
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:44,760
Are there a lot of them?

609
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:46,910
What will you do?

610
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:50,340
Okay, you find some place to hide.

611
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,080
I’ll be there.

612
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:54,400
What’s wrong? What’s happened?

613
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,410
Some debt collectors show up.

614
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:56,670
But I swear I paid them everything.

615
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,030
Can you hitch a ride home?

616
00:38:59,030 --> 00:38:59,740
I need to go to my mother.

617
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:00,690
Hey, I’m coming with you.

618
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:03,330
What for?

619
00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:04,920
This isn’t a bar brawl at Yo’s.

620
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,120
These jerks mean business.

621
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,290
You can’t handle it.

622
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,660
I said I’d be with you all day today.

623
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,170
I have to go.

624
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:12,590
Maybe I can help.

625
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:17,380
Hurry.

626
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:18,480
Fine.

627
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,210
Hey.

628
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:29,740
What are we doing here?

629
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:30,900
I thought we were going to your mother.

630
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,240
My mother is here.

631
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,080
Your–Your mother is here?

632
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:34,730
Yes.

633
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:36,730
My mother is the manager at this go-go bar.

634
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,080
We’ve been waiting for him forever.

635
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,210
Will you have a little patience, huh?

636
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:48,530
Mom.

637
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:51,930
Oh, guys, he’s here. Grab him!

638
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:52,940
Hurry. Hurry.

639
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:55,440
Move over.

640
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,710
Come on up, baby.

641
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:57,750
What are you doing, Mom?

642
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:59,850
Sit down, dear. Sit down.

643
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:01,360
Sit your ass down!

644
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,160
Where are the debt collectors?

645
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:04,620
What debt collectors?

646
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:05,590
There’s no debt collectors.

647
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:06,780
But we do have a…

648
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,240
Surprise!

649
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,560
♪ Happy Birthday to you ♪

650
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:16,570

651
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:21,590

652
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,270

I hope all your wishes come true.

654
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:32,160
I wish you wealth.

655
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,160
I love you, idiot.

656
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:38,130
Did you have to make up such a scary story to get me here?

657
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:39,150
I was so worried about you, you know?

658
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,900
If I didn’t do that, would you show up?

659
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:44,560
I know you don’t like birthday parties.

660
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,180
Fine.

661
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,510
Thank you for this.

662
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:48,680
But you didn’t have to.

663
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,900
And don’t worry me like that again, alright?

664
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,270
Sure, my precious babe.

665
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:52,230
Let’s go again.

666
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:57,810
♪ Happy Birthday to you ♪

667
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:05,430
Aww, he’s all grown up now.

668
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,940
You didn’t say it was your birthday.

669
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:19,950
Why should I?

670
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:22,190
Who the hell do you think you are to need to know it?

671
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:26,120
Well, I thought you might want to spend the day with someone special.

672
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:29,140
Instead of letting a hangover idiot tag along all over the place.

673
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:32,940
A birthday is just another day to me.

674
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,490
And it’s tomorrow anyway.

675
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:35,300
Mom just got ahead of herself.

676
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:36,580
It’s not even midnight.

677
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:40,070
I’ll give you a birthday present later, then.

678
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:43,720
Unless you want it tonight.

679
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:49,190
What do you say?

680
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,680
Here.

681
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,120
Eat your fill, hon.

682
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:57,040
Whatever my baby boy’s friend wants is on the house.

683
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,090
I’ll be your drinking companion tonight.

684
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:00,170
Thank you.

685
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,990
Don’t overdo it, Mom.

686
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,470
The doctor is going to scold you at your health check up next week.

687
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,700
You keep nagging at me, you know that?

688
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,270
Who between us is the mother, exactly?

689
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:16,360
You know, Sand never brings his friends to see me here at all.

690
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:19,630
He never tells anyone his mother works in such a wonderful place.

691
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:21,390
Are you good friends?

692
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:22,810
I’ve never seen you before.

693
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:26,360
Well, I’d say we’re quite good friends.

694
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:28,480
We know each other so well. Every nook and corner.

695
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:30,050
Good to hear.

696
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:31,150
I’ll leave him with you.

697
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:33,030
This guy never stops working.

698
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:36,170
Did you know he sends himself to school?

699
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:37,810
On top of paying the debts I made, that is.

700
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,360
He has more savings than I do, for sure.

701
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,440
You’re babbling, Mom.

702
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,960
What? I mean it.

703
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,200
But you don’t eat enough.

704
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,790
Look at your gangly self.

705
00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:51,720
Oh, please. Slow down on the alcohol, kid.

706
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:52,870
Can you hold him back from time to time?

707
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:54,400
Of course, ma’am. I’ll do my best.

708
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:56,360
You’re asking the wrong person.

709
00:42:58,130 --> 00:43:02,320
Sand, come up here and sing for us, you birthday boy.

710
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,370
No way.

711
00:43:03,370 --> 00:43:04,610
I just came back from a concert.

712
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:05,830
My throat’s not in it right now.

713
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:07,770
What are you even saying?

714
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:08,430
Oh, please.

715
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:09,310
Just a little bit.

716
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:10,590
Why don’t you ask my friend over there?

717
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:11,440
Oh?

718
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:12,540
I don’t mind that.

719
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:13,800
Yeah, go ahead.

720
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,620
Your voice should be amazing if your look is anything to go by.

721
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:16,740
So true!

722
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:18,320
You said you wanted to give me a birthday present.

723
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,090
I’d love to see you have a go at karaoke.

724
00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:22,020
It’s my birthday so indulge me a little, man.

725
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:23,330
It’s just a little bit.

726
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:24,250
Get up there.

727
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:26,000
Alright, let’s go. Let’s go.

728
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,120
Which song do you want to sing, kid?

729
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:30,320
Hey, give the boy what he wants.

730
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,280
Fabulous!

731
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,890
Tell him what song you want to sing, dear.

732
00:43:32,890 --> 00:43:33,790
Okay.

733
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:35,320
Of course we have that song. We have everything.

734
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,660
Let’s go. Hit it.

735
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,920
A round of applause, please!

736
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:45,110
That’s a great song!

737
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:45,910
I love it!

738
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:47,860
(You jerk.)

I guess not.

747
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:27,680

You posted us on Instagram.

753
00:45:01,090 --> 00:45:02,280
Are we officially a thing now?

754
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:05,600
I never posted anything like that with anyone before.

755
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:21,600
Mew.

756
00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:23,690
Stay over.

757
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,360
Well, can you excuse me for a minute?

758
00:45:31,970 --> 00:45:32,730
Yeah.

759
00:45:52,870 --> 00:45:53,700
(Hello?)

760
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:54,920
Hey, Ton.

761
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:56,230
Yeah?

762
00:45:57,810 --> 00:45:58,620
I think…

763
00:46:00,410 --> 00:46:01,550
I think I’m ready to do it with Top.

764
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:04,960
As you should have a long time ago.

765
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:05,860
What are you waiting for?

766
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:07,150
Should I?

767
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:09,340
I don’t know.

768
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:13,990
I just feel like, if I don’t sleep with him, he’s gonna get bored of me.

769
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:17,190
You think too much. I’m sure it’s not like that.

770
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:19,580
Just go for it and use a condom, man.

771
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:21,220
Thanks.

772
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,210
Does this mean I passed your test?

773
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:55,380
Yeah.

774
00:46:57,980 --> 00:46:59,440
You’ve convinced me

775
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,460
that you really only have eyes for me.

776
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:13,930
Why should I look at them when I have my broken-glasses nerd right here?

777
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:20,100
Can I ask you something?

778
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:24,690
Why do you like me?

779
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,260
I’m just so happy when I’m with you.

780
00:47:35,150 --> 00:47:36,370
Do I need any other reasons?

781
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:17,650
Can you see me?

782
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:20,600
What are you even asking?

783
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:22,320
Of course I can.

784
00:48:35,130 --> 00:48:36,070
I love you, Mew.

785
00:48:54,470 --> 00:48:55,280
Hold on.

786
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:56,720
Careful.

787
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:53,580
I love you, Top.

788
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:56,700
I love you, too, Mew.

789
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:18,530
Here. Try it.

790
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:24,760
Is there something in here?

791
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:27,320
Try it and find out.

792
00:50:30,930 --> 00:50:32,380
Your mother is so cool.

793
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:34,430
She seems so understanding.

794
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:36,380
She is.

795
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:38,610
She raised me all by herself.

796
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:41,720
We’re like friends so I can talk to her about anything.

797
00:50:43,230 --> 00:50:44,180
And your father?

798
00:50:50,910 --> 00:50:51,960
I don’t know.

799
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:58,520
Mom had a one night stand with some guy when she was out drinking.

800
00:50:59,070 --> 00:51:02,240
She didn’t expect me, to be honest, but she didn’t want to get an abortion.

801
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,880
She also didn’t tell that guy.

802
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:09,100
She said it was just sex, not love.

803
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:13,090
Mad respect for her.

804
00:51:15,310 --> 00:51:17,180
Do you know who the guy was?

805
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:18,990
I do.

806
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:22,180
I went to see him once, you know?

807
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:24,820
But in the end, I chickened out.

808
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:26,220
Why not?

809
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:29,020
Don’t you think it’d be weird

810
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:32,250
if I just went up to him and told him I’m his son?

811
00:51:33,370 --> 00:51:34,610
He’d be so shocked he has a heart attack.

812
00:51:38,690 --> 00:51:39,730
You’re probably right.

813
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:46,690
You know why she named me Sand?

814
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:52,000
Mom said when she was doing it with my father, it was on the beach.

815
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,060
She said that’s probably where she conceived me.

816
00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:54,250
Are you for real?

817
00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:55,120
Yeah.

818
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:57,230
So she named me after that.

819
00:51:57,230 --> 00:51:57,980
That's cool.

820
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:05,710
Ray.

821
00:52:05,710 --> 00:52:06,380
Hmm?

822
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:07,370
Can I ask you something?

823
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:08,420
Of course.

824
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:11,450
What happened to your mother?

825
00:52:17,690 --> 00:52:19,050
She drank herself to death.

826
00:52:26,370 --> 00:52:28,580
But I think she already wanted to die before that.

827
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:31,240
Why?

828
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:33,510
My mother was an actress.

829
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:35,600
She dated my father.

830
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:38,210
She was knocked up, and I was born.

831
00:52:39,090 --> 00:52:40,220
She got depressed because of that.

832
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,310
She had to leave showbiz.

833
00:52:44,970 --> 00:52:46,630
We weren’t close anyway.

834
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:50,320
She rarely even came up to me and hugged me.

835
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:56,360
I… was probably a jinx for her.

836
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:02,610
Hey, I thought the cookie was supposed to make you laugh.

837
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:04,140
What’s with the drama?

838
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:05,410
It’s ’cause of you.

839
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:30,750
Thanks for today.

840
00:53:30,970 --> 00:53:32,820
I’ll send you the website.

841
00:53:34,530 --> 00:53:35,510
Hold on.

842
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:41,240
Can I stay over?

843
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:43,020
What?

844
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:45,330
Your usual MO is to bolt as fast as soon as you finish.

845
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:47,040
What’s with you?

846
00:53:53,370 --> 00:53:55,050
But you look so good today.

847
00:54:22,130 --> 00:54:23,080
Ray.

848
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:26,110
Ton, you bastard.

849
00:54:26,110 --> 00:54:27,520
What are you doing here?

850
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:30,190
I think that’s my line.

851
00:54:31,330 --> 00:54:32,800
What’s with you and Sand?

852
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:37,390
What? We’re friends.

853
00:54:40,770 --> 00:54:41,700
And you and Nick?

854
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:44,270
I’m here to talk about that hostel project.

855
00:54:45,050 --> 00:54:45,960
Sorry, dude.

856
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:47,850
I interrupted you guys again.

857
00:54:47,850 --> 00:54:48,750
I’ll be in my room.

858
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:49,300
Let’s go.

859
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:50,490
Hey, hang on.

860
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:53,830
Since we’re all here, let’s party.

861
00:54:53,830 --> 00:54:55,450
You’re just bothering them, come on.

862
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:56,320
Hey.

863
00:54:56,650 --> 00:54:57,490
It’s alright.

864
00:54:57,750 --> 00:54:58,700
Let’s drink.

865
00:55:07,110 --> 00:55:07,940
Sand.

866
00:55:08,850 --> 00:55:10,480
This ain’t your typical stuff, is it?

867
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:17,450
Cheers!

868
00:55:17,450 --> 00:55:18,800
Cheers.

869
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:19,560
Bottoms up.

870
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:23,420
Cheers!

871
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:25,840
Oh, I see that.

872
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:27,050
You do it, too.

873
00:55:27,050 --> 00:55:27,800
I see you, bro.

874
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:34,460
The cookies’ getting to me.

875
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:37,710
I told you to hold back.

876
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:39,690
Good thing I’m not driving.

877
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:41,910
Can I stay over?

878
00:55:42,330 --> 00:55:45,060
More often than this I’m going to start making you pay rent.

879
00:55:45,310 --> 00:55:45,860
Go ahead.

880
00:55:45,860 --> 00:55:46,840
Sand.

881
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:48,780
Can I ask you something?

882
00:55:49,390 --> 00:55:52,070
Are you and Ray going out?

883
00:55:52,510 --> 00:55:57,110
You two talk all lovey-dovey like you’re a thing, you know?

884
00:55:57,110 --> 00:55:58,680
Look at his face.

885
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:00,960
Look how squishy he looks.

886
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,850
He looks just like a dog my mother has.

887
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:05,240
You jerk, I’m not a dog.

888
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:07,170
And I’m not his boyfriend.

889
00:56:08,790 --> 00:56:09,600
Ray.

890
00:56:10,790 --> 00:56:12,440
I bet Sand likes you.

891
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:14,150
I can tell.

892
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:15,280
Really?

893
00:56:15,710 --> 00:56:16,770
So what is it, Sand?

894
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,140
Do you like him?

895
00:56:18,730 --> 00:56:21,320
My buddy here has both the looks and the dough.

896
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:22,880
His type is hard to come by, you know?

897
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:25,010
Now that you said that,

898
00:56:25,770 --> 00:56:27,460
my answer has to be yes now, doesn’t it?

899
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:31,040
But if you really want to know the answer, ask me again when I’m sober.

900
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:36,290
Do you like me?

901
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:38,670
Oh, oh, oh?

902
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:39,740
Kiss him.

903
00:56:39,870 --> 00:56:41,170
Kiss him, man.

904
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:42,880
Kiss.

905
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,120
Even if you really do like Ray,

906
00:56:45,290 --> 00:56:47,880
I doubt it will work out between the two of you.

907
00:56:48,470 --> 00:56:51,090
Ray’s whole ass is owned by Mew.

908
00:56:52,730 --> 00:56:53,980
What the hell are you saying?

909
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:54,860
What?

910
00:56:55,370 --> 00:57:00,670
Sand doesn’t know you’ve been in love with your best friend for years?

911
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:03,250
But Mew is with Top now.

912
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,190
Someone beat you to it, man.

913
00:57:05,190 --> 00:57:06,760
What a shame for my pal.

914
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:10,200
Oh, wait. My bad.

915
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:13,360
I remember you and Mew making out.

916
00:57:13,790 --> 00:57:15,600
Did you take his virginity?

917
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:17,020
Ton, what the shit are you going on about?

918
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:18,280
Oh?

919
00:57:18,590 --> 00:57:20,240
I saw everything.

920
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:22,190
I took some photos, actually.

921
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:23,810
What the hell did you do that for, bastard?

922
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:24,970
What?

923
00:57:25,430 --> 00:57:28,350
I just want to keep track of my best friend’s romantic moments.

924
00:57:28,350 --> 00:57:29,060
Was I wrong?

925
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:30,000
‘Keep track’?

926
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:31,520
Jerk!

927
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:32,240
Hey!

928
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:33,090
Hey, Ray!

929
00:57:33,090 --> 00:57:33,840
Ray, stop!

930
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:34,380
Ton!

931
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:35,650
Ray!

932
00:57:35,990 --> 00:57:36,840
- Ton!
- Stop it!

933
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:38,210
You’re drunk. Stop it!

934
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:41,010
Sand has every right to know.

935
00:57:41,210 --> 00:57:42,590
Ray is in love with Mew.

936
00:57:42,590 --> 00:57:43,570
They even screwed!

937
00:57:44,270 --> 00:57:46,270
But good thing you came along, Sand.

938
00:57:46,270 --> 00:57:47,440
He needs to get over Mew.

939
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:48,700
What does it have to do with you?

940
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:50,270
Then why the hell did you get so mad?

941
00:57:50,270 --> 00:57:51,930
If you’re not in love with him anymore, then why did you get so mad?

942
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:54,210
Oh…

943
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:56,490
Are you going to be two-timing?

944
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:57,750
Ray, stop!

945
00:57:57,750 --> 00:57:58,840
Come on!

946
00:57:58,840 --> 00:57:59,940
Stop it!

947
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:01,920
- Ton, enough!
- Stop!

948
00:58:02,790 --> 00:58:04,270
Go to your room!

949
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:08,570
I said go to your room!

950
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:11,980
Let’s go.

951
00:58:12,970 --> 00:58:13,730
Nick.

952
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:16,020
Let me warn you.

953
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:18,960
If you plan to fall for him, your life will be miserable.

954
00:58:19,170 --> 00:58:22,520
Because the likes of him doesn’t know who to love anyone but himself.

955
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:28,550
Crap.

956
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:51,320
Hey.

957
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:55,050
Don’t listen to what Ton said.

958
00:58:57,180 --> 00:59:00,400
If there’s something you want to know, you ask me.

959
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:06,330
Okay?

960
00:59:10,490 --> 00:59:11,370
Sand.

961
00:59:15,290 --> 00:59:16,250
Forget it.

962
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:17,110
I’m tired.

963
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:19,040
One more thing…

964
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:24,390
This has nothing to do with me.

965
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:27,360
Sand.

966
00:59:37,210 --> 00:59:38,140
Sand.

967
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:40,320
Hmm?

968
00:59:42,110 --> 00:59:43,350
Happy birthday.

969
00:59:46,990 --> 00:59:47,760
Hmm.

970
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:58,800
I’ve always thought Ray is my 25th hour, my extra hour.

971
01:00:01,010 --> 01:00:05,690
But the truth is everyone has the same 24 hours in a day.

972
01:00:07,030 --> 01:00:09,030
And within Ray’s 24 hours,

973
01:00:10,070 --> 01:00:11,550
I’m not a part of it.

974
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:20,780
I’m not that special.
