00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:15,030
It's a big deal.

188
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:16,450
It is.

189
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:18,760
We can make it bigger than other groups.

190
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:22,320
Show the professor the real one.

191
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:24,620
We allocate our duties.

192
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:27,420
And let my dad sponsor us financially.

193
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:30,030
I think it can work.

194
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:33,220
Mew, you will definitely get an “A.”

195
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,280
It's such a massive project with a small team. Are you sure?

196
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:43,060
Actually, I can handle the PR stuff.

197
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,280
Mew can be in charge of the finance and account.

198
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,590
But look at this place.

199
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,590
I think it needs a whole lot of renovation.

200
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,900
Not to mention the design.

201
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,700
Or should we just let Ton handle it?

202
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:00,430
Ton, are you even listening?

203
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:01,550
I am.

204
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:06,480
Do you want to do the hostel with us?

205
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,060
Or you want to build a massage parlor like your dad?

206
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,440
Come on.

207
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,360
No.

208
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:14,560
What do you want my help with?

209
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,640
She just said it.

210
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:19,860
Can you find someone who can help us with the building design?

211
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,190
Do you have any friends?

212
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:22,410
You didn't listen.

213
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:23,970
A designer?

214
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,210
Sure.

215
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:33,400
Let me handle that.

216
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:35,860
I have a friend.

217
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,680
His work was so good

218
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:40,060
that I want to use his service again.

219
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,420
Hi.

220
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,030
I'd like to get my phone repaired.

221
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,790
Hey!

222
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,280
I'd like to get my phone repaired.

223
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,440
- Hello!
- Oh!

224
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,880
Can you help fix my phone?

225
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:21,430
You're not supposed to be in here.

226
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,410
I called you many times but you didn't hear me.

227
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,460
Sorry, I was playing the game.

228
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:32,120
Could you step outside the counter?

229
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,040
Here.

230
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:44,210
Oh.

231
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,660
What did you do?

232
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:48,370
I dropped it.

233
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:49,370
The screen got cracked.

234
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:51,650
It doesn't respond properly and sometimes freezes, little bro.

235
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,310
Little bro?

236
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,880
I think we're the same age.

237
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,690
I'm a fourth year.

238
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:57,780
Yeah?

239
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,930
You look young. I thought you were younger.

240
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,780
Well…

241
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:09,070
I'm not sure if the problem is with the screen or something else.

242
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:12,030
And I don't think it can be done today.

243
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:13,960
I need to order some stuff for the fix.

244
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:17,110
Can you come get it some other day?

245
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,090
Of course.

246
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:20,250
No problem.

247
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:26,800
What's your name?

248
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:28,500
Boston.

249
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:32,650
Boston like the city?

250
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:35,490
Cool.

251
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,000
Thanks.

252
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:48,840
Can I have a number to call when the phone is done?

253
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:50,830
Yeah.

254
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:58,920
This is my friend's. His name is Mew.

255
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:06,810
What is your name?

256
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,210
Nick.

257
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:15,840
Once it's done, call me.

258
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:17,880
I will come and get it.

259
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:21,050
Happy to be of service.

260
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,880
Thailand.

261
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,040
The quiz about Thailand.

262
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:52,380
First question, what's the province with the most beautiful city plan?

263
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:54,750
You.

264
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,880
Yala.

265
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,950
Yala is…

266
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,500
correct.

267
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,450
Wow. My friend is smart.

268
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:05,020
One shot as your reward.

269
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:10,830
- The table with the highest score will get 50% off tonight.
- Does anyone want it? I'm not drinking it.

270
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:11,690
Give it to me.

271
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,360
What's the first hotel in Thailand?

272
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,790
Yo, it's too difficult.

273
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:25,030
Cheum, you should know the answer.

274
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,350
I wasn't even born yet.

275
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:28,480
But you should know every hotel in this country.

276
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,360
What about this side?

277
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:32,360
Do you know it?

278
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:35,700
What's your answer, handsome?

279
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:38,000
The Oriental.

280
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,110
The Oriental is…

281
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,970
correct.

282
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:45,970
Wow. Well done.

283
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:49,020
You get one shot for that. Here you go.

284
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:57,580
Guys, this is my friend Top.

285
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:00,600
He's the one designing our hostel.

286
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:02,880
Can I be your friend too?

287
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:37,330
We haven't even talked to you about work yet, Top.

288
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:40,010
We've been playing the quiz game all night.

289
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,940
That's alright. I have free time.

290
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,670
We can discuss work at the hostel.

291
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:46,790
Tonight, let's just get to know each other first.

292
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:51,550
I had no idea a business administration student was so smart and could answer every question.

293
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:53,480
I read a lot.

294
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,800
That's why I'm wearing specs.

295
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:58,600
You're cute with specs, Mew.

296
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,550
I like that.

297
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:09,380
More drinks?

298
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:12,350
Enough, Ray.

299
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:13,370
You've drunk enough.

300
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:14,550
- You might throw up again.
- Right.

301
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:16,090
You're a lightweight.

302
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,990
You drove here, didn't you?

303
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,940
Let Ton take you home.

304
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:20,680
I can't.

305
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,840
I'm not free tonight.

306
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,360
You're always a burden when you're drunk, Ray.

307
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:28,860
Right.

308
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,610
I'm such a burden.

309
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,560
What the hell is wrong now?

310
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:37,090
What the heck?

311
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,920
He's always so emotional when drunk.

312
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,090
Well then.

313
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,860
I'll go get more drinks.

314
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,360
I'm coming with you.

315
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:54,510
Yo said she had the new plum wine.

316
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:55,300
I wanna try.

317
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,370
Let's go.

318
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:57,500
I need lots of that.

319
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,070
Lots of that.

320
00:16:59,070 --> 00:16:59,690
You got it.

321
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:00,670
Great.

322
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:10,960
I think Top likes you.

323
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:11,840
What?

324
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,080
We're just friends.

325
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,680
Go home with him tonight.

326
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,500
Hey!

327
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,670
Are you nuts?

328
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:20,020
I don't think of him that much.

329
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,140
Well, think more then.

330
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:28,280
If you're to lose your virginity, lose it to this guy.

331
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:34,920
So that when asked, you can brag about sleeping with the top tier.

332
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,750
He's hot, tall,

333
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:42,790
and his family owns a famous hotel.

334
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:44,900
Think about it.

335
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:47,140
You're delusional.

336
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,270
Your friend is cute.

337
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:51,740
Can you match us up?

338
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,300
Please, don't.

339
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,780
Find someone saucy to your liking.

340
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,800
He's a sweet virgin.

341
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:02,400
Not your taste.

342
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,800
A virgin?

343
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,470
Seriously?

344
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,030
I wanna try.

345
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:11,220
I'm so sick of those fierce ones who already know it all.

346
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,330
I want something new.

347
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,020
Fine.

348
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,730
But I'm just gonna match you two up.

349
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:26,130
You carry on with the rest.

350
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,550
I bet Mew isn't interested in you.

351
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:32,370
He probably wants to go home, drink milk, read,

352
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:34,580
and put on easy-listening music.

353
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,710
Is there anything I want that I don't get?

354
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:32,810
Leaving already?

355
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,370
Yes.

356
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:41,540
But I still want to drink more.

357
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:46,510
How about we continue at my place?

358
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,970
There's alcohol, music,

359
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,010
and…

360
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:54,560
me.

361
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,910
That should be enough.

362
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,290
You again?

363
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:53,900
What are you doing?

364
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,120
Are you driving when drunk?

365
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:58,370
You're such a burden to society.

366
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:00,300
What if you hit someone?

367
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:02,280
And where are all your friends?

368
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,540
Why did they leave you alone?

369
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,140
Why are you talking so much?

370
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,790
Can you just drive?

371
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:10,280
I can't.

372
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,310
Call your friends and ask them to drive you.

373
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,210
Crap.

374
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,470
Your battery died.

375
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,210
Where do you live?

376
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,630
Watcharaphon Road.

377
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:40,280
Can you drive me home?

378
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,790
I'm hiring you.

379
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:45,150
I'm not your driver.

380
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,300
If you can't drive, take a nap here first.

381
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,300
You can drive when you're sober.

382
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:53,720
What the heck?

383
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,500
Hey!

384
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:06,800
I said don't drive.

385
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:11,560
Fine, I'll drive you.

386
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,190
Move.

387
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,140
Damn it.

388
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:21,620
I'm gonna charge you more than an airport taxi.

389
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:30,560
Legs up.

390
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:32,040
Get in.

391
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:16,910
Good.

392
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:19,130
At least I get to drive an expensive car once in my life.

393
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,880
Sorry, Mew.

394
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,480
I've got a bit of a headache.

395
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,560
Can I get some water?

396
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,400
Sure. I'll get it for you.

397
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,280
Make yourself at home.

398
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,480
Your room is nice.

399
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,400
It suits you.

400
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,400
It's my mom's old room.

401
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,640
I decorated it using ideas from the internet.

402
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,320
Now she moved to live out of town.

403
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,240
You said the room suited me.

404
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,800
Do you know me well enough, Top?

405
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,760
You know I don't have a headache, right?

406
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,880
I just needed an excuse to be in your room.

407
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,240
I do.

408
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,000
You do and you still let me in. Does that mean you like me too?

409
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,000
Um.

410
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,800
Do you know what's happening next?

411
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,640
I think I can guess.

412
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:01,640
Yeah?

413
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,920
But it's difficult to guess how I will start.

414
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:22,880
Top.

415
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,600
What?

416
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,800
Am I not doing it ok?

417
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,200
It's not that.

418
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,320
I'm just…

419
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,240
I'm not ready.

420
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:39,960
Are you scared?

421
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,600
I've never done it.

422
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,720
That's fine.

423
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,040
You'll make you happy.

424
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,520
Top.

425
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,160
I can't.

426
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,760
I'm sorry.

427
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:20,000
I just feel like I don't know you well enough.

428
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
We don't have to know each other to have sex.

429
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,760
But I can't.

430
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,960
I'm not someone like Boston.

431
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:40,280
What can I do to get you to know me well enough?

432
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,760
Want some ice cream?

433
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,040
Yo, you said he was your junior at the faculty.

434
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,880
How come you don't know where he lives?

435
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,520
I did ask him but he passed out already.

436
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,120
Ok. I'll try.

437
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,080
What now?

438
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,520
If you don't wake up, I'll leave you here.

439
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,720
Yeah, leave me here.

440
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,040
I'm not important anyway.

441
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,280
Leave me alone.

442
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,640
Go away.

443
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,120
Drunk and rowdy.

444
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,920
What a spoiled rich brat.

445
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,440
What should I do now?

446
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,920
Hey, don't throw up on my floor!

447
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,240
Go to the bathroom.

448
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,760
You exceeded your alcohol intake limit.

449
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,400
How did you manage to live this long?

450
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,520
Are you mad?

451
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,160
No.

452
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,640
Why would I be?

453
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,760
What kind of person do you think I am?

454
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,720
I just don't want my first time to be a one-night stand.

455
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,000
I get you.

456
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:59,120
I accept your decision anyhow.

457
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,600
Top,

458
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,800
do you know what else I'm afraid of?

459
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:09,920
What?

460
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,520
I'm very sensitive.

461
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,920
If I have sex with you, I'm going to be so into you.

462
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,000
How?

463
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:32,360
If I'm so into you, I will call you, snoop around your Insta,

464
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,720
and check my messages all the time.

465
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,280
I'm going to want you as my boyfriend.

466
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,800
I don't want to start it.

467
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,120
I hate to be heartbroken.

468
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:42,680
I don't want to listen to Ink Waruntorn's music and cry alone in my room every day.

469
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,120
Hey,

470
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,680
I get you.

471
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,800
Don't worry. It's not a big deal.

472
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:55,280
Besides, it's good that you accept how you really feel.

473
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,720
I should be the one apologizing.

474
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,920
I'm just used to starting things with this.

475
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:06,360
No one has ever asked me to have ice cream instead of sex before.

476
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,240
It's pretty good.

477
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,480
By the way,

478
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,240
can I crash here tonight?

479
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,040
Sure, you can.

480
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,160
But we will not do it whatsoever.

481
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,640
What about cuddle?

482
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:54,960
Can we?

483
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,240
Ok.

484
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,600
You're up, rich boy?

485
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,440
You were such trouble for me last night.

486
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,360
What trouble?

487
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,280
Are you the singer at Yo's bar?

488
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,200
Your name is…

489
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,800
Sand?

490
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,520
Yes, that's me.

491
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,640
Can't you remember anything?

492
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,400
When did you black out?

493
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,520
Why am I at your place?

494
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,200
Did we have sex?

495
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,440
So you got me drunk?

496
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,520
Next time, don't do that.

497
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,680
If you want me, you can flirt with me.

498
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,680
You're pretty hot.

499
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,760
I think I can live with that.

500
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,760
And now you think I want you?

501
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,600
Last night, you were as drunk as a skunk.

502
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,320
Without my help, you'll be lying dead in the streets by now.

503
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,600
Who asked for your help?

504
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,640
Why didn't you just let me sleep in the car?

505
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,480
And look at you.

506
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,880
Are you a criminal?

507
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,520
Where are my belongings?

508
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,520
They are all expensive.

509
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,000
Where is my watch?

510
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,720
My wallet?

511
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,360
My clothes?

512
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,160
Damn it! I rather help a dog than help you.

513
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,160
Get your stuff and go.

514
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,000
My car key?

515
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,200
Get out!

516
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,360
Is he crazy?

517
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,000
Why is he so frustrated?

518
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:13,520
Asshole.

519
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,320
What a burden to society.

520
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,280
When I read,

521
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,520
I feel like I have a different life.

522
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,640
I get to feel things I've never felt before.

523
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,840
I get to go places I've never been to.

524
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,240
I get to love and be loved.

525
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:40,000
I experience pain from love without having to really experience it myself.

526
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,000
Books lead me the way.

527
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:50,720
I just can't believe a cute and interesting person like you has never been in a relationship.

528
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:55,200
Don't you have people in a talking stage?

529
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,440
Some people came in.

530
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,360
But it was brief.

531
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,520
Maybe I've never found anyone with good chemistry.

532
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,360
Like real chemistry.

533
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,840
How can you tell who has the chemistry?

534
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:16,640
You must get to know them and talk to them.

535
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,280
Your book can't lead you to that.

536
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,560
I can tell.

537
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,560
I know who is honest with me.

538
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,520
My sense is always right.

539
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,760
What about me?

540
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,680
What does your sense tell you?

541
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:45,880
Will I be more or just someone who passes you by?

542
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,520
It's up to you.

543
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,920
Do you want to be more than a one-night sleep?

544
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,680
Can I?

545
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:25,920
Hold on one sec.

546
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,440
Hello. What's up?

547
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,360
(Hello, Mew.)

548
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,560
Where are you?

549
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,120
(A book store.)

550
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,640
Where are you though?

551
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,320
(How did you get home last night?)

552
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,360
I don't know.

553
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,320
I didn't go home.

554
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:52,800
I crashed at the bar singer's place.

555
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,720
And he chased me away. I'm so pissed.

556
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,280
Wait!

557
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,520
How did you get there?

558
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,000
Where is Boston?

559
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,200
He said he'd take care of you.

560
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,360
Mew.

561
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,480
Do you want this book?

562
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,440
I'll check it out for you.

563
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,160
Who are you with?

564
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:11,800
A friend.

565
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:14,800
Do I know him?

566
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,120
(Was that Top?)

567
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,960
Did you leave with him last night?

568
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:21,840
(Hey.)

569
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,280
I'll fill you in later.

570
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:24,600
I gotta go.

571
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:25,640
Bye.

572
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:26,880
Mew.

573
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,120
Mew!

574
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,080
It's now fixed and…

575
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,640
updated.

576
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,360
How much?

577
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:08,360
1,200 baht.

578
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,560
The discounted price.

579
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,400
Can I have the reason why I got the discount?

580
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:31,560
Done.

581
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:32,520
Hey.

582
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,040
Hold on.

583
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,360
Can I see the receipt first?

584
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,440
Lots of criminals walking around these days.

585
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,120
Just want to make sure.

586
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,280
Fine.

587
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,160
It's with one year warranty.

588
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:06,280
If there's a problem again, drop it here anytime.

589
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,520
It's frozen now.

590
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,000
You didn't fix it well.

591
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,080
Come.

592
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:21,240
I will fix it for you.

593
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,040
Cheers!

594
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,240
A toast to our thesis project.

595
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:15,320
So strong.

596
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:19,880
And a toast to Mew who finally has a boyfriend.

597
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:21,400
Come on. Not yet.

598
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,000
We're not boyfriends yet.

599
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,520
What do you expect from just a week?

600
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:28,120
Besides, I haven't slept with him yet.

601
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,080
And what are you waiting for?

602
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:34,680
We live in a country where PM 2.5, Covid,

603
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,080
and radioactive cesium take turns to say hi.

604
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,960
We can die any minute.

605
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,440
If you found the right one, you found the right one.

606
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,280
Love doesn't need much time, Mew.

607
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:45,960
Yeah, yeah.

608
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:50,280
Can Top be trusted though?

609
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,800
With work, I'm ok.

610
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:59,280
But with Mew, is he honest?

611
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:03,480
And you Boston,

612
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,280
how did you know him?

613
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:11,440
Do you want me to ask him then

614
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,120
if he just wants to screw Mew?

615
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,280
If you're so worried,

616
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:20,720
why don't you just be his boyfriend?

617
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,200
What shit are you saying?

618
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,400
I'm just afraid he'd be heartbroken.

619
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:26,800
Alright, guys.

620
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,120
I'm a grownup.

621
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:30,320
Don't worry.

622
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,600
Besides, I know how to screen people.

623
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:34,840
Your fault.

624
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,560
Your fault, Boston.

625
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:37,640
Hey, Top.

626
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:38,840
Come here.

627
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,240
I'll be out for a cigarette.

628
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,000
Come on. Sit with us.

629
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,200
Have a seat.

630
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,760
Do you want a drink?

631
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:02,280
Let me get you a glass.

632
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,840
Excuse me, can I have a glass, please?

633
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:06,680
What should we order?

634
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:12,440
Hey.

635
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:15,280
Do you have a lighter?

636
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:20,640
I do.

637
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:22,960
It's probably yours.

638
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:24,880
I got you drunk and robbed you.

639
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:29,560
I'm sorry.

640
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,040
I asked Yo.

641
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:36,120
I misunderstood you.

642
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,080
Why did you have to ask Yo?

643
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,680
Don't I look like I have any credibility?

644
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,080
Why are you upset?

645
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:47,960
You're sulking like we're boyfies.

646
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:55,640
Hey.

647
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:57,360
Let go.

648
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:03,160
I really am sorry.

649
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:09,480
And thanks for saving my life.

650
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,040
Fine. That's all I want.

651
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:20,800
I don't want to hold a grudge or anything.

652
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,800
So can I borrow that lighter now?

653
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:29,920
Sure.

654
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,200
Light it for me.

655
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:04,960
So…

656
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:07,880
You and Mew haven't done it yet.

657
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:10,880
I'm not in a hurry.

658
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:12,480
I got time.

659
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:14,720
I'll get him eventually.

660
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:18,840
He's such a challenge, huh?

661
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:22,160
The more disobedient your prey gets, the more you want him, right?

662
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:24,800
I do not only want to sleep with him,

663
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:29,760
but I also want to date him.

664
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:32,440
He's interesting.

665
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,240
Someone like you wants to date?

666
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:39,840
Yeah?

667
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,440
Someone like what?

668
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:48,640
You and I are the same kind.

669
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:53,280
Don't get his hopes up.

670
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:55,560
If you want to do him, do it and get it over with.

671
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:56,960
I sympathize with my friend.

672
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:01,880
You're concerned about your friend, or you're just jealous?

673
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,280
Ton,

674
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:05,880
I told you.

675
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:09,440
Once is enough for you and me.

676
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:11,920
Or what?

677
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,200
You want more of me?

678
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,560
You're such a narcissist.

679
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:20,840
Watch me.

680
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:23,920
I'm gonna make Mew my boyfriend.

681
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:28,040
Fine.

682
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,640
I'll be there to comfort my friend.

683
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:51,720
Guys.

684
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,840
Please allow me a short interruption.

685
00:49:59,000 --> 00:49:59,720
Can I borrow the mic?

686
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,200
I just want to use this opportunity to tell someone that

687
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:12,480
even though we've only known each other for a short time,

688
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:16,280
I've learned new things from him.

689
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:21,360
For me,

690
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,920
he's such an interesting person

691
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,120
and I want to know more about him.

692
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,560
Gosh, I feel so awkward right now.

693
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:32,560
It's ok.

694
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:34,400
You're hot. It's all fine.

695
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:37,880
What's he doing?

696
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:40,440
Mew.

697
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:44,800
Will you be my boyfriend?

698
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,440
(I've been just the table keeper all my life.)

699
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:01,840
(But tonight, someone in the bar just asked me to be his boyfriend.)

Directed by	Pinya Chookamsri & Tichakorn Phukhaotong

701
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,080
That girl at the bar was cute.

702
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:10,160
Is she your type?

703
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:11,400
I don't have a type.

704
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:13,400
Has any guy hit on you before?

705
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:16,480
Then…

706
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,040
Can you start hitting on me again?

707
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:22,680
I want more.

708
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:25,840
We've done it so many times.

709
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:26,840
What are we to each other now?
