1
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,250
(Beautiful)

2
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,290
(Episode 14)

3
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,630
I'm sorry, I came to the wrong room.

4
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,460
I'm from the next room.

5
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,460
Can I join you guys?

6
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:06,280
Such a beautiful lady.

7
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,120
Of course you can.

8
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:09,440
Come on.

9
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,100
Let's sing together.

10
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:18,580
(Your husband sings with a woman in Golden Year Club)

11
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,680
Mom.

12
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,600
Li Meixing!

13
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:26,100
You rest first.

14
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:27,530
Mom's going out for a bit.

15
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,280
Hey, Li Meixing.

16
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,600
At least wipe it for me.

17
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:35,000
Stop.

18
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:35,700
Stop.

19
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:39,289
Shameless.

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,780
Who is it?

21
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,500
What are you doing here?

22
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:46,180
Our family is in so much debt.

23
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,050
Our son is lying in bed with no one to take care of him.

24
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:50,380
I'm working hard everywhere to make money.

25
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,920
And you're here living it up.

26
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,430
Have you no shame?

27
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,720
You're the shameless one.

28
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:57,670
This family should have broken up long ago.

29
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:58,430
Divorce.

30
00:01:58,670 --> 00:01:59,600
What did you say?

31
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:01,470
You want a divorce?

32
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,220
Not only do I want to divorce you,

33
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,280
I'm also going to sue you in court.

34
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,190
You bankrupted my company.

35
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,100
And transferred my assets.

36
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,120
Now, immediately,

37
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:11,960
get out.

38
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,020
If you keep causing trouble here,

39
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,120
you'd better watch out that I...

40
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,720
I...

41
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,610
If it wasn't for your driving mistake that killed Chen Jinfeng back then,

42
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:21,079
and then you asked me to help you hide it...

43
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:23,310
All of this was for you.

44
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:25,700
Even if I die, I'll drag you down with me.

45
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:26,740
Su.

46
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,650
I'll go out and calm down.

47
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:03,090
Xinyu.

48
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,230
Where is Ruan Su?

49
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,000
I don't know either.

50
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,750
She ran out after seeing the surveillance footage.

51
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,810
I can't reach her on the phone either.

What are you doing here?

89
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,280
I was worried you might do something stupid.

90
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,060
Come with me.

91
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,160
Where to?

92
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,500
I heard Song Yan say before,

93
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,140
when you're feeling down, come to the seaside.

94
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,410
Feel the sea breeze, ride a bike.

95
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:20,700
It'll make you feel better.

96
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,160
I didn't believe it at first.

97
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,090
But it really did get better later.

98
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,830
How about you? Are you feeling better?

99
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,680
No.

100
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:29,980
Alright.

101
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,890
Then I'll keep you company today.

102
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,220
We'll go back when you're feeling better.

103
00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:38,090
I'll go ahead.

104
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,140
Wait for me.

105
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,690
Were you lying to me just now?

106
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:42,840
Speak up.

107
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,420
How did I lie to you?

108
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,360
You always buy these useless things.

109
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,850
You don't get it, do you?

110
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,650
You need to believe in the light.

111
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:58,810
It's exactly the same as what that shop owner said.

112
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:02,950
Let me ask you.

113
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,320
How do you plan to handle this matter?

114
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,400
He will get the punishment he deserves.

115
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,490
I won't show any mercy.

116
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,220
Okay.

117
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:39,630
What are you doing?

118
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,240
Don't you already know?

119
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,760
Why are you suddenly shy?

120
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:44,700
Don't be like this.

121
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,450
I'm starving.

122
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:49,200
Help! Go away!

123
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,450
Bastard!

124
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:54,590
Who are you people?

125
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:55,880
I'm her husband.

126
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,390
Who do you think I am?

127
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,630
Ru, you didn't mention

128
00:07:58,630 --> 00:07:59,530
you have a husband.

129
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:02,190
Looks like this idiot hasn't figured it out yet.

130
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,380
So this is the trick you're playing, huh?

131
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,580
Fine, I'm calling the police right now.

132
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,070
Call the police?

133
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,150
Bro,

134
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,560
don't forget,

135
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:16,130
you're still the boss of an illegally operated company.

136
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:18,060
Should we call the police instead?

137
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,270
Alright, alright.

138
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,120
I'll do what you want.

139
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:26,980
How much do you want?

140
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:29,160
You have three days. 50 million.

141
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,190
50 million?

142
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,840
If you can't get 50 million,

143
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,470
you'll be doomed.
