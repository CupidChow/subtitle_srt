1
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:53,840
Oh right.

2
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,260
You just rest at the hospital for now.

3
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,920
I'll keep an eye on things at the company.

4
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,000
As for Li Meixing,

5
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,560
though she's trying hard to hide it,

6
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,290
we still found out a few things.

7
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,360
I'll keep all this confidential from Bo Xingzhi.

8
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,360
Once you're back,

9
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,289
we'll fully carry out our plan.

10
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,360
Xinyu,

11
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,640
thank you.

12
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,600
I've reviewed

13
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,720
all the patient's medical records.

14
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,880
This patient's condition

15
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,340
is purely caused by shock.

16
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,400
After a few days of rest at home,

17
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,800
everything will be fine.

18
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,680
Just a little scare?

19
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,440
You're doubting my professional judgment?

20
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,280
No, doctor.

21
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,400
Um…

22
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,720
What about the girl brought in yesterday?

23
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,280
Ruan Su, from room 365.

24
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,080
How is she?

25
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,440
Without consent,

26
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,880
we can't disclose a patient's condition.

27
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,650
Doctor! Doctor!

28
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,840
The wound of the patient in room 326 reopened again.

29
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,960
The bleeding won't stop.

30
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,720
Please come check immediately.

31
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,520
Let's go.

32
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,160
Hello?

33
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,880
We found out that the leader of last night's assailants

34
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,840
seems to be an enemy of the Ruan family.

35
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,300
Two suspects are already in police custody.

36
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,160
Xingzhi, you're here.

37
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,720
I feel like my head is starting to spin again.

38
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,320
Can you help me call a doctor?

39
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,040
I don't feel well all over.

40
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,800
The doctor said you're fine.

41
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,040
How is that possible?

42
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,760
I clearly feel that

43
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,680
I'm not well.

44
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,040
Maybe they made a mistake.

45
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,100
Ziyin, why have you become like this?

46
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,530
This is obviously Ruan Su's fault.

47
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,960
Yesterday she was putting on an act all along.

48
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,320
She pretended to be weak in front of me.

49
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,440
Was that how she tricked you before?

50
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,800
Xingzhi, don't be fooled by her again.

51
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,440
I really am innocent.

52
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,520
You should believe me.

53
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,280
Enough.

54
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,420
Don't say anymore.

55
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,160
Go tell Ruan Su

56
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,440
that I came to see her.

57
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,520
Who are you?

58
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,730
Even our boss's name

59
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,610
isn't one you can casually say.

60
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,040
Miss,

61
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,720
please go tell your boss

62
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,160
that Mr. Bo and I are here to visit a patient.

63
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,000
That won't be necessary.

64
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,560
There's no need for you to go in.

65
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,020
Su doesn't want to see you.

66
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,560
I'm her husband.

67
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,720
I have the right to visit her.

68
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,960
And who are you

69
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,640
to make decisions for her?

70
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,850
Where does your confidence come from, Mr. Bo?

71
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,920
The reason you're not allowed in

72
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,200
is Su's decision.

73
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,640
I think,

74
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:54,920
someone else is now

75
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,520
more suited to stay by her side and care for her.

76
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,810
And that person is definitely not you.

77
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,240
And you?

78
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,530
Where does your confidence come from?

79
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,040
Driving?

80
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,220
I'll take you home.

81
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,320
Are you done yet?

82
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,720
I'm just worried about you.

83
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,000
I don't need your concern at all.

84
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,360
Mind your own business.

85
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,600
I think I do need to remind you

86
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,960
we've just

87
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,680
formally ended our marriage.

88
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,659
Please don't harass me again.

89
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,130
Let's have no more contact between us.

90
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,770
Four years of marriage,

91
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,880
Ruan Su, do you really not feel even a little bit of attachment to me?

92
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,960
Xingzhi, I heard you've officially divorced.

93
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,240
Mm.

94
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,960
That's great. Now that she's out of the picture,

95
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,920
you'll have time to keep me company.

96
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,920
How about we...

97
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,600
Ziyin,

98
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,960
I'm a bit busy right now.

99
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,420
I'll find you later, okay?

100
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,840
Xingzhi,

101
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,180
we haven't seen each other in so long.

102
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,040
How about this?

103
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,840
I'll wait here until you finish.

104
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,640
I think you've misunderstood me.

105
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,640
I've always seen you as a sister.

106
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,240
And the company really does have

107
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,120
a lot of matters waiting for me to handle.

108
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,920
I don't have the energy for anything else.

109
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,400
I'm sorry, Xingzhi.

110
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,720
I was too eager.

111
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,680
I'll leave now.

112
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,920
Ziyin, I found out.

113
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,720
Li Meixing is Ruan Su's stepmother.

114
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,580
Ruan Su was abused by her throughout her childhood.

115
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:53,960
Got it.

116
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,800
Welcome back to the Hengjiu Technology family, boss.

117
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,240
Su, happy divorce.

118
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,320
Thank you, everyone.

119
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,800
To celebrate your full return to the team,

120
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,720
we're planning a party.

121
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,380
What ideas do you have?

122
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,840
We'll follow your lead.

123
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,400
I appreciate everyone's kindness.

124
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,480
But divorce

125
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,560
really isn't something worth celebrating.

126
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,400
I think we should focus

127
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,040
on our company's women's safety app.

128
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,400
Let's prioritize our careers.

129
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,000
Then…

130
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,890
Let's wrap it up for now.

131
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,560
Wait.

132
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,840
To thank everyone for your hard work this year,

133
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,880
this year's year-end bonuses will be doubled.

134
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,880
Thank you, boss!

135
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,400
Can you be more careful?

136
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,240
Do you know who I am?

137
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,680
Apologies, Miss Cheng.

138
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,610
Please enjoy it.

139
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,600
You're Cheng Ziyin?

140
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,680
That's me.

141
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,780
Hello, Miss Cheng.

142
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,360
We finally meet.

143
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,440
I think that incident before

144
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,440
was a misunderstanding, right?

145
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,640
Sorry for hurting you last time.

146
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,960
My target

147
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,760
has always been Ruan Su.

148
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,600
Then now we share a common enemy.

149
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,080
What's your plan to deal with her?

150
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,240
Now's not the time.

151
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,380
I have more pressing matters.

152
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:44,200
This talent competition

153
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,920
is jointly hosted by the platform and Hengjiu Technology.

154
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,120
The winning singer

155
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,240
will become the product's spokesperson.

156
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,600
But I recently heard

157
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,500
Bo Group is in contact with Hengjiu Technology.

158
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,880
If I win this competition,

159
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,400
I can help them

160
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,040
connect,

161
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,700
and also gain some resources.

162
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,960
That's easy. I've got a way.

163
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,680
I didn't get the chance to greet Grandma just now.

164
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,040
Is she doing better?

165
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,770
She's recovering well.

166
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,040
That's good. Oh, right,

167
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,280
the list of singers for today's competition

168
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,340
was just released.

169
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,680
Cheng Ziyin is on it too.

170
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,600
Do you want me to intervene and make her withdraw?

171
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,080
No need.

172
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,760
Our original intent in holding this competition

173
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,880
was to select

174
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,280
the most suitable spokesperson for our new product.

175
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,409
Everyone should have an equal chance.

176
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,799
Cheng Ziyin is no exception.

177
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,120
Understood.
