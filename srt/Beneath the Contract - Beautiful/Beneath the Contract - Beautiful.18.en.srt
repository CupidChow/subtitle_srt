1
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:41,170
(Beautiful)

2
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:43,310
(Episode 18)

3
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,560
Xingzhi.

4
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,000
If only Grandpa had known this earlier.

5
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,040
Grandpa.

6
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,440
Why are you here?

7
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,280
What are you reading?

8
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,590
You still have the nerve to ask?

9
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:07,810
All these years,

10
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:09,390
you kept me and my grandson

11
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:11,270
completely in the dark.

12
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,640
Now you want to use the favor of saving his life to tie Xingzhi to you

13
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,980
and ruin their marriage?

14
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,410
Do you really think

15
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,390
you can fool everyone?

16
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,440
No, Grandpa...

17
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:22,720
Don't call me Grandpa!

18
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,710
I can't carry this burden.

19
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,210
Our Bo family

20
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,240
can't accept

21
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,100
someone like you,

22
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,420
a woman full of lies,

23
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:31,550
vicious and ruthless.

24
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:33,650
Now,

25
00:01:33,729 --> 00:01:35,390
I'm going to let Xingzhi know,

26
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,400
know what kind of woman you are!

27
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,190
No, Grandpa!

28
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,440
You can't tell Xingzhi.

29
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,470
-Get out of my way.
-Please!

30
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:41,720
-You can't tell Xingzhi!
-Move.

31
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,560
I can't live without him.

32
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,900
You vicious woman!

33
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,160
You...

34
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,030
You...

35
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,080
I...

36
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:54,470
I... I didn't mean to, Grandpa.

37
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,880
Mr. Yang, where's Grandpa?

38
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:59,020
Old Mr. Bo is in the living room.

39
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,370
He's been talking about you every day lately.

40
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,570
He really misses you.

41
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:02,700
Go see him quickly.

42
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:21,020
Grandpa.

43
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,170
Grandpa!

44
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:29,110
Quick, call an ambulance!

45
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:29,960
Grandpa.

46
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:30,670
Grandpa!

47
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:31,310
Grandpa!

48
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,590
Xingzhi.

49
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:37,870
Ziyin!

50
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,200
Ruan Su!

51
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:43,770
If what I did before

52
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,460
made you feel uncomfortable,

53
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,880
I apologize to you.

54
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:48,250
But you really didn't have to

55
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,100
go to such extremes.

56
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,380
Don't waste precious treatment time.

57
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,050
It wasn't me.

58
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:05,560
I believe it wasn't you.

59
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,770
Hello, ma'am.

60
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,220
Regarding the accident that just happened,

61
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,350
there are some things I need to ask you.

62
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:14,990
Yesterday, the head of the Bo family was attacked,

63
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:15,170
and is currently in critical condition.

64
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:16,430
(Nurse Station)
and is currently in critical condition.

65
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:16,450
(Nurse Station)

66
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,720
As the prime suspect in this case, Ruan Su's
(Nurse Station)

67
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,920
identity has been exposed.

68
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,730
Master Su, the expert traditional Chinese medicine practitioner,

69
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:24,750
the behind-the-scenes boss of Hengjiu Tech,

70
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,820
and the martial arts master Yin Xiang.

71
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,380
Which one is her true identity?

72
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,920
Reportedly, Ruan Su

73
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,280
and Bo heir Bo Xingzhi divorced several months ago.

74
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,079
Netizens have been speculating

75
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,360
that she may harbour resentment

76
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,480
over the Bo's family abandonment,

77
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,620
or perhaps she coveted the Bo family's assets,

78
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,579
resulting in her actions.

79
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,290
Feeling any better?

80
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,020
No, not at all.

81
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,140
Yesterday,

82
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,580
what exactly happened?

83
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,580
Why were you at the old estate?

84
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,560
I've been texting you

85
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,240
but you never replied.

86
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,760
I saw you weren't at home,

87
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,630
so I went to the old estate to look for you.

88
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,810
Xingzhi,

89
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,800
you won't be angry with me

90
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,000
just because I didn't tell you I was going to the old estate

91
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,320
to find you, right?

92
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,370
And then?

93
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:20,690
Then it was just as you all saw.

94
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:23,530
Grandpa and I are both victims.

95
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:25,530
I'm so useless.

96
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,810
I didn't protect Grandpa.

97
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,840
But I really didn't expect

98
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,440
Ruan Su to be so heartless.

99
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,760
You didn't see her at the time.

100
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,430
I'm still scared when I think about it now.

101
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:40,770
However,

102
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:43,090
you probably won't believe me anymore.

103
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:44,990
Don't worry.

104
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,520
I’ll find the person responsible

105
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,720
for hurting Grandpa.

106
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:54,350
Alright,

107
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:55,770
you should get some rest.

108
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,230
He won't find out the truth, will he?

109
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:14,800
I've identified some people who have been gossiping about you behind your back.

110
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,840
I'll fire them.

111
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:17,200
Forget it.

112
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,820
They didn’t know better.

113
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:19,760
Besides,

114
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,980
I've come back safe and sound, haven't I?

115
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,040
Easy for you to say.

116
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,390
Although we've already issued a clarification statement,

117
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:28,250
netizens don't believe it at all.

118
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,440
They're even spreading rumors that

119
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,280
that you only got away

120
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,750
because of money and power.

121
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,310
Public opinion is a fearsome thing.

122
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,970
Are you sure it's really okay?

123
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,600
People always tend to believe

124
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,060
what they want to believe.

125
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:41,400
As long as I have a clear conscience, that's enough.

126
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:47,790
It smells so good.

127
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:53,690
By the way, Grandma,

128
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,370
why didn’t you ask me anything

129
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:57,030
about the false accusations?

130
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,480
Grandma doesn't believe in

131
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,080
those baseless rumors at all.

132
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,540
You're my granddaughter.

133
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:04,880
I know what kind of person you are better than anyone.

134
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,460
After going through this ordeal,

135
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:16,520
you must have some resentment in your heart.

136
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,110
So don't keep it bottled up.

137
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:21,230
You should follow your heart

138
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:23,040
and do what you want to do.

139
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,400
I understand.

140
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,390
Why are you here?

141
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:41,380
I'm here to see Grandpa.

142
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,060
My grandmother's chicken soup.

143
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:45,620
I brought it for him.

144
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,580
You should go back.

145
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:49,960
I've already arranged

146
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,510
24-hour care for Grandpa.

147
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,750
Besides, Grandpa’s condition is unstable.

148
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,430
It's not convenient for outsiders to visit.

149
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,460
Xingzhi,

150
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:57,330
(Operating Room) (Treatment Room)

151
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:59,740
I'm here to see if Grandpa is feeling better.
(Operating Room) (Treatment Room)

152
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,280
Isn't your injury still healing?

153
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,810
Don't move around too much.

154
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,530
Don't be so anxious.

155
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,420
Thanks to your attentive care,

156
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,160
my injury is healing quickly.

157
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:09,460
Alright, Ms. Ruan,

158
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,590
you should go.

159
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:13,180
We can take care of Grandpa ourselves.

160
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:15,210
Let's go.

161
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,520
Bo Xingzhi, what are you planning?

162
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,920
The news of Old Mr. Bo's critical condition

163
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,380
are spreading like wildfire.

164
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,130
Bo's Group’s stocks are plunging.

165
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:31,590
The outlook doesn’t look good.

166
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:33,180
Don't worry about that for now.

167
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,450
Hasty actions may lead to misjudgments.

168
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,060
Let's stay calm first.

169
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:38,100
We'll discuss it when the time comes.

170
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,200
But it seems the Huo family

171
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,730
has been secretly getting people to buy Bo's Group's stocks.

172
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,630
We have to take action.

173
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,900
Perhaps I can be of help.

174
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:54,500
Oh no.

175
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:56,280
The earrings Mom left me.

176
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:58,970
What are you trying to do?

177
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,290
The Cheng family and the Huo family are actually old allies.

178
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:05,030
Although my relationship with my family isn't great right now,
