1
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,280
(Beautiful)

2
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,350
(Episode 17)

3
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:49,340
Mr. Bo,

4
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,400
your custom ring is here.

5
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:52,460
By the way,

6
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:54,270
how did you get that piece of evidence?

7
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,000
I made a deal with them.

8
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,880
If they told me everything Ruan Xinhua had done,

9
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,570
I'd pay off his debt.

10
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:01,690
You're really planning to

11
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:03,090
pay it off for him?

12
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:07,090
Do you really take me as an ATM?

13
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:08,890
Give all the evidence

14
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:09,690
to the police.

15
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,020
We can't keep

16
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:13,850
this kind of evil organization.

17
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:17,190
Mr. Bo,

18
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,440
who's the ring

19
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:20,590
for?

20
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:27,250
I plan to pursue Su again.

21
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:31,590
It all comes down to

22
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,690
the face,

23
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,440
especially mine from a 45-degree angle.

24
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,970
That's peak handsomeness.

25
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,630
What's gotten into you in broad daylight?

26
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,460
Beauty,

27
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:47,180
let's have a meal together.

28
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:48,310
What?

29
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:51,620
Let's have a meal together.

30
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:54,800
Sorry, I've already got plans.

31
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:56,630
With whom?

32
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,740
Guy or girl? How old?

33
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,080
Mr. Han from Baisheng Building Materials.

34
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:05,500
I know Mr. Han well.

35
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,420
I've been in the business world for years.

36
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,949
Let me give you some advice.

37
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:09,650
Come on.

38
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:10,850
Come on.

39
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:20,550
That outfit is awful.

40
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:21,650
Go change it.

41
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,480
Got it.

42
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,190
Mr. Han,

43
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:35,670
I've heard so much about you.

44
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:36,360
I'm not Mr. Han.

45
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,630
This is Mr. Han.

46
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,520
Hello, Mr. Han.

47
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,460
So you're Ruan Su?

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,560
I didn't expect you so beautiful and capable.

49
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,040
And who is this?

50
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:53,210
This is my assistant.

51
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:55,310
I hope you don't mind.

52
00:02:55,329 --> 00:02:56,940
I don't mind,

53
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,800
but

54
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,780
but with that baby face

55
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,000
he doesn't exactly scream competence.

56
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,940
Mr. Han, shall we take a seat?

57
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:06,170
Come on.

58
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:15,510
Have a seat.

59
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,360
Please, sit.

60
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,920
Ms. Ruan, a small gift

61
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,470
for our first meeting. Hope you'll accept it.

62
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:28,010
Mr. Han,

63
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,570
you're too kind.

64
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,530
Sorry about this.

65
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:33,810
She's allergic to men.

66
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:35,079
I'll just hold onto it for now.

67
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:36,800
Allergic to men?

68
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:39,079
I've never heard of that before.

69
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,480
Mr. Han, shall we start eating?

70
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,850
Okay, let's eat.

71
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:44,780
Please try this.

72
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,420
Alright.

73
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:48,960
I've heard Ms. Ruan is straightforward.

74
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,560
Meeting you today proves

75
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,490
your reputation is well deserved.

76
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,140
You...

77
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:56,170
It seems to me you're here to flirt,

78
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,140
ot to talk business.

79
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,890
A man like Mr. Han, who uses

80
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,480
partnership as an excuse to

81
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,400
get handsy with women,

82
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,200
is in no position to work with us.

83
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,060
Outrageous!

84
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,880
You can take this deal and discuss it

85
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,950
with whoever you want.

86
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:13,570
Let's go!

87
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,030
Mr. Han!

88
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:23,000
Look at the mess you've made.

89
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,160
Don't tell me you really don't know

90
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,280
what he was getting at.

91
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:25,880
Forget it.

92
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,100
Let's eat.

93
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,180
I had a nightmare last night.

94
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,720
Do you want to know what it was?

95
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,440
What was it?

96
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:34,490
A dream without you in it.

97
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,150
Let's eat.

98
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,090
You know,

99
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,670
ever since I met you,

100
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,280
I can only throw scissors

101
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,920
in rock-paper-scissors.

102
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:51,580
Because you are my everything.

103
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,500
Oh come on, are you done?

104
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,960
You didn't come up with that line yourself, did you?

105
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,780
I admit, I borrowed it a little.

106
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:01,130
Are you going to say,

107
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,080
"But my feelings for you are real"?

108
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:04,590
How did you know?

109
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,560
That's so cheesy.

110
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,390
Come on, let's just eat properly.

111
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,390
Okay.

112
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,520
Let's eat.

113
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,690
I've met Li Meixing a few times before.

114
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,030
But things

115
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,590
have been quiet lately.

116
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,900
I knew Ziyin

117
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,860
wasn't as innocent as she seemed.

118
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:31,000
It turns out she's been pulling strings behind the scenes.

119
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,480
Also, when we

120
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,380
showed the villagers a photo of Cheng Ziyin,

121
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,540
none of them

122
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,240
recognized her.

123
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,600
But based on their descriptions,

124
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,350
I identified another girl.

125
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,920
After verifying,

126
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,590
we confirmed that

127
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,110
she's actually Ruan Su.

128
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,050
Are you alright?

129
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:58,800
Wake up.

130
00:05:59,010 --> 00:05:59,900
Wake up!

131
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:16,830
My master is still waiting for me.

132
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:19,990
That's right.

133
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,870
It's all fate.

134
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,770
Fate indeed.

135
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,890
The Best Musician award goes to Xuehai.

136
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,920
Now, let's welcome

137
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,760
the Chairwoman of Hengjiu Tech, Ruan Su,

138
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,990
to present the award.

139
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,300
Congratulations.

140
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:41,440
If nothing else works,

141
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,060
try playing hard to get.

142
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:46,330
Show you care, then pull away.

143
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:49,500
Whatever you do, don't reach out first.

144
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,550
Today, on this stage,

145
00:06:56,909 --> 00:06:58,490
I want to thank someone—

146
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,840
Ruan Su.

147
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,420
Thank you for all your support.

148
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:05,850
I hope you'll give me a chance to pursue you.

149
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:10,750
What nonsense about playing hard to get.

150
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,010
You must be tired too.

151
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:16,770
Go home and get some rest.

152
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,640
Xuehai,

153
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:22,080
I think

154
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,680
I should be clear with you.

155
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,990
Being friends with you

156
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,720
makes me really happy.

157
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,280
But I

158
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,360
really can't give you what you want.

159
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,350
I'm sure

160
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:33,760
you don't want to

161
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,620
rush into a relationship either.

162
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,060
I understand.

163
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:41,350
Don't feel pressured.

164
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:43,480
Thank you.

165
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,480
Well,

166
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,700
