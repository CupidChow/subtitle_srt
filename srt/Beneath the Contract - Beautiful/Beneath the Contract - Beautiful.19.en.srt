1
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:41,200
(Beautiful)

2
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,220
(Episode 19)

3
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:47,740
Do I look beautiful today?

4
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,130
You look stunning.

5
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:50,860
You're the most beautiful bride
I've ever seen.

6
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:53,260
You're definitely going to stun everyone.

7
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:55,380
From now on,

8
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,450
Xingzhi is mine.

9
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,210
No one can take him away from me.

10
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:01,960
Darling, happy wedding day.

11
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:03,170
Happy wedding day.

12
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:04,790
What are you guys doing here?

13
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:07,740
You're getting engaged to the eldest
young master of the Bo's Group.

14
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,680
As your besties, how could we not show up?

15
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,340
Yes.

16
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,120
Exactly.

17
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,680
You really think you're worthy?

18
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,190
But wasn't it a bit sudden

19
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,920
to make such an important decision?

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,330
Well, you'll have to ask Mr. Bo about that.

21
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,560
After all, he didn't want

22
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,700
other quality men to snatch me up.

23
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,750
That's why I hurried to quit the industry—

24
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,090
to give you three

25
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,060
a chance.

26
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:32,430
We were blind before.

27
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,600
Please don't stay mad at us.

28
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,220
The bride and groom,
please exchange your rings

29
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:43,020
as a symbol of your unwavering love.

30
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:46,990
Let's give them a big round of applause
to send them our best wishes!

31
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,100
I know you're eager to continue.

32
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:53,450
But what can we do?

33
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,600
Our witness

34
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,860
doesn't approve of this marriage at all.

35
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,400
(A month ago)

36
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,160
Ruan Su.
(A month ago)

37
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:06,890
(A month ago)

38
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:08,830
I want to talk to you.

39
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,360
I still think

40
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,770
something's not right about Grandpa.

41
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,690
Whether it was Cheng Ziyin's reaction

42
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:16,730
or Mr. Yang's—

43
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,020
something feels off.

44
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,210
Mr. Yang?

45
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,790
He used to be grandfather's steward,

46
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:25,620
but he resigned immediately
after the incident.

47
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,790
So you're saying Mr. Yan and Cheng Ziyin…

48
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:36,760
That's why I agreed to the engagement
with the Cheng family.

49
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:38,410
At the engagement party,

50
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:40,760
I'll expose

51
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,470
Cheng Ziyin's true colors

52
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:43,740
once and for all.

53
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,070
She'll completely fall out with her family,

54
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,990
get what she deserves,

55
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,920
and she'll never bother me again.

56
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,310
As for Grandpa,

57
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,960
I've already contacted several experts.

58
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,690
They'll work out a plan

59
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,730
with the lowest possible risk
for his condition.

60
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:03,360
Go ahead and carry out
your plan with confidence.

61
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,120
Alright.

62
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:15,460
Mr. Bo.

63
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,310
The car... the car has arrived.

64
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,520
Then I'll go in first.

65
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,040
The car has really arrived.

66
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:36,840
Just you wait!

67
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,310
Can't you read the room?

68
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,970
Mr. Bo, we've found Mr. Yang.

69
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
He's right here.

70
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,210
Let's get in the car first.

71
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:47,950
Young Master?

72
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,500
Mr. Yang.

73
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:53,000
You said you wanted to resign and go home
to take care of your mother.

74
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,540
Why did I hear that your mother

75
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,150
passed away a year ago?

76
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,740
I'm sorry, Young Master.

77
00:03:58,940 --> 00:03:59,950
I was wrong.

78
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:02,130
As long as you tell me everything,

79
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,810
I can let it go.

80
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,960
This is evidence of Cheng Ziyin

81
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,650
secretly colluding with Li Meixing.

82
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:09,920
It also proves that

83
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,250
Cheng Ziyin is not the person

84
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,650

what are you talking about?

148
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,840
I don't understand.

149
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,100

and clean up all the evidence,

153
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:02,270
they would pay me a large sum of money.

154
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:04,300
That's not enough!

155
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,870
Welcome, everyone.

156
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,770
Are you surprised by my

157
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,620
sudden appearance?

158
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,010
A month ago,

159
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,040
it was this Miss Cheng

160
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,590
who pushed me to the ground,

161
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,600
causing me a sudden heart attack.

162
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,560
I didn't.

163
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,159
I almost died because of it.

164
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,760
Her goal was

165
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,110
to destroy the evidence.

166
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:41,750
She was afraid I would expose her misdeeds.

167
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:44,750
Didn't expect this, Miss Cheng?

168
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,159
I actually

169
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,110
came back

170
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,250
safe and sound.

171
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,680
I'm very sorry.

172
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:52,340
From today on,

173
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,170
you can no longer shift the blame
onto others,

174
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,540
because I

175
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,120
am the evidence!

176
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,830
A murderer?

177
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:01,840
Yes.

178
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,360
I didn't do it!

179
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,680
I was forced to do all of this.

180
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:06,500
Xingzhi,

181
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,190
you...

182
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,130
you have to believe me.

183
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:11,210
Please believe me!

184
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,980
You still won't admit it even now?

185
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:19,500
Don't touch me!

186
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,340
So dramatic.

187
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,120
Xingzhi,

188
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,770
I gave up everything for you

189
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,770
and humbled myself to beg my family.

190
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:34,890
Why did you...

191
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:35,970
Cheng Ziyin.

192
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:40,090
You finally came.

193
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:40,920
What did you

194
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,850
call me here for?

195
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:45,050
Can't you see?

196
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,020
I don't want to live anymore.

197
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:49,840
Whatever.

198
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,460
Whatever you want to do

199
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:52,900
has nothing to do with me.

200
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,659
Nothing to do with you?

201
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:57,620
You stole my Xingzhi.

202
00:07:57,909 --> 00:07:59,800
You ruined everything I had.

203
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,080
You put me

204
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,800
in this situation I'm in now!

205
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,330
How could you say
it has nothing to do with you?

206
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:06,430
Playing that card again?

207
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:07,930
Fine.

208
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,200
Then jump.

209
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:10,640
After you die,

210
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,810
your precious Xingzhi will be all mine.

211
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:14,270
Don't even think about it.

212
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,800
Do you know what kind of situation

213
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,240
I'm in right now?

214
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,220
If I tell the police

215
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,280
everything,

216
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:23,620
everyone will treat me like a joke!

217
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,070
Aren't you usually pretty smart?

218
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:33,370
Why do you care so much about
what others think?

219
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:35,000
Once you're out of prison,

220
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,809
everything can start over.

221
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,370
Really?

222
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:43,840
Really.
