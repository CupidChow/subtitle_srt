1
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,880
Isn’t that the youngest daughter of Cheng Enterprise,

2
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,340
just entering the entertainment industry?

3
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:03,390
Please come over here and take a photo.

4
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,510
Why is she with the CEO of the Bo Group?

5
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:25,400
Isn’t that Mr. Jiang?

6
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,200
He has a girlfriend now?

7
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,000
I’ve never seen her before,

8
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
where did she come from?

9
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,950
But she is pretty.

10
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:31,150
Is she some international star?

11
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:31,789
Mr. Jiang.

12
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:34,200
Take a photo, Mr. Jiang.

13
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:42,430
Why is she here?

14
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:43,759
Take a photo, Mr. Jiang.

15
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:48,000
Looks like I’m just here to be your backdrop.

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,130
I wouldn’t dare steal your spotlight.

17
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,910
I heard you are also in talks with Hengjiu Technology.

18
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,310
They’ve independently developed

19
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,360
dozens of high-tech innovations in just 2 years.

20
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,079
They're not to be underestimated.

21
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:18,470
But their company demands too much.

22
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,910
So far, no company seems to be able to

23
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,120
catch their eyes.

24
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,590
I also heard

25
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,470
their CEO is a woman.

26
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:26,680
A woman?

27
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,770
You didn’t know?

28
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,280
Xingzhi.

29
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,590
Ruan Su is really popular.

30
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,390
So many men are surrounding her.

31
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,079
No wonder she proposed a divorce so quickly.

32
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:54,680
Looks like she already found her next partner.

33
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,110
Ziyin, wait for me here for a bit.

34
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:06,630
No wonder

35
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,680
you proposed a divorce so quickly.

36
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,870
Looks like you already found your next partner.

37
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,670
What’s better about him than me?

38
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,280
Sober up.

39
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,550
Mr. Bo is making a scene in public with his ex-wife.

40
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,520
Isn’t that a bit inappropriate?

41
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,630
We haven’t officially divorced yet.

42
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,120
Right.

43
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:25,630
Speaking of that.

44
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,079
Bo Xingzhi.

45
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,910
When are you going to sign it?

46
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:32,750
Did you

47
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,560
change your mind?

48
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,810
That’s not the case.

49
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,360
Then please sign it

50
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,520
as soon as possible.

51
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,630
Are you okay?

52
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,240
I’m fine, Xingzhi.

53
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,630
Ms. Ruan didn’t mean to trip me.

54
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,840
It was my mistake.

55
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:01,310
Ms. Ruan.

56
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,840
Are you alright?

57
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,840
Ruan Su, apologize to Ziyin.

58
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,430
You really want me to apologize?

59
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,710
Take out your anger on me.

60
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,130
Don’t drag innocent people into this.

61
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,750
How boring.

62
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,040
So far,

63
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,720
which company do you think

64
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,430
meets our requirements?

65
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,830
For now,

66
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,850
Bo Group is the most suitable.

67
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,650
The terms they’ve offered are also good.

68
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,390
Don't consider the Bo Group.

69
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,659
Their boss has a bad personality.

70
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:46,430
And he doesn't seem to be very smart.

71
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,950
When did you

72
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,700
start to bring personal emotions into work?

73
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,480
What?

74
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,480
I'm the boss.

75
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,930
Don’t I have that right?

76
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,190
You’re right, I’ll listen to you.

77
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:02,270
And I fully support you.

78
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:11,630
Xinyu.

79
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,920
I’m a bit tired.

80
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,710
I want to go for a walk.

81
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,190
I’ll accompany you.

82
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,040
No need.

83
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,680
I’ll go alone.

84
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,120
Alright.

85
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:23,920
Find out

86
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,390
if he showed up.

87
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,270
Yes.

88
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,830
Don’t waste your time.

89
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:31,370
We refuse to cooperate with Bo Group.

90
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,240
Oh, by the way.

91
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,380
I forgot to introduce myself.

92
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,870
I’m the General Manager of Hengjiu Technology,

93
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,000
Jiang Xinyu.

94
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,600
Why didn't you tell me?

95
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,400
Sorry, Mr. Bo.

96
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,280
I didn't find out about this.

97
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,159
Mr. Jiang.

98
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:50,800
Bo Group

99
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,120
believes that our terms

100
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,980
are the best among all companies.

101
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,590
What right do you have

102
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,600
to make decisions for your boss?

103
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,400
This is the decision of our boss.

104
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:03,600
The Bo Group has poor judgment.

105
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,430
Especially you, Mr. Bo.

106
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:08,270
Our boss doesn’t want to negotiate with you.

107
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,480
Let me give you some advice.

108
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,630
Stop flirting

109
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,120
with your little lover.

110
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:18,320
You should investigate the truth
when you have time.

111
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:41,720
Mr. Bo.

112
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:42,870
Should I play it again?

113
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:43,480
No need.

114
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:53,520
Where are you going?

115
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:54,480
Brother.

116
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,240
You are alone?

117
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:01,360
Well, the sun’s coming out from the west today.

118
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,390
Then it’s just right.

119
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,680
Let’s go eat together.

120
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:04,830
Go away.

121
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,480
Watch your mouth.

122
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,240
Hey, my bros are here.

123
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:12,040
Show me some respect, okay?

124
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,270
Yeah, yeah.

125
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,240
Let’s go eat. Go.

126
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,040
Go.

127
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:17,750
I warn you,

128
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,220
don’t touch me.

129
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,510
My sister.

130
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,200
She’s like this at home.

131
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,390
I touched you.

132
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,160
So what?

133
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,550
I touched you.

134
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,040
Again.

135
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:34,430
Are you okay, bro?

136
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:36,800
Beat her.

137
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,070
Don't you dare touch her!

138
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,480
What did you say?

139
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,240
I can’t hear you.

140
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,680
I touched her.

141
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,240
So what?

142
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,159
Get out.

143
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:53,390
Don’t make me say it twice.

144
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,480
Even if you say it 8 times,

145
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,950
we still won’t listen to you.

146
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:56,750
We have so many people,

147
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,120
and you think you can beat us?

148
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,800
Ruan Xinjian, tell your lackey to get lost.

149
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,920
Get back here.

150
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,040
Go.

151
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:05,950
Go, big brother.

152
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:06,720
Go.

153
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,310
Are you okay?

154
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,750
Stop pretending you care about me.

155
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,480
I’m not pretending.

156
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,270
Are you hurt?

157
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,180
None of your business.

158
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,560
I came to apologize.

159
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,490
I misunderstood you earlier.

160
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,430
I don’t need it.

161
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:32,559
Big brother.

162
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:34,360
You were scared as soon as he appeared.

163
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,559
You asked us to leave.

164
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,390
You’re really afraid of him?

165
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:39,390
I really want to shoot you right now.

166
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,440
If you guys had acted sooner,

167
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,320
would there have been all this mess?

168
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,790
What do I pay

169
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:45,840
you guys for?

170
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:51,970
Big brother.

171
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,750
How is it?

172
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,200
You tell me.

173
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,630
It must be fine.

174
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,240
Not good.

175
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:05,270
Look.

176
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:09,150
This girl is good.

177
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:10,630
What do you think?

178
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,440
What are you guys doing?

179
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,030
Girl,

180
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,510
we just want to invite you for a drink.

181
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:20,870
Let’s go.
