(Beautiful)

00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:43,180
(Episode 20)

3
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,960
You're usually pretty smart.

4
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:52,980
Why will you care about what others think?

5
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,050
Once you're out,

6
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,800
you can start over.

7
00:00:58,170 --> 00:00:59,280
Really?

8
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:03,740
Really.

9
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:08,880
Alright.

10
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:15,170
Die with me!

11
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:34,210
Quick!

12
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,400
Today, top influencer
Cheng Ziyin fell from a building.

13
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,940
She sustained multiple fractures.

14
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,250
The police have initially ruled

15
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:45,229
that Cheng Ziyin
committed suicide out of guilt.

16
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:45,840
Grandpa,

17
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:47,539
didn't we say

18
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:49,340
you weren't supposed to go to the wedding?

19
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,950
Why did you sneak off again?

20
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,390
What do you mean "sneak off"?

21
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,930
Today was the day I was discharged.

22
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,100
I just wanted

23
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,100
to see that girl

24
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,410
get what she deserves with my own eyes.

25
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,930
Just hearing her name makes me mad.

26
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,750
Alright, Grandpa.

27
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,870
Let bygones be bygones.

28
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,220
Didn't I tell you

29
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,520
to get some rest

30
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,950
and watch your emotions?

31
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:14,640
Okay.

32
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,560
I will listen to you.

33
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:18,329
But

34
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,520
you have to promise me one thing.

35
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,850
In a few days,

36
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,870
have a meal with me.

37
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,130
Last time,

38
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,250
we didn't really get to catch up.

our family is having a dinner gathering.

48
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:04,850
As you all know,

49
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,300
recently the Bo family

50
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,720
went through a lot.

51
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:09,880
Fortunately,

52
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,000
we made it through.

53
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,360
I hope that starting today,

54
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,660
our Bo family

55
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:18,040
can have a fresh start,

56
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,440
and reach new heights.

57
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,570
Let's all

58
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,360
raise our glasses

59
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,090
and wish for Bo Group's

60
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,810
continued growth and success.

61
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:26,420
Come on.

62
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,420
Let's celebrate
Grandpa's recovery and discharge.

63
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:28,810
Good.

64
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:30,660
Cheers to Grandpa's
long life and good health!

65
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,140
Alright.

66
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,000
I'll drink it all.

67
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,800
Cheers!

68
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,220
Su.

69
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,000
I haven't seen you in a while.

70
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,160
You've lost weight.

71
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,640
How about getting back with Xingzhi

72
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,340
and helping the Bo family

73
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,700
keep thriving?

74
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:44,850
No need.

75
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,680
Whether past or present,

76
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:50,110
I've never lived my life depending on a man.

77
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:53,770
Grandpa,

78
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:56,280
I have another dinner to attend.

79
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,130
Alright.

80
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,400
Su,

81
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:00,380
no matter what you do,

82
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:01,850
I support you.

83
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,000
Thank you, Grandpa.

84
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,410
Come on, let's eat.

85
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:09,430
Grandpa,

86
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,610
I'm going after your granddaughter-in-law.

87
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,970
I apologize on my aunt's behalf.

88
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,490
There's nothing to apologize for.

89
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:23,200
It has nothing to do with you.

90
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,490
Let me give you a ride.

91
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:27,020
Wait here, I'll get the car.

92
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,610
Isn't that Ruan Su?

93
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,340
You are...

94
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,610
Didn't you see the message
in the group chat?

95
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,540
We have a class reunion here today.

96
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:42,470
Xiang Qi.

97
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,740
Long time no see.

98
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,560
Since you knew

99
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,690
we were eating at the same restaurant,

100
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,880
why didn't you say hi?

101
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:51,350
I think she just didn't dare.

102
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,000
Who's the boss you're drinking

103
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,380
with today?

104
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,320
When will us

105
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,280
old classmates

106
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,990
get to attend your wedding?

107
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,400
Whether you'll make it to my wedding

108
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,680
depends on your luck.

109
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:02,450
You...

110
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,090
What a small world.

111
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,930
Still not getting along, huh?

112
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:07,930
Honestly, back then,

113
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,680
how did Mr. Bo ever fall for you?

114
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,200
You must've used

115
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:13,060
some shady tricks

116
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:14,610
to force him

117
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,310
into marrying you.

118
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,340
No way, Ruan Su.

119
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,890
So those rumors online were true?

120
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,010
You're right.

121
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,160
You just got it backwards.

122
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,240
I'm the one who used shady tricks.

123
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:30,630
I threatened and harassed her.

124
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:32,860
If you have a problem,

125
00:05:33,409 --> 00:05:35,180
feel free to come to
Bo Group and talk to me.

126
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,240
And one more thing,

127
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,720
she's my woman.

128
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,860
What are you laughing at?

129
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,590
Seen too many
dominant male lead dramas, huh?

130
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,800
Girls these days
don't buy into that crap anymore.

131
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,400
Oh right,

132
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:00,980
just to be clear,

133
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:03,240
I don't belong to anyone.

134
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,010
I belong only to myself.

135
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,860
Fine.

136
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:09,960
But it's true

137
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,560
you're my ex-wife, isn't it?

138
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:13,990
That's right.

139
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,200
Get in.

140
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,240

145
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,040
Grandma,

146
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,900
these fruits...

147
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,330
They were all sent by Xingzhi.

148
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,790
While you were gone,

149
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,260
he worried I'd get bored

150
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,160
and often came by to chat.

151
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:17,150
Every time, he'd bring
several boxes of fruit.

152
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,860
Look, how could I possibly finish them all?

153
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,670
What are you doing?

154
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,710
Why aren't you replying to my messages?

155
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,310
Busy?

156
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,030
Don't forget to eat on time.

157
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:28,670
And don't stay up too late.

158
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,820
Grandma,

159
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,230
I'm heading out for a bit.

160
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:31,870
Go on,

161
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:32,740
go on.

162
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,420
Thanks for everything

163
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,720
you've done for my grandma during this time.

164
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,120
And for all the fruit.

165
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,210
Xingzhi,

166
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,550
I want to tell you something.

167
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,660
I want

168
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:08,060
to keep pursuing entrepreneurship,

169
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,430
go to another city,

170
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,840
and grow the business.

171
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:20,650
I agree you shouldn't stop here.

172
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,030
I fully support

173
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,780
your decision.

174
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:26,860
Thank you.

175
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:30,400
Even though I don't know if it'll work out,

176
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,600
I still want to try.

177
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,570
I believe in you.

178
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:35,090
But I have one condition.

179
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:37,070
I want to be the sole investor

180
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,419
in your company.

181
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:40,580
Even if it loses money, I don't care.

182
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:45,480
What kind of investment
are we talking about?

183
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:49,480
I'll have to think it over.

184
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,460
Alright, think it over.

185
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,720
Do you think

186
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,370
this is another push-and-pull tactic?

187
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:09,830
