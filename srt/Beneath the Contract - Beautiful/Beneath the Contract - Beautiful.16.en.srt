1
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,230
(Beautiful)

2
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:43,100
(Episode 16)

3
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:50,850
She's much better now.

4
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,320
She can be discharged in a couple of days.

5
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,820
Thank you, doctor.

6
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:57,980
While we're at it,

7
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:00,470
let's take grandma back to our hometown.

8
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:01,890
Back to the hometown?

9
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:03,800
So suddenly?

10
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:05,860
Just to relax a bit.

11
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,560
It'll be good for

12
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,880
grandma's recovery.

13
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,380
That's a good idea.

14
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:11,990
We haven't been back in years.

15
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:13,590
I really want to see

16
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,920
how things have changed.

17
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,190
Alright, then we'll do as you say.

18
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,680
Get in.

19
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,600
Let's go.

20
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:40,259
Nothing's changed.

21
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:41,330
Not at all.

22
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:42,750
Of course not.

23
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:43,880
During those years we stayed there,

24
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,410
I made sure everything
was well taken care of.

25
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,020
Thanks, Xingzhi.

26
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:49,630
Otherwise, I wouldn't even know

27
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,720
if I could come back again.

28
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:53,560
As long as you're happy.

29
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:55,770
Let's go.

30
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:11,790
Madam, how much is this?

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,390
Ruan Su.

32
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,370
You've brought your boyfriend back?

33
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:16,550
This is my friend.

34
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:20,230
You deliberately sent grandma away, right?

35
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,350
Grandma's health isn't great.

36
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,350
We can handle buying the groceries.

37
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:25,810
Five yuan.

38
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,140
Keep the change.

39
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,120
Can you give us a discount?

40
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:34,340
Small business, no discounts.

41
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,290
That old man over there was selling for
just three yuan half a kilo.

42
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,390
If you can't give me a discount,

43
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,880
I'll go check over there instead.

44
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,610
Alright, alright.

45
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,470
Thanks, Madam.

46
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,820
Su, you're back.

47
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,140
Just came back for a visit.

48
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,200
Alright, alright.

49
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,440
How much is this?

50
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,720
This one is 200 yuan.

51
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,840
For Su's sake,

52
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,040
I'll make it 180 yuan.

53
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,980
Make it 10 yuan cheaper.

54
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:05,070
You're such a tightwad!

55
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,610
I don't make much money.

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,760
Ruan Su.

57
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,480
I've heard about
what happened before from grandma.

58
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,340
Don't worry.

59
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,310
I won't leave you alone again.

60
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:41,610
You should

61
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,770
save those words for your girlfriend.

62
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,480
Girlfriend?

63
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,910
Where would I get a girlfriend?

64
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:50,530
You mean Ziyin?

65
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,440
Who else?

66
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,340
I only think of her as

67
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:55,570
a younger sister,

68
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,750
nothing more.

69
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:00,110
Then,

70
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,390
what about that photo?

71
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,550
What photo?

72
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:04,580
Forget it.

73
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:05,510
It's nothing.

74
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,420
It was my mistake.

75
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,190
The way I treated Ziyin before

76
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:12,120
must have given you the wrong idea.

77
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,400
But don't worry.

78
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:15,790
I'll clear things up with her.

79
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,630
Also,

80
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:19,110
I need to go back tomorrow.

81
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:20,589
There are some things
I need to take care of.

82
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:21,970
Once everything is settled,

83
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,230
I'll come back to pick you and grandma up.

84
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,360
I know it's you

85
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,180
who's been helping me
with the Ruan Xinhua thing.

86
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:29,940
Thank you.

87
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:34,240
Didn't we agree before?

88
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,350
No need for thanks.

89
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:55,920
Grandma, try this.

90
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,650
Here, Grandma, eat this.

91
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:58,390
Here.

92
00:04:58,409 --> 00:04:59,210
You eat too.

93
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:09,820
Stop!

94
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,480
Stop!

95
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:15,370
Stop!

96
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,240
Come back!

97
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,190
Stop!

98
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:25,340
Don't run!

99
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:36,470
Mr. Su, please spare me!

100
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,370
Mr. Su, I'll do anything

101
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,600
you say.

102
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,480
I can help you pay off the debt,

103
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,360
as long as you turn yourself in

104
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,120
and tell the truth about

105
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,190
what happened back then.

106
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,980
Then I'll clean up your mess.

107
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:56,280
I didn't do it.

108
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,600
I made a driving mistake
that caused my wife's fatal injury.

109
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,810
I-I even did a livestream
to extort my daughter.

110
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:02,860
This...

111
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:03,970
They gave it to you?

112
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,070
I've already given you a chance.

113
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,920
Whether you accept it or not,

114
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,260
that's up to you.

115
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:19,810
Whatever threats you faced afterward,

116
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,340
whether you live or die,

117
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:22,900
I won't help you.

118
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,770
No, no, no!

119
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,370
I promise!

120
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:26,000
I promise!

121
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:27,690
I really promise!

122
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:33,550
Let's go.

123
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,650
Alright, that's enough for now.

124
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:43,460
You all go prepare.

125
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,050
Su.

126
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,810
Ruan Xinhua turned himself in just now.

127
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,700
The police said they'll
reopen the investigation.

128
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:58,790
Your classmate has also been arrested.

129
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,330
She extorted 50 million from Ruan Xinhua.

130
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:05,140
I can't believe she
did something like this.

131
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,600
She must've lost her mind.

132
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:09,650
Xingzhi.

133
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:12,520
I thought you were mad at me,

134
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,060
and wouldn't come see me.

135
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:16,300
The reason I came today

136
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:17,950
is to tell you something.

137
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,750
Let's talk about it next time.

138
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,200
We haven't seen each other in so long.

139
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,090
I heard there's an art exhibition nearby...

140
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:26,810
Ziyin.

141
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:28,590
For all these years,

142
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:31,440
I've only felt gratitude towards you,

143
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,920
nothing else.

144
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,900
Xingzhi.

145
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,670
Weren't you the one who said

146
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,820
you'd always protect me?

147
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:44,640
But we've both grown up.

148
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,520
My gratitude for you

149
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,120
has never changed.

150
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,960
We both have our own lives now.

151
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,540
Xingzhi, you know.

152
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:54,680
I've already fallen out with my family
because of what happened last time.

153
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,310
If you leave me now,

154
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,310
I'll have nothing.

155
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,600
It must be Ruan Su
who forced you to leave me.

156
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,450
I'm going to find her right now.

157
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,270
Don't you dare.

158
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,780
As long as I'm here,

159
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,640
no one can touch her.

160
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,020
You've crossed my boundaries
time and time again.

161
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,150
Do you think I won't do anything to you?

162
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:23,940
Cheng Ziyin.

163
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,140
I don't want us to

164
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,240
end up like this.

165
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,390
I paid the check.

166
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:30,190
Take your time eating.

167
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:33,750
Trying to get rid of me?

168
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:35,270
Not so easy.

169
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,179
I'll make you realize

170
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:39,690
that I am your only choice.
