1
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:46,880
Mr. Bo.

2
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:49,840
Mr. Bo.

3
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,840
The team we sent to investigate Longhu Mountain

4
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,700
hasn't checked in all afternoon.

5
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,350
What's going on?

6
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:57,390
Why are you only reporting this now?

7
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,200
You had an important meeting just now.

8
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,860
We didn't dare to disturb you.

9
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:01,640
Besides,

10
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,200
I heard that Hengjiu Technology

11
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,430
also sent someone over.

12
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:05,480
They haven't checked in either.

13
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,790
Track their phone locations immediately.

14
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:08,320
Yes, sir.

15
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:10,280
Are you okay?

16
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,200
Here, are you alright?

17
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,350
My leg - I can't move it.

18
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:17,480
I think it's broken.

19
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:19,000
Don't move.

20
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,039
Don't move. Relax.

21
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:30,840
I don't think we'll be able to make it down the mountain today.

22
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,560
Don't worry.

23
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,490
Bo Group will definitely send someone to rescue you.

24
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,590
You're still defending them?

25
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:39,490
Those higher-ups only care about on making money

26
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,289
and maximizing their profits.

27
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:43,430
They don't give a damn about

28
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:44,360
us at the bottom.

29
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,950
There's a breaking news alert.

30
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,640
A once-in-50-years torrential downpour is expected soon.

31
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,560
Citizens are advised to stay indoors and be on flood alert.

32
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,160
What did the rescue team say?

33
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,680
They're already on their way.

34
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,710
But it's going to rain soon.

35
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,370
It'll make the rescue harder.

36
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,870
How exactly do you do things?

37
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:06,510
Ruan Su was following your team for the investigation.

38
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,430
Ruan Su was following your team for the investigation.

39
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:09,030
Now she's completely uncontactable.

40
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:09,520
Ruan Su?

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Why was she there?

42
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,000
Drive.

43
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:16,800
Ms. Ruan!

44
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,800
Can you hear me, Ms. Ruan?

45
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,750
Ruan Su!

46
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:23,280
Ms. Ruan!

47
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,680
I'm here!

48
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,079
Ms. Ruan!

49
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,430
Wait there, I'll rescue you!

50
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,910
They're coming to get us any moment now.

51
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,520
Be careful.

52
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,250
Take it slow.

53
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,829
I'm glad you're fine.

54
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,120
Bo Xingzhi.

55
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,680
Are you showing me tenderness out of pity?

56
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:34,870
I heard

57
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,730
you got a perfect score this time?

58
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,200
So what if you got a scholarship?

59
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,840
You want to show off again?

60
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,100
None of your business.

61
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,710
Did I say you could leave?

62
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,000
Let go of me!

63
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,130
Let go of you, right?

64
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:50,960
Fine.

65
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:56,680
Help!

66
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,800
Didn't they say you're good at everything?

67
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,190
So you can't swim?

68
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:01,430
Help!

69
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,400
Swim!

70
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,150
Help!

71
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,240
You're awake.

72
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,480
You saved me.

73
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,680
Thank you.

74
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,070
What's your name?

75
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,600
Bo Xingzhi

76
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,870
But this time,

77
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,720
I won't go back.

78
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:47,920
You never mentioned

79
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,180
you're at Hengjiu.

80
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:50,560
Why?

81
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,750
I can't get a new job?

82
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,990
Why didn't you say you were hurt?

83
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,040
I'm not that delicate.

84
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,360
Ziyin, your coffee.

85
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,270
Get lost!

86
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,600
Ziyin, what happened?

87
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,630
I said get lost!

88
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:26,920
Okay.

89
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,240
Ruan Su.

90
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,040
Don't even think about stealing Xingzhi

91
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,390
away from me.

92
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,120
Mr. Bo.

93
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,390
The boss of Hengjiu Tech Group still hasn't arrived.

94
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,390
Should we rethink

95
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,870
this partnership?

96
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,750
Let me introduce.

97
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,430
This is the founder of our company, Ruan Su.

98
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,600
Hello, everyone.

99
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:11,190
Mr. Bo, long time no see.

100
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,270
It's you.

101
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,870
Mr. Bo, you look surprised.

102
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:20,800
Indeed.

103
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,310
Today we're going to discuss

104
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:31,770
the proposal for the Photovoltaic Power Generation project.

105
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,320
Please pay special attention to this section.

106
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:41,600
Mr. Bo,

107
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:42,830
your eyes

108
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:44,600
are practically glued to Ms. Ruan.

109
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,630
Better rein it in.

110
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,460
Otherwise, it'll affect our professionalism.

111
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,070
Xingzhi.

112
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,270
Su

113
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,560
hasn't been back with you for a long time.

114
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,830
Has she been busy lately?

115
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,680
Probably.

116
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,630
What do you mean probably?

117
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,000
She is your wife.

118
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,040
You should care more about her.

119
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,870
Not to lecture you,

120
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,160
but if you keep treating her like this,

121
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,120
sooner or later,

122
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:17,280
she'll be pissed off and leave you one day.

123
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,000
You never should've forced us together

124
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,270
four years ago.

125
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,040
If we'd had the chance to actually get to know each other,

126
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,600
we wouldn't be torturing each other.

127
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,200
You think the past four years

128
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:27,750
were just Grandpa forcing you two together?

129
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,800
Am I wrong?

130
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,830
Look at you.

131
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,640
What is it this time?

132
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,010
Come to the old house for dinner tonight.

133
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,190
Bo Xingzhi.

134
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,720
What's our relationship now?

135
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,600
Please know your place.

136
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,560
Don't bother me.

137
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,240
You're overthinking.

138
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,920
Grandpa is not feeling well recently.

139
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,320
He wants you to visit him.

140
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,680
Don't forget, we haven't got the divorce certificate.

141
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,950
You're still his granddaughter-in-law.

142
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,430
Don't worry. Grandpa's always treated me kindly.

143
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,040
Make sure to tell him

144
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,190
I'll come.

145
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,940
At the meeting that day...

146
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,240
Your place is pretty big.

147
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,980
Xingzhi's really generous with you.

148
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,000
I didn't expect you

149
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,870
to be the first one to show up.

150
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,240
Yeah, it's a big place.

151
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,390
But when you become Mrs. Bo,

152
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,600
this kind of house

153
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,080
might not even impress you anymore.

154
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,840
Looking at you now,

155
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,080
it seems like

156
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,039
you haven't figured out a way

157
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,390
to get into his bed, huh?

158
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,030
You...

159
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,340
You just happened to win Grandpa's favor

160
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,640
and forced Xingzhi to marry you.

161
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,930
I'm warning you.

162
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,080
Stay away from him.

163
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,410
Otherwise, don't blame me for being rude.

164
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,000
What a show.

165
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,670
I wonder what Bo Xingzhi would think

166
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,550
if he saw you

167
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,240
like this now?

168
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,440
Are you jealous?
