1
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:41,280
(Beautiful)

2
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:43,290
(Episode 10)

3
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:49,880
Su.

4
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:53,000
Cheng Ziyin’s business cooperation

5
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,300
has been completely terminated.

6
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,160
Her company has officially requested
to terminate the contract with her.

7
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,080
I see.

8
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:03,860
We just revealed the truth

9
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:05,850
but didn’t expect it to spread so quickly.

10
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,720
It seems she’s been too arrogant,

11
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,340
and offended a lot of people.

12
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,960
Those who do wrong will
eventually pay the price.

13
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,420
She got what she deserved.

14
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:16,330
Her career is now completely ruined.

15
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,480
Let’s see if she dares to do anything

16
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:20,420
so morally bankrupt again.

17
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:23,670
After this kind of people fall,

18
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,100
they often can’t accept it

19
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,500
and become more reckless,
trying to turn the tide.

20
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,600
But Cheng Ziyin

21
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,510
wasn’t even part of my plan.

22
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,759
However, if she dares to do anything

23
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,560
that breaks my bottom line again,

24
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,200
I won’t let her off.

25
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:39,080
I’ve got a dinner meeting,
I’ll head out now.

26
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,080
Okay.

27
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,039
Xingzhi.

28
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,080
Do you think I’m really dumb?

29
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:56,500
I fell for such an obvious scam.

30
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,800
I need to be more careful next time.

31
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,330
I can’t be so naive anymore.

32
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,430
Can you help me get through this?

33
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,600
Please, Xingzhi.

34
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,450
Please help me this time.

35
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:18,560
I'm a little tired these days.
I didn't rest well.

36
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:19,970
I’m going to rest now.

37
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,500
You should sleep early too.

38
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,320
Good night.

39
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,290
Xingzhi.

40
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,530
Li Meixing.

41
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,550
Are you and Ruan Su in this together?

42
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,840
Check the online comments.

43
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,710
They’re all praising her
and criticizing me.

44
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,960
You two teamed up to destroy me.

45
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,070
Really went to great lengths.

46
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:51,480
You still don’t understand.

47
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,070
This was all set up by Ruan Su.

48
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,720
I was kind-hearted and helped you.

49
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,579
And you still accuse me of
being in cahoots with her.

50
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,690
Forget it.

51
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:04,430
Now we can’t let her keep getting ahead.

52
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,720
You better find her weakness quickly.

53
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,050
Young people like Ruan Su,

54
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,400
who has business acumen and is smart

55
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,040
and steady,

56
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,080
are rare nowadays.

57
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,940
Mr. Liu.

58
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,440
Sorry.

59
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,820
I’m late.

60
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,740
Who is this?

61
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,079
This is Mr. Shang,

62
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:24,810
He’s in the antiques business.

63
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,320
Mr. Shang, nice to meet you.

64
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,040
Nice to meet you.

65
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,780
My family do antique business too.

66
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,579
Not sure if you’ve heard of us.

67
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,430
You are…

68
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:35,460
the daughter of Ruan Xinhua from Ruan Group.

69
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,640
Ms. Ruan.

70
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,980
It's a deal then.

71
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,910
I’ve got something to do,
so I’ll leave first.

72
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,350
Alright, no problem.

73
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:49,370
Okay.

74
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,760
I got the photo. It's good.

75
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,420
Send them to the press immediately.

76
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,530
By tomorrow morning,

77
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,090
I want to see this news out.

78
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,520
Xingzhi.

79
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:23,440
Look at this.

80
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,440
The person in this photo

81
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,700
looks so familiar.

82
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,070
Isn’t this Ruan Su?

83
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:32,150
How could she do something like this?

84
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,920
I always thought it was just rumors.

85
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,280
Didn’t expect her to
find a rich guy.

86
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:41,560
Isn’t that the president of the auction company,

87
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,800
Shang Lingxiao?

88
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:45,640
I heard their family is extremely wealthy.

89
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,830
Ruan Su

90
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,520
really knows how to pick a man.

91
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:52,100
Xingzhi.

92
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,400
Now you see

93
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,800
her true face.

94
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,080
She’s just a shallow

95
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,600
and vain woman.

96
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,840
Ruan Su never

97
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,880
takes shortcuts

98
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,250
and uses men to achieve her goals.

99
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,210
Don't read such rumors online

100
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,740
and stop spreading them too.

101
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:08,850
Maybe she doesn't care,

102
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:09,890
but it will hurt

103
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,060
her family.

104
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,720
I'm leaving.

105
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,260
Ruan Su.

106
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,650
I know your weakness now.

107
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,320
Red Zhong.

108
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,240
Waiting for my good news.

109
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,070
I win.

110
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,840
Wait. What is that?

111
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,320
You win?

112
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,360
Look at mine.

113
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,480
Big brother.

114
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,560
You're not lucky today.

115
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,640
Do you play or not?

116
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,600
No.

117
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,880
Don't be a coward.

118
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,880
Play one more round.

119
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,800
Who's a coward?

120
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:43,270
I have plenty of money.

121
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,490
Let’s keep playing.

122
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,040
Still playing mahjong?

123
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,240
You said you'd buy me a bag.

124
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,080
Okay, I got it.

125
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,159
I'll take you to buy it when I win.

126
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:52,960
Be good.

127
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,360
You always say that.

128
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,409
In the end, you lose all your money.

129
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,320
When will you

130
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,720
keep your promises?

131
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,430
Can you stop annoying me?

132
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,160
Can’t even play mahjong in peace.

133
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,560
Looking for a fight, huh?

134
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,700
Let’s break up!

135
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,910
Who cares?

136
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,790
Get lost!

137
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,610
So annoying.

138
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,740
Just get lost!

139
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,400
Grandma, I’m back.

140
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,400
Grandma.

141
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:25,250
Didn’t we agree you’d wait for me at home?

142
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,800
Grandma.

143
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:43,640
Sorry!

144
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,590
The subscriber you dialed
can not be connected for the moment...

145
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:47,670
Strange.

146
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,159
Didn’t we agree to

147
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,820
have dinner together at home?

148
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:53,840
Your grandma’s in my hands.

149
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,280
If you want to find her, come here.

150
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,600
You must be safe.

151
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,600
Hey, baby.

152
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,100
Don't be angry.

153
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,110
I was wrong today.

154
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,610
Didn’t you want that bag?

155
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,520
Wait for me.

156
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,970
I’ll go find

157
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,660
that woman.

158
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,320
I’ll go get the money

159
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,730
from her.

160
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,360
I’ll definitely buy you the bag tomorrow.

161
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:22,960
Okay?

162
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,970
Old woman, behave yourself.

163
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,400
Your granddaughter’s life

164
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,320
is in my hands right now.

165
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,680
Honey.

166
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,040
Mom.

167
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,070
What are you doing here?

168
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,890
She missed us.

169
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,440
She wanted to stay here for a while.

170
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,360
Right, mom?

171
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,830
Yeah.

172
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,600
I missed you guys.

173
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,040
So I asked Meixing to pick me up.

174
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,720
Okay.

175
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,210
Honey.

176
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:00,110
Why are you suddenly back?

177
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:03,900
I’ve been hosting some bosses these days.

178
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,760
I’m short on money. Transfer some to me.

179
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,920
I knew you were out of money.

180
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,450
I'll transfer it to you now.

181
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:14,070
I transferred 200,000 dollars.

182
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,460
It's so easy this time.

183
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,390
Alright, thanks, babe.

184
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,720
Hold on.

185
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,090
There’s a condition for the money.

186
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,230
These days,

187
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,050
don’t interfere in the thing
between your mom and me.

188
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:27,330
What are you up to now?

189
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,430
That’s my mom.

190
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,650
What do you mean?

191
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,440
Am I going to eat her or something?

192
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,280
Don’t worry.

193
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,039
I’ll take good care of our mom.

194
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,500
Alright, I promise you.

195
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:36,990
I have another dinner to attend.

196
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:37,870
I have to go.

197
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,400
When you have time,
go to the hospital to see our son.

198
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,419
Got it.
