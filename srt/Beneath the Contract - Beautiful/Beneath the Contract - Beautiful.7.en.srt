1
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,200
Don't worry.

2
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,240
No matter what I become,

3
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,080
my Xingzhi

4
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,600
will only like me.

5
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,260
Did you see it clearly?

6
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,000
We are very close.

7
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,120
Not just anyone can come between us.

8
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,200
Are you done?

9
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,000
If you are, you can leave now.

10
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,680
Liu,

11
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:28,970
which one of them

12
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,280
do you think is Ruan Su?

13
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,120
Isn't it obvious?

14
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,720
It's the one on the left.

15
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,120
She looks full of herself.

16
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,120
No, no.

17
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:39,759
I feel like...

18
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,800
it's the one on the right.

19
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,720
Are you blind or something?

20
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,600
I can't believe that old lady.

21
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,840
She just gave us a photo of someone's back.

22
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,880
What are we supposed to see from that?

23
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,440
Whatever. Let's just kidnap them both.

24
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,080
Let's go.

25
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,280
I'm not the slightest bit interested

26
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,960
in your Xingzhi.

27
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:58,960
But you—

28
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,040
if you look down on me so much,

29
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,920
why did you fall in love with the man I abandoned?

30
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,850
What do you mean?

31
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,800
This is my own house.

32
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,720
Get out of here right now.

33
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,200
And don't forget to tell Bo Xingzhi

34
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,800
to sign the divorce papers as soon as possible,

35
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,400
so that his little sweetheart

36
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,680
won't go crazy again.

37
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,579
Who are you calling crazy?

38
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,040
She's not home?

39
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,570
We agreed to have dinner together. Why can't I reach her?

40
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,160
Sorry,

41
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,600
the number you dialed is currently unavailable.

42
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,320
A message

43
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,400
will be sent to notify the recipient.

44
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,320
Goodbye.

45
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,840
Who are you?

46
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,360
Why did you kidnap me?

47
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,880
Shut up,

48
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,720
or I'll kill you.

49
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,920
Tell us.

50
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:53,240
Which one of you...

51
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,060
What's her name again?

52
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,600
Ruan.

53
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,880
Which one of you is Ruan Su?

54
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,080
It's...

55
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,720
It's her.

56
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,280
She is Ruan Su.

57
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,120
I told you.

58
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,080
You got the wrong person.

59
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,680
Why did you kidnap me?

60
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,600
Hey.

61
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,640
Don't make them angry,

62
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,720
or I'll make sure you die with me.

63
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,520
Shut up!

64
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,840
If it weren't for you,

65
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,700
how would they have kidnapped me?

66
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,760
I'm telling you,

67
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,079
let me go immediately.

68
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,480
If you don't,

69
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,440
Cheng's Group won't let you off.

70
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,760
Then we definitely can't let you go.

71
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,440
Keep talking, and I'll kill you.

72
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,560
I'd like to see

73
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,890
who exactly wants to kidnap me.

74
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,120
Now,

75
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,040
based on the location sent from the chip,

76
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,240
we've got complete information on Madam.

77
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,480
Don't act rashly. Wait a bit longer.

78
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:51,040
Su might be trying to lure them out.

79
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,120
Okay.

80
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,400
Let's go.

81
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,640
I just hacked into Hengjiu Technology's internal network.

82
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,840
We've basically pinpointed your friend's location.

83
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,600
Mr. Bo,

84
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,760
this is the suspect vehicle

85
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,560
that was last seen on surveillance.

86
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,080
But I remember this road is a dead end.

87
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,240
It ends at an abandoned factory that's been deserted for decades.

88
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,079
I see.

89
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,770
The one who ordered you to kidnap me is Li Meixing, right?

90
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,280
Make them shut up.

91
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,080
Stop!

92
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,560
Don't move.

93
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,880
Stop right there.

94
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:50,760
Xingzhi?

95
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,159
save me, Xingzhi!

96
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:52,960
Stop yelling.

97
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,400
Only one can be released. Let him choose.

98
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,200
Okay.

99
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,000
Tell me.

100
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,370
What do you want?

101
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,480
Our boss just said

102
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,800
we can let them go,

103
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,640
but

104
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,480
there's a condition—

105
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,880
you can only

106
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,520
take one of them.

107
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,880
Xingzhi, save me!

108
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,360
Save me, Xingzhi!

109
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,480
Mr. Bo,

110
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,480
it's time to make a choice.

111
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,120
Otherwise, if I regret it,

112
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,840
neither of them will survive.

113
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,840
Xingzhi, save me!

114
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,960
Xingzhi.

115
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,000
What are you waiting for?

116
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm talking to you.

117
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,440
Have you made your choice?

118
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,200
I choose...

119
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,640
No matter when you need me,

120
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,480
I'll be there.

121
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,640
Wait a bit longer, Ruan Su.

122
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:47,620
I'll come to save you soon.

123
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,880
I choose her.

124
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,480
I knew it.

125
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,280
I'm the one who got abandoned again.

126
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,560
Please spare me, Master!

127
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,200
Master, I won't dare to do it again!

128
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,160
Master.

129
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,000
Where is Li Meixing?

130
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,360
Master, please spare me. I'll tell you!

131
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,440
Ruan Su!

132
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,400
Are you okay?

133
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,409
Don't pretend to care about me.

134
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,760
It makes me sick.

135
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,200
Madam.

136
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,370
Su, are you alright?

137
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,200
Bo Xingzhi,

138
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,080
I actually kept hoping for you again and again.

139
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,520
I overestimated my place in your heart.

140
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,320
It turns out everything you did

141
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,960
was just a business tactic.

142
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,680
I was wrong to trust you.

143
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,880
From now on, we're strangers

144
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,410
with nothing to do with each other.

145
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,720
Mr. Bo,

146
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,320
since you've

147
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,920
made your choice here today,

148
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,760
please be decisive like a man

149
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,600
and don't mess with Ruan Su anymore.

150
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,100
If there's a next time,

151
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,600
I won't let you off so easily.

152
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,800
You're here.

153
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,120
You never take a break.

154
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,410
It's my work, after all.

155
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,040
Take a break.

156
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,800
I finally convinced you to have a full check-up.

157
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,200
Think of it as a vacation.

158
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,360
I specially had a famous nutritionist prepare this soup—

159
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,290
it's delicious.

160
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,240
Chicken soup?

161
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:22,840
Here.

162
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,160
Smells great.

163
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,880
I'll do it myself.

164
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,880
Looks like my worries were unnecessary.

165
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,799
I thought you wouldn't feel like eating.

166
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,720
How could that be?

167
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,039
I have things to do.

168
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,120
Let the past be past.

169
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,159
What matters now is to eat well, drink well,

170
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,200
and recover.

171
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,560
That's the Ruan Su I know.
