1
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,180
(Beautiful)

2
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,130
(Episode 15)

3
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:07,480
Get Ruan Su down here. I need to talk to her.

4
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:09,789
I'm sorry, do you have an appointment?

5
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,000
If not,

6
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,160
I'll need to check with my supervisor.

7
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,610
No need to check. I'm her father.

8
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:16,850
I'm sorry, sir,

9
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,180
could you please tell me your name?

10
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,440
I need to register you.

11
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:22,570
I said, I am Ruan Su's father.

12
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,160
Are you deaf?

13
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:24,980
Looks like

14
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,520
I need to

15
00:01:26,539 --> 00:01:28,680
teach you a lesson on her behalf.

16
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,920
This is my company.

17
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,390
It's not your place to act so brazenly here.

18
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,880
Not bad, Su.

19
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:40,430
Very impressive.

20
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:43,240
Running such a big company.

21
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,050
You must be making quite a bit of money.

22
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:45,990
Do you need something?

23
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:47,830
Dad's a bit short on cash lately.

24
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:50,320
Thought I'd ask you for some spending money.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,470
So, you've come for money.

26
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,200
I really don't have a penny left on me.

27
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,210
I'm

28
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,710
at the end of my rope.

29
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,690
I was so good to you before.

30
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,070
Please help me out.

31
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:03,200
You were good to me before,

32
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,400
but have you forgotten

33
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,110
how you indulged that mother and son

34
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,270
in hurting me?

35
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,479
I just misjudged them, okay?

36
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,450
That woman totally screwed me over.

37
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,250
Ruan's Group went bankrupt too.

38
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,470
You should just let it go, okay?

39
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:17,290
That's your own doing.

40
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,020
It's none of my business.

41
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:20,990
If you're only here for money,

42
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:22,610
then sorry, I don't have any.

43
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,280
It's only right...

44
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,630
for a daughter to give her dad money.

45
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,250
I raised you all these years.

46
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:36,000
And now you're not even willing to
give me some money?

47
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,540
Nice words.

48
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,160
Throughout my life, only my mom
ever raised me!

49
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,270
Everyone, come over and see this!

50
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,750
Come over here! Your company's boss,

51
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,760
Ruan Su,

52
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:49,500
not only caused her brother to be paralyzed,

53
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,310
but now

54
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,700
she's also pushing her own birth father

55
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,079
to the edge!

56
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:57,079
She thought marrying into the Bo family

57
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:00,160
made her some high-class lady!

58
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,380
But look where that got her.

59
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,520
They were just playing with her.

60
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:05,580
You,

61
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,760
you're nothing but a low-class plaything—

62
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,560
never meant to be seen in public!

63
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:12,110
What nonsense are you talking about?

64
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,560
What are you doing?

65
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,130
-Let go of me!
-Move!

66
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:17,510
You wicked girl, this is not over!

67
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:19,230
Let go of me! Let go!

68
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,560
They're hitting me!

69
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,280
Let go!

70
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,400
Dear netizens,

71
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:29,370
I am a desperate old father.

72
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:31,030
I'm here to denounce

73
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,770
Ruan Su, the chairwoman of Hengjiu Tech.

74
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,340
Isn't that the woman in this post?

75
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:37,100
Let me check.

76
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:38,970
That's her.

77
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,290
How can a daughter be so heartless?

78
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,270
She lives in a luxury villa herself,

79
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:42,550
(Photos of Ruan Su entertaining men, and accusations
that she abused her father)

83
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,260
I'll handle this immediately.

84
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,390
Xinyu.

85
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:53,880
Let him act out all he wants.
Don't bother with him.

86
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,560
Have you seen the posts?

87
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,640
I didn't expect the public to be

88
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,860
so interested in your private life.

89
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:04,800
I guess it won't be long

90
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,140
before they find out your phone number.

91
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,940
Let me give you a piece of advice.

92
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:10,840
Don't let a little money

93
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:13,170
damage our relationship.

94
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:15,310
If I'm not going to have it easy,

95
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,860
then neither are you.

96
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,019
What's wrong?

97
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,580
You wicked girl!

98
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:32,520
Open the door and come down here right now!

99
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,190
I know you're in there!

100
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:45,290
I'm telling you,

101
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,690
I won't leave today!

102
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,460
Hey.

103
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,140
Looks like I've come to the right place.

104
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:06,600
Who sent you?

105
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,160
My own flesh and blood

106
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,110
doesn't care whether I live or die.

107
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,800
Why should you care?

108
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,060
You want money, right?

109
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,250
Fine.

110
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,360
There is one condition.

111
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:37,930
(Ruan Su)

112
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:41,070
(Sorry, no related information found.
Please try different keywords.)

113
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,380
Why have all those posts disappeared?

114
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:48,290
Su, I've found your dad's place.

115
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,430
He's staying at the Ruyi Motel.

116
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,340
So, it's him again.

117
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,240
Mr. Bo,

118
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:11,880
look.

119
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,730
I've deleted all the posts too.

120
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,740
When will the money

121
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,250
be transferred to my account?

122
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,270
As long as you promise not to
harass Ruan Su again,

123
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,450
the money will be in your account soon.

124
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:20,750
No more harassment, I swear.

125
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,990
I'm always a man of my word.

126
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,600
Just wait, the money will arrive soon.

127
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,190
Mr. Bo, you're such a generous man.

128
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,450
Unlike some people...

129
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,110
that wretched child...

130
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:35,630
Look at my big mouth.

131
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:37,740
If I may ask,

132
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,480
what's your relationship...

133
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,240
with my daughter now?

134
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,159
My relationship with her

135
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:43,560
is none of your business.

136
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:46,700
Also, be careful with your words
and actions in the future.

137
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,430
If such mistakes happen again,

138
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,300
I won't be as nice as I am now.

139
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,710
Yes, yes, yes.

140
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,200
Hello?

141
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:03,970
I've already transferred the money to you.

142
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,490
After all,

143
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,720
I was once the chairman of Ruan's Group.

144
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,600
I can certainly afford this amount.

145
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,940
Now that you've got the money,

146
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,870
then shut your mouth permanently!

147
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,890
And never contact me again!

148
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,740
These past few days have really worn me out.

149
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,570
I need to find a place to relax.

150
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:33,730
Round.

151
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:34,860
Round.

152
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:35,909
Round!

153
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,100
Fulu got the winning hand.

154
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,570
My luck's been bad lately.

155
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,580
Put it on my tab.

156
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:44,280
Well...

157
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,200
give me another 200,000 yuan.

158
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,950
I'll definitely pay you back if I win.

159
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,610
Boss, he wants another 200,000 yuan.

160
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:49,890
Should we give it to him?

161
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:51,370
Alright, no problem.

162
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,600
Let's go.

163
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:56,030
Okay.

164
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,160
Mr. Su.

165
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,240
Where's the money?

166
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,110
Money... I don't have it now.

167
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,470
Give me...

168
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:08,650
give me two days.

169
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,380
I'll definitely pay you back in two days.

170
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,690
Your promise

171
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,040
is worth shit.

172
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:14,740
Unless

173
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:16,280
I've got

174
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,520
some dirt on you.

175
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,160
I heard someone was responsible
for his wife's death.

176
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,080
No, no,

177
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,130
a-absolutely not.

178
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:26,190
If you don't tell me,

179
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:28,950
I'll send you to join her tomorrow.

180
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:29,860
How about that?

181
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:35,690
I... I... I'll talk.

182
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,820
It was my driving mistake that caused
my wife's fatal injury.

183
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,179
I... I...

184
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,770
I... I... I also did a livestream

185
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:44,230
to blackmail my daughter.

186
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,800
Mr. Su, please spare me.

187
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:49,460
I'll give you two more days.

188
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,250
If you can't come up with the money by then...

00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:58,070
your family should start preparing
for your funeral.
