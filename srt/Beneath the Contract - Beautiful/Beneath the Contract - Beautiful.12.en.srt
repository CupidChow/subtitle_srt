00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:47,720
You're watching the news too?

00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,850
Looks like Bo Xingzhi helped you out.

11
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:55,950
Mr. Shang.

12
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,990
Sorry, I got stuck in traffic.

13
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,440
Hello, Mr. Shang.

14
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,660
Ms. Ruan, long time no see.

15
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:05,820
Have a seat.

16
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:06,790
You too.

17
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:11,500
Then I'll

18
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,380
get straight to the point.

19
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:14,900
Ms. Ruan,

20
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,170
what is it you wanted to give me?

21
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,590
Mr. Shang.

22
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:30,289
Previously, Li Meixing, your business partner,

23
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:32,800
kept the commission from the deal with the client for herself

24
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,000
without telling you.

25
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:35,560
After that, she repeatedly

26
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,960
stole your clients.

27
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:41,000
Mr. Shang, you really didn't know about this?

28
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,890
Ms. Ruan, what do you

29
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,890
want me to do with this?

30
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:49,500
Nothing.

31
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,539
I've given you the information.

32
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:52,620
What you do with it

33
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,610
is entirely up to you.

34
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:56,630
If you want to sue her,

35
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,860
this evidence

36
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,410
is more than enough.

37
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,070
I told you before,

38
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:10,030
be careful when transporting the materials!

39
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,840
No one can find out about this!

40
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,560
It all fell on deaf ears, didn't it?

41
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,760
Ms. Li, we were already really careful.

42
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,400
But with so much material piled up at the site,

43
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,310
it's impossible not to draw attention.

44
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,190
What did you say?

45
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,120
Sorry, Ms. Li!

46
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,329
It's all our fault.

47
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,960
At least the reason behind Bo Group's withdrawal

48
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,560
hasn't been leaked yet.

49
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,540
From now on,

50
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,600
no matter what happens,

51
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,470
keep those workers quiet.

52
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:31,240
Understood?

53
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,120
Yes, Ms. Li.

54
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,030
Come in.

55
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,110
Hello, Mr. Shang.

56
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,120
We meet again.

57
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:40,590
Have a seat.

58
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,840
How much product this time?

59
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,720
It's a big order.

60
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,000
You're gonna love it.

61
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,420
The antique business is too risky.

62
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,880
Our company doesn’t deal

63
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,410
with goods under five million.

64
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:56,670
What are you thinking?

65
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:58,810
It’s one billion.

66
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,560
You're not kidding?

67
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,750
Please.

68
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:04,160
Just tell me,

69
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,750
are you in or not?

70
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,120
I heard about

71
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,120
your company's situation.

72
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,180
You probably really need this money.

73
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:12,770
Who asked for so much?

74
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,120
A friend of mine.

75
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,690
He does business overseas.

76
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,030
Forget it.

77
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,530
You let this big fish

78
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,400
slip through your fingers.

79
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,550
Don't say I didn't give you a chance.

80
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,630
Wait.

81
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,680
I can do it.

82
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,570
But as you know,

83
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:34,650
to find enough goods

84
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,100
that are suitable for export,

85
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,910
it'll take some time.

86
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,160
I know.

87
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,960
Then when are we signing the contract?

88
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,790
They are still drafting the contract.

89
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,840
Prepare the goods as soon as possible.

90
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,250
I'm a little worried.

91
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,460
How about we wait until the contract's signed?

92
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,390
What do you mean?

93
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,880
Don't you trust me?

94
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,120
When have I ever missed a payment?

95
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,180
But if you

96
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,310
miss the shipment deadline, don't blame me.

00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,269
Grandma,

104
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:17,190
this is the soup

105
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,190
you always used to bring me to drink.

106
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,430
Boss.

107
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,140
Two bowls of lamb soup, please.

108
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,540
Okay. Please have a seat.

109
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,460
You're early today.

110
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,560
Don't even start.

111
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,400
I just got off work.

112
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:30,710
What kind of job has you working overnight?

113
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,440
Moving goods for Ruan's Group.

114
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,630
Every single day...

115
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:34,830
I'm exhausted.

116
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:35,510
Alright, alright.

117
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,000
Just a minute.

118
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,840
Hold on.

119
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:37,680
Okay.

120
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:39,320
Two bowls of lamb soup!

121
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,440
Brother.

122
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,050
Where are you guys moving the goods?

123
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:45,300
The work's tough.

124
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,580
You're a woman. You can't stand it.

125
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,540
No, I have a younger brother.

126
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,710
He doesn't do much all day,

127
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,390
so I thought I'd find something for him.

128
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:54,750
They screen us very strictly.

129
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,830
And you have to sign a confidentiality agreement.

130
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,800
If your brother wants to do it,

131
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,440
once he gets through the process,

132
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,070
the job'll be over.

133
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,490
I see. Thanks.

134
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:06,460
No problem.

135
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:09,570
Eat up, Su.

136
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,140
You go ahead, Grandma.

00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:11,760

165
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,240
They want to add another 2000 pieces.

No problem.

167
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,080

before our Ruan's Group

169
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,190
can stand on equal footing with the Bo's Group.

170
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:15,630
Hello, Xinyu.

171
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,240
I found out something about Ruan's Group.

172
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,040
They've stockpiled thousands of antiques in a warehouse,

173
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,780
getting ready to ship them overseas.

174
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,440
Looks like Shang Lingxiao didn't do what I said.

175
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:27,030
He's still trying to help Ruan's Group.

176
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,520
But now that they've slipped up,

177
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:33,790
they can't blame me for being ruthless.

178
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,159
Hello, Ms. Li.

179
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,800

I'll be right there.

186
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,950
What should we do, Ms. Li?

187
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,630
Mr. Shang can’t be reached.

188
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,140
Should we call the police?

189
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,530
No.

190
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,880
Do you want us all to get arrested?

191
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,700
You may leave.

192
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:22,630
Hello, Mr. Li.

193
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,540
Can you lend me some money?

194
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,710
As soon as the company is back on track,

195
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:27,800
I will...

196
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,200
Auntie.

197
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:45,890
Auntie, how have you been?

198
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,900
I know what you're calling about.

199
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,710
Thanks to you, even my company has been affected.

200
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,310
Don't ever contact us again.

201
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:52,850
Li Meixing!

202
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,830
What have you done

203
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,220
to my company?

204
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,050
Even my house is being seized!

205
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,050
I made a business deal

206
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,200
and got scammed.

207
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,410
Scammed?

208
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,210
You damn loser!

209
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,150
The company I worked so hard to build

210
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:09,040
has been ruined by you just like that?

211
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,480
How dare you blame me?

212
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,390
You laze around doing nothing every day.

213
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,390
Have you ever cared about the company?

214
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:16,000
What do you mean by your company?

215
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,880
The company wasn't under the Ruan name before!

216
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,710
You...

217
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,920
You crazy woman!

218
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:22,070
I won't argue

219
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,480
with you today.

220
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,150
If the company situation isn't resolved,

221
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,390
I won't let you off!

222
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:34,890
Just now,

223
