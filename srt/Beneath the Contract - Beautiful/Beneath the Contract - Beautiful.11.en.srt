1
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,050
(Beautiful)

2
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:43,100
(Episode 11)

3
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,840
Li Meixing didn't lie to me.

4
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,100
Since you're so eager to come to me,

5
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,410
don't even think about running away.

6
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,850
That's exactly how the project

7
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:56,180
with Mr. Wang stands.

8
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:57,720
But I think there are still some loopholes

9
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,350
in this project,

10
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,820
like the acquisition part.

11
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:03,200
I think

12
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:03,540
we can reconsider that a bit more.

13
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,349
(Info now) (West Coast Hotel)
we can reconsider that a bit more.

14
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:05,660
(Mr. Bo, we've located Ms. Ruan in room 302 at the West Coast Hotel. She's in danger.)

15
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:06,230
Mr. Bo,
(Mr. Bo, we've located Ms. Ruan in room 302 at the West Coast Hotel. She's in danger.)

16
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:07,100
where are you going?

17
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,030
To save someone!

18
00:01:18,539 --> 00:01:21,210
If you had just obeyed me back then,

19
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,200
none of this trouble would've happened.

20
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,750
Let her go!

21
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:29,310
Why?

22
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:33,539
She's mine now.

23
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,190
Mind your own business.

24
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,229
I didn't expect Mr. Wan, such a big shot,

25
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:41,580
to do something so dirty.

26
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,420
She owed me.

27
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,470
She came to beg me

28
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:48,000
to cooperate with you.

29
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,920
Why didn't I ask for anything?

30
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:52,960
I regret it now.

31
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:55,160
What do you mean? Tell me.

32
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,630
It seems that you

33
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,400
know nothing.

34
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,900
Do you remember

35
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:03,590
the meeting three years ago?

36
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,290
You really embarrassed me.

37
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,900
If she hadn't come begging me

38
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:11,080
to cover for your arrogance,

39
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,460
how could you have passed the Old Mr. Bo's

40
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,590
strict tests

41
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,500
to inherit?

42
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,220
I was wrong!

43
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,090
I was wrong!

44
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,150
I was wrong!

45
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:42,780
Are you hurt?

46
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:44,940
I'm fine.

47
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,570
I'm sorry. I misunderstood you before.

48
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,910
I didn't realize you did so much for me.

49
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:51,930
I didn't know what you had been through because of me...

50
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,930
I've already forgotten the past

51
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:56,370
and don't want to bring it up.

52
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,160
Just pretend

53
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,370
you didn't hear what he said earlier.

54
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:03,590
Where are you going?

55
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:04,990
Is Grandma in danger?

56
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:07,640
I'm not

57
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,870
intentionally following you.

58
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,070
I originally wanted to check on Grandma,

59
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:12,800
but I found out she's not there.

60
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,960
They took Grandma away.

61
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,000
They?

62
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,120
It's Li Meixing.

63
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,450
Give me one chance to make it up.

64
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,680
Let me go with you.

65
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:31,329
Luckily, Ms. Ruan's car has a tracking system.

66
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,620
Where is it?

67
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:35,800
The tracker shows

68
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,760
the car last stopped here.

69
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:41,450
-Isn't this my stepmother's place?
-Isn't this your stepmother's place?

70
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:43,860
You two newlyweds really are in sync.

71
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,350
Sorry, I'm his ex-wife.

72
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:49,970
Thank you.

73
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,700
I've helped you so many times.

74
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,010
Just saying thanks

75
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,160
won't cut it.

76
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:55,030
Fine.

77
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,810
Tell me

78
00:03:56,829 --> 00:03:57,630
what you want.

79
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,640
Hello?

80
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,730
Drive the car to the Bo family's old mansion gate.

81
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:03,790
Last time, when you had me follow that kidnapper's car,

82
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,360
you looked so anxious.

83
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:08,320
You two must be close.

84
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:10,510
I'll wait for the driver at the door.

85
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:11,270
Ruan Su.

86
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,430
Remember to pay.

87
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,120
Ruan Su.

88
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,560
Go to the hospital.

89
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,390
Hello?

90
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,510
My camera's all set,

91
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,750
but there's no one in this room.

92
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:23,480
Are you messing with me?

93
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,900
That's impossible. You must have the wrong place.

94
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:25,970
Don't call me again.

95
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,060
You're so unreliable.

96
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:27,690
Hey?

97
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:32,810
Go home.

98
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,070
Who are you?

99
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,920
What are you doing?

100
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:50,730
I'm Ruan Su.

101
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,750
Are you Mrs. Li's daughter?

102
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:54,770
Where's Grandma?

103
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,400
Is she home?

104
00:04:56,659 --> 00:04:58,230
Mrs. Li took her out.

105
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,220
She went out?

106
00:04:59,659 --> 00:05:00,660
Where did they go?

107
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:01,570
They went

108
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,820
shopping.

109
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,640
Mrs. Li said she would buy some new clothes for her.

110
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,570
Tell me.

111
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,420
Where is Grandma?

112
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:15,820
Don't make it difficult for me.

113
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,900
I really don't know where Grandma is.

114
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,510
You don't have to say anything,

115
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,440
but if illegal detention is found,

116
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,720
helping to cover it up is just as guilty as committing it.

117
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,900
You've worked in this house for so many years.

118
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:26,800
Don't you know

119
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,650
what kind of person Li Meixing really is?

120
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,480
When the time comes, she'll have everything ready

121
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,580
to pin on you.

122
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:33,390
Do you think you'll have any chance to defend yourself?

123
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:35,070
She's not that kind of person.

124
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,250
Forget it. Let's call the police.

125
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,190
I'll tell you.

126
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:42,420
(Mrs. Li)

127
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,320
Pick it up.
(Mrs. Li)

128
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:47,120
Mrs. Li.

129
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,830
Why aren't you replying?

130
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,390
Is everything okay at home?

131
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,390
I was cooking just now and didn't hear.

132
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,790
Everything's fine.

133
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,300
Don't worry, Mrs. Li.

134
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,890
Okay, I'll be home soon.

135
00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:00,020
Stay alert.

136
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,500
Ruan Su and the others may come here anytime.

137
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,760
Okay, Mrs. Li.

138
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:06,310
Let's go.

139
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:07,060
Lead the way.

140
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,040
Grandma!

141
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:15,740
Grandma!

142
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,840
Grandma, wake up!

143
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,680
Let's take her to the hospital.

144
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,390
Thank you for today.

145
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:31,130
If it weren't for you,

146
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,580
I wouldn't have been able to rescue Grandma so quickly.

147
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,310
Ruan Su,

148
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,650
there's no need to thank me.

149
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,520
You should go back first.

150
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:43,310
I'm sorry.

151
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,159
Ruan Su,

152
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:48,100
I didn't consider your feelings

153
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,760
in many things before.

154
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:51,909
I'll change from now on.

155
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:54,250
Please give me another chance.

156
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,690
Grandma needs to be taken care of.

157
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:58,820
I'll go in first.

158
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,710
Go home and rest.

159
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:13,430
Grandma, I brought your favorite soup.

160
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:18,020
No wonder you didn't let me check my phone.

161
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,350
If I hadn't overheard them talking in the bathroom just now,

162
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,590
when were you planning to tell me?

163
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:27,310
Grandma, don't believe the rumors online.

164
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:29,490
They are my business partners.

165
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:31,640
We just had a meal

166
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:32,770
and talked about work that day.

167
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:34,320
I don't blame you for this.

168
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:37,320
I don't

169
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:37,960
believe

170
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,900
what they said at all.

171
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,700
I believe you.

172
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,540
You are such a good child.

173
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,820
But I'm just angry.

174
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:48,200
How could they say those rumors about you?

175
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,240
Alright.

176
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,400
Don't be angry.

177
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,820
It's bad for your health.

178
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,190
Find out the source of the rumor now.

179
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:59,230
By the way,

180
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,240
send the evidence of Li Meixing secretly

181
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,840
transferring assets recently to Ruan Xinhua.

182
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,930
Mr. Bo, you're right.

183
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,920
Ruan Group has indeed been secretly

184
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,120
bringing in a large amount of

185
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,730
substandard construction materials.

186
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:14,680
Terminate the contract

187
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,510
with the Ruan Group immediately

188
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:18,130
for cutting corners and violating the principle of integrity.

189
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,070
I only tolerated her before

190
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,480
because she's

191
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,740
Ruan Su's stepmother.

192
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,120
But since she's treating Ruan Su like this,

193
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,780
there's no reason for me to hold back anymore.

194
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,590
Okay, I'll do it right away.

195
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:32,809
What?

196
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,650
Bo's Group is pulling its investment?

197
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,130
You idiots!

198
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,130
I told you to be careful.

199
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,270
Enough, stop talking.

200
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:40,450
I'll be right there.
