1
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,710
Let's get a divorce tomorrow.

2
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,479
You want to divorce me

3
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,039
just because of Grandma?

4
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,640
What you consider trivial

5
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,310
is what I care about the most.

6
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,200
Besides,

7
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:03,870
to you,

8
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,710
our marriage is just a deal,

9
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,920
isn't it?

10
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,150
It's time

11
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:12,360
to end this ridiculous farce.

12
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,590
Su,

13
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,590
I know

14
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,400
asking you to marry Xingzhi

15
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,930
is taking advantage of the situation,

16
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,710
but I genuinely hope you two

17
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,150
can get along.

18
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,000
It's okay if you don't want to.

19
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,910
I'll still support you

20
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,360
in starting a business.

21
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:40,710
I agreed not just out of gratitude.

22
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,750
After all, he saved me once.

23
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,970
Although he doesn't remember,

24
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:49,150
but I've always hoped to see him again.

25
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:55,590
Looks like

26
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,520
you're actually looking forward to this wedding.

27
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,310
You're here.

28
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,960
Even though you had Grandpa

29
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,190
force me to marry you,

30
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:04,840
you should know

31
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,630
I've already promised someone else

32
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,710
I'd take care of her.

33
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,010
It's not what you think.

34
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,470
Can you honestly say

35
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,670
you never took my grandfather's money?

36
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,520
It was a loan.

37
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,730
Women who can be handled with money

38
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,480
are the most convenient

39
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,120
and the cheapest.

40
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,360
Don't worry.

41
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,710
You're just a tool.

42
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,960
There will never be feelings between us.

43
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,360
Stop dreaming.

44
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,310
So, you've made up your mind?

45
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,750
You want a divorce?

46
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:43,520
Our marriage is a contract from the start.

47
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,870
A contract?

48
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,730
You're really that heartless?

49
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,079
Isn't this what you've been waiting for?

50
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,520
The divorce papers are ready.

51
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,630
I'm moving out today.

52
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,680
No need.

53
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,190
This villa is yours now.

54
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,520
I don't want it.

55
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,330
I'll leave without a penny.

56
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,030
Your things

57
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,360
are nothing to me.

58
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,430
Is dignity

59
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,410
really so important to someone like you?

60
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:21,430
If you don't want this villa,

61
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,600
how are you going to make a living?

62
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,930
Begging on the streets?

63
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,190
This is my own business.

64
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,680
Don't worry about it.

65
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,510
Okay.

66
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,750
Tomorrow is Grandpa's birthday.

67
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,080
He wants you to be there.

68
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,480
Even though we're getting a divorce,

69
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,280
I don't want you to embarrass me.

70
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,190
Your things,

71
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:51,270
the Bo family's, and you,

72
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,070
all make me feel disgusted.

73
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,390
Today is Old Mr. Bo's birthday.

74
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,250
Mr. Bo didn't bring Mrs. Bo along.

75
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:12,270
She must not be presentable. I've never seen Mr. Bo

76
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,040
bring her to a public event.

77
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,240
Mrs. Bo?

78
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,830
She threw herself at him.

79
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,260
She doesn't deserve to be called Mrs. Bo.

80
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,430
Call Ruan Su again

81
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:28,680
and tell her to come here immediately.

82
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,240
Yes.

83
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:30,960
Old Mr. Bo.

84
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:32,600
Thank you.

85
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,320
Thank you for coming.

86
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:35,960
Grandpa,

87
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,240
everyone is here.

88
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:41,390
Is everyone here?

89
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,970
Your wife hasn't arrived yet.

90
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,270
Didn't you see?

91
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,560
Grandpa, don't waste time.

92
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,960
She's too scared to come.

93
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,240
Four years of humiliation and sacrifice

94
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,870
are finally over.

95
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,480
I'm going to live life my way.

96
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:07,190
I won't spare anyone

97
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,430
who has hurt me.

98
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,270
Sir,

99
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,070
there's a long traffic jam on the designated route,

100
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,730
and we can't get there on time.

101
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,830
Change the route and inform the group secretary

102
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,720
to open the internal passage,

103
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,320
ensuring the route remains clear.

104
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,360
Yes.

105
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,070
You're here.

106
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,880
I'm glad you're here.

107
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,720
Grandpa, I wish you prosperity

108
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,800
and longevity.

109
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,870
Thank you.

110
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,920
Are you crazy?

111
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,120
You had money to rent all those cars

112
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,650
but couldn't afford a gift?

113
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,460
I know you like Ru Kiln porcelain,

114
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,810
so I specially prepared this gift for you.

115
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:32,560
Is this

116
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,830
the round sky-blue glazed brush pot

117
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:37,290
that was bought for a huge sum by some mystery buyer last month?

118
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,600
I know you like it,

119
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,270
so I bought it at the auction.

120
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:41,870
Good.

121
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:43,920
Great.

122
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,120
Wonderful!

123
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,920
Old Mr. Bo, the banquet is ready.

124
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,870
Let's have everyone take their seats.

125
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:53,430
Okay.

126
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:56,430
Everyone, please take your seats.

127
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:57,750
Let's go.

128
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,360
Shall we talk?

129
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,630
Where did you get that?

130
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,330
It's none of your business.

131
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:08,240
You've been treating me like I didn't exist these past four years, haven't you?

132
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,870
The divorce papers are ready.

133
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,000
Once you sign them,

134
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,820
we'll have nothing to do with each other.

135
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,120
Tell me,

136
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,070
what is it?

137
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:29,070
We have nothing to talk about.

138
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:38,610
And you don't need to dig into my past.

139
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,480
Stop.

140
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,120
Tell us,

141
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,980
where did you get that porcelain?

142
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,040
Is this how you waste the money my brother gave you?

143
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,000
When will you two siblings

144
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,860
finally learn to use your brains?

145
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,150
You have so much money.

146
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:04,390
Did you get it from some rich man you hooked up with?

147
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,870
You must have worked hard.

148
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,120
The Bo family

149
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,440
won't accept something so tainted.

150
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,000
You're so eager to see your brother get cheated on, huh?

151
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,600
He likes to get entangled with someone else while married,

152
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,330
but I'm not interested in that.

153
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,600
You don't think

154
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,670
I'll let you humiliate me

155
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:38,200
like you used to, do you?

156
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,550
Sister Su, today is your birthday.

157
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,700
Xingzhi forgot it, but we didn't.

158
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,550
This is a cake for you.

159
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,550
It's fine. No need.

160
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,840
Sister Su, why are you eating in such a hurry?

161
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:57,670
Wenyu told us

162
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,200
to prepare this cake especially for you.

163
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,030
What are you waiting for?

164
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,270
Let's take Sister Su to wash up.

165
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:01,840
Hurry!

166
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:04,120
Let's take Sister Su to wash up!

167
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,240
Here.

168
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,720
Let us help you wash up.

169
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,960
The eldest daughter-in-law of the Bo family is so unpresentable.

170
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,630
She must have used some tricks to marry in.

171
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:11,690
What are you doing?

172
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,750
Xingzhi,

173
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:19,030
we were just kidding with Sister Su.

174
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:20,440
Let's go.

175
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,360
If you can't tolerate this kind of humiliation,

176
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,200
then just don't show up in public

177
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:29,510
and embarrass me.

178
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:36,510
Bo Wenyu

179
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,750
faked her thesis

180
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,750
and tried to use the family's influence to cover it up.

181
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,750
Bo Wenhao

182
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,670
is involved in school bullying,

183
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:46,200
beating a boy into voluntarily dropping out,

184
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,630
and is planning to use money to settle it.

185
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:48,270
Enough.

186
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,910
You're really spoiled.

187
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,240
Grandpa has always been upright

188
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,570
and values reputation.

189
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,150
If he finds out,

190
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,980
do you think he'll let you off?

191
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:02,960
If I expose these things,

192
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,630
do you think the Bo family will protect you?

193
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,000
How did you know these?

194
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,790
That's not important.

195
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,040
As for whether others will know,

196
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,440
it depends on how you behave.

197
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:15,750
Hurry.

198
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:16,200
Hurry.

199
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:17,480
Sister Su,

200
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,440
we were wrong.

201
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,440
We were wrong, Sister Su.

202
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,080
It's fine.

203
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,400
You just need to have some cake.

204
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,080
Well, Sister Su...

205
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:24,840
Oh, right.

206
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,280
I forgot to tell you.

207
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,810
I'm not your sister-in-law anymore.

208
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,840
Don't call me that

209
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:30,870
in the future.

210
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:42,840
You're eating so quickly.

211
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,040
Do you need to wash up?

212
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:56,960
Ruan Su!

213
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,030
Enough!

214
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:21,630
Ruan Su,

215
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,490
in these four years,

216
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:26,240
how many secrets have you been keeping from me?
