1
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:47,750
How is it, Su?

2
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,670
Finally, you don't have to endure it.

3
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:51,000
Are you in a good mood?

4
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:55,320
Yes, but they're not the point.

5
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,470
My target is someone else.

6
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:00,560
Okay, Su.

7
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:03,840
Thanks to Mr. Bo's investment.

8
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,350
It's been four years.

9
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,020
Our company has grown from a startup team

10
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,560
into the hottest rising star

11
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,789
in the business world.

12
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,520
By the way,

13
00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:19,480
are you still going to volunteer for free TCM consultations?

14
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,590
Of course. A promise is a promise.

15
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,330
That's something I swore to my master.

16
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,920
According to the prescription I gave you last time,

17
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,230
just take two more doses and you'll be fine.

18
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:29,039
Thank you, little miracle doctor!

19
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:30,500
Please don't call me that.

20
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,680
I think our Su

21
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,610
definitely lives up to that title.

22
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,430
In these three years, you've learned

23
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:39,289
all my medical skills and Li's massage techniques.

24
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,640
You're ready to strike out on your own.

25
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,150
Go help more people.

26
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:45,400
Now that I'm leaving the mountain,

27
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,759
I won't forget the teachings

28
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:47,789
of yours.

29
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,900
You've worked hard these past few years.

30
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,400
Ruan Su, pour me a glass of water.

31
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,759
I just had some drinks with a client.

32
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,690
I made this for you. Eat it while it's hot.

33
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,710
This shirt's so wrinkled.

34
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,840
I'll iron it for you before you wear it.

35
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,030
I'll be done soon.

36
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,090
Can you wait for me?

37
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:48,840
Hello?

38
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,770
Where did you go?

39
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,590
What's it to you?

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,400
We are getting divorced.

41
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,310
I can go wherever I want.

42
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,090
Why should I report to you?

43
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,520
What happened?

44
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,190
Who is that guy?

45
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,680
I told you, it's none of your business.

46
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:10,050
You want a divorce, right?

47
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,150
Fine.

48
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,080
Come back.

49
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,010
I'll sign the papers right now.

50
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,280
Fine.

51
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,520
You said it.

52
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,579
I'll be right back.

53
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,630
Okay.

54
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,480
You're quick to show up.

55
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,100
So eager for a divorce?

56
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:38,680
What,

57
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,360
you're not?

58
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,880
Your lovely little “sister”

59
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,430
has been dying to shack up with you.

60
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,390
Who was that man who picked you up today?

61
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,370
Already hooked a new one, huh?

62
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,360
Is that how filthy your mind is?

63
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,400
You're crazy.

64
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,150
No, I'm not.

65
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:08,800
Do you really

66
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,660
not feel anything for me anymore?

67
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,370
Your beloved little “sister” is calling.

68
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:20,680
Aren't you going to answer?

69
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,210
Aren't you going to answer?

70
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:28,360
Hello?

71
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:29,750
Xingzhi.

72
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,500
I think someone's trying to open my door.

73
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,000
I'll send someone right over.

74
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,510
Aren't you coming yourself?

75
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:37,040
Didn't you promise

76
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,870
to always take care of me?

77
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,750
Okay. I'm on my way.

78
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,310
Okay.

79
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,290
I'm heading out.

80
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:47,720
Wait for me at home.

81
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,680
You think I'll just keep

82
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,680
sitting around waiting like a fool?

83
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,070
I'm leaving.

84
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,560
Don't forget to sign the papers.

85
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,360
Sign them

86
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,000
and mail them to me.

87
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,040
Four years...

88
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,680
You really haven't changed at all.

89
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:23,830
Hello?

90
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,680
Xingzhi.

91
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:27,190
My heart's racing so fast.

92
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:28,830
Can you come pick me up?

93
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,240
Okay, I got it. Wait for me.

94
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,450
I've got something urgent, gotta go.

95
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,000
Didn't you promise

96
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,750
to come with me to visit Grandma?

97
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,800
Do you know how long

98
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,240
she's been waiting for this day?

99
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,190
Before we got married,

100
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:44,870
I told you

101
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,800
I have someone I need to take care of.

102
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,270
Su.

103
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:52,920
Grandma.

104
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:55,510
Xingzhi had something come up at work.

105
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,210
I'll bring him next time, okay?

106
00:05:58,950 --> 00:05:59,950
It's alright, it's alright.

107
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:00,510
Look,

108
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,040
I bought your favorite dishes.

109
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,920
I'll make them

110
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,070
and we'll eat together.

111
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:04,600
Let's go.

112
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,240
Xingzhi,

113
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:16,630
who is she?

114
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,470
Bringing your mistress home

115
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:20,160
in broad daylight?

116
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,510
No, I...

117
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,360
Mistress?

118
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,870
I think you're talking about your own granddaughter.

119
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:25,430
I think you're talking about your own granddaughter.

120
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:25,870
You...

121
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
She's the one who stepped in

122
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,630
She's the one who stepped in

123
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,240
and forced Xingzhi to marry her.

124
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,390
If anyone's the shameless homewrecker, it's her.

125
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,190
Xingzhi,

126
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,290
what kind of person are you dating?

127
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:35,680
I...

128
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,070
Grandma.

129
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,510
Grandma!

130
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,430
Grandma.

131
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,960
All these years of marriage,

132
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,060
what have I had besides humiliation?

133
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,190
Fine. Let's divorce.

134
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,120
That's what I've been wishing for.

135
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,120
Bo Xingzhi,

136
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,720
you finally got what you wanted.

137
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,190
Congratulations, boss,

138
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:06,870
freedom at last!

139
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,270
Congratulations, boss,

140
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,920
free from misery!

141
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,750
Any lingering feelings I had for you

142
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,270
are long gone.

143
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,480
Now, I have

144
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,720
more important things to do.

145
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,130
Where is the person, Ziyin?

146
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,680
Who?

147
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,159
Maybe someone knocked on the wrong door.

148
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:35,820
There was no noise after that.

149
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,630
Alright then,

150
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:38,880
I'm heading out.

151
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,070
Xingzhi.

152
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,920
I've been feeling really

153
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,430
off lately.

154
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,920
I keep breaking out in cold sweat.

155
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,800
My assistant went back to her hometown too.

156
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,510
I'm living here all alone…

157
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,430
What if something happens to me?

158
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:55,360
Can I stay at your place for a while?

159
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,560
I just want to crash there for a bit.

160
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:01,120
If you're worried your wife will be mad,

161
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:02,920
then forget it.

162
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,310
I'll manage by myself.

163
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,600
Wake up!

164
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,560
What's wrong?

165
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,480
Wake up!

166
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,190
Hello? 120?

167
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,440
Someone's fainted!

168
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,270
You saved me?

169
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,950
Thank you.

170
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:24,950
No matter when you need me,

171
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,480
I'll be there.

172
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,190
You can come.

173
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,840
Pack up your things.

174
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,240
I'll take you to a TCM doctor for treatment.

175
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,750
My dearest brother,

176
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,600
Ruan Xinjian.

177
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:53,910
How did you get in?

178
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,080
Why can't I come in?

179
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,900
What are you doing?

180
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,340
Got another perfect score, huh, Ruan Su?

181
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,630
Trying to show off

182
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,510
to that old man again?

183
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,010
Give that to me!

184
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,150
Don't get mad,

185
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,610
you want it? Here, take it!

186
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,080
Let go of me! Let me go!

187
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,010
Stop screaming.

188
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,000
Listen.

189
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:31,960
If you embarrass me

190
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,620
in front of that old man again,

191
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,450
you'll see what I'll do to you.

192
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:36,960
Let go!

193
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,510
Help!

194
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,150
What are you yelling about

195
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,610
in the middle of the night?

196
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,750
She said she wanted to do sit-ups

197
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,320
and asked me to hold her legs.

198
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,120
Get up!

199
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:54,720
What are you doing?

200
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,050
You little seductress,

201
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:58,750
trying to hook your stepbrother dressed like that?

202
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,240
If your dad finds out,

203
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,510
you're done for.

204
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,000
Get up.

205
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,530
Let's go.

206
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,790
It was bound to happen sooner or later.

207
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,000
Brat.

208
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:17,510
Mom.

209
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,630
If you want to teach her a lesson again,

210
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:19,600
talk to me first.

211
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,030
If your dad finds out, we're in trouble.

212
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:22,560
Let's go.

213
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,910
Let's start with you then.
