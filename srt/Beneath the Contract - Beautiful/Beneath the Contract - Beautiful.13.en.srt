1
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,230
(Beautiful)

2
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,210
(Episode 13)

3
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:44,700
Su,

4
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,300
the deal with Mr. Wang is finalized.

5
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,220
This is the resume of Li Meixing's secretary.

6
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,750
Have HR handle the process.

7
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,980
You got the records from Ruan's Group's

8
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,040
illegal business?

9
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,820
This is her condition for the exchange with me.

10
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,100
Keep her at Hengjiu.

11
00:00:59,100 --> 00:00:59,980
Perhaps in the future,

12
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,340
she might be of use.

13
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:02,500
It's a fair trade.

14
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,300
Got it.

15
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:06,540
Oh, right.

16
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,620
I found the reporter who wrote

17
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,280
that smear article about you.

18
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,910
He said the photos came from the Cheng family.

19
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,510
What do you think

20
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,580
Cheng Ziyin and Bo Xingzhi

21
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:18,940
are up to?

22
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,260
Bo Xingzhi?

23
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:29,740
Okay.

24
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:30,860
I got it.

25
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,610
(Clinic)

26
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:35,580
Grandma.

27
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,509
Ruan Su has been too busy with work lately.

28
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:40,700
I'll be seeing you these days.

29
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:41,820
We've switched.

30
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:43,940
Thank you.

31
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,780
Actually, I've always

32
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,140
felt guilty about Su.

33
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:55,490
Not long after her mom passed,

34
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,780
her dad

35
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,740
brought that woman

36
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,500
and her child

37
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,900
home.

38
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,020
Mom.

39
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,660
From now on,

40
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,190
they're part of our family.

41
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:09,979
Mom.

42
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,500
Su, call her Mom.

43
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,260
No!

44
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:15,900
You stubborn kid.

45
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,520
Don't rush.

46
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,940
She just needs time to adjust.

47
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,400
Ruan Su,

48
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,230
you're such a good girl.

49
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,230
Honey,

50
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,530
Su seems to hate me.

51
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,120
Ruan Su, your mother is gone now.

52
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,660
No one will put up with your bad temper anymore.

53
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,230
Clear out your room later

54
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,220
and give it to your brother.

55
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:43,180
You're just a girl.

56
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,579
You don't need such a big room.

57
00:02:44,579 --> 00:02:45,380
Got it?

58
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,940
I really shouldn't have allowed him

59
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,140
to bring that mother and son

60
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,540
into our home.

61
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,060
Since then,

62
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,720
Su's been constantly bullied by them.

63
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,820
I couldn't bear

64
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,900
to see her get bullied.

65
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,800
Every winter and summer holiday,

66
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,120
I sent her

67
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,680
to some mountain villages,

68
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,310
asking the hermits and masters there

69
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:12,300
to teach her survival skills.

70
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,660
She was so young back then.

71
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,130
How strong could her will be?

72
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,450
But she actually held on.

73
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:25,900
Grandma,

74
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,480
you don't have to feel guilty.

75
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,010
Ruan Su

76
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,460
is a strong person now.

77
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,910
Grandma, what village are you talking about?

78
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,430
What are you doing here?

79
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,100
He's here to take care of me.

80
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,420
Come out with me.

81
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:48,110
Grandma,

82
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,230
I'll come and see you next time.

83
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:53,700
(Ward) (Operating Room) (Treatment Room)

84
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,500
What's wrong?
(Ward) (Operating Room) (Treatment Room)

85
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:55,980
You don't need to

86
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,640
worry about Grandma anymore.

87
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:59,980
Take care of your own people first.

88
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,710
(How have you been lately?)

89
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,700
How have you been lately?

90
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,220
I thought of a good idea

91
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,980
to finish off Ruan Su.

92
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,810
Do you want to work with me again?

93
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,120
Xingzhi, you're back.

94
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,550
Take a look at this yourself.

95
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:33,510
What is this?

96
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,470
How can she slander me so casually?

97
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,140
Ziyin,

98
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,100
I don't know how

99
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,020
you became like this.

100
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,580
Stop doing these shady things.

101
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,580
If it happens again,

102
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,460
don't blame me for not considering our past relationship

103
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,260
and breaking my promises to you.

104
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,610
Also,

105
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,820
I gave you the password to my house

106
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,659
because you said no one was

107
00:04:59,659 --> 00:05:00,740
looking after you.

108
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,640
That doesn't mean you can treat this place

109
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,740
like your own home.

110
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,710
Leave as soon as your assistant gets back.

111
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,270
He's not really going to abandon me, is he?

112
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:29,100
(Hide Alerts)

113
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:32,090
(Assistant)

114
00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:34,380
Hello.

115
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,220
Go talk to Mr. Wang,

116
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,620
find out their attitude,

117
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,540
and check if there are

118
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,700
any business resources that might suit me.

119
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,600
Yes, try your best.

120
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:45,340
Go straight ahead and turn right.

121
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,020
(Jiangxia City Ping'an Hospital)
Go straight ahead and turn right.

122
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:46,140
(Jiangxia City Ping'an Hospital)

123
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:46,940
Thank you.

(Jiangxia City Ping'an Hospital)

125
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:51,490
You didn't answer my calls.

126
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,330
I've been looking all over for you. Give me the money.

127
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:54,610
Have you no shame?

128
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:55,690
You're the head of the family.

129
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:56,690
It's bad enough that you do nothing

130
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,110
and laze around all day,

131
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,970
but now you're asking me for money? What are you thinking?

132
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:01,430
You're the shameless one.

133
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:03,240
You drove our company into bankruptcy.

134
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,150
From now on, you're covering all my expenses.

135
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:06,070
Give it to me!

136
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,200
Give it to me!

137
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:07,300
(Jiangxia City Ping'an Hospital)
Give it to me!

138
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,120
(Jiangxia City Ping'an Hospital)

139
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,580
Don't think I don't know

140
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,550
you secretly transferred 50 million

141
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:13,550
from our family account a while ago.

142
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,520
How did you know about that?

143
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,180
That's none of your business.

144
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,140
Is this all?

145
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:18,990
I'm telling you,

146
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:20,310
next time I come for money,

147
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,340
if it's still this little,

148
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,160
don't blame me for hitting you!

149
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,000
(Jiangxia City Ping'an Hospital)
don't blame me for hitting you!

150
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,860
(Jiangxia City Ping'an Hospital)

151
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:37,610
Ruan Su, you bitch!

152
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:38,909
I'm like this

153
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,340
all because of you!

154
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:41,650
You're happy now that

155
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:42,670
I'm beneath your feet, aren't you?

156
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:43,470
Aren't you?

157
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,740
You're wrong.

158
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:47,540
You deserve it.

159
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,850
You're as mean as your mother.

160
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,560
But that doesn't matter.

161
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,500
She ended up being killed

162
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,250
by the person closest to her.

163
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,280
What did you say?

164
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:57,970
I said

165
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,650
you're just as disgusting as your mother.

166
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,770
What did you mean when you said she was killed

167
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:04,850
by the person closest to her?

168
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:06,300
It doesn't mean anything.

169
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,420
You misheard.

170
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:08,650
Let go of me!

171
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,300
Are you alright?

172
00:07:38,409 --> 00:07:40,010
Are you feeling sorry for me?

173
00:07:40,409 --> 00:07:41,970
Ruan Su, I just want to...

174
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,780
Don't forget,

175
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,950
you once hurt me too.

176
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:47,550
You're no different from them.

177
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,390
The car accident that happened to your mother back then,

178
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,650
although it was an accident,

179
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:08,780
was very likely caused by negligence.

180
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,250
That year, my dad wanted to take my mom on a road trip,

181
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,850
and she agreed immediately.

182
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,680
But then the accident happened.

183
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,520
My dad had been driving all day.

184
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,510
Just before they arrived,

185
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,340
the accident occurred.

186
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,170
Are you saying

187
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,320
the accident

188
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,820
was caused by his fatigued driving?

189
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,860
There was no surveillance at the scene.

190
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,030
He told us

191
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:37,200
the accident was caused by brake failure.

192
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:40,090
I don't know.

193
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,880
Maybe I'm just too suspicious.

194
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,460
Oh, Xinyu,

195
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:47,640
don't rush to submit the reports

196
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,640
on Li Meixing yet.

197
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:50,290
As for Ruan Xinhua,

198
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:53,150
if he really was responsible for what happened back then,

199
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:55,190
he'll eventually slip up.

200
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,060
By then,

201
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,400
I'll make the arrangements.

202
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,030
You don't need to do anything.

203
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:05,010
Just appear in front of him,

204
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,430
and he'll naturally take the bait.

205
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:07,090
Don't worry.

206
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:08,370
What I enjoy most

207
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,180
is punishing habitual cheaters like him.

208
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,580
Once you take the photos,

209
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,020
your task will be over.

210
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:13,660
No need.

211
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:15,650
When it ends is up to me.

212
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,060
We were classmates for so many years.

213
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,500
I'll definitely help you with this.
