1
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:49,600
Nine Circles.

2
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:52,110
It sucks.

3
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:58,350
Got it.

4
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,600
I win!

5
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:03,200
You're having a lucky day, huh?

6
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,230
Treat us later!

7
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,030
No problem, no problem. Come on!

8
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:08,590
By the way,

9
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:09,510
I heard your sister,

10
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,480
who married into a rich family, got divorced.

11
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,350
Her name is...

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,860
Ruan Su, right?

13
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:15,430
Who told you that?

14
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:16,950
A friend of mine works at the Bo family.

15
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,070
The whole thing's been all over the place for a while now.

16
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:19,680
Really?

17
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,680
Your own sister was kicked out,

18
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,350
and you didn't even know?

19
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,710
Well, I... I've got something to do right now.

20
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:26,280
Let's play again another time!

21
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,039
-Where are you going?
-Didn't you say you were going to treat us?

22
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:29,500
I know. I will definitely!

23
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:33,270
Do we need to make a move on the Bo family?

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,789
No need.

25
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:36,759
Let's end it like this.

26
00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:39,720
The Ruan family is the real target.

27
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,200
The word's out, right?

28
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,200
Rest assured,

29
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,080
I've taken care of everything.

30
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,200
Well done.

31
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,280
Now,

32
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:52,690
we can just wait for the fish to take the bait.

33
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,759
Ruan Su?

34
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:00,690
Why are you here?

35
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,690
You need something?

36
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:04,680
Are you sick?

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,260
You should worry about your precious little sister first.

38
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,079
I'll transfer some money to you.

39
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:17,470
Could you let them go in first?

40
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,310
I really can't.

41
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,470
I'm in a hurry to see the doctor too.

42
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:19,960
Thank you.

43
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,710
Sorry.

44
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,079
Auntie.

45
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,910
Would you be willing to let me have your spot

46
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,630
if I give you some money?

47
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,360
You think I need your little bit of money?

48
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,520
We're also here to see the doctor!

49
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,870
We've been waiting in line for a long time!

50
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:37,590
Just

51
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,470
go to the back and wait your turn!

52
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:40,079
That's right.

53
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:42,310
Do you know how hard it is to get an appointment with Dr. Ruan?

54
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,079
Ridiculous.

55
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,000
Unbelievable.

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,030
It's okay, Xingzhi.

57
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,120
I heard that the doctors here

58
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,150
are really strict about the rules.

59
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,840
They don't let patients cut in line.

60
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,000
Let's just wait.

61
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,060
What are you doing?

62
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,630
People are waiting in line here,

63
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,520
can't you see?

64
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,330
How can you jump the queue?

65
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,560
The one just now is

66
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,910
our hospital's chief TCM doctor for today's free clinic.

67
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,310
Please keep quiet in the hospital.

68
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,400
If you keep causing a disturbance,

69
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,000
I'll have to ask you to leave.

70
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,560
How could she possibly be a doctor?

71
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,079
You don't even know who the doctor is,

72
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:19,280
and you came to see her?

73
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,590
That's really funny.

74
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,560
Good thing Dr. Ruan is gracious.

75
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:23,910
What if she gets angry

76
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,710
and doesn't want to treat us?

77
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,310
No wonder she always disappears for a few days every month.

78
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:32,310
Yet I never paid any attention to it.

79
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,470
Come on, come in.

80
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,120
Okay.

81
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,190
Xingzhi.

82
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,150
She deliberately kept it from you.

83
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,280
She's a fraud.

84
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,150
She must be up to something.

85
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:45,960
Let's go.

86
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,800
Let's see another doctor.

87
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,860
We'll see this one.

88
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,280
She's wearing such heavy makeup.

89
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,470
She clearly isn't professional.

90
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:53,329
Who knows what kind of prescriptions she gives out!

91
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,810
Hold out your wrist.

92
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,710
What do you want?

93
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,840
Aren't you sick?

94
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,080
Your pulse is neither floating nor sunken,

95
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,340
and the rhythm is even.

96
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,750
Four or five beats per breath

97
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,680
and about 60 to 90 beats per minute.

98
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,850
Overall, you're very healthy,

99
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,750
not sick.

100
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,300
But I just don't feel well.

101
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:17,279
Then perhaps it's just a case of "drama queen syndrome."

102
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,360
Now that I've checked you, leave now.

103
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,620
Don't affect others who need treatment.

104
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,800
You've been a doctor for so many years.

105
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,270
Why didn't you ever tell me?

106
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,270
Was it necessary?

107
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,430
Did you ever ask?

108
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,560
'Sup.

109
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,830
Long time no see.

110
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,680
What have you been up to lately?

111
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,120
Making good money somewhere, huh?

112
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,580
Why didn't you give me, your brother, a call?

113
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,430
You've gotten prettier.

114
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,690
Looks like you've been doing quite well.

115
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:05,310
I heard you were thrown out of the Bo family.

116
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,190
Is that true?

117
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:09,120
You really won't change, will you?

118
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,720
Not even if I were dead.

119
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:12,750
I was thinking,

120
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,160
if you ever made it big,

121
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,430
you could help me out.

122
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,390
Well...

123
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,680
it's only been a few days.

124
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,830
You've been abandoned so quickly.

125
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,690
What does that have to do with you?

126
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:24,160
How could it not have to do with me?

127
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,360
I'm your brother.

128
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:27,930
Since we were kids,

129
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:30,040
haven't I always taken care of your affairs?

130
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,870
If you can

131
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:32,930
make me happy today

132
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,270
and beg me,

133
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,630
maybe I'll take you in.

134
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,240
We'll live together

135
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,310
just like before.

136
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:42,310
Come on.

137
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:50,480
What are you doing?

138
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,940
Try laying a hand on her and see what happens.

139
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:54,600
Come on, we're family.

140
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,830
It's me.

141
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:57,550
Ruan Xinjian,

142
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,630
your brother-in-law.

143
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,680
Ex-brother-in-law, don't get me wrong.

144
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,430
I heard

145
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,750
that you kicked her out.

146
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:05,630
So, as her brother,

147
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,160
I was just teaching her a lesson.

148
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,750
She got so many things wrong.

149
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,190
She did nothing wrong.

150
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,040
And...

151
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,750
Wait, if she...

152
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,610
Even if she did,

153
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,070
it's not your place to interfere.

154
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,870
Get lost.

155
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,070
What did you say?

156
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:16,800
Get lost!

157
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:18,240
You...

158
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,360
Fine, I'll leave.

159
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,070
If this happens again,

160
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:29,830
tell me.

161
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,720
What?

162
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,480
Suddenly caring now we're divorced?

163
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,600
No,

164
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,730
don't overthink it.

165
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,830
I just don't want others to think

166
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,430
that they can bully my woman.

167
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,720
You're so full of yourself.

168
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,120
Even if you weren't here,

169
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,720
he wouldn't be able to do anything to me.

170
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,600
But you...

171
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,190
why are you here?

172
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,020
You owe me an explanation.

173
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,000
The birthday gift earlier,

174
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,240
you, as the doctor, the other day—

175
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,040
what else are you hiding from me?

176
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,600
Plenty.

177
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,830
But you don't need to know.

178
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,920
It's not that I was chicken.

179
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,720
Why would I be chicken?

180
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:15,430
Next time I run into her,

181
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,310
you'll see if I'm afraid of her or not!

182
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,270
That little girl.

183
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,120
Yes.

184
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:23,720
Acting so high and mighty in front of me!

185
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,050
I'll teach her a lesson.

186
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:25,840
That's it.

187
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,480
What the hell?

188
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:37,170
No sense of public hygiene at all.

189
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,720
Littering everywhere.

190
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,870
I'm watching your every move.

191
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:45,870
You'd better not step out of line.

192
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,090
Otherwise,

193
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,600
don't blame me when I show no mercy.

194
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,190
Who is it?

195
00:07:58,159 --> 00:07:59,040
Come out!

196
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,430
I'm telling you, don't

197
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:04,290
try to scare me with these tricks!

198
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,790
Warning him like this...

199
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,270
if he really gets scared off and doesn't dare to act again,

200
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,630
will you let him off?

201
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,270
That would be like giving him

202
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:15,000
a chance to turn over a new leaf.

203
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,720
But from what I know of him,

204
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,220
not only will he not be afraid,

205
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,560
but he'll get worse.

206
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,560
This way, I can make him pay for what he owes me

207
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,270
and for all the humiliation.

208
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,360
At that time,

209
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:32,270
he'll only have himself to blame.

210
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:35,590
Hello, Mr. Bo.

211
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,929
-Hello, Mr. Bo.
-Hello, Mr. Bo.

212
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:44,840
-Mr. Bo, hello.
-Mr. Bo, hello.

213
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:52,970
Mr. Bo, this is Ms. Ruan's personal profile.

214
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,480
Over the past few years, Ms. Ruan

215
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,910
has successfully treated dozens of difficult and complex cases.

216
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,440
Her medical skills are indeed excellent.

217
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,240
And I specifically had someone pull up her records.

218
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,030
She really was the top scorer

219
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,790
in the college entrance exam that year.

220
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,150
She was only 16 then.

221
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:07,030
But there's something very strange—

222
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:09,030
there's no information about her online at all.

223
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,080
It's like...

224
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,500
It's like someone deleted it on purpose.

225
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,320
Yes.

226
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:35,050
-Welcome, Ms. Ruan!
-Welcome, Ms. Ruan!

227
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,630
Su, you're finally back.

228
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,030
Who is that woman?

229
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,360
I've never seen her before.

230
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,720
You're new here, so you don't know.

231
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,270
This is our boss.

232
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:57,200
90 percent of our Hengjiu Tech Group's annual profits

233
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,840
come from her patents.

234
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,080
And her side job is as a doctor.

235
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,870
A doctor? That impressive?

236
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,030
By the way,

237
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:07,630
the Huo family's charity gala invitation

238
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:08,760
has been delivered.

239
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,750
Decline it.

240
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,960
But I heard

241
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,150
that the behind-the-scenes boss of Hengjiu Tech Group,

242
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:17,950
with whom you particularly want to collaborate, will also be there.

243
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,960
Tell the Huo family I'll attend.

244
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,320
Okay, Mr. Bo.

245
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:36,750
Hello?

246
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,360
Accompany me to

247
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,870
a charity gala tomorrow night.

248
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:40,670
No.

249
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:43,600
I don't make a habit of attending events with my ex-husband.

250
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,240
Ruan Su,

251
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,390
as long as you haven't divorced me for a day,

252
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,080
you're still Mrs. Bo.

253
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:49,630
You must make time

254
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,230
to go with me tomorrow night.

255
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,270
Xingzhi,

256
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,670
were you just talking about

257
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,080
the Huo family gala?

258
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:07,890
I've never been to one.

259
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:08,840
Why are you here?

260
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,360
Well, you haven't

261
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,020
seemed like yourself lately,

262
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,080
so I came to check on you.

263
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,080
Don't let

264
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,120
irrelevant people or things

265
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,550
get to you.

266
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,480
I would worry about you.

267
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,510
I won't, Ziyin.

268
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:24,840
But...

269
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,750
non-staff aren't allowed in the office areas.

270
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,630
You should keep that in mind.

271
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,720
I'm sorry, Xingzhi.

272
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,720
I just happened to overhear

273
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,850
you talking about the Huo family gala,

274
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,270
so I thought

275
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,630
if you didn't have a partner,

276
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:45,090
you could take me with you.

277
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,440
Xingzhi, please promise me.

278
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,630
Please take me.

279
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:49,240
Alright, alright.

280
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,370
Fine, I'll take you.

281
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,550
Just put on a bit of makeup.

282
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,880
You all can take a break.

283
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,200
No way.

284
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:01,390
Today is

285
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,870
your first appearance as

286
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,360
the boss of our Hengjiu Tech Group.

287
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,550
Many CEOs

288
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,410
are coming specifically for you.

289
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:09,720
But...

290
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,150
someone like you,

291
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:13,080
a natural-born, stunning beauty,

292
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,900
will still outshine everyone

293
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:17,080
even without makeup.

294
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,010
Beautiful lady,

295
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,640
would I have the honor

296
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,850
of being your date tonight?

297
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,630
I'll have to think about it.

298
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:29,960
I can consider...

299
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:32,670
being your date instead.

300
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,670
Then I'll have to think about it.

301
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,750
You're getting bolder.
