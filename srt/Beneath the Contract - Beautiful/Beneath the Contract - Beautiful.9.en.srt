(Episode 9)

3
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:47,670
I've received the composition.

4
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:48,670
It's really good.

5
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,490
You really weren't lying to me.

6
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:52,610
Of course, Xuehai's compositions never disappoint.

7
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:55,550
You can just wait to amaze everyone
on the day of the competition.

8
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:57,450
But using his piece directly...

9
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,680
Rest assured.

10
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,160
It's just an internal competition,

11
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,930
and Xuehai has long been traveling around the world.

12
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:02,970
Besides,

13
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,650
tons of people plagiarize and copy his work,

14
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,900
yet he doesn't even care.

15
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,950
This is just one of his discarded compositions.

16
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:11,280
Just treat it like your own original work.

17
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,000
Alright, then I'm relieved.

18
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:15,530
Ziyin.

19
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:17,730
Mr. Wang.

20
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,370
I've heard about it.

21
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,140
I didn't know you were so talented.

22
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,550
You should have told me earlier.

23
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:24,560
You could have achieved much more than
your current success.

24
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,320
Don't worry.

25
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,520
We will promote you well

26
00:01:27,539 --> 00:01:29,670
and help you become a top-tier singer.

27
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,580
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

28
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,170
Alright, I'll be going now.

29
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,490
I'll definitely give it my all.

30
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,610
This time, Xingzhi

31
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,170
will surely come back to me.

32
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:42,550
Ruan Su, without this backer,

33
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:45,259
let's see how long you can remain smug.

34
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,160
Now, please welcome our final contestant,

35
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,880
who will be performing an original song.

36
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,160
Let's all look forward to it.

Miss Cheng,

76
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,160
you said that this song is your original work?

77
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,339
Yeah.

78
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:21,329
What?

79
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,760
Are you jealous?

80
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,050
Not really.

81
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,640
But I was wondering

82
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:29,250
why the arrangement sounds awfully similar

83
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,450
to a song my friend Xuehai composed

84
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,760
when he was young.

85
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,480
So, Miss Cheng,

86
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,330
could you show your original manuscript

87
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:39,370
for comparison?

88
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,300

00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,700
it's your friend who plagiarized my work?

110
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:38,840

112
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,090
She always bullies you.

It's okay. I'm used to it.

114
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,540
Look, I've written a bunch of scores.

115
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,500
I don't understand them.

116
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,300
It's okay.

117
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,390
When I grow up and turn them into music,

118
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,680
you'll understand.

119
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,940
When did you come back?

120
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,270
Why didn't you tell me?

121
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,480
I really need to thank you for today.

122
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,950
If you hadn't come back,

123
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,740
I wouldn't have known how to handle the situation.

124
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,510
And you appeared just at the right moment.

125
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,890
That wasn't a coincidence.

126
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:18,750

218
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,900
Ziyin, we should enter now.

219
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:28,370
Cheng Ziyin? Why is she here too?

220
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,580
Wasn't it said that no one dared to invite her anymore?

221
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,130
Bad publicity is still publicity.

222
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:34,380
Maybe she just wanted to stir up some buzz.

223
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,539
You're all here.

224
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:36,770
It's been a while, right?

225
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:38,570
Yes, it's been so long,

226
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:40,720
and you've secretly prepared something big.

227
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,590
You really shocked us this time.

228
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:44,010
Ning,

229
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,900
I've stocked a few boxes at home of that face mask

230
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,480
you mentioned was really good.

231
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,830
When are you going to get them?

232
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:50,920
Girls, let's go inside.

233
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,670
All of you used to

234
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:00,350
shamelessly beg me to help you get on camera,

235
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:01,860
and now what?

236
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:04,830
Fine, but this is not over.

237
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:07,650
One day, you'll all be kneeling to apologize to me.

238
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,330
Sorry, miss.

239
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,430
You cannot enter.

240
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,740
Why can't I?

241
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,960
You are not on our invitation list.

242
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:17,810
Look carefully.

243
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:19,090
I have an invitation.

244
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,020
I'm really sorry, miss.

245
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,870
Please stand aside

246
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,490
and don't block the entrance for our other guests.
