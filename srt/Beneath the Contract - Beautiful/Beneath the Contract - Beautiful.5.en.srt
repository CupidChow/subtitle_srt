1
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:44,960
Su,

2
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:46,350
are you done shopping?

3
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:47,110
I'll pick you up.

4
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:47,960
No need.

5
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:49,790
I'm heading back now.

6
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:50,880
By the way,

7
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,480
find someone to keep an eye on Ruan Xinjian now.

8
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,200
He's harassing you again?

9
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,560
Yeah, but I didn't let him get away with it.

10
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,710
But knowing his personality,

11
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,430
he's definitely going to stir up trouble tonight.

12
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:02,030
Get someone on him now.

13
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,760
You must have something on him.

14
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,570
Okay, I'll do it right away.

15
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:06,350
Wait.

16
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:08,480
I saw him.

17
00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:10,150
I'll send you the address.

18
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:11,680
I'm gonna follow him first.

19
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,420
Be careful.

20
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,430
Let her go!

21
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,039
Why are you everywhere?

22
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,200
How dare you harass girls out here now?

23
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,000
Harassing?

24
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:26,510
We were just saying

25
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:28,230
we wanted to buy her a drink, weren't we?

26
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:29,000
Yes.

27
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,789
We offered to treat her.

28
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:31,950
Fine.

29
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,840
Since you're here,

30
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:35,400
let's all drink together.

31
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,330
Sure, let's invite them together.

32
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,710
Miss, what's wrong?

33
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:43,950
They followed us

34
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,550
and even want to bully us.

35
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,430
Do you want to try messing with a former martial arts champion?

36
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:50,400
This is a society restricted by law, right?

37
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,400
Look, we said we want to treat them.

38
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,360
Treat, right?

39
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,509
Let's go.

40
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:55,200
Stop!

41
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,870
Stop!

42
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,280
Stop!

43
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,310
Stop!

44
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:28,910
Mr. Bo,

45
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,630
we got a report from the person

46
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:32,870
you sent to watch over Ms. Ruan.

47
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,680
He said that Ms. Ruan rescued a girl

48
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,680
from the thugs.

49
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,560
According to our investigation,

50
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,690
the thugs were led by her stepbrother.

51
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,120
But

52
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,590
something happened to her stepbrother.

53
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,990
He's in the hospital now.

54
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:46,560
Got it.

55
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,590
Go back.

56
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,520
Okay, Mr. Bo.

57
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,000
Rest early.

58
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,760
The patient suffered a severe impact.

59
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,750
Judging from the current situation,

60
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,520
the nervous system is completely damaged

61
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,710
and can't regenerate.

62
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:59,640
What do you mean?

63
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,310
Simply put,

64
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:03,040
paralysis from the waist down.

65
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,430
He'll most likely be in a wheelchair

66
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,710
for the rest of his life.

67
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,570
You need to be mentally prepared.

68
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,470
Is there really no way

69
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,240
for him to stand up again?

70
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,590
It's unlikely

71
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,950
he'll ever walk normally again.

72
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,560
No.

73
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,430
It's impossible, doctor.

74
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:22,190
Look, I can still move. Look.

75
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,800
I suggest adding a brain CT scan.

76
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:26,520
Doctor.

77
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,150
Wait, look.

78
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,240
Doctor.

79
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,310
Doctor!

80
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,240
Mom!

81
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,800
Shut up!

82
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,360
Useless!

83
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,710
What exactly happened?

84
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,110
It's all Ruan Su's fault.

85
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,310
She brought a bunch of people to chase me,

86
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,030
and I got into a car accident trying to get away.

87
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,490
You have to avenge me, Mom.

88
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,430
Oh, by the way,

89
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:46,120
I need you to clean something up for me.

90
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,780
You have to delete surveillance footage for me.

91
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:49,800
What do you mean?

92
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,280
I drank too much that day.

93
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,710
I almost did something to a girl...

94
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,360
You...

95
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,680
I...

96
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,520
I'm already like this, and you still hit me?

97
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,590
Fight with me?

98
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,840
I'd like to see who's more ruthless.

99
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,560
Li Meixing!

100
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,150
I advise you not to even think about it.

101
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,010
Anyone who wants to bully my woman

102
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,470
better ask for my permission first.

103
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,000
Isn't this Mr. Bo?

104
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,140
Are you two getting a divorce?

105
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,680
She's my daughter.

106
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,800
How I treat her

107
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,830
is none of your business.

108
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,390
You can try it.

109
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:27,680
See

110
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:30,720
if I will spare you.

111
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,510
Hello? Who is it?

112
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,070
This is the Zhonglu Branch of the Jianghai District Police Department.

113
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:46,270
Are you Ruan Xinjian?

114
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,240
Hello, officer.

115
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,510
We've just received a report.

116
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:52,270
You're suspected of attempted rape.

117
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,120
Please come to the police station for investigation.

118
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,270
No, no, officer.

119
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,360
I'm in the hospital now.

120
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,190
I can't go.

121
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,940
Then we'll come to you.

122
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,190
Ruan Su, wait and see.

123
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:14,160
Ruan Su, don't think you can do whatever you want

124
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,240
just because you have someone backing you.

125
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,270
Back?

126
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,780
I don't need it.

127
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,560
I didn't expect you to be so good at pretending.

128
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,680
Wasn't it you who begged Mr. Bo

129
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,340
to come show off in front of me?

130
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:28,240
Let me tell you, even if someone is supporting you,

131
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:31,160
I can still make you get down on your knees and beg,

132
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,560
just like you did when you were a kid.

133
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,630
Li Meixing,

134
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,750
what you've been through

135
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,000
is your retribution.

136
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,600
Don't blame it on me.

137
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,800
You'd better behave yourself.

138
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:46,360
You clearly weren't raised right.

139
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,200
So rude and uncivilized.

140
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,180
Let's wait and see.

141
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,480
Why do Bo Xingzhi

142
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:58,480
always meddle in others' business?

143
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,240
Bo Group?

144
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:21,870
Su.

145
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,190
Hello, Xinyu.

146
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,830
You can consider working with Bo Group.

147
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,360
Why did you change your mind all of a sudden?

148
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,750
After weighing everything,

149
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,630
Bo Group still fits our team's needs best.

150
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,600
And

151
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,120
I don't want to owe him a favor.

152
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,560
Fine.

153
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,600
I'll inform them later.

154
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,560
But such constant back-and-forth

155
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,890
can really take a toll on

156
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,390
his emotional state.

157
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:48,920
Mr. Bo,

158
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,270
we just got word that

159
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:51,600
Hengjiu Tech Group

160
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,060
has agreed to meet with us.

161
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:56,630
They said we can talk more about the collaboration later.

162
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,560
Got it.

163
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,830
Look into why they suddenly changed their mind

164
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:02,230
and let me know once the meeting time is set.

165
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,160
Yes.

166
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,560
This is the Junling Mountain,

167
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,360
and over there is the Taizi Dam.

168
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,800
We're developing clean energy projects

169
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,830
using barren land,

170
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,490
with photovoltaic power generation underway.

171
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:16,600
Have the employees left for the site inspection yet?

172
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,390
Not yet.

173
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,230
The driver will leave in an hour.

174
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,680
They don't have to go.

175
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,630
I'll go myself.

176
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,750
Let them do these things.

177
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,280
Don't you still have...

178
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,270
Something happened to Ruan Xinjian recently.

179
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:30,070
They should be quiet for a while.

180
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,870
Consider it as me taking a break.

181
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:32,800
I'll go with you.

182
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,720
Xinyu, you'd better stay in the company.

183
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,120
That way, I'll be at ease.

184
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,480
My identity is not exposed yet,

185
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,880
so it's actually convenient for me to conduct the site visit.

186
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,390
Have you set the specific time for the field inspection this afternoon?

187
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,390
Yes.

188
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:49,270
Here are the personal profiles of the employees for the visit.

189
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:51,360
I don't need to check it myself.

190
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,320
By the way,

191
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,870
the terrain is steep this afternoon,

192
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,040
and there's a risk of danger at any moment.

193
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,040
Remember to report to me regularly.

194
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:00,680
Alright, Mr. Bo.

195
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,800
Let's take a rest here.

196
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,480
Where exactly is this place?

197
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,870
My company sent just me.

198
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,330
Why did your company send only you as well?

199
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:33,390
It's pitch black here,

200
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,270
and there's no signal on my phone.

201
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,580
What are we going to do?

202
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,240
How about we climb up to the top of the mountain?

203
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,570
Maybe there's a signal.

204
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,030
Alright,

205
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:44,320
let's go.

206
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,870
Be careful.

207
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,380
Be careful.

208
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,440
Careful with the rocks underfoot.

209
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:55,960
Watch out!
