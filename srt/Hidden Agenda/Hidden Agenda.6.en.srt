1
00:00:00,091 --> 00:00:02,353
I’m sorry. I will try not to shut you out.

2
00:00:02,353 --> 00:00:03,909
Even if he's not clear with you,

3
00:00:03,909 --> 00:00:05,909
you can be clear with him.

4
00:00:05,909 --> 00:00:09,258
Someone here told me that the sun makes people happy.

5
00:00:09,258 --> 00:00:10,704
So I just wanted to spread the joy.

6
00:00:11,373 --> 00:00:12,473
Let me eat it instead.

7
00:00:12,473 --> 00:00:13,687
Why did you eat that stink bean for me?

8
00:00:13,687 --> 00:00:14,720
It's no big deal.

9
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,876
But it's different this time.

10
00:00:16,876 --> 00:00:18,838
My feelings are involved.

11
00:00:18,838 --> 00:00:21,025
I’m so confused about my own feelings.

12
00:00:21,025 --> 00:00:22,585
Is it because I like you?

13
00:00:22,885 --> 00:00:23,881
I like you, Zo.

14
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,987
I’ll make you see that I really like you.

15
00:00:27,887 --> 00:00:29,127
Let me win you over, Zo.

16
00:00:43,441 --> 00:00:44,262
Joke.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,899
Morning!

18
00:00:58,676 --> 00:01:00,676
Today, I'm your personal chef.

19
00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:06,419
Let's have breakfast and then head to campus togther.

20
00:01:07,158 --> 00:01:08,896
Seriously, why all this effort?

21
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:15,553
You’ll see when you learn the meaning of this flower I got you.

22
00:01:26,232 --> 00:01:27,469
Are you feeling alright?

23
00:01:29,277 --> 00:01:30,564
You look a bit off.

24
00:01:31,344 --> 00:01:32,200
Do I?

25
00:01:48,705 --> 00:01:49,729
You’re not burning up or anything.

26
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:54,960
I’m fine now. I had a little stomach thing yesterday.

27
00:01:55,425 --> 00:01:56,479
But I’m allgood now.

28
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:57,189
Glad to hear that.

29
00:01:58,291 --> 00:02:00,301
Let me plate this.

30
00:02:01,192 --> 00:02:02,280
You go get ready.

31
00:02:10,237 --> 00:02:11,923
Come on, we don’t want to be late!

32
00:02:38,469 --> 00:02:40,469
[What does a sunflower mean?]

33
00:02:45,492 --> 00:02:47,492
[Sunflower: liveliness sprung from despair]

34
00:02:47,607 --> 00:02:49,135
[There may be an equation to a relationship. But romantic feelings are involved, it gets complicated.]

35
00:03:57,513 --> 00:03:58,286
Guys,

36
00:04:01,431 --> 00:04:02,658
I have something to tell you.

37
00:04:07,112 --> 00:04:08,667
Joke is trying to win me over.

38
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:09,450
Huh?

39
00:04:09,961 --> 00:04:11,018
That guy?

40
00:04:11,841 --> 00:04:13,029
Joke is trying to win you over?

41
00:04:14,169 --> 00:04:16,040
How did you react?

42
00:04:17,249 --> 00:04:18,908
I don't have a clue.

43
00:04:19,616 --> 00:04:21,459
I don't know how to respond,

44
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:23,120
or how to act.

45
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:26,144
I'm still in shock.

46
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:29,840
If you’re not into him, just be straight.

47
00:04:30,114 --> 00:04:32,586
Tell him you're not interested, that's all.

48
00:04:33,232 --> 00:04:38,280
Kot, let him figure it out. It's his call.

49
00:04:42,097 --> 00:04:44,000
You guys don’t seem all that surprised

50
00:04:45,573 --> 00:04:46,630
especially you!

51
00:04:47,893 --> 00:04:51,046
Come on, Zo! Of course, I’m surprised.

52
00:04:51,046 --> 00:04:53,533
Who would have thought that Joke had feelings for you?

53
00:04:57,092 --> 00:04:58,231
Well, how do you feel about it?

54
00:05:02,972 --> 00:05:04,121
I’m not sure.

55
00:05:11,162 --> 00:05:12,376
But he’s not too bad.

56
00:05:17,413 --> 00:05:19,520
Your feelings matter most right now.

57
00:05:20,158 --> 00:05:22,158
Prioritize your feelings.

58
00:05:22,891 --> 00:05:25,730
Look after yourself, not just everyone else.

59
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,389
Yes, I agree with him.

60
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:35,307
Do what feels right.

61
00:05:35,307 --> 00:05:38,091
We’ve got your back either way.

62
00:06:11,564 --> 00:06:20,901
[Joke: How will you get to the club in this rain?]

63
00:06:22,446 --> 00:06:25,180
[Zo: Guess I’ll wait it out and catch the shuttle.]

64
00:06:25,939 --> 00:06:33,652
[Joke: Hop in with me? I’ll swing by.]

65
00:06:34,422 --> 00:06:36,422
[Zo: Okay.]

66
00:07:08,986 --> 00:07:09,637
Zo!

67
00:07:16,189 --> 00:07:17,112
Why didn't you wait?

68
00:07:18,579 --> 00:07:19,787
I said I'd come get you.

69
00:07:23,862 --> 00:07:25,116
I didn’t see a reply,

70
00:07:26,374 --> 00:07:27,461
so I thought…

71
00:07:27,461 --> 00:07:29,226
What if you catch a cold?

72
00:07:32,397 --> 00:07:33,978
I’m tougher than that.

73
00:07:34,822 --> 00:07:36,481
You’d better be.

74
00:07:42,926 --> 00:07:45,450
Let's head out before it gets worse.

75
00:07:49,515 --> 00:07:53,559
I'll take care of you if you get sick.

76
00:07:54,581 --> 00:07:55,449
ok?

77
00:07:59,763 --> 00:08:00,479
Let’s go.

78
00:08:02,486 --> 00:08:03,464
Get under the umbrella.

79
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,460
Aren’t you going to get wet? That’s a small umbrella.

80
00:08:23,316 --> 00:08:25,211
So, what's on the agenda for today's meeting?

81
00:08:27,523 --> 00:08:29,366
You didn’t hear a word, did you?

82
00:08:29,518 --> 00:08:31,413
Wave and I talked about this yesterday.

83
00:08:34,091 --> 00:08:36,720
It’s light stuff

84
00:08:36,904 --> 00:08:41,120
just hashing out the debate topic.

85
00:08:52,854 --> 00:08:54,854
[Wave: Mind if we call off the meeting?]

86
00:08:54,854 --> 00:08:56,608
[Wave: I got something personal to sort out. Apologies!]

87
00:08:56,608 --> 00:08:57,366
Hey,

88
00:08:58,524 --> 00:08:59,636
looks like the meeting is off.

89
00:08:59,767 --> 00:09:00,655
What?

90
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:05,476
[Nita: I was about to sit this one out.]

91
00:09:05,843 --> 00:09:07,843
[Nita: I'm feeling a bit under the weather, so I wasn’t going to join. Take care, everyone.]

92
00:09:08,412 --> 00:09:10,412
[Pok: Duly noted.]

93
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,081
Ugh!

94
00:09:14,466 --> 00:09:16,149
I came here for nothing.

95
00:09:27,309 --> 00:09:28,166
What are you doing?

96
00:09:30,105 --> 00:09:33,685
Just going over some notes so I’ll nail my speech.

97
00:09:36,931 --> 00:09:41,971
No meeting now, so how about some fun?

98
00:09:46,596 --> 00:09:47,570
What are you doing?

99
00:09:47,937 --> 00:09:48,649
Let’s move.

100
00:09:49,377 --> 00:09:51,720
No, I really should get through read the notes.

101
00:09:52,349 --> 00:09:55,712
Come on, man. Free time is for going out and having fun.

102
00:09:55,712 --> 00:09:58,665
Free time is for reading. I don’t have enough time as it is.

103
00:09:59,175 --> 00:10:01,463
Come on, man.

104
00:10:01,463 --> 00:10:02,674
What’s the matter with you?

105
00:10:02,674 --> 00:10:05,258
Here you go.

106
00:10:06,783 --> 00:10:08,311
Let’s move!

107
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,875
Man, it's been ages since I've been to a place like this. It's changed so much.

108
00:10:24,238 --> 00:10:25,908
Ages? How long are we talking?

109
00:10:27,281 --> 00:10:29,185
I haven’t been to an arcade

110
00:10:32,015 --> 00:10:33,390
since I was in third grade.

111
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,829
Seriously, third grade?

112
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:38,432
What did you do as a kid?

113
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:44,640
I stayed home, did homework, and went to tutoring classes.

114
00:10:45,884 --> 00:10:46,829
I see.

115
00:10:48,061 --> 00:10:50,520
Today's the day we bring back those lost childhood moments.

116
00:10:51,761 --> 00:10:56,539
I guess you can never be too old for a good game.

117
00:10:57,159 --> 00:11:00,129
Let’s just say that we’ll do something fun today.

118
00:11:00,796 --> 00:11:01,597
I’m in.

119
00:11:04,532 --> 00:11:06,308
I’ll beat you in every game.

120
00:11:09,185 --> 00:11:10,515
If you do,

121
00:11:12,742 --> 00:11:13,910
there’s a reward.

122
00:11:16,044 --> 00:11:20,324
For five wins in a row, you’ll get an exclusive t-shirt.

123
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:23,504
Forget the t-shirt.

124
00:11:29,078 --> 00:11:30,711
How about you open up your heart to me?

125
00:11:41,529 --> 00:11:42,583
You’re not making much sense.

126
00:11:43,343 --> 00:11:50,238
Whatever, I won’t allow any different opinions or rebuttals on this topic.

127
00:11:58,363 --> 00:12:00,701
Ten wins

128
00:12:02,902 --> 00:12:03,866
and we can talk.

129
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:07,387
Is that a deal?

130
00:12:08,697 --> 00:12:09,640
Deal!

131
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:35,470
I was just giving you a head start.

132
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:36,841
Are you saying I didn’t earn that win?

133
00:12:40,242 --> 00:12:42,242
That zombie just came out of nowhere!

134
00:12:44,793 --> 00:12:46,360
I thought you weren’t scared of zombies.

135
00:12:47,757 --> 00:12:49,207
Help me, Zo!

136
00:12:49,342 --> 00:12:51,342
Relax! Relax!

137
00:12:54,393 --> 00:12:55,360
You’re dead.

138
00:12:56,749 --> 00:12:58,680
Thought you weren’t afraid of zombies.

139
00:13:10,097 --> 00:13:11,232
Are you cheating?

140
00:13:14,134 --> 00:13:15,165
Watch out!

141
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:17,811
I have to block this!

142
00:13:18,283 --> 00:13:20,283
Getting a bit out of hand.

143
00:13:24,138 --> 00:13:25,299
That was close.

144
00:13:42,086 --> 00:13:43,431
Why are you so fast?

145
00:13:51,504 --> 00:13:52,954
I’m standing up now.

146
00:13:59,961 --> 00:14:01,516
How’s that?

147
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,223
I beat you!

148
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:32,371
Here’s your prize.

149
00:14:41,122 --> 00:14:42,021
That’s a cool T-shirt.

150
00:14:46,354 --> 00:14:48,144
Can you pack it up, please?

151
00:14:52,669 --> 00:14:54,669
Aren't you happy about the win?

152
00:14:58,281 --> 00:15:01,565
Even she seemed happy for you.

153
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:04,902
I am,

154
00:15:05,636 --> 00:15:06,467
but

155
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,960
I couldn’t hold up my end of the deal.

156
00:15:18,286 --> 00:15:19,038
Thank you.

157
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,198
It’s alright.

158
00:15:21,862 --> 00:15:23,862
You won the T-shirt!

159
00:15:25,934 --> 00:15:26,964
Next time then.

160
00:15:31,874 --> 00:15:33,507
I won’t hold back next time.

161
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:51,637
No smelly veggies, not too spicy, just chili paste.

162
00:15:52,956 --> 00:15:53,685
Eat up.

163
00:15:55,352 --> 00:15:56,623
But it…

164
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:57,350
Trust me.

165
00:15:57,885 --> 00:16:00,242
The food at that stall is delicious.

166
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:04,244
But I don’t really like her food.

167
00:16:04,514 --> 00:16:05,379
Come on, man.

168
00:16:06,117 --> 00:16:08,443
I waited in line for this.

169
00:16:08,841 --> 00:16:09,814
Just give it a try.

170
00:16:11,987 --> 00:16:12,910
Thank you,

171
00:16:14,768 --> 00:16:17,884
but I might just grab something else.

172
00:16:18,025 --> 00:16:18,868
Zo,

173
00:16:19,368 --> 00:16:20,906
I already ordered this for you.

174
00:16:21,452 --> 00:16:22,964
You can’t waste this.

175
00:16:22,964 --> 00:16:23,832
Hey!

176
00:16:23,832 --> 00:16:24,915
Kot, chill out, man!

177
00:16:25,044 --> 00:16:26,687
Why are you forcing stuff on Zo?

178
00:16:27,299 --> 00:16:29,299
If he doesn't want to eat it, drop it.

179
00:16:29,648 --> 00:16:31,648
I'm talking to Zo, not you.

180
00:16:33,214 --> 00:16:36,190
This is why I have issues with you hanging around Zo.

181
00:16:36,405 --> 00:16:37,437
What’s your problem?

182
00:16:37,884 --> 00:16:39,284
Don’t fight!

183
00:16:39,284 --> 00:16:40,717
Calm down, guys.

184
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:42,386
Zo,

185
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:44,809
you can’t let him boss you around like this.

186
00:16:44,924 --> 00:16:46,604
I've been your buddy forever,

187
00:16:46,604 --> 00:16:48,470
and I've never once treated you like this.

188
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:50,522
He’s not bossing me around.

189
00:16:50,522 --> 00:16:53,379
Kot, don’t overthink it. This is nothing.

190
00:16:55,175 --> 00:16:55,992
Joke,

191
00:16:57,373 --> 00:16:59,056
just back off a bit, okay?

192
00:17:02,599 --> 00:17:03,932
I was only talking to you,

193
00:17:04,861 --> 00:17:05,924
but your friend…

194
00:17:06,967 --> 00:17:08,467
Bastard! You want a piece of me?

195
00:17:08,467 --> 00:17:09,045
Cool it down!

196
00:17:09,045 --> 00:17:10,151
That’s enough.

197
00:17:11,204 --> 00:17:12,092
Enough.

198
00:17:12,092 --> 00:17:14,347
Sit down, man.

199
00:17:16,157 --> 00:17:16,938
Come with me.

200
00:17:23,449 --> 00:17:24,347
Cool it, dude.

201
00:17:24,823 --> 00:17:25,925
Did you see his attitude?

202
00:17:25,925 --> 00:17:27,252
Yeah, I did.

203
00:17:36,533 --> 00:17:37,604
You need to chill out.

204
00:17:38,914 --> 00:17:41,867
Do you think it's right to pick a fight with Kot like that?

205
00:17:43,137 --> 00:17:44,113
But I wasn't wrong.

206
00:17:45,602 --> 00:17:47,673
You can act however you want around me,

207
00:17:49,592 --> 00:17:50,806
but not with others.

208
00:17:53,765 --> 00:17:56,132
You can do whatever you want,

209
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:59,244
but respect boundaries.

210
00:18:03,895 --> 00:18:08,753
As for the food, I know you meant well.

211
00:18:09,275 --> 00:18:10,703
You wanted me to try something new.

212
00:18:13,241 --> 00:18:16,360
But you need to understand that I don't like it.

213
00:18:17,927 --> 00:18:20,284
People don't do things they don't like.

214
00:18:21,855 --> 00:18:23,101
They can try,

215
00:18:24,601 --> 00:18:25,766
but it won’t last.

216
00:18:27,624 --> 00:18:28,588
You get me?

217
00:18:32,803 --> 00:18:33,785
I do.

218
00:18:34,627 --> 00:18:36,770
But you know that I want what’s best for you, right?

219
00:18:38,001 --> 00:18:39,620
I do.

220
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:43,157
But everyone needs space.

221
00:18:45,604 --> 00:18:48,461
Whether we’re friends or something else,

222
00:18:49,245 --> 00:18:52,388
it’s always good to communicate when something upsets you.

223
00:18:58,462 --> 00:19:02,079
I know that you’re in a bad mood.

224
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:05,778
You’re not ready to listen.

225
00:19:07,778 --> 00:19:12,415
Take some time to cool down.

226
00:19:14,676 --> 00:19:17,343
I believe you’ll get what I’m trying to say.

227
00:19:21,769 --> 00:19:22,816
Don’t stress about it.

228
00:19:34,453 --> 00:19:38,096
I need each of you to brainstorm two potential debate topics

229
00:19:38,204 --> 00:19:40,204
for next week when we don't have club sessions.

230
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,533
Just so you're all aware,

231
00:19:45,204 --> 00:19:48,657
we're hosting the Political Science open house next week.

232
00:19:48,845 --> 00:19:53,679
Zo, Pok, and Nita will be with me at the booth

233
00:19:54,256 --> 00:19:56,256
Zo, you’re doing the open house?

234
00:19:56,758 --> 00:19:57,677
Let me help.

235
00:19:58,582 --> 00:19:59,293
Joke,

236
00:20:01,103 --> 00:20:02,450
if you have a question, just ask.

237
00:20:04,894 --> 00:20:06,394
I already asked Zo.

238
00:20:08,836 --> 00:20:10,336
You listen when someone else is speaking.

239
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,020
Talking over someone else’s speech is just rude.

240
00:20:16,723 --> 00:20:17,755
I’m sorry.

241
00:20:21,827 --> 00:20:23,367
This is your assignment.

242
00:20:23,861 --> 00:20:25,861
Let’s talk before our practice week.

243
00:20:25,861 --> 00:20:26,661
Dismissed.

244
00:20:28,841 --> 00:20:32,889
Wave, may I talk to you about something?

245
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:44,675
Joke,

246
00:20:46,842 --> 00:20:47,967
can you help me with something?

247
00:21:15,018 --> 00:21:15,970
What the hell?

248
00:21:20,585 --> 00:21:22,585
[Love you.]
[Can I hold your hand?]

249
00:21:30,234 --> 00:21:31,996
I found these all over my car.

250
00:21:33,809 --> 00:21:34,728
It’s freaking me out.

251
00:21:35,228 --> 00:21:36,428
You need to be careful.

252
00:21:38,394 --> 00:21:41,608
What if he comes back?

253
00:21:48,409 --> 00:21:49,647
Don't be afraid.

254
00:21:53,088 --> 00:21:53,881
Don't worry.

255
00:21:54,976 --> 00:21:57,255
Let me know when something like this happens again.?

256
00:22:15,139 --> 00:22:17,139
Call me if anything happens, okay?

257
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:18,887
Thanks.

258
00:22:22,316 --> 00:22:23,066
Zo,

259
00:22:26,353 --> 00:22:27,186
have you eaten?

260
00:22:34,881 --> 00:22:35,727
I'm not that hungry.

261
00:22:37,585 --> 00:22:40,263
I’ve gotta head out. Bye.

262
00:23:01,328 --> 00:23:02,852
Zo, let me give you a ride.

263
00:23:05,746 --> 00:23:06,432
Zo!

264
00:23:07,623 --> 00:23:08,365
Zo!

265
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:13,355
What’s the matter?

266
00:23:16,165 --> 00:23:17,101
Nothing.

267
00:23:18,878 --> 00:23:21,545
Come on, your face gives you away.

268
00:23:25,427 --> 00:23:26,920
If I ask you about Nita…

269
00:23:29,897 --> 00:23:31,118
I…

270
00:23:31,691 --> 00:23:33,203
Oh,

271
00:23:35,061 --> 00:23:36,347
when I was talking to her just now?

272
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:39,095
I’ve gotta ask.

273
00:23:39,775 --> 00:23:41,537
Why were you and Nita acting like you’re a couple?

274
00:23:45,392 --> 00:23:46,558
You wanna know why?

275
00:24:04,244 --> 00:24:06,244
[I’m always close, Nita.]
[I’m coming for you, my Nita.]

276
00:24:06,619 --> 00:24:08,619
[Love you, Nita.]
[Have you eaten, Nita.]

277
00:24:09,844 --> 00:24:11,844
[Be my girl, Nita.]
[I’m always watching you.]

278
00:24:43,277 --> 00:24:44,220
Who the hell are you?

279
00:24:46,316 --> 00:24:47,992
Your secret admirer.

280
00:24:50,059 --> 00:24:51,231
Be my girlfriend.

281
00:24:51,779 --> 00:24:54,512
You’re crazy! I don’t even know you.

282
00:24:56,295 --> 00:24:57,981
But I love you so much.

283
00:24:57,981 --> 00:24:58,890
Be mine.

284
00:24:59,126 --> 00:24:59,736
No!

285
00:25:00,331 --> 00:25:01,721
I didn't know you liked it rough.

286
00:25:04,924 --> 00:25:07,567
Get away from me!

287
00:25:08,402 --> 00:25:10,402
Get your hands off my girlfriend!

288
00:25:14,687 --> 00:25:15,650
Who are you?

289
00:25:16,484 --> 00:25:18,878
I'm her boyfriend. Who are you?

290
00:25:20,095 --> 00:25:21,151
That's not possible.

291
00:25:21,794 --> 00:25:23,190
I've been watching her.

292
00:25:23,795 --> 00:25:24,874
Nita doesn't have a boyfriend.

293
00:25:26,208 --> 00:25:28,939
So, you’re the creepy stalker.

294
00:25:31,027 --> 00:25:33,360
No, I’m going to be her boyfriend.

295
00:25:36,585 --> 00:25:38,005
I’m her boyfriend.

296
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:40,703
Get that into your thick skull.

297
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:43,488
If you so much as come near her,

298
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:46,609
I’ll beat you senseless.

299
00:25:48,609 --> 00:25:49,488
Go!

300
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,015
Are you okay?

301
00:26:02,659 --> 00:26:03,664
I’m so scared.

302
00:26:06,512 --> 00:26:10,060
The bastard hasn’t shown his face since.

303
00:26:11,305 --> 00:26:12,710
He’s never bothered Nita again.

304
00:26:13,651 --> 00:26:16,675
I'm not surprised. You went all out on him.

305
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:19,132
I wouldn't show my face either.

306
00:26:20,221 --> 00:26:24,936
After that, rumors about Nita and me started.

307
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,150
I didn't bother clearing them.

308
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:28,964
I left it at that.

309
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:33,135
Even I bought into that story..

310
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:39,641
Leaving it as is was a good move.

311
00:26:41,037 --> 00:26:43,037
Otherwise, you might not have approached me.

312
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:53,562
I came to you for advice on winning Nita over.

313
00:26:54,702 --> 00:26:56,035
I saw right through you.

314
00:26:57,988 --> 00:27:01,441
You didn't really want Nita.

315
00:27:04,245 --> 00:27:09,244
If you did, you wouldn't have suppressed your feelings.

316
00:27:11,442 --> 00:27:16,395
Kinda like how I can't hide my feelings for you.

317
00:27:23,467 --> 00:27:27,708
So, how about us?

318
00:27:36,305 --> 00:27:37,541
I'm not rushing you.

319
00:27:38,814 --> 00:27:39,764
Take your time.

320
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:43,886
I know you're still confused about a lot of things.

321
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,053
I'll always wait for you.

322
00:27:56,108 --> 00:28:00,132
I need to sort out my feelings.

323
00:28:05,825 --> 00:28:06,968
Take all the time you need.

324
00:28:09,078 --> 00:28:10,040
Shall we head out?

325
00:28:13,017 --> 00:28:13,674
Come on.

326
00:28:26,889 --> 00:28:28,088
What are your ideas, guys?

327
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,550
How about a debate format?

328
00:28:58,545 --> 00:28:59,447
Okay.

329
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,168
Let me help.

330
00:29:09,546 --> 00:29:10,423
Thanks.

331
00:29:10,484 --> 00:29:12,484
Gotta rush to class. Catch you later.

332
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:25,699
Not so hard, is it?

333
00:29:45,724 --> 00:29:47,083
Greenlight all the way.

334
00:30:17,437 --> 00:30:18,888
Need any help with that?

335
00:30:19,784 --> 00:30:22,860
I'm good. This is a piece of cake. I'll be done soon.

336
00:30:41,153 --> 00:30:42,718
What's with the stare?

337
00:30:46,498 --> 00:30:49,734
Nita, I’m sorry. I didn’t realize.

338
00:31:00,102 --> 00:31:01,827
Anything you want to ask?

339
00:31:05,218 --> 00:31:08,004
Why would you ask me that?

340
00:31:10,522 --> 00:31:15,772
I can feel that you’ve been looking at me and Joke funny

341
00:31:15,856 --> 00:31:17,364
since the parking lot incident.

342
00:31:18,294 --> 00:31:23,613
And you haven't been looking at me the same way.

343
00:31:25,515 --> 00:31:30,924
If there is anything you want to ask or tell me, just say it.

344
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:33,009
It might make you feel better.

345
00:31:34,407 --> 00:31:38,307
If there's nothing, that's fine too. It may just be all in my head.

346
00:31:38,498 --> 00:31:39,903
I may be just overthinking.

347
00:31:43,472 --> 00:31:44,288
Nita.

348
00:31:45,798 --> 00:31:46,501
Hmm?

349
00:31:50,189 --> 00:31:51,006
Well,

350
00:31:57,437 --> 00:31:58,757
I had feelings for you.

351
00:32:05,285 --> 00:32:09,825
I had a hunch but wasn’t sure.

352
00:32:11,856 --> 00:32:14,680
Why only tell me now?

353
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:22,320
I liked you a lot.

354
00:32:23,144 --> 00:32:31,575
I even daydreamed about us as a couple.

355
00:32:34,371 --> 00:32:35,753
Got any answer?

356
00:32:39,668 --> 00:32:46,818
Remember the Greek mythology story about the sunflower I shared?

357
00:32:48,843 --> 00:32:49,733
I do.

358
00:32:51,976 --> 00:32:59,632
I’ve come to realize that the sunflower means more than just sitting around and waiting.

359
00:33:04,183 --> 00:33:12,935
Having a crush on you is similar to admiring someone.

360
00:33:14,852 --> 00:33:22,345
You’re so talented. You’re like an idol to me.

361
00:33:24,128 --> 00:33:27,318
So, your feelings stem from my abilities?

362
00:33:30,348 --> 00:33:30,987
Sorry.

363
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:35,667
You don’t need to be sorry.

364
00:33:37,458 --> 00:33:39,458
In fact, I should thank you.

365
00:33:40,672 --> 00:33:46,563
Thank you for the feelings you had for me, even if they were just admiration.

366
00:33:46,955 --> 00:33:50,191
I’m so happy you told me.

367
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:56,725
Saying 'I used to admire you' isn't right.

368
00:33:57,269 --> 00:34:03,500
I still do because you’re so great.

369
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:05,924
Not just for your academic performance,

370
00:34:07,367 --> 00:34:13,624
but also the way you converse, think, and see the world.

371
00:34:14,415 --> 00:34:19,665
You’re too kind. Thank you.

372
00:34:22,409 --> 00:34:31,412
You mentioned the sunflower meant more than just sitting and waiting?

373
00:34:33,412 --> 00:34:34,318
That?

374
00:34:36,765 --> 00:34:44,702
Someone once said if I discovered the meaning of the sunflower they gifted me,

375
00:34:46,467 --> 00:34:47,652
I'd understand it all.

376
00:34:52,358 --> 00:34:58,254
It's about steadiness, patience, loyalty,

377
00:34:59,943 --> 00:35:06,406
and, most importantly, a commitment to always be there.

378
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,641
That’s so sweet.

379
00:35:12,238 --> 00:35:15,924
That person must be a hopeless romantic.

380
00:35:16,911 --> 00:35:21,749
So, the sunflower doesn't need to wait for the sun anymore.

381
00:35:22,732 --> 00:35:26,655
Making someone wait endlessly is cruel.

382
00:35:29,414 --> 00:35:33,062
Don't let the sunflower wait and wither away.

383
00:35:58,064 --> 00:35:58,948
Here’s your drink.

384
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:03,486
Thank you.

385
00:36:06,525 --> 00:36:09,166
I'd be so lost without you.

386
00:36:11,024 --> 00:36:11,997
You're welcome.

387
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:14,963
Need anything else?

388
00:36:15,627 --> 00:36:16,505
I’ll get it for you”krub”.

389
00:36:18,317 --> 00:36:20,454
Why are you so polite?

390
00:36:23,667 --> 00:36:24,644
Did I say something wrong?

391
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:26,886
Nothing.

392
00:36:28,259 --> 00:36:36,080
I’ve been so laser-focused on this project.

393
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:39,592
Sorry.

394
00:36:41,629 --> 00:36:42,411
That’s alright.

395
00:36:43,884 --> 00:36:45,685
You’ve been working too hard.

396
00:36:46,646 --> 00:36:49,706
Who else would look out for you if not me?

397
00:37:12,344 --> 00:37:15,924
Thank you for taking such good care of me.

398
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:23,282
And while I appreciate your politeness,

399
00:37:28,331 --> 00:37:29,873
just be yourself.

400
00:37:32,218 --> 00:37:34,928
Being you is more than enough.

401
00:37:39,267 --> 00:37:39,972
Well,

402
00:37:41,483 --> 00:37:43,510
if I kept at it, it’d become my second nature.

403
00:37:46,063 --> 00:37:48,795
I’m trying to be better for myself

404
00:37:50,654 --> 00:37:51,749
and for you.

405
00:37:53,008 --> 00:37:54,180
You said you wanted to win me over.

406
00:37:58,277 --> 00:37:59,486
You weren't just pulling my leg, were you?

407
00:38:01,294 --> 00:38:02,322
Why bring that up now?

408
00:38:04,885 --> 00:38:10,528
Just want to know if you’re serious or not.

409
00:38:18,089 --> 00:38:19,015
Trust me, I am.

410
00:38:21,395 --> 00:38:25,390
From now on, no more playing the part of someone else

411
00:38:27,976 --> 00:38:29,800
or helping you chase after someone else, Zo.

412
00:38:33,668 --> 00:38:38,513
I want to make sure you know that I really like you “krub”.

413
00:38:53,777 --> 00:38:54,950
Let go of my hand.

414
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:57,494
Why?

415
00:39:00,439 --> 00:39:04,545
I need to get some sleep. Big day tomorrow.

416
00:39:06,194 --> 00:39:07,965
Can I just hold your hand for five more seconds, please?

417
00:39:21,532 --> 00:39:22,543
It's been five seconds.

418
00:39:28,585 --> 00:39:29,574
Fine, I'll leave.

419
00:39:30,989 --> 00:39:31,812
Sweet dreams.

420
00:39:31,949 --> 00:39:34,156
Sweet dreams. See you later.

421
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:35,769
Let me put the glass away.

422
00:39:38,058 --> 00:39:39,062
Sweet dreams.

423
00:39:41,702 --> 00:39:42,649
Sweet dreams.

424
00:40:01,212 --> 00:40:04,004
Hello, everyone. I’m Nita.

425
00:40:04,004 --> 00:40:07,004
I’ll be the judge of today’s debate.

426
00:40:07,216 --> 00:40:11,770
Our burning question is “Are you the master of your fate?”

427
00:40:11,902 --> 00:40:13,796
I’m Zo from the Affirmative.

428
00:40:15,481 --> 00:40:17,162
I’m Pok from the Negative.

429
00:40:17,162 --> 00:40:18,447
The Affirmative, kick us off.

430
00:40:20,102 --> 00:40:23,604
We're in control of our lives, plain and simple.

431
00:40:23,822 --> 00:40:26,124
Every choice, every right – they're ours.

432
00:40:28,605 --> 00:40:30,259
That's not always true.

433
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:34,084
Even though we technically have rights,

434
00:40:34,663 --> 00:40:42,383
a kid can't exactly make all their own choices, right?"

435
00:40:49,059 --> 00:40:53,320
Bro, feels like we have fewer students this year?

436
00:40:54,916 --> 00:40:55,814
Seems so.

437
00:40:59,937 --> 00:41:02,628
Excuse me, my friend's kinda into you.

438
00:41:02,628 --> 00:41:04,241
Can she have your Line ID?

439
00:41:04,423 --> 00:41:07,673
Or maybe your IG if you're more comfy with that

440
00:41:08,568 --> 00:41:10,914
I don’t think that’s a good idea as I’m not single.

441
00:41:11,872 --> 00:41:12,803
Sorry.

442
00:41:13,338 --> 00:41:14,091
Bummer.

443
00:41:15,448 --> 00:41:18,604
What about you? Are you single? Can I have your IG?

444
00:41:20,217 --> 00:41:23,999
Yes, I am. I can give you my IG.

445
00:41:31,966 --> 00:41:33,327
Thank you.

446
00:41:35,605 --> 00:41:41,223
I’d better snap some photos at other places. See you later.

447
00:41:56,021 --> 00:41:57,915
What are you doing standing here looking handsome?

448
00:41:59,246 --> 00:42:02,417
Just keeping an eye on Zo.

449
00:42:03,605 --> 00:42:06,962
Zo doesn’t seem to get tired at all.

450
00:42:07,769 --> 00:42:08,794
Look at these girls.

451
00:42:08,794 --> 00:42:10,284
They all look like they’re falling for him.

452
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:12,942
Aren’t you jealous?

453
00:42:14,598 --> 00:42:15,593
There's no room for jealousy.

454
00:42:16,598 --> 00:42:18,135
Zo is working.

455
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:20,444
Working, huh?

456
00:42:21,335 --> 00:42:25,862
But that cute girl over there ain’t here for his work.

457
00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:29,273
She looks like…

458
00:42:34,988 --> 00:42:35,931
What are you guys doing?

459
00:42:37,102 --> 00:42:38,452
And he said he wasn’t jealous.

460
00:42:39,205 --> 00:42:40,805
- He’ll be right back.
- We’re still in the middle of something.

461
00:42:40,805 --> 00:42:41,721
Wait a minute.

462
00:42:41,881 --> 00:42:42,532
Come on.

463
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:50,101
My apartment is quite messy.

464
00:42:54,304 --> 00:42:57,586
How do you even live in this chaos?

465
00:42:59,174 --> 00:43:01,174
I can give you a hand cleaning up if you want.

466
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:04,539
You’d do that?

467
00:43:04,725 --> 00:43:05,716
Absolutely.

468
00:43:05,716 --> 00:43:06,647
That's very kind of you.

469
00:43:07,233 --> 00:43:09,339
Alright, let's tidy up this apartment.

470
00:43:13,486 --> 00:43:15,244
Start with the dishes.

471
00:43:15,435 --> 00:43:16,717
I mean, you ate and just left them there!

472
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:19,484
Just because you're helping doesn't mean you get to scold me..

473
00:43:32,389 --> 00:43:33,724
Toss that into the basket.

474
00:43:47,829 --> 00:43:49,829
Ouch!

475
00:43:49,829 --> 00:43:52,665
Be careful, man.

476
00:43:57,621 --> 00:43:58,610
Smells so good.

477
00:44:00,871 --> 00:44:02,201
I need to try this.

478
00:44:12,174 --> 00:44:12,834
What do you think?

479
00:44:15,681 --> 00:44:16,728
It's delicious.

480
00:44:18,912 --> 00:44:20,433
Props to grandma.

481
00:44:21,338 --> 00:44:22,987
Her recipes are legendary.

482
00:44:23,868 --> 00:44:25,522
I have plenty of plates here.

483
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:30,435
Did you just dodge it?

484
00:44:37,469 --> 00:44:38,964
You are a fine cook.

485
00:44:39,901 --> 00:44:41,209
That's no secret to my cooking.

486
00:44:43,204 --> 00:44:44,274
I just put in some magic powder.

487
00:44:46,083 --> 00:44:47,013
What powder?

488
00:44:47,795 --> 00:44:49,263
The “I Love You” powder.

489
00:44:56,313 --> 00:44:57,045
Come on.

490
00:45:10,135 --> 00:45:11,387
I'm so full.

491
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:17,483
Hey, it’s already half past midnight.

492
00:45:19,498 --> 00:45:20,437
Do you want to crash here?

493
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:24,265
I didn't pack an overnight bag or anything.

494
00:45:25,252 --> 00:45:26,346
That’s fine.

495
00:45:26,772 --> 00:45:28,104
You can borrow mine.

496
00:45:29,305 --> 00:45:31,571
I don't want you to go home alone. It's already late.

497
00:45:32,032 --> 00:45:33,066
But I…

498
00:45:33,172 --> 00:45:36,586
Zo, please. You can spend the night here.

499
00:45:40,245 --> 00:45:41,391
I’m not expecting anything.

500
00:45:42,562 --> 00:45:43,762
I just care about your safety.

501
00:45:45,754 --> 00:45:50,627
And I care about your safety because I like you.

502
00:45:58,934 --> 00:46:01,913
I’ve been thinking about us.

503
00:46:04,206 --> 00:46:05,345
I…

504
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:06,132
Zo,

505
00:46:08,181 --> 00:46:09,719
just take it slow.

506
00:46:12,495 --> 00:46:14,628
Before diving into something new,

507
00:46:15,891 --> 00:46:17,578
I feel like I need to close the previous chapter.

508
00:46:20,267 --> 00:46:22,161
I want to tell you about Nita.

509
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:32,550
Planning to win over Nita made me realize

510
00:46:33,294 --> 00:46:35,001
That I don’t actually have romantic feelings for her.

511
00:46:37,125 --> 00:46:42,265
I told her straight that my feelings for her

512
00:46:43,830 --> 00:46:48,604
were more admiration than anything else.

513
00:46:50,702 --> 00:46:52,613
Nita is great.

514
00:46:53,917 --> 00:46:55,851
She’s one of the people I admire.

515
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:00,445
How are you feeling now?

516
00:47:07,951 --> 00:47:09,455
Lighter.

517
00:47:11,397 --> 00:47:13,014
Like I've cleared the air.

518
00:47:20,231 --> 00:47:20,899
Hey.

519
00:47:22,948 --> 00:47:24,280
Are you listening to me?

520
00:47:25,374 --> 00:47:26,842
Yes, I am.

521
00:47:34,981 --> 00:47:35,724
Zo,

522
00:47:37,347 --> 00:47:38,391
can I ask you something?

523
00:47:41,967 --> 00:47:45,883
How do you feel about me now?

524
00:48:05,848 --> 00:48:10,349
It feels so hot in here. I think I need a shower.

525
00:48:19,204 --> 00:48:22,534
We've come too far for me to let you get away this time.

526
00:48:39,056 --> 00:48:40,125
The bathroom is over there.

527
00:49:15,282 --> 00:49:18,107
Relax and enjoy yourself here. Make yourself comfortable.

528
00:49:38,065 --> 00:49:39,905
You know the meaning of the T-shirt you’re wearing?

529
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:48,505
You gave it to me.

530
00:49:50,649 --> 00:49:51,904
I gave you two options.

531
00:49:55,132 --> 00:49:57,877
You picked this one. What does it mean?

532
00:49:59,921 --> 00:50:01,176
Are you ready to give us a chance?

533
00:50:02,484 --> 00:50:06,559
I just picked it to wear.

534
00:50:12,413 --> 00:50:13,382
Take it off.

535
00:50:15,111 --> 00:50:16,514
You want me to take it off?

536
00:50:17,175 --> 00:50:18,604
If you don’t get its meaning, maybe you should just take it off.

537
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:21,727
If you're shy, I could take it off first.

538
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:23,817
No, no!

539
00:50:26,003 --> 00:50:28,109
Put it back on.

540
00:50:28,109 --> 00:50:28,982
No!

541
00:50:29,672 --> 00:50:31,300
Yes! Shirt. On. Now.

542
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:31,953
No!

543
00:50:31,953 --> 00:50:32,663
You’re not putting it back on?

544
00:50:32,663 --> 00:50:36,240
Fine. You’re not putting it back on, huh?

545
00:50:36,758 --> 00:50:38,439
You’re not putting it back on?

546
00:50:58,965 --> 00:50:59,775
Zo.

547
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:04,689
I’m serious about us.

548
00:51:14,397 --> 00:51:15,333
I…

549
00:51:18,604 --> 00:51:20,011
Take it slow.

550
00:51:22,698 --> 00:51:23,903
I won’t rush you.

551
00:51:32,519 --> 00:51:33,455
Put this on.

552
00:51:55,686 --> 00:51:56,863
You’re still shirtless.

553
00:51:58,406 --> 00:51:59,468
It's really hot in here.

554
00:52:01,189 --> 00:52:04,306
You've got to be joking. It's practically an ice box.

555
00:52:06,182 --> 00:52:07,674
I just...

556
00:52:12,516 --> 00:52:13,599
...want to hold you.

557
00:52:16,738 --> 00:52:17,738
Just that.

558
00:52:39,899 --> 00:52:44,044
Silence means “yes”, right?

559
00:53:00,807 --> 00:53:06,931
Did you know when you hug for 30 seconds,

560
00:53:10,605 --> 00:53:13,323
the bodies will release oxytocin

561
00:53:15,575 --> 00:53:23,295
which creates a stronger bond, connection, and trust between the huggers?

562
00:53:29,511 --> 00:53:34,544
What happens if we hug longer?

563
00:53:36,919 --> 00:53:42,351
In that case, it means we feel the same.

564
00:54:30,254 --> 00:54:32,254
Why did you choose this place for our date?

565
00:54:32,254 --> 00:54:33,909
I have fond memories of this place.

566
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:37,004
Who were you here with? Your ex?

567
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:41,683
Relax. My grandma is as sweet as you.

568
00:54:42,246 --> 00:54:43,927
You cannot talk to Zo this way.

569
00:54:44,119 --> 00:54:46,624
Why is he wearing your shirt? Did you spend the night together?

570
00:54:46,804 --> 00:54:50,853
You didn't mention he was a guy, just that you’re bringing over a friend.

571
00:54:50,853 --> 00:54:52,803
But I could tell that he’s not just a friend.

572
00:54:53,032 --> 00:54:53,956
You know him?

573
00:54:54,089 --> 00:54:56,868
I noticed you have been avoiding him since we were inside.
