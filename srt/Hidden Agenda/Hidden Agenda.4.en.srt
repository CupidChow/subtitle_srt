1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
Rule no. 1, know your personality and posture.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:07,177
So you're telling me you'd play Nita, and I'd be...dating you?

3
00:00:07,177 --> 00:00:09,478
I'll be evaluating your date performance.

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,200
Try asking me out.

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,772
Would you like to go on a date with me?

6
00:00:12,988 --> 00:00:16,040
I didn’t feel my heart race when I was with her.

7
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,336
When I have a crush on someone, I feel the same.

8
00:00:19,675 --> 00:00:20,869
I'm off to Chiang Khan.

9
00:00:21,094 --> 00:00:22,000
Let me come with you.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,202
Follow me if you want to come.

11
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,606
Joke!

12
00:01:15,292 --> 00:01:16,960
CHIANG KHAN, LOEI PROVINCE

13
00:01:32,432 --> 00:01:33,314
I’m sorry.

14
00:01:34,432 --> 00:01:35,550
I’m so tired.

15
00:01:36,339 --> 00:01:38,817
It's okay. You can go back to sleep.

16
00:01:57,018 --> 00:01:59,468
Wake up. We're here.

17
00:02:04,575 --> 00:02:05,544
Let’s go.

18
00:02:08,019 --> 00:02:09,050
Come on!

19
00:02:09,248 --> 00:02:10,348
You go first.

20
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:21,759
What do you think? Isn’t it amazing?

21
00:02:24,842 --> 00:02:25,970
Are you fully awake?

22
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,720
Nu Zo!

23
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,940
You've made it!

24
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:33,280
Hello.

25
00:02:34,092 --> 00:02:35,389
How are you doing?

26
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:36,592
Great.

27
00:02:37,386 --> 00:02:40,483
I almost didn't manage to reserve a room in time.

28
00:02:41,344 --> 00:02:43,344
And I see you brought a friend along this time.

29
00:02:43,695 --> 00:02:44,641
Oh, right.

30
00:02:44,641 --> 00:02:46,398
It's always good to have company on a trip.

31
00:02:46,398 --> 00:02:46,989
That's right.

32
00:02:48,474 --> 00:02:49,920
Look, a monk is coming.

33
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,569
Vulnerable, please.

34
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:52,626
Vulnerable.

35
00:02:52,626 --> 00:02:53,629
Let's give alms.

36
00:02:53,859 --> 00:02:54,627
Alright.

37
00:02:56,371 --> 00:02:57,603
Put on this glove.

38
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:58,781
Okay.

39
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:02,024
On your right hand.

40
00:03:02,024 --> 00:03:02,846
Do I just grab some?

41
00:03:02,846 --> 00:03:03,638
That’s right.

42
00:03:06,001 --> 00:03:06,883
Put it in the bowl.

43
00:03:08,514 --> 00:03:09,280
Alright.

44
00:03:13,466 --> 00:03:14,347
Some food.

45
00:03:17,357 --> 00:03:18,640
And desserts.

46
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,413
Blessings to you.

47
00:03:21,312 --> 00:03:33,073
[Buddhist chant]

48
00:03:33,316 --> 00:03:35,316
Amen.

49
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,511
Let's get you settled in your room.

50
00:03:40,074 --> 00:03:42,359
Give me the gloves.

51
00:03:42,359 --> 00:03:43,374
I almost forgot.

52
00:03:45,168 --> 00:03:46,236
Put your shoes back on and follow me.

53
00:03:46,236 --> 00:03:46,999
Sure.

54
00:03:57,213 --> 00:03:58,628
Come on in.

55
00:03:59,866 --> 00:04:02,026
How do you like the room?

56
00:04:02,869 --> 00:04:05,150
The bed is quite comfy, you’ll sleep like a baby.

57
00:04:10,704 --> 00:04:15,011
There's no air conditioning. Is this the only room available?

58
00:04:15,351 --> 00:04:16,716
Yes.

59
00:04:17,025 --> 00:04:21,289
Your booking was quite last-minute.

60
00:04:21,572 --> 00:04:24,135
This is the only room we had left.

61
00:04:24,955 --> 00:04:27,518
But you usually book a room without air conditioning anyway.

62
00:04:28,999 --> 00:04:30,999
[He may…]

63
00:04:31,545 --> 00:04:34,417
Oh… your friend…

64
00:04:34,786 --> 00:04:37,144
He needs air conditioning?

65
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:38,244
[Yeah]

66
00:04:39,281 --> 00:04:41,281
How about…

67
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,672
It's okay.

68
00:04:43,102 --> 00:04:44,140
I’ll manage.

69
00:04:45,293 --> 00:04:46,559
Are you sure?

70
00:04:46,756 --> 00:04:47,746
Alright.

71
00:04:48,179 --> 00:04:50,770
I’ll prepare your breakfast.

72
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:53,439
Something extra yummy, please.

73
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:54,576
Will do.

74
00:05:28,878 --> 00:05:30,456
Are you really okay with this, Joke?

75
00:05:32,183 --> 00:05:34,324
Yes, I am fine.

76
00:05:36,001 --> 00:05:38,001
Is it that you don't want to share a room with me?

77
00:05:40,403 --> 00:05:41,284
No.

78
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,201
… I'm just worried that you might not be comfortable.

79
00:05:46,065 --> 00:05:49,809
This room is small and lacks air conditioning.

80
00:05:50,812 --> 00:05:53,065
I’m worried you won’t sleep well.

81
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:55,702
Chill out.

82
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:58,253
I'm not that high-maintenance.

83
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,860
Your breakfast is ready.

84
00:06:04,404 --> 00:06:05,302
Great.

85
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:07,565
Have a shower.

86
00:06:07,989 --> 00:06:09,370
We'll be right there.

87
00:06:29,218 --> 00:06:32,343
Pan-fried eggs. Quite a sight, isn’t it?

88
00:06:32,343 --> 00:06:34,814
Wow, thank you.

89
00:06:34,814 --> 00:06:35,648
Look at this.

90
00:06:38,642 --> 00:06:41,233
I didn't get your name. What should I call you?

91
00:06:41,233 --> 00:06:42,857
My name is Joke.

92
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:44,720
Nu Joke.

93
00:06:45,165 --> 00:06:46,996
You don’t need to add the “Nu.”

94
00:06:46,996 --> 00:06:48,841
Let me go attend to the front desk.

95
00:06:49,217 --> 00:06:51,217
Enjoy your breakfast.

96
00:06:55,898 --> 00:06:59,480
Hey, does he call everyone “Nu”?

97
00:07:00,769 --> 00:07:02,206
Don't mind him.

98
00:07:06,393 --> 00:07:08,393
Why do you seem so close to him?

99
00:07:10,008 --> 00:07:11,699
We're not that close exactly.

100
00:07:11,851 --> 00:07:14,160
I'm just a frequent guest here.

101
00:07:15,121 --> 00:07:20,075
Ever since I first came with my family and later on my own,

102
00:07:20,238 --> 00:07:22,041
I’ve always stayed at this homestay.

103
00:07:35,269 --> 00:07:36,056
Joke.

104
00:07:37,744 --> 00:07:38,440
Hmm?

105
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:42,813
Why did you want to come with me on this rugged trip?

106
00:07:44,032 --> 00:07:46,032
I know it’s not your style at all.

107
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:50,648
I told you, I needed a vacation.

108
00:07:52,837 --> 00:07:54,509
And you thought I bought that?

109
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,125
You're a terrible liar.

110
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,207
And I'm not stupid.

111
00:08:03,607 --> 00:08:04,628
To be honest,

112
00:08:06,259 --> 00:08:11,160
how could anyone leave you sad and alone when you're in this state?

113
00:08:13,206 --> 00:08:14,812
You are my dear student.

114
00:08:15,405 --> 00:08:16,440
I will never abandon you.

115
00:08:25,659 --> 00:08:31,560
When a person is sad, he needs some time alone.

116
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,257
Have you tried being in someone else’s company?

117
00:08:34,118 --> 00:08:35,418
It might be better than being on your own.

118
00:08:39,047 --> 00:08:42,283
Bro, I can’t believe you’re here!

119
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,533
I could say the same.

120
00:08:49,046 --> 00:08:53,594
Zo, this is Jeng, my cousin.

121
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:54,802
Hello.

122
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,504
I think you've met him before. He shot a VTR for the club.

123
00:08:59,008 --> 00:08:59,827
Jeng….

124
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,061
Oh, you filmed a VTR for us that day.

125
00:09:05,061 --> 00:09:05,806
That’s me.

126
00:09:06,228 --> 00:09:10,408
would you prefer sharing a room with your cousin?

127
00:09:10,961 --> 00:09:11,688
Hmm?

128
00:09:12,588 --> 00:09:16,440
You don't want to share a room with me?

129
00:09:18,455 --> 00:09:22,171
No, I’m good with our arrangement.

130
00:09:23,581 --> 00:09:25,468
And besides, Jeng didn’t come alone.

131
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,138
Where is Pok, your boyfriend?

132
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,427
I think he's on the phone. He'll join us in a bit.

133
00:09:37,364 --> 00:09:38,191
Pok…

134
00:09:39,147 --> 00:09:42,000
Pok from International Relations. Your junior.

135
00:09:42,904 --> 00:09:49,630
Wait… Jeng and Pok… are you two a couple?

136
00:09:50,272 --> 00:09:51,219
You didn’t know?

137
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,053
Zo!

138
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:00,271
Hello.

139
00:10:05,081 --> 00:10:06,100
Have a seat.

140
00:10:17,702 --> 00:10:19,815
How did you end up at the same homestay as us?

141
00:10:21,768 --> 00:10:24,781
Pok saw Zo's check-ins here often.

142
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:27,740
He liked the ambiance and thought we should give it a try.

143
00:10:29,238 --> 00:10:32,954
Quite a coincidence bumping into you here!

144
00:10:35,893 --> 00:10:37,077
Quite a coincidence indeed.

145
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:44,149
Where are you headed next?

146
00:10:45,856 --> 00:10:50,106
Probably Phu Tok.

147
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:51,389
Oh, Phu Tok.

148
00:10:51,614 --> 00:10:54,324
How about we go together? We were planning to visit there too.

149
00:11:21,809 --> 00:11:23,809
One, two, three!

150
00:11:59,297 --> 00:12:01,297
You already got a good photo.

151
00:12:01,297 --> 00:12:03,764
Now, give me a funny face with a funny pose.

152
00:12:05,979 --> 00:12:07,120
Is that all you got?

153
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,598
You look like a sick puppy.

154
00:12:19,118 --> 00:12:19,918
Jeng,

155
00:12:20,818 --> 00:12:22,131
I’m going to check on Zo.

156
00:12:29,826 --> 00:12:30,798
Come on.

157
00:12:41,012 --> 00:12:42,449
Zo must be upset with me.

158
00:12:45,841 --> 00:12:47,419
Let me get a picture of you.

159
00:12:48,415 --> 00:12:51,174
I didn’t give you permission. Ever heard of privacy?

160
00:12:51,658 --> 00:12:53,658
Just for fun, trip memories.

161
00:12:54,015 --> 00:12:56,521
It's a great shot, by the way.

162
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:01,080
But I can delete it if you're uncomfortable.

163
00:13:01,522 --> 00:13:02,903
No need to delete it.

164
00:13:03,591 --> 00:13:05,225
I'm just here to unwind.

165
00:13:19,601 --> 00:13:21,067
Are you bothered about Pok?

166
00:13:26,929 --> 00:13:28,037
No, I’m not.

167
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,314
It’s just that this is news to me.

168
00:13:36,302 --> 00:13:38,386
He probably wasn't ready to tell you.

169
00:13:40,795 --> 00:13:45,355
Or maybe they were still figuring things out.

170
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:54,823
I didn’t know until Jeng told me.

171
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:01,794
I get it, it's personal.

172
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:04,958
But Pok and I are close.

173
00:14:05,701 --> 00:14:08,179
He’s my peer mentee.

174
00:14:10,157 --> 00:14:13,788
Finding out like this feels off.

175
00:14:21,141 --> 00:14:23,141
Am I not trustworthy?

176
00:14:25,113 --> 00:14:25,836
Zo.

177
00:14:28,565 --> 00:14:30,235
Stop trying to think what he might think.

178
00:14:32,213 --> 00:14:35,338
You need to have a heart-to-heart chat with him.

179
00:14:37,323 --> 00:14:40,448
I just don’t want anyone to feel weird around me.

180
00:14:42,217 --> 00:14:43,158
Calm down.

181
00:14:44,705 --> 00:14:47,846
This isn't just about Pok, it it?

182
00:15:04,358 --> 00:15:07,483
What's been going on with you… since this morning?

183
00:15:08,851 --> 00:15:11,779
Why do you feel like people are uncomfortable around you?

184
00:15:17,597 --> 00:15:19,597
Maybe I'm overthinking.

185
00:15:20,954 --> 00:15:23,010
But when I was with Nita at the library,

186
00:15:25,356 --> 00:15:29,803
it seemed like she was very uncomfortable around me.

187
00:15:32,725 --> 00:15:34,866
It's not the same, I know.

188
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:37,411
But I can’t shake that feeling.

189
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:42,572
I just don’t want to make anyone uncomfortable.

190
00:15:46,857 --> 00:15:48,044
Look, I’m not Nita.

191
00:15:50,969 --> 00:15:52,345
I’m not Pok.

192
00:15:54,834 --> 00:15:58,550
Not everyone feels awkward around you.

193
00:16:01,153 --> 00:16:04,728
I don't feel the slightest bit uncomfortable with you.

194
00:16:08,102 --> 00:16:09,427
In fact, quite the opposite.

195
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:14,298
Really?

196
00:16:16,239 --> 00:16:18,652
Yes, I mean it.

197
00:16:20,364 --> 00:16:26,415
Does that mean it's all just in my head?

198
00:16:29,543 --> 00:16:30,491
I can't say for sure.

199
00:16:32,376 --> 00:16:35,256
You don't need to analyze everything.

200
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:41,725
You're just a good person who cares deeply about others.

201
00:16:44,063 --> 00:16:45,782
Try being nonchalant like me.

202
00:16:48,001 --> 00:16:51,661
The whole faculty gossips about me, but do I care? No.

203
00:16:52,241 --> 00:16:54,000
You could try showing some care for a change.

204
00:16:56,177 --> 00:17:00,906
I only care for those who matter to me. Isn't that enough?

205
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:23,863
Bro, let’s get moving. We have another place to visit.

206
00:17:23,863 --> 00:17:25,355
Stop giving each other the doe eyes.

207
00:17:27,474 --> 00:17:28,694
Zip it and go back to where you came from.

208
00:17:29,116 --> 00:17:33,497
That’s the same place as yours, isn't it? Come on!

209
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:37,854
What are you laughing at?

210
00:17:38,726 --> 00:17:39,682
Nothing.

211
00:17:39,682 --> 00:17:40,982
Let’s get going.

212
00:17:58,666 --> 00:17:59,547
Wow!

213
00:18:09,862 --> 00:18:11,419
What an amazing view!

214
00:18:31,887 --> 00:18:32,945
Zo...

215
00:18:34,133 --> 00:18:35,870
I thought heights didn't scare you.

216
00:18:36,899 --> 00:18:41,155
They don't, but walking on a glass floor? That's gut-wrenching.

217
00:18:44,469 --> 00:18:45,491
Don't worry.

218
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,418
This glass is solid, just transparent. See?

219
00:18:53,941 --> 00:18:58,131
Now, I'll go over there to take some photos of the view.

220
00:18:58,131 --> 00:18:59,333
You wait here, okay?

221
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:02,941
Zo, I'd rather come with you.

222
00:19:10,029 --> 00:19:13,234
There's a rail for you to hold on to.

223
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:16,250
It’s not the same, Zo.

224
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:20,362
So between the steel rail and my arm,

225
00:19:21,108 --> 00:19:22,692
you're choosing my arm?

226
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:24,833
It’s just not the same, Zo.

227
00:19:25,533 --> 00:19:31,970
If you're scared, just focus on the view, not what's beneath you.

228
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,362
Looking down will only make it worse.

229
00:19:37,377 --> 00:19:39,377
It's just...

230
00:19:41,314 --> 00:19:42,995
so high.

231
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:44,682
Don’t let the height intimidate you.

232
00:19:46,763 --> 00:19:48,346
But try to understand. I am scared.

233
00:19:49,678 --> 00:19:54,370
Alright, let's take this step by step.

234
00:19:57,427 --> 00:20:01,539
Slowly now, don't look down. Just don’t.

235
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:05,325
Here, focus on the view.

236
00:20:05,907 --> 00:20:08,345
Don’t close your eyes because that will make it worse.

237
00:20:08,345 --> 00:20:10,635
Here, focus on the view.

238
00:20:11,905 --> 00:20:13,168
Look at the amazing view.

239
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:22,998
Just relax and and keep looking there.

240
00:20:23,248 --> 00:20:23,910
Okay…

241
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:28,339
Now, let me take some pictures for my family. You stay here.

242
00:20:28,668 --> 00:20:31,062
No. I'm coming with you.

243
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:35,450
Just stay here for a second. I'll be back quickly after I take this one photo.

244
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:37,290
Try to relax

245
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,179
and take deep breaths.

246
00:20:42,161 --> 00:20:42,868
Good job.

247
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:45,671
Let me snap a photo of you here.

248
00:20:48,768 --> 00:20:50,286
Now, smile.

249
00:20:52,103 --> 00:20:52,964
Go already.

250
00:21:02,569 --> 00:21:03,497
Are you done?

251
00:21:03,694 --> 00:21:05,335
Calm down. I just got here.

252
00:21:15,055 --> 00:21:15,752
Zo,

253
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,410
I’m scared.

254
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:20,944
Don’t hug me.

255
00:21:21,567 --> 00:21:22,998
It’s so high up.

256
00:21:24,675 --> 00:21:26,675
Don’t hug me, let go.

257
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:30,799
Hold on to the rail.

258
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:35,368
Are you messing with me?

259
00:21:36,156 --> 00:21:37,198
Not at all.

260
00:21:38,003 --> 00:21:38,820
Are you done?

261
00:21:39,192 --> 00:21:40,244
Let's get going.

262
00:21:42,721 --> 00:21:44,136
Let me see if I got the photo.

263
00:21:44,815 --> 00:21:46,188
Just kidding.

264
00:21:46,188 --> 00:21:46,941
Zo!

265
00:21:47,704 --> 00:21:48,775
I got it.

266
00:21:49,563 --> 00:21:51,250
Shall we head back?

267
00:21:52,482 --> 00:21:54,263
It's bad karma to torture someone who's afraid.

268
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:55,619
The Buddha statue is over there.

269
00:21:56,955 --> 00:21:57,733
Let’s go.

270
00:21:59,003 --> 00:21:59,716
Let’s go.

271
00:22:02,134 --> 00:22:04,660
Smile for the camera, come on.

272
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,118
Show those teeth.

273
00:22:07,118 --> 00:22:08,824
One, two, three!

274
00:22:09,218 --> 00:22:10,109
Nice.

275
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,370
Now, give me a big grin like you’re selling toothpaste.

276
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:17,782
Awesome!

277
00:22:21,532 --> 00:22:22,718
That's enough.

278
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:25,471
I'm telling you, just stop.

279
00:22:26,091 --> 00:22:27,254
You've taken enough photos already.

280
00:22:27,342 --> 00:22:28,717
Having a lot of photos isn't a bad thing, you know.

281
00:22:29,133 --> 00:22:30,960
You could use one for a new profile picture.

282
00:22:31,985 --> 00:22:34,248
You've been using the same one since our freshman year.

283
00:22:34,583 --> 00:22:35,838
It's been three years already.

284
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,099
I'm not big on photos.

285
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:42,000
Plus, who changes their profile picture every month like you do?

286
00:22:42,654 --> 00:22:43,847
I'm just trying to help you out here.

287
00:22:45,949 --> 00:22:49,296
Oh, by the way, what time should we leave for Kaeng Khut Khu?

288
00:22:50,377 --> 00:22:54,567
Sunset's around 6:30 p.m.,

289
00:22:56,037 --> 00:22:59,850
so we should leave by 5:40.

290
00:23:01,786 --> 00:23:03,786
So, we've got a lot of time left.

291
00:23:04,372 --> 00:23:06,372
Yeah, what's up?

292
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,016
Let's make a story video.

293
00:23:10,703 --> 00:23:13,426
More filming?

294
00:23:13,426 --> 00:23:15,100
Just bear with me, Zo. Scoot over.

295
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:18,367
Smile.

296
00:23:20,075 --> 00:23:26,250
This time, shake your head while smiling. We're doing a Boomerang.

297
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:26,999
A what now?

298
00:23:26,999 --> 00:23:27,716
A Boomerang.

299
00:23:27,716 --> 00:23:28,394
What is it?

300
00:23:28,394 --> 00:23:29,212
Just go with it.

301
00:23:29,735 --> 00:23:30,631
Shake your head.

302
00:23:30,631 --> 00:23:33,597
Three, two, one!

303
00:23:36,115 --> 00:23:37,261
You got it.

304
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:42,001
The video was not clear. Let’s start over.

305
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:43,635
What’s that pose of yours?

306
00:23:44,665 --> 00:23:46,928
Excuse me, have you seen a wallet dropped here?

307
00:23:47,474 --> 00:23:48,331
Nothing?

308
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:51,489
Jeng.

309
00:23:51,739 --> 00:23:52,596
Bro.

310
00:23:57,239 --> 00:23:59,258
What's wrong? You look so stressed out.

311
00:24:00,915 --> 00:24:02,322
Pok’s wallet is missing.

312
00:24:02,738 --> 00:24:04,098
We can't find it anywhere.

313
00:24:04,098 --> 00:24:05,254
The people here said it's not here.

314
00:24:06,330 --> 00:24:07,100
Pok,

315
00:24:08,086 --> 00:24:11,572
do you remember the last time you used your wallet?

316
00:24:12,064 --> 00:24:13,538
I haven't used it at all.

317
00:24:14,437 --> 00:24:15,846
Jeng has been paying for everything.

318
00:24:16,639 --> 00:24:18,989
I only realized it when it's gone.

319
00:24:20,886 --> 00:24:22,886
Hope you didn’t drop it at Phu Thok.

320
00:24:23,677 --> 00:24:24,461
Did you try calling them?

321
00:24:25,556 --> 00:24:27,890
We did, but they said they couldn’t find it.

322
00:24:29,208 --> 00:24:32,930
The first photo Pok and I took together was in that wallet.

323
00:24:38,332 --> 00:24:41,537
How about this? What places have you guys visited?

324
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:43,755
We can help you retrace your steps.

325
00:24:48,534 --> 00:24:49,552
Are you sure about this?

326
00:24:50,844 --> 00:24:54,542
Of course. We're here for you.

327
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:55,880
Trust me,

328
00:24:56,866 --> 00:24:58,130
we'll find it.

329
00:25:05,031 --> 00:25:08,674
Excuse me, have you seen a wallet lying around?

330
00:25:12,426 --> 00:25:14,141
It’s a small black wallet.

331
00:25:14,853 --> 00:25:15,973
I’m afraid not.

332
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,130
No?

333
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:17,829
No.

334
00:25:45,659 --> 00:25:48,382
Let’s call it off. I don’t think we should look any further.

335
00:25:51,067 --> 00:25:52,064
Call Joke and let him know.

336
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:56,826
Pok,

337
00:25:57,724 --> 00:25:58,881
don’t lose hope just yet.

338
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,250
We'll find it if we keep looking.

339
00:26:04,682 --> 00:26:06,485
We would have found it by now.

340
00:26:13,841 --> 00:26:17,286
If you're not going to call Joke, I will.

341
00:26:56,427 --> 00:26:57,410
Hey!

342
00:27:05,141 --> 00:27:06,539
We've been almost everywhere in this town.

343
00:27:07,141 --> 00:27:08,006
You're right.

344
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:15,953
Oh, it’s Pok.

345
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,912
Hey, what’s up?

346
00:27:21,753 --> 00:27:23,170
I found my wallet.

347
00:27:23,848 --> 00:27:25,738
You did! Where did you find it?

348
00:27:26,553 --> 00:27:28,903
You’re kidding me.

349
00:27:30,985 --> 00:27:34,036
Alright, see you later.

350
00:27:40,109 --> 00:27:41,011
Where was it?

351
00:27:42,109 --> 00:27:44,214
He dropped it at the homestay.

352
00:27:44,521 --> 00:27:45,264
Dang!

353
00:27:47,016 --> 00:27:48,217
We've been looking all over the place for it.

354
00:28:05,439 --> 00:28:07,508
Let's head back now.

355
00:28:11,377 --> 00:28:12,939
So, we're not going to Kaeng Khut Khu anymore?

356
00:28:14,139 --> 00:28:15,568
I don't think we can.

357
00:28:17,999 --> 00:28:21,155
It's already 6:05.

358
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:23,370
We can make it, trust me.

359
00:28:24,415 --> 00:28:27,707
Is it that way? Over there, right?

360
00:28:27,707 --> 00:28:31,369
Come on, let’s go. Hurry up, Zo!

361
00:28:33,468 --> 00:28:34,680
We can still make it.

362
00:28:48,691 --> 00:28:49,784
We didn't make it.

363
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:55,066
I'm sorry.

364
00:28:58,690 --> 00:28:59,820
No need to apologize,

365
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:02,000
it’s not your fault.

366
00:29:05,591 --> 00:29:06,962
But I can't help feeling like we’ve left something unfinished.

367
00:29:09,357 --> 00:29:11,273
I should be thanking you, actually.

368
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,689
You went out of your way for me.

369
00:29:18,306 --> 00:29:19,612
I felt that...

370
00:29:24,207 --> 00:29:25,756
this place was important to you.

371
00:29:28,688 --> 00:29:32,252
It is important.

372
00:29:35,364 --> 00:29:38,293
If we didn't make it today, there's always next time.

373
00:29:42,282 --> 00:29:43,302
Can I ask

374
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:48,690
why this place holds so much importance to you?

375
00:29:50,646 --> 00:29:52,059
Do you really want to know?

376
00:29:54,778 --> 00:29:55,553
Yes.

377
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:01,373
When I was in high school,

378
00:30:02,084 --> 00:30:10,097
my parents would come here every year to watch the sunset.

379
00:30:11,135 --> 00:30:15,897
This place holds a special place in my family's heart, and we’re here every time.

380
00:30:21,302 --> 00:30:25,208
Each visit, I feel an immense joy being here.

381
00:30:26,252 --> 00:30:28,694
Watching the sun go down,

382
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:33,423
casting golden rays on the water,

383
00:30:34,811 --> 00:30:36,001
the birds chirping,

384
00:30:37,907 --> 00:30:39,010
the cool breeze passing...

385
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:48,066
And when I'm with someone I love,

386
00:30:54,421 --> 00:30:55,967
it feels so relaxing,

387
00:30:59,096 --> 00:31:00,102
so warm.

388
00:31:01,471 --> 00:31:05,393
I long to feel that way again,

389
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:08,890
if only for a bit.

390
00:31:17,952 --> 00:31:22,372
It's kind of embarrassing, sharing this with you.

391
00:31:27,098 --> 00:31:31,469
Thank you for sharing that with me.

392
00:31:43,755 --> 00:31:46,244
I think I'm going to take a short walk around here.

393
00:31:48,092 --> 00:31:48,943
Go ahead.

394
00:32:35,665 --> 00:32:36,797
Zo, can you do me a favor?

395
00:32:39,926 --> 00:32:40,794
What is it?

396
00:32:43,329 --> 00:32:44,325
Can you do it for me?

397
00:32:46,549 --> 00:32:47,895
What is it that you need me to do?

398
00:32:49,012 --> 00:32:49,650
Here.

399
00:32:50,408 --> 00:32:51,428
What’s happening?

400
00:32:52,113 --> 00:32:53,917
Close your eyes.

401
00:32:54,032 --> 00:32:55,040
I don't want to.

402
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,032
Come on, man.

403
00:32:56,032 --> 00:32:56,532
Why?

404
00:32:56,651 --> 00:32:57,393
Just do it.

405
00:32:57,393 --> 00:32:58,162
No.

406
00:32:58,162 --> 00:32:59,608
Close your eyes, please.

407
00:32:59,608 --> 00:33:00,921
One, two, three, close them.

408
00:33:01,752 --> 00:33:02,583
Close your eyes, please.

409
00:33:03,895 --> 00:33:05,006
Alright.

410
00:33:05,449 --> 00:33:07,449
I'm going to count to three, then you can open your eyes, okay?

411
00:33:08,138 --> 00:33:09,311
Keep them shut.

412
00:33:10,016 --> 00:33:10,843
Still shut.

413
00:33:11,465 --> 00:33:12,161
Get on with it.

414
00:33:12,161 --> 00:33:12,952
I'm watching you.

415
00:33:12,952 --> 00:33:14,583
My eyes are shut, promise.

416
00:33:17,948 --> 00:33:18,621
Don’t!

417
00:33:18,865 --> 00:33:20,192
What, I’m not opening them!

418
00:33:25,466 --> 00:33:26,527
Three,

419
00:33:28,116 --> 00:33:29,275
two,

420
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:32,037
one.

421
00:33:52,126 --> 00:33:54,419
What's this all about, Joke?

422
00:33:56,256 --> 00:33:57,649
I'm bringing you a sun.

423
00:33:58,431 --> 00:34:00,016
A sun with my face on it?

424
00:34:00,461 --> 00:34:02,170
Because your face looks like the sun.

425
00:34:03,769 --> 00:34:07,993
Time for Teletubbies.

426
00:34:11,631 --> 00:34:14,218
What are you going on about? I don’t get the reference.

427
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:16,882
I'm serious here.

428
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,388
When I look at you, you make people around you happy.

429
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:24,950
They smile, laugh, and at ease.

430
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:35,196
You bring a warm and comforting vibe with you.

431
00:34:38,953 --> 00:34:40,953
That's an overstatement. Joke.

432
00:34:43,285 --> 00:34:44,535
Here’s the truth.

433
00:34:46,466 --> 00:34:53,690
I’m one of those who feels comfortable and warm around you.

434
00:34:54,802 --> 00:34:56,047
No, Joke.

435
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,566
You need to learn to generate that warmth for yourself.

436
00:35:02,357 --> 00:35:04,137
Don’t always re…

437
00:35:06,305 --> 00:35:07,685
That's the point. That's what I want to tell you.

438
00:35:10,227 --> 00:35:13,022
You need to learn to generate that warmth for yourself.

439
00:35:30,145 --> 00:35:31,681
When did you get this?

440
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:41,264
I saw this keychain at the night market, and it made me think of you.

441
00:35:44,282 --> 00:35:46,086
You do have a knack for cool lines.

442
00:35:47,117 --> 00:35:49,650
Do you imagine yourself as the hero of the TV show?

443
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:54,871
Well, aren't we all protagonists of our own shows?

444
00:36:28,236 --> 00:36:30,749
Thank you, Joke.

445
00:36:36,791 --> 00:36:37,789
Should we head back?

446
00:36:41,844 --> 00:36:42,817
Let's go.

447
00:36:56,263 --> 00:37:00,536
Bro, did you delete that video story with me and Pok in it?

448
00:37:02,586 --> 00:37:04,293
I did.

449
00:37:07,486 --> 00:37:09,070
ou're not making a big deal out of this, are you?

450
00:37:14,346 --> 00:37:15,318
I don't think so.

451
00:37:17,909 --> 00:37:20,257
Have you checked with him if he's okay with it?

452
00:37:21,527 --> 00:37:24,969
Don't worry about that. I've already talked to him.

453
00:37:24,969 --> 00:37:25,896
He understands.

454
00:37:27,681 --> 00:37:30,928
He may understand, but he may not feel okay with it.

455
00:37:39,604 --> 00:37:40,797
You should talk to him.

456
00:37:58,802 --> 00:38:00,011
You know how to grill the rice?

457
00:38:01,942 --> 00:38:02,733
Yes.

458
00:38:08,604 --> 00:38:09,727
This is yours.

459
00:38:10,216 --> 00:38:11,411
Thanks so much.

460
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:33,844
I'm sorry for all the hassle today.

461
00:38:37,173 --> 00:38:38,257
No need to apologize.

462
00:38:39,406 --> 00:38:42,009
It was my choice to help you.

463
00:38:44,745 --> 00:38:48,407
You ended up missing out on your vacation day though.

464
00:38:50,046 --> 00:38:53,024
If it were me who lost my wallet,

465
00:38:54,365 --> 00:38:56,976
I'm sure you'd have done the same for me.

466
00:38:58,271 --> 00:38:58,958
Am I right?

467
00:39:01,451 --> 00:39:02,090
But…

468
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:02,764
How about this?

469
00:39:03,538 --> 00:39:07,787
If it's bothering you, you can buy me a coffee at the club.

470
00:39:13,341 --> 00:39:14,154
This tastes amazing.

471
00:39:22,195 --> 00:39:23,039
Zo.

472
00:39:24,749 --> 00:39:29,120
I'm sorry. I should’ve told you about Jeng sooner.

473
00:39:31,377 --> 00:39:33,866
Hey, it’s fine.

474
00:39:35,642 --> 00:39:38,937
You don't have to tell me anything until you're ready.

475
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:41,122
I understand.

476
00:39:42,678 --> 00:39:44,262
I've been wanting to tell you,

477
00:39:44,544 --> 00:39:48,450
but Jeng and I are still figuring things out.

478
00:39:49,176 --> 00:39:51,811
We're not certain about our future yet.

479
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:01,190
And…

480
00:40:04,099 --> 00:40:05,570
is there something about me that’s not okay?

481
00:40:07,955 --> 00:40:08,922
Is it alright to ask?

482
00:40:09,826 --> 00:40:10,859
Not at all.

483
00:40:11,319 --> 00:40:16,252
Jeng didn’t want people to know.

484
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:22,770
He’s part of the football club with all those straight guys.

485
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:28,860
I was okay with it at first,

486
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:33,043
but then I started wanting to be open about us.

487
00:40:34,527 --> 00:40:38,850
I want to be able to go anywhere freely, like we're doing now.

488
00:40:39,409 --> 00:40:41,042
So, I'm feeling a bit uneasy.

489
00:40:43,552 --> 00:40:44,575
I get it.

490
00:40:47,166 --> 00:40:51,418
Feel free to talk to me about anything.

491
00:40:54,307 --> 00:40:54,993
Hey,

492
00:40:55,971 --> 00:40:57,358
are you two whispering about us?

493
00:40:58,862 --> 00:40:59,616
Nothing.

494
00:41:00,594 --> 00:41:01,596
You’re looking ‘suspencious.’

495
00:41:01,596 --> 00:41:02,213
Suspicious!

496
00:41:04,156 --> 00:41:07,850
Why would you think we're gossiping about you?

497
00:41:09,611 --> 00:41:14,226
Are you worried we're doing what you usually do?

498
00:41:15,377 --> 00:41:17,279
I didn't have time to gossip.

499
00:41:18,199 --> 00:41:19,881
I've been busy grilling these prawns for you, Zo.

500
00:41:20,406 --> 00:41:22,602
Are you done with yours?

501
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:24,988
Almost there.

502
00:41:24,988 --> 00:41:27,405
Should we start digging in? Okay?

503
00:41:28,434 --> 00:41:29,401
Leave them be.

504
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:35,483
Let me give you a hand.

505
00:41:37,243 --> 00:41:38,083
Go.

506
00:41:41,724 --> 00:41:43,290
Grilled rice is ready.

507
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:44,876
We're all in for some stomach trouble tonight.

508
00:41:45,701 --> 00:41:47,261
This is delicious.

509
00:41:47,261 --> 00:41:48,426
Have a taste first.

510
00:41:48,426 --> 00:41:49,843
I'm just kidding.

511
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:51,183
Here.

512
00:41:53,175 --> 00:41:55,490
Let's toast with our grilled rice.

513
00:41:58,335 --> 00:42:00,775
One for each.

514
00:42:04,906 --> 00:42:05,831
Thank you.

515
00:42:27,385 --> 00:42:27,993
Hey.

516
00:42:30,426 --> 00:42:32,083
I talked to Pok.

517
00:42:35,364 --> 00:42:36,406
Feeling better now?

518
00:42:37,556 --> 00:42:38,204
Yeah.

519
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:45,203
When did you get close with Uncle Art?

520
00:42:45,764 --> 00:42:48,339
I've never seen him let anyone borrow his guitar before.

521
00:42:49,621 --> 00:42:52,063
Oh, is he usually protective of it?

522
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,272
Indeed. It's his son's guitar.

523
00:42:58,981 --> 00:43:01,533
Maybe because I'm with you, he felt comfortable lending it to me.

524
00:43:06,228 --> 00:43:07,457
I don't think that's the only reason.

525
00:43:08,076 --> 00:43:10,550
I believe he senses a connection with you.

526
00:43:13,042 --> 00:43:14,268
I can't see that.

527
00:43:17,897 --> 00:43:22,197
Sometimes, people don't show all their cards.

528
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,216
From your perspective, what kind of person am I?

529
00:43:27,026 --> 00:43:32,233
Why, are you going to fire back with sharp words after I answer?

530
00:43:33,605 --> 00:43:34,500
I'm not a blade.

531
00:43:36,291 --> 00:43:37,396
Is that how you see me?

532
00:43:37,785 --> 00:43:39,119
Isn't that the truth?

533
00:43:40,778 --> 00:43:43,412
Just answer me. What do you think of me?

534
00:43:45,744 --> 00:43:47,180
To me,

535
00:43:51,294 --> 00:43:53,433
you seem like…

536
00:43:57,701 --> 00:43:59,311
someone who doesn’t really care about anything,

537
00:44:01,424 --> 00:44:04,287
like you’re indifferent to everything and everyone.

538
00:44:05,209 --> 00:44:06,767
As if you're just taking it one day at a time.

539
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:11,855
But that's just the surface.

540
00:44:12,852 --> 00:44:15,604
Once I got to know you,

541
00:44:17,218 --> 00:44:19,894
I realized that you're genuinely kind.

542
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:22,574
You’ve always been kind to me, you know that?

543
00:44:24,714 --> 00:44:28,749
You've always been there for me, even when it wasn't your problem.

544
00:44:33,878 --> 00:44:34,667
You know what?

545
00:44:36,724 --> 00:44:40,434
You're the first person who has called me kind.

546
00:44:48,842 --> 00:44:52,877
In your perspective, what kind of person am I?

547
00:44:53,666 --> 00:44:56,219
Am I the sun, as you said?

548
00:44:57,834 --> 00:45:00,144
Yes, you are.

549
00:45:02,113 --> 00:45:07,585
You're always smiling, bringing joy to those around you.

550
00:45:10,810 --> 00:45:12,810
But when I got to know you better,

551
00:45:14,713 --> 00:45:17,177
it feels like you want to maintain that image at all costs.

552
00:45:21,316 --> 00:45:23,340
You keep your emotions to yourself

553
00:45:25,618 --> 00:45:26,931
and maintain that smile.

554
00:45:32,092 --> 00:45:38,028
You should let yourself express your feelings sometimes.

555
00:45:39,344 --> 00:45:43,179
If you're upset, it's okay to express that.

556
00:45:44,499 --> 00:45:47,119
It's not like I’m putting on a fake smile all the time.

557
00:45:48,018 --> 00:45:52,672
I just don't want things to get too tense.

558
00:45:53,651 --> 00:45:55,651
Why do you put so much pressure on yourself?

559
00:46:01,794 --> 00:46:09,146
I don't want people to perceive me as high-maintenance or overly sensitive.

560
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:13,206
I don't want them to see me as weak.

561
00:46:16,693 --> 00:46:21,533
Expressing your feelings doesn't make you weak.

562
00:46:22,937 --> 00:46:27,281
In fact, I think it shows bravery.

563
00:46:28,429 --> 00:46:33,569
I find people who are open about their feelings pretty cool.

564
00:46:41,564 --> 00:46:42,588
I wrote a song.

565
00:46:43,738 --> 00:46:44,714
Want to hear it?

566
00:46:47,523 --> 00:46:48,253

Why did you want to come with me on this rugged trip?

578
00:48:20,396 --> 00:48:24,939
How could anyone leave you sad and alone when you're in this state?

579
00:48:25,117 --> 00:48:28,908
I just don’t want to make anyone uncomfortable.

580
00:48:29,381 --> 00:48:30,520
Look, I’m not Nita.

581
00:48:31,161 --> 00:48:32,354
I’m not Pok.

582
00:48:33,575 --> 00:48:37,322
Not everyone feels awkward around you.

583
00:48:37,588 --> 00:48:41,813
Sunset's around 6:30 p.m.

584
00:48:42,067 --> 00:48:43,039
We didn't make it.

585
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:45,394
What's this all about, Joke?

586
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:48,813

Do you think….

593
00:49:42,598 --> 00:49:46,425
if your heart races whenever you’re around someone,

594
00:49:49,339 --> 00:49:51,339
does that mean you have feelings for that person?

595
00:49:55,527 --> 00:50:00,159
Even if it was never part of your plan.

596
00:50:07,513 --> 00:50:08,714
If there was no feeling,

597
00:50:11,877 --> 00:50:13,339
your heart wouldn't react.

598
00:50:19,026 --> 00:50:23,945
You need to own up to your feelings.

599
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:41,145
Zo!

600
00:51:41,145 --> 00:51:42,020
What are you doing here?

601
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:45,088
Zo, I just tidied it up.

602
00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:46,615
Z…

603
00:51:46,615 --> 00:51:47,853
Why are you here?

604
00:51:47,853 --> 00:51:51,329
Your friend is here. Why not invite him to join us for dinner?

605
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:52,831
The sour curry is yummy.

606
00:51:52,831 --> 00:51:55,573
Zo is very talented. He's a star.

607
00:51:55,573 --> 00:51:57,161
Why did you build me up so much to my mom?

608
00:51:57,340 --> 00:52:00,136
I wasn't exaggerating. I genuinely think you're exceptional.

609
00:52:00,241 --> 00:52:02,064
I know you've been avoiding me.

610
00:52:02,199 --> 00:52:05,791
Back in Chiang Khan, when we kissed, tell me how you felt.
