1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,160
Mind if I sit here?

2
00:00:01,327 --> 00:00:01,939
Go right ahead.

3
00:00:02,372 --> 00:00:03,174
Thanks.

4
00:00:05,634 --> 00:00:07,150
I think he's back in action.

5
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:10,565
What are you up to, James?

6
00:00:11,752 --> 00:00:12,896
You set this up?

7
00:00:13,176 --> 00:00:15,816
We set this up to catch you in the act.

8
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:17,729
You stalker!

9
00:00:18,672 --> 00:00:21,692
Don't trust a stranger too easily, okay?

10
00:00:21,892 --> 00:00:25,000
If something comes up, we always talk, alright?

11
00:00:25,268 --> 00:00:26,503
You trust me, right?

12
00:00:26,887 --> 00:00:27,995
Yeah, I trust you.

13
00:00:33,243 --> 00:00:35,000
Heading home for the whole break, huh?

14
00:00:38,583 --> 00:00:42,010
Yep. Gotta sort out my military service deferment.

15
00:00:44,164 --> 00:00:45,782
Man, how will I survive without you?

16
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:48,502
It's nearly 3 months!

17
00:00:49,803 --> 00:00:52,873
Time will fly, trust me. You'll be fine.

18
00:00:55,832 --> 00:00:57,654
You'll be swamped when you're back.

19
00:00:59,496 --> 00:01:04,019
I was hoping we'd hang out more before senior year kicks off.

20
00:01:07,086 --> 00:01:13,623
Didn't you promise to spend time with your grandma this break?

21
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:17,384
That's true.

22
00:01:18,837 --> 00:01:20,493
But it'll be so lonely.

23
00:01:22,117 --> 00:01:23,234
It’s not that long.

24
00:01:24,407 --> 00:01:25,672
I'll be back soon.

25
00:01:26,901 --> 00:01:27,895
Just hang tight for me, okay?

26
00:01:31,667 --> 00:01:32,367
Fine.

27
00:01:34,264 --> 00:01:38,686
But I expect three calls a day, every day,

28
00:01:39,431 --> 00:01:41,431
and a bedtime video chat.

29
00:01:43,363 --> 00:01:46,739
I cannot go to sleep without seeing your face.

30
00:01:49,501 --> 00:01:50,237
Deal?

31
00:01:51,282 --> 00:01:54,254
Wow, someone is clingy.

32
00:02:03,021 --> 00:02:05,199
Let's grab our things and go.

33
00:02:10,728 --> 00:02:11,476
Ready to go?

34
00:02:11,935 --> 00:02:13,187
Almost, hold on a sec.

35
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:18,398
Come on.

36
00:02:19,188 --> 00:02:20,129
Let's go.

37
00:02:24,437 --> 00:02:25,080
Alright.

38
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,519
Zo, I’m off..

39
00:03:25,723 --> 00:03:26,404
See you later.

40
00:03:26,404 --> 00:03:26,904
Later.

41
00:03:31,581 --> 00:03:32,647
Have you waited too long?

42
00:03:36,063 --> 00:03:37,863
Not long at all, boyfriend.

43
00:03:38,705 --> 00:03:40,566
Here, let me hold that for you.

44
00:03:42,274 --> 00:03:42,942
Let’s go.

45
00:03:44,352 --> 00:03:47,346
Jeng and Pok are over there. Let’s go see them.

46
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,063
How's studying going?

47
00:03:58,955 --> 00:04:00,547
Horrible!

48
00:04:00,829 --> 00:04:04,562
Ms. Waree switched up the exam questions this semester.

49
00:04:05,001 --> 00:04:07,400
Your notes are a lifesaver, Zo.

50
00:04:08,766 --> 00:04:10,129
Just give them back when you're done.

51
00:04:13,903 --> 00:04:14,867
What about you, Jeng?

52
00:04:15,326 --> 00:04:17,101
Don't you have to study for exams as well?

53
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:21,471
Of course, I do. I just stopped by to see Pok.

54
00:04:26,609 --> 00:04:29,348
Zo, do you have notes for—

55
00:04:33,823 --> 00:04:35,364
Who keeps blowing up your phone?

56
00:04:37,082 --> 00:04:41,631
Some high school kid looking for study advice.

57
00:04:43,995 --> 00:04:46,520
The one who asked for your IG at the open house?

58
00:04:47,378 --> 00:04:49,888
That's her. I just gave her a courtesy reply.

59
00:04:51,133 --> 00:04:52,878
And why'd you give her your IG in the first place?

60
00:04:53,185 --> 00:04:55,480
She asked, I answered.

61
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:59,519
She goes to our alma mater, so I didn't think too much of it.

62
00:05:00,001 --> 00:05:01,246
Just offering some advice.

63
00:05:01,628 --> 00:05:02,638
Didn't think too much of it?

64
00:05:03,565 --> 00:05:05,922
I bet you didn't think much about how I’d feel about it either.

65
00:05:09,681 --> 00:05:10,512
Pok!

66
00:05:11,681 --> 00:05:13,487
Didn't you say you were fine with this?

67
00:05:13,487 --> 00:05:14,715
I was at first,

68
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:17,052
but now I'm not.

69
00:05:17,052 --> 00:05:19,809
Hey, be reasonable.

70
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,330
She’s just asking about school.

71
00:05:22,597 --> 00:05:26,126
And both of us are her seniors.

72
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:27,404
It's obvious she’s into you.

73
00:05:27,404 --> 00:05:29,154
But I’m not into her.

74
00:05:30,201 --> 00:05:32,201
How would you feel if you were in my shoes?

75
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:36,322
Your boyfriend has an admirer, and she keeps texting him.

76
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,000
Should I feel good about that?

77
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,725
Pok,

78
00:05:40,353 --> 00:05:43,520
just chill. Don't be silly.

79
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,904
Yeah, I'm silly. Do you regret being with me?

80
00:05:48,086 --> 00:05:50,698
Pok, easy.

81
00:05:51,448 --> 00:05:53,295
You guys should talk it out.

82
00:06:00,663 --> 00:06:02,051
Don't overthink.

83
00:06:17,103 --> 00:06:18,619
I don't see a future.

84
00:06:24,151 --> 00:06:29,337
We keep on hiding like this?

85
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:39,011
How can a couple have a secret relationship that goes on and on?

86
00:06:42,784 --> 00:06:50,901
Or he’s not serious about me anyway.

87
00:06:55,668 --> 00:06:56,954
It's going to be okay.

88
00:06:59,556 --> 00:07:02,270
I'm here for you, no matter what.

89
00:07:17,341 --> 00:07:20,819
Jeng! Jeng! Just try to relax.

90
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:21,790
What?

91
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:25,569
You can't be like this.

92
00:07:26,464 --> 00:07:27,529
What did I do?

93
00:07:28,345 --> 00:07:30,068
I haven't done anything.

94
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:32,606
Let's sit down for a bit.

95
00:07:35,477 --> 00:07:36,497
Try to calm down.

96
00:07:39,403 --> 00:07:40,483
You did something.

97
00:07:42,344 --> 00:07:43,850
I was going to tell you off about this.

98
00:07:45,001 --> 00:07:47,001
Although you don't plan on dating her,

99
00:07:47,755 --> 00:07:49,882
you can't just go around acting like you're single.

100
00:07:51,818 --> 00:07:58,381
Although I tell everyone I'm single, I don't flirt.

101
00:07:58,869 --> 00:08:01,139
This is not a big deal.

102
00:08:01,572 --> 00:08:03,246
Pok just doesn't trust me.

103
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:08,736
If he didn't trust you,

104
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,603
would he let you keep your relationship a secret all this time?

105
00:08:20,119 --> 00:08:20,895
Jeng,

106
00:08:22,348 --> 00:08:23,738
Pok is your boyfriend.

107
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,249
You need to listen to him.

108
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:31,487
And you've been the one acting silly,

109
00:08:32,635 --> 00:08:34,890
and he's been putting up with you all along.

110
00:08:41,406 --> 00:08:43,533
I'm not saying you should do whatever he wants all the time.

111
00:08:45,001 --> 00:08:48,658
But if you guys have a problem, you need to talk it out,

112
00:08:49,349 --> 00:08:51,222
not turn your backs on each other like this.

113
00:08:53,004 --> 00:08:54,015
Be careful.

114
00:08:55,315 --> 00:08:59,006
You may regret it when you turn around one day and he won’t be there.

115
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:40,089
Let me recharge for a sec.

116
00:09:44,575 --> 00:09:45,431
Worn out?

117
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,124
Aren't you?

118
00:09:49,449 --> 00:09:53,919
For sure. Still got a lot to do. I don't even know if I can finish.

119
00:09:56,724 --> 00:09:57,699
Rest if you need to.

120
00:10:01,675 --> 00:10:02,700
Rest, you say?

121
00:10:21,345 --> 00:10:22,534
Let me recharge for a sec.

122
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:36,280
I see a knot between your eyebrows.

123
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,735
You can be a masseuse.

124
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:41,456
You're exaggerating.

125
00:10:44,792 --> 00:10:46,588
Now I'm relaxed.

126
00:10:48,654 --> 00:10:49,751
What are you smiling about?

127
00:10:57,551 --> 00:11:03,438
I'm happy that I have a sweet boyfriend.

128
00:11:09,414 --> 00:11:10,531
You sure do.

129
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,233
Cuz my boyfriend is the best.

130
00:11:18,857 --> 00:11:19,691
Let's hit the books again.

131
00:11:22,928 --> 00:11:24,094
But I gotta use the bathroom first.

132
00:11:25,341 --> 00:11:26,363
Go ahead.

133
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:27,877
I'll be right back.

134
00:11:31,829 --> 00:11:33,651
Be quick, or we’ll run out of time.

135
00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:34,659
Will do.

136
00:11:54,762 --> 00:11:56,762
[Pat: You still owe me for the Chiang Khan tip on Zo.]

137
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
[Pat: If you need more help, make it worth my while.]

138
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,103
[Pat: He goes there every year, but quite early this year.]
[Joke: Are you sure? It’s so sudden.]

139
00:12:22,103 --> 00:12:23,366
[Pat: He told me himself. Just go to his place.]
[Pat: If you leave now, he might still be there.]

140
00:12:23,366 --> 00:12:24,760
[Joke: I don’t want him to leave.]
[Joke: Where is his place? I might make it.]

141
00:12:31,058 --> 00:12:33,600
[Pat: Zo is leaving for Chiang Khan today.]
[Joke: Chiang Khan? Seriously? He was just with me.]
[Pat: He just texted.]

142
00:12:37,072 --> 00:12:39,387
[Pat: Zo is moving forward with Nita.]
[Joke: Did you tell him about me and Nita?]

143
00:12:39,387 --> 00:12:41,111
[Pat: I did, but not sure if he’ll go to you.]

144
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,286
[Joke: Why not?]
[Pat: Cuz you’re not exactly polite.]

145
00:12:46,286 --> 00:12:47,433
[Joke: Just get him to come to me. I’ll handle the rest.]
[Pat: Oh, sure. Seems like you don’t need my help.]

146
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:03,785
Was I gone too long?

147
00:13:06,691 --> 00:13:08,260
You were in there for a while.

148
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,367
Minor stomach issue.

149
00:13:16,459 --> 00:13:20,324
Hey, I'm going to study with Pat and the gang tomorrow.

150
00:13:21,809 --> 00:13:22,965
Do you want to come hang out with us?

151
00:13:24,469 --> 00:13:27,301
You and Pat seem close.

152
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,724
Sure, I can.

153
00:13:33,695 --> 00:13:35,950
I just don't want to disturb you all.

154
00:13:39,112 --> 00:13:39,947
You won’t be.

155
00:13:41,527 --> 00:13:42,692
I don't see how you can disturb us.

156
00:13:50,647 --> 00:13:55,604
You and Pat seem tight lately.

157
00:13:57,123 --> 00:13:58,296
You got close pretty quickly.

158
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:00,932
Why?

159
00:14:03,084 --> 00:14:06,380
I don’t know. Because he’s your friend, maybe?

160
00:14:13,324 --> 00:14:14,543
Ask your friend.

161
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:16,751
Just talk to him.

162
00:14:21,967 --> 00:14:22,872
I don't think…

163
00:14:26,237 --> 00:14:27,332
I need to ask.

164
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,430
What do your notes say?

165
00:15:06,055 --> 00:15:08,055
[Pat: Why aren't you studying with Park?]

166
00:15:11,698 --> 00:15:13,698
[Joke: Zo invited me.]

167
00:15:16,915 --> 00:15:18,915
[Joke: He mentioned you yesterday. It’s odd.]

168
00:15:32,022 --> 00:15:32,781
Who are you texting?

169
00:15:35,292 --> 00:15:40,465
Just checking with Park about the exam.

170
00:15:44,512 --> 00:15:46,944
Guys, I found it.

171
00:15:48,063 --> 00:15:49,734
I think the exams will be on this.

172
00:15:50,637 --> 00:15:51,432
What’s the title?

173
00:15:52,482 --> 00:15:56,548
Oh, this one. I’ll get it. I remember where it is.

174
00:15:57,276 --> 00:15:58,115
But I've got it right here.

175
00:15:58,712 --> 00:15:59,873
We should get one extra copy, just to be safe.

176
00:16:16,298 --> 00:16:16,907
Pat!

177
00:16:21,209 --> 00:16:22,065
Why’d you jump?

178
00:16:23,203 --> 00:16:25,697
You snuck up on me. Of course, I jumped.

179
00:16:26,667 --> 00:16:31,014
So you didn’t jump because I showed up instead of Joke?

180
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:35,475
Zo, what are you talking about? Why would I wait for Joke to show up?

181
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:38,738
I didn’t say anything about you waiting for Joke.

182
00:16:51,137 --> 00:16:52,701
I know everything,

183
00:16:53,895 --> 00:16:56,371
and I’ll give you only one chance.

184
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:02,881
What's going on between you and Joke?

185
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,634
Joke and I…

186
00:17:16,187 --> 00:17:19,278
How'd you end up falling down the stairs and messing up your tendon?

187
00:17:20,259 --> 00:17:23,160
Your boyfriend's the reason.

188
00:17:26,182 --> 00:17:27,147
Joke,

189
00:17:28,182 --> 00:17:30,760
Zo said he's onto us.

190
00:17:32,688 --> 00:17:33,844
Onto what now?

191
00:17:42,636 --> 00:17:43,874
I sorted out your insurance.

192
00:17:44,744 --> 00:17:46,518
Kot will take you home.

193
00:17:49,504 --> 00:17:51,710
You and I still have things to discuss.

194
00:17:55,093 --> 00:17:56,139
Discuss what?

195
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:57,464
Why am I out of the loop?

196
00:17:59,181 --> 00:18:00,080
I’ll fill you in.

197
00:18:01,731 --> 00:18:02,740
You dodged a bullet today.

198
00:18:04,868 --> 00:18:08,679
You and I will need to finish this conversation at your place.

199
00:18:30,614 --> 00:18:33,190
What the heck is going on? Tell me.

200
00:18:44,001 --> 00:18:44,559
Zo.

201
00:18:49,479 --> 00:18:50,286
What’s going on?

202
00:18:51,912 --> 00:18:56,232
On the way here, you didn’t once look at me or talk to me.

203
00:18:58,176 --> 00:18:59,031
What's the matter?

204
00:19:00,176 --> 00:19:01,239
When were you planning on telling me?

205
00:19:02,592 --> 00:19:03,311
Telling you what?

206
00:19:04,484 --> 00:19:06,321
I've given you plenty of chances.

207
00:19:07,697 --> 00:19:09,326
When will you come clean?

208
00:19:11,301 --> 00:19:13,651
Look, I don't even know what you're getting at.

209
00:19:14,905 --> 00:19:18,128
Just spill it so we can talk it out.

210
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,107
Yeah?

211
00:19:20,177 --> 00:19:21,645
So you can talk your way out of it?

212
00:19:22,126 --> 00:19:23,179
What's your deal?

213
00:19:24,801 --> 00:19:25,964
Can you just chill?

214
00:19:26,602 --> 00:19:28,818
I'm totally in the dark here.

215
00:19:28,818 --> 00:19:29,370
If you could just–

216
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:30,975
You've been playing me all this time.

217
00:19:33,857 --> 00:19:34,932
Do I look like a fool to you?

218
00:19:37,261 --> 00:19:38,186
You're overreacting.

219
00:19:38,186 --> 00:19:41,888
When would you have told me if I hadn't found out?

220
00:19:44,464 --> 00:19:45,661
How should I be feeling?

221
00:19:46,903 --> 00:19:49,000
My best friend pimping me out to you!

222
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:53,938
Let's just calm down.

223
00:19:54,185 --> 00:19:56,501
It's not all that bad.

224
00:19:58,122 --> 00:20:00,320
I did it to make this moment possible.

225
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:05,148
This “moment” started with a lie.

226
00:20:06,304 --> 00:20:09,971
You know that I hate being manipulated.

227
00:20:11,775 --> 00:20:14,742
First Puen, now you.

228
00:20:16,425 --> 00:20:17,828
You were the one who said we should always talk things out.

229
00:20:18,555 --> 00:20:20,061
I never thought you'd find out.

230
00:20:20,809 --> 00:20:22,603
And I wasn't manipulating you.

231
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,141
Look, it wasn't even a bad thing.

232
00:20:28,005 --> 00:20:29,593
I was just trying to get close to you.

233
00:20:29,703 --> 00:20:31,703
So you don't think you're wrong?

234
00:20:33,461 --> 00:20:35,235
How am I supposed to trust you then?

235
00:20:38,472 --> 00:20:42,592
Why did our relationship have to start with a lie?

236
00:20:58,362 --> 00:20:59,168
You!

237
00:21:12,655 --> 00:21:16,137
Lying is normal.

238
00:21:17,365 --> 00:21:21,815
Sometimes the truth does more harm than good,

239
00:21:23,716 --> 00:21:25,387
especially in relationships.

240
00:21:27,884 --> 00:21:31,387
A white lie can even save a relationship

241
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:36,465
if it spares someone pain from learning the truth.

242
00:21:36,994 --> 00:21:45,642
My team doesn't think a white lie is wrong.

243
00:21:47,834 --> 00:21:59,797
But, for me, using a white lie, as an excuse to keep someone happy,

244
00:22:01,446 --> 00:22:07,731
or to hide something that you do behind someone’s back?

245
00:22:09,687 --> 00:22:11,163
That's wrong.

246
00:22:11,907 --> 00:22:12,651
Thank you.

247
00:22:14,601 --> 00:22:15,607
Zo, what are you doing?

248
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:17,342
We're supposed to be on the Affirmative side.

249
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:19,969
I just wanted to say it.

250
00:22:27,707 --> 00:22:28,802
Who's voting for the Affirmative?

251
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,585
And the Negative?

252
00:22:39,429 --> 00:22:40,291
I agree.

253
00:22:45,499 --> 00:22:46,966
Do you know why your team lost?

254
00:22:52,172 --> 00:22:56,230
I know the debate topic puts the Affirmative at a disadvantage.

255
00:22:57,585 --> 00:23:01,643
But I think your team could do better

256
00:23:02,177 --> 00:23:05,453
at finding an angle to rebut the Negative’s arguments.

257
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:12,690
Zo,

258
00:23:14,995 --> 00:23:19,821
during the competition, you may get a debate topic that doesn’t align with your beliefs.

259
00:23:20,582 --> 00:23:23,055
You are an experienced debater. You should have known better.

260
00:23:25,736 --> 00:23:29,753
Your big problem is that you don’t believe in your own words.

261
00:23:32,445 --> 00:23:34,000
You should get a fresh perspective

262
00:23:34,761 --> 00:23:39,211
so that you can support your own argument

263
00:23:42,128 --> 00:23:44,581
even if you don’t believe in it, okay?

264
00:23:49,665 --> 00:23:50,298
Understood.

265
00:24:45,428 --> 00:24:48,858
[Let’s make up.]

266
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:50,886
For you.

267
00:24:52,251 --> 00:24:54,441
Remember you made it for me in Chiang Khan.

268
00:24:55,922 --> 00:24:56,649
I made it myself.

269
00:25:01,763 --> 00:25:02,421
Zo,

270
00:25:04,938 --> 00:25:06,097
I’m asking for your forgiveness.

271
00:25:07,708 --> 00:25:08,695
Will you forgive me?

272
00:25:09,863 --> 00:25:10,775
Please?

273
00:25:13,635 --> 00:25:14,407
Zo.

274
00:25:18,034 --> 00:25:20,034
[Let’s make up.]

275
00:25:22,195 --> 00:25:23,118
You're not going to eat?

276
00:25:24,907 --> 00:25:26,709
You'll need fuel for studying.

277
00:25:28,567 --> 00:25:29,721
Only a bite.

278
00:25:31,211 --> 00:25:32,647
Please, just a bite.

279
00:25:44,507 --> 00:25:45,401
Zo,

280
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:48,681
just one bite.

281
00:26:00,235 --> 00:26:02,235
[Let’s make up.]

282
00:26:12,398 --> 00:26:13,995
Why do you look so sad?

283
00:26:18,133 --> 00:26:19,066
I am sad too.

284
00:26:24,133 --> 00:26:29,777
Grilled Rice, tell me, what should I do?

285
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:51,064
[This is hard.]

286
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:00,688
[Joke, Joke.]

287
00:27:42,933 --> 00:27:43,906
How’d it go?

288
00:27:48,478 --> 00:27:51,606
Zo, don’t stress. Let’s eat. Dessert’s on me.

289
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:53,159
No, thanks.

290
00:27:54,287 --> 00:27:55,384
I’d rather hit the books.

291
00:27:56,941 --> 00:27:57,920
Let me join you.

292
00:27:59,128 --> 00:27:59,766
Sure.

293
00:28:14,226 --> 00:28:15,528
Hey, where did Zo go?

294
00:28:16,515 --> 00:28:17,535
Studying.

295
00:28:18,478 --> 00:28:22,250
I think he's really mad at us this time.

296
00:28:25,755 --> 00:28:28,842
Guess we need a grand gesture then.

297
00:28:31,535 --> 00:28:34,320
Whatever will be, will be.

298
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:37,754
Zo, gotta answer this text real quick.

299
00:28:38,741 --> 00:28:39,306
Go ahead.

300
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:42,790
[Pat: Are you with Zo?]

301
00:28:42,891 --> 00:28:44,352
[Kot: Yes, what’s up?]

302
00:28:44,352 --> 00:28:46,524
[Kot: Why aren’t you studying with us?]

303
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:50,354
[Kot: The last exam is tomorrow.]

304
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:55,025
[Pat: Bring Zo to Room B211.]

305
00:29:00,316 --> 00:29:00,956
[Kot: Why?]

306
00:29:00,956 --> 00:29:02,537
[Pat: He forgot something.]

307
00:29:02,537 --> 00:29:04,662
[Pat: Bring him here now.]

308
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,628
Zo,

309
00:29:08,273 --> 00:29:10,873
did you forget something with Pat?

310
00:29:13,888 --> 00:29:16,291
Something? What thing?

311
00:29:17,513 --> 00:29:21,144
I don’t know, but you may want to check it out.

312
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:27,554
Fine, but why?

313
00:29:28,578 --> 00:29:31,967
Let’s just go. Pat wants you there.

314
00:29:31,968 --> 00:29:33,968
I think it’s weird.

315
00:29:33,968 --> 00:29:35,016

What's this all about?

331
00:31:57,284 --> 00:31:58,403
This is ridiculous.

332
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:26,042
Bro, Zo is still mad at you despite all this.

333
00:32:27,994 --> 00:32:32,169
I see this work in movies every time.

334
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:36,601
Let me ask you honestly.

335
00:32:38,212 --> 00:32:41,377
You think this will get you back on his good side?

336
00:32:43,012 --> 00:32:46,260
Zo is mad because you lied to him.

337
00:32:47,421 --> 00:32:50,669
But your apology is another lie?

338
00:32:52,054 --> 00:32:53,108
Enough already.

339
00:33:24,907 --> 00:33:25,608
Pok,

340
00:33:27,878 --> 00:33:29,081
where are you going?

341
00:33:33,532 --> 00:33:35,148
I'm moving back to my old place.

342
00:33:38,854 --> 00:33:42,708
Can you please not do this? Let’s talk it out.

343
00:33:45,714 --> 00:33:46,737
What’s left to talk about?

344
00:33:47,714 --> 00:33:49,618
You walked away from me.

345
00:33:50,886 --> 00:33:54,676
I came back, didn’t I? Even brought you flowers.

346
00:34:01,963 --> 00:34:03,064
Jeng, stop it.

347
00:34:05,616 --> 00:34:06,579
I’m too tired.

348
00:34:13,823 --> 00:34:15,157
I’m sorry, Pok.

349
00:34:16,276 --> 00:34:18,956
I know I messed up.

350
00:34:19,484 --> 00:34:24,330
But I promise, no more giving out my IG, no more talking to others.

351
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:25,527
I promise, Pok.

352
00:34:25,749 --> 00:34:27,749
The problem isn’t IG.

353
00:34:31,232 --> 00:34:34,383
The problem is, I don't know where I fit in your damn life!

354
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:39,619
You are my boyfriend.

355
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:40,711
Am I?

356
00:34:42,022 --> 00:34:46,132
I may have felt good about this word in the past.

357
00:34:47,425 --> 00:34:50,480
But now, I don’t think this is enough anymore.

358
00:34:52,987 --> 00:34:54,124
Pok.

359
00:34:55,141 --> 00:34:57,429
We talked about this.

360
00:34:59,058 --> 00:35:06,330
You were okay with us not going public.

361
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:11,769
I’m sorry for being a man.

362
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:13,436
Pok.

363
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,632
I didn’t mean it like that.

364
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:19,102
I know you understand me.

365
00:35:20,439 --> 00:35:21,704
I know.

366
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,664
I’ve been so understanding.

367
00:35:26,937 --> 00:35:28,578
Even though I’m not fine with it,

368
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:31,605
I try to be.

369
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:44,275
It kills me to see others talking to you, flirting with you,

370
00:35:46,284 --> 00:35:47,900
and all I can do is stand there and watch.

371
00:36:03,758 --> 00:36:06,749
We don’t get to act like a normal couple.

372
00:36:13,933 --> 00:36:22,039
I can’t even show up to see you without hiding.

373
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,008
I keep asking myself,

374
00:36:34,953 --> 00:36:37,081
what am I to you, really?

375
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:38,790
Pok,

376
00:36:41,507 --> 00:36:42,579
Pok.

377
00:36:42,756 --> 00:36:43,731
Let go.

378
00:36:43,731 --> 00:36:44,404
Pok.

379
00:36:55,252 --> 00:36:59,458
I love you, so I’ve been patient.

380
00:37:04,802 --> 00:37:06,250
But no more.

381
00:37:12,331 --> 00:37:13,340
Let go!

382
00:37:13,882 --> 00:37:15,179
Let go of me!

383
00:37:18,509 --> 00:37:19,710
Pok.

384
00:37:25,343 --> 00:37:28,174
Let go of me!

385
00:37:31,945 --> 00:37:33,338
Pok.

386
00:37:35,225 --> 00:37:37,321
I’m so sorry.

387
00:37:46,196 --> 00:37:49,603
I was blind to how my selfishness hurt you.

388
00:37:52,791 --> 00:37:54,791
I need you in my life.

389
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:58,420
I can’t survive without you.

390
00:38:03,022 --> 00:38:05,214
You are my everything.

391
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:12,730
I promise I’ll make this right.

392
00:38:14,372 --> 00:38:16,628
I will fix this for you.

393
00:38:19,758 --> 00:38:20,671
Please.

394
00:38:32,276 --> 00:38:33,363
I’m sorry.

395
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,833
What's going on?

396
00:38:41,453 --> 00:38:42,910
Why'd you bring me here?

397
00:38:43,051 --> 00:38:44,930
I wanted to clear the air.

398
00:38:46,328 --> 00:38:52,292
Jeng, you're late. Who's this guy?

399
00:38:54,719 --> 00:38:57,210
We are…

400
00:38:59,531 --> 00:39:00,796
He’s my boyfriend.

401
00:39:05,757 --> 00:39:08,300
Oh, don’t tell me you…

402
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:10,423
Yeah,

403
00:39:11,286 --> 00:39:12,665
I’m dating a guy.

404
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:17,142
You keep nagging me about being single.

405
00:39:20,562 --> 00:39:23,090
Well, meet my boyfriend.

406
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:26,561
Ah, so this is the guy?

407
00:39:29,054 --> 00:39:29,906
Cool.

408
00:39:29,906 --> 00:39:35,014
I have to get back to practice. Catch you later.

409
00:39:45,645 --> 00:39:46,884
It’s alright.

410
00:39:48,163 --> 00:39:50,855
No need to worry.

411
00:39:53,501 --> 00:39:55,181
You didn't have to do that.

412
00:39:55,181 --> 00:39:56,352
It’s okay.

413
00:39:56,782 --> 00:39:58,686
I want this out in the open.

414
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:06,090
Don’t mind them. Focus on me!

415
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:07,821
This isn’t funny.

416
00:40:25,691 --> 00:40:26,509
You good?

417
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:29,193
Yeah.

418
00:40:29,704 --> 00:40:30,905
Where’s your exam room?

419
00:40:31,671 --> 00:40:32,788
Next to yours.

420
00:40:35,122 --> 00:40:36,930
I’ll walk you to the elevator.

421
00:40:37,858 --> 00:40:39,193
Thanks.

422
00:40:39,545 --> 00:40:40,913
Slowly.

423
00:40:46,769 --> 00:40:48,034
Zo, look.

424
00:40:52,356 --> 00:40:53,653
I’m sorry.

425
00:40:57,303 --> 00:40:59,111
I have no excuse.

426
00:41:01,092 --> 00:41:06,928
I was helping Joke get close to you, that's all.

427
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:13,676
When you started dating, I did nothing to influence either of you.

428
00:41:15,433 --> 00:41:21,653
But it was wrong to keep it from you, to go behind your back.

429
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:26,283
I was supposed to be a friend you could trust.

430
00:41:27,376 --> 00:41:28,769
I’m really sorry, Zo.

431
00:41:35,828 --> 00:41:38,595
Let’s get to the exam.

432
00:41:39,793 --> 00:41:41,154
I’ll pick you up afterward.

433
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:45,646
We’re running late. See you later.

434
00:41:45,646 --> 00:41:48,456
Hey, I thought you were going to help me?

435
00:41:48,825 --> 00:41:50,345
Just messing with you. Come on.

436
00:42:19,346 --> 00:42:20,259
What are you doing here?

437
00:42:21,346 --> 00:42:22,561
I'm here to win you back.

438
00:42:26,582 --> 00:42:28,262
Can you please give me one last chance?

439
00:42:29,476 --> 00:42:30,243
No!

440
00:42:31,969 --> 00:42:32,978
Zo!

441
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,480
You can still be angry with me,

442
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:45,374
but I don’t want to make you uncomfortable.

443
00:42:48,538 --> 00:42:54,086
Please, one more chance, for the last time. Please?

444
00:42:57,698 --> 00:42:58,773
Your words.

445
00:43:21,563 --> 00:43:24,522
Let me make you chrysanthemum juice.

446
00:43:48,357 --> 00:43:51,700
Zo, is this too much?

447
00:44:03,277 --> 00:44:04,572
Chrysanthemum Flowers,

448
00:44:05,499 --> 00:44:07,323
Zo doesn’t talk to me.

449
00:44:07,825 --> 00:44:09,569
Do you feel sorry for me?

450
00:44:12,194 --> 00:44:14,450
Zo isn’t easy to break.

451
00:44:15,478 --> 00:44:23,360
If this is the last day we’re together, as he said, I’d be devastated.

452
00:44:24,331 --> 00:44:26,331
Chrysanthemum Flowers, can you please help me?

453
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:30,330
Tell me what I should do.

454
00:44:37,454 --> 00:44:42,330
Chrysanthemum Flowers, you know why I like Zo?

455
00:44:47,436 --> 00:44:48,458
Don’t you want to know?

456
00:44:50,905 --> 00:44:54,759
You will hear me out, nevertheless,

457
00:44:56,401 --> 00:45:03,995
because today might be the last day I can say how I feel about Zo.

458
00:45:08,906 --> 00:45:16,277
When I was a freshman, this person came up to me.

459
00:45:20,657 --> 00:45:21,614
Want some water?

460
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:32,206
You’re Joke, right?

461
00:45:33,253 --> 00:45:34,268
Who are you?

462
00:45:35,763 --> 00:45:37,283
Here to make me join that contest?

463
00:45:38,994 --> 00:45:41,505
No, I’m your classmate.

464
00:45:42,495 --> 00:45:44,111
I’m Zo from IR.

465
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:47,103
So? What’s up?

466
00:45:48,031 --> 00:45:53,420
I saw the seniors trying to push you into the Freshy Prince/Princess contest.

467
00:45:55,824 --> 00:45:59,422
You really don't want to do it, do you?

468
00:46:00,151 --> 00:46:02,311
Not one bit.

469
00:46:03,494 --> 00:46:04,520
Why’s that?

470
00:46:06,156 --> 00:46:07,900
I don’t like all these complicated activities.

471
00:46:09,305 --> 00:46:12,584
The seniors are annoying, trying to make me join.

472
00:46:13,817 --> 00:46:14,828
You’re right.

473
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:18,330
You okay?

474
00:46:22,184 --> 00:46:23,930
I’m fine.

475
00:46:25,049 --> 00:46:26,159
What’s it to you?

476
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:30,282
It matters.

477
00:46:30,953 --> 00:46:34,061
No one should be forced to do anything.

478
00:46:39,676 --> 00:46:44,265
I can help.

479
00:46:48,763 --> 00:46:50,475
I'll join the contest in your place.

480
00:46:56,196 --> 00:47:02,799
You see, he was the first person to actually ask what I wanted to do.

481
00:47:04,272 --> 00:47:08,254
He listened without judging.

482
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:14,162
That's why I want to keep him in my life.

483
00:47:20,235 --> 00:47:21,581
When I’m with him,

484
00:47:23,595 --> 00:47:25,272
I feel like I don’t need to be anyone else.

485
00:47:28,676 --> 00:47:29,941
I can just be myself.

486
00:47:34,127 --> 00:47:35,792
At first, I was confused,

487
00:47:39,117 --> 00:47:40,533
not sure if he’d like me.

488
00:47:45,136 --> 00:47:46,579
And he was into Nita back then.

489
00:47:51,662 --> 00:47:56,362
So I figured, knowing him was enough.

490
00:48:00,924 --> 00:48:02,492
But as I got to know him,

491
00:48:08,167 --> 00:48:09,229
I couldn't help myself.

492
00:48:13,842 --> 00:48:15,278
My heart just wasn't mine anymore.

493
00:48:19,977 --> 00:48:21,971
So I wanted to pursue him for real.

494
00:48:27,357 --> 00:48:33,960
There's nothing untrue between us.

495
00:48:38,063 --> 00:48:42,118
My feelings are real.

496
00:48:44,707 --> 00:48:46,360
They’ve always been real.

497
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:55,210
Everything I've done,

498
00:49:00,645 --> 00:49:02,345
it's because I want to be next to him.

499
00:49:09,759 --> 00:49:10,928
I love him.

500
00:49:29,721 --> 00:49:30,880
I’m so sorry, Zo.

501
00:49:33,405 --> 00:49:34,757
Really sorry.

502
00:49:36,131 --> 00:49:40,273
I've done you wrong all this time,

503
00:49:43,368 --> 00:49:45,016
but I never apologized.

504
00:49:46,371 --> 00:49:48,627
You don't have to forgive me for this.

505
00:49:50,767 --> 00:49:59,896
But I promise that I won’t lie to you or hide anything from you again.

506
00:50:05,883 --> 00:50:07,352
You may not believe me now,

507
00:50:10,197 --> 00:50:11,975
but I’ll prove it to you.

508
00:50:31,483 --> 00:50:32,876
That wasn't hard, was it?

509
00:50:33,705 --> 00:50:38,550
I waited for your apology so long I began to believe it would never come.

510
00:50:41,084 --> 00:50:43,626
So you've forgiven me, right?

511
00:50:51,873 --> 00:50:59,212
Chrysanthemum Flowers, do you think I should forgive Joke?

512
00:51:00,663 --> 00:51:01,829
Zo,

513
00:51:02,663 --> 00:51:03,849
I’m serious here.

514
00:51:05,455 --> 00:51:10,108
So was I. You were talking to the flowers too.

515
00:51:11,327 --> 00:51:12,330
What was I supposed to do?

516
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:14,382
You weren’t speaking to me.

517
00:51:16,657 --> 00:51:21,214
Now that you are, you’ve forgiven me, haven’t you?

518
00:51:28,687 --> 00:51:29,661
Fine,

519
00:51:31,291 --> 00:51:32,573
you’re forgiven.

520
00:51:35,778 --> 00:51:40,431
But be straight with me from now on.

521
00:51:41,707 --> 00:51:45,977
No more silence, no more hiding, no more secrets.

522
00:51:47,268 --> 00:51:51,825
Most importantly, don’t ever let me experience pain over something similar again.

523
00:51:53,775 --> 00:51:54,815
Got it?

524
00:51:56,546 --> 00:51:57,539
Okay,

525
00:51:57,539 --> 00:52:00,816
let me find a notebook and a pen to jot this down so I won’t make the same mistake again.

526
00:52:01,559 --> 00:52:02,930
Are you teasing me?

527
00:52:03,781 --> 00:52:05,781
First, sort out these chrysanthemums you brought.

528
00:52:06,036 --> 00:52:07,684
There’s a lot. What are we going to do with it?

529
00:52:10,656 --> 00:52:14,222
I knew I’d mess up the juice.

530
00:52:15,091 --> 00:52:16,580
That’s why I brought this.

531
00:52:21,148 --> 00:52:22,509
You can’t make it, so you buy it.

532
00:52:41,149 --> 00:52:42,669
Trust me, it's not spiked.

533
00:52:54,114 --> 00:52:55,475
I promise.

534
00:52:57,327 --> 00:52:59,327
I’ll earn back your trust.

535
00:53:05,373 --> 00:53:06,203
Is it sweet?

536
00:53:08,568 --> 00:53:09,930
Super sweet.

537
00:53:11,430 --> 00:53:13,046
Anything sweeter than that?

538
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:31,210
Absolutely no lip contact for a month.

539
00:53:34,437 --> 00:53:35,894
One month?

540
00:53:37,810 --> 00:53:40,066
But we just made up.

541
00:53:41,845 --> 00:53:45,667
They call it a “diplomatic downgrade.”

542
00:53:46,195 --> 00:53:50,049
If you have a problem, I’ll shut down the embassy entirely.

543
00:53:53,969 --> 00:53:58,207
If you want our lips to touch, take the indirect route.

544
00:54:09,949 --> 00:54:11,006
One month, huh?

545
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:12,330
One month.

546
00:54:14,103 --> 00:54:15,370
Fine.

547
00:54:15,370 --> 00:54:17,127
What are you doing?

548
00:54:19,571 --> 00:54:20,447
No!

549
00:54:22,205 --> 00:54:23,610
One year.

550
00:54:23,610 --> 00:54:24,726
One year?

551
00:54:47,524 --> 00:54:51,090
Nicely done. I thought you’d forgotten how to handle this.

552
00:54:51,181 --> 00:54:53,010
How could I forget?

553
00:54:53,148 --> 00:54:55,014
What’s wrong?

554
00:54:55,330 --> 00:54:56,487
Just missing my boyfriend.

555
00:54:58,610 --> 00:54:59,552
What are you doing here?

556
00:54:59,552 --> 00:55:00,802
I was worried about my boy–

557
00:55:02,317 --> 00:55:03,933
Your parents seemed okay.

558
00:55:04,290 --> 00:55:05,610
Why can’t we just tell them?

559
00:55:05,739 --> 00:55:08,123
I want to wait until the debate competition is over.

560
00:55:08,123 --> 00:55:09,305
Happy birthday.

561
00:55:09,564 --> 00:55:10,574
Thanks, Zo.

562
00:55:11,117 --> 00:55:13,226
You didn’t have to get me anything.

563
00:55:13,838 --> 00:55:17,330
You're already the best gift I could ever ask for.
