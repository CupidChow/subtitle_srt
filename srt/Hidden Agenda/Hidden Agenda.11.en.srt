1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:04,797
And what about that debate club? Entered any competitions?

2
00:00:04,797 --> 00:00:06,617
Your mom's pretty intense, huh?

3
00:00:06,617 --> 00:00:08,877
I want to win the debate competition.

4
00:00:08,877 --> 00:00:11,037
I want to make her proud of me.

5
00:00:11,037 --> 00:00:16,281
And the winner of this debate is…

6
00:00:16,281 --> 00:00:19,114
the Affirmative team from Bandit Apiwat University!

7
00:00:20,269 --> 00:00:21,501
We did it!

8
00:00:22,093 --> 00:00:24,724
The more you’re stressed, the more weight is on your shoulders.

9
00:00:25,729 --> 00:00:26,588
Thank you.

10
00:00:26,588 --> 00:00:29,566
Then let’s ramp up our international relations, shall we?

[NOVA - Best Speaker Award]

12
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:07,041
[NOVA - Best Speaker Award]
[Has won a scholarship to study in Finland]

13
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,936
Wake up!

14
00:01:45,047 --> 00:01:47,208
Come on, it’s time to wake up.

15
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:52,673
Wake up!

16
00:01:52,893 --> 00:01:55,551
You’re not waking up, are you?

17
00:02:00,187 --> 00:02:01,337
Zo…

18
00:02:04,217 --> 00:02:05,230
Zo, stop.

19
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:10,436
Zo, stop! Stop!

20
00:02:59,171 --> 00:02:59,945
What are you doing?

21
00:03:04,741 --> 00:03:06,159
Are you expecting me to eat two eggs?

22
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,914
That’s right, for nourishment.

23
00:03:12,266 --> 00:03:13,225
What are you smiling about?

24
00:03:14,623 --> 00:03:16,020
What are you thinking?

25
00:03:18,219 --> 00:03:22,988
Mom says eggs are packed with choline, a brain booster.

26
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,195
Your mom's a genius.

27
00:03:25,717 --> 00:03:29,307
She’s not only a Thai language teacher but also a queen of general knowledge.

28
00:03:29,655 --> 00:03:31,984
She's amazing, always swamped with work, though.

29
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:34,377
She won't make it to my debate.

30
00:03:35,203 --> 00:03:38,766
No worries. The debate's going to be streamed, right?

31
00:03:39,273 --> 00:03:40,834
She can catch it later.

32
00:03:43,702 --> 00:03:47,155
Did you tell your folks?

33
00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:04,433
Dropped a message in the fam chat about it.

34
00:04:05,474 --> 00:04:08,351
Got left on read by everyone.

35
00:04:09,933 --> 00:04:14,236
Hey, don’t sweat it. Maybe it just caught them off guard.

36
00:04:14,397 --> 00:04:16,287
They might just be tied up.

37
00:04:19,124 --> 00:04:20,768
They could’ve at least replied.

38
00:04:22,157 --> 00:04:26,268
A simple "can't make it" would've been nice. I feel like…

39
00:04:27,049 --> 00:04:28,583
they don’t care about me.

40
00:04:30,171 --> 00:04:34,120
To be fair, you never give them a heads-up about stuff.

41
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:41,454
Then, boom! A message about the debate out of nowhere.

42
00:04:42,235 --> 00:04:43,906
What did they even have to go on?

43
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,860
What about your grandma?

44
00:04:51,407 --> 00:04:52,557
Called her?

45
00:04:53,233 --> 00:04:54,877
She’s not the social media type, right?

46
00:04:57,206 --> 00:05:00,906
If she came, she'd be like a fish out of water.

47
00:05:01,538 --> 00:05:03,182
There’d be a huge crowd.

48
00:05:04,187 --> 00:05:07,777
And if my parents weren’t there, who’d look after her?

49
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,112
Yeah, good point.

50
00:05:13,222 --> 00:05:16,702
How about Jeng?

51
00:05:17,202 --> 00:05:19,010
He's your wild card, isn’t he?

52
00:05:19,465 --> 00:05:22,370
Your beloved Pok is ill.

53
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,162
Jeng is taking care of him.

54
00:05:30,001 --> 00:05:31,096
It’s alright.

55
00:05:32,675 --> 00:05:35,223
I’m used to this stuff.

56
00:05:36,685 --> 00:05:39,014
Let’s zone in on today.

57
00:05:39,907 --> 00:05:41,907
Any guesses on the debate topic?

58
00:05:43,557 --> 00:05:45,721
But first, let’s eat.

59
00:05:50,423 --> 00:05:51,299
[NOVA: Thailand's National Debate Championship 2023]

60
00:05:51,299 --> 00:05:54,953
And the topic for today’s debate is…

61
00:05:55,542 --> 00:05:59,187
Let’s see where the wheel stops.

62
00:05:59,187 --> 00:06:01,599
And that’ll determine the topic for today.

63
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:08,438
4, 3, 2, 1, 6, 5… and it’s back to 4, and now 3,

64
00:06:09,167 --> 00:06:10,553
or is it…

65
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,162
the wheel lands on number 2!

66
00:06:14,162 --> 00:06:16,624
And today’s topic is:

67
00:06:16,624 --> 00:06:19,370
“Success is the fruit of hard work.”

68
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:24,201
Not too easy, not too hard, definitely challenging.

69
00:06:24,201 --> 00:06:26,866
This one's going to keep our debaters on their toes.

70
00:06:26,866 --> 00:06:32,014
We’ll give each side 10 minutes to prepare.

71
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:36,689
Only 10? We got 15 last time.

72
00:06:36,921 --> 00:06:40,237
They adjust the prep time based on the topic's complexity.

73
00:06:40,645 --> 00:06:46,565
While our teams prep, let's dive into a special clip featuring Mr. Yotin Patarayocha,

74
00:06:46,565 --> 00:06:50,117
a stellar debater who won the 'Best Speaker' title

75
00:06:50,117 --> 00:06:55,450
and earned a scholarship to study in Finland. Stay tuned!.

76
00:06:56,755 --> 00:06:58,207
We are team Affirmative.

77
00:06:58,576 --> 00:07:01,179
What’s our strategy?

78
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:06,494
I think the best defense is a good offense.

79
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:10,989
Let’s hit them first. Zo?

80
00:07:14,613 --> 00:07:15,387
Zo.

81
00:07:16,977 --> 00:07:17,737
Zo!

82
00:07:22,657 --> 00:07:23,456
What do you think?

83
00:07:28,062 --> 00:07:30,524
I bet they will quote,

84
00:07:30,565 --> 00:07:33,744
“Where there’s a will, there’s a way.”

85
00:07:34,217 --> 00:07:37,067
That saying can be construed in many ways.

86
00:07:37,321 --> 00:07:41,871
And this team is good at turning our words against us.

87
00:07:42,581 --> 00:07:44,581
How about we play the "name-drop" game?

88
00:07:47,437 --> 00:07:49,108
To create credibility, right?

89
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:55,120
Okay, why don’t you start first, Joke?

90
00:07:55,664 --> 00:07:58,322
I don’t want to. Too nervous.

91
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:01,448
Come on, we've practiced this a million times.

92
00:08:01,448 --> 00:08:02,621
No time for cold feet.

93
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:07,958
No fear.

94
00:08:09,146 --> 00:08:10,471
Come on, let’s meditate.

95
00:08:12,456 --> 00:08:15,648
Breathe in slowly, then breathe out.

96
00:08:17,118 --> 00:08:18,978
Let’s give it our best shot today.

97
00:08:19,334 --> 00:08:20,373
Come on.

98
00:08:23,631 --> 00:08:27,605
1, 2, 3, yeah!

99
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,803
We now commence the debate on the topic:

100
00:08:40,803 --> 00:08:46,056
“Success is the fruit of hard work.” The floor is open.

101
00:08:48,001 --> 00:08:50,720
“Where there’s a will, there’s a way.”

102
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,210
We've all grown up with the adage.

103
00:08:54,387 --> 00:08:59,128
Yet, isn't there an ironic twist to it?

104
00:08:59,128 --> 00:09:02,282
Will alone doesn't always win you a prize.

105
00:09:02,282 --> 00:09:08,264
Multiple factors affect outcomes, even for the person who tries the hardest.

106
00:09:08,264 --> 00:09:13,119
I contend that hard work, while commendable,

107
00:09:13,338 --> 00:09:16,215
isn't the sole key to success.

108
00:09:19,069 --> 00:09:20,877
However, can we truly undermine its significance?

109
00:09:21,118 --> 00:09:33,125
Although it might not be the only key, hard work is undeniably intrinsic to achieving our aspirations.

110
00:09:33,528 --> 00:09:37,160
To quote Ralph Waldo Emerson,

111
00:09:37,387 --> 00:09:42,238
"All life is an experiment. The more experiments you make, the better."

112
00:09:42,441 --> 00:09:44,331
Life is all about experimenting.

113
00:09:44,581 --> 00:09:46,480
The more you try, the better you become.

114
00:09:46,844 --> 00:09:50,708
And each experiment in our lives takes hard work.

115
00:09:55,418 --> 00:09:57,800
Supporting the affirmative stance,

116
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:02,693
I'd argue that adopting the right approach is instrumental to success.

117
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:09,967
And success doesn’t have to always be monumental achievements.

118
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:18,560
Allow me to disagree.

119
00:10:18,798 --> 00:10:22,114
How do we know that hard work is the “right approach”?

120
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:26,143
How do we ascertain that hard work, as you describe, guarantees success?

121
00:10:26,143 --> 00:10:33,018
Given the diversity in aptitude, opportunity, and resources among us,

122
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:36,120
if life is about experimentation, what experiment are we doing?

123
00:10:36,364 --> 00:10:37,569
And do we justkeep on experimenting?

124
00:10:37,953 --> 00:10:43,243
Perhaps this is a quote from someone who comes from a place of privilege.

125
00:10:44,767 --> 00:10:48,560
Permit me to be candid here.

126
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:59,174
The essence of hard work isn’t necessarily about grandeur or relentless struggle, as suggested by the opposition.

127
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:05,200
While I concur that various elements contribute to success,

128
00:11:05,363 --> 00:11:10,720
hard work remains a crucial ingredient.

129
00:11:10,934 --> 00:11:16,443
For example, the Negative is justifying their arguments to defeat my team

130
00:11:16,735 --> 00:11:21,680
in order to win a scholarship to study abroad.

131
00:11:21,976 --> 00:11:26,608
Skills in debate and knowledge acquisition are commendable,

132
00:11:26,821 --> 00:11:33,240
but can you say in all honesty that your effort here is not a product of hard work?

133
00:11:33,523 --> 00:11:40,480
In a world rife with challenges, a small victory is what we can achieve every day.

134
00:11:40,844 --> 00:11:47,559
And that will fortify our self-esteem.

135
00:11:48,588 --> 00:11:50,424
A big round of applause for both sides!

136
00:11:56,103 --> 00:11:58,459
Let's allow the judges some time for deliberation.

137
00:11:58,459 --> 00:12:04,362
We'll reconvene shortly to unveil the winner of this final round.

138
00:12:09,868 --> 00:12:11,868
[Sai: Well done!]

139
00:12:36,227 --> 00:12:37,318
You trying to scare me with that?

140
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:39,789
Never!

141
00:12:40,419 --> 00:12:43,982
Didn't you mention loving that soda can ‘pop’ sound?

142
00:12:58,486 --> 00:12:59,815
You totally were trying to freak me out.

143
00:13:00,486 --> 00:13:01,596
No way!

144
00:13:03,388 --> 00:13:06,485
Here, got another one for you.

145
00:13:28,857 --> 00:13:30,000
Good, right?

146
00:13:31,109 --> 00:13:31,864
Yep.

147
00:13:33,673 --> 00:13:35,137
Shouldn't we head back?

148
00:13:35,616 --> 00:13:36,793
They're announcing the winners soon.

149
00:13:37,944 --> 00:13:38,767
Come on.

150
00:13:39,642 --> 00:13:40,612
Hey.

151
00:13:42,531 --> 00:13:43,287
Hmm?

152
00:13:44,029 --> 00:13:45,453
You think we've got a shot at winning?

153
00:13:48,132 --> 00:13:48,858
Why?

154
00:13:49,968 --> 00:13:51,105
Doubting yourself?

155
00:13:56,015 --> 00:13:57,165
Don’t worry.

156
00:13:57,988 --> 00:14:01,825
Given our performance, it’s a sure win for us.

157
00:14:03,526 --> 00:14:07,390
I have to figure out how to join you in Finland.

158
00:14:08,528 --> 00:14:10,309
Dramatic.

159
00:14:12,955 --> 00:14:13,649
What to do?

160
00:14:14,955 --> 00:14:18,235
What ticket do I buy? First class or business?

161
00:14:18,235 --> 00:14:20,083
Been looking all over for you. Here you are.

162
00:14:20,627 --> 00:14:22,627
Let’s head back. Announcement time.

163
00:14:24,023 --> 00:14:26,023
Let’s go.

164
00:14:26,352 --> 00:14:27,121
Come on.

165
00:14:33,347 --> 00:14:41,480
The moment has arrived. We now conclude NOVA, the National Debate Championship of 2023.

166
00:14:41,601 --> 00:14:44,451
And the winner is...

167
00:14:50,704 --> 00:14:52,567
A big congratulations to…

168
00:15:03,994 --> 00:15:06,000
Bandit Apiwat University!

169
00:15:12,123 --> 00:15:16,280
Kindly join us on stage for the award presentation and a photo-op.

170
00:15:20,223 --> 00:15:22,771
What a memorable moment!

171
00:15:23,734 --> 00:15:24,802
Look at the camera.

172
00:15:26,121 --> 00:15:29,640
Your mom may be watching. She’ll be so proud of you.

173
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:35,349
Next is another grand prize that I believe everyone is awaiting.

174
00:15:35,349 --> 00:15:37,898
If you'll kindly step to the side, champions.

175
00:15:39,673 --> 00:15:46,745
As I said, this is the big award we've all been eagerly anticipating

176
00:15:47,358 --> 00:15:50,838
The Best Speaker Award for this year.

177
00:15:55,392 --> 00:15:59,613
The Best Speaker Award goes to…

178
00:16:07,331 --> 00:16:12,210
Ms. Nita Pitchayadecha. Congratulations!

179
00:16:13,443 --> 00:16:18,404
Big congratulations. Please step front to accept the award.

180
00:16:31,481 --> 00:16:32,429
Zo,

181
00:16:33,481 --> 00:16:34,331
Zo,

182
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:35,574
Zo!

183
00:16:36,213 --> 00:16:36,981
Huh?

184
00:16:38,078 --> 00:16:39,228
Are you alright?

185
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,124
I’m good.

186
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:52,808
We extend our heartfelt congratulations to all our winners today.

187
00:16:52,808 --> 00:16:57,471
Thus, we close the curtains on NOVA 2023.

188
00:16:57,471 --> 00:17:00,652
We eagerly await next year. Until then, take care and goodbye.

189
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,594
Why did you get up?

190
00:17:12,003 --> 00:17:13,052
Lie down.

191
00:17:14,212 --> 00:17:16,917
Can’t do. I can't miss Zo's debate.

192
00:17:16,917 --> 00:17:19,978
Stop right there. You’re not feeling well.

193
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:22,132
I'm fine, seriously.

194
00:17:24,031 --> 00:17:27,054
Yeah right. You're burning up.

195
00:17:28,104 --> 00:17:30,649
Already told Joke we couldn’t make it.

196
00:17:35,062 --> 00:17:36,903
Just my luck to get sick today.

197
00:17:39,318 --> 00:17:40,507
It’s alright.

198
00:17:41,189 --> 00:17:43,818
We can congratulate them later.

199
00:17:47,713 --> 00:17:48,992
Congratulate?

200
00:17:50,446 --> 00:17:51,531
That means…

201
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:52,440
Yep.

202
00:17:56,404 --> 00:17:57,313
Really?

203
00:17:58,638 --> 00:18:00,933
Zo must be on cloud nine!

204
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,160
First, let's get you better, okay?

205
00:18:05,296 --> 00:18:05,956
Oh no!

206
00:18:08,284 --> 00:18:11,989
What if you catch my fever?

207
00:18:14,955 --> 00:18:16,228
It's okay.

208
00:18:19,566 --> 00:18:21,748
I was hugging you all night anyway.

209
00:18:24,425 --> 00:18:25,607
Thank you.

210
00:18:27,087 --> 00:18:29,087
Thanks for everything you’ve done for me.

211
00:18:30,827 --> 00:18:32,304
Stop talking.

212
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:33,714
Here.

213
00:18:42,897 --> 00:18:43,796
Yummy?

214
00:18:45,396 --> 00:18:46,305
Good.

215
00:18:51,304 --> 00:18:52,183
Big congrats!

216
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:54,031
Thanks so much.

217
00:18:54,161 --> 00:18:55,956
Totally worth the grind!

218
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:56,957
Thanks.

219
00:18:56,957 --> 00:18:57,760
Thank you.

220
00:18:57,993 --> 00:18:58,844
Not you.

221
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:01,039
Kidding! You guys nailed it.

222
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,468
Let's snap a pic.

223
00:19:02,582 --> 00:19:03,626
Sure.

224
00:19:07,728 --> 00:19:09,614
Flash those pearly whites!

225
00:19:10,334 --> 00:19:12,334
Smile from ear to ear!

226
00:19:12,935 --> 00:19:15,026
And... got it.

227
00:19:16,793 --> 00:19:22,200
You guys should celebrate at my spot. It's on me. Go all out.

228
00:19:22,341 --> 00:19:25,240
Sounds great! Let me change real quick.

229
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:29,383
Yeah, can't rock up to a hotpot joint in this uniform.

230
00:19:29,849 --> 00:19:30,778
See you at 7.

231
00:19:30,937 --> 00:19:33,440
Zo, tell Pat and Kot to come.

232
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,394
The more, the merrier.

233
00:19:34,576 --> 00:19:36,520
Will do. Where’s your hotpot joint?

234
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,563
You’ve never been?

235
00:19:40,034 --> 00:19:42,034
Sorry to interrupt.

236
00:19:42,034 --> 00:19:44,862
Mind if I grab a selfie with you, Nita?

237
00:19:45,213 --> 00:19:48,281
I loved your speech. So moving.

238
00:19:48,281 --> 00:19:49,473
Pleasure.

239
00:19:49,473 --> 00:19:50,324
You’re sweet.

240
00:19:50,845 --> 00:19:51,663
Thanks.

241
00:19:55,281 --> 00:19:58,554
Look at our shining star! So gifted.

242
00:20:01,206 --> 00:20:03,365
Zo, you've never been there?

243
00:20:04,347 --> 00:20:08,211
Joke, lead the way. You know where it is.

244
00:20:10,441 --> 00:20:11,120
Yep.

245
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,668
By the way, Joke and Zo.

246
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:17,330
I…

247
00:20:20,718 --> 00:20:22,440
I need a favor.

248
00:20:32,195 --> 00:20:33,148
Is it too small?

249
00:20:34,195 --> 00:20:36,538
No, it fits. Park said he got the right size.

250
00:20:37,995 --> 00:20:39,290
You can still back out.

251
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:41,121
I can take you home now.

252
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:46,224
If we leave now, the plan will be ruined.

253
00:20:47,867 --> 00:20:49,662
Why? Got problems with my costume?

254
00:20:50,447 --> 00:20:51,202
Nah.

255
00:20:52,088 --> 00:20:53,697
Just don't want you pushing yourself for others.

256
00:20:54,692 --> 00:20:56,942
Think of you first.

257
00:20:59,075 --> 00:21:00,666
I'm not doing things I don’t want to.

258
00:21:01,655 --> 00:21:05,723
There’s no harm in doing this.

259
00:21:06,518 --> 00:21:09,791
The costume isn’t too funny.

260
00:21:11,171 --> 00:21:12,440
It's not the costume that bothers me.

261
00:21:14,024 --> 00:21:17,660
You might be acting cool, but I can tell you’re kind of cringing inside.

262
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,161
I’ve told you.

263
00:21:23,109 --> 00:21:25,268
You don’t always have to put on a brave face, you know?

264
00:21:30,144 --> 00:21:31,348
Here I am.

265
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:36,566
Zo, this looks cute on you.

266
00:21:38,535 --> 00:21:41,320
Here’s the cake. Stick the candles in it.

267
00:21:42,441 --> 00:21:44,850
Here you go. Candles right here.

268
00:21:45,313 --> 00:21:47,600
After you’re done, hide in that room.

269
00:21:48,095 --> 00:21:48,786
Got it.

270
00:21:48,786 --> 00:21:49,368
Great.

271
00:21:49,368 --> 00:21:52,189
Hey, Nita is here. Come with me to greet her.

272
00:21:52,441 --> 00:21:53,285
But I think…

273
00:21:53,285 --> 00:21:54,077
Hey!

274
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,072
We can talk later. Go ahead.

275
00:21:59,212 --> 00:22:00,303
Come now, talk later.

276
00:22:01,338 --> 00:22:02,307
Don’t forget the candles!

277
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,266
Okay.

278
00:22:03,266 --> 00:22:04,033
Use them all.

279
00:22:04,147 --> 00:22:04,837
Sure.

280
00:22:05,451 --> 00:22:06,996
She’s here.

281
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:24,782
Zo, wear this.

282
00:22:28,572 --> 00:22:31,845
Park, really? Zo in the frog costume?

283
00:22:32,746 --> 00:22:37,042
Yeah, Nita likes this character, Kero Keroppi.

284
00:22:38,091 --> 00:22:40,040
Why not wear it yourself? That’d be a bigger surprise.

285
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:45,353
I own the place. It’d be weird if I wasn’t there.

286
00:22:45,617 --> 00:22:47,981
It’d be weirder if Zo wasn’t here with me.

287
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:50,130
Make an excuse.

288
00:22:51,096 --> 00:22:52,596
Please, Zo. Help me.

289
00:22:55,378 --> 00:22:58,719
This is the last time in our campus life to surprise–

290
00:22:58,719 --> 00:23:02,441
Hold on! Don’t push him.

291
00:23:09,958 --> 00:23:10,691
Fine, I’ll do it.

292
00:23:12,282 --> 00:23:14,458
Sure, Park. I’ll wear it.

293
00:23:14,458 --> 00:23:15,550
Here you go.

294
00:23:17,098 --> 00:23:17,908
Zo,

295
00:23:18,954 --> 00:23:20,917
don’t wear this if you don’t want to.

296
00:23:21,765 --> 00:23:23,400
Don’t feel obligated to play nice with Park.

297
00:23:27,156 --> 00:23:27,933
It’s fine.

298
00:23:29,729 --> 00:23:30,784
This is cute.

299
00:23:31,557 --> 00:23:32,747
Just a bit of fun, right?

300
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:36,360
You’re the best, man. Problem solved!

301
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,328
Let me give you a bonus.

302
00:23:40,869 --> 00:23:42,440
What? I can’t?

303
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,200
What was that?

304
00:23:43,435 --> 00:23:45,617
Just a little bonus for doing me a favor.

305
00:23:50,521 --> 00:23:52,998
Guys, don’t be shy.

306
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:55,059
Tell me if you want more.

307
00:23:55,358 --> 00:23:57,131
You weren't kidding with the whole "all out" thing, huh?

308
00:23:57,131 --> 00:23:58,537
How could we finish this mountain of food?

309
00:23:58,537 --> 00:23:59,547
Right, Joke?

310
00:24:00,706 --> 00:24:01,506
Joke?

311
00:24:05,756 --> 00:24:06,462
Yeah.

312
00:24:08,667 --> 00:24:09,872
Shall we wait for others?

313
00:24:10,369 --> 00:24:12,801
- Hey, we’re here!
- Hey!

314
00:24:12,801 --> 00:24:14,185
Ouch, watch it!

315
00:24:14,781 --> 00:24:16,122
You sure took your sweet time.

316
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:22,209
Speaking of time, where's Zo at?

317
00:24:23,017 --> 00:24:26,403
He’s taking a shower. He’ll be here soon.

318
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:29,497
He lives close by.

319
00:24:29,497 --> 00:24:30,535
Near, huh?

320
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:34,939
And he was the one rushing us. Yet, he's fashionably late.

321
00:24:43,517 --> 00:24:47,767
Nita, you've made history for our debate club.

322
00:24:47,767 --> 00:24:50,435
Major win because of you.

323
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:53,831
I can’t take all the credit. It’s a team win.

324
00:24:54,692 --> 00:24:58,579
Tone down the modesty, or people might roll their eyes.

325
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,040
Fine. In that case, thanks!

326
00:25:04,041 --> 00:25:06,268
Dig in! There's enough to feed an army.

327
00:25:08,975 --> 00:25:10,975
[Mom: Well done, son. Congratulations.]

328
00:25:11,726 --> 00:25:13,726
[Zo: Sorry to disappoint you.]

329
00:25:18,641 --> 00:25:21,200
- Wasn’t going to hold back.
- You think we can finish all this?

330
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:27,950
[Showtime.]

331
00:25:37,192 --> 00:25:39,578
Woah! What just happened?

332
00:25:39,578 --> 00:25:40,625
Lights out, Park!

333
00:25:40,952 --> 00:25:41,851
Forgot to pay the electric bill?

334
00:25:42,033 --> 00:25:43,134
Could it be…

335
00:25:43,134 --> 00:25:44,145
What?

336
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:45,966
Whoa!

337
00:25:45,966 --> 00:25:54,677
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

338
00:25:55,251 --> 00:26:03,615
♪ Happy birthday, happy birthday ♪

339
00:26:04,804 --> 00:26:11,986
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

340
00:26:13,961 --> 00:26:17,440
Happy birthday, Nita. Wish you happiness. Ribbit!

341
00:26:17,831 --> 00:26:19,445
Man, he added the ribbit touch!

342
00:26:19,861 --> 00:26:20,873
Thanks so much.

343
00:26:21,411 --> 00:26:22,800
This is so sweet.

344
00:26:23,941 --> 00:26:26,120
Park, is this your plan?

345
00:26:26,892 --> 00:26:28,892
No, no, no. What plan?

346
00:26:28,892 --> 00:26:31,142
The candles are melting. Blow them.

347
00:26:31,142 --> 00:26:32,150
Make a wish.

348
00:26:35,672 --> 00:26:37,672
Yay!

349
00:26:39,801 --> 00:26:41,710
Thanks so much, guys.

350
00:26:42,241 --> 00:26:45,199
Let’s snap a pic. Look at this cutie.

351
00:26:49,173 --> 00:26:51,173
3, 2, 1!

352
00:26:51,455 --> 00:26:53,250
Let’s get in on this. Come on, Kot.

353
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:54,259
I’m in.

354
00:26:54,259 --> 00:26:56,454
Come on.

355
00:26:56,701 --> 00:26:58,474
Congratulations, Nita.

356
00:26:58,474 --> 00:26:59,202
Thanks.

357
00:27:00,042 --> 00:27:02,042
Ribbit!

358
00:27:03,264 --> 00:27:06,673
Happy birthday!

359
00:27:49,382 --> 00:27:51,882
Saijai, Joke isn’t here.

360
00:27:52,327 --> 00:27:53,713
Shall I call him?

361
00:27:54,636 --> 00:27:57,341
That’s fine. He’ll turn up.

362
00:27:58,009 --> 00:27:59,077
Come on.

363
00:28:00,772 --> 00:28:01,840
Then we’ll sit and wait.

364
00:28:46,721 --> 00:28:47,388
Zo.

365
00:28:51,806 --> 00:28:53,608
You’re upset about the grand prize, huh?

366
00:28:55,281 --> 00:28:56,344
How’d you know?

367
00:28:57,281 --> 00:28:58,397
I'm your boyfriend,

368
00:29:00,766 --> 00:29:02,532
and you're important to me.

369
00:29:03,495 --> 00:29:04,537
It's my job to notice.

370
00:29:13,998 --> 00:29:17,627
I’m sorry I never told you about this.

371
00:29:19,822 --> 00:29:22,686
I'm curious why you didn't tell me.

372
00:29:24,058 --> 00:29:26,137
Don't be mad at me now.

373
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,511
Please.

374
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:40,749
How can I be mad at this face?

375
00:29:45,281 --> 00:29:46,960
I just want to help.

376
00:29:48,591 --> 00:29:50,492
If I can make you feel a bit better,

377
00:29:52,292 --> 00:29:53,675
that's good enough for me.

378
00:30:03,055 --> 00:30:07,696
I didn't dare tell anyone about this.

379
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,766
It's such a big prize to win.

380
00:30:11,963 --> 00:30:14,802
And I wasn't confident in myself.

381
00:30:17,894 --> 00:30:21,844
Was kinda embarrassed to even want it so bad.

382
00:30:23,128 --> 00:30:27,201
It's too ambitious anyway.

383
00:30:32,446 --> 00:30:34,347
Why did you want it that bad?

384
00:30:35,421 --> 00:30:36,434
Want to go to Finland?

385
00:30:43,345 --> 00:30:48,281
Promise you won't laugh when I tell you.

386
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:51,964
Never.

387
00:30:54,161 --> 00:30:55,026
You can tell me.

388
00:31:00,796 --> 00:31:02,313
Alright,

389
00:31:04,164 --> 00:31:06,145
if you're not ready to tell me,

390
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:09,501
wait until you are, okay?

391
00:31:10,513 --> 00:31:11,877
Do what makes you feel good.

392
00:31:18,949 --> 00:31:21,615
I just wanted to make my mom proud.

393
00:31:26,235 --> 00:31:29,395
Remember Yotin from the clip?

394
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,910
Hello, I’m Yotin Patarayocha.

395
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:39,652
I won the Debate Competition in 2019 and the Best Speaker Award.

396
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:43,198
Yotin was my mom’s dearest student.

397
00:31:44,132 --> 00:31:46,132
She loved him like a son.

398
00:31:47,383 --> 00:31:51,160
That evening, after I got back from a tutoring class…

399
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:54,542
It suits you perfectly because you’re so talented.

400
00:31:54,542 --> 00:31:55,763
Thank you.

401
00:31:55,763 --> 00:31:58,380
You apply everything I teach you.

402
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:00,405
I remember everything you’ve taught me.

403
00:32:03,462 --> 00:32:04,292
Zo,

404
00:32:05,773 --> 00:32:09,280
this is Yotin, my student.

405
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:13,553
Yotin competed in a debate and won.

406
00:32:13,553 --> 00:32:17,917
He even won the grand prize. He’s going to study in Finland.

407
00:32:17,917 --> 00:32:21,847
I’m so proud and happy for him. He’s exceptional!

408
00:32:21,847 --> 00:32:22,877
You’re too kind.

409
00:32:24,478 --> 00:32:28,675
Zo, you can ask him for advice.

410
00:32:28,675 --> 00:32:32,251
He’s like another son of mine. Just ask.

411
00:32:32,801 --> 00:32:38,160
Can you take a picture? I want a picture of me and him with the award.

412
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:41,226
1, 2, 3.

413
00:32:42,144 --> 00:32:43,309
One more.

414
00:32:43,951 --> 00:32:44,786
Great.

415
00:32:50,239 --> 00:32:53,794
1, 2, 3.

416
00:32:54,793 --> 00:32:56,071
I’m tagging you.

417
00:32:56,293 --> 00:32:58,644
Done. Accept it.

418
00:32:59,836 --> 00:33:00,830
You did?

419
00:33:01,003 --> 00:33:02,823
Yes, I liked the photo.

420
00:33:22,247 --> 00:33:28,171
My mom's never said she’s proud of me. Not once.

421
00:33:31,576 --> 00:33:37,426
I was close today, so close.

422
00:33:46,709 --> 00:33:49,154
It’s going to be alright.

423
00:33:50,484 --> 00:33:51,941
So close.

424
00:33:54,858 --> 00:33:56,562
Everything I’ve done…

425
00:34:00,409 --> 00:34:02,026
I tried my best.

426
00:34:04,716 --> 00:34:06,135
I did.

427
00:34:06,654 --> 00:34:07,417
Zo.

428
00:34:08,009 --> 00:34:08,876
But…

429
00:34:13,707 --> 00:34:14,273
Zo,

430
00:34:16,099 --> 00:34:17,039
listen to me.

431
00:34:21,482 --> 00:34:26,049
Right here, you have someone who’s bursting with pride for you.

432
00:34:30,783 --> 00:34:32,385
I know it’s not the same.

433
00:34:36,004 --> 00:34:39,796
But your efforts? They count.

434
00:34:41,689 --> 00:34:43,121
They’re not worthless.

435
00:34:44,298 --> 00:34:45,147
Got it?

436
00:34:54,822 --> 00:34:55,973
Thank you.

437
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:01,316
Man, you're going to make me tear up.

438
00:35:19,822 --> 00:35:20,771
Wait, got a call.

439
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:27,622
Yes, Dad?

440
00:35:31,024 --> 00:35:31,720
What?

441
00:35:34,435 --> 00:35:37,000
Yes, I’ll be there soon.

442
00:35:38,374 --> 00:35:39,466
Just hang on tight.

443
00:35:40,897 --> 00:35:42,570
What's going on?

444
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:45,280
Take me to the hospital now!

445
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:49,326
Which hospital? Zo, what’s going on? Zo!

446
00:36:01,256 --> 00:36:02,003
Dad!

447
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,989
Zo? What brought you here?

448
00:36:22,352 --> 00:36:26,800
Did you call him, honey?

449
00:36:26,841 --> 00:36:29,458
Look at him, all soaked from the rain.

450
00:36:30,283 --> 00:36:32,480
I didn't know it was raining.

451
00:36:32,638 --> 00:36:35,477
I told you to call tomorrow.

452
00:36:35,477 --> 00:36:37,897
Give him some time to party with his pals.

453
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,058
What if something happened to me–

454
00:36:39,058 --> 00:36:39,723
You’re fine.

455
00:36:40,131 --> 00:36:42,760
The doctor said you’re alright. Don’t make a big deal out of nothing.

456
00:36:44,008 --> 00:36:45,613
What happened, Mom?

457
00:36:46,331 --> 00:36:47,800
Was it a kidney stone?

458
00:36:48,146 --> 00:36:52,417
Yes, indeed. But surgery these days is minimally invasive.

459
00:36:52,417 --> 00:36:55,010
They just insert a tool. It doesn’t hurt much.

460
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:57,075
An ingrown nail hurts even more.

461
00:36:58,511 --> 00:37:00,980
Are you feeling okay, Dad? Any pain?

462
00:37:01,289 --> 00:37:04,301
He’s fine. The doctor gave him the all-clear.

463
00:37:04,301 --> 00:37:05,948
He worries excessively about nothing.

464
00:37:06,285 --> 00:37:11,666
I’m fine. As your mom said, I’m overworried.

465
00:37:14,439 --> 00:37:17,500
I'm sorry for the fuss.

466
00:37:18,938 --> 00:37:21,588
No trouble at all.

467
00:37:22,802 --> 00:37:27,146
Congrats on your big win! Well done!

468
00:37:28,662 --> 00:37:30,637
Is that Pat?

469
00:37:31,219 --> 00:37:35,786
No, this is Joke, Zo’s friend.

470
00:37:37,524 --> 00:37:40,280
Zo and Joke, don’t worry.

471
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,547
He’s just out of surgery, so he’s a bit loopy.

472
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:48,264
Excuse me, visiting hours are up.

473
00:37:49,919 --> 00:37:53,499
I have to go, but I’ll be here first thing in the morning.

474
00:37:53,961 --> 00:37:58,680
Buzz the doc if it hurts, okay? Don’t think you’ll disturb him.

475
00:37:59,046 --> 00:38:00,202
Don’t just hold it in.

476
00:38:01,535 --> 00:38:02,920
Lay down.

477
00:38:06,397 --> 00:38:09,240
Better head out before the nurse chases you.

478
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,931
Press the button if you feel pain. Where’s the button?

479
00:38:10,931 --> 00:38:11,770
Out already!

480
00:38:12,353 --> 00:38:13,447
Okay, let’s go, boys.

481
00:38:14,632 --> 00:38:15,859
Goodbye.

482
00:38:15,859 --> 00:38:16,767
See you later.

483
00:38:16,767 --> 00:38:18,087
Bye.

484
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:29,651
Zo, you know your dad was in pain for a long time.

485
00:38:30,281 --> 00:38:33,712
But he wouldn’t tell me, wouldn’t see the doctor.

486
00:38:33,851 --> 00:38:37,011
And he ended up being hospitalized on your big day.

487
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,600
He didn’t want us to worry.

488
00:38:41,774 --> 00:38:44,909
How'd you even get here?

489
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:47,000
Thought you were busy with work?

490
00:38:47,318 --> 00:38:51,786
I was, but the school canceled the meeting.

491
00:38:51,987 --> 00:38:54,440
So we thought we’d come and surprise you.

492
00:38:54,809 --> 00:38:56,160
Look how it turned out.

493
00:38:56,451 --> 00:38:59,981
He felt severe stomach pain and ended up at the hospital.

494
00:39:00,986 --> 00:39:02,715
Why didn't you tell me?

495
00:39:03,072 --> 00:39:05,763
Right in the middle of your competition? Certainly not!

496
00:39:05,763 --> 00:39:08,243
If I’d told you, it would've thrown you off.

497
00:39:09,067 --> 00:39:12,967
You could've told me after. Why didn't you?

498
00:39:12,967 --> 00:39:15,334
I just wanted you to celebrate with your friends.

499
00:39:15,632 --> 00:39:17,632
I would’ve given you a call tomorrow anyway.

500
00:39:19,919 --> 00:39:21,722
Let’s head off.

501
00:39:23,856 --> 00:39:25,461
Need to use the bathroom real quick.

502
00:39:26,793 --> 00:39:30,280
Use the one in your father’s room.

503
00:39:41,293 --> 00:39:42,077
Joke,

504
00:39:43,293 --> 00:39:47,240
thank you for always being there for Zo.

505
00:39:47,594 --> 00:39:50,280
It’s my pleasure.

506
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:53,302
Tired?

507
00:39:55,153 --> 00:39:57,960
Zo’s like his dad.

508
00:39:58,498 --> 00:40:01,362
He keeps things to himself.

509
00:40:07,943 --> 00:40:09,943
Is there anything I don’t know about?

510
00:40:16,053 --> 00:40:17,114
Nothing.

511
00:40:18,397 --> 00:40:21,631
He was exhausted earlier.

512
00:40:23,238 --> 00:40:26,867
He might want some encouragement from you.

513
00:40:28,214 --> 00:40:29,523
Encouragement from me?

514
00:40:30,981 --> 00:40:31,769
Yes.

515
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,732
Zo.

516
00:40:51,572 --> 00:40:52,659
Give me a hug.

517
00:40:55,105 --> 00:40:57,697
You did such a great job today.

518
00:40:59,042 --> 00:41:00,739
You nailed your speech.

519
00:41:02,615 --> 00:41:04,680
I’m so proud of you.

520
00:41:05,977 --> 00:41:06,866
Thank you.

521
00:41:13,577 --> 00:41:16,860
Go ahead. Don’t worry about me.

522
00:41:17,058 --> 00:41:19,231
I got myself a hotel room nearby.

523
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:20,965
I’ll find my way there.

524
00:41:21,224 --> 00:41:23,446
I’ll drop by tomorrow.

525
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:26,056
Another hug for your old mom?

526
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:32,772
See you tomorrow.

527
00:41:32,772 --> 00:41:33,667
Yes.

528
00:41:33,667 --> 00:41:34,343
Alright.

529
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:36,750
Let’s go home.

530
00:41:38,848 --> 00:41:39,787
See you later.

531
00:41:40,009 --> 00:41:42,279
Goodbye.

532
00:41:42,279 --> 00:41:43,253
Bye.

533
00:41:43,253 --> 00:41:44,220
Get there safe.

534
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:45,328
Thanks, bye!

535
00:41:54,225 --> 00:41:55,682
What did you say to my mom?

536
00:41:57,401 --> 00:41:58,242
Nothing.

537
00:42:00,932 --> 00:42:01,770
Shall we go?

538
00:42:02,954 --> 00:42:04,164
Yep.

539
00:42:17,208 --> 00:42:19,922
(And the winner is...

540
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:22,940
Bandit Apiwat University!)

541
00:42:23,329 --> 00:42:24,718
Look!

542
00:42:24,718 --> 00:42:26,398
That’s my grandson!

543
00:42:35,843 --> 00:42:40,073
Honey, quit filming. It's so awkward.

544
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:44,082
I’m beaming with joy.

545
00:42:49,246 --> 00:42:49,976
(Bro!)

546
00:42:53,842 --> 00:42:56,174
(I’m returning your VR headset…)

547
00:42:56,695 --> 00:43:00,925
Joke’s out right now. Come on in.

548
00:43:02,542 --> 00:43:04,542
Wow, it’s a full house! Hello.

549
00:43:04,542 --> 00:43:06,443
Hello.

550
00:43:08,163 --> 00:43:11,039
I’m just returning his VR headset.

551
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:14,082
Thought he’d be here by now. I saw the lights on.

552
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:18,122
Jeng, do you know where he is?

553
00:43:18,546 --> 00:43:21,130
I waited and dozed off, and he’s still out.

554
00:43:23,996 --> 00:43:27,058
We wanted to surprise him.

555
00:43:28,294 --> 00:43:31,091
He may be out celebrating with his friends.

556
00:43:31,323 --> 00:43:33,682
Joke out celebrating? With whom?

557
00:43:33,815 --> 00:43:37,196
Think he’s grabbing some hotpot with Zo.

558
00:43:38,009 --> 00:43:40,620
Oh, Zo.

559
00:43:40,963 --> 00:43:42,087
Yes, Grandma.

560
00:43:42,783 --> 00:43:49,082
Can't get through to him? Me neither. Want me to try Zo?

561
00:43:49,082 --> 00:43:52,332
It’s fine. It’s good that Joke’s with his friends.

562
00:43:52,723 --> 00:43:56,051
Alright then. I should go.

563
00:43:56,401 --> 00:43:58,401
I'll just leave this here.

564
00:43:58,401 --> 00:43:59,596
Thank you.

565
00:43:59,596 --> 00:44:01,433
Goodbye.

566
00:44:04,355 --> 00:44:08,267
Why are we even here? Time to head back.

567
00:44:10,491 --> 00:44:12,491
What about the food? Just leave it there?

568
00:44:12,491 --> 00:44:13,945
Yeah, he can eat later.

569
00:44:23,324 --> 00:44:24,018
Joke.

570
00:44:29,222 --> 00:44:33,343
Do you think my mom meant it when she said all that?

571
00:44:38,438 --> 00:44:39,182
Of course.

572
00:44:40,085 --> 00:44:40,996
Why wouldn't she be?

573
00:44:42,315 --> 00:44:45,696
I don’t actually feel it, you know?

574
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:50,934
Maybe she was sugarcoating it?

575
00:44:52,258 --> 00:44:55,639
Like she’s actually disappointed inside.

576
00:44:58,076 --> 00:45:00,554
Your mom had a long day.

577
00:45:01,558 --> 00:45:03,133
Might've just been tired.

578
00:45:06,139 --> 00:45:07,263
You're reading too much into it.

579
00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:10,033
Don't say that.

580
00:45:11,254 --> 00:45:13,647
You don’t know how she feels.

581
00:45:15,426 --> 00:45:16,471
To be honest,

582
00:45:17,719 --> 00:45:19,988
neither do you.

583
00:45:20,944 --> 00:45:24,082
You’re just guessing.

584
00:45:31,999 --> 00:45:33,162
I'm sorry, Zo.

585
00:45:34,082 --> 00:45:35,450
I don't want to fight.

586
00:45:36,967 --> 00:45:38,648
I hate seeing you feel down.

587
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:42,134
Alright, I get it.

588
00:45:48,751 --> 00:45:49,539
Hello.

589
00:45:52,194 --> 00:45:53,087
What?

590
00:45:54,254 --> 00:45:57,582
Grandma and my folks are at my place?

591
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:03,940
But I’m not going there tonight.

592
00:46:09,465 --> 00:46:11,624
Okay, I’ll give Grandma a call.

593
00:46:15,626 --> 00:46:16,602
What happened?

594
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:22,963
Jeng said my family dropped by my place to surprise me.

595
00:46:24,522 --> 00:46:25,526
Surprise?

596
00:46:27,278 --> 00:46:30,080
For winning?

597
00:46:30,717 --> 00:46:32,531
Yeah, that’s it.

598
00:46:32,723 --> 00:46:35,201
You should go see them.

599
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:38,013
No way! I’m staying with you.

600
00:46:39,553 --> 00:46:40,850
You seem off.

601
00:46:41,767 --> 00:46:42,508
Look,

602
00:46:45,535 --> 00:46:47,033
I need some alone time tonight.

603
00:46:48,766 --> 00:46:52,253
Just to process how I feel.

604
00:46:54,876 --> 00:46:57,162
But if I stay with you, I think you’ll–

605
00:46:57,162 --> 00:46:57,709
Look!

606
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:02,020
They're waiting for you.

607
00:47:02,716 --> 00:47:04,530
I’d feel bad keeping them waiting.

608
00:47:05,844 --> 00:47:09,384
I don’t want them to feel like…

609
00:47:11,402 --> 00:47:12,845
Okay, fine.

610
00:47:14,438 --> 00:47:15,705
But promise me.

611
00:47:16,687 --> 00:47:19,747
If you feel down, just call.

612
00:47:20,516 --> 00:47:23,339
Call me at any time, any time at all.

613
00:47:23,943 --> 00:47:24,729
Alright?

614
00:47:27,146 --> 00:47:27,865
Yeah,

615
00:47:29,298 --> 00:47:30,170
I promise.

616
00:47:34,312 --> 00:47:35,245
Promise?

617
00:47:45,805 --> 00:47:46,603
Go on,

618
00:47:48,701 --> 00:47:50,646
go see them.

619
00:47:53,098 --> 00:47:53,976
Talk soon.

620
00:47:57,481 --> 00:47:58,603
Rest up, alright?

621
00:47:59,082 --> 00:48:00,020
Will do.

622
00:48:10,076 --> 00:48:12,076
[Joke sent a sticker.]

623
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:36,039
[From Dad, Mom, and Grandma, congratulations, Joke.
We’re proud of you, as always. Have a feast. Love you.]

624
00:50:10,541 --> 00:50:14,639
Honey, quit filming. It's so awkward.

625
00:50:15,009 --> 00:50:16,635
Look,

626
00:50:18,414 --> 00:50:22,346
look at him shine. He’s so talented.

627
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:26,697
Never thought he'd pull it off like that!

628
00:50:26,697 --> 00:50:27,804
Right?!

629
00:50:27,987 --> 00:50:29,987
That's our boy!

630
00:50:31,243 --> 00:50:33,668
You’re still filming? Stop already!

631
00:50:41,339 --> 00:50:42,303
Bro!

632
00:52:10,989 --> 00:52:12,323
[Joke sent a sticker.]

633
00:53:00,403 --> 00:53:03,040
[Mom: Zo, your dad’s got sepsis. He’s in ICU.]

634
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:03,748
What…

635
00:53:05,155 --> 00:53:05,925
Dad?!

636
00:53:18,471 --> 00:53:19,303
Mom!

637
00:53:23,043 --> 00:53:24,082
How’s he doing?

638
00:53:28,543 --> 00:53:29,955
He’s going to be fine.

639
00:53:31,549 --> 00:53:32,487
Zo…

640
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,276
Have faith.

641
00:53:41,789 --> 00:53:43,265
He’s going to make it.

642
00:53:44,513 --> 00:53:45,629
Stay strong.

643
00:53:46,266 --> 00:53:47,730
He's going to pull through, isn’t he?

644
00:53:48,186 --> 00:53:49,602
Absolutely.

645
00:53:49,846 --> 00:53:51,156
He has to.

646
00:54:35,399 --> 00:54:36,204
Zo!

647
00:54:39,268 --> 00:54:39,922
Joke,

648
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:42,807
how’d you get here?

649
00:54:43,866 --> 00:54:47,247
Been blowing up your phone all day. No answer.

650
00:54:48,216 --> 00:54:49,473
So I called your mom.

651
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:52,289
She filled me in on everything.

652
00:54:57,467 --> 00:54:59,467
Weren't you supposed to–

653
00:55:03,442 --> 00:55:04,725
I know what you're going to say.

654
00:55:06,483 --> 00:55:08,483
If you think you’re getting rid of me like yesterday,

655
00:55:09,193 --> 00:55:11,512
let me tell you, you’re wrong.

656
00:55:28,944 --> 00:55:34,082
You can count on me to be here for you in times like these.

657
00:55:38,595 --> 00:55:39,359
Remember,

658
00:55:41,988 --> 00:55:43,490
I’m your sunshine.

659
00:56:03,164 --> 00:56:04,367
Been here long?

660
00:56:07,301 --> 00:56:08,451
Just now.

661
00:56:40,394 --> 00:56:43,002
Joke's home! Must be raining outside.

662
00:56:43,002 --> 00:56:44,803
So, a national debate, huh?

663
00:56:44,803 --> 00:56:46,479
Word got around, huh?

664
00:56:46,479 --> 00:56:50,031
It’s great… seeing you get it together, finally.

665
00:56:50,809 --> 00:56:53,234
What’s going on between you and Joke?

666
00:56:53,691 --> 00:56:57,390
Just... don't want to get sidetracked, you know?

667
00:56:57,390 --> 00:57:01,581
Besides our family, who's always had your back?

668
00:57:01,581 --> 00:57:04,747
That's someone you want in your corner.

669
00:57:05,056 --> 00:57:08,569
Thank you. Thanks for everything you’ve done for me.
