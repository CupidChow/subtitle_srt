1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,819
And the winner of this debate is…

2
00:00:02,819 --> 00:00:05,634
Bandit Apiwat University!

3
00:00:08,529 --> 00:00:10,197
You’re upset about the grand prize, huh?

4
00:00:10,487 --> 00:00:12,155
Why did you want it that bad?

5
00:00:12,489 --> 00:00:15,520
Yotin was my mom’s dearest student.

6
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:19,688
My mom's never said she’s proud of me. Not once.

7
00:00:20,568 --> 00:00:22,568
You did such a great job today.

8
00:00:22,568 --> 00:00:24,448
I’m so proud of you.

9
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:26,143
You can count on me to be here for you in times like these.

10
00:00:26,366 --> 00:00:28,897
Remember, I’m your sunshine.

11
00:00:31,045 --> 00:00:34,417
As the boy rabbit neared the age of independence,

12
00:00:34,688 --> 00:00:40,161
he trained diligently, read widely, and honed his skills,

13
00:00:40,397 --> 00:00:45,000
all in hopes of showing that his hard work would pay off.

14
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:50,883
The ultimate test arrived: navigating the daunting Enchanted Forest.

15
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:58,908
Completing this journey unscathed would mark his true independence.

16
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:02,087
And so it began.

17
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:07,136
He entered the Forest, full of hope and determination.

18
00:01:07,662 --> 00:01:12,649
But the deeper he ventured, the more uncertainty clouded his mind.

19
00:01:13,977 --> 00:01:20,158
He questioned if all his hard work had been enough,

20
00:01:22,257 --> 00:01:26,890
as the forest's magic seemed to lead him astray.

21
00:01:28,914 --> 00:01:33,038
The challenge ended as he felt the weight of his perceived failure.

22
00:01:34,145 --> 00:01:37,804
Too ashamed to return home to face his parents,

23
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:44,078
he believed he had not become the rabbit he had dreamt of being,

24
00:01:45,317 --> 00:01:51,454
and so, his tale quietly faded into oblivion.

25
00:02:08,398 --> 00:02:09,112
Zo,

26
00:02:10,992 --> 00:02:11,924
were you here for a recording session?

27
00:02:14,557 --> 00:02:15,182
Yep.

28
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:20,393
Gotta dash now.

29
00:02:21,787 --> 00:02:22,558
Hold on a minute.

30
00:02:27,178 --> 00:02:28,758
Why haven’t you been answering my calls?

31
00:02:33,937 --> 00:02:37,087
With everything going on with my dad, it's been a bit crazy.

32
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,443
I just need one minute out of your day, please?

33
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:54,455
Of course.

34
00:03:00,118 --> 00:03:04,700
Sorry, it's just a lot going on right now.

35
00:03:08,596 --> 00:03:13,870
How about I ring you after I leave the hospital?

36
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,442
How about I tag along to the hospital with you?

37
00:03:16,442 --> 00:03:17,380
You don’t have to.

38
00:03:22,056 --> 00:03:25,096
You visiting him occasionally already means a lot.

39
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:31,160
Gotta run

40
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,907
or I’ll be late.

41
00:05:00,377 --> 00:05:01,142
What's up?

42
00:05:01,474 --> 00:05:03,793
Why do you sound so off?

43
00:05:05,114 --> 00:05:06,221
This is how I normally sound.

44
00:05:06,774 --> 00:05:07,512
What’s up?

45
00:05:08,312 --> 00:05:09,494
Certainly not!

46
00:05:09,627 --> 00:05:11,087
I thought you were going to bite off my head.

47
00:05:12,421 --> 00:05:13,846
Just spit it out, what's going on?

48
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:18,781
I'm at your place. It's your dad's birthday. Aren’t you coming?

49
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,714
Everyone's here.

50
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,714
My dad's birthday?

51
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:26,101
How can you not remember your own dad's birthday?

52
00:05:27,228 --> 00:05:28,217
You coming or not?

53
00:05:32,177 --> 00:05:33,274
Probably not.

54
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,971
Feeling kinda under the weather.

55
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,239
Again?

56
00:05:39,704 --> 00:05:41,770
This "under the weather" thing seems to hit you every year on this day.

57
00:05:44,493 --> 00:05:47,710
Don’t mind me. Just enjoy the party without me.

58
00:05:48,234 --> 00:05:49,062
Hanging up now.

59
00:05:50,566 --> 00:05:51,450
I need some rest.

[Bandit Apiwat University Announcement]
[Enrollment List for 2019]

61
00:06:44,554 --> 00:06:46,554
Mr. Jiaranai Tangkanchanapanit

62
00:06:49,294 --> 00:06:51,449
No way! I made it?

63
00:06:54,029 --> 00:06:54,632
Pa,

64
00:06:55,539 --> 00:06:56,363
Grandma,

65
00:06:57,779 --> 00:06:58,529
Ma!

66
00:07:01,018 --> 00:07:01,819
Pa!

67
00:07:02,815 --> 00:07:04,633
Ma! Where's everyone?

68
00:07:07,668 --> 00:07:08,446
Pa!

69
00:07:09,884 --> 00:07:10,686
Ma!

70
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:12,070
Grandma!

71
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:15,492
Pa!

72
00:07:20,912 --> 00:07:21,705
Joke!

73
00:07:24,647 --> 00:07:27,829
Why are you shouting like the house is on fire?

74
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,000
Where are Pa and Ma?

75
00:07:30,496 --> 00:07:32,680
They're with Bachang, getting his graduation stuff sorted.

76
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,596
His graduation day has been announced.

77
00:07:39,064 --> 00:07:40,489
Why do you need your folks?

78
00:07:43,076 --> 00:07:44,083
I…

79
00:07:50,698 --> 00:07:51,779
I got into college.

80
00:07:51,961 --> 00:07:54,470
Really? Oh, Joke! That's fantastic!

81
00:07:55,624 --> 00:08:00,301
We have to tell your parents. They'll be over the moon.

82
00:08:01,739 --> 00:08:03,717
Maybe later.

83
00:08:05,415 --> 00:08:07,415
Let them have their moment with Bachang.

84
00:08:09,446 --> 00:08:10,738
My college news isn’t a big deal.

85
00:08:12,494 --> 00:08:15,866
It doesn't hold a candle to his honors graduation.

86
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:23,305
But it sure made my day!

87
00:08:31,964 --> 00:08:32,607
Zo!

88
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:38,971
Zo…

89
00:08:44,137 --> 00:08:44,966
Oh, you’re back.

90
00:08:45,718 --> 00:08:48,261
Yep, pretty late now

91
00:08:58,228 --> 00:09:01,047
Told you I wasn't feeling great tonight.

92
00:09:05,542 --> 00:09:09,839
I think what you’re feeling isn’t physical,

93
00:09:12,627 --> 00:09:14,201
but mental.

94
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:27,647
Things may have changed, you know.

95
00:09:37,116 --> 00:09:37,692
Here.

96
00:09:38,842 --> 00:09:40,155
Grandma sent this for you.

97
00:09:41,506 --> 00:09:44,457
Call and thank her.

98
00:09:45,315 --> 00:09:46,042
Yeah,

99
00:09:47,315 --> 00:09:48,588
just set it on the table.

100
00:09:55,577 --> 00:10:00,519
Oh, Pok mentioned Zo's dad's not doing great.

101
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,035
How’s he doing?

102
00:10:03,783 --> 00:10:04,653
I have no idea.

103
00:10:06,293 --> 00:10:08,647
Zo’s been spending his time with his dad at the hospital.

104
00:10:10,218 --> 00:10:11,170
We haven't had a chance to chat.

105
00:10:12,763 --> 00:10:14,563
And I just can't seem to pick up the phone and call.

106
00:10:17,336 --> 00:10:18,740
My advice…

107
00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:23,385
You should drop by.

108
00:10:25,188 --> 00:10:27,697
Even if you guys aren't talking much,

109
00:10:29,183 --> 00:10:33,329
I bet he’d appreciate it.

110
00:10:36,334 --> 00:10:37,036
Think so?

111
00:10:38,164 --> 00:10:38,984
Definitely.

112
00:10:40,134 --> 00:10:41,475
Just mull it over.

113
00:10:48,242 --> 00:10:49,352
I'm going to head out.

114
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,686
And hey, eat what Grandma sent, okay?

115
00:10:52,033 --> 00:10:53,619
She packed it for you.

116
00:10:55,268 --> 00:10:56,012
Later.

117
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,463
You look like a lost pup.

118
00:11:33,228 --> 00:11:34,122
Mom.

119
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:38,717
You're late today. Long day at school?

120
00:11:42,586 --> 00:11:43,239
Yeah.

121
00:11:44,331 --> 00:11:46,571
How's Dad?

122
00:11:48,179 --> 00:11:51,445
He's stable now, out of ICU.

123
00:11:51,445 --> 00:11:53,685
They just want to monitor him a bit longer.

124
00:11:58,797 --> 00:12:02,882
You know, in all our years together,

125
00:12:04,979 --> 00:12:07,649
I've never seen him this weak.

126
00:12:13,726 --> 00:12:20,728
It's heart-wrenching, seeing him like this,

127
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:25,976
the person who’s been taking care of you and me,

128
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:30,950
the backbone of our family.

129
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,493
I just can’t believe it.

130
00:12:34,709 --> 00:12:37,272
I can’t believe he’s lying there in this condition.

131
00:12:45,186 --> 00:12:45,970
Mom…

132
00:12:57,032 --> 00:12:58,982
Let’s grab something to eat.

133
00:13:03,385 --> 00:13:04,194
Sounds good.

134
00:13:28,465 --> 00:13:29,326
Here’s some water.

135
00:13:30,465 --> 00:13:31,430
Thanks, Mom.

136
00:13:33,338 --> 00:13:36,256
How was your day? Tough day at school?

137
00:13:38,147 --> 00:13:40,147
Just got a lot on my mind.

138
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:44,166
I feel like I need some alone time.

139
00:13:49,914 --> 00:13:50,728
Have a sip.

140
00:14:03,033 --> 00:14:06,100
Am I one of those things bothering you?

141
00:14:17,351 --> 00:14:18,145
Look,

142
00:14:19,882 --> 00:14:21,981
it's just us three.

143
00:14:23,421 --> 00:14:26,985
I hate seeing any of us down.

144
00:14:29,866 --> 00:14:31,990
Can I ask you something?

145
00:14:33,304 --> 00:14:35,503
Of course, shoot.

146
00:14:39,385 --> 00:14:45,827
Have you ever been disappointed in me?

147
00:14:54,891 --> 00:14:56,891
What brought this on?

148
00:14:58,835 --> 00:15:03,242
Since that fight in high school,

149
00:15:05,249 --> 00:15:06,827
you've seemed different.

150
00:15:08,421 --> 00:15:13,970
Like you were let down by how you raised me.

151
00:15:15,768 --> 00:15:17,768
You know how much it hurts.

152
00:15:19,479 --> 00:15:21,578
It cuts deep thinking I messed up somewhere with you.

153
00:15:22,443 --> 00:15:28,513
So, I've been trying to make you proud of me again ever since.

154
00:15:30,242 --> 00:15:31,071
Zo.

155
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:33,829
I joined the debate competition,

156
00:15:34,611 --> 00:15:39,043
hoping a win would show you I'm worthy.

157
00:15:40,359 --> 00:15:42,359
Like when your student aced that competition.

158
00:15:43,531 --> 00:15:47,294
I’m so proud and happy for him. He’s exceptional!

159
00:15:47,294 --> 00:15:48,747
You’re too kind.

160
00:15:50,239 --> 00:15:51,732
But I’m not so talented.

161
00:15:53,448 --> 00:15:54,781
I didn’t win.

162
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:59,613
Couldn't snag that scholarship and make you proud.

163
00:16:01,072 --> 00:16:08,855
I feel like all that I’ve done means nothing.

164
00:16:09,453 --> 00:16:10,292
Zo,

165
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:14,332
you've got it all wrong.

166
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,583
I’ve never felt that way.

167
00:16:19,969 --> 00:16:23,582
I’ve never set any expectations for you to follow.

168
00:16:31,116 --> 00:16:32,917
I feel so lost.

169
00:16:36,281 --> 00:16:38,157
I don’t know where to go from here.

170
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:48,830
It’s fine, son.

171
00:16:56,507 --> 00:16:57,787
It’s all good, Zo.

172
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:08,421
I’m sorry for making you feel this way.

173
00:17:11,393 --> 00:17:12,748
Everything’s going to be alright.

174
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:53,506
You—

175
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:54,564
Zo, hey, how's it going?

176
00:17:56,424 --> 00:17:57,237
What are you doing here?

177
00:17:58,106 --> 00:17:59,863
I don’t want to keep my distance any longer.

178
00:18:02,436 --> 00:18:03,210
Leave.

179
00:18:04,873 --> 00:18:05,959
Why?

180
00:18:07,746 --> 00:18:09,326
I want to be here with you.

181
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:14,254
I don’t want to concentrate on the wrong thing anymore.

182
00:18:15,443 --> 00:18:19,925
Lately, I've been getting caught up in all this stuff

183
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,820
And missing what really matters:

184
00:18:23,598 --> 00:18:25,300
my family.

185
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:30,266
Is this about me and how you feel about your mom?

186
00:18:33,894 --> 00:18:35,373
What are you getting at?

187
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,010
You're always aiming to make others proud.

188
00:18:40,547 --> 00:18:43,763
When things don't pan out, you beat yourself up.

189
00:18:51,229 --> 00:18:52,112
Look—

190
00:18:52,112 --> 00:18:52,612
Zo

191
00:18:56,628 --> 00:18:58,008
let me tell you something.

192
00:18:58,795 --> 00:18:59,789
You're always enough.

193
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,706
Winning that scholarship or not,

194
00:19:04,146 --> 00:19:06,146
success or failure,

195
00:19:09,247 --> 00:19:10,378
you’re still you at the end,

196
00:19:13,328 --> 00:19:14,931
and you matter.

197
00:19:16,671 --> 00:19:17,423
Remember,

198
00:19:19,781 --> 00:19:21,079
you’re the sun,

199
00:19:23,682 --> 00:19:25,161
always shining brightly on your own.

200
00:19:36,211 --> 00:19:37,154
I’m sorry.

201
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:43,075
But I need to be with my parents.

202
00:20:41,376 --> 00:20:42,114
Zo.

203
00:20:44,224 --> 00:20:44,990
Mom.

204
00:20:46,485 --> 00:20:48,609
What’s going on between you and Joke?

205
00:20:55,225 --> 00:20:56,323
Nothing.

206
00:20:57,862 --> 00:20:58,888
We’re good.

207
00:21:00,536 --> 00:21:03,380
It didn’t seem that way to me.

208
00:21:09,956 --> 00:21:10,892
Zo,

209
00:21:11,736 --> 00:21:13,396
I’ve told you.

210
00:21:13,744 --> 00:21:18,375
You can always come to me when you’re upset.

211
00:21:20,043 --> 00:21:21,844
We are family, after all.

212
00:21:27,285 --> 00:21:28,615
It’s just that…

213
00:21:30,729 --> 00:21:32,729
I don’t want to lose sight of what's important.

214
00:21:36,707 --> 00:21:39,576
I don’t like who I was before this.

215
00:21:42,246 --> 00:21:49,309
Do what you think is important to you.

216
00:21:54,827 --> 00:22:00,728
You've been hard on yourself lately, and it's been taking a toll.

217
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:04,626
You might end up pushing Joke away, like you did to me,

218
00:22:04,626 --> 00:22:05,956
without even asking him.

219
00:22:09,284 --> 00:22:15,379
Zo, what happened wasn’t for nothing.

220
00:22:16,567 --> 00:22:22,315
Consider what you’ve learned and what you’ve taken away.

221
00:22:34,131 --> 00:22:35,728
Think about this.

222
00:22:38,467 --> 00:22:44,115
Besides our family, who's always had your back?

223
00:22:46,887 --> 00:22:50,426
That's something precious you want to keep in your life.

224
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:04,634
Something precious…

225
00:23:09,225 --> 00:23:10,159
Joke!

226
00:23:15,254 --> 00:23:16,361
I’ll be right back.

227
00:24:13,803 --> 00:24:17,044
Zo! Why are you—

228
00:24:24,725 --> 00:24:25,657
Thank you.

229
00:24:28,164 --> 00:24:30,728
Thanks for everything you’ve done for me.

230
00:25:36,456 --> 00:25:41,686
Joke's home! Must be raining outside.

231
00:25:42,188 --> 00:25:44,293
Better grab the laundry.

232
00:25:45,155 --> 00:25:48,571
Joke! You’re here.

233
00:25:50,104 --> 00:25:54,531
Grandma, I was feeling under the weather so I didn’t come home last night.

234
00:25:54,572 --> 00:25:56,257
How about some food?

235
00:25:56,572 --> 00:25:58,099
We've got plenty.

236
00:25:59,002 --> 00:26:01,002
Stay and join us for a family meal.

237
00:26:01,132 --> 00:26:02,712
It's not often we get to eat together.

238
00:26:04,468 --> 00:26:09,252
Come on, stay for a meal since you’re already here.

239
00:26:11,225 --> 00:26:12,363
I can’t.

240
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:14,932
I just remembered I’ve got plans with my friends.

241
00:26:26,968 --> 00:26:31,830
Please, just one meal. You’re hardly ever home.

242
00:26:47,216 --> 00:26:49,374
Jeng mentioned a party last night.

243
00:26:50,221 --> 00:26:51,958
Why so much food left?

244
00:26:52,336 --> 00:26:57,811
We ate last night. But the guests brought a lot of food, so there’s lots left.

245
00:26:58,772 --> 00:27:01,087
Did you eat what I packed for you?

246
00:27:02,689 --> 00:27:03,509
Not yet.

247
00:27:03,929 --> 00:27:04,820
Still in the fridge.

248
00:27:05,986 --> 00:27:08,771
It won't stay fresh forever. Eat it soon.

249
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:12,684
Will do as soon as I’m back.

250
00:27:14,768 --> 00:27:16,322
And what have you been up to?

251
00:27:17,145 --> 00:27:18,624
Heard something about a competition?

252
00:27:19,858 --> 00:27:20,757
Are you proud?

253
00:27:23,357 --> 00:27:26,691
Yeah, a national debate, wasn't it?

254
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,144
You all know?

255
00:27:31,251 --> 00:27:32,700
You did well, Joke.

256
00:27:34,765 --> 00:27:37,710
Your grandma always fills us in.

257
00:27:43,545 --> 00:27:45,991
It’s a team win, nothing major.

258
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:48,286
Still, it’s something to celebrate.

259
00:27:48,623 --> 00:27:53,118
Grandma mentioned one of your close friends got you on the team.

260
00:27:53,495 --> 00:27:57,202
Who was it? Why not invite him for dinner?

261
00:28:00,001 --> 00:28:04,076
It’s not a good time now. He’s got a lot on his plate lately.

262
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,523
It’s great… seeing you get your act together, finally.

263
00:28:24,353 --> 00:28:25,854
Who’s at the door?

264
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,720
Let me check.

265
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:49,633
Zo!

266
00:28:52,942 --> 00:28:54,106
What are you doing here?

267
00:28:55,622 --> 00:28:56,443
Why?

268
00:28:57,204 --> 00:28:59,749
Aren't you glad to see me?

269
00:29:01,302 --> 00:29:04,878
I am, but I mean…

270
00:29:05,821 --> 00:29:07,127
How'd you know I was here?

271
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:12,049
I stopped by your apartment and ran into Jeng.

272
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:16,775
He said you might need a friend.

273
00:29:17,947 --> 00:29:19,172
So I'm here.

274
00:29:20,485 --> 00:29:21,969
Of course, it’s Jeng.

275
00:29:26,049 --> 00:29:26,961
What about you?

276
00:29:27,486 --> 00:29:29,782
Are you feeling any better?

277
00:29:31,398 --> 00:29:32,217
Yeah,

278
00:29:34,896 --> 00:29:36,235
but first,

279
00:29:36,704 --> 00:29:38,967
aren’t you gonna invite me in?

280
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:44,096
My whole family is here.

281
00:29:44,622 --> 00:29:45,639
You okay with that?

282
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:47,481
Of course,

283
00:29:48,374 --> 00:29:49,487
I’ll be fine.

284
00:29:50,268 --> 00:29:52,478
Shall we?

285
00:29:54,789 --> 00:29:55,723
Okay.

286
00:30:12,765 --> 00:30:16,451
Everyone, this is Zo,

287
00:30:16,959 --> 00:30:18,644
the mysterious friend Ma wanted to meet.

288
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:20,811
Hello.

289
00:30:20,811 --> 00:30:22,667
I was just talking about you.

290
00:30:22,667 --> 00:30:23,735
Please, eat with us.

291
00:30:23,735 --> 00:30:25,776
Let me get you a plate. Just a moment.

292
00:30:25,776 --> 00:30:26,753
Thank you.

293
00:30:33,898 --> 00:30:34,827
Sit here.

294
00:30:35,273 --> 00:30:37,158
Grab a seat.

295
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:41,515
Here you go.

296
00:30:43,099 --> 00:30:45,913
Here’s the rice. Please, have a feast.

297
00:30:45,913 --> 00:30:46,964
Thank you.

298
00:30:47,956 --> 00:30:51,453
I didn’t mean to intrude.

299
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,771
Not at all. Make yourself at home.

300
00:30:53,771 --> 00:30:55,555
How’d you end up at our doorstep, anyway?

301
00:30:55,892 --> 00:31:00,387
I dropped by Joke’s apartment and bumped into Jeng.

302
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:02,426
He told me that Joke’s here.

303
00:31:03,248 --> 00:31:04,985
Ah, Jeng.

304
00:31:06,819 --> 00:31:07,904
Please eat, dear.

305
00:31:07,904 --> 00:31:08,404
Yes, ma’am.

306
00:31:08,404 --> 00:31:13,430
Grandma said you’re quite the student and debater.

307
00:31:14,234 --> 00:31:15,471
You just got the win, huh?

308
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:16,733
Yes, sir.

309
00:31:17,433 --> 00:31:21,455
How’s Joke been in college?

310
00:31:22,357 --> 00:31:24,147
He's not causing you any trouble, is he?

311
00:31:25,837 --> 00:31:30,017
If he's messing up, don't sugarcoat it for his sake.

312
00:31:30,565 --> 00:31:34,902
You don’t need to cover for him. I know he’s up to no good.

313
00:31:36,435 --> 00:31:40,168
He’s been acting like a drifter, never really taken anything seriously.

314
00:31:41,125 --> 00:31:44,044
Every suggestion for study I gave him, he’d shrug off.

315
00:31:44,707 --> 00:31:48,771
Be honest. I won’t get upset.

316
00:31:54,564 --> 00:31:59,531
Actually, that doesn’t sound like the Joke I know at all.

317
00:32:00,613 --> 00:32:04,267
He’s really come through for me in many ways.

318
00:32:04,267 --> 00:32:05,073
Zo…

319
00:32:07,221 --> 00:32:08,301
Him, seriously?

320
00:32:08,958 --> 00:32:09,878
That’s right.

321
00:32:10,622 --> 00:32:13,771
To be honest, my first impression of him was not a good one.

322
00:32:15,007 --> 00:32:17,007
But the more I got to know Joke,

323
00:32:17,681 --> 00:32:20,311
the clearer it became that he’s a genuinely good guy.

324
00:32:21,782 --> 00:32:25,771
He might not be the golden boy you pictured,

325
00:32:27,128 --> 00:32:31,912
but to me, he’s pretty much perfect.

326
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:40,970
I used to think I could never be the son my mom would brag about.

327
00:32:42,888 --> 00:32:44,757
Always felt like I wasn’t good enough.

328
00:32:47,524 --> 00:32:49,524
But the day my dad was hospitalized,

329
00:32:50,295 --> 00:32:52,768
I had a chance to have a heart-to-heart with my mom.

330
00:32:55,706 --> 00:32:59,518
Turns out, she was always proud,

331
00:33:01,171 --> 00:33:02,672
she just never said it out loud.

332
00:33:08,812 --> 00:33:12,046
Maybe Joke needs to hear some kind words from you,

333
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,229
like the ones you just gave me.

334
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,217
Zo…

335
00:33:20,423 --> 00:33:22,468
You can be mad at me for speaking so frankly.

336
00:33:24,622 --> 00:33:26,071
But your dad loves you.

337
00:33:28,024 --> 00:33:30,208
Why else would he surprise you after your debate win?

338
00:33:30,982 --> 00:33:32,693
He just doesn’t say it.

339
00:33:40,765 --> 00:33:42,765
I’m sorry for saying all this.

340
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:45,614
My dad just got out of ICU.

341
00:33:48,198 --> 00:33:50,198
I've realized time's fleeting.

342
00:33:52,729 --> 00:33:58,931
I don't want Joke grappling with regrets like I did.

343
00:34:01,731 --> 00:34:03,153
I hope you get where I'm coming from.

344
00:34:16,693 --> 00:34:18,036
He won’t.

345
00:34:20,034 --> 00:34:20,846
Hey!

346
00:34:21,818 --> 00:34:22,691
Let’s go!

347
00:34:32,036 --> 00:34:32,712
Joke!

348
00:34:48,206 --> 00:34:49,740
Take a leap.

349
00:34:50,854 --> 00:34:53,771
Be a man and show that courage.

350
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:06,697
Can we share a hug, Joke?

351
00:35:17,206 --> 00:35:18,046
Yes, Pa.

352
00:35:41,981 --> 00:35:46,187
I’m at a loss for words right now.

353
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:50,489
If you ever felt I didn’t care for you,

354
00:35:53,246 --> 00:35:54,368
you’re wrong.

355
00:35:59,174 --> 00:36:01,091
I love you just like your brothers.

356
00:36:04,189 --> 00:36:08,185
As a middle child, you’ve always been my wild card,

357
00:36:10,743 --> 00:36:12,953
and it's made me worry about your future.

358
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,220
I made my mark in the university debate scene.

359
00:36:42,142 --> 00:36:44,142
I wanted to make you proud.

360
00:36:49,059 --> 00:36:49,806
Joke.

361
00:36:54,349 --> 00:36:55,996
I've always been proud of you, son.

362
00:36:58,315 --> 00:36:59,685
Without fail, at any given time.

363
00:37:02,557 --> 00:37:07,446
I’m so happy that you're my kid.

364
00:37:21,312 --> 00:37:22,839
Now, let's get back to the meal.

365
00:37:24,026 --> 00:37:25,140
Join us, Zo.

366
00:37:30,753 --> 00:37:31,770
Let’s eat.

367
00:37:34,054 --> 00:37:35,291
Dig in.

368
00:37:43,941 --> 00:37:46,834
I could use a tissue. What about your blouse, Grandma?

369
00:37:46,834 --> 00:37:47,676
No, you can’t.

370
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:07,435
Thank you

371
00:38:10,901 --> 00:38:12,776
for finally making me feel good in my own home.

372
00:38:15,849 --> 00:38:17,324
Jeng filled me in on everything.

373
00:38:19,251 --> 00:38:20,857
I didn’t do much, really.

374
00:38:22,206 --> 00:38:25,703
I was just there for you, the way you've always been for me.

375
00:38:27,189 --> 00:38:27,961
That’s all.

376
00:38:34,474 --> 00:38:38,171
I'm sorry I pulled away for a bit.

377
00:38:40,496 --> 00:38:41,971
I was lost.

378
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:50,625
Didn’t know where to turn or what I wanted.

379
00:38:53,544 --> 00:38:54,304
That's okay.

380
00:38:56,221 --> 00:38:57,881
The important thing is you're here with me now, right?

381
00:39:01,411 --> 00:39:02,477
How are you holding up?

382
00:39:05,366 --> 00:39:06,694
I had a chat with my mom.

383
00:39:08,993 --> 00:39:13,465
She reminded me to cherish the one

384
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,699
who've stood by me through thick and thin.

385
00:39:19,955 --> 00:39:21,234
So, here I am, with you.

386
00:39:37,528 --> 00:39:38,397
I love you,

387
00:39:40,971 --> 00:39:41,892
Joke.

388
00:39:51,791 --> 00:39:52,867
I love you, too,

389
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:54,715
Zo.

390
00:40:16,913 --> 00:40:17,784
Thank you.

391
00:40:30,585 --> 00:40:33,291
Why're you staring at me like that?

392
00:40:34,899 --> 00:40:36,899
You didn't have to drop me here, you know.

393
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:38,131
I can handle myself.

394
00:40:38,746 --> 00:40:39,525
What?

395
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:41,659
You didn't want me to give you a ride or something?

396
00:40:41,997 --> 00:40:43,045
It's not that.

397
00:40:43,997 --> 00:40:45,115
I was just worried—

398
00:40:45,115 --> 00:40:45,996
Look, I'm not embarrassed.

399
00:40:47,165 --> 00:40:51,350
I've never been shy about us, and I’m no longer scared.

400
00:40:53,316 --> 00:40:54,984
Though, I might be a bit embarrassed

401
00:40:57,479 --> 00:40:59,119
about what you're wearing today.

402
00:41:00,171 --> 00:41:01,275
Who are you supposed to be?

403
00:41:03,211 --> 00:41:04,909
The prime minister!

404
00:41:06,701 --> 00:41:08,784
This is our club's senior farewell party.

405
00:41:09,177 --> 00:41:11,691
What about you? Why are you in costume?

406
00:41:12,766 --> 00:41:16,211
I thought I’d join you. You said you were feeling insecure.

407
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:18,525
This isn't my everyday look, okay?

408
00:41:19,828 --> 00:41:22,630
No problems from me.

409
00:41:24,317 --> 00:41:25,552
You look adorable, actually.

410
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:29,274
Go on in.

411
00:41:29,965 --> 00:41:31,757
I think everyone's inside.

412
00:41:36,212 --> 00:41:36,932
Pok!

413
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:47,658
What was that?

414
00:41:48,141 --> 00:41:49,027
A little kiss.

415
00:41:51,046 --> 00:41:56,291
Just another way to tell you that I love you.

416
00:42:00,165 --> 00:42:05,373
Now everyone in the party knows you're taken.

417
00:42:09,312 --> 00:42:12,916
Be sure to come straight home after the party, okay, honey?

418
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:17,895
Off you go.

419
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,225
You go first.

420
00:42:21,521 --> 00:42:23,161
Just walk in.

421
00:42:24,108 --> 00:42:26,108
I'll be out here, making sure no one tries to make a move.

422
00:42:27,683 --> 00:42:29,019
Watch your step!

[NOVA Championship Award]

424
00:42:54,348 --> 00:42:55,850
Well, if it isn't Mr. CEO.

425
00:42:58,843 --> 00:43:00,235
You look great today.

426
00:43:00,462 --> 00:43:01,419
Of course.

427
00:43:01,811 --> 00:43:04,731
It's a Dream Job theme party after all. I can wear whatever I want.

428
00:43:05,582 --> 00:43:07,582
But let’s be honest,

429
00:43:08,251 --> 00:43:09,809
it's not the outfit that makes me look this good;

430
00:43:11,354 --> 00:43:12,746
it’s all in the face!

431
00:43:12,962 --> 00:43:14,602
Well, someone's full of themselves today!

432
00:43:25,101 --> 00:43:26,363
Good evening, Mr. Sitang.

433
00:43:27,248 --> 00:43:30,669
Damn, Pok! Going all out, huh?

434
00:43:31,891 --> 00:43:34,011
The name's Pokchat, the Prime Minister.

435
00:43:35,224 --> 00:43:36,344
A bit of respect would be nice.

436
00:43:37,616 --> 00:43:38,692
Of course,

437
00:43:39,798 --> 00:43:41,204
His Excellency, Mr. Pokchat Dickhead!

438
00:43:41,204 --> 00:43:43,931
Hey! What was that for?

439
00:43:43,931 --> 00:43:45,110
For being a little extra.

440
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:47,371
I mean, a guy can dream, right?

441
00:43:47,919 --> 00:43:51,291
What's your costume anyway? Is being a vampire your dream job?

442
00:43:52,486 --> 00:43:54,623
Not a bad idea,

443
00:43:55,867 --> 00:43:59,546
but I’m the CEO.

444
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:01,193
Wow!

445
00:44:02,714 --> 00:44:04,251
So cool!

446
00:44:04,251 --> 00:44:05,213
Of course.

447
00:44:06,286 --> 00:44:07,401
Evening, everyone.

448
00:44:07,401 --> 00:44:08,531
Hey there!

449
00:44:08,531 --> 00:44:09,824
How’s everyone this evening?

450
00:44:09,824 --> 00:44:11,348
All good. How about you?

451
00:44:11,486 --> 00:44:12,606
Wonderful.

452

453
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,455
Beautiful.

454
00:44:19,011 --> 00:44:19,812
Zo,

455
00:44:20,752 --> 00:44:21,951
everything okay?

456
00:44:24,705 --> 00:44:25,462
Yeah,

457
00:44:27,287 --> 00:44:28,226
I’m good.

458
00:44:29,631 --> 00:44:33,456
I just wanted to congratulate Nita on her scholarship.

459
00:44:34,525 --> 00:44:36,082
- You sure you want—
- I got this.

460
00:44:38,317 --> 00:44:39,330
It’s cool.

461
00:44:40,519 --> 00:44:43,165
Just wanted to say congrats to Nita.

462
00:44:45,364 --> 00:44:46,271
That’s all.

463
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:50,159
Be right back.

464

Planning to run a vineyard?

465
00:45:00,432 --> 00:45:01,354
Evening.

466
00:45:04,773 --> 00:45:08,377
Nita, can we talk real quick?

467
00:45:14,885 --> 00:45:16,581
It’s been a while, Zo.

468
00:45:18,241 --> 00:45:20,851
A while indeed.

469
00:45:22,923 --> 00:45:28,870
I haven't had the chance to congratulate you on your scholarship.

470
00:45:32,818 --> 00:45:36,394
A big congrats, Nita. Great work.

471
00:45:38,957 --> 00:45:40,183
Thanks so much, Zo.

472
00:45:41,705 --> 00:45:44,894
I thought you’d be salty about it.

473
00:45:45,494 --> 00:45:48,600
I know how much you wanted that scholarship.

474
00:45:49,593 --> 00:45:52,340
I can’t say I wasn’t bummed at first.

475
00:45:53,715 --> 00:45:59,614
But, you know, I was in a weird place back then.

476
00:46:00,692 --> 00:46:04,011
It's all good now.

477
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:12,711
Don't feel bad. I'm okay.

478
00:46:16,395 --> 00:46:18,395
I went through a lot and realized

479
00:46:19,327 --> 00:46:26,582
the scholarship isn’t the only thing important in my life.

480
00:46:30,196 --> 00:46:33,571
And, honestly, you totally deserved it.

481
00:46:39,009 --> 00:46:40,428
Thanks, that means a lot, Zo.

482
00:46:42,095 --> 00:46:45,257
Without you, I couldn’t have done it either.

483
00:46:47,132 --> 00:46:48,113
Truly grateful.

484
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:52,589
Don’t sweat it.

485
00:46:56,467 --> 00:46:58,695
I have to go.

486
00:46:59,469 --> 00:47:00,419
Catch you later.

487
00:47:00,419 --> 00:47:01,287
See you.

488
00:47:14,099 --> 00:47:15,822
So, should I be feeling jealous vibes about Nita?

489
00:47:18,199 --> 00:47:19,757
Don't be ridiculous.

490
00:47:20,399 --> 00:47:22,759
I've chosen my person.

491
00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:29,519
Humor me, who's that?

492
00:47:36,196 --> 00:47:39,026

00:47:51,409 --> 00:47:53,236
Sure.

00:47:54,590 --> 00:47:55,953
Over there.

497
00:48:03,543 --> 00:48:05,543
Good evening, Debate Club family.

498
00:48:06,857 --> 00:48:10,212
Tonight might be our last official hangout.

499
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:15,081

00:48:15,081 --> 00:48:18,367
You've played a big part in getting us to where we are now.

501
00:48:19,166 --> 00:48:21,166
So give yourselves a round of applause.

502
00:48:27,798 --> 00:48:32,571
Now, before we part ways, I want to sing a song to commemorate

503
00:48:32,814 --> 00:48:36,639

I was watching the video of you singing at the farewell party.

526
00:52:05,433 --> 00:52:10,011
Man, it really took me back to our college days.

527
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:12,276

What are you talking about?

533

You don't remember?

534
00:52:32,309 --> 00:52:35,526
I do, but why'd you bring it up?

535

When you kissed me that time,

536
00:52:41,213 --> 00:52:42,646
you weren’t sure of me.

537
00:52:44,001 --> 00:52:46,462
You weren't sure of us.

538
00:52:48,011 --> 00:52:49,566
How about a redo of that moment?

539
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:51,421
What redo?

540
00:52:56,288 --> 00:52:59,836
Kiss me, this time with the certainty we have in each other now.

541
00:53:04,193 --> 00:53:05,258

00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:09,004
And this rabbit learned that being open and honest with his feelings,

551
00:54:09,004 --> 00:54:13,333
with no hidden agenda, was always better than keeping them bottled up.

552
00:54:14,018 --> 00:54:16,654
In the end, regardless of the outcome,

553
00:54:17,061 --> 00:54:21,273
it mattered that he took a chance with someone he truly cared about.

554
00:54:22,923 --> 00:54:24,563
Time flies, huh?

555
00:54:25,319 --> 00:54:28,508
Feels like it was just yesterday that we got here.

556
00:54:31,134 --> 00:54:35,125
We’ve been through a lot together.

557
00:54:36,216 --> 00:54:37,829
It’s beyond my dream

558
00:54:41,347 --> 00:54:42,877
to be here with you.

559
00:54:45,307 --> 00:54:48,524
And what about you? What's your dream now?

560
00:54:51,554 --> 00:54:57,675
Well, my dream is a lot simpler now.

561
00:54:59,595 --> 00:55:00,609
Oh? What's that?

562
00:55:06,195 --> 00:55:16,363
Just being by your side like this. Forever.

563
00:55:19,375 --> 00:55:20,822
That’s my dream.
