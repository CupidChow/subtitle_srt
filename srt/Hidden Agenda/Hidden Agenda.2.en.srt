1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:00,877
You like Nita?

2
00:00:00,877 --> 00:00:02,320
You can barely bring yourself to walk past her,

3
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,495
and yet you want to chase after her?

4
00:00:03,495 --> 00:00:05,496
You! What's your beef with me?

5
00:00:05,496 --> 00:00:06,677
You don’t want me anywhere near Nita.

6
00:00:06,677 --> 00:00:07,666
I’m not keeping Nita away from you.

7
00:00:07,666 --> 00:00:09,374
We're not getting back together.

8
00:00:09,374 --> 00:00:12,076
If you think you don't stand a chance with Nita, just give up.

9
00:00:12,724 --> 00:00:13,597
You asshole!

10
00:00:14,226 --> 00:00:14,953
Why are you here?

11
00:00:14,953 --> 00:00:16,402
I came to apologize for yesterday.

12
00:00:16,402 --> 00:00:19,173
I know you don't like me very much.

13
00:00:19,173 --> 00:00:20,512
Who said I don’t like you?

14
00:00:20,512 --> 00:00:21,563
Fine, I’ve forgiven you.

15
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:23,582
I will teach you how to pursue someone.

16
00:00:23,582 --> 00:00:25,418
But I won’t do this for free.

17
00:00:25,418 --> 00:00:26,522
You will charge me?

18
00:00:26,522 --> 00:00:27,022
No.

19
00:00:27,022 --> 00:00:28,838
But I want to join the debate club.

20
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:29,607
Why?

21
00:00:35,488 --> 00:00:36,676
What are we doing here?

22
00:00:38,476 --> 00:00:39,247
Eating.

23
00:00:39,608 --> 00:00:41,536
Yeah, I figured that.

24
00:00:53,417 --> 00:00:55,000
I’ll be back to take your orders in a moment.

25
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:00,961
A Vietnamese restaurant.

26
00:01:01,999 --> 00:01:03,034
What else could it be?

27
00:01:04,116 --> 00:01:05,893
What do you want to have? Let's order.

28
00:01:06,267 --> 00:01:07,560
I'm not familiar with this type of food.

29
00:01:07,993 --> 00:01:09,333
Just get it in your mouth,

30
00:01:09,626 --> 00:01:10,475
chew,

31
00:01:11,287 --> 00:01:12,564
and swallow.

32
00:01:12,564 --> 00:01:14,170
Joke, this is not funny.

33
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:20,190
And we haven't finished our conversation yet.

34
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,487
What’s more to say?

35
00:01:22,569 --> 00:01:23,720
Think about it.

36
00:01:23,934 --> 00:01:29,091
If I'm part of the debate club, I could be the bridge that connects you and Nita.

37
00:01:30,394 --> 00:01:32,646
Plus,

38
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,254
my tongue's always getting me into trouble.

39
00:01:38,975 --> 00:01:42,406
Maybe joining the club will let something good come out of my mouth.

40
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:51,942
I haven't even brought up the subject of your joining the club.

41
00:01:52,627 --> 00:01:53,270
Oh?

42
00:01:54,059 --> 00:01:56,280
There goes my chance to help you.

43
00:01:57,336 --> 00:01:59,832
But that's okay, even if it stings a bit.

44
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:03,977
We can stay as just classmates.

45
00:02:07,134 --> 00:02:09,600
I guess I could talk to Wave about it.

46
00:02:13,681 --> 00:02:18,680
But if you manage to join the debate club, you have to help me.

47
00:02:22,697 --> 00:02:23,502
Joke!

48
00:02:28,396 --> 00:02:30,120
If you can eat the dish I’m about to order…

49
00:02:31,316 --> 00:02:32,752
I've told you, I don't know how to eat this stuff.

50
00:02:33,385 --> 00:02:34,280
No deal, then.

51
00:03:25,127 --> 00:03:25,836
Hello.

52
00:03:26,287 --> 00:03:27,127
Hi there.

53
00:03:27,259 --> 00:03:30,905
Are there any openings on 10 May?

54
00:03:31,332 --> 00:03:33,332
I'm planning to bring my family.

55
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:35,905
We only have three spots left. Should I reserve them?

56
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:37,690
Yes, please do.

57
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,344
Hey, kid. Are you going to order anything or not?

58
00:03:42,344 --> 00:03:45,016
If not, step aside. The guy behind you wants to order.

59
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:48,684
Yes, I’d like to order please.

60
00:03:48,685 --> 00:03:51,970
May I have basil chicken with a fried egg over rice, without the basil?

61
00:03:54,111 --> 00:03:55,000
How is the reservation coming along?

62
00:03:56,359 --> 00:03:57,583
Thank you very much.

63
00:03:59,057 --> 00:04:01,328
Basil chicken with a fried egg over rice, without the basil.

64
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,440
You always order the same thing.

65
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,612
Yes, I do.

66
00:04:14,427 --> 00:04:15,206
Dig in.

67
00:04:16,469 --> 00:04:17,234
Come on.

68
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,380
I can eat anything here, right?

69
00:04:21,712 --> 00:04:24,095
Can't I just have this drink and be done with it?

70
00:04:29,277 --> 00:04:29,949
Give it a try.

71
00:04:31,277 --> 00:04:32,605
It's delicious, trust me.

72
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,160
Joke, I can’t.

73
00:04:37,784 --> 00:04:39,784
Dip it in the sauce. It can help with the smell.

74
00:04:43,388 --> 00:04:44,847
Give it a go. It's really good.

75
00:04:45,472 --> 00:04:46,458
Don't you trust me?

76
00:04:47,698 --> 00:04:48,960
I promise you, it's delicious.

77
00:04:50,793 --> 00:04:52,049
For Nita!

78
00:05:05,186 --> 00:05:07,186
You're overreacting. It's really tasty.

79
00:05:09,306 --> 00:05:12,095
Can you make fresh spring rolls?

80
00:05:12,951 --> 00:05:13,875
Fresh spring rolls?

81
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:14,590
Yes, ma'am.

82
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:16,406
This is a small food stall.

83
00:05:16,406 --> 00:05:19,297
We can't make every dish a customer asks for.

84
00:05:21,078 --> 00:05:21,823
Oh...

85
00:05:22,838 --> 00:05:24,520
there was no need to be mean about it.

86
00:05:26,764 --> 00:05:29,320
How much is the basil dish?

87
00:05:29,631 --> 00:05:30,440
40 baht.

88
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:39,417
Here you go.

89
00:05:40,184 --> 00:05:41,259
Wait a moment.

90
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:54,820
Zo!

91
00:05:56,015 --> 00:05:56,736
Zo!

92
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:57,806
Zo!

93
00:05:59,563 --> 00:06:01,563
Are you going to actually eat that or just play with it?

94
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,499
Hey,

95
00:06:07,559 --> 00:06:10,200
I asked Joke to help me win over Nita.

96
00:06:10,408 --> 00:06:11,265
What did he say?

97
00:06:12,167 --> 00:06:18,800
He agreed to help, but only if he could join the debate club.

98
00:06:19,088 --> 00:06:20,637
Doesn't that seem strange to you?

99
00:06:20,858 --> 00:06:21,512
Yes, it does.

100
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,286
Right?

101
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,600
But don't overthink it. He might just want to help.

102
00:06:26,722 --> 00:06:27,509
You think so?

103
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:29,376
Did you mention this to Wave yet?

104
00:06:29,601 --> 00:06:32,960
You shouldn't have any issues. You're his golden boy.

105
00:06:34,179 --> 00:06:38,254
He's my peer mentor. Of course, he's nice to me.

106
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,720
Piece of cake, then!

107
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,834
You betcha!

108
00:06:43,834 --> 00:06:45,180
Let's eat. I'm starving.

109
00:06:46,601 --> 00:06:47,257
No!

110
00:06:47,753 --> 00:06:52,000
Wave, Joke wants to join the club to improve himself.

111
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,233
Improve himself or…

112
00:06:54,561 --> 00:06:55,385
It’s a no.

113
00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:00,080
Wave, why can’t he join?

114
00:07:00,327 --> 00:07:02,665
The recruitment period was over.

115
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:05,960
How’s your assignment coming along, Zo?

116
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,651
Hmm?

117
00:07:06,651 --> 00:07:09,405
The VTR that we discussed in our last meeting.

118
00:07:09,405 --> 00:07:11,181
I've started working on that.

119
00:07:11,641 --> 00:07:12,814
Did you send the information to Som-O?

120
00:07:13,445 --> 00:07:16,279
We need that to post on the club’s page.

121
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:20,408
Oh, right. I’ve emailed it.

122
00:07:20,408 --> 00:07:21,167
Let’s look at it right now.

123
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:23,360
Alright, everyone, let's start the meeting.

124
00:07:35,761 --> 00:07:38,843
This is the rough draft of our VTR.
[VTR to promote the debate club]

125
00:07:39,309 --> 00:07:42,707
I will be the MC

126
00:07:42,707 --> 00:07:46,375
and Wave and Nita will introduce the club.

127
00:07:47,382 --> 00:07:49,960
I think Pok should be the MC.

128
00:07:50,327 --> 00:07:51,899
Zo, you should be on camera with me and Nita.

129
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:54,279
You can introduce other parts of the club.

130
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:00,195
I have a question.

131
00:08:00,195 --> 00:08:06,320
I overheard Wave and Zo talking about Joke wanting to join our club.

132
00:08:06,594 --> 00:08:08,280
Sorry for the eavesdropping.

133
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:11,109
But I joined after the recruitment period was over too.

134
00:08:11,109 --> 00:08:14,540
Shouldn't that same rule apply to everyone?

135
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:18,475
Also, we need more members.

136
00:08:19,167 --> 00:08:20,360
What do you all think?

137
00:08:20,608 --> 00:08:23,332
Wait a minute, Joke? Joke from Public Administration?

138
00:08:25,014 --> 00:08:25,922
I think he should join.

139
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:28,818
Actually, we should open another recruitment round.

140
00:08:28,973 --> 00:08:32,400
Joke is good-looking. He could be good for the VTR as well.

141
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,756
But does he have any debate experience?

142
00:08:35,846 --> 00:08:38,066
I rarely see him talk to anyone.

143
00:08:40,321 --> 00:08:42,321
Will we have time to finish the VTR?

144
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:47,400
Joining this club requires skills.

145
00:08:48,404 --> 00:08:53,020
Everyone must take a test as per the rules, no exceptions.

146
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:58,092
So, if Joke passes the test, he can join the club.

147
00:09:09,233 --> 00:09:10,000
Pok!

148
00:09:20,781 --> 00:09:21,782
Here are the lecture notes.

149
00:09:23,067 --> 00:09:24,449
Thanks so much, Zo.

150
00:09:24,681 --> 00:09:27,840
I completely forgot I'd asked you for them.

151
00:09:28,466 --> 00:09:30,173
Good thing I ran into you in time.

152
00:09:32,198 --> 00:09:34,401
Are you in a rush to go somewhere?

153
00:09:35,753 --> 00:09:37,560
I have an appointment, so I need to hurry.

154
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:39,592
Who are you meeting?

155
00:09:41,617 --> 00:09:42,696
Never mind.

156
00:09:43,733 --> 00:09:47,800
Feel free to ask me for notes on any subject.

157
00:09:48,634 --> 00:09:49,482
Thank you so much.

158
00:09:50,634 --> 00:09:54,800
Hey, when did you and Joke become friends?

159
00:09:56,921 --> 00:09:58,921
More like acquaintances.

160
00:09:59,288 --> 00:10:00,400
Just recently?

161
00:10:00,817 --> 00:10:01,899
He's asking a lot of questions.

162
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:12,787
We've known each other for a while but just started talking.

163
00:10:13,433 --> 00:10:17,643
Joke wants to join the debate club, so I was asking around.

164
00:10:20,811 --> 00:10:23,149
My peer mentor is the best!

165
00:10:23,149 --> 00:10:23,911
No doubt about that.

166
00:10:24,614 --> 00:10:25,465
Every time I give you a compliment...

167
00:10:27,496 --> 00:10:29,120
Weren't you in a hurry?

168
00:10:29,368 --> 00:10:30,116
Right.

169
00:10:30,116 --> 00:10:31,365
Go ahead.

170
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:32,815
See you later.

171
00:10:33,429 --> 00:10:35,800
Hey, one more thing.

172
00:10:36,062 --> 00:10:40,000
I didn't mention to Wave yet that I have a friend who can shoot videos.

173
00:10:40,588 --> 00:10:41,844
He can shoot, huh?

174
00:10:42,681 --> 00:10:45,425
Could he help us out?

175
00:10:48,616 --> 00:10:50,200
I can ask him.

176
00:10:50,612 --> 00:10:52,973
Great, thanks.

177
00:10:53,539 --> 00:10:55,877
I've got to go. See you later.

178
00:10:55,877 --> 00:10:56,529
See ya.

179
00:10:56,529 --> 00:10:57,029
Bye.

180
00:10:57,029 --> 00:10:57,556
Take care.

181
00:11:16,999 --> 00:11:18,031
Hey, Joke.

182
00:11:19,564 --> 00:11:21,826
Meet me at the debate club,

183
00:11:23,066 --> 00:11:23,870
now.

184
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,424
What am I doing here?

185
00:11:54,092 --> 00:11:55,520
Didn't you want to join the club?

186
00:11:56,502 --> 00:11:58,234
You’re not allowed inside yet.

187
00:12:03,964 --> 00:12:04,788
Come on in.

188
00:12:16,865 --> 00:12:18,295
Now that we’re here when no one’s around,

189
00:12:19,348 --> 00:12:20,080
what's next?

190
00:12:20,252 --> 00:12:22,851
I will make sure you can get in.

191
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:24,931
What does that mean?

192
00:12:26,252 --> 00:12:27,592
And what am I supposed to do?

193
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:33,120
You will debate in front of Wave, my club president.

194
00:12:35,626 --> 00:12:39,960
You will get in if you have the votes of the members.

195
00:12:42,173 --> 00:12:43,760
Why is it so complicated?

196
00:12:44,351 --> 00:12:45,233
It just is.

197
00:12:45,914 --> 00:12:46,908
Do you want in or not?

198
00:12:49,968 --> 00:12:52,320
Coming here doesn’t makes me more eloquent.

199
00:12:54,338 --> 00:12:56,338
You said I needed to debate, right?

200
00:12:56,338 --> 00:12:57,040
Yeah.

201
00:12:58,490 --> 00:12:59,213
How do I rebut?

202
00:13:01,504 --> 00:13:04,742
Is it like when you return a ping pong ball?

203
00:13:05,629 --> 00:13:08,537
Smart ass, you can play ping pong over there.

204
00:13:10,001 --> 00:13:11,913
But first, I need to coach you.

205
00:13:12,057 --> 00:13:13,611
Go, grab a seat.

206
00:13:16,847 --> 00:13:21,138
Good morning, everyone, judges, and members of the opposing team.

207
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:24,459
My name is Jeeranai.

208
00:13:30,295 --> 00:13:31,027
Hey,

209
00:13:32,203 --> 00:13:33,038
wake up!

210
00:13:33,773 --> 00:13:39,364
Good morning, everyone, judges, and members of the opposing team.

211
00:13:40,233 --> 00:13:41,552
Well….

212
00:13:44,142 --> 00:13:47,071
When you speak, look forward.

213
00:13:47,571 --> 00:13:49,393
Sweep your gaze across the room.

214
00:13:50,355 --> 00:13:51,585
Don't just look at me.

215
00:13:53,995 --> 00:13:55,995
Start again, but this time, be more relaxed.

216
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,048
I've had enough.

217
00:13:58,048 --> 00:13:59,108
What's wrong?

218
00:13:59,774 --> 00:14:01,609
I've repeated this line so many times.

219
00:14:02,388 --> 00:14:04,037
But you haven't perfected it yet.

220
00:14:04,401 --> 00:14:06,000
You're still not getting it right.

221
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:10,421
Open your mouth more when you talk. It can help.

222
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,280
If you don't try to get it right, you won't pass the test.

223
00:14:14,412 --> 00:14:16,907
I’ll practice more when I get home.

224
00:14:19,575 --> 00:14:21,575
Are you trying too hard to coach me?

225
00:14:22,366 --> 00:14:24,040
I'm not preparing for a debate championship.

226
00:14:24,171 --> 00:14:25,289
We made a deal,

227
00:14:26,548 --> 00:14:27,905
so I need to focus.

228
00:14:31,594 --> 00:14:32,398
By the way,

229
00:14:34,049 --> 00:14:35,637
how did you end up in this club?

230
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:36,775
Do you enjoy debating?

231
00:14:38,199 --> 00:14:41,058
You could say that.

232
00:14:44,694 --> 00:14:46,694
But there's something I want to show you.

233
00:14:47,396 --> 00:14:48,070
Follow me.

234
00:15:01,089 --> 00:15:01,937
Don't touch.

235
00:15:02,783 --> 00:15:04,038
You can only look.

236
00:15:06,721 --> 00:15:08,721
Isn't it beautiful?

237
00:15:09,896 --> 00:15:13,072
One day, this award will be mine.

238
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,249
[NOVA Champion]

239
00:15:31,815 --> 00:15:35,611
And the winner of NOVA,

240
00:15:35,721 --> 00:15:40,239
the national debate competition among the political science faculties, is….

241
00:15:41,798 --> 00:15:43,199
Zo!

242
00:16:01,784 --> 00:16:03,454
Congratulations on your achievement, Zo.

243
00:16:08,895 --> 00:16:10,895
Thank you, Joke.

244
00:16:21,693 --> 00:16:23,285
Instead of a thank you, how about…

245
00:16:42,898 --> 00:16:44,898
Hey! Where did you drift off to?

246
00:16:46,401 --> 00:16:48,649
Anyway, that's my dream.

247
00:16:49,821 --> 00:16:51,037
Why this one?

248
00:16:52,104 --> 00:16:53,960
You're such a buzzkill.

249
00:16:55,257 --> 00:16:57,814
Never mind. Let's practice some more.

250
00:17:25,942 --> 00:17:26,858
Keep practicing.

251
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:29,201
No.

252
00:17:30,025 --> 00:17:31,881
An army marches on its stomach.

253
00:17:32,233 --> 00:17:34,080
I'm hungry. Let's eat.

254
00:17:36,034 --> 00:17:37,663
An army can also march on its feet.

255
00:17:37,663 --> 00:17:38,761
We need to practice.

256
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:40,939
No, let’s get something to eat.

257
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,099
I'm starving.

258
00:17:45,885 --> 00:17:47,640
Come on! My treat.

259
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,613
All right.

260
00:18:02,634 --> 00:18:06,203
Every time I see you, you're always drinking chrysanthemum tea.

261
00:18:07,616 --> 00:18:08,324
Do you like it?

262
00:18:10,966 --> 00:18:11,840
Yes, I do.

263
00:18:13,529 --> 00:18:16,560
But I'm okay with anything as long as it's not sour.

264
00:18:17,603 --> 00:18:22,389
Kind of like how you always drink roselle juice as if it's your lifeline.

265
00:18:27,979 --> 00:18:28,965
I also like this.

266
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,200
Stir-fried macaroni with squid and salted egg yolk.

267
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:34,256
Want to try some?

268
00:18:35,102 --> 00:18:35,917
No,

269
00:18:36,454 --> 00:18:37,264
you eat yours.

270
00:18:37,966 --> 00:18:39,062
I have mine.

271
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:40,729
If you're not going to try,

272
00:18:42,009 --> 00:18:42,774
I'll feed you.

273
00:18:42,774 --> 00:18:44,353
What are you doing, man?

274
00:18:44,812 --> 00:18:46,720
Just try it. Come on.

275
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,513
It's yours.

276
00:18:47,513 --> 00:18:48,303
Have a bite.

277
00:18:49,219 --> 00:18:49,940
Or I'm going to feed you.

278
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:51,879
It did look tempting at first.

279
00:18:52,175 --> 00:18:54,560
But you forcing it on me makes it less appealing.

280
00:19:04,148 --> 00:19:06,024
How is it? Good, right?

281
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:15,159
It's okay.

282
00:19:16,872 --> 00:19:17,730
It's delicious, huh?

283
00:19:18,793 --> 00:19:19,577
It's fine.

284
00:19:23,106 --> 00:19:26,283
Let's get back to practice after this.

285
00:19:28,696 --> 00:19:29,382
Hey,

286
00:19:29,733 --> 00:19:30,717
I'm human.

287
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,560
I get tired.

288
00:19:33,446 --> 00:19:34,638
You can't expect me to talk all day.

289
00:19:34,782 --> 00:19:38,975
It's just talking. I'm not asking you to do hard labor.

290
00:19:41,371 --> 00:19:42,876
You should learn to find balance.

291
00:19:43,899 --> 00:19:45,899
Nobody becomes good in a day.

292
00:19:46,505 --> 00:19:48,320
I understand that.

293
00:19:48,868 --> 00:19:54,315
Sorry if I pushed you too hard.

294
00:19:57,653 --> 00:20:00,602
No need to apologize, as long as you understand.

295
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:04,360
I understand.

296
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,660
But let's practice more tomorrow.

297
00:20:31,721 --> 00:20:32,848
Thanks for the ride.

298
00:20:34,726 --> 00:20:36,094
See you tomorrow evening.

299
00:20:36,453 --> 00:20:38,453
I’ll be singing at Trin’s place tomorrow night.

300
00:20:39,115 --> 00:20:40,032
Can we reschedule?

301
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:44,035
I'll meet you there.

302
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:46,205
Why would you come there?

303
00:20:46,804 --> 00:20:48,011
It's not the right place for practice.

304
00:20:48,439 --> 00:20:49,760
I'm hired to sing.

305
00:20:52,314 --> 00:20:53,236
You’ll see.

306
00:20:56,621 --> 00:20:57,520
Catch you later.

307
00:20:58,978 --> 00:20:59,754
Bye.

308
00:21:16,766 --> 00:21:17,558
Hello

309
00:21:18,102 --> 00:21:20,516
Hello, hello, hello.

310
00:21:20,516 --> 00:21:22,288
My name is Jeeranai. Hello.

311
00:21:22,932 --> 00:21:26,404
I’m Jeeranai or you can call me Joke.

312
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,650
Today, we will discuss one, two, three, four, five.

313
00:21:32,951 --> 00:21:34,951
Hello, hello.

314
00:21:42,825 --> 00:21:45,038
Hello, hello.

315
00:21:45,417 --> 00:21:46,295
What are you doing?

316
00:21:49,654 --> 00:21:52,244
None of your business.

317
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:54,923
Oh, I know.

318
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:59,044
I heard somebody wanted to join the debate club.

319
00:22:00,465 --> 00:22:02,110
Were you practicing?

320
00:22:03,761 --> 00:22:04,804
How did you find out about that?

321
00:22:05,892 --> 00:22:08,176
I have my ways.

322
00:22:09,415 --> 00:22:13,404
Do you want a way for my foot to land on your face?

323
00:22:16,131 --> 00:22:16,992
I'd rather not.

324
00:22:17,564 --> 00:22:18,514
What are you doing here?

325
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:20,866
I came to give you the key card.

326
00:22:21,102 --> 00:22:22,463
Auntie Mouth left it with me.

327
00:22:22,463 --> 00:22:23,126
Here you go.

328
00:22:25,089 --> 00:22:25,878
Thanks.

329
00:22:27,274 --> 00:22:28,164
Where are you headed?

330
00:22:28,579 --> 00:22:31,164
Nowhere. I’m going straight home after this.

331
00:22:31,164 --> 00:22:32,107
I’m off.

332
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:35,316
Joke, go, go! Joke, go for it!

333
00:22:35,316 --> 00:22:37,513
Joke, go, for it! Joke, go, go!

334
00:22:38,208 --> 00:22:40,989
And yet, you’re still here. Go!

335
00:22:41,499 --> 00:22:43,830
You, go, go!

336
00:22:51,948 --> 00:22:52,844
It’s running low.

337
00:22:52,844 --> 00:22:54,968
Let me know if we run out of anything, okay?

338
00:22:55,205 --> 00:22:56,067
Hello.

339
00:22:56,493 --> 00:22:59,807
Hey, what’s up, Joke, my lovely mentee?

340
00:23:00,978 --> 00:23:02,647
Why are you here so early?

341
00:23:04,148 --> 00:23:05,391
I've got an appointment.

342
00:23:05,724 --> 00:23:06,661
An appointment...

343
00:23:08,601 --> 00:23:09,664
with that dude?

344
00:23:15,429 --> 00:23:16,604
How did you know?

345
00:23:16,743 --> 00:23:17,665
How could I not?

346
00:23:17,924 --> 00:23:20,492
He came, sat down, and said he was waiting for you.

347
00:23:20,492 --> 00:23:21,765
Look at his drink.

348
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:23,044
It's a soda.

349
00:23:23,044 --> 00:23:24,959
This is a bar, for Christ's sake.

350
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,123
Is he Wave’s mentee?

351
00:23:35,255 --> 00:23:36,900
I didn’t know you guys were close.

352
00:23:37,585 --> 00:23:39,325
But be careful of those guys.

353
00:23:46,602 --> 00:23:47,603
Go get ready.

354
00:23:47,816 --> 00:23:49,084
I’ve got things I need to handle.

355
00:23:49,273 --> 00:23:49,952
Sure.

356
00:23:52,286 --> 00:23:53,363
How much is left?

357
00:24:03,172 --> 00:24:04,091
Have a bite first.

358
00:24:07,545 --> 00:24:08,531
Tell me.

359
00:24:09,431 --> 00:24:10,603
Why did you come and meet me here?

360
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:14,804
Let's practice.

361
00:24:14,968 --> 00:24:18,908
No. I've told you, I'm here to sing.

362
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,240
I'm not asking you to practice now.

363
00:24:24,365 --> 00:24:29,487
When you're on stage, do you say something as a segue to a song?

364
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:32,415
Yes.

365
00:24:34,828 --> 00:24:36,023
I say it all the time.

366
00:24:36,212 --> 00:24:36,966
Really?

367
00:24:38,789 --> 00:24:44,479
Say it as you would, and I’ll give it a listen.

368
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:49,964
Also, do you remember the gazing technique I taught you?

369
00:24:51,751 --> 00:24:54,674
Use that when you’re speaking.

370
00:24:56,425 --> 00:24:57,905
How can I compartmentalize?

371
00:24:58,826 --> 00:25:00,004
You can do it.

372
00:25:01,654 --> 00:25:03,914
Just go with your gut.

373
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:09,444
But I need you to be more serious.

374
00:25:10,029 --> 00:25:12,502
Most importantly, extend your speech.

375
00:25:13,847 --> 00:25:17,432
You can talk about the song you're about to sing,

376
00:25:18,138 --> 00:25:19,523
why you picked it.

377
00:25:22,124 --> 00:25:23,364
I don't think I can.

378
00:25:24,076 --> 00:25:25,390
I only know how to entertain.

379
00:25:28,213 --> 00:25:32,720
You can do it. Try to speak from the heart.

380
00:25:40,544 --> 00:25:41,615
Trust me,

381
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:43,987
you can do it.

382
00:25:44,797 --> 00:25:47,483
This is your home turf.

383
00:25:50,099 --> 00:25:52,004
You have nothing to fear.

384
00:25:55,684 --> 00:25:57,684
Trust me, you can do it, Joke.

385
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:02,482
Go for it.

386
00:26:06,101 --> 00:26:06,981
All right.

387
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,323
Rooting for you.

388
00:26:14,141 --> 00:26:16,709
Hi, everyone. I’m Joke.

389
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,417
Normally, I don't say much.

390
00:26:22,724 --> 00:26:24,724
But somebody asked me to speak more today.

391
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:29,908
So I'm going to say something long here.

392
00:26:31,843 --> 00:26:35,144
I don’t think anyone realizes how fast my heart is racing now.

393
00:26:37,735 --> 00:26:43,153
I feel like I have a crush on someone,

394
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,595
and I'm about to confess.

395
00:26:49,471 --> 00:26:52,961
Talking isn't something I'm comfortable with.

396
00:26:54,262 --> 00:26:57,445
Singing, however, is a different story.

397
00:27:01,233 --> 00:27:06,119
This song I'm about to sing really captures what I'm feeling right now.

398
00:27:07,576 --> 00:27:11,989
♪ I know it’d all end up the same no matter what ♪

399
00:27:15,364 --> 00:27:20,581
♪ I know you’d choose them no matter what ♪

400
00:27:22,613 --> 00:27:29,202
♪ I know you’d forget about us no matter how much I beg ♪

401
00:27:29,784 --> 00:27:31,784
♪ Because they are better ♪

402
00:27:32,829 --> 00:27:41,244
♪ But I’ve already fallen in love with you ♪

403
00:27:41,244 --> 00:27:46,083
♪ I know, I know you have to go ♪

404
00:27:47,647 --> 00:27:51,397
♪ But I want to beg you one more time ♪

405
00:27:51,397 --> 00:27:59,411
♪ Please love me, love me, I won't make you sad ♪

406
00:27:59,411 --> 00:28:06,139
♪ I know I can't compete with someone you have ♪

407
00:28:06,139 --> 00:28:13,364
♪ But choose me, choose me, I'll take good care of you ♪

408
00:28:13,784 --> 00:28:22,975
♪ Please ask your heart again, because my heart still only has you ♪

409
00:28:28,472 --> 00:28:30,023
(Great job!)

410
00:28:33,343 --> 00:28:36,029
Your speech on stage was good.

411
00:28:37,452 --> 00:28:38,652
Did you just compliment me?

412
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:39,783
No.

413
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:44,386
I'm just saying it was good enough.

414
00:28:47,903 --> 00:28:48,848
How are you getting back home?

415
00:28:49,416 --> 00:28:50,471
Do you need a ride?

416
00:28:51,351 --> 00:28:54,013
No, thanks. I saw you had a few drinks.

417
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:57,662
It was not even half a glass.

418
00:28:58,115 --> 00:29:00,115
I knew I had to drive.

419
00:29:00,355 --> 00:29:02,237
That's what drunk people say.

420
00:29:03,457 --> 00:29:05,079
I'll give you a ride.

421
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:09,135
I swear I only had a sip.

422
00:29:09,536 --> 00:29:10,569
I can drive, Zo.

423
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:14,124
No, you can’t. It’s too dangerous.

424
00:29:14,584 --> 00:29:16,466
I’ll drive you home.

425
00:29:16,881 --> 00:29:17,764
Why?

426
00:29:18,568 --> 00:29:19,685
Are you worried about me?

427
00:29:19,685 --> 00:29:22,572
Yes, I am.

428
00:29:26,885 --> 00:29:30,924
If anything happens to you, who’s going to help me with Nita?

429
00:29:33,473 --> 00:29:34,295
I see.

430
00:29:36,542 --> 00:29:40,324
Joke, what’s wrong? Are you sulking?

431
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,583
Who’s sulking?

432
00:29:41,884 --> 00:29:42,990
Wait for me!

433
00:30:05,548 --> 00:30:06,562
What on earth are you doing?

434
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:08,589
I've changed my mind. Come here.

435
00:30:09,484 --> 00:30:10,380
Come.

436
00:30:19,944 --> 00:30:20,720
Here.

437
00:30:41,205 --> 00:30:42,032
Okay,

438
00:30:43,262 --> 00:30:44,236
let’s go.

439
00:30:46,294 --> 00:30:47,420
Don’t forget this.

440
00:30:50,152 --> 00:30:51,191
Where is it?

441
00:30:51,522 --> 00:30:52,198
Here, let me.

442
00:30:54,256 --> 00:30:55,724
I feel like I’m helping a child.

443
00:30:57,176 --> 00:30:58,727
Okay, let’s go.

444
00:30:58,916 --> 00:30:59,807
Hold on,

445
00:31:00,588 --> 00:31:03,884
were you messing with me on stage earlier?

446
00:31:05,558 --> 00:31:06,429
No,

447
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:08,035
I wasn’t.

448
00:31:08,484 --> 00:31:10,468
Why were you talking about having a crush?

449
00:31:11,417 --> 00:31:13,244
You said you were done teasing me about Nita.

450
00:31:15,725 --> 00:31:16,672
I just…

451
00:31:18,943 --> 00:31:19,996
I’m feeling the same way.

452
00:31:22,534 --> 00:31:23,848
Feeling the same way?

453
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,538
Are you in love?

454
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,764
Who is your crush?

455
00:31:31,906 --> 00:31:32,602
Tell me who.

456
00:31:33,317 --> 00:31:34,118
Who is it?

457
00:31:35,486 --> 00:31:37,486
Who is it?

458
00:31:37,832 --> 00:31:38,440
I’m not telling you.

459
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:38,987
Who?

460
00:31:39,798 --> 00:31:41,703
Come on, man.

461
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,493
I promise I won’t tell a soul.

462
00:31:46,747 --> 00:31:47,723
Who is it?

463
00:31:51,129 --> 00:31:51,940
I’m not telling you.

464
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:56,161
I told you who my crush was.

465
00:31:57,361 --> 00:31:58,343
You told me voluntarily.

466
00:31:58,698 --> 00:31:59,787
I didn't ask you.

467
00:32:01,111 --> 00:32:01,848
Let’s go.

468
00:32:03,457 --> 00:32:04,862
Never mind.

469
00:32:05,325 --> 00:32:07,916
The debate is tomorrow.

470
00:32:08,934 --> 00:32:10,319
Don't be late.

471
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:14,964
We don't tolerate tardiness. Okay?

472
00:32:18,866 --> 00:32:21,174
Can we go home now? You're talking too much.

473
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,836
I'm tired. Let's go.

474
00:32:24,143 --> 00:32:25,906
Be nicer, or you won't get a ride.

475
00:32:26,541 --> 00:32:27,879
But that's my motorcycle.

476
00:32:32,281 --> 00:32:33,595
That hurts.

477
00:32:37,673 --> 00:32:38,565
Do you know how to ride?

478
00:32:39,085 --> 00:32:40,193
Of course.

479
00:32:42,716 --> 00:32:43,616
Hold on a sec.

480
00:32:45,066 --> 00:32:46,166
Twist it.

481
00:32:46,166 --> 00:32:47,328
I am.

482
00:32:47,539 --> 00:32:49,539
I mean, twist the key.

483
00:32:49,539 --> 00:32:50,473
Oh, I need to twist that.

484
00:32:54,643 --> 00:32:55,396
Let’s go.

485
00:32:56,972 --> 00:32:57,841
Zo!

486
00:33:20,091 --> 00:33:21,056
What’s that?

487
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,020
Huh?

488
00:33:22,932 --> 00:33:24,932
I couldn’t hear you.

489
00:33:24,932 --> 00:33:28,180
I’m just really happy you’re here with me.

490
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:30,679
What? Say it again.

491
00:33:31,382 --> 00:33:33,051
Nothing, just be careful.

492
00:33:38,198 --> 00:33:42,118
Ready? Three, two, one, action!

493
00:33:42,748 --> 00:33:45,886
Hello, We're here representing the debate club.

494
00:33:45,886 --> 00:33:48,406
Today, we’re excited to give you an intro to what we do.

495
00:33:48,565 --> 00:33:50,257
Let's dive right into it.

496
00:33:50,258 --> 00:33:52,884
What does the debate club do?

497
00:33:52,884 --> 00:33:56,466
Our bread and butter is hosting debate events on campus.

498
00:33:56,466 --> 00:33:58,002
But that’s not all we do.

499
00:33:58,002 --> 00:34:03,364
We also have regular meetups to sharpen each other's debating skills.

500
00:34:04,745 --> 00:34:08,884
We also participate in off-campus activities.

501
00:34:09,051 --> 00:34:14,795
Three years ago, we won a national inter-university competition.

502
00:34:16,678 --> 00:34:19,223
And the award was…

503
00:34:20,343 --> 00:34:21,427
Was…

504
00:34:21,964 --> 00:34:23,070
Was…

505
00:34:23,595 --> 00:34:24,559
Was…

506
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,235
Was…

507
00:34:26,482 --> 00:34:27,676
Was…

508
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:31,434
A scholarship to study in Finland.

509
00:34:32,262 --> 00:34:35,186
Woah, that's super exciting!

510
00:34:35,186 --> 00:34:38,658
So, are there any off-campus events on the horizon this year?

511
00:34:39,451 --> 00:34:41,333
Absolutely.

512
00:34:41,497 --> 00:34:45,748
Our club is all set to bring home the championship for our university this year.

513
00:34:46,299 --> 00:34:48,441
So, don't forget to cheer us on!

514
00:35:00,499 --> 00:35:02,167
Hey, why is this class still going on?

515
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:05,397
This teacher always pushes it past the bell.

516
00:35:05,876 --> 00:35:07,484
We're already 10 minutes over time.

517
00:35:07,485 --> 00:35:10,220
I’ve just realized our time is up.

518
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:13,091
Please make sure to finish the assigned reading before our next class.

519
00:35:13,091 --> 00:35:14,293
Class is dismissed!

520
00:35:16,446 --> 00:35:18,043
Where are you dashing off to?

521
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:19,759
Gotta run!

522
00:35:21,394 --> 00:35:22,074
Hey!

523
00:35:29,181 --> 00:35:31,444
Okay, that's a wrap.

524
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:37,884
Wave and Zo, you two were very smooth.

525
00:35:37,884 --> 00:35:40,728
You did a great job as well. Let’s pack up.

526
00:35:49,807 --> 00:35:51,404
Where’s Joke? He’s not here yet?

527
00:35:52,403 --> 00:35:53,924
If he’s not here, I’ll leave.

528
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:06,324
Wave, let me try calling him first.

529
00:36:23,394 --> 00:36:24,260
I’m heading out.

530
00:36:26,108 --> 00:36:27,242
Did I make it in time?

531
00:36:37,716 --> 00:36:38,599
Just in time.

532
00:36:42,272 --> 00:36:43,626
Ready when you are.

533
00:36:46,033 --> 00:36:48,033
Why would you want to join this club?

534
00:36:48,349 --> 00:36:49,543
I don't get it at all.

535
00:36:51,064 --> 00:36:52,313
I'll explain later.

536
00:36:56,105 --> 00:36:57,117
I’m ready.

537
00:36:57,592 --> 00:36:59,204
Who would you like me to debate with?

538
00:36:59,481 --> 00:37:00,492
It’ll be…

539
00:37:02,957 --> 00:37:08,828
Zo on the topic of a relationship with a hidden agenda.

540
00:37:09,524 --> 00:37:10,748
Is it right, or is it wrong?

541
00:37:17,028 --> 00:37:17,994
Why?

542
00:37:19,431 --> 00:37:20,364
What's the problem?

543
00:37:21,431 --> 00:37:22,664
We can skip this test altogether.

544
00:37:28,959 --> 00:37:30,556
Wave, I think…

545
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,335
Never mind.

546
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:39,939
Zo, you go first

547
00:37:40,574 --> 00:37:42,716
as an existing member of our club.

548
00:37:44,658 --> 00:37:47,061
Personally, I think it's wrong.

549
00:37:48,363 --> 00:37:50,644
To start any relationship,

550
00:37:50,762 --> 00:37:53,764
there should be no room for secrets or hidden motives.

551
00:37:55,164 --> 00:38:00,837
If there are, that person could very well harbor ill will.

552
00:38:06,526 --> 00:38:07,625
I disagree.

553
00:38:08,553 --> 00:38:11,856
When you’re starting a relationship with someone,

554
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:17,484
I don’t think we need to declare everything out in the open with the other person.

555
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:20,204
Why?

556
00:38:20,204 --> 00:38:24,844
Don't you think they would be more hurt if they found out later?

557
00:38:26,631 --> 00:38:27,964
That depends on the situation.

558
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:32,804
Some things can come out sooner or later, and it doesn’t really matter.

559
00:38:34,765 --> 00:38:38,068
The timing should be when the person is ready to share it.

560
00:38:40,975 --> 00:38:44,684
But intentionally hiding something...

561
00:38:49,605 --> 00:38:50,560
It can happen.

562
00:38:51,605 --> 00:38:53,859
But we need to consider the reason behind it.

563
00:38:54,212 --> 00:38:55,260
For instance,

564
00:38:55,876 --> 00:38:57,634
let's say I want to get close to a friend.

565
00:38:58,355 --> 00:38:59,691
I happen to hate eating vegetables.

566
00:38:59,691 --> 00:39:02,811
Do I need to announce that right from the start?

567
00:39:07,122 --> 00:39:10,023
There's no harm in telling your friend.

568
00:39:10,509 --> 00:39:12,722
In fact, sharing such things is part of forming a bond.

569
00:39:13,739 --> 00:39:21,124
Knowing your quirks like your dislike for veggies can even strengthen your friendship.

570
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:26,321
It’s not wrong.

571
00:39:28,904 --> 00:39:31,406
But I don’t think it’s necessary.

572
00:39:33,422 --> 00:39:40,328
Say I have a flatulence issue because I often have indigestion.

573
00:39:41,965 --> 00:39:43,491
Should I disclose this to everyone?

574
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:53,219
But that hardly counts as a hidden agenda.

575
00:39:59,337 --> 00:40:00,721
What is it, then?

576
00:40:02,771 --> 00:40:08,207
To me, a hidden agenda is a secret.

577
00:40:10,117 --> 00:40:12,364
Something you can’t tell anyone.

578
00:40:12,364 --> 00:40:14,965
Why wouldn’t flatulence or vegetable-hating count?

579
00:40:24,773 --> 00:40:25,946
Well…

580
00:40:26,538 --> 00:40:27,797
Okay, let's leave it at that.

581
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:35,684
Now, I'd like everyone to cast a vote on the winner of this debate, Joke or Zo.

582
00:40:37,109 --> 00:40:38,484
All in favor of Joke, show of hands, please?

583
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:50,392
And Zo?

584
00:41:01,483 --> 00:41:02,440
It’s a tie.

585
00:41:13,523 --> 00:41:15,262
So, am I in?

586
00:41:25,201 --> 00:41:29,286
Anyone with more than half the votes gets into the club.

587
00:41:38,241 --> 00:41:39,483
That’s all for today, guys.

588
00:42:03,248 --> 00:42:04,750
You were great!

589
00:42:05,749 --> 00:42:07,299
I just followed your advice and spoke from the heart.

590
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:10,068
You did a great job, buddy.

591
00:42:10,992 --> 00:42:11,814
Buddy?

592
00:42:12,829 --> 00:42:18,124
Absolutely, you're the buddy I coached who made it into the club.

593
00:42:18,245 --> 00:42:21,643
Just don't forget the little favor I asked you for.

594
00:42:23,507 --> 00:42:24,452
What favor?

595
00:42:25,305 --> 00:42:28,185
Joke, don’t mess with me.

596
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,849
You very nearly fell flat on your face.

597
00:42:53,917 --> 00:42:55,467
Are you all right?

598
00:42:56,806 --> 00:42:57,602
Yes.

599
00:42:59,024 --> 00:43:00,418
That was a dramatic fall.

600
00:43:06,611 --> 00:43:08,611
You really need to watch where you're going.

601
00:43:10,261 --> 00:43:11,384
What are you doing?

602
00:43:11,656 --> 00:43:14,035
Come here. Let me help.

603
00:43:30,489 --> 00:43:32,110
Just fixing your shoelace.

604
00:43:35,538 --> 00:43:36,590
Thank you.

605
00:43:42,747 --> 00:43:44,747
As clumsy as ever, I see.

606
00:43:47,826 --> 00:43:49,328
So, you'll help me, right?

607
00:43:51,833 --> 00:43:55,705
Help with Nita?

608
00:43:57,955 --> 00:43:58,832
What else?

609
00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:03,936
Don't tell me you've already forgotten your promise to help me win over Nita.

610
00:44:11,575 --> 00:44:12,743
Well…

611
00:44:14,947 --> 00:44:16,309
I’ve actually already started.

612
00:44:34,407 --> 00:44:35,672
When?

613
00:44:48,064 --> 00:44:51,524
Rule no. 1, know your personality.

614
00:44:51,524 --> 00:44:55,050
If you want to catch someone's eye, you've got to stand out from the crowd.

615
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:57,771
Try asking me out.

616
00:44:58,205 --> 00:44:59,944
Would you like to go on a date with me?

617
00:45:01,442 --> 00:45:03,442
Remember, the key is to make her heart flutter.

618
00:45:03,442 --> 00:45:05,729
Today, I'll be evaluating your date performance.

619
00:45:05,937 --> 00:45:09,193
If you were Nita, you probably wouldn’t ride with me on the companion saddle.

620
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,868
This is me, not Nita.

621
00:45:14,222 --> 00:45:17,739
I would never let someone I love face danger alone.
