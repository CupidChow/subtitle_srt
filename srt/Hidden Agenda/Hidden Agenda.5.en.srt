1
00:00:00,123 --> 00:00:03,080
Why did you want to come with me on this rugged trip?

2
00:00:03,182 --> 00:00:07,405
how could anyone leave you sad and alone when you're in this state?

3
00:00:07,714 --> 00:00:10,743
You bring a warm and comforting vibe with you.

4
00:00:11,446 --> 00:00:16,266
Once I got to know you, you’ve always been kind to me, you know that?

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,611
You should let yourself express your feelings sometimes.

6
00:00:22,237 --> 00:00:26,048
If your heart races whenever you’re around someone,

7
00:00:27,393 --> 00:00:29,270
does that mean you have feelings for that person?

8
00:00:45,203 --> 00:00:46,297
Zo, what are you doing?

9
00:00:49,964 --> 00:00:50,781
Zo!

10
00:00:52,942 --> 00:00:53,556
Zo!

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,734
Zo!

12
00:00:57,308 --> 00:00:58,401
What's with the shouting?

13
00:00:58,771 --> 00:01:00,542
Keep it down, will you? You don't want to disturb everyone.

14
00:01:00,891 --> 00:01:02,891
I asked you a question, but you didn't answer me.

15
00:01:07,095 --> 00:01:08,247
Why were you yelling out my name?

16
00:01:09,317 --> 00:01:11,667
I just wanted to know what you’re doing, and you didn't answer.

17
00:01:44,681 --> 00:01:46,840
The bus broke down!

18
00:01:48,136 --> 00:01:50,303
Please do something. I’m in a hurry.

19
00:01:51,006 --> 00:01:53,459
Well, if you're in such a rush, come help me push it.

20
00:01:55,553 --> 00:01:58,356
Do we have any other options? Let's go.

21
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:05,701
We'll work together to give it a push.

22
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,558
Come on!

23
00:02:15,506 --> 00:02:16,480
Excuse me.

24
00:02:18,685 --> 00:02:20,109
Ready?

25
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,833
Let’s go.

26
00:02:22,001 --> 00:02:26,121
One, two, three!

27
00:02:30,155 --> 00:02:31,192
Start the engine! Now!
[Chiang Khan - Pak Chom]

28
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:33,594
Start the engine! Now!

29
00:02:35,182 --> 00:02:36,235
Start the engine! Now!

00:02:36,235 --> 00:02:37,297
[ Tha Li ]
[ Chiang Khan ]

31
00:02:44,667 --> 00:02:45,625
We can go home now.

32
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:46,832
We did it!

33
00:02:49,129 --> 00:02:49,856
Get on the bus.

34
00:02:50,865 --> 00:02:51,726
What's up with you?

35
00:03:53,821 --> 00:03:54,416
Zo.

36
00:03:56,006 --> 00:03:56,648
Zo.

37
00:03:56,957 --> 00:03:57,576
Zo.

38
00:03:58,748 --> 00:03:59,375
Zo!

39
00:04:01,433 --> 00:04:02,065
We’re here.

40
00:04:11,473 --> 00:04:12,453
Shall I call a cab?

41
00:04:13,473 --> 00:04:15,110
My place or yours?

42
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,194
I think we should split here.

43
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:22,867
Why?

44
00:04:23,397 --> 00:04:24,553
I'll get a taxi for me.

45
00:04:28,757 --> 00:04:29,455
Zo,

46
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:34,277
aren't we going to talk about last night?

47
00:04:40,753 --> 00:04:41,469
I'm exhausted.

48
00:04:43,136 --> 00:04:44,420
I'll just call a taxi from here.

49
00:04:48,098 --> 00:04:48,889
I'm sorry.

50
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,617
But I think we should keep things the same between us.

51
00:04:55,252 --> 00:04:59,228
What happened last night never happened, okay?

52
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:37,764
Zo!

53
00:05:38,443 --> 00:05:39,416
What are you doing here?

54
00:05:39,888 --> 00:05:41,662
I'm in Bangkok for a business seminar.

55
00:05:41,782 --> 00:05:42,897
I’ve just arrived.

56
00:05:43,103 --> 00:05:45,799
Why didn't you tell me that you were coming?

57
00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:49,521
I've asked you to call me before you arrive.

58
00:05:49,906 --> 00:05:52,320
It was last-minute business, sweetheart.

59
00:05:52,516 --> 00:05:56,800
But come on, I'll only be here for a few days. Please?

60
00:06:00,562 --> 00:06:01,497
Let me tidy up your apartment.

61
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:03,777
There’s really no need, Mom.

62
00:06:04,554 --> 00:06:05,902
This place is covered in dust.

63
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,361
How could I not?

64
00:06:13,365 --> 00:06:13,984
Hey!

65
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,640
Zo,

66
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:22,349
Zo!

67
00:06:22,925 --> 00:06:24,925
How was your trip to Chiang Khan?

68
00:06:25,071 --> 00:06:27,483
How’s Uncle Art? Is he well?

69
00:06:29,068 --> 00:06:33,520
He’s good. He sends his regards to you and Dad, by the way.

70
00:06:34,474 --> 00:06:37,400
We haven't seen him for so long. I do miss him.

71
00:06:39,683 --> 00:06:41,271
Did you go there alone?

72
00:06:50,023 --> 00:06:53,920
Mom, I brought back lots of snacks. They’re over there.

73
00:06:54,632 --> 00:06:55,574
Feel free to have some.

74
00:06:58,208 --> 00:06:58,998
Here.

75
00:07:13,385 --> 00:07:14,665
That last class was packed.

76
00:07:15,104 --> 00:07:15,984
With lessons?

77
00:07:16,087 --> 00:07:17,084
With me napping!

78
00:07:17,674 --> 00:07:20,909
And I saw you dozing off too, so don’t even think about lecturing me.

79
00:07:21,404 --> 00:07:23,404
But I think we should eat now. That might wake us up.

80
00:07:23,404 --> 00:07:24,851
Yeah, I'm starving.

81
00:07:24,851 --> 00:07:25,351
True.

82
00:07:40,301 --> 00:07:40,998
Guys,

83
00:07:42,398 --> 00:07:44,792
I've got to go.

84
00:07:45,133 --> 00:07:46,012
Where are you going?

85
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,043
My mom… she’s in town. I have to go see her.

86
00:07:51,701 --> 00:07:53,166
Your mom?

87
00:07:55,592 --> 00:07:56,572
I’ll catch up with you later.

88
00:07:56,881 --> 00:08:01,040
Zo, aren't you going to go to that class in the afternoon?

89
00:08:01,243 --> 00:08:04,848
I heard they’re taking attendance.

90
00:08:10,939 --> 00:08:16,499
Alright, I'll meet you there. But I really have to go now.

91
00:08:16,499 --> 00:08:17,388
Your bag!

92
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:21,223
Oh right, I need that. See you.

93
00:08:23,431 --> 00:08:24,101
I'll be right back.

94
00:08:24,842 --> 00:08:25,459
Hey,

95
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,005
what’s the hurry?

96
00:08:29,312 --> 00:08:29,896
Zo!

97
00:08:32,283 --> 00:08:32,933
Zo!

98
00:08:33,921 --> 00:08:35,901
You said you wanted to keep our relationship the same.

99
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:40,960
But what you're doing is anything but that.

100
00:08:42,357 --> 00:08:43,563
What are you talking about?

101
00:08:44,201 --> 00:08:46,600
Here I am, doing the same things as always.

102
00:08:47,245 --> 00:08:48,772
No, you're not. Nothing feels the same.

103
00:08:52,623 --> 00:08:56,120
Why are you shouting at me? I've got to get to class.

104
00:09:00,148 --> 00:09:00,774
Zo!

105
00:09:00,856 --> 00:09:01,606
Let go!

106
00:09:02,985 --> 00:09:03,609
Zo!

107
00:09:11,004 --> 00:09:13,724
I’m sorry. Let me…

108
00:09:16,035 --> 00:09:16,744
No need.

109
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:20,608
Never mind.

110
00:09:22,124 --> 00:09:22,706
I really have to go now.

111
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:24,266
Wait!

112
00:09:40,353 --> 00:09:42,863
Zo, you’re back!

113
00:09:43,451 --> 00:09:44,990
Why are you back so early today?

114
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,773
What happened to your jacket?

115
00:09:54,503 --> 00:09:56,730
I spilled something on it.

116
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,486
That's quite a spill.

117
00:09:59,947 --> 00:10:01,510
The stain is huge!

118
00:10:01,989 --> 00:10:03,333
So, what are you in the mood to eat today?

119
00:10:04,524 --> 00:10:05,850
Roselle juice.

120
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:06,497
Hmm?

121
00:10:07,419 --> 00:10:07,991
Oh….

122
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:10,318
whatever, Mom.

123
00:10:10,417 --> 00:10:11,688
Whatever?

124
00:10:11,972 --> 00:10:16,376
Why don’t you do me a favor by saying what you want to eat other than…

125
00:10:16,376 --> 00:10:18,467
Everything you make is delicious, Mom.

126
00:10:24,304 --> 00:10:29,315
"Whatever, Mom." Now, what am I supposed to cook?

127
00:10:30,349 --> 00:10:31,960
This kid…

128
00:10:33,728 --> 00:10:34,951
Whatever.

129
00:10:50,332 --> 00:10:52,332
[Joke: Zo, you’re avoiding me on purpose, aren’t you?]

130
00:10:52,779 --> 00:10:54,779
[Joke: I’ll come over to your dorm.]

131
00:10:57,443 --> 00:11:02,066
I just realized I forgot to buy tamarind juice. I'll go grab some.

132
00:11:02,066 --> 00:11:04,245
No need, Mom. I'll go get it for you.

133
00:11:08,857 --> 00:11:14,136
[Joke: You have my snacks.]

134
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,790
[Zo: Don’t come over.]

135
00:11:27,325 --> 00:11:29,325
[Zo: I’ll bring them to campus.]

136
00:11:47,411 --> 00:11:49,411
[Joke is calling.]

137
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,227
Zo…

138
00:12:26,578 --> 00:12:29,131
And who might you be? A friend of Zo's?

139
00:12:29,788 --> 00:12:30,570
Yes, I am.

140
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:32,419
My name is Joke.

141
00:12:32,872 --> 00:12:34,032
And you’re…

142
00:12:34,032 --> 00:12:35,455
His mom.

143
00:12:35,874 --> 00:12:38,700
Zo isn’t here right now. He just stepped out to get some tamarind juice.

144
00:12:38,837 --> 00:12:40,400
He'll be back shortly.

145
00:12:41,024 --> 00:12:43,024
I guess I’ll be going…

146
00:12:46,149 --> 00:12:47,207
Do you smell something burning?

147
00:12:51,238 --> 00:12:53,419
Sweet pork! My sweet pork!

148
00:12:54,135 --> 00:12:56,232
It's burning! What am I going to do?

149
00:12:56,232 --> 00:12:57,338
Oh, my!

150
00:12:58,430 --> 00:12:59,529
Can I help with anything?

151
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,450
Can you turn this off? I don't know how.

152
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:03,429
No, wait, that’s increasing the heat!

153
00:13:08,631 --> 00:13:09,744
Should I put water on it?

154
00:13:09,744 --> 00:13:13,375
No! That’ll fill this room with smoke.

155
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,413
Just put it down.

156
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:23,410
(You’ll smell it.)

157
00:13:23,564 --> 00:13:24,736
I’m back, Mom!

158
00:13:24,736 --> 00:13:25,637
(Isn’t that wonderful aroma?)

159
00:13:26,414 --> 00:13:27,465
(It smells amazing.)

160
00:13:27,465 --> 00:13:28,088
(Have a taste.)

161
00:13:28,088 --> 00:13:30,083
Mom, I’m starving.

162
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:31,302
(Welll, how is it?)

163
00:13:31,788 --> 00:13:32,819
(Perfect.)

164
00:13:33,578 --> 00:13:34,591
(So well balanced.)

165
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,457
(Not too spicy, I hope?)

166
00:13:35,671 --> 00:13:36,514
(Not at all.)

167
00:13:36,514 --> 00:13:37,671
(Delicious, isn’t it?)

168
00:13:39,237 --> 00:13:40,216
There you are, Zo!

169
00:13:40,896 --> 00:13:42,490
Where is my tamarind juice?

170
00:13:48,847 --> 00:13:50,003
What's going on, Mom?

171
00:13:50,489 --> 00:13:54,090
Why are you here? I said I’d bring the snacks to campus.

172
00:13:54,691 --> 00:13:55,742
I needed them quickly.

173
00:13:58,583 --> 00:14:03,730
Well, I'll get them for you, so you can leave.

174
00:14:04,133 --> 00:14:05,404
Zo.

175
00:14:06,481 --> 00:14:09,490
Your friend is already here. Why not invite him to stay for dinner?

176
00:14:10,789 --> 00:14:12,449
Join us for dinner, Joke.

177
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,915
I'd be delighted.

178
00:14:20,509 --> 00:14:21,660
The sour curry is yummy.

179
00:14:29,823 --> 00:14:31,240
Try the soup, sweetheart.

180
00:14:32,522 --> 00:14:34,911
Joke said it smelled nice, and he loved it.

181
00:14:38,487 --> 00:14:40,633
I’m a big fan of southern cuisine.

182
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:44,170
The stir-fried stink bean and prawn dish is my favorite.

183
00:14:44,412 --> 00:14:45,557
Really?

184
00:14:45,873 --> 00:14:48,646
Too bad I didn’t make that today.

185
00:14:48,646 --> 00:14:51,803
Zo never likes stink beans.

186
00:14:51,803 --> 00:14:54,116
He can’t stand the smell.

187
00:14:54,116 --> 00:14:56,699
He can eat other southern dishes.

188
00:14:56,922 --> 00:15:00,130
But when he smells stink beans, his face turns sour like this.

189
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:03,370
“It stinks so bad! I’m going to puke!” He even tears up!

190
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:06,240
Mom, stop teasing me.

191
00:15:16,273 --> 00:15:17,194
Are you alright there?

192
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:39,610
Joke, is it too hot?

193
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:43,491
Why didn’t you tell me? I would’ve made it milder.

194
00:15:44,701 --> 00:15:45,745
Just a bit spicy.

195
00:15:45,939 --> 00:15:50,050
But it’s so delicious that a little heat won’t stop me.

196
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,516
If it’s too hot, take it slow.

197
00:15:53,014 --> 00:15:55,354
Try these dishes. They aren’t spicy.

198
00:15:59,273 --> 00:15:59,992
How’s that?

199
00:16:02,906 --> 00:16:06,831
How did you two become such good friends?

200
00:16:08,312 --> 00:16:10,300
Zo, you never told me anything.

201
00:16:10,689 --> 00:16:13,010
What about Kot and Pat? Are you still close with them?

202
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,434
Mom, you get right to the point!

203
00:16:17,028 --> 00:16:20,690
Joke and I are in the same club.

204
00:16:21,976 --> 00:16:25,250
I’m still close with Kot and Pat, as always.

205
00:16:25,413 --> 00:16:30,376
I'm glad you're making new friends, Zo.

206
00:16:30,453 --> 00:16:32,720
Bring them home sometime.

207
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:43,981
How's the club? You never talk about it.

208
00:16:44,445 --> 00:16:48,582
Did you do something bad and you’re afraid to tell me?

209
00:16:48,582 --> 00:16:51,253
Mom! Why would you even say that?

210
00:16:51,253 --> 00:16:52,999
You look guilty right now.

211
00:16:52,999 --> 00:16:55,106
Did you do something bad? Tell me.

212
00:16:55,106 --> 00:16:56,907
No, I’ve never done anything bad.

213
00:16:56,907 --> 00:16:58,447
In fact, Zo is very talented.

214
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:04,130
He's the star of the club. He works hard.

215
00:17:04,366 --> 00:17:09,210
He’s got many admirers, openly and secretly, all over campus.

216
00:17:11,695 --> 00:17:12,597
Really?

217
00:17:14,831 --> 00:17:16,828
That’s wonderful to hear.

218
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,643
Yes, Mom.

219
00:17:43,367 --> 00:17:45,130
Why'd you praise me so much to my mom?

220
00:17:49,961 --> 00:17:54,487
Now she'll expect even more from me.

221
00:17:54,956 --> 00:17:56,665
I didn’t think that far.

222
00:17:58,451 --> 00:18:01,277
And I wasn't exaggerating.

223
00:18:03,371 --> 00:18:05,130
I genuinely think you're exceptional.

224
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:12,791
Give it to me.

225
00:18:13,956 --> 00:18:14,816
Zo.

226
00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:44,164
Kids.

227
00:18:45,233 --> 00:18:46,730
I’ve got desserts.

228
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:48,652
Let’s have some after you finish doing the dishes.

229
00:18:49,873 --> 00:18:50,850
Yes, Mom.

230
00:19:13,025 --> 00:19:16,312
Say thanks to your mom for me. Her cooking was amazing.

231
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:20,482
Sure.

232
00:19:22,279 --> 00:19:23,025
Here’s your stuff.

233
00:19:24,701 --> 00:19:25,735
Go home.

234
00:19:30,884 --> 00:19:31,715
Zo,

235
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:38,572
I know you've been avoiding me, even though you said you weren’t.

236
00:19:44,384 --> 00:19:45,530
Back in Chiang Khan,

237
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:49,170
when you kissed me,

238
00:19:53,652 --> 00:19:54,826
tell me how you felt.

239
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,223
Joke,

240
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:11,247
I’m sorry.

241
00:20:12,268 --> 00:20:12,893
But

242
00:20:13,694 --> 00:20:15,506
I don't want to talk about what happened.

243
00:20:16,607 --> 00:20:18,051
Why would you do that to me

244
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:21,425
and then tell me to forget?

245
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:25,630
Did you ever think how that would make me feel?

246
00:20:29,543 --> 00:20:31,256
You kissed me, Zo!

247
00:20:32,446 --> 00:20:33,559
How could I ever forget that?

248
00:20:35,308 --> 00:20:36,413
I did.

249
00:20:37,627 --> 00:20:41,849
I thought about how you would feel, so I didn’t dare say anything.

250
00:20:42,029 --> 00:20:46,457
Shutting me out like this doesn't make me feel better.

251
00:20:47,976 --> 00:20:49,806
You never care about my feelings, Zo.

252
00:20:50,539 --> 00:20:53,656
If you did, you’d tell me how you felt.

253
00:21:06,404 --> 00:21:07,690
I’m so sorry, Joke.

254
00:21:08,196 --> 00:21:11,313
I’ve got lots of things on my mind.

255
00:21:11,978 --> 00:21:14,013
I don’t know how to feel about you.

256
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,650
And there’s this whole thing with Nita.

257
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:23,789
I don’t want to say things that I might regret later.

258
00:21:26,736 --> 00:21:28,299
Can you give me a bit of time to figure it out?

259
00:21:32,179 --> 00:21:35,539
I know you’re dealing with a lot.

260
00:21:39,342 --> 00:21:40,465
I’m not trying to push you,

261
00:21:42,611 --> 00:21:43,658
but I hope you know

262
00:21:45,457 --> 00:21:47,748
you can’t keep running away from your feelings.

263
00:21:52,042 --> 00:21:53,799
Take all the time you need.

264
00:21:55,697 --> 00:21:57,240
But don't run away from me.

265
00:21:58,673 --> 00:21:59,808
Don't avoid me.

266
00:22:03,014 --> 00:22:05,250
I don't want things to get even more awkward between us.

267
00:22:15,526 --> 00:22:16,557
I’m sorry.

268
00:22:19,374 --> 00:22:21,096
I will try not to shut you out.

269
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,846
Go home.

270
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,753

Jeng,

282
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:48,882
hand me the song list.

283
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,561
Ready to sing another song, huh?

284
00:23:53,737 --> 00:23:55,263
We're here at the karaoke bar! We’re supposed to sing.

285
00:24:09,995 --> 00:24:10,763
Hello.

286
00:24:10,763 --> 00:24:12,972
(Hello, where are you?)

287
00:24:13,154 --> 00:24:15,154
I'm at a karaoke bar.

288
00:24:15,467 --> 00:24:17,467
(I want some noodles from that place.)

289
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,298
I'm still with Joke right now.

290
00:24:23,298 --> 00:24:25,633
No worries… I’ll order delivery.

291
00:24:25,633 --> 00:24:29,335
Hold on, I’m leaving now. Be right there.

292
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:40,258
So you're just going to ditch me the moment your boyfriend calls?

293
00:24:40,719 --> 00:24:44,218
You'll understand when you have someone special.

294
00:24:52,493 --> 00:24:53,822
You two seem so happy.

295
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:56,474
Like you can talk about anything.

296
00:24:58,138 --> 00:25:04,770
Getting to this point wasn't easy. We fought and adjusted.

297
00:25:06,787 --> 00:25:08,618
Every couple has problems, you know.

298
00:25:11,377 --> 00:25:18,120
But with your situation, even if he's not clear with you,

299
00:25:19,459 --> 00:25:21,682
you can be clear with him.

300
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:31,071
Knowing how you feel might help him make a decision.

301
00:25:40,642 --> 00:25:43,507
Give it a try.

302
00:25:47,098 --> 00:25:48,428
I can't believe I'm giving you advice.

303
00:25:49,328 --> 00:25:50,261
Anyway, I'm off.

304
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:53,197
Whose is this?

305
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:55,011
See you later.

306
00:25:57,634 --> 00:25:58,655
I won’t forget this.

307
00:26:01,473 --> 00:26:03,461
Wait till I'm in a relationship!

308
00:26:17,414 --> 00:26:18,220
Zo!

309
00:26:19,615 --> 00:26:21,479
I've been looking for you.

310
00:26:23,243 --> 00:26:24,071
What’s up?

311
00:26:24,258 --> 00:26:28,081
I need to get you to the club. The seniors are at the club for training.

312
00:26:28,292 --> 00:26:31,659
We need to set up the room and get the slides ready.

313
00:26:32,713 --> 00:26:33,421
Did you forget?

314
00:26:33,421 --> 00:26:35,578
Prepare the room and slides?

315
00:26:35,578 --> 00:26:36,078
Yep.

316
00:26:38,298 --> 00:26:43,925
Oh no, I completely forgot!

317
00:26:44,957 --> 00:26:45,742
Shit!

318
00:26:49,019 --> 00:26:50,025
What’s wrong?

319
00:26:50,248 --> 00:26:54,538
Pok, we’re in big trouble. I left my laptop at my dorm.

320
00:26:54,857 --> 00:26:55,936
You forgot your laptop?

321
00:26:56,679 --> 00:26:57,840
What do we do?

322
00:26:58,538 --> 00:27:01,553
If I go back to my dorm, will I make it back in time?

323
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:03,648
Will you? Your dorm is quite far.

324
00:27:05,151 --> 00:27:06,078
What now?

325
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:10,265
Is it in the apartment?

326
00:27:11,258 --> 00:27:12,312
I can grab it.

327
00:27:12,703 --> 00:27:14,143
I drive fast, so I won’t be long.

328
00:27:15,497 --> 00:27:16,805
But don't you have football practice?

329
00:27:17,251 --> 00:27:19,778
I do, but I can be a bit late.

330
00:27:19,913 --> 00:27:21,913
You guys wait at the club.

331
00:27:22,188 --> 00:27:23,393
I'll be back in a flash.

332
00:27:26,602 --> 00:27:27,622
Thank you so much.

333
00:27:28,654 --> 00:27:30,058
You are the nicest person, Jeng.

334
00:27:30,876 --> 00:27:33,797
I’m only nice to you.

335
00:27:35,161 --> 00:27:35,923
See you.

336
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:37,498
Thank you so much.

337
00:27:37,798 --> 00:27:39,854
No problem. I'll be back with the laptop soon.

338
00:27:39,854 --> 00:27:41,098
You guys head to the club.

339
00:27:51,918 --> 00:27:54,098
Let's go, Zo.

340
00:27:55,872 --> 00:27:56,816
Pok,

341
00:27:58,406 --> 00:27:59,739
I've got a question for you.

342
00:28:00,632 --> 00:28:01,698
Ask away.

343
00:28:03,487 --> 00:28:09,218
When did you realize that you were into Jeng?

344
00:28:10,699 --> 00:28:16,270
And, how did you know that he would be the one for you?

345
00:28:26,145 --> 00:28:29,298
I wasn't sure at first,

346
00:28:29,766 --> 00:28:33,133
but I felt some sort of gravitational pull between us.

347
00:28:34,647 --> 00:28:38,321
It’s like the Earth kept throwing me his way.

348
00:28:39,925 --> 00:28:45,217
No matter where I went, whom I met, I kept seeing his face.

349
00:28:48,361 --> 00:28:52,338
Whenever we were close, I just couldn’t seem to take my eyes off him.

350
00:29:00,431 --> 00:29:01,390
Really?

351
00:29:03,538 --> 00:29:06,420
I know it sounds cheesy, but it’s true.

352
00:29:08,786 --> 00:29:15,027
Then, I realized I should just let things happen naturally, and here we are.

353
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,840
So, why do you ask? Or…

354
00:29:24,202 --> 00:29:26,202
Got some love trouble?

355
00:29:28,069 --> 00:29:29,998
Love trouble?

356
00:29:31,449 --> 00:29:32,787
No, not t all.

357
00:29:33,401 --> 00:29:37,631
I just… Just curious for a friend.

358
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,616
Don’t read too much into it.

359
00:29:43,298 --> 00:29:45,717
When it comes to love, don’t overthink.

360
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:47,823
Let your heart lead the way.

361
00:29:47,823 --> 00:29:53,011
The one for you will be there when you need them the most.

362
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:01,585
Ready to go?

363
00:30:02,506 --> 00:30:04,348
Alright, let’s go.

364
00:30:13,075 --> 00:30:15,187
Luckily, the seniors aren’t here yet.

365
00:30:18,598 --> 00:30:20,068
Hello, Nita.

366
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:20,937
Hi.

367
00:30:21,133 --> 00:30:23,133
Grab a seat. I’ll hook up the system.

368
00:30:23,281 --> 00:30:25,281
Oh, impressive!

369
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:26,243
I’ve got this covered.

370
00:30:52,904 --> 00:30:54,318
What's on the agenda today?

371
00:30:56,795 --> 00:30:59,098
We've got training with the seniors.

372
00:30:59,907 --> 00:31:01,086
Didn't you see the group chat?

373
00:31:03,123 --> 00:31:04,338
You never told me.

374
00:31:06,193 --> 00:31:09,218
You never read the group chat.

375
00:31:13,817 --> 00:31:15,817
Look, the seniors are here.

376
00:31:15,817 --> 00:31:16,732
All set.

377
00:31:25,866 --> 00:31:27,866
Hello.

378
00:31:28,836 --> 00:31:30,218
Is everyone present? Let's begin.

379
00:31:30,998 --> 00:31:36,578
We have training today with the seniors who won the competition.

380
00:31:36,578 --> 00:31:39,040
Pay attention, please.

381
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,378
Hello, I'm Praew.

382
00:31:41,378 --> 00:31:43,852
I'll be leading today.

383
00:31:43,852 --> 00:31:52,118
First, please stand, introduce yourself, and strike a pose.

384
00:31:53,195 --> 00:31:55,195
Ready?

385
00:31:56,508 --> 00:31:57,597
Pok, you go.

386
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,317
You’re older; you go.

387
00:32:01,807 --> 00:32:04,030
I’m Nita from International Relations.

388
00:32:16,973 --> 00:32:18,638
I’m Pok from International Relations.

389
00:32:24,535 --> 00:32:25,285
Please, go on.

390
00:32:25,285 --> 00:32:27,456
Joke, no.

391
00:32:30,146 --> 00:32:31,421
The pressure…

392
00:32:34,552 --> 00:32:37,417
Hello, I’m Zo from RI.

393
00:32:37,417 --> 00:32:38,626
It’s IR.

394
00:32:49,187 --> 00:32:52,219
Hello, I’m Joke from Public Administration.

395
00:32:55,872 --> 00:32:57,872
The seniors aren't under the table.

396
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:11,501
What is that pose? Please explain.

397
00:33:11,999 --> 00:33:14,698
This is the Teletubbies’ sun.

398
00:33:14,815 --> 00:33:16,178
So you like Teletubbies?

399
00:33:17,372 --> 00:33:21,604
Someone here told me that the sun makes people happy.

400
00:33:22,364 --> 00:33:23,918
So I just wanted to spread the joy.

401
00:33:33,289 --> 00:33:37,856
How’s that? Cool, huh? Took me a while to come up with that.

402
00:33:38,983 --> 00:33:44,387
I wanted you to smile. Stop looking so grumpy. It doesn't suit you.

403
00:33:51,756 --> 00:33:55,988
Alright, now that we know everyone, it’s time to pair up.

404
00:33:55,988 --> 00:34:00,737
You will practice pronunciation in pairs.

405
00:34:00,737 --> 00:34:03,768
Exercises will be handed out.

406
00:34:07,733 --> 00:34:11,574
A tree toad loved a she-toad

407
00:34:12,018 --> 00:34:14,241
Who lived up in a tree

408
00:34:14,241 --> 00:34:15,852
Ugh!

409
00:34:15,852 --> 00:34:17,313
Easy, Joke.

410
00:34:20,116 --> 00:34:23,879
He was a two-toed tree toad

411
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:26,599
But a three-toed toad was she…

412
00:34:28,548 --> 00:34:29,451
I can't’!

413
00:34:30,372 --> 00:34:31,469
A tree toad…

414
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:32,647
Keep it down

415
00:34:34,098 --> 00:34:35,164
Do it slowly.

416
00:34:37,051 --> 00:34:41,534
A tree toad loved a she-toad

417
00:34:41,534 --> 00:34:42,459
Need help?

418
00:34:44,797 --> 00:34:45,940
That’s fine, Nita.

419
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:47,467
I’ll work with him.

420
00:34:51,398 --> 00:34:53,398
What’s up?

421
00:34:54,681 --> 00:34:56,058
I can’t get it right.

422
00:34:56,285 --> 00:34:57,107
Which part?

423
00:34:58,948 --> 00:35:01,242
The seniors are here to help.

424
00:35:01,671 --> 00:35:02,726
Why don’t you ask them?

425
00:35:04,846 --> 00:35:06,433
They’re over there.

426
00:35:07,673 --> 00:35:12,324
And you joined the club before I did. That means you’re my senior.

427
00:35:13,882 --> 00:35:17,058
Please, Zo. Please help me.

428
00:35:17,058 --> 00:35:20,352
Please, please. Help me out here.

429
00:35:20,721 --> 00:35:22,721
Please, Zo, please.

430
00:35:22,721 --> 00:35:26,701
Please, Zo, please help me.

431
00:35:33,503 --> 00:35:34,315
Alright.

432
00:35:39,086 --> 00:35:46,217
A tree toad loved a tee shoad…

433
00:35:46,217 --> 00:35:47,484
A she toad

434
00:35:47,523 --> 00:35:52,285
Who lived up in a tree

435
00:35:52,738 --> 00:35:53,347
That’s better.

436
00:35:53,347 --> 00:35:53,929
Great!

437
00:35:53,929 --> 00:35:56,251
He was a two-toed tree toad

438
00:35:56,251 --> 00:35:57,922
But a three-toed toad was she

439
00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:01,496
How was that? Did you get it right?

440
00:36:02,441 --> 00:36:08,698
Now, here are some pictures from past competitions.

441
00:36:09,608 --> 00:36:13,778
This one was from last year.

442
00:36:15,357 --> 00:36:17,664
Pok, great shot!

443
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:37,396
Why are you looking at me?

444
00:36:40,169 --> 00:36:43,759
Look at the beautiful slides the senior prepared.

445
00:36:45,601 --> 00:36:46,481
I’m looking.

446
00:36:49,578 --> 00:36:52,938
Where? You’re only looking at my face.

447
00:36:54,544 --> 00:36:56,544
I’m looking at the slides.

448
00:37:10,958 --> 00:37:12,280
A tree toad loved a she-toad

449
00:37:13,842 --> 00:37:15,636
Who lived up in a tree

450
00:37:17,269 --> 00:37:18,514
He was a two-toed tree toad

451
00:37:19,574 --> 00:37:20,698
But a three-toed toad was she

452
00:37:27,204 --> 00:37:28,364
I want to love the toad.

453
00:37:30,485 --> 00:37:31,995
Does the toad love me?

454
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,697
The toad doesn’t have to love me.

455
00:37:36,255 --> 00:37:38,255
All I ask is that the toad talk to me like before.

456
00:37:51,835 --> 00:37:53,098
Any questions?

457
00:37:56,849 --> 00:37:59,602
Were you stressed out during the competition?

458
00:37:59,602 --> 00:38:03,044
Very much so, and very nervous.

459
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,698
Why did the tree toad love the she-toad?

460
00:38:11,542 --> 00:38:14,798
What do you think were our team’s strengths?

461
00:38:14,798 --> 00:38:19,373
During my competition, our team was punctual and disciplined.

462
00:38:19,373 --> 00:38:24,108
Those are crucial for winning.

463
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:25,656
Any questions?

464
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:27,925
More questions?

465
00:38:28,092 --> 00:38:29,756
Okay, let’s turn on the lights.

466
00:38:31,528 --> 00:38:35,927
I hope you guys go back and practice what you’ve learned today.

467
00:38:35,927 --> 00:38:39,885
In the upcoming NOVA, the award for best speaker awaits you.

468
00:38:39,885 --> 00:38:43,099
Whoever wins this award will receive a scholarship to study in Finland.

469
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:49,266
I’ll see those of you who can join an off-campus activity tomorrow.

470
00:38:49,547 --> 00:38:51,938
Don’t be late. Alright, let’s go home.

471
00:38:53,441 --> 00:38:54,898
Finland!

472
00:38:54,898 --> 00:38:56,799
That would be so fulfilling!

473
00:38:58,908 --> 00:39:00,978
We need to win that award.

474
00:39:01,933 --> 00:39:03,176
Pok in Finland.

475
00:39:04,069 --> 00:39:05,458
Zo in Finland.

476
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,098
Where are you off to?

477
00:39:12,102 --> 00:39:13,008
Want to grab a bite?

478
00:39:16,539 --> 00:39:19,618
No, I’m just going to head back to my place.

479
00:39:19,618 --> 00:39:21,815
Oh, man.

480
00:39:22,149 --> 00:39:23,613
Enough.

481
00:39:25,566 --> 00:39:27,206
I'm not trying to avoid you.

482
00:39:27,457 --> 00:39:31,487
My mom is leaving today, so I need to see her off.

483
00:39:33,206 --> 00:39:35,206
So you're going to the airport, aren't you?

484
00:39:36,568 --> 00:39:37,403
I'll give you a ride.

485
00:39:38,568 --> 00:39:43,081
No need. My mom’s taking a taxi to the airport.

486
00:39:43,445 --> 00:39:46,178
I just need to help her pack.

487
00:39:47,368 --> 00:39:48,838
I should go.

488
00:39:51,427 --> 00:39:52,616
Catch you later.

489
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:54,264
See you tomorrow.

490
00:39:58,886 --> 00:39:59,858
Take it easy.

491
00:40:06,777 --> 00:40:11,404
Does the toad love me?

492
00:40:19,171 --> 00:40:21,171
[Debate Combat]

493
00:40:28,299 --> 00:40:31,150
Wave, you made it!

494
00:40:32,327 --> 00:40:34,741
Hi there.

495
00:40:34,741 --> 00:40:37,847
Guys, this lady is a crew member here. She will oversee the show.

496
00:40:37,989 --> 00:40:41,323
Why don't you grab a seat? Wave, go, and sit here.

497
00:40:41,323 --> 00:40:41,932
Alright.

498
00:40:41,932 --> 00:40:43,484
Everyone, grab a seat.

499
00:40:44,051 --> 00:40:47,477
Please make yourselves comfortable. Don't be tense.

500
00:40:47,518 --> 00:40:49,334
Let me do a briefing now.

501
00:40:49,334 --> 00:40:49,962
Okay.

502
00:40:49,962 --> 00:40:51,756
Hurry up. You’re blocking the way!

503
00:41:03,705 --> 00:41:07,062
Attention, everyone, we're starting the shoot soon.

504
00:41:07,062 --> 00:41:09,800
Silence on set, okay?

505
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,850
Okay!

506
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:12,517
I can’t hear you! Okay?

507
00:41:12,517 --> 00:41:13,584
Okay!

508
00:41:13,584 --> 00:41:15,005
Alright.

509
00:41:19,118 --> 00:41:20,302
Are you still excited?

510
00:41:21,797 --> 00:41:25,258
Absolutely, this is the first time I watched anything like this.

511
00:41:25,752 --> 00:41:27,269
Are the hosts ready?

512
00:41:27,269 --> 00:41:27,769
Ready.

513
00:41:27,769 --> 00:41:28,853
Camera ready?

514
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:29,353
Ready.

515
00:41:30,345 --> 00:41:33,725
Five, four, three, two, one, action!

516
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:42,422
Hello, welcome to Debate Combat,

517
00:41:42,422 --> 00:41:46,638
a fun debate show with a playful tone

518
00:41:46,638 --> 00:41:49,878
and great weakly takeaways.

519
00:41:50,173 --> 00:41:52,771
Today's episode is quite special.

520
00:41:52,771 --> 00:41:58,496
We have special guests today, students from a prestigious university's debate club,

521
00:41:58,496 --> 00:42:00,583
right here in the studio!

522
00:42:00,583 --> 00:42:04,239
If you’re excited, make some noise.

523
00:42:10,041 --> 00:42:14,548
Let's get the show started.

524
00:42:14,548 --> 00:42:15,651
Let’s go!

525
00:42:17,019 --> 00:42:23,538
The debate topic for today is school uniforms: pro or con?

526
00:42:23,765 --> 00:42:25,581
That team's up first.

527
00:42:25,581 --> 00:42:26,350
Alright then.

528
00:42:26,654 --> 00:42:31,276
Do you know why you should wear school uniforms to campus?

529
00:42:31,276 --> 00:42:32,030
Why?

530
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:36,051
It reminds you of your role and focus.

531
00:42:36,051 --> 00:42:37,146
That’s it?

532
00:42:37,146 --> 00:42:38,601
For now. Just warming up.

533
00:42:39,776 --> 00:42:42,305
Our team that’s all about casual dressing says…

534
00:42:42,305 --> 00:42:43,833
Oh, we got some laughs.

535
00:42:43,833 --> 00:42:44,733
That’s great.

536
00:42:44,733 --> 00:42:46,624
Hit us.

537
00:42:46,624 --> 00:42:51,338
Clothing has nothing to do with your ideas or your role.

538
00:42:51,338 --> 00:42:53,184
Well, I disagree.

539
00:43:01,323 --> 00:43:02,748
Well, I disagree.

540
00:43:04,887 --> 00:43:06,381
Enough said.

541
00:43:06,381 --> 00:43:11,210
Alright, we’ve come to the end of the show.

542
00:43:11,329 --> 00:43:14,098
Before we find out the debate result,

543
00:43:14,098 --> 00:43:20,003
we have a fun game for the students here.

544
00:43:20,003 --> 00:43:22,974
Our game is easy. But before we talk about the rules,

545
00:43:23,103 --> 00:43:29,427
can I have five volunteers join us?

546
00:43:29,798 --> 00:43:33,017
Raise your hands.

547
00:43:33,017 --> 00:43:35,559
If you’re keen, please stand up.

548
00:43:35,559 --> 00:43:38,574
Come to the stage.

549
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:40,118
We need two more.

550
00:43:40,118 --> 00:43:42,494
- Anyone in the back?
- We’ll need two more. Come on.

551
00:43:42,757 --> 00:43:44,757
Two more volunteers needed.

552
00:43:44,757 --> 00:43:46,950
Join us for some fun!

553
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:51,161
Our game is easy. We need two more.

554
00:43:51,934 --> 00:43:52,978
Two here.

555
00:43:53,299 --> 00:43:55,299
Great!

556
00:43:58,624 --> 00:44:00,302
Come on up.

557
00:44:01,539 --> 00:44:05,264
We now have five volunteers.

558
00:44:05,264 --> 00:44:07,307
Our game is so simple.

559
00:44:07,707 --> 00:44:13,088
I want each of you to pick the side that you think has won the debate.

560
00:44:13,088 --> 00:44:17,744
Those who guess correctly will win a financial prize from our sponsor.

561
00:44:21,936 --> 00:44:26,418
Those who pick wrong will face a challenge.

562
00:44:26,681 --> 00:44:32,637
But before we get to that, let’s ask our volunteers to choose sides.

563
00:44:32,637 --> 00:44:34,299
Pick a side.

564
00:44:34,299 --> 00:44:35,784
Casual dress wins, obviously.

565
00:44:36,172 --> 00:44:39,000
Uniforms all the way.

566
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,024
Alright.

567
00:44:42,051 --> 00:44:44,051
It's time to hear the result.

568
00:44:44,051 --> 00:44:49,143
The winners are…

569
00:44:51,319 --> 00:44:52,978
the other team!

570
00:44:59,538 --> 00:45:01,538
I thought we had solid arguments!

571
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:03,298
I thought I was the best.

572
00:45:06,992 --> 00:45:09,705
The losing side will now face a challenge.

573
00:45:09,705 --> 00:45:10,930
What kind of challenge?

574
00:45:11,071 --> 00:45:14,980
The losing team will face the stink bean challenge!

575
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:16,840
Here they come!

576
00:45:21,628 --> 00:45:26,319
Each gets one bean.

577
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:29,030
I'm sorry we lost.

578
00:45:31,362 --> 00:45:33,362
I put my trust in you.

579
00:45:35,137 --> 00:45:37,137
How bad can it be?

580
00:45:37,804 --> 00:45:41,506
I'll show you how to eat it.

581
00:45:42,382 --> 00:45:48,706
Eat it! Eat it! Eat it!

582
00:45:49,503 --> 00:45:50,560
Eat up!.

583
00:45:55,616 --> 00:45:57,218
Do I really need to eat it?

584
00:45:57,218 --> 00:45:57,926
Yes.

585
00:45:58,675 --> 00:46:00,675
Eat it!

586
00:46:00,844 --> 00:46:04,270
Eat it! Eat it! Eat it!

587
00:46:04,558 --> 00:46:06,305
Eat it. It tastes sweet.

588
00:46:08,336 --> 00:46:09,474
Let me eat it instead.

589
00:46:10,532 --> 00:46:11,946
Why did you do that?

590
00:46:14,012 --> 00:46:16,038
Alright, then!

591
00:46:18,867 --> 00:46:21,992
Allow me to close the show.

592
00:46:21,992 --> 00:46:25,763
Big thanks to all of our sponsors!

593
00:46:25,763 --> 00:46:28,367
We’ll be back next week.

594
00:46:28,367 --> 00:46:31,694
That's it for today.

595
00:46:31,694 --> 00:46:32,620
Bye.

596
00:46:33,523 --> 00:46:38,674
Thank you, all. Thank you, guys, for joining us today.

597
00:46:38,674 --> 00:46:41,839
We have some snacks for you outside. Please grab some.

598
00:46:42,201 --> 00:46:45,466
We’re done here. You can go now. Thank you.

599
00:46:45,466 --> 00:46:47,230
Goodbye.

600
00:46:49,396 --> 00:46:52,776
Thank you for coming today to spice up our show.

601
00:47:04,375 --> 00:47:04,916
Hey!

602
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:11,091
We need to talk on campus.

603
00:47:12,143 --> 00:47:12,761
Me?

604
00:47:12,761 --> 00:47:13,407
Yes!

605
00:47:33,030 --> 00:47:34,501
Why did you eat that stink bean for me?

606
00:47:36,148 --> 00:47:36,819
Hmm?

607
00:47:41,625 --> 00:47:42,840
It's no big deal.

608
00:47:43,298 --> 00:47:44,171
What's up with you?

609
00:47:46,016 --> 00:47:48,568
I just don't want you to do things for me.

610
00:47:50,097 --> 00:47:51,227
It's totally fine.

611
00:47:52,097 --> 00:47:55,498
You don't like to eat it, so I eat it for you.

612
00:47:57,495 --> 00:47:58,874
You don’t get it, Joke.

613
00:48:00,635 --> 00:48:02,934
It's not about whether you can eat it for me.

614
00:48:04,065 --> 00:48:04,932
I just…

615
00:48:04,932 --> 00:48:05,881
Hold on, Zo.

616
00:48:06,795 --> 00:48:11,325
I don’t think this is about me eating the stink bean.

617
00:48:12,965 --> 00:48:14,065
What's really going on?

618
00:48:17,124 --> 00:48:20,416
Tell me what's on your mind.

619
00:48:24,344 --> 00:48:25,944
I felt bad about kissing you,

620
00:48:28,083 --> 00:48:29,275
avoiding you,

621
00:48:30,494 --> 00:48:32,709
and being the idiot that I’ve been.

622
00:48:35,193 --> 00:48:37,913
Despite all that, you still helped me.

623
00:48:41,773 --> 00:48:42,623
Why?

624
00:48:43,773 --> 00:48:44,445
Zo,

625
00:48:45,802 --> 00:48:46,509
you know what?

626
00:48:47,762 --> 00:48:48,771
If it weren’t you,

627
00:48:50,266 --> 00:48:51,441
I wouldn’t do that.

628
00:48:53,418 --> 00:48:57,074
Because it’s you, I would do anything for you.

629
00:49:01,227 --> 00:49:03,227
But it's different this time.

630
00:49:03,979 --> 00:49:05,979
My feelings are involved.

631
00:49:06,650 --> 00:49:08,811
I thought I was into Nita.

632
00:49:10,842 --> 00:49:14,268
But I couldn’t figure out why I kissed you.

633
00:49:17,049 --> 00:49:17,708
Yes,

634
00:49:19,801 --> 00:49:23,143
this time is different.

635
00:49:23,682 --> 00:49:24,495
How?

636
00:49:25,576 --> 00:49:26,778
Let’s be clear.

637
00:49:26,955 --> 00:49:28,794
I'm feeling like such an idiot.

638
00:49:29,083 --> 00:49:31,258
I’m so confused about my own feelings.

639
00:49:31,804 --> 00:49:35,690
I feel guilty about Nita and you.

640
00:49:39,275 --> 00:49:40,907
Is it because I like you?

641
00:50:03,099 --> 00:50:04,221
I like you, Zo.

642
00:50:07,050 --> 00:50:10,481
I’ll make you see that I really like you.

643
00:50:13,502 --> 00:50:17,273
I want to make you see that you like me too.

644
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:23,975
Let me win you over, Zo.

645
00:50:46,101 --> 00:50:47,618
Joke is trying to win me over.

646
00:50:47,727 --> 00:50:48,307
Huh?

647
00:50:48,813 --> 00:50:49,681
Morning.

648
00:50:49,855 --> 00:50:51,349
Isn't this a bit much?

649
00:50:51,569 --> 00:50:54,558
Just wait till you understand the meaning of this flower I got you.

650
00:50:54,650 --> 00:50:55,411
Zo!

651
00:50:55,987 --> 00:50:57,895
What if you get sick?

652
00:50:58,100 --> 00:50:59,295
How do you feel about all this?

653
00:50:59,906 --> 00:51:02,550
I'm still not sure, but maybe…

654
00:51:03,298 --> 00:51:06,954
Don't let the sunflower wait and wither away.

655
00:51:08,541 --> 00:51:09,424
So?

656
00:51:10,068 --> 00:51:11,185
Will you open up your heart?
