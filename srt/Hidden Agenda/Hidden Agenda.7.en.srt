1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,263
Joke is trying to win me over.

2
00:00:02,414 --> 00:00:04,863
How about you open up your heart to me?

3
00:00:04,863 --> 00:00:08,022
Before diving into something new, I feel like I need to close the previous chapter.

4
00:00:08,022 --> 00:00:11,134
How do you feel about me now?

5
00:00:15,071 --> 00:00:17,307
We've come too far for me to let you get away this time.

6
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:18,870
I’m serious about us.

7
00:00:19,512 --> 00:00:21,748
Did you know when you hug for 30 seconds,

8
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,424
the body will release oxytocin.

9
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:26,467
What happens if we hug longer?

10
00:00:27,477 --> 00:00:29,270
In that case, it means we feel the same.

11
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,453
Why did you choose this place for our date?

12
00:01:00,897 --> 00:01:02,543
Why, don't you like it?

13
00:01:04,201 --> 00:01:05,259
It's not that.

14
00:01:06,322 --> 00:01:12,640
You're the one who said, "Be yourself on the first date."

15
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:15,469
Just trying to play along.

16
00:01:16,825 --> 00:01:19,209
Well, you seemed to have a blast at the arcade.

17
00:01:19,635 --> 00:01:20,677
Thought you might like it here.

18
00:01:21,635 --> 00:01:24,000
Plus, I have some fond memories of this place.

19
00:01:26,038 --> 00:01:28,805
Who were you here with? Your ex?

20
00:01:29,267 --> 00:01:30,051
No.

21
00:01:30,317 --> 00:01:31,297
With whom then?

22
00:01:32,316 --> 00:01:33,200
I'm not telling you.

23
00:01:33,335 --> 00:01:36,945
Come on, man! Tell me who it was.

24
00:01:39,273 --> 00:01:40,087
Not saying.

25
00:01:41,273 --> 00:01:43,040
You’re impossible.

26
00:01:47,681 --> 00:01:48,594
What is this?

27
00:01:50,601 --> 00:01:52,249
The ticket guy handed them out.

28
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:54,959
It's a promotion.

29
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,119
Ride everything here and win headphones.

30
00:01:59,241 --> 00:02:00,195
Headphones?

31
00:02:00,195 --> 00:02:00,975
Yes.

32
00:02:00,975 --> 00:02:02,732
- The latest edition.
- The latest edition!

33
00:02:03,936 --> 00:02:05,401
I could use some new headphones.

34
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:07,880
You want them?

35
00:02:08,966 --> 00:02:10,520
Let me buy you a pair.

36
00:02:11,835 --> 00:02:13,481
That's not the point.

37
00:02:14,221 --> 00:02:17,549
Don't you want to try all the rides? Are you scared?

38
00:02:19,263 --> 00:02:23,152
It’s fine if you don’t want to. I can go solo.

39
00:02:24,148 --> 00:02:25,182
I'm not scared.

40
00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:27,889
But there are so many rides.

41
00:02:28,423 --> 00:02:29,390
I'm not sure about hitting them all.

42
00:02:30,405 --> 00:02:32,040
We've got all day.

43
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,360
If you're scared, just say it. No judgment.

44
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:46,139
I'm not scared. Nothing scares me.

45
00:02:47,512 --> 00:02:48,583
Nothing?

46
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,360
Okay, then.

47
00:02:52,482 --> 00:02:53,590
Follow me.

48
00:02:59,556 --> 00:03:00,488
Come on!

49
00:03:01,674 --> 00:03:02,742
Alright!

50
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:26,515
How was that?

51
00:03:29,762 --> 00:03:30,726
Great.

52
00:03:31,258 --> 00:03:33,789
Take it easy!

53
00:03:35,344 --> 00:03:37,934
Get it all out.

54
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:37,544
Are you okay, Joke?

55
00:04:39,433 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm fine. I’m great.

56
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:45,973
For you.

57
00:04:47,862 --> 00:04:48,940
Thanks.

58
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:03,017
Slow! Don't gulp it down so fast., or you might choke.

59
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:06,340
That was too fast.

60
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:16,931
What was that?

61
00:05:18,001 --> 00:05:22,215
I love that sound when opening a soda can. So satisfying.

62
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,537
Are you making fun of me?

63
00:05:45,753 --> 00:05:49,908
Joke, there are still a lot of rides to check out.

64
00:05:51,372 --> 00:05:54,560
Don’t chicken out now!

65
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,782
I'm no chicken.

66
00:05:57,496 --> 00:05:59,142
Pick any ride you want.

67
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,214
Okay, that one.

68
00:06:02,043 --> 00:06:04,581
Any ride but that red one, please?

69
00:06:06,234 --> 00:06:08,072
No, we’re doing them all.

70
00:06:09,017 --> 00:06:11,257
Fine. Bring it on.

71
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,083
Come on.

72
00:06:15,954 --> 00:06:16,766
Let’s go.

73
00:06:17,091 --> 00:06:17,886
Let’s go.

74
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,269
Hurry up!

75
00:06:21,933 --> 00:06:23,697
Zo, how about a picture?

76
00:06:23,697 --> 00:06:24,430
Sure.

77
00:06:25,172 --> 00:06:27,467
Smile! Three, two…

78
00:06:28,878 --> 00:06:30,288
Now, hands up.

79
00:06:30,288 --> 00:06:31,266
One, two, three.

80
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,990
Try to look out.

81
00:06:58,779 --> 00:06:59,596
Hey!

82
00:06:59,596 --> 00:07:00,096
What?

83
00:07:00,096 --> 00:07:00,985
Just sit.

84
00:07:00,985 --> 00:07:03,778
Why? You can stand. It's safe.

85
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:05,602
Just have a seat for now.

86
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,599
Zo.

87
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:40,089
Ever been here with anyone else?

88
00:07:42,316 --> 00:07:43,962
Seriously? You’re asking me that?

89
00:07:44,834 --> 00:07:46,720
You still haven't shared who you were here with.

90
00:07:47,358 --> 00:07:48,856
Fine, I'll tell you.

91
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,588
I came here with my grandma

92
00:07:52,466 --> 00:07:54,000
during my high school years.

93
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,599
Your grandma?

94
00:07:58,813 --> 00:08:01,004
I had a great time.

95
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:04,356
My grandma pampered me.

96
00:08:04,527 --> 00:08:05,730
She’d treat me to any ride I wanted.

97
00:08:09,324 --> 00:08:11,087
That's why I wanted to share this place with you.

98
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:16,338
Spend good moments together and make good memories for ourselves.

99
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:19,575
What a cheesy line! Did it take you long to come up with that?

100
00:08:20,887 --> 00:08:22,061
I bet you liked it.

101
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:41,335
I've got some memories of this place as well.

102
00:08:44,685 --> 00:08:48,190
How are these memories?

103
00:08:52,428 --> 00:08:56,081
I was in Bangkok for a debate competition.

104
00:08:57,317 --> 00:09:00,498
I had this friend, Puen.

105
00:09:00,728 --> 00:09:02,728
It seemed like he was interested in me.

106
00:09:02,989 --> 00:09:06,199
And he took me here.

107
00:09:07,617 --> 00:09:08,579
Puen.

108
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:10,886
What’s up?

109
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,038
I think…

110
00:09:21,764 --> 00:09:23,080
I think I like you.

111
00:09:29,115 --> 00:09:30,237
What did you say, Zo?

112
00:09:33,071 --> 00:09:34,510
I said I like you.

113
00:09:38,013 --> 00:09:39,629
Why did you have to tell me that now?

114
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:41,943
Why?

115
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:45,207
Are you not ready?

116
00:09:45,903 --> 00:09:47,903
I think you've got the wrong idea.

117
00:09:50,941 --> 00:09:52,469
What are you saying?

118
00:09:53,882 --> 00:09:55,646
I don't get you at all.

119
00:09:57,217 --> 00:09:58,053
Zo,

120
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,164
listen carefully.

121
00:10:02,354 --> 00:10:04,118
I don’t feel the same way about you.

122
00:10:08,453 --> 00:10:12,755
So, what you've done all this time is meaningless?

123
00:10:13,969 --> 00:10:17,200
You should be able to tell that I have feelings for you.

124
00:10:17,691 --> 00:10:18,467
That’s true.

125
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,507
But put yourself in the shoes of the person who has to say no to you.

126
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,216
It’s not like that, Puen.

127
00:10:28,508 --> 00:10:30,508
You came into my life.

128
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:34,256
You were acting like you were into me.

129
00:10:36,699 --> 00:10:40,913
And now you're saying it's all in my head?

130
00:10:43,721 --> 00:10:44,531
That's right.

131
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,614
My feelings mean nothing to you?

132
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:55,913
I just thought it’d be fun.

133
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,252
Zo!

134
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,187
Are you crying?

135
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,342
No, don’t you cry.

136
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:20,043
This is no big deal.

137
00:11:23,824 --> 00:11:25,204
Don’t cry.

138
00:11:26,141 --> 00:11:27,280
Hey,

139
00:11:28,697 --> 00:11:30,000
are you seriously crying?

140
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:32,764
You’re cruel!

141
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,656
I never understood why he did that to me.

142
00:11:44,712 --> 00:11:51,759
And the worse? Someone I thought was my best friend actually duped me.

143
00:11:53,403 --> 00:11:55,078
He was shipping me and Puen,

144
00:11:56,606 --> 00:11:58,488
telling me to confess my feelings to Puen.

145
00:11:59,763 --> 00:12:04,538
When everything fell apart, he was laughing at me, mocking me.

146
00:12:08,123 --> 00:12:09,474
I was such an idiot.

147
00:12:12,654 --> 00:12:14,093
You were not an idiot, Zo.

148
00:12:15,149 --> 00:12:16,441
Not at all.

149
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:21,161
Anyone in your shoes would feel horrible.

150
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:31,332
Maybe that’s why I’m afraid to confess my feelings to anyone.

151
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:43,192
I get it, Zo.

152
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:49,741
You can talk to me about anything that upsets you, okay?

153
00:12:52,448 --> 00:12:54,182
I’ll be your perfect listener.

154
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,821
I’m sorry for bringing you here.

155
00:13:18,511 --> 00:13:19,510
That’s fine.

156
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,724
You don’t need to apologize.

157
00:13:23,616 --> 00:13:25,970
I hadn’t shared this with you before.

158
00:13:27,143 --> 00:13:31,799
I should thank you for bringing me here.

159
00:13:34,293 --> 00:13:35,100
Why?

160
00:13:37,048 --> 00:13:39,008
I brought you to the place that brought up bad feelings for you.

161
00:13:42,001 --> 00:13:48,000
No, you changed this place into fond memories for us.

162
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:11,753
Hey,

163
00:14:13,065 --> 00:14:14,640
we’ve still got one ride left.

164
00:14:15,783 --> 00:14:17,281
The haunted house.

165
00:14:18,173 --> 00:14:19,937
Can we skip that?

166
00:14:20,107 --> 00:14:21,042
You're not up for it?

167
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,200
I can do this alone if you don't want to.

168
00:14:24,838 --> 00:14:26,838
Fine, I’m coming with you.

169
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:30,799
You know I could buy this for you, right?

170
00:14:32,625 --> 00:14:33,332
Come on.

171
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,508
We should get moving. Follow me.

172
00:14:47,388 --> 00:14:48,443
What was that?

173
00:14:50,134 --> 00:14:52,370
They were fixing the door.

174
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:54,308
They were. They didn’t want a cat to come in.

175
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,180
Just relax.

176
00:15:08,319 --> 00:15:09,522
Zo!

177
00:15:25,527 --> 00:15:29,080
I’ve never seen so much blood and gore in my life.

178
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,001
Calm down.

179
00:15:31,161 --> 00:15:32,659
How come you were not scared?

180
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:36,508
I was, but you were hilarious.

181
00:15:36,884 --> 00:15:39,200
If it's too much for you, don't try it.

182
00:15:40,999 --> 00:15:42,000
I don't like this.

183
00:15:42,999 --> 00:15:45,002
I don't like you seeing me this way.

184
00:15:45,422 --> 00:15:46,464
There goes my cool image.

185
00:15:47,422 --> 00:15:52,720
But I really like it when you scream so loud.

186
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:54,846
Scream so loud?

187
00:15:55,348 --> 00:15:57,160
Now you're just laughing at me.

188
00:15:57,432 --> 00:15:58,724
You're just like my grandma.

189
00:16:00,131 --> 00:16:03,840
There, there, Joke. It’s okay. Don’t be scared.

190
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:09,190
Don’t be tense or scared.

191
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:10,066
You jerk!

192
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:14,979
Yes!

193
00:16:15,481 --> 00:16:20,078
Finally, the headphones are mine.

194
00:16:22,294 --> 00:16:23,006
Ours.

195
00:16:24,452 --> 00:16:25,976
Come on, picture time.

196
00:16:26,162 --> 00:16:27,104
Put them on.

197
00:16:32,243 --> 00:16:33,301
A selfie?

198
00:16:33,944 --> 00:16:35,166
Yeah, a selfie.

199
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:39,920
Smile! Like this.

200
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,084
Smile. Yes!

201
00:16:42,718 --> 00:16:44,836
One, two, three!

202
00:16:45,168 --> 00:16:48,480
Now, let’s try a boomerang.

203
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,026
Do this.

204
00:16:50,277 --> 00:16:52,720
Muah, muah.

205
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,897
Pucker up.

206
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,072
Like this.

207
00:16:55,072 --> 00:16:56,398
Okay, let’s do it.

208
00:16:56,537 --> 00:16:58,537
Three, two, one.

209
00:16:58,638 --> 00:17:00,009
Muah, muah.

210
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:10,128
Shit!

211
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:18,950
Damn it!

212
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:26,153
Do you want to play?

213
00:17:26,655 --> 00:17:27,962
No, you go ahead.

214
00:17:28,081 --> 00:17:29,130
Don't you want to play together?

215
00:17:29,809 --> 00:17:31,114
It’s fun watching you.

216
00:17:31,114 --> 00:17:32,085
One game?

217
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:33,269
No, you play.

218
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:42,985
Hey, are you all right?

219
00:17:43,139 --> 00:17:44,419
It's our day off, and we're chilling at home.

220
00:17:45,629 --> 00:17:48,000
It's fine. I'm used to it.

221
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,110
Did I mess up or something?

222
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:53,379
Something bugging you?

223
00:17:58,143 --> 00:18:00,763
Chill. I'm fine.

224
00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:04,648
Pok, you know,

225
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:07,320
you always say this when you are in a sour mood.

226
00:18:08,029 --> 00:18:10,354
I know that you’re actually upset with me.

227
00:18:20,546 --> 00:18:25,734
I’m asking because I care about you.

228
00:18:30,475 --> 00:18:33,095
What’s up with you? Are you sulking?

229
00:18:34,976 --> 00:18:38,599
Are you?

230
00:18:38,801 --> 00:18:40,565
Believe me now?

231
00:18:40,565 --> 00:18:44,535
I believe you!

232
00:18:46,135 --> 00:18:47,230
What was that?

233
00:18:48,529 --> 00:18:49,611
Do you believe me now?

234
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,779
Yes.

235
00:18:52,284 --> 00:18:53,817
I told you, I get it.

236
00:18:56,888 --> 00:18:58,327
That’s good to hear.

237
00:18:59,701 --> 00:19:00,640
Thank you.

238
00:19:02,352 --> 00:19:03,717
And I'm sorry,

239
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:06,592
okay?

240
00:19:45,209 --> 00:19:45,923
Grandma!

241
00:19:46,568 --> 00:19:47,223
Grandma!

242
00:19:47,223 --> 00:19:49,562
Joke! Is that you?

243
00:19:49,562 --> 00:19:53,129
I miss you. It’s been a long time.

244
00:19:54,172 --> 00:19:57,023
It hasn't been that long. I just saw you the other day.

245
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,506
Well,

246
00:20:02,231 --> 00:20:03,848
I want to see you more…

247
00:20:03,848 --> 00:20:05,237
Good evening.

248
00:20:10,689 --> 00:20:11,501
Grandma,

249
00:20:12,026 --> 00:20:14,626
this is Zo. Remember I mentioned him?

250
00:20:15,841 --> 00:20:19,720
Ah, the one I made that chrysanthemum tea for.

251
00:20:20,036 --> 00:20:21,024
Yes, that’s me.

252
00:20:21,383 --> 00:20:23,280
It’s so delicious. I loved it.

253
00:20:28,801 --> 00:20:32,952
Oh, I brought these for you.

254
00:20:33,951 --> 00:20:38,102
Joke said they’re your favorites.

255
00:20:38,931 --> 00:20:39,659
Here they are.

256
00:20:43,019 --> 00:20:44,150
Try one, Grandma.

257
00:21:02,702 --> 00:21:04,342
Oh, no!

258
00:21:06,022 --> 00:21:06,810
It's not delicious?

259
00:21:07,424 --> 00:21:11,640
The crust is too hard, quite oily, and stale.

260
00:21:11,774 --> 00:21:12,674
I’m sorry.

261
00:21:12,674 --> 00:21:15,051
I didn’t realize…

262
00:21:15,051 --> 00:21:19,214
That’s fine. This is not important.

263
00:21:19,721 --> 00:21:22,371
I need to go to bed now.

264
00:21:22,706 --> 00:21:24,258
Have the temple to go to early in the morning.

265
00:21:24,504 --> 00:21:25,389
See you, Joke.

266
00:21:55,005 --> 00:21:55,751
Grandma!

267
00:21:59,515 --> 00:22:01,150
You cannot talk to Zo this way.

268
00:22:03,147 --> 00:22:04,296
Why is he wearing your shirt?

269
00:22:05,035 --> 00:22:06,088
Did you spend the night together?

270
00:22:09,949 --> 00:22:16,699
You didn't mention he was a guy, just that you’re bringing over a friend.

271
00:22:17,908 --> 00:22:19,832
But I could tell that he’s not just a friend.

272
00:22:21,032 --> 00:22:26,595
Do you think I’m too old to understand what’s going on?

273
00:22:27,928 --> 00:22:30,174
Grandma, it’s not like that.

274
00:22:30,712 --> 00:22:31,757
- I just…
- Enough.

275
00:22:33,639 --> 00:22:34,594
I'm going to bed.

276
00:23:05,115 --> 00:23:06,756
You said your grandma would love me.

277
00:23:11,665 --> 00:23:12,803
Give her time.

278
00:23:15,469 --> 00:23:17,070
I've never brought anyone home before.

279
00:23:18,058 --> 00:23:19,241
She just didn't know what to do.

280
00:23:20,921 --> 00:23:22,276
You've never brought anyone here?

281
00:23:22,951 --> 00:23:25,825
Not even Park or Nita?

282
00:23:26,541 --> 00:23:27,444
Neither has been here?

283
00:23:29,393 --> 00:23:30,871
I don’t usually bring friends around to see Grandma.

284
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:37,509
You’re the only one I wanted her to meet.

285
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:46,996
Alright,

286
00:23:47,623 --> 00:23:50,308
I’ll come over tomorrow for round two.

287
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:56,595
I'm not backing down that easy.

288
00:24:06,942 --> 00:24:09,994
Alright, we start with two eggs.

289
00:24:10,344 --> 00:24:11,017
Two eggs.

290
00:24:11,017 --> 00:24:11,784
Let’s do this.

291
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:14,720
Crack the eggs.

292
00:24:23,477 --> 00:24:24,381
Let me give it a sniff.

293
00:24:26,913 --> 00:24:28,009
Good, good.

294
00:24:28,756 --> 00:24:30,487
Stop.

295
00:24:31,821 --> 00:24:33,462
Okay, I think it’s good.

296
00:24:34,044 --> 00:24:35,516
Don’t eat it yet!

297
00:24:36,166 --> 00:24:37,277
You can't eat it yet.

298
00:25:03,515 --> 00:25:04,935
You whip this up for me?

299
00:25:05,515 --> 00:25:06,229
Yes, ma’am.

300
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:10,147
I'll give it a try.

301
00:25:24,797 --> 00:25:25,972
I think…

302
00:25:26,331 --> 00:25:27,694
It tastes…

303
00:25:34,305 --> 00:25:35,051
Delicious!

304
00:25:36,261 --> 00:25:39,720
Great aroma, a soft crust—a little bit too thick though.

305
00:25:40,375 --> 00:25:45,131
But I commend your effort.

306
00:25:46,183 --> 00:25:49,057
Why the hard time with Zo earlier?

307
00:25:49,918 --> 00:25:54,720
If he backed out because of this, you guys wouldn’t last.

308
00:25:56,089 --> 00:25:56,766
Joke,

309
00:25:58,178 --> 00:26:01,696
your partner must be a fighter.

310
00:26:02,118 --> 00:26:07,255
It wouldn’t last otherwise.

311
00:26:12,115 --> 00:26:17,790
Grandma, we’re not dating.

312
00:26:26,861 --> 00:26:28,040
See?

313
00:26:28,757 --> 00:26:30,138
We are just friends.

314
00:26:31,059 --> 00:26:33,776
And I never thought you’d be this conservative.

315
00:26:34,408 --> 00:26:38,066
Didn’t you say when I was in high school I could be with anyone I wanted?

316
00:26:44,355 --> 00:26:46,720
You need to step up your game, Joke.

317
00:26:48,221 --> 00:26:50,221
because I’m kind of fond of this one.

318
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:57,472
I heard you like my chrysanthemum tea.

319
00:26:58,124 --> 00:27:01,200
Yes, thank you so much, ma’am.

320
00:27:09,239 --> 00:27:12,584
Hey, be careful!

321
00:27:14,028 --> 00:27:15,105
This isn’t good.

322
00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:27,834
Give me a hand.

323
00:27:27,902 --> 00:27:30,334
One, two, three, yes!

324
00:27:34,256 --> 00:27:35,123
What's going on with you?

325
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:40,710
What are you going to do?

326
00:27:41,388 --> 00:27:42,560
Want me to call a mechanic?

327
00:27:42,919 --> 00:27:44,598
No, I got it.

328
00:27:45,945 --> 00:27:47,239
I think it’s just a leaky tire.

329
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,785
You know how to fix it?

330
00:28:04,086 --> 00:28:05,260
Why are you taking off your shirt?

331
00:28:06,335 --> 00:28:08,237
I don’t want grease all over my shirt while I'm working.

332
00:28:09,492 --> 00:28:10,194
Hold this.

333
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:21,567
I never knew you could fix a motorcycle.

334
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:28,418
I bought this bike with my own savings.

335
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:32,642
When you love something so much,

336
00:28:35,091 --> 00:28:36,421
you know how to take care of it.

337
00:28:41,373 --> 00:28:43,074
You sound like a life coach yet again.

338
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:48,700
The mosquitoes are eating you alive.

339
00:28:52,532 --> 00:28:53,378
My blood must be sweet.

340
00:28:55,192 --> 00:28:56,118
Almost done?

341
00:28:57,717 --> 00:28:58,545
Yes.

342
00:29:07,084 --> 00:29:07,650
Let’s go.

343
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,540
Seriously?

344
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:13,227
Are you dropping me off looking like that?

345
00:29:14,129 --> 00:29:15,502
You're covered in grease.

346
00:29:17,681 --> 00:29:18,972
Just wait for me here.

347
00:29:19,375 --> 00:29:20,151
I'll be right back.

348
00:29:30,988 --> 00:29:31,714
What's this for?

349
00:29:32,988 --> 00:29:34,150
Cleaning duty.

350
00:29:34,344 --> 00:29:35,379
You can't just go like this.

351
00:29:36,344 --> 00:29:37,287
Give me your hands.

352
00:29:39,481 --> 00:29:40,754
You want me to scrub down right here?

353
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:43,229
Yes. How're you going to put that shirt back on?

354
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:44,923
You don't want your shirt to get dirty.

355
00:29:46,267 --> 00:29:47,172
Give me your hands.

356
00:29:53,307 --> 00:29:54,456
You’ve got smudges everywhere.

357
00:30:00,621 --> 00:30:01,810
Right there.

358
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:04,951
More water, please.

359
00:30:06,748 --> 00:30:07,374
That’ll do.

360
00:30:07,531 --> 00:30:08,255
Here.

361
00:30:16,544 --> 00:30:19,866
Scrub harder. You won’t get the grease off.

362
00:30:21,438 --> 00:30:24,245
You don’t know how to scrub. Let me.

363
00:30:26,175 --> 00:30:27,626
Like this. See?

364
00:30:29,419 --> 00:30:30,659
It’s coming off.

365
00:30:34,534 --> 00:30:35,322
Zo.

366
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:38,672
Why are your cheeks red?

367
00:30:41,338 --> 00:30:42,286
What?

368
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:44,859
I’m not blushing. It’s nothing.

369
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,341
You are blushing.

370
00:30:46,341 --> 00:30:47,264
Are you messing with me?

371
00:30:47,857 --> 00:30:48,669
Are you?

372
00:30:48,781 --> 00:30:50,462
I can’t drive back if I’m all wet.

373
00:31:01,845 --> 00:31:02,755
Here you go.

374
00:31:02,921 --> 00:31:04,405
Let’s see.

375
00:31:24,517 --> 00:31:25,259
Approved!

376
00:31:26,483 --> 00:31:28,301
Go ahead with this topic.

377
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:30,385
Thank you.

378
00:31:30,385 --> 00:31:33,412
Let me ask you a question.

379
00:31:34,329 --> 00:31:40,244
Did you choose me as your advisor because I also advise the debate club?

380
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:42,205
That’s right.

381
00:31:42,537 --> 00:31:45,884
No one knows me better than you do.

382
00:31:47,484 --> 00:31:53,644
So, this will you leave you time to practice for the NOVA competition at the beginning of your senior year, right?

383
00:31:53,748 --> 00:31:54,596
Yes.

384
00:31:56,642 --> 00:31:59,244
I have no issues.

385
00:32:00,005 --> 00:32:03,499
Nita is on a similar path.

386
00:32:09,478 --> 00:32:15,793
Oh, is Nita doing the research this semester too?

387
00:32:16,338 --> 00:32:21,326
Yes. She came to talk about her research topic this morning.

388
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:23,870
Nita is working hard.

389
00:32:24,508 --> 00:32:29,164
She’s really gunning for the grand prize, the scholarship to Finland.

390
00:32:32,634 --> 00:32:37,248
I’m cheering for you both.

391
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:40,782
Thank you.

392
00:32:46,343 --> 00:32:48,136
See you later, Zo.

393
00:32:48,859 --> 00:32:49,977
Of course, ma’am.

394
00:32:50,662 --> 00:32:51,917
Oh, and Zo,

395
00:32:52,937 --> 00:32:57,724
Ms. Nok’s “Leadership and Personality Development” has been canceled, hasn’t it?

396
00:32:58,210 --> 00:32:59,421
Yeah, unfortunately.

397
00:33:01,392 --> 00:33:06,165
How about joining my class instead of dropping it?

398
00:33:07,497 --> 00:33:08,636
That’s great.

399
00:33:09,092 --> 00:33:13,646
I was just thinking about what to do.

400
00:33:14,502 --> 00:33:17,975
Is it the same time slot?

401
00:33:18,085 --> 00:33:23,405
Same time, but I’m over in the Slope building in Humanities.

402
00:33:24,891 --> 00:33:26,476
Not a problem.

403
00:33:27,452 --> 00:33:28,425
Thank you again.

404
00:33:28,985 --> 00:33:30,012
See you later.

405
00:33:30,012 --> 00:33:31,669
See you in class.

406
00:33:31,669 --> 00:33:32,462
Definitely.

407
00:33:56,627 --> 00:33:57,833
Shit!

408
00:33:58,850 --> 00:33:59,768
Let me help.

409
00:34:05,464 --> 00:34:06,685
Let me help.

410
00:34:14,569 --> 00:34:15,452
I’m good.

411
00:34:16,032 --> 00:34:17,596
These are manageable.

412
00:34:20,036 --> 00:34:21,891
Don't you have a quiz tomorrow?

413
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:26,106
Congratulations on getting your topic approved!

414
00:34:31,649 --> 00:34:32,519
Thank you,

415
00:34:33,868 --> 00:34:37,197
but you should head out and hit the books.

416
00:34:52,501 --> 00:34:53,133
Joke,

417
00:34:54,212 --> 00:34:55,082
what are you doing?

418
00:34:57,618 --> 00:34:58,332
Recharging.

419
00:35:03,289 --> 00:35:06,753
You should go home and study for the quiz tomorrow.

420
00:35:08,251 --> 00:35:09,467
What’s bugging you?

421
00:35:12,351 --> 00:35:13,135
Nothing.

422
00:35:15,683 --> 00:35:17,683
It's been a while since I've hugged anyone,

423
00:35:20,932 --> 00:35:22,061
other than my grandma.

424
00:35:31,109 --> 00:35:32,121
I have no energy.

425
00:35:33,823 --> 00:35:34,977
My battery is very low.

426
00:35:39,105 --> 00:35:40,566
Want a fast charge?

427
00:35:44,218 --> 00:35:44,746
Sure.

428
00:35:44,746 --> 00:35:45,409
Yeah?

429
00:37:12,932 --> 00:37:13,492
Zo!

430
00:37:18,575 --> 00:37:19,240
Zo!

431
00:37:39,644 --> 00:37:41,477
Hey, Zo!

432
00:37:43,091 --> 00:37:43,798
Zo!

433
00:37:45,333 --> 00:37:46,211
Are you alright?

434
00:37:50,107 --> 00:37:50,661
Zo!

435
00:37:50,661 --> 00:37:51,161
Hey, you!

436
00:37:52,053 --> 00:37:53,933
What's with the shouting?

437
00:37:54,788 --> 00:37:56,177
People live here, you know.

438
00:37:56,613 --> 00:37:57,971
This is my apartment building.

439
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:01,721
If you keep this up, I'll call the police.

440
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:04,703
Do you have a spare key to this apartment?

441
00:38:04,956 --> 00:38:06,023
My boy…

442
00:38:07,828 --> 00:38:09,508
My friend Zo is inside.

443
00:38:09,508 --> 00:38:10,866
I don’t know why he hasn’t answered the door.

444
00:38:10,866 --> 00:38:11,628
I’ve been knocking on it for some time.

445
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:14,855
Please.

446
00:38:15,332 --> 00:38:16,946
You may have seen me because I’m here often.

447
00:38:17,999 --> 00:38:18,939
I am his friend.

448
00:38:20,205 --> 00:38:22,199
The liabilities could be huge for you if something happened to him.

449
00:38:23,631 --> 00:38:25,361
Haven't you seen the news?

450
00:38:25,361 --> 00:38:26,410
Fine.

451
00:38:27,033 --> 00:38:28,618
He may have passed out in there.

452
00:38:32,637 --> 00:38:33,522
Come on, hurry.

453
00:38:33,522 --> 00:38:34,637
I'm going as quickly as I can.

454
00:38:39,096 --> 00:38:40,209
Zo!

455
00:38:42,076 --> 00:38:42,724
Zo!

456
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:43,772
Zo!

457
00:38:44,296 --> 00:38:45,943
Zo! Zo! Zo!

458
00:38:46,293 --> 00:38:47,167
Are you okay?

459
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:47,919
Zo!

460
00:38:49,482 --> 00:38:50,590
Are you okay?

461
00:38:53,985 --> 00:38:54,995
What’s all the fuss about?

462
00:38:56,302 --> 00:38:57,354
I’m fine.

463
00:39:03,326 --> 00:39:04,745
Oh, hello there.

464
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:11,958
I’m so sorry.

465
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:14,228
My friend is alright.

466
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:15,954
I’m so sorry for bothering you.

467
00:39:17,614 --> 00:39:18,287
Yeah, right.

468
00:39:25,167 --> 00:39:26,545
Why was she cranky?

469
00:39:28,797 --> 00:39:30,818
Did you get her to open my door?

470
00:39:33,565 --> 00:39:34,495
Not exactly.

471
00:39:38,115 --> 00:39:40,409
I knocked, but you didn't hear me.

472
00:39:40,952 --> 00:39:42,299
I shouted your name, but you didn't answer.

473
00:39:42,548 --> 00:39:43,595
I called you on the phone, but you didn't pick up.

474
00:39:44,932 --> 00:39:45,944
I was scared that something might happen.

475
00:39:48,849 --> 00:39:49,837
Well, I'm sorry.

476
00:39:50,417 --> 00:39:53,869
I wasn't aware of any of the things you said.

477
00:39:55,962 --> 00:39:59,497
I didn't even know when I fell asleep.

478
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:04,617
That's okay. It happens.

479
00:40:10,359 --> 00:40:11,319
I brought you Hainanese chicken rice.

480
00:40:12,982 --> 00:40:13,682
Enjoy.

481
00:40:21,608 --> 00:40:22,555
Are you okay?

482
00:40:25,866 --> 00:40:26,535
Zo!

483
00:40:27,724 --> 00:40:28,542
Zo!

484
00:40:30,617 --> 00:40:31,420
Zo!

485
00:40:31,893 --> 00:40:32,876
Are you alright?

486
00:40:44,907 --> 00:40:46,907
Please wait here for a moment.

487
00:40:50,054 --> 00:40:50,833
Joke.

488
00:40:51,726 --> 00:40:52,790
Are you alright?

489
00:40:54,165 --> 00:40:55,297
What did the doctor say?

490
00:40:56,686 --> 00:40:57,961
Nothing serious.

491
00:40:58,448 --> 00:41:04,526
Just an anxious stomach and lack of sleep.

492
00:41:05,502 --> 00:41:06,692
Don't you worry about me.

493
00:41:07,928 --> 00:41:09,521
How can I not worry about you?

494
00:41:11,145 --> 00:41:12,094
You are stubborn.

495
00:41:15,921 --> 00:41:16,907
I'm sorry.

496
00:41:18,124 --> 00:41:20,139
I didn’t think it’d get this bad.

497
00:41:21,159 --> 00:41:24,187
I promise, no more pushing myself too hard.

498
00:41:26,954 --> 00:41:27,964
Do you mean it?

499
00:41:29,913 --> 00:41:31,715
I understand that schoolwork is very important.

500
00:41:32,919 --> 00:41:35,163
But your health is the most important thing.

501
00:41:36,072 --> 00:41:40,400
And, you need to be in top shape for the debate competition, okay?

502
00:41:42,366 --> 00:41:46,748
Rest well, no push back.

503
00:41:47,506 --> 00:41:48,378
Got it.

504
00:41:51,098 --> 00:41:52,088
Let’s move.

505
00:42:09,204 --> 00:42:12,043
Are you feeling better now that you have taken the meds?

506
00:42:12,541 --> 00:42:13,583
A lot better,

507
00:42:15,315 --> 00:42:16,787
but still beat.

508
00:42:28,088 --> 00:42:28,931
Joke,

509
00:42:30,771 --> 00:42:33,768
taking care of me must be exhausting for you.

510
00:42:37,116 --> 00:42:38,305
Honestly,

511
00:42:39,523 --> 00:42:41,848
the only part that's tiring is when you’re being stubborn.

512
00:42:43,353 --> 00:42:44,571
Why, are you feeling guilty?

513
00:42:49,713 --> 00:42:51,199
Can you take a day off tomorrow?

514
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:57,236
The doctor wanted you to rest for a day and find something relaxing to do.

515
00:43:00,414 --> 00:43:02,712
Sounds like a plan.

516
00:44:00,216 --> 00:44:01,167
What would you like to order?

517
00:44:02,683 --> 00:44:03,949
A latte.

518
00:44:04,751 --> 00:44:05,474
What do you want, Zo?

519
00:44:07,314 --> 00:44:08,320
A chrysanthemum smootie?

520
00:44:09,954 --> 00:44:11,954
If only such a drink existed!

521
00:44:13,858 --> 00:44:14,848
I'll stick with my regular.

522
00:44:14,848 --> 00:44:15,858
Hot green tea?

523
00:44:15,858 --> 00:44:17,263
Matcha smoothie!

524
00:44:22,229 --> 00:44:23,848
Cash or QR code?

525
00:44:24,324 --> 00:44:25,116
QR code.

526
00:44:34,534 --> 00:44:36,968
Did you make the payment? I haven’t received the payment notification yet.

527
00:44:37,266 --> 00:44:38,169
I made the transfer.

528
00:44:39,116 --> 00:44:40,360
Oh, received it now.

529
00:44:43,824 --> 00:44:47,088
Please step aside for the next customer.

530
00:44:54,363 --> 00:44:55,186
What would you like to order?

531
00:44:57,189 --> 00:44:57,945
Umm…

532
00:44:59,379 --> 00:45:03,073
A caramel macchiato.

533
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:04,416
Coming right up.

534
00:45:05,086 --> 00:45:07,394
Caramel macchiato.

535
00:45:14,127 --> 00:45:15,426
Cash or QR code?

536
00:45:16,806 --> 00:45:17,859
QR code.

537
00:45:19,771 --> 00:45:22,610
I'll wait outside.

538
00:45:25,001 --> 00:45:26,108
I'll be out with our drinks shortly.

539
00:45:41,637 --> 00:45:43,637
Here's your matcha.

540
00:45:52,302 --> 00:45:55,276
You know that caramel macchiato guy earlier?

541
00:46:01,525 --> 00:46:04,283
I noticed you have been avoiding him since we were inside.

542
00:46:05,799 --> 00:46:06,723
You know him?

543
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:17,483
He’s…

544
00:46:21,759 --> 00:46:23,105
He’s Puen.

545
00:46:25,708 --> 00:46:26,803
That jerk?

546
00:46:31,052 --> 00:46:32,255
Easy!

547
00:46:35,288 --> 00:46:36,936
It was ages ago.

548
00:46:37,397 --> 00:46:38,856
How can I take it easy?

549
00:46:39,792 --> 00:46:41,440
He was an asshole to you.

550
00:46:43,607 --> 00:46:44,957
I know.

551
00:46:46,594 --> 00:46:47,863
But don’t confront him.

552
00:46:49,131 --> 00:46:50,887
At least, let me flesh it out with him.

553
00:46:51,744 --> 00:46:54,312
You deserve to know why he did that to you.

554
00:46:55,170 --> 00:46:56,330
There's no need.

555
00:46:58,306 --> 00:47:00,932
Remember what you told me in Chiang Khan?

556
00:47:03,643 --> 00:47:05,995
You don't need to find a reason for everything.

557
00:47:08,510 --> 00:47:13,622
Even if I found out the reason for this, it wouldn't make me feel any better.

558
00:47:14,705 --> 00:47:15,533
Zo,

559
00:47:24,471 --> 00:47:27,337
it’s been a while since we last met. How have you been?

560
00:47:30,942 --> 00:47:31,799
What's up?

561
00:47:33,125 --> 00:47:34,403
Can you spare me a moment?

562
00:47:39,188 --> 00:47:40,593
I want to speak to you privately.

563
00:47:48,647 --> 00:47:49,767
Time's tight.

564
00:47:51,716 --> 00:47:53,976
If you have something to say, say it here.

565
00:48:03,923 --> 00:48:08,846
I apologize for my past actions.

566
00:48:09,562 --> 00:48:18,030
I wanted to apologize earlier, but you'd blocked me

567
00:48:22,544 --> 00:48:31,824
Honestly, I felt something for you too.

568
00:48:36,838 --> 00:48:38,513
Then why'd you play games with him?

569
00:48:38,513 --> 00:48:39,307
No!

570
00:48:41,553 --> 00:48:42,478
Let me do this.

571
00:48:51,685 --> 00:48:56,554
I know that what I did to you was unforgivable.

572
00:48:58,223 --> 00:49:04,368
But you know what it was like back then at our school.

573
00:49:06,628 --> 00:49:12,092
It’s different here and now, and there’s this pressure from my family.

574
00:49:15,021 --> 00:49:19,565
I wasn’t ready to follow my feelings.

575
00:49:20,046 --> 00:49:21,721
You could've been honest without being cruel.

576
00:49:25,659 --> 00:49:26,415
You're right.

577
00:49:27,498 --> 00:49:31,584
If our roles were reversed, I'd feel the same.

578
00:49:33,953 --> 00:49:38,605
I've lived with that guilt.

579
00:49:41,495 --> 00:49:43,116
I'm really sorry, Zo.

580
00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:50,085
I know that I can't fix anything now, but I…

581
00:49:50,085 --> 00:49:50,687
Enough.

582
00:49:52,803 --> 00:49:54,695
I forgave you a long time ago.

583
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,276
I forgave you for everything.

584
00:50:02,923 --> 00:50:05,951
Could you unblock me?

585
00:50:14,299 --> 00:50:14,961
Puen,

586
00:50:16,088 --> 00:50:21,865
forgiving and rebuilding friendship are two separate matters.

587
00:50:30,693 --> 00:50:31,703
I need to go.

588
00:50:32,867 --> 00:50:33,857
Take care.

589
00:50:42,375 --> 00:50:43,293
Okay.

590
00:50:47,732 --> 00:50:49,139
Is this okay?

591
00:50:50,937 --> 00:50:52,088
Jump on.

592
00:51:18,857 --> 00:51:20,207
Why are you staring at me like that?

593
00:51:21,482 --> 00:51:22,778
I can get shy too.

594
00:51:23,892 --> 00:51:24,685
Why?

595
00:51:26,282 --> 00:51:27,245
Just feel like looking at you.

596
00:51:28,777 --> 00:51:29,520
What's going on with you?

597
00:51:31,144 --> 00:51:33,240
Do I need to keep an eye on you tonight?

598
00:51:34,897 --> 00:51:36,626
Are you planning on any late-night funny business?

599
00:51:39,421 --> 00:51:40,907
Keep an eye on me?

600
00:51:43,192 --> 00:51:43,999
Yeah.

601
00:51:47,788 --> 00:51:49,414
No funny business.

602
00:51:50,314 --> 00:51:52,314
I'll need to get back to work.

603
00:51:54,956 --> 00:51:57,470
I should go.

604
00:52:03,493 --> 00:52:06,115
Zo, please.

605
00:52:09,911 --> 00:52:11,099
Not tonight.

606
00:52:13,634 --> 00:52:17,556
Please don’t. No work, okay?

607
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:21,004
I was pulling your leg!

608
00:52:21,732 --> 00:52:23,732
I won’t be doing any work.

609
00:52:24,448 --> 00:52:25,811
I'm going straight to bed.

610
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,070
I'm spent.

611
00:52:29,979 --> 00:52:30,846
Good boy.

612
00:52:37,531 --> 00:52:38,502
Thank you.

613
00:52:39,286 --> 00:52:41,936
Today taught me so much.

614
00:52:47,003 --> 00:52:50,031
Thank you for coming into my life.

615
00:52:54,311 --> 00:52:56,176
Thank you for trying to win me over.

616
00:53:01,943 --> 00:53:02,805
No,

617
00:53:08,218 --> 00:53:10,817
I should say thank you for being my boyfriend.

618
00:54:15,325 --> 00:54:16,838
This will be as far as we go tonight.

619
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:52,223
You are such a tease, Zo.

620
00:55:37,693 --> 00:55:41,448
That's enough compliments for one day.

621
00:55:42,661 --> 00:55:45,500
I just want to keep looking at my boyfriend.

622
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:48,903
I've received calls from this number, but no one speaks when I answer.

623
00:55:49,673 --> 00:55:51,484
This is quite strange.

624
00:55:51,977 --> 00:55:53,977
No one in their right mind would write your name like that.

625
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:58,859
I didn't see your new friend when I came to get you.

626
00:56:00,168 --> 00:56:01,176
Who is he?

627
00:56:05,743 --> 00:56:06,608
Excuse me.
