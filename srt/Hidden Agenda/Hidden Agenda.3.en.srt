1
00:00:00,065 --> 00:00:02,669
You will debate in front of Wave

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:04,640
I will make sure you can get in.

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,640
Say it as you would, and I’ll give it a listen.

4
00:00:08,015 --> 00:00:11,665
I feel like I have a crush on someone.

5
00:00:12,693 --> 00:00:14,000
Who would you like me to debate with?

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,693
Zo.

7
00:00:14,693 --> 00:00:16,982
For the debate today, it’s a tie.

8
00:00:16,982 --> 00:00:18,595
So, am I in?

9
00:00:18,595 --> 00:00:21,681
Anyone with more than half the votes gets into the club.

10
00:00:21,681 --> 00:00:24,390
You're the buddy I coached who made it into the club.

11
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,183
Just don't forget the little favor I asked you for.

12
00:00:27,183 --> 00:00:28,316
Well… I’ve actually already started.

13
00:00:37,667 --> 00:00:40,503
Hey, what are you waiting for? Take some notes.

14
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,447
I mean… aren’t you taking this a bit too seriously?

15
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,200
If you’re not into it,

16
00:00:47,056 --> 00:00:47,999
please leave.

17
00:00:48,653 --> 00:00:49,567
I’ll show you the door.

18
00:00:54,582 --> 00:00:57,858
Okay, I’m all in.

19
00:00:59,745 --> 00:01:00,600
It’s good that you’re taking this seriously.

20
00:01:01,741 --> 00:01:04,960
Winning someone over is no joke.

21
00:01:06,009 --> 00:01:07,526
Before you get to know them,

22
00:01:08,341 --> 00:01:09,599
you must first know yourself.

23
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:17,670
Know yourself…

24
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:19,556
What’s that supposed to mean?

25
00:01:21,642 --> 00:01:22,359
You will find out soon.

26
00:01:23,521 --> 00:01:24,804
Just trust me.

27
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:28,793
Alright?

28
00:01:28,997 --> 00:01:30,440
Take notes.

29
00:01:31,252 --> 00:01:33,252
Your handwriting is chicken scratch.

30
00:01:33,769 --> 00:01:35,219
Can you even read this later?

31
00:01:35,411 --> 00:01:37,411
What about the second point?

32
00:01:37,924 --> 00:01:40,495
You can't do it like this. You need to make a table.

33
00:01:40,495 --> 00:01:44,695
Watch this. This will make it less confusing.

34
00:02:39,602 --> 00:02:43,498
Rule no. 1, know your personality and posture.

35
00:02:44,176 --> 00:02:47,073
Thanks for the unsolicited advice.

36
00:02:48,059 --> 00:02:51,935
And here I thought I taught you public speaking.

37
00:02:53,077 --> 00:02:57,768
Speaking and posture are two different ball games.

38
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,778
Watch me.

39
00:03:10,141 --> 00:03:13,670
Proper posture can make you stand out.

40
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:21,636
Even in a uniform, not everyone looks the same.

41
00:03:23,438 --> 00:03:24,260
Nita…

42
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:26,315
Zo!

43
00:03:37,413 --> 00:03:38,022
Let’s move.

44
00:03:39,449 --> 00:03:40,231
Where?

45
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,979
Our session isn’t over yet.

46
00:03:42,161 --> 00:03:44,548
We’re about to work on that posture.

47
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:45,907
Come with me.

48
00:03:50,107 --> 00:03:52,480
If you're not coming, I’m done coaching you.

49
00:03:53,289 --> 00:03:55,289
Joke, wait up!

50
00:04:02,063 --> 00:04:05,082
Why are we here? It's freaking hot.

51
00:04:06,652 --> 00:04:08,652
Stop complaining and listen to me.

52
00:04:09,602 --> 00:04:10,253
Go over there.

53
00:04:13,278 --> 00:04:14,464
Show me your walk.

54
00:04:18,852 --> 00:04:19,760
Are you feeling sick?

55
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:20,985
Why are you walking like that?

56
00:04:20,985 --> 00:04:22,186
Come on, go back.

57
00:04:22,585 --> 00:04:25,340
Chest out. Out.

58
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,138
Shoulders up.

59
00:04:27,444 --> 00:04:27,990
Up.

60
00:04:28,187 --> 00:04:29,216
And roll them backward.

61
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,646
Tummy in.

62
00:04:30,836 --> 00:04:31,926
Tummy.

63
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:32,877
Is it tucked in?

64
00:04:32,877 --> 00:04:33,741
It is.

65
00:04:33,741 --> 00:04:36,422
Don't do this with your legs. That’s not how normal people walk.

66
00:04:44,523 --> 00:04:45,855
Chest out.

67
00:04:45,855 --> 00:04:47,237
Shoulders back.

68
00:04:47,717 --> 00:04:48,379
Stomach in.

69
00:04:48,379 --> 00:04:48,879
In.

70
00:04:49,062 --> 00:04:50,410
Walk with long strides.

71
00:04:50,949 --> 00:04:52,949
Maintain a steady pace. Not too slow.

72
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:55,524
Now, give this a try.

73
00:04:56,747 --> 00:04:58,520
Walk naturally, alright?

74
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,247
Do not drop the book.

75
00:05:01,307 --> 00:05:03,111
One, two, three!

76
00:05:09,244 --> 00:05:09,960
Damn it!

77
00:05:37,248 --> 00:05:39,093
Let's move on to the next exercise.

78
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,170
Why on earth are we here?

79
00:06:03,157 --> 00:06:05,377
Besides posture,

80
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:12,197
how you dress is just as important.

81
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,673
There is no hard and fast rule about how you should dress.

82
00:06:17,027 --> 00:06:19,577
But if you want to catch someone's eye,

83
00:06:21,667 --> 00:06:22,843
you've got to stand out from the crowd.

84
00:06:23,667 --> 00:06:26,754
I'm not keen on buying clothes. They're pricey.

85
00:06:29,504 --> 00:06:30,360
Let me tell you something.

86
00:06:30,768 --> 00:06:34,134
Fashion isn't about price tags.

87
00:06:35,868 --> 00:06:36,855
It's about taste.

88
00:06:41,014 --> 00:06:41,782
Come on.

89
00:06:45,533 --> 00:06:48,206
A shirt, a T-shirt, and a pair of jeans.

90
00:06:48,804 --> 00:06:51,395
They look great but… would they look good on me?

91
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:52,866
You will never know until you try them on.

92
00:06:55,761 --> 00:06:56,572
Cute.

93
00:06:56,637 --> 00:06:57,283
Is it a good fit for me?

94
00:06:59,362 --> 00:07:00,716
This looks cool.

95
00:07:00,904 --> 00:07:02,129
Does this suit me?

96
00:07:09,131 --> 00:07:10,521
You've got an eye for this stuff.

97
00:07:11,867 --> 00:07:12,844
Maybe not!

98
00:07:13,138 --> 00:07:14,567
Don't you trust my taste?

99
00:07:22,313 --> 00:07:23,045
Zo!

100
00:07:23,677 --> 00:07:24,517
You ready in there?

101
00:07:27,938 --> 00:07:28,654
All set.

102
00:07:45,461 --> 00:07:48,725
That long stare—is it a good sign or a bad one?

103
00:07:51,711 --> 00:07:52,525
It's not too bad.

104
00:07:53,096 --> 00:07:53,921
Not too bad?

105
00:07:54,533 --> 00:07:56,360
That means it's terrible.

106
00:07:56,664 --> 00:07:58,277
I knew these wouldn't work for me.

107
00:07:59,557 --> 00:08:04,268
But if you never try new things, how will you know what suits you?

108
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:13,080
I'm referring to clothes here.

109
00:08:17,073 --> 00:08:18,828
But I just don't feel confident in this.

110
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:22,686
Wait here.

111
00:08:41,218 --> 00:08:42,165
I'll wear this too.

112
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:47,320
I know you mean well, but you don't have to do this for me.

113
00:08:47,449 --> 00:08:48,684
Who said it’s for you?

114
00:08:51,722 --> 00:08:52,487
Jerk!

115
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:54,549
I’m doing this for me.

116
00:08:55,956 --> 00:08:56,895
What’s your deal?

117
00:09:36,366 --> 00:09:38,366
Why on earth are you loitering around? Come and take a seat.

118
00:09:39,396 --> 00:09:40,161
No,

119
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,457
I'm just taken aback that you beat me and Zo here.

120
00:09:45,457 --> 00:09:49,358
Can't you believe I also want to better myself?

121
00:09:49,619 --> 00:09:51,735
It's quite disappointing that you're judging a book by its cover.

122
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:53,065
Unacceptable.

123
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,539
Pat, be straight with me.

124
00:09:59,018 --> 00:10:00,856
I'm waiting for my dear friend Zo.

125
00:10:00,857 --> 00:10:03,781
I haven't even started my assignment, and it's due today.

126
00:10:03,781 --> 00:10:07,574
I need his help. Otherwise, you wouldn’t see me here.

127
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,641
What’s eating you?

128
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:27,999
Here comes Zo.

129
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,680
Zo’s arrival isn’t a cause for alarm…

130
00:10:33,973 --> 00:10:36,689
Have you two been waiting long?

131
00:10:37,318 --> 00:10:38,462
Good sir, who might you be?

132
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,036
This is not my friend Zo. Who are you?

133
00:10:41,209 --> 00:10:43,694
Tell me right now, or I’ll call the police.

134
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,273
Give me back my friend.

135
00:10:45,521 --> 00:10:48,080
Why the drama?

136
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,214
Well, look at him.

137
00:10:50,081 --> 00:10:53,537
We might need an exorcism. He must be possessed.

138
00:10:53,537 --> 00:10:55,522
What else could explain such a dramatic transformation?

139
00:10:56,854 --> 00:11:00,080
Judging by your reaction, I don’t look good, do I?

140
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:03,161
You look great.

141
00:11:03,301 --> 00:11:04,661
What exactly did you do?

142
00:11:04,938 --> 00:11:06,294
I just…

143
00:11:06,294 --> 00:11:07,017
Zo!

144
00:11:11,036 --> 00:11:12,036
Come with me.

145
00:11:13,862 --> 00:11:17,640
Guys, I’ll be back. Let’s catch up later.

146
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,705
See you.

147
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:19,653
Okay…

148
00:11:24,221 --> 00:11:26,799
Since when did they become so tight-knit?

149
00:11:28,561 --> 00:11:30,376
Or maybe…

150
00:11:31,093 --> 00:11:32,452
What are you smiling about?

151
00:11:32,868 --> 00:11:34,734
I’m smiling through my problems.

152
00:11:34,734 --> 00:11:35,921
My homework isn't going to complete itself.

153
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,574
Since Zo isn’t around,

154
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:40,550
you take care of this while I distract myself with a game.

155
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:46,132
You dragged me out here, so what's going on?

156
00:11:46,601 --> 00:11:48,509
There's something I need you to tackle today.

157
00:11:49,502 --> 00:11:52,149
Have you ever heard of the triangular theory of love?

158
00:11:53,307 --> 00:11:56,393
It breaks love down into three components.

159
00:11:57,507 --> 00:12:00,478
First is passion.

160
00:12:01,437 --> 00:12:04,130
Second is intimacy.

161
00:12:04,801 --> 00:12:08,812
And third is commitment.

162
00:12:10,081 --> 00:12:13,190
Right now, you've got passion down pat.

163
00:12:13,761 --> 00:12:15,299
But you're lacking in the other two areas.

164
00:12:15,807 --> 00:12:16,782
So…

165
00:12:16,782 --> 00:12:18,177
You need to ask Nita out.

166
00:12:18,177 --> 00:12:20,239
That's how you'll build intimacy and commitment.

167
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,353
Are you out of your mind?

168
00:12:23,155 --> 00:12:25,802
I see her every day and I can barely muster up the courage

169
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:28,226
to start a conversation, let alone ask her out.

170
00:12:28,928 --> 00:12:32,476
And you haven't coached me on any of this yet.

171
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:36,568
Well then, let’s meet this Saturday at 10.

172
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:41,960
Your task is to plan a mock date with Nita.

173
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:43,928
I'll be there to fine-tune the details.

174
00:12:44,413 --> 00:12:45,134
Wait a minute.

175
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:51,989
So you're telling me you'd play Nita, and I'd be...dating you?

176
00:12:54,137 --> 00:12:57,593
This is...unorthodox. How is this going to work?

177
00:12:57,921 --> 00:12:59,026
Why wouldn’t it?

178
00:13:00,644 --> 00:13:04,220
If you can't handle this, how can you expect to woo her?

179
00:13:10,258 --> 00:13:11,495
Oh, man.

180
00:13:26,356 --> 00:13:27,963
The triangular theory.

00:14:43,722 --> 00:14:45,080
This is your idea of a place for a date?

187
00:14:49,004 --> 00:14:51,920
I don't know where else to take Nita.

188
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,116
I did my homework. She loves spending time in the park.

189
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,956
So, you said you'd coach me.

190
00:15:01,309 --> 00:15:02,038
Ready to get started?

191
00:15:15,392 --> 00:15:16,676
This is your first mistake.

192
00:15:17,932 --> 00:15:21,596
That's not a gaze, it's a downright stare.

193
00:15:28,693 --> 00:15:29,754
What's the difference?

194
00:15:30,424 --> 00:15:32,056
When you're on a date with someone,

195
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:35,768
rule number one is not to gawk at them.

196
00:15:36,942 --> 00:15:38,803
That can make them feel uncomfortable.

197
00:15:39,497 --> 00:15:43,993
You should look at them, not with intensity, but with genuine interest.

198
00:15:45,183 --> 00:15:45,953
Okay.

199
00:15:47,183 --> 00:15:48,043
Let’s move on.

200
00:15:49,135 --> 00:15:51,482
I'll be evaluating your date performance.

201
00:15:51,841 --> 00:15:53,587
At the end of the day, I'll grade you.

202
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:56,924
Whether you pass or fail is my call.

203
00:16:00,401 --> 00:16:01,202
Fine.

204
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,284
Let’s go.

205
00:16:08,095 --> 00:16:09,309
Hey, slow down!

206
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,479
Keep up with me.

207
00:16:13,157 --> 00:16:14,371
Why are you going so fast?

208
00:16:15,797 --> 00:16:17,797
Why don't you try riding without holding on?

209
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:20,080
That would be dangerous.

210
00:16:20,576 --> 00:16:22,183
Just ride carefully.

211
00:16:36,027 --> 00:16:37,311
You lead this time.

212
00:16:40,081 --> 00:16:40,784
Let’s go.

213
00:16:41,108 --> 00:16:41,850
Go!

214
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:07,533
Ah!

215
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,045
Zo!

216
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:13,542
Damn!

217
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,425
Zo, are you alright?

218
00:17:21,076 --> 00:17:22,201
A bit bruised.

219
00:17:25,321 --> 00:17:26,774
Are you okay?

220
00:17:27,585 --> 00:17:28,614
-I’m fine.
-He’s fine.

221
00:17:29,659 --> 00:17:30,951
I’m so sorry.

222
00:17:31,552 --> 00:17:32,260
Thank you.

223
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,241
So sorry.

224
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,739
I told you, you can look but not stare.

225
00:17:38,961 --> 00:17:40,195
You were staring.

226
00:17:43,246 --> 00:17:44,012
Come on.

227
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:00,287
Come with me.

228
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:02,627
I’ll ride.

229
00:18:03,551 --> 00:18:04,343
Hey.

230
00:18:07,579 --> 00:18:09,158
If you were Nita,

231
00:18:10,498 --> 00:18:12,151
you probably wouldn’t ride with me on the companion saddle.

232
00:18:15,549 --> 00:18:18,289
This is me, not Nita.

233
00:18:32,932 --> 00:18:33,776
Hurry up!

234
00:18:41,214 --> 00:18:42,544
You are quite heavy.

235
00:18:43,325 --> 00:18:44,493
You’re not so light yourself.

236
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:46,538
Well, I'm the one pedaling.

237
00:18:47,556 --> 00:18:49,425
Try to keep balanced.

238
00:18:49,918 --> 00:18:51,086
What are you doing?

239
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:59,032
Try to keep balanced.

240
00:19:14,141 --> 00:19:15,202
What are you doing?

241
00:19:18,784 --> 00:19:19,723
Just hold tight.

242
00:19:31,363 --> 00:19:32,301
Isn't this cute?

243
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,142
It’s okay.

244
00:19:38,415 --> 00:19:39,523
But mine is way cuter.

245
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:43,166
Where is this supposed to be cute?

246
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,323
Everywhere.

247
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,162
What did you do?

248
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:57,676
Don’t.

249
00:20:00,629 --> 00:20:05,703
Rule number two, ease into it, don’t rush.

250
00:20:06,859 --> 00:20:12,580
When you want to touch her, do it gently, okay?

251
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,013
Got it.

252
00:20:20,577 --> 00:20:22,199
May I wipe your face?

253
00:20:25,695 --> 00:20:26,539
If you must.

254
00:20:42,044 --> 00:20:43,003
Did you hit the jackpot or something?

255
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,964
I’m making it worse.

256
00:20:44,964 --> 00:20:45,544
Look.

257
00:20:47,499 --> 00:20:48,453
Are you doing this on purpose?

258
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,152
I’m not. Not at all.

259
00:20:53,978 --> 00:20:54,889
What are you doing?

260
00:20:54,889 --> 00:20:55,816
Don’t try to get out of this.

261
00:20:55,816 --> 00:20:56,581
What is this?

262
00:20:56,581 --> 00:20:57,280
Let go!

263
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,349
You should wipe your face.

264
00:20:58,349 --> 00:21:02,020
Rule number three, do whatever Joke says.

265
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:04,361
Joke isn’t Nita.

266
00:21:04,556 --> 00:21:05,240
Come here.

267
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,348
No!

268
00:21:09,763 --> 00:21:10,551
Don’t run.

269
00:21:11,498 --> 00:21:13,382
You’re scaring the kids.

270
00:21:13,382 --> 00:21:15,047
Stop acting like a child.

271
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,210
Thank you.

272
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,847
Enjoy your evening.

273
00:21:31,847 --> 00:21:32,962
Thank you.

274
00:21:38,336 --> 00:21:39,123
How is this?

275
00:21:40,012 --> 00:21:41,047
Isn’t this place beautiful?

276
00:21:42,265 --> 00:21:44,265
I saw Nita post a photo of it on her Instagram once.

277
00:21:44,265 --> 00:21:45,711
I thought it'd be nice to bring her back here.

278
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,807
Thank you.

279
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:07,184
Can I get a salmon steak with mustard cream sauce, please?

280
00:22:08,274 --> 00:22:13,653
And a sirloin steak with pepper sauce, medium rare.

281
00:22:14,242 --> 00:22:15,797
What would you like to drink?

282
00:22:15,797 --> 00:22:18,563
A bottle of this year's red burgundy, please.

283
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:21,146
Yes.

284
00:22:23,947 --> 00:22:25,357
Please give us a few moments.

285
00:22:25,357 --> 00:22:26,031
Of course.

286
00:22:26,031 --> 00:22:26,701
Thank you.

287
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:30,247
Do you come here that often?

288
00:22:30,727 --> 00:22:32,016
To this fancy restaurant?

289
00:22:32,168 --> 00:22:34,257
I used to come here with my dad when we would eat out.

290
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:37,364
This is the first time I've been to a place like this.

291
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,754
Just the question I wanted to ask you.

292
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,057
Why bring her somewhere like this for a date?

293
00:22:45,275 --> 00:22:49,298
I don't know. I just thought... she might like it?

294
00:22:49,981 --> 00:22:51,225
Let me tell you.

295
00:22:51,705 --> 00:22:55,484
What you see of someone may not be their whole story.

296
00:22:56,308 --> 00:23:00,040
And you—is this really you?

297
00:23:04,286 --> 00:23:05,785
Final lesson for today, Zo.

298
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:13,344
Stay true to who you are on your first date.

299
00:23:14,613 --> 00:23:18,214
That's what will draw her in.

300
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:20,021
Otherwise, you'll struggle in the long run.

301
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:27,022
For today's date,

302
00:23:29,356 --> 00:23:30,411
I'd say you didn't pass.

303
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:47,089
So what would make a good date in your eyes?

304
00:23:49,139 --> 00:23:50,209
Think about it this way.

305
00:23:50,765 --> 00:23:55,728
How do you want your crush to feel during your date?

306
00:23:57,567 --> 00:23:59,345
You want them to feel special.

307
00:24:01,036 --> 00:24:02,747
To feel their heart race a little.

308
00:24:04,521 --> 00:24:05,854
No matter where you take them,

309
00:24:07,134 --> 00:24:11,847
be it a fancy place or a simple one,

310
00:24:13,107 --> 00:24:18,309
you want them to remember every moment you share together.

311
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,698
Does that make sense?

312
00:24:26,721 --> 00:24:27,454
Yeah.

313
00:24:37,885 --> 00:24:38,864
You haven't said yet.

314
00:24:40,598 --> 00:24:42,397
Where would you take me for a do-over?

315
00:24:43,749 --> 00:24:44,297
Oh,

316
00:24:46,387 --> 00:24:47,421
I know!

317
00:24:49,415 --> 00:24:50,173
Where to?

318
00:25:00,069 --> 00:25:01,030
Here?

319
00:25:01,847 --> 00:25:03,375
This is where you're thinking of taking Nita on a date?

320
00:25:03,848 --> 00:25:05,137
You said it yourself.

321
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:09,217
Find something in common between me and Nita.

322
00:25:09,528 --> 00:25:13,840
This is it. We both like coming here to read.

323
00:25:17,161 --> 00:25:18,255
What are you doing, man?

324
00:25:19,544 --> 00:25:21,050
Today, I'm just going to be myself.

325
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:25,154
Try asking me out.

326
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:28,906
Ask you out?

327
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:34,525
Well…

328
00:25:37,656 --> 00:25:39,189
Umm… I…

329
00:25:39,709 --> 00:25:41,175
You've already messed it up from the start.

330
00:25:42,008 --> 00:25:44,008
You might as well forget about the whole library date.

331
00:25:46,194 --> 00:25:48,194
Hey, wait a second.

332
00:25:58,092 --> 00:25:59,358
Nita.

333
00:26:08,102 --> 00:26:09,791
Would you like to go on a date with me?

334
00:26:28,294 --> 00:26:30,561
You can't just keep walking away.

335
00:26:32,371 --> 00:26:36,150
This is just practice, right?

336
00:26:36,488 --> 00:26:39,978
What did I do wrong?

337
00:26:43,553 --> 00:26:45,798
Nothing. It’s just…

338
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:49,381
When you were asking, your face…

339
00:26:51,715 --> 00:26:52,713
What about my face?

340
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:56,961
Your face….

341
00:27:00,287 --> 00:27:01,137
Was funny.

342
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,510
My face was funny?

343
00:27:05,007 --> 00:27:08,007
Joke, wait up!

344
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:14,281
You like to read in your free time?

345
00:27:16,441 --> 00:27:17,182
Yeah.

346
00:27:18,441 --> 00:27:20,767
What do you like to do in your free time?

347
00:27:23,173 --> 00:27:27,574
I heard you enjoy listening to my podcast.

348
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:32,029
I listen to it before bed because your voice puts me to sleep.

349
00:27:34,975 --> 00:27:39,020
That's good because I've got something to tell you. Wait here.

350
00:27:50,699 --> 00:27:51,509
What is this book?

351
00:27:51,847 --> 00:27:54,949
It's called "Legend of Love". It's really good.

352
00:27:55,615 --> 00:27:56,972
I’ll read it to you.

353
00:27:57,615 --> 00:27:59,236
Come on, take a seat.

354
00:28:05,701 --> 00:28:06,392
Here it is.

355
00:28:07,127 --> 00:28:13,172
I remember reading this when I was a kid. I absolutely loved it.

356
00:28:13,408 --> 00:28:14,697
What's the story?

357
00:28:15,466 --> 00:28:18,422
Aphrodite/Venus.

358
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:20,710
Have you heard of her?

359
00:28:24,245 --> 00:28:30,434
Aphrodite/Venus is the goddess of love and beauty in Greek mythology.

360
00:28:32,571 --> 00:28:38,373
According to the legend, Aphrodite could bewitch even the wisest man,

361
00:28:39,292 --> 00:28:44,649
making him fall madly in love without a second thought.

362
00:28:46,848 --> 00:28:52,027
Aphrodite fell in love with a hunter named Adonis, who was roaming in the woods.

363
00:28:52,347 --> 00:28:57,749
One day, Aphrodite was away, and Adonis was out hunting by himself.

364
00:28:58,352 --> 00:29:03,167
He, being alone that day, encountered and was attacked by a wild boar,

365
00:29:03,333 --> 00:29:06,667
leaving him severely wounded.

366
00:29:10,568 --> 00:29:15,592
Hearing his cries, Aphrodite rushed to him.

367
00:29:16,174 --> 00:29:19,375
On her way, she accidentally stepped on a thorny rose, causing her to bleed.

368
00:29:19,978 --> 00:29:24,046
By the time she got to Adonis, it was too late.

369
00:29:24,968 --> 00:29:26,968
Overwhelmed with grief, she wept,

370
00:29:28,062 --> 00:29:32,530
and her tears mingled with Adonis’ blood.

371
00:29:32,768 --> 00:29:37,881
As the blood seeped into the ground, it dyed the roses,

372
00:29:37,881 --> 00:29:41,209
which were originally white, turning them red.

373
00:29:41,528 --> 00:29:47,597
That’s how, according to legend, red roses came to symbolize love.

374
00:29:49,617 --> 00:29:50,594
Wow.

375
00:29:52,675 --> 00:29:58,988
There's so much more I could tell you. We'll get into that later.

376
00:30:01,492 --> 00:30:06,138
If you were Aphrodite, what would you do?

377
00:30:09,567 --> 00:30:11,100
I'd be devastated.

378
00:30:13,171 --> 00:30:16,661
Honestly, I think I'd react pretty much the same way Aphrodite did.

379
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:19,403
If it were me,

380
00:30:22,071 --> 00:30:24,103
I wouldn’t leave Adonis alone in the first place.

381
00:30:29,238 --> 00:30:35,262
I would never let someone I love face danger alone.

382
00:31:10,777 --> 00:31:13,066
I need to use the restroom.

383
00:31:14,219 --> 00:31:15,307
Go ahead.

384
00:31:52,657 --> 00:31:54,479
You want them to feel special.

385
00:31:54,887 --> 00:31:56,709
To feel their heart race a little.

386
00:31:56,888 --> 00:32:00,607
No matter where, be it a fancy place or a simple one,

387
00:32:01,156 --> 00:32:04,668
you want them to remember every moment you share together.

388
00:32:05,488 --> 00:32:09,756
I would never let someone I love face danger alone.

389
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:17,696
Argh!

390
00:32:45,545 --> 00:32:46,993
I’ll be right back.

391
00:32:50,194 --> 00:32:51,056
Nita!

392
00:32:52,089 --> 00:32:53,419
Hey, Zo.

393
00:32:59,545 --> 00:33:00,680
Umm…

394
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:05,033
Umm… I…

395
00:33:07,509 --> 00:33:09,053
Whatever it is, you can tell me.

396
00:33:13,546 --> 00:33:17,371
Well, I was hoping you could join me at the library after our club meet.

397
00:33:18,409 --> 00:33:22,715
I could really use your insights for an assignment in Mr. Niti’s class.

398
00:33:24,621 --> 00:33:26,407
Of course. No problem.

399
00:33:27,017 --> 00:33:28,327
I'm free this evening.

400
00:33:28,328 --> 00:33:31,217
Let's meet up once the club session wraps up.

401
00:33:32,471 --> 00:33:33,923
That sounds perfect.

402
00:33:34,127 --> 00:33:35,179
See you then.

403
00:33:35,491 --> 00:33:36,257
See you.

404
00:33:39,437 --> 00:33:40,270
Yes!

405
00:33:41,437 --> 00:33:42,292
Woo!

406
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:50,668
Pok.

407
00:33:54,006 --> 00:33:54,989
What are you doing here?

408
00:33:55,482 --> 00:33:57,002
Isn't this our club space?

409
00:33:57,718 --> 00:33:58,600
You're right.

410
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,231
Anyway, I need to dash off. Catch you later.

411
00:34:05,847 --> 00:34:06,541
Zo,

412
00:34:07,165 --> 00:34:08,711
what are we doing here?

413
00:34:09,045 --> 00:34:12,870
Weren't we supposed to discuss the assignment?

414
00:34:17,831 --> 00:34:20,215
Yes, of course.

415
00:34:21,486 --> 00:34:25,599
But, before we get to that, there's a story I'd love to share with you.

416
00:34:28,222 --> 00:34:30,918
Can you please wait here? I’ll be right back.

417
00:34:46,368 --> 00:34:47,223
Hold on a second.

418
00:34:49,912 --> 00:34:50,503
Here it is.

419
00:34:51,224 --> 00:34:53,690
The story of Sunflower Clytie.

420
00:34:56,161 --> 00:35:00,923
Clytie had an affair with Apollo, the sun god.

421
00:35:01,208 --> 00:35:06,666
But Apollo left her for another woman.

422
00:35:06,928 --> 00:35:12,146
Clytie, however, harbored hopes that her love would return.

423
00:35:12,567 --> 00:35:16,440
For nine straight days, she waited for Apollo to come back,

424
00:35:16,787 --> 00:35:19,772
surviving only on her tears and dew.

425
00:35:20,008 --> 00:35:25,659
Her gaze was fixed on the sun and nothing else.

426
00:35:32,328 --> 00:35:36,730
Clytie lay there until her limbs were stuck under the ground.

427
00:35:37,087 --> 00:35:46,172
Her face turned into a sunflower, always facing the sun.

428
00:35:49,068 --> 00:35:49,732
The end.

429
00:35:51,701 --> 00:35:56,568
What's your take on Clytie's story?

430
00:35:59,746 --> 00:36:02,515
The story doesn’t age well.

431
00:36:03,009 --> 00:36:06,162
The portrayal of women is a bit antiquated, isn't it?

432
00:36:07,602 --> 00:36:10,587
I mean, if I were in Clytie's place, I wouldn't just wait.

433
00:36:11,135 --> 00:36:14,144
If someone doesn't want to be with you, they simply don't.

434
00:36:14,288 --> 00:36:16,768
The sun will never look at you.

435
00:36:17,107 --> 00:36:20,476
Isn't it better to look for someone who truly values you?

436
00:36:24,488 --> 00:36:29,727
True, this is just a story in the book.

437
00:36:29,727 --> 00:36:31,776
I wholeheartedly agree with you.

438
00:36:32,305 --> 00:36:34,425
I've always felt the same way.

439
00:36:35,439 --> 00:36:37,439
Anyway, it's... it's nothing.

440
00:36:38,768 --> 00:36:43,290
Can we talk about the assignment now?

441
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:46,579
There’s this book that could be really useful.

442
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:47,496
Let me show you.

443
00:37:05,421 --> 00:37:06,321
There you are.

444
00:37:07,738 --> 00:37:09,006
You didn’t answer your phone when I called.

445
00:37:10,128 --> 00:37:11,236
Sorry.

446
00:37:11,909 --> 00:37:13,233
My phone died.

447
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,679
What's going on with you?

448
00:37:19,287 --> 00:37:19,960
Nothing.

449
00:37:21,763 --> 00:37:22,810
Is it about Nita?

450
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,621
You know you can talk to me, right?

451
00:37:31,682 --> 00:37:34,427
I had this date with Nita.

452
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:39,080
But something felt off afterward.

453
00:37:40,353 --> 00:37:41,295
How so?

454
00:37:46,442 --> 00:37:47,541
Well…

455
00:37:51,576 --> 00:37:54,903
I didn’t feel my heart race when I was with her.

456
00:38:03,013 --> 00:38:03,731
Hey,

457
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:06,336
it’s okay.

458
00:38:07,945 --> 00:38:08,997
You can take it step by step.

459
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,461
When I have a crush on someone,

460
00:38:16,998 --> 00:38:18,146
I feel the same.

461
00:38:28,447 --> 00:38:31,480
Have you ever heard of the triangular theory of love?

462
00:38:31,576 --> 00:38:34,990
First is passion.

463
00:38:35,842 --> 00:38:38,731
Second is intimacy.

464
00:38:39,208 --> 00:38:43,346
And third is commitment.

465
00:38:50,888 --> 00:38:52,076
Why did you pull my hand away?

466
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,872
Nothing.

467
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:56,021
You're acting kind of strange.

468
00:38:57,198 --> 00:38:58,051
Are you alright?

469
00:39:00,491 --> 00:39:01,746
I need to go.

470
00:39:02,809 --> 00:39:03,895
Let me give you a ride.

471
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:05,367
No need.

472
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,108
I’ll give you a ride.

473
00:39:07,108 --> 00:39:07,889
Come on.

474
00:39:09,794 --> 00:39:10,577
Come.

475
00:39:14,516 --> 00:39:16,598
Let’s go. What are you waiting for?

476
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:19,926
Come on!

477
00:39:41,201 --> 00:39:44,570
Winning someone over is no joke.

478
00:39:45,195 --> 00:39:48,996
Before you get to know them, you must first know yourself.

479
00:39:49,739 --> 00:39:50,994
What’s that supposed to mean?

480
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:52,916
You will find out soon.

481
00:39:53,889 --> 00:39:55,270
Just trust me.

482
00:39:55,879 --> 00:39:57,300
But I just don't feel confident in this.

483
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:58,767
I'll wear this too.

484
00:40:00,887 --> 00:40:03,127
I'll be evaluating your date performance.

485
00:40:04,845 --> 00:40:06,485
If you were Nita,

486
00:40:06,808 --> 00:40:08,287
you probably wouldn’t ride with me on the companion saddle.

487
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,440
This is me, not Nita.

488
00:40:16,368 --> 00:40:20,457
I would never let someone I love face danger alone.

489
00:40:34,823 --> 00:40:35,454
Yes.

490
00:40:35,958 --> 00:40:38,576
Hello, may I speak to Mr. Sitang, please?

491
00:40:38,576 --> 00:40:39,504
This is he.

492
00:40:39,798 --> 00:40:43,863
You have a ticket reservation with us for Chiang Khan today.

493
00:40:43,863 --> 00:40:45,513
Is your plan confirmed?

494
00:40:50,828 --> 00:40:51,739
Mr. Sitang?

495
00:40:53,756 --> 00:40:56,046
Yes, it is confirmed.

496
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,972
Thank you.

497
00:41:33,163 --> 00:41:33,962
(Let’s go.)

498
00:41:46,989 --> 00:41:47,881
Joke!

499
00:41:49,058 --> 00:41:50,070
What brings you here?

500
00:41:50,859 --> 00:41:52,859
You were acting weird earlier.

501
00:41:53,168 --> 00:41:54,592
So I wanted to ask you to join me for dinner.

502
00:41:57,359 --> 00:41:58,243
Where are you heading to?

503
00:41:59,287 --> 00:42:00,715
I'm off to Chiang Khan.

504
00:42:00,868 --> 00:42:01,656
What?

505
00:42:02,232 --> 00:42:03,167
Right now?

506
00:42:03,417 --> 00:42:04,080
Yeah,

507
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:09,019
I kind of messed up my ticket booking, so I need to leave immediately.

508
00:42:09,586 --> 00:42:10,799
Are you sure you're okay?

509
00:42:11,784 --> 00:42:13,772
I’m fine.

510
00:42:14,735 --> 00:42:15,721
Let me see your ticket.

511
00:42:16,946 --> 00:42:17,600
Why?

512
00:42:18,167 --> 00:42:18,890
Show me.

513
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:19,783
Why do you want to see it?

514
00:42:20,429 --> 00:42:21,593
Can’t I just have a look?

515
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:24,542
You’re acting like you’re coming along.

516
00:42:38,125 --> 00:42:38,958
Hello.

517
00:42:40,567 --> 00:42:41,367
Is that Somsak Tour?

518
00:42:41,367 --> 00:42:41,998
Hey!

519
00:42:43,779 --> 00:42:45,779
I’d like to book a bus ticket to Chiang Khan for tonight.

520
00:42:45,779 --> 00:42:47,415
What are you doing, Joke?

521
00:42:52,347 --> 00:42:53,225
Thank you.

522
00:42:55,381 --> 00:42:56,503
Seriously, what are you up to, man?

523
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:58,483
I’m coming with you.

524
00:42:59,035 --> 00:42:59,822
What?

525
00:43:01,327 --> 00:43:02,202
But…

526
00:43:03,595 --> 00:43:04,576
Let me come with you.

527
00:43:08,154 --> 00:43:08,991
Please, Zo.

528
00:43:29,045 --> 00:43:30,208
Follow me if you want to come.

529
00:43:34,147 --> 00:43:34,965
Joke!

530
00:44:01,329 --> 00:44:02,249
We’re here.

531
00:44:02,345 --> 00:44:03,161
Isn’t the view amazing?

532
00:44:03,575 --> 00:44:06,367
When a person is sad, he needs some time alone.

533
00:44:06,367 --> 00:44:08,097
Have you tried being in someone else’s company?

534
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:11,367
Why would you go to such lengths for me?

535
00:44:11,367 --> 00:44:15,451
How could anyone leave you sad and alone when you're in this state?

536
00:44:15,696 --> 00:44:17,696
Why are you doing all this stuff for me?

537
00:44:18,089 --> 00:44:24,367
I’m just someone who feels comfortable and warm around you.

538
00:44:24,914 --> 00:44:26,914
You’ve always been kind to me, you know that?

539
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:29,227
When your heart races around someone,

540
00:44:29,227 --> 00:44:31,250
does it mean you have feelings for that person?
