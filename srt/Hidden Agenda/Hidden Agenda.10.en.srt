1
00:00:00,116 --> 00:00:01,519
I'm moving back to my old place.

2
00:00:01,883 --> 00:00:05,698
This is not a big deal. Pok just doesn't trust me.

3
00:00:05,698 --> 00:00:06,826
If he didn't trust you,

4
00:00:06,826 --> 00:00:09,812
would he let you keep your relationship a secret all this time?

5
00:00:09,983 --> 00:00:12,764
You're late. Who's this guy?

6
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:14,173
We are…

7
00:00:14,173 --> 00:00:15,125
He’s my boyfriend.

8
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,010
I know everything.

9
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:19,600
I did it to make this moment possible.

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,331
You think this will get you back on his good side?

11
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:24,304
I’m so sorry, Zo.

12
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:28,120
But I promise that I won’t lie to you again.

13
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:29,334
That wasn't hard, was it?

14
00:01:29,776 --> 00:01:31,523
Zo? Is that you?

15
00:01:32,227 --> 00:01:34,120
Hello, Uncle. How have you been?

16
00:01:34,376 --> 00:01:37,870
Good, good. But you? I've barely caught a glimpse of you.

17
00:01:38,161 --> 00:01:41,907
Been studying in Bangkok. That’s why you don’t see me.

18
00:01:41,907 --> 00:01:43,645
Only get to drop by during the breaks.

19
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,499
Noticed folks dropping by your place.

20
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:50,434
All your mom’s students, but never Ms. Sai's son.

21
00:01:51,343 --> 00:01:53,627
Anyway, head on in. Your ride's on me.

22
00:01:53,788 --> 00:01:55,388
It’s not every day that I see you here.

23
00:01:56,024 --> 00:01:56,847
Thank you very much.

24
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,357
Study hard, kid.

25
00:02:00,228 --> 00:02:01,677
Be a boss when you grow up.

26
00:02:01,677 --> 00:02:02,826
Make your mom proud.

27
00:02:06,466 --> 00:02:07,156
Will do.

28
00:02:52,754 --> 00:02:53,340
Zo!

29
00:02:57,154 --> 00:03:01,509
Why didn’t you call and give me a heads up?

30
00:03:01,509 --> 00:03:02,542
What are you cooking there?

31
00:03:02,677 --> 00:03:06,040
Fried stink bean. I didn't know you were coming.

32
00:03:07,442 --> 00:03:09,442
Have you eaten? You hungry?

33
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:12,042
Just a bit. I haven't eaten anything.

34
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:17,148
I'll tell your dad to make a quick market run. Our pantry’s bare.

35
00:03:18,725 --> 00:03:22,104
Something simple will do. How about sweet pork and an omelet?

36
00:03:22,851 --> 00:03:25,265
Omelet is simple, but sweet pork is not.

37
00:03:26,295 --> 00:03:28,520
Anyway, head upstairs and wait.

38
00:03:28,658 --> 00:03:29,239
Okay.

39
00:03:29,899 --> 00:03:32,200
Fried stink bean and omelet coming right up.

40
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,589
No stink bean, please. It stinks.

41
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,345
Fine.

42
00:03:40,588 --> 00:03:42,059
It’s burning!

43
00:04:18,895 --> 00:04:19,646
Hello.

44
00:04:19,807 --> 00:04:22,435
Hi, there. I missed you, Zo.

45
00:04:22,693 --> 00:04:23,459
What are you doing?

46
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,760
You missed me? We just hung out yesterday!

47
00:04:29,712 --> 00:04:30,579
Still.

48
00:04:31,176 --> 00:04:32,680
It's been a whole day.

49
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,010
Don't you miss me?

50
00:04:36,033 --> 00:04:38,250
What's up with you? What’s with the puppy eyes?

51
00:04:40,297 --> 00:04:41,117
I don’t know.

52
00:04:41,898 --> 00:04:45,445
It feels empty to see you on the screen.

53
00:04:46,718 --> 00:04:50,947
You kind of look goofy on the screen too.

54
00:04:52,588 --> 00:04:53,642
I may look goofy,

55
00:04:54,588 --> 00:04:56,292
but you're looking gorgeous.

56
00:04:56,949 --> 00:04:57,778
Eww!

57
00:04:59,869 --> 00:05:01,109
Made it home okay?

58
00:05:02,438 --> 00:05:06,322
Just got in. You?

59
00:05:06,829 --> 00:05:08,012
I'm sitting here with Grandma.

60
00:05:09,138 --> 00:05:10,323
Grandma, hello.

61
00:05:11,384 --> 00:05:14,763
Tried teaching this boy Tai Chi. Hopeless, I tell ya.

62
00:05:15,345 --> 00:05:17,575
Zo, where are you? Why aren’t you here at my house?

63
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,660
I'm back in my hometown.

64
00:05:21,326 --> 00:05:24,475
I can take you out when I'm back in Bangkok.

65
00:05:25,949 --> 00:05:29,328
Where's your hometown? I’d like to visit your home.

66
00:05:29,997 --> 00:05:32,548
Sure thing. I live in Krabi.

67
00:05:33,007 --> 00:05:35,320
If you’re free, I can show you around.

68
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:38,929
Hold on! Grandma gets an invite,

69
00:05:39,655 --> 00:05:41,655
but I got a hard no?

70
00:05:41,655 --> 00:05:45,652
You can't let your grandma come alone, can you?

71
00:05:46,964 --> 00:05:48,619
I just don't want to be far from you.

72
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:51,193
Zo!

73
00:05:53,192 --> 00:05:54,054
Yes, Mom.

74
00:05:54,797 --> 00:06:00,175
Got to run. Mom’s calling.

75
00:06:02,739 --> 00:06:04,068
I'll call you tonight.

76
00:06:04,436 --> 00:06:05,851
Sure, bye.

77
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,229
Goodbye.

78
00:06:09,379 --> 00:06:10,296
Be right there.

79
00:06:12,226 --> 00:06:15,722
Joke, if you miss Zo that much, why not be there with him?

80
00:06:16,254 --> 00:06:19,840
As I said, he wouldn't let me.

81
00:06:20,001 --> 00:06:22,552
Why not? Are his parents strict?

82
00:06:23,393 --> 00:06:24,186
No,

83
00:06:24,692 --> 00:06:27,370
I met his mom. She’s nice.

84
00:06:28,407 --> 00:06:31,349
Every family has its quirks.

85
00:06:33,275 --> 00:06:38,423
By the way, spending your birthday with me this year?

86
00:06:41,689 --> 00:06:43,138
What about others?

87
00:06:43,827 --> 00:06:48,837
Jeng said he’d take your parents out somewhere.

88
00:06:51,445 --> 00:06:54,479
No, maybe? I’ll probably go sing at the bar.

89
00:07:08,237 --> 00:07:12,512
So, Zo, how’s school been?

90
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,374
Just finished the exams.

91
00:07:17,063 --> 00:07:18,052
I think I did alright.

92
00:07:19,421 --> 00:07:24,822
And what about that debate club? Entered any competitions?

93
00:07:26,581 --> 00:07:27,915
One’s coming up.

94
00:07:28,087 --> 00:07:34,258
I’m back home to sort out some paperwork for that.

95
00:07:34,258 --> 00:07:36,832
Really? When?

96
00:07:37,361 --> 00:07:39,821
At the start of the next semester.

97
00:07:40,285 --> 00:07:44,238
Very soon! Are you prepared?

98
00:07:45,321 --> 00:07:50,000
Been doing my homework, brushing up on potential debate topics.

99
00:07:50,201 --> 00:07:52,480
Not sure what the actual one is going to be.

100
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,524
And your public speaking? Been practicing?

101
00:07:57,691 --> 00:07:58,268
Well…

102
00:07:58,659 --> 00:08:03,115
Why not run it by me tonight? I can coach you.

103
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:06,579
I can tell you what areas you need to improve.

104
00:08:06,579 --> 00:08:08,702
Sounds good?

105
00:08:08,702 --> 00:08:13,362
He just got home, probably wants to unwind a bit.

106
00:08:13,803 --> 00:08:16,975
This is not school, and here, you're not a teacher,

107
00:08:16,975 --> 00:08:18,469
and he’s not your student.

108
00:08:19,315 --> 00:08:24,187
Zo isn’t my student, but he’s my son.

109
00:08:24,187 --> 00:08:25,755
I am a Thai language teacher.

110
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:31,304
If he lost? How could I face my class? Can’t you see?

111
00:08:35,035 --> 00:08:37,035
More omelet?

112
00:08:38,793 --> 00:08:39,831
Eat more.

113
00:08:39,831 --> 00:08:43,275
You’ll need fuel for an intensive tutoring session tonight.

114
00:08:43,275 --> 00:08:45,260
Maybe ease up a touch?

115
00:08:45,518 --> 00:08:47,518
I’ve got a good feeling that he will win.

116
00:08:47,518 --> 00:08:49,919
Sure, that’s good.

117
00:08:56,157 --> 00:09:00,000
[Recognizing Ms. Kamonthorn Chimwarun as an Exceptional Teacher.]

118
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,873
[Recognizing Ms. Kamonthorn Chimwarun as an Exceptional Teacher.]

119
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:20,799
What’s that smudge?

120
00:09:27,888 --> 00:09:30,486
Oh, Zo, hey.

121
00:09:31,301 --> 00:09:32,207
Hey, Mom.

122
00:09:37,101 --> 00:09:38,930
That award means a lot to you, huh?

123
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:40,113
It sure does.

124
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:45,194
It’s not a walk in the park for me to win this.

125
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:50,720
Think about it, a woman in my position in public service?

126
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:52,530
Not easy at all.

127
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:57,093
My folks couldn't even dream of something like this.

128
00:09:58,695 --> 00:10:03,108
By the way, I've got a debate topic in mind for tonight.

129
00:10:04,892 --> 00:10:05,798
By the way, I've got a debate topic in mind for tonight.

130
00:10:07,177 --> 00:10:14,361
Childhood trauma from parental conflicts results in troubled adults.

131
00:10:15,065 --> 00:10:17,662
Affirmative or Negative?

132
00:10:27,403 --> 00:10:28,597
Negative.

133
00:10:28,597 --> 00:10:29,403
Why?

134
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:32,532
It's just...

135
00:10:33,474 --> 00:10:37,582
It's not that black and white.

136
00:10:39,297 --> 00:10:43,774
Zo, once you’ve made a decision, you can’t be hesitant like this.

137
00:10:43,981 --> 00:10:44,810
Okay?

138
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:48,400
Speak with clarity and conviction.

139
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:50,971
Got it.

140
00:10:57,497 --> 00:10:58,947
It isn't black and white.

141
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:10,354
While upbringing plays a role in shaping someone,

142
00:11:12,324 --> 00:11:15,000
I wouldn’t say it's the end-all.

143
00:11:16,555 --> 00:11:20,000
But didn't you just say it influences?

144
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:26,808
Zo, you can’t fold after one pushback.

145
00:11:26,808 --> 00:11:28,524
How would you survive in the real competition?

146
00:11:30,522 --> 00:11:36,107
Let's do a different topic tonight,

147
00:11:36,403 --> 00:11:37,943
even if it means pulling an all-nighter.

148
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:42,124
What topic can we tackle?

149
00:11:43,179 --> 00:11:45,822
This is too difficult. Would you be up for it?

150
00:11:48,453 --> 00:11:49,879
Let's do an easier one.

151
00:11:50,997 --> 00:11:52,898
How about this one?

152
00:11:53,633 --> 00:11:55,203
This is quite a good topic.

153
00:11:55,203 --> 00:11:57,410
But it might be a bit twisty for you.

154
00:12:23,198 --> 00:12:23,972
What’s up?

155
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:25,499
Whatcha up to?

156
00:12:26,717 --> 00:12:27,684
Just...

157
00:12:29,592 --> 00:12:32,433
lost in thought. It's nothing.

158
00:12:33,437 --> 00:12:34,965
You sound off.

159
00:12:35,568 --> 00:12:36,979
Everything okay?

160
00:12:37,606 --> 00:12:38,368
Your mom?

161
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:46,865
No, nothing. I’m fine.

162
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:49,956
Talk to you later.

163
00:13:21,543 --> 00:13:23,543
Long day at work?

164
00:13:23,794 --> 00:13:24,466
Not really.

165
00:13:25,755 --> 00:13:28,784
Thought you had practice and were grabbing dinner with the boys.

166
00:13:29,527 --> 00:13:31,000
Why are you here picking me up?

167
00:13:34,536 --> 00:13:36,410
I…

168
00:13:40,827 --> 00:13:42,199
I left the club.

169
00:13:48,599 --> 00:13:49,347
Why?

170
00:13:50,276 --> 00:13:51,428
Did something happen?

171
00:13:52,747 --> 00:13:56,931
It's just not my thing anymore. That's all.

172
00:14:00,794 --> 00:14:02,618
But you love football.

173
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:07,051
Yeah,

174
00:14:08,758 --> 00:14:12,373
but I can play anywhere. Doesn't have to be that club.

175
00:14:22,921 --> 00:14:23,866
What's wrong?

176
00:14:39,949 --> 00:14:40,982
What's wrong?

177
00:14:46,707 --> 00:14:48,242
It's because of me, isn't it?

178
00:14:51,665 --> 00:14:52,620
No.

179
00:14:55,206 --> 00:15:01,122
But I did this because I chose you.

180
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:11,032
I’m sorry.

181
00:15:17,781 --> 00:15:18,642
Come here.

182
00:15:22,659 --> 00:15:24,070
It’s okay.

183
00:15:25,777 --> 00:15:26,913
It’s cool.

184
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,759
It’s alright.

185
00:15:32,661 --> 00:15:33,715
I’m sorry.

186
00:15:38,368 --> 00:15:39,754
We got this, together,

187
00:15:41,386 --> 00:15:42,074
okay?

188
00:15:56,509 --> 00:15:57,061
Pok,

189
00:15:58,969 --> 00:16:00,016
you know,

190
00:16:02,965 --> 00:16:04,563
I will always choose you.

191
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,154
I love you.

192
00:16:18,368 --> 00:16:19,568
So so much.

193
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:29,114
Thank you.

194
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:38,863
Truly.

195
00:16:42,777 --> 00:16:45,028
I should have done this a long time ago anyway.

196
00:17:12,175 --> 00:17:14,175
Hey, Joke.

197
00:17:14,744 --> 00:17:15,552
Hi, there.

198
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:18,828
Another round?

199
00:17:19,552 --> 00:17:20,419
I’ve had enough.

200
00:17:24,612 --> 00:17:26,348
What's with the long face?

201
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:30,502
Missing my sweetheart.

202
00:17:31,782 --> 00:17:32,573
Your sweetheart?

203
00:17:33,979 --> 00:17:34,897
You have a sweetheart?

204
00:17:36,303 --> 00:17:39,190
Didn’t I tell you?

205
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:40,980
Who?

206
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,032
You might know him.

207
00:17:46,989 --> 00:17:47,861
It’s Zo.

208
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:53,810
Zo, the one Wave mentors?

209
00:17:54,938 --> 00:17:55,941
You look shocked.

210
00:17:58,151 --> 00:17:59,608
I didn’t say I got together with Wave.

211
00:18:00,857 --> 00:18:01,898
I’m a bit shocked.

212
00:18:04,148 --> 00:18:07,392
Don’t be. Just be happy for me.

213
00:18:08,549 --> 00:18:10,549
I am happy for you.

214
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:13,023
But spill, why the sad face?

215
00:18:14,778 --> 00:18:15,907
Zo is back home.

216
00:18:17,564 --> 00:18:18,987
He’s got some stuff on his mind

217
00:18:20,191 --> 00:18:21,292
while I’m here and not with him.

218
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:25,723
Just go to him and bring him back.

219
00:18:27,183 --> 00:18:29,007
Easy.

220
00:18:29,866 --> 00:18:33,021
I feel like he doesn’t want me there.

221
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:40,446
Trust me,

222
00:18:41,777 --> 00:18:43,368
if the chips are down,

223
00:18:45,435 --> 00:18:48,665
having someone you love close is the best medicine.

224
00:18:50,646 --> 00:18:53,952
Do what you want to do,

225
00:18:55,335 --> 00:18:57,159
before you regret not doing it.

226
00:19:02,327 --> 00:19:03,498
You’re right.

227
00:19:16,016 --> 00:19:17,564
And where are you off to now?

228
00:19:19,932 --> 00:19:23,162
Going to sing, then head out early.

229
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:36,910
♪ Not sure how to make you feel better ♪

230
00:19:40,391 --> 00:19:44,877
♪ If something doesn’t go as planned ♪

231
00:19:45,131 --> 00:19:49,600
♪ If something gets caught in a jam ♪

232
00:19:49,776 --> 00:19:56,472
♪ You can always listen to me ♪

233
00:20:08,023 --> 00:20:08,926
Whatcha up to, kiddo?

234
00:20:14,328 --> 00:20:20,321
Just spacing out.

235
00:20:23,101 --> 00:20:28,993
Shouldn't you be resting? Heard about your back from Mom.

236
00:20:28,993 --> 00:20:33,880
Ah, your mom exaggerates. Just some old-age kinks.

237
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,539
Your body gets worse when you’re old.

238
00:20:43,637 --> 00:20:46,968
Got something weighing on you? Wanna talk about it?

239
00:20:50,923 --> 00:20:51,759
No.

240
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:58,623
Anything you wanna ask then?

241
00:21:01,889 --> 00:21:09,262
I'm curious how you and Mom fell in love.

242
00:21:11,639 --> 00:21:15,042
I mean, she's a strict teacher

243
00:21:17,076 --> 00:21:19,514
and you're...

244
00:21:19,514 --> 00:21:20,802
A simple farmer.

245
00:21:24,933 --> 00:21:26,472
It’s tough.Before this,

246
00:21:28,129 --> 00:21:34,554
we came close to calling it quits a few times.

247
00:21:37,051 --> 00:21:38,019
But, Zo,

248
00:21:40,128 --> 00:21:48,368
one day you’ll find out that love will make the impossible possible.

249
00:21:55,442 --> 00:21:59,049
This too shall pass. It will.

250
00:22:05,246 --> 00:22:05,948
I guess.

251
00:22:07,881 --> 00:22:08,977
Smiling?

252
00:22:10,006 --> 00:22:12,619
Are you smiling now?

253
00:22:24,061 --> 00:22:28,070
It’s so nice of you to visit your old teacher.

254
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:30,270
What about Det? How’s he doing?

255
00:22:30,935 --> 00:22:35,008
That one’s swamped. Internship's keeping him on his toes.

256
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:38,201
Look at him now! Never took him to be the studious type.

257
00:22:38,201 --> 00:22:40,369
It's incredible how well he’s doing.

258
00:22:40,369 --> 00:22:42,455
He's really got his head in the game these days.

259
00:22:43,893 --> 00:22:45,090
It's quite a reunion we have here.

260
00:22:46,293 --> 00:22:49,423
My dears, are you hungry?

261
00:22:49,423 --> 00:22:50,836
There’s food on the table.

262
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:54,719
Meet my husband and son.

263
00:22:54,719 --> 00:22:56,701
Hello.

264
00:22:57,198 --> 00:23:00,448
Your son is around the same age as us.

265
00:23:00,866 --> 00:23:04,368
Yes, he’s studying political science.

266
00:23:04,368 --> 00:23:07,168
Impressive! Nice to meet you.

267
00:23:08,065 --> 00:23:09,021
Nice to meet you too.

268
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:13,368
Honey, gonna lie down for a bit. My back's acting up.

269
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:18,902
Dear, don’t forget your meds, okay? Or they’re just gonna gather dust.

270
00:23:19,008 --> 00:23:21,008
You’ll feel better after taking them.

271
00:23:21,008 --> 00:23:22,270
I know, I know.

272
00:23:23,704 --> 00:23:27,236
He’s always like this. My family gives me a headache sometimes.

273
00:23:28,262 --> 00:23:32,898
Feels like we're back in school. You were always on our case.

274
00:23:32,898 --> 00:23:37,157
You never focused. You could barely keep your eyes open in my class!

275
00:23:38,112 --> 00:23:42,598
Too early in the morning! Can you blame me?

276
00:23:43,014 --> 00:23:45,114
I’m sharper now.

277
00:23:53,522 --> 00:23:54,312
Hello

278
00:23:54,312 --> 00:23:56,915
Hello, Zo. What are you up to? You home?

279
00:23:57,886 --> 00:24:00,463
I'm about to eat. What are you doing?

280
00:24:02,313 --> 00:24:03,205
I’m in front of your house.

281
00:24:03,368 --> 00:24:04,200
What?

282
00:24:07,376 --> 00:24:08,253
Zo,

283
00:24:09,376 --> 00:24:10,499
what’s going on?

284
00:24:12,709 --> 00:24:13,846
Nothing, Mom.

285
00:24:16,015 --> 00:24:19,168
Nothing? I guess my son is pretty jumpy for no reason.

286
00:24:22,477 --> 00:24:23,900
Why are you here?

287
00:24:24,477 --> 00:24:27,916
You sounded off last night, so I was worried.

288
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:32,025
Got your address from Pat, and here I am.

289
00:24:33,342 --> 00:24:34,306
Can you step out?

290
00:24:38,368 --> 00:24:39,404
Hang on.

291
00:24:44,568 --> 00:24:47,874
All my students shine in their own way.

292
00:24:47,874 --> 00:24:51,391
This one is working at an ad agency. A hotshot.

293
00:24:52,954 --> 00:24:54,477
Which agency?

294
00:25:15,216 --> 00:25:16,147
Geez, Joke!

295
00:25:17,628 --> 00:25:18,697
Missed ya.

296
00:25:20,408 --> 00:25:23,368
Man, my folks can see us!

297
00:25:23,771 --> 00:25:24,762
Oops, slipped my mind.

298
00:25:28,578 --> 00:25:29,587
What are you doing here?

299
00:25:31,214 --> 00:25:32,561
To whisk you back to Bangkok.

300
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:35,563
I’m not leaving for Bangkok today.

301
00:25:36,739 --> 00:25:37,676
I'm leaving tomorrow.

302
00:25:40,915 --> 00:25:41,752
Seriously?

303
00:25:45,978 --> 00:25:49,943
Mind if I crash here tonight?

304
00:25:54,036 --> 00:25:54,782
Please?

305
00:25:56,343 --> 00:25:59,128
Brought my stuff and everything.

306
00:26:06,136 --> 00:26:08,136
How’s the food? Smells nice, doesn’t it?

307
00:26:08,136 --> 00:26:10,051
Went all out with my culinary skills today.

308
00:26:10,417 --> 00:26:13,625
Joke, give me a heads up next time you’re coming.

309
00:26:13,625 --> 00:26:16,306
I'll whip up some of your favorites.

310
00:26:16,962 --> 00:26:18,151
That’s totally fine.

311
00:26:18,514 --> 00:26:20,558
Got plenty here to feast on.

312
00:26:23,252 --> 00:26:25,815
So what brought you here?

313
00:26:26,056 --> 00:26:27,718
I was worried about my boy–

314
00:26:29,617 --> 00:26:30,474
What’s that?

315
00:26:32,214 --> 00:26:34,455
My bag full of documents I left with Zo.

316
00:26:36,398 --> 00:26:37,111
Right?

317
00:26:37,111 --> 00:26:38,108
Mmm.

318
00:26:38,108 --> 00:26:39,792
Plus, it's my school break.

319
00:26:39,792 --> 00:26:41,855
Didn't wanna be all alone,

320
00:26:42,749 --> 00:26:48,175
so thought I’d chill here and grab Zo on my way back.

321
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:50,234
Sounds good.

322
00:26:51,732 --> 00:26:53,895
Feel free to bring your pals over anytime.

323
00:26:54,228 --> 00:26:57,243
We’re simple folks.

324
00:26:57,284 --> 00:26:58,695
Good to have you, son.

325
00:26:59,511 --> 00:27:02,357
Enough talking, let’s eat.

326
00:27:03,783 --> 00:27:07,910
Zo, after we eat, show Joke where to stash his stuff in your room.

327
00:27:08,055 --> 00:27:11,836
Stay as long as you want. I need some time to sweep the floor downstairs.

328
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:13,773
Sure.

329
00:27:14,216 --> 00:27:15,371
A big prawn here.

330
00:27:16,216 --> 00:27:17,061
Thank you.

331
00:27:17,061 --> 00:27:19,112
Joke, your plate. A big prawn’s coming your way.

332
00:27:19,774 --> 00:27:25,012
Let the boys have them. You gotta watch your cholesterol.

333
00:27:34,387 --> 00:27:35,941
Your parents seem chill.

334
00:27:36,811 --> 00:27:37,716
Shouldn’t be a problem.

335
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:39,659
Why can’t we just tell them?

336
00:27:42,203 --> 00:27:43,671
Not just yet.

337
00:27:44,488 --> 00:27:46,875
Just wanna wait till after the debate.

338
00:27:47,394 --> 00:27:50,409
I think they'll take it better then.

339
00:27:52,415 --> 00:27:53,237
Let’s talk about you.

340
00:27:53,815 --> 00:27:59,295
Are you here to check up on the whole “mom thing”?

341
00:28:00,702 --> 00:28:01,445
No,

342
00:28:03,016 --> 00:28:04,104
just been missing you.

343
00:28:08,043 --> 00:28:09,186
Aren’t you supposed to sing at the bar?

344
00:28:10,153 --> 00:28:11,010
No.

345
00:28:12,072 --> 00:28:14,700
I told Trin that I needed a break for some me-time.

346
00:28:16,864 --> 00:28:18,864
You’re making it hard for me.

347
00:28:19,249 --> 00:28:21,055
Why didn't you call first?

348
00:28:22,139 --> 00:28:23,313
I just missed you.

349
00:28:24,763 --> 00:28:28,876
Seeing you in person is much better than a phone call.

350
00:28:32,802 --> 00:28:34,575
What if my mom opened the door and saw us?

351
00:28:34,987 --> 00:28:35,935
Didn’t you miss me?

352
00:28:42,702 --> 00:28:43,548
I…

353
00:28:45,543 --> 00:28:46,861
I missed you.

354
00:28:54,041 --> 00:28:54,915
Wow.

355
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,506
My heart is racing.

356
00:29:00,394 --> 00:29:01,036
What?

357
00:29:03,235 --> 00:29:04,335
Can I get a hug?

358
00:29:04,513 --> 00:29:06,055
My mom could come in any time.

359
00:29:06,321 --> 00:29:08,552
Quick one, promise.

360
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:13,912
I missed you.

361
00:29:17,247 --> 00:29:18,584
Zo!

362
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,960
What are you two up to in here?

363
00:29:25,707 --> 00:29:26,879
Nothing.

364
00:29:28,184 --> 00:29:29,302
What’s up?

365
00:29:29,621 --> 00:29:33,023
I forgot to tell you that we’ve got that practice session tonight.

366
00:29:37,008 --> 00:29:37,633
Got it.

367
00:29:39,204 --> 00:29:40,579
Make yourself comfy, Joke.

368
00:29:41,167 --> 00:29:41,731
Thanks.

369
00:29:47,314 --> 00:29:48,291
That was close.

370
00:29:50,763 --> 00:29:53,947
Anyway, what’s this practice about?

371
00:30:07,377 --> 00:30:08,935
Right here, Zo.

372
00:30:08,976 --> 00:30:11,695
Your enunciation is not correct.

373
00:30:11,695 --> 00:30:14,801
One more time. Take a deep breath.

374
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:17,795
Go.

375
00:30:18,278 --> 00:30:22,080
From the crime statistics recorded–

376
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,157
Sta-tis-tics.

377
00:30:23,157 --> 00:30:25,560
Sta-tis-tics recorded,

378
00:30:25,974 --> 00:30:28,651
t shows that 50% of folks experiencing family conflicts–

379
00:30:28,651 --> 00:30:32,031
It-shows-that. Emphasize the ‘50%’,

380
00:30:32,031 --> 00:30:34,159
otherwise, your audience wouldn’t catch it.

381
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:38,665
One more time. You need to enunciate every word clearly.

382
00:30:38,665 --> 00:30:41,847
Mom, I think they get it.

383
00:30:41,847 --> 00:30:42,878
No, Zo.

384
00:30:43,768 --> 00:30:45,213
You’re the son of a Thai language teacher.

385
00:30:45,213 --> 00:30:45,891
You need to speak clearly.

386
00:30:45,891 --> 00:30:46,838
One more go.

387
00:30:47,475 --> 00:30:51,239
From the crime statistics recorded,

388
00:30:51,239 --> 00:30:55,050
it shows that 50% of folks experiencing family conflicts…

389
00:30:55,911 --> 00:31:01,899
‘fa-mi-ly conflicts’, tend to commit crimes.

390
00:31:02,835 --> 00:31:05,367
That’s better. Now try without peeking at your notes.

391
00:31:05,367 --> 00:31:06,838
Oh, come on, Mom!

392
00:31:06,838 --> 00:31:08,037
What?

393
00:31:24,014 --> 00:31:25,078
Why are you still awake?

394
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:27,972
I said you didn’t have to wait up.

395
00:31:28,736 --> 00:31:29,585
I'm not tired.

396
00:31:30,697 --> 00:31:31,727
Plus, I can't sleep.

397
00:32:02,635 --> 00:32:04,635
Your mom's pretty intense, huh?

398
00:32:10,485 --> 00:32:11,208
Yeah,

399
00:32:13,021 --> 00:32:14,105
but I’m used to it.

400
00:32:17,093 --> 00:32:18,513
You holding up okay?

401
00:32:22,809 --> 00:32:28,845
You know, my family was pretty typical once.

402
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:32,124
We had happy times together.

403
00:32:34,101 --> 00:32:35,908
But after I got into that fight with Puen

404
00:32:37,537 --> 00:32:39,827
and the school called our parents,

405
00:32:42,378 --> 00:32:48,994
Mom stopped seeing me as her nerdy goody two-shoes.

406
00:32:52,066 --> 00:32:53,897
What did I do wrong, Zo?

407
00:32:56,096 --> 00:32:57,782
You know how much it hurts.

408
00:32:59,903 --> 00:33:01,903
It cuts deep thinking I messed up somewhere with you.

409
00:33:04,414 --> 00:33:09,024
Things got chilly after that.

410
00:33:10,648 --> 00:33:12,745
Mom wouldn’t talk to me.

411
00:33:18,291 --> 00:33:19,824
As time passed,

412
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:27,928
her old students would drop by for visits.

413
00:33:30,376 --> 00:33:37,983
It made me realize how much she’s proud of them, learning about their wins.

414
00:33:46,577 --> 00:33:47,900
I want to do that too.

415
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:54,656
I want to win the debate competition.

416
00:33:56,744 --> 00:33:58,841
I want to make her proud of me.

417
00:34:14,577 --> 00:34:15,634
You get me, right?

418
00:34:24,455 --> 00:34:25,603
I do, Zo.

419
00:34:28,576 --> 00:34:29,815
I get it completely.

420
00:34:33,554 --> 00:34:37,028
Your family and mine are not so different.

421
00:34:38,902 --> 00:34:39,872
Hey, don’t worry.

422
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:44,744
I’ve got your back from now on.

423
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:50,695
I’ll be by your side, holding your hand through all this.

424
00:34:56,897 --> 00:34:57,834
Smile for me.

425
00:34:59,429 --> 00:35:00,323
Show me a smile.

426
00:35:09,539 --> 00:35:11,273
Hey, easy there!

427
00:35:11,496 --> 00:35:14,729
When tapping rubber, it's all in the wrist.

428
00:35:16,693 --> 00:35:17,601
Like this.

429
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:24,082
Okay.

430
00:35:28,811 --> 00:35:29,659
Whoa!

431
00:35:33,308 --> 00:35:34,291
Nailed it!

432
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:53,521
Where are we?

433
00:36:01,883 --> 00:36:03,646
My childhood hideaway.

434
00:36:12,432 --> 00:36:15,665
Wanna know why we're here?

435
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,054
Sure.

436
00:36:19,577 --> 00:36:23,293
It’s been a long walk, and you’ve been acting weird.

437
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:28,152
You're big on surprises, right?

438
00:36:34,673 --> 00:36:35,537
Out with it!

439
00:36:44,767 --> 00:36:47,395
Here you go.

440
00:36:54,442 --> 00:36:55,363
What for?

441
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:58,231
I couldn't grab a gift for you in time,

442
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:04,688
but I wanted to be the first to wish you well this year. So...

443
00:37:06,056 --> 00:37:06,966
Happy birthday!

444
00:37:08,056 --> 00:37:11,055
You knew?

445
00:37:13,693 --> 00:37:16,055
Your grandma told me.

446
00:37:18,771 --> 00:37:24,348
Wish you good health and lots of happiness.

447
00:37:24,935 --> 00:37:25,880
Thanks, Zo.

448
00:37:28,756 --> 00:37:32,566
It’s my happiest birthday yet.

449
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,068
No,

450
00:37:41,364 --> 00:37:42,338
not here.

451
00:37:43,055 --> 00:37:45,079
My dad might pop up any second.

452
00:37:48,275 --> 00:37:49,152
No one would see us.

453
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:51,991
We're miles from anywhere.

454
00:37:52,627 --> 00:37:53,564
No one’s around.

455
00:38:20,014 --> 00:38:24,358
You know, you didn’t have to get me anything.

456
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:33,538
You're already the best gift I could ever ask for.

457
00:38:38,852 --> 00:38:39,938
Sweet talker.

458
00:38:42,935 --> 00:38:43,849
Am I?

459
00:39:12,442 --> 00:39:15,660
Make sure you call when you get to Bangkok, alright?

460
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:19,540
I will, Dad. And you, look after yourself.

461
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:20,275
Always do.

462
00:39:21,176 --> 00:39:25,460
The competition is just around the corner. Bring home the win.

463
00:39:27,201 --> 00:39:28,046
Honey...

464
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,793
Got it, Mom.

465
00:39:33,052 --> 00:39:36,259
Thank you for your hospitality.

466
00:39:36,259 --> 00:39:37,741
Come back and visit us.

467
00:39:37,741 --> 00:39:39,490
I’ll make more delicious dishes for you.

468
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:41,700
Will do.

469
00:39:42,319 --> 00:39:44,900
We should head off, don't want to be too late.

470
00:39:46,036 --> 00:39:48,531
Gotta go. See you later.

471
00:39:48,531 --> 00:39:49,165
Goodbye.

472
00:39:49,165 --> 00:39:50,873
Safe journey!

473
00:39:50,873 --> 00:39:54,109
Joke, keep an eye on Zo for me, will you?

474
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,297
I got him.

475
00:39:55,653 --> 00:39:57,498
I'll take good care of him.

476
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:00,002
More like I take care of him!

477
00:40:01,029 --> 00:40:03,300
Just look out for each other, okay?

478
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,569
Off you go.

479
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:06,908
- Till next time. Bye!
- Bye.

480
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:21,239
I asked you here today to announce the next president of our club…

481
00:40:29,367 --> 00:40:30,199
Zo!

482
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,668
Give him a round of applause.

483
00:40:43,152 --> 00:40:46,823
He won because of the unanimous votes from all the members.

484
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,260
If you don’t agree, speak now.

485
00:40:53,514 --> 00:40:55,514
Zo, a few words?

486
00:41:02,875 --> 00:41:07,598
Thank you, everyone, for your votes, and your trust.

487
00:41:08,741 --> 00:41:12,041
I promise I'm gonna give this role my all.

488
00:41:12,569 --> 00:41:16,859
I’ll lead us to the nationals and clinch that win.

489
00:41:28,577 --> 00:41:29,505
Guys,

490
00:41:31,826 --> 00:41:34,321
NOVA's got some changes.

491
00:41:37,365 --> 00:41:38,375
Oh?

492
00:41:45,041 --> 00:41:52,380
“Inter-university debate rules update.

493
00:41:52,562 --> 00:41:55,336
Applicants must:

494
00:42:00,526 --> 00:42:03,559
- Be in their fourth year,

495
00:42:09,253 --> 00:42:13,727
since the prize is a post-grad scholarship.

496
00:42:14,278 --> 00:42:22,033
Qualifying students can continue in the competition.”

497
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,920
This means,

498
00:42:27,467 --> 00:42:28,913
Pok, you’re not eligible for this.

499
00:42:32,881 --> 00:42:35,500
Who else here is in their final year of pol-sci?

500
00:42:41,896 --> 00:42:50,204
As your new president, allow me to reveal our debate team for the nationals.

501
00:42:51,473 --> 00:42:52,974
We’ve got…

502
00:42:57,554 --> 00:42:58,365
Zo,

503
00:43:00,098 --> 00:43:00,906
Nita,

504
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:05,340
and Joke.

505
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:06,089
Zo!

506
00:43:06,686 --> 00:43:07,884
Anyone have any reservations?

507
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:09,131
I do!

508
00:43:13,165 --> 00:43:14,180
Everybody, clear out.

509
00:43:26,088 --> 00:43:27,032
You too, Joke.

510
00:43:28,762 --> 00:43:29,818
I'll be outside.

511
00:43:38,541 --> 00:43:39,891
Really? Joke?

512
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:43,589
You said this competition was your dream,

513
00:43:44,359 --> 00:43:47,700
and you’re gonna let Joke ruin it?

514
00:43:48,411 --> 00:43:52,948
I've made that decision because the competition is approaching fast.

515
00:43:54,226 --> 00:43:56,226
He's the only available choice.

516
00:43:56,531 --> 00:44:00,666
Or is it because he's… your special someone?

517
00:44:02,167 --> 00:44:03,931
Who else was there?

518
00:44:04,519 --> 00:44:06,828
He ticks all the boxes.

519
00:44:07,149 --> 00:44:09,335
There are other final year pol-sci students.

520
00:44:09,335 --> 00:44:11,541
You'd rather I pick someone who isn’t even in the club?

521
00:44:13,181 --> 00:44:14,500
Isn't that worse?

522
00:44:16,229 --> 00:44:21,386
I've never liked the guy, and you knew it from day one.

523
00:44:21,558 --> 00:44:22,537
What's so great about Joke?

524
00:44:24,346 --> 00:44:31,235
What’s your deal with him? What did he do that made you hate him?

525
00:44:38,517 --> 00:44:39,658
He’s close with Trin.

526
00:44:52,531 --> 00:44:58,186
Trin was the reason I missed out on the competition during my first year.

527
00:45:07,323 --> 00:45:09,780
Trin, may I?

528
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:13,173
You’ve been acting strange, like someone in love.

529
00:45:16,284 --> 00:45:18,036
Spit it out, what do you want to know?

530
00:45:18,036 --> 00:45:21,462
Okay, okay. Who’s the lucky one?

531
00:45:25,044 --> 00:45:27,044
Everyone’s dying to find out.

532
00:45:29,621 --> 00:45:32,420
Spill, or you're downing your drink.

533
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:36,943
Tell us! Tell us! Tell us!

534
00:45:38,385 --> 00:45:40,478
If I don’t, I drink?

535
00:45:40,478 --> 00:45:41,368
That’s the rule!

536
00:45:46,222 --> 00:45:47,394
We’re listening.

537
00:45:51,617 --> 00:45:52,751
Trin, just spill it.

538
00:45:52,751 --> 00:45:53,911
Out with it, man.

539
00:46:03,966 --> 00:46:06,771
Dude's completely gone. Give me a hand with him?

540
00:46:06,771 --> 00:46:07,759
Up, up.

541
00:46:10,405 --> 00:46:11,700
Did you just lift me up?

542
00:46:12,944 --> 00:46:14,944
Trin, can you handle Wave?

543
00:46:15,219 --> 00:46:16,620
I need to get this one home. He's a goner.

544
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:17,219
I’m not done!

545
00:46:18,443 --> 00:46:20,443
I got this. You guys can go.

546
00:46:20,443 --> 00:46:21,840
Catch you later. Get home safe!

547
00:46:22,455 --> 00:46:25,817
Bye.

548
00:46:33,274 --> 00:46:35,682
Alright, Wave. Time to go.

549
00:46:56,088 --> 00:46:57,129
Let’s go, Wave.

550
00:47:00,489 --> 00:47:02,025
Where to?

551
00:47:02,393 --> 00:47:03,316
More drinks?

552
00:47:03,316 --> 00:47:04,393
No, man.

553
00:47:04,981 --> 00:47:05,929
Let’s go home.

554
00:48:24,506 --> 00:48:25,727
What the hell, man?

555
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:30,220
What’s with you?

556
00:48:31,146 --> 00:48:32,589
That move just now?

557
00:48:33,544 --> 00:48:36,906
I was getting you out of your gross shirt, man. You threw up on it.

558
00:48:40,804 --> 00:48:42,137
Don't play me.

559
00:48:43,034 --> 00:48:44,598
You were trying something.

560
00:48:46,414 --> 00:48:49,033
I see the way you look at me.

561
00:48:52,674 --> 00:48:55,060
Fine, I like you.

562
00:48:56,032 --> 00:48:59,239
But we’re pals. You can’t have feelings for me.

563
00:49:00,244 --> 00:49:01,625
What about those moments when we’re close,

564
00:49:02,393 --> 00:49:06,780
when we’re together, holding hands, sharing rides?

565
00:49:08,321 --> 00:49:11,311
Doesn’t that mean you feel the same?

566
00:49:14,871 --> 00:49:16,190
I’m not into you!

567
00:49:21,318 --> 00:49:24,649
Seriously? A punch, Wave?!

568
00:49:33,151 --> 00:49:37,348
Woah! Break it up!

569
00:49:39,439 --> 00:49:43,203
Shit! Wave, what was that?

570
00:49:43,952 --> 00:49:46,620
Ask him what he did!

571
00:49:47,097 --> 00:49:48,695
I didn’t see him do anything to you.

572
00:49:49,747 --> 00:49:51,685
You think you can compete in this state?

573
00:49:56,656 --> 00:49:57,759
I can.

574
00:49:59,558 --> 00:50:01,620
If you're this riled up now,

575
00:50:02,204 --> 00:50:04,637
how will you handle the heat in the competition?

576
00:50:22,915 --> 00:50:23,851
Did I hurt you?

577
00:50:31,247 --> 00:50:36,272
Look, I can't even begin to understand what you went through.

578
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:40,812
But Joke? He's not Trin.

579
00:50:41,993 --> 00:50:44,488
He's never hurt our club.

580
00:50:49,947 --> 00:50:51,545
No one's really at fault here.

581
00:50:52,624 --> 00:50:54,438
Trin liked you; that's his right.

582
00:50:55,356 --> 00:50:58,315
You not feeling the same? Totally valid.

583
00:50:59,009 --> 00:51:01,257
Joke looking up to Trin as a mentor? That’s his call.

584
00:51:05,701 --> 00:51:10,115
Did you ever stop to think how Trin felt after that punch?

585
00:51:10,744 --> 00:51:12,744
He cost me the competition!

586
00:51:13,235 --> 00:51:14,864
That's on you.

587
00:51:16,005 --> 00:51:19,738
You wouldn't have missed out if you hadn't thrown that punch.

588
00:51:19,738 --> 00:51:20,908
You just don’t get it, Zo.

589
00:51:22,317 --> 00:51:25,493
You’re right,

590
00:51:26,793 --> 00:51:28,495
I wasn’t there.

591
00:51:30,353 --> 00:51:31,734
I was humiliated.

592
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:40,701
But was hitting someone the answer?

593
00:51:44,179 --> 00:51:45,931
I’m not trying to dictate your life here,

594
00:51:47,094 --> 00:51:49,094
I'm speaking to you as someone who looks up to you.

595
00:51:49,978 --> 00:51:52,813
You’ve got issues with Trin? Fine.

596
00:51:54,546 --> 00:51:59,700
But don’t let personal grudges mess with school stuff.

597
00:52:01,095 --> 00:52:02,193
Keep them separate.

598
00:52:14,509 --> 00:52:15,651
I’m sorry.

599
00:52:22,754 --> 00:52:24,754
Save the apology for the one who truly deserves it.

600
00:52:55,425 --> 00:52:57,857
Knowledge is power. Without it,

601
00:52:57,857 --> 00:52:59,860
you won’t earn much.
[Does money hold more weight than knowledge? ]

602
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:03,772
Every earned baht is rooted in knowledge and lived experiences.

603
00:53:03,772 --> 00:53:07,060
Therefore, knowledge means more than money.

604
00:53:08,554 --> 00:53:09,935
I have a different viewpoint.

605
00:53:10,242 --> 00:53:13,340
Money is more important than knowledge.

606
00:53:13,568 --> 00:53:15,980
Money unlocks many doors.

607
00:53:16,128 --> 00:53:19,613
Want to acquire knowledge? Often, it's money that grants you access,

608
00:53:19,654 --> 00:53:22,980
be it investment seminars, advanced language classes,

609
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:25,707
or vocational skills training

610
00:53:26,003 --> 00:53:27,940
Knowledge has a price tag,

611
00:53:27,941 --> 00:53:29,941
which means you need to spend,

612
00:53:30,556 --> 00:53:32,680
and that’s where money plays its part.

613
00:53:34,137 --> 00:53:37,189
With enough money, the world’s your oyster.

614
00:53:37,189 --> 00:53:39,639
You've got yourself so many opportunities.

615
00:53:40,215 --> 00:53:42,122
If you have only knowledge in your pocket,

616
00:53:42,397 --> 00:53:43,871
that’s not going to get you far.

617
00:53:44,550 --> 00:53:47,509
With that, I’m taking this award.

618
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:01,362
As we eagerly anticipate the finals,

619
00:54:01,362 --> 00:54:03,701
let's first reflect on a riveting semi-final round.

620
00:54:04,206 --> 00:54:07,380
Today's central debate: Does money hold more weight than knowledge?

621
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:08,606
Allow me to summarize.

622
00:54:08,915 --> 00:54:11,482
From what we heard today,

623
00:54:11,482 --> 00:54:18,157
both teams presented compelling and thought-provoking arguments that truly gave us something to chew on.

624
00:54:18,578 --> 00:54:23,858
And the winner of this debate is…

625
00:54:28,836 --> 00:54:31,795
the Affirmative team from Bandit Apiwat University!

626
00:54:38,820 --> 00:54:39,768
We did it!

627
00:54:39,768 --> 00:54:41,563
A resounding congratulations to the Affirmative!

628
00:54:41,563 --> 00:54:45,220
And to our Negative team, keep those heads high – your time will surely come.

629
00:55:08,822 --> 00:55:10,048
You can let go now.

630
00:55:16,326 --> 00:55:19,595
You're wound up tight, huh? That's why I haven't let go.

631
00:55:21,576 --> 00:55:23,859
Just want you to know you've got backup.

632
00:55:25,437 --> 00:55:26,640
Me.

633
00:55:28,930 --> 00:55:30,445
Chill a bit, yeah?

634
00:55:31,352 --> 00:55:35,518
The more frazzled you get, the more it gets to me.

635
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:40,594
I’m just scared.

636
00:55:43,286 --> 00:55:44,299
Have a seat.

637
00:55:47,022 --> 00:55:48,017
Come on.

638
00:55:55,501 --> 00:56:00,812
The more you’re stressed and scared, the more weight is on your shoulders.

639
00:56:02,152 --> 00:56:06,071
I know, but I just can’t turn it off.

640
00:56:06,805 --> 00:56:08,341
That’s why I’m sitting here all stressed out.

641
00:56:13,306 --> 00:56:16,389
Here, lay down on my lap.

642
00:56:32,934 --> 00:56:34,004
Feeling better?

643
00:56:36,170 --> 00:56:37,069
I am.

644
00:56:43,970 --> 00:56:47,481
Why are you always there?

645
00:56:50,576 --> 00:56:51,811
Doesn’t it get exhausting?

646
00:56:53,389 --> 00:56:54,327
Not at all.

647
00:56:56,524 --> 00:56:57,945
I love my beau.

648
00:57:07,057 --> 00:57:08,038
Thank you.

649
00:57:13,639 --> 00:57:14,998
Thank you for everything.

650
00:57:34,838 --> 00:57:37,271
Who said you could smooch my hand?

651
00:57:38,675 --> 00:57:39,994
Took the liberty myself.

652
00:57:41,290 --> 00:57:44,559
Didn’t you diplomatically downgrade our relationship?

653
00:57:45,790 --> 00:57:51,070
Well, exceptions can be made

654
00:57:52,850 --> 00:57:59,553
when the foreign policy of the negotiating partner is tempting.

655
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:07,409
Then let’s ramp up our international relations, shall we?

656
00:59:19,547 --> 00:59:22,382
All I want is to make my mom beam with pride.

657
00:59:22,382 --> 00:59:25,305
Why’s this award so high up on your list?

658
00:59:25,821 --> 00:59:28,873
I’m sorry for all this trouble.

659
00:59:29,241 --> 00:59:32,386
In this tough time, you have me next to you.

660
00:59:32,786 --> 00:59:35,700
Remember, I’m always here for you.

661
00:59:37,243 --> 00:59:40,300
In this final leg of the NOVA,

662
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:42,330
the political science debate competition,

663
00:59:42,330 --> 00:59:44,950
the winner is…

664
00:59:47,182 --> 00:59:49,275
Congratulations to…
