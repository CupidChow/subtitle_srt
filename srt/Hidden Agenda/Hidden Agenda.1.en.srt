1
00:00:06,882 --> 00:00:10,857
The boy rabbit's foot landed unexpectedly on a bear trap.

2
00:00:11,169 --> 00:00:15,553
He cried for help until his throat became dry.

3
00:00:15,847 --> 00:00:19,732
Yet nobody rushed to his aid.

4
00:00:20,147 --> 00:00:22,851
The boy rabbit was sitting there hopelessly

5
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:30,419
when the trap was abruptly opened by a sword, saving his life.

6
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:35,706
A beautiful and gracious girl rabbit knight came to his rescue.

7
00:00:36,057 --> 00:00:38,239
After the boy rabbit expressed his gratitude,

8
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:43,557
the girl rabbit merely turned, smiled at him, and walked away.

9
00:00:45,226 --> 00:00:48,384
The boy rabbit met the girl rabbit once again at the tribe

10
00:00:48,732 --> 00:00:50,732
when she was made a tribe member

11
00:00:50,732 --> 00:00:51,373
Hey.

12
00:00:52,008 --> 00:00:54,656
after she slayed a huntsman.

13
00:00:57,459 --> 00:00:58,340
You’re going over time.

14
00:01:03,904 --> 00:01:04,796
I’ll be right back.

15
00:01:18,395 --> 00:01:22,053
Then, the boy rabbit's heart sank

16
00:01:22,388 --> 00:01:25,887
when he learned that she was engaged to someone else.

17
00:01:27,503 --> 00:01:30,548
The boy rabbit continued to watch her from afar.

18
00:01:30,861 --> 00:01:33,156
He kept his feelings inside.

19
00:01:33,266 --> 00:01:36,969
Even after the girl rabbit ended things with her fiancé,

20
00:01:37,275 --> 00:01:40,547
he still did not have the courage to tell her how he felt.

21
00:01:40,761 --> 00:01:42,761
Time went on.

22
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,907
The girl rabbit set out on her journey around the world,

23
00:01:46,161 --> 00:01:51,976
leaving him with no opportunity to finally express his feelings.

24
00:01:51,976 --> 00:01:56,745
The boy rabbit was trapped in his loneliness forever.

25
00:02:11,448 --> 00:02:13,789
Pat, what did you think?

26
00:02:25,995 --> 00:02:26,937
How did you get here?

27
00:02:27,346 --> 00:02:29,267
Where is Pat?

28
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:32,127
I should be the one asking you what you're doing here.

29
00:02:33,855 --> 00:02:35,855
This is the recording studio for musicians.

30
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,910
Outsiders can't just come and use it.

31
00:02:39,334 --> 00:02:39,973
So what?

32
00:02:40,836 --> 00:02:45,000
Is there a sign that says "Only musicians permitted"?

33
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:47,942
Never mind.

34
00:02:49,577 --> 00:02:51,271
You have taken up 5 minutes of my time.

35
00:02:52,921 --> 00:02:57,360
Okay, I'm sorry. I'll pack up and hurry off.

36
00:02:57,513 --> 00:02:58,923
Just wait outside.

37
00:03:00,136 --> 00:03:00,758
No,

38
00:03:02,847 --> 00:03:04,066
I'm staying right here.

39
00:03:05,967 --> 00:03:07,377
I booked the studio.

40
00:03:08,023 --> 00:03:10,023
And you're over by 5 minutes.

41
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:11,728
How would you pay me back?

42
00:03:14,135 --> 00:03:17,520
It's just 5 minutes. It’s not much at all.

43
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,567
Just add 5 minutes to your reserved time.

44
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:26,141
Someone else will be yelling at me the same way I am at you.

45
00:03:27,429 --> 00:03:28,341
What do you want?

46
00:03:30,567 --> 00:03:32,450
I will get back my 5 minutes.

47
00:03:39,202 --> 00:03:40,543
When that time comes,

48
00:03:44,064 --> 00:03:44,924
I'll let you know.

49
00:03:49,557 --> 00:03:50,856
Zo, are you done?

50
00:04:04,886 --> 00:04:06,704
Pat, where have you been?

51
00:04:07,104 --> 00:04:07,947
I went to the toilet.

52
00:04:10,467 --> 00:04:11,624
How did he get in?

53
00:04:13,267 --> 00:04:14,041
He just walked in.

54
00:05:12,096 --> 00:05:15,400
Pat, where are you?

55
00:05:17,253 --> 00:05:17,980
Zo.

56
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,457
Pat, where are you?

57
00:05:19,793 --> 00:05:20,558
Right here.

58
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:21,960
Have you found it?

59
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:22,868
Not yet.

60
00:05:22,868 --> 00:05:23,680
You haven't found it?

61
00:05:23,811 --> 00:05:24,638
I haven't even started to look for it.

62
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,173
Just look for it.

63
00:05:27,043 --> 00:05:28,027
Kot, have you found it?

64
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,248
No.

65
00:05:35,801 --> 00:05:37,323
Shit, I’ve found it.
[Political Science]

66
00:05:38,201 --> 00:05:41,480
Take it with you to the quiz room. We’ll follow.

67
00:05:41,635 --> 00:05:42,516
Okay, see you later.

68
00:05:42,516 --> 00:05:43,440
See you.

69
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:52,632
Are you hurt anywhere, Zo?

70
00:05:56,961 --> 00:05:57,862
Are you okay?

71
00:06:01,677 --> 00:06:04,139
I'm good. Are you hurt, Nita?

72
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:08,450
I'm good, but I need to get going; otherwise, I'll miss the quiz.

73
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:09,926
You should probably head out too.

74
00:06:17,426 --> 00:06:19,744
You’ve been crushing on her

75
00:06:19,744 --> 00:06:22,009
ever since you two entered the Freshy Boy/Girl Contest in freshman year.

76
00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:25,259
The moment you bumped into her today, you just froze.

77
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:25,960
You were stunned.

78
00:06:26,204 --> 00:06:28,386
You’re useless.

79
00:06:28,566 --> 00:06:30,248
Enough, Kot.

80
00:06:31,273 --> 00:06:33,364
Let’s move. We can’t be late for the quiz.

81
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:36,110
This way.

82
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:02,160
And we’re done!

83
00:07:03,302 --> 00:07:06,006
It's not like we've graduated. It was just a quiz. Don’t exaggerate.

84
00:07:06,006 --> 00:07:07,197
But it feels great nonetheless.

85
00:07:07,197 --> 00:07:09,166
I'm starving. When is the bus getting here?

86
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:09,945
Is that our bus?

87
00:07:09,945 --> 00:07:11,606
Yes, it is. That’s the one.

88
00:07:11,606 --> 00:07:12,910
Please stop here.

89
00:07:14,121 --> 00:07:16,121
Come on. Hurry up.

90
00:07:28,834 --> 00:07:31,515
Zo, I think you flunked that quiz, big time.

91
00:07:32,143 --> 00:07:35,278
What? I knew all the answers!

92
00:07:35,278 --> 00:07:38,606
No way you passed. Your eyes weren’t looking at the quiz.

93
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:42,446
They were on Nita the whole time.

94
00:07:42,446 --> 00:07:45,875
You should step up. Grow a pair.

95
00:07:45,995 --> 00:07:50,584
As I’ve told you guys, I’ll deal with this Nita situation my way.

96
00:07:50,584 --> 00:07:51,755
Apparently, it's not working.

97
00:07:51,982 --> 00:07:55,140
It's been years, but you haven't done anything.

98
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:58,209
You've only managed to say "Hello, Nita,"

99
00:07:58,593 --> 00:08:00,000
despite being in the same club!

100
00:08:00,592 --> 00:08:06,316
Listen, if you like Nita, you need to make a move.

101
00:08:06,636 --> 00:08:09,960
We have one year left until we graduate.

102
00:08:10,172 --> 00:08:14,745
It's not that I don't want to. I just don't know how to start.

103
00:08:16,094 --> 00:08:20,888
Start with something small like…

104
00:08:21,436 --> 00:08:26,343
getting her a beverage. You know you’ll see her anyway.

105
00:08:27,324 --> 00:08:29,000
Or…

106
00:08:31,993 --> 00:08:32,630
Joke.

107
00:08:32,925 --> 00:08:34,038
Do you remember Joke?

108
00:08:34,498 --> 00:08:35,140
Joke?

109
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,280
Yes, Joke.

110
00:08:36,486 --> 00:08:37,511
Joke So Cool?

111
00:08:37,647 --> 00:08:38,849
♪ A Toast ♪

112
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:39,669
What would you do with that?

113
00:08:40,582 --> 00:08:42,082
No, Joke from Public Administration.

114
00:08:42,324 --> 00:08:44,574
Oh, that Joke.

115
00:08:44,574 --> 00:08:47,901
You left me with him yesterday.

116
00:08:47,901 --> 00:08:48,983
Don't even mention him to me.

117
00:08:50,094 --> 00:08:52,320
Joke used to date Nita.

118
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,943
Maybe he can help you out.

119
00:08:54,331 --> 00:08:57,035
Are you nuts? How's that going to work?

120
00:08:57,035 --> 00:08:58,411
You can learn things about her.

121
00:08:58,411 --> 00:09:00,104
Who would know Nita better than him?

122
00:09:00,104 --> 00:09:01,428
He went out with her.

123
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:06,600
So, you’re saying I should ask Joke to help me win over his ex?

124
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,253
Yeah.

125
00:09:07,253 --> 00:09:08,641
Would you do it if it were you?

126
00:09:11,766 --> 00:09:14,697
Pat, one thing you should know. Joke and I…

127
00:09:15,001 --> 00:09:19,640
Hold on, asking Joke for help with this?

128
00:09:19,906 --> 00:09:21,543
He’s foul-mouthed as hell.

129
00:09:22,965 --> 00:09:26,200
Zo, listen to me. Don’t listen to Pat.

130
00:09:26,363 --> 00:09:29,657
And you… stop giving crazy advice.

131
00:09:29,657 --> 00:09:32,464
We’re getting off at the next stop. Let’s go.

132
00:09:32,464 --> 00:09:33,886
Unbelievable.

133
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:36,383
Zo, catch you later.

134
00:09:36,383 --> 00:09:37,268
See you.

135
00:09:37,268 --> 00:09:38,699
Bye

136
00:09:39,075 --> 00:09:39,767
Bye

137
00:09:40,335 --> 00:09:41,602
Let’s roll.

138
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:46,219
Later.

139
00:09:46,637 --> 00:09:47,520
Later.

140
00:10:05,045 --> 00:10:06,841
What are you doing?

141
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:12,603
You like Nita?

142
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,092
How did you know?

143
00:10:20,569 --> 00:10:22,744
Were you eavesdropping?

144
00:10:23,963 --> 00:10:25,781
Right, you all talked very softly.

145
00:10:26,966 --> 00:10:28,341
I just happened to overhear.

146
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,807
I wasn't trying to eavesdrop.

147
00:10:33,731 --> 00:10:38,184
Well, regardless, who I like is my own business.

148
00:10:39,434 --> 00:10:41,366
It's not like you're dating her.

149
00:10:43,464 --> 00:10:44,176
No.

150
00:10:45,464 --> 00:10:49,341
Just didn't think you were the type to go for someone like Nita.

151
00:10:58,773 --> 00:11:00,542
Your friend mentioned you needed my advice.

152
00:11:01,859 --> 00:11:03,203
What do you need help with?

153
00:11:21,658 --> 00:11:22,579
I’m good.

154
00:11:23,033 --> 00:11:25,400
I can handle my own business.

155
00:11:44,271 --> 00:11:45,955
Umm…

156
00:11:46,221 --> 00:11:48,360
An iced coffee, please.

157
00:11:54,712 --> 00:11:55,569
Who is that for?

158
00:11:57,986 --> 00:12:00,420
For me. Why?

159
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:03,776
Do you even like coffee?

160
00:12:07,013 --> 00:12:07,865
I need something to keep me awake.

161
00:12:09,928 --> 00:12:11,928
Nita doesn’t like coffee.

162
00:12:13,245 --> 00:12:14,569
But I do like roselle juice.

163
00:12:15,454 --> 00:12:21,367
How about you buy me one and beg me for my help?

164
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,092
None of your business!

165
00:12:49,855 --> 00:12:50,892
Oh, hello.

166
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:04,010
I could give it a try after this.

167
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:06,935
They open until late. You can check it out.

168
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:08,464
Okay.

169
00:13:19,795 --> 00:13:20,484
Zo!

170
00:13:20,484 --> 00:13:22,889
Shit!

171
00:13:25,056 --> 00:13:26,809
You’re going to get us in trouble with Wave.

172
00:13:26,809 --> 00:13:28,647
Why did you freak out like that?

173
00:13:29,026 --> 00:13:32,235
You came up to me without warning.

174
00:13:32,949 --> 00:13:35,625
Look, my coffee!

175
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:40,157
Screw the coffee, look at these.

176
00:13:42,539 --> 00:13:43,315
Oh man,

177
00:13:45,445 --> 00:13:46,669
I’m so sorry.

178
00:13:46,669 --> 00:13:48,499
I'll get new printouts right away.

179
00:13:48,499 --> 00:13:48,999
ASAP, please.

180
00:13:48,999 --> 00:13:50,537
Sure, I’ll get right on it.

181
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:52,225
Damn!

182
00:13:55,545 --> 00:13:56,251
Pok!

183
00:13:58,566 --> 00:13:59,512
Where are my posters?

184
00:14:00,136 --> 00:14:01,248
Zo, the posters.

185
00:14:01,248 --> 00:14:03,427
The posters, right.

186
00:14:05,505 --> 00:14:09,205
Pok has all the printouts.

187
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:12,133
There’s just a tiny hiccup.

188
00:14:12,133 --> 00:14:13,479
So tiny.

189
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:19,209
I accidentally spilled coffee all over the posters.

190
00:14:21,499 --> 00:14:23,745
But I’m going to reprint them right now.

191
00:14:29,533 --> 00:14:32,475
You’d better do that before I call a meeting.

192
00:14:39,885 --> 00:14:40,733
[Club Announcement]

193
00:14:40,733 --> 00:14:43,524
The national inter-university debate competition

194
00:14:43,712 --> 00:14:46,593
of the political science faculty, or NOVA, is here.

195
00:14:47,314 --> 00:14:51,076
As you know, our club has lost three years in a row.

196
00:14:51,511 --> 00:14:56,809
We are counting on you guys to bring back some glory to our club this year.

197
00:14:56,936 --> 00:15:00,054
We have three members from the Political Science Faculty.

198
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:02,678
You will surely be in this competition.

199
00:15:03,122 --> 00:15:05,369
But don’t sweat it. You have everyone’s support.

200
00:15:05,369 --> 00:15:08,123
Just do your best for the sake of our club.

201
00:15:08,873 --> 00:15:09,685
Wave.

202
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:14,403
I'm curious about the details of the application.

203
00:15:14,797 --> 00:15:16,367
Have we received the application form?

204
00:15:16,367 --> 00:15:20,213
And is the competition going to be run the same way as last year?

205
00:15:20,213 --> 00:15:20,770
Also, our practice...

206
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:22,854
Whoa, slow down.

207
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:25,049
I know you're taking this very seriously.

208
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,374
But we've only just announced this.

209
00:15:26,556 --> 00:15:28,966
I'll keep you updated as I get more info.

210
00:15:30,238 --> 00:15:33,774
That's it for now - I'll send out more details as they come.

211
00:15:35,249 --> 00:15:35,999
All right.

212
00:15:43,947 --> 00:15:46,582
Hang in there, this year's going to be a real challenge, I think.

213
00:15:48,236 --> 00:15:49,066
You too.

214
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:55,418
Want to go grab something to eat?

215
00:15:57,882 --> 00:15:59,053
I already have plans.

216
00:15:59,627 --> 00:16:01,214
You never have time for me.

217
00:16:03,502 --> 00:16:04,474
I have to go. Bye.

218
00:16:10,353 --> 00:16:11,545
We should hang out sometime.

219
00:16:33,992 --> 00:16:35,992
Let’s knock 'em dead together.

220
00:16:37,928 --> 00:16:39,785
Absolutely.

221
00:17:43,351 --> 00:17:44,921
You can barely bring yourself to walk past her,

222
00:17:46,353 --> 00:17:47,861
and yet you want to chase after her?

223
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:54,341
Hey, Nita.

224
00:18:09,369 --> 00:18:10,065
Hey,

225
00:18:11,581 --> 00:18:14,974
about your advice on buying Nita a drink...

226
00:18:14,974 --> 00:18:16,301
I don't think that's going to work out.

227
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:18,902
Got any other tips?

228
00:18:20,478 --> 00:18:23,755
It just feels wrong to be giving her stuff already.

229
00:18:23,756 --> 00:18:24,774
Zo, seriously?

230
00:18:24,774 --> 00:18:27,969
You're going to follow his advice on pursuing Nita?

231
00:18:27,969 --> 00:18:31,589
What’s wrong with my advice?

232
00:18:32,265 --> 00:18:33,169
Zip it.

233
00:18:37,102 --> 00:18:39,652
I've learned from my experience chasing Manao in freshman year.

234
00:18:40,118 --> 00:18:42,849
Girls like guys who take care of them.

235
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:47,569
Help her out with the little things when you get a chance.

236
00:18:48,273 --> 00:18:50,273
You might just impress her.

237
00:18:54,228 --> 00:18:55,031
Yeah,

238
00:18:56,506 --> 00:18:57,929
that actually sounds pretty good.

239
00:18:58,279 --> 00:18:59,931
You sound like someone who’s dated 10 girls.

240
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:01,485
Too many.

241
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:02,929
Don’t take him too seriously.

242
00:19:05,607 --> 00:19:06,767
How about we get back to studying?

243
00:19:18,619 --> 00:19:20,004
Kot, what do you make of this?

244
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:24,140
I think it either…

245
00:19:27,491 --> 00:19:31,150
I’ll drop the documents off with the teacher. Catch you later.

246
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:32,115
I’ll wait for you at the canteen.

247
00:19:32,115 --> 00:19:33,490
This is your chance.

248
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:35,615
No, I can't. Not right now.

249
00:19:35,615 --> 00:19:36,553
Now is the right time. Trust me.

250
00:19:36,553 --> 00:19:37,629
I'm not ready.

251
00:19:37,629 --> 00:19:39,509
Just go!

252
00:19:47,156 --> 00:19:50,129
Nita, need a hand with that bag?

253
00:19:50,933 --> 00:19:53,773
No, I got it, Zo. Just taking this down to the teacher.

254
00:19:54,892 --> 00:19:57,097
Let me help.

255
00:19:58,121 --> 00:19:58,786
I’m good.

256
00:19:58,786 --> 00:20:00,408
Trust me, it’s heavy, Nita.

257
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:02,462
- I’m fine, really.
- Nita, this is heavy. Let me take it.

258
00:20:02,462 --> 00:20:03,144
There’s no need.

259
00:20:03,144 --> 00:20:04,454
Please, let me help.

260
00:20:18,886 --> 00:20:21,685
I’m really sorry. I didn’t mean for this to happen.

261
00:20:21,889 --> 00:20:23,029
It's all good, really.

262
00:20:23,933 --> 00:20:24,673
Hand it over.

263
00:20:29,815 --> 00:20:30,870
I got this.

264
00:20:34,849 --> 00:20:35,538
Thanks.

265
00:20:52,934 --> 00:20:53,850
You okay, Zo?

266
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:58,743
I don't get it. Why is it that this jerk always shows up when I'm with Nita?

267
00:21:10,165 --> 00:21:12,313
Don't tag me in that. I don't want my mom to see.

268
00:21:13,484 --> 00:21:14,294
Fine.

269
00:21:15,164 --> 00:21:19,369
Zo, has your mom come up to visit lately?

270
00:21:21,081 --> 00:21:22,355
Not for a while.

271
00:21:23,129 --> 00:21:25,340
She’s been busy.

272
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:31,680
Kot, look at your friend.

273
00:21:32,235 --> 00:21:33,938
He's giving us those sad puppy-dog eyes.

274
00:21:34,431 --> 00:21:37,831
I told you, asking Joke for help is the best move.

275
00:21:38,681 --> 00:21:39,368
You and your plans.

276
00:21:42,019 --> 00:21:43,529
I can’t stand that guy.

277
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:44,555
Joke?

278
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,609
Or you.

279
00:21:45,806 --> 00:21:47,027
I’m not a fan either in that case.

280
00:21:47,027 --> 00:21:47,912
Of course, I meant Joke.

281
00:21:48,463 --> 00:21:49,619
I’m not sure,

282
00:21:50,616 --> 00:21:52,181
he might have a problem with me.

283
00:21:52,432 --> 00:21:53,427
Or maybe it’s all in your head?

284
00:21:54,276 --> 00:21:55,705
He's probably just a bit rough around the edges.

285
00:21:56,196 --> 00:21:57,036
Let’s drink.

286
00:21:58,089 --> 00:22:01,879
Pat, Zo is my friend. Don’t butt in.

287
00:22:01,879 --> 00:22:03,386
I'm perfectly capable of helping out a friend.

288
00:22:03,386 --> 00:22:06,485
Really? And what exactly have you helped him with?

289
00:22:06,485 --> 00:22:07,377
Look at him.

290
00:22:08,265 --> 00:22:09,671
This situation is beyond our help.

291
00:22:09,897 --> 00:22:13,446
As I've said, the person who knows Nita best is Joke.

292
00:22:13,876 --> 00:22:14,890
He can help.

293
00:22:15,526 --> 00:22:16,173
Trust me.

294
00:22:16,814 --> 00:22:17,796
I'd rather not.

295
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,121
Hey, look, Joke's here.

296
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:24,933
Perfect timing. Ask him.

297
00:22:26,181 --> 00:22:27,248
Are you out of your mind?

298
00:22:28,129 --> 00:22:30,999
Pat, stop. Don't stir the pot.

299
00:22:34,738 --> 00:22:36,123
Sure is crowded today.

300
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:37,762
It’s pretty typical.

301
00:22:38,129 --> 00:22:40,294
Are you almost on?

302
00:22:40,687 --> 00:22:41,651
Hello there.

303
00:22:42,415 --> 00:22:43,281
Hi.

304
00:22:43,427 --> 00:22:44,215
How long have you been here?

305
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:45,289
Just got here.

306
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:48,265
Man, Nita is here.

307
00:22:50,395 --> 00:22:51,716
They're sitting at the same table.

308
00:22:52,315 --> 00:22:55,418
Are they getting back together?

309
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:01,414
Let me ask them.

310
00:23:01,647 --> 00:23:03,129
No!

311
00:23:04,705 --> 00:23:05,772
Don't you want to know?

312
00:23:06,074 --> 00:23:07,027
I don’t care anymore.

313
00:23:07,812 --> 00:23:08,859
You can’t just ask!

314
00:23:14,335 --> 00:23:15,639
It’s been a while since we last drank together.

315
00:23:15,729 --> 00:23:16,425
True.

316
00:23:18,758 --> 00:23:19,689
Trin, hello.

317
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:20,758
Hi.

318
00:23:22,339 --> 00:23:24,657
Your bar is as crowded as ever.

319
00:23:25,139 --> 00:23:26,046
You must be raking it in.

320
00:23:26,533 --> 00:23:27,626
Drinks on you tonight?

321
00:23:29,176 --> 00:23:31,770
We don’t need to come to that.

322
00:23:32,052 --> 00:23:35,197
Why don't you take it out of Joke's pay?

323
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,073
Do they pay good money for part-time work here?

324
00:23:40,926 --> 00:23:42,820
Maybe I should get a job.

325
00:23:43,757 --> 00:23:44,750
Can you sing?

326
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:48,169
Of course. I’m a good singer, actually.

327
00:23:48,895 --> 00:23:52,168
Enjoy your night out. I’ll give you a discount.

328
00:23:52,168 --> 00:23:53,193
Family discount.

329
00:23:53,429 --> 00:23:56,065
If we’re family, all drinks would be free, wouldn’t they?

330
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,467
Just kidding.

331
00:23:59,414 --> 00:24:01,902
Joke, go get ready. It’s almost time.

332
00:24:02,177 --> 00:24:02,892
All right.

333
00:24:03,889 --> 00:24:04,750
I’ll be right back.

334
00:24:05,407 --> 00:24:06,691
I wasn’t kidding about working here.

335
00:24:07,009 --> 00:24:08,129
I can sing.

336
00:24:08,931 --> 00:24:10,528
You can go on after Joke.

337
00:24:10,528 --> 00:24:11,642
We’ll see about that.

338
00:24:11,642 --> 00:24:12,329
Sure.

339
00:24:20,411 --> 00:24:21,167
Joke!

340
00:24:25,176 --> 00:24:26,886
I know you two are curious.

341
00:24:27,108 --> 00:24:29,447
Why not let me ask and put it to rest?

342
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:32,603
What are you curious about?

343
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:37,269
We're wondering what's the deal between you and Nita.

344
00:24:40,022 --> 00:24:42,289
All of you or just one of you wants to know?

345
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:47,849
Quit beating around the bush. Just answer.

346
00:24:48,882 --> 00:24:49,705
I’m not answering.

347
00:24:50,257 --> 00:24:51,369
Why should I?

348
00:24:51,725 --> 00:24:52,620
Playing coy?

349
00:24:52,981 --> 00:24:54,447
Don’t stand in the way.

350
00:25:02,671 --> 00:25:05,816
If you were so curious, why didn't you ask me yourself?

351
00:25:07,152 --> 00:25:10,049
Getting a friend to do your dirty work? You have no spine.

352
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:12,475
Asshole!

353
00:25:12,475 --> 00:25:14,266
Calm down! Zo! Zo!

354
00:25:14,732 --> 00:25:15,526
Sit down.

355
00:25:15,526 --> 00:25:16,435
Zo, sit down!

356
00:25:16,708 --> 00:25:17,419
Zo,

357
00:25:19,816 --> 00:25:21,423
sit down!

358
00:25:34,962 --> 00:25:35,587
Zo,

359
00:25:36,436 --> 00:25:37,811
take it easy, man.

360
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,115
I don't want to drag your sorry ass back to the dorm.

361
00:25:40,115 --> 00:25:40,943
Yeah.

362
00:25:42,128 --> 00:25:42,946
I’m good.

363
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,155
I doubt that.

364
00:26:01,451 --> 00:26:03,621
Anyone here have a crush on someone,

365
00:26:04,667 --> 00:26:06,364
but can't seem to muster the courage to make a move?

366
00:26:06,672 --> 00:26:07,720
My friend here.

367
00:26:08,299 --> 00:26:09,969
If you like them, tell them.

368
00:26:09,969 --> 00:26:12,424
A brave person moves forward.

369
00:26:12,424 --> 00:26:13,453
Don't be a wuss.

370
00:26:13,453 --> 00:26:17,879
Yeah! Tell them!

371
00:26:19,481 --> 00:26:23,878
This next song goes out to all you secret admirers out there.

372
00:26:26,631 --> 00:26:28,016
Hope you get what you want.

373
00:26:36,285 --> 00:26:42,018
♪ Because I feel too much for you ♪

374
00:26:42,725 --> 00:26:51,428
♪ I feel for you with all my heart, but I know it's impossible ♪

375
00:26:53,275 --> 00:27:00,960

376
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:08,688
♪ I want to be that person, the one who gets to have you by their side ♪

377
00:27:08,889 --> 00:27:17,189
♪ I want to do everything to make you turn and pay attention ♪

378
00:27:17,492 --> 00:27:25,050

379
00:27:25,318 --> 00:27:29,185

380
00:27:39,702 --> 00:27:40,525
Thank you.

381
00:27:54,864 --> 00:27:55,594
Zo!

382
00:27:57,694 --> 00:27:58,683
Are you okay?

383
00:27:59,329 --> 00:28:00,271
Where are your friends?

384
00:28:00,526 --> 00:28:02,390
Let me go. I'm good.

385
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,000
Zo!

386
00:28:03,588 --> 00:28:04,597
Leave me alone!

387
00:28:04,745 --> 00:28:05,736
Come here.

388
00:28:06,417 --> 00:28:07,050
Zo!

389
00:28:07,326 --> 00:28:08,129
Leave me alone!

390
00:28:09,578 --> 00:28:10,263
Zo!

391
00:28:40,422 --> 00:28:41,202
You!

392
00:28:41,796 --> 00:28:43,992
What's your beef with me?

393
00:28:44,258 --> 00:28:45,091
What are you talking about?

394
00:28:45,367 --> 00:28:46,643
Back at the bar,

395
00:28:49,379 --> 00:28:51,540
you were definitely digging at me, weren't you?

396
00:28:52,874 --> 00:28:54,874
Why can't you stop poking fun at me about Nita?

397
00:28:55,929 --> 00:28:56,601
What did I supposedly tease you about?

398
00:28:59,401 --> 00:29:00,984
I know you meant it.

399
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:04,625
You don’t want me anywhere near Nita.

400
00:29:06,763 --> 00:29:08,129
You’re trying to block me.

401
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,722
Are you getting back together with her?

402
00:29:14,109 --> 00:29:17,806
If you don't want me chasing after Nita, just tell me straight.

403
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,158
Zo, Zo…

404
00:29:19,158 --> 00:29:21,049
Stop messing with me.

405
00:29:21,405 --> 00:29:22,791
You're not making much sense when you're drunk.

406
00:29:23,894 --> 00:29:24,687
Yeah,

407
00:29:25,887 --> 00:29:27,681
I'm taking nonsense.

408
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:30,737
I'm a loser.

409
00:29:31,887 --> 00:29:37,642
I'm not this attractive, cool guy who has people flocking to him like you.

410
00:29:42,477 --> 00:29:47,256
When I finally found the guts to make a move, I messed up.

411
00:29:48,133 --> 00:29:50,133
And then you just had to rub salt in my wounds.

412
00:29:53,643 --> 00:29:54,331
Zo!

413
00:29:55,031 --> 00:29:55,940
Let me go!

414
00:29:56,143 --> 00:29:56,861
Zo, stop it!

415
00:29:56,861 --> 00:29:57,634
Let me go!

416
00:29:57,634 --> 00:29:59,516
- Zo!
- Let me go!

417
00:30:01,325 --> 00:30:02,580
Listen to me!

418
00:30:02,835 --> 00:30:03,665
Zo!

419
00:30:04,895 --> 00:30:05,752
Hear me out!

420
00:30:08,904 --> 00:30:10,543
I’m taking those 5 minutes now.

421
00:30:10,951 --> 00:30:12,654
Remember what you promised?

422
00:30:15,798 --> 00:30:16,865
I’m not keeping Nita away from you.

423
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:20,837
We're not getting back together.

424
00:30:23,734 --> 00:30:27,346
What I said on stage was not about you and Nita.

425
00:30:31,147 --> 00:30:34,908
And this rubbing salt on your wounds thing—what exactly did I do?

426
00:30:35,841 --> 00:30:36,992
What did I do that hurt you?

427
00:30:37,489 --> 00:30:39,319
If you think you don't stand a chance with Nita,

428
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:43,969
just give up.

429
00:30:45,235 --> 00:30:46,386
You asshole!

430
00:31:28,857 --> 00:31:30,415
Are you still feeling the hangover?

431
00:31:35,781 --> 00:31:36,692
Looks like he's still dealing with the aftermath.

432
00:31:36,692 --> 00:31:37,356
Absolutely.

433
00:31:37,699 --> 00:31:38,700
Without a doubt.

434
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,549
Look at his eyes. He hasn’t blinked once.

435
00:31:41,779 --> 00:31:44,215
I told you, Kot, not to let him drink too much.

436
00:31:44,215 --> 00:31:45,635
Don't put this on me. It's on you.

437
00:31:45,635 --> 00:31:48,297
I saw you continually passing him drinks. I had to step in.

438
00:31:48,297 --> 00:31:49,411
Well, he kept asking for more.

439
00:31:49,411 --> 00:31:52,349
Look at the consequences of what you did last night.

440
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:54,816
Guys!

441
00:31:57,530 --> 00:31:58,807
Last night…

442
00:32:00,889 --> 00:32:02,166
I punched Joke right in the face.

443
00:32:02,377 --> 00:32:03,233
What?!

444
00:32:04,128 --> 00:32:05,278
Are you serious?

445
00:32:05,383 --> 00:32:06,071
yes

446
00:32:06,464 --> 00:32:07,867
Why on earth would you do that?

447
00:32:09,314 --> 00:32:13,317
It's his constant teasing about Nita.

448
00:32:14,502 --> 00:32:16,775
Did you catch his song last night?

449
00:32:16,775 --> 00:32:18,499
Yeah, I heard him sing.

450
00:32:18,896 --> 00:32:21,133
But he was performing requests from the crowd.

451
00:32:21,642 --> 00:32:22,614
You might have overreacted just a bit.

452
00:32:23,642 --> 00:32:24,670
But he…

453
00:32:25,659 --> 00:32:28,397
I'm blaming the booze. You were hammered.

454
00:32:28,896 --> 00:32:31,924
You're not usually like this, Zo.

455
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:37,967
I'm siding with Pat this time, even though Joke can be an ass.

456
00:32:40,081 --> 00:32:40,959
You’re right.

457
00:32:43,199 --> 00:32:45,895
What should I do now?

458
00:32:45,895 --> 00:32:47,627
I think you owe him an apology.

459
00:32:48,272 --> 00:32:49,850
He might not even be angry.

460
00:32:51,053 --> 00:32:53,053
We can come with you if you want.

461
00:32:56,533 --> 00:32:57,383
No,

462
00:32:58,701 --> 00:32:59,881
it’s on me.

463
00:33:01,093 --> 00:33:02,235
I’ll go apologize.

464
00:33:05,766 --> 00:33:08,104
If he gets aggressive, give us a call.

465
00:33:08,104 --> 00:33:09,983
One ring, and we’ll come running.

466
00:33:12,439 --> 00:33:14,439
I never thought I’d see the day Zo punched someone.

467
00:33:16,065 --> 00:33:16,704
Badass.

468
00:33:16,836 --> 00:33:18,197
Let’s eat.

469
00:33:40,259 --> 00:33:41,020
Why are you here?

470
00:33:42,997 --> 00:33:44,236
To throw another punch my way?

471
00:33:47,918 --> 00:33:48,856
No.

472
00:33:52,546 --> 00:33:54,425
I came to apologize for yesterday.

473
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,557
I may have overreacted a bit.

474
00:33:59,436 --> 00:34:00,461
Oh, really?

475
00:34:02,393 --> 00:34:03,582
What if I don't forgive you?

476
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,686
I'm sorry.

477
00:34:09,503 --> 00:34:11,033
I'm really sorry.

478
00:34:15,669 --> 00:34:17,116
You punched me in the face, Zo.

479
00:34:19,012 --> 00:34:23,094
Do you think a mere apology will make everything okay

480
00:34:23,501 --> 00:34:24,842
and earn you my forgiveness?

481
00:34:40,447 --> 00:34:41,742
Hey,

482
00:34:44,667 --> 00:34:45,899
where are you going?

483
00:34:57,276 --> 00:34:58,268
Why are you following me?

484
00:34:59,276 --> 00:35:00,615
Where are you headed?

485
00:35:00,615 --> 00:35:01,872
Where I'm going is not your concern.

486
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:04,695
And I'm not forgiving you.

487
00:35:06,864 --> 00:35:08,244
I'm apologizing here.

488
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:10,498
What do you want me to do? Tell me.

489
00:35:13,495 --> 00:35:15,495
Fine, you can hit me back

490
00:35:19,767 --> 00:35:20,669
Have at it.

491
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:23,638
Why should I hurt my hand by punching you?

492
00:35:25,136 --> 00:35:26,437
Punch yourself in the face.

493
00:35:30,548 --> 00:35:31,488
Sure.

494
00:35:32,437 --> 00:35:34,415
I'll punch myself in the face.

495
00:35:34,914 --> 00:35:35,801
Great!

496
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,205
Just make sure it’s as hard as the one you landed on me.

497
00:35:38,706 --> 00:35:39,656
Go for it.

498
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:17,446
I've changed my mind.

499
00:36:19,133 --> 00:36:20,365
You don't need to do this.

500
00:36:29,275 --> 00:36:31,723
So, you've forgiven me, then.

501
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:35,911
Not exactly.

502
00:36:37,176 --> 00:36:38,455
What do you mean?

503
00:36:38,771 --> 00:36:39,982
I'm going to the recording studio.

504
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,511
You’re welcome to join me if you want.

505
00:36:49,276 --> 00:36:50,327
[What’s his deal?]

506
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:09,008
Have a seat.

507
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:20,945
Here.

508
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:24,124
This is for you.

509
00:37:28,317 --> 00:37:30,575
Does it still hurt?

510
00:37:37,607 --> 00:37:38,474
I'm fine.

511
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:43,683
Joke, are you still mad at me?

512
00:38:04,629 --> 00:38:06,215
Let me take care of your wound.

513
00:38:06,488 --> 00:38:08,277
That’s not necessary.

514
00:38:08,277 --> 00:38:10,197
Stay still. Let me do it.

515
00:38:10,803 --> 00:38:16,466
If you just leave it as it is, it won't heal quickly,

516
00:38:16,737 --> 00:38:18,605
and I'll have to see it.

517
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:20,464
Every time I see it, I will feel bad.

518
00:38:24,711 --> 00:38:27,159
Come on. Let me do it.

519
00:38:49,462 --> 00:38:50,196
Joke.

520
00:38:54,044 --> 00:38:55,310
I’m truly sorry.

521
00:38:56,029 --> 00:38:58,293
Joke, you’re here!

522
00:38:58,293 --> 00:39:00,353
The seniors tasked me with admin stuff.

523
00:39:01,308 --> 00:39:04,863
Thanks, man, for stepping in for me in the contest.

524
00:39:05,307 --> 00:39:06,322
You make my life even more difficult.

525
00:39:07,771 --> 00:39:12,235
I thought you didn’t want to enter the contest.

526
00:39:12,235 --> 00:39:13,766
I don’t want to do anything.

527
00:39:14,069 --> 00:39:16,069
And I don’t want you to be all up in my business.

528
00:39:18,222 --> 00:39:20,695
Let me ask you something. What was going through your mind?

529
00:39:20,823 --> 00:39:22,322
Why would you offer to take my place in the contest?

530
00:39:23,004 --> 00:39:24,194
Because I get you.

531
00:39:25,459 --> 00:39:26,796
I knew you didn't want to do it.

532
00:39:27,352 --> 00:39:28,895
I'm helping you here.

533
00:39:29,208 --> 00:39:30,628
Oh, you're helping me.

534
00:39:31,309 --> 00:39:34,735
What you did and what you got in return—was it all worth it?

535
00:39:34,735 --> 00:39:38,788
What you said on stage wouldn’t change this broken system.

536
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,580
Stop this nonsense.

537
00:39:46,233 --> 00:39:48,184
If you hate this so much,

538
00:39:50,575 --> 00:39:52,294
why are you still doing this admin task?

539
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:54,419
I have my reasons.

540
00:39:55,772 --> 00:39:59,935
I know you don't like me very much.

541
00:40:01,175 --> 00:40:04,862
When stuff like this happens, it’s hard to change your perception.

542
00:40:07,824 --> 00:40:11,537
But I don’t want any bad blood between us.

543
00:40:12,433 --> 00:40:14,011
Who said I don’t like you?

544
00:40:16,382 --> 00:40:19,805
You repeatedly gave me harsh words during our freshman year.

545
00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:21,839
I just didn’t know what to say.

546
00:40:23,358 --> 00:40:24,615
So I said all that terrible stuff.

547
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:25,704
Huh?

548
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:27,817
For what?

549
00:40:28,682 --> 00:40:29,641
Fine,

550
00:40:30,168 --> 00:40:31,473
I’ve forgiven you.

551
00:40:32,375 --> 00:40:36,351
Let's call it even for all those times I was a jerk to you.

552
00:40:55,247 --> 00:40:56,384
I got this for you.

553
00:41:02,577 --> 00:41:03,521
You remember.

554
00:41:05,656 --> 00:41:06,609
Quite observant.

555
00:41:09,034 --> 00:41:10,662
I just want to make things right.

556
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:22,838
Joke.

557
00:41:27,994 --> 00:41:29,546
I have a question.

558
00:41:33,383 --> 00:41:40,335
You mentioned last night that you and Nita aren’t getting back together.

559
00:41:42,221 --> 00:41:47,173
Why are you two still hanging out?

560
00:41:48,765 --> 00:41:50,422
You can still be friends with someone after breaking up.

561
00:41:51,914 --> 00:41:52,759
Friends…

562
00:41:53,312 --> 00:41:54,203
so you guys are just friends.

563
00:41:54,577 --> 00:41:57,816
It means you're not in a relationship or anything.

564
00:42:00,081 --> 00:42:02,469
We're just friends, nothing more.

565
00:42:03,444 --> 00:42:05,099
Is that what you’d like to hear?

566
00:42:10,975 --> 00:42:19,455
If that’s the case, can you please help me win Nita over?

567
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:30,516
Joke, just listen.

568
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:38,380
I didn’t dare ask you directly because I knew you guys dated.

569
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:42,113
But you’ve just said that you two are friends,

570
00:42:42,719 --> 00:42:47,987
so I’m asking for your help.

571
00:42:49,482 --> 00:42:54,053
But if you’re not comfortable, you don’t need to say yes.

572
00:42:55,799 --> 00:42:57,175
You really like Nita, huh?

573
00:43:02,314 --> 00:43:03,321
Have you ever pursued anyone before?

574
00:43:10,091 --> 00:43:13,277
I will teach you how to do that.

575
00:43:15,209 --> 00:43:19,686
But first of all, let’s make a secret pact.

576
00:43:22,465 --> 00:43:24,465
You drink half, I drink half.

577
00:43:27,209 --> 00:43:28,413
Roselle juice?

578
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:32,090
Yes, like in those old Chinese movies.

579
00:43:34,588 --> 00:43:36,272
You’re acting like a child.

580
00:43:37,041 --> 00:43:38,895
I don’t like roselle juice.

581
00:43:39,115 --> 00:43:40,085
But I do.

582
00:43:40,401 --> 00:43:44,295
If you drink this, it signifies that you accept me as your mentor.

583
00:43:44,295 --> 00:43:45,768
And then I'll help you.

584
00:43:57,812 --> 00:43:58,935
Last chance.

585
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:16,853
Bottoms up.

586
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:19,341
Half-half.

587
00:44:23,113 --> 00:44:24,027
Ew!

588
00:44:26,847 --> 00:44:27,855
Do we have a deal?

589
00:44:30,532 --> 00:44:31,295
We have a deal.

590
00:44:33,043 --> 00:44:35,043
But I won’t do this for free.

591
00:44:35,474 --> 00:44:36,523
Does this mean

592
00:44:37,814 --> 00:44:39,135
you will charge me?

593
00:44:40,707 --> 00:44:41,471
No.

594
00:44:43,895 --> 00:44:45,131
But I want to join

595
00:44:47,831 --> 00:44:49,059
the debate club.

596
00:44:50,456 --> 00:44:52,282
The debate club?

597
00:44:54,201 --> 00:44:54,963
Why?

598
00:44:57,308 --> 00:44:58,678
So I can be near you.

599
00:45:20,976 --> 00:45:23,688
You will debate in front of Wave.

600
00:45:23,688 --> 00:45:27,237
When you speak, look straight. Don’t just look at me.

601
00:45:27,735 --> 00:45:29,023
Is he Wave’s mentee?

602
00:45:29,307 --> 00:45:30,935
I didn’t know you guys were close.

603
00:45:30,935 --> 00:45:32,620
But be careful of those guys.

604
00:45:33,558 --> 00:45:36,375
If anything happens to you, who’s going to help me with Nita?

605
00:45:36,375 --> 00:45:37,789
Who would you like me to debate against?

606
00:45:37,789 --> 00:45:42,563
Against Zo on the topic of a relationship with a hidden agenda.

607
00:45:42,807 --> 00:45:46,151
I don’t think anyone knows how fast my heart is racing now.

608
00:45:46,151 --> 00:45:49,667
I feel like I might have a crush on someone.
