1
00:00:00,211 --> 00:00:01,784
Ever been here with anyone else?

2
00:00:01,784 --> 00:00:04,844
I had this friend, Puen.

3
00:00:05,331 --> 00:00:06,266
That jerk?

4
00:00:06,876 --> 00:00:08,720
Zo, it’s been a while since we last met.

5
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,724
I'm really sorry.

6
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:12,441
Give her time.

7
00:00:12,695 --> 00:00:14,268
I've never brought anyone home before.

8
00:00:14,708 --> 00:00:19,600
If he backed out because of this, you guys wouldn’t last.

9
00:00:19,751 --> 00:00:21,424
We’re not dating.

10
00:00:21,756 --> 00:00:24,240
You need to step up your game, Joke,

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,366
because I’m kind of fond of this one.

12
00:00:26,467 --> 00:00:28,504
Thank you for being my boyfriend.

13
00:01:02,403 --> 00:01:03,258
Like these?

14
00:01:05,243 --> 00:01:06,815
Noticed you've been eyeing them.

15
00:01:09,522 --> 00:01:10,321
Yeah,

16
00:01:11,226 --> 00:01:14,588
as I keep staring at them,

17
00:01:20,091 --> 00:01:24,076
I feel like the vases keep changing their appearances each time I look.

18
00:01:29,145 --> 00:01:30,140
Do you feel that too?

19
00:01:58,268 --> 00:01:59,480
Are you even listening?

20
00:02:00,988 --> 00:02:01,813
Yes, I am.

21
00:02:03,032 --> 00:02:04,427
Loud and clear.

22
00:02:07,906 --> 00:02:09,328
So why aren't you looking at the vases?

23
00:02:10,903 --> 00:02:13,280
I’ve put them right in front of you many times.

24
00:02:19,198 --> 00:02:20,098
For me,

25
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:23,033
the vases…

26
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:29,280
are not as cute as you.

27
00:02:32,473 --> 00:02:33,397
You …

28
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,657
Come on, let’s go to bed.

29
00:02:39,072 --> 00:02:39,819
Bed?

30
00:02:41,503 --> 00:02:42,555
Are you sleeping here tonight?

31
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,553
Mind if I do?

32
00:04:00,581 --> 00:04:01,928
Why the intense gaze?

33
00:04:04,389 --> 00:04:05,761
Can’t I look at my own boyfriend?

34
00:04:09,059 --> 00:04:10,556
I'm trying to sleep.

35
00:04:11,057 --> 00:04:14,615
Your staring isn't helping.

36
00:04:15,892 --> 00:04:16,895
If you want me to go to bed,

37
00:04:19,408 --> 00:04:20,908
a good night kiss might do the trick.

38
00:04:23,187 --> 00:04:24,960
What kiss?

39
00:04:26,813 --> 00:04:31,578
No! No! Go to sleep! Sleep! No!

40
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:32,687
No!

41
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,715
Please.

42
00:04:35,715 --> 00:04:36,563
No!

43
00:04:39,723 --> 00:04:40,668
Please.

44
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,023
Someone is calling.

45
00:04:55,363 --> 00:04:56,419
That number again.

46
00:04:59,485 --> 00:05:00,624
Again?

47
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,311
What do you mean "again"?

48
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:10,093
I've received multiple calls from this number,

49
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:15,659
but no one speaks when I answer.

50
00:05:18,608 --> 00:05:23,071
I just hear them breathing on the other end.

51
00:05:24,196 --> 00:05:26,196
Don't believe me? Answer it.

52
00:05:31,141 --> 00:05:32,212
I'm not sure this is a good idea.

53
00:05:40,203 --> 00:05:41,132
Hello.

54
00:06:00,077 --> 00:06:02,479
Shit, this is scary.

55
00:06:03,401 --> 00:06:04,773
See? I told you.

56
00:06:05,374 --> 00:06:06,746
Is this a phone scam?

57
00:06:07,324 --> 00:06:08,200
I don't know.

58
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:20,067
Hand me the phone.

59
00:06:22,843 --> 00:06:23,650
What are you up to?

60
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,289
Let me tell you, I’m going to block this number now.

61
00:06:30,295 --> 00:06:32,169
This could be the safest way for you.

62
00:06:33,072 --> 00:06:34,027
Eliminate the risk.

63
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,206
You care about me, huh?

64
00:06:44,072 --> 00:06:44,984
Duh!

65
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,960
And I'm worried about me too.

66
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,560
We spend so much time together.

67
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:56,288
If he had a grudge against you and knew we were together,

68
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,072
I could be an unintended victim.

69
00:07:02,941 --> 00:07:05,217
You are not a romantic.

70
00:07:08,014 --> 00:07:09,800
Here you go. Let's go to sleep.

71
00:07:59,003 --> 00:08:01,908
I said you didn't have to drop me here.

72
00:08:03,429 --> 00:08:04,960
But I wanted to.

73
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:11,720
Look at the way you're dressed. People are looking.

74
00:08:18,853 --> 00:08:19,975
Who cares?

75
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:22,486
I just wanted to see my boyfriend off.

76
00:08:23,761 --> 00:08:24,537
That's all.

77
00:08:31,071 --> 00:08:32,396
This is where you stop.

78
00:08:33,676 --> 00:08:34,701
I see my friends there.

79
00:08:37,264 --> 00:08:40,200
I can walk you over. It's only a few steps away.

80
00:08:40,511 --> 00:08:41,364
No need.

81
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:46,482
With your outfit, it’d be best if you went back to sleep.

82
00:08:48,024 --> 00:08:49,496
I don't want to explain things to them.

83
00:08:51,963 --> 00:08:52,776
Before I go…

84
00:08:59,235 --> 00:09:00,360
What now?

85
00:09:01,231 --> 00:09:02,653
I could use a goodbye hug.

86
00:09:03,187 --> 00:09:04,292
Let me recharge.

87
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,930
No way!

88
00:09:06,531 --> 00:09:07,679
Please.

89
00:09:08,232 --> 00:09:09,662
Too many people here.

90
00:09:09,662 --> 00:09:10,353
What’s that?

91
00:09:10,353 --> 00:09:11,263
Too many people here. I can’t.

92
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,972
It’s alright.

93
00:09:14,329 --> 00:09:15,363
It’s embarrassing.

94
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:19,659
Can't I just get a hug from my boyfriend? Please.

95
00:09:43,975 --> 00:09:44,859
That's enough.

96
00:09:49,659 --> 00:09:50,926
I'll pick you up after class.

97
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,356
See you then.

98
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:54,671
Okay.

99
00:09:57,303 --> 00:09:57,995
I’ve got to go.

100
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,152
Bye.

101
00:10:13,297 --> 00:10:15,800
Darling, I miss you.

102
00:10:15,841 --> 00:10:17,841
I miss you too.

103
00:10:21,177 --> 00:10:23,051
I do not want to go to class, Joke.

104
00:10:23,051 --> 00:10:24,443
I hate being away from you.

105
00:10:25,747 --> 00:10:28,174
The pain of missing someone is real.

106
00:10:29,403 --> 00:10:30,775
Serioulsy, guys?

107
00:10:31,024 --> 00:10:33,024
We were copying you.

108
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,673
It's just an imitation.

109
00:10:36,015 --> 00:10:38,769
Nothing beats a genuine hug.

110
00:10:38,769 --> 00:10:40,745
Absolutely.

111
00:10:42,145 --> 00:10:45,778
Don't you guys have something better to do than tease me?

112
00:10:46,684 --> 00:10:48,684
Not really. I only have one class today.

113
00:10:48,684 --> 00:10:50,132
I'll go back to gaming soon.

114
00:10:50,418 --> 00:10:53,046
Yeah, and I’ve got football practice.

115
00:10:55,319 --> 00:10:57,118
How are you both so relaxed

116
00:10:57,704 --> 00:10:59,704
when I'm running between faculties all alone?

117
00:11:00,012 --> 00:11:03,080
You should’ve followed my advice to have a packed schedule in senior year.

118
00:11:03,293 --> 00:11:04,616
But you wanted to graduate early

119
00:11:04,616 --> 00:11:06,474
because of the debate competition.

120
00:11:37,609 --> 00:11:43,328
[Joke: Feeling a bit lonely?]

121
00:11:43,992 --> 00:11:45,992
[Zo: So you think you've got me figured out?]

122
00:11:46,648 --> 00:11:49,000
[Joke: Sure, I do care about you, you know.]

123
00:11:51,698 --> 00:11:53,321
[Zo: Ugh!]

124
00:11:54,254 --> 00:11:56,254
[Joke: Made any friends in your class yet?]

125
00:12:01,906 --> 00:12:03,440
[Zo: Not really.]

126
00:12:04,352 --> 00:12:05,640
[Joke: Shoot me a text after, I'll come pick you up.]

127
00:12:10,038 --> 00:12:11,485
[Zo: Okay.]

128
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:25,115
Excuse me, is this seat taken?

129
00:12:26,706 --> 00:12:27,443
No, it’s free.

130
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,547
Mind if I sit here?

131
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,515
Go right ahead.

132
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,257
Thanks.

133
00:12:43,769 --> 00:12:47,051
Alright, everyone, let’s get settled.

134
00:12:48,795 --> 00:12:50,267
Ready for the lesson?

135
00:13:01,383 --> 00:13:03,383
You here by yourself?

136
00:13:07,313 --> 00:13:09,414
I wanted to finish all my credits before senior year.

137
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:13,120
Turns out, none of my buddies felt the same.

138
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:13,910
I see.

139
00:13:15,446 --> 00:13:17,520
I’m Poom, by the way.

140
00:13:17,923 --> 00:13:18,671
From Humanities.

141
00:13:20,304 --> 00:13:22,988
I’m Zo, Political Science, IR major.

142
00:13:25,668 --> 00:13:27,005
You’ve come a long way, huh?

143
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:30,658
Why are you here alone?

144
00:13:32,173 --> 00:13:33,545
Same reason as you.

145
00:13:35,462 --> 00:13:36,959
I feel you.

146
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:44,188
In that case, mind if we stick together this semester?

147
00:13:44,961 --> 00:13:46,484
Sounds good to me.

148
00:14:03,995 --> 00:14:05,995
[Zo: Looks like I’ve made a friend.]

149
00:14:23,871 --> 00:14:25,340
You might think this class is a breeze,

150
00:14:25,956 --> 00:14:28,436
but I've heard from seniors that there's a ton of homework.

151
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:29,926
Really?

152
00:14:32,273 --> 00:14:35,082
I guess I didn't look into it enough before signing up.

153
00:14:35,598 --> 00:14:38,407
Word is, after the first week, there's an assignment due every single week.

154
00:14:38,604 --> 00:14:39,313
Seriously?

155
00:14:43,027 --> 00:14:45,026
Did I just shoot myself in the foot?

156
00:14:46,487 --> 00:14:48,487
Anyway, are you free now?

157
00:14:51,504 --> 00:14:52,974
Want to grab something to eat somewhere close?

158
00:14:57,952 --> 00:15:01,994
I'd love to, but I’ve already got plans.

159
00:15:04,898 --> 00:15:06,620
Always on the go, huh?

160
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:09,408
You're teasing me already.

161
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:17,735
Hold on a sec.

162
00:15:17,735 --> 00:15:18,281
Sure.

163
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,283
Hello.

164
00:15:25,193 --> 00:15:27,116
Where are you? Done with class?

165
00:15:28,547 --> 00:15:31,406
Just finished. Heading out now.

166
00:15:32,423 --> 00:15:33,772
Why didn’t you let me know?

167
00:15:34,025 --> 00:15:35,403
I said I’d come get you.

168
00:15:35,654 --> 00:15:36,526
Oh, right!

169
00:15:37,654 --> 00:15:39,243
I'm so sorry.

170
00:15:39,243 --> 00:15:42,326
I got caught up in a conversation with a new classmate.

171
00:15:45,007 --> 00:15:47,891
Meet me by the Humanities Building.

172
00:15:48,215 --> 00:15:48,953
I'll be right down.

173
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:50,867
Alright,

174
00:15:51,979 --> 00:15:54,409
I'm on my way. Just hang tight.

175
00:15:56,096 --> 00:15:56,859
Will do.

176
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,324
Catch you soon.

177
00:16:02,057 --> 00:16:05,371
Why don't we walk together…

178
00:16:15,014 --> 00:16:16,534
Is he an alien or what?

179
00:16:25,645 --> 00:16:26,375
Hi,

180
00:16:27,462 --> 00:16:28,328
I'm here.

181
00:16:28,911 --> 00:16:32,427
Cool, just wrapped up class. Be down in a sec.

182
00:16:34,381 --> 00:16:35,403
I'm at our spot.

183
00:16:36,009 --> 00:16:39,009
Hurry, can't wait to see you.

184
00:16:44,482 --> 00:16:49,163
[Mew: Hello, there. Do you remember me?]

185
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:01,640
[Jeng: How could I forget?]

186
00:17:02,237 --> 00:17:06,963
[Mew: Great to hear! I was hoping to get some advice on what to study next.  Would you mind helping me with that?]

187
00:17:48,529 --> 00:17:49,588
What were you doing?

188
00:17:50,397 --> 00:17:51,540
I was standing there watching you for a while.

189
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:55,926
Well, ummm...

190
00:17:59,523 --> 00:18:02,559
Just got a text from my friend about some last-minute law work.

191
00:18:13,723 --> 00:18:18,578
What's wrong with you? I'm starving here.

192
00:18:24,572 --> 00:18:25,363
Hey,

193
00:18:27,435 --> 00:18:28,164
Pok.

194
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,851
I wasn’t being honest earlier.

195
00:18:36,908 --> 00:18:47,247
During the open house, a high schooler asked for my IG, and I gave it to her.

196
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:53,087
She just hit me up for study advice.

197
00:18:57,851 --> 00:18:59,359
Why did you lie?

198
00:19:00,648 --> 00:19:01,729
You could have told me.

199
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:07,740
I didn't want you to worry.

200
00:19:08,876 --> 00:19:12,872
And I thought it might strain things between us.

201
00:19:18,067 --> 00:19:22,897
Thank you for telling me the truth.

202
00:19:26,869 --> 00:19:27,850
Don't fret.

203
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:32,180
If you’ve got no hidden agenda, we're good.

204
00:19:45,493 --> 00:19:46,783
You said you couldn’t wait to see my face.

205
00:19:48,122 --> 00:19:50,323
Here's my face right in front of you.

206
00:19:56,341 --> 00:20:00,160
Let's head back to our place and find something to eat. I'm famished.

207
00:20:01,145 --> 00:20:01,863
Please.

208
00:20:02,924 --> 00:20:03,852
You mean food, right?

209
00:20:06,586 --> 00:20:08,308
Yes, food.

210
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:11,426
Okay.

211
00:20:19,032 --> 00:20:19,881
Let’s go.

212
00:20:24,498 --> 00:20:25,225
What are you in the mood for?

213
00:20:25,831 --> 00:20:28,039
What’ve we got left in the fridge?

214
00:20:38,851 --> 00:20:39,914
Man, I'm stuffed.

215
00:20:40,123 --> 00:20:41,515
Well, you should be.

216
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:45,327
You basically cleaned out every stall in China Town.

217
00:20:49,026 --> 00:20:50,647
I had classes all day, okay?

218
00:20:51,463 --> 00:20:52,680
Needed to refuel.

219
00:20:54,537 --> 00:20:55,599
Hey, no judgment here.

220
00:20:57,292 --> 00:20:58,407
Seeing you happy and full

221
00:20:59,857 --> 00:21:00,877
actually makes me happy.

222
00:21:01,989 --> 00:21:04,384
You've been spouting some real Hallmark lines lately, you know?

223
00:21:06,105 --> 00:21:07,163
Hey, I can't help it.

224
00:21:08,105 --> 00:21:08,956
Plus,

225
00:21:10,472 --> 00:21:11,726
I only say that stuff to you.

226
00:21:18,406 --> 00:21:19,147
What?

227
00:21:20,406 --> 00:21:21,311
You biting back now?

228
00:21:23,537 --> 00:21:24,342
Of course.

229
00:21:25,656 --> 00:21:33,446
I didn't see your new friend when I came to get you.

230
00:21:34,854 --> 00:21:35,651
Who is he?

231
00:21:36,485 --> 00:21:39,406
His name's Poom, from the Humanities faculty.

232
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:42,897
I was kind of thrown off, too.

233
00:21:43,362 --> 00:21:46,550
He vanished the second I picked up your call.

234
00:21:49,133 --> 00:21:50,239
Did he have to rush off or something?

235
00:21:52,336 --> 00:21:54,039
I don't think so.

236
00:21:54,915 --> 00:21:56,966
He'd actually asked me to grab a snack with him.

237
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,823
Then poof, he's gone.

238
00:21:59,023 --> 00:22:00,201
Like he was beamed up by a UFO or something.

239
00:22:04,243 --> 00:22:08,881
Maybe just ask him about it next time you bump into him.

240
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:13,787
I'm sure it's nothing.

241
00:22:14,489 --> 00:22:15,577
Not worth fussing over.

242
00:22:18,763 --> 00:22:22,283
Anyway, I need to shower. I feel gross.

243
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:24,948
Just a shower.

244
00:22:26,372 --> 00:22:27,285
Mind if I join you?

245
00:22:27,917 --> 00:22:30,363
Let go, or I swear I'll bite you.

246
00:22:30,363 --> 00:22:31,087
Go ahead.

247
00:22:34,163 --> 00:22:35,388
You’re as menacing as a puppy.

248
00:22:37,317 --> 00:22:38,382
Do it, bite it off.

249
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,039
Let go already.

250
00:22:43,136 --> 00:22:44,207
It’s shower time.

251
00:22:47,008 --> 00:22:48,629
Let me join you, Zo.

252
00:22:54,577 --> 00:22:56,880
No sleeping in my class.

253
00:23:03,052 --> 00:23:08,083
Now that you’ve finished the Psychology for Leadership course,

254
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:09,841
it’s time to put it to the test.

255
00:23:11,047 --> 00:23:17,166
Team up in pairs and select a leader.

256
00:23:17,485 --> 00:23:22,113
Analyze their personality using what you’ve learned.

257
00:23:22,244 --> 00:23:24,244
This assignment is due next Friday.

258
00:23:24,244 --> 00:23:25,164
Class dismissed for today,

259
00:23:26,886 --> 00:23:33,803
so you've got some time for research

260
00:23:35,083 --> 00:23:35,968
Thank you.

261
00:23:36,297 --> 00:23:37,235
Thank you.

262
00:23:48,227 --> 00:23:50,227
Shit!

263
00:23:52,229 --> 00:23:54,243
Poom, what the hell, man?

264
00:23:55,723 --> 00:23:56,866
Just messing with you.

265
00:23:57,498 --> 00:23:58,355
You nearly scared me to death.

266
00:24:00,749 --> 00:24:02,345
Why are you so late?

267
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,163
Attendance was ages ago.

268
00:24:05,796 --> 00:24:10,146
Missing attendance is small potatoes compared to exams and assignments.

269
00:24:11,484 --> 00:24:13,484
Speaking of assignments,

270
00:24:13,484 --> 00:24:15,636
we just got one. We need to pair up,

271
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:22,778
pick a leader, and analyze their personality using the theory learned.

272
00:24:24,243 --> 00:24:26,243
The deadline is next week.

273
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:28,349
And we need to present it in class.

274
00:24:28,662 --> 00:24:30,965
See? I told you.

275
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,541
Who did you pair up with?

276
00:24:36,891 --> 00:24:38,234
Do you even need to ask?

277
00:24:39,484 --> 00:24:41,787
It's not like I've got a friend list to choose from here.

278
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:53,429
Where should we go to work on this?

279
00:24:55,913 --> 00:24:57,408
I don't have a lot of free time these days.

280
00:24:59,691 --> 00:25:00,861
The library.

281
00:25:01,691 --> 00:25:02,850
Today. Let me check the availability.

282
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:03,374
Sounds good.

283
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:08,108
Do we have a shot?

284
00:25:11,303 --> 00:25:12,425
It's fully booked!

285
00:25:17,715 --> 00:25:19,134
I’ve got a roommate.

286
00:25:19,987 --> 00:25:21,229
Any other ideas?

287
00:25:33,886 --> 00:25:37,563
I think I know a spot we could use.

288
00:25:37,993 --> 00:25:39,664
Great, where?

289
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:53,583
You’re bringing your friend to your place?

290
00:25:54,405 --> 00:25:56,986
Yeah, just to work on an assignment.

291
00:26:00,382 --> 00:26:01,902
Is this friend trustworthy?

292
00:26:03,225 --> 00:26:04,307
Yeah, he’s cool.

293
00:26:04,888 --> 00:26:05,857
Don't worry.

294
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:11,093
Fine. Call me if you need anything.

295
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:12,329
Will do.

296
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:14,008
Okay.

297
00:26:31,979 --> 00:26:33,021
Bro!

298
00:26:36,256 --> 00:26:37,214
Are you there?

299
00:26:45,502 --> 00:26:46,223
Jeng,

300
00:26:47,941 --> 00:26:49,220
what are you doing here?

301
00:26:49,488 --> 00:26:51,286
You’re the reason.

302
00:26:51,851 --> 00:26:54,243
Diving into online shopping now, huh?

303
00:26:55,444 --> 00:26:56,467
What are you even talking about?

304
00:26:56,796 --> 00:26:59,365
Come on, bro! Tell me what you bought.

305
00:27:00,003 --> 00:27:00,872
Or…

306
00:27:03,702 --> 00:27:04,833
That was uncalled for!

307
00:27:05,938 --> 00:27:07,443
Your mind's in the gutter.

308
00:27:08,056 --> 00:27:09,626
I did not order anything.

309
00:27:09,737 --> 00:27:11,737
If you didn’t, then explain this.

310
00:27:12,075 --> 00:27:14,075
I saw it when I was picking up my package, so I grabbed it for you.

311
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:20,069
Seriously though, this is weird.
[ JOKE ]

312
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,500
No one in their right mind would write your name like that.

313
00:27:33,406 --> 00:27:34,596
Why don't you open it?

314
00:27:35,607 --> 00:27:37,083
Don't you want to know what's inside?

315
00:27:43,003 --> 00:27:43,966
Got to sniff it, huh?

316
00:28:20,658 --> 00:28:22,200
Who would do something like this?

317
00:28:31,215 --> 00:28:31,929
Zo!

318
00:28:33,215 --> 00:28:35,006
Where are you going? Wait for me!

319
00:29:32,585 --> 00:29:33,556
So, you’re into ceramic sculpture?

320
00:29:36,461 --> 00:29:38,526
I was about to ask you the same thing.

321
00:29:38,951 --> 00:29:40,624
You into it?

322
00:29:43,171 --> 00:29:45,421
Not much at first.

323
00:29:47,461 --> 00:29:51,019
But as I kept going, it turned out to be fun.

324
00:29:52,047 --> 00:29:54,162
Looks like you went with someone special.

325
00:29:55,047 --> 00:29:56,163
Your smile says it all.

326
00:29:59,261 --> 00:30:00,087
I should head out.

327
00:30:01,658 --> 00:30:03,466
I'll leave the assignment with you for now.

328
00:30:04,807 --> 00:30:08,211
Sounds good. We'll present it together next week.

329
00:30:09,994 --> 00:30:12,566
Let me walk you out.

330
00:30:13,154 --> 00:30:13,742
Okay.

331
00:30:44,974 --> 00:30:46,262
Where’s my key?

332
00:30:46,813 --> 00:30:48,101
I just used it to get in.

333
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:50,134
Need help looking for it?

334
00:30:51,711 --> 00:30:54,888
Nah, let me walk you out first.

335
00:30:56,158 --> 00:30:57,043
Let's go.

336
00:31:17,117 --> 00:31:17,927
Hold on a sec.

337
00:31:27,728 --> 00:31:30,579
Good thing I left a spare key here. Come on.

338
00:31:30,911 --> 00:31:31,539
Okay.

339
00:31:36,215 --> 00:31:36,855
Let’s move.

340
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:11,200
Zo!

341
00:32:19,491 --> 00:32:20,055
Zo!

342
00:32:33,858 --> 00:32:35,108
Joke, why are you yelling?

343
00:32:35,903 --> 00:32:37,634
You're going to wake up the whole building.

344
00:32:39,647 --> 00:32:40,655
Are you alright?

345
00:32:41,828 --> 00:32:43,147
I couldn't get a hold of you.

346
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:44,837
I thought something had happened.

347
00:32:47,376 --> 00:32:50,704
I just got out of the shower, so I missed your calls.

348
00:32:56,488 --> 00:32:59,565
Where is your study buddy?

349
00:33:01,087 --> 00:33:02,394
He left a while ago.

350
00:33:10,691 --> 00:33:11,498
Want to grab a bite?

351
00:33:14,422 --> 00:33:15,211
Something wrong?

352
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:18,123
Come on, let's go out.

353
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:20,481
I've got something to tell you.

354
00:33:27,199 --> 00:33:28,046
Wait, the stalker?

355
00:33:30,547 --> 00:33:32,008
I think he's back in action.

356
00:33:34,898 --> 00:33:37,995
But you and Nita caught him, right?

357
00:33:39,131 --> 00:33:40,842
Nita and I knew who he was.

358
00:33:41,989 --> 00:33:44,739
But we didn’t have enough evidence to pin him down.

359
00:33:47,642 --> 00:33:49,757
I've received threats like this before

360
00:33:50,418 --> 00:33:52,046
when Nita and I were fake-dating.

361
00:33:53,411 --> 00:33:54,523
Then he vanished.

362
00:33:55,889 --> 00:33:59,009
Why would he come after us now?

363
00:34:00,932 --> 00:34:01,967
I seriously have no idea.

364
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:07,356
What I know is that we’ve got to be careful from now on.

365
00:34:08,507 --> 00:34:10,411
I don't know if he's holding a grudge against me

366
00:34:11,248 --> 00:34:13,152
and is planning to harm people around me or not.

367
00:34:23,998 --> 00:34:24,728
Are you scared?

368
00:34:31,523 --> 00:34:32,452
Don't worry,

369
00:34:34,046 --> 00:34:34,854
I'll take care of you.

370
00:34:36,027 --> 00:34:37,392
Here you go.

371
00:34:43,697 --> 00:34:44,408
Open your mouth.

372
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,378
Thanks for walking me home.

373
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:07,927
Of course.

374
00:35:08,993 --> 00:35:11,205
Are you sure you don't want me to stay with you?

375
00:35:12,904 --> 00:35:13,772
I am sure.

376
00:35:14,041 --> 00:35:15,615
I’ll be fine on my own.

377
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:19,394
Alright,

378
00:35:20,356 --> 00:35:21,180
sweet dreams.

379
00:35:22,735 --> 00:35:23,389
And call me.

380
00:35:24,082 --> 00:35:24,691
Will do.

381
00:35:26,307 --> 00:35:27,236
Safe trip home.

382
00:35:37,846 --> 00:35:38,472
Catch you later.

383
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:41,220
Bye.

384
00:35:53,464 --> 00:35:54,127
Joke!

385
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:56,734
Zo!

386
00:36:00,082 --> 00:36:01,010
What happened?

387
00:36:01,683 --> 00:36:02,447
Well…

388
00:36:08,037 --> 00:36:08,943
Who did this?

389
00:36:10,366 --> 00:36:11,614
No clue.

390
00:36:14,694 --> 00:36:18,926
The key that I used to get in with my friend earlier is missing.

391
00:36:21,105 --> 00:36:24,336
So I'm using my spare key for now.

392
00:36:25,847 --> 00:36:27,635
I still can't find the original.

393
00:36:31,412 --> 00:36:32,719
Your friend.

394
00:37:29,375 --> 00:37:30,435
Hello,

395
00:37:32,197 --> 00:37:33,267
are you there?

396
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:37,065
Oh, my. I lost track of time.

397
00:37:37,583 --> 00:37:38,903
I was too focused on studying.

398
00:37:38,903 --> 00:37:41,578
I'll head over now.

399
00:37:41,578 --> 00:37:43,276
Okay, bye.

400
00:37:43,276 --> 00:37:43,994
See you soon.

401
00:38:17,625 --> 00:38:18,946
Hello, what’s up, Zo?

402
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,350
Where are you?

403
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:22,431
I need a favor.

404
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:25,213
I’m at a snack shop. What’s up?

405
00:38:25,753 --> 00:38:28,286
Something urgent came up. I need to head back to my hometown.

406
00:38:28,286 --> 00:38:33,061
Could you grab the assignment from my place and hand it in next week?

407
00:38:34,273 --> 00:38:35,061
Sure thing.

408
00:38:36,273 --> 00:38:37,485
You going to be gone long?

409
00:38:37,792 --> 00:38:39,481
Yeah, I think so.

410
00:38:40,227 --> 00:38:42,227
You remember where my spare key is, right?

411
00:38:43,595 --> 00:38:44,740
Yep.

412
00:38:45,188 --> 00:38:48,768
Grab it tonight if you have time, so you don't forget.

413
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:53,750
Sure. On my way.

414
00:41:10,318 --> 00:41:11,774
What are you up to, James?

415
00:41:15,796 --> 00:41:16,556
Joke?

416
00:41:23,412 --> 00:41:24,868
You set this up?

417
00:41:25,628 --> 00:41:28,276
We set this up to catch you in the act.

418
00:41:29,289 --> 00:41:30,178
You stalker!

419
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:32,688
Stalker?

420
00:41:35,751 --> 00:41:39,176
Tell him, Zo. I'm here to get our assignment, like you asked.

421
00:41:46,846 --> 00:41:50,349
I'm thinking I'll have to redo the assignment.

422
00:41:52,537 --> 00:41:57,128
Since my 'partner' isn't even enrolled in this class.

423
00:42:01,981 --> 00:42:03,774
What's the deal, Poom?

424
00:42:06,262 --> 00:42:09,376
Or should I say, James?

425
00:42:10,671 --> 00:42:11,543
Well, I…

426
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:19,848
I feel bad for Nita.

427
00:42:21,554 --> 00:42:24,901
Joke is gay, but he’s using her as a cover.

428
00:42:26,298 --> 00:42:30,681
Can't you see how miserable she is because of you? You bastard!

429
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:34,314
Let’s calm down!

430
00:42:34,314 --> 00:42:35,813
Just stop!

431
00:42:35,813 --> 00:42:36,405
Stop!

432
00:42:36,624 --> 00:42:38,365
Want to beat me up?

433
00:42:39,324 --> 00:42:40,184
Enough!

434
00:42:40,926 --> 00:42:42,309
Want to beat me up?

435
00:42:45,222 --> 00:42:47,646
Stop! That’s enough!

436
00:42:47,975 --> 00:42:48,913
Enough!

437
00:43:14,276 --> 00:43:15,062
Nita,

438
00:43:16,124 --> 00:43:17,778
I’m doing all of this for you.

439
00:43:20,516 --> 00:43:21,232
Really?

440
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:24,966
Then you can explain it to the police.

441
00:43:27,582 --> 00:43:28,349
Nita!

442
00:43:49,734 --> 00:43:53,000
You alright after that fight?

443
00:43:53,855 --> 00:43:56,371
I'm fine, and he started it.

444
00:43:58,872 --> 00:44:00,173
I'm glad you're okay.

445
00:44:04,014 --> 00:44:05,807
Thank you, both of you.

446
00:44:08,498 --> 00:44:10,705
No problem. That's what friends are for.

447
00:44:14,487 --> 00:44:16,435
I feel like I can finally breathe easy.

448
00:44:17,402 --> 00:44:20,438
I've been having a weird feeling for a while now.

449
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:25,258
I can’t believe your IG story set him off,

450
00:44:25,613 --> 00:44:27,613
thinking you broke my heart or something.

451
00:44:29,778 --> 00:44:32,788
Who could've guessed he'd take it that way?

452
00:44:36,954 --> 00:44:40,042
Thank you so much.

453
00:44:42,864 --> 00:44:47,166
I should get going. Don't want to intrude any longer.

454
00:44:47,817 --> 00:44:48,812
Get home safe.

455
00:44:49,201 --> 00:44:50,206
- Safe travels.
- Bye.

456
00:44:58,228 --> 00:44:59,926
Should I be jealous of you and Nita?

457
00:45:02,297 --> 00:45:05,540
There's no reason to be jealous. Let's head upstairs.

458
00:45:21,322 --> 00:45:22,109
What are you looking at?

459
00:45:29,751 --> 00:45:32,726
The sky looks amazing after the rain.

460
00:45:33,805 --> 00:45:39,017
Don't trust a stranger too easily, okay?

461
00:45:42,514 --> 00:45:46,146
If something comes up, we always talk, alright?

462
00:45:49,305 --> 00:45:50,243
I promise.

463
00:46:56,935 --> 00:46:57,833
Something wrong?

464
00:46:59,698 --> 00:47:03,805
I can wait if you're not ready.

465
00:47:07,646 --> 00:47:08,541
I just…

466
00:47:12,116 --> 00:47:13,299
I'm not sure.

467
00:47:15,592 --> 00:47:16,358
That's okay.

468
00:47:18,275 --> 00:47:19,374
Until you're ready,

469
00:47:21,037 --> 00:47:21,871
I can wait.

470
00:49:02,985 --> 00:49:03,871
Joke.

471
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:08,771
Huh?

472
00:49:12,916 --> 00:49:17,966
I’ve never…

473
00:49:23,253 --> 00:49:24,493
What’s with the smile?

474
00:49:27,369 --> 00:49:28,828
It makes me self-conscious.

475
00:49:30,967 --> 00:49:39,081
I promise that when you’re with me, you’ll feel good.

476
00:49:41,289 --> 00:49:44,325
You trust me, right, Zo?

477
00:49:47,318 --> 00:49:47,997
Yeah,

478
00:49:50,691 --> 00:49:53,825
Joke, I trust you.

479
00:50:33,935 --> 00:50:34,799
What's the matter?

480
00:50:35,421 --> 00:50:36,557
When are you going to tell me?

481
00:50:37,872 --> 00:50:38,784
Tell you what?

482
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:43,504
Why did our relationship have to start with a lie?

483
00:50:44,426 --> 00:50:45,804
I'm moving back to my old place.

484
00:50:46,537 --> 00:50:47,786
Can you please not do this?

485
00:50:48,193 --> 00:50:51,406
The problem is, I don't know where I fit in your damn life!

486
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:54,763
Think about it; there was nothing bad.

487
00:50:54,763 --> 00:50:56,781
So you don't think you're wrong?

488
00:50:57,085 --> 00:51:00,044
Seriously, I don’t think this is enough for me.
