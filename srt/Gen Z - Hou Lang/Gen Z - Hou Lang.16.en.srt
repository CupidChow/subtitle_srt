(Episode 16)

3
00:01:38,464 --> 00:01:39,584
(Qingyixuan Antiques Store)

4
00:01:39,665 --> 00:01:41,745
You don't want
to do business with us, do you?

5
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,000
Do you know you're embezzling assets?

6
00:01:44,279 --> 00:01:45,479
It's hard for me too.

7
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,640
It's...
I've been scolding him for one morning.

8
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,359
Who did you sell to?
Go and get it back.

9
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,640
The main problem is that
I don't know who I sold it to.

10
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,800
He's not a regular customer.

11
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,800
How about the CCTV?

12
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:02,439
It's already broken,
merely for display purposes.

13
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,920
Not me.

14
00:02:18,999 --> 00:02:19,999
Yeah, right.

15
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,880
No, it's really...

16
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:25,840
It has nothing to do with me.
Isn't that right, boss?

17
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,920
I'm...

18
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,135
Boss.

19
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:29,359
Get your staff to check it out.

20
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,040
You have to get it back.

21
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,680
You are truly black-hearted.

22
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,359
Just 100,000 yuan. You're...

23
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:36,840
-I sold it.
-You're really...

24
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,280
I don't want to comment on you.

25
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,959
Where is the Chenpi water
that I asked you to soak up for me?

26
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,960
I beg your pardon.

27
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,120
What's wrong with you?

28
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,280
Chenpi...

29
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,160
You're so distracted.

30
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,400
Xin Zheng,

31
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,239
our son's pendant

32
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:14,040
is really gone this time.

33
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,599
It's gone this time?

34
00:03:20,999 --> 00:03:21,999
How about the previous times?

35
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,400
Well...

36
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,040
I don't know.

37
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,679
Where is your agarwood pendant?

38
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,679
Where did you go yesterday?

39
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,480
I don't know.

40
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,400
Don't you know where you've been?

41
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,120
I'm talking to you.

42
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,200
Ren Tian Zhen.

43
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,879
You are almost 28 years old.

44
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,760
When will you be able
to live like a human being?

45
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:20,120
Do you know how precious
that pendant means to you?

46
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,680
That's the expectation of our
several generations of family for you!

47
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,760
Xin Zheng.

48
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,959
-Mum.
-Can't you talk nicely?

49
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:30,319
Explain to your grandma!

50
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:32,200
This is not the first time, right?

51
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:37,599
Where did you go yesterday?

52
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:40,200
Be honest!

53
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,560
Xin Zheng.

54
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:44,120
Be patient when
you're educating your son.

55
00:04:44,719 --> 00:04:47,079
Give him some time to grow.

56
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,879
Everyone's point of enlightenment

57
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:50,400
is different.

58
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,200
There are not many wunderkinder like you

59
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,439
who have been
persistent in their ambition.

60
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,239
I'd rather Tian Zhen

61
00:04:58,719 --> 00:05:00,200
be warming the bench for ten years.

62
00:05:01,492 --> 00:05:03,652
In the end, he will be a late bloomer.

63
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,920
Master,

64
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:08,319
can I beg you for one thing?

65
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,239
When I teach my son,
please don't protect him.

66
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,439
I don't expect him

67
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:20,599
to be a late bloomer anymore.

68
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:23,159
I'm afraid he's useless.

69
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,879
He is my only son.

70
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,439
I hope
you'll be honest with your parents.

71
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:34,319
To be an honest man!

72
00:05:35,679 --> 00:05:36,679
Your dad is right.

73
00:05:36,719 --> 00:05:37,891
Tell the truth

74
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,200
and admit your mistake.

75
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:43,200
From now on,
you won't leave anything behind.

76
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,079
Mum, it's not a matter
of leaving things behind.

77
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:47,239
You say that you lecture your child,

78
00:05:47,679 --> 00:05:49,480
but you don't even know how old I am.

79
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,120
I'm 25 years old this year,

80
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:52,319
I'm not 28 years old.

81
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:56,119
You either ignore me or lecture me.

82
00:05:56,719 --> 00:05:58,279
There is no place for me
in your lofty ideals

83
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,680
of teaching, nurturing people,

84
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,159
and carrying on the tradition.

85
00:06:14,599 --> 00:06:15,599
What's up?

86
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:24,680
I took his pendant.

87
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,279
What are you doing with his pendant?

88
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,360
I took it to the pawn shop and sold it.

89
00:06:33,119 --> 00:06:35,319
I need money recently.

90
00:06:44,559 --> 00:06:45,680
What do you do with the money?

91
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:50,167
When I worked as
a delivery rider, I was

92
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,759
playing poker with them.

93
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:53,839
And then

94
00:06:54,119 --> 00:06:55,919
I owed them a lot of money.

95
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,199
I thought that pendant

96
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,680
was worth a lot of money.

97
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,760
Therefore, I

98
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:01,439
took it.

99
00:07:03,719 --> 00:07:06,040
Master, I've been evil again.

100
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,200
I'm sorry.

101
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,444
Why don't you punish me?

102
00:07:09,468 --> 00:07:11,920
I'll find a way
to redeem that pendant by then, can I?

103
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:15,319
What a reckless act!

104
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,120
Get out and get into a horse stance!

105
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,080
You scared me out of my wits!

106
00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:10,640
Take this to Tou Tou.

107
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:12,879
No one can squat like this for a day.

108
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,439
No need, Sun Tou Tou is very tricky.

109
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,759
It's true if you say she would
play tricks back in the day.

110
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:20,879
But now,

111
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,879
she can really squat
like this for a day.

112
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,800
Give it to her.

113
00:08:27,159 --> 00:08:28,599
She won't take it
if I'm the one who gives her.

114
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,080
What are you doing?

115
00:08:54,199 --> 00:08:55,199
You can sit for a while
if you are tired.

116
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,096
I'll cover for you.

117
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,560
I'm not tired at all.

118
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,560
Hurry up and stay aside.

119
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,735
Can you?

120
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:01,759
I can do it.

121
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,560
Do you think you're Wonder Woman?

122
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:05,999
If you keep squatting like this,
your thighs can't take it.

123
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,975
Don't be stubborn.

124
00:09:06,999 --> 00:09:08,119
Can't I try it?

125
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,200
Go aside.

126
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:10,759
Go aside.

127
00:09:19,599 --> 00:09:20,599
I'm with you.

128
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:24,439
Are you an idiot?

129
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,760
If your dad sees it, he will know
I'm taking the fall for you.

130
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,400
Then my drama just now will be wasted.

131
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,159
Can you get in?

132
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,319
Do you think my dad doesn't know?

133
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:36,120
You can assume
I'm practising next to you.

134
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:38,640
I won't let you practise alone.

135
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:41,400
If I practised well, it's good to
improve the skill of observing.

136
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,200
Tou Tou

137
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,079
is getting calmer.

138
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:17,120
She has squatted for so long
without rest.

139
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,760
It's a bit sunny.

140
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,120
I'm afraid

141
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,760
she will be dehydrated later.

142
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:32,079
Tian Zhen is squatting
together with her as well.

143
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,599
How heavy can you lift?

144
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,599
55 kilograms.

145
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:57,399
All right.

146
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,440
That's okay.

147
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:03,240
You go in and take some rest.

148
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,760
If I collapse later,
you can carry me into the house.

149
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,959
I tell you to eat less before this.

150
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,920
What if I can't carry you later?

151
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,719
What does it have to do
with how much I eat?

152
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,680
Just drag me like a dead dog.

153
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:20,639
I suppose you know
how to drag me in, right?

154
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,320
Xin Zheng,

155
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,120
don't be angry.

156
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,176
Look at them.

157
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,440
Aren't they apologising to you
in a different way?

158
00:11:43,959 --> 00:11:45,680
You know where your son's pendant is,

159
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,200
don't you?

160
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,760
You and your son

161
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,560
have a tacit understanding.

162
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,680
Am I right?

163
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:03,920
He used to travel every year.

164
00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:07,719
Since you nagged him,

165
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,240
and let him fend for himself,

166
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:12,200
don't spend our money,

167
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,200
since then,
he started to leave things behind.

168
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,320
Is that my fault?

169
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:18,959
That's not what I meant.

170
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,999
But our son was right too.

171
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,760
You don't even know how old he is.

172
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,200
You only know how to scold him.

173
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,240
Let me tell you,

174
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,680
a good child grows with praises.

175
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,311
Did I scold him wrongly?

176
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,839
He spends money like water.

177
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,240
He did not even know
how hard his parents earn money.

178
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,319
He didn't do anything bad.

179
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:43,560
He just went on a trip, didn't he?

180
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,639
To read great books
and do great travels.

181
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,633
Both knowledge and conduct
must be unified.

182
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,120
I can tell.

183
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,680
The older and younger
members of the family

184
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,479
are all covering up and condoning him.

185
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:00,639
You should say that

186
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,680
to the elders

187
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,200
in person.

188
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,000
But then again,

189
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:09,639
you said that

190
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,639
our son didn't tell the truth.

191
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:13,920
You should seriously

192
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,639
reflect on yourself too.

193
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,200
You always say,

194
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,599
"Turn inward and examine yourself when
you encounter difficulties in life."

195
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,680
Our son was just

196
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,039
going on a trip,

197
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,399
wasn't he?

198
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,560
When he travelled,

199
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,719
you called him a dude

200
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,320
who's not aware of the hardships.

201
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:33,600
You can't just let him
run off to work in the field

202
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,199
whenever he's free
like you did when you were a kid.

203
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,200
Moreover, we don't have
any field at home, do we?

204
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,760
It's not like you don't know
how dignified your son is.

205
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,200
You always scold him,

206
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,639
will he dare to tell you
the truth in the future?

207
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,200
It means it is my fault again.

208
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,560
It's not like that.

209
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:56,639
It's my fault.

210
00:13:57,079 --> 00:13:58,320
It's my fault.

211
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,560
How can you both be at fault?

212
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,639
I think I should squat there.

213
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Mr Ren.

214
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:11,959
Professor Ren.

215
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:23,330
Don't be angry after
you've had my cup of apologetic tea,

216
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,760
I'll go and get them back.

217
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,320
I get you some water.

218
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:39,639
Tou Tou!

219
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,240
Tou Tou has fainted.

220
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,839
I'm okay.

221
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:02,839
You're too weak.

222
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,839
You prescribe two medications for her.

223
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,440
Let us recuperate her
spleen and stomach first.

224
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,360
After that,
let her drink aconite decoction.

225
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:11,639
Her body is too cold.

226
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Stop drinking ice water.

227
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,000
Get her a thermos.

228
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:19,639
Well...

229
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,560
Niece-in-law,

230
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,680
I don't want
a pink-coloured Old Man Cup.

231
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,880
I don't want pink colour, is it okay?

232
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,360
I don't want yellow either.

233
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:31,880
Is it okay?

234
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,760
I don't want the cup
with a picture, is it okay?

235
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,200
Why did you take on the blame for me?

236
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,160
I'm envious of you.

237
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,959
I don't envy you
for having everything you want.

238
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,760
Well,

239
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,760
every quarrel happened at home

240
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,560
is because of you.

241
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,320
Without you in the future,

242
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,440
these elders must be bored every day.

243
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,240
You're mindless.

244
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,639
You're not answering my question.

245
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,760
Your dad is so angry with you
because of a small mistake you made.

246
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:39,240
But when I made a big mistake,

247
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,159
your dad can forgive me.

248
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,880
Do you know why?

249
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,680
It's because you are his senior aunt.

250
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,079
It's because your dad loves you.

251
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:53,920
It's because that's your dad.

252
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,560
He loves you.

253
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,760
He has hope for you.

254
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,880
He won't care too much

255
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,320
whether I'm good or bad.

256
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,639
All he has done for me
is to fulfil his duty.

257
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,839
Well, it has nothing to do with you
taking the punishment for me.

258
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,519
Oh, my grandson,

259
00:17:16,159 --> 00:17:19,240
I'm an orphan.

260
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,599
No one puts hope in me.

261
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,280
But you are different.

262
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,320
You are the hope of your family.

263
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,360
And

264
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,440
I don't want to disappoint my master.

265
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,959
So you have to work hard,

266
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:36,079
do you understand?

267
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,200
I have high hopes for you.

268
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,440
Do you get me?

269
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,479
But then again,

270
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,880
you are right too.

271
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,399
It's because I like to do the things

272
00:18:01,479 --> 00:18:02,479
that you're doing too.

273
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:03,839
If I have money,

274
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:05,040
I will do the same.

275
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:10,959
But your dad is right too.

276
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,599
So you both are right.

277
00:18:16,639 --> 00:18:19,040
It's perfect for me to take the blame.

278
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,599
Hello.

279
00:18:36,719 --> 00:18:38,399
Tian Zhen, Meng Meng is missing.

280
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:42,359
Where are you?

281
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,759
What exactly happened?

282
00:18:56,239 --> 00:18:57,639
Why has she suddenly disappeared?

283
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:01,119
Meng Meng quarrelled with me.

284
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,320
Quarrel?

285
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,760
I invited my family to have
a reunion meal today at noon.

286
00:19:08,239 --> 00:19:11,249
When the guests arrived, Meng Meng
refused to come out of her room,

287
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,600
not even saying hello.

288
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,600
I went in and nagged her.

289
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,960
You...

290
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,720
You have to understand that

291
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:23,320
Meng Meng is in the situation

292
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,120
that she can't
directly confront strangers

293
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,600
or someone she is unfamiliar with.

294
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,720
They are our relatives

295
00:19:29,879 --> 00:19:31,759
and watched her grow up.

296
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,639
They are not strangers.

297
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:36,600
I've been out on tour for a long time.

298
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:38,400
I tried to squeeze in some time

299
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,520
to celebrate a festival with her.

300
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,680
I thought it would cheer her up

301
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,480
if we had more people.

302
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,560
Who knows...

303
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,080
That's your thought only.

304
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,680
You don't know
what Meng Meng wants, don't you?

305
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:52,399
We are human beings.

306
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,680
We are not puppets that swing at will.

307
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:59,119
It's not like we're willing to stay in
whatever position you want to put us in.

308
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,239
Tian Zhen.

309
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,440
I'm sorry.

310
00:20:09,879 --> 00:20:10,920
He doesn't know any better.

311
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,600
It's okay.

312
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,080
It's more important
to look for Meng Meng now.

313
00:20:14,639 --> 00:20:15,639
Yes.

314
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,760
(Fairy Baker)

315
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,639
Excuse me.

316
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:35,320
Have you seen this girl?

317
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:37,039
No.

318
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,560
Okay, thank you.

319
00:20:56,639 --> 00:20:57,639
Uncle Zhang.

320
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,840
Did Meng Meng go to your place?

321
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,080
Aunt Zhang.

322
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,440
Did Meng Meng go to your place?

323
00:21:01,879 --> 00:21:03,696
I didn't see her
for more than two hours.

324
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,720
Could you help me look for her?

325
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,720
All right.

326
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,239
-Hello.
-(Have you found Meng Meng?)

327
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:36,519
No, I didn't.

328
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,920
I searched everywhere I could.

329
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,879
(If we can't find her,
then call the police.)

330
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,239
No, let's not panic.

331
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,039
After quarrelling,
Meng Meng definitely will go to a place

332
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:48,440
where she feels secure.

333
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,320
So where makes her feel secure?

334
00:21:54,239 --> 00:21:55,519
I know where she is.

335
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,600
How is it? Have you found her?

336
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,320
Have you found her?

337
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:43,840
No, Grandma.

338
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,999
Hasn't Tian Zhen come back yet?

339
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:49,119
-Not yet.
-How is it?

340
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:57,239
Why did you come back alone?
You didn't find her?

341
00:22:58,279 --> 00:22:59,279
Have you found her?

342
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,480
Keep your voice down.

343
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,840
Meng Meng.

344
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,720
Meng Meng.

345
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,600
Are you in there?

346
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:23,960
Come out here, everything is fine.

347
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,200
Everything is fine.

348
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:40,159
Do you remember that she hid there
on the first day she came?

349
00:23:40,239 --> 00:23:42,440
Well, I'm going to call her parents.

350
00:23:47,639 --> 00:23:48,639
Everything is fine.

351
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,720
It's okay, Meng Meng.

352
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,119
After you make a call,

353
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:53,600
let's have a family meeting.

354
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,080
Tou Tou.

355
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,560
You bring Meng Meng go into the room.

356
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,960
Don't come out.

357
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:04,239
Won't I be at the family meeting?

358
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,519
Mum, Meng Meng and Tou Tou
are our family members too.

359
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,960
Let's have a meeting together.

360
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:10,239
Not allowed!

361
00:24:10,845 --> 00:24:12,239
When I'm talking about family meetings,

362
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,119
I mean people
who are blood-related to us.

363
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,560
Ling Lan,

364
00:24:39,999 --> 00:24:41,639
I know what you're thinking.

365
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,039
What are you going to do?

366
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,440
Xin Zheng,

367
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,440
send Xu Meng away tomorrow.

368
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:52,759
We can't have
so many girls in our family.

369
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,440
Why?

370
00:24:57,359 --> 00:24:58,999
She has parents,

371
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,679
but she's fostered in our home.

372
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,641
This thing would have been weird.

373
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,080
What if

374
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,600
something goes wrong,

375
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,200
what should we do?

376
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,960
We are lucky today.

377
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,399
She ran away from her home.

378
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:16,399
What if she runs away
from our home one day?

379
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,999
How do we explain this to her parents?

380
00:25:19,999 --> 00:25:22,720
She came back on the first day
she lived in her house.

381
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:24,400
You're pushing her into the fire pit

382
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,999
if you send her back now.

383
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,639
She won't run away
if she stays at our house.

384
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,600
Everyone has their destiny.

385
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:35,480
Her family relationships are something
she has to deal with on her own.

386
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:36,800
We can't involve in it.

387
00:25:37,999 --> 00:25:38,999
I disagree.

388
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,920
Meng Meng is my patient.

389
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,680
I have to be responsible for her
to the end.

390
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,039
I won't stop you from
being responsible for her.

391
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:49,553
But Meng Meng
doesn't have to stay at our home

392
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,399
for you to heal her.

393
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,840
She has her own home.

394
00:25:53,999 --> 00:25:56,239
Then I will rent a house
and stay together with Meng Meng.

395
00:25:56,399 --> 00:25:57,440
How dare you!

396
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,399
You're out of discipline.

397
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,960
And now, Meng Meng's mentality

398
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,319
is unstable

399
00:26:10,399 --> 00:26:11,960
and very immature.

400
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:14,680
She needs a guardian to accompany her.

401
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,800
Are you her guardian?

402
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:18,960
Can you take that responsibility?

403
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,320
I'm not discussing this
with you all today.

404
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:31,320
I'm telling you all my decision.

405
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,080
Then, I will tell you my decision too.

406
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,039
If you send her away,

407
00:26:36,359 --> 00:26:37,359
I will go with her.

408
00:26:55,399 --> 00:26:56,680
What am I going to say?

409
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,440
Nice drawing.

410
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:30,440
How uncomfortable when
it's pressing against your hand.

411
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,039
Meng Meng, don't be afraid.

412
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:42,320
I won't hurt you.

413
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,200
Meng Meng, I won't do that.

414
00:27:53,639 --> 00:27:57,039
You were hiding in the dark under
the staircase. Were you frightened?

415
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:01,440
Don't be afraid.

416
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,920
I'm here.

417
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,320
I will protect you from now on.

418
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,800
Meng Meng.

419
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:17,320
You're not frightened of me, are you?

420
00:28:22,039 --> 00:28:23,039
Well...

421
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,440
Then you draw first.

422
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,920
Meng Meng.

423
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:46,519
I sit here.

424
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,255
Don't be afraid.

425
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:50,560
I'm here to watch you draw.

426
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,200
I'll be with you.

427
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,920
You may draw it.

428
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:06,279
You may draw it.

429
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,840
That's our son,

430
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,800
why are you angry?

431
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,279
Do I owe you two in my past life?

432
00:29:49,433 --> 00:29:51,313
Why are you torturing me
like this in this life?

433
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:54,039
None of the elders or
the young are obedient.

434
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,800
Why are you involving me again?

435
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,920
Can't you see

436
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:02,560
I scold our son every day?

437
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:06,720
But today I can tell

438
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,800
this kid

439
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,200
can become a great doctor.

440
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:17,560
Are you happy seeing him
go against me, aren't you?

441
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,720
Narrow-minded.

442
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:21,399
Narrow-minded.

443
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,879
I don't believe it.

444
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,639
I have been spoiling him
for over 20 years.

445
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:30,200
I'm going to against him this time.

446
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,359
Does he dare to disown me as his mother?

447
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,680
I'll stay out of

448
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,560
this motherly business.

449
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,440
But I would like to remind you.

450
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,239
A mother fighting with her son...

451
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,080
I won't say anymore.

452
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:56,519
It's pointless

453
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,560
raising a son.

454
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,920
Look at you.

455
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,560
Keep your mouth shut.

456
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,080
Is this a new foot cloth?

457
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,739
(Qibo Medical Centre)

458
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,440
Tou Tou!

459
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:03,399
Have the new cups
not been sterilized yet?

460
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,255
Ms Song said

461
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:05,560
it's for you to use today.

462
00:32:06,039 --> 00:32:07,359
I don't use an Old Man Cup.

463
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:10,680
No need to sterilize it for me.

464
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,039
Why were you shouting?

465
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,560
How's your foot?

466
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,200
It's much better.

467
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,039
Do you need my wife
to check for you again?

468
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,560
No need. Tian Zhen
already gave me the medicinal wine.

469
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,560
Well,

470
00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:56,920
this time you stumbled into the ravine,

471
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,039
but no one helped you.

472
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:03,800
What do you think of this phenomenon?

473
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,840
Do we have a trend of snitching here?

474
00:33:10,359 --> 00:33:11,680
Nobody snitches on you.

475
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,039
Actually, everything we do,

476
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,800
God has the ledgers.

477
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,200
Mr Ren,

478
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,200
if you have anything to say,
just say it.

479
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,080
Look at Sun Tou Tou.

480
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:30,800
Although she has left
our apprentice class,

481
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,759
there are still many students

482
00:33:33,639 --> 00:33:35,800
who wish to bear responsibility for her.

483
00:33:37,639 --> 00:33:39,120
When you stumbled into the ravine,

484
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,920
only Sun Tou Tou

485
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,680
took the initiative to help you.

486
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:44,720
Other students

487
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,440
didn't dare to touch you.

488
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,440
Maybe Sun Tou Tou doesn't
read as many books as you do,

489
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,200
but she makes friends.

490
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,440
What do you think of this phenomenon?

491
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,039
I think

492
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,440
if a person isn't educated

493
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:08,800
and doesn't have
any professional skills,

494
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,319
he must only be able
to get a foothold in the society

495
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:13,800
by making connections with people.

496
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,840
In fact, it's the same for us lawyers.

497
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:19,440
Some people just get acquainted.

498
00:34:19,759 --> 00:34:20,759
But some people

499
00:34:20,999 --> 00:34:22,519
are extremely good at their job.

500
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,480
I'm a technical person.

501
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:30,360
Some are theoretical

502
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,119
whereas some are practical.

503
00:34:32,359 --> 00:34:33,519
Tou Tou is probably not

504
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,600
as knowledgeable as you.

505
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,440
But she likes to take practical ​action.

506
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,600
Perhaps her sensibility

507
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,279
will exceed you.

508
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:45,720
Look at the
first sentence of Heart Sutra,

509
00:34:46,279 --> 00:34:47,800
Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva

510
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:49,920
meditated deeply.

511
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,440
It's not talking about depth.

512
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:54,680
But it refers to meditating deeply.

513
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,720
Hence, don't look down
on the sweeping monk.

514
00:34:59,759 --> 00:35:02,200
Maybe she'll run ahead of you.

515
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,600
Therefore, you'd rather
take her as a disciple

516
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:09,039
and rejected me, right?

517
00:35:09,639 --> 00:35:12,199
That's why you're waiting
for her to achieve her goal,

518
00:35:12,279 --> 00:35:14,119
then you can get credit too.

519
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,720
It's possible.

520
00:35:23,879 --> 00:35:24,879
Confucius says,

521
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:28,999
"Those who are born with
understanding are the best."

522
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,759
"Those who learn

523
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,639
to understand

524
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:34,560
are the second best."

525
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,720
Tou Tou is much easier to teach

526
00:35:36,999 --> 00:35:40,840
compare to someone
as knowledgeable as you.

527
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,760
Mr Ren,

528
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,200
I have a question.

529
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:55,200
Do you think

530
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,040
it can be believed that

531
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,080
Sun Si Miao lived to be 140 years old?

532
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,720
You're here to learn about life.

533
00:36:04,879 --> 00:36:07,240
Is this the purpose
you learn about life?

534
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,760
You're here to learn

535
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:12,520
about life, aren't you?

536
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,359
The average life expectancy
of my family is about 40 years.

537
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:19,599
I'm now

538
00:36:20,799 --> 00:36:22,399
not far from that time.

539
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,759
That's why
you're afraid to have a relationship

540
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:26,839
and get married.

541
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,399
I don't dare to have a child.

542
00:36:35,799 --> 00:36:36,920
I'm scared

543
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,599
I'll leave him

544
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:40,120
all alone

545
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,399
when I'm gone.

546
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,280
Do you feel lonely?

547
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:57,280
Well, recently

548
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,799
I have a new understanding of longevity.

549
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,480
Longevity

550
00:37:04,359 --> 00:37:05,680
is not how long

551
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,319
we actually live.

552
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,720
Let's say you live for a hundred years

553
00:37:11,399 --> 00:37:12,399
and you start to get sick

554
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:14,079
when you are 60 years old,

555
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:15,359
that's not longevity,

556
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:17,440
but it's a long pain.

557
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:21,159
If we can live to a hundred years
in good health

558
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:24,159
this is a good thing.

559
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,280
What if we can't live to be a hundred?

560
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,520
As you can see,

561
00:37:32,399 --> 00:37:34,960
Zhang Zhong Jing

562
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,240
didn't live a long life.

563
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:37,599
He lived into his sixties.

564
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,280
But in my opinion,

565
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,599
he had longevity.

566
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,960
A man's longevity

567
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:45,640
doesn't depend on

568
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,040
the actual time he lives.

569
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,240
One's real longevity
is about his mind and character.

570
00:37:53,879 --> 00:37:55,279
Many people still remember him,

571
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:56,720
and commemorate him now,

572
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,520
it means he's not dead.

573
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:03,680
Yang, I don't think

574
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,319
you're alone.

575
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,760
Your family is watching you from heaven.

576
00:38:13,159 --> 00:38:15,959
If they see
you can't afford to let go of this,

577
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,440
they won't rest in peace.

578
00:38:19,879 --> 00:38:21,440
If I were your mother,

579
00:38:21,639 --> 00:38:23,359
seeing how tangled

580
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,760
your daily life is,

581
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:26,159
I wouldn't feel at ease.

582
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,760
Here's something for you.

583
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,760
Money box.

584
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,920
Why is this full?

585
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,200
Money box

586
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:55,960
will then be shattered
once the money is stuffed.

587
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,159
This is the process of accumulation.

588
00:38:58,639 --> 00:38:59,639
It's a

589
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,200
highly motivating

590
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,640
and exciting process.

591
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,760
But on the other hand,

592
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,599
if it's full,

593
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,280
it never escapes

594
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,839
from being shattered.

595
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,079
That's how life is.

596
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,000
You only focus to accumulate,

597
00:39:16,879 --> 00:39:18,040
but you don't evacuate

598
00:39:18,399 --> 00:39:19,399
and apply.

599
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:21,760
It's sure to be shattered.

600
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:25,159
There is an in and an out,

601
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,960
a Yin and a Yang, that's the way.

602
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,240
Hence, I'm giving it to you.

603
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,799
It's also an assignment for you.

604
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:47,440
This is all you've got in it.

605
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:51,760
You have to know

606
00:39:52,799 --> 00:39:53,839
how to apply it.

607
00:39:54,639 --> 00:39:55,639
If one day

608
00:39:56,639 --> 00:39:59,359
you can take
the initiative to help others,

609
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,440
I'll take out one yuan

610
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,040
from this money box.

611
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,319
When it's empty,

612
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,599
I will take you as my disciple.

613
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:27,680
-Jian Xi.
-Ms Song.

614
00:40:29,879 --> 00:40:32,200
Has your appetite improved recently?

615
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Much better.

616
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,440
The medicine is quite good, isn't it?

617
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:38,119
That's great.

618
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,559
Then you'll have to
continue taking the medication

619
00:40:39,639 --> 00:40:41,680
we prescribed to you for some time.

620
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,920
Zhu Xia.

621
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,680
-Are you still looking for a tile?
-Yes.

622
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:53,440
There's a lot of information out there,
but it's unreliable.

623
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:57,680
We will soon be providing free
consultations in the suburbs.

624
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:01,119
The possibility of obtaining

625
00:41:02,399 --> 00:41:04,960
centuries-old tiles

626
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,280
in remote mountain areas is greater.

627
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,360
I'll keep an eye out for you then.

628
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,799
Okay, thank you, Ms Song.

629
00:41:10,399 --> 00:41:11,399
You're welcome.

630
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,160
Get more exposure to the sunlight.

631
00:41:15,713 --> 00:41:16,993
Let's go ahead.

632
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:28,720
Hello.

633
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,040
I'd like to rent a
two-bedroom apartment.

634
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,240
Preferably with lift access
and close to the metro.

635
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,240
Budget...

636
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,760
My budget is around 6,000 yuan.

637
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
The sooner, the better.

638
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:44,000
Yes, I am available to view houses
after work on weekdays.

639
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,680
Okay.

640
00:41:47,159 --> 00:41:49,040
Thank you.

641
00:41:51,419 --> 00:41:53,359
Are you really
going to move out with Meng Meng?

642
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,640
I am up against my mum this time.

643
00:41:58,119 --> 00:41:59,119
That's not right.

644
00:41:59,639 --> 00:42:02,079
You're against your mum
because of Meng Meng.

645
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,480
Two years later, you don't
even know where Meng Meng is.

646
00:42:05,079 --> 00:42:07,599
You still have to pass on
your family's legacy.

647
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,040
Are you going to leave your
parents and grandparents behind?

648
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,440
It won't happen.

649
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:15,574
You haven't got a clue about my mum.

650
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:16,840
She will never fall out with me.

651
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:18,359
After a while,

652
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,559
this problem will be solved.

653
00:42:27,079 --> 00:42:29,079
Have you fallen in love with Meng Meng?

654
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,023
What a load of nonsense.

655
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,046
(The prescriptions
and remedies used in this drama)

656
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:39,623
(are referenced from relevant
traditional Chinese medicine books)

657
00:42:39,647 --> 00:42:41,200
