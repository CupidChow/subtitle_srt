00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,477
(Qingyixuan Antiques Store)

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,640
You don't want
to do business with us, do you?

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,920
Do you know you're embezzling assets?

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,360
It's hard for me too.

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,460
It's...
I've been scolding him for one morning.

6
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,160
Who did you sell to?
Go and get it back.

7
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,506
The main problem is that
I don't know who I sold it to.

8
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:19,670
He's not a regular customer.

9
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:24,720
How about the CCTV?

10
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,320
It's already broken,
merely for display purposes.

11
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,840
Not me.

12
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,880
Yeah, right.

13
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,800
No, it's really...

14
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,757
It has nothing to do with me.
Isn't that right, boss?

15
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,840
I'm...

16
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,960
Boss.

17
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,240
Get your staff to check it out.

18
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,960
You have to get it back.

19
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,597
You are truly black-hearted.

20
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,240
Just 100,000 yuan. You're...

21
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,757
-I sold it.
-You're really...

22
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,200
I don't want to comment on you.

23
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,840
Where is the Chenpi water
that I asked you to soak up for me?

24
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,880
I beg your pardon.

25
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,040
What's wrong with you?

26
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,200
Chenpi...

27
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,080
You're so distracted.

28
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,320
Xin Zheng,

29
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,120
our son's pendant

30
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,960
is really gone this time.

31
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,480
It's gone this time?

32
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,880
How about the previous times?

33
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,320
Well...

34
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,960
I don't know.

35
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,560
Where is your agarwood pendant?

36
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,560
Where did you go yesterday?

37
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,400
I don't know.

38
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,320
Don't you know where you've been?

39
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,040
I'm talking to you.

40
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,120
Ren Tian Zhen.

41
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,760
You are almost 28 years old.

42
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,680
When will you be able
to live like a human being?

43
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,037
Do you know how precious
that pendant means to you?

44
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,597
That's the expectation of our
several generations of family for you!

45
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,680
Xin Zheng.

46
00:02:50,713 --> 00:02:52,926
-Mum.
-Can't you talk nicely?

47
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,200
Explain to your grandma!

48
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,120
This is not the first time, right?

49
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,480
Where did you go yesterday?

50
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,120
Be honest!

51
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,480
Xin Zheng.

52
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,040
Be patient when
you're educating your son.

53
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,960
Give him some time to grow.

54
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,760
Everyone's point of enlightenment

55
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,320
is different.

56
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,120
There are not many wunderkinder like you

57
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,320
who have been
persistent in their ambition.

58
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,120
I'd rather Tian Zhen

59
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,120
be warming the bench for ten years.

60
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,560
In the end, he will be a late bloomer.

61
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,840
Master,

62
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,200
can I beg you for one thing?

63
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,120
When I teach my son,
please don't protect him.

64
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,320
I don't expect him

65
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,480
to be a late bloomer anymore.

66
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,040
I'm afraid he's useless.

67
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,760
He is my only son.

68
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,320
I hope
you'll be honest with your parents.

69
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,200
To be an honest man!

70
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,517
Your dad is right.

71
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,800
Tell the truth

72
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,117
and admit your mistake.

73
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,117
From now on,
you won't leave anything behind.

74
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,957
Mum, it's not a matter
of leaving things behind.

75
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,120
You say that you lecture your child,

76
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,400
but you don't even know how old I am.

77
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:15,957
I'm 25 years old this year,

78
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,200
I'm not 28 years old.

79
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,000
You either ignore me or lecture me.

80
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,160
There is no place for me
in your lofty ideals

81
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,597
of teaching, nurturing people,

82
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,040
and carrying on the tradition.

83
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,480
What's up?

84
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,600
I took his pendant.

85
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,160
What are you doing with his pendant?

86
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,280
I took it to the pawn shop and sold it.

87
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,200
I need money recently.

88
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,600
What do you do with the money?

89
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,080
When I worked as
a delivery rider, I was

90
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,637
playing poker with them.

91
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,720
And then

92
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,797
I owed them a lot of money.

93
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,077
I thought that pendant

94
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,597
was worth a lot of money.

95
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,680
Therefore, I

96
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,320
took it.

97
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,960
Master, I've been evil again.

98
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,117
I'm sorry.

99
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,277
Why don't you punish me?

100
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,840
I'll find a way
to redeem that pendant by then, can I?

101
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,200
What a reckless act!

102
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,040
Get out and get into a horse stance!

103
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,000
You scared me out of my wits!

104
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,557
Take this to Tou Tou.

105
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,760
No one can squat like this for a day.

106
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,320
No need, Sun Tou Tou is very tricky.

107
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,640
It's true if you say she would
play tricks back in the day.

108
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,760
But now,

109
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,760
she can really squat
like this for a day.

110
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,720
Give it to her.

111
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,480
She won't take it
if I'm the one who gives her.

112
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,997
What are you doing?

113
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,077
You can sit for a while
if you are tired.

114
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:20,957
I'll cover for you.

115
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,477
I'm not tired at all.

116
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,480
Hurry up and stay aside.

117
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,557
Can you?

118
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,640
I can do it.

119
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,480
Do you think you're Wonder Woman?

120
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,880
If you keep squatting like this,
your thighs can't take it.

121
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,040
Don't be stubborn.
Can't I try it?

122
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,119
Go aside.

123
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,640
Go aside.

124
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,480
I'm with you.

125
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,320
Are you an idiot?

126
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,677
If your dad sees it, he will know
I'm taking the fall for you.

127
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,320
Then my drama just now will be wasted.

128
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,040
Can you get in?

129
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,200
Do you think my dad doesn't know?

130
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,040
You can assume
I'm practicing next to you.

131
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,560
I won't let you practice alone.

132
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,320
If I practiced well, it's good to
improve the skill of observing.

133
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,120
Tou Tou

134
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,960
is getting calmer.

135
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,040
She has squatted for so long
without rest.

136
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,680
It's a bit sunny.

137
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,040
I'm afraid

138
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,680
she will be dehydrated later.

139
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,960
Tian Zhen is squatting
together with her as well.

140
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,480
How heavy can you lift?

141
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,480
55 kilograms.

142
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,280
All right.

143
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,360
That's okay.

144
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,160
You go in and take some rest.

145
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,680
If I collapse later,
you can carry me into the house.

146
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,840
I tell you to eat less before this.

147
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,840
What if I can't carry you later?

148
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,600
What does it have to do
with how much I eat?

149
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,600
Just drag me like a dead dog.

150
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,520
I suppose you know
how to drag me in, right?

151
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,240
Xin Zheng,

152
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,037
don't be angry.

153
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,037
Look at them.

154
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,360
Aren't they apologising to you
in a different way?

155
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,597
You know where your son's pendant is,

156
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,120
don't you?

157
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,680
You and your son

158
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,480
have a tacit understanding.

159
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,600
Am I right?

160
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:28,840
He used to travel every year.

161
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,600
Since you nagged him,

162
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,160
and let him fend for himself,

163
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,120
don't spend our money,

164
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,120
since then,
he started to leave things behind.

165
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,240
Is that my fault?

166
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,840
That's not what I meant.

167
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,877
But our son was right too.

168
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,680
You don't even know how old he is.

169
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,120
You only know how to scold him.

170
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,160
Let me tell you,

171
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,600
a good child grows with praises.

172
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,200
Did I scold him wrongly?

173
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,720
He spends money like water.

174
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,160
He did not even know
how hard his parents earn money.

175
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,197
He didn't do anything bad.

176
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,480
He just went on a trip, didn't he?

177
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,520
To read great books
and do great travels.

178
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,520
Both knowledge and conduct
must be unified.

179
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,040
I can tell.

180
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,597
The older and younger
members of the family

181
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,360
are all covering up and condoning him.

182
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,520
You should say that

183
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,600
to the elders

184
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,120
in person.

185
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,920
But then again,

186
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,520
you said that

187
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,520
our son didn't tell the truth.

188
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,840
You should seriously

189
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,520
reflect on yourself too.

190
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,120
You always say,

191
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,480
"Turn inward and examine yourself when
you encounter difficulties in life."

192
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,600
Our son was just

193
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,920
going on a trip,

194
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,280
wasn't he?

195
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,480
When he travelled,

196
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,600
you called him a dude

197
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,240
who's not aware of the hardships.

198
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,517
You can't just let him
run off to work in the field

199
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,077
whenever he's free
like you did when you were a kid.

200
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,120
Moreover, we don't have
any field at home, do we?

201
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,680
It's not like you don't know
how dignified your son is.

202
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,120
You always scold him,

203
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,520
will he dare to tell you
the truth in the future?

204
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,120
It means it is my fault again.

205
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,480
It's not like that.

206
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,520
It's my fault.

207
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,240
It's my fault.

208
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,480
How can you both be at fault?

209
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,520
I think I should squat there.

210
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,920
Mr Ren.

211
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,840
Professor Ren.

212
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:48,240
Don't be angry after
you've had my cup of apologetic tea,

213
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,680
I'll go and get them back.

214
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,240
I get you some water.

215
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,520
Tou Tou!

216
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,160
Tou Tou has fainted.

217
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,720
I'm okay.

218
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,720
You're too weak.

219
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,720
You prescribe two medications for her.

220
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,360
Let us recuperate her
spleen and stomach first.

221
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,280
After that,
let her drink aconite decoction.

222
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,520
Her body is too cold.

223
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,920
Stop drinking ice water.

224
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,920
Get her a thermos.

225
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,520
Well...

226
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,480
Niece-in-law,

227
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,600
I don't want
a pink-coloured Old Man Cup.

228
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,800
I don't want pink colour, is it okay?

229
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,280
I don't want yellow either.

230
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,800
Is it okay?

231
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,680
I don't want the cup
with a picture, is it okay?

232
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,120
Why did you take on the blame for me?

233
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,080
I'm envious of you.

234
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,840
I don't envy you
for having everything you want.

235
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,680
Well,

236
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,680
every quarrel happened at home

237
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,480
is because of you.

238
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,240
Without you in the future,

239
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,360
these elders must be bored every day.

240
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,160
You're mindless.

241
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,520
You're not answering my question.

242
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,680
Your dad is so angry with you
because of a small mistake you made.

243
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,160
But when I made a big mistake,

244
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,040
your dad can forgive me.

245
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,800
Do you know why?

246
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,600
It's because you are his senior aunt.

247
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,960
It's because your dad loves you.

248
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,840
It's because that's your dad.

249
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,480
He loves you.

250
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,680
He has hope for you.

251
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,800
He won't care too much

252
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,240
whether I'm good or bad.

253
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,520
All he has done for me
is to fulfill his duty.

254
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,720
Well, it has nothing to do with you
taking the punishment for me.

255
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,400
Oh, my grandson,

256
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,160
I'm an orphan.

257
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,480
No one puts hope in me.

258
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,197
But you are different.

259
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,240
You are the hope of your family.

260
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,280
And

261
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,360
I don't want to disappoint my master.

262
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,840
So you have to work hard,

263
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,960
do you understand?

264
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,120
I have high hopes for you.

265
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,360
Do you get me?

266
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,360
But then again,

267
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,800
you are right too.

268
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,277
It's because I like to do the things

269
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,360
that you're doing too.

270
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,720
If I have money,

271
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,960
I will do the same.

272
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,840
But your dad is right too.

273
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,480
So you both are right.

274
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,960
It's perfect for me to take the blame.

275
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,480
Hello.

276
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,280
Tian Zhen, Meng Meng is missing.

277
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,240
Where are you?

278
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,640
What exactly happened?

279
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,520
Why has she suddenly disappeared?

280
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,000
Meng Meng quarrelled with me.

281
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,240
Quarrel?

282
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,680
I invited my family to have
a reunion meal today at noon.

283
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,160
When the guests arrived, Meng Meng
refused to come out of her room,

284
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,520
not even saying hello.

285
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,520
I went in and nagged her.

286
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,880
You...

287
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,640
You have to understand that

288
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,240
Meng Meng is in the situation

289
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,037
that she can't
directly confront strangers

290
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,520
or someone she is unfamiliar with.

291
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,640
They are our relatives

292
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,640
and watched her grow up.

293
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,520
They are not strangers.

294
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,520
I've been out on tour for a long time.

295
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,317
I tried to squeeze in some time

296
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,437
to celebrate a festival with her.

297
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,600
I thought it would cheer her up

298
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,397
if we had more people.

299
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,480
Who knows...

300
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
That's your thought only.

301
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,600
You don't know
what Meng Meng wants, don't you?

302
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,280
We are human beings.

303
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,600
We are not puppets that swing at will.

304
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,000
It's not like we're willing to stay in
whatever position you want to put us in.

305
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,120
Tian Zhen.

306
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,360
I'm sorry.

307
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,840
He doesn't know any better.

308
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,520
It's okay.

309
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,000
It's more important
to look for Meng Meng now.

310
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,520
Yes.

311
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,680
(Fairy Baker)

312
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,520
Excuse me.

313
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,240
Have you seen this girl?

314
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,920
No.

315
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,480
Okay, thank you.

316
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,520
Uncle Zhang.

317
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,760
Did Meng Meng go to your place?

318
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Aunt Zhang.

319
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,360
Did Meng Meng go to your place?

320
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,557
I didn't see her
for more than two hours.

321
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,640
Could you help me look for her?

322
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,640
All right.

323
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,120
-Hello.
-(Have you found Meng Meng?)

324
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,400
No, I didn't.

325
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,840
I searched everywhere I could.

326
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,760
(If we can't find her,
then call the police.)

327
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,120
No, let's not panic.

328
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,917
After quarrelling,
Meng Meng definitely will go to a place

329
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,360
where she feels secure.

330
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,240
So where makes her feel secure?

331
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,400
I know where she is.

332
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,520
How is it? Have you found her?

333
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,240
Have you found her?

334
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,760
No, Grandma.

335
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:10,880
Hasn't Tian Zhen come back yet?

336
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,000
-Not yet.
-How is it?

337
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,120
Why did you come back alone?
You didn't find her?

338
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,160
Have you found her?

339
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,400
Keep your voice down.

340
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,760
Meng Meng.

341
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,640
Meng Meng.

342
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,520
Are you in there?

343
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,880
Come out here, everything is fine.

344
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,120
Everything is fine.

345
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,037
Do you remember that she hid there
on the first day she came?

346
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,360
Well, I'm going to call her parents.

347
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,520
Everything is fine.

348
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,640
It's okay, Meng Meng.

349
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,000
After you make a call,

350
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,520
let's have a family meeting.

351
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Tou Tou.

352
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,480
You bring Meng Meng go into the room.

353
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,880
Don't come out.

354
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,120
Won't I be at the family meeting?

355
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,400
Mum, Meng Meng and Tou Tou
are our family members too.

356
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,880
Let's have a meeting together.

357
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,120
Not allowed!

358
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,120
When I'm talking about family meetings,

359
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,000
I mean people
who are blood-related to us.

360
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,480
Ling Lan,

361
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,520
I know what you're thinking.

362
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,920
What are you going to do?

363
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,360
Xin Zheng,

364
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,360
send Xu Meng away tomorrow.

365
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,640
We can't have
so many girls in our family.

366
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,360
Why?

367
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,880
She has parents,

368
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,560
but she's fostered in our home.

369
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,560
This thing would have been weird.

370
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
What if

371
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,520
something goes wrong,

372
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,120
what should we do?

373
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,880
We are lucky today.

374
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,280
She ran away from her home.

375
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,280
What if she runs away
from our home one day?

376
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,880
How do we explain this to her parents?

377
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,640
She came back on the first day
she lived in her house.

378
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,317
You're pushing her into the fire pit

379
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,880
if you send her back now.

380
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,520
She won't run away
if she stays at our house.

381
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,520
Everyone has their destiny.

382
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,400
Her family relationships are something
she has to deal with on her own.

383
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,720
We can't involve in it.

384
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,880
I disagree.

385
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,840
Meng Meng is my patient.

386
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,600
I have to be responsible for her
to the end.

387
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,920
I won't stop you from
being responsible for her.

388
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,440
But Meng Meng
doesn't have to stay at our home

389
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,280
for you to heal her.

390
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,760
She has her own home.

391
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,120
Then I will rent a house
and stay together with Meng Meng.

392
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,360
How dare you!

393
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,280
You're out of discipline.

394
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,880
And now, Meng Meng's mentality

395
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,197
is unstable

396
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,880
and very immature.

397
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,600
She needs a guardian to accompany her.

398
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,720
Are you her guardian?

399
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,880
Can you take that responsibility?

400
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,240
I'm not discussing this
with you all today.

401
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,240
I'm telling you all my decision.

402
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,000
Then, I will tell you my decision too.

403
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,920
If you send her away,

404
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,240
I will go with her.

405
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,600
What am I going to say?

406
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,360
Nice drawing.

407
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,360
How uncomfortable when
it's pressing against your hand.

408
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,920
Meng Meng, don't be afraid.

409
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,240
I won't hurt you.

410
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,120
Meng Meng, I won't do that.

411
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,920
You were hiding in the dark under
the staircase. Were you frightened?

412
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,360
Don't be afraid.

413
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,840
I'm here.

414
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,240
I will protect you from now on.

415
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,720
Meng Meng.

416
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,240
You're not frightened of me, are you?

417
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,920
Well...

418
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,240
Then you draw first.

419
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,840
Meng Meng.

420
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,400
I sit here.

421
00:27:13,017 --> 00:27:14,077
Don't be afraid.

422
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,480
I'm here to watch you draw.

423
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,120
I'll be with you.

424
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,840
You may draw it.

425
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,160
You may draw it.

426
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,760
That's our son,

427
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,720
why are you angry?

428
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,160
Do I owe you two in my past life?

429
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,200
Why are you torturing me
like this in this life?

430
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,920
None of the elders or
the young are obedient.

431
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,720
Why are you involving me again?

432
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,840
Can't you see

433
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,480
I scold our son every day?

434
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,637
But today I can tell

435
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,720
this kid

436
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,120
can become a great doctor.

437
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,480
Are you happy seeing him
go against me, aren't you?

438
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,640
Narrow-minded.

439
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,280
Narrow-minded.

440
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,760
I don't believe it.

441
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,520
I have been spoiling him
for over 20 years.

442
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,120
I'm going to against him this time.

443
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,240
Does he dare to disown me as his mother?

444
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,600
I'll stay out of

445
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,480
this motherly business.

446
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,360
But I would like to remind you.

447
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,120
A mother fighting with her son...

448
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I won't say anymore.

449
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,400
It's pointless

450
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,480
raising a son.

451
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,840
Look at you.

452
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,480
Keep your mouth shut.

453
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Is this a new foot cloth?

454
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,640
(Qibo Medical Centre)

455
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,317
Tou Tou!

456
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,280
Have the new cups
not been sterilized yet?

457
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,593
Ms Song said
it's for you to use today.

458
00:30:30,706 --> 00:30:32,379
I don't use an Old Man Cup.

459
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,600
No need to sterilize it for me.

460
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,920
Why were you shouting?

461
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,480
How's your foot?

462
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,120
It's much better.

463
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,920
Do you need my wife
to check for you again?

464
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,480
No need. Tian Zhen
already gave me the medicinal wine.

465
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,480
Well,

466
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,840
this time you stumbled into the ravine,

467
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,920
but no one helped you.

468
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,720
What do you think of this phenomenon?

469
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,760
Do we have a trend of snitching here?

470
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,600
Nobody snitches on you.

471
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,920
Actually, everything we do,

472
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,720
God has the ledgers.

473
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,120
Mr Ren,

474
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,120
if you have anything to say,
just say it.

475
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,000
Look at Sun Tou Tou.

476
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,720
Although she has left
our apprentice class,

477
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,640
there are still many students

478
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,720
who wish to bear responsibility for her.

479
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,037
When you stumbled into the ravine,

480
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,840
only Sun Tou Tou

481
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,600
took the initiative to help you.

482
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,640
Other students

483
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,360
didn't dare to touch you.

484
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,360
Maybe Sun Tou Tou doesn't
read as many books as you do,

485
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,120
but she makes friends.

486
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,360
What do you think of this phenomenon?

487
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,920
I think

488
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,360
if a person isn't educated

489
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,720
and doesn't have
any professional skills,

490
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:37,197
he must only be able
to get a foothold in the society

491
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,720
by making connections with people.

492
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,760
In fact, it's the same for us lawyers.

493
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,360
Some people just get acquainted.

494
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,640
But some people

495
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,400
are extremely good at their job.

496
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,400
I'm a technical person.

497
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,277
Some are theoretical

498
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,000
whereas some are practical.

499
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,400
Tou Tou is probably not

500
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,520
as knowledgeable as you.

501
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,360
But she likes to take practical ​action.

502
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,520
Perhaps her sensibility

503
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,160
will exceed you.

504
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,640
Look at the
first sentence of Heart Sutra,

505
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,720
Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva

506
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,840
meditated deeply.

507
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,360
It's not talking about depth.

508
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,600
But it refers to meditating deeply.

509
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,640
Hence, don't look down
on the sweeping monk.

510
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,120
Maybe she'll run ahead of you.

511
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,520
Therefore, you'd rather
take her as a disciple

512
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,920
and rejected me, right?

513
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:37,077
That's why you're waiting
for her to achieve her goal,

514
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,000
then you can get credit too.

515
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,640
It's possible.

516
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,760
Confucius says,

517
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,880
"Those who are born with
understanding are the best."

518
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,640
"Those who learn

519
00:33:56,253 --> 00:33:57,413
to understand

520
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,440
are the second best."

521
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,640
Tou Tou is much easier to teach

522
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:05,760
compare to someone
as knowledgeable as you.

523
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:14,680
Mr Ren,

524
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,120
I have a question.

525
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,120
Do you think

526
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,960
it can be believed that

527
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,000
Sun Si Miao lived to be 140 years old?

528
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,640
You're here to learn about life.

529
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,160
Is this the purpose
you learn about life?

530
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,680
You're here to learn

531
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,440
about life, aren't you?

532
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,240
The average life expectancy
of my family is about 40 years.

533
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,480
I'm now

534
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,280
not far from that time.

535
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,637
That's why
you're afraid to have a relationship

536
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,720
and get married.

537
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,280
I don't dare to have a child.

538
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,840
I'm scared

539
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,480
I'll leave him

540
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,037
all alone

541
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,280
when I'm gone.

542
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,200
Do you feel lonely?

543
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,200
Well, recently

544
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,680
I have a new understanding of longevity.

545
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,400
Longevity

546
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,600
is not how long

547
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,200
we actually live.

548
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,640
Let's say you live for a hundred years

549
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,280
and you start to get sick

550
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,957
when you are 60 years old,

551
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,240
that's not longevity,

552
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,360
but it's a long pain.

553
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,040
If we can live to a hundred years
in good health

554
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,040
this is a good thing.

555
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,200
What if we can't live to be a hundred?

556
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,440
As you can see,

557
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,880
Zhang Zhong Jing

558
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,160
didn't live a long life.

559
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,480
He lived into his sixties.

560
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,200
But in my opinion,

561
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,480
he had longevity.

562
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,880
A man's longevity

563
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,557
doesn't depend on

564
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,960
the actual time he lives.

565
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:18,160
One's real longevity
is about his mind and character.

566
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,157
Many people still remember him,

567
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,640
and commemorate him now,

568
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,440
it means he's not dead.

569
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,597
Yang, I don't think

570
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,200
you're alone.

571
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,680
Your family is watching you from heaven.

572
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,840
If they see
you can't afford to let go of this,

573
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,360
they won't rest in peace.

574
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,360
If I were your mother,

575
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,240
seeing how tangled

576
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,680
your daily life is,

577
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,040
I wouldn't feel at ease.

578
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,680
Here's something for you.

579
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,680
Money box.

580
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,840
Why is this full?

581
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,120
Money box

582
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,880
will then be shattered
once the money is stuffed.

583
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,040
This is the process of accumulation.

584
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,520
It's a

585
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,117
highly motivating

586
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,557
and exciting process.

587
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,680
But on the other hand,

588
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,480
if it's full,

589
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,200
it never escapes

590
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,720
from being shattered.

591
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,960
That's how life is.

592
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,920
You only focus to accumulate,

593
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,960
but you don't evacuate

594
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,280
and apply.

595
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,680
It's sure to be shattered.

596
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,040
There is an in and an out,

597
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,880
a Yin and a Yang, that's the way.

598
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,160
Hence, I'm giving it to you.

599
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,680
It's also an assignment for you.

600
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:12,360
This is all you've got in it.

601
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,680
You have to know

602
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,720
how to apply it.

603
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,520
If one day

604
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:24,240
you can take
the initiative to help others,

605
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,360
I'll take out one yuan

606
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,960
from this money box.

607
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,200
When it's empty,

608
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,480
I will take you as my disciple.

609
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,600
-Jian Xi.
-Ms Song.

610
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:57,120
Has your appetite improved recently?

611
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,920
Much better.

612
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,360
The medicine is quite good, isn't it?

613
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
That's great.

614
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,437
Then you'll have to
continue taking the medication

615
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,600
we prescribed to you for some time.

616
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,840
Zhu Xia.

617
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,600
-Are you still looking for a tile?
-Yes.

618
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,360
There's a lot of information out there,
but it's unreliable.

619
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:22,600
We will soon be providing free
consultations in the suburbs.

620
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,000
The possibility of obtaining

621
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,877
centuries-old tiles

622
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,200
in remote mountain areas is greater.

623
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,277
I'll keep an eye out for you then.

624
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,680
Okay, thank you, Ms Song.

625
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,280
You're welcome.

626
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,080
Get more exposure to the sunlight.

627
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,880
Let's go ahead.

628
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,640
Hello.

629
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,960
I'd like to rent a
two-bedroom apartment.

630
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:59,160
Preferably with lift access
and close to the metro.

631
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,160
Budget...

632
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,680
My budget is around 6,000 yuan.

633
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,920
The sooner, the better.

634
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,920
Yes, I am available to view houses
after work on weekdays.

635
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,600
Okay.

636
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,960
Thank you.

637
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,240
Are you really
going to move out with Meng Meng?

638
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,560
I am up against my mum this time.

639
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
That's not right.

640
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,960
You're against your mum
because of Meng Meng.

641
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,400
Two years later, you don't
even know where Meng Meng is.

642
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,480
You still have to pass on
your family's legacy.

643
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,960
Are you going to leave your
parents and grandparents behind?

644
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,360
It won't happen.

645
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,477
You haven't got a clue about my mum.

646
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,760
She will never fall out with me.

647
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,240
After a while,

648
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,440
this problem will be solved.

649
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,066
Have you fallen in love with Meng Meng?

650
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,020
What a load of nonsense.

651
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,880
(The prescriptions
and remedies used in this drama)

652
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,477
(are referenced from relevant
traditional Chinese medicine books)

653
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,120
