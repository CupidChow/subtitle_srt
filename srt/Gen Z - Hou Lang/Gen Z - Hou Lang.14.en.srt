(Qibo Medical Centre)

2
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,079
This is amazing.

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,211
This is truly amazing.

4
00:00:16,878 --> 00:00:17,716
Try and move around.

5
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,285
See if it still hurts.

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,000
Look, I'm fine.

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,640
Ms Dong, thank you.

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,077
-Thank you.
-Don't mention it.

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,397
Ms Dong, can you teach me
what you did just now?

10
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,917
Many of my colleagues
have waist issues.

11
00:00:29,035 --> 00:00:30,796
I can give them a massage
after you teach me that technique.

12
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,240
-Yes.
-I'm afraid I cannot teach you yet.

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,640
You quit the apprentice class.

14
00:00:35,853 --> 00:00:38,093
Besides, you're lagging in progress.

15
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,877
-Tou Tou, so, you were a student here?
-Stop it.

16
00:00:42,973 --> 00:00:45,933
If so, why did you become
a delivery rider?

17
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,880
Ms Dong is amazing.

18
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,477
You must learn from her

19
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,597
and master her technique.

20
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,757
That way, we can find you

21
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,880
if we have waist issues in the future.

22
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,440
Do you wish to learn then?

23
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,359
I do.

24
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,799
I do wish to learn.

25
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,000
But I think Master

26
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,600
won't accept me.

27
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,160
Whether your master

28
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,637
wants to teach you or not

29
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,719
depends on him.

30
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,077
Whether you wish to learn or not

31
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,077
-depends on you.
-That's right.

32
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,720
Faith will move mountains.

33
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,357
You should

34
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,920
apologise to your master

35
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,160
and beg for his forgiveness.

36
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,640
Yes. Ms Dong is right.

37
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,146
You should
apologise to your master.

38
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,400
Mister!

39
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,279
Mister, look!

40
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,717
My waist is fine now.

41
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,637
Mister,

42
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,557
listen.

43
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,557
Tou Tou

44
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,357
wishes to study TCM.

45
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,677
And, she's very hard-working.

46
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,560
She went to study straight away
and couldn't even be bothered with

47
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,080
her greasy face

48
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,560
after making deliveries.

49
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,357
The dorm environment isn't the best too.

50
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,360
Her co-workers play poker
and brag all day long.

51
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,717
Even so, she wasn't affected.

52
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,997
She writes with a brush every day.

53
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,077
She completes one essay per day.

54
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,557
She never stops no matter

55
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,639
how tired or busy she is.

56
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,159
She's very hard-working.

57
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,559
I'm serious.

58
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,480
Go now.

59
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,719
Go now.

60
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,359
Apologise to him.

61
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,160
-Hurry.
-Master.

62
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,159
Thank you.

63
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Take care.

64
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,440
Apologise to him.

65
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,717
You don't understand.
Stop it.

66
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,799
You...

67
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,440
This lass is something else.

68
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,477
Ms Dong,

69
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,120
thank you for today.

70
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,837
As for the fee,

71
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,678
I've already told Master.

72
00:02:42,761 --> 00:02:44,520
I'll give it to him later.

73
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,677
If there's nothing else,

74
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,840
we'll leave first.

75
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,957
-Okay.
-Thank you, Ms Dong.

76
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,997
-Where's your jacket?
-Here.

77
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,079
It's here.

78
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,277
We'll make a move first.

79
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,359
Thank you.

80
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,477
Thank you so much.

81
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,357
Don't mention it.

82
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,439
Thank you.

83
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,717
Let's go.

84
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,677
Wait.

85
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,880
Let me remind you again.

86
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,317
Although I've restored your spine
to its original position,

87
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,796
you need some time
before the muscles can recover.

88
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,960
If you have time,
give him a gentle rub

89
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,717
along his spine

90
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,120
every day.

91
00:03:11,433 --> 00:03:13,273
If any of his muscles feel tense,

92
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,599
you can

93
00:03:14,858 --> 00:03:16,055
massage it gently

94
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:17,979
and help them to release tension.

95
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,040
-Okay.
-I have a bottle of ointment here.

96
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,957
-Use it on him
-I'm fine now.

97
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,120
tomorrow.

98
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,440
It's fine. Just take it.

99
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,957
Thank you, Ms Dong.

100
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,400
-Thank you, Ms Dong.
-You're welcome.

101
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,357
-Don't mention it.
-We'll make a move now.

102
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,277
Okay.

103
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,238
Thank you, Ms Dong.

104
00:03:31,321 --> 00:03:32,637
-Don't mention it.
-Goodbye.

105
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,720
Goodbye.

106
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,760
-Thank you, Ms Dong.
-Don't mention it.

107
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,760
Mum, be careful.

108
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,479
Mum,

109
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,040
after this trip,

110
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,760
I'll run out of rest days.

111
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,480
Next time, you have to ask my brother
to bring you here.

112
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,200
We can talk about that after this trip.

113
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:08,997
I don't even know

114
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,960
if I can survive until the next trip.

115
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,599
Mum,

116
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,320
don't say such inauspicious words.

117
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,277
I'm forsaking my career
just to keep you company.

118
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,040
You shouldn't let my effort
go down the drain.

119
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,720
I don't wish to be in debt too.

120
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,760
I'll try to repay

121
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,560
as much of my debt

122
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,200
as I can before I die.

123
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,160
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

124
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,560
-Flush.
-Next.

125
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,638
-Do it.
-Ace!

126
00:05:03,721 --> 00:05:05,557
He's done for.

127
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,397
Shuffle the cards.

128
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,479
Shuffle the cards.

129
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,440
-Come and join us.
-Come on.

130
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,040
Ms Dong did this, right?

131
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,520
Not really.

132
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,117
Ms Dong is truly amazing.

133
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,080
She cured me in seconds.

134
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,280
Where else can you
get a teacher like that?

135
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,480
I think Ms Dong wants
to take you as her student.

136
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,517
If you find her,

137
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,437
and if you do inherit

138
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,398
her skills,

139
00:05:35,481 --> 00:05:37,120
you'll be able to help
many people in the future.

140
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,477
I hurt Master's heart.

141
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,760
Master won't take me back.

142
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,560
And, Ms Dong is Master's good friend.

143
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,757
If Master doesn't take me back,

144
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,040
Ms Dong won't take me
under her wing too.

145
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,158
Silly girl,

146
00:05:50,241 --> 00:05:52,760
just find your master and tell him
to take you back.

147
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,319
It's been so many years.

148
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,560
I've got into contact with many people
after making deliveries.

149
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,357
I can tell who's good or bad

150
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,640
in one go.

151
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,440
Your master

152
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,640
might look fierce,

153
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,880
but he's kind.

154
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,880
He told you to pay my fee for me.

155
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,880
In the end, he forgot about it.

156
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,397
I'll definitely pay him back.

157
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,238
Don't worry.

158
00:06:19,321 --> 00:06:20,480
Why are you trying to
return the money to him?

159
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,557
If you study under him,

160
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,880
you'll be doing him a favour.

161
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,879
This is interesting.

162
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,397
You didn't believe

163
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,479
that I was a TCM student
when I told you.

164
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,320
(Qibo Medical Centre)

165
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,880
I'll never be good at this.

166
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,200
Calm down. You'll recover eventually.

167
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,600
Xia is back.

168
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,639
What do you think?

169
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,600
Did you find the tile?

170
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,520
Did you find it or not?

171
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,677
The first house

172
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,400
isn't even 300 years old.

173
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,760
Regarding the second house...

174
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,559
How is it?

175
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,757
The house is 350 years old.

176
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,320
The house owner could confirm it.

177
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,437
Isn't that good?

178
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,519
What about the tile?

179
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,237
But now,

180
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,720
I've encountered some issues.

181
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,840
Although this house

182
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,680
is over 300 years old,

183
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,240
they renovate it

184
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,560
once every decade.

185
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,999
Tell me then.

186
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,960
Do you think these tiles
are 300 years old then?

187
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,119
This one?

188
00:07:28,613 --> 00:07:29,797
This looks like...

189
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,437
Tian Zhen, come here.

190
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,640
Help me analyse it.

191
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,557
Look.

192
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,597
This house

193
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,120
is 300 years old.

194
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,440
But they renovate it once every decade.

195
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,120
So, do you think this tile

196
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,960
is 300 years old?

197
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,600
I know it's useless.

198
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,119
This is nothing.

199
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,357
If I can't find it this time,

200
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,397
I'll find it next time, right?

201
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,160
Our country is vast.

202
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,997
I don't believe that I can't find
a 300-year-old tile.

203
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,079
Precisely.

204
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,360
I'll help you to inquire about it.

205
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,760
In our hometown, which is a village,

206
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,520
they have whitewashed

207
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,877
houses and grey tiles.

208
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,997
Houses that go on

209
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,037
magazine covers.

210
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,117
I'll also tell them

211
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,960
to ask if there are any
300-year-old houses around.

212
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,880
If so, do they renovate it

213
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,760
once every ten years too?

214
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,080
All these years,

215
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,357
the tourism industry

216
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,680
is developing pretty rapidly.

217
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,480
I think it might be
one of the reasons too.

218
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,997
However, there are houses

219
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,680
that are nicely preserved,

220
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,117
which were bought by people.

221
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,317
I'll ask them

222
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,400
if they have any tiles like that.

223
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,077
I'll thank you in advance then.

224
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,117
-Thank you.
-It's what I should do.

225
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,640
-Tian Zhen.
-What's the matter?

226
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,559
Tou Tou is in trouble.

227
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,199
What happened?

228
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,439
Look.

229
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,837
You shouldn't do this.

230
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,000
Just return it to her.

231
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,917
-She's panicking!
-I didn't receive anything!

232
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,120
I saw nothing!

233
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,877
She didn't

234
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,560
deliver it to me personally!

235
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,077
She said she delivered it

236
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,038
to your doorstep.

237
00:09:07,121 --> 00:09:09,280
Maybe you took it inside by accident.

238
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,157
No means no.

239
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,078
How could that be?

240
00:09:12,161 --> 00:09:13,360
She's so annoying.

241
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,600
Miss, I'm begging you here.

242
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,960
I'm truly begging you here.

243
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,997
Why don't you search your house again?

244
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,997
It's a wedding ring. It's the wedding
ring of your neighbour upstairs.

245
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,637
I can't afford to lose it.

246
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,400
Why don't you search again?

247
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,077
You're blaming me for it now?

248
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,837
You sent it to the wrong address.

249
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,160
What has this got to do with me?

250
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,280
You should compensate her for it!

251
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,920
Do you think you can afford it?

252
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,037
I didn't see it!

253
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,720
I wasn't at home too!

254
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,280
Dad, were you looking for me?

255
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,197
Can you show me that video

256
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,400
with your phone?

257
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,479
Yeah.

258
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,917
(You should return it to her.)

259
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,837
(She's panicking.)

260
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,720
(I didn't receive it! I saw nothing!)

261
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,397
(She didn't deliver it)

262
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,160
(to me personally.)

263
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,600
(She said she delivered it
to your doorstep.)

264
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,397
(Maybe you took it inside by accident.)

265
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,717
Do you know how much it costs?

266
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,677
Why is she kneeling?

267
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,757
(I'm begging you!)

268
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,120
(I'm begging you here.)

269
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,037
(Why don't you search your room again?)

270
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,160
Doesn't she know that she shouldn't
kneel as my successor?

271
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,197
She's not even a student now.

272
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,397
How could you call her your successor?

273
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,000
She can choose not to be my student.

274
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,277
However, she's the successor
of the Jiang family's acupuncture sect.

275
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,760
You can't deny that, right?

276
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,679
How much does it cost?

277
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,637
It's not expensive. A diamond ring
costs over 30,000 yuan.

278
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,720
Mainly, it's a wedding ring.
She couldn't get another one in time.

279
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,637
(It's a wedding ring.)

280
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,717
(It's the wedding ring
of your neighbour upstairs.)

281
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,400
(I can't afford to lose it.)

282
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,517
She's so short-tempered.

283
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,320
She can't even deliver her goods
to the right person.

284
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,080
It's not entirely her fault.

285
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,240
The address was wrong.

286
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,517
Initially, it was 3003.

287
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,477
They wrote 303.

288
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,480
She sent it to the third floor
since there was one zero less.

289
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,640
Why isn't she admitting it then?

290
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,637
Could it be

291
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,719
that the garbage collector

292
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,040
took it away?

293
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,840
You guys should check out the junkyard.

294
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,077
We've checked the surveillance camera

295
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,240
for the entrance and exit.

296
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,520
The garbage collector didn't come today.

297
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,600
It's an express delivery.

298
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,397
She has to ask for collection code.

299
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,040
I don't have it!

300
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,240
How could she leave it at the door?

301
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,520
It's my fault.

302
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,840
I...
I was on my way home.

303
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,517
I told her to leave it at the door.

304
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,000
After that, I gave her the code.

305
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,200
I didn't expect her to send it
to the wrong floor.

306
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,680
If so, you should look for the sender.

307
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,400
They wrote the wrong address.

308
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,160
But I'm getting married tomorrow!

309
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,599
What?

310
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,157
If so, that means God

311
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,440
doesn't want you to get married.

312
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,557
Hey, mind your words.

313
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,639
How could you say that?

314
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,800
What's going on?

315
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,720
Why are you guys here?

316
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,219
And you! Why are you filming me?

317
00:11:41,303 --> 00:11:42,356
So what if I'm filming you?

318
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,326
Listen!
Stop filming!

319
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,440
Have you lost your mind?

320
00:11:45,521 --> 00:11:46,640
Stop filming me!

321
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,277
There should be a surveillance camera

322
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,840
above the stairs.

323
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,239
Yeah.

324
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,877
Meng Meng told me that they installed
a camera in their peephole.

325
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,160
I'll ask her neighbour if they have one.

326
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,600
Over here.

327
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,480
I didn't.

328
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,957
I didn't see it.

329
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,157
How can I return it to her?

330
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,637
What are you guys doing?

331
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,360
Why are you guys surrounding me?

332
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,637
I told you already! I don't have it!

333
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,720
Unit 302, is someone home?

334
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,797
-Is someone there?
-Get up.

335
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,800
Did you install a camera
in the peephole?

336
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,720
Why didn't I think of it?

337
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,597
I'll contact the owner of
Unit 302 immediately.

338
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,837
I'll tell him to come over immediately.

339
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,637
You guys should go back.

340
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,240
Don't gather here.
Return to what you were doing.

341
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:42,837
Go back.

342
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,919
Please go back.

343
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,317
Miss, you should go back too.

344
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,277
You should get up first.

345
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,480
Here, get up.

346
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,159
Thank you.

347
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,360
Be careful.

348
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,160
What about this? You guys
can wait downstairs.

349
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,279
We'll deal with this.

350
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,397
Okay, thank you.

351
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,479
Thank you for the trouble.

352
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,717
Miss, I just checked

353
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,160
the peephole from
the unit opposite yours.

354
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,200
I'm not sure if they have
installed any surveillance camera.

355
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,559
However, if they have,

356
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,920
we'll know what happened

357
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,239
when the unit owner

358
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,800
retrieves his memory card for us

359
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,999
after half an hour.

360
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,480
You still have time

361
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,119
to search the house again.

362
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,477
See if you have taken the box inside

363
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,800
by accident.

364
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,999
If you take it out now,

365
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,559
it'll be a misunderstanding.

366
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,280
However, if there's evidence,

367
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,640
you'll be convicted of larceny.

368
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,919
You'll face legal punishment.

369
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,077
By the way,

370
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,720
how much did the lady say
her wedding ring cost again?

371
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,917
38,000 yuan.

372
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,917
Look.

373
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It's that expensive.

374
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,717
Sir,

375
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,800
please give me a second.

376
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,560
I'll search my house again.

377
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,160
You see.

378
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,917
I did take it by accident.

379
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,999
This...

380
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,000
I'm truly sorry about this.

381
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,477
Miss,

382
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,680
the issue has been resolved.

383
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,799
She maligned you.

384
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,600
However, this does occur quite often.

385
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,039
Everything's fine now.

386
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,799
You guys should head back now.

387
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,760
-Sorry for the trouble.
-Thank you.

388
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,040
Grandma, which one?

389
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,319
Those two.

390
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,880
-These?
-Yeah.

391
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,839
Mum.

392
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,119
Are you looking for books?

393
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,520
I heard that you met Tou Tou today.

394
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,360
Yeah.

395
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,919
How was she?

396
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,917
She wasn't doing well.

397
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,720
No one will be in a good mood
if they have to kneel like that.

398
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,397
What about the mister
who came along with her?

399
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,480
How's his waist?

400
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,800
I don't know. I didn't care about him.

401
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,279
Xin Zheng,

402
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,240
about Tou Tou,

403
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,757
I think it's unsafe

404
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,277
for a girl like her to live with

405
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,359
a bunch of guys.

406
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,719
Besides,

407
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,520
punishing her for two days
should be enough.

408
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,840
She's still young.

409
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,560
It's common for her to make mistakes.

410
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,640
If she stays outside for a long time,

411
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,517
she'll revert to her wild nature.

412
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,520
It wasn't easy to tame her, you know?

413
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,519
What do you say?

414
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,759
Tian Zhen,

415
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,520
tell Tou Tou to come back

416
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,799
and attend the apprentice class.

417
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,119
Tell her

418
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,317
to apologise to your father.

419
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,317
Tell her

420
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,760
not to repeat her mistake.

421
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,159
You hear me?

422
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,557
Your grandmother was talking to you.

423
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,920
Why didn't you give her any responses?

424
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,760
You're so rude.

425
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,840
I'm giving you a chance
to put what you learned to practice.

426
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,877
I'm willing to let you massage my waist

427
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,600
even though you're terrible at it.

428
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,960
You must've suffered today.

429
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,840
If it were me,

430
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,119
I would've knelt too.

431
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,637
It costs over 30,000 yuan.

432
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,200
We won't be able to compensate them.

433
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,720
I didn't kneel because of the money.

434
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,960
Why did you kneel then?

435
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,160
You're saying as if
you have 30,000 yuan.

436
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,200
You only make five yuan for
each delivery you make.

437
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,960
I just didn't want
her happiness to be affected.

438
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,120
You're willing to kneel for
other people's happiness.

439
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,277
But you're not willing to kneel

440
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,440
for your own happiness.

441
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,278
I think

442
00:17:18,361 --> 00:17:19,760
you should behave
like what you did today.

443
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,640
You should kneel
in front of your master.

444
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,320
You shouldn't get up before he agrees
to take you back as a student.

445
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,479
Did you hear me?

446
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,959
Give me a second.

447
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,920
I don't have time to join you
for practice.

448
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,559
Tou Tou,

449
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,880
Grandma said she missed you.

450
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,960
(She told you to apologise to Dad.)

451
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,120
(You can come back and study medicine.)

452
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,200
Say something.

453
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,480
Tell him that you'll apologise to him.

454
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,200
Hurry, say something.

455
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,559
Did you hear me?

456
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,880
-Hurry.
-Apologise...

457
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,159
Wait.

458
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,839
Got it.

459
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,119
I miss them too.

460
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,040
That's more like it.

461
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,799
I used too much strength.

462
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,519
I'll be using some strength.

463
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,920
That's more like it.

464
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,677
Hey, watch it. It's new.

465
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,957
Don't break it.

466
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:51,838
Be gentle.

467
00:18:51,921 --> 00:18:53,557
Uncle Tao, when did you
get yourself a new bike?

468
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,957
You were not willing to spend money
to see doctors even when you were sick.

469
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,039
Precisely.

470
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,837
It's free.

471
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,117
They held an event
for the new eco-vehicle.

472
00:18:59,200 --> 00:18:59,958
I went to help them out.

473
00:19:00,041 --> 00:19:00,958
I got it from a lucky draw.

474
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:02,040
Get off the bike.

475
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,520
I plan to give it

476
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,717
to Tou Tou.

477
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,917
Why aren't you giving it to us?

478
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,999
Yeah.

479
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,317
She's a girl.

480
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,277
It's already tough enough for her
to work together with guys like her.

481
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,400
-Yeah.
-Besides,

482
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,440
she can begin a new life

483
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,080
after getting this bike.

484
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,117
He's right.

485
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,758
Later,
all of you should keep it a secret.

486
00:19:17,841 --> 00:19:19,317
Let's surprise Tou Tou
when she comes back.

487
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,440
-Okay.
-Don't tell her.

488
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,757
Okay.

489
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,240
(Qibo Medical Centre)

490
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,680
I practised writing every day.

491
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,240
I didn't even skip a single day.

492
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,520
But you don't like TCM.

493
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,680
What's the use of writing them down?

494
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,640
I didn't want to study TCM before this.

495
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,677
But now, I don't know
if I can be a TCM practitioner

496
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,280
even if I wish to study TCM.

497
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,040
Master, I know you're a good person.

498
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,397
Although I don't really get what you say

499
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,680
sometimes,

500
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:21,918
I know

501
00:20:22,001 --> 00:20:23,317
that I won't be led astray

502
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,399
if I follow your advice

503
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,240
and study hard.

504
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,280
I still wish to study under you.

505
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,239
Go now.

506
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,120
Don't tell me she's in trouble?

507
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,800
She's not out yet.

508
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,199
This is bad.

509
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,399
How is it?

510
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,120
Say something. Did he say yes or no?

511
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,399
This is bad.

512
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,760
Go and tell your father

513
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,400
that it isn't Tou Tou's fault alone.

514
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,840
The others are at fault too.

515
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,040
He mustn't just punish her alone.

516
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,519
Think of something.

517
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,077
Yes, everyone is at fault.

518
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,677
We can't just let you
face the music alone.

519
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,760
I'll tell my father about this.

520
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,919
I don't believe I can't resolve this.

521
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,239
Meng Meng!

522
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,800
Meng Meng! I'm sorry!

523
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,277
I was joking with you.

524
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,359
I'm not leaving.

525
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,640
Master allowed me to stay.

526
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:13,040
If so, why did you...

527
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,360
I just shook my head.
I didn't say I was going to leave.

528
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,639
Where are you going?

529
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,840
Didn't you tell me to go?

530
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,037
You should keep your stuff

531
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,160
and get changed.

532
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,520
We have a consultation to attend.

533
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,440
You're lagging in
the hands-on technique class.

534
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,680
Tell your classmates
to give you tuition when you're free.

535
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,920
I can come back now?

536
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:58,997
But I have conditions.

537
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,079
Sure.

538
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,359
I'm fine with any conditions.

539
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,120
Memorise one page of
the classics every day.

540
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,197
Okay.

541
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,997
-I'll test you.
-No problem.

542
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,520
After the renovation is done,

543
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,518
you have to clean up
the classroom in advance.

544
00:23:09,601 --> 00:23:10,880
Okay.

545
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,519
And,

546
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,279
no ripped pants or jeans.

547
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,520
But why?

548
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,520
No bare feet allowed.

549
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,039
Wear your socks.

550
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,639
Okay.

551
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,239
Okay.

552
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,759
Okay.

553
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,679
Go now.

554
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,999
Go where?

555
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,519
Go and get changed.

556
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,879
You're something else.

557
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,519
Everything's fine now.

558
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,400
(As weather turns cold gradually,)

559
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,600
(Cold Dew arrives.)

560
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,280
(Fall brings gold with a hint of white,)

561
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,320
(describing the dew of Fall as white,
it is also known as White Dew.)

562
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:28,840
(White Dew)

563
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,240
Meng Meng, look.

564
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,040
-The scenery is great, right?
-It's so beautiful.

565
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,439
Not bad at all.

566
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,880
Slow down.

567
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,520
Guys, gather around.

568
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,517
Tou Tou,

569
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,599
come here.

570
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,039
Come here.

571
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,800
Leave the pole over there for now.

572
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,680
Guys,

573
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,798
today,

574
00:25:06,881 --> 00:25:09,800
Mr Qiu will teach you guys
about Chinese pharmacology.

575
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,197
(Qiu Jian Xian)

576
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,279
Wait.

577
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,517
I thought we were on holiday?

578
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,040
Why are we still holding lessons here?

579
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,360
Mother Nature is a natural classroom.

580
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,157
Guys,

581
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,280
we shouldn't differentiate
between daily lives

582
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,200
and treating patients. For example,

583
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,077
there's a saying taught by

584
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,117
the natives here.

585
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,197
It's called

586
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,279
"If you're bitten by a snake,"

587
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,317
"the antidote can be found"

588
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,399
"within 100 steps".

589
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,317
It makes perfect sense.

590
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,317
It's because

591
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,280
Yin and Yang are not
two different sides.

592
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,920
It's both sides of the same coin.

593
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,159
For example,

594
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,800
one side of Earth

595
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,120
is facing the sun.

596
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,800
But on the other side,

597
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,240
it must be facing the moon.

598
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,720
One bite of lychee is equal
to three flaming torches.

599
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:54,838
Lychee

600
00:25:54,921 --> 00:25:57,120
is considered a heaty fruit.

601
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,917
There's a popular saying.

602
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,520
To neutralize the heatiness of lychee,

603
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,400
you need the membrane inside its shell.

604
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,037
You need to peel the membrane
and cook it with water.

605
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,240
This way, the heatiness
will be neutralized.

606
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,280
Guys,

607
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,677
when we learn Chinese pharmacology

608
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,880
in the classroom,

609
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,197
it's just like how doctors

610
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,280
dissect bodies in the autopsy room

611
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,640
to understand the human body.

612
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:23,000
Therefore, if we learn Chinese
pharmacology in a natural setting,

613
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,760
we'll be able to apply what we learn.

614
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,280
If you're bitten by a snake,

615
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,240
the antidote can be found
within 100 steps.

616
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,279
I understand now.

617
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,560
It's just like

618
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,197
there's always a McDonald's

619
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,440
beside a KFC.

620
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,797
Am I right?

621
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,837
It's just like the local specialties,

622
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,000
they sell at tourist spots.

623
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,037
-Am I right?
-What is that nonsense?

624
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,317
Tou Tou's crude words

625
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,520
carry fine ideas.

626
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,039
You get me?

627
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,239
Fall in.

628
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,597
Guys,

629
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,720
we can hold a contest today.

630
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,437
Back then, Li Shi Zhen travelled

631
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,677
across mountains and hills
to gather herbs

632
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,640
and compile

633
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
the Compendium of Materia Medica.

634
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,077
You guys know

635
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,517
that dew water can be used as medicine.

636
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,360
So, today, you guys can

637
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,240
travel across the hills

638
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,439
to gather herbs

639
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,520
and train your legs.

640
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,757
You guys can come back

641
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,120
before dinner time.

642
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,800
The person who gathered the most herbs

643
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:22,437
can order the food they want.

644
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,519
What do you think?

645
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,160
TCM preaches

646
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,277
the homology of food and medicine.

647
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,760
For dinner,

648
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,360
we'll increase the difficulty
of the contest.

649
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,197
All of you

650
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,597
can contribute one dish.

651
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,440
However, the dish you contribute

652
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,840
must be related

653
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,399
to the herbs you gathered.

654
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,799
That's simple.

655
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,640
You're cheating here.

656
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,357
Black sesame seeds.
Homology of food and medicine.

657
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,597
I'll surely be able
to have dinner tonight.

658
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,557
You're being crafty.

659
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,837
-We'll confiscate it.
-That's right.

660
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,000
Master, don't do that.

661
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,160
We'll confiscate it. This won't do.

662
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,440
I guess I'm cheating too.

663
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,000
I'm a cook.

664
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,077
I can just

665
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,917
harvest some wild vegetables here.

666
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,437
I can cook soup with them,
stir-fry them,

667
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,717
fry them with garlic, anything.

668
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,799
Stop right there.

669
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,357
I haven't finished

670
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,920
announcing your mission.

671
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,160
Not only must you guys
gather edible herbs,

672
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,400
but you guys must also

673
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,397
recite a line of poem

674
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,800
that's related to them.

675
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:25,999
What do you think?

676
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,520
Any questions?

677
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,560
You're asking me that?

678
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,899
Just tell me if you don't want me
to have dinner.

679
00:28:34,236 --> 00:28:35,476
A line of poem?

680
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,120
I guess you understood
what I was getting at.

681
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,559
Wealth enriches one materially,

682
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,999
but virtue is its own reward.

683
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,440
Only those who are cultured

684
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,160
can excel at TCM.

685
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,800
As a cultured person,

686
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,157
if you guys spend some effort
to study them,

687
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,400
you'll discover

688
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,640
that many ancient
Chinese poems and verses

689
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,520
contain

690
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,400
elements of Chinese medicine.

691
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,680
This is not too tough

692
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,080
for you guys, right?

693
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,476
Who said so?

694
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,160
-Is it tough?
-Yeah.

695
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,000
Just as my boat has left the dork,

696
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,040
suddenly I heard someone
singing on the shore.

697
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,400
Even if the Peach Blossom Pond
was a thousand feet deep,

698
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,560
it would not be as deep
as our friendship.

699
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,960
Peach blossom

700
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,360
is a type of Chinese medicine.

701
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,879
Consuming peach blossom

702
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,077
dissipates blood stasis.

703
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,317
Drawing a peach charm

704
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,440
wards off evil.

705
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,159
Amazing.

706
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,957
Mr Qiu.

707
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,037
Don't you think...

708
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,077
Don't you think

709
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,357
we're like old buddies

710
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,680
even though we only met
for the first time?

711
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,000
-Don't you think so?
-What do you mean?

712
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,479
I think
you should

713
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,639
follow me today.

714
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,557
We can stay as a duo.
After I gather the herbs,

715
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,037
you can tell me what poem I can recite
and what herbs they are.

716
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,317
It's cheating if you bring
Mr Qiu with you.

717
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,680
That's cheating. That won't do.

718
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,520
Guys, what about this?

719
00:29:44,604 --> 00:29:45,676
Mr Qiu.

720
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,519
Let's challenge ourselves for one.

721
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,400
We'll only allow the students
to complete the challenge themselves.

722
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,237
We can verify if you guys

723
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,400
can put what you learned into practice.

724
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,760
-Okay?
-What will you two do then?

725
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,400
We'll give out free diagnoses

726
00:29:59,847 --> 00:30:01,607
for the villagers there.

727
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,000
Guys, time to gather some herbs.

728
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,760
-You can do it.
-We can do it!

729
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,239
Let's go.

730
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,600
What did that poem mean?

731
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,717
It was To Wang Lun by Li Bai.

732
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,799
Who's Wang Lun?

733
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,519
He's a friend of Li Bai.

734
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,437
Were they close to each other?

735
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,519
They were buddies.

736
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,120
Zhao Li Quan! Is this a herb?

737
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,120
Is this a herb? What is this?

738
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,679
Give it to me.

739
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,440
What is that?

740
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,159
I'll take it.

741
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,759
Let go.

742
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,640
Give it to me!

743
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,837
Mind your feet.

744
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,040
You should gather them over there.

745
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,759
Take this.

746
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,240
These aren't herbs.

747
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,159
These are weeds.

748
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,039
Dormmate!

749
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,400
What are you digging for?

750
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,837
I've checked the area here.

751
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,919
There's nothing here.

752
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,920
I'll check that area out, okay?

753
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,799
Roubecca!

754
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,999
Are you okay?

755
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,039
What happened?

756
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,639
We're back.

757
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,240
We're back.

758
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,519
It was pouring out there.

759
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,400
-It's raining.
-What is this?

760
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,640
Where did you get this?

761
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,279
It's called a money box.

762
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,480
It's the predecessor

763
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,959
of piggy banks.

764
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,160
Your name is on it.

765
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,399
Yeah.

766
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,720
Ren Xin Zheng.

767
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,557
After giving out free diagnoses,

768
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,480
our friends in the village

769
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,480
made it for me especially.

770
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,200
There's an issue with this money box.

771
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,157
You can only put money in it.
You cannot take it out.

772
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,277
You can't spend your money like this.

773
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,477
This design...

774
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,560
It's pretty...

775
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,760
This is passed down to them
by their ancestors.

776
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,400
It's a token of appreciation.

777
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,519
By the way, Master,

778
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,000
Yang Xiao Hong slipped and fell
when she was gathering herbs.

779
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,877
We sent her to the hospital.

780
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,718
But it's not a huge issue.

781
00:33:42,801 --> 00:33:44,160
Don't worry. It's not a big deal.

782
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,199
She's been sent to the hospital?

783
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,159
Yes, Mr Ren.

784
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,200
Yang Xiao Hong didn't want anyone else
to carry her.

785
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,200
Tou Tou carried her
all the way to the base of the mountain.

786
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,719
You carried her?

787
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,880
Yeah.

788
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,560
I'm strong.

789
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,078
I made my dish

790
00:34:02,161 --> 00:34:03,680
with the tender stems and leaves
of dandelion.

791
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,157
With green silk and a yellow core,
love is found,

792
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:10,280
and the fluttering dandelions

793
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,120
-descend.
-Excellent.

794
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,319
Excellent.

795
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,479
That's pretty good.

796
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:15,920
Dandelion

797
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,719
serves to relieve heatiness
and neutralize toxicity.

798
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,917
It also alleviates swellness
and dispels nodes.

799
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,997
No matter how you

800
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,677
use it,

801
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,759
it's effective.

802
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,479
That's right.

803
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,799
My turn.

804
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,717
Under the begonia flowers
bloom Solanum septemlobum,

805
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,120
beside the Chinese Pink bushes
lies perilla.

806
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,280
Excellent!

807
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:37,637
Excellent!

808
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:38,637
-Not bad.
-Excellent.

809
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,719
You passed.

810
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,479
My turn.

811
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,720
The bitter cold in the North
has not passed.

812
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,400
The spinach under the snow
are tough as steel armour.

813
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,800
The rich variety of winter vegetables
can last.

814
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,560
As winter makes them tougher.

815
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,277
-Excellent!
-Excellent!

816
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,078
Look at him.

817
00:34:55,161 --> 00:34:57,637
He chose an unpopular poem.

818
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,920
It must've been difficult.

819
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,880
-Tou Tou.
-You passed.

820
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,639
It's your turn.

821
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,559
Be careful.

822
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:19,360
The lotus blooms
in outer lake tall and low.

823
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,120
After the rain over green hills
fly the gulls white.

824
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:26,557
The painted boats on
rippling water slowly go,

825
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,360
our shadows move on mirror bright.

826
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,560
-Excellent!
-Excellent!

827
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,637
She recited two lines,

828
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,960
yet there were three mistakes.

829
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,240
What mistakes?

830
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,117
What do you mean?

831
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,200
High and low.

832
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,440
Slowly flow.

833
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,279
You should've told me earlier.

834
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,940
Master,

835
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,317
you should be thankful

836
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,120
that I can read them out loud.

837
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,560
This isn't
my expertise.

838
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,637
What about this?

839
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,680
Tell me the function of lotus seeds.

840
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,399
To prevent starvation.

841
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,519
She's right.

842
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,560
Speaking of lotus seeds,

843
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,400
the entire lotus plant

844
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,559
is useful.

845
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,159
For example, lotus leaves

846
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,840
can relieve heatiness,

847
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,080
alleviate dampness,

848
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,239
and prevent miscarriage.

849
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,680
Lotus pods

850
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,000
can prevent miscarriage

851
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,480
and protect our liver.

852
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,680
Lotus cores

853
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,799
can relieve heatiness

854
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:30,959
and aid in sleeping.

855
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,397
Lotus flowers

856
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,800
are good for the skin
and can relieve depression.

857
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,440
The joints of lotus root

858
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,280
can stop bleeding

859
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,400
and dissipate blood stasis.

860
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,760
Lotus seeds

861
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,400
can invigorate the spleen
soothe the nerves,

862
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,800
and prevent starvation.

863
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,117
-Alright.
-You're right.

864
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,480
I'm sure you guys are starving.

865
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,797
-Yeah.
-All of you passed.

866
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,440
Let's dig in.

867
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,837
-Let's dig in.
-Let's dig in.

868
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,919
Let's dig in.

869
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,359
Master, here.

870
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,356
-Not bad.
-Pretty good.

871
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,439
Not bad.

872
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,600
This is delicious.

873
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,760
Meng Meng, don't be scared.

874
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,437
You prepared these presents
for them personally.

875
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,640
I'm sure they will like them.

876
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,280
I'll keep you company.

877
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,919
Let's go.

878
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,479
Mr Ren,

879
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,120
Happy Teacher's Day.

880
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,040
Thank you.

881
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,479
Mr Qiu,

882
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,160
Happy Teacher's Day.

883
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,480
Thank you.

884
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,480
Mr Qiu, Happy Teacher's Day.

885
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,639
Okay.

886
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,480
Happy Teacher's Day.

887
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:17,877
Tou Tou.

888
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:18,959
-Master.
-Is it nice?

889
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,399
-Yeah.
-Take a sniff.

890
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,119
It smells great.

891
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,640
Today's an important day.

892
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:26,960
Today's Teacher's Day.

893
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,880
I hope you can

894
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,280
wish me Happy Teacher's Day

895
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,360
to express your gratitude for me.

896
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,279
Master,

897
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,797
it's not like I'm only grateful to you

898
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,240
during Teacher's Day.

899
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,120
I'm grateful to you every day.

900
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,957
That's why I'm not expressing
my gratitude to you

901
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,197
by wishing you Happy Teacher's Day

902
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,320
during Teacher's Day.

903
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,397
Got it?

904
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,997
You should.

905
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,837
If you don't,

906
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,200
I won't know how grateful you are

907
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,640
no matter what you've done for me.

908
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:02,200
You see, such occasions

909
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,200
are actually opportunities for you.

910
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,637
They give you a chance to say something

911
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,837
you're too shy to say usually.

912
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,960
If so, have you expressed your gratitude
toward Madam?

913
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,560
I saw you two

914
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,560
arguing this morning.

915
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:18,760
Have you apologised to her?

916
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,597
Did I even argue with her?

917
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,679
You did.

918
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,223
Madam told you to put on
a scarf this morning.

919
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,440
It was for your sake.
You didn't want to.

920
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,877
You said there was no need to put it on
since it wasn't cold.

921
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,120
After that, you even glared at her.

922
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,707
Madam changed her expression

923
00:39:30,791 --> 00:39:32,076
immediately.

924
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,224
-These are two different things.
-They're the same.

925
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,956
You're not grateful for her at all.

926
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,051
You don't care
if she's angry or not.

927
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,759
Am I right?

928
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,760
I just said one thing.

929
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,880
What's with your heated response?

930
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,799
Who's the mentor here?

931
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,040
You said so yourself.

932
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,080
Principles, Methods, Formulas
and Medicinals, right?

933
00:39:53,164 --> 00:39:54,676
Principles, Methods, Formulas
and Medicinals.

934
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,757
Once you know the principles,

935
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,800
everything will fall into place.

936
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,597
But you don't practice what you preach.

937
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,357
And, when you can't defeat me
in an argument,

938
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,117
you'll pressure me with your title.

939
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,480
Just look at you.

940
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,146
You see,
I only take the matter

941
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,039
on its merits.

942
00:40:10,246 --> 00:40:11,439
That's all.

943
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,279
I don't care.

944
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,957
Wish me Happy Teacher's Day first.

945
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,039
I...

946
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:23,920
I don't care.

947
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,480
Don't try to negotiate with me.

948
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:26,677
There's no room for negotiation.

949
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,797
It's just like

950
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,360
how I cannot negotiate with you
when it comes to homework.

951
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:30,799
Having heard the Way in the morning,

952
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,120
one may not die content in the evening.

953
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,439
They die immediately.

954
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,200
Call her and apologise to her.

955
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:39,919
Goodness.

956
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,277
You're a grown-up, you know?

957
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,440
You're so insensible.

958
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,373
You still need me to teach you
what to do?

959
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,837
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

960
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,117
(are referenced from relevant
traditional Chinese medicine books)

961
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,800
