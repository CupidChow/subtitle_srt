(Episode 14)

00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,059
(Qibo Medical Centre)

4
00:01:47,178 --> 00:01:48,018
This is amazing.

5
00:01:49,138 --> 00:01:50,138
This is truly amazing.

6
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:52,819
Try and move around.

7
00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:54,458
See if it still hurts.

8
00:01:55,019 --> 00:01:56,099
Look, I'm fine.

9
00:01:56,659 --> 00:01:57,739
Ms Dong, thank you.

10
00:01:57,858 --> 00:01:59,259
-Thank you.
-Don't mention it.

11
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:01,499
Ms Dong, can you teach me
what you did just now?

12
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:02,618
Many of my colleagues

13
00:02:02,618 --> 00:02:03,979
have waist issues.

14
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:05,899
I can give them a massage
after you teach me that technique.

15
00:02:05,899 --> 00:02:08,258
-Yes.
-I'm afraid I cannot teach you yet.

16
00:02:08,938 --> 00:02:10,659
You quit the apprentice class.

17
00:02:10,898 --> 00:02:13,138
Besides, you're lagging in progress.

18
00:02:15,098 --> 00:02:17,179
Tou Tou, so, you were a student here?

19
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:17,975
Stop it.

20
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,960
If so, why did you become
a delivery rider?

21
00:02:22,898 --> 00:02:23,979
Ms Dong is amazing.

22
00:02:24,179 --> 00:02:25,659
You must learn from her

23
00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:26,738
and master her technique.

24
00:02:26,778 --> 00:02:27,898
That way, we can find you

25
00:02:27,938 --> 00:02:28,979
if we have waist issues in the future.

26
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:32,539
Do you wish to learn then?

27
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:34,393
I do.

28
00:02:35,898 --> 00:02:36,738
I do wish to learn.

29
00:02:38,539 --> 00:02:40,099
But I think Master

30
00:02:41,178 --> 00:02:42,699
won't accept me.

31
00:02:43,258 --> 00:02:44,258
Whether your master

32
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:45,818
wants to teach you or not

33
00:02:45,818 --> 00:02:46,779
depends on him.

34
00:02:47,019 --> 00:02:48,258
Whether you wish to learn or not

35
00:02:48,258 --> 00:02:50,218
-depends on you.
-That's right.

36
00:02:50,258 --> 00:02:52,818
Faith will move mountains.

37
00:02:53,538 --> 00:02:54,349
You should

38
00:02:54,538 --> 00:02:57,019
apologise to your master

39
00:02:57,139 --> 00:02:58,258
and beg for his forgiveness.

40
00:02:59,298 --> 00:03:00,739
Yes. Ms Dong is right.

41
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:01,898
You should

42
00:03:01,898 --> 00:03:03,059
apologise to your master.

43
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:06,498
Mister!

44
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:08,218
Mister, look!

45
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:09,818
My waist is fine now.

46
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:10,818
Mister,

47
00:03:10,818 --> 00:03:11,618
listen.

48
00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:12,599
Tou Tou

49
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:14,538
wishes to study TCM.

50
00:03:14,538 --> 00:03:15,858
And, she's very hard-working.

51
00:03:15,858 --> 00:03:17,659
She went to study straight away
and couldn't even be bothered with

52
00:03:17,818 --> 00:03:19,178
her greasy face

53
00:03:19,298 --> 00:03:20,659
after making deliveries.

54
00:03:21,019 --> 00:03:22,538
The dorm environment isn't the best too.

55
00:03:22,538 --> 00:03:24,459
Her co-workers play poker
and brag all day long.

56
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:25,858
Even so, she wasn't affected.

57
00:03:25,898 --> 00:03:27,178
She writes with a brush every day.

58
00:03:27,178 --> 00:03:28,099
She completes one essay per day.

59
00:03:28,258 --> 00:03:29,739
She never stops no matter

60
00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:30,659
how tired or busy she is.

61
00:03:31,258 --> 00:03:32,099
She's very hard-working.

62
00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:33,574
I'm serious.

63
00:03:36,178 --> 00:03:37,578
Go now.

64
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:38,674
Go now.

65
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:46,421
Apologise to him.

66
00:03:48,018 --> 00:03:49,258
-Hurry.
-Master.

67
00:03:51,258 --> 00:03:52,098
Thank you.

68
00:03:54,098 --> 00:03:55,098
Take care.

69
00:04:05,299 --> 00:04:06,538
Apologise to him.

70
00:04:06,738 --> 00:04:07,538
You don't understand.

71
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:08,898
Stop it.

72
00:04:08,898 --> 00:04:09,779
You...

73
00:04:10,178 --> 00:04:11,538
This lass is something else.

74
00:04:12,658 --> 00:04:13,658
Ms Dong,

75
00:04:13,658 --> 00:04:15,219
thank you for today.

76
00:04:16,098 --> 00:04:17,018
As for the fee,

77
00:04:17,018 --> 00:04:17,859
I've already told Master.

78
00:04:17,859 --> 00:04:19,618
I'll give it to him later.

79
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:20,658
If there's nothing else,

80
00:04:20,859 --> 00:04:21,939
we'll leave first.

81
00:04:22,859 --> 00:04:24,139
-Okay.
-Thank you, Ms Dong.

82
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:25,178
-Where's your jacket?
-Here.

83
00:04:25,178 --> 00:04:26,018
It's here.

84
00:04:26,579 --> 00:04:27,458
We'll make a move first.

85
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:28,315
Thank you.

86
00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:29,658
Thank you so much.

87
00:04:29,658 --> 00:04:30,538
Don't mention it.

88
00:04:30,538 --> 00:04:31,397
Thank you.

89
00:04:31,859 --> 00:04:32,668
Let's go.

90
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:33,717
Wait.

91
00:04:33,859 --> 00:04:34,979
Let me remind you again.

92
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:38,419
Although I've restored your spine
to its original position,

93
00:04:38,499 --> 00:04:40,818
you need some time
before the muscles can recover.

94
00:04:40,818 --> 00:04:41,618
If you have time,

95
00:04:41,618 --> 00:04:43,139
give him a gentle rub

96
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:44,898
along his spine

97
00:04:44,898 --> 00:04:46,219
every day.

98
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:48,299
If any of his muscles feel tense,

99
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:49,607
you can

100
00:04:49,859 --> 00:04:51,139
massage it gently

101
00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:52,979
and help them to release tension.

102
00:04:53,299 --> 00:04:55,139
-Okay.
-I have a bottle of ointment here.

103
00:04:55,579 --> 00:04:57,139
-Use it on him
-I'm fine now.

104
00:04:57,139 --> 00:04:58,219
tomorrow.

105
00:04:58,458 --> 00:04:59,538
It's fine. Just take it.

106
00:05:00,098 --> 00:05:00,979
Thank you, Ms Dong.

107
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:02,499
-Thank you, Ms Dong.
-You're welcome.

108
00:05:02,979 --> 00:05:04,499
-Don't mention it.
-We'll make a move now.

109
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:05,458
Okay.

110
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:06,419
Thank you, Ms Dong.

111
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:07,779
-Don't mention it.
-Goodbye.

112
00:05:07,818 --> 00:05:08,818
Goodbye.

113
00:05:09,178 --> 00:05:10,859
-Thank you, Ms Dong.
-Don't mention it.

114
00:05:21,818 --> 00:05:22,859
Mum, be careful.

115
00:05:31,579 --> 00:05:32,399
Mum,

116
00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:34,139
after this trip,

117
00:05:34,579 --> 00:05:35,859
I'll run out of rest days.

118
00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:38,579
Next time, you have to ask my brother
to bring you here.

119
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:42,299
We can talk about that after this trip.

120
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:43,979
I don't even know

121
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:46,059
if I can survive until the next trip.

122
00:05:46,699 --> 00:05:47,637
Mum,

123
00:05:48,018 --> 00:05:49,419
don't say such inauspicious words.

124
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:51,459
I'm forsaking my career
just to keep you company.

125
00:05:51,459 --> 00:05:53,139
You shouldn't let my effort
go down the drain.

126
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:55,818
I don't wish to be in debt too.

127
00:05:57,818 --> 00:05:58,859
I'll try to repay

128
00:06:00,019 --> 00:06:01,658
as much of my debt

129
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:05,299
as I can before I die.

130
00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:09,258
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

131
00:06:36,299 --> 00:06:37,658
-Flush.
-Next.

132
00:06:37,859 --> 00:06:38,818
-Do it.
-Ace!

133
00:06:38,818 --> 00:06:40,739
He's done for.

134
00:06:40,739 --> 00:06:41,579
Shuffle the cards.

135
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:42,459
Shuffle the cards.

136
00:06:44,378 --> 00:06:45,538
-Come and join us.
-Come on.

137
00:06:53,459 --> 00:06:55,139
Ms Dong did this, right?

138
00:06:55,579 --> 00:06:56,619
Not really.

139
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:00,299
Ms Dong is truly amazing.

140
00:07:00,299 --> 00:07:02,179
She cured me in seconds.

141
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:04,378
Where else can you
get a teacher like that?

142
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:07,579
I think Ms Dong wants
to take you as her student.

143
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:08,498
If you find her,

144
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:09,619
and if you do inherit

145
00:07:09,619 --> 00:07:10,579
her skills,

146
00:07:10,579 --> 00:07:12,218
you'll be able to help
many people in the future.

147
00:07:16,378 --> 00:07:17,579
I hurt Master's heart.

148
00:07:17,658 --> 00:07:18,859
Master won't take me back.

149
00:07:19,658 --> 00:07:21,658
And, Ms Dong is Master's good friend.

150
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:22,938
If Master doesn't take me back,

151
00:07:22,938 --> 00:07:24,139
Ms Dong won't take me
under her wing too.

152
00:07:24,459 --> 00:07:25,338
Silly girl,

153
00:07:25,338 --> 00:07:27,859
just find your master and tell him
to take you back.

154
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:35,299
It's been so many years.

155
00:07:35,899 --> 00:07:37,658
I've got into contact with many people
after making deliveries.

156
00:07:38,378 --> 00:07:39,538
I can tell who's good or bad

157
00:07:39,538 --> 00:07:40,739
in one go.

158
00:07:41,338 --> 00:07:42,538
Your master

159
00:07:43,378 --> 00:07:44,739
might look fierce,

160
00:07:44,859 --> 00:07:45,979
but he's kind.

161
00:07:46,739 --> 00:07:48,979
He told you to pay my fee for me.

162
00:07:49,258 --> 00:07:50,979
In the end, he forgot about it.

163
00:07:51,818 --> 00:07:53,579
I'll definitely pay him back.

164
00:07:53,579 --> 00:07:54,419
Don't worry.

165
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:55,579
Why are you trying to
return the money to him?

166
00:07:56,179 --> 00:07:57,739
If you study under him,

167
00:07:57,739 --> 00:07:58,979
you'll be doing him a favour.

168
00:08:06,979 --> 00:08:07,899
This is interesting.

169
00:08:09,459 --> 00:08:10,579
You didn't believe

170
00:08:10,579 --> 00:08:11,498
that I was a TCM student
when I told you.

171
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,427
(Qibo Medical Centre)

172
00:08:15,538 --> 00:08:16,979
I'll never be good at this.

173
00:08:17,299 --> 00:08:19,299
Calm down. You'll recover eventually.

174
00:08:19,579 --> 00:08:20,699
Xia is back.

175
00:08:21,739 --> 00:08:22,627
What do you think?

176
00:08:23,299 --> 00:08:24,699
Did you find the tile?

177
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:31,619
Did you find it or not?

178
00:08:32,699 --> 00:08:33,859
The first house

179
00:08:33,859 --> 00:08:35,498
isn't even 300 years old.

180
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:37,859
Regarding the second house...

181
00:08:38,658 --> 00:08:39,459
How is it?

182
00:08:39,778 --> 00:08:41,938
The house is 350 years old.

183
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,419
The house owner could confirm it.

184
00:08:44,538 --> 00:08:45,619
Isn't that good?

185
00:08:45,619 --> 00:08:46,525
What about the tile?

186
00:08:47,338 --> 00:08:48,258
But now,

187
00:08:48,419 --> 00:08:49,818
I've encountered some issues.

188
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:52,938
Although this house

189
00:08:53,179 --> 00:08:54,778
is over 300 years old,

190
00:08:54,979 --> 00:08:56,338
they renovate it

191
00:08:56,538 --> 00:08:57,658
once every decade.

192
00:08:58,098 --> 00:08:58,990
Tell me then.

193
00:08:59,299 --> 00:09:01,058
Do you think these tiles
are 300 years old then?

194
00:09:02,218 --> 00:09:03,090
This one?

195
00:09:04,098 --> 00:09:04,938
This looks like...

196
00:09:04,979 --> 00:09:06,579
Tian Zhen, come here.

197
00:09:06,619 --> 00:09:07,739
Help me analyse it.

198
00:09:08,859 --> 00:09:09,658
Look.

199
00:09:09,739 --> 00:09:10,778
This house

200
00:09:10,778 --> 00:09:12,218
is 300 years old.

201
00:09:12,538 --> 00:09:14,538
But they renovate it once every decade.

202
00:09:14,739 --> 00:09:16,218
So, do you think this tile

203
00:09:16,739 --> 00:09:18,058
is 300 years old?

204
00:09:23,538 --> 00:09:24,699
I know it's useless.

205
00:09:28,218 --> 00:09:29,139
This is nothing.

206
00:09:29,498 --> 00:09:30,538
If I can't find it this time,

207
00:09:30,538 --> 00:09:32,498
I'll find it next time, right?

208
00:09:32,579 --> 00:09:34,258
Our country is vast.

209
00:09:34,419 --> 00:09:37,098
I don't believe that I can't find
a 300-year-old tile.

210
00:09:37,179 --> 00:09:38,019
Precisely.

211
00:09:38,338 --> 00:09:39,459
I'll help you to inquire about it.

212
00:09:40,098 --> 00:09:41,859
In our hometown, which is a village,

213
00:09:42,058 --> 00:09:43,619
they have whitewashed

214
00:09:43,739 --> 00:09:45,058
houses and grey tiles.

215
00:09:45,058 --> 00:09:46,179
Houses that go on

216
00:09:46,179 --> 00:09:47,218
magazine covers.

217
00:09:47,218 --> 00:09:48,299
I'll also tell them

218
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:50,058
to ask if there are any
300-year-old houses around.

219
00:09:50,538 --> 00:09:51,979
If so, do they renovate it

220
00:09:52,098 --> 00:09:53,859
once every ten years too?

221
00:09:55,179 --> 00:09:56,179
All these years,

222
00:09:56,419 --> 00:09:57,459
the tourism industry

223
00:09:57,538 --> 00:09:58,778
is developing pretty rapidly.

224
00:09:58,979 --> 00:10:00,579
I think it might be
one of the reasons too.

225
00:10:01,538 --> 00:10:04,179
However, there are houses

226
00:10:04,179 --> 00:10:05,778
that are nicely preserved,

227
00:10:06,098 --> 00:10:08,299
which were bought by people.

228
00:10:08,299 --> 00:10:09,499
I'll ask them

229
00:10:09,499 --> 00:10:10,499
if they have any tiles like that.

230
00:10:11,098 --> 00:10:12,259
I'll thank you in advance then.

231
00:10:12,259 --> 00:10:13,299
-Thank you.
-It's what I should do.

232
00:10:13,299 --> 00:10:14,739
-Tian Zhen.
-What's the matter?

233
00:10:15,658 --> 00:10:16,538
Tou Tou is in trouble.

234
00:10:17,299 --> 00:10:18,179
What happened?

235
00:10:18,538 --> 00:10:19,496
Look.

236
00:10:30,778 --> 00:10:31,979
You shouldn't do this.

237
00:10:32,018 --> 00:10:33,098
Just return it to her.

238
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:35,098
-She's panicking!
-I didn't receive anything!

239
00:10:35,098 --> 00:10:36,218
I saw nothing!

240
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:37,979
She didn't

241
00:10:38,059 --> 00:10:39,658
deliver it to me personally!

242
00:10:40,218 --> 00:10:41,259
She said she delivered it

243
00:10:41,259 --> 00:10:42,218
to your doorstep.

244
00:10:42,218 --> 00:10:44,379
Maybe you took it inside by accident.

245
00:10:44,698 --> 00:10:46,338
No means no.

246
00:10:46,338 --> 00:10:47,259
How could that be?

247
00:10:47,259 --> 00:10:48,458
She's so annoying.

248
00:10:49,578 --> 00:10:50,698
Miss, I'm begging you here.

249
00:10:50,819 --> 00:10:52,059
I'm truly begging you here.

250
00:10:52,338 --> 00:10:54,179
Why don't you search your house again?

251
00:10:54,179 --> 00:10:55,018
It's a wedding ring.

252
00:10:55,018 --> 00:10:56,179
It's the wedding ring
of your neighbour upstairs.

253
00:10:56,179 --> 00:10:57,819
I can't afford to lose it.

254
00:10:57,819 --> 00:10:59,499
Why don't you search again?

255
00:10:59,698 --> 00:11:01,259
You're blaming me for it now?

256
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:03,018
You sent it to the wrong address.

257
00:11:03,018 --> 00:11:04,259
What has this got to do with me?

258
00:11:04,658 --> 00:11:06,379
You should compensate her for it!

259
00:11:06,578 --> 00:11:08,018
Do you think you can afford it?

260
00:11:08,778 --> 00:11:10,138
I didn't see it!

261
00:11:10,218 --> 00:11:11,819
I wasn't at home too!

262
00:11:20,259 --> 00:11:21,379
Dad, were you looking for me?

263
00:11:24,379 --> 00:11:25,379
Can you show me that video

264
00:11:25,379 --> 00:11:26,499
with your phone?

265
00:11:27,578 --> 00:11:28,489
Yeah.

266
00:11:30,698 --> 00:11:32,018
(You should return it to her.)

267
00:11:32,098 --> 00:11:32,979
(She's panicking.)

268
00:11:33,018 --> 00:11:34,819
(I didn't receive it! I saw nothing!)

269
00:11:35,138 --> 00:11:36,578
(She didn't deliver it)

270
00:11:36,578 --> 00:11:38,259
(to me personally.)

271
00:11:38,819 --> 00:11:40,698
(She said she delivered it
to your doorstep.)

272
00:11:40,819 --> 00:11:42,499
(Maybe you took it inside by accident.)

273
00:11:42,578 --> 00:11:43,898
Do you know how much it costs?

274
00:11:43,898 --> 00:11:44,859
Why is she kneeling?

275
00:11:44,859 --> 00:11:45,658
(I'm begging you!)

276
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:47,218
(I'm begging you here.)

277
00:11:47,379 --> 00:11:49,218
(Why don't you search your room again?)

278
00:11:49,218 --> 00:11:51,259
Doesn't she know that she shouldn't
kneel as my successor?

279
00:11:51,898 --> 00:11:53,379
She's not even a student now.

280
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,578
How could you call her your successor?

281
00:11:54,578 --> 00:11:56,098
She can choose not to be my student.

282
00:11:56,578 --> 00:11:58,458
However, she's the successor
of the Jiang family's acupuncture sect.

283
00:11:58,458 --> 00:11:59,859
You can't deny that, right?

284
00:12:00,778 --> 00:12:01,578
How much does it cost?

285
00:12:02,218 --> 00:12:03,819
It's not expensive. A diamond ring
costs over 30,000 yuan.

286
00:12:03,819 --> 00:12:05,819
Mainly, it's a wedding ring.
She couldn't get another one in time.

287
00:12:06,939 --> 00:12:07,739
(It's a wedding ring.)

288
00:12:07,819 --> 00:12:08,898
(It's the wedding ring
of your neighbour upstairs.)

289
00:12:08,898 --> 00:12:10,499
(I can't afford to lose it.)

290
00:12:11,098 --> 00:12:12,698
She's so short-tempered.

291
00:12:12,698 --> 00:12:14,419
She can't even deliver her goods
to the right person.

292
00:12:14,578 --> 00:12:16,179
It's not entirely her fault.

293
00:12:16,338 --> 00:12:17,338
The address was wrong.

294
00:12:17,578 --> 00:12:18,698
Initially, it was 3003.

295
00:12:18,698 --> 00:12:19,619
They wrote 303.

296
00:12:19,658 --> 00:12:21,578
She sent it to the third floor
since there was one zero less.

297
00:12:21,778 --> 00:12:23,739
Why isn't she admitting it then?

298
00:12:28,658 --> 00:12:29,819
Could it be

299
00:12:29,819 --> 00:12:30,658
that the garbage collector

300
00:12:31,098 --> 00:12:32,138
took it away?

301
00:12:32,819 --> 00:12:33,939
You guys should check out the junkyard.

302
00:12:34,098 --> 00:12:35,259
We've checked the surveillance camera

303
00:12:35,259 --> 00:12:36,338
for the entrance and exit.

304
00:12:36,619 --> 00:12:38,619
The garbage collector didn't come today.

305
00:12:38,939 --> 00:12:41,698
It's an express delivery.

306
00:12:41,898 --> 00:12:43,538
She has to ask for collection code.

307
00:12:43,578 --> 00:12:45,138
I don't have it!

308
00:12:45,819 --> 00:12:48,338
How could she leave it at the door?

309
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:49,619
It's my fault.

310
00:12:49,778 --> 00:12:50,633
I...

311
00:12:50,658 --> 00:12:51,939
I was on my way home.

312
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:53,698
I told her to leave it at the door.

313
00:12:53,698 --> 00:12:55,098
After that, I gave her the code.

314
00:12:55,259 --> 00:12:57,299
I didn't expect her to send it
to the wrong floor.

315
00:12:58,018 --> 00:12:59,778
If so, you should look for the sender.

316
00:12:59,898 --> 00:13:01,499
They wrote the wrong address.

317
00:13:02,259 --> 00:13:04,259
But I'm getting married tomorrow!

318
00:13:04,698 --> 00:13:05,619
What?

319
00:13:06,259 --> 00:13:07,338
If so, that means God

320
00:13:07,338 --> 00:13:08,538
doesn't want you to get married.

321
00:13:08,698 --> 00:13:09,739
Hey, mind your words.

322
00:13:09,739 --> 00:13:10,658
How could you say that?

323
00:13:10,898 --> 00:13:11,898
What's going on?

324
00:13:12,898 --> 00:13:14,819
Why are you guys here?

325
00:13:15,138 --> 00:13:16,578
And you! Why are you filming me?

326
00:13:16,578 --> 00:13:17,379
So what if I'm filming you?

327
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:18,259
Listen!

328
00:13:18,259 --> 00:13:19,458
Stop filming!

329
00:13:19,778 --> 00:13:20,619
Have you lost your mind?

330
00:13:20,619 --> 00:13:21,739
Stop filming me!

331
00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:27,458
There should be a surveillance camera

332
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,939
above the stairs.

333
00:13:31,338 --> 00:13:32,271
Yeah.

334
00:13:33,259 --> 00:13:35,059
Meng Meng told me that they installed
a camera in their peephole.

335
00:13:35,059 --> 00:13:36,259
I'll ask her neighbour if they have one.

336
00:13:48,138 --> 00:13:49,698
Over here.

337
00:13:54,018 --> 00:13:55,578
I didn't.

338
00:13:56,098 --> 00:13:57,138
I didn't see it.

339
00:13:57,138 --> 00:13:58,299
How can I return it to her?

340
00:13:58,338 --> 00:13:59,819
What are you guys doing?

341
00:13:59,819 --> 00:14:01,458
Why are you guys surrounding me?

342
00:14:01,578 --> 00:14:02,819
I told you already! I don't have it!

343
00:14:02,819 --> 00:14:03,819
Unit 302, is someone home?

344
00:14:04,698 --> 00:14:05,979
-Is someone there?
-Get up.

345
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:07,898
Did you install a camera
in the peephole?

346
00:14:08,698 --> 00:14:09,819
Why didn't I think of it?

347
00:14:10,098 --> 00:14:11,778
I'll contact the owner of
Unit 302 immediately.

348
00:14:11,778 --> 00:14:13,018
I'll tell him to come over immediately.

349
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,819
You guys should go back.

350
00:14:14,819 --> 00:14:16,338
Don't gather here.
Return to what you were doing.

351
00:14:17,138 --> 00:14:18,018
Go back.

352
00:14:18,018 --> 00:14:18,980
Please go back.

353
00:14:20,658 --> 00:14:22,419
Miss, you should go back too.

354
00:14:22,514 --> 00:14:23,377
You should get up first.

355
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:24,578
Here, get up.

356
00:14:25,259 --> 00:14:26,194
Thank you.

357
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,454
Be careful.

358
00:14:28,538 --> 00:14:30,259
What about this? You guys
can wait downstairs.

359
00:14:30,379 --> 00:14:31,311
We'll deal with this.

360
00:14:31,499 --> 00:14:32,338
Okay, thank you.

361
00:14:32,578 --> 00:14:33,551
Thank you for the trouble.

362
00:14:41,218 --> 00:14:42,898
Miss, I just checked

363
00:14:42,898 --> 00:14:44,259
the peephole from
the unit opposite yours.

364
00:14:44,499 --> 00:14:46,299
I'm not sure if they have
installed any surveillance camera.

365
00:14:46,658 --> 00:14:47,567
However, if they have,

366
00:14:47,778 --> 00:14:49,018
we'll know what happened

367
00:14:49,338 --> 00:14:50,259
when the unit owner

368
00:14:50,578 --> 00:14:51,898
retrieves his memory card for us

369
00:14:52,098 --> 00:14:53,018
after half an hour.

370
00:14:55,218 --> 00:14:56,578
You still have time

371
00:14:57,218 --> 00:14:58,138
to search the house again.

372
00:14:58,499 --> 00:14:59,658
See if you have taken the box inside

373
00:14:59,658 --> 00:15:00,898
by accident.

374
00:15:01,098 --> 00:15:02,018
If you take it out now,

375
00:15:02,658 --> 00:15:03,499
it'll be a misunderstanding.

376
00:15:04,338 --> 00:15:05,379
However, if there's evidence,

377
00:15:06,018 --> 00:15:07,739
you'll be convicted of larceny.

378
00:15:08,018 --> 00:15:08,938
You'll face legal punishment.

379
00:15:10,328 --> 00:15:11,202
By the way,

380
00:15:11,259 --> 00:15:13,819
how much did the lady say
her wedding ring cost again?

381
00:15:14,018 --> 00:15:14,939
38,000 yuan.

382
00:15:15,098 --> 00:15:15,937
Look.

383
00:15:16,098 --> 00:15:17,090
It's that expensive.

384
00:15:19,578 --> 00:15:20,898
Sir,

385
00:15:20,898 --> 00:15:21,898
please give me a second.

386
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:23,658
I'll search my house again.

387
00:15:30,218 --> 00:15:31,259
You see.

388
00:15:32,658 --> 00:15:35,098
I did take it by accident.

389
00:15:35,098 --> 00:15:35,998
This...

390
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:38,098
I'm truly sorry about this.

391
00:15:39,578 --> 00:15:40,432
Miss,

392
00:15:40,658 --> 00:15:41,778
the issue has been resolved.

393
00:15:41,898 --> 00:15:42,739
She maligned you.

394
00:15:43,578 --> 00:15:44,698
However, this does occur quite often.

395
00:15:45,138 --> 00:15:46,016
Everything's fine now.

396
00:15:50,898 --> 00:15:51,818
You guys should head back now.

397
00:15:52,338 --> 00:15:53,859
-Sorry for the trouble.
-Thank you.

398
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,138
Grandma, which one?

399
00:16:23,419 --> 00:16:24,271
Those two.

400
00:16:24,778 --> 00:16:25,979
-These?
-Yeah.

401
00:16:30,939 --> 00:16:31,787
Mum.

402
00:16:32,218 --> 00:16:33,105
Are you looking for books?

403
00:16:37,018 --> 00:16:38,619
I heard that you met Tou Tou today.

404
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:40,447
Yeah.

405
00:16:41,018 --> 00:16:41,898
How was she?

406
00:16:44,018 --> 00:16:44,898
She wasn't doing well.

407
00:16:45,098 --> 00:16:46,819
No one will be in a good mood
if they have to kneel like that.

408
00:16:51,379 --> 00:16:52,578
What about the mister
who came along with her?

409
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:53,578
How's his waist?

410
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,898
I don't know. I didn't care about him.

411
00:16:57,379 --> 00:16:58,331
Xin Zheng,

412
00:16:59,138 --> 00:17:00,338
about Tou Tou,

413
00:17:01,018 --> 00:17:02,859
I think it's unsafe

414
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:05,458
for a girl like her to live with

415
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:06,338
a bunch of guys.

416
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:07,771
Besides,

417
00:17:08,218 --> 00:17:09,619
punishing her for two days
should be enough.

418
00:17:10,898 --> 00:17:11,939
She's still young.

419
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:13,658
It's common for her to make mistakes.

420
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:15,739
If she stays outside for a long time,

421
00:17:16,379 --> 00:17:17,658
she'll revert to her wild nature.

422
00:17:17,698 --> 00:17:19,619
It wasn't easy to tame her, you know?

423
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:21,419
What do you say?

424
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:24,701
Tian Zhen,

425
00:17:25,138 --> 00:17:26,619
tell Tou Tou to come back

426
00:17:26,898 --> 00:17:27,815
and attend the apprentice class.

427
00:17:28,218 --> 00:17:29,138
Tell her

428
00:17:29,739 --> 00:17:31,499
to apologise to your father.

429
00:17:31,499 --> 00:17:32,416
Tell her

430
00:17:32,499 --> 00:17:33,859
not to repeat her mistake.

431
00:17:35,259 --> 00:17:36,158
You hear me?

432
00:17:39,379 --> 00:17:40,739
Your grandmother was talking to you.

433
00:17:40,739 --> 00:17:42,018
Why didn't you give her any responses?

434
00:17:42,578 --> 00:17:43,859
You're so rude.

435
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:03,939
I'm giving you a chance
to put what you learned to practice.

436
00:18:04,698 --> 00:18:06,059
I'm willing to let you massage my waist

437
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:07,698
even though you're terrible at it.

438
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:16,059
You must've suffered today.

439
00:18:16,819 --> 00:18:17,939
If it were me,

440
00:18:18,218 --> 00:18:19,098
I would've knelt too.

441
00:18:19,979 --> 00:18:21,819
It costs over 30,000 yuan.

442
00:18:21,819 --> 00:18:23,299
We won't be able to compensate them.

443
00:18:27,578 --> 00:18:28,819
I didn't kneel because of the money.

444
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:31,059
Why did you kneel then?

445
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:34,259
You're saying as if
you have 30,000 yuan.

446
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:37,299
You only make five yuan for
each delivery you make.

447
00:18:38,979 --> 00:18:41,058
I just didn't want
her happiness to be affected.

448
00:18:46,178 --> 00:18:48,218
You're willing to kneel for
other people's happiness.

449
00:18:49,098 --> 00:18:50,458
But you're not willing to kneel

450
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:51,539
for your own happiness.

451
00:18:52,578 --> 00:18:53,458
I think

452
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:54,859
you should behave
like what you did today.

453
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:56,739
You should kneel
in front of your master.

454
00:18:58,298 --> 00:18:59,418
You shouldn't get up before he agrees
to take you back as a student.

455
00:19:03,578 --> 00:19:04,458
Did you hear me?

456
00:19:08,058 --> 00:19:08,914
Give me a second.

457
00:19:14,859 --> 00:19:17,019
I don't have time to join you
for practice.

458
00:19:17,659 --> 00:19:18,536
Tou Tou,

459
00:19:18,938 --> 00:19:19,979
Grandma said she missed you.

460
00:19:20,698 --> 00:19:22,058
(She told you to apologise to Dad.)

461
00:19:22,659 --> 00:19:24,218
(You can come back and study medicine.)

462
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,298
Say something.

463
00:19:31,938 --> 00:19:33,578
Tell him that you'll apologise to him.

464
00:19:34,659 --> 00:19:36,298
Hurry, say something.

465
00:19:38,659 --> 00:19:39,542
Did you hear me?

466
00:19:41,739 --> 00:19:42,979
-Hurry.
-Apologise...

467
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:44,221
Wait.

468
00:19:45,938 --> 00:19:46,867
Got it.

469
00:19:48,218 --> 00:19:49,098
I miss them too.

470
00:19:51,739 --> 00:19:53,139
That's more like it.

471
00:20:08,899 --> 00:20:09,779
I used too much strength.

472
00:20:14,619 --> 00:20:15,500
I'll be using some strength.

473
00:20:17,619 --> 00:20:19,019
That's more like it.

474
00:20:23,218 --> 00:20:24,818
Hey, watch it. It's new.

475
00:20:24,859 --> 00:20:26,139
Don't break it.

476
00:20:26,145 --> 00:20:27,000
Be gentle.

477
00:20:27,019 --> 00:20:28,698
Uncle Tao, when did you
get yourself a new bike?

478
00:20:28,739 --> 00:20:30,139
You were not willing to spend money
to see doctors even when you were sick.

479
00:20:30,139 --> 00:20:31,098
Precisely.

480
00:20:31,739 --> 00:20:33,019
It's free.

481
00:20:33,019 --> 00:20:34,298
They held an event
for the new eco-vehicle.

482
00:20:34,298 --> 00:20:35,139
I went to help them out.

483
00:20:35,139 --> 00:20:36,139
I got it from a lucky draw.

484
00:20:36,139 --> 00:20:37,139
Get off the bike.

485
00:20:37,499 --> 00:20:38,619
I plan to give it

486
00:20:38,859 --> 00:20:39,739
to Tou Tou.

487
00:20:39,899 --> 00:20:41,098
Why aren't you giving it to us?

488
00:20:41,098 --> 00:20:41,982
Yeah.

489
00:20:42,259 --> 00:20:43,499
She's a girl.

490
00:20:43,499 --> 00:20:45,458
It's already tough enough for her
to work together with guys like her.

491
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:46,499
-Yeah.
-Besides,

492
00:20:47,139 --> 00:20:48,539
she can begin a new life

493
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:50,178
after getting this bike.

494
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,217
He's right.

495
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,114
Later,

496
00:20:52,139 --> 00:20:52,938
all of you should keep it a secret.

497
00:20:52,938 --> 00:20:54,499
Let's surprise Tou Tou
when she comes back.

498
00:20:54,499 --> 00:20:55,539
-Okay.
-Don't tell her.

499
00:20:55,859 --> 00:20:56,811
Okay.

500
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,342
(Qibo Medical Centre)

501
00:21:10,379 --> 00:21:11,779
I practised writing every day.

502
00:21:13,139 --> 00:21:14,338
I didn't even skip a single day.

503
00:21:33,979 --> 00:21:35,619
But you don't like TCM.

504
00:21:36,259 --> 00:21:37,779
What's the use of writing them down?

505
00:21:38,859 --> 00:21:40,739
I didn't want to study TCM before this.

506
00:21:42,098 --> 00:21:43,859
But now, I don't know
if I can be a TCM practitioner

507
00:21:43,859 --> 00:21:45,379
even if I wish to study TCM.

508
00:21:50,259 --> 00:21:52,139
Master, I know you're a good person.

509
00:21:52,619 --> 00:21:54,578
Although I don't really get what you say

510
00:21:54,578 --> 00:21:55,779
sometimes,

511
00:21:56,139 --> 00:21:57,098
I know

512
00:21:57,098 --> 00:21:58,499
that I won't be led astray

513
00:21:58,499 --> 00:21:59,418
if I follow your advice

514
00:21:59,619 --> 00:22:01,338
and study hard.

515
00:22:06,418 --> 00:22:09,379
I still wish to study under you.

516
00:22:26,338 --> 00:22:27,235
Go now.

517
00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:49,218
Don't tell me she's in trouble?

518
00:22:57,539 --> 00:22:58,899
She's not out yet.

519
00:23:01,298 --> 00:23:02,139
This is bad.

520
00:23:12,499 --> 00:23:13,443
How is it?

521
00:23:14,379 --> 00:23:16,218
Say something. Did he say yes or no?

522
00:23:18,499 --> 00:23:19,339
This is bad.

523
00:23:19,739 --> 00:23:20,859
Go and tell your father

524
00:23:21,098 --> 00:23:22,499
that it isn't Tou Tou's fault alone.

525
00:23:22,739 --> 00:23:23,938
The others are at fault too.

526
00:23:24,499 --> 00:23:26,139
He mustn't just punish her alone.

527
00:23:26,619 --> 00:23:27,529
Think of something.

528
00:23:28,779 --> 00:23:30,178
Yes, everyone is at fault.

529
00:23:30,259 --> 00:23:31,859
We can't just let you
face the music alone.

530
00:23:31,859 --> 00:23:32,859
I'll tell my father about this.

531
00:23:33,018 --> 00:23:33,916
I don't believe I can't resolve this.

532
00:23:35,338 --> 00:23:36,172
Meng Meng!

533
00:23:37,379 --> 00:23:38,899
Meng Meng! I'm sorry!

534
00:23:39,379 --> 00:23:40,458
I was joking with you.

535
00:23:40,458 --> 00:23:41,379
I'm not leaving.

536
00:23:42,499 --> 00:23:43,739
Master allowed me to stay.

537
00:23:46,779 --> 00:23:48,139
If so, why did you...

538
00:23:50,338 --> 00:23:52,458
I just shook my head.
I didn't say I was going to leave.

539
00:24:04,755 --> 00:24:05,600
Where are you going?

540
00:24:10,499 --> 00:24:11,938
Didn't you tell me to go?

541
00:24:13,499 --> 00:24:15,218
You should keep your stuff

542
00:24:15,218 --> 00:24:16,259
and get changed.

543
00:24:16,499 --> 00:24:17,619
We have a consultation to attend.

544
00:24:21,979 --> 00:24:23,539
You're lagging in
the hands-on technique class.

545
00:24:24,019 --> 00:24:25,779
Tell your classmates
to give you tuition when you're free.

546
00:24:29,619 --> 00:24:31,019
I can come back now?

547
00:24:33,259 --> 00:24:34,132
But I have conditions.

548
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,120
Sure.

549
00:24:35,458 --> 00:24:36,379
I'm fine with any conditions.

550
00:24:37,539 --> 00:24:39,218
Memorise one page of
the classics every day.

551
00:24:39,379 --> 00:24:40,208
Okay.

552
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,240
I'll test you.

553
00:24:41,259 --> 00:24:42,091
No problem.

554
00:24:42,178 --> 00:24:43,619
After the renovation is done,

555
00:24:43,859 --> 00:24:44,698
you have to clean up
the classroom in advance.

556
00:24:44,698 --> 00:24:45,979
Okay.

557
00:24:49,619 --> 00:24:50,465
And,

558
00:24:51,379 --> 00:24:52,259
no ripped pants or jeans.

559
00:24:55,499 --> 00:24:57,619
But why?

560
00:24:58,619 --> 00:24:59,619
No bare feet allowed.

561
00:25:00,139 --> 00:25:00,979
Wear your socks.

562
00:25:04,739 --> 00:25:05,689
Okay.

563
00:25:10,338 --> 00:25:11,186
Okay.

564
00:25:13,859 --> 00:25:14,713
Okay.

565
00:25:17,779 --> 00:25:18,670
Go now.

566
00:25:20,098 --> 00:25:21,019
Go where?

567
00:25:21,619 --> 00:25:22,570
Go and get changed.

568
00:25:35,979 --> 00:25:36,859
You're something else.

569
00:25:38,619 --> 00:25:39,578
Everything's fine now.

570
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,507
(As weather turns cold gradually,)

571
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,694
(Cold Dew arrives.)

572
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,395
(Fall brings gold with a hint of white,)

573
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,424
(describing the dew of Fall as white,
it is also known as White Dew.)

574
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,923
(White Dew)

575
00:26:18,338 --> 00:26:19,321
Meng Meng, look.

576
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:21,139
-The scenery is great, right?
-It's so beautiful.

577
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:23,418
Not bad at all.

578
00:26:24,979 --> 00:26:25,970
Slow down.

579
00:26:27,379 --> 00:26:28,619
Guys, gather around.

580
00:26:28,779 --> 00:26:29,673
Tou Tou,

581
00:26:29,698 --> 00:26:30,610
come here.

582
00:26:31,139 --> 00:26:32,072
Come here.

583
00:26:35,739 --> 00:26:36,899
Leave the pole over there for now.

584
00:26:39,739 --> 00:26:40,765
Guys,

585
00:26:41,019 --> 00:26:41,979
today,

586
00:26:41,979 --> 00:26:44,899
Mr Qiu will teach you guys
about Chinese pharmacology.

587
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,280
(Qiu Jian Xian)

588
00:26:47,379 --> 00:26:48,329
Wait.

589
00:26:48,539 --> 00:26:49,698
I thought we were on holiday?

590
00:26:49,698 --> 00:26:51,139
Why are we still holding lessons here?

591
00:26:51,979 --> 00:26:54,458
Mother Nature is a natural classroom.

592
00:26:58,259 --> 00:26:59,135
Guys,

593
00:26:59,338 --> 00:27:01,379
we shouldn't differentiate
between daily lives

594
00:27:01,659 --> 00:27:03,298
and treating patients. For example,

595
00:27:04,139 --> 00:27:05,259
there's a saying taught by

596
00:27:05,259 --> 00:27:06,139
the natives here.

597
00:27:06,306 --> 00:27:07,149
It's called

598
00:27:07,379 --> 00:27:08,338
"If you're bitten by a snake,"

599
00:27:08,539 --> 00:27:09,499
"the antidote can be found"

600
00:27:09,499 --> 00:27:10,418
"within 100 steps".

601
00:27:11,139 --> 00:27:13,458
It makes perfect sense.

602
00:27:13,499 --> 00:27:14,371
It's because

603
00:27:14,499 --> 00:27:16,379
Yin and Yang are not
two different sides.

604
00:27:16,979 --> 00:27:19,019
It's both sides of the same coin.

605
00:27:19,259 --> 00:27:20,219
For example,

606
00:27:20,458 --> 00:27:21,899
one side of Earth

607
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:23,218
is facing the sun.

608
00:27:23,779 --> 00:27:24,899
But on the other side,

609
00:27:25,218 --> 00:27:26,338
it must be facing the moon.

610
00:27:27,259 --> 00:27:28,818
One bite of lychee is equal
to three flaming torches.

611
00:27:29,139 --> 00:27:30,019
Lychee

612
00:27:30,019 --> 00:27:32,218
is considered a heaty fruit.

613
00:27:32,499 --> 00:27:34,098
There's a popular saying.

614
00:27:34,098 --> 00:27:35,619
To neutralize the heatiness of lychee,

615
00:27:35,859 --> 00:27:37,499
you need the membrane inside its shell.

616
00:27:38,139 --> 00:27:40,218
You need to peel the membrane
and cook it with water.

617
00:27:40,218 --> 00:27:42,338
This way, the heatiness
will be neutralized.

618
00:27:43,344 --> 00:27:44,362
Guys,

619
00:27:44,659 --> 00:27:45,859
when we learn Chinese pharmacology

620
00:27:45,859 --> 00:27:46,979
in the classroom,

621
00:27:47,379 --> 00:27:49,379
it's just like how doctors

622
00:27:49,379 --> 00:27:51,379
dissect bodies in the autopsy room

623
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:53,739
to understand the human body.

624
00:27:55,019 --> 00:27:58,098
Therefore, if we learn Chinese
pharmacology in a natural setting,

625
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,841
we'll be able to apply what we learn.

626
00:28:02,659 --> 00:28:04,379
If you're bitten by a snake,

627
00:28:04,619 --> 00:28:06,338
the antidote can be found
within 100 steps.

628
00:28:08,379 --> 00:28:09,279
I understand now.

629
00:28:09,499 --> 00:28:10,659
It's just like

630
00:28:11,458 --> 00:28:13,379
there's always a McDonald's

631
00:28:13,379 --> 00:28:14,539
beside a KFC.

632
00:28:14,899 --> 00:28:15,857
Am I right?

633
00:28:15,979 --> 00:28:17,019
It's just like the local specialities,

634
00:28:17,019 --> 00:28:19,098
they sell at tourist spots.

635
00:28:19,259 --> 00:28:21,218
-Am I right?
-What is that nonsense?

636
00:28:21,218 --> 00:28:22,499
Tou Tou's crude words

637
00:28:22,499 --> 00:28:24,619
carry fine ideas.

638
00:28:25,139 --> 00:28:26,019
You get me?

639
00:28:26,338 --> 00:28:27,227
Fall in.

640
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:28,657
Guys,

641
00:28:28,779 --> 00:28:30,818
we can hold a contest today.

642
00:28:31,259 --> 00:28:33,619
Back then, Li Shi Zhen travelled

643
00:28:33,619 --> 00:28:34,818
across mountains and hills
to gather herbs

644
00:28:34,859 --> 00:28:36,739
and compile

645
00:28:37,098 --> 00:28:38,098
the Compendium of Materia Medica.

646
00:28:38,259 --> 00:28:39,139
You guys know

647
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:41,698
that dew water can be used as medicine.

648
00:28:41,698 --> 00:28:43,458
So, today, you guys can

649
00:28:43,619 --> 00:28:46,338
travel across the hills

650
00:28:46,539 --> 00:28:47,499
to gather herbs

651
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:49,619
and train your legs.

652
00:28:49,859 --> 00:28:50,938
You guys can come back

653
00:28:50,938 --> 00:28:52,218
before dinner time.

654
00:28:52,499 --> 00:28:53,899
The person who gathered the most herbs

655
00:28:54,379 --> 00:28:57,619
can order the food they want.

656
00:28:57,619 --> 00:28:58,561
What do you think?

657
00:29:00,218 --> 00:29:01,259
TCM preaches

658
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:04,458
the homology of food and medicine.

659
00:29:04,458 --> 00:29:05,859
For dinner,

660
00:29:06,019 --> 00:29:07,458
we'll increase the difficulty
of the contest.

661
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,256
All of you

662
00:29:10,379 --> 00:29:11,779
can contribute one dish.

663
00:29:11,779 --> 00:29:13,539
However, the dish you contribute

664
00:29:13,739 --> 00:29:15,938
must be related

665
00:29:16,499 --> 00:29:17,298
to the herbs you gathered.

666
00:29:17,899 --> 00:29:18,837
That's simple.

667
00:29:22,619 --> 00:29:23,739
You're cheating here.

668
00:29:24,139 --> 00:29:26,539
Black sesame seeds.
Homology of food and medicine.

669
00:29:26,539 --> 00:29:28,779
I'll surely be able
to have dinner tonight.

670
00:29:28,779 --> 00:29:29,698
You're being crafty.

671
00:29:29,739 --> 00:29:31,019
-We'll confiscate it.
-That's right.

672
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:32,098
Master, don't do that.

673
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:34,259
We'll confiscate it. This won't do.

674
00:29:36,379 --> 00:29:38,539
I guess I'm cheating too.

675
00:29:38,739 --> 00:29:40,098
I'm a cook.

676
00:29:40,259 --> 00:29:41,259
I can just

677
00:29:41,259 --> 00:29:43,098
harvest some wild vegetables here.

678
00:29:43,098 --> 00:29:44,619
I can cook soup with them,
stir-fry them,

679
00:29:44,619 --> 00:29:45,899
fry them with garlic, anything.

680
00:29:45,899 --> 00:29:46,779
Stop right there.

681
00:29:47,259 --> 00:29:48,539
I haven't finished

682
00:29:48,539 --> 00:29:50,019
announcing your mission.

683
00:29:50,779 --> 00:29:53,259
Not only must you guys
gather edible herbs,

684
00:29:54,019 --> 00:29:55,499
but you guys must also

685
00:29:55,859 --> 00:29:57,578
recite a line of poem

686
00:29:57,578 --> 00:29:59,899
that's related to them.

687
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:01,049
What do you think?

688
00:30:02,619 --> 00:30:03,638
Any questions?

689
00:30:05,379 --> 00:30:06,659
You're asking me that?

690
00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:07,899
Just tell me if you don't want me

691
00:30:07,899 --> 00:30:08,859
to have dinner.

692
00:30:09,259 --> 00:30:10,499
A line of poem?

693
00:30:10,659 --> 00:30:12,218
I guess you understood
what I was getting at.

694
00:30:14,659 --> 00:30:15,524
Wealth enriches one materially,

695
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,062
but virtue is its own reward.

696
00:30:18,273 --> 00:30:19,554
Only those who are cultured

697
00:30:19,899 --> 00:30:21,259
can excel at TCM.

698
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:22,899
As a cultured person,

699
00:30:23,259 --> 00:30:24,338
if you guys spend some effort
to study them,

700
00:30:24,338 --> 00:30:25,499
you'll discover

701
00:30:25,659 --> 00:30:27,739
that many ancient
Chinese poems and verses

702
00:30:28,499 --> 00:30:29,619
contain

703
00:30:30,019 --> 00:30:31,499
elements of Chinese medicine.

704
00:30:31,739 --> 00:30:32,779
This is not too tough

705
00:30:33,379 --> 00:30:34,259
for you guys, right?

706
00:30:34,259 --> 00:30:35,499
Who said so?

707
00:30:35,659 --> 00:30:37,259
-Is it tough?
-Yeah.

708
00:30:39,019 --> 00:30:41,098
Just as my boat has left the dork,

709
00:30:41,338 --> 00:30:43,139
suddenly I heard someone
singing on the shore.

710
00:30:43,499 --> 00:30:45,499
Even if the Peach Blossom Pond
was a thousand feet deep,

711
00:30:45,859 --> 00:30:47,659
it would not be as deep
as our friendship.

712
00:30:47,859 --> 00:30:49,058
Peach blossom

713
00:30:49,338 --> 00:30:50,458
is a type of Chinese medicine.

714
00:30:50,979 --> 00:30:51,899
Consuming peach blossom

715
00:30:52,098 --> 00:30:53,259
dissipates blood stasis.

716
00:30:53,259 --> 00:30:54,499
Drawing a peach charm

717
00:30:54,499 --> 00:30:55,539
wards off evil.

718
00:30:57,259 --> 00:30:58,180
Amazing.

719
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,080
Mr Qiu.

720
00:31:01,139 --> 00:31:02,218
Don't you think...

721
00:31:02,218 --> 00:31:03,259
Don't you think

722
00:31:03,259 --> 00:31:04,539
we're like old buddies

723
00:31:04,539 --> 00:31:05,779
even though we only met
for the first time?

724
00:31:05,899 --> 00:31:07,098
-Don't you think so?
-What do you mean?

725
00:31:07,779 --> 00:31:08,578
I think

726
00:31:08,578 --> 00:31:09,458
you should

727
00:31:09,739 --> 00:31:10,619
follow me today.

728
00:31:10,859 --> 00:31:12,739
We can stay as a duo.
After I gather the herbs,

729
00:31:12,739 --> 00:31:14,218
you can tell me what poem I can recite
and what herbs they are.

730
00:31:14,218 --> 00:31:15,499
It's cheating if you bring
Mr Qiu with you.

731
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:16,779
That's cheating. That won't do.

732
00:31:18,499 --> 00:31:19,619
Guys, what about this?

733
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,720
Mr Qiu.

734
00:31:20,724 --> 00:31:23,484
Let's challenge ourselves for one.

735
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:26,490
We'll only allow the students
to complete the challenge themselves.

736
00:31:27,019 --> 00:31:28,418
We can verify if you guys

737
00:31:28,418 --> 00:31:30,499
can put what you learned into practice.

738
00:31:30,619 --> 00:31:31,859
-Okay?
-What will you two do then?

739
00:31:33,338 --> 00:31:34,499
We'll give out free diagnoses

740
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:36,619
for the villagers there.

741
00:31:38,019 --> 00:31:39,098
Guys, time to gather some herbs.

742
00:31:39,458 --> 00:31:40,859
-You can do it.
-We can do it!

743
00:31:42,338 --> 00:31:43,290
Let's go.

744
00:31:44,019 --> 00:31:45,698
What did that poem mean?

745
00:31:46,259 --> 00:31:47,899
It was To Wang Lun by Li Bai.

746
00:31:47,899 --> 00:31:48,859
Who's Wang Lun?

747
00:31:49,619 --> 00:31:50,499
He's a friend of Li Bai.

748
00:31:51,218 --> 00:31:52,619
Were they close to each other?

749
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:53,556
They were buddies.

750
00:32:17,372 --> 00:32:19,211
Zhao Li Quan! Is this a herb?

751
00:32:19,619 --> 00:32:21,218
Is this a herb? What is this?

752
00:32:21,779 --> 00:32:22,738
Give it to me.

753
00:32:39,095 --> 00:32:40,539
What is that?

754
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:42,098
I'll take it.

755
00:32:45,859 --> 00:32:46,787
Let go.

756
00:32:47,739 --> 00:32:48,741
Give it to me!

757
00:32:52,998 --> 00:32:53,993
Mind your feet.

758
00:32:54,019 --> 00:32:55,139
You should gather them over there.

759
00:33:26,859 --> 00:33:27,739
Take this.

760
00:33:31,139 --> 00:33:32,338
These aren't herbs.

761
00:33:36,259 --> 00:33:37,098
These are weeds.

762
00:33:51,139 --> 00:33:52,031
Dormmate!

763
00:33:53,458 --> 00:33:54,499
What are you digging for?

764
00:33:57,539 --> 00:33:58,979
I've checked the area here.

765
00:33:59,019 --> 00:33:59,929
There's nothing here.

766
00:34:00,379 --> 00:34:02,019
I'll check that area out, okay?

767
00:34:06,891 --> 00:34:07,816
Roubecca!

768
00:34:09,098 --> 00:34:10,025
Are you okay?

769
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:13,099
What happened?

770
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:26,646
We're back.

771
00:34:27,298 --> 00:34:28,338
We're back.

772
00:34:30,619 --> 00:34:31,437
It was pouring out there.

773
00:34:32,019 --> 00:34:33,499
-It's raining.
-What is this?

774
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:35,739
Where did you get this?

775
00:34:36,379 --> 00:34:37,338
It's called a money box.

776
00:34:38,298 --> 00:34:39,578
It's the predecessor

777
00:34:41,058 --> 00:34:41,899
of piggy banks.

778
00:34:44,218 --> 00:34:45,259
Your name is on it.

779
00:34:45,499 --> 00:34:46,421
Yeah.

780
00:34:46,779 --> 00:34:47,818
Ren Xin Zheng.

781
00:34:49,298 --> 00:34:50,739
After giving out free diagnoses,

782
00:34:50,739 --> 00:34:52,578
our friends in the village

783
00:34:52,818 --> 00:34:54,578
made it for me especially.

784
00:34:56,739 --> 00:34:58,298
There's an issue with this money box.

785
00:34:58,539 --> 00:35:00,338
You can only put money in it.
You cannot take it out.

786
00:35:00,338 --> 00:35:01,418
You can't spend your money like this.

787
00:35:01,458 --> 00:35:02,659
This design...

788
00:35:02,659 --> 00:35:03,659
It's pretty...

789
00:35:04,139 --> 00:35:05,859
This is passed down to them
by their ancestors.

790
00:35:06,058 --> 00:35:07,499
It's a token of appreciation.

791
00:35:11,619 --> 00:35:12,568
By the way, Master,

792
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:15,098
Yang Xiao Hong slipped and fell
when she was gathering herbs.

793
00:35:15,578 --> 00:35:17,058
We sent her to the hospital.

794
00:35:17,058 --> 00:35:17,899
But it's not a huge issue.

795
00:35:17,899 --> 00:35:19,259
Don't worry. It's not a big deal.

796
00:35:20,298 --> 00:35:21,098
She's been sent to the hospital?

797
00:35:22,259 --> 00:35:23,159
Yes, Mr Ren.

798
00:35:23,859 --> 00:35:25,298
Yang Xiao Hong didn't want anyone else
to carry her.

799
00:35:25,578 --> 00:35:27,298
Tou Tou carried her
all the way to the base of the mountain.

800
00:35:27,818 --> 00:35:28,720
You carried her?

801
00:35:29,698 --> 00:35:30,979
Yeah.

802
00:35:31,259 --> 00:35:32,659
I'm strong.

803
00:35:36,379 --> 00:35:37,259
I made my dish

804
00:35:37,259 --> 00:35:38,779
with the tender stems and leaves
of dandelion.

805
00:35:39,779 --> 00:35:42,338
With green silk and a yellow core,
love is found,

806
00:35:42,338 --> 00:35:45,378
and the fluttering dandelions

807
00:35:46,099 --> 00:35:47,218
-descend.
-Excellent.

808
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,364
Excellent.

809
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:49,440
That's pretty good.

810
00:35:49,979 --> 00:35:51,019
Dandelion

811
00:35:51,819 --> 00:35:52,698
serves to relieve heatiness
and neutralize toxicity.

812
00:35:53,299 --> 00:35:55,099
It also alleviates swellness
and dispels nodes.

813
00:35:55,099 --> 00:35:57,178
No matter how you

814
00:35:57,178 --> 00:35:58,858
use it,

815
00:35:58,858 --> 00:35:59,779
it's effective.

816
00:36:00,579 --> 00:36:01,493
That's right.

817
00:36:01,898 --> 00:36:02,821
My turn.

818
00:36:04,658 --> 00:36:06,898
Under the begonia flowers
bloom Solanum septemlobum,

819
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:09,218
beside the Chinese Pink bushes
lies perilla.

820
00:36:09,339 --> 00:36:10,360
Excellent!

821
00:36:11,739 --> 00:36:12,609
Excellent!

822
00:36:12,819 --> 00:36:13,672
-Not bad.
-Excellent.

823
00:36:13,819 --> 00:36:14,672
You passed.

824
00:36:15,579 --> 00:36:16,434
My turn.

825
00:36:17,979 --> 00:36:19,819
The bitter cold in the North
has not passed.

826
00:36:20,339 --> 00:36:22,499
The spinach under the snow
are tough as steel armour.

827
00:36:22,819 --> 00:36:24,898
The rich variety of winter vegetables
can last.

828
00:36:25,059 --> 00:36:27,658
As winter makes them tougher.

829
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,428
-Excellent!
-Excellent!

830
00:36:29,453 --> 00:36:30,259
Look at him.

831
00:36:30,259 --> 00:36:32,819
He chose an unpopular poem.

832
00:36:32,819 --> 00:36:34,019
It must've been difficult.

833
00:36:36,579 --> 00:36:37,979
-Tou Tou.
-You passed.

834
00:36:38,739 --> 00:36:39,613
It's your turn.

835
00:36:43,658 --> 00:36:44,579
Be careful.

836
00:36:48,299 --> 00:36:54,458
The lotus blooms
in outer lake tall and low.

837
00:36:55,019 --> 00:36:58,218
After the rain over green hills
fly the gulls white.

838
00:36:58,339 --> 00:37:01,739
The painted boats on
rippling water slowly go,

839
00:37:01,739 --> 00:37:04,458
our shadows move on mirror bright.

840
00:37:05,579 --> 00:37:06,658
-Excellent!
-Excellent!

841
00:37:07,819 --> 00:37:08,819
She recited two lines,

842
00:37:08,819 --> 00:37:10,059
yet there were three mistakes.

843
00:37:11,059 --> 00:37:12,339
What mistakes?

844
00:37:13,059 --> 00:37:14,299
What do you mean?

845
00:37:14,299 --> 00:37:15,299
High and low.

846
00:37:15,539 --> 00:37:16,539
Slowly flow.

847
00:37:23,378 --> 00:37:24,299
You should've told me earlier.

848
00:37:27,779 --> 00:37:28,658
Master,

849
00:37:29,138 --> 00:37:30,499
you should be thankful

850
00:37:30,499 --> 00:37:32,218
that I can read them out loud.

851
00:37:33,099 --> 00:37:34,259
This isn't

852
00:37:34,259 --> 00:37:35,539
my expertise.

853
00:37:36,858 --> 00:37:37,778
What about this?

854
00:37:37,819 --> 00:37:39,779
Tell me the function of lotus seeds.

855
00:37:42,499 --> 00:37:43,435
To prevent starvation.

856
00:37:45,618 --> 00:37:46,508
She's right.

857
00:37:47,339 --> 00:37:48,658
Speaking of lotus seeds,

858
00:37:49,299 --> 00:37:50,499
the entire lotus plant

859
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,538
is useful.

860
00:37:52,259 --> 00:37:53,218
For example, lotus leaves

861
00:37:53,898 --> 00:37:54,938
can relieve heatiness,

862
00:37:55,099 --> 00:37:56,178
alleviate dampness,

863
00:37:56,339 --> 00:37:57,299
and prevent miscarriage.

864
00:37:57,779 --> 00:37:58,779
Lotus pods

865
00:37:58,979 --> 00:38:00,099
can prevent miscarriage

866
00:38:00,579 --> 00:38:01,579
and protect our liver.

867
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:03,779
Lotus cores

868
00:38:03,898 --> 00:38:04,779
can relieve heatiness

869
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,003
and aid in sleeping.

870
00:38:06,579 --> 00:38:07,499
Lotus flowers

871
00:38:07,579 --> 00:38:09,898
are good for the skin
and can relieve depression.

872
00:38:10,499 --> 00:38:11,539
The joints of lotus root

873
00:38:11,779 --> 00:38:13,378
can stop bleeding

874
00:38:13,489 --> 00:38:14,489
and dissipate blood stasis.

875
00:38:14,858 --> 00:38:15,858
Lotus seeds

876
00:38:16,299 --> 00:38:18,499
can invigorate the spleen
soothe the nerves,

877
00:38:18,819 --> 00:38:20,898
and prevent starvation.

878
00:38:22,138 --> 00:38:23,259
-Alright.
-You're right.

879
00:38:23,299 --> 00:38:24,579
I'm sure you guys are starving.

880
00:38:24,779 --> 00:38:25,979
-Yeah.
-All of you passed.

881
00:38:25,979 --> 00:38:27,539
Let's dig in.

882
00:38:27,658 --> 00:38:28,938
-Let's dig in.
-Let's dig in.

883
00:38:29,019 --> 00:38:29,858
Let's dig in.

884
00:38:30,458 --> 00:38:31,259
Master, here.

885
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,269
-Not bad.
-Pretty good.

886
00:38:37,339 --> 00:38:38,271
Not bad.

887
00:38:39,618 --> 00:38:40,698
This is delicious.

888
00:38:53,819 --> 00:38:54,858
Meng Meng, don't be scared.

889
00:38:55,059 --> 00:38:56,539
You prepared these presents
for them personally.

890
00:38:56,618 --> 00:38:57,739
I'm sure they will like them.

891
00:38:58,378 --> 00:38:59,378
I'll keep you company.

892
00:39:01,012 --> 00:39:01,897
Let's go.

893
00:39:06,579 --> 00:39:07,453
Mr Ren,

894
00:39:08,218 --> 00:39:09,218
Happy Teacher's Day.

895
00:39:13,122 --> 00:39:14,132
Thank you.

896
00:39:17,579 --> 00:39:18,559
Mr Qiu,

897
00:39:19,099 --> 00:39:20,259
Happy Teacher's Day.

898
00:39:21,579 --> 00:39:22,578
Thank you.

899
00:39:26,218 --> 00:39:27,579
Mr Qiu, Happy Teacher's Day.

900
00:39:27,739 --> 00:39:28,625
Okay.

901
00:39:28,898 --> 00:39:30,579
Happy Teacher's Day.

902
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:52,857
Tou Tou.

903
00:39:53,059 --> 00:39:54,019
-Master.
-Is it nice?

904
00:39:54,499 --> 00:39:55,378
-Yeah.
-Take a sniff.

905
00:39:56,218 --> 00:39:57,107
It smells great.

906
00:39:58,779 --> 00:40:00,739
Today's an important day.

907
00:40:00,979 --> 00:40:02,059
Today's Teacher's Day.

908
00:40:02,739 --> 00:40:03,979
I hope you can

909
00:40:04,499 --> 00:40:06,378
wish me Happy Teacher's Day

910
00:40:06,618 --> 00:40:08,458
to express your gratitude for me.

911
00:40:12,378 --> 00:40:13,347
Master,

912
00:40:13,979 --> 00:40:15,979
it's not like I'm only grateful to you

913
00:40:15,979 --> 00:40:17,339
during Teacher's Day.

914
00:40:17,658 --> 00:40:19,218
I'm grateful to you every day.

915
00:40:19,579 --> 00:40:21,138
That's why I'm not expressing
my gratitude to you

916
00:40:21,138 --> 00:40:22,378
by wishing you Happy Teacher's Day

917
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:23,418
during Teacher's Day.

918
00:40:23,539 --> 00:40:24,382
Got it?

919
00:40:24,579 --> 00:40:27,178
You should.

920
00:40:27,178 --> 00:40:29,019
If you don't,

921
00:40:29,019 --> 00:40:31,299
I won't know how grateful you are

922
00:40:31,779 --> 00:40:33,739
no matter what you've done for me.

923
00:40:35,458 --> 00:40:37,299
You see, such occasions

924
00:40:37,579 --> 00:40:39,299
are actually opportunities for you.

925
00:40:40,299 --> 00:40:41,819
They give you a chance to say something

926
00:40:41,819 --> 00:40:44,019
you're too shy to say usually.

927
00:40:44,019 --> 00:40:46,059
If so, have you expressed your gratitude
toward Madam?

928
00:40:49,458 --> 00:40:50,658
I saw you two

929
00:40:51,138 --> 00:40:52,658
arguing this morning.

930
00:40:52,819 --> 00:40:53,858
Have you apologised to her?

931
00:40:54,539 --> 00:40:55,779
Did I even argue with her?

932
00:40:55,779 --> 00:40:56,695
You did.

933
00:40:57,739 --> 00:40:59,458
Madam told you to put on
a scarf this morning.

934
00:40:59,458 --> 00:41:00,618
It was for your sake.
You didn't want to.

935
00:41:00,618 --> 00:41:01,739
You said there was no need to put it on

936
00:41:01,739 --> 00:41:03,059
since it wasn't cold.

937
00:41:03,059 --> 00:41:04,218
After that, you even glared at her.

938
00:41:04,579 --> 00:41:05,579
Madam changed her expression

939
00:41:06,019 --> 00:41:07,259
immediately.

940
00:41:07,259 --> 00:41:09,178
-These are two different things.
-They're the same.

941
00:41:09,819 --> 00:41:10,938
You're not grateful for her at all.

942
00:41:10,938 --> 00:41:12,099
You don't care

943
00:41:12,099 --> 00:41:13,138
if she's angry or not.

944
00:41:13,858 --> 00:41:14,769
Am I right?

945
00:41:16,539 --> 00:41:17,858
I just said one thing.

946
00:41:20,259 --> 00:41:21,979
What's with your heated response?

947
00:41:22,898 --> 00:41:23,866
Who's the mentor here?

948
00:41:24,858 --> 00:41:26,138
You said so yourself.

949
00:41:26,339 --> 00:41:28,178
Principles, Methods, Formulas
and Medicinals, right?

950
00:41:28,378 --> 00:41:29,458
Principles, Methods, Formulas
and Medicinals.

951
00:41:29,858 --> 00:41:30,938
Once you know the principles,

952
00:41:30,938 --> 00:41:32,898
everything will fall into place.

953
00:41:34,059 --> 00:41:35,779
But you don't practice what you preach.

954
00:41:35,779 --> 00:41:37,539
And, when you can't defeat me
in an argument,

955
00:41:37,539 --> 00:41:39,299
you'll pressure me with your title.

956
00:41:39,299 --> 00:41:40,579
Just look at you.

957
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:42,178
You see,

958
00:41:42,339 --> 00:41:43,259
I only take the matter

959
00:41:44,138 --> 00:41:45,064
on its merits.

960
00:41:45,499 --> 00:41:46,539
That's all.

961
00:41:50,378 --> 00:41:51,211
I don't care.

962
00:41:52,299 --> 00:41:54,138
Wish me Happy Teacher's Day first.

963
00:41:54,138 --> 00:41:55,033
I...

964
00:41:57,979 --> 00:41:59,019
I don't care.

965
00:41:59,299 --> 00:42:00,579
Don't try to negotiate with me.

966
00:42:00,819 --> 00:42:01,858
There's no room for negotiation.

967
00:42:01,858 --> 00:42:02,938
It's just like

968
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:04,458
how I cannot negotiate with you
when it comes to homework.

969
00:42:04,898 --> 00:42:05,799
Having heard the Way in the morning,

970
00:42:06,138 --> 00:42:07,218
one may not die content in the evening.

971
00:42:07,539 --> 00:42:08,378
They die immediately.

972
00:42:12,059 --> 00:42:13,299
Call her and apologise to her.

973
00:42:14,019 --> 00:42:14,959
Goodness.

974
00:42:15,299 --> 00:42:16,458
You're a grown-up, you know?

975
00:42:16,458 --> 00:42:17,539
You're so insensible.

976
00:42:18,819 --> 00:42:20,259
You still need me to teach you
what to do?

977
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:32,969
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

978
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,215
(are referenced from relevant
traditional Chinese medicine books)

979
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,913
