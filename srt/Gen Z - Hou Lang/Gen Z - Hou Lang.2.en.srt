1
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,920
(Gen Z)

2
00:01:35,734 --> 00:01:37,734
(Episode 2)

3
00:01:43,777 --> 00:01:45,503
What were you thinking
by doing that today?

4
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,577
Nothing.

5
00:01:47,737 --> 00:01:50,175
I didn't want to pay respect to
a delivery girl who came out of nowhere.

6
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,800
What's wrong with
being a delivery girl?

7
00:01:51,897 --> 00:01:53,456
Does that make her inferior?

8
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,481
Since when have you developed
such a condescending attitude?

9
00:01:58,856 --> 00:02:00,616
I respect every working people,

10
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,396
...but it was one thing that
she delivered the food late,

11
00:02:03,477 --> 00:02:05,516
she was even full of lies.

12
00:02:06,177 --> 00:02:07,833
When I told her I cancelled the order,

13
00:02:08,016 --> 00:02:09,777
she threw the food on me.

14
00:02:10,336 --> 00:02:11,609
That's why I dressed

15
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,919
so informally that day.

16
00:02:14,577 --> 00:02:16,216
She can't even do her job well.

17
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,641
Now you want her to treat patients.

18
00:02:18,937 --> 00:02:21,057
Aren't you taking this too lightly?

19
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,720
Putting aside the fact that
you lifted her to that position,

20
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,962
even if she really becomes
a successor one day,

21
00:02:26,856 --> 00:02:28,577
I still won't bow to her.

22
00:02:28,856 --> 00:02:30,336
I wasn't asking you
to pay respect to her,

23
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:32,617
but rather her ancestors,
the Jiang family.

24
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,800
What are you doing here?

25
00:02:41,777 --> 00:02:42,763
Do you know each other?

26
00:02:43,057 --> 00:02:43,857
Yes.

27
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:45,297
Who is he?

28
00:02:45,857 --> 00:02:46,696
He's my son.

29
00:02:51,576 --> 00:02:52,936
If you don't bow to her,

30
00:02:53,137 --> 00:02:54,376
if you don't want to be
in this industry anymore,

31
00:02:54,457 --> 00:02:55,417
you can leave now.

32
00:02:56,057 --> 00:02:57,970
No need to compromise yourself
in this family.

33
00:02:59,623 --> 00:03:01,097
When I was a kid, I told you

34
00:03:01,137 --> 00:03:02,857
that I didn't want to study TCM.

35
00:03:03,217 --> 00:03:04,777
But you coerced me.

36
00:03:05,217 --> 00:03:07,016
You all did.

37
00:03:07,417 --> 00:03:08,857
I didn't even have a choice.

38
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,520
What did I sleep on
when I was a baby?

39
00:03:11,576 --> 00:03:12,576
Pulse pillow.

40
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,200
My teething tool was a scraping board.

41
00:03:14,296 --> 00:03:15,217
My toys were

42
00:03:15,217 --> 00:03:16,857
medicine cabinet,
brush and stone mortar.

43
00:03:18,296 --> 00:03:19,495
Now I'm almost done
with my Masters,

44
00:03:19,576 --> 00:03:20,777
and I'm about to do my PhD.

45
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,880
And you're telling me I can quit
if I want to?

46
00:03:24,057 --> 00:03:25,696
Why didn't you say this 20 years ago?

47
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,603
What do you want me to do now?

48
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:29,529
You can do whatever you want!

49
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,039
You have a bad back, right?

50
00:03:33,103 --> 00:03:34,956
Find a job where you
don't have to bow down!

51
00:03:39,057 --> 00:03:40,336
Tian Zhen, bow to her.

52
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:43,577
My back is injured.

53
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,720
I can't bow.

54
00:03:50,937 --> 00:03:52,017
Xin Zheng,

55
00:03:52,937 --> 00:03:53,990
don't take it out on him.

56
00:03:54,217 --> 00:03:55,017
Yes.

57
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:57,456
TCM practice emphasizes
a sense of propriety.

58
00:03:57,722 --> 00:03:59,703
It shouldn't be used
as an outlet for rage

59
00:04:00,017 --> 00:04:02,696
or to settle petty arguments.

60
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,126
I will keep it in mind, Master.

61
00:04:05,243 --> 00:04:06,043
Tian Zhen.

62
00:04:07,857 --> 00:04:08,657
Tian Zhen.

63
00:04:13,777 --> 00:04:14,577
Etiquette

64
00:04:15,577 --> 00:04:16,630
is like walking with shoes.

65
00:04:16,736 --> 00:04:17,536
Etiquette

66
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,319
is like wearing comfortable shoes.

67
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,615
Whether they are too big or too small,

68
00:04:23,696 --> 00:04:24,937
comfortable or not,

69
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:26,210
only you yourself know it.

70
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:30,176
It's okay.

71
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:31,736
You still have

72
00:04:32,017 --> 00:04:33,896
decades to cultivate yourself.

73
00:04:35,017 --> 00:04:37,857
You will be able to find suitable shoes

74
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:41,575
for any environment one day.

75
00:04:42,857 --> 00:04:43,657
Go on.

76
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,280
Give us the room.

77
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:57,175
Look at your son.

78
00:04:57,942 --> 00:04:58,823
You spoiled him.

79
00:04:59,696 --> 00:05:01,022
He didn't pick up our abilities.

80
00:05:01,456 --> 00:05:02,256
All he picked up

81
00:05:02,456 --> 00:05:03,336
was your bad temper.

82
00:05:05,475 --> 00:05:06,396
My son?

83
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:08,256
Are you not part of this?

84
00:05:08,696 --> 00:05:11,097
Who does he take after with that
foul and obstinate attitude?

85
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:12,857
Not me, anyway.

86
00:05:12,976 --> 00:05:13,816
Look at me,

87
00:05:14,176 --> 00:05:15,736
I do whatever you ask me to do,

88
00:05:15,937 --> 00:05:16,737
don't I?

89
00:05:18,616 --> 00:05:20,777
But you can't expect our son
to do the same.

90
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,040
Besides,

91
00:05:22,297 --> 00:05:23,176
based on the way

92
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,641
(that young girl behaved today,)

93
00:05:24,937 --> 00:05:26,696
(is she fit to be the successor?)

94
00:05:26,857 --> 00:05:28,896
(And you made her sit
on the head chair,)

95
00:05:29,137 --> 00:05:31,336
(and made us all bow to her.)

96
00:05:31,417 --> 00:05:32,977
If I didn't obey you

97
00:05:33,456 --> 00:05:34,623
and gave you face,

98
00:05:34,704 --> 00:05:36,223
would any of those students

99
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:37,777
have respected her?

100
00:05:40,497 --> 00:05:41,336
I have dedicated

101
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,336
my whole life

102
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:44,176
to TCM and you.

103
00:05:44,523 --> 00:05:46,857
But you can't ask your son
to do the same.

104
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,777
Don't you always say

105
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,616
we should follow the call of our heart?

106
00:05:51,902 --> 00:05:53,097
Your son doesn't accept her.

107
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,720
You can't force him.

108
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,521
If you coerce him,

109
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,280
his back will never heal.

110
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,720
Even surgery can't help him.

111
00:06:01,057 --> 00:06:01,857
Besides,

112
00:06:02,176 --> 00:06:03,456
our son wasn't wrong.

113
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,881
If someone like Sun Tou Tou
can become a doctor,

114
00:06:07,136 --> 00:06:10,016
TCM will really become a joke.

115
00:06:12,016 --> 00:06:14,537
Despite what I just said,

116
00:06:14,777 --> 00:06:16,336
I do have doubts

117
00:06:17,136 --> 00:06:19,296
about the girl.

118
00:06:20,802 --> 00:06:22,043
Her family background does

119
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,920
give her the right to be the successor,

120
00:06:25,576 --> 00:06:27,616
but whether she can hold firm

121
00:06:28,149 --> 00:06:28,977
in this position

122
00:06:29,058 --> 00:06:30,937
depends on her performance.

123
00:06:31,576 --> 00:06:33,896
If she were a normal

124
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,401
and well-behaved child,

125
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:38,609
there wouldn't be any issues.

126
00:06:38,896 --> 00:06:41,217
But with her current behaviour,

127
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:43,416
if you could mentor her well,

128
00:06:43,856 --> 00:06:44,736
she might actually be

129
00:06:45,269 --> 00:06:47,389
the hope of TCM.

130
00:06:48,336 --> 00:06:49,136
Therefore,

131
00:06:49,456 --> 00:06:50,736
whether she can

132
00:06:51,176 --> 00:06:54,075
successfully fulfil
the role of the successor

133
00:06:54,736 --> 00:06:56,897
depends on the abilities
of your husband.

134
00:06:57,456 --> 00:06:58,256
That's right.

135
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,400
Where are you going?

136
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,822
A successor?

137
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,481
(Tian Xing Xing)

138
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:25,576
It's true.

139
00:07:26,336 --> 00:07:27,296
An old man...

140
00:07:28,856 --> 00:07:29,896
No, a man.

141
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,280
No, a middle-aged man.

142
00:07:32,336 --> 00:07:34,777
A middle-aged man took me
to some kind of medical centre.

143
00:07:34,936 --> 00:07:37,016
Oh, my. When I walked in,
I saw a lot of people.

144
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,240
It was packed with people.

145
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,296
Do you know what they called me?
They call me

146
00:07:40,616 --> 00:07:41,416
Senior Aunt.

147
00:07:42,616 --> 00:07:43,697
Senior Master.

148
00:07:44,736 --> 00:07:45,697
They called me that.

149
00:07:45,937 --> 00:07:47,336
I was dumbfounded.

150
00:07:47,736 --> 00:07:48,777
And you know,

151
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,919
they said I was,

152
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:51,216
something like,

153
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,182
a Jiangshi...
(Jiangshi means "Zombie" in Chinese)

154
00:07:53,263 --> 00:07:54,182
Zombie?

155
00:07:54,736 --> 00:07:57,937
The Jiang family's successor.

156
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,775
You weren't there,
but it was like I was in a TV drama.

157
00:08:02,856 --> 00:08:04,319
Even TV dramas aren't
even as realistic as that.

158
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,200
Really.

159
00:08:05,616 --> 00:08:08,400
Hang on. You didn't join some
kind of pyramid scheme, did you?

160
00:08:10,777 --> 00:08:12,257
They didn't look like it.

161
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,040
The medical centre,

162
00:08:14,616 --> 00:08:15,622
its interior,

163
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:16,777
and those people...

164
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:19,616
Listen, you have no idea how good

165
00:08:19,697 --> 00:08:21,778
the acting skills of
those scammers are these days.

166
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,211
Haven't you read it on the news?

167
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:24,656
In a WeChat group,

168
00:08:24,816 --> 00:08:25,736
there were over
300 people working together

169
00:08:25,802 --> 00:08:26,897
just to deceive a single person.

170
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,960
Some even laid out the trap
for three to five years,

171
00:08:29,016 --> 00:08:30,602
and invested their own money upfront.

172
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:32,553
Oh, right. There was another news
just two days ago.

173
00:08:32,657 --> 00:08:33,778
Live-streaming fraud.

174
00:08:34,777 --> 00:08:35,657
The scammers made up

175
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,200
an entire Parisian shopping mall,

176
00:08:37,298 --> 00:08:38,896
filled with luxury brand counters.

177
00:08:41,777 --> 00:08:42,577
But...

178
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,106
But if it's a pyramid scheme,
what is he trying to gain from me?

179
00:08:46,336 --> 00:08:47,136
Money?

180
00:08:47,829 --> 00:08:48,948
I don't have any money.

181
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:53,416
Oh, no.

182
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,050
Oh, no.

183
00:08:57,977 --> 00:08:59,110
He wants to deceive me
for sexual favours.

184
00:09:00,537 --> 00:09:01,537
But you are not sexy.

185
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:02,890
You don't know that for sure!

186
00:09:03,456 --> 00:09:04,256
Tian Xing Xing,

187
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:05,336
it is possible!

188
00:09:07,336 --> 00:09:09,389
What if he wants to deceive me
for sexual pleasure?

189
00:09:10,257 --> 00:09:11,590
It must be a sour deal for him.

190
00:09:12,456 --> 00:09:13,256
I'm telling you,

191
00:09:13,537 --> 00:09:14,576
with my luck today,

192
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,097
I have to catch a claw machine.

193
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,016
I'm sure I will catch many dolls today.

194
00:09:18,097 --> 00:09:20,616
I'm not going. It's Monday tomorrow.
The director will be doing rounds.

195
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,720
Everyone must be present at their posts.

196
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,720
If it weren't for waiting for you,
I would have gone to bed already.

197
00:09:23,817 --> 00:09:25,449
-Just go with me.
-Go on your own.

198
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:26,689
Tian Xing Xing, go with me.

199
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,240
-Let go.
-No.

200
00:09:28,336 --> 00:09:29,136
-Let go of me.
-Go with me.

201
00:09:29,136 --> 00:09:30,657
Let go of me. I'm going to bed.

202
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,440
Tian Xing Xing,

203
00:09:34,136 --> 00:09:35,977
you are so heartless.

204
00:09:36,217 --> 00:09:37,017
I can't hear you.

205
00:09:39,016 --> 00:09:39,896
Tian Xing Xing!

206
00:09:48,896 --> 00:09:50,696
It could be my body too, right?

207
00:10:23,017 --> 00:10:24,656
Tian Zhen, you go first.

208
00:10:25,216 --> 00:10:26,482
His pulse is steady and calm.

209
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,919
He will have a long life.

210
00:10:28,017 --> 00:10:29,577
He is a master of master.

211
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:32,017
He's just creative.

212
00:10:34,089 --> 00:10:35,368
Your Zuoguan is inconsistent.
(Zuoguan represents function of liver)

213
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,056
You didn't sleep well
last night, did you?

214
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:38,776
Today is the last day of my internship.

215
00:10:38,897 --> 00:10:40,897
I made a small token
for everyone last night.

216
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,080
That's good.

217
00:10:42,255 --> 00:10:43,255
It's what you should do.

218
00:10:43,697 --> 00:10:44,497
Ling Lan,

219
00:10:45,137 --> 00:10:48,137
you must have slept
without socks last night.

220
00:10:48,457 --> 00:10:49,897
I'm not preparing to get pregnant.

221
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,399
I just want you
to live a healthier life.

222
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,816
Cut your daughter some slack.

223
00:10:53,927 --> 00:10:55,993
Did you have a lot
on your mind last night?

224
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:57,577
Anxiety impairs your spleen.

225
00:10:59,096 --> 00:11:00,976
None of you are obedient.

226
00:11:01,545 --> 00:11:03,017
How could I not worry?

227
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:06,810
You ate something cold
yesterday, didn't you?

228
00:11:07,697 --> 00:11:08,497
No.

229
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,040
I think you ate ice cream.

230
00:11:11,457 --> 00:11:13,056
As a veteran TCM practitioner,

231
00:11:13,137 --> 00:11:15,216
how could I possibly eat ice cream?

232
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,080
And the flavour isn't common.

233
00:11:18,776 --> 00:11:19,976
Because in your meridians,

234
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,921
there is heat within the cold.

235
00:11:22,377 --> 00:11:23,817
It was either

236
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:27,017
a durian flavour or

237
00:11:27,776 --> 00:11:28,756
a pineapple flavour.

238
00:11:31,096 --> 00:11:33,536
Could it be cold deficiency
and excessive internal heat?

239
00:11:39,897 --> 00:11:40,897
You ate two spoons.

240
00:11:41,017 --> 00:11:42,457
About 50g.

241
00:11:42,776 --> 00:11:44,336
-Dad!
-Song Yi Ren.

242
00:11:44,897 --> 00:11:46,257
I told you not to eat ice cream.

243
00:11:46,457 --> 00:11:49,416
What if your blood
sugar levels rise again?

244
00:11:49,897 --> 00:11:51,337
I didn't eat ice cream!

245
00:11:55,577 --> 00:11:57,270
Let's have breakfast. Don't be mad, Mum.

246
00:11:58,697 --> 00:11:59,497
Grandpa,

247
00:11:59,577 --> 00:12:01,457
if you're craving something
sweet again, try this yogurt.

248
00:12:01,776 --> 00:12:03,369
It contains zero sugar. It's healthy.

249
00:12:04,976 --> 00:12:07,216
My grandson is so sweet.

250
00:12:07,337 --> 00:12:08,137
Of course.

251
00:12:08,337 --> 00:12:09,575
-Let's eat.
-Okay.

252
00:12:09,656 --> 00:12:10,456
Okay.

253
00:12:18,457 --> 00:12:21,069
You are becoming increasingly
skilled at pulse diagnosis.

254
00:12:21,536 --> 00:12:23,897
You even figured out
the flavours of ice cream.

255
00:12:26,897 --> 00:12:27,697
Let me ask you,

256
00:12:28,457 --> 00:12:29,577
when I asked you

257
00:12:30,056 --> 00:12:31,616
to get the Cordyceps for me yesterday,

258
00:12:31,697 --> 00:12:34,416
did you see the durian ice cream
my dad hid?

259
00:12:34,776 --> 00:12:36,137
Your dad never

260
00:12:36,577 --> 00:12:38,257
does any housework.

261
00:12:38,697 --> 00:12:40,377
He just left the spoon there last night

262
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,120
when he ate the ice cream
behind our backs.

263
00:12:42,216 --> 00:12:43,497
I picked it up and smelled it.

264
00:12:46,257 --> 00:12:47,377
Was the smell overpowering?

265
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,559
How can I help you?

266
00:13:27,697 --> 00:13:28,697
May I go in?

267
00:13:45,976 --> 00:13:47,137
What are you looking for?

268
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,473
How did you know I live here?

269
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:51,656
I have extraordinary abilities.

270
00:13:52,577 --> 00:13:53,697
Wherever you go,

271
00:13:53,817 --> 00:13:54,856
I can always find you.

272
00:13:57,377 --> 00:13:58,616
Look at the time now.

273
00:13:58,776 --> 00:14:00,749
Why didn't you report in
at the medical centre?

274
00:14:00,897 --> 00:14:02,795
Why should I report in
at the medical centre?

275
00:14:03,216 --> 00:14:05,376
You've paid me 100 yuan for yesterday.

276
00:14:05,457 --> 00:14:06,257
It's over.

277
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:07,589
Why should I go there?

278
00:14:08,337 --> 00:14:09,937
I'm being serious with you.

279
00:14:10,035 --> 00:14:11,130
When you left yesterday,

280
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,119
I told you

281
00:14:12,457 --> 00:14:14,082
to report to the medical centre

282
00:14:14,163 --> 00:14:15,802
every morning at eight o'clock.

283
00:14:16,096 --> 00:14:17,697
I'm also serious when I said

284
00:14:18,636 --> 00:14:20,636
the 100 yuan job yesterday was over.

285
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,236
You want me to go there again?

286
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:23,895
But you haven't paid me.

287
00:14:23,976 --> 00:14:25,776
I will pay you. 100 yuan per day.
Come with me.

288
00:14:25,857 --> 00:14:26,657
I'm not going.

289
00:14:31,023 --> 00:14:33,697
I thought I was just an extra
when I went there yesterday.

290
00:14:34,216 --> 00:14:35,897
Right? So, I went there for 100 yuan.

291
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,936
But turned out that
I was playing a leading role.

292
00:14:39,017 --> 00:14:40,823
The charge for a lead actress
is different.

293
00:14:41,017 --> 00:14:42,457
How can 100 yuan be enough?

294
00:14:43,776 --> 00:14:44,576
I'm not doing it.

295
00:14:49,017 --> 00:14:49,817
Fine.

296
00:14:50,976 --> 00:14:52,337
As you said before,

297
00:14:52,817 --> 00:14:54,497
I will pay you 4,800 yuan per month,

298
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:00,296
but we will need a written agreement

299
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:03,719
so that you won't raise the price later.

300
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:05,577
We don't own a bank,

301
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,563
and we can't print money.

302
00:15:08,776 --> 00:15:10,562
Give me a pen and paper.
I will write it now.

303
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,856
Look at my house,

304
00:15:12,937 --> 00:15:14,817
does it look like a place
with pen and paper?

305
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,119
You brought your own pen.

306
00:15:32,897 --> 00:15:34,137
Go and get your ID card.

307
00:15:36,216 --> 00:15:37,337
What do you need my ID for?

308
00:15:38,257 --> 00:15:39,377
Just...

309
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:41,856
Just write down
my ID card information there.

310
00:15:41,897 --> 00:15:43,810
Didn't you say you had
extraordinary abilities?

311
00:15:44,377 --> 00:15:47,017
You know, I have a lot of
serious works to do every day.

312
00:15:47,137 --> 00:15:49,216
I can't spend all my time on you.

313
00:15:49,536 --> 00:15:50,577
Go get your ID card.

314
00:16:03,216 --> 00:16:04,096
This is your copy.

315
00:16:04,536 --> 00:16:06,337
Put it away, it will be useful later.

316
00:16:06,697 --> 00:16:07,577
How will it be useful?

317
00:16:08,577 --> 00:16:10,457
Can I sue you with this
if you don't pay me?

318
00:16:11,377 --> 00:16:12,377
I'm really...

319
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:14,257
I'm really curious.

320
00:16:14,656 --> 00:16:16,697
Why do you insist on me going with you?

321
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,017
Why does it have to be me?

322
00:16:18,457 --> 00:16:19,257
And...

323
00:16:20,216 --> 00:16:23,337
And you are not really asking me
to be the successor, are you?

324
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,496
It feels so unrealistic.

325
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,040
I'm having trouble
accepting it for now.

326
00:16:27,137 --> 00:16:28,736
I do have a lot of ambitions.

327
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:30,776
I want to... Anyway...

328
00:16:31,096 --> 00:16:32,656
Anyway, I have many wild ambitions.

329
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,415
Except for being a successor,

330
00:16:34,496 --> 00:16:36,135
especially a successor of TCM.

331
00:16:36,216 --> 00:16:37,756
I've really never thought about it.

332
00:16:40,216 --> 00:16:42,017
I have a lot of ambitions too.

333
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,120
Being a successor

334
00:16:45,457 --> 00:16:47,017
wasn't in my ambitions too,

335
00:16:47,897 --> 00:16:50,776
but I have become a successor
of TCM acupuncture technique now.

336
00:16:50,857 --> 00:16:52,017
And I'm doing a good job.

337
00:16:53,976 --> 00:16:55,137
If you don't give it a try,

338
00:16:55,337 --> 00:16:56,216
how will you know?

339
00:16:56,337 --> 00:16:57,817
I know without even needing to try.

340
00:16:58,656 --> 00:17:00,455
I'm not interested in TCM.

341
00:17:00,536 --> 00:17:02,017
What are you interested in?

342
00:17:06,822 --> 00:17:07,743
Playing claw machines.

343
00:17:09,457 --> 00:17:10,497
I caught all those dolls.

344
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:12,577
Look.

345
00:17:13,017 --> 00:17:14,656
Look here. See this.

346
00:17:14,976 --> 00:17:16,656
I could even catch a doll in this shape.

347
00:17:17,928 --> 00:17:19,634
The hardest one
to catch was this shark.

348
00:17:20,257 --> 00:17:21,737
And I caught two. Impressive, huh?

349
00:17:21,976 --> 00:17:24,096
Its head is so round.
And I still caught it.

350
00:17:24,736 --> 00:17:25,856
How much have you spent

351
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,961
on claw machines?

352
00:17:27,736 --> 00:17:28,695
Except for meals,

353
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,653
I've spent all my money
on claw machines.

354
00:17:31,976 --> 00:17:32,856
You know,

355
00:17:33,897 --> 00:17:35,216
the money you spent on claw machines

356
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,550
was enough for you
to buy yourself a claw machine.

357
00:17:36,697 --> 00:17:39,137
You could've played it at home everyday.

358
00:17:40,096 --> 00:17:41,377
You don't get it.

359
00:17:41,616 --> 00:17:43,017
If you buy a claw machine,

360
00:17:43,098 --> 00:17:44,937
all the dolls inside are already yours.

361
00:17:45,096 --> 00:17:46,536
You will be catching your own dolls.

362
00:17:46,536 --> 00:17:47,616
What's the fun in that?

363
00:17:48,096 --> 00:17:49,377
I just don't get it.

364
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,295
Who are you competing with
when you play claw machines?

365
00:17:53,377 --> 00:17:54,736
With myself.

366
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,216
It's the desire to win, you know?

367
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,040
The desire to win.

368
00:17:59,102 --> 00:17:59,902
That's right.

369
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,000
The desire to win,

370
00:18:04,096 --> 00:18:05,497
very well said.

371
00:18:08,616 --> 00:18:09,577
I really think

372
00:18:09,976 --> 00:18:11,697
you have a talent for studying TCM.

373
00:18:14,017 --> 00:18:14,817
In TCM,

374
00:18:15,856 --> 00:18:18,017
if you can accurately
identify the illness,

375
00:18:18,616 --> 00:18:19,497
confront it,

376
00:18:20,577 --> 00:18:21,416
defeat it,

377
00:18:21,497 --> 00:18:22,976
and cure the patient's condition,

378
00:18:23,697 --> 00:18:24,856
the sense of accomplishment

379
00:18:25,096 --> 00:18:26,856
is much stronger than catching a doll.

380
00:18:29,577 --> 00:18:30,616
Are you done here?

381
00:18:30,736 --> 00:18:32,017
If you are, you should go.

382
00:18:32,856 --> 00:18:34,377
Aren't you coming with me today?

383
00:18:35,216 --> 00:18:36,016
Today?

384
00:18:36,457 --> 00:18:37,257
Yes.

385
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:38,416
I can't today.

386
00:18:38,697 --> 00:18:39,497
Tomorrow.

387
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,556
Big celebrities usually
require advance appointments.

388
00:18:42,977 --> 00:18:44,823
You need to book the appointment
a day before.

389
00:18:44,977 --> 00:18:47,817
Now that you are here, if I go
with you just because you ask me to,

390
00:18:48,256 --> 00:18:49,175
I'll feel unworthy.

391
00:18:49,256 --> 00:18:51,376
Fine. See you tomorrow morning at 8am.

392
00:18:52,857 --> 00:18:53,837
at the medical centre.

393
00:18:53,977 --> 00:18:55,330
God will be watching over you.

394
00:18:55,896 --> 00:18:57,496
Isn't 8am a bit too early?

395
00:19:02,217 --> 00:19:04,217
Will you deduct my pay
if I'm a little late?

396
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,241
36.5.

397
00:19:07,857 --> 00:19:09,497
You're fine, madam.

398
00:19:09,737 --> 00:19:10,743
You don't have a fever.

399
00:19:10,922 --> 00:19:12,776
I'm sure you will get well soon.

400
00:19:13,097 --> 00:19:15,016
Today is the last day
of my internship here.

401
00:19:15,549 --> 00:19:16,349
Starting tomorrow,

402
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,000
I'll leave you in the hands of others.

403
00:19:18,097 --> 00:19:19,737
You must listen to your doctor.

404
00:19:20,223 --> 00:19:21,737
Cooperate with the treatment.

405
00:19:21,818 --> 00:19:22,697
Eat well

406
00:19:22,936 --> 00:19:23,816
and sleep well.

407
00:19:26,737 --> 00:19:27,537
What's wrong?

408
00:19:34,097 --> 00:19:34,897
Madam,

409
00:19:35,617 --> 00:19:37,496
you must listen to your doctor.

410
00:19:37,737 --> 00:19:39,057
You will recover.

411
00:19:39,496 --> 00:19:40,296
I will come back

412
00:19:40,542 --> 00:19:41,822
to visit you when I can.

413
00:20:02,617 --> 00:20:03,417
I'm sorry.

414
00:20:04,896 --> 00:20:05,857
Sorry, I'm late.

415
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:09,156
You said you were taking me out
and you were late.

416
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,175
A patient came in

417
00:20:11,256 --> 00:20:12,323
when I was about to leave.

418
00:20:12,737 --> 00:20:14,937
So, you are just
taking me shopping here?

419
00:20:28,457 --> 00:20:29,496
I caught it! I...

420
00:20:32,617 --> 00:20:33,417
Try again.

421
00:20:36,857 --> 00:20:38,857
Come on. Come on.

422
00:20:46,776 --> 00:20:47,576
Come on. Come on.

423
00:20:47,896 --> 00:20:49,296
Yes, yes. You can do it.

424
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,016
I caught it! I caught it!

425
00:20:59,496 --> 00:21:00,656
You should try it too.

426
00:21:02,217 --> 00:21:04,016
You are already here. Just try it.

427
00:21:04,737 --> 00:21:06,057
I will just watch you play.

428
00:21:21,496 --> 00:21:23,576
-Do you know which one I want most?
-Which one?

429
00:21:24,737 --> 00:21:25,577
The Doraemon.

430
00:21:26,217 --> 00:21:27,217
Which one is Doraemon?

431
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,280
I don't want to play anymore.

432
00:21:35,376 --> 00:21:36,217
Catch a rabbit.

433
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,160
-I don't want to play anymore.
-Which one do you want?

434
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,056
The Doraemon.

435
00:21:41,189 --> 00:21:42,415
Since you couldn't catch it,

436
00:21:42,737 --> 00:21:43,656
how about

437
00:21:43,857 --> 00:21:44,977
I buy you one there?

438
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:48,162
No. It's not the same feeling
when it's bought.

439
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,422
What feeling is that?

440
00:21:51,857 --> 00:21:52,697
It's the feeling like

441
00:21:53,496 --> 00:21:54,496
you just really want to

442
00:21:55,376 --> 00:21:56,376
catch it.

443
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,801
To get it out.

444
00:21:57,977 --> 00:21:58,777
Give me a minute.

445
00:21:59,563 --> 00:22:00,363
Wait here.

446
00:22:08,097 --> 00:22:08,897
Boss,

447
00:22:09,222 --> 00:22:10,022
more

448
00:22:10,617 --> 00:22:11,577
tokens for 50 yuan.

449
00:22:14,097 --> 00:22:15,550
You are having a lot of fun, huh?

450
00:22:16,617 --> 00:22:17,457
Nothing.

451
00:22:17,617 --> 00:22:18,417
What does that mean?

452
00:22:21,337 --> 00:22:22,137
Here.

453
00:22:22,496 --> 00:22:23,457
Play more rounds.

454
00:22:23,496 --> 00:22:24,296
Okay.

455
00:22:24,857 --> 00:22:25,657
Have fun.

456
00:22:33,256 --> 00:22:34,776
So many tokens.

457
00:22:35,097 --> 00:22:35,977
These are all for me?

458
00:22:38,977 --> 00:22:41,217
I've never taken money from you before.

459
00:22:42,977 --> 00:22:44,256
So many tokens.

460
00:22:46,496 --> 00:22:47,296
Blue...

461
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,760
-You can do it.
-Okay, okay.

462
00:22:53,857 --> 00:22:54,657
No, no.

463
00:22:54,977 --> 00:22:55,777
I think

464
00:22:55,977 --> 00:22:56,977
I will catch the blue one later.

465
00:22:57,063 --> 00:22:59,102
It's under another doll at the back.

466
00:22:59,256 --> 00:23:00,737
I have to

467
00:23:00,737 --> 00:23:02,617
catch that doll first.

468
00:23:04,097 --> 00:23:05,770
-Catch it.
-I need to tell you something.

469
00:23:06,617 --> 00:23:07,417
I quit my job.

470
00:23:10,896 --> 00:23:11,696
Pardon me?

471
00:23:12,376 --> 00:23:13,217
I quit my job.

472
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,776
Don't joke about that.

473
00:23:14,857 --> 00:23:17,617
I'm having fun catching dolls.

474
00:23:17,977 --> 00:23:19,223
I just got the approval today.

475
00:23:23,376 --> 00:23:24,496
That's impossible.

476
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,561
Even if the dean resigns,

477
00:23:26,703 --> 00:23:29,217
it would take at least a year
or so to get the approval, right?

478
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,240
Not to mention
that you are the principal.

479
00:23:31,337 --> 00:23:33,617
I submitted my resignation a year ago.

480
00:23:35,457 --> 00:23:36,697
A year ago?

481
00:23:40,337 --> 00:23:41,337
Why didn't you tell me?

482
00:23:41,577 --> 00:23:43,083
Why didn't you discuss this with me?

483
00:23:44,097 --> 00:23:45,617
I thought that if it was rejected,

484
00:23:45,763 --> 00:23:47,402
telling you would be unnecessary then.

485
00:23:51,256 --> 00:23:52,656
So, now that it has been approved,

486
00:23:53,217 --> 00:23:56,416
you are officially
informing me about it.

487
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,695
Is that what you are doing?

488
00:23:57,776 --> 00:23:58,577
So, next,

489
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,120
do you want me

490
00:24:00,217 --> 00:24:01,617
to go to your office

491
00:24:01,977 --> 00:24:03,337
to pack your stuff

492
00:24:03,676 --> 00:24:05,089
and take everything home for you?

493
00:24:05,466 --> 00:24:07,016
I don't mind about other things,

494
00:24:07,457 --> 00:24:09,377
but you have to bring back
the ancient books.

495
00:24:11,256 --> 00:24:12,436
Bring them back yourself!

496
00:24:31,376 --> 00:24:32,516
Penny for your thoughts.

497
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,400
How did the interview go?

498
00:24:35,737 --> 00:24:37,137
I don't think they will hire me.

499
00:24:37,458 --> 00:24:39,415
There are too few slots this year.
The elimination rate is high.

500
00:24:39,496 --> 00:24:42,209
Have a little faith in yourself.
You have to believe in yourself.

501
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,760
The teachers are all acquaintances.

502
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:46,090
You'll be the one with the best chance
of getting to the final interview.

503
00:24:47,409 --> 00:24:48,289
I hope so.

504
00:24:48,977 --> 00:24:49,896
I'm going back.

505
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:04,857
Mum, did I owe him
in the previous life?

506
00:25:06,737 --> 00:25:07,977
He was right

507
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,880
to take them home.

508
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,720
These are all good stuff.

509
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:15,136
These will all be passed on
to Tian Zhen.

510
00:25:15,217 --> 00:25:17,138
These are Tian Zhen's assets.

511
00:25:17,617 --> 00:25:19,256
There are also wire-bound books inside.

512
00:25:21,376 --> 00:25:24,057
If you have time,
visit the school again.

513
00:25:24,143 --> 00:25:25,776
There might be out-of-print books there.

514
00:25:26,376 --> 00:25:27,869
No way I'm going.
It's embarrassing.

515
00:25:28,457 --> 00:25:29,737
What's so embarrassing about it?

516
00:25:30,256 --> 00:25:31,256
It's just embarrassing.

517
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,200
Xin Zheng is home.

518
00:25:42,577 --> 00:25:44,617
Didn't you ask him

519
00:25:45,457 --> 00:25:47,496
what he was doing this for?

520
00:25:48,256 --> 00:25:50,136
In all our times together,
has he ever

521
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,041
really answered my question?

522
00:25:52,496 --> 00:25:54,896
He always does what he wants.

523
00:25:55,848 --> 00:25:56,728
Remember that time

524
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,681
he went to Tibet
to help build a hospital?

525
00:25:59,789 --> 00:26:01,109
He just grabbed his bag

526
00:26:01,496 --> 00:26:02,737
and left without saying much.

527
00:26:03,108 --> 00:26:04,709
He even took all the money away.

528
00:26:04,857 --> 00:26:05,977
It was Chinese New Year.

529
00:26:06,376 --> 00:26:07,496
Tian Zhen and I had to...

530
00:26:07,737 --> 00:26:08,537
You know, we only

531
00:26:09,003 --> 00:26:09,883
had 23 cents

532
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:11,743
in our bank account.

533
00:26:12,217 --> 00:26:13,057
Mum,

534
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,480
23 cents.

535
00:26:14,896 --> 00:26:16,296
Without you, Mum,

536
00:26:16,617 --> 00:26:19,136
Tian Zhen and I wouldn't have
lived to see this day.

537
00:26:19,256 --> 00:26:21,016
Does he care about our family?

538
00:26:21,016 --> 00:26:22,577
Does he care about me?

539
00:26:23,617 --> 00:26:25,857
He cares about all beings.

540
00:26:26,256 --> 00:26:27,457
We'll help you

541
00:26:27,538 --> 00:26:29,217
through your difficulties

542
00:26:29,376 --> 00:26:30,536
as you assist him in his work

543
00:26:30,617 --> 00:26:31,695
as a TCM practitioner.

544
00:26:31,776 --> 00:26:34,016
You don't need a husband.

545
00:26:34,111 --> 00:26:35,296
You have your own family.

546
00:26:38,943 --> 00:26:40,262
Do I?

547
00:26:41,617 --> 00:26:42,417
Dad,

548
00:26:42,617 --> 00:26:43,857
I've always suspected

549
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,719
that you had not found a son-in-law,

550
00:26:45,809 --> 00:26:47,929
you had found a daughter-in-law instead.

551
00:26:50,737 --> 00:26:52,057
Now you are not making any sense.

552
00:26:54,016 --> 00:26:56,136
Women need to be pampered.

553
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:12,830
Mum,

554
00:27:13,017 --> 00:27:13,897
I'm home.

555
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,559
All right.

556
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,359
Grandpa, Grandma.

557
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,880
What are you doing?

558
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:20,890
Your dad quit his job.

559
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,830
Okay.

560
00:27:26,217 --> 00:27:27,017
Okay?

561
00:27:29,256 --> 00:27:30,737
I said your dad quit his job.

562
00:27:30,818 --> 00:27:32,058
All you said is "okay".

563
00:27:32,376 --> 00:27:33,356
What else should I say?

564
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,440
I just realised that

565
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,720
you and your dad are exactly the same.

566
00:27:37,923 --> 00:27:38,723
You are indifferent

567
00:27:38,942 --> 00:27:39,783
and uncaring.

568
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,240
If I take after Dad
in being indifferent,

569
00:27:42,337 --> 00:27:44,095
then who do I take after
in being uncaring?

570
00:27:44,337 --> 00:27:45,496
Ren Tian Zhen!

571
00:27:50,337 --> 00:27:52,697
You're setting yourself up
for disappointment.

572
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:53,970
You are complaining

573
00:27:54,337 --> 00:27:55,577
to your son about his dad.

574
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:58,577
Should he say that his dad is wrong
or that you are wrong?

575
00:28:00,023 --> 00:28:01,337
He's got the right attitude.

576
00:28:03,142 --> 00:28:04,863
Mum, say something.

577
00:28:06,156 --> 00:28:06,956
They are wrong.

578
00:28:07,697 --> 00:28:08,497
You are right.

579
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:09,657
There you go.

580
00:28:11,496 --> 00:28:12,656
Seriously.

581
00:28:13,097 --> 00:28:14,176
Listen to me...

582
00:28:15,737 --> 00:28:16,737
Get back to work.

583
00:28:18,376 --> 00:28:19,376
They are gone.

584
00:28:30,617 --> 00:28:32,376
Dear Madam Zhang Ji Ru,

585
00:28:34,442 --> 00:28:35,923
don't be so reluctant to let go.

586
00:28:36,977 --> 00:28:38,097
Give it to me.

587
00:28:45,577 --> 00:28:46,977
Ling Lan, someone is at the door.

588
00:28:55,857 --> 00:28:56,657
Mr Liu.

589
00:28:57,097 --> 00:28:58,136
Professor Ren,

590
00:28:58,756 --> 00:28:59,702
help me.

591
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:01,720
I'm dying.

592
00:29:12,617 --> 00:29:13,697
When I was in Australia,

593
00:29:13,778 --> 00:29:15,058
they had lobsters

594
00:29:16,097 --> 00:29:17,496
as big as my arms.

595
00:29:17,737 --> 00:29:19,376
How could I possibly control myself?

596
00:29:20,457 --> 00:29:21,896
I had wine

597
00:29:21,977 --> 00:29:23,097
and lobsters.

598
00:29:23,697 --> 00:29:25,357
And I became like this
after I came back.

599
00:29:28,097 --> 00:29:29,457
Their deep sea fish oil

600
00:29:29,909 --> 00:29:30,889
is absolutely authentic.

601
00:29:32,536 --> 00:29:33,336
Take it.

602
00:29:34,136 --> 00:29:34,977
If you had

603
00:29:35,337 --> 00:29:36,776
followed my advice

604
00:29:36,977 --> 00:29:38,617
and not overindulged in eating,

605
00:29:38,698 --> 00:29:40,550
you wouldn't be knocking

606
00:29:40,651 --> 00:29:41,731
on our door day and night.

607
00:29:41,977 --> 00:29:43,517
That'd be a great gift for me.

608
00:29:45,496 --> 00:29:46,456
All right, all right.

609
00:29:46,697 --> 00:29:47,497
I will put it here.

610
00:29:47,617 --> 00:29:50,536
When one is socializing for business,
how can they not indulge in drinking?

611
00:29:50,617 --> 00:29:51,896
I can't help it.

612
00:29:52,477 --> 00:29:54,237
I have to go abroad again tomorrow.

613
00:29:55,196 --> 00:29:56,595
It's your own body.

614
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,334
I advise you to hold off
on going abroad for now.

615
00:29:58,415 --> 00:29:59,495
I have to go.

616
00:29:59,737 --> 00:30:01,857
I'm going for the sake
of my legs this time.

617
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,400
You don't know this,
but there is a medicine for gout abroad.

618
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:06,737
It works magically.

619
00:30:07,097 --> 00:30:08,570
When you are in pain,

620
00:30:08,651 --> 00:30:10,680
just take it
and you will be fine immediately.

621
00:30:10,737 --> 00:30:12,217
It's a true cure for the illness.

622
00:30:13,303 --> 00:30:15,770
And you can eat anything you want.

623
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,760
Western medicine is really good,

624
00:30:18,818 --> 00:30:21,296
unlike our TCM, which
emphasizes dietary restrictions.

625
00:30:21,577 --> 00:30:23,016
You can't even

626
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,496
have skewers with beer.

627
00:30:25,097 --> 00:30:26,097
I'm going there

628
00:30:26,376 --> 00:30:27,296
because I want

629
00:30:27,697 --> 00:30:28,577
to get

630
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,520
the distributorship of this drug

631
00:30:30,617 --> 00:30:31,457
in China.

632
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:32,577
If it works out,

633
00:30:34,097 --> 00:30:35,937
I won't have to come to you again.

634
00:30:36,217 --> 00:30:38,217
If you can achieve that,

635
00:30:38,697 --> 00:30:39,850
congratulations to you then.

636
00:30:45,617 --> 00:30:46,417
What is this?

637
00:30:46,817 --> 00:30:48,737
Are you building a house?

638
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,960
I am going to run

639
00:30:50,043 --> 00:30:52,136
a TCM apprentice class.

640
00:30:52,337 --> 00:30:53,697
I'm looking for a classroom.

641
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,800
I'm trying to find a place
for my classes.

642
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,482
You are running a class?

643
00:30:57,563 --> 00:30:59,263
What a coincidence.
I got a place for you.

644
00:30:59,617 --> 00:31:02,016
I's applying for a TCM industrial park.

645
00:31:02,496 --> 00:31:03,857
It's subsidized by the government.

646
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:06,018
How about this?
I'll give you a building.

647
00:31:06,256 --> 00:31:08,097
And you can run your class there.

648
00:31:09,217 --> 00:31:11,097
Don't mess with me.

649
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:13,496
I'm not messing with you.

650
00:31:13,577 --> 00:31:16,337
I support the cause of TCM
with all my heart.

651
00:31:16,937 --> 00:31:19,697
Besides, you've helped me
so much over the years.

652
00:31:19,937 --> 00:31:21,217
Now that you need something,

653
00:31:21,577 --> 00:31:22,857
I'm all for it.

654
00:31:23,337 --> 00:31:24,137
Right?

655
00:31:25,496 --> 00:31:27,577
I don't have the money to pay rent.

656
00:31:28,189 --> 00:31:29,069
Forget about the rent.

657
00:31:30,075 --> 00:31:32,055
With you, the great Buddha,
presiding here,

658
00:31:32,136 --> 00:31:33,337
all the surrounding immortals

659
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:35,010
will flock to it.

660
00:31:36,909 --> 00:31:37,709
I mean it.

661
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,040
So, about the classroom...

662
00:31:40,136 --> 00:31:40,977
It's settled.

663
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,033
(Liu Chang Qing)

664
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,439
Have you lost your mind, Sun Tou Tou?

665
00:31:56,217 --> 00:31:57,017
What is this?

666
00:31:57,337 --> 00:31:58,217
I'm celebrating

667
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:01,060
my achievement of securing
a new job with a salary of 4,800 yuan.

668
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:03,337
You?

669
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:09,180
The successor of TCM.

670
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:12,097
4,800 yuan per month.

671
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,801
Which of it aligns with your persona?

672
00:32:17,783 --> 00:32:18,663
Does it matter?

673
00:32:20,402 --> 00:32:21,697
Do you know what matters?

674
00:32:21,778 --> 00:32:22,578
What?

675
00:32:23,528 --> 00:32:24,808
There is a handsome guy there.

676
00:32:24,937 --> 00:32:26,817
He's tall, thin and fair-skinned.

677
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:27,930
And he's difficult.

678
00:32:30,217 --> 00:32:31,617
Seriously? Do you have his photo?

679
00:32:32,697 --> 00:32:34,337
Where am I going to get you his photo?

680
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,937
I couldn't just take his photos
like a stalker.

681
00:32:37,457 --> 00:32:38,257
Right.

682
00:32:38,817 --> 00:32:40,337
What do you mean by he's difficult?

683
00:32:42,617 --> 00:32:44,577
How should I describe it?
Difficult is...

684
00:32:45,337 --> 00:32:46,137
My back is injured.

685
00:32:46,337 --> 00:32:47,137
I can't bow.

686
00:32:48,857 --> 00:32:49,817
He's aloof and distant.

687
00:32:50,697 --> 00:32:51,977
He makes you feel like

688
00:32:52,857 --> 00:32:53,657
you can't get him.

689
00:32:53,737 --> 00:32:55,263
And it feels particularly exciting.

690
00:32:55,376 --> 00:32:57,617
It feels challenging!

691
00:32:58,577 --> 00:33:00,337
All right. You have my permission to go.

692
00:33:00,418 --> 00:33:01,938
You should

693
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,480
stabilize your position first.
Then, bring him back to me.

694
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:06,150
I will bring my boyfriend back to you.

695
00:33:07,857 --> 00:33:09,857
I thought you were going
to set me up with him.

696
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,399
Turns out that you are
saving him for yourself.

697
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,455
Isn't what's yours also mine?

698
00:33:14,536 --> 00:33:15,736
Why bother making such clear divisions?

699
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:17,469
No. He's mine.

700
00:33:17,817 --> 00:33:18,697
He's yours.

701
00:33:38,977 --> 00:33:40,217
Stop walking around here.

702
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:45,800
Leave it.

703
00:33:51,937 --> 00:33:53,016
You are no longer young.

704
00:33:53,817 --> 00:33:55,457
You just quit your job
without hesitation.

705
00:33:55,538 --> 00:33:57,617
You didn't even discuss
with me or ask me.

706
00:33:59,457 --> 00:34:00,257
Of course.

707
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,240
If you had asked me,

708
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:03,737
I would have agreed to it.

709
00:34:06,182 --> 00:34:06,982
Professor Ren,

710
00:34:08,123 --> 00:34:09,555
can you do me a favour?

711
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,920
I'm not against you doing charity work.

712
00:34:13,296 --> 00:34:15,617
Can't you contribute a little
to your own family too?

713
00:34:16,217 --> 00:34:18,576
Family is also part
of the community, right?

714
00:34:18,697 --> 00:34:19,937
I've made up my mind.

715
00:34:20,217 --> 00:34:22,136
I have to run this apprentice class.

716
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:23,920
Fine, fine.

717
00:34:24,617 --> 00:34:25,857
You are

718
00:34:26,697 --> 00:34:27,776
well respected by people.

719
00:34:28,123 --> 00:34:30,123
You even got yourself a free classroom.

720
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,073
Let me put this up front,
don't expect me to help you.

721
00:34:35,882 --> 00:34:36,956
You heard what we said.

722
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:38,880
I don't need your help.

723
00:34:39,933 --> 00:34:40,881
I need you

724
00:34:41,977 --> 00:34:42,977
to contribute some money.

725
00:34:47,057 --> 00:34:47,857
What money?

726
00:34:48,496 --> 00:34:50,016
Our family cannot afford

727
00:34:50,097 --> 00:34:52,857
to have all of our students
live with us,

728
00:34:53,256 --> 00:34:54,296
but I hope that

729
00:34:54,697 --> 00:34:56,817
those who are able
to attend the apprentice class

730
00:34:57,057 --> 00:34:59,437
can concentrate on their studies
without any distractions.

731
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,200
I want to provide them
with food and accommodation,

732
00:35:02,269 --> 00:35:03,149
at least

733
00:35:03,763 --> 00:35:05,617
during the initial period of my class,

734
00:35:06,016 --> 00:35:08,217
so that everyone can
gather together to learn.

735
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:17,450
Professor Ren,

736
00:35:19,855 --> 00:35:20,896
do you think

737
00:35:21,256 --> 00:35:22,776
we have a gold mine

738
00:35:23,016 --> 00:35:24,296
buried under this house?

739
00:35:26,903 --> 00:35:27,783
Listen to me,

740
00:35:28,256 --> 00:35:30,737
the only thing we have in our house
is a big hole like you.

741
00:35:34,776 --> 00:35:36,737
It was Shan Dao's idea to set up

742
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,656
this apprentice course
in the first place.

743
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:40,977
I thought it was a good idea.

744
00:35:41,296 --> 00:35:42,376
I supported him.

745
00:35:42,636 --> 00:35:46,456
Who knew that he just went quiet
after saying that it was very difficult?

746
00:35:47,496 --> 00:35:48,296
He gave up.

747
00:35:48,536 --> 00:35:49,897
I think this is a good thing.

748
00:35:50,256 --> 00:35:51,256
I'll be gaining merits.

749
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,441
I was thinking that

750
00:35:53,256 --> 00:35:54,776
maybe God is giving me a chance

751
00:35:55,216 --> 00:35:57,896
to contribute to TCM.

752
00:35:58,736 --> 00:35:59,817
So, I was thinking that

753
00:36:00,536 --> 00:36:01,496
I have to

754
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,280
run this apprentice class.

755
00:36:04,716 --> 00:36:06,880
Even people thought it was hard,

756
00:36:06,976 --> 00:36:08,936
why don't you find it difficult?

757
00:36:11,602 --> 00:36:13,483
Because his wife isn't you.

758
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,455
So, no matter what I do,

759
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:20,097
even if it's difficult,
I don't find it hard.

760
00:36:22,536 --> 00:36:23,456
But you see,

761
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,760
it hasn't been long since the state
recognised apprenticeship training.

762
00:36:27,855 --> 00:36:29,295
You have to figure out

763
00:36:30,097 --> 00:36:31,976
the procedures step by step

764
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,800
to run this class.

765
00:36:35,855 --> 00:36:36,655
What are

766
00:36:37,456 --> 00:36:38,577
you going to do?

767
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,655
Someone has
to take the first step, right?

768
00:36:42,736 --> 00:36:45,097
It's not like there's a red carpet
waiting for you.

769
00:36:45,822 --> 00:36:46,776
If it were that easy,

770
00:36:46,776 --> 00:36:48,897
everyone would do it.

771
00:36:49,496 --> 00:36:50,337
As you know,

772
00:36:51,456 --> 00:36:53,497
throughout my life,
I have searched far and wide

773
00:36:53,577 --> 00:36:55,617
for renowned doctors in rural areas.

774
00:36:56,256 --> 00:36:57,137
Most of them

775
00:36:57,137 --> 00:36:59,296
don't hold the title of professor,

776
00:37:00,336 --> 00:37:03,056
but every master I've apprenticed under

777
00:37:03,817 --> 00:37:05,296
is a person

778
00:37:05,736 --> 00:37:09,296
who follows the principles of TCM.

779
00:37:09,496 --> 00:37:11,976
I have spent half of my life
verifying their knowledge

780
00:37:12,057 --> 00:37:13,177
and expertise.

781
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,566
They are individuals

782
00:37:16,016 --> 00:37:17,274
of great virtue and talent.

783
00:37:17,355 --> 00:37:19,156
So, I want

784
00:37:19,456 --> 00:37:21,337
to invite them all

785
00:37:22,296 --> 00:37:23,256
to teach the students.

786
00:37:23,736 --> 00:37:24,536
Let's first build up

787
00:37:24,896 --> 00:37:26,496
a reserve force

788
00:37:26,595 --> 00:37:28,395
and explore step by step.

789
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:29,536
As we move forward,

790
00:37:30,057 --> 00:37:31,016
the path ahead

791
00:37:32,776 --> 00:37:33,696
will become clearer.

792
00:37:36,377 --> 00:37:37,177
So,

793
00:37:37,895 --> 00:37:39,976
Master Yushan is still around?

794
00:37:40,057 --> 00:37:40,936
Yes.

795
00:37:41,296 --> 00:37:43,296
Would TCM Master,

796
00:37:44,256 --> 00:37:45,857
Qiu Jian Xian, be willing to come?

797
00:37:47,337 --> 00:37:49,496
As long as I personally invite them,

798
00:37:49,817 --> 00:37:51,016
they will definitely come.

799
00:37:55,456 --> 00:37:57,256
In that case,

800
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,400
that's not bad.

801
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,582
If they are willing to come,

802
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,400
then this class will do

803
00:38:06,683 --> 00:38:09,163
a lot of good for Tian Zhen,

804
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,280
when he's pursing his doctoral studies.

805
00:38:13,817 --> 00:38:14,617
That's good.

806
00:38:14,857 --> 00:38:17,256
Don't you know your son?

807
00:38:17,936 --> 00:38:18,857
He is

808
00:38:19,289 --> 00:38:21,089
rebellious.

809
00:38:21,456 --> 00:38:22,776
He won't do

810
00:38:23,016 --> 00:38:23,857
what's good for him.

811
00:38:26,976 --> 00:38:28,216
It's my son.

812
00:38:28,736 --> 00:38:30,016
What are you so angry about?

813
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,680
You pacified her?

814
00:38:57,137 --> 00:38:59,456
Your daughter is reasonable.

815
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,273
She doesn't need me to pacify her.

816
00:39:04,109 --> 00:39:05,895
That's right.
I don't need to be pacified.

817
00:39:06,577 --> 00:39:07,936
I just carry out the order

818
00:39:08,349 --> 00:39:09,309
and obey.

819
00:39:11,016 --> 00:39:13,377
Now that you've thought
of the worst possible outcome,

820
00:39:13,696 --> 00:39:14,736
just go for it.

821
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:15,910
Yes, Mum.

822
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,640
Working for the inheritance of TCM

823
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,011
will only yield positive results,
not negative results.

824
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,010
Are all the syllabuses arranged?

825
00:39:23,216 --> 00:39:24,716
I will figure it out as I go along.

826
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,840
I will arrange it
as they attend the classes.

827
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:27,989
What about the fund?

828
00:39:28,216 --> 00:39:30,256
Don't worry about that, Master.

829
00:39:30,736 --> 00:39:31,617
Your apprentice

830
00:39:32,097 --> 00:39:33,216
just waved his arm

831
00:39:33,776 --> 00:39:34,736
and the money came in.

832
00:39:37,963 --> 00:39:39,084
He waved his arm,

833
00:39:39,456 --> 00:39:40,296
and I paid the money.

834
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,280
I still have some savings.

835
00:39:43,463 --> 00:39:45,143
I can contribute all of them.

836
00:39:46,256 --> 00:39:47,097
All?

837
00:39:47,976 --> 00:39:49,695
What about our grandson's marriage?

838
00:39:49,776 --> 00:39:51,536
That depends on his ability.

839
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,296
If my grandson is capable,

840
00:39:53,377 --> 00:39:55,897
he won't have
to worry about getting a wife.

841
00:39:56,736 --> 00:39:59,960
If he wants to grow his skills,
this is a good chance for him.

842
00:40:00,496 --> 00:40:02,496
Let him attend the class.

843
00:40:04,177 --> 00:40:06,496
Dad, he's your grandson.

844
00:40:06,736 --> 00:40:07,936
You should talk to him.

845
00:40:08,057 --> 00:40:09,296
You have to convince him.

846
00:40:09,696 --> 00:40:10,936
He won't listen to us.

847
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,879
Convince me to do what?

848
00:40:16,256 --> 00:40:17,849
You want to test acu points on me again?

849
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,536
Or you want me
to take medicine?

850
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:21,337
No, no. No medicine.

851
00:40:21,418 --> 00:40:23,377
We want you to have dinner.
Come on.

852
00:40:23,817 --> 00:40:25,337
We want you to study.

853
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,160
Study?

854
00:40:30,462 --> 00:40:32,021
Here's the thing.

855
00:40:32,296 --> 00:40:33,817
Your dear father

856
00:40:34,536 --> 00:40:35,617
has resigned.

857
00:40:37,163 --> 00:40:38,002
And then,

858
00:40:38,196 --> 00:40:39,236
he wants to

859
00:40:39,422 --> 00:40:40,736
run a TCM apprentice class.

860
00:40:40,817 --> 00:40:41,857
Your grandpa

861
00:40:41,938 --> 00:40:43,817
wants you to join the class.

862
00:40:43,936 --> 00:40:44,736
After all,

863
00:40:45,296 --> 00:40:46,456
the class will invite

864
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:49,400
many prominent TCM experts

865
00:40:49,496 --> 00:40:50,296
to give lectures,

866
00:40:51,256 --> 00:40:53,536
as well as some renowned
rural practitioners.

867
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,640
They will not

868
00:40:54,862 --> 00:40:56,857
only teach theoretical knowledge

869
00:40:56,938 --> 00:40:57,898
but also offer courses

870
00:40:58,255 --> 00:41:00,455
on herbal planting,

871
00:41:00,536 --> 00:41:03,857
medicinal herb collection,
and processing techniques.

872
00:41:05,256 --> 00:41:07,016
It's a good learning opportunity.

873
00:41:08,102 --> 00:41:09,021
However,

874
00:41:09,817 --> 00:41:12,057
your dad won't let you join.

875
00:41:13,362 --> 00:41:14,522
Why won't he let me join?

876
00:41:15,176 --> 00:41:16,376
Your level is not sufficient.

877
00:41:18,296 --> 00:41:19,337
Is Sun Tou Tou going?

878
00:41:19,456 --> 00:41:20,456
Of course.

879
00:41:20,656 --> 00:41:22,176
Even a delivery girl can join,

880
00:41:22,296 --> 00:41:24,015
so why am I not qualified
for your class?

881
00:41:24,536 --> 00:41:25,456
I don't agree

882
00:41:25,736 --> 00:41:27,057
with you going either.

883
00:41:27,256 --> 00:41:28,617
Think about it, you have to

884
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,080
climb steep cliffs and precipices
to gather herbs.

885
00:41:31,149 --> 00:41:32,909
You are my only grandson.

886
00:41:33,736 --> 00:41:35,256
I don't dare to risk it.

887
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,321
I don't agree either.

888
00:41:36,496 --> 00:41:37,296
Actually,

889
00:41:38,057 --> 00:41:38,857
that class

890
00:41:39,097 --> 00:41:40,417
is truly arduous.

891
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:43,216
Unlike at home, where you
are well clothed and well fed.

892
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,720
There is also no guarantee of success.

893
00:41:44,817 --> 00:41:46,137
You should

894
00:41:46,577 --> 00:41:48,056
just finish your studies

895
00:41:48,137 --> 00:41:49,135
and get a job

896
00:41:49,216 --> 00:41:50,855
in a proper hospital.

897
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,280
That's better, right?

898
00:41:52,817 --> 00:41:55,079
Mum, while we are on this subject,

899
00:41:55,456 --> 00:41:57,456
I'd like to share about my thoughts.

900
00:41:58,577 --> 00:42:01,117
I hope that in the future,
I will be dealing with living people

901
00:42:01,223 --> 00:42:04,337
rather than patients labelled
with various medical conditions.

902
00:42:04,857 --> 00:42:06,536
I said goodbye to Grandma Lu today.

903
00:42:07,216 --> 00:42:09,216
She may be gone soon.

904
00:42:09,536 --> 00:42:12,057
She didn't want me
to touch her with my gloved hands.

905
00:42:13,335 --> 00:42:15,176
She wanted to hold my warm hands.

906
00:42:16,216 --> 00:42:17,749
Everyone was so busy in the hospital.

907
00:42:18,057 --> 00:42:19,817
No one had time to give her a hug.

908
00:42:20,636 --> 00:42:22,696
I used to focus on
only illnesses at the hospital,

909
00:42:23,276 --> 00:42:24,876
not the people who were sick.

910
00:42:25,377 --> 00:42:26,936
All illnesses.

911
00:42:28,236 --> 00:42:29,756
I don't want to go on like this.

912
00:42:32,643 --> 00:42:34,443
Since he's so determined,

913
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,441
you shouldn't stand in the way.

914
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:37,855
Let him join the apprentice class.

915
00:42:37,936 --> 00:42:39,057
It's settled then.

916
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,160
It's settled.

917
00:42:40,256 --> 00:42:41,296
I agree then.

918
00:42:42,617 --> 00:42:43,456
Let's eat.

919
00:42:43,696 --> 00:42:44,496
Let's eat.

920
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,240
Hang on.

921
00:42:54,776 --> 00:42:57,216
How come I sense the familiar feeling
of being set up?

922
00:43:00,937 --> 00:43:02,497
Have I been tricked again?

923
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:03,640
Mum,

924
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:05,230
I think you added

925
00:43:05,736 --> 00:43:07,097
