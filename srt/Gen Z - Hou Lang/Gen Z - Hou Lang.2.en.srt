1
00:00:08,697 --> 00:00:10,524
What were you thinking
by doing that today?

2
00:00:11,416 --> 00:00:12,497
Nothing.

3
00:00:12,657 --> 00:00:15,077
I didn't want to pay respect to
a delivery girl who came out of nowhere.

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,734
What's wrong with being a delivery girl?

5
00:00:16,817 --> 00:00:18,376
Does that make her inferior?

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,401
Since when have you developed
such a condescending attitude?

7
00:00:23,776 --> 00:00:25,536
I respect every working people,

8
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,314
...but it was one thing that
she delivered the food late,

9
00:00:28,397 --> 00:00:30,436
she was even full of lies.

10
00:00:31,097 --> 00:00:32,753
When I told her I cancelled the order,

11
00:00:32,936 --> 00:00:34,697
she threw the food on me.

12
00:00:35,256 --> 00:00:36,517
That's why I dressed

13
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,839
so informally that day.

14
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:41,136
She can't even do her job well.

15
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,561
Now you want her to treat patients.

16
00:00:43,857 --> 00:00:45,977
Aren't you taking this too lightly?

17
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,597
Putting aside the fact that
you lifted her to that position,

18
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,882
even if she really becomes
a successor one day,

19
00:00:51,776 --> 00:00:53,497
I still won't bow to her.

20
00:00:53,776 --> 00:00:55,254
I wasn't asking you
to pay respect to her,

21
00:00:55,337 --> 00:00:57,537
but rather her ancestors,
the Jiang family.

22
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,720
What are you doing here?

23
00:01:06,697 --> 00:01:07,697
Do you know each other?

24
00:01:07,977 --> 00:01:08,977
Yes.

25
00:01:09,417 --> 00:01:10,417
Who is he?

26
00:01:10,777 --> 00:01:11,777
He's my son.

27
00:01:16,496 --> 00:01:17,856
If you don't bow to her,

28
00:01:18,057 --> 00:01:19,294
if you don't want to be
in this industry anymore,

29
00:01:19,377 --> 00:01:20,377
you can leave now.

30
00:01:20,977 --> 00:01:22,934
No need to compromise yourself
in this family.

31
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:25,974
When I was a kid, I told you

32
00:01:26,057 --> 00:01:27,777
that I didn't want to study TCM.

33
00:01:28,137 --> 00:01:29,697
But you coerced me.

34
00:01:30,137 --> 00:01:31,936
You all did.

35
00:01:32,337 --> 00:01:33,777
I didn't even have a choice.

36
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,413
What did I sleep on when I was a baby?

37
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:37,496
Pulse pillow.

38
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,133
My teething tool was a scraping board.

39
00:01:39,216 --> 00:01:40,055
My toys were

40
00:01:40,138 --> 00:01:41,921
medicine cabinet, brush and stone mortar.

41
00:01:43,216 --> 00:01:44,413
Now I'm almost done with my Masters,

42
00:01:44,496 --> 00:01:45,677
and I'm about to do my PhD.

43
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,800
And you're telling me I can quit
if I want to?

44
00:01:48,977 --> 00:01:50,616
Why didn't you say this 20 years ago?

45
00:01:51,256 --> 00:01:52,527
What do you want me to do now?

46
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:54,449
You can do whatever you want!

47
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,940
You have a bad back, right?

48
00:01:58,023 --> 00:01:59,893
Find a job where you
don't have to bow down!

49
00:02:03,977 --> 00:02:05,256
Tian Zhen, bow to her.

50
00:02:07,576 --> 00:02:08,576
My back is injured.

51
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,840
I can't bow.

52
00:02:15,857 --> 00:02:16,937
Xin Zheng,

53
00:02:17,857 --> 00:02:18,944
don't take it out on him.

54
00:02:19,137 --> 00:02:20,137
Yes.

55
00:02:20,556 --> 00:02:22,470
TCM practice emphasizes
a sense of propriety.

56
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,623
It shouldn't be used
as an outlet for rage

57
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:27,616
or to settle petty arguments.

58
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,080
I will keep it in mind, Master.

59
00:02:30,163 --> 00:02:31,163
Tian Zhen.

60
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:33,777
Tian Zhen.

61
00:02:38,697 --> 00:02:39,697
Etiquette

62
00:02:40,497 --> 00:02:41,573
is like walking with shoes.

63
00:02:41,656 --> 00:02:42,656
Etiquette

64
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,239
is like wearing comfortable shoes.

65
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,533
Whether they are too big or too small,

66
00:02:48,616 --> 00:02:49,857
comfortable or not,

67
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,181
only you yourself know it.

68
00:02:54,256 --> 00:02:55,256
It's okay.

69
00:02:55,816 --> 00:02:56,816
You still have

70
00:02:56,937 --> 00:02:58,816
decades to cultivate yourself.

71
00:02:59,937 --> 00:03:02,777
You will be able to find suitable shoes

72
00:03:03,295 --> 00:03:06,495
for any environment one day.

73
00:03:07,777 --> 00:03:08,777
Go on.

74
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,200
Give us the room.

75
00:03:21,016 --> 00:03:22,095
Look at your son.

76
00:03:22,862 --> 00:03:23,862
You spoiled him.

77
00:03:24,616 --> 00:03:26,008
He didn't pick up our abilities.

78
00:03:26,376 --> 00:03:27,293
All he picked up

79
00:03:27,376 --> 00:03:28,376
was your bad temper.

80
00:03:30,395 --> 00:03:31,395
My son?

81
00:03:31,977 --> 00:03:33,176
Are you not part of this?

82
00:03:33,616 --> 00:03:36,225
Who does he take after with that
foul and obstinate attitude?

83
00:03:36,497 --> 00:03:37,777
Not me, anyway.

84
00:03:37,896 --> 00:03:38,896
Look at me,

85
00:03:39,096 --> 00:03:40,656
I do whatever you ask me to do,

86
00:03:40,857 --> 00:03:41,857
don't I?

87
00:03:43,536 --> 00:03:45,697
But you can't expect our son
to do the same.

88
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,134
Besides,

89
00:03:47,217 --> 00:03:48,217
based on the way

90
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,755
(that young girl behaved today, )

91
00:03:49,857 --> 00:03:51,616
(is she fit to be the successor?)

92
00:03:51,777 --> 00:03:53,816
(And you made her sit
on the head chair, )

93
00:03:54,057 --> 00:03:56,254
(and made us all bow to her.)

94
00:03:56,337 --> 00:03:57,897
If I didn't obey you

95
00:03:58,376 --> 00:03:59,541
and gave you face,

96
00:03:59,624 --> 00:04:01,143
would any of those students

97
00:04:01,656 --> 00:04:02,697
have respected her?

98
00:04:05,417 --> 00:04:06,347
I have dedicated

99
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,327
my whole life

100
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:09,096
to TCM and you.

101
00:04:09,443 --> 00:04:11,777
But you can't ask your son
to do the same.

102
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,697
Don't you always say

103
00:04:13,977 --> 00:04:16,536
we should follow the call of our heart?

104
00:04:16,822 --> 00:04:17,997
Your son doesn't accept her.

105
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,640
You can't force him.

106
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,441
If you coerce him,

107
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,200
his back will never heal.

108
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,640
Even surgery can't help him.

109
00:04:25,977 --> 00:04:26,977
Besides,

110
00:04:27,096 --> 00:04:28,357
our son wasn't wrong.

111
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,801
If someone like Sun Tou Tou
can become a doctor,

112
00:04:32,056 --> 00:04:34,936
TCM will really become a joke.

113
00:04:36,936 --> 00:04:39,457
Despite what I just said,

114
00:04:39,697 --> 00:04:41,256
I do have doubts

115
00:04:42,056 --> 00:04:44,216
about the girl.

116
00:04:45,722 --> 00:04:46,963
Her family background does

117
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,840
give her the right to be the successor,

118
00:04:50,496 --> 00:04:52,536
but whether she can hold firm

119
00:04:53,069 --> 00:04:53,895
in this position

120
00:04:53,978 --> 00:04:55,857
depends on her performance.

121
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:58,816
If she were a normal

122
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,321
and well-behaved child,

123
00:05:00,816 --> 00:05:03,529
there wouldn't be any issues.

124
00:05:03,816 --> 00:05:06,137
But with her current behaviour,

125
00:05:06,336 --> 00:05:08,336
if you could mentor her well,

126
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:09,776
she might actually be

127
00:05:10,189 --> 00:05:12,309
the hope of TCM.

128
00:05:13,256 --> 00:05:14,256
Therefore,

129
00:05:14,376 --> 00:05:15,656
whether she can

130
00:05:16,096 --> 00:05:18,995
successfully fulfil
the role of the successor

131
00:05:19,656 --> 00:05:21,817
depends on the abilities of your husband.

132
00:05:22,376 --> 00:05:23,376
That's right.

133
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,440
Where are you going?

134
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,742
A successor?

135
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,401
(Tian Xing Xing)

136
00:05:49,656 --> 00:05:50,656
It's true.

137
00:05:51,256 --> 00:05:52,256
An old man...

138
00:05:53,776 --> 00:05:54,816
No, a man.

139
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,173
No, a middle-aged man.

140
00:05:57,256 --> 00:05:59,697
A middle-aged man took me
to some kind of medical centre.

141
00:05:59,856 --> 00:06:01,917
Oh, my. When I walked in,
I saw a lot of people.

142
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,160
It was packed with people.

143
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:05,224
Do you know what they called me?
They call me

144
00:06:05,536 --> 00:06:06,536
Senior Aunt.

145
00:06:07,536 --> 00:06:08,617
Senior Master.

146
00:06:09,656 --> 00:06:10,656
They called me that.

147
00:06:10,857 --> 00:06:12,256
I was dumbfounded.

148
00:06:12,656 --> 00:06:13,677
And you know,

149
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,839
they said I was,

150
00:06:15,336 --> 00:06:16,336
something like,

151
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,100
a Jiangshi...
(Jiangshi means "Zombie" in Chinese)

152
00:06:18,183 --> 00:06:19,183
Zombie?

153
00:06:19,656 --> 00:06:22,857
The Jiang family's successor.

154
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,693
You weren't there,
but it was like I was in a TV drama.

155
00:06:27,776 --> 00:06:29,237
Even TV dramas aren't
even as realistic as that.

156
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,320
Really.

157
00:06:30,536 --> 00:06:33,320
Hang on. You didn't join some
kind of pyramid scheme, did you?

158
00:06:35,697 --> 00:06:37,177
They didn't look like it.

159
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,160
The medical centre,

160
00:06:39,536 --> 00:06:40,542
its interior,

161
00:06:40,816 --> 00:06:41,816
and those people...

162
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,534
Listen, you have no idea how good

163
00:06:44,617 --> 00:06:46,677
the acting skills of
those scammers are these days.

164
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,152
Haven't you read it on the news?

165
00:06:48,656 --> 00:06:49,653
In a WeChat group,

166
00:06:49,736 --> 00:06:50,639
there were over
300 people working together

167
00:06:50,722 --> 00:06:52,114
just to deceive a single person.

168
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,853
Some even laid out the trap
for three to five years,

169
00:06:53,936 --> 00:06:55,545
and invested their own money upfront.

170
00:06:55,722 --> 00:06:57,494
Oh, right. There was another news
just two days ago.

171
00:06:57,577 --> 00:06:58,698
Live-streaming fraud.

172
00:06:59,697 --> 00:07:00,557
The scammers made up

173
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,120
an entire Parisian shopping mall,

174
00:07:02,218 --> 00:07:03,816
filled with luxury brand counters.

175
00:07:06,697 --> 00:07:07,697
But...

176
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,140
But if it's a pyramid scheme,
what is he trying to gain from me?

177
00:07:11,256 --> 00:07:12,256
Money?

178
00:07:12,749 --> 00:07:13,868
I don't have any money.

179
00:07:17,536 --> 00:07:18,536
Oh, no.

180
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:20,170
Oh, no.

181
00:07:22,897 --> 00:07:24,680
He wants to deceive me
for sexual favours.

182
00:07:25,457 --> 00:07:26,457
But you are not sexy.

183
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:27,831
You don't know that for sure!

184
00:07:28,376 --> 00:07:29,173
Tian Xing Xing,

185
00:07:29,256 --> 00:07:30,256
it is possible!

186
00:07:32,256 --> 00:07:34,430
What if he wants to deceive me
for sexual pleasure?

187
00:07:35,177 --> 00:07:36,525
It must be a sour deal for him.

188
00:07:37,376 --> 00:07:38,374
I'm telling you,

189
00:07:38,457 --> 00:07:39,477
with my luck today,

190
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,017
I have to catch a claw machine.

191
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,934
I'm sure I will catch many dolls today.

192
00:07:43,017 --> 00:07:45,557
I'm not going. It's Monday tomorrow.
The director will be doing rounds.

193
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,637
Everyone must be present at their posts.

194
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,654
If it weren't for waiting for you,
I would have gone to bed already.

195
00:07:48,737 --> 00:07:50,367
-Just go with me.
-Go on your own.

196
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:51,624
Tian Xing Xing, go with me.

197
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,173
-Let go.
-No.

198
00:07:53,256 --> 00:07:53,974
-Let go of me.
-Go with me.

199
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:55,577
Let go of me. I'm going to bed.

200
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,360
Tian Xing Xing,

201
00:07:59,056 --> 00:08:00,897
you are so heartless.

202
00:08:01,137 --> 00:08:02,137
I can't hear you.

203
00:08:03,936 --> 00:08:04,936
Tian Xing Xing!

204
00:08:13,816 --> 00:08:15,616
It could be my body too, right?

205
00:08:47,937 --> 00:08:49,576
Tian Zhen, you go first.

206
00:08:50,136 --> 00:08:51,402
His pulse is steady and calm.

207
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,839
He will have a long life.

208
00:08:52,937 --> 00:08:54,497
He is a master of master.

209
00:08:55,617 --> 00:08:56,937
He's just creative.

210
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:00,517
Your Zuoguan is inconsistent.
(Zuoguan represents function of liver)

211
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,974
You didn't sleep well
last night, did you?

212
00:09:02,057 --> 00:09:03,734
Today is the last day of my internship.

213
00:09:03,817 --> 00:09:05,817
I made a small token
for everyone last night.

214
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,092
That's good.

215
00:09:07,175 --> 00:09:08,219
It's what you should do.

216
00:09:08,617 --> 00:09:09,617
Ling Ian,

217
00:09:10,057 --> 00:09:13,057
you must have slept
without socks last night.

218
00:09:13,377 --> 00:09:14,856
I'm not preparing to get pregnant.

219
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,317
I just want you to live a healthier life.

220
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,736
Cut your daughter some slack.

221
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,913
Did you have a lot
on your mind last night?

222
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:22,497
Anxiety impairs your spleen.

223
00:09:24,016 --> 00:09:25,896
None of you are obedient.

224
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:27,937
How could I not worry?

225
00:09:29,817 --> 00:09:31,731
You ate something cold
yesterday, didn't you?

226
00:09:32,617 --> 00:09:33,437
No.

227
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,960
I think you ate ice cream.

228
00:09:36,377 --> 00:09:37,974
As a veteran TCM practitioner,

229
00:09:38,057 --> 00:09:40,136
how could I possibly eat ice cream?

230
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,000
And the flavour isn't common.

231
00:09:43,696 --> 00:09:44,896
Because in your meridians,

232
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,841
there is heat within the cold.

233
00:09:47,297 --> 00:09:48,737
It was either

234
00:09:48,937 --> 00:09:51,937
a durian flavour or

235
00:09:52,696 --> 00:09:53,696
a pineapple flavour.

236
00:09:56,016 --> 00:09:58,456
Could it be cold deficiency
and excessive internal heat?

237
00:10:04,817 --> 00:10:05,817
You ate two spoons.

238
00:10:05,937 --> 00:10:07,377
About 50g.

239
00:10:07,696 --> 00:10:09,256
-Dad!
-Song Yi Ren.

240
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:11,209
I told you not to eat ice cream.

241
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:14,336
What if your blood
sugar levels rise again?

242
00:10:14,817 --> 00:10:16,257
I didn't eat ice cream!

243
00:10:20,497 --> 00:10:22,237
Let's have breakfast. Don't be mad, Mum.

244
00:10:23,617 --> 00:10:24,414
Grandpa,

245
00:10:24,497 --> 00:10:26,613
if you're craving something
sweet again, try this yogurt.

246
00:10:26,696 --> 00:10:28,305
It contains zero sugar. It's healthy.

247
00:10:29,896 --> 00:10:32,136
My grandson is so sweet.

248
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:33,174
Of course.

249
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:34,493
-Let's eat.
-Okay.

250
00:10:34,576 --> 00:10:35,576
Okay.

251
00:10:43,377 --> 00:10:45,989
You are becoming increasingly
skilled at pulse diagnosis.

252
00:10:46,456 --> 00:10:48,817
You even figured out
the flavours of ice cream.

253
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:52,817
Let me ask you,

254
00:10:53,377 --> 00:10:54,497
when I asked you

255
00:10:54,976 --> 00:10:56,534
to get the Cordyceps for me yesterday,

256
00:10:56,617 --> 00:10:59,336
did you see the durian ice cream
my dad hid?

257
00:10:59,696 --> 00:11:01,057
Your dad never

258
00:11:01,497 --> 00:11:03,177
does any housework.

259
00:11:03,617 --> 00:11:05,277
He just left the spoon there last night

260
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,053
when he ate the ice cream
behind our backs.

261
00:11:07,136 --> 00:11:08,441
I picked it up and smelled it.

262
00:11:11,177 --> 00:11:12,351
Was the smell overpowering?

263
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,640
How can I help you?

264
00:11:52,617 --> 00:11:53,617
May I go in?

265
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,057
What are you looking for?

266
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,461
How did you know I live here?

267
00:12:15,016 --> 00:12:16,576
I have extraordinary abilities.

268
00:12:17,497 --> 00:12:18,617
Wherever you go,

269
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:19,776
I can always find you.

270
00:12:22,297 --> 00:12:23,536
Look at the time now.

271
00:12:23,696 --> 00:12:25,696
Why didn't you report in
at the medical centre?

272
00:12:25,817 --> 00:12:27,731
Why should I report in
at the medical centre?

273
00:12:28,136 --> 00:12:30,294
You've paid me 100 yuan for yesterday.

274
00:12:30,377 --> 00:12:31,347
It's over.

275
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:32,509
Why should I go there?

276
00:12:33,257 --> 00:12:34,857
I'm being serious with you.

277
00:12:34,955 --> 00:12:36,037
When you left yesterday,

278
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,120
I told you

279
00:12:37,377 --> 00:12:39,000
to report to the medical centre

280
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:40,722
every morning at eight o'clock.

281
00:12:41,016 --> 00:12:42,617
I'm also serious when I said

282
00:12:43,556 --> 00:12:45,556
the 100 yuan job yesterday was over.

283
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,156
You want me to go there again?

284
00:12:47,939 --> 00:12:48,813
But you haven't paid me.

285
00:12:48,896 --> 00:12:50,694
I will pay you. 100 yuan per day.
Come with me.

286
00:12:50,777 --> 00:12:51,777
I'm not going.

287
00:12:55,943 --> 00:12:58,617
I thought I was just an extra
when I went there yesterday.

288
00:12:59,136 --> 00:13:00,817
Right? So, I went there for 100 yuan.

289
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,854
But turned out that
I was playing a leading role.

290
00:13:03,937 --> 00:13:05,764
The charge for a lead actress
is different.

291
00:13:05,937 --> 00:13:07,377
How can 100 yuan be enough?

292
00:13:08,696 --> 00:13:09,696
I'm not doing it.

293
00:13:13,937 --> 00:13:14,937
Fine.

294
00:13:15,896 --> 00:13:17,257
As you said before,

295
00:13:17,737 --> 00:13:19,417
I will pay you 4,800 yuan per month,

296
00:13:23,617 --> 00:13:25,216
but we will need a written agreement

297
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,639
so that you won't raise the price later.

298
00:13:29,057 --> 00:13:30,497
We don't own a bank,

299
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,483
and we can't print money.

300
00:13:33,696 --> 00:13:35,610
Give me a pen and paper.
I will write it now.

301
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,774
Look at my house,

302
00:13:37,857 --> 00:13:39,771
does it look like a place
with pen and paper?

303
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,039
You brought your own pen.

304
00:13:57,817 --> 00:13:59,057
Go and get your ID card.

305
00:14:01,136 --> 00:14:02,310
What do you need my ID for?

306
00:14:03,177 --> 00:14:04,297
Just...

307
00:14:04,817 --> 00:14:06,734
Just write down
my ID card information there.

308
00:14:06,817 --> 00:14:08,817
Didn't you say you had
extraordinary abilities?

309
00:14:09,297 --> 00:14:11,937
You know, I have a lot of
serious works to do every day.

310
00:14:12,057 --> 00:14:14,136
I can't spend all my time on you.

311
00:14:14,456 --> 00:14:15,497
Go get your ID card.

312
00:14:28,136 --> 00:14:29,136
This is your copy.

313
00:14:29,456 --> 00:14:31,257
Put it away, it will be useful later.

314
00:14:31,617 --> 00:14:32,617
How will it be useful?

315
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:35,377
Can I sue you with this
if you don't pay me?

316
00:14:36,297 --> 00:14:37,295
I'm really...

317
00:14:37,378 --> 00:14:39,177
I'm really curious.

318
00:14:39,576 --> 00:14:41,617
Why do you insist on me going with you?

319
00:14:41,896 --> 00:14:43,027
Why does it have to be me?

320
00:14:43,377 --> 00:14:44,377
And...

321
00:14:45,136 --> 00:14:48,257
And you are not really asking me
to be the successor, are you?

322
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,397
It feels so unrealistic.

323
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,974
I'm having trouble accepting it for now.

324
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,656
I do have a lot of ambitions.

325
00:14:54,576 --> 00:14:55,696
I want to... Anyway...

326
00:14:56,016 --> 00:14:57,576
Anyway, I have many wild ambitions.

327
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,333
Except for being a successor,

328
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,053
especially a successor of TCM.

329
00:15:01,136 --> 00:15:02,676
I've really never thought about it.

330
00:15:05,136 --> 00:15:06,937
I have a lot of ambitions too.

331
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,040
Being a successor

332
00:15:10,377 --> 00:15:11,937
wasn't in my ambitions too,

333
00:15:12,817 --> 00:15:15,694
but I have become a successor
of TCM acupuncture technique now.

334
00:15:15,777 --> 00:15:16,937
And I'm doing a good job.

335
00:15:18,896 --> 00:15:20,070
If you don't give it a try,

336
00:15:20,257 --> 00:15:21,174
how will you know?

337
00:15:21,257 --> 00:15:22,779
I know without even needing to try.

338
00:15:23,576 --> 00:15:25,373
I'm not interested in TCM.

339
00:15:25,456 --> 00:15:26,937
What are you interested in?

340
00:15:31,742 --> 00:15:32,742
Playing claw machines.

341
00:15:34,377 --> 00:15:35,464
I caught all those dolls.

342
00:15:36,617 --> 00:15:37,617
Look.

343
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,576
Look here. See this.

344
00:15:39,896 --> 00:15:41,636
I could even catch a doll in this shape.

345
00:15:42,848 --> 00:15:44,588
The hardest one to catch was this shark.

346
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:46,657
And I caught two. Impressive, huh?

347
00:15:46,896 --> 00:15:49,016
Its head is so round.
And I still caught it.

348
00:15:49,656 --> 00:15:50,757
How much have you spent

349
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,881
on claw machines?

350
00:15:52,656 --> 00:15:53,597
Except for meals,

351
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,573
I've spent all my money on claw machines.

352
00:15:56,896 --> 00:15:57,896
You know,

353
00:15:58,817 --> 00:16:00,117
the money you spent on claw machines

354
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,534
was enough for you
to buy yourself a claw machine.

355
00:16:01,617 --> 00:16:04,057
You could've played it at home everyday.

356
00:16:05,016 --> 00:16:06,297
You don't get it.

357
00:16:06,536 --> 00:16:07,935
If you buy a claw machine,

358
00:16:08,018 --> 00:16:09,857
all the dolls inside are already yours.

359
00:16:10,016 --> 00:16:11,373
You will be catching your own dolls.

360
00:16:11,456 --> 00:16:12,536
What's the fun in that?

361
00:16:13,016 --> 00:16:14,297
I just don't get it.

362
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,214
Who are you competing with
when you play claw machines?

363
00:16:18,297 --> 00:16:19,656
With myself.

364
00:16:20,536 --> 00:16:22,136
It's the desire to win, you know?

365
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,939
The desire to win.

366
00:16:24,022 --> 00:16:25,022
That's right.

367
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,920
The desire to win,

368
00:16:29,016 --> 00:16:30,417
very well said.

369
00:16:33,536 --> 00:16:34,536
I really think

370
00:16:34,896 --> 00:16:36,617
you have a talent for studying TCM.

371
00:16:38,937 --> 00:16:39,937
In TCM,

372
00:16:40,776 --> 00:16:42,937
if you can accurately
identify the illness,

373
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:44,536
confront it,

374
00:16:45,497 --> 00:16:46,334
defeat it,

375
00:16:46,417 --> 00:16:47,896
and cure the patient's condition,

376
00:16:48,617 --> 00:16:49,791
the sense of accomplishment

377
00:16:50,016 --> 00:16:51,776
is much stronger than catching a doll.

378
00:16:54,497 --> 00:16:55,536
Are you done here?

379
00:16:55,656 --> 00:16:56,937
If you are, you should go.

380
00:16:57,776 --> 00:16:59,297
Aren't you coming with me today?

381
00:17:00,136 --> 00:17:01,136
Today?

382
00:17:01,377 --> 00:17:02,377
Yes.

383
00:17:02,536 --> 00:17:03,534
I can't today.

384
00:17:03,617 --> 00:17:04,617
Tomorrow.

385
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,541
Big celebrities usually
require advance appointments.

386
00:17:07,897 --> 00:17:09,814
You need to book the appointment
a day before.

387
00:17:09,897 --> 00:17:12,767
Now that you are here, if I go
with you just because you ask me to,

388
00:17:13,176 --> 00:17:14,093
I'll feel unworthy.

389
00:17:14,176 --> 00:17:16,296
Fine. See you tomorrow morning at 8am.

390
00:17:17,777 --> 00:17:18,777
At the medical centre.

391
00:17:18,897 --> 00:17:20,250
God will be watching over you.

392
00:17:20,816 --> 00:17:22,416
Isn't 8am a bit too early?

393
00:17:27,137 --> 00:17:29,137
Will you deduct my pay
if I'm a little late?

394
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,161
36.5.

395
00:17:32,777 --> 00:17:34,417
You're fine, madam.

396
00:17:34,657 --> 00:17:35,663
You don't have a fever.

397
00:17:35,842 --> 00:17:37,696
I'm sure you will get well soon.

398
00:17:38,017 --> 00:17:39,936
Today is the last day
of my internship here.

399
00:17:40,469 --> 00:17:41,397
Starting tomorrow,

400
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,934
I'll leave you in the hands of others.

401
00:17:43,017 --> 00:17:44,657
You must listen to your doctor.

402
00:17:45,143 --> 00:17:46,655
Cooperate with the treatment.

403
00:17:46,738 --> 00:17:47,738
Eat well

404
00:17:47,856 --> 00:17:48,856
and sleep well.

405
00:17:51,657 --> 00:17:52,657
What's wrong?

406
00:17:59,017 --> 00:18:00,017
Madam,

407
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:02,416
you must listen to your doctor.

408
00:18:02,657 --> 00:18:03,977
You will recover.

409
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,379
I will come back

410
00:18:05,462 --> 00:18:06,742
to visit you when I can.

411
00:18:27,537 --> 00:18:28,537
I'm sorry.

412
00:18:29,816 --> 00:18:30,816
Sorry, I'm late.

413
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:34,076
You said you were taking me out
and you were late.

414
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,093
A patient came in

415
00:18:36,176 --> 00:18:37,307
when I was about to leave.

416
00:18:37,657 --> 00:18:39,857
So, you are just taking me shopping here?

417
00:18:53,377 --> 00:18:54,416
I caught it! I...

418
00:18:57,537 --> 00:18:58,537
Try again.

419
00:19:01,777 --> 00:19:03,777
Come on. Come on.

420
00:19:11,696 --> 00:19:12,696
Come on. Come on.

421
00:19:12,816 --> 00:19:14,216
Yes, yes. You can do it.

422
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,936
I caught it! I caught it!

423
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:25,576
You should try it too.

424
00:19:27,137 --> 00:19:28,936
You are already here. Just try it.

425
00:19:29,657 --> 00:19:30,977
I will just watch you play.

426
00:19:46,416 --> 00:19:48,496
-Do you know which one I want most?
-Which one?

427
00:19:49,657 --> 00:19:50,657
The Doraemon.

428
00:19:51,137 --> 00:19:52,137
Which one is Doraemon?

429
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,213
I don't want to play anymore.

430
00:20:00,296 --> 00:20:01,296
Catch a rabbit.

431
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,093
-I don't want to play anymore.
-Which one do you want?

432
00:20:04,176 --> 00:20:05,176
The Doraemon.

433
00:20:06,109 --> 00:20:07,335
Since you couldn't catch it,

434
00:20:07,657 --> 00:20:08,657
how about

435
00:20:08,777 --> 00:20:09,897
I buy you one there?

436
00:20:10,503 --> 00:20:13,082
No. It's not the same feeling
when it's bought.

437
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,342
What feeling is that?

438
00:20:16,777 --> 00:20:17,777
It's the feeling like

439
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:19,416
you just really want to

440
00:20:20,296 --> 00:20:21,277
catch it.

441
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,721
To get it out.

442
00:20:22,897 --> 00:20:23,897
Give me a minute.

443
00:20:24,483 --> 00:20:25,483
Wait here.

444
00:20:33,017 --> 00:20:34,017
Boss,

445
00:20:34,142 --> 00:20:35,142
more

446
00:20:35,537 --> 00:20:36,537
tokens for 50 yuan.

447
00:20:39,017 --> 00:20:40,470
You are having a lot of fun, huh?

448
00:20:41,537 --> 00:20:42,454
Nothing.

449
00:20:42,537 --> 00:20:43,537
What does that mean?

450
00:20:46,257 --> 00:20:47,257
Here.

451
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:48,333
Play more rounds.

452
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:49,416
Okay.

453
00:20:49,777 --> 00:20:50,777
Have fun.

454
00:20:58,176 --> 00:20:59,696
So many tokens.

455
00:21:00,017 --> 00:21:01,017
These are all for me?

456
00:21:03,897 --> 00:21:06,137
I've never taken money from you before.

457
00:21:07,897 --> 00:21:09,176
So many tokens.

458
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:12,416
Blue...

459
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,680
-You can do it.
-Okay, okay.

460
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:19,777
No, no.

461
00:21:19,897 --> 00:21:20,814
I think

462
00:21:20,897 --> 00:21:21,900
I will catch the blue one later.

463
00:21:21,983 --> 00:21:24,022
It's under another doll at the back.

464
00:21:24,176 --> 00:21:25,574
I have to

465
00:21:25,657 --> 00:21:27,537
catch that doll first.

466
00:21:29,017 --> 00:21:30,757
-Catch it.
-I need to tell you something.

467
00:21:31,537 --> 00:21:32,537
I quit my job.

468
00:21:35,816 --> 00:21:36,816
Pardon me?

469
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,296
I quit my job.

470
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,694
Don't joke about that.

471
00:21:39,777 --> 00:21:42,537
I'm having fun catching dolls.

472
00:21:42,897 --> 00:21:44,202
I just got the approval today.

473
00:21:48,296 --> 00:21:49,416
That's impossible.

474
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,481
Even if the dean resigns,

475
00:21:51,623 --> 00:21:54,319
it would take at least a year
or so to get the approval, right?

476
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,174
Not to mention
that you are the principal.

477
00:21:56,257 --> 00:21:58,537
I submitted my resignation a year ago.

478
00:22:00,377 --> 00:22:01,617
A year ago?

479
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:06,257
Why didn't you tell me?

480
00:22:06,497 --> 00:22:08,063
Why didn't you discuss this with me?

481
00:22:09,017 --> 00:22:10,537
I thought that if it was rejected,

482
00:22:10,683 --> 00:22:12,336
telling you would be unnecessary then.

483
00:22:16,176 --> 00:22:17,655
So, now that it has been approved,

484
00:22:18,137 --> 00:22:21,336
you are officially informing me about it.

485
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,613
Is that what you are doing?

486
00:22:22,696 --> 00:22:23,677
So, next,

487
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,040
do you want me

488
00:22:25,137 --> 00:22:26,537
to go to your office

489
00:22:26,897 --> 00:22:28,257
to pack your stuff

490
00:22:28,596 --> 00:22:30,031
and take everything home for you?

491
00:22:30,386 --> 00:22:31,936
I don't mind about other things,

492
00:22:32,377 --> 00:22:34,297
but you have to bring back
the ancient books.

493
00:22:36,176 --> 00:22:37,356
Bring them back yourself!

494
00:22:56,296 --> 00:22:57,436
Penny for your thoughts.

495
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,320
How did the interview go?

496
00:23:00,657 --> 00:23:02,057
I don't think they will hire me.

497
00:23:02,378 --> 00:23:04,333
There are too few slots this year.
The elimination rate is high.

498
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:07,199
Have a little faith in yourself.
You have to believe in yourself.

499
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,694
The teachers are all acquaintances.

500
00:23:08,777 --> 00:23:11,908
You'll be the one with the best chance
of getting to the final interview.

501
00:23:12,329 --> 00:23:13,329
I hope so.

502
00:23:13,897 --> 00:23:14,897
I'm going back.

503
00:23:27,296 --> 00:23:29,777
Mum, did I owe him in the previous life?

504
00:23:31,657 --> 00:23:32,877
He was right

505
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,800
to take them home.

506
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,640
These are all good stuff.

507
00:23:36,897 --> 00:23:40,054
These will all be passed on to Tian Zhen.

508
00:23:40,137 --> 00:23:42,058
These are Tian Zhen's assets.

509
00:23:42,537 --> 00:23:44,233
There are also wire-bound books inside.

510
00:23:46,296 --> 00:23:48,977
If you have time, visit the school again.

511
00:23:49,063 --> 00:23:50,803
There might be out-of-print books there.

512
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,818
No way I'm going.
It's embarrassing.

513
00:23:53,377 --> 00:23:54,769
What's so embarrassing about it?

514
00:23:55,176 --> 00:23:56,176
It's just embarrassing.

515
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,120
Xin Zheng is home.

516
00:24:07,497 --> 00:24:09,537
Didn't you ask him

517
00:24:10,377 --> 00:24:12,416
what he was doing this for?

518
00:24:13,176 --> 00:24:15,056
In all our times together, has he ever

519
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,961
really answered my question?

520
00:24:17,416 --> 00:24:19,816
He always does what he wants.

521
00:24:20,768 --> 00:24:21,768
Remember that time

522
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,626
he went to Tibet
to help build a hospital?

523
00:24:24,709 --> 00:24:26,029
He just grabbed his bag

524
00:24:26,416 --> 00:24:27,677
and left without saying much.

525
00:24:28,028 --> 00:24:29,629
He even took all the money away.

526
00:24:29,777 --> 00:24:30,897
It was Chinese New Year.

527
00:24:31,296 --> 00:24:32,416
Tian Zhen and I had to...

528
00:24:32,657 --> 00:24:33,657
You know, we only

529
00:24:33,923 --> 00:24:34,923
had 23 cents

530
00:24:35,222 --> 00:24:36,663
in our bank account.

531
00:24:37,137 --> 00:24:37,917
Mum,

532
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,400
23 cents.

533
00:24:39,816 --> 00:24:41,216
Without you, Mum,

534
00:24:41,537 --> 00:24:44,056
Tian Zhen and I wouldn't have
lived to see this day.

535
00:24:44,176 --> 00:24:45,853
Does he care about our family?

536
00:24:45,936 --> 00:24:47,497
Does he care about me?

537
00:24:48,537 --> 00:24:50,777
He cares about all beings.

538
00:24:51,176 --> 00:24:52,375
We'll help you

539
00:24:52,458 --> 00:24:54,137
through your difficulties

540
00:24:54,296 --> 00:24:55,454
as you assist him in his work

541
00:24:55,537 --> 00:24:56,613
as a TCM practitioner.

542
00:24:56,696 --> 00:24:58,936
You don't need a husband.

543
00:24:59,031 --> 00:25:00,216
You have your own family.

544
00:25:03,863 --> 00:25:05,182
Do I?

545
00:25:06,537 --> 00:25:07,454
Dad,

546
00:25:07,537 --> 00:25:08,777
I've always suspected

547
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,646
that you had not found a son-in-law,

548
00:25:10,729 --> 00:25:12,849
you had found a daughter-in-law instead.

549
00:25:15,657 --> 00:25:17,092
Now you are not making any sense.

550
00:25:18,936 --> 00:25:21,056
Women need to be pampered.

551
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:37,854
Mum,

552
00:25:37,937 --> 00:25:38,937
I'm home.

553
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,600
All right.

554
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,279
Grandpa, Grandma.

555
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,800
What are you doing?

556
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:45,930
Your dad quit his job.

557
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,920
Okay.

558
00:25:51,137 --> 00:25:52,137
Okay?

559
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:55,655
I said your dad quit his job.

560
00:25:55,738 --> 00:25:56,978
All you said is "okay".

561
00:25:57,296 --> 00:25:58,296
What else should I say?

562
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,360
I just realised that

563
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,640
you and your dad are exactly the same.

564
00:26:02,843 --> 00:26:03,779
You are indifferent

565
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:04,862
and uncaring.

566
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,174
If I take after Dad in being indifferent,

567
00:26:07,257 --> 00:26:09,084
then who do I take after
in being uncaring?

568
00:26:09,257 --> 00:26:10,416
Ren Tian Zhen!

569
00:26:15,257 --> 00:26:17,617
You're setting yourself up
for disappointment.

570
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:19,090
You are complaining

571
00:26:19,257 --> 00:26:20,497
to your son about his dad.

572
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:23,497
Should he say that his dad is wrong
or that you are wrong?

573
00:26:24,943 --> 00:26:26,257
He's got the right attitude.

574
00:26:28,062 --> 00:26:29,783
Mum, say something.

575
00:26:31,076 --> 00:26:32,076
They are wrong.

576
00:26:32,617 --> 00:26:33,617
You are right.

577
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:34,750
There you go.

578
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,576
Seriously.

579
00:26:38,017 --> 00:26:39,096
Listen to me...

580
00:26:40,657 --> 00:26:41,657
Get back to work.

581
00:26:43,296 --> 00:26:44,296
They are gone.

582
00:26:55,537 --> 00:26:57,296
Dear Madam Zhang Ji Ru,

583
00:26:59,362 --> 00:27:00,843
don't be so reluctant to let go.

584
00:27:01,897 --> 00:27:03,017
Give it to me.

585
00:27:10,497 --> 00:27:11,932
Ling Ian, someone is at the door.

586
00:27:20,777 --> 00:27:21,777
Mr Liu.

587
00:27:22,017 --> 00:27:23,056
Professor Ren,

588
00:27:23,676 --> 00:27:24,676
help me.

589
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,760
I'm dying.

590
00:27:37,537 --> 00:27:38,615
When I was in Australia,

591
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:39,978
they had lobsters

592
00:27:41,017 --> 00:27:42,416
as big as my arms.

593
00:27:42,657 --> 00:27:44,296
How could I possibly control myself?

594
00:27:45,377 --> 00:27:46,814
I had wine

595
00:27:46,897 --> 00:27:48,017
and lobsters.

596
00:27:48,617 --> 00:27:50,400
And I became like this after I came back.

597
00:27:53,017 --> 00:27:54,377
Their deep sea fish oil

598
00:27:54,829 --> 00:27:55,873
is absolutely authentic.

599
00:27:57,456 --> 00:27:58,456
Take it.

600
00:27:59,056 --> 00:28:00,056
If you had

601
00:28:00,257 --> 00:28:01,696
followed my advice

602
00:28:01,897 --> 00:28:03,535
and not overindulged in eating,

603
00:28:03,618 --> 00:28:05,470
you wouldn't be knocking

604
00:28:05,571 --> 00:28:06,702
on our door day and night.

605
00:28:06,897 --> 00:28:08,437
That'd be a great gift for me.

606
00:28:10,416 --> 00:28:11,416
All right, all right.

607
00:28:11,617 --> 00:28:12,454
I will put it here.

608
00:28:12,537 --> 00:28:15,454
When one is socializing for business,
how can they not indulge in drinking?

609
00:28:15,537 --> 00:28:16,816
I can't help it.

610
00:28:17,397 --> 00:28:19,157
I have to go abroad again tomorrow.

611
00:28:20,116 --> 00:28:21,515
It's your own body.

612
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,252
I advise you to hold off
on going abroad for now.

613
00:28:23,335 --> 00:28:24,415
I have to go.

614
00:28:24,657 --> 00:28:26,777
I'm going for the sake
of my legs this time.

615
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,449
You don't know this,
but there is a medicine for gout abroad.

616
00:28:30,657 --> 00:28:31,657
It works magically.

617
00:28:32,017 --> 00:28:33,488
When you are in pain,

618
00:28:33,571 --> 00:28:35,574
just take it
and you will be fine immediately.

619
00:28:35,657 --> 00:28:37,137
It's a true cure for the illness.

620
00:28:38,223 --> 00:28:40,690
And you can eat anything you want.

621
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,655
Western medicine is really good,

622
00:28:43,738 --> 00:28:46,216
unlike our TCM, which
emphasizes dietary restrictions.

623
00:28:46,497 --> 00:28:47,917
You can't even

624
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,416
have skewers with beer.

625
00:28:50,017 --> 00:28:51,017
I'm going there

626
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:52,296
because I want

627
00:28:52,617 --> 00:28:53,617
to get

628
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,440
the distributorship of this drug

629
00:28:55,537 --> 00:28:56,375
in China.

630
00:28:56,458 --> 00:28:57,497
If it works out,

631
00:28:59,017 --> 00:29:00,857
I won't have to come to you again.

632
00:29:01,137 --> 00:29:03,137
If you can achieve that,

633
00:29:03,617 --> 00:29:04,835
congratulations to you then.

634
00:29:10,537 --> 00:29:11,537
What is this?

635
00:29:11,737 --> 00:29:13,657
Are you building a house?

636
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,880
I am going to run

637
00:29:14,963 --> 00:29:17,056
a TCM apprentice class.

638
00:29:17,257 --> 00:29:18,597
I'm looking for a classroom.

639
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,720
I'm trying to find a place
for my classes.

640
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,400
You are running a class?

641
00:29:22,483 --> 00:29:24,266
What a coincidence.
I got a place for you.

642
00:29:24,537 --> 00:29:26,936
I's applying for a TCM industrial park.

643
00:29:27,416 --> 00:29:28,895
It's subsidized by the government.

644
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:30,990
How about this?
I'll give you a building.

645
00:29:31,176 --> 00:29:33,017
And you can run your class there.

646
00:29:34,137 --> 00:29:36,017
Don't mess with me.

647
00:29:37,257 --> 00:29:38,414
I'm not messing with you.

648
00:29:38,497 --> 00:29:41,257
I support the cause of TCM
with all my heart.

649
00:29:41,857 --> 00:29:44,617
Besides, you've helped me
so much over the years.

650
00:29:44,857 --> 00:29:46,137
Now that you need something,

651
00:29:46,497 --> 00:29:47,777
I'm all for it.

652
00:29:48,257 --> 00:29:49,257
Right?

653
00:29:50,416 --> 00:29:52,497
I don't have the money to pay rent.

654
00:29:53,109 --> 00:29:54,109
Forget about the rent.

655
00:29:54,995 --> 00:29:56,973
With you, the great Buddha,
presiding here,

656
00:29:57,056 --> 00:29:58,317
all the surrounding immortals

657
00:29:58,970 --> 00:29:59,970
will flock to it.

658
00:30:01,829 --> 00:30:02,829
I mean it.

659
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,971
So, about the classroom...

660
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:06,056
It's settled.

661
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,953
(Liu Chang Qing)

662
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,359
Have you lost your mind, Sun Tou Tou?

663
00:30:21,137 --> 00:30:22,137
What is this?

664
00:30:22,257 --> 00:30:23,197
I'm celebrating

665
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,063
my achievement of securing
a new job with a salary of 4,800 yuan.

666
00:30:27,257 --> 00:30:28,257
You?

667
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:34,100
The successor of TCM.

668
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:37,017
4,800 yuan per month.

669
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,729
Which of it aligns with your persona?

670
00:30:42,703 --> 00:30:43,703
Does it matter?

671
00:30:45,322 --> 00:30:46,615
Do you know what matters?

672
00:30:46,698 --> 00:30:47,698
What?

673
00:30:48,448 --> 00:30:49,753
There is a handsome guy there.

674
00:30:49,857 --> 00:30:51,737
He's tall, thin and fair-skinned.

675
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,050
And he's difficult.

676
00:30:55,137 --> 00:30:56,572
Seriously? Do you have his photo?

677
00:30:57,617 --> 00:30:59,237
Where am I going to get you his photo?

678
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,857
I couldn't just take his photos
like a stalker.

679
00:31:02,377 --> 00:31:03,377
Right.

680
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:05,259
What do you mean by he's difficult?

681
00:31:07,537 --> 00:31:09,497
How should I describe it?
Difficult is...

682
00:31:10,257 --> 00:31:11,174
My back is injured.

683
00:31:11,257 --> 00:31:12,257
I can't bow.

684
00:31:13,777 --> 00:31:14,777
He's aloof and distant.

685
00:31:15,617 --> 00:31:16,897
He makes you feel like

686
00:31:17,777 --> 00:31:18,574
you can't get him.

687
00:31:18,657 --> 00:31:20,183
And it feels particularly exciting.

688
00:31:20,296 --> 00:31:22,537
It feels challenging!

689
00:31:23,497 --> 00:31:25,255
All right. You have my permission to go.

690
00:31:25,338 --> 00:31:26,858
You should

691
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,387
stabilize your position first.
Then, bring him back to me.

692
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,123
I will bring my boyfriend back to you.

693
00:31:32,777 --> 00:31:34,777
I thought you were going
to set me up with him.

694
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,960
Turns out that you are
saving him for yourself.

695
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,373
Isn't what's yours also mine?

696
00:31:39,456 --> 00:31:40,827
Why bother making such clear divisions?

697
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:42,389
No. He's mine.

698
00:31:42,737 --> 00:31:43,737
He's yours.

699
00:32:03,897 --> 00:32:05,137
Stop walking around here.

700
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,920
Leave it.

701
00:32:16,857 --> 00:32:17,936
You are no longer young.

702
00:32:18,737 --> 00:32:20,375
You just quit your job
without hesitation.

703
00:32:20,458 --> 00:32:22,537
You didn't even discuss
with me or ask me.

704
00:32:24,377 --> 00:32:25,377
Of course.

705
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,160
If you had asked me,

706
00:32:27,377 --> 00:32:28,657
I would have agreed to it.

707
00:32:31,102 --> 00:32:32,102
Professor Ren,

708
00:32:33,043 --> 00:32:34,475
can you do me a favour?

709
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,840
I'm not against you doing charity work.

710
00:32:38,216 --> 00:32:40,537
Can't you contribute a little
to your own family too?

711
00:32:41,137 --> 00:32:43,496
Family is also part
of the community, right?

712
00:32:43,617 --> 00:32:44,857
I've made up my mind.

713
00:32:45,137 --> 00:32:47,056
I have to run this apprentice class.

714
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,840
Fine, fine.

715
00:32:49,537 --> 00:32:50,777
You are

716
00:32:51,617 --> 00:32:52,704
well respected by people.

717
00:32:53,043 --> 00:32:55,043
You even got yourself a free classroom.

718
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,065
Let me put this up front,
don't expect me to help you.

719
00:33:00,802 --> 00:33:01,876
You heard what we said.

720
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,800
I don't need your help.

721
00:33:04,853 --> 00:33:05,853
I need you

722
00:33:06,897 --> 00:33:07,984
to contribute some money.

723
00:33:11,977 --> 00:33:12,977
What money?

724
00:33:13,416 --> 00:33:14,934
Our family cannot afford

725
00:33:15,017 --> 00:33:17,777
to have all of our students live with us,

726
00:33:18,176 --> 00:33:19,216
but I hope that

727
00:33:19,617 --> 00:33:21,737
those who are able
to attend the apprentice class

728
00:33:21,977 --> 00:33:24,456
can concentrate on their studies
without any distractions.

729
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,106
I want to provide them
with food and accommodation,

730
00:33:27,189 --> 00:33:28,189
at least

731
00:33:28,683 --> 00:33:30,537
during the initial period of my class,

732
00:33:30,936 --> 00:33:33,137
so that everyone can
gather together to learn.

733
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:42,570
Professor Ren,

734
00:33:44,775 --> 00:33:45,816
do you think

735
00:33:46,176 --> 00:33:47,696
we have a gold mine

736
00:33:47,936 --> 00:33:49,216
buried under this house?

737
00:33:51,823 --> 00:33:52,823
Listen to me,

738
00:33:53,176 --> 00:33:55,698
the only thing we have in our house
is a big hole like you.

739
00:33:59,696 --> 00:34:01,657
It was Shan Dao's idea to set up

740
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,574
this apprentice course
in the first place.

741
00:34:04,657 --> 00:34:05,918
I thought it was a good idea.

742
00:34:06,216 --> 00:34:07,296
I supported him.

743
00:34:07,556 --> 00:34:11,376
Who knew that he just went quiet
after saying that it was very difficult?

744
00:34:12,416 --> 00:34:13,373
He gave up.

745
00:34:13,456 --> 00:34:14,817
I think this is a good thing.

746
00:34:15,176 --> 00:34:16,176
I'll be gaining merits.

747
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,520
I was thinking that

748
00:34:18,176 --> 00:34:19,696
maybe God is giving me a chance

749
00:34:20,136 --> 00:34:22,816
to contribute to TCM.

750
00:34:23,656 --> 00:34:24,737
So, I was thinking that

751
00:34:25,456 --> 00:34:26,456
I have to

752
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,211
run this apprentice class.

753
00:34:29,636 --> 00:34:31,800
Even people thought it was hard,

754
00:34:31,896 --> 00:34:33,856
why don't you find it difficult?

755
00:34:36,522 --> 00:34:38,403
Because his wife isn't you.

756
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,373
So, no matter what I do,

757
00:34:42,456 --> 00:34:45,017
even if it's difficult,
I don't find it hard.

758
00:34:47,456 --> 00:34:48,456
But you see,

759
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:51,804
it hasn't been long since the state
recognised apprenticeship training.

760
00:34:52,775 --> 00:34:54,215
You have to figure out

761
00:34:55,017 --> 00:34:56,896
the procedures step by step

762
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,720
to run this class.

763
00:35:00,775 --> 00:35:01,775
What are

764
00:35:02,376 --> 00:35:03,497
you going to do?

765
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,573
Someone has
to take the first step, right?

766
00:35:07,656 --> 00:35:10,017
It's not like there's a red carpet
waiting for you.

767
00:35:10,742 --> 00:35:11,614
If it were that easy,

768
00:35:11,697 --> 00:35:13,817
everyone would do it.

769
00:35:14,416 --> 00:35:15,416
As you know,

770
00:35:16,376 --> 00:35:18,414
throughout my life,
I have searched far and wide

771
00:35:18,497 --> 00:35:20,537
for renowned doctors in rural areas.

772
00:35:21,176 --> 00:35:21,975
Most of them

773
00:35:22,058 --> 00:35:24,216
don't hold the title of professor,

774
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:27,976
but every master I've apprenticed under

775
00:35:28,737 --> 00:35:30,216
is a person

776
00:35:30,656 --> 00:35:34,216
who follows the principles of TCM.

777
00:35:34,416 --> 00:35:36,894
I have spent half of my life
verifying their knowledge

778
00:35:36,977 --> 00:35:38,097
and expertise.

779
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,486
They are individuals

780
00:35:40,936 --> 00:35:42,192
of great virtue and talent.

781
00:35:42,275 --> 00:35:44,076
So, I want

782
00:35:44,376 --> 00:35:46,257
to invite them all

783
00:35:47,216 --> 00:35:48,216
to teach the students.

784
00:35:48,656 --> 00:35:49,656
Let's first build up

785
00:35:49,816 --> 00:35:51,416
a reserve force

786
00:35:51,515 --> 00:35:53,315
and explore step by step.

787
00:35:53,416 --> 00:35:54,456
As we move forward,

788
00:35:54,977 --> 00:35:55,977
the path ahead

789
00:35:57,696 --> 00:35:58,696
will become clearer.

790
00:36:01,297 --> 00:36:02,297
So,

791
00:36:02,815 --> 00:36:04,894
Master Yushan is still around?

792
00:36:04,977 --> 00:36:05,977
Yes.

793
00:36:06,216 --> 00:36:08,216
Would TCM Master,

794
00:36:09,176 --> 00:36:10,777
Qiu Jian Xian, be willing to come?

795
00:36:12,257 --> 00:36:14,416
As long as I personally invite them,

796
00:36:14,737 --> 00:36:15,936
they will definitely come.

797
00:36:20,376 --> 00:36:22,176
In that case,

798
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,400
that's not bad.

799
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,502
If they are willing to come,

800
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,320
then this class will do

801
00:36:31,603 --> 00:36:34,083
a lot of good for Tian Zhen,

802
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,216
when he's pursing his doctoral studies.

803
00:36:38,737 --> 00:36:39,694
That's good.

804
00:36:39,777 --> 00:36:42,176
Don't you know your son?

805
00:36:42,856 --> 00:36:43,856
He is

806
00:36:44,209 --> 00:36:46,009
rebellious.

807
00:36:46,376 --> 00:36:47,696
He won't do

808
00:36:47,936 --> 00:36:48,936
what's good for him.

809
00:36:51,896 --> 00:36:53,136
It's my son.

810
00:36:53,656 --> 00:36:54,936
What are you so angry about?

811
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,800
You pacified her?

812
00:37:22,057 --> 00:37:24,376
Your daughter is reasonable.

813
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,193
She doesn't need me to pacify her.

814
00:37:29,029 --> 00:37:30,815
That's right.
I don't need to be pacified.

815
00:37:31,497 --> 00:37:32,856
I just carry out the order

816
00:37:33,269 --> 00:37:34,269
and obey.

817
00:37:35,936 --> 00:37:38,297
Now that you've thought
of the worst possible outcome,

818
00:37:38,616 --> 00:37:39,656
just go for it.

819
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:40,870
Yes, Mum.

820
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,557
Working for the inheritance of TCM

821
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,988
will only yield positive results,
not negative results.

822
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:47,962
Are all the syllabuses arranged?

823
00:37:48,136 --> 00:37:49,658
I will figure it out as I go along.

824
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,747
I will arrange it
as they attend the classes.

825
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:52,909
What about the fund?

826
00:37:53,136 --> 00:37:55,176
Don't worry about that, Master.

827
00:37:55,656 --> 00:37:56,656
Your apprentice

828
00:37:57,017 --> 00:37:58,136
just waved his arm

829
00:37:58,696 --> 00:37:59,696
and the money came in.

830
00:38:02,883 --> 00:38:04,004
He waved his arm,

831
00:38:04,376 --> 00:38:05,376
and I paid the money.

832
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,200
I still have some savings.

833
00:38:08,383 --> 00:38:10,063
I can contribute all of them.

834
00:38:11,176 --> 00:38:12,176
All?

835
00:38:12,896 --> 00:38:14,613
What about our grandson's marriage?

836
00:38:14,696 --> 00:38:16,456
That depends on his ability.

837
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,214
If my grandson is capable,

838
00:38:18,297 --> 00:38:20,817
he won't have
to worry about getting a wife.

839
00:38:21,656 --> 00:38:24,880
If he wants to grow his skills,
this is a good chance for him.

840
00:38:25,416 --> 00:38:27,416
Let him attend the class.

841
00:38:29,097 --> 00:38:31,416
Dad, he's your grandson.

842
00:38:31,656 --> 00:38:32,856
You should talk to him.

843
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,216
You have to convince him.

844
00:38:34,616 --> 00:38:35,856
He won't listen to us.

845
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:38,799
Convince me to do what?

846
00:38:41,176 --> 00:38:42,916
You want to test acu points on me again?

847
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,454
Or you want me to take medicine?

848
00:38:44,537 --> 00:38:46,255
No, no. No medicine.

849
00:38:46,338 --> 00:38:48,297
We want you to have dinner.
Come on.

850
00:38:48,737 --> 00:38:50,257
We want you to study.

851
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,280
Study?

852
00:38:55,382 --> 00:38:56,941
Here's the thing.

853
00:38:57,216 --> 00:38:58,737
Your dear father

854
00:38:59,456 --> 00:39:00,537
has resigned.

855
00:39:02,083 --> 00:39:03,033
And then,

856
00:39:03,116 --> 00:39:04,156
he wants to

857
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:05,654
run a TCM apprentice class.

858
00:39:05,737 --> 00:39:06,775
Your grandpa

859
00:39:06,858 --> 00:39:08,737
wants you to join the class.

860
00:39:08,856 --> 00:39:09,856
After all,

861
00:39:10,216 --> 00:39:11,357
the class will invite

862
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,320
many prominent TCM experts

863
00:39:14,416 --> 00:39:15,416
to give lectures,

864
00:39:16,176 --> 00:39:18,456
as well as some renowned
rural practitioners.

865
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,699
They will not

866
00:39:19,782 --> 00:39:21,775
only teach theoretical knowledge

867
00:39:21,858 --> 00:39:22,858
but also offer courses

868
00:39:23,175 --> 00:39:25,373
on herbal planting,

869
00:39:25,456 --> 00:39:28,777
medicinal herb collection,
and processing techniques.

870
00:39:30,176 --> 00:39:31,936
It's a good learning opportunity.

871
00:39:33,022 --> 00:39:34,022
However,

872
00:39:34,737 --> 00:39:36,977
your dad won't let you join.

873
00:39:38,282 --> 00:39:39,442
Why won't he let me join?

874
00:39:40,096 --> 00:39:41,357
Your level is not sufficient.

875
00:39:43,216 --> 00:39:44,257
Is Sun Tou Tou going?

876
00:39:44,376 --> 00:39:45,376
Of course.

877
00:39:45,576 --> 00:39:47,096
Even a delivery girl can join,

878
00:39:47,216 --> 00:39:48,999
so why am I not qualified for your class?

879
00:39:49,456 --> 00:39:50,456
I don't agree

880
00:39:50,656 --> 00:39:51,977
with you going either.

881
00:39:52,176 --> 00:39:53,537
Think about it, you have to

882
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,986
climb steep cliffs and precipices
to gather herbs.

883
00:39:56,069 --> 00:39:57,829
You are my only grandson.

884
00:39:58,656 --> 00:40:00,176
I don't dare to risk it.

885
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,320
I don't agree either.

886
00:40:01,416 --> 00:40:02,416
Actually,

887
00:40:02,977 --> 00:40:03,934
that class

888
00:40:04,017 --> 00:40:05,335
is truly arduous.

889
00:40:05,418 --> 00:40:08,136
Unlike at home, where you
are well clothed and well fed.

890
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,654
There is also no guarantee of success.

891
00:40:09,737 --> 00:40:11,057
You should

892
00:40:11,497 --> 00:40:12,974
just finish your studies

893
00:40:13,057 --> 00:40:14,053
and get a job

894
00:40:14,136 --> 00:40:15,775
in a proper hospital.

895
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,200
That's better, right?

896
00:40:17,737 --> 00:40:19,999
Mum, while we are on this subject,

897
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:22,376
I'd like to share about my thoughts.

898
00:40:23,497 --> 00:40:26,060
I hope that in the future,
I will be dealing with living people

899
00:40:26,143 --> 00:40:29,257
rather than patients labelled
with various medical conditions.

900
00:40:29,777 --> 00:40:31,456
I said goodbye to Grandma Lu today.

901
00:40:32,136 --> 00:40:34,136
She may be gone soon.

902
00:40:34,456 --> 00:40:36,977
She didn't want me
to touch her with my gloved hands.

903
00:40:38,255 --> 00:40:40,096
She wanted to hold my warm hands.

904
00:40:41,136 --> 00:40:42,745
Everyone was so busy in the hospital.

905
00:40:42,977 --> 00:40:44,737
No one had time to give her a hug.

906
00:40:45,556 --> 00:40:47,687
I used to focus on
only illnesses at the hospital,

907
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:49,796
not the people who were sick.

908
00:40:50,297 --> 00:40:51,856
All illnesses.

909
00:40:53,156 --> 00:40:54,676
I don't want to go on like this.

910
00:40:57,563 --> 00:40:59,363
Since he's so determined,

911
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,361
you shouldn't stand in the way.

912
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,773
Let him join the apprentice class.

913
00:41:02,856 --> 00:41:03,977
It's settled then.

914
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,093
It's settled.

915
00:41:05,176 --> 00:41:06,216
I agree then.

916
00:41:07,537 --> 00:41:08,533
Let's eat.

917
00:41:08,616 --> 00:41:09,616
Let's eat.

918
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,360
Hang on.

919
00:41:19,696 --> 00:41:22,136
How come I sense the familiar feeling
of being set up?

920
00:41:25,857 --> 00:41:27,417
Have I been tricked again?

921
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,760
Mum,

922
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:30,150
I think you added

923
00:41:30,656 --> 00:41:32,017
too much wine into this dish.

924
00:41:32,216 --> 00:41:33,216
I didn't.

925
00:41:33,376 --> 00:41:34,333
Really. Try it.

926
00:41:34,416 --> 00:41:35,416
