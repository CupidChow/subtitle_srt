1
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,920
(Gen Z)

2
00:01:35,639 --> 00:01:37,720
(Episode 39)

3
00:01:42,696 --> 00:01:44,600
This is a prescription
specifically for the epidemic.

4
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:45,751
I asked my dad about it.

5
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,720
He said we could roast brown rice
until it turns golden brown

6
00:01:47,746 --> 00:01:48,440
and make porridge with them.

7
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,479
It invigorates the spleen
and dispels dampness.

8
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,757
It's helpful against this illness.

9
00:01:50,878 --> 00:01:52,358
I'll organise it into an article

10
00:01:52,438 --> 00:01:54,504
and publish it on
the public account right away.

11
00:02:07,198 --> 00:02:08,198
I'm not

12
00:02:09,318 --> 00:02:10,557
having coronavirus, am I?

13
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,459
What you have is
more serious than coronavirus.

14
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:22,470
Drink your medicine.

15
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,280
Thank you, my wife.

16
00:02:33,597 --> 00:02:35,078
Easy, easy.

17
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:38,557
Okay.

18
00:02:48,478 --> 00:02:50,517
Are all the other matters
arranged properly?

19
00:02:53,225 --> 00:02:55,119
We've accepted and treated
as many patients as possible.

20
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,080
It's all arranged,

21
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,200
so things are not as tense on our end.

22
00:02:58,884 --> 00:02:59,684
However,

23
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:01,343
most patients

24
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:03,131
don't understand our approach.

25
00:03:03,837 --> 00:03:04,637
After all,

26
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,801
families have to be

27
00:03:06,091 --> 00:03:07,171
quarantined separately.

28
00:03:08,551 --> 00:03:10,204
They would be worried about each other.

29
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:12,277
In special times,

30
00:03:13,158 --> 00:03:14,197
we need special measures.

31
00:03:18,009 --> 00:03:19,369
Isn't our family

32
00:03:20,276 --> 00:03:21,356
doing the same?

33
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,320
Ouch, ouch.

34
00:03:28,864 --> 00:03:29,744
Ouch, ouch

35
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:32,130
Don't move.

36
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,040
If this abscess doesn't heal,

37
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,360
you will suffer in your later years,
you know?

38
00:03:36,433 --> 00:03:37,233
It's fine.

39
00:03:38,038 --> 00:03:39,038
In my later years,

40
00:03:39,643 --> 00:03:40,949
I have you to take care of me.

41
00:03:42,621 --> 00:03:44,473
Where do you get the confidence
to say that?

42
00:03:45,844 --> 00:03:46,644
I know.

43
00:03:48,798 --> 00:03:49,757
You can't bear...

44
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:51,998
You can't bear to leave me behind.

45
00:03:56,878 --> 00:03:57,678
Get some rest.

46
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,043
I need to write down
the medical record today

47
00:04:00,124 --> 00:04:01,157
and send it to my dad.

48
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:12,518
Are you still mad at me?

49
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:14,438
Mad?

50
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:16,677
Why would I be mad?

51
00:04:20,037 --> 00:04:21,238
Saying you are not mad

52
00:04:22,518 --> 00:04:23,677
means you are mad.

53
00:04:27,878 --> 00:04:28,957
It's not worth

54
00:04:29,037 --> 00:04:30,037
punishing myself

55
00:04:30,397 --> 00:04:31,556
for someone else's mistake.

56
00:04:31,757 --> 00:04:33,117
If you really are not mad,

57
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:35,158
come.

58
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:38,037
Sit beside me.

59
00:04:39,117 --> 00:04:39,917
Professor Ren,

60
00:04:40,277 --> 00:04:41,290
please behave yourself.

61
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,396
Saying you're not angry

62
00:05:16,037 --> 00:05:17,197
means you're angry.

63
00:05:18,197 --> 00:05:19,197
Saying you don't hate me

64
00:05:20,358 --> 00:05:21,371
means you truly hate me.

65
00:05:24,197 --> 00:05:25,277
I know

66
00:05:26,277 --> 00:05:27,557
you care about me

67
00:05:28,917 --> 00:05:29,717
the most.

68
00:05:30,837 --> 00:05:31,637
Otherwise,

69
00:05:32,277 --> 00:05:33,077
you wouldn't have

70
00:05:33,557 --> 00:05:35,197
left behind four elderly people,

71
00:05:35,837 --> 00:05:36,917
our son,

72
00:05:38,277 --> 00:05:39,477
and risked your own life

73
00:05:40,917 --> 00:05:41,837
to come to me.

74
00:05:44,037 --> 00:05:45,037
You are overthinking it.

75
00:05:45,837 --> 00:05:46,917
I am a doctor too.

76
00:05:47,637 --> 00:05:50,416
Both professionally and personally,
it's only right for me to be here.

77
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:52,317
You just

78
00:05:54,237 --> 00:05:55,237
can't bear

79
00:05:56,318 --> 00:05:57,557
to see me die early, can you?

80
00:06:03,677 --> 00:06:04,717
I admire your

81
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,521
selfless dedication to TCM

82
00:06:07,237 --> 00:06:09,478
and your selfless care for patients.

83
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,733
It has nothing to do
with personal feelings.

84
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:39,077
Looks like

85
00:06:40,198 --> 00:06:41,797
you really don't love me anymore.

86
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,677
You already have a love child.

87
00:06:46,443 --> 00:06:47,644
Do you still love me then?

88
00:06:53,357 --> 00:06:54,797
Did you see Mr Xie?

89
00:06:55,677 --> 00:06:56,477
Yes.

90
00:06:57,957 --> 00:06:59,357
Did you see his wife?

91
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,983
Did she enter the mobile cabin hospital?

92
00:07:03,198 --> 00:07:03,998
No.

93
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,986
She has been taken to ICU.

94
00:07:07,397 --> 00:07:08,197
I don't think

95
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:10,478
she will come back.

96
00:07:11,198 --> 00:07:12,824
They put her on extracorporeal
membrane oxygenation (ECMO).

97
00:07:48,237 --> 00:07:49,037
His spouse,

98
00:07:49,957 --> 00:07:52,237
I remember

99
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:53,598
she once said this

100
00:07:54,077 --> 00:07:54,957
to me.

101
00:07:56,638 --> 00:07:57,438
She said...

102
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:02,038
What a beautiful sunrise.

103
00:08:06,077 --> 00:08:07,397
I wonder

104
00:08:08,397 --> 00:08:09,718
if this glimpse

105
00:08:10,718 --> 00:08:13,438
would be my last one.

106
00:08:22,077 --> 00:08:22,998
Who knows...

107
00:08:23,677 --> 00:08:25,198
Who knows

108
00:08:27,638 --> 00:08:29,918
if this glimpse

109
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:33,237
would be my last one?

110
00:08:37,077 --> 00:08:39,478
As long as we love each other,

111
00:08:41,117 --> 00:08:42,237
we should...

112
00:08:43,517 --> 00:08:46,517
We should treat each other kindly.

113
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,200
Zhao Li Quan,

114
00:10:21,438 --> 00:10:22,318
guess where I am.

115
00:10:25,998 --> 00:10:27,037
Where are you?

116
00:10:27,717 --> 00:10:29,597
(I'm in Tong'an Hospital in Wuhan.)

117
00:10:29,677 --> 00:10:31,903
(West 2nd General Ward.
Nurse Tian Xing Xing of Class A.)

118
00:10:34,477 --> 00:10:35,398
You are here in Wuhan?

119
00:10:36,657 --> 00:10:38,537
It's my duty
to treat and save patients too.

120
00:10:38,983 --> 00:10:41,583
Don't you know how dangerous
the situation is in Wuhan right now?

121
00:10:42,318 --> 00:10:44,597
If you can come,
why can't I, right?

122
00:10:45,656 --> 00:10:46,456
(Besides,)

123
00:10:47,823 --> 00:10:48,623
(I mean,)

124
00:10:49,878 --> 00:10:51,037
I feel closer to you here.

125
00:10:54,477 --> 00:10:55,277
(By the way,)

126
00:10:55,797 --> 00:10:56,797
(you left in a hurry)

127
00:10:57,037 --> 00:10:58,077
last time.

128
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,403
There was something
I didn't get a chance to tell you.

129
00:11:02,438 --> 00:11:03,238
What is it?

130
00:11:07,477 --> 00:11:09,318
Take care of yourself over there.

131
00:11:10,037 --> 00:11:10,837
(We will)

132
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,481
(go back together.)

133
00:11:14,797 --> 00:11:15,597
You too.

134
00:11:16,477 --> 00:11:17,278
Stay protected.

135
00:11:18,117 --> 00:11:18,917
I'll take you home.

136
00:12:09,797 --> 00:12:11,677
(As the bright moon
shines over the sea,)

137
00:12:12,557 --> 00:12:14,449
(from far away
you share this moment with me.)

138
00:12:15,518 --> 00:12:17,398
(Lovers lament the distant night,)

139
00:12:18,518 --> 00:12:20,398
(spending sleepless nights
consumed by longing.)

140
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,240
(Tian Zhen,)

141
00:12:26,917 --> 00:12:28,438
(you taught me this poem.)

142
00:12:30,037 --> 00:12:30,837
(You said)

143
00:12:32,117 --> 00:12:34,717
(it's the most beautiful one
among the poems)

144
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,060
(you learned about yearning.)

145
00:12:47,917 --> 00:12:49,557
(You even gave me
a challenge at the time,)

146
00:12:50,363 --> 00:12:52,324
(mentioning a famous Japanese writer)

147
00:12:54,117 --> 00:12:55,717
(who used the moon to express love.)

148
00:12:59,797 --> 00:13:02,037
(I asked you many times,
but you refused to tell me)

149
00:13:02,998 --> 00:13:04,117
(the exact line.)

150
00:13:10,878 --> 00:13:11,917
(Now I know.)

151
00:13:14,917 --> 00:13:16,530
(The moon tonight is truly beautiful.)

152
00:13:49,917 --> 00:13:50,917
Have you eaten today?

153
00:13:52,237 --> 00:13:53,318
Do you like the food?

154
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:55,037
The food is good,

155
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:58,157
but I have no appetite.

156
00:14:05,237 --> 00:14:06,797
Let me see your tongue.

157
00:14:09,677 --> 00:14:10,856
Do you have a bitter taste
in your mouth?

158
00:14:13,117 --> 00:14:14,037
I am fine.

159
00:14:16,477 --> 00:14:18,037
I just feel guilty.

160
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:21,031
Guilty about what?

161
00:14:23,597 --> 00:14:24,717
Seeing all of you

162
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:26,277
working so hard on the front line,

163
00:14:26,357 --> 00:14:28,357
while I'm being useless,

164
00:14:29,597 --> 00:14:30,717
unable to do anything.

165
00:14:31,357 --> 00:14:32,757
That's enough. Stop saying those things.

166
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,076
It makes you breathless when you speak.

167
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,396
I'll add an additional herbal medicine
for you today.

168
00:14:36,477 --> 00:14:38,403
Looks like your vital energy
is still weak.

169
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:42,116
I'm consuming resources

170
00:14:43,323 --> 00:14:45,229
without contributing anything
to the country.

171
00:14:45,796 --> 00:14:46,876
I feel guilty.

172
00:14:48,717 --> 00:14:50,477
Stop feeling guilty.

173
00:14:50,677 --> 00:14:52,797
It's not beneficial to your recovery.

174
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,720
By the way,

175
00:14:55,917 --> 00:14:56,957
Tian Zhen said

176
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,836
you haven't contacted Tou Tou
for a long time.

177
00:14:58,917 --> 00:15:01,157
She has been asking about
Wu Shan Dao's treatment plan.

178
00:15:03,917 --> 00:15:05,438
I didn't contact her on purpose.

179
00:15:06,878 --> 00:15:08,397
You still haven't told her

180
00:15:08,477 --> 00:15:09,357
you are sick?

181
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,400
No.

182
00:15:11,998 --> 00:15:13,797
Don't you know her?

183
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:15,990
If she knew I was sick,

184
00:15:16,677 --> 00:15:18,677
she would have left Shan Dao
and come to Wuhan.

185
00:15:23,983 --> 00:15:25,423
You don't care about your son,

186
00:15:25,643 --> 00:15:26,884
your wife,

187
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,681
your parents.

188
00:15:29,597 --> 00:15:30,677
All you care about

189
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:31,863
is this girl.

190
00:15:32,603 --> 00:15:34,283
She truly is your own daughter.

191
00:15:35,003 --> 00:15:36,629
She is more important
than the whole family.

192
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:51,357
What's wrong?

193
00:15:52,357 --> 00:15:53,357
Happy Women's Day.

194
00:15:55,876 --> 00:15:57,196
You are so silly.

195
00:15:59,797 --> 00:16:00,717
Looks like

196
00:16:00,896 --> 00:16:02,202
you are getting a lot better.

197
00:16:03,117 --> 00:16:04,878
You've never given me flowers before.

198
00:16:05,318 --> 00:16:06,363
Where did this come from?

199
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,357
The patient I treated before

200
00:16:10,117 --> 00:16:11,037
has recovered.

201
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,476
He is

202
00:16:12,998 --> 00:16:14,557
now a full-time volunteer.

203
00:16:15,037 --> 00:16:16,557
He came to visit me

204
00:16:17,237 --> 00:16:18,656
and asked me if I needed anything.

205
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:19,961
I asked

206
00:16:20,677 --> 00:16:21,878
if there were any roses.

207
00:16:22,557 --> 00:16:23,998
And he brought me this single rose.

208
00:16:32,717 --> 00:16:33,677
I will

209
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,560
put it here.

210
00:16:36,717 --> 00:16:38,677
It gives the room a sense of vitality.

211
00:16:39,542 --> 00:16:40,595
It's beautiful, isn't it?

212
00:16:41,717 --> 00:16:43,078
If you think it's beautiful,

213
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:45,357
then don't leave.

214
00:16:46,357 --> 00:16:47,677
Let's enjoy the flower together.

215
00:17:05,477 --> 00:17:06,717
If you think

216
00:17:07,797 --> 00:17:09,477
you can win me over

217
00:17:10,357 --> 00:17:12,117
with just a rose,

218
00:17:13,797 --> 00:17:14,837
you should reflect on

219
00:17:14,917 --> 00:17:15,837
your mistakes.

220
00:17:15,917 --> 00:17:16,717
Let me tell you,

221
00:17:17,223 --> 00:17:18,624
I won't forgive you.

222
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,081
Tou Tou isn't my daughter.

223
00:17:32,878 --> 00:17:33,998
I'm talking to you.

224
00:17:34,998 --> 00:17:36,638
Tou Tou isn't my daughter.

225
00:17:42,117 --> 00:17:43,078
Forget it.

226
00:17:46,438 --> 00:17:47,717
Don't stop there.

227
00:17:48,438 --> 00:17:49,878
Finish what you want to say.

228
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,429
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

229
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,081
Say that again.

230
00:18:02,237 --> 00:18:03,800
Who don't you want to talk to anymore?

231
00:18:06,477 --> 00:18:07,277
I don't want to...

232
00:18:08,917 --> 00:18:09,916
Talk to myself anymore.

233
00:18:12,998 --> 00:18:13,917
That's more like it.

234
00:18:15,557 --> 00:18:16,998
Actually,

235
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,083
I've been thinking,

236
00:18:19,797 --> 00:18:22,237
we've been married for so many years.

237
00:18:22,876 --> 00:18:24,557
Why do you keep holding onto

238
00:18:25,117 --> 00:18:26,797
a trivial matter like this

239
00:18:27,117 --> 00:18:28,917
and can't let it go?

240
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,640
Where is the basic trust

241
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,037
between us?

242
00:18:37,557 --> 00:18:38,958
Are you seriously blaming me?

243
00:18:40,129 --> 00:18:41,570
If you truly trusted me,

244
00:18:42,237 --> 00:18:44,490
would you have tested me
with something like this?

245
00:18:44,638 --> 00:18:45,477
Come on.

246
00:18:47,437 --> 00:18:48,237
Let's

247
00:18:49,077 --> 00:18:50,317
make things clear today.

248
00:18:51,717 --> 00:18:52,957
Whose daughter is Tou Tou?

249
00:18:58,717 --> 00:18:59,837
Could she be

250
00:19:00,717 --> 00:19:01,837
Wu Shan Dao's daughter?

251
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:04,251
Shan Dao didn't tell me.

252
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:06,317
He just told me that

253
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,116
the girl he brought back
is an offspring of

254
00:19:08,197 --> 00:19:10,558
the Jiang family's acupuncture
technique successor.

255
00:19:12,283 --> 00:19:15,278
But didn't Zhao Li Quan present evidence
to prove she isn't?

256
00:19:15,957 --> 00:19:17,296
I don't know how that happened.

257
00:19:17,837 --> 00:19:19,643
Just like you,
I really haven't got a clue.

258
00:19:20,077 --> 00:19:21,597
Why don't you go and ask Shan Dao

259
00:19:22,317 --> 00:19:23,998
when you go back?

260
00:19:24,837 --> 00:19:26,197
What can I ask him?

261
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,920
He said he doesn't remember anything.

262
00:19:29,477 --> 00:19:30,277
Well,

263
00:19:31,717 --> 00:19:33,717
even if he doesn't remember anything,

264
00:19:34,317 --> 00:19:36,157
with today's scientific advancements,

265
00:19:36,237 --> 00:19:37,037
a simple

266
00:19:38,357 --> 00:19:40,237
DNA test will give us the answer.

267
00:19:46,816 --> 00:19:48,416
Tou Tou isn't your daughter.

268
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,638
Why did you say she was then?

269
00:19:51,597 --> 00:19:52,957
For the sake of Tou Tou,

270
00:19:53,678 --> 00:19:56,597
for the trust she just established.

271
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,160
Given her temperament,

272
00:20:01,717 --> 00:20:03,996
we firmly believed before
that she was the successor of

273
00:20:04,317 --> 00:20:06,197
the Jiang family's acupuncture sect.

274
00:20:06,678 --> 00:20:09,197
If Zhao Li Quan demolished that belief,

275
00:20:09,717 --> 00:20:10,877
then all our hard work

276
00:20:10,957 --> 00:20:13,558
and efforts to change Tou Tou
would have gone to waste,

277
00:20:13,717 --> 00:20:14,837
wouldn't it?

278
00:20:15,717 --> 00:20:17,437
You're afraid of ruining your disciple,

279
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,320
but you're not afraid
of breaking my heart

280
00:20:20,717 --> 00:20:21,837
and ruining my trust?

281
00:20:22,837 --> 00:20:24,197
I always thought that

282
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:26,237
as a married couple,

283
00:20:27,038 --> 00:20:28,437
we could read each other's mind

284
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,356
just by looking into each other's eyes.

285
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:31,437
I didn't expect that

286
00:20:31,676 --> 00:20:33,877
you would crumble faster than Tou Tou.

287
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,160
After all these years of cultivation,

288
00:20:37,717 --> 00:20:39,303
your true colours have been revealed.

289
00:20:42,437 --> 00:20:43,477
Yet, you have the audacity

290
00:20:43,957 --> 00:20:45,197
to sulk,

291
00:20:45,678 --> 00:20:46,957
give me the silent treatment,

292
00:20:47,597 --> 00:20:48,678
and take your blanket

293
00:20:49,077 --> 00:20:51,237
and move to the massage room upstairs.

294
00:20:51,437 --> 00:20:54,397
That's what I call failing the test.

295
00:20:54,477 --> 00:20:56,237
You... You are the one who failed.

296
00:20:56,317 --> 00:20:57,117
Fine.

297
00:20:57,357 --> 00:20:58,197
I failed.

298
00:21:02,317 --> 00:21:04,597
Who says I crumbled faster

299
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:05,957
than Tou Tou?

300
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:08,358
Actually...

301
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,279
Actually, I never doubted you at all.

302
00:21:13,957 --> 00:21:15,998
I knew Tou Tou isn't your daughter.

303
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:17,870
I was just upset that

304
00:21:18,357 --> 00:21:19,877
you put me in an embarrassing position

305
00:21:19,957 --> 00:21:21,197
in front of so many people.

306
00:21:21,717 --> 00:21:22,837
You didn't respect me.

307
00:21:26,837 --> 00:21:27,798
All right, all right.

308
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,288
(Jiangzhou People's Hospital)

309
00:21:51,197 --> 00:21:51,997
What's the matter?

310
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:53,878
Missing your master?

311
00:22:03,558 --> 00:22:04,358
I miss them.

312
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:06,870
Them?

313
00:22:09,437 --> 00:22:11,143
So, there is someone else
that you miss.

314
00:22:13,117 --> 00:22:13,917
Look at you,

315
00:22:14,437 --> 00:22:15,630
you insisted on hiding here

316
00:22:16,383 --> 00:22:17,584
when you could have gone home.

317
00:22:18,357 --> 00:22:19,157
Now this is great.

318
00:22:20,117 --> 00:22:21,478
Even if you want to go back,

319
00:22:21,558 --> 00:22:22,437
you can't.

320
00:22:23,851 --> 00:22:25,130
I don't have a home.

321
00:22:29,837 --> 00:22:31,077
Look at you,

322
00:22:32,197 --> 00:22:33,597
your master treats you so well.

323
00:22:34,317 --> 00:22:35,477
You are so ungrateful.

324
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:38,877
It's precisely because
my master treats me well

325
00:22:38,957 --> 00:22:40,637
that I can't leave.

326
00:22:40,717 --> 00:22:41,877
Can Ms Shen take care of

327
00:22:41,957 --> 00:22:43,597
both you and Grandma alone?

328
00:22:48,497 --> 00:22:49,297
I say,

329
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:52,317
has your master not contacted you
for several days?

330
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,919
They are all busy.

331
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:02,077
Looks like your master has abandoned me.

332
00:23:08,437 --> 00:23:09,237
Nephew No. 2,

333
00:23:10,197 --> 00:23:10,997
don't worry.

334
00:23:11,437 --> 00:23:14,197
As long as I'm around,
your life won't be in danger.

335
00:23:16,477 --> 00:23:17,597
I say,

336
00:23:18,998 --> 00:23:21,437
although you performed acupuncture on me

337
00:23:21,823 --> 00:23:23,504
under your master's guidance,

338
00:23:23,998 --> 00:23:24,877
it is also

339
00:23:24,957 --> 00:23:27,197
under my guidance and supervision.

340
00:23:28,357 --> 00:23:29,237
I think

341
00:23:29,317 --> 00:23:31,518
you should get a new master.

342
00:23:31,918 --> 00:23:33,751
Don't be stubbornly attached
to one side.

343
00:23:33,837 --> 00:23:34,640
Starting from tomorrow,

344
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,680
you will ask to be my disciple.

345
00:23:40,038 --> 00:23:41,197
Don't underestimate me

346
00:23:41,317 --> 00:23:42,398
and think I'm incapable.

347
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:44,837
Even though your master is renowned,

348
00:23:45,077 --> 00:23:48,197
don't forget that I am also
a influential figure in Jiangzhou.

349
00:23:50,317 --> 00:23:51,678
Even if I can't be number one,

350
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:53,517
I can at least

351
00:23:53,597 --> 00:23:54,518
be number two.

352
00:23:56,077 --> 00:23:57,477
I'm only telling you this,

353
00:23:57,798 --> 00:23:58,918
if anyone else

354
00:23:59,077 --> 00:24:00,678
wants to become my disciple,

355
00:24:01,957 --> 00:24:03,077
I won't even bother.

356
00:24:04,038 --> 00:24:05,837
I see how dedicated you have been

357
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,040
taking care of me these days.

358
00:24:09,077 --> 00:24:11,357
That's why I'm willing
to let go of the grudge,

359
00:24:11,957 --> 00:24:13,437
and I don't mean you,

360
00:24:13,717 --> 00:24:15,317
I mean the grudge against your master,

361
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,600
and accept you as my student.

362
00:24:18,703 --> 00:24:19,722
Don't hesitate anymore.

363
00:24:27,717 --> 00:24:29,837
That's quite a tempting offer.

364
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:34,996
I've made up my mind.

365
00:24:35,077 --> 00:24:36,304
Made up your mind about what?

366
00:24:39,109 --> 00:24:40,442
Once I'm out of the hospital,

367
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,841
I will kowtow to Senior Master.

368
00:24:44,317 --> 00:24:45,877
If he could teach
the two of you so well,

369
00:24:45,957 --> 00:24:47,877
then teaching me should not
be a problem, right?

370
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,996
It's settled, I will kowtow
to Senior Master.

371
00:24:50,077 --> 00:24:51,077
Child,

372
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:53,477
I don't admire anyone else,
but I truly admire you.

373
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,520
Even when you turn someone down,

374
00:24:56,117 --> 00:24:58,136
you manage to do it tactfully
without hurting our relationship.

375
00:25:03,437 --> 00:25:05,357
Hello, everyone. I'm Dr Peng.

376
00:25:05,558 --> 00:25:07,357
I will teach everyone how to make

377
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,597
Fried Rice Tea and Egg Dumplings
in today's live stream.

378
00:25:09,678 --> 00:25:10,478
Let's start with

379
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:12,717
the Egg Dumplings.

380
00:25:14,317 --> 00:25:16,357
(Class representative, Xiao Hong,
are you ready?)

381
00:25:16,437 --> 00:25:17,717
All ready to go.

382
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:20,278
First, let's put oil

383
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,481
in the pan

384
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:24,189
and evenly preheat it.

385
00:25:25,317 --> 00:25:28,197
Then, we'll add
the previously beaten eggs.

386
00:25:29,197 --> 00:25:30,077
As for the dumplings,

387
00:25:30,197 --> 00:25:32,837
I've chosen Shrimp Supreme Dumpling.

388
00:25:33,276 --> 00:25:34,757
These dumplings have

389
00:25:34,837 --> 00:25:36,158
whole and large shrimp inside.

390
00:25:36,597 --> 00:25:39,478
Shrimp meat contains abundant protein

391
00:25:39,558 --> 00:25:42,437
and essential trace elements
needed by the human body.

392
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:45,310
So, we should eat more shrimp meat.

393
00:25:47,597 --> 00:25:50,190
The heat of the oil is about right.
Now we can add the dumplings.

394
00:25:52,837 --> 00:25:55,158
Cook them on low heat for three minutes.

395
00:25:55,437 --> 00:25:57,117
Remember, it must be low heat.

396
00:26:00,117 --> 00:26:00,917
Careful!

397
00:26:02,077 --> 00:26:03,478
This is very normal.

398
00:26:03,558 --> 00:26:04,918
You know that, right?

399
00:26:05,317 --> 00:26:06,397
The eggs fried this way

400
00:26:06,477 --> 00:26:07,997
taste especially good, you know?

401
00:26:10,837 --> 00:26:12,956
Class representative, Xiao Hong,
was just a little impatient.

402
00:26:13,037 --> 00:26:14,936
We were supposed to add the eggs later.

403
00:26:16,437 --> 00:26:18,717
(Don't criticise her anymore.
Or she won't be frying the pan anymore,)

404
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:19,717
(she will be toasting you.)

405
00:26:21,077 --> 00:26:21,877
Oh, my God.

406
00:26:29,203 --> 00:26:30,003
Where is it?

407
00:26:30,837 --> 00:26:32,358
On the right. Bingfeng acupoint.

408
00:26:32,837 --> 00:26:33,637
Tianzong acupoint.

409
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,840
And around Xinshu acupoint.

410
00:26:39,717 --> 00:26:43,158
Is that really important whether
or not Tou Tou is my daughter?

411
00:26:44,317 --> 00:26:45,477
One day as a teacher,

412
00:26:46,437 --> 00:26:47,678
a lifetime as a father.

413
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:52,038
Isn't that how it is
in our ancient Chinese culture?

414
00:26:53,317 --> 00:26:54,398
The master

415
00:26:55,437 --> 00:26:56,798
is like a father.

416
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,361
It's different.

417
00:27:03,558 --> 00:27:05,317
You really can't accept Tou Tou

418
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:07,597
as a member of our family?

419
00:27:10,597 --> 00:27:11,397
I can't accept that

420
00:27:11,477 --> 00:27:12,983
you have someone else in your heart.

421
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,680
Why have I been together

422
00:27:17,197 --> 00:27:18,678
with you for so many years?

423
00:27:20,296 --> 00:27:21,857
You always donate money

424
00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:23,916
and visit other cities to
provide medical support.

425
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,715
I never complained

426
00:27:25,796 --> 00:27:26,877
and fully supported you.

427
00:27:27,369 --> 00:27:28,702
But you haven't treated me well.

428
00:27:29,717 --> 00:27:31,558
Other couples enjoy romance and love,

429
00:27:32,077 --> 00:27:33,117
but with you,

430
00:27:33,197 --> 00:27:34,277
it's always about hardships

431
00:27:34,357 --> 00:27:35,518
and sacrifices.

432
00:27:38,077 --> 00:27:40,158
I've been the one holding
this family together.

433
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:41,917
In the end,

434
00:27:42,197 --> 00:27:44,710
I can't even get your loyalty,
which is the most basic thing.

435
00:27:45,303 --> 00:27:46,103
What should I do?

436
00:27:47,903 --> 00:27:49,503
You've destroyed my trust.

437
00:27:50,558 --> 00:27:51,951
Now that I've told you the truth.

438
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:53,878
Have I earned your trust again?

439
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,320
No.

440
00:28:00,077 --> 00:28:02,757
There's something that
has been weighing on my mind,

441
00:28:02,837 --> 00:28:04,116
and I want to ask you directly.

442
00:28:05,283 --> 00:28:07,810
Today, you must give me
an honest answer.

443
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,041
What's the deal

444
00:28:16,317 --> 00:28:17,597
between you and Little Lark?

445
00:28:20,197 --> 00:28:21,558
What's your relationship?

446
00:28:25,678 --> 00:28:27,357
I only said that I was Tou Tou's father.

447
00:28:27,597 --> 00:28:29,676
Now you're even trying
to find her mother for me?

448
00:28:38,477 --> 00:28:40,263
(The fact that you've been
searching for her all these years)

449
00:28:40,558 --> 00:28:41,670
(shows that)

450
00:28:42,197 --> 00:28:43,650
(you can't forget about her, right?)

451
00:28:44,117 --> 00:28:44,917
(If she hadn't)

452
00:28:45,237 --> 00:28:46,798
(dropped out of school back then,)

453
00:28:47,717 --> 00:28:49,798
(maybe we wouldn't have
started our relationship.)

454
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:52,077
So, your trust

455
00:28:52,717 --> 00:28:55,038
was built on doubt all along?

456
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,440
Have you always had her in your heart?

457
00:29:00,717 --> 00:29:01,518
Have you?

458
00:29:04,837 --> 00:29:05,637
Yes.

459
00:29:07,357 --> 00:29:08,237
Listen,

460
00:29:10,317 --> 00:29:12,197
it's not what you imagine.

461
00:29:13,837 --> 00:29:16,717
Do you know why Little Lark
dropped out of school?

462
00:29:17,237 --> 00:29:18,437
It's because of me.

463
00:29:22,918 --> 00:29:24,477
I made a mistake

464
00:29:26,197 --> 00:29:28,190
that caused her to lose
her hearing in both ears.

465
00:29:32,957 --> 00:29:33,878
You don't know this,

466
00:29:35,477 --> 00:29:37,096
but the hardships I faced on my journey

467
00:29:38,237 --> 00:29:40,317
to learn TCM knowledge

468
00:29:41,798 --> 00:29:42,718
were unimaginable

469
00:29:42,798 --> 00:29:44,397
for descendants of TCM families

470
00:29:44,477 --> 00:29:45,638
like you.

471
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:48,517
In order to learn the essence of TCM,

472
00:29:48,597 --> 00:29:50,077
I had studied under many masters.

473
00:29:52,837 --> 00:29:54,117
(Now it seems that)

474
00:29:55,038 --> 00:29:56,317
(some of those masters)

475
00:29:56,957 --> 00:29:58,597
(had limitation in their knowledge.)

476
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,561
(At that time,)

477
00:30:03,077 --> 00:30:05,357
(I didn't have the ability
to discern their shortcomings.)

478
00:30:06,117 --> 00:30:07,437
I will insert the needle now.

479
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:19,917
(I didn't know)

480
00:30:20,437 --> 00:30:22,077
the gravity of it.

481
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,481
I was bold

482
00:30:25,317 --> 00:30:26,117
but lacked

483
00:30:27,717 --> 00:30:29,317
a very good teacher

484
00:30:29,717 --> 00:30:30,757
to guide me.

485
00:30:30,837 --> 00:30:32,570
I was just experimenting
on my treatments.

486
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,601
You can't imagine

487
00:30:36,236 --> 00:30:38,476
how innocent and naive

488
00:30:38,717 --> 00:30:40,437
those people were

489
00:30:42,837 --> 00:30:43,998
(in those days.)

490
00:30:46,117 --> 00:30:46,998
(She believed in me)

491
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,480
(and let me treat her.)

492
00:31:05,437 --> 00:31:06,237
And the result...

493
00:31:09,197 --> 00:31:10,197
What happened?

494
00:31:12,717 --> 00:31:13,517
The result was...

495
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,240
She became deaf in both ears.

496
00:31:25,957 --> 00:31:28,597
At that time,
I thought it was temporary.

497
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,760
We sought treatment

498
00:31:31,316 --> 00:31:33,637
from both TCM and Western doctors.

499
00:31:35,197 --> 00:31:36,477
Six months passed,

500
00:31:38,038 --> 00:31:39,671
and it was too late to change anything.

501
00:31:47,343 --> 00:31:48,743
Stop blaming yourself.

502
00:31:49,357 --> 00:31:50,759
Little Lark left without telling anyone

503
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,686
because she didn't want
to see you like this.

504
00:31:53,616 --> 00:31:56,038
She even packed her stuff by herself.

505
00:31:57,197 --> 00:31:57,997
Study well.

506
00:31:58,717 --> 00:31:59,998
The only thing you can do

507
00:32:00,597 --> 00:32:02,403
to atone for it
is to become a great doctor.

508
00:32:15,597 --> 00:32:18,117
My heart always aches
when I think about her,

509
00:32:18,197 --> 00:32:19,077
you know?

510
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:20,971
If there's anyone

511
00:32:24,077 --> 00:32:26,077
I've failed in my life,

512
00:32:27,437 --> 00:32:28,717
it's Little Lark.

513
00:32:33,403 --> 00:32:34,243
It was a mistake,

514
00:32:35,918 --> 00:32:37,757
but in a way, it was also a good thing.

515
00:32:37,837 --> 00:32:39,038
Because of her,

516
00:32:39,957 --> 00:32:42,197
I have truly devoted myself to studying.

517
00:32:42,717 --> 00:32:46,357
I want to learn pure TCM

518
00:32:46,437 --> 00:32:48,117
and become the best doctor.

519
00:32:48,309 --> 00:32:50,189
No matter where she is,

520
00:32:50,717 --> 00:32:51,957
I will find her.

521
00:32:53,558 --> 00:32:55,717
With my current understanding of TCM,

522
00:32:57,317 --> 00:32:58,357
I want to take a chance.

523
00:33:05,237 --> 00:33:06,037
I know

524
00:33:07,957 --> 00:33:09,558
you have always approached TCM

525
00:33:10,597 --> 00:33:11,517
with caution

526
00:33:11,597 --> 00:33:12,837
and meticulousness,

527
00:33:15,477 --> 00:33:16,437
and treated patients

528
00:33:17,317 --> 00:33:18,558
with utmost care.

529
00:33:20,038 --> 00:33:20,838
I didn't realise

530
00:33:21,197 --> 00:33:23,450
that it was Little Lark
who made you who you are today.

531
00:33:26,317 --> 00:33:28,837
Then, did you see her
at the class reunion?

532
00:33:30,197 --> 00:33:30,997
Yes, I did.

533
00:33:33,558 --> 00:33:35,117
She is still as cheerful as ever.

534
00:33:36,957 --> 00:33:39,038
She didn't utter a word
of resentment towards me.

535
00:33:42,077 --> 00:33:43,317
Didn't you treat her?

536
00:33:45,317 --> 00:33:46,558
I couldn't convince her.

537
00:33:47,477 --> 00:33:49,398
She said she had given up on treatment.

538
00:33:50,038 --> 00:33:52,437
She has adapted to the quiet world.

539
00:33:56,038 --> 00:33:57,237
I feel so regretful.

540
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:06,718
Xin Zheng...

541
00:34:10,197 --> 00:34:10,997
When we...

542
00:34:12,197 --> 00:34:13,878
When we leave Wuhan,

543
00:34:14,642 --> 00:34:15,963
bring me to her.

544
00:34:16,837 --> 00:34:17,957
I will convince her.

545
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,801
I will treat her, okay?

546
00:34:23,197 --> 00:34:23,997
Okay.

547
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,120
Let's seal it.

548
00:34:31,136 --> 00:34:32,536
You are my dearest wife.

549
00:34:35,683 --> 00:34:37,683
But I'm still mad at you.

550
00:34:38,678 --> 00:34:40,038
I mean,

551
00:34:43,317 --> 00:34:45,038
something this huge

552
00:34:46,237 --> 00:34:47,398
has been weighed

553
00:34:48,077 --> 00:34:50,437
on your heart for decades.

554
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,960
Yet you didn't even tell your wife.

555
00:34:54,357 --> 00:34:55,477
You just didn't...

556
00:34:56,229 --> 00:34:57,389
You just didn't trust me.

557
00:34:58,558 --> 00:34:59,957
Telling you

558
00:35:00,918 --> 00:35:02,277
would only make one more person

559
00:35:02,357 --> 00:35:05,077
carry the guilt in this world.

560
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,801
Guilt doesn't solve anything.

561
00:35:14,717 --> 00:35:16,758
The only thing I could do
is to keep learning

562
00:35:18,038 --> 00:35:19,717
and improving myself.

563
00:35:20,823 --> 00:35:22,703
I may have a chance
to change the result.

564
00:35:26,558 --> 00:35:27,358
But

565
00:35:28,957 --> 00:35:31,317
this big rock must be so heavy
in your heart.

566
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:34,210
How many things have you kept inside?

567
00:35:37,437 --> 00:35:38,837
Now you understand

568
00:35:40,038 --> 00:35:41,357
why I've been so strict

569
00:35:41,437 --> 00:35:42,717
with Tian Zhen.

570
00:35:45,598 --> 00:35:47,157
While others praise him,

571
00:35:47,677 --> 00:35:48,838
I scold him.

572
00:35:49,157 --> 00:35:52,118
I just don't want him to be like me,

573
00:35:52,677 --> 00:35:54,038
to be easily swayed

574
00:35:54,957 --> 00:35:56,478
by a little bit

575
00:35:56,558 --> 00:35:58,717
of praise and opportunities,

576
00:35:59,118 --> 00:36:00,157
forgetting

577
00:36:01,397 --> 00:36:02,637
the value of life.

578
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:06,237
I don't want him to make

579
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,799
the same lifelong regrets that I did.

580
00:36:12,677 --> 00:36:13,637
He won't.

581
00:36:14,598 --> 00:36:16,038
Our son won't.

582
00:36:17,397 --> 00:36:18,197
He really

583
00:36:18,964 --> 00:36:20,837
looks like a doctor now.

584
00:36:20,983 --> 00:36:21,783
Yes.

585
00:36:22,637 --> 00:36:24,877
Through this epidemic, I've seen it.

586
00:36:25,677 --> 00:36:26,677
This kid

587
00:36:28,318 --> 00:36:29,844
is cut out to be a TCM practitioner.

588
00:36:30,637 --> 00:36:32,038
His pure heart

589
00:36:32,118 --> 00:36:33,397
matches his name,

590
00:36:34,477 --> 00:36:35,278
Tian Zhen.

591
00:36:36,318 --> 00:36:37,118
I know, right?

592
00:36:55,877 --> 00:36:56,758
Let me ask you.

593
00:36:57,877 --> 00:36:59,397
Have you ever

594
00:37:01,598 --> 00:37:02,637
had feelings

595
00:37:03,838 --> 00:37:04,798
for Little Lark?

596
00:37:06,637 --> 00:37:08,397
You know, like a secret crush.

597
00:37:09,038 --> 00:37:09,917
Even Dad said

598
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:10,910
that you and her

599
00:37:11,038 --> 00:37:12,877
were evenly matched in your class.

600
00:37:13,118 --> 00:37:14,798
Wu Shan Dao was even a bit behind her.

601
00:37:16,197 --> 00:37:17,477
That's narrow-minded.

602
00:37:20,118 --> 00:37:23,358
Do you think there's only romantic
love between a man and a woman?

603
00:37:24,637 --> 00:37:26,336
There's also another kind of connection,

604
00:37:27,558 --> 00:37:29,397
a mutual appreciation.

605
00:37:29,969 --> 00:37:31,209
Come on,

606
00:37:31,397 --> 00:37:33,077
just admit that you had a crush on her.

607
00:37:33,157 --> 00:37:34,957
What mutual appreciation?

608
00:37:36,358 --> 00:37:37,397
I've been thinking,

609
00:37:39,276 --> 00:37:40,117
if I didn't

610
00:37:40,598 --> 00:37:41,838
have feelings

611
00:37:42,358 --> 00:37:44,078
for someone else back then,

612
00:37:44,757 --> 00:37:46,158
given my mistakes,

613
00:37:47,437 --> 00:37:48,278
I should have...

614
00:37:49,157 --> 00:37:50,329
I should have married her.

615
00:37:51,637 --> 00:37:53,637
She wouldn't have ended up

616
00:37:54,157 --> 00:37:55,038
alone until now.

617
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,320
Ren Xin Zheng,

618
00:38:01,598 --> 00:38:02,917
come clean now.

619
00:38:03,798 --> 00:38:05,717
How many women are there in your heart?

620
00:38:06,118 --> 00:38:07,651
Who else did you have feelings for?

621
00:38:10,477 --> 00:38:11,716
I don't dare to say anymore.

622
00:38:13,118 --> 00:38:13,918
Tell me!

623
00:38:14,637 --> 00:38:15,598
Tell me!

624
00:38:18,877 --> 00:38:20,477
Stop trying to scare me by coughing.

625
00:38:22,917 --> 00:38:23,717
Have some water.

626
00:38:45,677 --> 00:38:47,518
Do you remember

627
00:38:47,598 --> 00:38:49,038
where we first met?

628
00:38:49,157 --> 00:38:50,358
Of course I remember.

629
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,081
You always forget,

630
00:38:52,197 --> 00:38:54,163
saying that it was
during our university days.

631
00:38:55,397 --> 00:38:57,318
Actually, I noticed you
long before that.

632
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,433
It was when you were
in your second year of university.

633
00:39:00,877 --> 00:39:03,437
You came to our house to talk to my dad
about your thesis.

634
00:39:04,318 --> 00:39:06,717
We were on the rooftop of the old house.

635
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:08,676
I was in high school at that time.

636
00:39:09,038 --> 00:39:12,677
The first time we met was at the school.

637
00:39:13,677 --> 00:39:15,558
Not when you started school,

638
00:39:16,263 --> 00:39:18,144
but when I started university.

639
00:39:20,318 --> 00:39:21,197
I think

640
00:39:22,078 --> 00:39:23,397
at that time,

641
00:39:24,598 --> 00:39:26,864
you must have been in
your first senior year of high school.

642
00:39:28,038 --> 00:39:29,558
You were wearing a blue dress.

643
00:39:43,598 --> 00:39:45,317
Lan Lan!

644
00:39:45,397 --> 00:39:47,118
-Make way!
-Slow down!

645
00:39:49,038 --> 00:39:50,397
Unbelievable!

646
00:39:50,477 --> 00:39:51,918
Slow down! Be careful!

647
00:39:52,558 --> 00:39:53,750
Careful not to hit someone!

648
00:39:56,118 --> 00:39:56,918
You...

649
00:39:59,318 --> 00:40:00,557
Move! Move!

650
00:40:00,637 --> 00:40:01,598
Don't ride so fast!

651
00:40:03,397 --> 00:40:04,918
Move! Move!

652
00:40:06,477 --> 00:40:07,277
Watch out!

653
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,877
Why haven't I seen you wearing
the blue dress again after that?

654
00:40:28,237 --> 00:40:29,037
Oh, right.

655
00:40:29,397 --> 00:40:31,197
Where did that blue dress go?

656
00:40:31,516 --> 00:40:33,157
How come I couldn't find it later?

657
00:40:34,838 --> 00:40:37,118
Why did you only tell me this now?

658
00:40:37,717 --> 00:40:39,950
Were you planning
to keep it a secret from me forever?

659
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:44,331
We need to save our trump cards

660
00:40:45,038 --> 00:40:46,717
for critical moments.

661
00:40:48,598 --> 00:40:50,477
You're just too cunning.

662
00:40:51,078 --> 00:40:52,917
What's wrong with being cunning?

663
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,321
Unlike you,

664
00:40:55,078 --> 00:40:57,598
whose mind is so easy to read.

665
00:40:58,909 --> 00:40:59,710
Now you understand

666
00:40:59,798 --> 00:41:02,118
why your father passed on
the position to me

667
00:41:02,796 --> 00:41:04,117
instead of you, right?

668
00:41:04,303 --> 00:41:05,624
You women

669
00:41:06,078 --> 00:41:09,477
always ask men if they love you or not.

670
00:41:10,237 --> 00:41:11,358
Do you love me?

671
00:41:11,637 --> 00:41:13,238
Tell me! Tell me!

672
00:41:13,318 --> 00:41:14,638
Tell me! Tell me!

673
00:41:16,637 --> 00:41:18,677
Actually, I'm confessing my love to you

674
00:41:19,397 --> 00:41:21,078
with my whole life.

675
00:41:27,877 --> 00:41:28,838
Do you understand now?

676
00:41:29,637 --> 00:41:31,136
You don't feel jealous now, do you?

677
00:41:32,677 --> 00:41:34,078
Am I the jealous one?

678
00:41:35,038 --> 00:41:35,838
I am.

679
00:41:39,917 --> 00:41:42,157
Now, I have to tell you
about another thing

680
00:41:43,118 --> 00:41:44,957
that you might not be happy about.

681
00:41:46,877 --> 00:41:48,798
There aren't so
many unhappy things in life.

682
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:51,091
It's all happy things. Happy things.

683
00:41:52,157 --> 00:41:54,837
Life has a way
of slapping you in the face,

684
00:41:54,917 --> 00:41:56,518
reminding you

685
00:41:56,798 --> 00:41:59,558
of the emotional vulnerabilities
you have.

686
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:01,637
Let it slap, let it be.

687
00:42:02,157 --> 00:42:03,077
With you by my side,

688
00:42:03,157 --> 00:42:05,637
I have a suit of armour.

689
00:42:07,157 --> 00:42:08,637
Life's default setting

690
00:42:09,237 --> 00:42:11,318
is ups and downs,

691
00:42:11,598 --> 00:42:12,917
twists and turns.

692
00:42:13,798 --> 00:42:15,238
When you embrace something joyful,

693
00:42:15,318 --> 00:42:17,717
there's always something sad
waiting for you.

694
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:20,949
There aren't that many sad things.

695
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,760
When you have the love of your life,

696
00:42:22,823 --> 00:42:23,903
it's all joy.

697
00:42:25,957 --> 00:42:27,717
You no longer doubt

698
00:42:28,118 --> 00:42:29,717
that Tou Tou is my daughter,

699
00:42:30,477 --> 00:42:33,358
but she may become
our daughter-in-law.

700
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,531
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

701
00:42:37,642 --> 00:42:39,080

traditional Chinese medicine books)
