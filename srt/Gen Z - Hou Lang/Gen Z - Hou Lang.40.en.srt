1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,600
Having ups and downs

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,280
and bumpy roads

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,920
are the standard of life.

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,157
After a joyous event,

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,680
a sorrowful event
is bound to be waiting for you.

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,520
There are not many sorrows.

7
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,360
It's a joy

8
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:21,920
to have someone in your life.

9
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,680
You no longer doubt

10
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,680
that Tou Tou is my daughter.

11
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,597
But she may be

12
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,320
our daughter-in-law.

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,560
Look at your expression.

14
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,000
This isn't a sorrowful event.

15
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,760
Your son has a wife.

16
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,840
This is a joyous event!

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,800
This...

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Is this a joyous event?

19
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,080
How do you know?

20
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,917
Can't you accept it
if you have another younger sister?

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,677
I don't want a younger sister!

22
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,517
You took my future away!

23
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,440
I have nothing left!

24
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,560
As a mother,

25
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,920
don't you even understand your son?

26
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,720
As a wife,
I don't even understand my husband!

27
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,600
Alright.

28
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,760
Just wait to bless them.

29
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,680
At the end of our life,

30
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,800
nothing is ours.

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,680
Your son is not yours.

32
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,960
He belongs to his wife.

33
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,720
I'll

34
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,120
take care of you.

35
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,200
Stop worrying about them.

36
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,560
Why the humming?

37
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,440
You should be happy.

38
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,640
I think

39
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,160
the inheritor of our family

40
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,680
may be Tou Tou.

41
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,760
Your son

42
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,637
can get someone like Tou Tou.

43
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,320
That means he is blessed.

44
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,880
Tou Tou can handle things well.

45
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,080
You're right.

46
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,720
Okay.

47
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,160
I don't care

48
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,560
and I can't control it anymore.

49
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,360
You've stopped being stubborn already?

50
00:02:21,133 --> 00:02:22,077
Or what?

51
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,073
Or

52
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,880
be yourself.

53
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,640
Don't bother

54
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,040
with the kids' matter.

55
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,360
Tou Tou

56
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,160
is indeed a good girl.

57
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,920
Only our family can handle her.

58
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,040
As expected of my wife.

59
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,200
You can't afford to take it,

60
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,200
but you can let it go.

61
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,840
Nonsense! You're so annoying!

62
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,320
Aren't you going to tell Tou Tou?

63
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,360
Do you want to see
the two kids getting tortured?

64
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,000
You tell them

65
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,440
such a joyous event.

66
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,240
I'll let you be the good guy.

67
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,640
I'll give you a big gift.

68
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,400
Get along well with
your daughter-in-law in the future.

69
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,920
Thank you, my husband.

70
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,680
Good for you, my wife.

71
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,120
(Video Call)

72
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,440
(The other part has declined)

73
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,440
(Is it inconvenient right now?)

74
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,680
(Let's not see each other for now.)

75
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,920
(I'm afraid I won't be able to stop
myself from going home when I see you.)

76
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,760
(I can't leave this place yet.)

77
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,320
(But, can you send
a voice message to me?)

78
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,440
(But, can you send
a voice message to me?)

79
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,320
(Hold to talk)

80
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,040
(Ren Xin Zheng)

81
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,400
(Zhao Li Quan)

82
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,720
(Come.)

83
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,800
(Take two steps.)

84
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,280
(Take two steps.)

85
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,040
Did you see it?

86
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,320
He can walk now!

87
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,600
I'm fine now, dear wife.

88
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,040
Wu, you must work hard.

89
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,840
I'm waiting for you.

90
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,760
(Wuhan Must Win)
(China Must Win)

91
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,800
Good!

92
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,800
They even have a pulse-checking style.

93
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,720
Like this.

94
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,040
This is called...

95
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:07,880
What are you doing?

96
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,400
What are you doing?

97
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,440
Tou Tou, dance!

98
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,920
Just dance!

99
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,760
Don't fool around!

100
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,000
Mom, look!

101
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,677
Get down to business.

102
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,560
Get down to business.

103
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,920
Good.

104
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,960
Come on! Come on!

105
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,680
Let's dance together!

106
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,080
Xiao Hong!

107
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,520
Xiao Hong!

108
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,200
My dear Hong.

109
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,720
I, Peng Shi Yan,

110
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,800
am an outstanding graduate of
the Preparation of Pregnancy.

111
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,520
Can you consider

112
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,760
to be my child's mother?

113
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,640
Stop, stop.

114
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,320
This is a very serious matter.

115
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,317
Marry you

116
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,037
is the very, very, very,

117
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,400
very serious matter in my life.

118
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,000
You are the love of my life
that I have fought for.

119
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,240
We have fought shoulder to shoulder.

120
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,557
I cannot accept that

121
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,757
you are not there in my future life.

122
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,917
I can't even imagine

123
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,160
the mother of my future child isn't you.

124
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,917
When I think of our children

125
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:43,917
can come to the medical center with us,

126
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,400
I feel very warm in my heart.

127
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,800
So,

128
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,320
Ms. Yang Xiao Hong,

129
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,400
can you consider carefully

130
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,000
to marry me?

131
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,477
Marry him!

132
00:11:54,560 --> 00:12:01,560
Marry him!

133
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,437
Well, I have considered very carefully,

134
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,120
that's why I stopped you.

135
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,160
It's not that I don't want to marry you.

136
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,880
But

137
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,520
we must sign a prenuptial agreement.

138
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,917
For example,
should we register a marriage first

139
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,917
or get a child first.

140
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,160
We must make this clear.

141
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,917
So, if I'm infertile,

142
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,080
will you abandon me?

143
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,077
Yes, we'll be fair.

144
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,757
If I'm infertile,
you can abandon me too.

145
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,917
All I want is you.

146
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,440
If we have children,
that will be a complement to me!

147
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,400
No, I want kids!

148
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,957
So, we must make this clear.

149
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,520
If you are infertile,

150
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,200
can I go to the sperm bank
and pick a sperm?

151
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,837
Would you like
to be the father of the kid?

152
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,477
Of course, for the sake of equality,

153
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,637
if I'm infertile,

154
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,640
you can also go inside the egg bank
and pick an egg.

155
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,680
Do you agree?

156
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,997
I agree, and I am willing.

157
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,120
I'm definitely up for it.

158
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,440
So,

159
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,760
if both of us are infertile,

160
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,877
would you like to adopt one?

161
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,720
All of these must be
written and included in the terms.

162
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,000
Xiao Hong.

163
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,360
How many terms do you have?

164
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,640
Name it all.

165
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,480
Well, I will go back

166
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,877
and list out one by one,

167
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,557
and then confirm each of them with you.

168
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,520
So, do you want this ring or not?

169
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,760
The ring...

170
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,760
Of course, I must take the ring, right?

171
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,117
This is the first time
someone proposed to me.

172
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:28,997
I must take it.

173
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,560
Wait a minute.
What if we don't agree on the terms?

174
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,957
I will not return this ring though.

175
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,280
It'll be written in advance.

176
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,240
Everyone heard it, right?

177
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,520
You heard it, right?

178
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,157
It's pretty nice.

179
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,040
Do you like it?

180
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,520
I won't return it.

181
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,800
I have a wife now!

182
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:04,880
Liu Zi Hong!

183
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,077
Are you sick?

184
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:06,917
Tou Tou!

185
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,477
What are you doing, Liu Zi Hong?

186
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,037
Are you sick?

187
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:10,877
I'm not sick.

188
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,320
What are you doing?

189
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,677
And then there are Tou Tou and I.

190
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,997
Who wants to be with you?

191
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,000
No.
I was here to send blessings.

192
00:14:20,086 --> 00:14:21,846
Looks like I still have a chance.

193
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:24,880
Look.

194
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,520
Your lineage shows that
you are the rightful inheritor.

195
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,640
I

196
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,680
am a rich second generation
with some successes.

197
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,280
We're a match!

198
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,560
Who matches you?

199
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,560
Liu Zi Hong, I don't want
to mess around with you here.

200
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,480
Let's team up.

201
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,680
Our future prospect

202
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,840
and future money

203
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,840
will be immeasurable.

204
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,360
You're sick, really.

205
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,317
I, Liu Zi Hong, am 28 this year.

206
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,280
I'm 185 cm.

207
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,200
I'm a reserve dancer
of the national hip-hop team.

208
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,280
You are my first love.

209
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,560
I will be good to you.

210
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,240
It's her family's decision that counts.

211
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,560
Wait a minute.

212
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,200
Get up!

213
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,440
I ask you to get up!

214
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,560
Liu.

215
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,040
How dare you

216
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,320
snatch my son's girlfriend
in front of me.

217
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,200
Do you want to get pricked with needles?

218
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:25,880
No.

219
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,440
You...

220
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:30,880
You...

221
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:31,880
Isn't she...

222
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,360
Aren't you a family?

223
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,120
Of course, we are a family.

224
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,240
Tou Tou is my daughter-in-law.

225
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,640
That means she is my daughter.

226
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,640
Professor Ren is right.

227
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,040
Shouldn't you change
how you address us now?

228
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,920
When did you know about it?

229
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,997
It's when that brat

230
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,960
ran to me and say,

231
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,920
"Doesn't your conscience hurt?"

232
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,440
It was at that time.

233
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,757
It shouldn't be like this!

234
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,680
I cannot accept this!

235
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,200
This kid...

236
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,080
Kiss her!

237
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,240
Kiss her!

238
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:18,200
Kiss her!

239
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,597
My wife!
My wife!

240
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,477
Good news!

241
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,920
Put on the mask.

242
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,520
Good news!

243
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,117
Let me tell you. It's really...

244
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,000
You don't have to tell me.

245
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,320
I've told you.

246
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,160
Tou Tou is definitely from our family.

247
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:55,840
Brilliant.

248
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,200
You're really brilliant.

249
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,320
So, there are

250
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,880
four generations in our family now.

251
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,200
This is good.

252
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Do you still remember

253
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,560
what happened
the first time we were here?

254
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,400
How could I forget about it?

255
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,960
Who can compete with me

256
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,400
when the sky is the limit?

257
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,720
Who can slay the dragon

258
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,400
with a great sword in his hand?

259
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,680
Great!

260
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,720
Excellent!

261
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,197
I think you got me drunk
on purpose at that time.

262
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,880
You just wanted
to drive me away, didn't you?

263
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,280
I've never seen

264
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,357
someone like you my whole life.

265
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,880
A shameless person.

266
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,880
It's innocent and unaffected.

267
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,160
I didn't hate you back then.

268
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:45,940
I was jealous of you.

269
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:49,846
I was jealous of you
that you can live freely.

270
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,560
But

271
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,880
I'm glad I didn't miss you.

272
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,197
Well, in fact,

273
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,040
we have created a miracle.

274
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,480
Miracle?

275
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,800
You've never heard that

276
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,240
lovers become siblings, right?

277
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,920
We've broken the curse.

278
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,560
This is the power of faith.

279
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,760
Actually, I have never

280
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,560
thought of giving up.

281
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,320
What is this?

282
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,600
Open it and take a look.

283
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,680
Where did you get this?

284
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,960
We've seen the information

285
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,440
on the Internet.

286
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,197
That's when we could really understand

287
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,080
the pain that

288
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,400
Meng Meng suffered at that time.

289
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,160
Thank you so much.

290
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,720
Thank you for always voicing up for her

291
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,200
and punishing the bad guy.

292
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,240
This thing...

293
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,320
I received it by accident.

294
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,800
I think

295
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,480
it should be returned
to the original owner.

296
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,720
Consider this as a gift from me.

297
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,480
Don't you pawn it.

298
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,120
Don't worry.

299
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,920
I won't lose any of you.

I still have no confidence in this.

Why not...

334
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:44,880
Tou Tou.

335
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,920
You have completed
the apprentice class examination.

336
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,320
You've also completed

337
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,237

338
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,680

340

341
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,920
I will not disappoint you.

342

Not only me.

343
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,240
This is also the order from the state.

344
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,600
Understand?

345
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,640
Young people like you

346
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,400
will shoulder the responsibility

347
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,320
of the future
of this field and this land.

348
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,360
Think about this.

349
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,680
Today is the first graduation ceremony

350
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,880
for our apprentice class.

351
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,680
It is also the sacrificial ceremony
of Qingming Festival.

352
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,200
So, the host of this event

353
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,360
must be you.

354
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,760
I'm afraid of embarrassing...

355
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,560
I'm afraid of embarrassing you.

356
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:37,920
How about this?

357
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,280
Let Tian Zhen do it.

358
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,077
He grew up watching this.

359
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,680
He is more familiar than me.

360
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,720
Okay?

361
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,160
Aren't you

362
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,720
Tou Tou who fears nothing?

363
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,360
You have the guts to hate
even heaven and earth.

364
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,920
This is not like you.

365
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,200
You're not Sun Tou Tou.

366
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,880
I also

367
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:06,957
didn't study

368
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,080
and have respect for others.

369
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,800
Don't mention this.
Let's not talk about the past.

370
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,080
Are you afraid that
others will hear about it?

371
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,400
Tell me this.

372
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,560
Tell me about this.

373
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,160

374
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,280
Didn't you ask me

375
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,477
to read

376
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,357
"House of Confucius" in
Records of the Grand Historian,

377
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,360
and Mencius?

378
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,080
I've finished reading them.
They're very touching.

379
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,800
Tell me about it.

380
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,920
Confucius was heartbroken

381
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,680
at Yan Hui's death.

382
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,880
It's because he thought
no one would inherit his legacy.

383
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,040
But he had never seen Mencius before.

384
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,520
But Mencius

385
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,240
wanted to pass on his ideas.

386
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,040
So, I was thinking about this.

387
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,200
Is bloodline

388
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,800
really that important

389
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,920
for the Chinese?

390
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,520
But I figured it out now

391
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,000
because I saw you.

392
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,280
Now that I saw you,

393
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,440
I think it isn't important.

394
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,000
I am not your biological child.

395
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,680
But the effort you put into me

396
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,000
are much more than your son.

397
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,480
So, for me,

398
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,560
bloodline isn't important.

399
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,120
Who my biological parents are

400
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:29,840
isn't important as well.

401
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:30,840
No.

402
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,560
Parents are important.

403
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,080
Look. The reason

404
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,677
why the Chinese culture
has such a long history

405
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,920
and successors

406
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,600
is actually

407
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,080
not because of lineage.

408
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,680
It's actually the cultural lineage.

409
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:49,840
It's not the bloodline.

410
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
It's actually the Confucian orthodoxy.

411
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,760
In fact,
the real inheritance should be

412
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:56,960
the thought.

413
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,080
It is a continuation of the spirit.

414
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,160
Take your time to figure it out.

415
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:03,840
Good.

416
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,200
It seems that you didn't
waste time reading those books.

417
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,760
Thank you, Master.

418
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,200
No.

419
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,680
Actually, I want to thank you.

420
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,280
It was my master

421
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,717
who arranged

422
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:29,280
the homework of
mentoring Monkey Sun to me.

423
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:31,880
You don't know about this, right?

424
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,557
You see. Even I'm at this age,

425
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,640
I have to learn again about benevolence

426
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,200
and love.

427
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,200
I promised my master that

428
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,040
you would become a great one.

429
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,040
That's why I'm so grateful to you

430
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,080
for giving me such a chance

431
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,560
to practice the Disciple Gauge again.

432
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,160
Previously, I understand the concept.

433
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,560
But right now,

434
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,840
I can finally walk the talk.

435
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,280
It's not easy to mentor me, right?

436
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,400
It was a tough life.

437
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,640
A tough life.

438
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,120
Tough life?

439
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,080
Help me.

440
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,720
Let me help you.

441
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:50,880
By the way, Master.

442
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,760
I am an inheritor.

443
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,880
Isn't the name "Sun Tou Tou"

444
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,120
sounds not serious enough?

445
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,200
What do you mean?

446
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,000
I'd like you to

447
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,280
give me a name.

448
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,560
I've always thought about this.

449
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,640
Give me a name

450
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,000
where once you call it
and people hear it,

451
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,640
they'll know that this is someone

452
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:19,880
who is educated

453
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,480
and cultured.

454
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,920
Let me think about it.

455
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:25,920
Sun...

456
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:27,800
Cultured.

457
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,640
I think that in Chinese literature,

458
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,920
the most successful character should be

459
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:37,840
Sun Wukong.

460
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,680
Look, he has no parents

461
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,320
and he popped out of a rock.

462
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,680
But in the end,

463
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,360
he went through
a long and painful journey to the west

464
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,440
and became a hermit.

465
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,320
One must

466
00:35:52,147 --> 00:35:53,667
wish for the best.

467
00:35:54,413 --> 00:35:56,690
Even if your life is bumpy,

468
00:35:56,807 --> 00:35:58,607
you won't muddle through.

469
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,880
So, I'll name you...

470
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,878
Sun Da Yuan (great ambition).

471
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,117
Sun Da Yuan.

472
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,080
Think about it.

473
00:36:14,747 --> 00:36:16,307
Actually, I hope you

474
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,800
have big ambition

475
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,800
and achieve great accomplishments.

476
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,280
Sun Da Yuan.

477
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:34,120
Sun Da Yuan.

478
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:40,040
Sun Da Yuan!

479
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,600
Here!

480
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,960
Lao Tzu said,

481
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,960
"When a man
is virtuous to others openly,

482
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,720
people will naturally repay him."

483
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,440
"When a man
is virtuous to others in secret,

484
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,760
the demons and gods will repay him."

485
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,197
"When a man does evil to others openly,

486
00:38:29,334 --> 00:38:30,979
people will
naturally retaliate against him."

487
00:38:31,259 --> 00:38:32,939
"When a man
does evil to others secretly,

488
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,920
the demons and gods
will come and harm him."

489
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,200
"Based on these
two aspects of behavior,

490
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,200
what you get in return
depends on how you treat others."

491
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,840
"Tell me, is this a lie?"

492
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,520
"And show off your skills."

493
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,840
"This is
inconsiderate and irresponsible."

494
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,480
"I hope that those who study medicine

495
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,200
will not despise me
for the vulgarity of my words,

496
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:33,680
for I am determined
to save the world."

497
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,197
(The prescriptions and remedies
