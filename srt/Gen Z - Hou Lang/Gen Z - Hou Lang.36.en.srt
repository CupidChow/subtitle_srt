1
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,720
I'm not angry at all.

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,480
I just feel

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:10,960
disappointed.

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,440
Do you know this? When I...

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,877
When I looked at him,

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,317
(he avoided my eyes.)

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,560
(At that time, I felt...)

8
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,360
I suddenly felt like

9
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,040
we were strangers.

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,120
I was utterly disappointed.

11
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,680
I once thought we loved each other.

12
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:50,160
So, it was just my imagination
all along.

13
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,480
I'm a joke.

14
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,080
I'm a huge joke.

15
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,600
My daughter,

16
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,800
actually,

17
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,560
I'm pretty envious of you.

18
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,320
You're envious of me?

19
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,997
I became a laughing stock

20
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:14,917
in front of everyone.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,160
You're saying that
you're envious of me?

22
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,200
Putting everything aside,

23
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,360
you're not young yourself.

24
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,360
However, you're still crying

25
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,600
and laughing

26
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,440
over love and relationships.

27
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,880
If your father

28
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,557
were to tell me

29
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,160
that he had
an illegitimate child outside,

30
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,120
I would bring the child back
immediately.

31
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,600
I know.

32
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,720
You don't understand what's going on.

33
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,640
Actually,

34
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,800
in this world,

35
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,520
nothing belongs to us,

36
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,240
no matter if it's our children

37
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,640
or our husbands.

38
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,840
The only things that truly belong to you

39
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,960
are your feelings

40
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,880
toward life.

41
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,400
In the end,

42
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,160
the only ones who can keep us company
for the rest of our lives

43
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,760
are ourselves.

44
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,080
Mum.

45
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,480
If we are alone

46
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,760
from the start,

47
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,397
why should I love other people?

48
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,560
Why should I dedicate myself to them?

49
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,680
It's because you have
the ability to love.

50
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,640
Since you have the ability to love,

51
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,520
and possess the energy of love,

52
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,680
you have to project

53
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,240
your love toward others.

54
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,560
Both love and hate

55
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,040
require energy.

56
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,280
Now, I don't feel happiness or sorrow.

57
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,400
It's because

58
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,720
I ran out of energy.

59
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,680
That's why I said I'm envious of you.

60
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,120
Mum,

61
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,040
I'm running out of energy too.

62
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,680
You can't let that happen.

63
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,560
You have to love.

64
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,160
What are you doing here?

65
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,160
What's the matter?

66
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,120
What's wrong? Speak up.

67
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,680
What happened?

68
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,720
I have a father now.

69
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,000
You have a father now? That's great!

70
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,000
Tian Zhen's father is my father.

71
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,320
Why are you sighing?

72
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,120
Your liver meridians are blocked.

73
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,520
Come, I'll give you
acupuncture treatment.

74
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,760
No, thanks.

75
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,680
Our family is falling apart.

76
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,440
I just feel sorry for Tian Zhen.

77
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,197
Now, his father isn't his father

78
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,040
and his girlfriend isn't his girlfriend.

79
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,440
How can they live together
in the future?

80
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,320
This is nothing.

81
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,840
How can he achieve success

82
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,200
when he can't overcome
a small obstacle like this?

83
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,440
Everything is menial to you.

84
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,360
Listen. This is a huge deal
for ordinary people.

85
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,440
Wisdom comes from experience.

86
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,480
Just look at Sima Qian.

87
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,160
Here you go again. You only know
about the story of Sima Qian.

88
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,400
You're going to say things like
he was castrated, right?

89
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,600
This world would be much more peaceful

90
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,480
if all men were castrated.

91
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,000
Don't say that I talk without restraint.

92
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,040
It's not that women
talk without restraint.

93
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,760
It's just that men
act without restraint.

94
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,120
I was referring to Stephen Hawkins.

95
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,760
He could question

96
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,880
the entire universe
just with two fingers.

97
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,160
What are you talking about?

98
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,200
All is vast and flows round
without stopping,

99
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,440
and extends to the farthest,
and then returns to its origin.

100
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,560
Everything in the world
consists of a cycle.

101
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,600
There aren't that many
interesting things in the world.

102
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,840
Let's just take the incident
in our family as an example.

103
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,517
It's already a cliche

104
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,120
in most dramas.

105
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,000
Just give them some time.

106
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,160
I believe that they'll get over it.

107
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,080
Let me ask you something then.

108
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,077
Is Tou Tou truly Xin Zheng's...

109
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,200
Over numerous mountains and streams,
I had doubts that I could find the road.

110
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,280
Then out of the shade of the willows,
came bright flowers and another village.

111
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,317
Why are you

112
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,877
always on a different frequency?

113
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,600
I was referring to
a philosophical problem.

114
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,560
Philosophical problem?

115
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,120
You're so annoying.

116
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,880
You're lying!

117
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,120
You lied to us!

118
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,000
Tell me the truth.

119
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,320
Sun Tou Tou is my daughter.

120
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,600
You're lying!

121
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,960
Why should I lie?

122
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,077
I just can't understand

123
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,480
why you're trying to lie here!

124
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,120
You just have a new younger sister.

125
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,117
Can't you accept that fact?

126
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,040
I don't want a younger sister!

127
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,600
Seek virtue and acquire it.

128
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,840
If you seek something,

129
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,280
you'll acquire it.

130
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,317
You robbed me of my future!

131
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,280
I have nothing left!

132
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,040
You're still young.

133
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,317
How could you have no future left?

134
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,840
There are many possibilities
to the future.

135
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,920
You should go and console your mother.

136
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,160
How?

137
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,480
You want me to make her
forgive your mistake?

138
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,157
You want her to forgive
your audacious act

139
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,240
and for being sanctimonious?

140
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,280
I can't bear to bring that up.

141
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,757
And, she always needs you,

142
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:06,960
not me!

143
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,080
But she has forgotten

144
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,437
that you're the most selfless

145
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,520
and selfish person in the family!

146
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,037
(Tian Zhen)

147
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,160
(Tou Tou)

148
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,840
(Tian Zhen)

149
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,880
(Tian Zhen)

150
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,560
It's snowing.

151
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,120
Say,

152
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,360
do you desire a father?

153
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,400
Or do you desire a boyfriend?

154
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,840
After studying under Master, I realised

155
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,720
that I could change my fate
with my own hands.

156
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,920
I can change my fate as long as I study

157
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,600
and work hard.

158
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,280
But now, I realised

159
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,960
that God has actually made arrangements
for everything.

160
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,637
I was wondering why

161
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,400
a stranger was treating you that nicely.

162
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,480
He bailed you out of the police station,

163
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,960
(paid for your education fee,)

164
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,320
(and taught you his skills.)

165
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,240
(He treated you
better than anyone else.)

166
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,520
So, you're his daughter.

167
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,957
(Sun Tou Tou isn't)

168
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,800
(the successor of the Jiang family's
acupuncture sect.)

169
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,517
(However, no one here)

170
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,520
(is worthy enough to stand here
except for her.)

171
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,360
(It's because she's my daughter.)

172
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,520
(Say that again?)

173
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,480
(She's my daughter.)

174
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,480
(She's my daughter.)

175
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,320
Where are you going?

176
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,040
Senior Uncle is still in the hospital.

177
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,600
No one is taking care of him.
I have to return to the hospital.

178
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,280
(Master,)

179
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,800
(what's the acupuncture treatment plan)

180
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,400
(for Senior Uncle tomorrow?)

181
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,160
(Maintain the same plan. However,
we need to change the medicine.)

182
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,240
(Okay.)

183
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,680
(I'll send the prescription to
Yang Xiao Hong. She'll take it to you.)

184
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,400
(Okay.)

185
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,200
(Where are you?)

186
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,520
(Master, I'm beside Senior Uncle.
I'm taking care of him.)

187
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,320
Our family hasn't fallen apart, right?

188
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,560
If that's the case,

189
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,360
let's start with pulse reading.

190
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:04,960
Where's Tian Zhen?

191
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,640
Why isn't he joining us?

192
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,077
Granny,

193
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,600
give me a set of keys
for the house on Anfu Road.

194
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,840
Come for pulse reading first

195
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,037
and take your meal.

196
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,240
We can talk after that.

197
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,040
I'm not taking anything. I'm leaving.

198
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,280
Where are you going?

199
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,200
You're not allowed to leave the house.

200
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:23,840
Tian Zhen,

201
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,560
that house

202
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,517
is now the warehouse
for the medical centre.

203
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,760
The house is filled with
all kinds of herbs.

204
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,277
There's not even a mattress there.

205
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,160
I'll clean it up myself.

206
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,400
Please stay out of this.

207
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,840
The keys.

208
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,520
There's only one set.

209
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,840
Don't lose it.

210
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,520
Go and make another set

211
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,600
when you're free.

212
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,240
Got it.

213
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,000
Let's eat.

214
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,800
Let's eat.

215
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,680
(Jiangzhou People's Hospital)

216
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,880
Do you remember who am I?

217
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,960
I don't remember.

218
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,160
Think again.

219
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,600
Do we know each other?

220
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,480
Thank you for visiting me.

221
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,720
You look great today.

222
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,397
You have to take more food.

223
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,760
I don't want to poop on the bed.

224
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,160
You...

225
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,157
Even if you don't want to
poop on the bed,

226
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,760
you still have to eat.

227
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,280
You should eat by yourself if you can.

228
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,600
You won't look as handsome
if you lose weight.

229
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,560
Tou Tou will take care of you.

230
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,480
Thank you, angel.

231
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,120
Thank you, angel.

232
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,080
She's your angel indeed.

233
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,520
She's been taking care of you
all this while.

234
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,520
Shen Xin?

235
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,240
You still remember her?

236
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,880
She's your wife now.

237
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,277
She's currently at home,

238
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,840
taking care of your mother.

239
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,880
Your mother has been experiencing
hypertension lately.

240
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,760
Her body is weak.

241
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,240
Hypertension.

242
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:45,520
She sends your mother
to the medical centre every day.

243
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,080
Ms Dong is taking care of her now.

244
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,640
Thank you, Angel Dong.

245
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,480
Thank you, Angel Dong.

246
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,600
Do you truly not recognise me?

247
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,920
You're a living Buddha.

248
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,520
A living Buddha.

249
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,160
Li Quan, you're here.

250
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,880
Mr Ren, I'm here to visit Mr Wu.

251
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,000
Mr Wu.

252
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,840
Do you still recognise me?

253
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,560
Do you still recognise him?

254
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,640
Hello, angel.

255
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,397
Thank you for visiting me.

256
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,000
I'm not an angel.

257
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,280
I'm your student.

258
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,800
All those who visit you are angels.

259
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,560
Mr Li is happy

260
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,280
that your visitors are
bringing life to the hospital.

261
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,160
Angel,

262
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,240
it's been a few days since I pooped.

263
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,760
Can you buy some Glycerin Enema for me?

264
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,480
Okay, I'll order it now.

265
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,640
It'll arrive by this afternoon.

266
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,600
I need it now.

267
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,400
Okay then. I'll buy it now.

268
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,400
Thank you, angel.

269
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,840
Thank you, angel.

270
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,680
Angel.

271
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,200
Angel?

272
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,800
I want a foot bath.

273
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,037
I'll go and get the water.

274
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,080
Thank you, angel.

275
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,480
Thank you, angel.

276
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,760
Thank you, angel.

277
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,760
Two.

278
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,880
Two.

279
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,520
Two plus two equals?

280
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,640
I know.

281
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,280
What do you know?

282
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,360
Do you know who I am?

283
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,397
You're Ren Xin Zheng, my senior.

284
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,760
You were the ex-principal
of the academy.

285
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,640
You scared me.

286
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,960
You're fine?

287
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,120
Yeah.

288
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,760
Why are you pretending then?

289
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,157
Listen.

290
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,240
This is more than just an accident.

291
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,160
Was it Zhao Li Quan?

292
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,517
I can't be sure

293
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,877
that he pushed me

294
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,360
by accident

295
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,160
or on purpose.

296
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,240
You must be terrified, huh?

297
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,200
I'll close the door.

298
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,440
Say,

299
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,120
why did you think Zhao Li Quan

300
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,720
did it?

301
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,360
He wanted me

302
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,440
to give him the price list for the
medicine that the hospital would buy

303
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,865
so that he could
adjust the price of the

304
00:24:18,948 --> 00:24:20,500
medicine he sells and
compete with the rest.

305
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:21,789
He even tried to bribe me

306
00:24:21,873 --> 00:24:23,232
by giving me a bank card.

307
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,080
However, I didn't agree to it.

308
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,277
This should be

309
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,760
his manager, Mr Tu's idea.

310
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,120
I thought so too initially.

311
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,757
But when I was unconscious,

312
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,960
he visited me

313
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,120
one night.

314
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,000
He was holding a cloth in his hand.

315
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,760
Luckily, he realised his mistake.

316
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,640
He sat beside my bed and cried.

317
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,000
I was heartbroken too.

318
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,400
Mr Wu, I'm sorry.

319
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,560
I'm sorry.

320
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,200
So,

321
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,160
I cannot be sure of it.

322
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,640
However, he should

323
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,520
still have the money with him.

324
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,040
So,

325
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,040
when you were in a coma,

326
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,880
your blood pressure started to rise

327
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,480
whenever he was near you.

328
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,437
All of you guys thought I was in a coma.

329
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,440
You guys were wrong.

330
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,240
Actually,

331
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,480
I was conscious.

332
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,480
I just couldn't speak

333
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,160
or protect myself back then.

334
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,960
That's why I was terrified.

335
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,040
What do you plan to do then?

336
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,880
I wish to discuss this matter with you.

337
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,160
If we call the cops on him,

338
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,400
his life will be ruined.

339
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,120
However, if we don't,

340
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,557
how can we make him realise

341
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,880
his own mistakes?

342
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,440
He's committing a crime here.

343
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,520
He has to return the money.

344
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,880
If not, the consequences will be dire.

345
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,280
He's your student.

346
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,520
You can decide the plan.

347
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,240
I'll just execute it.

348
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,440
I just want to ask you

349
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,640
what you would do

350
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,000
if he was your student.

351
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,280
You should hurry up.

352
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,760
He'll return soon.

353
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,240
I already closed the door.

354
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,520
You see,

355
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,840
in life,

356
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,600
everyone makes mistakes sometimes.

357
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,360
So,

358
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,040
we need mentors.

359
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,917
Heaven, Earth, King, Parent, Teacher.

360
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,920
Teacher

361
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,720
is the base

362
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,840
for the other four figures.

363
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,400
You see, Zhao Li Quan's family

364
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,160
is poor.

365
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,440
He has a huge burden.

366
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,437
That's right.

367
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,880
It's not uncommon for him
to have such thoughts.

368
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,840
Luckily, he still has
some conscience left.

369
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,880
He didn't silence you.

370
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,957
Therefore, we need to educate

371
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,040
and punish him.

372
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,040
If he was my student,

373
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,600
I should give him an out.

374
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,077
If he can realise

375
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,400
his own mistakes,

376
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,360
I can forgive him.

377
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,037
However, as to whether

378
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,040
God is willing to forgive him or not,

379
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,397
it depends on

380
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,960
the level of his self-reflection.

381
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,880
Don't worry. I'll deal with him.

382
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,640
Alright, it's decided then.

383
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,000
You can come up with the idea

384
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,040
while I'll deal with the execution.

385
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,600
We'll bear the responsibility together.

386
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,920
We'll split the money too.

387
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,040
However, I need to tell you
something beforehand.

388
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,677
No matter

389
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,520
how smooth my recovery process goes,

390
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,120
I no longer remember

391
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,760
what happened in the past.

392
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,840
Are you afraid that
he might try to harm you again?

393
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,677
If he wishes to harm me again,

394
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,560
he'll be done for.

395
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,880
I'm not remembering the past

396
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,680
so that we can proceed with our lives
just like usual.

397
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,360
I have to acknowledge you as my teacher.

398
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,757
I never thought

399
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,520
that you were this amazing in the past.

400
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,277
I was

401
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,520
worried

402
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,400
that you might turn into an idiot
after the incident.

403
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,320
Now,

404
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,880
not only have you not
turned into an idiot,

405
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,760
but you're also much smarter.

406
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,000
Do I look like

407
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,120
I'm an idiot?

408
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:49,840
Next,

409
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,040
just treat me

410
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,040
until I can walk properly.

411
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,560
I don't want anyone to serve me,

412
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,120
especially the girl.

413
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,880
I don't understand at all.

414
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,077
Why didn't you hire

415
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,160
a male caretaker for me before this?

416
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,720
Wu Shan Dao,

417
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,720
you should be grateful to her.

418
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,240
No one could say for sure

419
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,957
if you could survive until now

420
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:15,000
if Sun Tou Tou wasn't
taking care of you.

421
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,680
Let me tell you something.

422
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,437
I told everyone

423
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,400
that Sun Tou Tou was my daughter.

424
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,120
I know that.

425
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,840
But,

426
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,640
what about Ling Lan's feelings?

427
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,720
I always suspected

428
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,520
that you had feelings for my wife.

429
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,680
I think my suspicion might be correct.

430
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,960
Am I right?

431
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,360
Fine.

432
00:30:55,444 --> 00:30:56,677
Be gentle!

433
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,357
-Am I right?
-Be gentle!

434
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,560
Master, open the door.

435
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,317
Angel, I'm starving.

436
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,037
Give me food.

437
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:05,960
I'll spare you this time.

438
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,240
Okay.

439
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:09,756
Give me food.

440
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,280
I'm starving.

441
00:31:11,364 --> 00:31:13,255
(Jiangzhou People's Hospital)

442
00:31:14,773 --> 00:31:17,373
(Winter Solstice has
the least amount of sunlight)

443
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:22,480
(and its daytime is the shortest.)

444
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:28,240
(In the North, people have the habit
of taking dumplings during this day.)

445
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,160
(To them, Winter Solstice is just as
important as Chinese New Year.)

446
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:40,400
(Winter Solstice)

447
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,493
Granny,

448
00:31:56,577 --> 00:31:58,346
pack some dumplings
and Winter Solstice soup for me.

449
00:31:58,430 --> 00:31:59,310
I'll be bringing them with me.

450
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,240
You're leaving already?

451
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,140
Did you clean up the place?

452
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,360
Yes.

453
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,000
It's Winter Solstice.

454
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,320
Aren't you joining us for dinner?

455
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,200
Nope.

456
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,040
You're delivering food to Tou Tou?

457
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,957
I don't want her to be alone

458
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,000
and live on the breadline.

459
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,480
You should have some before leaving.

460
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,840
Granny,

461
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,040
Grandpa,

462
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,640
I'll be leaving now.

463
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:57,800
(Jiangzhou People's Hospital)

464
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,353
These are fresh clothes for her.

465
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,802
It also contains brushes,
ink, papers, and inkstones.

466
00:34:01,886 --> 00:34:03,046
Leave them here.

467
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,600
She can write when she's free.

468
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,873
There's also a pair of
cotton-padded shoes.

469
00:34:06,153 --> 00:34:07,473
Remind her to wear it.

470
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,080
Are you sure
you don't want to visit her?

471
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,600
Maybe next time.

472
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,320
I don't have the courage to see her now.

473
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,720
I don't think

474
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,600
she'll be happy to see me now.

475
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,600
You two are something else.

476
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,440
Alright.

477
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:38,717
The food won't be as good
if it gets cold.

478
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,960
You should deliver it to her.

479
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,280
I'll make a move first.

480
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,560
You're finally here.

481
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,240
Eat it while it's hot.

482
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,000
Did he deliver it here?

483
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,757
I wonder if he

484
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,600
has taken the Winter Solstice soup.

485
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,920
It tastes just like Granny's cooking.

486
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,600
(I still had something
I didn't tell you.)

487
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,560
(You're not alone.)

488
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,000
(Your family,)

489
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,440
(your loved ones,)

490
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,400
I'll make it up to you eventually.

491
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,760
(I spent the good merit
I gathered since 20 years ago)

492
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,160
(on our relationship.)

493
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,400
You're still mine.

494
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,520
What did you tell him?

495
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,037
I said you were the only one
in my heart.

496
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,400
I have no space for anyone else.

497
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,800
It's Winter Solstice.

498
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,720
It's not like it's my funeral.

499
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,560
Why are you pulling a long face?

500
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,240
Even the dumplings
don't taste as good now.

501
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,320
Hey, say something.

502
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,560
When eating, do not converse.
When in bed, do not speak.

503
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,160
Just eat.

504
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,200
Leave the window open.

505
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,280
Mr Ren,

506
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,840
were you looking for me?

507
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,440
Have a seat.

508
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,200
Let's have some tea.

509
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,040
You can brew the tea today.

510
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,480
Mr Ren, I don't know how to brew tea.

511
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,000
You can learn.

512
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,840
Okay.

513
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,680
Mr Ren,

514
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,800
why did you call me here today?

515
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:30,800
For no particular reason.

516
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,440
The tea is ready.

517
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:36,840
Please.

518
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,760
Try it and tell me how you feel.

519
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,920
I'm not well-versed in this field.

520
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,080
I cannot tell if it's good or bad.

521
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,280
It doesn't matter if you can't tell
whether the tea is good or bad.

522
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,360
However, you need to be able to
differentiate between right and wrong.

523
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,640
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

524
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,080
(are referenced from relevant
traditional Chinese medicine books)

00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,560
