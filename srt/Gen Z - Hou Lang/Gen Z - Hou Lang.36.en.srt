(Episode 35)

3
00:01:38,508 --> 00:01:42,406
(30 Years Ago)

4
00:01:48,657 --> 00:01:49,555
Wait a moment.

5
00:02:03,337 --> 00:02:04,177
Will you marry me?

6
00:02:42,457 --> 00:02:43,496
Back then,

7
00:02:44,256 --> 00:02:45,737
this place wasn't this beautiful.

8
00:02:46,536 --> 00:02:48,216
You guys only planted

9
00:02:48,536 --> 00:02:51,377
herbs and grasses.

10
00:02:53,536 --> 00:02:56,377
Do you remember I brought you
a bouquet of flowers?

11
00:02:57,496 --> 00:02:59,657
(You stared at it like a fool.)

12
00:02:59,896 --> 00:03:01,057
(I told you to take a sniff.)

13
00:03:01,977 --> 00:03:03,856
(And you despised it.)

14
00:03:09,496 --> 00:03:10,377
I did it on purpose.

15
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,754
(The arrival of Minor Snow)

16
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:29,648
(means that the weather
will turn colder and colder.)

17
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,625
(As the weather turns cold,
the amount of rain will increase.)

18
00:03:34,607 --> 00:03:36,760
(Minor Snow is just a metaphor.)

19
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,440
(It means that there will only
be a minor amount of snow.)

20
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:47,450
(Minor Snow)

21
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,960
(Jiangzhou People's Hospital)

22
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,720
What are you doing? It's late now.

23
00:04:00,857 --> 00:04:02,697
-Come here.
-Why did you come here suddenly?

24
00:04:02,697 --> 00:04:03,640
Sit down.

25
00:04:05,777 --> 00:04:06,616
Look.

26
00:04:08,057 --> 00:04:08,857
It's something warm.

27
00:04:11,697 --> 00:04:12,616
What do you mean by this?

28
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:15,697
You see, as a girl,

29
00:04:15,697 --> 00:04:17,577
you must maintain your cleanliness.

30
00:04:17,777 --> 00:04:18,896
No matter how busy you are,
you need to wash your feet.

31
00:04:26,337 --> 00:04:27,536
Are you complaining that my feet stink?

32
00:04:27,937 --> 00:04:28,977
I dare not do so.

33
00:04:29,417 --> 00:04:30,977
I love them to death.

34
00:04:36,057 --> 00:04:37,456
Since you're not coming to me,

35
00:04:38,577 --> 00:04:39,857
I'll go to you then.

36
00:04:41,577 --> 00:04:42,577
How's the temperature?

37
00:04:44,857 --> 00:04:46,297
Why are you still carrying your shoes?

38
00:04:47,417 --> 00:04:48,256
You're a neat lady, huh?

39
00:04:52,616 --> 00:04:54,977
Will you be this long-winded
in the future?

40
00:05:02,857 --> 00:05:03,789
Tou Tou,

41
00:05:04,697 --> 00:05:06,616
when I celebrated your birthday for you,

42
00:05:06,977 --> 00:05:08,616
I still had something I didn't tell you.

43
00:05:11,297 --> 00:05:12,337
You're not alone.

44
00:05:13,977 --> 00:05:16,057
Your family, your loved ones,

45
00:05:18,137 --> 00:05:19,777
I'll make it up to you eventually.

46
00:05:29,417 --> 00:05:31,057
I brought you some fresh clothes.

47
00:05:31,777 --> 00:05:33,297
Remember to get changed

48
00:05:33,337 --> 00:05:34,417
in Xing Xing's room later.

49
00:05:34,977 --> 00:05:36,337
I'll collect the dirty laundry tomorrow.

50
00:05:39,057 --> 00:05:40,297
You just want to complain about me.

51
00:05:48,217 --> 00:05:49,195
Tou Tou,

52
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:51,496
as a girl,

53
00:05:52,297 --> 00:05:54,376
you should be more meticulous

54
00:05:54,577 --> 00:05:55,776
and particular.

55
00:05:56,017 --> 00:05:58,056
What if our daughter takes after you

56
00:05:58,336 --> 00:05:59,617
in the future?

57
00:05:59,617 --> 00:06:00,897
You can raise her yourself then.

58
00:06:02,177 --> 00:06:03,047
Okay.

59
00:06:08,336 --> 00:06:10,376
But are you sure you don't want
to head home?

60
00:06:11,177 --> 00:06:12,776
There are nurses on duty here.

61
00:06:13,297 --> 00:06:15,177
You can sleep better at home.

62
00:06:15,536 --> 00:06:16,697
This way, you'll have more energy
on the next day.

63
00:06:18,737 --> 00:06:20,297
I have to stand guard over here.

64
00:06:20,577 --> 00:06:22,417
I won't go back unless
Master tells me to.

65
00:06:23,056 --> 00:06:24,056
Your master can't just let you

66
00:06:24,056 --> 00:06:25,776
stand guard over here all day long.

67
00:06:26,336 --> 00:06:28,017
You need to eat and sleep somehow.

68
00:06:29,577 --> 00:06:31,177
Will you obey your master
or your husband?

69
00:06:32,977 --> 00:06:34,536
Why are you saying that again?

70
00:06:36,137 --> 00:06:37,737
What if the students of the apprentice
class take turns to stay here?

71
00:06:37,737 --> 00:06:39,617
No. I don't trust other people.

72
00:06:41,216 --> 00:06:42,936
Do you trust me then?
I'll take your shift.

73
00:06:42,977 --> 00:06:44,216
I don't.

74
00:06:44,857 --> 00:06:46,056
You're close to Zhao Li Quan.

75
00:06:46,056 --> 00:06:47,617
You'll go easy on him
if he says he wants to go inside.

76
00:06:48,177 --> 00:06:50,017
In the end,

77
00:06:50,017 --> 00:06:51,776
you still don't trust Li Quan.

78
00:06:54,697 --> 00:06:57,177
I won't trust him

79
00:06:57,897 --> 00:06:58,857
until the truth is out.

80
00:07:01,617 --> 00:07:02,617
But don't worry.

81
00:07:03,177 --> 00:07:04,536
I've already told Roubecca.

82
00:07:04,737 --> 00:07:06,177
She'll take my shift every three days.

83
00:07:07,617 --> 00:07:09,496
You would rather trust Roubecca than me?

84
00:07:09,737 --> 00:07:11,216
It's because Roubecca
is a trustworthy person.

85
00:07:11,216 --> 00:07:12,536
It's either she doesn't agree to it,

86
00:07:12,536 --> 00:07:14,297
or she does a good job
after agreeing to it.

87
00:07:14,457 --> 00:07:15,656
If she stands guard over here,

88
00:07:15,897 --> 00:07:17,457
not even a fly can get inside.

89
00:07:20,177 --> 00:07:21,078
Fine.

90
00:07:29,496 --> 00:07:30,977
First, you were jealous of your father.

91
00:07:31,737 --> 00:07:33,376
Now, you're jealous of Roubecca.

92
00:07:33,577 --> 00:07:35,577
Were you born

93
00:07:35,577 --> 00:07:36,737
out of jealousy?

94
00:07:42,017 --> 00:07:43,017
You're ignoring me now?

95
00:07:46,617 --> 00:07:48,177
Take this!

96
00:07:48,617 --> 00:07:49,457
You want to play, huh?

97
00:07:49,457 --> 00:07:50,336
Take this!

98
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,040
(Jiangzhou People's Hospital)

99
00:08:30,897 --> 00:08:31,857
Listen.

100
00:08:31,857 --> 00:08:33,737
I could tell that you didn't focus
during the technique class.

101
00:08:34,017 --> 00:08:35,376
You couldn't find my acupressure point.

102
00:08:35,376 --> 00:08:36,177
Higher.

103
00:08:36,496 --> 00:08:37,457
-Here?
-Higher.

104
00:08:41,216 --> 00:08:42,047
That's the spot.

105
00:08:46,216 --> 00:08:47,017
That's the spot.

106
00:08:47,017 --> 00:08:50,496
Tou Tou, I have something
important to ask you.

107
00:08:52,737 --> 00:08:53,577
What is it?

108
00:08:58,216 --> 00:08:59,897
What's with you and Liu Zi Hong?

109
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:10,216
So, you found out about us?

110
00:09:12,017 --> 00:09:12,992
I...

111
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,203
(15 Days Ago)

112
00:09:22,897 --> 00:09:23,945
Tou Tou.

113
00:09:25,563 --> 00:09:26,461
I like you.

114
00:09:30,776 --> 00:09:31,697
I don't.

115
00:09:32,457 --> 00:09:34,017
Hey, I'm serious. I like you.

116
00:09:34,017 --> 00:09:35,760
I'm serious too. I don't.

117
00:09:39,056 --> 00:09:40,857
Liu Zi Hong, listen.

118
00:09:41,297 --> 00:09:42,496
Your public persona will crumble

119
00:09:42,496 --> 00:09:43,656
before you get famous.

120
00:09:43,897 --> 00:09:44,812
Wait.

121
00:09:44,897 --> 00:09:46,936
It's not like I'm everyone's
dream boyfriend.

122
00:09:48,017 --> 00:09:48,890
Give me the cloth.

123
00:09:49,577 --> 00:09:50,437
Wait.

124
00:09:50,577 --> 00:09:52,216
It's not like I'm going to be
everyone's dream boyfriend.

125
00:09:52,336 --> 00:09:54,017
If I do get into a relationship,

126
00:09:54,017 --> 00:09:55,297
I won't hide it from them.

127
00:09:55,297 --> 00:09:56,256
My fans

128
00:09:56,256 --> 00:09:57,737
are just audience.

129
00:09:57,737 --> 00:09:58,601
It's not like they're God.

130
00:09:59,457 --> 00:10:00,977
I'm making the decision myself.

131
00:10:00,977 --> 00:10:02,056
I'll bear the consequences.

132
00:10:04,457 --> 00:10:05,737
Seems like you've grown up.

133
00:10:06,776 --> 00:10:07,648
So,

134
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:09,430
-is that a yes?
-What are you saying?

135
00:10:10,857 --> 00:10:11,737
Listen.

136
00:10:12,377 --> 00:10:13,536
I just see you as my little brother.

137
00:10:14,377 --> 00:10:15,617
Actually, I don't see you as my brother.

138
00:10:15,817 --> 00:10:17,057
We aren't even close.

139
00:10:17,297 --> 00:10:18,737
Stop saying nonsense like that.

140
00:10:18,737 --> 00:10:20,336
I don't care. I like you.

141
00:10:23,057 --> 00:10:24,776
I like you. I...

142
00:10:28,977 --> 00:10:30,257
Liu Zi Hong, have you lost your mind?

143
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:31,696
I'll go out and tell everyone

144
00:10:31,817 --> 00:10:32,656
that you're my girlfriend.

145
00:10:32,817 --> 00:10:34,136
How could you be so shameless?

146
00:10:34,136 --> 00:10:35,297
-I'm shameless.
-Give it to me.

147
00:10:35,417 --> 00:10:36,359
Nope.

148
00:10:44,857 --> 00:10:45,937
Are you a fool?

149
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:47,417
What's inside your brain?

150
00:10:47,417 --> 00:10:48,737
Is it made of wood?

151
00:10:48,737 --> 00:10:51,096
If there was nothing between you two,

152
00:10:51,336 --> 00:10:52,696
why did he keep looking for you?

153
00:10:52,696 --> 00:10:54,096
And, you even wanted everyone
to vote for him.

154
00:10:54,096 --> 00:10:54,969
Hey.

155
00:10:55,257 --> 00:10:56,617
I can't just tie him up

156
00:10:56,617 --> 00:10:57,817
and tell him to stop looking for me.

157
00:10:57,937 --> 00:10:59,057
But I already told him.

158
00:10:59,377 --> 00:11:00,417
I clarified everything.

159
00:11:00,617 --> 00:11:01,937
He won't look for me again.

160
00:11:01,977 --> 00:11:02,922
What did you tell him?

161
00:11:03,617 --> 00:11:05,857
I said you're the only one
in my heart.

162
00:11:05,857 --> 00:11:07,096
I have no space for anyone else.

163
00:11:12,177 --> 00:11:13,497
But you're a rough lady.

164
00:11:14,617 --> 00:11:16,257
Did he know that you didn't
wash your feet for three days?

165
00:11:16,257 --> 00:11:17,057
Does he still like you
after hearing that?

166
00:11:18,057 --> 00:11:18,922
I...

167
00:11:20,057 --> 00:11:21,737
What have my stinky feet got to do

168
00:11:22,297 --> 00:11:23,257
with him liking me or not?

169
00:11:23,857 --> 00:11:25,576
He didn't wash his feet for a week.

170
00:11:27,497 --> 00:11:29,377
How did you know?

171
00:11:33,377 --> 00:11:34,177
I took a sniff.

172
00:11:35,417 --> 00:11:36,273
That's my fetish.

173
00:11:37,737 --> 00:11:38,857
Sun Tou Tou, you're done for.

174
00:11:38,937 --> 00:11:40,297
No, wait!

175
00:11:40,576 --> 00:11:41,536
Take a sniff. Here.

176
00:11:41,536 --> 00:11:42,737
Feel it.

177
00:11:42,737 --> 00:11:43,609
What are you doing?

178
00:11:45,297 --> 00:11:46,497
Come on, here you go.

179
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:47,737
Smell your stinky sock.

180
00:11:47,737 --> 00:11:49,456
It doesn't stink!

181
00:11:54,057 --> 00:11:55,937
How is it, Tou Tou?
Is Professor Wu doing well?

182
00:11:56,497 --> 00:11:58,096
Everything's normal. All signs

183
00:11:58,096 --> 00:11:59,817
indicate that it's developing
in the right direction.

184
00:11:59,817 --> 00:12:01,057
So you guys don't need to
worry too much.

185
00:12:01,257 --> 00:12:02,617
-Madam Wu.
-Hello, Madam Wu.

186
00:12:02,617 --> 00:12:03,456
Madam, Senior Madam.

187
00:12:03,497 --> 00:12:04,344
Hi.

188
00:12:04,696 --> 00:12:05,578
Tou Tou.

189
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:07,136
Is Shan Dao awake?

190
00:12:07,656 --> 00:12:08,456
How is it?

191
00:12:09,257 --> 00:12:10,057
He's not awake yet.

192
00:12:10,536 --> 00:12:11,656
Did Mr Wu even wake up today?

193
00:12:13,257 --> 00:12:14,737
He's still very weak.

194
00:12:14,937 --> 00:12:16,497
He needs a lot of sleep.

195
00:12:16,737 --> 00:12:17,617
Don't worry.

196
00:12:20,057 --> 00:12:21,977
Tou Tou, according to you,

197
00:12:22,096 --> 00:12:24,096
are you saying that you're the only one
who saw Mr Wu

198
00:12:24,096 --> 00:12:24,992
waking up?

199
00:12:25,297 --> 00:12:26,497
Are you lying to us?

200
00:12:26,857 --> 00:12:27,737
That's not it.

201
00:12:27,737 --> 00:12:29,336
Tou Tou has been
standing guard over here.

202
00:12:29,497 --> 00:12:31,096
There's no reason for her to lie to us.

203
00:12:31,336 --> 00:12:33,177
Maybe she's just trying
to talk herself up.

204
00:12:33,617 --> 00:12:34,456
That's not true.

205
00:12:34,497 --> 00:12:35,977
Yesterday, Xin Zheng said

206
00:12:35,977 --> 00:12:37,057
Shan Dao was fine.

207
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:38,456
He'll recover very soon.

208
00:12:38,497 --> 00:12:39,297
Yeah.

209
00:12:39,297 --> 00:12:40,937
It's like this for patients
who just recovered.

210
00:12:40,937 --> 00:12:43,016
-I met patients like him before.
-Yeah.

211
00:12:43,057 --> 00:12:44,617
Mr Wu has been seriously injured.

212
00:12:44,617 --> 00:12:46,057
He needs to rest and recuperate.

213
00:12:46,177 --> 00:12:47,737
I checked his eyelid's muscle response.

214
00:12:47,857 --> 00:12:50,096
However, there are no other instances
of him regaining consciousness.

215
00:12:50,096 --> 00:12:51,057
Tou Tou said

216
00:12:51,057 --> 00:12:52,617
Professor Wu could talk.

217
00:12:52,617 --> 00:12:53,817
Enough.

218
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:55,177
Let's stop arguing.

219
00:12:56,257 --> 00:12:58,817
What about this? Let's adopt
a shift system starting tonight.

220
00:12:58,817 --> 00:13:00,817
It's too tiring for Tou Tou
to take care of him alone.

221
00:13:00,817 --> 00:13:01,817
She'll develop hallucinations easily.

222
00:13:02,057 --> 00:13:03,617
I'll take care of him tonight.

223
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:04,497
I don't agree with that.

224
00:13:06,737 --> 00:13:08,057
Tou Tou, your senior uncle is awake.

225
00:13:08,737 --> 00:13:09,672
He's awake?

226
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:10,961
He's awake?

227
00:13:11,177 --> 00:13:13,016
-Let's hurry!
-Don't come inside!

228
00:13:13,297 --> 00:13:14,456
This is the ICU!

229
00:13:14,817 --> 00:13:15,765
Let us take a look!

230
00:13:16,177 --> 00:13:17,977
-We're his students.
-I understand your feelings.

231
00:13:17,977 --> 00:13:18,817
I understand your feelings.

232
00:13:19,377 --> 00:13:20,177
Only his family members can come inside.

233
00:13:20,177 --> 00:13:21,297
The rest of you, stay outside.

234
00:13:21,937 --> 00:13:22,937
We're his family members.

235
00:13:30,937 --> 00:13:31,797
Shan Dao?

236
00:13:34,737 --> 00:13:35,696
Wu Shan Dao?

237
00:13:40,257 --> 00:13:41,117
Look.

238
00:13:42,617 --> 00:13:44,136
He has already regained consciousness.

239
00:13:45,456 --> 00:13:46,377
Wu Shan Dao,

240
00:13:46,377 --> 00:13:47,617
do you know who am I?

241
00:13:50,177 --> 00:13:51,101
You...

242
00:13:53,057 --> 00:13:56,737
You are my friend.

243
00:13:58,417 --> 00:14:01,417
Yes. Not only am I your friend,

244
00:14:01,617 --> 00:14:03,977
but I'm also your attending physician.

245
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:05,737
How do you feel?

246
00:14:05,737 --> 00:14:06,617
Are you okay?

247
00:14:07,617 --> 00:14:08,417
Yeah.

248
00:14:09,297 --> 00:14:10,336
Come, shake my hand.

249
00:14:15,297 --> 00:14:18,096
Seems like there's a long way to go
before he fully recovers.

250
00:14:18,737 --> 00:14:21,057
I think we can transfer him
to a normal ward now.

251
00:14:21,417 --> 00:14:23,297
The physiotherapists can help him out
after some time.

252
00:14:23,297 --> 00:14:24,257
Thank you.

253
00:14:24,417 --> 00:14:25,297
-This is great.
-Thank you.

254
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:26,117
Thank you, Mr Li.

255
00:14:26,177 --> 00:14:27,216
Don't be too excited.

256
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:28,977
Let him rest well.

257
00:14:52,297 --> 00:14:53,148
Tou Tou?

258
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:01,664
He's awake.

259
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:02,817
He's awake, huh?

260
00:15:02,977 --> 00:15:03,867
It must've been tough on you.

261
00:15:04,977 --> 00:15:05,896
Okay now.

262
00:15:06,257 --> 00:15:07,737
Don't cry. He's awake.

263
00:15:08,857 --> 00:15:09,776
Everything's fine now.

264
00:15:12,497 --> 00:15:13,937
It must've been tough on you.

265
00:15:13,937 --> 00:15:15,297
Alright now.

266
00:15:16,417 --> 00:15:17,257
Poor little girl.

267
00:15:19,417 --> 00:15:20,367
It's Mr Li.

268
00:15:24,536 --> 00:15:25,383
Hurry.

269
00:15:26,857 --> 00:15:27,937
-You're here too?
-Mr Li.

270
00:15:28,656 --> 00:15:29,696
Your name is Tou Tou, right?

271
00:15:30,257 --> 00:15:32,101
-Yes.
-She's a filial girl.

272
00:15:32,497 --> 00:15:33,456
Your senior uncle

273
00:15:34,057 --> 00:15:34,857
is awake.

274
00:15:34,857 --> 00:15:36,136
Your effort wasn't in vain.

275
00:15:36,857 --> 00:15:39,857
He hasn't regained
his consciousness completely.

276
00:15:40,536 --> 00:15:41,977
He can't recognise everyone.

277
00:15:41,977 --> 00:15:44,177
However, this is already a great start.

278
00:15:44,497 --> 00:15:45,406
Don't cry.

279
00:15:46,096 --> 00:15:46,984
Congratulations.

280
00:15:47,297 --> 00:15:48,737
-Thank you.
-Ren.

281
00:15:49,497 --> 00:15:51,336
It's no wonder people say
that you're a demigod.

282
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,776
If I must say, you're a god.

283
00:15:54,656 --> 00:15:56,377
You can always

284
00:15:56,417 --> 00:15:57,937
save a person's life
no matter how dire the situation is

285
00:15:57,937 --> 00:15:59,377
as long as you will it, huh?

286
00:16:00,297 --> 00:16:02,177
Tou Tou, did you get that?

287
00:16:02,817 --> 00:16:04,177
Mr Li is teasing me.

288
00:16:07,417 --> 00:16:08,297
Mr Li,

289
00:16:08,617 --> 00:16:10,297
he has been in that state
for a long time.

290
00:16:10,737 --> 00:16:13,817
It's all thanks to the care
of the Western doctors.

291
00:16:13,817 --> 00:16:15,377
We dare not claim credit for it.

292
00:16:15,977 --> 00:16:18,177
I'm just stating facts.

293
00:16:18,656 --> 00:16:19,617
Both Western and Chinese medicine
are working in tandem here.

294
00:16:20,417 --> 00:16:22,297
We Western doctors
can't really do anything

295
00:16:22,297 --> 00:16:24,057
after performing surgeries.

296
00:16:24,297 --> 00:16:26,656
It's all thanks to your great student.

297
00:16:27,417 --> 00:16:29,617
Faith will move mountains indeed.

298
00:16:29,937 --> 00:16:31,497
It's no wonder you think
so highly of her.

299
00:16:31,984 --> 00:16:32,776
Thank you, Dr Li.

300
00:16:32,817 --> 00:16:34,377
May I bring Master inside now?

301
00:16:34,377 --> 00:16:35,497
-Sure.
-Let's go.

302
00:16:35,497 --> 00:16:36,656
But wait a moment.

303
00:16:36,656 --> 00:16:38,576
I already instructed the nurse

304
00:16:38,576 --> 00:16:40,977
to transfer Mr Wu
to the special care unit.

305
00:16:41,057 --> 00:16:41,977
The conditions over there

306
00:16:41,977 --> 00:16:43,417
are better than the ICU.

307
00:16:43,737 --> 00:16:44,776
You guys can visit him there.

308
00:16:45,057 --> 00:16:45,937
Okay.

309
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:47,234
Thank you.

Shan Dao.

313
00:16:58,977 --> 00:16:59,977
Wu!

314
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:02,377
Shan Dao!

315
00:17:02,377 --> 00:17:03,191
Wake up.

316
00:17:03,216 --> 00:17:04,216
Open your eyes and take a look!

317
00:17:04,216 --> 00:17:05,737
Look at all the people
who are here to visit you.

318
00:17:06,062 --> 00:17:07,221
Over here.

319
00:17:11,177 --> 00:17:12,617
This is Mum.

320
00:17:12,617 --> 00:17:13,617
Shan Dao.

321
00:17:14,898 --> 00:17:15,713
Ren.

322
00:17:15,817 --> 00:17:17,297
Xin Zheng is here to see you too.

323
00:17:17,377 --> 00:17:18,250
Look.

324
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:21,367
And this girl.

325
00:17:21,977 --> 00:17:23,336
This is Sun Tou Tou.

326
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:25,497
She's been taking care of you
all the time.

327
00:17:26,057 --> 00:17:27,456
She's a great girl.

328
00:17:28,377 --> 00:17:29,857
Li Quan, come here.

329
00:17:29,857 --> 00:17:31,977
Shan Dao, this is your student, Li Quan.

330
00:17:32,977 --> 00:17:33,844
Look at him.

331
00:17:34,297 --> 00:17:35,096
Mr Wu.

332
00:17:38,297 --> 00:17:39,297
You recognised him, right?

333
00:17:39,857 --> 00:17:41,057
Calm down.

334
00:17:41,617 --> 00:17:42,857
Li Quan is a good boy too.

335
00:17:42,977 --> 00:17:44,257
He visited you every day.

336
00:17:45,417 --> 00:17:46,297
Alright.

337
00:17:48,857 --> 00:17:49,742
Calm down.

(Jiangzhou People's Hospital)

339
00:18:03,177 --> 00:18:04,096
Hello?

340
00:18:04,297 --> 00:18:05,148
(Hello.)

341
00:18:05,177 --> 00:18:06,536
I'm Tou Tou's boyfriend.

342
00:18:06,536 --> 00:18:07,497
I'm looking for Tou Tou.

343
00:18:08,417 --> 00:18:09,617
Tou Tou's boyfriend?

344
00:18:09,977 --> 00:18:11,656
Yes. It's like this.

345
00:18:11,656 --> 00:18:13,016
I brought her some things.

346
00:18:13,057 --> 00:18:14,617
And, I'm not allowed to
deliver them upstairs.

347
00:18:14,977 --> 00:18:16,336
Tell her to come down and take them.

348
00:18:17,057 --> 00:18:17,953
(Okay.)

349
00:18:18,417 --> 00:18:19,737
-Thank you.
-(You're welcome.)

350
00:18:21,937 --> 00:18:24,417
Tou Tou's boyfriend
is truly nice to her.

351
00:18:24,417 --> 00:18:25,312
Yeah.

352
00:18:25,377 --> 00:18:26,297
I said she must've saved the world

353
00:18:26,297 --> 00:18:27,536
in her past life.

354
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:29,937
She said her boyfriend was plain

355
00:18:29,977 --> 00:18:30,898
and ordinary.

356
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:32,057
Tell her then.

357
00:18:32,057 --> 00:18:33,016
I'll heat our food.

358
00:18:33,057 --> 00:18:33,890
Okay.

359
00:18:47,897 --> 00:18:48,765
Tou Tou,

360
00:18:50,377 --> 00:18:52,017
your "ordinary" boyfriend
is waiting for you downstairs.

361
00:18:52,474 --> 00:18:53,453
Wait.

362
00:18:54,137 --> 00:18:55,897
I thought he just left?
Why has he returned?

363
00:18:56,657 --> 00:18:58,137
Go now. He must've brought

364
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,257
something good for you.

365
00:18:59,377 --> 00:19:00,336
Alright, I got it.

366
00:19:00,377 --> 00:19:01,537
-Thank you.
-Don't mention it.

367
00:19:18,537 --> 00:19:19,737
"Ordinary", huh?

368
00:19:20,296 --> 00:19:21,537
-Nurse.
-Coming.

00:20:15,977 --> 00:20:17,056
That Mr Wang.

370
00:20:17,173 --> 00:20:17,973

He wants to come back here.

372
00:20:19,857 --> 00:20:21,537
He had been hospitalised for some time.

373
00:20:22,176 --> 00:20:23,017
Goodness.

374
00:20:23,017 --> 00:20:24,176
I guess he's already used to it.

375
00:20:24,216 --> 00:20:25,617
Alright, you may go inside.

376
00:20:39,617 --> 00:20:41,017
Wait. Please make way.

377
00:20:41,137 --> 00:20:42,101
Tou Tou.

378
00:21:22,777 --> 00:21:24,515
Hello, Tian Zhen.
Did you come to the hospital?

379
00:21:25,137 --> 00:21:25,936
You didn't?

380
00:21:26,977 --> 00:21:27,897
Alright, I got it.

381
00:22:13,296 --> 00:22:14,211
Get up!

382
00:22:16,777 --> 00:22:17,633
What are you doing?

383
00:22:19,377 --> 00:22:20,377
I did nothing.

384
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:21,764
Go away.

385
00:22:21,897 --> 00:22:22,977
I'm wiping the sweat off
my teacher's face.

386
00:22:23,137 --> 00:22:23,976
Stop lying!

387
00:22:24,497 --> 00:22:25,422
Zhao Li Quan,

388
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:27,737
I can do all of these myself.
Stay out of this.

389
00:22:27,737 --> 00:22:28,657
Leave immediately.

390
00:22:29,017 --> 00:22:29,857
Can you even do it?

391
00:22:30,857 --> 00:22:31,711
Where were you just now?

392
00:22:32,296 --> 00:22:33,816
Didn't you see that my teacher
was sweating profusely?

393
00:22:34,377 --> 00:22:35,537
You can do all of these?

394
00:22:36,137 --> 00:22:37,377
I thought you were supposed
to stand guard over him?

395
00:22:40,497 --> 00:22:41,497
So, it was you, huh?

396
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:43,336
What are you saying?

397
00:22:44,137 --> 00:22:46,017
Tou Tou, what are you saying? I have
no idea what you're talking about.

398
00:22:46,017 --> 00:22:47,056
As for what you were up to,

399
00:22:47,979 --> 00:22:49,056
the truth will be revealed

400
00:22:49,056 --> 00:22:50,416
when I retrieve
the surveillance footage.

401
00:22:51,497 --> 00:22:52,367
Now,

402
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:54,456
leave the room immediately.

403
00:22:56,377 --> 00:22:57,377
You can go ahead.

404
00:22:58,017 --> 00:22:59,897
Even so, you can only find footage
of you fooling around

405
00:22:59,897 --> 00:23:01,257
with those nurses out there.

406
00:23:01,977 --> 00:23:02,836
Go ahead.

407
00:23:03,137 --> 00:23:04,857
Tou Tou, what's the matter?

408
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:07,096
The alarm by the nurse's station
was rung just now.

409
00:23:07,137 --> 00:23:08,176
Did something happen?

410
00:23:08,657 --> 00:23:09,617
Everything's normal.

411
00:24:48,377 --> 00:24:49,737
I heard from Li Quan

412
00:24:49,737 --> 00:24:51,537
that Professor Wu's condition
should be taking a turn for the better.

413
00:24:51,537 --> 00:24:52,537
This is great.

414
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:53,816
-Wait.
-Tou Tou.

415
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,748
Tou Tou.

416
00:24:58,657 --> 00:25:00,777
How's Mr Wu doing today?
Can he recognise people now?

417
00:25:00,777 --> 00:25:02,296
He can speak now, right?

418
00:25:02,296 --> 00:25:03,497
I heard that they were injecting

419
00:25:03,537 --> 00:25:04,737
the medicine into his stomach.

420
00:25:04,737 --> 00:25:06,377
What prescription did Mr Ren give him?

421
00:25:06,617 --> 00:25:08,257
Cerebral haemorrhage
is just like a flood.

422
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:10,816
It'll flood and blur the boundaries
between the human brain.

423
00:25:10,977 --> 00:25:13,176
Many people will either
experience amnesia

424
00:25:13,176 --> 00:25:14,296
or be incoherent after they wake up.

425
00:25:14,897 --> 00:25:16,377
So, how exactly is
Mr Wu doing right now?

426
00:25:16,377 --> 00:25:18,296
Wait, did you guys
agree to come together?

427
00:25:18,296 --> 00:25:19,857
What's with all the people here?

428
00:25:19,857 --> 00:25:21,017
And, it's not like you guys
don't know this.

429
00:25:21,257 --> 00:25:23,137
The special care unit can only
accommodate a few visitors at a time.

430
00:25:23,137 --> 00:25:24,576
Li Quan told us to come here.

431
00:25:24,897 --> 00:25:25,897
He said he visited him yesterday

432
00:25:25,897 --> 00:25:27,056
and that Professor Wu
was doing much better.

433
00:25:27,657 --> 00:25:29,777
That's why we came here to visit him.

434
00:25:30,137 --> 00:25:32,017
-Yeah.
-Li Quan told us to come.

435
00:25:33,137 --> 00:25:34,816
It's like this. It's too crowded here.

436
00:25:34,857 --> 00:25:36,137
I suggest you guys head back first.

437
00:25:36,137 --> 00:25:37,897
We can arrange for visits by day.

438
00:25:38,017 --> 00:25:39,737
You guys can come by then.

439
00:25:39,977 --> 00:25:41,137
Go now. Stop messing around.

440
00:25:41,137 --> 00:25:41,936
Tou Tou.

441
00:25:44,657 --> 00:25:45,617
Tou Tou, how is it?

442
00:25:46,416 --> 00:25:47,257
What's going on?

443
00:25:48,377 --> 00:25:50,377
What's with all these people here?

444
00:25:50,377 --> 00:25:52,017
We're here to visit Professor Wu.

445
00:25:54,497 --> 00:25:55,375
Thank you.

446
00:25:56,377 --> 00:25:58,056
I'll thank you guys
on Professor Wu's behalf.

447
00:25:59,537 --> 00:26:00,492
Tou Tou,

448
00:26:00,657 --> 00:26:02,537
they'll just visit him for a minute.

449
00:26:02,537 --> 00:26:03,497
It should be fine, right?

450
00:26:03,537 --> 00:26:05,257
Why did you call everyone here?

451
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,815
Why did I call them here?

452
00:26:06,897 --> 00:26:08,056
Mr Wu is awake.

453
00:26:08,777 --> 00:26:09,617
As his students,

454
00:26:09,617 --> 00:26:10,977
shouldn't we visit him?

455
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:12,984
You guys should.

456
00:26:14,537 --> 00:26:15,456
Everyone can visit him

457
00:26:16,137 --> 00:26:16,976
except for you.

458
00:26:17,897 --> 00:26:18,816
Mind your manners.

459
00:26:19,537 --> 00:26:20,977
Your senior aunt is still here.

460
00:26:21,137 --> 00:26:22,257
You don't get to make the call here.

461
00:26:22,377 --> 00:26:23,456
What's the matter?

462
00:26:23,657 --> 00:26:25,576
Is there a misunderstanding
between you two?

463
00:26:26,056 --> 00:26:26,906
Ms Shen,

464
00:26:27,176 --> 00:26:28,216
I'm not allowing him to enter

465
00:26:28,216 --> 00:26:29,537
for Senior Uncle's sake.

466
00:26:29,857 --> 00:26:31,096
You trust me, right?

467
00:26:32,377 --> 00:26:33,258
What do you mean?

468
00:26:33,849 --> 00:26:34,797
Senior Aunt,

469
00:26:36,657 --> 00:26:37,537
you had no idea.

470
00:26:37,777 --> 00:26:38,977
Tou Tou couldn't bear the sight of me.

471
00:26:39,897 --> 00:26:40,765
This...

472
00:26:41,696 --> 00:26:42,576
Everyone knows this.

473
00:26:43,137 --> 00:26:45,296
Tou Tou is the leader of the pack.

474
00:26:46,137 --> 00:26:48,216
I've pleaded with her several times

475
00:26:48,257 --> 00:26:50,897
so that I could take her shift
and take care of Mr Wu.

476
00:26:51,696 --> 00:26:54,257
She didn't agree to it. It was as if
I was out to steal her credit.

477
00:26:54,257 --> 00:26:55,617
-How could that be?
-But you should know

478
00:26:55,617 --> 00:26:57,056
that I'm not that kind of person.

479
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:59,137
Tou Tou can claim
all the credit she wants.

480
00:26:59,137 --> 00:27:00,023
Zhao Li Quan.

481
00:27:01,816 --> 00:27:04,017
Master told me to stand guard
over the door.

482
00:27:04,137 --> 00:27:05,257
That means I have to do it.

483
00:27:05,737 --> 00:27:07,216
I don't care what you say.

484
00:27:07,657 --> 00:27:08,657
I won't allow you to enter.

485
00:27:09,897 --> 00:27:11,977
Tou Tou, everyone wants to visit Mr Wu.

486
00:27:12,056 --> 00:27:13,696
What about this? We can line up
and enter the room one by one,

487
00:27:13,696 --> 00:27:14,492
okay?

488
00:27:14,657 --> 00:27:16,537
-Yeah.
-We can line up.

489
00:27:16,537 --> 00:27:17,453
Sure.

490
00:27:17,657 --> 00:27:18,897
You guys can enter the room one by one.

491
00:27:18,897 --> 00:27:20,296
But please be silent.

492
00:27:20,296 --> 00:27:21,696
And, Ms Shen

493
00:27:21,696 --> 00:27:22,936
and Peng Shi Yan will
enter the room first.

494
00:27:22,936 --> 00:27:24,456
Once Ms Shen and Peng Shi Yan are out,

495
00:27:24,657 --> 00:27:25,777
the others can take turns
to go inside, okay?

496
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:26,777
Okay.

497
00:27:27,056 --> 00:27:28,497
-Let's go.
-Senior Aunt.

498
00:27:29,816 --> 00:27:31,617
You should let Li Quan visit him too.

499
00:27:31,777 --> 00:27:32,656
You see...

500
00:27:32,897 --> 00:27:33,936
He's anxious.

501
00:27:33,936 --> 00:27:35,257
He picked me up early in the morning.

502
00:27:35,257 --> 00:27:36,416
-Senior Aunt, that's enough.
-He told me a lot.

503
00:27:36,416 --> 00:27:37,777
Li Quan is in no hurry.

504
00:27:37,777 --> 00:27:39,576
He already came here last night.

505
00:27:39,576 --> 00:27:41,176
We were lucky that Senior Uncle
was still alive.

506
00:27:41,416 --> 00:27:42,257
What do you mean by that?

507
00:27:42,296 --> 00:27:44,176
I'm sure you know that the best.

508
00:27:53,696 --> 00:27:55,737
Tou Tou, you're being offensive here.

509
00:27:56,936 --> 00:27:58,737
What do you mean by
we're lucky that he's still alive?

510
00:27:58,737 --> 00:28:01,137
What exactly is going on?

511
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:02,816
Tou Tou, didn't I say already?

512
00:28:03,137 --> 00:28:04,977
You can claim all the credit you want.

513
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:06,857
I won't steal them from you.

514
00:28:08,216 --> 00:28:10,617
Just let me visit him, okay?

515
00:28:11,336 --> 00:28:13,096
I'll bear the consequences
if anything happens.

516
00:28:14,257 --> 00:28:16,456
Does this count as surrendering to you?

517
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:18,977
Can I enter the ward now?

518
00:28:19,216 --> 00:28:20,017
Zhao Li Quan,

519
00:28:20,497 --> 00:28:21,897
can you stop pretending to be pitiful

520
00:28:21,936 --> 00:28:23,857
and make it as if I'm bullying you?

521
00:28:24,056 --> 00:28:24,883
Fine.

522
00:28:25,377 --> 00:28:26,416
You want to go inside?

523
00:28:26,816 --> 00:28:28,737
Before that, explain yourself

524
00:28:28,737 --> 00:28:29,537
to Ms Shen

525
00:28:29,576 --> 00:28:30,456
and the others.

526
00:28:31,456 --> 00:28:32,497
Why did you sneak into

527
00:28:32,497 --> 00:28:34,056
his ward last night?

528
00:28:34,336 --> 00:28:35,816
Why did the alarm ring

529
00:28:35,857 --> 00:28:37,056
when you approached Senior Uncle?

530
00:28:38,336 --> 00:28:39,296
Fine. I'll explain myself.

531
00:28:41,377 --> 00:28:42,617
Everyone, listen.

532
00:28:43,936 --> 00:28:44,977
I came here last night

533
00:28:45,977 --> 00:28:47,737
just to take a look at Mr Wu.

534
00:28:49,216 --> 00:28:50,172
Just one look.

535
00:28:52,456 --> 00:28:53,320
But Tou Tou didn't allow me to.

536
00:28:56,054 --> 00:28:58,336
Tou Tou, you keep going against me.

537
00:28:58,336 --> 00:28:59,977
You think I have no idea
what you're up to?

538
00:29:00,737 --> 00:29:02,617
You're just afraid that
I'll expose you, right?

539
00:29:04,497 --> 00:29:05,936
But Sun Tou Tou, listen up.

540
00:29:06,576 --> 00:29:08,377
I'm not a scum like that.

541
00:29:08,936 --> 00:29:10,377
Even if I do know your secret,

542
00:29:10,696 --> 00:29:12,096
I won't expose you.

543
00:29:12,336 --> 00:29:13,497
What secret do I have?

544
00:29:14,456 --> 00:29:16,336
What secret is there for you to expose?

545
00:29:16,857 --> 00:29:17,734
Zhao Li Quan,

546
00:29:18,456 --> 00:29:21,056
I'm an honest and upright person.

547
00:29:21,336 --> 00:29:23,056
There's nothing for me to be afraid of.

548
00:29:23,137 --> 00:29:25,617
Today, I represent Master
and the acupuncture sect.

549
00:29:25,617 --> 00:29:27,377
I have to defend this door at all costs.

550
00:29:28,336 --> 00:29:29,195
But you?

551
00:29:29,296 --> 00:29:31,137
Although I don't know what you're up to,

552
00:29:31,857 --> 00:29:34,336
I know Senior Uncle's accident
is related to you somehow.

553
00:29:35,257 --> 00:29:36,377
But I'm in no hurry.

554
00:29:37,216 --> 00:29:38,296
You shouldn't be impatient too.

555
00:29:38,456 --> 00:29:39,777
Once Senior Uncle wakes up,

556
00:29:39,977 --> 00:29:41,096
everything

557
00:29:42,017 --> 00:29:43,257
will come to light.

558
00:29:45,977 --> 00:29:46,890
Let's go.

559
00:29:47,137 --> 00:29:49,017
Who do you think you are?

560
00:29:50,617 --> 00:29:52,816
You represent Mr Ren
and the acupuncture sect?

561
00:29:53,257 --> 00:29:54,777
Stop pretending to be the successor.

562
00:29:55,617 --> 00:29:57,696
I didn't expose you
on account of Mr Ren.

563
00:29:57,696 --> 00:29:59,176
I want to retain my mentor's dignity.

564
00:30:01,096 --> 00:30:01,936
You don't understand?

565
00:30:02,576 --> 00:30:03,857
You're a fake.

566
00:30:04,576 --> 00:30:05,657
You're an impostor.

567
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:08,377
Where are your parents?

568
00:30:08,777 --> 00:30:09,617
You have no idea.

569
00:30:10,336 --> 00:30:11,416
You're not the true successor

570
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:13,336
of the Jiang family's acupuncture sect.

571
00:30:13,977 --> 00:30:15,936
You're just a wild girl.

572
00:30:16,056 --> 00:30:17,096
You're a wild child!

573
00:30:17,096 --> 00:30:17,977
Zhao Li Quan!

574
00:30:18,816 --> 00:30:19,857
What did you say just now?

575
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:29,476
What did I say?

576
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:33,257
You're unfit to stay here.

577
00:31:07,696 --> 00:31:08,857
You're a crook.

578
00:31:10,096 --> 00:31:11,576
You forged all of these.

579
00:31:12,296 --> 00:31:13,696
My grandmother, Granny Zeng,

580
00:31:14,257 --> 00:31:15,857
is the founder of the Jiang family's
acupuncture sect.

581
00:31:15,857 --> 00:31:18,336
My mother died in an effort
to support the flood relief movement.

582
00:31:18,336 --> 00:31:19,737
I'm the successor of the sect.

583
00:31:19,737 --> 00:31:21,377
That's what Master told me.

584
00:31:22,857 --> 00:31:24,936
Zhao Li Quan, where did you get
all of these documents?

585
00:31:28,137 --> 00:31:29,257
Successor of the sect?

586
00:31:31,737 --> 00:31:32,648
Listen.

587
00:31:34,857 --> 00:31:38,816
Mr Wu gave them to me personally.

588
00:31:38,977 --> 00:31:41,456
Mr Wu even told me

589
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:43,857
about your true identity as an impostor.

590
00:31:44,216 --> 00:31:45,195
Tian Zhen.

591
00:31:46,216 --> 00:31:48,176
Maybe your father was an accomplice too.

592
00:31:48,377 --> 00:31:49,257
Now, you guys know

593
00:31:49,257 --> 00:31:50,696
why Tou Tou doesn't want

594
00:31:50,696 --> 00:31:52,336
to let me visit Mr Wu.

595
00:31:52,857 --> 00:31:54,537
She's afraid that Mr Wu

596
00:31:55,096 --> 00:31:56,296
might expose her

597
00:31:56,336 --> 00:31:58,816
once he recovers.

598
00:31:58,977 --> 00:31:59,857
I'll kill you!

599
00:32:00,056 --> 00:32:00,914
Tou Tou!

600
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:08,096
I'll kill you!

601
00:32:08,257 --> 00:32:09,180
Listen!

602
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:10,456
I saw you when you snuck into

603
00:32:10,456 --> 00:32:11,576
the ward last night!

604
00:32:11,816 --> 00:32:13,576
He made all of these false documents

605
00:32:13,576 --> 00:32:14,977
because I caught him red-handed!

606
00:32:15,216 --> 00:32:17,696
All of these are false!
None of them is true!

607
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:20,137
If any of my words are false,

608
00:32:20,336 --> 00:32:21,497
may thunder strike me!

609
00:32:21,696 --> 00:32:23,137
I'm not lying!

610
00:32:23,137 --> 00:32:24,015
Tou Tou.

611
00:32:24,216 --> 00:32:25,137
You're an impostor.

612
00:32:26,216 --> 00:32:27,377
You're a wild child.

613
00:32:27,377 --> 00:32:28,737
You're unfit to stand here.

614
00:32:28,737 --> 00:32:29,696
She's fit!

615
00:32:37,977 --> 00:32:38,890
Enough.

616
00:32:40,096 --> 00:32:41,497
Stop crying.

617
00:32:52,456 --> 00:32:53,617
Sun Tou Tou isn't

618
00:32:53,617 --> 00:32:55,096
the successor of the Jiang family's
acupuncture sect.

619
00:32:57,497 --> 00:32:58,816
However, no one here

620
00:32:58,816 --> 00:33:00,857
is worthy enough to stand here
except for her.

621
00:33:04,456 --> 00:33:05,816
It's because she's my daughter.

622
00:33:16,056 --> 00:33:18,216
Say that again?

623
00:33:34,857 --> 00:33:35,816
She's my daughter.

624
00:33:46,056 --> 00:33:47,137
Mr Ren,

625
00:33:49,096 --> 00:33:50,857
I suggest you think twice

626
00:33:52,056 --> 00:33:53,456
before saying anything!

627
00:34:38,497 --> 00:34:39,977
Say, do you think

628
00:34:41,257 --> 00:34:42,657
something will happen to Lan?

629
00:34:44,696 --> 00:34:47,056
No one expected this to happen.

630
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:48,897
How could that be true?

631
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:51,216
How could Tou Tou be

632
00:34:51,216 --> 00:34:52,416
Ren's illegitimate daughter?

633
00:34:52,456 --> 00:34:54,336
Ren isn't that kind of person.

634
00:34:55,216 --> 00:34:58,377
However, if it's true,

635
00:34:58,816 --> 00:35:01,497
since she's younger than Tian Zhen,

636
00:35:01,497 --> 00:35:02,737
that means he had her
after marrying Lan.

637
00:35:05,609 --> 00:35:06,456
That's impossible.

638
00:35:06,456 --> 00:35:07,816
What should we do now?

639
00:35:08,456 --> 00:35:09,936
If Shan Dao wasn't unconscious,

640
00:35:09,936 --> 00:35:12,056
he could've explained the situation
and resolved any tension.

641
00:35:12,576 --> 00:35:13,977
But look at him now.

642
00:35:18,936 --> 00:35:21,576
Should I tell Master and Madam about it?

643
00:35:21,857 --> 00:35:23,257
You mustn't be a busybody.

644
00:35:24,137 --> 00:35:25,336
That's not it.

645
00:35:25,336 --> 00:35:26,336
This is a huge deal.

646
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:27,377
If it's true,

647
00:35:27,377 --> 00:35:28,296
there's no way to hide it.

648
00:35:28,296 --> 00:35:29,336
It'll be revealed eventually.

649
00:35:29,336 --> 00:35:31,176
The person telling them
is important too.

650
00:35:37,416 --> 00:35:38,977
I've been friends with Lan
for many years.

651
00:35:38,977 --> 00:35:40,096
I know her well.

652
00:35:40,137 --> 00:35:41,897
She'll never tell her parents
about this.

653
00:35:43,696 --> 00:35:45,456
However, if this is true,

654
00:35:46,737 --> 00:35:48,777
their family might be affected.

655
00:35:50,216 --> 00:35:51,097
Judging from Lan's personality,

656
00:35:51,136 --> 00:35:52,896
she'll only tell her parents

657
00:35:52,896 --> 00:35:54,017
after everything is done.

658
00:35:54,057 --> 00:35:55,257
If that's the case,

659
00:35:55,257 --> 00:35:56,136
everything will be too late.

660
00:35:56,176 --> 00:35:57,297
It'll be a foregone conclusion by then.

661
00:35:58,577 --> 00:35:59,577
Shen Xin,

662
00:35:59,656 --> 00:36:01,896
we haven't settled
our family affair yet.

663
00:36:02,656 --> 00:36:04,297
Now, you want to poke into
other people's business?

664
00:36:10,497 --> 00:36:12,416
Shan Dao is lying unconscious.

665
00:36:13,097 --> 00:36:14,416
I feel terrible.

666
00:36:16,497 --> 00:36:19,656
However, there's still hope
for his recovery.

667
00:36:21,497 --> 00:36:22,896
I'm just thinking

668
00:36:24,376 --> 00:36:25,656
about what I would do

669
00:36:26,896 --> 00:36:28,376
if I encountered the same thing as Lan.

670
00:36:30,376 --> 00:36:31,176
It's heartbreaking.

671
00:36:31,176 --> 00:36:32,577
I don't know what I'll do.

672
00:36:33,896 --> 00:36:35,337
There are always ordeals to overcome.

673
00:36:35,896 --> 00:36:38,057
We have to overcome them one by one.

674
00:36:43,497 --> 00:36:44,398
Mum,

675
00:36:45,456 --> 00:36:46,856
I think we should help them

676
00:36:46,896 --> 00:36:47,936
when we can.

677
00:36:48,416 --> 00:36:51,176
Mr Song is a wise man.

678
00:36:51,176 --> 00:36:52,896
This is a crucial moment.

679
00:36:52,896 --> 00:36:54,977
We need him to take a hold
of the situation.

680
00:36:56,497 --> 00:36:59,337
I think I should tell him about it.

681
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:09,176
If so, please look after him.

682
00:37:09,176 --> 00:37:10,097
Alright. Go now.

683
00:37:11,936 --> 00:37:13,537
Call me if anything happens.

684
00:37:19,057 --> 00:37:21,936
Shan Dao, if only you were awake.

685
00:37:23,257 --> 00:37:26,176
You could've resolved everything.

686
00:37:37,497 --> 00:37:39,456
A good lady must obey.

687
00:37:40,616 --> 00:37:42,257
Do you know how old we are?

688
00:37:42,257 --> 00:37:44,616
How could you bear to
leave us standing here

689
00:37:44,656 --> 00:37:45,856
when the breeze is chilling?

690
00:37:48,097 --> 00:37:49,257
Follow us home.

691
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:50,617
Come.

692
00:37:55,337 --> 00:37:56,234
Look.

693
00:37:56,896 --> 00:37:57,856
She doesn't listen to me.

694
00:37:58,577 --> 00:37:59,977
Persuade her.

695
00:38:00,616 --> 00:38:03,176
I won't. I'm a woman too.

696
00:38:03,176 --> 00:38:04,696
I understand a woman's heart.

697
00:38:05,896 --> 00:38:09,057
Once it's broken,
it can never be repaired.

698
00:38:09,057 --> 00:38:11,057
Stop causing trouble.

699
00:38:11,696 --> 00:38:13,337
Don't you think
it's troublesome enough already?

700
00:38:14,337 --> 00:38:16,896
Say something nice.
Don't say something disheartening.

701
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,280
By the way,

702
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:21,936
Winter Solstice is nearing.

703
00:38:21,936 --> 00:38:22,977
We haven't brewed

704
00:38:23,577 --> 00:38:25,416
the Winter Solstice health soup yet.

705
00:38:26,456 --> 00:38:27,936
Look at the situation we're in.

706
00:38:28,497 --> 00:38:30,097
You're still talking about soup?

707
00:38:31,497 --> 00:38:32,578
In life,

708
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,696
there are many ordeals
we have to overcome,

709
00:38:35,176 --> 00:38:38,696
and we have to overcome them one by one.

710
00:38:39,577 --> 00:38:43,136
This has nothing to do with one's mood.

711
00:38:43,337 --> 00:38:44,257
Let's take Sima Qian as an example.

712
00:38:45,257 --> 00:38:47,017
Even if he was tortured,

713
00:38:47,057 --> 00:38:48,896
he still had to celebrate
the Qingming Festival,

714
00:38:48,896 --> 00:38:51,057
the Chongyang Festival,
and Winter Solstice too.

715
00:38:53,337 --> 00:38:56,097
If not, there would be no Shi Ji.

716
00:38:56,656 --> 00:38:59,257
It doesn't matter
if we skip a bowl of soup.

717
00:38:59,896 --> 00:39:02,376
If so, it doesn't matter
if we have an extra child.

718
00:39:06,616 --> 00:39:09,696
I just want to lighten up the mood.

719
00:39:11,497 --> 00:39:12,616
Go back.

720
00:39:13,337 --> 00:39:15,097
Go and prepare the prescriptions
with Xin Zheng.

721
00:39:15,416 --> 00:39:16,696
I'll keep our daughter company.

722
00:39:22,456 --> 00:39:24,136
A good lady must obey, okay?

723
00:40:11,936 --> 00:40:12,898
Master.

724
00:40:16,376 --> 00:40:18,616
You still need to do the things
you're supposed to.

725
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:19,856
Do you know what day it is?

726
00:40:20,737 --> 00:40:23,136
Have you started brewing
the Winter Solstice Soup?

727
00:40:26,896 --> 00:40:27,977
I'll brew it right now.

728
00:40:30,337 --> 00:40:32,176
Master, I...

729
00:40:32,656 --> 00:40:33,616
I trust you.

730
00:40:36,176 --> 00:40:37,537
I never doubted you

731
00:40:38,376 --> 00:40:39,977
when I handed over my position

732
00:40:41,176 --> 00:40:43,376
and my daughter to you.

733
00:40:44,097 --> 00:40:45,337
It'll be the same in the future.

734
00:40:48,057 --> 00:40:49,456
That is all.

735
00:40:55,977 --> 00:40:56,777
Thank you, Master.

736
00:41:29,337 --> 00:41:30,817
Mum, you should head back too.

737
00:41:32,376 --> 00:41:33,376
No, I won't.

738
00:41:34,136 --> 00:41:35,097
Look at the state you're in.

739
00:41:35,257 --> 00:41:36,416
How could I go back?

740
00:41:46,936 --> 00:41:47,789
Mum.

741
00:41:50,497 --> 00:41:51,305
I...

742
00:41:51,656 --> 00:41:53,376
I just don't understand him.

743
00:41:55,656 --> 00:41:57,616
Why is he doing this to me?

744
00:42:03,097 --> 00:42:04,000
Actually,

745
00:42:06,416 --> 00:42:07,896
I'm not angry at all.

746
00:42:10,577 --> 00:42:11,656
I just feel

747
00:42:13,057 --> 00:42:14,176
disappointed.

748
00:42:16,456 --> 00:42:17,616
Do you know this? When I...

749
00:42:20,817 --> 00:42:22,136
When I looked at him,

750
00:42:22,136 --> 00:42:23,577
(he avoided my eyes.)

751
00:42:23,577 --> 00:42:24,737
(At that time, I felt...)

752
00:42:26,656 --> 00:42:28,537
I suddenly felt like

753
00:42:29,257 --> 00:42:31,216
we were strangers.

754
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,031
