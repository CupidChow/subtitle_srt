1
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,600
Today, we have another happy occasion.

2
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,520
I met an old patient of mine,

3
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,280
which is Madam Jiang Li.

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,720
So, I would like
to invite Madam Jiang Li

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,560
to give us the opening speech.

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,840
Let's give her a round of applause.

7
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,240
First of all,

8
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,400
I'd like to thank

9
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:33,960
Professor Ren

10
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,760
for giving me a second chance at life.

11
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,200
Before this,

12
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,960
I was diagnosed with late-stage cancer.

13
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,080
Professor Ren enlightened me.

14
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,480
My illness was healed
miraculously and completely!

15
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,680
Now, I am

16
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,960
in the best time

17
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,800
of my life.

18
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,400
Kids,

19
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,680
you must study hard.

20
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,040
Preserve and pass on

21
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,480
the precious knowledge

22
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,760
of TCM.

23
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,437
Madam Jiang, you mustn't
say something like that.

24
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,160
You might give others the wrong idea.

25
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,120
It's not scientific.

26
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,480
How is it not scientific?

27
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,597
I don't care
whether it's scientific or not.

28
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,757
Whoever saved my life

29
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,160
is a good doctor.

30
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,760
Thank you, Madam Jiang.

31
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,240
Thank you. Thank you.

32
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,197
Some of you may not know this.

33
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,000
The student who brought that up
just now is Peng Shi Yan.

34
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,040
He is a doctor of Western medicine.

35
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,200
He's also the class leader
of our TCM class.

36
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,840
He's right.

37
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,600
TCM is unscientific,

38
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,320
because it is a field of study.

39
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,397
I don't know if you've read
this book before, Peng.

40
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:53,120
There is a philosopher of science
named Karl Popper.

41
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,960
He wrote a book called

42
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,880
"Objective Knowledge",

43
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,760
which some of you
may have read it before.

44
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,120
In this book, he discusses

45
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,880
the concept of three worlds

46
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,720
and their interrelations.

47
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,480
He believes

48
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,400
that falsifiability

49
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,720
is what defines science.

50
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,640
You should know that

51
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,760
there were the geocentric model

52
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,160
and the heliocentric model,

53
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,160
which were considered
scientific back then.

54
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,640
Science

55
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,597
is the process

56
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,600
that guides us step by step towards

57
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,880
understanding the truth.

58
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,600
It is measurable

59
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:34,840
and calculable.

60
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,400
However, have you ever wondered, Peng,

61
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,160
how music and painting

62
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,440
can be scientifically measured?

63
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,520
How do we quantify

64
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,760
the pain of a disease?

65
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,840
We have sent rockets into space,

66
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,000
but how do we fathom a woman's heart?

67
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,640
So our world

68
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,720
is divided into
many different dimensions.

69
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,000
There is the subjective

70
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,600
and the objective.

71
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,477
(Wu Yu)
We shouldn't treat

72
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,000
the subjective as the only reality,

73
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,520
nor should we take the objective

74
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,957
as the sole standard.

75
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,040
Just like how humans

76
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,917
are composed of two

77
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,440
or even three parts.

78
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,320
One part is the body,

79
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,640
which everyone is familiar with.

80
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Western medicine has made great progress

81
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,520
in understanding the body,

82
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,320
such as in the fields of data,

83
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,800
bacteria,

84
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,680
and imaging.

85
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,360
Their achievements are remarkable.

86
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,560
Besides the body,

87
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,320
we also have the mind.

88
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,400
When measuring a person's health,

89
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,880
we consider both the physical

90
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,320
and mental aspects.

91
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,560
The body should be strong and agile,

92
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,440
while the mind should be
stable and composed.

93
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,160
Apart from these two,

94
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,200
I believe there is another aspect.

95
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,760
The spirit.

96
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,920
The spirituality.

97
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,560
It means that our thoughts

98
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,000
should have higher aspirations.

99
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,240
You all heard what Madam Jiang
said just now.

100
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,560
From the physical aspect,

101
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,480
she was terminally ill.

102
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,760
Western medicine might not
have been able to treat her.

103
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,160
If it weren't for TCM,

104
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,000
she might have experienced

105
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,637
a painful death during the process

106
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,160
of being sentenced to death.

107
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,480
Fortunately, we have TCM.

108
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,957
I encouraged her
to pray to gods and deities.

109
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,840
Does it work?

110
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,037
I'm not going to discuss
about supernatural beings here.

111
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,280
I simply hoped that

112
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,280
in the final stage

113
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,960
of Madam Jiang's life,

114
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,560
she could find

115
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,400
a sense of connection with the universe,

116
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,720
with all living beings,

117
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,240
and ultimately with herself.

118
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,840
It's better than

119
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,440
living in agony.

120
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,560
After all, climbing mountains

121
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,880
and prostrating

122
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,880
are forms of physical activity.

123
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,760
-Right?
-Right.

124
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,880
They are better than lying down.

125
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,720
Because movement

126
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,280
generates Yang energy,

127
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,840
and Yang energy brings vitality.

128
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,640
Let's give a round of applause
to Madam Jiang.

129
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,120
So, according to the theories of TCM,

130
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,960
the power of the mind

131
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,000
is greater than that of the body.

132
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,800
When a person has a strong faith

133
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,240
and a strong will,

134
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,680
they can certainly overcome

135
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,840
the unbearable pain within the body.

136
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,320
Let me give you an example.

137
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:04,920
Peng,

138
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,840
say

139
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,840
there's a car outside,

140
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,280
and I'll give you 10,000 yuan

141
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,640
for you to lift it up.

142
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,360
Don't be silly.

143
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,720
I'm not that strong.

144
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,480
How about one million?

145
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,080
One million?

146
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,800
Then I'll give it a try.

147
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:23,960
Peng Shi Yan,

148
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,680
that's one million yuan.

149
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,840
If you can't lift it up,
I'm going to beat you up.

150
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,437
But even if I exert all my strength,

151
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,560
I can't do it.

152
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,640
Shi Yan,

153
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,680
what if it's your own child

154
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,320
under the car?

155
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,560
I can lift it up.

156
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,160
Mr Ren, I really can.

157
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,480
A mother can.

158
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,480
A mother really can.

159
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,720
You can

160
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,917
look it up online.

161
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,520
Many mothers can do it.

162
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,480
They can surpass your
understanding of human capabilities.

163
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,920
Everyone knows

164
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,120
that humans have potential.

165
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,400
We would sacrifice our lives

166
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,640
for our ideals,

167
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,840
for our beliefs.

168
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,560
We would sacrifice ourselves

169
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,480
to save others.

170
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,040
On this point,

171
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,520
from a scientific perspective,

172
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,240
this remains a mystery.

173
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,840
So, I believe...

174
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,480
I believe that
Western medicine is a skill.

175
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,920
It can be standardized

176
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,400
and replicated on a large scale.

177
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,040
But TCM is different.

178
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,160
I see TCM

179
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,360
as a personal cultivation,

180
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,720
as the Way.

181
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,920
That's why I established

182
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,160
the apprentice class.

183
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,080
By establishing the apprentice class,

184
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,720
by forming

185
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,840
a master-apprentice relationship,

186
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,040
I can find people

187
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,360
who resonate with me

188
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,317
on the same frequency.

189
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,440
Only in this way

190
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,160
can the Way of TCM

191
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,200
be truly passed down.

192
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,797
After establishing scholarships
for so many years,

193
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,037
this is the first time I've been
provided this kind of service.

194
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,960
Professor Wu,

195
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,000
your approach is indeed
different from Professor Ren's.

196
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,320
You've been hiding your light
under a bushel.

197
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,637
Oh, I can't compare to Xin Zheng.

198
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,160
He is the real expert.

199
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,077
He's surrounded by talented individuals.

200
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:49,960
My abilities

201
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,397
are limited,

202
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,600
but I can still help you

203
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,800
with the issue of overexertion
and muscle soreness.

204
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,397
I have some solutions for that.

205
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,277
Honestly,

206
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,880
the foot massage here is excellent.
You'll know once you try it.

207
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,800
Come now.

208
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,960
You need to experience
everything personally.

209
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,720
The feeling is different.

210
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,517
Hi, I'm masseur 030158.

211
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,637
It's my pleasure to serve you.

212
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,600
-Hi.
-Hi.

213
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,357
I'm masseur 030128.
I'm here to serve you.

214
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,720
-Come.
-Come.

215
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,320
Mr Wu.

216
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,320
What are you doing here?

217
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,720
The new apprentice class
starts today, right?

218
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,757
I have a guest with me now.

219
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,920
I'll join them later.

220
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,520
Mr Wu, do you know him?

221
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,320
Mr Zheng, allow me to introduce.

222
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,517
This is Zhao Li Quan,

223
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,437
a talented and outstanding student
from our University of TCM,

224
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,400
a top achiever.

225
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,520
Zhao, this is Mr Zheng,

226
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,597
who sponsors the scholarship
of our university.

227
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,200
He sponsored the scholarship
you received for your studies.

228
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,280
Thank you. Mr Zheng.

229
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,360
We have met before.

230
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,840
Was it during the scholarship
award ceremony at the school?

231
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,880
There was also another time when I
went to your estate for picking mugwort.

232
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,160
Oh, right.

233
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,600
I led the team that time.

234
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,760
Among all my students,
I especially enjoy taking him along.

235
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,160
Mr Zheng, let me tell you,

236
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,720
the young generation nowadays

237
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,037
is truly remarkable.

238
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,680
Take Zhao as an example,

239
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,400
he went from undergraduate
to master's degree.

240
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,080
He's different from other masseurs.

241
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,717
He truly applies what he learned

242
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,800
into practical experience.

243
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,080
That's why I specially
introduced him to you today

244
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,517
so that you can experience

245
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,160
what high-quality
medical service means.

246
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,877
That's great. I'm honoured

247
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,077
to experience it today.

248
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,400
I must give it a try.

249
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,520
What are you waiting for? Hurry up.

250
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,640
-Okay.
-Let him serve him.

251
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,400
Should I sit up?

252
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,400
Yes, Mr Zheng.

253
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,440
Here.

254
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,477
Is the temperature okay?

255
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,117
-Is the temperature okay?
-It's just right.

256
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,877
Do you prefer teabag

257
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,920
or salt?

258
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,080
Teabag.

259
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,000
Okay.

260
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:25,960
Mr Ren,

261
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,917
earlier, you mentioned
skill and the Way,

262
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,800
standardisation and non-standardisation,

263
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,197
rationality and sensibility,

264
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,520
subjectivity and objectivity.

265
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,360
Medicine is a progressing science.

266
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,960
Our understanding of human
is also constantly advancing.

267
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,640
However, TCM seems

268
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,360
to revolve around the same few books.

269
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,477
Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic,

270
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,717
Compendium of Materia Medica,
Treatise on Cold Damage Diseases.

271
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,280
Even the most recent classic

272
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,200
is nearly 500 years old, right?

273
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,840
Can we, as humans,

274
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,360
expect ourselves to be the same

275
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,840
as we were 500 years ago?

276
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,360
Okay, let's not talk about 500 years.

277
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,197
Even someone from the 1980s
were to travel to the present day,

278
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,760
they would probably starve to death.

279
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,197
Because they wouldn't know
how to use a smartphone.

280
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,197
They can't order food delivery
or even hail a ride.

281
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,077
So, why should we still
rely on prescriptions

282
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,560
from 1,000 or 2.000 years ago
in today's medical practice?

283
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,160
Isn't that a fantasy?

284
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,880
Peng, look,

285
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,400
you just mentioned that

286
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:14,840
TCM

287
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,280
hasn't changed in over 2,000 years.

288
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,557
So, let me ask you,

289
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,080
while technology has advanced,

290
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,840
have we as humans

291
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,000
changed in

292
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,080
these 2,000 years?

293
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,280
Of course.

294
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,717
Human lifespan

295
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,960
has significantly increased.

296
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,800
Our development of the brain and

297
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,597
our understanding
of genetic sequences

298
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,480
have surpassed
the realm of life and death.

299
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,000
Our control over

300
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,600
the Earth has also greatly increased.

301
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,400
I disagree, Mr Ren.

302
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,480
I don't consider it progress.

303
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,400
Originally, the Earth

304
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,200
was a perfect ecological closed loop.

305
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,757
Ever since humans

306
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,840
became the apex predators
in the food chain,

307
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,517
all the harm done is man-made

308
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,520
and is uncontrollable.

309
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,280
So, once humans gain control
over the Earth,

310
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,200
how can you control human desires

311
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,280
and prevent them

312
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,800
from harming other species?

313
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,520
Everything has its dual nature.

314
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,960
You can't acknowledge
only side A and deny side B.

315
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,640
In ancient times, people could observe

316
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,517
planets 270 light-years away with
the naked eye and draw them clearly,

317
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,997
but now, without wearing glasses,
we can't even see words clearly.

318
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,960
Would you say this is
progress or regression?

319
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,040
Smartphones have become an extension

320
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,200
of ourselves in our daily lives.

321
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,317
We can

322
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,200
hardly function

323
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,840
without our phones

324
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,520
when we leave the house.

325
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,280
Technology is constantly evolving.

326
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,837
However, there are certain things

327
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,480
that haven't changed,

328
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,080
whether it's 2,000 years ago

329
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,840
or 2,000 years from now,

330
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,520
and that is

331
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,040
human emotions.

332
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,200
2,000 years ago,

333
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,720
when our parents passed away,

334
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,840
we would cry.

335
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,720
2,000 years later,

336
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,640
just because we have phones,
it doesn't mean

337
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,400
we won't feel sad

338
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,720
when our parents pass away.

339
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,520
Teachers,

340
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,997
when I talk about reason,

341
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,157
you talk about emotions.

342
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,280
When I talk about emotions,
you talk about rules.

343
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,440
When I talk about rules,

344
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,637
you talk about human nature.

345
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,400
Can't we communicate
on the same platform?

346
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,760
Here's the thing.

347
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,520
We can't treat TCM and Western medicine

348
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,200
the same way

349
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,680
because these two disciplines

350
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,080
are inherently

351
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,040
different.

352
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,800
You can't force TCM
to be technologically advanced.

353
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,520
If you insist on asking me

354
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,720
which herb in my prescription
treats numbness

355
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,397
or which one treats bleeding,

356
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,877
I can't give you an answer.

357
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,517
That's your way of thinking.

358
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,800
I can only tell you

359
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,197
that a person is a holistic being,
and medicine is holistic too.

360
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,360
They naturally interact with each other.

361
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,040
I have great faith in Professor Ren

362
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,000
because over the years,

363
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,080
we have realised

364
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,920
that science can't solve all problems.

365
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,120
In the foreign metropolis where I live,

366
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,120
there are many TCM practitioners

367
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,160
and doctors specialising
in natural therapies.

368
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:19,720
What's most interesting
is the philosophy of the East,

369
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,920
including various forms of exercise.

370
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,880
Practices like yoga

371
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,680
are highly regarded by many of us.

372
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,517
Actually, everyone knows that

373
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,000
the concept of Tao involves
the interaction of Yin and Yang.

374
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,560
Technology has indeed progressed,

375
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,680
but in the grand scheme

376
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,840
of the universe,

377
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:48,560
its progress is only a tiny fraction.

378
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,440
We should not magnify it
to encompass everything.

379
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,680
Everyone is aware
of the harm to the body.

380
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,197
The Inner Classic

381
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,040
already explains this very clearly.

382
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,560
External pathogens include

383
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:03,680
wind, cold, heat,
dampness, dryness, and fire.

384
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:05,880
Internal pathogens

385
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,080
involve

386
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,080
excessive joy, anger, worry,
overthinking, fright, and sadness.

387
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,280
No matter how much progress we make,

388
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,640
these factors

389
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,440
remain unchanged.

390
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,400
Mr Ren,

391
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,800
you're mistaken again.

392
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,080
You see,

393
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,477
in ancient times, people often
suffered from hunger and cold,

394
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,480
but nowadays,

395
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,037
people are no longer
lacking food and warm clothing.

396
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,117
So why do conditions like

397
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,560
wind, cold, heat, dampness,
dryness, and fire still exist?

398
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,520
That's a very good point you've raised.

399
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,680
Have you noticed that

400
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,560
young people these days

401
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,520
wear very little clothing during winter?

402
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:43,920
They wear shorts,

403
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,080
use air conditioning,

404
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,360
and drink cold beverages.

405
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,320
Compared to the past,

406
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,320
they are exposed to much more coldness.

407
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,197
I don't understand

408
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,600
the dressing style

409
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,200
of young people nowadays.

410
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,280
During winter,

411
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,080
they expose their ankles

412
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,440
and wear pants

413
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,757
with holes all over.

414
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,477
I don't understand. Is that considered

415
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,800
beautiful or ugly?

416
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,317
In ancient times,

417
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,520
this would be described as
"dressed in rags".

418
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,600
I might not have a deep understanding

419
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,877
of the current technology
and fashion trends,

420
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,840
but I have observed one thing.

421
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,317
As long as smartphones exist,

422
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,357
Ms Dong's cervical massage business

423
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,880
will continue to thrive.

424
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,317
If more attractive ladies

425
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,717
and energetic young men

426
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,760
continue to wear clothes
with less fabric,

427
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,800
our infertility clinic

428
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,440
will continue to flourish.

429
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,960
There is a saying in
Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic.

430
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,717
"All pains, itches, and sores

431
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,880
are related to the heart."

432
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,197
You see,

433
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,000
these are diseases on the skin,

434
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,120
but in reality,

435
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,360
they are manifestations
of inner emotional tension.

436
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,160
The body and mind of a person

437
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,120
cannot be completely separated.

438
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,917
The other day,

439
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,040
I attended a lecture by
a Western medicine expert,

440
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,397
Professor Yang Xue Qin

441
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,160
from the Air Force General Hospital.

442
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,680
She mentioned that
many patients with psoriasis

443
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,200
actually exhibit

444
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,920
external manifestations
of their emotions.

445
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,880
This coincides

446
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,600
with the theories of TCM.

447
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,360
Therefore, I believe

448
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,880
that the relationship between
TCM and Western medicine

449
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,960
is not one of opposition,

450
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,000
but rather a quest for unity

451
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,200
within their differences.

452
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,597
Ms Song is right.

453
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,560
Let me give you another example.

454
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,720
In my office,

455
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,280
I have two pots of tomatoes.
You all have seen them.

456
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,720
When we weren't around,

457
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,800
they borne abundant fruits.

458
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,517
However, later on,

459
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,157
when we tried to transplant them

460
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,277
to a better environment

461
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,040
because they were growing so well,

462
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,880
they started to wither.

463
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,520
But when we let them be

464
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,800
and allowed them to grow,

465
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,400
they revived once again.

466
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,480
So, I believe that

467
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,080
in cases of emergencies,

468
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,440
such as cancer,

469
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,517
I am highly supportive

470
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,960
of surgical intervention.

471
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,920
If you don't perform surgery,
the illness

472
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,360
will be like

473
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,517
an out-of-control heavy truck

474
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,720
racing on a highway

475
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,960
without brakes.

476
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,600
It will run recklessly,

477
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,397
and the ultimate outcome

478
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,560
is destruction.

479
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,600
Therefore, we perform the surgery,

480
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,640
allowing the patient

481
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,640
to buy some time.

482
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,160
Afterwards,

483
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,760
we apply

484
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,960
a little external force

485
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,800
to assist the patient's

486
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,760
self-repair process.

487
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,400
Remember,

488
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,317
both TCM and Western
medicine practitioners

489
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,360
are not gods who cure diseases,

490
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,520
but rather people

491
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,960
who help patients
on their path to health.

492
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,240
Professor Ren,

493
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,877
I deeply resonated with
the meaning you just mentioned

494
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,240
about praying to the deities.

495
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,960
Do you remember the first time we met?

496
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,120
I was in such a state of despair.

497
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,560
I felt like I couldn't go on living.

498
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,397
You gave me an ancient prescription.

499
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,840
The search of the ingredients

500
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,560
has kept me going for a year.

501
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,200
I suddenly realised it just now.

502
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,157
Actually, when you asked me
to find 300-year-old tiles,

503
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,037
it was to give me

504
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,440
a buffer period.

505
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,397
So that I could calm down
from my grief and fear,

506
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,240
and then face a new life again,

507
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,240
right?

508
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,560
Thank you for
your thoughtful intentions.

509
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,760
Actually,

510
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,877
during my time

511
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,360
working at the medical centre,

512
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,477
I have met

513
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,960
all sorts of people.

514
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,157
Some appear physically healthy,

515
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,757
but they suffer from mental illness.

516
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:08,120
Some suffer from both physical
and mental illnesses.

517
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,157
As long as you are alive,

518
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,637
no one's life is perfect.

519
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,880
Everyone faces
their own difficulties, don't they?

520
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,237
There are so many mothers in the world

521
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,200
who have lost their children,

522
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,237
and yet they still have

523
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,800
to carry on with grief.

524
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,560
When I compare myself to them,
I feel incredibly fortunate.

525
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,640
Professor Ren,

526
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,200
thank you.
Thank you for your compassion,

527
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,000
and thank you for guiding us

528
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,640
through this journey.

529
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,960
My greatest realisation now

530
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,720
is that simply being alive
holds the greatest significance.

531
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,280
Xia is right.

532
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,640
Everyone

533
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,240
has to confront our own difficulties.

534
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,600
If these difficulties remain unresolved,

535
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,720
they can manifest as illness,

536
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,360
either physical illness

537
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,120
or mental illness.

538
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,120
Jian Xi,

539
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,757
I know how much

540
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,000
you used to value your freedom.

541
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,720
It's tough being confined
to this wheelchair now.

542
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,480
But you have to promise me

543
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,080
not to give up.

544
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,440
I believe that
as long as we're together,

545
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,480
there's no obstacle we can't overcome.

546
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,080
Whether we find
the 300-year-old tiles or not,

547
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,880
you will always be my dearest daughter.

548
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,157
You're looking for 300-year-old tiles?

549
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,040
Yes, yes.

550
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,360
You should've come to me.

551
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,877
There is this mountain I just visited.

552
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,757
There are plenty

553
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,360
of old houses there,

554
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,120
dating back

555
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,360
several hundred years.

556
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,840
Maybe you'll find the tile
you're looking for.

557
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,840
I'll get it for you.

558
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,277
Okay, okay. Thank you.

559
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,120
Madam Jiang, you can
still travel that far?

560
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,800
Professor Ren said

561
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,480
movement generates Yang energy.

562
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,160
By serving others,

563
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,637
doing good deeds,

564
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,677
by contributing,

565
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,400
I can extend my life.

566
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,360
Well said.

567
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,040
Jian Xi,

568
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,400
you see,

569
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,920
among us today, we have the elderly,

570
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,200
your brothers and sisters,

571
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,600
uncles and aunties,

572
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,440
we all share one purpose,

573
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,320
and that is, we love you.

574
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,720
So, tell me,

575
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,120
what reason do you have

576
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,120
to give up on life?

577
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,160
When a great physician
treats an illness,

578
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,880
he must be calm in spirit,

579
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,800
and free from desires.

580
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,760
He must first have
a compassionate heart,

581
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,517
and be committed to relieve
the sufferings of all people.

582
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,120
When someone in distress seeks help,

583
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,117
the physician must not discriminate
on their social status, wealth,

584
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,600
age, appearance,

585
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,600
their relationships,

586
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,240
or their intellect.

587
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,880
They should treat all equally,

588
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,357
with the same care and concern as
they would for their own loved ones.

589
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,757
The physician should not
hesitate or worry

590
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,397
about personal gain or loss,

591
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,917
or personal safety,

592
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,640
but wholeheartedly

593
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,757
respond to their suffering,

594
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,360
be it hunger, thirst, or fatigue,

595
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,357
without seeking recognition
or expecting rewards.

596
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,240
Such a physician can be considered
a healer for all beings,

597
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,680
while deviating from this path would
make them a thief of life and spirit.

598
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,040
Throughout history,
renowned healers have often

599
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,800
sacrificed their lives
to save those in dire circumstances,

600
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,400
regardless of whether
they're noble or lowly.

601
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,280
Such is their dedication
to preserving life...

602
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,800
(Zhao Li Quan)

603
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:38,160
Your dad really wasn't lying to me.

604
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,600
You're talking nonsense.
Where did that come from?

605
00:25:42,439 --> 00:25:44,439
The first time your dad came to me,

606
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,520
he claimed
to have extraordinary abilities,

607
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,080
to be able to control the Yang energy,

608
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,597
and manifest his thoughts

609
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,960
into reality.

610
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,080
I was sceptical at that time.

611
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,536
But today,

612
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,117
seeing the establishment

613
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,360
of our new apprentice class,

614
00:26:01,686 --> 00:26:02,869
I believe him now.

615
00:26:03,439 --> 00:26:04,583
I really believe him now.

616
00:26:05,326 --> 00:26:06,446
Madam Jiang was right.

617
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,120
He's really omnipotent.

618
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,560
I finally figured it out.

619
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,720
You and your dad

620
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,037
just can't get along.

621
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,200
The two of you,

622
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,997
one likes to bluff,
and the other believes everything.

623
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,280
When did I bluff?

624
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,120
I'm telling the truth.

625
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,640
I've never in my life

626
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,080
seen someone so extraordinary.

627
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,600
His promises,

628
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,920
the people he said he would save,
he fulfilled them.

629
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,277
You don't know about
the promise he didn't fulfil, do you?

630
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,440
He won't tell you that.

631
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,840
Promise he didn't fulfil?

632
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,240
What didn't he fulfil?

633
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,560
I'm not telling you.

634
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,000
Just tell me.

635
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,997
You can't keep a secret.

636
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,037
I can keep a secret.

637
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,960
Your dad asked me to keep
a secret for him. And I never...

638
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,600
What secret did my dad ask you to keep?

639
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,360
I promised him.

640
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,560
I can't say.

641
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,400
Then I'll tell you a big secret
about my dad.

642
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,440
I found out myself.

643
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,120
Will you exchange it
for your secret with my dad?

644
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,160
No.

645
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,120
All right. Give me the plaque.

646
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,480
The plaque, please.

647
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,240
My dad has a girlfriend.

648
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,160
Will you exchange it now?

649
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:35,840
That's impossible!

650
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,080
Your dad isn't that kind of man.

651
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,840
You're lying.

652
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,557
You want to trick me into
telling you my secret,

653
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,197
then you will tell me
you're just bluffing,

654
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,080
am I right?

655
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,240
The name of my dad's girlfriend

656
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,680
is Little Lark.

657
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,040
It's a bird's name?

658
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,400
What kind of name is that?

659
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,600
Only you could come up
with such a lousy trick.

660
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,400
Unbelievable.

661
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,360
Who told you to hang it up?

662
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,680
Take it down!

663
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,520
Didn't you ask us to hang it up?

664
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,800
Take it down first.

665
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,560
Take it down!

666
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,720
I'm not worthy of this plaque.

667
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,160
One must be cautious
and restrain oneself.

668
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,200
Wu Cheng En said that.

669
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,440
I can cure others' illnesses,

670
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,400
but I can't change their fate.

671
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,437
Madam Jiang recovered

672
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,320
because of a change in her mindset.

673
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,077
I cure someone's illness,

674
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,720
and the next day they come back again.

675
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,157
They keep revolving

676
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,520
in this cycle.

677
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,520
Zhu Chang Ming.

678
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,240
Zhu Chang Ming is like that.

679
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,320
If someone wants to break free
from this cycle,

680
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,637
they have to rely on
their own willpower

681
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:54,600
and change their past habits, you know?

682
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,880
The reason I won't accept this plaque

683
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,040
is because it's stolen achievement,

684
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,400
taking credit for someone else's work.

685
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,760
Then why did you accept it
in the first place?

686
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,840
Even if my EQ was low,

687
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,080
I wouldn't refuse.

688
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,917
It was a congratulatory gift
given to me when I started my business.

689
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,040
How about this?
I'll place it behind the chair.

690
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,957
This way, it won't disappoint
the elderly who gave it to you,

691
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,600
and it won't bother you.

692
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:24,960
Just leave it there.

693
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:35,920
Tou Tou.

694
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:44,960
We have left

695
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,480
your fate in your hands now.

696
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,600
Success or failure,

697
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,680
it all depends on you.

698
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,280
Master,

699
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,397
I used to dismiss phrases

700
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,600
like "hard work can
change your destiny".

701
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,480
Because delivery riders like us,

702
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,080
we work hard,

703
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,440
but I haven't

704
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,360
seen anyone skyrocket to success.

705
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:19,880
But I

706
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,280
believe it now.

707
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,320
I really believe it now.

708
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,200
Because I see Zhu Xia,

709
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,360
Madam Jiang,

710
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,840
and Cheng Ying,

711
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,720
they are all making efforts
to change their own destiny.

712
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,237
They are still dealt a bad hand,

713
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,120
but

714
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,760
they haven't given up

715
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,080
and continue to persist.

716
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,320
So I feel that

717
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,877
since I have

718
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,960
a high starting point now,
I am also a successor.

719
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:49,920
I think...

720
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,200
I can make it.

721
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,520
Right?

722
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,117
-It smells so nice.
-I know, right?

723
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,240
Wine is the essence of food.

724
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:25,080
Pour some more.
We have two good news today.

725
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,720
We should drink a lot of wine.

726
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,997
Dad, where did we get two good news?

727
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,960
-That's right.
-I regained

728
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,760
my house,

729
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,600
that's the first good news.

730
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,960
The apprentice class reopened,

731
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,320
that's the second good news.

732
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,320
We should celebrate and drink a lot.

733
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,120
Master,

734
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,760
Ling Lan

735
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,677
never thought of selling your house.

736
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,717
If she wanted to sell,

737
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,320
it would be our house,

738
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,840
but she didn't tell you on purpose.

739
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,320
She wanted to make you worry.

740
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,400
Master,

741
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,277
let me toast to you.

742
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,480
I'd like to thank you

743
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,877
for your contribution towards TCM,

744
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,157
and for your kindness and care

745
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,120
towards me.

746
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,440
-Maybe I should kowtow to you as well.
-No, no!

747
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,877
This is nonsense.

748
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,037
You're toasting to me

749
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,117
and kowtowing to me.

750
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,877
-Are you jinxing me?
-No, no.

751
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,880
You should raise

752
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,637
a toast to my wife instead.

753
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,397
She's a remarkable woman.

754
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,557
Yes, let me kowtow to her.

755
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,000
No, no.

756
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,280
Both of us are getting old.

757
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,037
In the future, the one who will
support you and help you

758
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,640
is your spouse.

759
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,837
Ling Lan has gone through a lot.

760
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,080
Should I kowtow to Ling Lan?

761
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,557
I will thank you then.

762
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,800
I will kowtow to you later.

763
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,997
Thank you for staying by my side
all these years,

764
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,640
even though I'm not

765
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,360
-a capable man.
-Drink up!

766
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,520
I'm toasting along.

767
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,040
Just one glass.

768
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,200
Who just said he was going
to kowtow to me?

769
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:07,960
Go on.

770
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,920
I already kowtowed to you in my heart.

771
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,240
Don't sigh.

772
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,320
Every day when I look at you at home,

773
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,560
I feel so frustrated.

774
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,760
How did I

775
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,317
end up marrying a husband

776
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,880
who isn't strong,

777
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,360
doesn't make a lot of money

778
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,840
and always causes trouble outside?

779
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,120
My life is so miserable.

780
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,920
But,

781
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:45,880
Professor Ren,

782
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,920
you know, when you were
lecturing on stage,

783
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,800
when I looked at you up there,

784
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,160
I still admired you.

785
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,240
I mean it.

786
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,240
I'm not joking.

787
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,200
You see,

788
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,840
people like you,

789
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,840
who still

790
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,320
have such passion,

791
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,400
are selflessly and

792
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,197
wholeheartedly devoted to TCM.

793
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,360
You would even die for...

794
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,637
No, I mean...

795
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:14,760
Master, she's jinxing you.

796
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,800
Conquer death and turn things around.

797
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,680
I mean,

798
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,317
you see, you truly

799
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:26,117
dedicate yourself to TCM,
with unwavering focus

800
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,037
and the willingness...

801
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,480
The willingness to sacrifice
your personal life and career.

802
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,920
Not many people can do what you've done.

803
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,760
I truly admire you
from the bottom of my heart.

804
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,400
Here's to you.

805
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,480
Does that mean you won't
scold me anymore in the future?

806
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,480
Finish this drink, and I'll answer you.

807
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,120
-Here.
-Drink up.

808
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:51,880
Dad!

809
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,840
I'm toasting along again. Just one.

810
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,080
-Unbelievable.
-I'll answer you now.

811
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,760
In the future,

812
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,920
don't keep hovering around me
all the time.

813
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,477
Just stand on that podium

814
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,317
and give your lectures
with all your dedication.

815
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,480
I believe that way

816
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,077
we can maintain

817
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,400
a stable marital relationship.

818
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,840
Dad, she won't scold you anymore.
She will scold me instead.

819
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,200
It's not the same.

820
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,000
Son, let me tell you the truth.

821
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,360
Actually, every time after I scold you,

822
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,600
I feel really guilty inside.

823
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,360
Because I think

824
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,840
you are an angel

825
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,000
sent to me by God.

826
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,080
But

827
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,000
every time after I scold your dad,

828
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,040
I always feel like it's not enough.

829
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,920
You see, there's a difference
between someone

830
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,400
who came from your own belly
and someone who didn't.

831
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,317
You're right, Mum.

832
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,237
Here's to you.

833
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,800
-Okay.
-Okay.

834
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,440
-Here's to Master.
-Here.

835
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,160
-Master.
-Except for Dad,

836
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,120
the rest of you, raise your glass.

837
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,200
Come on.

838
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,800
Tou Tou, don't drink too much.

839
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,440
Madam.

840
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,840
Master, here's to you.

841
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,400
Meng Meng can't drink.

842
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,840
Yes.

843
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,400
Here.

844
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,317
-Cut it down.
-Meng Meng won't drink.

845
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,840
Just a sip, just a sip.

846
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,560
Look at him!

847
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,960
I'll just have one glass.

848
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,000
It's a nice wine.

849
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,880
-Come on.
-Have some veggies, Mum.

850
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,480
Who is it?

851
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,440
I'll get the door.

852
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,840
You just stay.

853
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,360
Rice cakes!

854
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,800
What brings you here?

855
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,320
Why all of a sudden?

856
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,600
It's not sudden.

857
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,317
Meng Meng has halted
her study for over a year.

858
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,200
Besides,

859
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,520
her recent condition
has been quite good.

860
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,077
We've been thinking about letting
her return to school in September

861
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,200
when the semester resumes.

862
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,760
But she hasn't fully recovered yet.

863
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,200
It would be risky for her
to go back to school now.

864
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,920
We have considered that as well,

865
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,200
that's why we want
to take her home earlier.

866
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,360
We'll let her adapt for a while
according to the school's schedule.

867
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,120
Yes.

868
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,840
Your considerations are very thoughtful.

869
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,640
But rest assured that

870
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,240
we will take her
for regular follow-up appointments.

871
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,400
Thank you, Dr Ren.

872
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,077
And of course, thank you, Dr Song.

873
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,237
Thank you

874
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,000
for always thinking for Meng Meng.

875
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,797
However, Meng Meng

876
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,237
hasn't completed
her high school education yet.

877
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,680
She still needs to study
and gain practical experience

878
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,040
to eventually enter
the workforce on her own.

879
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,480
Yes.

880
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,160
Meng Meng,

881
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,240
after you go home, eat well

882
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,200
and sleep well.

883
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,400
My phone is on all day long.

884
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,517
If you need anything,

885
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,120
feel free to call me, okay?

886
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,320
We will also go visit you.

887
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:26,880
Meng Meng's gone?

888
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,120
She left her doll here.

889
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,757
Sit down and eat first.
You can give it to her tomorrow.

890
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,837
But she left her doll here.

891
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,080
-Give it to her tomorrow.
-No need. She will come back.

892
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,280
Come.

893
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,320
All good things must come to an end.

894
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,320
It is only right

895
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,640
for her to go home.

896
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,080
Come on, let's eat.

897
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,440
Let's eat.

898
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:00,520
Come on.

899
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,880
You know,

900
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,680
Meng Meng is usually quiet
and is barely invisible,

901
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,840
but now that she's gone,

902
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,280
it just feels like something is missing.

903
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,077
Room service.

904
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,080
I don't want any food.

905
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,840
Will you help me check
my TikTok account?

906
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:25,877
My dear grandson,

907
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,640
my account is unusable now.

908
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,600
It's killing me.

909
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,040
Come on, help me.

910
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,320
Come on.

911
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,720
I'm here to serve you dinner.

912
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,080
Aren't I considerate, my master?

913
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,317
Grandpa, I told you,

914
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,880
I'm not in the mood
to eat anything.

915
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:55,920
You see,

916
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,680
you have lost your appetite

917
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,440
and you seem down.

918
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,360
You must be sick.

919
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,480
I'm not sick.

920
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,797
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

921
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,277

traditional Chinese medicine books)
