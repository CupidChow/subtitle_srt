00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,880
(Gen Z)

2
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,120
(Episode 25)

3
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,031
Today, we have another happy occasion.

4
00:01:45,951 --> 00:01:47,951
I met an old patient of mine,

5
00:01:48,356 --> 00:01:49,716
which is Madam Jiang Li.

6
00:01:50,871 --> 00:01:51,671
So, I would like

7
00:01:51,751 --> 00:01:54,151
to invite Madam Jiang Li

8
00:01:54,424 --> 00:01:56,984
to give us the opening speech.

9
00:01:57,831 --> 00:01:59,271
Let's give her a round of applause.

10
00:02:05,831 --> 00:02:06,671
First of all,

11
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:07,836
I'd like to thank

12
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,391
Professor Ren

13
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,191
for giving me a second chance at life.

14
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,630
Before this,

15
00:02:15,031 --> 00:02:17,391
I was diagnosed with late-stage cancer.

16
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,511
Professor Ren enlightened me.

17
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,880
My illness was healed
miraculously and completely!

18
00:02:24,831 --> 00:02:26,110
Now, I am

19
00:02:26,311 --> 00:02:27,391
in the best time

20
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:29,230
of my life.

21
00:02:30,031 --> 00:02:30,831
Kids,

22
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,110
you must study hard.

23
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,470
Preserve and pass on

24
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:36,910
the precious knowledge

25
00:02:37,671 --> 00:02:39,191
of TCM.

26
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,870
Madam Jiang, you mustn't
say something like that.

27
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:43,590
You might give others the wrong idea.

28
00:02:43,751 --> 00:02:44,551
It's not scientific.

29
00:02:44,751 --> 00:02:45,910
How is it not scientific?

30
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,040
I don't care
whether it's scientific or not.

31
00:02:49,111 --> 00:02:50,190
Whoever saved my life

32
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,590
is a good doctor.

33
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,190
Thank you, Madam Jiang.

34
00:02:54,391 --> 00:02:55,671
Thank you. Thank you.

35
00:03:01,863 --> 00:03:03,630
Some of you may not know this.

36
00:03:03,711 --> 00:03:06,430
The student who brought that up
just now is Peng Shi Yan.

37
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,441
He is a doctor of Western medicine.

38
00:03:09,371 --> 00:03:11,610
He's also the class leader
of our TCM class.

39
00:03:12,311 --> 00:03:13,270
He's right.

40
00:03:14,804 --> 00:03:16,003
TCM is unscientific,

41
00:03:16,537 --> 00:03:18,737
because it is a field of study.

42
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,830
I don't know if you've read
this book before, Peng.

43
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:28,550
There is a philosopher of science
named Karl Popper.

44
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,391
He wrote a book called

45
00:03:30,718 --> 00:03:32,317
"Objective Knowledge",

46
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:35,190
which some of you
may have read it before.

47
00:03:36,311 --> 00:03:38,550
In this book, he discusses

48
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:40,311
the concept of three worlds

49
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,120
and their interrelations.

50
00:03:43,111 --> 00:03:43,911
He believes

51
00:03:44,551 --> 00:03:45,831
that falsifiability

52
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,150
is what defines science.

53
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,070
You should know that

54
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,199
there were the geocentric model

55
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,591
and the heliocentric model,

56
00:03:56,031 --> 00:03:58,564
which were considered
scientific back then.

57
00:03:59,271 --> 00:04:00,071
Science

58
00:04:00,671 --> 00:04:02,031
is the process

59
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:04,031
that guides us step by step towards

60
00:04:04,191 --> 00:04:05,311
understanding the truth.

61
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:08,031
It is measurable

62
00:04:09,471 --> 00:04:10,271
and calculable.

63
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:13,831
However, have you ever wondered, Peng,

64
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:16,590
how music and painting

65
00:04:17,551 --> 00:04:18,870
can be scientifically measured?

66
00:04:19,671 --> 00:04:20,950
How do we quantify

67
00:04:21,311 --> 00:04:22,191
the pain of a disease?

68
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,271
We have sent rockets into space,

69
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,430
but how do we fathom a woman's heart?

70
00:04:29,584 --> 00:04:31,064
So our world

71
00:04:32,671 --> 00:04:35,150
is divided into
many different dimensions.

72
00:04:36,364 --> 00:04:37,430
There is the subjective

73
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:39,031
and the objective.

74
00:04:39,831 --> 00:04:40,910
(Wu Yu)
We shouldn't treat

75
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,430
the subjective as the only reality,

76
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,950
nor should we take the objective

77
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,400
as the sole standard.

78
00:04:46,471 --> 00:04:47,471
Just like how humans

79
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,350
are composed of two

80
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,870
or even three parts.

81
00:04:53,191 --> 00:04:54,751
One part is the body,

82
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:57,070
which everyone is familiar with.

83
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:01,430
Western medicine has made great progress

84
00:05:02,391 --> 00:05:03,950
in understanding the body,

85
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:05,751
such as in the fields of data,

86
00:05:07,324 --> 00:05:08,203
bacteria,

87
00:05:09,311 --> 00:05:10,111
and imaging.

88
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:11,763
Their achievements are remarkable.

89
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:13,990
Besides the body,

90
00:05:15,311 --> 00:05:16,751
we also have the mind.

91
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:20,831
When measuring a person's health,

92
00:05:21,423 --> 00:05:24,303
we consider both the physical

93
00:05:24,831 --> 00:05:26,751
and mental aspects.

94
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:28,976
The body should be strong and agile,

95
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,864
while the mind should be
stable and composed.

96
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,590
Apart from these two,

97
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,609
I believe there is another aspect.

98
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,191
The spirit.

99
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,350
The spirituality.

100
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:44,990
It means that our thoughts

101
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,400
should have higher aspirations.

102
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,671
You all heard what Madam Jiang
said just now.

103
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:53,990
From the physical aspect,

104
00:05:54,831 --> 00:05:55,910
she was terminally ill.

105
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,191
Western medicine might not
have been able to treat her.

106
00:06:01,951 --> 00:06:03,590
If it weren't for TCM,

107
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:05,430
she might have experienced

108
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:08,070
a painful death during the process

109
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:09,590
of being sentenced to death.

110
00:06:11,677 --> 00:06:12,917
Fortunately, we have TCM.

111
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,395
I encouraged her
to pray to gods and deities.

112
00:06:15,476 --> 00:06:16,276
Does it work?

113
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,480
I'm not going to discuss
about supernatural beings here.

114
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,710
I simply hoped that

115
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:23,710
in the final stage

116
00:06:23,951 --> 00:06:26,390
of Madam Jiang's life,

117
00:06:26,931 --> 00:06:27,990
she could find

118
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:31,803
a sense of connection with the universe,

119
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,150
with all living beings,

120
00:06:34,824 --> 00:06:36,663
and ultimately with herself.

121
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:41,270
It's better than

122
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:42,870
living in agony.

123
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:51,990
After all, climbing mountains

124
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,280
and prostrating

125
00:06:54,031 --> 00:06:55,311
are forms of physical activity.

126
00:06:55,751 --> 00:06:57,191
-Right?
-Right.

127
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:00,310
They are better than lying down.

128
00:07:01,351 --> 00:07:02,151
Because movement

129
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:03,710
generates Yang energy,

130
00:07:04,751 --> 00:07:07,270
and Yang energy brings vitality.

131
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,063
Let's give a round of applause
to Madam Jiang.

132
00:07:15,751 --> 00:07:17,550
So, according to the theories of TCM,

133
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,390
the power of the mind

134
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,423
is greater than that of the body.

135
00:07:24,191 --> 00:07:26,231
When a person has a strong faith

136
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,670
and a strong will,

137
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,110
they can certainly overcome

138
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:34,270
the unbearable pain within the body.

139
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:38,750
Let me give you an example.

140
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:40,350
Peng,

141
00:07:41,351 --> 00:07:42,270
say

142
00:07:42,951 --> 00:07:44,270
there's a car outside,

143
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,710
and I'll give you 10,000 yuan

144
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:48,071
for you to lift it up.

145
00:07:48,751 --> 00:07:49,790
Don't be silly.

146
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:51,156
I'm not that strong.

147
00:07:53,951 --> 00:07:54,911
How about one million?

148
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:56,510
One million?

149
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,200
Then I'll give it a try.

150
00:07:58,590 --> 00:07:59,390
Peng Shi Yan,

151
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:01,110
that's one million yuan.

152
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,263
If you can't lift it up,
I'm going to beat you up.

153
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:05,871
But even if I exert all my strength,

154
00:08:05,951 --> 00:08:06,990
I can't do it.

155
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,070
Shi Yan,

156
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:11,110
what if it's your own child

157
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,751
under the car?

158
00:08:14,191 --> 00:08:14,991
I can lift it up.

159
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,599
Mr Ren, I really can.

160
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,880
A mother can.

161
00:08:19,751 --> 00:08:20,911
A mother really can.

162
00:08:21,251 --> 00:08:22,131
You can

163
00:08:22,311 --> 00:08:23,350
look it up online.

164
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,951
Many mothers can do it.

165
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:27,910
They can surpass your
understanding of human capabilities.

166
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,350
Everyone knows

167
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:31,550
that humans have potential.

168
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,800
We would sacrifice our lives

169
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:37,071
for our ideals,

170
00:08:38,231 --> 00:08:39,270
for our beliefs.

171
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,990
We would sacrifice ourselves

172
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,911
to save others.

173
00:08:47,351 --> 00:08:48,471
On this point,

174
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:50,951
from a scientific perspective,

175
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,679
this remains a mystery.

176
00:08:54,031 --> 00:08:55,270
So, I believe...

177
00:08:57,551 --> 00:09:00,910
I believe that
Western medicine is a skill.

178
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:06,351
It can be standardized

179
00:09:07,471 --> 00:09:08,830
and replicated on a large scale.

180
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,471
But TCM is different.

181
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,590
I see TCM

182
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,791
as a personal cultivation,

183
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,150
as the Way.

184
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,351
That's why I established

185
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,590
the apprentice class.

186
00:09:30,951 --> 00:09:32,484
By establishing the apprentice class,

187
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:35,150
by forming

188
00:09:36,636 --> 00:09:38,277
a master-apprentice relationship,

189
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,479
I can find people

190
00:09:41,557 --> 00:09:42,796
who resonate with me

191
00:09:43,071 --> 00:09:45,750
on the same frequency.

192
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:46,870
Only in this way

193
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:48,590
can the Way of TCM

194
00:09:50,209 --> 00:09:51,609
be truly passed down.

195
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,200
After establishing scholarships
for so many years,

196
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,456
this is the first time I've been
provided this kind of service.

197
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,399
Professor Wu,

198
00:10:14,119 --> 00:10:16,439
your approach is indeed
different from Professor Ren's.

199
00:10:16,537 --> 00:10:17,750
You've been hiding your light
under a bushel.

200
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,070
Oh, I can't compare to Xin Zheng.

201
00:10:20,151 --> 00:10:22,591
He is the real expert.

202
00:10:22,951 --> 00:10:24,511
He's surrounded by talented individuals.

203
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:25,391
My abilities

204
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:26,830
are limited,

205
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:30,030
but I can still help you

206
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:33,230
with the issue of overexertion
and muscle soreness.

207
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:34,871
I have some solutions for that.

208
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:35,710
Honestly,

209
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:38,316
the foot massage here is excellent.
You'll know once you try it.

210
00:10:38,951 --> 00:10:40,230
Come now.

211
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:44,391
You need to experience
everything personally.

212
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:46,151
The feeling is different.

213
00:10:47,391 --> 00:10:49,950
Hi, I'm masseur 030158.

214
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,071
It's my pleasure to serve you.

215
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,030
-Hi.
-Hi.

216
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,840
I'm masseur 030128.
I'm here to serve you.

217
00:10:53,877 --> 00:10:55,157
-Come.
-Come.

218
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:01,751
Mr Wu.

219
00:11:03,711 --> 00:11:04,751
What are you doing here?

220
00:11:06,151 --> 00:11:09,151
The new apprentice class
starts today, right?

221
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,191
I have a guest with me now.

222
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:12,350
I'll join them later.

223
00:11:15,151 --> 00:11:16,951
Mr Wu, do you know him?

224
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:18,723
Mr Zheng, allow me to introduce.

225
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,949
This is Zhao Li Quan,

226
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,870
a talented and outstanding student
from our University of TCM,

227
00:11:21,951 --> 00:11:22,831
a top achiever.

228
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:25,950
Zhao, this is Mr Zheng,

229
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,030
who sponsors the scholarship
of our university.

230
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:32,631
He sponsored the scholarship
you received for your studies.

231
00:11:33,711 --> 00:11:34,711
Thank you. Mr Zheng.

232
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:36,790
We have met before.

233
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:41,271
Was it during the scholarship
award ceremony at the school?

234
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,310
There was also another time when I
went to your estate for picking mugwort.

235
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,560
Oh, right.

236
00:11:53,831 --> 00:11:56,030
I led the team that time.

237
00:11:56,711 --> 00:11:59,184
Among all my students,
I especially enjoy taking him along.

238
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:01,591
Mr Zheng, let me tell you,

239
00:12:01,831 --> 00:12:03,150
the young generation nowadays

240
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,441
is truly remarkable.

241
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,117
Take Zhao as an example,

242
00:12:06,511 --> 00:12:09,831
he went from undergraduate
to master's degree.

243
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,511
He's different from other masseurs.

244
00:12:13,271 --> 00:12:15,150
He truly applies what he learned

245
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:18,230
into practical experience.

246
00:12:19,391 --> 00:12:21,511
That's why I specially
introduced him to you today

247
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:22,950
so that you can experience

248
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:26,591
what high-quality
medical service means.

249
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:29,311
That's great. I'm honoured

250
00:12:29,391 --> 00:12:30,511
to experience it today.

251
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,831
I must give it a try.

252
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:33,930
What are you waiting for? Hurry up.

253
00:12:36,591 --> 00:12:38,071
-Okay.
-Let him serve him.

254
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:41,831
Should I sit up?

255
00:12:41,951 --> 00:12:42,831
Yes, Mr Zheng.

256
00:12:44,071 --> 00:12:44,871
Here.

257
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,909
Is the temperature okay?

258
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:47,551
-Is the temperature okay?
-It's just right.

259
00:12:47,631 --> 00:12:49,311
Do you prefer teabag

260
00:12:49,391 --> 00:12:50,350
or salt?

261
00:12:50,711 --> 00:12:51,511
Teabag.

262
00:12:51,631 --> 00:12:52,431
Okay.

263
00:13:00,564 --> 00:13:01,364
Mr Ren,

264
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,360
earlier, you mentioned
skill and the Way,

265
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,201
standardisation and non-standardisation,

266
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,631
rationality and sensibility,

267
00:13:06,711 --> 00:13:07,951
subjectivity and objectivity.

268
00:13:08,451 --> 00:13:10,771
Medicine is a progressing science.

269
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,391
Our understanding of human
is also constantly advancing.

270
00:13:14,224 --> 00:13:15,063
However, TCM seems

271
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,790
to revolve around the same few books.

272
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,880
Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic,

273
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,149
Compendium of Materia Medica,
Treatise on Cold Damage Diseases.

274
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:21,711
Even the most recent classic

275
00:13:22,271 --> 00:13:23,631
is nearly 500 years old, right?

276
00:13:23,831 --> 00:13:25,271
Can we, as humans,

277
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:26,783
expect ourselves to be the same

278
00:13:27,151 --> 00:13:28,276
as we were 500 years ago?

279
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:30,790
Okay, let's not talk about 500 years.

280
00:13:31,151 --> 00:13:33,640
Even someone from the 1980s
were to travel to the present day,

281
00:13:33,711 --> 00:13:35,183
they would probably starve to death.

282
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,602
Because they wouldn't know
how to use a smartphone.

283
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,630
They can't order food delivery
or even hail a ride.

284
00:13:38,711 --> 00:13:40,511
So, why should we still
rely on prescriptions

285
00:13:40,591 --> 00:13:42,991
from 1,000 or 2.000 years ago
in today's medical practice?

286
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:44,591
Isn't that a fantasy?

287
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:47,291
Peng, look,

288
00:13:47,404 --> 00:13:48,804
you just mentioned that

289
00:13:49,478 --> 00:13:50,278
TCM

290
00:13:51,529 --> 00:13:54,690
hasn't changed in over 2,000 years.

291
00:13:55,951 --> 00:13:56,991
So, let me ask you,

292
00:13:57,071 --> 00:13:58,511
while technology has advanced,

293
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:00,250
have we as humans

294
00:14:01,138 --> 00:14:02,417
changed in

295
00:14:02,698 --> 00:14:03,498
these 2,000 years?

296
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:04,684
Of course.

297
00:14:05,271 --> 00:14:06,150
Human lifespan

298
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:07,390
has significantly increased.

299
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:09,231
Our development of the brain and

300
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,015
our understanding
of genetic sequences

301
00:14:11,096 --> 00:14:12,897
have surpassed
the realm of life and death.

302
00:14:13,516 --> 00:14:14,437
Our control over

303
00:14:14,831 --> 00:14:17,030
the Earth has also greatly increased.

304
00:14:17,711 --> 00:14:18,831
I disagree, Mr Ren.

305
00:14:21,431 --> 00:14:22,910
I don't consider it progress.

306
00:14:23,831 --> 00:14:24,831
Originally, the Earth

307
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,631
was a perfect ecological closed loop.

308
00:14:28,151 --> 00:14:29,191
Ever since humans

309
00:14:29,271 --> 00:14:31,271
became the apex predators
in the food chain,

310
00:14:31,631 --> 00:14:32,950
all the harm done is man-made

311
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:33,951
and is uncontrollable.

312
00:14:34,511 --> 00:14:36,711
So, once humans gain control
over the Earth,

313
00:14:36,951 --> 00:14:38,631
how can you control human desires

314
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:39,710
and prevent them

315
00:14:39,831 --> 00:14:42,230
from harming other species?

316
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,951
Everything has its dual nature.

317
00:14:45,271 --> 00:14:47,391
You can't acknowledge
only side A and deny side B.

318
00:14:47,591 --> 00:14:49,071
In ancient times, people could observe

319
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,949
planets 270 light-years away with
the naked eye and draw them clearly,

320
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:54,430
but now, without wearing glasses,
we can't even see words clearly.

321
00:14:54,511 --> 00:14:56,384
Would you say this is
progress or regression?

322
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,470
Smartphones have become an extension

323
00:15:00,784 --> 00:15:02,623
of ourselves in our daily lives.

324
00:15:02,951 --> 00:15:03,751
We can

325
00:15:03,831 --> 00:15:04,631
hardly function

326
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,240
without our phones

327
00:15:06,591 --> 00:15:07,951
when we leave the house.

328
00:15:08,711 --> 00:15:10,711
Technology is constantly evolving.

329
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,280
However, there are certain things

330
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,910
that haven't changed,

331
00:15:15,071 --> 00:15:16,511
whether it's 2,000 years ago

332
00:15:16,951 --> 00:15:18,271
or 2,000 years from now,

333
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:19,951
and that is

334
00:15:21,271 --> 00:15:22,470
human emotions.

335
00:15:24,391 --> 00:15:25,631
2,000 years ago,

336
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,120
when our parents passed away,

337
00:15:27,296 --> 00:15:28,263
we would cry.

338
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,151
2,000 years later,

339
00:15:30,831 --> 00:15:33,071
just because we have phones,
it doesn't mean

340
00:15:33,711 --> 00:15:34,831
we won't feel sad

341
00:15:35,711 --> 00:15:37,151
when our parents pass away.

342
00:15:40,151 --> 00:15:40,951
Teachers,

343
00:15:41,391 --> 00:15:42,431
when I talk about reason,

344
00:15:42,511 --> 00:15:43,590
you talk about emotions.

345
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,711
When I talk about emotions,
you talk about rules.

346
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:46,871
When I talk about rules,

347
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,080
you talk about human nature.

348
00:15:48,151 --> 00:15:50,830
Can't we communicate
on the same platform?

349
00:15:51,391 --> 00:15:52,191
Here's the thing.

350
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,921
We can't treat TCM and Western medicine

351
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:57,631
the same way

352
00:15:58,849 --> 00:16:00,089
because these two disciplines

353
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:01,511
are inherently

354
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:03,470
different.

355
00:16:04,591 --> 00:16:07,230
You can't force TCM
to be technologically advanced.

356
00:16:07,584 --> 00:16:08,944
If you insist on asking me

357
00:16:09,271 --> 00:16:13,152
which herb in my prescription
treats numbness

358
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:15,830
or which one treats bleeding,

359
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,311
I can't give you an answer.

360
00:16:17,391 --> 00:16:18,950
That's your way of thinking.

361
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:20,230
I can only tell you

362
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,640
that a person is a holistic being,
and medicine is holistic too.

363
00:16:22,711 --> 00:16:24,790
They naturally interact with each other.

364
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:36,470
I have great faith in Professor Ren

365
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,400
because over the years,

366
00:16:38,591 --> 00:16:39,511
we have realised

367
00:16:39,882 --> 00:16:42,350
that science can't solve all problems.

368
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:45,551
In the foreign metropolis where I live,

369
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:47,529
there are many TCM practitioners

370
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:50,591
and doctors specialising
in natural therapies.

371
00:16:50,831 --> 00:16:55,151
What's most interesting
is the philosophy of the East,

372
00:16:55,423 --> 00:16:57,344
including various forms of exercise.

373
00:16:57,884 --> 00:16:59,283
Practices like yoga

374
00:16:59,831 --> 00:17:02,110
are highly regarded by many of us.

375
00:17:10,511 --> 00:17:11,950
Actually, everyone knows that

376
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:14,436
the concept of Tao involves
the interaction of Yin and Yang.

377
00:17:14,631 --> 00:17:15,971
Technology has indeed progressed,

378
00:17:16,831 --> 00:17:18,110
but in the grand scheme

379
00:17:18,751 --> 00:17:21,271
of the universe,

380
00:17:21,511 --> 00:17:23,990
its progress is only a tiny fraction.

381
00:17:24,424 --> 00:17:26,864
We should not magnify it
to encompass everything.

382
00:17:27,271 --> 00:17:29,110
Everyone is aware
of the harm to the body.

383
00:17:29,511 --> 00:17:30,631
The Inner Classic

384
00:17:30,711 --> 00:17:32,470
already explains this very clearly.

385
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:33,990
External pathogens include

386
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:39,110
wind, cold, heat,
dampness, dryness, and fire.

387
00:17:40,511 --> 00:17:41,311
Internal pathogens

388
00:17:41,711 --> 00:17:42,511
involve

389
00:17:42,631 --> 00:17:46,511
excessive joy, anger, worry,
overthinking, fright, and sadness.

390
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:49,711
No matter how much progress we make,

391
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:51,050
these factors

392
00:17:51,631 --> 00:17:52,870
remain unchanged.

393
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:54,830
Mr Ren,

394
00:17:54,951 --> 00:17:56,230
you're mistaken again.

395
00:17:56,711 --> 00:17:57,511
You see,

396
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,909
in ancient times, people often
suffered from hunger and cold,

397
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:00,910
but nowadays,

398
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,440
people are no longer
lacking food and warm clothing.

399
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,560
So why do conditions like

400
00:18:03,631 --> 00:18:05,964
wind, cold, heat, dampness,
dryness, and fire still exist?

401
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,949
That's a very good point you've raised.

402
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:12,110
Have you noticed that

403
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:14,990
young people these days

404
00:18:15,751 --> 00:18:17,951
wear very little clothing during winter?

405
00:18:18,502 --> 00:18:19,350
They wear shorts,

406
00:18:20,423 --> 00:18:21,503
use air conditioning,

407
00:18:22,511 --> 00:18:23,790
and drink cold beverages.

408
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:25,751
Compared to the past,

409
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,743
they are exposed to much more coldness.

410
00:18:29,711 --> 00:18:30,631
I don't understand

411
00:18:30,711 --> 00:18:32,030
the dressing style

412
00:18:32,438 --> 00:18:33,604
of young people nowadays.

413
00:18:33,751 --> 00:18:34,711
During winter,

414
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,511
they expose their ankles

415
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:37,870
and wear pants

416
00:18:38,151 --> 00:18:39,191
with holes all over.

417
00:18:39,271 --> 00:18:41,911
I don't understand. Is that considered

418
00:18:41,991 --> 00:18:43,231
beautiful or ugly?

419
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,751
In ancient times,

420
00:18:44,831 --> 00:18:46,951
this would be described as
"dressed in rags".

421
00:18:52,683 --> 00:18:56,030
I might not have a deep understanding

422
00:18:56,231 --> 00:18:58,310
of the current technology
and fashion trends,

423
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:00,270
but I have observed one thing.

424
00:19:00,711 --> 00:19:02,751
As long as smartphones exist,

425
00:19:02,831 --> 00:19:05,791
Ms Dong's cervical massage business

426
00:19:05,871 --> 00:19:08,311
will continue to thrive.

427
00:19:08,591 --> 00:19:10,751
If more attractive ladies

428
00:19:10,831 --> 00:19:12,151
and energetic young men

429
00:19:12,231 --> 00:19:14,191
continue to wear clothes
with less fabric,

430
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:19,231
our infertility clinic

431
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:20,871
will continue to flourish.

432
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,380
There is a saying in
Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic.

433
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,143
"All pains, itches, and sores

434
00:19:28,236 --> 00:19:29,316
are related to the heart."

435
00:19:29,717 --> 00:19:30,637
You see,

436
00:19:30,717 --> 00:19:32,423
these are diseases on the skin,

437
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,520
but in reality,

438
00:19:33,837 --> 00:19:35,798
they are manifestations
of inner emotional tension.

439
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,560
The body and mind of a person

440
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,522
cannot be completely separated.

441
00:19:40,123 --> 00:19:41,322
The other day,

442
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,442
I attended a lecture by
a Western medicine expert,

443
00:19:43,642 --> 00:19:44,803
Professor Yang Xue Qin

444
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:47,562
from the Air Force General Hospital.

445
00:19:48,042 --> 00:19:51,083
She mentioned that
many patients with psoriasis

446
00:19:51,522 --> 00:19:52,603
actually exhibit

447
00:19:53,209 --> 00:19:56,329
external manifestations
of their emotions.

448
00:19:57,282 --> 00:19:58,282
This coincides

449
00:19:58,522 --> 00:20:01,003
with the theories of TCM.

450
00:20:01,642 --> 00:20:02,762
Therefore, I believe

451
00:20:03,123 --> 00:20:05,303
that the relationship between
TCM and Western medicine

452
00:20:05,522 --> 00:20:07,363
is not one of opposition,

453
00:20:07,642 --> 00:20:10,402
but rather a quest for unity

454
00:20:11,123 --> 00:20:12,603
within their differences.

455
00:20:18,522 --> 00:20:20,003
Ms Song is right.

456
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:21,963
Let me give you another example.

457
00:20:22,843 --> 00:20:24,123
In my office,

458
00:20:25,216 --> 00:20:27,682
I have two pots of tomatoes.
You all have seen them.

459
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:30,130
When we weren't around,

460
00:20:30,642 --> 00:20:32,203
they borne abundant fruits.

461
00:20:32,883 --> 00:20:33,923
However, later on,

462
00:20:34,003 --> 00:20:35,562
when we tried to transplant them

463
00:20:35,642 --> 00:20:36,682
to a better environment

464
00:20:36,762 --> 00:20:38,442
because they were growing so well,

465
00:20:38,588 --> 00:20:40,309
they started to wither.

466
00:20:41,202 --> 00:20:42,923
But when we let them be

467
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,201
and allowed them to grow,

468
00:20:44,488 --> 00:20:45,809
they revived once again.

469
00:20:46,963 --> 00:20:47,883
So, I believe that

470
00:20:48,162 --> 00:20:50,483
in cases of emergencies,

471
00:20:51,843 --> 00:20:52,843
such as cancer,

472
00:20:53,762 --> 00:20:54,923
I am highly supportive

473
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:56,363
of surgical intervention.

474
00:20:56,483 --> 00:20:58,322
If you don't perform surgery,
the illness

475
00:20:58,603 --> 00:20:59,762
will be like

476
00:21:00,003 --> 00:21:01,923
an out-of-control heavy truck

477
00:21:02,003 --> 00:21:03,123
racing on a highway

478
00:21:03,315 --> 00:21:05,396
without brakes.

479
00:21:06,282 --> 00:21:08,003
It will run recklessly,

480
00:21:09,723 --> 00:21:10,803
and the ultimate outcome

481
00:21:10,883 --> 00:21:11,963
is destruction.

482
00:21:13,483 --> 00:21:16,003
Therefore, we perform the surgery,

483
00:21:16,843 --> 00:21:18,042
allowing the patient

484
00:21:18,483 --> 00:21:20,042
to buy some time.

485
00:21:20,762 --> 00:21:21,562
Afterwards,

486
00:21:21,723 --> 00:21:23,162
we apply

487
00:21:23,603 --> 00:21:26,363
a little external force

488
00:21:27,243 --> 00:21:28,203
to assist the patient's

489
00:21:28,762 --> 00:21:30,162
self-repair process.

490
00:21:33,003 --> 00:21:33,803
Remember,

491
00:21:34,963 --> 00:21:36,741
both TCM and Western
medicine practitioners

492
00:21:36,822 --> 00:21:38,783
are not gods who cure diseases,

493
00:21:40,695 --> 00:21:41,936
but rather people

494
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:45,370
who help patients
on their path to health.

495
00:21:50,762 --> 00:21:51,642
Professor Ren,

496
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:54,283
I deeply resonated with
the meaning you just mentioned

497
00:21:54,363 --> 00:21:55,642
about praying to the deities.

498
00:21:56,123 --> 00:21:58,363
Do you remember the first time we met?

499
00:21:59,963 --> 00:22:01,522
I was in such a state of despair.

500
00:22:01,762 --> 00:22:03,963
I felt like I couldn't go on living.

501
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,802
You gave me an ancient prescription.

502
00:22:06,883 --> 00:22:08,243
The search of the ingredients

503
00:22:08,363 --> 00:22:09,963
has kept me going for a year.

504
00:22:10,402 --> 00:22:12,603
I suddenly realised it just now.

505
00:22:13,042 --> 00:22:15,562
Actually, when you asked me
to find 300-year-old tiles,

506
00:22:15,642 --> 00:22:16,442
it was to give me

507
00:22:16,522 --> 00:22:17,843
a buffer period.

508
00:22:18,123 --> 00:22:20,803
So that I could calm down
from my grief and fear,

509
00:22:20,883 --> 00:22:22,642
and then face a new life again,

510
00:22:22,843 --> 00:22:23,643
right?

511
00:22:25,123 --> 00:22:26,963
Thank you for
your thoughtful intentions.

512
00:22:29,363 --> 00:22:30,163
Actually,

513
00:22:30,363 --> 00:22:31,283
during my time

514
00:22:31,363 --> 00:22:33,762
working at the medical centre,

515
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,880
I have met

516
00:22:34,963 --> 00:22:36,363
all sorts of people.

517
00:22:36,603 --> 00:22:38,562
Some appear physically healthy,

518
00:22:38,642 --> 00:22:40,163
but they suffer from mental illness.

519
00:22:40,243 --> 00:22:43,522
Some suffer from both physical
and mental illnesses.

520
00:22:44,243 --> 00:22:45,562
As long as you are alive,

521
00:22:45,642 --> 00:22:47,043
no one's life is perfect.

522
00:22:47,123 --> 00:22:49,283
Everyone faces
their own difficulties, don't they?

523
00:22:50,122 --> 00:22:51,642
There are so many mothers in the world

524
00:22:51,723 --> 00:22:53,603
who have lost their children,

525
00:22:53,723 --> 00:22:54,655
and yet they still have

526
00:22:54,736 --> 00:22:56,217
to carry on with grief.

527
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,999
When I compare myself to them,
I feel incredibly fortunate.

528
00:23:01,243 --> 00:23:02,043
Professor Ren,

529
00:23:02,402 --> 00:23:04,603
thank you.
Thank you for your compassion,

530
00:23:04,762 --> 00:23:06,402
and thank you for guiding us

531
00:23:07,603 --> 00:23:09,042
through this journey.

532
00:23:09,642 --> 00:23:12,363
My greatest realisation now

533
00:23:12,762 --> 00:23:15,123
is that simply being alive
holds the greatest significance.

534
00:23:24,522 --> 00:23:25,682
Xia is right.

535
00:23:26,883 --> 00:23:28,042
Everyone

536
00:23:28,642 --> 00:23:30,642
has to confront our own difficulties.

537
00:23:31,162 --> 00:23:33,003
If these difficulties remain unresolved,

538
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,120
they can manifest as illness,

539
00:23:35,603 --> 00:23:36,762
either physical illness

540
00:23:37,483 --> 00:23:38,522
or mental illness.

541
00:23:41,723 --> 00:23:42,523
Jian Xi,

542
00:23:43,162 --> 00:23:44,163
I know how much

543
00:23:44,243 --> 00:23:46,402
you used to value your freedom.

544
00:23:47,003 --> 00:23:50,123
It's tough being confined
to this wheelchair now.

545
00:23:50,522 --> 00:23:51,883
But you have to promise me

546
00:23:52,522 --> 00:23:53,483
not to give up.

547
00:23:54,642 --> 00:23:56,843
I believe that
as long as we're together,

548
00:23:57,243 --> 00:23:58,883
there's no obstacle we can't overcome.

549
00:23:59,603 --> 00:24:01,483
Whether we find
the 300-year-old tiles or not,

550
00:24:02,642 --> 00:24:04,282
you will always be my dearest daughter.

551
00:24:15,642 --> 00:24:17,562
You're looking for 300-year-old tiles?

552
00:24:17,642 --> 00:24:18,442
Yes, yes.

553
00:24:18,642 --> 00:24:19,762
You should've come to me.

554
00:24:20,003 --> 00:24:21,283
There is this mountain I just visited.

555
00:24:21,363 --> 00:24:22,163
There are plenty

556
00:24:22,243 --> 00:24:23,762
of old houses there,

557
00:24:24,123 --> 00:24:25,522
dating back

558
00:24:25,843 --> 00:24:26,762
several hundred years.

559
00:24:26,883 --> 00:24:29,243
Maybe you'll find the tile
you're looking for.

560
00:24:29,402 --> 00:24:30,243
I'll get it for you.

561
00:24:30,363 --> 00:24:31,682
Okay, okay. Thank you.

562
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:33,522
Madam Jiang, you can
still travel that far?

563
00:24:34,883 --> 00:24:36,203
Professor Ren said

564
00:24:36,762 --> 00:24:37,883
movement generates Yang energy.

565
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,599
By serving others,

566
00:24:39,762 --> 00:24:41,043
doing good deeds,

567
00:24:41,123 --> 00:24:42,082
by contributing,

568
00:24:42,162 --> 00:24:43,803
I can extend my life.

569
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:44,790
Well said.

570
00:24:55,642 --> 00:24:56,442
Jian Xi,

571
00:24:57,003 --> 00:24:57,803
you see,

572
00:24:58,642 --> 00:25:01,323
among us today, we have the elderly,

573
00:25:02,483 --> 00:25:04,603
your brothers and sisters,

574
00:25:06,642 --> 00:25:08,003
uncles and aunties,

575
00:25:08,363 --> 00:25:09,843
we all share one purpose,

576
00:25:16,642 --> 00:25:17,722
and that is, we love you.

577
00:25:20,282 --> 00:25:21,123
So, tell me,

578
00:25:22,123 --> 00:25:23,522
what reason do you have

579
00:25:24,762 --> 00:25:26,522
to give up on life?

580
00:25:31,883 --> 00:25:33,576
When a great physician
treats an illness,

581
00:25:34,003 --> 00:25:35,282
he must be calm in spirit,

582
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,200
and free from desires.

583
00:25:37,843 --> 00:25:40,162
He must first have
a compassionate heart,

584
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,922
and be committed to relieve
the sufferings of all people.

585
00:25:43,003 --> 00:25:45,522
When someone in distress seeks help,

586
00:25:45,723 --> 00:25:48,523
the physician must not discriminate
on their social status, wealth,

587
00:25:48,603 --> 00:25:50,003
age, appearance,

588
00:25:50,243 --> 00:25:52,003
their relationships,

589
00:25:52,203 --> 00:25:53,642
or their intellect.

590
00:25:53,883 --> 00:25:55,282
They should treat all equally,

591
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,762
with the same care and concern as
they would for their own loved ones.

592
00:25:57,843 --> 00:26:00,163
The physician should not
hesitate or worry

593
00:26:00,243 --> 00:26:01,803
about personal gain or loss,

594
00:26:01,883 --> 00:26:03,322
or personal safety,

595
00:26:03,402 --> 00:26:05,042
but wholeheartedly

596
00:26:28,243 --> 00:26:30,163
respond to their suffering,

597
00:26:30,243 --> 00:26:31,762
be it hunger, thirst, or fatigue,

598
00:26:32,003 --> 00:26:34,763
without seeking recognition
or expecting rewards.

599
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:37,642
Such a physician can be considered
a healer for all beings,

600
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,109
while deviating from this path would
make them a thief of life and spirit.

601
00:26:41,363 --> 00:26:43,442
Throughout history,
renowned healers have often

602
00:26:43,762 --> 00:26:46,202
sacrificed their lives
to save those in dire circumstances,

603
00:26:46,642 --> 00:26:48,802
regardless of whether
they're noble or lowly.

604
00:26:49,243 --> 00:26:50,682
Such is their dedication
to preserving life...

605
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,213
(Zhao Li Quan)

606
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:13,562
Your dad really wasn't lying to me.

607
00:27:14,963 --> 00:27:17,003
You're talking nonsense.
Where did that come from?

608
00:27:17,963 --> 00:27:19,963
The first time your dad came to me,

609
00:27:21,003 --> 00:27:23,042
he claimed
to have extraordinary abilities,

610
00:27:23,522 --> 00:27:25,483
to be able to control the Yang energy,

611
00:27:25,762 --> 00:27:27,003
and manifest his thoughts

612
00:27:27,083 --> 00:27:28,363
into reality.

613
00:27:28,762 --> 00:27:30,483
I was sceptical at that time.

614
00:27:31,762 --> 00:27:32,562
But today,

615
00:27:33,123 --> 00:27:34,523
seeing the establishment

616
00:27:34,603 --> 00:27:35,762
of our new apprentice class,

617
00:27:37,243 --> 00:27:38,043
I believe him now.

618
00:27:38,963 --> 00:27:40,003
I really believe him now.

619
00:27:40,642 --> 00:27:41,762
Madam Jiang was right.

620
00:27:42,042 --> 00:27:43,522
He's really omnipotent.

621
00:27:49,522 --> 00:27:50,963
I finally figured it out.

622
00:27:51,282 --> 00:27:52,123
You and your dad

623
00:27:52,363 --> 00:27:53,442
just can't get along.

624
00:27:53,522 --> 00:27:54,603
The two of you,

625
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,400
one likes to bluff,
and the other believes everything.

626
00:27:56,489 --> 00:27:57,690
When did I bluff?

627
00:27:58,003 --> 00:27:59,522
I'm telling the truth.

628
00:28:00,203 --> 00:28:01,069
I've never in my life

629
00:28:01,603 --> 00:28:03,483
seen someone so extraordinary.

630
00:28:04,003 --> 00:28:05,009
His promises,

631
00:28:05,162 --> 00:28:07,322
the people he said he would save,
he fulfilled them.

632
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,681
You don't know about
the promise he didn't fulfil, do you?

633
00:28:10,762 --> 00:28:11,843
He won't tell you that.

634
00:28:14,243 --> 00:28:15,243
Promise he didn't fulfil?

635
00:28:16,843 --> 00:28:17,643
What didn't he fulfil?

636
00:28:18,162 --> 00:28:18,962
I'm not telling you.

637
00:28:19,243 --> 00:28:20,402
Just tell me.

638
00:28:21,402 --> 00:28:22,403
You can't keep a secret.

639
00:28:22,483 --> 00:28:23,442
I can keep a secret.

640
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,383
Your dad asked me to keep
a secret for him. And I never...

641
00:28:29,363 --> 00:28:31,003
What secret did my dad ask you to keep?

642
00:28:34,762 --> 00:28:35,762
I promised him.

643
00:28:36,162 --> 00:28:36,962
I can't say.

644
00:28:37,843 --> 00:28:39,802
Then I'll tell you a big secret
about my dad.

645
00:28:40,003 --> 00:28:40,843
I found out myself.

646
00:28:41,123 --> 00:28:43,522
Will you exchange it
for your secret with my dad?

647
00:28:49,762 --> 00:28:50,562
No.

648
00:28:50,883 --> 00:28:52,522
All right. Give me the plaque.

649
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:54,880
The plaque, please.

650
00:29:01,243 --> 00:29:02,642
My dad has a girlfriend.

651
00:29:06,522 --> 00:29:07,590
Will you exchange it now?

652
00:29:10,402 --> 00:29:11,243
That's impossible!

653
00:29:12,843 --> 00:29:14,483
Your dad isn't that kind of man.

654
00:29:17,042 --> 00:29:18,243
You're lying.

655
00:29:18,442 --> 00:29:19,962
You want to trick me into
telling you my secret,

656
00:29:20,042 --> 00:29:21,602
then you will tell me
you're just bluffing,

657
00:29:21,682 --> 00:29:22,482
am I right?

658
00:29:23,323 --> 00:29:24,642
The name of my dad's girlfriend

659
00:29:25,083 --> 00:29:26,083
is Little Lark.

660
00:29:27,642 --> 00:29:28,442
It's a bird's name?

661
00:29:29,522 --> 00:29:30,802
What kind of name is that?

662
00:29:31,363 --> 00:29:34,003
Only you could come up
with such a lousy trick.

663
00:29:35,003 --> 00:29:35,803
Unbelievable.

664
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:38,762
Who told you to hang it up?

665
00:29:39,303 --> 00:29:40,103
Take it down!

666
00:29:43,595 --> 00:29:44,948
Didn't you ask us to hang it up?

667
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:47,203
Take it down first.

668
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:49,962
Take it down!

669
00:29:52,723 --> 00:29:54,123
I'm not worthy of this plaque.

670
00:29:55,883 --> 00:29:57,562
One must be cautious
and restrain oneself.

671
00:29:58,003 --> 00:29:59,603
Wu Cheng En said that.

672
00:30:05,483 --> 00:30:06,843
I can cure others' illnesses,

673
00:30:07,522 --> 00:30:08,802
but I can't change their fate.

674
00:30:09,282 --> 00:30:10,842
Madam Jiang recovered

675
00:30:10,922 --> 00:30:12,723
because of a change in her mindset.

676
00:30:13,003 --> 00:30:14,482
I cure someone's illness,

677
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:16,121
and the next day they come back again.

678
00:30:16,522 --> 00:30:17,562
They keep revolving

679
00:30:17,642 --> 00:30:18,922
in this cycle.

680
00:30:19,123 --> 00:30:19,923
Zhu Chang Ming.

681
00:30:20,522 --> 00:30:21,642
Zhu Chang Ming is like that.

682
00:30:22,042 --> 00:30:24,723
If someone wants to break free
from this cycle,

683
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,040
they have to rely on
their own willpower

684
00:30:27,123 --> 00:30:30,003
and change their past habits, you know?

685
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:32,282
The reason I won't accept this plaque

686
00:30:33,042 --> 00:30:34,468
is because it's stolen achievement,

687
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,835
taking credit for someone else's work.

688
00:30:41,282 --> 00:30:43,188
Then why did you accept it
in the first place?

689
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:46,243
Even if my EQ was low,

690
00:30:46,363 --> 00:30:47,483
I wouldn't refuse.

691
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,321
It was a congratulatory gift
given to me when I started my business.

692
00:30:50,402 --> 00:30:52,442
How about this?
I'll place it behind the chair.

693
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,362
This way, it won't disappoint
the elderly who gave it to you,

694
00:30:54,443 --> 00:30:56,003
and it won't bother you.

695
00:30:59,523 --> 00:31:00,363
Just leave it there.

696
00:31:10,522 --> 00:31:11,322
Tou Tou.

697
00:31:19,583 --> 00:31:20,383
We have left

698
00:31:21,483 --> 00:31:22,883
your fate in your hands now.

699
00:31:23,916 --> 00:31:25,036
Success or failure,

700
00:31:26,136 --> 00:31:27,082
it all depends on you.

701
00:31:33,883 --> 00:31:34,683
Master,

702
00:31:35,603 --> 00:31:36,803
I used to dismiss phrases

703
00:31:36,883 --> 00:31:39,003
like "hard work can
change your destiny".

704
00:31:39,762 --> 00:31:41,883
Because delivery riders like us,

705
00:31:42,363 --> 00:31:43,483
we work hard,

706
00:31:44,042 --> 00:31:44,842
but I haven't

707
00:31:45,762 --> 00:31:47,762
seen anyone skyrocket to success.

708
00:31:54,483 --> 00:31:55,283
But I

709
00:31:56,883 --> 00:31:57,683
believe it now.

710
00:31:59,775 --> 00:32:00,735
I really believe it now.

711
00:32:02,282 --> 00:32:03,603
Because I see Zhu Xia,

712
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:04,763
Madam Jiang,

713
00:32:05,422 --> 00:32:06,262
and Cheng Ying,

714
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:09,123
they are all making efforts
to change their own destiny.

715
00:32:09,963 --> 00:32:11,643
They are still dealt a bad hand,

716
00:32:11,723 --> 00:32:12,523
but

717
00:32:14,003 --> 00:32:15,162
they haven't given up

718
00:32:16,363 --> 00:32:17,483
and continue to persist.

719
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:19,723
So I feel that

720
00:32:20,003 --> 00:32:21,283
since I have

721
00:32:21,363 --> 00:32:23,363
a high starting point now,
I am also a successor.

722
00:32:24,522 --> 00:32:25,322
I think...

723
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,600
I can make it.

724
00:32:37,123 --> 00:32:37,923
Right?

725
00:32:52,723 --> 00:32:54,523
-It smells so nice.
-I know, right?

726
00:32:54,603 --> 00:32:56,642
Wine is the essence of food.

727
00:32:56,963 --> 00:33:00,483
Pour some more.
We have two good news today.

728
00:33:01,243 --> 00:33:03,123
We should drink a lot of wine.

729
00:33:03,883 --> 00:33:06,403
Dad, where did we get two good news?

730
00:33:06,483 --> 00:33:08,363
-That's right.
-I regained

731
00:33:08,642 --> 00:33:10,162
my house,

732
00:33:10,642 --> 00:33:12,003
that's the first good news.

733
00:33:13,762 --> 00:33:16,363
The apprentice class reopened,

734
00:33:16,963 --> 00:33:18,723
that's the second good news.

735
00:33:19,282 --> 00:33:20,728
We should celebrate and drink a lot.

736
00:33:21,723 --> 00:33:22,523
Master,

737
00:33:23,243 --> 00:33:24,162
Ling Lan

738
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:26,082
never thought of selling your house.

739
00:33:26,162 --> 00:33:27,123
If she wanted to sell,

740
00:33:27,203 --> 00:33:28,723
it would be our house,

741
00:33:29,243 --> 00:33:31,243
but she didn't tell you on purpose.

742
00:33:31,522 --> 00:33:32,723
She wanted to make you worry.

743
00:33:35,003 --> 00:33:35,803
Master,

744
00:33:37,363 --> 00:33:38,682
let me toast to you.

745
00:33:38,762 --> 00:33:39,883
I'd like to thank you

746
00:33:40,123 --> 00:33:42,283
for your contribution towards TCM,

747
00:33:42,363 --> 00:33:44,562
and for your kindness and care

748
00:33:44,642 --> 00:33:45,522
towards me.

749
00:33:47,762 --> 00:33:49,842
-Maybe I should kowtow to you as well.
-No, no!

750
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,283
This is nonsense.

751
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:53,442
You're toasting to me

752
00:33:53,522 --> 00:33:54,523
and kowtowing to me.

753
00:33:54,603 --> 00:33:56,283
-Are you jinxing me?
-No, no.

754
00:33:56,363 --> 00:33:57,282
You should raise

755
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,040
a toast to my wife instead.

756
00:33:59,123 --> 00:34:00,803
She's a remarkable woman.

757
00:34:00,883 --> 00:34:02,962
Yes, let me kowtow to her.

758
00:34:03,042 --> 00:34:04,402
No, no.

759
00:34:05,201 --> 00:34:06,681
Both of us are getting old.

760
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,440
In the future, the one who will
support you and help you

761
00:34:09,522 --> 00:34:11,042
is your spouse.

762
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,240
Ling Lan has gone through a lot.

763
00:34:13,323 --> 00:34:14,509
Should I kowtow to Ling Lan?

764
00:34:15,562 --> 00:34:16,962
I will thank you then.

765
00:34:17,042 --> 00:34:18,208
I will kowtow to you later.

766
00:34:18,363 --> 00:34:20,403
Thank you for staying by my side
all these years,

767
00:34:20,483 --> 00:34:22,042
even though I'm not

768
00:34:22,483 --> 00:34:23,763
-a capable man.
-Drink up!

769
00:34:32,843 --> 00:34:33,922
I'm toasting along.

770
00:34:34,162 --> 00:34:35,442
Just one glass.

771
00:34:37,883 --> 00:34:40,603
Who just said he was going
to kowtow to me?

772
00:34:42,562 --> 00:34:43,362
Go on.

773
00:34:43,762 --> 00:34:45,322
I already kowtowed to you in my heart.

774
00:34:50,169 --> 00:34:51,648
Don't sigh.

775
00:34:58,802 --> 00:35:00,723
Every day when I look at you at home,

776
00:35:01,236 --> 00:35:02,996
I feel so frustrated.

777
00:35:04,363 --> 00:35:05,163
How did I

778
00:35:05,802 --> 00:35:07,722
end up marrying a husband

779
00:35:07,802 --> 00:35:10,282
who isn't strong,

780
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,760
doesn't make a lot of money

781
00:35:12,042 --> 00:35:14,243
and always causes trouble outside?

782
00:35:15,042 --> 00:35:16,522
My life is so miserable.

783
00:35:18,363 --> 00:35:19,323
But,

784
00:35:20,483 --> 00:35:21,283
Professor Ren,

785
00:35:22,042 --> 00:35:24,323
you know, when you were
lecturing on stage,

786
00:35:25,922 --> 00:35:27,202
when I looked at you up there,

787
00:35:28,162 --> 00:35:29,562
I still admired you.

788
00:35:31,603 --> 00:35:32,642
I mean it.

789
00:35:33,162 --> 00:35:34,642
I'm not joking.

790
00:35:34,802 --> 00:35:35,602
You see,

791
00:35:35,802 --> 00:35:38,243
people like you,

792
00:35:39,323 --> 00:35:40,243
who still

793
00:35:41,323 --> 00:35:42,723
have such passion,

794
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:44,802
are selflessly and

795
00:35:45,163 --> 00:35:46,603
wholeheartedly devoted to TCM.

796
00:35:46,683 --> 00:35:47,776
You would even die for...

797
00:35:48,083 --> 00:35:49,043
No, I mean...

798
00:35:49,123 --> 00:35:50,163
Master, she's jinxing you.

799
00:35:50,363 --> 00:35:52,202
Conquer death and turn things around.

800
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,080
I mean,

801
00:35:55,562 --> 00:35:57,722
you see, you truly

802
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:01,523
dedicate yourself to TCM,
with unwavering focus

803
00:36:01,603 --> 00:36:03,442
and the willingness...

804
00:36:03,522 --> 00:36:05,883
The willingness to sacrifice
your personal life and career.

805
00:36:06,123 --> 00:36:08,323
Not many people can do what you've done.

806
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:11,163
I truly admire you
from the bottom of my heart.

807
00:36:12,002 --> 00:36:12,802
Here's to you.

808
00:36:14,163 --> 00:36:15,896
Does that mean you won't
scold me anymore in the future?

809
00:36:17,323 --> 00:36:18,903
Finish this drink, and I'll answer you.

810
00:36:19,083 --> 00:36:20,522
-Here.
-Drink up.

811
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,280
Dad!

812
00:36:27,722 --> 00:36:29,260
I'm toasting along again. Just one.

813
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:32,482
-Unbelievable.
-I'll answer you now.

814
00:36:33,363 --> 00:36:34,163
In the future,

815
00:36:34,482 --> 00:36:36,323
don't keep hovering around me
all the time.

816
00:36:36,722 --> 00:36:38,882
Just stand on that podium

817
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,720
and give your lectures
with all your dedication.

818
00:36:40,802 --> 00:36:41,883
I believe that way

819
00:36:42,323 --> 00:36:43,482
we can maintain

820
00:36:43,562 --> 00:36:45,802
a stable marital relationship.

821
00:36:46,722 --> 00:36:49,248
Dad, she won't scold you anymore.
She will scold me instead.

822
00:36:49,562 --> 00:36:50,603
It's not the same.

823
00:36:51,578 --> 00:36:53,403
Son, let me tell you the truth.

824
00:36:53,562 --> 00:36:55,762
Actually, every time after I scold you,

825
00:36:55,883 --> 00:36:58,002
I feel really guilty inside.

826
00:36:58,883 --> 00:36:59,762
Because I think

827
00:37:00,083 --> 00:37:01,242
you are an angel

828
00:37:01,562 --> 00:37:03,403
sent to me by God.

829
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:05,510
But

830
00:37:05,802 --> 00:37:07,403
every time after I scold your dad,

831
00:37:07,643 --> 00:37:09,469
I always feel like it's not enough.

832
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:13,323
You see, there's a difference
between someone

833
00:37:13,643 --> 00:37:15,802
who came from your own belly
and someone who didn't.

834
00:37:16,722 --> 00:37:17,722
You're right, Mum.

835
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:18,642
Here's to you.

836
00:37:18,722 --> 00:37:20,203
-Okay.
-Okay.

837
00:37:21,163 --> 00:37:22,842
-Here's to Master.
-Here.

838
00:37:23,802 --> 00:37:25,562
-Master.
-Except for Dad,

839
00:37:26,083 --> 00:37:27,542
the rest of you, raise your glass.

840
00:37:31,802 --> 00:37:32,602
Come on.

841
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,208
Tou Tou, don't drink too much.

842
00:37:35,042 --> 00:37:35,842
Madam.

843
00:37:36,083 --> 00:37:37,242
Master, here's to you.

844
00:37:40,802 --> 00:37:41,802
Meng Meng can't drink.

845
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,240
Yes.

846
00:37:44,002 --> 00:37:44,802
Here.

847
00:37:46,123 --> 00:37:47,722
-Cut it down.
-Meng Meng won't drink.

848
00:37:47,802 --> 00:37:49,243
Just a sip, just a sip.

849
00:37:50,163 --> 00:37:50,963
Look at him!

850
00:37:51,323 --> 00:37:52,363
I'll just have one glass.

851
00:37:53,323 --> 00:37:54,403
It's a nice wine.

852
00:37:58,403 --> 00:38:00,282
-Come on.
-Have some veggies, Mum.

853
00:38:04,083 --> 00:38:04,883
Who is it?

854
00:38:05,042 --> 00:38:05,842
I'll get the door.

855
00:38:07,522 --> 00:38:09,242
You just stay.

856
00:38:12,643 --> 00:38:13,762
Rice cakes!

857
00:38:18,403 --> 00:38:19,203
What brings you here?

858
00:38:26,603 --> 00:38:27,722
Why all of a sudden?

859
00:38:29,282 --> 00:38:31,002
It's not sudden.

860
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,721
Meng Meng has halted
her study for over a year.

861
00:38:33,802 --> 00:38:34,602
Besides,

862
00:38:34,883 --> 00:38:36,923
her recent condition
has been quite good.

863
00:38:37,323 --> 00:38:39,482
We've been thinking about letting
her return to school in September

864
00:38:39,562 --> 00:38:40,603
when the semester resumes.

865
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,180
But she hasn't fully recovered yet.

866
00:38:43,495 --> 00:38:45,615
It would be risky for her
to go back to school now.

867
00:38:46,002 --> 00:38:47,323
We have considered that as well,

868
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,626
that's why we want
to take her home earlier.

869
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,775
We'll let her adapt for a while
according to the school's schedule.

870
00:38:53,722 --> 00:38:54,522
Yes.

871
00:38:55,443 --> 00:38:57,242
Your considerations are very thoughtful.

872
00:38:59,843 --> 00:39:01,042
But rest assured that

873
00:39:01,202 --> 00:39:03,643
we will take her
for regular follow-up appointments.

874
00:39:06,482 --> 00:39:07,802
Thank you, Dr Ren.

875
00:39:08,042 --> 00:39:09,482
And of course, thank you, Dr Song.

876
00:39:09,562 --> 00:39:10,642
Thank you

877
00:39:10,722 --> 00:39:12,403
for always thinking for Meng Meng.

878
00:39:12,762 --> 00:39:14,202
However, Meng Meng

879
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,640
hasn't completed
her high school education yet.

880
00:39:16,722 --> 00:39:19,083
She still needs to study
and gain practical experience

881
00:39:19,403 --> 00:39:21,443
to eventually enter
the workforce on her own.

882
00:39:22,083 --> 00:39:22,883
Yes.

883
00:39:27,762 --> 00:39:28,562
Meng Meng,

884
00:39:29,123 --> 00:39:30,642
after you go home, eat well

885
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,600
and sleep well.

886
00:39:31,802 --> 00:39:33,802
My phone is on all day long.

887
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:34,920
If you need anything,

888
00:39:35,002 --> 00:39:36,522
feel free to call me, okay?

889
00:39:37,482 --> 00:39:38,722
We will also go visit you.

890
00:40:01,443 --> 00:40:02,282
Meng Meng's gone?

891
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,559
She left her doll here.

892
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,160
Sit down and eat first.
You can give it to her tomorrow.

893
00:40:08,242 --> 00:40:09,243
But she left her doll here.

894
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,482
-Give it to her tomorrow.
-No need. She will come back.

895
00:40:21,883 --> 00:40:22,683
Come.

896
00:40:23,282 --> 00:40:25,722
All good things must come to an end.

897
00:40:26,889 --> 00:40:27,729
It is only right

898
00:40:28,323 --> 00:40:30,042
for her to go home.

899
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,480
Come on, let's eat.

900
00:40:34,042 --> 00:40:34,842
Let's eat.

901
00:40:35,123 --> 00:40:35,923
Come on.

902
00:41:00,482 --> 00:41:01,282
You know,

903
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,679
Meng Meng is usually quiet

904
00:41:03,802 --> 00:41:05,083
and is barely invisible,

905
00:41:06,123 --> 00:41:07,242
but now that she's gone,

906
00:41:10,083 --> 00:41:11,683
it just feels like something is missing.

907
00:41:49,643 --> 00:41:51,482
Room service.

908
00:41:51,562 --> 00:41:52,509
I don't want any food.

909
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:56,242
Will you help me check
my TikTok account?

910
00:42:00,083 --> 00:42:01,283
My dear grandson,

911
00:42:01,363 --> 00:42:03,043
my account is unusable now.

912
00:42:03,196 --> 00:42:04,035
It's killing me.

913
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,441
Come on, help me.

914
00:42:05,802 --> 00:42:06,722
Come on.

915
00:42:13,762 --> 00:42:15,123
I'm here to serve you dinner.

916
00:42:16,002 --> 00:42:18,482
Aren't I considerate, my master?

917
00:42:20,722 --> 00:42:21,722
Grandpa, I told you,

918
00:42:21,802 --> 00:42:23,282
I'm not in the mood
to eat anything.

919
00:42:30,522 --> 00:42:31,322
You see,

920
00:42:31,843 --> 00:42:33,083
you have lost your appetite

921
00:42:33,762 --> 00:42:34,843
and you seem down.

922
00:42:35,722 --> 00:42:36,762
You must be sick.

923
00:42:37,083 --> 00:42:37,883
I'm not sick.

924
00:42:40,623 --> 00:42:42,222
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

925
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:43,703
(are referenced from relevant
traditional Chinese medicine books)
