00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,838
(Gen Z)

2
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,800
(Episode 13)

3
00:01:39,707 --> 00:01:42,348
It's really hard for those of us

4
00:01:43,147 --> 00:01:45,067
who are trying to pass on the knowledge.

5
00:01:46,427 --> 00:01:47,628
The Taoist preaches

6
00:01:48,107 --> 00:01:49,227
that a master seeks out his disciple.

7
00:01:49,708 --> 00:01:51,227
I agreed to give a lecture

8
00:01:52,188 --> 00:01:53,547
not for you

9
00:01:54,227 --> 00:01:55,867
but for myself.

10
00:01:56,787 --> 00:01:57,428
I think

11
00:01:58,348 --> 00:01:59,428
that if I give more lectures,

12
00:01:59,668 --> 00:02:01,828
I will eventually get a student

13
00:02:02,867 --> 00:02:04,348
who is willing to pass on all this

14
00:02:04,627 --> 00:02:07,028
without changing the teacher's way.

15
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:09,188
If that's the case,

16
00:02:09,668 --> 00:02:10,467
then I

17
00:02:10,988 --> 00:02:13,028
will be able to answer

18
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:14,708
to my own master.

19
00:02:15,747 --> 00:02:17,467
As long as there's a desire to do so,

20
00:02:17,828 --> 00:02:19,267
it'll work.

21
00:02:22,107 --> 00:02:23,747
Well said.

22
00:02:41,748 --> 00:02:42,668
You can eat beef, right?

23
00:02:43,668 --> 00:02:44,388
Yes.

24
00:02:45,827 --> 00:02:47,468
I'm coming!

25
00:02:47,468 --> 00:02:48,827
You're so slow.

26
00:02:49,348 --> 00:02:50,748
What? Didn't we say to meet at 7pm?

27
00:02:50,748 --> 00:02:51,507
Look at the time now.

28
00:02:51,507 --> 00:02:52,468
I took the time to get changed.

29
00:02:52,468 --> 00:02:52,947
We're here!

30
00:02:52,947 --> 00:02:53,587
You're so slow.

31
00:02:53,587 --> 00:02:53,988
Tian Zhen!

32
00:02:53,988 --> 00:02:54,627
Coming.

33
00:02:54,827 --> 00:02:55,187
What's more?

34
00:02:55,187 --> 00:02:55,988
You haven't placed an order yet?

35
00:02:55,988 --> 00:02:56,547
We haven't.

36
00:02:56,547 --> 00:02:57,267
Let me do it.

37
00:02:57,627 --> 00:02:58,068
We're here.

38
00:02:58,827 --> 00:02:59,507
Tian Zhen,

39
00:02:59,627 --> 00:03:00,307
you're so slow.

40
00:03:00,307 --> 00:03:01,148
Very slow.

41
00:03:01,468 --> 00:03:02,348
I'm not the one who's slow.

42
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:02,668
You're late.

43
00:03:02,668 --> 00:03:03,267
I need to...

44
00:03:03,547 --> 00:03:04,388
There is seafood.

45
00:03:04,388 --> 00:03:05,668
I had to wait for Meng Meng
to get changed.

46
00:03:05,907 --> 00:03:06,547
Seriously.

47
00:03:06,547 --> 00:03:07,028
Fine then.

48
00:03:07,028 --> 00:03:07,907
What would you like to eat?

49
00:03:07,907 --> 00:03:08,907
Their crayfish are good.

50
00:03:10,547 --> 00:03:11,108
Miss,

51
00:03:11,748 --> 00:03:12,187
well,

52
00:03:12,187 --> 00:03:13,348
we want crayfish.

53
00:03:13,547 --> 00:03:15,307
You have a lot of seafood.

54
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:15,867
Yes.

55
00:03:15,867 --> 00:03:17,307
Our seafood is very fresh.

56
00:03:17,307 --> 00:03:18,428
Give me more seafood then.

57
00:03:18,428 --> 00:03:18,708
Okay.

58
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:19,028
Alright?

59
00:03:19,028 --> 00:03:19,468
Sure.

60
00:03:19,468 --> 00:03:20,708
Just prepare according to
the number of people we have.

61
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:22,187
What else do you want?

62
00:03:22,388 --> 00:03:23,947
That's why we came early.

63
00:03:24,227 --> 00:03:25,307
The point is that you
haven't ordered any food.

64
00:03:25,627 --> 00:03:26,468
I was waiting for you.

65
00:03:26,468 --> 00:03:27,267
Because you're late.

66
00:03:27,267 --> 00:03:28,547
The seafood here is not bad.

67
00:03:28,547 --> 00:03:30,187
So many, so fresh.

68
00:03:30,187 --> 00:03:30,668
Tou Tou.

69
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:31,547
I went to a lot of trouble
to find this spot.

70
00:03:31,907 --> 00:03:33,547
What took you so long?

71
00:03:35,108 --> 00:03:36,148
If it wasn't for Little Green,

72
00:03:36,148 --> 00:03:37,187
I wouldn't have been able to make it.

73
00:03:37,187 --> 00:03:38,148
What's the matter? The battery is dead?

74
00:03:38,148 --> 00:03:38,547
Hello.

75
00:03:38,547 --> 00:03:39,148
Hi, Xing Xing.

76
00:03:39,468 --> 00:03:40,267
Sit down.

77
00:03:40,267 --> 00:03:41,187
You can catch up here.

78
00:03:42,108 --> 00:03:42,947
Do you want sliced buns?

79
00:03:42,947 --> 00:03:43,467
Yes.

80
00:03:44,387 --> 00:03:44,868
Miss,

81
00:03:45,467 --> 00:03:46,627
two skewers of sliced buns.

82
00:03:46,627 --> 00:03:47,267
Make it three!

83
00:03:47,267 --> 00:03:47,667
I want one.

84
00:03:47,667 --> 00:03:48,027
Do you want some?

85
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:48,747
I want one too.

86
00:03:48,747 --> 00:03:49,148
Meng Meng wants it too.

87
00:03:49,148 --> 00:03:50,107
Four, five. Five skewers!

88
00:03:50,107 --> 00:03:50,547
Five.

89
00:04:08,187 --> 00:04:08,907
Why is someone in here?

90
00:04:09,747 --> 00:04:10,467
Tou Tou.

91
00:04:11,027 --> 00:04:12,027
I can't hold back any longer.

92
00:04:12,308 --> 00:04:13,508
It will probably take a while.

93
00:04:13,508 --> 00:04:14,267
Wait for a while.

94
00:04:14,267 --> 00:04:15,148
No, this...

95
00:04:17,467 --> 00:04:17,988
Zhao Li Quan,

96
00:04:17,988 --> 00:04:18,907
can you hurry up?

97
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:20,228
I can't take it anymore.

98
00:04:20,547 --> 00:04:21,667
I'm on my fifth trip here.

99
00:04:21,907 --> 00:04:22,428
Tou Tou,

100
00:04:22,667 --> 00:04:23,467
it's all your fault.

101
00:04:23,467 --> 00:04:24,148
If it wasn't for you,

102
00:04:24,148 --> 00:04:25,267
would I have gone to
the toilet so many times?

103
00:04:25,267 --> 00:04:25,907
No, what do you mean by...

104
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:28,827
How could you blame me for this?

105
00:04:28,827 --> 00:04:29,827
Why didn't you thank me

106
00:04:29,827 --> 00:04:30,988
when you were eating so happily?

107
00:04:30,988 --> 00:04:31,667
Listen,

108
00:04:31,667 --> 00:04:32,868
you asked for it.

109
00:04:32,868 --> 00:04:34,148
I didn't force you to come!

110
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:35,308
Open the door now!

111
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:35,988
Alright.

112
00:04:35,988 --> 00:04:36,948
I asked for it.

113
00:04:37,547 --> 00:04:38,387
I couldn't care less.

114
00:04:38,387 --> 00:04:40,428
I need to poop in the field.

115
00:04:41,387 --> 00:04:42,148
Field?

116
00:04:43,667 --> 00:04:44,588
Quick.

117
00:04:44,588 --> 00:04:45,428
I can't hold back any longer.

118
00:04:45,588 --> 00:04:46,228
I can't hold back any longer.

119
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:47,627
I know.

120
00:05:13,588 --> 00:05:15,228
Tou Tou is calling me at this late hour.

121
00:05:15,588 --> 00:05:16,827
Isn't she downstairs?

122
00:05:17,827 --> 00:05:19,428
The kids aren't back yet.

123
00:05:22,627 --> 00:05:23,107
Hello.

124
00:05:23,348 --> 00:05:24,667
(Hello, Niece-in-law.)

125
00:05:24,827 --> 00:05:25,708
Come over now.

126
00:05:25,988 --> 00:05:27,027
We're all dead.

127
00:05:27,428 --> 00:05:28,428
We're all dead.

128
00:05:43,107 --> 00:05:43,868
No, I can't take it anymore.

129
00:05:43,868 --> 00:05:44,588
I'm dying.

130
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:46,547
I can't take it. I'm dying.

131
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:49,907
I'm dying.

132
00:05:51,588 --> 00:05:52,827
I'm dying.

133
00:05:52,868 --> 00:05:54,507
How are you doing? Any better?

134
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:55,787
I can't take it.

135
00:05:55,787 --> 00:05:56,547
You won't die.

136
00:05:58,308 --> 00:06:00,547
Something is definitely wrong
with the seafood today.

137
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:02,708
I didn't have such severe diarrhoea

138
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:04,387
when I took gutter oil before.

139
00:06:04,588 --> 00:06:05,588
Something must be wrong
with it.

140
00:06:08,308 --> 00:06:09,468
Did someone force you to eat it?

141
00:06:14,267 --> 00:06:17,267
You've all got food poisoning.

142
00:06:17,468 --> 00:06:19,267
You should all drink
your herbal medicine later.

143
00:06:19,468 --> 00:06:20,107
Ms Song,

144
00:06:20,748 --> 00:06:22,067
we have a bacterial infection.

145
00:06:22,308 --> 00:06:23,188
Let's not resist it.

146
00:06:23,827 --> 00:06:25,428
We'll be well tomorrow
if we get the antibiotics.

147
00:06:25,428 --> 00:06:26,347
If we take the herbal medicine,

148
00:06:26,908 --> 00:06:28,188
how many days
will it take to get better?

149
00:06:28,468 --> 00:06:29,748
You can leave it out.

150
00:06:29,988 --> 00:06:31,468
You can treat it with Western medicine.

151
00:06:35,148 --> 00:06:36,267
I have something to say.

152
00:06:37,148 --> 00:06:38,387
I have something to say.

153
00:06:38,547 --> 00:06:39,308
You're already in such a state,

154
00:06:39,308 --> 00:06:39,988
what else do you want to say?

155
00:06:39,988 --> 00:06:40,748
You can say it tomorrow.

156
00:06:40,748 --> 00:06:43,308
I can't wait till tomorrow.

157
00:06:44,868 --> 00:06:46,507
I saw the skeleton patient

158
00:06:46,868 --> 00:06:48,588
at the barbecue stall today.

159
00:06:49,428 --> 00:06:50,387
That

160
00:06:50,667 --> 00:06:51,988
skinny guy

161
00:06:52,868 --> 00:06:54,267
who came in

162
00:06:54,267 --> 00:06:55,988
with you guys today.

163
00:07:01,188 --> 00:07:04,188
Since we have such severe diarrhoea,

164
00:07:04,188 --> 00:07:06,308
he ordered a table full of seafood

165
00:07:06,628 --> 00:07:08,428
and judging by his malnourished look,

166
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,468
I'm sure his condition
is even worse now.

167
00:07:09,468 --> 00:07:10,227
Niece-in-law,

168
00:07:10,227 --> 00:07:10,708
Nephew,

169
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:11,547
do you think

170
00:07:11,908 --> 00:07:14,067
you should call and ask?

171
00:07:15,663 --> 00:07:16,708
And Xing Xing.

172
00:07:16,867 --> 00:07:17,628
Xing Xing

173
00:07:17,628 --> 00:07:18,908
needs the medicine too.

174
00:07:19,107 --> 00:07:19,667
What medicine is this?

175
00:07:19,667 --> 00:07:20,148
I don't know.

176
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:20,708
She needs it too.

177
00:07:38,588 --> 00:07:38,988
Here you go.

178
00:07:41,468 --> 00:07:43,148
What smell is this?

179
00:07:43,748 --> 00:07:44,468
Drink it while it's hot.

180
00:07:47,988 --> 00:07:49,267
No, it's too bitter.

181
00:07:49,547 --> 00:07:50,428
It's too bitter.

182
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:51,748
Good medicine tastes bitter.

183
00:07:53,308 --> 00:07:54,468
You have got yourself sick

184
00:07:54,468 --> 00:07:55,628
by indulging

185
00:07:56,148 --> 00:07:57,667
in seafood outside.

186
00:07:58,107 --> 00:08:00,308
I have to stay up to cook you medicine
but you're complaining it's bitter.

187
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:03,148
Don't drink it then.

188
00:08:03,148 --> 00:08:03,908
Put up with the pain then.

189
00:08:03,908 --> 00:08:04,748
Ms Song,

190
00:08:05,308 --> 00:08:06,387
We know we were wrong.

191
00:08:13,428 --> 00:08:14,748
Thank you. I'm sorry.

192
00:08:17,148 --> 00:08:18,308
Alright, finish it quickly.

193
00:08:18,988 --> 00:08:20,507
Get some rest after you've finished it.

194
00:08:24,507 --> 00:08:25,667
I was so scared.

195
00:08:25,868 --> 00:08:28,148
I thought we were doomed this time.

196
00:08:28,148 --> 00:08:30,148
I never thought that
Mr Ren would not scold us.

197
00:08:33,868 --> 00:08:34,588
Guys,

198
00:08:34,787 --> 00:08:36,308
don't mess with your body.

199
00:08:37,387 --> 00:08:38,468
If you can't take it,

200
00:08:39,347 --> 00:08:40,547
just don't take it.

201
00:08:41,308 --> 00:08:41,827
Shi Yan,

202
00:08:42,787 --> 00:08:43,428
keep it.

203
00:08:48,188 --> 00:08:49,067
Every day in class,

204
00:08:49,067 --> 00:08:49,988
the teacher talks about

205
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:51,308
not seeing the world
just from your own point of view

206
00:08:51,308 --> 00:08:52,267
and not being stuck in a rut.

207
00:08:52,267 --> 00:08:53,107
How come you can't figure it out

208
00:08:53,107 --> 00:08:54,547
when you're sick?

209
00:08:54,628 --> 00:08:56,308
Unlike TCM,

210
00:08:56,507 --> 00:08:59,028
Western medicine's greatest
contribution to human longevity

211
00:09:00,227 --> 00:09:01,267
is antibiotics.

212
00:09:01,748 --> 00:09:03,188
The invention of this medicine

213
00:09:03,428 --> 00:09:05,787
has increased human life
expectancy by an average of 20 years.

214
00:09:06,428 --> 00:09:08,748
We have a bacterial infection.

215
00:09:09,628 --> 00:09:10,547
We'll get well

216
00:09:10,547 --> 00:09:11,748
after taking this.

217
00:09:11,947 --> 00:09:13,748
Let's not fight science.

218
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:15,667
I'm not saying

219
00:09:15,947 --> 00:09:17,308
Chinese medicine is bad,

220
00:09:17,308 --> 00:09:18,628
it just takes time.

221
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:20,067
Do you want it or not?

222
00:09:21,188 --> 00:09:21,868
Do you want it?

223
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:28,067
Give me one.

224
00:09:28,748 --> 00:09:29,708
Give me one too.

225
00:09:30,628 --> 00:09:31,188
Tian Zhen.

226
00:09:32,428 --> 00:09:34,107
We may be able to take it as we're men.

227
00:09:34,787 --> 00:09:36,028
Meng Meng is a weak girl.

228
00:09:36,308 --> 00:09:38,428
If something does happen
to her in a few days,

229
00:09:38,428 --> 00:09:39,748
what will you tell her parents?

230
00:09:39,986 --> 00:09:40,468
Meng Meng,

231
00:09:40,868 --> 00:09:41,748
are you still feeling unwell?

232
00:09:44,988 --> 00:09:45,347
Take it.

233
00:09:47,988 --> 00:09:49,308
I think you're quite weak.

234
00:09:49,868 --> 00:09:51,428
Take both of these medicines,

235
00:09:52,227 --> 00:09:53,308
there is always one that works.

236
00:09:55,308 --> 00:09:55,667
Just take it.

237
00:09:56,868 --> 00:09:58,468
Tou Tou, this is for you.

238
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:00,868
No, I will drink Chinese medicine.

239
00:10:02,067 --> 00:10:02,667
Why are you acting like

240
00:10:02,667 --> 00:10:03,787
you're really in it?

241
00:10:04,188 --> 00:10:05,347
Do you really think
you're the successor?

242
00:10:05,628 --> 00:10:06,148
Alright.

243
00:10:06,428 --> 00:10:07,347
Even if you are the successor,

244
00:10:07,347 --> 00:10:09,068
don't mess with your life.

245
00:10:09,547 --> 00:10:11,347
No, what's wrong with you guys?

246
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:16,068
My nephew took our pulse
and prescribed the medicine,

247
00:10:16,068 --> 00:10:17,748
and my niece-in-law
brewed the medicine herself.

248
00:10:18,948 --> 00:10:19,948
Aren't you ashamed
of wasting their efforts?

249
00:10:21,347 --> 00:10:22,268
Are you not ashamed?

250
00:10:22,628 --> 00:10:23,587
But I am.

251
00:10:24,428 --> 00:10:25,107
No one has ever been

252
00:10:25,107 --> 00:10:26,107
this nice to me in my whole life.

253
00:10:26,988 --> 00:10:27,748
Listen,

254
00:10:28,308 --> 00:10:29,147
I'll drink this medicine

255
00:10:29,388 --> 00:10:31,188
even if it doesn't work.

256
00:10:32,347 --> 00:10:32,948
I admire you.

257
00:10:33,308 --> 00:10:34,748
There is really someone who wants
to risk her life to repay a favour.

258
00:10:34,748 --> 00:10:36,508
Alright, I won't persuade you anymore.

259
00:10:36,988 --> 00:10:38,107
I can help you with something else.

260
00:10:38,107 --> 00:10:39,107
If you're dead...

261
00:10:39,107 --> 00:10:40,988
Won't it be too late to
take antibiotics then?

262
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:42,227
That's not what I meant.

263
00:10:42,948 --> 00:10:44,547
I have a friend at the crematorium,

264
00:10:44,547 --> 00:10:45,428
I can help you jump the queue

265
00:10:46,667 --> 00:10:47,388
and get burnt first.

266
00:10:47,428 --> 00:10:48,188
I'll burn...

267
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:49,748
I'll burn you first.

268
00:10:49,748 --> 00:10:50,748
Jump the queue for what?

269
00:11:04,667 --> 00:11:05,428
Look here, everyone.

270
00:11:05,988 --> 00:11:07,907
For my nephew and niece-in-law,

271
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:09,428
I'll finish it.

272
00:11:30,227 --> 00:11:31,508
What a pleasure!

273
00:11:42,907 --> 00:11:43,628
Tou,

274
00:11:43,707 --> 00:11:44,907
you're amazing.

275
00:11:45,068 --> 00:11:46,748
I feel sick to my stomach
at the smell of oil now.

276
00:11:49,188 --> 00:11:50,068
The wild species

277
00:11:50,068 --> 00:11:51,787
is really different from us.

278
00:11:52,428 --> 00:11:53,907
Attacked by Schrodinger's diarrhoea,

279
00:11:53,988 --> 00:11:55,628
Tou is still the toughest.

280
00:11:56,268 --> 00:11:56,667
No,

281
00:11:56,907 --> 00:11:58,907
what is Schrodinger's diarrhoea?

282
00:11:59,068 --> 00:12:00,188
Something you can't verify.

283
00:12:00,308 --> 00:12:01,828
You don't know whether it's Chinese

284
00:12:01,828 --> 00:12:02,667
or Western medicine

285
00:12:02,667 --> 00:12:03,748
that works faster.

286
00:12:04,868 --> 00:12:06,107
The samples differ.

287
00:12:07,868 --> 00:12:08,948
You reap what you sow.

288
00:12:09,308 --> 00:12:11,907
If you were to drink the medicine with
me, you would have been well by now.

289
00:12:12,948 --> 00:12:13,347
Tou,

290
00:12:13,347 --> 00:12:14,188
let me put it to you seriously.

291
00:12:14,188 --> 00:12:15,787
You must not spread the word

292
00:12:15,787 --> 00:12:17,347
that you have cured your
diarrhoea by taking Chinese medicine

293
00:12:18,107 --> 00:12:19,667
to avoid killing people.

294
00:12:20,188 --> 00:12:21,227
Many people don't understand,

295
00:12:21,227 --> 00:12:22,748
so they take small probabilities

296
00:12:23,107 --> 00:12:24,667
as facts.

297
00:12:24,667 --> 00:12:25,988
Tou has such a strong body.

298
00:12:25,988 --> 00:12:26,948
She heals herself

299
00:12:27,107 --> 00:12:28,188
without Chinese medicine.

300
00:12:28,988 --> 00:12:29,868
You don't even know

301
00:12:30,188 --> 00:12:32,227
that Tou has a steel mill
in her belly, right?

302
00:12:32,748 --> 00:12:33,868
She can turn wire

303
00:12:33,868 --> 00:12:35,227
into steel flakes in her belly.

304
00:12:38,667 --> 00:12:39,587
What did your father

305
00:12:39,587 --> 00:12:40,107
call us here for today?

306
00:12:40,787 --> 00:12:41,628
I guess it's about Ms Dong's

307
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:42,988
technique class.

308
00:12:42,988 --> 00:12:43,748
Technique class?

309
00:12:46,868 --> 00:12:47,308
Let's go.

310
00:13:11,868 --> 00:13:13,107
Are you all right?

311
00:13:13,988 --> 00:13:14,907
Who else still has diarrhoea?

312
00:13:15,508 --> 00:13:16,068
Mr Ren,

313
00:13:16,227 --> 00:13:17,107
we're all much better

314
00:13:18,347 --> 00:13:18,988
You're all much better?

315
00:13:19,628 --> 00:13:20,068
Alright.

316
00:13:21,308 --> 00:13:23,107
So let's get this straight.

317
00:13:24,188 --> 00:13:24,988
Whose idea was it?

318
00:13:38,868 --> 00:13:39,467
Tian Zhen.

319
00:13:41,347 --> 00:13:41,828
Dad,

320
00:13:42,748 --> 00:13:44,027
everyone just got diarrhoea.

321
00:13:44,068 --> 00:13:45,107
It wasn't that bad.

322
00:13:45,868 --> 00:13:47,027
It wasn't that bad?

323
00:13:48,547 --> 00:13:49,868
You, as a doctor,

324
00:13:50,667 --> 00:13:51,868
violate discipline

325
00:13:52,227 --> 00:13:53,428
with your patients.

326
00:13:53,748 --> 00:13:54,868
Can you be responsible

327
00:13:55,308 --> 00:13:56,308
if anything happens to her?

328
00:14:04,587 --> 00:14:05,467
I am liable

329
00:14:05,467 --> 00:14:06,628
if any of you

330
00:14:07,188 --> 00:14:08,467
have a problem.

331
00:14:12,707 --> 00:14:14,347
I have worked so hard

332
00:14:14,347 --> 00:14:16,628
to pass on my knowledge,

333
00:14:17,748 --> 00:14:19,467
how could I raise such

334
00:14:19,467 --> 00:14:21,068
ungrateful students?

335
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:25,027
God is watching us.

336
00:14:25,347 --> 00:14:26,508
You guys

337
00:14:27,147 --> 00:14:29,508
are the hope of Chinese medicine.

338
00:14:29,948 --> 00:14:31,587
How are you worthy of

339
00:14:31,828 --> 00:14:33,027
the word hope?

340
00:14:35,707 --> 00:14:36,707
If all students

341
00:14:36,707 --> 00:14:38,068
were as free

342
00:14:38,068 --> 00:14:39,308
as you are,

343
00:14:39,707 --> 00:14:41,147
Chinese civilization

344
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:43,467
would have been extinguished

345
00:14:43,707 --> 00:14:44,787
like other ancient civilizations.

346
00:14:50,628 --> 00:14:53,227
How many times have I told you

347
00:14:53,628 --> 00:14:55,707
what your routine should be,

348
00:14:55,707 --> 00:14:56,628
what you should do

349
00:14:56,628 --> 00:14:57,868
and what you shouldn't do?

350
00:14:58,508 --> 00:15:00,068
Are you less intelligent

351
00:15:00,068 --> 00:15:01,787
than primary school students?

352
00:15:03,948 --> 00:15:04,948
Why Chinese culture

353
00:15:04,948 --> 00:15:07,268
is about the unity of
knowledge and action?

354
00:15:08,828 --> 00:15:09,907
You know it but you don't do it.

355
00:15:11,068 --> 00:15:12,227
You have learned it

356
00:15:12,508 --> 00:15:13,388
and then ignored it.

357
00:15:13,748 --> 00:15:14,787
All the students

358
00:15:14,787 --> 00:15:16,068
in the apprentice class

359
00:15:16,268 --> 00:15:18,508
appear to be sick now.

360
00:15:18,707 --> 00:15:20,388
How can you

361
00:15:20,748 --> 00:15:21,948
convince others

362
00:15:22,068 --> 00:15:24,268
that Chinese medicine is the
knowledge of health and wellness?

363
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:27,628
Report. I can.

364
00:15:27,628 --> 00:15:28,428
I didn't join them last night.

365
00:15:29,068 --> 00:15:29,707
I'm not talking about you.

366
00:15:33,587 --> 00:15:35,068
I have always

367
00:15:36,828 --> 00:15:37,948
believed that

368
00:15:38,068 --> 00:15:39,188
the passing on of Chinese medicine

369
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,068
is a common goal for us all.

370
00:15:41,308 --> 00:15:42,667
But today, it seems

371
00:15:43,027 --> 00:15:45,068
to be just my wishful thinking.

372
00:15:46,628 --> 00:15:48,907
If you really don't want to do it,

373
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:50,268
if you really don't want to learn it,

374
00:15:50,268 --> 00:15:51,628
then I will stop running

375
00:15:51,628 --> 00:15:52,707
this apprentice class.

376
00:15:54,508 --> 00:15:56,308
You have freed me.

377
00:15:57,628 --> 00:15:58,628
I don't have to

378
00:15:58,628 --> 00:16:00,667
worry about the location
of the classroom

379
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:01,828
for the apprentice class anymore.

380
00:16:03,068 --> 00:16:04,188
Let's free ourselves from each other.

381
00:16:06,268 --> 00:16:07,027
Mr Ren,

382
00:16:07,188 --> 00:16:08,667
it's not fair to me.

383
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:09,988
If they don't fit,

384
00:16:09,988 --> 00:16:11,508
they can leave.

385
00:16:11,508 --> 00:16:12,828
But I have followed

386
00:16:12,828 --> 00:16:15,068
your instructions exactly
from the beginning.

387
00:16:15,068 --> 00:16:15,868
I think I'm a

388
00:16:15,907 --> 00:16:17,707
very qualified and good student.

389
00:16:17,707 --> 00:16:19,467
If the class is discontinued,

390
00:16:19,467 --> 00:16:20,188
you should allow me

391
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:21,308
to continue my studies with you.

392
00:16:21,628 --> 00:16:23,107
On the first day of class,

393
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,628
I told you

394
00:16:25,587 --> 00:16:27,188
that all the students in the class

395
00:16:27,188 --> 00:16:29,107
were mirrors and rulers

396
00:16:29,508 --> 00:16:30,388
to each other.

397
00:16:30,707 --> 00:16:31,828
You saw them doing something wrong.

398
00:16:32,508 --> 00:16:34,388
If I judge you
from their point of view,

399
00:16:34,587 --> 00:16:35,508
you are in the wrong too.

400
00:16:37,467 --> 00:16:38,388
I advised them,

401
00:16:39,027 --> 00:16:40,388
but none of them listened to me.

402
00:16:40,707 --> 00:16:41,508
Now that something has gone wrong,

403
00:16:41,508 --> 00:16:43,107
is it fair to me who is the only person

404
00:16:43,107 --> 00:16:44,508
who hasn't made a mistake

405
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:45,820
to share the blame with them?

406
00:16:50,068 --> 00:16:51,188
Do you think you are right?

407
00:16:52,467 --> 00:16:53,748
So how come they don't listen

408
00:16:53,748 --> 00:16:54,828
to anything you say to them?

409
00:16:56,628 --> 00:16:57,948
You did a PhD, right?

410
00:16:58,787 --> 00:16:59,787
You're a barrister.

411
00:17:00,268 --> 00:17:01,667
Then why don't all your classmates

412
00:17:02,667 --> 00:17:04,667
have any faith in you?

413
00:17:07,508 --> 00:17:09,667
If so, how do you have the
ability to pass on knowledge?

414
00:17:11,147 --> 00:17:12,428
I am not here to learn
about passing on knowledge,

415
00:17:13,787 --> 00:17:15,147
I am here to learn how to save lives.

416
00:17:16,667 --> 00:17:18,388
Sweep the snow from your own doorstep,

417
00:17:18,667 --> 00:17:19,948
don't worry about the frost
on your neighbour's roof.

418
00:17:20,428 --> 00:17:21,107
Master.

419
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,199
Master.

420
00:17:24,547 --> 00:17:25,227
Well...

421
00:17:27,188 --> 00:17:28,227
Yesterday,

422
00:17:29,628 --> 00:17:30,628
I was...

423
00:17:30,628 --> 00:17:32,508
I was the one who
asked everyone to join me.

424
00:17:33,308 --> 00:17:34,107
Because

425
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:36,068
I craved skewers.

426
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:37,107
So I asked them

427
00:17:37,107 --> 00:17:38,188
to join me.

428
00:17:38,508 --> 00:17:40,027
And I was the one who ordered the food.

429
00:17:40,428 --> 00:17:41,027
So I think

430
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:42,907
maybe the food I ordered

431
00:17:42,907 --> 00:17:44,388
was just not clean or something.

432
00:17:44,428 --> 00:17:45,707
You want to take
responsibility for this?

433
00:17:46,268 --> 00:17:47,428
Are you up to it?

434
00:17:47,828 --> 00:17:48,388
Mr Ren,

435
00:17:48,787 --> 00:17:50,027
it was me who gathered everyone there.

436
00:17:50,268 --> 00:17:51,508
It's not Tou's fault alone.

437
00:17:51,667 --> 00:17:52,428
I'm the Class Leader.

438
00:17:53,308 --> 00:17:54,388
I didn't take good care of
my fellow classmates.

439
00:17:55,068 --> 00:17:55,787
It's my responsibility.

440
00:17:57,147 --> 00:17:57,667
Mr Ren,

441
00:17:58,787 --> 00:18:00,068
we all went of our own free will.

442
00:18:00,308 --> 00:18:01,188
I am responsible for that too.

443
00:18:01,707 --> 00:18:03,147
I am willing to be punished together.

444
00:18:03,188 --> 00:18:04,268
Yes.

445
00:18:04,268 --> 00:18:05,707
We all went of our own free will.

446
00:18:09,787 --> 00:18:10,547
A law is violated by a lot of people
and is thus left unenforced instead.

447
00:18:11,188 --> 00:18:11,907
If you want to expel anyone,

448
00:18:12,388 --> 00:18:13,308
you'd better expel all of us.

449
00:18:21,188 --> 00:18:21,787
Master!

450
00:18:27,027 --> 00:18:28,308
It's really me.

451
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:30,667
It's really my responsibility alone.

452
00:18:31,188 --> 00:18:31,907
Master,

453
00:18:32,547 --> 00:18:34,667
don't disband the apprentice class.

454
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:37,828
They can really pass it on

455
00:18:37,828 --> 00:18:39,148
after studying Chinese medicine.

456
00:18:40,067 --> 00:18:41,827
It's the cravings that got me.

457
00:18:41,947 --> 00:18:43,427
I know I've let you down again

458
00:18:43,427 --> 00:18:44,587
by not being good enough.

459
00:18:45,388 --> 00:18:47,307
Why don't you punish me?

460
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:49,227
Okay, Master?

461
00:18:50,307 --> 00:18:51,307
You want to be a heroin?

462
00:18:53,347 --> 00:18:54,187
You want to take the blame

463
00:18:54,187 --> 00:18:55,227
for this, right?

464
00:18:56,067 --> 00:18:56,587
Alright.

465
00:18:58,427 --> 00:18:59,628
I guess my little pond

466
00:18:59,628 --> 00:19:01,668
can't keep a big shark like you anymore.

467
00:19:02,427 --> 00:19:03,587
From now on,

468
00:19:04,508 --> 00:19:06,427
you are no longer a student
of the apprentice class.

469
00:19:07,668 --> 00:19:09,067
You can leave now.

470
00:19:10,788 --> 00:19:11,707
I can't teach you.

471
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:17,548
And I don't know how to teach you!

472
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:22,307
Mum.

473
00:19:38,947 --> 00:19:40,347
Stop following me.

474
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:41,788
You're still at work.

475
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:43,587
Where are you going?

476
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:46,187
I'm going to look for a job.

477
00:19:46,187 --> 00:19:47,508
I can get one at any time.

478
00:19:49,707 --> 00:19:50,827
So where are you going to live?

479
00:19:52,148 --> 00:19:53,827
You can't go back to
Tian Zhen's home anymore.

480
00:19:54,268 --> 00:19:55,548
How about this?

481
00:19:55,548 --> 00:19:57,427
You can move back in with Xing Xing.

482
00:19:57,508 --> 00:19:58,268
I'll move my stuff out,

483
00:19:58,268 --> 00:19:59,427
I can't take up your space.

484
00:20:00,067 --> 00:20:01,628
Zhao Li Quan, are you a fool?

485
00:20:02,427 --> 00:20:03,427
You've finally got a place
to settle down.

486
00:20:03,427 --> 00:20:04,947
Just live there in peace.

487
00:20:05,307 --> 00:20:06,508
I have a place to live.

488
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:09,628
You're not fooling me?

489
00:20:10,587 --> 00:20:11,508
Why should I fool you?

490
00:20:11,508 --> 00:20:12,788
I really have a place to live

491
00:20:13,028 --> 00:20:14,028
and it's a single room.

492
00:20:16,028 --> 00:20:16,908
Listen here.

493
00:20:18,307 --> 00:20:20,427
You are the hope of your whole village

494
00:20:20,668 --> 00:20:21,868
and the talent of the community.

495
00:20:21,868 --> 00:20:22,788
You will be needed

496
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:23,748
in many ways in the future.

497
00:20:24,388 --> 00:20:26,187
You are going to be a great doctor.

498
00:20:26,908 --> 00:20:27,788
Don't stay in

499
00:20:27,788 --> 00:20:29,067
those messy places.

500
00:20:29,707 --> 00:20:30,227
Just live in peace

501
00:20:30,227 --> 00:20:31,668
with Xing Xing.

502
00:20:31,668 --> 00:20:32,587
Don't worry about anything else.

503
00:20:34,427 --> 00:20:35,028
I was

504
00:20:35,028 --> 00:20:37,268
never one of you.

505
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:38,947
So now I'm off

506
00:20:39,868 --> 00:20:41,628
to wander the world with Little Green.

507
00:20:42,427 --> 00:20:43,028
Bye.

508
00:20:44,028 --> 00:20:44,508
Go back.

509
00:21:05,067 --> 00:21:06,988
I think, in life,

510
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:09,028
we deserve to be forgiven

511
00:21:09,427 --> 00:21:10,628
as long as we don't harm
someone on purpose.

512
00:21:11,788 --> 00:21:12,628
Just like me.

513
00:21:12,628 --> 00:21:13,707
Even if I did break someone's bones,

514
00:21:13,707 --> 00:21:15,307
I stood up for what was right.

515
00:21:15,548 --> 00:21:16,268
So you can't include that

516
00:21:16,268 --> 00:21:17,628
in my dark history.

517
00:21:17,947 --> 00:21:21,427
We need to look at
the bright side of life.

518
00:21:22,947 --> 00:21:23,827
Stop blaming yourself.

519
00:21:31,187 --> 00:21:32,227
If I may suggest,

520
00:21:32,548 --> 00:21:33,307
learn medicine from me.

521
00:21:34,908 --> 00:21:35,788
Learn TCM.

522
00:21:36,668 --> 00:21:37,427
I really think

523
00:21:38,021 --> 00:21:39,501
you have a talent for studying TCM.

524
00:21:40,668 --> 00:21:41,268
In TCM,

525
00:21:42,187 --> 00:21:44,307
if you can accurately
identify the illness,

526
00:21:44,908 --> 00:21:45,788
confront it,

527
00:21:46,827 --> 00:21:47,587
defeat it,

528
00:21:47,707 --> 00:21:49,148
and cure the patient's condition,

529
00:21:49,947 --> 00:21:51,148
the sense of accomplishment

530
00:21:51,388 --> 00:21:53,307
is much stronger than catching a doll.

531
00:22:23,307 --> 00:22:24,508
You're really mad?

532
00:22:26,028 --> 00:22:26,548
Here you go.

533
00:22:33,508 --> 00:22:35,467
What's with me?

534
00:22:35,788 --> 00:22:37,628
Why do I have such a student?

535
00:22:38,788 --> 00:22:40,067
It's your disciple.

536
00:22:41,707 --> 00:22:42,748
This is the disciple

537
00:22:42,748 --> 00:22:44,668
God sent you.

538
00:22:44,908 --> 00:22:46,788
Being grateful to God, respecting
teachers and remembering elders.

539
00:22:47,947 --> 00:22:49,788
Your master, who is also my father,

540
00:22:50,668 --> 00:22:52,427
gave you such a tough task

541
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:54,187
and you accepted it,

542
00:22:54,788 --> 00:22:55,427
didn't you?

543
00:22:55,668 --> 00:22:56,908
You can't blame anyone else, can you?

544
00:22:58,307 --> 00:22:59,707
Don't let yourself

545
00:22:59,868 --> 00:23:01,508
get into trouble

546
00:23:01,707 --> 00:23:03,107
when you haven't nurtured a disciple.

547
00:23:08,908 --> 00:23:09,788
It's good that she's left.

548
00:23:12,508 --> 00:23:13,307
It's good that she's left.

549
00:23:14,707 --> 00:23:15,707
I've tried my best.

550
00:23:16,908 --> 00:23:18,067
It's not that I don't want
to nurture her,

551
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:20,148
she won't let me.

552
00:23:22,187 --> 00:23:24,187
She's hopeless.

553
00:23:24,548 --> 00:23:26,628
Enough, I know you well.

554
00:23:27,028 --> 00:23:28,427
Don't take advantage of the issue.

555
00:23:30,788 --> 00:23:31,668
Listen,

556
00:23:32,187 --> 00:23:34,227
today's incident

557
00:23:36,148 --> 00:23:38,028
has really made me

558
00:23:38,707 --> 00:23:40,227
change my view of Tou Tou.

559
00:23:40,908 --> 00:23:41,508
This kid

560
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:42,988
can be nurtured.

561
00:23:45,548 --> 00:23:46,148
I mean it.

562
00:23:47,028 --> 00:23:48,227
Look, she stepped forward

563
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:51,227
to admit her mistake today.

564
00:23:52,028 --> 00:23:53,307
I observed the other kids

565
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:54,508
closely.

566
00:23:54,668 --> 00:23:56,908
In fact, they all looked ashamed.

567
00:23:57,668 --> 00:23:58,908
So she may not be

568
00:23:59,707 --> 00:24:01,748
the one who started it.

569
00:24:06,668 --> 00:24:08,508
Princess Taiping made a mistake,

570
00:24:08,628 --> 00:24:09,427
right?

571
00:24:09,427 --> 00:24:10,628
But she admitted it.

572
00:24:11,148 --> 00:24:12,908
Didn't Wu Zetian also lament

573
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,280
that it was a pity she wasn't a man?

574
00:24:16,187 --> 00:24:18,788
Are you comparing her to a princess?

575
00:24:20,668 --> 00:24:22,668
She's a stubborn monkey.

576
00:24:26,628 --> 00:24:27,947
Since she's a stubborn monkey,

577
00:24:27,947 --> 00:24:29,548
why are you so angry?

578
00:24:32,028 --> 00:24:33,148
You've taken it to heart.

579
00:24:42,548 --> 00:24:43,388
Look,

580
00:24:43,908 --> 00:24:45,587
she had such severe diarrhoea,

581
00:24:45,668 --> 00:24:46,628
she still thought of

582
00:24:47,028 --> 00:24:48,187
those irrelevant people

583
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:49,788
around her.

584
00:24:50,388 --> 00:24:51,307
What does it mean?

585
00:24:52,707 --> 00:24:54,307
It means she is observant and caring.

586
00:24:56,388 --> 00:24:57,628
Of all the students who were there,

587
00:24:58,508 --> 00:24:59,908
how come none of them

588
00:25:00,187 --> 00:25:00,908
noticed that?

589
00:25:00,908 --> 00:25:02,067
What do you mean by this gesture?

590
00:25:02,508 --> 00:25:04,548
You've complimented her twice

591
00:25:04,548 --> 00:25:06,187
for being observant and caring.

592
00:25:14,427 --> 00:25:15,988
If you want to keep her,

593
00:25:16,427 --> 00:25:17,307
call her

594
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:18,508
and get her back.

595
00:25:18,548 --> 00:25:19,187
No.

596
00:25:20,307 --> 00:25:21,427
If she doesn't come back,

597
00:25:21,947 --> 00:25:23,388
this is the end of

598
00:25:23,388 --> 00:25:24,268
our apprenticeship.

599
00:25:29,187 --> 00:25:30,788
Is there a rebellion going on?

600
00:25:31,508 --> 00:25:32,508
There are so many people in the world

601
00:25:32,508 --> 00:25:33,628
who want to be my disciple.

602
00:25:34,427 --> 00:25:35,788
Do I have to beg her?

603
00:25:38,668 --> 00:25:39,628
Is she my grandma?

604
00:25:40,427 --> 00:25:40,947
Yes.

605
00:25:42,827 --> 00:25:43,908
If she doesn't come back, let her be.

606
00:25:44,427 --> 00:25:45,148
Since she's left,

607
00:25:45,548 --> 00:25:47,427
let's stop running this class.

608
00:25:47,628 --> 00:25:50,307
So you can take some money home.

609
00:25:55,028 --> 00:25:56,307
I can't

610
00:25:56,307 --> 00:25:57,467
take money home.

611
00:25:57,668 --> 00:25:58,947
If I could have done that,

612
00:25:59,148 --> 00:26:00,827
you wouldn't have married me.

613
00:26:02,548 --> 00:26:04,508
We have a very clear division of duties.

614
00:26:04,947 --> 00:26:07,028
You are at home dealing
with mundane tasks

615
00:26:07,307 --> 00:26:09,628
while I am out doing good deeds.

616
00:26:10,508 --> 00:26:12,427
Can you tell me what kind of

617
00:26:12,427 --> 00:26:13,827
good deeds you have done?

618
00:26:15,067 --> 00:26:16,148
I teach

619
00:26:16,707 --> 00:26:17,707
and nurture my students.

620
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,120
Treating patients is also a good deed

621
00:26:22,427 --> 00:26:25,587
but there are so many
people in the world.

622
00:26:25,587 --> 00:26:27,628
Even if I were capable,

623
00:26:27,628 --> 00:26:29,427
I wouldn't be able to care so much.

624
00:26:29,628 --> 00:26:30,788
I've thought about it.

625
00:26:30,788 --> 00:26:31,548
Once

626
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:33,307
I've nurtured a great doctor,

627
00:26:33,307 --> 00:26:34,788
I'll have an extra hand.

628
00:26:34,788 --> 00:26:37,388
If I've nurtured 3,000 great doctors,

629
00:26:37,388 --> 00:26:38,187
well...

630
00:26:39,668 --> 00:26:40,908
I haven't seen you

631
00:26:41,107 --> 00:26:43,227
nurture much renowned students

632
00:26:43,227 --> 00:26:45,028
in all these years.

633
00:26:45,307 --> 00:26:46,788
It takes ten years to plant a tree,

634
00:26:47,427 --> 00:26:48,788
but a hundred years to nurture a person.

635
00:26:50,427 --> 00:26:51,947
I haven't lived long enough.

636
00:26:54,148 --> 00:26:55,067
Enough.

637
00:26:56,427 --> 00:26:58,908
My father was absolutely right.

638
00:26:59,427 --> 00:27:00,347
Do you know what God

639
00:27:00,347 --> 00:27:02,028
is asking you to fix?

640
00:27:02,908 --> 00:27:04,148
Pride.

641
00:27:05,028 --> 00:27:07,227
The reason you can't even
let go of your pride today

642
00:27:07,628 --> 00:27:08,947
is because

643
00:27:08,947 --> 00:27:11,028
we have all lost face for you.

644
00:27:14,908 --> 00:27:17,028
When you took all the family's savings

645
00:27:17,187 --> 00:27:18,107
to support

646
00:27:18,148 --> 00:27:19,788
the poor community,

647
00:27:20,187 --> 00:27:21,707
as a married daughter,

648
00:27:21,707 --> 00:27:22,628
I took my son

649
00:27:22,628 --> 00:27:24,187
back to my parents' house for food,

650
00:27:24,427 --> 00:27:25,908
didn't I embarrass myself?

651
00:27:26,268 --> 00:27:27,187
You've said it twice.

652
00:27:29,028 --> 00:27:30,187
Alright.

653
00:27:30,187 --> 00:27:31,347
Okay, I will stop talking about this.

654
00:27:31,827 --> 00:27:32,947
Let's talk about

655
00:27:33,187 --> 00:27:35,028
your resignation.

656
00:27:36,028 --> 00:27:37,908
You're ashamed to
return to the university,

657
00:27:37,908 --> 00:27:38,908
so you asked me to

658
00:27:38,908 --> 00:27:40,307
go and pack your stuff for you.

659
00:27:40,788 --> 00:27:42,067
Did I feel ashamed?

660
00:27:42,427 --> 00:27:43,628
No.

661
00:27:44,307 --> 00:27:45,107
Look,

662
00:27:46,508 --> 00:27:47,628
You let me

663
00:27:47,788 --> 00:27:49,668
do everything you find hard to deal with

664
00:27:50,307 --> 00:27:52,148
for you.

665
00:27:52,628 --> 00:27:53,548
What does it mean?

666
00:27:54,827 --> 00:27:55,707
It means that

667
00:27:55,908 --> 00:27:57,307
God really wants to

668
00:27:57,307 --> 00:27:58,427
smack your pride

669
00:27:59,668 --> 00:28:00,427
on the ground

670
00:28:00,427 --> 00:28:02,868
and rub it off,

671
00:28:03,788 --> 00:28:04,748
just like that.

672
00:28:05,908 --> 00:28:07,268
If you can do it,

673
00:28:07,908 --> 00:28:09,148
you'll break through.

674
00:28:17,548 --> 00:28:18,908
If you

675
00:28:18,908 --> 00:28:21,508
don't want to beg
your disciple to come back,

676
00:28:21,548 --> 00:28:22,427
fine.

677
00:28:22,788 --> 00:28:23,508
You may

678
00:28:24,508 --> 00:28:25,628
ask Liu

679
00:28:25,628 --> 00:28:26,908
to find another classroom for you.

680
00:28:33,187 --> 00:28:34,548
Isn't he just

681
00:28:34,548 --> 00:28:35,788
trying to do something

682
00:28:35,788 --> 00:28:36,947
in your name?

683
00:28:37,628 --> 00:28:39,307
Nowadays, there are

684
00:28:39,427 --> 00:28:41,067
so many people

685
00:28:41,067 --> 00:28:41,988
who do things

686
00:28:41,988 --> 00:28:43,107
in the name of others.

687
00:28:43,548 --> 00:28:44,427
What is this?

688
00:28:45,307 --> 00:28:46,227
Everyone has their own tricks

689
00:28:46,347 --> 00:28:47,587
and ways of dealing with things.

690
00:28:48,307 --> 00:28:49,628
If you don't want to do it,

691
00:28:49,628 --> 00:28:50,548
you can find him

692
00:28:50,548 --> 00:28:51,748
someone who does.

693
00:28:57,668 --> 00:28:59,187
You've got a point here.

694
00:28:59,827 --> 00:29:00,788
He's not really

695
00:29:00,788 --> 00:29:02,067
using my name,

696
00:29:02,067 --> 00:29:03,947
but TCM.

697
00:29:07,187 --> 00:29:07,827
That makes sense.

698
00:29:10,668 --> 00:29:12,788
Looks like God is helping me.

699
00:29:15,148 --> 00:29:16,187
Is God helping you

700
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:17,668
or is your wife helping you?

701
00:29:18,508 --> 00:29:20,028
God's way of helping me

702
00:29:20,028 --> 00:29:21,548
was to let me marry you.

703
00:29:22,908 --> 00:29:23,947
You have said it for the fifth time.

704
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,644
(End of heat)

705
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,992
(means the heat is leaving.)

706
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,448
(It reminds people that
the summer heat is fading)

707
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,080
(and the weather is gradually
transitioning to cooler.)

708
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:54,698
(End of Heat)

709
00:30:07,427 --> 00:30:08,788
Professor Ren,

710
00:30:09,668 --> 00:30:11,347
you're really treating me
to a feast today.

711
00:30:12,148 --> 00:30:14,508
I didn't expect this.

712
00:30:16,067 --> 00:30:17,148
Are you here alone?

713
00:30:19,548 --> 00:30:20,988
Where are those investors?

714
00:30:23,227 --> 00:30:25,148
I'm not sure what you're up to

715
00:30:25,427 --> 00:30:26,908
after being fooled by you so many times.

716
00:30:27,187 --> 00:30:28,227
I am here today

717
00:30:28,227 --> 00:30:29,508
to find out your intentions.

718
00:30:35,508 --> 00:30:36,788
Mr Liu, I've actually

719
00:30:36,788 --> 00:30:37,947
been wondering

720
00:30:38,307 --> 00:30:39,868
if you really

721
00:30:40,548 --> 00:30:41,827
want to invest in TCM?

722
00:30:43,427 --> 00:30:44,748
I don't know anything about it.

723
00:30:44,788 --> 00:30:46,467
So I would like to use your reputation.

724
00:30:46,467 --> 00:30:47,467
But you disagreed.

725
00:30:48,187 --> 00:30:49,508
You want to use my reputation.

726
00:30:49,668 --> 00:30:50,827
I've got two legs.

727
00:30:50,827 --> 00:30:52,067
What if I run away

728
00:30:52,067 --> 00:30:53,268
and your efforts are wasted?

729
00:30:53,427 --> 00:30:54,427
Where are you running to?

730
00:30:55,827 --> 00:30:57,227
Who doesn't know you

731
00:30:57,227 --> 00:30:58,827
as a highly respected TCM practitioner?

732
00:30:58,827 --> 00:30:59,707
Cut the crap.

733
00:31:00,668 --> 00:31:01,148
Besides,

734
00:31:01,148 --> 00:31:02,427
I also have a passion

735
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:03,307
for the promotion

736
00:31:03,307 --> 00:31:05,227
of Chinese medicine

737
00:31:05,508 --> 00:31:06,668
and culture.

738
00:31:10,067 --> 00:31:11,307
I'm not kidding.

739
00:31:11,908 --> 00:31:12,467
Really?

740
00:31:14,788 --> 00:31:15,268
Alright.

741
00:31:16,908 --> 00:31:17,668
I'm relieved now.

742
00:31:20,187 --> 00:31:21,268
To be honest,

743
00:31:21,268 --> 00:31:22,908
I invited you here today

744
00:31:22,908 --> 00:31:24,707
to introduce you

745
00:31:24,707 --> 00:31:26,107
to a highly qualified person

746
00:31:26,307 --> 00:31:27,427
in the industry of TCM.

747
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:29,908
Who is it?

748
00:31:32,707 --> 00:31:33,388
You will know it

749
00:31:33,388 --> 00:31:34,187
when he is here.

750
00:31:35,908 --> 00:31:37,268
Sorry for being late,

751
00:31:37,268 --> 00:31:38,508
I was stuck in traffic.

752
00:31:40,467 --> 00:31:41,187
Let me introduce.

753
00:31:41,187 --> 00:31:43,187
This is the principal of
University of TCM,

754
00:31:43,187 --> 00:31:44,508
Wu Shan Dao.

755
00:31:45,067 --> 00:31:45,427
Mr Wu.

756
00:31:45,427 --> 00:31:46,028
I'm just an acting principal.

757
00:31:46,268 --> 00:31:47,028
An acting principal.

758
00:31:47,028 --> 00:31:47,908
This is

759
00:31:47,908 --> 00:31:51,307
Mr Liu, the owner of
the TCM industrial park.

760
00:31:51,668 --> 00:31:52,868
Mr Liu.

761
00:31:52,908 --> 00:31:53,827
I've heard a lot about you.

762
00:31:54,908 --> 00:31:56,427
You two can talk alone

763
00:31:56,427 --> 00:31:57,908
over a meal later.

764
00:31:58,427 --> 00:31:58,788
Okay.

765
00:31:58,788 --> 00:31:59,548
I am pleased to meet you.

766
00:31:59,788 --> 00:32:00,788
I hope we can work well together.

767
00:32:00,788 --> 00:32:02,187
Thank you.

768
00:32:02,827 --> 00:32:03,347
Have a seat.

769
00:32:03,388 --> 00:32:03,788
Come on.

770
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:04,467
Have a seat.

771
00:32:04,508 --> 00:32:04,868
Have a seat.

772
00:32:04,868 --> 00:32:05,508
Your delivery is here.

773
00:32:05,668 --> 00:32:06,107
Alright.

774
00:32:06,148 --> 00:32:06,908
Well,

775
00:32:07,028 --> 00:32:08,067
I've flown you

776
00:32:08,148 --> 00:32:10,028
matsutake

777
00:32:11,268 --> 00:32:11,947
from Yunnan.

778
00:32:12,427 --> 00:32:13,307
Come in.

779
00:32:13,307 --> 00:32:14,827
Can you tell me the collection...

780
00:32:15,707 --> 00:32:16,427
Collection...

781
00:32:22,827 --> 00:32:23,427
Look.

782
00:32:23,668 --> 00:32:24,107
Collection code.

783
00:32:24,107 --> 00:32:24,908
765558.

784
00:32:26,788 --> 00:32:27,788
There is an extra number, right?

785
00:32:29,067 --> 00:32:30,148
765558.

786
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:30,748
Are my eyes bad

787
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:31,707
or yours?

788
00:32:32,788 --> 00:32:33,788
Three fives and an eight.

789
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:36,268
Okay, I'll leave it here for you.

790
00:32:40,548 --> 00:32:41,988
Tou Tou is working a part-time job.

791
00:32:43,508 --> 00:32:44,427
Do you know it, Senior?

792
00:32:49,827 --> 00:32:50,467
Waiter!

793
00:32:55,187 --> 00:32:55,947
Come in.

794
00:33:03,707 --> 00:33:04,427
Well,

795
00:33:06,668 --> 00:33:07,548
you

796
00:33:08,668 --> 00:33:09,788
haven't been in touch
with Tou Tou lately?

797
00:33:11,427 --> 00:33:12,028
No.

798
00:33:15,548 --> 00:33:17,427
How can you be so cold-hearted?

799
00:33:18,427 --> 00:33:18,988
You don't even know

800
00:33:18,988 --> 00:33:19,827
what she's doing?

801
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:21,827
That's your grandmaster,

802
00:33:21,908 --> 00:33:22,908
your classmate.

803
00:33:24,668 --> 00:33:26,268
She's your senior aunt too,

804
00:33:26,868 --> 00:33:28,148
and also your student.

805
00:33:28,347 --> 00:33:29,227
If you're not cold-hearted,

806
00:33:29,227 --> 00:33:30,508
why ask me?

807
00:33:31,628 --> 00:33:32,107
Right,

808
00:33:32,748 --> 00:33:34,388
you're the one who drove her away.

809
00:33:34,548 --> 00:33:35,947
Since you drove her away,

810
00:33:36,187 --> 00:33:37,548
she is no longer my classmate

811
00:33:37,548 --> 00:33:38,827
or your student.

812
00:33:39,908 --> 00:33:41,427
Isn't it a bit unnecessary for us

813
00:33:41,788 --> 00:33:43,427
to be concerned about her now?

814
00:33:43,427 --> 00:33:45,908
You are going to be a doctor one day.

815
00:33:46,187 --> 00:33:48,028
After all these years of
being nurtured by the family,

816
00:33:48,028 --> 00:33:49,028
you fail at being observant

817
00:33:49,028 --> 00:33:50,227
and caring,

818
00:33:50,307 --> 00:33:51,628
far worse than Tou Tou.

819
00:33:53,827 --> 00:33:54,268
Dad,

820
00:33:54,707 --> 00:33:55,508
if you have something to say,

821
00:33:55,508 --> 00:33:56,548
can you just be straight with me?

822
00:34:01,187 --> 00:34:02,028
Go ahead with your calligraphy.

823
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,360
(Grandson, I have a lot of deliveries
to make today and I will be late.)

824
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,320
(By the way, remember to
bring my skateboard with you).

825
00:34:27,947 --> 00:34:28,788
Roger.

826
00:34:30,148 --> 00:34:31,227
Do you need supper?

827
00:34:33,668 --> 00:34:35,988
You're such a filial grandson.

828
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,138
(You're such a filial grandson.)

829
00:34:54,827 --> 00:34:55,508
Uncle Tao,

830
00:34:56,067 --> 00:34:57,587
why are you still lying in my place?

831
00:34:57,748 --> 00:34:58,548
Let me stay in your room for a while.

832
00:34:58,548 --> 00:34:59,347
I've told you many times.

833
00:34:59,347 --> 00:34:59,988
Help me with massage.

834
00:34:59,988 --> 00:35:01,268
You need to go to the doctor
to check your back.

835
00:35:01,268 --> 00:35:02,868
You can't keep lying on your stomach.

836
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:04,307
It's okay.

837
00:35:04,307 --> 00:35:06,148
I have to take time off work to go
to hospital and it's a waste of time.

838
00:35:06,268 --> 00:35:07,307
You have great massage skills.

839
00:35:07,707 --> 00:35:08,947
Don't you have social insurance?

840
00:35:09,947 --> 00:35:10,707
You wish!

841
00:35:10,947 --> 00:35:13,043
Our company filed our social
insurance in other regions.

842
00:35:13,077 --> 00:35:13,837
(Uncle Tao)

843
00:35:13,947 --> 00:35:15,707
So we can't use it for
medical treatment in Jiangzhou.

844
00:35:17,587 --> 00:35:19,187
But you can't put it off.

845
00:35:19,707 --> 00:35:21,107
I told you I studied medicine.

846
00:35:21,347 --> 00:35:22,628
From my experience,

847
00:35:23,148 --> 00:35:24,148
you're bound to get sick

848
00:35:24,148 --> 00:35:25,628
if you keep putting it off.

849
00:35:25,868 --> 00:35:26,908
Cut the crap.

850
00:35:26,908 --> 00:35:27,628
Stop bragging.

851
00:36:12,348 --> 00:36:13,508
Here are your brush, ink and paper.

852
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:14,348
Remember to bring them along.

853
00:36:15,947 --> 00:36:16,867
Why should I?

854
00:36:17,667 --> 00:36:18,508
Do you think I'll still
be practising calligraphy

855
00:36:18,508 --> 00:36:19,508
when I'm gone?

856
00:36:20,147 --> 00:36:21,068
You can't leave anything

857
00:36:21,068 --> 00:36:22,147
you've used with me either.

858
00:36:22,748 --> 00:36:23,588
If you want to throw them away,
do it yourself.

859
00:37:03,108 --> 00:37:04,947
What are you writing?

860
00:37:09,508 --> 00:37:11,548
Look at your calligraphic writing.

861
00:37:11,748 --> 00:37:12,867
Those who know
will know that you wrote it,

862
00:37:12,867 --> 00:37:13,707
those who don't

863
00:37:13,707 --> 00:37:14,907
will think it's a turtle's footprint.

864
00:37:15,108 --> 00:37:16,667
When others write calligraphy,

865
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:17,588
they...

866
00:37:19,548 --> 00:37:21,147
What are you doing?

867
00:37:24,907 --> 00:37:25,788
I'm talking to you.

868
00:37:26,788 --> 00:37:27,947
What are you doing?

869
00:37:28,028 --> 00:37:28,907
Uncle Tao,

870
00:37:28,988 --> 00:37:29,627
if you have nothing to do here,

871
00:37:29,627 --> 00:37:31,028
you should go back to bed.

872
00:37:31,028 --> 00:37:32,467
I'm doing homework.

873
00:37:32,788 --> 00:37:33,988
This is your homework?

874
00:37:34,227 --> 00:37:35,548
This is the homework my master gave me.

875
00:37:35,667 --> 00:37:36,548
My master told me

876
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:37,748
to practise like this

877
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:38,988
for ten years.

878
00:37:39,108 --> 00:37:40,068
After ten years,

879
00:37:40,068 --> 00:37:41,068
I will be thirty-two years old

880
00:37:41,068 --> 00:37:43,147
and when I write my prescriptions,

881
00:37:43,627 --> 00:37:44,867
my patients will have confidence in me

882
00:37:45,068 --> 00:37:46,348
when I start writing.

883
00:37:46,548 --> 00:37:47,227
Get it?

884
00:37:47,227 --> 00:37:48,348
Stop fooling me.

885
00:37:48,348 --> 00:37:49,867
I don't believe you when you say

886
00:37:49,867 --> 00:37:50,707
you'll be a delivery rider
for ten years,

887
00:37:50,707 --> 00:37:51,788
let alone ten years from now

888
00:37:51,788 --> 00:37:53,227
when you'll be treating patients.

889
00:37:54,988 --> 00:37:55,707
Silly girl,

890
00:37:55,707 --> 00:37:56,548
listen here.

891
00:37:56,907 --> 00:37:58,187
Anyone who promises you

892
00:37:58,187 --> 00:38:00,068
something ten years from now

893
00:38:00,748 --> 00:38:01,988
is a liar.

894
00:38:02,227 --> 00:38:02,748
Remember this.

895
00:38:08,068 --> 00:38:09,308
You're pretty serious.

896
00:38:09,467 --> 00:38:10,548
I think

897
00:38:11,147 --> 00:38:12,348
you are an over-ambitious

898
00:38:12,508 --> 00:38:14,147
small potato.

899
00:38:14,308 --> 00:38:15,508
Just accept your fate.

900
00:38:16,227 --> 00:38:17,548
Even if you've been practising
calligraphy for ten years,

901
00:38:17,548 --> 00:38:18,867
you're still a delivery rider.

902
00:38:19,108 --> 00:38:21,348
What's wrong with still being
a delivery rider in ten years?

903
00:38:22,068 --> 00:38:23,348
That will make a difference.

904
00:38:23,548 --> 00:38:24,907
I used to be

905
00:38:25,268 --> 00:38:26,268
a fidgety rider,

906
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:27,748
and I couldn't keep my mind calm,

907
00:38:28,028 --> 00:38:29,348
but now I'm delivering

908
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:31,068
in a calm and peaceful manner.

909
00:38:31,588 --> 00:38:32,508
What does it mean?

910
00:38:33,268 --> 00:38:34,627
When you have a change of mind,

911
00:38:35,227 --> 00:38:36,548
you will be happy,

912
00:38:37,068 --> 00:38:38,548
and you will be happy
in everything you do.

913
00:38:39,068 --> 00:38:39,828
Got it?

914
00:38:41,348 --> 00:38:42,068
I got it.

915
00:38:42,467 --> 00:38:43,108
I got it.

916
00:38:43,828 --> 00:38:45,588
That's a good point.

917
00:38:49,108 --> 00:38:49,867
Everyone

918
00:38:50,588 --> 00:38:52,187
should have a dream.

919
00:38:54,788 --> 00:38:55,308
Silly girl,

920
00:38:55,548 --> 00:38:56,988
listen here.

921
00:38:57,627 --> 00:38:58,788
Be careful
when you are carrying large items

922
00:38:58,828 --> 00:38:59,907
in the future.

923
00:38:59,907 --> 00:39:01,907
If you were like me now,

924
00:39:03,068 --> 00:39:04,828
you wouldn't even be able to
make deliveries for ten years.

925
00:39:15,828 --> 00:39:16,508
Uncle Tao.

926
00:39:18,508 --> 00:39:19,268
It's here, isn't it?

927
00:39:19,548 --> 00:39:20,108
No.

928
00:39:20,108 --> 00:39:20,828
It's not here.

929
00:39:20,828 --> 00:39:21,308
Lower.

930
00:39:21,308 --> 00:39:21,748
It's not here.

931
00:39:21,788 --> 00:39:23,028
Back.

932
00:39:23,028 --> 00:39:23,387
Here it is.

933
00:39:23,387 --> 00:39:24,508
Do you know where the back is?

934
00:39:24,548 --> 00:39:25,028
Here?

935
00:39:25,028 --> 00:39:25,667
No.

936
00:39:25,907 --> 00:39:26,867
How dare you say you studied
medicine with such a skill?

937
00:39:26,867 --> 00:39:28,028
Here it is.

938
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:29,548
What's wrong?

939
00:39:30,108 --> 00:39:30,627
It's here, isn't it?

940
00:39:30,627 --> 00:39:31,268
What's wrong?

941
00:39:31,308 --> 00:39:31,707
Well...

942
00:39:31,907 --> 00:39:32,947
No... Nothing.

943
00:39:32,988 --> 00:39:33,748
Don't make a fuss about it.

944
00:39:33,748 --> 00:39:34,147
Is it here?

945
00:39:34,147 --> 00:39:36,348
You seem to have made it worse.

946
00:39:36,748 --> 00:39:37,108
Tou Tou,

947
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:38,788
stop massaging him.

948
00:39:38,788 --> 00:39:39,627
It's expensive to go to hospital.

949
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:40,348
He has to see a doctor
even if it's expensive.

950
00:39:40,348 --> 00:39:41,707
No, he's got an old injury.

951
00:39:41,988 --> 00:39:43,387
So he needs to get
his old injury treated.

952
00:39:43,387 --> 00:39:44,508
I'm just worried that his back
will get worse with massage.

(Qibo Medical Centre)

954
00:39:56,867 --> 00:39:58,028
What are you doing here?

955
00:39:59,508 --> 00:40:00,108
Well,

956
00:40:00,748 --> 00:40:01,548
I have a friend

957
00:40:01,548 --> 00:40:03,068
who has a back pain.

958
00:40:03,988 --> 00:40:05,308
Can you check on him?

959
00:40:05,707 --> 00:40:06,988
Go and register.

960
00:40:07,748 --> 00:40:09,748
Can you check on him first?

961
00:40:11,588 --> 00:40:12,227
Because

962
00:40:13,348 --> 00:40:14,627
I don't have money.

963
00:40:14,788 --> 00:40:15,907
He doesn't have money either.

964
00:40:16,387 --> 00:40:17,147
But I'll pay it back

965
00:40:17,147 --> 00:40:19,187
for him later.

966
00:40:25,028 --> 00:40:26,907
Do you know how much it costs
for my medical treatment?

967
00:40:29,748 --> 00:40:30,867
Your one month's salary.

968
00:40:31,548 --> 00:40:32,387
So expensive?

969
00:40:35,068 --> 00:40:35,988
Didn't you say

970
00:40:35,988 --> 00:40:36,707
that a great healer

971
00:40:36,707 --> 00:40:37,988
must be at peace with his mind

972
00:40:37,988 --> 00:40:38,788
and free from desire?

973
00:40:38,788 --> 00:40:40,387
The first thing to do
is to show compassion.

974
00:40:41,308 --> 00:40:42,467
Since I've told you

975
00:40:43,147 --> 00:40:44,387
that we don't have money.

976
00:40:45,147 --> 00:40:47,387
Can't you give me a discount?

977
00:40:48,068 --> 00:40:49,867
If so, it means you can't walk the talk.

978
00:40:52,348 --> 00:40:54,387
It seems that the daily
morning reading really works.

979
00:40:54,387 --> 00:40:56,907
You even quoted the classic text
when you dissed me.

980
00:40:57,147 --> 00:40:58,427
I know he doesn't have money

981
00:40:59,387 --> 00:41:01,068
but I know you do.

982
00:41:01,427 --> 00:41:02,867
I don't have money.

983
00:41:02,867 --> 00:41:04,187
How could you not have money?

984
00:41:05,068 --> 00:41:05,667
You don't have money,

985
00:41:05,667 --> 00:41:07,108
so why do you take everything on you?

986
00:41:08,867 --> 00:41:09,947
This small amount of money

987
00:41:10,627 --> 00:41:12,508
means nothing to you.

988
00:41:19,068 --> 00:41:20,308
Master, I was wrong.

989
00:41:22,268 --> 00:41:24,348
I didn't behave properly,

990
00:41:24,788 --> 00:41:26,548
took everyone out to have fun

991
00:41:27,828 --> 00:41:29,988
and led my classmates

992
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:31,227
astray.

993
00:41:31,548 --> 00:41:33,068
You're still talking tough?

994
00:41:34,028 --> 00:41:35,907
You want to take responsibility
for this to the end, don't you?

995
00:41:36,707 --> 00:41:37,548
Alright.

996
00:41:38,068 --> 00:41:39,028
After you pay for the fee,

997
00:41:40,828 --> 00:41:42,028
bring your friend in

998
00:41:42,028 --> 00:41:43,068
and let me check on him.

999
00:41:44,308 --> 00:41:45,788
Can you treat him first

1000
00:41:46,627 --> 00:41:47,467
and I'll pay later?

1001
00:41:49,268 --> 00:41:50,867
Can I pay in instalments?

1002
00:41:51,227 --> 00:41:53,068
What kind of place do you think this is?

1003
00:41:55,147 --> 00:41:56,467
Aren't you eloquent?

1004
00:41:58,627 --> 00:41:59,227
Tell me.

(Qibo Medical Centre)

1006
00:42:09,348 --> 00:42:10,147
Amazing.

1007
00:42:11,268 --> 00:42:12,268
It's so amazing.

1008
00:42:14,028 --> 00:42:14,947
Try to move

1009
00:42:14,947 --> 00:42:16,588
and see if it still hurts.

1010
00:42:17,227 --> 00:42:17,627
Look,

1011
00:42:17,627 --> 00:42:18,227
I'm fine now.

1012
00:42:18,788 --> 00:42:19,308
Ms Dong.

1013
00:42:19,308 --> 00:42:19,867
Thank you.

1014
00:42:19,867 --> 00:42:20,828
Thank you.

1015
00:42:20,828 --> 00:42:21,627
You're welcome.

1016
00:42:21,627 --> 00:42:22,068
Ms Dong.

1017
00:42:22,068 --> 00:42:23,627
Can you teach me that technique?

1018
00:42:23,627 --> 00:42:24,748
Because a lot of my workmates

1019
00:42:24,748 --> 00:42:26,147
have back problems.

1020
00:42:26,147 --> 00:42:26,788
After you teach me,

1021
00:42:26,788 --> 00:42:28,028
I'll go back and
give them all a massage.

1022
00:42:28,028 --> 00:42:28,548
Yeah.

1023
00:42:28,548 --> 00:42:30,387
I can't teach you now.
