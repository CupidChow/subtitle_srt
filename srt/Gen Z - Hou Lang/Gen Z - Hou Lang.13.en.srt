1
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,280
It's really hard for those of us

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,000
who are trying to pass on the knowledge.

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,560
The Taoist preaches

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,160
that a master seeks out his disciple.

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,160
I agreed to give a lecture

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,480
not for you

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,800
but for myself.

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,719
I think

9
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,360
that if I give more lectures,

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,760
I will eventually get a student

11
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,280
who is willing to pass on all this

12
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,960
without changing the teacher's way.

13
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,120
If that's the case,

14
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,599
then I

15
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,960
will be able to answer

16
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,640
to my own master.

17
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,400
As long as there's a desire to do so,

18
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,200
it'll work.

19
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,680
Well said.

20
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,679
You can eat beef, right?

21
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,599
Yes.

22
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,317
I'm coming!

23
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,760
You're so slow.

24
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,597
What? Didn't we say to meet at 7pm?

25
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,317
-Look at the time now.
-I took the time to get changed.

26
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,437
-We're here!
-You're so slow.

27
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,520
-Tian Zhen!
-Coming.

28
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,840
-What's more?
-You haven't placed an order yet?

29
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,477
-We haven't.
-Let me do it.

30
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,559
We're here.

31
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,157
Tian Zhen,
you're so slow.

32
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,239
Very slow.

33
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,517
-I'm not the one who's slow.
-You're late.

34
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,238
-I need to...
-There is seafood.

35
00:01:29,321 --> 00:01:30,600
I had to wait for Meng Meng
to get changed.

36
00:01:30,684 --> 00:01:31,877
Seriously.
Fine then.

37
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,840
What would you like to eat?
Their crayfish are good.

38
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,479
Miss,

39
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,160
well,
we want crayfish.

40
00:01:38,244 --> 00:01:40,260
You have a lot of seafood.

41
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,157
Yes.
Our seafood is very fresh.

42
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,277
Give me more seafood then.

43
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,318
-Okay. Alright?
-Sure.

44
00:01:44,401 --> 00:01:45,557
Just prepare according to
the number of people we have.

45
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,120
What else do you want?

46
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,880
That's why we came early.

47
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,240
The point is that you
haven't ordered any food.

48
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,118
I was waiting for you.
Because you're late.

49
00:01:52,201 --> 00:01:53,397
The seafood here is not bad.

50
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,517
-So many, so fresh.
-Tou Tou.

51
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,599
I went to a lot of trouble
to find this spot.

52
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,480
What took you so long?

53
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:02,037
If it wasn't for Little Green,
I wouldn't have been able to make it.

54
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,997
What's the matter? The battery is dead?

55
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,317
-Hello.
-Hi, Xing Xing.

56
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,199
-Sit down.
-You can catch up here.

57
00:02:06,476 --> 00:02:07,836
Do you want sliced buns?

58
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,919
Yes.

59
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,477
Miss,
two skewers of sliced buns.

60
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,517
Make it three!
I want one.

61
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,597
-Do you want some?
-I want one too.

62
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,957
-Meng Meng wants it too.
-Four, five. Five skewers!

63
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,039
Five.

64
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,119
Why is someone in here?

65
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,679
Tou Tou.

66
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,960
I can't hold back any longer.

67
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,357
It will probably take a while.

68
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,199
Wait for a while.
No, this...

69
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,919
Zhao Li Quan,
can you hurry up?

70
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:46,600
I can't take it anymore.
I'm on my fifth trip here.

71
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,317
Tou Tou,
it's all your fault.

72
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,117
If it wasn't for you, would I have
gone to the toilet so many times?

73
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,199
No, what do you mean by...

74
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,677
How could you blame me for this?

75
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,677
Why didn't you thank me

76
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,706
when you were eating so happily?

77
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,720
Listen,
you asked for it.

78
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,997
I didn't force you to come!

79
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,157
Open the door now!

80
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,919
Alright.
I asked for it.

81
00:03:02,111 --> 00:03:05,360
I couldn't care less.
I need to poop in the field.

82
00:03:06,126 --> 00:03:07,285
Field?

83
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,440
Quick.

84
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,437
I can't hold back any longer.

85
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,519
I can't hold back any longer.

86
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,639
I know.

87
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,160
Tou Tou is calling me at this late hour.

88
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,760
Isn't she downstairs?

89
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,360
The kids aren't back yet.

90
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,600
-Hello.
-(Hello, Niece-in-law.)

91
00:03:49,684 --> 00:03:50,683
Come over now.

92
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,960
We're all dead.

93
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,360
We're all dead.

94
00:04:07,913 --> 00:04:09,306
No, I can't take it anymore.
I'm dying.

95
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,400
I can't take it. I'm dying.

96
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,999
I'm dying.

97
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,720
I'm dying.

98
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,440
How are you doing? Any better?

99
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,637
I can't take it.

100
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,719
You won't die.

101
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,418
Something is definitely wrong
with the seafood today.

102
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,557
I didn't have such severe diarrhoea

103
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,320
when I took gutter oil before.

104
00:04:29,406 --> 00:04:30,545
Something must be wrong
with it.

105
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,400
Did someone force you to eat it?

106
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,200
You've all got food poisoning.

107
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,200
You should all drink
your herbal medicine later.

108
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,399
Ms Song,

109
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,000
we have a bacterial infection.

110
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,239
Let's not resist it.

111
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,277
We'll be well tomorrow
if we get the antibiotics.

112
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,359
If we take the herbal medicine,

113
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,120
how many days
will it take to get better?

114
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,680
You can leave it out.

115
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,400
You can treat it with Western medicine.

116
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,200
I have something to say.

117
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,206
I have something to say.

118
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,440
You're already in
such a state, what else

119
00:05:04,514 --> 00:05:05,598
do you want to say?
You can say it tomorrow.

120
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:08,240
I can't wait till tomorrow.

121
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,440
I saw the skeleton patient

122
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,520
at the barbecue stall today.

123
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,359
That

124
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,920
skinny guy

125
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,117
who came in

126
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,920
with you guys today.

127
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,037
Since we have such severe diarrhoea,

128
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,240
he ordered a table full of seafood

129
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,277
and judging by his malnourished look,

130
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,476
I'm sure his condition
is even worse now.

131
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,920
Niece-in-law, Nephew, do you
think you should call and ask?

132
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,640
And Xing Xing.

133
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,840
Xing Xing
needs the medicine too.

134
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,079
What medicine is this? I
don't know. She needs it too.

135
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,519
Here you go.

136
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,080
What smell is this?

137
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,679
Drink it while it's hot.

138
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,106
No, it's too bitter.

139
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,278
It's too bitter.

140
00:06:15,361 --> 00:06:16,680
Good medicine tastes bitter.

141
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,317
You have got yourself sick

142
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,560
by indulging

143
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,600
in seafood outside.

144
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,240
I have to stay up to cook you medicine
but you're complaining it's bitter.

145
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,757
Don't drink it then.
Put up with the pain then.

146
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,839
Ms Song,

147
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,320
We know we were wrong.

148
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,680
Thank you. I'm sorry.

149
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,240
Alright, finish it quickly.

150
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,440
Get some rest after you've finished it.

151
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,600
I was so scared.

152
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,997
I thought we were doomed this time.

153
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,080
I never thought that
Mr Ren would not scold us.

154
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,240
Guys,
don't mess with your body.

155
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,400
If you can't take it,

156
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,480
just don't take it.

157
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,239
Shi Yan,

158
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,719
keep it.

159
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,560
Every day in class,
the teacher talks about

160
00:07:14,644 --> 00:07:16,316
not seeing the world
just from your own point of view

161
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,596
and not being stuck in a rut.

162
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,480
How come you can't figure it out
when you're sick?

163
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,240
Unlike TCM,

164
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,960
Western medicine's greatest
contribution to human longevity

165
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,200
is antibiotics.

166
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,120
The invention of this medicine

167
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,720
has increased human life
expectancy by an average of 20 years.

168
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,680
We have a bacterial infection.

169
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,680
We'll get well
after taking this.

170
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,680
Let's not fight science.

171
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,600
I'm not saying

172
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,157
Chinese medicine is bad,

173
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,560
it just takes time.

174
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,239
Do you want it or not?

175
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,119
Do you want it?

176
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,199
Give me one.

177
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,679
Give me one too.

178
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,559
Tian Zhen.

179
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,040
We may be able to take it as we're men.

180
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,960
Meng Meng is a weak girl.

181
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,277
If something does happen
to her in a few days,

182
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,680
what will you tell her parents?

183
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,799
Meng Meng,
are you still feeling unwell?

184
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,919
Take it.

185
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,240
I think you're quite weak.

186
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,360
Take both of these medicines,

187
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,240
there is always one that works.

188
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,239
Just take it.

189
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,400
Tou Tou, this is for you.

190
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,800
No, I will drink Chinese medicine.

191
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,720
Why are you acting like
you're really in it?

192
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,280
Do you really think
you're the successor?

193
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,198
Alright.
Even if you are the successor,

194
00:08:32,281 --> 00:08:34,000
don't mess with your life.

195
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,280
No, what's wrong with you guys?

196
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,917
My nephew took our pulse
and prescribed the medicine,

197
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,680
and my niece-in-law
brewed the medicine herself.

198
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,880
Aren't you ashamed
of wasting their efforts?

199
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,279
Are you not ashamed?

200
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,559
But I am.

201
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,040
No one has ever been
this nice to me in my whole life.

202
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,919
Listen,

203
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,237
I'll drink this medicine

204
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,120
even if it doesn't work.

205
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,157
I admire you.

206
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,597
There is really someone who wants
to risk her life to repay a favour.

207
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,440
Alright, I won't persuade you anymore.

208
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,957
I can help you with something else.

209
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,957
If you're dead...

210
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,920
Won't it be too late to
take antibiotics then?

211
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,239
That's not what I meant.

212
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,397
I have a friend at the crematorium,

213
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,479
I can help you jump the queue

214
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,359
-and get burnt first.
-I'll burn...

215
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,597
I'll burn you first.

216
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,680
Jump the queue for what?

217
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,599
Look here, everyone.

218
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,840
For my nephew and niece-in-law,

219
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,799
I'll finish it.

220
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,440
What a pleasure!

221
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,840
Tou,
you're amazing.

222
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,680
I feel sick to my stomach
at the smell of oil now.

223
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,918
The wild species

224
00:10:15,001 --> 00:10:16,720
is really different from us.

225
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,837
Attacked by Schrodinger's diarrhoea,

226
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,560
Tou is still the toughest.

227
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,840
No, what is Schrodinger's diarrhoea?

228
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,120
Something you can't verify.

229
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,677
You don't know whether it's Chinese

230
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,518
or Western medicine

231
00:10:27,601 --> 00:10:28,680
that works faster.

232
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,040
The samples differ.

233
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,880
You reap what you sow.

234
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,840
If you were to drink the medicine with
me, you would have been well by now.

235
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,197
Tou,

236
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,038
let me put it to you seriously.

237
00:10:39,121 --> 00:10:40,637
You must not spread the word

238
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,280
that you have cured your
diarrhoea by taking Chinese medicine

239
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,600
to avoid killing people.

240
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,077
Many people don't understand,

241
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,680
so they take small probabilities

242
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,517
as facts.

243
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,837
Tou has such a strong body.

244
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,919
She heals herself

245
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,120
without Chinese medicine.

246
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,919
You don't even know

247
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,160
that Tou has a steel mill
in her belly, right?

248
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,717
She can turn wire

249
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,160
into steel flakes in her belly.

250
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,437
What did your father

251
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,519
call us here for today?

252
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,478
I guess it's about Ms Dong's

253
00:11:06,561 --> 00:11:07,837
technique class.

254
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,919
Technique class?

255
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,799
Let's go.

256
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,040
Are you all right?

257
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,919
Who else still has diarrhoea?

258
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,159
Mr Ren,
we're all much better

259
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,279
You're all much better?

260
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,559
Alright.

261
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,040
So let's get this straight.

262
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,119
Whose idea was it?

263
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,799
Tian Zhen.

264
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,279
Dad,

265
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,917
everyone just got diarrhoea.

266
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,040
It wasn't that bad.

267
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,960
It wasn't that bad?

268
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,800
You, as a doctor,

269
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,800
violate discipline

270
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,360
with your patients.

271
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,800
Can you be responsible

272
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,240
if anything happens to her?

273
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,318
I am liable

274
00:12:30,401 --> 00:12:31,560
if any of you

275
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,400
have a problem.

276
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,197
I have worked so hard

277
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,560
to pass on my knowledge,

278
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,317
how could I raise such

279
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,000
ungrateful students?

280
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,960
God is watching us.

281
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,440
You guys

282
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,440
are the hope of Chinese medicine.

283
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,520
How are you worthy of

284
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,960
the word hope?

285
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,557
If all students

286
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,917
were as free

287
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,240
as you are,

288
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,997
Chinese civilization

289
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,400
would have been extinguished

290
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,720
like other ancient civilizations.

291
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,160
How many times have I told you

292
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,557
what your routine should be,

293
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,478
what you should do

294
00:13:21,561 --> 00:13:22,800
and what you shouldn't do?

295
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,917
Are you less intelligent

296
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,720
than primary school students?

297
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,797
Why Chinese culture

298
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,200
is about the unity of
knowledge and action?

299
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,840
You know it but you don't do it.

300
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,160
You have learned it

301
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,439
and then ignored it.

302
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,637
All the students

303
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,000
in the apprentice class

304
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,440
appear to be sick now.

305
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,320
How can you

306
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,880
convince others

307
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,200
that Chinese medicine is the
knowledge of health and wellness?

308
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,477
Report. I can.

309
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,559
I didn't join them last night.

310
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,999
I'm not talking about you.

311
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,000
I have always

312
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,880
believed that

313
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,037
the passing on of Chinese medicine

314
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,000
is a common goal for us all.

315
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,600
But today, it seems

316
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,000
to be just my wishful thinking.

317
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,757
If you really don't want to do it,

318
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,117
if you really don't want to learn it,

319
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,477
then I will stop running

320
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,640
this apprentice class.

321
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,240
You have freed me.

322
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,477
I don't have to

323
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,517
worry about the location
of the classroom

324
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,760
for the apprentice class anymore.

325
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,120
Let's free ourselves from each other.

326
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,037
Mr Ren,

327
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,600
it's not fair to me.

328
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,838
If they don't fit,

329
00:14:34,921 --> 00:14:36,357
they can leave.

330
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,677
But I have followed

331
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,917
your instructions exactly
from the beginning.

332
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,186
I think I'm a
very qualified and good student.

333
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,317
If the class is discontinued,

334
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,240
you should allow me
to continue my studies with you.

335
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,957
On the first day of class,

336
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,560
I told you

337
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,037
that all the students in the class

338
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,040
were mirrors and rulers

339
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,439
to each other.

340
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,760
You saw them doing something wrong.

341
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,320
If I judge you
from their point of view,

342
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,519
you are in the wrong too.

343
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,399
I advised them,

344
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,320
but none of them listened to me.

345
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,957
Now that something has gone wrong,
is it fair to me who is the only person

346
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,440
who hasn't made a mistake

347
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,760
to share the blame with them?

348
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,120
Do you think you are right?

349
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,597
So how come they don't listen

350
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,760
to anything you say to them?

351
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,880
You did a PhD, right?

352
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,720
You're a barrister.

353
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,600
Then why don't all your classmates

354
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,600
have any faith in you?

355
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,600
If so, how do you have the
ability to pass on knowledge?

356
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,360
I am not here to learn
about passing on knowledge,

357
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,080
I am here to learn how to save lives.

358
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,320
Sweep the snow from your own doorstep,

359
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,880
don't worry about the frost
on your neighbour's roof.

360
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,359
Master.

361
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,120
Master.

362
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,479
Well...

363
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,160
Yesterday,

364
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,477
I was...

365
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,440
I was the one who
asked everyone to join me.

366
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,239
Because

367
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,000
I craved skewers.

368
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:01,958
So I asked them

369
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:03,120
to join me.

370
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,960
And I was the one who ordered the food.

371
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,680
So I think
maybe the food I ordered

372
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,277
was just not clean or something.

373
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,640
You want to take
responsibility for this?

374
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,360
Are you up to it?

375
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,637
Mr Ren,

376
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,960
it was me who gathered everyone there.

377
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,440
It's not Tou's fault alone.

378
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,599
I'm the Class Leader.

379
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,320
I didn't take good care of
my fellow classmates.

380
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,999
It's my responsibility.

381
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,079
Mr Ren,

382
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,000
we all went of our own free will.

383
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,239
I am responsible for that too.

384
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,037
I am willing to be punished together.

385
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,117
Yes.

386
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,640
We all went of our own free will.

387
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,719
A law is violated by a lot of people
and is thus left unenforced instead.

388
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,119
If you want to expel anyone,

389
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,319
you'd better expel all of us.

390
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,119
Master!

391
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,240
It's really me.

392
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,600
It's really my responsibility alone.

393
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,119
Master,

394
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,600
don't disband the apprentice class.

395
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,677
They can really pass it on

396
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,080
after studying Chinese medicine.

397
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,760
It's the cravings that got me.

398
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,277
I know I've let you down again

399
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,520
by not being good enough.

400
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,240
Why don't you punish me?

401
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,160
Okay, Master?

402
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,240
You want to be a heroin?

403
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,160
You want to take the blame
for this, right?

404
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,999
Alright.

405
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,477
I guess my little pond

406
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,600
can't keep a big shark like you anymore.

407
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,520
From now on,

408
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,360
you are no longer a student
of the apprentice class.

409
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,000
You can leave now.

410
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,719
I can't teach you.

411
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,719
And I don't know how to teach you!

412
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,759
Mum.

413
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,197
Stop following me.

414
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,720
You're still at work.

415
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,520
Where are you going?

416
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,038
I'm going to look for a job.

417
00:18:11,121 --> 00:18:12,440
I can get one at any time.

418
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,760
So where are you going to live?

419
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,760
You can't go back to
Tian Zhen's home anymore.

420
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,397
How about this?

421
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,357
You can move back in with Xing Xing.

422
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,360
I'll move my stuff out,
I can't take up your space.

423
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,560
Zhao Li Quan, are you a fool?

424
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,277
You've finally got a place
to settle down.

425
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,880
Just live there in peace.

426
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,440
I have a place to live.

427
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,639
You're not fooling me?

428
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,358
Why should I fool you?

429
00:18:36,441 --> 00:18:37,720
I really have a place to live

430
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,960
and it's a single room.

431
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,959
Listen here.

432
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,360
You are the hope of your whole village

433
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,717
and the talent of the community.

434
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,637
You will be needed

435
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,719
in many ways in the future.

436
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,120
You are going to be a great doctor.

437
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,638
Don't stay in

438
00:18:52,721 --> 00:18:54,000
those messy places.

439
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,517
Just live in peace
with Xing Xing.

440
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,599
Don't worry about anything else.

441
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,200
I was
never one of you.

442
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,919
So now I'm off

443
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,560
to wander the world with Little Green.

444
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,359
Bye.

445
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,959
Go back.

446
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,920
I think, in life,

447
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,960
we deserve to be forgiven

448
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,560
as long as we don't harm
someone on purpose.

449
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,480
Just like me.

450
00:19:37,561 --> 00:19:40,240
Even if I did break someone's bones,
I stood up for what was right.

451
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,480
So you can't include that
in my dark history.

452
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,360
We need to look at
the bright side of life.

453
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,879
Stop blaming yourself.

454
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,160
If I may suggest,

455
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,479
learn medicine from me.

456
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,839
Learn TCM.

457
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,599
I really think

458
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,440
you have a talent for studying TCM.

459
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,599
In TCM,

460
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,240
if you can accurately
identify the illness,

461
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,839
confront it,

462
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,557
defeat it,

463
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,080
and cure the patient's condition,

464
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,080
the sense of accomplishment

465
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,240
is much stronger than catching a doll.

466
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,440
You're really mad?

467
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,959
Here you go.

468
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,400
What's with me?

469
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,560
Why do I have such a student?

470
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,000
It's your disciple.

471
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,597
This is the disciple

472
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,600
God sent you.

473
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,720
Being grateful to God, respecting
teachers and remembering elders.

474
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,720
Your master, who is also my father,

475
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,360
gave you such a tough task

476
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,120
and you accepted it,

477
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,517
didn't you?

478
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,840
You can't blame anyone else, can you?

479
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,640
Don't let yourself

480
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,440
get into trouble

481
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,040
when you haven't nurtured a disciple.

482
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,839
It's good that she's left.

483
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,439
It's good that she's left.

484
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,640
I've tried my best.

485
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,000
It's not that I don't want
to nurture her,

486
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,080
she won't let me.

487
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,120
She's hopeless.

488
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,560
Enough, I know you well.

489
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,360
Don't take advantage of the issue.

490
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,719
Listen,

491
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,160
today's incident

492
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,960
has really made me

493
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,160
change my view of Tou Tou.

494
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,839
This kid

495
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,119
can be nurtured.

496
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,479
I mean it.

497
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,160
Look, she stepped forward

498
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,160
to admit her mistake today.

499
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,157
I observed the other kids

500
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,440
closely.

501
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,840
In fact, they all looked ashamed.

502
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,840
So she may not be

503
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,680
the one who started it.

504
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,278
Princess Taiping made a mistake,
right?

505
00:22:34,361 --> 00:22:35,560
But she admitted it.

506
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,840
Didn't Wu Zetian also lament

507
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,240
that it was a pity she wasn't a man?

508
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,720
Are you comparing her to a princess?

509
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,600
She's a stubborn monkey.

510
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,797
Since she's a stubborn monkey,

511
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,480
why are you so angry?

512
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,080
You've taken it to heart.

513
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,479
Look,

514
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,517
she had such severe diarrhoea,

515
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,599
she still thought of

516
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,120
those irrelevant people

517
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,720
around her.

518
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,319
What does it mean?

519
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,240
It means she is observant and caring.

520
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,560
Of all the students who were there,

521
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,758
how come none of them
noticed that?

522
00:23:25,841 --> 00:23:27,000
What do you mean by this gesture?

523
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,397
You've complimented her twice

524
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,120
for being observant and caring.

525
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,920
If you want to keep her,

526
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,158
call her

527
00:23:42,241 --> 00:23:43,397
and get her back.

528
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,479
No.

529
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,360
If she doesn't come back,

530
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,237
this is the end of

531
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,319
our apprenticeship.

532
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,720
Is there a rebellion going on?

533
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,357
There are so many people in the world

534
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,560
who want to be my disciple.

535
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,720
Do I have to beg her?

536
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,599
Is she my grandma?

537
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,359
Yes.

538
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,840
If she doesn't come back, let her be.

539
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,359
Since she's left,

540
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,360
let's stop running this class.

541
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,240
So you can take some money home.

542
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,157
I can't

543
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,400
take money home.

544
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,880
If I could have done that,

545
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,760
you wouldn't have married me.

546
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,440
We have a very clear division of duties.

547
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,960
You are at home dealing
with mundane tasks

548
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,560
while I am out doing good deeds.

549
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,277
Can you tell me what kind of

550
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,760
good deeds you have done?

551
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,080
I teach

552
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,640
and nurture my students.

553
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,080
Treating patients is also a good deed

554
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,437
but there are so many
people in the world.

555
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,477
Even if I were capable,

556
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,360
I wouldn't be able to care so much.

557
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,637
I've thought about it.

558
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,157
Once
I've nurtured a great doctor,

559
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,637
I'll have an extra hand.

560
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,237
If I've nurtured 3,000 great doctors,

561
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,319
well...

562
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,840
I haven't seen you

563
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,077
nurture much renowned students

564
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,960
in all these years.

565
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,720
It takes ten years to plant a tree,

566
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,720
but a hundred years to nurture a person.

567
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,880
I haven't lived long enough.

568
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,079
Enough.

569
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,840
My father was absolutely right.

570
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,198
Do you know what God

571
00:25:25,281 --> 00:25:26,960
is asking you to fix?

572
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,080
Pride.

573
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,160
The reason you can't even
let go of your pride today

574
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,797
is because

575
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,960
we have all lost face for you.

576
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,960
When you took all the family's savings

577
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:42,997
to support

578
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,720
the poor community,

579
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,557
as a married daughter,

580
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,478
I took my son

581
00:25:47,561 --> 00:25:49,120
back to my parents' house for food,

582
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,840
didn't I embarrass myself?

583
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,199
You've said it twice.

584
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,037
Alright.

585
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,280
Okay, I will stop talking about this.

586
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,880
Let's talk about

587
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,960
your resignation.

588
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,757
You're ashamed to
return to the university,

589
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,240
so you asked me to
go and pack your stuff for you.

590
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,000
Did I feel ashamed?

591
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,560
No.

592
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,239
Look,

593
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,560
You let me

594
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,600
do everything you find hard to deal with

595
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,080
for you.

596
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,559
What does it mean?

597
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,757
It means that

598
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,157
God really wants to

599
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,360
smack your pride

600
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,800
on the ground
and rub it off,

601
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,719
just like that.

602
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,200
If you can do it,

603
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,080
you'll break through.

604
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,757
If you

605
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,397
don't want to beg
your disciple to come back,

606
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,479
fine.

607
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,719
You may

608
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,477
ask Liu

609
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,840
to find another classroom for you.

610
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,397
Isn't he just

611
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,637
trying to do something

612
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,880
in your name?

613
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,240
Nowadays, there are

614
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,917
so many people

615
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,838
who do things

616
00:27:06,921 --> 00:27:08,040
in the name of others.

617
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,479
What is this?

618
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,197
Everyone has their own tricks

619
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,520
and ways of dealing with things.

620
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,477
If you don't want to do it,

621
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,398
you can find him

622
00:27:15,481 --> 00:27:16,680
someone who does.

623
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,120
You've got a point here.

624
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,638
He's not really

625
00:27:25,721 --> 00:27:26,917
using my name,

626
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,880
but TCM.

627
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,119
That makes sense.

628
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,720
Looks like God is helping me.

629
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,037
Is God helping you

630
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,600
or is your wife helping you?

631
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,877
God's way of helping me

632
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,480
was to let me marry you.

633
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,880
You have said it for the fifth time.

634
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,600
(End of heat)

635
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,920
(means the heat is leaving.)

636
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:08,400
(It reminds people that
the summer heat is fading)

637
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,040
(and the weather is gradually
transitioning to cooler.)

638
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,640
(End of Heat)

639
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,720
Professor Ren,

640
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,280
you're really treating me
to a feast today.

641
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,440
I didn't expect this.

642
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,080
Are you here alone?

643
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,920
Where are those investors?

644
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,080
I'm not sure what you're up to

645
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,840
after being fooled by you so many times.

646
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,440
I am here today
to find out your intentions.

647
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,637
Mr Liu, I've actually

648
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,880
been wondering

649
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,800
if you really

650
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,760
want to invest in TCM?

651
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,637
I don't know anything about it.

652
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,317
So I would like to use your reputation.

653
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,400
But you disagreed.

654
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,440
You want to use my reputation.

655
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,677
I've got two legs.

656
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,917
What if I run away

657
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,200
and your efforts are wasted?

658
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,360
Where are you running to?

659
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,077
Who doesn't know you

660
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,677
as a highly respected TCM practitioner?

661
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,759
Cut the crap.

662
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,106
Besides,
I also have a passion

663
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:30,160
for the promotion
of Chinese medicine

664
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,806
and culture.

665
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,240
I'm not kidding.

666
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,839
Really?

667
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,719
Alright.

668
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,839
I'm relieved now.

669
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,117
To be honest,

670
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,757
I invited you here today

671
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,557
to introduce you

672
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,040
to a highly qualified person

673
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,360
in the industry of TCM.

674
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,119
Who is it?

675
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,986
You will know it
when he is here.

676
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,120
Sorry for being late,

677
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,440
I was stuck in traffic.

678
00:30:04,746 --> 00:30:06,038
Let me introduce.

679
00:30:06,121 --> 00:30:07,925
This is the principal of
University of TCM,

680
00:30:08,009 --> 00:30:10,277
-Wu Shan Dao.
-Mr Wu.

681
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,785
I'm just an acting principal.
An acting principal.

682
00:30:11,869 --> 00:30:16,240
This is Mr Liu, the owner
of the TCM industrial park.

683
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,757
Mr Liu.

684
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,839
I've heard a lot about you.

685
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,277
You two can talk alone

686
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,533
over a meal later.

687
00:30:22,617 --> 00:30:23,637
Okay.

688
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,637
-I am pleased to meet you.
-I hope we can work well together.

689
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,120
Thank you.

690
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,637
Have a seat.
Come on.

691
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,717
Have a seat.
Have a seat.

692
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,156
-Your delivery is here.
-Alright.

693
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,000
Well,
I've flown you

694
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,773
matsutake

695
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,119
from Yunnan.

696
00:30:37,203 --> 00:30:38,158
Come in.

697
00:30:38,241 --> 00:30:39,760
Can you tell me the collection...

698
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,639
Collection...

699
00:30:47,315 --> 00:30:48,419
Look.

700
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,959
Collection code.
765558.

701
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,720
There is an extra number, right?

702
00:30:53,869 --> 00:30:54,860
765558.

703
00:30:54,944 --> 00:30:56,333
Are my eyes bad
or yours?

704
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,720
Three fives and an eight.

705
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,200
Okay, I'll leave it here for you.

706
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,920
Tou Tou is working a part-time job.

707
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,439
Do you know it, Senior?

708
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,759
Waiter!

709
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,119
Come in.

710
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,639
Well,

711
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,599
you

712
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,720
haven't been in touch
with Tou Tou lately?

713
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,359
No.

714
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,360
How can you be so cold-hearted?

715
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,573
You don't even know
what she's doing?

716
00:31:45,526 --> 00:31:46,643
That's your grandmaster,

717
00:31:46,727 --> 00:31:47,727
your classmate.

718
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,200
She's your senior aunt too,

719
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,080
and also your student.

720
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,078
If you're not cold-hearted,

721
00:31:54,161 --> 00:31:55,440
why ask me?

722
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,559
Right,

723
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,320
you're the one who drove her away.

724
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,880
Since you drove her away,

725
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,397
she is no longer my classmate

726
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,760
or your student.

727
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,360
Isn't it a bit unnecessary for us

728
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,277
to be concerned about her now?

729
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,840
You are going to be a doctor one day.

730
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,877
After all these years of
being nurtured by the family,

731
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,877
you fail at being observant

732
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,157
and caring,

733
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,560
far worse than Tou Tou.

734
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,557
Dad,

735
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,480
if you have something to say,
can you just be straight with me?

736
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,119
Go ahead with your calligraphy.

737
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,320
(Grandson, I have a lot of deliveries
to make today and I will be late.)

738
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,280
(By the way, remember to
bring my skateboard with you).

739
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,879
Roger.

740
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,160
Do you need supper?

741
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,920
You're such a filial grandson.

742
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,080
(You're such a filial grandson.)

743
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,759
Uncle Tao,

744
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,520
why are you still lying in my place?

745
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,197
-Let me stay in your room for a while.
-I've told you many times.

746
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,036
Help me with massage.

747
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,440
You need to go to the doctor
to check your back.

748
00:33:26,513 --> 00:33:27,999
You can't keep lying on your stomach.

749
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,158
It's okay.

750
00:33:29,241 --> 00:33:31,080
I have to take time off work to go
to hospital and it's a waste of time.

751
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,240
You have great massage skills.

752
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,880
Don't you have social insurance?

753
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,797
You wish!

754
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,917
Our company filed our social
insurance in other regions.

755
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,797
(Uncle Tao)

756
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,640
So we can't use it for
medical treatment in Jiangzhou.

757
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,120
But you can't put it off.

758
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,040
I told you I studied medicine.

759
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,560
From my experience,

760
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:48,997
you're bound to get sick

761
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,560
if you keep putting it off.

762
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,757
Cut the crap.

763
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,839
Stop bragging.

764
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,437
Here are your brush, ink and paper.

765
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,519
Remember to bring them along.

766
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,879
Why should I?

767
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,440
Do you think I'll still be practising
calligraphy when I'm gone?

768
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,080
You can't leave anything
you've used with me either.

769
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,679
If you want to throw them away,
do it yourself.

770
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,880
What are you writing?

771
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,480
Look at your calligraphic writing.

772
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,717
Those who know
will know that you wrote it,

773
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,840
those who don't
will think it's a turtle's footprint.

774
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,600
When others write calligraphy,

775
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,799
they...

776
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,080
What are you doing?

777
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,840
I'm talking to you.

778
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,877
What are you doing?

779
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,877
Uncle Tao, if you have nothing to
do here, you should go back to bed.

780
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,400
I'm doing homework.

781
00:35:57,539 --> 00:35:58,880
This is your homework?

782
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,480
This is the homework my master gave me.

783
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,637
My master told me
to practise like this

784
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,920
for ten years.

785
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,918
After ten years,
I will be thirty-two years old

786
00:36:06,001 --> 00:36:08,080
and when I write my prescriptions,

787
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,800
my patients will have confidence in me

788
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,078
when I start writing.
Get it?

789
00:36:12,161 --> 00:36:13,197
Stop fooling me.

790
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,558
I don't believe you when you say
you'll be a delivery rider for ten years,

791
00:36:15,641 --> 00:36:18,160
let alone ten years from now
when you'll be treating patients.

792
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,480
Silly girl,
listen here.

793
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,076
Anyone who promises you

794
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,040
something ten years from now

795
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,920
is a liar.

796
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,159
Remember this.

797
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,240
You're pretty serious.

798
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,480
I think

799
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,280
you are an over-ambitious

800
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,080
small potato.

801
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,440
Just accept your fate.

802
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,397
Even if you've been practising
calligraphy for ten years,

803
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,800
you're still a delivery rider.

804
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,280
What's wrong with still being
a delivery rider in ten years?

805
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,280
That will make a difference.

806
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,840
I used to be

807
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,200
a fidgety rider,

808
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,680
and I couldn't keep my mind calm,

809
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,280
but now I'm delivering

810
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,000
in a calm and peaceful manner.

811
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,519
What does it mean?

812
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,560
When you have a change of mind,

813
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,480
you will be happy,

814
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,480
and you will be happy
in everything you do.

815
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,999
Got it?

816
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,279
I got it.

817
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,399
I got it.

818
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,520
That's a good point.

819
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,039
Everyone

820
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,120
should have a dream.

821
00:37:19,626 --> 00:37:21,853
Silly girl,
listen here.

822
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,677
Be careful
when you are carrying large items

823
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,757
in the future.

824
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,840
If you were like me now,

825
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,760
you wouldn't even be able to
make deliveries for ten years.

826
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,759
Uncle Tao.

827
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,396
It's here, isn't it?

828
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,677
No.
It's not here.

829
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,378
-Lower.
-It's not here.

830
00:37:47,461 --> 00:37:49,397
Back. Here it is.
Do you know where the back is?

831
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,757
-Here?
-No.

832
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,960
-How dare you say you studied medicine?
-Here it is.

833
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,799
What's wrong?

834
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,156
-It's here, isn't it?
-What's wrong?

835
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,837
-Well...
-No... Nothing.

836
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,998
Don't make a fuss about it.
Is it here?

837
00:37:59,081 --> 00:38:01,280
You seem to have made it worse.

838
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,637
Tou Tou,
stop massaging him.

839
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,517
It's expensive to go to hospital.

840
00:38:04,606 --> 00:38:06,686
-He has to see a doctor still.
-No, he's got an old injury.

841
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,237
So he needs to get
his old injury treated.

842
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,440
I'm just worried that his back
will get worse with massage.

(Qibo Medical Centre)

844
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,960
What are you doing here?

845
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,439
Well,

846
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,000
I have a friend
who has a back pain.

847
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,240
Can you check on him?

848
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,920
Go and register.

849
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,680
Can you check on him first?

850
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,519
Because

851
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,560
I don't have money.

852
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,840
He doesn't have money either.

853
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:44,120
But I'll pay it back
for him later.

854
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,840
Do you know how much it costs
for my medical treatment?

855
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,800
Your one month's salary.

856
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,479
So expensive?

857
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,558
Didn't you say
that a great healer

858
00:39:01,641 --> 00:39:02,837
must be at peace with his mind

859
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,320
and free from desire? The first
thing to do is to show compassion.

860
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,400
Since I've told you

861
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,320
that we don't have money.

862
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,320
Can't you give me a discount?

863
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,800
If so, it means you can't walk the talk.

864
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,237
It seems that the daily
morning reading really works.

865
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,840
You even quoted the classic text
when you dissed me.

866
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,360
I know he doesn't have money

867
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,000
but I know you do.

868
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,717
I don't have money.

869
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,120
How could you not have money?

870
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:32,040
You don't have money,
so why do you take everything on you?

871
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,880
This small amount of money

872
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,440
means nothing to you.

873
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,240
Master, I was wrong.

874
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,280
I didn't behave properly,

875
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,480
took everyone out to have fun

876
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,837
and led my classmates

877
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,160
astray.

878
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,000
You're still talking tough?

879
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,840
You want to take responsibility
for this to the end, don't you?

880
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:02,639
Alright.

881
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:03,999
After you pay for the fee,

882
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,877
bring your friend in

883
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,000
and let me check on him.

884
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,720
Can you treat him first

885
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,559
and I'll pay later?

886
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,720
Can I pay in installments?

887
00:40:16,006 --> 00:40:17,846
What kind of place do you think this is?

00:40:20,019 --> 00:40:21,339

and see if it still hurts.

You're welcome.

Can you teach me that technique?

898

Because a lot of my workmates
have back problems.

and give them all a massage.
