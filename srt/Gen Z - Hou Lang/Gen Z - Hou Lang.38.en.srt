00:01:30,748 --> 00:01:34,920
(Gen Z)

2
00:01:35,652 --> 00:01:37,800
(Episode 37)

3
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,753
Try it and tell me how you feel.

4
00:01:54,196 --> 00:01:57,082
I'm not well-versed in this field.
I cannot tell if it's good or bad.

5
00:01:58,856 --> 00:02:01,362
It doesn't matter if you can't tell
whether the tea is good or bad.

6
00:02:05,643 --> 00:02:07,923
However, you need to be able to
differentiate between right and wrong.

7
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,510
Do you have something to tell me?

8
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:24,630
No.

9
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,410
Is there something you want to tell me?

10
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,720
What do you want to hear, Mr Ren?

11
00:02:39,575 --> 00:02:40,375
What are

12
00:02:42,097 --> 00:02:44,497
people made up of?

13
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,680
Good and bad.

14
00:02:53,777 --> 00:02:54,577
That's right.

15
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,680
Yin and Yang.

16
00:03:00,457 --> 00:03:01,817
In fact, throughout our lives,

17
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,959
we may have many evil thoughts.

18
00:03:04,156 --> 00:03:06,116
Even in marriage,

19
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,103
there may be countless times
when we want to kill the other person.

20
00:03:12,737 --> 00:03:15,296
But when you turn around to grab a gun,
you suddenly notice

21
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,881
a rose

22
00:03:19,377 --> 00:03:20,576
on the windowsill.

23
00:03:21,641 --> 00:03:22,842
You decide to pick it

24
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:25,494
and give it to the other person.

25
00:03:26,796 --> 00:03:28,476
Mr Ren, forgive my ignorance.

26
00:03:29,988 --> 00:03:31,028
I don't understand.

27
00:03:36,097 --> 00:03:37,896
If a person has a conscience,

28
00:03:38,417 --> 00:03:40,256
I believe they won't go too far astray.

29
00:03:41,017 --> 00:03:42,417
If you have something you want

30
00:03:42,497 --> 00:03:43,297
to say to me today,

31
00:03:44,337 --> 00:03:45,377
say it

32
00:03:46,056 --> 00:03:46,856
now.

33
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,852
I'll bear the responsibility for you.

34
00:03:50,737 --> 00:03:52,950
If you think you haven't deviated
from the right path,

35
00:03:57,177 --> 00:03:58,177
you can leave.

36
00:04:07,977 --> 00:04:09,696
-Mr Ren...
-Think before you speak.

37
00:04:09,817 --> 00:04:11,017
Every word you say

38
00:04:11,097 --> 00:04:12,177
will have consequences.

39
00:04:13,337 --> 00:04:14,617
Think it through.

40
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,089
I have nothing to say.

41
00:04:25,696 --> 00:04:27,337
Your teacher, Wu Shan Dao,

42
00:04:27,897 --> 00:04:29,377
copied a poem for me

43
00:04:30,097 --> 00:04:32,017
when I was established the class.

44
00:04:33,537 --> 00:04:34,436
It's right over there.

45
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,839
Open it

46
00:04:36,662 --> 00:04:37,462
and read it out.

47
00:05:07,337 --> 00:05:08,817
Good and evil are manifested

48
00:05:10,416 --> 00:05:11,537
in our actions.

49
00:05:13,097 --> 00:05:16,897
Through these actions, we distinguish
between the petty and the noble.

50
00:05:19,737 --> 00:05:22,576
A noble person seeks to amend their
misguided plans without causing harm,

51
00:05:24,737 --> 00:05:27,416
while one who remains lost and
unrepentant becomes a petty person.

52
00:05:31,737 --> 00:05:34,129
A good medicine proves
its efficacy in treating illnesses,

53
00:05:36,737 --> 00:05:39,656
just as an unblemished jade
is cherished for its purity.

54
00:05:41,737 --> 00:05:44,696
To become an exemplary individual,
one must strive for refinement.

55
00:05:46,696 --> 00:05:48,929
How can one not seek redemption
after making mistakes?

56
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,080
It's a good poem.

57
00:05:56,897 --> 00:05:57,697
A good one.

58
00:06:00,737 --> 00:06:03,937
"Admonitions for My Son" by
Shao Yong of the Northern Song Dynasty.

59
00:06:09,742 --> 00:06:10,542
Mr Ren,

60
00:06:14,617 --> 00:06:15,816
I made mistakes.

61
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,121
Goodbye.

62
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:35,216
Thank you, doctor.

63
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:37,056
-Thank you, doctor.
-Go and get some rest.

64
00:06:37,136 --> 00:06:37,776
-Okay.
-Go on.

65
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:39,216
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

66
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,880
Hello, Mr He.

67
00:07:19,576 --> 00:07:21,976
(Miracle Doctor, I need help.)

68
00:07:22,296 --> 00:07:23,457
What's wrong? Take it easy.

69
00:07:23,657 --> 00:07:24,568
Tell me what happened.

70
00:07:24,737 --> 00:07:26,696
These past few days
have been really strange.

71
00:07:27,136 --> 00:07:29,177
Many of my patients here
have caught a cold.

72
00:07:30,096 --> 00:07:33,056
I've been giving them the same
medication I usually prescribe for flu.

73
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,479
But it doesn't seem to be effective.
Especially Uncle Niu,

74
00:07:36,617 --> 00:07:38,377
he's been coughing for several days
and doesn't seem to be getting better.

75
00:07:38,457 --> 00:07:41,256
Just now, he even had trouble breathing.
I'm really worried.

76
00:07:41,737 --> 00:07:44,296
Calm down.
What are Uncle Niu's symptoms?

77
00:07:44,376 --> 00:07:46,128
What medications did
you prescribe for him?

78
00:07:47,816 --> 00:07:49,336
It's really weird.

79
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:52,216
Some people have a cold, some
are coughing, some have a fever,

80
00:07:52,296 --> 00:07:54,576
and some say they can't taste anything
when they eat.

81
00:07:54,856 --> 00:07:55,737
(I prescribed)

82
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,376
(powder of honeysuckle and forsythia,)

83
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,300
ginseng toxin-vanquishing powder
and various herbal soups here,

84
00:07:59,381 --> 00:08:00,621
but none of them seem to work.

85
00:08:02,177 --> 00:08:03,416
(What should I do?)

86
00:08:03,856 --> 00:08:04,776
Can you come over?

87
00:08:04,856 --> 00:08:05,737
I'm really desperate.

88
00:08:07,136 --> 00:08:07,937
Mr He.

89
00:08:08,296 --> 00:08:09,495
Tao Zi, why are you here?

90
00:08:09,576 --> 00:08:10,817
Grandma caught a cold
in the provincial capital.

91
00:08:10,897 --> 00:08:12,016
Dad took her to the hospital there.

92
00:08:12,096 --> 00:08:13,817
The queue was so long that people
were even lining up on the street.

93
00:08:13,897 --> 00:08:15,056
(We couldn't even get
a registration number.)

94
00:08:15,136 --> 00:08:16,537
Dad told me to hurry back and find you.

95
00:08:16,617 --> 00:08:18,176
I see. Ask Mrs He to go with you.

96
00:08:18,256 --> 00:08:19,377
Go get her now. Hurry up.

97
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:20,257
Okay.

98
00:08:21,856 --> 00:08:23,097
Miracle Doctor,

99
00:08:23,177 --> 00:08:25,256
can you come here
to provide consultations?

100
00:08:26,136 --> 00:08:28,576
(I'm overwhelmed here.
And it's untreatable.)

101
00:08:29,096 --> 00:08:30,657
You are the most respected doctor here.

102
00:08:30,737 --> 00:08:32,256
Everyone trusts you.

103
00:08:32,856 --> 00:08:34,897
If you come, half of the patients
will recover.

104
00:08:37,177 --> 00:08:38,337
Okay, Mr He.

105
00:08:38,617 --> 00:08:39,937
Don't worry. I'll pack my things.

106
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,390
I will be there as soon as I can.

107
00:08:41,908 --> 00:08:43,908
Okay. There are too many patients here.

108
00:08:44,096 --> 00:08:46,042
Can your girlfriend come along?

109
00:08:49,136 --> 00:08:50,377
She has something to attend to.

110
00:08:50,457 --> 00:08:51,536
I'll go alone.

111
00:08:52,457 --> 00:08:54,516
(Okay. Please come as soon as you can.
Thank you.)

112
00:10:06,136 --> 00:10:08,537
Do you have any idea
how serious this is?

113
00:10:14,217 --> 00:10:15,017
Say something!

114
00:10:15,977 --> 00:10:17,417
Mr Ren, I know I was wrong.

115
00:10:19,736 --> 00:10:21,417
Mr Wu said to me before,

116
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,759
"Li Quan,

117
00:10:24,616 --> 00:10:26,415
you have to go back to
the apprentice class.

118
00:10:26,775 --> 00:10:28,535
You can't forget
your original aspiration."

119
00:10:30,936 --> 00:10:32,417
I've been asking myself.

120
00:10:32,857 --> 00:10:33,657
I said,

121
00:10:33,936 --> 00:10:34,736
"Zhao Li Quan,

122
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,829
what is your original aspiration?"

123
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,721
I want to become a doctor.

124
00:10:41,297 --> 00:10:42,697
I want to provide

125
00:10:42,777 --> 00:10:43,930
a better life for my family.

126
00:10:46,315 --> 00:10:47,796
But I can't go back anymore.

127
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,999
Forget about being a doctor,

128
00:10:50,537 --> 00:10:52,316
you're not even being
a decent human being!

129
00:10:54,297 --> 00:10:56,176
If I report you now,

130
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,296
you'll be put behind bars immediately,
you know?

131
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,316
For the rest of your life,
you will carry

132
00:11:02,116 --> 00:11:03,556
the guilt of corruption, bribery,

133
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,041
and abuse of power.

134
00:11:05,537 --> 00:11:06,777
Your parents and your relatives

135
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:08,936
will be ashamed because of you.

136
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:12,263
Mr Ren,

137
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,241
you have to help me.

138
00:11:23,496 --> 00:11:24,417
Please help me.

139
00:11:26,217 --> 00:11:27,217
I have learned my lesson.

140
00:11:27,616 --> 00:11:29,017
Mr Ren, please help me.

141
00:11:29,995 --> 00:11:30,796
Please help me.

142
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,270
I have learned my lesson, Mr Ren.

143
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,680
I have learned my lesson.

144
00:11:42,736 --> 00:11:43,536
Turn yourself in.

145
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,080
You had the courage
to commit those acts.

146
00:11:47,176 --> 00:11:49,217
You should also have the courage
to admit them.

147
00:11:49,537 --> 00:11:50,896
Be responsible for your actions.

148
00:11:54,376 --> 00:11:56,217
Please give me another chance.

149
00:11:56,736 --> 00:11:57,736
Help me.

150
00:11:59,297 --> 00:12:00,376
Help me.

151
00:12:03,276 --> 00:12:06,256
If my parents and my village
find out about this, I'll be ruined.

152
00:12:07,297 --> 00:12:08,777
How will I live then?

153
00:12:11,376 --> 00:12:12,176
I beg you,

154
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,056
please help me.

155
00:12:14,657 --> 00:12:15,616
Help me.

156
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:16,830
You are responsible

157
00:12:16,977 --> 00:12:18,176
for your own actions.

158
00:12:20,417 --> 00:12:21,816
If you turn yourself in now,

159
00:12:22,857 --> 00:12:24,236
you will get a lenient sentence.

160
00:12:24,616 --> 00:12:26,256
If I report you,

161
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,159
the punishment will be even harsher.

162
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,759
Now that I know about what you did,

163
00:12:31,097 --> 00:12:32,816
I can't pretend I don't know.

164
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,040
How about this?

165
00:12:39,549 --> 00:12:40,768
Why don't you knock me out

166
00:12:41,657 --> 00:12:42,897
until I lose my memory too?

167
00:12:42,977 --> 00:12:45,316
This way, only you, the heavens,
and the earth will know,

168
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,659
and no one else.

169
00:12:46,803 --> 00:12:48,243
Mr Ren, please don't say that.

170
00:12:49,015 --> 00:12:50,256
I won't do it again.

171
00:12:51,736 --> 00:12:53,055
I won't do it again.

172
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,241
I'm sorry.

173
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,960
You know,

174
00:13:19,417 --> 00:13:20,576
I'm helping you.

175
00:13:21,097 --> 00:13:22,243
After you turn yourself in,

176
00:13:22,736 --> 00:13:23,977
I will bring you food.

177
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,081
Li Quan,

178
00:14:13,176 --> 00:14:15,376
do you hate me?

179
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,240
Master,

180
00:14:23,736 --> 00:14:24,736
I don't hate you.

181
00:14:26,176 --> 00:14:27,417
I'm grateful to you.

182
00:14:31,777 --> 00:14:33,977
This has been weighing on
my heart for a long time,

183
00:14:35,736 --> 00:14:37,176
like a big rock.

184
00:14:39,297 --> 00:14:41,256
It feels so much better
to finally tell someone.

185
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,360
That's good to hear.

186
00:14:58,297 --> 00:14:59,337
Go and turn yourself in.

187
00:15:01,376 --> 00:15:02,297
I will visit you.

188
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:04,536
Go.

189
00:15:55,056 --> 00:15:56,777
-Mr Ren.
-(He left.)

190
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:58,156
I saw it.

191
00:15:59,176 --> 00:15:59,976
Follow him.

192
00:16:01,417 --> 00:16:02,217
(Got it.)

193
00:17:18,657 --> 00:17:19,457
Hello?

194
00:17:19,777 --> 00:17:20,577
(Mr Ren,)

195
00:17:21,056 --> 00:17:22,575
(he didn't enter the police station.)

196
00:17:23,777 --> 00:17:24,577
Where is he going?

197
00:17:25,616 --> 00:17:26,416
I don't know.

198
00:17:29,736 --> 00:17:30,616
Keep following him.

199
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,280
What happened?

200
00:18:01,657 --> 00:18:02,777
He jumped into the river.

201
00:18:03,328 --> 00:18:04,369
I saved him.

202
00:18:10,537 --> 00:18:11,337
Leave us.

203
00:18:58,417 --> 00:19:00,456
You have the courage
to kill yourself.

204
00:19:04,297 --> 00:19:06,910
Why don't you have the determination
to change and start afresh?

205
00:19:07,657 --> 00:19:08,457
Mr Ren,

206
00:19:10,177 --> 00:19:11,057
I'm ashamed.

207
00:19:13,896 --> 00:19:15,102
It's too late for me go back.

208
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,959
The scoundrel you used to be

209
00:19:18,496 --> 00:19:19,657
is already dead in the river.

210
00:19:20,897 --> 00:19:23,256
From now on, sitting in front of me

211
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,040
is a completely transformed person,

212
00:19:25,897 --> 00:19:27,216
ready to start anew.

213
00:19:27,777 --> 00:19:28,577
Can you do it?

214
00:19:34,683 --> 00:19:35,483
Yes.

215
00:19:38,297 --> 00:19:40,003
Are you sure it's just 300,000 yuan?

216
00:19:44,136 --> 00:19:44,937
Yes.

217
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,766
I will lend you the money.

218
00:19:48,777 --> 00:19:49,856
Take the money

219
00:19:50,402 --> 00:19:51,202
and pay him back.

220
00:19:52,297 --> 00:19:53,817
This way, you can start anew

221
00:19:54,082 --> 00:19:55,202
with ease.

222
00:20:02,177 --> 00:20:03,336
Do you know

223
00:20:05,548 --> 00:20:08,188
how hard it is to cultivate a talent?

224
00:20:09,177 --> 00:20:12,856
They have to go through various tests.

225
00:20:13,537 --> 00:20:16,297
Some people fail in their tests.

226
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,160
That's why everyone

227
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,561
should have a mentor
to keep them company

228
00:20:30,056 --> 00:20:31,416
on their journey.

229
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,296
If someone falls behind,

230
00:20:33,376 --> 00:20:34,736
they can lend them a helping hand

231
00:20:35,256 --> 00:20:36,275
and keep moving forward.

232
00:20:36,976 --> 00:20:38,017
I hope

233
00:20:39,136 --> 00:20:40,435
you would take this as a lesson,

234
00:20:41,682 --> 00:20:42,723
learn from your mistakes,

235
00:20:43,136 --> 00:20:44,496
and strive for greater goodness.

236
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:47,162
Thank you, Mr Ren.

237
00:20:48,136 --> 00:20:49,109
Starting from tomorrow,

238
00:20:49,897 --> 00:20:51,137
you'll return to work
at the medical centre.

239
00:20:51,177 --> 00:20:52,436
You'll receive a basic salary.

240
00:20:53,417 --> 00:20:55,136
You will start

241
00:20:55,537 --> 00:20:56,937
as a herb collector.

242
00:20:57,496 --> 00:20:59,537
Forget about being a doctor for now.

243
00:20:59,897 --> 00:21:02,577
You need to understand
the spirit of craftsmanship

244
00:21:02,657 --> 00:21:04,203
before you can think about other things.

245
00:21:07,417 --> 00:21:08,217
I will work hard.

246
00:21:11,777 --> 00:21:13,136
Tian Zhen is now...

247
00:21:14,136 --> 00:21:16,736
We will see if we can
add another bed in the room.

248
00:21:17,856 --> 00:21:18,937
There are many herbs in there.

249
00:21:19,017 --> 00:21:20,536
You will work in the medical centre
during the day,

250
00:21:20,616 --> 00:21:21,416
at night,

251
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,189
you will organise the herb.

252
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:24,657
That is learning too.

253
00:21:25,136 --> 00:21:27,136
I have a place to stay now.

254
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,080
I just rented a room.

255
00:21:30,177 --> 00:21:31,456
I've paid three months' rent.

256
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,226
Why are you still hesitating then?

257
00:21:33,537 --> 00:21:35,176
There's something
I've been unable to understand.

258
00:21:35,256 --> 00:21:36,056
I'd like to ask you.

259
00:21:36,136 --> 00:21:36,936
Go on.

260
00:21:38,616 --> 00:21:40,096
You taught us that,

261
00:21:40,856 --> 00:21:41,656
"Given enough honesty,
there will be intelligence;

262
00:21:41,736 --> 00:21:42,537
given enough intelligence,
there will be honesty."

263
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,953
Honesty is the foremost principle
in being a person.

264
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,346
I've been your student
for quite a long time.

265
00:21:49,136 --> 00:21:51,976
I've been observing your actions
and behaviour for a long time,

266
00:21:53,017 --> 00:21:54,336
but I still can't figure it out.

267
00:21:56,376 --> 00:21:57,176
What is it?

268
00:21:59,017 --> 00:22:00,376
Your relationship with Tou Tou

269
00:22:01,496 --> 00:22:03,697
is not what people think it is, right?

270
00:22:06,417 --> 00:22:07,897
I am a mortal.

271
00:22:09,017 --> 00:22:10,417
And being a mortal,

272
00:22:11,256 --> 00:22:12,515
I am bound to be lost at times.

273
00:22:13,088 --> 00:22:15,261
Because I have experienced
the hardships of mortals,

274
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,040
I can understand your mistakes.

275
00:22:21,376 --> 00:22:22,937
Everyone makes mistakes.

276
00:22:25,657 --> 00:22:27,336
Throughout our life,

277
00:22:27,736 --> 00:22:29,297
we are constantly refining ourselves,

278
00:22:30,136 --> 00:22:31,456
striving to improve.

279
00:22:31,897 --> 00:22:33,603
It is important to understand ourselves,

280
00:22:35,068 --> 00:22:36,109
reflect on ourselves,

281
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,921
and then improve ourselves.

282
00:22:43,657 --> 00:22:44,777
Thank you for your guidance.

283
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,717
(Jiangzhou People's Hospital)

284
00:23:25,297 --> 00:23:27,937
Hello, Grandson. What's up?

285
00:23:32,376 --> 00:23:33,176
Tou Tou,

286
00:23:33,777 --> 00:23:36,129
I'm returning to the village
to provide free consultations.

287
00:23:37,777 --> 00:23:39,256
Why? What happened?

288
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,816
The flu has been rampant lately.

289
00:23:41,897 --> 00:23:44,056
Mr He asked me to go and help out,
to take a look.

290
00:23:47,775 --> 00:23:49,015
When will you be back then?

291
00:23:49,723 --> 00:23:51,576
If everything goes well,
three to five days.

292
00:23:51,657 --> 00:23:53,559
But if there are
any unforeseen circumstances,

293
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,183
it might take ten days to two weeks.

294
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,936
(Remember to switch shifts
with Yang Xiao Hong.)

295
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,400
I've also asked Wu Yu for a favour.

296
00:23:59,496 --> 00:24:01,657
He will join the rotation team.
He's reliable.

297
00:24:04,897 --> 00:24:05,817
I got it.

298
00:24:07,897 --> 00:24:08,697
Tou Tou,

299
00:24:09,017 --> 00:24:11,657
do you remember my grandpa's
old house, the one I told you about?

300
00:24:12,297 --> 00:24:13,976
(I cleaned it up.)

301
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,366
The key is in
the water meter box at the door.

302
00:24:16,897 --> 00:24:18,456
If you ever feel tired

303
00:24:19,182 --> 00:24:21,322
and don't feel like going home,
you can stay there.

304
00:24:21,496 --> 00:24:22,862
(Don't always trouble Xing Xing.)

305
00:24:25,096 --> 00:24:25,896
Okay.

306
00:24:26,017 --> 00:24:27,897
(Well, if there's nothing else,)

307
00:24:28,657 --> 00:24:29,496
(I have to go.)

308
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:31,177
Hang on.

309
00:24:36,256 --> 00:24:37,057
Stay safe.

310
00:24:37,537 --> 00:24:38,456
Okay, bye.

311
00:24:39,096 --> 00:24:39,896
Bye.

312
00:25:33,897 --> 00:25:34,697
Come, come.

313
00:25:35,376 --> 00:25:36,655
Madam, why did you move here?

314
00:25:37,496 --> 00:25:39,496
There are too many patients.

315
00:25:39,723 --> 00:25:40,962
When they heard you were coming,

316
00:25:41,096 --> 00:25:42,256
they all came to us.

317
00:25:42,376 --> 00:25:43,416
The village

318
00:25:43,496 --> 00:25:45,136
vacated the ancestral hall for us.

319
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:47,840
Madam,

320
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,600
my grandfather said
this year is a year of epidemic.

321
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,015
I brought some herb sachets.
They must be hung up promptly.

322
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,456
I also brought
some herbal medicine soup.

323
00:25:53,537 --> 00:25:55,776
Make sure everyone in the village
to take it in a timely manner.

324
00:25:55,856 --> 00:25:56,937
Okay, okay.

325
00:25:57,017 --> 00:25:58,457
Come on. Come with me.

326
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,720
Here, this way.

327
00:25:59,856 --> 00:26:00,656
Easy.

328
00:26:00,777 --> 00:26:01,577
Mr He.

329
00:26:02,216 --> 00:26:03,457
-You're here.
-I'm here.

330
00:26:08,537 --> 00:26:09,416
Your liver is not good.

331
00:26:09,937 --> 00:26:11,697
-How's your rest been lately?
-Not very good.

332
00:26:13,256 --> 00:26:14,376
Don't overexert yourself.

333
00:26:16,176 --> 00:26:16,976
Mr He, allow me.

334
00:26:17,657 --> 00:26:18,777
Dr Ren will take a look at you.

335
00:26:18,937 --> 00:26:20,056
-Hello, Dr Ren.
-Hello.

336
00:26:20,136 --> 00:26:20,936
Sit here.

337
00:26:22,096 --> 00:26:23,656
-What's your surname?
-Ye.

338
00:26:23,929 --> 00:26:25,089
How old are you?

339
00:26:25,456 --> 00:26:26,577
41.

340
00:26:28,136 --> 00:26:28,936
Let's see.

341
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,315
Please open your mouth.
Let me see your tongue.

342
00:26:35,496 --> 00:26:36,296
Okay.

343
00:26:43,417 --> 00:26:44,937
A few more to go.

344
00:26:45,256 --> 00:26:46,056
Hurry.

345
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,793
How's your sleep been?

346
00:26:59,136 --> 00:27:00,017
Not really good.

347
00:27:00,856 --> 00:27:02,702
Please open your mouth.
Let me see your tongue.

348
00:27:03,177 --> 00:27:03,977
Wider.

349
00:27:21,297 --> 00:27:22,097
Grandpa,

350
00:27:22,657 --> 00:27:24,036
I have a bad feeling about this.

351
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:25,776
Everyone's tongue coating
is very white and greasy.

352
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,160
The level of greasiness is alarming.

353
00:27:27,256 --> 00:27:28,495
The Right Cun is slippery.

354
00:27:29,017 --> 00:27:31,416
I have prescribed many medications,
but there's no improvement.

355
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,240
It's effective,

356
00:27:34,417 --> 00:27:35,450
but the symptoms recur.

357
00:27:37,417 --> 00:27:38,596
The illness is prolonged.

358
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:25,122
(During the periods of
Minor Cold and Major Cold,)

359
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,845
(it is generally
the coldest time of the year.)

360
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,741
(As the saying goes,
Minor Cold is between)

361
00:28:31,821 --> 00:28:33,160
(the second and third nine-day period,)

362
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,320
(it's so cold that
one shivers from head to toe.)

363
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:43,560
(Minor Cold)

364
00:28:56,736 --> 00:28:58,496
You still don't have a sense of smell?

365
00:28:58,577 --> 00:29:01,297
Yes, I still can't taste anything
when eating.

366
00:29:04,256 --> 00:29:06,017
Dr Ren! Dr Ren!

367
00:29:06,748 --> 00:29:07,601
Calm down, Tao Zi.

368
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,559
What's wrong? Is it Grandma again?

369
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,973
No, not Grandma.

370
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:11,963
It's Uncle Niu.

371
00:29:12,068 --> 00:29:13,029
Go and check on him.

372
00:29:13,177 --> 00:29:15,056
-Okay, I will go check on him now.
-Go.

373
00:29:15,496 --> 00:29:16,817
-Let's go.
-Okay.

374
00:29:28,017 --> 00:29:29,977
-Collect your medicine outside.
-Thank you.

375
00:29:30,177 --> 00:29:31,096
Come, come.

376
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,466
Is it your old ailment?

377
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,636
-How is your blood pressure?
-It's okay.

378
00:29:42,136 --> 00:29:43,335
My cough

379
00:29:44,417 --> 00:29:45,550
has gotten better,

380
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:47,897
but it gets worse at night.

381
00:29:49,136 --> 00:29:50,577
I had a slight fever

382
00:29:51,462 --> 00:29:52,623
when I woke up this morning.

383
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,080
Dr Ren,

384
00:29:55,856 --> 00:29:57,777
I actually felt better earlier.

385
00:29:58,376 --> 00:29:59,176
Maybe...

386
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:01,817
I... I think

387
00:30:01,897 --> 00:30:03,915
maybe I got a little tired
over the past few days.

388
00:30:04,657 --> 00:30:05,537
Besides,

389
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,079
at my age...

390
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,439
It takes longer

391
00:30:17,682 --> 00:30:18,963
for me to recover from a cold.

392
00:30:20,196 --> 00:30:20,996
I'm fine.

393
00:30:22,096 --> 00:30:23,297
No, you are not.

394
00:30:23,496 --> 00:30:25,096
You almost fell down just now.

395
00:30:28,937 --> 00:30:30,683
I felt a little dizzy for a few seconds.

396
00:30:31,537 --> 00:30:32,656
I really am fine.

397
00:30:32,736 --> 00:30:33,577
How are you fine?

398
00:30:33,657 --> 00:30:35,777
Huai told me to take good care of you
before he's admitted to the hospital.

399
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,160
If something happens to you,
what am I going to say to him?

400
00:30:38,256 --> 00:30:39,655
Who was admitted to the hospital?

401
00:30:40,897 --> 00:30:41,777
My son.

402
00:30:42,017 --> 00:30:44,657
He fell ill after he
came back from Wuhan.

403
00:30:45,375 --> 00:30:46,175
He is

404
00:30:46,496 --> 00:30:47,897
in the district hospital now.

405
00:30:48,376 --> 00:30:49,475
What did the hospital say?

406
00:30:49,703 --> 00:30:50,503
The doctor said

407
00:30:51,603 --> 00:30:52,403
he was fine.

408
00:30:53,496 --> 00:30:54,496
A few days of IV drip

409
00:30:54,657 --> 00:30:55,496
will cure him.

410
00:30:56,537 --> 00:30:57,697
How long ago was this?

411
00:30:59,376 --> 00:31:00,376
It has been a few days.

412
00:31:14,897 --> 00:31:15,697
Come here!

413
00:31:15,777 --> 00:31:16,856
Tian Zhen is calling.

414
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:18,296
Tian Zhen is calling?

415
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:19,176
Give it to me.

416
00:31:21,777 --> 00:31:22,657
Tian Zhen,

417
00:31:22,963 --> 00:31:24,442
(how have you been doing?)

418
00:31:25,017 --> 00:31:27,496
(Chinese New Year is approaching.
You should come home soon.)

419
00:31:29,062 --> 00:31:29,862
(Tian Zhen.)

420
00:31:30,297 --> 00:31:32,730
Mum, let me talk to Grandpa.
I have something urgent to ask him.

421
00:31:32,976 --> 00:31:34,897
I'm here. Yes?

422
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,400
(Grandpa, here's the thing.)

423
00:31:36,496 --> 00:31:37,697
(I can't go home for now.)

424
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,816
I have never seen
such a complex situation before,

425
00:31:39,897 --> 00:31:41,336
so I need your help to sort it out.

426
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,015
Do you remember what the situation
was like during the SARS outbreak?

427
00:31:44,096 --> 00:31:46,417
Your parents took the lead at that time.

428
00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:47,817
Come. Ling Lan, you talk to him.

429
00:31:50,496 --> 00:31:51,536
(Tell me about the situation.)

430
00:31:51,616 --> 00:31:53,657
Mum, my patients' high fever
isn't going down.

431
00:31:53,785 --> 00:31:55,625
I tried using a combination
of Maxing Shigan soup

432
00:31:55,736 --> 00:31:56,536
(and modified Xiaochaihu decoction,)

433
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,560
(but it only provides temporary relief.
The illness is prolonged.)

434
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,800
(Even in the early stages,
it comes on aggressively.)

435
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,456
(I've advised two patients to go
directly to the general hospital.)

436
00:32:03,537 --> 00:32:05,537
So, I wanted to ask
what it was like during SARS.

437
00:32:05,897 --> 00:32:07,616
The illness is now spreading in Wuhan.

438
00:32:08,136 --> 00:32:09,376
I'm getting a bit worried.

439
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:11,697
You can't handle it alone.

440
00:32:11,777 --> 00:32:12,897
(Come home now.)

441
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,057
Grandpa, they need me here.
I can't go home.

442
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:17,217
You brat,

443
00:32:17,297 --> 00:32:18,817
you never suffered from this before.

444
00:32:19,136 --> 00:32:20,376
(During the SARS outbreak,)

445
00:32:20,496 --> 00:32:21,937
(one of your mum's best friends)

446
00:32:22,017 --> 00:32:23,156
(got infected and died.)

447
00:32:23,417 --> 00:32:25,417
(You are our only grandchild.)

448
00:32:26,376 --> 00:32:27,177
Tian Zhen,

449
00:32:27,423 --> 00:32:28,823
come home.

450
00:32:29,177 --> 00:32:30,097
We will talk about it
when you come home.

451
00:32:30,177 --> 00:32:30,977
(Tian Zhen.)

452
00:32:31,405 --> 00:32:32,217
(Tian Zhen,)

453
00:32:32,297 --> 00:32:35,360
give me a day. I will get prepared.
I will be there tomorrow afternoon.

454
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,480
Text me the address.

455
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,120
(Okay, Dad.)

456
00:32:39,575 --> 00:32:40,695
He's going too?

457
00:32:42,256 --> 00:32:43,777
Tian Zhen, listen to me.

458
00:32:44,216 --> 00:32:45,616
(Be sure to always wear a mask.)

459
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:48,897
Also, the prescribed herbal decoction
needs to be taken three times a day.

460
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,816
I'll ask your dad
to bring some more over.

461
00:32:50,897 --> 00:32:52,656
Even those who haven't fallen ill
should drink it as well.

462
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:53,536
Got it?

463
00:32:53,657 --> 00:32:54,896
Got it, Mum. I will.

464
00:32:54,976 --> 00:32:55,776
I have to go now.

465
00:33:00,537 --> 00:33:02,056
What kind of mother are you?

466
00:33:02,136 --> 00:33:03,736
What if it really is SARS?

467
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,663
The SARS outbreak
was so severe back then.

468
00:33:05,897 --> 00:33:08,897
Didn't you also send
your own daughter to the front line?

469
00:33:10,976 --> 00:33:12,177
Tian Zhen is a doctor.

470
00:33:12,736 --> 00:33:14,729
This is when his skills
should be put to use.

471
00:33:18,136 --> 00:33:18,936
This is odd.

472
00:33:19,897 --> 00:33:20,697
I could bear

473
00:33:21,256 --> 00:33:22,256
to let my daughter go,

474
00:33:22,856 --> 00:33:24,569
yet I can't bear to let my grandson go.

475
00:33:35,777 --> 00:33:37,216
Look after the medical centre.

476
00:33:37,736 --> 00:33:39,177
It's difficult for us to know

477
00:33:39,297 --> 00:33:41,017
when this disease will reach Jiangzhou.

478
00:33:41,777 --> 00:33:43,017
Take stock of the masks.

479
00:33:47,017 --> 00:33:47,817
Easy.

480
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,442
Those who have a fever,
separate them with other patients.

481
00:33:51,897 --> 00:33:52,817
Here.

482
00:33:52,897 --> 00:33:53,910
I have already placed

483
00:33:54,376 --> 00:33:56,150
a large order
for anti-epidemic medicines.

484
00:33:56,496 --> 00:33:57,296
Put it here.

485
00:33:58,897 --> 00:33:59,697
Anything else?

486
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:01,976
No, just these few little bags.

487
00:34:04,017 --> 00:34:05,297
If there is a major outbreak,

488
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,840
our medical centre will immediately
prepare the medicine

489
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:10,175
and distribute it for free.

490
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,862
I want all the patients and
their families to have access to it.

491
00:34:12,976 --> 00:34:14,577
-Professor Ren...
-Hold on, let me think.

492
00:34:15,096 --> 00:34:15,976
What else is there?

493
00:34:16,976 --> 00:34:18,656
Why do you insist on leaving overnight?

494
00:34:18,736 --> 00:34:20,176
It would be much better to bring
a student with you tomorrow morning.

495
00:34:20,256 --> 00:34:21,962
You can take turns driving on the way.

496
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,440
No need. It should be fine.

497
00:34:26,017 --> 00:34:26,976
I can just use GPS.

498
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,239
Okay, go home.

499
00:34:29,496 --> 00:34:30,296
Okay.

500
00:34:30,376 --> 00:34:31,457
-Okay.
-Take care.

501
00:34:31,856 --> 00:34:33,296
-I'm leaving.
-Drive slowly.

502
00:34:33,376 --> 00:34:34,376
Be careful.

503
00:35:50,936 --> 00:35:51,736
Professor Ren,

504
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,120
I'm so glad you came.

505
00:35:54,842 --> 00:35:55,642
Where is Tian Zhen?

506
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,879
Tian Zhen took
Uncle Niu to the county town.

507
00:35:59,537 --> 00:36:01,136
I'm worried he can't make it.

508
00:36:01,216 --> 00:36:02,496
Uncle Niu's condition is critical.

509
00:36:02,777 --> 00:36:04,256
Why did he seek treatment so late?

510
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:06,176
It's not Tian Zhen's fault.

511
00:36:06,537 --> 00:36:08,456
It's mainly Uncle Niu's fault.

512
00:36:08,617 --> 00:36:10,216
He's reluctant to spend money.

513
00:36:16,097 --> 00:36:17,856
He's a really good doctor.

514
00:36:17,936 --> 00:36:19,202
It's not easy to invite him.

515
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,360
The password is six zeroes.

516
00:36:20,456 --> 00:36:21,736
The money inside is enough.

517
00:36:21,976 --> 00:36:23,496
Get someone to send this card to him.

518
00:37:05,216 --> 00:37:06,376
Look at him.

519
00:37:06,456 --> 00:37:07,377
He's so cool.

520
00:37:07,936 --> 00:37:09,576
He is a famous doctor, a great doctor.

521
00:37:09,656 --> 00:37:10,496
Of course he's cool.

522
00:37:11,777 --> 00:37:13,496
-I will go take a look.
-Okay.

523
00:37:41,896 --> 00:37:42,696
It's Xin Zheng.

524
00:37:46,936 --> 00:37:47,736
Master.

525
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,440
(Xin Zheng.)

526
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:51,377
I wrote a prescription

527
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,017
based on the situation.

528
00:37:53,656 --> 00:37:54,777
I've sent it to you.

529
00:37:55,377 --> 00:37:56,436
What do you think about it?

530
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,360
I've looked at it.

531
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,541
The dosage of Ephedra sinica

532
00:37:59,622 --> 00:38:00,822
is a bit too high.

533
00:38:00,936 --> 00:38:02,297
If the dosage is too high,

534
00:38:02,377 --> 00:38:03,496
it will affect sleep.

535
00:38:03,857 --> 00:38:05,136
Only with proper rest

536
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:06,456
(can the patient recover quickly)

537
00:38:06,896 --> 00:38:07,936
(and self-heal.)

538
00:38:08,109 --> 00:38:09,496
Got it, Master. I'll keep it in mind.

539
00:38:10,216 --> 00:38:11,216
How's the medical centre?

540
00:38:12,256 --> 00:38:13,256
How is Ling Lan?

541
00:38:13,696 --> 00:38:14,577
(We are doing good.)

542
00:38:14,696 --> 00:38:15,496
Don't worry.

543
00:38:16,857 --> 00:38:18,496
At your age,

544
00:38:18,976 --> 00:38:20,989
you still have to help out
in the medical centre.

545
00:38:21,777 --> 00:38:22,577
Don't say that.

546
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:24,176
Take care of yourself.

547
00:38:25,656 --> 00:38:27,256
Okay, I will.

548
00:38:27,857 --> 00:38:28,657
Don't worry.

549
00:38:29,216 --> 00:38:30,016
Okay.

550
00:38:30,256 --> 00:38:31,056
Bye.

551
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,560
Dad, Dad.

552
00:38:33,736 --> 00:38:34,536
Something happened.

553
00:38:36,216 --> 00:38:37,016
What is it?

554
00:38:38,137 --> 00:38:39,537
Uncle Niu's son has passed away.

555
00:38:39,777 --> 00:38:40,936
Drink slowly.

556
00:38:42,256 --> 00:38:43,057
How did it happen?

557
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,920
He went to the provincial capital
on his own,

558
00:38:45,017 --> 00:38:46,936
but the hospital there
was already overcrowded.

559
00:38:47,017 --> 00:38:47,817
He was still fine when he arrived there.

560
00:38:47,857 --> 00:38:50,496
But while waiting, he suddenly collapsed
and never woke up again.

561
00:38:52,617 --> 00:38:54,229
What is the situation in the hospital?

562
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,040
I asked my classmate.

563
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:57,256
It's a mess.

564
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,375
They lack manpower and protection.

565
00:38:59,456 --> 00:39:01,028
Many doctors have been infected.

566
00:39:10,416 --> 00:39:11,216
Tian Zhen,

567
00:39:11,377 --> 00:39:12,177
Grandpa

568
00:39:12,617 --> 00:39:13,696
has written a prescription

569
00:39:13,896 --> 00:39:14,976
for this illness.

570
00:39:15,416 --> 00:39:16,802
I will forward it to you later.

571
00:39:17,216 --> 00:39:18,016
Okay.

572
00:39:19,936 --> 00:39:20,936
This is a small place.

573
00:39:21,696 --> 00:39:23,322
The disease won't spread here for now.

574
00:39:27,595 --> 00:39:28,635
You will stay here.

575
00:39:30,635 --> 00:39:31,661
Where are you going, Dad?

576
00:39:38,936 --> 00:39:40,455
I'm going to the provincial capital.

577
00:39:46,097 --> 00:39:47,017
Hello, Kai.

578
00:39:48,577 --> 00:39:49,990
(Please give your order.)

579
00:39:51,176 --> 00:39:52,176
I want to make a call.

580
00:39:52,656 --> 00:39:53,656
Call Luo Yong Xin.

581
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,160
(Calling Luo Yong Xin)

582
00:40:01,543 --> 00:40:02,976
-Hello.
-(Mr Luo.)

583
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,800
(This is Ren Xin Zheng.)

584
00:40:05,322 --> 00:40:06,122
Ren,

585
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,273
we are facing a problem here.

586
00:40:08,617 --> 00:40:09,456
I know.

587
00:40:09,777 --> 00:40:10,577
Mr Luo,

588
00:40:11,216 --> 00:40:13,097
I'm on my way to Wuhan.

589
00:40:13,537 --> 00:40:14,890
How is the situation over there?

590
00:40:15,456 --> 00:40:16,616
(Not good. Don't come here.)

591
00:40:16,696 --> 00:40:18,136
Listen, many of our colleagues

592
00:40:18,216 --> 00:40:20,337
in the surgical department
have been infected.

593
00:40:21,736 --> 00:40:22,922
Internal medicine department?

594
00:40:23,416 --> 00:40:24,617
It's the same.

595
00:40:24,936 --> 00:40:26,336
(Medical supplies are scarce.)

596
00:40:26,416 --> 00:40:28,777
(The higher-ups are already
coordinating support.)

597
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:41,966
(Wuhan)

598
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:46,118
(Jiangzhou People's Hospital)

599
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:16,687
(Tian Zhen)
(Are you okay?)

600
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,280
(Hang in there!)

601
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,520
(All the best to you!)

602
00:41:54,416 --> 00:41:56,176
Is everything okay there?

603
00:41:57,135 --> 00:41:58,335
Everything's fine, right?

604
00:41:58,976 --> 00:42:00,817
By the way, can you help me ask

605
00:42:01,256 --> 00:42:02,056
about

606
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:03,769
today's treatment plan?

607
00:42:04,082 --> 00:42:05,602
He hasn't been replying my messages.

608
00:42:25,297 --> 00:42:26,777
It's already dark.

609
00:42:26,857 --> 00:42:28,480
Why haven't we started
the acupuncture treatment yet?

610
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,000
Master hasn't replied me yet.

611
00:42:31,097 --> 00:42:33,202
I still don't know
today's treatment plan.

612
00:42:34,017 --> 00:42:36,136
What plan?

613
00:42:36,216 --> 00:42:37,816
Isn't just inserting the needle
to the same spot?

614
00:42:37,896 --> 00:42:38,936
Just do the treatment.

615
00:42:39,513 --> 00:42:42,137
You need to stop depending on him.

616
00:42:42,936 --> 00:42:44,216
I'll teach you. Just do it.

617
00:42:47,142 --> 00:42:48,175
That's not a good idea.

618
00:42:51,216 --> 00:42:52,017
Child,

619
00:42:52,857 --> 00:42:53,856
my legs may be disabled,

620
00:42:53,936 --> 00:42:55,216
but my brain is not.

621
00:42:56,216 --> 00:42:59,175
You should know that your master
and I are fellow disciples.

622
00:43:00,496 --> 00:43:01,296
Okay.

623
00:43:02,896 --> 00:43:03,696
Then let me ask you,

624
00:43:05,297 --> 00:43:06,097
how did you fall?

625
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:10,669
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

626
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:12,150
(are referenced from relevant
traditional Chinese medicine books)

627
00:43:12,237 --> 00:43:13,560
(Do not use without medical advice)
