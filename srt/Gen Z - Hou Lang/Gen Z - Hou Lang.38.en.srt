1
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,797
(Jiangzhou People's Hospital)

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,440
You have to stop being
dependent on people.

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,560
I'll teach you, and you can
give me the acupuncture treatment.

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,400
That's not a good idea.

5
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,440
Child,

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,237
my legs may be disabled,

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,560
but my brain is not.

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,797
You should know that your master and I

9
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,240
were in the same sect.

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,800
Alright then.

11
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,160
Let me ask you something.

12
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,560
How did you fall?

13
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,477
I don't remember that.

14
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,797
You see? When I ask you,

15
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,960
you say you don't remember.

16
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,080
How should I know
if you can do acupuncture or not?

17
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,157
Why don't I recite the
Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic

18
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,120
for you?

19
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:46,960
If not,

20
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,517
why don't you test me
with the acupoints?

21
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,397
Enough.

22
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,400
Just rest well.

23
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,440
If Master doesn't reply to me

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,200
by 8pm,

25
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,280
I'll give you the same
acupuncture treatment as yesterday.

26
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,237
Be careful.

27
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,717
You're a loyal student

28
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,320
of his indeed.

29
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,440
Is it hot?

30
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,520
No.

31
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,360
Who's my mother?

32
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,400
Little Lark?

33
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:14,920
Who?

34
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,560
Fine.

35
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,760
When I ask you about something,

36
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:23,960
you don't remember.

37
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,157
And, I can't follow your bidding

38
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,040
without being worried.

39
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,277
We'll never

40
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,800
be on the same page.

41
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:33,320
We should stick to
your master's instructions.

42
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,640
If only he was the one
with amnesia instead.

43
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,320
I guess

44
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,240
you can make the call here.

45
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,277
Wait.

46
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,957
I can't even tell

47
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,280
if you're pretending to be dumb here.

48
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,040
Enough.

49
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,597
You have no idea what I'm saying

50
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,560
at all.

51
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,837
I don't know whether to act dumb or not

52
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,477
all because of

53
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,560
that master of yours.

54
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,520
Hurry up.

55
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,477
Help me make a call.

56
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,360
Ask Shen Xin

57
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,040
how my mother is doing.

58
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,160
What's with the shush?

59
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,440
Hurry and call her.

60
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,800
Don't waste any time.

61
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,840
Tian Zhen,

62
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,080
have you read the news?

63
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,120
(How's the situation over your side?)

64
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,117
(Are Mr Niu and his son)

65
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,397
(confirmed cases?)

66
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,480
Did you guys quarantine them?

67
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,120
I'm doing fine here. Mum, don't worry.

68
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,117
But we didn't manage to save

69
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,120
Mr Niu's son.

70
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,320
(Mr Niu is doing fine.)

71
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,880
(He's staying in
the provincial hospital for now.)

72
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,600
(How are you and my grandparents doing?)

73
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,157
We're doing fine. Don't worry about us.

74
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,240
(Is the situation in the town
under control?)

75
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,360
Yeah.

76
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,760
Dad is here.

77
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,437
He guided me after he came here.

78
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,000
The prescription he gave me
was right on point.

79
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,317
(I've already notified everyone)

80
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,320
(according to Dad's instructions.)

81
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,437
I told them not to come to us if
they're sick. I'll go to them instead.

82
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,400
Do you have enough face masks?
Do you need me to send more to you?

83
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,880
(Yeah, I brought a lot of them with me.)

84
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,080
Tian Zhen,

85
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,280
have you guys run out of medicine?

86
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,237
(Chinese New Year is nearing.)

87
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,597
(I wonder if the courier company)

88
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,597
(will cease operation by then.)

89
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,678
(We'll send some to you.)
(And,)

90
00:03:06,761 --> 00:03:08,237
the flu sachet

91
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,157
is pretty effective.

92
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,200
Do you keep it on?

93
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,320
Yeah, I do.

94
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,680
I've been keeping it on. Look.

95
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,880
-(It's over here.)
-Tian Zhen,

96
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,160
listen.

97
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,517
Judging from the circumstances,

98
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,597
it's not realistic for you to come back.

99
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,080
You must take good care of yourself.

100
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,400
Luckily, your father is there with you.

101
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,880
(We can rest at ease now.)

102
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,440
Take care of yourself.

103
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,840
Tian Zhen,

104
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,320
tell your father to talk to me.

105
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,597
Dad doesn't allow me to.

106
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,000
Now, we need to maintain
social distancing.

107
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,480
Where is he?

108
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,117
(He's living in the opposite room.)

109
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,400
(Our rooms aren't next to each other.)

110
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,797
Take a photo

111
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,840
and show it to me.

112
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,677
Mum, if you're looking for him,

113
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,157
you can call him directly.

114
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,240
(You don't need to go through
all this trouble.)

115
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,000
Ren Tian Zhen.

116
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,200
Where's your father?

117
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,840
(Don't lie to me. Tell me the truth.)

118
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,120
(Dad went to Wuhan.)

119
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,040
What?

120
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,157
That's a huge deal!

121
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,237
Why didn't he notify us

122
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,280
beforehand?

123
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,800
You two, stop calling him.

124
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:26,920
Hello?

125
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,080
Have you reached Wuhan?

126
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,200
(Yeah.)

127
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,280
I've reached Wuhan.

128
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,640
Many of our peers are infected.

129
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,640
(We're lacking in medical supplies.)

130
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,040
(What about this?)

131
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,680
Get some face masks

132
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,077
and sanitisers for me.

133
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,480
(Let's close
the medical centre for now.)

134
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,677
(Get more face masks)

135
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,880
(and send them here.)

136
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,197
They're barely taking

137
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,680
any protective measures here.

138
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,040
Okay, I understand.

139
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,960
I'll do an inventory count now.

140
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,680
What about this?

141
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,960
You can keep one or two boxes

142
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,280
for Master and Madam.

143
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,597
You don't need to care about us.

144
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,000
Just take good care of yourself.

145
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,797
Yeah, forget about us.

146
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,000
You're on the frontline.

147
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,200
Safety first, you hear me?

148
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,720
I heard Master's voice.

149
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,160
Ling Lan,

150
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,120
I'll leave Master and Madam to you.

151
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,680
I'll leave our family

152
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,600
to you.

153
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,280
Don't worry.

154
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,680
Take good care of yourself.

155
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,560
Don't worry.

156
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,200
A patient is coming. I'll hang up now.

157
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,560
Okay. Goodbye.

158
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,680
Hurry!

159
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,880
Someone!

160
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,640
Dad, Mum,

161
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,237
I've decided to bring
Xin Zheng's parents

162
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,280
here.

163
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,840
I'll bring Tou Tou here too.

164
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,040
Ling Lan,

165
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,680
I support your decision.

166
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,077
I will arrange Tou Tou

167
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,520
to pick up Grandpa and Granny in Yunnan.

168
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:03,840
After that,

169
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'll head to the medical centre

170
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,360
and prepare to close it down.

171
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,920
I'll check on

172
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,320
Shan Dao too.

173
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,800
Is Tian Zhen coming back?

174
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,760
He's my son.

175
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,280
I'll make the call.

176
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,160
This is a crucial moment to see if

177
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,000
he can establish a foothold in medicine.

178
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,080
And, if he stays at Hubei,

179
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,320
he can assist Xin Zheng

180
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,120
when it's necessary.

181
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,480
-I'll make the preparations then.
-Okay.

182
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,160
Hello?

183
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,360
Tou Tou,

184
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,280
where are you?

185
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,720
This is my daughter indeed.

186
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,640
She never panics during
such important moments.

187
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,600
She's my daughter too.

188
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,160
She did

189
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,880
take after me.

190
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,960
(Major Cold represents)

191
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,160
(the extremely cold weather.)

192
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,840
(Once Major Cold is over,)

193
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,080
(winter will pass, and spring will come)

194
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,560
(Thus, a new cycle begins.)

195
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:16,000
(Major Cold)

196
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:24,960
Ren,

197
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,040
I'm afraid

198
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,760
we can't treat this disease in time

199
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,440
if we have to wait for Western medicine.

200
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,840
We need to depend on

201
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:31,917
TCM for this.

202
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Let's use both acupuncture
and Chinese medicine.

203
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,560
It'll definitely work.

204
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,720
Mr Luo, were you looking for me?

205
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,320
Mr Wang, let me introduce him to you.

206
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,517
This is

207
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,637
Professor Ren Xin Zheng from

208
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,600
Jiangzhou University
of Chinese Medicine.

209
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,797
This is the head of the
Internal Medicine Department,

210
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,760
Wang You Ming.

211
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,920
Nice to meet you, Mr Wang.

212
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,077
So, you're the famous Professor Ren.

213
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,196
You flatter me.

214
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,317
I read your books before.

215
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,797
And, Luo kept telling me

216
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,840
about your legendary tales.

217
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,797
Thank you

218
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,480
for coming all the way here

219
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,600
when we're having a tough time.

220
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,320
You flatter me.

221
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,720
How's the situation here?

222
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,840
It's bad.

223
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,077
We used Azithromycin,

224
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,080
Moxifloxacin Hydrochloride tablets,

225
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,680
expectorant,

226
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,960
and even Chinese medicine.

227
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,200
Now, it seems like

228
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,000
Diammonium Glycyrrhizinate

229
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,197
is a little effective.

230
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,200
However, we're not sure.

231
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,560
By the way, when I was doing my rounds,

232
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,480
a patient told me that he felt
much more comfortable

233
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
after receiving acupuncture treatment.

234
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,637
It felt as if a heavy rock

235
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,680
has been lifted from his chest.

236
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,800
I was beside Professor Ren just now.

237
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,197
Right after he delivered
the acupuncture treatment,

238
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,360
the patient said

239
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,677
he felt much better.

240
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,560
Yeah.

241
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,440
I don't understand

242
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,957
TCM at all.

243
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,080
We Western doctors

244
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,280
haven't even figured out the virus.

245
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,400
However,

246
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,160
you already started to treat them.

247
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,277
The thing is,

248
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,277
the patient said it was effective

249
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,840
after receiving
the acupuncture treatment.

250
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,400
Is this a case of

251
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,757
placebo treatment?

252
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,997
In my opinion,

253
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,960
Western medicine studies

254
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,400
the sicknesses that humans have

255
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,960
while Chinese medicine studies

256
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,800
humans who are sick.

257
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,600
Virus is just like a seed.

258
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,240
If a seed wants to sprout,

259
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,600
it needs a suitable environment,
soil and temperature.

260
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,240
I don't care what kind of seed it is.

261
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,437
If I ruin

262
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,360
its growing environment,

263
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,520
the virus will vanish.

264
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,160
So, you're saying

265
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,400
that the growing environment for viruses

266
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,040
is the human body, right?

267
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,600
That's completely right.

268
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,080
If the body is cold, make it warm.

269
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,877
If the body is hot, cool it down.

270
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,077
There's no need to
inquire about the sickness.

271
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,800
Balance in all things.

272
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,317
When a patient is sick,

273
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,757
they don't feel it.

274
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,517
As long as they pull through
the most dangerous moments

275
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,640
and let their immunity grow,

276
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,360
their bodies

277
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,640
will recover naturally.

278
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,160
That's right.

279
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,400
-I have a favour to ask of you.
-Please speak up.

280
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,560
Our hospital

281
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,040
is already at maximum capacity.

282
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,360
And, the community is still sending
more and more patients here.

283
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,280
Look.

284
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,726
-Our Inpatient Department
-Yeah.

285
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,920
is barely 300 meter square,

286
00:09:55,073 --> 00:09:56,196
but we have so many patients here.

287
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,197
Even if they aren't sick,

288
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,480
they'll be infected eventually.

289
00:09:59,446 --> 00:10:01,280
A patient told me

290
00:10:01,546 --> 00:10:03,346
that you were quick in administering
your acupuncture treatment.

291
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,040
I was thinking

292
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,277
that if you could

293
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,520
help out our community as well

294
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,600
so that our pressure
could be alleviated.

295
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,920
Of course, they lack
basic supplies there.

296
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,160
It'll be even tougher than here.

297
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,560
Please consider it.

298
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,080
If you agree to it,

299
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,040
I'll introduce you to them.

300
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,400
No problem.

301
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,400
No problem.

302
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,600
This is great.

303
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,757
This is great.

304
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,437
Professor Ren, thank you so much.

305
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,557
-Don't mention it.
-Thank you.

306
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,397
-It's what I should do.
-Thank you.

307
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,757
You're doing us a huge favour.

308
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,760
It's my job.

309
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,920
(Qibo Medical Centre)

310
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,320
Today's the last day
for the city express service.

311
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,197
We have to go on a break

312
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,320
after packing these goods.

313
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,800
-(Li Quan.)
-Hello, Mr Ren?

314
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,120
(How are things over there?)

315
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,480
I'm doing fine.

316
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,800
Have you found the reason
you came in the first place?

317
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,520
Mr Ren, what do you mean by that?

318
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,560
If there's a tough battle ahead,

319
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,240
will you be willing to join us?

320
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,080
Of course.

321
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,520
I lack manpower here.

322
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,437
If this is something like SARS,

323
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,880
it'll be a matter of life and death.

324
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,040
Mr Ren,

325
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,840
I already died once.

326
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,440
(You were the one who rescued me.)

327
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,120
(I'm not afraid of death itself,)

328
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,360
(let alone this disease.)

329
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,640
Good.

330
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,160
(My wife has already prepared)

331
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,200
(the necessary materials
to fight against)

332
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,360
the epidemic.
You...

333
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,160
You can drive Yang Xiao Hong's car here.

334
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,000
Okay.

335
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,680
Thank you.

336
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,520
Mr Ren,

337
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,080
I should be thanking you instead.

338
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,920
-Was it Professor Ren?
-Yes.

339
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,920
Mr Ren told me to head to Wuhan.

340
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,960
You can take my car then.

341
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,277
It can fit more medical supplies.

342
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,240
Yeah.

343
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,800
Okay.

344
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,040
What are you doing here?

345
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm heading to Wuhan soon.

346
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,200
I'm here to visit you.

347
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,400
Wuhan?

348
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,040
Have you lost your mind?
Didn't you read the news?

349
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,317
Even experts said that we should
avoid going there.

350
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,720
Why must you go there?

351
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,720
Mr Ren needs all the help he can get.

352
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,157
Why must it be you

353
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,280
when there are other people
in the medical centre?

354
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,760
I have to go.

355
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,317
And, I don't know

356
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,520
when I'll be back.

357
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,800
I'm here to bid farewell to you.

358
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,960
We brewed this
herbal medicine soup ourselves.

359
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,840
Remember to take it.

360
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,400
Oh yeah.

361
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,360
I made

362
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,240
a scented sachet for you.

363
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,080
See you.

364
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,957
(January 23rd, 10am,)

365
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,637
(passages out of Wuhan
were blocked off.)

366
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,640
(Staying united,
combating the epidemic.)

367
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,957
(Wuhan is the city of heroes.)

368
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,240
(They will pull through.)

369
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,717
(During Chinese New Year's Eve,)

370
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,520
(planes are heading
toward Wuhan instead.)

371
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,640
(The most outstanding doctors)

372
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,000
(the most advanced equipment,)

373
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,517
(and the urgent supplies
they need have been gathered.)

374
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,357
(The cure rate,)

375
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,157
(lowering the infection rate
to the minimum,)

376
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,040
(fatality rate...)

377
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,320
(Everyone takes a part in fighting
the epidemic, no visitors allowed)

378
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,080
Those who are well-versed
in administering acupuncture treatment

379
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,640
treat the right with the left

380
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,240
and treat the left with the right.

381
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,077
Once you find the position,

382
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,360
you just need to confirm
the meridian you're targeting.

383
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,960
It's that simple?

384
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:25,880
Yes.

385
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,160
You see, acupuncture is easy to learn

386
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,920
and hard to forget.

387
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,120
It's as if a splinter in the flesh,
a polluted material,

388
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,680
a knot,

389
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,120
and a blocked stream.

390
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,840
It's that simple.

391
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,000
In a family setting,

392
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,720
we can use fingers instead of needles.

393
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,840
If we teach the patients how to do it,

394
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,640
they won't need to visit the hospital.

395
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,160
Professor Ren,

396
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,877
thank you.

397
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,960
Don't mention it.

398
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,000
Professor Ren,

399
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,877
I think

400
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,197
we're witnessing history here.

401
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,160
That's right.

402
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,040
Is that boy

403
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,360
your son?

404
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,840
He's a pretty filial child.

405
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,840
He's my student.

406
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,200
He's just like my son.

407
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,920
My son

408
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,317
is treating patients

409
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,680
in a village in Hubei.

410
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,757
You're a kind Samaritan.

411
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,800
Your entire family

412
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,517
are kind Samaritans.

413
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,280
Thank you for the compliment.

414
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,080
I'll get you some Chinese medicine.

415
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,000
Rest well.

416
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,600
Professor Ren,

417
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,077
what are you feeding

418
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,400
my husband with?

419
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,997
This is a herbal medicine soup
I prescribed to combat the epidemic.

420
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,200
You have to drink it too.

421
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,640
Here you go.

422
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,637
Thank you.

423
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,920
Professor Ren.

424
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:43,960
Come here for a second.

425
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,800
Professor Ren,

426
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,757
I know that TCM focuses on

427
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,280
observation, auscultation and olfaction,
inquiry, and pulse reading.

428
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,957
But now, we don't even know

429
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,160
what the virus is about.

430
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,397
Yet, you're feeding them
herbal medicine soup.

431
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,080
And, all of them are taking
the same soup.

432
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,877
I'm afraid this doesn't make sense.

433
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,437
I have no time to explain it to you.

434
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,517
You can take it if you're willing.

435
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,197
Look at how many patients
we have out there.

436
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,400
And, it's cold.

437
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,437
Their condition will worsen

438
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,680
when they queue outside.

439
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,080
You can make the call yourself.

440
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,320
But...

441
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,640
How do you feel?

442
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,840
Dad, Mum, it's cold outside.

443
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,197
I brought you two back with me

444
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,800
as this year is pretty hectic.

445
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,680
Okay.

446
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,197
You guys haven't met
your granddaughter yet, right?

447
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,360
Granddaughter?

448
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,920
Tou Tou.

449
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,560
Come and greet your grandparents.

450
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,520
Hello, Grandpa, Granny.

451
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,760
I'm Mr Ren's student.

452
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,157
I'll leave your luggage here.

453
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,120
I'll make a move first.

454
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,040
This girl is something else.

455
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,400
Tou Tou!

456
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,800
-Tou Tou!
-I'm going to visit Senior Uncle.

457
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,637
Over here.

458
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,157
Send it to Mr Ren right now.

459
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,437
They're in urgent need of it.

460
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,400
-Okay?
-Okay.

461
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,600
And,

462
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,400
you shouldn't place the goggles here.

463
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,077
You shouldn't put something
on top of them.

464
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,557
Put them at the top.

465
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,317
-Okay.
-That's right.

466
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,320
Get this moved up.

467
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,920
Thank you.

468
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,160
Let me check this side.

469
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,677
By the way, has Tian Zhen contacted you?

470
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,800
Do they need any supplies?

471
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,197
He's doing fine over there.

472
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,440
It's a small village after all.

473
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,360
Now, our main focus is Wuhan.

474
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,757
Li Quan told me

475
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,757
that even a piece of dust sheet

476
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,720
is precious to them.

477
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,160
Our medical team

478
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,040
will be bringing everything
we can bring to them.

479
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,760
Wait, didn't you join the medical team?

480
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,797
I did register my name.

481
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,120
But they rejected me.

482
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,197
Those on the medical team

483
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,277
are from the Department of
Infection Control, Pulmonology,

484
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,240
Anaesthesiology, Intensive Care,
and so on.

485
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,077
I'm sure there will be sick children
over there too.

486
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,480
Somehow, they don't need someone
from the Department of Paediatrics.

487
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,520
If I must say,

488
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,400
besides their departments, their status
should be considered too.

489
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,797
A loner like me

490
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,917
without any commitments

491
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,760
should be prioritised
and sent to the frontline.

492
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,760
Nonsense. What are you saying?

493
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,360
All volunteers

494
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,000
will depart safely

495
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,077
and return safely.

496
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,437
Look at what you're saying.
You're making it as if

497
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,317
no one

498
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,600
cares about you.

499
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,917
Yeah, you're right.

500
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,037
Everyone has to be safe

501
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,000
and sound.

502
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,840
I just think that this is the moment

503
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,920
I've been waiting for

504
00:18:59,040 --> 00:18:59,920
when I decided to study medicine.

505
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,197
Now that I think about it,

506
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,360
it would've been a success for me

507
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:05,877
to take care of myself

508
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,120
before I studied TCM.

509
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,720
But now that I've studied TCM,

510
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,237
I try to dedicate myself

511
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,120
to the well-being of the public.

512
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,517
Dedicate yourself to the well-being
of the public?

513
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,037
You're learning TCM with your own money.

514
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:15,960
You're resting on
your past achievements.

515
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,917
Alright. What about this?

516
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,120
You can go ahead.
I'll settle the delivery fee.

517
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,600
No need to go. Come back.

518
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,960
I went there already.

519
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,760
They said the delivery fee will
be waived if they are to be delivered

520
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
to the epidemic zone.

521
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,880
Really?

522
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,837
Mr Ren, I'll tend to it.

523
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,880
You should take a nap.

524
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,520
Tend to your pots.

525
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,800
It's been a few days since you rested.

526
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,157
You're not made of iron.

527
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,040
You should take a nap.

528
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,080
Leave this to me.

529
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,280
It's a race against time.

530
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,080
Every second counts.

531
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,600
Mr Ren, please listen to me.

532
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,240
It's been a few days since you slept.

533
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,360
Don't talk to me.

534
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,120
I still need to reply to
Tou Tou's text later.

535
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,877
I need to tell her the treatment plan
for Wu Shan Dao.

536
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,560
Tou Tou should be asleep by this time.

537
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,600
She won't go to sleep
before answering my call.

538
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,120
-Mr Ren, I'm begging you...
-Get back to work.

539
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,760
Dear.

540
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,960
I brought your parents
from Yunnan to our home.

541
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,797
The four elders are staying together.

542
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,760
They can take care of each other.

543
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,400
Dear, it must've been tough on you.

544
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,637
Initially, I wanted to

545
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,917
bring Tou Tou back too.

546
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,880
But she's not willing to come back.

547
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,800
She said she wanted
to take care of Wu Shan Dao.

548
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,000
(Just ignore her.)

549
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,240
(Let her be.)

550
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,640
How's the situation over there?

551
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,760
(Did they seal off the city?)

552
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,520
(Do you guys lack any food supplies?)

553
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,600
It's terrible here.

554
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,800
What about the family?

555
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,240
I just had to fight for food

556
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,360
every 12am.

557
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,520
That's all there is to it.

558
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,280
Our community has sealed off
the entrance.

559
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,200
No one is allowed
to enter or exit the area.

560
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,160
(Do you need me to send
more students there to help you?)

561
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,157
Just stay at home

562
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,120
and don't go anywhere.

563
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,760
That's the biggest help you can offer.

564
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,400
(Ren Xin Zheng)

565
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,637
The patients on this name list

566
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,880
have to be transferred to
a Grade A tertiary hospital by today.

567
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,477
There's no way to do so.
They don't have any space over there.

568
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,880
If so, the first three must be
transferred there.

569
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,000
All three of them
must be transferred there.

570
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,240
There's no way to do so.

571
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,080
You're coughing?

572
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,640
I'm fine.

573
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,760
There are too many patients there.

574
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,760
I won't joke around with my health.

575
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,360
You should go.

576
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,120
Alright. I understand.

577
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,600
Take care, okay?

578
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,880
I'll get you some herbal medicine soup.

579
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,880
Here you go.

580
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,240
Okay.

581
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,040
I was waiting for this.

582
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,200
What's wrong with you?

583
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,880
Are you coughing as well?

584
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,640
Come, let me check your pulse.

585
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,760
Lower your volume.

586
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,280
Don't let him hear that.

587
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,520
How long has it been
since you started coughing?

588
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,520
Were there any symptoms?

589
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,040
Not too long ago.

590
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,600
My chest just feels stuffy.

591
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,160
You mustn't tell him about it.

592
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,160
You mustn't.

593
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:29,840
Don't worry.

594
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,960
You need acupuncture treatment.

595
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,240
This is quite a huge deal.

596
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,120
Okay.

597
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,440
Later,

598
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,960
I'll receive the treatment
in the corridor.

599
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,037
Once he's hospitalised,

600
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,880
I'll get myself quarantined
in the mobile cabin hospital.

601
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,280
I'll be fine by then.

602
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,120
I've also received

603
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,160
notice of quarantine from
the mobile cabin hospital.

604
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,840
They said

605
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,560
I could be admitted tomorrow.

606
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,600
What a beautiful sunrise.

607
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,360
I just don't know

608
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,520
if this will be my last time

609
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,160
seeing the sunrise.

610
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,200
What's wrong with you?

611
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,360
What's wrong with you?

612
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,640
Professor Ren!

613
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,557
What did you say?

614
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,760
Your father fainted?

615
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,040
Did he get infected?

616
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:04,957
Li Quan said he gave him the test.

617
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:05,920
It wasn't the coronavirus.

618
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,280
He thinks that
Dad is just too exhausted.

619
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,877
(He did everything himself.)

620
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,160
(His body is heaty.)

621
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:12,440
If so,

622
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,600
does he have a fever?

623
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,000
(Yes, he has a high fever.)

624
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,960
(Even so, he still insists on
brewing the medicine himself.)

625
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,877
Dr Ren!

626
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,400
(Tell your father
to take the test again.)

627
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,640
The first test might not be accurate.

628
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,000
Mum, I'll hang up first.
There's a patient coming in.

629
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,360
What's the matter?

630
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,640
Did Xin Zheng get infected?

631
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,680
You should head there then.

632
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,720
Head to where Xin Zheng is.

633
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,360
You've been distracted

634
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,160
for the past few days.

635
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,880
Your heart is with him.

636
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,040
Go now.

637
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,080
He...

638
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,160
He doesn't allow me to go.

639
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,120
So what?

640
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,160
You're a doctor.

641
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,600
You should go.

642
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,960
Right now, our country
needs all the talent they can get.

643
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,040
But what about you guys?

644
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,160
Your father and I are perfectly healthy.

645
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,800
Don't worry.

646
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,880
Xin Zheng already
entrusted his parents to me.

647
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,600
We'll take care of them.

648
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,877
Your father and I have been practising
medicine for 60 years.

649
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,880
Why are you still worried about us?

650
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,720
That's not it.

651
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,040
What's the issue then?

652
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,917
Wuhan has been sealed off.

653
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,280
How can I get inside?

654
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,760
You're making me panic.

655
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,080
Do you want to go there or not?

656
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,000
It's easy then.

657
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,437
When there's a will,

658
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,400
there's a way.

659
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,000
It's easy for you to say.

660
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,000
This is the invitation letter
sent to our medical centre

661
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,800
by Jiang'an District's local authority.

662
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,320
Take this with you.

663
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,920
Your mother and I

664
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,077
have dealt with the procedures

665
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,560
two days ago.

666
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,160
Go now.

667
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,080
Hurry up.

668
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,600
Alright now.

669
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,520
Don't worry about the family.

670
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:45,557
(Jiangzhou People's Hospital)

671
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,040
(Master, can you see this?)

672
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,000
(Can you see this?)

673
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,160
(Look.)

674
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,600
(Look!)

675
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,120
He can stand now?

676
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,237
(Yeah. He stood up all of a sudden.)

677
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,077
(I was surprised.)

678
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,277
I was taken aback.

679
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,200
Look.

680
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,797
(Tell him to be careful.)

681
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,157
Now,

682
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,437
he lacks a braincase.

683
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,360
You need to put a helmet on his head.

684
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,157
Got it.

685
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,760
I'll let him choose the colour
when I head back.

686
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,160
He can choose it himself.

687
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,720
By the way, Master...

688
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,400
Be careful.

689
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,840
(You see, when we first worshipped
our predecessors,)

690
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,557
(you said spring was here)

691
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,040
even though the temperature was low.

692
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,157
However, the air of spring

693
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,520
is different from the air of winter.

694
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,677
(Back then, I thought you were
spouting nonsense.)

695
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,120
(Spring and winter together? Nonsense.)

696
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,677
(But today,)

697
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,120
(I feel the air of spring.)

698
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,400
That's good.

699
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,840
Tell me then.

700
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,120
How do you feel?

701
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,480
(Well,)

702
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,760
(today's the Beginning of Spring.)

703
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,520
At night, it felt damp.

704
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,917
Maybe it's because

705
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,520
the air on the ground became warm.

706
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,557
That means

707
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,160
you didn't lie to me.

708
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,480
It wasn't me.

709
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,400
(It was Heaven and Earth.)

710
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,000
So, Heaven and Earth never lie, huh?

711
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,000
As fall departs without return,

712
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,400
spring falls as the next season.

713
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,520
You two are uncultured.

714
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:12,840
Shan Dao.

715
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,360
You old ingrate.

716
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,360
So,

717
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,277
(you're forgetting about
the person who treated you)

718
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,400
now that you've almost
fully recovered, huh?

719
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,000
(Precisely.)

720
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,480
(Tou Tou, you've improved a lot.)

721
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,640
Your sense

722
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,480
has been sharpened by a lot.

723
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,040
You're much more observant

724
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,760
(of your surroundings now.)

725
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,200
Wait, Master.

726
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,360
Why are you coughing?

727
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,280
It isn't coughing season yet.

728
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,240
(Don't tell me you're infected?)

729
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,120
Mind your words.

730
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,800
(I feel unwell today.)

731
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,360
(I'll hang up first.)

732
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,360
(I'm not done yet.)

733
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,680
Hello?

734
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,840
That was fast.

735
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,000
Senior Uncle,

736
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,677
I feel

737
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:18,920
uneasy.

738
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,800
Don't tell me
Master is infected?

739
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,880
Stop jinxing him.

740
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,586
He won't get infected.

741
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,120
Don't worry.

742
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,600
That's the situation.

743
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,040
I'll depart for Wuhan immediately.

744
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:45,917
(As for the medical centre,)

745
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,397
(Xiao Hong, Zhu Xia,)

746
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,760
(please take care of it.)

747
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,200
Ms Song, don't worry.

748
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,480
(The medical centre is closed.)

749
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,560
(Everyone will stay at home)

750
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,557
(if they have nothing to do.)

751
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,880
(We won't go outside for no reason.)

752
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,197
Madam, remember to keep in touch.

753
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,120
You must take care of yourself too.

754
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,797
(If you need any help)

755
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,360
(or have encountered any issues,)

756
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,517
(just tell us.)

757
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,600
(We'll think of something.)

758
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,600
If we find something

759
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,277
that's effective,

760
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,760
we'll share it in the group chat.

761
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,640
(Do we have any confirmed cases
in the medical centre?)

762
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,000
Not yet for now.

763
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:15,957
However,

764
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,597
I do have some friends
who live near Wuhan.

765
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,277
Anyway, they're getting infected

766
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,360
one by one.

767
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,277
(There are also sporadic cases)

768
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,520
(appearing overseas right now.)

769
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,200
(I'm very worried.)

770
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,120
You don't need to worry.

771
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,120
Jiangzhou is still safe.

772
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,120
(That's not what I'm worried about.)

773
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,437
Now, I have a sense of

774
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,320
helplessness.

775
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,277
You guys are already on the frontline,

776
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,200
yet we can only

777
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,809
stay here.

778
00:33:37,893 --> 00:33:40,053
We don't know how we can
help you guys out too.

779
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,480
I have an idea.

780
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,720
Tell Ms Song then. Here.

781
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,800
(Ms Song, Hong,)

782
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,160
(I have an idea.)

783
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,840
You see, I have a chat
group with my fellow patients.

784
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,437
We cheer each other up

785
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,920
in the group.

786
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,037
(However,)

787
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,720
(everyone is panicking lately.)

788
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,640
(And, some of them have
already been infected.)

789
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,797
(They couldn't find any places
that could treat their condition,)

790
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,157
(especially when they are just like me,)

791
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,160
who experiences issues
in moving from one place to another.

792
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,360
And, some of them are abroad too.

793
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,957
They're very scared.

794
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,557
Can we gather

795
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,477
all those who're infected

796
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,957
(and couldn't find a place)

797
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,157
(to treat their condition?)

798
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,237
(The physicians in our medical centre)

799
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,240
(are at home anyway.)

800
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,317
(Why don't we provide them)

801
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,277
with some help and assistance online?

802
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,237
At least

803
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,157
we shouldn't let them feel

804
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,360
that as if they've been abandoned.

805
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,840
(I think that's a great idea.)

806
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:30,917
(If we do so,)

807
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,237
(at least we can provide them)

808
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,800
(with some mental support.)

809
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,160
However, it's best
if we have a Western doctor too.

810
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,280
We can combine both fields.

811
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,240
Why don't I call
Peng Shi Yan to join us?

812
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:40,560
(Okay.)

813
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,517
Yang, for this activity,

814
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,840
you and Peng will lead it.

815
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,120
Call Tian Zhen to join you guys too.

816
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,640
Tian Zhen has practical experience.

817
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,680
He can share them with the group.

818
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,237
(Anyway,)

819
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,717
(we need to do everything we can)

820
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,360
(to help out those in need.)

821
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,517
Okay.

822
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,997
Madam, take care.

823
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,760
I'll contact them now.

824
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,480
Alright, Ms Song.

825
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,880
This is a great idea.

826
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,720
I'll create a group chat later.

827
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,237
Remember to take
your protective measures

828
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,480
when you're there.

829
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,080
I'll create the group now.

830
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:16,960
(Edit group chat name)

831
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,760
(Coronavirus Support Group)

832
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,120
(Hi, everyone. I'm Dr Peng.
I will try my best to help you all.)

833
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,040
(Wuhan Second Yangtze River Bridge)

834
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,640
What are you doing here again?

835
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,680
Go now.

836
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,000
I'm fine here.

837
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,480
Get back to work.

838
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,800
Mr Ren.

839
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,720
Wait.

840
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,240
What are you doing here?

841
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,640
Our family is doing fine.

842
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,160
Don't worry.

843
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,600
-Okay.
-Don't worry.

844
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,320
That's a serious cough you have there.

845
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,560
I'm fine.

846
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,160
I already did the test twice.

847
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,760
It was negative both times.

848
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,080
Judging from the sound of your cough,

849
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,080
it sounds like a lung abscess.

850
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,800
I have too many patients

851
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,520
to tend to.

852
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,040
I know.

853
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:53,840
I'm here.

854
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,400
Leave your patients to me.

855
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,760
Okay.

856
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,760
(Song Ling Lan)

857
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,320
(Jiangzhou People's Hospital)

858
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,277
I recorded a set of hand techniques
that can help to stop coughs.

859
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,920
I'll send it to the group later.

860
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,477
And, I'll add Ms Dong

861
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:25,317
into the group later

862
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,960
so that she can guide the members.

863
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,197
Tell all patients in the group

864
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,240
to practice it.

865
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,640
There's no prescription at all.

866
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,720
Peng Shi Yan said

867
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,997
that it's time for Wang Shu Qing

868
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,400
to take his antibiotics.

869
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,477
There are no antibiotics here.

870
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,600
We only have hand techniques.

871
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,037
Tell him to get to work first.

872
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,477
Tell him to not let
his imagination run wild.

873
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,800
It'll make things worse.

874
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,560
Give him a hot water foot bath later.

875
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,840
Alright, got it.

876
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:00,800
That's all for now.

877
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,877
You're slacking off

878
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,077
when I'm not monitoring you, huh?

879
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,477
This is exhausting. Let me take a break.

880
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,400
No breaks for you.

881
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,620
-Come on.
-Okay.

882
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,760
How could you rest when you
just started? Come, let's continue.

883
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:12,917
Your tummy

884
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,277
is getting bigger and bigger.

885
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,200
Hurry up.

886
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,880
(Tian Zhen, grab a pen
and a piece of paper.)

887
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,240
(Write down the prescription.)

888
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,640
Please go ahead.

889
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,920
(Chinese ephedra, six grams.)

890
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,640
(Poria cocos, 15 grams.)

891
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:27,960
(Almond, nine grams.)

892
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,560
(Chinese Thorawax Root, 15 grams.)

893
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,840
(Scutellaria baicalensis, six grams.)

894
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,400
(Prepared Liquorice Root, five grams.)

895
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,400
(Raw ginger,)

896
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,400
(ten grams.)

897
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,320
This is a prescription
specifically for the epidemic.

898
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,680
I asked my father already.

899
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,000
He said we could
roast brown rice until it

900
00:40:44,094 --> 00:40:45,358
turns golden brown and
make porridge with them.

901
00:40:45,441 --> 00:40:46,397
It invigorates the spleen
and dispels dampness.

902
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,640
It's helpful against this illness.

903
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,317
I'll organise it into an article

904
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,200
and publish it
on the public account right away.

905
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,400
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

906
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,920
(are referenced from relevant
traditional Chinese medicine books)

907
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,360
(Do not use without medical advice)
