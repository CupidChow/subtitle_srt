1
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,920
My mother-in-law is waiting outside.

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:07,997
She has taken her blood pressure pill,

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,797
but her blood pressure
is still over 200.

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:10,680
Tell me,

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,280
do you have the courage to go out

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,317
and tell her to give up on her son?

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,200
We might...

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,880
We might lose two lives then.

9
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,320
Don't worry.

10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,720
If the surgery fails,

11
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,640
I won't blame you.

12
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,960
The worst case scenario is

13
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,040
he will become a vegetable, right?

14
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,000
I will accept it.

15
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,400
Mr Li,

16
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,000
what are the chances
of my mentor waking up?

17
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,920
Let me put it this way.

18
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,760
Even if he wakes up,

19
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,920
he won't be the same as before.

20
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,840
Xin.

21
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,640
-Xin.
-What happened?

22
00:01:29,272 --> 00:01:30,992
Our company has a project
with the school.

23
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,797
I went to see Mr Wu
to get his signature for the contract.

24
00:01:33,881 --> 00:01:34,921
I found him on the floor

25
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,040
when I entered his office.

26
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,037
How long has Mr Wu been unconscious?

27
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,240
I don't know.

28
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,000
But I called the emergency service
immediately when I found him.

29
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,280
I don't know.

30
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,640
(In Operation)

31
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,640
Here, eat up.

32
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,280
How did it go, son?

33
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,160
Will your teacher lend us some money?

34
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,440
Let our son finish dinner first.
Why are you being so impatient?

35
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,680
Of course you are patient.

36
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,400
Of course you can wait.

37
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,280
It's not your phone that the lawyer and
the insurance company have been calling.

38
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,720
We've been here for three days.

39
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,197
He claimed his friend was a lawyer,

40
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,637
and his teacher would lend us money.

41
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,520
Where is the lawyer?

42
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,277
-Where is the money?
-That's enough.

43
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,797
What's the use of raising this son?

44
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,437
All you do is complaining.

45
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,437
Stop blabbering.

46
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,157
You don't understand.
He's got money.

47
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,640
He's living in such a big house
alone in this big city.

48
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,117
He just doesn't want to give us money.

49
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,717
He's been going in and out for days,
yet he didn't even bring home a penny.

50
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,797
That's enough. Stop it.

51
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,400
You can't blame him.

52
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,357
We are in such a big trouble.
Who else can we rely on?

53
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,400
Who else if not him?

54
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,160
Stop nagging.

55
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,960
I'm sick of waiting.

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,800
300,000 yuan.

57
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,880
You see, I told you he's got money.

58
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,077
And you didn't believe me.

59
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,000
Quan,

60
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,200
where...

61
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,280
Where did you get so much money from?

62
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,880
-I borrowed it.
-Borrowed?

63
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,597
But how are you going to repay

64
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,240
such a large sum of money?

65
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,560
My company will give me a big bonus
at the end of the year.

66
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,760
I'll use that to repay it.

67
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,120
What company?

68
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,440
Aren't you working
at the medical centre?

69
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,920
Who cares?

70
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,477
This will solve our problem.

71
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,160
Solve our problem?

72
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,400
Look at our son,

73
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,200
he was hiding his money from us.

74
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,960
All you care about is money.

75
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,360
Give me the card. Give it to me.

76
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,957
If we have to live in poverty
our whole lives, so be it.

77
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,357
But we can't add to his burden.
Give me the card.

78
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,877
You just don't understand.
We have a big trouble now.

79
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,640
-Who else can we rely on if not him?
-You can't do this.

80
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,680
Let's go back and
talk to the village chief.

81
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,360
We'll rent a land
and mortgage the fish pond.

82
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,720
Are you crazy?

83
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,240
I dug that fish pond with my own hands,
shovel by shovel.

84
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,440
I got all kinds of ailments
because of it.

85
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,157
This pond is my life.

86
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,077
We can't let them have it so easily.

87
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,640
-Give me the card!
-Don't move.

88
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,277
Our son needs this money
to buy a house and get married.

89
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,560
-Let go.
-Give it to me.

90
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,000
Quan.

91
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,320
-Quan.
-Let go.

92
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,800
You are not making
a sensible choice.

93
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,120
The surgery was successful,

94
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,437
but why isn't he

95
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,880
waking up by now?

96
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,157
I already told you about
the possible risks before the surgery.

97
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,637
The current situation
is already relatively ideal.

98
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,360
Okay, I understand.

99
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,757
But you

100
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,240
Western medicine doctors said
that you've done everything you could.

101
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,317
Why can't I try other methods?

102
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,960
-Why can't we give it a try?
-He just had his surgery.

103
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,837
It's the critical period for him.

104
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,717
Just wait a little longer
and be patient.

105
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,157
It's not the time to panic
and seek random medical treatments.

106
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,437
Li, Li.

107
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,637
Please calm down.

108
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,477
(Grandma Wu)
This is not random medical treatments.

109
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,757
Yes.

110
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,997
We just want to explore

111
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,840
if there are any other options.

112
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,880
I'll take responsibility
if anything goes wrong.

113
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,040
All right?

114
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,000
I'm a doctor just like you.

115
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,480
Let me in.

116
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,960
Let you go in?

117
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,280
Not a chance.

118
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,200
I know you will perform acupuncture
on him when you go in.

119
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,037
His blood pressure
is so unstable right now.

120
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,400
You need to let him recuperate first.

121
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,557
Don't stimulate him for the time being.

122
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,037
If your acupuncture treatment
goes wrong,

123
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,317
if he has another haemorrhage,
we'll have a trouble then.

124
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,800
Isn't he already in trouble now?

125
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,080
Shen Xin,

126
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,520
I've done everything I could.

127
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,600
You make the call.

128
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,560
Let's be rational.

129
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,037
I admit that you, Ren Xin Zheng,
are highly skilled in medicine.

130
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,717
However, at this point,

131
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,560
whether it's TCM or Western medicine,

132
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,920
they can't make much of a difference.

133
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,480
Go and check on him.

134
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,480
Please leave.

135
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,080
-You should leave.
-Li.

136
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,000
-I...
-Whether you allow it or not,

137
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,280
we are going in the ICU today.

138
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,120
It's already a desperate situation.
We have to try everything we can.

139
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,640
Li,

140
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,280
the surgery is done.

141
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,800
Whether the outcome is good or bad,

142
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,760
-I accept it.
-You can't accept it.

143
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,840
Your husband is the principal of
University of TCM.

144
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,797
Not only does he have to stay alive,

145
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,197
he will recover and

146
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,600
get back to teaching everyone.

147
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,640
Yes, that's what I mean.

148
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,840
Don't worry.

149
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,360
This is Shao Dao's pre-destined ordeal.

150
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,920
He needs to get through it on his own.

151
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,640
We don't want him to spend the
rest of his life lying in bed, do we?

152
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,080
Yes.

153
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,560
You have a good heart.

154
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,280
Your teacher must be proud
to have a student like you.

155
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,320
No matter what,

156
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,760
you have to let my master go in
and check on him today.

157
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,160
Child,

158
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,040
it's not that I don't believe in TCM.

159
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,040
It's just that he has
just undergone a major surgery.

160
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,560
His blood vessels are fragile.

161
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,837
It would be better
to wait until he's out of

162
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,277
the critical period before
performing acupuncture.

163
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,960
-No.
-I absolutely trust in TCM.

164
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,440
I'm just concerned about
the risk of a secondary rupture.

165
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,960
We need to use a dual approach.

166
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,837
The sooner we do acupuncture,

167
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,717
the faster his consciousness
will recover.

168
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,877
But the risk is high.

169
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,120
That's his fate.

170
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,600
Let them go in.

171
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,437
-Shen Xin.
-Mum.

172
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,280
Shan Dao is your husband.

173
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,040
He's also my son.

174
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,800
I know you're thinking of me,

175
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,560
which is why you insisted on
performing the surgery.

176
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,240
But now, I have to think of you too.

177
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,720
I can't let you handle this burden

178
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,480
for the rest of your life.

179
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,240
No, Mum.

180
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,600
Leave this to Xin Zheng.

181
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,280
Madam.

182
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,160
Madam.

183
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,000
Don't worry.

184
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,160
I will leave him to you.

185
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,800
If anything goes wrong,

186
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,680
I will take the responsibility.

187
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,720
Thank you.

188
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,840
I will go in now.

189
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,160
-Thank you.
-Ren, Ren.

190
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,560
Are you confident?

191
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,037
Yes.

192
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,717
Child, we think the same way.

193
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,080
Yes, first you have to believe,

194
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,480
and then you will see.

195
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,560
Tou Tou, go get changed.

196
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,440
I know where the room is.

197
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,520
Mr Ren,

198
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,080
let me go in.

199
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,400
You should stay here.

200
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,157
There is too little room in there.

201
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,400
Wait outside.

202
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,040
But Mr Wu is my mentor.

203
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,600
I'll get anxious out here
if I don't take a look at him.

204
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,120
You are a good student.

205
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,240
You should stay here

206
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,760
with your mentor's wife and mother.

207
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,360
Mr Ren,

208
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,240
you should let Tou Tou
stay here with them.

209
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,480
I will go in with you.

210
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,397
After I go in,

211
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,280
I won't talk and do anything. Okay?

212
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,280
You can't go in.

213
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,160
Why can't I go in?

214
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,280
Ren.

215
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,720
Ren.

216
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,240
Li Quan is Shan Dao's student.

217
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,797
It's only right to let him go in.

218
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,797
Don't take away his chance
to show filial piety.

219
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,680
Ren, let him go in.

220
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,160
I've heard about him.

221
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,157
Wu mentioned him to me before.

222
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,160
He's quite attentive to him.

223
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,120
Thank you, sir.

224
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,240
(Jiangzhou People's Hospital)

225
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,800
Tou Tou, look at the spot
where I inserted the needle.

226
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,560
You will do this next time.

227
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,917
Tou Tou, stop inserting the needle.

228
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,200
His blood pressure is rising.

229
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,200
Mr Ren, this is too dangerous.

230
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,200
What is going on?
Where is Zhao? Why isn't he here?

231
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,840
He took a half day off

232
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,480
to visit his teacher in the hospital.

233
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,437
All right.

234
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,720
Get back to work.

235
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,160
What's going on?

236
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,320
The manager has come
looking for him three times.

237
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,077
It must be about Mr Wu.

238
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,520
As you know, we have
a good relationship with Mr Wu.

239
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,837
We were hoping to get on

240
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,000
the procurement list for University
of Chinese Medicine Affiliated Hospital.

241
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,120
Now this is great.
Mr Wu has fallen ill.

242
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,000
I don't know what will happen next.

243
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Zhao,

244
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,797
what took you so long?

245
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,760
Come here now.
I have something to ask you.

246
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,800
Where have you been?
I've been waiting for you.

247
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,000
Walk faster.

248
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,160
You see, I was right, wasn't I?

249
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,400
This is pretty good.

250
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,480
Give me another one.

251
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,920
Zhao, tell me now.

252
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,240
How was it?

253
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,840
What do you mean?

254
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,960
Mr Wu's surgery was successful.

255
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,720
He is still in a coma.

256
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,840
He will probably stay in a coma
for a while.

257
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,037
I'm not asking you about his condition.

258
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,320
I meant the contract.

259
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,800
I didn't see the contract.

260
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,120
You didn't see it?

261
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,160
What about the card?

262
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,040
I gave it to him. You knew that.

263
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,680
The card is gone too?

264
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,400
Everything is gone.

265
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,400
All my efforts have gone to waste.

266
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,480
I can't believe this.

267
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,560
I'm so unlucky.

268
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,600
Hang on.

269
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,840
Didn't you have a chance
to ask him about it?

270
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,680
Answer me.

271
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,800
Mr Wu was already lying on

272
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,480
the floor when I walked in his office.

273
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,360
He was unconscious.

274
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,640
How could I ask anything?

275
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,800
Zhao,

276
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,000
this is what you will do.

277
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,880
Go to the bank and check

278
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,277
if any money has been
withdrawn from the account.

279
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,560
If nothing has been taken,

280
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,360
quickly report it as lost.

281
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,917
Lock the funds

282
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,040
and then reapply the card

283
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,280
to retrieve the money.

284
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,400
Based on what I know about Mr Wu,

285
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,800
we might

286
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,040
still have a chance
to recover the money.

287
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,800
Go and take care of it.

288
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,760
Let me know if there's any update.

289
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,920
Well, go now. Don't just sit there.

290
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,360
Okay.

291
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,440
Jian Xi,

292
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,357
besides the cool sensation
in your feet,

293
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,960
do you feel anything in other areas?

294
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:06,880
No.

295
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,640
I only felt that once.

296
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,760
I have been feeling nothing after that.

297
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,080
The medicine is not hot anymore.
Here, drink it.

298
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,357
Come, get up.

299
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,277
Let me help her.

300
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,160
Let me.

301
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,800
Okay.

302
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:23,960
Jian Xi.

303
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,960
I don't want to drink it.

304
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,080
Come on, drink it.

305
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,120
I said I don't want to.

306
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,000
Mum, do you really think
this medicine is effective?

307
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,320
I will never stand again.

308
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,760
I've taken the medicine,
tried the local remedies,

309
00:16:39,851 --> 00:16:41,569
had acupuncture,
and received massages,

310
00:16:41,653 --> 00:16:43,645
but I don't feel anything at all.

311
00:16:44,733 --> 00:16:45,796
Jian Xi,

312
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,120
this medicine was personally
prescribed by Professor Ren.

313
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,957
The herbs were prepared by
Tou Tou and Tian Zhen.

314
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,357
Decocted by Yang Xiao Hong.

315
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,040
Don't underestimate
this small bowl of liquid.

316
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,160
It carries everyone's hope.

317
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,560
Come on, drink it.

318
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,320
No.

319
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,037
We still need to
go through this process.

320
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,880
Let's complete this process.

321
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,480
If it works, that's great.
If not, we'll accept it.

322
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,440
Right?

323
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,440
Come on, drink it.

324
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,360
Here.

325
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,240
I know

326
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,760
you have the thought of dying again.

327
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,840
You don't want to burden me,

328
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,717
and you don't want to be paralysed
like this for the rest of your life,

329
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,600
right?

330
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,600
But you can't leave, you know?

331
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,240
If you left,

332
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,557
wouldn't that be punishing

333
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,160
all of us who love you?

334
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,280
I used to resent it,

335
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,960
thinking that life was unfair to me.

336
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,520
Why is it that other people's children
can work, date,

337
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,760
get married, have children,

338
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,277
while my daughter has to be paralysed
in bed for a lifetime,

339
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,320
and I have to take care
of her every need.

340
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,360
But now, I don't resent it anymore.

341
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,760
I'm actually grateful.

342
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:04,957
It shows that

343
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,800
the bond between us, mother
and daughter, is incredibly strong.

344
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,640
That's why fate has kept you by my side,

345
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,160
accompanying me every day.

346
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,280
Tell me,

347
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,160
which other mother is as lucky as me?

348
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,320
That's right, Jian Xi.

349
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,280
Don't worry.

350
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
The accident was caused by Cheng Ying.

351
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,040
Your mum shouldn't bear it alone.

352
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,840
Cheng Ying and I have talked about this.

353
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,600
We've agreed that
as long as we are still here,

354
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,280
the three of us will take care
of you for the rest of your life.

355
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,517
Me too, me too.

356
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,440
I will take care of you too.

357
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,960
You two are together now?

358
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:01,880
Jian Xi,

359
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,640
you need to have faith in yourself.

360
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:07,317
You felt a slight improvement before.

361
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,880
I'm sure that wasn't an illusion.

362
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,720
You are gradually recovering.

363
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,720
You should believe in
what Ms Dong said.

364
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,120
It's called a spiral upward.

365
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,920
Even stepping back

366
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,800
is a form of progress.

367
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,720
Actually, I'm quite grateful
to Cheng Ying's ex-husband.

368
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,120
He was with such a good woman.

369
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,840
Yet he didn't cherish her.

370
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,680
Fine.

371
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,720
He gave me a chance
to take care of her.

372
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,720
Wu Yu,

373
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,160
you are a real man.

374
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,320
Don't worry.

375
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,040
We will create a miracle with you.

376
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,120
Yes, create a miracle.

377
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,960
That's right. A miracle.

378
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,160
Drink your medicine.

379
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,800
Here.

380
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,760
Quan,

381
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,157
you are home early today.

382
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,160
No overtime?

383
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,240
Yes, I'm not working overtime today.

384
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,197
Mum, I noticed that you've been

385
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,000
withdrawing all the money
little by little every day.

386
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,440
(How did it go with the fish pond?)

387
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,960
Listen, Quan,

388
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,037
that friend you introduced

389
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,437
is really capable.

390
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,760
(He brought the person)

391
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,557
(who fell into the pond)

392
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,600
(in broad daylight)

393
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,200
to our house today.

394
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,160
His attitude

395
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,080
has completely changed.

396
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,640
(He is willing to settle)

397
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,080
(and bear some of the losses)

398
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,320
(of our fish pond.)

399
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,520
He's so capable.

400
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,917
He also told us

401
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,160
not to worry

402
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,160
and said that the other two
will withdraw their lawsuits soon.

403
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,320
That's good.

404
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,600
Is the money enough?

405
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,157
It's more than enough.

406
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,197
There will be some left.

407
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,640
Your dad said to return
the remaining money to you.

408
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,560
It's okay, Mum.

409
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,440
Keep the money.

410
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,120
Use it to repair the house with my dad.

411
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,280
Also, hire some people
to clean up the fish pond.

412
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,600
Don't let Dad do it alone.

413
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,480
Quan, this money is not a small amount.

414
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,160
Don't give it all to us.

415
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,240
Keep some for yourself, got it?

416
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,760
It's okay, Mum.

417
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,080
I can earn it back.

418
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,800
Ask my brother to study well.

419
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,840
I have to go.

420
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,160
Morning, Mr Li.

421
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,560
You are here so early.

422
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,437
You're such a good student,

423
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,760
reporting in every day.

424
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,480
Have you visited him?

425
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:49,840
Not yet.

426
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,720
I want to talk to you first.

427
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,160
How can I help you?

428
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:55,920
Well, Mr Li,

429
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,837
I want to know about

430
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,557
my mentor's recent condition.

431
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,917
Haven't Mr Ren and Tou Tou
been giving him acupuncture?

432
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,880
Has it been effective?

433
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,760
Currently, the results are
not very noticeable.

434
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,680
Although all the vital signs
have stabilized,

435
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,157
he hasn't regained consciousness.

436
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,480
It's been more than ten days.
As you know,

437
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,360
the longer a person remains in a coma,

438
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,640
the less likely they are to wake up.

439
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,320
Do you think

440
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,280
there's still a chance
for him to wake up?

441
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,200
Zhao,

442
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,960
we've done everything we could.

443
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,360
Sir,

444
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:38,200
please give me an accurate assessment.

445
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,560
I need to know what I can say to
his wife and mother.

446
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,280
Let me put it this way.

447
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,600
Brain damage is usually permanent.

448
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,280
Even if he wakes up one day,

449
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,760
he won't be the same as before.

450
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,000
I understand.

451
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,040
Go see him.

452
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,800
Thank you.

453
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,677
Mrs Wu, these are 1,000
origami cranes folded by

454
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,960
students from our undergraduate,
master's, and doctoral years.

455
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,080
Each crane represents
our wishes for Mr Wu.

456
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,760
We hope that Mr Wu can wake up soon.

457
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,200
You can give it to me.
I will take it in later.

458
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,077
Mrs Wu, and this. Look.

459
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:27,957
These are

460
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,200
photos of us with Mr Wu.

461
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,640
I made it into a video,

462
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,717
with his favourite song
playing in the background.

463
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,680
You can place it by his bedside.

464
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,157
And he will receive
our heartfelt message

465
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,120
of longing for his return to the school.

466
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,560
Okay.

467
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,640
Thank you.

468
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,840
You all are truly thoughtful.

469
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,240
Knowing that his students

470
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,837
care so much

471
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,120
about him,

472
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,960
Mr Wu will regain consciousness.

473
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:55,880
Wu Shan Dao's family,

474
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,957
please go downstairs
to make payment.

475
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,560
-Coming right away.
-Leave these to me.

476
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:00,840
Thank you, Tou Tou.

477
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,680
When did you make this?

478
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,040
Recently.

479
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,040
And you did such a good job.

480
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,677
And you put so many people in here.

481
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,560
Li Quan?

482
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,440
What are you doing here?

483
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,917
I brought a token of good gesture
for Mrs Wu on behalf of our friends.

484
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,824
I was just about to leave.
I have classes.

485
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,917
By the way, I've been
wanting to ask you.

486
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,157
Mr Wu was still fine
when we went to see him that day.

487
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,880
How did he fall down?

488
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,920
-You still have classes, right?
-Hang on.

489
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,680
You two went to see Mr Wu together?

490
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,520
Yes. Li Quan and I went in together.

491
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,917
But I just went in
to pass him some documents.

492
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,397
I left after I delivered the documents.

493
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,400
So,

494
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,960
I didn't see

495
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,240
how Mr Wu fell down.

496
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,760
Don't make blind assumptions
if you didn't witness it.

497
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,760
Maybe he didn't just slip and fall.

498
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,197
It could be caused by
a ruptured blood vessel,

499
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,160
understand?

500
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,440
It's a chicken and egg situation,
which came first?

501
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,720
Okay, I'm off to class then.

502
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,320
Tou Tou,

503
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,437
Mr Ren said he changed
his treatment solution today.

504
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,320
Tell me about it.

505
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,720
Tou Tou.

506
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,560
Tou Tou.

507
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,160
I'm here.

508
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,040
Sun Tou Tou,

509
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,760
You two are showing off your love,
even on my turf.

510
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,517
I'm already full just by watching you.

511
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,080
You guys are outrageous.

512
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,037
-Where is he?
-He's not here.

513
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,480
He's downstairs. He can't get in.

514
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,440
I'm going to have breakfast.

515
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,400
Why are you here so early today?

516
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,120
I'm worried about Mr Wu's condition.

517
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,920
So, I came here early.

518
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,160
Don't worry too much about Mr Wu.

519
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,317
Tou Tou told me that

520
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,320
Mr. Ren is very experienced
and has confidence.

521
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,880
He will wake up soon.

522
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,520
Can you tell me

523
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,000
what else she told you?

524
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,680
Tou Tou.

525
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,240
How is Mr Wu in these few days?

526
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,040
Nothing's changed.

527
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,640
I heard from Mr Ren

528
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,680
that he should recover soon.

529
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,640
We will do our best,
the rest is up to fate.

530
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,157
Actually, you don't have
to come here every day.

531
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,640
Once there is good news,
I will share it in the chat group.

532
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,360
What's going on?

533
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,520
What's wrong? What happened?

534
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,400
What did you do?

535
00:27:59,080 --> 00:27:59,880
Nothing.

536
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,280
Then, how come...

537
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,040
His blood pressure has soared to 190.

538
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,160
This is a good thing.

539
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,440
It means he is responding
to the outside world.

540
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,160
This response is too intense.

541
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,437
I will arrange for administration
of blood pressure medication.

542
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,557
Don't stay here.

543
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,437
-You all should go out first.
-Okay, okay.

544
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,800
Why are you still sitting there?

545
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,880
It's gone?

546
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,320
When did it happen?

547
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,280
Just two days ago.

548
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:40,240
I'm so unlucky. I can't believe
this would happen to me.

549
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,240
Hang on.

550
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,920
He's lying in the hospital.

551
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,800
How did the money go missing?

552
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,360
There is no way
he would tell other people about this.

553
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,360
Maybe Mrs Wu took it.

554
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,640
Think about it.

555
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,557
Mr Wu is currently in the ICU,

556
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,240
and it costs over 10,000 yuan per day.

557
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,077
Their family is in need
of money right now.

558
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,757
If his wife knew the password,
she would definitely withdraw the money.

559
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,680
How did she know that the password
is the last six digits of your ID?

560
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,560
As soon as I got the card,
I changed it to six zeros.

561
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,197
I thought it was convenient
for them to withdraw money.

562
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,320
I told Mr Wu about it,

563
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,960
and he probably told his wife too.

564
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,600
No way.

565
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,960
He would actually
share such things with his wife?

566
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,560
Oh my goodness, I can't believe
there are men like this.

567
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,040
Zhao, this is what you will do.

568
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,880
When you go to the bank,

569
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,960
tell them that you lost the card.

570
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,277
Then, you found out that
someone withdrew the money

571
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,800
when you checked the record.

572
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,800
Ask the bank to pull the surveillance
footage to see who took it.

573
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,560
I refuse to believe

574
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,120
that we can't recover this money.

575
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,680
Isn't that inappropriate?

576
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,120
What if Mr Wu wakes up?

577
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,840
Will we still be able
to continue this business?

578
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,200
It's you who said he won't wake up,

579
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,520
and it's also you
who said he will wake up.

580
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,317
Which possibility is more likely?

581
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,240
Sir,

582
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,760
this is what I think.

583
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,480
Mr Wu is currently going through
a life-and-death situation.

584
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,557
Considering our friendship,

585
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,877
can't you just let it go
as an act of kindness?

586
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,397
Do we really have to pursue this matter?

587
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,280
No,

588
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,760
I can't just give away 300,000 yuan.

589
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,277
Go and check the surveillance footage.

590
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,560
I need to know the truth.

591
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I want to see if it's his wife
who took the money.

592
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,520
Okay, I will get it done.

593
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,400
But Sir, you better think it through.

594
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,040
Mr Wu is still the principal.

595
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,797
If he wakes up one day

596
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,680
and finds out what you did
behind his back,

597
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,720
then...

598
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,200
Think it over.

599
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,920
Let me think again.

600
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,120
Go out first.

601
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,160
Let me think again.

602
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,440
Okay.

603
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,360
Did you follow my medical advice?

604
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,480
What does shaking your head mean?

605
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,520
Today's treatment session
wasn't completed.

606
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,480
Did his blood pressure
suddenly spike to 190?

607
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,440
Yes.

608
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:42,960
But...

609
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:43,960
What?

610
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,560
Spit it out.

611
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:55,040
You said that we shouldn't say
anything without evidence.

612
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:58,320
It's just my speculation now.
So, there is no need to say it.

613
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,240
I told you before,

614
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,280
what is the eye of TCM practitioners?

615
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,440
Yin and Yang.

616
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:10,120
The most important thing for
a TCM practitioner is intuition.

617
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,320
What is intuition?

618
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,320
It's the information given to you
by a higher-dimensional space.

619
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,477
Whatever you feel, just tell me.

620
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,480
As for the results,

621
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,400
we can discuss them
to determine if they are accurate.

622
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,397
I think it has nothing to do
with the acupuncture,

623
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,480
but rather with a person.

624
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,200
Either Senior Uncle

625
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:33,960
has something

626
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,560
to tell Zhao Li Quan,

627
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,000
or Zhao Li Quan

628
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,480
has something to do

629
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,600
with his accident.

630
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,680
But these are all just speculations

631
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,280
without any basis.

632
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,917
So, when Zhao Li Quan
gets close to Senior Uncle,

633
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,280
his blood pressure goes up.

634
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:08,437
You are saying that
his blood pressure spikes

635
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,760
whenever Zhao Li Quan gets close to him?

636
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,080
Yes.

637
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,280
Okay, starting tomorrow,

638
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,560
reduce the visitations.

639
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,360
No one is allowed to go in.

640
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,640
You will be the only one
standing guard there.

641
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,360
I have already told the nurses

642
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,520
not to allow Zhao Li Quan
enter the ward alone.

643
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,560
Would the nurses listen to you?

644
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,040
Just leave them to me.

645
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:36,957
Dad,

646
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,317
I'm visiting Senior Uncle tomorrow.

647
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,157
Grandpa asked me
to bring him something.

648
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,520
Don't go tomorrow.

649
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,000
If you go,

650
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,437
and Li Quan is not allowed to go,
it will upset him.

651
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,520
Something like this bothers him a lot.

652
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,120
Give the stuff to Tou Tou.

653
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,440
She will bring it to him.

654
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,440
Dad,

655
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,520
you are closer to Tou Tou
than your own son.

656
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,400
You let her go, but not me.

657
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,400
You don't trust me.

658
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,680
It's because you're his son,

659
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,440
while Tou Tou is his senior aunt.

660
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:07,280
It's only natural to entrust
such an important task to an elder.

661
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,400
Just leave it to your elder.

662
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,280
Tou Tou said that to you?

663
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,600
But you can't just believe
her side of the story, right?

664
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,477
What if she has a problem
with Zhao Li Quan?

665
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,360
She won't.

666
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,640
Tou Tou isn't that petty.

667
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,360
But then again,

668
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:54,920
you are handling
this matter inappropriately.

669
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:59,120
If someone must administer acupuncture
to Shan Dao in the ICU,

670
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,560
it should be Li Quan, not Tou Tou.

671
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,040
I trust Tou Tou,

672
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,200
I don't trust

673
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,280
other people.

674
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,720
Okay then.

675
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,160
I will go.

676
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,440
I will replace Tou Tou, is that okay?

677
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:14,840
No.

678
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,640
You don't trust me either?

679
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,840
It's not that I don't trust you.

680
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,357
Tou Tou is quick-witted and knows
how to handle different situations.

681
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,440
The most important thing
is that she trusts me.

682
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,800
That's crucial.

683
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,480
If you go there,

684
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,160
being a university professor

685
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,117
and the fourteenth-generation successor,

686
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,440
if you don't listen to me,

687
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,880
I won't dare to divorce you, right?

688
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,520
Don't go.

689
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,440
You're awake.

690
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,280
You scared me.

691
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,560
How did I fall asleep?

692
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,560
Tou Tou,

693
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,480
you've worked hard.

694
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,440
How did you know my legs are sore?

695
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,040
You know,

696
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,720
after standing all day long,

697
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,877
my legs really are sore.

698
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,797
I've been trying to please
the nurses in the ICU.

699
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,800
Otherwise, they won't let me in.

700
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:51,957
I've spent

701
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,280
my entire month's salary
on buying snacks for them,

702
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,840
not a penny left.

703
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,360
I saw everything.

704
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:58,797
You mopped the floor

705
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,117
and cleaned the toilet.

706
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,117
That's because the caregivers
were not around.

707
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,720
Plus, they were already busy.

708
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,440
I just wanted to help them out,

709
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,000
treating them like Tian Xing Xing
and taking care of them.

710
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,200
Then, I'll take care of you too.

711
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:13,560
Today, I'll be your exclusive
service provider.

712
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,877
Just enjoy all the services

713
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,360
I provide for you.

714
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,600
What do you say?

715
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,520
I will

716
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,760
enjoy it then.

717
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,320
How many days have you
not washed your feet?

718
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,480
Three days.

719
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,400
And it's already so smelly.

720
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:52,960
Smell it yourself.

721
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,200
It's not smelly!

722
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,360
Not at...

723
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,397
What are you doing, Ren Tian Zhen?

724
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,520
You're smothering me.

725
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,160
You just touched my feet with your hand.

726
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,040
Ren Tian Zhen, this is so unhygienic.

727
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,197
You're touching my hand with
the hand you used to touch my feet.

728
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,080
You...

729
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,560
What's wrong with you?

730
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,760
We are sharing joys and sorrows.

731
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,480
Disgusting.

732
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,720
You are so disgusting.

733
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,440
All right. I'm going to
get some water to wash your feet.

734
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,437
It's not smelly.

735
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,520
Why do you need water?

736
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,557
It is a little smelly
after I took it off.

737
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,440
Yes.

738
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,200
Guys, come get your cotton pants.

739
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,797
This is such a thick one.
Whose is this?

740
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,077
-I don't know.
-It's mine.

741
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,357
-Mine is grey.
-Here.

742
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,520
I ordered a thicker one.

743
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,397
It has a pound of cotton.
Let me check if it's the right one.

744
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,640
That's right. This is mine.

745
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,557
No one wears cotton pants like that.

746
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,597
It's like going out
with your cotton-filled blanket.

747
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,301
You don't understand.
I'm preparing for pregnancy.

748
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,876
Increased basal body temperature

749
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,520
increases the chances of conception.

750
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,520
Xiao Hong,

751
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,317
you don't even have a boyfriend.

752
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,320
Why are you preparing
for pregnancy every day?

753
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,357
Mrs Ren said that preparing for
pregnancy requires constant readiness,

754
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,077
even if you don't have a boyfriend.

755
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,200
I'm going to try this.

756
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,560
Xiao Hong,

757
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,277
you're becoming

758
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,000
more down-to-earth these days.

759
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,967
Do I look like Xiao Fang
from the village?

760
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:49,637
Yes.

761
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,640
If you tie your hair in braids,
you'll look even more like her.

762
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:54,960
So pretty.

763
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,760
There are no more
appointments available...

764
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,117
for Five Elements Acupuncture today.

765
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,120
Those with mental disorders can
come back tomorrow to register.

766
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,997
Rebecca, why do you always

767
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,197
pull a long face when you see me,
as if I was an enemy?

768
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,400
By the way, your dance just now

769
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,560
was really good.

770
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:13,280
I brought you some food.

771
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,997
I remember you wanted
to maintain your figure,

772
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,280
so I specifically picked
sugar-free yogurt for you.

773
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,640
Come on.

774
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,120
Give me a smile.

775
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:21,640
Scram.

776
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,080
Xiao Hong,

777
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,760
Peng didn't do anything to you.

778
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,480
Why do you two always end up
fighting whenever you meet?

779
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,200
If you have so much time to spare,

780
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,040
go help out at the pharmacy.

781
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,717
Also, you've been running back
and forth here for the past few days.

782
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,640
The hospital is probably
about to fire you.

783
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,200
Then, you can take me in
and provide for me.

784
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,000
Why are you here again?

785
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,597
Lately, you've been coming here

786
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,880
more often than when you pretended
to attend classes.

787
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,880
What's going on with you?
Did you get laid off?

788
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,200
Lay-off your foot!

789
00:40:53,306 --> 00:40:54,326
Xiao Hong...

790
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,637
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

791
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,117
(are referenced from relevant
traditional Chinese medicine books)

792
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,360
(Do not use without medical advice)
