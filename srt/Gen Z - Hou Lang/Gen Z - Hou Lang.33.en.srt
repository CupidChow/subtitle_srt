00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,920
(Gen Z)

2
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,734
(Episode 32)

3
00:01:42,943 --> 00:01:44,222
Tou Tou

4
00:01:44,823 --> 00:01:46,342
has been with us for quite some time,

5
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,319
and we have never
celebrated her birthday.

6
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,440
We should at least
celebrate it once.

7
00:01:50,703 --> 00:01:52,783
We need to have a sense of ceremony.

8
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,942
At the very least, we should know
who we are, where we come from,

9
00:01:56,022 --> 00:01:57,383
and where we are going, right?

10
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,239
I don't need to know

11
00:01:59,303 --> 00:02:00,623
where I came from anymore

12
00:02:00,822 --> 00:02:02,399
because I really don't know

13
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,960
when I was born.

14
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,080
But I know

15
00:02:07,023 --> 00:02:08,279
very clearly

16
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,400
where I'm going.

17
00:02:09,983 --> 00:02:10,983
Where are you going?

18
00:02:12,943 --> 00:02:14,343
I want to work hard to become

19
00:02:15,623 --> 00:02:16,423
the successor.

20
00:02:16,623 --> 00:02:19,983
It's not as easy as you make it sound.

21
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:22,649
Is it that easy to be a successor?

22
00:02:23,102 --> 00:02:25,502
Do you know how many people
are eyeing covetously

23
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,401
this position of successor?

24
00:02:28,303 --> 00:02:31,743
Mr Wu is talented
and a great asset to the country.

25
00:02:31,916 --> 00:02:33,316
Isn't he more suitable

26
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,639
for the position of successor than you?

27
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,329
Master, now you're just teasing me.

28
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,840
No matter how hard I try,

29
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,520
my aptitude is just average.

30
00:02:41,663 --> 00:02:43,422
Unlike you, who are
from a prestigious lineage.

31
00:02:43,502 --> 00:02:45,703
You see, I've been working hard
for half my life.

32
00:02:45,822 --> 00:02:46,902
But when I look up,

33
00:02:47,462 --> 00:02:49,943
I see Tou Tou standing on my shoulders.

34
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,222
Senior Uncle, after hearing
what you said,

35
00:02:52,303 --> 00:02:54,063
I feel like you really are
a bit covetous.

36
00:02:55,449 --> 00:02:58,010
Tou Tou, you said that
your ultimate goal

37
00:02:58,103 --> 00:02:59,782
is to become the successor,

38
00:03:00,262 --> 00:03:01,703
but you need to understand

39
00:03:01,862 --> 00:03:04,462
why you are the chosen one.

40
00:03:05,423 --> 00:03:07,663
It's because of the accumulated merits

41
00:03:07,743 --> 00:03:09,382
from your grandmother

42
00:03:09,462 --> 00:03:12,943
and great-grandmother over the years.

43
00:03:14,063 --> 00:03:17,983
Even though you don't know
the exact day of your birth

44
00:03:18,063 --> 00:03:20,502
or where you came from,

45
00:03:20,582 --> 00:03:21,743
it doesn't matter.

46
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,519
With your bloodline

47
00:03:24,582 --> 00:03:25,582
with all of us here,

48
00:03:26,582 --> 00:03:27,615
when our destinies align,

49
00:03:28,502 --> 00:03:29,802
everything falls into place.

50
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,000
That's right. Let's light the candle.

51
00:03:39,262 --> 00:03:41,315
This is the first time
I'm celebrating my birthday.

52
00:03:43,383 --> 00:03:44,263
I'm a little nervous.

53
00:03:45,743 --> 00:03:46,543
Don't be.

54
00:03:47,622 --> 00:03:50,142
What day is today?
I want to remember it.

55
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,261
You don't need to remember it.
We'll remember it for you.

56
00:03:52,342 --> 00:03:53,142
In the future,

57
00:03:53,222 --> 00:03:55,422
you will have a husband and children.

58
00:03:55,622 --> 00:03:56,902
They will gradually make up

59
00:03:56,982 --> 00:03:58,103
for your past regrets.

60
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:00,210
You have a long life ahead of you.

61
00:04:01,557 --> 00:04:02,596
Come on, make a wish.

62
00:04:04,823 --> 00:04:05,623
Hurry.

63
00:04:14,183 --> 00:04:14,983
Done.

64
00:04:15,543 --> 00:04:16,343
So fast.

65
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:18,322
What did you wish for?

66
00:04:19,383 --> 00:04:20,383
Become the successor.

67
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,240
That's all you wished for?

68
00:04:23,303 --> 00:04:24,423
Aren't you going to wish for

69
00:04:24,463 --> 00:04:26,383
a lifelong partner
who will never leave you?

70
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:27,968
Life is not

71
00:04:28,183 --> 00:04:29,582
just about being a successor.

72
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:34,023
I already made that wish.

73
00:04:36,023 --> 00:04:36,823
Okay then.

74
00:04:37,023 --> 00:04:37,862
Blow the candle.

75
00:04:40,736 --> 00:04:41,769
Let's blow it together.

76
00:04:42,062 --> 00:04:43,183
You blow it.

77
00:04:55,303 --> 00:04:57,183
How could they sue us first?

78
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,440
The first car owner claimed that

79
00:04:59,522 --> 00:05:01,761
we built the fish pond at a junction

80
00:05:01,849 --> 00:05:03,368
without any road signs.

81
00:05:04,396 --> 00:05:05,981
It poses a safety hazard.

82
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,360
He said the blame is on us.

83
00:05:08,557 --> 00:05:10,150
The third driver said the same thing.

84
00:05:10,674 --> 00:05:13,823
He said we shouldn't have dug
the fish pond at that junction

85
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,320
without any protective barriers.

86
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,480
It's not visible at night,

87
00:05:16,696 --> 00:05:18,815
and he fell into it by accident.

88
00:05:19,216 --> 00:05:21,876
He argued that it was unreasonable
to build the fish pond there.

89
00:05:23,383 --> 00:05:24,663
What about the second driver?

90
00:05:25,222 --> 00:05:26,663
He drove into it in broad daylight.

91
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,889
Are we to blame for that too?

92
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,569
The second driver is even worse.

93
00:05:29,743 --> 00:05:31,183
His insurance company

94
00:05:31,383 --> 00:05:32,342
is accusing me

95
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,083
of colluding with him to defraud them.

96
00:05:36,397 --> 00:05:37,317
It's infuriating!

97
00:05:38,023 --> 00:05:39,142
They are just bullying us.

98
00:05:39,222 --> 00:05:40,583
This is nonsense.

99
00:05:40,663 --> 00:05:41,463
Yes, they are.

100
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,081
We would only earn meagre revenue
in the next few years.

101
00:05:45,176 --> 00:05:47,479
Why would we risk it
to defraud the insurance company?

102
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:51,637
What did the court say?

103
00:05:52,822 --> 00:05:53,783
The judge said

104
00:05:54,742 --> 00:05:55,663
that

105
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,590
the responsibility for this accident
needs to be assessed.

106
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,156
Now things have become complicated.

107
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,440
Those in charge of fisheries,

108
00:06:01,462 --> 00:06:02,782
environmental protection,
they all got involved.

109
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,530
They told us a lot of things.

110
00:06:04,743 --> 00:06:05,943
We didn't understand at all.

111
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,440
We asked your brother to explain it,

112
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,754
but even he couldn't understand it.

113
00:06:09,835 --> 00:06:12,354
We've done a lot of things

114
00:06:12,543 --> 00:06:13,663
and spent a lot of money,

115
00:06:14,443 --> 00:06:15,796
but they keep telling us to wait.

116
00:06:16,983 --> 00:06:17,783
Right.

117
00:06:18,703 --> 00:06:21,183
They can wait,
but how can we afford to wait?

118
00:06:21,263 --> 00:06:22,063
Mum.

119
00:06:22,543 --> 00:06:24,463
What can we rely on
to make a living this year?

120
00:06:24,543 --> 00:06:25,903
-Don't be like this.
-Also,

121
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,526
your brother will be
entering high school next year.

122
00:06:28,835 --> 00:06:29,995
Don't cry, Mum.

123
00:06:31,543 --> 00:06:33,016
Dad, what did the village chief say?

124
00:06:33,849 --> 00:06:35,048
The village chief blamed us.

125
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,359
He said this village has feng shui.

126
00:06:37,943 --> 00:06:39,622
We disrupted the water.

127
00:06:39,703 --> 00:06:41,823
The village will face problems
in the future.

128
00:06:42,383 --> 00:06:43,543
He's talking nonsense!

129
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,590
They have been enjoying the ducks
we gave him for free for so many years.

130
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,080
How can he be so ungrateful?

131
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,169
When trouble comes, he chickens out.

132
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,439
This is your fault.

133
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,503
If you had married his niece,
he would have helped us.

134
00:06:58,583 --> 00:06:59,783
Enough! Don't even bring that up!

135
00:06:59,863 --> 00:07:01,109
How can you blame that on me?

136
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,553
This is what I will do.

137
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,103
I have a friend who studies law.
She's pretty good.

138
00:07:13,863 --> 00:07:15,103
I will consult her.

139
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:17,823
You guys will spend the night here.

140
00:07:18,103 --> 00:07:19,663
We will talk tomorrow, okay?

141
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,068
The place is a little small.
I'll sleep on the floor.

142
00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:25,989
It's convenient.

143
00:07:55,543 --> 00:07:56,343
Grandpa.

144
00:07:59,263 --> 00:08:01,502
Thank you for

145
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,970
throwing me a birthday party.

146
00:08:04,783 --> 00:08:07,103
I'm really flattered.

147
00:08:07,263 --> 00:08:09,062
It's such a big piece of cake, right?

148
00:08:10,983 --> 00:08:12,022
Sun Tou Tou,

149
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,119
I've arranged for
such a big event for you.

150
00:08:17,343 --> 00:08:19,063
Is this how you repay me?

151
00:08:20,502 --> 00:08:22,022
You are so unkind.

152
00:08:23,143 --> 00:08:24,103
I mean, Grandpa,

153
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,560
it's because of your health.

154
00:08:28,103 --> 00:08:30,183
You can't have too many cakes.

155
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:31,783
If you could, I would have

156
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,320
let you eat it.

157
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:56,302
Happy now?

158
00:08:57,143 --> 00:08:59,062
I'm being kind to you now, right?

159
00:09:00,143 --> 00:09:01,662
That's more like it.

160
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:03,863
Eat it now. Don't let Grandma see it.

161
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:06,556
If she catches you,
she's going to scold me too.

162
00:09:08,383 --> 00:09:09,183
Hide it from here.

163
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,263
I'm good to you, huh?

164
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,400
Is it good?

165
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,320
I'm good to you, right, Grandpa?

166
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,400
Stop.

167
00:09:27,222 --> 00:09:28,022
Grandpa.

168
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:30,183
Grandpa, here.

169
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,680
Yes, yes.

170
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,840
You are the best.

171
00:09:39,182 --> 00:09:40,023
Of course, Grandpa.

172
00:09:40,103 --> 00:09:42,702
Our cooperation today was seamless.

173
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,761
It was excellent.

174
00:09:49,502 --> 00:09:51,222
That's enough. Don't eat too much.

175
00:09:51,342 --> 00:09:52,142
No more.

176
00:09:52,222 --> 00:09:53,022
No more.

177
00:09:53,742 --> 00:09:55,663
Keep your voice down.

178
00:10:04,255 --> 00:10:05,056
Honey,

179
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,521
you're very likely

180
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,070
about to have a daughter-in-law.

181
00:10:13,595 --> 00:10:14,395
Wait.

182
00:10:14,582 --> 00:10:15,382
What?

183
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:18,502
But Meng Meng just died.

184
00:10:19,436 --> 00:10:21,556
Didn't you notice it?

185
00:10:22,843 --> 00:10:25,762
Tian Zhen and Tou Tou
are seeing each other.

186
00:10:27,283 --> 00:10:28,083
It's...

187
00:10:29,042 --> 00:10:29,842
It's impossible.

188
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,109
Not long ago,

189
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,919
Tian Zhen told me that
he has feelings for someone,

190
00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:37,249
but he hasn't confessed yet.

191
00:10:38,357 --> 00:10:39,997
This someone he said,

192
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:41,609
why can't it be Tou Tou?

193
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,160
That's impossible.

194
00:10:44,049 --> 00:10:46,808
Tou Tou isn't like a girl at all.

195
00:10:47,363 --> 00:10:49,202
Different people
have different preferences.

196
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,523
Besides, it's not like
you're the one marrying her.

197
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:57,456
How could you tell?

198
00:10:57,583 --> 00:10:58,782
Their eyes.

199
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,942
Didn't you see the way

200
00:11:01,343 --> 00:11:03,703
Tian Zhen looked at Tou Tou
when he said...

201
00:11:03,836 --> 00:11:06,022
A lifelong partner
who will never leave you.

202
00:11:06,323 --> 00:11:07,383
Life is not

203
00:11:07,643 --> 00:11:09,042
just about being a successor.

204
00:11:11,782 --> 00:11:13,222
The way he was looking at her.

205
00:11:16,397 --> 00:11:17,596
The weird thing is,

206
00:11:17,963 --> 00:11:21,183
normally, when Tou Tou heard such words,

207
00:11:21,403 --> 00:11:23,502
she would have already exclaimed

208
00:11:23,742 --> 00:11:25,303
that she won't get married.

209
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:27,310
But today,

210
00:11:28,863 --> 00:11:30,262
she didn't say anything.

211
00:11:33,356 --> 00:11:34,982
You women always

212
00:11:35,102 --> 00:11:36,862
overthink things.

213
00:11:38,223 --> 00:11:40,343
Just keep my words in mind.

214
00:11:41,502 --> 00:11:42,303
What do you think?

215
00:11:45,129 --> 00:11:45,929
If Tou Tou

216
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,760
gets together with Tian Zhen,

217
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,961
do you think

218
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:52,176
she's not good enough for Tian Zhen?

219
00:11:57,188 --> 00:11:58,948
They're a perfect match.

220
00:11:59,662 --> 00:12:01,662
Tian Zhen needs someone like Tou Tou.

221
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,760
Tou Tou is a decisive girl.

222
00:12:05,129 --> 00:12:06,449
Tian Zhen grew up in

223
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,721
a protective environment.

224
00:12:09,242 --> 00:12:10,323
Ling Lan, as his mother,

225
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,950
has a strong personality.

226
00:12:12,463 --> 00:12:15,263
Tian Zhen has always lacked
assertiveness since childhood.

227
00:12:16,056 --> 00:12:17,977
If he's with Tou Tou,

228
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:20,581
they will complement
each other perfectly.

229
00:12:20,789 --> 00:12:21,749
Moreover,

230
00:12:22,183 --> 00:12:24,023
Tou Tou entered society earlier

231
00:12:24,302 --> 00:12:25,982
and has more experience.

232
00:12:26,242 --> 00:12:28,997
She has a broader perspective
when dealing with things.

233
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,296
If they really become a couple,

234
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,079
it will be a blessing for our family.

235
00:12:35,662 --> 00:12:37,503
You're one of a kind.

236
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:40,023
You think other people are
better than your own grandson.

237
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,560
In my eyes,

238
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,382
my grandson is perfect in every way.

239
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:45,022
Tou Tou, as the successor,

240
00:12:45,102 --> 00:12:46,783
is barely a good match to my grandson.

241
00:12:48,982 --> 00:12:49,823
Listen,

242
00:12:50,715 --> 00:12:51,996
pretend you don't know.

243
00:12:52,502 --> 00:12:53,302
Got it?

244
00:12:54,302 --> 00:12:55,102
Why?

245
00:12:57,249 --> 00:13:00,049
Don't you want a great-grandson sooner?

246
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,160
Got it?

247
00:13:02,303 --> 00:13:03,262
Got it.

248
00:13:03,343 --> 00:13:04,903
No matter who asks,

249
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:06,730
I will say I don't know.

250
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,120
There you go.

251
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:20,303
(As the Cold Dew season begins,
cold air moves southward.)

252
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,560
(There is a significant temperature
difference between day and night.)

253
00:13:24,412 --> 00:13:26,160
(Autumn dryness becomes evident.)

254
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,894
(There is more dew.
The days carry a sense of chill.)

255
00:13:30,155 --> 00:13:34,200
(Hence the name "Cold Dew".)

256
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:41,919
(Cold Dew)

257
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:55,575
Morning, Grandpa.

258
00:13:58,309 --> 00:13:59,590
Any news today?

259
00:14:00,801 --> 00:14:01,602
Yes.

260
00:14:04,996 --> 00:14:05,796
Hang on.

261
00:14:06,782 --> 00:14:08,542
What did you see that amused you?

262
00:14:08,836 --> 00:14:10,036
You.

263
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,121
What's so amusing about me?

264
00:14:13,628 --> 00:14:14,428
You...

265
00:14:15,783 --> 00:14:17,943
I can't tell you I know.

266
00:14:19,223 --> 00:14:20,023
Hang on.

267
00:14:21,223 --> 00:14:22,662
Tell me what you know.

268
00:14:24,343 --> 00:14:26,102
I... I don't know anything.

269
00:14:32,343 --> 00:14:34,343
I envy you.

270
00:14:35,023 --> 00:14:36,263
It's so nice to be young.

271
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,640
What did you see that made you so happy?

272
00:14:39,662 --> 00:14:41,383
I don't know. Stop asking.

273
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:43,022
I... I don't know.

274
00:14:43,222 --> 00:14:44,022
Fine, fine.

275
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,281
You keep that up.

276
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,240
Mum, can you help me take a
day off from the medical centre?

277
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:50,799
I'm going to the apprentice class today.
Li Quan wants to see me.

278
00:14:52,483 --> 00:14:53,923
Is Tou Tou awake yet?

279
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,803
She's in the study with your dad.

280
00:14:56,883 --> 00:14:58,763
She's having a lesson
so early in the morning?

281
00:15:01,023 --> 00:15:02,676
I will skip breakfast.
I have to go now.

282
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,160
Grandpa,

283
00:15:08,815 --> 00:15:10,255
you keep having fun here.

284
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,440
Thank you, Dr Sun.

285
00:15:29,516 --> 00:15:30,943
Your words today have enlightened me

286
00:15:31,023 --> 00:15:32,022
and made me contemplate for a long time.

287
00:15:32,236 --> 00:15:34,903
But you asked me to transfer
the money back and give it up

288
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,733
just to have a clear conscience.

289
00:15:37,817 --> 00:15:38,617
I can't do it.

290
00:15:40,617 --> 00:15:41,857
You are losing sleep

291
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,920
just because of this?

292
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,599
Everyone has their own destiny.

293
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,702
He has already made his choice.
Let him be.

294
00:15:57,822 --> 00:15:59,743
I just feel bad.

295
00:16:00,383 --> 00:16:01,623
Why are you feeling bad?

296
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,341
Did I say something wrong?

297
00:16:04,508 --> 00:16:05,429
No, you didn't.

298
00:16:05,556 --> 00:16:07,262
Yes, but the same reasoning,

299
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,080
when you told it to Cheng Ying, Zhu Xia,

300
00:16:10,316 --> 00:16:11,595
and Madam Jiang,

301
00:16:11,897 --> 00:16:13,696
they all accepted it
and changed themselves.

302
00:16:14,249 --> 00:16:15,410
I told Daring Lu

303
00:16:15,716 --> 00:16:17,235
the same reasoning,

304
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:21,149
yet he just won't listen.

305
00:16:22,662 --> 00:16:23,583
What does this tell us?

306
00:16:25,096 --> 00:16:27,122
It tells us that the reasoning
works with you

307
00:16:27,343 --> 00:16:28,583
but not with me.

308
00:16:30,183 --> 00:16:32,063
Zhu Chang Ming

309
00:16:33,897 --> 00:16:34,897
didn't listen to me too.

310
00:16:37,655 --> 00:16:39,655
Everyone speaks of reason in the world.

311
00:16:39,988 --> 00:16:41,589
If everyone is reasonable,

312
00:16:42,395 --> 00:16:43,795
then there will only be Yang

313
00:16:43,876 --> 00:16:44,715
and no Yin.

314
00:16:45,349 --> 00:16:46,929
There will be no human world anymore.

315
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,599
I still believe that your power
for goodness is greater than mine.

316
00:16:58,636 --> 00:16:59,555
That's why

317
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,681
I can't convince him.

318
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:04,802
You are still so young.

319
00:17:05,502 --> 00:17:07,502
Just think about how old I am.

320
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,040
You didn't see the times
when I suffered losses

321
00:17:11,303 --> 00:17:12,903
and backed down.

322
00:17:14,248 --> 00:17:15,168
Really.

323
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,239
I have been through
countless trials and hardships,

324
00:17:19,461 --> 00:17:22,781
and have just started
to see a glimmer of success.

325
00:17:22,942 --> 00:17:23,942
If at your age,

326
00:17:25,182 --> 00:17:27,583
you could succeed in everything you do,
create miracles,

327
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:29,703
then I wouldn't have been your master,

328
00:17:29,783 --> 00:17:31,383
you would have been mine.

329
00:17:35,023 --> 00:17:36,182
So, Tou Tou,

330
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:38,623
you must always

331
00:17:38,902 --> 00:17:40,142
do the right thing.

332
00:17:40,323 --> 00:17:42,756
Don't be too attached to material gains,
don't pity yourself.

333
00:17:42,982 --> 00:17:45,023
And you will become what I am today.

334
00:17:48,976 --> 00:17:49,776
But Master,

335
00:17:50,296 --> 00:17:52,856
Daring Lu just got away like this

336
00:17:52,956 --> 00:17:53,915
and escaped justice.

337
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:59,080
There was another person
similar to Daring Lu.

338
00:17:59,268 --> 00:18:00,508
You can find information
about him online.

339
00:18:00,589 --> 00:18:01,988
His name is Lai Chang Xing.

340
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,893
He was on the run overseas
for many years,

341
00:18:05,976 --> 00:18:07,543
but eventually, he was apprehended.

342
00:18:08,408 --> 00:18:10,049
So, you should have faith in justice

343
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,280
and in God.

344
00:18:15,662 --> 00:18:17,023
If that's the case,

345
00:18:17,635 --> 00:18:20,916
there will be no bad people
who can escape the law in this world.

346
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,880
In China, freedom...

347
00:18:26,974 --> 00:18:27,895
What is freedom?

348
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,481
Freedom is not
the ultimate state of carefreeness,

349
00:18:32,782 --> 00:18:33,982
it is being at ease.

350
00:18:35,602 --> 00:18:36,888
What does it mean to be at ease?

351
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,081
Confucius has explained it very clearly.

352
00:18:40,863 --> 00:18:44,062
Do as you desire, but stay within
the bounds of propriety.

353
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,560
Propriety is the object.

354
00:18:49,062 --> 00:18:51,262
Imagine someone
hiding overseas for 20 years.

355
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,880
Will they be at ease in their heart?

356
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:55,470
Impossible.

357
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:57,383
20 years.

358
00:18:57,943 --> 00:19:00,422
20 years of hiding,
sleeping with one eye open.

359
00:19:00,655 --> 00:19:03,001
It would be better to be
imprisoned or sentenced to death.

360
00:19:05,782 --> 00:19:07,223
Now, let's imagine there's a person

361
00:19:07,823 --> 00:19:09,663
who has a family, children,

362
00:19:09,743 --> 00:19:11,383
and a very successful career
that keeps growing.

363
00:19:11,463 --> 00:19:12,743
The higher he climbs,

364
00:19:12,823 --> 00:19:14,782
the more fearful he becomes.

365
00:19:15,343 --> 00:19:17,542
How can he truly be at ease?

366
00:19:23,902 --> 00:19:25,583
Daring Lu

367
00:19:26,943 --> 00:19:29,743
is used to living a lavish lifestyle.

368
00:19:30,743 --> 00:19:32,782
He won't be able
to stay in a small place

369
00:19:35,022 --> 00:19:36,062
like Palau for long.

370
00:19:36,623 --> 00:19:38,623
Then, he will turn himself in.

371
00:19:43,149 --> 00:19:43,949
Right?

372
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:45,936
Right.

373
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,389
So, that's basically what happened.

374
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,189
Rebecca, is there anything you can do?

375
00:20:00,929 --> 00:20:01,729
Nothing.

376
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,120
Looks like you're not
as capable as the rumours suggest.

377
00:20:05,196 --> 00:20:06,703
They say you win every lawsuit.

378
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Why is it that every time we came to you
with a problem, you have no solution?

379
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,280
I win every lawsuit

380
00:20:10,343 --> 00:20:12,662
because I only take cases
that I can win.

381
00:20:13,036 --> 00:20:14,263
And I can't win this case.

382
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,662
Moreover, Li Quan's family
needs to win this case immediately.

383
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,879
Even God can't help you
to win it right away.

384
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,320
If the lawsuit drags on
for eight or ten years,

385
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,633
they won't be able to use the fish pond.

386
00:20:22,714 --> 00:20:24,154
Yet they still have to pay the rent.

387
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:25,369
They will be doomed.

388
00:20:25,456 --> 00:20:26,456
That's why I suspect...

389
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,200
-Suspect what?
-Suspect what?

390
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:31,462
I suspect someone wants

391
00:20:31,542 --> 00:20:32,703
your family's fish pond.

392
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,560
Strange things don't happen
without reason.

393
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:40,049
Your family has been leasing
the fish pond for 20 years.

394
00:20:40,662 --> 00:20:42,383
Nothing happened over the past years,

395
00:20:42,463 --> 00:20:44,462
but suddenly, within two months,

396
00:20:44,542 --> 00:20:45,823
three cars fell into it.

397
00:20:46,517 --> 00:20:47,797
Is that just a coincidence?

398
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:50,690
So, you have two options now.

399
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:51,920
First option,

400
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:54,143
you can hire a better lawyer
to investigate

401
00:20:54,343 --> 00:20:56,903
and uncover the connection
behind these three drivers,

402
00:20:56,983 --> 00:20:57,903
and prove that

403
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,040
they targeted your family's fish pond.

404
00:21:00,203 --> 00:21:02,382
But this will cost a lot of money,

405
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,502
and you won't be able
to recover that expense.

406
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:06,969
You will be paying a lot
just to prove that you are right.

407
00:21:08,189 --> 00:21:11,102
Of course, there's another possibility.
I might misjudge it.

408
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,641
It might just be a coincidence.

409
00:21:12,703 --> 00:21:14,823
In that case, your money
would be completely wasted.

410
00:21:15,863 --> 00:21:17,142
Tell me the second option.

411
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,119
Admit defeat.

412
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,375
Return the fish pond to the village.

413
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,314
Tell the village chief that
you're returning the fish pond.

414
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,800
That you don't want
this business anymore.

415
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,960
The village chief

416
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,120
will probably help you
resolve the situation quickly.

417
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,479
But both options would result in
our family losing money.

418
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,740
Well, it's because your family
has been targeted by thieves.

419
00:21:33,468 --> 00:21:35,222
No one wanted that piece
of swampy land in the beginning.

420
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,880
Li Quan's father got sick
from digging the land.

421
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,080
It was just cleaned up
not even two years ago.

422
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,400
Why should they give it away?

423
00:21:39,482 --> 00:21:40,282
Why?

424
00:21:40,782 --> 00:21:43,102
Because they are sure that
your family has no money.

425
00:21:43,182 --> 00:21:44,943
And that you can only give it up.

426
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,800
What if I have money?

427
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:55,583
I mean, what if.

428
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,640
If I can prove that

429
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:00,503
someone is behind this incident,

430
00:22:00,729 --> 00:22:02,528
can we get them to compensate?

431
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,000
No.

432
00:22:04,422 --> 00:22:05,543
-Why?
-Why?

433
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:09,128
Because for them,

434
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,920
their biggest loss

435
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:13,990
is not being able to claim
the insurance money for their cars.

436
00:22:14,462 --> 00:22:16,182
So, it's impossible for you

437
00:22:16,262 --> 00:22:17,062
to get them

438
00:22:17,142 --> 00:22:18,822
to compensate your family.

439
00:22:18,902 --> 00:22:21,222
So basically, all the financial
and material resources

440
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:22,582
you've spent will be in vain.

441
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,240
This is so unfair.

442
00:22:27,182 --> 00:22:29,583
Where in this world
can you find absolute fairness?

443
00:22:30,703 --> 00:22:31,763
Quan, what do you think?

444
00:22:33,542 --> 00:22:34,902
Tell me. What do you think?

445
00:22:36,623 --> 00:22:37,423
Rebecca,

446
00:22:38,456 --> 00:22:40,177
can you recommend me
a really good lawyer?

447
00:22:41,022 --> 00:22:43,068
Are you sure you want
to pursue this to the end?

448
00:22:43,302 --> 00:22:46,182
Are your parents not going
to live in the village anymore?

449
00:22:47,662 --> 00:22:48,462
We are poor people.

450
00:22:49,182 --> 00:22:50,343
We still have our lives.

451
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:52,822
All right.

452
00:22:52,902 --> 00:22:54,462
Quan, I have around about 30,000 yuan.

453
00:22:54,542 --> 00:22:55,848
I'll transfer it to you later.

454
00:22:56,022 --> 00:22:57,943
That's barely enough.

455
00:23:37,802 --> 00:23:39,003
Are you waiting for someone?

456
00:23:42,196 --> 00:23:43,997
Rebecca told me about your case.

457
00:23:44,563 --> 00:23:45,536
What do you want to do?

458
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,160
What do you mean?

459
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:54,863
Do you want to investigate
those few insurance fraudsters only?

460
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,720
Let things settle down
and each go their own way?

461
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,920
Or do you want to uncover
the entire chain of interests

462
00:23:58,983 --> 00:24:01,283
behind your village chief
to eliminate future troubles?

463
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,400
Sir,

464
00:24:07,422 --> 00:24:08,863
please give me a clear guidance.

465
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,640
This matter involves various interests.

466
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:21,263
The simplest solution will require
at least this amount of payment.

467
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,440
30,000 yuan?

468
00:24:24,823 --> 00:24:25,823
300,000 yuan.

469
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,800
Sir, can you lower the price?

470
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:38,190
300,000 yuan is too expensive for me.

471
00:24:40,643 --> 00:24:41,443
Expensive?

472
00:24:42,943 --> 00:24:43,743
Yes.

473
00:25:01,503 --> 00:25:02,303
We are

474
00:25:02,623 --> 00:25:03,782
a team.

475
00:25:15,823 --> 00:25:17,663
Quality comes with a price.

476
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,399
Zhao, you're finally back.

477
00:25:39,555 --> 00:25:41,555
The manager was just looking for you.
Go now.

478
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:45,342
Be smart. Mr Tu was pulling a long face.

479
00:25:45,422 --> 00:25:46,583
He seemed upset.

480
00:25:47,983 --> 00:25:48,783
Thanks.

481
00:25:54,316 --> 00:25:55,116
Where have you been?

482
00:25:55,769 --> 00:25:56,730
I went to the hospital.

483
00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:58,262
You're lying.

484
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,960
Mr Li just called me.

485
00:26:01,235 --> 00:26:02,235
I asked him about you.

486
00:26:02,676 --> 00:26:04,036
He said he didn't see you at all.

487
00:26:04,823 --> 00:26:05,623
Yes.

488
00:26:07,022 --> 00:26:08,382
I was going to go to see him,

489
00:26:08,542 --> 00:26:09,702
but something came up.

490
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,095
I got distracted and forgot about it.

491
00:26:11,176 --> 00:26:13,369
I came back to get a document.
I will leave right away.

492
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:15,582
Let me ask you,

493
00:26:16,022 --> 00:26:17,623
how did it go with the task

494
00:26:18,015 --> 00:26:19,108
I entrusted you last time?

495
00:26:21,902 --> 00:26:22,702
Zhao Li Quan,

496
00:26:23,189 --> 00:26:24,589
do you still want your job here?

497
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,466
I have no idea what you're busy with
every day at work.

498
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,588
You are late for work,
and you don't socialise with clients.

499
00:26:30,669 --> 00:26:32,468
Are you rich

500
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:34,270
or is your family rich?

501
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,680
Haven't you always boasted about
your good relationship with Mr Wu?

502
00:26:38,762 --> 00:26:40,242
It's just a card.

503
00:26:41,022 --> 00:26:42,635
Is it that difficult to give it to him?

504
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:44,294
I gave him the card.

505
00:26:45,782 --> 00:26:46,582
You did?

506
00:26:48,422 --> 00:26:49,623
Why didn't you say so earlier?

507
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,721
What did Mr Wu say?

508
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,920
He said

509
00:26:55,542 --> 00:26:57,142
he needs some time
to take care of it.

510
00:26:58,102 --> 00:26:59,862
He just called me and told me
to go see him.

511
00:27:01,022 --> 00:27:03,662
This is why I was distracted and
forgot to go to the hospital.

512
00:27:04,302 --> 00:27:05,102
I see.

513
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,960
There is no need
to go to the hospital now.

514
00:27:07,022 --> 00:27:08,062
I'll give Mr Li a call.

515
00:27:08,262 --> 00:27:09,382
Go and see Mr Wu now.

516
00:27:09,889 --> 00:27:12,322
Try to secure the early-year
insurance contract this time.

517
00:27:12,969 --> 00:27:13,969
I can't see him today.

518
00:27:14,902 --> 00:27:15,942
Mr Wu and I

519
00:27:16,022 --> 00:27:17,703
agreed to meet up tomorrow morning.

520
00:27:18,943 --> 00:27:19,743
Okay.

521
00:27:19,969 --> 00:27:20,969
Tomorrow morning then.

522
00:27:21,782 --> 00:27:22,679
Don't let me down.

523
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,799
I'm counting on you.

524
00:27:26,142 --> 00:27:26,942
I should get going.

525
00:27:27,142 --> 00:27:28,262
Okay, go on.

526
00:27:46,583 --> 00:27:47,383
Unbelievable.

527
00:27:47,823 --> 00:27:50,022
Stop circling around.
You're making me dizzy.

528
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:51,919
Just be patient.

529
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,520
Our son will be back soon.

530
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,666
He's been gone for such a long time.
Why hasn't he returned yet?

531
00:27:56,903 --> 00:27:58,103
Well, he's busy, isn't he?

532
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,200
-You're home.
-Dad.

533
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,200
-Quan, you're home.
-Mum.

534
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:09,743
I've reheated the food twice.

535
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,680
It's all your favourite food.

536
00:28:13,496 --> 00:28:14,616
Go get changed for dinner.

537
00:28:27,062 --> 00:28:27,862
Come.

538
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:31,960
Come now.

539
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,881
Mum, thank you for preparing dinner.

540
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,880
Dad, I consulted my friend today.

541
00:28:38,943 --> 00:28:41,062
She suggested that
we settle outside the court.

542
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,120
Don't worry,

543
00:28:42,203 --> 00:28:44,642
she said she would find me
a good lawyer.

544
00:28:46,242 --> 00:28:47,123
That's great.

545
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,280
Does that mean

546
00:28:49,382 --> 00:28:51,461
we will receive compensation soon?

547
00:28:53,223 --> 00:28:54,529
How does the settlement work?

548
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,509
Will we be the ones paying them

549
00:28:56,983 --> 00:28:58,342
or will they pay us?

550
00:29:00,206 --> 00:29:01,006
It's good, Mum.

551
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:02,961
Have some more.

552
00:29:03,243 --> 00:29:04,313
Let's finish dinner first.

553
00:29:04,503 --> 00:29:05,903
Stop eating first, son.

554
00:29:06,776 --> 00:29:08,936
We can't be the one paying them.

555
00:29:10,416 --> 00:29:12,440
Also, we won't be able
to raise fish in our fish pond

556
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,640
for the next three years.

557
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,103
Who will compensate for our loss?

558
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,080
Let's not talk about it now.

559
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,503
Our son has had a long day.
Let's finish dinner first.

560
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,719
Forget about dinner.

561
00:29:20,816 --> 00:29:22,696
How can I eat
without understanding everything?

562
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:27,463
Here. Have some fish.

563
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:49,830
You're home.

564
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:52,840
How did it go?

565
00:29:55,123 --> 00:29:55,963
Are you upset?

566
00:29:57,678 --> 00:29:58,999
You didn't see Little Lark?

567
00:29:59,080 --> 00:29:59,960
No.

568
00:30:00,782 --> 00:30:02,143
-She didn't go?
-She did.

569
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,800
Then, how come you didn't see her?

570
00:30:03,916 --> 00:30:04,955
I saw her.

571
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,800
You said you didn't see her, and then
the next second you said you did.

572
00:30:07,863 --> 00:30:09,342
Did you see her or not?

573
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,239
Are you trying to pick a fight?

574
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:15,870
Why would I want to pick a fight?

575
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,435
Don't I greet you like this every day
when you come back from outside?

576
00:30:19,516 --> 00:30:21,235
Why is it suddenly not allowed today?

577
00:30:21,563 --> 00:30:23,503
You asked me if I saw Little Lark.

578
00:30:23,583 --> 00:30:25,302
I said no, and you...

579
00:30:26,163 --> 00:30:27,503
That means I saw her.

580
00:30:27,583 --> 00:30:29,743
It's the same as the answer
I gave before.

581
00:30:29,983 --> 00:30:31,462
I didn't change it.

582
00:30:31,542 --> 00:30:33,182
-You are...
-Hang on, hang on.

583
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,760
Don't confuse me.

584
00:30:36,017 --> 00:30:37,017
I asked you

585
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:39,150
if you saw Little Lark.

586
00:30:39,382 --> 00:30:40,503
Weren't you supposed to say

587
00:30:40,583 --> 00:30:41,662
you saw her?

588
00:30:42,422 --> 00:30:44,223
Why did you say you didn't see her?

589
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,240
Who is actually in the wrong?

590
00:30:47,423 --> 00:30:49,583
And you came home
with a frown on your face.

591
00:30:49,996 --> 00:30:51,222
What is the meaning of this?

592
00:30:52,022 --> 00:30:52,822
Let's drop it.

593
00:30:53,262 --> 00:30:54,823
Can we not discuss this anymore?

594
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,559
As soon as I asked,
you just want to shut me up.

595
00:31:02,975 --> 00:31:04,095
Did I offend you?

596
00:31:05,069 --> 00:31:06,349
Did I make you angry?

597
00:31:09,302 --> 00:31:10,382
Is it because someone else

598
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:11,902
ignored you?

599
00:31:25,943 --> 00:31:27,143
That's why they say

600
00:31:27,224 --> 00:31:30,624
time is like a butcher's knife.

601
00:31:31,902 --> 00:31:34,743
The dashing young men

602
00:31:36,662 --> 00:31:38,902
all look the same
when they reach their middle age.

603
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,678
Didn't the boys in your class
cry their hearts out?

604
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:43,919
Who do you think you are,

605
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,400
giving me attitude?

606
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:47,235
If you have the guts,

607
00:31:47,741 --> 00:31:49,381
show that attitude to Little Lark.

608
00:31:52,902 --> 00:31:53,702
Why?

609
00:31:54,422 --> 00:31:56,075
Do you think
everyone is crazy about you?

610
00:31:57,623 --> 00:31:59,623
You are the only one
who is crazy about him.

611
00:32:04,302 --> 00:32:05,102
Young Master,

612
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:08,670
want me to arrange a blind date
for you tomorrow?

613
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,801
Too easy.

614
00:32:29,022 --> 00:32:30,262
What are they fighting about?

615
00:32:32,142 --> 00:32:33,262
Xin Zheng

616
00:32:34,182 --> 00:32:35,943
went to see his ex-girlfriend.

617
00:32:38,743 --> 00:32:41,782
At this age,

618
00:32:42,422 --> 00:32:43,982
how could she still be jealous?

619
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:46,062
Xin Zheng isn't that kind of man.

620
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,520
If he had wanted to fool around,

621
00:32:48,829 --> 00:32:49,868
when he was young,

622
00:32:50,743 --> 00:32:51,942
so many patients

623
00:32:52,022 --> 00:32:54,022
were infatuated with him.

624
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,341
That also depends on whether
Xin Zheng is infatuated with anyone.

625
00:32:59,401 --> 00:33:00,401
You women

626
00:33:01,142 --> 00:33:02,902
always have imaginary enemies.

627
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,840
My enemy wasn't imaginary back then.

628
00:33:08,262 --> 00:33:09,382
Don't bring up the past.

629
00:33:09,463 --> 00:33:11,023
Life is only so long,

630
00:33:11,103 --> 00:33:13,382
What matters is
who the ultimate winner is in the end.

631
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,920
I'm all yours now,

632
00:33:16,262 --> 00:33:17,223
aren't I?

633
00:33:18,502 --> 00:33:19,302
Cheesy.

634
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,240
But then again,

635
00:33:22,395 --> 00:33:25,435
it's me who has been taking care
of you when you're sick.

636
00:33:26,602 --> 00:33:28,035
And I'm grateful for it, my wife.

637
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,399
It's hard

638
00:33:32,008 --> 00:33:33,168
to pass the test of love.

639
00:33:33,796 --> 00:33:35,782
Yet everyone has to go through it.

640
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,081
It's hard.

641
00:33:39,322 --> 00:33:40,122
It's your turn.

642
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:57,463
(Little Red Flower Orphanage)
Tou Tou has completely changed.

643
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,240
You won't see any of her

644
00:33:59,336 --> 00:34:01,696
former unruly and
mischievous behaviour now.

645
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:03,903
(One of the reasons
we chose her back then)

646
00:34:03,936 --> 00:34:04,976
(was to see if Xin Zheng)

647
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,515
(could truly uphold the principle
of teaching without discrimination.)

648
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,559
I'll take her to meet you during
the next ancestor worship ceremony.

649
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,801
You will be really surprised.

650
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:12,783
Also,

651
00:34:13,049 --> 00:34:15,168
you can completely
set your mind at ease now.

652
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,479
It was under the fate's guidance

653
00:34:17,541 --> 00:34:20,301
to entrust her to you back then.

654
00:34:20,943 --> 00:34:21,743
(Yes,)

655
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,440
I understand your wish.

656
00:34:23,836 --> 00:34:27,023
Xin Zheng is kind-hearted and generous.

657
00:34:27,336 --> 00:34:30,622
He has imparted
all his knowledge to Tou Tou.

658
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:31,741
And Tou Tou

659
00:34:31,822 --> 00:34:33,383
is fully qualified

660
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,159
to become the successor.

661
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,520
Ren Xin Zheng, his name means
righteousness and ambitious aspirations.

662
00:34:38,601 --> 00:34:40,282
When I saw him, I knew that

663
00:34:40,422 --> 00:34:42,582
under his guidance,

664
00:34:42,721 --> 00:34:44,521
(Tou Tou would definitely
walk the right path.)

665
00:34:44,602 --> 00:34:45,722
You're absolutely right.

666
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,600
There's another matter
I'd like to discuss with you.

667
00:34:48,695 --> 00:34:51,342
It's about the documents
containing Tou Tou's real identity.

668
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:53,623
I don't think there's a need
to keep any copies of it.

669
00:34:54,123 --> 00:34:56,102
I will destroy the copy I have,

670
00:34:56,182 --> 00:34:56,982
is that all right?

671
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,840
(After handing her over to you,)

672
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,200
(everything about her past)

673
00:35:01,262 --> 00:35:03,000
(in my possession no longer exists.)

674
00:35:04,623 --> 00:35:06,702
You really are an enlightened person.

675
00:35:06,782 --> 00:35:08,182
You are much more insightful than me.

676
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,880
At that time, I was concerned
that she could be a lost cause,

677
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,423
so I saw these documents

678
00:35:13,503 --> 00:35:15,142
as my fallback plan.

679
00:35:16,262 --> 00:35:17,342
Looking back,

680
00:35:17,422 --> 00:35:19,382
I realise my level of enlightenment
was low.

681
00:35:19,902 --> 00:35:22,182
Regardless of who her parents are,

682
00:35:22,262 --> 00:35:25,480
I believe that she is fully qualified
to take on this role.

683
00:35:26,022 --> 00:35:30,103
She is the rightful successor of
the Jiang family's acupuncture sect.

684
00:35:30,496 --> 00:35:31,336
Tou Tou.

685
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,480
Okay.

686
00:35:40,422 --> 00:35:41,222
My parents

687
00:35:41,302 --> 00:35:43,822
are coming to celebrate
the Dragon Boat Festival with me.

688
00:35:44,543 --> 00:35:46,743
I told them before that I found a job.

689
00:35:48,303 --> 00:35:50,022
When you see them,

690
00:35:50,102 --> 00:35:51,623
can you tell them that

691
00:35:51,703 --> 00:35:53,063
I'm working at the medical centre?

692
00:35:54,102 --> 00:35:55,582
And that it's a permanent position?

693
00:35:57,503 --> 00:35:59,102
Are you asking me to lie?

694
00:36:00,342 --> 00:36:01,262
Let me tell you,

695
00:36:01,342 --> 00:36:02,782
I never lie.

696
00:36:02,862 --> 00:36:04,862
And I won't lie for you.

697
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:08,856
And who is this young girl?

698
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,840
This is the successor of
the Jiang family's acupuncture sect,

699
00:36:11,908 --> 00:36:12,989
Sun Tou Tou.

700
00:36:16,503 --> 00:36:18,023
So, she's my junior sister.

701
00:36:23,102 --> 00:36:24,022
Don't worry.

702
00:36:24,102 --> 00:36:26,862
I will take care of everything.

703
00:36:27,503 --> 00:36:28,662
Okay, bye.

704
00:36:30,943 --> 00:36:32,623
Li Quan, are you here to see Mr Wu?

705
00:36:32,703 --> 00:36:33,543
Why didn't you go in?

706
00:36:36,102 --> 00:36:36,902
Please come in.

707
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,863
Mr Wu, I've printed out
the documents for the meeting later.

708
00:36:39,943 --> 00:36:42,142
-Let me know if you need anything else.
-Okay.

709
00:36:46,756 --> 00:36:47,556
Okay.

710
00:36:47,823 --> 00:36:49,302
I need copies of this material.

711
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,228
One for everyone.
We need it for the meeting later.

712
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:52,109
Got it.

713
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:14,230
How can I help you?

714
00:37:16,843 --> 00:37:17,763
Is it true?

715
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,239
What do you mean?

716
00:37:24,369 --> 00:37:27,275
Sun Tou Tou isn't the successor
of the Jiang family's acupuncture sect,

717
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:28,960
is she?

718
00:37:31,736 --> 00:37:33,389
Does this have anything to do with you?

719
00:37:34,463 --> 00:37:35,342
It does.

720
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,240
I used to think

721
00:37:39,723 --> 00:37:41,223
that I didn't have any inheritance,

722
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:43,342
that I didn't come from a good family,

723
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,783
so I couldn't reach the heights
like all of you.

724
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,373
But what about Sun Tou Tou?

725
00:37:49,236 --> 00:37:50,196
She is nobody.

726
00:37:51,136 --> 00:37:53,136
Why could she be the chosen successor?

727
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,560
And what about me?

728
00:37:56,548 --> 00:37:58,389
I studied diligently.

729
00:37:58,602 --> 00:37:59,762
I got into university,

730
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,880
pursued a postgraduate degree,

731
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:06,229
but I'm not accepted in this city.

732
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,703
If you can choose any random person

733
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:13,369
to be the successor,

734
00:38:13,909 --> 00:38:16,189
then why can't it be me?

735
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,320
Is it the will of God
for people like you

736
00:38:19,362 --> 00:38:20,759
to oppress poor students like us,

737
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,799
manipulating everything at your whim?

738
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,480
Li Quan,

739
00:38:27,542 --> 00:38:29,623
haven't I helped you enough?

740
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:35,120
You can't expect me to do

741
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:38,061
illegal things just to help you, right?

742
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,081
What illegal things
have I asked you to do?

743
00:38:40,215 --> 00:38:43,289
I just want you to get our medicine
covered by medical insurance.

744
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,000
It's such a small favour,
and yet you won't help me.

745
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,000
You could easily change

746
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:48,390
Sun Tou Tou's life.

747
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,113
Why are you willing
to help her but not me?

748
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,440
Zhao Li Quan,

749
00:38:54,515 --> 00:38:55,396
I'm warning you,

750
00:38:56,222 --> 00:38:58,863
I haven't done anything wrong to you.

751
00:38:59,413 --> 00:39:00,422
Whatever I'm doing,

752
00:39:00,503 --> 00:39:02,183
I don't need to explain anything to you.

753
00:39:02,263 --> 00:39:04,943
I respected you so much!
Why did you deceive me?

754
00:39:07,023 --> 00:39:09,142
I respected you,
felt grateful towards you.

755
00:39:09,902 --> 00:39:13,342
I held you in high regard,
You were like shining beacons

756
00:39:14,182 --> 00:39:15,542
of goodness in my heart.

757
00:39:15,622 --> 00:39:17,183
I wanted to become like you!

758
00:39:17,263 --> 00:39:18,463
But what about you?

759
00:39:18,543 --> 00:39:20,400
What have you been doing behind my back?

760
00:39:20,862 --> 00:39:22,423
Why are you willing
to help Sun Tou Tou?

761
00:39:22,509 --> 00:39:23,949
Who is she?

762
00:39:24,675 --> 00:39:25,475
Li Quan,

763
00:39:26,902 --> 00:39:28,743
things are not as you think.

764
00:39:29,622 --> 00:39:31,223
You're too agitated now.

765
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,639
This isn't the right time
to discuss about this.

766
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:34,841
Let's talk again

767
00:39:35,776 --> 00:39:36,815
when you've calmed down.

768
00:39:38,797 --> 00:39:40,143
I'm already late for my meeting.

769
00:39:42,063 --> 00:39:43,262
You can go. I will find out

770
00:39:43,342 --> 00:39:44,342
who Sun Tou Tou really is

771
00:39:44,422 --> 00:39:46,290
and why she's worth
all this help from you.

772
00:39:47,422 --> 00:39:48,703
What are you doing?

773
00:39:48,783 --> 00:39:50,862
Get away from me! Now you're scared.

774
00:40:13,582 --> 00:40:15,983
Somebody, help!

775
00:40:16,503 --> 00:40:17,463
Help!

776
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,741
-What's wrong?
-What's wrong?

777
00:40:18,822 --> 00:40:20,223
-Mr Wu!
-Mr Wu, are you okay?

778
00:40:20,342 --> 00:40:22,268
-What happened to Mr Wu?
-What happened, Li Quan?

779
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,037
(Jiangzhou People's Hospital)

780
00:40:35,303 --> 00:40:37,063
His situation is not good.

781
00:40:37,303 --> 00:40:38,582
From the scans,

782
00:40:39,229 --> 00:40:41,350
his frontal lobe blood vessels
are deformed.

783
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,560
His sudden fall has triggered
a cerebral haemorrhage.

784
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,160
(Shen Xin)
The bleeding is significant.

785
00:40:45,202 --> 00:40:46,520
Even with surgery,

786
00:40:46,783 --> 00:40:49,102
the prognosis may not be favourable.

787
00:40:49,742 --> 00:40:52,262
Shen Xin, we are close friends.

788
00:40:52,543 --> 00:40:53,969
So, I will just be honest with you.

789
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:55,822
This surgery,

790
00:40:56,596 --> 00:40:57,589
it's better to give up

791
00:40:57,942 --> 00:40:58,742
than to perform it.

792
00:40:59,422 --> 00:41:01,303
Giving up might bring short-term pain,

793
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,908
but if we operate
and he ends up in a vegetative state,

794
00:41:03,989 --> 00:41:05,110
lying in coma forever,

795
00:41:05,349 --> 00:41:06,668
your family will have to suffer.

796
00:41:12,775 --> 00:41:13,856
Listen to me,

797
00:41:14,348 --> 00:41:16,469
I've been friends with Wu
for many years.

798
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:17,726
This is hard for me too.

799
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,560
But you need to be rational.

800
00:41:20,655 --> 00:41:21,749
If you let him go now,

801
00:41:22,422 --> 00:41:23,862
he won't experience any more pain.

802
00:41:24,382 --> 00:41:26,382
It will be difficult for your family,

803
00:41:27,017 --> 00:41:29,696
but time will heal you.

804
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,642
We are all medical professionals.

805
00:41:32,182 --> 00:41:33,063
I suppose

806
00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:35,355
I don't need to say anymore on this.

807
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:38,388
Thank you, Li.

808
00:41:40,543 --> 00:41:42,102
I understand everything

809
00:41:42,822 --> 00:41:43,622
you just said.

810
00:41:44,582 --> 00:41:45,382
However,

811
00:41:46,862 --> 00:41:48,743
I can't give up on Wu.

812
00:41:50,238 --> 00:41:51,959
My mother-in-law is waiting outside.

813
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:52,840
She has taken her blood pressure pill,

814
00:41:52,902 --> 00:41:54,663
but her blood pressure
is still over 200.

815
00:41:54,823 --> 00:41:55,623
Tell me,

816
00:41:56,589 --> 00:41:58,228
do you have the courage to go out

817
00:41:58,862 --> 00:42:00,262
and tell her to give up on her son?

818
00:42:00,303 --> 00:42:01,143
We might...

819
00:42:01,182 --> 00:42:02,662
We might lose two lives then.

820
00:42:13,469 --> 00:42:14,310
Don't worry.

821
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:16,609
If the surgery fails,

822
00:42:17,542 --> 00:42:18,462
I won't blame you.

823
00:42:19,116 --> 00:42:20,635
The worst case scenario is

824
00:42:24,503 --> 00:42:25,943
he will become a vegetable, right?

825
00:42:28,943 --> 00:42:29,822
I will accept it.

826
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:37,169
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

827
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:38,650
