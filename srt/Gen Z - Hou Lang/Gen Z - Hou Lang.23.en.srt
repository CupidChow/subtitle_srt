00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,835
(Gen Z)

2
00:01:35,727 --> 00:01:37,391
(Episode 23)

3
00:01:39,227 --> 00:01:40,867
I want to try again.

4
00:01:41,227 --> 00:01:41,867
So, I

5
00:01:42,546 --> 00:01:45,026
flew halfway around the world
to come and look for you.

6
00:01:48,507 --> 00:01:50,026
How do you know me?

7
00:01:53,746 --> 00:01:54,947
I read the article you wrote,

8
00:01:56,227 --> 00:01:57,186
"Understanding of TCM".

9
00:01:57,467 --> 00:01:58,307
In the article,

10
00:01:59,547 --> 00:02:01,426
there was a patient about my age

11
00:02:01,947 --> 00:02:02,987
and had lung disease.

12
00:02:03,627 --> 00:02:04,867
You cured him.

13
00:02:05,547 --> 00:02:06,787
So, I came to you.

14
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:08,586
Mdm. Bairie.

15
00:02:08,987 --> 00:02:09,746
My surname is Bai.

16
00:02:10,307 --> 00:02:11,586
My name is Jasmine.

17
00:02:12,426 --> 00:02:13,866
You can just call me Mo Li.

18
00:02:15,106 --> 00:02:15,627
Mo Li?

19
00:02:15,906 --> 00:02:16,507
Yes, Mo Li.

20
00:02:18,866 --> 00:02:19,586
Bai Mo Li.

21
00:02:20,147 --> 00:02:21,027
Bai Mo Li.

22
00:02:21,706 --> 00:02:22,586
What a beautiful name.

23
00:02:22,706 --> 00:02:23,307
Thank you.

24
00:02:25,347 --> 00:02:26,426
Well, it's like this.

25
00:02:27,467 --> 00:02:29,866
The treatment for Chinese medicine,

26
00:02:30,426 --> 00:02:33,827
although the disease
shares the same name,

27
00:02:33,827 --> 00:02:35,066
in Western medicine,

28
00:02:35,066 --> 00:02:37,906
the doctor will
check the patient's weight

29
00:02:38,546 --> 00:02:41,266
and other indexes

30
00:02:41,506 --> 00:02:42,466
before prescribing medication for you.

31
00:02:42,866 --> 00:02:43,707
But in Chinese medicine,

32
00:02:44,466 --> 00:02:46,786
though it's the same disease,
the lung disease,

33
00:02:47,506 --> 00:02:48,826
the symptoms are different.

34
00:02:49,427 --> 00:02:50,427
My prescription

35
00:02:50,786 --> 00:02:51,947
will also be different.

36
00:02:52,347 --> 00:02:54,266
I trust you more with what you said.

37
00:02:55,906 --> 00:02:58,027
Each of us in this world is

38
00:02:59,307 --> 00:03:00,027
unique.

39
00:03:02,107 --> 00:03:02,586
You're right.

40
00:03:05,786 --> 00:03:07,027
Tell me then.

41
00:03:07,826 --> 00:03:09,186
Besides coughing,

42
00:03:09,826 --> 00:03:10,866
do you feel not well?

43
00:03:14,506 --> 00:03:15,866
No, nothing else.

44
00:03:16,067 --> 00:03:17,186
But I'm just tired.

45
00:03:17,866 --> 00:03:18,947
-Tired?
-Yes, tired.

46
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:21,707
Tiredness is also a disease.

47
00:03:23,826 --> 00:03:24,427
Hi, front desk.

48
00:03:24,947 --> 00:03:25,987
Please ask Tou Tou to come over.

49
00:03:28,786 --> 00:03:30,067
-Well, guys!
-Keep your voice down!

50
00:03:32,307 --> 00:03:33,067
Guys.

51
00:03:33,506 --> 00:03:35,067
If you want me dead,
please let me know the reason.

52
00:03:35,067 --> 00:03:36,826
What unforgivable matter have I done?

53
00:03:37,786 --> 00:03:38,987
Where did this thing come from? Tell us!

54
00:03:38,987 --> 00:03:40,427
-From my dad.
-From your dad?

55
00:03:40,866 --> 00:03:41,506
Liu Zi Hong.

56
00:03:43,066 --> 00:03:44,226
We don't have time to play with you.

57
00:03:44,866 --> 00:03:45,786
Be honest with us!

58
00:03:46,387 --> 00:03:48,066
It's from my dad, really.
I didn't lie to you.

59
00:03:49,066 --> 00:03:49,586
What?

60
00:03:50,267 --> 00:03:51,467
Isn't this good stuff?

61
00:03:52,267 --> 00:03:54,307
I don't know about it, but
my dad treats it as a precious item.

62
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:55,506
Good.

63
00:03:56,506 --> 00:03:57,066
Very good.

64
00:03:58,187 --> 00:03:59,226
It is good stuff.

65
00:03:59,866 --> 00:04:00,467
Look.

66
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,506
I've told you, it's a good stuff.

67
00:04:02,747 --> 00:04:04,107
My dad brought it back
in the middle of the night

68
00:04:04,107 --> 00:04:05,346
and secretly hide it.

69
00:04:05,346 --> 00:04:06,426
This thing must be precious.

70
00:04:08,786 --> 00:04:10,346
If I hadn't taken it on his way,

71
00:04:10,706 --> 00:04:12,426
this thing would have gotten
into his safe.

72
00:04:17,827 --> 00:04:18,506
Tell us then.

73
00:04:19,066 --> 00:04:20,866
Why did you bring this to me?

74
00:04:22,947 --> 00:04:23,626
Listen.

75
00:04:23,907 --> 00:04:25,187
This old saying is good.

76
00:04:25,747 --> 00:04:26,840
"Though it was
a minor favor from others,

77
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:28,226
we should reciprocate with huge favor."

78
00:04:28,586 --> 00:04:29,146
At that time,

79
00:04:29,586 --> 00:04:30,506
you helped me

80
00:04:30,907 --> 00:04:32,786
and my dad agreed
to let me continue to be a trainee.

81
00:04:33,146 --> 00:04:34,706
So, I must do something to repay you.

82
00:04:36,626 --> 00:04:37,187
Besides,

83
00:04:37,586 --> 00:04:40,786
you're now my number-one fan.

84
00:04:40,786 --> 00:04:41,947
As the idol,

85
00:04:42,547 --> 00:04:43,907
it's normal to give you some benefits.

86
00:04:51,626 --> 00:04:53,307
You know my relationship with my dad.

87
00:04:54,146 --> 00:04:55,506
I just wanted to make him feel bad.

88
00:04:58,066 --> 00:04:59,187
He said it could save lives.

89
00:05:00,107 --> 00:05:01,947
I was thinking his friends
whom he always has drinks with

90
00:05:01,947 --> 00:05:03,107
aren't those who cherish lives.

91
00:05:04,107 --> 00:05:05,107
Since this is good stuff,

92
00:05:05,387 --> 00:05:06,267
it must be better to give you this

93
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:08,187
rather than he keeps it.

94
00:05:09,947 --> 00:05:11,547
You've ruined
your dad's important matter.

95
00:05:11,947 --> 00:05:13,706
You've ruined our important matter too.

96
00:05:18,786 --> 00:05:19,586
This thing

97
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:21,346
can really save lives.

98
00:05:21,547 --> 00:05:23,426
It's to save
the "life" of our apprentice class.

99
00:05:23,747 --> 00:05:25,226
It's to save our lives!

100
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:27,667
You did something bad, do you know that?

101
00:05:29,907 --> 00:05:31,346
What do you mean?

102
00:05:33,027 --> 00:05:34,387
Don't exaggerate it.

103
00:05:35,547 --> 00:05:37,027
I didn't mean it.

104
00:05:39,426 --> 00:05:40,667
It's too late to say anything now.

105
00:05:40,667 --> 00:05:42,027
Your dad's orchard has been mortgaged.

106
00:05:42,267 --> 00:05:43,667
And we don't have a place
to run the apprentice class.

107
00:05:44,146 --> 00:05:46,226
Even if you have ten wild ginseng now,

108
00:05:46,226 --> 00:05:47,146
it won't help anything at all.

109
00:05:51,346 --> 00:05:52,026
Brother.

110
00:05:52,987 --> 00:05:54,226
Listen to my advice.

111
00:05:56,226 --> 00:05:57,186
Don't be an idol.

112
00:05:58,226 --> 00:05:59,626
Okay? Don't be an idol.

113
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,387
You've got no brain for this.

114
00:06:02,626 --> 00:06:03,786
You're not able to do this.

115
00:06:04,147 --> 00:06:05,026
You won't become popular!

116
00:06:05,827 --> 00:06:06,587
Do you understand?

117
00:06:07,107 --> 00:06:09,147
Tou Tou, Mr. Ren is looking for you.

118
00:06:09,707 --> 00:06:10,346
Coming.

119
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:27,026
Is it so hard to do something good?

120
00:06:36,947 --> 00:06:39,466
Consultation is the most important part
in Chinese medicine.

121
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:42,186
Tou Tou, remember this.

122
00:06:42,506 --> 00:06:43,587
What should we ask?

123
00:06:50,906 --> 00:06:53,707
First, ask about cold and hot.
Second, ask about sweating.

124
00:06:54,506 --> 00:06:56,387
Third, ask about the head and body.
Fourth, ask about stool.

125
00:06:57,306 --> 00:06:59,987
Five, ask about diet.
Six, ask about the chest.

126
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:04,107
Seven, ask about hearing.
Eight, distinguish the thirstiness.

127
00:07:04,387 --> 00:07:08,707
Nine, check for the Yin and Yang.

128
00:07:08,707 --> 00:07:09,466
That's incorrect.

129
00:07:10,587 --> 00:07:12,147
It should be,
"Nine, ask about old diseases."

130
00:07:12,587 --> 00:07:14,147
Ten, ask about causes.

131
00:07:14,506 --> 00:07:16,026
You got it wrong.

132
00:07:16,867 --> 00:07:18,066
You didn't know that
I know about it, right?

133
00:07:24,947 --> 00:07:26,346
What is the eye in Chinese medicine?

134
00:07:30,707 --> 00:07:33,506
Before we talk about
the first aid of Chinese medicine,

135
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:35,867
let me ask you this.

136
00:07:36,107 --> 00:07:38,226
In Chinese medicine,
what is the eye of a human?

137
00:07:39,746 --> 00:07:40,387
Yin and yang.

138
00:07:40,746 --> 00:07:41,547
Yes, you've gotten in right.

139
00:07:42,147 --> 00:07:42,707
Yin and yang.

140
00:07:43,306 --> 00:07:44,306
The eyes in Chinese medicine...

141
00:07:45,346 --> 00:07:46,147
To check for yin and yang.

142
00:07:46,987 --> 00:07:48,667
How could I be wrong
if it can check for yin and yang?

143
00:07:58,466 --> 00:08:00,267
You can speak Mandarin well.

144
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:02,506
You can understand our conversation.

145
00:08:03,427 --> 00:08:05,346
It's not easy to lead students now.

146
00:08:05,346 --> 00:08:07,306
She even picks on her teacher's fault.

147
00:08:09,107 --> 00:08:11,306
No, I didn't.

148
00:08:13,147 --> 00:08:14,186
You remind me of

149
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,827
my piano teacher when I was young.

150
00:08:18,267 --> 00:08:19,906
Because of her, I became

151
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,867
a teacher.

152
00:08:33,786 --> 00:08:34,506
Madam.

153
00:08:35,387 --> 00:08:36,947
Why did you come to pick him up today?

154
00:08:36,947 --> 00:08:37,786
Where is Le Le's mother?

155
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:38,867
Le Le.

156
00:08:39,506 --> 00:08:40,466
Tell Ms. Zhang.

157
00:08:41,026 --> 00:08:43,346
You're going to Grandma's house
during the weekend, right?

158
00:08:43,746 --> 00:08:44,346
Right?

159
00:08:45,226 --> 00:08:45,987
Ms. Zhang.

160
00:08:45,987 --> 00:08:48,387
Grandma's house has a big car

161
00:08:48,786 --> 00:08:51,346
and a robot taller than me.

162
00:08:51,346 --> 00:08:52,387
That's good.

163
00:08:52,387 --> 00:08:54,107
Did you tell your mom

164
00:08:54,107 --> 00:08:55,387
that you're going to
Grandma's house and play today?

165
00:08:55,387 --> 00:08:56,226
Ms. Zhang.

166
00:08:56,746 --> 00:08:57,466
About Le Le

167
00:08:57,906 --> 00:08:58,906
going home with me,

168
00:08:59,387 --> 00:09:00,827
Cheng Ying knows about it.

169
00:09:00,827 --> 00:09:02,066
Don't worry.

170
00:09:02,466 --> 00:09:03,827
Le Le, say goodbye to Ms. Zhang.

171
00:09:04,226 --> 00:09:05,226
Let's go home.

172
00:09:05,506 --> 00:09:06,147
Goodbye, teacher.

173
00:09:06,147 --> 00:09:06,987
I'm sorry.

174
00:09:07,746 --> 00:09:09,947
Ms. Zhang, I'm late
as there are traffics on the road.

175
00:09:10,906 --> 00:09:11,427
Le Le.

176
00:09:12,226 --> 00:09:13,707
What did I tell you this morning?

177
00:09:14,147 --> 00:09:15,147
In the future, after class ends,

178
00:09:15,306 --> 00:09:17,066
you can only wait for me to pick you up.

179
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:19,306
You can't leave with strangers.

180
00:09:19,587 --> 00:09:20,587
Do you remember?

181
00:09:20,746 --> 00:09:21,387
Cheng Ying.

182
00:09:21,867 --> 00:09:22,987
What do you mean by that?

183
00:09:23,466 --> 00:09:24,867
Le Le is my grandson. I'm his grandma.

184
00:09:24,867 --> 00:09:26,226
Why did I become a stranger?

185
00:09:26,346 --> 00:09:27,746
I don't mean anything.

186
00:09:28,147 --> 00:09:28,906
He is young.

187
00:09:28,906 --> 00:09:30,186
His safety awareness is weak.

188
00:09:30,466 --> 00:09:31,746
I must remind him repeatedly.

189
00:09:31,746 --> 00:09:33,667
His grandma picks him up today

190
00:09:34,026 --> 00:09:35,066
and his dad picks him up tomorrow.

191
00:09:35,547 --> 00:09:36,987
Someday, a strange aunt

192
00:09:36,987 --> 00:09:38,026
can pick up my son too.

193
00:09:38,026 --> 00:09:38,667
That would be bad.

194
00:09:40,066 --> 00:09:41,867
You have a
new granddaughter now, aren't you?

195
00:09:42,107 --> 00:09:43,466
It that's the case, you don't

196
00:09:43,626 --> 00:09:44,707
have to bother about
Le Le's matter anymore.

197
00:09:44,707 --> 00:09:45,066
Let's go.

198
00:09:45,667 --> 00:09:46,667
What are you doing?

199
00:09:47,226 --> 00:09:50,107
He's spending the weekend
with his dad every fortnight.

200
00:09:51,147 --> 00:09:52,267
Put Le Le down.

201
00:09:52,667 --> 00:09:54,506
I told you very clearly on that day.

202
00:09:54,707 --> 00:09:55,226
In future,

203
00:09:55,466 --> 00:09:57,066
Le Le has nothing to do
with you anymore.

204
00:09:57,466 --> 00:09:57,827
Let's go.

205
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:01,707
-What are you doing?
-Nothing to do with us?

206
00:10:02,066 --> 00:10:03,506
How could he have nothing to do with us?

207
00:10:03,867 --> 00:10:04,346
Yes,

208
00:10:04,626 --> 00:10:06,107
you have nothing to do with us.

209
00:10:06,267 --> 00:10:08,066
But Le Le is my eldest grandson!

210
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:09,267
The court ruled that

211
00:10:09,267 --> 00:10:11,227
he spends time
with his dad every fortnight.

212
00:10:11,227 --> 00:10:13,426
Do you think you can overrule this
by just telling me?

213
00:10:13,907 --> 00:10:14,907
You're joking!

214
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:16,227
Let me tell you then.

215
00:10:16,227 --> 00:10:18,186
I will go to court and appeal.

216
00:10:18,306 --> 00:10:18,986
In the future,

217
00:10:19,506 --> 00:10:21,426
my son has nothing to do with you!

218
00:10:21,426 --> 00:10:23,227
He is my son, not your grandson!

219
00:10:23,227 --> 00:10:24,387
Put Le Le down!

220
00:10:24,387 --> 00:10:25,267
What are you doing?

221
00:10:44,866 --> 00:10:46,666
I'll prescribe some medicine for you

222
00:10:46,947 --> 00:10:48,426
to regulate your body.

223
00:10:55,347 --> 00:10:56,347
Prof. Ren.

224
00:10:56,986 --> 00:10:59,347
Can my illness really be cured?

225
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:00,546
Let's try.

226
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:05,106
You took a lot of antibiotics.

227
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:07,387
Antibiotics

228
00:11:08,227 --> 00:11:09,907
are very good medicine.

229
00:11:10,267 --> 00:11:11,106
If you take antibiotics,

230
00:11:11,106 --> 00:11:13,506
it can treat your illness
and it is life-saving.

231
00:11:13,787 --> 00:11:16,027
But if you consume it for a long time,

232
00:11:16,347 --> 00:11:17,746
your immunity

233
00:11:18,306 --> 00:11:19,426
will become weak.

234
00:11:20,227 --> 00:11:21,866
Take a few doses of this medicine

235
00:11:22,267 --> 00:11:24,106
to regulate your body functions

236
00:11:24,106 --> 00:11:25,746
so that it can go back to normal.

237
00:11:26,787 --> 00:11:28,267
Preserve your yang energy.

238
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:29,947
You're going to war now.

239
00:11:30,587 --> 00:11:31,947
Take care of your body first

240
00:11:32,426 --> 00:11:33,707
so that you can fight.

241
00:11:35,306 --> 00:11:35,866
Okay.

242
00:11:40,506 --> 00:11:41,866
Where are you staying?

243
00:11:43,387 --> 00:11:44,546
Hyatt Hotel.

244
00:11:45,426 --> 00:11:46,626
Hyatt?

245
00:11:47,186 --> 00:11:47,707
That's right.

246
00:11:48,546 --> 00:11:50,626
This hotel is quite expensive.

247
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:55,827
Your illness

248
00:11:56,106 --> 00:11:58,387
cannot be cured in a day or two.

249
00:11:58,387 --> 00:12:00,707
I suggest you change the hotel.

250
00:12:01,506 --> 00:12:03,746
Move closer to the medical center.

251
00:12:04,027 --> 00:12:04,787
By doing that,

252
00:12:05,066 --> 00:12:06,986
you can save a lot of expenses.

253
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:08,866
Okay.

254
00:12:09,306 --> 00:12:10,147
I'll listen to you.

255
00:12:10,866 --> 00:12:12,066
As for your diet,

256
00:12:12,866 --> 00:12:14,306
avoid fruits for now.

257
00:12:15,347 --> 00:12:17,587
Don't eat chilled food, okay?

258
00:12:18,186 --> 00:12:18,827
Okay.

259
00:12:19,866 --> 00:12:21,306
Who is with you now?

260
00:12:21,787 --> 00:12:23,467
My granddaughter will come

261
00:12:23,986 --> 00:12:24,947
after two days.

262
00:12:25,546 --> 00:12:26,306
Don't worry.

263
00:12:26,546 --> 00:12:29,027
Someone from the medical center
will keep in touch with you

264
00:12:29,267 --> 00:12:32,426
until your granddaughter arrives, okay?

265
00:12:32,827 --> 00:12:33,186
Okay.

266
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:34,907
With that, you can rest assured

267
00:12:34,907 --> 00:12:35,907
and I'll be at ease too.

268
00:12:36,426 --> 00:12:36,986
Okay.

269
00:12:37,986 --> 00:12:38,626
Tou Tou.

270
00:12:39,106 --> 00:12:40,027
Inform Zhu Xia

271
00:12:40,306 --> 00:12:42,587
to keep in touch with Bai Mo Li.

272
00:12:43,227 --> 00:12:43,746
Okay.

273
00:12:44,267 --> 00:12:45,467
You must be persistence

274
00:12:45,467 --> 00:12:46,587
in taking the medicine I prescribe you.

275
00:12:46,587 --> 00:12:48,147
Regulate your body first.

276
00:12:49,827 --> 00:12:50,387
Okay.

277
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:51,387
I'll work hard.

278
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:54,147
I'll work hard also.

279
00:12:56,347 --> 00:12:57,626
I'll work hard too.

280
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,027
I will work hard too

281
00:13:07,947 --> 00:13:08,746
These

282
00:13:09,027 --> 00:13:12,666
are some precautions and avoidance
of food during the medication.

283
00:13:13,186 --> 00:13:13,986
Can you see it?

284
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:16,546
Have a look when you go back.

285
00:13:17,907 --> 00:13:18,387
Okay.

286
00:13:18,707 --> 00:13:20,546
Also, this one.

287
00:13:21,746 --> 00:13:22,947
It's for foot soaking.

288
00:13:23,227 --> 00:13:25,467
I've packed it for you.

289
00:13:25,467 --> 00:13:26,106
Let me take a look.

290
00:13:26,467 --> 00:13:28,947
You may not have a foot bath pail,
so I got you one.

291
00:13:28,947 --> 00:13:30,666
A new foot bath pail. This one.

292
00:13:31,106 --> 00:13:32,306
-Thank you.
-It's a new one.

293
00:13:32,467 --> 00:13:32,827
Thanks.

294
00:13:32,827 --> 00:13:35,027
Just put it in and soak your feet.

295
00:13:35,546 --> 00:13:36,546
My master has told you.

296
00:13:36,707 --> 00:13:37,787
You need to get more sunlight.

297
00:13:38,827 --> 00:13:40,707
Getting more sunlight
is good for health.

298
00:13:41,347 --> 00:13:42,147
-Okay?
-Okay.

299
00:13:44,186 --> 00:13:45,827
You came all the way here
to treat your illness.

300
00:13:46,546 --> 00:13:49,147
Just receive the treatment
at ease and with a piece of mind.

301
00:13:50,186 --> 00:13:51,546
If my master
said the illness can be cured,

302
00:13:52,027 --> 00:13:52,947
there surely be no problem.

303
00:13:53,147 --> 00:13:54,467
All of us need to work hard.

304
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:56,267
Alright, let me keep it.

305
00:13:57,066 --> 00:13:58,426
I know he's great.

306
00:13:59,106 --> 00:14:01,347
I trust my instincts and choices.

307
00:14:01,347 --> 00:14:02,746
I have been sick
for more than three years.

308
00:14:03,306 --> 00:14:04,066
I'm not afraid

309
00:14:04,267 --> 00:14:06,027
of using another three years

310
00:14:06,027 --> 00:14:07,546
to fight off the illness
with the doctor.

311
00:14:08,106 --> 00:14:09,986
Fight off the illness!

312
00:14:09,986 --> 00:14:10,746
Tou Tou.

313
00:14:11,066 --> 00:14:13,787
Is she Mdm. Bai that
Prof. Ren wanted me to take care of?

314
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:16,787
Ms. Xia, this is Granny Mo Li.

315
00:14:16,947 --> 00:14:17,506
Hello.

316
00:14:18,267 --> 00:14:19,186
Ms. Xia.

317
00:14:19,306 --> 00:14:22,027
If there is any problem or any requests,

318
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,546
you can just look for her.

319
00:14:23,907 --> 00:14:24,506
Okay.

320
00:14:24,506 --> 00:14:26,106
I'll go and check
if the medicine is ready.

321
00:14:26,306 --> 00:14:26,827
Okay.

322
00:14:26,827 --> 00:14:28,546
Okay. Sorry for troubling you.

323
00:14:29,347 --> 00:14:31,506
Don't be so polite. No trouble at all.

324
00:14:31,986 --> 00:14:33,707
I am also
a family member of the patient.

325
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:36,227
I know very well what patients need.

326
00:14:36,227 --> 00:14:38,387
I will definitely take good care of you

327
00:14:38,387 --> 00:14:39,426
until your granddaughter arrives.

328
00:14:40,306 --> 00:14:41,907
Thank you.

329
00:14:41,907 --> 00:14:42,947
You're welcome.

330
00:14:49,707 --> 00:14:51,306
You are the kid's grandma?

331
00:14:52,066 --> 00:14:52,666
Biological grandma?

332
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:57,267
And you are the kid's mother?

333
00:14:57,827 --> 00:14:58,347
That's right.

334
00:14:59,186 --> 00:14:59,866
Biological mother?

335
00:15:00,827 --> 00:15:01,426
Certainly.

336
00:15:01,426 --> 00:15:02,746
Mr. Police.

337
00:15:02,746 --> 00:15:04,306
You're finally here. Let me tell you.

338
00:15:04,306 --> 00:15:07,306
You must call the shots for me.

339
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:08,467
-Okay, okay.
-Let me tell you.

340
00:15:08,546 --> 00:15:10,506
This woman didn't allow me
to take my grandson with me.

341
00:15:10,506 --> 00:15:12,267
She even hit me!

342
00:15:12,267 --> 00:15:14,986
You wanted to take my son away
without my permission.

343
00:15:15,267 --> 00:15:16,587
Of course,
I won't let you take him away!

344
00:15:17,066 --> 00:15:18,947
When I divorced, I got the custody.

345
00:15:19,106 --> 00:15:20,546
The court ruled that

346
00:15:20,546 --> 00:15:21,787
my eldest grandson will spend

347
00:15:22,506 --> 00:15:24,147
his weekend with his dad
every fortnight!

348
00:15:24,147 --> 00:15:25,227
It's different now.

349
00:15:25,707 --> 00:15:27,147
Since you lied to me last time,

350
00:15:27,306 --> 00:15:29,066
in the future, I will never allow my son

351
00:15:29,066 --> 00:15:31,306
to simply go to a stranger's house!

352
00:15:31,587 --> 00:15:33,387
I'm going through
the legal process again.

353
00:15:33,907 --> 00:15:34,746
Okay.

354
00:15:34,986 --> 00:15:36,306
You want a new trial, don't you?

355
00:15:36,506 --> 00:15:37,147
Okay!

356
00:15:37,267 --> 00:15:39,907
I want to get back the custody
of my grandson!

357
00:15:39,907 --> 00:15:40,426
Let me tell you.

358
00:15:40,947 --> 00:15:43,626
Le Le's custody was awarded to you

359
00:15:43,626 --> 00:15:45,147
because we pitied you for being a woman

360
00:15:45,147 --> 00:15:46,866
and Le Le's dad couldn't afford it.

361
00:15:46,866 --> 00:15:49,267
Look at your
unreasonable mouth and look now,

362
00:15:49,267 --> 00:15:50,347
let's meet in court!

363
00:15:50,347 --> 00:15:52,106
-What do you mean?
-What do I mean?

364
00:15:52,106 --> 00:15:54,666
-Madam, stop talking.
-No wonder my son looks down on you.

365
00:15:54,986 --> 00:15:57,186
You're emotionally unstable.

366
00:15:57,186 --> 00:15:59,306
If Le Le sees you,
he will look down on you.

367
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:01,787
You're talking nonsense!

368
00:16:02,147 --> 00:16:03,186
-You...
-Calm down.

369
00:16:03,186 --> 00:16:04,267
Who is emotionally unstable?

370
00:16:04,267 --> 00:16:05,866
I took the video. Did you see it?
Do you hear what she says?

371
00:16:05,866 --> 00:16:07,506
-Madam.
-Your son who cheated on me!

372
00:16:08,066 --> 00:16:09,947
That's the good son you taught!

373
00:16:09,947 --> 00:16:10,546
Madam.

374
00:16:11,347 --> 00:16:12,787
Madam, calm down.

375
00:16:12,787 --> 00:16:13,986
Calm down!

376
00:16:13,986 --> 00:16:15,587
Put down your phone!

377
00:16:15,866 --> 00:16:17,707
Madam, calm down!

378
00:16:18,827 --> 00:16:20,147
Do you still want the keep the kid?

379
00:16:20,147 --> 00:16:21,186
You're weak.

380
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:23,467
Ms. Cheng.

381
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,707
Do you want me
to take the kid away first?

382
00:16:27,707 --> 00:16:28,546
She wants to fight with me?

383
00:16:29,426 --> 00:16:30,866
Stop talking!

384
00:16:31,186 --> 00:16:31,587
I'm sorry.

385
00:16:31,746 --> 00:16:32,827
Can I be rest assured
if the kid is with her?

386
00:16:32,827 --> 00:16:34,147
I've scared you.

387
00:16:34,467 --> 00:16:35,866
I promise I will never do it again.

388
00:16:36,186 --> 00:16:38,787
No one can take you away from me.

389
00:16:39,506 --> 00:16:41,147
I will never let you leave me.

390
00:16:44,227 --> 00:16:44,947
Madam.

391
00:16:45,707 --> 00:16:47,147
Given the current situation,

392
00:16:47,347 --> 00:16:48,027
this week,

393
00:16:49,186 --> 00:16:51,227
let the grandma bring the kid back.

394
00:16:54,106 --> 00:16:54,626
No!

395
00:16:56,787 --> 00:16:57,267
First.

396
00:16:58,106 --> 00:17:00,027
You cannot reject
the father who has his right

397
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:01,506
to visit his son.

398
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:02,306
And,

399
00:17:02,587 --> 00:17:05,746
your current emotion isn't suitable
to be alone with the kid.

400
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:08,066
What's wrong with me now?

401
00:17:08,506 --> 00:17:09,506
What's wrong with me?

402
00:17:09,506 --> 00:17:11,147
Why can't I

403
00:17:11,147 --> 00:17:12,827
stay with my own kid?

404
00:17:12,827 --> 00:17:14,147
-Calm down.
-Madam, get up first.

405
00:17:14,147 --> 00:17:15,947
Le Le, don't go!

406
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:19,986
Le Le!

407
00:17:23,066 --> 00:17:23,866
Madam.

408
00:17:24,907 --> 00:17:26,666
If you really want to have your son,

409
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:28,066
you must control your emotions.

410
00:17:28,467 --> 00:17:30,147
Never let
this kind of thing happens again.

411
00:17:35,506 --> 00:17:38,066
Where did you take my son to?

412
00:17:49,546 --> 00:17:51,666
-Ms. Xia.
-What's the matter with you?

413
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:54,227
What happened to you?

414
00:17:54,546 --> 00:17:56,027
Didn't you go and pick Le Le up?

415
00:17:56,227 --> 00:17:56,707
I...

416
00:17:57,426 --> 00:17:59,666
I can't live anymore!

417
00:18:00,027 --> 00:18:01,227
Speak slowly.

418
00:18:01,227 --> 00:18:03,306
It's okay, don't cry.

419
00:18:03,827 --> 00:18:04,347
Don't cry.

420
00:18:13,746 --> 00:18:14,587
Prof. Ren.

421
00:18:14,907 --> 00:18:17,467
You know,
I think my illness can't be cured.

422
00:18:18,227 --> 00:18:20,947
I followed the methods you taught me
to control my emotion.

423
00:18:20,947 --> 00:18:22,227
I have controlled it.

424
00:18:22,986 --> 00:18:25,986
But why do all of them
keep pushing me hard?

425
00:18:27,787 --> 00:18:28,387
Why did you say so?

426
00:18:29,347 --> 00:18:31,066
They're too much!

427
00:18:31,227 --> 00:18:32,306
They always push their luck!

428
00:18:32,467 --> 00:18:33,787
My ex-mother-in-law

429
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:36,467
is going to fight for my kid now.

430
00:18:36,827 --> 00:18:38,347
If she takes my son away,

431
00:18:38,506 --> 00:18:40,186
I'll have nothing.

432
00:18:40,587 --> 00:18:41,867
But I also thought about it.

433
00:18:43,066 --> 00:18:44,947
If someone dares to take my son away,

434
00:18:46,066 --> 00:18:47,786
I will die with them.

435
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:52,426
You won't die with them.

436
00:18:55,066 --> 00:18:56,747
You're recovered, really.

437
00:18:57,627 --> 00:18:59,026
You're going to be reborn.

438
00:19:01,186 --> 00:19:02,026
Prof. Ren.

439
00:19:02,546 --> 00:19:03,827
I'm so mad at them

440
00:19:03,827 --> 00:19:05,107
yet you still make fun of me.

441
00:19:05,107 --> 00:19:06,306
I'm not making fun of you.

442
00:19:07,306 --> 00:19:08,906
Remember when you first came?

443
00:19:08,906 --> 00:19:10,587
You were very weak, weren't you?

444
00:19:11,306 --> 00:19:13,066
This time, you have hatred in you.

445
00:19:13,467 --> 00:19:15,107
And you're full of energy.

446
00:19:17,587 --> 00:19:18,386
Cheng Ying.

447
00:19:19,266 --> 00:19:20,507
Emotion

448
00:19:20,786 --> 00:19:22,107
is something each of us

449
00:19:22,347 --> 00:19:24,867
that we have to face for a lifetime.

450
00:19:25,386 --> 00:19:27,306
It's not something that can be realized

451
00:19:27,627 --> 00:19:29,386
or enlightened

452
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:30,786
after just one class.

453
00:19:31,507 --> 00:19:33,266
If that was the case,

454
00:19:33,747 --> 00:19:35,306
you would immediately
become a Buddha.

455
00:19:36,987 --> 00:19:38,947
You and I are mortal.

456
00:19:39,867 --> 00:19:42,467
We can't make something
happen just by wanting to do it.

457
00:19:43,227 --> 00:19:44,347
Emotion

458
00:19:45,306 --> 00:19:46,507
isn't for you to bear with it

459
00:19:46,707 --> 00:19:47,947
or control it.

460
00:19:49,266 --> 00:19:50,386
That's not healthy.

461
00:19:51,306 --> 00:19:52,947
It hurts you, actually.

462
00:19:54,587 --> 00:19:55,747
If you're emotional

463
00:19:56,867 --> 00:19:58,026
and you can resolve it,

464
00:19:58,827 --> 00:19:59,786
you're being fair,

465
00:20:01,107 --> 00:20:02,347
as in being fair and upright.

466
00:20:03,266 --> 00:20:04,867
What if you can't solve it?

467
00:20:06,627 --> 00:20:07,467
Well, just let it

468
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:10,266
gently release,

469
00:20:10,707 --> 00:20:12,987
not explode in anger.

470
00:20:13,107 --> 00:20:14,186
Isn't that one of the ways?

471
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:16,587
Being fair and upright,
gentle and moderate.

472
00:20:17,066 --> 00:20:17,987
If you can do

473
00:20:19,227 --> 00:20:20,827
any of these,

474
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:22,627
you are healthy.

475
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:24,827
Come.

476
00:20:25,827 --> 00:20:26,587
Let me check your pulse.

477
00:20:40,867 --> 00:20:41,306
Well,

478
00:20:41,507 --> 00:20:42,467
can my illness

479
00:20:43,426 --> 00:20:44,386
be cured?

480
00:20:44,747 --> 00:20:46,186
You must reconcile with yourself.

481
00:20:46,507 --> 00:20:47,146
Then you'll be fine.

482
00:20:50,306 --> 00:20:51,867
How do reconcile with myself?

483
00:20:53,546 --> 00:20:54,867
Look.

484
00:20:56,066 --> 00:20:59,026
Humans can control very little things.

485
00:20:59,306 --> 00:21:00,146
You can't

486
00:21:00,386 --> 00:21:03,467
control what others
think of you or say about you.

487
00:21:04,507 --> 00:21:05,227
What should you do then?

488
00:21:06,186 --> 00:21:07,227
Treat yourself better.

489
00:21:10,107 --> 00:21:12,386
I don't know how to treat myself better.

490
00:21:13,186 --> 00:21:15,867
Look, if you're happy,
would you still care about

491
00:21:16,146 --> 00:21:17,546
your previous unhappiness?

492
00:21:18,146 --> 00:21:20,186
It's just like
if you have one million now,

493
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:24,227
would you still care about
10 or 20 yuan you've lost?

494
00:21:31,386 --> 00:21:32,186
Remember this.

495
00:21:32,867 --> 00:21:34,227
You must put yourself down.

496
00:21:35,146 --> 00:21:36,666
You hate your ex-husband

497
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:38,026
and blame your mother-in-law.

498
00:21:38,827 --> 00:21:41,546
That's like using a knife on your chest.

499
00:21:41,947 --> 00:21:43,386
What kind of relationship

500
00:21:43,906 --> 00:21:45,347
would make you use

501
00:21:45,347 --> 00:21:47,266
self-harm to commemorate it?

502
00:21:50,467 --> 00:21:51,266
If you do this,

503
00:21:51,627 --> 00:21:53,507
you'll only hurt the one who loves you.

504
00:21:54,627 --> 00:21:55,627
For example, your son.

505
00:21:57,227 --> 00:21:59,587
It doesn't work at all on others.

506
00:22:01,467 --> 00:22:02,426
Put yourself down.

507
00:22:02,867 --> 00:22:03,587
That's very important.

508
00:22:05,347 --> 00:22:05,947
Alright.

509
00:22:06,347 --> 00:22:07,066
Don't cry.

510
00:22:07,747 --> 00:22:08,546
Go back now.

511
00:22:08,747 --> 00:22:09,627
I should get off work too.

512
00:22:10,627 --> 00:22:11,947
You haven't prescribed me medicine yet.

513
00:22:12,227 --> 00:22:13,707
I checked your pulse just now.

514
00:22:13,947 --> 00:22:14,707
It's very stable.

515
00:22:15,627 --> 00:22:16,947
The medicine was just a cover-up.

516
00:22:20,146 --> 00:22:21,786
Well, give me some

517
00:22:22,066 --> 00:22:23,306
cover-up medicine.

518
00:22:23,747 --> 00:22:24,786
The method you mentioned just now,

519
00:22:25,867 --> 00:22:27,386
I need to digest it.

520
00:22:54,507 --> 00:22:55,186
Peng Shi Yan.

521
00:22:58,786 --> 00:23:00,386
It's a day off

522
00:23:00,386 --> 00:23:02,026
but I was called over to do hard work.

523
00:23:02,227 --> 00:23:02,947
Mr. Ren.

524
00:23:03,146 --> 00:23:04,627
Today's dinner and supper

525
00:23:05,306 --> 00:23:06,146
are on you.

526
00:23:06,546 --> 00:23:07,467
Don't blame me.

527
00:23:07,467 --> 00:23:08,587
You are also a member
of the apprentice class.

528
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:09,507
This is what you should do.

529
00:23:11,467 --> 00:23:12,347
That's right.

530
00:23:12,546 --> 00:23:14,227
He is the class leader
yet has no sense of responsibility.

531
00:23:14,227 --> 00:23:15,906
He only knows complaining.

532
00:23:16,146 --> 00:23:16,747
That's right.

533
00:23:18,066 --> 00:23:20,227
Since when are you two so united?

534
00:23:21,947 --> 00:23:24,546
But our apprentice class
is in a poor state now, isn't it?

535
00:23:25,827 --> 00:23:26,987
Quan applied for a day off today.

536
00:23:26,987 --> 00:23:27,947
I guessed he went
to do a part-time job, right?

537
00:23:27,947 --> 00:23:29,227
Why didn't I see Ms. Yang the lawyer?

538
00:23:29,666 --> 00:23:31,227
I saw Ms. Dong is here.

539
00:23:31,947 --> 00:23:34,666
Didn't she praise herself that
she's Ms. Dong's favorite student?

540
00:23:35,467 --> 00:23:36,666
I didn't expect her
to be absent from Ms. Dong's class.

541
00:23:38,947 --> 00:23:41,107
Roubecca has been acting mysterious

542
00:23:41,107 --> 00:23:42,186
for several days.

543
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:44,546
She would disappear for a few hours.

544
00:23:44,546 --> 00:23:46,146
I don't know where she went.

545
00:23:46,426 --> 00:23:48,347
If you ask her,
she certainly won't tell.

546
00:23:48,666 --> 00:23:49,306
I guess

547
00:23:49,906 --> 00:23:51,786
she's going back to her old job.

548
00:23:53,026 --> 00:23:54,467
Why are you being melancholy?

549
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:56,266
I haven't started yet

550
00:23:56,386 --> 00:23:58,026
but you have knocked yourself down.

551
00:23:58,026 --> 00:23:58,707
Tou Tou!

552
00:23:59,827 --> 00:24:01,266
-Ms. Xia.
-Where is Prof. Ren?

553
00:24:01,906 --> 00:24:02,546
My master is inside there.

554
00:24:02,546 --> 00:24:04,026
Granny Mo Li is coughing up blood.

555
00:24:04,306 --> 00:24:04,827
Look.

556
00:24:07,066 --> 00:24:09,306
But my master is checking on a patient.

557
00:24:09,467 --> 00:24:10,947
Does she have other symptoms
besides coughing up blood?

558
00:24:10,947 --> 00:24:12,186
Did she take the medicine accordingly?

559
00:24:12,627 --> 00:24:14,467
I send her medicine over
on time every day.

560
00:24:14,467 --> 00:24:15,867
She took all without missing one.

561
00:24:15,867 --> 00:24:17,507
I also followed Prof. Ren's instructions

562
00:24:17,507 --> 00:24:18,627
by asking her to go to bed early
and get up early

563
00:24:18,627 --> 00:24:19,786
and pay attention to her diet.

564
00:24:19,786 --> 00:24:22,507
Her cough has improved
compared to before.

565
00:24:22,666 --> 00:24:25,627
But this morning,
Annie called me.

566
00:24:25,627 --> 00:24:27,266
She said her grandma threw up all night.

567
00:24:27,546 --> 00:24:29,386
When I went there just now,
she took the medicine too.

568
00:24:29,386 --> 00:24:31,066
But she vomited all the medicine

569
00:24:31,266 --> 00:24:32,146
and vomited blood.

570
00:24:32,467 --> 00:24:33,227
Have you checked her blood pressure?

571
00:24:33,227 --> 00:24:34,906
Besides coughing up blood,
is she not feeling well?

572
00:24:35,107 --> 00:24:36,507
Any dizziness?
Abdominal pain? Feeling cold?

573
00:24:36,507 --> 00:24:38,107
None of that. All are normal.

574
00:24:38,107 --> 00:24:39,386
Her blood pressure and all are normal.

575
00:24:40,386 --> 00:24:41,507
I'd better take her to the hospital.

576
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:43,266
Coughing up blood is not a good sign.

577
00:24:43,266 --> 00:24:43,747
Let's go.

578
00:24:44,426 --> 00:24:45,066
Ms. Xia!

579
00:24:46,146 --> 00:24:47,666
-Mr. Ren is here.
-Prof. Ren

580
00:24:47,666 --> 00:24:48,386
Did she cough up blood?

581
00:24:49,306 --> 00:24:50,426
It's alright, nothing to worry about.

582
00:24:50,426 --> 00:24:51,227
It's not a big problem.

583
00:24:51,747 --> 00:24:54,186
Her follow-up should be tomorrow, right?

584
00:24:54,186 --> 00:24:55,666
That's right, it's tomorrow.

585
00:24:55,786 --> 00:24:57,426
But she is vomiting blood.

586
00:24:57,947 --> 00:24:59,347
Anne is with her now.

587
00:24:59,707 --> 00:25:01,227
Mr. Ren, this should
probably, perhaps, maybe...

588
00:25:01,227 --> 00:25:03,066
It's better to go to the hospital
for a CT scan.

589
00:25:03,227 --> 00:25:04,426
I suggest sending her to the hospital.

590
00:25:04,867 --> 00:25:05,426
Ms. Xia.

591
00:25:05,666 --> 00:25:06,947
In your understanding,

592
00:25:06,947 --> 00:25:08,867
only Western medicine
is called a hospital.

593
00:25:09,227 --> 00:25:11,227
That signboard on my door

594
00:25:11,507 --> 00:25:12,867
was also issued by
the National Health Commission as well.

595
00:25:13,026 --> 00:25:15,066
I admit that
Chinese medicine is amazing.

596
00:25:15,066 --> 00:25:16,507
Chinese medicine is very effective

597
00:25:16,666 --> 00:25:17,906
on treating certain diseases,

598
00:25:17,906 --> 00:25:18,987
like my dad's frozen shoulder.

599
00:25:19,186 --> 00:25:20,467
But if we don't treat
the frozen shoulder,

600
00:25:20,467 --> 00:25:21,426
it will be fine after some time.

601
00:25:21,627 --> 00:25:22,627
But in Granny Mo Li's case,

602
00:25:22,627 --> 00:25:24,026
if there are
other underlying diseases...

603
00:25:24,026 --> 00:25:25,786
It'll be troublesome if
the pulmonary artery rupture, right?

604
00:25:25,786 --> 00:25:28,587
You're right.
Coughing up blood alone is scary enough.

605
00:25:28,786 --> 00:25:30,426
Annie cried badly.

606
00:25:30,827 --> 00:25:31,906
Don't worry.

607
00:25:31,906 --> 00:25:33,066
According to

608
00:25:33,386 --> 00:25:35,906
Bai Mo Li's current condition,

609
00:25:36,266 --> 00:25:39,227
coughing out blood is normal.

610
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:43,293
Discharge is also a natural phenomenon

611
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:44,467
of the body.

612
00:25:44,467 --> 00:25:46,386
It's just like
we vomit and have diarrhea

613
00:25:46,707 --> 00:25:48,107
after eating food that has gone bad.

614
00:25:49,146 --> 00:25:50,306
Never doubt

615
00:25:50,306 --> 00:25:52,786
the body's ability to resist this.

616
00:25:53,786 --> 00:25:55,987
If according to her current condition,

617
00:25:56,186 --> 00:25:57,026
by 1 a.m.,

618
00:25:57,666 --> 00:25:58,747
she should be fine.

619
00:25:58,747 --> 00:26:00,906
Well, go and inform her of this.

620
00:26:01,146 --> 00:26:01,747
Ask her

621
00:26:02,266 --> 00:26:03,707
to come back for a follow-up.

622
00:26:03,906 --> 00:26:04,347
Okay.

623
00:26:05,107 --> 00:26:06,587
Don't worry.

624
00:26:06,587 --> 00:26:07,467
Good news!

625
00:26:07,747 --> 00:26:08,347
Mr. Ren.

626
00:26:08,507 --> 00:26:09,066
Xiao Hong.

627
00:26:09,066 --> 00:26:09,906
Good news.

628
00:26:10,426 --> 00:26:11,426
I have found a place

629
00:26:11,426 --> 00:26:12,947
which can be rented to us for our class.

630
00:26:13,146 --> 00:26:14,386
Would you like to go and take a look?

631
00:26:14,707 --> 00:26:16,426
What? You're abetting the evil too?

632
00:26:17,026 --> 00:26:17,707
Where is it?

633
00:26:18,066 --> 00:26:19,987
It's right around here.
You can go anytime.

634
00:26:21,227 --> 00:26:22,867
I'll go now. I'll go get a change first.

635
00:26:22,867 --> 00:26:23,666
Prof. Ren.

636
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:25,306
You're not visiting Granny Mo Li?

637
00:26:25,306 --> 00:26:26,066
It's alright not to go.

638
00:26:26,546 --> 00:26:27,666
Trust him.

639
00:26:28,347 --> 00:26:29,467
I'll go and accompany her then.

640
00:26:31,026 --> 00:26:31,587
Ms. Xia!

641
00:26:31,827 --> 00:26:33,306
Wait for me. I'll go with you.

642
00:26:33,666 --> 00:26:34,186
Okay.

643
00:26:37,867 --> 00:26:38,507
Mr. Ren.

644
00:26:38,906 --> 00:26:41,906
I've checked almost
all the units around here.

645
00:26:42,066 --> 00:26:43,507
This is the most suitable one.

646
00:26:43,827 --> 00:26:45,627
First of all, it's big enough.

647
00:26:45,627 --> 00:26:46,947
We can have many students here.

648
00:26:46,947 --> 00:26:47,747
Do you know?

649
00:26:48,026 --> 00:26:50,107
Previously, it was an art gallery.

650
00:26:50,107 --> 00:26:52,587
They took off all the partitions,

651
00:26:52,587 --> 00:26:53,867
so, it's very spacious here.

652
00:26:54,066 --> 00:26:56,827
Ms. Dong can have
her technique class here.

653
00:26:57,546 --> 00:26:59,186
By the way, Mr. Ren, this place here.

654
00:26:59,747 --> 00:27:00,747
Come and have a look.

655
00:27:01,426 --> 00:27:03,266
There are several small rooms here.

656
00:27:03,707 --> 00:27:06,066
So, we can absolutely
have our consultations

657
00:27:06,066 --> 00:27:08,987
and acupuncture classes in these rooms.

658
00:27:08,987 --> 00:27:09,546
You're right.

659
00:27:11,026 --> 00:27:12,186
The most important thing is

660
00:27:12,186 --> 00:27:13,666
it's near the medical center.

661
00:27:13,666 --> 00:27:15,507
It's very convenient
for us to arrange courses.

662
00:27:15,786 --> 00:27:17,987
Also, students who walk to classes

663
00:27:17,987 --> 00:27:19,306
can go home and sleep.

664
00:27:19,306 --> 00:27:21,146
This can reduce
the burden of the apprentice class.

665
00:27:21,587 --> 00:27:22,867
The main thing is,

666
00:27:23,386 --> 00:27:25,146
when the landlord heard that
we are going to rent for a long time,

667
00:27:25,426 --> 00:27:27,587
he gave us a great deal.

668
00:27:27,947 --> 00:27:29,266
It definitely costs a lot of money.

669
00:27:29,906 --> 00:27:30,587
Not bad.

670
00:27:31,186 --> 00:27:33,587
The rental is
much cheaper than the market price.

671
00:27:34,906 --> 00:27:35,426
Really?

672
00:27:43,266 --> 00:27:44,786
This unit is really good.

673
00:27:45,426 --> 00:27:47,987
But the price can't go any lower.

674
00:27:48,107 --> 00:27:48,987
What should I do then?

675
00:27:49,546 --> 00:27:51,906
How about I show you
other units around this area?

676
00:27:51,906 --> 00:27:53,066
Is it the building over there?

677
00:27:53,066 --> 00:27:53,546
That's right.

678
00:27:53,827 --> 00:27:56,786
I think it fulfills
one of your requests.

679
00:27:56,906 --> 00:27:58,666
And in terms of unit price,

680
00:27:58,666 --> 00:28:00,507
its area is bigger.

681
00:28:12,666 --> 00:28:14,827
This is our lowest price.

682
00:28:15,107 --> 00:28:17,186
You can contact me anytime
if you need anything.

683
00:28:17,947 --> 00:28:19,947
Okay. Alright, I've got it. Thank you.

684
00:28:19,947 --> 00:28:20,947
-Okay. Bye.
-Bye.

685
00:28:40,507 --> 00:28:41,026
How is it?

686
00:28:41,266 --> 00:28:42,786
Is this place okay?

687
00:28:43,546 --> 00:28:44,146
Yes, it's okay.

688
00:28:44,867 --> 00:28:46,347
The unit is okay.

689
00:28:46,507 --> 00:28:47,107
Mr. Ma.

690
00:28:47,347 --> 00:28:49,587
Please give me
more discount on the price.

691
00:28:50,587 --> 00:28:51,186
Rebecca.

692
00:28:51,707 --> 00:28:54,107
You're very clear about my market price.

693
00:28:54,347 --> 00:28:55,666
I quoted the base price.

694
00:28:55,666 --> 00:28:57,467
Not to mention
you want to sign for five years.

695
00:28:57,467 --> 00:28:58,627
I didn't increase the rent.

696
00:28:58,627 --> 00:28:59,627
I've told you.

697
00:28:59,627 --> 00:29:00,786
If it's for my personal use,

698
00:29:00,987 --> 00:29:02,987
I won't bargain with you at all.

699
00:29:03,386 --> 00:29:05,467
But the apprentice class
is a charitable education.

700
00:29:05,467 --> 00:29:07,186
The lower the cost, the better.

701
00:29:08,186 --> 00:29:10,066
Well, everyone has an eye on this unit.

702
00:29:10,507 --> 00:29:11,386
I know.

703
00:29:11,627 --> 00:29:13,627
Otherwise, I wouldn't
have taken a liking at first glance.

704
00:29:14,107 --> 00:29:16,627
But this unit doesn't face the street

705
00:29:16,827 --> 00:29:18,906
and it's a distance away
from the subway stations.

706
00:29:19,066 --> 00:29:20,227
There are
many Internet-famous shops here.

707
00:29:20,227 --> 00:29:21,546
The market is already saturated.

708
00:29:21,546 --> 00:29:24,306
It's hard to find someone like me
who want to rent the whole building

709
00:29:24,306 --> 00:29:25,906
for a long time.

710
00:29:26,066 --> 00:29:27,947
And the cost is high
if you want to rent separately.

711
00:29:28,146 --> 00:29:29,467
The tenants
will come and go in a short period.

712
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:30,947
Not to mention
you are not familiar with them.

713
00:29:31,266 --> 00:29:33,666
I know everything,
that's my credibility.

714
00:29:33,666 --> 00:29:34,627
I won't run away.

715
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:36,867
Ms. Yang.

716
00:29:37,186 --> 00:29:38,546
You're using
your credibility to make a guarantee.

717
00:29:38,947 --> 00:29:41,266
What is it
that worth for you to do this?

718
00:29:42,627 --> 00:29:44,026
The future of an industry.

719
00:29:44,587 --> 00:29:45,627
Is this a venture capital?

720
00:29:46,186 --> 00:29:47,386
What benefits can I get from it?

721
00:29:47,627 --> 00:29:48,827
Can you give me some shares?

722
00:29:49,426 --> 00:29:51,347
It's a charity. There's no return.

723
00:29:51,347 --> 00:29:52,627
You can invest money and time,

724
00:29:52,747 --> 00:29:53,867
and get the shares you want.

725
00:29:58,546 --> 00:29:59,786
How about this, Mr. Ma?

726
00:30:00,786 --> 00:30:02,947
As long as I rent this place,

727
00:30:03,186 --> 00:30:05,306
I will provide
free legal services for you.

728
00:30:06,546 --> 00:30:07,587
You said this yourself.

729
00:30:08,066 --> 00:30:10,507
I can put this in the contract
as the additional term.

730
00:30:10,666 --> 00:30:11,666
An exclusive term.

731
00:30:13,227 --> 00:30:15,026
Alright, let's do that then.

732
00:30:15,467 --> 00:30:16,827
-This way, please.
-Okay. Thank you.

733
00:30:20,066 --> 00:30:21,587
You've worked hard.

734
00:30:22,867 --> 00:30:24,066
This is what I should do.

735
00:30:24,386 --> 00:30:25,827
Mainly it was my friend's help too.

736
00:30:26,146 --> 00:30:26,666
I see.

737
00:30:39,146 --> 00:30:39,827
I forgot about this.

738
00:30:40,426 --> 00:30:41,707
Your piggy bank...

739
00:30:42,426 --> 00:30:43,186
How much do you have?

740
00:30:44,026 --> 00:30:45,507
About half.

741
00:30:45,666 --> 00:30:46,666
When you go back later,

742
00:30:46,987 --> 00:30:48,026
you can remove everything.

743
00:30:50,587 --> 00:30:51,186
Xiao Hong.

744
00:30:52,146 --> 00:30:53,347
Having an apprentice like you

745
00:30:53,627 --> 00:30:54,546
makes me, your master,

746
00:30:54,947 --> 00:30:56,026
feel pleased.

747
00:30:56,786 --> 00:30:57,426
Thank you.

748
00:30:59,026 --> 00:30:59,627
Mr. Ren.

749
00:31:00,707 --> 00:31:01,587
But

750
00:31:01,867 --> 00:31:03,026
in my heart,

751
00:31:03,426 --> 00:31:04,707
I have chosen

752
00:31:04,707 --> 00:31:06,507
Ms. Dong as my master.

753
00:31:06,827 --> 00:31:07,507
That's because

754
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:10,107
I really want to inherit
the massage technique.

755
00:31:13,786 --> 00:31:14,507
That's good.

756
00:31:15,906 --> 00:31:17,467
Ms. Dong is good.

757
00:31:18,467 --> 00:31:21,306
Ms. Dong is a rare person.

758
00:31:23,066 --> 00:31:23,587
That's good.

759
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:27,306
By the way, Mr. Ren.

760
00:31:27,666 --> 00:31:28,987
Although the rental isn't expensive,

761
00:31:29,386 --> 00:31:31,786
the monthly expenses are quite high.

762
00:31:33,747 --> 00:31:34,266
Don't worry.

763
00:31:36,987 --> 00:31:37,666
I have money.

764
00:31:38,426 --> 00:31:39,026
Thank you.

765
00:32:11,306 --> 00:32:13,627
You're walking without a sound.
It's so scary!

766
00:32:15,146 --> 00:32:16,786
Do we have a big box at home?

767
00:32:18,107 --> 00:32:18,987
How big is it?

768
00:32:19,426 --> 00:32:20,666
A size that can fit a human.

769
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:24,186
Who are you going to put in there?

770
00:32:25,146 --> 00:32:27,386
A female apprentice found me a place.

771
00:32:27,867 --> 00:32:29,627
The apprentice class can start now.

772
00:32:30,426 --> 00:32:31,587
You must keep your promise.

773
00:32:32,107 --> 00:32:32,947
Pack me up

774
00:32:33,266 --> 00:32:34,227
and send it over.

775
00:32:38,066 --> 00:32:39,306
Let me interview you.

776
00:32:39,627 --> 00:32:41,747
Which female apprentice is so ignorant?

777
00:32:42,186 --> 00:32:43,186
Ms. Yang the lawyer.

778
00:32:45,867 --> 00:32:46,507
She?

779
00:32:48,827 --> 00:32:51,827
Have you told her
how much of a loser you are?

780
00:32:52,227 --> 00:32:53,306
Have you told her

781
00:32:53,386 --> 00:32:56,627
you won't spend a penny
on women in your life?

782
00:32:56,627 --> 00:32:57,747
Am I that stingy?

783
00:32:58,786 --> 00:32:59,266
You?

784
00:32:59,467 --> 00:33:00,867
She is rich.

785
00:33:01,666 --> 00:33:03,587
She won't give me a look.

786
00:33:05,186 --> 00:33:06,947
It's too early for you to dream.

787
00:33:08,227 --> 00:33:09,906
Are you still selling this house?

788
00:33:11,786 --> 00:33:12,507
Yes.

789
00:33:14,947 --> 00:33:16,107
Why?

790
00:33:17,786 --> 00:33:19,627
Someone will get you over.

791
00:33:19,947 --> 00:33:21,627
Why do you want to sell my dad's house?

792
00:33:21,867 --> 00:33:23,467
What? Sell the house?

793
00:33:23,827 --> 00:33:25,627
The unit

794
00:33:25,867 --> 00:33:27,146
that Yang Xiao Hong got for me

795
00:33:27,426 --> 00:33:28,306
is cheap

796
00:33:28,627 --> 00:33:29,587
and is in the city center.

797
00:33:29,587 --> 00:33:31,386
We have to pay the rent.

798
00:33:31,627 --> 00:33:33,627
Don't you think?

799
00:33:33,827 --> 00:33:35,987
I've called the property agent.

800
00:33:36,146 --> 00:33:39,227
He said not to worry about
that house in the community.

801
00:33:39,666 --> 00:33:41,347
I'll be able to give you the money soon.

802
00:33:41,467 --> 00:33:43,146
Besides that,
I've asked them to take note on

803
00:33:43,266 --> 00:33:45,827
a suitable house for rent.

804
00:33:46,426 --> 00:33:47,227
Don't worry.

805
00:33:47,627 --> 00:33:49,214
We two retirees

806
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,520
are free to take care

807
00:33:51,556 --> 00:33:52,720
and view the houses.

808
00:33:53,747 --> 00:33:54,467
Master.

809
00:33:54,666 --> 00:33:57,347
Ling Lan said our house...

810
00:33:57,347 --> 00:33:58,627
Our house is not for sale.

811
00:33:59,266 --> 00:34:00,867
I'm planning to clean it up

812
00:34:00,867 --> 00:34:02,066
and move back.

813
00:34:02,386 --> 00:34:04,507
Yes, it's small,
but we'll just squeeze in.

814
00:34:05,227 --> 00:34:06,867
It's just that Meng Meng and Tou Tou

815
00:34:06,867 --> 00:34:08,467
can't live with us.

816
00:34:08,827 --> 00:34:09,906
We really have no place.

817
00:34:10,107 --> 00:34:11,666
Let them go home.

818
00:34:11,827 --> 00:34:13,347
I'll stay in the dormitory.
Let them use my room.

819
00:34:13,707 --> 00:34:14,227
No.

820
00:34:14,546 --> 00:34:15,666
I can't stay in the school

821
00:34:15,666 --> 00:34:16,987
or Meng Meng can't stay here?

822
00:34:17,146 --> 00:34:17,947
Both.

823
00:34:19,947 --> 00:34:22,227
Tian Zhen must live here.

824
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:25,186
Otherwise, I won't have
a companion for a drink.

825
00:34:25,707 --> 00:34:27,467
Tou Tou doesn't have a family.

826
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:28,827
We can make a bed for her

827
00:34:28,827 --> 00:34:29,987
at the living hall.

828
00:34:30,467 --> 00:34:32,426
Meng Meng has family. She can go home.

829
00:34:32,426 --> 00:34:33,627
Grandpa, you...

830
00:34:35,786 --> 00:34:37,306
How many years can I live?

831
00:34:37,306 --> 00:34:39,347
Just be filial to me.

832
00:34:39,546 --> 00:34:40,467
Let's have a walk.

833
00:34:41,227 --> 00:34:41,666
That's not it.

834
00:35:24,066 --> 00:35:25,786
So, which house are we selling?

835
00:35:28,066 --> 00:35:29,306
It's not your house anyway.

836
00:35:29,467 --> 00:35:30,627
What are you worrying about?

837
00:35:30,906 --> 00:35:32,627
I'll just give you the money.

838
00:35:33,107 --> 00:35:35,507
Are you planning to sell our house?

839
00:35:36,026 --> 00:35:37,306
Use selling the house as an excuse

840
00:35:37,467 --> 00:35:38,467
and get Meng Meng out of here.

841
00:35:43,186 --> 00:35:45,346
Why don't you like Meng Meng?

842
00:35:57,027 --> 00:35:59,507
If she becomes
your future daughter-in-law...

843
00:36:00,547 --> 00:36:01,626
There is no "if".

844
00:36:04,906 --> 00:36:06,186
If that day does arrive,

845
00:36:06,947 --> 00:36:08,307
I'll sever my relationship with him.

846
00:36:08,987 --> 00:36:09,987
Out of sight, out of mind.

847
00:36:10,866 --> 00:36:12,507
Why are you so angry?

848
00:36:12,507 --> 00:36:14,307
Just learn to accept it.

849
00:36:14,947 --> 00:36:15,626
I can never learn.

850
00:36:16,146 --> 00:36:16,906
And I don't want to learn.

851
00:36:19,626 --> 00:36:21,267
Do you want to lose the son

852
00:36:21,947 --> 00:36:23,067
and the husband?

853
00:36:30,707 --> 00:36:31,707
What do you mean?

854
00:36:32,307 --> 00:36:33,787
Nothing.

855
00:36:34,586 --> 00:36:37,586
Are you planning to move to
Yang Xiao Hong's place tonight?

856
00:36:38,067 --> 00:36:38,987
-What?
-Don't go!

857
00:36:43,186 --> 00:36:44,307
So, you're jealous.

858
00:36:47,267 --> 00:36:48,267
Me?

859
00:36:48,866 --> 00:36:50,586
Why should I be jealous?

860
00:36:51,106 --> 00:36:52,987
I want to get back

861
00:36:53,307 --> 00:36:56,186
all the money, not a penny less,

862
00:36:56,186 --> 00:36:58,106
that I had spent
on the first half of your life

863
00:36:58,467 --> 00:36:59,826
from Yang Xiao Hong.

864
00:37:05,346 --> 00:37:06,707
Jealous?

865
00:37:32,666 --> 00:37:33,227
Well...

866
00:37:33,906 --> 00:37:34,987
Why

867
00:37:35,307 --> 00:37:36,586
did you come?

868
00:37:36,826 --> 00:37:37,826
Where is her granddaughter?

869
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:43,067
He didn't leave since yesterday.

870
00:37:43,906 --> 00:37:46,067
He asked for a room next to mine

871
00:37:46,707 --> 00:37:47,626
and put a night there.

872
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:50,227
He was afraid that
something would happen to me.

873
00:37:50,586 --> 00:37:51,267
My granddaughter

874
00:37:51,467 --> 00:37:52,826
did not sleep all night.

875
00:37:52,826 --> 00:37:54,067
She just went to sleep.

876
00:37:54,426 --> 00:37:56,826
That's why Dr. Peng came with me.

877
00:37:59,826 --> 00:38:00,666
I see.

878
00:38:01,747 --> 00:38:02,866
Don't think nonsense.

879
00:38:02,866 --> 00:38:04,826
I took the duty on
your dad's behalf. I respect him.

880
00:38:04,826 --> 00:38:05,866
Are you still coughing today?

881
00:38:06,467 --> 00:38:07,547
It has suddenly stopped coughing.

882
00:38:08,186 --> 00:38:09,346
-You've stopped coughing?
-That's right.

883
00:38:09,586 --> 00:38:11,586
-You've stopped coughing?
-That's right.

884
00:38:11,586 --> 00:38:13,027
Let's go. I'll check for you.

885
00:38:13,626 --> 00:38:14,106
Come.

886
00:38:16,547 --> 00:38:17,586
-You...
-What?

887
00:38:24,386 --> 00:38:26,027
How was your sleep last night?

888
00:38:26,386 --> 00:38:27,227
Very good.

889
00:38:27,586 --> 00:38:29,787
In fact, I have been sleeping well

890
00:38:29,787 --> 00:38:31,386
since taking Chinese medicine.

891
00:38:50,547 --> 00:38:51,146
I don't understand.

892
00:38:52,386 --> 00:38:53,826
You'll understand
if you do it frequently.

893
00:38:55,106 --> 00:38:56,507
You do have good sleep.

894
00:38:57,307 --> 00:38:57,947
Yes.

895
00:38:58,307 --> 00:39:00,346
Your pulse is much better than before.

896
00:39:05,186 --> 00:39:07,947
You know, the Chinese characters
are very interesting.

897
00:39:07,947 --> 00:39:09,666
I said, "shui jiao" (sleep).

898
00:39:10,027 --> 00:39:11,346
The character "jiao"

899
00:39:11,666 --> 00:39:13,267
can be pronounced as "jue",

900
00:39:13,547 --> 00:39:15,067
as in "jue cha" (awareness).

901
00:39:15,307 --> 00:39:16,866
When have you good sleep,

902
00:39:16,866 --> 00:39:18,910
the various functions of your body

903
00:39:18,935 --> 00:39:20,106
will have their awareness.

904
00:39:20,826 --> 00:39:22,987
When your body is not feeling well,

905
00:39:23,426 --> 00:39:26,547
it will adjust itself.

906
00:39:28,747 --> 00:39:29,507
Remember this.

907
00:39:29,947 --> 00:39:33,146
If a person can do three things well,

908
00:39:34,067 --> 00:39:35,747
that means he should have good health.

909
00:39:36,467 --> 00:39:37,146
Which three things?

910
00:39:38,146 --> 00:39:38,866
Eat well,

911
00:39:39,467 --> 00:39:40,146
sleep well,

912
00:39:40,626 --> 00:39:41,227
and excrete well.

913
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:46,067
There are many reasons for
people to get sick, not just three.

914
00:39:46,386 --> 00:39:48,146
Let's say, flu.

915
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:49,707
What does it have to do
with these three things?

916
00:39:50,586 --> 00:39:55,106
Well, why some people could
get infected while the others couldn't?

917
00:39:55,866 --> 00:39:56,826
That's because

918
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:59,906
of your physical immunity.

919
00:40:01,346 --> 00:40:02,987
What is physical immunity?

920
00:40:02,987 --> 00:40:04,186
That is to say, it should be in order.

921
00:40:06,227 --> 00:40:08,067
If your body functions are in order.

922
00:40:08,426 --> 00:40:11,906
the virus won't take advantage of it.

923
00:40:12,227 --> 00:40:14,346
It's just like
charging our mobile phones.

924
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:16,067
Charging is sleeping.

925
00:40:16,987 --> 00:40:19,747
It will function as normal
if there're apps.

926
00:40:20,267 --> 00:40:21,307
But

927
00:40:21,906 --> 00:40:23,866
there must be space in the phone.

928
00:40:23,866 --> 00:40:25,346
If there is no space,

929
00:40:25,747 --> 00:40:27,866
that mobile phone is useless.

930
00:40:29,186 --> 00:40:29,866
Understood.

931
00:40:30,267 --> 00:40:31,586
So, to "excrete" means

932
00:40:31,586 --> 00:40:33,186
it is necessary
to clean the memory frequently.

933
00:40:34,586 --> 00:40:36,987
In fact, I often tell my students that

934
00:40:37,787 --> 00:40:39,027
everything

935
00:40:39,267 --> 00:40:42,106
should follow the rules.

936
00:40:42,547 --> 00:40:43,626
If you have found the rules,

937
00:40:43,906 --> 00:40:45,426
you'd naturally find the solution.

938
00:40:45,787 --> 00:40:48,507
If it is proper, it will run on its own.

939
00:40:48,826 --> 00:40:51,146
If it's not proper,
it should be eliminated.

940
00:40:52,426 --> 00:40:54,067
No wonder TCM practitioners always say

941
00:40:54,067 --> 00:40:55,426
there should be harmony
between heaven, earth, and man.

942
00:40:55,747 --> 00:40:58,067
I thought it meant that humans should be
in harmony with heaven and earth.

943
00:40:59,507 --> 00:41:00,747
If a person's
body functions are in order,

944
00:41:01,426 --> 00:41:02,426
then he can

945
00:41:02,426 --> 00:41:03,947
be in harmony with heaven and earth.

946
00:41:05,426 --> 00:41:06,186
By the way, Mr. Ren,

947
00:41:06,787 --> 00:41:08,027
there is another thing
that I'm curious about.

948
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:09,386
How do you know

949
00:41:09,866 --> 00:41:11,426
that she will stop coughing at 1 a.m.?

950
00:41:12,146 --> 00:41:13,106
It's written in the book.

951
00:41:13,386 --> 00:41:14,666
Book? Which book?

952
00:41:14,987 --> 00:41:15,507
Look at you.

953
00:41:16,626 --> 00:41:18,346
You didn't study well.

954
00:41:18,346 --> 00:41:18,906
Tou Tou.

955
00:41:19,707 --> 00:41:20,467
You tell him.

956
00:41:24,067 --> 00:41:24,666
"Taiyin disease."

957
00:41:24,666 --> 00:41:26,507
"The disease could be
lifted from 11 p.m. to 3 a.m."

958
00:41:26,507 --> 00:41:28,227
"Article No. 275,
Treatise on Febrile Diseases."

959
00:41:32,467 --> 00:41:34,666
Amazing! I didn't see it coming.

960
00:41:36,027 --> 00:41:38,186
I just knew that

961
00:41:38,186 --> 00:41:40,307
he would definitely test me today.

962
00:41:41,346 --> 00:41:43,507
So, I went to memorize it
the night before.

963
00:41:44,906 --> 00:41:46,106
You're great.

964
00:41:47,547 --> 00:41:49,626
You're the roundworm in my stomach then.

965
00:41:52,106 --> 00:41:52,747
Amazing.

966
00:41:53,386 --> 00:41:55,707
Books from more than
2,000 years ago still works today.

967
00:41:56,227 --> 00:41:57,027
It's unbelievable.

968
00:41:59,626 --> 00:42:00,787
Mdm. Bai Mo Li.

969
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:02,826
I'm going to change
a prescription for you.

970
00:42:03,547 --> 00:42:04,507
Am I going to be recovered?

971
00:42:08,146 --> 00:42:09,027
Take it easy.

972
00:42:09,906 --> 00:42:10,826
Look.

973
00:42:10,826 --> 00:42:12,626
That's why I said
Chinese medicine is a slow doctor.

974
00:42:14,307 --> 00:42:15,987
I don't like listening to you.

975
00:42:15,987 --> 00:42:17,386
No one likes to listen to him.

976
00:42:17,386 --> 00:42:17,866
Get out!

977
00:42:18,067 --> 00:42:18,906
Get out!

978
00:42:18,906 --> 00:42:20,307
I just want to liven up the atmosphere.

979
00:42:22,307 --> 00:42:23,227
Look, these are students.

980
00:42:35,526 --> 00:42:37,155
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

981
00:42:37,181 --> 00:42:38,700
(are referenced from relevant
traditional Chinese medicine books)

982
00:42:38,725 --> 00:42:40,041
