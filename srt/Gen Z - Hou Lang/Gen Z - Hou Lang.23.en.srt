1
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,800
I want to try again.

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:06,960
So, I

3
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,960
flew halfway around the world
to come and look for you.

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,960
How do you know me?

5
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:19,880
I read the article you wrote,

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,120
"Understanding of TCM".

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,240
In the article,

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,360
there was a patient about my age

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,920
and had lung disease.

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,800
You cured him.

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,720
So, I came to you.

12
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,520
Mdm. Bairie.

13
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:34,720
My surname is Bai.

14
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,520
My name is Jasmine.

15
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,800
You can just call me Mo Li.

16
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,760
Mo Li?

17
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,640
Yes, Mo Li.

18
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,600
Bai Mo Li.

19
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:45,960
Bai Mo Li.

20
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,520
What a beautiful name.

21
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,440
Thank you.

22
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,360
Well, it's like this.

23
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,800
The treatment for Chinese medicine,

24
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,677
although the disease
shares the same name,

25
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,917
in Western medicine,

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,840
the doctor will
check the patient's weight

27
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,200
and other indexes

28
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,526
before prescribing medication for you.

29
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,806
But in Chinese medicine,

30
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,720
though it's the same disease,
the lung disease,

31
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,760
the symptoms are different.

32
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,360
My prescription

33
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,880
will also be different.

34
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,200
I trust you more with what you said.

35
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,960
Each of us in this world is

36
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,040
unique.

37
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,840
You're right.

38
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,960
Tell me then.

39
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,120
Besides coughing,

40
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,800
do you feel not well?

41
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,800
No, nothing else.

42
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,120
But I'm just tired.

43
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,880
-Tired?
-Yes, tired.

44
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,640
Tiredness is also a disease.

45
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,560
Hi, front desk.

46
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,920
Please ask Tou Tou to come over.

47
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,000
-Well, guys!
-Keep your voice down!

48
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,040
Guys.

49
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,917
If you want me dead,
please let me know the reason.

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,760
What unforgivable matter have I done?

51
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,837
Where did this thing come from? Tell us!

52
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,360
-From my dad.
-From your dad?

53
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,600
Liu Zi Hong.

54
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,160
We don't have time to play with you.

55
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,720
Be honest with us!

56
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,000
It's from my dad, really.
I didn't lie to you.

57
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,800
What?

58
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,400
Isn't this good stuff?

59
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,240
I don't know about it, but
my dad treats it as a precious item.

60
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,760
Good.

61
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,240
Very good.

62
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,160
It is good stuff.

63
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,600
Look.

64
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,440
I've told you, it's a good stuff.

65
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,957
My dad brought it back
in the middle of the night

66
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,197
and secretly hide it.

67
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,360
This thing must be precious.

68
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,280
If I hadn't taken it on his way,

69
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,360
this thing would have gotten
into his safe.

70
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,560
Tell us then.

71
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,800
Why did you bring this to me?

72
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,680
Listen.

73
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,120
This old saying is good.

74
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,717
"Though it was
a minor favor from others,

75
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,160
we should reciprocate with huge favor."

76
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,320
At that time,

77
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,440
you helped me

78
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,720
and my dad agreed
to let me continue to be a trainee.

79
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,640
So, I must do something to repay you.

80
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,360
Besides,

81
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,637
you're now my number-one fan.

82
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,880
As the idol,

83
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,840
it's normal to give you some benefits.

84
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,240
You know my relationship with my dad.

85
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,440
I just wanted to make him feel bad.

86
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,120
He said it could save lives.

87
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,797
I was thinking his friends
whom he always has drinks with

88
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,040
aren't those who cherish lives.

89
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,040
Since this is good stuff,

90
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,200
it must be better to give you this

91
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,120
rather than he keeps it.

92
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,480
You've ruined
your dad's important matter.

93
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,640
You've ruined our important matter too.

94
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,520
This thing

95
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,280
can really save lives.

96
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,360
It's to save
the "life" of our apprentice class.

97
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,160
It's to save our lives!

98
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,600
You did something bad, do you know that?

99
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,280
What do you mean?

100
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,320
Don't exaggerate it.

101
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,960
I didn't mean it.

102
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,517
It's too late to say anything now.

103
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,960
Your dad's orchard has been mortgaged.

104
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,600
And we don't have a place
to run the apprentice class.

105
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,077
Even if you have ten wild ginseng now,

106
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,080
it won't help anything at all.

107
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,080
Brother.

108
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,160
Listen to my advice.

109
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,120
Don't be an idol.

110
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,560
Okay? Don't be an idol.

111
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,320
You've got no brain for this.

112
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,720
You're not able to do this.

113
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:29,960
You won't become popular!

114
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,560
Do you understand?

115
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,080
Tou Tou, Mr. Ren is looking for you.

116
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,440
Coming.

117
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,960
Is it so hard to do something good?

118
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,400
Consultation is the most important part
in Chinese medicine.

119
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,120
Tou Tou, remember this.

120
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,520
What should we ask?

121
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,640
First, ask about cold and hot.
Second, ask about sweating.

122
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,320
Third, ask about the head and body.
Fourth, ask about stool.

123
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,920
Five, ask about diet.
Six, ask about the chest.

124
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:29,040
Seven, ask about hearing.
Eight, distinguish the thirstiness.

125
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:33,557
Nine, check for the Yin and Yang.

126
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,440
That's incorrect.

127
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,080
It should be,
"Nine, ask about old diseases."

128
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,080
Ten, ask about causes.

129
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,960
You got it wrong.

130
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,000
You didn't know that
I know about it, right?

131
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,280
What is the eye in Chinese medicine?

132
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,440
Before we talk about
the first aid of Chinese medicine,

133
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,800
let me ask you this.

134
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,160
In Chinese medicine,
what is the eye of a human?

135
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,480
Yin and yang.

136
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,480
Yes, you've gotten in right.

137
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:07,880
Yin and yang.

138
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,240
The eyes in Chinese medicine...

139
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,080
To check for yin and yang.

140
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,600
How could I be wrong
if it can check for yin and yang?

141
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,200
You can speak Mandarin well.

142
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,440
You can understand our conversation.

143
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,197
It's not easy to lead students now.

144
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,240
She even picks on her teacher's fault.

145
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,240
No, I didn't.

146
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,120
You remind me of

147
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,760
my piano teacher when I was young.

148
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,840
Because of her, I became

149
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,800
a teacher.

150
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,520
Madam.

151
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,797
Why did you come to pick him up today?

152
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,720
Where is Le Le's mother?

153
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,000
Le Le.

154
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,400
Tell Ms. Zhang.

155
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,280
You're going to Grandma's house
during the weekend, right?

156
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,480
Right?

157
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,766
Ms. Zhang.

158
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:13,326
Grandma's house has a big car

159
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:16,196
and a robot taller than me.

160
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,237
That's good.

161
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,957
Did you tell your mom

162
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,237
that you're going to
Grandma's house and play today?

163
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,160
Ms. Zhang.

164
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,480
About Le Le

165
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,840
going home with me,

166
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,677
Cheng Ying knows about it.

167
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,000
Don't worry.

168
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,760
Le Le, say goodbye to Ms. Zhang.

169
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,160
Let's go home.

170
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,146
-Goodbye, teacher.
-I'm sorry.

171
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,880
Ms. Zhang, I'm late
as there are traffics on the road.

172
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,640
Le Le.

173
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,640
What did I tell you this morning?

174
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,080
In the future, after class ends,

175
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,000
you can only wait for me to pick you up.

176
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,240
You can't leave with strangers.

177
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,520
Do you remember?

178
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,480
Cheng Ying.

179
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,920
What do you mean by that?

180
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,717
Le Le is my grandson. I'm his grandma.

181
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,160
Why did I become a stranger?

182
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,680
I don't mean anything.

183
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,313
He is young.
His safety awareness is weak.

184
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,597
I must remind him repeatedly.

185
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,600
His grandma picks him up today

186
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,000
and his dad picks him up tomorrow.

187
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,837
Someday, a strange aunt

188
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,877
can pick up my son too.

189
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,760
That would be bad.

190
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,800
You have a
new granddaughter now, aren't you?

191
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,400
It that's the case, you don't

192
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,557
have to bother about
Le Le's matter anymore.

193
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,440
Let's go.

194
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,600
What are you doing?

195
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,040
He's spending the weekend
with his dad every fortnight.

196
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,200
Put Le Le down.

197
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,440
I told you very clearly on that day.

198
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,000
In future, Le Le has nothing
to do with you anymore.

199
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,200
Let's go.

200
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,640
-What are you doing?
-Nothing to do with us?

201
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,440
How could he have nothing to do with us?

202
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,040
Yes,
you have nothing to do with us.

203
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,917
But Le Le is my eldest grandson!

204
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,117
The court ruled that

205
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,077
he spends time
with his dad every fortnight.

206
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,360
Do you think you can overrule this
by just telling me?

207
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,840
You're joking!

208
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,077
Let me tell you then.

209
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,120
I will go to court and appeal.

210
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,040
In the future,

211
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,277
my son has nothing to do with you!

212
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,077
He is my son, not your grandson!

213
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,237
Put Le Le down!

214
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,200
What are you doing?

215
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,600
I'll prescribe some medicine for you

216
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,360
to regulate your body.

217
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,280
Prof. Ren.

218
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,280
Can my illness really be cured?

219
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,480
Let's try.

220
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,040
You took a lot of antibiotics.

221
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,320
Antibiotics

222
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,706
are very good medicine.

223
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:35,957
If you take antibiotics,

224
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,440
it can treat your illness
and it is life-saving.

225
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,960
But if you consume it for a long time,

226
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,680
your immunity

227
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,360
will become weak.

228
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,800
Take a few doses of this medicine

229
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,957
to regulate your body functions

230
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,680
so that it can go back to normal.

231
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,200
Preserve your yang energy.

232
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:54,880
You're going to war now.

233
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,880
Take care of your body first

234
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,640
so that you can fight.

235
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,040
Okay.

236
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,800
Where are you staying?

237
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,480
Hyatt Hotel.

238
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,560
Hyatt?

239
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:12,920
That's right.

240
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,560
This hotel is quite expensive.

241
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,760
Your illness

242
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,237
cannot be cured in a day or two.

243
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,640
I suggest you change the hotel.

244
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,680
Move closer to the medical center.

245
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,760
By doing that,

246
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,920
you can save a lot of expenses.

247
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:33,920
Okay.

248
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,080
I'll listen to you.

249
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,000
As for your diet,

250
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,240
avoid fruits for now.

251
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,520
Don't eat chilled food, okay?

252
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:43,920
Okay.

253
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,240
Who is with you now?

254
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,400
My granddaughter will come

255
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,880
after two days.

256
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,280
Don't worry.

257
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,960
Someone from the medical center
will keep in touch with you

258
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,293
until your granddaughter arrives, okay?

259
00:10:57,377 --> 00:10:58,158
Okay.

260
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,757
With that, you can rest assured

261
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,840
and I'll be at ease too.

262
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,160
Okay.

263
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,720
Tou Tou.

264
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:04,960
Inform Zhu Xia

265
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,520
to keep in touch with Bai Mo Li.

266
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:08,960
Okay.

267
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,317
You must be persistence

268
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,437
in taking the medicine I prescribe you.

269
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,080
Regulate your body first.

270
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,520
Okay.

271
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,400
I'll work hard.

272
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,080
I'll work hard also.

273
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,560
I'll work hard too.

274
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,960
I will work hard too

275
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,680
These

276
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,600
are some precautions and avoidance
of food during the medication.

277
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:38,920
Can you see it?

278
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,480
Have a look when you go back.

279
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,560
Okay.

280
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,480
Also, this one.

281
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,880
It's for foot soaking.

282
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,317
I've packed it for you.

283
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,200
Let me take a look.

284
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,797
You may not have a foot bath pail,
so I got you one.

285
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,600
A new foot bath pail. This one.

286
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,240
-Thank you.
-It's a new one.

287
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,880
-Thanks.
-Just put it in and soak your feet.

288
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,480
My master has told you.

289
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,720
You need to get more sunlight.

290
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,640
Getting more sunlight
is good for health.

291
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,080
-Okay?
-Okay.

292
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,760
You came all the way here
to treat your illness.

293
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,080
Just receive the treatment
at ease and with a piece of mind.

294
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,480
If my master
said the illness can be cured,

295
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,880
there surely be no problem.

296
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,400
All of us need to work hard.

297
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,200
Alright, let me keep it.

298
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,360
I know he's great.

299
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,197
I trust my instincts and choices.

300
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,680
I have been sick
for more than three years.

301
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,040
I'm not afraid

302
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,877
of using another three years

303
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,480
to fight off the illness
with the doctor.

304
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,837
Fight off the illness!

305
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,720
Tou Tou.

306
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,720
Is she Mdm. Bai that
Prof. Ren wanted me to take care of?

307
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,720
Ms. Xia, this is Granny Mo Li.

308
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,680
Hello.

309
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,120
Ms. Xia.

310
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,877
If there is any problem or any requests,

311
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,480
you can just look for her.

312
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,360
Okay.

313
00:12:49,441 --> 00:12:50,940
I'll go and check
if the medicine is ready.

314
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:51,840
Okay.

315
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,466
Okay. Sorry for troubling you.

316
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,440
Don't be so polite. No trouble at all.

317
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,557
I am also
a family member of the patient.

318
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,077
I know very well what patients need.

319
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,237
I will definitely take good care of you

320
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,360
until your granddaughter arrives.

321
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,757
Thank you.

322
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,880
You're welcome.

323
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,240
You are the kid's grandma?

324
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,800
Biological grandma?

325
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,200
And you are the kid's mother?

326
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,560
That's right.

327
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:24,920
Biological mother?

328
00:13:25,353 --> 00:13:26,278
Certainly.

329
00:13:26,361 --> 00:13:27,597
Mr. Police.

330
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,157
You're finally here. Let me tell you.

331
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,157
You must call the shots for me.

332
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,397
-Okay, okay.
-Let me tell you.

333
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,357
This woman didn't allow me
to take my grandson with me.

334
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,117
She even hit me!

335
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,920
You wanted to take my son away
without my permission.

336
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,520
Of course,
I won't let you take him away!

337
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,880
When I divorced, I got the custody.

338
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,397
The court ruled that

339
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,720
my eldest grandson will spend

340
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,997
his weekend with his dad
every fortnight!

341
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,160
It's different now.

342
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,080
Since you lied to me last time,

343
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,917
in the future, I will never allow my son

344
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,240
to simply go to a stranger's house!

345
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,320
I'm going through
the legal process again.

346
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,680
Okay.

347
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,126
You want a new trial, don't you?

348
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:02,117
Okay!

349
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,757
I want to get back the custody
of my grandson!

350
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,640
Let me tell you.

351
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,477
Le Le's custody was awarded to you

352
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,997
because we pitied you for being a woman

353
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,717
and Le Le's dad couldn't afford it.

354
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,117
Look at your
unreasonable mouth and look now,

355
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,197
let's meet in court!

356
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,957
-What do you mean?
-What do I mean?

357
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,600
-Madam, stop talking.
-No wonder my son looks down on you.

358
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,037
You're emotionally unstable.

359
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,240
If Le Le sees you,
he will look down on you.

360
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,720
You're talking nonsense!

361
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,037
-You...
-Calm down.

362
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,117
Who is emotionally unstable?

363
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,717
I took the video. Did you see it?
Do you hear what she says?

364
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,440
-Madam.
-Your son who cheated on me!

365
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,797
That's the good son you taught!

366
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,680
Madam.

367
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,637
Madam, calm down.

368
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,837
Calm down!

369
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,520
Put down your phone!

370
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,640
Madam, calm down!

371
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,997
Do you still want the keep the kid?

372
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,120
You're weak.

373
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,400
Ms. Cheng.

374
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,640
Do you want me
to take the kid away first?

375
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,480
She wants to fight with me?

376
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,426
Stop talking!

377
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:56,597
I'm sorry.

378
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,677
Can I be rest assured
if the kid is with her?

379
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,080
I've scared you.

380
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,800
I promise I will never do it again.

381
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,720
No one can take you away from me.

382
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,080
I will never let you leave me.

383
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:09,960
Madam.

384
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,080
Given the current situation,

385
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,080
this week,

386
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,160
let the grandma bring the kid back.

387
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:19,840
No!

388
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,520
First.

389
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,960
You cannot reject
the father who has his right

390
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,440
to visit his son.

391
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,400
And,

392
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,680
your current emotion isn't suitable
to be alone with the kid.

393
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,000
What's wrong with me now?

394
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,357
What's wrong with me?

395
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,997
Why can't I

396
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,677
stay with my own kid?

397
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,997
-Calm down.
-Madam, get up first.

398
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,880
Le Le, don't go!

399
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,920
Le Le!

400
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,800
Madam.

401
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,517
If you really want to have your son,

402
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,000
you must control your emotions.

403
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,080
Never let
this kind of thing happens again.

404
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,000
Where did you take my son to?

405
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,600
-Ms. Xia.
-What's the matter with you?

406
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,160
What happened to you?

407
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,960
Didn't you go and pick Le Le up?

408
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:21,960
I...

409
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,600
I can't live anymore!

410
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,077
Speak slowly.

411
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,240
It's okay, don't cry.

412
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,560
Don't cry.

413
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,520
Prof. Ren.

414
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,400
You know,
I think my illness can't be cured.

415
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,797
I followed the methods you taught me
to control my emotion.

416
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,160
I have controlled it.

417
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,920
But why do all of them
keep pushing me hard?

418
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,520
Why did you say so?

419
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,000
They're too much!

420
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,240
They always push their luck!

421
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,720
My ex-mother-in-law

422
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,400
is going to fight for my kid now.

423
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,280
If she takes my son away,

424
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,120
I'll have nothing.

425
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,800
But I also thought about it.

426
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,880
If someone dares to take my son away,

427
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,720
I will die with them.

428
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,360
You won't die with them.

429
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,680
You're recovered, really.

430
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,960
You're going to be reborn.

431
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:26,960
Prof. Ren.

432
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,677
I'm so mad at them

433
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,957
yet you still make fun of me.

434
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,240
I'm not making fun of you.

435
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,757
Remember when you first came?

436
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,520
You were very weak, weren't you?

437
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,000
This time, you have hatred in you.

438
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,040
And you're full of energy.

439
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,320
Cheng Ying.

440
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,440
Emotion

441
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,040
is something each of us

442
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,800
that we have to face for a lifetime.

443
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,240
It's not something that can be realized

444
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,320
or enlightened

445
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,720
after just one class.

446
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,200
If that was the case,

447
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,240
you would immediately
become a Buddha.

448
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,880
You and I are mortal.

449
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,400
We can't make something
happen just by wanting to do it.

450
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,280
Emotion

451
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,440
isn't for you to bear with it

452
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,880
or control it.

453
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,320
That's not healthy.

454
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,880
It hurts you, actually.

455
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,680
If you're emotional

456
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,960
and you can resolve it,

457
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,720
you're being fair,

458
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,280
as in being fair and upright.

459
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,800
What if you can't solve it?

460
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,400
Well, just let it

461
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,200
gently release,

462
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,920
not explode in anger.

463
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,120
Isn't that one of the ways?

464
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,520
Being fair and upright,
gentle and moderate.

465
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,920
If you can do

466
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,760
any of these,

467
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,560
you are healthy.

468
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,000
Come.

469
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,560
Let me check your pulse.

470
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,400
Well, can my illness

471
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,320
be cured?

472
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,120
You must reconcile with yourself.

473
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,240
Then you'll be fine.

474
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,800
How do reconcile with myself?

475
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,800
Look.

476
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,960
Humans can control very little things.

477
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,080
You can't

478
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,400
control what others
think of you or say about you.

479
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,240
What should you do then?

480
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,160
Treat yourself better.

481
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,320
I don't know how to treat myself better.

482
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,800
Look, if you're happy,
would you still care about

483
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,480
your previous unhappiness?

484
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,120
It's just like
if you have one million now,

485
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:49,160
would you still care about
10 or 20 yuan you've lost?

486
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,120
Remember this.

487
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,160
You must put yourself down.

488
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,517
You hate your ex-husband

489
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,960
and blame your mother-in-law.

490
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,480
That's like using a knife on your chest.

491
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,320
What kind of relationship

492
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,197
would make you use

493
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,200
self-harm to commemorate it?

494
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,200
If you do this,

495
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,440
you'll only hurt the one who loves you.

496
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,560
For example, your son.

497
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,520
It doesn't work at all on others.

498
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,360
Put yourself down.

499
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,600
That's very important.

500
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,080
Alright.

501
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,080
Don't cry.

502
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,480
Go back now.

503
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,560
I should get off work too.

504
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,880
You haven't prescribed me medicine yet.

505
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,640
I checked your pulse just now.

506
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,680
It's very stable.

507
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,880
The medicine was just a cover-up.

508
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,720
Well, give me some

509
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,240
cover-up medicine.

510
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,720
The method you mentioned just now,

511
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,320
I need to digest it.

512
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,240
Peng Shi Yan.

513
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,237
It's a day off

514
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,960
but I was called over to do hard work.

515
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:27,960
Mr. Ren.

516
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,560
Today's dinner and supper

517
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,080
are on you.

518
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,317
Don't blame me.

519
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,437
You are also a member
of the apprentice class.

520
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,440
This is what you should do.

521
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,280
That's right.

522
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,077
He is the class leader
yet has no sense of responsibility.

523
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,840
He only knows complaining.

524
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:41,880
That's right.

525
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,160
Since when are you two so united?

526
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,480
But our apprentice class
is in a poor state now, isn't it?

527
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,837
Quan applied for a day off today.

528
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,797
I guessed he went
to do a part-time job, right?

529
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,160
Why didn't I see Ms. Yang the lawyer?

530
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,160
I saw Ms. Dong is here.

531
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,600
Didn't she praise herself that
she's Ms. Dong's favorite student?

532
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,600
I didn't expect her
to be absent from Ms. Dong's class.

533
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,957
Roubecca has been acting mysterious

534
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,120
for several days.

535
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,397
She would disappear for a few hours.

536
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,080
I don't know where she went.

537
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,280
If you ask her,
she certainly won't tell.

538
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,400
I guess

539
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,720
she's going back to her old job.

540
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,400
Why are you being melancholy?

541
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,200
I haven't started yet

542
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,877
but you have knocked yourself down.

543
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,760
Tou Tou!

544
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,200
-Ms. Xia.
-Where is Prof. Ren?

545
00:22:26,362 --> 00:22:27,436
My master is inside there.

546
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,999
Granny Mo Li is coughing up blood.

547
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,040
Look.

548
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,240
But my master is checking on a patient.

549
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,797
Does she have other symptoms
besides coughing up blood?

550
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,120
Did she take the medicine accordingly?

551
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,317
I send her medicine over
on time every day.

552
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,717
She took all without missing one.

553
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,357
I also followed Prof. Ren's instructions

554
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,477
by asking her to go to bed early
and get up early

555
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,637
and pay attention to her diet.

556
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,440
Her cough has improved
compared to before.

557
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,477
But this morning,
Annie called me.

558
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,200
She said her grandma threw up all night.

559
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,237
When I went there just now,
she took the medicine too.

560
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,000
But she vomited all the medicine

561
00:22:56,084 --> 00:22:57,098
and vomited blood.

562
00:22:57,182 --> 00:22:58,078
Have you checked her blood pressure?

563
00:22:58,161 --> 00:22:59,840
Besides coughing up blood,
is she not feeling well?

564
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,357
Any dizziness?
Abdominal pain? Feeling cold?

565
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,957
None of that. All are normal.

566
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,320
Her blood pressure and all are normal.

567
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,440
I'd better take her to the hospital.

568
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,117
Coughing up blood is not a good sign.

569
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,000
Let's go.

570
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,160
Ms. Xia!

571
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,517
-Mr. Ren is here.
-Prof. Ren

572
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,400
Did she cough up blood?

573
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,277
It's alright, nothing to worry about.

574
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,160
It's not a big problem.

575
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,037
Her follow-up should be tomorrow, right?

576
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,600
That's right, it's tomorrow.

577
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,360
But she is vomiting blood.

578
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,280
Anne is with her now.

579
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,077
Mr. Ren, this should
probably, perhaps, maybe...

580
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,000
It's better to go to the hospital
for a CT scan.

581
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,360
I suggest sending her to the hospital.

582
00:23:29,506 --> 00:23:30,517
Ms. Xia.

583
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,797
In your understanding,

584
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,800
only Western medicine
is called a hospital.

585
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,160
That signboard on my door

586
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,800
was also issued by
the National Health Commission as well.

587
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,917
I admit that
Chinese medicine is amazing.

588
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,440
Chinese medicine is very effective

589
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,757
on treating certain diseases,

590
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,920
like my dad's frozen shoulder.

591
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,317
But if we don't treat
the frozen shoulder,

592
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,360
it will be fine after some time.

593
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,477
But in Granny Mo Li's case,

594
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,877
if there are
other underlying diseases...

595
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,637
It'll be troublesome if
the pulmonary artery rupture, right?

596
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,520
You're right.
Coughing up blood alone is scary enough.

597
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,360
Annie cried badly.

598
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,757
Don't worry.

599
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,000
According to

600
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,840
Bai Mo Li's current condition,

601
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,160
coughing out blood is normal.

602
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,157
Discharge is also a natural phenomenon

603
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,317
of the body.

604
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,320
It's just like
we vomit and have diarrhea

605
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,040
after eating food that has gone bad.

606
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,157
Never doubt

607
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,720
the body's ability to resist this.

608
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,920
If according to her current condition,

609
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:21,960
by 1 a.m.,

610
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,597
she should be fine.

611
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,840
Well, go and inform her of this.

612
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:26,880
Ask her

613
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,640
to come back for a follow-up.

614
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,640
Okay.

615
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,437
Don't worry.

616
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,400
Good news!

617
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,918
-Mr. Ren.
-Xiao Hong.

618
00:24:34,001 --> 00:24:34,840
Good news.

619
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,277
I have found a place

620
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,880
which can be rented to us for our class.

621
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,320
Would you like to go and take a look?

622
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,360
What? You're abetting the evil too?

623
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,760
Where is it?

624
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,920
It's right around here.
You can go anytime.

625
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,717
I'll go now. I'll go get a change first.

626
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,157
Prof. Ren.
You're not visiting Granny Mo Li?

627
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,040
It's alright not to go.

628
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,600
Trust him.

629
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,400
I'll go and accompany her then.

630
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,240
Ms. Xia!
Wait for me. I'll go with you.

631
00:24:58,333 --> 00:24:59,493
Okay.

632
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,600
Mr. Ren.

633
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,840
I've checked almost
all the units around here.

634
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,440
This is the most suitable one.

635
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,477
First of all, it's big enough.

636
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,797
We can have many students here.

637
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,680
Do you know?

638
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,957
Previously, it was an art gallery.

639
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,437
They took off all the partitions,

640
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,800
so, it's very spacious here.

641
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,760
Ms. Dong can have
her technique class here.

642
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,120
By the way, Mr. Ren, this place here.

643
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,680
Come and have a look.

644
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,200
There are several small rooms here.

645
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,917
So, we can absolutely
have our consultations

646
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,837
and acupuncture classes in these rooms.

647
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,720
You're right.

648
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,037
The most important thing is

649
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,517
it's near the medical center.

650
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,440
It's very convenient
for us to arrange courses.

651
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,837
Also, students who walk to classes

652
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,157
can go home and sleep.

653
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,080
This can reduce
the burden of the apprentice class.

654
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,800
The main thing is,

655
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,080
when the landlord heard that
we are going to rent for a long time,

656
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,520
he gave us a great deal.

657
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,200
It definitely costs a lot of money.

658
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,640
Not bad.

659
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,520
The rental is
much cheaper than the market price.

660
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,640
Really?

661
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,720
This unit is really good.

662
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,920
But the price can't go any lower.

663
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:13,920
What should I do then?

664
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,757
How about I show you
other units around this area?

665
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,917
Is it the building over there?

666
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,720
That's right. I think it
fulfills one of your requests.

667
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,517
And in terms of unit price,

668
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,440
its area is bigger.

669
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,760
This is our lowest price.

670
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,120
You can contact me anytime
if you need anything.

671
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,797
Okay. Alright, I've got it. Thank you.

672
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,880
-Okay. Bye.
-Bye.

673
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,720
How is it?
Is this place okay?

674
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,280
Yes, it's okay.

675
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,280
The unit is okay.

676
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,197
Mr. Ma.

677
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,520
Please give me
more discount on the price.

678
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,320
Rebecca.

679
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,040
You're very clear about my market price.

680
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,517
I quoted the base price.

681
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,317
Not to mention
you want to sign for five years.

682
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,477
I didn't increase the rent.

683
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,477
I've told you.

684
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,720
If it's for my personal use,

685
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,920
I won't bargain with you at all.

686
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,317
But the apprentice class
is a charitable education.

687
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,120
The lower the cost, the better.

688
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,000
Well, everyone has an eye on this unit.

689
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,320
I know.

690
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,560
Otherwise, I wouldn't
have taken a liking at first glance.

691
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,560
But this unit doesn't face the street

692
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,840
and it's a distance away
from the subway stations.

693
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,077
There are
many Internet-famous shops here.

694
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,397
The market is already saturated.

695
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,157
It's hard to find someone like me
who want to rent the whole building

696
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,840
for a long time.

697
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,880
And the cost is high
if you want to rent separately.

698
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,317
The tenants
will come and go in a short period.

699
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,880
Not to mention
you are not familiar with them.

700
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,517
I know everything,
that's my credibility.

701
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,560
I won't run away.

702
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,800
Ms. Yang.

703
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,480
You're using
your credibility to make a guarantee.

704
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,200
What is it
that worth for you to do this?

705
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,960
The future of an industry.

706
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,560
Is this a venture capital?

707
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,320
What benefits can I get from it?

708
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,760
Can you give me some shares?

709
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,197
It's a charity. There's no return.

710
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,560
You can invest money and time,

711
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,800
and get the shares you want.

712
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,720
How about this, Mr. Ma?

713
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,880
As long as I rent this place,

714
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,240
I will provide
free legal services for you.

715
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,520
You said this yourself.

716
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,440
I can put this in the contract
as the additional term.

717
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,600
An exclusive term.

718
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,960
Alright, let's do that then.

719
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,760
-This way, please.
-Okay. Thank you.

720
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,520
You've worked hard.

721
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,000
This is what I should do.

722
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,760
Mainly it was my friend's help too.

723
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:51,880
I see.

724
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:04,880
I forgot about this.

725
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,640
Your piggy bank...

726
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,160
How much do you have?

727
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,440
About half.

728
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,600
When you go back later,

729
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,960
you can remove everything.

730
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,320
Xiao Hong.

731
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,280
Having an apprentice like you

732
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,480
makes me, your master,

733
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,960
feel pleased.

734
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,520
Thank you.

735
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:24,760
Mr. Ren.

736
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,520
But

737
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,960
in my heart,

738
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,557
I have chosen

739
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,440
Ms. Dong as my master.

740
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,560
That's because

741
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,040
I really want to inherit
the massage technique.

742
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,520
That's good.

743
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,400
Ms. Dong is good.

744
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,240
Ms. Dong is a rare person.

745
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,800
That's good.

746
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,240
By the way, Mr. Ren.

747
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,920
Although the rental isn't expensive,

748
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,720
the monthly expenses are quite high.

749
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,480
Don't worry.

750
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,720
I have money.

751
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,160
Thank you.

752
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,560
You're walking without a sound.
It's so scary!

753
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,720
Do we have a big box at home?

754
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:43,920
How big is it?

755
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,600
A size that can fit a human.

756
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,120
Who are you going to put in there?

757
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,320
A female apprentice found me a place.

758
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,560
The apprentice class can start now.

759
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,520
You must keep your promise.

760
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:57,880
Pack me up

761
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,160
and send it over.

762
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,240
Let me interview you.

763
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,680
Which female apprentice is so ignorant?

764
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,120
Ms. Yang the lawyer.

765
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,600
She?

766
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,760
Have you told her
how much of a loser you are?

767
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,237
Have you told her

768
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,477
you won't spend a penny
on women in your life?

769
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,680
Am I that stingy?

770
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,317
You?

771
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,800
She is rich.

772
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,520
She won't give me a look.

773
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,880
It's too early for you to dream.

774
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,840
Are you still selling this house?

775
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,520
Yes.

776
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,040
Why?

777
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,560
Someone will get you over.

778
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,560
Why do you want to sell my dad's house?

779
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,400
What? Sell the house?

780
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,560
The unit

781
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,080
that Yang Xiao Hong got for me

782
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,240
is cheap

783
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,437
and is in the city center.

784
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,320
We have to pay the rent.

785
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,560
Don't you think?

786
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,920
I've called the property agent.

787
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,160
He said not to worry about
that house in the community.

788
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,280
I'll be able to give you the money soon.

789
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,080
Besides that,
I've asked them to take note on

790
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,760
a suitable house for rent.

791
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,160
Don't worry.

792
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,117
We two retirees

793
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,397
are free to take care

794
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,680
and view the houses.

795
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,480
Master.

796
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,197
Ling Lan said our house...

797
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,560
Our house is not for sale.

798
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,717
I'm planning to clean it up

799
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,000
and move back.

800
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,440
Yes, it's small,
but we'll just squeeze in.

801
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,717
It's just that Meng Meng and Tou Tou

802
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,400
can't live with us.

803
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,840
We really have no place.

804
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,600
Let them go home.

805
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,280
I'll stay in the dormitory.
Let them use my room.

806
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,397
No.

807
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,517
I can't stay in the school

808
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,920
or Meng Meng can't stay here?

809
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:42,880
Both.

810
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,160
Tian Zhen must live here.

811
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:50,120
Otherwise, I won't have
a companion for a drink.

812
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,400
Tou Tou doesn't have a family.

813
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,677
We can make a bed for her

814
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,920
at the living hall.

815
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,277
Meng Meng has family. She can go home.

816
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,560
Grandpa, you...

817
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,157
How many years can I live?

818
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,280
Just be filial to me.

819
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,400
Let's have a walk.

820
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:06,960
That's not it.

821
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,720
So, which house are we selling?

822
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,240
It's not your house anyway.

823
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,560
What are you worrying about?

824
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,560
I'll just give you the money.

825
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,440
Are you planning to sell our house?

826
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,240
Use selling the house as an excuse

827
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,400
and get Meng Meng out of here.

828
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,280
Why don't you like Meng Meng?

829
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,440
If she becomes
your future daughter-in-law...

830
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,560
There is no "if".

831
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,120
If that day does arrive,

832
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,240
I'll sever my relationship with him.

833
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,920
Out of sight, out of mind.

834
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,357
Why are you so angry?

835
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,240
Just learn to accept it.

836
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,680
I can never learn.

837
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:41,880
And I don't want to learn.

838
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,200
Do you want to lose the son

839
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,000
and the husband?

840
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:56,640
What do you mean?

841
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,720
Nothing.

842
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,520
Are you planning to move to
Yang Xiao Hong's place tonight?

843
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:03,920
-What?
-Don't go!

844
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,240
So, you're jealous.

845
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,200
Me?

846
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,520
Why should I be jealous?

847
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,920
I want to get back

848
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,037
all the money, not a penny less,

849
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,040
that I had spent
on the first half of your life

850
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,760
from Yang Xiao Hong.

851
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,640
Jealous?

852
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,400
Well...

853
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,920
Why

854
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,520
did you come?

855
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,760
Where is her granddaughter?

856
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,000
He didn't leave since yesterday.

857
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,000
He asked for a room next to mine

858
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,560
and put a night there.

859
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,160
He was afraid that
something would happen to me.

860
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,317
My granddaughter

861
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,677
did not sleep all night.

862
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,000
She just went to sleep.

863
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,760
That's why Dr. Peng came with me.

864
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,600
I see.

865
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:27,717
Don't think nonsense.

866
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,677
I took the duty on
your dad's behalf. I respect him.

867
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,800
Are you still coughing today?

868
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,480
It has suddenly stopped coughing.

869
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,280
-You've stopped coughing?
-That's right.

870
00:36:34,582 --> 00:36:36,360
-You've stopped coughing?
-That's right.

871
00:36:36,434 --> 00:36:37,874
Let's go. I'll check for you.

872
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,360
Come.

873
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,520
-You...
-What?

874
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,960
How was your sleep last night?

875
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,160
Very good.

876
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,637
In fact, I have been sleeping well

877
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,320
since taking Chinese medicine.

878
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,280
I don't understand.

879
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,760
You'll understand
if you do it frequently.

880
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,440
You do have good sleep.

881
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,040
Yes.

882
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,280
Your pulse is much better than before.

883
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,797
You know, the Chinese characters
are very interesting.

884
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,600
I said, "shui jiao" (sleep).

885
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,280
The character "jiao"

886
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,200
can be pronounced as "jue",

887
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,000
as in "jue cha" (awareness).

888
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,717
When have you good sleep,

889
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,797
the various functions of your body

890
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,040
will have their awareness.

891
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,920
When your body is not feeling well,

892
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:51,480
it will adjust itself.

893
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,480
Remember this.

894
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,080
If a person can do three things well,

895
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,680
that means he should have good health.

896
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,200
Which three things?

897
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:03,880
Eat well,

898
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,200
sleep well,

899
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,360
and excrete well.

900
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,000
There are many reasons for
people to get sick, not just three.

901
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,080
Let's say, flu.

902
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,640
What does it have to do
with these three things?

903
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:20,040
Well, why some people could
get infected while the others couldn't?

904
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,760
That's because

905
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:24,840
of your physical immunity.

906
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,837
What is physical immunity?

907
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,120
That is to say, it should be in order.

908
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,000
If your body functions are in order.

909
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:36,840
the virus won't take advantage of it.

910
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,280
It's just like
charging our mobile phones.

911
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,000
Charging is sleeping.

912
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,680
It will function as normal
if there're apps.

913
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,240
But

914
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,717
there must be space in the phone.

915
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,280
If there is no space,

916
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,800
that mobile phone is useless.

917
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:54,920
Understood.

918
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,437
So, to "excrete" means

919
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,120
it is necessary
to clean the memory frequently.

920
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,920
In fact, I often tell my students that

921
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,960
everything

922
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,040
should follow the rules.

923
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,560
If you have found the rules,

924
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,360
you'd naturally find the solution.

925
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,440
If it is proper, it will run on its own.

926
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,080
If it's not proper,
it should be eliminated.

927
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,917
No wonder TCM practitioners always say

928
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,360
there should be harmony
between heaven, earth, and man.

929
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:23,000
I thought it meant that humans should be
in harmony with heaven and earth.

930
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,680
If a person's
body functions are in order,

931
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,277
then he can

932
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,880
be in harmony with heaven and earth.

933
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,160
By the way, Mr. Ren,

934
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,960
there is another thing
that I'm curious about.

935
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,320
How do you know

936
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,360
that she will stop coughing at 1 a.m.?

937
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,040
It's written in the book.

938
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,600
Book? Which book?

939
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,720
Look at you.

940
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,197
You didn't study well.

941
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,080
Tou Tou.

942
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,440
You tell him.

943
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,357
"Taiyin disease." "The disease
could be lifted from 11 p.m. to 3 a.m."

944
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,160
"Article No. 275,
Treatise on Febrile Diseases."

945
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,600
Amazing! I didn't see it coming.

946
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,037
I just knew that

947
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,240
he would definitely test me today.

948
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,440
So, I went to memorize it
the night before.

949
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,040
You're great.

950
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,560
You're the roundworm in my stomach then.

951
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:17,840
Amazing.

952
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,640
Books from more than
2,000 years ago still works today.

953
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:21,960
It's unbelievable.

954
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,720
Mdm. Bai Mo Li.

955
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,760
I'm going to change
a prescription for you.

956
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,440
Am I going to be recovered?

957
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:33,960
Take it easy.

958
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,677
Look.

959
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,560
That's why I said
Chinese medicine is a slow doctor.

960
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,837
I don't like listening to you.

961
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,155
No one likes to listen to him.

962
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,649
-Get out!
-Get out!

963
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:45,133
I just want to liven up the atmosphere.

964
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,253
Look, these are students.

965
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,037
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

966
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,597
(are referenced from relevant
traditional Chinese medicine books)

967
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,960
