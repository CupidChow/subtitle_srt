1
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,920
Don't negotiate terms with me.

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:07,797
It's just like

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,480
I can't negotiate terms
with you on my studies.

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:11,957
Confucius says,
"Having heard the way in the morning,

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,197
one may die content in the evening."

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,320
But it should be
die immediately instead.

7
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,080
Make a call and apologize.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,320
Make a call and apologize.

9
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,520
You're a grown-up! Be a sensible one!

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,680
You should be taught, you know.

11
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,733
Mom.

12
00:00:50,927 --> 00:00:52,093
You have made progress

13
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,560
in your writing. Really.

14
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,837
It's true. Practice well.

15
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,800
If you work hard for another two years,

16
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,000
you can catch up with me.

17
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,677
I can never catch up with you

18
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,960
on this matter.

19
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,120
Hello, what happened?

20
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,640
Ling Lan.

21
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,760
We just had our dinner.

22
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,000
You know what? At night, it's
really cold here in the mountains.

23
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,197
The back of my neck feels cold.

24
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,920
So, I suddenly remembered...

25
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,840
Every time you wake up in the morning.

26
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,280
You've scared me.

27
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,037
I've put that scarf

28
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,280
in Tian Zhen's backpack.

29
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,597
Remember to get it from him.

30
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,080
Don't catch a cold.

31
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,360
Okay.

32
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,877
Thank you so much

33
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,997
for being so sweet

34
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:53,920
(and attentive every day.)

35
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,240
(Ask your parents)

36
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,480
to rest early.

37
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,080
Alright.

38
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,880
I'll stop here.
Okay, bye.

39
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,560
What's wrong? What happened?

40
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,200
Nothing.

41
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,160
He's asking about you.

42
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,840
Everything is fine? Really?

43
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,040
I think he should be fine.

44
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,600
But...

45
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,520
It's weird.

46
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,160
This is rare.

47
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,040
Previously, he never called me

48
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,520
when he went out.

49
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,880
What are you laughing at?

50
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,440
Men are late bloomers.

51
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,560
Do you still remember?

52
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,037
When you were one year old,

53
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,920
your father came back from Ningxia

54
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,400
and said to you...

55
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,480
Call me "uncle".

56
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,277
You remember this forever?

57
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,000
I will remember this forever.

58
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,197
That's why people say

59
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,080
a man

60
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,077
is just like the flat peach

61
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,637
in Jade Emperor's garden

62
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,997
that blooms in three thousand years

63
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,720
and bears fruit in three thousand years.

64
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,797
If you are impatient

65
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,197
and run away

66
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,320
before picking the fruits,

67
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,397
that's because you are not

68
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,440
blessed enough.

69
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,720
Mom.
Please analyze it for me.

70
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,997
Everyone says that

71
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,360
there must be something strange
about things going wrong.

72
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,000
He is being abnormal

73
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,720
and started to care
about me out of a sudden.

74
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,440
Could it be that

75
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,840
something has happened?

76
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,360
His age is catching up.

77
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,120
He is fine.

78
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,477
Why are you looking at me?
Continue with your writing.

79
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,360
I...

80
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,600
I'm happy for you.

81
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,680
I've called her.

82
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,760
Mr. Ren. Happy Teacher's Day.

83
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,720
Keep it.

84
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,637
It's just
a little token of my gratitude.

85
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,320
Take it.

86
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,520
Take it.

87
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,680
Say it again.

88
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,760
Happy Teacher's Day.

89
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,600
Thanks.

90
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,517
This is my first time eating
wild vegetables. It's delicious.

91
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,920
Wild vegetables are delicious.

92
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,600
But it's all vegetables
and I don't feel full.

93
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,591
I ate three steamed buns just now

94
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,520
and I'm not full either.
There's nothing to eat.

95
00:05:15,601 --> 00:05:16,997
There were more vegetables than meat.

96
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,557
If we had beggar chicken,

97
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,720
that'd be better.

98
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,200
Slowly.

99
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,720
Beggar chicken?

100
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,357
You've eaten beggar chicken before?

101
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,757
I haven't tried it before.
Is it tasty?

102
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,880
It's of course tasty.

103
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,797
In the Legend of the Condor Heroes,

104
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,717
Hong Qigong was willing

105
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,757
to teach Guo Jing martial arts

106
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,160
because of Huang Rong's beggar chicken.

107
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,680
Mix water and mud

108
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,240
and use it to wrap the chicken,

109
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,760
then roast it.

110
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,917
After a while, the mud becomes

111
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,400
fragrant and sweet.

112
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,480
When the mud
becomes half dry and half wet,

113
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,197
peel off the dried mud.

114
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,797
The chicken feathers

115
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,160
will fall off with the mud.

116
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,917
Stop talking.

117
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,206
I'm hungry again.
I'm drooling.

118
00:06:18,193 --> 00:06:19,444
Who is it?

119
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,837
-The money...
-No, no.

120
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,878
-Professor Ren.
-Listen to me.

121
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:36,640
You usually don't charge us
for the medical treatment.

122
00:06:36,724 --> 00:06:37,797
This...

123
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,637
They're different matters.

124
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,240
You must take this money.

125
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,662
Thank you so much.

126
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,078
You better keep her in check.
Thank you.

127
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,166
Don't let her run around in the village.
We've troubled you.

128
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,317
I'll not send you off.

129
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,200
Okay. Okay. Okay.

130
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,560
Mr. Ren, I was wrong.

131
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,120
I know I was wrong. Really.

132
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,040
But I didn't mean to.

133
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,280
I was...

134
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,800
I was

135
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,440
curious.

136
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,960
It was out of curiosity.

137
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,477
It's written in the book

138
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,477
that the beggar chicken
is very delicious.

139
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,520
I just wanted to taste it.

140
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,400
I wanted to pay for it,

141
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,000
but I didn't see anyone

142
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,520
or any payment code.

143
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,600
I was thinking that after eating,

144
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,920
I would...

145
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,320
I was wrong.

146
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,880
Actually,
I thought about it for a long time.

147
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,477
It's such a tough job.

148
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,440
Why did my master and his wife

149
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,120
make it difficult for me.

150
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,440
It had gone away!

151
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,320
But now it comes back again.

152
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,800
I've figured it out now.

153
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,280
God is enlightening me.

154
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,717
To think of goodness, that's Buddha.

155
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,280
To think of evil, that's devil.

156
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,560
In fact, humans are

157
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,600
going back and forth
between the Buddha and the devil.

158
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,117
And you are

159
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,520
going back and forth
between the devil and the Buddha.

160
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,080
You...

161
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,477
I'm...

162
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,360
What?

163
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,240
You've frightened me.

164
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,400
Aren't you bold?

165
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,917
In the afternoon, you were carrying
Lawyer Yang on your back

166
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,320
and went downhill to the hospital.

167
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,720
You were doing good deeds.

168
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,320
But you stole a chicken at night!

169
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,800
I've thought it through.

170
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,837
I can't be too strict about you.

171
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,760
How about this?

172
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,680
Can you

173
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,037
do ten good deeds

174
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,080
before doing bad things?

175
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,477
When you do bad things

176
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,760
every month, at least

177
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,720
there is a quota on it.

178
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,160
As long as you can do it,

179
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,280
I'll consider that

180
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,320
I've taught you.

181
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,120
Okay?

182
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,000
Mr. Ren, I know I was wrong.

183
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,240
About what?

184
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,320
I shouldn't steal
someone else's chicken.

185
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,760
But what's written
on the book is also wrong.

186
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,117
It says that
the beggar chicken is tasty.

187
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,000
It's not tasty at all.

188
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,440
No, Mr. Ren. The...

189
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,240
It's true! The beggar chicken
is not tasty at all!

190
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,480
What I did was in vain!

191
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,400
I'll beat you to death!

192
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,477
Your cooking is bad.

193
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,440
You shouldn't blame me.

194
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,000
Alright, students.

195
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,440
Dismiss. Go to bed early.

196
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,760
Let's dismiss.

197
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:19,880
Let's go, Meng Meng.

198
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,240
Mr. Ren!

199
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,560
Mr. Ren!

200
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,800
I don't want it anymore!

201
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,557
He... He's chasing me again!

202
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,520
He's chasing me again!

203
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,000
Speak for me!

204
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,117
She helped us
clean the chicken coop.

205
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,037
It's very clean.

206
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,000
She did a tough task.

207
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,440
It's for you.

208
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,360
A reward!

209
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,440
We should accept the two chickens.

210
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,880
Come.

211
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,760
You've scared me.

212
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,240
You kept running.

213
00:12:46,513 --> 00:12:47,677
You didn't make it clear.

214
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,680
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

215
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,120
It has fallen asleep.

216
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,840
Mr. Ren.
Have a seat.

217
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,437
I just want to tell you that

218
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,800
I'll give you this piggy bank.

219
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,200
Manage the good and bad

220
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,960
separately.

221
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,960
There is a limit for doing bad things.

222
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,000
And you'll be rewarded
if you do good deeds.

223
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,560
If you have improved in the future,

224
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,600
whenever you do a good deed,

225
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,160
I'll...

226
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,040
I'll insert a coin

227
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,480
into the piggy bank.

228
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,480
When the piggy bank is full,

229
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,080
that means your apprenticeship is over.

230
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,120
But today, your performance

231
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,280
is worth inserting a coin.

232
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,560
Well, Mr. Ren.

233
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,917
This piggy bank is a bit too small.

234
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,997
It'll be full

235
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,240
after I work for a few more days.

236
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,997
I'm not saying that

237
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,880
you'll get a coin if you work for a day.

238
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,120
The criteria for getting a coin

239
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,720
will be decided by me.

240
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,000
Okay.

241
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,040
You did a great deed today.

242
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,520
So, he gave you two chickens.

243
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,840
Thanks to you too

244
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,320
for sacrificing yourselves

245
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,520
to be our learning subject.

246
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,320
Mr. Ren, stop it.

247
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,717
Right now,

248
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,440
I can't eat the chickens anymore.

249
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,360
It's so fragrant!

250
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It's really fragrant, Mr. Ren.

251
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,677
Why the one I ate last night

252
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,680
has a completely different taste?

253
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,240
That book didn't lie to me.

254
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,437
This beggar chicken...

255
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,800
This really is beggar chicken?

256
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,037
I didn't do it right yesterday.

257
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,040
It's tasty.

258
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,240
Tou Tou.

259
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,280
Have you ever thought about it?

260
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,480
Both are chickens.

261
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,760
Why the one you ate yesterday
doesn't taste good,

262
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,640
but today's chicken is tasty?

263
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,320
Yes, I've thought about it.

264
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,200
Yesterday,

265
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,320
I didn't put the seasoning right.

266
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,400
That's why it was tasteless.

267
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,640
What else?

268
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,197
Well, yesterday, I was terrified.

269
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,160
So, you know,
the chicken actually wasn't cooked.

270
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,280
It wasn't cooked.

271
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,840
That's why

272
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,600
those that are placed on the table

273
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,400
and are

274
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,317
tasty food

275
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,600
are all

276
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,157
through complicated process

277
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,320
and cooked for a long time.

278
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,280
Think about it. This chicken
was roasted for three hours.

279
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,317
It's obviously tastes better than

280
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,797
the chicken you cooked
by skimping ingredients

281
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,877
and feeling scared.

282
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,720
You cooked like
you're a thief, would that be tasty?

283
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,760
Mr. Ren.

284
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,757
This meat on the feet of the chicken...

285
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,640
Come.

286
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,600
This biggest drumstick is for you.

287
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,797
I don't really like that part.

288
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,200
I prefer this one.

289
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,880
The meat at the corners.

290
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,280
Mr. Qiu.

291
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,960
Tou Tou has become sensible.

292
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,920
She knows to be humble now.

293
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,280
Good. Give this piece
of meat to Mr. Qiu.

294
00:16:31,712 --> 00:16:32,998
Mr. Qiu, here you go.

295
00:16:33,689 --> 00:16:34,876
Tou Tou.

296
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,080
You've worked hard today.

297
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,480
This piece of good meat,

298
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,756
you should eat it.

299
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,640
Enjoy the fruits of your labor.

300
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,517
Alright.

301
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,400
You eat it.

302
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,400
Eat it.

303
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,877
Don't you eat, okay?

304
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,520
You're so tall now.

305
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,760
I'll eat it.

306
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,560
I'm growing up, you know.

307
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,760
Tou Tou.

308
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,040
After eating the chicken,

309
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,600
then start to memorize the classic.

310
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,600
Why do I have to do that again?

311
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,837
You must remember this.

312
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,520
Studying is not about

313
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,480
following what other people say.

314
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,960
It's not about hearsay.

315
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,520
You should

316
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,600
concentrate and delve into studying.

317
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,320
As the saying goes,
"if someone else gets it in one try,

318
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:25,960
I will try one hundred times."

319
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,680
"If someone else gets it in ten tries,

320
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,840
I will try one thousand times."

321
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,080
"If you can follow this way,

322
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,640
then even if you are stupid,
you will become enlightened."

323
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,360
"Even if you are weak,
you will become strong."

324
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,640
Read hundreds of times

325
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,800
and you will find the meaning.

326
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,360
Do you understand?

327
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:48,920
Mr. Ren.

328
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,800
Don't worry.

329
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,077
I will definitely learn from you.

330
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,360
I will study hard.

331
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,600
Can I not memorize the classics tonight?

332
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,120
Eat.

333
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,997
These glutinous rice balls

334
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,357
are fragrant and chewy.

335
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,840
They're full of nutty aroma.

336
00:18:21,924 --> 00:18:23,078
I'm hungry.

337
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,280
Cook more.

338
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,396
This is not enough.

339
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,280
Okay.

340
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,040
Let me get a bowl.

341
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,640
Meng Meng,
the glutinous rice balls are ready.

342
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:32,880
Here you go.

343
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,477
Your parents are going to take you home

344
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,600
for a reunion during
the Mid-Autumn Festival.

345
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,597
I bought you two boxes
lava custard mooncake.

346
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,840
Bring them home with you.

347
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,640
What's wrong?

348
00:18:42,724 --> 00:18:43,980
You don't miss them?

349
00:18:53,159 --> 00:18:54,357
Quan.

350
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,806
The medical center is closed on the
Mid-Autumn Festival. Are you going home?

351
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,320
I won't go back for now.

352
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,797
Three days off,

353
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,997
but I'll be traveling on the road
for one and a half days.

354
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,120
It's not worth it.

355
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,597
Coincidentally, Xing Xing

356
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,760
recommended me to a physiotherapy job.

357
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,797
I'm taking the opportunity
to make some extra money.

358
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,120
Okay. Go back and wait for me. I'll
give you two boxes of mooncakes.

359
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,960
Anyway, I bought a lot

360
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,760
to eat it on that day.

361
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,260
Thanks.

362
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,877
Cook more, please.
Everyone is very hungry.

363
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,380
Okay.

364
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,120
I'm getting another bowl.

365
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,277
The Mid-Autumn Festival
is around the corner.

366
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,797
How are you going to celebrate it?

367
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,520
Go back home and look for mummy!

368
00:19:37,673 --> 00:19:38,837
That's very clever of you.

369
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,193
Mr. Ren!

370
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,080
Hurry up, we're all waiting for you.

371
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,240
I'm ready.

372
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,600
You're not going to test me?

373
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,320
Studying

374
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,637
is your own business.

375
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,920
If you want to study,

376
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,237
you'll surely remember it.

377
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,157
If you don't want to study,

378
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,480
no matter how I test you,

379
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,720
you'll forget anyway.

380
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,000
Hurry up, get that.

381
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,640
Yes, we're waiting for you.

382
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,480
-Thanks.
-Be careful. It's hot.

383
00:20:10,564 --> 00:20:11,760
It's hot.

384
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,517
I was wondering why

385
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,477
you were so happy just now.

386
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,840
So, you're eating glutinous rice balls.

387
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:20,880
Eat it while it's hot.

388
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,320
We were talking about
the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday.

389
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,920
Today,

390
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,040
we happened to have a meal together

391
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,320
before the festive season.

392
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,077
So, let me wish all of you

393
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,480
have a joyful holiday in advance.

394
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,800
Happy holidays.

395
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,240
Happy holidays.

396
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,600
Tomorrow,

397
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,400
all of us will go home.

398
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,997
When you're on your way home,

399
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,240
please take care of your safety.

400
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,120
The most important thing is

401
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,200
don't forget about your homework.

402
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,197
We'll remember that.

403
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,080
We'll remember that.

404
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,440
Mr. Ren, Mr. Qiu.

405
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,440
Happy holidays!

406
00:21:03,524 --> 00:21:04,638
You've become sensible.

407
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:05,637
They've become sensible.

408
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,360
-That's right.
-Thank you!

409
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,840
Eat it while it's hot.

410
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,360
Why must we have holidays?

411
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,757
We're doing good.
Why must we have holidays?

412
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,960
Isn't this nice?

413
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,157
If you go back home during the holiday,

414
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,240
where should I go?

415
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,597
How did you spend

416
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,477
your previous Mid-Autumn Festivals then?

417
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,360
Working.

418
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,480
Working.

419
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,600
I can earn one or two thousand
a day during the festive season.

420
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,437
The salary is three times
higher than usual at this period.

421
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,960
I'm definitely going to make money.

422
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,160
If...

423
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,560
If all of you are going back home,

424
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,880
where should I go?

425
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,840
Come to my house during the holiday.

426
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,040
Go to your house?

427
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,040
That's right.

428
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,320
Come to my house.

429
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,080
That's not good.

430
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,233
I'll give you some glutinous rice balls.

431
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,760
Here, Mr. Ren.
Some glutinous rice balls for you.

432
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:27,280
(The autumnal equinox refers not only
to the equal length of day and night,

433
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,480
but also the one splitting
the Chinese solar terms of autumn.)

434
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,640
(The autumnal equinox was once
a traditional feast of the moon.）

435
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,477
(The Mid-Autumn Festival evolved

436
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,440
from the "feast of the moon
during autumn twilight".)

437
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,040
(Autumnal Equinox)

438
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,757
Dad! I'm going to school today.

439
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,157
I'm about to submit my PhD thesis.

440
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,506
I need to do some literature research.

441
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,120
Bring along Tou Tou.

442
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,477
I'm not going.

443
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,397
I'm on holiday.

444
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,043
And Meng Meng has gone back home.

445
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,600
I'm not going to the library.

446
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,360
Everyone else can have a holiday

447
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,640
but you.

448
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,520
Your foundation is too weak.

449
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,640
You must make up
your weakness with hard work.

450
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,760
I'll drive the car here then.

451
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,077
I've arranged for you

452
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,360
to recite the classics every day.

453
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,160
You must stick around
even when you're on holiday.

454
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,320
Every night at eight o'clock,

455
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,680
I'll be waiting for you
in the study on time.

456
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,400
If that's the case,

457
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,720
what's the difference
between having a holiday or not?

458
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,720
Holidays are arranged by humans.

459
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,560
In the eyes of God,

460
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,120
a holiday is about studying.

461
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,680
Studying is on holiday.

462
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,760
When I was young,

463
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,120
I only studied during the holidays.

464
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,200
I had to do farming on the usual days.

465
00:23:59,040 --> 00:23:59,840
Go and get a change.

466
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,800
Let me watch for another five minutes.
I'll go after watching this episode.

467
00:24:03,884 --> 00:24:05,186
Go now.

468
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,600
When we're out of the
neighborhood, your holiday will start.

469
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,037
Go wherever you want

470
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,040
and do whatever you want.

471
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,440
We'll fix a time and come home together.

472
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,320
What do you mean?

473
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,640
We're not going to the library?

474
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,757
I'm going.
You don't like to study, right?

475
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,480
-You don't have to go.
-I have to go.

476
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,600
Studying will make your dad happy.

477
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,677
When your dad is happy,

478
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,960
your family will be happy.

479
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:20,957
I have other things to do.

480
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:21,920
Go play by yourself.

481
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,000
Ren Tian Zhen.

482
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,800
You've changed.

483
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,360
You're dishonest now. You're lying.

484
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,917
You want to go out
and have fun, don't you?

485
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,917
But you lie to your dad and say

486
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,120
you are going to the library.

487
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,120
Am I right?

488
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,640
Your dad said this.

489
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,877
"Sincerity is the way of Heaven."

490
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,320
"Making oneself sincere
is the way of man."

491
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,757
You are lying to your family now.

492
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,120
Why have you become like this?

493
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,120
Tell me!

494
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,080
Who are you meeting?

495
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,037
I'm going to meet my classmate.

496
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,477
You don't know him. You want to go?

497
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,397
I'll go. Why shouldn't I?

498
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,880
I will know him when I go there.

499
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,120
Which classmate?

500
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,920
I can take you there.

501
00:26:04,272 --> 00:26:05,277
But promise me.

502
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,997
You can't spill the bean
on today's matter.

503
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,680
-Okay.
-Besides that,

504
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,120
consider this another
skateboarding class.

505
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,040
Okay?

506
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,160
Get in the car.

507
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,560
(Ren Tian Zhen's Secret Operations)

508
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,160
Ren Tian Zhen.

509
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,320
Do you really want to play this?

510
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,800
It's dangerous.

511
00:27:15,659 --> 00:27:18,320
Dangerous? There are more
exciting and dangerous ones.

512
00:27:19,239 --> 00:27:20,516
There are more?

513
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,266
Let's go. Let's fly. Let's feel it.

514
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,960
-It's okay. I don't play this.
-Don't be so polite. Let's go.

515
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,960
No, I don't play this.

516
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,440
You are fearless.

517
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,280
You should feel this child's game.

518
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,437
Listen.
It's good that I could come with you.

519
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,160
-You're too polite.
-I'm not going!

520
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:43,760
Okay.

521
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,080
I'll fly now.

522
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,757
Don't be anxious.

523
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,200
Take a stroll on this mountain.

524
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,597
I hope to see you
down the mountain tonight.

525
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,480
Goodbye.

526
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,640
You're really going to do that?

527
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,680
Ren Tian Zhen!

528
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,520
Ren Tian Zhen!

529
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,320
Where are we having dinner tonight?

530
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,160
(Ren Tian Zhen's Secret Operations)

531
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,200
You're tired already?

532
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,837
I thought you only play

533
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,280
games like skateboarding.

534
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,757
I didn't expect you to play

535
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,640
such exciting games too.

536
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:51,077
This is nothing.
I still have many difficult challenges

537
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,080
which I haven't completed yet.

538
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,720
What else?

539
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,520
Look. What is this?

540
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,520
Did you put your
bank card's password on this?

541
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,760
You're cheesy.

542
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,397
Except for the bank card's password,

543
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,277
what else is worth taking with you?

544
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,160
Tell me.

545
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,920
Something unreachable

546
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,000
and hard to get.

547
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,520
Ren Tian Zhen.

548
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,520
Let me ask you a question.

549
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,517
Is it illegal

550
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,680
to speak human language in your house?

551
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,637
Just give a simple answer

552
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,037
when I ask a question.

553
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,677
Why must you say something

554
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,720
that I don't understand?

555
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,240
This here. Look at this blank space.

556
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,320
Is it a semi-finished product?

557
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,960
This is my list of challenges.

558
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,720
Every time I complete a challenge,

559
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,880
I'll carve the latitude
and longitude of that place on it.

560
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,957
It's a kind of record and certification

561
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,040
of my self-challenge.

562
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,400
Look.

563
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,000
Skiing.

564
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:54,920
Skydiving.

565
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,160
Diving.

566
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,640
Okay, okay.
Rock climbing.

567
00:30:58,707 --> 00:30:59,719
Okay, okay.

568
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,520
So, what do you have left to accomplish?

569
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,480
My next plan

570
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,280
is to do all those things
in the country.

571
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,160
I'm going to do bungee jumping

572
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,320
at Shiyan.

573
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,240
In a sense,

574
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,877
jumping off in that way

575
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,360
is probably the closest
you can get to ascending.

576
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,320
I envy you.

577
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,600
Well, this is how rich kids are.

578
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,637
It's such a deadly thing,

579
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,400
but you sounded like it's aspiring.

580
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,680
You envy me, and I envy you too.

581
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,720
Why do you envy me?

582
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,120
I'm the only child in my family.

583
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,720
Countless pairs of eyes in my family

584
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,117
keep staring at me

585
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,480
from the moment I was born.

586
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,877
They are afraid that
something will happen to me

587
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,880
if I'm not being careful.

588
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,880
But I do feel for them.

589
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,840
And I understand them now.

590
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,680
The way you enjoy the games

591
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,600
might really cost your life.

592
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,480
That is why

593
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,200
having parents is good,

594
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,240
but not having parents
is not as miserable as you say.

595
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,240
My life belongs to my family.

596
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,480
Your life belongs to you.

597
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:23,880
How nice it is.

598
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,320
Come, let's play for another two rounds.

599
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,517
You reminded me just now.

600
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,000
I was rootless before.

601
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,080
But I have it now.

602
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,240
I am the successor of
the Jiang family's acupuncture sect.

603
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,320
If something happens to me,

604
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,117
the acupuncture sect will be over.

605
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,877
So, my life is very precious now.

606
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,920
I want to cherish it.

607
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,637
I can't care much about your sect.

608
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,240
But I want to protect my sect.

609
00:32:59,120 --> 00:32:59,920
Just you go.

610
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,400
Okay.

611
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,760
Successor, you must protect yourself.

612
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,080
Take it easy!

613
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,480
Don't worry.

614
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,960
This is not the way to go back home.

615
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,320
The most important trip
hasn't started yet.

616
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,280
We're not going back yet?

617
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,437
We have to go back now.

618
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,077
I still haven't do
the calligraphy exercise.

619
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,397
If your dad checks my homework tonight,

620
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,840
I'm sure I'll be dead.

621
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,000
There's enough time to do it.

622
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,880
There's not enough time to do it!

623
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,120
What are you going to buy at this place?

624
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,200
You'll find out later.

625
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,360
Mr. Ren.

626
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,400
I haven't seen you for a long time.

627
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,640
What good things did you bring today?

628
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,680
Take a look.

629
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,437
You know
if this thing I wore is real or fake.

630
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,360
And you know
the price of the good agarwood now.

631
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,680
I can say
there is no price for this piece.

632
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,760
It's a good stuff.

633
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,680
But it has your birth date on it.

634
00:34:46,764 --> 00:34:48,077
You also know

635
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,440
those who wear agarwood pendants
are for own or family protection.

636
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,680
Not very good to offer.

637
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:52,800
Quote a price.

638
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,160
How about this?

639
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,580
One time offer.
One hundred thousand.

640
00:34:55,767 --> 00:34:57,000
One hundred...

641
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,360
One hundred thousand?

642
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,758
What is this

643
00:35:03,841 --> 00:35:05,240
that costs one hundred thousand?

644
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,077
I didn't know you were wearing

645
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,440
such an expensive thing.

646
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:09,837
Deal.

647
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,386
Okay.

648
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,560
How much is your watch?

649
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,480
Let me see.

650
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,920
The watch...
Watch...

651
00:35:20,004 --> 00:35:21,318
What are you doing?

652
00:35:21,401 --> 00:35:22,877
I'm checking
what other valuable things you have.

653
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,277
-Don't touch me.
-Take it out.

654
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,677
Let's keep a distance. Man and
woman shouldn't touch each other.

655
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,560
Take it out.

656
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,600
You lost it?

657
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,600
You lost it?

658
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,800
Is it something that can be lost?

659
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,240
Think about it.

660
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,680
Did you leave it in the library?

661
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,960
That's right.
I'll call Head Librarian Wang

662
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,080
and ask him to find it.

663
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,280
Mom, no need for that.

664
00:35:48,364 --> 00:35:50,280
It's the festive season.
He is celebrating with his family too.

665
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,957
Let's call him
after the festive season, okay?

666
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,360
That's not okay.

667
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,900
It's such an important stuff.

668
00:35:54,984 --> 00:35:56,038
I'll call him.

669
00:35:56,121 --> 00:35:58,077
Mom, don't bother about this.
Don't need to call him.

670
00:35:58,173 --> 00:35:59,533
Go and find it at the library.

671
00:35:59,617 --> 00:36:00,993
Don't make your grandma worry.

672
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,880
Maybe it's not in the library.

673
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,477
Moreover, you gave me this.

674
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,680
It's not that I want to wear it.

675
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,080
Why blame me when I lost it?

676
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,877
Moreover, the string doesn't know that
the pendant is expensive.

677
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,317
I couldn't help it either

678
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,200
since the string broke.

679
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,920
This isn't the first time though.

680
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,240
The string has broken?

681
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,680
That's true.

682
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,040
I changed twice before.

683
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,240
It's all my fault.

684
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,797
I haven't changed it for a long time.

685
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,640
Mom, how can we blame you?

686
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,440
Hundreds of thousands are gone.

687
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,600
Hundreds of thousands?

688
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,440
It's been so long.

689
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,440
The pendant should be valuable now.

690
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,000
Head Librarian Wang.

691
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,440
Yes, yes. It's me.

692
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,720
I'd like to ask you something.

693
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,197
What a guy.

694
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,560
It's so expensive. If I had known
about it, I would have brought it back.

695
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,280
What did you say?

696
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,640
You would have brought it back?

697
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,080
No.

698
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,720
I mean,

699
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,480
I should have

700
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,397
searched properly in the library

701
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,720
since it's expensive stuff.

702
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:51,960
What are you doing?

703
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,720
I'm making one for Tian Zhen.

704
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,440
Our grandchildren
will have his own blessings.

705
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,717
He doesn't take that thing seriously,

706
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,797
so don't bother yourself with this.

707
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,680
Never mind.

708
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,000
That can't be.

709
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,197
He is the only child in our family.

710
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,280
We have to protect him.

711
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,280
I've lost count of it.

712
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,200
Since he was young,

713
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:18,320
I wonder why

714
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,160
those things that I gave him

715
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,400
all didn't last long.

716
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,600
Either he lost it

717
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,000
or someone stole it.

718
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,480
If this continues,

719
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,080
what should we do?

720
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,680
We'll do what we should do.

721
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,200
Since he was young,

722
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,400
he lost a lot of the amulets.

723
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,760
Yet he grew up safely.

724
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,437
We are old now.

725
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,997
We'll just keep these things with us.

726
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,320
Don't do it for him.

727
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:46,920
I know.

728
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,320
The pendant that he lost this time,

729
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,000
we must get it back.

730
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,160
But

731
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,120
my mom told me before.

732
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,280
The son of a prestigious family
has a short life.

733
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,600
He'll need something to suppress it.

734
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,560
It's getting more expensive.

735
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,720
Why are you here?

736
00:39:33,633 --> 00:39:34,717
Sun Tou Tou.

737
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,966
I'm...

738
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,080
I'm sitting here for a while.

739
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,040
You two have made a deal, right?

740
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,520
Professor Song.

741
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,960
I'm sorry I'm late.

742
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,520
How much did you pay for my son's stuff?

743
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,360
One hundred thousand.

744
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,320
One...

745
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,840
You know about it?

746
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,680
What does this mean?

747
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:15,920
You've sold it?

748
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,720
We have always been doing this.

749
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,560
He comes to sell stuff
and I come to redeem it.

750
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,200
Why did you sell it?

751
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,880
Yesterday, I went out for a drink.

752
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,477
I left the store to my staff.

753
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,798
He accidentally... He...

754
00:40:28,881 --> 00:40:30,840
I think you don't want
to do our business anymore.

755
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,800
Do you know this is called
embezzlement of assets?

756
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,277
It's hard for me too.

757
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,797
I've scolded him all morning.

758
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,185
-I...
-Who did he sell it to?

759
00:40:39,269 --> 00:40:40,676
Go and find that person.

760
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,997
The thing is

761
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,357
I don't know who he sold to.

762
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,612
He is not a regular customer.

763
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:49,872
What about your surveillance camera?

764
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,200
It's already broken.

765
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,459
It's just decoration.

766
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,197
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

767
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,917
(are referenced from relevant
traditional Chinese medicine books)

768
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,480
