00:01:30,668 --> 00:01:34,684
(Gen Z)

2
00:01:35,382 --> 00:01:37,834
(Episode 15)

3
00:01:39,179 --> 00:01:40,940
Don't negotiate terms with me.

4
00:01:41,699 --> 00:01:42,900
It's just like

5
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,499
I can't negotiate terms
with you on my studies.

6
00:01:45,724 --> 00:01:47,033
Confucius says,
"Having heard the way in the morning,

7
00:01:47,059 --> 00:01:48,259
one may die content in the evening."

8
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,335
But it should be
die immediately instead.

9
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,099
Make a call and apologize.

10
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,339
Make a call and apologize.

11
00:01:57,259 --> 00:01:59,540
You're a grown-up! Be a sensible one!

12
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,680
You should be taught, you know.

13
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,428
Mom.

14
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:26,979
You have made progress

15
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,560
in your writing. Really.

16
00:02:29,499 --> 00:02:30,900
It's true. Practice well.

17
00:02:30,926 --> 00:02:32,805
If you work hard for another two years,

18
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:35,020
you can catch up with me.

19
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,761
I can never catch up with you

20
00:02:40,787 --> 00:02:41,988
on this matter.

21
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,140
Hello, what happened?

22
00:02:52,859 --> 00:02:53,579
Ling Lan.

23
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,780
We just had our dinner.

24
00:02:57,659 --> 00:02:58,219
You know what?

25
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:00,020
At night, it's really cold
here in the mountains.

26
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,299
The back of my neck feels cold.

27
00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:04,939
So, I suddenly remembered...

28
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,859
Every time you wake up in the morning.

29
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,299
You've scared me.

30
00:03:14,867 --> 00:03:16,114
I've put that scarf

31
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,299
in Tian Zhen's backpack.

32
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:19,700
Remember to get it from him.

33
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,100
Don't catch a cold.

34
00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:22,339
Okay.

35
00:03:24,865 --> 00:03:25,953
Thank you so much

36
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:28,060
for being so sweet

37
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,920
(and attentive every day.)

38
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,259
(Ask your parents)

39
00:03:31,507 --> 00:03:32,507
to rest early.

40
00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:33,859
Alright.

41
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:35,060
I'll stop here.

42
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:35,881
Okay, bye.

43
00:03:44,059 --> 00:03:45,579
What's wrong? What happened?

44
00:03:46,419 --> 00:03:47,020
Nothing.

45
00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:49,180
He's asking about you.

46
00:03:49,659 --> 00:03:50,859
Everything is fine? Really?

47
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:55,059
I think he should be fine.

48
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,430
But...

49
00:03:57,699 --> 00:03:58,540
It's weird.

50
00:03:59,059 --> 00:04:00,180
This is rare.

51
00:04:00,939 --> 00:04:02,059
Previously, he never called me

52
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:03,540
when he went out.

53
00:04:12,939 --> 00:04:13,900
What are you laughing at?

54
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,440
Men are late bloomers.

55
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,560
Do you still remember?

56
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,139
When you were one year old,

57
00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:21,932
your father came back from Ningxia

58
00:04:22,499 --> 00:04:23,419
and said to you...

59
00:04:23,779 --> 00:04:25,499
Call me "uncle".

60
00:04:27,844 --> 00:04:29,363
You remember this forever?

61
00:04:29,389 --> 00:04:31,029
I will remember this forever.

62
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,260
That's why people say

63
00:04:33,299 --> 00:04:34,059
a man

64
00:04:34,579 --> 00:04:36,180
is just like the flat peach

65
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,740
in Jade Emperor's garden

66
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,100
that blooms in three thousand years

67
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,740
and bears fruit in three thousand years.

68
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,880
If you are impatient

69
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,299
and run away

70
00:04:44,299 --> 00:04:45,340
before picking the fruits,

71
00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:47,460
that's because you are not

72
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,440
blessed enough.

73
00:04:52,579 --> 00:04:53,340
Mom.

74
00:04:53,366 --> 00:04:54,740
Please analyze it for me.

75
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,091
Everyone says that

76
00:04:57,117 --> 00:04:59,397
there must be something strange
about things going wrong.

77
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,000
He is being abnormal

78
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:04,740
and started to care
about me out of a sudden.

79
00:05:05,667 --> 00:05:06,428
Could it be that

80
00:05:07,379 --> 00:05:08,860
something has happened?

81
00:05:09,613 --> 00:05:11,372
His age is catching up.

82
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:12,980
He is fine.

83
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,579
Why are you looking at me?
Continue with your writing.

84
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:27,219
I...

85
00:05:28,059 --> 00:05:29,620
I'm happy for you.

86
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,599
I've called her.

87
00:05:55,419 --> 00:05:56,780
Mr. Ren. Happy Teacher's Day.

88
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,740
Keep it.

89
00:06:07,379 --> 00:06:08,740
It's just
a little token of my gratitude.

90
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,340
Take it.

91
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,460
Take it.

92
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:13,620
Say it again.

93
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,780
Happy Teacher's Day.

94
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,522
Thanks.

95
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,579
This is my first time eating
wild vegetables. It's delicious.

96
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,920
Wild vegetables are delicious.

97
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:46,620
But it's all vegetables
and I don't feel full.

98
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,859
I ate three steamed buns just now

99
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:49,900
and I'm not full either.

100
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:50,620
There's nothing to eat.

101
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,020
There were more vegetables than meat.

102
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,600
If we had beggar chicken,

103
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:54,725
that'd be better.

104
00:06:56,419 --> 00:06:57,020
Slowly.

105
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:58,740
Beggar chicken?

106
00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:01,460
You've eaten beggar chicken before?

107
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,819
I haven't tried it before.
Is it tasty?

108
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,880
It's of course tasty.

109
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,900
In the Legend of the Condor Heroes,

110
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:06,819
Hong Qigong was willing

111
00:07:06,819 --> 00:07:07,859
to teach Guo Jing martial arts

112
00:07:07,859 --> 00:07:09,180
because of Huang Rong's beggar chicken.

113
00:07:10,842 --> 00:07:12,682
Mix water and mud

114
00:07:13,051 --> 00:07:14,252
and use it to wrap the chicken,

115
00:07:14,579 --> 00:07:15,780
then roast it.

116
00:07:16,564 --> 00:07:18,020
After a while, the mud becomes

117
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,419
fragrant and sweet.

118
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,500
When the mud
becomes half dry and half wet,

119
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,299
peel off the dried mud.

120
00:07:24,299 --> 00:07:25,900
The chicken feathers

121
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,180
will fall off with the mud.

122
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,020
Stop talking.

123
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:30,859
I'm hungry again.

124
00:07:30,859 --> 00:07:32,419
I'm drooling.

125
00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:53,979
Who is it?

126
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:08,220
The money...

127
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:08,940
No, no.

128
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:09,460
Professor Ren.

129
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:09,979
Listen to me.

130
00:08:09,979 --> 00:08:11,660
You usually don't charge us
for the medical treatment.

131
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:12,740
This...

132
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,740
They're different matters.

133
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,259
You must take this money.

134
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:16,780
Thank you so much.

135
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,539
You better keep her in check.

136
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:19,180
Thank you.

137
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,180
Don't let her run around in the village.

138
00:08:20,259 --> 00:08:20,940
We've troubled you.

139
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,340
I'll not send you off.

140
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:22,940
Okay.

141
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:23,579
Okay.

142
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:24,419
Okay.

143
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:36,579
Mr. Ren, I was wrong.

144
00:08:37,819 --> 00:08:39,139
I know I was wrong. Really.

145
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,060
But I didn't mean to.

146
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,281
I was...

147
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:44,699
I was

148
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,460
curious.

149
00:08:46,699 --> 00:08:47,979
It was out of curiosity.

150
00:08:48,539 --> 00:08:49,579
It's written in the book

151
00:08:49,579 --> 00:08:50,579
that the beggar chicken
is very delicious.

152
00:08:50,579 --> 00:08:52,539
I just wanted to taste it.

153
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,439
I wanted to pay for it,

154
00:08:54,579 --> 00:08:56,020
but I didn't see anyone

155
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,539
or any payment code.

156
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,620
I was thinking that after eating,

157
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,940
I would...

158
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,340
I was wrong.

159
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,919
Actually,
I thought about it for a long time.

160
00:09:17,579 --> 00:09:19,579
It's such a tough job.

161
00:09:19,579 --> 00:09:21,460
Why did my master and his wife

162
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,139
make it difficult for me.

163
00:09:32,259 --> 00:09:33,460
It had gone away!

164
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,357
But now it comes back again.

165
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,819
I've figured it out now.

166
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,281
God is enlightening me.

167
00:09:50,796 --> 00:09:53,819
To think of goodness, that's Buddha.

168
00:09:53,819 --> 00:09:56,299
To think of evil, that's devil.

169
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,579
In fact, humans are

170
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:03,620
going back and forth
between the Buddha and the devil.

171
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,200
And you are

172
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,540
going back and forth
between the devil and the Buddha.

173
00:10:13,139 --> 00:10:14,100
You...

174
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,540
I'm...

175
00:10:17,579 --> 00:10:18,300
What?

176
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,259
You've frightened me.

177
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,401
Aren't you bold?

178
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,020
In the afternoon, you were carrying
Lawyer Yang on your back

179
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,340
and went downhill to the hospital.

180
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,759
You were doing good deeds.

181
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,340
But you stole a chicken at night!

182
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:40,699
I've thought it through.

183
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,880
I can't be too strict about you.

184
00:10:43,939 --> 00:10:44,780
How about this?

185
00:10:45,451 --> 00:10:46,690
Can you

186
00:10:47,819 --> 00:10:49,139
do ten good deeds

187
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:51,100
before doing bad things?

188
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,548
When you do bad things

189
00:10:58,579 --> 00:10:59,780
every month, at least

190
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,720
there is a quota on it.

191
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,179
As long as you can do it,

192
00:11:03,499 --> 00:11:04,260
I'll consider that

193
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,359
I've taught you.

194
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:07,980
Okay?

195
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,039
Mr. Ren, I know I was wrong.

196
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,139
About what?

197
00:11:15,579 --> 00:11:17,340
I shouldn't steal
someone else's chicken.

198
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,780
But what's written
on the book is also wrong.

199
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,220
It says that
the beggar chicken is tasty.

200
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,020
It's not tasty at all.

201
00:11:29,139 --> 00:11:30,460
No, Mr. Ren. The...

202
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,279
It's true! The beggar chicken
is not tasty at all!

203
00:11:32,379 --> 00:11:33,499
What I did was in vain!

204
00:11:39,139 --> 00:11:40,420
I'll beat you to death!

205
00:11:40,619 --> 00:11:41,579
Your cooking is bad.

206
00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:42,460
You shouldn't blame me.

207
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,020
Alright, students.

208
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,460
Dismiss. Go to bed early.

209
00:11:47,819 --> 00:11:48,780
Let's dismiss.

210
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:54,819
Let's go, Meng Meng.

211
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,259
Mr. Ren!

212
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:50,579
Mr. Ren!

213
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:51,819
I don't want it anymore!

214
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,579
He... He's chasing me again!

215
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,540
He's chasing me again!

216
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:57,036
Speak for me!

217
00:13:58,579 --> 00:14:00,139
She helped us
clean the chicken coop.

218
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:01,100
It's very clean.

219
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,000
She did a tough task.

220
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,440
It's for you.

221
00:14:03,579 --> 00:14:04,340
A reward!

222
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,460
We should accept the two chickens.

223
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:17,660
Come.

224
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,780
You've scared me.

225
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,259
You kept running.

226
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:22,780
You didn't make it clear.

227
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:23,579
Thank you.

228
00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:24,699
You're welcome.

229
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,100
It has fallen asleep.

230
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:43,980
Mr. Ren.

231
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:45,860
Have a seat.

232
00:14:48,579 --> 00:14:49,540
I just want to tell you that

233
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,819
I'll give you this piggy bank.

234
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,220
Manage the good and bad

235
00:14:55,699 --> 00:14:56,980
separately.

236
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,980
There is a limit for doing bad things.

237
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,019
And you'll be rewarded
if you do good deeds.

238
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,599
If you have improved in the future,

239
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,600
whenever you do a good deed,

240
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,160
I'll...

241
00:15:15,836 --> 00:15:17,075
I'll insert a coin

242
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,480
into the piggy bank.

243
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,499
When the piggy bank is full,

244
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,100
that means your apprenticeship is over.

245
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:26,120
But today, your performance

246
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,280
is worth inserting a coin.

247
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,571
Well, Mr. Ren.

248
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,961
This piggy bank is a bit too small.

249
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,100
It'll be full

250
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,259
after I work for a few more days.

251
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,040
I'm not saying that

252
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,880
you'll get a coin if you work for a day.

253
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,139
The criteria for getting a coin

254
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,620
will be decided by me.

255
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:51,699
Okay.

256
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,079
You did a great deed today.

257
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,540
So, he gave you two chickens.

258
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,840
Thanks to you too

259
00:16:02,139 --> 00:16:03,340
for sacrificing yourselves

260
00:16:03,819 --> 00:16:05,540
to be our learning subject.

261
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,340
Mr. Ren, stop it.

262
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:17,819
Right now,

263
00:16:17,819 --> 00:16:19,460
I can't eat the chickens anymore.

264
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,379
It's so fragrant!

265
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,020
It's really fragrant, Mr. Ren.

266
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,780
Why the one I ate last night

267
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,699
has a completely different taste?

268
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,259
That book didn't lie to me.

269
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,540
This beggar chicken...

270
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:46,819
This really is beggar chicken?

271
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,139
I didn't do it right yesterday.

272
00:16:48,139 --> 00:16:49,059
It's tasty.

273
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,059
Tou Tou.

274
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,280
Have you ever thought about it?

275
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,499
Both are chickens.

276
00:16:57,699 --> 00:16:59,780
Why the one you ate yesterday
doesn't taste good,

277
00:17:00,139 --> 00:17:01,660
but today's chicken is tasty?

278
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,139
Yes, I've thought about it.

279
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,199
Yesterday,

280
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,340
I didn't put the seasoning right.

281
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:08,340
That's why it was tasteless.

282
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:10,660
What else?

283
00:17:11,259 --> 00:17:13,240
Well, yesterday, I was terrified.

284
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,180
So, you know,
the chicken actually wasn't cooked.

285
00:17:16,499 --> 00:17:17,300
It wasn't cooked.

286
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,840
That's why

287
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,615
those that are placed on the table

288
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,252
and are

289
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,379
tasty food

290
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,639
are all

291
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,200
through complicated process

292
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:33,340
and cooked for a long time.

293
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,360
Think about it.

294
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,280
This chicken
was roasted for three hours.

295
00:17:36,739 --> 00:17:38,420
It's obviously tastes better than

296
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,867
the chicken you cooked
by skimping ingredients

297
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:40,980
and feeling scared.

298
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,739
You cooked like
you're a thief, would that be tasty?

299
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:45,460
Mr. Ren.

300
00:17:46,117 --> 00:17:47,797
This meat on the feet of the chicken...

301
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,280
Come.

302
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,619
This biggest drumstick is for you.

303
00:17:51,379 --> 00:17:52,900
I don't really like that part.

304
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,220
I prefer this one.

305
00:17:54,411 --> 00:17:55,892
The meat at the corners.

306
00:17:57,499 --> 00:17:58,139
Mr. Qiu.

307
00:17:59,619 --> 00:18:00,980
Tou Tou has become sensible.

308
00:18:01,739 --> 00:18:02,959
She knows to be humble now.

309
00:18:03,828 --> 00:18:04,388
Good.

310
00:18:04,499 --> 00:18:05,220
Give this piece of meat

311
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,120
to Mr. Qiu.

312
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:07,699
Mr. Qiu, here you go.

313
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:09,579
Tou Tou.

314
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,099
You've worked hard today.

315
00:18:11,379 --> 00:18:12,499
This piece of good meat,

316
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,440
you should eat it.

317
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,679
Enjoy the fruits of your labor.

318
00:18:17,739 --> 00:18:18,619
Alright.

319
00:18:18,619 --> 00:18:19,300
You eat it.

320
00:18:22,619 --> 00:18:23,379
Eat it.

321
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:25,980
Don't you eat, okay?

322
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,540
You're so tall now.

323
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:28,699
I'll eat it.

324
00:18:29,379 --> 00:18:30,579
I'm growing up, you know.

325
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:31,460
Tou Tou.

326
00:18:32,259 --> 00:18:32,900
After eating the chicken,

327
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,619
then start to memorize the classic.

328
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,619
Why do I have to do that again?

329
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,899
You must remember this.

330
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,521
Studying is not about

331
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,499
following what other people say.

332
00:18:48,396 --> 00:18:49,996
It's not about hearsay.

333
00:18:51,139 --> 00:18:52,540
You should

334
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,600
concentrate and delve into studying.

335
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,339
As the saying goes,
"if someone else gets it in one try,

336
00:18:59,859 --> 00:19:00,979
I will try one hundred times."

337
00:19:01,499 --> 00:19:02,700
"If someone else gets it in ten tries,

338
00:19:03,619 --> 00:19:04,859
I will try one thousand times."

339
00:19:05,739 --> 00:19:07,099
"If you can follow this way,

340
00:19:07,859 --> 00:19:09,660
then even if you are stupid,
you will become enlightened."

341
00:19:10,379 --> 00:19:12,379
"Even if you are weak,
you will become strong."

342
00:19:12,979 --> 00:19:14,660
Read hundreds of times

343
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,800
and you will find the meaning.

344
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,259
Do you understand?

345
00:19:23,139 --> 00:19:23,820
Mr. Ren.

346
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:25,820
Don't worry.

347
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,132
I will definitely learn from you.

348
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,360
I will study hard.

349
00:19:33,459 --> 00:19:34,619
Can I not memorize the classics tonight?

350
00:19:39,339 --> 00:19:39,739
Eat.

351
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,040
These glutinous rice balls

352
00:19:54,099 --> 00:19:55,459
are fragrant and chewy.

353
00:19:55,459 --> 00:19:56,859
They're full of nutty aroma.

354
00:19:57,379 --> 00:19:58,180
I'm hungry.

355
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,139
Cook more.

356
00:19:59,379 --> 00:20:00,219
This is not enough.

357
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:01,099
Okay.

358
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,060
Let me get a bowl.

359
00:20:05,619 --> 00:20:06,660
Meng Meng,
the glutinous rice balls are ready.

360
00:20:07,099 --> 00:20:07,499
Here you go.

361
00:20:09,619 --> 00:20:10,535
Your parents are going to take you home

362
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,619
for a reunion during
the Mid-Autumn Festival.

363
00:20:11,979 --> 00:20:12,859
I bought you two boxes

364
00:20:12,859 --> 00:20:13,700
lava custard mooncake.

365
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,859
Bring them home with you.

366
00:20:16,859 --> 00:20:17,459
What's wrong?

367
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:18,580
You don't miss them?

368
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:29,139
Quan.

369
00:20:29,459 --> 00:20:30,499
The medical center is closed
on the Mid-Autumn Festival.

370
00:20:30,499 --> 00:20:31,300
Are you going home?

371
00:20:31,979 --> 00:20:33,339
I won't go back for now.

372
00:20:33,979 --> 00:20:34,900
Three days off,

373
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,099
but I'll be traveling on the road
for one and a half days.

374
00:20:36,099 --> 00:20:37,139
It's not worth it.

375
00:20:38,139 --> 00:20:39,660
Coincidentally, Xing Xing

376
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,780
recommended me to a physiotherapy job.

377
00:20:41,979 --> 00:20:43,900
I'm taking the opportunity
to make some extra money.

378
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:44,420
Okay.

379
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:44,979
Go back and wait for me.

380
00:20:44,979 --> 00:20:46,139
I'll give you two boxes of mooncakes.

381
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,979
Anyway, I bought a lot

382
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,780
to eat it on that day.

383
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:50,700
Thanks.

384
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:53,700
Cook more, please.

385
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,979
Everyone is very hungry.

386
00:20:54,979 --> 00:20:55,499
Okay.

387
00:20:59,339 --> 00:21:00,020
I'm getting another bowl.

388
00:21:08,069 --> 00:21:09,379
The Mid-Autumn Festival
is around the corner.

389
00:21:09,379 --> 00:21:10,900
How are you going to celebrate it?

390
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,540
Go back home and look for mummy!

391
00:21:13,379 --> 00:21:13,940
That's very clever of you.

392
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:14,459
Mr. Ren!

393
00:21:16,379 --> 00:21:18,099
Hurry up, we're all waiting for you.

394
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:21,259
I'm ready.

395
00:21:26,219 --> 00:21:27,619
You're not going to test me?

396
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,339
Studying

397
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:33,713
is your own business.

398
00:21:33,739 --> 00:21:34,940
If you want to study,

399
00:21:35,339 --> 00:21:36,339
you'll surely remember it.

400
00:21:36,339 --> 00:21:37,259
If you don't want to study,

401
00:21:37,259 --> 00:21:38,499
no matter how I test you,

402
00:21:39,259 --> 00:21:40,739
you'll forget anyway.

403
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,039
Hurry up, get that.

404
00:21:42,499 --> 00:21:43,660
Yes, we're waiting for you.

405
00:21:44,499 --> 00:21:44,979
Thanks.

406
00:21:44,979 --> 00:21:45,580
Be careful. It's hot.

407
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,099
It's hot.

408
00:21:50,099 --> 00:21:51,619
I was wondering why

409
00:21:51,619 --> 00:21:52,580
you were so happy just now.

410
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,859
So, you're eating glutinous rice balls.

411
00:21:55,099 --> 00:21:55,859
Eat it while it's hot.

412
00:21:59,619 --> 00:22:01,339
We were talking about
the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday.

413
00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:04,955
Today,

414
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,040
we happened to have a meal together

415
00:22:07,379 --> 00:22:09,339
before the festive season.

416
00:22:09,979 --> 00:22:11,180
So, let me wish all of you

417
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,499
have a joyful holiday in advance.

418
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:15,660
Happy holidays.

419
00:22:16,379 --> 00:22:17,259
Happy holidays.

420
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,619
Tomorrow,

421
00:22:20,099 --> 00:22:21,420
all of us will go home.

422
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,040
When you're on your way home,

423
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,240
please take care of your safety.

424
00:22:26,787 --> 00:22:28,147
The most important thing is

425
00:22:28,355 --> 00:22:30,235
don't forget about your homework.

426
00:22:31,139 --> 00:22:32,259
We'll remember that.

427
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:32,859
We'll remember that.

428
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,459
Mr. Ren, Mr. Qiu.

429
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,459
Happy holidays!

430
00:22:38,979 --> 00:22:39,739
You've become sensible.

431
00:22:39,739 --> 00:22:40,739
They've become sensible.

432
00:22:40,739 --> 00:22:41,219
That's right.

433
00:22:41,219 --> 00:22:42,379
Thank you!

434
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:43,859
Eat it while it's hot.

435
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,379
Why must we have holidays?

436
00:22:50,859 --> 00:22:52,859
We're doing good.
Why must we have holidays?

437
00:22:52,859 --> 00:22:53,979
Isn't this nice?

438
00:22:54,315 --> 00:22:56,259
If you go back home during the holiday,

439
00:22:56,259 --> 00:22:57,259
where should I go?

440
00:22:58,979 --> 00:23:00,654
How did you spend

441
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,520
your previous Mid-Autumn Festivals then?

442
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,379
Working.

443
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,459
Working.

444
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,600
I can earn one or two thousand
a day during the festive season.

445
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,540
The salary is three times
higher than usual at this period.

446
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,979
I'm definitely going to make money.

447
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:14,180
If...

448
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,560
If all of you are going back home,

449
00:23:17,859 --> 00:23:18,900
where should I go?

450
00:23:20,739 --> 00:23:21,859
Come to my house during the holiday.

451
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,060
Go to your house?

452
00:23:29,249 --> 00:23:29,900
That's right.

453
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,320
Come to my house.

454
00:23:38,739 --> 00:23:40,099
That's not good.

455
00:23:46,979 --> 00:23:47,900
I'll give you some glutinous rice balls.

456
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,761
Here, Mr. Ren.
Some glutinous rice balls for you.

457
00:23:57,789 --> 00:24:02,301
(The autumnal equinox refers not only
to the equal length of day and night,

458
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,519
but also the one splitting
the Chinese solar terms of autumn.)

459
00:24:07,545 --> 00:24:10,674
(The autumnal equinox was once
a traditional feast of the moon.）

460
00:24:11,414 --> 00:24:12,541
(The Mid-Autumn Festival evolved

461
00:24:12,566 --> 00:24:14,440
from the "feast of the moon
during autumn twilight".)

462
00:24:19,723 --> 00:24:21,073
(Autumnal Equinox)

463
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,827
Dad! I'm going to school today.

464
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,233
I'm about to submit my PhD thesis.

465
00:24:39,259 --> 00:24:40,219
I need to do some literature research.

466
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,139
Bring along Tou Tou.

467
00:24:45,259 --> 00:24:46,580
I'm not going.

468
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,499
I'm on holiday.

469
00:24:47,499 --> 00:24:49,219
And Meng Meng has gone back home.

470
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,601
I'm not going to the library.

471
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,360
Everyone else can have a holiday

472
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:53,540
but you.

473
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:55,532
Your foundation is too weak.

474
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,640
You must make up
your weakness with hard work.

475
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,799
I'll drive the car here then.

476
00:25:03,651 --> 00:25:05,139
I've arranged for you

477
00:25:05,165 --> 00:25:06,366
to recite the classics every day.

478
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,199
You must stick around
even when you're on holiday.

479
00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:10,340
Every night at eight o'clock,

480
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,681
I'll be waiting for you
in the study on time.

481
00:25:16,219 --> 00:25:17,420
If that's the case,

482
00:25:17,625 --> 00:25:19,739
what's the difference
between having a holiday or not?

483
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,720
Holidays are arranged by humans.

484
00:25:24,099 --> 00:25:25,580
In the eyes of God,

485
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,139
a holiday is about studying.

486
00:25:27,323 --> 00:25:28,683
Studying is on holiday.

487
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:29,780
When I was young,

488
00:25:30,012 --> 00:25:31,132
I only studied during the holidays.

489
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,200
I had to do farming on the usual days.

490
00:25:34,067 --> 00:25:34,859
Go and get a change.

491
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:37,540
Let me watch for another five minutes.

492
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:38,804
I'll go after watching this episode.

493
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,760
Go now.

494
00:26:25,979 --> 00:26:26,739
When we're
out of the neighborhood,

495
00:26:26,739 --> 00:26:27,619
your holiday will start.

496
00:26:27,875 --> 00:26:29,115
Go wherever you want

497
00:26:29,141 --> 00:26:30,061
and do whatever you want.

498
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,440
We'll fix a time and come home together.

499
00:26:33,332 --> 00:26:34,339
What do you mean?

500
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:36,668
We're not going to the library?

501
00:26:37,459 --> 00:26:37,934
I'm going.

502
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,840
You don't like to study, right?

503
00:26:38,859 --> 00:26:39,540
You don't have to go.

504
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,499
I have to go.

505
00:26:41,259 --> 00:26:43,619
Studying will make your dad happy.

506
00:26:43,831 --> 00:26:44,780
When your dad is happy,

507
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:45,979
your family will be happy.

508
00:26:55,107 --> 00:26:56,027
I have other things to do.

509
00:26:56,053 --> 00:26:56,934
Go play by yourself.

510
00:27:07,099 --> 00:27:08,020
Ren Tian Zhen.

511
00:27:09,379 --> 00:27:10,820
You've changed.

512
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,399
You're dishonest now. You're lying.

513
00:27:13,499 --> 00:27:15,020
You want to go out
and have fun, don't you?

514
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,020
But you lie to your dad and say

515
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,139
you are going to the library.

516
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:17,960
Am I right?

517
00:27:18,619 --> 00:27:19,660
Your dad said this.

518
00:27:19,859 --> 00:27:20,979
"Sincerity is the way of Heaven."

519
00:27:20,979 --> 00:27:22,339
"Making oneself sincere
is the way of man."

520
00:27:22,455 --> 00:27:23,859
You are lying to your family now.

521
00:27:23,859 --> 00:27:25,139
Why have you become like this?

522
00:27:25,339 --> 00:27:25,859
Tell me!

523
00:27:26,259 --> 00:27:27,099
Who are you meeting?

524
00:27:27,739 --> 00:27:29,139
I'm going to meet my classmate.

525
00:27:29,139 --> 00:27:30,580
You don't know him. You want to go?

526
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,459
I'll go. Why shouldn't I?

527
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,881
I will know him when I go there.

528
00:27:35,139 --> 00:27:36,139
Which classmate?

529
00:27:37,979 --> 00:27:38,940
I can take you there.

530
00:27:39,465 --> 00:27:40,379
But promise me.

531
00:27:40,379 --> 00:27:41,053
You can't spill the bean

532
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:42,099
on today's matter.

533
00:27:42,099 --> 00:27:42,900
Okay.

534
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,420
Besides that,

535
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:46,139
consider this another
skateboarding class.

536
00:27:48,259 --> 00:27:48,820
Okay?

537
00:27:49,379 --> 00:27:50,020
Get in the car.

538
00:28:21,575 --> 00:28:23,599
(Ren Tian Zhen's Secret Operations)

539
00:28:45,379 --> 00:28:46,139
Ren Tian Zhen.

540
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,321
Do you really want to play this?

541
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,800
It's dangerous.

542
00:28:50,859 --> 00:28:51,739
Dangerous?

543
00:28:51,739 --> 00:28:52,499
There are more exciting

544
00:28:52,499 --> 00:28:53,459
and dangerous ones.

545
00:28:54,411 --> 00:28:55,331
There are more?

546
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,360
Let's go. Let's fly. Let's feel it.

547
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,160
It's okay. I don't play this.

548
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,060
Don't be so polite. Let's go.

549
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,979
No, I don't play this.

550
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,441
You are fearless.

551
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,319
You should feel this child's game.

552
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,020
Listen.

553
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,580
It's good that I could come with you.

554
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,360
You're too polite.

555
00:29:13,379 --> 00:29:14,259
I'm not going!

556
00:29:17,979 --> 00:29:18,459
Okay.

557
00:29:19,004 --> 00:29:21,114
I'll fly now.

558
00:29:21,979 --> 00:29:22,859
Don't be anxious.

559
00:29:22,859 --> 00:29:24,219
Take a stroll on this mountain.

560
00:29:24,699 --> 00:29:26,660
I hope to see you
down the mountain tonight.

561
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,240
Goodbye.

562
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,641
You're really going to do that?

563
00:29:36,339 --> 00:29:37,700
Ren Tian Zhen!

564
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,520
Ren Tian Zhen!

565
00:29:56,499 --> 00:29:58,339
Where are we having dinner tonight?

566
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:18,164
(Ren Tian Zhen's Secret Operations)

567
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,200
You're tired already?

568
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,859
I thought you only play

569
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,280
games like skateboarding.

570
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,859
I didn't expect you to play

571
00:31:22,859 --> 00:31:23,540
such exciting games too.

572
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:24,379
This is nothing.

573
00:31:24,379 --> 00:31:26,180
I still have many difficult challenges

574
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,099
which I haven't completed yet.

575
00:31:27,859 --> 00:31:28,739
What else?

576
00:31:34,739 --> 00:31:35,379
Look. What is this?

577
00:31:38,099 --> 00:31:40,540
Did you put your
bank card's password on this?

578
00:31:40,979 --> 00:31:41,660
You're cheesy.

579
00:31:43,052 --> 00:31:44,499
Except for the bank card's password,

580
00:31:44,499 --> 00:31:46,379
what else is worth taking with you?

581
00:31:46,379 --> 00:31:46,979
Tell me.

582
00:31:47,435 --> 00:31:49,956
Something unreachable

583
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,020
and hard to get.

584
00:31:56,739 --> 00:31:57,420
Ren Tian Zhen.

585
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,559
Let me ask you a question.

586
00:32:00,739 --> 00:32:01,619
Is it illegal

587
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:02,700
to speak human language in your house?

588
00:32:03,804 --> 00:32:04,739
Just give a simple answer

589
00:32:04,739 --> 00:32:06,106
when I ask a question.

590
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,760
Why must you say something

591
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:08,739
that I don't understand?

592
00:32:08,969 --> 00:32:11,259
This here. Look at this blank space.

593
00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:13,339
Is it a semi-finished product?

594
00:32:16,572 --> 00:32:17,972
This is my list of challenges.

595
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,739
Every time I complete a challenge,

596
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,900
I'll carve the latitude
and longitude of that place on it.

597
00:32:22,139 --> 00:32:24,060
It's a kind of record and certification

598
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,060
of my self-challenge.

599
00:32:25,619 --> 00:32:26,099
Look.

600
00:32:27,219 --> 00:32:27,780
Skiing.

601
00:32:29,139 --> 00:32:29,700
Skydiving.

602
00:32:31,379 --> 00:32:31,900
Diving.

603
00:32:32,619 --> 00:32:32,979
Okay, okay.

604
00:32:32,979 --> 00:32:33,379
Rock climbing.

605
00:32:33,379 --> 00:32:34,660
Okay, okay.

606
00:32:35,139 --> 00:32:36,540
So, what do you have left to accomplish?

607
00:32:39,219 --> 00:32:40,499
My next plan

608
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,319
is to do all those things
in the country.

609
00:32:43,379 --> 00:32:44,139
I'm going to do bungee jumping

610
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:45,339
at Shiyan.

611
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,259
In a sense,

612
00:32:48,259 --> 00:32:49,940
jumping off in that way

613
00:32:49,966 --> 00:32:52,366
is probably the closest
you can get to ascending.

614
00:32:55,099 --> 00:32:56,339
I envy you.

615
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,600
Well, this is how rich kids are.

616
00:33:00,499 --> 00:33:01,739
It's such a deadly thing,

617
00:33:01,739 --> 00:33:03,420
but you sounded like it's aspiring.

618
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,680
You envy me, and I envy you too.

619
00:33:09,379 --> 00:33:10,739
Why do you envy me?

620
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,159
I'm the only child in my family.

621
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,759
Countless pairs of eyes in my family

622
00:33:18,219 --> 00:33:20,219
keep staring at me

623
00:33:20,219 --> 00:33:21,499
from the moment I was born.

624
00:33:21,859 --> 00:33:22,979
They are afraid that
something will happen to me

625
00:33:22,979 --> 00:33:23,900
if I'm not being careful.

626
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,880
But I do feel for them.

627
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,840
And I understand them now.

628
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,700
The way you enjoy the games

629
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,601
might really cost your life.

630
00:33:47,699 --> 00:33:48,339
That is why

631
00:33:48,875 --> 00:33:50,235
having parents is good,

632
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,240
but not having parents
is not as miserable as you say.

633
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,240
My life belongs to my family.

634
00:33:56,155 --> 00:33:57,516
Your life belongs to you.

635
00:33:58,115 --> 00:33:58,676
How nice it is.

636
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,339
Come, let's play for another two rounds.

637
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:15,619
You reminded me just now.

638
00:34:15,619 --> 00:34:17,020
I was rootless before.

639
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,099
But I have it now.

640
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:22,259
I am the successor of
the Jiang family's acupuncture sect.

641
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:24,339
If something happens to me,

642
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:26,180
the acupuncture sect will be over.

643
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:27,940
So, my life is very precious now.

644
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:28,920
I want to cherish it.

645
00:34:30,339 --> 00:34:31,700
I can't care much about your sect.

646
00:34:31,726 --> 00:34:33,245
But I want to protect my sect.

647
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:34,780
Just you go.

648
00:34:35,619 --> 00:34:36,060
Okay.

649
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:39,779
Successor, you must protect yourself.

650
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,099
Take it easy!

651
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:45,219
Don't worry.

652
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,960
This is not the way to go back home.

653
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,339
The most important trip
hasn't started yet.

654
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,300
We're not going back yet?

655
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,520
We have to go back now.

656
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,180
I still haven't do
the calligraphy exercise.

657
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,499
If your dad checks my homework tonight,

658
00:35:28,499 --> 00:35:29,859
I'm sure I'll be dead.

659
00:35:30,139 --> 00:35:31,020
There's enough time to do it.

660
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,901
There's not enough time to do it!

661
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,140
What are you going to buy at this place?

662
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:56,219
You'll find out later.

663
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,320
Mr. Ren.

664
00:36:02,588 --> 00:36:03,429
I haven't seen you for a long time.

665
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,640
What good things did you bring today?

666
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:08,653
Take a look.

667
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,521
You know
if this thing I wore is real or fake.

668
00:36:12,547 --> 00:36:14,386
And you know
the price of the good agarwood now.

669
00:36:14,571 --> 00:36:16,692
I can say
there is no price for this piece.

670
00:36:18,572 --> 00:36:19,772
It's a good stuff.

671
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,681
But it has your birth date on it.

672
00:36:22,356 --> 00:36:23,116
You also know

673
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,467
those who wear agarwood pendants
are for own or family protection.

674
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,681
Not very good to offer.

675
00:36:27,037 --> 00:36:27,636
Quote a price.

676
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,040
How about this?

677
00:36:29,332 --> 00:36:29,971
One time offer.

678
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:30,739
One hundred thousand.

679
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:31,480
One hundred...

680
00:36:32,259 --> 00:36:33,380
One hundred thousand?

681
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:38,860
What is this

682
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,259
that costs one hundred thousand?

683
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:42,140
I didn't know you were wearing

684
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,441
such an expensive thing.

685
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:44,760
Deal.

686
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:45,520
Okay.

687
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,580
How much is your watch?

688
00:36:52,699 --> 00:36:53,259
Let me see.

689
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:54,499
The watch...

690
00:36:54,499 --> 00:36:55,020
Watch...

691
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:56,419
What are you doing?

692
00:36:56,419 --> 00:36:57,979
I'm checking
what other valuable things you have.

693
00:36:57,979 --> 00:36:58,820
Don't touch me.

694
00:36:58,820 --> 00:36:59,380
Take it out.

695
00:36:59,380 --> 00:36:59,899
Let's keep a distance.

696
00:36:59,899 --> 00:37:00,739
Man and woman
shouldn't touch each other.

697
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:01,580
Take it out.

698
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:07,620
You lost it?

699
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,480
You lost it?

700
00:37:12,492 --> 00:37:14,838
Is it something that can be lost?

701
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,259
Think about it.

702
00:37:16,659 --> 00:37:18,680
Did you leave it in the library?

703
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,399
That's right.

704
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:20,979
I'll call Head Librarian Wang

705
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,081
and ask him to find it.

706
00:37:22,499 --> 00:37:23,259
Mom, no need for that.

707
00:37:23,499 --> 00:37:24,140
It's the festive season.

708
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,300
He is celebrating with his family too.

709
00:37:25,499 --> 00:37:27,020
Let's call him
after the festive season, okay?

710
00:37:27,046 --> 00:37:27,903
That's not okay.

711
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,159
It's such an important stuff.

712
00:37:30,499 --> 00:37:31,140
I'll call him.

713
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,380
Mom, don't bother about this.

714
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:32,899
Don't need to call him.

715
00:37:33,179 --> 00:37:34,540
Go and find it at the library.

716
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,760
Don't make your grandma worry.

717
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,979
Maybe it's not in the library.

718
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,560
Moreover, you gave me this.

719
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:44,699
It's not that I want to wear it.

720
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,080
Why blame me when I lost it?

721
00:37:46,474 --> 00:37:48,973
Moreover, the string doesn't know that
the pendant is expensive.

722
00:37:48,999 --> 00:37:50,380
I couldn't help it either

723
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,200
since the string broke.

724
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,920
This isn't the first time though.

725
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,259
The string has broken?

726
00:37:56,739 --> 00:37:57,699
That's true.

727
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,040
I changed twice before.

728
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,200
It's all my fault.

729
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:02,860
I haven't changed it for a long time.

730
00:38:02,886 --> 00:38:04,646
Mom, how can we blame you?

731
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,459
Hundreds of thousands are gone.

732
00:38:11,699 --> 00:38:13,620
Hundreds of thousands?

733
00:38:15,781 --> 00:38:17,461
It's been so long.

734
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,459
The pendant should be valuable now.

735
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,020
Head Librarian Wang.

736
00:38:28,979 --> 00:38:30,459
Yes, yes. It's me.

737
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:33,739
I'd like to ask you something.

738
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,300
What a guy.

739
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,020
It's so expensive.

740
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:40,580
If I had known about it,
I would have brought it back.

741
00:38:41,499 --> 00:38:42,140
What did you say?

742
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:46,659
You would have brought it back?

743
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:49,910
No.

744
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,721
I mean,

745
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,499
I should have

746
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,499
searched properly in the library

747
00:38:56,499 --> 00:38:57,739
since it's expensive stuff.

748
00:39:26,179 --> 00:39:26,820
What are you doing?

749
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:30,739
I'm making one for Tian Zhen.

750
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:34,459
Our grandchildren
will have his own blessings.

751
00:39:34,699 --> 00:39:36,820
He doesn't take that thing seriously,

752
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:37,899
so don't bother yourself with this.

753
00:39:37,899 --> 00:39:38,380
Never mind.

754
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:40,020
That can't be.

755
00:39:41,185 --> 00:39:43,300
He is the only child in our family.

756
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,300
We have to protect him.

757
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:48,299
I've lost count of it.

758
00:39:48,476 --> 00:39:50,236
Since he was young,

759
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,359
I wonder why

760
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:56,179
those things that I gave him

761
00:39:56,508 --> 00:39:58,427
all didn't last long.

762
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,639
Either he lost it

763
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,001
or someone stole it.

764
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,480
If this continues,

765
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,119
what should we do?

766
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,681
We'll do what we should do.

767
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,201
Since he was young,

768
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:09,419
he lost a lot of the amulets.

769
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,761
Yet he grew up safely.

770
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,481
We are old now.

771
00:40:16,556 --> 00:40:19,051
We'll just keep these things with us.

772
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,320
Don't do it for him.

773
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:21,959
I know.

774
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,340
The pendant that he lost this time,

775
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,000
we must get it back.

776
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:28,140
But

777
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,120
my mom told me before.

778
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,280
The son of a prestigious family
has a short life.

779
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,639
He'll need something to suppress it.

780
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:42,580
It's getting more expensive.

781
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:05,739
Why are you here?

782
00:41:08,979 --> 00:41:09,739
Sun Tou Tou.

783
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:10,300
I'm...

784
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:14,100
I'm sitting here for a while.

785
00:41:21,459 --> 00:41:23,060
You two have made a deal, right?

786
00:41:26,663 --> 00:41:27,540
Professor Song.

787
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,961
I'm sorry I'm late.

788
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,540
How much did you pay for my son's stuff?

789
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:33,140
One hundred thousand.

790
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,080
One...

791
00:41:36,788 --> 00:41:37,867
You know about it?

792
00:41:43,764 --> 00:41:44,685
What does this mean?

793
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:50,939
You've sold it?

794
00:41:52,356 --> 00:41:53,757
We have always been doing this.

795
00:41:53,915 --> 00:41:55,595
He comes to sell stuff
and I come to redeem it.

796
00:41:55,796 --> 00:41:57,205
Why did you sell it?

797
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,919
Yesterday, I went out for a drink.

798
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:01,540
I left the store to my staff.

799
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:03,060
He accidentally...

800
00:42:03,121 --> 00:42:03,899
He...

801
00:42:03,899 --> 00:42:05,860
I think you don't want
to do our business anymore.

802
00:42:06,812 --> 00:42:08,812
Do you know this is called
embezzlement of assets?

803
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,321
It's hard for me too.

804
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:12,801
I've scolded him all morning.

805
00:42:12,899 --> 00:42:13,499
I...

806
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:14,259
Who did he sell it to?

807
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:15,259
Go and find that person.

808
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,040
The thing is

809
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,401
I don't know who he sold to.

810
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,399
He is not a regular customer.

811
00:42:23,739 --> 00:42:24,580
What about your surveillance camera?

812
00:42:25,275 --> 00:42:26,115
It's already broken.

813
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,040
It's just decoration.

814
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,263
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

815
00:42:38,288 --> 00:42:39,992

traditional Chinese medicine books)
