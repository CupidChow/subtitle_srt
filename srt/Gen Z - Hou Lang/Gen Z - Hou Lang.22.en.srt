1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,956
It's been some time since I saw you.

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:07,840
Ms Meng

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,000
is pregnant.

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,440
Really?

5
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,477
The two-child or three-child policy
is the trend nowadays.

6
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,840
Our government is providing
plenty of benefits to them.

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,520
Ms Meng always wanted a child.

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,757
Now, she's finally pregnant.

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:18,997
-Yeah.
-It's great news.

10
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,080
What are you doing here?

11
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,877
Tomorrow's the weekend.

12
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:24,760
I was thinking

13
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,557
that I would bring Le Le back with me

14
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,520
and let him spend the weekend with us.

15
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,600
Do you remember the wrong date?

16
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,237
Le Le will only head

17
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,037
to his father's place next week.

18
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,720
I'll send him there by then.

19
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,117
It's just a difference of date.

20
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,477
It's not a big deal

21
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,800
if I bring it forward by one week.

22
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,400
The court gave me custody of Le Le.

23
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,520
And, they also designated time
for his father to visit him.

24
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:47,997
Besides, I've never forbidden

25
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,640
you guys from visiting Le Le, right?

26
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,480
But you see,

27
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,317
you came here today to pick the child up

28
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,840
without notifying me.

29
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,840
I don't think I can accept that.

30
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:58,917
Besides, we already made arrangements

31
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,080
for this weekend.

32
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,560
My baby!

33
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,800
Granny.

34
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:03,920
Come here.

35
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,040
-Do you miss me?
-Granny.

36
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,917
Granny, I miss you so much.

37
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,957
I miss you too.

38
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,080
Look at what I've brought for you.

39
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,557
I brought your favourite snack.

40
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,840
Oh yeah,
I brought yogurt for you too.

41
00:01:14,924 --> 00:01:15,833
Yogurt.

42
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,840
You must be thirsty.
Let's go.

43
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,560
Le Le, do you like visiting
Granny's house?

44
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,520
Le Le.

45
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,840
Do you like it or not?

46
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,557
I missed you.

47
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,560
-What are you looking at?
-Le Le.

48
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,840
Le Le.

49
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,160
Have you forgotten

50
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,317
our promise with Ms Jian Xi?

51
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,880
She's going to visit us this weekend.

52
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,477
If you go to Granny's place,

53
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,760
we'll be standing her up.

54
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,157
We should be honest

55
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,920
and trustworthy, right?

56
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,080
Le Le,

57
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,797
Long and Yan Yan

58
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,600
will be coming to our house
this weekend.

59
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,317
Didn't you say you missed them?

60
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,037
You love to play with them, right?

61
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,597
Your father even ordered

62
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,957
kids' set meals for you all.

63
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,320
There will be many big sisters
playing games with you guys.

64
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,720
We have a huge castle

65
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,800
and Disney characters too.

66
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,880
Mum, I wish to see
my brothers and sisters.

67
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,837
I'll play with Ms Jian Xi next week.

68
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,760
Goodbye, Mum.

69
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,200
Let's go.

70
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,360
Le Le.

71
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,837
Promise me then.

72
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,040
You have to be a good boy
when you go to Granny's place.

73
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,480
Don't cause trouble, okay?

74
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,960
I promise.

75
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,720
Please look after him then.

76
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,800
Please send him back by Sunday night.

77
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,360
He has school on Monday.

78
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,000
Alright. Don't worry.

79
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,157
-Let's go.
-Okay.

80
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,357
Let's go.

81
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,800
Let's go.

(Quan,)

84
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,040
tell me something.

85
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,440
How much

86
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,440
do you earn per month?

87
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,960
Mum,

88
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,200
I started working not long ago.

89
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,480
I don't earn that much.

90
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,560
(That's why I don't have
a lot of savings.)

91
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,080
(It's like this.)

92
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,320
(There was a cold spell
during late spring.)

93
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,397
(Half of our fry
were dead.)

94
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,840
(Our investment went down the drain.)

95
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,360
Your younger brother will be attending

96
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,720
junior high this year.

97
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,760
We need to support him too.

98
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,040
Mum,

99
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,920
I understand now.

100
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,480
Dad,

101
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,717
I'll save up all the money I earn

102
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,840
and send it back to you.

103
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,880
(Dad, Mum,)

104
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,000
I didn't save up much this year.

105
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,480
But I prepared red packets for you two.

106
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,720
Happy Chinese New Year, Dad.

107
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,320
Happy Chinese New Year, Mum.

108
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,920
That's all you have?

109
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,720
So, a doctor doesn't earn much, huh?

110
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,200
Why are you sitting here alone
while pulling a long face?

111
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,960
It's nothing.

112
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:03,917
Nothing?

113
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,997
I could tell you were troubled.

114
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:05,917
Tell me.

115
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,560
Even if I tell you, you can't do
anything about it.

116
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,600
How would you know
without telling me in the first place?

117
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,480
It's about my future.

118
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,160
I stopped looking for other jobs

119
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,000
after I joined the apprentice class.

120
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,640
I never expected the apprentice class
to face suspension.

121
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,397
I'll cease to be a fresh graduate
by the end of this year.

122
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,360
It'll be tough for me to get a job.

123
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,520
It's not as serious as you think.

124
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,720
When one door shuts, another opens.

125
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,600
Yeah, it opens for you.

126
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,000
Not for me.

127
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,360
You don't understand how I feel
when you're not in my shoes.

128
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,720
(Qibo Medical Centre)

129
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,080
Let me do it.

130
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,320
It's fine. We can do it together.

131
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,600
Ms Dong,

132
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,197
I assume you've heard about the issue

133
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,160
our apprentice class is facing.

134
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,960
Mr Ren told me about it.

135
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,080
Great things take time.

136
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:12,960
Mr Ren

137
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,877
is trying to contribute to our nation
and its people here.

138
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,240
He's not doing it for his sake.

139
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,400
The apprentice class

140
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,840
will be fine.

141
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,640
You're making the apprentice class

142
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,480
sound like a noble thing.

143
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,077
It may look

144
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,800
insignificant now.

145
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,800
However, it'll affect

146
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,560
the entire environment in the future.

147
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,320
What do you mean?

148
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,680
You see,

149
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,000
Mr Ren

150
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,597
graduated from a professional course

151
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,120
and got himself a mentor too.

152
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,080
He held this class

153
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,477
in hopes

154
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,280
that people can be more aware
of their health

155
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,837
and learn

156
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,600
how to care for their wellness.

157
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,680
Don't you think

158
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,520
he's contributing to the nation
and its people here?

159
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,920
At least it can help people
to save on medical insurance.

160
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,437
Don't panic.

161
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,080
There will surely be a solution to this.

162
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,320
I realise

163
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,400
that you're calmer than Mr Ren.

164
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,080
It's because I know

165
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,600
God is testing him

166
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,437
whether he has enough determination

167
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,200
to proceed with this.

168
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,520
Once he overcomes these obstacles,

169
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,520
he'll be able to overcome all of them.

170
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,917
And, there will surely be someone

171
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,280
who will help him on his journey.

172
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,637
Ms Dong, I'm not

173
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,160
as optimistic as you.

174
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,880
Ms Dong,

175
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,920
I've studied TCM

176
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,600
for over a year now.

177
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,437
I know the teachers who taught us

178
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,520
are amazing.

179
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,600
However,

180
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,000
I only understood the meaning of life

181
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,000
after learning from you.

182
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,760
I also saved people with
the techniques you taught.

183
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:48,957
I don't know about the others,

184
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,920
but I know

185
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,080
it's time

186
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,160
for me to do this.

187
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,800
That's why I wish

188
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,600
you can take me in

189
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,880
as your disciple

190
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,640
so that I can learn techniques from you.

191
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,437
Even if the apprentice class
is cancelled,

192
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,960
I can come here every day

193
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,320
and learn from you.

194
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,637
I believe that I have

195
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,920
strong learning capabilities.

196
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,280
I'm sure I can inherit your techniques

197
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,120
if I work hard enough.

198
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,440
What about the rest of
your classmates then?

199
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,080
That's on them.

200
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,840
Everyone has their own destiny.

201
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,680
Since you're saying that,

202
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,000
that means

203
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,957
you're not ready

204
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,160
to be my disciple yet.

205
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,000
I can't take you in.

206
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,920
But why?

207
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,880
It doesn't feel right.

208
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,920
Ms Dong,

209
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,120
you once said

210
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,400
that feeling is the core
of your techniques.

211
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,640
Senior Master also said

212
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,920
that the most important part
in learning TCM

213
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,360
is to follow your feeling
and travel with the flow.

214
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,800
However, what does "feeling" mean?

215
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,080
You know this. I'm a rational person.

216
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,760
To me,

217
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,480
it's something mysterious
and untouchable.

218
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,840
Have you been in love before?

219
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,040
To be honest, no.

220
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,600
I think falling in love

221
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,360
is a waste of my energy and time.

222
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,760
And, it also impedes me from improving.

223
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,560
Initially, I plan to stay single
for the rest of my life.

224
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,000
But now, I'm willing to get married

225
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,280
in order to get a child.

226
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,680
The "feeling" we mention,

227
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,400
it refers to Hexagram 31, Conjoining,
from the Book of Changes.

228
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,760
All beings are born from the conjoining
of Heaven and Earth.

229
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,280
It refers to the moments
when young boys and girls

230
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,360
encounter each other.

231
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,080
You've already missed out on

232
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,520
that moment.

233
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:45,920
Therefore,

234
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,400
it's hard for you to imagine
how wonderful it is

235
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,200
for people to spend time

236
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,800
with each other

237
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,320
without any ulterior motives.

238
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,440
You cannot imagine the feelings
I described.

239
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,000
On a human body,

240
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,280
there are Heaven and Earth.

241
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,917
There are peaks and rivers.

242
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,880
There's a galaxy in it.

243
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,160
It's because you blocked off

244
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,840
the path.

245
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,640
You're confusing me

246
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,560
here.

247
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,597
Don't tell me a single woman

248
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,200
cannot study TCM?

249
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,837
Don't tell me a person
who has never been in love

250
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,120
cannot pass down the legacy of TCM?

251
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,840
I just hope

252
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,400
that you can unblock
your path of emotion.

253
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,160
When you do so,

254
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,200
you'll detect people's kindness.

255
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,080
Sometimes,

256
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,800
it's not just other people's kindness

257
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,880
that can touch your heart.

258
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,120
It might be their appreciation

259
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,520
for the peaks,

260
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,717
rivers,

261
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,597
flora and fauna.

262
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,637
All these experiences

263
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,440
will make your heart skip a beat

264
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,960
and make you shed tears of joy.

265
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,680
You won't be able to experience them

266
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,000
without unblocking the path of emotion.

267
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,680
This "feeling" we mention,

268
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,480
it's more than just love.

269
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,520
It also refers

270
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,560
to a grateful heart.

271
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,960
Do you know what's gratefulness?

272
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,320
The grace of dripping water should be

273
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,960
reciprocated by a gushing spring.

274
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,120
When people

275
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,240
treat you nicely,

276
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,040
you have to return the favour

277
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,120
instead of just accepting it blindly.

278
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,237
When you can detect

279
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,600
other people's kindness

280
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,640
and reciprocate the act,

281
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,640
you've established

282
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,757
a path of Yin and Yang

283
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,480
that resembles a cycle.

284
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,680
It's the same for my techniques.

285
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,160
First, a patient is a human.

286
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,520
Once you establish

287
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,757
an emotional connection with them,

288
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,917
when you're able

289
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,600
to detect the cycle of Yin and Yang,

290
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,440
only then will you be able to
decode the message

291
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,280
on his body.

292
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,280
When it comes to applying techniques

293
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,680
and being a doctor,

294
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,360
the most important thing

295
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,240
is to devote yourself to the act
from the bottom of your heart.

296
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,720
Love is the strongest power

297
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,000
within the galaxy.

298
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,440
(It's the same for life.)

299
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,440
You only care about
accumulating knowledge.

300
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,520
You don't disperse

301
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,760
or implement your knowledge.

302
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,280
You'll surely be crushed.

303
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,960
In and out,

304
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,637
Yin and Yang,

305
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,680
that is the way.

306
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,040
(When it comes to applying techniques)

307
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,440
(and being a doctor,)

308
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,960
the most important thing

309
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,920
is to devote yourself to the act
from the bottom of your heart.

310
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,880
(Love is the strongest power)

311
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,000
(within the galaxy.)

312
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,800
Cheng Ying, thank you

313
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,280
for taking care of Jian Xi.

314
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,077
Why are you being so courteous?

315
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,560
I'm alone during the weekends anyway.

316
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,200
When she's here,
at least I have someone to talk to.

317
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,040
Now, it's strawberry season.

318
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,437
Ms Song said

319
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,360
strawberries could invigorate
the spleen and nourish the lungs.

320
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,080
Let Le Le eat more of them.

321
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,960
Thank you so much.

322
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,397
You shouldn't be so courteous
in the future.

323
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,957
You always bring things with you
whenever you visit me.

324
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,760
-You're too kind.
-It's what I should do.

325
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,360
I know the medical centre is busy.

326
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,077
But how's the apprentice class?

327
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,600
The medical centre is doing pretty well.

328
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,237
But the apprentice class

329
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,360
is facing a major crisis.

330
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,200
Professor Ren pulls
a long face every day.

331
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,600
Although he never smiled
when he was together with us,

332
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,797
we could feel

333
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,000
that he's in a bad mood this time.

334
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,320
He might be stressed out.

335
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,520
He has to take care
of so many students after all.

336
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,760
If so, I'll wash the strawberries first.

337
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,640
-Le Le isn't back yet?
-Almost.

338
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,880
They said they were on their way.

339
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,720
Who is it?

340
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,877
So, it's our baby.

341
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,117
Our precious boy is back.

342
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,240
Hi, Auntie.

343
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,397
Hi, Le Le. You're so polite.

344
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,360
Le Le.

345
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,640
Hi, Ms Jian Xi.

346
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,237
Le Le.

347
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,517
Ms Jian Xi, look.

348
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,440
I took all of these pictures.

349
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,837
Le Le, you had fun, huh?

350
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,597
Where did Granny take you?

351
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,917
Granny took us to a huge hotel.

352
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,157
There was a huge lawn.

353
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,640
There were swans too.

354
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,280
Le Le,

355
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,600
where did you get this camera?

356
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,440
Auntie Qian Qian gave it to me.

357
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,280
Auntie Qian Qian?

358
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,680
So, Le Le, you attended a wedding?

359
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,157
Look, he wore a suit.

360
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,077
You're so dashing.

361
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,877
Dad married Auntie Qian Qian.

362
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,077
I was their ring bearer.

363
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,320
Granny said I was
the most handsome guy around.

364
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,320
Mum.

365
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:57,440
Le Le.

366
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,560
Didn't you spend the weekend
at Granny's place?

367
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,997
No. Granny took me

368
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,757
to Dad's new house.

369
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,037
He told me and Da Long

370
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,960
to roll around on Dad's bed.

371
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,917
Yue Liang and Yan Yan

372
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,640
aren't living together.

373
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,040
But Granny told me

374
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,797
that my younger sister

375
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,077
was inside Auntie Qian Qian's tummy.

376
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,080
I'll be a big brother soon.

377
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,640
Mum, what's wrong?

378
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,120
Go and wash your hands.

379
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,560
Auntie Zhu Xia bought you
some strawberries.

380
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,040
Go now.

381
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,640
Thank you, Auntie.

382
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,600
You're welcome.

383
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,120
Xia,

384
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,840
I don't think I'll keep you guys around
for dinner tonight.

385
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,480
Let's meet again next week.

386
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,440
You should return with Jian Xi.

387
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,920
Cheng Ying,

388
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,320
are you okay?

389
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,360
I'm fine.

390
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,280
That man is no longer related to me.

391
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,240
Alright. We'll make a move first.

392
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,837
Listen.

393
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,757
That Liu Chang Qing

394
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,200
is truly infuriating.

395
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,000
Tian Zhen almost died

396
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,440
in order

397
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,200
to harvest the rare ginseng.

398
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,600
But now, he's saying
that he can't find it.

399
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,000
How could someone like him exist?

400
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,640
Enough.

401
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,080
Stop complaining about him.

402
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,320
He has no obligations

403
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,160
to help us out.

404
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,840
He did it out of compassion.

405
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,480
No one

406
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,160
expected this to happen.

407
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,160
It must be fate.

408
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,120
I think you're right.

409
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,200
This might be fate.

410
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,640
Maybe fate is telling you
to cancel the apprentice class.

411
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,800
Think about it.

412
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,120
Ever since you started the class,

413
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,920
there were issues

414
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,040
every day.

415
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,680
I think this is pretty good.

416
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,520
We can cancel the apprentice class

417
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,997
and let the students

418
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,080
return to their normal lives.

419
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,000
Master,

420
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,480
Madam,

421
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,880
I must continue

422
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,720
holding the apprentice class.

423
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,560
Maybe fate is telling me

424
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,640
to seek another path.

425
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,880
Please don't worry.

426
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,800
I'll definitely figure out a solution.

427
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,640
Why didn't you notify me
when it was such a huge deal?

428
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,200
Cheng Ying,

429
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,957
what's the matter?

430
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,000
(You told my son)

431
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,360
to be his father's ring bearer
and to roll on his bed.

432
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,440
What gives you the right to do so?

433
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,240
Did you get my permission?

434
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,160
Why did I need your permission?

435
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,157
Besides, didn't I tell you

436
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,397
that I was going to bring Le Le home

437
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,397
so that we could spend
the weekend together?

438
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,880
But you didn't tell me

439
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,880
that you were bringing him
to attend his father's wedding.

440
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,160
(It makes no difference.)

441
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,117
Besides,

442
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,677
you found out, right?

443
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,957
(We didn't notify you)

444
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,880
(because we were afraid
that you might be infuriated.)

445
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,600
Look at how you're responding to it.

446
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,560
This is bad for your health.

447
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,800
Do you think you could get away with it
just because you didn't tell me?

448
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,277
Listen up.

449
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,640
From now on,
you'll never get to see your grandson.

450
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,080
What do you mean by that?

451
00:17:17,253 --> 00:17:18,579
You're strange.

452
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,917
Le Le is my grandson.

453
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,917
I can see him whenever I like.

454
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,600
Why are you stopping me now?

455
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,040
You guys better stop crossing the line.

456
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,157
Your son was the one who betrayed me

457
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,680
and our family first.

458
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,280
(Cheng Ying,)

459
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,077
(I know my son had let you down.)

460
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,240
(But now,)

461
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,237
(we have given you the house)

462
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,840
and our money.

463
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,117
You even got custody of my grandson.

464
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,360
(Now, my son has a new family.)

465
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,600
(Cheng Ying,)

466
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,997
(you need to learn how to
get over the past.)

467
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:47,957
(You still need)

468
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,520
(to live on.)

469
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:50,880
And, I don't care

470
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,440
if you like my son or not.

471
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,800
Your son

472
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,200
will have a younger sister.

473
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,000
They're a family.

474
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,040
You cannot

475
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,920
deny that fact.

476
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,560
Fine.

477
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,920
Since you're getting
a granddaughter soon,

478
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,000
you can treat it as if
you don't have a grandson.

479
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,160
(From now on,)

480
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,437
the Feng family

481
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,000
should stay away from my son.

482
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,360
I won't allow you guys to approach him.

483
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,960
And, listen.

484
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,517
My son is the sole child of the family.

485
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,437
He doesn't have a younger sister

486
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,960
when I say so!

487
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,440
This...

488
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,160
She must've lost her mind.

489
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,160
Hello?

490
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,520
Hello, Le Le's Mum.

491
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,120
I have something to tell you.

492
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,400
From now on,

493
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,040
no one else

494
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,757
is allowed to pick Le Le up

495
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,920
except for me.

496
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,517
Not even his father

497
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,400
or his grandmother?

498
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,440
They picked Le Le up before.

499
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,760
(Especially them.)

500
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:11,880
If I find out

501
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,000
that they take my son away,

502
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,000
I'll call the cops on them.

503
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,757
You see, our kindergarten

504
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,640
cannot make that call.

505
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,360
Why don't you two talk this over?

506
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,517
(You guys should sign an agreement)

507
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,717
(that states that only his mother)

508
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,637
can pick him up.

509
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,957
You have to provide us
with written evidence

510
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,437
before we can follow your instructions,

511
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,400
don't you think so?

512
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,320
Ms Zhang,

513
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,040
you're a woman too.

514
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,880
How could you side with them?

515
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,517
(You misunderstood me.)

516
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,960
(I'm not siding with anyone here.)

517
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,637
I just think

518
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,597
that our kindergarten

519
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,760
cannot make the call here.

520
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,717
You see,

521
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,037
(why don't you)

522
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:49,997
(discuss it)

523
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,120
(with his father again?)

524
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,757
(We shouldn't let the conflicts
between adults)

525
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,120
(affect the kids, don't you think so?)

526
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,040
Hello?

527
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,640
Hello?

528
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,440
-Sell the house?
-Sell the house?

529
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,160
Yes.

530
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,800
I wish to sell the house.

531
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,117
Once I have cash in hand,

532
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,640
I can hold the apprentice class
like normal.

533
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,877
Which house are you selling?

534
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,157
Where did you get the house?

535
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,240
It's our house.

536
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,120
Our house?

537
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,877
You didn't pay a single cent

538
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,080
from its purchase

539
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,200
to its renovation.

540
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,880
How dare you say
that you want to sell it?

541
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,360
I give him my permission.

542
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:57,960
I did fork out the sum.

543
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,837
That's useless.

544
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,720
Your name isn't on
the property ownership certificate.

545
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,600
Ling Lan,

546
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,800
you mustn't be so narrow-minded.

547
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,440
Your husband, which is my student,

548
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,840
will achieve something phenomenal.

549
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,000
We're his

550
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,480
assistants.

551
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:20,357
In the future, if he manages
to raise great students

552
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,560
and if his name goes down in history,

553
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,037
your name

554
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,440
will also go down in history

555
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,640
as you're his wife.

556
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,840
Tell me then.

557
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,037
Confucius's name

558
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,200
goes down in history, right?

559
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,840
Do you know

560
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,160
the name of his wife?

561
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,840
He had 3,000 disciples, you know?

562
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,200
He didn't have one.

563
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,280
He was divorced.

564
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,880
I guess he got divorced
after selling the house.

565
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,160
Times have changed.

566
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,000
Now, the apprentice class

567
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,840
is facing a crisis.

568
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,117
I can't just let my class

569
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,277
be disbanded

570
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,520
after putting in so much effort
to bring them together.

571
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,560
Even so, you can't just
think about the apprentice class.

572
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,280
What about our son?

573
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,877
Our son is at the age

574
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,597
when he should get married.

575
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,557
Tell me then.

576
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,517
Which lady

577
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,437
is willing

578
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,440
to get married into

579
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,117
a family

580
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,520
that doesn't even own a house?

581
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,197
Tian Zhen has
a great family inheritance.

582
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,237
We've provided him

583
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,517
with quality education.

584
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,560
However, if he's sponging off
his parents just to seek a partner,

585
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,120
he can

586
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,360
forget about getting married then.

587
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,680
Ling Lan is right.

588
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,120
Your son is a grown-up now.

589
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,920
He'll definitely care about his dignity.

590
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,720
We can't just

591
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,680
live without a house.

592
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,600
Now, you're siding with
the right person.

593
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,520
If so, he can sell my house.

594
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,040
Dad!

595
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,800
Only my name and your mother's name
are on the property ownership certificate.

596
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,920
I'm giving him my permission.

597
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,200
You have nothing to complain about now.

598
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,400
I...

599
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,757
Mum.

600
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,760
He's the head

601
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,160
of the family.

602
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,160
Yang leads while Yin follows.

603
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,520
I make small decisions

604
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,560
while your father makes
important decisions.

605
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,157
The three of you are over 200 years old

606
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,397
combined.

607
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,480
How could you guys be so wilful?

608
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,877
Think about it.

609
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,157
Where should we stay

610
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,160
if we sell this house?

611
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,077
Your disciple is staying with us too.

612
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,240
Where will she stay then?

613
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,120
We won't live on the streets.

614
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,680
When we were young,

615
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,200
your mother, me,

616
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,640
Master,

617
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:38,917
our parents,

618
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,197
and our siblings,

619
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,160
the ten of us

620
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,440
lived in a 30 meter-square house.

621
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,960
Even so, we managed to pull through.

622
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:47,640
Ling Lan,

623
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:48,917
you have it

624
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,520
too easy.

625
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,440
You're unlike your mother at all.

626
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,600
Your mother

627
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,760
is a dauntless woman.

628
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,640
She can cope with both happy days

629
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,800
and unhappy days.

630
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,840
When it comes to that,

631
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,520
Xin Zheng,

632
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,200
your wife is

633
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,680
inferior to mine.

634
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,000
Why don't you divorce me?

635
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,000
What are you saying?

636
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,640
Get me the property
ownership certificate.

637
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,840
Mum.

638
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,000
Mum, are you serious?

639
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,800
Of course.

640
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,080
Master,

641
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,040
I'm sorry.

642
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,720
Although I'm passing down

643
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,080
our legacy,

644
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,640
you still have

645
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,560
to bear responsibility for my decisions.

646
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,040
That's not true.

647
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,040
It's a test.

648
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,480
Our ancestors are in the sky.

649
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,520
They're observing us.

650
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,560
They want to see how determined we are

651
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,800
to pass down our legacy
to the next generation.

652
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,040
The current society

653
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,480
is too impatient.

654
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,320
They rush everything.

655
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,000
Speed is of the essence.

656
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,840
Just look at our community.

657
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,917
There are three real estate agencies

658
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,800
and four smartphone shops.

659
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,480
However, we're the only ones

660
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,160
who open a medical centre.

661
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,880
We operate it for two decades.

662
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,680
And,

663
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,800
we do our best in
nurturing future talents.

664
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,720
It takes ten years to nurture a tree,

665
00:25:28,804 --> 00:25:30,020
but a hundred years to train a man.

666
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,200
I'll be 100 years old soon.

667
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,560
I'm going to impart everything I have

668
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,080
to you.

669
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,477
Just focus on your mission

670
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,720
and pass down our legacy.

671
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,320
Thank you, Master.

672
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,000
Alright.

673
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,000
Dear,

674
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,400
don't panic.

675
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,080
We're capable people.

676
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,240
We can make money

677
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,400
whenever we like.

678
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,600
When do you feel like making money then?

679
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,800
Do you think I don't want

680
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,960
to pass down the legacy of TCM?

681
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:15,877
Do you think I don't want

682
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,000
to continue holding
the apprentice class?

683
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,880
I don't agree with your decision
to sell the house

684
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,357
because I think

685
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,997
it's wrong

686
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,400
from the start.

687
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,960
Think about it.

688
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,960
You're a renowned figure in society.

689
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,760
And, you're leading such a poor life

690
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,637
at this age.

691
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,680
What do you think your students
will think about you?

692
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,240
Do you think any good talents
will come to you?

693
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,600
Those who are sensible

694
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,120
will learn how to invest
from Warren Buffett instead.

695
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,677
99% of his fortune

696
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,957
are made

697
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,920
after the age of 60.

698
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,280
Dear,

699
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,317
we have to take the righteous path.

700
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,800
Only then, the way of the world
will be preserved.

701
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,997
We need to be friends with time.

702
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,760
We have to be able
to withstand loneliness.

703
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,360
As doctors,

704
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:15,240
we can't just work to make a living.

705
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,160
If there's a talented student

706
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,517
who wishes to take the path
to quick riches,

707
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,560
I will

708
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,040
never take him under my wing.

709
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,080
People who wish to study TCM

710
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,000
must be focused wholeheartedly.

711
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,640
They see that I'm having a rough time.

712
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,760
Even so,

713
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,120
they don't leave me.

714
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,000
That's what you call a great student.

715
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,800
For those who know that Warren
Buffett has tens of billions of dollars

716
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,637
but never know

717
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,317
that he's donated his fortune,

718
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,197
I'm sure they won't be able
to master the art of investment.

719
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,400
If they come
to study TCM under me,

720
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,720
I'll reject them.

721
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,640
That's right.

722
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,160
We should learn from farmers.

723
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,360
For farmers,

724
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,360
it's no pain, no gain.

725
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,840
Sometimes, they might not gain

726
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,400
even after experiencing pain.

727
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,120
Even so, they still do their work.

728
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,800
That's the way of Heaven.

729
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,280
That's the path we need to take.

730
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,000
Coming.

731
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,437
I heard that women

732
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,640
are good at stashing money away.

733
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,240
Didn't you buy other houses in secret?

734
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,840
Honest people like me
don't do such things.

735
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,720
Wait.

736
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,160
Are you sure about that?

737
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,720
Is this the only house you own?

738
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,720
Master, Madam,

739
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,440
I cannot take your house.

740
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,320
I was just joking with you.

741
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,200
Humans only take up five feet
when they lie down.

742
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,760
Five feet is enough for us.

743
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,440
Ling Lan,

744
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,840
you can provide for me when I grow old.

745
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,597
Of course she'll provide for you.

746
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,720
What nonsense are you saying?

747
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,760
Give it to me.

748
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,720
No, I won't.

749
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,760
He can provide for you.

750
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,360
Thank you, Master,

751
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:14,760
Madam.

752
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,520
Are you sure you don't blame me for it?

753
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,240
Your daughter chose her husband herself.

754
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,240
And, you chose our successor yourself.

755
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,160
Now, both of you are my family.

756
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,480
I'll submit to fate.

757
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,360
A bet is a bet.

758
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,760
Aren't you afraid

759
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,440
that I might be wrong about him?

760
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,957
It's not like Xin Zheng is going

761
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,320
to indulge in worldly pleasures
with the money.

762
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,360
He's going to hold a class.

763
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,280
Sometimes,

764
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,517
they fail.

765
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,920
Sometimes, they succeed.

766
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,600
It has nothing to do with his character.

767
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,840
However,

768
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,280
it has everything to do
with his capability.

769
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,280
Aren't you worried

770
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,880
about his capability?

771
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,440
Let me ask you this then.

772
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,320
What does a TCM practitioner treat?

773
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,240
Of course it's illnesses.

774
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,160
To think that you're a renowned
TCM practitioner.

775
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,360
It's people.

776
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,720
I wasn't wrong about you

777
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,600
when I was young,

778
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,080
let alone now.

779
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,480
Listen.

780
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,800
Xin Zheng

781
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,680
will achieve something phenomenal.

782
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,640
He'll be the next guru of our era.

783
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,517
You should say that

784
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,880
to your daughter

785
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,120
so that she won't

786
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,720
give my disciple a hard time.

787
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,200
No, I won't.

788
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,877
But why?

789
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,000
Do you like it when they argue?

790
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,000
A man who cannot withstand

791
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,920
his wife's petty behaviour

792
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,680
cannot achieve success.

793
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,280
I believe in Xin Zheng.

794
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,120
Moreover,

795
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,000
society is much crueler

796
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,120
than his wife.

797
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,040
Aren't you embarrassed?

798
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,080
You're still sponging off
the elders at this age.

799
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,040
I have no choice.

800
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,800
I'm not that capable myself.

801
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,600
Sell my house then.

802
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,997
Return my parents' house to them.

803
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:03,960
No.

804
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,800
Are you trying to go against me?

805
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,840
If I sell their house,

806
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,840
Master and Madam

807
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,600
won't make things difficult for me.

808
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,240
But if I sell your house,

809
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,520
you'll make things difficult for me
every day.

810
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,760
I was going to do that anyway.

811
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,520
This doesn't make any difference.

812
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,600
Give it to me.

813
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,680
Thank you!

814
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,477
Thank you!

815
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,480
Thank you!

816
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,840
Thank you!

817
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,677
You should return
the property ownership certificate

818
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,080
to Master.

819
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,437
I don't want him to find out this early.

820
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,786
I'm going to tease him for a few days.

821
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,160
I'll give you a suggestion.

822
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,800
You should treat me better.

823
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,677
You see,

824
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,760
I'm a renowned figure too.

825
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,837
I have millions of fans

826
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,920
on Wei.

827
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,560
And, I have plenty of female disciples.

828
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,160
You shouldn't feel threatened by them.

829
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,640
Say that again?

830
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,600
I'm just worried that you might
lose your sense of security.

831
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,320
Is there any female disciple

832
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,560
who will sell her house for you
so that you can sustain the class?

833
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,877
If so, please tell me immediately.

834
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,197
I'll pack you up

835
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,197
and send you

836
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,080
to her with no hesitations.

837
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,800
I'll even fork out the delivery fee.

838
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,880
And,

839
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,680
the goods are non-refundable.

840
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,000
The delivery fee is pretty expensive,
you know?

841
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,480
I can at least afford that.

842
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:09,800
(As the temperature rises,
the snow melts.)

843
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:16,240
(Rain gradually increases. This solar
term is known as Rain Water.)

844
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:23,200
(On such days, married daughters
usually visit their parents.)

845
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,840

00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,280
(Qibo Medical Centre)

847
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,240
-Here.
-Thank you.

848
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,680
Tian Zhen,

849
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,837
Professor Ren has been
staring at that map

850
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,240
for a few days.

851
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,000
Even now, he hasn't found a place yet.

852
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,800
That shouldn't be the case.

853
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,517
Professor Ren

854
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,437
is a famous physician.

855
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,837
I'm sure he has a lot of

856
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,840
local connections.

857
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,237
If he makes a call,

858
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,080
I'm sure everyone else will answer it.

859
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,280
Ms Xia, you have no idea.

860
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,997
My father and Senior Uncle

861
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,320
take two different paths.

862
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,637
He doesn't like to
entertain rich people.

863
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,597
He always leaves them

864
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,600
to Senior Uncle.

865
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,600
He only treats the poor.

866
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,320
He cannot seek help from the rich

867
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,520
as they're not close to him.

868
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,080
He cannot seek help from the poor

869
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:48,797
as he can't bear to beg them.

870
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,800
In the end,

871
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,240
it's all Liu Chang Qing's fault.

872
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:53,880
When I think about it...

873
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,160
Zhu Xia,

874
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,360
another two students from the
apprentice class have applied for leave.

875
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,757
If so, we have to rearrange

876
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,720
the schedule then.

877
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,200
Yeah.

878
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,360
A lot of them have applied
for leave lately.

879
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,200
I think we need to hire a professional

880
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,760
to brew herbal remedies.

881
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,840
We should.

882
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,960
We can't just expect our students
to do it all.

883
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,920
I'll leave this to you then.

884
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,200
Don't worry.

885
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,560
Meng Meng, what are you doing?

886
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,040
I'm washing Tou Tou.

887
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,080
-Zhao.
-Ms Xia.

888
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,360
You won't leave, right?

889
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:37,797
Even if we're going to
recruit new people,

890
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,360
we won't be able to get them
to work immediately.

891
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,160
Since you're a professional,

892
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,920
you mustn't leave us, okay?

893
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,040
Ms Xia, the others are
only applying for leave

894
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,600
as they have other
opportunities out there.

895
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,317
You should stay here

896
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,237
and work for us.

897
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,160
It's pretty good here.

898
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,520
You see,

899
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,077
you can join your mentors
during consultations sessions

900
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,120
after three to five years.

901
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,800
After that, you can do your rounds

902
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,080
as a physician
after another three to five years.

903
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,960
By then,

904
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,917
you would be the best

905
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
at your field.

906
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,880
You would be recognised
for your capability.

907
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,600
Ms Xia,

908
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,000
although that's the case,

909
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,440
life is

910
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,520
unpredictable.

911
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,477
You see,

912
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,557
if the medical centre couldn't find

913
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,240
another pharmacist as good as me,

914
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,317
I might have to work here

915
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,600
for the rest of my life.

916
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:25,080
But you see, I have a
Physician's Practice License.

917
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,400
Am I right?

918
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,800
You'll be worse than me then.

919
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,557
I can travel the world

920
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,720
and treat patients

921
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,640
after five years.

922
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,800
Successor, you're the best indeed.

923
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,640
We have different backgrounds.
Life is different for all of us.

924
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,480
It's tough for everyone.

927
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,920
Stop looking around.
I'm the only one here.

928
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,440
Let go of me.

929
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,040
Let me show you something. Come with me.

Help!

00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:27,960
Calm down!

935
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,280
You!

936
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,317
How could you fall out with me
just like that?

937
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,000
-Stop.
-I'm here to deliver this treasure.

938
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,357
Why are you biting the hand
that feeds you?

939
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,960
Stop! Quiet down!

940
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,837
I thought you already changed your ways?

941
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,280
Why are you so violent today?

942
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,720
I promise

943
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,800
I won't kill you today.

944
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,240
Zhao Li Quan.

945
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,720
It's your turn.

946
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,160
Meng Meng, go ahead.

947
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,120
Go now.

948
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,400
Seems like there's a fungal infection
in your lungs.

949
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:32,997
Look, it has already spread

950
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,200
until here.

951
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,840
Why are you only here now?

952
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,920
I've been taking anti-fungal treatments

953
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,680
overseas

954
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,160
for over two years.

955
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,200
It keeps coming back.

956
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,320
At first,

957
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,760
they gave me Voriconazole.

958
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,480
But I couldn't stand it.

959
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,720
I threw up whenever
they gave me the shot.

960
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,400
You threw up?

961
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,360
Yes.

962
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,320
After that, they changed
my prescription.

963
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,680
They gave me medicine to take orally.

964
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,120
I took it for over a month.

965
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:09,800
But it wasn't

966
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:11,440
too effective.

967
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,117
I've taken so many medications

968
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,400
to date.

969
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,360
Now, the doctors suggest me

970
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,240
to go for surgery.

971
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,520
I wish to give it another try.

972
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,760
That's why

973
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,720
I flew across the globe

974
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,000
to seek you out.

975
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,680
How did you hear about me?

976
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,600
I read

977
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:36,840
Learning TCM, which was written by you.

978
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:37,960
It contains cases

979
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,080
similar to mine.

980
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:42,680
They had the same condition.

981
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,760
And, you treated them.

982
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,560
That's why I came to seek you out.

983
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,400
Madam Ba Li.

984
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,720
My surname is Bai.

985
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,440
My name is Jasmine.

986
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,520
(Bai Mo Li)
You can call me Mo Li (Jasmine).

987
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,437
Mo Li?

988
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,560
That's right.

989
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,400
Bai Mo Li, huh?

990
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,680
Just like jasmine flowers.

991
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,597
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

992
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,997

traditional Chinese medicine books)
