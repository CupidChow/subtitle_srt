00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,835
(Episode 22)

3
00:01:40,055 --> 00:01:41,856
It's been some time since I saw you.

4
00:01:42,095 --> 00:01:42,896
Ms Meng

5
00:01:43,135 --> 00:01:44,046
is pregnant.

6
00:01:44,726 --> 00:01:45,560
Really?

7
00:01:45,576 --> 00:01:47,616
The two-child or three-child policy
is the trend nowadays.

8
00:01:47,616 --> 00:01:48,896
Our government is providing
plenty of benefits to them.

9
00:01:49,536 --> 00:01:51,576
Ms Meng always wanted a child.

10
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:52,896
Now, she's finally pregnant.

11
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:54,135
-Yeah.
-It's great news.

12
00:01:54,135 --> 00:01:55,132
What are you doing here?

13
00:01:57,455 --> 00:01:59,016
Tomorrow's the weekend.

14
00:01:59,016 --> 00:01:59,816
I was thinking

15
00:02:00,096 --> 00:02:01,656
that I would bring Le Le back with me

16
00:02:01,695 --> 00:02:02,578
and let him spend the weekend with us.

17
00:02:03,215 --> 00:02:04,656
Do you remember the wrong date?

18
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,281
Le Le will only head

19
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:08,176
to his father's place next week.

20
00:02:08,176 --> 00:02:09,775
I'll send him there by then.

21
00:02:10,455 --> 00:02:12,255
It's just a difference of date.

22
00:02:12,255 --> 00:02:13,536
It's not a big deal

23
00:02:13,615 --> 00:02:14,856
if I bring it forward by one week.

24
00:02:17,856 --> 00:02:19,455
The court gave me custody of Le Le.

25
00:02:19,696 --> 00:02:21,575
And, they also designated time
for his father to visit him.

26
00:02:22,216 --> 00:02:23,135
Besides, I've never	forbidden

27
00:02:23,135 --> 00:02:24,696
you guys from visiting Le Le, right?

28
00:02:24,976 --> 00:02:26,536
But you see,

29
00:02:27,135 --> 00:02:28,455
you came here today to pick the child up

30
00:02:28,455 --> 00:02:29,895
without notifying me.

31
00:02:30,656 --> 00:02:31,895
I don't think I can accept that.

32
00:02:32,935 --> 00:02:34,056
Besides, we already made arrangements

33
00:02:34,056 --> 00:02:35,135
for this weekend.

34
00:02:35,415 --> 00:02:36,615
My baby!

35
00:02:36,735 --> 00:02:37,856
Granny.

36
00:02:38,135 --> 00:02:38,976
Come here.

37
00:02:39,736 --> 00:02:41,096
-Do you miss me?
-Granny.

38
00:02:41,535 --> 00:02:43,056
Granny, I miss you so much.

39
00:02:43,056 --> 00:02:44,096
I miss you too.

40
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:46,136
Look at what I've brought for you.

41
00:02:46,255 --> 00:02:47,656
I brought your favourite snack.

42
00:02:47,681 --> 00:02:48,531
Oh yeah,

43
00:02:48,575 --> 00:02:49,895
I brought yogurt for you too.

44
00:02:50,056 --> 00:02:51,136
Yogurt.

45
00:02:51,136 --> 00:02:51,976
You must be thirsty.

46
00:02:52,215 --> 00:02:53,070
Let's go.

47
00:02:53,776 --> 00:02:56,615
Le Le, do you like visiting
Granny's house?

48
00:02:57,615 --> 00:02:58,570
Le Le.

49
00:02:58,776 --> 00:02:59,895
Do you like it or not?

50
00:03:00,456 --> 00:03:01,656
I missed you.

51
00:03:01,696 --> 00:03:02,601
-What are you looking at?
-Le Le.

52
00:03:03,056 --> 00:03:03,890
Le Le.

53
00:03:06,175 --> 00:03:07,215
Have you forgotten

54
00:03:07,776 --> 00:03:09,456
our promise with Ms Jian Xi?

55
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:10,935
She's going to visit us this weekend.

56
00:03:11,215 --> 00:03:12,535
If you go to Granny's place,

57
00:03:12,615 --> 00:03:13,815
we'll be standing her up.

58
00:03:15,046 --> 00:03:16,295
We should be honest

59
00:03:16,295 --> 00:03:17,976
and trustworthy, right?

60
00:03:18,215 --> 00:03:19,132
Le Le,

61
00:03:19,696 --> 00:03:20,935
Long and Yan Yan

62
00:03:20,935 --> 00:03:22,656
will be coming to our house
this weekend.

63
00:03:22,815 --> 00:03:24,456
Didn't you say you missed them?

64
00:03:24,456 --> 00:03:26,175
You love to play with them, right?

65
00:03:26,175 --> 00:03:27,736
Your father even ordered

66
00:03:27,736 --> 00:03:29,096
kids' set meals for you all.

67
00:03:29,096 --> 00:03:31,376
There will be many big sisters
playing games with you guys.

68
00:03:31,895 --> 00:03:32,765
We have a huge castle

69
00:03:33,016 --> 00:03:33,875
and Disney characters too.

70
00:03:36,456 --> 00:03:38,935
Mum, I wish to see
my brothers and sisters.

71
00:03:39,056 --> 00:03:40,976
I'll play with Ms Jian Xi next week.

72
00:03:40,976 --> 00:03:41,828
Goodbye, Mum.

73
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:43,255
Let's go.

74
00:03:43,455 --> 00:03:44,406
Le Le.

75
00:03:47,856 --> 00:03:48,976
Promise me then.

76
00:03:48,976 --> 00:03:51,095
You have to be a good boy
when you go to Granny's place.

77
00:03:51,216 --> 00:03:52,535
Don't cause trouble, okay?

78
00:03:54,095 --> 00:03:55,015
I promise.

79
00:03:57,496 --> 00:03:58,776
Please look after him then.

80
00:03:59,015 --> 00:04:00,856
Please send him back by Sunday night.

81
00:04:01,015 --> 00:04:02,416
He has school on Monday.

82
00:04:02,696 --> 00:04:04,056
Alright. Don't worry.

83
00:04:05,056 --> 00:04:06,296
-Let's go.
-Okay.

84
00:04:06,296 --> 00:04:07,496
Let's go.

85
00:04:07,496 --> 00:04:08,856
Let's go.

(Quan,)

88
00:04:27,895 --> 00:04:29,095
tell me something.

89
00:04:29,576 --> 00:04:30,496
How much

90
00:04:30,976 --> 00:04:32,496
do you earn per month?

91
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,031
Mum,

92
00:04:35,175 --> 00:04:36,255
I started working not long ago.

93
00:04:36,815 --> 00:04:38,535
I don't earn that much.

94
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:40,615
(That's why I don't have
a lot of savings.)

95
00:04:41,336 --> 00:04:42,136
(It's like this.)

96
00:04:42,856 --> 00:04:44,375
(There was a cold spell
during late spring.)

97
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:45,375
(Half of our fry)

98
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:46,535
(were dead.)

99
00:04:46,535 --> 00:04:47,895
(Our investment went down the drain.)

100
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:49,416
Your younger brother will be attending

101
00:04:50,175 --> 00:04:51,776
junior high this year.

102
00:04:52,136 --> 00:04:53,815
We need to support him too.

103
00:04:55,216 --> 00:04:56,101
Mum,

104
00:04:57,015 --> 00:04:57,984
I understand now.

105
00:04:58,655 --> 00:04:59,539
Dad,

106
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:01,856
I'll save up all the money I earn

107
00:05:01,856 --> 00:05:02,895
and send it back to you.

108
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,926
(Dad, Mum,)

109
00:05:06,535 --> 00:05:08,056
I didn't save up much this year.

110
00:05:09,936 --> 00:05:11,535
But I prepared red packets for you two.

111
00:05:11,976 --> 00:05:12,776
Happy Chinese New Year, Dad.

112
00:05:13,455 --> 00:05:14,375
Happy Chinese New Year, Mum.

113
00:05:18,976 --> 00:05:19,976
That's all you have?

114
00:05:20,655 --> 00:05:21,776
So, a doctor doesn't earn much, huh?

115
00:05:33,336 --> 00:05:35,255
Why are you sitting here alone
while pulling a long face?

116
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:37,015
It's nothing.

117
00:05:38,095 --> 00:05:39,056
Nothing?

118
00:05:39,056 --> 00:05:40,093
I could tell you were troubled.

119
00:05:40,136 --> 00:05:40,960
Tell me.

120
00:05:41,042 --> 00:05:42,602
Even if I tell you, you can't do
anything about it.

121
00:05:43,095 --> 00:05:45,655
How would you know
without telling me in the first place?

122
00:05:46,535 --> 00:05:47,535
It's about my future.

123
00:05:49,576 --> 00:05:51,215
I stopped looking for other jobs

124
00:05:51,495 --> 00:05:53,055
after I joined the apprentice class.

125
00:05:53,616 --> 00:05:55,696
I never expected the apprentice class
to face suspension.

126
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:58,535
I'll cease to be a fresh graduate
by the end of this year.

127
00:05:58,535 --> 00:06:00,416
It'll be tough for me to get a job.

128
00:06:05,296 --> 00:06:06,576
It's not as serious as you think.

129
00:06:06,736 --> 00:06:07,775
When one door shuts, another opens.

130
00:06:13,616 --> 00:06:14,679
Yeah, it opens for you.

131
00:06:16,136 --> 00:06:17,055
Not for me.

132
00:06:18,576 --> 00:06:20,416
You don't understand how I feel
when you're not in my shoes.

(Qibo Medical Centre)

134
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:29,125
Let me do it.

135
00:06:29,896 --> 00:06:31,375
It's fine. We can do it together.

136
00:06:37,696 --> 00:06:38,648
Ms Dong,

137
00:06:39,215 --> 00:06:40,335
I assume you've heard about the issue

138
00:06:40,335 --> 00:06:41,215
our apprentice class is facing.

139
00:06:42,775 --> 00:06:44,016
Mr Ren told me about it.

140
00:06:44,935 --> 00:06:46,136
Great things take time.

141
00:06:47,095 --> 00:06:48,023
Mr Ren

142
00:06:48,935 --> 00:06:51,016
is trying to contribute to our nation
and its people here.

143
00:06:51,016 --> 00:06:52,296
He's not doing it for his sake.

144
00:06:53,495 --> 00:06:54,476
The apprentice class

145
00:06:54,736 --> 00:06:55,896
will be fine.

146
00:06:57,495 --> 00:06:58,696
You're making the apprentice class

147
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,535
sound like a noble thing.

148
00:07:02,215 --> 00:07:03,215
It may look

149
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:04,856
insignificant now.

150
00:07:05,856 --> 00:07:06,875
However, it'll affect

151
00:07:07,095 --> 00:07:08,616
the entire environment in the future.

152
00:07:11,576 --> 00:07:12,375
What do you mean?

153
00:07:12,856 --> 00:07:13,726
You see,

154
00:07:14,136 --> 00:07:15,078
Mr Ren

155
00:07:16,616 --> 00:07:18,736
graduated from a professional course

156
00:07:18,736 --> 00:07:21,160
and got himself a mentor too.

157
00:07:22,055 --> 00:07:23,136
He held this class

158
00:07:23,696 --> 00:07:24,616
in hopes

159
00:07:24,616 --> 00:07:26,335
that people can be more aware
of their health

160
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:27,976
and learn

161
00:07:27,976 --> 00:07:29,655
how to care for their wellness.

162
00:07:29,815 --> 00:07:30,734
Don't you think

163
00:07:31,095 --> 00:07:32,576
he's contributing to the nation
and its people here?

164
00:07:32,815 --> 00:07:34,976
At least it can help people
to save on medical insurance.

165
00:07:35,576 --> 00:07:36,500
Don't panic.

166
00:07:36,576 --> 00:07:38,136
There will surely be a solution to this.

167
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,375
I realise

168
00:07:40,775 --> 00:07:42,456
that you're calmer than Mr Ren.

169
00:07:44,095 --> 00:07:45,136
It's because I know

170
00:07:45,335 --> 00:07:47,655
God is testing him

171
00:07:47,856 --> 00:07:49,576
whether he has enough determination

172
00:07:49,576 --> 00:07:51,255
to proceed with this.

173
00:07:51,896 --> 00:07:53,576
Once he overcomes these obstacles,

174
00:07:54,136 --> 00:07:55,576
he'll be able to overcome all of them.

175
00:07:55,696 --> 00:07:58,055
And, there will surely be someone

176
00:07:58,055 --> 00:07:59,320
who will help him on his journey.

177
00:08:00,655 --> 00:08:01,696
Ms Dong, I'm not

178
00:08:01,775 --> 00:08:03,215
as optimistic as you.

179
00:08:05,935 --> 00:08:06,929
Ms Dong,

180
00:08:08,016 --> 00:08:08,976
I've studied TCM

181
00:08:09,176 --> 00:08:10,655
for over a year now.

182
00:08:11,335 --> 00:08:12,576
I know the teachers who taught us

183
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:13,576
are amazing.

184
00:08:14,736 --> 00:08:15,664
However,

185
00:08:15,856 --> 00:08:17,055
I only understood the meaning of life

186
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:19,055
after learning from you.

187
00:08:19,215 --> 00:08:21,800
I also saved people with
the techniques you taught.

188
00:08:23,176 --> 00:08:24,095
I don't know about the others,

189
00:08:24,095 --> 00:08:24,976
but I know

190
00:08:25,176 --> 00:08:26,136
it's time

191
00:08:26,416 --> 00:08:27,215
for me to do this.

192
00:08:28,016 --> 00:08:28,856
That's why I wish

193
00:08:29,335 --> 00:08:30,655
you can take me in

194
00:08:30,815 --> 00:08:31,935
as your disciple

195
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:33,696
so that I can learn techniques from you.

196
00:08:35,616 --> 00:08:37,576
Even if the apprentice class
is cancelled,

197
00:08:37,576 --> 00:08:39,016
I can come here every day

198
00:08:39,255 --> 00:08:40,375
and learn from you.

199
00:08:40,576 --> 00:08:41,775
I believe that I have

200
00:08:41,775 --> 00:08:42,976
strong learning capabilities.

201
00:08:43,335 --> 00:08:44,335
I'm sure I can inherit your techniques

202
00:08:44,456 --> 00:08:46,176
if I work hard enough.

203
00:08:46,856 --> 00:08:48,495
What about the rest of
your classmates then?

204
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:51,136
That's on them.

205
00:08:51,775 --> 00:08:52,896
Everyone has their own destiny.

206
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:56,736
Since you're saying that,

207
00:08:57,095 --> 00:08:58,055
that means

208
00:08:59,095 --> 00:09:00,095
you're not ready

209
00:09:00,095 --> 00:09:01,215
to be my disciple yet.

210
00:09:01,815 --> 00:09:03,055
I can't take you in.

211
00:09:04,976 --> 00:09:05,984
But why?

212
00:09:06,775 --> 00:09:07,935
It doesn't feel right.

213
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:14,984
Ms Dong,

214
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,176
you once said

215
00:09:17,856 --> 00:09:19,456
that feeling is the core
of your techniques.

216
00:09:20,055 --> 00:09:21,696
Senior Master also said

217
00:09:22,176 --> 00:09:23,976
that the most important part
in learning TCM

218
00:09:24,176 --> 00:09:25,416
is to follow your feeling
and travel with the flow.

219
00:09:26,095 --> 00:09:27,856
However, what does "feeling" mean?

220
00:09:28,456 --> 00:09:30,136
You know this. I'm a rational person.

221
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:31,815
To me,

222
00:09:32,016 --> 00:09:34,535
it's something mysterious
and untouchable.

223
00:09:40,815 --> 00:09:41,896
Have you been in love before?

224
00:09:48,616 --> 00:09:50,095
To be honest, no.

225
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,655
I think falling in love

226
00:09:51,775 --> 00:09:53,416
is a waste of my energy and time.

227
00:09:53,696 --> 00:09:54,815
And, it also impedes me from improving.

228
00:09:55,775 --> 00:09:57,616
Initially, I plan to stay single
for the rest of my life.

229
00:09:57,935 --> 00:09:59,055
But now, I'm willing to get married

230
00:09:59,335 --> 00:10:01,335
in order to get a child.

231
00:10:05,655 --> 00:10:06,736
The "feeling" we mention,

232
00:10:07,335 --> 00:10:09,455
it refers to Hexagram 31, Conjoining,
from the Book of Changes.

233
00:10:10,056 --> 00:10:11,816
All beings are born from the conjoining
of Heaven and Earth.

234
00:10:12,176 --> 00:10:14,335
It refers to the moments
when young boys and girls

235
00:10:14,455 --> 00:10:16,416
encounter each other.

236
00:10:17,176 --> 00:10:18,125
You've already missed out on

237
00:10:18,335 --> 00:10:19,575
that moment.

238
00:10:20,095 --> 00:10:20,968
Therefore,

239
00:10:21,215 --> 00:10:23,455
it's hard for you to imagine
how wonderful it is

240
00:10:23,895 --> 00:10:25,256
for people to spend time

241
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,856
with each other

242
00:10:27,015 --> 00:10:28,376
without any ulterior motives.

243
00:10:28,816 --> 00:10:30,496
You cannot imagine the feelings
I described.

244
00:10:31,015 --> 00:10:32,070
On a human body,

245
00:10:32,496 --> 00:10:33,335
there are Heaven and Earth.

246
00:10:33,695 --> 00:10:35,056
There are peaks and rivers.

247
00:10:35,056 --> 00:10:35,936
There's a galaxy in it.

248
00:10:36,496 --> 00:10:38,215
It's because you blocked off

249
00:10:38,775 --> 00:10:39,895
the path.

250
00:10:40,695 --> 00:10:41,695
You're confusing me

251
00:10:42,135 --> 00:10:43,616
here.

252
00:10:44,736 --> 00:10:45,736
Don't tell me a single woman

253
00:10:45,736 --> 00:10:47,256
cannot study TCM?

254
00:10:48,775 --> 00:10:49,976
Don't tell me a person
who has never been in love

255
00:10:49,976 --> 00:10:51,176
cannot pass down the legacy of TCM?

256
00:10:51,936 --> 00:10:52,895
I just hope

257
00:10:53,496 --> 00:10:55,455
that you can unblock
your path of emotion.

258
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:58,215
When you do so,

259
00:10:58,936 --> 00:11:01,256
you'll detect people's kindness.

260
00:11:01,976 --> 00:11:03,135
Sometimes,

261
00:11:03,535 --> 00:11:04,856
it's not just other people's kindness

262
00:11:05,095 --> 00:11:06,936
that can touch your heart.

263
00:11:07,335 --> 00:11:08,176
It might be their appreciation

264
00:11:08,496 --> 00:11:09,575
for the peaks,

265
00:11:09,936 --> 00:11:10,856
rivers,

266
00:11:10,856 --> 00:11:12,655
flora and fauna.

267
00:11:12,736 --> 00:11:13,687
All these experiences

268
00:11:13,775 --> 00:11:15,496
will make your heart skip a beat

269
00:11:15,695 --> 00:11:17,015
and make you shed tears of joy.

270
00:11:17,455 --> 00:11:18,736
You won't be able to experience them

271
00:11:19,256 --> 00:11:21,056
without unblocking the path of emotion.

272
00:11:22,695 --> 00:11:23,736
This "feeling" we mention,

273
00:11:24,335 --> 00:11:26,535
it's more than just love.

274
00:11:26,695 --> 00:11:27,575
It also refers

275
00:11:28,135 --> 00:11:29,616
to a grateful heart.

276
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,015
Do you know what's gratefulness?

277
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,376
The grace of dripping water should be

278
00:11:34,616 --> 00:11:36,015
reciprocated by a gushing spring.

279
00:11:37,056 --> 00:11:38,176
When people

280
00:11:38,496 --> 00:11:40,296
treat you nicely,

281
00:11:40,535 --> 00:11:42,095
you have to return the favour

282
00:11:42,455 --> 00:11:44,176
instead of just accepting it blindly.

283
00:11:44,335 --> 00:11:45,376
When you can detect

284
00:11:45,376 --> 00:11:46,655
other people's kindness

285
00:11:47,056 --> 00:11:48,695
and reciprocate the act,

286
00:11:49,015 --> 00:11:50,695
you've established

287
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:51,895
a path of Yin and Yang

288
00:11:51,895 --> 00:11:53,535
that resembles a cycle.

289
00:11:53,775 --> 00:11:55,736
It's the same for my techniques.

290
00:11:56,256 --> 00:11:58,215
First, a patient is a human.

291
00:11:58,655 --> 00:11:59,575
Once you establish

292
00:11:59,816 --> 00:12:01,895
an emotional connection with them,

293
00:12:01,895 --> 00:12:03,056
when you're able

294
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,655
to detect the cycle of Yin and Yang,

295
00:12:04,856 --> 00:12:06,496
only then will you be able to
decode the message

296
00:12:06,856 --> 00:12:08,335
on his body.

297
00:12:09,455 --> 00:12:10,335
When it comes to applying techniques

298
00:12:10,856 --> 00:12:11,736
and being a doctor,

299
00:12:12,376 --> 00:12:13,416
the most important thing

300
00:12:13,856 --> 00:12:16,296
is to devote yourself to the act
from the bottom of your heart.

301
00:12:17,455 --> 00:12:19,775
Love is the strongest power

302
00:12:20,616 --> 00:12:22,056
within the galaxy.

303
00:12:42,976 --> 00:12:44,496
(It's the same for life.)

304
00:12:45,256 --> 00:12:47,496
You only care about
accumulating knowledge.

305
00:12:48,376 --> 00:12:49,575
You don't disperse

306
00:12:49,856 --> 00:12:50,816
or implement your knowledge.

307
00:12:52,056 --> 00:12:53,335
You'll surely be crushed.

308
00:12:53,895 --> 00:12:55,015
In and out,

309
00:12:55,736 --> 00:12:56,775
Yin and Yang,

310
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:57,736
that is the way.

311
00:12:59,256 --> 00:13:00,095
(When it comes to applying techniques)

312
00:13:00,695 --> 00:13:01,496
(and being a doctor,)

313
00:13:02,015 --> 00:13:03,015
the most important thing

314
00:13:03,535 --> 00:13:05,976
is to devote yourself to the act
from the bottom of your heart.

315
00:13:06,496 --> 00:13:08,936
(Love is the strongest power)

316
00:13:09,695 --> 00:13:11,056
(within the galaxy.)

317
00:13:42,936 --> 00:13:44,856
Cheng Ying, thank you

318
00:13:44,976 --> 00:13:46,335
for taking care of Jian Xi.

319
00:13:46,936 --> 00:13:48,215
Why are you being so courteous?

320
00:13:48,215 --> 00:13:49,616
I'm alone during the weekends anyway.

321
00:13:49,736 --> 00:13:51,256
When she's here,
at least I have someone to talk to.

322
00:13:51,496 --> 00:13:53,095
Now, it's strawberry season.

323
00:13:53,376 --> 00:13:54,575
Ms Song said

324
00:13:54,575 --> 00:13:56,416
strawberries could invigorate
the spleen and nourish the lungs.

325
00:13:56,816 --> 00:13:58,135
Let Le Le eat more of them.

326
00:13:58,936 --> 00:14:00,015
Thank you so much.

327
00:14:00,296 --> 00:14:01,535
You shouldn't be so courteous
in the future.

328
00:14:01,535 --> 00:14:03,095
You always bring things with you
whenever you visit me.

329
00:14:03,095 --> 00:14:04,816
-You're too kind.
-It's what I should do.

330
00:14:06,856 --> 00:14:08,416
I know the medical centre is busy.

331
00:14:08,775 --> 00:14:10,215
But how's the apprentice class?

332
00:14:10,215 --> 00:14:11,655
The medical centre is doing pretty well.

333
00:14:11,816 --> 00:14:13,376
But the apprentice class

334
00:14:13,376 --> 00:14:14,416
is facing a major crisis.

335
00:14:14,655 --> 00:14:16,256
Professor Ren pulls
a long face every day.

336
00:14:16,816 --> 00:14:18,655
Although he never smiled
when he was together with us,

337
00:14:19,376 --> 00:14:20,936
we could feel

338
00:14:20,936 --> 00:14:22,056
that he's in a bad mood this time.

339
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:24,376
He might be stressed out.

340
00:14:24,695 --> 00:14:26,575
He has to take care
of so many students after all.

341
00:14:27,895 --> 00:14:29,816
If so, I'll wash the strawberries first.

342
00:14:31,056 --> 00:14:32,695
-Le Le isn't back yet?
-Almost.

343
00:14:32,895 --> 00:14:33,936
They said they were on their way.

344
00:14:38,176 --> 00:14:39,775
Who is it?

345
00:14:42,575 --> 00:14:44,015
So, it's our baby.

346
00:14:44,015 --> 00:14:46,256
Our precious boy is back.

347
00:14:46,256 --> 00:14:47,296
Hi, Auntie.

348
00:14:47,455 --> 00:14:48,535
Hi, Le Le. You're so polite.

349
00:14:48,535 --> 00:14:49,414
Le Le.

350
00:14:49,976 --> 00:14:51,695
Hi, Ms Jian Xi.

351
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:53,351
Le Le.

352
00:14:53,376 --> 00:14:54,655
Ms Jian Xi, look.

353
00:14:54,655 --> 00:14:56,496
I took all of these pictures.

354
00:14:57,496 --> 00:14:58,976
Le Le, you had fun, huh?

355
00:14:58,976 --> 00:15:00,736
Where did Granny take you?

356
00:15:00,736 --> 00:15:03,056
Granny took us to a huge hotel.

357
00:15:03,056 --> 00:15:04,296
There was a huge lawn.

358
00:15:04,296 --> 00:15:05,695
There were swans too.

359
00:15:08,455 --> 00:15:09,359
Le Le,

360
00:15:09,455 --> 00:15:10,655
where did you get this camera?

361
00:15:11,496 --> 00:15:13,496
Auntie Qian Qian gave it to me.

362
00:15:14,176 --> 00:15:15,335
Auntie Qian Qian?

363
00:15:17,695 --> 00:15:19,736
So, Le Le, you attended a wedding?

364
00:15:20,496 --> 00:15:22,240
Look, he wore a suit.

365
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,190
You're so dashing.

366
00:15:23,215 --> 00:15:25,015
Dad married Auntie Qian Qian.

367
00:15:25,015 --> 00:15:26,215
I was their ring bearer.

368
00:15:26,215 --> 00:15:28,376
Granny said I was
the most handsome guy around.

369
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:31,398
Mum.

370
00:15:31,575 --> 00:15:32,500
Le Le.

371
00:15:33,936 --> 00:15:35,616
Didn't you spend the weekend
at Granny's place?

372
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,135
No. Granny took me

373
00:15:38,135 --> 00:15:39,895
to Dad's new house.

374
00:15:39,895 --> 00:15:41,176
He told me and Da Long

375
00:15:41,176 --> 00:15:44,015
to roll around on Dad's bed.

376
00:15:44,575 --> 00:15:47,015
Yue Liang and Yan Yan

377
00:15:47,056 --> 00:15:48,695
aren't living together.

378
00:15:48,976 --> 00:15:51,095
But Granny told me

379
00:15:51,256 --> 00:15:52,936
that my younger sister

380
00:15:52,936 --> 00:15:54,215
was inside Auntie Qian Qian's tummy.

381
00:15:54,215 --> 00:15:56,135
I'll be a big brother soon.

382
00:15:58,135 --> 00:15:59,695
Mum, what's wrong?

383
00:16:02,056 --> 00:16:03,176
Go and wash your hands.

384
00:16:04,015 --> 00:16:05,616
Auntie Zhu Xia bought you
some strawberries.

385
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,117
Go now.

386
00:16:07,736 --> 00:16:08,695
Thank you, Auntie.

387
00:16:08,816 --> 00:16:09,671
You're welcome.

388
00:16:10,176 --> 00:16:11,171
Xia,

389
00:16:12,135 --> 00:16:13,895
I don't think I'll keep you guys around
for dinner tonight.

390
00:16:14,455 --> 00:16:15,535
Let's meet again next week.

391
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:17,496
You should return with Jian Xi.

392
00:16:19,015 --> 00:16:19,984
Cheng Ying,

393
00:16:20,335 --> 00:16:21,376
are you okay?

394
00:16:22,535 --> 00:16:23,437
I'm fine.

395
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,335
That man is no longer related to me.

396
00:16:27,095 --> 00:16:28,280
Alright. We'll make a move first.

397
00:16:36,015 --> 00:16:36,976
Listen.

398
00:16:36,976 --> 00:16:37,895
That Liu Chang Qing

399
00:16:37,895 --> 00:16:40,256
is truly infuriating.

400
00:16:41,455 --> 00:16:43,056
Tian Zhen almost died

401
00:16:43,616 --> 00:16:44,515
in order

402
00:16:44,655 --> 00:16:46,256
to harvest the rare ginseng.

403
00:16:47,455 --> 00:16:49,655
But now, he's saying
that he can't find it.

404
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:53,056
How could someone like him exist?

405
00:16:53,655 --> 00:16:54,695
Enough.

406
00:16:55,455 --> 00:16:57,120
Stop complaining about him.

407
00:16:58,256 --> 00:16:59,376
He has no obligations

408
00:16:59,496 --> 00:17:01,215
to help us out.

409
00:17:01,736 --> 00:17:02,895
He did it out of compassion.

410
00:17:03,496 --> 00:17:04,535
No one

411
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:06,215
expected this to happen.

412
00:17:08,256 --> 00:17:09,215
It must be fate.

413
00:17:11,215 --> 00:17:13,176
I think you're right.

414
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:15,256
This might be fate.

415
00:17:15,655 --> 00:17:17,695
Maybe fate is telling you
to cancel the apprentice class.

416
00:17:17,976 --> 00:17:18,856
Think about it.

417
00:17:18,976 --> 00:17:20,176
Ever since you started the class,

418
00:17:21,695 --> 00:17:22,976
there were issues

419
00:17:23,135 --> 00:17:25,095
every day.

420
00:17:25,655 --> 00:17:27,748
I think this is pretty good.

421
00:17:28,135 --> 00:17:29,575
We can cancel the apprentice class

422
00:17:29,695 --> 00:17:31,135
and let the students

423
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,125
return to their normal lives.

424
00:17:33,015 --> 00:17:34,046
Master,

425
00:17:34,616 --> 00:17:35,539
Madam,

426
00:17:35,856 --> 00:17:36,936
I must continue

427
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,775
holding the apprentice class.

428
00:17:40,376 --> 00:17:41,616
Maybe fate is telling me

429
00:17:43,056 --> 00:17:44,695
to seek another path.

430
00:17:45,895 --> 00:17:46,937
Please don't worry.

431
00:17:48,496 --> 00:17:49,856
I'll definitely figure out a solution.

432
00:18:06,816 --> 00:18:08,695
Why didn't you notify me
when it was such a huge deal?

433
00:18:10,392 --> 00:18:11,272
Cheng Ying,

434
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:13,015
what's the matter?

435
00:18:13,095 --> 00:18:14,056
(You told my son)

436
00:18:14,296 --> 00:18:16,416
to be his father's ring bearer
and to roll on his bed.

437
00:18:17,376 --> 00:18:18,496
What gives you the right to do so?

438
00:18:19,135 --> 00:18:20,296
Did you get my permission?

439
00:18:20,496 --> 00:18:22,215
Why did I need your permission?

440
00:18:22,535 --> 00:18:24,296
Besides, didn't I tell you

441
00:18:24,296 --> 00:18:25,535
that I was going to bring Le Le home

442
00:18:25,535 --> 00:18:26,535
so that we could spend
the weekend together?

443
00:18:26,535 --> 00:18:27,936
But you didn't tell me

444
00:18:28,135 --> 00:18:29,936
that you were bringing him
to attend his father's wedding.

445
00:18:31,895 --> 00:18:34,215
(It makes no difference.)

446
00:18:34,335 --> 00:18:35,256
Besides,

447
00:18:35,256 --> 00:18:36,816
you found out, right?

448
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:38,095
(We didn't notify you)

449
00:18:38,095 --> 00:18:39,935
(because we were afraid
that you might be infuriated.)

450
00:18:40,095 --> 00:18:41,656
Look at how you're responding to it.

451
00:18:41,896 --> 00:18:43,616
This is bad for your health.

452
00:18:43,815 --> 00:18:45,856
Do you think you could get away with it
just because you didn't tell me?

453
00:18:46,473 --> 00:18:47,328
Listen up.

454
00:18:47,415 --> 00:18:48,215
From now on,

455
00:18:48,215 --> 00:18:49,695
you'll never get to see your grandson.

456
00:18:50,776 --> 00:18:52,136
What do you mean by that?

457
00:18:52,415 --> 00:18:53,575
You're strange.

458
00:18:53,976 --> 00:18:55,055
Le Le is my grandson.

459
00:18:55,055 --> 00:18:56,055
I can see him whenever I like.

460
00:18:56,055 --> 00:18:57,656
Why are you stopping me now?

461
00:18:59,536 --> 00:19:01,095
You guys better stop crossing the line.

462
00:19:02,175 --> 00:19:03,295
Your son was the one who betrayed me

463
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,736
and our family first.

464
00:19:05,335 --> 00:19:06,335
(Cheng Ying,)

465
00:19:06,935 --> 00:19:09,215
(I know my son had let you down.)

466
00:19:09,215 --> 00:19:10,295
(But now,)

467
00:19:10,496 --> 00:19:12,376
(we have given you the house)

468
00:19:12,376 --> 00:19:13,896
and our money.

469
00:19:14,055 --> 00:19:16,256
You even got custody of my grandson.

470
00:19:16,256 --> 00:19:18,415
(Now, my son has a new family.)

471
00:19:18,656 --> 00:19:19,648
(Cheng Ying,)

472
00:19:19,856 --> 00:19:22,136
(you need to learn how to
get over the past.)

473
00:19:22,136 --> 00:19:23,095
(You still need)

474
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:24,575
(to live on.)

475
00:19:25,095 --> 00:19:25,935
And, I don't care

476
00:19:26,055 --> 00:19:27,496
if you like my son or not.

477
00:19:27,856 --> 00:19:28,856
Your son

478
00:19:29,016 --> 00:19:30,256
will have a younger sister.

479
00:19:30,415 --> 00:19:32,055
They're a family.

480
00:19:32,215 --> 00:19:33,095
You cannot

481
00:19:33,695 --> 00:19:34,976
deny that fact.

482
00:19:35,415 --> 00:19:36,616
Fine.

483
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:39,976
Since you're getting
a granddaughter soon,

484
00:19:40,455 --> 00:19:42,055
you can treat it as if
you don't have a grandson.

485
00:19:42,376 --> 00:19:43,215
(From now on,)

486
00:19:43,376 --> 00:19:44,575
the Feng family

487
00:19:44,575 --> 00:19:46,055
should stay away from my son.

488
00:19:46,575 --> 00:19:48,415
I won't allow you guys to approach him.

489
00:19:48,976 --> 00:19:50,016
And, listen.

490
00:19:50,575 --> 00:19:52,656
My son is the sole child of the family.

491
00:19:52,656 --> 00:19:53,575
He doesn't have a younger sister

492
00:19:53,575 --> 00:19:55,016
when I say so!

493
00:20:04,575 --> 00:20:05,484
This...

494
00:20:07,016 --> 00:20:08,215
She must've lost her mind.

495
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:26,226
Hello?

496
00:20:27,496 --> 00:20:28,575
Hello, Le Le's Mum.

497
00:20:30,376 --> 00:20:32,175
I have something to tell you.

498
00:20:33,496 --> 00:20:34,455
From now on,

499
00:20:35,175 --> 00:20:36,117
no one else

500
00:20:36,896 --> 00:20:37,896
is allowed to pick Le Le up

501
00:20:37,896 --> 00:20:38,976
except for me.

502
00:20:40,455 --> 00:20:41,656
Not even his father

503
00:20:41,656 --> 00:20:42,455
or his grandmother?

504
00:20:42,656 --> 00:20:44,496
They picked Le Le up before.

505
00:20:44,856 --> 00:20:45,820
(Especially them.)

506
00:20:46,095 --> 00:20:46,937
If I find out

507
00:20:47,256 --> 00:20:49,055
that they take my son away,

508
00:20:49,256 --> 00:20:50,078
I'll call the cops on them.

509
00:20:50,695 --> 00:20:51,896
You see, our kindergarten

510
00:20:51,896 --> 00:20:53,695
cannot make that call.

511
00:20:54,016 --> 00:20:56,415
Why don't you two talk this over?

512
00:20:56,616 --> 00:20:58,656
(You guys should sign an agreement)

513
00:20:58,656 --> 00:20:59,856
(that states that only his mother)

514
00:20:59,856 --> 00:21:01,776
can pick him up.

515
00:21:01,776 --> 00:21:03,095
You have to provide us
with written evidence

516
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,575
before we can follow your instructions,

517
00:21:04,575 --> 00:21:05,455
don't you think so?

518
00:21:07,415 --> 00:21:08,376
Ms Zhang,

519
00:21:09,776 --> 00:21:11,095
you're a woman too.

520
00:21:12,055 --> 00:21:13,935
How could you side with them?

521
00:21:14,736 --> 00:21:15,656
(You misunderstood me.)

522
00:21:15,656 --> 00:21:17,016
(I'm not siding with anyone here.)

523
00:21:17,215 --> 00:21:18,776
I just think

524
00:21:18,776 --> 00:21:19,736
that our kindergarten

525
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:20,815
cannot make the call here.

526
00:21:21,856 --> 00:21:22,856
You see,

527
00:21:22,856 --> 00:21:24,175
(why don't you)

528
00:21:24,175 --> 00:21:25,136
(discuss it)

529
00:21:25,136 --> 00:21:26,175
(with his father again?)

530
00:21:26,415 --> 00:21:27,896
(We shouldn't let the conflicts
between adults)

531
00:21:27,896 --> 00:21:29,175
(affect the kids, don't you think so?)

532
00:21:32,136 --> 00:21:33,109
Hello?

533
00:21:33,736 --> 00:21:34,695
Hello?

534
00:22:02,455 --> 00:22:03,496
-Sell the house?
-Sell the house?

535
00:22:04,215 --> 00:22:05,226
Yes.

536
00:22:05,695 --> 00:22:06,856
I wish to sell the house.

537
00:22:07,295 --> 00:22:08,256
Once I have cash in hand,

538
00:22:08,256 --> 00:22:10,695
I can hold the apprentice class
like normal.

539
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:13,016
Which house are you selling?

540
00:22:13,016 --> 00:22:14,295
Where did you get the house?

541
00:22:14,295 --> 00:22:15,295
It's our house.

542
00:22:17,496 --> 00:22:19,175
Our house?

543
00:22:20,295 --> 00:22:22,016
You didn't pay a single cent

544
00:22:22,016 --> 00:22:23,136
from its purchase

545
00:22:23,496 --> 00:22:26,256
to its renovation.

546
00:22:27,136 --> 00:22:28,935
How dare you say
that you want to sell it?

547
00:22:30,536 --> 00:22:31,437
I give him my permission.

548
00:22:32,095 --> 00:22:33,015
I did fork out the sum.

549
00:22:33,976 --> 00:22:34,976
That's useless.

550
00:22:34,976 --> 00:22:36,776
Your name isn't on
the property ownership certificate.

551
00:22:39,736 --> 00:22:40,648
Ling Lan,

552
00:22:41,656 --> 00:22:42,856
you mustn't be so narrow-minded.

553
00:22:44,815 --> 00:22:46,496
Your husband, which is my student,

554
00:22:47,016 --> 00:22:48,896
will achieve something phenomenal.

555
00:22:49,496 --> 00:22:51,055
We're his

556
00:22:51,496 --> 00:22:52,536
assistants.

557
00:22:53,016 --> 00:22:55,496
In the future, if he manages
to raise great students

558
00:22:55,496 --> 00:22:56,616
and if his name goes down in history,

559
00:22:56,815 --> 00:22:58,175
your name

560
00:22:58,175 --> 00:22:59,496
will also go down in history

561
00:22:59,616 --> 00:23:00,695
as you're his wife.

562
00:23:04,016 --> 00:23:04,896
Tell me then.

563
00:23:05,815 --> 00:23:07,175
Confucius's name

564
00:23:07,175 --> 00:23:08,256
goes down in history, right?

565
00:23:09,016 --> 00:23:09,896
Do you know

566
00:23:10,136 --> 00:23:11,215
the name of his wife?

567
00:23:12,175 --> 00:23:13,896
He had 3,000 disciples, you know?

568
00:23:15,335 --> 00:23:16,256
He didn't have one.

569
00:23:17,319 --> 00:23:18,351
He was divorced.

570
00:23:20,295 --> 00:23:21,935
I guess he got divorced
after selling the house.

571
00:23:27,335 --> 00:23:29,215
Times have changed.

572
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:31,055
Now, the apprentice class

573
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:33,896
is facing a crisis.

574
00:23:34,616 --> 00:23:36,256
I can't just let my class

575
00:23:36,256 --> 00:23:37,415
be disbanded

576
00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:38,575
after putting in so much effort
to bring them together.

577
00:23:40,095 --> 00:23:42,616
Even so, you can't just
think about the apprentice class.

578
00:23:42,856 --> 00:23:44,335
What about our son?

579
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:46,016
Our son is at the age

580
00:23:46,016 --> 00:23:47,695
when he should get married.

581
00:23:47,739 --> 00:23:48,632
Tell me then.

582
00:23:48,695 --> 00:23:49,656
Which lady

583
00:23:49,656 --> 00:23:50,575
is willing

584
00:23:50,575 --> 00:23:51,496
to get married into

585
00:23:51,896 --> 00:23:53,256
a family

586
00:23:53,256 --> 00:23:54,575
that doesn't even own a house?

587
00:23:56,415 --> 00:23:58,335
Tian Zhen has
a great family inheritance.

588
00:23:58,335 --> 00:23:59,376
We've provided him

589
00:23:59,376 --> 00:24:00,575
with quality education.

590
00:24:00,656 --> 00:24:02,616
However, if he's sponging off
his parents just to seek a partner,

591
00:24:03,295 --> 00:24:04,171
he can

592
00:24:04,455 --> 00:24:05,415
forget about getting married then.

593
00:24:06,496 --> 00:24:07,736
Ling Lan is right.

594
00:24:08,295 --> 00:24:09,175
Your son is a grown-up now.

595
00:24:09,536 --> 00:24:10,976
He'll definitely care about his dignity.

596
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:12,776
We can't just

597
00:24:13,016 --> 00:24:14,736
live without a house.

598
00:24:17,175 --> 00:24:18,656
Now, you're siding with
the right person.

599
00:24:22,256 --> 00:24:23,575
If so, he can sell my house.

600
00:24:25,136 --> 00:24:26,101
Dad!

601
00:24:27,055 --> 00:24:27,856
Only my name and your mother's name

602
00:24:27,856 --> 00:24:29,856
are on the
property ownership certificate.

603
00:24:30,055 --> 00:24:30,968
I'm giving him my permission.

604
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,256
You have nothing to complain about now.

605
00:24:34,536 --> 00:24:35,468
I...

606
00:24:37,935 --> 00:24:38,812
Mum.

607
00:24:38,896 --> 00:24:39,804
He's the head

608
00:24:40,376 --> 00:24:41,215
of the family.

609
00:24:42,656 --> 00:24:44,215
Yang leads while Yin follows.

610
00:24:44,455 --> 00:24:45,575
I make small decisions

611
00:24:45,776 --> 00:24:47,616
while your father makes
important decisions.

612
00:24:52,896 --> 00:24:54,295
The three of you are over 200 years old

613
00:24:54,295 --> 00:24:55,536
combined.

614
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:57,536
How could you guys be so wilful?

615
00:24:57,695 --> 00:24:59,016
Think about it.

616
00:24:59,016 --> 00:25:00,215
Where should we stay

617
00:25:00,295 --> 00:25:01,215
if we sell this house?

618
00:25:03,215 --> 00:25:04,215
Your disciple is staying with us too.

619
00:25:04,215 --> 00:25:05,295
Where will she stay then?

620
00:25:05,896 --> 00:25:08,175
We won't live on the streets.

621
00:25:08,776 --> 00:25:09,757
When we were young,

622
00:25:10,095 --> 00:25:11,256
your mother, me,

623
00:25:11,656 --> 00:25:12,695
Master,

624
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:14,055
our parents,

625
00:25:14,055 --> 00:25:15,335
and our siblings,

626
00:25:15,335 --> 00:25:16,215
the ten of us

627
00:25:16,736 --> 00:25:18,496
lived in a 30m² house.

628
00:25:18,815 --> 00:25:20,016
Even so, we managed to pull through.

629
00:25:21,815 --> 00:25:22,710
Ling Lan,

630
00:25:23,175 --> 00:25:23,976
you have it

631
00:25:24,055 --> 00:25:25,575
too easy.

632
00:25:26,496 --> 00:25:28,496
You're unlike your mother at all.

633
00:25:30,496 --> 00:25:31,656
Your mother

634
00:25:31,976 --> 00:25:34,815
is a dauntless woman.

635
00:25:35,256 --> 00:25:36,695
She can cope with both happy days

636
00:25:37,575 --> 00:25:39,856
and unhappy days.

637
00:25:40,496 --> 00:25:41,896
When it comes to that,

638
00:25:42,616 --> 00:25:43,575
Xin Zheng,

639
00:25:44,776 --> 00:25:46,256
your wife is

640
00:25:46,935 --> 00:25:48,736
inferior to mine.

641
00:25:52,016 --> 00:25:53,055
Why don't you divorce me?

642
00:25:54,095 --> 00:25:55,054
What are you saying?

643
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,695
Get me the property
ownership certificate.

644
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:01,898
Mum.

645
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:05,055
Mum, are you serious?

646
00:26:05,856 --> 00:26:06,856
Of course.

647
00:26:10,175 --> 00:26:11,125
Master,

648
00:26:12,016 --> 00:26:13,095
I'm sorry.

649
00:26:14,736 --> 00:26:15,776
Although I'm passing down

650
00:26:16,215 --> 00:26:17,136
our legacy,

651
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:19,695
you still have

652
00:26:20,335 --> 00:26:21,616
to bear responsibility for my decisions.

653
00:26:23,215 --> 00:26:24,095
That's not true.

654
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:26,095
It's a test.

655
00:26:27,376 --> 00:26:29,536
Our ancestors are in the sky.

656
00:26:30,536 --> 00:26:31,575
They're observing us.

657
00:26:32,136 --> 00:26:34,616
They want to see how determined we are

658
00:26:34,776 --> 00:26:36,856
to pass down our legacy
to the next generation.

659
00:26:38,616 --> 00:26:40,095
The current society

660
00:26:40,415 --> 00:26:41,536
is too impatient.

661
00:26:42,295 --> 00:26:43,376
They rush everything.

662
00:26:43,736 --> 00:26:45,055
Speed is of the essence.

663
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:46,896
Just look at our community.

664
00:26:47,496 --> 00:26:49,055
There are three real estate agencies

665
00:26:49,055 --> 00:26:50,856
and four smartphone shops.

666
00:26:51,616 --> 00:26:52,554
However, we're the only ones

667
00:26:53,256 --> 00:26:54,215
who open a medical centre.

668
00:26:54,856 --> 00:26:55,935
We operate it for two decades.

669
00:26:56,776 --> 00:26:57,734
And,

670
00:26:58,055 --> 00:27:00,856
we do our best in
nurturing future talents.

671
00:27:02,616 --> 00:27:03,575
It takes ten years to nurture a tree,

672
00:27:03,976 --> 00:27:05,016
but a hundred years to train a man.

673
00:27:05,455 --> 00:27:07,256
I'll be 100 years old soon.

674
00:27:07,896 --> 00:27:09,616
I'm going to impart everything I have

675
00:27:09,976 --> 00:27:11,136
to you.

676
00:27:12,136 --> 00:27:13,616
Just focus on your mission

677
00:27:13,616 --> 00:27:15,776
and pass down our legacy.

678
00:27:18,496 --> 00:27:19,376
Thank you, Master.

679
00:27:24,095 --> 00:27:25,078
Alright.

680
00:27:27,256 --> 00:27:28,055
Dear,

681
00:27:28,455 --> 00:27:29,455
don't panic.

682
00:27:32,536 --> 00:27:34,136
We're capable people.

683
00:27:35,415 --> 00:27:36,295
We can make money

684
00:27:36,575 --> 00:27:37,460
whenever we like.

685
00:27:40,376 --> 00:27:41,656
When do you feel like making money then?

686
00:27:45,856 --> 00:27:46,843
Do you think I don't want

687
00:27:47,256 --> 00:27:49,016
to pass down the legacy of TCM?

688
00:27:50,055 --> 00:27:51,016
Do you think I don't want

689
00:27:51,016 --> 00:27:53,055
to continue holding
the apprentice class?

690
00:27:56,335 --> 00:27:57,935
I don't agree with your decision
to sell the house

691
00:27:58,295 --> 00:27:59,496
because I think

692
00:27:59,496 --> 00:28:01,136
it's wrong

693
00:28:01,136 --> 00:28:02,455
from the start.

694
00:28:02,935 --> 00:28:04,016
Think about it.

695
00:28:04,295 --> 00:28:06,016
You're a renowned figure in society.

696
00:28:06,575 --> 00:28:08,815
And, you're leading such a poor life

697
00:28:09,016 --> 00:28:10,776
at this age.

698
00:28:10,776 --> 00:28:12,736
What do you think your students
will think about you?

699
00:28:13,215 --> 00:28:15,295
Do you think any good talents
will come to you?

700
00:28:16,175 --> 00:28:17,656
Those who are sensible

701
00:28:18,175 --> 00:28:20,175
will learn how to invest
from Warren Buffett instead.

702
00:28:23,335 --> 00:28:24,815
99% of his fortune

703
00:28:24,815 --> 00:28:26,095
are made

704
00:28:26,095 --> 00:28:27,976
after the age of 60.

705
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:32,343
Dear,

706
00:28:33,136 --> 00:28:35,455
we have to take the righteous path.

707
00:28:35,455 --> 00:28:37,856
Only then, the way of the world
will be preserved.

708
00:28:40,215 --> 00:28:42,136
We need to be friends with time.

709
00:28:42,136 --> 00:28:43,815
We have to be able
to withstand loneliness.

710
00:28:44,136 --> 00:28:45,415
As doctors,

711
00:28:46,856 --> 00:28:50,295
we can't just work to make a living.

712
00:28:51,616 --> 00:28:53,215
If there's a talented student

713
00:28:53,776 --> 00:28:55,656
who wishes to take the path
to quick riches,

714
00:28:55,656 --> 00:28:56,601
I will

715
00:28:57,095 --> 00:28:58,101
never take him under my wing.

716
00:28:58,616 --> 00:29:00,136
People who wish to study TCM

717
00:29:00,335 --> 00:29:02,055
must be focused wholeheartedly.

718
00:29:02,455 --> 00:29:04,695
They see that I'm having a rough time.

719
00:29:05,575 --> 00:29:06,815
Even so,

720
00:29:07,215 --> 00:29:08,175
they don't leave me.

721
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:10,055
That's what you call a great student.

722
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:11,215
For those who know

723
00:29:11,215 --> 00:29:13,856
that Warren Buffett has
tens of billions of dollars

724
00:29:14,095 --> 00:29:15,776
but never know

725
00:29:15,776 --> 00:29:17,455
that he's donated his fortune,

726
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:19,335
I'm sure they won't be able
to master the art of investment.

727
00:29:19,335 --> 00:29:20,136
If they come

728
00:29:20,136 --> 00:29:21,455
to study TCM under me,

729
00:29:21,656 --> 00:29:22,776
I'll reject them.

730
00:29:23,776 --> 00:29:24,695
That's right.

731
00:29:26,496 --> 00:29:28,215
We should learn from farmers.

732
00:29:28,536 --> 00:29:29,414
For farmers,

733
00:29:29,536 --> 00:29:32,415
it's no pain, no gain.

734
00:29:32,575 --> 00:29:33,896
Sometimes, they might not gain

735
00:29:34,095 --> 00:29:35,455
even after experiencing pain.

736
00:29:36,376 --> 00:29:38,175
Even so, they still do their work.

737
00:29:38,496 --> 00:29:39,856
That's the way of Heaven.

738
00:29:40,776 --> 00:29:42,335
That's the path we need to take.

739
00:29:45,095 --> 00:29:46,055
Coming.

740
00:29:50,935 --> 00:29:53,575
I heard that women

741
00:29:53,575 --> 00:29:55,695
are good at stashing money away.

742
00:29:55,896 --> 00:29:58,295
Didn't you buy other houses in secret?

743
00:29:59,136 --> 00:30:00,896
Honest people like me
don't do such things.

744
00:30:01,856 --> 00:30:02,781
Wait.

745
00:30:03,095 --> 00:30:04,215
Are you sure about that?

746
00:30:05,376 --> 00:30:06,776
Is this the only house you own?

747
00:30:06,976 --> 00:30:08,776
Master, Madam,

748
00:30:09,856 --> 00:30:11,496
I cannot take your house.

749
00:30:12,896 --> 00:30:14,376
I was just joking with you.

750
00:30:14,776 --> 00:30:16,256
Humans only take up five feet
when they lie down.

751
00:30:16,656 --> 00:30:17,815
Five feet is enough for us.

752
00:30:21,496 --> 00:30:22,492
Ling Lan,

753
00:30:23,335 --> 00:30:24,896
you can provide for me when I grow old.

754
00:30:28,335 --> 00:30:29,736
Of course she'll provide for you.

755
00:30:29,736 --> 00:30:30,776
What nonsense are you saying?

756
00:30:30,896 --> 00:30:31,835
Give it to me.

757
00:30:34,776 --> 00:30:35,776
No, I won't.

758
00:30:37,856 --> 00:30:38,804
He can provide for you.

759
00:30:46,575 --> 00:30:47,437
Thank you, Master,

760
00:30:48,935 --> 00:30:49,835
Madam.

761
00:31:19,415 --> 00:31:20,575
Are you sure you don't blame me for it?

762
00:31:24,935 --> 00:31:27,295
Your daughter chose her husband herself.

763
00:31:27,736 --> 00:31:29,295
And, you chose our successor yourself.

764
00:31:29,976 --> 00:31:32,215
Now, both of you are my family.

765
00:31:32,616 --> 00:31:33,539
I'll submit to fate.

766
00:31:36,415 --> 00:31:37,415
A bet is a bet.

767
00:31:38,935 --> 00:31:39,815
Aren't you afraid

768
00:31:40,455 --> 00:31:41,496
that I might be wrong about him?

769
00:31:42,695 --> 00:31:44,095
It's not like Xin Zheng is going

770
00:31:44,095 --> 00:31:45,376
to indulge in worldly pleasures
with the money.

771
00:31:45,815 --> 00:31:47,415
He's going to hold a class.

772
00:31:48,095 --> 00:31:49,335
Sometimes,

773
00:31:49,455 --> 00:31:50,656
they fail.

774
00:31:50,656 --> 00:31:51,976
Sometimes, they succeed.

775
00:31:52,335 --> 00:31:53,656
It has nothing to do with his character.

776
00:31:54,016 --> 00:31:54,898
However,

777
00:31:55,095 --> 00:31:56,335
it has everything to do
with his capability.

778
00:31:57,335 --> 00:31:58,335
Aren't you worried

779
00:31:58,656 --> 00:31:59,935
about his capability?

780
00:32:00,536 --> 00:32:01,496
Let me ask you this then.

781
00:32:02,376 --> 00:32:04,376
What does a TCM practitioner treat?

782
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:06,296
Of course it's illnesses.

783
00:32:08,415 --> 00:32:10,215
To think that you're a renowned
TCM practitioner.

784
00:32:10,935 --> 00:32:12,415
It's people.

785
00:32:14,455 --> 00:32:15,776
I wasn't wrong about you

786
00:32:16,175 --> 00:32:17,656
when I was young,

787
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:20,136
let alone now.

788
00:32:20,656 --> 00:32:21,536
Listen.

789
00:32:23,935 --> 00:32:24,856
Xin Zheng

790
00:32:25,536 --> 00:32:26,736
will achieve something phenomenal.

791
00:32:27,376 --> 00:32:29,695
He'll be the next guru of our era.

792
00:32:30,536 --> 00:32:31,656
You should say that

793
00:32:31,656 --> 00:32:32,935
to your daughter

794
00:32:33,136 --> 00:32:34,175
so that she won't

795
00:32:34,295 --> 00:32:35,776
give my disciple a hard time.

796
00:32:36,256 --> 00:32:37,250
No, I won't.

797
00:32:38,002 --> 00:32:38,968
But why?

798
00:32:39,016 --> 00:32:41,055
Do you like it when they argue?

799
00:32:41,776 --> 00:32:43,055
A man who cannot withstand

800
00:32:43,736 --> 00:32:44,976
his wife's petty behaviour

801
00:32:45,175 --> 00:32:46,736
cannot achieve success.

802
00:32:47,136 --> 00:32:48,335
I believe in Xin Zheng.

803
00:32:49,295 --> 00:32:50,175
Moreover,

804
00:32:50,896 --> 00:32:52,055
society is much crueller

805
00:32:52,896 --> 00:32:54,175
than his wife.

806
00:33:06,095 --> 00:33:07,095
Aren't you embarrassed?

807
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:10,136
You're still sponging off
the elders at this age.

808
00:33:12,175 --> 00:33:13,093
I have no choice.

809
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:15,856
I'm not that capable myself.

810
00:33:35,736 --> 00:33:36,671
Sell my house then.

811
00:33:37,016 --> 00:33:38,136
Return my parents' house to them.

812
00:33:38,136 --> 00:33:39,023
No.

813
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:40,856
Are you trying to go against me?

814
00:33:48,095 --> 00:33:49,896
If I sell their house,

815
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:51,896
Master and Madam

816
00:33:52,295 --> 00:33:53,656
won't make things difficult for me.

817
00:33:53,935 --> 00:33:55,295
But if I sell your house,

818
00:33:56,215 --> 00:33:58,575
you'll make things difficult for me
every day.

819
00:34:00,776 --> 00:34:02,815
I was going to do that anyway.

820
00:34:03,656 --> 00:34:04,562
This doesn't make any difference.

821
00:34:05,776 --> 00:34:06,679
Give it to me.

822
00:34:13,815 --> 00:34:14,734
Thank you!

823
00:34:15,295 --> 00:34:16,616
Thank you!

824
00:34:16,616 --> 00:34:17,536
Thank you!

825
00:34:18,095 --> 00:34:19,896
Thank you!

826
00:34:21,695 --> 00:34:22,815
You should return
the property ownership certificate

827
00:34:22,815 --> 00:34:24,136
to Master.

828
00:34:26,575 --> 00:34:28,496
I don't want him to find out this early.

829
00:34:28,575 --> 00:34:29,539
I'm going to tease him for a few days.

830
00:34:41,856 --> 00:34:43,215
I'll give you a suggestion.

831
00:34:45,575 --> 00:34:46,856
You should treat me better.

832
00:34:48,776 --> 00:34:49,815
You see,

833
00:34:49,815 --> 00:34:50,815
I'm a renowned figure too.

834
00:34:52,695 --> 00:34:53,976
I have millions of fans

835
00:34:53,976 --> 00:34:54,976
on Weibo.

836
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:58,616
And, I have plenty of female disciples.

837
00:34:58,856 --> 00:35:01,215
You shouldn't feel threatened by them.

838
00:35:03,776 --> 00:35:04,695
Say that again?

839
00:35:09,776 --> 00:35:11,656
I'm just worried that you might
lose your sense of security.

840
00:35:12,295 --> 00:35:13,376
Is there any female disciple

841
00:35:14,175 --> 00:35:16,616
who will sell her house for you
so that you can sustain the class?

842
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:19,016
If so, please tell me immediately.

843
00:35:19,016 --> 00:35:20,335
I'll pack you up

844
00:35:20,335 --> 00:35:21,335
and send you

845
00:35:21,335 --> 00:35:22,136
to her with no hesitations.

846
00:35:22,736 --> 00:35:23,856
I'll even fork out the delivery fee.

847
00:35:24,016 --> 00:35:24,937
And,

848
00:35:25,095 --> 00:35:26,736
the goods are non-refundable.

849
00:35:28,856 --> 00:35:30,055
The delivery fee is pretty expensive,
you know?

850
00:35:32,335 --> 00:35:33,536
I can at least afford that.

851
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:44,851
(As the temperature rises,
the snow melts.)

852
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:51,298
(Rain gradually increases. This solar
term is known as Rain Water.)

853
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:58,278
(On such days, married daughters
usually visit their parents.)

854
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,914
(Rain Water)

855
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,341
(Qibo Medical Centre)

856
00:36:33,096 --> 00:36:34,296
-Here.
-Thank you.

857
00:36:49,855 --> 00:36:50,731
Tian Zhen,

858
00:36:51,175 --> 00:36:52,976
Professor Ren has been
staring at that map

859
00:36:52,976 --> 00:36:54,296
for a few days.

860
00:36:54,776 --> 00:36:56,056
Even now, he hasn't found a place yet.

861
00:36:56,736 --> 00:36:57,855
That shouldn't be the case.

862
00:36:58,736 --> 00:36:59,655
Professor Ren

863
00:36:59,655 --> 00:37:01,576
is a famous physician.

864
00:37:01,576 --> 00:37:02,976
I'm sure he has a lot of

865
00:37:02,976 --> 00:37:03,895
local connections.

866
00:37:04,135 --> 00:37:05,375
If he makes a call,

867
00:37:05,375 --> 00:37:07,135
I'm sure everyone else will answer it.

868
00:37:07,296 --> 00:37:08,336
Ms Xia, you have no idea.

869
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:10,135
My father and Senior Uncle

870
00:37:10,135 --> 00:37:11,375
take two different paths.

871
00:37:11,536 --> 00:37:12,776
He doesn't like to
entertain rich people.

872
00:37:12,776 --> 00:37:13,736
He always leaves them

873
00:37:13,736 --> 00:37:15,655
to Senior Uncle.

874
00:37:16,336 --> 00:37:17,655
He only treats the poor.

875
00:37:17,855 --> 00:37:19,375
He cannot seek help from the rich

876
00:37:19,655 --> 00:37:20,560
as they're not close to him.

877
00:37:20,816 --> 00:37:22,135
He cannot seek help from the poor

878
00:37:22,958 --> 00:37:23,887
as he can't bear to beg them.

879
00:37:23,935 --> 00:37:24,855
In the end,

880
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:27,296
it's all Liu Chang Qing's fault.

881
00:37:28,056 --> 00:37:28,935
When I think about it...

882
00:37:29,296 --> 00:37:30,200
Zhu Xia,

883
00:37:30,375 --> 00:37:32,415
another two students from the
apprentice class have applied for leave.

884
00:37:32,655 --> 00:37:34,895
If so, we have to rearrange

885
00:37:34,895 --> 00:37:35,776
the schedule then.

886
00:37:36,375 --> 00:37:37,270
Yeah.

887
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:39,415
A lot of them have applied
for leave lately.

888
00:37:39,776 --> 00:37:41,256
I think we need to hire a professional

889
00:37:41,375 --> 00:37:42,816
to brew herbal remedies.

890
00:37:44,816 --> 00:37:45,888
We should.

891
00:37:46,175 --> 00:37:46,976
We can't just expect our students

892
00:37:46,976 --> 00:37:48,056
to do it all.

893
00:37:48,776 --> 00:37:49,976
I'll leave this to you then.

894
00:37:50,296 --> 00:37:51,247
Don't worry.

895
00:37:51,776 --> 00:37:53,615
Meng Meng, what are you doing?

896
00:37:55,215 --> 00:37:56,114
I'm washing Tou Tou.

897
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,121
-Zhao.
-Ms Xia.

898
00:38:10,336 --> 00:38:11,415
You won't leave, right?

899
00:38:11,976 --> 00:38:12,935
Even if we're going to
recruit new people,

900
00:38:12,935 --> 00:38:14,415
we won't be able to get them
to work immediately.

901
00:38:15,135 --> 00:38:16,215
Since you're a professional,

902
00:38:16,615 --> 00:38:17,989
you mustn't leave us, okay?

903
00:38:18,816 --> 00:38:21,096
Ms Xia, the others are
only applying for leave

904
00:38:21,415 --> 00:38:22,655
as they have other
opportunities out there.

905
00:38:25,375 --> 00:38:26,455
You should stay here

906
00:38:26,455 --> 00:38:28,375
and work for us.

907
00:38:28,375 --> 00:38:29,215
It's pretty good here.

908
00:38:29,615 --> 00:38:30,575
You see,

909
00:38:30,976 --> 00:38:32,215
you can join your mentors
during consultations sessions

910
00:38:32,215 --> 00:38:33,175
after three to five years.

911
00:38:33,816 --> 00:38:34,855
After that, you can do your rounds

912
00:38:35,135 --> 00:38:36,135
as a physician
after another three to five years.

913
00:38:36,736 --> 00:38:38,016
By then,

914
00:38:38,175 --> 00:38:40,056
you would be the best

915
00:38:40,056 --> 00:38:41,056
at your field.

916
00:38:41,895 --> 00:38:42,935
You would be recognised
for your capability.

917
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:44,653
Ms Xia,

918
00:38:44,895 --> 00:38:46,056
although that's the case,

919
00:38:46,576 --> 00:38:47,505
life is

920
00:38:47,816 --> 00:38:49,576
unpredictable.

921
00:38:50,658 --> 00:38:51,567
You see,

922
00:38:51,615 --> 00:38:52,695
if the medical centre couldn't find

923
00:38:52,695 --> 00:38:54,296
another pharmacist as good as me,

924
00:38:54,496 --> 00:38:55,455
I might have to work here

925
00:38:55,455 --> 00:38:56,655
for the rest of my life.

926
00:38:57,336 --> 00:38:58,135
But you see,

927
00:38:58,135 --> 00:38:59,135
I have

928
00:38:59,135 --> 00:39:00,135
a Physician's Practice License.

929
00:39:00,576 --> 00:39:01,466
Am I right?

930
00:39:01,576 --> 00:39:02,855
You'll be worse than me then.

931
00:39:03,855 --> 00:39:04,695
I can travel the world

932
00:39:04,695 --> 00:39:05,776
and treat patients

933
00:39:06,415 --> 00:39:07,695
after five years.

934
00:39:09,855 --> 00:39:10,855
Successor, you're the best indeed.

935
00:39:11,336 --> 00:39:12,695
We have different backgrounds.
Life is different for all of us.

936
00:39:14,536 --> 00:39:15,528
It's tough for everyone.

937
00:39:23,816 --> 00:39:24,724
Tou Tou.

938
00:39:30,135 --> 00:39:31,091
Jian Xi.

939
00:39:34,655 --> 00:39:35,976
Stop looking around.
I'm the only one here.

940
00:39:42,615 --> 00:39:43,496
Let go of me.

941
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,096
Let me show you something. Come with me.

942
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,960
(Qibo Medical Centre)

943
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,785
(As Meritorious As
A Good Prime Minister)

944
00:39:59,895 --> 00:40:01,135
Liu Zi Hong!

945
00:40:01,135 --> 00:40:02,122
Help!

946
00:40:02,175 --> 00:40:03,036
Calm down!

947
00:40:04,415 --> 00:40:05,336
You!

948
00:40:05,455 --> 00:40:06,455
How could you fall out with me
just like that?

949
00:40:06,455 --> 00:40:08,056
-Stop.
-I'm here to deliver this treasure.

950
00:40:08,336 --> 00:40:09,496
Why are you biting the hand
that feeds you?

951
00:40:09,496 --> 00:40:11,016
Stop! Quiet down!

952
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:12,976
I thought you already changed your ways?

953
00:40:12,976 --> 00:40:14,336
Why are you so violent today?

954
00:40:28,855 --> 00:40:29,776
I promise

955
00:40:30,536 --> 00:40:31,855
I won't kill you today.

956
00:40:34,336 --> 00:40:35,286
Zhao Li Quan.

957
00:40:35,895 --> 00:40:36,786
It's your turn.

958
00:40:37,256 --> 00:40:38,215
Meng Meng, go ahead.

959
00:40:39,096 --> 00:40:40,169
Go now.

960
00:40:58,175 --> 00:41:00,455
Seems like there's a fungal infection
in your lungs.

961
00:41:07,016 --> 00:41:08,135
Look, it has already spread

962
00:41:08,135 --> 00:41:09,256
until here.

963
00:41:12,375 --> 00:41:13,895
Why are you only here now?

964
00:41:16,536 --> 00:41:17,976
I've been taking anti-fungal treatments

965
00:41:18,536 --> 00:41:19,736
overseas

966
00:41:20,135 --> 00:41:21,215
for over two years.

967
00:41:22,336 --> 00:41:23,256
It keeps coming back.

968
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:25,375
At first,

969
00:41:25,655 --> 00:41:27,816
they gave me Voriconazole.

970
00:41:29,256 --> 00:41:30,536
But I couldn't stand it.

971
00:41:32,895 --> 00:41:33,776
I threw up whenever
they gave me the shot.

972
00:41:35,655 --> 00:41:36,450
You threw up?

973
00:41:36,615 --> 00:41:37,419
Yes.

974
00:41:38,455 --> 00:41:40,375
After that, they changed
my prescription.

975
00:41:40,855 --> 00:41:41,731
They gave me medicine to take orally.

976
00:41:41,855 --> 00:41:43,175
I took it for over a month.

977
00:41:44,056 --> 00:41:44,855
But it wasn't

978
00:41:45,655 --> 00:41:46,496
too effective.

979
00:41:47,215 --> 00:41:48,256
I've taken so many medications

980
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:49,455
to date.

981
00:41:50,576 --> 00:41:51,415
Now, the doctors suggest me

982
00:41:51,695 --> 00:41:53,296
to go for surgery.

983
00:41:53,935 --> 00:41:55,576
I wish to give it another try.

984
00:41:55,935 --> 00:41:56,817
That's why

985
00:41:57,256 --> 00:41:58,776
I flew across the globe

986
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:00,044
to seek you out.

987
00:42:03,215 --> 00:42:04,736
How did you hear about me?

988
00:42:08,455 --> 00:42:09,655
I read

989
00:42:10,935 --> 00:42:11,895
Learning TCM, which was written by you.

990
00:42:12,175 --> 00:42:13,016
It contains cases

991
00:42:14,256 --> 00:42:16,135
similar to mine.

992
00:42:16,776 --> 00:42:17,736
They had the same condition.

993
00:42:18,415 --> 00:42:19,816
And, you treated them.

994
00:42:20,336 --> 00:42:21,615
That's why I came to seek you out.

995
00:42:22,455 --> 00:42:23,455
Madam Ba Li.

996
00:42:23,895 --> 00:42:24,786
My surname is Bai.

997
00:42:25,256 --> 00:42:26,496
My name is Jasmine.

998
00:42:27,096 --> 00:42:28,576
(Bai Mo Li)
You can call me Mo Li (Jasmine).

999
00:42:29,518 --> 00:42:30,520
Mo Li?

1000
00:42:30,576 --> 00:42:31,630
That's right.

1001
00:42:33,536 --> 00:42:34,458
Bai Mo Li, huh?

1002
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,755
Just like jasmine flowers.

1003
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,706
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

1004
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,065

traditional Chinese medicine books)
