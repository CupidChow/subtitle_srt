1
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:09,517
This is a prescription
specifically for the epidemic.

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,680
I asked my dad about it.

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:11,951
He said we could
roast brown rice until it

4
00:00:12,034 --> 00:00:13,357
turns golden brown and
make porridge with them.

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,397
It invigorates the spleen
and dispels dampness.

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,680
It's helpful against this illness.

7
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,277
I'll organise it into an article

8
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,440
and publish it on
the public account right away.

9
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,120
I'm not

10
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,480
having coronavirus, am I?

11
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,400
What you have is
more serious than coronavirus.

12
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,400
Drink your medicine.

13
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,240
Thank you, my wife.

14
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,000
Easy, easy.

15
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,480
Okay.

16
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,440
Are all the other matters
arranged properly?

17
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,040
We've accepted and treated
as many patients as possible.

18
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,040
It's all arranged,

19
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,160
so things are not as tense on our end.

20
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,640
However,

21
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,280
most patients

22
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,080
don't understand our approach.

23
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,560
After all,

24
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,760
families have to be

25
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,120
quarantined separately.

26
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,160
They would be worried about each other.

27
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,200
In special times,

28
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,120
we need special measures.

29
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,320
Isn't our family

30
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,280
doing the same?

31
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,280
Ouch, ouch.

32
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,680
Ouch, ouch

33
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,080
Don't move.

34
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,000
If this abscess doesn't heal,

35
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,277
you will suffer in your later years,
you know?

36
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,160
It's fine.

37
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,960
In my later years,

38
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,880
I have you to take care of me.

39
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,400
Where do you get the confidence
to say that?

40
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,600
I know.

41
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,680
You can't bear...

42
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,920
You can't bear to leave me behind.

43
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,600
Get some rest.

44
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,997
I need to write down
the medical record today

45
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,080
and send it to my dad.

46
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,440
Are you still mad at me?

47
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,360
Mad?

48
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,560
Why would I be mad?

49
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,160
Saying you are not mad

50
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,600
means you are mad.

51
00:02:52,713 --> 00:02:53,790
It's not worth

52
00:02:53,874 --> 00:02:54,874
punishing myself

53
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,480
for someone else's mistake.

54
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,040
If you really are not mad,

55
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,080
come.

56
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:02,960
Sit beside me.

57
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:04,840
Professor Ren,

58
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,240
please behave yourself.

59
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,320
Saying you're not angry

60
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,120
means you're angry.

61
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,120
Saying you don't hate me

62
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,320
means you truly hate me.

63
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,200
I know

64
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,480
you care about me

65
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,640
the most.

66
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,560
Otherwise,

67
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,000
you wouldn't have

68
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,120
left behind four elderly people,

69
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,840
our son,

70
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,400
and risked your own life

71
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,760
to come to me.

72
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,960
You are overthinking it.

73
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,840
I am a doctor too.

74
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,360
Both professionally and personally,
it's only right for me to be here.

75
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,240
You just

76
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,160
can't bear

77
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,480
to see me die early, can you?

78
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,640
I admire your

79
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,480
selfless dedication to TCM

80
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,400
and your selfless care for patients.

81
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,680
It has nothing to do
with personal feelings.

82
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,000
Looks like

83
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,720
you really don't love me anymore.

84
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,600
You already have a love child.

85
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,600
Do you still love me then?

86
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,720
Did you see Mr Xie?

87
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,400
Yes.

88
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,280
Did you see his wife?

89
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,920
Did she enter the mobile cabin hospital?

90
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,920
No.

91
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,920
She has been taken to ICU.

92
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,120
I don't think

93
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,400
she will come back.

94
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,760
They put her on extracorporeal
membrane oxygenation (ECMO).

95
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:13,960
His spouse,

96
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,160
I remember

97
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,520
she once said this

98
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,880
to me.

99
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,360
She said...

100
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,960
What a beautiful sunrise.

101
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,320
I wonder

102
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,640
if this glimpse

103
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,360
would be my last one.

104
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,920
Who knows...

105
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,120
Who knows

106
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,840
if this glimpse

107
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,160
would be my last one?

108
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,400
As long as we love each other,

109
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,160
we should...

110
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,440
We should treat each other kindly.

111
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,160
Zhao Li Quan,

112
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,240
guess where I am.

113
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,960
Where are you?

114
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,517
(I'm in Tong'an Hospital in Wuhan.)

115
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,840
(West 2nd General Ward.
Nurse Tian Xing Xing of Class A.)

116
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,320
You are here in Wuhan?

117
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,480
It's my duty
to treat and save patients too.

118
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,520
Don't you know how dangerous
the situation is in Wuhan right now?

119
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,520
If you can come,
why can't I, right?

120
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,400
(Besides,)

121
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,560
(I mean,)

122
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,960
I feel closer to you here.

123
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,200
(By the way,)

124
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,720
(you left in a hurry)

125
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,997
last time.

126
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,360
There was something
I didn't get a chance to tell you.

127
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,160
What is it?

128
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,240
Take care of yourself over there.

129
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,760
(We will)

130
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,440
(go back together.)

131
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,520
You too.

132
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,200
Stay protected.

133
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,840
I'll take you home.

134
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,600
(As the bright moon
shines over the sea,)

135
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,400
(from far away
you share this moment with me.)

136
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,320
(Lovers lament the distant night,)

137
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,320
(spending sleepless nights
consumed by longing.)

138
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,200
(Tian Zhen,)

139
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,360
(you taught me this poem.)

140
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,760
(You said)

141
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,640
(it's the most beautiful one
among the poems)

142
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,000
(you learned about yearning.)

143
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:14,439
(You even gave me
a challenge at the time,)

144
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,280
(mentioning a famous Japanese writer)

145
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,640
(who used the moon to express love.)

146
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,960
(I asked you many times,
but you refused to tell me)

147
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,040
(the exact line.)

148
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,840
(Now I know.)

149
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,480
(The moon tonight is truly beautiful.)

150
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,840
Have you eaten today?

151
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,240
Do you like the food?

152
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,960
The food is good,

153
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,080
but I have no appetite.

154
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,720
Let me see your tongue.

155
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,800
Do you have a bitter taste
in your mouth?

156
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:38,960
I am fine.

157
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,960
I just feel guilty.

158
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:45,960
Guilty about what?

159
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,637
Seeing all of you

160
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,197
working so hard on the front line,

161
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,280
while I'm being useless,

162
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,640
unable to do anything.

163
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,677
That's enough. Stop saying those things.

164
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,000
It makes you breathless when you speak.

165
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,317
I'll add an additional herbal medicine
for you today.

166
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,360
Looks like your vital energy
is still weak.

167
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,040
I'm consuming resources

168
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,160
without contributing anything
to the country.

169
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,800
I feel guilty.

170
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,400
Stop feeling guilty.

171
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,720
It's not beneficial to your recovery.

172
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,680
By the way,

173
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,880
Tian Zhen said

174
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,757
you haven't contacted Tou Tou
for a long time.

175
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,080
She has been asking about
Wu Shan Dao's treatment plan.

176
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,360
I didn't contact her on purpose.

177
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,317
You still haven't told her

178
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,280
you are sick?

179
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,360
No.

180
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,720
Don't you know her?

181
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,920
If she knew I was sick,

182
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,600
she would have left Shan Dao
and come to Wuhan.

183
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,360
You don't care about your son,

184
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,840
your wife,

185
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,640
your parents.

186
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,600
All you care about

187
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,800
is this girl.

188
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,240
She truly is your own daughter.

189
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,560
She is more important
than the whole family.

190
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,280
What's wrong?

191
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,280
Happy Women's Day.

192
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,120
You are so silly.

193
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,640
Looks like

194
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,160
you are getting a lot better.

195
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,800
You've never given me flowers before.

196
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,320
Where did this come from?

197
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,280
The patient I treated before

198
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,960
has recovered.

199
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,400
He is

200
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,480
now a full-time volunteer.

201
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,480
He came to visit me

202
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,600
and asked me if I needed anything.

203
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:44,920
I asked

204
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,800
if there were any roses.

205
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,920
And he brought me this single rose.

206
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,600
I will

207
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,520
put it here.

208
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,600
It gives the room a sense of vitality.

209
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,520
It's beautiful, isn't it?

210
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,000
If you think it's beautiful,

211
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,280
then don't leave.

212
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,600
Let's enjoy the flower together.

213
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,640
If you think

214
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,400
you can win me over

215
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,040
with just a rose,

216
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,757
you should reflect on

217
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,757
your mistakes.

218
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,640
Let me tell you,

219
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,560
I won't forgive you.

220
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,040
Tou Tou isn't my daughter.

221
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,920
I'm talking to you.

222
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,560
Tou Tou isn't my daughter.

223
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,000
Forget it.

224
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,640
Don't stop there.

225
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,800
Finish what you want to say.

226
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,360
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

227
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,040
Say that again.

228
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,760
Who don't you want to talk to anymore?

229
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,200
I don't want to...

230
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,840
Talk to myself anymore.

231
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,840
That's more like it.

232
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,920
Actually,

233
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,040
I've been thinking,

234
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,160
we've been married for so many years.

235
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,480
Why do you keep holding onto

236
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,720
a trivial matter like this

237
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,840
and can't let it go?

238
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,600
Where is the basic trust

239
00:16:57,895 --> 00:16:58,960
between us?

240
00:17:02,427 --> 00:17:03,827
Are you seriously blaming me?

241
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,420
If you truly trusted me,

242
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,440
would you have tested me
with something like this?

243
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,400
Come on.

244
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,160
Let's

245
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,240
make things clear today.

246
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,880
Whose daughter is Tou Tou?

247
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,760
Could she be

248
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,760
Wu Shan Dao's daughter?

249
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,200
Shan Dao didn't tell me.

250
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,240
He just told me that

251
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,037
the girl he brought back
is an offspring of

252
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,480
the Jiang family's acupuncture
technique successor.

253
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,200
But didn't Zhao Li Quan present evidence
to prove she isn't?

254
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,240
I don't know how that happened.

255
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,600
Just like you,
I really haven't got a clue.

256
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,520
Why don't you go and ask Shan Dao

257
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,920
when you go back?

258
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,120
What can I ask him?

259
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,880
He said he doesn't remember anything.

260
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,200
Well,

261
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,640
even if he doesn't remember anything,

262
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,077
with today's scientific advancements,

263
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:01,960
a simple

264
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,160
DNA test will give us the answer.

265
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,360
Tou Tou isn't your daughter.

266
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,560
Why did you say she was then?

267
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,880
For the sake of Tou Tou,

268
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,520
for the trust she just established.

269
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,120
Given her temperament,

270
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,920
we firmly believed before
that she was the successor of

271
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,120
the Jiang family's acupuncture sect.

272
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,120
If Zhao Li Quan demolished that belief,

273
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,797
then all our hard work

274
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,480
and efforts to change Tou Tou
would have gone to waste,

275
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,760
wouldn't it?

276
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,360
You're afraid of ruining your disciple,

277
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,280
but you're not afraid
of breaking my heart

278
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,760
and ruining my trust?

279
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,120
I always thought that

280
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,160
as a married couple,

281
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,360
we could read each other's mind

282
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,277
just by looking into each other's eyes.

283
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,360
I didn't expect that

284
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,800
you would crumble faster than Tou Tou.

285
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,120
After all these years of cultivation,

286
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,240
your true colours have been revealed.

287
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,400
Yet, you have the audacity

288
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,120
to sulk,

289
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,880
give me the silent treatment,

290
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,600
and take your blanket

291
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,160
and move to the massage room upstairs.

292
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,317
That's what I call failing the test.

293
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,157
You... You are the one who failed.

294
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,040
Fine.

295
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,120
I failed.

296
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,520
Who says I crumbled faster

297
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,880
than Tou Tou?

298
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,280
Actually...

299
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,200
Actually, I never doubted you at all.

300
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,920
I knew Tou Tou isn't your daughter.

301
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,800
I was just upset that

302
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,797
you put me in an embarrassing position

303
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,120
in front of so many people.

304
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,760
You didn't respect me.

305
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,720
All right, all right.

306
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,240
(Jiangzhou People's Hospital)

307
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:16,920
What's the matter?

308
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,800
Missing your master?

309
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,280
I miss them.

310
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,800
Them?

311
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,080
So, there is someone else
that you miss.

312
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:38,840
Look at you,

313
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,560
you insisted on hiding here

314
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,520
when you could have gone home.

315
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,080
Now this is great.

316
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,397
Even if you want to go back,

317
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,360
you can't.

318
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,080
I don't have a home.

319
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,000
Look at you,

320
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,520
your master treats you so well.

321
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,400
You are so ungrateful.

322
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,797
It's precisely because
my master treats me well

323
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,557
that I can't leave.

324
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,797
Can Ms Shen take care of

325
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,520
both you and Grandma alone?

326
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,240
I say,

327
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,240
has your master not contacted you
for several days?

328
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,840
They are all busy.

329
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:27,000
Looks like your master has abandoned me.

330
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,160
Nephew No. 2,

331
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:35,920
don't worry.

332
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:39,120
As long as I'm around,
your life won't be in danger.

333
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,520
I say,

334
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,360
although you performed acupuncture on me

335
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,440
under your master's guidance,

336
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,797
it is also

337
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,120
under my guidance and supervision.

338
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,157
I think

339
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,440
you should get a new master.

340
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,677
Don't be stubbornly attached
to one side.

341
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,597
Starting from tomorrow,

342
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,640
you will ask to be my disciple.

343
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,120
Don't underestimate me

344
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,320
and think I'm incapable.

345
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,760
Even though your master is renowned,

346
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,120
don't forget that I am also
a influential figure in Jiangzhou.

347
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,600
Even if I can't be number one,

348
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,437
I can at least

349
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,440
be number two.

350
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,400
I'm only telling you this,

351
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,840
if anyone else

352
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,600
wants to become my disciple,

353
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,000
I won't even bother.

354
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,760
I see how dedicated you have been

355
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,000
taking care of me these days.

356
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,280
That's why I'm willing
to let go of the grudge,

357
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,360
and I don't mean you,

358
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,240
I mean the grudge against your master,

359
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,560
and accept you as my student.

360
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,680
Don't hesitate anymore.

361
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,760
That's quite a tempting offer.

362
00:22:59,000 --> 00:22:59,917
I've made up my mind.

363
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,240
Made up your mind about what?

364
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,400
Once I'm out of the hospital,

365
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,800
I will kowtow to Senior Master.

366
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,797
If he could teach
the two of you so well,

367
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,800
then teaching me should not
be a problem, right?

368
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,917
It's settled, I will kowtow
to Senior Master.

369
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Child,

370
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,400
I don't admire anyone else,
but I truly admire you.

371
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,480
Even when you turn someone down,

372
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,080
you manage to do it tactfully
without hurting our relationship.

373
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,280
Hello, everyone. I'm Dr Peng.

374
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,280
I will teach everyone how to make

375
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,517
Fried Rice Tea and Egg Dumplings
in today's live stream.

376
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,400
Let's start with

377
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,640
the Egg Dumplings.

378
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,277
(Class representative, Xiao Hong,
are you ready?)

379
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,640
All ready to go.

380
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,200
First, let's put oil

381
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,440
in the pan

382
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,120
and evenly preheat it.

383
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,120
Then, we'll add
the previously beaten eggs.

384
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,000
As for the dumplings,

385
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,760
I've chosen Shrimp Supreme Dumpling.

386
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,677
These dumplings have

387
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,080
whole and large shrimp inside.

388
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,397
Shrimp meat contains abundant protein

389
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,360
and essential trace elements
needed by the human body.

390
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,240
So, we should eat more shrimp meat.

391
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,120
The heat of the oil is about right.
Now we can add the dumplings.

392
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,080
Cook them on low heat for three minutes.

393
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,040
Remember, it must be low heat.

394
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:25,840
Careful!

395
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,397
This is very normal.

396
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,840
You know that, right?

397
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:31,296
The eggs fried this way

398
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,920
taste especially good, you know?

399
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,877
Class representative, Xiao Hong,
was just a little impatient.

400
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,880
We were supposed to add the eggs later.

401
00:24:41,253 --> 00:24:43,636
(Don't criticise her anymore.
Or she won't be frying the pan anymore,)

402
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,792
(she will be toasting you.)

403
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,800
Oh, my God.

404
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:54,960
Where is it?

405
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,280
On the right. Bingfeng acupoint.

406
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,560
Tianzong acupoint.

407
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,800
And around Xinshu acupoint.

408
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,080
Is that really important whether
or not Tou Tou is my daughter?

409
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,400
One day as a teacher,

410
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,600
a lifetime as a father.

411
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,960
Isn't that how it is
in our ancient Chinese culture?

412
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,320
The master

413
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,720
is like a father.

414
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,320
It's different.

415
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,240
You really can't accept Tou Tou

416
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,520
as a member of our family?

417
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,317
I can't accept that

418
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,920
you have someone else in your heart.

419
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,640
Why have I been together

420
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,600
with you for so many years?

421
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,800
You always donate money

422
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,840
and visit other cities to
provide medical support.

423
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,637
I never complained

424
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,800
and fully supported you.

425
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,640
But you haven't treated me well.

426
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,480
Other couples enjoy romance and love,

427
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,037
but with you,

428
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,197
it's always about hardships

429
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,440
and sacrifices.

430
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,080
I've been the one holding
this family together.

431
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:06,840
In the end,

432
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,640
I can't even get your loyalty,
which is the most basic thing.

433
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,040
What should I do?

434
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,440
You've destroyed my trust.

435
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,880
Now that I've told you the truth.

436
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,800
Have I earned your trust again?

437
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,280
No.

438
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,677
There's something that
has been weighing on my mind,

439
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,040
and I want to ask you directly.

440
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,760
Today, you must give me
an honest answer.

441
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,000
What's the deal

442
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,520
between you and Little Lark?

443
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,480
What's your relationship?

444
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,280
I only said that I was Tou Tou's father.

445
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,600
Now you're even trying
to find her mother for me?

446
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,200
(The fact that you've been
searching for her all these years)

447
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,600
(shows that)

448
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,600
(you can't forget about her, right?)

449
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:09,840
(If she hadn't)

450
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,720
(dropped out of school back then,)

451
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,720
(maybe we wouldn't have
started our relationship.)

452
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,000
So, your trust

453
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,960
was built on doubt all along?

454
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,400
Have you always had her in your heart?

455
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,440
Have you?

456
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,560
Yes.

457
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,160
Listen,

458
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,120
it's not what you imagine.

459
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,640
Do you know why Little Lark
dropped out of school?

460
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,360
It's because of me.

461
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,400
I made a mistake

462
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,120
that caused her to lose
her hearing in both ears.

463
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,800
You don't know this,

464
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,040
but the hardships I faced on my journey

465
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,240
to learn TCM knowledge

466
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,637
were unimaginable

467
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,317
for descendants of TCM families

468
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,560
like you.

469
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,437
In order to learn the essence of TCM,

470
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,000
I had studied under many masters.

471
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,040
(Now it seems that)

472
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,240
(some of those masters)

473
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,520
(had limitation in their knowledge.)

474
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,520
(At that time,)

475
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,280
(I didn't have the ability
to discern their shortcomings.)

476
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,360
I will insert the needle now.

477
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:44,840
(I didn't know)

478
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,000
the gravity of it.

479
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,440
I was bold

480
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,040
but lacked

481
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,240
a very good teacher

482
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,677
to guide me.

483
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,520
I was just experimenting
on my treatments.

484
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,560
You can't imagine

485
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,400
how innocent and naive

486
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,360
those people were

487
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,920
(in those days.)

488
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,920
(She believed in me)

489
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,440
(and let me treat her.)

490
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,160
And the result...

491
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,120
What happened?

492
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,440
The result was...

493
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,200
She became deaf in both ears.

494
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,520
At that time,
I thought it was temporary.

495
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,720
We sought treatment

496
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,560
from both TCM and Western doctors.

497
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,400
Six months passed,

498
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,600
and it was too late to change anything.

499
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,680
Stop blaming yourself.

500
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,680
Little Lark left without telling anyone

501
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,640
because she didn't want
to see you like this.

502
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,960
She even packed her stuff by herself.

503
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:22,920
Study well.

504
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,920
The only thing you can do

505
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,360
to atone for it
is to become a great doctor.

506
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:43,037
My heart always aches
when I think about her,

507
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,000
you know?

508
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:45,920
If there's anyone

509
00:30:48,913 --> 00:30:50,913
I've failed in my life,

510
00:30:52,273 --> 00:30:53,553
it's Little Lark.

511
00:30:58,246 --> 00:30:59,327
It was a mistake,

512
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,677
but in a way, it was also a good thing.

513
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,960
Because of her,

514
00:31:04,832 --> 00:31:07,072
I have truly devoted myself to studying.

515
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:11,277
I want to learn pure TCM

516
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,040
and become the best doctor.

517
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,120
No matter where she is,

518
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,880
I will find her.

519
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,640
With my current understanding of TCM,

520
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,280
I want to take a chance.

521
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:30,960
I know

522
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,480
you have always approached TCM

523
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,437
with caution

524
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,760
and meticulousness,

525
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,360
and treated patients

526
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,480
with utmost care.

527
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:45,760
I didn't realise

528
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,400
that it was Little Lark
who made you who you are today.

529
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,760
Then, did you see her
at the class reunion?

530
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:55,920
Yes, I did.

531
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,040
She is still as cheerful as ever.

532
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,960
She didn't utter a word
of resentment towards me.

533
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,240
Didn't you treat her?

534
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,480
I couldn't convince her.

535
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,320
She said she had given up on treatment.

536
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,360
She has adapted to the quiet world.

537
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,160
I feel so regretful.

538
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,640
Xin Zheng...

539
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:35,920
When we...

540
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,800
When we leave Wuhan,

541
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,920
bring me to her.

542
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,880
I will convince her.

543
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,760
I will treat her, okay?

544
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:48,920
Okay.

545
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,080
Let's seal it.

546
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,480
You are my dearest wife.

547
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,640
But I'm still mad at you.

548
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,960
I mean,

549
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,960
something this huge

550
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,320
has been weighed

551
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,360
on your heart for decades.

552
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,920
Yet you didn't even tell your wife.

553
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,400
You just didn't...

554
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,320
You just didn't trust me.

555
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,880
Telling you

556
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,197
would only make one more person

557
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:30,000
carry the guilt in this world.

558
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,760
Guilt doesn't solve anything.

559
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,680
The only thing I could do
is to keep learning

560
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,640
and improving myself.

561
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,640
I may have a chance
to change the result.

562
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,280
But

563
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,240
this big rock must be so heavy
in your heart.

564
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,160
How many things have you kept inside?

565
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,760
Now you understand

566
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,277
why I've been so strict

567
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,640
with Tian Zhen.

568
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,080
While others praise him,

569
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,760
I scold him.

570
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:17,040
I just don't want him to be like me,

571
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,960
to be easily swayed

572
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,397
by a little bit

573
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,640
of praise and opportunities,

574
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,080
forgetting

575
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,560
the value of life.

576
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,160
I don't want him to make

577
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,720
the same lifelong regrets that I did.

578
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,560
He won't.

579
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,960
Our son won't.

580
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,120
He really

581
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,760
looks like a doctor now.

582
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,720
Yes.

583
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,800
Through this epidemic, I've seen it.

584
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,600
This kid

585
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,800
is cut out to be a TCM practitioner.

586
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,957
His pure heart

587
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,320
matches his name,

588
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,200
Tian Zhen.

589
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,040
I know, right?

590
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,680
Let me ask you.

591
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,320
Have you ever

592
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,560
had feelings

593
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,720
for Little Lark?

594
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,320
You know, like a secret crush.

595
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,840
Even Dad said

596
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:35,840
that you and her

597
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,800
were evenly matched in your class.

598
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,720
Wu Shan Dao was even a bit behind her.

599
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,400
That's narrow-minded.

600
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,280
Do you think there's only romantic
love between a man and a woman?

601
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,280
There's also another kind of connection,

602
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,320
a mutual appreciation.

603
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,160
Come on,

604
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,997
just admit that you had a crush on her.

605
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,880
What mutual appreciation?

606
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,320
I've been thinking,

607
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,040
if I didn't

608
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,760
have feelings

609
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,000
for someone else back then,

610
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,080
given my mistakes,

611
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,200
I should have...

612
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,280
I should have married her.

613
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,560
She wouldn't have ended up

614
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:19,960
alone until now.

615
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,280
Ren Xin Zheng,

616
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,840
come clean now.

617
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,640
How many women are there in your heart?

618
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,600
Who else did you have feelings for?

619
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,640
I don't dare to say anymore.

620
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:38,840
Tell me!

621
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,520
Tell me!

622
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,400
Stop trying to scare me by coughing.

623
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,640
Have some water.

624
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,437
Do you remember

625
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,960
where we first met?

626
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,280
Of course I remember.

627
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,037
You always forget,

628
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,120
saying that it was
during our university days.

629
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,240
Actually, I noticed you
long before that.

630
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,360
It was when you were
in your second year of university.

631
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,360
You came to our house to talk to my dad
about your thesis.

632
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,640
We were on the rooftop of the old house.

633
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,600
I was in high school at that time.

634
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:37,600
The first time we met was at the school.

635
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,480
Not when you started school,

636
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,080
but when I started university.

637
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,120
I think

638
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,320
at that time,

639
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,800
you must have been in
your first senior year of high school.

640
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,480
You were wearing a blue dress.

641
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,237
Lan Lan!

642
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,040
-Make way!
-Slow down!

643
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,317
Unbelievable!

644
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,840
Slow down! Be careful!

645
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,680
Careful not to hit someone!

646
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:21,840
You...

647
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,477
Move! Move!

648
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,520
Don't ride so fast!

649
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,840
Move! Move!

650
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,200
Watch out!

651
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,800
Why haven't I seen you wearing
the blue dress again after that?

652
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:53,960
Oh, right.

653
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,120
Where did that blue dress go?

654
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,080
How come I couldn't find it later?

655
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,040
Why did you only tell me this now?

656
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,880
Were you planning
to keep it a secret from me forever?

657
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,280
We need to save our trump cards

658
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,640
for critical moments.

659
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,400
You're just too cunning.

660
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,840
What's wrong with being cunning?

661
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,280
Unlike you,

662
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,520
whose mind is so easy to read.

663
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,637
Now you understand

664
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,040
why your father passed on
the position to me

665
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,040
instead of you, right?

666
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,560
You women

667
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,400
always ask men if they love you or not.

668
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,280
Do you love me?

669
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,157
Tell me! Tell me!

670
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,560
Tell me! Tell me!

671
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,600
Actually, I'm confessing my love to you

672
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,000
with my whole life.

673
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,760
Do you understand now?

674
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,080
You don't feel jealous now, do you?

675
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,000
Am I the jealous one?

676
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:00,760
I am.

677
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,080
Now, I have to tell you
about another thing

678
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,880
that you might not be happy about.

679
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,720
There aren't so
many unhappy things in life.

680
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,040
It's all happy things. Happy things.

681
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,757
Life has a way
of slapping you in the face,

682
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,440
reminding you

683
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,480
of the emotional vulnerabilities
you have.

684
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,560
Let it slap, let it be.

685
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:27,997
With you by my side,

686
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,560
I have a suit of armour.

687
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,560
Life's default setting

688
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,240
is ups and downs,

689
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,840
twists and turns.

690
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,157
When you embrace something joyful,

691
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,640
there's always something sad
waiting for you.

692
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,880
There aren't that many sad things.

693
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,677
When you have the love of your life,

694
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,840
it's all joy.

695
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,640
You no longer doubt

696
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,640
that Tou Tou is my daughter,

697
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,080
but she may become
our daughter-in-law.

698
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,480
(The prescriptions and remedies

699
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,037

traditional Chinese medicine books)
