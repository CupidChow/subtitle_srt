1
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,896
(Gen Z)

2
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,080
(Episode 38)

3
00:01:38,336 --> 00:01:40,880
(Jiangzhou People's Hospital)

4
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:43,551
You have to stop being
dependent on people.

5
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,671
I'll teach you, and you can
give me the acupuncture treatment.

6
00:01:48,671 --> 00:01:49,511
That's not a good idea.

7
00:01:52,671 --> 00:01:53,536
Child,

8
00:01:54,271 --> 00:01:55,390
my legs may be disabled,

9
00:01:55,431 --> 00:01:56,671
but my brain is not.

10
00:01:57,671 --> 00:01:58,950
You should know that your master and I

11
00:01:58,991 --> 00:02:00,351
were in the same sect.

12
00:02:01,991 --> 00:02:02,880
Alright then.

13
00:02:04,351 --> 00:02:05,271
Let me ask you something.

14
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:07,671
How did you fall?

15
00:02:11,391 --> 00:02:12,630
I don't remember that.

16
00:02:12,671 --> 00:02:13,991
You see? When I ask you,

17
00:02:13,991 --> 00:02:15,071
you say you don't remember.

18
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,160
How should I know
if you can do acupuncture or not?

19
00:02:18,031 --> 00:02:19,351
Why don't I recite the
Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic

20
00:02:19,351 --> 00:02:20,224
for you?

21
00:02:21,191 --> 00:02:22,044
If not,

22
00:02:22,511 --> 00:02:23,711
why don't you test me
with the acupoints?

23
00:02:23,711 --> 00:02:24,497
Enough.

24
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,511
Just rest well.

25
00:02:26,071 --> 00:02:27,551
If Master doesn't reply to me

26
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,310
by 8pm,

27
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,391
I'll give you the same
acupuncture treatment as yesterday.

28
00:02:31,591 --> 00:02:32,430
Be careful.

29
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,910
You're a loyal student

30
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,430
of his indeed.

31
00:02:38,711 --> 00:02:39,529
Is it hot?

32
00:02:39,751 --> 00:02:40,607
No.

33
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:42,474
Who's my mother?

34
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:46,510
Little Lark?

35
00:02:49,151 --> 00:02:50,029
Who?

36
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:53,646
Fine.

37
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:57,870
When I ask you about something,

38
00:02:58,151 --> 00:02:59,075
you don't remember.

39
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:00,351
And, I can't follow your bidding

40
00:03:00,351 --> 00:03:01,151
without being worried.

41
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,446
We'll never

42
00:03:02,471 --> 00:03:03,910
be on the same page.

43
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:08,431
We should stick to
your master's instructions.

44
00:03:14,791 --> 00:03:16,751
If only he was the one
with amnesia instead.

45
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:19,439
I guess

46
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,351
you can make the call here.

47
00:03:23,607 --> 00:03:24,431
Wait.

48
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:26,151
I can't even tell

49
00:03:26,151 --> 00:03:27,360
if you're pretending to be dumb here.

50
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,138
Enough.

51
00:03:30,391 --> 00:03:31,791
You have no idea what I'm saying

52
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:32,646
at all.

53
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,991
I don't know whether to act dumb or not

54
00:03:36,031 --> 00:03:37,671
all because of

55
00:03:37,671 --> 00:03:38,671
that master of yours.

56
00:03:39,751 --> 00:03:40,615
Hurry up.

57
00:03:40,751 --> 00:03:41,671
Help me make a call.

58
00:03:41,671 --> 00:03:42,471
Ask Shen Xin

59
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:44,151
how my mother is doing.

60
00:03:45,431 --> 00:03:46,270
What's with the shush?

61
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,550
Hurry and call her.

62
00:03:47,991 --> 00:03:48,904
Don't waste any time.

63
00:03:54,071 --> 00:03:54,950
Tian Zhen,

64
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:56,190
have you read the news?

65
00:03:56,871 --> 00:03:58,231
(How's the situation over your side?)

66
00:03:59,231 --> 00:04:00,270
(Are Mr Niu and his son)

67
00:04:00,311 --> 00:04:01,591
(confirmed cases?)

68
00:04:01,591 --> 00:04:02,591
Did you guys quarantine them?

69
00:04:03,711 --> 00:04:05,231
I'm doing fine here. Mum, don't worry.

70
00:04:06,071 --> 00:04:07,270
But we didn't manage to save

71
00:04:07,311 --> 00:04:08,232
Mr Niu's son.

72
00:04:08,511 --> 00:04:09,431
(Mr Niu is doing fine.)

73
00:04:09,591 --> 00:04:10,991
(He's staying in
the provincial hospital for now.)

74
00:04:11,431 --> 00:04:12,711
(How are you and my grandparents doing?)

75
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:15,351
We're doing fine. Don't worry about us.

76
00:04:15,351 --> 00:04:17,351
(Is the situation in the town
under control?)

77
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:18,458
Yeah.

78
00:04:18,991 --> 00:04:19,871
Dad is here.

79
00:04:20,311 --> 00:04:21,630
He guided me after he came here.

80
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,110
The prescription he gave me
was right on point.

81
00:04:23,351 --> 00:04:24,511
(I've already notified everyone)

82
00:04:24,511 --> 00:04:25,404
(according to Dad's instructions.)

83
00:04:25,871 --> 00:04:27,760
I told them not to come to us
if they're sick.

84
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,520
I'll go to them instead.

85
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,511
Do you have enough face masks?
Do you need me to send more to you?

86
00:04:30,711 --> 00:04:31,991
(Yeah, I brought a lot of them with me.)

87
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:33,161
Tian Zhen,

88
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,390
have you guys run out of medicine?

89
00:04:35,871 --> 00:04:37,320
(Chinese New Year is nearing.)

90
00:04:37,431 --> 00:04:38,791
(I wonder if the courier company)

91
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:39,711
(will cease operation by then.)

92
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:40,951
(We'll send some to you.)

93
00:04:41,071 --> 00:04:41,871
(And,)

94
00:04:41,871 --> 00:04:43,431
the flu sachet

95
00:04:43,431 --> 00:04:44,311
is pretty effective.

96
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:45,311
Do you keep it on?

97
00:04:45,511 --> 00:04:46,419
Yeah, I do.

98
00:04:46,871 --> 00:04:47,791
I've been keeping it on. Look.

99
00:04:48,431 --> 00:04:49,982
-(It's over here.)
-Tian Zhen,

100
00:04:50,351 --> 00:04:51,270
listen.

101
00:04:51,511 --> 00:04:52,711
Judging from the circumstances,

102
00:04:52,711 --> 00:04:54,791
it's not realistic for you to come back.

103
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:56,190
You must take good care of yourself.

104
00:04:56,991 --> 00:04:58,511
Luckily, your father is there with you.

105
00:04:58,750 --> 00:04:59,991
(We can rest at ease now.)

106
00:05:00,431 --> 00:05:01,550
Take care of yourself.

107
00:05:03,991 --> 00:05:04,935
Tian Zhen,

108
00:05:05,711 --> 00:05:07,431
tell your father to talk to me.

109
00:05:09,711 --> 00:05:10,711
Dad doesn't allow me to.

110
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:12,110
Now, we need to maintain
social distancing.

111
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:14,591
Where is he?

112
00:05:16,431 --> 00:05:18,231
(He's living in the opposite room.)

113
00:05:18,311 --> 00:05:19,511
(Our rooms aren't next to each other.)

114
00:05:20,071 --> 00:05:20,991
Take a photo

115
00:05:20,991 --> 00:05:21,927
and show it to me.

116
00:05:22,511 --> 00:05:23,871
Mum, if you're looking for him,

117
00:05:23,871 --> 00:05:25,311
you can call him directly.

118
00:05:25,351 --> 00:05:26,351
(You don't need to go through
all this trouble.)

119
00:05:27,231 --> 00:05:28,107
Ren Tian Zhen.

120
00:05:29,431 --> 00:05:30,310
Where's your father?

121
00:05:33,431 --> 00:05:34,951
(Don't lie to me. Tell me the truth.)

122
00:05:38,151 --> 00:05:39,231
(Dad went to Wuhan.)

123
00:05:40,231 --> 00:05:41,122
What?

124
00:05:41,351 --> 00:05:42,351
That's a huge deal!

125
00:05:42,351 --> 00:05:43,431
Why didn't he notify us

126
00:05:43,431 --> 00:05:44,390
beforehand?

127
00:05:51,591 --> 00:05:52,911
You two, stop calling him.

128
00:06:01,191 --> 00:06:02,005
Hello?

129
00:06:03,151 --> 00:06:04,191
Have you reached Wuhan?

130
00:06:05,471 --> 00:06:06,310
(Yeah.)

131
00:06:06,431 --> 00:06:07,365
I've reached Wuhan.

132
00:06:08,031 --> 00:06:09,751
Many of our peers are infected.

133
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,751
(We're lacking in medical supplies.)

134
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,151
(What about this?)

135
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,790
Get some face masks

136
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,270
and sanitisers for me.

137
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,591
(Let's close
the medical centre for now.)

138
00:06:17,991 --> 00:06:18,871
(Get more face masks)

139
00:06:18,871 --> 00:06:19,991
(and send them here.)

140
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,390
They're barely taking

141
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,790
any protective measures here.

142
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,154
Okay, I understand.

143
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,070
I'll do an inventory count now.

144
00:06:27,871 --> 00:06:28,763
What about this?

145
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:30,070
You can keep one or two boxes

146
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,390
for Master and Madam.

147
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:32,751
You don't need to care about us.

148
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,110
Just take good care of yourself.

149
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:35,991
Yeah, forget about us.

150
00:06:35,991 --> 00:06:37,110
You're on the frontline.

151
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,311
Safety first, you hear me?

152
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,830
I heard Master's voice.

153
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,263
Ling Lan,

154
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,230
I'll leave Master and Madam to you.

155
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:47,790
I'll leave our family

156
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:50,716
to you.

157
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:54,390
Don't worry.

158
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:56,790
Take good care of yourself.

159
00:06:59,712 --> 00:07:00,661
Don't worry.

160
00:07:02,871 --> 00:07:04,311
A patient is coming. I'll hang up now.

161
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,670
Okay. Goodbye.

162
00:07:05,913 --> 00:07:06,763
Hurry!

163
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:07,991
Someone!

164
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:20,740
Dad, Mum,

165
00:07:21,591 --> 00:07:23,431
I've decided to bring
Xin Zheng's parents

166
00:07:23,431 --> 00:07:24,390
here.

167
00:07:24,991 --> 00:07:25,950
I'll bring Tou Tou here too.

168
00:07:28,234 --> 00:07:29,146
Ling Lan,

169
00:07:30,311 --> 00:07:31,790
I support your decision.

170
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,270
I will arrange Tou Tou

171
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,631
to pick up Grandpa and Granny in Yunnan.

172
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:38,950
After that,

173
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,110
I'll head to the medical centre

174
00:07:40,591 --> 00:07:41,450
and prepare to close it down.

175
00:07:43,151 --> 00:07:44,031
I'll check on

176
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,431
Shan Dao too.

177
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:46,911
Is Tian Zhen coming back?

178
00:07:49,991 --> 00:07:50,871
He's my son.

179
00:07:51,505 --> 00:07:52,380
I'll make the call.

180
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,270
This is a crucial moment to see if

181
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,110
he can establish a foothold in medicine.

182
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,160
And, if he stays at Hubei,

183
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,431
he can assist Xin Zheng

184
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,230
when it's necessary.

185
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,575
-I'll make the preparations then.
-Okay.

186
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,247
Hello?

187
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:13,474
Tou Tou,

188
00:08:13,591 --> 00:08:14,390
where are you?

189
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:16,830
This is my daughter indeed.

190
00:08:17,431 --> 00:08:18,751
She never panics during
such important moments.

191
00:08:19,593 --> 00:08:20,715
She's my daughter too.

192
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,255
She did

193
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:24,991
take after me.

194
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,040
(Major Cold represents)

195
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,278
(the extremely cold weather.)

196
00:08:34,418 --> 00:08:36,920
(Once Major Cold is over,)

197
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,160
(winter will pass, and spring will come)

198
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:43,655
(Thus, a new cycle begins.)

199
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,111
(Major Cold)

200
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,021
Ren,

201
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,130
I'm afraid

202
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,871
we can't treat this disease in time

203
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,550
if we have to wait for Western medicine.

204
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:05,950
We need to depend on

205
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,070
TCM for this.

206
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:08,110
Let's use both acupuncture
and Chinese medicine.

207
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:09,670
It'll definitely work.

208
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:12,830
Mr Luo, were you looking for me?

209
00:09:13,047 --> 00:09:14,435
Mr Wang, let me introduce him to you.

210
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:15,670
This is

211
00:09:15,711 --> 00:09:16,830
Professor Ren Xin Zheng from

212
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:17,711
Jiangzhou University
of Chinese Medicine.

213
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:18,991
This is the head of the
Internal Medicine Department,

214
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:19,865
Wang You Ming.

215
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:21,110
Nice to meet you, Mr Wang.

216
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:23,270
So, you're the famous Professor Ren.

217
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,110
You flatter me.

218
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,510
I read your books before.

219
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:26,991
And, Luo kept telling me

220
00:09:26,991 --> 00:09:28,950
about your legendary tales.

221
00:09:30,025 --> 00:09:30,896
Thank you

222
00:09:30,991 --> 00:09:32,591
for coming all the way here

223
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:33,711
when we're having a tough time.

224
00:09:34,434 --> 00:09:35,409
You flatter me.

225
00:09:35,591 --> 00:09:36,830
How's the situation here?

226
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:38,950
It's bad.

227
00:09:39,991 --> 00:09:41,270
We used Azithromycin,

228
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,177
Moxifloxacin Hydrochloride tablets,

229
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:43,790
expectorant,

230
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:46,070
and even Chinese medicine.

231
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,311
Now, it seems like

232
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,110
Diammonium Glycyrrhizinate

233
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:50,390
is a little effective.

234
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,311
However, we're not sure.

235
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,640
By the way, when I was doing my rounds,

236
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,599
a patient told me that he felt
much more comfortable

237
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,110
after receiving acupuncture treatment.

238
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:58,790
It felt as if a heavy rock

239
00:09:58,830 --> 00:09:59,790
has been lifted from his chest.

240
00:10:01,015 --> 00:10:02,895
I was beside Professor Ren just now.

241
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,390
Right after he delivered
the acupuncture treatment,

242
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,471
the patient said

243
00:10:05,711 --> 00:10:06,871
he felt much better.

244
00:10:06,871 --> 00:10:07,670
Yeah.

245
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:09,550
I don't understand

246
00:10:09,831 --> 00:10:11,150
TCM at all.

247
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,191
We Western doctors

248
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:14,391
haven't even figured out the virus.

249
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:15,511
However,

250
00:10:15,751 --> 00:10:17,271
you already started to treat them.

251
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:18,431
The thing is,

252
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:19,470
the patient said it was effective

253
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,951
after receiving
the acupuncture treatment.

254
00:10:21,511 --> 00:10:22,511
Is this a case of

255
00:10:22,751 --> 00:10:23,910
placebo treatment?

256
00:10:23,951 --> 00:10:25,191
In my opinion,

257
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:27,071
Western medicine studies

258
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:28,511
the sicknesses that humans have

259
00:10:29,511 --> 00:10:31,071
while Chinese medicine studies

260
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,910
humans who are sick.

261
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:36,710
Virus is just like a seed.

262
00:10:37,071 --> 00:10:38,350
If a seed wants to sprout,

263
00:10:38,511 --> 00:10:41,710
it needs a suitable environment,
soil and temperature.

264
00:10:42,271 --> 00:10:44,350
I don't care what kind of seed it is.

265
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:45,631
If I ruin

266
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,470
its growing environment,

267
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,631
the virus will vanish.

268
00:10:49,391 --> 00:10:50,271
So, you're saying

269
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,511
that the growing environment for viruses

270
00:10:53,071 --> 00:10:54,150
is the human body, right?

271
00:10:54,631 --> 00:10:56,710
That's completely right.

272
00:10:56,951 --> 00:10:58,191
If the body is cold, make it warm.

273
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:00,071
If the body is hot, cool it down.

274
00:11:00,071 --> 00:11:01,191
There's no need to
inquire about the sickness.

275
00:11:01,271 --> 00:11:02,910
Balance in all things.

276
00:11:03,951 --> 00:11:05,511
When a patient is sick,

277
00:11:05,511 --> 00:11:07,910
they don't feel it.

278
00:11:07,951 --> 00:11:10,710
As long as they pull through
the most dangerous moments

279
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,751
and let their immunity grow,

280
00:11:13,271 --> 00:11:14,470
their bodies

281
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:15,751
will recover naturally.

282
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,271
That's right.

283
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:20,511
-I have a favour to ask of you.
-Please speak up.

284
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:21,677
Our hospital

285
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,150
is already at maximum capacity.

286
00:11:23,951 --> 00:11:26,470
And, the community is still sending
more and more patients here.

287
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:27,372
Look.

288
00:11:27,631 --> 00:11:28,991
-Our Inpatient Department
-Yeah.

289
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,150
is barely 300m²,

290
00:11:30,271 --> 00:11:31,311
but we have so many patients here.

291
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:32,350
Even if they aren't sick,

292
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:33,590
they'll be infected eventually.

293
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:36,391
A patient told me

294
00:11:36,631 --> 00:11:38,431
that you were quick in administering
your acupuncture treatment.

295
00:11:39,191 --> 00:11:40,122
I was thinking

296
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,365
that if you could

297
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,639
help out our community as well

298
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,710
so that our pressure
could be alleviated.

299
00:11:46,071 --> 00:11:48,030
Of course, they lack
basic supplies there.

300
00:11:48,391 --> 00:11:49,271
It'll be even tougher than here.

301
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:50,670
Please consider it.

302
00:11:51,271 --> 00:11:52,191
If you agree to it,

303
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,150
I'll introduce you to them.

304
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:55,490
No problem.

305
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,496
No problem.

306
00:11:56,831 --> 00:11:57,708
This is great.

307
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,846
This is great.

308
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:00,631
Professor Ren, thank you so much.

309
00:12:00,631 --> 00:12:01,751
-Don't mention it.
-Thank you.

310
00:12:01,751 --> 00:12:02,590
-It's what I should do.
-Thank you.

311
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:03,951
You're doing us a huge favour.

312
00:12:03,951 --> 00:12:04,872
It's my job.

313
00:12:04,971 --> 00:12:07,039
(Qibo Medical Centre)

314
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:09,431
Today's the last day
for the city express service.

315
00:12:09,831 --> 00:12:11,391
We have to go on a break

316
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,431
after packing these goods.

317
00:12:17,071 --> 00:12:18,910
-(Li Quan.)
-Hello, Mr Ren?

318
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,230
(How are things over there?)

319
00:12:20,751 --> 00:12:21,590
I'm doing fine.

320
00:12:23,271 --> 00:12:24,910
Have you found the reason
you came in the first place?

321
00:12:26,191 --> 00:12:27,631
Mr Ren, what do you mean by that?

322
00:12:28,511 --> 00:12:29,670
If there's a tough battle ahead,

323
00:12:29,831 --> 00:12:31,350
will you be willing to join us?

324
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,191
Of course.

325
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,631
I lack manpower here.

326
00:12:42,951 --> 00:12:44,631
If this is something like SARS,

327
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:45,991
it'll be a matter of life and death.

328
00:12:47,191 --> 00:12:48,146
Mr Ren,

329
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:49,951
I already died once.

330
00:12:50,391 --> 00:12:51,550
(You were the one who rescued me.)

331
00:12:52,191 --> 00:12:53,230
(I'm not afraid of death itself,)

332
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:54,470
(let alone this disease.)

333
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:56,740
Good.

334
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,271
(My wife has already prepared)

335
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,280
(the necessary materials
to fight against)

336
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:02,391
the epidemic.

337
00:13:02,391 --> 00:13:03,450
You...

338
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:06,271
You can drive Yang Xiao Hong's car here.

339
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,083
Okay.

340
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,779
Thank you.

341
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,612
Mr Ren,

342
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:13,191
I should be thanking you instead.

343
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:22,030
-Was it Professor Ren?
-Yes.

344
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,030
Mr Ren told me to head to Wuhan.

345
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,071
You can take my car then.

346
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:27,470
It can fit more medical supplies.

347
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:28,357
Yeah.

348
00:13:29,071 --> 00:13:29,904
Okay.

349
00:13:45,289 --> 00:13:46,130
What are you doing here?

350
00:13:47,751 --> 00:13:49,110
I'm heading to Wuhan soon.

351
00:13:49,472 --> 00:13:50,302
I'm here to visit you.

352
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:52,511
Wuhan?

353
00:13:53,391 --> 00:13:55,150
Have you lost your mind?
Didn't you read the news?

354
00:13:55,511 --> 00:13:56,511
Even experts said that we should
avoid going there.

355
00:13:56,511 --> 00:13:57,831
Why must you go there?

356
00:13:58,391 --> 00:13:59,831
Mr Ren needs all the help he can get.

357
00:14:00,511 --> 00:14:01,350
Why must it be you

358
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:02,391
when there are other people
in the medical centre?

359
00:14:03,951 --> 00:14:04,841
I have to go.

360
00:14:06,271 --> 00:14:07,511
And, I don't know

361
00:14:07,511 --> 00:14:08,631
when I'll be back.

362
00:14:09,951 --> 00:14:10,910
I'm here to bid farewell to you.

363
00:14:20,391 --> 00:14:22,071
We brewed this
herbal medicine soup ourselves.

364
00:14:23,106 --> 00:14:23,934
Remember to take it.

365
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:30,512
Oh yeah.

366
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:34,458
I made

367
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:36,350
a scented sachet for you.

368
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,170
See you.

369
00:15:07,511 --> 00:15:09,150
(January 23rd, 10am,)

370
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,831
(passages out of Wuhan
were blocked off.)

371
00:15:10,831 --> 00:15:12,751
(Staying united,
combating the epidemic.)

372
00:15:13,191 --> 00:15:15,150
(Wuhan is the city of heroes.)

373
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,350
(They will pull through.)

374
00:15:18,431 --> 00:15:19,910
(During Chinese New Year's Eve,)

375
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:22,631
(planes are heading
toward Wuhan instead.)

376
00:15:24,271 --> 00:15:25,751
(The most outstanding doctors)

377
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:27,110
(the most advanced equipment,)

378
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:28,710
(and the urgent supplies
they need have been gathered.)

379
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:29,525
(The cure rate,)

380
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:31,350
(lowering the infection rate
to the minimum,)

381
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:32,150
(fatality rate...)

382
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,432
(Everyone takes a part in fighting
the epidemic, no visitors allowed)

383
00:15:50,751 --> 00:15:52,191
Those who are well-versed
in administering acupuncture treatment

384
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,751
treat the right with the left

385
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:55,350
and treat the left with the right.

386
00:15:56,071 --> 00:15:57,271
Once you find the position,

387
00:15:57,271 --> 00:15:58,470
you just need to confirm
the meridian you're targeting.

388
00:15:59,071 --> 00:16:00,071
It's that simple?

389
00:16:00,169 --> 00:16:00,982
Yes.

390
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,271
You see, acupuncture is easy to learn

391
00:16:02,951 --> 00:16:04,030
and hard to forget.

392
00:16:05,191 --> 00:16:07,230
It's as if a splinter in the flesh,
a polluted material,

393
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:09,790
a knot,

394
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:11,200
and a blocked stream.

395
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:12,951
It's that simple.

396
00:16:13,751 --> 00:16:15,110
In a family setting,

397
00:16:15,271 --> 00:16:17,831
we can use fingers instead of needles.

398
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:19,951
If we teach the patients how to do it,

399
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:22,751
they won't need to visit the hospital.

400
00:16:24,391 --> 00:16:25,263
Professor Ren,

401
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,071
thank you.

402
00:16:27,071 --> 00:16:28,071
Don't mention it.

403
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:30,110
Professor Ren,

404
00:16:30,831 --> 00:16:32,071
I think

405
00:16:32,071 --> 00:16:33,391
we're witnessing history here.

406
00:16:33,391 --> 00:16:34,247
That's right.

407
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,150
Is that boy

408
00:16:36,391 --> 00:16:37,470
your son?

409
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:38,951
He's a pretty filial child.

410
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:40,951
He's my student.

411
00:16:42,191 --> 00:16:43,311
He's just like my son.

412
00:16:44,951 --> 00:16:46,030
My son

413
00:16:46,191 --> 00:16:47,511
is treating patients

414
00:16:47,511 --> 00:16:48,790
in a village in Hubei.

415
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,910
You're a kind Samaritan.

416
00:16:50,951 --> 00:16:51,910
Your entire family

417
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:53,710
are kind Samaritans.

418
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,391
Thank you for the compliment.

419
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,191
I'll get you some Chinese medicine.

420
00:17:01,191 --> 00:17:02,099
Rest well.

421
00:17:04,831 --> 00:17:05,710
Professor Ren,

422
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:08,271
what are you feeding

423
00:17:08,271 --> 00:17:09,511
my husband with?

424
00:17:09,751 --> 00:17:12,191
This is a herbal medicine soup
I prescribed to combat the epidemic.

425
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,311
You have to drink it too.

426
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:15,751
Here you go.

427
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,735
Thank you.

428
00:17:16,831 --> 00:17:18,030
Professor Ren.

429
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:19,071
Come here for a second.

430
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,919
Professor Ren,

431
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:24,951
I know that TCM focuses on

432
00:17:24,951 --> 00:17:26,391
observation, auscultation and olfaction,
inquiry, and pulse reading.

433
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:28,150
But now, we don't even know

434
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:29,271
what the virus is about.

435
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,550
Yet, you're feeding them
herbal medicine soup.

436
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,191
And, all of them are taking
the same soup.

437
00:17:32,391 --> 00:17:34,071
I'm afraid this doesn't make sense.

438
00:17:34,071 --> 00:17:35,631
I have no time to explain it to you.

439
00:17:35,631 --> 00:17:36,670
You can take it if you're willing.

440
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:38,391
Look at how many patients
we have out there.

441
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:39,511
And, it's cold.

442
00:17:39,751 --> 00:17:40,631
Their condition will worsen

443
00:17:40,631 --> 00:17:41,790
when they queue outside.

444
00:17:42,305 --> 00:17:43,177
You can make the call yourself.

445
00:17:43,511 --> 00:17:44,427
But...

446
00:17:46,831 --> 00:17:47,751
How do you feel?

447
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,951
Dad, Mum, it's cold outside.

448
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:58,391
I brought you two back with me

449
00:17:58,391 --> 00:17:59,910
as this year is pretty hectic.

450
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:01,790
Okay.

451
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,350
You guys haven't met
your granddaughter yet, right?

452
00:18:05,391 --> 00:18:06,470
Granddaughter?

453
00:18:10,074 --> 00:18:11,029
Tou Tou.

454
00:18:11,271 --> 00:18:12,670
Come and greet your grandparents.

455
00:18:15,751 --> 00:18:16,631
Hello, Grandpa, Granny.

456
00:18:17,071 --> 00:18:18,871
I'm Mr Ren's student.

457
00:18:19,071 --> 00:18:20,350
I'll leave your luggage here.

458
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,232
I'll make a move first.

459
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:24,150
This girl is something else.

460
00:18:25,713 --> 00:18:26,513
Tou Tou!

461
00:18:26,831 --> 00:18:28,910
-Tou Tou!
-I'm going to visit Senior Uncle.

462
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,732
Over here.

463
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,350
Send it to Mr Ren right now.

464
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,590
They're in urgent need of it.

465
00:19:26,631 --> 00:19:27,511
-Okay?
-Okay.

466
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,710
And,

467
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,511
you shouldn't place the goggles here.

468
00:19:31,991 --> 00:19:33,271
You shouldn't put something
on top of them.

469
00:19:33,271 --> 00:19:34,710
Put them at the top.

470
00:19:34,751 --> 00:19:35,440
-Okay.
-That's right.

471
00:19:35,514 --> 00:19:36,400
Get this moved up.

472
00:19:36,991 --> 00:19:38,031
Thank you.

473
00:19:40,271 --> 00:19:41,271
Let me check this side.

474
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,871
By the way, has Tian Zhen contacted you?

475
00:19:43,871 --> 00:19:44,911
Do they need any supplies?

476
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,391
He's doing fine over there.

477
00:19:46,391 --> 00:19:47,551
It's a small village after all.

478
00:19:47,751 --> 00:19:49,470
Now, our main focus is Wuhan.

479
00:19:49,871 --> 00:19:50,911
Li Quan told me

480
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:52,911
that even a piece of dust sheet

481
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:53,830
is precious to them.

482
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:55,271
Our medical team

483
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:57,151
will be bringing everything
we can bring to them.

484
00:19:57,991 --> 00:19:59,871
Wait, didn't you join the medical team?

485
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:00,991
I did register my name.

486
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:02,230
But they rejected me.

487
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,391
Those on the medical team

488
00:20:03,391 --> 00:20:04,430
are from the Department of
Infection Control, Pulmonology,

489
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,350
Anaesthesiology, Intensive Care,
and so on.

490
00:20:06,751 --> 00:20:08,271
I'm sure there will be sick children
over there too.

491
00:20:08,271 --> 00:20:09,590
Somehow, they don't need someone
from the Department of Paediatrics.

492
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:10,631
If I must say,

493
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:13,511
besides their departments, their status
should be considered too.

494
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:14,991
A loner like me

495
00:20:14,991 --> 00:20:16,110
without any commitments

496
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,871
should be prioritised
and sent to the frontline.

497
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,871
Nonsense. What are you saying?

498
00:20:20,271 --> 00:20:21,470
All volunteers

499
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:23,110
will depart safely

500
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:24,271
and return safely.

501
00:20:24,271 --> 00:20:25,631
Look at what you're saying.
You're making it as if

502
00:20:25,631 --> 00:20:26,511
no one

503
00:20:26,511 --> 00:20:27,710
cares about you.

504
00:20:27,871 --> 00:20:29,110
Yeah, you're right.

505
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:30,230
Everyone has to be safe

506
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,107
and sound.

507
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,950
I just think that this is the moment

508
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,031
I've been waiting for

509
00:20:34,142 --> 00:20:35,022
when I decided to study medicine.

510
00:20:36,511 --> 00:20:38,391
Now that I think about it,

511
00:20:38,391 --> 00:20:39,470
it would've been a success for me

512
00:20:40,151 --> 00:20:41,031
to take care of myself

513
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:42,230
before I studied TCM.

514
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:43,830
But now that I've studied TCM,

515
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:45,430
I try to dedicate myself

516
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:47,230
to the well-being of the public.

517
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:48,710
Dedicate yourself to the well-being
of the public?

518
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:50,230
You're learning TCM with your own money.

519
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:51,052
You're resting on
your past achievements.

520
00:20:51,871 --> 00:20:53,070
Alright. What about this?

521
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:55,230
You can go ahead.
I'll settle the delivery fee.

522
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:56,710
No need to go. Come back.

523
00:20:56,871 --> 00:20:58,070
I went there already.

524
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,871
They said the delivery fee will
be waived if they are to be delivered

525
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:02,110
to the epidemic zone.

526
00:21:02,991 --> 00:21:03,997
Really?

527
00:21:37,511 --> 00:21:39,031
Mr Ren, I'll tend to it.

528
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:39,991
You should take a nap.

529
00:21:40,742 --> 00:21:41,622
Tend to your pots.

530
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,911
It's been a few days since you rested.

531
00:21:44,391 --> 00:21:45,271
You're not made of iron.

532
00:21:45,325 --> 00:21:46,151
You should take a nap.

533
00:21:46,391 --> 00:21:47,190
Leave this to me.

534
00:21:47,391 --> 00:21:48,391
It's a race against time.

535
00:21:49,031 --> 00:21:50,190
Every second counts.

536
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:52,710
Mr Ren, please listen to me.

537
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,350
It's been a few days since you slept.

538
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:57,470
Don't talk to me.

539
00:21:58,551 --> 00:22:00,230
I still need to reply to
Tou Tou's text later.

540
00:22:01,511 --> 00:22:02,991
I need to tell her the treatment plan
for Wu Shan Dao.

541
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,671
Tou Tou should be asleep by this time.

542
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,710
She won't go to sleep
before answering my call.

543
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,230
-Mr Ren, I'm begging you...
-Get back to work.

544
00:23:01,991 --> 00:23:02,872
Dear.

545
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:05,070
I brought your parents
from Yunnan to our home.

546
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:06,991
The four elders are staying together.

547
00:23:06,991 --> 00:23:07,871
They can take care of each other.

548
00:23:14,511 --> 00:23:15,511
Dear, it must've been tough on you.

549
00:23:18,871 --> 00:23:19,791
Initially, I wanted to

550
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:21,110
bring Tou Tou back too.

551
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:21,991
But she's not willing to come back.

552
00:23:22,271 --> 00:23:23,911
She said she wanted
to take care of Wu Shan Dao.

553
00:23:26,271 --> 00:23:27,107
(Just ignore her.)

554
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:28,349
(Let her be.)

555
00:23:31,271 --> 00:23:32,751
How's the situation over there?

556
00:23:32,991 --> 00:23:33,872
(Did they seal off the city?)

557
00:23:34,751 --> 00:23:35,631
(Do you guys lack any food supplies?)

558
00:23:37,391 --> 00:23:38,710
It's terrible here.

559
00:23:39,391 --> 00:23:40,911
What about the family?

560
00:23:44,871 --> 00:23:46,350
I just had to fight for food

561
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,465
every 12am.

562
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:48,631
That's all there is to it.

563
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:50,391
Our community has sealed off
the entrance.

564
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,310
No one is allowed
to enter or exit the area.

565
00:23:52,871 --> 00:23:55,271
(Do you need me to send
more students there to help you?)

566
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,350
Just stay at home

567
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,230
and don't go anywhere.

568
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:01,871
That's the biggest help you can offer.

569
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,480
(Ren Xin Zheng)

570
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:10,830
The patients on this name list

571
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:12,991
have to be transferred to
a Grade A tertiary hospital by today.

572
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,671
There's no way to do so.
They don't have any space over there.

573
00:25:14,671 --> 00:25:15,991
If so, the first three must be
transferred there.

574
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:22,110
All three of them
must be transferred there.

575
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:23,350
There's no way to do so.

576
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:26,177
You're coughing?

577
00:25:26,871 --> 00:25:27,732
I'm fine.

578
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:30,871
There are too many patients there.

579
00:25:31,631 --> 00:25:33,871
I won't joke around with my health.

580
00:25:34,488 --> 00:25:35,442
You should go.

581
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:37,230
Alright. I understand.

582
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,708
Take care, okay?

583
00:26:16,871 --> 00:26:17,991
I'll get you some herbal medicine soup.

584
00:26:27,751 --> 00:26:28,991
Here you go.

585
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:30,350
Okay.

586
00:26:30,727 --> 00:26:32,151
I was waiting for this.

587
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:38,310
What's wrong with you?

588
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:39,991
Are you coughing as well?

589
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:42,751
Come, let me check your pulse.

590
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,848
Lower your volume.

591
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,391
Don't let him hear that.

592
00:26:45,991 --> 00:26:47,631
How long has it been
since you started coughing?

593
00:26:48,271 --> 00:26:49,631
Were there any symptoms?

594
00:26:50,991 --> 00:26:52,151
Not too long ago.

595
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:55,710
My chest just feels stuffy.

596
00:26:57,871 --> 00:27:00,271
You mustn't tell him about it.

597
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:03,271
You mustn't.

598
00:27:04,151 --> 00:27:04,950
Don't worry.

599
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:15,070
You need acupuncture treatment.

600
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:17,350
This is quite a huge deal.

601
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:19,230
Okay.

602
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:20,551
Later,

603
00:27:20,871 --> 00:27:22,070
I'll receive the treatment
in the corridor.

604
00:27:25,751 --> 00:27:27,190
Once he's hospitalised,

605
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,991
I'll get myself quarantined
in the mobile cabin hospital.

606
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:30,391
I'll be fine by then.

607
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,200
I've also received

608
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:37,271
notice of quarantine from
the mobile cabin hospital.

609
00:27:37,991 --> 00:27:38,927
They said

610
00:27:39,151 --> 00:27:40,671
I could be admitted tomorrow.

611
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:49,710
What a beautiful sunrise.

612
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:53,470
I just don't know

613
00:27:54,391 --> 00:27:55,631
if this will be my last time

614
00:27:56,751 --> 00:27:59,271
seeing the sunrise.

615
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:11,294
What's wrong with you?

616
00:28:14,511 --> 00:28:15,443
What's wrong with you?

617
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:21,751
Professor Ren!

618
00:28:33,871 --> 00:28:34,751
What did you say?

619
00:28:34,751 --> 00:28:35,871
Your father fainted?

620
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,151
Did he get infected?

621
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:40,151
Li Quan said he gave him the test.

622
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:41,021
It wasn't the coronavirus.

623
00:28:41,271 --> 00:28:42,391
He thinks that
Dad is just too exhausted.

624
00:28:42,991 --> 00:28:44,070
(He did everything himself.)

625
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,271
(His body is heaty.)

626
00:28:46,751 --> 00:28:47,544
If so,

627
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:48,710
does he have a fever?

628
00:28:49,201 --> 00:28:50,106
(Yes, he has a high fever.)

629
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:52,070
(Even so, he still insists on
brewing the medicine himself.)

630
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:55,997
Dr Ren!

631
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:57,511
(Tell your father
to take the test again.)

632
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:00,751
The first test might not be accurate.

633
00:29:01,631 --> 00:29:03,110
Mum, I'll hang up first.
There's a patient coming in.

634
00:29:15,536 --> 00:29:16,466
What's the matter?

635
00:29:17,751 --> 00:29:19,751
Did Xin Zheng get infected?

636
00:29:27,991 --> 00:29:28,791
You should head there then.

637
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:34,830
Head to where Xin Zheng is.

638
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,470
You've been distracted

639
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:39,271
for the past few days.

640
00:29:39,751 --> 00:29:40,991
Your heart is with him.

641
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:43,122
Go now.

642
00:29:45,391 --> 00:29:46,185
He...

643
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:48,271
He doesn't allow me to go.

644
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,230
So what?

645
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:52,271
You're a doctor.

646
00:29:52,817 --> 00:29:53,692
You should go.

647
00:29:54,391 --> 00:29:56,070
Right now, our country
needs all the talent they can get.

648
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:00,151
But what about you guys?

649
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:02,271
Your father and I are perfectly healthy.

650
00:30:02,871 --> 00:30:03,896
Don't worry.

651
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:07,991
Xin Zheng already
entrusted his parents to me.

652
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:09,710
We'll take care of them.

653
00:30:11,991 --> 00:30:14,070
Your father and I have been practising
medicine for 60 years.

654
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:14,991
Why are you still worried about us?

655
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:18,830
That's not it.

656
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:22,151
What's the issue then?

657
00:30:26,391 --> 00:30:28,070
Wuhan has been sealed off.

658
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:29,391
How can I get inside?

659
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,871
You're making me panic.

660
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:35,190
Do you want to go there or not?

661
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:39,110
It's easy then.

662
00:30:39,751 --> 00:30:40,631
When there's a will,

663
00:30:40,631 --> 00:30:41,511
there's a way.

664
00:30:42,751 --> 00:30:44,110
It's easy for you to say.

665
00:30:46,871 --> 00:30:49,110
This is the invitation letter
sent to our medical centre

666
00:30:50,391 --> 00:30:51,911
by Jiang'an District's local authority.

667
00:30:52,511 --> 00:30:53,430
Take this with you.

668
00:30:57,096 --> 00:30:58,013
Your mother and I

669
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:59,271
have dealt with the procedures

670
00:30:59,271 --> 00:31:00,671
two days ago.

671
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:02,271
Go now.

672
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:07,177
Hurry up.

673
00:31:12,881 --> 00:31:13,700
Alright now.

674
00:31:14,185 --> 00:31:15,624
Don't worry about the family.

675
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,640
(Jiangzhou People's Hospital)

676
00:31:20,751 --> 00:31:22,120
(Master, can you see this?)

677
00:31:22,271 --> 00:31:23,110
(Can you see this?)

678
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,263
(Look.)

679
00:31:24,751 --> 00:31:25,700
(Look!)

680
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,230
He can stand now?

681
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,400
(Yeah. He stood up all of a sudden.)

682
00:31:33,425 --> 00:31:34,246
(I was surprised.)

683
00:31:34,271 --> 00:31:35,430
I was taken aback.

684
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:36,310
Look.

685
00:31:36,631 --> 00:31:37,991
(Tell him to be careful.)

686
00:31:37,991 --> 00:31:39,310
Now,

687
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:40,631
he lacks a braincase.

688
00:31:40,631 --> 00:31:42,470
You need to put a helmet on his head.

689
00:31:43,391 --> 00:31:44,310
Got it.

690
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:45,865
I'll let him choose the colour
when I head back.

691
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,279
He can choose it himself.

692
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:49,830
By the way, Master...

693
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:52,511
Be careful.

694
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:55,950
(You see, when we first worshipped
our predecessors,)

695
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:58,751
(you said spring was here)

696
00:31:58,751 --> 00:32:00,151
even though the temperature was low.

697
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:01,350
However, the air of spring

698
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:02,631
is different from the air of winter.

699
00:32:02,871 --> 00:32:04,871
(Back then, I thought you were
spouting nonsense.)

700
00:32:04,871 --> 00:32:06,230
(Spring and winter together? Nonsense.)

701
00:32:07,036 --> 00:32:07,840
(But today,)

702
00:32:07,871 --> 00:32:09,230
(I feel the air of spring.)

703
00:32:11,486 --> 00:32:12,497
That's good.

704
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:14,950
Tell me then.

705
00:32:16,151 --> 00:32:17,230
How do you feel?

706
00:32:18,713 --> 00:32:19,560
(Well,)

707
00:32:19,751 --> 00:32:20,871
(today's the Beginning of Spring.)

708
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,600
At night, it felt damp.

709
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:25,110
Maybe it's because

710
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,631
the air on the ground became warm.

711
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:27,751
That means

712
00:32:27,751 --> 00:32:29,271
you didn't lie to me.

713
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:31,590
It wasn't me.

714
00:32:32,631 --> 00:32:34,511
(It was Heaven and Earth.)

715
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:36,110
So, Heaven and Earth never lie, huh?

716
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:39,110
As fall departs without return,

717
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:42,511
spring falls as the next season.

718
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:44,631
You two are uncultured.

719
00:32:46,991 --> 00:32:47,950
Shan Dao.

720
00:32:48,991 --> 00:32:50,470
You old ingrate.

721
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:52,470
So,

722
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:54,470
(you're forgetting about
the person who treated you)

723
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:56,511
now that you've almost
fully recovered, huh?

724
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:58,110
(Precisely.)

725
00:33:04,271 --> 00:33:05,590
(Tou Tou, you've improved a lot.)

726
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:08,732
Your sense

727
00:33:09,391 --> 00:33:10,590
has been sharpened by a lot.

728
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:13,151
You're much more observant

729
00:33:13,991 --> 00:33:14,871
(of your surroundings now.)

730
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:17,310
Wait, Master.

731
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:19,470
Why are you coughing?

732
00:33:19,991 --> 00:33:21,391
It isn't coughing season yet.

733
00:33:21,871 --> 00:33:23,350
(Don't tell me you're infected?)

734
00:33:24,751 --> 00:33:26,230
Mind your words.

735
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:33,911
(I feel unwell today.)

736
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,470
(I'll hang up first.)

737
00:33:36,391 --> 00:33:37,470
(I'm not done yet.)

738
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:42,771
Hello?

739
00:33:44,871 --> 00:33:45,950
That was fast.

740
00:33:49,991 --> 00:33:51,110
Senior Uncle,

741
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:52,871
I feel

742
00:33:52,871 --> 00:33:54,031
uneasy.

743
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:56,631
Don't tell me

744
00:33:56,631 --> 00:33:57,991
Master is infected?

745
00:33:58,631 --> 00:33:59,991
Stop jinxing him.

746
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:01,427
He won't get infected.

747
00:34:02,391 --> 00:34:03,230
Don't worry.

748
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:17,710
That's the situation.

749
00:34:18,391 --> 00:34:20,151
I'll depart for Wuhan immediately.

750
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,080
(As for the medical centre,)

751
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:22,590
(Xiao Hong, Zhu Xia,)

752
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:23,871
(please take care of it.)

753
00:34:24,151 --> 00:34:26,310
Ms Song, don't worry.

754
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:28,590
(The medical centre is closed.)

755
00:34:28,857 --> 00:34:29,677
(Everyone will stay at home)

756
00:34:29,991 --> 00:34:31,751
(if they have nothing to do.)

757
00:34:31,751 --> 00:34:32,991
(We won't go outside for no reason.)

758
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:35,391
Madam, remember to keep in touch.

759
00:34:35,391 --> 00:34:36,230
You must take care of yourself too.

760
00:34:36,391 --> 00:34:37,991
(If you need any help)

761
00:34:37,991 --> 00:34:39,470
(or have encountered any issues,)

762
00:34:39,671 --> 00:34:40,710
(just tell us.)

763
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:41,710
(We'll think of something.)

764
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:42,710
If we find something

765
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:44,470
that's effective,

766
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:45,871
we'll share it in the group chat.

767
00:34:45,991 --> 00:34:47,751
(Do we have any confirmed cases
in the medical centre?)

768
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:50,110
Not yet for now.

769
00:34:50,271 --> 00:34:51,151
However,

770
00:34:51,151 --> 00:34:52,791
I do have some friends
who live near Wuhan.

771
00:34:52,791 --> 00:34:54,470
Anyway, they're getting infected

772
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:55,470
one by one.

773
00:34:55,631 --> 00:34:56,430
(There are also sporadic cases)

774
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:57,631
(appearing overseas right now.)

775
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,310
(I'm very worried.)

776
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:01,230
You don't need to worry.

777
00:35:01,511 --> 00:35:03,230
Jiangzhou is still safe.

778
00:35:03,871 --> 00:35:05,230
(That's not what I'm worried about.)

779
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:06,631
Now, I have a sense of

780
00:35:06,631 --> 00:35:07,430
helplessness.

781
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:10,470
You guys are already on the frontline,

782
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:11,310
yet we can only

783
00:35:11,991 --> 00:35:12,830
stay here.

784
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:14,991
We don't know how we can
help you guys out too.

785
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:19,590
I have an idea.

786
00:35:20,871 --> 00:35:22,830
Tell Ms Song then. Here.

787
00:35:24,271 --> 00:35:25,911
(Ms Song, Hong,)

788
00:35:26,151 --> 00:35:27,271
(I have an idea.)

789
00:35:27,751 --> 00:35:28,551
You see,

790
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:29,950
I have a chat group
with my fellow patients.

791
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:31,631
We cheer each other up

792
00:35:31,631 --> 00:35:33,031
in the group.

793
00:35:33,271 --> 00:35:34,230
(However,)

794
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:35,830
(everyone is panicking lately.)

795
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:37,751
(And, some of them have
already been infected.)

796
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:39,950
(They couldn't find any places
that could treat their condition,)

797
00:35:39,991 --> 00:35:42,350
(especially when they are just like me,)

798
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:44,271
who experiences issues
in moving from one place to another.

799
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:46,470
And, some of them are abroad too.

800
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:48,150
They're very scared.

801
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,670
Can we gather

802
00:35:49,751 --> 00:35:50,670
all those who're infected

803
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:52,111
(and couldn't find a place)

804
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,351
(to treat their condition?)

805
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:54,430
(The physicians in our medical centre)

806
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:56,351
(are at home anyway.)

807
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:57,511
(Why don't we provide them)

808
00:35:57,511 --> 00:35:59,390
with some help and assistance online?

809
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,324
At least

810
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:01,351
we shouldn't let them feel

811
00:36:01,351 --> 00:36:02,470
that as if they've been abandoned.

812
00:36:03,111 --> 00:36:04,950
(I think that's a great idea.)

813
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,111
(If we do so,)

814
00:36:06,111 --> 00:36:07,430
(at least we can provide them)

815
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:08,910
(with some mental support.)

816
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:11,271
However, it's best
if we have a Western doctor too.

817
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:12,390
We can combine both fields.

818
00:36:12,751 --> 00:36:14,351
Why don't I call
Peng Shi Yan to join us?

819
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,677
(Okay.)

820
00:36:15,831 --> 00:36:17,710
Yang, for this activity,

821
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:18,950
you and Peng will lead it.

822
00:36:19,351 --> 00:36:20,230
Call Tian Zhen to join you guys too.

823
00:36:20,351 --> 00:36:21,751
Tian Zhen has practical experience.

824
00:36:22,271 --> 00:36:23,791
He can share them with the group.

825
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:25,325
(Anyway,)

826
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:26,870
(we need to do everything we can)

827
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:28,470
(to help out those in need.)

828
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:29,630
Okay.

829
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:31,111
Madam, take care.

830
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,870
I'll contact them now.

831
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:37,560
Alright, Ms Song.

832
00:36:37,991 --> 00:36:39,991
This is a great idea.

833
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:41,831
I'll create a group chat later.

834
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:43,390
Remember to take
your protective measures

835
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:44,591
when you're there.

836
00:36:47,071 --> 00:36:48,190
I'll create the group now.

837
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,075
(Edit group chat name)

838
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,850
(Coronavirus Support Group)

839
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,200
(Hi, everyone. I'm Dr Peng.
I will try my best to help you all.)

840
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,123
(Wuhan Second Yangtze River Bridge)

841
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:38,751
What are you doing here again?

842
00:37:39,831 --> 00:37:40,771
Go now.

843
00:37:41,271 --> 00:37:42,111
I'm fine here.

844
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:44,591
Get back to work.

845
00:37:53,936 --> 00:37:54,888
Mr Ren.

846
00:38:18,887 --> 00:38:19,825
Wait.

847
00:38:24,351 --> 00:38:25,351
What are you doing here?

848
00:38:32,591 --> 00:38:33,751
Our family is doing fine.

849
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:35,247
Don't worry.

850
00:38:36,799 --> 00:38:37,715
-Okay.
-Don't worry.

851
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:45,430
That's a serious cough you have there.

852
00:38:47,831 --> 00:38:48,654
I'm fine.

853
00:38:50,511 --> 00:38:53,271
I already did the test twice.

854
00:38:55,017 --> 00:38:55,865
It was negative both times.

855
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:05,190
Judging from the sound of your cough,

856
00:39:06,071 --> 00:39:07,190
it sounds like a lung abscess.

857
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:18,910
I have too many patients

858
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,607
to tend to.

859
00:39:24,202 --> 00:39:25,146
I know.

860
00:39:28,122 --> 00:39:28,951
I'm here.

861
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,511
Leave your patients to me.

862
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,879
Okay.

863
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,872
(Song Ling Lan)

864
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:52,429
(Jiangzhou People's Hospital)

865
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:56,470
I recorded a set of hand techniques
that can help to stop coughs.

866
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:58,031
I'll send it to the group later.

867
00:40:58,190 --> 00:40:59,630
And, I'll add Ms Dong

868
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:00,511
into the group later

869
00:41:00,511 --> 00:41:02,071
so that she can guide the members.

870
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:04,390
Tell all patients in the group

871
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:05,351
to practice it.

872
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:11,751
There's no prescription at all.

873
00:41:12,071 --> 00:41:12,910
Peng Shi Yan said

874
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:14,150
that it's time for Wang Shu Qing

875
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:15,511
to take his antibiotics.

876
00:41:19,271 --> 00:41:20,670
There are no antibiotics here.

877
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:21,710
We only have hand techniques.

878
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:23,230
Tell him to get to work first.

879
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,670
Tell him to not let
his imagination run wild.

880
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:25,910
It'll make things worse.

881
00:41:26,271 --> 00:41:27,670
Give him a hot water foot bath later.

882
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:33,950
Alright, got it.

883
00:41:34,991 --> 00:41:35,896
That's all for now.

884
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:40,031
You're slacking off

885
00:41:40,071 --> 00:41:41,271
when I'm not monitoring you, huh?

886
00:41:41,271 --> 00:41:42,670
This is exhausting. Let me take a break.

887
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:43,511
No breaks for you.

888
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:44,910
-Come on.
-Okay.

889
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:45,870
How could you rest
when you just started?

890
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:46,849
Come, let's continue.

891
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:48,071
Your tummy

892
00:41:48,111 --> 00:41:49,470
is getting bigger and bigger.

893
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:50,311
Hurry up.

894
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:55,991
(Tian Zhen, grab a pen
and a piece of paper.)

895
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:57,351
(Write down the prescription.)

896
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:58,755
Please go ahead.

897
00:41:58,991 --> 00:42:00,031
(Chinese ephedra, six grams.)

898
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:01,751
(Poria cocos, 15 grams.)

899
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:03,071
(Almond, nine grams.)

900
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:05,670
(Chinese Thorawax Root, 15 grams.)

901
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:07,950
(Scutellaria baicalensis, six grams.)

902
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:10,511
(Prepared Liquorice Root, five grams.)

903
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:11,511
(Raw ginger,)

904
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:13,497
(ten grams.)

905
00:42:14,751 --> 00:42:16,430
This is a prescription
specifically for the epidemic.

906
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:17,791
I asked my father already.

907
00:42:17,991 --> 00:42:19,751
He said we could roast brown rice
until it turns golden brown

908
00:42:19,751 --> 00:42:20,551
and make porridge with them.

909
00:42:20,551 --> 00:42:21,591
It invigorates the spleen
and dispels dampness.

910
00:42:21,591 --> 00:42:22,751
It's helpful against this illness.

911
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:24,470
I'll organise it into an article

912
00:42:24,511 --> 00:42:25,430
and publish it

913
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:26,302
on the public account right away.

914
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,498
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

915
00:42:36,609 --> 00:42:38,000
(are referenced from relevant
traditional Chinese medicine books)

916
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,480
(Do not use without medical advice)
