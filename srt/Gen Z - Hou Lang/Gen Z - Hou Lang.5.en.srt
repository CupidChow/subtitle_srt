1
00:00:03,858 --> 00:00:04,938
Did that girl die?

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,609
Nonsense.
Stop jinxing it.

3
00:00:06,689 --> 00:00:07,735
We saved her.

4
00:00:07,818 --> 00:00:10,007
You had me for a second there.
What's with the long face then?

5
00:00:10,217 --> 00:00:12,538
One of her Fallopian tubes was removed.

6
00:00:15,578 --> 00:00:17,937
How many Fallopian tubes
does a woman have?

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,095
Two.

8
00:00:19,178 --> 00:00:20,415
That means she has one left, right?

9
00:00:20,498 --> 00:00:21,498
That's fine, right?

10
00:00:23,537 --> 00:00:24,854
What illness does she have?

11
00:00:24,937 --> 00:00:27,258
My nephew and niece-in-law
were quite nervous about it.

12
00:00:28,258 --> 00:00:29,258
It's eccyesis.

13
00:00:30,457 --> 00:00:31,457
Eccyesis?

14
00:00:32,257 --> 00:00:33,297
She's so young.

15
00:00:33,698 --> 00:00:34,615
But she...

16
00:00:34,698 --> 00:00:35,735
She had eccyesis...

17
00:00:35,818 --> 00:00:36,818
Tou Tou,

18
00:00:37,097 --> 00:00:38,174
when it comes to being laid back,

19
00:00:38,257 --> 00:00:39,257
no one can rival you.

20
00:00:51,338 --> 00:00:53,494
Why are you three so tensed up?

21
00:00:53,577 --> 00:00:55,360
It's not like you guys made her pregnant.

22
00:00:55,978 --> 00:00:57,737
Every debt has its debtor, right?

23
00:00:57,897 --> 00:00:59,095
From an objective perspective,

24
00:00:59,178 --> 00:01:00,455
you guys did a good deed.

25
00:01:00,538 --> 00:01:01,975
It's a good deed, you know?

26
00:01:02,058 --> 00:01:03,058
You did something good.

27
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:08,763
Looks like you're discouraged.

28
00:01:09,698 --> 00:01:11,133
If so, should we try to save them

29
00:01:11,458 --> 00:01:13,154
if we get caught in the same situation?

30
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:14,458
I think Tian Zhen

31
00:01:14,817 --> 00:01:16,035
doesn't know what to do now.

32
00:01:19,418 --> 00:01:20,636
It's not that big of a deal.

33
00:01:22,058 --> 00:01:23,058
Tian Zhen,

34
00:01:23,338 --> 00:01:24,418
listen.

35
00:01:26,537 --> 00:01:28,338
I think, in life,

36
00:01:28,817 --> 00:01:30,418
we deserve to be forgiven

37
00:01:30,897 --> 00:01:32,767
as long as we don't harm
someone on purpose.

38
00:01:35,073 --> 00:01:35,975
Just like me.

39
00:01:36,058 --> 00:01:37,094
Even if I did break someone's bones,

40
00:01:37,177 --> 00:01:38,617
I stood up for what was right.

41
00:01:38,897 --> 00:01:40,978
You can't include that
in my dark history.

42
00:01:41,537 --> 00:01:42,454
We need to look at

43
00:01:42,537 --> 00:01:44,897
the bright side of life.

44
00:01:46,617 --> 00:01:47,617
Stop blaming yourself.

45
00:01:53,058 --> 00:01:54,895
If we encounter such a situation again,

46
00:01:54,978 --> 00:01:57,094
we should do what we need to do.

47
00:01:57,177 --> 00:01:59,534
Just like the song, we need to
brave the nine continents.

48
00:01:59,617 --> 00:02:00,748
Brave the nine continents.

49
00:02:01,338 --> 00:02:02,658
Brave the nine continents.

50
00:02:03,537 --> 00:02:04,537
-Brave...
-Tou Tou.

51
00:02:06,058 --> 00:02:07,319
You should stop studying TCM.

52
00:02:07,778 --> 00:02:09,257
I'm serious. You're a great cook.

53
00:02:09,457 --> 00:02:10,858
You should cook for us instead.

54
00:02:13,897 --> 00:02:15,014
That's the reason

55
00:02:15,097 --> 00:02:16,218
I came here.

56
00:02:17,338 --> 00:02:18,338
Take a look.

57
00:02:18,537 --> 00:02:20,016
What do you want to have tomorrow?

58
00:02:22,817 --> 00:02:25,209
There's nothing more important
than filling one's tummy.

59
00:02:25,489 --> 00:02:26,255
Wait, Tian Zhen.

60
00:02:26,338 --> 00:02:28,534
The two abalones you said yesterday,

61
00:02:28,617 --> 00:02:29,814
what are they?

62
00:02:29,897 --> 00:02:31,215
What are two abalones?

63
00:02:31,298 --> 00:02:32,698
Twin abalones.

64
00:02:33,418 --> 00:02:34,418
Twin abalones?

65
00:02:34,617 --> 00:02:35,978
Twin abalones?

66
00:02:37,058 --> 00:02:39,319
That means there are two heads
on the abalone, right?

67
00:02:40,609 --> 00:02:41,454
You...

68
00:02:41,537 --> 00:02:42,336
You're trying to deceive me, huh?

69
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:43,895
You're deceiving me because
I never had abalone before.

70
00:02:43,978 --> 00:02:45,500
But I really never had them before.

71
00:02:45,938 --> 00:02:47,243
Where can I buy twin abalones?

72
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,120
(Alternative Medicine)

73
00:03:53,218 --> 00:03:54,218
Sun Tou Tou.

74
00:03:55,778 --> 00:03:56,778
Sun Tou Tou?

75
00:04:01,097 --> 00:04:02,097
Roubecca?

76
00:04:02,257 --> 00:04:04,657
You woke up earlier than a rooster.

77
00:04:06,338 --> 00:04:07,338
Hey,

78
00:04:07,498 --> 00:04:09,058
did you see my doll?

79
00:04:10,457 --> 00:04:11,457
Nope.

80
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,080
You!

81
00:04:23,217 --> 00:04:24,217
Wait.

82
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:25,858
Just lend it to me.

83
00:04:26,217 --> 00:04:27,858
I was using it to study last night.

84
00:04:29,377 --> 00:04:30,377
Just lend it to me.

85
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:32,458
If you wish to study,

86
00:04:32,777 --> 00:04:34,138
you can buy your own doll.

87
00:04:34,657 --> 00:04:36,497
If you take someone's belonging

88
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,217
without their permission,

89
00:04:38,497 --> 00:04:40,106
that means you're stealing from them.

90
00:04:41,618 --> 00:04:42,615
Wait.

91
00:04:42,698 --> 00:04:44,097
What do you mean by stealing?

92
00:04:44,497 --> 00:04:46,335
You're kicking up a huge fuss out of it.

93
00:04:46,418 --> 00:04:47,537
We're dormmates.

94
00:04:47,937 --> 00:04:49,981
You shouldn't just
keep your things to yourself.

95
00:04:50,217 --> 00:04:51,698
That's narrow-minded of you.

96
00:04:51,817 --> 00:04:52,854
You need to share your things.

97
00:04:52,937 --> 00:04:54,807
-I...
-Have you ever heard of a shared bike?

98
00:04:55,377 --> 00:04:56,935
Will you care about the next rider
after you ride the bike?

99
00:04:57,018 --> 00:04:58,018
You won't, right?

100
00:04:58,257 --> 00:04:59,910
You'll leave the bike there and leave.

101
00:05:00,057 --> 00:05:01,777
If you're truly upset about it,

102
00:05:02,937 --> 00:05:04,633
I'll return it to you. I don't need it.

103
00:05:06,937 --> 00:05:07,937
Roubecca.

104
00:05:08,097 --> 00:05:09,097
Roubecca.

105
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:11,545
What do you mean by this?

106
00:05:12,898 --> 00:05:14,217
Are you discarding it?

107
00:05:15,777 --> 00:05:17,937
If so, I'll take it then.

108
00:05:20,178 --> 00:05:21,961
This way, I won't need
to buy another one.

109
00:05:30,217 --> 00:05:31,337
I just wiped it.

110
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,640
Quan,

111
00:05:34,937 --> 00:05:35,937
thanks.

112
00:05:38,097 --> 00:05:39,014
Class Leader,

113
00:05:39,097 --> 00:05:40,358
I need to tell you something.

114
00:05:40,537 --> 00:05:42,057
Sun Tou Tou stole my belonging.

115
00:05:42,618 --> 00:05:43,574
What did she steal?

116
00:05:43,657 --> 00:05:44,575
I didn't steal it!

117
00:05:44,658 --> 00:05:45,698
I just took it.

118
00:05:46,337 --> 00:05:47,337
I took it.

119
00:05:47,898 --> 00:05:49,574
Taking other people's belonging
without permission

120
00:05:49,657 --> 00:05:51,217
is considered stealing.

121
00:05:52,898 --> 00:05:55,246
I guess you do have many belongings
that can be stolen.

122
00:05:55,337 --> 00:05:56,694
Your shirt alone costs tens of thousands.

123
00:05:56,777 --> 00:05:58,418
Tell me. What did she steal from you?

124
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:01,458
This.

125
00:06:01,657 --> 00:06:02,657
This is it?

126
00:06:02,777 --> 00:06:03,777
Yeah.

127
00:06:04,217 --> 00:06:05,574
I thought she stole something expensive.

128
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:07,097
It's just a mannequin, right?

129
00:06:07,698 --> 00:06:08,694
Don't be so petty.

130
00:06:08,777 --> 00:06:09,821
You two should share it.

131
00:06:10,657 --> 00:06:11,454
That's what I thought too.

132
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:12,537
We should share this.

133
00:06:14,057 --> 00:06:15,057
First,

134
00:06:15,337 --> 00:06:17,164
I don't like it when
people touch my stuff.

135
00:06:17,257 --> 00:06:18,257
Second,

136
00:06:18,898 --> 00:06:20,290
I don't like Sun Tou Tou either.

137
00:06:20,537 --> 00:06:22,217
I request a change of dorm.

138
00:06:22,777 --> 00:06:23,777
Sorry,

139
00:06:23,937 --> 00:06:25,097
but we're out of rooms.

140
00:06:27,898 --> 00:06:28,695
If so, we need

141
00:06:28,778 --> 00:06:29,996
to establish a set of rules.

142
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:31,657
From today onward,

143
00:06:31,937 --> 00:06:33,178
you cannot touch my things.

144
00:06:33,377 --> 00:06:34,174
All of it.

145
00:06:34,257 --> 00:06:35,257
Understood?

146
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,111
Tou Tou, what do you think?

147
00:06:37,257 --> 00:06:38,375
I'm very generous.

148
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:40,497
Anyway, I'll allow her
to touch my things.

149
00:06:41,337 --> 00:06:42,377
And, I think...

150
00:06:43,497 --> 00:06:44,497
Lift your butt.

151
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:46,738
We should at least be fair.

152
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:48,657
Don't worry.

153
00:06:48,817 --> 00:06:50,254
I won't touch your stuff.

154
00:06:50,337 --> 00:06:51,294
So, please don't touch

155
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:52,377
my stuff either.

156
00:06:52,978 --> 00:06:53,978
That's not right.

157
00:06:54,817 --> 00:06:56,294
It's a two-way relationship.

158
00:06:56,377 --> 00:06:58,337
How could you make the call alone?

159
00:06:59,898 --> 00:07:01,935
I allow you to take my things.

160
00:07:02,018 --> 00:07:04,055
You should allow me
to take your things too.

161
00:07:04,138 --> 00:07:05,182
That should be the case,

162
00:07:05,777 --> 00:07:06,815
am I right?

163
00:07:06,898 --> 00:07:07,815
Don't you think so?

164
00:07:07,898 --> 00:07:08,898
Morning, Mr Ren.

165
00:07:10,217 --> 00:07:11,217
Nephew.

166
00:07:11,537 --> 00:07:12,537
Mr Ren,

167
00:07:12,978 --> 00:07:13,695
I request permission

168
00:07:13,778 --> 00:07:15,895
to sleep in a different room
from Sun Tou Tou.

169
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:17,895
What about this? I'll sleep
at home every night.

170
00:07:17,978 --> 00:07:20,377
I promise I won't be late for class.

171
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:22,057
But why?

172
00:07:22,777 --> 00:07:23,694
I...

173
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:24,777
Mr Ren,

174
00:07:25,777 --> 00:07:27,738
I want to sleep at home too.

175
00:07:31,097 --> 00:07:32,298
Does anyone else

176
00:07:32,898 --> 00:07:34,029
want to sleep at home too?

177
00:07:47,418 --> 00:07:48,537
Ms Yang.

178
00:07:52,337 --> 00:07:53,418
Tell me.

179
00:07:54,097 --> 00:07:55,217
Why do you think

180
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:57,454
we have to live together

181
00:07:57,537 --> 00:07:59,294
in the first three months
of the apprentice class?

182
00:07:59,377 --> 00:08:00,682
Have you ever thought of that?

183
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:06,067
-Has anyone ever thought of that?
-Me!

184
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:12,657
Tell me.

185
00:08:26,418 --> 00:08:28,027
If you want to get your skills honed,

186
00:08:28,337 --> 00:08:29,598
you must never sleep at home.

187
00:08:31,898 --> 00:08:33,217
What's so funny?

188
00:08:36,298 --> 00:08:38,097
Sun Tou Tou's crude words

189
00:08:40,298 --> 00:08:41,657
carry fine ideas.

190
00:08:48,017 --> 00:08:50,017
If we don't live together,

191
00:08:51,457 --> 00:08:53,178
the flaws you have

192
00:08:54,217 --> 00:08:56,217
are considered a deviation in TCM.

193
00:08:56,657 --> 00:08:58,657
That means you're not
maintaining your virtues.

194
00:08:58,978 --> 00:09:00,574
TCM is different from Western medicine.

195
00:09:00,657 --> 00:09:02,655
Western medicine uses machines
to give diagnoses.

196
00:09:02,738 --> 00:09:03,897
Once the data is out,

197
00:09:04,657 --> 00:09:06,934
the machines will know what's different
about your body.

198
00:09:07,017 --> 00:09:07,775
It's different for TCM.

199
00:09:07,858 --> 00:09:08,858
We read pulses.

200
00:09:10,657 --> 00:09:12,814
The first thing you do
when you read pulses is to feel.

201
00:09:12,897 --> 00:09:13,978
The word "Gan", or feel,

202
00:09:14,978 --> 00:09:16,298
is very advanced

203
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:18,537
in the Chinese culture.

204
00:09:19,337 --> 00:09:21,175
In "Questions of Organic and
Fundamental Nature: The manifestation of

205
00:09:21,258 --> 00:09:23,374
Yin and Yang from
the macrocosm to the microcosm",

206
00:09:23,457 --> 00:09:24,657
there's this saying.

207
00:09:25,457 --> 00:09:27,694
With I as the measure,
I detect irregularity in others.

208
00:09:27,777 --> 00:09:30,169
Through observing the exterior,
I diagnose the interior.

209
00:09:30,697 --> 00:09:34,002
By observing the irregularities, the
severe can be diagnosed from the menial.

210
00:09:34,137 --> 00:09:36,694
If so, how can I diagnose your illness

211
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:39,017
just by reading your pulse?

212
00:09:39,657 --> 00:09:40,657
The word "I",

213
00:09:42,298 --> 00:09:43,646
that's our rule of measurement.

214
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:46,095
I'm sure you guys know what a ruler is.

215
00:09:46,178 --> 00:09:47,874
It's not straight unless you adjust it.

216
00:09:49,097 --> 00:09:50,750
If you measure something with a ruler,

217
00:09:51,217 --> 00:09:53,335
how can I know that if I'm measuring it

218
00:09:53,418 --> 00:09:55,457
straight or not?

219
00:09:56,097 --> 00:09:57,217
Who will tell me that?

220
00:09:59,337 --> 00:10:00,772
Your dormmate will tell you that.

221
00:10:02,137 --> 00:10:03,295
Your classmates and teachers

222
00:10:03,378 --> 00:10:04,457
will tell you that.

223
00:10:05,217 --> 00:10:08,295
When you live together
with them all day long,

224
00:10:08,378 --> 00:10:10,777
they'll detect your flaws.

225
00:10:10,897 --> 00:10:12,457
They'll tell you your flaws

226
00:10:13,017 --> 00:10:14,298
so that you can rectify them.

227
00:10:18,978 --> 00:10:19,978
To sum it up,

228
00:10:20,657 --> 00:10:22,136
we're living together all day long

229
00:10:22,978 --> 00:10:24,498
in the first three months

230
00:10:25,017 --> 00:10:28,014
of the apprentice class

231
00:10:28,097 --> 00:10:29,337
in order

232
00:10:29,978 --> 00:10:31,065
to know ourselves better.

233
00:10:48,137 --> 00:10:49,258
How much does this cost?

234
00:10:53,017 --> 00:10:54,017
75 yuan.

235
00:10:54,897 --> 00:10:56,418
For 75 yuan,

236
00:10:57,457 --> 00:10:59,217
Ms Yang has decided

237
00:10:59,897 --> 00:11:01,454
to learn how to handle

238
00:11:01,537 --> 00:11:04,457
her sour relationship with you
for a long period.

239
00:11:07,657 --> 00:11:09,694
The price isn't the issue here.

240
00:11:09,777 --> 00:11:11,299
If you wish to hold it against her,

241
00:11:11,738 --> 00:11:13,494
the price won't be the issue here.

242
00:11:13,577 --> 00:11:15,457
But if you try to be magnanimous
toward her,

243
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,454
it won't even be an issue.

244
00:11:17,537 --> 00:11:18,929
It'll cease to be an issue then.

245
00:11:33,897 --> 00:11:34,897
Tou Tou,

246
00:11:35,337 --> 00:11:37,738
why does Mr Ren always side with you?

247
00:11:40,017 --> 00:11:41,014
He's my nephew.

248
00:11:41,097 --> 00:11:42,374
According to our seniority,

249
00:11:42,457 --> 00:11:43,934
he has to side with me

250
00:11:44,017 --> 00:11:45,058
out of respect,

251
00:11:45,577 --> 00:11:46,577
don't you think?

252
00:11:53,298 --> 00:11:54,934
As the saying goes,
joy puts heart into a man.

253
00:11:55,017 --> 00:11:57,215
Mr Zheng, you're radiating with joy.

254
00:11:57,298 --> 00:11:58,454
Seems like you're confident

255
00:11:58,537 --> 00:12:01,160
that Hefeng Hall will
be listed by this year.

256
00:12:01,777 --> 00:12:03,855
I heard that the export sale
for your health drink

257
00:12:03,938 --> 00:12:06,134
doubled by this year.

258
00:12:06,217 --> 00:12:07,295
To be honest,

259
00:12:07,378 --> 00:12:08,574
our company used to focus on

260
00:12:08,657 --> 00:12:10,694
producing medicine and injectables.

261
00:12:10,777 --> 00:12:11,574
But that field

262
00:12:11,657 --> 00:12:12,694
is fiercely competitive.

263
00:12:12,777 --> 00:12:15,535
-You're right.
-We have no advantage if we compare with

264
00:12:15,618 --> 00:12:17,574
those billion-dollar
pharmaceutical enterprises.

265
00:12:17,657 --> 00:12:20,054
Two years ago, Mr Ren
gave a seminar in our company.

266
00:12:20,137 --> 00:12:21,814
I was enlightened after that seminar.

267
00:12:21,897 --> 00:12:24,054
I focused my effort on producing
healthcare products

268
00:12:24,137 --> 00:12:25,457
and supplements after that.

269
00:12:26,337 --> 00:12:28,254
He even improved the formula
for our drinks.

270
00:12:28,337 --> 00:12:29,574
If we do get listed,

271
00:12:29,657 --> 00:12:31,353
Mr Ren will be the biggest contributor.

272
00:12:32,457 --> 00:12:33,694
I came here

273
00:12:33,777 --> 00:12:35,258
to thank Mr Ren personally.

274
00:12:36,457 --> 00:12:38,066
Is he performing outpatient duty now?

275
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:39,895
Don't you know?

276
00:12:39,978 --> 00:12:41,895
Mr Ren has resigned from his post.

277
00:12:41,978 --> 00:12:45,134
He's holding a TCM apprentice class
outside of the academy.

278
00:12:45,217 --> 00:12:46,826
He resigned in order to hold a class?

279
00:12:48,457 --> 00:12:49,814
That's great.

280
00:12:49,897 --> 00:12:52,895
Coincidentally, our company intends

281
00:12:52,978 --> 00:12:54,295
to raise the sum of the student grant

282
00:12:54,378 --> 00:12:56,134
for poor students studying
in the University of TCM.

283
00:12:56,217 --> 00:12:57,895
We can use it to support
the apprentice class fully.

284
00:12:57,978 --> 00:12:59,457
Wait, Mr Zheng.

285
00:13:00,858 --> 00:13:02,978
What do you mean by that?

286
00:13:03,097 --> 00:13:03,856
I'm sure you understand.

287
00:13:03,939 --> 00:13:06,418
Our company contributes 1.5 million yuan

288
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:08,095
to Jiangzhou University
of Chinese Medicine every year

289
00:13:08,178 --> 00:13:09,655
for scholarship purposes.

290
00:13:09,738 --> 00:13:10,694
I know that.

291
00:13:10,777 --> 00:13:11,895
Correspondingly,

292
00:13:11,978 --> 00:13:13,694
Mr Ren will spend half a month

293
00:13:13,777 --> 00:13:14,934
during the summer and winter break

294
00:13:15,017 --> 00:13:18,017
to come to my company and provide us
with free seminars and diagnoses.

295
00:13:18,137 --> 00:13:19,134
-Mr Zheng.
-Therefore...

296
00:13:19,217 --> 00:13:20,934
If you're worried about the seminars,

297
00:13:21,017 --> 00:13:22,061
you won't need to worry.

298
00:13:22,457 --> 00:13:25,337
Mr Ren and I were peers for 30 years.

299
00:13:25,577 --> 00:13:26,455
I dare to promise you

300
00:13:26,538 --> 00:13:28,054
that I can deliver the same seminars
he can deliver.

301
00:13:28,137 --> 00:13:30,175
Regarding the seminars
and free diagnoses,

302
00:13:30,258 --> 00:13:31,934
you can just look for me.

303
00:13:32,017 --> 00:13:34,657
Our academy will support your company

304
00:13:34,858 --> 00:13:35,902
with everything we have.

305
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:41,343
Professor Wu, of course
I have confidence in your standards.

306
00:13:42,097 --> 00:13:43,095
However, Mr Ren

307
00:13:43,178 --> 00:13:45,178
is our chief advisor.

308
00:13:45,298 --> 00:13:46,374
He helped me out a lot

309
00:13:46,457 --> 00:13:47,777
when I first started out.

310
00:13:47,938 --> 00:13:49,895
It would be inappropriate of me
to stop donating to the academy

311
00:13:49,978 --> 00:13:50,735
just because he left the academy.

312
00:13:50,818 --> 00:13:51,818
Don't you think so?

313
00:13:53,217 --> 00:13:54,457
Look at that senior of mine.

314
00:13:55,217 --> 00:13:57,391
People use public possessions
for private purposes.

315
00:13:57,498 --> 00:14:00,017
But he's doing the opposite.

316
00:14:01,777 --> 00:14:03,014
I'm sure you all are tired

317
00:14:03,097 --> 00:14:04,337
after a long day of class.

318
00:14:06,097 --> 00:14:06,934
What about this?

319
00:14:07,017 --> 00:14:08,017
Let's play a game

320
00:14:08,777 --> 00:14:10,418
at the end of the period.

321
00:14:12,537 --> 00:14:13,375
I want to play games!

322
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:14,694
I'm in!

323
00:14:14,777 --> 00:14:15,777
Okay.

324
00:14:16,017 --> 00:14:16,935
So, what game will we play today?

325
00:14:17,018 --> 00:14:18,938
We'll play "Guess The Riddle".

326
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,923
(Guess The Riddle)

327
00:14:23,777 --> 00:14:26,137
With Yin and Yang, it makes two.

328
00:14:28,337 --> 00:14:30,207
That which ensues
as the result is goodness.

329
00:14:30,738 --> 00:14:33,337
That which shows it in its completeness
is the natures.

330
00:14:33,537 --> 00:14:36,097
The benevolent see it
and call it benevolence.

331
00:14:37,217 --> 00:14:40,258
The people use it every day,
yet they have no idea.

332
00:14:40,418 --> 00:14:41,418
Oh no.

333
00:14:41,577 --> 00:14:43,855
I don't get it.

334
00:14:43,938 --> 00:14:44,775
Me too.

335
00:14:44,858 --> 00:14:45,858
Yeah.

336
00:14:45,978 --> 00:14:47,017
Is it an object?

337
00:14:47,897 --> 00:14:48,897
That's right.

338
00:14:49,457 --> 00:14:50,655
How did you know it was an object?

339
00:14:50,738 --> 00:14:51,738
Roubecca.

340
00:14:51,978 --> 00:14:53,374
Do you hang it on the wall?

341
00:14:53,457 --> 00:14:54,814
Is it a type of food?

342
00:14:54,897 --> 00:14:56,537
It's a daily necessity.

343
00:14:58,097 --> 00:14:59,457
Daily necessity?

344
00:14:59,777 --> 00:15:00,814
I got it!

345
00:15:00,897 --> 00:15:01,775
Tell us.

346
00:15:01,858 --> 00:15:03,014
Body shampoo, shampoo,

347
00:15:03,097 --> 00:15:04,494
toothpaste, a feet board, pots and tools.

348
00:15:04,577 --> 00:15:05,938
One of them will be right.

349
00:15:07,897 --> 00:15:08,897
Thank you.

350
00:15:09,978 --> 00:15:10,978
Wrong answer.

351
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:12,938
All of them are wrong.

352
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:14,375
Everyone, listen.

353
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:17,657
With Yin and Yang, it makes two.

354
00:15:19,657 --> 00:15:20,657
Think about it.

355
00:15:20,938 --> 00:15:21,938
Think about it.

356
00:15:23,337 --> 00:15:24,337
It's chopsticks.

357
00:15:25,657 --> 00:15:26,657
That's right.

358
00:15:27,537 --> 00:15:28,624
The answer is chopsticks.

359
00:15:29,097 --> 00:15:31,535
Tell them why.

360
00:15:31,618 --> 00:15:34,271
With Yin and Yang, it makes two.
That means it comes in pairs.

361
00:15:34,858 --> 00:15:36,380
Gloves come in pairs too, you know?

362
00:15:37,258 --> 00:15:38,693
Do you wear gloves during summer?

363
00:15:39,258 --> 00:15:41,374
The people use it every day,
yet they have no idea.

364
00:15:41,457 --> 00:15:43,295
Since they use it every day,
that shows the frequency.

365
00:15:43,378 --> 00:15:45,614
They don't know because
they are already used to using them.

366
00:15:45,697 --> 00:15:47,175
I read this article

367
00:15:47,258 --> 00:15:48,374
when I was in high school.

368
00:15:48,457 --> 00:15:49,814
It talked about chopsticks.

369
00:15:49,897 --> 00:15:52,574
Chopsticks are the culmination
of Chinese culture.

370
00:15:52,657 --> 00:15:54,378
That's right.

371
00:15:55,097 --> 00:15:56,184
The answer is chopsticks.

372
00:15:56,978 --> 00:15:58,415
Who can tell me

373
00:15:58,498 --> 00:15:59,498
which side

374
00:16:00,618 --> 00:16:02,818
is Yang and which side is Yin?

375
00:16:06,217 --> 00:16:08,258
The top is Yang

376
00:16:09,217 --> 00:16:11,017
while the bottom is Yin.

377
00:16:12,017 --> 00:16:13,757
The hand will be in the middle position.

378
00:16:14,657 --> 00:16:16,574
That's why I wanted you all
to maintain neutrality.

379
00:16:16,657 --> 00:16:17,735
If you hold your chopsticks well,

380
00:16:17,818 --> 00:16:20,378
you can pick up any food.

381
00:16:25,378 --> 00:16:27,335
So, as to why I talked about
chopsticks today,

382
00:16:27,418 --> 00:16:29,574
it's related to the main topic
of our next class.

383
00:16:29,657 --> 00:16:32,178
So, why do we call TCM practitioners
"Zhong Yi"?

384
00:16:33,378 --> 00:16:34,987
Does the word "Zhong" mean "central"?

385
00:16:35,738 --> 00:16:36,825
Or does it mean "middle"?

386
00:16:38,978 --> 00:16:40,498
Stay tuned to the next class.

387
00:16:42,498 --> 00:16:43,498
By the way,

388
00:16:43,777 --> 00:16:45,337
the Qingming Festival is nearing.

389
00:16:46,097 --> 00:16:48,017
You guys have to prepare some offerings.

390
00:16:48,858 --> 00:16:50,535
Ms Song will teach you guys
how to make them.

391
00:16:50,618 --> 00:16:51,618
Since you won

392
00:16:51,978 --> 00:16:53,254
the riddle game today,

393
00:16:53,337 --> 00:16:55,295
you can do your own things tonight.

394
00:16:55,378 --> 00:16:56,378
Alright, guys.

395
00:16:56,978 --> 00:16:57,978
Class dismissed.

396
00:17:03,618 --> 00:17:06,258
Mr Ren does impress me to no end.

397
00:17:06,378 --> 00:17:07,858
He kept telling me

398
00:17:08,018 --> 00:17:09,734
that we just need to hold a firm belief.

399
00:17:09,817 --> 00:17:11,337
If so, money will come to us

400
00:17:11,457 --> 00:17:12,898
when we need it the most.

401
00:17:13,138 --> 00:17:16,097
Lo and behold,
our God of Wealth has arrived.

402
00:17:17,498 --> 00:17:19,055
We require a substantial amount of fund

403
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:20,775
to maintain the apprentice class.

404
00:17:20,858 --> 00:17:22,254
Your two million yuan

405
00:17:22,337 --> 00:17:23,858
is godsend.

406
00:17:24,258 --> 00:17:25,258
We support each other.

407
00:17:26,018 --> 00:17:27,415
Naturally, Professor Ren
requires our help

408
00:17:27,498 --> 00:17:28,658
to spread his wisdom.

409
00:17:28,858 --> 00:17:29,656
Professor Ren

410
00:17:29,739 --> 00:17:31,175
deserves our help too.

411
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:32,655
It was tough for me
to start my business back then.

412
00:17:32,738 --> 00:17:34,337
I had no directions at all.

413
00:17:34,457 --> 00:17:37,055
Professor Ren was the one
who taught me how to plant wormwood

414
00:17:37,138 --> 00:17:39,014
and wolfsbane.

415
00:17:39,097 --> 00:17:40,738
After I made my first pot of gold,

416
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:43,837
Professor Ren was the one who helped me
to develop patented Chinese medicine.

417
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,815
To sum it up,

418
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:46,778
my money is Professor Ren's.

419
00:17:47,618 --> 00:17:48,575
He just needs to tell me

420
00:17:48,658 --> 00:17:49,978
whenever he needs help.

421
00:17:52,378 --> 00:17:53,738
It's getting late.

422
00:17:55,258 --> 00:17:56,175
We'll make a move first.

423
00:17:56,258 --> 00:17:57,650
We'll stop interrupting you all.

424
00:17:58,258 --> 00:17:59,778
You came all the way here,

425
00:18:00,378 --> 00:18:02,138
yet you're leaving without seeing him?

426
00:18:02,858 --> 00:18:04,494
I think Senior will return soon.

427
00:18:04,577 --> 00:18:05,655
Have some tea.

428
00:18:05,738 --> 00:18:07,018
Here, have some tea.

429
00:18:10,097 --> 00:18:11,015
My dear bosses,

430
00:18:11,098 --> 00:18:13,457
what are you two doing here today?

431
00:18:16,337 --> 00:18:17,695
-Have a seat.
-Xin Cheng

432
00:18:17,778 --> 00:18:19,240
is here to deliver money to us.

433
00:18:19,738 --> 00:18:21,494
He transferred the scholarship
meant for the academy

434
00:18:21,577 --> 00:18:23,175
to our class.

435
00:18:23,258 --> 00:18:24,535
The academy doesn't need any money,

436
00:18:24,618 --> 00:18:26,217
but we need the money urgently.

437
00:18:30,258 --> 00:18:32,258
I cannot take the scholarship money.

438
00:18:32,618 --> 00:18:33,815
Why not?

439
00:18:33,898 --> 00:18:34,735
Look.

440
00:18:34,818 --> 00:18:36,858
The scholarship belongs to the academy.

441
00:18:37,138 --> 00:18:38,738
And I've already resigned.

442
00:18:39,778 --> 00:18:41,134
I can't just take the money with me

443
00:18:41,217 --> 00:18:42,858
after I've resigned from my post.

444
00:18:43,233 --> 00:18:44,233
Don't you think so?

445
00:18:44,658 --> 00:18:47,295
I know you're here to repay the favour.

446
00:18:47,378 --> 00:18:48,254
Actually, I just did

447
00:18:48,337 --> 00:18:51,134
what I was supposed to do
when I was still working in the academy.

448
00:18:51,217 --> 00:18:53,055
I need to thank the academy

449
00:18:53,138 --> 00:18:54,775
for helping me, supporting me,

450
00:18:54,858 --> 00:18:56,695
and providing me with
this many platforms.

451
00:18:56,778 --> 00:18:58,039
That's why I think you should

452
00:18:58,898 --> 00:19:00,175
keep the scholarship money
for the school.

453
00:19:00,258 --> 00:19:01,135
But

454
00:19:01,218 --> 00:19:03,457
the conditions here aren't too good.

455
00:19:03,978 --> 00:19:05,498
Your wife already told me

456
00:19:05,858 --> 00:19:06,935
that you guys were in
straitened circumstances.

457
00:19:07,018 --> 00:19:08,018
What about this?

458
00:19:08,538 --> 00:19:10,295
I'll reserve 1.5 million yuan
for the academy.

459
00:19:10,378 --> 00:19:13,118
You can have the rest, which is
500,000 yuan. What do you think?

460
00:19:16,258 --> 00:19:18,575
Helping poor students
to complete their study

461
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:20,535
is a huge deal.

462
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:21,695
You don't need

463
00:19:21,778 --> 00:19:23,134
to worry about me.

464
00:19:23,217 --> 00:19:24,217
That's right.

465
00:19:24,498 --> 00:19:26,738
Mr Ren is right.
We don't need any money.

466
00:19:30,618 --> 00:19:31,895
What about the seminars then?

467
00:19:31,978 --> 00:19:33,415
Mr Ren, my employees and clients

468
00:19:33,498 --> 00:19:34,775
are looking forward to your classes.

469
00:19:34,858 --> 00:19:36,895
I can guarantee this.

470
00:19:36,978 --> 00:19:37,978
Shan Dao

471
00:19:38,778 --> 00:19:40,055
is one of the best in our field

472
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:42,138
when it comes to giving diagnoses
and seminars.

473
00:19:42,618 --> 00:19:44,815
I'm sure he can deliver
the seminars without any issues.

474
00:19:44,898 --> 00:19:45,898
That's right.

475
00:19:46,138 --> 00:19:47,056
Mr Ren,

476
00:19:47,139 --> 00:19:48,738
I definitely believe in your words.

477
00:19:49,738 --> 00:19:51,895
Mr Wu, I don't intend to be offensive.

478
00:19:51,978 --> 00:19:53,134
The entire Jiangzhou

479
00:19:53,217 --> 00:19:54,738
knows how good you are.

480
00:19:55,498 --> 00:19:56,255
However, Professor Ren,

481
00:19:56,338 --> 00:19:58,655
the foreign clients we're dealing with

482
00:19:58,738 --> 00:20:00,055
are investing in us because of you.

483
00:20:00,138 --> 00:20:01,258
But now, you've resigned.

484
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:03,227
I'll definitely deliver the seminars.

485
00:20:03,337 --> 00:20:04,295
Although I've resigned,

486
00:20:04,378 --> 00:20:06,374
I still care about the academy.

487
00:20:06,457 --> 00:20:07,176
Don't worry about it.

488
00:20:07,259 --> 00:20:08,695
But I have one condition.

489
00:20:08,778 --> 00:20:09,778
Shan Dao,

490
00:20:10,018 --> 00:20:11,538
see if this will work.

491
00:20:12,138 --> 00:20:13,056
Both of us can deliver

492
00:20:13,139 --> 00:20:14,417
the seminars in turn.

493
00:20:15,858 --> 00:20:17,378
-What do you think?
-No problem.

494
00:20:18,658 --> 00:20:19,937
You're lucky that you're able

495
00:20:20,097 --> 00:20:22,054
to get Shan Dao to deliver seminars,
you know?

496
00:20:32,018 --> 00:20:33,214
What time is it?

497
00:20:33,297 --> 00:20:35,134
Why isn't Tou Tou
calling us for dinner yet?

498
00:20:35,217 --> 00:20:36,655
I told the students

499
00:20:36,738 --> 00:20:39,258
that you're skipping dinner tonight.

500
00:20:40,538 --> 00:20:41,974
I taught them the entire day, you know?

501
00:20:42,057 --> 00:20:43,217
Now, I can't even eat?

502
00:20:43,778 --> 00:20:44,778
We're penniless.

503
00:20:48,378 --> 00:20:49,854
Wu Shan Dao is the worst.

504
00:20:49,937 --> 00:20:51,658
Did Shan Dao offend you somehow?

505
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:54,374
You can never accept

506
00:20:54,457 --> 00:20:55,296
Zheng Xin Cheng's money

507
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:56,937
under his supervision.

508
00:20:58,217 --> 00:21:00,618
If you do, he'll spread rumours
about you.

509
00:21:01,138 --> 00:21:03,055
He'll say that Ren Xin Zheng
burns his bridges

510
00:21:03,138 --> 00:21:04,457
after crossing them.

511
00:21:05,337 --> 00:21:06,618
Nonsense.

512
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:09,575
Even if Shan Dao wasn't there,

513
00:21:09,658 --> 00:21:11,050
I wouldn't accept the money too.

514
00:21:11,258 --> 00:21:12,258
Yeah, yeah.

515
00:21:12,457 --> 00:21:13,738
You're the good guy here.

516
00:21:14,378 --> 00:21:16,596
I have to endure all these hardships
because of you.

517
00:21:23,337 --> 00:21:26,138
We haven't run out of food yet, right?

518
00:21:35,018 --> 00:21:36,295
If you're that capable,

519
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:37,944
you shouldn't use my parents' money.

520
00:21:39,258 --> 00:21:40,374
If you're that capable,

521
00:21:40,457 --> 00:21:42,153
don't spend the medical centre's money.

522
00:21:48,378 --> 00:21:49,815
It's all because I love Master.

523
00:21:49,898 --> 00:21:51,734
I wouldn't have married you

524
00:21:51,817 --> 00:21:53,175
if I didn't love Master.

525
00:21:53,258 --> 00:21:54,738
Master is a generous person.

526
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:58,457
You don't take after him at all.

527
00:22:04,978 --> 00:22:05,978
Do you need anything?

528
00:22:08,378 --> 00:22:10,175
Madam, I just wish to ask you

529
00:22:10,258 --> 00:22:12,867
if you're still teaching us
how to fold paper ingots tonight?

530
00:22:18,538 --> 00:22:19,295
Of course.

531
00:22:19,378 --> 00:22:21,161
You guys can prepare the materials first.

532
00:22:21,378 --> 00:22:22,639
If so, I'll head there first.

533
00:22:50,778 --> 00:22:51,778
Don't lick it.

534
00:22:52,138 --> 00:22:54,052
Tin is a type of heavy metal.
It's poisonous.

535
00:22:55,498 --> 00:22:56,895
You could've told me earlier!

536
00:22:56,978 --> 00:22:58,498
I think I'm poisoned by now.

537
00:23:02,498 --> 00:23:03,416
Niece-in-law,

538
00:23:03,499 --> 00:23:04,673
I searched for this online.

539
00:23:05,018 --> 00:23:07,858
They sell 1,000 of this
for 30 yuan online.

540
00:23:08,258 --> 00:23:10,177
Aren't we wasting our time and energy

541
00:23:10,477 --> 00:23:11,651
if we fold them one by one?

542
00:23:11,778 --> 00:23:14,097
Tou, will you fork out the 30 yuan then?

543
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:16,175
Of course not.

544
00:23:16,258 --> 00:23:17,175
I'm penniless.

545
00:23:17,258 --> 00:23:18,258
Tou Tou,

546
00:23:18,378 --> 00:23:19,770
this is a token of appreciation.

547
00:23:20,138 --> 00:23:22,895
It's a way we show our respect
to our predecessors.

548
00:23:22,978 --> 00:23:25,175
Now, we live in a modern era.

549
00:23:25,258 --> 00:23:27,014
If you want to contact someone,

550
00:23:27,097 --> 00:23:29,535
not only can you listen to their voice,

551
00:23:29,618 --> 00:23:31,018
but you can also

552
00:23:31,738 --> 00:23:33,254
see them on the screen
through a video call.

553
00:23:33,337 --> 00:23:34,535
It's different from the past.

554
00:23:34,618 --> 00:23:37,175
In the past, it took one year
to deliver a letter.

555
00:23:37,258 --> 00:23:39,138
Now, our lifestyle has changed.

556
00:23:40,138 --> 00:23:42,295
However, some things will never change.

557
00:23:42,378 --> 00:23:44,618
Just like what Mr Ren had taught today.

558
00:23:45,217 --> 00:23:47,575
If there is constant movement,

559
00:23:47,658 --> 00:23:49,175
there is non-movement too.

560
00:23:49,258 --> 00:23:50,295
If you understand the way of the world,

561
00:23:50,378 --> 00:23:52,695
you'll understand the concept
of Yin and Yang naturally.

562
00:23:52,778 --> 00:23:54,214
What are the things
that won't change then?

563
00:23:54,297 --> 00:23:56,295
I used to think that
I would never get a raise.

564
00:23:56,378 --> 00:23:58,177
Now, I got my raise.

565
00:23:59,498 --> 00:24:02,107
The only things that won't change
are the feelings of humans.

566
00:24:03,097 --> 00:24:04,535
A few thousand years ago,

567
00:24:04,618 --> 00:24:06,014
if one's parent passed away,

568
00:24:06,097 --> 00:24:07,535
they would cry.

569
00:24:07,618 --> 00:24:09,217
Even after several thousand years,

570
00:24:09,858 --> 00:24:10,858
it's still the same.

571
00:24:14,378 --> 00:24:15,378
Roubecca,

572
00:24:15,858 --> 00:24:17,134
what is that?

573
00:24:17,217 --> 00:24:18,535
It looks like a cake.

574
00:24:18,618 --> 00:24:20,175
That's a Lotus Pagoda.

575
00:24:20,258 --> 00:24:21,520
Lotus Pagoda?

576
00:24:21,978 --> 00:24:24,455
I thought you never participated
in any group activities?

577
00:24:24,538 --> 00:24:26,695
And, my nephew said you could
have the night off too.

578
00:24:26,778 --> 00:24:27,920
Why are you still here?

579
00:24:28,457 --> 00:24:29,762
I'm here to show my sincerity.

580
00:24:30,858 --> 00:24:32,293
This is my token of appreciation.

581
00:24:35,138 --> 00:24:36,056
Ms Song,

582
00:24:36,139 --> 00:24:40,055
I wish to take a day off
during Qingming Festival.

583
00:24:40,138 --> 00:24:41,254
That won't do.

584
00:24:41,337 --> 00:24:43,538
This is the first time
the apprentice class

585
00:24:44,258 --> 00:24:46,175
will be sweeping the graves
of our predecessors.

586
00:24:46,258 --> 00:24:49,055
I hope everyone can attend it.

587
00:24:49,138 --> 00:24:50,138
Is that okay?

588
00:24:52,378 --> 00:24:53,378
Actually,

589
00:24:54,138 --> 00:24:56,258
I just want to sweep my mother's grave.

590
00:25:04,498 --> 00:25:05,498
Okay.

591
00:25:06,618 --> 00:25:07,937
I'll tell Mr Ren

592
00:25:08,498 --> 00:25:10,775
to give you some time off
after sweeping our predecessors' graves.

593
00:25:10,858 --> 00:25:11,989
You're smart and talented.

594
00:25:12,258 --> 00:25:14,378
Skipping one class
won't affect your study.

595
00:25:15,858 --> 00:25:17,177
Thank you, Ms Song.

596
00:25:24,378 --> 00:25:25,658
What do you mean by that?

597
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:27,935
Is Roubecca the only smart one here?

598
00:25:28,018 --> 00:25:28,896
Am I not smart?

599
00:25:28,979 --> 00:25:30,575
Do you mean that I cannot afford
to skip any classes?

600
00:25:30,658 --> 00:25:31,789
That's not what she meant.

601
00:25:32,778 --> 00:25:34,254
Ms Song was saying

602
00:25:34,337 --> 00:25:35,655
that you skipping classes or not

603
00:25:35,738 --> 00:25:37,778
won't affect you either way.

604
00:25:40,018 --> 00:25:41,738
Won't affect me either way?

605
00:25:43,258 --> 00:25:45,655
Peng Shi Yan, I thought
you were complimenting me!

606
00:25:45,738 --> 00:25:46,935
Now that I think about it...

607
00:25:47,018 --> 00:25:48,018
Tou Tou.

608
00:25:49,778 --> 00:25:50,656
Sit here.

609
00:25:50,739 --> 00:25:52,097
Fold one and show it to me.

610
00:25:58,738 --> 00:25:59,738
I licked it again.

611
00:26:00,618 --> 00:26:01,974
If I lick it again,

612
00:26:02,057 --> 00:26:03,978
you guys have to clean my grave
next year.

613
00:26:05,378 --> 00:26:06,858
Give it a few more licks then.

614
00:26:08,538 --> 00:26:09,538
Tian Zhen.

615
00:26:12,858 --> 00:26:13,858
Tian Zhen.

616
00:26:28,618 --> 00:26:29,618
Get up.

617
00:26:41,337 --> 00:26:42,337
Wing Chun.

618
00:26:42,498 --> 00:26:43,498
Ip Man.

619
00:26:45,498 --> 00:26:46,658
Okay. Push me.

620
00:26:54,978 --> 00:26:56,258
Be gentle.

621
00:27:03,618 --> 00:27:04,619
Tou Tou,

622
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:10,374
Your legs are long, slender and toned.

623
00:27:10,457 --> 00:27:12,898
I'm completely under your spell.

624
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:14,498
Is that so?

625
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:16,695
Do my legs look that nice?

626
00:27:16,778 --> 00:27:19,213
Are they so nice that you have to kneel
and submit to me?

627
00:27:20,498 --> 00:27:24,018
But your face...

628
00:27:28,337 --> 00:27:29,468
What's wrong with my face?

629
00:27:31,538 --> 00:27:32,538
What?

630
00:27:35,097 --> 00:27:37,280
Your face...

631
00:27:37,858 --> 00:27:38,989
What's wrong with my face?

632
00:27:39,233 --> 00:27:40,233
Don't move.

633
00:27:49,577 --> 00:27:51,080
She does look like a man, huh?

634
00:27:52,138 --> 00:27:53,138
Ren Tian Zhen!

635
00:27:53,658 --> 00:27:54,702
Have you lost your mind?

636
00:27:58,144 --> 00:28:00,492
-What are you doing?
-Tian Zhen, you're something else.

637
00:28:01,057 --> 00:28:02,057
Sun Tou Tou.

638
00:28:10,778 --> 00:28:12,417
You guys are energetic indeed.

639
00:28:13,097 --> 00:28:14,177
What about this?

640
00:28:14,378 --> 00:28:17,217
You two can maintain this posture.

641
00:28:17,498 --> 00:28:19,018
Maintain it for an hour.

642
00:28:20,018 --> 00:28:21,018
This is unfair.

643
00:28:22,018 --> 00:28:24,214
I'm bending my waist while he's sitting.

644
00:28:24,297 --> 00:28:26,498
I'll definitely be more tired than him.

645
00:28:26,898 --> 00:28:27,815
Tian Zhen,

646
00:28:27,898 --> 00:28:28,898
let go of her first.

647
00:28:31,378 --> 00:28:33,552
You two, do your horse stance
in front of the wall.

648
00:28:33,697 --> 00:28:35,658
You're biased toward your son.

649
00:28:35,858 --> 00:28:36,892
Lift your leg.

650
00:28:38,498 --> 00:28:39,498
Get up.

651
00:28:48,258 --> 00:28:49,658
I know my son well.

652
00:28:50,538 --> 00:28:52,055
He would never do anything to you

653
00:28:52,138 --> 00:28:53,530
if you didn't provoke him first.

654
00:28:54,018 --> 00:28:55,655
He learned Wushu from

655
00:28:55,738 --> 00:28:56,935
a national champion at a young age.

656
00:28:57,018 --> 00:28:58,455
Do you think you can defeat him?

657
00:28:58,538 --> 00:28:59,974
Your bones would've been broken

658
00:29:00,057 --> 00:29:01,275
if he wanted to beat you up.

659
00:29:02,738 --> 00:29:04,217
Your son was the one

660
00:29:04,417 --> 00:29:07,138
who said I looked like a man.

661
00:29:12,138 --> 00:29:13,614
Is everyone happy with the outfit?

662
00:29:13,697 --> 00:29:14,416
Yes.

663
00:29:14,499 --> 00:29:16,018
-Yeah.
-No.

664
00:29:17,498 --> 00:29:18,618
Why not?

665
00:29:21,138 --> 00:29:24,538
I don't want to wear dresses.

666
00:29:24,778 --> 00:29:26,498
I think the design is wrong.

667
00:29:26,618 --> 00:29:28,538
I wish to wear trousers like them.

668
00:29:29,337 --> 00:29:30,337
But why?

669
00:29:32,018 --> 00:29:33,258
I don't like this costume.

670
00:29:35,258 --> 00:29:38,614
Formal dresses like these
are more restrictive

671
00:29:38,697 --> 00:29:39,858
than the usual clothing.

672
00:29:40,898 --> 00:29:44,217
However, we have to wear them during

673
00:29:44,858 --> 00:29:46,250
festive and important occasions.

674
00:29:47,217 --> 00:29:48,378
That's called courtesy.

675
00:29:49,138 --> 00:29:50,535
You feel uncomfortable wearing it

676
00:29:50,618 --> 00:29:52,271
because you don't conform to courtesy.

677
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:55,134
Do you think you'll find another girl

678
00:29:55,217 --> 00:29:57,044
jumping around like a monkey
just like you?

679
00:29:59,018 --> 00:30:01,134
If you sit and stand properly,

680
00:30:01,217 --> 00:30:02,815
you won't feel uncomfortable.

681
00:30:02,898 --> 00:30:04,415
Why don't you tie me up then?

682
00:30:04,498 --> 00:30:05,858
I won't jump around by then.

683
00:30:07,498 --> 00:30:08,815
Ms Song, I have a climbing rope.

684
00:30:08,898 --> 00:30:10,175
-Telling Tou Tou to wear a dress
-It's sturdy.

685
00:30:10,258 --> 00:30:12,258
-Is pretty difficult for her.
-Can you shut up?

686
00:30:13,898 --> 00:30:16,551
Class Leader, you do live up
to your name as our class leader.

687
00:30:16,978 --> 00:30:18,535
Why don't we leave her here
during Qingming Festival?

688
00:30:18,618 --> 00:30:19,879
You should stay here instead!

689
00:30:20,337 --> 00:30:21,295
Listen.

690
00:30:21,378 --> 00:30:22,895
I'll definitely sweep the graves.

691
00:30:22,978 --> 00:30:24,455
I'll do it even if it means
I have to wear dresses

692
00:30:24,538 --> 00:30:26,018
or walk on stilts.

693
00:30:27,018 --> 00:30:28,018
Tou Tou,

694
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:30,271
isn't it cold when you're bare-legged?

695
00:30:32,138 --> 00:30:32,855
Nope.

696
00:30:32,938 --> 00:30:34,721
All of you are bare-legged
as well, right?

697
00:30:35,498 --> 00:30:36,775
We're wearing

698
00:30:36,858 --> 00:30:38,498
leggings.

699
00:30:40,738 --> 00:30:41,895
What is that?

700
00:30:41,978 --> 00:30:42,978
Leggings?

701
00:30:47,018 --> 00:30:48,584
It looks like she's wearing nothing.

702
00:30:48,738 --> 00:30:50,734
This must be the
Eighth Wonder of the World.

703
00:30:50,817 --> 00:30:51,655
All of you are wearing it?

704
00:30:51,738 --> 00:30:52,738
Fine.

705
00:30:53,858 --> 00:30:54,858
I'll buy one for you.

706
00:30:56,738 --> 00:30:58,521
I knew my niece-in-law loves me the most.

707
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:02,378
If you guys are okay with your outfits,

708
00:31:03,018 --> 00:31:04,935
remember to wash it.

709
00:31:05,018 --> 00:31:06,778
We'll wear it during Qingming Festival.

710
00:31:07,378 --> 00:31:08,378
Okay.

711
00:31:08,618 --> 00:31:09,792
Alright, meeting dismissed.

712
00:31:18,217 --> 00:31:20,658
The dishes we need to offer
to our predecessors

713
00:31:20,898 --> 00:31:22,138
need to be made personally,

714
00:31:22,378 --> 00:31:23,378
including qingtuan.

715
00:31:23,858 --> 00:31:24,696
That's why you need to prepare

716
00:31:24,779 --> 00:31:26,953
the necessary ingredients
within the next few days.

717
00:31:28,738 --> 00:31:29,738
Wait.

718
00:31:30,738 --> 00:31:32,214
I wouldn't have celebrated the festival
with you guys

719
00:31:32,297 --> 00:31:34,080
had I known that it was this troublesome.

720
00:31:39,858 --> 00:31:41,014
Mum, this is too tight.

721
00:31:41,097 --> 00:31:41,896
It's choking me.

722
00:31:41,979 --> 00:31:43,138
What are you saying?

723
00:31:43,738 --> 00:31:45,378
Look. It's done now.

724
00:31:46,378 --> 00:31:47,415
You little fool.

725
00:31:47,498 --> 00:31:48,374
Alright. Get in the car.

726
00:31:48,457 --> 00:31:49,457
Alright.

727
00:31:49,738 --> 00:31:50,738
Morning, Ms Song.

728
00:31:51,097 --> 00:31:52,097
Morning.

729
00:31:54,378 --> 00:31:55,254
There are...

730
00:31:55,337 --> 00:31:56,535
We still have plenty of things to take!

731
00:31:56,618 --> 00:31:57,416
Slow down. Don't fall down.

732
00:31:57,499 --> 00:31:59,055
We still have plenty of things to bring!

733
00:31:59,138 --> 00:32:00,138
Tou Tou!

734
00:32:00,978 --> 00:32:03,065
Why don't you wear the leggings
I bought for you?

735
00:32:04,018 --> 00:32:05,455
It's too girlish.

736
00:32:05,538 --> 00:32:08,191
And, it's too tight. I don't want
to wear something like that.

737
00:32:08,978 --> 00:32:09,978
Slow down.

738
00:32:12,858 --> 00:32:14,014
Guys, as you can see,

739
00:32:14,097 --> 00:32:16,217
I can't keep that girl in check.

740
00:32:16,738 --> 00:32:18,130
Shan Dao, I'll leave her to you.

741
00:32:18,457 --> 00:32:19,895
I dare not say anything to her.

742
00:32:19,978 --> 00:32:21,538
She's my senior uncle after all.

743
00:32:22,217 --> 00:32:23,217
Calm down.

744
00:32:23,658 --> 00:32:24,658
Let's be patient.

745
00:32:25,018 --> 00:32:26,018
500 years.

746
00:32:26,217 --> 00:32:27,655
I'm sure we can transform her
within 500 years.

747
00:32:27,738 --> 00:32:28,738
500 years?

748
00:32:29,217 --> 00:32:30,898
I'll be a demon by then.

749
00:32:32,538 --> 00:32:33,935
Xuanzang turned a monkey

750
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:35,055
into a cultivator.

751
00:32:35,138 --> 00:32:37,254
Now, we're just trying to turn a tomboy

752
00:32:37,337 --> 00:32:39,097
into a girl.

753
00:32:39,778 --> 00:32:41,057
It's much simpler.

754
00:32:41,898 --> 00:32:43,734
Mr Ren,

755
00:32:43,817 --> 00:32:46,655
you were very strict with your student
in the past.

756
00:32:46,738 --> 00:32:48,738
All students tremble in fear
when they see you.

757
00:32:48,858 --> 00:32:50,258
But why are you so biased toward

758
00:32:51,186 --> 00:32:52,466
Tou Tou?

759
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,647
He doesn't uphold his principles
at all, does he?

760
00:32:55,097 --> 00:32:56,097
Mr Ren,

761
00:32:56,258 --> 00:32:57,295
I have the same question.

762
00:32:57,378 --> 00:32:58,378
Is that true?

763
00:32:58,858 --> 00:32:59,858
What do you think?

764
00:33:04,138 --> 00:33:06,055
-You caught the flu?
-Take the flu medicine now.

765
00:33:06,138 --> 00:33:08,182
Your pulse was pretty weak
when I read it today.

766
00:33:08,538 --> 00:33:09,374
I brought it with me.

767
00:33:09,457 --> 00:33:10,296
I'll take it in the car.

768
00:33:10,379 --> 00:33:12,018
I'm ready! Let's go!

769
00:33:18,018 --> 00:33:19,724
(Weather turns warmer, )

770
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,105
(and the plants sprout.)

771
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,202
(Clear scenery and weather, )

772
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,286
(all things are revitalized.)

773
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:36,271
(Qingming (Pure Brightness))

774
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,544
(Mount Huafeng)

775
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:47,057
Tian Zhen.

776
00:33:55,498 --> 00:33:56,498
Nephew.

777
00:33:57,097 --> 00:33:58,097
Nephew!

778
00:33:59,658 --> 00:34:00,658
Your wife...

779
00:34:01,297 --> 00:34:03,775
She tied a red knot behind every tree.

780
00:34:03,858 --> 00:34:06,134
What kind of ritual is that?

781
00:34:06,217 --> 00:34:07,815
Are you going to summon

782
00:34:07,898 --> 00:34:08,656
all the lost souls here?

783
00:34:08,739 --> 00:34:10,134
It feels inauspicious to me.

784
00:34:10,217 --> 00:34:11,657
Guys, listen up.

785
00:34:12,578 --> 00:34:15,738
There are many forked paths
in this mountain.

786
00:34:16,617 --> 00:34:18,175
When we're descending the mountain,

787
00:34:18,258 --> 00:34:19,455
if you get separated from the group,

788
00:34:19,538 --> 00:34:21,498
just follow the red knots down

789
00:34:22,137 --> 00:34:23,255
and you'll be fine.

790
00:34:23,338 --> 00:34:25,655
Please don't get separated.

791
00:34:25,738 --> 00:34:28,374
There are wolves, bears,

792
00:34:28,457 --> 00:34:29,657
and boars here.

793
00:34:30,137 --> 00:34:31,697
You guys must be careful.

794
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:34,034
-Alright.
-Are you trying to deceive a kid here?

795
00:34:34,137 --> 00:34:35,695
I'm sure this path is frequently used.

796
00:34:35,778 --> 00:34:37,495
How could there be wolves, bears,

797
00:34:37,578 --> 00:34:38,897
or wild beasts here?

798
00:34:39,818 --> 00:34:40,656
There weren't any in the past.

799
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:41,857
But now,

800
00:34:42,098 --> 00:34:43,538
it's been over two decades.

801
00:34:43,818 --> 00:34:45,334
The local youngsters

802
00:34:45,417 --> 00:34:46,935
had moved to the city
in search of better jobs.

803
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:49,895
Their parents are old now.

804
00:34:49,978 --> 00:34:51,457
Some of them have passed away too.

805
00:34:51,897 --> 00:34:53,695
Therefore, some of the houses here

806
00:34:53,778 --> 00:34:54,774
are abandoned.

807
00:34:54,857 --> 00:34:55,696
That's how this forest

808
00:34:55,779 --> 00:34:57,578
grew gradually.

809
00:34:58,217 --> 00:34:59,217
And that's why

810
00:34:59,657 --> 00:35:01,266
there are wild beasts lurking around.

811
00:35:01,377 --> 00:35:02,377
Come on, let's go.

812
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:14,578
Ling Ian.

813
00:35:15,137 --> 00:35:16,137
Coming.

814
00:35:22,298 --> 00:35:24,334
I thought animal dungs
were natural fertilizers?

815
00:35:24,417 --> 00:35:25,455
Why are you picking them up?

816
00:35:25,538 --> 00:35:26,578
This is a type of herb.

817
00:35:27,137 --> 00:35:28,137
A type of herb?

818
00:35:29,298 --> 00:35:30,735
Guys, look.

819
00:35:30,818 --> 00:35:32,935
Have you guys tried doing
any pharmacological experiments?

820
00:35:33,018 --> 00:35:34,015
When I was in college,

821
00:35:34,098 --> 00:35:36,018
I studied basic TCM theories.

822
00:35:36,177 --> 00:35:38,255
I know that bat dung
is good for the eyes.

823
00:35:38,338 --> 00:35:39,814
It's known as Faeces Vespertilionum.

824
00:35:39,897 --> 00:35:41,058
But I'm perplexed.

825
00:35:41,258 --> 00:35:42,735
Bats consume different food every day.

826
00:35:42,818 --> 00:35:43,774
They produce different dung every day.

827
00:35:43,857 --> 00:35:45,655
How could you guys know which bat dung

828
00:35:45,738 --> 00:35:46,857
could cure blindness?

829
00:35:47,457 --> 00:35:48,374
How do I put it?

830
00:35:48,457 --> 00:35:49,655
Don't you think it's too irresponsible

831
00:35:49,738 --> 00:35:50,574
for you guys to collect random dung

832
00:35:50,657 --> 00:35:51,818
for your patients?

833
00:35:52,538 --> 00:35:54,857
If so, the civet coffee you like so much,

834
00:35:55,498 --> 00:35:57,094
do you think they're the same

835
00:35:57,177 --> 00:35:58,177
if you test them?

836
00:35:58,818 --> 00:35:59,905
They're different, right?

837
00:36:00,417 --> 00:36:03,538
TCM practitioners aren't the only ones
utilizing animal dungs.

838
00:36:03,697 --> 00:36:05,895
You shouldn't belittle them.

839
00:36:05,978 --> 00:36:07,374
Everything exists

840
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:10,098
for its own reason.

841
00:36:11,217 --> 00:36:12,738
Some animal dungs

842
00:36:13,018 --> 00:36:14,538
are worth more than gold.

843
00:36:14,738 --> 00:36:16,134
You guys can search for it online.

844
00:36:16,217 --> 00:36:18,897
This dung costs around
8,000 to 10,000 yuan

845
00:36:19,937 --> 00:36:21,498
per gram.

846
00:36:22,177 --> 00:36:23,177
What kind of animal?

847
00:36:23,538 --> 00:36:25,784
What kind of animal is that valuable?

848
00:36:25,937 --> 00:36:27,198
Their dung is that expensive?

849
00:36:27,897 --> 00:36:29,655
Tell me what kind of animal it is.
I'll go and keep one.

850
00:36:29,738 --> 00:36:31,255
After that, I'll wait for it to poop.

851
00:36:31,338 --> 00:36:32,599
I'll sell its dung for money.

852
00:36:33,217 --> 00:36:36,897
It's called a sperm whale.

853
00:36:37,498 --> 00:36:39,455
A sperm whale

854
00:36:39,538 --> 00:36:42,695
is around 50 tons heavy.

855
00:36:42,778 --> 00:36:44,083
Do you think you can keep one?

856
00:36:45,818 --> 00:36:46,818
You can't, right?

857
00:36:47,417 --> 00:36:49,617
A sperm whale's dung is called

858
00:36:49,897 --> 00:36:52,498
ambergris.

859
00:36:53,177 --> 00:36:54,975
We use it to make incense,

860
00:36:55,058 --> 00:36:56,534
perfumes,

861
00:36:56,617 --> 00:36:57,416
and so on.

862
00:36:57,499 --> 00:36:58,975
It's an amazing material.

863
00:36:59,058 --> 00:37:01,137
So, you guys mustn't look down
on animal dungs.

864
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,495
In Compendium of Materia Medica,

865
00:37:02,578 --> 00:37:04,574
there are many kinds

866
00:37:04,657 --> 00:37:05,897
of animal dungs

867
00:37:06,377 --> 00:37:07,551
that have TCM applications.

868
00:37:08,217 --> 00:37:11,657
Let's take Wulingzhi as an example.

869
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:13,094
Even now, the field of TCM
is still using it.

870
00:37:13,177 --> 00:37:15,175
So, what's the similarity between

871
00:37:15,258 --> 00:37:16,345
TCM and Western medicine?

872
00:37:16,457 --> 00:37:19,457
Both fields hope that humans
can live healthily.

873
00:37:20,258 --> 00:37:21,258
If they're unhealthy,

874
00:37:22,018 --> 00:37:24,134
if we have to sustain their lives
with medicine and machines,

875
00:37:24,217 --> 00:37:25,614
that's not called longevity.

876
00:37:25,697 --> 00:37:27,058
That's

877
00:37:27,697 --> 00:37:29,258
torture.

878
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:32,298
Nephew, where's the animal then?

879
00:37:32,578 --> 00:37:33,374
Where can I find one?

880
00:37:33,457 --> 00:37:34,455
In the sea.

881
00:37:34,538 --> 00:37:35,538
Let's go.

882
00:37:36,538 --> 00:37:38,780
How much is that dung worth?

883
00:38:23,738 --> 00:38:25,655
Say, although we're in the wilderness,

884
00:38:25,738 --> 00:38:26,854
people do come here often.

885
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:29,655
Even the fruits here are fresh.

886
00:38:29,738 --> 00:38:30,738
Am I right, Nephew?

887
00:38:31,738 --> 00:38:32,937
Mr Huang Mei

888
00:38:33,498 --> 00:38:34,697
is a renowned figure.

889
00:38:35,457 --> 00:38:37,023
He's well-known throughout the land.

890
00:38:37,738 --> 00:38:39,695
Although he has passed away
for several decades,

891
00:38:39,778 --> 00:38:41,578
people still worship him.

892
00:38:44,018 --> 00:38:45,018
What?

893
00:38:45,338 --> 00:38:46,176
Come here.

894
00:38:46,259 --> 00:38:47,298
What are you doing?

895
00:38:47,498 --> 00:38:50,151
We'll worship our predecessors soon.
Your attire must be tidy.

896
00:38:50,258 --> 00:38:51,258
Come here.

897
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:55,335
My attire is tidy.

898
00:38:55,418 --> 00:38:57,417
I'm wearing extra pants.

899
00:38:59,457 --> 00:39:00,457
Button up.

900
00:39:05,818 --> 00:39:06,818
Tou Tou,

901
00:39:07,338 --> 00:39:08,978
observe closely.

902
00:39:10,018 --> 00:39:12,584
You're the successor of
the Jiang family's acupuncture sect.

903
00:39:13,018 --> 00:39:14,415
You'll be the one leading the sect

904
00:39:14,498 --> 00:39:17,217
and the younger generations to worship

905
00:39:17,538 --> 00:39:19,978
our predecessors in the future.

906
00:39:22,578 --> 00:39:23,534
Guys,

907
00:39:23,617 --> 00:39:25,455
since today is Qingming Festival...

908
00:39:25,538 --> 00:39:26,818
We'll take a day off then.

909
00:39:35,098 --> 00:39:37,377
Qingming Festival is one of
the 24 Solar Terms.

910
00:39:39,018 --> 00:39:40,215
According to
Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic,

911
00:39:40,298 --> 00:39:42,857
humans are connected to Heaven and Earth.

912
00:39:43,978 --> 00:39:45,065
If so, those who are sick

913
00:39:46,018 --> 00:39:48,255
are not in sync with Heaven and Earth.

914
00:39:48,338 --> 00:39:50,255
If so, what do we examine
if we're TCM practitioners?

915
00:39:50,338 --> 00:39:53,134
We examine the person who is sick,

916
00:39:53,217 --> 00:39:55,098
not the disease they have.

917
00:39:56,258 --> 00:39:58,738
We need to make people
in sync with Heaven and Earth.

918
00:39:58,937 --> 00:40:01,217
We need to let them know
the change of the seasons

919
00:40:01,498 --> 00:40:02,978
and where their hearts belong.

920
00:40:03,217 --> 00:40:05,391
That way, they won't deviate
from the central path.

921
00:40:05,498 --> 00:40:06,455
Second,

922
00:40:06,538 --> 00:40:09,897
Qingming Festival is an important time
for us to worship our predecessors.

923
00:40:10,018 --> 00:40:11,578
If so, I hope

924
00:40:12,417 --> 00:40:13,697
that everyone

925
00:40:14,018 --> 00:40:17,298
can worship our predecessors
with sincerity.

926
00:40:30,217 --> 00:40:31,457
Tou Tou, bow.

927
00:40:33,098 --> 00:40:34,175
I don't know them.

928
00:40:34,258 --> 00:40:35,294
And, they're not your relatives.

929
00:40:35,377 --> 00:40:36,377
I think

930
00:40:36,738 --> 00:40:38,818
this is ridiculous.

931
00:40:39,697 --> 00:40:41,098
This is so strange.

932
00:40:48,018 --> 00:40:49,778
Let us read

933
00:40:50,937 --> 00:40:52,854
Virtue of A Great Physician
in front of Mr Huang's grave

934
00:40:52,937 --> 00:40:54,217
to comfort our predecessors.

935
00:40:54,457 --> 00:40:56,975
May we have successors and
our initial goals be unchanged.

936
00:40:57,058 --> 00:40:58,334
Healing the wounded and
rescuing the dying

937
00:40:58,417 --> 00:40:59,657
are my ambitions.

938
00:41:00,657 --> 00:41:02,215
Virtue of A Great Physician.

939
00:41:02,298 --> 00:41:03,415
Even if you read it,

940
00:41:03,498 --> 00:41:04,818
do you think he can hear it?

941
00:41:05,818 --> 00:41:07,134
Even if we read together,

942
00:41:07,217 --> 00:41:09,457
can he hear us?

943
00:41:10,697 --> 00:41:11,697
He can't, right?

944
00:41:15,864 --> 00:41:17,237
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

945
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,357
(are referenced from relevant
traditional Chinese medicine books)

946
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,745
