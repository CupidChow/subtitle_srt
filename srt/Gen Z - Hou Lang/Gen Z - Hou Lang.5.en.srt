00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,330
(Gen Z)

2
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,706
(Episode 5)

3
00:01:38,858 --> 00:01:39,938
Did that girl die?

4
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:40,913
Nonsense.

5
00:01:40,938 --> 00:01:41,738
Stop jinxing it.

6
00:01:41,858 --> 00:01:42,660
We saved her.

7
00:01:42,818 --> 00:01:43,658
You had me for a second there.

8
00:01:43,658 --> 00:01:44,898
What's with the long face then?

9
00:01:45,217 --> 00:01:47,538
One of her Fallopian tubes was removed.

10
00:01:50,578 --> 00:01:52,937
How many Fallopian tubes
does a woman have?

11
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,160
Two.

12
00:01:54,178 --> 00:01:55,297
That means she has one left, right?

13
00:01:55,498 --> 00:01:56,386
That's fine, right?

14
00:01:58,537 --> 00:01:59,937
What illness does she have?

15
00:01:59,937 --> 00:02:00,777
My nephew and niece-in-law

16
00:02:00,777 --> 00:02:02,258
were quite nervous about it.

17
00:02:03,258 --> 00:02:04,258
It's eccyesis.

18
00:02:05,457 --> 00:02:06,457
Eccyesis?

19
00:02:07,257 --> 00:02:08,297
She's so young.

20
00:02:08,698 --> 00:02:09,614
But she...

21
00:02:09,698 --> 00:02:10,818
She had eccyesis...

22
00:02:10,818 --> 00:02:11,679
Tou Tou,

23
00:02:12,097 --> 00:02:13,109
when it comes to being laid back,

24
00:02:13,257 --> 00:02:14,218
no one can rival you.

25
00:02:26,338 --> 00:02:28,577
Why are you three so tensed up?

26
00:02:28,577 --> 00:02:30,257
It's not like you guys
made her pregnant.

27
00:02:30,978 --> 00:02:32,737
Every debt has its debtor, right?

28
00:02:32,897 --> 00:02:33,897
From an objective perspective,

29
00:02:34,178 --> 00:02:35,538
you guys did a good deed.

30
00:02:35,538 --> 00:02:37,058
It's a good deed, you know?

31
00:02:37,058 --> 00:02:37,858
You did something good.

32
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:43,297
Looks like you're discouraged.

33
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:45,738
If so, should we try to save them

34
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:47,338
if we get caught in the same situation?

35
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:49,458
I think Tian Zhen

36
00:02:49,817 --> 00:02:50,897
doesn't know what to do now.

37
00:02:54,418 --> 00:02:55,537
It's not that big of a deal.

38
00:02:57,058 --> 00:02:57,929
Tian Zhen,

39
00:02:58,338 --> 00:02:59,418
listen.

40
00:03:01,537 --> 00:03:03,338
I think, in life,

41
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:05,418
we deserve to be forgiven

42
00:03:05,897 --> 00:03:07,257
as long as we don't harm
someone on purpose.

43
00:03:10,073 --> 00:03:10,917
Just like me.

44
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:12,177
Even if I did break someone's bones,

45
00:03:12,177 --> 00:03:13,617
I stood up for what was right.

46
00:03:13,897 --> 00:03:15,978
You can't include that
in my dark history.

47
00:03:16,537 --> 00:03:17,418
We need to look at

48
00:03:17,537 --> 00:03:19,897
the bright side of life.

49
00:03:21,617 --> 00:03:22,501
Stop blaming yourself.

50
00:03:28,058 --> 00:03:29,978
If we encounter such a situation again,

51
00:03:29,978 --> 00:03:32,177
we should do what we need to do.

52
00:03:32,177 --> 00:03:34,058
Just like the song, we need to
brave the nine continents.

53
00:03:34,617 --> 00:03:35,537
Brave the nine continents.

54
00:03:36,338 --> 00:03:37,658
Brave the nine continents.

55
00:03:38,537 --> 00:03:39,338
-Brave...
-Tou Tou.

56
00:03:41,058 --> 00:03:42,257
You should stop studying TCM.

57
00:03:42,778 --> 00:03:44,257
I'm serious. You're a great cook.

58
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:45,858
You should cook for us instead.

59
00:03:48,897 --> 00:03:50,097
That's the reason

60
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:51,218
I came here.

61
00:03:52,338 --> 00:03:53,208
Take a look.

62
00:03:53,537 --> 00:03:54,338
What do you want to have tomorrow?

63
00:03:57,817 --> 00:04:00,138
There's nothing more important
than filling one's tummy.

64
00:04:00,489 --> 00:04:01,297
Wait, Tian Zhen.

65
00:04:01,338 --> 00:04:03,617
The two abalones you said yesterday,

66
00:04:03,617 --> 00:04:04,817
what are they?

67
00:04:04,897 --> 00:04:06,298
What are two abalones?

68
00:04:06,298 --> 00:04:07,698
Twin abalones.

69
00:04:08,418 --> 00:04:09,418
Twin abalones?

70
00:04:09,617 --> 00:04:10,978
Twin abalones?

71
00:04:12,058 --> 00:04:14,218
That means there are two heads
on the abalone, right?

72
00:04:15,609 --> 00:04:16,456
You...

73
00:04:16,537 --> 00:04:17,418
You're trying to deceive me, huh?

74
00:04:17,418 --> 00:04:18,657
You're deceiving me because
I never had abalone before.

75
00:04:18,978 --> 00:04:20,257
But I really never had them before.

76
00:04:20,938 --> 00:04:22,097
Where can I buy twin abalones?

77
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,040
(Alternative Medicine)

78
00:05:28,218 --> 00:05:29,088
Sun Tou Tou.

79
00:05:30,778 --> 00:05:31,653
Sun Tou Tou?

80
00:05:36,097 --> 00:05:37,097
Roubecca?

81
00:05:37,257 --> 00:05:39,657
You woke up earlier than a rooster.

82
00:05:41,338 --> 00:05:42,156
Hey,

83
00:05:42,498 --> 00:05:44,058
did you see my doll?

84
00:05:45,457 --> 00:05:46,377
Nope.

85
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:57,904
You!

86
00:05:58,217 --> 00:05:59,031
Wait.

87
00:05:59,497 --> 00:06:00,858
Just lend it to me.

88
00:06:01,217 --> 00:06:02,858
I was using it to study last night.

89
00:06:04,377 --> 00:06:05,252
Just lend it to me.

90
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:07,377
If you wish to study,

91
00:06:07,777 --> 00:06:09,138
you can buy your own doll.

92
00:06:09,657 --> 00:06:11,497
If you take someone's belonging

93
00:06:11,777 --> 00:06:13,217
without their permission,

94
00:06:13,497 --> 00:06:14,618
that means you're stealing from them.

95
00:06:16,618 --> 00:06:17,458
Wait.

96
00:06:17,698 --> 00:06:19,097
What do you mean by stealing?

97
00:06:19,497 --> 00:06:21,418
You're kicking up a huge fuss out of it.

98
00:06:21,418 --> 00:06:22,537
We're dormmates.

99
00:06:22,937 --> 00:06:24,537
You shouldn't just
keep your things to yourself.

100
00:06:25,217 --> 00:06:26,698
That's narrow-minded of you.

101
00:06:26,817 --> 00:06:27,898
You need to share your things.

102
00:06:27,937 --> 00:06:29,537
-I...
-Have you ever heard of a shared bike?

103
00:06:30,377 --> 00:06:32,018
Will you care about the next rider
after you ride the bike?

104
00:06:32,018 --> 00:06:32,862
You won't, right?

105
00:06:33,257 --> 00:06:34,817
You'll leave the bike there and leave.

106
00:06:35,057 --> 00:06:36,777
If you're truly upset about it,

107
00:06:37,937 --> 00:06:39,217
I'll return it to you. I don't need it.

108
00:06:41,937 --> 00:06:42,919
Roubecca.

109
00:06:43,097 --> 00:06:44,055
Roubecca.

110
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:46,497
What do you mean by this?

111
00:06:47,898 --> 00:06:49,217
Are you discarding it?

112
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:52,937
If so, I'll take it then.

113
00:06:55,178 --> 00:06:56,497
This way, I won't need
to buy another one.

114
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:06,337
I just wiped it.

115
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,438
Quan,

116
00:07:09,937 --> 00:07:10,805
thanks.

117
00:07:13,097 --> 00:07:13,919
Class Leader,

118
00:07:14,097 --> 00:07:15,257
I need to tell you something.

119
00:07:15,537 --> 00:07:17,057
Sun Tou Tou stole my belonging.

120
00:07:17,618 --> 00:07:18,657
What did she steal?

121
00:07:18,657 --> 00:07:19,657
I didn't steal it!

122
00:07:19,657 --> 00:07:20,698
I just took it.

123
00:07:21,337 --> 00:07:22,254
I took it.

124
00:07:22,898 --> 00:07:24,657
Taking other people's belonging
without permission

125
00:07:24,657 --> 00:07:26,217
is considered stealing.

126
00:07:27,898 --> 00:07:29,698
I guess you do have many belongings
that can be stolen.

127
00:07:30,337 --> 00:07:31,458
Your shirt alone costs
tens of thousands.

128
00:07:31,777 --> 00:07:33,418
Tell me. What did she steal from you?

129
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:36,363
This.

130
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:37,657
This is it?

131
00:07:37,777 --> 00:07:38,635
Yeah.

132
00:07:39,217 --> 00:07:40,298
I thought she stole something expensive.

133
00:07:40,657 --> 00:07:42,097
It's just a mannequin, right?

134
00:07:42,698 --> 00:07:43,618
Don't be so petty.

135
00:07:43,777 --> 00:07:44,777
You two should share it.

136
00:07:45,657 --> 00:07:46,537
That's what I thought too.

137
00:07:46,537 --> 00:07:47,497
We should share this.

138
00:07:49,057 --> 00:07:49,943
First,

139
00:07:50,337 --> 00:07:52,057
I don't like it when
people touch my stuff.

140
00:07:52,257 --> 00:07:53,128
Second,

141
00:07:53,898 --> 00:07:55,217
I don't like Sun Tou Tou either.

142
00:07:55,537 --> 00:07:57,217
I request a change of dorm.

143
00:07:57,777 --> 00:07:58,665
Sorry,

144
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:00,097
but we're out of rooms.

145
00:08:02,898 --> 00:08:03,777
If so, we need

146
00:08:03,777 --> 00:08:04,898
to establish a set of rules.

147
00:08:05,657 --> 00:08:06,537
From today onward,

148
00:08:06,937 --> 00:08:08,178
you cannot touch my things.

149
00:08:08,377 --> 00:08:09,257
All of it.

150
00:08:09,257 --> 00:08:10,057
Understood?

151
00:08:10,937 --> 00:08:12,097
Tou Tou, what do you think?

152
00:08:12,257 --> 00:08:13,458
I'm very generous.

153
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:15,497
Anyway, I'll allow her
to touch my things.

154
00:08:16,337 --> 00:08:17,377
And, I think...

155
00:08:18,497 --> 00:08:19,378
Lift your butt.

156
00:08:19,937 --> 00:08:21,738
We should at least be fair.

157
00:08:22,657 --> 00:08:23,458
Don't worry.

158
00:08:23,817 --> 00:08:25,337
I won't touch your stuff.

159
00:08:25,337 --> 00:08:26,377
So, please don't touch

160
00:08:26,377 --> 00:08:27,377
my stuff either.

161
00:08:27,978 --> 00:08:28,817
That's not right.

162
00:08:29,817 --> 00:08:31,377
It's a two-way relationship.

163
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:33,337
How could you make the call alone?

164
00:08:34,898 --> 00:08:37,018
I allow you to take my things.

165
00:08:37,018 --> 00:08:39,138
You should allow me
to take your things too.

166
00:08:39,138 --> 00:08:40,097
That should be the case,

167
00:08:40,777 --> 00:08:41,898
am I right?

168
00:08:41,898 --> 00:08:42,898
Don't you think so?

169
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:43,777
Morning, Mr Ren.

170
00:08:45,217 --> 00:08:46,041
Nephew.

171
00:08:46,537 --> 00:08:47,337
Mr Ren,

172
00:08:47,978 --> 00:08:48,777
I request permission

173
00:08:48,777 --> 00:08:50,978
to sleep in a different room
from Sun Tou Tou.

174
00:08:50,978 --> 00:08:52,978
What about this? I'll sleep
at home every night.

175
00:08:52,978 --> 00:08:55,377
I promise I won't be late for class.

176
00:08:55,898 --> 00:08:57,057
But why?

177
00:08:57,777 --> 00:08:58,658
I...

178
00:08:58,777 --> 00:08:59,658
Mr Ren,

179
00:09:00,777 --> 00:09:02,738
I want to sleep at home too.

180
00:09:06,097 --> 00:09:07,298
Does anyone else

181
00:09:07,898 --> 00:09:08,777
want to sleep at home too?

182
00:09:22,418 --> 00:09:23,537
Ms Yang.

183
00:09:27,337 --> 00:09:28,418
Tell me.

184
00:09:29,097 --> 00:09:30,217
Why do you think

185
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:32,537
we have to live together

186
00:09:32,537 --> 00:09:34,377
in the first three months
of the apprentice class?

187
00:09:34,377 --> 00:09:35,337
Have you ever thought of that?

188
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:41,018
-Has anyone ever thought of that?
-Me!

189
00:09:46,657 --> 00:09:47,526
Tell me.

190
00:10:01,418 --> 00:10:02,657
If you want to get your skills honed,

191
00:10:03,337 --> 00:10:04,377
you must never sleep at home.

192
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:08,217
What's so funny?

193
00:10:11,298 --> 00:10:13,097
Sun Tou Tou's crude words

194
00:10:15,298 --> 00:10:16,657
carry fine ideas.

195
00:10:23,017 --> 00:10:25,017
If we don't live together,

196
00:10:26,457 --> 00:10:28,178
the flaws you have

197
00:10:29,217 --> 00:10:31,217
are considered a deviation in TCM.

198
00:10:31,657 --> 00:10:33,178
That means you're not
maintaining your virtues.

199
00:10:33,978 --> 00:10:35,457
TCM is different from Western medicine.

200
00:10:35,657 --> 00:10:37,137
Western medicine uses machines
to give diagnoses.

201
00:10:37,738 --> 00:10:38,897
Once the data is out,

202
00:10:39,657 --> 00:10:42,017
the machines will know what's different
about your body.

203
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:42,858
It's different for TCM.

204
00:10:42,858 --> 00:10:43,858
We read pulses.

205
00:10:45,657 --> 00:10:47,897
The first thing you do
when you read pulses is to feel.

206
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:48,978
The word "Gan", or feel,

207
00:10:49,978 --> 00:10:51,298
is very advanced

208
00:10:52,457 --> 00:10:53,537
in the Chinese culture.

209
00:10:54,337 --> 00:10:55,137
In "Questions of Organic and
Fundamental Nature: The manifestation of

210
00:10:56,258 --> 00:10:58,457
Yin and Yang from
the macrocosm to the microcosm",

211
00:10:58,457 --> 00:10:59,657
there's this saying.

212
00:11:00,457 --> 00:11:01,777
With I as the measure,
I detect irregularity in others.

213
00:11:02,777 --> 00:11:04,178
Through observing the exterior,
I diagnose the interior.

214
00:11:05,697 --> 00:11:07,978
By observing the irregularities, the
severe can be diagnosed from the menial.

215
00:11:09,137 --> 00:11:11,777
If so, how can I diagnose your illness

216
00:11:11,777 --> 00:11:14,017
just by reading your pulse?

217
00:11:14,657 --> 00:11:15,577
The word "I",

218
00:11:17,298 --> 00:11:18,457
that's our rule of measurement.

219
00:11:19,017 --> 00:11:21,178
I'm sure you guys know what a ruler is.

220
00:11:21,178 --> 00:11:22,738
It's not straight unless you adjust it.

221
00:11:24,097 --> 00:11:25,657
If you measure something with a ruler,

222
00:11:26,217 --> 00:11:28,418
how can I know that if I'm measuring it

223
00:11:28,418 --> 00:11:30,457
straight or not?

224
00:11:31,097 --> 00:11:32,217
Who will tell me that?

225
00:11:34,337 --> 00:11:35,337
Your dormmate will tell you that.

226
00:11:37,137 --> 00:11:38,378
Your classmates and teachers

227
00:11:38,378 --> 00:11:39,457
will tell you that.

228
00:11:40,217 --> 00:11:43,298
When you live together
with them all day long,

229
00:11:43,378 --> 00:11:45,777
they'll detect your flaws.

230
00:11:45,897 --> 00:11:47,457
They'll tell you your flaws

231
00:11:48,017 --> 00:11:49,298
so that you can rectify them.

232
00:11:53,978 --> 00:11:54,828
To sum it up,

233
00:11:55,657 --> 00:11:56,858
we're living together all day long

234
00:11:57,978 --> 00:11:59,498
in the first three months

235
00:12:00,017 --> 00:12:03,097
of the apprentice class

236
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:04,337
in order

237
00:12:04,978 --> 00:12:05,978
to know ourselves better.

238
00:12:23,137 --> 00:12:24,258
How much does this cost?

239
00:12:28,017 --> 00:12:29,017
75 yuan.

240
00:12:29,897 --> 00:12:31,418
For 75 yuan,

241
00:12:32,457 --> 00:12:34,217
Ms Yang has decided

242
00:12:34,897 --> 00:12:36,537
to learn how to handle

243
00:12:36,537 --> 00:12:39,457
her sour relationship with you
for a long period.

244
00:12:42,657 --> 00:12:44,777
The price isn't the issue here.

245
00:12:44,777 --> 00:12:45,897
If you wish to hold it against her,

246
00:12:46,738 --> 00:12:48,577
the price won't be the issue here.

247
00:12:48,577 --> 00:12:50,457
But if you try to be magnanimous
toward her,

248
00:12:51,217 --> 00:12:52,537
it won't even be an issue.

249
00:12:52,537 --> 00:12:53,738
It'll cease to be an issue then.

250
00:13:08,897 --> 00:13:09,733
Tou Tou,

251
00:13:10,337 --> 00:13:12,738
why does Mr Ren always side with you?

252
00:13:15,017 --> 00:13:16,097
He's my nephew.

253
00:13:16,097 --> 00:13:17,457
According to our seniority,

254
00:13:17,457 --> 00:13:19,017
he has to side with me

255
00:13:19,017 --> 00:13:20,058
out of respect,

256
00:13:20,577 --> 00:13:21,460
don't you think?

257
00:13:28,298 --> 00:13:30,017
As the saying goes,
joy puts heart into a man.

258
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:32,298
Mr Zheng, you're radiating with joy.

259
00:13:32,298 --> 00:13:33,537
Seems like you're confident

260
00:13:33,537 --> 00:13:36,160
that Hefeng Hall will
be listed by this year.

261
00:13:36,777 --> 00:13:38,938
I heard that the export sale
for your health drink

262
00:13:38,938 --> 00:13:41,217
doubled by this year.

263
00:13:41,217 --> 00:13:42,378
To be honest,

264
00:13:42,378 --> 00:13:43,657
our company used to focus on

265
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:45,777
producing medicine and injectables.

266
00:13:45,777 --> 00:13:46,618
But that field

267
00:13:46,657 --> 00:13:47,777
is fiercely competitive.

268
00:13:47,777 --> 00:13:50,618
-You're right.
-We have no advantage if we compare with

269
00:13:50,618 --> 00:13:52,657
those billion-dollar
pharmaceutical enterprises.

270
00:13:52,657 --> 00:13:55,137
Two years ago, Mr Ren
gave a seminar in our company.

271
00:13:55,137 --> 00:13:56,897
I was enlightened after that seminar.

272
00:13:56,897 --> 00:13:59,137
I focused my effort on producing
healthcare products

273
00:13:59,137 --> 00:14:00,457
and supplements after that.

274
00:14:01,337 --> 00:14:03,258
He even improved the formula
for our drinks.

275
00:14:03,337 --> 00:14:04,618
If we do get listed,

276
00:14:04,657 --> 00:14:06,137
Mr Ren will be the biggest contributor.

277
00:14:07,457 --> 00:14:08,777
I came here

278
00:14:08,777 --> 00:14:10,258
to thank Mr Ren personally.

279
00:14:11,457 --> 00:14:12,738
Is he performing outpatient duty now?

280
00:14:13,858 --> 00:14:14,978
Don't you know?

281
00:14:14,978 --> 00:14:16,978
Mr Ren has resigned from his post.

282
00:14:16,978 --> 00:14:20,217
He's holding a TCM apprentice class
outside of the academy.

283
00:14:20,217 --> 00:14:21,337
He resigned in order to hold a class?

284
00:14:23,457 --> 00:14:24,897
That's great.

285
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:27,978
Coincidentally, our company intends

286
00:14:27,978 --> 00:14:29,378
to raise the sum of the student grant

287
00:14:29,378 --> 00:14:31,217
for poor students studying
in the University of TCM.

288
00:14:31,217 --> 00:14:32,978
We can use it to support
the apprentice class fully.

289
00:14:32,978 --> 00:14:34,457
Wait, Mr Zheng.

290
00:14:35,858 --> 00:14:37,978
What do you mean by that?

291
00:14:38,097 --> 00:14:38,938
I'm sure you understand.

292
00:14:38,938 --> 00:14:41,418
Our company contributes 1.5 million yuan

293
00:14:41,577 --> 00:14:43,178
to Jiangzhou University
of Chinese Medicine every year

294
00:14:43,178 --> 00:14:44,738
for scholarship purposes.

295
00:14:44,738 --> 00:14:45,777
I know that.

296
00:14:45,777 --> 00:14:46,897
Correspondingly,

297
00:14:46,978 --> 00:14:48,777
Mr Ren will spend half a month

298
00:14:48,777 --> 00:14:50,017
during the summer and winter break

299
00:14:50,017 --> 00:14:52,818
to come to my company and provide us
with free seminars and diagnoses.

300
00:14:53,137 --> 00:14:54,217
-Mr Zheng.
-Therefore...

301
00:14:54,217 --> 00:14:56,017
If you're worried about the seminars,

302
00:14:56,017 --> 00:14:56,844
you won't need to worry.

303
00:14:57,457 --> 00:15:00,337
Mr Ren and I were peers for 30 years.

304
00:15:00,577 --> 00:15:01,537
I dare to promise you

305
00:15:01,537 --> 00:15:03,058
that I can deliver the same seminars
he can deliver.

306
00:15:03,137 --> 00:15:05,258
Regarding the seminars
and free diagnoses,

307
00:15:05,258 --> 00:15:07,017
you can just look for me.

308
00:15:07,017 --> 00:15:09,657
Our academy will support your company

309
00:15:09,858 --> 00:15:10,897
with everything we have.

310
00:15:13,777 --> 00:15:15,577
Professor Wu, of course
I have confidence in your standards.

311
00:15:17,097 --> 00:15:18,178
However, Mr Ren

312
00:15:18,178 --> 00:15:20,178
is our chief advisor.

313
00:15:20,298 --> 00:15:21,457
He helped me out a lot

314
00:15:21,457 --> 00:15:22,777
when I first started out.

315
00:15:22,938 --> 00:15:24,978
It would be inappropriate of me
to stop donating to the academy

316
00:15:24,978 --> 00:15:25,818
just because he left the academy.

317
00:15:25,818 --> 00:15:26,738
Don't you think so?

318
00:15:28,217 --> 00:15:29,457
Look at that senior of mine.

319
00:15:30,217 --> 00:15:32,378
People use public possessions
for private purposes.

320
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:35,017
But he's doing the opposite.

321
00:15:36,777 --> 00:15:38,097
I'm sure you all are tired

322
00:15:38,097 --> 00:15:39,337
after a long day of class.

323
00:15:41,097 --> 00:15:42,017
What about this?

324
00:15:42,017 --> 00:15:42,938
Let's play a game

325
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:45,418
at the end of the period.

326
00:15:47,537 --> 00:15:48,457
I want to play games!

327
00:15:48,457 --> 00:15:49,777
I'm in!

328
00:15:49,777 --> 00:15:50,671
Okay.

329
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:52,017
So, what game will we play today?

330
00:15:52,017 --> 00:15:53,938
We'll play "Guess The Riddle".

331
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,923
(Guess The Riddle)

332
00:15:58,777 --> 00:16:01,137
With Yin and Yang, it makes two.

333
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:04,777
That which ensues
as the result is goodness.

334
00:16:05,738 --> 00:16:08,337
That which shows it in its completeness
is the natures.

335
00:16:08,537 --> 00:16:11,097
The benevolent see it
and call it benevolence.

336
00:16:12,217 --> 00:16:15,258
The people use it every day,
yet they have no idea.

337
00:16:15,418 --> 00:16:16,357
Oh no.

338
00:16:16,577 --> 00:16:18,938
I don't get it.

339
00:16:18,938 --> 00:16:19,858
Me too.

340
00:16:19,858 --> 00:16:20,694
Yeah.

341
00:16:20,978 --> 00:16:22,017
Is it an object?

342
00:16:22,897 --> 00:16:23,817
That's right.

343
00:16:24,457 --> 00:16:25,697
How did you know it was an object?

344
00:16:25,738 --> 00:16:26,589
Roubecca.

345
00:16:26,978 --> 00:16:28,457
Do you hang it on the wall?

346
00:16:28,457 --> 00:16:29,858
Is it a type of food?

347
00:16:29,897 --> 00:16:31,537
It's a daily necessity.

348
00:16:33,097 --> 00:16:34,457
Daily necessity?

349
00:16:34,777 --> 00:16:35,858
I got it!

350
00:16:35,897 --> 00:16:36,742
Tell us.

351
00:16:36,858 --> 00:16:38,097
Body shampoo, shampoo,

352
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:39,577
toothpaste, a feet board,
pots and tools.

353
00:16:39,577 --> 00:16:40,938
One of them will be right.

354
00:16:42,897 --> 00:16:43,839
Thank you.

355
00:16:44,978 --> 00:16:45,841
Wrong answer.

356
00:16:46,777 --> 00:16:47,938
All of them are wrong.

357
00:16:48,537 --> 00:16:49,457
Everyone, listen.

358
00:16:49,457 --> 00:16:52,657
With Yin and Yang, it makes two.

359
00:16:54,657 --> 00:16:55,537
Think about it.

360
00:16:55,938 --> 00:16:56,818
Think about it.

361
00:16:58,337 --> 00:16:59,258
It's chopsticks.

362
00:17:00,657 --> 00:17:01,524
That's right.

363
00:17:02,537 --> 00:17:03,446
The answer is chopsticks.

364
00:17:04,097 --> 00:17:06,618
Tell them why.

365
00:17:06,618 --> 00:17:08,777
With Yin and Yang, it makes two.
That means it comes in pairs.

366
00:17:09,858 --> 00:17:11,178
Gloves come in pairs too, you know?

367
00:17:12,258 --> 00:17:13,618
Do you wear gloves during summer?

368
00:17:14,258 --> 00:17:16,457
The people use it every day,
yet they have no idea.

369
00:17:16,457 --> 00:17:18,378
Since they use it every day,
that shows the frequency.

370
00:17:18,378 --> 00:17:20,697
They don't know because
they are already used to using them.

371
00:17:20,697 --> 00:17:22,258
I read this article

372
00:17:22,258 --> 00:17:23,457
when I was in high school.

373
00:17:23,457 --> 00:17:24,897
It talked about chopsticks.

374
00:17:24,897 --> 00:17:27,657
Chopsticks are the culmination
of Chinese culture.

375
00:17:27,657 --> 00:17:29,378
That's right.

376
00:17:30,097 --> 00:17:31,024
The answer is chopsticks.

377
00:17:31,978 --> 00:17:33,498
Who can tell me

378
00:17:33,498 --> 00:17:34,418
which side

379
00:17:35,618 --> 00:17:37,818
is Yang and which side is Yin?

380
00:17:41,217 --> 00:17:43,258
The top is Yang

381
00:17:44,217 --> 00:17:46,017
while the bottom is Yin.

382
00:17:47,017 --> 00:17:48,137
The hand will be in the middle position.

383
00:17:49,657 --> 00:17:51,657
That's why I wanted you all
to maintain neutrality.

384
00:17:51,657 --> 00:17:52,818
If you hold your chopsticks well,

385
00:17:52,818 --> 00:17:55,378
you can pick up any food.

386
00:18:00,378 --> 00:18:02,418
So, as to why I talked about
chopsticks today,

387
00:18:02,418 --> 00:18:04,657
it's related to the main topic
of our next class.

388
00:18:04,657 --> 00:18:07,178
So, why do we call TCM practitioners
"Zhong Yi"?

389
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:09,618
Does the word "Zhong" mean "central"?

390
00:18:10,738 --> 00:18:11,738
Or does it mean "middle"?

391
00:18:13,978 --> 00:18:15,498
Stay tuned to the next class.

392
00:18:17,498 --> 00:18:18,479
By the way,

393
00:18:18,777 --> 00:18:20,337
the Qingming Festival is nearing.

394
00:18:21,097 --> 00:18:23,017
You guys have to prepare some offerings.

395
00:18:23,858 --> 00:18:25,298
Ms Song will teach you guys
how to make them.

396
00:18:25,618 --> 00:18:26,457
Since you won

397
00:18:26,978 --> 00:18:28,337
the riddle game today,

398
00:18:28,337 --> 00:18:30,378
you can do your own things tonight.

399
00:18:30,378 --> 00:18:31,337
Alright, guys.

400
00:18:31,978 --> 00:18:32,890
Class dismissed.

401
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:41,258
Mr Ren does impress me to no end.

402
00:18:41,378 --> 00:18:42,858
He kept telling me

403
00:18:43,018 --> 00:18:44,697
that we just need to hold a firm belief.

404
00:18:44,817 --> 00:18:46,337
If so, money will come to us

405
00:18:46,457 --> 00:18:47,898
when we need it the most.

406
00:18:48,138 --> 00:18:51,097
Lo and behold,
our God of Wealth has arrived.

407
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:54,138
We require a substantial amount of fund

408
00:18:54,138 --> 00:18:55,858
to maintain the apprentice class.

409
00:18:55,858 --> 00:18:57,337
Your two million yuan

410
00:18:57,337 --> 00:18:58,858
is godsend.

411
00:18:59,258 --> 00:19:00,217
We support each other.

412
00:19:01,018 --> 00:19:02,417
Naturally, Professor Ren
requires our help

413
00:19:02,498 --> 00:19:03,658
to spread his wisdom.

414
00:19:03,858 --> 00:19:04,738
Professor Ren

415
00:19:04,738 --> 00:19:06,177
deserves our help too.

416
00:19:06,258 --> 00:19:07,577
It was tough for me
to start my business back then.

417
00:19:07,738 --> 00:19:09,337
I had no directions at all.

418
00:19:09,457 --> 00:19:11,978
Professor Ren was the one
who taught me how to plant wormwood

419
00:19:12,138 --> 00:19:14,097
and wolfsbane.

420
00:19:14,097 --> 00:19:15,738
After I made my first pot of gold,

421
00:19:16,018 --> 00:19:18,378
Professor Ren was the one who helped me
to develop patented Chinese medicine.

422
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,764
To sum it up,

423
00:19:19,898 --> 00:19:21,778
my money is Professor Ren's.

424
00:19:22,618 --> 00:19:23,538
He just needs to tell me

425
00:19:23,658 --> 00:19:24,978
whenever he needs help.

426
00:19:27,378 --> 00:19:28,738
It's getting late.

427
00:19:30,258 --> 00:19:31,258
We'll make a move first.

428
00:19:31,258 --> 00:19:32,080
We'll stop interrupting you all.

429
00:19:33,258 --> 00:19:34,778
You came all the way here,

430
00:19:35,378 --> 00:19:37,138
yet you're leaving without seeing him?

431
00:19:37,858 --> 00:19:39,577
I think Senior will return soon.

432
00:19:39,577 --> 00:19:40,738
Have some tea.

433
00:19:40,738 --> 00:19:42,018
Here, have some tea.

434
00:19:45,097 --> 00:19:46,097
My dear bosses,

435
00:19:46,097 --> 00:19:48,457
what are you two doing here today?

436
00:19:51,337 --> 00:19:52,778
-Have a seat.
-Xin Cheng

437
00:19:52,778 --> 00:19:54,240
is here to deliver money to us.

438
00:19:54,738 --> 00:19:56,577
He transferred the scholarship
meant for the academy

439
00:19:56,577 --> 00:19:58,258
to our class.

440
00:19:58,258 --> 00:19:59,618
The academy doesn't need any money,

441
00:19:59,618 --> 00:20:01,217
but we need the money urgently.

442
00:20:05,258 --> 00:20:07,258
I cannot take the scholarship money.

443
00:20:07,618 --> 00:20:08,817
Why not?

444
00:20:08,898 --> 00:20:09,817
Look.

445
00:20:09,817 --> 00:20:11,858
The scholarship belongs to the academy.

446
00:20:12,138 --> 00:20:13,738
And I've already resigned.

447
00:20:14,778 --> 00:20:16,217
I can't just take the money with me

448
00:20:16,217 --> 00:20:17,858
after I've resigned from my post.

449
00:20:18,233 --> 00:20:19,105
Don't you think so?

450
00:20:19,658 --> 00:20:22,378
I know you're here to repay the favour.

451
00:20:22,378 --> 00:20:23,297
Actually, I just did

452
00:20:23,337 --> 00:20:26,217
what I was supposed to do
when I was still working in the academy.

453
00:20:26,217 --> 00:20:28,138
I need to thank the academy

454
00:20:28,138 --> 00:20:29,858
for helping me, supporting me,

455
00:20:29,858 --> 00:20:31,778
and providing me with
this many platforms.

456
00:20:31,778 --> 00:20:33,018
That's why I think you should

457
00:20:33,898 --> 00:20:35,217
keep the scholarship money
for the school.

458
00:20:35,258 --> 00:20:36,217
But

459
00:20:36,217 --> 00:20:38,457
the conditions here aren't too good.

460
00:20:38,978 --> 00:20:40,498
Your wife already told me

461
00:20:40,858 --> 00:20:42,018
that you guys were in
straitened circumstances.

462
00:20:42,018 --> 00:20:42,937
What about this?

463
00:20:43,538 --> 00:20:45,177
I'll reserve 1.5 million yuan
for the academy.

464
00:20:45,378 --> 00:20:47,138
You can have the rest, which is
500,000 yuan. What do you think?

465
00:20:51,258 --> 00:20:53,658
Helping poor students
to complete their study

466
00:20:53,658 --> 00:20:55,618
is a huge deal.

467
00:20:55,618 --> 00:20:56,778
You don't need

468
00:20:56,778 --> 00:20:58,177
to worry about me.

469
00:20:58,217 --> 00:20:59,124
That's right.

470
00:20:59,498 --> 00:21:01,738
Mr Ren is right.
We don't need any money.

471
00:21:05,618 --> 00:21:06,978
What about the seminars then?

472
00:21:06,978 --> 00:21:08,498
Mr Ren, my employees and clients

473
00:21:08,498 --> 00:21:09,858
are looking forward to your classes.

474
00:21:09,858 --> 00:21:11,937
I can guarantee this.

475
00:21:11,978 --> 00:21:12,924
Shan Dao

476
00:21:13,778 --> 00:21:15,097
is one of the best in our field

477
00:21:15,138 --> 00:21:16,378
when it comes to giving diagnoses
and seminars.

478
00:21:17,618 --> 00:21:19,898
I'm sure he can deliver
the seminars without any issues.

479
00:21:19,898 --> 00:21:20,782
That's right.

480
00:21:21,138 --> 00:21:22,138
Mr Ren,

481
00:21:22,138 --> 00:21:23,738
I definitely believe in your words.

482
00:21:24,738 --> 00:21:26,978
Mr Wu, I don't intend to be offensive.

483
00:21:26,978 --> 00:21:28,217
The entire Jiangzhou

484
00:21:28,217 --> 00:21:29,738
knows how good you are.

485
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:31,337
However, Professor Ren,

486
00:21:31,337 --> 00:21:33,738
the foreign clients we're dealing with

487
00:21:33,738 --> 00:21:35,138
are investing in us because of you.

488
00:21:35,138 --> 00:21:36,258
But now, you've resigned.

489
00:21:36,618 --> 00:21:38,177
I'll definitely deliver the seminars.

490
00:21:38,337 --> 00:21:39,378
Although I've resigned,

491
00:21:39,378 --> 00:21:41,417
I still care about the academy.

492
00:21:41,457 --> 00:21:42,258
Don't worry about it.

493
00:21:42,258 --> 00:21:43,778
But I have one condition.

494
00:21:43,778 --> 00:21:44,617
Shan Dao,

495
00:21:45,018 --> 00:21:46,538
see if this will work.

496
00:21:47,138 --> 00:21:48,138
Both of us can deliver

497
00:21:48,138 --> 00:21:49,417
the seminars in turn.

498
00:21:50,858 --> 00:21:52,378
-What do you think?
-No problem.

499
00:21:53,658 --> 00:21:54,937
You're lucky that you're able

500
00:21:55,097 --> 00:21:56,978
to get Shan Dao to deliver seminars,
you know?

501
00:22:07,018 --> 00:22:08,297
What time is it?

502
00:22:08,297 --> 00:22:10,217
Why isn't Tou Tou
calling us for dinner yet?

503
00:22:10,217 --> 00:22:11,738
I told the students

504
00:22:11,738 --> 00:22:14,258
that you're skipping dinner tonight.

505
00:22:15,538 --> 00:22:17,057
I taught them the entire day, you know?

506
00:22:17,057 --> 00:22:18,217
Now, I can't even eat?

507
00:22:18,778 --> 00:22:19,662
We're penniless.

508
00:22:23,378 --> 00:22:24,937
Wu Shan Dao is the worst.

509
00:22:24,937 --> 00:22:26,658
Did Shan Dao offend you somehow?

510
00:22:28,018 --> 00:22:29,417
You can never accept

511
00:22:29,457 --> 00:22:30,378
Zheng Xin Cheng's money

512
00:22:30,378 --> 00:22:31,937
under his supervision.

513
00:22:33,217 --> 00:22:35,618
If you do, he'll spread rumours
about you.

514
00:22:36,138 --> 00:22:38,138
He'll say that Ren Xin Zheng
burns his bridges

515
00:22:38,138 --> 00:22:39,457
after crossing them.

516
00:22:40,337 --> 00:22:41,618
Nonsense.

517
00:22:43,018 --> 00:22:44,658
Even if Shan Dao wasn't there,

518
00:22:44,658 --> 00:22:45,978
I wouldn't accept the money too.

519
00:22:46,258 --> 00:22:47,160
Yeah, yeah.

520
00:22:47,457 --> 00:22:48,738
You're the good guy here.

521
00:22:49,378 --> 00:22:50,618
I have to endure all these hardships
because of you.

522
00:22:58,337 --> 00:23:01,138
We haven't run out of food yet, right?

523
00:23:10,018 --> 00:23:11,378
If you're that capable,

524
00:23:11,378 --> 00:23:12,738
you shouldn't use my parents' money.

525
00:23:14,258 --> 00:23:15,457
If you're that capable,

526
00:23:15,457 --> 00:23:16,738
don't spend the medical centre's money.

527
00:23:23,378 --> 00:23:24,898
It's all because I love Master.

528
00:23:24,898 --> 00:23:26,817
I wouldn't have married you

529
00:23:26,817 --> 00:23:28,258
if I didn't love Master.

530
00:23:28,258 --> 00:23:29,738
Master is a generous person.

531
00:23:31,898 --> 00:23:33,457
You don't take after him at all.

532
00:23:39,978 --> 00:23:40,852
Do you need anything?

533
00:23:43,378 --> 00:23:45,258
Madam, I just wish to ask you

534
00:23:45,258 --> 00:23:47,378
if you're still teaching us
how to fold paper ingots tonight?

535
00:23:53,538 --> 00:23:54,353
Of course.

536
00:23:54,378 --> 00:23:55,538
You guys can prepare
the materials first.

537
00:23:56,378 --> 00:23:57,457
If so, I'll head there first.

538
00:24:25,778 --> 00:24:26,607
Don't lick it.

539
00:24:27,138 --> 00:24:28,858
Tin is a type of heavy metal.
It's poisonous.

540
00:24:30,498 --> 00:24:31,978
You could've told me earlier!

541
00:24:31,978 --> 00:24:33,498
I think I'm poisoned by now.

542
00:24:37,498 --> 00:24:38,498
Niece-in-law,

543
00:24:38,498 --> 00:24:39,618
I searched for this online.

544
00:24:40,018 --> 00:24:42,858
They sell 1,000 of this
for 30 yuan online.

545
00:24:43,258 --> 00:24:45,177
Aren't we wasting our time and energy

546
00:24:45,477 --> 00:24:46,310
if we fold them one by one?

547
00:24:46,778 --> 00:24:49,097
Tou, will you fork out the 30 yuan then?

548
00:24:50,018 --> 00:24:51,217
Of course not.

549
00:24:51,258 --> 00:24:52,258
I'm penniless.

550
00:24:52,258 --> 00:24:53,149
Tou Tou,

551
00:24:53,378 --> 00:24:54,457
this is a token of appreciation.

552
00:24:55,138 --> 00:24:57,978
It's a way we show our respect
to our predecessors.

553
00:24:57,978 --> 00:25:00,258
Now, we live in a modern era.

554
00:25:00,258 --> 00:25:02,097
If you want to contact someone,

555
00:25:02,097 --> 00:25:04,618
not only can you listen to their voice,

556
00:25:04,618 --> 00:25:06,018
but you can also

557
00:25:06,738 --> 00:25:08,337
see them on the screen
through a video call.

558
00:25:08,337 --> 00:25:09,618
It's different from the past.

559
00:25:09,618 --> 00:25:12,258
In the past, it took one year
to deliver a letter.

560
00:25:12,258 --> 00:25:14,138
Now, our lifestyle has changed.

561
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:17,378
However, some things will never change.

562
00:25:17,378 --> 00:25:19,618
Just like what Mr Ren had taught today.

563
00:25:20,217 --> 00:25:22,658
If there is constant movement,

564
00:25:22,658 --> 00:25:24,258
there is non-movement too.

565
00:25:24,258 --> 00:25:25,378
If you understand the way of the world,

566
00:25:25,378 --> 00:25:27,778
you'll understand the concept
of Yin and Yang naturally.

567
00:25:27,778 --> 00:25:29,297
What are the things
that won't change then?

568
00:25:29,297 --> 00:25:31,378
I used to think that
I would never get a raise.

569
00:25:31,378 --> 00:25:33,177
Now, I got my raise.

570
00:25:34,498 --> 00:25:36,658
The only things that won't change
are the feelings of humans.

571
00:25:38,097 --> 00:25:39,618
A few thousand years ago,

572
00:25:39,618 --> 00:25:41,097
if one's parent passed away,

573
00:25:41,097 --> 00:25:42,618
they would cry.

574
00:25:42,618 --> 00:25:44,217
Even after several thousand years,

575
00:25:44,858 --> 00:25:45,722
it's still the same.

576
00:25:49,378 --> 00:25:50,337
Roubecca,

577
00:25:50,858 --> 00:25:52,177
what is that?

578
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:53,618
It looks like a cake.

579
00:25:53,618 --> 00:25:55,258
That's a Lotus Pagoda.

580
00:25:55,258 --> 00:25:56,520
Lotus Pagoda?

581
00:25:56,978 --> 00:25:59,538
I thought you never participated
in any group activities?

582
00:25:59,538 --> 00:26:01,778
And, my nephew said you could
have the night off too.

583
00:26:01,778 --> 00:26:02,920
Why are you still here?

584
00:26:03,457 --> 00:26:04,337
I'm here to show my sincerity.

585
00:26:05,858 --> 00:26:07,138
This is my token of appreciation.

586
00:26:10,138 --> 00:26:11,138
Ms Song,

587
00:26:11,138 --> 00:26:15,138
I wish to take a day off
during Qingming Festival.

588
00:26:15,138 --> 00:26:16,297
That won't do.

589
00:26:16,337 --> 00:26:18,538
This is the first time
the apprentice class

590
00:26:19,258 --> 00:26:20,658
will be sweeping the graves
of our predecessors.

591
00:26:21,258 --> 00:26:24,138
I hope everyone can attend it.

592
00:26:24,138 --> 00:26:24,961
Is that okay?

593
00:26:27,378 --> 00:26:28,258
Actually,

594
00:26:29,138 --> 00:26:31,258
I just want to sweep my mother's grave.

595
00:26:39,498 --> 00:26:40,391
Okay.

596
00:26:41,618 --> 00:26:42,937
I'll tell Mr Ren

597
00:26:43,498 --> 00:26:45,417
to give you some time off
after sweeping our predecessors' graves.

598
00:26:45,858 --> 00:26:46,978
You're smart and talented.

599
00:26:47,258 --> 00:26:49,378
Skipping one class
won't affect your study.

600
00:26:50,858 --> 00:26:52,177
Thank you, Ms Song.

601
00:26:59,378 --> 00:27:00,658
What do you mean by that?

602
00:27:00,858 --> 00:27:03,018
Is Roubecca the only smart one here?

603
00:27:03,018 --> 00:27:03,978
Am I not smart?

604
00:27:03,978 --> 00:27:05,658
Do you mean that I cannot afford
to skip any classes?

605
00:27:05,658 --> 00:27:06,738
That's not what she meant.

606
00:27:07,778 --> 00:27:09,297
Ms Song was saying

607
00:27:09,337 --> 00:27:10,738
that you skipping classes or not

608
00:27:10,738 --> 00:27:12,778
won't affect you either way.

609
00:27:15,018 --> 00:27:16,738
Won't affect me either way?

610
00:27:18,258 --> 00:27:20,738
Peng Shi Yan, I thought
you were complimenting me!

611
00:27:20,738 --> 00:27:22,018
Now that I think about it...

612
00:27:22,018 --> 00:27:22,928
Tou Tou.

613
00:27:24,778 --> 00:27:25,738
Sit here.

614
00:27:25,738 --> 00:27:27,097
Fold one and show it to me.

615
00:27:33,738 --> 00:27:34,738
I licked it again.

616
00:27:35,618 --> 00:27:37,057
If I lick it again,

617
00:27:37,057 --> 00:27:38,978
you guys have to clean my grave
next year.

618
00:27:40,378 --> 00:27:41,858
Give it a few more licks then.

619
00:27:43,538 --> 00:27:44,450
Tian Zhen.

620
00:27:47,858 --> 00:27:48,770
Tian Zhen.

621
00:28:03,618 --> 00:28:04,528
Get up.

622
00:28:16,337 --> 00:28:17,245
Wing Chun.

623
00:28:17,498 --> 00:28:18,358
Ip Man.

624
00:28:20,498 --> 00:28:21,658
Okay. Push me.

625
00:28:29,978 --> 00:28:31,258
Be gentle.

626
00:28:38,618 --> 00:28:39,619
Tou Tou,

627
00:28:40,498 --> 00:28:45,457
Your legs are long, slender and toned.

628
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:47,898
I'm completely under your spell.

629
00:28:48,498 --> 00:28:49,378
Is that so?

630
00:28:50,258 --> 00:28:51,778
Do my legs look that nice?

631
00:28:51,778 --> 00:28:53,378
Are they so nice that you have to kneel
and submit to me?

632
00:28:55,498 --> 00:28:59,018
But your face...

633
00:29:03,337 --> 00:29:04,378
What's wrong with my face?

634
00:29:06,538 --> 00:29:07,404
What?

635
00:29:10,097 --> 00:29:12,280
Your face...

636
00:29:12,858 --> 00:29:13,711
What's wrong with my face?

637
00:29:14,233 --> 00:29:15,173
Don't move.

638
00:29:24,577 --> 00:29:26,080
She does look like a man, huh?

639
00:29:27,138 --> 00:29:28,060
Ren Tian Zhen!

640
00:29:28,658 --> 00:29:29,506
Have you lost your mind?

641
00:29:33,144 --> 00:29:34,544
-What are you doing?
-Tian Zhen, you're something else.

642
00:29:36,057 --> 00:29:36,871
Sun Tou Tou.

643
00:29:45,778 --> 00:29:47,417
You guys are energetic indeed.

644
00:29:48,097 --> 00:29:49,177
What about this?

645
00:29:49,378 --> 00:29:52,217
You two can maintain this posture.

646
00:29:52,498 --> 00:29:54,018
Maintain it for an hour.

647
00:29:55,018 --> 00:29:56,018
This is unfair.

648
00:29:57,018 --> 00:29:59,217
I'm bending my waist while he's sitting.

649
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:01,498
I'll definitely be more tired than him.

650
00:30:01,898 --> 00:30:02,795
Tian Zhen,

651
00:30:02,898 --> 00:30:03,843
let go of her first.

652
00:30:06,378 --> 00:30:08,538
You two, do your horse stance
in front of the wall.

653
00:30:08,697 --> 00:30:10,658
You're biased toward your son.

654
00:30:10,858 --> 00:30:11,892
Lift your leg.

655
00:30:13,498 --> 00:30:14,330
Get up.

656
00:30:23,258 --> 00:30:24,658
I know my son well.

657
00:30:25,538 --> 00:30:27,138
He would never do anything to you

658
00:30:27,138 --> 00:30:28,297
if you didn't provoke him first.

659
00:30:29,018 --> 00:30:30,738
He learned Wushu from

660
00:30:30,738 --> 00:30:32,018
a national champion at a young age.

661
00:30:32,018 --> 00:30:33,538
Do you think you can defeat him?

662
00:30:33,538 --> 00:30:35,057
Your bones would've been broken

663
00:30:35,057 --> 00:30:36,258
if he wanted to beat you up.

664
00:30:37,738 --> 00:30:39,217
Your son was the one

665
00:30:39,417 --> 00:30:42,138
who said I looked like a man.

666
00:30:47,138 --> 00:30:48,697
Is everyone happy with the outfit?

667
00:30:48,697 --> 00:30:49,498
Yes.

668
00:30:49,498 --> 00:30:51,018
-Yeah.
-No.

669
00:30:52,498 --> 00:30:53,618
Why not?

670
00:30:56,138 --> 00:30:59,538
I don't want to wear dresses.

671
00:30:59,778 --> 00:31:01,498
I think the design is wrong.

672
00:31:01,618 --> 00:31:03,538
I wish to wear trousers like them.

673
00:31:04,337 --> 00:31:05,297
But why?

674
00:31:07,018 --> 00:31:08,258
I don't like this costume.

675
00:31:10,258 --> 00:31:13,697
Formal dresses like these
are more restrictive

676
00:31:13,697 --> 00:31:14,858
than the usual clothing.

677
00:31:15,898 --> 00:31:19,217
However, we have to wear them during

678
00:31:19,858 --> 00:31:21,177
festive and important occasions.

679
00:31:22,217 --> 00:31:23,378
That's called courtesy.

680
00:31:24,138 --> 00:31:25,618
You feel uncomfortable wearing it

681
00:31:25,618 --> 00:31:26,898
because you don't conform to courtesy.

682
00:31:28,258 --> 00:31:30,177
Do you think you'll find another girl

683
00:31:30,217 --> 00:31:31,978
jumping around like a monkey
just like you?

684
00:31:34,018 --> 00:31:36,217
If you sit and stand properly,

685
00:31:36,217 --> 00:31:37,898
you won't feel uncomfortable.

686
00:31:37,898 --> 00:31:39,457
Why don't you tie me up then?

687
00:31:39,498 --> 00:31:40,858
I won't jump around by then.

688
00:31:42,498 --> 00:31:43,898
Ms Song, I have a climbing rope.

689
00:31:43,898 --> 00:31:45,258
-Telling Tou Tou to wear a dress
-It's sturdy.

690
00:31:45,258 --> 00:31:46,738
-is pretty difficult for her.
-Can you shut up?

691
00:31:48,898 --> 00:31:50,577
Class Leader, you do live up
to your name as our class leader.

692
00:31:51,978 --> 00:31:53,618
Why don't we leave her here
during Qingming Festival?

693
00:31:53,618 --> 00:31:54,538
You should stay here instead!

694
00:31:55,337 --> 00:31:56,378
Listen.

695
00:31:56,378 --> 00:31:57,937
I'll definitely sweep the graves.

696
00:31:57,978 --> 00:31:59,018
I'll do it even if it means
I have to wear dresses

697
00:31:59,538 --> 00:32:01,018
or walk on stilts.

698
00:32:02,018 --> 00:32:02,899
Tou Tou,

699
00:32:03,618 --> 00:32:05,057
isn't it cold when you're bare-legged?

700
00:32:07,138 --> 00:32:07,937
Nope.

701
00:32:07,937 --> 00:32:09,337
All of you are bare-legged
as well, right?

702
00:32:10,498 --> 00:32:11,858
We're wearing

703
00:32:11,858 --> 00:32:13,498
leggings.

704
00:32:15,738 --> 00:32:16,937
What is that?

705
00:32:16,978 --> 00:32:17,898
Leggings?

706
00:32:22,018 --> 00:32:22,978
It looks like she's wearing nothing.

707
00:32:23,738 --> 00:32:25,817
This must be the
Eighth Wonder of the World.

708
00:32:25,817 --> 00:32:26,738
All of you are wearing it?

709
00:32:26,738 --> 00:32:27,738
Fine.

710
00:32:28,858 --> 00:32:29,817
I'll buy one for you.

711
00:32:31,738 --> 00:32:33,018
I knew my niece-in-law
loves me the most.

712
00:32:35,258 --> 00:32:37,378
If you guys are okay with your outfits,

713
00:32:38,018 --> 00:32:40,018
remember to wash it.

714
00:32:40,018 --> 00:32:41,778
We'll wear it during Qingming Festival.

715
00:32:42,378 --> 00:32:43,315
Okay.

716
00:32:43,618 --> 00:32:44,778
Alright, meeting dismissed.

717
00:32:53,217 --> 00:32:55,658
The dishes we need to offer
to our predecessors

718
00:32:55,898 --> 00:32:57,138
need to be made personally,

719
00:32:57,378 --> 00:32:58,337
including qingtuan.

720
00:32:58,858 --> 00:32:59,778
That's why you need to prepare

721
00:32:59,778 --> 00:33:01,738
the necessary ingredients
within the next few days.

722
00:33:03,738 --> 00:33:04,663
Wait.

723
00:33:05,738 --> 00:33:07,297
I wouldn't have celebrated the festival
with you guys

724
00:33:07,297 --> 00:33:08,978
had I known that
it was this troublesome.

725
00:33:14,858 --> 00:33:16,097
Mum, this is too tight.

726
00:33:16,097 --> 00:33:16,978
It's choking me.

727
00:33:16,978 --> 00:33:18,138
What are you saying?

728
00:33:18,738 --> 00:33:20,378
Look. It's done now.

729
00:33:21,378 --> 00:33:22,498
You little fool.

730
00:33:22,498 --> 00:33:23,457
Alright. Get in the car.

731
00:33:23,457 --> 00:33:24,365
Alright.

732
00:33:24,738 --> 00:33:25,621
Morning, Ms Song.

733
00:33:26,097 --> 00:33:26,970
Morning.

734
00:33:29,378 --> 00:33:30,297
There are...

735
00:33:30,337 --> 00:33:31,618
We still have plenty of things to take!

736
00:33:31,618 --> 00:33:32,498
Slow down. Don't fall down.

737
00:33:32,498 --> 00:33:33,577
We still have plenty of things to bring!

738
00:33:34,138 --> 00:33:35,028
Tou Tou!

739
00:33:35,978 --> 00:33:37,738
Why don't you wear the leggings
I bought for you?

740
00:33:39,018 --> 00:33:40,538
It's too girlish.

741
00:33:40,538 --> 00:33:41,858
And, it's too tight. I don't want
to wear something like that.

742
00:33:43,978 --> 00:33:44,839
Slow down.

743
00:33:47,858 --> 00:33:49,057
Guys, as you can see,

744
00:33:49,097 --> 00:33:51,217
I can't keep that girl in check.

745
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:52,880
Shan Dao, I'll leave her to you.

746
00:33:53,457 --> 00:33:54,978
I dare not say anything to her.

747
00:33:54,978 --> 00:33:56,538
She's my senior uncle after all.

748
00:33:57,217 --> 00:33:58,036
Calm down.

749
00:33:58,658 --> 00:33:59,490
Let's be patient.

750
00:34:00,018 --> 00:34:00,888
500 years.

751
00:34:01,217 --> 00:34:02,738
I'm sure we can transform her
within 500 years.

752
00:34:02,738 --> 00:34:03,618
500 years?

753
00:34:04,217 --> 00:34:05,898
I'll be a demon by then.

754
00:34:07,538 --> 00:34:09,018
Xuanzang turned a monkey

755
00:34:09,018 --> 00:34:10,138
into a cultivator.

756
00:34:10,138 --> 00:34:12,337
Now, we're just trying to turn a tomboy

757
00:34:12,337 --> 00:34:14,097
into a girl.

758
00:34:14,778 --> 00:34:16,057
It's much simpler.

759
00:34:16,898 --> 00:34:18,817
Mr Ren,

760
00:34:18,817 --> 00:34:21,697
you were very strict with your student
in the past.

761
00:34:21,738 --> 00:34:23,618
All students tremble in fear
when they see you.

762
00:34:23,858 --> 00:34:25,258
But why are you so biased toward

763
00:34:26,186 --> 00:34:27,466
Tou Tou?

764
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,160
He doesn't uphold his principles
at all, does he?

765
00:34:30,097 --> 00:34:30,975
Mr Ren,

766
00:34:31,258 --> 00:34:32,138
I have the same question.

767
00:34:32,378 --> 00:34:33,255
Is that true?

768
00:34:33,858 --> 00:34:34,742
What do you think?

769
00:34:39,138 --> 00:34:41,138
-You caught the flu?
-Take the flu medicine now.

770
00:34:41,138 --> 00:34:43,177
Your pulse was pretty weak
when I read it today.

771
00:34:43,538 --> 00:34:44,395
I brought it with me.

772
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:45,378
I'll take it in the car.

773
00:34:45,378 --> 00:34:47,018
I'm ready! Let's go!

774
00:34:53,018 --> 00:34:54,724
(Weather turns warmer,)

775
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,105
(and the plants sprout.)

776
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,202
(Clear scenery and weather,)

777
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,286
(all things are revitalized.)

778
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,271
(Qingming (Pure Brightness))

779
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,544
(Mount Huafeng)

780
00:35:21,057 --> 00:35:21,917
Tian Zhen.

781
00:35:30,498 --> 00:35:31,457
Nephew.

782
00:35:32,097 --> 00:35:32,954
Nephew!

783
00:35:34,658 --> 00:35:35,503
Your wife...

784
00:35:36,297 --> 00:35:38,858
She tied a red knot behind every tree.

785
00:35:38,858 --> 00:35:41,217
What kind of ritual is that?

786
00:35:41,217 --> 00:35:42,898
Are you going to summon

787
00:35:42,898 --> 00:35:43,738
all the lost souls here?

788
00:35:43,738 --> 00:35:45,217
It feels inauspicious to me.

789
00:35:45,217 --> 00:35:46,657
Guys, listen up.

790
00:35:47,578 --> 00:35:50,738
There are many forked paths
in this mountain.

791
00:35:51,617 --> 00:35:53,217
When we're descending the mountain,

792
00:35:53,258 --> 00:35:54,538
if you get separated from the group,

793
00:35:54,538 --> 00:35:56,498
just follow the red knots down

794
00:35:57,137 --> 00:35:58,338
and you'll be fine.

795
00:35:58,338 --> 00:36:00,738
Please don't get separated.

796
00:36:00,738 --> 00:36:03,457
There are wolves, bears,

797
00:36:03,457 --> 00:36:04,657
and boars here.

798
00:36:05,137 --> 00:36:06,697
You guys must be careful.

799
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:08,992
-Alright.
-Are you trying to deceive a kid here?

800
00:36:09,137 --> 00:36:10,778
I'm sure this path is frequently used.

801
00:36:10,778 --> 00:36:12,578
How could there be wolves, bears,

802
00:36:12,578 --> 00:36:13,897
or wild beasts here?

803
00:36:14,818 --> 00:36:15,738
There weren't any in the past.

804
00:36:15,738 --> 00:36:16,857
But now,

805
00:36:17,098 --> 00:36:18,538
it's been over two decades.

806
00:36:18,818 --> 00:36:20,417
The local youngsters

807
00:36:20,417 --> 00:36:21,818
had moved to the city
in search of better jobs.

808
00:36:22,018 --> 00:36:24,978
Their parents are old now.

809
00:36:24,978 --> 00:36:26,258
Some of them have passed away too.

810
00:36:26,897 --> 00:36:28,778
Therefore, some of the houses here

811
00:36:28,778 --> 00:36:29,857
are abandoned.

812
00:36:29,857 --> 00:36:30,778
That's how this forest

813
00:36:30,778 --> 00:36:32,578
grew gradually.

814
00:36:33,217 --> 00:36:34,098
And that's why

815
00:36:34,657 --> 00:36:35,778
there are wild beasts lurking around.

816
00:36:36,377 --> 00:36:37,377
Come on, let's go.

817
00:36:48,578 --> 00:36:49,457
Ling Lan.

818
00:36:50,137 --> 00:36:51,076
Coming.

819
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:59,417
I thought animal dungs
were natural fertilizers?

820
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:00,538
Why are you picking them up?

821
00:37:00,538 --> 00:37:01,578
This is a type of herb.

822
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:03,009
A type of herb?

823
00:37:04,298 --> 00:37:05,818
Guys, look.

824
00:37:05,818 --> 00:37:07,738
Have you guys tried doing
any pharmacological experiments?

825
00:37:08,018 --> 00:37:09,098
When I was in college,

826
00:37:09,098 --> 00:37:11,018
I studied basic TCM theories.

827
00:37:11,177 --> 00:37:13,258
I know that bat dung
is good for the eyes.

828
00:37:13,338 --> 00:37:14,697
It's known as Faeces Vespertilionum.

829
00:37:14,897 --> 00:37:16,058
But I'm perplexed.

830
00:37:16,258 --> 00:37:17,818
Bats consume different food every day.

831
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:18,857
They produce different dung every day.

832
00:37:18,857 --> 00:37:20,738
How could you guys know which bat dung

833
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:21,857
could cure blindness?

834
00:37:22,457 --> 00:37:23,338
How do I put it?

835
00:37:23,457 --> 00:37:24,738
Don't you think it's too irresponsible

836
00:37:24,738 --> 00:37:25,578
for you guys to collect random dung

837
00:37:25,657 --> 00:37:26,818
for your patients?

838
00:37:27,538 --> 00:37:29,857
If so, the civet coffee
you like so much,

839
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:32,137
do you think they're the same

840
00:37:32,177 --> 00:37:33,098
if you test them?

841
00:37:33,818 --> 00:37:34,697
They're different, right?

842
00:37:35,417 --> 00:37:38,538
TCM practitioners aren't the only ones
utilizing animal dungs.

843
00:37:38,697 --> 00:37:40,937
You shouldn't belittle them.

844
00:37:40,978 --> 00:37:42,457
Everything exists

845
00:37:42,457 --> 00:37:45,098
for its own reason.

846
00:37:46,217 --> 00:37:47,738
Some animal dungs

847
00:37:48,018 --> 00:37:49,538
are worth more than gold.

848
00:37:49,738 --> 00:37:51,217
You guys can search for it online.

849
00:37:51,217 --> 00:37:53,897
This dung costs around
8,000 to 10,000 yuan

850
00:37:54,937 --> 00:37:56,498
per gram.

851
00:37:57,177 --> 00:37:57,978
What kind of animal?

852
00:37:58,538 --> 00:38:00,784
What kind of animal is that valuable?

853
00:38:00,937 --> 00:38:02,018
Their dung is that expensive?

854
00:38:02,897 --> 00:38:04,738
Tell me what kind of animal it is.
I'll go and keep one.

855
00:38:04,738 --> 00:38:06,338
After that, I'll wait for it to poop.

856
00:38:06,338 --> 00:38:07,578
I'll sell its dung for money.

857
00:38:08,217 --> 00:38:11,897
It's called a sperm whale.

858
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:14,538
A sperm whale

859
00:38:14,538 --> 00:38:17,778
is around 50 tons heavy.

860
00:38:17,778 --> 00:38:18,778
Do you think you can keep one?

861
00:38:20,818 --> 00:38:21,760
You can't, right?

862
00:38:22,417 --> 00:38:24,617
A sperm whale's dung is called

863
00:38:24,897 --> 00:38:27,498
ambergris.

864
00:38:28,177 --> 00:38:30,058
We use it to make incense,

865
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:31,617
perfumes,

866
00:38:31,617 --> 00:38:32,498
and so on.

867
00:38:32,498 --> 00:38:34,058
It's an amazing material.

868
00:38:34,058 --> 00:38:36,137
So, you guys mustn't look down
on animal dungs.

869
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,578
In Compendium of Materia Medica,

870
00:38:37,578 --> 00:38:39,617
there are many kinds

871
00:38:39,657 --> 00:38:40,897
of animal dungs

872
00:38:41,377 --> 00:38:42,498
that have TCM applications.

873
00:38:43,217 --> 00:38:46,657
Let's take Wulingzhi as an example.

874
00:38:46,897 --> 00:38:48,058
Even now, the field of TCM
is still using it.

875
00:38:48,177 --> 00:38:50,258
So, what's the similarity between

876
00:38:50,258 --> 00:38:51,243
TCM and Western medicine?

877
00:38:51,457 --> 00:38:54,457
Both fields hope that humans
can live healthily.

878
00:38:55,258 --> 00:38:56,249
If they're unhealthy,

879
00:38:57,018 --> 00:38:59,177
if we have to sustain their lives
with medicine and machines,

880
00:38:59,217 --> 00:39:00,697
that's not called longevity.

881
00:39:00,697 --> 00:39:02,058
That's

882
00:39:02,697 --> 00:39:04,258
torture.

883
00:39:05,498 --> 00:39:07,298
Nephew, where's the animal then?

884
00:39:07,578 --> 00:39:08,457
Where can I find one?

885
00:39:08,457 --> 00:39:09,258
In the sea.

886
00:39:09,538 --> 00:39:10,397
Let's go.

887
00:39:11,538 --> 00:39:13,780
How much is that dung worth?

888
00:39:58,738 --> 00:40:00,738
Say, although we're in the wilderness,

889
00:40:00,738 --> 00:40:01,937
people do come here often.

890
00:40:01,937 --> 00:40:04,738
Even the fruits here are fresh.

891
00:40:04,738 --> 00:40:05,738
Am I right, Nephew?

892
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:07,937
Mr Huang Mei

893
00:40:08,498 --> 00:40:09,697
is a renowned figure.

894
00:40:10,457 --> 00:40:11,738
He's well-known throughout the land.

895
00:40:12,738 --> 00:40:14,217
Although he has passed away
for several decades,

896
00:40:14,778 --> 00:40:16,578
people still worship him.

897
00:40:19,018 --> 00:40:19,885
What?

898
00:40:20,338 --> 00:40:21,258
Come here.

899
00:40:21,258 --> 00:40:22,298
What are you doing?

900
00:40:22,498 --> 00:40:24,417
We'll worship our predecessors soon.
Your attire must be tidy.

901
00:40:25,258 --> 00:40:26,177
Come here.

902
00:40:29,498 --> 00:40:30,417
My attire is tidy.

903
00:40:30,417 --> 00:40:32,417
I'm wearing extra pants.

904
00:40:34,457 --> 00:40:35,370
Button up.

905
00:40:40,818 --> 00:40:41,734
Tou Tou,

906
00:40:42,338 --> 00:40:43,978
observe closely.

907
00:40:45,018 --> 00:40:47,377
You're the successor of
the Jiang family's acupuncture sect.

908
00:40:48,018 --> 00:40:49,417
You'll be the one leading the sect

909
00:40:49,498 --> 00:40:52,217
and the younger generations to worship

910
00:40:52,538 --> 00:40:54,978
our predecessors in the future.

911
00:40:57,578 --> 00:40:58,617
Guys,

912
00:40:58,617 --> 00:41:00,538
since today is Qingming Festival...

913
00:41:00,538 --> 00:41:01,818
We'll take a day off then.

914
00:41:10,098 --> 00:41:12,377
Qingming Festival is one of
the 24 Solar Terms.

915
00:41:14,018 --> 00:41:15,298
According to
Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic,

916
00:41:15,298 --> 00:41:17,857
humans are connected
to Heaven and Earth.

917
00:41:18,978 --> 00:41:20,018
If so, those who are sick

918
00:41:21,018 --> 00:41:23,338
are not in sync with Heaven and Earth.

919
00:41:23,338 --> 00:41:25,338
If so, what do we examine
if we're TCM practitioners?

920
00:41:25,338 --> 00:41:28,217
We examine the person who is sick,

921
00:41:28,217 --> 00:41:30,098
not the disease they have.

922
00:41:31,258 --> 00:41:33,738
We need to make people
in sync with Heaven and Earth.

923
00:41:33,937 --> 00:41:36,217
We need to let them know
the change of the seasons

924
00:41:36,498 --> 00:41:37,978
and where their hearts belong.

925
00:41:38,217 --> 00:41:39,738
That way, they won't deviate
from the central path.

926
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:41,383
Second,

927
00:41:41,538 --> 00:41:44,897
Qingming Festival is an important time
for us to worship our predecessors.

928
00:41:45,018 --> 00:41:46,578
If so, I hope

929
00:41:47,417 --> 00:41:48,697
that everyone

930
00:41:49,018 --> 00:41:52,298
can worship our predecessors
with sincerity.

931
00:42:05,217 --> 00:42:06,457
Tou Tou, bow.

932
00:42:08,098 --> 00:42:09,258
I don't know them.

933
00:42:09,258 --> 00:42:10,377
And, they're not your relatives.

934
00:42:10,377 --> 00:42:11,264
I think

935
00:42:11,738 --> 00:42:13,818
this is ridiculous.

936
00:42:14,697 --> 00:42:16,098
This is so strange.

937
00:42:23,018 --> 00:42:24,778
Let us read

938
00:42:25,937 --> 00:42:27,937
Virtue of A Great Physician
in front of Mr Huang's grave

939
00:42:27,937 --> 00:42:29,217
to comfort our predecessors.

940
00:42:29,457 --> 00:42:32,058
May we have successors and
our initial goals be unchanged.

941
00:42:32,058 --> 00:42:33,417
Healing the wounded and
rescuing the dying

942
00:42:33,417 --> 00:42:34,657
are my ambitions.

943
00:42:35,657 --> 00:42:37,298
Virtue of A Great Physician.

944
00:42:37,298 --> 00:42:38,498
Even if you read it,

945
00:42:38,498 --> 00:42:39,818
do you think he can hear it?

946
00:42:40,818 --> 00:42:42,217
Even if we read together,

947
00:42:42,217 --> 00:42:44,457
can he hear us?

948
00:42:45,697 --> 00:42:46,581
He can't, right?

949
00:42:50,864 --> 00:42:52,212
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

950
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,351
(are referenced from relevant
traditional Chinese medicine books)

951
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,602
(Do not use without medical advice)
