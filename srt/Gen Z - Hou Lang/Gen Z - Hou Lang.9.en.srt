1
00:00:04,756 --> 00:00:05,673
Tian Zhen,

2
00:00:05,756 --> 00:00:07,352
call her family member.

3
00:00:07,435 --> 00:00:09,517
Tell him to bring their child here
to see her one last time.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,600
Okay.

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,200
Professor Ren!

6
00:00:13,756 --> 00:00:15,556
Holding onto me won't help you.

7
00:00:19,956 --> 00:00:20,956
Master,

8
00:00:21,276 --> 00:00:23,624
I just saw a dead person
for the first time in my life.

9
00:01:02,956 --> 00:01:04,000
What are you looking at?

10
00:01:05,755 --> 00:01:06,833
You scared me.

11
00:01:06,916 --> 00:01:08,438
You took the words out of my mouth!

12
00:01:13,155 --> 00:01:14,316
I'm exhausted.

13
00:01:16,795 --> 00:01:18,274
Besides giving patients diagnoses,

14
00:01:18,475 --> 00:01:20,258
I have to stay on my toes because of you.

15
00:01:20,555 --> 00:01:21,513
I'll bring the cops to you

16
00:01:21,596 --> 00:01:23,636
when they're here.

17
00:01:29,076 --> 00:01:30,072
Cheng Ying isn't dead.

18
00:01:30,155 --> 00:01:31,676
Why did you lie to her?

19
00:01:33,636 --> 00:01:35,235
You did great today.

20
00:01:36,636 --> 00:01:37,672
When you first came in,

21
00:01:37,755 --> 00:01:39,152
I thought you would run around,

22
00:01:39,235 --> 00:01:40,540
shouting that she wasn't dead.

23
00:01:45,515 --> 00:01:47,515
Am I that stupid to you?

24
00:01:50,716 --> 00:01:52,633
Although I don't know
why you're doing this,

25
00:01:52,716 --> 00:01:54,316
I know we're on the same side.

26
00:01:54,596 --> 00:01:56,115
I have to play my part well.

27
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,680
Don't you think so?

28
00:02:05,396 --> 00:02:07,036
My master was right indeed.

29
00:02:08,236 --> 00:02:10,063
Even a dense person
can become intelligent.

30
00:02:11,955 --> 00:02:12,955
That was respectable.

31
00:02:16,835 --> 00:02:18,436
What do you mean by that?

32
00:02:25,835 --> 00:02:26,835
Get me a cup of water.

33
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,990
(Qibo Medical Centre)

34
00:03:12,835 --> 00:03:13,835
Professor Ren,

35
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,876
if they do arrest me,

36
00:03:19,555 --> 00:03:21,716
can I entrust Jian Xi to you?

37
00:03:22,555 --> 00:03:23,913
In my life,

38
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:25,356
there's no Ding Jian Xi.

39
00:03:26,835 --> 00:03:27,876
She's your daughter.

40
00:03:32,716 --> 00:03:33,716
Okay.

41
00:03:34,555 --> 00:03:35,555
If so,

42
00:03:36,076 --> 00:03:37,636
I'll apologise to them.

43
00:03:38,475 --> 00:03:39,876
I'll kneel

44
00:03:39,996 --> 00:03:41,156
and kowtow to them.

45
00:03:41,996 --> 00:03:43,796
I'll give them all my money.

46
00:03:44,475 --> 00:03:46,562
I'm fine with anything
as long as they let me off

47
00:03:47,115 --> 00:03:48,755
and let me take care of Jian Xi.

48
00:03:50,115 --> 00:03:52,115
Why are you expecting them
to let you off?

49
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:56,716
Cheng Ying bumped into
your daughter, right?

50
00:03:58,356 --> 00:03:59,636
She's dead, right?

51
00:04:01,076 --> 00:04:02,195
What else can I do?

52
00:04:02,755 --> 00:04:04,193
You're giving them all of your money?

53
00:04:04,276 --> 00:04:06,016
How will you save your daughter by then?

54
00:04:08,555 --> 00:04:09,555
As long as

55
00:04:10,636 --> 00:04:11,636
she's alive,

56
00:04:12,276 --> 00:04:15,475
I'll find a way to save her
even if it means that I have to sell

57
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:17,636
my house, even my kidneys.

58
00:04:26,076 --> 00:04:27,636
Don't do that. Please get up.

59
00:04:30,755 --> 00:04:31,755
Professor Ren,

60
00:04:33,195 --> 00:04:34,369
you're a benevolent person.

61
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:36,525
You have a benevolent mind and heart.

62
00:04:37,356 --> 00:04:39,116
Can you take me and my daughter in?

63
00:04:39,836 --> 00:04:40,995
I can do anything.

64
00:04:42,195 --> 00:04:43,796
I was once an accountant.

65
00:04:44,195 --> 00:04:45,556
I can work as an admin.

66
00:04:46,195 --> 00:04:48,715
I can even be your janitor.

67
00:04:49,636 --> 00:04:51,475
I'll do anything you ask me to do

68
00:04:52,076 --> 00:04:53,859
as long as you take me
and my daughter in.

69
00:04:54,435 --> 00:04:56,916
You'll be imprisoned soon.

70
00:04:58,116 --> 00:04:59,995
How could you work here?

71
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,433
Do you have any relatives?

72
00:05:04,516 --> 00:05:06,038
If you do, you should contact them.

73
00:05:06,995 --> 00:05:08,836
How will I deal with your daughter

74
00:05:09,116 --> 00:05:10,995
after the cops arrest you?

75
00:05:17,435 --> 00:05:18,916
Hurry and make your decision.

76
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:21,396
What should I do?

77
00:05:38,836 --> 00:05:41,836
I'll be imprisoned soon!

78
00:05:42,556 --> 00:05:44,155
If I die now,

79
00:05:45,435 --> 00:05:48,715
I have no one to entrust my daughter to!

80
00:06:13,595 --> 00:06:14,956
Cheng Ying isn't dead.

81
00:06:19,116 --> 00:06:20,232
Get up.

82
00:06:20,315 --> 00:06:21,112
She's not dead?

83
00:06:21,195 --> 00:06:22,195
She's not dead.

84
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:23,446
I checked on her just now.

85
00:06:23,636 --> 00:06:24,632
She's alive.

86
00:06:24,715 --> 00:06:26,157
It's just that she's seriously ill.

87
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:26,993
She's not dead.

88
00:06:27,076 --> 00:06:28,072
Really?

89
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:29,155
Really.

90
00:06:29,435 --> 00:06:30,233
I get to decide whether she dies or not

91
00:06:30,316 --> 00:06:31,916
when I'm around.

92
00:06:32,755 --> 00:06:33,755
Professor Ren,

93
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:35,956
I'm begging you.

94
00:06:36,315 --> 00:06:38,475
Please save her

95
00:06:38,595 --> 00:06:40,035
on the account of my daughter.

96
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,392
Alright.

97
00:06:41,475 --> 00:06:42,556
Get up.

98
00:06:42,755 --> 00:06:43,792
Come.

99
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:44,875
Be careful.

100
00:06:46,275 --> 00:06:47,275
Have some water.

101
00:06:52,836 --> 00:06:53,836
Be careful.

102
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:58,875
Do you still hate her?

103
00:06:59,995 --> 00:07:02,556
You felt pure joy after
experiencing pure sadness.

104
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:03,916
How do you feel?

105
00:07:12,356 --> 00:07:13,443
Let me ask you something.

106
00:07:14,595 --> 00:07:15,952
Did you ever think about

107
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:17,352
joining your husband

108
00:07:17,435 --> 00:07:18,827
when he departed from the world?

109
00:07:21,035 --> 00:07:22,315
When one is dead,

110
00:07:23,035 --> 00:07:24,595
nothing will be left.

111
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:26,595
Your source of hatred and grudge

112
00:07:26,995 --> 00:07:28,232
will be gone.

113
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:30,011
What if you departed together with him?

114
00:07:30,595 --> 00:07:31,875
What will Jian Xi do then?

115
00:07:35,315 --> 00:07:37,435
Alright. You've already gotten through

116
00:07:37,556 --> 00:07:39,755
the worst moment in your life.

117
00:07:40,356 --> 00:07:41,356
Anger

118
00:07:42,035 --> 00:07:43,556
makes slaves of people.

119
00:07:45,035 --> 00:07:46,715
When you get angry,

120
00:07:47,035 --> 00:07:50,035
you'll become your own slave.

121
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:54,315
We forgive people

122
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:55,912
to face

123
00:07:55,995 --> 00:07:57,875
our conscience.

124
00:07:59,556 --> 00:08:01,315
It's not like you've lost everything.

125
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,475
You still have Jian Xi,

126
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
right?

127
00:08:10,595 --> 00:08:12,155
Have you found your tile?

128
00:08:14,595 --> 00:08:16,153
Look at you. You have been
spending all your energy

129
00:08:16,236 --> 00:08:18,912
on trying to sue people, demanding money

130
00:08:18,995 --> 00:08:19,995
and cursing them out.

131
00:08:20,195 --> 00:08:21,475
What will Jian Xi do then?

132
00:08:25,556 --> 00:08:26,672
I'll look for it.

133
00:08:26,755 --> 00:08:28,595
I must save Jian Xi.

134
00:08:29,155 --> 00:08:31,475
That's why you should spend your energy

135
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:33,916
on the things that matter.

136
00:08:35,676 --> 00:08:37,236
When you were angry,

137
00:08:37,356 --> 00:08:39,595
you forgot that Jian Xi was by your side.

138
00:08:41,316 --> 00:08:43,192
What if Li Quan didn't save her?

139
00:08:43,275 --> 00:08:44,835
What if the wheelchair fell?

140
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,116
Have you ever thought of
the consequences?

141
00:08:50,116 --> 00:08:52,835
Forgiving people means
forgiving yourself.

142
00:08:53,876 --> 00:08:55,316
You have to let go.

143
00:08:58,595 --> 00:08:59,595
You must be starving.

144
00:09:00,595 --> 00:09:01,955
Jian Xi hasn't eaten yet.

145
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,760
Yeah.

146
00:09:04,996 --> 00:09:06,635
Jian Xi hasn't eaten yet.

147
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,916
"Aiding with the Best Medicine"

148
00:09:55,756 --> 00:09:56,756
Mr Ren.

149
00:10:01,196 --> 00:10:02,196
Something's up?

150
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,920
Yes.

151
00:10:04,436 --> 00:10:06,075
I hope you can do me a favour.

152
00:10:07,556 --> 00:10:08,991
Thank you for what you did today.

153
00:10:10,436 --> 00:10:11,436
It was my job.

154
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:13,236
What is it? Tell me.

155
00:10:15,876 --> 00:10:16,674
My parents want

156
00:10:16,757 --> 00:10:19,316
to celebrate the Dragon Boat Festival
here with me.

157
00:10:20,196 --> 00:10:22,196
Before this, I told them that...

158
00:10:24,316 --> 00:10:25,913
Stop hesitating.

159
00:10:25,996 --> 00:10:26,996
Speak up.

160
00:10:27,756 --> 00:10:28,674
Before this, I told them

161
00:10:28,757 --> 00:10:29,996
that I already found a job.

162
00:10:31,515 --> 00:10:32,515
So,

163
00:10:32,876 --> 00:10:34,572
can you tell them that I'm working here

164
00:10:34,876 --> 00:10:36,236
if you see them?

165
00:10:37,756 --> 00:10:39,278
Can you tell them I'm a staff here?

166
00:10:39,475 --> 00:10:42,215
Why would our medical centre
even hire staff in the first place?

167
00:10:42,796 --> 00:10:43,970
I know that's not the case.

168
00:10:46,515 --> 00:10:48,116
But can you tell them that?

169
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,996
You want me to lie to them?

170
00:10:54,075 --> 00:10:55,033
Listen.

171
00:10:55,116 --> 00:10:56,436
I never lie.

172
00:10:56,635 --> 00:10:58,635
And, I will never lie for your sake.

173
00:11:00,196 --> 00:11:01,793
Once you lie, you need to lie ten times

174
00:11:01,876 --> 00:11:03,556
to cover up your first lie.

175
00:11:03,756 --> 00:11:05,316
If you wish to obtain something,

176
00:11:05,635 --> 00:11:07,153
you must strive to obtain it.

177
00:11:07,236 --> 00:11:08,367
Do not rely on expediency.

178
00:11:09,196 --> 00:11:10,196
Understood?

179
00:11:44,635 --> 00:11:46,353
Sorry for being late.

180
00:11:46,436 --> 00:11:48,176
I couldn't recognise you in this outfit.

181
00:11:48,515 --> 00:11:50,236
What kind of outfit is this?

182
00:11:51,395 --> 00:11:53,135
I don't like the smell of kitchen fumes.

183
00:11:53,556 --> 00:11:54,916
Sorry then, Ms Yang.

184
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:56,797
You haven't ordered any food yet, right?

185
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,633
Listen,

186
00:11:57,716 --> 00:11:58,996
the roasted kidneys here

187
00:11:59,116 --> 00:12:00,116
are amazing.

188
00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:03,913
I... I forgot.

189
00:12:03,996 --> 00:12:05,075
You're a vegetarian.

190
00:12:05,395 --> 00:12:07,033
Their roasted chives and mushrooms

191
00:12:07,116 --> 00:12:08,432
are great too.

192
00:12:08,515 --> 00:12:09,756
Don't order food for me.

193
00:12:10,515 --> 00:12:11,473
I waited until now

194
00:12:11,556 --> 00:12:13,275
to reject you directly.

195
00:12:13,436 --> 00:12:14,793
The tuition class between us

196
00:12:14,876 --> 00:12:15,714
is over.

197
00:12:15,797 --> 00:12:17,363
Okay? Let's go on our separate ways.

198
00:12:18,876 --> 00:12:19,876
What are you doing?

199
00:12:19,996 --> 00:12:20,992
Return my bag to me.

200
00:12:21,075 --> 00:12:22,312
You can keep this bag

201
00:12:22,395 --> 00:12:23,114
with me first.

202
00:12:23,197 --> 00:12:25,458
I'll return it to you once
the tuition class is over.

203
00:12:25,796 --> 00:12:26,996
-You!
-Madam!

204
00:12:28,116 --> 00:12:30,353
Give us ten roasted lamb skewers,

205
00:12:30,436 --> 00:12:31,713
ten roasted kidney skewers,

206
00:12:31,796 --> 00:12:34,275
one roasted mushroom skewer
and one roasted chives skewer.

207
00:12:34,756 --> 00:12:35,872
-Just like the usual.
-Alright.

208
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:36,913
Didn't I tell you already?

209
00:12:36,996 --> 00:12:38,233
I'm not eating.
Don't order anything for me.

210
00:12:38,316 --> 00:12:39,635
I don't take junk food.

211
00:12:39,876 --> 00:12:41,007
I ordered them for myself.

212
00:13:02,556 --> 00:13:03,556
Delicious.

213
00:13:05,556 --> 00:13:07,339
It's a shame that you're not trying them.

214
00:13:08,436 --> 00:13:09,793
Let me tell you this.

215
00:13:09,876 --> 00:13:11,793
I came here today

216
00:13:11,876 --> 00:13:13,992
because I thought it was closer
to your hospital.

217
00:13:14,075 --> 00:13:15,515
But it won't happen again.

218
00:13:16,116 --> 00:13:17,113
Yeah, yeah.

219
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:18,713
But according to
my limited life experience,

220
00:13:18,796 --> 00:13:19,793
only bars and roasted skewer stalls

221
00:13:19,876 --> 00:13:21,473
are still open at this hour.

222
00:13:21,556 --> 00:13:22,913
Bars are too loud.

223
00:13:22,996 --> 00:13:24,432
I don't think we can hold
our tuition class there.

224
00:13:24,515 --> 00:13:26,316
Can't you change it to another time then?

225
00:13:26,876 --> 00:13:28,113
I'm having tuition classes
during my night shifts

226
00:13:28,196 --> 00:13:30,805
so that I can head to the medical centre
during my rest days.

227
00:13:35,756 --> 00:13:36,756
Alright.

228
00:13:37,236 --> 00:13:38,236
Let's begin.

229
00:13:39,316 --> 00:13:40,473
You're taking

230
00:13:40,556 --> 00:13:42,992
something this oily and salty at night.

231
00:13:43,075 --> 00:13:45,236
Your lifestyle is so unhealthy.

232
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:48,473
Just finish your yogurt
and be done with your preaching.

233
00:13:48,556 --> 00:13:50,236
You're a doctor, you know?

234
00:13:51,436 --> 00:13:52,835
I study Western medicine.

235
00:13:54,116 --> 00:13:56,356
However, I'm giving you tuition
regarding TCM.

236
00:13:56,515 --> 00:13:58,473
TCM focuses on wellness.

237
00:13:58,556 --> 00:14:00,512
Focusing on one's wellness should be
prioritized above treating illnesses.

238
00:14:00,595 --> 00:14:01,552
So, according to your TCM theories,

239
00:14:01,635 --> 00:14:03,312
at this time, you should
leave your phone in the living room

240
00:14:03,395 --> 00:14:04,676
and lie on the bed, right?

241
00:14:05,955 --> 00:14:07,673
You're staying up to teach me about TCM.

242
00:14:07,756 --> 00:14:09,793
I can only repay you

243
00:14:09,876 --> 00:14:10,876
with such a method.

244
00:14:24,436 --> 00:14:25,436
For this chapter,

245
00:14:26,796 --> 00:14:28,552
we focus on

246
00:14:28,635 --> 00:14:30,312
the relationship between
one's nature, heart, and body.

247
00:14:30,395 --> 00:14:31,515
According to Mr Ren,

248
00:14:31,876 --> 00:14:34,635
even if we do retain our fitness,

249
00:14:34,996 --> 00:14:38,432
we're only 10% there.

250
00:14:38,515 --> 00:14:40,312
The other 40% comes from

251
00:14:40,395 --> 00:14:42,676
the health of one's mentality.

252
00:14:43,236 --> 00:14:46,835
And, the one leading our health
is the health of our nature.

253
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Look.

254
00:14:48,635 --> 00:14:49,796
I'm right, aren't I?

255
00:14:50,196 --> 00:14:52,233
TCM and Western medicine
are finally coming together.

256
00:14:52,316 --> 00:14:53,713
One's diet isn't important at all.

257
00:14:53,796 --> 00:14:56,579
If I do die early, it must be
due to a lack of sexual activities.

258
00:14:57,756 --> 00:14:59,322
That wasn't what I was referring to.

259
00:14:59,715 --> 00:15:00,793
It means disposition

260
00:15:00,876 --> 00:15:02,116
and spirituality.

261
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:05,876
It's an element that's above one's heart.

262
00:15:06,436 --> 00:15:07,715
It's the inner core of life.

263
00:15:08,196 --> 00:15:09,673
According to
Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic,

264
00:15:09,756 --> 00:15:11,432
somatic and spiritual harmony
are of utmost importance.

265
00:15:11,515 --> 00:15:12,876
A healthy body

266
00:15:13,236 --> 00:15:15,395
requires a fit physical body

267
00:15:15,556 --> 00:15:18,436
and a healthy state of mind.

268
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,075
We should be tranquil

269
00:15:20,796 --> 00:15:21,835
and have a sound mind.

270
00:15:22,996 --> 00:15:25,436
That's what I meant by nature.

271
00:15:25,996 --> 00:15:27,692
Our teacher said this during our class.

272
00:15:27,796 --> 00:15:30,916
Language represents
the evolution of thoughts.

273
00:15:31,196 --> 00:15:32,916
What were you thinking about?

274
00:15:33,236 --> 00:15:34,802
I'm just here to give you a tuition.

275
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:37,766
Fine. Seems like you're done
with studying anyway.

276
00:15:37,955 --> 00:15:39,395
-It's over.
-You're angry now?

277
00:15:40,275 --> 00:15:41,275
You're a lawyer, right?

278
00:15:41,595 --> 00:15:42,715
You're studying TCM too.

279
00:15:42,955 --> 00:15:46,035
Being emotional is detrimental to us.

280
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:48,312
You cannot be emotional
when you're in the court.

281
00:15:48,395 --> 00:15:49,913
When it comes to studying TCM,

282
00:15:49,996 --> 00:15:52,833
we need to be indifferent
when we're happy, angry, sad, or joyful.

283
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:54,482
Only then, we can retain our hearts.

284
00:15:54,715 --> 00:15:56,455
What do you think? I did do my homework.

285
00:15:56,876 --> 00:15:57,876
I'm not angry.

286
00:15:59,035 --> 00:16:01,166
I just want to head back
and take my beauty sleep.

287
00:16:01,955 --> 00:16:02,955
Alright.

288
00:16:03,075 --> 00:16:05,035
I apologise to you sincerely.

289
00:16:06,595 --> 00:16:08,752
You're both a great teacher
and a great student.

290
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:10,192
It was tough for you to teach me.

291
00:16:10,275 --> 00:16:11,275
I'm sorry.

292
00:16:12,515 --> 00:16:13,676
I'm not a good student.

293
00:16:14,635 --> 00:16:17,316
If I were one, I wouldn't
need to study TCM.

294
00:16:18,715 --> 00:16:19,715
But why?

295
00:16:21,395 --> 00:16:23,475
I learned many things in the past.

296
00:16:24,155 --> 00:16:25,436
I excelled in all of them.

297
00:16:25,916 --> 00:16:27,715
But even now, I still don't understand

298
00:16:28,035 --> 00:16:29,116
the meaning of life.

299
00:16:30,395 --> 00:16:32,876
In the past, I strove to improve myself

300
00:16:33,595 --> 00:16:35,155
to make my mother happy.

301
00:16:35,916 --> 00:16:37,090
I worked hard to make money

302
00:16:38,075 --> 00:16:39,510
so that I could sustain her life.

303
00:16:41,035 --> 00:16:42,395
But after her passing,

304
00:16:42,796 --> 00:16:44,116
I suddenly realised

305
00:16:46,316 --> 00:16:48,155
that making money and improving myself

306
00:16:48,436 --> 00:16:49,756
were pointless.

307
00:16:52,876 --> 00:16:53,876
Do you know something?

308
00:16:54,116 --> 00:16:54,873
Some time ago,

309
00:16:54,956 --> 00:16:56,033
the opposing lawyer of a lawsuit

310
00:16:56,116 --> 00:16:57,756
fell unconscious in front of me.

311
00:16:57,996 --> 00:16:59,155
He died just like that.

312
00:16:59,996 --> 00:17:02,233
After that, I thought about
all the law articles I learned.

313
00:17:02,316 --> 00:17:04,056
Why did I learn them in the first place?

314
00:17:06,536 --> 00:17:07,676
Mr Ren was right.

315
00:17:08,956 --> 00:17:11,552
Even if you're knowledgeable,
that doesn't mean you're cultured.

316
00:17:11,635 --> 00:17:13,201
We transform people through culture.

317
00:17:13,556 --> 00:17:15,252
Forget about transforming other people.

318
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:18,596
I can't even transform myself.

319
00:17:20,995 --> 00:17:22,430
You're transforming me right now.

320
00:17:23,196 --> 00:17:24,436
I'm not that capable.

321
00:17:24,716 --> 00:17:25,594
You're a stubborn soul.

322
00:17:25,677 --> 00:17:27,851
You're taking junk food
in the middle of the night.

323
00:17:29,196 --> 00:17:30,196
I have a good nature.

324
00:17:30,316 --> 00:17:31,114
I'm broad-minded.

325
00:17:31,197 --> 00:17:32,552
I don't take things too seriously.

326
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:34,395
That's the root of good health.

327
00:17:38,235 --> 00:17:39,476
Broad-minded, huh?

328
00:17:39,755 --> 00:17:41,929
Explain why you came
to cause trouble for our class

329
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,654
and got into a fight
with a patient's family member.

330
00:17:46,115 --> 00:17:47,593
Why do you know all of my secrets?

331
00:17:47,676 --> 00:17:49,395
How did you know that I was a spy?

332
00:17:49,956 --> 00:17:51,395
It wasn't a secret at all.

333
00:17:52,115 --> 00:17:54,515
Mr Ren knew it from
the day you joined us.

334
00:17:55,196 --> 00:17:56,713
You were scrolling your phone
during class.

335
00:17:56,796 --> 00:17:58,152
And, you kept causing arguments.

336
00:17:58,235 --> 00:17:59,353
I'll be honest with you.

337
00:17:59,436 --> 00:18:00,313
I only came here to give you tuition

338
00:18:00,396 --> 00:18:01,792
because of Mr Ren.

339
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:03,196
If not, do you think

340
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:05,515
I'll waste my time with you here?

341
00:18:05,755 --> 00:18:06,956
Mr Ren knew about it?

342
00:18:07,076 --> 00:18:07,913
Of course.

343
00:18:07,996 --> 00:18:09,649
If so, why did he still send you here?

344
00:18:10,515 --> 00:18:11,716
Mr Ren

345
00:18:12,115 --> 00:18:14,275
has placed himself and his lesson

346
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:16,875
on a microscope for you to see.

347
00:18:18,035 --> 00:18:20,275
Western medicine focuses on
the patient's illness

348
00:18:20,436 --> 00:18:22,275
while TCM focuses on the sick person.

349
00:18:23,275 --> 00:18:24,353
You can cause an argument

350
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:25,828
and create trouble all you want.

351
00:18:26,115 --> 00:18:27,072
But Mr Ren intends

352
00:18:27,155 --> 00:18:29,515
to cure you of your rowdy nature.

353
00:18:41,395 --> 00:18:42,395
Madam,

354
00:18:42,676 --> 00:18:44,068
get me another bottle of yogurt.

355
00:18:44,155 --> 00:18:45,875
-Okay.
-Get me a sugar-free yogurt.

356
00:18:46,676 --> 00:18:47,676
Coming.

357
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:20,656
What are you doing here?
Did you tail me?

358
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:25,792
You...

359
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,515
You know how to ride skateboards?

360
00:20:28,035 --> 00:20:29,395
I know plenty of things.

361
00:20:29,796 --> 00:20:30,796
Ren Tian Zhen.

362
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:34,875
This is pretty cool.

363
00:20:35,556 --> 00:20:36,995
I want to learn this too.

364
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:41,037
You want to learn
how to ride skateboards?

365
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:41,912
Yeah.

366
00:20:41,995 --> 00:20:43,235
-Really?
-Yeah.

367
00:20:43,556 --> 00:20:45,078
But I don't feel like teaching you.

368
00:20:48,196 --> 00:20:49,556
If you don't teach me,

369
00:20:51,035 --> 00:20:52,395
I'll tell your parents

370
00:20:53,035 --> 00:20:54,235
and grandparents

371
00:20:54,556 --> 00:20:56,792
that you're playing with something
as dangerous as this.

372
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:57,672
It's very dangerous.

373
00:20:57,755 --> 00:20:59,072
It's lethal and dangerous.

374
00:20:59,155 --> 00:21:00,286
I'll tell them right away.

375
00:21:00,556 --> 00:21:01,473
Are you a primary school student?

376
00:21:01,556 --> 00:21:03,339
You want to complain to your teacher now?

377
00:21:06,676 --> 00:21:08,894
Go ahead then. You'll be exposed
for joining me too.

378
00:21:09,115 --> 00:21:09,952
That's fine.

379
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:11,713
I'm parent less anyway.

380
00:21:11,796 --> 00:21:13,072
No one is keeping me in check.

381
00:21:13,155 --> 00:21:14,721
But it's different for someone else.

382
00:21:15,035 --> 00:21:17,355
You're their beloved baby.

383
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:19,032
Your grandparents will surely nag you

384
00:21:19,115 --> 00:21:20,192
after they find out.

385
00:21:20,275 --> 00:21:21,952
You have to stand there
and endure their nagging

386
00:21:22,035 --> 00:21:23,473
without talking back.

387
00:21:23,556 --> 00:21:24,713
If Meng Meng sees that,

388
00:21:24,796 --> 00:21:26,113
-Stop!
-as a man...

389
00:21:26,196 --> 00:21:27,192
Stop.

390
00:21:27,275 --> 00:21:28,275
I'll teach you.

391
00:21:29,395 --> 00:21:30,395
But you have to swear.

392
00:21:31,155 --> 00:21:32,556
Only you and I know about this.

393
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,672
Never tell a single soul about this.

394
00:21:34,755 --> 00:21:36,952
I swear I'll never tell a single soul.

395
00:21:37,035 --> 00:21:38,476
If you break your promise,

396
00:21:38,635 --> 00:21:40,755
may you starve for the rest of your life.

397
00:21:44,995 --> 00:21:45,995
That's pretty brutal.

398
00:21:46,676 --> 00:21:48,395
I promise. When will you teach me?

399
00:21:49,836 --> 00:21:51,432
Meng Meng's medicine is ready, right?

400
00:21:51,515 --> 00:21:52,515
What medicine?

401
00:21:55,796 --> 00:21:56,796
Oh no!

402
00:21:58,316 --> 00:21:59,664
Remember to teach me next time!

403
00:22:04,796 --> 00:22:05,796
Thank you.

404
00:22:05,995 --> 00:22:06,995
Don't mention it.

405
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,192
Hello, Madam.

406
00:22:09,275 --> 00:22:10,395
-Hello.
-Madam,

407
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,280
I'm here to pick up my parcel.

408
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:12,672
I'm Xiao Ming from Dorm 312.

409
00:22:12,755 --> 00:22:13,796
312, Xiao Ming.

410
00:22:15,755 --> 00:22:16,952
312, Xiao Ming.

411
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:18,035
Here.

412
00:22:19,556 --> 00:22:21,035
-Thank you, Madam.
-You're welcome.

413
00:22:23,035 --> 00:22:23,912
Hello, Madam.

414
00:22:23,995 --> 00:22:24,995
Hello.

415
00:22:40,556 --> 00:22:41,556
What's the matter?

416
00:22:42,155 --> 00:22:43,155
I guess

417
00:22:43,316 --> 00:22:44,237
we have another power outage.

418
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,100
What's going on?

419
00:22:45,183 --> 00:22:45,994
What's going on?

420
00:22:46,077 --> 00:22:47,316
The power tripped again?

421
00:22:48,995 --> 00:22:50,256
We have another power outage?

422
00:22:50,436 --> 00:22:51,436
Sorry about that.

423
00:22:52,115 --> 00:22:52,994
Open the door!

424
00:22:53,077 --> 00:22:54,355
Hide! Hurry up!

425
00:22:54,676 --> 00:22:55,937
Why did the power trip again?

426
00:22:56,035 --> 00:22:57,035
Coming.

427
00:22:59,556 --> 00:23:00,556
Coming.

428
00:23:02,796 --> 00:23:05,231
You must've used something
that you were not supposed to.

429
00:23:08,035 --> 00:23:08,952
I knew it.

430
00:23:09,035 --> 00:23:11,035
Didn't I say that you couldn't
bring this here?

431
00:23:12,916 --> 00:23:14,192
You were actually cooking dumplings here?

432
00:23:14,275 --> 00:23:15,836
Sorry, Madam. I was starving.

433
00:23:16,115 --> 00:23:17,115
I won't do it again.

434
00:23:17,635 --> 00:23:18,833
I'll never do it again.

435
00:23:18,916 --> 00:23:20,596
-Okay?
-How many times have I told you?

436
00:23:20,956 --> 00:23:21,956
Yes, Madam.

437
00:23:29,316 --> 00:23:30,316
Who are you?

438
00:23:30,755 --> 00:23:31,799
What are you doing here?

439
00:23:36,235 --> 00:23:37,235
Madam.

440
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,017
(Qibo Medical Centre)

441
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,100
You were chased out?

442
00:23:43,275 --> 00:23:44,353
Where are you staying then?

443
00:23:44,436 --> 00:23:46,235
I found a cheap place online.

444
00:23:46,796 --> 00:23:48,672
One day costs around 30 to 40 yuan.

445
00:23:48,755 --> 00:23:49,886
Can you take a bath there?

446
00:23:50,676 --> 00:23:51,912
Take a bath?

447
00:23:51,995 --> 00:23:53,778
I'm lucky enough to find a place to stay.

448
00:23:55,556 --> 00:23:58,209
It's easy for you to make remarks
when you're on the sideline.

449
00:24:01,316 --> 00:24:02,447
I'll find a place for you.

450
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:07,952
See?

451
00:24:08,035 --> 00:24:10,644
When you want to sleep, just bring
this bed to the storeroom.

452
00:24:11,916 --> 00:24:12,916
This is inappropriate.

453
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:14,596
What's inappropriate about it?

454
00:24:14,916 --> 00:24:16,830
I'll be here for you
if you get into trouble.

455
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:18,635
Besides, you're truly stubborn.

456
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:21,395
If I were you, I would try to be
a medical assistant here

457
00:24:21,556 --> 00:24:23,233
and survive first.

458
00:24:23,316 --> 00:24:24,515
You and I are different.

459
00:24:27,035 --> 00:24:29,353
Say, if I do work in this medical centre

460
00:24:29,436 --> 00:24:30,792
like my other seniors,

461
00:24:30,875 --> 00:24:33,441
even if I do get my own
consultation office after ten years,

462
00:24:34,316 --> 00:24:36,534
do you think people will
seek my service after that?

463
00:24:36,635 --> 00:24:37,713
In this industry,

464
00:24:37,796 --> 00:24:39,676
value comes with age.

465
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:41,432
You're different.

466
00:24:41,515 --> 00:24:43,155
You had a silver-spoon upbringing.

467
00:24:43,796 --> 00:24:45,353
You grew up in an esteemed family.

468
00:24:45,436 --> 00:24:46,393
No matter which mentor you get,

469
00:24:46,476 --> 00:24:47,875
they're the cream of the crop.

470
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:48,833
But me?

471
00:24:48,916 --> 00:24:50,264
I can only say this for myself.

472
00:24:51,155 --> 00:24:52,995
If one of the mentors
takes a liking to me,

473
00:24:53,115 --> 00:24:54,593
and if I learn under him,

474
00:24:54,676 --> 00:24:56,916
maybe I can be independent
after five years.

475
00:24:57,275 --> 00:24:58,275
Tell me then.

476
00:24:59,436 --> 00:25:01,316
What will I do

477
00:25:01,556 --> 00:25:03,296
if I don't depend on the medical centre?

478
00:25:03,796 --> 00:25:06,115
Free opportunities for people
to learn under a mentor

479
00:25:06,395 --> 00:25:08,275
were created for people like me,
you know?

480
00:25:14,436 --> 00:25:16,072
These are the keys to the medical centre.

481
00:25:16,155 --> 00:25:17,155
Just remember

482
00:25:17,316 --> 00:25:18,713
to bring the bed back and hide it here

483
00:25:18,796 --> 00:25:20,836
before work hours.

484
00:25:22,155 --> 00:25:23,155
Got it.

485
00:25:25,196 --> 00:25:26,457
You don't intend to thank me?

486
00:25:27,316 --> 00:25:28,312
Thank you so much.

487
00:25:28,395 --> 00:25:29,395
You're too courteous.

488
00:25:33,875 --> 00:25:35,571
Why did you transfer money to me again?

489
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:37,792
I made some pocket money
when I joined Grandpa

490
00:25:37,875 --> 00:25:38,793
in his consultations.

491
00:25:38,876 --> 00:25:41,032
Of course I need to share
good things with my buddy.

492
00:25:41,115 --> 00:25:42,713
Your grandfather actually
split the money with you?

493
00:25:42,796 --> 00:25:44,395
Nope. It's all mine.

494
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:45,875
We had a promise.

495
00:25:46,115 --> 00:25:47,233
He'll work for me as long as

496
00:25:47,316 --> 00:25:49,230
I'm willing to join him
in his consultations.

497
00:25:49,796 --> 00:25:51,113
If so, I won't stand on ceremony then.

498
00:25:51,196 --> 00:25:52,805
There's no need to stand on ceremony.

499
00:25:58,556 --> 00:25:59,556
Mr Ren.

500
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:04,613
What are you two doing here?

501
00:26:07,155 --> 00:26:08,460
We're here on cleaning duties.

502
00:26:14,916 --> 00:26:17,395
So, you don't need tools for that?

503
00:26:20,676 --> 00:26:21,716
We'll get them at once.

504
00:26:24,035 --> 00:26:25,316
-Mr Wu.
-Mr Wu.

505
00:26:25,515 --> 00:26:26,515
Kid.

506
00:26:27,515 --> 00:26:28,432
How did it go?

507
00:26:28,515 --> 00:26:29,792
You must've received
the invitation by now.

508
00:26:29,875 --> 00:26:30,919
I received it yesterday.

509
00:26:31,676 --> 00:26:34,395
Fellow Zhang will be
the honorary chairman this year.

510
00:26:34,916 --> 00:26:37,155
You will be our main speaker.

511
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:39,353
I still want Huang Wei to be our speaker.

512
00:26:39,436 --> 00:26:41,523
You should give
the younger generations a chance.

513
00:26:42,635 --> 00:26:45,035
Which student do you intend
to bring with you?

514
00:26:45,316 --> 00:26:47,716
Tian Zhen, Li Quan,

515
00:26:48,076 --> 00:26:49,076
and Sun Tou Tou.

516
00:26:50,515 --> 00:26:51,556
Sun Tou Tou?

517
00:26:52,035 --> 00:26:52,952
Do you think someone will take her in?

518
00:26:53,035 --> 00:26:54,635
Were you referring to Sun Tou Tou?

519
00:26:55,796 --> 00:26:56,539
Sun Tou Tou

520
00:26:56,622 --> 00:26:59,600
is the successor of the Jiang family's
acupuncture sect after all.

521
00:27:00,635 --> 00:27:02,395
She already assumed her position.

522
00:27:03,275 --> 00:27:05,395
She has to go there no matter what.

523
00:27:06,796 --> 00:27:10,316
I'm just worried that she might
bring disgrace to TCM Acupuncture.

524
00:27:10,676 --> 00:27:12,956
This is TCM Acupuncture's
first appearance.

525
00:27:13,676 --> 00:27:15,432
Just look at her primitive behaviour.

526
00:27:15,515 --> 00:27:17,552
What do you think people
will say about you

527
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:19,395
and TCM Acupuncture?

528
00:27:20,155 --> 00:27:22,155
That's their business.

529
00:27:22,676 --> 00:27:24,796
It's her business whether she can become

530
00:27:24,956 --> 00:27:26,087
a worthy successor or not.

531
00:27:26,196 --> 00:27:27,395
It's my business

532
00:27:27,596 --> 00:27:29,031
whether I bring her there or not.

533
00:27:29,115 --> 00:27:31,155
We all have our parts to do.

534
00:27:32,875 --> 00:27:34,310
You're making it too simple here.

535
00:27:34,635 --> 00:27:37,549
You can afford to take it lightly
since you don't have any position.

536
00:27:37,796 --> 00:27:39,432
Now, I'm attending the forum

537
00:27:39,515 --> 00:27:40,755
as the academy's principal.

538
00:27:41,275 --> 00:27:42,275
But you?

539
00:27:42,515 --> 00:27:43,907
You're trying to link my academy

540
00:27:44,035 --> 00:27:45,633
with your so-called students,

541
00:27:45,716 --> 00:27:46,594
which have complicated backgrounds.

542
00:27:46,677 --> 00:27:49,417
What do you think people will say
about our industry as a whole?

543
00:27:49,556 --> 00:27:50,861
Besides, you shouldn't forget.

544
00:27:51,436 --> 00:27:53,995
I'm holding on to this position
for your sake.

545
00:27:54,395 --> 00:27:56,596
You have to consider my feelings.

546
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,355
That's your business.

547
00:27:59,556 --> 00:28:00,556
But...

548
00:28:01,035 --> 00:28:03,949
I'm sure it's everyone's business
to maintain our reputation, right?

549
00:28:04,515 --> 00:28:05,515
Reputation, huh?

550
00:28:11,515 --> 00:28:12,473
Meng Meng,

551
00:28:12,556 --> 00:28:13,556
sesame seeds

552
00:28:13,676 --> 00:28:16,894
are good for injuries and deficiencies.
It also nourishes the five viscera.

553
00:28:21,155 --> 00:28:22,155
Try it.

554
00:28:25,275 --> 00:28:26,275
It's nice, right?

555
00:28:29,155 --> 00:28:31,235
This is for Wu Jun.

556
00:28:32,436 --> 00:28:33,836
He has to get twice the dosage.

557
00:28:36,316 --> 00:28:37,676
Ms Xia?

558
00:28:39,916 --> 00:28:40,916
So,

559
00:28:41,115 --> 00:28:42,952
Jian Xi's follow-up visit

560
00:28:43,035 --> 00:28:43,834
is in two days, right?

561
00:28:43,917 --> 00:28:45,596
What are you guys doing here today?

562
00:28:45,995 --> 00:28:47,312
Not only will we come today,

563
00:28:47,395 --> 00:28:49,196
but we'll also come here every day.

564
00:28:50,515 --> 00:28:51,552
What do you mean?

565
00:28:51,635 --> 00:28:53,115
Ms Xia, listen.

566
00:28:53,395 --> 00:28:55,873
Sometimes, you need to let go.

567
00:28:55,956 --> 00:28:57,312
Calm down.

568
00:28:57,395 --> 00:28:58,796
I'm not here to stir up trouble.

569
00:28:59,115 --> 00:29:00,316
I'm here to help.

570
00:29:00,916 --> 00:29:02,596
I told Professor Ren

571
00:29:02,755 --> 00:29:04,072
that I worked as an accountant before.

572
00:29:04,155 --> 00:29:05,196
From today onward,

573
00:29:05,316 --> 00:29:07,556
I will work as a volunteer here.

574
00:29:07,875 --> 00:29:09,136
Today's my first day of work.

575
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,473
Really?

576
00:29:11,556 --> 00:29:12,713
I never heard about that.

577
00:29:12,796 --> 00:29:14,875
Weren't you here too back then?

578
00:29:15,875 --> 00:29:17,713
If so, have you stopped
looking for the tiles?

579
00:29:17,796 --> 00:29:18,672
Of course not.

580
00:29:18,755 --> 00:29:20,233
I've already hired someone
to inquire about them for me.

581
00:29:20,316 --> 00:29:22,072
I'll depart immediately
once I receive any news.

582
00:29:22,155 --> 00:29:23,796
By then, I will leave Jian Xi...

583
00:29:24,196 --> 00:29:25,676
-No problem.
-Meng Meng.

584
00:29:27,796 --> 00:29:28,796
Meng Meng.

585
00:29:29,796 --> 00:29:30,796
Meng Meng.

586
00:29:31,796 --> 00:29:32,995
It'll be fine. Go now.

587
00:29:33,676 --> 00:29:34,637
Come here.

588
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,593
Meng Meng.

589
00:29:35,676 --> 00:29:36,916
Meng Meng, come here.

590
00:29:37,155 --> 00:29:38,875
I'm not here to fight today.

591
00:29:39,635 --> 00:29:41,713
I must've scared you guys back then.

592
00:29:41,796 --> 00:29:42,672
Not at all.

593
00:29:42,755 --> 00:29:43,755
Not at all.

594
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,619
Go now. It'll be fine.

595
00:29:45,702 --> 00:29:47,235
I'm not here to fight.

596
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:51,155
Everything's fine.

597
00:29:51,796 --> 00:29:52,713
Don't be scared.

598
00:29:52,796 --> 00:29:53,713
Zhu Xia, you're here?

599
00:29:53,796 --> 00:29:54,514
Dr Song.

600
00:29:54,597 --> 00:29:55,916
Who's afraid?

601
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,119
Listen.

602
00:29:58,202 --> 00:29:59,072
That's right.

603
00:29:59,155 --> 00:30:02,312
This ledger contains
this month's records.

604
00:30:02,395 --> 00:30:03,017
Take it.

605
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,032
Take a close look.

606
00:30:04,115 --> 00:30:05,393
Yes. Meng Meng loves to draw.

607
00:30:05,476 --> 00:30:07,032
Familiarize yourself with our accounts.

608
00:30:07,115 --> 00:30:08,676
I'll leave this to you then.

609
00:30:09,436 --> 00:30:11,263
Now that I'm here,
you don't need to worry.

610
00:30:14,436 --> 00:30:15,436
Jian Xi.

611
00:30:17,635 --> 00:30:18,635
Dr Song.

612
00:30:20,796 --> 00:30:21,796
Say,

613
00:30:21,916 --> 00:30:23,875
she did change a lot.

614
00:30:24,916 --> 00:30:25,916
This is amazing.

615
00:30:29,196 --> 00:30:30,501
Your master is amazing, right?

616
00:30:35,755 --> 00:30:36,796
He's pretty amazing.

617
00:30:38,916 --> 00:30:40,635
Meng Meng, that looked great.

618
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,657
(Plantable grains)

619
00:30:46,946 --> 00:30:49,359
(lose their effectiveness
after this season.)

620
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,545
(This solar term)

621
00:30:52,238 --> 00:30:55,845
(is the time when the South plants
grains and the North harvests wheat.)

622
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,499
(Grain in Ear)

623
00:31:10,596 --> 00:31:14,556
TCM is the manifestation of the term
"technique and integrity".

624
00:31:14,916 --> 00:31:18,076
However, without integrity, you can't
make it far with technique alone.

625
00:31:18,316 --> 00:31:20,099
Even if you have excellent
medical skills,

626
00:31:20,275 --> 00:31:21,928
without harmony between nature and men

627
00:31:23,035 --> 00:31:24,113
and a broad philosophical view,

628
00:31:24,196 --> 00:31:26,155
you won't be able to understand

629
00:31:27,155 --> 00:31:29,875
the meaning of "integrity"
when it comes to medical skills.

630
00:31:30,995 --> 00:31:34,192
That's the difference between
TCM and Western medicine.

631
00:31:34,275 --> 00:31:35,476
In my opinion,

632
00:31:36,556 --> 00:31:39,275
Western medicine will
develop into a detailed

633
00:31:40,035 --> 00:31:41,316
and meticulous field.

634
00:31:41,916 --> 00:31:43,035
As for TCM,

635
00:31:44,115 --> 00:31:47,676
it should develop in a broader direction.

636
00:31:48,676 --> 00:31:50,316
For our lesson today,

637
00:31:50,796 --> 00:31:51,796
we'll talk about

638
00:31:53,515 --> 00:31:56,155
the largest disharmony in humans.

639
00:31:59,676 --> 00:32:00,676
What is it?

640
00:32:03,676 --> 00:32:05,115
It's disharmony between humans.

641
00:32:07,755 --> 00:32:08,755
Everyone,

642
00:32:09,275 --> 00:32:11,312
do you know who's the star of

643
00:32:11,395 --> 00:32:12,633
our TCM industrial park?

644
00:32:12,716 --> 00:32:13,716
Who?

645
00:32:14,035 --> 00:32:15,035
It's Ren Xin Zheng.

646
00:32:16,395 --> 00:32:17,395
Professor Ren?

647
00:32:17,916 --> 00:32:19,113
He's pretty famous.

648
00:32:19,196 --> 00:32:20,556
What? Is he here?

649
00:32:20,995 --> 00:32:22,713
We are friends for many years.

650
00:32:22,796 --> 00:32:24,875
Now, he's hosting a class at my place.

651
00:32:25,676 --> 00:32:28,115
He's the representative figure
of our industrial park.

652
00:32:28,556 --> 00:32:29,596
He's hosting a class?

653
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:32,792
We plan to build

654
00:32:32,875 --> 00:32:34,155
a first-class national

655
00:32:34,676 --> 00:32:36,316
TCM talent training centre.

656
00:32:38,275 --> 00:32:40,032
Right now, the projects that
occupy most of your land here

657
00:32:40,115 --> 00:32:41,713
aren't in the direction
we're investing in.

658
00:32:41,796 --> 00:32:43,552
They lack Internet thinking.

659
00:32:43,635 --> 00:32:44,552
Besides,

660
00:32:44,635 --> 00:32:45,354
building a school

661
00:32:45,437 --> 00:32:47,432
was a great way to develop
one's land in the last century.

662
00:32:47,515 --> 00:32:48,556
But to put it bluntly,

663
00:32:48,995 --> 00:32:50,432
it'll take a long time

664
00:32:50,515 --> 00:32:51,994
before we can gain profit from it.

665
00:32:54,635 --> 00:32:56,395
Great minds think alike indeed.

666
00:32:57,035 --> 00:32:59,035
We're implementing Internet thinking.

667
00:32:59,676 --> 00:33:00,676
The class is free.

668
00:33:00,916 --> 00:33:01,834
We attract talents first.

669
00:33:01,917 --> 00:33:03,312
We've invited many renowned figures

670
00:33:03,395 --> 00:33:05,072
to teach here.

671
00:33:05,155 --> 00:33:06,596
Once news of this gets out,

672
00:33:07,035 --> 00:33:07,793
those who wish

673
00:33:07,876 --> 00:33:09,676
to join the TCM industry

674
00:33:09,916 --> 00:33:11,432
have to join us

675
00:33:11,515 --> 00:33:13,776
before they can establish
a foothold in the industry.

676
00:33:14,155 --> 00:33:15,875
We can brag about this shamelessly.

677
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,192
This is

678
00:33:17,275 --> 00:33:19,316
a business academy for TCM.

679
00:33:22,916 --> 00:33:24,032
Other business academies

680
00:33:24,115 --> 00:33:25,432
earn hundreds of thousands easily.

681
00:33:25,515 --> 00:33:27,072
But your academy is offering
classes for free.

682
00:33:27,155 --> 00:33:28,851
How could you compare yourself to them?

683
00:33:29,395 --> 00:33:30,716
When we're emotional,

684
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:32,952
when we have hatred in our hearts,

685
00:33:33,035 --> 00:33:35,340
when we're frustrated,
what do you think we should do?

686
00:33:35,916 --> 00:33:37,090
Do you think you'll be fine

687
00:33:37,796 --> 00:33:39,579
after getting surgery
and taking medicine?

688
00:33:40,395 --> 00:33:41,995
Obviously, that won't work.

689
00:33:43,275 --> 00:33:44,395
What should we do then?

690
00:33:45,875 --> 00:33:48,155
According to the Doctrine of the Mean,

691
00:33:48,836 --> 00:33:51,316
when joy, anger, sorrow,
and pleasure have not yet arisen,

692
00:33:51,556 --> 00:33:52,600
it is called "moderate".

693
00:33:55,556 --> 00:33:56,556
But guys,

694
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,912
we, humans, aren't

695
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,395
deities in temples.

696
00:34:00,676 --> 00:34:02,713
When we have anger,

697
00:34:02,796 --> 00:34:04,196
we must vent it out.

698
00:34:05,035 --> 00:34:06,818
Here comes the latter part of the saying.

699
00:34:07,035 --> 00:34:11,835
When they arise to their appropriate
levels, it is called "harmony".

700
00:34:12,996 --> 00:34:14,276
We already know

701
00:34:14,395 --> 00:34:16,795
that our emotions have deviated
from the central path.

702
00:34:17,395 --> 00:34:19,787
What should we do when it has
already harmed our bodies?

703
00:34:21,635 --> 00:34:23,115
There's still a way

704
00:34:23,635 --> 00:34:24,792
we can regulate our bodies.

705
00:34:24,875 --> 00:34:26,276
Next, we'll talk about

706
00:34:26,795 --> 00:34:29,795
how to regulate our unstable emotions.

707
00:34:31,516 --> 00:34:34,516
The Chinese culture relies on practice.

708
00:34:36,795 --> 00:34:37,882
Integrity needs practice.

709
00:34:39,795 --> 00:34:40,953
Morality needs to be instilled.

710
00:34:41,036 --> 00:34:44,276
If language does not transform one,

711
00:34:44,395 --> 00:34:46,115
there will be no culture.

712
00:34:48,395 --> 00:34:49,482
So, what do we transform?

713
00:34:50,155 --> 00:34:51,155
What do we transform?

714
00:34:53,315 --> 00:34:54,472
Guys, what do we transform?

715
00:34:54,555 --> 00:34:56,436
We transform our negative emotions.

716
00:34:57,075 --> 00:34:59,433
If someone has negative emotions,

717
00:34:59,516 --> 00:35:01,355
you must transform them
with your actions.

718
00:35:01,996 --> 00:35:04,436
Avoiding and procrastinating

719
00:35:04,996 --> 00:35:07,155
will harm your body severely.

720
00:35:12,676 --> 00:35:14,113
I think there's an issue

721
00:35:14,196 --> 00:35:15,114
with your mindset.

722
00:35:15,197 --> 00:35:16,795
I agree with Mr Liu.

723
00:35:17,236 --> 00:35:18,593
We have to attract traffic first.

724
00:35:18,676 --> 00:35:19,394
After that,

725
00:35:19,477 --> 00:35:21,347
you can continue
with the Internet thinking.

726
00:35:21,635 --> 00:35:23,722
We'll earn money from
the surrounding businesses.

727
00:35:24,476 --> 00:35:25,635
The trading of herbs,

728
00:35:27,555 --> 00:35:28,555
online prescriptions,

729
00:35:28,716 --> 00:35:31,996
and the recommendation
between TCM and Western medicine,

730
00:35:32,555 --> 00:35:34,916
all of these will make huge money.

731
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:37,756
The largest benefit of this academy

732
00:35:37,875 --> 00:35:38,792
is that

733
00:35:38,875 --> 00:35:41,595
it'll produce batches and batches
of new talents.

734
00:35:41,716 --> 00:35:42,716
That's right.

735
00:35:43,236 --> 00:35:44,353
This is a great concept.

736
00:35:44,436 --> 00:35:45,552
If we organise it,

737
00:35:45,635 --> 00:35:47,436
it'll be a complete proposal.

738
00:35:47,555 --> 00:35:49,516
The most valuable assets
in the TCM industry

739
00:35:49,756 --> 00:35:50,473
-are its people.
-That's right.

740
00:35:50,556 --> 00:35:51,996
As long as he's here,

741
00:35:52,155 --> 00:35:53,395
your industrial park

742
00:35:53,756 --> 00:35:54,673
will thrive.

743
00:35:54,756 --> 00:35:55,756
That's right.

744
00:35:58,516 --> 00:35:59,752
There's one more important point.

745
00:35:59,835 --> 00:36:01,673
We cannot talk about
the profit model first.

746
00:36:01,756 --> 00:36:02,996
Only small projects

747
00:36:03,115 --> 00:36:04,792
talk about their profit model
at the start.

748
00:36:04,875 --> 00:36:06,835
We have to talk about visions and dreams.

749
00:36:07,075 --> 00:36:07,874
Just like Elon Musk.

750
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:09,393
He talked about migrating to Mars
after he assumed his position.

751
00:36:09,476 --> 00:36:10,835
A world without borders.

752
00:36:11,236 --> 00:36:12,512
He made all those tycoons

753
00:36:12,595 --> 00:36:13,756
excited.

754
00:36:14,916 --> 00:36:16,113
When it comes to talking about dreams,

755
00:36:16,196 --> 00:36:17,631
Mr Liu, you're not the right fit.

756
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,552
Think about it.

757
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:19,633
When you stand here,

758
00:36:19,716 --> 00:36:21,232
people will definitely think

759
00:36:21,315 --> 00:36:22,837
that the culture of your enterprise

760
00:36:22,956 --> 00:36:24,272
only focuses on profit,

761
00:36:24,355 --> 00:36:25,516
not dreams.

762
00:36:27,516 --> 00:36:28,835
Professor Ren is a great fit.

763
00:36:29,236 --> 00:36:30,996
If he comes to talk about his dreams,

764
00:36:31,196 --> 00:36:32,956
everyone in the world will be convinced.

765
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,393
What about this?

766
00:36:36,476 --> 00:36:38,563
We have a peer advisory board meeting
next month.

767
00:36:38,716 --> 00:36:39,792
You can invite Professor Ren

768
00:36:39,875 --> 00:36:40,956
to tell us

769
00:36:41,155 --> 00:36:42,673
about the vision of TCM development.

770
00:36:42,756 --> 00:36:44,835
As for the rest, we'll package them.

771
00:36:45,709 --> 00:36:48,189
This feels especially out of place.

772
00:36:48,756 --> 00:36:49,756
It's decided then.

773
00:36:51,716 --> 00:36:52,716
Let's go.

774
00:37:07,555 --> 00:37:08,956
Hello, Professor Ren?

775
00:37:09,276 --> 00:37:11,276
Today was supposed to
be your follow-up visit.

776
00:37:11,795 --> 00:37:12,792
I'm already done with my class.

777
00:37:12,875 --> 00:37:14,093
Why haven't you arrived yet?

778
00:37:15,395 --> 00:37:16,756
Actually, I was there.

779
00:37:19,516 --> 00:37:20,908
(I was at the classroom's door.)

780
00:37:21,236 --> 00:37:23,075
(I heard your lesson about emotion.)

781
00:37:23,716 --> 00:37:25,355
(I was suddenly enlightened.)

782
00:37:26,196 --> 00:37:28,395
(It feels like all of my troubles
has been lifted.)

783
00:37:29,115 --> 00:37:30,756
I feel like I'm cured.

784
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,560
Congratulations then.

785
00:37:34,795 --> 00:37:35,916
Thank you, Professor Ren.

786
00:37:55,236 --> 00:37:56,236
Grandson!

787
00:37:57,676 --> 00:37:58,676
I'm here!

788
00:37:59,956 --> 00:38:00,956
Where's the skateboard?

789
00:38:02,476 --> 00:38:03,737
Wait, where's the skateboard?

790
00:38:05,956 --> 00:38:06,996
You brought nothing?

791
00:38:07,795 --> 00:38:09,395
What? Are we here to eat?

792
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,800
Today,

793
00:38:11,795 --> 00:38:13,752
you shall acknowledge me
as your master first.

794
00:38:17,635 --> 00:38:19,155
What's wrong with you guys?

795
00:38:19,956 --> 00:38:20,874
Why do you guys like

796
00:38:20,957 --> 00:38:22,236
such ceremonies so much?

797
00:38:23,236 --> 00:38:24,272
Do you like it that much

798
00:38:24,355 --> 00:38:25,673
when people address you as Master?

799
00:38:25,756 --> 00:38:26,756
You're so childish.

800
00:38:27,716 --> 00:38:28,873
If you wish to travel the pugilist world,

801
00:38:28,956 --> 00:38:30,875
you must get a famous master.

802
00:38:31,276 --> 00:38:33,113
Since I've already agreed to teach you,

803
00:38:33,196 --> 00:38:34,635
we need to make this official.

804
00:38:35,036 --> 00:38:36,276
If not, what if you...

805
00:38:36,555 --> 00:38:39,153
If I do embarrass myself out there,

806
00:38:39,236 --> 00:38:40,913
I won't rat you out, okay?

807
00:38:40,996 --> 00:38:41,996
Deal.

808
00:38:45,276 --> 00:38:46,276
Deal.

809
00:38:46,956 --> 00:38:47,956
Alright.

810
00:38:49,196 --> 00:38:50,196
You're so troublesome.

811
00:38:50,676 --> 00:38:51,394
What are you doing?

812
00:38:51,477 --> 00:38:53,304
We have to be particular
with the ceremony.

813
00:38:56,395 --> 00:38:57,395
Look.

814
00:38:57,676 --> 00:39:00,552
This is an excellent wine that
my grandfather has kept for a long time.

815
00:39:00,635 --> 00:39:01,956
It's definitely good.

816
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:05,075
What do you think?

817
00:39:05,956 --> 00:39:07,516
Don't you think I'm nice?

818
00:39:10,196 --> 00:39:11,633
I'm sure this has a huge kick then.

819
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:12,956
Of course.

820
00:39:14,996 --> 00:39:16,214
You can stop craving for it.

821
00:39:16,716 --> 00:39:17,716
Go ahead.

822
00:39:20,315 --> 00:39:21,315
Rebecca.

823
00:39:21,795 --> 00:39:22,633
Rebecca,

824
00:39:22,716 --> 00:39:24,232
I don't think it's appropriate

825
00:39:24,315 --> 00:39:25,312
for us to just drink yogurt

826
00:39:25,395 --> 00:39:26,743
without ordering any food here.

827
00:39:27,635 --> 00:39:29,113
Can you please focus?

828
00:39:29,196 --> 00:39:30,476
My time is expensive.

829
00:39:32,676 --> 00:39:34,032
You kept playing with those threads.

830
00:39:34,115 --> 00:39:35,756
How can I focus like this?

831
00:39:39,236 --> 00:39:40,236
I'm done.

832
00:39:42,036 --> 00:39:43,472
Does this shirt cost
tens of thousands as well

833
00:39:43,555 --> 00:39:44,642
when it looks this cheap?

834
00:39:46,676 --> 00:39:49,433
I ordered this from Taobao.

835
00:39:49,516 --> 00:39:51,193
It's meant for people
to wear to food stalls.

836
00:39:51,276 --> 00:39:52,433
It costs 55 yuan

837
00:39:52,516 --> 00:39:54,355
from top to bottom.
And, it's disposable.

838
00:39:54,476 --> 00:39:55,313
By the way,

839
00:39:55,396 --> 00:39:56,875
it's 80 yuan if you include

840
00:39:57,115 --> 00:39:58,312
this disposable bottle as well.

841
00:39:58,395 --> 00:39:59,916
What? You use Taobao too?

842
00:40:00,276 --> 00:40:02,016
I had no choice. You forced me to do it.

843
00:40:02,395 --> 00:40:03,436
That's pretty good.

844
00:40:03,555 --> 00:40:05,355
Share the link with me later.

845
00:40:08,436 --> 00:40:09,593
By the way, I have something to tell you.

846
00:40:09,676 --> 00:40:11,590
The Dragon Boat Festival
is a public holiday.

847
00:40:11,875 --> 00:40:13,552
Our tuition class

848
00:40:13,635 --> 00:40:14,673
will be suspended for the time being.

849
00:40:14,756 --> 00:40:15,756
But why?

850
00:40:16,075 --> 00:40:17,155
Are you going on a trip?

851
00:40:17,875 --> 00:40:19,916
I'm going to join the TCM forum.

852
00:40:20,276 --> 00:40:21,633
But your name wasn't included

853
00:40:21,716 --> 00:40:22,633
in the name list.

854
00:40:22,716 --> 00:40:24,232
Besides, people won't invite

855
00:40:24,315 --> 00:40:25,953
half-baked physicians like us.

856
00:40:26,036 --> 00:40:27,036
This time,

857
00:40:27,555 --> 00:40:30,196
I'm going there because
the organiser invited me.

858
00:40:30,716 --> 00:40:32,555
What gives?
Why didn't he invite me then?

859
00:40:32,916 --> 00:40:35,113
The organiser is an

860
00:40:35,196 --> 00:40:36,073
old client of mine.

861
00:40:36,156 --> 00:40:38,272
I'm going there to visit him mainly.

862
00:40:38,355 --> 00:40:40,660
I'm just joining the forum
since I'll be there anyway.

863
00:40:41,795 --> 00:40:44,196
I think you're just going there
to join the forum.

864
00:40:45,196 --> 00:40:46,196
Take me with you.

865
00:40:47,036 --> 00:40:48,312
A spy like me

866
00:40:48,395 --> 00:40:51,352
needs to head to the enemy's nest
to eradicate them once and for all.

867
00:40:52,196 --> 00:40:53,153
Take me with you.

868
00:40:53,236 --> 00:40:54,033
You're a renowned figure.

869
00:40:54,116 --> 00:40:55,769
You need to have a servant beside you.

870
00:40:56,395 --> 00:40:57,476
Besides,

871
00:40:57,956 --> 00:40:59,652
the mountain path is rugged and uneven.

872
00:41:00,196 --> 00:41:01,153
I checked the schedule too.

873
00:41:01,236 --> 00:41:01,953
We have to gather mugwort

874
00:41:02,036 --> 00:41:02,874
in the mountains before dawn
on the second day.

875
00:41:02,957 --> 00:41:04,312
I'm sure you'll depart at night.

876
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:05,673
What if you encounter a bear

877
00:41:05,756 --> 00:41:07,795
or a robber? It'll be dangerous.

878
00:41:08,516 --> 00:41:09,716
Most importantly,

879
00:41:11,236 --> 00:41:12,153
it's a long journey.

880
00:41:12,236 --> 00:41:14,635
You need a second driver somehow.

881
00:41:21,882 --> 00:41:23,197
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

882
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,157
(are referenced from relevant
traditional Chinese medicine books)

883
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,545
(Do not use without medical advice)
