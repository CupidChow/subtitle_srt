(Gen Z)

00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,885
(Episode 9)

3
00:01:39,836 --> 00:01:40,645
Tian Zhen,

4
00:01:40,836 --> 00:01:42,436
call her family member.

5
00:01:42,515 --> 00:01:44,355
Tell him to bring their child here
to see her one last time.

6
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,584
Okay.

7
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,124
Professor Ren!

8
00:01:48,836 --> 00:01:50,636
Holding onto me won't help you.

9
00:01:55,036 --> 00:01:55,853
Master,

10
00:01:56,356 --> 00:01:58,155
I just saw a dead person
for the first time in my life.

11
00:02:38,036 --> 00:02:38,836
What are you looking at?

12
00:02:40,835 --> 00:02:41,955
You scared me.

13
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:42,955
You took the words out of my mouth!

14
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:49,396
I'm exhausted.

15
00:02:51,875 --> 00:02:52,835
Besides giving patients diagnoses,

16
00:02:53,555 --> 00:02:54,396
I have to stay on my toes
because of you.

17
00:02:55,635 --> 00:02:56,676
I'll bring the cops to you

18
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,716
when they're here.

19
00:03:04,156 --> 00:03:05,195
Cheng Ying isn't dead.

20
00:03:05,235 --> 00:03:06,756
Why did you lie to her?

21
00:03:08,716 --> 00:03:10,315
You did great today.

22
00:03:11,716 --> 00:03:12,835
When you first came in,

23
00:03:12,835 --> 00:03:14,315
I thought you would run around,

24
00:03:14,315 --> 00:03:15,595
shouting that she wasn't dead.

25
00:03:20,595 --> 00:03:22,595
Am I that stupid to you?

26
00:03:25,796 --> 00:03:27,796
Although I don't know
why you're doing this,

27
00:03:27,796 --> 00:03:29,396
I know we're on the same side.

28
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:31,195
I have to play my part well.

29
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,549
Don't you think so?

30
00:03:40,476 --> 00:03:42,116
My master was right indeed.

31
00:03:43,316 --> 00:03:44,956
Even a dense person
can become intelligent.

32
00:03:47,035 --> 00:03:47,860
That was respectable.

33
00:03:51,915 --> 00:03:53,516
What do you mean by that?

34
00:04:00,915 --> 00:04:01,724
Get me a cup of water.

35
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,070
(Qibo Medical Centre)

36
00:04:47,915 --> 00:04:48,716
Professor Ren,

37
00:04:50,275 --> 00:04:52,956
if they do arrest me,

38
00:04:54,635 --> 00:04:56,796
can I entrust Jian Xi to you?

39
00:04:57,635 --> 00:04:59,076
In my life,

40
00:04:59,076 --> 00:05:00,436
there's no Ding Jian Xi.

41
00:05:01,915 --> 00:05:02,956
She's your daughter.

42
00:05:07,796 --> 00:05:08,629
Okay.

43
00:05:09,635 --> 00:05:10,436
If so,

44
00:05:11,156 --> 00:05:12,716
I'll apologise to them.

45
00:05:13,555 --> 00:05:14,956
I'll kneel

46
00:05:15,076 --> 00:05:16,236
and kowtow to them.

47
00:05:17,076 --> 00:05:18,876
I'll give them all my money.

48
00:05:19,555 --> 00:05:20,996
I'm fine with anything
as long as they let me off

49
00:05:22,195 --> 00:05:23,835
and let me take care of Jian Xi.

50
00:05:25,195 --> 00:05:27,195
Why are you expecting them
to let you off?

51
00:05:29,356 --> 00:05:31,796
Cheng Ying bumped into
your daughter, right?

52
00:05:33,436 --> 00:05:34,716
She's dead, right?

53
00:05:36,156 --> 00:05:37,275
What else can I do?

54
00:05:37,835 --> 00:05:39,356
You're giving them all of your money?

55
00:05:39,356 --> 00:05:40,956
How will you save your daughter by then?

56
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:44,436
As long as

57
00:05:45,716 --> 00:05:46,716
she's alive,

58
00:05:47,356 --> 00:05:50,555
I'll find a way to save her
even if it means that I have to sell

59
00:05:51,436 --> 00:05:52,716
my house, even my kidneys.

60
00:06:01,156 --> 00:06:02,716
Don't do that. Please get up.

61
00:06:05,835 --> 00:06:06,756
Professor Ren,

62
00:06:08,275 --> 00:06:09,436
you're a benevolent person.

63
00:06:09,996 --> 00:06:11,156
You have a benevolent mind and heart.

64
00:06:12,436 --> 00:06:14,196
Can you take me and my daughter in?

65
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,075
I can do anything.

66
00:06:17,275 --> 00:06:18,876
I was once an accountant.

67
00:06:19,275 --> 00:06:20,636
I can work as an admin.

68
00:06:21,275 --> 00:06:23,795
I can even be your janitor.

69
00:06:24,716 --> 00:06:26,555
I'll do anything you ask me to do

70
00:06:27,156 --> 00:06:28,555
as long as you take me
and my daughter in.

71
00:06:29,515 --> 00:06:31,996
You'll be imprisoned soon.

72
00:06:33,196 --> 00:06:35,075
How could you work here?

73
00:06:37,716 --> 00:06:39,596
Do you have any relatives?

74
00:06:39,596 --> 00:06:41,075
If you do, you should contact them.

75
00:06:42,075 --> 00:06:43,916
How will I deal with your daughter

76
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:46,075
after the cops arrest you?

77
00:06:52,515 --> 00:06:53,996
Hurry and make your decision.

78
00:06:54,996 --> 00:06:56,476
What should I do?

79
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:16,916
I'll be imprisoned soon!

80
00:07:17,636 --> 00:07:19,235
If I die now,

81
00:07:20,515 --> 00:07:23,795
I have no one to entrust my daughter to!

82
00:07:48,675 --> 00:07:50,036
Cheng Ying isn't dead.

83
00:07:54,196 --> 00:07:55,316
Get up.

84
00:07:55,395 --> 00:07:56,235
She's not dead?

85
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:57,196
She's not dead.

86
00:07:57,395 --> 00:07:58,515
I checked on her just now.

87
00:07:58,716 --> 00:07:59,675
She's alive.

88
00:07:59,795 --> 00:08:01,115
It's just that she's seriously ill.

89
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,120
She's not dead.

90
00:08:02,156 --> 00:08:03,196
Really?

91
00:08:03,235 --> 00:08:04,075
Really.

92
00:08:04,515 --> 00:08:05,395
I get to decide whether she dies or not

93
00:08:05,395 --> 00:08:06,996
when I'm around.

94
00:08:07,835 --> 00:08:08,675
Professor Ren,

95
00:08:09,955 --> 00:08:11,036
I'm begging you.

96
00:08:11,395 --> 00:08:13,555
Please save her

97
00:08:13,675 --> 00:08:15,115
on the account of my daughter.

98
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,520
Alright.

99
00:08:16,555 --> 00:08:17,636
Get up.

100
00:08:17,835 --> 00:08:18,955
Come.

101
00:08:18,955 --> 00:08:19,811
Be careful.

102
00:08:21,355 --> 00:08:22,156
Have some water.

103
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:28,916
Be careful.

104
00:08:32,955 --> 00:08:33,835
Do you still hate her?

105
00:08:35,075 --> 00:08:37,636
You felt pure joy after
experiencing pure sadness.

106
00:08:37,955 --> 00:08:38,996
How do you feel?

107
00:08:47,436 --> 00:08:48,316
Let me ask you something.

108
00:08:49,675 --> 00:08:51,115
Did you ever think about

109
00:08:51,115 --> 00:08:52,515
joining your husband

110
00:08:52,515 --> 00:08:53,675
when he departed from the world?

111
00:08:56,115 --> 00:08:57,395
When one is dead,

112
00:08:58,115 --> 00:08:59,675
nothing will be left.

113
00:08:59,955 --> 00:09:01,675
Your source of hatred and grudge

114
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:03,395
will be gone.

115
00:09:03,395 --> 00:09:05,036
What if you departed together with him?

116
00:09:05,675 --> 00:09:06,955
What will Jian Xi do then?

117
00:09:10,395 --> 00:09:12,515
Alright. You've already gotten through

118
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:14,835
the worst moment in your life.

119
00:09:15,436 --> 00:09:16,275
Anger

120
00:09:17,115 --> 00:09:18,636
makes slaves of people.

121
00:09:20,115 --> 00:09:21,795
When you get angry,

122
00:09:22,115 --> 00:09:25,115
you'll become your own slave.

123
00:09:27,955 --> 00:09:29,395
We forgive people

124
00:09:29,996 --> 00:09:31,075
to face

125
00:09:31,075 --> 00:09:32,955
our conscience.

126
00:09:34,636 --> 00:09:36,395
It's not like you've lost everything.

127
00:09:37,395 --> 00:09:38,555
You still have Jian Xi,

128
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,865
right?

129
00:09:45,675 --> 00:09:47,235
Have you found your tile?

130
00:09:49,675 --> 00:09:51,316
Look at you. You have been
spending all your energy

131
00:09:51,316 --> 00:09:54,075
on trying to sue people, demanding money

132
00:09:54,075 --> 00:09:54,884
and cursing them out.

133
00:09:55,275 --> 00:09:56,555
What will Jian Xi do then?

134
00:10:00,636 --> 00:10:01,835
I'll look for it.

135
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:03,675
I must save Jian Xi.

136
00:10:04,235 --> 00:10:06,555
That's why you should spend your energy

137
00:10:06,675 --> 00:10:08,996
on the things that matter.

138
00:10:10,756 --> 00:10:12,316
When you were angry,

139
00:10:12,436 --> 00:10:14,675
you forgot that
Jian Xi was by your side.

140
00:10:16,396 --> 00:10:18,276
What if Li Quan didn't save her?

141
00:10:18,355 --> 00:10:19,915
What if the wheelchair fell?

142
00:10:20,396 --> 00:10:22,196
Have you ever thought of
the consequences?

143
00:10:25,196 --> 00:10:27,915
Forgiving people means
forgiving yourself.

144
00:10:28,956 --> 00:10:30,396
You have to let go.

145
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:34,516
You must be starving.

146
00:10:35,675 --> 00:10:37,035
Jian Xi hasn't eaten yet.

147
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,700
Yeah.

148
00:10:40,076 --> 00:10:41,715
Jian Xi hasn't eaten yet.

"Aiding with the Best Medicine"

150
00:11:30,836 --> 00:11:31,661
Mr Ren.

151
00:11:36,276 --> 00:11:37,061
Something's up?

152
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,846
Yes.

153
00:11:39,516 --> 00:11:41,155
I hope you can do me a favour.

154
00:11:42,636 --> 00:11:43,836
Thank you for what you did today.

155
00:11:45,516 --> 00:11:46,468
It was my job.

156
00:11:47,316 --> 00:11:48,155
What is it? Tell me.

157
00:11:50,956 --> 00:11:51,836
My parents want

158
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:54,396
to celebrate the Dragon Boat Festival
here with me.

159
00:11:55,276 --> 00:11:57,276
Before this, I told them that...

160
00:11:59,396 --> 00:12:01,076
Stop hesitating.

161
00:12:01,076 --> 00:12:01,956
Speak up.

162
00:12:02,836 --> 00:12:03,836
Before this, I told them

163
00:12:03,836 --> 00:12:05,076
that I already found a job.

164
00:12:06,595 --> 00:12:07,516
So,

165
00:12:07,956 --> 00:12:09,636
can you tell them that I'm working here

166
00:12:09,956 --> 00:12:11,316
if you see them?

167
00:12:12,836 --> 00:12:13,795
Can you tell them I'm a staff here?

168
00:12:14,555 --> 00:12:16,316
Why would our medical centre
even hire staff in the first place?

169
00:12:17,876 --> 00:12:19,035
I know that's not the case.

170
00:12:21,595 --> 00:12:23,196
But can you tell them that?

171
00:12:25,396 --> 00:12:27,076
You want me to lie to them?

172
00:12:29,155 --> 00:12:30,035
Listen.

173
00:12:30,196 --> 00:12:31,516
I never lie.

174
00:12:31,715 --> 00:12:33,715
And, I will never lie for your sake.

175
00:12:35,276 --> 00:12:36,956
Once you lie, you need to lie ten times

176
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:38,636
to cover up your first lie.

177
00:12:38,836 --> 00:12:40,396
If you wish to obtain something,

178
00:12:40,715 --> 00:12:42,316
you must strive to obtain it.

179
00:12:42,316 --> 00:12:43,436
Do not rely on expediency.

180
00:12:44,276 --> 00:12:45,085
Understood?

181
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:21,436
Sorry for being late.

182
00:13:21,516 --> 00:13:22,996
I couldn't recognise you in this outfit.

183
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:25,316
What kind of outfit is this?

184
00:13:26,475 --> 00:13:27,956
I don't like the smell of kitchen fumes.

185
00:13:28,636 --> 00:13:29,996
Sorry then, Ms Yang.

186
00:13:30,836 --> 00:13:31,876
You haven't ordered any food yet, right?

187
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,760
Listen,

188
00:13:32,796 --> 00:13:34,076
the roasted kidneys here

189
00:13:34,196 --> 00:13:35,076
are amazing.

190
00:13:37,836 --> 00:13:39,076
I... I forgot.

191
00:13:39,076 --> 00:13:40,155
You're a vegetarian.

192
00:13:40,475 --> 00:13:42,196
Their roasted chives and mushrooms

193
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:43,595
are great too.

194
00:13:43,595 --> 00:13:44,836
Don't order food for me.

195
00:13:45,595 --> 00:13:46,636
I waited until now

196
00:13:46,636 --> 00:13:48,355
to reject you directly.

197
00:13:48,516 --> 00:13:49,956
The tuition class between us

198
00:13:49,956 --> 00:13:50,876
is over.

199
00:13:50,876 --> 00:13:51,996
Okay? Let's go on our separate ways.

200
00:13:53,956 --> 00:13:54,836
What are you doing?

201
00:13:55,076 --> 00:13:56,155
Return my bag to me.

202
00:13:56,155 --> 00:13:57,475
You can keep this bag

203
00:13:57,475 --> 00:13:58,276
with me first.

204
00:13:58,276 --> 00:14:00,475
I'll return it to you once
the tuition class is over.

205
00:14:00,876 --> 00:14:02,076
-You!
-Madam!

206
00:14:03,196 --> 00:14:05,516
Give us ten roasted lamb skewers,

207
00:14:05,516 --> 00:14:06,876
ten roasted kidney skewers,

208
00:14:06,876 --> 00:14:09,076
one roasted mushroom skewer
and one roasted chives skewer.

209
00:14:09,836 --> 00:14:10,996
-Just like the usual.
-Alright.

210
00:14:11,035 --> 00:14:12,076
Didn't I tell you already?

211
00:14:12,076 --> 00:14:13,396
I'm not eating.
Don't order anything for me.

212
00:14:13,396 --> 00:14:14,715
I don't take junk food.

213
00:14:14,956 --> 00:14:15,956
I ordered them for myself.

214
00:14:37,636 --> 00:14:38,476
Delicious.

215
00:14:40,636 --> 00:14:41,715
It's a shame that
you're not trying them.

216
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:44,956
Let me tell you this.

217
00:14:44,956 --> 00:14:46,956
I came here today

218
00:14:46,956 --> 00:14:49,155
because I thought it was closer
to your hospital.

219
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:50,595
But it won't happen again.

220
00:14:51,196 --> 00:14:51,989
Yeah, yeah.

221
00:14:52,276 --> 00:14:53,876
But according to
my limited life experience,

222
00:14:53,876 --> 00:14:54,956
only bars and roasted skewer stalls

223
00:14:54,956 --> 00:14:56,595
are still open at this hour.

224
00:14:56,636 --> 00:14:58,076
Bars are too loud.

225
00:14:58,076 --> 00:14:59,235
I don't think we can hold
our tuition class there.

226
00:14:59,595 --> 00:15:01,396
Can't you change it
to another time then?

227
00:15:01,956 --> 00:15:03,276
I'm having tuition classes
during my night shifts

228
00:15:03,276 --> 00:15:05,276
so that I can head to the medical centre
during my rest days.

229
00:15:10,836 --> 00:15:11,645
Alright.

230
00:15:12,316 --> 00:15:13,153
Let's begin.

231
00:15:14,396 --> 00:15:15,636
You're taking

232
00:15:15,636 --> 00:15:18,155
something this oily and salty at night.

233
00:15:18,155 --> 00:15:20,316
Your lifestyle is so unhealthy.

234
00:15:21,196 --> 00:15:22,956
Just finish your yogurt
and be done with your preaching.

235
00:15:23,636 --> 00:15:25,316
You're a doctor, you know?

236
00:15:26,516 --> 00:15:27,915
I study Western medicine.

237
00:15:29,196 --> 00:15:31,436
However, I'm giving you tuition
regarding TCM.

238
00:15:31,595 --> 00:15:33,636
TCM focuses on wellness.

239
00:15:33,636 --> 00:15:35,675
Focusing on one's wellness should be
prioritized above treating illnesses.

240
00:15:35,675 --> 00:15:36,715
So, according to your TCM theories,

241
00:15:36,715 --> 00:15:38,475
at this time, you should
leave your phone in the living room

242
00:15:38,475 --> 00:15:39,756
and lie on the bed, right?

243
00:15:41,035 --> 00:15:42,756
You're staying up to teach me about TCM.

244
00:15:42,836 --> 00:15:44,956
I can only repay you

245
00:15:44,956 --> 00:15:45,876
with such a method.

246
00:15:59,516 --> 00:16:00,516
For this chapter,

247
00:16:01,876 --> 00:16:03,715
we focus on

248
00:16:03,715 --> 00:16:05,475
the relationship between
one's nature, heart, and body.

249
00:16:05,475 --> 00:16:06,595
According to Mr Ren,

250
00:16:06,956 --> 00:16:09,715
even if we do retain our fitness,

251
00:16:10,076 --> 00:16:13,595
we're only 10% there.

252
00:16:13,595 --> 00:16:15,475
The other 40% comes from

253
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,756
the health of one's mentality.

254
00:16:18,316 --> 00:16:21,915
And, the one leading our health
is the health of our nature.

255
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:22,917
Look.

256
00:16:23,715 --> 00:16:24,876
I'm right, aren't I?

257
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:27,155
TCM and Western medicine
are finally coming together.

258
00:16:27,396 --> 00:16:28,715
One's diet isn't important at all.

259
00:16:28,876 --> 00:16:31,555
If I do die early, it must be
due to a lack of sexual activities.

260
00:16:32,836 --> 00:16:34,235
That wasn't what I was referring to.

261
00:16:34,795 --> 00:16:35,956
It means disposition

262
00:16:35,956 --> 00:16:37,196
and spirituality.

263
00:16:37,715 --> 00:16:40,956
It's an element
that's above one's heart.

264
00:16:41,516 --> 00:16:42,795
It's the inner core of life.

265
00:16:43,276 --> 00:16:44,396
According to
Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic,

266
00:16:44,836 --> 00:16:46,276
somatic and spiritual harmony
are of utmost importance.

267
00:16:46,595 --> 00:16:47,956
A healthy body

268
00:16:48,316 --> 00:16:50,475
requires a fit physical body

269
00:16:50,636 --> 00:16:53,516
and a healthy state of mind.

270
00:16:53,956 --> 00:16:55,155
We should be tranquil

271
00:16:55,876 --> 00:16:56,915
and have a sound mind.

272
00:16:58,076 --> 00:17:00,516
That's what I meant by nature.

273
00:17:01,076 --> 00:17:02,276
Our teacher said this during our class.

274
00:17:02,876 --> 00:17:05,996
Language represents
the evolution of thoughts.

275
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:07,996
What were you thinking about?

276
00:17:08,316 --> 00:17:09,836
I'm just here to give you a tuition.

277
00:17:10,715 --> 00:17:12,595
Fine. Seems like you're done
with studying anyway.

278
00:17:13,035 --> 00:17:14,475
-It's over.
-You're angry now?

279
00:17:15,355 --> 00:17:16,316
You're a lawyer, right?

280
00:17:16,675 --> 00:17:17,795
You're studying TCM too.

281
00:17:18,035 --> 00:17:21,115
Being emotional is detrimental to us.

282
00:17:21,316 --> 00:17:23,316
You cannot be emotional
when you're in the court.

283
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:25,076
When it comes to studying TCM,

284
00:17:25,076 --> 00:17:27,996
we need to be indifferent
when we're happy, angry, sad, or joyful.

285
00:17:27,996 --> 00:17:29,555
Only then, we can retain our hearts.

286
00:17:29,795 --> 00:17:31,035
What do you think? I did do my homework.

287
00:17:31,956 --> 00:17:32,915
I'm not angry.

288
00:17:34,115 --> 00:17:35,756
I just want to head back
and take my beauty sleep.

289
00:17:37,035 --> 00:17:37,915
Alright.

290
00:17:38,155 --> 00:17:40,115
I apologise to you sincerely.

291
00:17:41,675 --> 00:17:43,915
You're both a great teacher
and a great student.

292
00:17:43,915 --> 00:17:45,316
It was tough for you to teach me.

293
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:46,211
I'm sorry.

294
00:17:47,595 --> 00:17:48,756
I'm not a good student.

295
00:17:49,715 --> 00:17:52,396
If I were one, I wouldn't
need to study TCM.

296
00:17:53,795 --> 00:17:54,620
But why?

297
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:58,555
I learned many things in the past.

298
00:17:59,235 --> 00:18:00,516
I excelled in all of them.

299
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:02,795
But even now, I still don't understand

300
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:04,196
the meaning of life.

301
00:18:05,475 --> 00:18:07,956
In the past, I strove to improve myself

302
00:18:08,675 --> 00:18:10,235
to make my mother happy.

303
00:18:10,996 --> 00:18:12,115
I worked hard to make money

304
00:18:13,155 --> 00:18:14,555
so that I could sustain her life.

305
00:18:16,115 --> 00:18:17,475
But after her passing,

306
00:18:17,876 --> 00:18:19,196
I suddenly realised

307
00:18:21,396 --> 00:18:23,235
that making money and improving myself

308
00:18:23,516 --> 00:18:24,836
were pointless.

309
00:18:27,956 --> 00:18:28,773
Do you know something?

310
00:18:29,196 --> 00:18:30,035
Some time ago,

311
00:18:30,035 --> 00:18:31,196
the opposing lawyer of a lawsuit

312
00:18:31,196 --> 00:18:32,836
fell unconscious in front of me.

313
00:18:33,076 --> 00:18:34,235
He died just like that.

314
00:18:35,076 --> 00:18:37,115
After that, I thought about
all the law articles I learned.

315
00:18:37,396 --> 00:18:38,595
Why did I learn them in the first place?

316
00:18:41,616 --> 00:18:42,756
Mr Ren was right.

317
00:18:44,036 --> 00:18:46,715
Even if you're knowledgeable,
that doesn't mean you're cultured.

318
00:18:46,715 --> 00:18:47,676
We transform people through culture.

319
00:18:48,636 --> 00:18:49,756
Forget about transforming other people.

320
00:18:51,315 --> 00:18:53,676
I can't even transform myself.

321
00:18:56,075 --> 00:18:57,036
You're transforming me right now.

322
00:18:58,276 --> 00:18:59,516
I'm not that capable.

323
00:18:59,796 --> 00:19:00,756
You're a stubborn soul.

324
00:19:00,756 --> 00:19:02,715
You're taking junk food
in the middle of the night.

325
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:05,276
I have a good nature.

326
00:19:05,396 --> 00:19:06,276
I'm broad-minded.

327
00:19:06,276 --> 00:19:07,715
I don't take things too seriously.

328
00:19:07,715 --> 00:19:09,475
That's the root of good health.

329
00:19:13,315 --> 00:19:14,556
Broad-minded, huh?

330
00:19:14,835 --> 00:19:16,955
Explain why you came
to cause trouble for our class

331
00:19:17,516 --> 00:19:19,636
and got into a fight
with a patient's family member.

332
00:19:21,195 --> 00:19:22,355
Why do you know all of my secrets?

333
00:19:22,756 --> 00:19:24,475
How did you know that I was a spy?

334
00:19:25,036 --> 00:19:26,475
It wasn't a secret at all.

335
00:19:27,195 --> 00:19:29,595
Mr Ren knew it from
the day you joined us.

336
00:19:30,276 --> 00:19:31,355
You were scrolling your phone
during class.

337
00:19:31,876 --> 00:19:32,876
And, you kept causing arguments.

338
00:19:33,315 --> 00:19:34,516
I'll be honest with you.

339
00:19:34,516 --> 00:19:35,475
I only came here to give you tuition

340
00:19:35,475 --> 00:19:36,955
because of Mr Ren.

341
00:19:36,955 --> 00:19:38,276
If not, do you think

342
00:19:38,396 --> 00:19:40,595
I'll waste my time with you here?

343
00:19:40,835 --> 00:19:42,036
Mr Ren knew about it?

344
00:19:42,156 --> 00:19:43,075
Of course.

345
00:19:43,075 --> 00:19:44,636
If so, why did he still send you here?

346
00:19:45,595 --> 00:19:46,796
Mr Ren

347
00:19:47,195 --> 00:19:49,355
has placed himself and his lesson

348
00:19:49,756 --> 00:19:51,955
on a microscope for you to see.

349
00:19:53,115 --> 00:19:55,355
Western medicine focuses on
the patient's illness

350
00:19:55,516 --> 00:19:57,355
while TCM focuses on the sick person.

351
00:19:58,355 --> 00:19:59,516
You can cause an argument

352
00:19:59,516 --> 00:20:00,475
and create trouble all you want.

353
00:20:01,195 --> 00:20:02,235
But Mr Ren intends

354
00:20:02,235 --> 00:20:04,595
to cure you of your rowdy nature.

355
00:20:16,475 --> 00:20:17,268
Madam,

356
00:20:17,756 --> 00:20:18,676
get me another bottle of yogurt.

357
00:20:19,235 --> 00:20:20,955
-Okay.
-Get me a sugar-free yogurt.

358
00:20:21,756 --> 00:20:22,628
Coming.

359
00:21:53,996 --> 00:21:55,676
What are you doing here?
Did you tail me?

360
00:21:59,996 --> 00:22:00,908
You...

361
00:22:00,955 --> 00:22:02,595
You know how to ride skateboards?

362
00:22:03,115 --> 00:22:04,475
I know plenty of things.

363
00:22:04,876 --> 00:22:05,709
Ren Tian Zhen.

364
00:22:08,955 --> 00:22:09,756
This is pretty cool.

365
00:22:10,636 --> 00:22:12,075
I want to learn this too.

366
00:22:15,235 --> 00:22:16,195
You want to learn
how to ride skateboards?

367
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,050
Yeah.

368
00:22:17,075 --> 00:22:18,315
-Really?
-Yeah.

369
00:22:18,636 --> 00:22:19,595
But I don't feel like teaching you.

370
00:22:23,276 --> 00:22:24,636
If you don't teach me,

371
00:22:26,115 --> 00:22:27,475
I'll tell your parents

372
00:22:28,115 --> 00:22:29,315
and grandparents

373
00:22:29,636 --> 00:22:31,876
that you're playing with something
as dangerous as this.

374
00:22:31,955 --> 00:22:32,756
It's very dangerous.

375
00:22:32,835 --> 00:22:34,235
It's lethal and dangerous.

376
00:22:34,235 --> 00:22:35,355
I'll tell them right away.

377
00:22:35,636 --> 00:22:36,636
Are you a primary school student?

378
00:22:36,636 --> 00:22:37,636
You want to complain
to your teacher now?

379
00:22:41,756 --> 00:22:43,475
Go ahead then. You'll be exposed
for joining me too.

380
00:22:44,195 --> 00:22:45,036
That's fine.

381
00:22:45,115 --> 00:22:46,876
I'm parentless anyway.

382
00:22:46,876 --> 00:22:48,156
No one is keeping me in check.

383
00:22:48,235 --> 00:22:49,715
But it's different for someone else.

384
00:22:50,115 --> 00:22:52,435
You're their beloved baby.

385
00:22:52,756 --> 00:22:54,195
Your grandparents will surely nag you

386
00:22:54,195 --> 00:22:55,355
after they find out.

387
00:22:55,355 --> 00:22:57,115
You have to stand there
and endure their nagging

388
00:22:57,115 --> 00:22:58,556
without talking back.

389
00:22:58,636 --> 00:22:59,835
If Meng Meng sees that,

390
00:22:59,876 --> 00:23:01,276
-Stop!
-as a man...

391
00:23:01,276 --> 00:23:02,169
Stop.

392
00:23:02,355 --> 00:23:03,180
I'll teach you.

393
00:23:04,475 --> 00:23:05,435
But you have to swear.

394
00:23:06,235 --> 00:23:07,636
Only you and I know about this.

395
00:23:07,996 --> 00:23:09,835
Never tell a single soul about this.

396
00:23:09,835 --> 00:23:12,115
I swear I'll never tell a single soul.

397
00:23:12,115 --> 00:23:13,556
If you break your promise,

398
00:23:13,715 --> 00:23:15,835
may you starve for
the rest of your life.

399
00:23:20,075 --> 00:23:20,915
That's pretty brutal.

400
00:23:21,756 --> 00:23:23,475
I promise. When will you teach me?

401
00:23:24,916 --> 00:23:26,355
Meng Meng's medicine is ready, right?

402
00:23:26,595 --> 00:23:27,459
What medicine?

403
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:31,756
Oh no!

404
00:23:33,396 --> 00:23:34,516
Remember to teach me next time!

405
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:40,716
Thank you.

406
00:23:41,075 --> 00:23:41,931
Don't mention it.

407
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,221
Hello, Madam.

408
00:23:44,355 --> 00:23:45,475
-Hello.
-Madam,

409
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,418
I'm here to pick up my parcel.

410
00:23:46,443 --> 00:23:47,835
I'm Xiao Ming from Dorm 312.

411
00:23:47,835 --> 00:23:48,876
312, Xiao Ming.

412
00:23:50,835 --> 00:23:52,115
312, Xiao Ming.

413
00:23:52,115 --> 00:23:52,908
Here.

414
00:23:54,636 --> 00:23:55,916
-Thank you, Madam.
-You're welcome.

415
00:23:58,115 --> 00:23:58,979
Hello, Madam.

416
00:23:59,075 --> 00:23:59,868
Hello.

417
00:24:15,636 --> 00:24:16,556
What's the matter?

418
00:24:17,235 --> 00:24:18,075
I guess

419
00:24:18,396 --> 00:24:19,276
we have another power outage.

420
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,240
What's going on?

421
00:24:20,263 --> 00:24:21,156
What's going on?

422
00:24:21,156 --> 00:24:22,396
The power tripped again?

423
00:24:24,075 --> 00:24:25,315
We have another power outage?

424
00:24:25,516 --> 00:24:26,475
Sorry about that.

425
00:24:27,195 --> 00:24:28,156
Open the door!

426
00:24:28,156 --> 00:24:29,435
Hide! Hurry up!

427
00:24:29,756 --> 00:24:30,876
Why did the power trip again?

428
00:24:31,115 --> 00:24:31,996
Coming.

429
00:24:34,636 --> 00:24:35,508
Coming.

430
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:39,115
You must've used something
that you were not supposed to.

431
00:24:43,115 --> 00:24:43,955
I knew it.

432
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:45,475
Didn't I say that you couldn't
bring this here?

433
00:24:47,996 --> 00:24:49,115
You were actually
cooking dumplings here?

434
00:24:49,355 --> 00:24:50,916
Sorry, Madam. I was starving.

435
00:24:51,195 --> 00:24:52,115
I won't do it again.

436
00:24:52,715 --> 00:24:53,996
I'll never do it again.

437
00:24:53,996 --> 00:24:55,676
-Okay?
-How many times have I told you?

438
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:56,861
Yes, Madam.

439
00:25:04,396 --> 00:25:05,236
Who are you?

440
00:25:05,835 --> 00:25:06,756
What are you doing here?

441
00:25:11,315 --> 00:25:12,140
Madam.

442
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,070
(Qibo Medical Centre)

443
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,075
You were chased out?

444
00:25:18,355 --> 00:25:19,396
Where are you staying then?

445
00:25:19,516 --> 00:25:21,315
I found a cheap place online.

446
00:25:21,876 --> 00:25:23,835
One day costs around 30 to 40 yuan.

447
00:25:23,835 --> 00:25:24,715
Can you take a bath there?

448
00:25:25,756 --> 00:25:27,075
Take a bath?

449
00:25:27,075 --> 00:25:28,475
I'm lucky enough
to find a place to stay.

450
00:25:30,636 --> 00:25:32,315
It's easy for you to make remarks
when you're on the sideline.

451
00:25:36,396 --> 00:25:37,276
I'll find a place for you.

452
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,000
See?

453
00:25:43,115 --> 00:25:45,235
When you want to sleep, just bring
this bed to the storeroom.

454
00:25:46,996 --> 00:25:47,829
This is inappropriate.

455
00:25:48,115 --> 00:25:49,676
What's inappropriate about it?

456
00:25:49,996 --> 00:25:50,996
I'll be here for you
if you get into trouble.

457
00:25:52,235 --> 00:25:53,715
Besides, you're truly stubborn.

458
00:25:53,955 --> 00:25:56,475
If I were you, I would try to be
a medical assistant here

459
00:25:56,636 --> 00:25:58,315
and survive first.

460
00:25:58,396 --> 00:25:59,595
You and I are different.

461
00:26:02,115 --> 00:26:04,516
Say, if I do work in this medical centre

462
00:26:04,516 --> 00:26:05,955
like my other seniors,

463
00:26:05,955 --> 00:26:07,876
even if I do get my own
consultation office after ten years,

464
00:26:09,396 --> 00:26:10,676
do you think people will
seek my service after that?

465
00:26:11,715 --> 00:26:12,876
In this industry,

466
00:26:12,876 --> 00:26:14,756
value comes with age.

467
00:26:15,475 --> 00:26:16,595
You're different.

468
00:26:16,595 --> 00:26:18,235
You had a silver-spoon upbringing.

469
00:26:18,876 --> 00:26:20,516
You grew up in an esteemed family.

470
00:26:20,516 --> 00:26:21,556
No matter which mentor you get,

471
00:26:21,556 --> 00:26:22,955
they're the cream of the crop.

472
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:23,960
But me?

473
00:26:23,996 --> 00:26:25,235
I can only say this for myself.

474
00:26:26,235 --> 00:26:28,075
If one of the mentors
takes a liking to me,

475
00:26:28,195 --> 00:26:29,756
and if I learn under him,

476
00:26:29,756 --> 00:26:31,996
maybe I can be independent
after five years.

477
00:26:32,355 --> 00:26:33,195
Tell me then.

478
00:26:34,516 --> 00:26:36,396
What will I do

479
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:37,715
if I don't depend on the medical centre?

480
00:26:38,876 --> 00:26:41,195
Free opportunities for people
to learn under a mentor

481
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:43,355
were created for people like me,
you know?

482
00:26:49,516 --> 00:26:51,075
These are the keys
to the medical centre.

483
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:52,156
Just remember

484
00:26:52,396 --> 00:26:53,876
to bring the bed back and hide it here

485
00:26:53,876 --> 00:26:55,916
before work hours.

486
00:26:57,235 --> 00:26:58,068
Got it.

487
00:27:00,276 --> 00:27:01,435
You don't intend to thank me?

488
00:27:02,396 --> 00:27:03,475
Thank you so much.

489
00:27:03,475 --> 00:27:04,315
You're too courteous.

490
00:27:08,955 --> 00:27:10,235
Why did you transfer money to me again?

491
00:27:11,115 --> 00:27:12,955
I made some pocket money
when I joined Grandpa

492
00:27:12,955 --> 00:27:13,955
in his consultations.

493
00:27:13,955 --> 00:27:15,595
Of course I need to share
good things with my buddy.

494
00:27:16,195 --> 00:27:17,876
Your grandfather actually
split the money with you?

495
00:27:17,876 --> 00:27:19,475
Nope. It's all mine.

496
00:27:19,756 --> 00:27:20,955
We had a promise.

497
00:27:21,195 --> 00:27:22,396
He'll work for me as long as

498
00:27:22,396 --> 00:27:23,276
I'm willing to join him
in his consultations.

499
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:25,996
If so, I won't stand on ceremony then.

500
00:27:26,276 --> 00:27:27,475
There's no need to stand on ceremony.

501
00:27:33,636 --> 00:27:34,484
Mr Ren.

502
00:27:38,475 --> 00:27:39,516
What are you two doing here?

503
00:27:42,235 --> 00:27:43,115
We're here on cleaning duties.

504
00:27:49,996 --> 00:27:52,475
So, you don't need tools for that?

505
00:27:55,756 --> 00:27:56,796
We'll get them at once.

506
00:27:59,115 --> 00:28:00,396
-Mr Wu.
-Mr Wu.

507
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:01,448
Kid.

508
00:28:02,595 --> 00:28:03,404
How did it go?

509
00:28:03,595 --> 00:28:04,475
You must've received
the invitation by now.

510
00:28:04,955 --> 00:28:05,996
I received it yesterday.

511
00:28:06,756 --> 00:28:09,475
Fellow Zhang will be
the honorary chairman this year.

512
00:28:09,996 --> 00:28:12,235
You will be our main speaker.

513
00:28:12,876 --> 00:28:14,435
I still want Huang Wei
to be our speaker.

514
00:28:14,516 --> 00:28:15,796
You should give
the younger generations a chance.

515
00:28:17,715 --> 00:28:20,115
Which student do you intend
to bring with you?

516
00:28:20,396 --> 00:28:22,796
Tian Zhen, Li Quan,

517
00:28:23,156 --> 00:28:24,115
and Sun Tou Tou.

518
00:28:25,595 --> 00:28:26,636
Sun Tou Tou?

519
00:28:27,115 --> 00:28:27,996
Do you think someone will take her in?

520
00:28:28,115 --> 00:28:29,715
Were you referring to Sun Tou Tou?

521
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:31,680
Sun Tou Tou

522
00:28:31,702 --> 00:28:34,680
is the successor of the Jiang family's
acupuncture sect after all.

523
00:28:35,715 --> 00:28:37,475
She already assumed her position.

524
00:28:38,355 --> 00:28:40,475
She has to go there no matter what.

525
00:28:41,876 --> 00:28:45,396
I'm just worried that she might
bring disgrace to TCM Acupuncture.

526
00:28:45,756 --> 00:28:48,036
This is TCM Acupuncture's
first appearance.

527
00:28:48,756 --> 00:28:50,595
Just look at her primitive behaviour.

528
00:28:50,595 --> 00:28:52,715
What do you think people
will say about you

529
00:28:52,715 --> 00:28:54,475
and TCM Acupuncture?

530
00:28:55,235 --> 00:28:57,235
That's their business.

531
00:28:57,756 --> 00:28:59,876
It's her business whether she can become

532
00:29:00,036 --> 00:29:00,876
a worthy successor or not.

533
00:29:01,276 --> 00:29:02,475
It's my business

534
00:29:02,676 --> 00:29:03,796
whether I bring her there or not.

535
00:29:04,195 --> 00:29:06,235
We all have our parts to do.

536
00:29:07,955 --> 00:29:09,235
You're making it too simple here.

537
00:29:09,715 --> 00:29:11,955
You can afford to take it lightly
since you don't have any position.

538
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:14,595
Now, I'm attending the forum

539
00:29:14,595 --> 00:29:15,835
as the academy's principal.

540
00:29:16,355 --> 00:29:17,164
But you?

541
00:29:17,595 --> 00:29:18,835
You're trying to link my academy

542
00:29:19,115 --> 00:29:20,796
with your so-called students,

543
00:29:20,796 --> 00:29:21,756
which have complicated backgrounds.

544
00:29:21,756 --> 00:29:23,996
What do you think people will say
about our industry as a whole?

545
00:29:24,636 --> 00:29:25,876
Besides, you shouldn't forget.

546
00:29:26,516 --> 00:29:29,075
I'm holding on to this position
for your sake.

547
00:29:29,475 --> 00:29:31,676
You have to consider my feelings.

548
00:29:32,756 --> 00:29:34,435
That's your business.

549
00:29:34,636 --> 00:29:35,508
But...

550
00:29:36,115 --> 00:29:38,235
I'm sure it's everyone's business
to maintain our reputation, right?

551
00:29:39,595 --> 00:29:40,475
Reputation, huh?

552
00:29:46,595 --> 00:29:47,435
Meng Meng,

553
00:29:47,636 --> 00:29:48,636
sesame seeds

554
00:29:48,756 --> 00:29:50,876
are good for injuries and deficiencies.
It also nourishes the five viscera.

555
00:29:56,235 --> 00:29:57,075
Try it.

556
00:30:00,355 --> 00:30:01,180
It's nice, right?

557
00:30:04,235 --> 00:30:06,315
This is for Wu Jun.

558
00:30:07,516 --> 00:30:08,916
He has to get twice the dosage.

559
00:30:11,396 --> 00:30:12,756
Ms Xia?

560
00:30:14,996 --> 00:30:15,813
So,

561
00:30:16,195 --> 00:30:18,115
Jian Xi's follow-up visit

562
00:30:18,115 --> 00:30:18,996
is in two days, right?

563
00:30:18,996 --> 00:30:20,676
What are you guys doing here today?

564
00:30:21,075 --> 00:30:22,475
Not only will we come today,

565
00:30:22,475 --> 00:30:24,276
but we'll also come here every day.

566
00:30:25,595 --> 00:30:26,715
What do you mean?

567
00:30:26,715 --> 00:30:28,195
Ms Xia, listen.

568
00:30:28,475 --> 00:30:31,036
Sometimes, you need to let go.

569
00:30:31,036 --> 00:30:32,475
Calm down.

570
00:30:32,475 --> 00:30:33,876
I'm not here to stir up trouble.

571
00:30:34,195 --> 00:30:35,396
I'm here to help.

572
00:30:35,996 --> 00:30:37,676
I told Professor Ren

573
00:30:37,835 --> 00:30:39,156
that I worked as an accountant before.

574
00:30:39,235 --> 00:30:40,276
From today onward,

575
00:30:40,396 --> 00:30:42,636
I will work as a volunteer here.

576
00:30:42,955 --> 00:30:44,115
Today's my first day of work.

577
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,600
Really?

578
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:47,876
I never heard about that.

579
00:30:47,876 --> 00:30:49,955
Weren't you here too back then?

580
00:30:50,955 --> 00:30:52,715
If so, have you stopped
looking for the tiles?

581
00:30:52,876 --> 00:30:53,715
Of course not.

582
00:30:53,835 --> 00:30:55,235
I've already hired someone
to inquire about them for me.

583
00:30:55,396 --> 00:30:56,916
I'll depart immediately
once I receive any news.

584
00:30:57,235 --> 00:30:58,876
By then, I will leave Jian Xi...

585
00:30:59,276 --> 00:31:00,756
-No problem.
-Meng Meng.

586
00:31:02,876 --> 00:31:03,740
Meng Meng.

587
00:31:04,876 --> 00:31:05,676
Meng Meng.

588
00:31:06,876 --> 00:31:08,075
It'll be fine. Go now.

589
00:31:08,756 --> 00:31:09,604
Come here.

590
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,600
Meng Meng.

591
00:31:10,756 --> 00:31:11,996
Meng Meng, come here.

592
00:31:12,235 --> 00:31:13,955
I'm not here to fight today.

593
00:31:14,715 --> 00:31:16,876
I must've scared you guys back then.

594
00:31:16,876 --> 00:31:17,715
Not at all.

595
00:31:17,835 --> 00:31:18,668
Not at all.

596
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,760
Go now. It'll be fine.

597
00:31:20,782 --> 00:31:22,315
I'm not here to fight.

598
00:31:25,235 --> 00:31:26,115
Everything's fine.

599
00:31:26,876 --> 00:31:27,876
Don't be scared.

600
00:31:27,876 --> 00:31:28,876
Zhu Xia, you're here?

601
00:31:28,876 --> 00:31:29,676
Dr Song.

602
00:31:29,676 --> 00:31:30,996
Who's afraid?

603
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,083
Listen.

604
00:31:33,282 --> 00:31:34,115
That's right.

605
00:31:34,235 --> 00:31:37,475
This ledger contains
this month's records.

606
00:31:37,475 --> 00:31:38,147
Take it.

607
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,147
Take a close look.

608
00:31:39,195 --> 00:31:40,556
Yes. Meng Meng loves to draw.

609
00:31:40,556 --> 00:31:41,412
Familiarize yourself with our accounts.

610
00:31:42,195 --> 00:31:43,756
I'll leave this to you then.

611
00:31:44,516 --> 00:31:46,315
Now that I'm here,
you don't need to worry.

612
00:31:49,516 --> 00:31:50,396
Jian Xi.

613
00:31:52,715 --> 00:31:53,595
Dr Song.

614
00:31:55,876 --> 00:31:56,756
Say,

615
00:31:56,996 --> 00:31:58,955
she did change a lot.

616
00:31:59,996 --> 00:32:00,932
This is amazing.

617
00:32:04,276 --> 00:32:05,315
Your master is amazing, right?

618
00:32:10,835 --> 00:32:11,876
He's pretty amazing.

619
00:32:13,996 --> 00:32:15,715
Meng Meng, that looked great.

620
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,737
(Plantable grains)

621
00:32:22,026 --> 00:32:24,439
(lose their effectiveness
after this season.)

622
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,625
(This solar term)

623
00:32:27,318 --> 00:32:30,925
(is the time when the South plants
grains and the North harvests wheat.)

624
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,579
(Grain in Ear)

625
00:32:45,676 --> 00:32:49,636
TCM is the manifestation of the term
"technique and integrity".

626
00:32:49,996 --> 00:32:53,156
However, without integrity, you can't
make it far with technique alone.

627
00:32:53,396 --> 00:32:54,996
Even if you have excellent
medical skills,

628
00:32:55,355 --> 00:32:56,835
without harmony between nature and men

629
00:32:58,115 --> 00:32:59,276
and a broad philosophical view,

630
00:32:59,276 --> 00:33:01,235
you won't be able to understand

631
00:33:02,235 --> 00:33:04,955
the meaning of "integrity"
when it comes to medical skills.

632
00:33:06,075 --> 00:33:09,355
That's the difference between
TCM and Western medicine.

633
00:33:09,355 --> 00:33:10,556
In my opinion,

634
00:33:11,636 --> 00:33:14,355
Western medicine will
develop into a detailed

635
00:33:15,115 --> 00:33:16,396
and meticulous field.

636
00:33:16,996 --> 00:33:18,115
As for TCM,

637
00:33:19,195 --> 00:33:22,756
it should develop in
a broader direction.

638
00:33:23,756 --> 00:33:25,396
For our lesson today,

639
00:33:25,876 --> 00:33:26,835
we'll talk about

640
00:33:28,595 --> 00:33:31,235
the largest disharmony in humans.

641
00:33:34,756 --> 00:33:35,589
What is it?

642
00:33:38,756 --> 00:33:40,195
It's disharmony between humans.

643
00:33:42,835 --> 00:33:43,691
Everyone,

644
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:46,475
do you know who's the star of

645
00:33:46,475 --> 00:33:47,796
our TCM industrial park?

646
00:33:47,796 --> 00:33:48,621
Who?

647
00:33:49,115 --> 00:33:50,115
It's Ren Xin Zheng.

648
00:33:51,475 --> 00:33:52,355
Professor Ren?

649
00:33:52,996 --> 00:33:54,276
He's pretty famous.

650
00:33:54,276 --> 00:33:55,636
What? Is he here?

651
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:57,876
We are friends for many years.

652
00:33:57,876 --> 00:33:59,955
Now, he's hosting a class
at my place.

653
00:34:00,756 --> 00:34:03,195
He's the representative figure
of our industrial park.

654
00:34:03,636 --> 00:34:04,676
He's hosting a class?

655
00:34:06,195 --> 00:34:07,955
We plan to build

656
00:34:07,955 --> 00:34:09,235
a first-class national

657
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:11,396
TCM talent training centre.

658
00:34:13,355 --> 00:34:15,195
Right now, the projects that
occupy most of your land here

659
00:34:15,195 --> 00:34:16,636
aren't in the direction
we're investing in.

660
00:34:16,876 --> 00:34:18,715
They lack Internet thinking.

661
00:34:18,715 --> 00:34:19,516
Besides,

662
00:34:19,715 --> 00:34:20,516
building a school

663
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:22,315
was a great way to develop
one's land in the last century.

664
00:34:22,595 --> 00:34:23,636
But to put it bluntly,

665
00:34:24,075 --> 00:34:25,595
it'll take a long time

666
00:34:25,595 --> 00:34:26,756
before we can gain profit from it.

667
00:34:29,715 --> 00:34:31,475
Great minds think alike indeed.

668
00:34:32,115 --> 00:34:34,115
We're implementing Internet thinking.

669
00:34:34,756 --> 00:34:35,756
The class is free.

670
00:34:35,996 --> 00:34:36,996
We attract talents first.

671
00:34:36,996 --> 00:34:38,435
We've invited many renowned figures

672
00:34:38,475 --> 00:34:40,156
to teach here.

673
00:34:40,235 --> 00:34:41,676
Once news of this gets out,

674
00:34:42,115 --> 00:34:42,955
those who wish

675
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:44,756
to join the TCM industry

676
00:34:44,996 --> 00:34:46,595
have to join us

677
00:34:46,595 --> 00:34:48,835
before they can establish
a foothold in the industry.

678
00:34:49,235 --> 00:34:50,955
We can brag about this shamelessly.

679
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,320
This is

680
00:34:52,355 --> 00:34:54,396
a business academy for TCM.

681
00:34:57,996 --> 00:34:59,195
Other business academies

682
00:34:59,195 --> 00:35:00,595
earn hundreds of thousands easily.

683
00:35:00,595 --> 00:35:01,996
But your academy is offering
classes for free.

684
00:35:02,235 --> 00:35:03,235
How could you compare yourself to them?

685
00:35:04,475 --> 00:35:05,796
When we're emotional,

686
00:35:06,756 --> 00:35:07,756
when we have hatred in our hearts,

687
00:35:08,115 --> 00:35:09,835
when we're frustrated,
what do you think we should do?

688
00:35:10,996 --> 00:35:11,852
Do you think you'll be fine

689
00:35:12,876 --> 00:35:14,475
after getting surgery
and taking medicine?

690
00:35:15,475 --> 00:35:17,075
Obviously, that won't work.

691
00:35:18,355 --> 00:35:19,475
What should we do then?

692
00:35:20,955 --> 00:35:23,235
According to the Doctrine of the Mean,

693
00:35:23,916 --> 00:35:26,396
when joy, anger, sorrow,
and pleasure have not yet arisen,

694
00:35:26,636 --> 00:35:27,676
it is called "moderate".

695
00:35:30,636 --> 00:35:31,595
But guys,

696
00:35:32,115 --> 00:35:34,036
we, humans, aren't

697
00:35:34,075 --> 00:35:35,475
deities in temples.

698
00:35:35,756 --> 00:35:37,876
When we have anger,

699
00:35:37,876 --> 00:35:39,276
we must vent it out.

700
00:35:40,115 --> 00:35:41,516
Here comes the latter part
of the saying.

701
00:35:42,115 --> 00:35:46,915
When they arise to their appropriate
levels, it is called "harmony".

702
00:35:48,076 --> 00:35:49,356
We already know

703
00:35:49,475 --> 00:35:51,875
that our emotions have deviated
from the central path.

704
00:35:52,475 --> 00:35:54,516
What should we do when it has
already harmed our bodies?

705
00:35:56,715 --> 00:35:58,195
There's still a way

706
00:35:58,715 --> 00:35:59,955
we can regulate our bodies.

707
00:35:59,955 --> 00:36:01,356
Next, we'll talk about

708
00:36:01,875 --> 00:36:04,875
how to regulate our unstable emotions.

709
00:36:06,596 --> 00:36:09,596
The Chinese culture relies on practice.

710
00:36:11,875 --> 00:36:12,875
Integrity needs practice.

711
00:36:14,875 --> 00:36:15,875
Morality needs to be instilled.

712
00:36:16,116 --> 00:36:19,356
If language does not transform one,

713
00:36:19,475 --> 00:36:21,195
there will be no culture.

714
00:36:23,475 --> 00:36:24,292
So, what do we transform?

715
00:36:25,235 --> 00:36:26,052
What do we transform?

716
00:36:28,395 --> 00:36:29,635
Guys, what do we transform?

717
00:36:29,635 --> 00:36:31,516
We transform our negative emotions.

718
00:36:32,155 --> 00:36:34,596
If someone has negative emotions,

719
00:36:34,596 --> 00:36:36,435
you must transform them
with your actions.

720
00:36:37,076 --> 00:36:39,516
Avoiding and procrastinating

721
00:36:40,076 --> 00:36:42,235
will harm your body severely.

722
00:36:47,756 --> 00:36:49,276
I think there's an issue

723
00:36:49,276 --> 00:36:50,276
with your mindset.

724
00:36:50,276 --> 00:36:51,875
I agree with Mr Liu.

725
00:36:52,316 --> 00:36:53,475
We have to attract traffic first.

726
00:36:53,756 --> 00:36:54,556
After that,

727
00:36:54,556 --> 00:36:56,195
you can continue
with the Internet thinking.

728
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:58,756
We'll earn money from
the surrounding businesses.

729
00:36:59,556 --> 00:37:00,715
The trading of herbs,

730
00:37:02,635 --> 00:37:03,556
online prescriptions,

731
00:37:03,796 --> 00:37:07,076
and the recommendation
between TCM and Western medicine,

732
00:37:07,635 --> 00:37:09,996
all of these will make huge money.

733
00:37:10,796 --> 00:37:12,836
The largest benefit of this academy

734
00:37:12,955 --> 00:37:13,772
is that

735
00:37:13,955 --> 00:37:16,675
it'll produce batches and batches
of new talents.

736
00:37:16,796 --> 00:37:17,715
That's right.

737
00:37:18,316 --> 00:37:19,516
This is a great concept.

738
00:37:19,516 --> 00:37:20,715
If we organise it,

739
00:37:20,715 --> 00:37:22,516
it'll be a complete proposal.

740
00:37:22,635 --> 00:37:24,596
The most valuable assets
in the TCM industry

741
00:37:24,836 --> 00:37:25,635
-are its people.
-That's right.

742
00:37:25,635 --> 00:37:27,076
As long as he's here,

743
00:37:27,235 --> 00:37:28,475
your industrial park

744
00:37:28,836 --> 00:37:29,836
will thrive.

745
00:37:29,836 --> 00:37:30,661
That's right.

746
00:37:33,596 --> 00:37:34,915
There's one more important point.

747
00:37:34,915 --> 00:37:36,356
We cannot talk about
the profit model first.

748
00:37:36,836 --> 00:37:38,076
Only small projects

749
00:37:38,195 --> 00:37:39,516
talk about their profit model
at the start.

750
00:37:39,955 --> 00:37:41,915
We have to talk about
visions and dreams.

751
00:37:42,155 --> 00:37:43,036
Just like Elon Musk.

752
00:37:43,036 --> 00:37:44,556
He talked about migrating to Mars
after he assumed his position.

753
00:37:44,556 --> 00:37:45,915
A world without borders.

754
00:37:46,316 --> 00:37:47,675
He made all those tycoons

755
00:37:47,675 --> 00:37:48,836
excited.

756
00:37:49,996 --> 00:37:51,276
When it comes to talking about dreams,

757
00:37:51,276 --> 00:37:52,516
Mr Liu, you're not the right fit.

758
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,680
Think about it.

759
00:37:53,715 --> 00:37:54,796
When you stand here,

760
00:37:54,796 --> 00:37:56,395
people will definitely think

761
00:37:56,395 --> 00:37:57,675
that the culture of your enterprise

762
00:37:58,036 --> 00:37:59,435
only focuses on profit,

763
00:37:59,435 --> 00:38:00,596
not dreams.

764
00:38:02,596 --> 00:38:03,915
Professor Ren is a great fit.

765
00:38:04,316 --> 00:38:06,076
If he comes to talk about his dreams,

766
00:38:06,276 --> 00:38:08,036
everyone in the world will be convinced.

767
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,525
What about this?

768
00:38:11,556 --> 00:38:13,276
We have a peer advisory board meeting
next month.

769
00:38:13,796 --> 00:38:14,955
You can invite Professor Ren

770
00:38:14,955 --> 00:38:16,036
to tell us

771
00:38:16,235 --> 00:38:17,516
about the vision of TCM development.

772
00:38:17,836 --> 00:38:19,915
As for the rest, we'll package them.

773
00:38:20,789 --> 00:38:23,269
This feels especially out of place.

774
00:38:23,836 --> 00:38:24,796
It's decided then.

775
00:38:26,796 --> 00:38:27,636
Let's go.

776
00:38:42,635 --> 00:38:44,036
Hello, Professor Ren?

777
00:38:44,356 --> 00:38:46,356
Today was supposed to
be your follow-up visit.

778
00:38:46,875 --> 00:38:47,836
I'm already done with my class.

779
00:38:47,955 --> 00:38:48,996
Why haven't you arrived yet?

780
00:38:50,475 --> 00:38:51,836
Actually, I was there.

781
00:38:54,596 --> 00:38:55,915
(I was at the classroom's door.)

782
00:38:56,316 --> 00:38:58,155
(I heard your lesson about emotion.)

783
00:38:58,796 --> 00:39:00,435
(I was suddenly enlightened.)

784
00:39:01,276 --> 00:39:03,475
(It feels like all of my troubles
has been lifted.)

785
00:39:04,195 --> 00:39:05,836
I feel like I'm cured.

786
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:08,492
Congratulations then.

787
00:39:09,875 --> 00:39:10,996
Thank you, Professor Ren.

788
00:39:30,316 --> 00:39:31,188
Grandson!

789
00:39:32,756 --> 00:39:33,556
I'm here!

790
00:39:35,036 --> 00:39:35,836
Where's the skateboard?

791
00:39:37,556 --> 00:39:38,556
Wait, where's the skateboard?

792
00:39:41,036 --> 00:39:42,076
You brought nothing?

793
00:39:42,875 --> 00:39:44,475
What? Are we here to eat?

794
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:45,684
Today,

795
00:39:46,875 --> 00:39:48,276
you shall acknowledge me
as your master first.

796
00:39:52,715 --> 00:39:54,235
What's wrong with you guys?

797
00:39:55,036 --> 00:39:56,036
Why do you guys like

798
00:39:56,036 --> 00:39:57,316
such ceremonies so much?

799
00:39:58,316 --> 00:39:59,435
Do you like it that much

800
00:39:59,435 --> 00:40:00,836
when people address you as Master?

801
00:40:00,836 --> 00:40:01,715
You're so childish.

802
00:40:02,796 --> 00:40:04,036
If you wish to travel
the pugilist world,

803
00:40:04,036 --> 00:40:05,955
you must get a famous master.

804
00:40:06,356 --> 00:40:08,195
Since I've already agreed to teach you,

805
00:40:08,276 --> 00:40:09,715
we need to make this official.

806
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:11,356
If not, what if you...

807
00:40:11,635 --> 00:40:14,316
If I do embarrass myself out there,

808
00:40:14,316 --> 00:40:16,076
I won't rat you out, okay?

809
00:40:16,076 --> 00:40:16,905
Deal.

810
00:40:20,356 --> 00:40:21,276
Deal.

811
00:40:22,036 --> 00:40:22,876
Alright.

812
00:40:24,276 --> 00:40:25,116
You're so troublesome.

813
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:26,556
What are you doing?

814
00:40:26,556 --> 00:40:28,235
We have to be particular
with the ceremony.

815
00:40:31,475 --> 00:40:32,427
Look.

816
00:40:32,756 --> 00:40:35,475
This is an excellent wine that
my grandfather has kept for a long time.

817
00:40:35,715 --> 00:40:37,036
It's definitely good.

818
00:40:39,155 --> 00:40:39,995
What do you think?

819
00:40:41,036 --> 00:40:42,596
Don't you think I'm nice?

820
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:46,635
I'm sure this has a huge kick then.

821
00:40:46,796 --> 00:40:48,036
Of course.

822
00:40:50,076 --> 00:40:50,893
You can stop craving for it.

823
00:40:51,796 --> 00:40:52,596
Go ahead.

824
00:40:55,395 --> 00:40:56,259
Rebecca.

825
00:40:56,875 --> 00:40:57,700
Rebecca,

826
00:40:57,796 --> 00:40:59,395
I don't think it's appropriate

827
00:40:59,395 --> 00:41:00,475
for us to just drink yogurt

828
00:41:00,475 --> 00:41:01,556
without ordering any food here.

829
00:41:02,715 --> 00:41:04,276
Can you please focus?

830
00:41:04,276 --> 00:41:05,556
My time is expensive.

831
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:09,195
You kept playing with those threads.

832
00:41:09,195 --> 00:41:10,836
How can I focus like this?

833
00:41:14,316 --> 00:41:15,125
I'm done.

834
00:41:17,116 --> 00:41:18,635
Does this shirt cost
tens of thousands as well

835
00:41:18,635 --> 00:41:19,516
when it looks this cheap?

836
00:41:21,756 --> 00:41:24,596
I ordered this from Taobao.

837
00:41:24,596 --> 00:41:26,155
It's meant for people
to wear to food stalls.

838
00:41:26,356 --> 00:41:27,596
It costs 55 yuan

839
00:41:27,596 --> 00:41:29,435
from top to bottom.
And, it's disposable.

840
00:41:29,556 --> 00:41:30,475
By the way,

841
00:41:30,475 --> 00:41:31,955
it's 80 yuan if you include

842
00:41:32,195 --> 00:41:33,316
this disposable bottle as well.

843
00:41:33,475 --> 00:41:34,996
What? You use Taobao too?

844
00:41:35,356 --> 00:41:36,796
I had no choice. You forced me to do it.

845
00:41:37,475 --> 00:41:38,516
That's pretty good.

846
00:41:38,635 --> 00:41:40,435
Share the link with me later.

847
00:41:43,516 --> 00:41:44,756
By the way, I have
something to tell you.

848
00:41:44,756 --> 00:41:46,635
The Dragon Boat Festival
is a public holiday.

849
00:41:46,955 --> 00:41:48,715
Our tuition class

850
00:41:48,715 --> 00:41:49,596
will be suspended for the time being.

851
00:41:49,836 --> 00:41:50,756
But why?

852
00:41:51,155 --> 00:41:52,235
Are you going on a trip?

853
00:41:52,955 --> 00:41:54,996
I'm going to join the TCM forum.

854
00:41:55,356 --> 00:41:56,796
But your name wasn't included

855
00:41:56,796 --> 00:41:57,635
in the name list.

856
00:41:57,796 --> 00:41:59,395
Besides, people won't invite

857
00:41:59,395 --> 00:42:01,116
half-baked physicians like us.

858
00:42:01,116 --> 00:42:02,116
This time,

859
00:42:02,635 --> 00:42:05,276
I'm going there because
the organiser invited me.

860
00:42:05,796 --> 00:42:07,635
What gives?
Why didn't he invite me then?

861
00:42:07,996 --> 00:42:10,276
The organiser is an

862
00:42:10,276 --> 00:42:11,235
old client of mine.

863
00:42:11,235 --> 00:42:13,435
I'm going there to visit him mainly.

864
00:42:13,435 --> 00:42:15,195
I'm just joining the forum
since I'll be there anyway.

865
00:42:16,875 --> 00:42:19,276
I think you're just going there
to join the forum.

866
00:42:20,276 --> 00:42:21,235
Take me with you.

867
00:42:22,116 --> 00:42:23,475
A spy like me

868
00:42:23,475 --> 00:42:25,756
needs to head to the enemy's nest
to eradicate them once and for all.

869
00:42:27,276 --> 00:42:28,316
Take me with you.

870
00:42:28,316 --> 00:42:29,195
You're a renowned figure.

871
00:42:29,195 --> 00:42:30,756
You need to have a servant beside you.

872
00:42:31,475 --> 00:42:32,556
Besides,

873
00:42:33,036 --> 00:42:34,715
the mountain path is rugged and uneven.

874
00:42:35,276 --> 00:42:36,316
I checked the schedule too.

875
00:42:36,316 --> 00:42:37,116
We have to gather mugwort

876
00:42:37,116 --> 00:42:38,036
in the mountains before dawn
on the second day.

877
00:42:38,036 --> 00:42:39,475
I'm sure you'll depart at night.

878
00:42:39,475 --> 00:42:40,836
What if you encounter a bear

879
00:42:40,836 --> 00:42:42,875
or a robber? It'll be dangerous.

880
00:42:43,596 --> 00:42:44,796
Most importantly,

881
00:42:46,316 --> 00:42:47,276
it's a long journey.

882
00:42:47,316 --> 00:42:49,715
You need a second driver somehow.

883
00:42:56,962 --> 00:42:58,171
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

884
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:00,106
(are referenced from relevant
traditional Chinese medicine books)

885
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,997
(Do not use without medical advice)
(End of Episode 9)
