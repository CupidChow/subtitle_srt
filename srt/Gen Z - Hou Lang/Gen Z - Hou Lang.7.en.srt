1
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,920
(Gen Z)

2
00:01:35,734 --> 00:01:37,734
(Episode 7)

3
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:42,040
We will continue with
the apprentice class on weekends.

4
00:01:44,279 --> 00:01:47,199
Am I going to do acupuncture
or prepare herbal medicine?

5
00:01:47,279 --> 00:01:48,079
You are sweeping the floor.

6
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,160
During this period,

7
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,199
we will invite influential teachers

8
00:01:56,516 --> 00:01:59,720
from different schools

9
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,759
and with different specialities

10
00:02:01,839 --> 00:02:02,999
to give you lectures.

11
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:04,999
We hope that everyone of you

12
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:07,240
can find out a field that you like

13
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,280
and is most suitable for you

14
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,879
during this learning period.

15
00:02:13,947 --> 00:02:14,947
You don't have a choice.

16
00:02:15,053 --> 00:02:16,372
You'll just have to follow me.

17
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,999
Mr Ren, my paid leave is over.

18
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,566
I have to return to
the hospital to work.

19
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,918
I will frequently take leave
from the apprentice class.

20
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:24,040
It's not a problem.

21
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,200
You and Xing Xing
are both healthcare workers.

22
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,679
The reason why I am teaching you
is because I hope that

23
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:32,360
you can apply TCM to your daily life.

24
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,280
Go on. Go back to work.

25
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,533
Shi Yan, for the classes you miss,

26
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,200
you can ask your classmates later
and make up for them.

27
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,080
Got it.

28
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,080
Tou,

29
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,958
you need surplus grain
to distribute porridge.

30
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,219
As for this saline-alkali land of
yours, you can keep it to yourself.

31
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:51,280
I'd better seek help from
our top-performing student, Ms Yang.

32
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,480
I'll trouble you with this
in the future.

33
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,520
Thank you in advance.

34
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,800
I have run out of surplus grain.

35
00:02:58,193 --> 00:03:00,106
You are a rich mine,
overflowing with wealth.

36
00:03:00,415 --> 00:03:01,360
Professor Ren.

37
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,559
Are they the mother and daughter
you told me about?

38
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:05,439
Yes, yes.

39
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,400
Zhu Xia and Ding Jian Xi.

40
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,280
-Hi.
-Professor Ren.

41
00:03:10,359 --> 00:03:11,919
Finally, we've been waiting for you.

42
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:14,059
Please help my daughter.

43
00:03:14,359 --> 00:03:16,399
If even you tell us that
it's hopeless,

44
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,740
then she can only stay
this way until she dies.

45
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,679
Don't talk about death all the time.

46
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,920
In this place,

47
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,080
it's not easy to die
even if you want to.

48
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,650
I've been briefed

49
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,479
about her condition.

50
00:03:28,767 --> 00:03:29,967
Let me take a look.

51
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,720
Come. Easy, easy.

52
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,360
Do you feel anything?

53
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,440
Her condition

54
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,040
is basically incurable.

55
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,093
Western doctors said that she would
stay this way for the rest of her life.

56
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,336
Professor Ren, if even you say

57
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,240
there is no way,

58
00:04:14,533 --> 00:04:15,333
then...

59
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:27,233
Don't worry.

60
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,480
There is a way.

61
00:04:32,027 --> 00:04:32,827
There is a way.

62
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,759
I just remembered that

63
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:37,280
there was this master
I apprenticed under before.

64
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,305
He taught me about

65
00:04:38,386 --> 00:04:39,799
bone resetting

66
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:42,480
and spinal rehabilitation.

67
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,120
I recall writing it down in a notebook.

68
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,436
Oh, right. There is a notebook
in my desk drawer.

69
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,440
Please get it for me.

70
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,640
That means my daughter's
condition is curable?

71
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,159
This medicine

72
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,840
might be difficult to find.

73
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,586
It's okay. Just tell me.

74
00:05:02,667 --> 00:05:03,520
I'll do everything

75
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,639
I can to find it.

76
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,560
Is it the one?

77
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,759
Let me see.

78
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,080
No peeking.

79
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,120
If you look without my permission,
you will get red eyes.

80
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,000
Go over there.

81
00:05:28,066 --> 00:05:29,026
This should be the one.

82
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,400
Tiles from the top of kitchen stove,

83
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,000
from an old house
that is over 300 years old,

84
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,440
soak it in child's urine

85
00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:40,640
for 21 days.

86
00:05:41,219 --> 00:05:43,579
Grind it into powder and
take it with the rice wine.

87
00:05:44,998 --> 00:05:46,399
Take... Take it?

88
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,560
You mean, drink it?

89
00:05:50,246 --> 00:05:52,086
Pee and tiles?

90
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:53,900
Amazing.

91
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,800
TCM practitioners
aren't afraid to bluff.

92
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,906
-I'll go and find it now.
-Mind your own business.

93
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:00,993
This should be the remedy.

94
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:02,479
But you know,

95
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,959
it's not easy to find houses that are

96
00:06:07,473 --> 00:06:08,673
over 300 years old nowadays.

97
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,040
There are so many places in the country.

98
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,480
I just need to find one.

99
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,456
I would find them

100
00:06:13,537 --> 00:06:15,457
even if I had to remove
the beams of the house.

101
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,359
You can't do that.

102
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,040
That's illegal.

103
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,160
You will get arrested.

104
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,773
-You know, I was arrested last time...
-Tou Tou...

105
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,566
Don't you have an appetite?
Why aren't you eating?

106
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,993
Quan, is something bothering you?

107
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,960
Why are you sighing?

108
00:06:49,359 --> 00:06:51,239
The dishes today aren't very appetizing.

109
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,100
What you make for us
is better than this.

110
00:06:55,172 --> 00:06:56,172
But it's healthy.

111
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,600
How about you ask Roubecca
to give you some of her salad?

112
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,560
Would you like some?

113
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,240
I was thinking about Ding Jian Xi
and her mother.

114
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,760
You also think that Mr Ren's remedy
is too far-fetched?

115
00:07:07,865 --> 00:07:09,786
I just feel bad for her parents.

116
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,640
She and her mum have to go through this.

117
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,199
If this happened on me,

118
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,479
my parents would probably faint on
the spot upon hearing the news.

119
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,760
Yes. It's true that
it's quite miserable.

120
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:24,439
Tian Zhen,

121
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,520
they are already so miserable.

122
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,560
How could your dad
still blatantly deceive them?

123
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,640
Listen to this.

124
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,840
He can cure a patient
with a completely broken spine

125
00:07:30,921 --> 00:07:33,560
by using 300-year-old tiles
and child's urine?

126
00:07:34,359 --> 00:07:35,399
This is not medicine,

127
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,760
it's witchcraft.

128
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,520
Never mind whether
it's medicine or witchcraft.

129
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,100
If it works, that's all that matters.

130
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,438
In traditional Chinese characters,
the character for

131
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:45,718
"medicine" originally had
the character for "shaman" below it.

132
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:46,839
Tian Zhen,

133
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,200
this is unlike you.

134
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,240
You have received
basic education in materialism.

135
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,360
What is the science in this?

136
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,560
Do you really believe

137
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,639
that paralysis can be cured with
300-year-old tiles and child's urine?

138
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,120
Yes, I believe it.

139
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:01,959
Otherwise, why do we have so few houses
that are over 300 years old

140
00:08:02,073 --> 00:08:02,993
compared to Europe?

141
00:08:04,507 --> 00:08:05,547
Do you TCM practitioners
all think like this?

142
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:07,919
In Li Shi Zhen's
"Compendium of Materia Medica",

143
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,400
he wrote that shoe sole mud,

144
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,320
manure pit mud,

145
00:08:10,403 --> 00:08:11,759
and foot-wrapping cloth
are all medicinal.

146
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,033
But look at the Westerners,

147
00:08:13,412 --> 00:08:15,002
they have Moscow Mathematical Papyrus,

148
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:16,463
Rhind Mathematical Papyrus,

149
00:08:16,544 --> 00:08:17,520
and later works like
Euclid's Elements

150
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,806
and The Art of Calculation.

151
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:20,719
I understand that acupuncture

152
00:08:20,799 --> 00:08:22,440
might work for spinal cord injuries,

153
00:08:22,688 --> 00:08:23,979
but this particular remedy

154
00:08:24,368 --> 00:08:25,569
sounds toxic.

155
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,278
How could it possibly be effective?

156
00:08:27,359 --> 00:08:29,680
This is the difference
between folk remedies

157
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,079
and actual science.

158
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,760
What does that mean?

159
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,079
Didn't Xin Zheng say it's curable?

160
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,486
How's acupuncture different from
taking medicine?

161
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,680
Tou, the spine

162
00:08:45,479 --> 00:08:46,760
is like this bone.

163
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,760
The vertebrae

164
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,520
are connected by ligaments,
muscles, and nerves.

165
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,760
This way, the central nervous system
in your brain

166
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,683
can transmit signals to
every part of your body,

167
00:08:55,764 --> 00:08:56,804
allowing you to run,

168
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,776
jump,

169
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,880
and feel sensations such as
cold, heat, and pain.

170
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,440
But Jian Xi,

171
00:09:03,479 --> 00:09:04,639
from her waist here,

172
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,600
it's broken.

173
00:09:08,199 --> 00:09:09,559
The bone is broken but the flesh
surrounding it remains intact.

174
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:12,000
Modern medicine is capable
of rejoining broken bones,

175
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,080
nerves,

176
00:09:13,307 --> 00:09:15,186
and even muscles.

177
00:09:15,533 --> 00:09:18,092
However, once the signal transmission
is interrupted,

178
00:09:18,239 --> 00:09:19,736
reconnecting it

179
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,000
is highly complex.

180
00:09:21,199 --> 00:09:23,360
Modern medicine has not yet
found a solution to this.

181
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,200
I may not

182
00:09:26,418 --> 00:09:27,858
fully understand neurology,

183
00:09:28,047 --> 00:09:29,087
but I think

184
00:09:29,446 --> 00:09:30,800
the regeneration of neurons

185
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,483
can be facilitated through methods
such as acupuncture and moxibustion,

186
00:09:33,564 --> 00:09:35,203
which involve repetitive stimulation.

187
00:09:35,479 --> 00:09:36,679
Such methods are likely to be effective.

188
00:09:37,253 --> 00:09:38,253
However, the idea

189
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,600
of simply consuming medication

190
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,119
can restore sensation

191
00:09:42,199 --> 00:09:43,119
to a paralysed person

192
00:09:43,199 --> 00:09:45,040
does not seem logically sound

193
00:09:45,479 --> 00:09:46,316
to me.

194
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,200
Rebecca,

195
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,120
great minds think alike.

196
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,200
Give me five.

197
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,120
Tian Zhen,

198
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:56,720
how confident do you think
Mr Ren is this time?

199
00:09:57,367 --> 00:09:58,687
I can't figure him out.

200
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:02,526
My dad said

201
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,679
that our ancestors
believed it to be effective.

202
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,560
Thank you.

203
00:10:18,613 --> 00:10:19,413
I think...

204
00:10:21,843 --> 00:10:23,359
I think you are cool.

205
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,640
You look cool when you work.

206
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,360
I think you look so cool
in everything

207
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,560
you do.

208
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,719
Don't you find it strange?
You are so handsome.

209
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,573
What you said is already
considered sexual harassment.

210
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,173
Seriously? This is sexual harassment
just because I complimented you?

211
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:45,320
I can't even compliment you now?

212
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,919
Now this is sexual harassment!

213
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,240
You...

214
00:11:05,239 --> 00:11:06,679
I'm sorry.

215
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:08,479
It's broken.

216
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:10,159
I stepped on it.

217
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,440
(Xu Jie)
I'm really sorry.

218
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,000
All right. No need for any explanations.

219
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,440
How do you want to solve this?

220
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,640
I will

221
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,239
compensate you.

222
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,080
I will pay you the money
you paid for this.

223
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,320
Over 10,000 yuan.

224
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,039
Over 10,000 yuan?

225
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,000
Hang on...

226
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,479
She will pay you back.

227
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:41,800
Don't worry, sir.

228
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,680
She will definitely pay you back for
these glasses at the original price.

229
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,580
It'll just cost her
three months' salaries.

230
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,600
Here's the thing, sir.

231
00:11:53,267 --> 00:11:54,546
Let me explain the logic here.

232
00:11:55,387 --> 00:11:57,267
All I did was
complimenting him just now.

233
00:11:57,347 --> 00:11:58,827
Is there anything wrong
with saying he looks cool?

234
00:11:58,907 --> 00:11:59,707
No, right?

235
00:11:59,907 --> 00:12:01,439
And he just turned around and hit me.

236
00:12:01,827 --> 00:12:03,627
I bumped into you because he hit me.

237
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,306
I wouldn't have done so
if he hadn't hit me.

238
00:12:05,387 --> 00:12:07,666
I wouldn't have stepped on your glasses
if he hadn't hit me.

239
00:12:07,746 --> 00:12:10,067
I wouldn't have had to pay you
back 10,000 yuan if he hadn't hit me.

240
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:11,987
Am I right?
So, he's responsible for this.

241
00:12:12,067 --> 00:12:13,173
Ask him to pay you back.

242
00:12:13,587 --> 00:12:14,546
He's rich.

243
00:12:14,626 --> 00:12:16,827
This big medical centre
belongs to his family.

244
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,039
He's a son from a rich family.

245
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,199
He's got lots of money,

246
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,080
you know?

247
00:12:20,626 --> 00:12:21,638
What are you looking at?

248
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,679
That's right.
I'm moral blackmailing you.

249
00:12:24,626 --> 00:12:26,226
You are Professor Ren's son?

250
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:29,587
I am. And you are?

251
00:12:31,387 --> 00:12:32,986
You saved my daughter.

252
00:12:33,387 --> 00:12:34,507
I'm Xu Meng's father.

253
00:12:37,827 --> 00:12:38,867
Do you remember Xu Meng?

254
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,960
How is she doing now?

255
00:12:41,267 --> 00:12:42,067
Not really good.

256
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:45,006
Do you still want us
to pay you back for the glasses?

257
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,760
She lost her sanity?

258
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:50,813
She lost her sanity?

259
00:12:54,067 --> 00:12:56,867
Meng Meng has always been
well behaved since she was young.

260
00:12:56,947 --> 00:12:58,067
As her parents,

261
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,120
we haven't had to worry much
about her life and studies.

262
00:13:00,186 --> 00:13:04,067
Perhaps we've been too overprotective
of her since she was little.

263
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:06,106
She just can't tell right from wrong,

264
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,482
so she was tricked by a boy.

265
00:13:08,563 --> 00:13:10,307
Do you know this boy?

266
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,160
No. She wouldn't tell us.

267
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,412
Her mother and I have been too busy
with our work.

268
00:13:16,267 --> 00:13:17,067
Actually,

269
00:13:17,827 --> 00:13:18,987
we only learned about this

270
00:13:19,067 --> 00:13:20,347
a little earlier than you did.

271
00:13:20,587 --> 00:13:22,019
I'm sure you didn't ask her before.

272
00:13:22,267 --> 00:13:25,006
Maybe she had mentioned it,
and you just didn't pay attention to it.

273
00:13:28,267 --> 00:13:29,106
Mr Xu,

274
00:13:29,387 --> 00:13:32,106
you said Meng Meng
had some new issues lately.

275
00:13:32,387 --> 00:13:33,827
Would you mind elaborating it?

276
00:13:35,707 --> 00:13:37,226
She broke down.

277
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,746
Before, she had
a very gentle personality

278
00:13:40,493 --> 00:13:41,706
and was very kind to people.

279
00:13:41,907 --> 00:13:43,067
But now she seems
to have only two states,

280
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,080
either she snaps at people
or she resorts to violence.

281
00:13:46,147 --> 00:13:47,106
Resorts to violence?

282
00:13:48,067 --> 00:13:49,947
She smashed everything in the house.

283
00:13:50,347 --> 00:13:52,867
Now I can't have anything
sharp, pointed,

284
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,986
or with blades in the house.
I put all our knives and forks away.

285
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:55,867
To be honest,

286
00:13:56,387 --> 00:13:57,827
I can't even cook at home now.

287
00:13:57,907 --> 00:13:59,067
I can only order takeout.

288
00:14:00,067 --> 00:14:03,507
Have you tried going to other hospitals?

289
00:14:05,626 --> 00:14:06,467
We took her

290
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,040
to the Fourth Hospital
once before.

291
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,226
They administered electroconvulsive
therapy (ECT) to her there.

292
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,000
ECT?

293
00:14:15,947 --> 00:14:18,226
You know, after that session of ECT,

294
00:14:18,947 --> 00:14:19,747
she became

295
00:14:20,544 --> 00:14:21,500
even more distressed.

296
00:14:23,387 --> 00:14:24,387
You know,

297
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,073
now she won't talk anymore

298
00:14:26,306 --> 00:14:27,626
and has become unwilling to move.

299
00:14:27,707 --> 00:14:29,027
She even refused to go to school.

300
00:14:32,827 --> 00:14:34,866
I'm at my wits' end now, Dr Ren.

301
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:38,267
After thinking about it, I thought
since you saved her life,

302
00:14:38,513 --> 00:14:40,032
I could only come to you

303
00:14:40,252 --> 00:14:41,465
and ask for your help again.

304
00:14:41,946 --> 00:14:42,746
I mean it.

305
00:14:43,587 --> 00:14:44,626
She's my only daughter.

306
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,400
Professor Ren,

307
00:14:46,907 --> 00:14:48,387
please do whatever you can

308
00:14:49,147 --> 00:14:50,426
to save my girl.

309
00:14:50,907 --> 00:14:52,507
Money isn't a problem.

310
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,066
If money could really solve the problem,
you wouldn't be here.

311
00:14:56,147 --> 00:14:56,947
Tian Zhen.

312
00:15:03,507 --> 00:15:04,307
How about this?

313
00:15:05,267 --> 00:15:06,626
We will go take a look at her.

314
00:15:08,067 --> 00:15:08,867
No problem.

315
00:15:11,626 --> 00:15:12,426
Where is Cai Qing?

316
00:15:12,707 --> 00:15:15,160
Madam received a phone call
and hurriedly went out.

317
00:15:15,507 --> 00:15:16,947
She left Meng Meng alone again.

318
00:15:34,707 --> 00:15:35,507
Meng Meng.

319
00:15:37,267 --> 00:15:38,067
Meng Meng.

320
00:15:39,827 --> 00:15:41,427
Meng Meng, you will get a cold
with your bare feet.

321
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:42,347
Wear your slippers.

322
00:15:43,387 --> 00:15:44,187
Meng Meng!

323
00:15:45,827 --> 00:15:46,627
Meng Meng.

324
00:15:57,587 --> 00:15:58,507
Meng Meng.

325
00:15:58,746 --> 00:15:59,666
Meng Meng.

326
00:16:01,186 --> 00:16:02,666
I'm Dr Song.

327
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,081
Do you remember me?

328
00:16:15,067 --> 00:16:16,387
I'm Dr Song.

329
00:16:20,507 --> 00:16:22,426
We met in the hospital before.

330
00:16:23,027 --> 00:16:24,186
I'm Dr Song.

331
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:29,387
It's okay.

332
00:16:29,587 --> 00:16:30,666
You are okay now.

333
00:16:30,746 --> 00:16:31,627
It's okay.

334
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,079
It's okay.

335
00:16:33,238 --> 00:16:34,359
It's okay.

336
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,240
It's okay.

337
00:16:38,626 --> 00:16:39,426
Mr Xu,

338
00:16:39,746 --> 00:16:41,306
please leave us the room.

339
00:16:41,587 --> 00:16:43,586
My husband and I would like
to talk to her alone.

340
00:16:44,626 --> 00:16:45,623
I will leave her to you.

341
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,040
It's all right now.

342
00:16:49,267 --> 00:16:50,067
You are safe now.

343
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,719
You are safe.

344
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,340
Come.

345
00:16:56,027 --> 00:16:57,267
Let me

346
00:16:57,587 --> 00:16:59,827
take a look at you.

347
00:17:02,067 --> 00:17:02,867
Let's see.

348
00:17:04,186 --> 00:17:04,986
Let's see.

349
00:17:06,947 --> 00:17:09,067
You are still so pretty

350
00:17:09,147 --> 00:17:11,147
and good-looking as before.

351
00:17:12,387 --> 00:17:13,187
Du Cai Qing,

352
00:17:13,467 --> 00:17:14,587
didn't we agree on this?

353
00:17:14,947 --> 00:17:16,747
One of us has to stay at home

354
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:17,980
and look after Meng Meng.

355
00:17:18,947 --> 00:17:19,747
The helper?

356
00:17:19,947 --> 00:17:21,267
How will she be able to help?

357
00:17:22,267 --> 00:17:24,387
Why did you have to leave today?

358
00:17:25,067 --> 00:17:27,879
It's just a stupid exhibition.
Is it a meeting even necessary?

359
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,080
Me?

360
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,739
I even postponed my work for this.

361
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,480
Listen to me,

362
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,960
if nothing happens to Meng Meng,
then it's fine.

363
00:17:35,027 --> 00:17:37,199
But if something happens to her,
I won't forgive you!

364
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,321
Your hands are a little cold.

365
00:17:46,027 --> 00:17:46,827
Right?

366
00:17:47,626 --> 00:17:49,147
Why are your hands so cold?

367
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,841
May I read your pulse?

368
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:54,827
Your hands are so cold.

369
00:17:56,707 --> 00:17:57,707
It's okay.

370
00:17:58,387 --> 00:17:59,546
It's okay.

371
00:18:05,947 --> 00:18:07,186
Her Cunkou pulse is tight.

372
00:18:11,827 --> 00:18:14,067
Meng Meng, you shouldn't
walk around barefoot.

373
00:18:14,587 --> 00:18:15,746
Come on, sit on the bed.

374
00:18:16,147 --> 00:18:17,387
Sit on the bed.

375
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,520
Come on. Easy.

376
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,480
Good.

377
00:18:26,507 --> 00:18:27,947
Professor Ren, sorry about that.

378
00:18:28,027 --> 00:18:29,746
We are not usually like this.

379
00:18:30,347 --> 00:18:31,387
Her mother really
had an emergency today,

380
00:18:31,467 --> 00:18:34,267
otherwise she wouldn't have
left our sick child alone.

381
00:18:34,347 --> 00:18:35,707
Yes, I understand.

382
00:18:35,986 --> 00:18:37,147
But your daughter

383
00:18:38,106 --> 00:18:38,947
isn't sick.

384
00:18:39,987 --> 00:18:41,067
She isn't sick.

385
00:18:41,266 --> 00:18:42,066
Professor Ren,

386
00:18:42,587 --> 00:18:44,426
you saw her with your own eyes just now.

387
00:18:44,605 --> 00:18:45,405
Yes.

388
00:18:45,867 --> 00:18:47,147
After what your daughter
has been through,

389
00:18:47,227 --> 00:18:49,306
she is allowed
to have a stress response.

390
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:51,627
So,

391
00:18:52,107 --> 00:18:54,426
her condition isn't as serious
as you think it is.

392
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:58,386
In TCM, this can be described
as Qi stagnation and blood stasis.

393
00:18:58,987 --> 00:19:00,726
It can be treated by regulating
the liver and spleen.

394
00:19:02,347 --> 00:19:03,227
Is it that simple?

395
00:19:04,467 --> 00:19:05,753
Just a few doses of medicine,
and she will be fine.

396
00:19:06,107 --> 00:19:08,026
Lift your legs.

397
00:19:08,627 --> 00:19:11,107
Yes. Lift this up too.

398
00:19:11,987 --> 00:19:14,787
Let's cover them up.

399
00:19:14,867 --> 00:19:15,667
Immediately,

400
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,666
your feet won't be cold anymore.

401
00:19:17,747 --> 00:19:18,587
Right?

402
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,600
You and your wife have to join
the treatment with your daughter.

403
00:19:34,587 --> 00:19:35,787
-We have to join it?
-That's right.

404
00:19:35,867 --> 00:19:37,306
-Both of us?
-Yes.

405
00:19:37,386 --> 00:19:38,186
What for?

406
00:19:38,587 --> 00:19:40,220
Parents and daughter share a deep bond.

407
00:19:40,506 --> 00:19:41,707
So, to cure her condition,

408
00:19:42,067 --> 00:19:44,587
your whole family should
participate in the treatment together.

409
00:19:55,107 --> 00:19:56,386
From what you just said,

410
00:19:56,947 --> 00:19:58,867
it seems that both of
these girls' conditions

411
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,121
are difficult to treat.

412
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,480
I feel really

413
00:20:04,707 --> 00:20:05,707
frustrated today.

414
00:20:05,987 --> 00:20:06,787
They are both

415
00:20:07,467 --> 00:20:09,747
beautiful young ladies.

416
00:20:09,987 --> 00:20:10,787
Yes.

417
00:20:12,467 --> 00:20:13,267
Actually,

418
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:15,747
the greatest filial piety a child

419
00:20:15,987 --> 00:20:17,306
can show to their parents

420
00:20:18,067 --> 00:20:19,747
is to stay healthy

421
00:20:19,827 --> 00:20:21,186
and free from illness or harm.

422
00:20:21,266 --> 00:20:22,066
Right?

423
00:20:22,467 --> 00:20:23,267
We can

424
00:20:24,467 --> 00:20:26,587
focus on the girl

425
00:20:26,867 --> 00:20:28,747
with ectopic pregnancy.

426
00:20:29,067 --> 00:20:31,919
She has acute abdominal pain,
which is relatively easier to deal with.

427
00:20:33,227 --> 00:20:34,027
Dad,

428
00:20:34,707 --> 00:20:35,867
I think

429
00:20:36,947 --> 00:20:38,627
Xu Meng's condition is more challenging

430
00:20:40,107 --> 00:20:41,666
to treat compared to Ding Jian Xi's.

431
00:20:42,146 --> 00:20:43,826
For Ding Jian Xi,

432
00:20:43,906 --> 00:20:46,347
the purpose of prescribing medication
is to give her hope.

433
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,204
(Jiangzhou People's Hospital)

434
00:20:50,467 --> 00:20:51,786
How do you handle patients?

435
00:20:51,987 --> 00:20:53,867
Haven't you noticed that my mother
has been waiting for 40 minutes?

436
00:20:53,947 --> 00:20:55,066
Don't you have a mother?

437
00:20:55,146 --> 00:20:57,627
I'm telling you, if you don't examine
my mother today,

438
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,800
I will make things difficult for you.

439
00:20:58,867 --> 00:21:01,387
Why is a grown man like you
bullying a young nurse?

440
00:21:01,467 --> 00:21:03,627
She hasn't been idled
during these 40 minutes.

441
00:21:03,707 --> 00:21:04,627
What do you know?

442
00:21:04,707 --> 00:21:06,426
His mother has been suffering from
gastric bloating for about ten days.

443
00:21:06,506 --> 00:21:07,306
But this nurse just told her

444
00:21:07,386 --> 00:21:08,867
to go to the outpatient department
tomorrow morning.

445
00:21:08,947 --> 00:21:09,946
It does sound improper.

446
00:21:10,026 --> 00:21:11,018
Can't you talk nicely?

447
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,640
All of them are busy.

448
00:21:12,707 --> 00:21:15,947
She just saved a child who was choking
on a glutinous rice ball a while ago.

449
00:21:16,186 --> 00:21:17,907
She didn't neglect them.

450
00:21:17,987 --> 00:21:19,426
Like I told you before,

451
00:21:19,506 --> 00:21:21,186
the emergency department is
meant for life-threatening situations.

452
00:21:21,386 --> 00:21:23,346
Gastric bloating for over ten days
is not considered an emergency.

453
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,065
It's more proper for you to visit
the outpatient department tomorrow.

454
00:21:25,146 --> 00:21:26,666
You're just a nurse. What do you know?

455
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,010
If something happens to my mother,

456
00:21:28,091 --> 00:21:29,171
will you be able
to take responsibility for it?

457
00:21:29,266 --> 00:21:31,547
You didn't perform any tests
and just asked us to leave.

458
00:21:31,627 --> 00:21:32,586
-That's right.
-I won't have this.

459
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,291
You have to perform tests
on my mum today.

460
00:21:34,372 --> 00:21:36,466
Or I won't let you do your work.

461
00:21:36,546 --> 00:21:38,906
That's right. We won't let you work.

462
00:21:41,347 --> 00:21:42,706
-Come here!
-Let go.

463
00:21:42,786 --> 00:21:43,867
Examine my mum!

464
00:21:43,947 --> 00:21:44,906
Examine my mum!

465
00:21:45,227 --> 00:21:47,347
Let go of me. Use words.

466
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:50,106
Who are you? What are you doing?

467
00:21:50,186 --> 00:21:51,507
Call the cops!

468
00:21:51,587 --> 00:21:52,906
What did you say? Call the cops?

469
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:54,226
Yes, call the cops now.

470
00:21:54,306 --> 00:21:56,072
-Who are you?
-Who am I? Let me tell you...

471
00:21:56,707 --> 00:21:57,839
Hello, police?

472
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,740
All the nurses here
are under my protection.

473
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,913
What's wrong with you people?

474
00:22:02,426 --> 00:22:04,978
Don't you know that the emergency
room is a place to save lives?

475
00:22:06,786 --> 00:22:07,586
What's the matter?

476
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,560
Don't you know how to wait in line?

477
00:22:09,653 --> 00:22:10,853
Don't you have any manners?

478
00:22:11,827 --> 00:22:12,707
Listen,

479
00:22:12,906 --> 00:22:16,186
show more respect when speaking
to healthcare workers in the future,

480
00:22:16,266 --> 00:22:17,066
understood?

481
00:22:21,306 --> 00:22:22,106
I mean,

482
00:22:24,306 --> 00:22:25,498
why can't you wait in line?

483
00:22:26,067 --> 00:22:26,867
Right?

484
00:22:27,026 --> 00:22:28,867
There are so many people
in the emergency room.

485
00:22:29,906 --> 00:22:31,026
Your mother looks fine,

486
00:22:31,426 --> 00:22:32,747
She looks healthy,

487
00:22:32,947 --> 00:22:33,747
right?

488
00:22:33,947 --> 00:22:35,107
I'm talking to them.

489
00:22:35,707 --> 00:22:37,747
Show some respect to...

490
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:38,760
What?

491
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:41,466
I was educating him.

492
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,400
Understood?

493
00:22:46,652 --> 00:22:47,652
Understood, guys?

494
00:22:52,146 --> 00:22:52,947
Don't worry.

495
00:22:57,186 --> 00:22:58,978
We went to visit Xu Meng
at her home today.

496
00:22:59,266 --> 00:23:01,627
She pushes her parents away,

497
00:23:02,266 --> 00:23:04,786
but she is willing
to let us get close to her.

498
00:23:05,627 --> 00:23:07,627
Actually, her parents
love her very much,

499
00:23:08,245 --> 00:23:09,485
but I can feel that

500
00:23:09,732 --> 00:23:11,293
she holds resentment

501
00:23:11,426 --> 00:23:12,707
towards them.

502
00:23:13,146 --> 00:23:14,306
This resentment

503
00:23:15,186 --> 00:23:16,586
has led her to corrupt herself

504
00:23:16,666 --> 00:23:17,666
and give up on herself.

505
00:23:18,306 --> 00:23:19,426
I'm afraid

506
00:23:19,506 --> 00:23:20,666
that one day

507
00:23:21,252 --> 00:23:23,092
she might reach a breaking point

508
00:23:23,306 --> 00:23:25,067
and kill herself
by jumping off a building.

509
00:23:25,753 --> 00:23:26,952
Is it that serious?

510
00:23:28,186 --> 00:23:29,186
Do her parents

511
00:23:29,426 --> 00:23:30,707
keep her company?

512
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,000
They are both busy.

513
00:23:34,426 --> 00:23:36,346
Their way of loving their child

514
00:23:36,426 --> 00:23:37,386
is incorrect.

515
00:23:37,985 --> 00:23:39,066
Mum, you know,

516
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,841
her mother installed

517
00:23:41,026 --> 00:23:43,306
numerous surveillance cameras
throughout the house,

518
00:23:43,386 --> 00:23:45,627
monitoring her every move.

519
00:23:47,906 --> 00:23:50,027
Their house

520
00:23:50,107 --> 00:23:51,506
really looks like

521
00:23:52,026 --> 00:23:53,106
a model house,

522
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:55,019
luxurious and grand.

523
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,960
But for that child,

524
00:23:57,026 --> 00:23:58,226
living there is like

525
00:23:58,306 --> 00:23:59,546
living in a luxurious birdcage.

526
00:23:59,707 --> 00:24:00,787
A love like this

527
00:24:00,936 --> 00:24:02,226
suffocates her.

528
00:24:02,306 --> 00:24:03,827
They are bound to have issues.

529
00:24:04,906 --> 00:24:07,747
However, their illnesses
need to be treated together.

530
00:24:07,827 --> 00:24:09,386
Ask her parents come over

531
00:24:09,786 --> 00:24:12,107
I will perform a set of
Five Elements Acupuncture for her.

532
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,159
Emotions and mental state
need to be addressed as well.

533
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,240
Mum,

534
00:24:16,627 --> 00:24:19,276
Xin Zheng told her father
about that today,

535
00:24:19,627 --> 00:24:20,827
but he said

536
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:22,972
he's going on a business trip soon.

537
00:24:23,913 --> 00:24:26,112
He will stay abroad for two months.

538
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,600
They are not proactive
to get her treated.

539
00:24:30,666 --> 00:24:31,466
They may

540
00:24:32,146 --> 00:24:34,466
speak of their child
as their precious darling,

541
00:24:34,546 --> 00:24:35,786
but their actions

542
00:24:36,492 --> 00:24:37,693
contradict their words.

543
00:24:39,426 --> 00:24:41,226
If he truly loves his child,

544
00:24:41,306 --> 00:24:42,906
he should follow
the doctor's advice completely.

545
00:24:43,186 --> 00:24:44,386
With his lack of cooperation,

546
00:24:45,146 --> 00:24:47,205
even if I possess
extraordinary medical skills,

547
00:24:47,707 --> 00:24:49,426
it will be difficult to save her life.

548
00:24:52,666 --> 00:24:53,466
I just made this.

549
00:24:54,146 --> 00:24:54,946
It's still warm.

550
00:24:56,827 --> 00:24:57,707
Sorry.

551
00:24:58,546 --> 00:24:59,346
Try it.

552
00:25:03,786 --> 00:25:04,586
It's good, right?

553
00:25:05,786 --> 00:25:06,599
It is good.

554
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,759
You've gotten better.

555
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,041
I say,

556
00:25:11,306 --> 00:25:13,266
why do you always make a scene
everywhere you go?

557
00:25:13,546 --> 00:25:14,947
Look at what you just did.

558
00:25:15,266 --> 00:25:16,605
Do you want to go to jail again?

559
00:25:20,426 --> 00:25:21,426
Tian Xing Xing,

560
00:25:21,546 --> 00:25:22,826
have a conscience.

561
00:25:22,906 --> 00:25:24,226
I was standing up for you.

562
00:25:24,366 --> 00:25:25,166
All right.

563
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,080
Fine.

564
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:29,426
I won't step in to help you next time.
I'll just stand by and watch.

565
00:25:30,067 --> 00:25:30,946
With you around,

566
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,200
no one dares to bully me.

567
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,039
I'm telling you, it's because of you

568
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,298
that I still don't have a boyfriend now.

569
00:25:35,379 --> 00:25:37,106
What do you need a boyfriend for?

570
00:25:37,186 --> 00:25:39,586
I mean, if you get a boyfriend,
and he bullies you,

571
00:25:39,752 --> 00:25:41,673
I will still have to teach him a lesson.

572
00:25:46,666 --> 00:25:48,627
The key now is

573
00:25:48,707 --> 00:25:51,466
Meng Meng needs to

574
00:25:51,546 --> 00:25:53,826
break free from the circle
she has drawn

575
00:25:53,906 --> 00:25:54,906
around herself.

576
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,640
She needs to regain
confidence and dignity.

577
00:25:58,812 --> 00:26:00,106
Dad, Mum,

578
00:26:00,186 --> 00:26:02,252
let her come to our medical centre.
I'll help you.

579
00:26:02,666 --> 00:26:05,066
If she can't go to school now,
let her join the apprentice class.

580
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,345
I will guide her in her study.

581
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,465
If her parents are busy,
she can stay at our place.

582
00:26:08,546 --> 00:26:09,579
I will take care of her.

583
00:26:11,186 --> 00:26:12,666
If we do that,

584
00:26:13,186 --> 00:26:14,706
do you know how great the risks are?

585
00:26:14,786 --> 00:26:15,586
Yes.

586
00:26:16,186 --> 00:26:17,738
She is my patient in the first place.

587
00:26:18,146 --> 00:26:20,599
Last time, it was because of my mistake
that she almost died.

588
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,899
This time, I must take
full responsibility for her.

589
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,480
No.

590
00:26:27,186 --> 00:26:28,146
Your dad is right.

591
00:26:28,627 --> 00:26:29,827
This is a huge responsibility.

592
00:26:30,786 --> 00:26:32,706
None of us

593
00:26:32,786 --> 00:26:34,306
can keep an eye on her every second.

594
00:26:34,546 --> 00:26:36,338
What if something unexpected
happens to her?

595
00:26:38,546 --> 00:26:39,426
How are we going
to answer to her parents?

596
00:26:39,506 --> 00:26:41,546
Mum, King of Medicine,
Sun Si Miao, once said

597
00:26:41,786 --> 00:26:43,267
that when someone seeks help
for their illness or adversity,

598
00:26:43,386 --> 00:26:44,945
we must not inquire about
their social status or wealth.

599
00:26:45,146 --> 00:26:46,546
All beings are equal.

600
00:26:46,666 --> 00:26:47,906
Our knowledge and action
must be the same.

601
00:26:48,067 --> 00:26:49,587
These are different matters.

602
00:26:51,786 --> 00:26:52,826
How does this girl

603
00:26:52,906 --> 00:26:53,827
look like?

604
00:26:54,627 --> 00:26:55,427
Dad...

605
00:26:57,906 --> 00:26:59,426
From what you've just said,

606
00:26:59,786 --> 00:27:03,106
it seems that this young lady
is both wealthy and beautiful.

607
00:27:03,186 --> 00:27:04,306
Your intentions

608
00:27:04,666 --> 00:27:06,306
are good,

609
00:27:06,386 --> 00:27:08,666
but people may misunderstand that

610
00:27:09,067 --> 00:27:10,227
you have ulterior motives.

611
00:27:11,266 --> 00:27:12,066
Grandpa.

612
00:27:14,593 --> 00:27:15,752
Now he's mad at me.

613
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,440
Hello?

614
00:27:27,666 --> 00:27:28,786
She got arrested again?

615
00:27:44,906 --> 00:27:48,106
Who told me that
she won't involve her master

616
00:27:48,186 --> 00:27:49,506
after committing a wrongdoing?

617
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,680
Who?

618
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,040
No, I mean,

619
00:27:53,952 --> 00:27:55,552
I acted bravely

620
00:27:55,827 --> 00:27:56,947
and did a righteous deed

621
00:27:57,266 --> 00:27:58,546
today.

622
00:27:59,266 --> 00:28:01,026
It's a matter of honour for me.

623
00:28:01,546 --> 00:28:04,627
I'm bringing you along
to share in this glory, you know?

624
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,945
Go home and pack your stuff.

625
00:28:06,058 --> 00:28:07,072
You are staying with us.

626
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,000
Staying with...

627
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,080
No.

628
00:28:13,386 --> 00:28:14,186
No way.

629
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,960
Why should I stay with you?

630
00:28:17,026 --> 00:28:17,946
They...

631
00:28:18,026 --> 00:28:19,186
They, they, they.

632
00:28:19,506 --> 00:28:20,787
They are they, you are you.

633
00:28:22,452 --> 00:28:23,452
Let me tell you,

634
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,600
you must be under my surveillance

635
00:28:25,666 --> 00:28:27,306
24 hours a day.

636
00:28:27,386 --> 00:28:28,306
Do you know why?

637
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,858
Helping you become a successor

638
00:28:31,146 --> 00:28:32,546
is an assignment

639
00:28:32,947 --> 00:28:34,066
given to me by my master.

640
00:28:34,146 --> 00:28:35,186
Please don't

641
00:28:35,666 --> 00:28:38,146
give me any extra assignments.

642
00:28:38,506 --> 00:28:39,666
I can't afford to

643
00:28:40,106 --> 00:28:41,386
pay more compensations.

644
00:28:41,506 --> 00:28:43,546
You didn't have to pay a lot today.

645
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,160
I...

646
00:28:46,258 --> 00:28:47,378
Hang on, Master.

647
00:28:47,627 --> 00:28:48,427
Master,

648
00:28:48,707 --> 00:28:49,586
if I...

649
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,080
If I don't go back, my best friend...

650
00:28:51,159 --> 00:28:54,078
She will think I've gone missing.

651
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:55,466
Master!

652
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,280
Don't you know how many rooms we have?

653
00:29:03,966 --> 00:29:05,047
Other people

654
00:29:05,546 --> 00:29:07,587
bring home dogs or cats,

655
00:29:07,786 --> 00:29:09,146
while you and your son

656
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,559
bring home people.

657
00:29:14,958 --> 00:29:17,239
With two more people living here,
I have to do more chores.

658
00:29:18,947 --> 00:29:20,107
Both of you

659
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:22,620
only throw your hands up,
leaving all the jobs for me.

660
00:29:23,026 --> 00:29:24,426
They are big girls.

661
00:29:24,506 --> 00:29:25,698
You don't need to serve them.

662
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:27,805
They can take care of themselves.

663
00:29:28,707 --> 00:29:29,507
Both of

664
00:29:29,827 --> 00:29:30,627
these girls

665
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,280
are worrisome.

666
00:29:33,026 --> 00:29:34,805
You said they can
take care of themselves.

667
00:29:35,186 --> 00:29:36,666
But I still have to

668
00:29:37,186 --> 00:29:38,186
worry about them.

669
00:29:38,266 --> 00:29:39,896
I have my reasons,

670
00:29:39,977 --> 00:29:41,497
asking Tou Tou to stay with us.

671
00:29:42,026 --> 00:29:43,106
Look at Meng Meng,

672
00:29:43,186 --> 00:29:45,345
she needs someone
to keep an eye on her all the time.

673
00:29:45,906 --> 00:29:48,226
Who can keep an eye on her
when she sleeps at night?

674
00:29:48,306 --> 00:29:51,306
Who in our family
can accompany her all the time?

675
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:52,747
With Tou Tou around,

676
00:29:53,546 --> 00:29:54,786
they can look after each other.

677
00:29:55,146 --> 00:29:55,947
Sun Tou Tou

678
00:29:56,666 --> 00:29:57,627
has been arrested twice.

679
00:29:58,186 --> 00:29:59,425
And you want to count on her?

680
00:30:00,146 --> 00:30:02,386
I'm with Tou Tou this time.

681
00:30:03,306 --> 00:30:05,125
It's true that
she shouldn't have hit people,

682
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,600
but she was in the right.

683
00:30:12,067 --> 00:30:12,867
All right.

684
00:30:13,386 --> 00:30:14,707
I will move this there for you.

685
00:30:15,906 --> 00:30:16,706
You

686
00:30:17,026 --> 00:30:18,906
don't have the strength to carry stuff.

687
00:30:19,186 --> 00:30:20,786
You might hurt yourself again.

688
00:30:21,067 --> 00:30:22,267
You never consult with me

689
00:30:22,347 --> 00:30:23,546
before doing anything.

690
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,479
I know you are a reasonable person.

691
00:30:27,026 --> 00:30:28,666
If we let Tou Tou stay outside,

692
00:30:29,506 --> 00:30:31,705
we will have to make compensation
when she commits wrongdoing.

693
00:30:31,786 --> 00:30:33,605
The money still comes
from your pocket, right?

694
00:30:35,546 --> 00:30:37,067
What does it mean

695
00:30:37,306 --> 00:30:39,146
to follow a master?

696
00:30:39,386 --> 00:30:41,019
What we pursue isn't just knowledge,

697
00:30:41,707 --> 00:30:43,466
but like-mindedness.

698
00:30:43,546 --> 00:30:45,026
Look, I even married you

699
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,239
to be closer to my master.

700
00:30:48,283 --> 00:30:49,506
I ensured that

701
00:30:49,786 --> 00:30:51,426
I live under the same roof as my master.

702
00:30:51,506 --> 00:30:52,306
You see,

703
00:30:52,546 --> 00:30:53,547
if I'm teaching through
words and deeds,

704
00:30:53,627 --> 00:30:55,546
I need a recipient for it, don't I?

705
00:30:57,026 --> 00:30:58,146
Ren Xin Zheng.

706
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:02,266
You called me by my full name.

707
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:04,026
I think you're mad for real now.

708
00:31:05,546 --> 00:31:06,426
I'm sorry.

709
00:31:07,306 --> 00:31:08,106
Sorry.

710
00:31:10,146 --> 00:31:11,546
Tell me what you did wrong.

711
00:31:13,426 --> 00:31:14,666
This is the fourth

712
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,440
major philosophical question in life.

713
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,376
(The young seedlings are just planted.)

714
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,240
(The crops are newly sown.)

715
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,007
(Spring rain is as precious as oil.)

716
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,213
(Grain Rain)

717
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,000
What are you doing here?

718
00:31:56,093 --> 00:31:57,925
Haven't you already worked
two night shifts in a row?

719
00:31:58,026 --> 00:31:59,946
The flu this time is too severe.

720
00:32:00,026 --> 00:32:01,226
Liu's child is also sick.

721
00:32:01,306 --> 00:32:02,678
There is really no one else
to take over the shift.

722
00:32:03,306 --> 00:32:04,186
As a single man,

723
00:32:04,266 --> 00:32:05,186
I have to go

724
00:32:05,266 --> 00:32:06,186
wherever I am needed.

725
00:32:06,506 --> 00:32:08,245
All right. Stay here
and keep watch then.

726
00:32:08,386 --> 00:32:10,452
I'm going to the ward.
It can't be left unattended.

727
00:32:11,146 --> 00:32:11,946
By the way,

728
00:32:12,026 --> 00:32:13,706
pay extra attention
to the child in bed 34

729
00:32:13,786 --> 00:32:14,987
who has pneumonia.

730
00:32:15,306 --> 00:32:16,547
He had a seizure last night.

731
00:32:16,627 --> 00:32:18,466
His mum almost had
a breakdown because of it.

732
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,400
Got it.

733
00:32:26,426 --> 00:32:28,186
Dr Peng, a child needs
a lumbar puncture.

734
00:32:28,506 --> 00:32:29,706
Got it. I'll be right over.

735
00:32:29,786 --> 00:32:30,586
Okay.

736
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:32,960
Jason, right?

737
00:32:33,205 --> 00:32:34,086
I'm Dr Peng.

738
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,105
I will perform
a lumbar puncture on you later.

739
00:32:36,186 --> 00:32:38,812
We'll start by administering
anaesthesia, so it won't be painful.

740
00:32:39,146 --> 00:32:40,546
As a brave man,

741
00:32:40,707 --> 00:32:41,987
you will be brave, right?

742
00:32:42,426 --> 00:32:43,267
You won't cry, right?

743
00:32:43,347 --> 00:32:44,986
Come on, fist bump.

744
00:32:46,666 --> 00:32:48,586
-Step back!
-Mummy! Don't touch me!

745
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:50,306
What are you doing to my child...

746
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,921
Mummy, I don't want to do this.

747
00:32:54,786 --> 00:32:56,946
Madam, maybe you should
talk to your son first

748
00:32:57,026 --> 00:32:58,298
before we perform the surgery.

749
00:32:59,707 --> 00:33:00,507
Sorry about this.

750
00:33:01,546 --> 00:33:04,306
Jason, you are a good boy, right?

751
00:33:05,026 --> 00:33:06,027
Want to go out and play?

752
00:33:06,107 --> 00:33:07,266
Thanks, Peng.

753
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,120
If it weren't for you, I would
have been beaten to death today.

754
00:33:10,186 --> 00:33:11,546
I learned this the hard way.

755
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:12,906
You are an intern.

756
00:33:13,067 --> 00:33:14,386
You've got a lot to learn.

757
00:33:19,306 --> 00:33:20,106
Meng Meng?

758
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,760
Meng Meng,

759
00:33:21,945 --> 00:33:23,106
do you remember me?

760
00:33:23,627 --> 00:33:25,306
We met at the supermarket before.

761
00:33:25,506 --> 00:33:26,825
I performed acupuncture on you.

762
00:33:27,845 --> 00:33:28,926
I'm Ren Tian Zhen.

763
00:33:29,532 --> 00:33:30,332
Hello.

764
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:34,947
It's Grain Rain today.

765
00:33:35,306 --> 00:33:37,387
We are going to collect
Grain Rain tea leaves

766
00:33:37,467 --> 00:33:38,826
and maybe view peony flowers.

767
00:33:38,906 --> 00:33:40,186
It's going to be fun.

768
00:33:40,906 --> 00:33:42,186
Would you like to come with us?

769
00:33:45,026 --> 00:33:46,786
You see, we are ready to depart now.

770
00:33:47,026 --> 00:33:47,826
Come with us.

771
00:33:50,546 --> 00:33:51,346
Come.

772
00:33:51,906 --> 00:33:52,706
Don't be afraid.

773
00:33:59,067 --> 00:33:59,867
Easy.

774
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,427
You see, it's right there.
Let's go there.

775
00:34:10,146 --> 00:34:11,026
Mrs Xu,

776
00:34:11,306 --> 00:34:12,867
park your car outside later.

777
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,440
We will go by the bus.

778
00:34:16,026 --> 00:34:17,306
Why isn't Mr Xu here?

779
00:34:17,386 --> 00:34:19,505
He made an emergency trip
to the United States last night.

780
00:34:19,627 --> 00:34:21,299
(Du Cai Qing)
He will come back this weekend.

781
00:34:23,952 --> 00:34:25,826
Please tell him

782
00:34:25,906 --> 00:34:27,027
to come right away

783
00:34:27,166 --> 00:34:28,565
when he comes back.

784
00:34:28,947 --> 00:34:30,347
This is very important.

785
00:34:31,506 --> 00:34:32,306
Dr Song,

786
00:34:33,146 --> 00:34:34,026
sorry about this,

787
00:34:34,506 --> 00:34:35,786
but I have to leave too.

788
00:34:36,186 --> 00:34:37,106
Here's the thing.

789
00:34:37,186 --> 00:34:38,706
We received a sudden notification

790
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,240
that there are fire hazards
at our exhibition next month.

791
00:34:41,306 --> 00:34:43,106
My paintings are too valuable.

792
00:34:43,186 --> 00:34:45,405
I have to go back and
keep an eye on things personally.

793
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:46,960
Didn't you say

794
00:34:47,023 --> 00:34:49,063
this treatment requires
both parents to be present?

795
00:34:49,107 --> 00:34:50,466
You see, Xu isn't here too.

796
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:51,586
When he comes back,

797
00:34:51,666 --> 00:34:52,546
we will come together.

798
00:34:56,786 --> 00:34:58,186
Meng Meng is your child.

799
00:34:58,707 --> 00:35:00,147
If you prioritize all the things

800
00:35:00,227 --> 00:35:01,786
ahead of your child,

801
00:35:02,026 --> 00:35:03,405
then there is nothing I can't do.

802
00:35:04,266 --> 00:35:06,666
But life is not a television program

803
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:08,966
that can be replayed.

804
00:35:09,786 --> 00:35:11,546
Time moves on linearly.

805
00:35:12,612 --> 00:35:14,445
It can't be paused indefinitely
for anyone.

806
00:35:22,906 --> 00:35:24,147
Let's go, Meng Meng.
It's okay.

807
00:35:24,227 --> 00:35:25,560
Let me introduce my classmates.

808
00:35:28,266 --> 00:35:29,146
It's okay.

809
00:35:29,467 --> 00:35:30,636
-Don't be afraid.
-Hi, Meng Meng.

810
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,559
You see, you've met him last time.

811
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,440
Meng Meng.

812
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,832
-Hi, Meng Meng.
-Zhao Li Quan.

813
00:35:34,913 --> 00:35:36,273
We've met before. Remember me?

814
00:35:36,627 --> 00:35:38,587
-At the supermarket.
-What is his name?

815
00:35:39,227 --> 00:35:40,146
I'm Zhao Li Quan.

816
00:35:40,467 --> 00:35:43,120
Yes. Meng Meng, don't be afraid.
It's okay.

817
00:35:43,187 --> 00:35:44,266
He's my friend. It's okay.

818
00:35:45,627 --> 00:35:46,466
Relax. It's fine.

819
00:35:46,546 --> 00:35:49,347
Meng Meng, you're finally here!

820
00:35:49,427 --> 00:35:50,827
Hold on, hold on, Tou Tou.

821
00:35:50,907 --> 00:35:52,706
-Don't you remember me, Meng Meng?
-Meng Meng, listen.

822
00:35:52,786 --> 00:35:55,186
-Don't you remember me, Meng Meng?
-She's the girl who was more manly than

823
00:35:55,266 --> 00:35:56,265
the boys in the supermarket last time.

824
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,040
Remember her?
You've met before, Meng Meng.

825
00:35:58,147 --> 00:35:58,947
It's me.

826
00:35:59,147 --> 00:35:59,947
She's Sun Tou Tou.

827
00:36:02,746 --> 00:36:03,546
Hang on.

828
00:36:04,387 --> 00:36:05,319
Meng Meng,

829
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,520
don't worry.

830
00:36:06,587 --> 00:36:08,466
Don't mind these annoying boys.

831
00:36:08,546 --> 00:36:09,906
If you need anything,

832
00:36:09,986 --> 00:36:10,786
just come to me.

833
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,946
We are roommates starting today.
We're going to live together!

834
00:36:14,026 --> 00:36:15,787
What are you talking about, Sun Tou Tou?

835
00:36:15,867 --> 00:36:16,906
She's scared!

836
00:36:16,986 --> 00:36:17,866
-Knock it off.
-Scared of what?

837
00:36:17,946 --> 00:36:18,747
-Give me a hug!
-Leave her alone.

838
00:36:18,827 --> 00:36:19,827
I'm your roommate.

839
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,600
It is the middle of March.

840
00:36:31,879 --> 00:36:33,960
The garden is green with flowers.

841
00:36:34,187 --> 00:36:35,986
The morning doves
are singing in the house,

842
00:36:36,187 --> 00:36:38,026
indulging in spring sleep by the window.

843
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,386
The cooing dove flaps its wings,
indicating the arrival of Grain Rain.

844
00:36:44,306 --> 00:36:45,107
Nephew.

845
00:36:46,427 --> 00:36:47,227
Nephew.

846
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:50,600
The ancients said
we should indulge in spring sleep,

847
00:36:50,986 --> 00:36:53,146
but here I am, picking tea leaves
early in the morning,

848
00:36:53,226 --> 00:36:54,746
I can't even open my eyes.

849
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,999
She has been

850
00:36:59,746 --> 00:37:01,946
finding more ways
to use your words against you.

851
00:37:04,303 --> 00:37:05,186
In that case,

852
00:37:05,266 --> 00:37:06,786
it seems like I do need to read more.

853
00:37:07,466 --> 00:37:09,386
If I had known this poem earlier,

854
00:37:09,466 --> 00:37:10,867
I wouldn't have to wake up early.

855
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:12,746
That's right.

856
00:37:13,226 --> 00:37:14,667
You should read more.

857
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:15,880
You see,

858
00:37:16,226 --> 00:37:17,706
you can even quote classics

859
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,299
when you are arguing.

860
00:37:24,272 --> 00:37:25,393
There is a flower here.

861
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,680
Leave it.

862
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,681
In the three months of spring,

863
00:37:31,986 --> 00:37:33,026
do not kill the living,

864
00:37:34,187 --> 00:37:34,987
What does that mean?

865
00:37:50,786 --> 00:37:51,586
Meng Meng,

866
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,140
are you feeling cold?

867
00:37:55,827 --> 00:37:56,627
Here. Put this on.

868
00:38:02,827 --> 00:38:03,627
What are you doing?

869
00:38:06,067 --> 00:38:07,067
Zhen Zhen,

870
00:38:07,387 --> 00:38:08,506
what are you doing here?

871
00:38:09,746 --> 00:38:10,866
I feel really cold too.

872
00:38:10,946 --> 00:38:12,466
Do you have any more clothes for me?

873
00:38:12,746 --> 00:38:13,546
No.

874
00:38:13,706 --> 00:38:14,906
Just hold yourself tight.

875
00:38:14,986 --> 00:38:15,786
You will be fine.

876
00:38:15,986 --> 00:38:17,747
No.

877
00:38:17,827 --> 00:38:20,747
Tou Tou, the way you talk is a bit...

878
00:38:20,885 --> 00:38:23,386
Come on, Li Quan,

879
00:38:23,466 --> 00:38:25,507
the wind is so strong.

880
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:28,120
So strong. I'm weak.

881
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,200
When the wind blows,

882
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,640
I feel so sad.

883
00:38:30,706 --> 00:38:32,546
You just don't understand me.

884
00:38:36,266 --> 00:38:37,666
What's wrong with you guys?

885
00:38:37,746 --> 00:38:39,226
What is the meaning of this?

886
00:38:40,387 --> 00:38:41,666
I'm also girl.

887
00:38:41,746 --> 00:38:43,667
What's wrong with me feeling cold?

888
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,560
This is annoying!

889
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,356
Meng Meng, let me help you.

890
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:58,840
Let's go.

891
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:02,840
Come on.

892
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,360
I'm leaving then.

893
00:39:14,907 --> 00:39:16,226
You're so disgusting.

894
00:39:24,746 --> 00:39:25,546
Ren Tian Zhen,

895
00:39:26,226 --> 00:39:27,305
have you lost your mind?

896
00:39:28,786 --> 00:39:31,307
Why are you so double-standard?

897
00:39:31,387 --> 00:39:34,187
You help everyone with
their baskets, except for me!

898
00:39:34,546 --> 00:39:35,346
You can't catch me.

899
00:39:38,147 --> 00:39:39,186
-Keep running.
-What are you doing?

900
00:39:39,266 --> 00:39:40,707
-Keep running.
-You...

901
00:39:41,506 --> 00:39:42,306
Wait.

902
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:47,999
Ling Lan!

903
00:39:49,786 --> 00:39:51,466
Ling Lan, thank goodness I caught you.

904
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,410
Otherwise, you would've fallen
into the pot,

905
00:39:53,827 --> 00:39:54,627
right?

906
00:39:56,387 --> 00:39:57,466
Let go, let go.

907
00:39:58,986 --> 00:39:59,786
Tou Tou.

908
00:40:01,187 --> 00:40:02,786
Don't be impulsive.

909
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:04,987
No, Master, look at him.

910
00:40:05,067 --> 00:40:06,226
He carried the basket

911
00:40:06,306 --> 00:40:07,507
for every girl,

912
00:40:07,587 --> 00:40:08,507
but he wouldn't carry mine.

913
00:40:08,546 --> 00:40:09,787
-Why did he do that?
-You haven't paid back

914
00:40:09,867 --> 00:40:11,339
for Meng Meng's dad's glasses.

915
00:40:15,919 --> 00:40:16,719
Behave yourself.

916
00:40:23,667 --> 00:40:25,147
Come here. Fry the tea leaves.

917
00:40:25,827 --> 00:40:26,627
Coming.

918
00:40:27,272 --> 00:40:28,072
Leave this task

919
00:40:28,986 --> 00:40:30,466
to a chef.

920
00:40:30,786 --> 00:40:31,667
Are you okay, Mum?

921
00:40:31,827 --> 00:40:32,627
I'm fine.

922
00:40:33,627 --> 00:40:34,506
Dad is impressive.

923
00:40:36,506 --> 00:40:37,506
Very impressive.

924
00:40:42,072 --> 00:40:42,873
Go get another pot.

925
00:40:43,466 --> 00:40:44,266
Okay.

926
00:41:03,786 --> 00:41:04,586
Tou Tou.

927
00:41:04,986 --> 00:41:06,986
Tou Tou, come here.

928
00:41:07,466 --> 00:41:08,266
Come look at this.

929
00:41:11,667 --> 00:41:12,467
Hurry.

930
00:41:12,907 --> 00:41:13,707
Look at that.

931
00:41:18,627 --> 00:41:19,427
It's the Milky Way.

932
00:41:19,518 --> 00:41:20,920
-Isn't it beautiful?
-Yes.

933
00:41:28,907 --> 00:41:30,506
I heard it.

934
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,721
You can even sing

935
00:41:35,085 --> 00:41:37,365
in different vocal parts?

936
00:41:38,667 --> 00:41:41,147
How do you sing so beautifully?

937
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:43,961
Who's singing?

938
00:41:45,153 --> 00:41:46,032
Who's singing?

939
00:41:46,226 --> 00:41:48,266
Everything is singing.

940
00:41:49,466 --> 00:41:51,187
They have spirituality.

941
00:41:52,067 --> 00:41:54,387
The way you talk to them,

942
00:41:55,187 --> 00:41:57,466
and your attitude towards them,

943
00:41:58,226 --> 00:41:59,266
they know it.

944
00:42:02,659 --> 00:42:03,459
Tou Tou,

945
00:42:03,986 --> 00:42:05,506
can you locate the Big Dipper?

946
00:42:06,546 --> 00:42:08,667
Don't be silly, my dear nephew.

947
00:42:09,147 --> 00:42:10,347
If I could find the Big Dipper,

948
00:42:10,387 --> 00:42:12,226
would I have gotten lost
on the mountain that time?

949
00:42:12,306 --> 00:42:13,626
Would I not have found my way back?

950
00:42:13,706 --> 00:42:15,346
I will show you. Watch.

951
00:42:15,733 --> 00:42:16,772
The brightest ones there.

952
00:42:17,306 --> 00:42:22,306
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

953
00:42:23,786 --> 00:42:25,347
Picture it in your mind.

954
00:42:25,427 --> 00:42:27,946
Imagine the Big Dipper

955
00:42:28,627 --> 00:42:30,187
as a clock.

956
00:42:31,746 --> 00:42:34,946
When the Big Dipper points to Chen,

957
00:42:35,026 --> 00:42:36,192
it's the time of Grain Rain.

958
00:42:37,706 --> 00:42:39,266
-Chen?
-That's right.

959
00:42:40,067 --> 00:42:41,026
What time is that?

960
00:42:41,706 --> 00:42:43,067
From 7am to 9am,

961
00:42:43,667 --> 00:42:44,946
when you have breakfast.

962
00:42:46,067 --> 00:42:47,626
But why is it called Grain Rain?

963
00:42:47,706 --> 00:42:48,627
It's not raining here.

964
00:42:49,466 --> 00:42:51,506
It will rain at night.

965
00:42:52,187 --> 00:42:54,427
Grain Rain brings rain,

966
00:42:54,986 --> 00:42:56,187
indicating a good harvest.

967
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:01,178

00:43:01,259 --> 00:43:02,659
