1
00:00:04,159 --> 00:00:06,960
We will continue with
the apprentice class on weekends.

2
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:12,116
Am I going to do acupuncture
or prepare herbal medicine?

3
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:13,373
You are sweeping the floor.

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,080
During this period,

5
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:21,119
we will invite influential teachers

6
00:00:21,436 --> 00:00:24,637
from different schools

7
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,676
and with different specialities

8
00:00:26,759 --> 00:00:27,916
to give you lectures.

9
00:00:27,999 --> 00:00:29,916
We hope that everyone of you

10
00:00:29,999 --> 00:00:32,157
can find out a field that you like

11
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,197
and is most suitable for you

12
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,799
during this learning period.

13
00:00:38,867 --> 00:00:39,890
You don't have a choice.

14
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:41,292
You'll just have to follow me.

15
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,917
Mr Ren, my paid leave is over.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,477
I have to return to the hospital to work.

17
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,876
I will frequently take leave
from the apprentice class.

18
00:00:47,959 --> 00:00:48,957
It's not a problem.

19
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,120
You and Xing Xing
are both healthcare workers.

20
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,596
The reason why I am teaching you
is because I hope that

21
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:57,288
you can apply TCM to your daily life.

22
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,200
Go on. Go back to work.

23
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,437
Shi Yan, for the classes you miss,

24
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,117
you can ask your classmates later
and make up for them.

25
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,200
Got it.

26
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,200
Tou,

27
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,877
you need surplus grain
to distribute porridge.

28
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,917
As for this saline-alkali land of
yours, you can keep it to yourself.

29
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:16,200
I'd better seek help from
our top-performing student, Ms Yang.

30
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,397
I'll trouble you with this in the future.

31
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,480
Thank you in advance.

32
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,720
I have run out of surplus grain.

33
00:01:23,113 --> 00:01:25,027
You are a rich mine,
overflowing with wealth.

34
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:26,335
Professor Ren.

35
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,476
Are they the mother and daughter
you told me about?

36
00:01:29,559 --> 00:01:30,559
Yes, yes.

37
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,320
Zhu Xia and Ding Jian Xi.

38
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,196
-Hi.
-Professor Ren.

39
00:01:35,279 --> 00:01:36,845
Finally, we've been waiting for you.

40
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:38,979
Please help my daughter.

41
00:01:39,279 --> 00:01:41,319
If even you tell us that it's hopeless,

42
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,760
then she can only stay
this way until she dies.

43
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,599
Don't talk about death all the time.

44
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,840
In this place,

45
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,997
it's not easy to die even if you want to.

46
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,570
I've been briefed

47
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,399
about her condition.

48
00:01:53,687 --> 00:01:54,887
Let me take a look.

49
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,640
Come. Easy, easy.

50
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,280
Do you feel anything?

51
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,560
Her condition

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,957
is basically incurable.

53
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,258
Western doctors said that she would
stay this way for the rest of her life.

54
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,256
Professor Ren, if even you say

55
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,360
there is no way,

56
00:02:39,453 --> 00:02:40,453
then...

57
00:02:51,153 --> 00:02:52,153
Don't worry.

58
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,560
There is a way.

59
00:02:56,947 --> 00:02:57,947
There is a way.

60
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,679
I just remembered that

61
00:02:59,799 --> 00:03:02,200
there was this master
I apprenticed under before.

62
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,223
He taught me about

63
00:03:03,306 --> 00:03:04,716
bone resetting

64
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:07,400
and spinal rehabilitation.

65
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,040
I recall writing it down in a notebook.

66
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,356
Oh, right. There is a notebook
in my desk drawer.

67
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,440
Please get it for me.

68
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,597
That means my daughter's
condition is curable?

69
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,200
This medicine

70
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,760
might be difficult to find.

71
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,504
It's okay. Just tell me.

72
00:03:27,587 --> 00:03:28,437
I'll do everything

73
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,559
I can to find it.

74
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,640
Is it the one?

75
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,840
Let me see.

76
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,000
No peeking.

77
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,037
If you look without my permission,
you will get red eyes.

78
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,120
Go over there.

79
00:03:52,986 --> 00:03:53,986
This should be the one.

80
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,317
Tiles from the top of kitchen stove,

81
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,920
from an old house
that is over 300 years old,

82
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,360
soak it in child's urine

83
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,560
for 21 days.

84
00:04:06,139 --> 00:04:08,499
Grind it into powder and
take it with the rice wine.

85
00:04:09,918 --> 00:04:11,319
Take... Take it?

86
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,480
You mean, drink it?

87
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:17,006
Pee and tiles?

88
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:19,020
Amazing.

89
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,717
TCM practitioners aren't afraid to bluff.

90
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,931
-I'll go and find it now.
-Mind your own business.

91
00:04:24,713 --> 00:04:25,913
This should be the remedy.

92
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,399
But you know,

93
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,879
it's not easy to find houses that are

94
00:04:32,393 --> 00:04:33,611
over 300 years old nowadays.

95
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,957
There are so many places in the country.

96
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,397
I just need to find one.

97
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,374
I would find them

98
00:04:38,457 --> 00:04:40,457
even if I had to remove
the beams of the house.

99
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,279
You can't do that.

100
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,957
That's illegal.

101
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,080
You will get arrested.

102
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,811
-You know, I was arrested last time...
-Tou Tou...

103
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,571
Don't you have an appetite?
Why aren't you eating?

104
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,955
Quan, is something bothering you?

105
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,880
Why are you sighing?

106
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:16,159
The dishes today aren't very appetizing.

107
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,143
What you make for us is better than this.

108
00:05:20,092 --> 00:05:21,092
But it's healthy.

109
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,520
How about you ask Roubecca
to give you some of her salad?

110
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,680
Would you like some?

111
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,160
I was thinking about Ding Jian Xi
and her mother.

112
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,680
You also think that Mr Ren's remedy
is too far-fetched?

113
00:05:32,785 --> 00:05:34,706
I just feel bad for her parents.

114
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,557
She and her mum have to go through this.

115
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,119
If this happened on me,

116
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,399
my parents would probably faint on
the spot upon hearing the news.

117
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,680
Yes. It's true that
it's quite miserable.

118
00:05:48,559 --> 00:05:49,437
Tian Zhen,

119
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,437
they are already so miserable.

120
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,564
How could your dad
still blatantly deceive them?

121
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,717
Listen to this.

122
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,758
He can cure a patient
with a completely broken spine

123
00:05:55,841 --> 00:05:58,480
by using 300-year-old tiles
and child's urine?

124
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:00,319
This is not medicine,

125
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,680
it's witchcraft.

126
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,437
Never mind whether
it's medicine or witchcraft.

127
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,129
If it works, that's all that matters.

128
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,356
In traditional Chinese characters,
the character for

129
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:10,803
"medicine" originally had
the character for "shaman" below it.

130
00:06:10,886 --> 00:06:11,757
Tian Zhen,

131
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,120
this is unlike you.

132
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,157
You have received
basic education in materialism.

133
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,277
What is the science in this?

134
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,480
Do you really believe

135
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,800
that paralysis can be cured with
300-year-old tiles and child's urine?

136
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,160
Yes, I believe it.

137
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:26,879
Otherwise, why do we have so few houses
that are over 300 years old

138
00:06:26,993 --> 00:06:27,993
compared to Europe?

139
00:06:29,427 --> 00:06:31,036
Do you TCM practitioners
all think like this?

140
00:06:31,119 --> 00:06:33,163
In Li Shi Zhen's
"Compendium of Materia Medica",

141
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,317
he wrote that shoe sole mud,

142
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,240
manure pit mud,

143
00:06:35,323 --> 00:06:36,677
and foot-wrapping cloth
are all medicinal.

144
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,953
But look at the Westerners,

145
00:06:38,332 --> 00:06:39,920
they have Moscow Mathematical Papyrus,

146
00:06:40,003 --> 00:06:41,381
Rhind Mathematical Papyrus,

147
00:06:41,464 --> 00:06:42,437
and later works like Euclid's Elements

148
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,726
and The Art of Calculation.

149
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:45,636
I understand that acupuncture

150
00:06:45,719 --> 00:06:47,360
might work for spinal cord injuries,

151
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:48,899
but this particular remedy

152
00:06:49,288 --> 00:06:50,489
sounds toxic.

153
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,196
How could it possibly be effective?

154
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:54,597
This is the difference
between folk remedies

155
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,999
and actual science.

156
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,717
What does that mean?

157
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,999
Didn't Xin Zheng say it's curable?

158
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,447
How's acupuncture different from
taking medicine?

159
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,600
Tou, the spine

160
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:11,680
is like this bone.

161
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,677
The vertebrae

162
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,437
are connected by ligaments,
muscles, and nerves.

163
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,680
This way, the central nervous system
in your brain

164
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,601
can transmit signals to
every part of your body,

165
00:07:20,684 --> 00:07:21,717
allowing you to run,

166
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,677
jump,

167
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,847
and feel sensations such as
cold, heat, and pain.

168
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,360
But Jian Xi,

169
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:29,559
from her waist here,

170
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,720
it's broken.

171
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,476
The bone is broken but the flesh
surrounding it remains intact.

172
00:07:34,559 --> 00:07:36,920
Modern medicine is capable
of rejoining broken bones,

173
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,144
nerves,

174
00:07:38,227 --> 00:07:40,106
and even muscles.

175
00:07:40,453 --> 00:07:43,012
However, once the signal transmission
is interrupted,

176
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:44,637
reconnecting it

177
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,920
is highly complex.

178
00:07:46,119 --> 00:07:48,380
Modern medicine has not yet
found a solution to this.

179
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,255
I may not

180
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:52,778
fully understand neurology,

181
00:07:52,967 --> 00:07:54,007
but I think

182
00:07:54,366 --> 00:07:55,717
the regeneration of neurons

183
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,401
can be facilitated through methods
such as acupuncture and moxibustion,

184
00:07:58,484 --> 00:08:00,123
which involve repetitive stimulation.

185
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:02,090
Such methods are likely to be effective.

186
00:08:02,173 --> 00:08:03,173
However, the idea

187
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,520
of simply consuming medication

188
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,036
can restore sensation

189
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:08,036
to a paralysed person

190
00:08:08,119 --> 00:08:09,960
does not seem logically sound

191
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:11,237
to me.

192
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,320
Rebecca,

193
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,040
great minds think alike.

194
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,320
Give me five.

195
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,240
Tian Zhen,

196
00:08:19,559 --> 00:08:21,640
how confident do you think
Mr Ren is this time?

197
00:08:22,287 --> 00:08:23,607
I can't figure him out.

198
00:08:26,646 --> 00:08:27,646
My dad said

199
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,597
that our ancestors
believed it to be effective.

200
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,680
Thank you.

201
00:08:43,533 --> 00:08:44,533
I think...

202
00:08:46,763 --> 00:08:48,279
I think you are cool.

203
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,560
You look cool when you work.

204
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,277
I think you look so cool in everything

205
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,477
you do.

206
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,639
Don't you find it strange?
You are so handsome.

207
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,745
What you said is already
considered sexual harassment.

208
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,197
Seriously? This is sexual harassment
just because I complimented you?

209
00:09:08,719 --> 00:09:10,240
I can't even compliment you now?

210
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,839
Now this is sexual harassment!

211
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,360
You...

212
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:31,599
I'm sorry.

213
00:09:32,599 --> 00:09:33,599
It's broken.

214
00:09:33,719 --> 00:09:35,079
I stepped on it.

215
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,360
(Xu Jie)
I'm really sorry.

216
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,957
All right. No need for any explanations.

217
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,360
How do you want to solve this?

218
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,560
I will

219
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,159
compensate you.

220
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,000
I will pay you the money
you paid for this.

221
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,240
Over 10,000 yuan.

222
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,959
Over 10,000 yuan?

223
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,120
Hang on...

224
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,399
She will pay you back.

225
00:10:05,719 --> 00:10:06,717
Don't worry, sir.

226
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,597
She will definitely pay you back for
these glasses at the original price.

227
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,507
It'll just cost her
three months' salaries.

228
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,520
Here's the thing, sir.

229
00:10:18,187 --> 00:10:19,492
Let me explain the logic here.

230
00:10:20,307 --> 00:10:22,184
All I did was complimenting him just now.

231
00:10:22,267 --> 00:10:23,744
Is there anything wrong
with saying he looks cool?

232
00:10:23,827 --> 00:10:24,744
No, right?

233
00:10:24,827 --> 00:10:26,436
And he just turned around and hit me.

234
00:10:26,747 --> 00:10:28,547
I bumped into you because he hit me.

235
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,224
I wouldn't have done so
if he hadn't hit me.

236
00:10:30,307 --> 00:10:32,583
I wouldn't have stepped on your glasses
if he hadn't hit me.

237
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:34,984
I wouldn't have had to pay you
back 10,000 yuan if he hadn't hit me.

238
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:36,904
Am I right?
So, he's responsible for this.

239
00:10:36,987 --> 00:10:38,093
Ask him to pay you back.

240
00:10:38,507 --> 00:10:39,463
He's rich.

241
00:10:39,546 --> 00:10:41,747
This big medical centre
belongs to his family.

242
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,957
He's a son from a rich family.

243
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,117
He's got lots of money,

244
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,200
you know?

245
00:10:45,546 --> 00:10:46,590
What are you looking at?

246
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,599
That's right.
I'm moral blackmailing you.

247
00:10:49,546 --> 00:10:51,146
You are Professor Ren's son?

248
00:10:53,267 --> 00:10:54,507
I am. And you are?

249
00:10:56,307 --> 00:10:57,906
You saved my daughter.

250
00:10:58,307 --> 00:10:59,427
I'm Xu Meng's father.

251
00:11:02,747 --> 00:11:03,791
Do you remember Xu Meng?

252
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,920
How is she doing now?

253
00:11:06,187 --> 00:11:07,187
Not really good.

254
00:11:08,307 --> 00:11:10,568
Do you still want us
to pay you back for the glasses?

255
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,689
She lost her sanity?

256
00:11:14,772 --> 00:11:15,772
She lost her sanity?

257
00:11:18,987 --> 00:11:21,784
Meng Meng has always been
well behaved since she was young.

258
00:11:21,867 --> 00:11:22,987
As her parents,

259
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,023
we haven't had to worry much
about her life and studies.

260
00:11:25,106 --> 00:11:28,987
Perhaps we've been too overprotective
of her since she was little.

261
00:11:29,103 --> 00:11:31,026
She just can't tell right from wrong,

262
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,400
so she was tricked by a boy.

263
00:11:33,483 --> 00:11:35,227
Do you know this boy?

264
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,080
No. She wouldn't tell us.

265
00:11:37,212 --> 00:11:39,343
Her mother and I have been too busy
with our work.

266
00:11:41,187 --> 00:11:42,187
Actually,

267
00:11:42,747 --> 00:11:43,904
we only learned about this

268
00:11:43,987 --> 00:11:45,292
a little earlier than you did.

269
00:11:45,507 --> 00:11:47,029
I'm sure you didn't ask her before.

270
00:11:47,187 --> 00:11:50,101
Maybe she had mentioned it,
and you just didn't pay attention to it.

271
00:11:53,187 --> 00:11:54,187
Mr Xu,

272
00:11:54,307 --> 00:11:57,026
you said Meng Meng
had some new issues lately.

273
00:11:57,307 --> 00:11:58,747
Would you mind elaborating it?

274
00:12:00,627 --> 00:12:02,146
She broke down.

275
00:12:02,987 --> 00:12:04,770
Before, she had a very gentle personality

276
00:12:05,413 --> 00:12:06,631
and was very kind to people.

277
00:12:06,827 --> 00:12:08,610
But now she seems
to have only two states,

278
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,984
either she snaps at people
or she resorts to violence.

279
00:12:11,067 --> 00:12:12,067
Resorts to violence?

280
00:12:12,987 --> 00:12:14,867
She smashed everything in the house.

281
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:17,787
Now I can't have anything sharp, pointed,

282
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,904
or with blades in the house.
I put all our knives and forks away.

283
00:12:19,987 --> 00:12:20,987
To be honest,

284
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:22,744
I can't even cook at home now.

285
00:12:22,827 --> 00:12:23,987
I can only order takeout.

286
00:12:24,987 --> 00:12:28,427
Have you tried going to other hospitals?

287
00:12:30,546 --> 00:12:31,546
We took her

288
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,960
to the Fourth Hospital once before.

289
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,146
They administered electroconvulsive
therapy (ECT) to her there.

290
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,040
ECT?

291
00:12:40,867 --> 00:12:43,146
You know, after that session of ECT,

292
00:12:43,867 --> 00:12:44,867
she became

293
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:46,464
even more distressed.

294
00:12:48,307 --> 00:12:49,307
You know,

295
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,051
now she won't talk anymore

296
00:12:51,226 --> 00:12:52,544
and has become unwilling to move.

297
00:12:52,627 --> 00:12:54,062
She even refused to go to school.

298
00:12:57,747 --> 00:12:59,786
I'm at my wits' end now, Dr Ren.

299
00:13:00,427 --> 00:13:03,187
After thinking about it, I thought
since you saved her life,

300
00:13:03,433 --> 00:13:04,952
I could only come to you

301
00:13:05,172 --> 00:13:06,390
and ask for your help again.

302
00:13:06,866 --> 00:13:07,866
I mean it.

303
00:13:08,507 --> 00:13:09,546
She's my only daughter.

304
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,520
Professor Ren,

305
00:13:11,827 --> 00:13:13,307
please do whatever you can

306
00:13:14,067 --> 00:13:15,346
to save my girl.

307
00:13:15,827 --> 00:13:17,427
Money isn't a problem.

308
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,984
If money could really solve the problem,
you wouldn't be here.

309
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:22,067
Tian Zhen.

310
00:13:28,427 --> 00:13:29,427
How about this?

311
00:13:30,187 --> 00:13:31,546
We will go take a look at her.

312
00:13:32,987 --> 00:13:33,987
No problem.

313
00:13:36,546 --> 00:13:37,544
Where is Cai Qing?

314
00:13:37,627 --> 00:13:40,080
Madam received a phone call
and hurriedly went out.

315
00:13:40,427 --> 00:13:41,867
She left Meng Meng alone again.

316
00:13:59,627 --> 00:14:00,627
Meng Meng.

317
00:14:02,187 --> 00:14:03,187
Meng Meng.

318
00:14:04,747 --> 00:14:06,344
Meng Meng, you will get a cold
with your bare feet.

319
00:14:06,427 --> 00:14:07,427
Wear your slippers.

320
00:14:08,307 --> 00:14:09,307
Meng Meng!

321
00:14:10,747 --> 00:14:11,747
Meng Meng.

322
00:14:22,507 --> 00:14:23,507
Meng Meng.

323
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:24,666
Meng Meng.

324
00:14:26,106 --> 00:14:27,586
I'm Dr Song.

325
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,001
Do you remember me?

326
00:14:39,987 --> 00:14:41,307
I'm Dr Song.

327
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:47,346
We met in the hospital before.

328
00:14:47,947 --> 00:14:49,106
I'm Dr Song.

329
00:14:53,507 --> 00:14:54,424
It's okay.

330
00:14:54,507 --> 00:14:55,583
You are okay now.

331
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:56,637
It's okay.

332
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,999
It's okay.

333
00:14:58,158 --> 00:14:59,277
It's okay.

334
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,360
It's okay.

335
00:15:03,546 --> 00:15:04,546
Mr Xu,

336
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:06,226
please leave us the room.

337
00:15:06,507 --> 00:15:08,594
My husband and I would like
to talk to her alone.

338
00:15:09,546 --> 00:15:10,590
I will leave her to you.

339
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,160
It's all right now.

340
00:15:14,187 --> 00:15:15,187
You are safe now.

341
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,680
You are safe.

342
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,460
Come.

343
00:15:20,947 --> 00:15:22,187
Let me

344
00:15:22,507 --> 00:15:24,747
take a look at you.

345
00:15:26,987 --> 00:15:27,987
Let's see.

346
00:15:29,106 --> 00:15:30,106
Let's see.

347
00:15:31,867 --> 00:15:33,984
You are still so pretty

348
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:36,067
and good-looking as before.

349
00:15:37,307 --> 00:15:38,304
Du Cai Qing,

350
00:15:38,387 --> 00:15:39,507
didn't we agree on this?

351
00:15:39,867 --> 00:15:41,664
One of us has to stay at home

352
00:15:41,747 --> 00:15:42,900
and look after Meng Meng.

353
00:15:43,867 --> 00:15:44,784
The helper?

354
00:15:44,867 --> 00:15:46,187
How will she be able to help?

355
00:15:47,187 --> 00:15:49,307
Why did you have to leave today?

356
00:15:49,987 --> 00:15:52,799
It's just a stupid exhibition.
Is it a meeting even necessary?

357
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,057
Me?

358
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,659
I even postponed my work for this.

359
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,597
Listen to me,

360
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,864
if nothing happens to Meng Meng,
then it's fine.

361
00:15:59,947 --> 00:16:02,208
But if something happens to her,
I won't forgive you!

362
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,241
Your hands are a little cold.

363
00:16:10,947 --> 00:16:11,947
Right?

364
00:16:12,546 --> 00:16:14,067
Why are your hands so cold?

365
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,761
May I read your pulse?

366
00:16:17,867 --> 00:16:19,747
Your hands are so cold.

367
00:16:21,627 --> 00:16:22,627
It's okay.

368
00:16:23,307 --> 00:16:24,466
It's okay.

369
00:16:30,867 --> 00:16:32,106
Her Cunkou pulse is tight.

370
00:16:36,747 --> 00:16:38,987
Meng Meng, you shouldn't
walk around barefoot.

371
00:16:39,507 --> 00:16:40,666
Come on, sit on the bed.

372
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:42,307
Sit on the bed.

373
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,480
Come on. Easy.

374
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,600
Good.

375
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:52,864
Professor Ren, sorry about that.

376
00:16:52,947 --> 00:16:54,666
We are not usually like this.

377
00:16:55,267 --> 00:16:56,304
Her mother really had an emergency today,

378
00:16:56,387 --> 00:16:59,184
otherwise she wouldn't have
left our sick child alone.

379
00:16:59,267 --> 00:17:00,627
Yes, I understand.

380
00:17:00,906 --> 00:17:02,067
But your daughter

381
00:17:03,026 --> 00:17:04,026
isn't sick.

382
00:17:04,907 --> 00:17:05,987
She isn't sick.

383
00:17:06,186 --> 00:17:07,186
Professor Ren,

384
00:17:07,507 --> 00:17:09,346
you saw her with your own eyes just now.

385
00:17:09,525 --> 00:17:10,525
Yes.

386
00:17:10,787 --> 00:17:12,064
After what your daughter
has been through,

387
00:17:12,147 --> 00:17:14,226
she is allowed to have a stress response.

388
00:17:15,507 --> 00:17:16,547
So,

389
00:17:17,027 --> 00:17:19,346
her condition isn't as serious
as you think it is.

390
00:17:19,787 --> 00:17:23,306
In TCM, this can be described
as Qi stagnation and blood stasis.

391
00:17:23,907 --> 00:17:26,168
It can be treated by regulating
the liver and spleen.

392
00:17:27,267 --> 00:17:28,267
Is it that simple?

393
00:17:29,387 --> 00:17:30,944
Just a few doses of medicine,
and she will be fine.

394
00:17:31,027 --> 00:17:32,946
Lift your legs.

395
00:17:33,547 --> 00:17:36,027
Yes. Lift this up too.

396
00:17:36,907 --> 00:17:39,704
Let's cover them up.

397
00:17:39,787 --> 00:17:40,787
Immediately,

398
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,584
your feet won't be cold anymore.

399
00:17:42,667 --> 00:17:43,667
Right?

400
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,980
You and your wife have to join
the treatment with your daughter.

401
00:17:59,507 --> 00:18:00,704
-We have to join it?
-That's right.

402
00:18:00,787 --> 00:18:02,223
-Both of us?
-Yes.

403
00:18:02,306 --> 00:18:03,306
What for?

404
00:18:03,507 --> 00:18:05,203
Parents and daughter share a deep bond.

405
00:18:05,426 --> 00:18:06,627
So, to cure her condition,

406
00:18:06,987 --> 00:18:09,683
your whole family should
participate in the treatment together.

407
00:18:20,027 --> 00:18:21,306
From what you just said,

408
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:23,787
it seems that both of
these girls' conditions

409
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,120
are difficult to treat.

410
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,400
I feel really

411
00:18:29,627 --> 00:18:30,627
frustrated today.

412
00:18:30,907 --> 00:18:31,907
They are both

413
00:18:32,387 --> 00:18:34,667
beautiful young ladies.

414
00:18:34,907 --> 00:18:35,907
Yes.

415
00:18:37,387 --> 00:18:38,387
Actually,

416
00:18:39,267 --> 00:18:40,702
the greatest filial piety a child

417
00:18:40,907 --> 00:18:42,226
can show to their parents

418
00:18:42,987 --> 00:18:44,664
is to stay healthy

419
00:18:44,747 --> 00:18:46,103
and free from illness or harm.

420
00:18:46,186 --> 00:18:47,186
Right?

421
00:18:47,387 --> 00:18:48,387
We can

422
00:18:49,387 --> 00:18:51,507
focus on the girl

423
00:18:51,787 --> 00:18:53,667
with ectopic pregnancy.

424
00:18:53,987 --> 00:18:56,987
She has acute abdominal pain,
which is relatively easier to deal with.

425
00:18:58,147 --> 00:18:59,147
Dad,

426
00:18:59,627 --> 00:19:00,787
I think

427
00:19:01,867 --> 00:19:03,563
Xu Meng's condition is more challenging

428
00:19:05,027 --> 00:19:06,593
to treat compared to Ding Jian Xi's.

429
00:19:07,066 --> 00:19:08,743
For Ding Jian Xi,

430
00:19:08,826 --> 00:19:11,305
the purpose of prescribing medication
is to give her hope.

431
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,124
(Jiangzhou People's Hospital)

432
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:16,706
How do you handle patients?

433
00:19:16,907 --> 00:19:18,784
Haven't you noticed that my mother
has been waiting for 40 minutes?

434
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:19,983
Don't you have a mother?

435
00:19:20,066 --> 00:19:22,547
I'm telling you, if you don't examine
my mother today,

436
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,704
I will make things difficult for you.

437
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:26,304
Why is a grown man like you
bullying a young nurse?

438
00:19:26,387 --> 00:19:28,544
She hasn't been idled
during these 40 minutes.

439
00:19:28,627 --> 00:19:29,544
What do you know?

440
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:31,343
His mother has been suffering from
gastric bloating for about ten days.

441
00:19:31,426 --> 00:19:32,223
But this nurse just told her

442
00:19:32,306 --> 00:19:33,784
to go to the outpatient department
tomorrow morning.

443
00:19:33,867 --> 00:19:34,863
It does sound improper.

444
00:19:34,946 --> 00:19:35,917
Can't you talk nicely?

445
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,544
All of them are busy.

446
00:19:37,627 --> 00:19:40,888
She just saved a child who was choking
on a glutinous rice ball a while ago.

447
00:19:41,106 --> 00:19:42,824
She didn't neglect them.

448
00:19:42,907 --> 00:19:44,343
Like I told you before,

449
00:19:44,426 --> 00:19:46,223
the emergency department is
meant for life-threatening situations.

450
00:19:46,306 --> 00:19:48,277
Gastric bloating for over ten days
is not considered an emergency.

451
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,983
It's more proper for you to visit
the outpatient department tomorrow.

452
00:19:50,066 --> 00:19:51,719
You're just a nurse. What do you know?

453
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,928
If something happens to my mother,

454
00:19:53,011 --> 00:19:54,103
will you be able
to take responsibility for it?

455
00:19:54,186 --> 00:19:56,464
You didn't perform any tests
and just asked us to leave.

456
00:19:56,547 --> 00:19:57,517
-That's right.
-I won't have this.

457
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,209
You have to perform tests
on my mum today.

458
00:19:59,292 --> 00:20:01,383
Or I won't let you do your work.

459
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:03,826
That's right. We won't let you work.

460
00:20:06,267 --> 00:20:07,623
-Come here!
-Let go.

461
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:08,784
Examine my mum!

462
00:20:08,867 --> 00:20:09,867
Examine my mum!

463
00:20:10,147 --> 00:20:12,267
Let go of me. Use words.

464
00:20:13,627 --> 00:20:15,023
Who are you? What are you doing?

465
00:20:15,106 --> 00:20:16,424
Call the cops!

466
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:17,899
What did you say? Call the cops?

467
00:20:18,106 --> 00:20:19,143
Yes, call the cops now.

468
00:20:19,226 --> 00:20:21,053
-Who are you?
-Who am I? Let me tell you...

469
00:20:21,627 --> 00:20:22,757
Hello, police?

470
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,710
All the nurses here
are under my protection.

471
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,833
What's wrong with you people?

472
00:20:27,346 --> 00:20:30,086
Don't you know that the emergency
room is a place to save lives?

473
00:20:31,706 --> 00:20:32,706
What's the matter?

474
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,490
Don't you know how to wait in line?

475
00:20:34,573 --> 00:20:35,773
Don't you have any manners?

476
00:20:36,747 --> 00:20:37,743
Listen,

477
00:20:37,826 --> 00:20:41,103
show more respect when speaking
to healthcare workers in the future,

478
00:20:41,186 --> 00:20:42,186
understood?

479
00:20:46,226 --> 00:20:47,226
I mean,

480
00:20:49,226 --> 00:20:50,418
why can't you wait in line?

481
00:20:50,987 --> 00:20:51,863
Right?

482
00:20:51,946 --> 00:20:53,946
There are so many people
in the emergency room.

483
00:20:54,826 --> 00:20:55,946
Your mother looks fine,

484
00:20:56,346 --> 00:20:57,667
She looks healthy,

485
00:20:57,867 --> 00:20:58,784
right?

486
00:20:58,867 --> 00:21:00,027
I'm talking to them.

487
00:21:00,627 --> 00:21:02,667
Show some respect to...

488
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,880
What?

489
00:21:05,586 --> 00:21:06,586
I was educating him.

490
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,360
Understood?

491
00:21:11,572 --> 00:21:12,572
Understood, guys?

492
00:21:17,066 --> 00:21:18,066
Don't worry.

493
00:21:22,106 --> 00:21:23,933
We went to visit Xu Meng
at her home today.

494
00:21:24,186 --> 00:21:26,547
She pushes her parents away,

495
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:29,706
but she is willing
to let us get close to her.

496
00:21:30,547 --> 00:21:32,547
Actually, her parents love her very much,

497
00:21:33,165 --> 00:21:34,405
but I can feel that

498
00:21:34,652 --> 00:21:36,213
she holds resentment

499
00:21:36,346 --> 00:21:37,627
towards them.

500
00:21:38,066 --> 00:21:39,226
This resentment

501
00:21:40,106 --> 00:21:41,503
has led her to corrupt herself

502
00:21:41,586 --> 00:21:42,586
and give up on herself.

503
00:21:43,226 --> 00:21:44,343
I'm afraid

504
00:21:44,426 --> 00:21:45,586
that one day

505
00:21:46,172 --> 00:21:48,012
she might reach a breaking point

506
00:21:48,226 --> 00:21:50,053
and kill herself
by jumping off a building.

507
00:21:50,673 --> 00:21:51,872
Is it that serious?

508
00:21:53,106 --> 00:21:54,106
Do her parents

509
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:55,627
keep her company?

510
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,920
They are both busy.

511
00:21:59,346 --> 00:22:01,263
Their way of loving their child

512
00:22:01,346 --> 00:22:02,346
is incorrect.

513
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:03,986
Mum, you know,

514
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,761
her mother installed

515
00:22:05,946 --> 00:22:08,223
numerous surveillance cameras
throughout the house,

516
00:22:08,306 --> 00:22:10,547
monitoring her every move.

517
00:22:12,826 --> 00:22:14,944
Their house

518
00:22:15,027 --> 00:22:16,426
really looks like

519
00:22:16,946 --> 00:22:18,026
a model house,

520
00:22:18,198 --> 00:22:19,939
luxurious and grand.

521
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,863
But for that child,

522
00:22:21,946 --> 00:22:23,143
living there is like

523
00:22:23,226 --> 00:22:24,544
living in a luxurious birdcage.

524
00:22:24,627 --> 00:22:25,707
A love like this

525
00:22:25,856 --> 00:22:27,143
suffocates her.

526
00:22:27,226 --> 00:22:28,747
They are bound to have issues.

527
00:22:29,826 --> 00:22:32,664
However, their illnesses
need to be treated together.

528
00:22:32,747 --> 00:22:34,306
Ask her parents come over

529
00:22:34,706 --> 00:22:37,185
I will perform a set of
Five Elements Acupuncture for her.

530
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,148
Emotions and mental state
need to be addressed as well.

531
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,320
Mum,

532
00:22:41,547 --> 00:22:44,196
Xin Zheng told her father
about that today,

533
00:22:44,547 --> 00:22:45,747
but he said

534
00:22:46,346 --> 00:22:47,892
he's going on a business trip soon.

535
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:51,032
He will stay abroad for two months.

536
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,503
They are not proactive
to get her treated.

537
00:22:55,586 --> 00:22:56,586
They may

538
00:22:57,066 --> 00:22:59,383
speak of their child
as their precious darling,

539
00:22:59,466 --> 00:23:00,706
but their actions

540
00:23:01,412 --> 00:23:02,613
contradict their words.

541
00:23:04,346 --> 00:23:06,143
If he truly loves his child,

542
00:23:06,226 --> 00:23:08,023
he should follow
the doctor's advice completely.

543
00:23:08,106 --> 00:23:09,367
With his lack of cooperation,

544
00:23:10,066 --> 00:23:12,125
even if I possess
extraordinary medical skills,

545
00:23:12,627 --> 00:23:14,346
it will be difficult to save her life.

546
00:23:17,586 --> 00:23:18,586
I just made this.

547
00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:20,066
It's still warm.

548
00:23:21,747 --> 00:23:22,747
Sorry.

549
00:23:23,466 --> 00:23:24,466
Try it.

550
00:23:28,706 --> 00:23:29,706
It's good, right?

551
00:23:30,706 --> 00:23:31,517
It is good.

552
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,679
You've gotten better.

553
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I say,

554
00:23:36,226 --> 00:23:38,313
why do you always make a scene
everywhere you go?

555
00:23:38,466 --> 00:23:39,867
Look at what you just did.

556
00:23:40,186 --> 00:23:41,578
Do you want to go to jail again?

557
00:23:45,346 --> 00:23:46,346
Tian Xing Xing,

558
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:47,743
have a conscience.

559
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:49,146
I was standing up for you.

560
00:23:49,286 --> 00:23:50,117
All right.

561
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,200
Fine.

562
00:23:51,403 --> 00:23:54,346
I won't step in to help you next time.
I'll just stand by and watch.

563
00:23:54,987 --> 00:23:55,877
With you around,

564
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,120
no one dares to bully me.

565
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,957
I'm telling you, it's because of you

566
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,216
that I still don't have a boyfriend now.

567
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:02,023
What do you need a boyfriend for?

568
00:24:02,106 --> 00:24:04,506
I mean, if you get a boyfriend,
and he bullies you,

569
00:24:04,672 --> 00:24:06,593
I will still have to teach him a lesson.

570
00:24:11,586 --> 00:24:13,544
The key now is

571
00:24:13,627 --> 00:24:16,383
Meng Meng needs to

572
00:24:16,466 --> 00:24:18,743
break free from the circle she has drawn

573
00:24:18,826 --> 00:24:19,826
around herself.

574
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:23,560
She needs to regain
confidence and dignity.

575
00:24:23,732 --> 00:24:25,023
Dad, Mum,

576
00:24:25,106 --> 00:24:27,237
let her come to our medical centre.
I'll help you.

577
00:24:27,586 --> 00:24:29,957
If she can't go to school now,
let her join the apprentice class.

578
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,277
I will guide her in her study.

579
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,383
If her parents are busy,
she can stay at our place.

580
00:24:33,466 --> 00:24:34,510
I will take care of her.

581
00:24:36,106 --> 00:24:37,586
If we do that,

582
00:24:38,106 --> 00:24:39,623
do you know how great the risks are?

583
00:24:39,706 --> 00:24:40,706
Yes.

584
00:24:41,106 --> 00:24:42,715
She is my patient in the first place.

585
00:24:43,066 --> 00:24:45,675
Last time, it was because of my mistake
that she almost died.

586
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,934
This time, I must take
full responsibility for her.

587
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,600
No.

588
00:24:52,106 --> 00:24:53,106
Your dad is right.

589
00:24:53,547 --> 00:24:54,852
This is a huge responsibility.

590
00:24:55,706 --> 00:24:57,623
None of us

591
00:24:57,706 --> 00:24:59,272
can keep an eye on her every second.

592
00:24:59,466 --> 00:25:01,336
What if something unexpected
happens to her?

593
00:25:03,466 --> 00:25:04,343
How are we going
to answer to her parents?

594
00:25:04,426 --> 00:25:06,466
Mum, King of Medicine,
Sun Si Miao, once said

595
00:25:06,706 --> 00:25:08,223
that when someone seeks help
for their illness or adversity,

596
00:25:08,306 --> 00:25:09,983
we must not inquire about
their social status or wealth.

597
00:25:10,066 --> 00:25:11,466
All beings are equal.

598
00:25:11,586 --> 00:25:12,904
Our knowledge and action
must be the same.

599
00:25:12,987 --> 00:25:14,507
These are different matters.

600
00:25:16,706 --> 00:25:17,743
How does this girl

601
00:25:17,826 --> 00:25:18,826
look like?

602
00:25:19,547 --> 00:25:20,547
Dad...

603
00:25:22,826 --> 00:25:24,346
From what you've just said,

604
00:25:24,706 --> 00:25:28,023
it seems that this young lady
is both wealthy and beautiful.

605
00:25:28,106 --> 00:25:29,226
Your intentions

606
00:25:29,586 --> 00:25:31,223
are good,

607
00:25:31,306 --> 00:25:33,586
but people may misunderstand that

608
00:25:33,987 --> 00:25:35,147
you have ulterior motives.

609
00:25:36,186 --> 00:25:37,186
Grandpa.

610
00:25:39,513 --> 00:25:40,672
Now he's mad at me.

611
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,560
Hello?

612
00:25:52,586 --> 00:25:53,706
She got arrested again?

613
00:26:09,826 --> 00:26:13,023
Who told me that
she won't involve her master

614
00:26:13,106 --> 00:26:14,426
after committing a wrongdoing?

615
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,717
Who?

616
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,960
No, I mean,

617
00:26:18,872 --> 00:26:20,472
I acted bravely

618
00:26:20,747 --> 00:26:21,867
and did a righteous deed

619
00:26:22,186 --> 00:26:23,466
today.

620
00:26:24,186 --> 00:26:25,946
It's a matter of honour for me.

621
00:26:26,466 --> 00:26:29,547
I'm bringing you along
to share in this glory, you know?

622
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,895
Go home and pack your stuff.

623
00:26:30,978 --> 00:26:32,022
You are staying with us.

624
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,120
Staying with...

625
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,200
No.

626
00:26:38,306 --> 00:26:39,306
No way.

627
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,863
Why should I stay with you?

628
00:26:41,946 --> 00:26:42,863
They...

629
00:26:42,946 --> 00:26:44,106
They, they, they.

630
00:26:44,426 --> 00:26:45,707
They are they, you are you.

631
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:48,372
Let me tell you,

632
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,503
you must be under my surveillance

633
00:26:50,586 --> 00:26:52,223
24 hours a day.

634
00:26:52,306 --> 00:26:53,306
Do you know why?

635
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,778
Helping you become a successor

636
00:26:56,066 --> 00:26:57,466
is an assignment

637
00:26:57,867 --> 00:26:58,983
given to me by my master.

638
00:26:59,066 --> 00:27:00,106
Please don't

639
00:27:00,586 --> 00:27:03,066
give me any extra assignments.

640
00:27:03,426 --> 00:27:04,586
I can't afford to

641
00:27:05,026 --> 00:27:06,306
pay more compensations.

642
00:27:06,426 --> 00:27:08,466
You didn't have to pay a lot today.

643
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,095
I...

644
00:27:11,178 --> 00:27:12,298
Hang on, Master.

645
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:13,544
Master,

646
00:27:13,627 --> 00:27:14,517
if I...

647
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,996
If I don't go back, my best friend...

648
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:18,998
She will think I've gone missing.

649
00:27:19,586 --> 00:27:20,586
Master!

650
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,200
Don't you know how many rooms we have?

651
00:27:28,886 --> 00:27:29,967
Other people

652
00:27:30,466 --> 00:27:32,507
bring home dogs or cats,

653
00:27:32,706 --> 00:27:34,066
while you and your son

654
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,479
bring home people.

655
00:27:39,878 --> 00:27:42,400
With two more people living here,
I have to do more chores.

656
00:27:43,867 --> 00:27:45,027
Both of you

657
00:27:45,346 --> 00:27:47,651
only throw your hands up,
leaving all the jobs for me.

658
00:27:47,946 --> 00:27:49,343
They are big girls.

659
00:27:49,426 --> 00:27:50,687
You don't need to serve them.

660
00:27:51,226 --> 00:27:52,725
They can take care of themselves.

661
00:27:53,627 --> 00:27:54,627
Both of

662
00:27:54,747 --> 00:27:55,747
these girls

663
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,200
are worrisome.

664
00:27:57,946 --> 00:27:59,729
You said they can
take care of themselves.

665
00:28:00,106 --> 00:28:01,586
But I still have to

666
00:28:02,106 --> 00:28:03,103
worry about them.

667
00:28:03,186 --> 00:28:04,814
I have my reasons,

668
00:28:04,897 --> 00:28:06,417
asking Tou Tou to stay with us.

669
00:28:06,946 --> 00:28:08,023
Look at Meng Meng,

670
00:28:08,106 --> 00:28:10,367
she needs someone
to keep an eye on her all the time.

671
00:28:10,826 --> 00:28:13,143
Who can keep an eye on her
when she sleeps at night?

672
00:28:13,226 --> 00:28:16,226
Who in our family
can accompany her all the time?

673
00:28:16,627 --> 00:28:17,667
With Tou Tou around,

674
00:28:18,466 --> 00:28:19,814
they can look after each other.

675
00:28:20,066 --> 00:28:21,066
Sun Tou Tou

676
00:28:21,586 --> 00:28:22,630
has been arrested twice.

677
00:28:23,106 --> 00:28:24,367
And you want to count on her?

678
00:28:25,066 --> 00:28:27,306
I'm with Tou Tou this time.

679
00:28:28,226 --> 00:28:30,140
It's true that
she shouldn't have hit people,

680
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,520
but she was in the right.

681
00:28:36,987 --> 00:28:37,987
All right.

682
00:28:38,306 --> 00:28:39,654
I will move this there for you.

683
00:28:40,826 --> 00:28:41,826
You

684
00:28:41,946 --> 00:28:43,826
don't have the strength to carry stuff.

685
00:28:44,106 --> 00:28:45,706
You might hurt yourself again.

686
00:28:45,987 --> 00:28:47,184
You never consult with me

687
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:48,466
before doing anything.

688
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,399
I know you are a reasonable person.

689
00:28:51,946 --> 00:28:53,586
If we let Tou Tou stay outside,

690
00:28:54,426 --> 00:28:56,623
we will have to make compensation
when she commits wrongdoing.

691
00:28:56,706 --> 00:28:58,663
The money still comes
from your pocket, right?

692
00:29:00,466 --> 00:29:01,987
What does it mean

693
00:29:02,226 --> 00:29:04,066
to follow a master?

694
00:29:04,306 --> 00:29:05,939
What we pursue isn't just knowledge,

695
00:29:06,627 --> 00:29:08,383
but like-mindedness.

696
00:29:08,466 --> 00:29:09,946
Look, I even married you

697
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,211
to be closer to my master.

698
00:29:13,203 --> 00:29:14,426
I ensured that

699
00:29:14,706 --> 00:29:16,343
I live under the same roof as my master.

700
00:29:16,426 --> 00:29:17,383
You see,

701
00:29:17,466 --> 00:29:18,464
if I'm teaching through words and deeds,

702
00:29:18,547 --> 00:29:20,466
I need a recipient for it, don't I?

703
00:29:21,946 --> 00:29:23,066
Ren Xin Zheng.

704
00:29:25,946 --> 00:29:27,251
You called me by my full name.

705
00:29:27,547 --> 00:29:28,946
I think you're mad for real now.

706
00:29:30,466 --> 00:29:31,466
I'm sorry.

707
00:29:32,226 --> 00:29:33,226
Sorry.

708
00:29:35,066 --> 00:29:36,466
Tell me what you did wrong.

709
00:29:38,346 --> 00:29:39,586
This is the fourth

710
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,360
major philosophical question in life.

711
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,296
(The young seedlings are just planted.)

712
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,160
(The crops are newly sown.)

713
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,927
(Spring rain is as precious as oil.)

714
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:18,133
(Grain Rain)

715
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:20,930
What are you doing here?

716
00:30:21,013 --> 00:30:22,863
Haven't you already worked
two night shifts in a row?

717
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:24,863
The flu this time is too severe.

718
00:30:24,946 --> 00:30:26,143
Liu's child is also sick.

719
00:30:26,226 --> 00:30:28,143
There is really no one else
to take over the shift.

720
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:29,103
As a single man,

721
00:30:29,186 --> 00:30:30,103
I have to go

722
00:30:30,186 --> 00:30:31,186
wherever I am needed.

723
00:30:31,426 --> 00:30:33,166
All right. Stay here
and keep watch then.

724
00:30:33,306 --> 00:30:35,480
I'm going to the ward.
It can't be left unattended.

725
00:30:36,066 --> 00:30:36,863
By the way,

726
00:30:36,946 --> 00:30:38,623
pay extra attention
to the child in bed 34

727
00:30:38,706 --> 00:30:39,907
who has pneumonia.

728
00:30:40,226 --> 00:30:41,464
He had a seizure last night.

729
00:30:41,547 --> 00:30:43,437
His mum almost had
a breakdown because of it.

730
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,520
Got it.

731
00:30:51,346 --> 00:30:53,129
Dr Peng, a child needs a lumbar puncture.

732
00:30:53,426 --> 00:30:54,623
Got it. I'll be right over.

733
00:30:54,706 --> 00:30:55,706
Okay.

734
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Jason, right?

735
00:30:58,125 --> 00:30:59,125
I'm Dr Peng.

736
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,023
I will perform
a lumbar puncture on you later.

737
00:31:01,106 --> 00:31:03,889
We'll start by administering
anaesthesia, so it won't be painful.

738
00:31:04,066 --> 00:31:05,466
As a brave man,

739
00:31:05,627 --> 00:31:06,907
you will be brave, right?

740
00:31:07,346 --> 00:31:08,184
You won't cry, right?

741
00:31:08,267 --> 00:31:09,906
Come on, fist bump.

742
00:31:11,586 --> 00:31:13,503
-Step back!
-Mummy! Don't touch me!

743
00:31:13,586 --> 00:31:15,226
What are you doing to my child...

744
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,841
Mummy, I don't want to do this.

745
00:31:19,706 --> 00:31:21,863
Madam, maybe you should
talk to your son first

746
00:31:21,946 --> 00:31:23,251
before we perform the surgery.

747
00:31:24,627 --> 00:31:25,627
Sorry about this.

748
00:31:26,466 --> 00:31:29,226
Jason, you are a good boy, right?

749
00:31:29,946 --> 00:31:30,944
Want to go out and play?

750
00:31:31,027 --> 00:31:32,186
Thanks, Peng.

751
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:35,023
If it weren't for you, I would
have been beaten to death today.

752
00:31:35,106 --> 00:31:36,466
I learned this the hard way.

753
00:31:36,826 --> 00:31:37,826
You are an intern.

754
00:31:37,987 --> 00:31:39,306
You've got a lot to learn.

755
00:31:44,226 --> 00:31:45,226
Meng Meng?

756
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,782
Meng Meng,

757
00:31:46,865 --> 00:31:48,026
do you remember me?

758
00:31:48,547 --> 00:31:50,226
We met at the supermarket before.

759
00:31:50,426 --> 00:31:51,774
I performed acupuncture on you.

760
00:31:52,765 --> 00:31:53,846
I'm Ren Tian Zhen.

761
00:31:54,452 --> 00:31:55,452
Hello.

762
00:31:58,306 --> 00:31:59,867
It's Grain Rain today.

763
00:32:00,226 --> 00:32:02,304
We are going to collect
Grain Rain tea leaves

764
00:32:02,387 --> 00:32:03,743
and maybe view peony flowers.

765
00:32:03,826 --> 00:32:05,106
It's going to be fun.

766
00:32:05,826 --> 00:32:07,174
Would you like to come with us?

767
00:32:09,946 --> 00:32:11,706
You see, we are ready to depart now.

768
00:32:11,946 --> 00:32:12,946
Come with us.

769
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:16,466
Come.

770
00:32:16,826 --> 00:32:17,826
Don't be afraid.

771
00:32:23,987 --> 00:32:24,987
Easy.

772
00:32:27,627 --> 00:32:29,410
You see, it's right there.
Let's go there.

773
00:32:35,066 --> 00:32:36,066
Mrs Xu,

774
00:32:36,226 --> 00:32:37,787
park your car outside later.

775
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,360
We will go by the bus.

776
00:32:40,946 --> 00:32:42,223
Why isn't Mr Xu here?

777
00:32:42,306 --> 00:32:44,464
He made an emergency trip
to the United States last night.

778
00:32:44,547 --> 00:32:46,461
(Du Cai Qing)
He will come back this weekend.

779
00:32:48,872 --> 00:32:50,743
Please tell him

780
00:32:50,826 --> 00:32:51,947
to come right away

781
00:32:52,086 --> 00:32:53,485
when he comes back.

782
00:32:53,867 --> 00:32:55,267
This is very important.

783
00:32:56,426 --> 00:32:57,426
Dr Song,

784
00:32:58,066 --> 00:32:59,066
sorry about this,

785
00:32:59,426 --> 00:33:00,706
but I have to leave too.

786
00:33:01,106 --> 00:33:02,023
Here's the thing.

787
00:33:02,106 --> 00:33:03,626
We received a sudden notification

788
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,143
that there are fire hazards
at our exhibition next month.

789
00:33:06,226 --> 00:33:08,023
My paintings are too valuable.

790
00:33:08,106 --> 00:33:10,454
I have to go back and
keep an eye on things personally.

791
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,860
Didn't you say

792
00:33:11,943 --> 00:33:13,944
this treatment requires
both parents to be present?

793
00:33:14,027 --> 00:33:15,383
You see, Xu isn't here too.

794
00:33:15,466 --> 00:33:16,503
When he comes back,

795
00:33:16,586 --> 00:33:17,586
we will come together.

796
00:33:21,706 --> 00:33:23,106
Meng Meng is your child.

797
00:33:23,627 --> 00:33:25,064
If you prioritize all the things

798
00:33:25,147 --> 00:33:26,706
ahead of your child,

799
00:33:26,946 --> 00:33:28,381
then there is nothing I can't do.

800
00:33:29,186 --> 00:33:31,586
But life is not a television program

801
00:33:32,526 --> 00:33:33,886
that can be replayed.

802
00:33:34,706 --> 00:33:36,466
Time moves on linearly.

803
00:33:37,532 --> 00:33:39,365
It can't be paused indefinitely
for anyone.

804
00:33:47,826 --> 00:33:49,064
Let's go, Meng Meng.
It's okay.

805
00:33:49,147 --> 00:33:50,495
Let me introduce my classmates.

806
00:33:53,186 --> 00:33:54,186
It's okay.

807
00:33:54,387 --> 00:33:55,557
-Don't be afraid.
-Hi, Meng Meng.

808
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:57,477
You see, you've met him last time.

809
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,560
Meng Meng.

810
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,750
-Hi, Meng Meng.
-Zhao Li Quan.

811
00:33:59,833 --> 00:34:01,193
We've met before. Remember me?

812
00:34:01,547 --> 00:34:03,507
-At the supermarket.
-What is his name?

813
00:34:04,147 --> 00:34:05,147
I'm Zhao Li Quan.

814
00:34:05,387 --> 00:34:08,024
Yes. Meng Meng, don't be afraid.
It's okay.

815
00:34:08,107 --> 00:34:09,238
He's my friend. It's okay.

816
00:34:10,547 --> 00:34:11,383
Relax. It's fine.

817
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:14,264
Meng Meng, you're finally here!

818
00:34:14,347 --> 00:34:15,744
Hold on, hold on, Tou Tou.

819
00:34:15,827 --> 00:34:17,623
-Don't you remember me, Meng Meng?
-Meng Meng, listen.

820
00:34:17,706 --> 00:34:20,103
-Don't you remember me, Meng Meng?
-She's the girl who was more manly than

821
00:34:20,186 --> 00:34:21,197
the boys in the supermarket last time.

822
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,984
Remember her?
You've met before, Meng Meng.

823
00:34:23,067 --> 00:34:23,984
It's me.

824
00:34:24,067 --> 00:34:25,067
She's Sun Tou Tou.

825
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:28,666
Hang on.

826
00:34:29,307 --> 00:34:30,237
Meng Meng,

827
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,424
don't worry.

828
00:34:31,507 --> 00:34:33,383
Don't mind these annoying boys.

829
00:34:33,466 --> 00:34:34,823
If you need anything,

830
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:35,906
just come to me.

831
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,863
We are roommates starting today.
We're going to live together!

832
00:34:38,946 --> 00:34:40,704
What are you talking about, Sun Tou Tou?

833
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:41,823
She's scared!

834
00:34:41,906 --> 00:34:42,783
-Knock it off.
-Scared of what?

835
00:34:42,866 --> 00:34:43,664
-Give me a hug!
-Leave her alone.

836
00:34:43,747 --> 00:34:44,747
I'm your roommate.

837
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,520
It is the middle of March.

838
00:34:56,799 --> 00:34:58,880
The garden is green with flowers.

839
00:34:59,107 --> 00:35:00,934
The morning doves
are singing in the house,

840
00:35:01,107 --> 00:35:02,946
indulging in spring sleep by the window.

841
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,520
The cooing dove flaps its wings,
indicating the arrival of Grain Rain.

842
00:35:09,226 --> 00:35:10,226
Nephew.

843
00:35:11,347 --> 00:35:12,347
Nephew.

844
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,520
The ancients said
we should indulge in spring sleep,

845
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:18,063
but here I am, picking tea leaves
early in the morning,

846
00:35:18,146 --> 00:35:19,666
I can't even open my eyes.

847
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,919
She has been

848
00:35:24,666 --> 00:35:26,866
finding more ways
to use your words against you.

849
00:35:29,223 --> 00:35:30,103
In that case,

850
00:35:30,186 --> 00:35:31,795
it seems like I do need to read more.

851
00:35:32,386 --> 00:35:34,303
If I had known this poem earlier,

852
00:35:34,386 --> 00:35:35,821
I wouldn't have to wake up early.

853
00:35:36,107 --> 00:35:37,666
That's right.

854
00:35:38,146 --> 00:35:39,587
You should read more.

855
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
You see,

856
00:35:41,146 --> 00:35:42,626
you can even quote classics

857
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,219
when you are arguing.

858
00:35:49,192 --> 00:35:50,313
There is a flower here.

859
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,800
Leave it.

860
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,825
In the three months of spring,

861
00:35:56,906 --> 00:35:57,946
do not kill the living,

862
00:35:59,107 --> 00:36:00,107
What does that mean?

863
00:36:15,706 --> 00:36:16,706
Meng Meng,

864
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,060
are you feeling cold?

865
00:36:20,747 --> 00:36:21,747
Here. Put this on.

866
00:36:27,747 --> 00:36:28,747
What are you doing?

867
00:36:30,987 --> 00:36:31,987
Zhen Zhen,

868
00:36:32,307 --> 00:36:33,426
what are you doing here?

869
00:36:34,666 --> 00:36:35,783
I feel really cold too.

870
00:36:35,866 --> 00:36:37,432
Do you have any more clothes for me?

871
00:36:37,666 --> 00:36:38,543
No.

872
00:36:38,626 --> 00:36:39,823
Just hold yourself tight.

873
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:40,823
You will be fine.

874
00:36:40,906 --> 00:36:42,664
No.

875
00:36:42,747 --> 00:36:45,667
Tou Tou, the way you talk is a bit...

876
00:36:45,805 --> 00:36:48,303
Come on, Li Quan,

877
00:36:48,386 --> 00:36:50,427
the wind is so strong.

878
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,040
So strong. I'm weak.

879
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,157
When the wind blows,

880
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,543
I feel so sad.

881
00:36:55,626 --> 00:36:57,466
You just don't understand me.

882
00:37:01,186 --> 00:37:02,583
What's wrong with you guys?

883
00:37:02,666 --> 00:37:04,146
What is the meaning of this?

884
00:37:05,307 --> 00:37:06,583
I'm also girl.

885
00:37:06,666 --> 00:37:08,587
What's wrong with me feeling cold?

886
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:15,680
This is annoying!

887
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,294
Meng Meng, let me help you.

888
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,960
Let's go.

889
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,960
Come on.

890
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,480
I'm leaving then.

891
00:37:39,827 --> 00:37:41,146
You're so disgusting.

892
00:37:49,666 --> 00:37:50,666
Ren Tian Zhen,

893
00:37:51,146 --> 00:37:52,225
have you lost your mind?

894
00:37:53,706 --> 00:37:56,224
Why are you so double-standard?

895
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:59,107
You help everyone with
their baskets, except for me!

896
00:37:59,466 --> 00:38:00,466
You can't catch me.

897
00:38:03,067 --> 00:38:04,103
-Keep running.
-What are you doing?

898
00:38:04,186 --> 00:38:05,627
-Keep running.
-You...

899
00:38:06,426 --> 00:38:07,426
Wait.

900
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:13,119
Ling Ian!

901
00:38:14,706 --> 00:38:16,386
Ling Ian, thank goodness I caught you.

902
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,390
Otherwise, you would've fallen
into the pot,

903
00:38:18,747 --> 00:38:19,747
right?

904
00:38:21,307 --> 00:38:22,386
Let go, let go.

905
00:38:23,906 --> 00:38:24,906
Tou Tou.

906
00:38:26,107 --> 00:38:27,706
Don't be impulsive.

907
00:38:27,987 --> 00:38:29,904
No, Master, look at him.

908
00:38:29,987 --> 00:38:31,143
He carried the basket

909
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:32,424
for every girl,

910
00:38:32,507 --> 00:38:33,383
but he wouldn't carry mine.

911
00:38:33,466 --> 00:38:34,704
-Why did he do that?
-You haven't paid back

912
00:38:34,787 --> 00:38:36,259
for Meng Meng's dad's glasses.

913
00:38:40,839 --> 00:38:41,839
Behave yourself.

914
00:38:48,587 --> 00:38:50,067
Come here. Fry the tea leaves.

915
00:38:50,747 --> 00:38:51,747
Coming.

916
00:38:52,192 --> 00:38:53,192
Leave this task

917
00:38:53,906 --> 00:38:55,386
to a chef.

918
00:38:55,706 --> 00:38:56,664
Are you okay, Mum?

919
00:38:56,747 --> 00:38:57,747
I'm fine.

920
00:38:58,547 --> 00:38:59,547
Dad is impressive.

921
00:39:01,426 --> 00:39:02,426
Very impressive.

922
00:39:06,992 --> 00:39:07,992
Go get another pot.

923
00:39:08,386 --> 00:39:09,386
Okay.

924
00:39:28,706 --> 00:39:29,706
Tou Tou.

925
00:39:29,906 --> 00:39:31,906
Tou Tou, come here.

926
00:39:32,386 --> 00:39:33,386
Come look at this.

927
00:39:36,587 --> 00:39:37,587
Hurry.

928
00:39:37,827 --> 00:39:38,827
Look at that.

929
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:44,355
It's the Milky Way.

930
00:39:44,438 --> 00:39:45,840
-Isn't it beautiful?
-Yes.

931
00:39:53,827 --> 00:39:55,426
I heard it.

932
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,641
You can even sing

933
00:40:00,005 --> 00:40:02,285
in different vocal parts?

934
00:40:03,587 --> 00:40:06,067
How do you sing so beautifully?

935
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,881
Who's singing?

936
00:40:10,073 --> 00:40:11,063
Who's singing?

937
00:40:11,146 --> 00:40:13,186
Everything is singing.

938
00:40:14,386 --> 00:40:16,107
They have spirituality.

939
00:40:16,987 --> 00:40:19,307
The way you talk to them,

940
00:40:20,107 --> 00:40:22,386
and your attitude towards them,

941
00:40:23,146 --> 00:40:24,186
they know it.

942
00:40:27,579 --> 00:40:28,579
Tou Tou,

943
00:40:28,906 --> 00:40:30,426
can you locate the Big Dipper?

944
00:40:31,466 --> 00:40:33,587
Don't be silly, my dear nephew.

945
00:40:34,067 --> 00:40:35,224
If I could find the Big Dipper,

946
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:37,143
would I have gotten lost
on the mountain that time?

947
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:38,543
Would I not have found my way back?

948
00:40:38,626 --> 00:40:40,266
I will show you. Watch.

949
00:40:40,653 --> 00:40:41,740
The brightest ones there.

950
00:40:42,226 --> 00:40:47,226
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

951
00:40:48,706 --> 00:40:50,264
Picture it in your mind.

952
00:40:50,347 --> 00:40:52,866
Imagine the Big Dipper

953
00:40:53,547 --> 00:40:55,107
as a clock.

954
00:40:56,666 --> 00:40:59,863
When the Big Dipper points to Chen,

955
00:40:59,946 --> 00:41:01,164
it's the time of Grain Rain.

956
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:04,186
-Chen?
-That's right.

957
00:41:04,987 --> 00:41:05,987
What time is that?

958
00:41:06,626 --> 00:41:07,987
From 7am to 9am,

959
00:41:08,587 --> 00:41:09,866
when you have breakfast.

960
00:41:10,987 --> 00:41:12,543
But why is it called Grain Rain?

961
00:41:12,626 --> 00:41:13,626
It's not raining here.

962
00:41:14,386 --> 00:41:16,426
It will rain at night.

963
00:41:17,107 --> 00:41:19,347
Grain Rain brings rain,

964
00:41:19,906 --> 00:41:21,107
indicating a good harvest.

965
00:41:24,499 --> 00:41:26,096
