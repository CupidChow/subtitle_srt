1
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,009
Try it and tell me how you feel.

2
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,040
I'm not well-versed in this field.
I cannot tell if it's good or bad.

3
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,320
It doesn't matter if you can't tell
whether the tea is good or bad.

4
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,880
However, you need to be able to
differentiate between right and wrong.

5
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,440
Do you have something to tell me?

6
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:49,560
No.

7
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,360
Is there something you want to tell me?

8
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,680
What do you want to hear, Mr Ren?

9
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,320
What are

10
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,440
people made up of?

11
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,760
Good and bad.

12
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,520
That's right.

13
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,640
Yin and Yang.

14
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,760
In fact, throughout our lives,

15
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,880
we may have many evil thoughts.

16
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,040
Even in marriage,

17
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:35,040
there may be countless times
when we want to kill the other person.

18
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,240
But when you turn around to grab a gun,
you suddenly notice

19
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,840
a rose

20
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,520
on the windowsill.

21
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,800
You decide to pick it

22
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,440
and give it to the other person.

23
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,400
Mr Ren, forgive my ignorance.

24
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,960
I don't understand.

25
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,840
If a person has a conscience,

26
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,200
I believe they won't go too far astray.

27
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,357
If you have something you want

28
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,240
to say to me today,

29
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,320
say it

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,800
now.

31
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,800
I'll bear the responsibility for you.

32
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,880
If you think you haven't deviated
from the right path,

33
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,120
you can leave.

34
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,640
-Mr Ren...
-Think before you speak.

35
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,957
Every word you say

36
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,120
will have consequences.

37
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,560
Think it through.

38
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,040
I have nothing to say.

39
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,280
Your teacher, Wu Shan Dao,

40
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,320
copied a poem for me

41
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,960
when I was established the class.

42
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,360
It's right over there.

43
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,760
Open it

44
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,400
and read it out.

45
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,760
Good and evil are manifested

46
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,480
in our actions.

47
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,840
Through these actions, we distinguish
between the petty and the noble.

48
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,520
A noble person seeks to amend their
misguided plans without causing harm,

49
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,360
while one who remains lost and
unrepentant becomes a petty person.

50
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,080
A good medicine proves
its efficacy in treating illnesses,

51
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,600
just as an unblemished jade
is cherished for its purity.

52
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,640
To become an exemplary individual,
one must strive for refinement.

53
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,880
How can one not seek redemption
after making mistakes?

54
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,040
It's a good poem.

55
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,640
A good one.

56
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,880
"Admonitions for My Son" by
Shao Yong of the Northern Song Dynasty.

57
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,480
Mr Ren,

58
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,760
I made mistakes.

59
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,080
Goodbye.

60
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,160
Thank you, doctor.

61
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,997
-Thank you, doctor.
-Go and get some rest.

62
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:02,717
-Okay.
-Go on.

63
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,160
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

64
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,840
Hello, Mr He.

65
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,920
(Miracle Doctor, I need help.)

66
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,400
What's wrong? Take it easy.

67
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,520
Tell me what happened.

68
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,640
These past few days
have been really strange.

69
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,120
Many of my patients here
have caught a cold.

70
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,997
I've been giving them the same
medication I usually prescribe for flu.

71
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,400
But it doesn't seem to be effective.
Especially Uncle Niu,

72
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,317
he's been coughing for several days
and doesn't seem to be getting better.

73
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,200
Just now, he even had trouble breathing.
I'm really worried.

74
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,237
Calm down.
What are Uncle Niu's symptoms?

75
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,080
What medications did
you prescribe for him?

76
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,277
It's really weird.

77
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,157
Some people have a cold, some
are coughing, some have a fever,

78
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,520
and some say they can't taste anything
when they eat.

79
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,680
(I prescribed)

80
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,317
(powder of honeysuckle and forsythia,)

81
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,237
ginseng toxin-vanquishing powder
and various herbal soups here,

82
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,560
but none of them seem to work.

83
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,360
(What should I do?)

84
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,717
Can you come over?

85
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,680
I'm really desperate.

86
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:32,880
Mr He.

87
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,437
Tao Zi, why are you here?

88
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,757
Grandma caught a cold
in the provincial capital.

89
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,957
Dad took her to the hospital there.

90
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,757
The queue was so long that people
were even lining up on the street.

91
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,997
(We couldn't even get
a registration number.)

92
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,477
Dad told me to hurry back and find you.

93
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,117
I see. Ask Mrs He to go with you.

94
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,317
Go get her now. Hurry up.

95
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,200
Okay.

96
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,037
Miracle Doctor,

97
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,200
can you come here
to provide consultations?

98
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,520
(I'm overwhelmed here.
And it's untreatable.)

99
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,597
You are the most respected doctor here.

100
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,200
Everyone trusts you.

101
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,840
If you come, half of the patients
will recover.

102
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,280
Okay, Mr He.

103
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,877
Don't worry. I'll pack my things.

104
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,320
I will be there as soon as I can.

105
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,840
Okay. There are too many patients here.

106
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,000
Can your girlfriend come along?

107
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,317
She has something to attend to.

108
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,480
I'll go alone.

109
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,440
(Okay. Please come as soon as you can.
Thank you.)

110
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,320
What's going on?

111
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,240
This is the Year of the Metal Rat.
The Five Elements and Six Qi

112
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,197
indicate an excessive presence
of metal energy.

113
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,080
There might be a major epidemic.

114
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,760
Ask Xin Zheng and the others

115
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,840
to prepare more medicine.

116
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,480
Do you have any idea
how serious this is?

117
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:39,960
Say something!

118
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,360
Mr Ren, I know I was wrong.

119
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,360
Mr Wu said to me before,

120
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,680
"Li Quan,

121
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,360
you have to go back to
the apprentice class.

122
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,480
You can't forget
your original aspiration."

123
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,360
I've been asking myself.

124
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,600
I said,

125
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,680
"Zhao Li Quan,

126
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,760
what is your original aspiration?"

127
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,680
I want to become a doctor.

128
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,637
I want to provide

129
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,880
a better life for my family.

130
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,720
But I can't go back anymore.

131
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,920
Forget about being a doctor,

132
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,240
you're not even being
a decent human being!

133
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,120
If I report you now,

134
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,240
you'll be put behind bars immediately,
you know?

135
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,240
For the rest of your life,
you will carry

136
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,480
the guilt of corruption, bribery,

137
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,000
and abuse of power.

138
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,720
Your parents and your relatives

139
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,880
will be ashamed because of you.

140
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,200
Mr Ren,

141
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,200
you have to help me.

142
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,360
Please help me.

143
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,160
I have learned my lesson.

144
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,960
Mr Ren, please help me.

145
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,720
Please help me.

146
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,200
I have learned my lesson, Mr Ren.

147
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,640
I have learned my lesson.

148
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,480
Turn yourself in.

149
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,037
You had the courage
to commit those acts.

150
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,160
You should also have the courage
to admit them.

151
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,840
Be responsible for your actions.

152
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,160
Please give me another chance.

153
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,680
Help me.

154
00:10:24,186 --> 00:10:25,266
Help me.

155
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,200
If my parents and my village
find out about this, I'll be ruined.

156
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,720
How will I live then?

157
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,120
I beg you,

158
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,000
please help me.

159
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,560
Help me.

160
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,760
You are responsible

161
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,120
for your own actions.

162
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,760
If you turn yourself in now,

163
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,160
you will get a lenient sentence.

164
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,200
If I report you,

165
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,080
the punishment will be even harsher.

166
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,680
Now that I know about what you did,

167
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,760
I can't pretend I don't know.

168
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,000
How about this?

169
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,720
Why don't you knock me out

170
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,837
until I lose my memory too?

171
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,240
This way, only you, the heavens,
and the earth will know,

172
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,600
and no one else.

173
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,200
Mr Ren, please don't say that.

174
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,200
I won't do it again.

175
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,997
I won't do it again.

176
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,200
I'm sorry.

177
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,920
You know,

178
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,520
I'm helping you.

179
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,200
After you turn yourself in,

180
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,920
I will bring you food.

181
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,040
Li Quan,

182
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,320
do you hate me?

183
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,200
Master,

184
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,680
I don't hate you.

185
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,360
I'm grateful to you.

186
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,920
This has been weighing on
my heart for a long time,

187
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,120
like a big rock.

188
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,200
It feels so much better
to finally tell someone.

189
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,320
That's good to hear.

190
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,280
Go and turn yourself in.

191
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,240
I will visit you.

192
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,480
Go.

193
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,720
-Mr Ren.
-(He left.)

194
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,080
I saw it.

195
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:24,920
Follow him.

196
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,160
(Got it.)

197
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,400
Hello?

198
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,520
(Mr Ren,)

199
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,520
(he didn't enter the police station.)

200
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,520
Where is he going?

201
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,360
I don't know.

202
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,560
Keep following him.

203
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,240
What happened?

204
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,720
He jumped into the river.

205
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,320
I saved him.

206
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,280
Leave us.

207
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,400
You have the courage
to kill yourself.

208
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,840
Why don't you have the determination
to change and start afresh?

209
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,400
Mr Ren,

210
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,000
I'm ashamed.

211
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,040
It's too late for me go back.

212
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,880
The scoundrel you used to be

213
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,600
is already dead in the river.

214
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,200
From now on, sitting in front of me

215
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,000
is a completely transformed person,

216
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,160
ready to start anew.

217
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,520
Can you do it?

218
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,440
Yes.

219
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,960
Are you sure it's just 300,000 yuan?

220
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:09,880
Yes.

221
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,720
I will lend you the money.

222
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,800
Take the money

223
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,160
and pay him back.

224
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,760
This way, you can start anew

225
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,160
with ease.

226
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,280
Do you know

227
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,120
how hard it is to cultivate a talent?

228
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:37,800
They have to go through various tests.

229
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,240
Some people fail in their tests.

230
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,120
That's why everyone

231
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,520
should have a mentor
to keep them company

232
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,360
on their journey.

233
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,237
If someone falls behind,

234
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,680
they can lend them a helping hand

235
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,200
and keep moving forward.

236
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,960
I hope

237
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,360
you would take this as a lesson,

238
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,680
learn from your mistakes,

239
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,440
and strive for greater goodness.

240
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,120
Thank you, Mr Ren.

241
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,040
Starting from tomorrow,

242
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,037
you'll return to work
at the medical centre.

243
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,360
You'll receive a basic salary.

244
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,080
You will start

245
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,880
as a herb collector.

246
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,480
Forget about being a doctor for now.

247
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,517
You need to understand
the spirit of craftsmanship

248
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,160
before you can think about other things.

249
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,160
I will work hard.

250
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,000
Tian Zhen is now...

251
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,680
We will see if we can
add another bed in the room.

252
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,877
There are many herbs in there.

253
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,477
You will work in the medical centre
during the day,

254
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,360
at night,

255
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,120
you will organise the herb.

256
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,600
That is learning too.

257
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,080
I have a place to stay now.

258
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,037
I just rented a room.

259
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,400
I've paid three months' rent.

260
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,160
Why are you still hesitating then?

261
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,117
There's something
I've been unable to understand.

262
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:00,997
I'd like to ask you.

263
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:01,880
Go on.

264
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,040
You taught us that,

265
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,597
"Given enough honesty,
there will be intelligence;

266
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,480
given enough intelligence,
there will be honesty."

267
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,880
Honesty is the foremost principle
in being a person.

268
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,280
I've been your student
for quite a long time.

269
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,920
I've been observing your actions
and behaviour for a long time,

270
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,280
but I still can't figure it out.

271
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,120
What is it?

272
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,320
Your relationship with Tou Tou

273
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,640
is not what people think it is, right?

274
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,840
I am a mortal.

275
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,360
And being a mortal,

276
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,440
I am bound to be lost at times.

277
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,200
Because I have experienced
the hardships of mortals,

278
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,000
I can understand your mistakes.

279
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,880
Everyone makes mistakes.

280
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,280
Throughout our life,

281
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,240
we are constantly refining ourselves,

282
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,400
striving to improve.

283
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,560
It is important to understand ourselves,

284
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,040
reflect on ourselves,

285
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,880
and then improve ourselves.

286
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,720
Thank you for your guidance.

287
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,640
(Jiangzhou People's Hospital)

288
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,880
Hello, Grandson. What's up?

289
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,120
Tou Tou,

290
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,080
I'm returning to the village
to provide free consultations.

291
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,200
Why? What happened?

292
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,757
The flu has been rampant lately.

293
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,000
Mr He asked me to go and help out,
to take a look.

294
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,960
When will you be back then?

295
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,517
If everything goes well,
three to five days.

296
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,480
But if there are
any unforeseen circumstances,

297
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,120
it might take ten days to two weeks.

298
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,877
(Remember to switch shifts
with Yang Xiao Hong.)

299
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,357
I've also asked Wu Yu for a favour.

300
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,600
He will join the rotation team.
He's reliable.

301
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,760
I got it.

302
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,640
Tou Tou,

303
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,600
do you remember my grandpa's
old house, the one I told you about?

304
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,920
(I cleaned it up.)

305
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,320
The key is in
the water meter box at the door.

306
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,400
If you ever feel tired

307
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,280
and don't feel like going home,
you can stay there.

308
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,800
(Don't always trouble Xing Xing.)

309
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:50,840
Okay.

310
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,840
(Well, if there's nothing else,)

311
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,440
(I have to go.)

312
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,120
Hang on.

313
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,000
Stay safe.

314
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,400
Okay, bye.

315
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:04,840
Bye.

316
00:23:58,840 --> 00:23:59,640
Come, come.

317
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,600
Madam, why did you move here?

318
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,440
There are too many patients.

319
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,920
When they heard you were coming,

320
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,200
they all came to us.

321
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,357
The village

322
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,080
vacated the ancestral hall for us.

323
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,800
Madam,

324
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,557
my grandfather said
this year is a year of epidemic.

325
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,957
I brought some herb sachets.
They must be hung up promptly.

326
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,397
I also brought
some herbal medicine soup.

327
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,717
Make sure everyone in the village
to take it in a timely manner.

328
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,877
Okay, okay.

329
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,400
Come on. Come with me.

330
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,680
Here, this way.

331
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,600
Easy.

332
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,520
Mr He.

333
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,400
-You're here.
-I'm here.

334
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,360
Your liver is not good.

335
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,640
-How's your rest been lately?
-Not very good.

336
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,320
Don't overexert yourself.

337
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:41,920
Mr He, allow me.

338
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,720
Dr Ren will take a look at you.

339
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,997
-Hello, Dr Ren.
-Hello.

340
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:45,880
Sit here.

341
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,600
-What's your surname?
-Ye.

342
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,040
How old are you?

343
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,520
41.

344
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:53,880
Let's see.

345
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,240
Please open your mouth.
Let me see your tongue.

346
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,240
Okay.

347
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,880
A few more to go.

348
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,000
Hurry.

349
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,720
How's your sleep been?

350
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:24,960
Not really good.

351
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,640
Please open your mouth.
Let me see your tongue.

352
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:28,920
Wider.

353
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,040
Grandpa,

354
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,960
I have a bad feeling about this.

355
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,717
Everyone's tongue coating
is very white and greasy.

356
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,117
The level of greasiness is alarming.

357
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,440
The Right Cun is slippery.

358
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,360
I have prescribed many medications,
but there's no improvement.

359
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,200
It's effective,

360
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,400
but the symptoms recur.

361
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,520
The illness is prolonged.

362
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:50,080
(During the periods of
Minor Cold and Major Cold,)

363
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,800
(it is generally
the coldest time of the year.)

364
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,677
(As the saying goes,
Minor Cold is between)

365
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,120
(the second and third nine-day period,)

366
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,280
(it's so cold that
one shivers from head to toe.)

367
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,520
(Minor Cold)

368
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,437
You still don't have a sense of smell?

369
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,240
Yes, I still can't taste anything
when eating.

370
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,960
Dr Ren! Dr Ren!

371
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,560
Calm down, Tao Zi.

372
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,480
What's wrong? Is it Grandma again?

373
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,920
No, not Grandma.

374
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:36,917
It's Uncle Niu.

375
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,960
Go and check on him.

376
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,000
-Okay, I will go check on him now.
-Go.

377
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,760
-Let's go.
-Okay.

378
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,920
-Collect your medicine outside.
-Thank you.

379
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,040
Come, come.

380
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,400
Is it your old ailment?

381
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,560
-How is your blood pressure?
-It's okay.

382
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,280
My cough

383
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,480
has gotten better,

384
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,840
but it gets worse at night.

385
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,520
I had a slight fever

386
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,560
when I woke up this morning.

387
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,040
Dr Ren,

388
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,720
I actually felt better earlier.

389
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,120
Maybe...

390
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,757
I... I think

391
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,840
maybe I got a little tired
over the past few days.

392
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,480
Besides,

393
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,000
at my age...

394
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,360
It takes longer

395
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,920
for me to recover from a cold.

396
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:45,920
I'm fine.

397
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,240
No, you are not.

398
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,040
You almost fell down just now.

399
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,640
I felt a little dizzy for a few seconds.

400
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,597
I really am fine.

401
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,517
How are you fine?

402
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,720
Huai told me to take good care of you
before he's admitted to the hospital.

403
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,117
If something happens to you,
what am I going to say to him?

404
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,600
Who was admitted to the hospital?

405
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,720
My son.

406
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,600
He fell ill after he
came back from Wuhan.

407
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,120
He is

408
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,840
in the district hospital now.

409
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,400
What did the hospital say?

410
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,440
The doctor said

411
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,360
he was fine.

412
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,440
A few days of IV drip

413
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,440
will cure him.

414
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,640
How long ago was this?

415
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,320
It has been a few days.

416
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,637
Come here!

417
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,800
Tian Zhen is calling.

418
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,237
Tian Zhen is calling?

419
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,120
Give it to me.

420
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,600
Tian Zhen,

421
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,400
(how have you been doing?)

422
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,440
(Chinese New Year is approaching.
You should come home soon.)

423
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,800
(Tian Zhen.)

424
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,680
Mum, let me talk to Grandpa.
I have something urgent to ask him.

425
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,840
I'm here. Yes?

426
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,357
(Grandpa, here's the thing.)

427
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,637
(I can't go home for now.)

428
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,757
I have never seen
such a complex situation before,

429
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,277
so I need your help to sort it out.

430
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,957
Do you remember what the situation
was like during the SARS outbreak?

431
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,360
Your parents took the lead at that time.

432
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,760
Come. Ling Lan, you talk to him.

433
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,477
(Tell me about the situation.)

434
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,600
Mum, my patients' high fever
isn't going down.

435
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,560
I tried using a combination
of Maxing Shigan soup

436
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,480
(and modified Xiaochaihu decoction,)

437
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,517
(but it only provides temporary relief.
The illness is prolonged.)

438
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,757
(Even in the early stages,
it comes on aggressively.)

439
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,397
(I've advised two patients to go
directly to the general hospital.)

440
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,480
So, I wanted to ask
what it was like during SARS.

441
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,560
The illness is now spreading in Wuhan.

442
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,320
I'm getting a bit worried.

443
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,637
You can't handle it alone.

444
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:37,840
(Come home now.)

445
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,000
Grandpa, they need me here.
I can't go home.

446
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,157
You brat,

447
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,760
you never suffered from this before.

448
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,320
(During the SARS outbreak,)

449
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,877
(one of your mum's best friends)

450
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,080
(got infected and died.)

451
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,360
(You are our only grandchild.)

452
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,120
Tian Zhen,

453
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,886
come home.

454
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:55,036
We will talk about it
when you come home.

455
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:55,920
(Tian Zhen.)

456
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,157
(Tian Zhen,)

457
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,317
give me a day. I will get prepared.
I will be there tomorrow afternoon.

458
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,440
Text me the address.

459
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,080
(Okay, Dad.)

460
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,640
He's going too?

461
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,720
Tian Zhen, listen to me.

462
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,560
(Be sure to always wear a mask.)

463
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,840
Also, the prescribed herbal decoction
needs to be taken three times a day.

464
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,757
I'll ask your dad
to bring some more over.

465
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,597
Even those who haven't fallen ill
should drink it as well.

466
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,480
Got it?

467
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,837
Got it, Mum. I will.

468
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,720
I have to go now.

469
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,997
What kind of mother are you?

470
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,680
What if it really is SARS?

471
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,600
The SARS outbreak
was so severe back then.

472
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,840
Didn't you also send
your own daughter to the front line?

473
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,120
Tian Zhen is a doctor.

474
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,680
This is when his skills
should be put to use.

475
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:43,880
This is odd.

476
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,640
I could bear

477
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,200
to let my daughter go,

478
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,520
yet I can't bear to let my grandson go.

479
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,160
Look after the medical centre.

480
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,120
It's difficult for us to know

481
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,960
when this disease will reach Jiangzhou.

482
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,960
Take stock of the masks.

483
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:12,760
Easy.

484
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,400
Those who have a fever,
separate them with other patients.

485
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,757
Here.

486
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:18,840
I have already placed

487
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,080
a large order
for anti-epidemic medicines.

488
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,240
Put it here.

489
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,640
Anything else?

490
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,920
No, just these few little bags.

491
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,240
If there is a major outbreak,

492
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,797
our medical centre will immediately
prepare the medicine

493
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,117
and distribute it for free.

494
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,800
I want all the patients and
their families to have access to it.

495
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,520
-Professor Ren...
-Hold on, let me think.

496
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:40,920
What else is there?

497
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,597
Why do you insist on leaving overnight?

498
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,117
It would be much better to bring
a student with you tomorrow morning.

499
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,920
You can take turns driving on the way.

500
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,400
No need. It should be fine.

501
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,920
I can just use GPS.

502
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,160
Okay, go home.

503
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,237
Okay.

504
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,400
-Okay.
-Take care.

505
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,237
-I'm leaving.
-Drive slowly.

506
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,320
Be careful.

507
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,680
Professor Ren,

508
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,080
I'm so glad you came.

509
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,600
Where is Tian Zhen?

510
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,800
Tian Zhen took
Uncle Niu to the county town.

511
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,077
I'm worried he can't make it.

512
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,440
Uncle Niu's condition is critical.

513
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,200
Why did he seek treatment so late?

514
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,120
It's not Tian Zhen's fault.

515
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,400
It's mainly Uncle Niu's fault.

516
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,160
He's reluctant to spend money.

517
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,797
He's a really good doctor.

518
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,157
It's not easy to invite him.

519
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,317
The password is six zeroes.

520
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,680
The money inside is enough.

521
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,440
Get someone to send this card to him.

522
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,317
Look at him.

523
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,320
He's so cool.

524
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,517
He is a famous doctor, a great doctor.

525
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,440
Of course he's cool.

526
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,440
-I will go take a look.
-Okay.

527
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,778
It's Xin Zheng.

528
00:36:11,793 --> 00:36:12,782
Master.

529
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,400
(Xin Zheng.)

530
00:36:14,887 --> 00:36:16,287
I wrote a prescription

531
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,960
based on the situation.

532
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,720
I've sent it to you.

533
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,360
What do you think about it?

534
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,320
I've looked at it.

535
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,477
The dosage of Ephedra sinica

536
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,760
is a bit too high.

537
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,237
If the dosage is too high,

538
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,440
it will affect sleep.

539
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,077
Only with proper rest

540
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,400
(can the patient recover quickly)

541
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,880
(and self-heal.)

542
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,440
Got it, Master. I'll keep it in mind.

543
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,160
How's the medical centre?

544
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,200
How is Ling Lan?

545
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,520
(We are doing good.)

546
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,440
Don't worry.

547
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,440
At your age,

548
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,920
you still have to help out
in the medical centre.

549
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,520
Don't say that.

550
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,120
Take care of yourself.

551
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,200
Okay, I will.

552
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,600
Don't worry.

553
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:54,960
Okay.

554
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,000
Bye.

555
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,520
Dad, Dad.

556
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,480
Something happened.

557
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:01,960
What is it?

558
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,480
Uncle Niu's son has passed away.

559
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,880
Drink slowly.

560
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,000
How did it happen?

561
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,877
He went to the provincial capital
on his own,

562
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,877
but the hospital there
was already overcrowded.

563
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:12,717
He was still fine when he arrived there.

564
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,440
But while waiting, he suddenly collapsed
and never woke up again.

565
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,160
What is the situation in the hospital?

566
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,000
I asked my classmate.

567
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,200
It's a mess.

568
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,317
They lack manpower and protection.

569
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,960
Many doctors have been infected.

570
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,160
Tian Zhen,

571
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,120
Grandpa

572
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,640
has written a prescription

573
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,920
for this illness.

574
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,760
I will forward it to you later.

575
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:42,960
Okay.

576
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,880
This is a small place.

577
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,280
The disease won't spread here for now.

578
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,560
You will stay here.

579
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,600
Where are you going, Dad?

580
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,400
I'm going to the provincial capital.

581
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:11,960
Hello, Kai.

582
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,920
(Please give your order.)

583
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,120
I want to make a call.

584
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,600
Call Luo Yong Xin.

585
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,120
(Calling Luo Yong Xin)

586
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,920
-Hello.
-(Mr Luo.)

587
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,760
(This is Ren Xin Zheng.)

588
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,080
Ren,

589
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,200
we are facing a problem here.

590
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,400
I know.

591
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,520
Mr Luo,

592
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,040
I'm on my way to Wuhan.

593
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,840
How is the situation over there?

594
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,557
(Not good. Don't come here.)

595
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,077
Listen, many of our colleagues

596
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,280
in the surgical department
have been infected.

597
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,880
Internal medicine department?

598
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,560
It's the same.

599
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,277
(Medical supplies are scarce.)

600
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,720
(The higher-ups are already
coordinating support.)

601
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:06,920
(Wuhan)

602
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:11,040
(Jiangzhou People's Hospital)

603
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:41,640
(Tian Zhen)
(Are you okay?)

604
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,240
(Hang in there!)

605
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,480
(All the best to you!)

606
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,120
Is everything okay there?

607
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,280
Everything's fine, right?

608
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,760
By the way, can you help me ask

609
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,000
about

610
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,720
today's treatment plan?

611
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,560
He hasn't been replying my messages.

612
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,717
It's already dark.

613
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,440
Why haven't we started
the acupuncture treatment yet?

614
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,957
Master hasn't replied me yet.

615
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,160
I still don't know
today's treatment plan.

616
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,077
What plan?

617
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,757
Isn't just inserting the needle
to the same spot?

618
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,880
Just do the treatment.

619
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:07,080
You need to stop depending on him.

620
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,160
I'll teach you. Just do it.

621
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,120
That's not a good idea.

622
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:16,960
Child,

623
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,797
my legs may be disabled,

624
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,160
but my brain is not.

625
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:24,120
You should know that your master
and I are fellow disciples.

626
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,240
Okay.

627
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,640
Then let me ask you,

628
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,306
how did you fall?

629
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,597
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

630
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,077
(are referenced from relevant
traditional Chinese medicine books)

631
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,480
(Do not use without medical advice)
