00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,800
(Gen Z)

2
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,920
(Episode 36)

3
00:01:38,289 --> 00:01:39,770
I'm not angry at all.

4
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:43,530
I just feel

5
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:46,009
disappointed.

6
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:49,490
Do you know this? When I...

7
00:01:52,689 --> 00:01:54,010
When I looked at him,

8
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:55,449
(he avoided my eyes.)

9
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:56,609
(At that time, I felt...)

10
00:01:58,529 --> 00:02:00,410
I suddenly felt like

11
00:02:01,129 --> 00:02:03,090
we were strangers.

12
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:10,170
I was utterly disappointed.

13
00:02:18,249 --> 00:02:21,729
I once thought we loved each other.

14
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:25,210
So, it was just my imagination
all along.

15
00:02:28,129 --> 00:02:29,530
I'm a joke.

16
00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:33,129
I'm a huge joke.

17
00:02:37,729 --> 00:02:38,674
My daughter,

18
00:02:39,889 --> 00:02:40,849
actually,

19
00:02:41,809 --> 00:02:43,609
I'm pretty envious of you.

20
00:02:45,289 --> 00:02:46,370
You're envious of me?

21
00:02:47,809 --> 00:02:49,130
I became a laughing stock

22
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:50,050
in front of everyone.

23
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,209
You're saying that
you're envious of me?

24
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,249
Putting everything aside,

25
00:02:54,889 --> 00:02:56,410
you're not young yourself.

26
00:02:57,169 --> 00:02:58,410
However, you're still crying

27
00:02:58,529 --> 00:02:59,650
and laughing

28
00:03:00,809 --> 00:03:02,489
over love and relationships.

29
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:04,929
If your father

30
00:03:05,169 --> 00:03:06,650
were to tell me

31
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,209
that he had
an illegitimate child outside,

32
00:03:08,609 --> 00:03:10,169
I would bring the child back
immediately.

33
00:03:14,809 --> 00:03:15,674
I know.

34
00:03:17,609 --> 00:03:19,770
You don't understand what's going on.

35
00:03:21,809 --> 00:03:22,697
Actually,

36
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:24,849
in this world,

37
00:03:26,169 --> 00:03:28,569
nothing belongs to us,

38
00:03:29,169 --> 00:03:30,289
no matter if it's our children

39
00:03:30,529 --> 00:03:31,690
or our husbands.

40
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:34,889
The only things that truly belong to you

41
00:03:35,609 --> 00:03:37,010
are your feelings

42
00:03:38,169 --> 00:03:39,929
toward life.

43
00:03:43,529 --> 00:03:44,449
In the end,

44
00:03:45,449 --> 00:03:47,210
the only ones who can keep us company
for the rest of our lives

45
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:50,809
are ourselves.

46
00:03:58,169 --> 00:03:59,143
Mum.

47
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:02,529
If we are alone

48
00:04:04,809 --> 00:04:06,809
from the start,

49
00:04:08,089 --> 00:04:10,529
why should I love other people?

50
00:04:10,529 --> 00:04:13,609
Why should I dedicate myself to them?

51
00:04:16,169 --> 00:04:18,729
It's because you have
the ability to love.

52
00:04:22,009 --> 00:04:23,690
Since you have the ability to love,

53
00:04:24,009 --> 00:04:25,570
and possess the energy of love,

54
00:04:26,169 --> 00:04:27,729
you have to project

55
00:04:27,889 --> 00:04:29,290
your love toward others.

56
00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:30,609
Both love and hate

57
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,089
require energy.

58
00:04:33,369 --> 00:04:35,330
Now, I don't feel happiness or sorrow.

59
00:04:38,169 --> 00:04:39,449
It's because

60
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:42,770
I ran out of energy.

61
00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:45,729
That's why I said I'm envious of you.

62
00:04:48,249 --> 00:04:49,169
Mum,

63
00:04:52,009 --> 00:04:54,089
I'm running out of energy too.

64
00:04:54,729 --> 00:04:56,729
You can't let that happen.

65
00:04:59,529 --> 00:05:00,609
You have to love.

66
00:05:27,249 --> 00:05:28,210
What are you doing here?

67
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:37,229
What's the matter?

68
00:05:43,089 --> 00:05:44,169
What's wrong? Speak up.

69
00:05:48,529 --> 00:05:49,729
What happened?

70
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:56,769
I have a father now.

71
00:06:00,209 --> 00:06:02,049
You have a father now? That's great!

72
00:06:06,329 --> 00:06:08,049
Tian Zhen's father is my father.

73
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:06,369
Why are you sighing?

74
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:10,170
Your liver meridians are blocked.

75
00:07:10,809 --> 00:07:12,570
Come, I'll give you
acupuncture treatment.

76
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:13,815
No, thanks.

77
00:07:15,049 --> 00:07:16,730
Our family is falling apart.

78
00:07:17,049 --> 00:07:18,489
I just feel sorry for Tian Zhen.

79
00:07:19,329 --> 00:07:21,329
Now, his father isn't his father

80
00:07:21,329 --> 00:07:23,089
and his girlfriend isn't his girlfriend.

81
00:07:23,329 --> 00:07:25,489
How can they live together
in the future?

82
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:27,369
This is nothing.

83
00:07:27,929 --> 00:07:29,890
How can he achieve success

84
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:32,249
when he can't overcome
a small obstacle like this?

85
00:07:33,049 --> 00:07:35,489
Everything is menial to you.

86
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:39,410
Listen. This is a huge deal
for ordinary people.

87
00:07:39,809 --> 00:07:42,489
Wisdom comes from experience.

88
00:07:43,089 --> 00:07:44,529
Just look at Sima Qian.

89
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:48,209
Here you go again. You only know
about the story of Sima Qian.

90
00:07:48,529 --> 00:07:50,450
You're going to say things like
he was castrated, right?

91
00:07:51,209 --> 00:07:52,649
This world would be much more peaceful

92
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:54,529
if all men were castrated.

93
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,049
Don't say that I talk without restraint.

94
00:07:58,929 --> 00:08:00,089
It's not that women
talk without restraint.

95
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:01,809
It's just that men
act without restraint.

96
00:08:05,489 --> 00:08:07,170
I was referring to Stephen Hawkins.

97
00:08:08,049 --> 00:08:09,809
He could question

98
00:08:10,209 --> 00:08:12,929
the entire universe
just with two fingers.

99
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:18,209
What are you talking about?

100
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:20,240
All is vast and flows round
without stopping,

101
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,480
and extends to the farthest,
and then returns to its origin.

102
00:08:24,049 --> 00:08:27,610
Everything in the world
consists of a cycle.

103
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:31,649
There aren't that many
interesting things in the world.

104
00:08:32,329 --> 00:08:33,890
Let's just take the incident
in our family as an example.

105
00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:35,649
It's already a cliche

106
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:37,170
in most dramas.

107
00:08:37,769 --> 00:08:39,049
Just give them some time.

108
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:42,209
I believe that they'll get over it.

109
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:45,130
Let me ask you something then.

110
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,209
Is Tou Tou truly Xin Zheng's...

111
00:08:49,209 --> 00:08:52,249
Over numerous mountains and streams,
I had doubts that I could find the road.

112
00:08:53,209 --> 00:08:56,329
Then out of the shade of the willows,
came bright flowers and another village.

113
00:08:58,369 --> 00:08:59,410
Why are you

114
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:02,010
always on a different frequency?

115
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,649
I was referring to
a philosophical problem.

116
00:09:07,209 --> 00:09:08,610
Philosophical problem?

117
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:11,170
You're so annoying.

118
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:21,929
You're lying!

119
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:24,170
You lied to us!

120
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:29,057
Tell me the truth.

121
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:32,369
Sun Tou Tou is my daughter.

122
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:34,649
You're lying!

123
00:09:38,929 --> 00:09:40,010
Why should I lie?

124
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:43,170
I just can't understand

125
00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:45,529
why you're trying to lie here!

126
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:52,170
You just have a new younger sister.

127
00:09:52,769 --> 00:09:54,249
Can't you accept that fact?

128
00:09:54,249 --> 00:09:56,089
I don't want a younger sister!

129
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:10,649
Seek virtue and acquire it.

130
00:10:11,009 --> 00:10:11,889
If you seek something,

131
00:10:12,129 --> 00:10:13,329
you'll acquire it.

132
00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:15,449
You robbed me of my future!

133
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:17,329
I have nothing left!

134
00:10:18,649 --> 00:10:20,089
You're still young.

135
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,449
How could you have no future left?

136
00:10:22,449 --> 00:10:23,889
There are many possibilities
to the future.

137
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:25,970
You should go and console your mother.

138
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:28,209
How?

139
00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:31,529
You want me to make her
forgive your mistake?

140
00:10:32,129 --> 00:10:33,250
You want her to forgive
your audacious act

141
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:35,290
and for being sanctimonious?

142
00:10:36,089 --> 00:10:37,329
I can't bear to bring that up.

143
00:10:38,129 --> 00:10:40,850
And, she always needs you,

144
00:10:40,889 --> 00:10:42,009
not me!

145
00:10:43,321 --> 00:10:44,129
But she has forgotten

146
00:10:45,089 --> 00:10:46,569
that you're the most selfless

147
00:10:46,569 --> 00:10:49,569
and selfish person in the family!

148
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,126
(Tian Zhen)

149
00:12:21,193 --> 00:12:23,200
(Tou Tou)

150
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,880
(Tian Zhen)

151
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,955
(Tian Zhen)

152
00:14:32,649 --> 00:14:33,627
It's snowing.

153
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:37,170
Say,

154
00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:40,410
do you desire a father?

155
00:14:41,569 --> 00:14:43,449
Or do you desire a boyfriend?

156
00:14:53,689 --> 00:14:55,889
After studying under Master, I realised

157
00:15:01,449 --> 00:15:03,769
that I could change my fate
with my own hands.

158
00:15:09,769 --> 00:15:10,970
I can change my fate as long as I study

159
00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:14,649
and work hard.

160
00:15:17,129 --> 00:15:18,329
But now, I realised

161
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:24,009
that God has actually made arrangements
for everything.

162
00:15:26,449 --> 00:15:27,730
I was wondering why

163
00:15:27,769 --> 00:15:29,449
a stranger was treating you that nicely.

164
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:33,529
He bailed you out of the police station,

165
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:37,009
(paid for your education fee,)

166
00:15:38,209 --> 00:15:39,370
(and taught you his skills.)

167
00:15:41,529 --> 00:15:43,290
(He treated you
better than anyone else.)

168
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:47,569
So, you're his daughter.

169
00:16:38,889 --> 00:16:40,089
(Sun Tou Tou isn't)

170
00:16:40,089 --> 00:16:41,850
(the successor of the Jiang family's
acupuncture sect.)

171
00:16:42,329 --> 00:16:43,649
(However, no one here)

172
00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:45,569
(is worthy enough to stand here
except for her.)

173
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:50,410
(It's because she's my daughter.)

174
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:55,569
(Say that again?)

175
00:16:57,529 --> 00:16:58,529
(She's my daughter.)

176
00:17:04,529 --> 00:17:05,529
(She's my daughter.)

177
00:17:13,529 --> 00:17:14,393
Where are you going?

178
00:17:15,649 --> 00:17:17,089
Senior Uncle is still in the hospital.

179
00:17:17,689 --> 00:17:19,649
No one is taking care of him.
I have to return to the hospital.

180
00:17:53,449 --> 00:17:54,338
(Master,)

181
00:17:54,689 --> 00:17:55,850
(what's the acupuncture treatment plan)

182
00:17:56,089 --> 00:17:57,449
(for Senior Uncle tomorrow?)

183
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,200
(Maintain the same plan. However,
we need to change the medicine.)

184
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,318
(Okay.)

185
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,758
(I'll send the prescription to
Yang Xiao Hong. She'll take it to you.)

186
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,473
(Okay.)

187
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,264
(Where are you?)

188
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:55,560
(Master, I'm beside Senior Uncle.
I'm taking care of him.)

189
00:19:29,929 --> 00:19:31,370
Our family hasn't fallen apart, right?

190
00:19:32,689 --> 00:19:33,627
If that's the case,

191
00:19:34,569 --> 00:19:35,409
let's start with pulse reading.

192
00:19:39,089 --> 00:19:40,010
Where's Tian Zhen?

193
00:19:40,689 --> 00:19:41,689
Why isn't he joining us?

194
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,158
Granny,

195
00:19:45,209 --> 00:19:46,650
give me a set of keys
for the house on Anfu Road.

196
00:19:47,809 --> 00:19:48,890
Come for pulse reading first

197
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,144
and take your meal.

198
00:19:50,169 --> 00:19:51,289
We can talk after that.

199
00:19:51,689 --> 00:19:53,089
I'm not taking anything. I'm leaving.

200
00:19:53,449 --> 00:19:54,329
Where are you going?

201
00:19:55,169 --> 00:19:56,250
You're not allowed to leave the house.

202
00:19:58,089 --> 00:19:58,890
Tian Zhen,

203
00:19:59,209 --> 00:20:00,610
that house

204
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:02,650
is now the warehouse
for the medical centre.

205
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:03,809
The house is filled with
all kinds of herbs.

206
00:20:04,049 --> 00:20:05,409
There's not even a mattress there.

207
00:20:05,409 --> 00:20:06,209
I'll clean it up myself.

208
00:20:06,569 --> 00:20:07,440
Please stay out of this.

209
00:20:07,929 --> 00:20:08,900
The keys.

210
00:20:28,409 --> 00:20:29,569
There's only one set.

211
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:30,890
Don't lose it.

212
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:33,569
Go and make another set

213
00:20:33,689 --> 00:20:34,650
when you're free.

214
00:20:35,289 --> 00:20:36,315
Got it.

215
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,049
Let's eat.

216
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:51,869
Let's eat.

217
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,720
(Jiangzhou People's Hospital)

218
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:03,929
Do you remember who am I?

219
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:08,010
I don't remember.

220
00:21:14,049 --> 00:21:15,209
Think again.

221
00:21:15,569 --> 00:21:16,650
Do we know each other?

222
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:20,530
Thank you for visiting me.

223
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:25,770
You look great today.

224
00:21:25,929 --> 00:21:27,490
You have to take more food.

225
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:29,809
I don't want to poop on the bed.

226
00:21:30,169 --> 00:21:31,229
You...

227
00:21:31,809 --> 00:21:33,289
Even if you don't want to
poop on the bed,

228
00:21:33,289 --> 00:21:34,809
you still have to eat.

229
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:37,329
You should eat by yourself if you can.

230
00:21:38,169 --> 00:21:39,650
You won't look as handsome
if you lose weight.

231
00:21:44,089 --> 00:21:45,610
Tou Tou will take care of you.

232
00:21:47,289 --> 00:21:48,530
Thank you, angel.

233
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:50,169
Thank you, angel.

234
00:21:50,689 --> 00:21:52,130
She's your angel indeed.

235
00:21:52,289 --> 00:21:53,569
She's been taking care of you
all this while.

236
00:21:56,689 --> 00:21:57,569
Shen Xin?

237
00:22:01,289 --> 00:22:02,289
You still remember her?

238
00:22:03,809 --> 00:22:04,929
She's your wife now.

239
00:22:06,169 --> 00:22:07,370
She's currently at home,

240
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:08,890
taking care of your mother.

241
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:11,929
Your mother has been experiencing
hypertension lately.

242
00:22:12,409 --> 00:22:13,809
Her body is weak.

243
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:16,289
Hypertension.

244
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:20,569
She sends your mother
to the medical centre every day.

245
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:23,130
Ms Dong is taking care of her now.

246
00:22:24,409 --> 00:22:25,689
Thank you, Angel Dong.

247
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:27,530
Thank you, Angel Dong.

248
00:22:30,409 --> 00:22:31,650
Do you truly not recognise me?

249
00:22:34,169 --> 00:22:35,970
You're a living Buddha.

250
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:37,569
A living Buddha.

251
00:22:42,289 --> 00:22:43,209
Li Quan, you're here.

252
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:46,929
Mr Ren, I'm here to visit Mr Wu.

253
00:22:54,169 --> 00:22:55,065
Mr Wu.

254
00:22:56,929 --> 00:22:57,890
Do you still recognise me?

255
00:23:00,209 --> 00:23:01,610
Do you still recognise him?

256
00:23:03,809 --> 00:23:04,689
Hello, angel.

257
00:23:06,089 --> 00:23:07,530
Thank you for visiting me.

258
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:09,049
I'm not an angel.

259
00:23:09,289 --> 00:23:10,329
I'm your student.

260
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:13,850
All those who visit you are angels.

261
00:23:16,409 --> 00:23:18,610
Mr Li is happy

262
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:21,329
that your visitors are
bringing life to the hospital.

263
00:23:23,409 --> 00:23:24,197
Angel,

264
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:26,289
it's been a few days since I pooped.

265
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:29,809
Can you buy some Glycerin Enema for me?

266
00:23:30,089 --> 00:23:31,530
Okay, I'll order it now.

267
00:23:31,809 --> 00:23:32,689
It'll arrive by this afternoon.

268
00:23:33,689 --> 00:23:35,650
I need it now.

269
00:23:37,689 --> 00:23:39,449
Okay then. I'll buy it now.

270
00:23:40,449 --> 00:23:41,449
Thank you, angel.

271
00:23:41,809 --> 00:23:42,890
Thank you, angel.

272
00:23:44,809 --> 00:23:45,736
Angel.

273
00:23:46,409 --> 00:23:47,260
Angel?

274
00:23:49,409 --> 00:23:50,850
I want a foot bath.

275
00:23:53,049 --> 00:23:54,169
I'll go and get the water.

276
00:23:54,169 --> 00:23:55,130
Thank you, angel.

277
00:23:55,569 --> 00:23:56,530
Thank you, angel.

278
00:24:04,689 --> 00:24:05,809
Thank you, angel.

279
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:25,815
Two.

280
00:24:32,049 --> 00:24:32,924
Two.

281
00:24:37,449 --> 00:24:39,569
Two plus two equals?

282
00:24:40,809 --> 00:24:41,689
I know.

283
00:24:41,929 --> 00:24:43,329
What do you know?

284
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:47,409
Do you know who I am?

285
00:24:49,049 --> 00:24:50,530
You're Ren Xin Zheng, my senior.

286
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,809
You were the ex-principal
of the academy.

287
00:24:53,569 --> 00:24:54,689
You scared me.

288
00:24:57,049 --> 00:24:58,010
You're fine?

289
00:24:58,289 --> 00:24:59,169
Yeah.

290
00:25:00,929 --> 00:25:02,809
Why are you pretending then?

291
00:25:05,449 --> 00:25:06,250
Listen.

292
00:25:06,289 --> 00:25:08,289
This is more than just an accident.

293
00:25:12,409 --> 00:25:13,209
Was it Zhao Li Quan?

294
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:14,650
I can't be sure

295
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:15,929
that he pushed me

296
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:17,409
by accident

297
00:25:18,089 --> 00:25:19,209
or on purpose.

298
00:25:24,809 --> 00:25:26,289
You must be terrified, huh?

299
00:25:27,218 --> 00:25:28,267
I'll close the door.

300
00:25:43,689 --> 00:25:44,518
Say,

301
00:25:45,569 --> 00:25:47,169
why did you think Zhao Li Quan

302
00:25:47,929 --> 00:25:48,770
did it?

303
00:25:49,169 --> 00:25:50,409
He wanted me

304
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:52,169
to give him the price list for the
medicine that the hospital would buy

305
00:25:52,569 --> 00:25:54,209
so that he could adjust the price
of the medicine he sells

306
00:25:54,209 --> 00:25:55,730
and compete with the rest.

307
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:56,809
He even tried to bribe me

308
00:25:56,809 --> 00:25:58,169
by giving me a bank card.

309
00:25:59,209 --> 00:26:00,130
However, I didn't agree to it.

310
00:26:03,089 --> 00:26:04,370
This should be

311
00:26:04,409 --> 00:26:05,809
his manager, Mr Tu's idea.

312
00:26:07,409 --> 00:26:09,169
I thought so too initially.

313
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:10,890
But when I was unconscious,

314
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:12,010
he visited me

315
00:26:12,289 --> 00:26:13,169
one night.

316
00:26:14,929 --> 00:26:17,049
He was holding a cloth in his hand.

317
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:37,809
Luckily, he realised his mistake.

318
00:26:38,689 --> 00:26:40,689
He sat beside my bed and cried.

319
00:26:42,929 --> 00:26:44,049
I was heartbroken too.

320
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:21,449
Mr Wu, I'm sorry.

321
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:23,619
I'm sorry.

322
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:42,268
So,

323
00:27:42,929 --> 00:27:44,209
I cannot be sure of it.

324
00:27:45,409 --> 00:27:46,689
However, he should

325
00:27:47,289 --> 00:27:48,569
still have the money with him.

326
00:27:54,929 --> 00:27:56,089
So,

327
00:27:56,530 --> 00:27:58,089
when you were in a coma,

328
00:27:58,449 --> 00:27:59,929
your blood pressure started to rise

329
00:28:00,049 --> 00:28:01,530
whenever he was near you.

330
00:28:02,809 --> 00:28:04,530
All of you guys thought I was in a coma.

331
00:28:04,569 --> 00:28:05,494
You guys were wrong.

332
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:07,289
Actually,

333
00:28:07,689 --> 00:28:09,530
I was conscious.

334
00:28:10,049 --> 00:28:11,530
I just couldn't speak

335
00:28:12,209 --> 00:28:14,209
or protect myself back then.

336
00:28:14,569 --> 00:28:16,010
That's why I was terrified.

337
00:28:22,049 --> 00:28:23,089
What do you plan to do then?

338
00:28:23,809 --> 00:28:25,929
I wish to discuss this matter with you.

339
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:28,209
If we call the cops on him,

340
00:28:28,929 --> 00:28:30,449
his life will be ruined.

341
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:32,169
However, if we don't,

342
00:28:32,929 --> 00:28:34,689
how can we make him realise

343
00:28:34,689 --> 00:28:35,929
his own mistakes?

344
00:28:37,089 --> 00:28:38,490
He's committing a crime here.

345
00:28:38,809 --> 00:28:40,569
He has to return the money.

346
00:28:40,809 --> 00:28:43,929
If not, the consequences will be dire.

347
00:28:46,329 --> 00:28:47,329
He's your student.

348
00:28:48,689 --> 00:28:49,569
You can decide the plan.

349
00:28:50,289 --> 00:28:51,289
I'll just execute it.

350
00:28:52,449 --> 00:28:53,490
I just want to ask you

351
00:28:53,929 --> 00:28:55,689
what you would do

352
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:57,049
if he was your student.

353
00:28:59,089 --> 00:29:00,329
You should hurry up.

354
00:29:00,809 --> 00:29:01,809
He'll return soon.

355
00:29:02,329 --> 00:29:03,289
I already closed the door.

356
00:29:05,689 --> 00:29:06,569
You see,

357
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:09,890
in life,

358
00:29:11,569 --> 00:29:13,650
everyone makes mistakes sometimes.

359
00:29:14,289 --> 00:29:15,409
So,

360
00:29:15,929 --> 00:29:17,089
we need mentors.

361
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:21,049
Heaven, Earth, King, Parent, Teacher.

362
00:29:21,049 --> 00:29:21,970
Teacher

363
00:29:22,449 --> 00:29:25,770
is the base

364
00:29:26,929 --> 00:29:27,890
for the other four figures.

365
00:29:31,449 --> 00:29:33,449
You see, Zhao Li Quan's family

366
00:29:35,049 --> 00:29:36,209
is poor.

367
00:29:36,689 --> 00:29:37,479
He has a huge burden.

368
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:38,494
That's right.

369
00:29:38,569 --> 00:29:40,929
It's not uncommon for him
to have such thoughts.

370
00:29:42,049 --> 00:29:43,890
Luckily, he still has
some conscience left.

371
00:29:44,929 --> 00:29:46,929
He didn't silence you.

372
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:49,089
Therefore, we need to educate

373
00:29:49,089 --> 00:29:50,089
and punish him.

374
00:29:50,929 --> 00:29:53,089
If he was my student,

375
00:29:55,049 --> 00:29:56,650
I should give him an out.

376
00:29:59,929 --> 00:30:01,209
If he can realise

377
00:30:01,209 --> 00:30:02,449
his own mistakes,

378
00:30:03,289 --> 00:30:05,409
I can forgive him.

379
00:30:06,449 --> 00:30:08,169
However, as to whether

380
00:30:08,169 --> 00:30:09,089
God is willing to forgive him or not,

381
00:30:09,569 --> 00:30:10,530
it depends on

382
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:12,010
the level of his self-reflection.

383
00:30:12,329 --> 00:30:13,929
Don't worry. I'll deal with him.

384
00:30:14,929 --> 00:30:16,689
Alright, it's decided then.

385
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:18,049
You can come up with the idea

386
00:30:18,169 --> 00:30:19,080
while I'll deal with the execution.

387
00:30:19,449 --> 00:30:20,650
We'll bear the responsibility together.

388
00:30:20,929 --> 00:30:22,970
We'll split the money too.

389
00:30:24,569 --> 00:30:26,089
However, I need to tell you
something beforehand.

390
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:27,809
No matter

391
00:30:27,809 --> 00:30:29,569
how smooth my recovery process goes,

392
00:30:30,169 --> 00:30:31,169
I no longer remember

393
00:30:32,569 --> 00:30:33,809
what happened in the past.

394
00:30:39,089 --> 00:30:41,890
Are you afraid that
he might try to harm you again?

395
00:30:44,689 --> 00:30:46,809
If he wishes to harm me again,

396
00:30:46,809 --> 00:30:48,610
he'll be done for.

397
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:50,929
I'm not remembering the past

398
00:30:51,929 --> 00:30:55,730
so that we can proceed with our lives
just like usual.

399
00:30:59,169 --> 00:31:00,409
I have to acknowledge you as my teacher.

400
00:31:01,409 --> 00:31:02,890
I never thought

401
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:04,569
that you were this amazing in the past.

402
00:31:07,569 --> 00:31:08,409
I was

403
00:31:08,409 --> 00:31:09,569
worried

404
00:31:09,809 --> 00:31:11,449
that you might turn into an idiot
after the incident.

405
00:31:12,089 --> 00:31:13,370
Now,

406
00:31:13,569 --> 00:31:14,929
not only have you not
turned into an idiot,

407
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:17,809
but you're also much smarter.

408
00:31:18,089 --> 00:31:19,049
Do I look like

409
00:31:19,209 --> 00:31:21,169
I'm an idiot?

410
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:24,890
Next,

411
00:31:25,215 --> 00:31:26,095
just treat me

412
00:31:26,329 --> 00:31:28,089
until I can walk properly.

413
00:31:29,049 --> 00:31:30,610
I don't want anyone to serve me,

414
00:31:31,049 --> 00:31:32,169
especially the girl.

415
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:33,929
I don't understand at all.

416
00:31:34,169 --> 00:31:35,209
Why didn't you hire

417
00:31:35,209 --> 00:31:37,209
a male caretaker for me before this?

418
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:40,775
Wu Shan Dao,

419
00:31:41,409 --> 00:31:42,770
you should be grateful to her.

420
00:31:43,049 --> 00:31:45,289
No one could say for sure

421
00:31:45,689 --> 00:31:47,089
if you could survive until now

422
00:31:47,089 --> 00:31:50,049
if Sun Tou Tou wasn't
taking care of you.

423
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:51,730
Let me tell you something.

424
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:53,569
I told everyone

425
00:31:53,569 --> 00:31:55,449
that Sun Tou Tou was my daughter.

426
00:31:56,929 --> 00:31:58,169
I know that.

427
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:00,900
But,

428
00:32:01,089 --> 00:32:02,689
what about Ling Lan's feelings?

429
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:12,770
I always suspected

430
00:32:12,929 --> 00:32:14,569
that you had feelings for my wife.

431
00:32:14,809 --> 00:32:16,730
I think my suspicion might be correct.

432
00:32:19,809 --> 00:32:22,010
Am I right?

433
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:30,409
Fine.

434
00:32:30,809 --> 00:32:31,809
Be gentle!

435
00:32:31,809 --> 00:32:33,409
-Am I right?
-Be gentle!

436
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:34,610
Master, open the door.

437
00:32:36,169 --> 00:32:38,449
Angel, I'm starving.

438
00:32:38,449 --> 00:32:40,130
Give me food.

439
00:32:40,169 --> 00:32:41,010
I'll spare you this time.

440
00:32:41,409 --> 00:32:42,315
Okay.

441
00:32:43,569 --> 00:32:44,850
Give me food.

442
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:46,329
I'm starving.

443
00:32:46,467 --> 00:32:48,520
(Jiangzhou People's Hospital)

444
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,433
(Winter Solstice has
the least amount of sunlight)

445
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:57,531
(and its daytime is the shortest.)

446
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:03,291
(In the North, people have the habit
of taking dumplings during this day.)

447
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:08,218
(To them, Winter Solstice is just as
important as Chinese New Year.)

448
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:15,462
(Winter Solstice)

449
00:33:30,676 --> 00:33:31,650
Granny,

450
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:32,650
pack some dumplings

451
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:33,530
and Winter Solstice soup for me.

452
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:34,400
I'll be bringing them with me.

453
00:33:35,569 --> 00:33:37,289
You're leaving already?

454
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:39,289
Did you clean up the place?

455
00:33:39,409 --> 00:33:40,400
Yes.

456
00:33:41,169 --> 00:33:42,049
It's Winter Solstice.

457
00:33:42,169 --> 00:33:43,370
Aren't you joining us for dinner?

458
00:33:44,289 --> 00:33:45,268
Nope.

459
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:49,089
You're delivering food to Tou Tou?

460
00:33:50,569 --> 00:33:52,089
I don't want her to be alone

461
00:33:52,089 --> 00:33:53,049
and live on the breadline.

462
00:34:24,169 --> 00:34:25,530
You should have some before leaving.

463
00:34:43,911 --> 00:34:44,908
Granny,

464
00:34:49,244 --> 00:34:50,103
Grandpa,

465
00:34:53,809 --> 00:34:54,690
I'll be leaving now.

466
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:32,872
(Jiangzhou People's Hospital)

467
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:35,650
These are fresh clothes for her.

468
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:36,689
It also contains brushes,
ink, papers, and inkstones.

469
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:38,049
Leave them here.

470
00:35:38,409 --> 00:35:39,650
She can write when she's free.

471
00:35:39,809 --> 00:35:40,775
There's also a pair of
cotton-padded shoes.

472
00:35:41,169 --> 00:35:42,490
Remind her to wear it.

473
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:45,129
Are you sure
you don't want to visit her?

474
00:35:45,689 --> 00:35:46,674
Maybe next time.

475
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:55,369
I don't have the courage to see her now.

476
00:35:56,810 --> 00:35:57,770
I don't think

477
00:35:59,369 --> 00:36:00,649
she'll be happy to see me now.

478
00:36:06,369 --> 00:36:07,649
You two are something else.

479
00:36:11,609 --> 00:36:12,486
Alright.

480
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:13,849
The food won't be as good
if it gets cold.

481
00:36:13,849 --> 00:36:15,010
You should deliver it to her.

482
00:36:15,449 --> 00:36:16,322
I'll make a move first.

483
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:39,609
You're finally here.

484
00:36:41,369 --> 00:36:42,315
Eat it while it's hot.

485
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:47,072
Did he deliver it here?

486
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:04,889
I wonder if he

487
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:07,649
has taken the Winter Solstice soup.

488
00:37:14,889 --> 00:37:15,970
It tastes just like Granny's cooking.

489
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:30,649
(I still had something
I didn't tell you.)

490
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:32,609
(You're not alone.)

491
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:34,065
(Your family,)

492
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:35,494
(your loved ones,)

493
00:37:35,929 --> 00:37:37,449
I'll make it up to you eventually.

494
00:37:47,602 --> 00:37:49,803
(I spent the good merit
I gathered since 20 years ago)

495
00:37:50,209 --> 00:37:52,209
(on our relationship.)

496
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:53,479
You're still mine.

497
00:38:02,689 --> 00:38:03,570
What did you tell him?

498
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:06,169
I said you were the only one
in my heart.

499
00:38:06,169 --> 00:38:07,449
I have no space for anyone else.

500
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:09,849
It's Winter Solstice.

501
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:11,770
It's not like it's my funeral.

502
00:39:12,369 --> 00:39:13,609
Why are you pulling a long face?

503
00:39:17,849 --> 00:39:19,290
Even the dumplings
don't taste as good now.

504
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:30,369
Hey, say something.

505
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:37,609
When eating, do not converse.
When in bed, do not speak.

506
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:39,221
Just eat.

507
00:40:35,369 --> 00:40:36,250
Leave the window open.

508
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:39,354
Mr Ren,

509
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:40,912
were you looking for me?

510
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:53,510
Have a seat.

511
00:40:57,409 --> 00:40:58,252
Let's have some tea.

512
00:41:00,129 --> 00:41:01,090
You can brew the tea today.

513
00:41:02,409 --> 00:41:03,530
Mr Ren, I don't know how to brew tea.

514
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:06,050
You can learn.

515
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:10,900
Okay.

516
00:41:58,889 --> 00:41:59,744
Mr Ren,

517
00:42:01,409 --> 00:42:02,849
why did you call me here today?

518
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:05,877
For no particular reason.

519
00:42:09,689 --> 00:42:10,518
The tea is ready.

520
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:11,900
Please.

521
00:42:34,889 --> 00:42:35,810
Try it and tell me how you feel.

522
00:42:43,129 --> 00:42:44,050
I'm not well-versed in this field.

523
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:45,129
I cannot tell if it's good or bad.

524
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:50,330
It doesn't matter if you can't tell
whether the tea is good or bad.

525
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:56,409
However, you need to be able to
differentiate between right and wrong.

526
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,711
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

527
00:43:02,822 --> 00:43:04,122
(are referenced from relevant
traditional Chinese medicine books)
