1
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,787
(Gen Z)

2
00:01:35,621 --> 00:01:37,392
(Episode 19)

3
00:01:39,625 --> 00:01:42,545
That's why
you couldn't be the inheritor.

4
00:01:42,986 --> 00:01:43,986
I need to do it.

5
00:01:44,265 --> 00:01:45,506
I need to do this kind of thing.

6
00:01:46,225 --> 00:01:47,786
You've gotten too deep into this.

7
00:01:47,786 --> 00:01:49,265
Oh, right. I suddenly remembered this.

8
00:01:50,105 --> 00:01:53,186
You said you wanted
to bungee jump at Feilong Canyon, right?

9
00:01:54,065 --> 00:01:55,826
I heard it's closed now.

10
00:01:56,026 --> 00:01:57,266
You can't go there.
Change to another place.

11
00:01:57,266 --> 00:01:57,666
No.

12
00:01:58,305 --> 00:02:00,145
This is the reason I want to go there.

13
00:02:04,906 --> 00:02:06,305
Ren Tian Zhen, are you crazy?

14
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:09,585
It's New Year now.
Don't make me scold you.

15
00:02:10,145 --> 00:02:11,506
You don't understand
the realm of masters.

16
00:02:11,866 --> 00:02:13,265
I'm going to beat you to death!

17
00:02:13,265 --> 00:02:13,905
What are you doing?

18
00:02:14,026 --> 00:02:14,986
What am I doing?

19
00:02:15,226 --> 00:02:16,866
Human should cherish their lives.

20
00:02:17,785 --> 00:02:19,585
Don't say such nonsense again.

21
00:02:20,026 --> 00:02:20,945
Cherish your life.

22
00:02:20,945 --> 00:02:22,905
Your life not only belongs to you alone.

23
00:02:22,905 --> 00:02:24,186
It belongs to the one you love too.

24
00:02:24,346 --> 00:02:25,346
You're like Jian Xi.

25
00:02:25,465 --> 00:02:27,145
Her life not only belongs to her.

26
00:02:27,145 --> 00:02:29,305
It belongs to her mother and Cheng Ying.

27
00:02:33,105 --> 00:02:35,346
What do you know? You brat know nothing!

28
00:02:38,866 --> 00:02:39,945
You've changed!

29
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,560
Previously, you ran a red light
and went the opposite way on a scooter.

30
00:02:43,986 --> 00:02:45,585
Why have you become like
a director of teaching and learning now?

31
00:02:47,185 --> 00:02:49,426
Tell me about it. What happened?
What's the matter?

32
00:02:53,225 --> 00:02:53,746
Alright.

33
00:02:54,185 --> 00:02:55,625
Let me see how long you can hold back.

34
00:03:02,505 --> 00:03:03,505
Such a big gourd.

35
00:03:04,146 --> 00:03:04,905
And pumpkin.

36
00:03:24,225 --> 00:03:24,986
Hello, Tou Tou.

37
00:03:25,986 --> 00:03:27,426
That's right. You go to the exit first.

38
00:03:27,545 --> 00:03:28,666
I'll drive the car over.

39
00:03:29,066 --> 00:03:31,026
We have to hurry up. They're waiting
for us at home to make dumplings.

40
00:03:32,026 --> 00:03:32,505
Okay.

41
00:03:49,986 --> 00:03:51,105
Brother!

42
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:52,545
Hello! Hi, Mdm. Wang.

43
00:03:53,706 --> 00:03:54,786
Li Quan, you're back.

44
00:03:55,545 --> 00:03:56,306
Granny.

45
00:03:57,465 --> 00:03:57,946
Li Quan, you're back.

46
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:58,706
Li Quan.

47
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:00,385
-Li Quan.
-Ms. Liu.

48
00:04:00,385 --> 00:04:01,146
You're back.

49
00:04:04,105 --> 00:04:04,946
Granny Kang!

50
00:04:05,185 --> 00:04:06,706
I wish you have a long life.

51
00:04:06,706 --> 00:04:08,105
Happy New Year!

52
00:04:24,385 --> 00:04:25,625
Happy New Year, mister.

53
00:04:29,265 --> 00:04:30,986
Li Quan, you're back!

54
00:04:31,586 --> 00:04:32,226
Mdm. Zhang.

55
00:04:32,226 --> 00:04:33,346
You came back for New Year.

56
00:04:33,706 --> 00:04:34,506
Yes, I'm back.

57
00:04:34,706 --> 00:04:35,825
Has Zhang come back?

58
00:04:36,506 --> 00:04:37,066
He is?

59
00:04:37,066 --> 00:04:38,025
He's back.

60
00:04:38,385 --> 00:04:39,465
Li Quan, you're back.

61
00:04:51,185 --> 00:04:53,625
Dad, Mom, Brother is back.

62
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:54,185
Mom!

63
00:04:54,426 --> 00:04:56,226
Quan! You're back!

64
00:04:56,426 --> 00:04:56,866
Mom!

65
00:04:57,866 --> 00:04:58,545
You're finally home.

66
00:04:58,545 --> 00:05:00,586
Brother, what delicious food
did you bring for me?

67
00:05:00,905 --> 00:05:01,786
They are all there.

68
00:05:03,346 --> 00:05:04,625
You only know how to eat.

69
00:05:07,665 --> 00:05:08,665
Come, try it.

70
00:05:09,066 --> 00:05:10,866
Dad, Quan is home!

71
00:05:10,866 --> 00:05:12,426
Mom, try it.

72
00:05:12,426 --> 00:05:13,146
What is this?

73
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:13,706
Something tasty.

74
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:16,625
Brother.

75
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,786
This is a molten sesame ball!

76
00:05:19,866 --> 00:05:21,625
My classmates will envy me.

77
00:05:22,066 --> 00:05:24,226
My brother brought me these
from the big city.

78
00:05:25,306 --> 00:05:26,905
And some toys too. Here you go.

79
00:05:27,265 --> 00:05:27,825
Thank you, Brother.

80
00:05:28,265 --> 00:05:30,385
You're not young anymore.
Why are you still playing with toys?

81
00:05:30,465 --> 00:05:31,185
Li Quan!

82
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:32,426
Eat your snack.

83
00:05:32,545 --> 00:05:33,706
-You're back.
-Dad!

84
00:05:34,146 --> 00:05:34,905
What's wrong with your leg?

85
00:05:35,506 --> 00:05:36,866
I don't know either.
I couldn't describe it.

86
00:05:36,866 --> 00:05:37,706
I just feel pain.

87
00:05:37,706 --> 00:05:38,385
Come.

88
00:05:38,745 --> 00:05:40,986
He's so painful that
he couldn't sleep these days.

89
00:05:41,306 --> 00:05:42,465
Check his leg.

90
00:05:42,465 --> 00:05:43,146
Take a seat.

91
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:50,506
This side?

92
00:05:50,506 --> 00:05:51,065
Yes.

93
00:05:55,785 --> 00:05:56,146
Be gentle.

94
00:05:56,146 --> 00:05:57,146
You have a bruise, Dad.

95
00:05:57,426 --> 00:05:58,225
Did you seethe?

96
00:05:58,665 --> 00:05:59,426
Rheumatism.

97
00:05:59,866 --> 00:06:01,385
It happened
after he worked in the fields.

98
00:06:02,785 --> 00:06:04,466
He works in the fields.

99
00:06:04,466 --> 00:06:05,505
You work in the fields too.

100
00:06:05,785 --> 00:06:06,626
Why didn't you have rheumatism?

101
00:06:07,186 --> 00:06:08,105
Who knows?

102
00:06:10,026 --> 00:06:10,505
Dad.

103
00:06:11,186 --> 00:06:12,706
It's okay, relax.

104
00:06:13,785 --> 00:06:14,665
Don't keep getting angry.

105
00:06:15,265 --> 00:06:16,706
I'll treat you with acupuncture
these few days

106
00:06:17,105 --> 00:06:18,505
and massage for you.
You'll be recovered.

107
00:06:19,746 --> 00:06:21,385
How can I be relaxed?

108
00:06:21,706 --> 00:06:23,986
Whenever something bad happens
to your mom, she will scold me.

109
00:06:24,265 --> 00:06:26,105
She is relaxed,
but I keep all the anger.

110
00:06:26,466 --> 00:06:27,665
Why did she scold you?

111
00:06:27,945 --> 00:06:28,906
About your brother.

112
00:06:29,306 --> 00:06:30,706
I told him several times.

113
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:32,505
I don't want him to study anymore.

114
00:06:33,225 --> 00:06:33,866
But he won't listen.

115
00:06:34,385 --> 00:06:36,146
He said he wants to learn from you.

116
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:37,385
He wants to study in the city.

117
00:06:37,385 --> 00:06:38,626
He wants to be a city resident.

118
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,345
Dad, listen to me.

119
00:06:41,426 --> 00:06:43,706
It doesn't matter
if one becomes a city resident.

120
00:06:44,146 --> 00:06:45,026
But he must study.

121
00:06:46,065 --> 00:06:46,626
Son.

122
00:06:47,065 --> 00:06:48,466
Our family can't afford it.

123
00:06:48,706 --> 00:06:51,225
Moreover, you two will live in the city.

124
00:06:51,426 --> 00:06:52,626
We're getting older.

125
00:06:52,906 --> 00:06:55,545
Tell me. Who will run the household?

126
00:06:55,866 --> 00:06:56,426
That's right.

127
00:06:56,785 --> 00:06:58,586
We'll be bullied when no one is at home.

128
00:06:58,945 --> 00:07:00,345
Just like our fish pond.

129
00:07:00,505 --> 00:07:02,105
Many people are eyeing it.

130
00:07:05,385 --> 00:07:05,906
Dad.

131
00:07:06,746 --> 00:07:08,466
How about we use the toys

132
00:07:08,746 --> 00:07:09,466
Quan bought

133
00:07:10,026 --> 00:07:11,746
and give them to
the village head's grandson

134
00:07:12,385 --> 00:07:13,385
to flatter him?

135
00:07:14,505 --> 00:07:15,986
We still have to work
for another ten years.

136
00:07:15,986 --> 00:07:18,746
After ten years,
your brother will graduate.

137
00:07:21,026 --> 00:07:21,586
Right.

138
00:07:22,746 --> 00:07:23,345
Dad, Mom.

139
00:07:24,186 --> 00:07:25,906
I don't have much savings for this year.

140
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:29,265
I've prepared red packets for you two.

141
00:07:29,706 --> 00:07:30,505
Happy New Year, Dad.

142
00:07:31,186 --> 00:07:32,225
Happy New Year, Mom.

143
00:07:36,866 --> 00:07:37,785
Only this much?

144
00:07:38,345 --> 00:07:39,545
Being a doctor doesn't make money?

145
00:07:40,545 --> 00:07:41,986
Well, I just started.

146
00:07:43,146 --> 00:07:44,505
And it's TCM practitioner.

147
00:07:45,426 --> 00:07:45,945
Well,

148
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:47,385
in order to send you to school,

149
00:07:47,626 --> 00:07:49,225
we borrowed a lot of money.

150
00:07:49,505 --> 00:07:50,906
This is not enough to pay them back.

151
00:07:51,545 --> 00:07:52,626
What are you talking about?

152
00:07:52,746 --> 00:07:54,906
This is his thoughts.

153
00:07:55,186 --> 00:07:56,665
He just got started.

154
00:07:56,945 --> 00:07:58,746
Next year. It'll be good next year.

155
00:07:59,466 --> 00:08:01,105
Quan, don't listen to your dad.

156
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:02,385
He doesn't know how to say good words.

157
00:08:02,385 --> 00:08:04,265
In fact, he looked forward
to your return the most.

158
00:08:04,586 --> 00:08:07,466
You know, he went
to the market two days ago.

159
00:08:07,825 --> 00:08:08,345
Look.

160
00:08:08,945 --> 00:08:11,146
He bought the new cotton quilt.

161
00:08:11,385 --> 00:08:12,426
It's so soft!

162
00:08:15,626 --> 00:08:18,505
Quan, do you have any new clothes?

163
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:19,225
Change into it.

164
00:08:20,545 --> 00:08:22,026
Why? These are good.

165
00:08:22,225 --> 00:08:23,626
You don't look like a city resident.

166
00:08:23,785 --> 00:08:25,026
Go to the village head's house with me.

167
00:08:25,545 --> 00:08:26,026
That's right.

168
00:08:26,345 --> 00:08:27,545
Why are we going
to the village head's house?

169
00:08:27,545 --> 00:08:28,385
For a blind date!

170
00:08:29,825 --> 00:08:31,306
The village head's niece,

171
00:08:31,665 --> 00:08:34,665
your classmate, Wang Ying Hua,

172
00:08:34,665 --> 00:08:35,306
do you still remember her?

173
00:08:36,906 --> 00:08:38,385
If you two get married,

174
00:08:38,426 --> 00:08:39,505
our family will become great.

175
00:08:39,505 --> 00:08:40,906
We'll become powerful

176
00:08:40,906 --> 00:08:42,785
and don't have
to look at their long faces.

177
00:08:43,146 --> 00:08:44,065
Mom, I don't want to go.

178
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:44,866
Go take a look.

179
00:08:44,866 --> 00:08:45,665
Son.

180
00:08:45,665 --> 00:08:48,065
Wang Ying Hua's father
is the current deputy county mayor.

181
00:08:48,306 --> 00:08:49,545
It's such a good fate.

182
00:08:49,545 --> 00:08:50,345
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

183
00:08:50,345 --> 00:08:51,545
Let's go together.

184
00:08:51,545 --> 00:08:52,785
The daughter of
the deputy county mayor

185
00:08:52,785 --> 00:08:53,945
is out of my league!

186
00:08:53,945 --> 00:08:55,265
Who says that?

187
00:08:55,265 --> 00:08:56,505
You're now a city resident!

188
00:08:56,586 --> 00:08:58,986
You're educated
and work in a big hospital.

189
00:08:58,986 --> 00:09:01,146
And your mentor is the principal, right?

190
00:09:01,146 --> 00:09:02,146
I've told them that

191
00:09:02,146 --> 00:09:03,825
in the future,
you're the director of the hospital!

192
00:09:03,825 --> 00:09:05,186
-That's right.
-You're out of her league!

193
00:09:05,186 --> 00:09:06,545
Dad, don't talk nonsense!

194
00:09:06,545 --> 00:09:08,505
-What nonsense?
-Other people have heard you!

195
00:09:08,505 --> 00:09:10,026
What are you afraid of?
I didn't talk nonsense!

196
00:09:10,026 --> 00:09:12,306
-Let's go!
-Dad, I'm not going! Dad!

197
00:09:12,306 --> 00:09:14,146
-Let's go!
-I don't want to go on a blind date.

198
00:09:14,146 --> 00:09:14,626
Let's go!

199
00:09:16,385 --> 00:09:17,265
Li Xin!

200
00:09:17,385 --> 00:09:18,545
Pull me!

201
00:09:19,746 --> 00:09:20,866
Let's go, son.

202
00:09:21,306 --> 00:09:22,426
It's such a wonderful thing.

203
00:09:22,426 --> 00:09:24,026
Dad, I'm not going!

204
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:36,367
("Li" means the beginning)

205
00:09:37,289 --> 00:09:39,662
("Chun" means warmth, fine Spring days)

206
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:43,400
(Ploughing and sowing in Spring
make the plants stronger)

207
00:09:44,075 --> 00:09:47,513
(The period between solar terms
of Lichun to Lixia is known as "Spring")

208
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,960
(Lichun, the beginning of spring)

209
00:09:58,665 --> 00:10:00,105
Great!

210
00:10:16,266 --> 00:10:17,025
Grandpa.

211
00:10:17,465 --> 00:10:18,946
I think there's too much dough.

212
00:10:19,426 --> 00:10:20,266
We only have these fillings.

213
00:10:20,506 --> 00:10:21,585
It's alright.

214
00:10:22,105 --> 00:10:23,506
I'll cook

215
00:10:24,025 --> 00:10:25,266
dough-ball soup with it.

216
00:10:25,585 --> 00:10:27,905
I'll add some Chinese white cabbage,
tomato, and others

217
00:10:27,905 --> 00:10:29,345
and cook it in a pot.
It's going to be delicious.

218
00:10:29,345 --> 00:10:30,145
It's okay if there's a lot.

219
00:10:30,826 --> 00:10:32,866
You could sound plausible
when it comes to food.

220
00:10:33,545 --> 00:10:34,585
You talk the talk.

221
00:10:34,705 --> 00:10:35,946
This saying is good.

222
00:10:36,266 --> 00:10:37,626
"Losing one's integrity
is a small matter,

223
00:10:37,626 --> 00:10:38,545
but starving to death is a big one."

224
00:10:38,545 --> 00:10:39,266
Am I right, Grandpa?

225
00:10:39,626 --> 00:10:40,545
Am I right, Grandma?

226
00:10:50,306 --> 00:10:51,905
With Tou Tou here this year,

227
00:10:52,306 --> 00:10:53,986
our New Year is more exciting.

228
00:10:54,585 --> 00:10:55,426
Look at Mom and Dad.

229
00:10:56,105 --> 00:10:56,826
They're so happy.

230
00:10:59,386 --> 00:11:02,066
I think this is the first time

231
00:11:02,545 --> 00:11:04,306
Tou Tou celebrates New Year
with the family.

232
00:11:04,306 --> 00:11:05,545
Write couplets...

233
00:11:06,145 --> 00:11:07,465
Put up New Year paintings...

234
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,119
Discard old stuff and buy new ones...

235
00:11:09,145 --> 00:11:09,905
Prepare dumplings...

236
00:11:09,905 --> 00:11:10,986
Watch TV...

237
00:11:11,426 --> 00:11:12,585
She's curious about everything.

238
00:11:12,785 --> 00:11:13,705
Actually,

239
00:11:14,905 --> 00:11:16,186
we do all these

240
00:11:16,186 --> 00:11:18,426
just for the children.

241
00:11:18,826 --> 00:11:19,306
You're right.

242
00:11:22,705 --> 00:11:23,585
Look, I'm doing it in one breath.

243
00:11:24,946 --> 00:11:25,946
I'm sorry.

244
00:11:26,145 --> 00:11:27,066
Be careful.

245
00:11:31,705 --> 00:11:32,186
Again.

246
00:11:32,506 --> 00:11:33,626
Alright. Tie it up.

247
00:11:34,105 --> 00:11:35,426
Done.

248
00:11:37,545 --> 00:11:38,465
You've scared me!

249
00:11:40,986 --> 00:11:41,626
What's wrong?

250
00:11:42,986 --> 00:11:43,665
No,

251
00:11:44,145 --> 00:11:44,785
You'll hurt your eyes!

252
00:11:44,785 --> 00:11:45,545
You naughty girl!

253
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:48,145
If we can't play
the firecrackers during New Year,

254
00:11:48,145 --> 00:11:49,626
we should pop the balloons.

255
00:11:50,545 --> 00:11:51,905
They're popping the balloons.

256
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:52,986
My god.

257
00:11:54,306 --> 00:11:55,266
You're right.

258
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:56,506
It's so much more fun

259
00:11:56,746 --> 00:11:58,866
with her in our home.

260
00:11:59,225 --> 00:12:00,105
Her movement

261
00:12:00,785 --> 00:12:02,025
is getting bigger now.

262
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:03,946
But

263
00:12:05,186 --> 00:12:06,306
my little heart

264
00:12:06,785 --> 00:12:08,145
can't stand it.

265
00:12:08,946 --> 00:12:09,506
Hurry up.

266
00:12:09,705 --> 00:12:10,946
My little heart is fine.

267
00:12:11,826 --> 00:12:13,025
The dumplings are ready!

268
00:12:13,025 --> 00:12:14,386
Let's eat dumplings!

269
00:12:16,386 --> 00:12:17,545
Dumplings with two types of fillings.

270
00:12:24,545 --> 00:12:25,306
This is fun!

271
00:12:28,066 --> 00:12:28,545
Enough.

272
00:12:41,746 --> 00:12:42,386
Quan.

273
00:12:43,066 --> 00:12:44,345
Is it cold?

274
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,066
It's not cold, Mom.

275
00:12:46,386 --> 00:12:47,826
I've prepared a hot water bag for you

276
00:12:47,826 --> 00:12:49,145
to put in the quilt.

277
00:12:50,506 --> 00:12:51,186
Thank you, Mom.

278
00:12:54,545 --> 00:12:56,785
Have you tried on the suit
for the blind date?

279
00:12:57,665 --> 00:13:00,506
Your dad spent
a lot of his money for it.

280
00:13:01,905 --> 00:13:03,105
Try it and see if it's suitable.

281
00:13:03,426 --> 00:13:04,826
Later, I'll iron it.

282
00:13:05,306 --> 00:13:05,826
Mom.

283
00:13:06,826 --> 00:13:07,826
I don't want to go on a blind date.

284
00:13:09,585 --> 00:13:10,186
Why?

285
00:13:10,905 --> 00:13:12,665
You don't like Wang Ying Hua?

286
00:13:14,306 --> 00:13:15,626
Just meet her first.

287
00:13:16,266 --> 00:13:18,105
Feelings can be cultivated.

288
00:13:26,145 --> 00:13:26,866
Quan.

289
00:13:27,465 --> 00:13:28,866
Tell me honestly.

290
00:13:29,626 --> 00:13:30,585
Do you

291
00:13:31,025 --> 00:13:32,545
have a girl you like?

292
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:50,626
No, Mom.

293
00:13:52,426 --> 00:13:53,626
Who would like

294
00:13:54,386 --> 00:13:55,545
people like me?

295
00:13:57,826 --> 00:13:58,506
What's wrong?

296
00:13:58,746 --> 00:14:00,506
What's wrong with you?

297
00:14:00,905 --> 00:14:01,866
You'll become

298
00:14:01,866 --> 00:14:04,905
a hospital director in a big city.

299
00:14:05,225 --> 00:14:06,905
Mom, you said that again.

300
00:14:07,905 --> 00:14:10,345
Dad and you keep saying this
since I came back.

301
00:14:10,946 --> 00:14:13,105
People will laugh at us
if they hear this.

302
00:14:13,105 --> 00:14:14,386
Why should they laugh at us?

303
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:15,506
This is bound to happen.

304
00:14:15,665 --> 00:14:16,826
Bound to happen?

305
00:14:16,826 --> 00:14:18,145
It's not going to happen.

306
00:14:20,386 --> 00:14:22,225
Do you really have someone you like?

307
00:14:22,746 --> 00:14:23,626
Where is her hometown?

308
00:14:23,626 --> 00:14:24,465
How old is she?

309
00:14:24,545 --> 00:14:25,465
Is she pretty?

310
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:26,025
Mom.

311
00:14:26,506 --> 00:14:27,585
If I really have someone I like,

312
00:14:27,585 --> 00:14:29,225
I'll bring her back to meet you, okay?

313
00:14:31,225 --> 00:14:32,225
You must have someone already.

314
00:15:25,986 --> 00:15:26,986
Be gentle.

315
00:15:55,186 --> 00:15:56,386
You're still awake?

316
00:16:00,345 --> 00:16:00,905
I...

317
00:16:29,826 --> 00:16:30,665
I hate you!

318
00:17:37,105 --> 00:17:37,905
Tou Tou.

319
00:17:38,826 --> 00:17:40,585
I think the new clothes are nice.

320
00:17:41,506 --> 00:17:44,306
New clothes for New Year.

321
00:17:44,826 --> 00:17:45,946
I know.

322
00:17:46,746 --> 00:17:48,225
I can understand the red color.

323
00:17:49,545 --> 00:17:52,025
I can understand about
it being a sweater as well.

324
00:17:52,665 --> 00:17:53,386
The thing is...

325
00:17:54,585 --> 00:17:56,465
The thing is, what do the flowers mean?

326
00:17:57,665 --> 00:17:58,633
These big flowers alone

327
00:17:58,659 --> 00:17:59,712
made me feel like

328
00:17:59,737 --> 00:18:01,665
I'm not having a good New Year.

329
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,241
The flowers are beautiful.

330
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:05,105
That's not it.

331
00:18:06,225 --> 00:18:07,665
These flowers indicate that

332
00:18:08,145 --> 00:18:09,025
you'll make

333
00:18:09,746 --> 00:18:11,225
great progress in the new year.

334
00:18:11,225 --> 00:18:12,306
You'll have greater joy.

335
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:13,585
Mr. Ren.

336
00:18:14,105 --> 00:18:16,585
I actually think
my black clothes are nice.

337
00:18:16,585 --> 00:18:17,506
Whatever colors the clothes are...

338
00:18:17,506 --> 00:18:18,545
Red looks good.

339
00:18:18,986 --> 00:18:21,066
No one wears black clothes
on the first day of New Year.

340
00:18:21,545 --> 00:18:22,705
The joy of red.

341
00:18:23,105 --> 00:18:24,426
Flourishing and prosperous.

342
00:18:24,665 --> 00:18:26,225
-Come here, quick.
-Go.

343
00:18:26,225 --> 00:18:27,465
We're giving out the red packets.

344
00:18:29,986 --> 00:18:30,665
What?

345
00:18:31,105 --> 00:18:31,826
Why...

346
00:18:32,306 --> 00:18:33,905
I'm an adult now.

347
00:18:33,905 --> 00:18:35,665
I can still get the red packets?

348
00:18:35,665 --> 00:18:37,665
If you are not married
and haven't got kids yet,

349
00:18:37,665 --> 00:18:39,386
you'll always be our child.

350
00:18:39,386 --> 00:18:41,866
When you get married and have children,

351
00:18:41,866 --> 00:18:43,666
you're qualified to be an adult.

352
00:18:44,185 --> 00:18:45,105
Look.

353
00:18:45,105 --> 00:18:46,666
How boring it is if we can't

354
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:47,705
give out the red packets
during New Year.

355
00:18:47,705 --> 00:18:50,065
Tian Zhen, bring the cushion over.

356
00:18:50,746 --> 00:18:52,945
I'm finally not alone this year.

357
00:18:52,945 --> 00:18:54,906
I've been kowtowing alone every year.

358
00:18:55,105 --> 00:18:55,585
Kowtow?

359
00:18:57,146 --> 00:18:57,506
Come.

360
00:18:57,626 --> 00:18:58,305
Come, Tou Tou.

361
00:19:08,705 --> 00:19:09,866
Lightly.

362
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:12,746
Just say a few auspicious words.

363
00:19:14,546 --> 00:19:15,345
Wait a minute.

364
00:19:17,185 --> 00:19:17,825
What's wrong?

365
00:19:18,065 --> 00:19:18,585
Come quickly!

366
00:19:19,105 --> 00:19:19,786
Come quickly.

367
00:19:19,786 --> 00:19:20,506
What are you doing?

368
00:19:20,506 --> 00:19:21,506
Come. Hurry up.

369
00:19:21,506 --> 00:19:22,866
Come, come.

370
00:19:22,866 --> 00:19:24,465
Stand here. Stand properly.

371
00:19:24,465 --> 00:19:25,105
Stand here.

372
00:19:25,626 --> 00:19:26,465
Stand still.

373
00:19:31,026 --> 00:19:33,705
I wish Mr. Song and Mrs. Song,

374
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:35,465
Mr. Ren and Mrs. Ren

375
00:19:35,746 --> 00:19:36,945
good health,

376
00:19:36,945 --> 00:19:38,065
a very happy New Year

377
00:19:38,266 --> 00:19:39,866
and unlimited happiness and longevity!

378
00:19:40,546 --> 00:19:41,305
Thanks.

379
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:42,465
Look at her.

380
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:43,794
She's one year older

381
00:19:43,819 --> 00:19:44,945
and more sensible now.

382
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:46,185
Enough, enough.

383
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:46,986
Enough, enough.

384
00:19:53,546 --> 00:19:54,906
Red packets.

385
00:19:54,906 --> 00:19:55,666
Thank you.

386
00:19:56,266 --> 00:19:57,065
Thank you very much.

387
00:19:58,705 --> 00:20:00,746
Grandpa, what are you counting?

388
00:20:01,225 --> 00:20:04,065
I just counted that
I still have 13 years to live.

389
00:20:05,386 --> 00:20:05,945
No, no.

390
00:20:07,065 --> 00:20:10,585
May my grandfather
live long and prosper.

391
00:20:11,425 --> 00:20:13,026
Great!

392
00:20:13,026 --> 00:20:13,986
What about me?

393
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:16,705
May my grandma live long forever.

394
00:20:18,345 --> 00:20:19,425
Your grandson said

395
00:20:19,425 --> 00:20:21,465
live long like a tortoise...

396
00:20:22,185 --> 00:20:22,786
Dad!

397
00:20:25,345 --> 00:20:26,386
Give me red packets.

398
00:20:27,506 --> 00:20:28,626
Thank you, Grandpa, Grandma.

399
00:20:31,825 --> 00:20:32,945
You always call me "grandson".

400
00:20:33,026 --> 00:20:34,305
Shouldn't you give me a red packet too?

401
00:20:34,305 --> 00:20:37,666
Sure. Kowtow to me or you can call me...

402
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:40,786
So much!

403
00:20:44,345 --> 00:20:45,906
-It's not appropriate.
-Grandma!

404
00:20:46,305 --> 00:20:47,626
-Don't call me that!
-Grandma!

405
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,386
-Don't call me that.
-Grandma.

406
00:20:50,146 --> 00:20:51,225
-Don't call me that.
-Grandma.

407
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,065
I've called you "grandma".

408
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:56,345
You tricked me!

409
00:20:57,945 --> 00:20:59,666
I've called you "grandma".

410
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:00,585
You must give me a red packet.

411
00:21:02,746 --> 00:21:04,585
This is what celebrating
New Year should look like.

412
00:21:08,386 --> 00:21:09,026
Grandma!

413
00:21:09,026 --> 00:21:11,225
Hurry up and call her. Hurry up!

414
00:21:11,585 --> 00:21:12,626
Hurry up!

415
00:21:19,786 --> 00:21:20,225
Mom.

416
00:21:20,825 --> 00:21:22,266
Slow down, Mom. Wait for me.

417
00:21:22,945 --> 00:21:23,866
Slow down.

418
00:21:25,345 --> 00:21:25,906
Let me take a break.

419
00:21:28,786 --> 00:21:29,266
This...

420
00:21:29,546 --> 00:21:31,105
Your small figure is better than mine.

421
00:21:31,585 --> 00:21:32,866
Who diagnosed you?

422
00:21:32,866 --> 00:21:34,065
I think he is the one who is sick.

423
00:21:36,026 --> 00:21:38,386
You're only in your forties
yet you've become so weak.

424
00:21:38,746 --> 00:21:40,026
You need to exercise.

425
00:21:40,906 --> 00:21:41,506
Mom.

426
00:21:41,986 --> 00:21:43,185
Introduce the TCM practitioner

427
00:21:43,506 --> 00:21:44,585
that you went to.

428
00:21:44,786 --> 00:21:45,585
I'm going to see him too.

429
00:21:47,986 --> 00:21:48,986
I need to hurry up.

430
00:21:49,546 --> 00:21:51,546
I'm running out of time.

431
00:21:51,825 --> 00:21:53,506
I can't leave with regret!

432
00:21:53,506 --> 00:21:54,425
Where are you going?

433
00:21:54,825 --> 00:21:56,705
To the other world!

434
00:21:57,585 --> 00:21:59,506
Mom, with your physique,
it's still early for that.

435
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:03,425
Do you want me to die?

436
00:22:04,225 --> 00:22:04,986
Alright, alright.

437
00:22:05,146 --> 00:22:06,945
I don't need you siblings
to accompany me.

438
00:22:07,465 --> 00:22:08,906
You two can go back.

439
00:22:09,345 --> 00:22:10,506
I can go by myself.

440
00:22:12,585 --> 00:22:14,825
Mom, don't be anxious.
I'll accompany you.

441
00:22:15,146 --> 00:22:16,986
I'll give up my life
to accompany the good man.

442
00:22:17,345 --> 00:22:18,386
Mom, wait for me.

443
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:20,345
Slowly.

444
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:27,866
Mr. Ren, did you look for me?

445
00:22:29,146 --> 00:22:29,986
Mr. Wu!

446
00:22:30,506 --> 00:22:31,465
Happy New Year!

447
00:22:32,026 --> 00:22:32,945
Tou Tou.

448
00:22:34,345 --> 00:22:36,065
She has grown up.
She is different from before.

449
00:22:36,185 --> 00:22:37,105
She's sensible now.

450
00:22:37,345 --> 00:22:38,906
Of course it's different.

451
00:22:39,866 --> 00:22:40,506
Red packet?

452
00:22:40,866 --> 00:22:42,506
Good. She's back to her old self.

453
00:22:42,585 --> 00:22:43,866
What old self?

454
00:22:43,866 --> 00:22:44,986
Mr. Ren gave me a red packet.

455
00:22:44,986 --> 00:22:45,705
Come, give me a red packet.

456
00:22:45,705 --> 00:22:47,345
Let's talk business today.

457
00:22:47,345 --> 00:22:48,986
Business? Give me a red packet first.

458
00:22:49,345 --> 00:22:49,705
Be good.

459
00:22:49,705 --> 00:22:51,666
You're so stingy.

460
00:22:51,786 --> 00:22:53,386
Hurry up. Let's get down to business.

461
00:22:54,146 --> 00:22:54,746
Who are they?

462
00:22:56,746 --> 00:22:59,866
She is the inheritor of
the Jiang family's acupuncture sect,

463
00:22:59,866 --> 00:23:01,185
Sun Tou Tou.

464
00:23:05,825 --> 00:23:07,786
Don't do that. Don't bow to me.

465
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:09,345
You are the elders. I can't accept this.

466
00:23:14,305 --> 00:23:15,465
Don't bow to me.

467
00:23:15,465 --> 00:23:16,425
I didn't prepare red packets.

468
00:23:16,546 --> 00:23:18,626
I didn't collect much this year.

469
00:23:19,825 --> 00:23:20,546
Tou Tou.

470
00:23:21,026 --> 00:23:22,626
Just let us bow to you

471
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,899
to show the gratitude from us,

472
00:23:23,925 --> 00:23:25,945
the overseas disciples.

473
00:23:27,185 --> 00:23:28,065
To tell you the truth,

474
00:23:28,546 --> 00:23:30,225
we've never thought that

475
00:23:30,546 --> 00:23:31,786
in our lifetime,

476
00:23:32,185 --> 00:23:33,506
we can still meet the inheritor of

477
00:23:33,666 --> 00:23:35,866
the Jiang family's acupuncture sect.

478
00:23:36,146 --> 00:23:37,585
We're so lucky.

479
00:23:37,825 --> 00:23:39,065
We didn't expect that.

480
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:41,626
When my husband learned that
someone has inherited

481
00:23:41,906 --> 00:23:43,105
the Jiang family's acupuncture sect,

482
00:23:43,345 --> 00:23:44,546
he was excited for half a year.

483
00:23:44,906 --> 00:23:45,786
Half a year ago,

484
00:23:45,945 --> 00:23:47,825
we booked air tickets to come here

485
00:23:47,945 --> 00:23:49,065
to acknowledge our sect.

486
00:23:49,546 --> 00:23:50,425
For so many years,

487
00:23:50,626 --> 00:23:51,626
we've been using

488
00:23:51,906 --> 00:23:54,666
this acupuncture to save a lot of people.

489
00:23:54,986 --> 00:23:55,866
You can say that

490
00:23:56,906 --> 00:23:57,986
we do not disgrace our sect

491
00:23:58,386 --> 00:23:59,626
and have some success.

492
00:23:59,945 --> 00:24:02,386
The Chinese are
be able to get to know each other

493
00:24:02,465 --> 00:24:04,945
because of
the Jiang family's acupuncture.

494
00:24:05,266 --> 00:24:08,105
Right now, the overseas Chinese
are respected

495
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:08,746
and accepted by others,

496
00:24:09,105 --> 00:24:11,146
and have the current social status.

497
00:24:11,585 --> 00:24:12,585
This is closely related to

498
00:24:12,786 --> 00:24:14,146
the Jiang family's acupuncture.

499
00:24:14,746 --> 00:24:16,546
My senior brothers and sisters

500
00:24:16,945 --> 00:24:18,786
have a huge clinic in San Francisco.

501
00:24:19,146 --> 00:24:20,225
Many foreigners

502
00:24:20,705 --> 00:24:21,866
go to the clinic as it's famous.

503
00:24:22,266 --> 00:24:23,546
When they first come,
they're all carried on stretchers.

504
00:24:23,906 --> 00:24:25,866
But at the end of the treatment,
they can walk out of the clinic.

505
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:27,345
The Jiang family's acupuncture

506
00:24:28,065 --> 00:24:29,305
is so amazing.

507
00:24:34,386 --> 00:24:35,225
Sun Tou Tou.

508
00:24:36,065 --> 00:24:37,626
You're carrying heavy responsibilities.

509
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:41,425
That's right, heavy responsibilities.

510
00:24:42,305 --> 00:24:44,026
Don't stand there. Have a seat.

511
00:24:44,026 --> 00:24:45,266
Come, come.

512
00:24:46,065 --> 00:24:46,866
Have a seat.

513
00:24:47,866 --> 00:24:49,386
-It's not easy.
-Let's have a chat.

514
00:24:49,386 --> 00:24:51,105
For you to come back from overseas.

515
00:24:55,386 --> 00:24:56,026
What is it?

516
00:24:58,746 --> 00:24:59,986
You're good.

517
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:02,546
To make me study hard,

518
00:25:03,386 --> 00:25:05,465
you've put in a lot of effort.

519
00:25:06,185 --> 00:25:08,026
Three. Think about it,
how much are there?

520
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:10,585
Don't try to keep my mouth shut.

521
00:25:10,945 --> 00:25:11,666
Give me some face.

522
00:25:11,866 --> 00:25:12,866
-Give me some face.
-No.

523
00:25:12,986 --> 00:25:13,705
Give me some face.

524
00:25:32,825 --> 00:25:34,305
Excuse me. Thank you.

525
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:35,386
Excuse me.

526
00:25:35,866 --> 00:25:36,465
Here you go, Ms. Xia.

527
00:25:37,065 --> 00:25:37,746
It's enough.

528
00:25:37,746 --> 00:25:38,546
Tou Tou.

529
00:25:39,425 --> 00:25:39,906
What's wrong?

530
00:25:40,026 --> 00:25:41,225
Have you taken your lunch?

531
00:25:41,825 --> 00:25:43,705
There are too many people. I'll not eat.

532
00:25:43,705 --> 00:25:44,786
This won't do.

533
00:25:44,986 --> 00:25:46,906
You'll be exhausted
after treating the patients.

534
00:25:47,105 --> 00:25:47,866
There is another box.

535
00:25:48,945 --> 00:25:49,585
Slowly.

536
00:25:50,185 --> 00:25:50,746
Zhu Xia.

537
00:25:51,386 --> 00:25:52,146
Well...

538
00:25:52,705 --> 00:25:53,213
How much stock of

539
00:25:53,238 --> 00:25:54,786
dried ginger, Cinnamon Twig
and Chinese aconite do we have?

540
00:25:54,786 --> 00:25:55,666
We haven't got the courier package yet?

541
00:25:56,546 --> 00:25:57,585
We still have enough Chinese aconite.

542
00:25:57,585 --> 00:25:59,105
But we don't have much stock left

543
00:25:59,105 --> 00:26:01,065
for dried China root and Cinnamon Twigs.

544
00:26:01,146 --> 00:26:02,585
You saw it too. Look.

545
00:26:02,626 --> 00:26:04,546
Lately, we've had lots of prescriptions.

546
00:26:05,506 --> 00:26:07,465
It'll take some time
for the courier package to get here.

547
00:26:07,626 --> 00:26:09,026
And the pharma companies can only start

548
00:26:09,026 --> 00:26:10,626
their shipment on
the 15th day of the lunar month.

549
00:26:12,345 --> 00:26:13,866
This is how it is after New Year.

550
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:15,225
Next up is the flu.

551
00:26:16,506 --> 00:26:17,746
It's about to change seasons, right?

552
00:26:18,945 --> 00:26:21,425
Don't let Jian Xi
come here these few days.

553
00:26:21,626 --> 00:26:22,825
Look, there are so many people.

554
00:26:23,065 --> 00:26:23,866
You're right.

555
00:26:25,465 --> 00:26:26,945
-Here you go. Take a look.
-This...

556
00:26:28,666 --> 00:26:30,465
These are appointments
for the afternoon?

557
00:26:31,746 --> 00:26:32,786
That's a lot!

558
00:26:32,786 --> 00:26:34,425
We won't be able
to complete it by the evening.

559
00:26:35,065 --> 00:26:37,266
That's all,
we can't take in any patients.

560
00:26:37,266 --> 00:26:38,305
Okay, okay.

561
00:26:43,065 --> 00:26:43,626
Ms. Xia.

562
00:26:45,065 --> 00:26:45,626
Okay.

563
00:26:46,825 --> 00:26:48,345
Jian Xi is alone at home?

564
00:26:49,345 --> 00:26:52,266
Well, Le Le is on winter vacation.

565
00:26:52,266 --> 00:26:54,465
So, I sent her to
Cheng Ying's house in the morning.

566
00:26:54,465 --> 00:26:56,026
The two kids can look after each other.

567
00:26:56,425 --> 00:26:57,626
That's good.

568
00:26:57,626 --> 00:26:59,345
That way, Cheng Ying
and you will be relieved.

569
00:26:59,465 --> 00:27:00,146
That's right.

570
00:27:02,465 --> 00:27:03,146
By the way, Ms. Xia.

571
00:27:03,546 --> 00:27:04,786
Tomorrow, can we cook some

572
00:27:04,786 --> 00:27:06,185
tangerine peel with hawthorn tea

573
00:27:06,185 --> 00:27:07,185
and put it at the reception?

574
00:27:07,345 --> 00:27:10,185
Many patients have had
gastro issues lately.

575
00:27:10,386 --> 00:27:11,225
Okay.

576
00:27:11,225 --> 00:27:12,585
Alright, thanks a lot.

577
00:27:12,585 --> 00:27:13,465
-Don't worry.
-Thanks.

578
00:27:16,026 --> 00:27:17,146
-Ms. Xia.
-Okay.

579
00:27:17,305 --> 00:27:17,945
Please check it.

580
00:27:18,305 --> 00:27:18,786
Here you go.

581
00:27:18,786 --> 00:27:19,546
The list?

582
00:27:20,786 --> 00:27:21,105
Come.

583
00:27:22,225 --> 00:27:23,425
Patients with an appointment,

584
00:27:23,425 --> 00:27:24,746
please come here and get your number.

585
00:27:25,786 --> 00:27:26,945
Wait!

586
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:28,945
Tell me your name.

587
00:27:28,945 --> 00:27:30,105
-Shao Hong!
-Ke Hua!

588
00:27:30,266 --> 00:27:31,065
Shao Hong!

589
00:27:31,345 --> 00:27:31,945
Li with the words "mu" and "zi".

590
00:27:32,386 --> 00:27:32,866
Li with the words "mu" and "zi".

591
00:27:32,866 --> 00:27:33,666
I don't have your name here.

592
00:27:34,065 --> 00:27:35,065
I did.

593
00:27:35,225 --> 00:27:36,585
I didn't manage
to register this morning.

594
00:27:36,666 --> 00:27:37,825
So, I came early in the afternoon.

595
00:27:37,825 --> 00:27:39,786
I have to pick up my grandson
later for his after-school class.

596
00:27:40,026 --> 00:27:41,225
Please give me a number.

597
00:27:41,585 --> 00:27:43,105
Lately, I've had chest tightness.

598
00:27:43,185 --> 00:27:44,585
I want Prof. Ren to have a look.

599
00:27:46,146 --> 00:27:48,266
Did you eat
your hearts out during New Year?

600
00:27:48,746 --> 00:27:50,506
My children only come back once a year.

601
00:27:50,506 --> 00:27:52,506
So, I will prepare
a lot of delicious food.

602
00:27:52,825 --> 00:27:54,465
And I will taste it while cooking.

603
00:27:54,465 --> 00:27:56,666
Well, you don't need
my master to check you.

604
00:27:56,666 --> 00:27:57,786
I can do that.

605
00:27:59,666 --> 00:28:00,906
Yours is karma.

606
00:28:01,666 --> 00:28:04,065
That is to say,
you killed a lot, so you're cursed.

607
00:28:04,065 --> 00:28:06,305
Don't talk nonsense. What karma?

608
00:28:07,506 --> 00:28:08,906
Don't listen to her.

609
00:28:09,585 --> 00:28:11,585
She hasn't even figured out
the basics of TCM.

610
00:28:12,386 --> 00:28:14,866
Didn't you tell Granny Jiang
that it's karma?

611
00:28:14,866 --> 00:28:17,026
Why is it nonsense when I say it?

612
00:28:17,026 --> 00:28:18,345
It's the same situation.

613
00:28:18,585 --> 00:28:19,546
I know about it, so I dared to say.

614
00:28:19,546 --> 00:28:20,746
You don't know anything,
so don't talk nonsense.

615
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,723
You cannot learn something

616
00:28:22,749 --> 00:28:24,319
by imitating something without
understanding the substance.

617
00:28:24,345 --> 00:28:26,266
You're blindly imitating.

618
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:28,825
Don't be anxious.

619
00:28:28,825 --> 00:28:29,666
Please line up.

620
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,705
Everyone will get to see us.

621
00:28:31,866 --> 00:28:33,185
-Tell me your name.
-Okay.

622
00:28:33,185 --> 00:28:33,986
Thank you.

623
00:28:34,866 --> 00:28:36,305
You still have to make an appointment.

624
00:28:36,626 --> 00:28:37,546
We'll see you after the appointment.

625
00:28:37,546 --> 00:28:37,986
I don't have your name here.

626
00:28:37,986 --> 00:28:39,425
-Just give me a number.
-No.

627
00:28:39,425 --> 00:28:40,386
Shao Hong.

628
00:28:40,386 --> 00:28:40,986
Li Xia.

629
00:28:41,026 --> 00:28:41,666
Shao Hong.

630
00:28:43,705 --> 00:28:44,986
Excuse me.

631
00:28:45,705 --> 00:28:46,225
Excuse me.

632
00:28:46,506 --> 00:28:47,465
Add a number for me.

633
00:28:47,945 --> 00:28:49,386
Add a number for me.

634
00:28:49,386 --> 00:28:50,825
I can't do that. It's full today.

635
00:28:50,825 --> 00:28:51,465
You have to make an appointment.

636
00:28:51,465 --> 00:28:52,986
Dear, I can't take it anymore.

637
00:28:52,986 --> 00:28:54,026
Where is the emergency room?

638
00:28:54,305 --> 00:28:55,146
Go... Go and register.

639
00:28:55,146 --> 00:28:56,546
No, this is an emergency.

640
00:28:56,986 --> 00:28:57,906
What are you doing?

641
00:28:58,266 --> 00:28:58,786
No, no!

642
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:01,465
Move back!

643
00:29:01,866 --> 00:29:03,105
Stop it!

644
00:29:03,386 --> 00:29:04,945
I'll buy all your numbers. Come on.

645
00:29:04,945 --> 00:29:06,945
Why do you want to buy the numbers?

646
00:29:07,626 --> 00:29:08,266
Go line up!

647
00:29:08,345 --> 00:29:08,906
Go line up!

648
00:29:08,906 --> 00:29:10,026
Go line up!

649
00:29:29,266 --> 00:29:29,906
Troublesome!

650
00:29:32,866 --> 00:29:33,825
Tou Tou...

651
00:29:33,986 --> 00:29:34,866
What happened?

652
00:29:34,866 --> 00:29:36,425
She's good for only two days.

653
00:29:37,506 --> 00:29:39,225
I just praised her two days ago

654
00:29:39,225 --> 00:29:40,585
but she caused trouble today.

655
00:29:41,626 --> 00:29:43,065
She didn't cause it.

656
00:29:43,065 --> 00:29:44,986
Things pissed her off.

657
00:29:45,786 --> 00:29:47,945
Let's just listen
how she is going to settle things.

658
00:29:57,626 --> 00:29:58,546
This is a medical center,

659
00:29:59,705 --> 00:30:00,746
not a wet market.

660
00:30:03,305 --> 00:30:04,666
This is the place
you come to treat illness,

661
00:30:06,506 --> 00:30:07,825
not the place to buy groceries.

662
00:30:09,546 --> 00:30:11,746
Speaking of which,
all of you are patients.

663
00:30:12,465 --> 00:30:13,185
But your voices

664
00:30:13,986 --> 00:30:15,105
get louder and louder!

665
00:30:16,386 --> 00:30:17,146
Your energy

666
00:30:17,705 --> 00:30:18,866
get stronger and stronger!

667
00:30:20,465 --> 00:30:21,185
Are you sick?

668
00:30:22,386 --> 00:30:23,465
Are you sick?

669
00:30:23,986 --> 00:30:24,825
Who is sick?

670
00:30:25,185 --> 00:30:26,185
Me!

671
00:30:28,386 --> 00:30:30,546
He jumped in line, that's why we argued.

672
00:30:30,945 --> 00:30:31,585
That's right.

673
00:30:32,105 --> 00:30:33,786
Are you comparable to me?

674
00:30:33,786 --> 00:30:35,345
I am Prof. Ren's friend.

675
00:30:35,345 --> 00:30:36,425
We are family friends.

676
00:30:36,425 --> 00:30:37,585
You can't compare with me.

677
00:30:37,906 --> 00:30:38,465
Am I right?

678
00:30:39,225 --> 00:30:40,386
Do you have a ulcer again?

679
00:30:42,026 --> 00:30:43,465
This time, what did you eat?

680
00:30:43,866 --> 00:30:45,185
What are you talking about, dear?

681
00:30:45,185 --> 00:30:46,425
What can I eat?

682
00:30:49,345 --> 00:30:50,146
Just some gamey.

683
00:30:55,546 --> 00:30:56,666
Among the patients,

684
00:30:56,666 --> 00:30:58,465
the last one I want to see is you.

685
00:30:58,825 --> 00:30:59,705
Don't be like that.

686
00:30:59,705 --> 00:31:00,585
Do you know why?

687
00:31:01,386 --> 00:31:02,746
That's because you're covered in germs.

688
00:31:03,185 --> 00:31:04,225
I'm afraid you'll infect me.

689
00:31:04,225 --> 00:31:05,065
Can you please leave?

690
00:31:05,425 --> 00:31:06,666
But I am patient.

691
00:31:06,666 --> 00:31:08,585
I am friends with Prof. Ren

692
00:31:08,786 --> 00:31:09,986
Who is your friend?

693
00:31:11,225 --> 00:31:12,906
My master doesn't have such a friend.

694
00:31:13,345 --> 00:31:15,506
Don't tell others about this.
It's so embarrassing.

695
00:31:16,266 --> 00:31:17,465
Let me tell you. My master

696
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:18,887
is kind-hearted

697
00:31:18,993 --> 00:31:20,146
and he doesn't harm humans or animals.

698
00:31:20,266 --> 00:31:21,465
Even he has to prescribe

699
00:31:21,465 --> 00:31:23,105
medicine with animals,
he doesn't dare to give much.

700
00:31:23,105 --> 00:31:23,825
That's right.

701
00:31:23,825 --> 00:31:24,866
Can he be the same as you?

702
00:31:24,945 --> 00:31:26,026
Can he be your friend?

703
00:31:26,026 --> 00:31:27,666
Can he be friends with someone

704
00:31:27,666 --> 00:31:29,945
who takes on lives and kills animals?

705
00:31:29,945 --> 00:31:31,305
-You...
-Madam.

706
00:31:32,225 --> 00:31:33,305
Yours is not karma.

707
00:31:33,666 --> 00:31:34,585
Yours is karma.

708
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:36,266
The animals that you have eaten...

709
00:31:37,225 --> 00:31:38,305
They turned into hatred

710
00:31:38,705 --> 00:31:39,425
and follow you every day.

711
00:31:39,666 --> 00:31:41,626
Every day, their spirits
in heaven are looking at you.

712
00:31:41,626 --> 00:31:43,225
They'll make you vomit on what you eat.

713
00:31:43,225 --> 00:31:45,026
They'll make you get diarrhea
on what you drink.

714
00:31:45,026 --> 00:31:45,746
Let me tell you.

715
00:31:46,026 --> 00:31:46,786
For this illness of yours,

716
00:31:46,906 --> 00:31:48,105
if you don't take care of your mouth,

717
00:31:48,585 --> 00:31:50,465
even the gods can't save you,
not to mention my master.

718
00:31:50,465 --> 00:31:52,225
-That's right.
-What?

719
00:31:53,266 --> 00:31:54,425
You want me
to lecture you as well, right?

720
00:31:54,705 --> 00:31:55,585
Avoid eating certain foods,

721
00:31:55,746 --> 00:31:56,425
quit drinking

722
00:31:56,546 --> 00:31:57,666
and your daily routine.

723
00:31:57,986 --> 00:31:59,146
Did you do any of it?

724
00:31:59,146 --> 00:32:00,546
Look at your face.

725
00:32:01,266 --> 00:32:02,546
Look at your face.

726
00:32:02,546 --> 00:32:03,065
You...

727
00:32:04,825 --> 00:32:06,626
What's the use of coming here every day?

728
00:32:07,146 --> 00:32:08,786
Are your parents here?

729
00:32:09,386 --> 00:32:09,866
This is bad.

730
00:32:12,425 --> 00:32:12,986
What are you doing?

731
00:32:14,425 --> 00:32:15,506
Just do your work.

732
00:32:20,626 --> 00:32:22,626
Only Tou Tou dares
to teach them a lesson.

733
00:32:22,626 --> 00:32:23,425
I dare not do that.

734
00:32:28,705 --> 00:32:30,065
Your daughter is coughing again, right?

735
00:32:31,266 --> 00:32:32,345
The last time
when you looked at your phone,

736
00:32:32,345 --> 00:32:33,465
your daughter fell into the water.

737
00:32:33,626 --> 00:32:35,146
Coughing is the root cause of it.

738
00:32:35,506 --> 00:32:38,266
You always post the videos of
playing mahjong on your social media.

739
00:32:39,105 --> 00:32:41,185
If you don't take care
of your own child,

740
00:32:41,345 --> 00:32:42,705
who is going
to take care of her for you?

741
00:32:42,945 --> 00:32:45,225
God has been gracious to you

742
00:32:45,666 --> 00:32:47,185
that He didn't take
your child away on that time.

743
00:32:47,746 --> 00:32:49,465
Yet you're not repenting!

744
00:32:54,146 --> 00:32:54,866
You come here again.

745
00:32:55,746 --> 00:32:58,345
Brother, is it so difficult
to go to bed early?

746
00:32:58,746 --> 00:33:00,786
Is it so hard not to stay up late?

747
00:33:00,866 --> 00:33:02,026
And you, uncle.

748
00:33:02,506 --> 00:33:03,345
You quarrel every day.

749
00:33:03,345 --> 00:33:05,386
Look how angry you are.

750
00:33:05,386 --> 00:33:06,266
And you, sister.

751
00:33:07,786 --> 00:33:08,746
You're petty-minded

752
00:33:08,746 --> 00:33:10,026
and want to
take advantage of everything.

753
00:33:10,786 --> 00:33:12,266
You wanted to cut in line
to see a doctor.

754
00:33:13,185 --> 00:33:14,626
And you even used
your grandson as an excuse.

755
00:33:14,626 --> 00:33:15,305
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

756
00:33:18,866 --> 00:33:20,266
This is your health.

757
00:33:20,546 --> 00:33:21,825
If you don't want
to take care of your health,

758
00:33:21,825 --> 00:33:23,225
no one can help you.

759
00:33:24,506 --> 00:33:26,225
It's not that
we don't want to treat you,

760
00:33:26,425 --> 00:33:27,866
no one can cure you.

761
00:33:28,305 --> 00:33:29,386
We've advised you

762
00:33:29,506 --> 00:33:30,506
and prescribed medicine for you.

763
00:33:30,866 --> 00:33:31,705
But you just don't want to listen to us.

764
00:33:32,345 --> 00:33:33,506
You come here every day,

765
00:33:34,105 --> 00:33:35,546
in many, many trips.

766
00:33:35,786 --> 00:33:36,666
You keep coming here.

767
00:33:36,906 --> 00:33:40,065
And you chatter like a fly!

768
00:33:40,065 --> 00:33:41,345
Like a fly.

769
00:33:53,506 --> 00:33:54,185
You guys...

770
00:33:55,546 --> 00:33:57,185
Stay here and wait quietly.

771
00:33:57,825 --> 00:33:59,506
Whoever makes noise again,

772
00:33:59,705 --> 00:34:00,266
please leave.

773
00:34:00,626 --> 00:34:01,345
You don't have to be treated.

774
00:34:01,866 --> 00:34:02,825
I agree!

775
00:34:02,825 --> 00:34:04,225
What do you agree with?

776
00:34:04,305 --> 00:34:05,786
-I...
-Did you have an appointment?

777
00:34:05,786 --> 00:34:07,026
Did you register?

778
00:34:07,026 --> 00:34:09,266
No, that's why I'm looking for you.

779
00:34:09,266 --> 00:34:10,105
Wait there!

780
00:34:10,425 --> 00:34:11,266
Okay.

781
00:34:14,465 --> 00:34:16,506
She's ferocious.

782
00:34:18,825 --> 00:34:19,506
I think

783
00:34:20,465 --> 00:34:21,666
we can hand medicine center

784
00:34:21,666 --> 00:34:23,345
over to Tou Tou in the future.

785
00:34:23,345 --> 00:34:24,146
Ward off the townspeople.

786
00:34:27,425 --> 00:34:28,585
You said that

787
00:34:28,705 --> 00:34:30,705
as doctors, we can't pick our patients.

788
00:34:31,266 --> 00:34:32,305
But look at her.

789
00:34:33,386 --> 00:34:35,866
She chose the patients she likes.

790
00:34:36,266 --> 00:34:38,386
Someone like her can't be a doctor.

791
00:34:39,746 --> 00:34:42,506
I think there are two types of doctors.

792
00:34:42,866 --> 00:34:44,386
One is the evil type.

793
00:34:44,386 --> 00:34:46,065
The other one is the benevolent type.

794
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:49,225
Tou Tou is suitable to be the evil type.

795
00:34:51,185 --> 00:34:52,585
I think that for some patients,

796
00:34:52,585 --> 00:34:53,945
we can't always spoil them.

797
00:34:54,386 --> 00:34:55,945
We can't be always kind to them.

798
00:34:56,185 --> 00:34:56,786
We should scold them

799
00:34:57,105 --> 00:34:57,866
at the right time.

800
00:34:59,786 --> 00:35:01,225
Tou Tou scolded

801
00:35:01,225 --> 00:35:02,345
those we wanted to scold

802
00:35:02,546 --> 00:35:04,626
but dare not to scold for many years.

803
00:35:05,465 --> 00:35:07,026
That's because
we can't let ourselves down.

804
00:35:09,026 --> 00:35:09,546
You...

805
00:35:10,546 --> 00:35:12,705
You don't want
to be kind-hearted anymore?

806
00:35:14,705 --> 00:35:16,225
After Tou Tou scolded them,

807
00:35:16,225 --> 00:35:18,185
we will be the kind-hearted ones.

808
00:35:20,425 --> 00:35:21,786
Gosh, you're vicious.

809
00:35:37,026 --> 00:35:38,146
You're here.

810
00:35:41,185 --> 00:35:42,465
This time, what did you eat?

811
00:35:44,026 --> 00:35:45,385
Well, during New Year,

812
00:35:45,826 --> 00:35:47,266
I had some gamey.

813
00:35:48,185 --> 00:35:48,986
I didn't hold myself back.

814
00:35:49,385 --> 00:35:51,185
Well, it's the cold weather.

815
00:35:51,506 --> 00:35:53,705
So, I ate ginseng to keep warmth.

816
00:35:54,066 --> 00:35:55,546
Then, I became like this.

817
00:35:56,465 --> 00:35:58,306
Your life is hanging by a thread

818
00:35:58,306 --> 00:36:00,145
yet you dare to do this.

819
00:36:01,106 --> 00:36:02,705
Can't you be an ordinary man

820
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:05,026
who eats radish and cabbage?

821
00:36:05,225 --> 00:36:05,705
That's not it.

822
00:36:06,385 --> 00:36:07,506
Look.

823
00:36:07,506 --> 00:36:10,306
We only live our lives
for a few decades.

824
00:36:10,826 --> 00:36:12,865
If I can't eat whatever I want

825
00:36:12,865 --> 00:36:14,346
and drink whatever I want,

826
00:36:14,346 --> 00:36:15,705
what's the point of living then?

827
00:36:16,145 --> 00:36:19,026
This adult world is very tough already.

828
00:36:19,266 --> 00:36:20,026
Look at me.

829
00:36:20,665 --> 00:36:21,266
I don't gamble

830
00:36:21,705 --> 00:36:22,465
and I do not go to prostitutes.

831
00:36:23,026 --> 00:36:24,425
I just like to eat delicious food.

832
00:36:24,665 --> 00:36:26,266
If I really do like you say,

833
00:36:26,266 --> 00:36:27,826
which is avoid eating this and that,

834
00:36:28,185 --> 00:36:29,185
and live unhappily

835
00:36:29,385 --> 00:36:30,546
until the age of 120,

836
00:36:31,385 --> 00:36:32,546
what's the point of it?

837
00:36:32,945 --> 00:36:34,026
It hurts, right?

838
00:36:35,465 --> 00:36:37,185
You feel the pain, don't you?

839
00:36:39,865 --> 00:36:41,306
You said this before.

840
00:36:41,506 --> 00:36:43,385
We must keep being happy.

841
00:36:43,746 --> 00:36:45,425
I ate hot food

842
00:36:45,425 --> 00:36:46,865
after I had cold food.

843
00:36:47,066 --> 00:36:49,266
I was happy when I was eating.

844
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:52,026
After eating, my heart was at peace.

845
00:36:52,586 --> 00:36:54,145
I'm in pain now,

846
00:36:54,385 --> 00:36:55,905
but my mind is healthy.

847
00:36:56,306 --> 00:36:57,145
Didn't you say that

848
00:36:57,746 --> 00:37:00,346
we should have a healthy body and mind?

849
00:37:00,826 --> 00:37:01,905
What matters most

850
00:37:02,225 --> 00:37:03,185
is the mind.

851
00:37:04,306 --> 00:37:06,306
Your mind isn't healthy.

852
00:37:06,546 --> 00:37:09,026
God has arranged
so much delicious food for us.

853
00:37:09,026 --> 00:37:09,826
But you don't eat them.

854
00:37:10,786 --> 00:37:12,705
You prefer to eat that other food.

855
00:37:13,026 --> 00:37:16,986
You have an unhealthy body and mind.

856
00:37:19,586 --> 00:37:20,865
I have you.

857
00:37:21,225 --> 00:37:23,026
You are my greatest strength.

858
00:37:23,026 --> 00:37:24,346
Stop talking nonsense.

859
00:37:24,586 --> 00:37:27,546
My master won't
take the blame for your bad deeds.

860
00:37:27,705 --> 00:37:29,066
This is not a bad deed.

861
00:37:29,066 --> 00:37:30,465
Mr. Ren, he ate a lot of gamey

862
00:37:30,465 --> 00:37:31,465
which he shouldn't be eaten.

863
00:37:31,465 --> 00:37:32,665
He didn't listen to you either.

864
00:37:33,066 --> 00:37:34,786
And you can't control him.
Just forget about it.

865
00:37:35,865 --> 00:37:36,705
How about we call the police?

866
00:37:37,306 --> 00:37:39,465
But just like what she said,

867
00:37:39,746 --> 00:37:40,786
we should call the police.

868
00:37:40,786 --> 00:37:41,346
That's right.

869
00:37:42,465 --> 00:37:45,185
No, no. Stop fooling around.

870
00:37:47,106 --> 00:37:48,546
Look at this girl.

871
00:37:49,385 --> 00:37:49,986
Dr. Ren.

872
00:37:50,586 --> 00:37:52,665
Among your apprentices, she's the one

873
00:37:52,905 --> 00:37:54,026
who has delicate features.

874
00:37:54,026 --> 00:37:56,145
You have a hot temper
and you're powerful.

875
00:37:56,385 --> 00:37:58,506
She and you are like Ying and Yang,

876
00:37:58,506 --> 00:37:59,586
a very good combination.

877
00:37:59,705 --> 00:38:00,346
Very good combination.

878
00:38:00,346 --> 00:38:01,385
Stop talking nonsense.

879
00:38:01,385 --> 00:38:03,106
She's not my apprentice.

880
00:38:03,986 --> 00:38:05,465
She is my master.

881
00:38:06,225 --> 00:38:07,986
She came to change me.

882
00:38:41,066 --> 00:38:41,945
Roubecca.

883
00:38:42,625 --> 00:38:44,385
This is Zhu Chang Ming's prescription.

884
00:38:45,425 --> 00:38:46,865
Put it over there.
I'll prepare it later.

885
00:38:47,586 --> 00:38:47,986
Okay.

886
00:38:49,385 --> 00:38:51,665
I noticed that
you didn't sign up for the class

887
00:38:51,905 --> 00:38:52,826
on picking herbs from the mountains.

888
00:38:52,826 --> 00:38:53,346
Why is that?

889
00:38:53,546 --> 00:38:55,546
Aren't you a top student?
You're always proactive.

890
00:38:55,705 --> 00:38:56,865
I'm a little curious.

891
00:38:58,786 --> 00:39:00,026
Being a top student alone is not enough.

892
00:39:00,665 --> 00:39:01,826
I need to be a "top mother".

893
00:39:05,185 --> 00:39:06,066
What do you mean?

894
00:39:06,705 --> 00:39:07,506
This time,

895
00:39:07,705 --> 00:39:09,106
you learn well on my behalf.

896
00:39:09,506 --> 00:39:10,905
I have to complete

897
00:39:10,905 --> 00:39:12,145
the most important event in my life.

898
00:39:12,586 --> 00:39:13,905
Moreover, if all of you go to the class,

899
00:39:13,905 --> 00:39:15,945
I need to take care of
the medical center as it's busy.

900
00:39:17,465 --> 00:39:18,465
Let me prepare the herbs on your behalf.

901
00:39:18,786 --> 00:39:20,185
-It's alright.
-I'm late!

902
00:39:21,786 --> 00:39:23,506
Zhao Li Quan, what time is it now?

903
00:39:23,506 --> 00:39:25,145
There were many patients in the morning.

904
00:39:25,665 --> 00:39:26,705
I'm sorry.

905
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:28,465
Xing Xing had a fever last night.

906
00:39:28,705 --> 00:39:29,905
I came here
after I made the medicine for her

907
00:39:29,905 --> 00:39:31,225
and gave her a simple massage.

908
00:39:31,546 --> 00:39:33,385
She's having a fever? Why?

909
00:39:33,986 --> 00:39:35,066
I guess she's tired.

910
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:36,905
The hospital also
has its busiest time now.

911
00:39:37,225 --> 00:39:38,185
Let me go and change my clothes first.

912
00:39:42,385 --> 00:39:43,506
Please apply for leave for me.

913
00:39:45,786 --> 00:39:46,705
Apply for leave?

914
00:40:07,865 --> 00:40:10,506
You come and see it three times a day.
What have you got?

915
00:40:11,705 --> 00:40:13,945
It usually looks good,
with lots of leaves.

916
00:40:14,346 --> 00:40:17,705
Yet you pruned it.

917
00:40:17,826 --> 00:40:19,225
You even built a warm house for it.

918
00:40:19,546 --> 00:40:20,546
The tomato

919
00:40:20,826 --> 00:40:21,905
is dead now.

920
00:40:25,586 --> 00:40:27,145
I had good intentions,
but I guess it's too much for it.

921
00:40:28,506 --> 00:40:29,945
I don't want this to happen either.

922
00:40:53,586 --> 00:40:55,425
Are you still feeling not well?

923
00:40:57,266 --> 00:40:58,026
No.

924
00:40:58,225 --> 00:40:59,665
I feel better after taking the medicine.

925
00:40:59,865 --> 00:41:00,945
Zhao Li Quan said

926
00:41:00,945 --> 00:41:03,026
you drank the Chinese medicine he made.

927
00:41:03,665 --> 00:41:05,185
I had taken the cold medicine

928
00:41:05,266 --> 00:41:07,106
but he insisted on
making the medicine for me.

929
00:41:09,746 --> 00:41:11,145
Your pulse looks fine.

930
00:41:11,425 --> 00:41:12,506
As long as the fever has subsided.

931
00:41:13,506 --> 00:41:14,826
Have a rest. I'll get you some water.

932
00:41:18,746 --> 00:41:19,546
Oh right, Xing Xing.

933
00:41:20,586 --> 00:41:21,826
When you're free,

934
00:41:22,106 --> 00:41:24,145
please sell my comics on my behalf.

935
00:41:24,306 --> 00:41:25,266
I'm not reading them anymore.

936
00:41:25,306 --> 00:41:26,465
And I can get some money from it.

937
00:41:27,185 --> 00:41:27,665
Alright.

938
00:41:29,425 --> 00:41:30,346
It's hot, be careful.

939
00:41:31,625 --> 00:41:32,225
Blow it.

940
00:41:34,306 --> 00:41:36,625
Zhao Li Quan and you live together.

941
00:41:38,266 --> 00:41:40,425
Don't you have any sparks?

942
00:41:42,586 --> 00:41:44,346
He is a TCM practitioner
while I'm a doctor.

943
00:41:45,786 --> 00:41:46,586
What's wrong with that?

944
00:41:47,066 --> 00:41:48,865
Well, it's not associated.

945
00:41:49,185 --> 00:41:50,106
What are you talking about?

946
00:41:50,546 --> 00:41:51,986
One is the doctor
for traditional Chinese medicine

947
00:41:51,986 --> 00:41:53,145
while the other one
is a nurse for Western medicine.

948
00:41:53,145 --> 00:41:54,306
It's a perfect couple.

949
00:41:54,306 --> 00:41:55,746
How could you say it's not associated?

950
00:41:56,066 --> 00:41:57,026
What a match!

951
00:41:59,546 --> 00:42:00,705
Don't you think that

952
00:42:01,586 --> 00:42:03,425
two is better than one?

953
00:42:03,705 --> 00:42:05,346
For example, you're sick today

954
00:42:05,665 --> 00:42:06,905
and he could prepare medicine for you.

955
00:42:07,106 --> 00:42:08,625
What would have happened to you
if I had not come back in time?

956
00:42:11,425 --> 00:42:12,546
Well, actually...

957
00:42:15,306 --> 00:42:16,306
Occasionally

958
00:42:16,625 --> 00:42:18,546
I do feel

959
00:42:18,746 --> 00:42:20,385
something.

960
00:42:20,865 --> 00:42:21,986
When the two of us

961
00:42:22,865 --> 00:42:24,465
resting at home,

962
00:42:26,746 --> 00:42:29,066
we talk and eat together.

963
00:42:29,945 --> 00:42:31,385
When I come home late
from the night shift,

964
00:42:31,625 --> 00:42:33,385
he waits for me at the small alley.

965
00:42:33,385 --> 00:42:34,665
I feel warmth, actually.

966
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:37,746
But each time I have this thought,

967
00:42:38,826 --> 00:42:40,066
I will pull myself back.

968
00:42:41,026 --> 00:42:41,586
I

969
00:42:43,346 --> 00:42:44,106
cannot...

970
00:42:44,665 --> 00:42:45,746
I cannot choose him.

971
00:42:51,679 --> 00:42:53,089
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

972
00:42:53,115 --> 00:42:54,454
(are referenced from relevant
traditional Chinese medicine books)

973
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,818
