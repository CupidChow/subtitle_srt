1
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:07,440
That's why
you couldn't be the inheritor.

2
00:00:07,814 --> 00:00:08,940
I need to do it.

3
00:00:09,024 --> 00:00:10,433
I need to do this kind of thing.

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,597
You've gotten too deep into this.

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,160
Oh, right. I suddenly remembered this.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,080
You said you wanted
to bungee jump at Feilong Canyon, right?

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,720
I heard it's closed now.

8
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,077
You can't go there.
Change to another place.

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:22,960
No.

10
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,040
This is the reason I want to go there.

11
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,200
Ren Tian Zhen, are you crazy?

12
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,480
It's New Year now.
Don't make me scold you.

13
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,400
You don't understand
the realm of masters.

14
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,077
I'm going to beat you to death!

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,880
-What are you doing?
-What am I doing?

16
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,760
Human should cherish their lives.

17
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,480
Don't say such nonsense again.

18
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,757
Cherish your life.

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,717
Your life not only belongs to you alone.

20
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,080
It belongs to the one you love too.

21
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,240
You're like Jian Xi.

22
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,957
Her life not only belongs to her.

23
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,200
It belongs to her mother and Cheng Ying.

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,240
What do you know? You brat know nothing!

25
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,840
You've changed!

26
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,480
Previously, you ran a red light
and went the opposite way on a scooter.

27
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,480
Why have you become like
a director of teaching and learning now?

28
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,320
Tell me about it. What happened?
What's the matter?

29
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:18,920
Alright.

30
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,520
Let me see how long you can hold back.

31
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,400
Such a big gourd.

32
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:29,840
And pumpkin.

33
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:49,920
Hello, Tou Tou.

34
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,320
That's right. You go to the exit first.

35
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,560
I'll drive the car over.

36
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,920
We have to hurry up. They're waiting
for us at home to make dumplings.

37
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,720
Okay.

38
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,917
Brother!

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,440
Hello! Hi, Mdm. Wang.

40
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,680
Li Quan, you're back.

41
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,240
Granny.

42
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,640
-Li Quan, you're back.
-Li Quan.

43
00:02:24,126 --> 00:02:25,197
-Li Quan.
-Ms. Liu.

44
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,446
You're back.

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,840
Granny Kang!

46
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,517
I wish you have a long life.

47
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,000
Happy New Year!

48
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,520
Happy New Year, mister.

49
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,880
Li Quan, you're back!

50
00:02:55,964 --> 00:02:57,038
Mdm. Zhang.

51
00:02:57,121 --> 00:02:58,240
You came back for New Year.

52
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,520
Yes, I'm back.

53
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,720
Has Zhang come back?

54
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:01,878
He is?

55
00:03:01,961 --> 00:03:02,920
He's back.

56
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,360
Li Quan, you're back.

57
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,437
Dad, Mom, Brother is back.

58
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,120
-Mom!
-Quan! You're back!

59
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,120
Mom!

60
00:03:22,482 --> 00:03:23,436
You're finally home.

61
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,559
Brother, what delicious food
did you bring for me?

62
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,899
They are all there.

63
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,686
You only know how to eat.

64
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,560
Come, try it.

65
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,677
Dad, Quan is home!

66
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,237
Mom, try it.

67
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,840
-What is this?
-Something tasty.

68
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,760
Brother.

69
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,680
This is a molten sesame ball!

70
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,520
My classmates will envy me.

71
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,120
My brother brought me these
from the big city.

72
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,800
And some toys too. Here you go.

73
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:52,960
Thank you, Brother.

74
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,277
You're not young anymore.
Why are you still playing with toys?

75
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,160
Li Quan!

76
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,360
Eat your snack.

77
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,600
-You're back.
-Dad!

78
00:03:58,806 --> 00:03:59,900
What's wrong with your leg?

79
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,677
I don't know either.
I couldn't describe it.

80
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,517
I just feel pain.

81
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,400
Come.

82
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,880
He's so painful that
he couldn't sleep these days.

83
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,277
Check his leg.

84
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,160
Take a seat.

85
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,317
This side?

86
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,200
Yes.

87
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,040
Be gentle.
You have a bruise, Dad.

88
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,460
Did you seethe?

89
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,620
Rheumatism.

90
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,280
It happened
after he worked in the fields.

91
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,277
He works in the fields.

92
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,400
You work in the fields too.

93
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,520
Why didn't you have rheumatism?

94
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,000
Who knows?

95
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,720
Dad.

96
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,600
It's okay, relax.

97
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,560
Don't keep getting angry.

98
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,600
I'll treat you with acupuncture
these few days

99
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,400
and massage for you.
You'll be recovered.

100
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,280
How can I be relaxed?

101
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,880
Whenever something bad happens
to your mom, she will scold me.

102
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,000
She is relaxed,
but I keep all the anger.

103
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,560
Why did she scold you?

104
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,800
About your brother.

105
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,600
I told him several times.

106
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,400
I don't want him to study anymore.

107
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,920
But he won't listen.

108
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,957
He said he wants to learn from you.

109
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,197
He wants to study in the city.

110
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,520
He wants to be a city resident.

111
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,240
Dad, listen to me.

112
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,600
It doesn't matter
if one becomes a city resident.

113
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,920
But he must study.

114
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,760
Son.

115
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,360
Our family can't afford it.

116
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,120
Moreover, you two will live in the city.

117
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,520
We're getting older.

118
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,440
Tell me. Who will run the household?

119
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,560
That's right.

120
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,480
We'll be bullied when no one is at home.

121
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,240
Just like our fish pond.

122
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,000
Many people are eyeing it.

123
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,080
Dad.

124
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,360
How about we use the toys

125
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,440
Quan bought

126
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,640
and give them to
the village head's grandson

127
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,280
to flatter him?

128
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,797
We still have to work
for another ten years.

129
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,640
After ten years,
your brother will graduate.

130
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,720
Right.

131
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,440
Dad, Mom.

132
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,800
I don't have much savings for this year.

133
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,160
I've prepared red packets for you two.

134
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,400
Happy New Year, Dad.

135
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,120
Happy New Year, Mom.

136
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,680
Only this much?

137
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,440
Being a doctor doesn't make money?

138
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,880
Well, I just started.

139
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,400
And it's TCM practitioner.

140
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,120
Well,

141
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,280
in order to send you to school,

142
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,120
we borrowed a lot of money.

143
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,800
This is not enough to pay them back.

144
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,520
What are you talking about?

145
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,800
This is his thoughts.

146
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,560
He just got started.

147
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,640
Next year. It'll be good next year.

148
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,917
Quan, don't listen to your dad.

149
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,197
He doesn't know how to say good words.

150
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,160
In fact, he looked forward
to your return the most.

151
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,360
You know, he went
to the market two days ago.

152
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,520
Look.

153
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,040
He bought the new cotton quilt.

154
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,320
It's so soft!

155
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,400
Quan, do you have any new clothes?

156
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,360
Change into it.

157
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,920
Why? These are good.

158
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,520
You don't look like a city resident.

159
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,920
Go to the village head's house with me.

160
00:06:50,153 --> 00:06:51,157
That's right.

161
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,357
Why are we going
to the village head's house?

162
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,280
For a blind date!

163
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,200
The village head's niece,

164
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,477
your classmate, Wang Ying Hua,

165
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,360
do you still remember her?

166
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,237
If you two get married,

167
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,317
our family will become great.

168
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,717
We'll become powerful

169
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,680
and don't have
to look at their long faces.

170
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,877
Mom, I don't want to go.

171
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,478
Go take a look.
Son.

172
00:07:10,561 --> 00:07:12,960
Wang Ying Hua's father
is the current deputy county mayor.

173
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,357
It's such a good fate.

174
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,158
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

175
00:07:15,241 --> 00:07:16,246
Let's go together.

176
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:17,597
The daughter of
the deputy county mayor

177
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,757
is out of my league!

178
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,077
Who says that?

179
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,397
You're now a city resident!

180
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,797
You're educated
and work in a big hospital.

181
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,957
And your mentor is the principal, right?

182
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,957
I've told them that

183
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,637
in the future,
you're the director of the hospital!

184
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,997
-That's right.
-You're out of her league!

185
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,357
Dad, don't talk nonsense!

186
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,317
-What nonsense?
-Other people have heard you!

187
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,837
What are you afraid of?
I didn't talk nonsense!

188
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,117
-Let's go!
-Dad, I'm not going! Dad!

189
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,957
-Let's go!
-I don't want to go on a blind date.

190
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,840
Let's go!

191
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,160
Li Xin!

192
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,440
Pull me!

193
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,760
Let's go, son.

194
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,237
It's such a wonderful thing.

195
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,920
Dad, I'm not going!

196
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:01,280
("Li" means the beginning)

197
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,560
("Chun" means warmth, fine Spring days)

198
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,320
(Ploughing and sowing in Spring
make the plants stronger)

199
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,400
(The period between solar terms
of Lichun to Lixia is known as "Spring")

200
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,880
(Lichun, the beginning of spring)

201
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,000
Great!

202
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:41,960
Grandpa.

203
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,840
I think there's too much dough.

204
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,160
We only have these fillings.

205
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,480
It's alright.

206
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,400
I'll cook

207
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,160
dough-ball soup with it.

208
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,717
I'll add some Chinese white cabbage,
tomato, and others

209
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,157
and cook it in a pot.
It's going to be delicious.

210
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,040
It's okay if there's a lot.

211
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,760
You could sound plausible
when it comes to food.

212
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,480
You talk the talk.

213
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,840
This saying is good.

214
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,437
"Losing one's integrity
is a small matter,

215
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,357
but starving to death is a big one."

216
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,240
Am I right, Grandpa?

217
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,440
Am I right, Grandma?

218
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,800
With Tou Tou here this year,

219
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,880
our New Year is more exciting.

220
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,320
Look at Mom and Dad.

221
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,800
They're so happy.

222
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,960
I think this is the first time

223
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,117
Tou Tou celebrates New Year
with the family.

224
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,440
Write couplets...

225
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,360
Put up New Year paintings...

226
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,957
Discard old stuff and buy new ones...

227
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,880
Prepare dumplings...
Watch TV...

228
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,480
She's curious about everything.

229
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,600
Actually,

230
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,997
we do all these

231
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,320
just for the children.

232
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,520
You're right.

233
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,480
Look, I'm doing it in one breath.

234
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,840
I'm sorry.

235
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,960
Be careful.

236
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,317
Again.

237
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,520
Alright. Tie it up.

238
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,520
Done.

239
00:10:02,407 --> 00:10:03,327
You've scared me!

240
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,680
What's wrong?

241
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,680
No,

242
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,480
You'll hurt your eyes!
You naughty girl!

243
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,957
If we can't play
the firecrackers during New Year,

244
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,520
we should pop the balloons.

245
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,800
They're popping the balloons.

246
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,880
My god.

247
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,160
You're right.

248
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,400
It's so much more fun

249
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,760
with her in our home.

250
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,000
Her movement

251
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,920
is getting bigger now.

252
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,000
But

253
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,200
my little heart

254
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,040
can't stand it.

255
00:10:33,573 --> 00:10:34,517
Hurry up.

256
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,840
My little heart is fine.

257
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,837
The dumplings are ready!

258
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,280
Let's eat dumplings!

259
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,440
Dumplings with two types of fillings.

260
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,240
This is fun!

261
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,760
Enough.

262
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,440
Quan.

263
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,240
Is it cold?

264
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,000
It's not cold, Mom.

265
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,637
I've prepared a hot water bag for you

266
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,040
to put in the quilt.

267
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,200
Thank you, Mom.

268
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,680
Have you tried on the suit
for the blind date?

269
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,400
Your dad spent
a lot of his money for it.

270
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,000
Try it and see if it's suitable.

271
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,720
Later, I'll iron it.

272
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,000
Mom.

273
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,720
I don't want to go on a blind date.

274
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,280
Why?

275
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,560
You don't like Wang Ying Hua?

276
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,520
Just meet her first.

277
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,000
Feelings can be cultivated.

278
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:51,840
Quan.

279
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,760
Tell me honestly.

280
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,480
Do you

281
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,440
have a girl you like?

282
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,520
No, Mom.

283
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,520
Who would like

284
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,440
people like me?

285
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,520
What's wrong?

286
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,400
What's wrong with you?

287
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,677
You'll become

288
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,800
a hospital director in a big city.

289
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,800
Mom, you said that again.

290
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,240
Dad and you keep saying this
since I came back.

291
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,917
People will laugh at us
if they hear this.

292
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,197
Why should they laugh at us?

293
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,400
This is bound to happen.

294
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,637
Bound to happen?

295
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,040
It's not going to happen.

296
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,120
Do you really have someone you like?

297
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,437
Where is her hometown?

298
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,357
How old is she?

299
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,277
Is she pretty?

300
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,160
Mom.

301
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,397
If I really have someone I like,

302
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,120
I'll bring her back to meet you, okay?

303
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,120
You must have someone already.

304
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,880
Be gentle.

305
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,280
You're still awake?

306
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,040
I...

307
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,560
I hate you!

308
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,800
Tou Tou.

309
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,480
I think the new clothes are nice.

310
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,200
New clothes for New Year.

311
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,840
I know.

312
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,120
I can understand the red color.

313
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,920
I can understand about
it being a sweater as well.

314
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,360
The thing is...

315
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,360
The thing is, what do the flowers mean?

316
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,477
These big flowers alone

317
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,557
made me feel like

318
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,560
I'm not having a good New Year.

319
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,160
The flowers are beautiful.

320
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,320
That's not it.

321
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,560
These flowers indicate that

322
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:33,920
you'll make

323
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,037
great progress in the new year.

324
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,200
You'll have greater joy.

325
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,720
Mr. Ren.

326
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,397
I actually think
my black clothes are nice.

327
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,317
Whatever colors the clothes are...

328
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,440
Red looks good.

329
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,960
No one wears black clothes
on the first day of New Year.

330
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,600
The joy of red.

331
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,320
Flourishing and prosperous.

332
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,037
-Come here, quick.
-Go.

333
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,360
We're giving out the red packets.

334
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,680
What?

335
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,800
Why...

336
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,717
I'm an adult now.

337
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,477
I can still get the red packets?

338
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,477
If you are not married
and haven't got kids yet,

339
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,197
you'll always be our child.

340
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,677
When you get married and have children,

341
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,560
you're qualified to be an adult.

342
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:09,917
Look.

343
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,477
How boring it is if we can't

344
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,517
give out the red packets
during New Year.

345
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,960
Tian Zhen, bring the cushion over.

346
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,757
I'm finally not alone this year.

347
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,800
I've been kowtowing alone every year.

348
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,800
Kowtow?

349
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,320
-Come.
-Come, Tou Tou.

350
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,760
Lightly.

351
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,640
Just say a few auspicious words.

352
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,240
Wait a minute.

353
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:42,877
What's wrong?

354
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,597
Come quickly!
Come quickly.

355
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,317
-What are you doing?
-Come. Hurry up.

356
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,677
Come, come.

357
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,277
Stand here. Stand properly.

358
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,160
Stand here.

359
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,360
Stand still.

360
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,517
I wish Mr. Song and Mrs. Song,

361
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,360
Mr. Ren and Mrs. Ren

362
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,757
good health,

363
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,960
a very happy New Year

364
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,760
and unlimited happiness and longevity!

365
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,240
Thanks.

366
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,360
Look at her.

367
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,637
She's one year older

368
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,840
and more sensible now.

369
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:10,997
Enough, enough.

370
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:11,880
Enough, enough.

371
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,717
Red packets.

372
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,600
Thank you.

373
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:21,960
Thank you very much.

374
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,640
Grandpa, what are you counting?

375
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,960
I just counted that
I still have 13 years to live.

376
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,080
No, no.

377
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,480
May my grandfather
live long and prosper.

378
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,837
Great!

379
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,880
What about me?

380
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,600
May my grandma live long forever.

381
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,237
Your grandson said

382
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,360
live long like a tortoise...

383
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:47,880
Dad!

384
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,280
Give me red packets.

385
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,520
Thank you, Grandpa, Grandma.

386
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,837
You always call me "grandson".

387
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,117
Shouldn't you give me a red packet too?

388
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,560
Sure. Kowtow to me or you can call me...

389
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,800
So much!

390
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,800
-It's not appropriate.
-Grandma!

391
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,520
-Don't call me that!
-Grandma!

392
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,280
-Don't call me that.
-Grandma.

393
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,120
-Don't call me that.
-Grandma.

394
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,960
I've called you "grandma".

395
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,360
You tricked me!

396
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,477
I've called you "grandma".

397
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,480
You must give me a red packet.

398
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,480
This is what celebrating
New Year should look like.

399
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,838
Grandma!

400
00:19:33,921 --> 00:19:36,240
Hurry up and call her. Hurry up!

401
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,520
Hurry up!

402
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,480
Mom.

403
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,160
Slow down, Mom. Wait for me.

404
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,760
Slow down.

405
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,040
Let me take a break.

406
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,000
This...
Your small figure is better than mine.

407
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,677
Who diagnosed you?

408
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,960
I think he is the one who is sick.

409
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,280
You're only in your forties
yet you've become so weak.

410
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,920
You need to exercise.

411
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,600
Mom.

412
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,080
Introduce the TCM practitioner

413
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,480
that you went to.

414
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,480
I'm going to see him too.

415
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,880
I need to hurry up.

416
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,440
I'm running out of time.

417
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,317
I can't leave with regret!

418
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,320
Where are you going?

419
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,600
To the other world!

420
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,400
Mom, with your physique,
it's still early for that.

421
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,320
Do you want me to die?

422
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:29,920
Alright, alright.

423
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,840
I don't need you siblings
to accompany me.

424
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,800
You two can go back.

425
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,400
I can go by myself.

426
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,720
Mom, don't be anxious.
I'll accompany you.

427
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,880
I'll give up my life
to accompany the good man.

428
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,280
Mom, wait for me.

429
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,240
Slowly.

430
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,760
Mr. Ren, did you look for me?

431
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:54,880
Mr. Wu!

432
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,360
Happy New Year!

433
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,840
Tou Tou.

434
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,960
She has grown up.
She is different from before.

435
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,000
She's sensible now.

436
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,800
Of course it's different.

437
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,560
Red packet?

438
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,397
Good. She's back to her old self.

439
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,677
What old self?

440
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,553
Mr. Ren gave me a red packet.

441
00:21:09,637 --> 00:21:10,518
Come, give me a red packet.

442
00:21:10,601 --> 00:21:12,157
Let's talk business today.

443
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,880
Business? Give me a red packet first.

444
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,560
-Be good.
-You're so stingy.

445
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,280
Hurry up. Let's get down to business.

446
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,040
Who are they?

447
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,677
She is the inheritor of
the Jiang family's acupuncture sect,

448
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,080
Sun Tou Tou.

449
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,597
Don't do that. Don't bow to me.

450
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,240
You are the elders. I can't accept this.

451
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,277
Don't bow to me.

452
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,320
I didn't prepare red packets.

453
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,520
I didn't collect much this year.

454
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,520
Tou Tou.

455
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,520
Just let us bow to you

456
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,757
to show the gratitude from us,

457
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,840
the overseas disciples.

458
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:52,960
To tell you the truth,

459
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,120
we've never thought that

460
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,680
in our lifetime,

461
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,400
we can still meet the inheritor of

462
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,760
the Jiang family's acupuncture sect.

463
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,480
We're so lucky.

464
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,960
We didn't expect that.

465
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,520
When my husband learned that
someone has inherited

466
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,000
the Jiang family's acupuncture sect,

467
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,440
he was excited for half a year.

468
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,680
Half a year ago,

469
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,720
we booked air tickets to come here

470
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,960
to acknowledge our sect.

471
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,320
For so many years,

472
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,520
we've been using

473
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,560
this acupuncture to save a lot of people.

474
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,760
You can say that

475
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,880
we do not disgrace our sect

476
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,520
and have some success.

477
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,277
The Chinese are
be able to get to know each other

478
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,840
because of
the Jiang family's acupuncture.

479
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,957
Right now, the overseas Chinese
are respected

480
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:33,840
and accepted by others,

481
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,040
and have the current social status.

482
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,480
This is closely related to

483
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,040
the Jiang family's acupuncture.

484
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,440
My senior brothers and sisters

485
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,680
have a huge clinic in San Francisco.

486
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,120
Many foreigners

487
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,760
go to the clinic as it's famous.

488
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,440
When they first come,
they're all carried on stretchers.

489
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,760
But at the end of the treatment,
they can walk out of the clinic.

490
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,240
The Jiang family's acupuncture

491
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,200
is so amazing.

492
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,120
Sun Tou Tou.

493
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,520
You're carrying heavy responsibilities.

494
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,320
That's right, heavy responsibilities.

495
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,837
Don't stand there. Have a seat.

496
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,160
Come, come.

497
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,760
Have a seat.

498
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,197
-It's not easy.
-Let's have a chat.

499
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,000
For you to come back from overseas.

500
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,080
What is it?

501
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,880
You're good.

502
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,440
To make me study hard,

503
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,360
you've put in a lot of effort.

504
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,920
Three. Think about it,
how much are there?

505
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,480
Don't try to keep my mouth shut.

506
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,640
Give me some face.

507
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,760
-Give me some face.
-No.

508
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,680
Give me some face.

509
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,200
Excuse me. Thank you.

510
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,520
Excuse me.

511
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,760
Here you go, Ms. Xia.

512
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,440
-It's enough.
-Tou Tou.

513
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,120
-What's wrong?
-Have you taken your lunch?

514
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,517
There are too many people. I'll not eat.

515
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,796
This won't do.

516
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,800
You'll be exhausted
after treating the patients.

517
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,800
There is another box.

518
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,640
Slowly.

519
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:15,880
Zhu Xia.

520
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,080
Well...

521
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,597
How much stock of dried ginger, Cinnamon
Twig and Chinese aconite do we have?

522
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,913
We haven't got the courier package yet?

523
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,397
We still have enough Chinese aconite.

524
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,917
But we don't have much stock left

525
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,957
for dried China root and Cinnamon Twigs.

526
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,437
You saw it too. Look.

527
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,440
Lately, we've had lots of prescriptions.

528
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,360
It'll take some time
for the courier package to get here.

529
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,837
And the pharma companies can only start

530
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,520
their shipment on
the 15th day of the lunar month.

531
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,760
This is how it is after New Year.

532
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,120
Next up is the flu.

533
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,640
It's about to change seasons, right?

534
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,320
Don't let Jian Xi
come here these few days.

535
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,720
Look, there are so many people.

536
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,760
You're right.

537
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,840
-Here you go. Take a look.
-This...

538
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,360
These are appointments
for the afternoon?

539
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,597
That's a lot!

540
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,320
We won't be able
to complete it by the evening.

541
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,077
That's all,
we can't take in any patients.

542
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,200
Okay, okay.

543
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,760
Ms. Xia.

544
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,760
Okay.

545
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,240
Jian Xi is alone at home?

546
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,077
Well, Le Le is on winter vacation.

547
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,277
So, I sent her to
Cheng Ying's house in the morning.

548
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,920
The two kids can look after each other.

549
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,437
That's good.

550
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,240
That way, Cheng Ying
and you will be relieved.

551
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,160
That's right.

552
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,160
By the way, Ms. Xia.

553
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,597
Tomorrow, can we cook some

554
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,997
tangerine peel with hawthorn tea

555
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,080
and put it at the reception?

556
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,080
Many patients have had
gastro issues lately.

557
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,037
Okay.

558
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,397
Alright, thanks a lot.

559
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,360
-Don't worry.
-Thanks.

560
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,040
-Ms. Xia.
-Okay.

561
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,000
Please check it.

562
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:43,597
Here you go.

563
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,480
The list?

564
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,480
Come.

565
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,237
Patients with an appointment,

566
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,640
please come here and get your number.

567
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,840
Wait!

568
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,757
Tell me your name.

569
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,000
-Shao Hong!
-Ke Hua!

570
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:55,960
Shao Hong!

571
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,677
Li with the words "mu" and "zi".
Li with the words "mu" and "zi".

572
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,876
I don't have your name here.

573
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,960
I did.

574
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,477
I didn't manage
to register this morning.

575
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,637
So, I came early in the afternoon.

576
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,680
I have to pick up my grandson
later for his after-school class.

577
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,120
Please give me a number.

578
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,997
Lately, I've had chest tightness.

579
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,480
I want Prof. Ren to have a look.

580
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,160
Did you eat
your hearts out during New Year?

581
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,317
My children only come back once a year.

582
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,400
So, I will prepare
a lot of delicious food.

583
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,277
And I will taste it while cooking.

584
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,477
Well, you don't need
my master to check you.

585
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,680
I can do that.

586
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,800
Yours is karma.

587
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,877
That is to say,
you killed a lot, so you're cursed.

588
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,200
Don't talk nonsense. What karma?

589
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,800
Don't listen to her.

590
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,480
She hasn't even figured out
the basics of TCM.

591
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,677
Didn't you tell Granny Jiang
that it's karma?

592
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,837
Why is it nonsense when I say it?

593
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,240
It's the same situation.

594
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,357
I know about it, so I dared to say.

595
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,640
You don't know anything,
so don't talk nonsense.

596
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,557
You cannot learn something

597
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,157
by imitating something without
understanding the substance.

598
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,160
You're blindly imitating.

599
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,637
Don't be anxious.

600
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,477
Please line up.

601
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,600
Everyone will get to see us.

602
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,997
-Tell me your name.
-Okay.

603
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:58,880
Thank you.

604
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,200
You still have to make an appointment.

605
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,838
We'll see you after the appointment.
I don't have your name here.

606
00:27:02,906 --> 00:27:04,262
-Just give me a number.
-No.

607
00:27:04,346 --> 00:27:05,223
Shao Hong.

608
00:27:05,307 --> 00:27:06,747
-Li Xia.
-Shao Hong.

609
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,880
Excuse me.

610
00:27:10,366 --> 00:27:11,317
Excuse me.

611
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,360
Add a number for me.

612
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,197
Add a number for me.

613
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,278
I can't do that. It's full today.
You have to make an appointment.

614
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,915
Dear, I can't take it anymore.

615
00:27:17,999 --> 00:27:19,039
Where is the emergency room?

616
00:27:19,123 --> 00:27:20,036
Go... Go and register.

617
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,520
No, this is an emergency.

618
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,800
What are you doing?

619
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:23,960
No, no!

620
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,360
Move back!

621
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,000
Stop it!

622
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,757
I'll buy all your numbers. Come on.

623
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,840
Why do you want to buy the numbers?

624
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,718
Go line up!
Go line up!

625
00:27:33,801 --> 00:27:34,920
Go line up!

626
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:54,960
Troublesome!

627
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,720
Tou Tou...

628
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,836
What happened?

629
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,480
She's good for only two days.

630
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,037
I just praised her two days ago

631
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,480
but she caused trouble today.

632
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,877
She didn't cause it.

633
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,880
Things pissed her off.

634
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,840
Let's just listen
how she is going to settle things.

635
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,440
This is a medical center,

636
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,640
not a wet market.

637
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,560
This is the place
you come to treat illness,

638
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,720
not the place to buy groceries.

639
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,640
Speaking of which,
all of you are patients.

640
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,160
But your voices

641
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,000
get louder and louder!

642
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,080
Your energy

643
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,760
get stronger and stronger!

644
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,160
Are you sick?

645
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,360
Are you sick?

646
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,720
Who is sick?

647
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,080
Me!

648
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,440
He jumped in line, that's why we argued.

649
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,640
That's right.

650
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,597
Are you comparable to me?

651
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,157
I am Prof. Ren's friend.

652
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,237
We are family friends.

653
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,480
You can't compare with me.

654
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,600
Am I right?

655
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,280
Do you have a ulcer again?

656
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,360
This time, what did you eat?

657
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,997
What are you talking about, dear?

658
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,320
What can I eat?

659
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,040
Just some gamey.

660
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,477
Among the patients,

661
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,360
the last one I want to see is you.

662
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,517
Don't be like that.

663
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,480
Do you know why?

664
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,640
That's because you're covered in germs.

665
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,037
I'm afraid you'll infect me.

666
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:29,960
Can you please leave?

667
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,477
But I am patient.

668
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,480
I am friends with Prof. Ren

669
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,880
Who is your friend?

670
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,800
My master doesn't have such a friend.

671
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,400
Don't tell others about this.
It's so embarrassing.

672
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,360
Let me tell you. My master

673
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,797
is kind-hearted

674
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,040
and he doesn't harm humans or animals.

675
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,277
Even he has to prescribe

676
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,917
medicine with animals,
he doesn't dare to give much.

677
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,757
-That's right.
-Can he be the same as you?

678
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,837
Can he be your friend?

679
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,477
Can he be friends with someone

680
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,757
who takes on lives and kills animals?

681
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,200
-You...
-Madam.

682
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,200
Yours is not karma.

683
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,480
Yours is karma.

684
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,160
The animals that you have eaten...

685
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,200
They turned into hatred

686
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,400
and follow you every day.

687
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:06,437
Every day, their spirits
in heaven are looking at you.

688
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,037
They'll make you vomit on what you eat.

689
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,837
They'll make you get diarrhea
on what you drink.

690
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,720
Let me tell you.

691
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,717
For this illness of yours,

692
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,000
if you don't take care of your mouth,

693
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,277
even the gods can't save you,
not to mention my master.

694
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,120
-That's right.
-What?

695
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,320
You want me
to lecture you as well, right?

696
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,480
Avoid eating certain foods,

697
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,560
quit drinking
and your daily routine.

698
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,957
Did you do any of it?

699
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,440
Look at your face.

700
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,357
Look at your face.

701
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,240
You...

702
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,520
What's the use of coming here every day?

703
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,680
Are your parents here?

704
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,080
This is bad.

705
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,120
What are you doing?

706
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,400
Just do your work.

707
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,437
Only Tou Tou dares
to teach them a lesson.

708
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,320
I dare not do that.

709
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,960
Your daughter is coughing again, right?

710
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,157
The last time
when you looked at your phone,

711
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,360
your daughter fell into the water.

712
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,040
Coughing is the root cause of it.

713
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,160
You always post the videos of
playing mahjong on your social media.

714
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,080
If you don't take care
of your own child,

715
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,600
who is going
to take care of her for you?

716
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,120
God has been gracious to you

717
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,080
that He didn't take
your child away on that time.

718
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,360
Yet you're not repenting!

719
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,840
You come here again.

720
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,240
Brother, is it so difficult
to go to bed early?

721
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,677
Is it so hard not to stay up late?

722
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,920
And you, uncle.

723
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,157
You quarrel every day.

724
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,197
Look how angry you are.

725
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,160
And you, sister.

726
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,557
You're petty-minded

727
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,920
and want to
take advantage of everything.

728
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,160
You wanted to cut in line
to see a doctor.

729
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,437
And you even used
your grandson as an excuse.

730
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,320
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

731
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,160
This is your health.

732
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,637
If you don't want
to take care of your health,

733
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,120
no one can help you.

734
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,120
It's not that
we don't want to treat you,

735
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,760
no one can cure you.

736
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,280
We've advised you

737
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,400
and prescribed medicine for you.

738
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,600
But you just don't want to listen to us.

739
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,400
You come here every day,

740
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,440
in many, many trips.

741
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,560
You keep coming here.

742
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,877
And you chatter like a fly!

743
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,240
Like a fly.

744
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,200
You guys...

745
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,080
Stay here and wait quietly.

746
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,400
Whoever makes noise again,

747
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,400
please leave.

748
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,320
You don't have to be treated.

749
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,637
I agree!

750
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,117
What do you agree with?

751
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,597
-I...
-Did you have an appointment?

752
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,837
Did you register?

753
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,077
No, that's why I'm looking for you.

754
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,000
Wait there!

755
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,160
Okay.

756
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,400
She's ferocious.

757
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,520
I think

758
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,477
we can hand medicine center

759
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,157
over to Tou Tou in the future.

760
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,040
Ward off the townspeople.

761
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,480
You said that

762
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,600
as doctors, we can't pick our patients.

763
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,200
But look at her.

764
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,760
She chose the patients she likes.

765
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,280
Someone like her can't be a doctor.

766
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,400
I think there are two types of doctors.

767
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,197
One is the evil type.

768
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,960
The other one is the benevolent type.

769
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,120
Tou Tou is suitable to be the evil type.

770
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,397
I think that for some patients,

771
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,840
we can't always spoil them.

772
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,840
We can't be always kind to them.

773
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:21,880
We should scold them

774
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,800
at the right time.

775
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,037
Tou Tou scolded

776
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,240
those we wanted to scold

777
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,520
but dare not to scold for many years.

778
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,920
That's because
we can't let ourselves down.

779
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,720
You...

780
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,600
You don't want
to be kind-hearted anymore?

781
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,037
After Tou Tou scolded them,

782
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,080
we will be the kind-hearted ones.

783
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,680
Gosh, you're vicious.

784
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,040
You're here.

785
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,360
This time, what did you eat?

786
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,280
Well, during New Year,

787
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,160
I had some gamey.

788
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:13,880
I didn't hold myself back.

789
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,080
Well, it's the cold weather.

790
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,600
So, I ate ginseng to keep warmth.

791
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,440
Then, I became like this.

792
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,117
Your life is hanging by a thread

793
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,040
yet you dare to do this.

794
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,597
Can't you be an ordinary man

795
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,920
who eats radish and cabbage?

796
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:30,920
That's not it.

797
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,317
Look.

798
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,200
We only live our lives
for a few decades.

799
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,677
If I can't eat whatever I want

800
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,157
and drink whatever I want,

801
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,600
what's the point of living then?

802
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,920
This adult world is very tough already.

803
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:44,960
Look at me.

804
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,360
I don't gamble

805
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,400
and I do not go to prostitutes.

806
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,320
I just like to eat delicious food.

807
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,077
If I really do like you say,

808
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,720
which is avoid eating this and that,

809
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,080
and live unhappily

810
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,440
until the age of 120,

811
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,440
what's the point of it?

812
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,920
It hurts, right?

813
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,080
You feel the pain, don't you?

814
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,200
You said this before.

815
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,280
We must keep being happy.

816
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,237
I ate hot food

817
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,760
after I had cold food.

818
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,160
I was happy when I was eating.

819
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,920
After eating, my heart was at peace.

820
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,040
I'm in pain now,

821
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,800
but my mind is healthy.

822
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,040
Didn't you say that

823
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,240
we should have a healthy body and mind?

824
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,800
What matters most

825
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,080
is the mind.

826
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,200
Your mind isn't healthy.

827
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,837
God has arranged
so much delicious food for us.

828
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,720
But you don't eat them.

829
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,600
You prefer to eat that other food.

830
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,880
You have an unhealthy body and mind.

831
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,760
I have you.

832
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,837
You are my greatest strength.

833
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,240
Stop talking nonsense.

834
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,440
My master won't
take the blame for your bad deeds.

835
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,877
This is not a bad deed.

836
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,277
Mr. Ren, he ate a lot of gamey

837
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,277
which he shouldn't be eaten.

838
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,560
He didn't listen to you either.

839
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,680
And you can't control him.
Just forget about it.

840
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,600
How about we call the police?

841
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,360
But just like what she said,

842
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,597
we should call the police.

843
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,480
That's right.

844
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,080
No, no. Stop fooling around.

845
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,440
Look at this girl.

846
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,080
Dr. Ren.

847
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,560
Among your apprentices, she's the one

848
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,837
who has delicate features.

849
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:21,040
You have a hot temper
and you're powerful.

850
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,317
She and you are like Ying and Yang,

851
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,158
a very good combination.
Very good combination.

852
00:36:25,241 --> 00:36:26,197
Stop talking nonsense.

853
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,000
She's not my apprentice.

854
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,360
She is my master.

855
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,880
She came to change me.

856
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:06,840
Roubecca.

857
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,280
This is Zhu Chang Ming's prescription.

858
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,760
Put it over there.
I'll prepare it later.

859
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,280
Okay.

860
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,676
I noticed that
you didn't sign up for the class

861
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,357
on picking herbs from the mountains.
Why is that?

862
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,440
Aren't you a top student?
You're always proactive.

863
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,760
I'm a little curious.

864
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,920
Being a top student alone is not enough.

865
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,720
I need to be a "top mother".

866
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:30,960
What do you mean?

867
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,400
This time,

868
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,000
you learn well on my behalf.

869
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,717
I have to complete

870
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,040
the most important event in my life.

871
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,717
Moreover, if all of you go to the class,

872
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,840
I need to take care of
the medical center as it's busy.

873
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,360
Let me prepare the herbs on your behalf.

874
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,080
-It's alright.
-I'm late!

875
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,317
Zhao Li Quan, what time is it now?

876
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,040
There were many patients in the morning.

877
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,600
I'm sorry.

878
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,360
Xing Xing had a fever last night.

879
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,717
I came here
after I made the medicine for her

880
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,120
and gave her a simple massage.

881
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,280
She's having a fever? Why?

882
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,960
I guess she's tired.

883
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,800
The hospital also
has its busiest time now.

884
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,080
Let me go and change my clothes first.

885
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,400
Please apply for leave for me.

886
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,600
Apply for leave?

887
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,400
You come and see it three times a day.
What have you got?

888
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,840
It usually looks good,
with lots of leaves.

889
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:42,600
Yet you pruned it.

890
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,120
You even built a warm house for it.

891
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,440
The tomato

892
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,800
is dead now.

893
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,040
I had good intentions,
but I guess it's too much for it.

894
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,840
I don't want this to happen either.

895
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,320
Are you still feeling not well?

896
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:22,960
No.

897
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,560
I feel better after taking the medicine.

898
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,757
Zhao Li Quan said

899
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,920
you drank the Chinese medicine he made.

900
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,077
I had taken the cold medicine

901
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,000
but he insisted on
making the medicine for me.

902
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,040
Your pulse looks fine.

903
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,400
As long as the fever has subsided.

904
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,720
Have a rest. I'll get you some water.

905
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,440
Oh right, Xing Xing.

906
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,720
When you're free,

907
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,040
please sell my comics on my behalf.

908
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,117
I'm not reading them anymore.

909
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,360
And I can get some money from it.

910
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:52,880
Alright.

911
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,240
It's hot, be careful.

912
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,320
Blow it.

913
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,520
Zhao Li Quan and you live together.

914
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,320
Don't you have any sparks?

915
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,240
He is a TCM practitioner
while I'm a doctor.

916
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,480
What's wrong with that?

917
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,760
Well, it's not associated.

918
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,000
What are you talking about?

919
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,797
One is the doctor
for traditional Chinese medicine

920
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,957
while the other one
is a nurse for Western medicine.

921
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,117
It's a perfect couple.

922
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,640
How could you say it's not associated?

923
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:21,920
What a match!

924
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,600
Don't you think that

925
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,320
two is better than one?

926
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,240
For example, you're sick today

927
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,800
and he could prepare medicine for you.

928
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,520
What would have happened to you
if I had not come back in time?

929
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,440
Well, actually...

930
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,200
Occasionally

931
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,440
I do feel

932
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,280
something.

933
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,880
When the two of us

934
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,360
resting at home,

935
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,960
we talk and eat together.

936
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,280
When I come home late
from the night shift,

937
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,197
he waits for me at the small alley.

938
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,560
I feel warmth, actually.

939
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,640
But each time I have this thought,

940
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,960
I will pull myself back.

941
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,980
I

942
00:41:08,006 --> 00:41:09,040
cannot...

943
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,640
I cannot choose him.

944
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:17,917
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

945
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,317
(are referenced from relevant
traditional Chinese medicine books)

946
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,720
