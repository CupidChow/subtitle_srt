1
00:00:05,753 --> 00:00:06,553
Come.

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:07,919
Give me a smile.

3
00:00:08,371 --> 00:00:09,487
Go away!

4
00:00:09,959 --> 00:00:10,880
Xiao Hong.

5
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:12,738
Peng doesn't have a grudge against you.

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,145
Why must you pick on each other
whenever you meet?

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,077
If you're free,

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,920
go and help at the pharmacy.

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,480
Besides, you're here all the time.

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,560
I guess they'll fire you.

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,439
If that's the case, you support me then.

12
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,000
Why are you here again?

13
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,517
You've been here more often than

14
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,760
when you were
pretending to attend classes.

15
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,479
What's wrong with you?
Were you laid off?

16
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,240
Laid off my foot!

17
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:41,799
Xiao Hong, here.

18
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,360
I'm not drinking.

19
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:44,720
Drink it.

20
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:45,960
I'm not drinking.

21
00:00:46,199 --> 00:00:46,999
Peng.

22
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,080
Peng.

23
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,440
Bring it over since she doesn't want it.

24
00:00:49,639 --> 00:00:50,439
Bring it here.

25
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:51,599
Bring it here.

26
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,760
Coming!

27
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,556
That's the way. We'll drink, you know.

28
00:00:58,639 --> 00:00:59,920
Come, Ms. Xia.

29
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:01,560
I'll open it for you.

30
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,600
Tell me.

31
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,439
Is there something wrong
with the feng shui in my house?

32
00:01:19,399 --> 00:01:20,839
First, it was Zhu.

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,479
Then, followed by me.

34
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:25,799
Could it be that

35
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,439
God

36
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,799
wants to take us all away this year?

37
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,600
It is normal to be sick.

38
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,240
Who doesn't get sick?

39
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:40,479
Besides, cancer

40
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,079
is not an incurable disease.

41
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,759
It is a chronic disease.

42
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:48,519
I love what you say.

43
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:52,199
I think it is a chronic disease.

44
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,119
I'll slowly treat it

45
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,996
with Chinese medicine,

46
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,960
take the Chinese medicine
and acupuncture.

47
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:09,079
But

48
00:02:09,279 --> 00:02:11,680
the doctors want me to have a surgery

49
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,996
to remove my uterus and ovaries.

50
00:02:15,079 --> 00:02:16,836
They said I'm already at this age,

51
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:17,916
so I don't need to use them anymore.

52
00:02:17,999 --> 00:02:19,559
How could they say that?

53
00:02:19,799 --> 00:02:20,836
Once the uterus is removed,

54
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:22,436
I'll not have estrogen.

55
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:24,276
Then, I'll become
an old woman in no time.

56
00:02:24,359 --> 00:02:25,719
I don't want to get operated.

57
00:02:28,279 --> 00:02:30,880
Prof. Ren, I trust you.

58
00:02:31,799 --> 00:02:33,519
I choose to get the treatment here.

59
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,439
Can you please keep my uterus?

60
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:40,439
It is correct for the doctor
to ask you to have surgery.

61
00:02:41,359 --> 00:02:42,716
What's the point of saving the uterus

62
00:02:42,799 --> 00:02:44,519
in your current situation?

63
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,639
Prof. Ren, how could you say that?

64
00:02:49,999 --> 00:02:51,799
You taught us before.

65
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:52,916
You said that

66
00:02:52,999 --> 00:02:55,276
every organ in our body is precious.

67
00:02:55,359 --> 00:02:58,359
If it is removed,
we can never replace it.

68
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:00,916
And you said that

69
00:03:00,999 --> 00:03:02,999
we should consider carefully
about getting surgery.

70
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:05,559
Why are you talking like this today?

71
00:03:07,359 --> 00:03:09,037
When Zhu passed away,

72
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,279
he entrusted our whole family to you.

73
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,836
I even donated
a big sum of money to the center.

74
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:14,877
How could you leave and

75
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,200
ignore me after receiving the money?

76
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:17,319
That...

77
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,000
That's not right.

78
00:03:22,359 --> 00:03:25,519
I know you're not that kind of person.

79
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:28,439
Tell me the truth.

80
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:30,719
Do you think I'm hopeless?

81
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:32,757
I can take it.

82
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,476
I'm taking the pulse right now.

83
00:03:34,559 --> 00:03:36,359
Please don't talk to me, okay?

84
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,916
I see that you can be saved,

85
00:03:45,999 --> 00:03:48,799
that's why I hope you can
get the surgery at the hospital.

86
00:03:50,279 --> 00:03:51,799
Do you know what kind of person

87
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:54,079
is suitable for Chinese medicine?

88
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,720
Little monkey.

89
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,005
Come, let's take the medicine.

90
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:05,759
Thanks.

91
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,600
You're also a fan of Liu?

92
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,520
That's right! I like him!

93
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,916
He's handsome and funny.

94
00:04:18,999 --> 00:04:20,036
When he is dancing,

95
00:04:20,119 --> 00:04:21,437
he is like another person.

96
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,399
I'm falling for him!

97
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,356
Are you his die-hard fan too?

98
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:27,717
I just followed Tou Tou's request,

99
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,399
to vote for him and watch his videos.

100
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,916
I'm not his die-hard fan.

101
00:04:30,999 --> 00:04:32,800
But I like him though.

102
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:36,119
So, you're doing it for Tou Tou.

103
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:39,119
She made us all vote for Liu.

104
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,959
Yes, including us, the patients.

105
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:43,316
Who is it? Who does Tou like?

106
00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:44,239
My idol.

107
00:04:47,239 --> 00:04:48,520
Isn't he Mr. Liu's son?

108
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:50,244
The kid who likes to sing and dance

109
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,039
-but doesn't like studying.
-That's right.

110
00:04:52,136 --> 00:04:55,876
He has become very popular after
participating in the street dance show.

111
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:58,277
In the past few weeks, the number of
his votes has been in the top three.

112
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,316
And he also told us that

113
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:01,596
if he can't win the competition,

114
00:05:01,679 --> 00:05:03,040
he'll return home
and inherit the family business.

115
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:05,360
We are all doing our best
so that he can win.

116
00:05:05,679 --> 00:05:07,640
You guys too, are my treasure boy's

117
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:08,805
fans?

118
00:05:08,888 --> 00:05:11,719
I know him.
He's a big fan of our center.

119
00:05:12,239 --> 00:05:13,959
Peng, you're wrong.

120
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:16,876
He's not a fan of our center.

121
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:18,520
He's a fan of Tou Tou.

122
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,036
This is my first time
being so close to my idol.

123
00:05:23,119 --> 00:05:23,916
No wonder he said

124
00:05:23,999 --> 00:05:25,760
his fans are called "saffron".

125
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:27,480
He is so knowledgeable.

126
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,959
Knowing a saffron
consider as knowledgeable?

127
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:31,596
So, those of us who know
Classic of the Materia Medica

128
00:05:31,679 --> 00:05:33,239
since we're young is known as what?

129
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,439
Don't interrupt.

130
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:38,677
The girl that
Zi Hong the Treasure Boy likes,

131
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,997
what's her name again?

132
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,920
I'll post breaking news later.

133
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:44,480
Don't talk nonsense.

134
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:46,279
Tou Tou will not
like such a shallow person.

135
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,999
You're the shallow one, and lonely!

136
00:05:49,119 --> 00:05:51,520
Tian Zhen, have you read
the trending topics?

137
00:05:51,719 --> 00:05:52,519
Trending topics?

138
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,160
Look.

139
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,000
What's wrong?

140
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:00,480
Quickly go and
read the trending topics.

141
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:02,399
What's trending, Rebecca?

142
00:06:02,719 --> 00:06:03,800
See for yourself.

143
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,399
-Show me.
-Here.

144
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,717
I am a TCM practitioner.

145
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,196
But I respect
Western medicine very much.

146
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:19,239
Western medicine
is an amazing discipline.

147
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:21,279
If you have a headache or slight fever,

148
00:06:21,719 --> 00:06:23,559
don't go to the hospital
and stand in line.

149
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:25,839
Come to me and I'll nurse your body.

150
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,916
If you're terminally ill

151
00:06:28,999 --> 00:06:30,196
and the Western medicine
does not accept you anymore,

152
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:31,959
don't waste the money.

153
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:34,200
Chinese medicine
is responsible for your old age.

154
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:36,520
So, I hope you

155
00:06:37,119 --> 00:06:38,920
can go to the hospital for the surgery.

156
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:40,437
Your current condition

157
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,399
is where the Western medicine
is at its best.

158
00:06:42,999 --> 00:06:43,880
So, why shouldn't you go?

159
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,999
I'm in what stage now?

160
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,080
Well, it's like this.

161
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,959
Cancer... The cancer cell

162
00:06:55,559 --> 00:06:58,200
is like a car on the highway

163
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:00,159
and is being chased by the police.

164
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:02,439
How can the police catch up?

165
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:05,880
There must be a checkpoint
on the highway.

166
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:10,839
The surgery from Western medicine
is to set a checkpoint for you

167
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:13,520
so that you can catch it.

168
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:17,639
How about this?

169
00:07:18,999 --> 00:07:20,596
After your surgery,

170
00:07:20,679 --> 00:07:22,399
I'll be in charge
of cleaning up for you.

171
00:07:24,119 --> 00:07:26,839
So, for my condition,
how long will it take to clean it up?

172
00:07:27,119 --> 00:07:29,880
Think about this.
You've had the bad living habits

173
00:07:30,679 --> 00:07:31,959
for so long.

174
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,200
So, to clean up

175
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:36,360
requires a long time.

176
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,200
So, according to you,

177
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:43,559
I still can live for many years?

178
00:07:44,119 --> 00:07:45,439
I took your pulse.

179
00:07:45,679 --> 00:07:47,600
Yours is the longevity pulse.
No problem.

180
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:48,959
No way.

181
00:07:49,239 --> 00:07:51,480
I have cancer, how can I live long?

182
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:54,520
Prof. Ren, you're
not trying to comfort me, are you?

183
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,239
There are people
with cancer who live a longer life.

184
00:07:57,719 --> 00:07:59,559
Those who live until 100 years old
without any diseases and calamities,

185
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,320
they have the fate of the gods.

186
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,520
You and I are mortal

187
00:08:03,999 --> 00:08:05,520
who eat whole grains.

188
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:07,080
We'll surely fall sick.

189
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,437
I don't understand now.

190
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,839
Do you want to die or live?

191
00:08:14,679 --> 00:08:16,600
If you really miss...

192
00:08:16,838 --> 00:08:19,091
If you miss Zhu...
Well...

193
00:08:19,175 --> 00:08:21,117
I...
No, I don't miss him.

194
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,399
I want to live.

195
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,997
That's why I suggested you to do this.

196
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,957
It's not
because Zhu entrusted you to me.

197
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,720
It's also not because
you donated money to the center.

198
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,117
It's because of me,

199
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,520
as a doctor with a conscience.

200
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,400
I will entrust you
to a very good friend of mine.

201
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,160
He is the best in the country

202
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,280
in this field.

203
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:55,320
When he completes the surgery,

204
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,760
come to me again.

205
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,479
What if...

206
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:02,960
What if the surgery fails?

207
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,200
You said "what if".

208
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,437
That means, it may or may not happen.

209
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,640
Why do you think it may happen to you?

210
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,080
Go now.

211
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,640
You must believe in science.

212
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,039
You said we shouldn't believe in science.

213
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,317
You said science

214
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,836
isn't the only ruler in this world.

215
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:25,559
I listened carefully
to that lecture video of yours.

216
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,637
What I meant was,
don't be superstitious.

217
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,559
Don't be superstitious about anything.

218
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,200
You must have the right belief.

219
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:36,876
(Trending Topics. 1. Meng Meng day)
(2. Penalties on Zhang Jia Nan)

220
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,960
Fired. He should be fired.

221
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,239
This kind of person should not be alive.

222
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,716
And they reported his real name.

223
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:43,880
Even the Ministry of Education
has given the statement.

224
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,479
He's doomed for sure.

225
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,200
He is a scum. He deserved this.

226
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,760
Well done.
He should be embarrassed publicly.

227
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,119
Too bad about the girl.

228
00:10:32,478 --> 00:10:35,518
(The beginning of winter means
the beginning of the storage of energy.)

229
00:10:36,038 --> 00:10:38,718
(Everything enters
a state of rest and recuperation.)

230
00:10:39,078 --> 00:10:41,678
(It is a time to enjoy the harvest

231
00:10:42,478 --> 00:10:47,238
and to rest and recuperate.)

232
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,959
(The beginning of winter)

233
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:11,839
Mom.

234
00:11:12,479 --> 00:11:14,080
I've applied for a leave.
I'm going to the hospital.

235
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,760
You're just in time.

236
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,720
Bring along these sachets.

237
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,557
Let Tou Tou, Xing Xing

238
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,160
and Shen Xin keep this with them.

239
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,396
You can give it to anyone who needs it.

240
00:11:26,479 --> 00:11:27,877
Well, the flu season coming, you know.

241
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,117
Okay, no problem.

242
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,080
And...

243
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,280
Tell Tou Tou
not to do acupuncture first.

244
00:11:33,599 --> 00:11:35,960
Your dad and I will go at noon.
We'll have lunch together.

245
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,237
After your dad has checked on him,

246
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,117
we'll decide on the next treatment plan.

247
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,160
Alright, Mom. Leave it to me.

248
00:12:09,439 --> 00:12:11,119
You're still here.

249
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,640
Put this on.

250
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,720
My mom said my dad is coming at noon.

251
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:18,320
He may want
to adjust the treatment plan.

252
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,237
Let me tell you.

253
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,317
His reaction
to the needle is getting better.

254
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,117
When the doctor came
to check on him this morning,

255
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,799
there was a response
when he touched his feet.

256
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:29,960
Really?

257
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,440
That's very good.

258
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:36,156
Don't hang things in the ward.

259
00:12:36,239 --> 00:12:37,039
It's not allowed.

260
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,120
Okay.

261
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,640
Let me tell you.

262
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,280
I want to give the uncle
next door acupuncture too.

263
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,117
His wife has begged me for days.

264
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,320
Don't mess around.

265
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,640
You do the acupuncture on Senior Uncle

266
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,960
under the guidance of my dad.

267
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,320
You can't take matters
into your own hands.

268
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,599
One more year.

269
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,720
I'll be able to catch up
with you in a year.

270
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,757
You're finally going to be on my level.

271
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,840
No.

272
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,877
According to our seniority,
I'm still your senior.

273
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,317
You have to call me "grandpa".

274
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,877
Tou Tou, I'm going back now.

275
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,116
If there's anything,
you can call the nurse.

276
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,237
Thanks a lot.

277
00:13:17,306 --> 00:13:18,546
Thank you. Be careful.

278
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,757
Grandpa, let me
tell you something great.

279
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,956
Do you want to know about it?

280
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:30,080
Zhang Jia Nan

281
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,080
is on trending topics.
I know about it.

282
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,760
Did you

283
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,520
take good care of Senior Uncle here?

284
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,396
Is there anything out there
that you don't know?

285
00:13:38,479 --> 00:13:40,437
I want to take good care of him.

286
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,919
But look at him now.

287
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,520
What else can I do?

288
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,479
I should've let Zhu Xia and
Jian Xi to come and visit him.

289
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,840
It's a blessing

290
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,760
to be able to take care of them.

291
00:13:56,733 --> 00:13:57,933
This is what I'm most afraid of

292
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,760
Let's go out for a walk.

293
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,440
Let's go.

294
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,080
Let's go.

295
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:36,997
Shouldn't we go out for a walk?

296
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,520
Why are you playing on your phone?

297
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,239
This is what I meant.

298
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,877
Senior Uncle won't wake up for a while.

299
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,280
We'll just have a stroll
for a few minutes.

300
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,559
I have to keep close to him.

301
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,679
Do you have to go that far?

302
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,359
That's what your dad said.

303
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,317
My dad isn't here.

304
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,679
No one will know
if we go out for a few minutes.

305
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:02,438
(Senior Uncle has woken up! Thank God!)

306
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,239
Senior Uncle has woken up?

307
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,960
Tou Tou, what does this mean?

308
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,880
I'd like to deceive Zhao Li Quan.

309
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,320
Li Quan?

310
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,760
What's with him?

311
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,200
I think he had something to do
with what happened to Senior Uncle.

312
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,840
How is he related to this?

313
00:15:24,599 --> 00:15:26,080
Every time Zhao Li Quan
comes and visits him,

314
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,080
his blood pressure will go up.

315
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,317
But his pressure isn't that high
when Granny Wu and Ms. Shen visit him.

316
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,520
Don't you think it's strange?

317
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,757
Senior Uncle likes Li Quan very much.

318
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,956
So, it's normal for him
to have this reaction.

319
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:37,960
This is not normal.

320
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,679
I don't think this is a normal reaction.

321
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,919
Don't speculate about things
you don't have proof of.

322
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,520
It's my intuition.

323
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:51,080
The Chinese medicine's intuition.

324
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,200
My intuition is wrong.

325
00:16:12,599 --> 00:16:13,399
What now?

326
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,877
I thought the first person
to reply or feel happy

327
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,880
should be Zhao Li Quan.

328
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,520
But he didn't respond at all.

329
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,599
Sometimes intuition is inaccurate.

330
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,840
Hello, Ling Lan.

331
00:16:35,999 --> 00:16:39,320
Someone sent a huge bouquet and a cake.

332
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:41,280
Did you order these?

333
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,396
(They've arrived?)

334
00:16:43,479 --> 00:16:45,880
Did the flowers
and the cake come together?

335
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,840
Look at you.

336
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,117
Your dad can't eat sweet food now.

337
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,797
I must let him control his sugar intake.

338
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,720
(Don't you want him to live?)

339
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,437
Mom, today is my big day.

340
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,039
What big day for you?

341
00:17:01,599 --> 00:17:03,557
Today is me and Xin Zheng's

342
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,760
30th wedding anniversary.

343
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,119
Oh, my God!

344
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:15,800
Look. I've been thinking
about Shan Dao's issue

345
00:17:15,999 --> 00:17:18,599
that I forgot such an important thing.

346
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,276
(Yes, we should celebrate this.)

347
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,159
It's alright.

348
00:17:22,999 --> 00:17:25,636
The cake I ordered
is a sugar-free tofu cake.

349
00:17:25,719 --> 00:17:26,760
(Dad can eat.)

350
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,560
I see.

351
00:17:29,999 --> 00:17:30,916
Gosh, what should I do?

352
00:17:30,999 --> 00:17:33,520
There're no ingredients at home.

353
00:17:33,959 --> 00:17:36,199
It's okay. I'll order some online.

354
00:17:37,239 --> 00:17:38,039
No need for that.

355
00:17:38,479 --> 00:17:40,599
I told Zhu Xia to go over and cook.

356
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,440
She cooks very well.

357
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:45,560
Well, I mainly
want to give her some money.

358
00:17:45,959 --> 00:17:46,880
Alright.

359
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:50,319
But Zhu Xia will not take your money.

360
00:17:50,959 --> 00:17:52,036
But this is different.

361
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:53,119
This is a happy occasion.

362
00:17:53,479 --> 00:17:55,319
We must share happiness.

363
00:17:56,959 --> 00:17:58,876
But I can't give her the money.

364
00:17:58,959 --> 00:17:59,880
(You give her.)

365
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:02,036
(I've prepared the red packet.)

366
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:04,760
(It's on
the dressing table in your room.)

367
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:07,079
If you give it to her, she will take it.

368
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:09,359
Alright.

369
00:18:11,959 --> 00:18:14,119
My dear daughter, look at you.

370
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,119
You're thoughtful

371
00:18:16,479 --> 00:18:18,880
in doing things now.

372
00:18:19,479 --> 00:18:22,396
(Be it the household or the center,)

373
00:18:22,479 --> 00:18:24,800
you arranged well.

374
00:18:24,999 --> 00:18:26,800
I'm happy for you.

375
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:32,719
But I want to ask you this.

376
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:34,677
Does the male protagonist

377
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,280
(remember this special day?)

378
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:41,119
If I'm not mistaken,

379
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:42,999
he does not remember this.

380
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:47,520
But as long as he shows up,

381
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,880
I'll consider that he has cooperated.

382
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,319
Okay.

383
00:18:51,959 --> 00:18:55,839
Well, ask Tian Zhen
and Tou Tou to come back early.

384
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,400
Tou Tou can't go home.

385
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:59,036
Her master put her on duty.

386
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:00,999
It's a big deal for her.

387
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:02,719
Just our own family.

388
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:06,159
Alright.

389
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:09,159
Goodbye.

390
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,239
My god.

391
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:26,999
My daughter
has been married for 30 years.

392
00:19:32,211 --> 00:19:35,054
(Jiangzhou People's Hospital)

393
00:19:35,719 --> 00:19:37,239
He didn't reply to the message.

394
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:38,959
Is it because he is at work?

395
00:19:39,199 --> 00:19:41,199
You really think
of yourself as Detective Conan?

396
00:19:41,479 --> 00:19:42,760
You're thinking too much.

397
00:19:43,239 --> 00:19:44,599
If Li Quan had not been there,

398
00:19:44,839 --> 00:19:46,359
Senior Uncle would have not been here.

399
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,916
Luckily, he went there early
and found out about Senior Uncle.

400
00:19:48,999 --> 00:19:50,276
If he had been late,

401
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:52,396
you would have no chance
of trying to save him.

402
00:19:52,479 --> 00:19:54,036
Senior Uncle knows about it.

403
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:55,197
Perhaps he is feeling grateful

404
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,156
and that made
his blood pressure goes up.

405
00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:58,479
That's not right.

406
00:20:00,239 --> 00:20:01,880
Zhao Li Quan lied to us.

407
00:20:01,999 --> 00:20:03,116
He went to see Senior Uncle before.

408
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,677
When he went there,
Senior Uncle was fine.

409
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,680
Someone can testify to this.

410
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,719
So, I guess that

411
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:08,839
when he went there,

412
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:11,239
Senior Uncle was alright.

413
00:20:12,239 --> 00:20:14,599
And Senior Uncle
collapsed in front of him.

414
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,719
But when I asked him, he hesitated.

415
00:20:18,839 --> 00:20:20,199
He even wanted to brush me off.

416
00:20:21,479 --> 00:20:22,359
That's the weird part.

417
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:26,876
Why didn't you tell me
such an important thing?

418
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:27,999
How long have you known this?

419
00:20:28,999 --> 00:20:29,999
I told your dad.

420
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,640
Shouldn't you tell me first?

421
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,719
Well, I should tell my master first.

422
00:20:36,959 --> 00:20:38,119
He is your master.

423
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,640
I am your husband.

424
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:42,119
The two of us are
going to live together forever.

425
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,479
How about this? Can we make a rule?

426
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,798
-Discuss important things with me first.
-No.

427
00:20:47,881 --> 00:20:49,959
I should tell my master first
about the important things.

428
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,160
In your heart,

429
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:56,396
is your husband

430
00:20:56,479 --> 00:20:57,317
or master important?

431
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,200
Master is important.

432
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,116
I'm thinking things.

433
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,276
Hey, are you sick?

434
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:09,797
Why are you jealous of your dad?

435
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,119
I'm not being jealous.

436
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,276
Jealousy is
when we do that to our competitors.

437
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:16,239
Mine is
petty love competing with great love.

438
00:21:16,719 --> 00:21:18,199
In front of Chinese medicine,

439
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,999
I am nothing.

440
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,479
You put
the position of inheritor before me.

441
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,239
You're really your mom's son.

442
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,239
Your mom fought
with your dad all her life

443
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,160
because of this issue too.

444
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,560
Quan!

445
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:47,079
Mr. Wu is awake?

446
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:49,277
How is he?

447
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,396
Did you guard at the hospital?

448
00:21:51,479 --> 00:21:52,557
How did you get here so fast?

449
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,239
I came when I saw your message.

450
00:21:55,479 --> 00:21:56,760
-Can he talk?
-Yes.

451
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,479
What did he say?

452
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:00,159
He said...

453
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,199
"Li Quan."

454
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,920
"Li Quan, he..."

455
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,479
"He..."

456
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,996
That's all. Then, he went on sleeping.

457
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:15,516
He just said that.

458
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:16,916
Mr. Wu misses me. I have to go see him.

459
00:22:16,999 --> 00:22:18,999
Zhao Li Quan!
Wait a minute! No.

460
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,760
You can't go in.

461
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:22,516
Why can't I go in?

462
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:26,036
Well, just now,
I was kicked out by the nurse.

463
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:28,119
She said I affected his rest.

464
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,317
And when he said "Li Quan",

465
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,599
his blood pressure went up.

466
00:22:32,479 --> 00:22:33,920
We don't know why.

467
00:22:41,719 --> 00:22:43,359
Quan, don't worry.

468
00:22:43,719 --> 00:22:46,156
Since Senior Uncle is awake,
he will get better soon.

469
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:47,479
You'll see him sooner or later.

470
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:49,359
Don't rush over it.

471
00:22:50,999 --> 00:22:52,760
No, I must see him.

472
00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:54,110
You can't go in.

473
00:22:55,479 --> 00:22:56,880
Master has told Chief Physician Li that

474
00:22:57,012 --> 00:22:59,252
anyone who wants to enter the ward
has to get his consent.

475
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,999
If you want to go in,
you should call and ask Master.

476
00:23:03,719 --> 00:23:05,760
Does that include
Mrs. Wu and his mother?

477
00:23:10,719 --> 00:23:11,519
Quan.

478
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:24,400
Hello, Mrs. Wu. I'm Li Quan.

479
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:26,239
Mr. Wu is awake.

480
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,920
What are you saying? Wu is awake?

481
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:31,916
Is it true?

482
00:23:31,999 --> 00:23:33,479
Tou Tou didn't tell me.

483
00:23:33,999 --> 00:23:35,276
I'll go right now.

484
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:37,119
Wait for me.
We'll go to the ward together.

485
00:23:38,199 --> 00:23:39,880
Come quickly. I'll wait for you.

486
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,440
Okay.

487
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,719
Mom, take it easy. Slow down.

488
00:23:58,880 --> 00:23:59,719
You go first.

489
00:24:03,199 --> 00:24:03,999
Tou Tou.

490
00:24:04,239 --> 00:24:05,880
Shan Dao is awake, right?

491
00:24:05,999 --> 00:24:06,636
For real?

492
00:24:06,719 --> 00:24:07,996
Ms. Shen, Grandma.

493
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:09,400
Senior Uncle is very stable now.

494
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,440
Don't worry.

495
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,760
What does that mean?

496
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,959
Is he awake or not?

497
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,320
Good girl.

498
00:24:15,959 --> 00:24:18,119
Thank you for taking care
of Shan Dao during this time.

499
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,516
Now that he is awake,

500
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:21,400
can we go in and have a look?

501
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:24,516
Senior Uncle was awake for a while.

502
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:26,680
Then, he fell asleep again.
He's sleeping soundly now.

503
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,916
If you want to visit him,

504
00:24:28,999 --> 00:24:30,520
Tou Tou will talk to the nurse.

505
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:33,876
Right now, only Tou Tou
has seen Mr. Wu awake.

506
00:24:33,959 --> 00:24:36,756
Granny Wu and Mrs. Wu
should go in and see him

507
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:37,999
so that they'll feel at ease.

508
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,276
Why are you here again?

509
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:43,640
Two at a time.
We can't let so many people go in.

510
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:45,880
I'll go in with Mrs. Wu.

511
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,400
Quan, Granny Wu is more worried.

512
00:24:48,839 --> 00:24:50,079
Let Mrs. Wu and Granny Wu go in.

513
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:51,999
What's there to look at?
It's the same every day.

514
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,400
How could it be the same?

515
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:56,396
I thought he was awake this morning?
That's why we...

516
00:24:56,479 --> 00:24:58,479
-Who said that?
-Tou Tou.

517
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:02,156
I see. Then he probably
was just awake for a while.

518
00:25:02,239 --> 00:25:04,156
I just started my shift.
I haven't had time to ask yet.

519
00:25:04,239 --> 00:25:05,039
Come.

520
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,560
Mrs. Wu.

521
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:07,639
Can you...

522
00:25:08,199 --> 00:25:09,079
Nurse.

523
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,040
Please let the three of us
go in together.

524
00:25:11,199 --> 00:25:12,276
He is Mr. Wu's student.

525
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:14,719
That's right. I sent Mr. Wu here.

526
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,280
I miss him so much.

527
00:25:20,959 --> 00:25:22,197
No, only two.

528
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,597
You two immediate family members then.

529
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,640
Please come
with me to get a change. This way.

530
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:34,516
Quan, how are you doing?

531
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:35,760
I don't see you coming
to the medical center.

532
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,400
What are you two doing?

533
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,280
You're like the fighting cocks.

534
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,677
We're all good friends.

535
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,119
Why it has to be like this?

536
00:25:52,999 --> 00:25:54,040
I'll go in first.

537
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:55,399
Go.

538
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,479
Wait a while and you can go in.

539
00:26:03,719 --> 00:26:04,677
Sit down.

540
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,560
Take a break. Don't be anxious.

541
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,680
Alright.

542
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:14,599
Don't be angry.

543
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,560
Everything will be fine.

544
00:26:51,239 --> 00:26:52,079
Ren, how is he?

545
00:26:52,999 --> 00:26:54,760
He is still weak.

546
00:26:57,119 --> 00:26:58,400
Looks like

547
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:01,239
he will have enough sleep this time.

548
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:04,760
Let him have a good rest.

549
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,999
Let's try not to disturb him.

550
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:08,760
Okay, okay.

551
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:11,119
As long as he is fine.

552
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,080
That's right.

553
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:13,920
As long as he is fine.

554
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:17,959
Shan Dao.

555
00:27:18,199 --> 00:27:19,959
You listen to me since you were a child.

556
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,760
You have never let me down.

557
00:27:23,959 --> 00:27:27,479
I believe that this time,
you will make it.

558
00:27:32,999 --> 00:27:34,199
Try harder

559
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:36,599
and have a good rest.

560
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,680
Tomorrow,

561
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,959
you can help me
do the grocery shopping again.

562
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:53,719
Thank you, Ren. Thank you.

563
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,359
Thank you.

564
00:27:56,599 --> 00:27:57,396
Tou Tou.

565
00:27:57,479 --> 00:27:58,479
Thank you

566
00:27:58,599 --> 00:27:59,640
for taking care of him

567
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:02,040
during this period.

568
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:04,880
Thank you so much.

569
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,560
Tou Tou, come here.

570
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:11,999
Let me tell you
about the treatment after this.

571
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,000
Tell me. Why did you lie?

572
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:36,280
You really know everything.

573
00:28:36,999 --> 00:28:38,479
Otherwise, how can I be your master?

574
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,440
I'm sorry.

575
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,400
Just now, you have seen Granny Wu

576
00:28:53,239 --> 00:28:54,516
and Ms. Shen's expression.

577
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:55,640
What do you have in mind?

578
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:01,039
I was wrong.

579
00:29:04,479 --> 00:29:06,599
I know you want
to deceive Zhao Li Quan.

580
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,400
You want to figure things out.

581
00:29:10,479 --> 00:29:12,276
If it's as you expected,

582
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:14,400
it's Zhao Li Quan who
wanted to harm your Senior Uncle

583
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,760
and he doesn't have a good reason,

584
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,199
can what you do right now

585
00:29:20,239 --> 00:29:21,359
wake him up?

586
00:29:24,239 --> 00:29:25,599
Granny Wu is over 80 years old.

587
00:29:26,479 --> 00:29:27,880
When you saw the look in her eyes,

588
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,999
have you thought about the consequences?

589
00:29:31,999 --> 00:29:32,880
I'm asking you.

590
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,079
I was wrong, Master.

591
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,280
That's all you'll say.

592
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:44,560
Why are you pouting?

593
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:51,760
Anyway, I know
it was Zhao Li Quan who did it.

594
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,359
And Zhao Li Quan knows that
I know that he did it.

595
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:57,839
Are you doing a tongue twister for me?

596
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,959
You said this before.

597
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:02,599
Feelings are the windows to the soul.

598
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,680
I just know it.

599
00:30:09,719 --> 00:30:10,599
Tou Tou.

600
00:30:12,239 --> 00:30:13,557
We won't let a bad guy go,

601
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,760
but we can't wrong a good man.

602
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,160
A doctor's job...

603
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,040
Your job
is to heal the sick and save the sick.

604
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:25,079
But what is your priority?

605
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:28,760
It is to ensure
the safety of the patient's life.

606
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,479
With this lie of yours,

607
00:30:32,239 --> 00:30:34,719
Chief Physician Li got off the
operating table and rushed over here.

608
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,560
He is the attending physician.

609
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,640
Can you hold on to this lie?

610
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,959
And this has directly affected
the subsequent treatment.

611
00:30:47,199 --> 00:30:47,999
Master.

612
00:30:50,359 --> 00:30:51,599
What should I do then?

613
00:30:55,599 --> 00:30:57,560
You're usually high-spirited.

614
00:30:59,119 --> 00:31:00,119
Why are you listless now?

615
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:02,996
Have I made no progress at all?

616
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:04,479
-What do you think?
-Yes, I have not.

617
00:31:08,239 --> 00:31:09,039
Tou Tou.

618
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,876
You have good intentions.

619
00:31:11,959 --> 00:31:13,916
You want to do something for Shan Dao

620
00:31:13,999 --> 00:31:15,479
and you're doing pretty well.

621
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,999
I asked you to stay by his side

622
00:31:17,479 --> 00:31:18,880
and you have never left him.

623
00:31:19,999 --> 00:31:22,317
Sometimes, the intentions are good.

624
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,479
But you can't ignore the consequences.

625
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,880
If you do a good thing,
you should be praised.

626
00:31:26,239 --> 00:31:27,319
If you do a bad thing,
you must be criticized.

627
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,116
But I'm always like this.

628
00:31:31,199 --> 00:31:32,719
I don't consider the consequences.

629
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,680
Master.

630
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,040
What...

631
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,280
What should I do then?

632
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:42,156
If Senior Uncle can't wake up,

633
00:31:42,239 --> 00:31:44,719
Granny Wu and Ms. Shen...

634
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,800
They're all looking forward to...

635
00:31:49,719 --> 00:31:50,519
I...

636
00:31:57,079 --> 00:31:57,879
Alright.

637
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:01,880
I'm still here.

638
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:05,839
Your apprenticeship
hasn't been completed yet, right?

639
00:32:07,239 --> 00:32:10,079
Even if there's a huge mistake,
you'll not be punished.

640
00:32:11,239 --> 00:32:12,039
I'll be punished.

641
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:16,116
Why do people need a master?

642
00:32:16,199 --> 00:32:17,719
That's to take the blame for you.

643
00:32:23,999 --> 00:32:25,520
Can you really do it?

644
00:32:25,959 --> 00:32:27,839
Otherwise, how can I be your master?

645
00:32:28,999 --> 00:32:29,799
Alright.

646
00:32:32,839 --> 00:32:33,639
Let's go back.

647
00:32:34,599 --> 00:32:35,399
Let's go.

648
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,680
Grandma.

649
00:32:46,959 --> 00:32:48,400
There are wine and cake here.

650
00:32:48,719 --> 00:32:50,280
What day is it today
that the dinner is so grand?

651
00:32:50,999 --> 00:32:52,079
A big day.

652
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,359
No one in our family
is celebrating a birthday today.

653
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:56,520
What day is it?

654
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,437
Today is your parents'

655
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,119
30th wedding anniversary.

656
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,560
Today?

657
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,999
Why are you playing on your phone?

658
00:33:15,199 --> 00:33:16,677
Gosh, you're...

659
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,359
Mom, we're home.

660
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:19,400
You're home.

661
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,520
What day is it today?

662
00:33:26,999 --> 00:33:29,680
Wedding anniversary.

663
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,396
Wedding...

664
00:33:32,479 --> 00:33:33,756
Dad.

665
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:35,280
Forget about it.

666
00:33:36,479 --> 00:33:38,876
If he remembers what day it is today,

667
00:33:38,959 --> 00:33:40,760
that will be scary.

668
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:45,400
It's been 30 years and I'm used to it.

669
00:33:45,959 --> 00:33:48,199
I've completed the tasks you gave me.

670
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,359
Thanks, Mom.

671
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,119
Wedding anniversary.

672
00:33:52,719 --> 00:33:53,760
We don't celebrate it.

673
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,479
We look like we're newlyweds every day.

674
00:33:56,563 --> 00:33:58,642
Mom, we celebrate
the wedding anniversary every day.

675
00:33:58,779 --> 00:34:00,475
-So, he remembers it.
-I remember.

676
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,720
Mom, do you believe him? Gosh.

677
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,597
Dad, it turns out you can talk so well.

678
00:34:05,746 --> 00:34:06,585
Now only you know about it.

679
00:34:06,893 --> 00:34:09,412
This is a man's survival instinct.

680
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:34,880
Do you know?

681
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:38,519
Xing Xing said
Mr. Wang that she took care of...

682
00:34:38,603 --> 00:34:39,637
What happened to him?

683
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,200
He wanted to come back.

684
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:43,039
-He wanted to come back?
-That's right.

685
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,039
He had been admitted for a long time.

686
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,640
Gosh.

687
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,640
I guess he's used to it.

688
00:34:50,319 --> 00:34:51,640
What an excuse!

689
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,119
It's always better
to stay at home than in the hospital.

690
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,200
Grandpa.

691
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,436
Just to be clear.

692
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:15,480
This wine is good,
but you can't drink too much.

693
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:24,760
Grandma.

694
00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:28,839
Thank you, son.

695
00:35:30,759 --> 00:35:31,799
Alright, it's my turn.

696
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:35,760
Okay.

697
00:35:36,279 --> 00:35:37,799
Hurry up. Your dad wants to speak.

698
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,920
Okay, right away.

699
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,000
Come on. I'm ready.

700
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,720
Dad, Mom.

701
00:35:45,559 --> 00:35:47,476
Master, Mrs. Song.

702
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:50,599
The first toast
is for the two of you, my elders.

703
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,319
You're like my parents.

704
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:56,480
You gave me a good life,

705
00:35:57,079 --> 00:35:58,200
taught me skills,

706
00:35:58,559 --> 00:35:59,519
taught me how to be a man,

707
00:36:00,519 --> 00:36:01,716
gave me this

708
00:36:01,799 --> 00:36:03,519
disobedient wife,

709
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,799
and an unfilial son.

710
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:08,759
You've got to be kidding me.

711
00:36:10,039 --> 00:36:11,956
Didn't I give you a happy life?

712
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:13,157
Yes, yes.

713
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,637
Didn't I give you such an excellent son?

714
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,676
-Yes, yes.
-That's right.

715
00:36:15,759 --> 00:36:17,319
The second toast is for you.

716
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,196
I can't mess up the order.

717
00:36:19,279 --> 00:36:20,279
Come, Master.

718
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:23,599
I have lived up to your expectations.

719
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:25,720
I'm not doing very well,

720
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,236
but to this family,

721
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:30,200
to my wife,

722
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,680
your daughter,

723
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,839
I put my heart and soul into it.

724
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,359
Whereas in teaching
and educating people,

725
00:36:36,519 --> 00:36:39,079
I have also followed your ways.

726
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,839
Thank you.

727
00:36:42,359 --> 00:36:43,240
Thank you, Mrs. Song.

728
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:46,000
Thank you, Dad, Mom.

729
00:36:54,799 --> 00:36:55,599
Tian Zhen.

730
00:36:56,359 --> 00:36:58,436
Don't you just have fun.

731
00:36:58,519 --> 00:37:00,799
-I...
-You have to watch this carefully.

732
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,720
We do this solemnly just to show you.

733
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:06,640
I'm afraid

734
00:37:07,319 --> 00:37:08,676
I can't celebrate

735
00:37:08,759 --> 00:37:11,559
your 30th wedding anniversary.

736
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:15,960
But your parents will remember

737
00:37:16,279 --> 00:37:20,119
this celebration and rules of theirs.

738
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:21,720
We'll just do this.

739
00:37:22,519 --> 00:37:23,799
We'll do this from now on.

740
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,520
By the way,

741
00:37:26,759 --> 00:37:30,119
you're missing a wife now.

742
00:37:32,319 --> 00:37:33,119
Grandpa.

743
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,359
I got it!

744
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,680
Rest assured.

745
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,119
Remember all these things.

746
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:41,039
This is your homework.

747
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,599
Write an observation essay later.

748
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,240
Yes, sir.

749
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,359
Gosh, you talk so much.

750
00:37:48,279 --> 00:37:50,000
Come, Master. A toast to you.

751
00:38:15,079 --> 00:38:16,480
Hello, are you Mr. Ren Tian Zhen?

752
00:38:16,799 --> 00:38:17,797
Keep your voice down. Thank you.

753
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,200
This is a gift you ordered.

754
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,520
Please give me the verification code.

755
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:21,636
Thanks.

756
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,720
Verification code...

757
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,319
Zero, three, one, six.

758
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:30,676
Okay. This service is completed.
Goodbye.

759
00:38:30,759 --> 00:38:32,000
Thank you for your hard work.

760
00:38:38,319 --> 00:38:39,440
He can't drink as much as me.

761
00:38:40,799 --> 00:38:42,956
It's true. He's not as good as me.

762
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:45,157
It turns out my dad
not only knows how to say good things.

763
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,397
Mom, look.

764
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,119
He secretly ordered a gift for you.

765
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:51,319
He just wanted to surprise you.

766
00:38:57,279 --> 00:38:58,273
Well...

767
00:38:58,799 --> 00:39:00,319
Why are you looking at me?

768
00:39:10,799 --> 00:39:12,000
I've been busted?

769
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,880
Our son has grown up.

770
00:39:14,759 --> 00:39:15,839
He's sensible now.

771
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,236
Come, come.

772
00:39:17,319 --> 00:39:19,117
Come, thank you, son. Thank you.

773
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:19,638
Good.

774
00:39:19,721 --> 00:39:21,996
Master, Mrs. Song, cheers.

775
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:23,476
Come, come.

776
00:39:23,559 --> 00:39:25,157
Happy anniversary.

777
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,960
Thanks.

778
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:51,039
In the blink of an eye,
30 years have passed.

779
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,880
At first, I thought

780
00:39:56,279 --> 00:39:58,480
I would get
an outstanding person like a dragon.

781
00:39:59,319 --> 00:40:00,119
But I didn't expect

782
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:03,279
to marry a snake like you.

783
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:07,519
Do you know what is
the common name for "snake"?

784
00:40:08,279 --> 00:40:09,079
Dragon on the earth.

785
00:40:10,039 --> 00:40:11,279
A dragon on the earth is also a dragon.

786
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:26,240
Do you still remember this place?

787
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,039
Back then,

788
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,040
I proposed to you at this place.

789
00:40:41,271 --> 00:40:45,302
(Thirty Years Ago)

790
00:40:51,343 --> 00:40:52,399
Give me a minute.

791
00:41:06,252 --> 00:41:07,264
Marry me.

792
00:41:14,201 --> 00:41:15,467
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

793
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:16,813
(are referenced from relevant
traditional Chinese medicine books)

794
00:41:16,896 --> 00:41:18,544
