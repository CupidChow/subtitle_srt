1
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,920
(Gen Z)

2
00:01:35,734 --> 00:01:37,840
(Episode 33)

3
00:01:40,443 --> 00:01:42,063
My mother-in-law is waiting outside.

4
00:01:42,243 --> 00:01:43,123
She has taken her blood pressure pill,

5
00:01:43,204 --> 00:01:44,965
but her blood pressure
is still over 200.

6
00:01:45,003 --> 00:01:45,803
Tell me,

7
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:48,402
do you have the courage to go out

8
00:01:49,122 --> 00:01:50,450
and tell her to give up on her son?

9
00:01:50,531 --> 00:01:51,331
We might...

10
00:01:51,543 --> 00:01:53,023
We might lose two lives then.

11
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,440
Don't worry.

12
00:02:07,922 --> 00:02:08,843
If the surgery fails,

13
00:02:09,743 --> 00:02:10,783
I won't blame you.

14
00:02:11,322 --> 00:02:13,083
The worst case scenario is

15
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:18,195
he will become a vegetable, right?

16
00:02:21,243 --> 00:02:22,122
I will accept it.

17
00:02:28,602 --> 00:02:29,523
Mr Li,

18
00:02:30,203 --> 00:02:32,143
what are the chances
of my mentor waking up?

19
00:02:35,043 --> 00:02:36,043
Let me put it this way.

20
00:02:36,482 --> 00:02:37,883
Even if he wakes up,

21
00:02:38,723 --> 00:02:40,050
he won't be the same as before.

22
00:02:58,083 --> 00:02:59,163
Xin.

23
00:02:59,962 --> 00:03:01,763
-Xin.
-What happened?

24
00:03:04,483 --> 00:03:06,202
Our company has a project
with the school.

25
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,082
I went to see Mr Wu
to get his signature for the contract.

26
00:03:09,163 --> 00:03:10,202
I found him on the floor

27
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,199
when I entered his office.

28
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,160
How long has Mr Wu been unconscious?

29
00:03:15,242 --> 00:03:16,363
I don't know.

30
00:03:16,548 --> 00:03:19,154
But I called the emergency service
immediately when I found him.

31
00:03:27,363 --> 00:03:28,403
I don't know.

32
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,760
(In Operation)

33
00:03:44,562 --> 00:03:45,762
Here, eat up.

34
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,439
How did it go, son?

35
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,281
Will your teacher lend us some money?

36
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,562
Let our son finish dinner first.
Why are you being so impatient?

37
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,806
Of course you are patient.

38
00:03:58,363 --> 00:03:59,523
Of course you can wait.

39
00:04:00,189 --> 00:04:03,436
It's not your phone that the lawyer and
the insurance company have been calling.

40
00:04:04,482 --> 00:04:05,842
We've been here for three days.

41
00:04:06,922 --> 00:04:08,362
He claimed his friend was a lawyer,

42
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,761
and his teacher would lend us money.

43
00:04:09,842 --> 00:04:10,642
Where is the lawyer?

44
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,402
-Where is the money?
-That's enough.

45
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,922
What's the use of raising this son?

46
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:15,562
All you do is complaining.

47
00:04:15,642 --> 00:04:16,562
Stop blabbering.

48
00:04:16,642 --> 00:04:18,283
You don't understand.
He's got money.

49
00:04:18,363 --> 00:04:20,762
He's living in such a big house
alone in this big city.

50
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,241
He just doesn't want to give us money.

51
00:04:22,322 --> 00:04:24,842
He's been going in and out for days,
yet he didn't even bring home a penny.

52
00:04:24,922 --> 00:04:26,923
That's enough. Stop it.

53
00:04:27,003 --> 00:04:28,523
You can't blame him.

54
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,480
We are in such a big trouble.
Who else can we rely on?

55
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:31,523
Who else if not him?

56
00:04:32,482 --> 00:04:33,282
Stop nagging.

57
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:37,083
I'm sick of waiting.

58
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,920
300,000 yuan.

59
00:04:48,282 --> 00:04:50,003
You see, I told you he's got money.

60
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,200
And you didn't believe me.

61
00:04:51,282 --> 00:04:52,122
Quan,

62
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,320
where...

63
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,420
Where did you get so much money from?

64
00:04:56,482 --> 00:04:58,003
-I borrowed it.
-Borrowed?

65
00:04:58,202 --> 00:04:59,723
But how are you going to repay

66
00:04:59,803 --> 00:05:01,363
such a large sum of money?

67
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:05,682
My company will give me a big bonus
at the end of the year.

68
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,886
I'll use that to repay it.

69
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,279
What company?

70
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:10,570
Aren't you working
at the medical centre?

71
00:05:10,803 --> 00:05:12,042
Who cares?

72
00:05:12,236 --> 00:05:13,602
This will solve our problem.

73
00:05:13,682 --> 00:05:15,282
Solve our problem?

74
00:05:16,642 --> 00:05:17,523
Look at our son,

75
00:05:17,796 --> 00:05:19,356
he was hiding his money from us.

76
00:05:19,456 --> 00:05:21,096
All you care about is money.

77
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,480
Give me the card. Give it to me.

78
00:05:23,642 --> 00:05:25,083
If we have to live in poverty
our whole lives, so be it.

79
00:05:25,163 --> 00:05:27,482
But we can't add to his burden.
Give me the card.

80
00:05:27,562 --> 00:05:29,003
You just don't understand.
We have a big trouble now.

81
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,799
-Who else can we rely on if not him?
-You can't do this.

82
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,800
Let's go back and
talk to the village chief.

83
00:05:32,969 --> 00:05:35,482
We'll rent a land
and mortgage the fish pond.

84
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,841
Are you crazy?

85
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,363
I dug that fish pond with my own hands,
shovel by shovel.

86
00:05:39,482 --> 00:05:41,562
I got all kinds of ailments
because of it.

87
00:05:42,756 --> 00:05:44,283
This pond is my life.

88
00:05:44,363 --> 00:05:45,202
We can't let them have it so easily.

89
00:05:45,282 --> 00:05:46,762
-Give me the card!
-Don't move.

90
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,400
Our son needs this money
to buy a house and get married.

91
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:50,683
-Let go.
-Give it to me.

92
00:05:51,323 --> 00:05:52,123
Quan.

93
00:05:52,323 --> 00:05:53,443
-Quan.
-Let go.

94
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,943
You are not making
a sensible choice.

95
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,240
The surgery was successful,

96
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:41,563
but why isn't he

97
00:06:41,643 --> 00:06:43,002
waking up by now?

98
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,282
I already told you about
the possible risks before the surgery.

99
00:06:46,362 --> 00:06:48,762
The current situation
is already relatively ideal.

100
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:50,483
Okay, I understand.

101
00:06:50,682 --> 00:06:51,882
But you

102
00:06:51,962 --> 00:06:54,362
Western medicine doctors said
that you've done everything you could.

103
00:06:55,043 --> 00:06:57,450
Why can't I try other methods?

104
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,080
-Why can't we give it a try?
-He just had his surgery.

105
00:07:00,242 --> 00:07:01,963
It's the critical period for him.

106
00:07:02,043 --> 00:07:03,843
Just wait a little longer
and be patient.

107
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,282
It's not the time to panic
and seek random medical treatments.

108
00:07:06,362 --> 00:07:07,563
Li, Li.

109
00:07:07,643 --> 00:07:08,762
Please calm down.

110
00:07:08,842 --> 00:07:10,602
(Grandma Wu)
This is not random medical treatments.

111
00:07:10,682 --> 00:07:11,882
Yes.

112
00:07:11,962 --> 00:07:13,123
We just want to explore

113
00:07:13,203 --> 00:07:14,962
if there are any other options.

114
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,022
I'll take responsibility
if anything goes wrong.

115
00:07:19,362 --> 00:07:20,162
All right?

116
00:07:21,082 --> 00:07:23,122
I'm a doctor just like you.

117
00:07:23,802 --> 00:07:24,602
Let me in.

118
00:07:26,122 --> 00:07:27,082
Let you go in?

119
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,401
Not a chance.

120
00:07:28,856 --> 00:07:30,336
I know you will perform acupuncture
on him when you go in.

121
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:32,162
His blood pressure
is so unstable right now.

122
00:07:32,242 --> 00:07:34,522
You need to let him recuperate first.

123
00:07:35,043 --> 00:07:36,683
Don't stimulate him for the time being.

124
00:07:36,763 --> 00:07:38,162
If your acupuncture treatment
goes wrong,

125
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,468
if he has another haemorrhage,
we'll have a trouble then.

126
00:07:40,549 --> 00:07:42,950
Isn't he already in trouble now?

127
00:07:47,402 --> 00:07:48,202
Shen Xin,

128
00:07:49,242 --> 00:07:50,643
I've done everything I could.

129
00:07:50,802 --> 00:07:52,723
You make the call.

130
00:07:54,923 --> 00:07:57,682
Let's be rational.

131
00:07:58,323 --> 00:08:01,162
I admit that you, Ren Xin Zheng,
are highly skilled in medicine.

132
00:08:01,242 --> 00:08:02,843
However, at this point,

133
00:08:02,923 --> 00:08:04,683
whether it's TCM or Western medicine,

134
00:08:04,897 --> 00:08:07,057
they can't make much of a difference.

135
00:08:07,743 --> 00:08:08,623
Go and check on him.

136
00:08:09,802 --> 00:08:10,602
Please leave.

137
00:08:12,643 --> 00:08:14,202
-You should leave.
-Li.

138
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:17,122
-I...
-Whether you allow it or not,

139
00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:19,402
we are going in the ICU today.

140
00:08:19,522 --> 00:08:22,255
It's already a desperate situation.
We have to try everything we can.

141
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,760
Li,

142
00:08:37,282 --> 00:08:38,402
the surgery is done.

143
00:08:39,483 --> 00:08:41,923
Whether the outcome is good or bad,

144
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,897
-I accept it.
-You can't accept it.

145
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,960
Your husband is the principal of
University of TCM.

146
00:08:48,122 --> 00:08:49,923
Not only does he have to stay alive,

147
00:08:50,003 --> 00:08:51,329
he will recover and

148
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,759
get back to teaching everyone.

149
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,761
Yes, that's what I mean.

150
00:08:58,682 --> 00:08:59,962
Don't worry.

151
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,519
This is Shao Dao's pre-destined ordeal.

152
00:09:04,456 --> 00:09:06,042
He needs to get through it on his own.

153
00:09:07,522 --> 00:09:11,762
We don't want him to spend the
rest of his life lying in bed, do we?

154
00:09:12,402 --> 00:09:13,202
Yes.

155
00:09:13,402 --> 00:09:14,682
You have a good heart.

156
00:09:15,782 --> 00:09:18,429
Your teacher must be proud
to have a student like you.

157
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,441
No matter what,

158
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,893
you have to let my master go in
and check on him today.

159
00:09:24,509 --> 00:09:25,309
Child,

160
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,161
it's not that I don't believe in TCM.

161
00:09:28,362 --> 00:09:30,163
It's just that he has
just undergone a major surgery.

162
00:09:30,282 --> 00:09:31,682
His blood vessels are fragile.

163
00:09:32,603 --> 00:09:33,963
It would be better
to wait until he's out of

164
00:09:34,043 --> 00:09:35,403
the critical period before
performing acupuncture.

165
00:09:35,483 --> 00:09:38,082
-No.
-I absolutely trust in TCM.

166
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:39,562
I'm just concerned about
the risk of a secondary rupture.

167
00:09:39,682 --> 00:09:41,082
We need to use a dual approach.

168
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,960
The sooner we do acupuncture,

169
00:09:43,043 --> 00:09:44,842
the faster his consciousness
will recover.

170
00:09:44,923 --> 00:09:46,002
But the risk is high.

171
00:09:46,082 --> 00:09:47,242
That's his fate.

172
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:50,723
Let them go in.

173
00:09:52,923 --> 00:09:54,563
-Shen Xin.
-Mum.

174
00:09:54,643 --> 00:09:56,402
Shan Dao is your husband.

175
00:09:56,682 --> 00:09:58,163
He's also my son.

176
00:09:58,323 --> 00:09:59,923
I know you're thinking of me,

177
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,719
which is why you insisted on
performing the surgery.

178
00:10:03,522 --> 00:10:06,362
But now, I have to think of you too.

179
00:10:06,802 --> 00:10:08,843
I can't let you handle this burden

180
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,602
for the rest of your life.

181
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,360
No, Mum.

182
00:10:13,576 --> 00:10:15,735
Leave this to Xin Zheng.

183
00:10:18,602 --> 00:10:19,403
Madam.

184
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:25,283
Madam.

185
00:10:26,203 --> 00:10:27,122
Don't worry.

186
00:10:27,242 --> 00:10:28,289
I will leave him to you.

187
00:10:28,682 --> 00:10:29,922
If anything goes wrong,

188
00:10:30,482 --> 00:10:31,802
I will take the responsibility.

189
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,840
Thank you.

190
00:10:34,162 --> 00:10:34,962
I will go in now.

191
00:10:35,362 --> 00:10:37,283
-Thank you.
-Ren, Ren.

192
00:10:38,602 --> 00:10:39,682
Are you confident?

193
00:10:41,042 --> 00:10:43,162
Yes.

194
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:45,842
Child, we think the same way.

195
00:10:45,922 --> 00:10:48,203
Yes, first you have to believe,

196
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:49,602
and then you will see.

197
00:10:49,922 --> 00:10:51,682
Tou Tou, go get changed.

198
00:10:52,482 --> 00:10:53,575
I know where the room is.

199
00:10:55,763 --> 00:10:56,643
Mr Ren,

200
00:10:57,362 --> 00:10:58,203
let me go in.

201
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,520
You should stay here.

202
00:11:00,682 --> 00:11:02,282
There is too little room in there.

203
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:03,523
Wait outside.

204
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,161
But Mr Wu is my mentor.

205
00:11:06,469 --> 00:11:08,742
I'll get anxious out here
if I don't take a look at him.

206
00:11:11,162 --> 00:11:12,242
You are a good student.

207
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,360
You should stay here

208
00:11:13,482 --> 00:11:14,883
with your mentor's wife and mother.

209
00:11:16,682 --> 00:11:17,482
Mr Ren,

210
00:11:18,482 --> 00:11:20,362
you should let Tou Tou
stay here with them.

211
00:11:20,602 --> 00:11:21,602
I will go in with you.

212
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:22,522
After I go in,

213
00:11:22,603 --> 00:11:24,403
I won't talk and do anything. Okay?

214
00:11:25,555 --> 00:11:26,435
You can't go in.

215
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,281
Why can't I go in?

216
00:11:29,602 --> 00:11:30,402
Ren.

217
00:11:31,042 --> 00:11:31,842
Ren.

218
00:11:33,482 --> 00:11:35,362
Li Quan is Shan Dao's student.

219
00:11:35,682 --> 00:11:36,923
It's only right to let him go in.

220
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,922
Don't take away his chance
to show filial piety.

221
00:11:39,003 --> 00:11:40,802
Ren, let him go in.

222
00:11:41,162 --> 00:11:42,283
I've heard about him.

223
00:11:42,562 --> 00:11:44,282
Wu mentioned him to me before.

224
00:11:44,362 --> 00:11:46,283
He's quite attentive to him.

225
00:11:48,443 --> 00:11:49,243
Thank you, sir.

226
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,398
(Jiangzhou People's Hospital)

227
00:12:41,763 --> 00:12:43,956
Tou Tou, look at the spot
where I inserted the needle.

228
00:12:44,482 --> 00:12:45,682
You will do this next time.

229
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,043
Tou Tou, stop inserting the needle.

230
00:12:55,124 --> 00:12:56,335
His blood pressure is rising.

231
00:12:57,896 --> 00:12:59,323
Mr Ren, this is too dangerous.

232
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:00,323
What is going on?
Where is Zhao? Why isn't he here?

233
00:14:00,876 --> 00:14:01,999
He took a half day off

234
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,601
to visit his teacher in the hospital.

235
00:14:05,722 --> 00:14:06,563
All right.

236
00:14:06,643 --> 00:14:07,843
Get back to work.

237
00:14:15,242 --> 00:14:16,283
What's going on?

238
00:14:16,443 --> 00:14:18,463
The manager has come
looking for him three times.

239
00:14:18,802 --> 00:14:20,203
It must be about Mr Wu.

240
00:14:20,283 --> 00:14:22,679
As you know, we have
a good relationship with Mr Wu.

241
00:14:22,883 --> 00:14:23,962
We were hoping to get on

242
00:14:24,042 --> 00:14:26,122
the procurement list for University
of Chinese Medicine Affiliated Hospital.

243
00:14:27,122 --> 00:14:29,242
Now this is great.
Mr Wu has fallen ill.

244
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:31,122
I don't know what will happen next.

245
00:14:41,122 --> 00:14:42,122
Zhao,

246
00:14:42,602 --> 00:14:43,923
what took you so long?

247
00:14:44,003 --> 00:14:45,883
Come here now.
I have something to ask you.

248
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:48,922
Where have you been?
I've been waiting for you.

249
00:14:49,356 --> 00:14:50,156
Walk faster.

250
00:14:52,003 --> 00:14:53,283
You see, I was right, wasn't I?

251
00:14:54,482 --> 00:14:55,522
This is pretty good.

252
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,600
Give me another one.

253
00:15:02,162 --> 00:15:04,042
Zhao, tell me now.

254
00:15:04,562 --> 00:15:05,362
How was it?

255
00:15:06,068 --> 00:15:06,989
What do you mean?

256
00:15:10,343 --> 00:15:12,082
Mr Wu's surgery was successful.

257
00:15:12,222 --> 00:15:13,862
He is still in a coma.

258
00:15:14,802 --> 00:15:16,963
He will probably stay in a coma
for a while.

259
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,195
I'm not asking you about his condition.

260
00:15:19,276 --> 00:15:20,476
I meant the contract.

261
00:15:21,802 --> 00:15:22,922
I didn't see the contract.

262
00:15:23,283 --> 00:15:24,242
You didn't see it?

263
00:15:25,482 --> 00:15:26,282
What about the card?

264
00:15:27,562 --> 00:15:29,162
I gave it to him. You knew that.

265
00:15:30,482 --> 00:15:31,802
The card is gone too?

266
00:15:32,602 --> 00:15:33,523
Everything is gone.

267
00:15:38,362 --> 00:15:40,523
All my efforts have gone to waste.

268
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,601
I can't believe this.

269
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,680
I'm so unlucky.

270
00:15:55,922 --> 00:15:56,722
Hang on.

271
00:15:58,122 --> 00:15:59,989
Didn't you have a chance
to ask him about it?

272
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,800
Answer me.

273
00:16:07,562 --> 00:16:08,922
Mr Wu was already lying on

274
00:16:09,602 --> 00:16:12,602
the floor when I walked in his office.

275
00:16:15,362 --> 00:16:16,482
He was unconscious.

276
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,760
How could I ask anything?

277
00:16:32,122 --> 00:16:32,922
Zhao,

278
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,155
this is what you will do.

279
00:16:35,922 --> 00:16:37,003
Go to the bank and check

280
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,401
if any money has been
withdrawn from the account.

281
00:16:39,482 --> 00:16:40,695
If nothing has been taken,

282
00:16:41,162 --> 00:16:42,509
quickly report it as lost.

283
00:16:42,922 --> 00:16:44,042
Lock the funds

284
00:16:44,122 --> 00:16:45,162
and then reapply the card

285
00:16:45,482 --> 00:16:46,435
to retrieve the money.

286
00:16:48,722 --> 00:16:50,523
Based on what I know about Mr Wu,

287
00:16:51,122 --> 00:16:51,922
we might

288
00:16:52,443 --> 00:16:54,162
still have a chance
to recover the money.

289
00:16:56,883 --> 00:16:57,922
Go and take care of it.

290
00:16:58,362 --> 00:16:59,895
Let me know if there's any update.

291
00:17:02,602 --> 00:17:04,042
Well, go now. Don't just sit there.

292
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,480
Okay.

293
00:17:34,763 --> 00:17:35,563
Jian Xi,

294
00:17:36,122 --> 00:17:37,522
besides the cool sensation
in your feet,

295
00:17:37,562 --> 00:17:39,082
do you feel anything in other areas?

296
00:17:41,222 --> 00:17:42,022
No.

297
00:17:43,003 --> 00:17:44,763
I only felt that once.

298
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,886
I have been feeling nothing after that.

299
00:17:49,242 --> 00:17:51,202
The medicine is not hot anymore.
Here, drink it.

300
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,480
Come, get up.

301
00:17:52,562 --> 00:17:53,402
Let me help her.

302
00:17:53,482 --> 00:17:54,282
Let me.

303
00:17:57,142 --> 00:17:57,949
Okay.

304
00:17:58,283 --> 00:17:59,083
Jian Xi.

305
00:18:00,042 --> 00:18:01,115
I don't want to drink it.

306
00:18:02,283 --> 00:18:03,203
Come on, drink it.

307
00:18:03,356 --> 00:18:05,276
I said I don't want to.

308
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:10,122
Mum, do you really think
this medicine is effective?

309
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,440
I will never stand again.

310
00:18:12,643 --> 00:18:14,803
I've taken the medicine,
tried the local remedies,

311
00:18:14,943 --> 00:18:16,503
had acupuncture,
and received massages,

312
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:18,763
but I don't feel anything at all.

313
00:18:19,983 --> 00:18:20,903
Jian Xi,

314
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:24,243
this medicine was personally
prescribed by Professor Ren.

315
00:18:24,423 --> 00:18:26,103
The herbs were prepared by
Tou Tou and Tian Zhen.

316
00:18:26,162 --> 00:18:27,482
Decocted by Yang Xiao Hong.

317
00:18:27,562 --> 00:18:30,162
Don't underestimate
this small bowl of liquid.

318
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:32,303
It carries everyone's hope.

319
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:33,695
Come on, drink it.

320
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,440
No.

321
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,200
We still need to
go through this process.

322
00:18:41,275 --> 00:18:43,002
Let's complete this process.

323
00:18:43,149 --> 00:18:45,630
If it works, that's great.
If not, we'll accept it.

324
00:18:45,763 --> 00:18:46,563
Right?

325
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,560
Come on, drink it.

326
00:18:48,683 --> 00:18:49,483
Here.

327
00:18:53,482 --> 00:18:54,362
I know

328
00:18:55,362 --> 00:18:56,908
you have the thought of dying again.

329
00:18:58,842 --> 00:19:00,962
You don't want to burden me,

330
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,880
and you don't want to be paralysed
like this for the rest of your life,

331
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:04,742
right?

332
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,721
But you can't leave, you know?

333
00:19:11,242 --> 00:19:12,362
If you left,

334
00:19:13,202 --> 00:19:14,683
wouldn't that be punishing

335
00:19:14,763 --> 00:19:16,283
all of us who love you?

336
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,400
I used to resent it,

337
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:22,097
thinking that life was unfair to me.

338
00:19:22,315 --> 00:19:25,642
Why is it that other people's children
can work, date,

339
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,881
get married, have children,

340
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,400
while my daughter has to be paralysed
in bed for a lifetime,

341
00:19:30,482 --> 00:19:32,442
and I have to take care
of her every need.

342
00:19:33,563 --> 00:19:36,482
But now, I don't resent it anymore.

343
00:19:36,696 --> 00:19:37,895
I'm actually grateful.

344
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,080
It shows that

345
00:19:40,162 --> 00:19:42,922
the bond between us, mother
and daughter, is incredibly strong.

346
00:19:43,202 --> 00:19:45,762
That's why fate has kept you by my side,

347
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,280
accompanying me every day.

348
00:19:47,421 --> 00:19:48,421
Tell me,

349
00:19:48,602 --> 00:19:51,282
which other mother is as lucky as me?

350
00:19:51,962 --> 00:19:53,442
That's right, Jian Xi.

351
00:19:54,602 --> 00:19:55,402
Don't worry.

352
00:19:56,136 --> 00:19:58,136
The accident was caused by Cheng Ying.

353
00:19:58,602 --> 00:20:00,162
Your mum shouldn't bear it alone.

354
00:20:00,321 --> 00:20:01,968
Cheng Ying and I have talked about this.

355
00:20:02,643 --> 00:20:04,723
We've agreed that
as long as we are still here,

356
00:20:04,863 --> 00:20:07,429
the three of us will take care
of you for the rest of your life.

357
00:20:12,442 --> 00:20:13,642
Me too, me too.

358
00:20:13,722 --> 00:20:15,563
I will take care of you too.

359
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,080
You two are together now?

360
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,000
Jian Xi,

361
00:20:37,163 --> 00:20:38,763
you need to have faith in yourself.

362
00:20:38,923 --> 00:20:42,442
You felt a slight improvement before.

363
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:44,030
I'm sure that wasn't an illusion.

364
00:20:44,202 --> 00:20:45,842
You are gradually recovering.

365
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:47,850
You should believe in
what Ms Dong said.

366
00:20:48,155 --> 00:20:50,275
It's called a spiral upward.

367
00:20:51,043 --> 00:20:52,043
Even stepping back

368
00:20:52,442 --> 00:20:53,923
is a form of progress.

369
00:20:55,442 --> 00:20:57,842
Actually, I'm quite grateful
to Cheng Ying's ex-husband.

370
00:20:58,563 --> 00:21:00,242
He was with such a good woman.

371
00:21:00,883 --> 00:21:01,989
Yet he didn't cherish her.

372
00:21:03,002 --> 00:21:03,802
Fine.

373
00:21:04,242 --> 00:21:05,842
He gave me a chance
to take care of her.

374
00:21:06,976 --> 00:21:07,856
Wu Yu,

375
00:21:08,362 --> 00:21:09,283
you are a real man.

376
00:21:11,322 --> 00:21:12,442
Don't worry.

377
00:21:12,722 --> 00:21:15,163
We will create a miracle with you.

378
00:21:15,562 --> 00:21:17,243
Yes, create a miracle.

379
00:21:17,562 --> 00:21:19,082
That's right. A miracle.

380
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:25,295
Drink your medicine.

381
00:21:26,122 --> 00:21:26,922
Here.

382
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,880
Quan,

383
00:22:12,322 --> 00:22:14,282
you are home early today.

384
00:22:14,362 --> 00:22:15,283
No overtime?

385
00:22:15,823 --> 00:22:17,382
Yes, I'm not working overtime today.

386
00:22:18,523 --> 00:22:20,323
Mum, I noticed that you've been

387
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,159
withdrawing all the money
little by little every day.

388
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,576
(How did it go with the fish pond?)

389
00:22:24,803 --> 00:22:26,082
Listen, Quan,

390
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:28,162
that friend you introduced

391
00:22:28,242 --> 00:22:29,563
is really capable.

392
00:22:29,643 --> 00:22:30,883
(He brought the person)

393
00:22:31,003 --> 00:22:32,683
(who fell into the pond)

394
00:22:32,763 --> 00:22:34,723
(in broad daylight)

395
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:36,335
to our house today.

396
00:22:36,883 --> 00:22:38,283
His attitude

397
00:22:39,643 --> 00:22:42,202
has completely changed.

398
00:22:43,803 --> 00:22:45,763
(He is willing to settle)

399
00:22:46,122 --> 00:22:47,203
(and bear some of the losses)

400
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,440
(of our fish pond.)

401
00:22:50,003 --> 00:22:52,643
He's so capable.

402
00:22:52,763 --> 00:22:54,042
He also told us

403
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:55,283
not to worry

404
00:22:55,523 --> 00:22:58,283
and said that the other two
will withdraw their lawsuits soon.

405
00:23:00,603 --> 00:23:01,443
That's good.

406
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,721
Is the money enough?

407
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,280
It's more than enough.

408
00:23:09,375 --> 00:23:11,323
There will be some left.

409
00:23:11,403 --> 00:23:13,763
Your dad said to return
the remaining money to you.

410
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,680
It's okay, Mum.

411
00:23:16,743 --> 00:23:17,582
Keep the money.

412
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:19,257
Use it to repair the house with my dad.

413
00:23:19,763 --> 00:23:22,403
Also, hire some people
to clean up the fish pond.

414
00:23:22,649 --> 00:23:23,736
Don't let Dad do it alone.

415
00:23:25,523 --> 00:23:28,602
Quan, this money is not a small amount.

416
00:23:28,883 --> 00:23:30,283
Don't give it all to us.

417
00:23:31,242 --> 00:23:33,362
Keep some for yourself, got it?

418
00:23:34,003 --> 00:23:34,883
It's okay, Mum.

419
00:23:36,403 --> 00:23:37,203
I can earn it back.

420
00:23:38,643 --> 00:23:39,923
Ask my brother to study well.

421
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:40,960
I have to go.

422
00:24:15,283 --> 00:24:16,283
Morning, Mr Li.

423
00:24:16,482 --> 00:24:17,683
You are here so early.

424
00:24:18,403 --> 00:24:20,563
You're such a good student,

425
00:24:20,643 --> 00:24:21,883
reporting in every day.

426
00:24:22,722 --> 00:24:23,602
Have you visited him?

427
00:24:24,163 --> 00:24:24,963
Not yet.

428
00:24:25,403 --> 00:24:26,842
I want to talk to you first.

429
00:24:28,482 --> 00:24:29,282
How can I help you?

430
00:24:30,242 --> 00:24:31,043
Well, Mr Li,

431
00:24:31,883 --> 00:24:32,963
I want to know about

432
00:24:33,043 --> 00:24:34,683
my mentor's recent condition.

433
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,041
Haven't Mr Ren and Tou Tou
been giving him acupuncture?

434
00:24:37,122 --> 00:24:38,035
Has it been effective?

435
00:24:40,763 --> 00:24:43,883
Currently, the results are
not very noticeable.

436
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,800
Although all the vital signs
have stabilized,

437
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:49,282
he hasn't regained consciousness.

438
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:51,616
It's been more than ten days.
As you know,

439
00:24:51,723 --> 00:24:53,482
the longer a person remains in a coma,

440
00:24:53,602 --> 00:24:55,763
the less likely they are to wake up.

441
00:24:58,643 --> 00:24:59,443
Do you think

442
00:24:59,602 --> 00:25:01,403
there's still a chance
for him to wake up?

443
00:25:02,523 --> 00:25:03,323
Zhao,

444
00:25:04,689 --> 00:25:06,089
we've done everything we could.

445
00:25:09,683 --> 00:25:10,483
Sir,

446
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:13,349
please give me an accurate assessment.

447
00:25:13,482 --> 00:25:15,702
I need to know what I can say to
his wife and mother.

448
00:25:22,362 --> 00:25:23,403
Let me put it this way.

449
00:25:24,203 --> 00:25:26,723
Brain damage is usually permanent.

450
00:25:27,163 --> 00:25:29,403
Even if he wakes up one day,

451
00:25:29,683 --> 00:25:31,883
he won't be the same as before.

452
00:25:36,242 --> 00:25:37,122
I understand.

453
00:25:37,362 --> 00:25:38,163
Go see him.

454
00:25:39,137 --> 00:25:39,937
Thank you.

455
00:25:46,683 --> 00:25:48,803
Mrs Wu, these are 1,000
origami cranes folded by

456
00:25:48,883 --> 00:25:52,082
students from our undergraduate,
master's, and doctoral years.

457
00:25:52,276 --> 00:25:54,235
Each crane represents
our wishes for Mr Wu.

458
00:25:54,403 --> 00:25:56,883
We hope that Mr Wu can wake up soon.

459
00:25:58,403 --> 00:26:00,323
You can give it to me.
I will take it in later.

460
00:26:01,003 --> 00:26:02,203
Mrs Wu, and this. Look.

461
00:26:02,283 --> 00:26:03,083
These are

462
00:26:03,163 --> 00:26:04,322
photos of us with Mr Wu.

463
00:26:04,482 --> 00:26:05,763
I made it into a video,

464
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,842
with his favourite song
playing in the background.

465
00:26:07,923 --> 00:26:09,803
You can place it by his bedside.

466
00:26:10,163 --> 00:26:11,282
And he will receive
our heartfelt message

467
00:26:11,362 --> 00:26:13,263
of longing for his return to the school.

468
00:26:16,883 --> 00:26:17,683
Okay.

469
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,760
Thank you.

470
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:20,970
You all are truly thoughtful.

471
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:23,362
Knowing that his students

472
00:26:24,003 --> 00:26:24,963
care so much

473
00:26:25,043 --> 00:26:26,242
about him,

474
00:26:27,683 --> 00:26:29,096
Mr Wu will regain consciousness.

475
00:26:30,122 --> 00:26:31,003
Wu Shan Dao's family,

476
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,082
please go downstairs
to make payment.

477
00:26:33,163 --> 00:26:34,683
-Coming right away.
-Leave these to me.

478
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:35,960
Thank you, Tou Tou.

479
00:26:39,602 --> 00:26:41,803
When did you make this?

480
00:26:42,003 --> 00:26:43,163
Recently.

481
00:26:43,283 --> 00:26:45,163
And you did such a good job.

482
00:26:46,523 --> 00:26:47,803
And you put so many people in here.

483
00:26:47,883 --> 00:26:48,683
Li Quan?

484
00:26:50,523 --> 00:26:51,570
What are you doing here?

485
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,068
I brought a token of good gesture
for Mrs Wu on behalf of our friends.

486
00:26:54,149 --> 00:26:56,190
I was just about to leave.
I have classes.

487
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,200
By the way, I've been
wanting to ask you.

488
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:02,282
Mr Wu was still fine
when we went to see him that day.

489
00:27:02,362 --> 00:27:04,003
How did he fall down?

490
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:07,042
-You still have classes, right?
-Hang on.

491
00:27:09,602 --> 00:27:11,803
You two went to see Mr Wu together?

492
00:27:12,315 --> 00:27:14,677
Yes. Li Quan and I went in together.

493
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,040
But I just went in
to pass him some documents.

494
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,520
I left after I delivered the documents.

495
00:27:17,602 --> 00:27:18,523
So,

496
00:27:18,683 --> 00:27:20,083
I didn't see

497
00:27:20,403 --> 00:27:21,362
how Mr Wu fell down.

498
00:27:21,643 --> 00:27:23,896
Don't make blind assumptions
if you didn't witness it.

499
00:27:24,122 --> 00:27:25,883
Maybe he didn't just slip and fall.

500
00:27:26,163 --> 00:27:28,323
It could be caused by
a ruptured blood vessel,

501
00:27:28,403 --> 00:27:29,283
understand?

502
00:27:30,163 --> 00:27:32,563
It's a chicken and egg situation,
which came first?

503
00:27:34,283 --> 00:27:35,842
Okay, I'm off to class then.

504
00:27:36,643 --> 00:27:37,443
Tou Tou,

505
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,560
Mr Ren said he changed
his treatment solution today.

506
00:27:39,643 --> 00:27:40,443
Tell me about it.

507
00:27:41,043 --> 00:27:41,843
Tou Tou.

508
00:27:45,883 --> 00:27:46,683
Tou Tou.

509
00:27:47,122 --> 00:27:48,283
I'm here.

510
00:27:49,803 --> 00:27:51,163
Sun Tou Tou,

511
00:27:51,283 --> 00:27:53,883
You two are showing off your love,
even on my turf.

512
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,680
I'm already full just by watching you.

513
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:57,229
You guys are outrageous.

514
00:27:57,403 --> 00:27:59,162
-Where is he?
-He's not here.

515
00:27:59,242 --> 00:28:00,616
He's downstairs. He can't get in.

516
00:28:09,403 --> 00:28:10,590
I'm going to have breakfast.

517
00:28:15,003 --> 00:28:16,523
Why are you here so early today?

518
00:28:17,443 --> 00:28:19,243
I'm worried about Mr Wu's condition.

519
00:28:19,403 --> 00:28:21,043
So, I came here early.

520
00:28:21,362 --> 00:28:23,283
Don't worry too much about Mr Wu.

521
00:28:23,523 --> 00:28:24,443
Tou Tou told me that

522
00:28:24,523 --> 00:28:26,443
Mr. Ren is very experienced
and has confidence.

523
00:28:26,576 --> 00:28:28,015
He will wake up soon.

524
00:28:29,602 --> 00:28:30,643
Can you tell me

525
00:28:30,962 --> 00:28:32,122
what else she told you?

526
00:28:44,003 --> 00:28:44,803
Tou Tou.

527
00:28:50,003 --> 00:28:51,362
How is Mr Wu in these few days?

528
00:28:52,003 --> 00:28:53,163
Nothing's changed.

529
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:55,770
I heard from Mr Ren

530
00:28:56,362 --> 00:28:57,803
that he should recover soon.

531
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,760
We will do our best,
the rest is up to fate.

532
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,280
Actually, you don't have
to come here every day.

533
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:08,793
Once there is good news,
I will share it in the chat group.

534
00:29:25,283 --> 00:29:26,482
What's going on?

535
00:29:29,643 --> 00:29:31,643
What's wrong? What happened?

536
00:29:32,602 --> 00:29:33,523
What did you do?

537
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,039
Nothing.

538
00:29:36,763 --> 00:29:38,403
Then, how come...

539
00:29:38,643 --> 00:29:41,163
His blood pressure has soared to 190.

540
00:29:41,803 --> 00:29:43,282
This is a good thing.

541
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,561
It means he is responding
to the outside world.

542
00:29:45,883 --> 00:29:47,283
This response is too intense.

543
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,562
I will arrange for administration
of blood pressure medication.

544
00:29:49,643 --> 00:29:50,683
Don't stay here.

545
00:29:50,763 --> 00:29:52,563
-You all should go out first.
-Okay, okay.

546
00:29:52,643 --> 00:29:53,956
Why are you still sitting there?

547
00:30:03,122 --> 00:30:04,003
It's gone?

548
00:30:04,643 --> 00:30:05,443
When did it happen?

549
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:07,409
Just two days ago.

550
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:15,362
I'm so unlucky. I can't believe
this would happen to me.

551
00:30:17,389 --> 00:30:18,362
Hang on.

552
00:30:19,289 --> 00:30:21,043
He's lying in the hospital.

553
00:30:21,683 --> 00:30:22,923
How did the money go missing?

554
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:28,483
There is no way
he would tell other people about this.

555
00:30:29,242 --> 00:30:30,482
Maybe Mrs Wu took it.

556
00:30:31,763 --> 00:30:32,763
Think about it.

557
00:30:33,243 --> 00:30:35,682
Mr Wu is currently in the ICU,

558
00:30:35,763 --> 00:30:37,370
and it costs over 10,000 yuan per day.

559
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,200
Their family is in need
of money right now.

560
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,895
If his wife knew the password,
she would definitely withdraw the money.

561
00:30:41,976 --> 00:30:44,803
How did she know that the password
is the last six digits of your ID?

562
00:30:45,403 --> 00:30:47,683
As soon as I got the card,
I changed it to six zeros.

563
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,322
I thought it was convenient
for them to withdraw money.

564
00:30:49,403 --> 00:30:50,443
I told Mr Wu about it,

565
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:52,110
and he probably told his wife too.

566
00:30:52,857 --> 00:30:53,737
No way.

567
00:30:54,003 --> 00:30:56,082
He would actually
share such things with his wife?

568
00:30:57,356 --> 00:30:59,696
Oh my goodness, I can't believe
there are men like this.

569
00:31:02,283 --> 00:31:04,163
Zhao, this is what you will do.

570
00:31:04,403 --> 00:31:06,003
When you go to the bank,

571
00:31:06,163 --> 00:31:08,082
tell them that you lost the card.

572
00:31:08,362 --> 00:31:09,402
Then, you found out that
someone withdrew the money

573
00:31:09,482 --> 00:31:10,923
when you checked the record.

574
00:31:12,242 --> 00:31:14,942
Ask the bank to pull the surveillance
footage to see who took it.

575
00:31:15,643 --> 00:31:16,683
I refuse to believe

576
00:31:17,602 --> 00:31:20,242
that we can't recover this money.

577
00:31:22,643 --> 00:31:23,803
Isn't that inappropriate?

578
00:31:24,482 --> 00:31:26,242
What if Mr Wu wakes up?

579
00:31:27,003 --> 00:31:28,983
Will we still be able
to continue this business?

580
00:31:31,043 --> 00:31:33,322
It's you who said he won't wake up,

581
00:31:33,803 --> 00:31:35,643
and it's also you
who said he will wake up.

582
00:31:37,523 --> 00:31:39,443
Which possibility is more likely?

583
00:31:39,523 --> 00:31:40,362
Sir,

584
00:31:40,552 --> 00:31:41,913
this is what I think.

585
00:31:42,602 --> 00:31:45,602
Mr Wu is currently going through
a life-and-death situation.

586
00:31:46,122 --> 00:31:47,683
Considering our friendship,

587
00:31:47,763 --> 00:31:49,002
can't you just let it go
as an act of kindness?

588
00:31:49,082 --> 00:31:50,522
Do we really have to pursue this matter?

589
00:31:50,602 --> 00:31:51,402
No,

590
00:31:52,003 --> 00:31:53,883
I can't just give away 300,000 yuan.

591
00:31:54,163 --> 00:31:55,402
Go and check the surveillance footage.

592
00:31:55,482 --> 00:31:56,683
I need to know the truth.

593
00:31:57,122 --> 00:31:59,122
I want to see if it's his wife
who took the money.

594
00:31:59,883 --> 00:32:01,643
Okay, I will get it done.

595
00:32:01,923 --> 00:32:03,523
But Sir, you better think it through.

596
00:32:04,283 --> 00:32:06,163
Mr Wu is still the principal.

597
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:08,923
If he wakes up one day

598
00:32:09,003 --> 00:32:10,816
and finds out what you did
behind his back,

599
00:32:11,803 --> 00:32:12,842
then...

600
00:32:15,523 --> 00:32:16,323
Think it over.

601
00:32:24,803 --> 00:32:26,043
Let me think again.

602
00:32:29,122 --> 00:32:30,242
Go out first.

603
00:32:30,482 --> 00:32:31,283
Let me think again.

604
00:32:32,763 --> 00:32:33,563
Okay.

605
00:32:54,923 --> 00:32:56,482
Did you follow my medical advice?

606
00:33:02,242 --> 00:33:03,635
What does shaking your head mean?

607
00:33:06,883 --> 00:33:08,649
Today's treatment session
wasn't completed.

608
00:33:08,883 --> 00:33:11,602
Did his blood pressure
suddenly spike to 190?

609
00:33:12,763 --> 00:33:13,563
Yes.

610
00:33:17,283 --> 00:33:18,083
But...

611
00:33:18,283 --> 00:33:19,083
What?

612
00:33:22,883 --> 00:33:23,683
Spit it out.

613
00:33:27,643 --> 00:33:30,163
You said that we shouldn't say
anything without evidence.

614
00:33:30,403 --> 00:33:33,449
It's just my speculation now.
So, there is no need to say it.

615
00:33:35,043 --> 00:33:36,362
I told you before,

616
00:33:36,602 --> 00:33:38,403
what is the eye of TCM practitioners?

617
00:33:38,763 --> 00:33:39,563
Yin and Yang.

618
00:33:42,362 --> 00:33:45,242
The most important thing for
a TCM practitioner is intuition.

619
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:46,442
What is intuition?

620
00:33:46,883 --> 00:33:49,442
It's the information given to you
by a higher-dimensional space.

621
00:33:49,763 --> 00:33:51,603
Whatever you feel, just tell me.

622
00:33:51,683 --> 00:33:52,602
As for the results,

623
00:33:53,283 --> 00:33:55,523
we can discuss them
to determine if they are accurate.

624
00:34:01,403 --> 00:34:02,522
I think it has nothing to do
with the acupuncture,

625
00:34:02,602 --> 00:34:03,602
but rather with a person.

626
00:34:06,163 --> 00:34:07,322
Either Senior Uncle

627
00:34:08,283 --> 00:34:09,083
has something

628
00:34:10,682 --> 00:34:12,682
to tell Zhao Li Quan,

629
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,159
or Zhao Li Quan

630
00:34:16,235 --> 00:34:17,636
has something to do

631
00:34:20,322 --> 00:34:21,722
with his accident.

632
00:34:22,403 --> 00:34:23,836
But these are all just speculations

633
00:34:24,616 --> 00:34:25,416
without any basis.

634
00:34:26,403 --> 00:34:28,042
So, when Zhao Li Quan
gets close to Senior Uncle,

635
00:34:28,122 --> 00:34:29,403
his blood pressure goes up.

636
00:34:40,403 --> 00:34:43,563
You are saying that
his blood pressure spikes

637
00:34:43,643 --> 00:34:45,883
whenever Zhao Li Quan gets close to him?

638
00:34:47,403 --> 00:34:48,203
Yes.

639
00:34:50,283 --> 00:34:51,403
Okay, starting tomorrow,

640
00:34:52,602 --> 00:34:53,683
reduce the visitations.

641
00:34:55,356 --> 00:34:56,489
No one is allowed to go in.

642
00:34:56,883 --> 00:34:58,776
You will be the only one
standing guard there.

643
00:34:59,523 --> 00:35:01,482
I have already told the nurses

644
00:35:02,003 --> 00:35:04,643
not to allow Zhao Li Quan
enter the ward alone.

645
00:35:05,003 --> 00:35:06,683
Would the nurses listen to you?

646
00:35:09,803 --> 00:35:11,163
Just leave them to me.

647
00:35:11,283 --> 00:35:12,083
Dad,

648
00:35:12,163 --> 00:35:13,443
I'm visiting Senior Uncle tomorrow.

649
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,280
Grandpa asked me
to bring him something.

650
00:35:15,369 --> 00:35:16,649
Don't go tomorrow.

651
00:35:17,283 --> 00:35:18,122
If you go,

652
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,562
and Li Quan is not allowed to go,
it will upset him.

653
00:35:20,643 --> 00:35:22,643
Something like this bothers him a lot.

654
00:35:22,977 --> 00:35:24,256
Give the stuff to Tou Tou.

655
00:35:24,523 --> 00:35:25,596
She will bring it to him.

656
00:35:25,763 --> 00:35:26,563
Dad,

657
00:35:26,876 --> 00:35:28,675
you are closer to Tou Tou
than your own son.

658
00:35:29,003 --> 00:35:30,523
You let her go, but not me.

659
00:35:30,683 --> 00:35:31,523
You don't trust me.

660
00:35:32,242 --> 00:35:34,803
It's because you're his son,

661
00:35:35,163 --> 00:35:37,563
while Tou Tou is his senior aunt.

662
00:35:38,523 --> 00:35:42,403
It's only natural to entrust
such an important task to an elder.

663
00:35:43,603 --> 00:35:46,523
Just leave it to your elder.

664
00:36:08,803 --> 00:36:10,402
Tou Tou said that to you?

665
00:36:12,123 --> 00:36:14,722
But you can't just believe
her side of the story, right?

666
00:36:14,962 --> 00:36:17,603
What if she has a problem
with Zhao Li Quan?

667
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,480
She won't.

668
00:36:21,283 --> 00:36:22,763
Tou Tou isn't that petty.

669
00:36:24,123 --> 00:36:25,482
But then again,

670
00:36:26,242 --> 00:36:30,043
you are handling
this matter inappropriately.

671
00:36:30,962 --> 00:36:34,242
If someone must administer acupuncture
to Shan Dao in the ICU,

672
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,682
it should be Li Quan, not Tou Tou.

673
00:36:37,922 --> 00:36:39,162
I trust Tou Tou,

674
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:41,323
I don't trust

675
00:36:41,603 --> 00:36:42,403
other people.

676
00:36:44,003 --> 00:36:44,842
Okay then.

677
00:36:45,482 --> 00:36:46,283
I will go.

678
00:36:46,603 --> 00:36:48,563
I will replace Tou Tou, is that okay?

679
00:36:49,083 --> 00:36:49,962
No.

680
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:51,763
You don't trust me either?

681
00:36:52,123 --> 00:36:53,962
It's not that I don't trust you.

682
00:36:54,402 --> 00:36:58,483
Tou Tou is quick-witted and knows
how to handle different situations.

683
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,563
The most important thing
is that she trusts me.

684
00:37:01,682 --> 00:37:02,922
That's crucial.

685
00:37:03,603 --> 00:37:04,603
If you go there,

686
00:37:04,922 --> 00:37:06,283
being a university professor

687
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,242
and the fourteenth-generation successor,

688
00:37:08,323 --> 00:37:09,563
if you don't listen to me,

689
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,039
I won't dare to divorce you, right?

690
00:37:12,843 --> 00:37:13,643
Don't go.

691
00:37:57,763 --> 00:37:58,563
You're awake.

692
00:37:59,162 --> 00:38:00,402
You scared me.

693
00:38:01,482 --> 00:38:02,682
How did I fall asleep?

694
00:38:05,882 --> 00:38:06,682
Tou Tou,

695
00:38:08,803 --> 00:38:09,603
you've worked hard.

696
00:38:12,682 --> 00:38:14,563
How did you know my legs are sore?

697
00:38:15,242 --> 00:38:16,162
You know,

698
00:38:16,603 --> 00:38:17,850
after standing all day long,

699
00:38:18,283 --> 00:38:20,003
my legs really are sore.

700
00:38:20,083 --> 00:38:22,923
I've been trying to please
the nurses in the ICU.

701
00:38:23,003 --> 00:38:24,922
Otherwise, they won't let me in.

702
00:38:26,162 --> 00:38:27,082
I've spent

703
00:38:27,162 --> 00:38:29,402
my entire month's salary
on buying snacks for them,

704
00:38:29,922 --> 00:38:30,962
not a penny left.

705
00:38:31,363 --> 00:38:32,482
I saw everything.

706
00:38:32,843 --> 00:38:33,923
You mopped the floor

707
00:38:34,003 --> 00:38:35,243
and cleaned the toilet.

708
00:38:35,323 --> 00:38:37,243
That's because the caregivers
were not around.

709
00:38:37,323 --> 00:38:38,843
Plus, they were already busy.

710
00:38:39,323 --> 00:38:40,563
I just wanted to help them out,

711
00:38:40,803 --> 00:38:43,123
treating them like Tian Xing Xing
and taking care of them.

712
00:38:44,003 --> 00:38:45,336
Then, I'll take care of you too.

713
00:38:45,642 --> 00:38:48,682
Today, I'll be your exclusive
service provider.

714
00:38:48,882 --> 00:38:50,003
Just enjoy all the services

715
00:38:50,083 --> 00:38:51,482
I provide for you.

716
00:38:51,922 --> 00:38:52,722
What do you say?

717
00:38:54,843 --> 00:38:55,643
I will

718
00:38:56,682 --> 00:38:57,882
enjoy it then.

719
00:39:19,682 --> 00:39:21,455
How many days have you
not washed your feet?

720
00:39:21,763 --> 00:39:22,603
Three days.

721
00:39:23,922 --> 00:39:25,523
And it's already so smelly.

722
00:39:27,283 --> 00:39:28,083
Smell it yourself.

723
00:39:31,537 --> 00:39:32,337
It's not smelly!

724
00:39:32,642 --> 00:39:33,482
Not at...

725
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,520
What are you doing, Ren Tian Zhen?

726
00:39:37,603 --> 00:39:38,646
You're smothering me.

727
00:39:40,563 --> 00:39:42,283
You just touched my feet with your hand.

728
00:39:42,482 --> 00:39:44,162
Ren Tian Zhen, this is so unhygienic.

729
00:39:44,843 --> 00:39:46,322
You're touching my hand with
the hand you used to touch my feet.

730
00:39:46,402 --> 00:39:47,202
You...

731
00:39:47,642 --> 00:39:48,682
What's wrong with you?

732
00:39:52,763 --> 00:39:54,882
We are sharing joys and sorrows.

733
00:39:59,323 --> 00:40:00,603
Disgusting.

734
00:40:00,843 --> 00:40:01,843
You are so disgusting.

735
00:40:02,083 --> 00:40:04,590
All right. I'm going to
get some water to wash your feet.

736
00:40:06,603 --> 00:40:07,562
It's not smelly.

737
00:40:07,642 --> 00:40:09,642
Why do you need water?

738
00:40:14,563 --> 00:40:15,683
It is a little smelly
after I took it off.

739
00:40:15,763 --> 00:40:16,563
Yes.

740
00:40:29,242 --> 00:40:31,323
Guys, come get your cotton pants.

741
00:40:33,083 --> 00:40:34,923
This is such a thick one.
Whose is this?

742
00:40:35,003 --> 00:40:36,203
-I don't know.
-It's mine.

743
00:40:36,283 --> 00:40:37,483
-Mine is grey.
-Here.

744
00:40:37,563 --> 00:40:39,642
I ordered a thicker one.

745
00:40:40,043 --> 00:40:41,523
It has a pound of cotton.
Let me check if it's the right one.

746
00:40:41,603 --> 00:40:42,776
That's right. This is mine.

747
00:40:43,242 --> 00:40:44,683
No one wears cotton pants like that.

748
00:40:44,763 --> 00:40:46,723
It's like going out
with your cotton-filled blanket.

749
00:40:46,803 --> 00:40:49,283
You don't understand.
I'm preparing for pregnancy.

750
00:40:51,363 --> 00:40:53,003
Increased basal body temperature

751
00:40:53,083 --> 00:40:54,650
increases the chances of conception.

752
00:40:54,803 --> 00:40:55,642
Xiao Hong,

753
00:40:56,043 --> 00:40:57,443
you don't even have a boyfriend.

754
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,443
Why are you preparing
for pregnancy every day?

755
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:03,482
Mrs Ren said that preparing for
pregnancy requires constant readiness,

756
00:41:03,563 --> 00:41:05,203
even if you don't have a boyfriend.

757
00:41:05,283 --> 00:41:06,336
I'm going to try this.

758
00:41:16,882 --> 00:41:17,682
Xiao Hong,

759
00:41:18,003 --> 00:41:19,402
you're becoming

760
00:41:19,482 --> 00:41:21,123
more down-to-earth these days.

761
00:41:22,402 --> 00:41:24,133
Do I look like Xiao Fang
from the village?

762
00:41:24,213 --> 00:41:24,763
Yes.

763
00:41:24,843 --> 00:41:26,763
If you tie your hair in braids,
you'll look even more like her.

764
00:41:29,283 --> 00:41:30,083
So pretty.

765
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,908
There are no more
appointments available...

766
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,240
...for Five Elements Acupuncture today.

767
00:41:35,323 --> 00:41:37,242
Those with mental disorders can
come back tomorrow to register.

768
00:41:37,442 --> 00:41:39,122
Rebecca, why do you always

769
00:41:39,202 --> 00:41:41,321
pull a long face when you see me,
as if I was an enemy?

770
00:41:41,402 --> 00:41:43,523
By the way, your dance just now

771
00:41:43,803 --> 00:41:44,682
was really good.

772
00:41:45,962 --> 00:41:48,402
I brought you some food.

773
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,120
I remember you wanted
to maintain your figure,

774
00:41:50,202 --> 00:41:52,426
so I specifically picked
sugar-free yogurt for you.

775
00:41:52,962 --> 00:41:53,762
Come on.

776
00:41:54,123 --> 00:41:55,242
Give me a smile.

777
00:41:55,962 --> 00:41:56,762
Scram.

778
00:41:57,283 --> 00:41:58,202
Xiao Hong,

779
00:41:58,362 --> 00:41:59,882
Peng didn't do anything to you.

780
00:42:00,156 --> 00:42:02,629
Why do you two always end up
fighting whenever you meet?

781
00:42:03,882 --> 00:42:05,356
If you have so much time to spare,

782
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,160
go help out at the pharmacy.

783
00:42:07,482 --> 00:42:09,842
Also, you've been running back
and forth here for the past few days.

784
00:42:09,922 --> 00:42:11,763
The hospital is probably
about to fire you.

785
00:42:13,563 --> 00:42:15,356
Then, you can take me in
and provide for me.

786
00:42:16,642 --> 00:42:18,123
Why are you here again?

787
00:42:18,603 --> 00:42:19,763
Lately, you've been coming here

788
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:22,009
more often than when you pretended
to attend classes.

789
00:42:23,162 --> 00:42:25,075
What's going on with you?
Did you get laid off?

790
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,329
Lay-off your foot!

791
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,400
Xiao Hong...

792
00:42:32,183 --> 00:42:33,782
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

793
00:42:33,863 --> 00:42:35,263
(are referenced from relevant
traditional Chinese medicine books)

794
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:36,520
(Do not use without medical advice)
