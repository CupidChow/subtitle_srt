1
00:01:30,633 --> 00:01:34,531
(Gen Z)

2
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:37,828
(Episode 34)

3
00:01:40,922 --> 00:01:41,322
Come.

4
00:01:41,882 --> 00:01:43,001
Give me a smile.

5
00:01:43,762 --> 00:01:44,161
Go away!

6
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:45,962
Xiao Hong.

7
00:01:46,121 --> 00:01:47,642
Peng doesn't have a grudge against you.

8
00:01:47,922 --> 00:01:50,001
Why must you pick on each other
whenever you meet?

9
00:01:51,642 --> 00:01:53,242
If you're free,

10
00:01:53,242 --> 00:01:55,002
go and help at the pharmacy.

11
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:57,562
Besides, you're here all the time.

12
00:01:57,802 --> 00:01:59,642
I guess they'll fire you.

13
00:02:01,402 --> 00:02:02,521
If that's the case, you support me then.

14
00:02:04,562 --> 00:02:06,082
Why are you here again?

15
00:02:06,482 --> 00:02:07,682
You've been here more often than

16
00:02:07,682 --> 00:02:09,842
when you were
pretending to attend classes.

17
00:02:11,002 --> 00:02:12,561
What's wrong with you?
Were you laid off?

18
00:02:13,202 --> 00:02:14,322
Laid off my foot!

19
00:02:15,881 --> 00:02:16,881
Xiao Hong, here.

20
00:02:17,642 --> 00:02:18,322
I'm not drinking.

21
00:02:18,881 --> 00:02:19,802
Drink it.

22
00:02:20,202 --> 00:02:21,042
I'm not drinking.

23
00:02:21,281 --> 00:02:22,042
Peng.

24
00:02:22,362 --> 00:02:22,842
Peng.

25
00:02:23,522 --> 00:02:24,522
Bring it over since she doesn't want it.

26
00:02:24,721 --> 00:02:25,441
Bring it here.

27
00:02:25,881 --> 00:02:26,642
Bring it here.

28
00:02:29,522 --> 00:02:30,842
Coming!

29
00:02:31,202 --> 00:02:33,721
That's the way. We'll drink, you know.

30
00:02:33,721 --> 00:02:35,002
Come, Ms. Xia.

31
00:02:35,561 --> 00:02:36,642
I'll open it for you.

32
00:02:47,642 --> 00:02:48,682
Tell me.

33
00:02:49,762 --> 00:02:53,521
Is there something wrong
with the feng shui in my house?

34
00:02:54,481 --> 00:02:55,921
First, it was Zhu.

35
00:02:57,082 --> 00:02:58,561
Then, followed by me.

36
00:02:59,881 --> 00:03:00,881
Could it be that

37
00:03:01,362 --> 00:03:02,521
God

38
00:03:03,322 --> 00:03:05,881
wants to take us all away this year?

39
00:03:07,442 --> 00:03:09,682
It is normal to be sick.

40
00:03:10,642 --> 00:03:12,322
Who doesn't get sick?

41
00:03:12,881 --> 00:03:15,561
Besides, cancer

42
00:03:16,201 --> 00:03:18,161
is not an incurable disease.

43
00:03:18,521 --> 00:03:19,841
It is a chronic disease.

44
00:03:22,161 --> 00:03:23,601
I love what you say.

45
00:03:23,841 --> 00:03:27,281
I think it is a chronic disease.

46
00:03:29,122 --> 00:03:30,201
I'll slowly treat it

47
00:03:31,322 --> 00:03:33,161
with Chinese medicine,

48
00:03:33,161 --> 00:03:35,042
take the Chinese medicine
and acupuncture.

49
00:03:43,241 --> 00:03:44,161
But

50
00:03:44,361 --> 00:03:46,762
the doctors want me to have a surgery

51
00:03:47,282 --> 00:03:50,161
to remove my uterus and ovaries.

52
00:03:50,161 --> 00:03:52,001
They said I'm already at this age,

53
00:03:52,001 --> 00:03:53,042
so I don't need to use them anymore.

54
00:03:53,081 --> 00:03:54,641
How could they say that?

55
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:56,001
Once the uterus is removed,

56
00:03:56,001 --> 00:03:57,562
I'll not have estrogen.

57
00:03:57,601 --> 00:03:59,441
Then, I'll become
an old woman in no time.

58
00:03:59,441 --> 00:04:00,801
I don't want to get operated.

59
00:04:03,361 --> 00:04:05,962
Prof. Ren, I trust you.

60
00:04:06,881 --> 00:04:08,601
I choose to get the treatment here.

61
00:04:09,361 --> 00:04:11,521
Can you please keep my uterus?

62
00:04:13,161 --> 00:04:15,521
It is correct for the doctor
to ask you to have surgery.

63
00:04:16,441 --> 00:04:17,881
What's the point of saving the uterus

64
00:04:17,881 --> 00:04:19,601
in your current situation?

65
00:04:21,922 --> 00:04:24,721
Prof. Ren, how could you say that?

66
00:04:25,081 --> 00:04:26,881
You taught us before.

67
00:04:27,001 --> 00:04:28,042
You said that

68
00:04:28,081 --> 00:04:30,441
every organ in our body is precious.

69
00:04:30,441 --> 00:04:33,441
If it is removed,
we can never replace it.

70
00:04:33,721 --> 00:04:36,081
And you said that

71
00:04:36,081 --> 00:04:38,081
we should consider carefully
about getting surgery.

72
00:04:38,521 --> 00:04:40,641
Why are you talking like this today?

73
00:04:42,441 --> 00:04:44,202
When Zhu passed away,

74
00:04:44,202 --> 00:04:46,361
he entrusted our whole family to you.

75
00:04:46,601 --> 00:04:49,001
I even donated
a big sum of money to the center.

76
00:04:49,001 --> 00:04:50,042
How could you leave and

77
00:04:50,042 --> 00:04:51,282
ignore me after receiving the money?

78
00:04:51,601 --> 00:04:52,081
That...

79
00:04:55,282 --> 00:04:56,001
That's not right.

80
00:04:57,441 --> 00:05:00,601
I know you're not that kind of person.

81
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:03,521
Tell me the truth.

82
00:05:03,801 --> 00:05:05,801
Do you think I'm hopeless?

83
00:05:06,801 --> 00:05:07,922
I can take it.

84
00:05:07,922 --> 00:05:09,641
I'm taking the pulse right now.

85
00:05:09,641 --> 00:05:11,441
Please don't talk to me, okay?

86
00:05:19,922 --> 00:05:21,081
I see that you can be saved,

87
00:05:21,081 --> 00:05:23,881
that's why I hope you can
get the surgery at the hospital.

88
00:05:25,361 --> 00:05:26,881
Do you know what kind of person

89
00:05:27,521 --> 00:05:29,161
is suitable for Chinese medicine?

90
00:05:37,001 --> 00:05:37,881
Little monkey.

91
00:05:37,881 --> 00:05:38,682
Come, let's take the medicine.

92
00:05:39,721 --> 00:05:40,521
Thanks.

93
00:05:48,521 --> 00:05:50,682
You're also a fan of Liu?

94
00:05:50,922 --> 00:05:52,602
That's right! I like him!

95
00:05:52,882 --> 00:05:54,081
He's handsome and funny.

96
00:05:54,081 --> 00:05:55,162
When he is dancing,

97
00:05:55,201 --> 00:05:56,602
he is like another person.

98
00:05:56,602 --> 00:05:57,481
I'm falling for him!

99
00:05:59,282 --> 00:06:00,442
Are you his die-hard fan too?

100
00:06:00,521 --> 00:06:02,842
I just followed Tou Tou's request,

101
00:06:02,882 --> 00:06:04,481
to vote for him and watch his videos.

102
00:06:04,722 --> 00:06:06,081
I'm not his die-hard fan.

103
00:06:06,081 --> 00:06:07,882
But I like him though.

104
00:06:08,321 --> 00:06:11,201
So, you're doing it for Tou Tou.

105
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:14,201
She made us all vote for Liu.

106
00:06:14,442 --> 00:06:16,041
Yes, including us, the patients.

107
00:06:16,481 --> 00:06:18,442
Who is it? Who does Tou like?

108
00:06:18,481 --> 00:06:19,321
My idol.

109
00:06:22,321 --> 00:06:23,602
Isn't he Mr. Liu's son?

110
00:06:23,761 --> 00:06:25,201
The kid who likes to sing and dance

111
00:06:25,481 --> 00:06:26,402
but doesn't like studying.

112
00:06:26,442 --> 00:06:27,162
That's right.

113
00:06:27,162 --> 00:06:31,002
He has become very popular after
participating in the street dance show.

114
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:33,442
In the past few weeks, the number of
his votes has been in the top three.

115
00:06:33,442 --> 00:06:35,481
And he also told us that

116
00:06:35,481 --> 00:06:36,761
if he can't win the competition,

117
00:06:36,761 --> 00:06:38,122
he'll return home
and inherit the family business.

118
00:06:38,361 --> 00:06:40,442
We are all doing our best
so that he can win.

119
00:06:40,761 --> 00:06:42,722
You guys too, are my treasure boy's

120
00:06:42,921 --> 00:06:44,041
fans?

121
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:44,801
I know him.

122
00:06:44,801 --> 00:06:46,801
He's a big fan of our center.

123
00:06:47,321 --> 00:06:49,041
Peng, you're wrong.

124
00:06:49,481 --> 00:06:52,002
He's not a fan of our center.

125
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:53,602
He's a fan of Tou Tou.

126
00:06:56,002 --> 00:06:58,201
This is my first time
being so close to my idol.

127
00:06:58,201 --> 00:06:59,081
No wonder he said

128
00:06:59,081 --> 00:07:00,842
his fans are called "saffron".

129
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:02,562
He is so knowledgeable.

130
00:07:03,282 --> 00:07:05,041
Knowing a saffron
consider as knowledgeable?

131
00:07:05,361 --> 00:07:06,761
So, those of us who know
Classic of the Materia Medica

132
00:07:06,761 --> 00:07:08,321
since we're young is known as what?

133
00:07:08,602 --> 00:07:09,521
Don't interrupt.

134
00:07:11,481 --> 00:07:13,842
The girl that
Zi Hong the Treasure Boy likes,

135
00:07:13,842 --> 00:07:15,162
what's her name again?

136
00:07:15,162 --> 00:07:17,002
I'll post breaking news later.

137
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:19,562
Don't talk nonsense.

138
00:07:19,761 --> 00:07:21,361
Tou Tou will not
like such a shallow person.

139
00:07:21,602 --> 00:07:23,081
You're the shallow one, and lonely!

140
00:07:24,201 --> 00:07:26,602
Tian Zhen, have you read
the trending topics?

141
00:07:26,801 --> 00:07:27,402
Trending topics?

142
00:07:28,442 --> 00:07:29,041
Look.

143
00:07:30,282 --> 00:07:30,882
What's wrong?

144
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:35,562
Quickly go and
read the trending topics.

145
00:07:35,921 --> 00:07:37,481
What's trending, Rebecca?

146
00:07:37,801 --> 00:07:38,882
See for yourself.

147
00:07:39,882 --> 00:07:41,481
-Show me.
-Here.

148
00:07:48,002 --> 00:07:48,882
I am a TCM practitioner.

149
00:07:48,882 --> 00:07:51,361
But I respect
Western medicine very much.

150
00:07:51,361 --> 00:07:54,321
Western medicine
is an amazing discipline.

151
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,361
If you have a headache or slight fever,

152
00:07:56,801 --> 00:07:58,641
don't go to the hospital
and stand in line.

153
00:07:58,921 --> 00:08:00,921
Come to me and I'll nurse your body.

154
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:04,081
If you're terminally ill

155
00:08:04,081 --> 00:08:05,361
and the Western medicine
does not accept you anymore,

156
00:08:05,361 --> 00:08:07,041
don't waste the money.

157
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:09,282
Chinese medicine
is responsible for your old age.

158
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:11,602
So, I hope you

159
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:14,002
can go to the hospital for the surgery.

160
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:15,562
Your current condition

161
00:08:15,602 --> 00:08:17,481
is where the Western medicine
is at its best.

162
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:18,962
So, why shouldn't you go?

163
00:08:20,361 --> 00:08:23,081
I'm in what stage now?

164
00:08:26,002 --> 00:08:27,162
Well, it's like this.

165
00:08:27,722 --> 00:08:30,041
Cancer... The cancer cell

166
00:08:30,641 --> 00:08:33,282
is like a car on the highway

167
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,241
and is being chased by the police.

168
00:08:36,361 --> 00:08:37,521
How can the police catch up?

169
00:08:38,521 --> 00:08:40,962
There must be a checkpoint
on the highway.

170
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:45,921
The surgery from Western medicine
is to set a checkpoint for you

171
00:08:47,081 --> 00:08:48,602
so that you can catch it.

172
00:08:51,921 --> 00:08:52,481
How about this?

173
00:08:54,081 --> 00:08:55,722
After your surgery,

174
00:08:55,761 --> 00:08:57,481
I'll be in charge
of cleaning up for you.

175
00:08:59,201 --> 00:09:01,921
So, for my condition,
how long will it take to clean it up?

176
00:09:02,201 --> 00:09:04,962
Think about this.
You've had the bad living habits

177
00:09:05,761 --> 00:09:07,041
for so long.

178
00:09:07,882 --> 00:09:09,282
So, to clean up

179
00:09:09,921 --> 00:09:11,442
requires a long time.

180
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:16,282
So, according to you,

181
00:09:16,921 --> 00:09:18,641
I still can live for many years?

182
00:09:19,201 --> 00:09:20,521
I took your pulse.

183
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:22,682
Yours is the longevity pulse.
No problem.

184
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:24,041
No way.

185
00:09:24,321 --> 00:09:26,562
I have cancer, how can I live long?

186
00:09:26,921 --> 00:09:29,602
Prof. Ren, you're
not trying to comfort me, are you?

187
00:09:29,882 --> 00:09:32,321
There are people
with cancer who live a longer life.

188
00:09:32,801 --> 00:09:34,641
Those who live until 100 years old
without any diseases and calamities,

189
00:09:34,842 --> 00:09:36,402
they have the fate of the gods.

190
00:09:36,602 --> 00:09:38,602
You and I are mortal

191
00:09:39,081 --> 00:09:40,602
who eat whole grains.

192
00:09:40,921 --> 00:09:42,162
We'll surely fall sick.

193
00:09:45,321 --> 00:09:46,602
I don't understand now.

194
00:09:46,602 --> 00:09:48,921
Do you want to die or live?

195
00:09:49,761 --> 00:09:51,682
If you really miss...

196
00:09:51,921 --> 00:09:53,442
If you miss Zhu...

197
00:09:53,481 --> 00:09:54,002
Well...

198
00:09:54,321 --> 00:09:54,761
I...

199
00:09:55,002 --> 00:09:56,282
No, I don't miss him.

200
00:09:56,282 --> 00:09:58,481
I want to live.

201
00:10:00,602 --> 00:10:03,162
That's why I suggested you to do this.

202
00:10:03,162 --> 00:10:06,122
It's not
because Zhu entrusted you to me.

203
00:10:06,122 --> 00:10:09,802
It's also not because
you donated money to the center.

204
00:10:11,482 --> 00:10:13,242
It's because of me,

205
00:10:13,282 --> 00:10:15,602
as a doctor with a conscience.

206
00:10:20,282 --> 00:10:23,482
I will entrust you
to a very good friend of mine.

207
00:10:23,842 --> 00:10:25,242
He is the best in the country

208
00:10:25,802 --> 00:10:27,362
in this field.

209
00:10:29,121 --> 00:10:30,402
When he completes the surgery,

210
00:10:31,042 --> 00:10:31,761
come to me again.

211
00:10:34,602 --> 00:10:35,561
What if...

212
00:10:36,121 --> 00:10:38,042
What if the surgery fails?

213
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:40,282
You said "what if".

214
00:10:40,922 --> 00:10:42,602
That means, it may or may not happen.

215
00:10:42,602 --> 00:10:43,722
Why do you think it may happen to you?

216
00:10:45,362 --> 00:10:45,922
Go now.

217
00:10:47,802 --> 00:10:48,722
You must believe in science.

218
00:10:51,602 --> 00:10:54,121
You said we shouldn't believe in science.

219
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:55,482
You said science

220
00:10:55,482 --> 00:10:58,001
isn't the only ruler in this world.

221
00:10:58,001 --> 00:11:00,641
I listened carefully
to that lecture video of yours.

222
00:11:01,282 --> 00:11:03,802
What I meant was,
don't be superstitious.

223
00:11:03,802 --> 00:11:05,641
Don't be superstitious about anything.

224
00:11:05,922 --> 00:11:07,282
You must have the right belief.

225
00:11:09,841 --> 00:11:11,958
(Trending Topics. 1. Meng Meng day)
(2. Penalties on Zhang Jia Nan)

226
00:11:12,242 --> 00:11:14,042
Fired. He should be fired.

227
00:11:14,402 --> 00:11:16,321
This kind of person should not be alive.

228
00:11:16,602 --> 00:11:17,881
And they reported his real name.

229
00:11:17,881 --> 00:11:18,962
Even the Ministry of Education
has given the statement.

230
00:11:19,162 --> 00:11:20,561
He's doomed for sure.

231
00:11:23,802 --> 00:11:25,282
He is a scum. He deserved this.

232
00:11:25,482 --> 00:11:27,842
Well done.
He should be embarrassed publicly.

233
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:30,201
Too bad about the girl.

234
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,600
(The beginning of winter means
the beginning of the storage of energy.)

235
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,800
(Everything enters
a state of rest and recuperation.)

236
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,760
(It is a time to enjoy the harvest

237
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:22,320
and to rest and recuperate.)

238
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:31,041
(The beginning of winter)

239
00:12:46,121 --> 00:12:46,722
Mom.

240
00:12:47,561 --> 00:12:49,162
I've applied for a leave.
I'm going to the hospital.

241
00:12:50,042 --> 00:12:50,842
You're just in time.

242
00:12:51,162 --> 00:12:53,802
Bring along these sachets.

243
00:12:54,042 --> 00:12:55,722
Let Tou Tou, Xing Xing

244
00:12:55,722 --> 00:12:59,242
and Shen Xin keep this with them.

245
00:13:00,242 --> 00:13:01,561
You can give it to anyone who needs it.

246
00:13:01,561 --> 00:13:03,042
Well, the flu season coming, you know.

247
00:13:03,042 --> 00:13:04,242
Okay, no problem.

248
00:13:04,282 --> 00:13:05,162
And...

249
00:13:05,602 --> 00:13:08,362
Tell Tou Tou
not to do acupuncture first.

250
00:13:08,681 --> 00:13:11,042
Your dad and I will go at noon.
We'll have lunch together.

251
00:13:11,482 --> 00:13:13,402
After your dad has checked on him,

252
00:13:13,402 --> 00:13:15,242
we'll decide on the next treatment plan.

253
00:13:15,282 --> 00:13:16,242
Alright, Mom. Leave it to me.

254
00:13:44,521 --> 00:13:46,201
You're still here.

255
00:13:47,042 --> 00:13:48,722
Put this on.

256
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:51,802
My mom said my dad is coming at noon.

257
00:13:52,121 --> 00:13:53,402
He may want
to adjust the treatment plan.

258
00:13:56,362 --> 00:13:57,402
Let me tell you.

259
00:13:57,402 --> 00:13:59,482
His reaction
to the needle is getting better.

260
00:13:59,482 --> 00:14:01,242
When the doctor came
to check on him this morning,

261
00:14:01,282 --> 00:14:03,881
there was a response
when he touched his feet.

262
00:14:04,242 --> 00:14:04,922
Really?

263
00:14:05,722 --> 00:14:06,282
That's very good.

264
00:14:10,121 --> 00:14:11,321
Don't hang things in the ward.

265
00:14:11,321 --> 00:14:12,081
It's not allowed.

266
00:14:13,402 --> 00:14:13,842
Okay.

267
00:14:19,722 --> 00:14:20,722
Let me tell you.

268
00:14:21,162 --> 00:14:23,362
I want to give the uncle
next door acupuncture too.

269
00:14:23,802 --> 00:14:25,282
His wife has begged me for days.

270
00:14:25,282 --> 00:14:26,402
Don't mess around.

271
00:14:27,042 --> 00:14:28,722
You do the acupuncture on Senior Uncle

272
00:14:29,162 --> 00:14:31,042
under the guidance of my dad.

273
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:32,402
You can't take matters
into your own hands.

274
00:14:35,842 --> 00:14:36,681
One more year.

275
00:14:36,922 --> 00:14:38,802
I'll be able to catch up
with you in a year.

276
00:14:41,242 --> 00:14:43,922
You're finally going to be on my level.

277
00:14:43,922 --> 00:14:44,922
No.

278
00:14:45,042 --> 00:14:47,042
According to our seniority,
I'm still your senior.

279
00:14:47,042 --> 00:14:48,441
You have to call me "grandpa".

280
00:14:48,482 --> 00:14:50,042
Tou Tou, I'm going back now.

281
00:14:50,042 --> 00:14:51,282
If there's anything,
you can call the nurse.

282
00:14:51,561 --> 00:14:52,362
Thanks a lot.

283
00:14:52,362 --> 00:14:53,602
Thank you. Be careful.

284
00:15:00,402 --> 00:15:02,922
Grandpa, let me
tell you something great.

285
00:15:02,922 --> 00:15:04,081
Do you want to know about it?

286
00:15:04,121 --> 00:15:05,162
Zhang Jia Nan

287
00:15:05,602 --> 00:15:07,162
is on trending topics.
I know about it.

288
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:09,602
Did you

289
00:15:09,962 --> 00:15:11,602
take good care of Senior Uncle here?

290
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:13,561
Is there anything out there
that you don't know?

291
00:15:13,561 --> 00:15:15,602
I want to take good care of him.

292
00:15:15,602 --> 00:15:17,001
But look at him now.

293
00:15:17,402 --> 00:15:18,602
What else can I do?

294
00:15:23,842 --> 00:15:26,561
I should've let Zhu Xia and
Jian Xi to come and visit him.

295
00:15:27,922 --> 00:15:28,922
It's a blessing

296
00:15:29,922 --> 00:15:30,722
to be able to take care of them.

297
00:15:31,962 --> 00:15:33,162
This is what I'm most afraid of

298
00:15:41,042 --> 00:15:41,802
Let's go out for a walk.

299
00:15:42,722 --> 00:15:43,282
Let's go.

300
00:16:06,162 --> 00:16:07,162
Let's go.

301
00:16:11,121 --> 00:16:12,162
Shouldn't we go out for a walk?

302
00:16:12,162 --> 00:16:13,602
Why are you playing on your phone?

303
00:16:13,842 --> 00:16:15,321
This is what I meant.

304
00:16:20,242 --> 00:16:22,042
Senior Uncle won't wake up for a while.

305
00:16:22,042 --> 00:16:23,362
We'll just have a stroll
for a few minutes.

306
00:16:23,722 --> 00:16:24,641
I have to keep close to him.

307
00:16:25,802 --> 00:16:26,761
Do you have to go that far?

308
00:16:27,482 --> 00:16:28,441
That's what your dad said.

309
00:16:29,282 --> 00:16:30,482
My dad isn't here.

310
00:16:30,482 --> 00:16:32,761
No one will know
if we go out for a few minutes.

311
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,520
(Senior Uncle has woken up! Thank God!)

312
00:16:37,962 --> 00:16:39,321
Senior Uncle has woken up?

313
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:42,042
Tou Tou, what does this mean?

314
00:16:47,602 --> 00:16:48,962
I'd like to deceive Zhao Li Quan.

315
00:16:49,602 --> 00:16:50,402
Li Quan?

316
00:16:53,042 --> 00:16:53,842
What's with him?

317
00:16:54,842 --> 00:16:57,282
I think he had something to do
with what happened to Senior Uncle.

318
00:16:57,922 --> 00:16:58,922
How is he related to this?

319
00:16:59,681 --> 00:17:01,162
Every time Zhao Li Quan
comes and visits him,

320
00:17:01,282 --> 00:17:03,162
his blood pressure will go up.

321
00:17:03,482 --> 00:17:06,482
But his pressure isn't that high
when Granny Wu and Ms. Shen visit him.

322
00:17:06,482 --> 00:17:07,602
Don't you think it's strange?

323
00:17:09,162 --> 00:17:10,881
Senior Uncle likes Li Quan very much.

324
00:17:10,922 --> 00:17:12,121
So, it's normal for him
to have this reaction.

325
00:17:12,121 --> 00:17:13,042
This is not normal.

326
00:17:14,482 --> 00:17:16,761
I don't think this is a normal reaction.

327
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,001
Don't speculate about things
you don't have proof of.

328
00:17:21,602 --> 00:17:22,602
It's my intuition.

329
00:17:25,121 --> 00:17:26,162
The Chinese medicine's intuition.

330
00:17:45,402 --> 00:17:46,282
My intuition is wrong.

331
00:17:47,681 --> 00:17:48,402
What now?

332
00:17:50,802 --> 00:17:53,042
I thought the first person
to reply or feel happy

333
00:17:53,042 --> 00:17:53,962
should be Zhao Li Quan.

334
00:17:54,802 --> 00:17:56,602
But he didn't respond at all.

335
00:17:59,802 --> 00:18:01,681
Sometimes intuition is inaccurate.

336
00:18:08,722 --> 00:18:09,922
Hello, Ling Lan.

337
00:18:11,081 --> 00:18:14,402
Someone sent a huge bouquet and a cake.

338
00:18:15,121 --> 00:18:16,362
Did you order these?

339
00:18:17,482 --> 00:18:18,521
(They've arrived?)

340
00:18:18,561 --> 00:18:20,962
Did the flowers
and the cake come together?

341
00:18:21,722 --> 00:18:22,922
Look at you.

342
00:18:23,482 --> 00:18:26,242
Your dad can't eat sweet food now.

343
00:18:26,282 --> 00:18:27,962
I must let him control his sugar intake.

344
00:18:27,962 --> 00:18:29,802
(Don't you want him to live?)

345
00:18:31,162 --> 00:18:34,561
Mom, today is my big day.

346
00:18:34,602 --> 00:18:36,121
What big day for you?

347
00:18:36,681 --> 00:18:38,722
Today is me and Xin Zheng's

348
00:18:38,722 --> 00:18:41,842
30th wedding anniversary.

349
00:18:44,921 --> 00:18:46,201
Oh, my God!

350
00:18:48,081 --> 00:18:50,882
Look. I've been thinking
about Shan Dao's issue

351
00:18:51,081 --> 00:18:53,681
that I forgot such an important thing.

352
00:18:53,962 --> 00:18:56,441
(Yes, we should celebrate this.)

353
00:18:56,441 --> 00:18:57,201
It's alright.

354
00:18:58,081 --> 00:19:00,801
The cake I ordered
is a sugar-free tofu cake.

355
00:19:00,801 --> 00:19:01,842
(Dad can eat.)

356
00:19:02,602 --> 00:19:03,642
I see.

357
00:19:05,081 --> 00:19:06,081
Gosh, what should I do?

358
00:19:06,081 --> 00:19:08,602
There're no ingredients at home.

359
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:11,281
It's okay. I'll order some online.

360
00:19:12,321 --> 00:19:12,722
No need for that.

361
00:19:13,561 --> 00:19:15,681
I told Zhu Xia to go over and cook.

362
00:19:15,962 --> 00:19:17,522
She cooks very well.

363
00:19:18,201 --> 00:19:20,642
Well, I mainly
want to give her some money.

364
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:21,962
Alright.

365
00:19:22,281 --> 00:19:25,401
But Zhu Xia will not take your money.

366
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:27,201
But this is different.

367
00:19:27,201 --> 00:19:28,201
This is a happy occasion.

368
00:19:28,561 --> 00:19:30,401
We must share happiness.

369
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:34,041
But I can't give her the money.

370
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:34,962
(You give her.)

371
00:19:35,441 --> 00:19:37,161
(I've prepared the red packet.)

372
00:19:37,201 --> 00:19:39,842
(It's on
the dressing table in your room.)

373
00:19:40,801 --> 00:19:42,161
If you give it to her, she will take it.

374
00:19:43,441 --> 00:19:44,441
Alright.

375
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:49,201
My dear daughter, look at you.

376
00:19:49,762 --> 00:19:51,201
You're thoughtful

377
00:19:51,561 --> 00:19:53,962
in doing things now.

378
00:19:54,561 --> 00:19:57,561
(Be it the household or the center,)

379
00:19:57,561 --> 00:19:59,882
you arranged well.

380
00:20:00,081 --> 00:20:01,882
I'm happy for you.

381
00:20:05,681 --> 00:20:07,801
But I want to ask you this.

382
00:20:08,201 --> 00:20:09,842
Does the male protagonist

383
00:20:09,842 --> 00:20:12,362
(remember this special day?)

384
00:20:14,801 --> 00:20:16,201
If I'm not mistaken,

385
00:20:16,842 --> 00:20:18,081
he does not remember this.

386
00:20:20,081 --> 00:20:22,602
But as long as he shows up,

387
00:20:22,842 --> 00:20:23,962
I'll consider that he has cooperated.

388
00:20:25,482 --> 00:20:26,401
Okay.

389
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:30,921
Well, ask Tian Zhen
and Tou Tou to come back early.

390
00:20:31,362 --> 00:20:32,482
Tou Tou can't go home.

391
00:20:32,681 --> 00:20:34,161
Her master put her on duty.

392
00:20:34,201 --> 00:20:36,081
It's a big deal for her.

393
00:20:36,681 --> 00:20:37,801
Just our own family.

394
00:20:40,441 --> 00:20:41,201
Alright.

395
00:20:43,441 --> 00:20:43,962
Goodbye.

396
00:20:56,962 --> 00:20:58,321
My god.

397
00:20:59,201 --> 00:21:02,081
My daughter
has been married for 30 years.

398
00:21:07,293 --> 00:21:10,136
(Jiangzhou People's Hospital)

399
00:21:10,801 --> 00:21:12,321
He didn't reply to the message.

400
00:21:12,441 --> 00:21:14,041
Is it because he is at work?

401
00:21:14,281 --> 00:21:16,281
You really think
of yourself as Detective Conan?

402
00:21:16,561 --> 00:21:17,842
You're thinking too much.

403
00:21:18,321 --> 00:21:19,681
If Li Quan had not been there,

404
00:21:19,921 --> 00:21:21,441
Senior Uncle would have not been here.

405
00:21:21,602 --> 00:21:24,081
Luckily, he went there early
and found out about Senior Uncle.

406
00:21:24,081 --> 00:21:25,441
If he had been late,

407
00:21:25,441 --> 00:21:27,561
you would have no chance
of trying to save him.

408
00:21:27,561 --> 00:21:29,161
Senior Uncle knows about it.

409
00:21:29,201 --> 00:21:30,362
Perhaps he is feeling grateful

410
00:21:30,362 --> 00:21:32,321
and that made
his blood pressure goes up.

411
00:21:32,321 --> 00:21:33,561
That's not right.

412
00:21:35,321 --> 00:21:36,962
Zhao Li Quan lied to us.

413
00:21:37,081 --> 00:21:38,281
He went to see Senior Uncle before.

414
00:21:38,281 --> 00:21:39,842
When he went there,
Senior Uncle was fine.

415
00:21:39,842 --> 00:21:40,762
Someone can testify to this.

416
00:21:41,722 --> 00:21:42,801
So, I guess that

417
00:21:43,081 --> 00:21:43,921
when he went there,

418
00:21:45,201 --> 00:21:46,321
Senior Uncle was alright.

419
00:21:47,321 --> 00:21:49,681
And Senior Uncle
collapsed in front of him.

420
00:21:50,962 --> 00:21:52,801
But when I asked him, he hesitated.

421
00:21:53,921 --> 00:21:55,281
He even wanted to brush me off.

422
00:21:56,561 --> 00:21:57,441
That's the weird part.

423
00:21:59,681 --> 00:22:02,002
Why didn't you tell me
such an important thing?

424
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:03,081
How long have you known this?

425
00:22:04,081 --> 00:22:05,081
I told your dad.

426
00:22:06,842 --> 00:22:08,722
Shouldn't you tell me first?

427
00:22:09,842 --> 00:22:11,801
Well, I should tell my master first.

428
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:13,201
He is your master.

429
00:22:13,362 --> 00:22:14,722
I am your husband.

430
00:22:15,161 --> 00:22:17,201
The two of us are
going to live together forever.

431
00:22:17,482 --> 00:22:19,561
How about this? Can we make a rule?

432
00:22:19,842 --> 00:22:22,201
Discuss important things with me first.

433
00:22:22,201 --> 00:22:22,962
No.

434
00:22:22,962 --> 00:22:25,041
I should tell my master first
about the important things.

435
00:22:28,362 --> 00:22:29,242
In your heart,

436
00:22:29,921 --> 00:22:31,561
is your husband

437
00:22:31,561 --> 00:22:32,482
or master important?

438
00:22:32,482 --> 00:22:33,281
Master is important.

439
00:22:40,962 --> 00:22:42,281
I'm thinking things.

440
00:22:42,281 --> 00:22:43,441
Hey, are you sick?

441
00:22:43,441 --> 00:22:44,962
Why are you jealous of your dad?

442
00:22:44,962 --> 00:22:46,201
I'm not being jealous.

443
00:22:46,722 --> 00:22:48,401
Jealousy is
when we do that to our competitors.

444
00:22:48,441 --> 00:22:51,321
Mine is
petty love competing with great love.

445
00:22:51,801 --> 00:22:53,281
In front of Chinese medicine,

446
00:22:53,962 --> 00:22:55,081
I am nothing.

447
00:22:55,842 --> 00:22:58,561
You put
the position of inheritor before me.

448
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:06,321
You're really your mom's son.

449
00:23:06,722 --> 00:23:08,321
Your mom fought
with your dad all her life

450
00:23:08,962 --> 00:23:10,242
because of this issue too.

451
00:23:14,842 --> 00:23:15,362
Quan!

452
00:23:21,201 --> 00:23:22,161
Mr. Wu is awake?

453
00:23:23,962 --> 00:23:24,441
How is he?

454
00:23:24,441 --> 00:23:26,561
Did you guard at the hospital?

455
00:23:26,561 --> 00:23:27,722
How did you get here so fast?

456
00:23:27,722 --> 00:23:29,321
I came when I saw your message.

457
00:23:30,561 --> 00:23:31,842
-Can he talk?
-Yes.

458
00:23:32,482 --> 00:23:33,561
What did he say?

459
00:23:34,441 --> 00:23:34,921
He said...

460
00:23:37,362 --> 00:23:38,281
"Li Quan."

461
00:23:41,602 --> 00:23:43,002
"Li Quan, he..."

462
00:23:44,722 --> 00:23:45,561
"He..."

463
00:23:47,842 --> 00:23:49,122
That's all. Then, he went on sleeping.

464
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:50,681
He just said that.

465
00:23:50,681 --> 00:23:52,081
Mr. Wu misses me. I have to go see him.

466
00:23:52,081 --> 00:23:52,842
Zhao Li Quan!

467
00:23:52,842 --> 00:23:54,081
Wait a minute! No.

468
00:23:54,962 --> 00:23:55,842
You can't go in.

469
00:23:56,681 --> 00:23:57,681
Why can't I go in?

470
00:23:57,681 --> 00:23:58,522
Well, just now,

471
00:23:58,522 --> 00:24:01,201
I was kicked out by the nurse.

472
00:24:01,201 --> 00:24:03,201
She said I affected his rest.

473
00:24:03,602 --> 00:24:05,482
And when he said "Li Quan",

474
00:24:05,482 --> 00:24:06,681
his blood pressure went up.

475
00:24:07,561 --> 00:24:09,002
We don't know why.

476
00:24:16,801 --> 00:24:18,441
Quan, don't worry.

477
00:24:18,801 --> 00:24:21,281
Since Senior Uncle is awake,
he will get better soon.

478
00:24:21,321 --> 00:24:22,561
You'll see him sooner or later.

479
00:24:23,201 --> 00:24:24,441
Don't rush over it.

480
00:24:26,081 --> 00:24:27,842
No, I must see him.

481
00:24:28,321 --> 00:24:29,242
You can't go in.

482
00:24:30,561 --> 00:24:31,962
Master has told Chief Physician Li that

483
00:24:32,201 --> 00:24:34,441
anyone who wants to enter the ward
has to get his consent.

484
00:24:34,842 --> 00:24:37,081
If you want to go in,
you should call and ask Master.

485
00:24:38,801 --> 00:24:40,842
Does that include
Mrs. Wu and his mother?

486
00:24:45,801 --> 00:24:46,362
Quan.

487
00:28:26,321 --> 00:28:27,161
Ren, how is he?

488
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:29,842
He is still weak.

489
00:28:32,201 --> 00:28:33,482
Looks like

490
00:28:35,161 --> 00:28:36,321
he will have enough sleep this time.

491
00:28:37,921 --> 00:28:39,842
Let him have a good rest.

492
00:28:39,962 --> 00:28:42,081
Let's try not to disturb him.

493
00:28:42,441 --> 00:28:43,842
Okay, okay.

494
00:28:44,441 --> 00:28:46,201
As long as he is fine.

495
00:28:46,362 --> 00:28:46,882
That's right.

496
00:28:47,681 --> 00:28:49,002
As long as he is fine.

497
00:28:51,921 --> 00:28:53,041
Shan Dao.

498
00:28:53,281 --> 00:28:55,041
You listen to me since you were a child.

499
00:28:55,962 --> 00:28:57,842
You have never let me down.

500
00:28:59,041 --> 00:29:02,561
I believe that this time,
you will make it.

501
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:09,281
Try harder

502
00:29:10,441 --> 00:29:11,681
and have a good rest.

503
00:29:12,842 --> 00:29:13,762
Tomorrow,

504
00:29:14,722 --> 00:29:17,041
you can help me
do the grocery shopping again.

505
00:29:26,921 --> 00:29:28,801
Thank you, Ren. Thank you.

506
00:29:29,962 --> 00:29:31,441
Thank you.

507
00:29:31,681 --> 00:29:32,321
Tou Tou.

508
00:29:32,561 --> 00:29:33,561
Thank you

509
00:29:33,681 --> 00:29:34,722
for taking care of him

510
00:29:35,681 --> 00:29:37,122
during this period.

511
00:29:38,161 --> 00:29:39,962
Thank you so much.

512
00:29:41,842 --> 00:29:43,642
Tou Tou, come here.

513
00:29:44,201 --> 00:29:47,081
Let me tell you
about the treatment after this.

514
00:30:01,081 --> 00:30:03,201
Tell me. Why did you lie?

515
00:30:09,921 --> 00:30:11,362
You really know everything.

516
00:30:12,081 --> 00:30:13,561
Otherwise, how can I be your master?

517
00:30:20,722 --> 00:30:21,441
I'm sorry.

518
00:30:24,602 --> 00:30:27,482
Just now, you have seen Granny Wu

519
00:30:28,321 --> 00:30:29,681
and Ms. Shen's expression.

520
00:30:29,681 --> 00:30:30,722
What do you have in mind?

521
00:30:35,321 --> 00:30:36,002
I was wrong.

522
00:30:39,561 --> 00:30:41,681
I know you want
to deceive Zhao Li Quan.

523
00:30:42,842 --> 00:30:44,482
You want to figure things out.

524
00:30:45,561 --> 00:30:47,401
If it's as you expected,

525
00:30:47,441 --> 00:30:49,482
it's Zhao Li Quan who
wanted to harm your Senior Uncle

526
00:30:50,722 --> 00:30:52,842
and he doesn't have a good reason,

527
00:30:53,362 --> 00:30:54,281
can what you do right now

528
00:30:55,321 --> 00:30:56,441
wake him up?

529
00:30:59,321 --> 00:31:00,681
Granny Wu is over 80 years old.

530
00:31:01,561 --> 00:31:02,962
When you saw the look in her eyes,

531
00:31:03,962 --> 00:31:05,081
have you thought about the consequences?

532
00:31:07,081 --> 00:31:07,962
I'm asking you.

533
00:31:10,842 --> 00:31:12,161
I was wrong, Master.

534
00:31:12,962 --> 00:31:14,362
That's all you'll say.

535
00:31:18,321 --> 00:31:19,642
Why are you pouting?

536
00:31:24,161 --> 00:31:26,842
Anyway, I know
it was Zhao Li Quan who did it.

537
00:31:27,362 --> 00:31:29,441
And Zhao Li Quan knows that
I know that he did it.

538
00:31:31,161 --> 00:31:32,921
Are you doing a tongue twister for me?

539
00:31:33,962 --> 00:31:35,041
You said this before.

540
00:31:36,201 --> 00:31:37,681
Feelings are the windows to the soul.

541
00:31:37,842 --> 00:31:38,762
I just know it.

542
00:31:44,801 --> 00:31:45,681
Tou Tou.

543
00:31:47,321 --> 00:31:48,722
We won't let a bad guy go,

544
00:31:48,722 --> 00:31:50,842
but we can't wrong a good man.

545
00:31:52,962 --> 00:31:54,242
A doctor's job...

546
00:31:54,522 --> 00:31:57,122
Your job
is to heal the sick and save the sick.

547
00:31:58,321 --> 00:32:00,161
But what is your priority?

548
00:32:01,441 --> 00:32:03,842
It is to ensure
the safety of the patient's life.

549
00:32:04,962 --> 00:32:06,561
With this lie of yours,

550
00:32:07,321 --> 00:32:09,801
Chief Physician Li got off the
operating table and rushed over here.

551
00:32:10,362 --> 00:32:11,642
He is the attending physician.

552
00:32:12,962 --> 00:32:14,722
Can you hold on to this lie?

553
00:32:15,482 --> 00:32:17,041
And this has directly affected
the subsequent treatment.

554
00:32:22,281 --> 00:32:22,962
Master.

555
00:32:25,441 --> 00:32:26,681
What should I do then?

556
00:32:30,681 --> 00:32:32,642
You're usually high-spirited.

557
00:32:34,201 --> 00:32:35,201
Why are you listless now?

558
00:32:36,602 --> 00:32:38,122
Have I made no progress at all?

559
00:32:38,161 --> 00:32:39,561
-What do you think?
-Yes, I have not.

560
00:32:43,321 --> 00:32:44,081
Tou Tou.

561
00:32:44,842 --> 00:32:47,002
You have good intentions.

562
00:32:47,041 --> 00:32:49,081
You want to do something for Shan Dao

563
00:32:49,081 --> 00:32:50,561
and you're doing pretty well.

564
00:32:50,962 --> 00:32:52,081
I asked you to stay by his side

565
00:32:52,561 --> 00:32:53,962
and you have never left him.

566
00:32:55,081 --> 00:32:57,482
Sometimes, the intentions are good.

567
00:32:57,482 --> 00:32:59,561
But you can't ignore the consequences.

568
00:32:59,842 --> 00:33:00,962
If you do a good thing,
you should be praised.

569
00:33:01,321 --> 00:33:02,401
If you do a bad thing,
you must be criticized.

570
00:33:04,962 --> 00:33:06,281
But I'm always like this.

571
00:33:06,281 --> 00:33:07,801
I don't consider the consequences.

572
00:33:08,962 --> 00:33:09,561
Master.

573
00:33:10,482 --> 00:33:12,122
What...

574
00:33:12,482 --> 00:33:13,362
What should I do then?

575
00:33:14,921 --> 00:33:17,321
If Senior Uncle can't wake up,

576
00:33:17,321 --> 00:33:19,801
Granny Wu and Ms. Shen...

577
00:33:22,362 --> 00:33:23,882
They're all looking forward to...

578
00:33:24,801 --> 00:33:25,321
I...

579
00:33:32,161 --> 00:33:32,722
Alright.

580
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:36,962
I'm still here.

581
00:33:39,201 --> 00:33:40,921
Your apprenticeship
hasn't been completed yet, right?

582
00:33:42,321 --> 00:33:45,161
Even if there's a huge mistake,
you'll not be punished.

583
00:33:46,321 --> 00:33:47,081
I'll be punished.

584
00:33:49,441 --> 00:33:51,242
Why do people need a master?

585
00:33:51,281 --> 00:33:52,801
That's to take the blame for you.

586
00:33:59,081 --> 00:34:00,602
Can you really do it?

587
00:34:01,041 --> 00:34:02,921
Otherwise, how can I be your master?

588
00:34:04,081 --> 00:34:04,522
Alright.

589
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:08,482
Let's go back.

590
00:34:09,681 --> 00:34:10,281
Let's go.

591
00:34:20,962 --> 00:34:21,722
Grandma.

592
00:34:22,041 --> 00:34:23,482
There are wine and cake here.

593
00:34:23,801 --> 00:34:25,362
What day is it today
that the dinner is so grand?

594
00:34:26,081 --> 00:34:27,161
A big day.

595
00:34:28,962 --> 00:34:30,441
No one in our family
is celebrating a birthday today.

596
00:34:30,681 --> 00:34:31,602
What day is it?

597
00:34:34,482 --> 00:34:36,602
Today is your parents'

598
00:34:36,602 --> 00:34:39,201
30th wedding anniversary.

599
00:34:39,842 --> 00:34:40,561
Today?

600
00:34:47,482 --> 00:34:49,081
Why are you playing on your phone?

601
00:34:50,281 --> 00:34:51,842
Gosh, you're...

602
00:34:51,842 --> 00:34:53,441
Mom, we're home.

603
00:34:53,681 --> 00:34:54,482
You're home.

604
00:34:59,482 --> 00:35:00,602
What day is it today?

605
00:35:02,081 --> 00:35:04,762
Wedding anniversary.

606
00:35:06,642 --> 00:35:07,561
Wedding...

607
00:35:07,561 --> 00:35:08,882
Dad.

608
00:35:08,921 --> 00:35:10,362
Forget about it.

609
00:35:11,561 --> 00:35:14,002
If he remembers what day it is today,

610
00:35:14,041 --> 00:35:15,842
that will be scary.

611
00:35:17,561 --> 00:35:20,482
It's been 30 years and I'm used to it.

612
00:35:21,041 --> 00:35:23,281
I've completed the tasks you gave me.

613
00:35:23,441 --> 00:35:24,441
Thanks, Mom.

614
00:35:24,962 --> 00:35:27,201
Wedding anniversary.

615
00:35:27,801 --> 00:35:28,842
We don't celebrate it.

616
00:35:29,842 --> 00:35:31,561
We look like we're newlyweds every day.

617
00:35:31,842 --> 00:35:33,921
Mom, we celebrate
the wedding anniversary every day.

618
00:35:34,081 --> 00:35:36,002
-So, he remembers it.
-I remember.

619
00:35:36,002 --> 00:35:38,161
Mom, do you believe him? Gosh.

620
00:35:38,602 --> 00:35:40,882
Dad, it turns out you can talk so well.

621
00:35:40,962 --> 00:35:41,801
Now only you know about it.

622
00:35:42,122 --> 00:35:44,641
This is a man's survival instinct.

623
00:36:09,121 --> 00:36:09,962
Do you know?

624
00:36:10,121 --> 00:36:13,601
Xing Xing said
Mr. Wang that she took care of...

625
00:36:14,082 --> 00:36:14,722
What happened to him?

626
00:36:14,802 --> 00:36:16,282
He wanted to come back.

627
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:18,121
-He wanted to come back?
-That's right.

628
00:36:18,722 --> 00:36:20,121
He had been admitted for a long time.

629
00:36:21,482 --> 00:36:22,722
Gosh.

630
00:36:23,322 --> 00:36:24,722
I guess he's used to it.

631
00:36:25,401 --> 00:36:26,722
What an excuse!

632
00:36:27,242 --> 00:36:29,201
It's always better
to stay at home than in the hospital.

633
00:36:46,482 --> 00:36:47,282
Grandpa.

634
00:36:47,562 --> 00:36:48,601
Just to be clear.

635
00:36:48,601 --> 00:36:50,562
This wine is good,
but you can't drink too much.

636
00:36:59,042 --> 00:36:59,601
Grandma.

637
00:37:03,121 --> 00:37:03,921
Thank you, son.

638
00:37:05,841 --> 00:37:06,881
Alright, it's my turn.

639
00:37:10,042 --> 00:37:10,601
Okay.

640
00:37:11,361 --> 00:37:12,881
Hurry up. Your dad wants to speak.

641
00:37:13,002 --> 00:37:14,002
Okay, right away.

642
00:37:14,681 --> 00:37:16,082
Come on. I'm ready.

643
00:37:17,722 --> 00:37:19,802
Dad, Mom.

644
00:37:20,641 --> 00:37:22,601
Master, Mrs. Song.

645
00:37:22,641 --> 00:37:25,681
The first toast
is for the two of you, my elders.

646
00:37:26,322 --> 00:37:28,401
You're like my parents.

647
00:37:29,601 --> 00:37:31,562
You gave me a good life,

648
00:37:32,161 --> 00:37:33,282
taught me skills,

649
00:37:33,641 --> 00:37:34,601
taught me how to be a man,

650
00:37:35,601 --> 00:37:36,881
gave me this

651
00:37:36,881 --> 00:37:38,601
disobedient wife,

652
00:37:39,322 --> 00:37:40,881
and an unfilial son.

653
00:37:42,681 --> 00:37:43,841
You've got to be kidding me.

654
00:37:45,121 --> 00:37:47,121
Didn't I give you a happy life?

655
00:37:47,121 --> 00:37:48,322
Yes, yes.

656
00:37:48,322 --> 00:37:49,802
Didn't I give you such an excellent son?

657
00:37:49,802 --> 00:37:50,841
-Yes, yes.
-That's right.

658
00:37:50,841 --> 00:37:52,401
The second toast is for you.

659
00:37:53,082 --> 00:37:54,361
I can't mess up the order.

660
00:37:54,361 --> 00:37:55,361
Come, Master.

661
00:37:56,201 --> 00:37:58,681
I have lived up to your expectations.

662
00:37:59,201 --> 00:38:00,802
I'm not doing very well,

663
00:38:01,641 --> 00:38:03,401
but to this family,

664
00:38:03,401 --> 00:38:05,282
to my wife,

665
00:38:05,722 --> 00:38:06,762
your daughter,

666
00:38:07,482 --> 00:38:08,921
I put my heart and soul into it.

667
00:38:09,802 --> 00:38:11,441
Whereas in teaching
and educating people,

668
00:38:11,601 --> 00:38:14,161
I have also followed your ways.

669
00:38:16,082 --> 00:38:16,921
Thank you.

670
00:38:17,441 --> 00:38:18,322
Thank you, Mrs. Song.

671
00:38:20,121 --> 00:38:21,082
Thank you, Dad, Mom.

672
00:38:29,881 --> 00:38:30,401
Tian Zhen.

673
00:38:31,441 --> 00:38:33,562
Don't you just have fun.

674
00:38:33,601 --> 00:38:34,282
I...

675
00:38:34,282 --> 00:38:35,881
You have to watch this carefully.

676
00:38:36,802 --> 00:38:39,802
We do this solemnly just to show you.

677
00:38:40,681 --> 00:38:41,722
I'm afraid

678
00:38:42,401 --> 00:38:43,802
I can't celebrate

679
00:38:43,841 --> 00:38:46,641
your 30th wedding anniversary.

680
00:38:48,601 --> 00:38:51,042
But your parents will remember

681
00:38:51,361 --> 00:38:55,201
this celebration and rules of theirs.

682
00:38:55,921 --> 00:38:56,802
We'll just do this.

683
00:38:57,601 --> 00:38:58,881
We'll do this from now on.

684
00:39:00,802 --> 00:39:01,322
By the way,

685
00:39:01,841 --> 00:39:05,201
you're missing a wife now.

686
00:39:07,401 --> 00:39:08,002
Grandpa.

687
00:39:08,562 --> 00:39:09,441
I got it!

688
00:39:09,962 --> 00:39:10,522
Rest assured.

689
00:39:12,562 --> 00:39:14,201
Remember all these things.

690
00:39:14,921 --> 00:39:16,121
This is your homework.

691
00:39:16,282 --> 00:39:19,681
Write an observation essay later.

692
00:39:20,641 --> 00:39:21,401
Yes, sir.

693
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:22,441
Gosh, you talk so much.

694
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,082
Come, Master. A toast to you.

695
00:39:50,161 --> 00:39:51,562
Hello, are you Mr. Ren Tian Zhen?

696
00:39:51,881 --> 00:39:52,962
Keep your voice down. Thank you.

697
00:39:52,962 --> 00:39:54,282
This is a gift you ordered.

698
00:39:54,681 --> 00:39:55,681
Please give me the verification code.

699
00:39:55,681 --> 00:39:56,201
Thanks.

700
00:39:56,802 --> 00:39:57,802
Verification code...

701
00:40:01,082 --> 00:40:02,401
Zero, three, one, six.

702
00:40:03,641 --> 00:40:05,121
Okay. This service is completed.

703
00:40:05,282 --> 00:40:05,722
Goodbye.

704
00:40:05,841 --> 00:40:07,082
Thank you for your hard work.

705
00:40:13,401 --> 00:40:14,522
He can't drink as much as me.

706
00:40:15,881 --> 00:40:18,121
It's true. He's not as good as me.

707
00:40:18,121 --> 00:40:20,282
It turns out my dad
not only knows how to say good things.

708
00:40:20,322 --> 00:40:21,562
Mom, look.

709
00:40:21,562 --> 00:40:23,201
He secretly ordered a gift for you.

710
00:40:23,841 --> 00:40:26,401
He just wanted to surprise you.

711
00:40:32,361 --> 00:40:32,881
Well...

712
00:40:33,881 --> 00:40:35,401
Why are you looking at me?

713
00:40:45,881 --> 00:40:47,082
I've been busted?

714
00:40:47,322 --> 00:40:48,962
Our son has grown up.

715
00:40:49,841 --> 00:40:50,921
He's sensible now.

716
00:40:51,562 --> 00:40:52,401
Come, come.

717
00:40:52,401 --> 00:40:54,242
Come, thank you, son. Thank you.

718
00:40:54,282 --> 00:40:54,802
Good.

719
00:40:54,802 --> 00:40:57,161
Master, Mrs. Song, cheers.

720
00:40:57,161 --> 00:40:58,641
Come, come.

721
00:40:58,641 --> 00:41:00,282
Happy anniversary.

722
00:41:00,322 --> 00:41:02,042
Thanks.

723
00:41:24,121 --> 00:41:26,121
In the blink of an eye,
30 years have passed.

724
00:41:28,322 --> 00:41:30,962
At first, I thought

725
00:41:31,361 --> 00:41:33,562
I would get
an outstanding person like a dragon.

726
00:41:34,401 --> 00:41:35,161
But I didn't expect

727
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:38,361
to marry a snake like you.

728
00:41:40,121 --> 00:41:42,601
Do you know what is
the common name for "snake"?

729
00:41:43,361 --> 00:41:44,121
Dragon on the earth.

730
00:41:45,121 --> 00:41:46,361
A dragon on the earth is also a dragon.

731
00:42:00,161 --> 00:42:01,322
Do you still remember this place?

732
00:42:04,322 --> 00:42:06,121
Back then,

733
00:42:08,121 --> 00:42:09,201
