00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:07,320
(30 Years Ago)

2
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,440
Wait a moment.

3
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,080
Will you marry me?

4
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,400
Back then,

5
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,640
this place wasn't this beautiful.

6
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,120
You guys only planted

7
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,280
herbs and grasses.

8
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,280
Do you remember I brought you
a bouquet of flowers?

9
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,560
(You stared at it like a fool.)

10
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,960
(I told you to take a sniff.)

11
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,760
(And you despised it.)

12
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,280
I did it on purpose.

13
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,640
(The arrival of Minor Snow)

14
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,560
(means that the weather
will turn colder and colder.)

15
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,520
(As the weather turns cold,
the amount of rain will increase.)

16
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,680
(Minor Snow is just a metaphor.)

17
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,360
(It means that there will only
be a minor amount of snow.)

18
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,360
(Minor Snow)

19
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,880
(Jiangzhou People's Hospital)

20
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,640
What are you doing? It's late now.

21
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,517
-Come here.
-Why did you come here suddenly?

22
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,560
Sit down.

23
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,520
Look.

24
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,760
It's something warm.

25
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,520
What do you mean by this?

26
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,517
You see, as a girl,

27
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,480
you must maintain your cleanliness.

28
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,800
No matter how busy you are,
you need to wash your feet.

29
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,440
Are you complaining that my feet stink?

30
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,880
I dare not do so.

31
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,880
I love them to death.

32
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,360
Since you're not coming to me,

33
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,760
I'll go to you then.

34
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,480
How's the temperature?

35
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,200
Why are you still carrying your shoes?

36
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,341
You're a neat lady, huh?

37
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,880
Will you be this long-winded
in the future?

38
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,680
Tou Tou,

39
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,520
when I celebrated your birthday for you,

40
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,520
I still had something I didn't tell you.

41
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,240
You're not alone.

42
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,960
Your family, your loved ones,

43
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,680
I'll make it up to you eventually.

44
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,960
I brought you some fresh clothes.

45
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,157
Remember to get changed

46
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,320
in Xing Xing's room later.

47
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,240
I'll collect the dirty laundry tomorrow.

48
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,200
You just want to complain about me.

49
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,080
Tou Tou,

50
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,400
as a girl,

51
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,280
you should be more meticulous

52
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,680
and particular.

53
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,960
What if our daughter takes after you

54
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,437
in the future?

55
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,800
You can raise her yourself then.

56
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:27,960
Okay.

57
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,280
But are you sure you don't want
to head home?

58
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,680
There are nurses on duty here.

59
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,080
You can sleep better at home.

60
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,600
This way, you'll have more energy
on the next day.

61
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,200
I have to stand guard over here.

62
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,320
I won't go back unless
Master tells me to.

63
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,877
Your master can't just let you

64
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,680
stand guard over here all day long.

65
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,920
You need to eat and sleep somehow.

66
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,080
Will you obey your master
or your husband?

67
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,440
Why are you saying that again?

68
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,557
What if the students of the apprentice
class take turns to stay here?

69
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,520
No. I don't trust other people.

70
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,797
Do you trust me then?
I'll take your shift.

71
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,120
I don't.

72
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,877
You're close to Zhao Li Quan.

73
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,520
You'll go easy on him
if he says he wants to go inside.

74
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,837
In the end,

75
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,680
you still don't trust Li Quan.

76
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,080
I won't trust him

77
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,760
until the truth is out.

78
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,520
But don't worry.

79
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,440
I've already told Roubecca.

80
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,080
She'll take my shift every three days.

81
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,400
You would rather trust Roubecca than me?

82
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,037
It's because Roubecca
is a trustworthy person.

83
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,357
It's either she doesn't agree to it,

84
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,200
or she does a good job
after agreeing to it.

85
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,560
If she stands guard over here,

86
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,360
not even a fly can get inside.

87
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:45,960
Fine.

88
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,880
First, you were jealous of your father.

89
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,280
Now, you're jealous of Roubecca.

90
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,397
Were you born

91
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,640
out of jealousy?

92
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,920
You're ignoring me now?

93
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,080
Take this!

94
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,277
You want to play, huh?

95
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,240
Take this!

96
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,960
(Jiangzhou People's Hospital)

97
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,677
Listen.

98
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,640
I could tell that you didn't focus
during the technique class.

99
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,197
You couldn't find my acupressure point.

100
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,080
Higher.

101
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,360
-Here?
-Higher.

102
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,320
That's the spot.

103
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,996
That's the spot.

104
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,559
Tou Tou, I have something
important to ask you.

105
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,480
What is it?

106
00:07:23,095 --> 00:07:24,800
What's with you and Liu Zi Hong?

107
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,120
So, you found out about us?

108
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,880
I...

109
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,120
(15 Days Ago)

110
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,840
Tou Tou.

111
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,360
I like you.

112
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,600
I don't.

113
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,837
Hey, I'm serious. I like you.

114
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,680
I'm serious too. I don't.

115
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,760
Liu Zi Hong, listen.

116
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,317
Your public persona will crumble

117
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,560
before you get famous.

118
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,717
Wait.

119
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,840
It's not like I'm everyone's
dream boyfriend.

120
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,800
Give me the cloth.

121
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,320
Wait.

122
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,120
It's not like I'm going to be
everyone's dream boyfriend.

123
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,837
If I do get into a relationship,

124
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,117
I won't hide it from them.

125
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,077
My fans

126
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,557
are just audience.

127
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,520
It's not like they're God.

128
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,797
I'm making the decision myself.

129
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,960
I'll bear the consequences.

130
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,640
Seems like you've grown up.

131
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,560
So,

132
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,320
-is that a yes?
-What are you saying?

133
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,640
Listen.

134
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,440
I just see you as my little brother.

135
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,520
Actually, I don't see you as my brother.

136
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,960
We aren't even close.

137
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,557
Stop saying nonsense like that.

138
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,240
I don't care. I like you.

139
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,680
I like you. I...

140
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,117
Liu Zi Hong, have you lost your mind?

141
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,600
I'll go out and tell everyone

142
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,560
that you're my girlfriend.

143
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,957
How could you be so shameless?

144
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,200
-I'm shameless.
-Give it to me.

145
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,240
Nope.

146
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,757
Are you a fool?

147
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,237
What's inside your brain?

148
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,557
Is it made of wood?

149
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,000
If there was nothing between you two,

150
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,517
why did he keep looking for you?

151
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,917
And, you even wanted everyone
to vote for him.

152
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,880
Hey.

153
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,437
I can't just tie him up

154
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,720
and tell him to stop looking for me.

155
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,960
But I already told him.

156
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,320
I clarified everything.

157
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,797
He won't look for me again.

158
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,840
What did you tell him?

159
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,677
I said you're the only one
in my heart.

160
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,000
I have no space for anyone else.

161
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,400
But you're a rough lady.

162
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,077
Did he know that you didn't
wash your feet for three days?

163
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:41,960
Does he still like you
after hearing that?

164
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,840
I...

165
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,640
What have my stinky feet got to do

166
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,160
with him liking me or not?

167
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,480
He didn't wash his feet for a week.

168
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,280
How did you know?

169
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,080
I took a sniff.

170
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,160
That's my fetish.

171
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,757
Sun Tou Tou, you're done for.

172
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,200
No, wait!

173
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,357
Take a sniff. Here.

174
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,557
Feel it.

175
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,520
What are you doing?

176
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,317
Come on, here you go.

177
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,557
Smell your stinky sock.

178
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,360
It doesn't stink!

179
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,840
How is it, Tou Tou?
Is Professor Wu doing well?

180
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,917
Everything's normal. All signs

181
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,637
indicate that it's developing
in the right direction.

182
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,960
So you guys don't need to
worry too much.

183
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,437
-Madam Wu.
-Hello, Madam Wu.

184
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,317
Madam, Senior Madam.

185
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,240
Hi.

186
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,480
Tou Tou.

187
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,040
Is Shan Dao awake?

188
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,360
How is it?

189
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:34,960
He's not awake yet.

190
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,560
Did Mr Wu even wake up today?

191
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,640
He's still very weak.

192
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,400
He needs a lot of sleep.

193
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,520
Don't worry.

194
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,880
Tou Tou, according to you,

195
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,917
are you saying that you're the only one
who saw Mr Wu

196
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,880
waking up?

197
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,400
Are you lying to us?

198
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,557
That's not it.

199
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,240
Tou Tou has been
standing guard over here.

200
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,000
There's no reason for her to lie to us.

201
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,080
Maybe she's just trying
to talk herself up.

202
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,317
That's not true.

203
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,797
Yesterday, Xin Zheng said

204
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,877
Shan Dao was fine.

205
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,317
He'll recover very soon.

206
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,757
Yeah. It's like this for
patients who just recovered.

207
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,877
-I met patients like him before.
-Yeah.

208
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,437
Mr Wu has been seriously injured.

209
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,960
He needs to rest and recuperate.

210
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,640
I checked his eyelid's muscle response.

211
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,917
However, there are no other instances
of him regaining consciousness.

212
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,877
Tou Tou said

213
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,437
Professor Wu could talk.

214
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,677
Enough.

215
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,080
Let's stop arguing.

216
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,637
What about this? Let's adopt
a shift system starting tonight.

217
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,637
It's too tiring for Tou Tou
to take care of him alone.

218
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,720
She'll develop hallucinations easily.

219
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,437
I'll take care of him tonight.

220
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,400
I don't agree with that.

221
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,960
Tou Tou, your senior uncle is awake.

222
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,560
He's awake?

223
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,880
He's awake?

224
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,920
-Let's hurry!
-Don't come inside!

225
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,360
This is the ICU!

226
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,680
Let us take a look!

227
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,797
-We're his students.
-I understand your feelings.

228
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,720
I understand your feelings.

229
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,000
Only his family members can come inside.

230
00:11:45,081 --> 00:11:46,200
The rest of you, stay outside.

231
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,840
We're his family members.

232
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,680
Shan Dao?

233
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,600
Wu Shan Dao?

234
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,000
Look.

235
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,040
He has already regained consciousness.

236
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,197
Wu Shan Dao,

237
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,520
do you know who am I?

238
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,000
You...

239
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:21,640
You are my friend.

240
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,320
Yes. Not only am I your friend,

241
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,880
but I'm also your attending physician.

242
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,557
How do you feel?

243
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,520
Are you okay?

244
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,320
Yeah.

245
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,240
Come, shake my hand.

246
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,000
Seems like there's a long way to go
before he fully recovers.

247
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,960
I think we can transfer him
to a normal ward now.

248
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,117
The physiotherapists can help him out
after some time.

249
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,160
Thank you.

250
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,117
-This is great.
-Thank you.

251
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:50,997
Thank you, Mr Li.

252
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,120
Don't be too excited.

253
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,920
Let him rest well.

254
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,040
Tou Tou?

255
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,560
He's awake.

256
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,720
He's awake, huh?

257
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,760
It must've been tough on you.

258
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,800
Okay now.

259
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,640
Don't cry. He's awake.

260
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,680
Everything's fine now.

261
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,757
It must've been tough on you.

262
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,200
Alright now.

263
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,160
Poor little girl.

264
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,280
It's Mr Li.

265
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,280
Hurry.

266
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,840
-You're here too?
-Mr Li.

267
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,600
Your name is Tou Tou, right?

268
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,000
-Yes.
-She's a filial girl.

269
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,360
Your senior uncle

270
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,240
is awake.
Your effort wasn't in vain.

271
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,760
He hasn't regained
his consciousness completely.

272
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:06,690
He can't recognise everyone.

273
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,080
However, this is already a great start.

274
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,320
Don't cry.

275
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,880
Congratulations.

276
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,640
-Thank you.
-Ren.

277
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,240
It's no wonder people say
that you're a demigod.

278
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,680
If I must say, you're a god.

279
00:14:19,656 --> 00:14:21,333
You can always

280
00:14:21,417 --> 00:14:22,942
save a person's life
no matter how dire the situation is

281
00:14:23,026 --> 00:14:24,466
as long as you will it, huh?

282
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,080
Tou Tou, did you get that?

283
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,860
Mr Li is teasing me.

284
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,200
Mr Li,

285
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,200
he has been in that state
for a long time.

286
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,637
It's all thanks to the care
of the Western doctors.

287
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,280
We dare not claim credit for it.

288
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,080
I'm just stating facts.

289
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,520
Both Western and Chinese medicine
are working in tandem here.

290
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,117
We Western doctors
can't really do anything

291
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,960
after performing surgeries.

292
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,560
It's all thanks to your great student.

293
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,520
Faith will move mountains indeed.

294
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,400
It's no wonder you think
so highly of her.

295
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,637
Thank you, Dr Li.

296
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,197
May I bring Master inside now?

297
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,317
-Sure.
-Let's go.

298
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,477
But wait a moment.

299
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,397
I already instructed the nurse

300
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,877
to transfer Mr Wu
to the special care unit.

301
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,797
The conditions over there

302
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,320
are better than the ICU.

303
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,680
You guys can visit him there.

304
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,840
Okay.

305
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,120
Thank you.

Wu.

Shan Dao.

309
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,880
Wu!

310
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,197
Shan Dao!

311
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,037
Wake up.

312
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,037
Open your eyes and take a look!

313
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,640
Look at all the people
who are here to visit you.

314
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,120
Over here.

315
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,437
This is Mum.

316
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,520
Shan Dao.

317
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,600
Ren.

318
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,197
Xin Zheng is here to see you too.

319
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,160
Look.

320
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,280
And this girl.

321
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,197
This is Sun Tou Tou.

322
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,400
She's been taking care of you
all the time.

323
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,360
She's a great girl.

324
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,677
Li Quan, come here.

325
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,880
Shan Dao, this is your student, Li Quan.

326
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,760
Look at him.

327
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,000
Mr Wu.

328
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,200
You recognised him, right?

329
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,960
Calm down.

330
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,760
Li Quan is a good boy too.

331
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,160
He visited you every day.

332
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,200
Alright.

333
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,640
Calm down.

334
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,320
(Jiangzhou People's Hospital)

335
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,000
Hello?

336
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:29,997
(Hello.)

337
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,357
I'm Tou Tou's boyfriend.

338
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,400
I'm looking for Tou Tou.

339
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,520
Tou Tou's boyfriend?

340
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,477
Yes. It's like this.

341
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,877
I brought her some things.

342
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,520
And, I'm not allowed to
deliver them upstairs.

343
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,240
Tell her to come down and take them.

344
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,840
(Okay.)

345
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,640
-Thank you.
-(You're welcome.)

346
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,237
Tou Tou's boyfriend
is truly nice to her.

347
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,197
Yeah.

348
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,117
I said she must've saved the world

349
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,440
in her past life.

350
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,797
She said her boyfriend was plain

351
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,797
and ordinary.

352
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,877
Tell her then.

353
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,877
I'll heat our food.

354
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,800
Okay.

355
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,680
Tou Tou,

356
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,920
your "ordinary" boyfriend
is waiting for you downstairs.

357
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,360
Wait.

358
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,800
I thought he just left?
Why has he returned?

359
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,957
Go now. He must've brought

360
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,160
something good for you.

361
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,197
Alright, I got it.

362
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,440
-Thank you.
-Don't mention it.

363
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,640
"Ordinary", huh?

364
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,440
-Nurse.
-Coming.

365
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,960
That Mr Wang.

366
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:42,877
What's the matter?

367
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,400
He wants to come back here.

368
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,440
He had been hospitalised for some time.

369
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:47,837
Goodness.

370
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,037
I guess he's already used to it.

371
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,520
Alright, you may go inside.

372
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,920
Wait. Please make way.

373
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,000
Tou Tou.

374
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,400
Hello, Tian Zhen.
Did you come to the hospital?

375
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:50,840
You didn't?

376
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,800
Alright, I got it.

377
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,120
Get up!

378
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,520
What are you doing?

379
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,280
I did nothing.

380
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,680
Go away.

381
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,880
I'm wiping the sweat off
my teacher's face.

382
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,880
Stop lying!

383
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,320
Zhao Li Quan,

384
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,557
I can do all of these myself.
Stay out of this.

385
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,560
Leave immediately.

386
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,760
Can you even do it?

387
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,600
Where were you just now?

388
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,720
Didn't you see that my teacher
was sweating profusely?

389
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,440
You can do all of these?

390
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,280
I thought you were supposed
to stand guard over him?

391
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,400
So, it was you, huh?

392
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,240
What are you saying?

393
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,837
Tou Tou, what are you saying? I have
no idea what you're talking about.

394
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,960
As for what you were up to,

395
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,877
the truth will be revealed

396
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,320
when I retrieve
the surveillance footage.

397
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,280
Now,

398
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,360
leave the room immediately.

399
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,280
You can go ahead.

400
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,717
Even so, you can only find footage
of you fooling around

401
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,160
with those nurses out there.

402
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,720
Go ahead.

403
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,760
Tou Tou, what's the matter?

404
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,957
The alarm by the nurse's station
was rung just now.

405
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,080
Did something happen?

406
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,520
Everything's normal.

407
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,557
I heard from Li Quan

408
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,357
that Professor Wu's condition
should be taking a turn for the better.

409
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,440
This is great.

410
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,717
-Wait.
-Tou Tou.

411
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,640
Tou Tou.

412
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,597
How's Mr Wu doing today?
Can he recognise people now?

413
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,117
He can speak now, right?

414
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,357
I heard that they were injecting

415
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,557
the medicine into his stomach.

416
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,280
What prescription did Mr Ren give him?

417
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,077
Cerebral haemorrhage
is just like a flood.

418
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,720
It'll flood and blur the boundaries
between the human brain.

419
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,997
Many people will either
experience amnesia

420
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,200
or be incoherent after they wake up.

421
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,197
So, how exactly is
Mr Wu doing right now?

422
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,117
Wait, did you guys
agree to come together?

423
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,677
What's with all the people here?

424
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,920
And, it's not like you guys
don't know this.

425
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,957
The special care unit can only
accommodate a few visitors at a time.

426
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,480
Li Quan told us to come here.

427
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,717
He said he visited him yesterday

428
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,960
and that Professor Wu
was doing much better.

429
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,680
That's why we came here to visit him.

430
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,920
-Yeah.
-Li Quan told us to come.

431
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,677
It's like this. It's too crowded here.

432
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,957
I suggest you guys head back first.

433
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,800
We can arrange for visits by day.

434
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,640
You guys can come by then.

435
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,957
Go now. Stop messing around.

436
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:06,840
Tou Tou.

437
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,520
Tou Tou, how is it?

438
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,160
What's going on?

439
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,197
What's with all these people here?

440
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,920
We're here to visit Professor Wu.

441
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,280
Thank you.

442
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,960
I'll thank you guys
on Professor Wu's behalf.

443
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,400
Tou Tou,

444
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,357
they'll just visit him for a minute.

445
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,357
It should be fine, right?

446
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,160
Why did you call everyone here?

447
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,717
Why did I call them here?

448
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,960
Mr Wu is awake.

449
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,437
As his students,

450
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,880
shouldn't we visit him?

451
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:37,880
You guys should.

452
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,360
Everyone can visit him

453
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:41,880
except for you.

454
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,720
Mind your manners.

455
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,880
Your senior aunt is still here.

456
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,160
You don't get to make the call here.

457
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,360
What's the matter?

458
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,480
Is there a misunderstanding
between you two?

459
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,800
Ms Shen,

460
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,037
I'm not allowing him to enter

461
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,440
for Senior Uncle's sake.

462
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,000
You trust me, right?

463
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,160
What do you mean?

464
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,680
Senior Aunt,

465
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,440
you had no idea.

466
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,880
Tou Tou couldn't bear the sight of me.

467
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,680
This...

468
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,480
Everyone knows this.

469
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,200
Tou Tou is the leader of the pack.

470
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,077
I've pleaded with her several times

471
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,800
so that I could take her shift
and take care of Mr Wu.

472
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,077
She didn't agree to it. It was as if
I was out to steal her credit.

473
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,437
-How could that be?
-But you should know

474
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,960
that I'm not that kind of person.

475
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,957
Tou Tou can claim
all the credit she wants.

476
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:24,920
Zhao Li Quan.

477
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,920
Master told me to stand guard
over the door.

478
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,160
That means I have to do it.

479
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,120
I don't care what you say.

480
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,560
I won't allow you to enter.

481
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,877
Tou Tou, everyone wants to visit Mr Wu.

482
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,517
What about this? We can line up
and enter the room one by one,

483
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,400
okay?

484
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,357
-Yeah.
-We can line up.

485
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,360
Sure.

486
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,717
You guys can enter the room one by one.

487
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,117
But please be silent.

488
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,517
And, Ms Shen

489
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,757
and Peng Shi Yan will
enter the room first.

490
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,360
Once Ms Shen and Peng Shi Yan are out,

491
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,597
the others can take turns
to go inside, okay?

492
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,680
Okay.

493
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,400
-Let's go.
-Senior Aunt.

494
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,520
You should let Li Quan visit him too.

495
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,560
You see...

496
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,757
He's anxious.

497
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,077
He picked me up early in the morning.

498
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,237
-Senior Aunt, that's enough.
-He told me a lot.

499
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,597
Li Quan is in no hurry.

500
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,397
He already came here last night.

501
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,080
We were lucky that Senior Uncle
was still alive.

502
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,117
What do you mean by that?

503
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,080
I'm sure you know that the best.

504
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,640
Tou Tou, you're being offensive here.

505
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,557
What do you mean by
we're lucky that he's still alive?

506
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,957
What exactly is going on?

507
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,720
Tou Tou, didn't I say already?

508
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,880
You can claim all the credit you want.

509
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,760
I won't steal them from you.

510
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,520
Just let me visit him, okay?

511
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,000
I'll bear the consequences
if anything happens.

512
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,360
Does this count as surrendering to you?

513
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,880
Can I enter the ward now?

514
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:44,920
Zhao Li Quan,

515
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,757
can you stop pretending to be pitiful

516
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,760
and make it as if I'm bullying you?

517
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,800
Fine.

518
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,320
You want to go inside?

519
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,557
Before that, explain yourself

520
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,397
to Ms Shen

521
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,360
and the others.

522
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,317
Why did you sneak into

523
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,960
his ward last night?

524
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,677
Why did the alarm ring

525
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,960
when you approached Senior Uncle?

526
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,200
Fine. I'll explain myself.

527
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,520
Everyone, listen.

528
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,880
I came here last night

529
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,640
just to take a look at Mr Wu.

530
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,080
Just one look.

531
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,240
But Tou Tou didn't allow me to.

532
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,157
Tou Tou, you keep going against me.

533
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,880
You think I have no idea
what you're up to?

534
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,520
You're just afraid that
I'll expose you, right?

535
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,840
But Sun Tou Tou, listen up.

536
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,280
I'm not a scum like that.

537
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,280
Even if I do know your secret,

538
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,000
I won't expose you.

539
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,400
What secret do I have?

540
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,240
What secret is there for you to expose?

541
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,640
Zhao Li Quan,

542
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,960
I'm an honest and upright person.

543
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,957
There's nothing for me to be afraid of.

544
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,437
Today, I represent Master
and the acupuncture sect.

545
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,280
I have to defend this door at all costs.

546
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,080
But you?

547
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,040
Although I don't know what you're up to,

548
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,240
I know Senior Uncle's accident
is related to you somehow.

549
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,280
But I'm in no hurry.

550
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,200
You shouldn't be impatient too.

551
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,680
Once Senior Uncle wakes up,

552
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,000
everything

553
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,160
will come to light.

554
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,800
Let's go.

555
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,920
Who do you think you are?

556
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,720
You represent Mr Ren
and the acupuncture sect?

557
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,680
Stop pretending to be the successor.

558
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,517
I didn't expose you
on account of Mr Ren.

559
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,080
I want to retain my mentor's dignity.

560
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,840
You don't understand?

561
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,760
You're a fake.

562
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,560
You're an impostor.

563
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,280
Where are your parents?

564
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,520
You have no idea.

565
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,277
You're not the true successor

566
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,240
of the Jiang family's acupuncture sect.

567
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,840
You're just a wild girl.

568
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,917
You're a wild child!

569
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,880
Zhao Li Quan!

570
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,760
What did you say just now?

571
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,360
What did I say?

572
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,160
You're unfit to stay here.

573
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,760
You're a crook.

574
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,480
You forged all of these.

575
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,600
My grandmother, Granny Zeng,

576
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,677
is the founder of the Jiang family's
acupuncture sect.

577
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,157
My mother died in an effort
to support the flood relief movement.

578
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,557
I'm the successor of the sect.

579
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,280
That's what Master told me.

580
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,840
Zhao Li Quan, where did you get
all of these documents?

581
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,160
Successor of the sect?

582
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,560
Listen.

583
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,720
Mr Wu gave them to me personally.

584
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,360
Mr Wu even told me

585
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,760
about your true identity as an impostor.

586
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,080
Tian Zhen.

587
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,080
Maybe your father was an accomplice too.

588
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,240
Now, you guys know
why Tou Tou doesn't want

589
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,960
to let me visit Mr Wu.

590
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,440
She's afraid that Mr Wu

591
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,157
might expose her

592
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,720
once he recovers.

593
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,760
I'll kill you!

594
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,800
Tou Tou!

595
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,000
I'll kill you!

596
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,037
Listen!

597
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,277
I saw you when you snuck into

598
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,480
the ward last night!

599
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,397
He made all of these false documents

600
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,880
because I caught him red-handed!

601
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,600
All of these are false!
None of them is true!

602
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,040
If any of my words are false,

603
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,400
may thunder strike me!

604
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,957
I'm not lying!

605
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:48,920
Tou Tou.

606
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,040
You're an impostor.

607
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,197
You're a wild child.

608
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,557
You're unfit to stand here.

609
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,600
She's fit!

610
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,800
Enough.

611
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,400
Stop crying.

612
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,516
Sun Tou Tou isn't

613
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,080
the successor of the Jiang family's
acupuncture sect.

614
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,637
However, no one here

615
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,760
is worthy enough to stand here
except for her.

616
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,720
It's because she's my daughter.

617
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,120
Say that again?

618
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,720
She's my daughter.

619
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,040
Mr Ren,

620
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,760
I suggest you think twice

621
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,360
before saying anything!

622
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,880
Say, do you think

623
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,560
something will happen to Lan?

624
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,960
No one expected this to happen.

625
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,800
How could that be true?

626
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,037
How could Tou Tou be

627
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,277
Ren's illegitimate daughter?

628
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,240
Ren isn't that kind of person.

629
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:23,280
However, if it's true,

630
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:26,317
since she's younger than Tian Zhen,

631
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,640
that means he had her
after marrying Lan.

632
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,280
That's impossible.

633
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,720
What should we do now?

634
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,757
If Shan Dao wasn't unconscious,

635
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,960
he could've explained the situation
and resolved any tension.

636
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,880
But look at him now.

637
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,480
Should I tell Master and Madam about it?

638
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,160
You mustn't be a busybody.

639
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,157
That's not it.

640
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,157
This is a huge deal.

641
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,197
If it's true,

642
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,117
there's no way to hide it.

643
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,157
It'll be revealed eventually.

644
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,080
The person telling them
is important too.

645
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,797
I've been friends with Lan
for many years.

646
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,957
I know her well.

647
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,800
She'll never tell her parents
about this.

648
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,360
However, if this is true,

649
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,680
their family might be affected.

650
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:15,960
Judging from Lan's personality,

651
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,717
she'll only tell her parents

652
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,877
after everything is done.

653
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,077
If that's the case,

654
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:20,997
everything will be too late.

655
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,200
It'll be a foregone conclusion by then.

656
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,477
Shen Xin,

657
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,800
we haven't settled
our family affair yet.

658
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,200
Now, you want to poke into
other people's business?

659
00:34:35,473 --> 00:34:37,393
Shan Dao is lying unconscious.

660
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,320
I feel terrible.

661
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:44,560
However, there's still hope
for his recovery.

662
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,800
I'm just thinking

663
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,560
about what I would do

664
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,280
if I encountered the same thing as Lan.

665
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,238
It's heartbreaking.

666
00:34:56,307 --> 00:34:57,706
I don't know what I'll do.

667
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,240
There are always ordeals to overcome.

668
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,960
We have to overcome them one by one.

669
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,280
Mum,

670
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,717
I think we should help them

671
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,840
when we can.

672
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,997
Mr Song is a wise man.

673
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,717
This is a crucial moment.

674
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,880
We need him to take a hold
of the situation.

675
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,240
I think I should tell him about it.

676
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,997
If so, please look after him.

677
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,000
Alright. Go now.

678
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,440
Call me if anything happens.

679
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,840
Shan Dao, if only you were awake.

680
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,080
You could've resolved everything.

681
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,360
A good lady must obey.

682
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,077
Do you know how old we are?

683
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,477
How could you bear to
leave us standing here

684
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,760
when the breeze is chilling?

685
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,160
Follow us home.

686
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,520
Come.

687
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,120
Look.

688
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,760
She doesn't listen to me.

689
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,880
Persuade her.

690
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,997
I won't. I'm a woman too.

691
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,600
I understand a woman's heart.

692
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,877
Once it's broken,
it can never be repaired.

693
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,960
Stop causing trouble.

694
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,240
Don't you think
it's troublesome enough already?

695
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,800
Say something nice.
Don't say something disheartening.

696
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,157
By the way,

697
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:46,757
Winter Solstice is nearing.

698
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,880
We haven't brewed

699
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,320
the Winter Solstice health soup yet.

700
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,840
Look at the situation we're in.

701
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,000
You're still talking about soup?

702
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,480
In life,

703
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,600
there are many ordeals
we have to overcome,

704
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:03,600
and we have to overcome them one by one.

705
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,040
This has nothing to do with one's mood.

706
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,160
Let's take Sima Qian as an example.

707
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,877
Even if he was tortured,

708
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,717
he still had to celebrate
the Qingming Festival,

709
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,960
the Chongyang Festival,
and Winter Solstice too.

710
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,000
If not, there would be no Shi Ji.

711
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:24,160
It doesn't matter
if we skip a bowl of soup.

712
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,280
If so, it doesn't matter
if we have an extra child.

713
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,600
I just want to lighten up the mood.

714
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,520
Go back.

715
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,000
Go and prepare the prescriptions
with Xin Zheng.

716
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,600
I'll keep our daughter company.

717
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,040
A good lady must obey, okay?

718
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,800
Master.

719
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,437
You still need to do the things
you're supposed to.

720
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,760
Do you know what day it is?

721
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,040
Have you started brewing
the Winter Solstice Soup?

722
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,880
I'll brew it right now.

723
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,080
Master, I...

724
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,520
I trust you.

725
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,440
I never doubted you

726
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,880
when I handed over my position

727
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,280
and my daughter to you.

728
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,240
It'll be the same in the future.

729
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,360
That is all.

730
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,680
Thank you, Master.

731
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,720
Mum, you should head back too.

732
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,280
No, I won't.

733
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,000
Look at the state you're in.

734
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,320
How could I go back?

735
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,680
Mum.

736
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,200
I...

737
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:18,280
I just don't understand him.

738
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,520
Why is he doing this to me?

739
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,920
Actually,

740
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,800
I'm not angry at all.

741
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,560
I just feel

742
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,080
disappointed.

743
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,520
Do you know this? When I...

744
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,957
When I looked at him,

745
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,397
(he avoided my eyes.)

746
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,640
(At that time, I felt...)

747
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,593
I suddenly felt like

748
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:56,040
we were strangers.

749
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,920
