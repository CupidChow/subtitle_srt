00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,920
(Gen Z)

2
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,880
(Episode 29)

3
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:43,441
Xin Zheng didn't even look at you.

4
00:01:43,691 --> 00:01:44,811
When he came to our house,

5
00:01:44,922 --> 00:01:47,161
he went straight to his master's study.

6
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:49,001
And someone here

7
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,361
kept bringing in apples

8
00:01:51,442 --> 00:01:53,602
and tea.

9
00:01:53,801 --> 00:01:55,002
That's not true.

10
00:01:55,122 --> 00:01:55,922
I...

11
00:01:56,362 --> 00:01:58,762
I was just showing filial piety
to my father.

12
00:01:58,961 --> 00:02:00,603
So now that he's our son-in-law,

13
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,833
you're no longer showing
filial piety to your father?

14
00:02:04,682 --> 00:02:06,641
Why are you so annoying?

15
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,960
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

16
00:02:09,042 --> 00:02:10,002
Okay, okay.

17
00:02:10,082 --> 00:02:12,322
I'll stop. You're not mad anymore.
I'm going inside.

18
00:02:12,921 --> 00:02:13,721
Don't go, don't go.

19
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:15,761
I'm still mad. I'm still mad.

20
00:02:19,402 --> 00:02:21,002
You said

21
00:02:21,882 --> 00:02:23,801
he was acting like a child.

22
00:02:24,641 --> 00:02:27,362
but you are the one
who is still acting like a child.

23
00:02:28,362 --> 00:02:30,082
I just don't want to grow up.

24
00:02:30,242 --> 00:02:32,601
I've been worrying about you
all my life.

25
00:02:36,362 --> 00:02:37,282
All right now.

26
00:02:37,362 --> 00:02:38,202
Okay.

27
00:02:43,281 --> 00:02:44,362
Cheers.

28
00:02:48,002 --> 00:02:48,802
I can see that

29
00:02:49,241 --> 00:02:50,774
you are in a really good mood today.

30
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,560
How can I not be in a good mood
when I got two good news today?

31
00:02:53,641 --> 00:02:54,720
You got your bonus today?

32
00:02:55,961 --> 00:02:56,761
Guess again.

33
00:02:58,362 --> 00:03:01,082
What's better than getting a bonus?

34
00:03:03,362 --> 00:03:04,961
Tou Tou called me.

35
00:03:05,641 --> 00:03:06,521
What did they say?

36
00:03:07,762 --> 00:03:09,561
I've been busy
dealing with that client.

37
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,160
I haven't had time to visit
the medical centre.

38
00:03:11,241 --> 00:03:12,722
I'm worried about Tian Zhen.

39
00:03:12,841 --> 00:03:15,082
Meng Meng's death hit him hard.

40
00:03:15,162 --> 00:03:16,441
He's having a hard time getting over it.

41
00:03:16,521 --> 00:03:17,561
Don't worry.

42
00:03:17,641 --> 00:03:19,161
Ren Tian Zhen and Sun Tou Tou

43
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:21,201
are doing well now, very well.

44
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:22,682
Especially him, he's busy.

45
00:03:22,961 --> 00:03:23,761
Busy with dating.

46
00:03:27,722 --> 00:03:29,281
Who... Who's dating?

47
00:03:29,641 --> 00:03:30,442
Tian Zhen.

48
00:03:31,802 --> 00:03:33,082
Tian Zhen is dating someone?

49
00:03:33,162 --> 00:03:35,575
It hasn't been that long since
Meng Meng passed away. Has he no heart?

50
00:03:35,881 --> 00:03:37,161
He doesn't like Meng Meng.

51
00:03:37,241 --> 00:03:38,281
He likes someone else.

52
00:03:38,442 --> 00:03:39,242
Who?

53
00:03:44,362 --> 00:03:45,561
I don't have kids.
I don't need a tutor.

54
00:03:45,641 --> 00:03:46,882
I don't want to invest in funds
or buy insurance.

55
00:03:46,962 --> 00:03:48,408
And I didn't order anything lately.

56
00:03:48,641 --> 00:03:49,802
It's me.

57
00:03:51,155 --> 00:03:53,781
I've only been gone for a few days.
Have you forgotten me already?

58
00:03:55,481 --> 00:03:56,481
Tou Tou?

59
00:03:56,921 --> 00:03:58,041
Did you just remember to call me?

60
00:03:58,082 --> 00:04:00,360
Where have you been? I couldn't
find you at the medical centre.

61
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,340
Why are you laughing?

62
00:04:06,561 --> 00:04:08,962
Want to hear
my Hollywood blockbuster story?

63
00:04:09,362 --> 00:04:11,602
Hollywood blockbuster story?

64
00:04:11,962 --> 00:04:12,762
Go on.

65
00:04:14,722 --> 00:04:15,522
It's okay.

66
00:04:15,641 --> 00:04:17,201
Come. Let me read your pulse.

67
00:04:17,281 --> 00:04:19,201
I found my original aspiration.

68
00:04:19,802 --> 00:04:20,954
What original aspiration?

69
00:04:21,362 --> 00:04:22,202
You don't remember?

70
00:04:22,281 --> 00:04:23,401
I've told you before.

71
00:04:23,561 --> 00:04:26,201
What was my original aspiration
when I decided to study TCM?

72
00:04:26,882 --> 00:04:28,561
Your original aspiration was...

73
00:04:30,082 --> 00:04:31,321
Do you know what matters?

74
00:04:31,401 --> 00:04:32,201
What?

75
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,080
There is a handsome guy there.

76
00:04:34,162 --> 00:04:36,041
He's tall, thin and fair-skinned.

77
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,134
And he's difficult.

78
00:04:40,121 --> 00:04:41,201
Tou Tou!

79
00:04:41,561 --> 00:04:42,602
Really?

80
00:04:44,082 --> 00:04:46,201
Really? Why would I lie to you?

81
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,800
Why would I lie about
something like this?

82
00:04:47,882 --> 00:04:49,641
How did you get him to date you?

83
00:04:51,281 --> 00:04:52,322
Tian Xing Xing,

84
00:04:52,802 --> 00:04:54,722
he could be the one
who asked me to date him.

85
00:04:55,002 --> 00:04:56,794
Why did you presume
that I asked him first?

86
00:04:58,641 --> 00:05:01,322
I've noticed that you possess
a magical power.

87
00:05:01,841 --> 00:05:02,641
A magical power?

88
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:03,841
What do you mean?

89
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,680
I could tell from the way
you win at claw machines.

90
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,720
Your wishes always come true.

91
00:05:12,281 --> 00:05:13,081
Could it...

92
00:05:13,281 --> 00:05:14,681
Could it be that

93
00:05:14,953 --> 00:05:16,481
I have inherited my master's skill?

94
00:05:17,082 --> 00:05:17,882
What skill?

95
00:05:20,121 --> 00:05:21,281
He mentioned before that

96
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:22,522
he has a special ability.

97
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,640
This is a line from Questions of
Organic and Fundamental Nature.

98
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,160
It means that as long as you cleanse

99
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:28,642
both internally and externally,

100
00:05:28,722 --> 00:05:32,242
you can achieve a state
of transcendence like me,

101
00:05:32,522 --> 00:05:33,601
capable of travelling

102
00:05:37,281 --> 00:05:38,121
anywhere you want.

103
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,360
And all my dreams will come true.

104
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,681
I really didn't see it coming
with those two.

105
00:05:57,882 --> 00:06:01,121
Tian Zhen, that brat,
didn't even mention it to me.

106
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,079
I must call him
and criticize him for this.

107
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:03,960
Don't.

108
00:06:04,521 --> 00:06:06,761
They are on their honeymoon
and spending alone time together.

109
00:06:06,841 --> 00:06:08,002
Don't disturb them.

110
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:08,880
By the way,

111
00:06:08,922 --> 00:06:11,121
you can't tell anyone
about their relationship.

112
00:06:12,159 --> 00:06:13,107
I won't tell anyone.

113
00:06:13,227 --> 00:06:14,333
I will keep it to myself.

114
00:06:14,722 --> 00:06:16,403
Especially your friend, Peng Yu Yan.

115
00:06:16,493 --> 00:06:17,614
What's his name again?

116
00:06:17,722 --> 00:06:18,642
Peng Shi Yan.

117
00:06:18,922 --> 00:06:19,908
You mustn't tell him.

118
00:06:21,121 --> 00:06:22,521
He's got loose lips.

119
00:06:23,401 --> 00:06:24,201
I won't tell him.

120
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,720
Okay.

121
00:06:26,162 --> 00:06:27,482
That's my good news.

122
00:06:27,801 --> 00:06:28,601
What about yours?

123
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,960
As you know, I've been trying
to close the deal with the client.

124
00:06:33,042 --> 00:06:34,561
He has confirmed his intention

125
00:06:35,121 --> 00:06:36,162
to place an order.

126
00:06:36,322 --> 00:06:38,321
I will go and sign the contract
tomorrow morning.

127
00:06:38,681 --> 00:06:41,281
-I'm closing my first deal.
-Really?

128
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,620
Congratulations! That gift I bought for
you couldn't have come at a better time.

129
00:06:46,401 --> 00:06:47,482
You were right.

130
00:06:47,722 --> 00:06:48,922
I got my bonus.

131
00:06:49,882 --> 00:06:52,202
So, I got you a big gift immediately.

132
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:04,682
Do you like it?

133
00:07:18,002 --> 00:07:18,802
It looks good.

134
00:07:19,121 --> 00:07:21,762
You need a suit like this when
you go out to talk business.

135
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:24,882
It makes you look young
and professional.

136
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,240
You can wear it when you go
sign the contract tomorrow.

137
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:28,720
What do you think? Do you like it?

138
00:07:29,561 --> 00:07:30,361
I like it.

139
00:07:36,642 --> 00:07:37,442
Xing Xing,

140
00:07:38,914 --> 00:07:40,595
how about we be together too?

141
00:07:57,202 --> 00:07:58,322
It's still cold.

142
00:08:02,602 --> 00:08:03,642
Chilly.

143
00:08:04,521 --> 00:08:05,321
Chilly.

144
00:08:07,241 --> 00:08:08,042
Tou Tou,

145
00:08:08,681 --> 00:08:09,727
do you like this place?

146
00:08:10,202 --> 00:08:11,081
I do.

147
00:08:11,521 --> 00:08:12,561
The view is beautiful.

148
00:08:13,162 --> 00:08:14,128
The air is fresh here.

149
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,167
We can see patients during the day,

150
00:08:16,442 --> 00:08:18,321
and come here at night to sit

151
00:08:18,401 --> 00:08:19,401
and take a walk.

152
00:08:20,361 --> 00:08:22,681
Don't you think
the boss lady's cooking is really good?

153
00:08:25,561 --> 00:08:26,401
Then,

154
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:27,681
how about

155
00:08:27,762 --> 00:08:29,642
we find a place like here and

156
00:08:30,602 --> 00:08:32,440
open a medical centre there
in the future?

157
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,492
It would be perfect if it's near
the mountains and the sea.

158
00:08:34,573 --> 00:08:37,374
I can even teach you
rock climbing and diving.

159
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,320
We can also grow vegetables.

160
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,054
We'll plant whatever you like to eat.

161
00:08:42,254 --> 00:08:43,534
Most importantly,

162
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,200
nobody will tell you when to sleep
and when to wake up.

163
00:08:47,281 --> 00:08:49,202
You can sleep as late as you want.

164
00:08:49,961 --> 00:08:50,761
It's total freedom.

165
00:08:51,081 --> 00:08:51,881
What do you think?

166
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,160
What you're saying quite tempting.

167
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,521
But I still feel that

168
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,361
although living in the wild sounds free,

169
00:09:04,442 --> 00:09:05,681
the city has its own charm.

170
00:09:06,722 --> 00:09:08,761
Why? I thought you liked it here?

171
00:09:08,841 --> 00:09:10,201
I do like it here.

172
00:09:10,281 --> 00:09:12,841
I would enjoy coming here occasionally
and staying for a while.

173
00:09:13,081 --> 00:09:14,642
But if I were to live here permanently,

174
00:09:15,322 --> 00:09:16,441
I would have a problem.

175
00:09:16,521 --> 00:09:17,754
What problem would you have?

176
00:09:21,762 --> 00:09:23,722
Master and Madam aren't here.

177
00:09:24,002 --> 00:09:26,341
The medical centre and our classmates
aren't here either.

178
00:09:27,042 --> 00:09:28,281
I would have a mental problem.

179
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,760
You know,

180
00:09:33,042 --> 00:09:34,762
if we only want happiness,

181
00:09:35,202 --> 00:09:36,561
having each other is enough.

182
00:09:37,241 --> 00:09:38,801
But if we want to go far,

183
00:09:39,241 --> 00:09:40,681
we need companionship.

184
00:09:41,401 --> 00:09:43,922
Learning alone without friends leads
to narrow-mindedness and ignorance,

185
00:09:44,002 --> 00:09:44,802
am I right?

186
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,961
You're really impressive now.

187
00:09:51,361 --> 00:09:53,361
Your level is exceptionally high.

188
00:09:54,202 --> 00:09:55,642
You're so driven and ambitious.

189
00:09:56,401 --> 00:09:58,922
It's because I climbed up
from the bottom.

190
00:09:59,841 --> 00:10:01,842
So if I want to be a good successor,

191
00:10:01,922 --> 00:10:03,801
I have to work very hard,
extremely hard.

192
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,840
I need to put in a thousand times

193
00:10:04,935 --> 00:10:07,561
more effort to fulfil the
responsibilities of being a successor.

194
00:10:21,002 --> 00:10:22,161
Let me ask you a question.

195
00:10:24,842 --> 00:10:25,642
Between me

196
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,000
and TCM,

197
00:10:28,241 --> 00:10:30,121
if you had to choose one,

198
00:10:30,202 --> 00:10:31,375
what would you choose?

199
00:10:31,601 --> 00:10:32,402
TCM, of course.

200
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,840
You know that

201
00:10:34,928 --> 00:10:36,608
TCM is my entire territory.

202
00:10:40,962 --> 00:10:42,962
But you are the capital of my territory.

203
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:56,442
-Uncle Niu!
-Uncle... Uncle Niu!

204
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:59,401
-Uncle Niu.
-Are you having insomnia again?

205
00:10:59,481 --> 00:11:01,247
Do you need another acupuncture session?

206
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:02,401
No, no.

207
00:11:02,481 --> 00:11:04,642
You said your phone
fell into the river, right?

208
00:11:04,962 --> 00:11:06,601
I spent the whole day searching

209
00:11:06,681 --> 00:11:07,762
the bay today.

210
00:11:07,921 --> 00:11:09,721
You see, I finally found it.

211
00:11:10,082 --> 00:11:11,161
The plastic bag

212
00:11:11,402 --> 00:11:12,322
is still intact.

213
00:11:12,442 --> 00:11:14,241
I think your phone still works.

214
00:11:14,402 --> 00:11:15,522
Here, catch!

215
00:11:17,161 --> 00:11:18,962
No, it might fall into the river again.

216
00:11:19,161 --> 00:11:20,121
We will come and get it.

217
00:11:20,282 --> 00:11:21,328
We will come and get it.

218
00:11:21,721 --> 00:11:23,121
Okay, okay. Come and get it.

219
00:11:39,721 --> 00:11:40,900
I do like you.

220
00:11:48,161 --> 00:11:49,322
But I think

221
00:11:50,642 --> 00:11:52,002
liking each other isn't enough.

222
00:11:52,082 --> 00:11:53,562
With our current circumstances,

223
00:11:53,642 --> 00:11:55,762
there's no way we can sustain
our lives in this city.

224
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,040
Our parents' generation,

225
00:12:01,642 --> 00:12:03,562
didn't they all start from scratch?

226
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:05,394
They are all living well now,
aren't they?

227
00:12:05,908 --> 00:12:06,708
Yes,

228
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,440
their generation

229
00:12:08,522 --> 00:12:10,242
could afford to get married
based on love

230
00:12:10,322 --> 00:12:11,801
and build a life together.

231
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,401
But it's different now.
Marriage is not

232
00:12:14,481 --> 00:12:15,641
just about two individuals,

233
00:12:15,721 --> 00:12:17,161
it's about two families.

234
00:12:18,048 --> 00:12:19,567
Let's be more practical about it.

235
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:21,002
Say if we get married,

236
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:22,169
can we afford a house?

237
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,623
Can we afford a house in
the school district when we have kids?

238
00:12:25,082 --> 00:12:28,161
Our conditions can't meet the down
payment requirements in this city.

239
00:12:28,892 --> 00:12:30,241
Not to mention that
you have a younger brother

240
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:31,962
who won't come of age
for many more years.

241
00:12:36,481 --> 00:12:38,081
You can't just say

242
00:12:38,161 --> 00:12:40,420
if you can't afford a house,
you shouldn't get married.

243
00:12:41,082 --> 00:12:43,827
If you can't live in a school district,
you shouldn't have children.

244
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,960
I don't know about others,

245
00:12:48,036 --> 00:12:49,641
but for me,

246
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,600
that's what I feel.

247
00:12:56,642 --> 00:12:58,081
If being together with someone

248
00:12:58,161 --> 00:13:00,002
is more exhausting than being alone,

249
00:13:00,601 --> 00:13:01,842
then I'd rather remain single.

250
00:13:02,202 --> 00:13:04,481
Because I have already faced
the hardships of this city.

251
00:13:04,882 --> 00:13:05,882
I don't want my child

252
00:13:05,962 --> 00:13:07,282
to start off their life

253
00:13:07,522 --> 00:13:08,481
at a disadvantage.

254
00:13:10,481 --> 00:13:12,402
We can both work hard together.

255
00:13:12,601 --> 00:13:14,762
Like me,
I'm a pharmaceutical representative.

256
00:13:14,882 --> 00:13:17,561
For every deal close,
I earn a commission.

257
00:13:18,001 --> 00:13:19,694
The more deals I close, the more I earn.

258
00:13:21,282 --> 00:13:23,721
How much do you earn from one deal?

259
00:13:26,282 --> 00:13:27,475
A little over ten thousand.

260
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,361
It's not as much as some people make,

261
00:13:32,522 --> 00:13:34,041
but it's still good, right?

262
00:13:34,721 --> 00:13:36,561
I'll definitely earn more in the future.

263
00:13:37,094 --> 00:13:38,335
But as you know,

264
00:13:38,642 --> 00:13:39,442
in this city,

265
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,520
even a restroom costs over
three hundred thousand.

266
00:13:41,601 --> 00:13:43,787
You'll have to work for three years
without eating or drinking to afford it.

267
00:13:50,721 --> 00:13:51,681
That's true.

268
00:13:55,408 --> 00:13:56,488
But life is not

269
00:13:57,721 --> 00:13:59,282
a one-step process, you know?

270
00:13:59,522 --> 00:14:02,720
But when will you ever save up
enough money with your low wage?

271
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:03,641
Both our families

272
00:14:03,721 --> 00:14:05,082
have so many expenses.

273
00:14:10,161 --> 00:14:12,340
There was this maths question
I did when I was little.

274
00:14:13,762 --> 00:14:17,842
It's about
a water pipe's inlet and outlet.

275
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:19,388
At that time,

276
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,080
I thought the person
who created that question must be crazy.

277
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:23,402
But as I grew older,

278
00:14:23,522 --> 00:14:24,601
I realised that

279
00:14:25,282 --> 00:14:26,882
he wasn't asking a maths problem,

280
00:14:27,314 --> 00:14:29,514
he was presenting a real-life challenge.

281
00:14:36,721 --> 00:14:37,521
I'm sorry.

282
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:40,842
Love is too burdensome for me.

283
00:14:41,842 --> 00:14:43,442
Neither you nor I are Ren Tian Zhen,

284
00:14:43,522 --> 00:14:44,601
so we shouldn't

285
00:14:45,642 --> 00:14:48,082
be together with someone like Tou Tou.

286
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:51,122
Li Quan,

287
00:14:56,962 --> 00:14:58,161
let's be more practical.

288
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,200
We're finally back.

289
00:15:32,282 --> 00:15:33,161
We're home.

290
00:15:35,921 --> 00:15:36,721
Here, Tou Tou.

291
00:15:44,514 --> 00:15:46,161
-Where are your slippers?
-Here.

292
00:15:46,322 --> 00:15:47,321
I'll change into them.

293
00:15:47,921 --> 00:15:50,002
-Let's go inside. Let me carry it.
-It's okay.

294
00:15:50,402 --> 00:15:51,442
-Come on.
-It's not heavy.

295
00:15:51,522 --> 00:15:52,322
Let me carry it.

296
00:15:54,681 --> 00:15:55,841
-Mum.
-That scared me.

297
00:15:56,962 --> 00:15:58,762
Why are you still awake
at this hour?

298
00:16:03,601 --> 00:16:04,402
Come, Tou Tou.

299
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,120
Let me read your pulse.

300
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:08,842
Go.

301
00:16:10,082 --> 00:16:10,882
Mum,

302
00:16:11,642 --> 00:16:12,442
I...

303
00:16:17,241 --> 00:16:18,041
Hurry up.

304
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,359
I'm recovered.

305
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:23,161
I'm fine now.

306
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,599
I'm fine now.

307
00:16:35,881 --> 00:16:37,441
I have fully recovered.

308
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:43,402
I'm fine, right?

309
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,201
Remind me to write you a prescription
at the medical centre tomorrow.

310
00:16:55,282 --> 00:16:56,588
You will take medicine
for a few more days.

311
00:16:57,361 --> 00:16:59,122
-I'm not fully recovered?
-You are.

312
00:16:59,962 --> 00:17:01,315
I will adjust your lower burner.

313
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:15,840
Just now,

314
00:17:16,681 --> 00:17:18,601
my mum wouldn't say anything.
That was scary.

315
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:26,785
(The Great Heat is a season
of vigorous growth for all things.)

316
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,540
(There is a folk custom of
drinking cooling herbal tea)

317
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,960
(during the three periods of
extreme heat (Sanfu days).)

318
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,680
(There are also customs
of burning incense)

319
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,213
(and sun-drying ginger.)

320
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,928
(Great Heat)

321
00:18:25,642 --> 00:18:27,241
What are you doing? You startled me.

322
00:18:27,642 --> 00:18:28,801
Does it hurt?

323
00:18:28,962 --> 00:18:29,762
If you had...

324
00:18:30,202 --> 00:18:31,461
If you had pushed me harder,

325
00:18:32,241 --> 00:18:33,362
I would have to register
for a consultation here.

326
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,080
You know we are at the medical centre.
You shouldn't have scared me.

327
00:18:36,154 --> 00:18:38,561
But there are only two of us here.

328
00:18:39,441 --> 00:18:40,241
Why can't I?

329
00:18:40,321 --> 00:18:41,241
You can't!

330
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:43,241
What if someone walks in?

331
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,040
There is no one.
They haven't come to work.

332
00:18:45,107 --> 00:18:46,761
You can't. You really can't.

333
00:18:46,841 --> 00:18:47,922
Who can't?

334
00:18:49,042 --> 00:18:49,842
Tian Zhen,

335
00:18:51,042 --> 00:18:51,882
what's wrong?

336
00:19:06,162 --> 00:19:07,641
Are you two...

337
00:19:07,721 --> 00:19:08,802
We are not!

338
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:11,820
Peng Shi Yan, you're so annoying!

339
00:19:12,682 --> 00:19:13,761
Since I've known you,

340
00:19:13,841 --> 00:19:15,082
you keep babbling

341
00:19:15,162 --> 00:19:16,441
all sorts of nonsense.

342
00:19:17,121 --> 00:19:19,321
You make up things.

343
00:19:20,562 --> 00:19:21,362
Right?

344
00:19:22,201 --> 00:19:23,001
Yes!

345
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,680
So annoying!

346
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,188
So, you two aren't fighting?

347
00:19:30,841 --> 00:19:31,641
Something is wrong.

348
00:19:32,882 --> 00:19:34,721
Since you came back,

349
00:19:37,067 --> 00:19:39,547
the atmosphere between you

350
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:41,841
has become really different.

351
00:19:43,562 --> 00:19:44,802
What's different?

352
00:19:45,495 --> 00:19:46,615
There is

353
00:19:47,087 --> 00:19:48,847
a subtle,

354
00:19:50,248 --> 00:19:52,248
on-and-off sense of

355
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,840
hostility.

356
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,040
Did I get it right?

357
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:02,839
-Smart.
-I'm good, right?

358
00:20:03,042 --> 00:20:03,842
Very good.

359
00:20:06,402 --> 00:20:07,802
Tou, listen,

360
00:20:07,922 --> 00:20:10,202
don't hold it against
my friend, Tian Zhen, here.

361
00:20:10,282 --> 00:20:11,482
He's not a natural iceberg.

362
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,080
It's just that he comes
from a wealthy family,

363
00:20:13,162 --> 00:20:15,121
-which makes him arrogant and aloof.
-Arrogant and aloof.

364
00:20:15,201 --> 00:20:17,482
You want him to be like you,

365
00:20:17,562 --> 00:20:19,082
-but that's impossible.
-Impossible.

366
00:20:19,162 --> 00:20:20,962
So, just forgive him. Am I right?

367
00:20:21,042 --> 00:20:22,202
Forgive me. Right.

368
00:20:22,282 --> 00:20:23,082
Yes.

369
00:20:23,441 --> 00:20:24,241
Peng Shi Yan,

370
00:20:24,961 --> 00:20:26,322
you are so smart.

371
00:20:26,402 --> 00:20:27,442
I know, right?

372
00:20:27,522 --> 00:20:29,522
What's inside that head of yours?

373
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,241
You were born so smart.

374
00:20:31,443 --> 00:20:33,520
-Wisdom.
-How clever.

375
00:20:33,961 --> 00:20:35,962
So smart. Yet how come
a smart guy like you

376
00:20:36,042 --> 00:20:37,201
can't find a girlfriend?

377
00:20:38,282 --> 00:20:39,121
What a pity.

378
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,200
-A pity indeed.
-Such a pity.

379
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,359
Now you're just hurting me.

380
00:20:47,441 --> 00:20:48,282
But

381
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,879
I really can't figure out

382
00:20:49,961 --> 00:20:51,402
what's wrong with me.

383
00:20:52,562 --> 00:20:53,362
You tell me.

384
00:20:55,402 --> 00:20:56,562
I have ideals,

385
00:20:56,961 --> 00:20:57,842
morals,

386
00:20:58,036 --> 00:21:00,842
organization, discipline,
and I'm a cultured young man

387
00:21:00,922 --> 00:21:02,642
of the new era.

388
00:21:03,081 --> 00:21:04,882
Why don't girls like me?

389
00:21:05,162 --> 00:21:06,001
Right, Tou?

390
00:21:06,081 --> 00:21:07,841
Why don't girls like me?

391
00:21:09,361 --> 00:21:10,361
Sorry, bro.

392
00:21:10,441 --> 00:21:11,507
I asked the wrong person.

393
00:21:12,261 --> 00:21:13,181
Listen,

394
00:21:13,321 --> 00:21:14,121
last time...

395
00:21:14,922 --> 00:21:16,441
Hang on there.

396
00:21:17,961 --> 00:21:21,201
What do you mean the wrong person?

397
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,640
I... I'm a girl.

398
00:21:23,721 --> 00:21:25,001
You can ask me.

399
00:21:25,081 --> 00:21:26,001
You are a girl.

400
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,200
-Yes.
-But you are also my bro.

401
00:21:30,321 --> 00:21:31,602
So, I walked over.

402
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,879
When I saw the girl,

403
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,429
I told her

404
00:21:34,522 --> 00:21:35,322
every time I...

405
00:21:35,441 --> 00:21:37,802
-Don't you move! I'm going to hit you!
-Someone is mad.

406
00:21:38,042 --> 00:21:38,981
Spare him, spare him.

407
00:21:39,762 --> 00:21:40,562
Spare his life.

408
00:21:41,361 --> 00:21:42,162
Peng Shi Yan,

409
00:21:42,562 --> 00:21:43,402
I have only one word

410
00:21:43,682 --> 00:21:44,482
for you.

411
00:21:44,562 --> 00:21:46,202
-Stupid.
-Sorry?

412
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,601
I don't know about other girls,

413
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:49,961
but some girls aren't
looking for a boyfriend,

414
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:52,188
they're looking for a father
for their child.

415
00:21:52,841 --> 00:21:54,121
You're absolutely right.

416
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,439
Yang Xiao Hong said the same thing.

417
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,601
Yes, so use your brain.

418
00:21:57,682 --> 00:21:59,282
She has made it very clear to you.

419
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,680
Figure out a way now.

420
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,640
He who holds the king holds the kingdom.

421
00:22:03,797 --> 00:22:05,080
Once you take care of the child,

422
00:22:05,162 --> 00:22:07,001
won't the mother
be taken care of as well?

423
00:22:07,441 --> 00:22:08,241
The mother?

424
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,520
I like it.

425
00:22:12,282 --> 00:22:13,201
You are so sly.

426
00:22:15,521 --> 00:22:16,561
Don't take it to heart.

427
00:22:16,642 --> 00:22:17,442
Okay.

428
00:22:17,802 --> 00:22:19,522
Drink more warm water.

429
00:22:19,802 --> 00:22:21,201
Your stomach is often upset.

430
00:22:24,762 --> 00:22:26,722
What does he like?

431
00:22:27,682 --> 00:22:28,482
Yang Xiao Hong.

432
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:44,962
He thinks

433
00:22:46,441 --> 00:22:47,562
he can take Yang Xiao Hong?

434
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,001
Is it possible?

435
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,280
It's going to be arduous.

436
00:23:38,721 --> 00:23:39,767
Penny for your thoughts.

437
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,601
What's on your mind?

438
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:47,907
People come into this world,

439
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:49,922
then depart from it,

440
00:23:51,201 --> 00:23:53,361
yet there's not a trace left behind.

441
00:23:58,841 --> 00:24:00,153
You're thinking about Meng Meng?

442
00:24:01,802 --> 00:24:04,922
Everyone seems like
they're not the least bit sad.

443
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:10,960
Jian Xi,

444
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:13,981
it's not that we're not sad.

445
00:24:15,802 --> 00:24:16,881
We're all very sad.

446
00:24:16,961 --> 00:24:18,441
And like you,

447
00:24:22,721 --> 00:24:24,241
we really miss Meng Meng too.

448
00:24:28,961 --> 00:24:30,402
You have to understand,

449
00:24:32,321 --> 00:24:33,802
in the adult world,

450
00:24:36,002 --> 00:24:38,522
we can't show our sadness
on our faces every day.

451
00:24:42,042 --> 00:24:43,441
Besides, Master said that

452
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,000
the living are more important.

453
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,560
Ms Xia.

454
00:25:00,002 --> 00:25:00,802
Ms Xia,

455
00:25:00,922 --> 00:25:02,361
after Jian Xi's acupuncture
session today,

456
00:25:02,441 --> 00:25:04,441
she is entering
the herbal medicine stage, right?

457
00:25:04,562 --> 00:25:05,362
Yes.

458
00:25:05,562 --> 00:25:07,728
She will start drinking
the tile medicine tomorrow.

459
00:25:11,282 --> 00:25:12,802
I'm really looking forward to it.

460
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,000
I'm sure it will work.

461
00:25:15,114 --> 00:25:17,513
Yes, it will work.

462
00:25:18,042 --> 00:25:20,841
This herbal medicine
was personally ground,

463
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,320
-brewed, and simmered
-Yes.

464
00:25:22,402 --> 00:25:23,482
by me and Tou Tou.

465
00:25:23,562 --> 00:25:25,442
We have poured
all our blessings into it,

466
00:25:25,522 --> 00:25:26,522
so it will surely work.

467
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,159
Peng, I've thought about it.

468
00:25:29,321 --> 00:25:30,721
Even if it doesn't work,

469
00:25:30,913 --> 00:25:32,433
it won't affect our life.

470
00:25:32,534 --> 00:25:33,574
Right, Jian Xi?

471
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:35,241
You know,

472
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,880
ever since I started working here,

473
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,440
I feel so at ease.

474
00:25:39,721 --> 00:25:42,081
I feel like we've found
a sense of security.

475
00:25:43,402 --> 00:25:44,321
That's good.

476
00:25:44,522 --> 00:25:46,361
Yes. Come, drink it while it's warm.

477
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,360
Go on.

478
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,640
(Qibo Medical Centre)

479
00:26:04,562 --> 00:26:05,762
Dr Song.

480
00:26:07,868 --> 00:26:08,708
Dr Song.

481
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,440
Dr Song, it's been so long.

482
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,679
Dou Dou,

483
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,679
have you finished
your post-partum recovery?

484
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,360
Yes, last week.

485
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:18,841
I came here today
to express my gratitude

486
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,514
and bring you
some red-dyed eggs for my baby.

487
00:26:20,595 --> 00:26:21,835
Thank you.

488
00:26:21,961 --> 00:26:23,841
I also have a small request.

489
00:26:24,162 --> 00:26:25,522
You must come to

490
00:26:25,754 --> 00:26:27,273
my baby's 100-day birth party.

491
00:26:27,562 --> 00:26:29,162
He wouldn't have been born without you.

492
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,641
-Congratulations. I'll be there.
-Wonderful.

493
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,482
Hong, please give the eggs to others.

494
00:26:34,562 --> 00:26:36,082
-Okay, I got it.
-Share the happiness with them.

495
00:26:36,201 --> 00:26:37,001
Okay.

496
00:26:37,081 --> 00:26:37,961
Congratulations.

497
00:26:38,201 --> 00:26:39,641
Let me take a look at you.

498
00:26:39,721 --> 00:26:41,522
-Okay.
-Red egg.

499
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:45,961
-So many eggs.
-I saw the video you uploaded

500
00:26:46,361 --> 00:26:47,693
on your Moments a few days ago.

501
00:26:48,562 --> 00:26:50,241
Your baby is so cute.

502
00:26:50,321 --> 00:26:52,602
He's a naughty boy.

503
00:26:52,682 --> 00:26:53,482
Yeah?

504
00:26:53,562 --> 00:26:54,402
Here.

505
00:26:55,682 --> 00:26:56,482
Have one too.

506
00:26:58,108 --> 00:26:58,948
Am I okay?

507
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,600
You're recovering well.

508
00:27:02,441 --> 00:27:03,241
Here.

509
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,201
Your pulse is good too.

510
00:27:09,308 --> 00:27:10,188
And

511
00:27:10,936 --> 00:27:12,722
you no longer have symptoms
of Cold Uterus.

512
00:27:12,901 --> 00:27:13,701
Yes.

513
00:27:14,361 --> 00:27:15,682
You had Cold Uterus before?

514
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,481
Isn't it difficult
to conceive with Cold Uterus?

515
00:27:18,562 --> 00:27:21,001
Yes, my lower abdomen
used to feel icy cold,

516
00:27:21,081 --> 00:27:22,361
like an ice pop.

517
00:27:22,896 --> 00:27:24,842
When I tried in vitro fertilization
at that time,

518
00:27:24,922 --> 00:27:26,441
I just couldn't get pregnant.

519
00:27:26,642 --> 00:27:28,081
But then I met Dr Song.

520
00:27:28,162 --> 00:27:30,682
Dr Song helped me
change my lifestyle habits

521
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,240
and taught me to wear warm cotton pants.

522
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,721
After changing those habits,
I naturally became pregnant.

523
00:27:34,802 --> 00:27:36,722
-Really?
-So you see, TCM is not just

524
00:27:36,868 --> 00:27:37,828
about treating diseases,

525
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,268
it's about nurturing and
maintaining health, caring for life.

526
00:27:40,682 --> 00:27:42,322
-You see.
-Right?

527
00:27:42,682 --> 00:27:43,841
By the way, Dr Song,

528
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:45,082
I have a close friend

529
00:27:45,162 --> 00:27:46,081
who wants to

530
00:27:46,241 --> 00:27:47,841
have a baby this year.

531
00:27:48,168 --> 00:27:49,688
Learning from my experience,

532
00:27:49,802 --> 00:27:50,722
she wants

533
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:52,402
to start preparing for conception.

534
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,040
Could you let me know
when you're available?

535
00:27:54,127 --> 00:27:55,568
I'll have her come here to see you.

536
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:57,001
-Sure.
-Okay.

537
00:27:57,081 --> 00:27:58,321
Thank you so much.

538
00:27:58,481 --> 00:28:00,321
Madam, what do we need to do

539
00:28:00,562 --> 00:28:01,841
for pre-pregnancy preparations?

540
00:28:02,201 --> 00:28:04,082
First, you should ask yourself

541
00:28:04,162 --> 00:28:05,802
why you want to prepare for pregnancy.

542
00:28:06,321 --> 00:28:08,321
Then we can discuss
what needs to be done.

543
00:28:08,481 --> 00:28:09,602
Mr Ren,

544
00:28:09,682 --> 00:28:13,201
isn't preparing for pregnancy
a natural thing?

545
00:28:14,682 --> 00:28:15,682
You see,

546
00:28:15,802 --> 00:28:16,602
we often say

547
00:28:16,682 --> 00:28:18,001
"learning life".

548
00:28:18,081 --> 00:28:19,162
What does it mean?

549
00:28:19,321 --> 00:28:20,441
It has two meanings.

550
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,999
The first is

551
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:24,361
about living a sunny life,

552
00:28:24,441 --> 00:28:27,481
and the second is about
the continuity of life,

553
00:28:27,721 --> 00:28:29,241
passing it on
from generation to generation.

554
00:28:30,321 --> 00:28:33,400
Everyone says that
getting pregnant is the easiest thing.

555
00:28:33,501 --> 00:28:34,942
But that's not true.

556
00:28:36,441 --> 00:28:37,402
Yes.

557
00:28:37,522 --> 00:28:38,322
Come.

558
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:40,400
Preparing for pregnancy

559
00:28:40,562 --> 00:28:41,761
is not something

560
00:28:41,841 --> 00:28:43,961
you start when you decide

561
00:28:44,402 --> 00:28:46,042
to get pregnant.

562
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,720
It requires

563
00:28:47,914 --> 00:28:49,914
early preparation.

564
00:28:50,755 --> 00:28:53,194
It's like studying for exams
when we were little.

565
00:28:53,361 --> 00:28:55,922
You can't cram at the last minute.

566
00:28:56,282 --> 00:28:56,881
-Right?
-Yes.

567
00:28:56,961 --> 00:28:57,761
Yes.

568
00:28:58,042 --> 00:28:59,201
I remember in the past,

569
00:28:59,282 --> 00:29:01,042
I used to eat ice cream

570
00:29:01,282 --> 00:29:02,442
and drink cold beverages.

571
00:29:02,522 --> 00:29:04,641
I wore clothes
that exposed my legs and back.

572
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,121
My Dazhui and Sanyinjiao acupoints

573
00:29:07,201 --> 00:29:08,482
were fully exposed.

574
00:29:08,562 --> 00:29:10,722
So, when I first came
to this medical centre

575
00:29:10,802 --> 00:29:11,922
and saw Dr Song,

576
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,481
I realised it was time
for me to repay my debts.

577
00:29:13,562 --> 00:29:16,821
I needed to clear the coldness I had
accumulated over the past decade or so.

578
00:29:17,562 --> 00:29:18,362
Madam,

579
00:29:19,042 --> 00:29:20,995
please don't blame me for
disagreeing with you.

580
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,279
Our diagnosis needs
to be based on evidence.

581
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,360
We can't see or touch
this Cold Uterus condition.

582
00:29:26,522 --> 00:29:28,201
You just touched someone's pulse

583
00:29:28,441 --> 00:29:29,721
and said she had Cold Uterus.

584
00:29:29,802 --> 00:29:31,201
How can you prove it?

585
00:29:31,522 --> 00:29:34,321
Besides, I've seen
those foreign pregnant women

586
00:29:34,447 --> 00:29:37,048
who still drink a glass of cold water
after giving birth.

587
00:29:37,162 --> 00:29:38,121
And they are fine.

588
00:29:38,674 --> 00:29:41,475
Our class leader here
likes to disagree with us.

589
00:29:43,321 --> 00:29:44,967
Have you ever experienced menstruation?

590
00:29:45,173 --> 00:29:47,053
Then how can you say
Cold Uterus doesn't exist?

591
00:29:48,441 --> 00:29:49,721
A woman's menstrual cycle

592
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,279
is a normal physiological response.

593
00:29:52,441 --> 00:29:54,202
Nowadays, many women experience

594
00:29:54,282 --> 00:29:56,802
pain here and there
during their periods,

595
00:29:57,594 --> 00:29:58,394
which is abnormal.

596
00:29:59,402 --> 00:30:00,321
Tou Tou, copy this.

597
00:30:00,402 --> 00:30:01,241
Next month,

598
00:30:01,321 --> 00:30:03,081
we are planning
to invite some specialists

599
00:30:03,282 --> 00:30:04,642
in gynaecology and paediatrics

600
00:30:04,802 --> 00:30:08,601
to hold a pilot
pre-pregnancy preparation camp here.

601
00:30:09,961 --> 00:30:12,042
You can invite your friend
to come and take a look.

602
00:30:12,162 --> 00:30:14,441
If she finds it helpful,
she can sign up.

603
00:30:14,802 --> 00:30:15,842
Thank you.

604
00:30:15,922 --> 00:30:16,722
I will sign up.

605
00:30:17,201 --> 00:30:18,241
Hang on.

606
00:30:18,321 --> 00:30:20,761
You don't even have a boyfriend.
Why do you want to sign up?

607
00:30:20,841 --> 00:30:22,961
Didn't you hear what Madam just said?

608
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:24,721
I must prepare in advance.

609
00:30:25,042 --> 00:30:26,562
When the channel is formed,
the water will naturally flow.

610
00:30:26,642 --> 00:30:28,121
-Right, Madam?
-Yes.

611
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,880
Right, right. Madam,

612
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:31,561
do men also need
to prepare for pregnancy?

613
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,720
Of course.

614
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,140
Then, I'm signing up too.

615
00:30:35,162 --> 00:30:36,522
Always be prepared, right?

616
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,359
Do I also need
to quit smoking and drinking?

617
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,080
Quitting smoking and drinking
is the basic requirement.

618
00:30:41,961 --> 00:30:45,361
If you want to contribute
to your family and society,

619
00:30:45,522 --> 00:30:47,201
it's not something that
can be achieved with just a sperm.

620
00:30:48,042 --> 00:30:49,402
A benevolent person loves others.

621
00:30:50,522 --> 00:30:52,042
If you want to be a benevolent person,

622
00:30:52,802 --> 00:30:55,081
the first lesson is
to learn how to love others.

623
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,720
Mum.

624
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:02,840
Mum.

625
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:09,241
Could you get me a blanket?

626
00:31:09,321 --> 00:31:11,321
I feel cold under my legs.

627
00:31:17,367 --> 00:31:19,208
You said you feel cold under your legs?

628
00:31:19,922 --> 00:31:20,922
Professor Ren!

629
00:31:21,162 --> 00:31:22,522
Professor Ren, did you hear that?

630
00:31:22,642 --> 00:31:24,081
Jian Xi said her legs were cold.

631
00:31:24,321 --> 00:31:25,321
She feels something.

632
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,721
You really feel something?

633
00:31:30,802 --> 00:31:32,961
Jian Xi, do you feel your legs?

634
00:31:33,562 --> 00:31:34,402
Your legs are cold.

635
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,641
I feel as if they were being

636
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,480
blown by winds.

637
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,600
Amazing.

638
00:31:38,682 --> 00:31:40,201
The treatment is working
before she even drinks the medicine.

639
00:31:42,282 --> 00:31:43,082
Come.

640
00:31:43,762 --> 00:31:44,736
Let me read your pulse.

641
00:32:00,201 --> 00:32:01,682
Your pulse is better than before.

642
00:32:03,201 --> 00:32:04,441
That's a good sign.

643
00:32:05,562 --> 00:32:06,441
Professor Ren,

644
00:32:07,321 --> 00:32:08,121
thank you.

645
00:32:09,201 --> 00:32:11,081
You really didn't lie to me.

646
00:32:11,321 --> 00:32:13,402
You told me to have faith.

647
00:32:14,721 --> 00:32:15,882
I have to have faith.

648
00:32:19,042 --> 00:32:19,842
You are right.

649
00:32:20,961 --> 00:32:22,121
You must have faith.

650
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,895
"May there be no more diseases on earth
so that no medicine will be needed"

651
00:32:50,002 --> 00:32:50,802
Master,

652
00:32:52,081 --> 00:32:54,162
Bone Zhu probably
went too far this time.

653
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,360
He only dared to tell you
after he was hospitalized.

654
00:32:56,441 --> 00:32:57,827
He was afraid you would scold him.

655
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,520
Hello, Zhu.

656
00:33:06,562 --> 00:33:07,441
(Professor Ren.)

657
00:33:08,802 --> 00:33:09,602
(Hello.)

658
00:33:11,162 --> 00:33:12,841
I'm Zhu Chang Ming's wife.

659
00:33:14,694 --> 00:33:15,614
Zhu

660
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,681
is dying.

661
00:33:19,042 --> 00:33:21,441
(He'd like you to come see him.)

662
00:33:32,042 --> 00:33:34,042
How did he get himself into this state?

663
00:33:46,802 --> 00:33:47,802
Are you okay?

664
00:33:57,802 --> 00:33:58,602
Professor Ren.

665
00:33:59,841 --> 00:34:02,121
How did you get yourself
into this state?

666
00:34:04,282 --> 00:34:06,241
I really regret it.

667
00:34:08,081 --> 00:34:08,881
I really do.

668
00:34:12,201 --> 00:34:13,201
Professor Ren.

669
00:34:17,161 --> 00:34:19,001
I really regret it.

670
00:34:19,402 --> 00:34:20,562
Help me.

671
00:34:21,882 --> 00:34:22,841
If I can recover,

672
00:34:24,002 --> 00:34:25,321
I'll be a good man.

673
00:34:26,081 --> 00:34:27,241
Don't be afraid.

674
00:34:28,681 --> 00:34:29,720
You need to let go.

675
00:34:32,081 --> 00:34:33,402
There's no need to regret.

676
00:34:33,522 --> 00:34:35,441
But I'm so scared.

677
00:34:38,828 --> 00:34:39,948
Please help me.

678
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,240
I'm dying.

679
00:34:57,002 --> 00:34:58,282
This is a bead.

680
00:34:59,135 --> 00:35:01,574
It was given to me by one of my masters.

681
00:35:03,002 --> 00:35:04,481
I'm giving it to you now.

682
00:35:06,481 --> 00:35:07,441
Keep it with you.

683
00:35:08,241 --> 00:35:09,321
It will illuminate the path

684
00:35:10,841 --> 00:35:12,162
you're about to embark on.

685
00:35:12,762 --> 00:35:13,801
You won't be afraid then.

686
00:35:35,081 --> 00:35:35,881
Professor Ren,

687
00:35:38,162 --> 00:35:39,321
when I'm gone,

688
00:35:41,162 --> 00:35:43,161
will you take care of my family?

689
00:35:44,921 --> 00:35:45,721
Don't worry.

690
00:35:47,322 --> 00:35:48,421
It is my responsibility

691
00:35:49,282 --> 00:35:50,362
to take care of people.

692
00:35:57,082 --> 00:35:57,882
Don't be afraid.

693
00:35:59,401 --> 00:36:00,201
Thank you.

694
00:36:44,721 --> 00:36:45,961
Why aren't you saying anything?

695
00:36:53,161 --> 00:36:54,241
I just didn't expect

696
00:36:56,921 --> 00:36:58,441
to encounter death.

697
00:36:59,954 --> 00:37:01,794
I wasn't ready
to say goodbye to him yet.

698
00:37:04,961 --> 00:37:08,042
We not only need to be prepared
to say goodbye to others

699
00:37:09,241 --> 00:37:12,762
but also to ourselves.

700
00:37:16,161 --> 00:37:16,961
Master,

701
00:37:18,762 --> 00:37:20,241
I'm still young.

702
00:37:21,641 --> 00:37:22,441
Tou Tou,

703
00:37:23,401 --> 00:37:24,842
in life, there are five blessings.

704
00:37:25,921 --> 00:37:26,802
Longevity,

705
00:37:27,602 --> 00:37:28,402
wealth,

706
00:37:29,161 --> 00:37:30,042
good health,

707
00:37:30,881 --> 00:37:32,002
cultivating virtues,

708
00:37:32,681 --> 00:37:33,860
and passing the final test.

709
00:37:34,721 --> 00:37:36,974
Is passing the final test
referring to a peaceful death?

710
00:37:37,187 --> 00:37:37,987
Yes.

711
00:37:38,762 --> 00:37:40,002
A peaceful death

712
00:37:40,082 --> 00:37:43,401
signifies passing the final test

713
00:37:43,522 --> 00:37:44,322
of life.

714
00:37:45,881 --> 00:37:46,921
Remember, Tou Tou,

715
00:37:47,875 --> 00:37:48,994
you must prepare

716
00:37:49,247 --> 00:37:52,527
for the final test throughout your life.

717
00:37:53,608 --> 00:37:55,168
You are young now.

718
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:58,962
But when you are in middle age,
and in old age,

719
00:37:59,042 --> 00:38:00,641
you must not make any mistakes.

720
00:38:01,641 --> 00:38:03,334
When it's time
to depart from this world,

721
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,160
you will find peace

722
00:38:06,102 --> 00:38:07,021
and have no fear.

723
00:38:16,914 --> 00:38:17,714
I understand now.

724
00:38:19,762 --> 00:38:20,775
What do you understand?

725
00:38:22,802 --> 00:38:25,042
I understand why you
brought me there to see Zhu.

726
00:38:25,981 --> 00:38:27,221
Zhu and Meng Meng,

727
00:38:28,602 --> 00:38:29,721
throughout their lives,

728
00:38:31,441 --> 00:38:33,201
they didn't know why they came,

729
00:38:35,707 --> 00:38:37,507
why they would leave,

730
00:38:40,201 --> 00:38:41,921
and even who they were

731
00:38:43,602 --> 00:38:44,881
or where they were heading.

732
00:38:48,241 --> 00:38:50,562
So, you want me
to start contemplating now.

733
00:38:53,721 --> 00:38:55,441
I just want you to focus on the road.

734
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:19,680
(Qibo Medical Centre)

735
00:39:22,314 --> 00:39:23,114
Tao Zi,

736
00:39:23,762 --> 00:39:25,481
are you sure this is the place?

737
00:39:26,201 --> 00:39:27,321
Yes, it is.

738
00:39:27,401 --> 00:39:30,082
It matched the address and name
given to us by Dr Ren.

739
00:39:30,441 --> 00:39:31,321
Good.

740
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,720
Are you here for a consultation?

741
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,721
-Do you have an appointment?
-Hi, we're here to see Dr Ren.

742
00:39:35,842 --> 00:39:37,161
Yes, we're here to
see Miracle Doctor, Dr Ren.

743
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:39,042
Professor Ren arrived quite early today.

744
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,160
You came at a right time.

745
00:39:40,201 --> 00:39:42,042
-Come on. I'll take you to him.
-Thank you.

746
00:39:43,921 --> 00:39:45,082
We finally found him.

747
00:39:48,842 --> 00:39:49,642
I'm exhausted.

748
00:39:50,928 --> 00:39:51,967
Professor Ren,

749
00:39:52,082 --> 00:39:54,082
two of your old patients
are here to see you.

750
00:39:55,781 --> 00:39:56,641
Not him, not him.

751
00:39:56,921 --> 00:39:58,562
We only want to see Dr Ren.

752
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,561
That's right. The Miracle Doctor
we are looking for

753
00:40:00,642 --> 00:40:02,362
is younger and more handsome than him.

754
00:40:02,602 --> 00:40:04,721
Yes. Dr Ren is a very good doctor.

755
00:40:05,161 --> 00:40:06,654
Since he's not here, let's go then.

756
00:40:07,042 --> 00:40:07,842
Uncle Niu.

757
00:40:08,241 --> 00:40:09,602
-Tao Zi.
-Dr Ren!

758
00:40:10,002 --> 00:40:11,721
-Dr Ren.
-What brings you here?

759
00:40:12,721 --> 00:40:14,881
We came here today
specifically to thank you.

760
00:40:15,002 --> 00:40:17,242
You see, I also brought you
some local specialities.

761
00:40:17,322 --> 00:40:18,282
You shouldn't have.

762
00:40:18,721 --> 00:40:21,641
I was thinking to ask you
to take a look at me too.

763
00:40:21,721 --> 00:40:23,682
You see, you almost healed me.

764
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,000
No problem, I'll have my father
take a look at you.

765
00:40:25,082 --> 00:40:26,082
No, no.

766
00:40:26,322 --> 00:40:27,481
We want you.

767
00:40:27,562 --> 00:40:28,881
We came here for you.

768
00:40:28,961 --> 00:40:30,561
You don't understand.
My dad is a really good doctor.

769
00:40:30,641 --> 00:40:31,641
I have consulted

770
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:33,322
several older doctors before,

771
00:40:33,562 --> 00:40:36,002
but I didn't share a connection
with them like I did with you.

772
00:40:37,161 --> 00:40:38,681
You are already here.

773
00:40:38,802 --> 00:40:40,242
And you won't let me take
a look at you. Will you regret it later?

774
00:40:40,322 --> 00:40:41,282
I won't, I won't.

775
00:40:41,362 --> 00:40:43,122
I won't charge you.

776
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,721
No, no. We only trust Dr Ren.

777
00:40:45,921 --> 00:40:47,562
That's right. We only trust Dr Ren.

778
00:40:59,002 --> 00:41:00,322
Miracle Doctor?

779
00:41:06,522 --> 00:41:07,562
Why are you laughing?

780
00:41:11,881 --> 00:41:12,762
Miracle Doctor.

781
00:41:12,921 --> 00:41:14,681
Come, try this dried persimmon.

782
00:41:14,881 --> 00:41:15,762
It's delicious.

783
00:41:16,042 --> 00:41:16,842
It's cold.

784
00:41:18,507 --> 00:41:19,947
Cold?

785
00:41:20,401 --> 00:41:21,842
You're disappointed, huh?

786
00:41:23,082 --> 00:41:26,042
This is from the fellow villager who
came to Tian Zhen for consultation.

787
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,401
He brought this from his hometown.

788
00:41:28,802 --> 00:41:31,201
It's a heartfelt gesture, all warmth.

789
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:32,282
I'll try it then.

790
00:41:32,362 --> 00:41:34,041
Try this one. Here.

791
00:41:41,122 --> 00:41:42,282
Feeling defeated, huh?

792
00:41:44,762 --> 00:41:46,082
Dr Junior Ren is

793
00:41:48,762 --> 00:41:51,241
better than Professor Ren.

794
00:41:52,122 --> 00:41:53,762
That means I educated him well.

795
00:41:54,681 --> 00:41:55,961
I'm still better than him.

796
00:41:58,554 --> 00:42:00,675
Will it kill you
to praise your son a little?

797
00:42:02,322 --> 00:42:03,681
I think

798
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,401
our previous teaching methods,

799
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,000
like staying in the medical centre
and seeing patients, are not effective.

800
00:42:10,082 --> 00:42:12,522
Our son should find his own path.

801
00:42:13,401 --> 00:42:15,041
He needs to accumulate
medical affinity.

802
00:42:15,082 --> 00:42:16,275
What is medical affinity?

803
00:42:17,042 --> 00:42:18,748
It means accumulating
merits and virtues.

804
00:42:20,161 --> 00:42:23,082
Through the provision of free
medical service for three to five years,

805
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,281
patients will come to him voluntarily.

806
00:42:28,161 --> 00:42:29,282
I agree.

807
00:42:30,002 --> 00:42:30,802
Really.

808
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:34,227
We should let them go to
the countryside to be barefoot doctors,

809
00:42:34,641 --> 00:42:35,522
right?

810
00:42:35,802 --> 00:42:38,002
When they face various
difficult and complicated cases,

811
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,840
they will find solutions on their own.

812
00:42:39,921 --> 00:42:42,441
This way, they will quickly
become skilled at their work.

813
00:42:46,554 --> 00:42:48,153
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

814
00:42:48,234 --> 00:42:49,634
(are referenced from relevant
traditional Chinese medicine books)

815
00:42:49,721 --> 00:42:50,920
