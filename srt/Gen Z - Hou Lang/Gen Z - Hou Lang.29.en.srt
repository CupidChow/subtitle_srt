1
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,320
Xin Zheng didn't even look at you.

2
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:09,680
When he came to our house,

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,040
he went straight to his master's study.

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,877
And someone here

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,237
kept bringing in apples

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,480
and tea.

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:19,880
That's not true.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,800
I...

9
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,640
I was just showing filial piety
to my father.

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,477
So now that he's our son-in-law,

11
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,680
you're no longer showing
filial piety to your father?

12
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,520
Why are you so annoying?

13
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,837
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

14
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:34,877
Okay, okay.

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,200
I'll stop. You're not mad anymore.
I'm going inside.

16
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,597
Don't go, don't go.

17
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,640
I'm still mad. I'm still mad.

18
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,880
You said

19
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,680
he was acting like a child.

20
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,240
but you are the one
who is still acting like a child.

21
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,960
I just don't want to grow up.

22
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,480
I've been worrying about you
all my life.

23
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,157
All right now.

24
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,080
Okay.

25
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,240
Cheers.

26
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,680
I can see that

27
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,640
you are in a really good mood today.

28
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,437
How can I not be in a good mood
when I got two good news today?

29
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,600
You got your bonus today?

30
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,640
Guess again.

31
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,960
What's better than getting a bonus?

32
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,840
Tou Tou called me.

33
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,400
What did they say?

34
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,437
I've been busy
dealing with that client.

35
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,037
I haven't had time to visit
the medical centre.

36
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,600
I'm worried about Tian Zhen.

37
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,957
Meng Meng's death hit him hard.

38
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,317
He's having a hard time getting over it.

39
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,437
Don't worry.

40
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,037
Ren Tian Zhen and Sun Tou Tou

41
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,077
are doing well now, very well.

42
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,560
Especially him, he's busy.

43
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,640
Busy with dating.

44
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,160
Who... Who's dating?

45
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,320
Tian Zhen.

46
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,957
Tian Zhen is dating someone?

47
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,440
It hasn't been that long since
Meng Meng passed away. Has he no heart?

48
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,037
He doesn't like Meng Meng.

49
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,160
He likes someone else.

50
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,120
Who?

51
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,437
I don't have kids.
I don't need a tutor.

52
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,757
I don't want to invest in funds
or buy insurance.

53
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,280
And I didn't order anything lately.

54
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,680
It's me.

55
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,640
I've only been gone for a few days.
Have you forgotten me already?

56
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,360
Tou Tou?

57
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,877
Did you just remember to call me?

58
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,240
Where have you been? I couldn't
find you at the medical centre.

59
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,200
Why are you laughing?

60
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,840
Want to hear
my Hollywood blockbuster story?

61
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,480
Hollywood blockbuster story?

62
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,640
Go on.

63
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,400
It's okay.

64
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,077
Come. Let me read your pulse.

65
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,080
I found my original aspiration.

66
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,800
What original aspiration?

67
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,077
You don't remember?

68
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,280
I've told you before.

69
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,080
What was my original aspiration
when I decided to study TCM?

70
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,440
Your original aspiration was...

71
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,197
Do you know what matters?

72
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,080
What?

73
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,957
There is a handsome guy there.

74
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,920
He's tall, thin and fair-skinned.

75
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,000
And he's difficult.

76
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,080
Tou Tou!

77
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,480
Really?

78
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,077
Really? Why would I lie to you?

79
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,677
Why would I lie about
something like this?

80
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,520
How did you get him to date you?

81
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,200
Tian Xing Xing,

82
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,600
he could be the one
who asked me to date him.

83
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,640
Why did you presume
that I asked him first?

84
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,200
I've noticed that you possess
a magical power.

85
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,520
A magical power?

86
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,720
What do you mean?

87
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,557
I could tell from the way
you win at claw machines.

88
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,600
Your wishes always come true.

89
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:37,960
Could it...

90
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,560
Could it be that

91
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,360
I have inherited my master's skill?

92
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,760
What skill?

93
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,157
He mentioned before that

94
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,400
he has a special ability.

95
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,517
This is a line from Questions of
Organic and Fundamental Nature.

96
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,037
It means that as long as you cleanse

97
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,517
both internally and externally,

98
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,120
you can achieve a state
of transcendence like me,

99
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,480
capable of travelling

100
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,000
anywhere you want.

101
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,240
And all my dreams will come true.

102
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,560
I really didn't see it coming
with those two.

103
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:26,000
Tian Zhen, that brat,
didn't even mention it to me.

104
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,920
I must call him
and criticize him for this.

105
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,840
Don't.

106
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,637
They are on their honeymoon
and spending alone time together.

107
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,686
Don't disturb them.

108
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:33,717
By the way,

109
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,000
you can't tell anyone
about their relationship.

110
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,960
I won't tell anyone.

111
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,200
I will keep it to myself.

112
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,277
Especially your friend, Peng Yu Yan.

113
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,480
What's his name again?

114
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,520
Peng Shi Yan.

115
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,760
You mustn't tell him.

116
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,400
He's got loose lips.

117
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,080
I won't tell him.

118
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,600
Okay.

119
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,360
That's my good news.

120
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,480
What about yours?

121
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,837
As you know, I've been trying
to close the deal with the client.

122
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,440
He has confirmed his intention

123
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,040
to place an order.

124
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,200
I will go and sign the contract
tomorrow morning.

125
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,160
-I'm closing my first deal.
-Really?

126
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,480
Congratulations! That gift I bought for
you couldn't have come at a better time.

127
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,360
You were right.

128
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,800
I got my bonus.

129
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,080
So, I got you a big gift immediately.

130
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,560
Do you like it?

131
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,680
It looks good.

132
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,640
You need a suit like this when
you go out to talk business.

133
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,760
It makes you look young
and professional.

134
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,077
You can wear it when you go
sign the contract tomorrow.

135
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,600
What do you think? Do you like it?

136
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,240
I like it.

137
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,320
Xing Xing,

138
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,440
how about we be together too?

139
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,200
It's still cold.

140
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,520
Chilly.

141
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,200
Chilly.

142
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,920
Tou Tou,

143
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,600
do you like this place?

144
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,960
I do.

145
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,440
The view is beautiful.

146
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,000
The air is fresh here.

147
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,040
We can see patients during the day,

148
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,197
and come here at night to sit

149
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,280
and take a walk.

150
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,560
Don't you think
the boss lady's cooking is really good?

151
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,280
Then,

152
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,557
how about

153
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,520
we find a place like here and

154
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,317
open a medical centre there
in the future?

155
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,357
It would be perfect if it's near
the mountains and the sea.

156
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,240
I can even teach you
rock climbing and diving.

157
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,197
We can also grow vegetables.

158
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,920
We'll plant whatever you like to eat.

159
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,400
Most importantly,

160
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,077
nobody will tell you when to sleep
and when to wake up.

161
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,080
You can sleep as late as you want.

162
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,640
It's total freedom.

163
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,760
What do you think?

164
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,040
What you're saying quite tempting.

165
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,400
But I still feel that

166
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,237
although living in the wild sounds free,

167
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,560
the city has its own charm.

168
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,637
Why? I thought you liked it here?

169
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,077
I do like it here.

170
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,720
I would enjoy coming here occasionally
and staying for a while.

171
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,520
But if I were to live here permanently,

172
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,317
I would have a problem.

173
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,600
What problem would you have?

174
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,600
Master and Madam aren't here.

175
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,200
The medical centre and our classmates
aren't here either.

176
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,160
I would have a mental problem.

177
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,640
You know,

178
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,640
if we only want happiness,

179
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,440
having each other is enough.

180
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,680
But if we want to go far,

181
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,560
we need companionship.

182
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,797
Learning alone without friends leads
to narrow-mindedness and ignorance,

183
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,680
am I right?

184
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,840
You're really impressive now.

185
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,240
Your level is exceptionally high.

186
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,520
You're so driven and ambitious.

187
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,800
It's because I climbed up
from the bottom.

188
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,717
So if I want to be a good successor,

189
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,677
I have to work very hard,
extremely hard.

190
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,717
I need to put in a thousand times

191
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,440
more effort to fulfil the
responsibilities of being a successor.

192
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,040
Let me ask you a question.

193
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,520
Between me

194
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,880
and TCM,

195
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,997
if you had to choose one,

196
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,240
what would you choose?

197
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,280
TCM, of course.

198
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,717
You know that

199
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,480
TCM is my entire territory.

200
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,840
But you are the capital of my territory.

201
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,317
-Uncle Niu!
-Uncle... Uncle Niu!

202
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,356
-Uncle Niu.
-Are you having insomnia again?

203
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,017
Do you need another acupuncture session?

204
00:09:26,101 --> 00:09:27,277
No, no.

205
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,520
You said your phone
fell into the river, right?

206
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,517
I spent the whole day searching

207
00:09:31,619 --> 00:09:32,699
the bay today.

208
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,600
You see, I finally found it.

209
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,040
The plastic bag

210
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,200
is still intact.

211
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,120
I think your phone still works.

212
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,400
Here, catch!

213
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,840
No, it might fall into the river again.

214
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,000
We will come and get it.

215
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,200
We will come and get it.

216
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,000
Okay, okay. Come and get it.

217
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,760
I do like you.

218
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,200
But I think

219
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,877
liking each other isn't enough.

220
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,437
With our current circumstances,

221
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,640
there's no way we can sustain
our lives in this city.

222
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,920
Our parents' generation,

223
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,440
didn't they all start from scratch?

224
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,240
They are all living well now,
aren't they?

225
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,560
Yes,

226
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,317
their generation

227
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,117
could afford to get married
based on love

228
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,680
and build a life together.

229
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,277
But it's different now.
Marriage is not

230
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,517
just about two individuals,

231
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,040
it's about two families.

232
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,440
Let's be more practical about it.

233
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,880
Say if we get married,

234
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,037
can we afford a house?

235
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,480
Can we afford a house in
the school district when we have kids?

236
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:53,040
Our conditions can't meet the down
payment requirements in this city.

237
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,077
Not to mention that
you have a younger brother

238
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,840
who won't come of age
for many more years.

239
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,957
You can't just say

240
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,280
if you can't afford a house,
you shouldn't get married.

241
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,680
If you can't live in a school district,
you shouldn't have children.

242
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,797
I don't know about others,

243
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,520
but for me,

244
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,480
that's what I feel.

245
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,957
If being together with someone

246
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,880
is more exhausting than being alone,

247
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,720
then I'd rather remain single.

248
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,360
Because I have already faced
the hardships of this city.

249
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,757
I don't want my child

250
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,160
to start off their life

251
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,360
at a disadvantage.

252
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,280
We can both work hard together.

253
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,640
Like me,
I'm a pharmaceutical representative.

254
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,440
For every deal close,
I earn a commission.

255
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,560
The more deals I close, the more I earn.

256
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,600
How much do you earn from one deal?

257
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,320
A little over ten thousand.

258
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,240
It's not as much as some people make,

259
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,920
but it's still good, right?

260
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,440
I'll definitely earn more in the future.

261
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,200
But as you know,

262
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,317
in this city,

263
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,397
even a restroom costs over
three hundred thousand.

264
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,640
You'll have to work for three years
without eating or drinking to afford it.

265
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,560
That's true.

266
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,360
But life is not

267
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,160
a one-step process, you know?

268
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,597
But when will you ever save up
enough money with your low wage?

269
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,517
Both our families

270
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,960
have so many expenses.

271
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,200
There was this maths question
I did when I was little.

272
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:42,720
It's about
a water pipe's inlet and outlet.

273
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,240
At that time,

274
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,957
I thought the person
who created that question must be crazy.

275
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,280
But as I grew older,

276
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,480
I realised that

277
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,760
he wasn't asking a maths problem,

278
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,360
he was presenting a real-life challenge.

279
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,400
I'm sorry.

280
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,720
Love is too burdensome for me.

281
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,317
Neither you nor I are Ren Tian Zhen,

282
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,480
so we shouldn't

283
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,960
be together with someone like Tou Tou.

284
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,000
Li Quan,

285
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,040
let's be more practical.

286
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,077
We're finally back.

287
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,040
We're home.

288
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,600
Here, Tou Tou.

289
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,040
-Where are your slippers?
-Here.

290
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,200
I'll change into them.

291
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,880
-Let's go inside. Let me carry it.
-It's okay.

292
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,317
-Come on.
-It's not heavy.

293
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,200
Let me carry it.

294
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,720
-Mum.
-That scared me.

295
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,640
Why are you still awake
at this hour?

296
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,280
Come, Tou Tou.

297
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,000
Let me read your pulse.

298
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,720
Go.

299
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,760
Mum,

300
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,320
I...

301
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:42,920
Hurry up.

302
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,200
I'm recovered.

303
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,040
I'm fine now.

304
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,440
I'm fine now.

305
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,320
I have fully recovered.

306
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,280
I'm fine, right?

307
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,077
Remind me to write you a prescription
at the medical centre tomorrow.

308
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,440
You will take medicine
for a few more days.

309
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,000
-I'm not fully recovered?
-You are.

310
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,160
I will adjust your lower burner.

311
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,720
Just now,

312
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,480
my mum wouldn't say anything.
That was scary.

313
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,640
(The Great Heat is a season
of vigorous growth for all things.)

314
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,397
(There is a folk custom of
drinking cooling herbal tea)

315
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,840
(during the three periods of
extreme heat (Sanfu days).)

316
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,560
(There are also customs
of burning incense)

317
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,080
(and sun-drying ginger.)

318
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:09,800
(Great Heat)

319
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,120
What are you doing? You startled me.

320
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,680
Does it hurt?

321
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,640
If you had...

322
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,320
If you had pushed me harder,

323
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,237
I would have to register
for a consultation here.

324
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,917
You know we are at the medical centre.
You shouldn't have scared me.

325
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,440
But there are only two of us here.

326
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,117
Why can't I?

327
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,117
You can't!

328
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,117
What if someone walks in?

329
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,877
There is no one.
They haven't come to work.

330
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,637
You can't. You really can't.

331
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,800
Who can't?

332
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,720
Tian Zhen,

333
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,760
what's wrong?

334
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,517
Are you two...

335
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,680
We are not!

336
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,680
Peng Shi Yan, you're so annoying!

337
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,637
Since I've known you,

338
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,957
you keep babbling

339
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,320
all sorts of nonsense.

340
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,200
You make up things.

341
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,240
Right?

342
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:47,880
Yes!

343
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,560
So annoying!

344
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,040
So, you two aren't fighting?

345
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,520
Something is wrong.

346
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,600
Since you came back,

347
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,400
the atmosphere between you

348
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,720
has become really different.

349
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,680
What's different?

350
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,480
There is

351
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,720
a subtle,

352
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,120
on-and-off sense of

353
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,720
hostility.

354
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:24,920
Did I get it right?

355
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,680
-Smart.
-I'm good, right?

356
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,720
Very good.

357
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,680
Tou, listen,

358
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,077
don't hold it against
my friend, Tian Zhen, here.

359
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,357
He's not a natural iceberg.

360
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,957
It's just that he comes
from a wealthy family,

361
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,997
-which makes him arrogant and aloof.
-Arrogant and aloof.

362
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,357
You want him to be like you,

363
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,957
-but that's impossible.
-Impossible.

364
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,837
So, just forgive him. Am I right?

365
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,077
Forgive me. Right.

366
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:47,960
Yes.

367
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,120
Peng Shi Yan,

368
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,197
you are so smart.

369
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,317
I know, right?

370
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,400
What's inside that head of yours?

371
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,120
You were born so smart.

372
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,400
-Wisdom.
-How clever.

373
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,837
So smart. Yet how come
a smart guy like you

374
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,080
can't find a girlfriend?

375
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,000
What a pity.

376
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,080
-A pity indeed.
-Such a pity.

377
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,200
Now you're just hurting me.

378
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,160
But

379
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,720
I really can't figure out

380
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,280
what's wrong with me.

381
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,240
You tell me.

382
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,440
I have ideals,

383
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,720
morals,

384
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,717
organization, discipline,
and I'm a cultured young man

385
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,520
of the new era.

386
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,760
Why don't girls like me?

387
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:30,877
Right, Tou?

388
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,720
Why don't girls like me?

389
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,237
Sorry, bro.

390
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,360
I asked the wrong person.

391
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,040
Listen,

392
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,000
last time...

393
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,320
Hang on there.

394
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,080
What do you mean the wrong person?

395
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,517
I... I'm a girl.

396
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,877
You can ask me.

397
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,880
You are a girl.

398
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,080
-Yes.
-But you are also my bro.

399
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,480
So, I walked over.

400
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,720
When I saw the girl,

401
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,280
I told her

402
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,200
every time I...

403
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,680
-Don't you move! I'm going to hit you!
-Someone is mad.

404
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,840
Spare him, spare him.

405
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,606
Spare his life.

406
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,040
Peng Shi Yan,

407
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,340
I have only one word

408
00:20:08,424 --> 00:20:09,357
for you.

409
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,080
-Stupid.
-Sorry?

410
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,477
I don't know about other girls,

411
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,837
but some girls aren't
looking for a boyfriend,

412
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,040
they're looking for a father
for their child.

413
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,000
You're absolutely right.

414
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,280
Yang Xiao Hong said the same thing.

415
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,477
Yes, so use your brain.

416
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,160
She has made it very clear to you.

417
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,557
Figure out a way now.

418
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,520
He who holds the king holds the kingdom.

419
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,957
Once you take care of the child,

420
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,880
won't the mother
be taken care of as well?

421
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,120
The mother?

422
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,400
I like it.

423
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,080
You are so sly.

424
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,437
Don't take it to heart.

425
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,320
Okay.

426
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,400
Drink more warm water.

427
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,080
Your stomach is often upset.

428
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,600
What does he like?

429
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,360
Yang Xiao Hong.

430
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:09,840
He thinks

431
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,440
he can take Yang Xiao Hong?

432
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:14,880
Is it possible?

433
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,160
It's going to be arduous.

434
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,640
Penny for your thoughts.

435
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,480
What's on your mind?

436
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,760
People come into this world,

437
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,800
then depart from it,

438
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,240
yet there's not a trace left behind.

439
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,000
You're thinking about Meng Meng?

440
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,800
Everyone seems like
they're not the least bit sad.

441
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:35,840
Jian Xi,

442
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,840
it's not that we're not sad.

443
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,757
We're all very sad.

444
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,320
And like you,

445
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,120
we really miss Meng Meng too.

446
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,280
You have to understand,

447
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,680
in the adult world,

448
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,400
we can't show our sadness
on our faces every day.

449
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,320
Besides, Master said that

450
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,880
the living are more important.

451
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,440
Ms Xia.

452
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,680
Ms Xia,

453
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,237
after Jian Xi's acupuncture
session today,

454
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,320
she is entering
the herbal medicine stage, right?

455
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,240
Yes.

456
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,600
She will start drinking
the tile medicine tomorrow.

457
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,680
I'm really looking forward to it.

458
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,877
I'm sure it will work.

459
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,360
Yes, it will work.

460
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,720
This herbal medicine
was personally ground,

461
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,197
-brewed, and simmered
-Yes.

462
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,357
by me and Tou Tou.

463
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,317
We have poured
all our blessings into it,

464
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,400
so it will surely work.

465
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,000
Peng, I've thought about it.

466
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,600
Even if it doesn't work,

467
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,280
it won't affect our life.

468
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,440
Right, Jian Xi?

469
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,120
You know,

470
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,760
ever since I started working here,

471
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,320
I feel so at ease.

472
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,960
I feel like we've found
a sense of security.

473
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,200
That's good.

474
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,240
Yes. Come, drink it while it's warm.

475
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,240
Go on.

476
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,520
(Qibo Medical Centre)

477
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,640
Dr Song.

478
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,560
Dr Song.

479
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,556
Dr Song, it's been so long.

480
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,640
Dou Dou,

481
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,520
have you finished
your post-partum recovery?

482
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,237
Yes, last week.

483
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,720
I came here today
to express my gratitude

484
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,357
and bring you
some red-dyed eggs for my baby.

485
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,680
Thank you.

486
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,720
I also have a small request.

487
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,400
You must come to

488
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,120
my baby's 100-day birth party.

489
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,040
He wouldn't have been born without you.

490
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,520
-Congratulations. I'll be there.
-Wonderful.

491
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,357
Hong, please give the eggs to others.

492
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,960
-Okay, I got it.
-Share the happiness with them.

493
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:01,877
Okay.

494
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,840
Congratulations.

495
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,517
Let me take a look at you.

496
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,400
-Okay.
-Red egg.

497
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:10,840
-So many eggs.
-I saw the video you uploaded

498
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,560
on your Moments a few days ago.

499
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,117
Your baby is so cute.

500
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,477
He's a naughty boy.

501
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,357
Yeah?

502
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,280
Here.

503
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,360
Have one too.

504
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,800
Am I okay?

505
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,480
You're recovering well.

506
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,120
Here.

507
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,080
Your pulse is good too.

508
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,040
And

509
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,600
you no longer have symptoms
of Cold Uterus.

510
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,560
Yes.

511
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,560
You had Cold Uterus before?

512
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,357
Isn't it difficult
to conceive with Cold Uterus?

513
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,877
Yes, my lower abdomen
used to feel icy cold,

514
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,240
like an ice pop.

515
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,717
When I tried in vitro fertilization
at that time,

516
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,320
I just couldn't get pregnant.

517
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,957
But then I met Dr Song.

518
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,560
Dr Song helped me
change my lifestyle habits

519
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,117
and taught me to wear warm cotton pants.

520
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,597
After changing those habits,
I naturally became pregnant.

521
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,600
-Really?
-So you see, TCM is not just

522
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,680
about treating diseases,

523
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,120
it's about nurturing and
maintaining health, caring for life.

524
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,200
-You see.
-Right?

525
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,720
By the way, Dr Song,

526
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:09,957
I have a close friend

527
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:10,960
who wants to

528
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,720
have a baby this year.

529
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,560
Learning from my experience,

530
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,597
she wants

531
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,280
to start preparing for conception.

532
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,917
Could you let me know
when you're available?

533
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,440
I'll have her come here to see you.

534
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,877
-Sure.
-Okay.

535
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,200
Thank you so much.

536
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,200
Madam, what do we need to do

537
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,720
for pre-pregnancy preparations?

538
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,957
First, you should ask yourself

539
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,680
why you want to prepare for pregnancy.

540
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,200
Then we can discuss
what needs to be done.

541
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,477
Mr Ren,

542
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:38,080
isn't preparing for pregnancy
a natural thing?

543
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,560
You see,

544
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,877
we often say
"learning life".

545
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,040
What does it mean?

546
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,320
It has two meanings.

547
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,840
The first is

548
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,237
about living a sunny life,

549
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,360
and the second is about
the continuity of life,

550
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,120
passing it on
from generation to generation.

551
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,277
Everyone says that
getting pregnant is the easiest thing.

552
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,800
But that's not true.

553
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,280
Yes.

554
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,200
Come.

555
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,280
Preparing for pregnancy

556
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,637
is not something

557
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,840
you start when you decide

558
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,920
to get pregnant.

559
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,600
It requires

560
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,760
early preparation.

561
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,040
It's like studying for exams
when we were little.

562
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,660
You can't cram at the last minute.

563
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,760
-Right?
-Yes.

564
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,836
Yes.

565
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,077
I remember in the past,

566
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,920
I used to eat ice cream

567
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,317
and drink cold beverages.

568
00:27:27,576 --> 00:27:29,696
I wore clothes
that exposed my legs and back.

569
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:31,997
My Dazhui and Sanyinjiao acupoints

570
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,357
were fully exposed.

571
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,597
So, when I first came
to this medical centre

572
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,797
and saw Dr Song,

573
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,357
I realised it was time
for me to repay my debts.

574
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,680
I needed to clear the coldness I had
accumulated over the past decade or so.

575
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,240
Madam,

576
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,840
please don't blame me for
disagreeing with you.

577
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,120
Our diagnosis needs
to be based on evidence.

578
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,240
We can't see or touch
this Cold Uterus condition.

579
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,080
You just touched someone's pulse

580
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,597
and said she had Cold Uterus.

581
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,080
How can you prove it?

582
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,200
Besides, I've seen
those foreign pregnant women

583
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,920
who still drink a glass of cold water
after giving birth.

584
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,000
And they are fine.

585
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,320
Our class leader here
likes to disagree with us.

586
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,840
Have you ever experienced menstruation?

587
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,920
Then how can you say
Cold Uterus doesn't exist?

588
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,600
A woman's menstrual cycle

589
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,120
is a normal physiological response.

590
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,077
Nowadays, many women experience

591
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,680
pain here and there
during their periods,

592
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,240
which is abnormal.

593
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,197
Tou Tou, copy this.

594
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,117
Next month,

595
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,960
we are planning
to invite some specialists

596
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,520
in gynaecology and paediatrics

597
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:33,480
to hold a pilot
pre-pregnancy preparation camp here.

598
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,920
You can invite your friend
to come and take a look.

599
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,320
If she finds it helpful,
she can sign up.

600
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,717
Thank you.

601
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,600
I will sign up.

602
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,117
Hang on.

603
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,637
You don't even have a boyfriend.
Why do you want to sign up?

604
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,840
Didn't you hear what Madam just said?

605
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,600
I must prepare in advance.

606
00:28:49,995 --> 00:28:51,512
When the channel is formed,
the water will naturally flow.

607
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:53,076
-Right, Madam?
-Yes.

608
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,757
Right, right. Madam,

609
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,397
do men also need
to prepare for pregnancy?

610
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,600
Of course.

611
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,000
Then, I'm signing up too.

612
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,400
Always be prepared, right?

613
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,200
Do I also need
to quit smoking and drinking?

614
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,960
Quitting smoking and drinking
is the basic requirement.

615
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:10,240
If you want to contribute
to your family and society,

616
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,080
it's not something that
can be achieved with just a sperm.

617
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,280
A benevolent person loves others.

618
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,920
If you want to be a benevolent person,

619
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,960
the first lesson is
to learn how to love others.

620
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,600
Mum.

621
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,720
Mum.

622
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,117
Could you get me a blanket?

623
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,200
I feel cold under my legs.

624
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,080
You said you feel cold under your legs?

625
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,800
Professor Ren!

626
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,400
Professor Ren, did you hear that?

627
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,960
Jian Xi said her legs were cold.

628
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,200
She feels something.

629
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,597
You really feel something?

630
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,840
Jian Xi, do you feel your legs?

631
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,277
Your legs are cold.

632
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,520
I feel as if they were being

633
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,360
blown by winds.

634
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,477
Amazing.

635
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,080
The treatment is working
before she even drinks the medicine.

636
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:07,960
Come.

637
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,600
Let me read your pulse.

638
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,560
Your pulse is better than before.

639
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,320
That's a good sign.

640
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,320
Professor Ren,

641
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,000
thank you.

642
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,960
You really didn't lie to me.

643
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,280
You told me to have faith.

644
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,760
I have to have faith.

645
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,720
You are right.

646
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,000
You must have faith.

647
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:00,760
"May there be no more diseases on earth
so that no medicine will be needed"

648
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,680
Master,

649
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,040
Bone Zhu probably
went too far this time.

650
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,237
He only dared to tell you
after he was hospitalized.

651
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,680
He was afraid you would scold him.

652
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,400
Hello, Zhu.

653
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,320
(Professor Ren.)

654
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,480
(Hello.)

655
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,720
I'm Zhu Chang Ming's wife.

656
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,480
Zhu

657
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,560
is dying.

658
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,320
(He'd like you to come see him.)

659
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,920
How did he get himself into this state?

660
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,680
Are you okay?

661
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,480
Professor Ren.

662
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,000
How did you get yourself
into this state?

663
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,120
I really regret it.

664
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,760
I really do.

665
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,080
Professor Ren.

666
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,880
I really regret it.

667
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,440
Help me.

668
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,720
If I can recover,

669
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,200
I'll be a good man.

670
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,120
Don't be afraid.

671
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,600
You need to let go.

672
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,280
There's no need to regret.

673
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,320
But I'm so scared.

674
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,800
Please help me.

675
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,120
I'm dying.

676
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,160
This is a bead.

677
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,440
It was given to me by one of my masters.

678
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,360
I'm giving it to you now.

679
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,320
Keep it with you.

680
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,200
It will illuminate the path

681
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,040
you're about to embark on.

682
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,680
You won't be afraid then.

683
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,760
Professor Ren,

684
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,200
when I'm gone,

685
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:08,040
will you take care of my family?

686
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,600
Don't worry.

687
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,280
It is my responsibility

688
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,240
to take care of people.

689
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,760
Don't be afraid.

690
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,080
Thank you.

691
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,840
Why aren't you saying anything?

692
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,120
I just didn't expect

693
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,320
to encounter death.

694
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,640
I wasn't ready
to say goodbye to him yet.

695
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,920
We not only need to be prepared
to say goodbye to others

696
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:37,640
but also to ourselves.

697
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:41,840
Master,

698
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,120
I'm still young.

699
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,320
Tou Tou,

700
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,720
in life, there are five blessings.

701
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,680
Longevity,

702
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,280
wealth,

703
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:54,920
good health,

704
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,880
cultivating virtues,

705
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,720
and passing the final test.

706
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,840
Is passing the final test
referring to a peaceful death?

707
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:02,840
Yes.

708
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,877
A peaceful death

709
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,280
signifies passing the final test

710
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,200
of life.

711
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,800
Remember, Tou Tou,

712
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,840
you must prepare

713
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:17,400
for the final test throughout your life.

714
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,040
You are young now.

715
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,837
But when you are in middle age,
and in old age,

716
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,520
you must not make any mistakes.

717
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,200
When it's time
to depart from this world,

718
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,040
you will find peace

719
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:31,880
and have no fear.

720
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,560
I understand now.

721
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,640
What do you understand?

722
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,920
I understand why you
brought me there to see Zhu.

723
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,080
Zhu and Meng Meng,

724
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,600
throughout their lives,

725
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,080
they didn't know why they came,

726
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,360
why they would leave,

727
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,800
and even who they were

728
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,760
or where they were heading.

729
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,440
So, you want me
to start contemplating now.

730
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,320
I just want you to focus on the road.

731
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:44,560
(Qibo Medical Centre)

732
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:47,960
Tao Zi,

733
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,360
are you sure this is the place?

734
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,197
Yes, it is.

735
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,960
It matched the address and name
given to us by Dr Ren.

736
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,197
Good.

737
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,597
Are you here for a consultation?

738
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,600
-Do you have an appointment?
-Hi, we're here to see Dr Ren.

739
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,037
Yes, we're here to
see Miracle Doctor, Dr Ren.

740
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,920
Professor Ren arrived quite early today.

741
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:04,997
You came at a right time.

742
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,920
-Come on. I'll take you to him.
-Thank you.

743
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,960
We finally found him.

744
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,520
I'm exhausted.

745
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,840
Professor Ren,

746
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,960
two of your old patients
are here to see you.

747
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,520
Not him, not him.

748
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,440
We only want to see Dr Ren.

749
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,437
That's right. The Miracle Doctor
we are looking for

750
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,240
is younger and more handsome than him.

751
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,600
Yes. Dr Ren is a very good doctor.

752
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,520
Since he's not here, let's go then.

753
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,720
Uncle Niu.

754
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,480
-Tao Zi.
-Dr Ren!

755
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,600
-Dr Ren.
-What brings you here?

756
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,760
We came here today
specifically to thank you.

757
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,117
You see, I also brought you
some local specialties.

758
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,160
You shouldn't have.

759
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,517
I was thinking to ask you
to take a look at me too.

760
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,557
You see, you almost healed me.

761
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,877
No problem, I'll have my father
take a look at you.

762
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,960
No, no.

763
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,357
We want you.

764
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,757
We came here for you.

765
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,437
You don't understand.
My dad is a really good doctor.

766
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,517
I have consulted

767
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,200
several older doctors before,

768
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,880
but I didn't share a connection
with them like I did with you.

769
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,560
You are already here.

770
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,117
And you won't let me take
a look at you. Will you regret it later?

771
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,157
I won't, I won't.

772
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,000
I won't charge you.

773
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,600
No, no. We only trust Dr Ren.

774
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,440
That's right. We only trust Dr Ren.

775
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,200
Miracle Doctor?

776
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,440
Why are you laughing?

777
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,640
Miracle Doctor.

778
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,560
Come, try this dried persimmon.

779
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,640
It's delicious.

780
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:41,720
It's cold.

781
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,800
Cold?

782
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,720
You're disappointed, huh?

783
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,920
This is from the fellow villager who
came to Tian Zhen for consultation.

784
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,280
He brought this from his hometown.

785
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,080
It's a heartfelt gesture, all warmth.

786
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,157
I'll try it then.

787
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,920
Try this one. Here.

788
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,160
Feeling defeated, huh?

789
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,960
Dr Junior Ren is

790
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:16,120
better than Professor Ren.

791
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,640
That means I educated him well.

792
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,840
I'm still better than him.

793
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,520
Will it kill you
to praise your son a little?

794
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,560
I think

795
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,280
our previous teaching methods,

796
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,877
like staying in the medical centre
and seeing patients, are not effective.

797
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,400
Our son should find his own path.

798
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,877
He needs to accumulate
medical affinity.

799
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,120
What is medical affinity?

800
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,600
It means accumulating
merits and virtues.

801
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,960
Through the provision of free
medical service for three to five years,

802
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,160
patients will come to him voluntarily.

803
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,160
I agree.

804
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:55,680
Really.

805
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,080
We should let them go to
the countryside to be barefoot doctors,

806
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,400
right?

807
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,877
When they face various
difficult and complicated cases,

808
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,717
they will find solutions on their own.

809
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,320
This way, they will quickly
become skilled at their work.

810
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,997
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

811
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,480
(are referenced from relevant
traditional Chinese medicine books)

812
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,760
(Do not use without medical advice)
