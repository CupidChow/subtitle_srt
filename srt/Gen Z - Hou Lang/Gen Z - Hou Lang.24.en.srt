(Gen Z)

00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,902
(Episode 24)

3
00:01:57,536 --> 00:01:59,296
Hurry up. School's over.

4
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:00,817
We're only late a bit.

5
00:02:00,817 --> 00:02:02,296
Le Le won't go anywhere.

6
00:02:02,616 --> 00:02:04,456
I brought you here so that
we could steal the child together.

7
00:02:04,456 --> 00:02:05,616
But look at you.

8
00:02:05,616 --> 00:02:06,497
There's no point now.

9
00:02:06,696 --> 00:02:08,776
I'm sure Cheng Ying
has already taken Le Le.

10
00:02:09,256 --> 00:02:10,105
We came here for nothing.

11
00:02:10,256 --> 00:02:11,217
She's a woman.

12
00:02:11,217 --> 00:02:12,736
How could I steal a child from a woman?

13
00:02:13,736 --> 00:02:14,616
Besides,

14
00:02:14,736 --> 00:02:15,896
-it's her child.
-Granny!

15
00:02:15,896 --> 00:02:17,096
Even if you want to steal her child,
you should bring Brother here.

16
00:02:17,096 --> 00:02:18,136
You should tell his father to come.

17
00:02:18,416 --> 00:02:19,497
-Le Le!
-Le Le!

18
00:02:19,857 --> 00:02:21,576
Le Le, my baby grandson!

19
00:02:21,697 --> 00:02:22,857
-Come here, Le Le.
-Granny!

20
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:26,096
Slow down. You'll drop him!

21
00:02:26,256 --> 00:02:27,057
Yeah, yeah.

22
00:02:27,256 --> 00:02:28,177
Ms Zhang.

23
00:02:28,377 --> 00:02:29,896
Le Le's Granny, this weekend,

24
00:02:29,896 --> 00:02:30,896
we need them

25
00:02:30,896 --> 00:02:32,616
to observe lotus leaves and fish

26
00:02:32,616 --> 00:02:33,616
and record them

27
00:02:33,616 --> 00:02:35,136
on their workbook.

28
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,537
We need them to take three photos.

29
00:02:36,537 --> 00:02:38,616
Alright, I'll complete
the task with him.

30
00:02:39,457 --> 00:02:40,777
We need his parents to join him.

31
00:02:40,777 --> 00:02:41,697
Not his grandparents.

32
00:02:41,697 --> 00:02:42,616
We want a family photo.

33
00:02:44,457 --> 00:02:46,296
He needs to take a photo
with his parents?

34
00:02:47,176 --> 00:02:48,256
Can he take it with his stepmother?

35
00:02:48,256 --> 00:02:49,496
Sure.

36
00:02:49,496 --> 00:02:50,377
Le Le's mother called me

37
00:02:50,377 --> 00:02:51,697
and instructed me

38
00:02:51,697 --> 00:02:52,936
to tell you about this.

39
00:02:53,377 --> 00:02:54,417
She called you?

40
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:56,051
Isn't she here today?

41
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,576
She said you were coming today.

42
00:02:57,576 --> 00:02:58,457
If you didn't,

43
00:02:58,457 --> 00:02:59,457
I would call her.

44
00:03:00,296 --> 00:03:02,017
Of course I'd be here.

45
00:03:02,496 --> 00:03:03,737
Goodbye, Ms Zhang.

46
00:03:03,777 --> 00:03:04,896
Okay. Take care.

47
00:03:08,296 --> 00:03:09,144
Granny is here.

48
00:03:09,377 --> 00:03:10,616
Baby grandson.

49
00:03:10,616 --> 00:03:11,896
Look at what I bought for you. Take it.

50
00:03:12,496 --> 00:03:14,057
Didn't your mother come to pick you up?

51
00:03:15,417 --> 00:03:17,176
Mum said I'm going

52
00:03:17,176 --> 00:03:18,417
to Dad's house this weekend.

53
00:03:18,417 --> 00:03:19,616
She said you would pick me up.

54
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:20,856
Didn't she say anything?

55
00:03:20,856 --> 00:03:21,816
Didn't she badmouth

56
00:03:21,816 --> 00:03:22,896
your father or me?

57
00:03:22,896 --> 00:03:23,816
-Mum!
-She didn't.

58
00:03:23,816 --> 00:03:24,977
You're so narrow-minded.

59
00:03:25,457 --> 00:03:26,896
You're badmouthing Sister-in-law

60
00:03:26,896 --> 00:03:28,017
and stealing her child.

61
00:03:28,017 --> 00:03:28,856
I told you already.

62
00:03:28,856 --> 00:03:30,657
My sister-in-law isn't
that kind of person.

63
00:03:30,657 --> 00:03:31,856
You still brought me here
to do your evil deed.

64
00:03:31,856 --> 00:03:32,699
Look at what you've done.

65
00:03:32,737 --> 00:03:34,097
I came here for nothing.

66
00:03:34,856 --> 00:03:35,697
Listen.

67
00:03:35,697 --> 00:03:36,936
She's just afraid of me.

68
00:03:36,936 --> 00:03:38,216
I have evidence.

69
00:03:39,296 --> 00:03:40,230
Listen.

70
00:03:40,256 --> 00:03:41,856
I'm sure she's afraid of me.

71
00:03:42,496 --> 00:03:43,816
I have evidence.

72
00:03:44,096 --> 00:03:46,096
She's afraid that the court

73
00:03:46,096 --> 00:03:46,937
might give me custody of Le Le

74
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:47,896
when we fight for him.

75
00:03:47,896 --> 00:03:48,785
Yeah, yeah.

76
00:03:49,256 --> 00:03:51,016
Le Le, can you prove it?

77
00:03:51,016 --> 00:03:52,137
Your mother hit me

78
00:03:52,137 --> 00:03:53,256
last week, right?

79
00:03:54,176 --> 00:03:56,217
You pushed Mum first.

80
00:03:57,536 --> 00:03:58,977
Heartless boy.

81
00:03:59,256 --> 00:04:00,736
I did it for your sake.

82
00:04:01,256 --> 00:04:03,256
Do you know who loves you the most?

83
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,256
Listen.

84
00:04:04,256 --> 00:04:06,256
I'm the one who loves you the most.

85
00:04:06,256 --> 00:04:07,536
I was waiting for you

86
00:04:07,536 --> 00:04:09,297
in front of the delivery room

87
00:04:09,736 --> 00:04:11,096
before you were born.

88
00:04:11,337 --> 00:04:13,016
Le Le, don't listen to Granny.

89
00:04:13,456 --> 00:04:14,896
Granny is driving a wedge
between you and your mother.

90
00:04:14,896 --> 00:04:17,057
Your mother loves you the most.

91
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:17,952
Understood?

92
00:04:17,977 --> 00:04:19,736
Your grandmother is no match
for your mother.

93
00:04:22,256 --> 00:04:23,417
You're so heartless.

94
00:04:23,456 --> 00:04:24,456
I was just stating facts.

95
00:04:24,456 --> 00:04:25,376
Why are you hitting me?

96
00:04:25,376 --> 00:04:26,337
Will you be happy

97
00:04:26,337 --> 00:04:27,616
if I say Grandma loves me

98
00:04:27,616 --> 00:04:28,456
the most

99
00:04:28,616 --> 00:04:29,456
instead of you?

100
00:04:29,616 --> 00:04:32,057
Mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law
are born rivals.

101
00:04:32,057 --> 00:04:34,137
Even so, you got yourself
two daughters-in-law.

102
00:04:35,616 --> 00:04:36,456
It's hard to say.

103
00:04:36,456 --> 00:04:37,697
Maybe you'll get a third one
in the future.

104
00:04:38,016 --> 00:04:39,176
She'll be my wife.

105
00:04:40,096 --> 00:04:41,016
This kid.

106
00:04:41,456 --> 00:04:42,697
He has a girlfriend now?

107
00:04:44,096 --> 00:04:45,816
When will you bring

108
00:04:45,816 --> 00:04:47,456
your girlfriend back?

109
00:04:47,896 --> 00:04:48,816
This kid is something else.

110
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,840
(Qibo Medical Centre)

111
00:04:59,536 --> 00:05:00,376
What are you doing?

112
00:05:02,536 --> 00:05:03,536
-Calm down.
-Tian Zhen!

113
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:05,016
-What's wrong?
-This is huge.

114
00:05:05,176 --> 00:05:06,217
-We're in trouble.
-What is it?

115
00:05:06,256 --> 00:05:07,376
Bai Mo Li has a fever, right?

116
00:05:08,096 --> 00:05:08,996
How did you know?

117
00:05:09,736 --> 00:05:11,137
Don't ask me why. I just know it.

118
00:05:11,176 --> 00:05:12,896
Tou Tou, pack your stuff and follow me.

119
00:05:14,376 --> 00:05:15,230
Let's go.

120
00:05:15,297 --> 00:05:16,129
Wait.

121
00:05:18,256 --> 00:05:19,129
Tou Tou.

122
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:19,977
-Mr Ren.
-Coming!

123
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,879
She called you?

124
00:05:21,096 --> 00:05:22,057
No.

125
00:05:22,376 --> 00:05:23,504
Let's go.

126
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:48,977
Why did you only tell us by now?

127
00:05:48,977 --> 00:05:50,256
It's already the third day.

128
00:05:50,816 --> 00:05:52,336
My grandmother didn't tell me
she had a fever

129
00:05:52,336 --> 00:05:53,216
on the first day.

130
00:05:53,536 --> 00:05:55,376
On the second day, Dr Peng
gave her some medicine.

131
00:05:55,376 --> 00:05:56,656
Her condition didn't
turn for the better after one day.

132
00:05:57,496 --> 00:05:58,897
How long has she been taking

133
00:05:58,897 --> 00:05:59,776
the new prescription?

134
00:06:00,056 --> 00:06:01,536
She has one more dose left.

135
00:06:01,776 --> 00:06:03,936
I've tried all kinds of methods to lower
her body temperature but to no avail.

136
00:06:04,177 --> 00:06:05,336
Considering her age,

137
00:06:05,336 --> 00:06:06,816
I was planning to send her
to the hospital.

138
00:06:06,936 --> 00:06:08,697
But Mr Ren, she insisted on
bringing you here.

139
00:06:09,776 --> 00:06:10,617
That was within my expectation.

140
00:06:11,656 --> 00:06:12,816
Did you expect her to vomit blood

141
00:06:12,816 --> 00:06:13,697
and have a high fever?

142
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:15,936
Do you really think you're a deity?

143
00:06:17,496 --> 00:06:18,336
Dr Peng,

144
00:06:19,376 --> 00:06:20,496
both of us are doctors.

145
00:06:20,776 --> 00:06:21,816
You focus on Western medicine

146
00:06:21,816 --> 00:06:23,017
while I focus on Chinese medicine.

147
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:25,617
Actually, the field of Western medicine
and Chinese medicine

148
00:06:25,936 --> 00:06:27,897
have different explanations
for illnesses.

149
00:06:28,536 --> 00:06:30,697
Western doctors like to use

150
00:06:31,017 --> 00:06:32,936
strong words like

151
00:06:33,096 --> 00:06:34,897
sedatives and disinfectant

152
00:06:35,256 --> 00:06:36,376
to treat illnesses.

153
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:37,457
Actually, illnesses

154
00:06:38,897 --> 00:06:39,776
aren't bad things.

155
00:06:40,536 --> 00:06:41,496
They're just there

156
00:06:41,496 --> 00:06:42,617
to remind our bodies.

157
00:06:43,177 --> 00:06:44,376
She's having a fever now.

158
00:06:45,056 --> 00:06:46,457
Actually, it's the conflict

159
00:06:46,457 --> 00:06:48,056
between good and bad in her body.

160
00:06:48,776 --> 00:06:49,816
To put it bluntly,

161
00:06:49,816 --> 00:06:51,376
it's your immunity

162
00:06:51,776 --> 00:06:53,376
trying to fight off the invaders.

163
00:06:55,816 --> 00:06:57,177
At her age,

164
00:06:57,177 --> 00:06:58,656
it's hard to develop a fever.

165
00:06:59,897 --> 00:07:01,256
Try and develop a fever.

166
00:07:01,936 --> 00:07:03,056
I think it's been a decade

167
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:05,017
since you last had a fever.

168
00:07:05,737 --> 00:07:07,177
Yeah, I have a healthy body.

169
00:07:07,457 --> 00:07:08,254
Not necessarily.

170
00:07:09,737 --> 00:07:10,656
There's another type of possibility.

171
00:07:10,816 --> 00:07:11,656
It's sub-health.

172
00:07:11,816 --> 00:07:12,776
Actually, his body

173
00:07:12,776 --> 00:07:14,577
has already surrendered.

174
00:07:17,536 --> 00:07:18,697
If this keeps up,

175
00:07:19,017 --> 00:07:20,617
other complications will occur.

176
00:07:21,017 --> 00:07:22,737
You should stop bragging about
your capabilities.

177
00:07:24,776 --> 00:07:25,656
Peng Shi Yan,

178
00:07:25,897 --> 00:07:26,936
mind your words.

179
00:07:27,256 --> 00:07:28,496
I've tolerated you for a long time.

180
00:07:29,096 --> 00:07:30,776
I know there's a difference
between our fields.

181
00:07:31,056 --> 00:07:32,857
But we should still
respect our teachers.

182
00:07:32,857 --> 00:07:34,336
I do respect my teachers.

183
00:07:34,536 --> 00:07:35,417
However, there's no difference
between students and teachers

184
00:07:35,417 --> 00:07:36,776
when it comes to prudence
towards illnesses.

185
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,340
Am I right, Mr Ren?

186
00:07:39,336 --> 00:07:40,256
You're right.

187
00:07:41,056 --> 00:07:41,897
Madam Bai.

188
00:07:43,617 --> 00:07:45,496
Why don't I give you
an acupuncture treatment?

189
00:07:46,017 --> 00:07:46,936
Once it's over,

190
00:07:46,936 --> 00:07:48,737
your fever should subside

191
00:07:48,816 --> 00:07:50,216
after 45 minutes.

192
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:52,536
Dr Peng made her fever subside.

193
00:07:52,536 --> 00:07:54,697
But it came back quickly.

194
00:07:55,457 --> 00:07:56,348
Even if he can't do it,

195
00:07:56,617 --> 00:07:57,656
that doesn't mean I can't do it.

196
00:08:00,177 --> 00:08:01,096
How many needles will you use then?

197
00:08:03,056 --> 00:08:03,894
One.

198
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:04,832
Only one?

199
00:08:04,936 --> 00:08:06,457
Yes, only one.

200
00:08:07,496 --> 00:08:08,336
And, it doesn't hurt too.

201
00:08:10,536 --> 00:08:11,433
Tou Tou,

202
00:08:11,617 --> 00:08:13,656
make some porridge for her.

203
00:08:13,936 --> 00:08:15,577
She might be hungry after waking up.

204
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,783
Okay.

205
00:08:23,897 --> 00:08:24,840
Madam Bai,

206
00:08:24,936 --> 00:08:25,816
tell me

207
00:08:25,816 --> 00:08:26,697
if you feel uncomfortable.

208
00:08:26,697 --> 00:08:27,656
I'll send you to the hospital.

209
00:08:30,336 --> 00:08:31,336
I'm not going to the hospital.

210
00:08:32,336 --> 00:08:33,897
I want him to treat me.

211
00:08:35,737 --> 00:08:36,816
None of us can bear the responsibility

212
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:38,297
if something does happen to you.

213
00:08:39,536 --> 00:08:40,457
Dr Peng,

214
00:08:41,056 --> 00:08:41,965
you know

215
00:08:42,376 --> 00:08:43,617
that I'm a faithful person.

216
00:08:45,216 --> 00:08:47,776
If God is trying to summon me to Heaven,

217
00:08:49,936 --> 00:08:51,177
I will gladly accept it.

218
00:08:53,737 --> 00:08:54,737
Madam Bai,

219
00:08:55,376 --> 00:08:56,617
I will protect

220
00:08:56,897 --> 00:08:58,017
your life.

221
00:08:58,496 --> 00:08:59,776
It won't be easy for you to go

222
00:09:00,216 --> 00:09:01,816
when I'm here with you.

223
00:09:02,816 --> 00:09:03,897
After the treatment,

224
00:09:04,457 --> 00:09:05,776
just close your eyes and rest.

225
00:09:06,457 --> 00:09:07,285
It won't hurt at all.

226
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:46,254
You're making porridge?

227
00:09:46,897 --> 00:09:48,056
So, foreigners have rice
in the house too?

228
00:09:48,216 --> 00:09:49,216
They don't.

229
00:09:49,936 --> 00:09:50,857
Now, even if your father

230
00:09:51,656 --> 00:09:53,496
doesn't tell me anything,

231
00:09:53,496 --> 00:09:54,816
I know what to take.

232
00:09:55,216 --> 00:09:56,336
I brought it from

233
00:09:56,737 --> 00:09:57,536
the medical centre.

234
00:09:57,737 --> 00:09:59,336
Not bad at all, bootlicker.

235
00:09:59,336 --> 00:10:00,191
Tell me the theory behind it then.

236
00:10:01,096 --> 00:10:02,977
According to the 12th rule of
Treatise On Febrile Caused by Cold,

237
00:10:03,096 --> 00:10:04,617
hot porridge should be consumed

238
00:10:04,897 --> 00:10:06,496
together with Cinnamon Twig Decoction

239
00:10:06,656 --> 00:10:07,536
to boost its effectiveness.

240
00:10:07,896 --> 00:10:09,177
I'm making hot porridge.

241
00:10:09,456 --> 00:10:10,417
That's why

242
00:10:10,656 --> 00:10:12,377
I brought the Cinnamon Twig Decoction.

243
00:10:13,656 --> 00:10:14,656
But your father...

244
00:10:21,016 --> 00:10:23,096
Your father didn't say that
he needed it.

245
00:10:24,096 --> 00:10:25,896
I brought it here for nothing.

246
00:10:26,096 --> 00:10:27,536
Even now, I still don't understand

247
00:10:27,536 --> 00:10:28,896
if your father wishes
to proceed with acupuncture treatment

248
00:10:28,896 --> 00:10:29,896
or give her a prescription.

249
00:10:30,016 --> 00:10:31,016
Do you have water?

250
00:10:31,336 --> 00:10:32,215
I'm thirsty.

251
00:10:32,456 --> 00:10:33,857
Yeah. What about some health tea?

252
00:10:34,776 --> 00:10:35,668
That'll do.

253
00:10:35,857 --> 00:10:36,793
It's inside the bag.

254
00:10:45,456 --> 00:10:47,096
How many things have you brought here?

255
00:10:47,456 --> 00:10:48,379
At the bottom.

256
00:11:04,776 --> 00:11:06,136
You're finally doing decent work now.

257
00:11:10,776 --> 00:11:12,216
Remember to insert money
into the money box.

258
00:11:13,136 --> 00:11:15,057
You're trying to record your own merit?

259
00:11:15,057 --> 00:11:17,417
We should do kind deeds
without expecting anything in return.

260
00:11:17,417 --> 00:11:18,857
We shouldn't bring it up.

261
00:11:19,456 --> 00:11:20,776
It's not like I'm bringing it up
on purpose.

262
00:11:20,776 --> 00:11:21,896
You'll definitely forget

263
00:11:21,896 --> 00:11:23,096
if I don't bring it up.

264
00:11:23,536 --> 00:11:24,434
Can you remember it?

265
00:11:24,896 --> 00:11:25,977
Maybe not.

266
00:11:30,336 --> 00:11:31,238
Tou Tou.

267
00:11:46,896 --> 00:11:47,896
Send it to your dad.

268
00:12:30,576 --> 00:12:31,488
Her fever has subsided.

269
00:12:35,136 --> 00:12:36,082
I'm a little hungry.

270
00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:38,016
-You're hungry?
-Here.

271
00:12:40,336 --> 00:12:41,696
Feed it to her while it's hot.
Feed her slowly.

272
00:12:51,656 --> 00:12:53,016
Has she recovered then?

273
00:12:55,016 --> 00:12:57,016
You can take some
Chinese medicine first.

274
00:12:57,216 --> 00:12:58,776
After that, you can head to the hospital

275
00:12:58,896 --> 00:13:00,536
to get a body check-up.

276
00:13:00,896 --> 00:13:02,016
This way, you two

277
00:13:02,456 --> 00:13:03,417
can rest at ease.

278
00:13:03,656 --> 00:13:04,536
I trust you.

279
00:13:04,896 --> 00:13:05,776
I feel relieved

280
00:13:06,216 --> 00:13:07,297
since you said that I'm fine now.

281
00:13:07,857 --> 00:13:09,336
Thank you for trusting me.

282
00:13:09,336 --> 00:13:10,216
Eat up.

283
00:13:11,896 --> 00:13:12,777
Do you admit defeat?

284
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:14,332
Do you?

285
00:13:14,456 --> 00:13:16,136
-Eat up.
-Do you admit defeat?

286
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:17,832
I don't.

287
00:13:18,336 --> 00:13:19,536
I won't admit defeat.

288
00:13:19,696 --> 00:13:20,817
Listen. We Western doctors

289
00:13:20,817 --> 00:13:22,417
have standard procedures to follow
when it comes to giving diagnoses

290
00:13:22,417 --> 00:13:23,656
and prescribing medication.

291
00:13:23,857 --> 00:13:25,857
Mr Ren, you just came here
and insert a needle into her arm.

292
00:13:25,896 --> 00:13:26,977
How could we learn that?

293
00:13:26,977 --> 00:13:27,776
What are you saying?

294
00:13:27,776 --> 00:13:28,576
You're so noisy.

295
00:13:28,576 --> 00:13:29,737
You can't stop talking, huh?

296
00:13:29,857 --> 00:13:30,776
Let's teach him a lesson.

297
00:13:31,417 --> 00:13:32,216
You should've...

298
00:13:32,576 --> 00:13:33,410
You three, leave.

299
00:13:34,016 --> 00:13:35,377
Let Madam Bai rest.

300
00:13:36,696 --> 00:13:37,536
This is unreasonable.

301
00:13:37,857 --> 00:13:38,896
You're unreasonable.

302
00:13:38,896 --> 00:13:39,855
Leave now.

303
00:13:40,536 --> 00:13:41,336
Dr Peng,

304
00:13:41,336 --> 00:13:43,617
you said it was unreasonable.

305
00:13:44,536 --> 00:13:45,441
That's not the case.

306
00:13:46,977 --> 00:13:48,297
In Chinese medicine,

307
00:13:48,297 --> 00:13:51,400
among Principles, Methods,
Formulas and Medicinals,

308
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:53,120
Principles is
the most important element.

309
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:54,336
Just now,

310
00:13:54,536 --> 00:13:55,776
I was doing acupuncture.

311
00:13:56,096 --> 00:13:57,096
We can call it

312
00:13:57,456 --> 00:13:59,656
Principles, Methods,
Formulas and Needles.

313
00:13:59,977 --> 00:14:01,216
Every needle I used

314
00:14:01,336 --> 00:14:02,297
was based on Principles.

315
00:14:04,096 --> 00:14:05,417
He still has no idea. Tou Tou.

316
00:14:06,336 --> 00:14:07,269
Tell him.

317
00:14:11,297 --> 00:14:13,016
I don't know either.

318
00:14:14,656 --> 00:14:15,937
I haven't learned this yet.

319
00:14:15,937 --> 00:14:16,977
How would I know?

320
00:14:16,977 --> 00:14:19,160
You still don't know even after
learning under me for a long time?

321
00:14:23,776 --> 00:14:25,776
Recite Rule 58 of
Treatise On Febrile Caused by Cold.

322
00:14:28,297 --> 00:14:30,096
Rule 58 of
Treatise On Febrile Caused by Cold.

323
00:14:31,456 --> 00:14:34,257
Illnesses with symptoms
like sweating, vomiting,

324
00:14:34,257 --> 00:14:36,377
diarrhoea, bleeding,
and exhausting of body fluid,

325
00:14:36,377 --> 00:14:38,960
achieving self-balance of Yin and Yang
will ensure recovery.

326
00:14:39,136 --> 00:14:40,776
What did she mean

327
00:14:40,776 --> 00:14:41,737
by that?

328
00:14:41,776 --> 00:14:43,216
It means

329
00:14:43,456 --> 00:14:45,536
that no matter how sick you are,

330
00:14:45,536 --> 00:14:46,896
as long as you achieve self-balance,

331
00:14:47,456 --> 00:14:48,336
you'll recover.

332
00:14:48,776 --> 00:14:49,576
Self-balance?

333
00:14:52,656 --> 00:14:56,696
Neiguan belongs to the Jueyin Meridian.

334
00:14:56,696 --> 00:14:58,177
Among the Six Meridians,

335
00:14:58,177 --> 00:14:59,336
Jueyin Meridian

336
00:14:59,776 --> 00:15:02,096
represents the end of Yin
and the birth of Yang.

337
00:15:02,536 --> 00:15:04,096
Madam Bai

338
00:15:04,096 --> 00:15:05,456
has been sick for quite some time.

339
00:15:05,857 --> 00:15:06,776
In the end,

340
00:15:06,776 --> 00:15:09,497
we still need to depend on
the Jueyin Meridian to cure her.

341
00:15:10,016 --> 00:15:11,216
She's old.

342
00:15:11,417 --> 00:15:12,576
She already lacked Yang energy.

343
00:15:12,977 --> 00:15:14,656
If you apply pressure
on the Neiguan point,

344
00:15:14,656 --> 00:15:15,497
once the Yang energy rises,

345
00:15:16,136 --> 00:15:17,257
self-balance will be achieved.

346
00:15:17,977 --> 00:15:19,336
The illness will be cured by then.

347
00:15:20,456 --> 00:15:22,977
You see, in Chinese medicine,

348
00:15:22,977 --> 00:15:25,656
we don't fight illnesses.

349
00:15:26,417 --> 00:15:28,776
We strive to achieve balance.

350
00:15:29,896 --> 00:15:31,016
We don't expect people

351
00:15:31,216 --> 00:15:32,977
to be 100% healthy.

352
00:15:33,456 --> 00:15:34,977
No such people exist too.

353
00:15:35,456 --> 00:15:36,656
We just expect our body

354
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:39,297
to be 51% healthy.

355
00:15:39,297 --> 00:15:41,536
It's fine as long as health
is the major shareholder.

356
00:15:42,297 --> 00:15:43,857
Both strengths and weaknesses

357
00:15:44,096 --> 00:15:46,096
have their own balance to maintain.

358
00:15:47,136 --> 00:15:48,051
Got it?

359
00:15:50,216 --> 00:15:51,035
Understood?

360
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:53,977
Master, I think

361
00:15:54,216 --> 00:15:55,656
I can only make
Cinnamon Twig Decoction now.

362
00:15:56,096 --> 00:15:57,016
I still have no way

363
00:15:57,016 --> 00:15:58,297
to understand such deep theories.

364
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:01,216
Acupuncture and brewing medicine

365
00:16:01,456 --> 00:16:02,977
are still too tough for me.

366
00:16:03,216 --> 00:16:05,096
I can't just use whatever I like.

367
00:16:05,857 --> 00:16:08,456
I'm just skilful at certain things.

368
00:16:09,336 --> 00:16:10,336
When it comes to acupuncture
and brewing medicine,

369
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:11,696
I have complete confidence in them.

370
00:16:11,696 --> 00:16:12,576
However, when it comes to techniques,

371
00:16:13,896 --> 00:16:15,216
I'm inferior to Ms Dong.

372
00:16:16,096 --> 00:16:16,977
Of course.

373
00:16:17,336 --> 00:16:18,417
But to you...

374
00:16:18,656 --> 00:16:19,504
Dr Ren.

375
00:16:19,696 --> 00:16:20,656
I don't know

376
00:16:20,857 --> 00:16:22,336
how I can express my gratitude.

377
00:16:22,336 --> 00:16:23,656
Don't mention it.

378
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:25,297
I just did

379
00:16:25,456 --> 00:16:27,617
what a doctor should do.

380
00:16:28,656 --> 00:16:30,096
To you, it may be your duty.

381
00:16:30,576 --> 00:16:31,431
But to me,

382
00:16:31,456 --> 00:16:32,696
to my family,

383
00:16:33,216 --> 00:16:34,257
you've resolved

384
00:16:34,257 --> 00:16:35,456
a troublesome issue for us.

385
00:16:45,536 --> 00:16:46,776
Donation for education?

386
00:16:47,896 --> 00:16:49,096
This is too much money.

387
00:16:49,096 --> 00:16:50,096
I cannot accept this.

388
00:16:51,656 --> 00:16:53,216
Dr Ren, I heard

389
00:16:53,696 --> 00:16:56,776
that the class you are holding

390
00:16:56,776 --> 00:16:57,696
is facing financial issues.

391
00:16:57,977 --> 00:16:58,896
Your capabilities

392
00:16:59,016 --> 00:17:00,896
aren't used to earn money.

393
00:17:01,336 --> 00:17:02,696
They are used to cure people.

394
00:17:03,336 --> 00:17:04,336
Now,

395
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:06,656
I will show you my capabilities.

396
00:17:06,656 --> 00:17:08,016
Thank you so much.

397
00:17:08,536 --> 00:17:10,576
I understand your feelings.

398
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,016
I understand why you're
donating to our cause.

399
00:17:13,016 --> 00:17:14,977
However, I won't be able
to live in peace

400
00:17:15,776 --> 00:17:16,896
if your family's finance
is affected because of this.

401
00:17:16,896 --> 00:17:18,057
That's why

402
00:17:18,057 --> 00:17:19,216
I cannot accept this.

403
00:17:20,216 --> 00:17:21,199
Dr Ren,

404
00:17:21,336 --> 00:17:23,096
our finance will be fine.

405
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:25,216
I thought Madam Bai was a teacher?

406
00:17:25,216 --> 00:17:26,776
Do foreign teachers get a high salary?

407
00:17:26,776 --> 00:17:27,696
You see,

408
00:17:28,336 --> 00:17:30,016
we're from the Lauder family.

409
00:17:30,896 --> 00:17:31,754
Louder?

410
00:17:32,577 --> 00:17:33,457
Lauder.

411
00:17:33,576 --> 00:17:34,574
What?

412
00:17:35,016 --> 00:17:35,965
Lauder.

413
00:17:36,016 --> 00:17:36,894
What does that mean?

414
00:17:42,536 --> 00:17:43,418
It's fine.

415
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,136
That doesn't matter.

416
00:17:45,696 --> 00:17:46,613
Anyway,

417
00:17:47,417 --> 00:17:48,297
I'm very wealthy.

418
00:17:49,417 --> 00:17:50,656
I'm much wealthier than usual teachers.

419
00:17:51,776 --> 00:17:52,754
You can take the money.

420
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,358
(Qibo Medical Centre)

421
00:18:03,297 --> 00:18:04,456
-Tian Zhen!
-Madam.

422
00:18:05,016 --> 00:18:05,832
Mum.

423
00:18:06,216 --> 00:18:08,136
Come with me to the house

424
00:18:08,136 --> 00:18:09,216
on Anfu Street.

425
00:18:09,776 --> 00:18:11,497
Your grandfather called just now.

426
00:18:11,497 --> 00:18:13,016
There's a potential buyer

427
00:18:13,016 --> 00:18:14,576
who took a liking to our house.

428
00:18:14,576 --> 00:18:16,096
He wants us to sign the contract

429
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:17,817
with the real estate agency.

430
00:18:19,096 --> 00:18:20,377
What are you smiling at?

431
00:18:20,377 --> 00:18:21,656
We're selling our house, you know?

432
00:18:21,906 --> 00:18:22,816
I'm not smiling.

433
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:25,096
After signing the contract,

434
00:18:25,656 --> 00:18:26,776
we have

435
00:18:26,776 --> 00:18:28,216
to clean up the house.

436
00:18:28,216 --> 00:18:29,336
We'll discard unwanted things.

437
00:18:29,336 --> 00:18:30,896
As for the rest, we can move them

438
00:18:30,896 --> 00:18:31,977
to your grandparents' house.

439
00:18:33,016 --> 00:18:34,004
Don't tire yourself out.

440
00:18:35,336 --> 00:18:36,336
Just call a waste collector

441
00:18:36,336 --> 00:18:37,576
to collect everything.

442
00:18:38,776 --> 00:18:39,696
Collect everything?

443
00:18:39,696 --> 00:18:40,816
That won't do.

444
00:18:41,096 --> 00:18:42,777
Although they don't worth much,

445
00:18:43,056 --> 00:18:45,216
many of them contain memories

446
00:18:45,216 --> 00:18:47,296
of me and my son, am I right?

447
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,271
Of course,

448
00:18:48,296 --> 00:18:49,537
it has nothing to do with you.

449
00:18:49,576 --> 00:18:50,696
Yeah, yeah.

450
00:18:51,456 --> 00:18:52,296
You can keep them then.

451
00:18:53,576 --> 00:18:54,456
Keep them?

452
00:18:55,296 --> 00:18:56,617
How can we sell the house

453
00:18:57,216 --> 00:18:58,176
if we keep those things?

454
00:18:59,696 --> 00:19:00,576
We're not selling the house.

455
00:19:03,216 --> 00:19:04,737
We're not selling it?

456
00:19:05,537 --> 00:19:06,897
How can we sustain
the apprentice class then?

457
00:19:09,096 --> 00:19:10,377
I'm rich now.

458
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:21,857
You're rich?

459
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:25,257
Show it to me then.

460
00:19:26,537 --> 00:19:27,441
Give me the money.

461
00:19:29,296 --> 00:19:30,215
Give me the money.

462
00:19:30,816 --> 00:19:31,762
Wait, I...

463
00:19:40,576 --> 00:19:41,696
Keep on pretending, won't you?

464
00:19:47,923 --> 00:19:48,785
Wait,

465
00:19:48,897 --> 00:19:50,416
you weren't joking?

466
00:19:53,537 --> 00:19:54,402
But...

467
00:19:54,696 --> 00:19:56,416
Where did you get the money?

468
00:19:56,576 --> 00:19:58,737
I told you already. I'll get it

469
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:00,416
when I want to.

470
00:20:01,296 --> 00:20:02,223
He got it.

471
00:20:05,216 --> 00:20:06,137
If so,

472
00:20:06,216 --> 00:20:08,017
why didn't you get it earlier?

473
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:09,801
We were worried

474
00:20:09,936 --> 00:20:11,696
for such a long time.

475
00:20:12,017 --> 00:20:13,696
God gave us a chance

476
00:20:13,936 --> 00:20:15,416
to show us

477
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:17,456
how petty you are.

478
00:20:19,576 --> 00:20:20,696
I'm petty?

479
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:24,816
-Sorry, Mum.
-You knew long ago?

480
00:20:24,816 --> 00:20:25,696
See you!

481
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:30,377
Like father, like son.

482
00:20:33,696 --> 00:20:35,056
Tou Tou, give me that check!

483
00:20:55,696 --> 00:20:56,519
Hong.

484
00:20:57,576 --> 00:20:58,465
Rebecca.

485
00:20:59,353 --> 00:21:00,246
I'm sorry.

486
00:21:00,336 --> 00:21:01,576
I was irresponsible with what I said.

487
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:04,176
I know you're a magnanimous person.

488
00:21:04,657 --> 00:21:05,936
Don't hold it against me.

489
00:21:06,296 --> 00:21:07,223
Look.

490
00:21:07,696 --> 00:21:08,657
I even prepared

491
00:21:08,696 --> 00:21:09,696
your favourite

492
00:21:10,096 --> 00:21:11,096
sugar-free yogurt for you.

493
00:21:11,096 --> 00:21:11,977
Treat it as my apology.

494
00:21:12,296 --> 00:21:13,262
Please forgive me.

495
00:21:15,216 --> 00:21:16,056
Did you even say anything

496
00:21:16,056 --> 00:21:17,497
that was worth being angry over?

497
00:21:17,936 --> 00:21:19,257
-Mr Ren.
-Hong.

498
00:21:19,257 --> 00:21:20,096
I have good news.

499
00:21:20,576 --> 00:21:21,576
I found a place.

500
00:21:21,576 --> 00:21:23,137
They can rent it to us for our class.

501
00:21:23,296 --> 00:21:24,456
Do you want to check it out?

502
00:21:24,897 --> 00:21:26,657
What? Are you also trying
to hold a candle to the devil?

503
00:21:26,816 --> 00:21:27,629
Where is it?

504
00:21:29,296 --> 00:21:30,191
No.

505
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:31,416
If you say no, that means no.

506
00:21:32,696 --> 00:21:33,696
You just

507
00:21:35,056 --> 00:21:36,576
maligned me for holding a candle
to the devil

508
00:21:36,816 --> 00:21:38,696
without finding out what was going on

509
00:21:38,696 --> 00:21:40,296
and said that I was
the accomplice to his murder.

510
00:21:40,777 --> 00:21:42,657
That's not it.
I was flustered back then.

511
00:21:42,657 --> 00:21:43,696
I couldn't think straight.

512
00:21:43,936 --> 00:21:44,848
And,

513
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:46,977
you only pay full attention

514
00:21:46,977 --> 00:21:47,936
to your

515
00:21:47,936 --> 00:21:49,137
godson.

516
00:21:53,696 --> 00:21:54,816
Did you see those people?

517
00:21:56,576 --> 00:21:57,696
People who come here

518
00:21:58,296 --> 00:21:59,377
have their own issues

519
00:21:59,377 --> 00:22:00,816
more or less.

520
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:02,537
However, they always get cured

521
00:22:02,576 --> 00:22:03,527
when they come here.

522
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:08,176
Although I'm doing nothing much,

523
00:22:08,176 --> 00:22:09,096
I can make people

524
00:22:09,096 --> 00:22:10,936
feel happy.

525
00:22:12,816 --> 00:22:13,777
Sometimes,

526
00:22:13,777 --> 00:22:14,684
happiness

527
00:22:15,056 --> 00:22:16,737
isn't about how much you get.

528
00:22:17,017 --> 00:22:18,777
It's about how much you give.

529
00:22:26,056 --> 00:22:27,216
What are you still doing here?

530
00:22:27,216 --> 00:22:28,576
Have you lost your job? Don't you
need to return to the hospital?

531
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:31,456
Oh yeah, I forgot to apply for leave.

532
00:22:32,296 --> 00:22:34,176
So, you're not angry at me anymore?

533
00:22:35,657 --> 00:22:36,696
For our new apprentice class,

534
00:22:36,936 --> 00:22:37,857
we need labour

535
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:39,336
to clean up our new place.

536
00:22:39,456 --> 00:22:40,857
I'll send you the schedule.

537
00:22:41,096 --> 00:22:41,988
You better don't be late.

538
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:43,348
Yes, madam.

539
00:23:06,936 --> 00:23:07,777
Wait.

540
00:23:08,056 --> 00:23:09,576
I think we can only see this place

541
00:23:09,576 --> 00:23:10,696
in dramas, right?

542
00:23:10,696 --> 00:23:11,897
Ms Yang, you do live up
to your name as a great lawyer.

543
00:23:12,176 --> 00:23:13,936
This is amazing.
The entire building is ours now.

544
00:23:13,936 --> 00:23:14,897
This is so cool.

545
00:23:15,416 --> 00:23:17,176
In the future, Ms Dong and Mr Fei

546
00:23:17,176 --> 00:23:20,096
can hold their technique class

547
00:23:20,096 --> 00:23:21,576
and acupuncture class here.

548
00:23:22,416 --> 00:23:23,696
I like this place.

549
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:25,816
This place is pretty good.

550
00:23:25,816 --> 00:23:27,416
It's much better than Liu's old place.

551
00:23:27,576 --> 00:23:28,537
What are you doing here?

552
00:23:29,336 --> 00:23:30,324
I'll ask you again.

553
00:23:30,897 --> 00:23:31,785
Heroine, please spare me.

554
00:23:31,816 --> 00:23:33,657
I'm here to atone for my mistake.

555
00:23:34,657 --> 00:23:35,613
What mistake?

556
00:23:35,816 --> 00:23:37,377
The beds used for technique class

557
00:23:37,377 --> 00:23:38,216
and ordinary tables and chairs

558
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:39,416
are in the warehouse.

559
00:23:39,576 --> 00:23:41,056
Today, I'll return

560
00:23:41,296 --> 00:23:42,296
all of them.

561
00:23:43,576 --> 00:23:44,480
Professor Ren,

562
00:23:44,696 --> 00:23:46,216
I, Liu Zi Hong,
will work as a free labourer

563
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:48,336
and report for duty

564
00:23:48,336 --> 00:23:49,176
with your possessions.

565
00:23:49,416 --> 00:23:50,296
I shall obey

566
00:23:50,296 --> 00:23:51,216
your every instruction.

567
00:23:51,416 --> 00:23:52,348
Young Master.

568
00:23:54,056 --> 00:23:55,176
Since you're flexible,
you'll be in charge

569
00:23:55,176 --> 00:23:56,897
of cleaning the spots

570
00:23:56,897 --> 00:23:58,336
-where normal people can't.
-That's right.

571
00:23:58,696 --> 00:24:00,105
Don't think of leaving the place
before everything is done.

572
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:03,723
Guys,

573
00:24:04,033 --> 00:24:04,957
time to get to work!

574
00:24:23,936 --> 00:24:24,816
I thought you said

575
00:24:24,816 --> 00:24:26,056
you were going to perform well today?

576
00:24:26,056 --> 00:24:26,897
Look at you slacking off again.

577
00:24:27,816 --> 00:24:29,537
I'm doing something
a class leader should do.

578
00:24:30,017 --> 00:24:31,936
Look, everyone in the group

579
00:24:31,936 --> 00:24:32,977
knows it by now.

580
00:24:36,816 --> 00:24:39,216
This has to be measured in accordance
with the volume of water. Can you do it?

581
00:24:39,576 --> 00:24:40,816
That's why I'm here,

582
00:24:40,816 --> 00:24:41,777
student of science.

583
00:24:42,456 --> 00:24:43,387
Alright.

584
00:24:43,416 --> 00:24:44,340
I'll teach you.

585
00:24:52,296 --> 00:24:53,184
Young Master,

586
00:24:53,456 --> 00:24:55,137
didn't you say that
you have a flexible body?

587
00:24:55,416 --> 00:24:56,737
Can you just do your part cleanly?

588
00:24:56,936 --> 00:24:58,657
Ren Tian Zhen, can you support
the ladder for real?

589
00:24:58,696 --> 00:24:59,816
I'm scared.

590
00:24:59,816 --> 00:25:00,696
Don't worry.

591
00:25:00,696 --> 00:25:02,096
I'm supporting it with my strength.

592
00:25:02,096 --> 00:25:03,657
Hold tight.

593
00:25:04,816 --> 00:25:06,296
This isn't the right time
for me to come.

594
00:25:16,336 --> 00:25:18,017
Tou Tou, pass me the cloth.

595
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:19,004
I'll rinse it for you.

596
00:25:20,216 --> 00:25:21,176
I dare not do so.

597
00:25:21,176 --> 00:25:22,216
Your hands are too precious for it.

598
00:25:22,216 --> 00:25:23,113
Just rest.

599
00:25:23,296 --> 00:25:24,416
Mr Ren said

600
00:25:24,897 --> 00:25:26,056
we must attend to everything ourselves.

601
00:25:26,296 --> 00:25:27,696
Do not fail to commit an act of kindness
just because it is small in scale.

602
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:29,535
Come on.

603
00:25:41,537 --> 00:25:42,816
I was just being courteous.

604
00:25:43,056 --> 00:25:43,897
But why?

605
00:25:43,897 --> 00:25:44,936
I need to keep my promise anyway.

606
00:25:45,056 --> 00:25:45,980
Hurry up.

607
00:25:48,576 --> 00:25:50,096
Can you wipe other areas too?

608
00:25:50,096 --> 00:25:51,497
Look at your right.

609
00:25:57,696 --> 00:25:59,017
-Right.
-Be gentle.

610
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,184
Left.

611
00:26:01,576 --> 00:26:02,816
The left is pretty clean.

612
00:26:02,938 --> 00:26:03,793
Meng Meng,

613
00:26:03,897 --> 00:26:04,777
what's the matter?

614
00:26:08,936 --> 00:26:09,777
Meng Meng,

615
00:26:09,936 --> 00:26:11,176
you look like you're in a bad mood.

616
00:26:11,416 --> 00:26:12,336
Why don't you return to
the medical centre

617
00:26:12,336 --> 00:26:14,056
and play with Jian Xi?

618
00:26:14,176 --> 00:26:16,377
It's fine. I won't cause you
any trouble.

619
00:26:16,897 --> 00:26:18,096
That's not what I meant.

620
00:26:19,176 --> 00:26:20,113
What about this?

621
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:20,920
You can join Mum

622
00:26:20,936 --> 00:26:22,216
in helping the movers

623
00:26:22,296 --> 00:26:23,537
to arrange the beds we need
for the technique class.

624
00:26:23,696 --> 00:26:24,660
What do you think?

625
00:26:26,576 --> 00:26:27,449
Go now.

626
00:26:29,056 --> 00:26:29,977
Mum is over there.

627
00:26:30,296 --> 00:26:31,199
Go and find her.

628
00:26:35,416 --> 00:26:36,416
You're slacking off again.

629
00:26:36,897 --> 00:26:37,754
I...

630
00:26:37,936 --> 00:26:38,857
If I don't keep an eye on you,

631
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:39,936
you'll start

632
00:26:39,936 --> 00:26:41,176
to slack off.

633
00:26:42,777 --> 00:26:44,336
You injured me. I can't clean it now.

634
00:26:44,696 --> 00:26:45,777
Why are you saying?

635
00:26:45,816 --> 00:26:47,056
Hurry up. Continue.

636
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:50,216
You'd better clean them well

637
00:26:50,216 --> 00:26:51,336
or else we have to clean them again.

638
00:26:53,696 --> 00:26:54,519
Fine.

639
00:26:57,176 --> 00:26:58,737
They're so slow.

640
00:27:07,216 --> 00:27:08,137
Change your direction.

641
00:27:09,216 --> 00:27:10,137
What direction?

642
00:27:10,176 --> 00:27:11,137
Isn't this...

643
00:27:11,576 --> 00:27:12,590
Enough.

644
00:27:27,816 --> 00:27:29,336
Why are you playing with this too?

645
00:27:29,816 --> 00:27:32,257
I'm a woman too.

646
00:27:33,696 --> 00:27:35,017
You're different from the rest.

647
00:27:35,897 --> 00:27:36,871
How am I

648
00:27:37,056 --> 00:27:39,017
different from the rest?

649
00:27:39,017 --> 00:27:40,416
I want to be like them.

650
00:27:40,537 --> 00:27:41,657
I'm afraid of ageing too.

651
00:27:41,657 --> 00:27:43,296
I wish to be beautiful too.

652
00:27:44,056 --> 00:27:45,936
However, you don't mind at all.

653
00:27:46,576 --> 00:27:47,977
To me...

654
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:53,416
So, to you,

655
00:27:53,936 --> 00:27:54,777
what kind of person am I?

656
00:27:56,017 --> 00:27:56,887
I'll be frank here.

657
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:58,416
To me,

658
00:27:58,696 --> 00:27:59,936
beauty

659
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:02,377
isn't your forte.

660
00:28:11,816 --> 00:28:14,257
I met Mr Tu today.

661
00:28:14,257 --> 00:28:16,537
Mr Tu mentioned his daughter.

662
00:28:16,816 --> 00:28:18,576
Ming Meng. Do you remember her?

663
00:28:19,416 --> 00:28:20,576
She got into the postgraduate program

664
00:28:20,816 --> 00:28:22,216
in our city.

665
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:24,519
Ming Meng?

666
00:28:26,176 --> 00:28:27,096
I have a good impression

667
00:28:27,096 --> 00:28:28,657
of that lass.

668
00:28:29,017 --> 00:28:30,336
She was well-mannered

669
00:28:30,576 --> 00:28:31,936
and well-educated.

670
00:28:33,576 --> 00:28:35,176
She's a great fit for Tian Zhen.

671
00:28:35,816 --> 00:28:37,096
Ask her if she has a boyfriend.

672
00:28:37,296 --> 00:28:39,017
Do you think I look like
that kind of person?

673
00:28:41,056 --> 00:28:42,257
But Mr Tu did ask me

674
00:28:42,296 --> 00:28:44,216
if Tian Zhen had any girlfriends.

675
00:28:44,537 --> 00:28:46,216
Actually, he wants me

676
00:28:47,017 --> 00:28:48,576
to create a chance for them

677
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:50,296
so that they can

678
00:28:50,696 --> 00:28:52,137
return to being childhood friends.

679
00:28:55,336 --> 00:28:56,617
You see?

680
00:28:57,056 --> 00:28:59,456
This is what we call
a match made in heaven.

681
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,017
How did you answer him?

682
00:29:02,216 --> 00:29:03,497
I brushed it off with a yawn.

683
00:29:04,416 --> 00:29:05,285
You...

684
00:29:06,056 --> 00:29:06,897
I told him I was never

685
00:29:06,897 --> 00:29:08,176
concerned about the child.

686
00:29:11,017 --> 00:29:11,910
As for you,

687
00:29:13,056 --> 00:29:14,416
do you think your son will obey you

688
00:29:14,696 --> 00:29:15,777
when it comes to finding a girlfriend?

689
00:29:19,576 --> 00:29:20,777
It's not like

690
00:29:20,897 --> 00:29:22,657
he must obey me.

691
00:29:22,936 --> 00:29:24,696
I'm just worried about him.

692
00:29:25,296 --> 00:29:26,090
Our son

693
00:29:26,897 --> 00:29:28,416
is too innocent.

694
00:29:28,416 --> 00:29:29,816
I'm just afraid

695
00:29:30,296 --> 00:29:31,456
that he might do something he'll regret

696
00:29:31,456 --> 00:29:32,456
out of impulse.

697
00:29:32,777 --> 00:29:33,598
What if

698
00:29:34,897 --> 00:29:36,296
he spends the rest of
his life unhappily?

699
00:29:36,296 --> 00:29:37,336
If that happens...

700
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:41,545
I think

701
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:42,737
Xu Meng

702
00:29:42,737 --> 00:29:44,296
is clinging onto Tian Zhen.

703
00:29:46,336 --> 00:29:47,216
You are

704
00:29:47,936 --> 00:29:48,801
overthinking it.

705
00:29:49,096 --> 00:29:50,576
Everyone is busy

706
00:29:50,576 --> 00:29:52,096
with the opening of
our apprentice class.

707
00:29:52,336 --> 00:29:53,497
They spend their time together

708
00:29:53,696 --> 00:29:55,056
from day until night.

709
00:29:55,936 --> 00:29:57,456
I didn't discover anything strange

710
00:29:57,456 --> 00:29:59,137
between

711
00:29:59,537 --> 00:30:00,537
Tian Zhen and Meng Meng.

712
00:30:00,816 --> 00:30:02,137
Of course you didn't.

713
00:30:02,137 --> 00:30:02,936
You don't understand it at all.

714
00:30:03,216 --> 00:30:04,096
I don't understand it?

715
00:30:04,416 --> 00:30:05,216
Tou Tou spends time

716
00:30:05,216 --> 00:30:06,216
with them all day long.

717
00:30:06,816 --> 00:30:08,657
Why didn't you talk about her then?

718
00:30:09,816 --> 00:30:10,684
Tou Tou?

719
00:30:10,816 --> 00:30:12,977
She's just

720
00:30:13,537 --> 00:30:14,336
hopelessly clueless.

721
00:30:32,576 --> 00:30:33,576
What's wrong with you today?

722
00:30:34,696 --> 00:30:35,977
We finally had time for class today.

723
00:30:35,977 --> 00:30:37,416
Why are you sitting here alone?

724
00:30:37,416 --> 00:30:38,296
Do you have a stomach ache?

725
00:30:38,296 --> 00:30:39,216
Do you feel sick?

726
00:30:39,816 --> 00:30:40,816
I'm stretching.

727
00:30:42,816 --> 00:30:43,723
Stretching?

728
00:30:44,296 --> 00:30:45,416
I keep feeling like

729
00:30:45,816 --> 00:30:47,336
Meng Meng is troubled lately.

730
00:30:47,576 --> 00:30:48,696
Did you feel it too?

731
00:30:49,416 --> 00:30:50,537
What can she fret upon?

732
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:52,293
It's...

733
00:30:52,911 --> 00:30:53,752
I feel like

734
00:30:53,936 --> 00:30:55,377
there's something strange
with her phone.

735
00:30:55,377 --> 00:30:56,176
It's as if there's a bomb in it.

736
00:30:56,696 --> 00:30:57,897
How did you sense that?

737
00:30:59,176 --> 00:31:00,176
She left her phone

738
00:31:00,176 --> 00:31:01,737
in the toilet that day.

739
00:31:02,096 --> 00:31:03,257
After that, I tried to unlock her phone.

740
00:31:03,416 --> 00:31:04,336
I kept trying

741
00:31:04,336 --> 00:31:05,816
to guess her password.

742
00:31:05,816 --> 00:31:07,096
I couldn't unlock it.

743
00:31:07,096 --> 00:31:08,617
I didn't know her password.

744
00:31:08,617 --> 00:31:10,696
When she came in, she...

745
00:31:14,657 --> 00:31:15,696
She stared at me just like that.

746
00:31:16,576 --> 00:31:17,543
She stared at me just like you.

747
00:31:17,816 --> 00:31:18,696
I was terrified.

748
00:31:19,056 --> 00:31:20,296
If you take my phone

749
00:31:20,296 --> 00:31:21,216
and try to unlock it,

750
00:31:21,576 --> 00:31:22,936
I'll do the same thing.

751
00:31:23,816 --> 00:31:24,657
Instead of reflecting upon

752
00:31:24,657 --> 00:31:25,816
your thief-like behaviour,

753
00:31:25,816 --> 00:31:26,777
you're actually criticizing her?

754
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:27,996
Who said I'm a thief?

755
00:31:28,176 --> 00:31:29,096
How could you say that?

756
00:31:29,096 --> 00:31:30,296
You're being unfair here.

757
00:31:30,537 --> 00:31:32,296
I'm just worried about her.

758
00:31:33,657 --> 00:31:34,576
Besides,

759
00:31:35,537 --> 00:31:36,897
I don't need a password
to unlock my phone.

760
00:31:37,816 --> 00:31:39,336
I have nothing to fear.

761
00:31:39,336 --> 00:31:40,576
There's no need for any passwords.

762
00:31:40,576 --> 00:31:41,737
Your phone?

763
00:31:42,176 --> 00:31:43,336
It's either you buy candied hawthorns

764
00:31:43,336 --> 00:31:44,416
or sachima

765
00:31:44,416 --> 00:31:45,737
with your phone.

766
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:46,657
No one has time for that.

767
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,456
How did you know I was buying sachima?

768
00:31:55,897 --> 00:31:57,017
Did you sneak a peek?

769
00:31:57,657 --> 00:31:59,176
Did you?

770
00:32:00,056 --> 00:32:01,017
If so, how did you know?

771
00:32:01,576 --> 00:32:02,416
The seller said he would deliver it

772
00:32:02,416 --> 00:32:03,936
right after I paid for it.

773
00:32:04,456 --> 00:32:05,657
But it hasn't arrived yet.

774
00:32:05,897 --> 00:32:06,777
Let me check.

775
00:32:09,416 --> 00:32:11,816
So, the clueless Tou

776
00:32:11,816 --> 00:32:14,137
can actually detect
other people's emotions now.

777
00:32:14,416 --> 00:32:15,257
Sachima.

778
00:32:16,777 --> 00:32:17,897
Have you improved

779
00:32:18,056 --> 00:32:19,936
after all the training?

780
00:32:21,176 --> 00:32:22,816
Or is it because spring is here?

781
00:32:23,176 --> 00:32:25,696
Everything is coming back to life.

782
00:32:25,696 --> 00:32:26,696
It's mating season

783
00:32:26,696 --> 00:32:28,657
again.

784
00:32:32,696 --> 00:32:34,416
Cut the crap.

785
00:32:34,416 --> 00:32:35,657
I'm busy every day.

786
00:32:35,897 --> 00:32:37,537
I have no time

787
00:32:38,296 --> 00:32:39,336
to think about such things.

788
00:32:56,936 --> 00:32:58,296
Why are you staring at me?

789
00:33:01,657 --> 00:33:02,696
Help me down.

790
00:33:07,426 --> 00:33:08,335
What's wrong?

791
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,160
Can't you be gentle?

792
00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:12,936
Alright. I'll be gentle.

793
00:33:12,936 --> 00:33:13,879
Come.

794
00:33:14,336 --> 00:33:15,777
Are you dating Meng Meng?

795
00:33:16,816 --> 00:33:17,691
What?

796
00:33:20,576 --> 00:33:21,394
What's the matter?

797
00:33:23,576 --> 00:33:24,426
I said,

798
00:33:25,416 --> 00:33:26,816
are you dating

799
00:33:26,816 --> 00:33:28,696
Meng Meng?

800
00:33:31,017 --> 00:33:31,816
That's none of your business.

801
00:33:35,576 --> 00:33:36,512
Ren Tian Zhen!

802
00:34:10,576 --> 00:34:11,696
Great timing.

803
00:34:12,416 --> 00:34:14,377
Are you okay with having
shrimp dumplings today?

804
00:34:14,377 --> 00:34:15,176
Is ten enough?

805
00:34:15,576 --> 00:34:16,537
Ten?

806
00:34:17,336 --> 00:34:18,296
I'm starving.

807
00:34:18,576 --> 00:34:20,416
-Can we have more?
-Alright. We'll have 15.

808
00:34:20,416 --> 00:34:22,216
There's a shrimp in every dumpling.

809
00:34:22,216 --> 00:34:23,137
I'm sure you'll be full.

810
00:34:26,096 --> 00:34:28,897
By the way, you came home
pretty late recently.

811
00:34:29,096 --> 00:34:30,216
I guess you're busy

812
00:34:30,216 --> 00:34:31,137
now that the apprentice class
has been reopened.

813
00:34:34,537 --> 00:34:35,576
I heard from Tou Tou

814
00:34:35,576 --> 00:34:37,857
that Mr Ren would hold
an open class tomorrow.

815
00:34:37,857 --> 00:34:38,696
Tomorrow's my rest day too.

816
00:34:38,696 --> 00:34:39,537
I want to attend it.

817
00:34:39,576 --> 00:34:40,449
Do you want to join me?

818
00:34:41,096 --> 00:34:42,336
It's okay.

819
00:34:42,696 --> 00:34:44,056
I have something else to do
tomorrow morning.

820
00:34:46,456 --> 00:34:47,296
I can't make it.

821
00:34:52,777 --> 00:34:54,576
You're not attending
the apprentice class?

822
00:34:54,897 --> 00:34:55,936
No.

823
00:34:57,176 --> 00:34:58,121
You see,

824
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:59,537
I have something important to do.

825
00:35:04,176 --> 00:35:05,416
(What are you guys doing?)

826
00:35:05,816 --> 00:35:07,497
(Show yourselves.)

827
00:35:07,696 --> 00:35:08,777
(This is a group announcement.)

828
00:35:09,216 --> 00:35:11,336
(This is an announcement
of the new apprentice class.)

829
00:35:11,816 --> 00:35:13,257
(On a beautiful day)

830
00:35:13,296 --> 00:35:14,816
(like this,)

831
00:35:15,296 --> 00:35:16,257
(our apprentice class)

832
00:35:16,296 --> 00:35:18,576
(has finally been reopened)

833
00:35:18,816 --> 00:35:21,216
(after many hardships.)

834
00:35:22,056 --> 00:35:23,696
(Our first mission)

835
00:35:23,936 --> 00:35:25,416
(is to do spring cleaning.)

836
00:35:25,696 --> 00:35:27,657
(Please get into your positions)

837
00:35:27,816 --> 00:35:29,017
(and do your jobs.)

838
00:35:29,336 --> 00:35:30,936
(Let us help out)

839
00:35:31,216 --> 00:35:32,176
(our family.)

840
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,871
(Beginning of Summer
means the end of Spring.)

841
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,684
(As the name implies,
it's the beginning of Summer.)

842
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:45,105
(Sunlight, temperature
and rain gradually increase.)

843
00:35:45,637 --> 00:35:50,642
(It's the phase where crops
are growing abundantly.)

844
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,321
(Beginning of Summer)

845
00:36:12,936 --> 00:36:13,894
Okay.

846
00:36:14,696 --> 00:36:15,552
Are you a newcomer?

847
00:36:15,577 --> 00:36:16,416
-Yeah.
-Over here.

848
00:36:18,136 --> 00:36:19,777
Write down your contact number.

849
00:36:19,777 --> 00:36:20,656
Write them down.

850
00:36:22,817 --> 00:36:24,497
-Newbie?
-Yeah.

851
00:36:25,856 --> 00:36:26,824
Fill up the form.

852
00:36:27,577 --> 00:36:28,473
Madam.

853
00:36:31,376 --> 00:36:32,216
Mr Ren.

854
00:36:33,616 --> 00:36:34,577
Mr Ren, Madam.

855
00:36:34,577 --> 00:36:35,696
Ms Dong.

856
00:36:35,696 --> 00:36:36,616
Where should we put the flowers?

857
00:36:37,577 --> 00:36:39,216
How many times have I told you guys

858
00:36:39,216 --> 00:36:40,656
not to buy this?

859
00:36:40,896 --> 00:36:41,936
Our class just reopened,

860
00:36:41,936 --> 00:36:42,936
yet you're spending so much on it.

861
00:36:42,936 --> 00:36:44,057
I would rather you donate the money

862
00:36:44,057 --> 00:36:45,537
to our class.

863
00:36:46,017 --> 00:36:46,936
We did.

864
00:36:46,936 --> 00:36:47,856
We did donate to the class too.

865
00:36:47,856 --> 00:36:49,017
This is something extra.

866
00:36:49,696 --> 00:36:51,017
You said so yourself.

867
00:36:51,017 --> 00:36:52,896
We need to create a good atmosphere
during opening ceremonies.

868
00:36:53,057 --> 00:36:54,297
This is a token of appreciation

869
00:36:54,297 --> 00:36:55,376
from the class leader

870
00:36:55,376 --> 00:36:56,896
and the other students.

871
00:36:56,896 --> 00:36:58,297
We hope that the apprentice class

872
00:36:58,577 --> 00:36:59,856
can be held smoothly.

873
00:36:59,856 --> 00:37:00,737
Alright, I appreciate that.

874
00:37:01,017 --> 00:37:02,136
-Leave it here.
-Okay.

875
00:37:03,856 --> 00:37:05,376
Congratulations.

876
00:37:05,376 --> 00:37:06,216
Congratulations.

877
00:37:06,216 --> 00:37:07,376
Good things come in pairs.

878
00:37:07,376 --> 00:37:08,537
Today's a happy day.

879
00:37:08,537 --> 00:37:09,376
Welcome.

880
00:37:09,376 --> 00:37:10,376
Mr Liu.

881
00:37:10,376 --> 00:37:11,376
May you be blessed with
double happiness.

882
00:37:11,376 --> 00:37:12,216
Dad, I'll make a move first.

883
00:37:12,896 --> 00:37:13,696
Brat!

884
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:14,737
How could you leave it here?

885
00:37:15,097 --> 00:37:15,936
Come.

886
00:37:17,896 --> 00:37:18,896
Thank you for the flowers.

887
00:37:19,577 --> 00:37:20,473
Okay.

888
00:37:21,097 --> 00:37:22,216
How do we use it?

889
00:37:22,777 --> 00:37:24,616
I don't know.
I'm trying to figure it out too.

890
00:37:25,057 --> 00:37:25,988
Which side is the head?

891
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:27,582
Hey, I'll go deaf, you know?

892
00:37:29,017 --> 00:37:29,856
This is fun.

893
00:37:29,856 --> 00:37:30,769
Are they the same?

894
00:37:32,176 --> 00:37:33,297
Come. I'll help you out.

895
00:37:33,577 --> 00:37:34,896
Look. There's an arrow here.

896
00:37:37,337 --> 00:37:38,656
This confetti is nice.

897
00:37:39,019 --> 00:37:39,817
Let me get one.

898
00:37:39,817 --> 00:37:41,017
What are you two doing?

899
00:37:41,017 --> 00:37:41,936
Is there a wedding?

900
00:37:42,136 --> 00:37:43,097
My dear!

901
00:37:44,696 --> 00:37:45,856
What are you doing here?

902
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:47,918
Did you come here alone?

903
00:37:48,817 --> 00:37:49,616
Where's Quan?

904
00:37:50,241 --> 00:37:51,055
Hey.

905
00:37:51,136 --> 00:37:52,656
It's been a few days
since we last saw him.

906
00:37:53,376 --> 00:37:54,896
Didn't he go to the medical centre

907
00:37:54,896 --> 00:37:55,977
and attend the apprentice class lately?

908
00:37:56,856 --> 00:37:57,817
Before this, we thought

909
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:59,136
the apprentice class would be cancelled.

910
00:37:59,136 --> 00:38:00,696
That's why he was
looking for other jobs.

911
00:38:01,057 --> 00:38:02,936
But I thought he would come back
after the apprentice class

912
00:38:02,936 --> 00:38:03,737
has been reopened.

913
00:38:04,376 --> 00:38:06,017
Didn't he tell you anything?

914
00:38:06,777 --> 00:38:08,376
Oh yeah. He said

915
00:38:08,616 --> 00:38:10,297
he's not coming as he has something else
to do this morning.

916
00:38:10,297 --> 00:38:11,176
I'm here to help him apply for leave.

917
00:38:15,537 --> 00:38:17,176
How much does this cost?

918
00:38:21,936 --> 00:38:22,817
This is great.

919
00:38:24,936 --> 00:38:27,057
Professor, I checked the place out.

920
00:38:27,097 --> 00:38:28,936
It's much better

921
00:38:28,936 --> 00:38:30,136
than my previous place.

922
00:38:30,416 --> 00:38:31,348
It's pretty good.

923
00:38:31,896 --> 00:38:32,746
It's pretty good.

924
00:38:33,896 --> 00:38:34,793
Professor,

925
00:38:35,297 --> 00:38:36,577
you see,

926
00:38:36,577 --> 00:38:38,057
I'm still passionate
toward Chinese medicine.

927
00:38:38,376 --> 00:38:40,136
Although the process was excruciating,

928
00:38:40,136 --> 00:38:42,337
the end result was fulfilling.

929
00:38:43,176 --> 00:38:44,297
I think I'm one of the contributors

930
00:38:44,577 --> 00:38:45,616
to the reopening

931
00:38:45,616 --> 00:38:46,616
of our apprentice class, right?

932
00:38:47,136 --> 00:38:48,176
I'll definitely invest in you again

933
00:38:48,176 --> 00:38:49,737
if I make a comeback.

934
00:38:50,777 --> 00:38:52,136
Seems like you resolved
your financial crisis.

935
00:38:52,376 --> 00:38:53,696
Later, we have to talk about

936
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:55,216
how I can make a comeback after this.

937
00:38:56,856 --> 00:38:57,817
Let's drop the topic for now.

938
00:38:58,057 --> 00:38:59,017
This is a gift

939
00:39:00,537 --> 00:39:01,355
for your apprentice class.

940
00:39:02,456 --> 00:39:03,418
Here you go.

941
00:39:04,936 --> 00:39:05,856
Hey.

942
00:39:05,856 --> 00:39:07,577
You should at least check it out.

943
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:14,216
I dare not accept this.

944
00:39:14,216 --> 00:39:15,537
What? It's gilded.

945
00:39:16,376 --> 00:39:17,497
I got this all the way

946
00:39:17,497 --> 00:39:18,416
from Chokpori.

947
00:39:18,936 --> 00:39:19,817
The Medicine King figure

948
00:39:19,817 --> 00:39:21,376
implies

949
00:39:21,537 --> 00:39:23,337
that we'll ward off any diseases

950
00:39:23,337 --> 00:39:24,376
and stay safe with him around.

951
00:39:26,337 --> 00:39:28,136
If so, I'll thank you on

952
00:39:29,616 --> 00:39:30,577
-everyone's behalf.
-You have to accept it.

953
00:39:30,577 --> 00:39:31,656
-Thank you.
-You have to accept it.

954
00:39:31,656 --> 00:39:33,257
-I'll accept it then.
-Sure.

955
00:39:34,216 --> 00:39:35,137
Master!

956
00:39:35,856 --> 00:39:36,699
Master.

957
00:39:36,896 --> 00:39:38,497
Look who's here.

958
00:39:38,896 --> 00:39:39,977
I made it in time.

959
00:39:39,977 --> 00:39:41,376
This is great.

960
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:43,152
You are?

961
00:39:43,416 --> 00:39:44,537
Don't you recognize me?

962
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:45,936
I'm Jiang Li.

963
00:39:46,456 --> 00:39:47,936
Please pardon me.

964
00:39:47,936 --> 00:39:48,977
I cannot recognise people well.

965
00:39:49,297 --> 00:39:50,337
I had terminal cancer,

966
00:39:50,856 --> 00:39:51,936
and I only had

967
00:39:51,936 --> 00:39:54,616
three months to live.

968
00:39:56,136 --> 00:39:56,936
Professor Ren,

969
00:39:57,297 --> 00:39:58,656
just be honest with me.

970
00:39:59,136 --> 00:40:01,176
People tell me that if TCM practitioners

971
00:40:01,577 --> 00:40:02,577
introduce you

972
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,656
to Western doctors,

973
00:40:04,856 --> 00:40:07,017
that means you're terminally ill.

974
00:40:07,376 --> 00:40:08,376
If Western doctors introduce you

975
00:40:08,376 --> 00:40:09,977
to TCM practitioners,

976
00:40:09,977 --> 00:40:11,616
that means there's no hope.

977
00:40:12,416 --> 00:40:14,176
I'm already prepared.

978
00:40:17,337 --> 00:40:19,616
Look. Even a patient
with terminal cancer

979
00:40:19,896 --> 00:40:21,136
looks healthier than me.

980
00:40:21,656 --> 00:40:22,936
You finally recognised her.

981
00:40:23,616 --> 00:40:24,416
I didn't stay idle

982
00:40:24,416 --> 00:40:25,497
last year.

983
00:40:25,817 --> 00:40:26,616
I've travelled and hiked

984
00:40:26,616 --> 00:40:27,656
all kinds of mountains.

985
00:40:27,817 --> 00:40:28,616
I take tens of thousands of steps

986
00:40:28,616 --> 00:40:29,896
each day.

987
00:40:31,656 --> 00:40:32,715
It's been one year, right?

988
00:40:33,416 --> 00:40:34,497
Have you been to the hospital?

989
00:40:34,616 --> 00:40:35,480
I have.

990
00:40:35,856 --> 00:40:37,176
The cancer is gone.

991
00:40:38,376 --> 00:40:40,057
Misdiagnosis isn't that rare
for Western doctors.

992
00:40:40,936 --> 00:40:42,257
Mind your own business.

993
00:40:42,257 --> 00:40:43,057
Can you keep quiet?

994
00:40:43,057 --> 00:40:44,376
You're wrong.

995
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:47,057
Professor Ren is right.

996
00:40:47,216 --> 00:40:49,416
This is karma.

997
00:40:50,136 --> 00:40:51,416
I recovered

998
00:40:51,577 --> 00:40:52,434
after paying off my debts.

999
00:40:53,577 --> 00:40:55,577
I guess Buddha forgave you then.

1000
00:40:55,577 --> 00:40:57,456
Buddha even appeared in my dream

1001
00:40:57,456 --> 00:40:59,136
and told me that I'd recovered.

1002
00:41:01,136 --> 00:41:02,696
Buddha even told me

1003
00:41:02,696 --> 00:41:03,777
to pass a message to you, Professor Ren.

1004
00:41:08,856 --> 00:41:10,376
Saving a life...

1005
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:14,656
Is of boundless beneficence.

1006
00:41:16,297 --> 00:41:17,936
My husband wrote this.

1007
00:41:18,656 --> 00:41:20,456
He is thankful to you.

1008
00:41:21,856 --> 00:41:24,017
After my family went hiking together,

1009
00:41:24,216 --> 00:41:26,017
the health of my son and daughter

1010
00:41:26,017 --> 00:41:27,097
improved too.

1011
00:41:27,656 --> 00:41:30,017
And, our bonds

1012
00:41:30,656 --> 00:41:31,977
are stronger than ever.

1013
00:41:32,616 --> 00:41:33,737
Professor Ren,

1014
00:41:33,737 --> 00:41:35,376
it's all thanks to you.

1015
00:41:36,456 --> 00:41:37,817
Excellent writings.

1016
00:41:39,176 --> 00:41:40,043
Later,

1017
00:41:40,097 --> 00:41:41,696
you guys can hang it here.

1018
00:41:42,456 --> 00:41:43,577
When people come in,

1019
00:41:43,577 --> 00:41:44,777
they can see it immediately.

1020
00:41:44,777 --> 00:41:45,616
Isn't it great?

1021
00:41:45,616 --> 00:41:46,497
It's your signboard now.

1022
00:41:46,777 --> 00:41:47,616
It's our signboard!

1023
00:41:49,936 --> 00:41:50,801
Yes.

1024
00:41:55,216 --> 00:41:57,297
I'm elated today.

1025
00:41:58,456 --> 00:42:00,537
I wish to thank our kind sponsors,

1026
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:02,977
my master,

1027
00:42:03,656 --> 00:42:04,856
his wife,

1028
00:42:05,896 --> 00:42:07,057
and

1029
00:42:07,537 --> 00:42:10,376
everyone's favourite teacher,

1030
00:42:10,777 --> 00:42:11,691
Ms Song.

1031
00:42:12,136 --> 00:42:15,656
I would like to thank
all of you as well.

1032
00:42:16,216 --> 00:42:17,257
Today's the reopening

1033
00:42:17,856 --> 00:42:19,337
of our apprentice class.

1034
00:42:28,856 --> 00:42:30,577
There's another occasion
worth celebrating today.

1035
00:42:31,416 --> 00:42:33,577
I met an old patient of mine,

1036
00:42:33,856 --> 00:42:35,376
which is Madam Jiang Li.

1037
00:42:36,337 --> 00:42:37,176
Now,

1038
00:42:37,176 --> 00:42:39,777
I would like to invite her

1039
00:42:39,896 --> 00:42:41,097
to give us

1040
00:42:41,537 --> 00:42:42,577
an opening speech.

1041
00:42:43,376 --> 00:42:44,376
Everyone, give her a big hand.

1042
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,059
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

1043
00:42:57,176 --> 00:42:58,316
(are referenced from relevant
traditional Chinese medicine books)

1044
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,900
(Do not use without medical advice)
(End of Episode 24)
