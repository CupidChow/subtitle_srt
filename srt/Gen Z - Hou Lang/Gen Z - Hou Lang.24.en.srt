1
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,196
Hurry up. School's over.

2
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,680
We're only late a bit.

3
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,240
Le Le won't go anywhere.

4
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,316
I brought you here so that
we could steal the child together.

5
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,477
But look at you.

6
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,629
There's no point now.

7
00:00:31,713 --> 00:00:33,793
I'm sure Cheng Ying
has already taken Le Le.

8
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,040
We came here for nothing.

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,077
She's a woman.

10
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,680
How could I steal a child from a woman?

11
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,560
Besides,

12
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,757
-it's her child.
-Granny!

13
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,957
Even if you want to steal her child,
you should bring Brother here.

14
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,080
You should tell his father to come.

15
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,440
-Le Le!
-Le Le!

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,520
Le Le, my baby grandson!

17
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,800
-Come here, Le Le.
-Granny!

18
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,040
Slow down. You'll drop him!

19
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,000
Yeah, yeah.

20
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,120
Ms Zhang.

21
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,757
Le Le's Granny, this weekend,

22
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,757
we need them

23
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,477
to observe lotus leaves and fish

24
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,477
and record them

25
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,997
on their workbook.

26
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,397
We need them to take three photos.

27
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,560
Alright, I'll complete
the task with him.

28
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,637
We need his parents to join him.

29
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,557
Not his grandparents.

30
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,560
We want a family photo.

31
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,240
He needs to take a photo
with his parents?

32
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,117
Can he take it with his stepmother?

33
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,357
Sure.

34
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,237
Le Le's mother called me

35
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,557
and instructed me

36
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,880
to tell you about this.

37
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,360
She called you?

38
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,000
Isn't she here today?

39
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,437
She said you were coming today.

40
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,400
If you didn't,
I would call her.

41
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,960
Of course I'd be here.

42
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,637
Goodbye, Ms Zhang.

43
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,840
Okay. Take care.

44
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,080
Granny is here.

45
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,477
Baby grandson.

46
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,840
Look at what I bought for you. Take it.

47
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,000
Didn't your mother come to pick you up?

48
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,037
Mum said I'm going

49
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,277
to Dad's house this weekend.

50
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,560
She said you would pick me up.

51
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,717
Didn't she say anything?

52
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,677
Didn't she badmouth

53
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,757
your father or me?

54
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,677
-Mum!
-She didn't.

55
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,920
You're so narrow-minded.

56
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,757
You're badmouthing Sister-in-law

57
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,877
and stealing her child.

58
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,320
I told you already. My
sister-in-law isn't that kind of person.

59
00:01:55,401 --> 00:01:56,717
You still brought me here
to do your evil deed.

60
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,597
Look at what you've done.

61
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,040
I came here for nothing.

62
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,797
Listen.
She's just afraid of me.

63
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,160
I have evidence.

64
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,117
Listen.

65
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,800
I'm sure she's afraid of me.

66
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,760
I have evidence.

67
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,957
She's afraid that the court

68
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:11,837
might give me custody of Le Le

69
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,757
when we fight for him.

70
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,720
Yeah, yeah.

71
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,877
Le Le, can you prove it?

72
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,997
Your mother hit me

73
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,200
last week, right?

74
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,160
You pushed Mum first.

75
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,920
Heartless boy.

76
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,680
I did it for your sake.

77
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,200
Do you know who loves you the most?

78
00:02:28,346 --> 00:02:31,117
Listen.
I'm the one who loves you the most.

79
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,397
I was waiting for you

80
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,240
in front of the delivery room

81
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,040
before you were born.

82
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,180
Le Le, don't listen to Granny.

83
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,757
Granny is driving a wedge
between you and your mother.

84
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,957
Your mother loves you the most.

85
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:42,837
Understood?

86
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,680
Your grandmother is no match
for your mother.

87
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,317
You're so heartless.

88
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,317
I was just stating facts.

89
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,237
Why are you hitting me?

90
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,197
Will you be happy

91
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,477
if I say Grandma loves me

92
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,400
the most

93
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,400
instead of you?

94
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,917
Mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law
are born rivals.

95
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,080
Even so, you got yourself
two daughters-in-law.

96
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,640
It's hard to say. Maybe you'll
get a third one in the future.

97
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,040
She'll be my wife.

98
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,880
This kid.

99
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,640
He has a girlfriend now?

100
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,677
When will you bring

101
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,400
your girlfriend back?

102
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,760
This kid is something else.

103
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,800
(Qibo Medical Centre)

104
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,320
What are you doing?

105
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,397
-Calm down.
-Tian Zhen!

106
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,960
-What's wrong?
-This is huge.

107
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,117
-We're in trouble.
-What is it?

108
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,320
Bai Mo Li has a fever, right?

109
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,920
How did you know?

110
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,037
Don't ask me why. I just know it.

111
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,840
Tou Tou, pack your stuff and follow me.

112
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,157
Let's go.

113
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,080
Wait.

114
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,037
Tou Tou.

115
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,917
-Mr Ren.
-Coming!

116
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,800
She called you?

117
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,000
No.

118
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,440
Let's go.

119
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,837
Why did you only tell us by now?

120
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,200
It's already the third day.

121
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,197
My grandmother didn't tell me
she had a fever

122
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,160
on the first day.

123
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,237
On the second day, Dr Peng
gave her some medicine.

124
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,600
Her condition didn't
turn for the better after one day.

125
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,757
How long has she been taking

126
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,720
the new prescription?

127
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,480
She has one more dose left.

128
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,880
I've tried all kinds of methods to lower
her body temperature but to no avail.

129
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,197
Considering her age,

130
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,760
I was planning to send her
to the hospital.

131
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,640
But Mr Ren, she insisted on
bringing you here.

132
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,560
That was within my expectation.

133
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,677
Did you expect her to vomit blood

134
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,640
and have a high fever?

135
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,880
Do you really think you're a deity?

136
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,280
Dr Peng,

137
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,440
both of us are doctors.

138
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,677
You focus on Western medicine

139
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,960
while I focus on Chinese medicine.

140
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,560
Actually, the field of Western medicine
and Chinese medicine

141
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,840
have different explanations
for illnesses.

142
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,640
Western doctors like to use

143
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,880
strong words like

144
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,840
sedatives and disinfectant

145
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,320
to treat illnesses.

146
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,400
Actually, illnesses

147
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,720
aren't bad things.

148
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,357
They're just there

149
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,560
to remind our bodies.

150
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,320
She's having a fever now.

151
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,317
Actually, it's the conflict

152
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,000
between good and bad in her body.

153
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,677
To put it bluntly,

154
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,320
it's your immunity

155
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,320
trying to fight off the invaders.

156
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,037
At her age,

157
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,600
it's hard to develop a fever.

158
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,200
Try and develop a fever.

159
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,917
I think it's been a decade

160
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,960
since you last had a fever.

161
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,120
Yeah, I have a healthy body.

162
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,200
Not necessarily.

163
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,600
There's another type of possibility.

164
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,600
It's sub-health.

165
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,637
Actually, his body

166
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,520
has already surrendered.

167
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,640
If this keeps up,

168
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,560
other complications will occur.

169
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,680
You should stop bragging about
your capabilities.

170
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,600
Peng Shi Yan,

171
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,880
mind your words.

172
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,440
I've tolerated you for a long time.

173
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,720
I know there's a difference
between our fields.

174
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,717
But we should still
respect our teachers.

175
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,280
I do respect my teachers.

176
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,277
However, there's no difference
between students and teachers

177
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,720
when it comes to prudence
towards illnesses.

178
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,280
Am I right, Mr Ren?

179
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,200
You're right.

180
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,840
Madam Bai.

181
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,440
Why don't I give you
an acupuncture treatment?

182
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,797
Once it's over,

183
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,677
your fever should subside

184
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,160
after 45 minutes.

185
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,397
Dr Peng made her fever subside.

186
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,640
But it came back quickly.

187
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,280
Even if he can't do it,

188
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,600
that doesn't mean I can't do it.

189
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,040
How many needles will you use then?

190
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,840
One.

191
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,760
Only one?

192
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,400
Yes, only one.

193
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,280
And, it doesn't hurt too.

194
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,360
Tou Tou,

195
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,600
make some porridge for her.

196
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,520
She might be hungry after waking up.

197
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,720
Okay.

198
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,797
Madam Bai,

199
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,677
tell me

200
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,557
if you feel uncomfortable.

201
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,600
I'll send you to the hospital.

202
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,280
I'm not going to the hospital.

203
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,840
I want him to treat me.

204
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,677
None of us can bear the responsibility

205
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,240
if something does happen to you.

206
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,400
Dr Peng,

207
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,920
you know

208
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,560
that I'm a faithful person.

209
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,720
If God is trying to summon me to Heaven,

210
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,120
I will gladly accept it.

211
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,680
Madam Bai,

212
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,560
I will protect

213
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,960
your life.

214
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,720
It won't be easy for you to go

215
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,760
when I'm here with you.

216
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,840
After the treatment,

217
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,720
just close your eyes and rest.

218
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,240
It won't hurt at all.

219
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,200
You're making porridge?

220
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,000
So, foreigners have rice
in the house too?

221
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,160
They don't.

222
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,800
Now, even if your father

223
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,357
doesn't tell me anything,

224
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,760
I know what to take.

225
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,280
I brought it from

226
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,480
the medical centre.

227
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,197
Not bad at all, bootlicker.

228
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,120
Tell me the theory behind it then.

229
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,920
According to the 12th rule of
Treatise On Febrile Caused by Cold,

230
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,560
hot porridge should be consumed

231
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,440
together with Cinnamon Twig Decoction

232
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,480
to boost its effectiveness.

233
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,120
I'm making hot porridge.

234
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,360
That's why

235
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,320
I brought the Cinnamon Twig Decoction.

236
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,600
But your father...

237
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,040
Your father didn't say that
he needed it.

238
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,840
I brought it here for nothing.

239
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,397
Even now, I still don't understand

240
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,757
if your father wishes
to proceed with acupuncture treatment

241
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,840
or give her a prescription.

242
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,960
Do you have water?

243
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,160
I'm thirsty.

244
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,800
Yeah. What about some health tea?

245
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,600
That'll do.

246
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,720
It's inside the bag.

247
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,040
How many things have you brought here?

248
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,320
At the bottom.

249
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,080
You're finally doing decent work now.

250
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,160
Remember to insert money
into the money box.

251
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,917
You're trying to record your own merit?

252
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,277
We should do kind deeds
without expecting anything in return.

253
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,800
We shouldn't bring it up.

254
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,637
It's not like I'm bringing it up
on purpose.

255
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,757
You'll definitely forget

256
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,040
if I don't bring it up.

257
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,360
Can you remember it?

258
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,920
Maybe not.

259
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,160
Tou Tou.

260
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,840
Send it to your dad.

261
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,440
Her fever has subsided.

262
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,040
I'm a little hungry.

263
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,960
-You're hungry?
-Here.

264
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,640
Feed it to her while it's hot.
Feed her slowly.

265
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,960
Has she recovered then?

266
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,960
You can take some
Chinese medicine first.

267
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,720
After that, you can head to the hospital

268
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,480
to get a body check-up.

269
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,960
This way, you two

270
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,360
can rest at ease.

271
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,480
I trust you.

272
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,720
I feel relieved

273
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,240
since you said that I'm fine now.

274
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,197
Thank you for trusting me.

275
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,160
Eat up.

276
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,720
Do you admit defeat?

277
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,280
Do you?

278
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,080
-Eat up.
-Do you admit defeat?

279
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,760
I don't.

280
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,480
I won't admit defeat.

281
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,677
Listen. We Western doctors

282
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,277
have standard procedures to follow
when it comes to giving diagnoses

283
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,600
and prescribing medication.

284
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,757
Mr Ren, you just came here
and insert a needle into her arm.

285
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,837
How could we learn that?

286
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,339
What are you saying?
You're so noisy.

287
00:11:53,423 --> 00:11:54,582
You can't stop talking, huh?

288
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,720
Let's teach him a lesson.

289
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,160
You should've...

290
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,360
You three, leave.

291
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,320
Let Madam Bai rest.

292
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,480
This is unreasonable.

293
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,757
You're unreasonable.

294
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,800
Leave now.

295
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,746
Dr Peng,
you said it was unreasonable.

296
00:12:09,426 --> 00:12:10,346
That's not the case.

297
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,157
In Chinese medicine,

298
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,317
among Principles, Methods,
Formulas and Medicinals,

299
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,080
Principles is
the most important element.

300
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,280
Just now,

301
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:20,604
I was doing acupuncture.

302
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,040
We can call it

303
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,600
Principles, Methods,
Formulas and Needles.

304
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,160
Every needle I used

305
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,240
was based on Principles.

306
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,360
He still has no idea. Tou Tou.

307
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,200
Tell him.

308
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,960
I don't know either.

309
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,797
I haven't learned this yet.

310
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,837
How would I know?

311
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,120
You still don't know even after
learning under me for a long time?

312
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,720
Recite Rule 58 of
Treatise On Febrile Caused by Cold.

313
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,040
Rule 58 of
Treatise On Febrile Caused by Cold.

314
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,117
Illnesses with symptoms
like sweating, vomiting,

315
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,237
diarrhoea, bleeding,
and exhausting of body fluid,

316
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,920
achieving self-balance of Yin and Yang
will ensure recovery.

317
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,637
What did she mean

318
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,637
by that?

319
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,160
It means

320
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,397
that no matter how sick you are,

321
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,840
as long as you achieve self-balance,

322
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,280
you'll recover.

323
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,520
Self-balance?

324
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,557
Neiguan belongs to the Jueyin Meridian.

325
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,037
Among the Six Meridians,

326
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,280
Jueyin Meridian

327
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,040
represents the end of Yin
and the birth of Yang.

328
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,957
Madam Bai

329
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,400
has been sick for quite some time.

330
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,637
In the end,

331
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,440
we still need to depend on
the Jueyin Meridian to cure her.

332
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,160
She's old.

333
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,520
She already lacked Yang energy.

334
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,517
If you apply pressure
on the Neiguan point,

335
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,440
once the Yang energy rises,

336
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,200
self-balance will be achieved.

337
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,280
The illness will be cured by then.

338
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,837
You see, in Chinese medicine,

339
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,600
we don't fight illnesses.

340
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,720
We strive to achieve balance.

341
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,960
We don't expect people

342
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,920
to be 100% healthy.

343
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,920
No such people exist too.

344
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,600
We just expect our body

345
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,157
to be 51% healthy.

346
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,480
It's fine as long as health
is the major shareholder.

347
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,800
Both strengths and weaknesses

348
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,040
have their own balance to maintain.

349
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,000
Got it?

350
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:15,960
Understood?

351
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,920
Master, I think

352
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,600
I can only make
Cinnamon Twig Decoction now.

353
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:21,877
I still have no way

354
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,240
to understand such deep theories.

355
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,160
Acupuncture and brewing medicine

356
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,920
are still too tough for me.

357
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,040
I can't just use whatever I like.

358
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,400
I'm just skilful at certain things.

359
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,197
When it comes to acupuncture
and brewing medicine,

360
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,557
I have complete confidence in them.

361
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,520
However, when it comes to techniques,

362
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,160
I'm inferior to Ms Dong.

363
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:41,920
Of course.

364
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,360
But to you...

365
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,440
Dr Ren.

366
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,600
I don't know

367
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,197
how I can express my gratitude.

368
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,600
Don't mention it.

369
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,240
I just did

370
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,560
what a doctor should do.

371
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,040
To you, it may be your duty.

372
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,317
But to me,

373
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,640
to my family,

374
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,117
you've resolved

375
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,400
a troublesome issue for us.

376
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,720
Donation for education?

377
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,957
This is too much money.

378
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,040
I cannot accept this.

379
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,160
Dr Ren, I heard

380
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:21,637
that the class you are holding

381
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,640
is facing financial issues.

382
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,840
Your capabilities

383
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,840
aren't used to earn money.

384
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,640
They are used to cure people.

385
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,280
Now,

386
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,517
I will show you my capabilities.

387
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,960
Thank you so much.

388
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,520
I understand your feelings.

389
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,877
I understand why you're
donating to our cause.

390
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,920
However, I won't be able
to live in peace

391
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,757
if your family's finance
is affected because of this.

392
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,917
That's why

393
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,160
I cannot accept this.

394
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,120
Dr Ren,

395
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,040
our finance will be fine.

396
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,077
I thought Madam Bai was a teacher?

397
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,637
Do foreign teachers get a high salary?

398
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,640
You see,

399
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,960
we're from the Lauder family.

400
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,680
Louder?

401
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,400
Lauder.

402
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,520
What?

403
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,877
Lauder.

404
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,840
What does that mean?

405
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,360
It's fine.

406
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,080
That doesn't matter.

407
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,560
Anyway,

408
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,240
I'm very wealthy.

409
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,600
I'm much wealthier than usual teachers.

410
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,680
You can take the money.

411
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,280
(Qibo Medical Centre)

412
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,400
-Tian Zhen!
-Madam.

413
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,760
Mum.

414
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,997
Come with me to the house

415
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,160
on Anfu Street.

416
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,357
Your grandfather called just now.

417
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,877
There's a potential buyer

418
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,437
who took a liking to our house.

419
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,957
He wants us to sign the contract

420
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,760
with the real estate agency.

421
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,237
What are you smiling at?

422
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,600
We're selling our house, you know?

423
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,760
I'm not smiling.

424
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,040
After signing the contract,

425
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,637
we have

426
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,077
to clean up the house.

427
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,197
We'll discard unwanted things.

428
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,757
As for the rest, we can move them

429
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,920
to your grandparents' house.

430
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,960
Don't tire yourself out.

431
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,197
Just call a waste collector

432
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,520
to collect everything.

433
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,557
Collect everything?

434
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,760
That won't do.

435
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,720
Although they don't worth much,

436
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,077
many of them contain memories

437
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,240
of me and my son, am I right?

438
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,157
Of course,

439
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,437
it has nothing to do with you.

440
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,640
Yeah, yeah.

441
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,240
You can keep them then.

442
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,400
Keep them?

443
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,560
How can we sell the house

444
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,120
if we keep those things?

445
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,520
We're not selling the house.

446
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,680
We're not selling it?

447
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,840
How can we sustain
the apprentice class then?

448
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,320
I'm rich now.

449
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,800
You're rich?

450
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,200
Show it to me then.

451
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,400
Give me the money.

452
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,160
Give me the money.

453
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,720
Wait, I...

454
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,640
Keep on pretending, won't you?

455
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,720
Wait,

456
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,360
you weren't joking?

457
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,360
But...

458
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,360
Where did you get the money?

459
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,680
I told you already. I'll get it

460
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,360
when I want to.

461
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,160
He got it.

462
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,077
If so,

463
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,960
why didn't you get it earlier?

464
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,760
We were worried

465
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,640
for such a long time.

466
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,640
God gave us a chance

467
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,277
to show us

468
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,400
how petty you are.

469
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,640
I'm petty?

470
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,677
-Sorry, Mum.
-You knew long ago?

471
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,640
See you!

472
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,320
Like father, like son.

473
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,000
Tou Tou, give me that check!

474
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,440
Hong.

475
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,400
Rebecca.

476
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,197
I'm sorry.

477
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,520
I was irresponsible with what I said.

478
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,120
I know you're a magnanimous person.

479
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,880
Don't hold it against me.

480
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,160
Look.

481
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,557
I even prepared

482
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,640
your favourite

483
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:35,957
sugar-free yogurt for you.

484
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:36,920
Treat it as my apology.

485
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,200
Please forgive me.

486
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:40,917
Did you even say anything

487
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,440
that was worth being angry over?

488
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,117
-Mr Ren.
-Hong.

489
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,040
I have good news.

490
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,437
I found a place.

491
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,080
They can rent it to us for our class.

492
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,400
Do you want to check it out?

493
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,600
What? Are you also trying
to hold a candle to the devil?

494
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,560
Where is it?

495
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,120
No.

496
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,360
If you say no, that means no.

497
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,640
You just

498
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,520
maligned me for holding a candle
to the devil

499
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,557
without finding out what was going on

500
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,240
and said that I was
the accomplice to his murder.

501
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,517
That's not it.
I was flustered back then.

502
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,640
I couldn't think straight.

503
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,797
And,

504
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,837
you only pay full attention

505
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,797
to your

506
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,080
godson.

507
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,760
Did you see those people?

508
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,640
People who come here

509
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,237
have their own issues

510
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,760
more or less.

511
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,437
However, they always get cured

512
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,480
when they come here.

513
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,037
Although I'm doing nothing much,

514
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:33,957
I can make people

515
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,880
feel happy.

516
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,637
Sometimes,

517
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,640
happiness

518
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,680
isn't about how much you get.

519
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,720
It's about how much you give.

520
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,077
What are you still doing here?

521
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,520
Have you lost your job? Don't you
need to return to the hospital?

522
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,400
Oh yeah, I forgot to apply for leave.

523
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,120
So, you're not angry at me anymore?

524
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,640
For our new apprentice class,

525
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,717
we need labour

526
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,280
to clean up our new place.

527
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,800
I'll send you the schedule.

528
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:06,920
You better don't be late.

529
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,280
Yes, madam.

530
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,720
Wait.

531
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,437
I think we can only see this place

532
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,557
in dramas, right?

533
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,840
Ms Yang, you do live up
to your name as a great lawyer.

534
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,797
This is amazing.
The entire building is ours now.

535
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,840
This is so cool.

536
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,037
In the future, Ms Dong and Mr Fei

537
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,957
can hold their technique class

538
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,520
and acupuncture class here.

539
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,640
I like this place.

540
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,360
This place is pretty good.
It's much better than Liu's old place.

541
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,480
What are you doing here?

542
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,280
I'll ask you again.

543
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,677
Heroine, please spare me.

544
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,600
I'm here to atone for my mistake.

545
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,560
What mistake?

546
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,077
The beds used for technique class
and ordinary tables and chairs

547
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,360
are in the warehouse.

548
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,000
Today, I'll return

549
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,240
all of them.

550
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,440
Professor Ren,

551
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,077
I, Liu Zi Hong,
will work as a free labourer

552
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,197
and report for duty

553
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,120
with your possessions.

554
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,157
I shall obey

555
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,160
your every instruction.

556
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,280
Young Master.

557
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,037
Since you're flexible,
you'll be in charge

558
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,757
of cleaning the spots

559
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,280
-where normal people can't.
-That's right.

560
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,040
Don't think of leaving the place
before everything is done.

561
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,680
Guys,

562
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:29,880
time to get to work!

563
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,677
I thought you said

564
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,917
you were going to perform well today?

565
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,840
Look at you slacking off again.

566
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,480
I'm doing something
a class leader should do.

567
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,797
Look, everyone in the group

568
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,920
knows it by now.

569
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,160
This has to be measured in accordance
with the volume of water. Can you do it?

570
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,677
That's why I'm here,

571
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,720
student of science.

572
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,277
Alright.

573
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,280
I'll teach you.

574
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,120
Young Master,

575
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,080
didn't you say that
you have a flexible body?

576
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,680
Can you just do your part cleanly?

577
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,557
Ren Tian Zhen, can you support
the ladder for real?

578
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,677
I'm scared.

579
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,557
Don't worry.

580
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,957
I'm supporting it with my strength.

581
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,600
Hold tight.

582
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,240
This isn't the right time
for me to come.

583
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,877
Tou Tou, pass me the cloth.

584
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:43,960
I'll rinse it for you.

585
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,037
I dare not do so.

586
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,077
Your hands are too precious for it.

587
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,040
Just rest.

588
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,360
Mr Ren said

589
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,000
we must attend to everything ourselves.

590
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,640
Do not fail to commit an act of kindness
just because it is small in scale.

591
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,480
Come on.

592
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,760
I was just being courteous.

593
00:24:07,859 --> 00:24:09,880
But why?
I need to keep my promise anyway.

594
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,920
Hurry up.

595
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,957
Can you wipe other areas too?

596
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,440
Look at your right.

597
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,960
-Right.
-Be gentle.

598
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,120
Left.

599
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,760
The left is pretty clean.

600
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,720
Meng Meng,

601
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,720
what's the matter?

602
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,720
Meng Meng,

603
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,120
you look like you're in a bad mood.

604
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,197
Why don't you return to
the medical centre

605
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,000
and play with Jian Xi?

606
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,320
It's fine. I won't cause you
any trouble.

607
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,040
That's not what I meant.

608
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,040
What about this?

609
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,157
You can join Mum
in helping the movers

610
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,480
to arrange the beds we need
for the technique class.

611
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,600
What do you think?

612
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,400
Go now.

613
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,920
Mum is over there.

614
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,120
Go and find her.

615
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,360
You're slacking off again.

616
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,680
I...

617
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,757
If I don't keep an eye on you,

618
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,797
you'll start

619
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,120
to slack off.

620
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,280
You injured me. I can't clean it now.

621
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,677
Why are you saying?

622
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,000
Hurry up. Continue.

623
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,077
You'd better clean them well

624
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,280
or else we have to clean them again.

625
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,440
Fine.

626
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,680
They're so slow.

627
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,080
Change your direction.

628
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,037
What direction?

629
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,080
Isn't this...

630
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,520
Enough.

631
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,280
Why are you playing with this too?

632
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,200
I'm a woman too.

633
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,040
You're different from the rest.

634
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:01,800
How am I

635
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,877
different from the rest?

636
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,360
I want to be like them.

637
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,517
I'm afraid of ageing too.

638
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,240
I wish to be beautiful too.

639
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,880
However, you don't mind at all.

640
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,920
To me...

641
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,360
So, to you,

642
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,720
what kind of person am I?

643
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,840
I'll be frank here.

644
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,360
To me,

645
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,880
beauty

646
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,320
isn't your forte.

647
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,117
I met Mr Tu today.

648
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,480
Mr Tu mentioned his daughter.

649
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,520
Ming Meng. Do you remember her?

650
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,520
She got into the postgraduate program

651
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,160
in our city.

652
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:49,440
Ming Meng?

653
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:51,957
I have a good impression

654
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,600
of that lass.

655
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,280
She was well-mannered

656
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,880
and well-educated.

657
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,120
She's a great fit for Tian Zhen.

658
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,040
Ask her if she has a boyfriend.

659
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,960
Do you think I look like
that kind of person?

660
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,157
But Mr Tu did ask me

661
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,160
if Tian Zhen had any girlfriends.

662
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,160
Actually, he wants me

663
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,520
to create a chance for them

664
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,240
so that they can

665
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,080
return to being childhood friends.

666
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,560
You see?

667
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,400
This is what we call
a match made in heaven.

668
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,960
How did you answer him?

669
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,440
I brushed it off with a yawn.

670
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,240
You...

671
00:27:30,886 --> 00:27:33,120
I told him I was never
concerned about the child.

672
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:36,840
As for you,

673
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,360
do you think your son will obey you

674
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,720
when it comes to finding a girlfriend?

675
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,720
It's not like

676
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,600
he must obey me.

677
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,640
I'm just worried about him.

678
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,040
Our son

679
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,277
is too innocent.

680
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,760
I'm just afraid

681
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,317
that he might do something he'll regret

682
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,400
out of impulse.

683
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,520
What if

684
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,157
he spends the rest of
his life unhappily?

685
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,280
If that happens...

686
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,480
I think

687
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,597
Xu Meng

688
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,240
is clinging onto Tian Zhen.

689
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,160
You are

690
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,760
overthinking it.

691
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,437
Everyone is busy

692
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,040
with the opening of
our apprentice class.

693
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,440
They spend their time together

694
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,000
from day until night.

695
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,317
I didn't discover anything strange

696
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,080
between

697
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,480
Tian Zhen and Meng Meng.

698
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,997
Of course you didn't.

699
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:27,880
You don't understand it at all.

700
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,040
I don't understand it?

701
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,160
Tou Tou spends time
with them all day long.

702
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,600
Why didn't you talk about her then?

703
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,640
Tou Tou?

704
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,920
She's just

705
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,280
hopelessly clueless.

706
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,520
What's wrong with you today?

707
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,837
We finally had time for class today.

708
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,277
Why are you sitting here alone?

709
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,157
Do you have a stomach ache?

710
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,160
Do you feel sick?

711
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,760
I'm stretching.

712
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,680
Stretching?

713
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,360
I keep feeling like

714
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,280
Meng Meng is troubled lately.

715
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,640
Did you feel it too?

716
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,480
What can she fret upon?

717
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,240
It's...

718
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,680
I feel like

719
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,237
there's something strange
with her phone.

720
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,120
It's as if there's a bomb in it.

721
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,840
How did you sense that?

722
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,037
She left her phone

723
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,680
in the toilet that day.

724
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,200
After that, I tried to unlock her phone.

725
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,197
I kept trying

726
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,677
to guess her password.

727
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,957
I couldn't unlock it.

728
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,477
I didn't know her password.

729
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,640
When she came in, she...

730
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,640
She stared at me just like that.

731
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,480
She stared at me just like you.

732
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,640
I was terrified.

733
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,157
If you take my phone

734
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,160
and try to unlock it,

735
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,880
I'll do the same thing.

736
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,677
Instead of reflecting upon
your thief-like behaviour,

737
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,720
you're actually criticizing her?

738
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:52,920
Who said I'm a thief?

739
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,240
How could you say that?
You're being unfair here.

740
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,240
I'm just worried about her.

741
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,520
Besides,

742
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,840
I don't need a password
to unlock my phone.

743
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,197
I have nothing to fear.

744
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,437
There's no need for any passwords.

745
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,680
Your phone?

746
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,197
It's either you buy candied hawthorns

747
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,277
or sachima

748
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,597
with your phone.

749
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,600
No one has time for that.

750
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,400
How did you know I was buying sachima?

751
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,960
Did you sneak a peek?

752
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,120
Did you?

753
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,960
If so, how did you know?

754
00:30:26,286 --> 00:30:28,880
The seller said he would deliver it
right after I paid for it.

755
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:30,559
But it hasn't arrived yet.

756
00:30:30,819 --> 00:30:31,699
Let me check.

757
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,677
So, the clueless Tou

758
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,080
can actually detect
other people's emotions now.

759
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,200
Sachima.

760
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,840
Have you improved

761
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,880
after all the training?

762
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,760
Or is it because spring is here?

763
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,557
Everything is coming back to life.

764
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,557
It's mating season

765
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,600
again.

766
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,277
Cut the crap.

767
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,600
I'm busy every day.

768
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,480
I have no time

769
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,280
to think about such things.

770
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,240
Why are you staring at me?

771
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,640
Help me down.

772
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,237
What's wrong?

773
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,120
Can't you be gentle?

774
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,797
Alright. I'll be gentle.

775
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:38,800
Come.

776
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,720
Are you dating Meng Meng?

777
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,640
What?

778
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,320
What's the matter?

779
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,360
I said,

780
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,677
are you dating

781
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,640
Meng Meng?

782
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:56,760
That's none of your business.

783
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,440
Ren Tian Zhen!

784
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,640
Great timing.

785
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,237
Are you okay with having
shrimp dumplings today?

786
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,120
Is ten enough?

787
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,480
Ten?

788
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,240
I'm starving.

789
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,277
-Can we have more?
-Alright. We'll have 15.

790
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,077
There's a shrimp in every dumpling.

791
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,080
I'm sure you'll be full.

792
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,840
By the way, you came home
pretty late recently.

793
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,077
I guess you're busy

794
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,080
now that the apprentice class
has been reopened.

795
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,437
I heard from Tou Tou

796
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,717
that Mr Ren would hold
an open class tomorrow.

797
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,557
Tomorrow's my rest day too.

798
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,437
I want to attend it.

799
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,400
Do you want to join me?

800
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,280
It's okay.

801
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,000
I have something else to do
tomorrow morning.

802
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,240
I can't make it.

803
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,520
You're not attending
the apprentice class?

804
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,880
No.

805
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,037
You see,

806
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,480
I have something important to do.

807
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,360
(What are you guys doing?)

808
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,440
(Show yourselves.)

809
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,720
(This is a group announcement.)

810
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,280
(This is an announcement
of the new apprentice class.)

811
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,157
(On a beautiful day)

812
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,760
(like this,)

813
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,157
(our apprentice class)

814
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,520
(has finally been reopened)

815
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,160
(after many hardships.)

816
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,640
(Our first mission)

817
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,360
(is to do spring cleaning.)

818
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,600
(Please get into your positions)

819
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,960
(and do your jobs.)

820
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,880
(Let us help out)

821
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,120
(our family.)

822
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,800
(Beginning of Summer
means the end of Spring.)

823
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,640
(As the name implies,
it's the beginning of Summer.)

824
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:10,040
(Sunlight, temperature
and rain gradually increase.)

825
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:15,600
(It's the phase where crops
are growing abundantly.)

826
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:23,280
(Beginning of Summer)

827
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,840
Okay.

828
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:40,437
Are you a newcomer?

829
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,360
-Yeah.
-Over here.

830
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,637
Write down your contact number.

831
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:45,600
Write them down.

832
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,440
-Newbie?
-Yeah.

833
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:51,760
Fill up the form.

834
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,400
Madam.

835
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,160
Mr Ren.

836
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,437
Mr Ren, Madam.

837
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,557
Ms Dong.

838
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,560
Where should we put the flowers?

839
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,077
How many times have I told you guys

840
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,600
not to buy this?

841
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,797
Our class just reopened,

842
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,797
yet you're spending so much on it.

843
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,917
I would rather you donate the money

844
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,480
to our class.

845
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,797
We did.

846
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:12,717
We did donate to the class too.

847
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,960
This is something extra.

848
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,877
You said so yourself.

849
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,840
We need to create a good atmosphere
during opening ceremonies.

850
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,157
This is a token of appreciation

851
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,237
from the class leader

852
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,757
and the other students.

853
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,240
We hope that the apprentice class

854
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,717
can be held smoothly.

855
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,680
Alright, I appreciate that.

856
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,080
-Leave it here.
-Okay.

857
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,237
Congratulations.

858
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,077
Congratulations.

859
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,237
Good things come in pairs.

860
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,397
Today's a happy day.

861
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,237
Welcome.

862
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,237
Mr Liu.

863
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,237
May you be blessed with
double happiness.

864
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,160
Dad, I'll make a move first.

865
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,640
Brat!

866
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,680
How could you leave it here?

867
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:40,880
Come.

868
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,840
Thank you for the flowers.

869
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,400
Okay.

870
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,160
How do we use it?

871
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,560
I don't know.
I'm trying to figure it out too.

872
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:50,920
Which side is the head?

873
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,520
Hey, I'll go deaf, you know?

874
00:35:53,786 --> 00:35:54,717
This is fun.

875
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,720
Are they the same?

876
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,240
Come. I'll help you out.

877
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,840
Look. There's an arrow here.

878
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,600
This confetti is nice.

879
00:36:03,684 --> 00:36:04,678
Let me get one.

880
00:36:04,761 --> 00:36:05,877
What are you two doing?

881
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,880
Is there a wedding?

882
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,040
My dear!

883
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,800
What are you doing here?

884
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:12,840
Did you come here alone?

885
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,560
Where's Quan?

886
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:15,997
Hey.

887
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,600
It's been a few days
since we last saw him.

888
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,757
Didn't he go to the medical centre

889
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,920
and attend the apprentice class lately?

890
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,677
Before this, we thought

891
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,997
the apprentice class would be cancelled.

892
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,640
That's why he was
looking for other jobs.

893
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,797
But I thought he would come back
after the apprentice class

894
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,680
has been reopened.

895
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,960
Didn't he tell you anything?

896
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:33,320
Oh yeah. He said

897
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,157
he's not coming as he has something else
to do this morning.

898
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,120
I'm here to help him apply for leave.

899
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,120
How much does this cost?

900
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,760
This is great.

901
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,957
Professor, I checked the place out.

902
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,797
It's much better

903
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,080
than my previous place.

904
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,280
It's pretty good.

905
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,680
It's pretty good.

906
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,720
Professor,

907
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,437
you see,

908
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,000
I'm still passionate
toward Chinese medicine.

909
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,997
Although the process was excruciating,

910
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,280
the end result was fulfilling.

911
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,240
I think I'm one of the contributors

912
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,477
to the reopening

913
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,560
of our apprentice class, right?

914
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,037
I'll definitely invest in you again

915
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,680
if I make a comeback.

916
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,080
Seems like you resolved
your financial crisis.

917
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,557
Later, we have to talk about

918
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,160
how I can make a comeback after this.

919
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,760
Let's drop the topic for now.

920
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,960
This is a gift

921
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,280
for your apprentice class.

922
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,360
Here you go.

923
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,717
Hey.

924
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,520
You should at least check it out.

925
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,077
I dare not accept this.

926
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,480
What? It's gilded.

927
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,357
I got this all the way

928
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,360
from Chokpori.

929
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,677
The Medicine King figure

930
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,320
implies

931
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,197
that we'll ward off any diseases

932
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,320
and stay safe with him around.

933
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,080
If so, I'll thank you on

934
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,437
-everyone's behalf.
-You have to accept it.

935
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,517
-Thank you.
-You have to accept it.

936
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,200
-I'll accept it then.
-Sure.

937
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,080
Master!

938
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,640
Master.

939
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,440
Look who's here.

940
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,837
I made it in time.

941
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:06,320
This is great.

942
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,080
You are?

943
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,480
Don't you recognize me?

944
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,880
I'm Jiang Li.

945
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,797
Please pardon me.

946
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,920
I cannot recognise people well.

947
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,280
I had terminal cancer,

948
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,797
and I only had

949
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,560
three months to live.

950
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:21,880
Professor Ren,

951
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,600
just be honest with me.

952
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,120
People tell me that if TCM practitioners

953
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,520
introduce you

954
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,600
to Western doctors,

955
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,960
that means you're terminally ill.

956
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,237
If Western doctors introduce you

957
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,837
to TCM practitioners,

958
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,560
that means there's no hope.

959
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,120
I'm already prepared.

960
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,560
Look. Even a patient
with terminal cancer

961
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,080
looks healthier than me.

962
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,880
You finally recognised her.

963
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,440
I didn't stay idle
last year.

964
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,560
I've travelled and hiked
all kinds of mountains.

965
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,840
I take tens of thousands of steps
each day.

966
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,640
It's been one year, right?

967
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,440
Have you been to the hospital?

968
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,440
I have.

969
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,120
The cancer is gone.

970
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,000
Misdiagnosis isn't that rare
for Western doctors.

971
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,117
Mind your own business.

972
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,320
-Can you keep quiet?
-You're wrong.

973
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,000
Professor Ren is right.

974
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,360
This is karma.

975
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,360
I recovered

976
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,360
after paying off my debts.

977
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,437
I guess Buddha forgave you then.

978
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,317
Buddha even appeared in my dream

979
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,080
and told me that I'd recovered.

980
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,557
Buddha even told me

981
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,720
to pass a message to you, Professor Ren.

982
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,320
Saving a life...

983
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,600
Is of boundless beneficence.

984
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,880
My husband wrote this.

985
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,400
He is thankful to you.

986
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,960
After my family went hiking together,

987
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,877
the health of my son and daughter

988
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,040
improved too.

989
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,960
And, our bonds

990
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,920
are stronger than ever.

991
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,597
Professor Ren,

992
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,320
it's all thanks to you.

993
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,760
Excellent writings.

994
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:04,957
Later,

995
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,640
you guys can hang it here.

996
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,437
When people come in,

997
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,637
they can see it immediately.

998
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,440
Isn't it great?
It's your signboard now.

999
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,713
It's our signboard!

1000
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,760
Yes.

1001
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,240
I'm elated today.

1002
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,480
I wish to thank our kind sponsors,

1003
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,920
my master,

1004
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,800
his wife,

1005
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,000
and

1006
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,320
everyone's favourite teacher,

1007
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,640
Ms Song.

1008
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:40,600
I would like to thank
all of you as well.

1009
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,200
Today's the reopening

1010
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,280
of our apprentice class.

1011
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,520
There's another occasion
worth celebrating today.

1012
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,520
I met an old patient of mine,

1013
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,320
which is Madam Jiang Li.

1014
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,720
Now,
I would like to invite her

1015
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,040
to give us

1016
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,520
an opening speech.

1017
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,320
Everyone, give her a big hand.

1018
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,000
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

1019
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,240
(are referenced from relevant
traditional Chinese medicine books)

00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,840
