00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:09,200
Mum,

2
00:00:09,641 --> 00:00:11,438
the TCM forum will be held

3
00:00:11,521 --> 00:00:13,561
on the Dragon Boat Festival.

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,841
Why don't you and Dad stay at home?

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,601
We can meet up next time.

6
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,880
♫ Heavens above ♫

7
00:01:13,321 --> 00:01:15,281
♫ Who can rival me? ♫

8
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,800
♫ With Qingfeng Sword in my hand ♫

9
00:01:18,041 --> 00:01:20,440
♫ Who else can slay
a dragon with one hand? ♫

10
00:01:20,641 --> 00:01:21,681
Nice!

11
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,601
Very nice!

12
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,800
Please.

13
00:01:33,641 --> 00:01:36,001
Heroine, sing us another song.

14
00:01:37,081 --> 00:01:38,081
Let me clap for you.

15
00:01:39,921 --> 00:01:40,921
Please.

16
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,440
Okay.

17
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,521
♫ Heavens above ♫

18
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:19,600
♫ Who can rival me? ♫

19
00:02:21,721 --> 00:02:22,718
♫ With Qingfeng Sword in my hand ♫

20
00:02:22,801 --> 00:02:24,960
♫ Who else can slay
a dragon with one hand? ♫

21
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,641
Mum, what's wrong?

22
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,840
What's going on?

23
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,120
It's nothing.

24
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,755
The medicinal brew just dried up.

25
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,538
The medicinal brew dried up?

26
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,877
I thought Tou Tou was supposed
to keep an eye on it?

27
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,001
Come out.

28
00:02:56,521 --> 00:02:57,521
Meng Meng!

29
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,040
Meng Meng!

30
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,918
Meng Meng.

31
00:03:04,001 --> 00:03:05,480
I'm here for you. Don't be scared.

32
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,840
Everything's fine.

33
00:03:15,441 --> 00:03:17,397
Did you guys tell her
to keep an eye on the brew?

34
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,161
She wanted to do it of her own accord.

35
00:03:19,641 --> 00:03:21,721
She was doing great
for the past few days.

36
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:23,441
Doing great?

37
00:03:24,001 --> 00:03:25,654
A fire almost happened because of her.

38
00:03:26,441 --> 00:03:27,441
Where is she?

39
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:31,001
Tian Zhen.

40
00:03:32,721 --> 00:03:33,801
Is Tou Tou sleeping?

41
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:35,499
Tell her to come downstairs.

42
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,918
She's not in the room.

43
00:03:39,001 --> 00:03:40,521
-She's not around?
-Call her.

44
00:03:42,441 --> 00:03:43,358
Maybe she went loitering...

45
00:03:43,441 --> 00:03:44,441
Call her.

46
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,560
That must be Tou Tou.

47
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,519
Hello. We're the management team.

48
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,558
The smoke alarm was sounded.

49
00:03:56,641 --> 00:03:57,641
Did something happen?

50
00:03:58,028 --> 00:03:59,757
It's nothing. We already
dealt with the issue.

51
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,558
Thank you for coming.

52
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:01,597
We have to inspect the scene

53
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,115
to prevent any potential hazards.

54
00:04:04,721 --> 00:04:05,804
Please come in then.

55
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,280
Sun Tou Tou, where are you?

56
00:04:22,561 --> 00:04:23,357
Hello.

57
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,484
I'm not the phone owner.

58
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,160
Who are you then?

59
00:04:27,641 --> 00:04:28,685
Where's the phone owner?

60
00:04:29,361 --> 00:04:31,144
I'm a security guard of Danguiyuan Villa.

61
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,000
I was patrolling the nearby area

62
00:04:33,361 --> 00:04:34,278
when I saw this phone ringing.

63
00:04:34,361 --> 00:04:35,448
That's why I answered it.

64
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,440
The phone owner is...

65
00:04:38,801 --> 00:04:39,838
I didn't see her.

66
00:04:39,921 --> 00:04:40,961
There's no one here.

67
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,440
There's no one there?

68
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,447
This is bad. She might have
jumped into the lake.

69
00:04:55,081 --> 00:04:56,720
I found her socks here.

70
00:04:57,921 --> 00:04:59,158
I tried to scoop the lake,

71
00:04:59,241 --> 00:05:00,241
but I found nothing.

72
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,361
How deep is this lake?

73
00:05:05,554 --> 00:05:06,753
It's not that deep.

74
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,465
It's not even two meters deep.

75
00:05:08,961 --> 00:05:10,961
But someone drowned here last year.

76
00:05:13,081 --> 00:05:14,361
Is she drunk?

77
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:16,838
I found several empty beer bottles there.

78
00:05:16,921 --> 00:05:17,921
I'm sure she's drunk.

79
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:23,241
Let's find her first.

80
00:05:25,521 --> 00:05:26,521
Tian Zhen,

81
00:05:26,921 --> 00:05:27,921
you know how to swim.

82
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,625
Search for her under the lake.

83
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,517
Okay.

84
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,121
I'll check over there then.

85
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,200
Tian Zhen, be careful.

86
00:05:57,361 --> 00:05:58,361
Tian Zhen, be careful.

87
00:05:59,801 --> 00:06:01,149
Make sure your steps are solid.

88
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,438
I found her!

89
00:06:07,521 --> 00:06:08,521
Dad, I found her!

90
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,320
I found her!

91
00:06:10,681 --> 00:06:11,681
Mum!

92
00:06:17,641 --> 00:06:18,641
You want to take

93
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:20,443
a person like her to the TCM forum?

94
00:06:20,641 --> 00:06:21,880
Do you want everyone

95
00:06:22,121 --> 00:06:23,401
to laugh at us?

96
00:06:23,521 --> 00:06:25,043
You're taking her to the TCM forum?

97
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,200
Are you asking me?

98
00:06:28,241 --> 00:06:29,589
Didn't you read the group chat?

99
00:06:30,961 --> 00:06:32,600
The name list is inside.

100
00:06:32,801 --> 00:06:33,932
Your name is included too.

101
00:06:35,401 --> 00:06:36,440
Can I skip it?

102
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,717
Someone needs to take care of Meng Meng.

103
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,598
No.

104
00:06:38,681 --> 00:06:39,838
This is a valuable chance
for you to learn something.

105
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:41,278
We should let my seniors

106
00:06:41,361 --> 00:06:42,561
join the forum instead.

107
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,797
I have plenty of chances in the future.

108
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,838
No.

109
00:06:44,921 --> 00:06:45,921
You have to go.

110
00:06:46,121 --> 00:06:47,440
But why?

111
00:06:48,081 --> 00:06:50,117
Your great-uncle is the president
of the forum this year.

112
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,480
He designated you to go.

113
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,480
Fine then.

114
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,558
Great-uncle is amazing indeed.

115
00:06:55,641 --> 00:06:57,038
No one can defy the words of a fellow.

116
00:06:57,121 --> 00:06:58,904
However, I have to take
Meng Meng with me.

117
00:07:00,121 --> 00:07:01,165
You're taking her along?

118
00:07:02,361 --> 00:07:03,344
That won't do.

119
00:07:03,427 --> 00:07:06,318
We've already told the organisers
about the number of people we'll bring.

120
00:07:06,401 --> 00:07:08,097
We cannot add or subtract them at will.

121
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,200
Mum,

122
00:07:09,361 --> 00:07:10,438
what if Meng Meng wakes up

123
00:07:10,521 --> 00:07:12,117
and causes a ruckus in the middle
of the night after my departure?

124
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,280
Will you coax her then?

125
00:07:18,641 --> 00:07:19,641
What should we do then?

126
00:07:20,943 --> 00:07:21,943
Why don't we

127
00:07:22,361 --> 00:07:23,681
tell Meng Meng's mother

128
00:07:23,886 --> 00:07:24,926
to take her home?

129
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,301
I'll discuss it with Li Quan.

130
00:07:28,401 --> 00:07:29,401
He can stay.

131
00:07:29,961 --> 00:07:30,917
We're very close to each other.

132
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,348
I'm sure he'll be fine with it.

133
00:07:34,038 --> 00:07:35,908
Check on Tou Tou when
you go upstairs later.

134
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:37,200
She just threw up.

135
00:07:37,961 --> 00:07:40,353
Make sure she doesn't have
anything stuck in her throat.

136
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,480
I'll go.

137
00:07:41,801 --> 00:07:43,801
I'm not sleeping tonight.
I'll look after them.

138
00:07:56,535 --> 00:07:58,438
Mum, we can talk tomorrow.

139
00:07:58,521 --> 00:07:59,517
You've been busy all night.

140
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,600
Get back to sleep.

141
00:08:04,081 --> 00:08:05,521
Where did you go tonight?

142
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,801
I didn't go anywhere.

143
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:10,121
Look into my eyes.

144
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,241
You went drinking with Sun Tou Tou, huh?

145
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,440
Nope.

146
00:08:22,081 --> 00:08:23,081
Really?

147
00:08:32,761 --> 00:08:35,640
You're lucky that
nothing happened to her today.

148
00:08:36,881 --> 00:08:38,273
If something does happen to her,

149
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,640
we'll be

150
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,080
imprisoned for it.

151
00:08:51,361 --> 00:08:52,840
I know you don't like her.

152
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,825
Even so, you mustn't harm her.

153
00:08:55,881 --> 00:08:57,921
You need to keep your conscience clear.

154
00:08:58,761 --> 00:09:00,158
Mum, we just had a few drinks.

155
00:09:00,241 --> 00:09:02,121
I never expected her
to fall into the lake.

156
00:09:04,201 --> 00:09:06,278
Now, you're so close to her
that you can drink together with her

157
00:09:06,361 --> 00:09:08,241
and call her your buddy, huh?

158
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,640
Tian Zhen, listen carefully.

159
00:09:13,201 --> 00:09:15,557
Whether Sun Tou Tou
can stay in this family or not

160
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,718
depends on

161
00:09:16,801 --> 00:09:18,561
her performance.

162
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,214
But it's different for you.

163
00:09:21,201 --> 00:09:23,640
You have to establish
your own family in the future.

164
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,197
If your father hears about this,

165
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,541
he'll chase you out of the family
before Sun Tou Tou.

166
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,640
If you don't adjust your state of mind

167
00:09:34,881 --> 00:09:36,280
and co-exist with her,

168
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,943
I may not be able to
defend you next time.

169
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,799
Mum,

170
00:09:44,882 --> 00:09:46,077
I know my fault now.

171
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,201
I won't do it again.

172
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,080
Again?

173
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:51,752
What are you smiling at?

174
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,600
Mum, I won't do it again.

175
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,160
Stay away from her.

176
00:10:05,561 --> 00:10:06,881
And, stay away

177
00:10:07,761 --> 00:10:09,160
from that girl as well.

178
00:10:10,201 --> 00:10:12,201
This is a serious warning.

179
00:10:24,761 --> 00:10:25,761
Mum, what do you want?

180
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,637
Tend to your own needs.

181
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,720
Come.

182
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,160
Tian Zhen.

183
00:10:32,881 --> 00:10:33,881
Have a herbal tea egg.

184
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:36,241
I feel like I'm dying.

185
00:10:39,001 --> 00:10:40,001
This feels terrible.

186
00:10:41,321 --> 00:10:42,757
I'm going to die.

187
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,877
What nonsense are you uttering
this early in the morning?

188
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,997
I feel terrible.

189
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,689
I feel cold and hot at the same time.

190
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,881
Your pulse is tender and weak.

191
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,874
Seems like you need to
take Chinese medicine.

192
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,839
No way.

193
00:11:01,922 --> 00:11:03,561
I'll be fine after a few days.

194
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,720
I'm going to sleep.

195
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,400
Finish the hot congee.

196
00:11:12,761 --> 00:11:13,761
Avoid other food.

197
00:11:15,321 --> 00:11:16,557
Must I have it by itself?

198
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,160
-Yes.
-Without anything else?

199
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:19,761
But...

200
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,907
Who did you drink
together with last night?

201
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,160
I

202
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,976
drank alone.

203
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,080
You finished eight bottles of beer

204
00:11:48,761 --> 00:11:50,881
and an entire bottle of Shaoxing wine?

205
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,520
Shaoxing wine?

206
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,960
Wait.

207
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,918
You said this yourself.

208
00:11:59,001 --> 00:12:00,757
To invite the moon I raise my cup.

209
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,637
We're three, as my shadow shows up.

210
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,557
I just wanted to see

211
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,678
how it became three people.

212
00:12:07,761 --> 00:12:09,321
I was just curious about that.

213
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,361
I was just wondering

214
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,197
how it became three people.

215
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,881
It was pretty strange to me.

216
00:12:16,201 --> 00:12:17,441
You drank

217
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,101
all those liquor by yourself?

218
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,080
Everybody knows that
I can hold my liquor well.

219
00:12:24,241 --> 00:12:26,678
I got drunk because I consumed
different types of alcohol.

220
00:12:26,761 --> 00:12:29,637
If you mix beer with rice wine, it'll...

221
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,720
Tou Tou,

222
00:12:31,201 --> 00:12:33,400
you mustn't lie in front of Master.

223
00:12:36,441 --> 00:12:37,720
You must be honest.

224
00:12:38,881 --> 00:12:40,718
If I discover that you're lying,

225
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,160
I'll punish you severely.

226
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,025
Are you going to chase me out?

227
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,361
I will face the music alone.

228
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,201
I drank by myself.

229
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,280
It has nothing to do with other people.

230
00:13:09,441 --> 00:13:10,441
Do not do it again.

231
00:13:12,321 --> 00:13:14,626
Copy Virtue of A Great Physician
for the entire month.

232
00:13:16,881 --> 00:13:20,400
You wanted to tend to
Meng Meng's medicine yourself.

233
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,206
In the end, you failed your mission.

234
00:13:22,441 --> 00:13:23,918
Not only did you break your promise
and behave irresponsibly,

235
00:13:24,001 --> 00:13:26,321
but you also wasted Meng Meng's medicine.

236
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,134
Meng Meng hasn't even taken
her medicine yet today.

237
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,640
Meng Meng,

238
00:13:32,761 --> 00:13:33,761
I'm sorry.

239
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,201
Last night was an accident.

240
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,718
It definitely won't happen again.

241
00:13:38,801 --> 00:13:40,678
Look at me.

242
00:13:40,761 --> 00:13:41,997
I've suffered my retribution.

243
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,441
Will you please forgive me?

244
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,001
Meng Meng forgave me.

245
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,564
I can't take it anymore.

246
00:13:50,561 --> 00:13:51,801
Can I take a nap?

247
00:13:52,001 --> 00:13:53,001
Show me your hand.

248
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,317
Measure your right pulse
with your left hand.

249
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,238
Nephew,

250
00:13:58,321 --> 00:13:59,321
do you know

251
00:13:59,761 --> 00:14:00,679
what situation we're in?

252
00:14:00,762 --> 00:14:03,400
You're still trying to train me here?

253
00:14:04,561 --> 00:14:06,561
-Goodness.
-Practice makes perfect.

254
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,574
Rome wasn't built in a day.

255
00:14:08,761 --> 00:14:11,201
Feel your beating pulse.

256
00:14:11,561 --> 00:14:12,692
Did you detect any changes

257
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,080
besides the beating?

258
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,877
Wait.

259
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,520
It isn't beating anymore.

260
00:14:25,321 --> 00:14:26,321
Wait!

261
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,480
Why isn't it beating anymore?

262
00:14:28,761 --> 00:14:29,838
What's going on?

263
00:14:29,921 --> 00:14:31,118
Examine me!

264
00:14:31,201 --> 00:14:31,998
Examine me!

265
00:14:32,081 --> 00:14:34,201
Am I dying?

266
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,520
-Here.
-Niece-in-law!

267
00:14:35,681 --> 00:14:36,598
Finish this.

268
00:14:36,681 --> 00:14:37,761
What is this?

269
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,321
Examine my pulse!

270
00:14:39,881 --> 00:14:41,640
Finish the Fukangling.

271
00:14:42,761 --> 00:14:43,761
Take it while it's hot.

272
00:14:46,201 --> 00:14:47,201
This is amulet water?

273
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,118
Will I die?

274
00:14:50,201 --> 00:14:52,080
Must I take amulet water now?

275
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,520
It's not amulet water.

276
00:14:53,881 --> 00:14:54,881
It's a health drink.

277
00:14:56,321 --> 00:14:58,080
What exactly is it?

278
00:14:59,201 --> 00:15:00,361
It's spicy hot pot soup.

279
00:15:03,561 --> 00:15:04,438
That's impossible.

280
00:15:04,521 --> 00:15:05,561
You lied to me.

281
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,997
It doesn't taste like hot pot at all.

282
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,733
It tastes like Chinese medicine to me.

283
00:15:08,881 --> 00:15:11,997
It's made with medicinal ingredients
you can find in the kitchen.

284
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,437
For example, dried ginger,
dried orange peel,

285
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,561
red dates, and so on.

286
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,678
It dispels coldness.

287
00:15:17,761 --> 00:15:19,480
You got drunk last night.

288
00:15:20,441 --> 00:15:21,920
Your spleen and stomach are heaty.

289
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,238
Your body was heaty too.

290
00:15:23,321 --> 00:15:24,640
When you jumped into the lake,

291
00:15:25,761 --> 00:15:27,001
the water was cold.

292
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,720
Coldness is born below the feet.

293
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,197
Heat and coldness started
fighting in your middle energizer,

294
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,478
which consists of your spleen

295
00:15:33,561 --> 00:15:34,561
and stomach.

296
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,640
Essentially, it's your stomach.

297
00:15:37,201 --> 00:15:38,119
Actually, your body

298
00:15:38,202 --> 00:15:40,001
was expelling sweat automatically.

299
00:15:40,441 --> 00:15:42,317
It's stated clearly within
Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic,

300
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,881
Discourse on Heat.

301
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,160
Now, as for heat diseases,

302
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,201
they all are of the type
"harm caused by cold".

303
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,718
No matter if your body is heaty

304
00:15:51,801 --> 00:15:53,520
or if you have diarrhoea,

305
00:15:53,881 --> 00:15:56,080
as long as it's not food poisoning,

306
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,520
it's mostly caused by coldness.

307
00:15:59,321 --> 00:16:00,960
Let me give you an example.

308
00:16:01,321 --> 00:16:02,877
For example, the doors
and windows in our house

309
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,918
are closed.

310
00:16:04,001 --> 00:16:05,520
Nothing can get out of the house.

311
00:16:05,778 --> 00:16:06,778
What should we do then?

312
00:16:06,881 --> 00:16:08,201
I'll open a window.

313
00:16:09,321 --> 00:16:12,080
We can take pungent
and warm-natured drugs

314
00:16:12,321 --> 00:16:15,640
so that our body will expel
the coldness automatically.

315
00:16:16,201 --> 00:16:17,593
Our bodies will recover by then.

316
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,520
You said this too.

317
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:24,184
When joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure
have not yet arisen,

318
00:16:24,267 --> 00:16:25,451
it is called "moderate".

319
00:16:25,561 --> 00:16:28,840
When they arise to their appropriate
levels, it is called "harmony".

320
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:32,077
That means if we stick to a diet

321
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,317
and adopt a healthy lifestyle,

322
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,239
we won't

323
00:16:34,322 --> 00:16:35,400
fall sick.

324
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,757
If we do fall sick,

325
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,997
we just need to overcompensate for it.

326
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:38,798
This way,

327
00:16:38,881 --> 00:16:40,229
we'll recover from our illness.

328
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:42,045
Was that what you meant?

329
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:43,881
Yes. Finish it while it's hot.

330
00:16:54,001 --> 00:16:55,520
No, I need to take a nap.

331
00:17:01,881 --> 00:17:03,360
You don't even let me take Shumai.

332
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,081
She's a promising student.

333
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,152
Look at your so-called good son!

334
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,880
Who said girls were inferior to guys?

335
00:17:29,321 --> 00:17:30,998
I will hand over my position
as the leader of the sect

336
00:17:31,081 --> 00:17:32,168
to Tou Tou in the future.

337
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,441
Look at that son of yours.

338
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,238
No matter if it's courage or knowledge,

339
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:37,721
he's no match

340
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,358
for a parent less child

341
00:17:39,441 --> 00:17:40,801
who wasn't even educated.

342
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,561
He's not ready at all!

343
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,878
You want me to chase Tou Tou
out of the house?

344
00:17:47,961 --> 00:17:48,961
In your dreams.

345
00:17:51,201 --> 00:17:52,561
If he does this again,

346
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,518
I'll chase him out

347
00:17:53,601 --> 00:17:54,601
without any mercy!

348
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,760
What a shame.

349
00:18:34,441 --> 00:18:36,760
The 30-year-old Nu Er Hong wine
had gone to waste.

350
00:18:38,561 --> 00:18:40,120
It would've been nourishing

351
00:18:40,921 --> 00:18:43,081
for the little girl

352
00:18:43,441 --> 00:18:45,201
if she took it moderately.

353
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,437
If my foolish grandson

354
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,520
was out to harm her,

355
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,758
he didn't need to resort to
using such valuable liquor.

356
00:18:51,841 --> 00:18:52,998
He could've gotten a random
bottle of liquor

357
00:18:53,081 --> 00:18:54,601
downstairs.

358
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,760
I'm being harsh again.

359
00:19:01,197 --> 00:19:02,448
I will reflect upon my actions.

360
00:19:02,531 --> 00:19:03,879
I will reflect upon my actions.

361
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,026
(Qibo Medical Centre)

362
00:19:24,561 --> 00:19:25,598
Mr Wu, you're here?

363
00:19:25,681 --> 00:19:26,718
We're on our lunch break now.

364
00:19:26,801 --> 00:19:27,957
It's fine. I'm looking for Xin Zheng.

365
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:28,918
He's preparing prescriptions at the back.

366
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,160
Okay. I'll wait for him.

367
00:19:30,321 --> 00:19:31,321
Okay.

368
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,120
Hubby, is this the place?

369
00:19:34,681 --> 00:19:35,899
Look at this medical centre.

370
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,880
It's so high-class.

371
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,640
Quan is working here.

372
00:19:40,921 --> 00:19:41,921
This is great.

373
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,160
Mr Wu?

374
00:19:43,321 --> 00:19:44,721
-You're here.
-Are you busy?

375
00:19:45,561 --> 00:19:47,077
-Resume your work.
-Let me get you a drink.

376
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,552
It's fine. I can do that myself.

377
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:51,197
Are you two here to get a diagnosis?

378
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,797
Or are you guys to seek other treatments?

379
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,598
We're not here to seek physicians.

380
00:19:53,681 --> 00:19:54,437
We're looking for someone.

381
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,520
He's working here.

382
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,797
-Who are you guys looking for then?
-Dad? Mum?

383
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,880
Quan.

384
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,598
-Son.
-What are you two doing here?

385
00:20:02,681 --> 00:20:03,961
We're here to visit you.

386
00:20:05,201 --> 00:20:06,481
This place is great.

387
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,040
This is great.

388
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,152
The environment here is so nice.

389
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,640
Mr Wu,

390
00:20:11,921 --> 00:20:13,000
thank you

391
00:20:13,201 --> 00:20:14,921
for helping Quan to get a job.

392
00:20:15,801 --> 00:20:17,520
Thank you so much.

393
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,797
His father and I

394
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,719
are uneducated.

395
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:21,063
We don't have any skills too.

396
00:20:21,321 --> 00:20:23,797
We'll depend on him
to provide for the family in the future.

397
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,077
-Your kid is pretty good.
-Thank you.

398
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,721
Thank you for your help.

399
00:20:26,961 --> 00:20:28,077
What are you doing?

400
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,321
You must accept this.

401
00:20:31,321 --> 00:20:32,838
This is for Professor Ren.

402
00:20:32,921 --> 00:20:33,921
This is for you.

403
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,957
One of you helped our child

404
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:36,918
to get a job

405
00:20:37,001 --> 00:20:38,801
while the other is our child's superior.

406
00:20:38,961 --> 00:20:40,317
Both of you are our benefactors.

407
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,400
Have a seat.

408
00:20:42,681 --> 00:20:43,599
We were just

409
00:20:43,682 --> 00:20:44,801
fated to meet.

410
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,197
I cannot accept your gifts.

411
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,358
No. Mr Wu,

412
00:20:48,441 --> 00:20:49,797
you have to accept this.

413
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,801
This is just a token of our appreciation.

414
00:20:51,921 --> 00:20:54,921
To you, it might be just
lifting a finger.

415
00:20:55,081 --> 00:20:56,317
However, to our family,

416
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,760
it's a debt of gratitude
that we can never repay.

417
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,601
Our village chief said

418
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,934
the household register here

419
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,321
is worth

420
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,160
several million yuan.

421
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,238
-Household register?
-That's right.

422
00:21:08,321 --> 00:21:11,321
We're very thankful that
the medical centre could help Quan

423
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,282
to set his household register here.

424
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,760
What about this?

425
00:21:27,801 --> 00:21:28,838
I'll accept your gifts

426
00:21:28,921 --> 00:21:31,081
this time.

427
00:21:31,921 --> 00:21:34,160
But you must never bring them again,

428
00:21:34,441 --> 00:21:35,441
okay?

429
00:21:35,801 --> 00:21:36,801
It's a promise.

430
00:21:37,969 --> 00:21:38,969
Li Quan,

431
00:21:39,561 --> 00:21:41,040
youngsters like you all

432
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,520
are the future of the TCM industry.

433
00:21:44,441 --> 00:21:45,801
You have to work hard,

434
00:21:46,262 --> 00:21:47,262
understood?

435
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,237
It's rare for your parents
to visit Jiangzhou.

436
00:21:50,321 --> 00:21:52,040
You should take them around.

437
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,238
-Okay.
-Please visit the city.

438
00:21:55,321 --> 00:21:56,321
Thank you.

439
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,020
Don't worry. Your child
is under my care.

440
00:21:59,561 --> 00:22:01,040
Okay. Thank you.

441
00:22:12,721 --> 00:22:14,156
You should break the news to him.

442
00:22:14,441 --> 00:22:15,838
You should do it.

443
00:22:15,921 --> 00:22:17,197
How can I do it?

444
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,280
This matter is too...

445
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,718
He's our son. What are you afraid of?

446
00:22:19,801 --> 00:22:20,801
What am I afraid of?

447
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:21,998
Look at what you're saying.

448
00:22:22,081 --> 00:22:23,081
Mum,

449
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,238
I thought I told you guys not to come?

450
00:22:25,321 --> 00:22:26,998
Why did you guys appear out of the blue?

451
00:22:27,081 --> 00:22:28,957
You said you'd be busy
during the Dragon Boat Festival, right?

452
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,000
That's why we came here earlier.

453
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,358
Okay then.

454
00:22:32,441 --> 00:22:33,638
You and Dad can wait here.

455
00:22:33,721 --> 00:22:35,118
I'll get changed and take you guys out.

456
00:22:35,201 --> 00:22:36,201
No need for that.

457
00:22:36,561 --> 00:22:38,040
You don't need to keep us company.

458
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,943
We'll leave after delivering our message.

459
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,640
Please go ahead.

460
00:22:44,081 --> 00:22:45,081
Quan,

461
00:22:45,921 --> 00:22:47,240
tell me something.

462
00:22:47,561 --> 00:22:50,481
How much do you earn per month?

463
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,077
Mum,

464
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,508
I started working not long ago.

465
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,760
I don't earn that much.

466
00:22:57,201 --> 00:22:58,984
That's why I don't have a lot of savings.

467
00:23:00,321 --> 00:23:01,321
Yeah, I guess so.

468
00:23:03,321 --> 00:23:04,321
Mum, what's the matter?

469
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,783
Just tell me if you're having any issues.

470
00:23:06,961 --> 00:23:08,797
You're talking to your own child,
you know?

471
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,681
There's no need to beat around the bush.

472
00:23:10,801 --> 00:23:13,236
Just break the news to him.
There's no need to be scared.

473
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,321
Do you have 20,000 yuan on you?

474
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,601
I plan

475
00:23:19,921 --> 00:23:21,530
to breed some lobster fry in our pond

476
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,674
so that we can make some money
during winter.

477
00:23:24,784 --> 00:23:25,784
Quan,

478
00:23:25,961 --> 00:23:26,961
it's like this.

479
00:23:27,561 --> 00:23:29,077
There was a cold spell
during late spring.

480
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,118
Half of our fry were dead.

481
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:32,723
Our investment went down the drain.

482
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,718
Your younger brother will be attending

483
00:23:34,801 --> 00:23:36,601
junior high this year.

484
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,321
We need to support him too.

485
00:23:39,961 --> 00:23:40,961
Mum,

486
00:23:41,681 --> 00:23:42,681
I understand now.

487
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,280
Dad,

488
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,478
I'll save up all the money I earn

489
00:23:46,561 --> 00:23:47,605
and send it back to you.

490
00:23:48,441 --> 00:23:49,441
Wait, my child.

491
00:23:50,321 --> 00:23:51,321
You see,

492
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,681
it's quite embarrassing

493
00:23:53,201 --> 00:23:54,240
for us

494
00:23:55,441 --> 00:23:56,789
to ask our child for money too.

495
00:23:57,081 --> 00:23:58,760
But this is a special period.

496
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,280
Just tell me how much cash you have.

497
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,197
We're in no rush.

498
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,585
-That's not true.
-You just need to keep this in mind.

499
00:24:06,148 --> 00:24:06,917
Alright.

500
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,998
You should return to work.

501
00:24:08,081 --> 00:24:09,473
We're just here to check on you.

502
00:24:09,561 --> 00:24:10,557
We'll leave now.

503
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,640
Return to work.

504
00:24:11,801 --> 00:24:12,801
Everything's fine.

505
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,681
Don't apply for leave, okay?

506
00:24:15,681 --> 00:24:16,681
Let's go.

507
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,118
Let's leave now.

508
00:24:18,201 --> 00:24:19,118
-Wait.
-Hurry.

509
00:24:19,201 --> 00:24:19,957
See you.

510
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,197
Don't apply for leave, okay?

511
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,478
If not, they'll deduct your wage.

512
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:24,317
Wait, we should take something
since we're already here.

513
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,520
-Let's go.
-Mum.

514
00:24:25,681 --> 00:24:26,677
Aren't you guys going to
spend the night here?

515
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,561
No. We don't want to waste money.

516
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,557
See you.

517
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,280
-But he...
-Let's go.

518
00:24:31,681 --> 00:24:32,718
-Goodness.
-We should at least get money from him.

519
00:24:32,801 --> 00:24:33,639
What are you saying?

520
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:35,679
We can figure something out
when we head back.

521
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,520
Tian Zhen.

522
00:25:03,921 --> 00:25:05,118
-Which car am I taking?
-Sorry.

523
00:25:05,201 --> 00:25:06,518
I forgot to tell you.

524
00:25:06,601 --> 00:25:07,681
You see, it's like this.

525
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,677
If I go alone,

526
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,599
Meng Meng will be alone.

527
00:25:10,682 --> 00:25:11,987
Everyone will worry about her.

528
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,160
What about this?

529
00:25:13,423 --> 00:25:15,998
We'll have plenty of chances in the
future. You can go next time.

530
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:17,520
I'm truly sorry about this.

531
00:25:17,729 --> 00:25:18,718
I forgot about it.

532
00:25:18,801 --> 00:25:19,961
-Okay.
-Okay?

533
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,400
It's fine.

534
00:25:23,561 --> 00:25:24,758
How is it? Is everyone ready?

535
00:25:24,841 --> 00:25:25,880
Let's depart then.

536
00:25:28,561 --> 00:25:29,561
Li Quan, follow me.

537
00:25:31,561 --> 00:25:32,561
What?

538
00:25:34,321 --> 00:25:35,797
Are you the only one who
can command students now?

539
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,957
I'm the academy's principal.

540
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,345
Can't I get myself a follower?

541
00:25:39,441 --> 00:25:40,441
Come on. Let's go.

542
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,120
Let's go.

543
00:25:44,441 --> 00:25:45,441
Let's go.

544
00:25:59,441 --> 00:26:00,441
Mr Wu,

545
00:26:01,801 --> 00:26:02,801
thank you.

546
00:26:06,801 --> 00:26:07,801
My child,

547
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,040
you remind me

548
00:26:11,441 --> 00:26:13,640
of my younger days.

549
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,686
(30 years ago)

550
00:26:23,028 --> 00:26:23,957
Ling Ian.

551
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,400
Shan Dao, you're here too?

552
00:26:32,695 --> 00:26:33,695
What's the matter?

553
00:26:34,321 --> 00:26:35,321
Take a sniff.

554
00:26:36,801 --> 00:26:38,358
This isn't a herb. These are flowers.

555
00:26:38,441 --> 00:26:39,746
Don't pick them for no reason.

556
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,280
Where are we?

557
00:27:53,961 --> 00:27:55,081
This is someone's house.

558
00:27:55,801 --> 00:27:56,878
The owner of this house

559
00:27:56,961 --> 00:27:59,197
is an entrepreneur

560
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,321
of the TCM industry.

561
00:28:00,561 --> 00:28:02,201
He sponsored many

562
00:28:02,561 --> 00:28:04,280
of the TCM funds.

563
00:28:04,921 --> 00:28:06,838
He also sponsored many students
for their studies.

564
00:28:06,921 --> 00:28:07,719
That's why we decided

565
00:28:07,802 --> 00:28:08,961
to hold the forum here.

566
00:28:09,561 --> 00:28:11,201
Mainly, it's because there's a field

567
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,040
of mugwort behind his house.

568
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,792
The Dragon Goat Festival is a good time
to harvest them.

569
00:28:16,441 --> 00:28:17,437
Look.

570
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,738
There are even pomelo trees.

571
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,520
-Xin Zheng.
-Uncle.

572
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,920
Good.

573
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,280
Hello, Fellow Zhang.

574
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,481
-Hello, Fellow Zhang.
-Hello.

575
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,856
We'll depend on you for today's speech.

576
00:28:36,961 --> 00:28:38,048
No problem, Fellow Zhang.

577
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,157
-I'll head there first.
-Where's Tian Zhen?

578
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,240
Great-uncle.

579
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,558
I brought you some stinky beancurd

580
00:28:42,641 --> 00:28:44,250
and preserved shrimp made by Grandma.

581
00:28:46,001 --> 00:28:46,797
Good.

582
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,478
-Good boy.
-I'll pass them to you later.

583
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:49,561
Okay.

584
00:28:50,441 --> 00:28:51,681
Look at my sister.

585
00:28:51,801 --> 00:28:53,561
She has no regard for my dignity.

586
00:28:55,681 --> 00:28:57,160
But preserved beancurd is great.

587
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,280
I'm sure you guys

588
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,677
enjoyed the scent on your way here.

589
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,077
But it was

590
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,160
pretty terrible.

591
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,197
Xin Zheng,

592
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,481
I heard that you're holding
an apprentice class.

593
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,874
You're doing something noble
without announcing it.

594
00:29:11,957 --> 00:29:12,878
That's great.

595
00:29:12,961 --> 00:29:14,486
It's good for the nation and its people.

596
00:29:14,569 --> 00:29:15,478
Fellow Zhang,

597
00:29:15,561 --> 00:29:16,797
I was planning to tell you that.

598
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,040
This apprentice class, which was my idea,

599
00:29:19,201 --> 00:29:21,277
has been blooming

600
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,921
under Professor Ren's lead.

601
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,280
However,

602
00:29:24,441 --> 00:29:25,797
there are still many obstacles
we need to overcome.

603
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,280
So, Fellow Zhang,

604
00:29:27,441 --> 00:29:28,518
please support us.

605
00:29:28,601 --> 00:29:29,601
Sure.

606
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,961
Aren't you the principal?

607
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,000
So, this is related to you?

608
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,760
Fellow Zhang, you have no idea.

609
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,358
Now, I'm letting Professor Ren

610
00:29:39,441 --> 00:29:41,478
bask in the glory and fame.

611
00:29:41,561 --> 00:29:44,481
As for me, I'm dealing
with all the cumbersome matters.

612
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,681
Good job.

613
00:29:47,961 --> 00:29:48,961
Xin Zheng,

614
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,441
your apprentice class

615
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,040
is under the university, right?

616
00:29:53,801 --> 00:29:55,019
If so, the University of TCM

617
00:29:55,681 --> 00:29:57,247
has a great sense of responsibility.

618
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,640
Indeed.

619
00:29:58,801 --> 00:29:59,921
It's time for us

620
00:30:00,561 --> 00:30:02,040
to reform the education system.

621
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,358
We're returning to the roots
of TCM study, huh?

622
00:30:04,441 --> 00:30:07,481
The apprentice class is
a noble effort indeed.

623
00:30:09,801 --> 00:30:12,197
Chinese civilization has been through
all kinds of hardships.

624
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,441
But it didn't vanish
like the other civilizations.

625
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,813
I'm sure the apprentice classes
had played a major role in it.

626
00:30:18,801 --> 00:30:20,040
Shan Dao did help me a lot

627
00:30:20,536 --> 00:30:22,280
when it came to the apprentice class.

628
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,077
Mr Wu, Professor Ren,

629
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,957
in the future, if you need
any contributions,

630
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,160
I can definitely do my part.

631
00:30:29,801 --> 00:30:31,957
Professor Ren and his wife
saved my life after all.

632
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,160
Without Professor Ren,
I wouldn't be here.

633
00:30:34,681 --> 00:30:36,081
He's mocking me.

634
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,838
Last time, when we were doing
the bloodletting therapy on the plane,

635
00:30:38,921 --> 00:30:39,921
it was hectic.

636
00:30:41,561 --> 00:30:42,961
What does that mean?

637
00:30:43,801 --> 00:30:44,838
Come here.

638
00:30:44,921 --> 00:30:45,921
Come here.

639
00:30:47,441 --> 00:30:48,441
Hurry up.

640
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,640
Hurry.

641
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,760
Greet Fellow Zhang.

642
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,280
Who is this young lady?

643
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,437
She's the successor of
the Jiang family's acupuncture sect,

644
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,640
Sun Tou Tou.

645
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,157
So, she's my junior?

646
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,414
Pardon me for the rudeness.

647
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,601
That was rude of me.

648
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,640
When my father was still around,

649
00:31:11,921 --> 00:31:12,921
I think...

650
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,280
It should be her grandmother.

651
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,359
That's right.

652
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:18,840
Your grandmother

653
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:21,801
and my father
were very close to each other.

654
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,838
What about this?
Later,

655
00:31:26,921 --> 00:31:29,880
I'll have a drink with my junior here.

656
00:31:31,601 --> 00:31:32,599
Of course.

657
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:33,813
I can hold my liquor well.

658
00:31:33,961 --> 00:31:36,000
You're following his cues, huh?

659
00:31:37,801 --> 00:31:38,801
Okay?

660
00:31:39,441 --> 00:31:41,238
Is one bottle enough?
Or do you need more?

661
00:31:41,321 --> 00:31:42,539
I don't think she can drink.

662
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,520
Please.

663
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,841
-Fellow Zhang.
-Hello.

664
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,921
You're here.

665
00:31:53,201 --> 00:31:54,201
Junior.

666
00:31:56,036 --> 00:31:57,961
Over here.
Sit here.

667
00:32:00,215 --> 00:32:01,197
See you.

668
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,280
She's coming.

669
00:32:03,561 --> 00:32:05,400
Come here.
Come.

670
00:32:07,321 --> 00:32:08,321
Tian Zhen.

671
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,160
Great-uncle.

672
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,040
Long time no see, huh?

673
00:32:12,148 --> 00:32:12,957
Yeah.

674
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,598
Your grandmother wanted me to test you.

675
00:32:14,681 --> 00:32:15,598
Great-uncle,

676
00:32:15,681 --> 00:32:16,838
can I just enjoy my meal

677
00:32:16,921 --> 00:32:17,961
without being tested?

678
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,441
I'm nervous now.

679
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,718
Enjoy your meal. I won't test you today.

680
00:32:21,801 --> 00:32:23,478
-What's with the test?
-Yeah.

681
00:32:23,561 --> 00:32:24,681
Come here.

682
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,557
Great-uncle, I have to
take care of this patient.

683
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,998
I can't leave her here alone.

684
00:32:29,081 --> 00:32:30,077
I need to keep her company.

685
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,421
You guys can enjoy your meal.

686
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,681
What patient?

687
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,441
She must be your girlfriend.

688
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,599
-Take her here too.
-That's not it.

689
00:32:39,107 --> 00:32:40,880
Secretary Qian, get us two more chairs.

690
00:32:41,561 --> 00:32:43,718
We need to mingle with youngsters.

691
00:32:43,801 --> 00:32:44,801
That's right.

692
00:32:45,765 --> 00:32:46,765
Master.

693
00:32:47,321 --> 00:32:49,040
I don't think I'll drink today.

694
00:32:49,921 --> 00:32:52,008
I'm the eldest here
if we consider our seniority.

695
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,481
You can choose to drink less
on such occasions.

696
00:32:57,561 --> 00:32:58,517
I won't drink.

697
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,598
I'm not drinking today.

698
00:32:59,681 --> 00:33:01,760
I need to set a good example
for my juniors.

699
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,880
Sit properly.

700
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,280
Thank you.

701
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,227
Peng Shi Yan?

702
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:52,310
Peng Shi Yan.

703
00:33:53,801 --> 00:33:55,358
What are you doing here?

704
00:33:55,441 --> 00:33:57,094
-Why can't I be here?
-What's going on?

705
00:33:57,961 --> 00:33:58,961
Is she your friend?

706
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,040
Dormmate!

707
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,640
What are you doing here?

708
00:34:04,321 --> 00:34:05,317
Wait.

709
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,227
How come the two of you
came here together?

710
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:09,438
She brought me along.

711
00:34:09,521 --> 00:34:10,521
I didn't.

712
00:34:11,441 --> 00:34:12,441
You're something else.

713
00:34:16,921 --> 00:34:17,961
Take me with you.

714
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,198
A spy like me

715
00:34:20,281 --> 00:34:23,238
needs to head to the enemy's nest
to eradicate them once and for all.

716
00:34:23,921 --> 00:34:24,958
Take me with you.

717
00:34:25,041 --> 00:34:25,839
You're a renowned figure.

718
00:34:25,922 --> 00:34:27,575
You need to have a servant beside you.

719
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,360
Besides,

720
00:34:29,761 --> 00:34:31,457
the mountain path is rugged and uneven.

721
00:34:31,961 --> 00:34:33,077
I checked the schedule too.

722
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,717
We have to gather mugwort
before dawn on the second day.

723
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,037
I'm sure you'll depart at night.

724
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,557
What if you encounter a bear

725
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,441
or a robber? It'll be dangerous.

726
00:34:40,281 --> 00:34:41,360
Most importantly,

727
00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:43,914
it's a long journey.

728
00:34:43,997 --> 00:34:46,397
You need a second driver somehow.

729
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,080
Thanks.

730
00:35:13,721 --> 00:35:14,761
Give me some time.

731
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,820
You can drive once I'm done throwing up.

732
00:35:19,201 --> 00:35:20,984
You'll drive once
you're done throwing up.

733
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,160
Why?

734
00:35:25,836 --> 00:35:26,836
I have motion sickness.

735
00:35:27,001 --> 00:35:28,158
You won't get that when you drive.

736
00:35:28,241 --> 00:35:30,080
Only passengers will get that.

737
00:35:31,761 --> 00:35:32,761
I don't know how to.

738
00:35:34,241 --> 00:35:35,441
What do you mean by that?

739
00:35:35,761 --> 00:35:36,892
I don't know how to drive.

740
00:35:37,241 --> 00:35:38,521
You don't know how to drive?

741
00:35:39,375 --> 00:35:40,118
Why did you

742
00:35:40,201 --> 00:35:40,959
tell me that I needed you

743
00:35:41,042 --> 00:35:42,360
as my second driver then?

744
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:45,638
Who opened the bottle cap for you
when you drank water?

745
00:35:45,721 --> 00:35:48,156
Who kept your bottle for you
once you were done drinking?

746
00:35:48,241 --> 00:35:49,676
I did my job as your co-driver...

747
00:36:08,921 --> 00:36:10,269
Why are you leaving without me?

748
00:36:17,281 --> 00:36:18,681
Wait for me!

749
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,120
Wait for me!

750
00:36:24,001 --> 00:36:25,001
I...

751
00:36:26,241 --> 00:36:27,241
I...

752
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,721
Peng Shi Yan,

753
00:36:33,281 --> 00:36:34,560
let me put it this way.

754
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,761
You should be grateful

755
00:36:37,001 --> 00:36:38,398
that Roubecca didn't leave you

756
00:36:38,481 --> 00:36:39,318
in the wilderness

757
00:36:39,401 --> 00:36:40,557
alone.

758
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,598
You have to be content, you know?

759
00:36:42,681 --> 00:36:43,878
She wanted to leave me behind.

760
00:36:43,961 --> 00:36:45,281
But I was stubborn.

761
00:37:19,481 --> 00:37:20,640
Intellectual my foot!

762
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,678
She forgot to fill up her gas tank
before setting off to this place.

763
00:37:23,761 --> 00:37:25,237
-Drive my car there.
-She would've still been stuck

764
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,238
on the road asking for help

765
00:37:26,321 --> 00:37:27,997
if it weren't for me.

766
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,080
Don't you think so?

767
00:37:29,241 --> 00:37:30,441
She's leaving angrily.

768
00:37:31,041 --> 00:37:32,441
-Professor Ren.
-Let's go.

769
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,560
Okay.

770
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,681
Peng Shi Yan was abandoned by
Roubecca on the road.

771
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,800
Master,

772
00:37:45,001 --> 00:37:46,158
I thought we were holding a meeting?

773
00:37:46,241 --> 00:37:47,118
Why are we

774
00:37:47,201 --> 00:37:48,721
harvesting mugwort now?

775
00:37:49,721 --> 00:37:52,400
Why aren't you calling me
your nephew today?

776
00:37:56,521 --> 00:37:58,043
Yesterday, together with my senior,

777
00:37:58,761 --> 00:38:00,640
which was Fellow Zhang,

778
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,320
we had

779
00:38:02,921 --> 00:38:04,961
a long chat.

780
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:08,241
He told me that if I truly
wanted to learn,

781
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,521
I need to have a respectful heart.

782
00:38:11,256 --> 00:38:12,198
That means

783
00:38:12,281 --> 00:38:14,800
I have to respect my teachers
from the bottom of my heart.

784
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:16,838
It's not like I called you nephew

785
00:38:16,921 --> 00:38:17,718
because I disrespected you.

786
00:38:17,801 --> 00:38:19,438
We're relatives, right?

787
00:38:19,521 --> 00:38:21,317
I called you Nephew because
I thought it sounded endearing.

788
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,481
And, he said

789
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:27,160
inheritance is just like a river
flowing into the sea.

790
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,557
Water flows downwards.

791
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,921
Once I have a respectful heart,

792
00:38:32,281 --> 00:38:34,477
I can learn and absorb
my master's teaching

793
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,678
just like how the sea
accommodates the rivers

794
00:38:35,761 --> 00:38:37,281
by absorbing them.

795
00:38:37,674 --> 00:38:38,674
He even said

796
00:38:38,761 --> 00:38:41,160
there are 64 hexagrams
in the Book of Changes.

797
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:44,158
Every hexagram has its pros and cons.

798
00:38:44,241 --> 00:38:45,921
There are both sides to them.

799
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:47,557
However, there's only one thing

800
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,814
that doesn't have any cons.

801
00:38:49,668 --> 00:38:50,668
That is...

802
00:38:50,842 --> 00:38:51,842
Modesty.

803
00:38:53,157 --> 00:38:53,958
That's right.

804
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:55,080
As the saying goes,

805
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,691
pride comes before a fall.

806
00:38:57,481 --> 00:38:58,997
Yes. That's it.

807
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,557
Anyway, Fellow Zhang told me

808
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,797
to obey my mentor
and be respectful to them.

809
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:04,880
That's right.

810
00:39:11,721 --> 00:39:13,918
Tou Tou, you've improved upon
two points today.

811
00:39:14,001 --> 00:39:16,961
First, you're able to
take other people's advice.

812
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,961
Second, you know
how to raise questions now.

813
00:39:19,721 --> 00:39:20,721
Very good.

814
00:39:22,514 --> 00:39:24,674
Actually, we're

815
00:39:25,441 --> 00:39:26,721
stagnant most of the time.

816
00:39:27,001 --> 00:39:30,001
The Dragon Boat Festival coincides
with the activation of Yang energy.

817
00:39:30,761 --> 00:39:32,979
When you stay active,
it activates your Yang energy.

818
00:39:33,241 --> 00:39:35,077
And, mugwort helps
generate warmer Yang energy.

819
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,481
That's why today,

820
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,237
we're harvesting mugwort
to generate warmer Yang energy.

821
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,712
How does harvesting mugwort
generate warmer Yang energy?

822
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,481
To put it accurately, mugwort
dredges our meridians.

823
00:39:44,721 --> 00:39:47,241
In the past, when our predecessors
went hunting,

824
00:39:47,481 --> 00:39:49,521
they'd be gone for a few days.

825
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,237
They didn't bring any water with them.

826
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,638
They only brought mugwort with them.

827
00:39:52,721 --> 00:39:53,639
When they were thirsty,

828
00:39:53,722 --> 00:39:55,800
they would dig a hole

829
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,204
and ignite some mugwort.

830
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:01,800
The smoke that was produced by burning
mugwort would flow underground.

831
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,041
If they saw smoke on the far side,

832
00:40:05,201 --> 00:40:07,961
it meant that
there was water underground.

833
00:40:09,001 --> 00:40:11,041
During our class, I talked about

834
00:40:11,681 --> 00:40:13,158
how Tao follows the ways of itself.

835
00:40:13,241 --> 00:40:14,958
The ways of Heaven, Earth, and Man

836
00:40:15,041 --> 00:40:16,041
are interconnected.

837
00:40:16,721 --> 00:40:17,721
What is Tao?

838
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,761
Tao is regularity.

839
00:40:21,721 --> 00:40:23,120
Mugwort

840
00:40:23,281 --> 00:40:25,880
can dredge the earthly meridians.

841
00:40:26,241 --> 00:40:28,521
It has the same effect on our body.

842
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:32,201
It can overcome resistance
and find the cause.

843
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,241
In the past,

844
00:40:35,441 --> 00:40:37,360
I thought the heat during moxibustion

845
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,077
was the element that cured illnesses.

846
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,320
I never expected it to be the smoke.

847
00:40:41,721 --> 00:40:44,281
No matter if it's the heat or smoke,

848
00:40:45,441 --> 00:40:48,761
it's beneficial to
the patient's recovery.

849
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,858
What does "beneficial" mean?

850
00:40:52,201 --> 00:40:53,462
That means it's good for you.

851
00:40:55,481 --> 00:40:56,638
If mugwort is that good,

852
00:40:56,721 --> 00:40:57,721
I have to harvest

853
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,080
more of them today.

854
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,398
After harvesting them,

855
00:41:01,481 --> 00:41:03,400
you can hang it on your door

856
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:06,080
or take a bath with it.

857
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,560
It's good for your body.

858
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,192
It generates warmer Yang energy.

859
00:41:15,241 --> 00:41:16,241
Let's hurry.

860
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:25,298
(Mugwort)

861
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:30,605
(Warms the meridians, stops bleeding,
expels coldness, stops pain, and so on)

862
00:41:30,961 --> 00:41:32,041
This place is amazing.

863
00:41:32,241 --> 00:41:33,118
The weather is great too.

864
00:41:33,201 --> 00:41:34,638
-Okay.
-What do you think that looks like?

865
00:41:34,721 --> 00:41:36,118
-Professor Ren.
-A huge tea plantation.

866
00:41:36,201 --> 00:41:37,201
Professor Ren.

867
00:41:38,241 --> 00:41:39,241
What's the matter?

868
00:41:39,961 --> 00:41:41,598
-I need you to do me a favour.
-What is it?

869
00:41:41,681 --> 00:41:43,320
My daughter is having a high fever.

870
00:41:44,041 --> 00:41:45,317
I don't know

871
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,118
if it was because she had something bad

872
00:41:47,201 --> 00:41:47,919
or caught a cold.

873
00:41:48,002 --> 00:41:49,477
I just gave her fever medicine
this morning.

874
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,757
But now, she's feverish again.

875
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,557
Professor Ren,
please give her a diagnosis.

876
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:54,640
Calm down.

877
00:41:55,201 --> 00:41:56,521
Mr Zheng, don't be anxious.

878
00:41:57,681 --> 00:42:00,160
There's no need to be anxious
when your child has a fever.

879
00:42:00,331 --> 00:42:01,158
Look.

880
00:42:01,241 --> 00:42:03,155
We have all the physicians
in the world here.

881
00:42:03,281 --> 00:42:04,281
Yeah, Mr Zheng.

882
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:07,041
It's common for children to catch a cold

883
00:42:07,241 --> 00:42:08,237
or have a fever.

884
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,958
We TCM practitioners have been
studying this topic

885
00:42:10,041 --> 00:42:11,481
for millenniums.

886
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,552
Let me recommend someone to you.

887
00:42:14,241 --> 00:42:16,241
What about the son
of Professor Ren, Tian Zhen?

888
00:42:18,236 --> 00:42:19,875
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

889
00:42:19,958 --> 00:42:21,357
(are referenced from relevant
traditional Chinese medicine books)

890
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,788
(Do not use without medical advice)
(End of Episode 10)
