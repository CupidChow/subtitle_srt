(Gen Z)

2
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,702
(Episode 10)

3
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,102
Mum,

4
00:01:44,721 --> 00:01:46,601
the TCM forum will be held

5
00:01:46,601 --> 00:01:48,641
on the Dragon Boat Festival.

6
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,921
Why don't you and Dad stay at home?

7
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,681
We can meet up next time.

8
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,960
♫ Heavens above ♫

9
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:50,361
♫ Who can rival me? ♫

10
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,880
♫ With Qingfeng Sword in my hand ♫

11
00:02:53,121 --> 00:02:55,520
♫ Who else can slay
a dragon with one hand? ♫

12
00:02:55,721 --> 00:02:56,761
Nice!

13
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,681
Very nice!

14
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,801
Please.

15
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:11,081
Heroine, sing us another song.

16
00:03:12,161 --> 00:03:12,990
Let me clap for you.

17
00:03:15,001 --> 00:03:15,782
Please.

18
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,385
Okay.

19
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,601
♫ Heavens above ♫

20
00:03:52,801 --> 00:03:54,680
♫ Who can rival me? ♫

21
00:03:56,801 --> 00:03:57,881
♫ With Qingfeng Sword in my hand ♫

22
00:03:57,881 --> 00:04:00,040
♫ Who else can slay
a dragon with one hand? ♫

23
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,721
Mum, what's wrong?

24
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,745
What's going on?

25
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,200
It's nothing.

26
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,801
The medicinal brew just dried up.

27
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,480
The medicinal brew dried up?

28
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,001
I thought Tou Tou was supposed
to keep an eye on it?

29
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,081
Come out.

30
00:04:31,601 --> 00:04:32,498
Meng Meng!

31
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:33,975
Meng Meng!

32
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,829
Meng Meng.

33
00:04:39,081 --> 00:04:40,280
I'm here for you. Don't be scared.

34
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,833
Everything's fine.

35
00:04:50,521 --> 00:04:51,881
Did you guys tell her
to keep an eye on the brew?

36
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,241
She wanted to do it of her own accord.

37
00:04:54,721 --> 00:04:56,801
She was doing great
for the past few days.

38
00:04:57,081 --> 00:04:58,521
Doing great?

39
00:04:59,081 --> 00:05:00,640
A fire almost happened because of her.

40
00:05:01,521 --> 00:05:02,441
Where is she?

41
00:05:05,081 --> 00:05:06,022
Tian Zhen.

42
00:05:07,801 --> 00:05:08,881
Is Tou Tou sleeping?

43
00:05:09,361 --> 00:05:10,215
Tell her to come downstairs.

44
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,081
She's not in the room.

45
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:15,601
-She's not around?
-Call her.

46
00:05:17,521 --> 00:05:18,521
Maybe she went loitering...

47
00:05:18,521 --> 00:05:19,417
Call her.

48
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,522
That must be Tou Tou.

49
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,599
Hello. We're the management team.

50
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,721
The smoke alarm was sounded.

51
00:05:31,721 --> 00:05:32,560
Did something happen?

52
00:05:33,108 --> 00:05:34,707
It's nothing. We already
dealt with the issue.

53
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,720
Thank you for coming.

54
00:05:35,721 --> 00:05:36,760
We have to inspect the scene

55
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,001
to prevent any potential hazards.

56
00:05:39,801 --> 00:05:40,884
Please come in then.

57
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,360
Sun Tou Tou, where are you?

58
00:05:57,641 --> 00:05:58,495
Hello.

59
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,321
I'm not the phone owner.

60
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,161
Who are you then?

61
00:06:02,721 --> 00:06:03,562
Where's the phone owner?

62
00:06:04,441 --> 00:06:05,840
I'm a security guard
of Danguiyuan Villa.

63
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,080
I was patrolling the nearby area

64
00:06:08,441 --> 00:06:09,441
when I saw this phone ringing.

65
00:06:09,441 --> 00:06:10,321
That's why I answered it.

66
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,520
The phone owner is...

67
00:06:13,881 --> 00:06:15,001
I didn't see her.

68
00:06:15,001 --> 00:06:16,041
There's no one here.

69
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,360
There's no one there?

70
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,000
This is bad. She might have
jumped into the lake.

71
00:06:30,161 --> 00:06:31,800
I found her socks here.

72
00:06:33,001 --> 00:06:34,321
I tried to scoop the lake,

73
00:06:34,321 --> 00:06:35,240
but I found nothing.

74
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,441
How deep is this lake?

75
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:41,833
It's not that deep.

76
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,321
It's not even two meters deep.

77
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:46,041
But someone drowned here last year.

78
00:06:48,161 --> 00:06:49,441
Is she drunk?

79
00:06:50,161 --> 00:06:51,280
I found several
empty beer bottles there.

80
00:06:52,001 --> 00:06:52,921
I'm sure she's drunk.

81
00:06:57,201 --> 00:06:58,321
Let's find her first.

82
00:07:00,601 --> 00:07:01,398
Tian Zhen,

83
00:07:02,001 --> 00:07:02,875
you know how to swim.

84
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,321
Search for her under the lake.

85
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,481
Okay.

86
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,201
I'll check over there then.

87
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,201
Tian Zhen, be careful.

88
00:07:32,441 --> 00:07:33,280
Tian Zhen, be careful.

89
00:07:34,881 --> 00:07:35,670
Make sure your steps are solid.

90
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,374
I found her!

91
00:07:42,601 --> 00:07:43,441
Dad, I found her!

92
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,220
I found her!

93
00:07:45,761 --> 00:07:46,573
Mum!

94
00:07:52,721 --> 00:07:53,680
You want to take

95
00:07:54,001 --> 00:07:55,481
a person like her to the TCM forum?

96
00:07:55,721 --> 00:07:56,960
Do you want everyone

97
00:07:57,201 --> 00:07:58,481
to laugh at us?

98
00:07:58,601 --> 00:08:00,001
You're taking her to the TCM forum?

99
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,160
Are you asking me?

100
00:08:03,321 --> 00:08:04,560
Didn't you read the group chat?

101
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:07,680
The name list is inside.

102
00:08:07,881 --> 00:08:08,960
Your name is included too.

103
00:08:10,481 --> 00:08:11,520
Can I skip it?

104
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,761
Someone needs to take care of Meng Meng.

105
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,736
No.

106
00:08:13,761 --> 00:08:15,001
This is a valuable chance
for you to learn something.

107
00:08:15,001 --> 00:08:16,441
We should let my seniors

108
00:08:16,441 --> 00:08:17,641
join the forum instead.

109
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,960
I have plenty of chances in the future.

110
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,796
No.

111
00:08:20,001 --> 00:08:20,921
You have to go.

112
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:22,520
But why?

113
00:08:23,161 --> 00:08:25,120
Your great-uncle is the president
of the forum this year.

114
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,560
He designated you to go.

115
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,405
Fine then.

116
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,481
Great-uncle is amazing indeed.

117
00:08:30,721 --> 00:08:31,520
No one can defy the words of a fellow.

118
00:08:32,201 --> 00:08:33,680
However, I have to take
Meng Meng with me.

119
00:08:35,201 --> 00:08:36,080
You're taking her along?

120
00:08:37,441 --> 00:08:38,274
That won't do.

121
00:08:38,507 --> 00:08:41,120
We've already told the organisers
about the number of people we'll bring.

122
00:08:41,481 --> 00:08:42,680
We cannot add or subtract them at will.

123
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,101
Mum,

124
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:45,441
what if Meng Meng wakes up

125
00:08:45,601 --> 00:08:47,041
and causes a ruckus in the middle
of the night after my departure?

126
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,360
Will you coax her then?

127
00:08:53,721 --> 00:08:54,531
What should we do then?

128
00:08:56,023 --> 00:08:56,979
Why don't we

129
00:08:57,441 --> 00:08:58,761
tell Meng Meng's mother

130
00:08:58,966 --> 00:09:00,006
to take her home?

131
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,280
I'll discuss it with Li Quan.

132
00:09:03,481 --> 00:09:04,481
He can stay.

133
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:05,960
We're very close to each other.

134
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,201
I'm sure he'll be fine with it.

135
00:09:09,118 --> 00:09:10,960
Check on Tou Tou when
you go upstairs later.

136
00:09:11,161 --> 00:09:12,280
She just threw up.

137
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:14,921
Make sure she doesn't have
anything stuck in her throat.

138
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,406
I'll go.

139
00:09:16,881 --> 00:09:18,641
I'm not sleeping tonight.
I'll look after them.

140
00:09:31,615 --> 00:09:33,533
Mum, we can talk tomorrow.

141
00:09:33,601 --> 00:09:34,680
You've been busy all night.

142
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,680
Get back to sleep.

143
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:40,601
Where did you go tonight?

144
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,881
I didn't go anywhere.

145
00:09:44,201 --> 00:09:45,120
Look into my eyes.

146
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,321
You went drinking with Sun Tou Tou, huh?

147
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,441
Nope.

148
00:09:57,161 --> 00:09:58,120
Really?

149
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:10,720
You're lucky that
nothing happened to her today.

150
00:10:11,961 --> 00:10:13,160
If something does happen to her,

151
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,560
we'll be

152
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,160
imprisoned for it.

153
00:10:26,441 --> 00:10:27,920
I know you don't like her.

154
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,881
Even so, you mustn't harm her.

155
00:10:30,961 --> 00:10:33,001
You need to keep your conscience clear.

156
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:35,321
Mum, we just had a few drinks.

157
00:10:35,321 --> 00:10:37,201
I never expected her
to fall into the lake.

158
00:10:39,281 --> 00:10:41,441
Now, you're so close to her
that you can drink together with her

159
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:43,321
and call her your buddy, huh?

160
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,720
Tian Zhen, listen carefully.

161
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:50,720
Whether Sun Tou Tou
can stay in this family or not

162
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,881
depends on

163
00:10:51,881 --> 00:10:53,641
her performance.

164
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,281
But it's different for you.

165
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:58,720
You have to establish
your own family in the future.

166
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,360
If your father hears about this,

167
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,961
he'll chase you out of the family
before Sun Tou Tou.

168
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,720
If you don't adjust your state of mind

169
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:11,360
and co-exist with her,

170
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,841
I may not be able to
defend you next time.

171
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:19,961
Mum,

172
00:11:19,961 --> 00:11:21,201
I know my fault now.

173
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,281
I won't do it again.

174
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,160
Again?

175
00:11:25,788 --> 00:11:26,683
What are you smiling at?

176
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,680
Mum, I won't do it again.

177
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,081
Stay away from her.

178
00:11:40,641 --> 00:11:41,961
And, stay away

179
00:11:42,841 --> 00:11:44,240
from that girl as well.

180
00:11:45,281 --> 00:11:47,281
This is a serious warning.

181
00:11:59,841 --> 00:12:00,841
Mum, what do you want?

182
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,761
Tend to your own needs.

183
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,625
Come.

184
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,069
Tian Zhen.

185
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:08,961
Have a herbal tea egg.

186
00:12:10,081 --> 00:12:11,321
I feel like I'm dying.

187
00:12:14,081 --> 00:12:14,998
This feels terrible.

188
00:12:16,401 --> 00:12:17,920
I'm going to die.

189
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,800
What nonsense are you uttering
this early in the morning?

190
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,160
I feel terrible.

191
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,360
I feel cold and hot at the same time.

192
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,961
Your pulse is tender and weak.

193
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,521
Seems like you need to
take Chinese medicine.

194
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,001
No way.

195
00:12:37,001 --> 00:12:38,641
I'll be fine after a few days.

196
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,800
I'm going to sleep.

197
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,358
Finish the hot congee.

198
00:12:47,841 --> 00:12:48,756
Avoid other food.

199
00:12:50,401 --> 00:12:51,720
Must I have it by itself?

200
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,240
-Yes.
-Without anything else?

201
00:12:53,841 --> 00:12:54,752
But...

202
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,841
Who did you drink
together with last night?

203
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,042
I

204
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,056
drank alone.

205
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,160
You finished eight bottles of beer

206
00:13:23,841 --> 00:13:25,961
and an entire bottle of Shaoxing wine?

207
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,600
Shaoxing wine?

208
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:31,878
Wait.

209
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,081
You said this yourself.

210
00:13:34,081 --> 00:13:35,920
To invite the moon I raise my cup.

211
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,800
We’re three, as my shadow shows up.

212
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,720
I just wanted to see

213
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,841
how it became three people.

214
00:13:42,841 --> 00:13:44,401
I was just curious about that.

215
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,441
I was just wondering

216
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,360
how it became three people.

217
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,961
It was pretty strange to me.

218
00:13:51,281 --> 00:13:52,521
You drank

219
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,040
all those liquor by yourself?

220
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,160
Everybody knows that
I can hold my liquor well.

221
00:13:59,321 --> 00:14:01,281
I got drunk because I consumed
different types of alcohol.

222
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,800
If you mix beer with rice wine, it'll...

223
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,650
Tou Tou,

224
00:14:06,281 --> 00:14:08,480
you mustn't lie in front of Master.

225
00:14:11,521 --> 00:14:12,800
You must be honest.

226
00:14:13,961 --> 00:14:15,881
If I discover that you're lying,

227
00:14:15,881 --> 00:14:17,240
I'll punish you severely.

228
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,961
Are you going to chase me out?

229
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,441
I will face the music alone.

230
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,281
I drank by myself.

231
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,360
It has nothing to do with other people.

232
00:14:44,521 --> 00:14:45,408
Do not do it again.

233
00:14:47,401 --> 00:14:49,120
Copy Virtue of A Great Physician
for the entire month.

234
00:14:51,961 --> 00:14:55,480
You wanted to tend to
Meng Meng's medicine yourself.

235
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,040
In the end, you failed your mission.

236
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:58,920
Not only did you break your promise
and behave irresponsibly,

237
00:14:59,081 --> 00:15:01,401
but you also wasted
Meng Meng's medicine.

238
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,720
Meng Meng hasn't even taken
her medicine yet today.

239
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,545
Meng Meng,

240
00:15:07,841 --> 00:15:08,841
I'm sorry.

241
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,281
Last night was an accident.

242
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,881
It definitely won't happen again.

243
00:15:13,881 --> 00:15:15,841
Look at me.

244
00:15:15,841 --> 00:15:17,160
I've suffered my retribution.

245
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,521
Will you please forgive me?

246
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,081
Meng Meng forgave me.

247
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,428
I can't take it anymore.

248
00:15:25,641 --> 00:15:26,881
Can I take a nap?

249
00:15:27,081 --> 00:15:28,040
Show me your hand.

250
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:31,920
Measure your right pulse
with your left hand.

251
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,401
Nephew,

252
00:15:33,401 --> 00:15:34,401
do you know

253
00:15:34,841 --> 00:15:35,841
what situation we're in?

254
00:15:35,841 --> 00:15:38,480
You're still trying to train me here?

255
00:15:39,641 --> 00:15:41,641
-Goodness.
-Practice makes perfect.

256
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,600
Rome wasn't built in a day.

257
00:15:43,841 --> 00:15:46,281
Feel your beating pulse.

258
00:15:46,641 --> 00:15:47,521
Did you detect any changes

259
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,040
besides the beating?

260
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,040
Wait.

261
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,600
It isn't beating anymore.

262
00:16:00,401 --> 00:16:01,280
Wait!

263
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,560
Why isn't it beating anymore?

264
00:16:03,841 --> 00:16:05,001
What's going on?

265
00:16:05,001 --> 00:16:06,281
Examine me!

266
00:16:06,281 --> 00:16:07,160
Examine me!

267
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,281
Am I dying?

268
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,600
-Here.
-Niece-in-law!

269
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:11,560
Finish this.

270
00:16:11,761 --> 00:16:12,841
What is this?

271
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,401
Examine my pulse!

272
00:16:14,961 --> 00:16:16,720
Finish the Fukangling.

273
00:16:17,841 --> 00:16:18,720
Take it while it's hot.

274
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:22,160
This is amulet water?

275
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,281
Will I die?

276
00:16:25,281 --> 00:16:27,160
Must I take amulet water now?

277
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,600
It's not amulet water.

278
00:16:28,961 --> 00:16:29,841
It's a health drink.

279
00:16:31,401 --> 00:16:33,160
What exactly is it?

280
00:16:34,281 --> 00:16:35,441
It's spicy hot pot soup.

281
00:16:38,641 --> 00:16:39,600
That's impossible.

282
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,641
You lied to me.

283
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,160
It doesn't taste like hot pot at all.

284
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,160
It tastes like Chinese medicine to me.

285
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:47,160
It's made with medicinal ingredients
you can find in the kitchen.

286
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,600
For example, dried ginger,
dried orange peel,

287
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,641
red dates, and so on.

288
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,600
It dispels coldness.

289
00:16:52,841 --> 00:16:54,560
You got drunk last night.

290
00:16:55,521 --> 00:16:56,961
Your spleen and stomach are heaty.

291
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,401
Your body was heaty too.

292
00:16:58,401 --> 00:16:59,720
When you jumped into the lake,

293
00:17:00,841 --> 00:17:02,081
the water was cold.

294
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,800
Coldness is born below the feet.

295
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,360
Heat and coldness started
fighting in your middle energizer,

296
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,641
which consists of your spleen

297
00:17:08,641 --> 00:17:09,560
and stomach.

298
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,720
Essentially, it's your stomach.

299
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,281
Actually, your body

300
00:17:13,281 --> 00:17:15,081
was expelling sweat automatically.

301
00:17:15,521 --> 00:17:17,480
It's stated clearly within
Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic,

302
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,961
Discourse on Heat.

303
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,240
Now, as for heat diseases,

304
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,281
they all are of the type
"harm caused by cold".

305
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,881
No matter if your body is heaty

306
00:17:26,881 --> 00:17:28,600
or if you have diarrhoea,

307
00:17:28,961 --> 00:17:31,160
as long as it's not food poisoning,

308
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,600
it's mostly caused by coldness.

309
00:17:34,401 --> 00:17:36,040
Let me give you an example.

310
00:17:36,401 --> 00:17:38,040
For example, the doors
and windows in our house

311
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,081
are closed.

312
00:17:39,081 --> 00:17:40,600
Nothing can get out of the house.

313
00:17:40,858 --> 00:17:41,687
What should we do then?

314
00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:43,281
I'll open a window.

315
00:17:44,401 --> 00:17:47,160
We can take pungent
and warm-natured drugs

316
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:50,720
so that our body will expel
the coldness automatically.

317
00:17:51,281 --> 00:17:52,401
Our bodies will recover by then.

318
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,600
You said this too.

319
00:17:57,729 --> 00:17:59,300
When joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure
have not yet arisen,

320
00:17:59,347 --> 00:18:00,531
it is called "moderate".

321
00:18:00,641 --> 00:18:03,920
When they arise to their appropriate
levels, it is called "harmony".

322
00:18:04,401 --> 00:18:07,240
That means if we stick to a diet

323
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,480
and adopt a healthy lifestyle,

324
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,401
we won't

325
00:18:09,401 --> 00:18:10,480
fall sick.

326
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,920
If we do fall sick,

327
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,160
we just need to overcompensate for it.

328
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:13,961
This way,

329
00:18:13,961 --> 00:18:14,920
we'll recover from our illness.

330
00:18:16,081 --> 00:18:16,920
Was that what you meant?

331
00:18:17,281 --> 00:18:18,961
Yes. Finish it while it's hot.

332
00:18:29,081 --> 00:18:30,600
No, I need to take a nap.

333
00:18:36,961 --> 00:18:38,360
You don't even let me take Shumai.

334
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,161
She's a promising student.

335
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,120
Look at your so-called good son!

336
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,960
Who said girls were inferior to guys?

337
00:19:04,401 --> 00:19:05,720
I will hand over my position
as the leader of the sect

338
00:19:06,161 --> 00:19:07,161
to Tou Tou in the future.

339
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,521
Look at that son of yours.

340
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,281
No matter if it's courage or knowledge,

341
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:12,801
he's no match

342
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,521
for a parentless child

343
00:19:14,521 --> 00:19:15,881
who wasn't even educated.

344
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,641
He's not ready at all!

345
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,001
You want me to chase Tou Tou
out of the house?

346
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:23,960
In your dreams.

347
00:19:26,281 --> 00:19:27,641
If he does this again,

348
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,681
I'll chase him out

349
00:19:28,681 --> 00:19:29,600
without any mercy!

350
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,840
What a shame.

351
00:20:09,521 --> 00:20:11,840
The 30-year-old Nu Er Hong wine
had gone to waste.

352
00:20:13,641 --> 00:20:15,200
It would've been nourishing

353
00:20:16,001 --> 00:20:18,161
for the little girl

354
00:20:18,521 --> 00:20:20,281
if she took it moderately.

355
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,600
If my foolish grandson

356
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,600
was out to harm her,

357
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,761
he didn't need to resort to
using such valuable liquor.

358
00:20:26,921 --> 00:20:27,960
He could've gotten a random
bottle of liquor

359
00:20:28,161 --> 00:20:29,681
downstairs.

360
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,840
I'm being harsh again.

361
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:37,163
I will reflect upon my actions.

362
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:38,477
I will reflect upon my actions.

363
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,106
(Qibo Medical Centre)

364
00:20:59,641 --> 00:21:00,761
Mr Wu, you're here?

365
00:21:00,761 --> 00:21:01,881
We're on our lunch break now.

366
00:21:01,881 --> 00:21:03,120
It's fine. I'm looking for Xin Zheng.

367
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,080
He's preparing prescriptions
at the back.

368
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,240
Okay. I'll wait for him.

369
00:21:05,401 --> 00:21:06,251
Okay.

370
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,200
Hubby, is this the place?

371
00:21:09,761 --> 00:21:10,960
Look at this medical centre.

372
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,960
It's so high-class.

373
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,720
Quan is working here.

374
00:21:16,001 --> 00:21:17,001
This is great.

375
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,041
Mr Wu?

376
00:21:18,401 --> 00:21:19,801
-You're here.
-Are you busy?

377
00:21:20,641 --> 00:21:22,240
-Resume your work.
-Let me get you a drink.

378
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,521
It's fine. I can do that myself.

379
00:21:24,401 --> 00:21:26,360
Are you two here to get a diagnosis?

380
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,960
Or are you guys to seek
other treatments?

381
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,761
We're not here to seek physicians.

382
00:21:28,761 --> 00:21:29,600
We're looking for someone.

383
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,600
He's working here.

384
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,881
-Who are you guys looking for then?
-Dad? Mum?

385
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,817
Quan.

386
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,721
-Son.
-What are you two doing here?

387
00:21:37,761 --> 00:21:39,041
We're here to visit you.

388
00:21:40,281 --> 00:21:41,561
This place is great.

389
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,001
This is great.

390
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,881
The environment here is so nice.

391
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,521
Mr Wu,

392
00:21:47,001 --> 00:21:48,080
thank you

393
00:21:48,281 --> 00:21:50,001
for helping Quan to get a job.

394
00:21:50,881 --> 00:21:52,600
Thank you so much.

395
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,881
His father and I

396
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,881
are uneducated.

397
00:21:54,881 --> 00:21:55,960
We don't have any skills too.

398
00:21:56,401 --> 00:21:58,681
We'll depend on him
to provide for the family in the future.

399
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,199
-Your kid is pretty good.
-Thank you.

400
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,801
Thank you for your help.

401
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:03,240
What are you doing?

402
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,401
You must accept this.

403
00:22:06,401 --> 00:22:07,960
This is for Professor Ren.

404
00:22:08,001 --> 00:22:08,960
This is for you.

405
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,120
One of you helped our child

406
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,080
to get a job

407
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,881
while the other is
our child's superior.

408
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,440
Both of you are our benefactors.

409
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,396
Have a seat.

410
00:22:17,761 --> 00:22:18,761
We were just

411
00:22:18,761 --> 00:22:19,881
fated to meet.

412
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,360
I cannot accept your gifts.

413
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,521
No. Mr Wu,

414
00:22:23,521 --> 00:22:24,921
you have to accept this.

415
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,881
This is just a token of
our appreciation.

416
00:22:27,001 --> 00:22:30,001
To you, it might be just
lifting a finger.

417
00:22:30,161 --> 00:22:31,440
However, to our family,

418
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,840
it's a debt of gratitude
that we can never repay.

419
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,681
Our village chief said

420
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,881
the household register here

421
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,401
is worth

422
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,240
several million yuan.

423
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,401
-Household register?
-That's right.

424
00:22:43,401 --> 00:22:46,401
We're very thankful that
the medical centre could help Quan

425
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,240
to set his household register here.

426
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,660
What about this?

427
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,001
I'll accept your gifts

428
00:23:04,001 --> 00:23:06,161
this time.

429
00:23:07,001 --> 00:23:09,240
But you must never bring them again,

430
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:10,371
okay?

431
00:23:10,881 --> 00:23:11,726
It's a promise.

432
00:23:13,049 --> 00:23:13,883
Li Quan,

433
00:23:14,641 --> 00:23:16,120
youngsters like you all

434
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,600
are the future of the TCM industry.

435
00:23:19,521 --> 00:23:20,881
You have to work hard,

436
00:23:21,342 --> 00:23:22,232
understood?

437
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,200
It's rare for your parents
to visit Jiangzhou.

438
00:23:25,401 --> 00:23:27,120
You should take them around.

439
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,401
-Okay.
-Please visit the city.

440
00:23:30,401 --> 00:23:31,320
Thank you.

441
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,001
Don't worry. Your child
is under my care.

442
00:23:34,641 --> 00:23:36,120
Okay. Thank you.

443
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:49,200
You should break the news to him.

444
00:23:49,521 --> 00:23:51,001
You should do it.

445
00:23:51,001 --> 00:23:52,360
How can I do it?

446
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,200
This matter is too...

447
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,881
He's our son. What are you afraid of?

448
00:23:54,881 --> 00:23:55,761
What am I afraid of?

449
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:56,921
Look at what you're saying.

450
00:23:57,161 --> 00:23:57,971
Mum,

451
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,120
I thought I told you guys not to come?

452
00:24:00,401 --> 00:24:01,600
Why did you guys appear out of the blue?

453
00:24:02,161 --> 00:24:04,120
You said you'd be busy
during the Dragon Boat Festival, right?

454
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,080
That's why we came here earlier.

455
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,480
Okay then.

456
00:24:07,521 --> 00:24:08,801
You and Dad can wait here.

457
00:24:08,801 --> 00:24:10,161
I'll get changed and take you guys out.

458
00:24:10,281 --> 00:24:11,160
No need for that.

459
00:24:11,641 --> 00:24:13,001
You don't need to keep us company.

460
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,480
We'll leave after
delivering our message.

461
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,600
Please go ahead.

462
00:24:19,161 --> 00:24:20,032
Quan,

463
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:22,320
tell me something.

464
00:24:22,641 --> 00:24:25,561
How much do you earn per month?

465
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,142
Mum,

466
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,521
I started working not long ago.

467
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,840
I don't earn that much.

468
00:24:32,281 --> 00:24:33,720
That's why I don't have
a lot of savings.

469
00:24:35,401 --> 00:24:36,320
Yeah, I guess so.

470
00:24:38,401 --> 00:24:39,320
Mum, what's the matter?

471
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,120
Just tell me if
you're having any issues.

472
00:24:42,041 --> 00:24:43,960
You're talking to your own child,
you know?

473
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,761
There's no need to beat around the bush.

474
00:24:45,881 --> 00:24:47,521
Just break the news to him.
There's no need to be scared.

475
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,401
Do you have 20,000 yuan on you?

476
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,681
I plan

477
00:24:55,001 --> 00:24:56,401
to breed some lobster fry in our pond

478
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,360
so that we can make some money
during winter.

479
00:24:59,864 --> 00:25:00,698
Quan,

480
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:01,840
it's like this.

481
00:25:02,641 --> 00:25:04,120
There was a cold spell
during late spring.

482
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,281
Half of our fry were dead.

483
00:25:06,281 --> 00:25:07,641
Our investment went down the drain.

484
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,240
Your younger brother will be attending

485
00:25:09,881 --> 00:25:11,681
junior high this year.

486
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,401
We need to support him too.

487
00:25:15,041 --> 00:25:15,840
Mum,

488
00:25:16,761 --> 00:25:17,696
I understand now.

489
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,226
Dad,

490
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,641
I'll save up all the money I earn

491
00:25:21,641 --> 00:25:22,681
and send it back to you.

492
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:24,360
Wait, my child.

493
00:25:25,401 --> 00:25:26,232
You see,

494
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,761
it's quite embarrassing

495
00:25:28,281 --> 00:25:29,320
for us

496
00:25:30,521 --> 00:25:31,720
to ask our child for money too.

497
00:25:32,161 --> 00:25:33,840
But this is a special period.

498
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,360
Just tell me how much cash you have.

499
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,360
We're in no rush.

500
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,480
-That's not true.
-You just need to keep this in mind.

501
00:25:41,228 --> 00:25:42,027
Alright.

502
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,161
You should return to work.

503
00:25:43,161 --> 00:25:44,521
We're just here to check on you.

504
00:25:44,641 --> 00:25:45,720
We'll leave now.

505
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,521
Return to work.

506
00:25:46,881 --> 00:25:47,720
Everything's fine.

507
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,761
Don't apply for leave, okay?

508
00:25:50,761 --> 00:25:51,642
Let's go.

509
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,280
Let's leave now.

510
00:25:53,281 --> 00:25:54,281
-Wait.
-Hurry.

511
00:25:54,281 --> 00:25:55,095
See you.

512
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,320
Don't apply for leave, okay?

513
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,641
If not, they'll deduct your wage.

514
00:25:57,641 --> 00:25:59,200
Wait, we should take something
since we're already here.

515
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,600
-Let's go.
-Mum.

516
00:26:00,761 --> 00:26:01,840
Aren't you guys going to
spend the night here?

517
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,641
No. We don't want to waste money.

518
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,695
See you.

519
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,360
-But he...
-Let's go.

520
00:26:06,761 --> 00:26:07,881
-Goodness.
-We should at least get money from him.

521
00:26:07,881 --> 00:26:08,801
What are you saying?

522
00:26:08,801 --> 00:26:10,440
We can figure something out
when we head back.

523
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,382
Tian Zhen.

524
00:26:39,001 --> 00:26:40,041
-Which car am I taking?
-Sorry.

525
00:26:40,281 --> 00:26:41,681
I forgot to tell you.

526
00:26:41,681 --> 00:26:42,761
You see, it's like this.

527
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,840
If I go alone,

528
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,761
Meng Meng will be alone.

529
00:26:45,761 --> 00:26:46,840
Everyone will worry about her.

530
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,080
What about this?

531
00:26:48,503 --> 00:26:49,983
We'll have plenty of chances in the
future. You can go next time.

532
00:26:51,161 --> 00:26:52,600
I'm truly sorry about this.

533
00:26:52,809 --> 00:26:53,646
I forgot about it.

534
00:26:53,881 --> 00:26:55,041
-Okay.
-Okay?

535
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,394
It's fine.

536
00:26:58,641 --> 00:26:59,921
How is it? Is everyone ready?

537
00:26:59,921 --> 00:27:00,960
Let's depart then.

538
00:27:03,641 --> 00:27:04,641
Li Quan, follow me.

539
00:27:06,641 --> 00:27:07,576
What?

540
00:27:09,401 --> 00:27:10,960
Are you the only one who
can command students now?

541
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,120
I'm the academy's principal.

542
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,320
Can't I get myself a follower?

543
00:27:14,521 --> 00:27:15,480
Come on. Let's go.

544
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,026
Let's go.

545
00:27:19,521 --> 00:27:20,406
Let's go.

546
00:27:34,521 --> 00:27:35,346
Mr Wu,

547
00:27:36,881 --> 00:27:37,787
thank you.

548
00:27:41,881 --> 00:27:42,838
My child,

549
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,041
you remind me

550
00:27:46,521 --> 00:27:48,720
of my younger days.

551
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,766
(30 years ago)

552
00:27:58,108 --> 00:27:59,042
Ling Lan.

553
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,480
Shan Dao, you're here too?

554
00:28:07,775 --> 00:28:08,675
What's the matter?

555
00:28:09,401 --> 00:28:10,324
Take a sniff.

556
00:28:11,881 --> 00:28:13,521
This isn't a herb. These are flowers.

557
00:28:13,521 --> 00:28:14,521
Don't pick them for no reason.

558
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,360
Where are we?

559
00:29:29,041 --> 00:29:30,161
This is someone's house.

560
00:29:30,881 --> 00:29:32,041
The owner of this house

561
00:29:32,041 --> 00:29:34,360
is an entrepreneur

562
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,401
of the TCM industry.

563
00:29:35,641 --> 00:29:37,281
He sponsored many

564
00:29:37,641 --> 00:29:39,360
of the TCM funds.

565
00:29:40,001 --> 00:29:41,881
He also sponsored many students
for their studies.

566
00:29:42,001 --> 00:29:42,881
That's why we decided

567
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:44,041
to hold the forum here.

568
00:29:44,641 --> 00:29:46,281
Mainly, it's because there's a field

569
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,120
of mugwort behind his house.

570
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,360
The Dragon Goat Festival is a good time
to harvest them.

571
00:29:51,521 --> 00:29:52,435
Look.

572
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,641
There are even pomelo trees.

573
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,480
-Xin Zheng.
-Uncle.

574
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,890
Good.

575
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,204
Hello, Fellow Zhang.

576
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,561
-Hello, Fellow Zhang.
-Hello.

577
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,761
We'll depend on you for today's speech.

578
00:30:12,041 --> 00:30:12,881
No problem, Fellow Zhang.

579
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,041
-I'll head there first.
-Where's Tian Zhen?

580
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,199
Great-uncle.

581
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,720
I brought you some stinky beancurd

582
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,881
and preserved shrimp made by Grandma.

583
00:30:21,081 --> 00:30:21,914
Good.

584
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,161
-Good boy.
-I'll pass them to you later.

585
00:30:23,641 --> 00:30:24,573
Okay.

586
00:30:25,521 --> 00:30:26,761
Look at my sister.

587
00:30:26,881 --> 00:30:28,641
She has no regard for my dignity.

588
00:30:30,761 --> 00:30:32,240
But preserved beancurd is great.

589
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,240
I'm sure you guys

590
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,761
enjoyed the scent on your way here.

591
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,240
But it was

592
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,161
pretty terrible.

593
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,142
Xin Zheng,

594
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,561
I heard that you're holding
an apprentice class.

595
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,840
You're doing something noble
without announcing it.

596
00:30:47,037 --> 00:30:47,847
That's great.

597
00:30:48,041 --> 00:30:49,080
It's good for the nation and its people.

598
00:30:49,649 --> 00:30:50,545
Fellow Zhang,

599
00:30:50,641 --> 00:30:51,960
I was planning to tell you that.

600
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,120
This apprentice class,
which was my idea,

601
00:30:54,281 --> 00:30:56,440
has been blooming

602
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,001
under Professor Ren's lead.

603
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,156
However,

604
00:30:59,521 --> 00:31:00,641
there are still many obstacles
we need to overcome.

605
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,360
So, Fellow Zhang,

606
00:31:02,521 --> 00:31:03,600
please support us.

607
00:31:03,681 --> 00:31:04,505
Sure.

608
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,041
Aren't you the principal?

609
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,080
So, this is related to you?

610
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,840
Fellow Zhang, you have no idea.

611
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,521
Now, I'm letting Professor Ren

612
00:31:14,521 --> 00:31:16,641
bask in the glory and fame.

613
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:19,561
As for me, I'm dealing
with all the cumbersome matters.

614
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,761
Good job.

615
00:31:23,041 --> 00:31:23,905
Xin Zheng,

616
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,521
your apprentice class

617
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,120
is under the university, right?

618
00:31:28,881 --> 00:31:30,041
If so, the University of TCM

619
00:31:30,761 --> 00:31:32,240
has a great sense of responsibility.

620
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,545
Indeed.

621
00:31:33,881 --> 00:31:35,001
It's time for us

622
00:31:35,641 --> 00:31:37,120
to reform the education system.

623
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,521
We're returning to the roots
of TCM study, huh?

624
00:31:39,521 --> 00:31:42,561
The apprentice class is
a noble effort indeed.

625
00:31:44,881 --> 00:31:46,881
Chinese civilization has been through
all kinds of hardships.

626
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,521
But it didn't vanish
like the other civilizations.

627
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,881
I'm sure the apprentice classes
had played a major role in it.

628
00:31:53,881 --> 00:31:55,120
Shan Dao did help me a lot

629
00:31:55,616 --> 00:31:57,360
when it came to the apprentice class.

630
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:58,920
Mr Wu,

631
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,240
Professor Ren,

632
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,120
in the future, if you need
any contributions,

633
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,161
I can definitely

634
00:32:03,161 --> 00:32:04,240
do my part.

635
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:07,120
Professor Ren and his wife
saved my life after all.

636
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,240
Without Professor Ren,
I wouldn't be here.

637
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,161
He's mocking me.

638
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:14,001
Last time, when we were doing
the bloodletting therapy on the plane,

639
00:32:14,001 --> 00:32:14,866
it was hectic.

640
00:32:16,641 --> 00:32:18,041
What does that mean?

641
00:32:18,881 --> 00:32:20,001
Come here.

642
00:32:20,001 --> 00:32:20,848
Come here.

643
00:32:22,521 --> 00:32:23,382
Hurry up.

644
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,641
Hurry.

645
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,840
Greet Fellow Zhang.

646
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,360
Who is this young lady?

647
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,240
She's the successor of
the Jiang family's acupuncture sect,

648
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,720
Sun Tou Tou.

649
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,320
So, she's my junior?

650
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,240
Pardon me for the rudeness.

651
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,681
That was rude of me.

652
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,720
When my father was still around,

653
00:32:47,001 --> 00:32:47,908
I think...

654
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,360
It should be her grandmother.

655
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,521
That's right.

656
00:32:52,521 --> 00:32:54,041
Your grandmother

657
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,161
and my father

658
00:32:55,161 --> 00:32:56,881
were very close to each other.

659
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:00,991
What about this?

660
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:01,970
Later,

661
00:33:02,001 --> 00:33:03,360
I'll have a drink

662
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,960
with my junior here.

663
00:33:06,881 --> 00:33:07,761
Of course.

664
00:33:07,761 --> 00:33:08,840
I can hold my liquor well.

665
00:33:09,041 --> 00:33:11,080
You're following his cues, huh?

666
00:33:12,881 --> 00:33:13,724
Okay?

667
00:33:14,521 --> 00:33:16,401
Is one bottle enough?
Or do you need more?

668
00:33:16,401 --> 00:33:17,360
I don't think she can drink.

669
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,440
Please.

670
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,921
-Fellow Zhang.
-Hello.

671
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,001
You're here.

672
00:33:28,281 --> 00:33:29,161
Junior.

673
00:33:31,116 --> 00:33:31,950
Over here.

674
00:33:32,041 --> 00:33:32,952
Sit here.

675
00:33:35,295 --> 00:33:36,136
See you.

676
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,196
She's coming.

677
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:39,480
Come here.

678
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,323
Come.

679
00:33:42,401 --> 00:33:43,323
Tian Zhen.

680
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,128
Great-uncle.

681
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,120
Long time no see, huh?

682
00:33:47,228 --> 00:33:48,042
Yeah.

683
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,761
Your grandmother wanted me to test you.

684
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:50,595
Great-uncle,

685
00:33:50,761 --> 00:33:51,960
can I just enjoy my meal

686
00:33:52,001 --> 00:33:53,041
without being tested?

687
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,521
I'm nervous now.

688
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,761
Enjoy your meal. I won't test you today.

689
00:33:56,881 --> 00:33:58,641
-What's with the test?
-Yeah.

690
00:33:58,641 --> 00:33:59,761
Come here.

691
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,641
Great-uncle, I have to
take care of this patient.

692
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,161
I can't leave her here alone.

693
00:34:04,161 --> 00:34:05,001
I need to keep her company.

694
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,120
You guys can enjoy your meal.

695
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,761
What patient?

696
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,521
She must be your girlfriend.

697
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,401
-Take her here too.
-That's not it.

698
00:34:14,187 --> 00:34:15,960
Secretary Qian, get us two more chairs.

699
00:34:16,641 --> 00:34:18,881
We need to mingle with youngsters.

700
00:34:18,881 --> 00:34:19,729
That's right.

701
00:34:20,845 --> 00:34:21,709
Master.

702
00:34:22,401 --> 00:34:24,120
I don't think I'll drink today.

703
00:34:25,001 --> 00:34:26,041
I'm the eldest here
if we consider our seniority.

704
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,561
You can choose to drink less
on such occasions.

705
00:34:32,641 --> 00:34:33,446
I won't drink.

706
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:34,493
I'm not drinking today.

707
00:34:34,761 --> 00:34:36,840
I need to set a good example
for my juniors.

708
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,924
Sit properly.

709
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,231
Thank you.

710
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,295
Peng Shi Yan?

711
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:27,254
Peng Shi Yan.

712
00:35:28,881 --> 00:35:30,521
What are you doing here?

713
00:35:30,521 --> 00:35:31,840
-Why can't I be here?
-What's going on?

714
00:35:33,041 --> 00:35:33,978
Is she your friend?

715
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,041
Dormmate!

716
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,720
What are you doing here?

717
00:35:39,401 --> 00:35:40,196
Wait.

718
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,080
How come the two of you
came here together?

719
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:44,361
She brought me along.

720
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:45,445
I didn't.

721
00:35:46,521 --> 00:35:47,366
You're something else.

722
00:35:52,001 --> 00:35:53,041
Take me with you.

723
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,361
A spy like me

724
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:57,400
needs to head to the enemy's nest
to eradicate them once and for all.

725
00:35:59,001 --> 00:36:00,121
Take me with you.

726
00:36:00,121 --> 00:36:01,001
You're a renowned figure.

727
00:36:01,001 --> 00:36:02,640
You need to have a servant beside you.

728
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,440
Besides,

729
00:36:04,841 --> 00:36:06,521
the mountain path is rugged and uneven.

730
00:36:07,041 --> 00:36:08,081
I checked the schedule too.

731
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,880
We have to gather mugwort
before dawn on the second day.

732
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,200
I'm sure you'll depart at night.

733
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,720
What if you encounter a bear

734
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,521
or a robber? It'll be dangerous.

735
00:36:15,361 --> 00:36:16,440
Most importantly,

736
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:18,889
it's a long journey.

737
00:36:19,077 --> 00:36:21,477
You need a second driver somehow.

738
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,013
Thanks.

739
00:36:48,801 --> 00:36:49,841
Give me some time.

740
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,440
You can drive once I'm done throwing up.

741
00:36:54,281 --> 00:36:55,561
You'll drive once
you're done throwing up.

742
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,060
Why?

743
00:37:00,916 --> 00:37:01,757
I have motion sickness.

744
00:37:02,081 --> 00:37:03,321
You won't get that when you drive.

745
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:05,160
Only passengers will get that.

746
00:37:06,841 --> 00:37:07,677
I don't know how to.

747
00:37:09,321 --> 00:37:10,521
What do you mean by that?

748
00:37:10,841 --> 00:37:11,720
I don't know how to drive.

749
00:37:12,321 --> 00:37:13,601
You don't know how to drive?

750
00:37:14,455 --> 00:37:15,256
Why did you

751
00:37:15,281 --> 00:37:16,121
tell me that I needed you

752
00:37:16,121 --> 00:37:17,440
as my second driver then?

753
00:37:18,521 --> 00:37:20,321
Who opened the bottle cap for you
when you drank water?

754
00:37:20,801 --> 00:37:23,160
Who kept your bottle for you
once you were done drinking?

755
00:37:23,321 --> 00:37:24,160
I did my job as your co-driver...

756
00:37:44,001 --> 00:37:45,281
Why are you leaving without me?

757
00:37:52,361 --> 00:37:53,761
Wait for me!

758
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,081
Wait for me!

759
00:37:59,081 --> 00:37:59,949
I...

760
00:38:01,321 --> 00:38:02,276
I...

761
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,801
Peng Shi Yan,

762
00:38:08,361 --> 00:38:09,640
let me put it this way.

763
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,841
You should be grateful

764
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:13,561
that Roubecca didn't leave you

765
00:38:13,561 --> 00:38:14,480
in the wilderness

766
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,720
alone.

767
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,761
You have to be content, you know?

768
00:38:17,761 --> 00:38:18,801
She wanted to leave me behind.

769
00:38:19,041 --> 00:38:20,361
But I was stubborn.

770
00:38:54,561 --> 00:38:55,720
Intellectual my foot!

771
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,041
She forgot to fill up her gas tank
before setting off to this place.

772
00:38:58,841 --> 00:39:00,400
-Drive my car there.
-She would've still been stuck

773
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,400
on the road asking for help

774
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,160
if it weren't for me.

775
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,041
Don't you think so?

776
00:39:04,321 --> 00:39:05,521
She's leaving angrily.

777
00:39:06,121 --> 00:39:07,521
-Professor Ren.
-Let's go.

778
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:08,537
Okay.

779
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:12,761
Peng Shi Yan was abandoned by
Roubecca on the road.

780
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,712
Master,

781
00:39:20,081 --> 00:39:21,281
I thought we were holding a meeting?

782
00:39:21,321 --> 00:39:22,240
Why are we

783
00:39:22,281 --> 00:39:23,801
harvesting mugwort now?

784
00:39:24,801 --> 00:39:27,480
Why aren't you calling me
your nephew today?

785
00:39:31,601 --> 00:39:33,081
Yesterday, together with my senior,

786
00:39:33,841 --> 00:39:35,720
which was Fellow Zhang,

787
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,304
we had

788
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:40,041
a long chat.

789
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:43,321
He told me that if I truly
wanted to learn,

790
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,601
I need to have a respectful heart.

791
00:39:46,336 --> 00:39:47,336
That means

792
00:39:47,361 --> 00:39:49,880
I have to respect my teachers
from the bottom of my heart.

793
00:39:50,081 --> 00:39:52,001
It's not like I called you nephew

794
00:39:52,001 --> 00:39:52,880
because I disrespected you.

795
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,601
We're relatives, right?

796
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:56,480
I called you Nephew because
I thought it sounded endearing.

797
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,561
And, he said

798
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:02,240
inheritance is just like a river
flowing into the sea.

799
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,720
Water flows downwards.

800
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,001
Once I have a respectful heart,

801
00:40:07,361 --> 00:40:09,640
I can learn and absorb
my master's teaching

802
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,841
just like how the sea
accommodates the rivers

803
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:12,361
by absorbing them.

804
00:40:12,754 --> 00:40:13,554
He even said

805
00:40:13,841 --> 00:40:16,240
there are 64 hexagrams
in the Book of Changes.

806
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,281
Every hexagram has its pros and cons.

807
00:40:19,321 --> 00:40:21,001
There are both sides to them.

808
00:40:21,321 --> 00:40:22,480
However, there's only one thing

809
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,761
that doesn't have any cons.

810
00:40:24,748 --> 00:40:25,708
That is...

811
00:40:25,922 --> 00:40:26,708
Modesty.

812
00:40:28,237 --> 00:40:29,070
That's right.

813
00:40:29,121 --> 00:40:30,160
As the saying goes,

814
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,640
pride comes before a fall.

815
00:40:32,561 --> 00:40:34,160
Yes. That's it.

816
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,720
Anyway, Fellow Zhang told me

817
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:38,960
to obey my mentor
and be respectful to them.

818
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:39,857
That's right.

819
00:40:46,801 --> 00:40:49,081
Tou Tou, you've improved upon
two points today.

820
00:40:49,081 --> 00:40:52,041
First, you're able to
take other people's advice.

821
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,041
Second, you know
how to raise questions now.

822
00:40:54,801 --> 00:40:55,720
Very good.

823
00:40:57,594 --> 00:40:59,754
Actually, we're

824
00:41:00,521 --> 00:41:01,801
stagnant most of the time.

825
00:41:02,081 --> 00:41:04,400
The Dragon Boat Festival coincides
with the activation of Yang energy.

826
00:41:05,841 --> 00:41:07,081
When you stay active,
it activates your Yang energy.

827
00:41:08,321 --> 00:41:10,240
And, mugwort helps
generate warmer Yang energy.

828
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,561
That's why today,

829
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,761
we're harvesting mugwort
to generate warmer Yang energy.

830
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,960
How does harvesting mugwort
generate warmer Yang energy?

831
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,561
To put it accurately, mugwort
dredges our meridians.

832
00:41:19,801 --> 00:41:22,321
In the past, when our predecessors
went hunting,

833
00:41:22,561 --> 00:41:24,601
they'd be gone for a few days.

834
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:25,880
They didn't bring any water with them.

835
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,801
They only brought mugwort with them.

836
00:41:27,801 --> 00:41:28,801
When they were thirsty,

837
00:41:28,801 --> 00:41:30,880
they would dig a hole

838
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,281
and ignite some mugwort.

839
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:36,880
The smoke that was produced by burning
mugwort would flow underground.

840
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:40,121
If they saw smoke on the far side,

841
00:41:40,281 --> 00:41:43,041
it meant that
there was water underground.

842
00:41:44,081 --> 00:41:46,121
During our class, I talked about

843
00:41:46,761 --> 00:41:47,960
how Tao follows the ways of itself.

844
00:41:48,321 --> 00:41:50,121
The ways of Heaven, Earth, and Man

845
00:41:50,121 --> 00:41:51,041
are interconnected.

846
00:41:51,801 --> 00:41:52,640
What is Tao?

847
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,841
Tao is regularity.

848
00:41:56,801 --> 00:41:58,200
Mugwort

849
00:41:58,361 --> 00:42:00,960
can dredge the earthly meridians.

850
00:42:01,321 --> 00:42:03,601
It has the same effect on our body.

851
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,281
It can overcome resistance
and find the cause.

852
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,321
In the past,

853
00:42:10,521 --> 00:42:12,440
I thought the heat during moxibustion

854
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,240
was the element that cured illnesses.

855
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,400
I never expected it to be the smoke.

856
00:42:16,801 --> 00:42:19,361
No matter if it's the heat or smoke,

857
00:42:20,521 --> 00:42:23,841
it's beneficial to
the patient's recovery.

858
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,561
What does "beneficial" mean?

859
00:42:27,281 --> 00:42:28,321
That means it's good for you.

860
00:42:30,561 --> 00:42:31,801
If mugwort is that good,

861
00:42:31,801 --> 00:42:32,761
I have to harvest

862
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,160
more of them today.

863
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,561
After harvesting them,

864
00:42:36,561 --> 00:42:38,480
you can hang it on your door

865
00:42:38,841 --> 00:42:41,160
or take a bath with it.

866
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,640
It's good for your body.

867
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:44,761
It generates warmer Yang energy.

868
00:42:50,321 --> 00:42:51,189
Let's hurry.

869
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:00,378
(Mugwort)

870
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:05,685
(Warms the meridians, stops bleeding,
expels coldness, stops pain, and so on)

871
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:07,121
This place is amazing.

872
00:43:07,321 --> 00:43:08,121
The weather is great too.

873
00:43:08,281 --> 00:43:09,640
-Okay.
-What do you think that looks like?

874
00:43:09,801 --> 00:43:11,281
-Professor Ren.
-A huge tea plantation.

875
00:43:11,281 --> 00:43:12,218
Professor Ren.

876
00:43:13,321 --> 00:43:14,182
What's the matter?

877
00:43:15,041 --> 00:43:16,601
-I need you to do me a favour.
-What is it?

878
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:18,400
My daughter is having a high fever.

879
00:43:19,121 --> 00:43:20,480
I don't know

880
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,281
if it was because she had something bad

881
00:43:22,281 --> 00:43:23,081
or caught a cold.

882
00:43:23,081 --> 00:43:24,640
I just gave her fever medicine
this morning.

883
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:25,801
But now, she's feverish again.

884
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,720
Professor Ren,
please give her a diagnosis.

885
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,582
Calm down.

886
00:43:30,281 --> 00:43:31,601
Mr Zheng, don't be anxious.

887
00:43:32,761 --> 00:43:34,720
There's no need to be anxious
when your child has a fever.

888
00:43:35,411 --> 00:43:36,217
Look.

889
00:43:36,321 --> 00:43:38,041
We have all the physicians
in the world here.

890
00:43:38,361 --> 00:43:39,240
Yeah, Mr Zheng.

891
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:42,121
It's common for children to catch a cold

892
00:43:42,321 --> 00:43:43,400
or have a fever.

893
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,121
We TCM practitioners have been
studying this topic

894
00:43:45,121 --> 00:43:46,561
for millenniums.

895
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:48,321
Let me recommend someone to you.

896
00:43:49,321 --> 00:43:50,720
What about the son
of Professor Ren, Tian Zhen?

897
00:43:53,316 --> 00:43:54,975
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

898
00:43:55,038 --> 00:43:56,466
(are referenced from relevant
traditional Chinese medicine books)

899
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,101
(Do not use without medical advice)
(End of Episode 10)
