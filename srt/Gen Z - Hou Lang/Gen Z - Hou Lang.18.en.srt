4
00:01:39,787 --> 00:01:40,587
Mr Liu,

5
00:01:40,787 --> 00:01:42,827
it is normal and very positive

6
00:01:42,907 --> 00:01:44,547
for young people to pursue their dreams.

7
00:01:44,627 --> 00:01:46,066
But if you want to hide

8
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,225
and obtain this certificate
just because of that,

9
00:01:48,306 --> 00:01:49,426
I don't think it's worth it.

10
00:01:49,547 --> 00:01:50,427
Look at

11
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,073
how hard he's practising dancing now,

12
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,625
there's a good chance he will win
awards, and even become a champion.

13
00:01:54,706 --> 00:01:56,226
Once this kind of thing is uncovered,

14
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:58,386
so many eyes will be on him,

15
00:01:58,466 --> 00:01:59,266
criticizing him.

16
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,947
It will be too late to regret it then.

17
00:02:01,027 --> 00:02:03,340
You know what will happen?
It will ruin his public image.

18
00:02:03,633 --> 00:02:04,434
It's very serious.

19
00:02:04,566 --> 00:02:05,366
Liu,

20
00:02:06,066 --> 00:02:08,267
Tou Tou made a very good point.

21
00:02:08,347 --> 00:02:09,147
Tou Tou,

22
00:02:09,286 --> 00:02:11,245
I'm really impressed.

23
00:02:11,441 --> 00:02:12,706
Liu, sit down.

24
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,507
Let's do what Tou Tou said, okay?

25
00:02:17,987 --> 00:02:20,146
I know you have helped me a lot.

26
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,707
I will find another way to repay you,

27
00:02:23,147 --> 00:02:25,066
but I can't do

28
00:02:25,146 --> 00:02:26,507
what you asked of me today.

29
00:02:27,193 --> 00:02:29,394
Because this concerns
your child's entire life.

30
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,200
We need to proceed with caution.

31
00:02:32,586 --> 00:02:33,386
Don't you think so?

32
00:02:35,586 --> 00:02:36,646
You are right, Professor.

33
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,812
I will listen to you.

34
00:02:38,646 --> 00:02:39,767
What about me?

35
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,380
I said a lot just now.

36
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,480
I...

37
00:02:42,632 --> 00:02:43,753
You were right too.

38
00:02:44,266 --> 00:02:45,306
Let's be clear.

39
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,099
You chose this path,

40
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,773
so you'd better see it through the end.

41
00:02:49,854 --> 00:02:51,587
Don't worry about it, Dad.

42
00:02:53,946 --> 00:02:56,307
Well, I guess it's settled then.

43
00:02:56,387 --> 00:02:59,226
I heard that Ms Dong is practising
in your clinic.

44
00:02:59,866 --> 00:03:02,667
You know that I have issues
with my neck and lumbar spine.

45
00:03:03,427 --> 00:03:04,827
Could you please introduce me to her?

46
00:03:04,866 --> 00:03:06,506
It's my duty to help.

47
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,341
-Okay.
-I'll take you there right now.

48
00:03:08,726 --> 00:03:10,066
-Thank you.
-All right.

49
00:03:12,586 --> 00:03:13,866
He's really worrying.

50
00:03:13,946 --> 00:03:15,147
Yes, yes,

51
00:03:16,506 --> 00:03:18,107
but we can't just leave him be.

52
00:03:25,707 --> 00:03:28,067
You're wearing so many clothes.

53
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,653
Aren't you feeling uncomfortably hot?

54
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,121
-So old-fashioned.
-What did you say?

55
00:03:39,987 --> 00:03:41,707
Little brat.

56
00:03:42,186 --> 00:03:43,746
You are so smug.

57
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,160
Help!

58
00:04:36,821 --> 00:04:37,901
Help!

59
00:04:40,106 --> 00:04:41,106
Help!

60
00:04:42,147 --> 00:04:43,266
Anyone there?

61
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,400
What's wrong?

62
00:04:45,826 --> 00:04:46,626
What's wrong?

63
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,627
My baby...

64
00:04:50,147 --> 00:04:51,826
-Your water broke.
-My baby...

65
00:04:51,906 --> 00:04:52,867
You're going into labour.

66
00:04:53,067 --> 00:04:55,041
Hold on. You need to relax.
Come, come.

67
00:04:55,106 --> 00:04:56,347
Stretch your legs out. Relax.

68
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:57,826
Listen to me, do as I say.

69
00:04:57,906 --> 00:04:58,987
I'm here. You will be fine.

70
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,200
It's you!

71
00:05:01,186 --> 00:05:01,986
Oh, my God!

72
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,640
I can't believe I would even run
into a jinx like you in the cemetery.

73
00:05:07,719 --> 00:05:08,839
Don't touch me!

(Qibo Medical Centre)

75
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,561
When I ignored you,

76
00:05:17,987 --> 00:05:19,586
you flourished.

77
00:05:21,003 --> 00:05:23,666
Now that I'm taking such
meticulous care of you every day.

78
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,240
Yet how did you end up
looking like this?

79
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:28,826
Did you see my phone?

80
00:05:29,626 --> 00:05:30,867
-Pardon me?
-My phone?

81
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,520
I didn't see it.

82
00:05:36,514 --> 00:05:37,394
Master.

83
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,440
What's the matter?

84
00:05:40,746 --> 00:05:41,667
Jian Xi is here.

85
00:05:43,546 --> 00:05:45,787
Cursing me now won't help you, you know?

86
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,400
Your baby is
the most important thing now.

87
00:05:47,466 --> 00:05:48,867
You hear me? It's your baby.

88
00:05:48,947 --> 00:05:50,067
Trust me.

89
00:05:50,227 --> 00:05:51,546
I'm a doctor.

90
00:05:51,707 --> 00:05:52,866
Straighten your legs.

91
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,880
Oh, God.

92
00:05:54,266 --> 00:05:56,187
I'm not going to die here, am I?

93
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,440
You won't die. You're just giving birth.

94
00:05:59,627 --> 00:06:00,826
Our whole family

95
00:06:01,506 --> 00:06:03,466
is going to die in your hands.

96
00:06:03,546 --> 00:06:04,746
-Come.
-No...

97
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,920
You mustn't get agitated.

98
00:06:06,027 --> 00:06:07,980
You have to conserve your strength,
you hear me?

99
00:06:08,346 --> 00:06:10,507
You have to conserve your strength
to push, okay?

100
00:06:10,587 --> 00:06:12,787
I'm calling an ambulance
for you now, okay?

101
00:06:12,867 --> 00:06:14,386
Hang in there, you hear me?

102
00:06:16,346 --> 00:06:17,146
No.

103
00:06:17,826 --> 00:06:20,226
Even if you call an ambulance,

104
00:06:20,707 --> 00:06:22,226
we're deep in the mountains,

105
00:06:22,946 --> 00:06:25,786
by the time the ambulance arrives,
I'll be dead already.

106

107
00:06:28,226 --> 00:06:29,106

Hello? Is this the first aid centre?

110
00:06:33,546 --> 00:06:35,707
I'm at Mushan Cemetery.

111
00:06:35,907 --> 00:06:37,266
I'm on a path.

112
00:06:37,506 --> 00:06:40,307
A woman is going into labour here.

113
00:06:40,427 --> 00:06:41,666
Can you guys come now?

114
00:06:41,747 --> 00:06:42,547
Don't leave.

115
00:06:42,707 --> 00:06:44,347
Don't go. Save my baby.

116
00:06:44,427 --> 00:06:46,507
-I'm not leaving, I'm not leaving.
-Save my baby!

117
00:06:46,587 --> 00:06:48,146
Hold on. I need to find a landmark.

118
00:06:48,226 --> 00:06:49,866
Hello? There is no landmark here.

119
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,920
Can you come right now?

120
00:06:50,987 --> 00:06:52,106
It's an emergency.

121
00:06:54,606 --> 00:06:55,406
Okay, okay.

122
00:06:56,243 --> 00:06:57,066
What's wrong?

123
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:58,466
I'm feeling...

124
00:06:59,506 --> 00:07:00,306
I'm feeling...

125
00:07:00,826 --> 00:07:02,546
I'm feeling that he's coming out.

126
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,760
Hang on.

127
00:07:04,546 --> 00:07:05,467
He's coming out.

128
00:07:06,867 --> 00:07:08,146
Here. Sit here.

129
00:07:08,226 --> 00:07:09,026
Relax.

130
00:07:09,106 --> 00:07:09,906
Take a deep breath.

131
00:07:10,066 --> 00:07:10,946
Take a deep breath.

132
00:07:11,066 --> 00:07:12,106
Don't worry. I'm here.

133
00:07:12,987 --> 00:07:14,866
Chen Hui, hang in there. Chen Hui!

134
00:07:14,946 --> 00:07:15,987
I can't.

135
00:07:16,386 --> 00:07:17,946
I'm here. Don't worry.

137

Jian Xi,

138
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,546
why have you lost so much weight?

139
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:34,892
Didn't she take the medicine
prescribed last time?

140
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:35,926
She did.

141
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:37,239
It has no effect at all.

142
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,760
Now she eats even less.

143
00:07:38,826 --> 00:07:40,667
Lately, she won't even
take a bite of food.

144
00:07:40,747 --> 00:07:43,147
Could her injury have caused
some other illness?

145
00:07:52,627 --> 00:07:54,666
How about this? You guys go out first.

146
00:07:55,226 --> 00:07:57,027
I'd like a moment alone with Jian Xi.

147

Professor Ren,

148
00:07:59,427 --> 00:08:00,506
what's wrong with Jian Xi?

149
00:08:00,666 --> 00:08:02,066
Is it serious?

150
00:08:03,867 --> 00:08:05,307
I think

151
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:06,660
she's fine.

152
00:08:07,133 --> 00:08:08,746
How can she be fine?

153
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,961
She won't even

154
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,199
eat now.

155
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,800
Just tell me the truth.

156
00:08:13,867 --> 00:08:14,867
I can handle it.

157
00:08:18,101 --> 00:08:19,474
You need to trust Professor Ren.

158
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,240
If he says it's nothing serious,

159
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:23,925
then there shouldn't be any problem.

160
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,146
Let's step outside for a moment, okay?

161
00:08:26,546 --> 00:08:27,346
Plus,

162
00:08:27,627 --> 00:08:28,666
Jian Xi will feel nervous

163
00:08:29,466 --> 00:08:30,707

Give me your phone.

Forget about me.

00:09:15,386 --> 00:09:16,786
Tear it open for me.

174
00:09:17,066 --> 00:09:18,467
Protect my baby.

175

-When?
-An hour.

40 minutes.

-40 minutes?
-Yes, yes.

I've also called
the village doctor here.

184

It's okay. He'll be here soon.
Hang in there.

185
00:09:35,627 --> 00:09:37,426
I'll be dead already.

186
00:09:37,506 --> 00:09:38,506
You won't.

187
00:09:38,627 --> 00:09:40,907
My baby will also be dead already.

188
00:09:41,506 --> 00:09:43,946
We will both die here.

189
00:09:45,147 --> 00:09:45,947
Mr Ren.

190
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,107
No.

191
00:09:48,506 --> 00:09:49,506
I have to go see him.

192
00:09:50,216 --> 00:09:51,212
Tear it open for me.

193
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,719
Take my baby out.

194
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,800
Save him.

195
00:09:54,826 --> 00:09:56,066
If it's a boy,

196
00:09:56,747 --> 00:09:57,547
name him...

197
00:09:57,826 --> 00:09:59,467
Name him Kong Nian Yuan.

198
00:09:59,946 --> 00:10:02,946
If it's a girl, name her Kong Ai Yuan.

199
00:10:03,266 --> 00:10:04,839
-Can you remember it?
-Okay, okay. I got it.

200
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,159
-Can you remember it?
-I got it.

201
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,760
You will be fine, Chen Hui.

202
00:10:09,507 --> 00:10:10,346
Hang in there!

203
00:10:10,466 --> 00:10:12,146
Chen Hui, hang in there!
Don't...

204
00:10:12,267 --> 00:10:13,627
When will the ambulance get here?

205
00:10:15,387 --> 00:10:17,187
You killed my husband.

206
00:10:27,267 --> 00:10:28,346
Why...

207
00:10:28,466 --> 00:10:30,627
Why didn't you save him?

208
00:10:31,466 --> 00:10:32,466
(You must cherish)

209
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,000
(your time here.)

210
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:36,747
Don't wait until you encounter patients

211
00:10:37,346 --> 00:10:38,627
or unexpected events

212
00:10:38,747 --> 00:10:39,907
and find yourself helpless,

213
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:41,506
only then you regret for

214
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,427
not having learned

215
00:10:43,507 --> 00:10:45,586
a useful skill here.

216
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:48,187
I'm the devil. Look at me, Chen Hui.

217
00:10:48,267 --> 00:10:49,187
I'm the devil.

218
00:10:49,267 --> 00:10:50,627
So, you have to hang in there.

219
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:52,506
You haven't settled
the score with me yet.

220
00:10:52,586 --> 00:10:54,066
You have to come after me, you know?

221
00:10:54,146 --> 00:10:55,227
You have to stay alive.

222
00:10:55,307 --> 00:10:56,747
Do you hear me, Chen Hui?

223
00:10:57,706 --> 00:10:59,427
-Chen Hui?
-Help me.

224
00:10:59,507 --> 00:11:00,586
I'll help you, I will.

225
00:11:00,706 --> 00:11:01,706
Stay with me, Chen Hui.

226
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,826
Chen Hui, hang in there! Chen Hui!

227
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,120
Your pulse is weak,

228
00:11:21,027 --> 00:11:22,426
but it isn't a big issue.

229
00:11:25,067 --> 00:11:26,387
Be honest with me,

230
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:28,827
have you

231
00:11:29,593 --> 00:11:30,633
stopped eating?

232
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,400
There is no such thing as using tiles
as medicine, is there?

233
00:11:37,147 --> 00:11:39,627
I'll never be able to walk again,

234
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,441
will I?

235
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:48,554
You've been lying to me,

236
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,560
haven't you?

237
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,360
Chen Hui.

238
00:12:29,672 --> 00:12:30,953
Chen Hui, listen to me,

239
00:12:31,627 --> 00:12:33,507
the ambulance is on its way,

240
00:12:33,906 --> 00:12:35,267
but we can't wait anymore.

241
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:37,266
I will help you deliver, okay?

242
00:12:37,346 --> 00:12:38,706
Just do as I say.

243
00:12:38,786 --> 00:12:39,747
We will push together.

244
00:12:39,827 --> 00:12:41,107
You and your baby will be fine,

245
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,280
okay? Trust me.

246
00:12:42,706 --> 00:12:44,267
Save my baby.

247
00:12:49,827 --> 00:12:51,146
My baby...

248
00:13:10,987 --> 00:13:12,573
Your baby is in an incorrect position.

249
00:13:13,466 --> 00:13:14,827
He is not head-down.

250
00:13:16,747 --> 00:13:17,586
What should I do?

251
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,319
Save my baby first.

252
00:13:22,387 --> 00:13:24,146
You have to save my baby first.

253
00:13:24,226 --> 00:13:25,547
I... I'm going

254
00:13:25,627 --> 00:13:26,987
to reach in now

255
00:13:27,067 --> 00:13:28,506
and try to...

256
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,160
Try to turn the baby's head downward.

257
00:13:30,827 --> 00:13:32,666
He will be fine. He will be fine, okay?

258
00:13:33,267 --> 00:13:34,627
Trust me. He will be fine.

259
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,479
Hang in there.
I'm about to reach the baby's head.

260
00:13:55,827 --> 00:13:56,627
I reached it.

261
00:13:58,187 --> 00:13:59,347
Hang in there, Chen Hui.

262
00:13:59,427 --> 00:14:00,227
Hang in there.

263
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,240
Can you feel my hand?

264
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,319
-Yes.
-Relax now.

265
00:14:10,466 --> 00:14:11,547
Okay. It's okay now.

266
00:14:12,947 --> 00:14:13,747
Chen Hui,

267
00:14:14,067 --> 00:14:15,427
now listen to my instructions.

268
00:14:15,507 --> 00:14:16,466
I will count to three,

269
00:14:16,546 --> 00:14:17,387
and then you push.

270
00:14:17,586 --> 00:14:18,947
Push with all your strength.

271
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:20,666
Come on. One, two, three.

272
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:22,466
Push!

273
00:14:27,187 --> 00:14:28,507
Okay. Try again.

274
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,399
Can you push again?

275
00:14:34,387 --> 00:14:35,187
I can't.

276
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:36,187
I can't push anymore.

277
00:14:36,226 --> 00:14:37,667
-You can do it, Chen Hui.
-I can't.

278
00:14:37,747 --> 00:14:39,799
You can do it, Chen Hui.
We are almost there.

279
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,320
You have to hang in there, Chen Hui.

280
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:43,627
Let's try to push again, okay?

281
00:14:43,827 --> 00:14:44,627
Let's try it again.

282
00:14:44,947 --> 00:14:47,506
One, two, three!

283
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:48,586
Push!

284
00:15:28,466 --> 00:15:30,827
Jian Xi, I'll be honest with you.

285
00:15:33,067 --> 00:15:34,466
I have never encountered

286
00:15:35,154 --> 00:15:37,633
this particular medical case before.

287
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,187
However, there are records
in ancient books

288
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,200
and even in my master's

289
00:15:43,267 --> 00:15:44,346
secret teachings.

290
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,059
If we consider TCM
as an experiential medicine,

291
00:15:48,947 --> 00:15:50,466
it means that there were

292
00:15:50,994 --> 00:15:53,234
successful treatments
for this case in the past.

293
00:15:55,586 --> 00:15:56,947
Your condition is severe.

294
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,880
It will take time to recover.

295
00:16:00,547 --> 00:16:02,427
Look, we all care about you

296
00:16:02,507 --> 00:16:03,507
and support you.

297
00:16:03,627 --> 00:16:05,867
Your mother hasn't given up on trying

298
00:16:06,146 --> 00:16:07,546
every possible treatment for you.

299
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:10,347
If you give up on yourself,

300
00:16:11,507 --> 00:16:13,546
then there truly is no hope left.

301
00:16:17,026 --> 00:16:18,586
You see, throughout my journey,

302
00:16:19,827 --> 00:16:22,987
I have been following the methods
of the ancient sages

303
00:16:23,067 --> 00:16:24,947
to treat illnesses and save lives.

304
00:16:25,146 --> 00:16:26,427
My faith in them

305
00:16:29,067 --> 00:16:30,067
tells me that

306
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,680
the ancients were right
about many things.

307
00:16:33,466 --> 00:16:34,266
And you...

308
00:16:34,507 --> 00:16:35,307
How about this?

309
00:16:36,706 --> 00:16:37,627
Give me some time.

310
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,001
Give yourself some time.

311
00:16:40,346 --> 00:16:41,726
Let's work hard on this together.

312
00:16:41,906 --> 00:16:42,706
What do you say?

313
00:16:44,706 --> 00:16:46,226
What if it doesn't work?

314
00:16:47,466 --> 00:16:49,226
What if we can't find the tiles?

315
00:16:50,199 --> 00:16:52,706
What if we find the tiles
but it still doesn't work?

316
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:57,947
Will I be trapped in a wheelchair
for the rest of my life?

317
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,681
Jian Xi, you need to understand

318
00:17:10,346 --> 00:17:12,346
that your life is not just yours alone.

319
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:14,507
You have your mother,

320
00:17:15,627 --> 00:17:16,507
Professor Song,

321
00:17:17,466 --> 00:17:18,706
and me.

322
00:17:19,627 --> 00:17:21,466
If we try and succeed,

323
00:17:22,146 --> 00:17:24,026
each of us will gain strength

324
00:17:24,346 --> 00:17:25,747
in our hearts.

325
00:17:26,387 --> 00:17:27,666
It would be a shame

326
00:17:28,314 --> 00:17:29,434
to give up without trying,

327
00:17:31,507 --> 00:17:32,706
wouldn't it?

328
00:17:40,187 --> 00:17:41,827
But what if it doesn't work?

329
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:47,307
If it doesn't work,

330
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,520
whatever you decide to do,

331
00:17:50,827 --> 00:17:51,987
I won't stop you.

332
00:17:59,267 --> 00:18:00,067
Fine.

333
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:04,226
I'll give it one last try.

334
00:18:05,987 --> 00:18:07,427
If it doesn't work,

335
00:18:08,627 --> 00:18:10,346
whatever I want to do,
you can't stop me.

336
00:18:13,947 --> 00:18:14,747
Okay.

337
00:18:19,226 --> 00:18:20,106
It's a boy.

338
00:18:20,387 --> 00:18:21,187
Look.

339
00:18:24,867 --> 00:18:26,627
-Good job.
-Thank you.

340
00:18:27,827 --> 00:18:28,907
Thank you.

341
00:18:28,987 --> 00:18:29,787
Good job.

342
00:18:30,466 --> 00:18:31,867
Thank you.

343
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:39,667
Chen Hui?

344
00:18:40,987 --> 00:18:42,867
Chen Hui, hang in there.

345
00:18:43,586 --> 00:18:45,067
Don't sleep, Chen Hui.

346
00:18:45,226 --> 00:18:46,026
Chen Hui,

347
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:48,226
-hang in there.
-Anyone here?

348
00:18:48,306 --> 00:18:49,466
Where are you?

349
00:18:49,946 --> 00:18:50,746
Anyone here?

350
00:18:52,507 --> 00:18:53,307
Anyone here?

351
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:54,866
We are here!

352
00:18:56,586 --> 00:18:59,507
-There is someone there.
-We are here!

353
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,956
(Ling Lan)

354
00:19:38,226 --> 00:19:39,066
Professor Ren,

355
00:19:39,987 --> 00:19:40,987
you are right.

356
00:19:41,946 --> 00:19:42,980
As long as we have faith,

357
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,440
we can create miracle.

358
00:19:46,706 --> 00:19:47,627
The other day,

359
00:19:48,027 --> 00:19:50,586
I saw a news report on TV.

360
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,865
It was about a paralysed patient
with high-level spinal cord injury

361
00:19:53,946 --> 00:19:55,627
who managed to stand up

362
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:57,159
thanks to a massage technique.

363
00:20:00,826 --> 00:20:01,626
Jian Xi,

364
00:20:02,466 --> 00:20:03,747
you have to believe in me,

365
00:20:04,267 --> 00:20:05,627
believe in Professor Ren.

366
00:20:06,226 --> 00:20:07,026
I mean,

367
00:20:07,346 --> 00:20:09,507
there are so many methods in this world,

368
00:20:09,867 --> 00:20:10,667
right?

369
00:20:10,826 --> 00:20:12,627
Even if the tiles don't work,

370
00:20:13,327 --> 00:20:14,366
that's okay.

371
00:20:14,867 --> 00:20:15,987
As long as there is...

372
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,245
There is even just
a glimmer of possibility,

373
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,680
I will put in my utmost effort.

374
00:20:22,567 --> 00:20:24,087
You will stand up.

375
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,280
Mr Ren.

376
00:20:29,867 --> 00:20:31,427
Mr Ren, hurry.

377
00:20:33,627 --> 00:20:34,627
It's Ms Yang's call.

378
00:20:35,346 --> 00:20:36,266
What's so urgent?

379
00:20:36,346 --> 00:20:37,579
She has called you many times.

380
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,320
Hello?

381
00:20:41,226 --> 00:20:42,026
Hello?

382
00:20:44,346 --> 00:20:45,146
Master...

383
00:20:46,867 --> 00:20:48,387
Master, I've learned it.

384
00:20:49,226 --> 00:20:50,026
What?

385
00:20:50,987 --> 00:20:52,346
I've learned the lesson of life.

386
00:20:56,066 --> 00:20:57,586
I've learned, Master.

387
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,081
Thank you.

388
00:21:18,346 --> 00:21:19,146
Jian Xi,

389
00:21:19,706 --> 00:21:20,506
I hope

390
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,440
that you would have faith like we do.

391
00:21:24,913 --> 00:21:26,193
Let's work together

392
00:21:26,867 --> 00:21:27,667
to fight against

393
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,481
the illness.

394
00:21:30,987 --> 00:21:32,507
We can't let it defeat us.

395
00:21:52,387 --> 00:21:54,747
Ms Yang and Chen Hui

396
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:57,321
sure have an interesting relationship.

397
00:21:58,963 --> 00:21:59,787
Speaking of which,

398
00:21:59,987 --> 00:22:01,267
Yang Xiao Hong's operation

399
00:22:01,627 --> 00:22:03,387
stepped on the line today.

400
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,400
You have to lecture her.

401
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,667
They called me
after they arrived at the hospital.

402
00:22:07,747 --> 00:22:09,267
I have already reprimanded them.

403
00:22:09,987 --> 00:22:11,427
It's not allowed

404
00:22:11,507 --> 00:22:13,066
to perform medical procedures

405
00:22:13,293 --> 00:22:14,614
without a professional present.

406
00:22:15,226 --> 00:22:17,592
Even though it was an accident,
there won't be a next time.

407
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,601
It will never happen again
in this lifetime.

408
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:24,132
Life truly is a miracle.

409
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,280
Are you donating this set too?

410
00:22:33,199 --> 00:22:33,999
Yes.

411
00:22:35,166 --> 00:22:36,807
These...

412
00:22:37,346 --> 00:22:38,787
We bought this with money.

413
00:22:38,867 --> 00:22:39,987
It cost quite a bit.

414
00:22:40,454 --> 00:22:41,974
Can't we keep them for our grandson?

415
00:22:42,453 --> 00:22:44,599
In pursuit of knowledge,
every day something is added.

416
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,600
In the practice of the Tao,
every day something is dropped.

417
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,279
I'm dropping more and more

418
00:22:49,306 --> 00:22:50,906
for the sake of Tao now.

419
00:22:51,425 --> 00:22:53,145
I'm donating these books to students

420
00:22:53,226 --> 00:22:54,547
who are pursuing knowledge.

421
00:22:54,627 --> 00:22:55,647
Isn't it a great thing?

422
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:56,840
Yes.

423
00:22:57,947 --> 00:22:59,180
Then, why is it always me

424
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,560
who suffers while you drop things?

425
00:23:01,627 --> 00:23:02,667
You want to donate these,

426
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,720
and I'm the one who is
helping you pack them up.

427
00:23:04,793 --> 00:23:06,226
When you were pursuing knowledge,

428
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,120
I was the one who carried your
books back and organized them for you.

429
00:23:09,165 --> 00:23:10,364
That's why people say

430
00:23:10,747 --> 00:23:12,076
the most profound embodiment
of Yin and Yang

431
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,504
can be witnessed
within a married couple.

432
00:23:13,707 --> 00:23:15,146
Once I achieve enlightenment,

433
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,093
I'll take you to ascend to heaven.

434
00:23:17,586 --> 00:23:19,226
Do you think I'm just an ordinary being?

435
00:23:20,747 --> 00:23:22,180
You're even worse than
an ordinary being.

436
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,320
You never listen.

437
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,600
No, no.

438
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:29,746
You are different from
an ordinary being.

439
00:23:31,106 --> 00:23:32,106
I listen to you.

440
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,280
Scram.

441
00:23:35,507 --> 00:23:36,307
Give it to me.

442
00:23:36,987 --> 00:23:38,506
-Did I injure you?
-You broke my arm.

443
00:23:39,346 --> 00:23:40,627
Stop acting.

444
00:23:45,226 --> 00:23:46,026
All right now.

445
00:23:47,226 --> 00:23:48,787
Stop sighing.

446
00:23:48,867 --> 00:23:50,626
This is life.

447
00:23:50,706 --> 00:23:52,066
Seasons change,

448
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:53,840
it's the norm.

449
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,960
If people listen to you,
then there would be no one working.

450
00:23:57,033 --> 00:23:57,873
Do you know

451
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,400
how many things need to be done
during the Spring Festival?

452
00:24:00,747 --> 00:24:02,426
Spring cleaning takes two to three days,

453
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,760
preparing food and shopping
takes three to five days.

454
00:24:05,826 --> 00:24:08,387
We need to to prepare gifts
and red envelopes

455
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:10,867
for relatives and children.

456
00:24:11,106 --> 00:24:13,066
We also need to visit
teachers and friends.

457
00:24:14,747 --> 00:24:15,547
Speaking of which,

458
00:24:15,826 --> 00:24:17,579
what are you going to do

459
00:24:18,867 --> 00:24:19,787
about the girls

460
00:24:19,867 --> 00:24:21,226
for this year's Spring Festival?

461
00:24:23,987 --> 00:24:25,506
Your son has talked about that.

462
00:24:25,586 --> 00:24:27,187
He said Meng Meng's parents

463
00:24:27,267 --> 00:24:28,706
are planning to take her abroad

464
00:24:30,106 --> 00:24:31,787
to visit museums

465
00:24:31,867 --> 00:24:32,867
and amusement parks.

466
00:24:34,507 --> 00:24:35,507
Tou Tou

467
00:24:36,586 --> 00:24:38,146
doesn't have parents or a home,

468
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:39,747
so her master

469
00:24:40,066 --> 00:24:41,226
is her family.

470
00:24:42,267 --> 00:24:43,946
Let's consider

471
00:24:44,106 --> 00:24:45,867
Tou Tou as our second child.

472
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:49,000
The problem is I can't.

473
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:51,793
Tou Tou has been doing well lately.

474
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,600
She used to cause trouble for you,

475
00:24:54,973 --> 00:24:56,853
but now she is helping you
with the chores.

476
00:24:57,073 --> 00:24:58,512
Yes, I admit that

477
00:24:59,326 --> 00:25:01,326
she has made
significant progress recently,

478
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,193
but she had accumulated
too many negative points before.

479
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,761
Even with great progress,

480
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,400
she hasn't fully redeemed herself yet.

481
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,699
It's only you

482
00:25:09,266 --> 00:25:11,506
who can consider everyone as one family.

483
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,319
I don't have that kind of mindset.

484
00:25:15,106 --> 00:25:16,386
I fight alone

485
00:25:16,466 --> 00:25:17,586
and do the work by myself.

486
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,359
I really wish one day

487
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,959
I could let go of all responsibilities,

488
00:25:24,133 --> 00:25:25,413
relax,

489
00:25:26,539 --> 00:25:27,659
take leave,

490
00:25:27,747 --> 00:25:28,547
and have some rest.

491
00:25:28,627 --> 00:25:29,427
All right,

492
00:25:29,826 --> 00:25:31,526
you can take time off
this Spring Festival.

493
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,026
I'll take care of everything.

494
00:25:36,066 --> 00:25:37,106
You?

495
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,120
Did the sun rise from...

496
00:26:20,946 --> 00:26:21,867
The west today?

497
00:26:28,867 --> 00:26:29,667
Don't move.

498
00:26:29,956 --> 00:26:31,079
Don't move. Just stay there.

499
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,000
Ling Lan?

500
00:26:32,913 --> 00:26:33,986
How did you fall?

501
00:26:34,066 --> 00:26:35,867
I'm fine. Mum, I'm greeting you.

502
00:26:37,226 --> 00:26:39,266
Be careful.
The steps are covered in water.

503
00:26:39,346 --> 00:26:40,866
Come, slowly.

504
00:26:42,346 --> 00:26:43,146
Are you okay?

505
00:26:43,747 --> 00:26:44,867
Move around.

506
00:26:46,987 --> 00:26:47,787
My butt hurts.

507
00:26:48,387 --> 00:26:49,946
I'm fine, I'm okay.

508
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,622
-Unbelievable.
-Fortunately, I cultivate everyday.

509
00:26:52,703 --> 00:26:54,826
Turns out that
it was all for this moment.

510
00:26:56,427 --> 00:26:58,466
Did you order Xin Zheng
to mop the floor?

511
00:26:58,627 --> 00:27:00,907
-I didn't.
-You just brought trouble to yourself.

512
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,506
Xin Zheng, put the mop down.

513
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,921
Go and read in the study.

514
00:27:04,466 --> 00:27:05,787
No, Mum.

515
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,320
He rarely takes the initiative
to do household chores.

516
00:27:08,693 --> 00:27:09,493
Mr Ren,

517
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,160
keep up the good work.

518
00:27:11,333 --> 00:27:12,174
If you can

519
00:27:12,274 --> 00:27:14,266
occasionally help with household chores,

520
00:27:14,346 --> 00:27:16,266
I don't mind falling a few more times.

521
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,400
Don't say that.

522
00:27:18,466 --> 00:27:19,906
I'm really fine.
It's just that my butt hurts.

523
00:27:19,946 --> 00:27:21,547
-Stop talking nonsense.
-By the way,

524
00:27:22,226 --> 00:27:23,026
I mean,

525
00:27:23,507 --> 00:27:24,467
do you see

526
00:27:24,547 --> 00:27:25,827
the mop bucket in the yard?

527
00:27:25,907 --> 00:27:26,987
Yes. It's right there.

528
00:27:27,106 --> 00:27:29,626
Right. You need to put this mop

529
00:27:29,706 --> 00:27:31,026
on that bucket.

530
00:27:31,106 --> 00:27:32,226
And press it like this.

531
00:27:32,306 --> 00:27:33,386
Drain the water first

532
00:27:33,466 --> 00:27:34,952
-Yes, yes.
-before you mop the floor.

533
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:38,427
-Are you sure you are okay?
-Yes, yes.

534
00:27:38,507 --> 00:27:39,746
Look. Look.

535
00:27:39,878 --> 00:27:40,959
You are jumping? Stop it.

536
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:41,960
I really am fine.

537
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,320
Thank you.

538
00:27:45,867 --> 00:27:46,667
I have been

539
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,680
to the Du Fu Thatched Cottage.

540
00:27:48,747 --> 00:27:49,787
When Du Fu wrote

541
00:27:49,867 --> 00:27:51,467
"The wind howled in rage
in the eighth month during autumn,

542
00:27:51,547 --> 00:27:53,307
blowing off the thatch on my roof",

543
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,840
he was hiding in that shed
writing poetry

544
00:27:55,987 --> 00:27:57,667
while his wife was pressing thatch

545
00:27:57,827 --> 00:28:00,227
on the roof with a wooden stick.

546
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,400
Looks like those
astonishing achievements in history

547
00:28:04,499 --> 00:28:06,785
are often created by those
who don't do physical labour.

548
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,560
And now, history has

549
00:28:08,707 --> 00:28:10,827
astonishingly reappeared.

550
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:12,226
My first pupil,

551
00:28:12,747 --> 00:28:14,427
you were born with such great talent,

552
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,441
and it's not meant for menial tasks
like mopping the floor.

553
00:28:22,586 --> 00:28:24,866
-What's wrong?
-Who did this?

554
00:28:24,946 --> 00:28:25,866
What's wrong, Mum?

555
00:28:25,946 --> 00:28:28,746
These are two different fillings.

556
00:28:28,826 --> 00:28:31,106
Who mixed them together?

557
00:28:31,226 --> 00:28:32,467
-What's wrong, Mum?
-This...

558
00:28:32,867 --> 00:28:33,826
Did you do this?

559
00:28:34,346 --> 00:28:35,146
Yes.

560
00:28:36,987 --> 00:28:38,907
Mum, here's what happened.
When I entered the kitchen just now,

561
00:28:38,987 --> 00:28:40,466
there were bowls all over the place.

562
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,440
It looked messy,

563
00:28:41,526 --> 00:28:43,072
so I decided to mix them together.

564
00:28:43,214 --> 00:28:44,293
You know,

565
00:28:45,346 --> 00:28:46,866
Tian Zhen doesn't eat shrimp.

566
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,359
I have to make dumplings

567
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,920
with two different fillings.

568
00:28:50,147 --> 00:28:50,947
Mum,

569
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,427
it's not like he's allergic to shrimp.

570
00:28:53,576 --> 00:28:54,827
I think this is good.

571
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,200
-You see...
-No, it isn't.

572
00:28:57,106 --> 00:28:58,146
I spent the whole morning

573
00:28:58,226 --> 00:28:59,787
to make them.

574
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,680
Why not let men take care
of the external affairs,

575
00:29:03,747 --> 00:29:04,873
while the women
handle the domestic ones?

576
00:29:04,954 --> 00:29:07,640
You had to ask him to mop the floor
and do these chores.

577
00:29:08,226 --> 00:29:09,026
Xin Zheng,

578
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,019
go and read a book.

579
00:29:10,987 --> 00:29:11,787
You,

580
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,520
go and mop the floor.

581
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:14,960
Yes, Mum.

582
00:29:15,826 --> 00:29:16,986
-Don't be mad, Mum.
-Just go.

583
00:29:17,066 --> 00:29:18,986
Go. Give me the gloves. Give them to me.

584
00:29:19,747 --> 00:29:21,706
What should I do now?

585
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,578
(As Serene and Elegant As An Orchid)

586
00:29:39,106 --> 00:29:40,586
I'm wiping stuff.

587
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:42,346
No need to raise your legs.

588
00:29:46,907 --> 00:29:48,187
Why do you keep sighing?

589
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,840
Did you hurt your thoracic spine?

590
00:29:51,387 --> 00:29:52,407
Want me to examine you?

591
00:29:52,627 --> 00:29:53,506
I'm fine.

592
00:29:53,586 --> 00:29:54,386
No need.

593
00:29:58,106 --> 00:30:00,066
If you really don't want to do it,
I will do it.

594
00:30:00,627 --> 00:30:01,586
You can instruct me

595
00:30:01,826 --> 00:30:02,627
on the side.

596
00:30:04,139 --> 00:30:04,940
Please don't.

597
00:30:05,987 --> 00:30:07,266
If I let you do the chores,

598
00:30:07,434 --> 00:30:09,627
it's going to cause
an earthquake in our house.

599
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:13,334
Then, let Tian Zhen and Tou Tou
do it when they come home.

600
00:30:14,987 --> 00:30:16,986
They are studying.

601
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,760
We mustn't disturb them.

602
00:30:20,747 --> 00:30:21,547
You see,

603
00:30:22,173 --> 00:30:23,053
you are sighing again.

604
00:30:23,667 --> 00:30:24,946
No wonder they say

605
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,760
the way of a noble man

606
00:30:27,327 --> 00:30:29,327
starts with the handling of a marriage.

607
00:30:30,106 --> 00:30:32,312
Looks like you are about to
drop some wisdom, my wife.

608
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,640
You see,

609
00:30:34,466 --> 00:30:35,507
a person

610
00:30:36,586 --> 00:30:38,425
either becomes a monk

611
00:30:38,747 --> 00:30:40,387
or gets married,

612
00:30:40,867 --> 00:30:41,787
especially women.

613
00:30:41,867 --> 00:30:42,667
You see,

614
00:30:43,267 --> 00:30:44,226
in marriage

615
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,546
and in being a bride,

616
00:30:45,627 --> 00:30:47,887
the character "woman"
is always present, right?

617
00:30:50,985 --> 00:30:52,547
Tell me more. What do you mean?

618
00:30:54,507 --> 00:30:56,226
What I mean is,

619
00:30:56,987 --> 00:30:58,226
look at me,

620
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,720
I can take care of external matters

621
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,066
and manage the household.

622
00:31:01,147 --> 00:31:02,826
I'm such an outstanding person.

623
00:31:03,467 --> 00:31:05,747
If I didn't have a marriage

624
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,681
to challenge me,

625
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,179
then my life

626
00:31:10,586 --> 00:31:13,693
would have been uneventful.

627
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,480
No, that wouldn't be enjoyable at all.

628
00:31:17,147 --> 00:31:18,147
That's why

629
00:31:18,933 --> 00:31:20,172
I have you

630
00:31:20,726 --> 00:31:21,606
and our son.

631
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,799
You make me unwilling
to let go or move on.

632
00:31:25,147 --> 00:31:27,146
I can't get angry
or upset easily either.

633
00:31:27,439 --> 00:31:28,559
You see, you see,

634
00:31:29,426 --> 00:31:30,906
God really goes

635
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:33,747
to great lengths to help me improve.

636
00:31:38,387 --> 00:31:40,153
You're the one
who creates problems for yourself.

637
00:31:41,147 --> 00:31:43,147
What did our son and I do to offend you?

638
00:31:43,747 --> 00:31:45,147
Take cleaning for example.

639
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,680
What's the difference

640
00:31:47,747 --> 00:31:49,106
between cleaning once a year

641
00:31:49,186 --> 00:31:50,627
and cleaning every day?

642
00:31:52,267 --> 00:31:53,667
As there is nothing from the first,

643
00:31:54,747 --> 00:31:56,747
where does the dust itself collect?

644
00:31:58,507 --> 00:31:59,667
Mr Ren,

645
00:32:01,106 --> 00:32:03,706
you have a mind free from dust,

646
00:32:03,946 --> 00:32:05,106
so you see no dust.

647
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,840
I can't do it.

648
00:32:07,226 --> 00:32:08,987
I don't have your
level of enlightenment.

649
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,159
You can put on socks

650
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,679
and fall asleep immediately.

651
00:32:14,434 --> 00:32:15,667
I really want to ask you.

652
00:32:15,747 --> 00:32:17,066
How do you do it?

653
00:32:17,412 --> 00:32:18,292
When you meditate,

654
00:32:18,386 --> 00:32:19,919
your mind is free from distractions.

655
00:32:20,027 --> 00:32:22,960
When I meditate, my mind
is filled with distractions.

656
00:32:23,586 --> 00:32:24,386
You see,

657
00:32:24,987 --> 00:32:26,466
daily necessities,

658
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:29,340
prescription inspection,

659
00:32:29,587 --> 00:32:31,627
our parents and child,

660
00:32:32,946 --> 00:32:34,466
food and clothing.

661
00:32:35,567 --> 00:32:37,087
Sometimes, I wonder

662
00:32:37,354 --> 00:32:38,393
how a person's heart

663
00:32:38,987 --> 00:32:41,987
can hold so many things.

664
00:32:42,987 --> 00:32:44,627
It's remarkable.

665
00:32:45,987 --> 00:32:47,747
A person won't have to think

666
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,520
about anything when he dies.

667
00:32:50,226 --> 00:32:52,412
Is that how you want
to keep this conversation going?

668
00:32:52,826 --> 00:32:54,706
So, according to what you're saying,

669
00:32:54,867 --> 00:32:56,953
the only thing I can
look forward to is death, huh?

670
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,279
Mind your tongue.

671
00:33:05,747 --> 00:33:06,547
Tian Zhen,

672
00:33:06,946 --> 00:33:09,579
your dad will foot the bill
for this year's Spring Festival goods.

673
00:33:10,173 --> 00:33:10,973
Okay!

674
00:33:11,226 --> 00:33:12,026
Yes!

675
00:33:12,413 --> 00:33:13,653
Tou Tou, come.

676
00:33:14,987 --> 00:33:15,907
See what you want to buy.

677
00:33:15,988 --> 00:33:17,748
Since your dad is paying,

678
00:33:17,933 --> 00:33:19,892
can we double the snacks?

679
00:33:20,054 --> 00:33:21,413
Of course.

680
00:33:21,873 --> 00:33:22,673
I will order them.

681
00:33:32,867 --> 00:33:33,667
Tou Tou,

682
00:33:33,867 --> 00:33:34,667
is this enough?

683
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,440
I think it's just about enough.

684
00:33:37,507 --> 00:33:39,147
We can buy the rest in the supermarket.

685
00:33:39,706 --> 00:33:41,747
Okay. I'm going to show this to my mum.

686
00:33:42,466 --> 00:33:45,586
I'll tidy up the place first.
Then, I'll clean the study, too.

687
00:33:45,747 --> 00:33:46,987
Then, we'll go together.

688
00:33:47,106 --> 00:33:47,906
Okay.

689
00:33:50,027 --> 00:33:51,407
I will get going first. Hurry up.

690
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,160
I don't understand.

691
00:34:50,013 --> 00:34:51,132
You don't understand what?

692
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,681
Why are you lying to Jian Xi?

693
00:34:56,967 --> 00:34:57,807
Why?

694
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,201
I saw it.

695
00:35:03,566 --> 00:35:04,566
There isn't any

696
00:35:04,806 --> 00:35:07,266
miraculous remedy
or folk remedy in this notebook.

697
00:35:08,066 --> 00:35:09,907
It's just a notebook
for keeping accounts.

698
00:35:10,999 --> 00:35:12,159
Why are you lying to them?

699
00:35:13,893 --> 00:35:15,972
Their lives are miserable enough.

700
00:35:17,387 --> 00:35:19,233
Integrity is what the way
of nature requires.

701
00:35:19,533 --> 00:35:21,431
Acting with integrity is the way
to achieve self-refinement.

702
00:35:21,512 --> 00:35:22,753
Weren't these your words?

703
00:35:23,586 --> 00:35:24,547
One should not lie,

704
00:35:24,627 --> 00:35:26,266
especially someone studying TCM.

705
00:35:26,379 --> 00:35:27,900
Wasn't that also what you said?

706
00:35:28,447 --> 00:35:29,486
Yet you are lying

707
00:35:29,667 --> 00:35:30,667
to people now.

708
00:35:31,667 --> 00:35:32,467
Why?

709
00:35:39,066 --> 00:35:40,946
Tell me, why?

710
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,660
Why are you lying to Jian Xi?

711
00:35:45,827 --> 00:35:47,866
You're killing me here. Tell me already!

712
00:35:55,906 --> 00:35:56,706
Tou Tou,

713
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,279
what is a doctor?

714
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,121
The most important thing for a doctor

715
00:36:05,347 --> 00:36:06,426
is compassion.

716
00:36:08,987 --> 00:36:09,585
(Compassion)

717
00:36:09,666 --> 00:36:11,386
Heaven has the virtue of nurturing life.

718
00:36:12,067 --> 00:36:13,380
I believe that the ancient sages

719
00:36:13,627 --> 00:36:16,160
would not punish me

720
00:36:16,626 --> 00:36:18,747
for wholeheartedly
attending to my patients.

721
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,959
If there were truly
any punishments for me,

722
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,093
as long as it means that

723
00:36:24,347 --> 00:36:26,067
Jian Xi,

724
00:36:26,773 --> 00:36:27,574
her mother,

725
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:28,614
and Cheng Ying

726
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,780
can escape this calamity,

727
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:30,860
I would accept it.

728
00:36:34,706 --> 00:36:36,626
Actually, when I told this big lie,

729
00:36:37,006 --> 00:36:38,486
it wasn't just for one person,

730
00:36:39,827 --> 00:36:42,226
but for the lives of a group of people.

731
00:36:43,186 --> 00:36:44,107
Lives, you know?

732
00:36:45,906 --> 00:36:46,706
Doctor.

733
00:36:49,267 --> 00:36:50,706
They call me a doctor.

734
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,321
I should bear

735
00:36:53,706 --> 00:36:55,067
some responsibility for them,

736
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,920
especially since they even

737
00:36:58,139 --> 00:36:59,500
paid for the consultation.

738
00:37:00,906 --> 00:37:02,412
She didn't pay any consultation fee.

739
00:37:02,666 --> 00:37:03,987
It's you who paid them a salary.

740
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,459
Most of them have paid
the consultation fee.

741
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:07,821
Jian Xi's mother

742
00:37:08,347 --> 00:37:09,199
hasn't even started working yet.

743
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,760
No, that's not
what I want to talk about.

744
00:37:10,827 --> 00:37:13,146
I'm asking you
why you're lying to them.

745
00:37:23,146 --> 00:37:23,946
Tou Tou,

746
00:37:24,626 --> 00:37:27,146
do you know how much Jian Xi weighs now?

747
00:37:29,626 --> 00:37:30,426
No.

748
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,880
She's losing weights.

749
00:37:32,874 --> 00:37:34,474
She probably weighs no more than 40kg.

750
00:37:36,146 --> 00:37:38,507
Apart from her legs
not being able to move,

751
00:37:38,866 --> 00:37:40,466
she is fine in other aspects.

752
00:37:40,946 --> 00:37:42,146
If I were to tell her now

753
00:37:42,226 --> 00:37:43,707
that her illness could not be cured,

754
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,239
I'm sure

755
00:37:48,027 --> 00:37:49,400
she wouldn't want to live anymore.

756
00:37:50,507 --> 00:37:52,027
And if she doesn't want to live,

757
00:37:52,107 --> 00:37:53,546
her mother definitely

758
00:37:53,626 --> 00:37:54,846
won't want to live either.

759
00:37:55,146 --> 00:37:56,267
How would Cheng Ying

760
00:37:56,347 --> 00:37:57,706
live her life then?

761
00:38:07,626 --> 00:38:08,747
Even so,

762
00:38:10,666 --> 00:38:12,466
we can't keep lying to her forever.

763
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,641
Sometimes, I keep pondering

764
00:38:17,186 --> 00:38:19,666
about the purpose of

765
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,240
a doctor's existence.

766
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,172
How much help

767
00:38:23,253 --> 00:38:24,854
can we really provide to patients?

768
00:38:25,406 --> 00:38:27,685
Sometimes, it's just
a lack of faith in oneself.

769
00:38:29,067 --> 00:38:30,067
If we have faith,

770
00:38:33,626 --> 00:38:34,987
everything should turn out fine.

771
00:38:39,747 --> 00:38:40,827
I constantly think to myself,

772
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,161
if I say that I am a good doctor,

773
00:38:44,626 --> 00:38:46,906
I must strive in that direction.

774
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,759
If I say that you are a good doctor

775
00:38:49,939 --> 00:38:51,025
and you don't believe it,

776
00:38:51,273 --> 00:38:53,679
you will definitely
not pursue that path.

777
00:38:56,626 --> 00:38:59,706
Technology is advancing
rapidly these days.

778
00:39:00,347 --> 00:39:01,866
Who knows, in another year

779
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:03,313
or two,

780
00:39:06,347 --> 00:39:07,633
there might be a breakthrough.

781
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:13,347
Tou Tou, you don't know this,
but sometimes I think,

782
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,779
if we could implant a chip

783
00:39:18,827 --> 00:39:20,067
into the brain,

784
00:39:22,426 --> 00:39:23,666
if it could

785
00:39:24,706 --> 00:39:26,146
control the limbs...

786
00:39:34,587 --> 00:39:36,520
It would be enough
if it could keep one alive.

787
00:39:38,825 --> 00:39:40,825
Are you a practitioner
of TCM or Western medicine?

788
00:39:40,994 --> 00:39:44,426
How come you are talking about
chips and science?

789
00:39:45,107 --> 00:39:46,226
Regardless of TCM or Western medicine,

790
00:39:46,533 --> 00:39:47,693
we should all have faith.

791
00:39:48,353 --> 00:39:49,634
Whatever power can help people,

792
00:39:50,146 --> 00:39:51,866
as long as it can help people,

793
00:39:52,347 --> 00:39:53,946
we should make use of it

794
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:55,561
to help the world,

795
00:39:56,326 --> 00:39:57,126
to love.

796
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:03,960
I understand.

797
00:40:05,252 --> 00:40:07,738
It's not just about understanding,
you should also put it into action.

798
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,240
Can you promise

799
00:40:17,019 --> 00:40:19,507
not to slip up in front of
Jian Xi and her mother?

800
00:40:24,226 --> 00:40:25,066
I... I...

801
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,520
This is challenging for me.

802
00:40:26,587 --> 00:40:28,426
You know me, how can I keep a...

803
00:40:30,666 --> 00:40:31,627
No, no.

804
00:40:31,866 --> 00:40:32,773
About this,

805
00:40:32,854 --> 00:40:35,374
I can't act...

806
00:40:37,626 --> 00:40:38,466
There is a solution.

807
00:40:38,706 --> 00:40:40,292
There is one thing
you can do to help me.

808
00:40:41,339 --> 00:40:42,819
Put one yuan into

809
00:40:43,266 --> 00:40:44,147
my piggy bank.

810
00:40:44,833 --> 00:40:46,399
If you put one yuan into it, I will...

811
00:40:52,067 --> 00:40:52,867
What does that mean?

812
00:40:53,866 --> 00:40:55,267
Why can't you put one yuan into it?

813
00:40:55,666 --> 00:40:56,507
I won't tell them.

814
00:40:56,587 --> 00:40:57,387
I will seal my lips.

815
00:40:57,699 --> 00:40:58,499
Do you trust me?

816
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,360
Trust me.

817
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,161
It's so lively.

818
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,946
What's wrong with you today?
Why do you seem so preoccupied?

819
00:41:18,067 --> 00:41:19,667
We are going shopping,
but you don't seem excited at all.

820
00:41:19,747 --> 00:41:20,547
This isn't like you.

821
00:41:22,666 --> 00:41:24,186
From today onward,

822
00:41:25,979 --> 00:41:27,539
I'm no longer a carefree person.

823
00:41:28,626 --> 00:41:29,866
I have something on my mind.

824
00:41:32,587 --> 00:41:33,786
What's with the drama?

825
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:36,226
Did you just watch some
dramatic TV show or something?

826
00:41:36,666 --> 00:41:37,866
What's bothering you? Tell me about it.

827
00:41:37,946 --> 00:41:38,786
I can't say.

828
00:41:38,866 --> 00:41:40,119
I made a promise to your dad.

829
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:41,813
You can't make me tell you.

830
00:41:42,746 --> 00:41:43,546
Okay.

831
00:41:47,866 --> 00:41:49,186
Okay?

832
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:52,339
Why don't you keep asking me about it?
How can you just give up?

833
00:41:53,107 --> 00:41:54,067
Let me put it this way.

834
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:57,706
I have no interest in participating
in the succession game.

835
00:41:57,987 --> 00:41:59,866
People die because they know too much.

836
00:42:00,027 --> 00:42:01,906
So, I don't want to know so much.

837
00:42:03,146 --> 00:42:03,946
That's why

838
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:06,107
you can't become a successor.

839
00:42:06,507 --> 00:42:07,547
It has to be me.

840
00:42:07,827 --> 00:42:09,160
I'm suited for it.

841
00:42:09,626 --> 00:42:11,146
You're too deeply involved in the game.

842
00:42:11,226 --> 00:42:12,827
By the way, I just remembered.

843
00:42:13,626 --> 00:42:15,106
You mentioned before that you wanted

844
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,099
to go bungee jumping
at Feilong Canyon, right?

845
00:42:17,626 --> 00:42:19,427
Well, I heard that place is closed now.

846
00:42:19,507 --> 00:42:20,667
You can't go there anymore.
You'll have to find another place.

847
00:42:20,747 --> 00:42:21,547
No,

848
00:42:21,787 --> 00:42:24,047
it's precisely because of this
that I have to go there.

849
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,239
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

850
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,720
(are referenced from relevant
traditional Chinese medicine books)

851
00:42:34,807 --> 00:42:35,800
