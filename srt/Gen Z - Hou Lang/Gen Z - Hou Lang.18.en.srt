00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:05,520
Mr Liu,

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,757
it is normal and very positive

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,477
for young people to pursue their dreams.

5
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,000
But if you want to hide

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,157
and obtain this certificate
just because of that,

7
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,360
I don't think it's worth it.

8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,360
Look at

9
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,000
how hard he's practising dancing now,

10
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,557
there's a good chance he will win
awards, and even become a champion.

11
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,160
Once this kind of thing is uncovered,

12
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,317
so many eyes will be on him,

13
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,200
criticizing him.

14
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,877
It will be too late to regret it then.

15
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,280
You know what will happen?
It will ruin his public image.

16
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,360
It's very serious.

17
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,320
Liu,

18
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,197
Tou Tou made a very good point.

19
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,080
Tou Tou,

20
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,200
I'm really impressed.

21
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,640
Liu, sit down.

22
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,440
Let's do what Tou Tou said, okay?

23
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,080
I know you have helped me a lot.

24
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,640
I will find another way to repay you,

25
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,997
but I can't do

26
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,440
what you asked of me today.

27
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,320
Because this concerns
your child's entire life.

28
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,160
We need to proceed with caution.

29
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,320
Don't you think so?

30
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,600
You are right, Professor.

31
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,760
I will listen to you.

32
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,720
What about me?

33
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,320
I said a lot just now.

34
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,440
I...

35
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,680
You were right too.

36
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,240
Let's be clear.

37
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,037
You chose this path,

38
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,720
so you'd better see it through the end.

39
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,520
Don't worry about it, Dad.

40
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,237
Well, I guess it's settled then.

41
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,160
I heard that Ms Dong is practising
in your clinic.

42
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,600
You know that I have issues
with my neck and lumbar spine.

43
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,717
Could you please introduce me to her?

44
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,440
It's my duty to help.

45
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,280
-Okay.
-I'll take you there right now.

46
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,000
-Thank you.
-All right.

47
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,797
He's really worrying.

48
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,080
Yes, yes,

49
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,040
but we can't just leave him be.

50
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,000
You're wearing so many clothes.

51
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,600
Aren't you feeling uncomfortably hot?

52
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,080
-So old-fashioned.
-What did you say?

53
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,640
Little brat.

54
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,680
You are so smug.

55
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,120
Help!

56
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,840
Help!

57
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,040
Help!

58
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,200
Anyone there?

59
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,360
What's wrong?

60
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,560
What's wrong?

61
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,560
My baby...

62
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,757
-Your water broke.
-My baby...

63
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,800
You're going into labour.

64
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,957
Hold on. You need to relax.
Come, come.

65
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,280
Stretch your legs out. Relax.

66
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,757
Listen to me, do as I say.

67
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,920
I'm here. You will be fine.

68
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,160
It's you!

69
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,920
Oh, my God!

70
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,557
I can't believe I would even run
into a jinx like you in the cemetery.

71
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,760
Don't touch me!

(Qibo Medical Centre)

73
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,520
When I ignored you,

74
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,520
you flourished.

75
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,600
Now that I'm taking such
meticulous care of you every day.

76
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,200
Yet how did you end up
looking like this?

77
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,760
Did you see my phone?

78
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,800
-Pardon me?
-My phone?

79
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,480
I didn't see it.

80
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,320
Master.

81
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,400
What's the matter?

82
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,600
Jian Xi is here.

83
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,720
Cursing me now won't help you, you know?

84
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,317
Your baby is
the most important thing now.

85
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,797
You hear me? It's your baby.

86
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,000
Trust me.

87
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,480
I'm a doctor.

88
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,800
Straighten your legs.

89
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,840
Oh, God.

90
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,120
I'm not going to die here, am I?

91
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,400
You won't die. You're just giving birth.

92
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,760
Our whole family

93
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,397
is going to die in your hands.

94
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,680
-Come.
-No...

95
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,877
You mustn't get agitated.

96
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,920
You have to conserve your strength,
you hear me?

97
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,437
You have to conserve your strength
to push, okay?

98
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,717
I'm calling an ambulance
for you now, okay?

99
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,320
Hang in there, you hear me?

100
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,080
No.

101
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,160
Even if you call an ambulance,

102

we're deep in the mountains,

103
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,720
by the time the ambulance arrives,
I'll be dead already.

105
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,040

Hello? Is this the first aid centre?

108
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,640
I'm at Mushan Cemetery.

109
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,200
I'm on a path.

110
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,240
A woman is going into labour here.

111
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,597
Can you guys come now?

112
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,480
Don't leave.

113
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,277
Don't go. Save my baby.

114
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,437
-I'm not leaving, I'm not leaving.
-Save my baby!

115
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,077
Hold on. I need to find a landmark.

116
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,800
Hello? There is no landmark here.

117
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,837
Can you come right now?

118
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,040
It's an emergency.

119
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,360

What's wrong?

00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,400
I'm feeling...

122
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,240
I'm feeling...

123
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,480
I'm feeling that he's coming out.

124
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,720
Hang on.

125
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,400
He's coming out.

126
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,077
Here. Sit here.

127
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:33,957
Relax.

128
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,840
Take a deep breath.

129
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,880
Take a deep breath.

130
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,040
Don't worry. I'm here.

131
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,797
Chen Hui, hang in there. Chen Hui!

132
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,920
I can't.

133
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,880
I'm here. Don't worry.

135

Jian Xi,

136
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,480
why have you lost so much weight?

137
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,840
Didn't she take the medicine
prescribed last time?

138
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,880
She did.

139
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,160
It has no effect at all.

140
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,677
Now she eats even less.

141
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,597
Lately, she won't even
take a bite of food.

142
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,080
Could her injury have caused
some other illness?

143
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,600
How about this? You guys go out first.

144
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,960
I'd like a moment alone with Jian Xi.

145

Professor Ren,

146
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,440
what's wrong with Jian Xi?

147
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,000
Is it serious?

148
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,240
I think

149
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,600
she's fine.

150
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,680
How can she be fine?

151
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,920
She won't even

152
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,120
eat now.

153
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,717
Just tell me the truth.

154
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,800
I can handle it.

155
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,400
You need to trust Professor Ren.

156
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,200
If he says it's nothing serious,

157
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,880
then there shouldn't be any problem.

158
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,080
Let's step outside for a moment, okay?

159
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,280
Plus,

160
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,600
Jian Xi will feel nervous

161

Tear it open for me.

172

-40 minutes?

the village doctor here.

Hang in there.

You won't.

184
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,840
My baby will also be dead already.

185

No.

188
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,440
I have to go see him.

189
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,160
Tear it open for me.

190
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,640
Take my baby out.

191
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,760
Save him.

192
00:08:19,739 --> 00:08:20,979
If it's a boy,

193
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,676
name him...

194
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,400
Name him Kong Nian Yuan.

195
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,880
If it's a girl, name her Kong Ai Yuan.

196
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,760
-Can you remember it?
-Okay, okay. I got it.

197
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,080
-Can you remember it?
-I got it.

198
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,720
You will be fine, Chen Hui.

199
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,280
Hang in there!

200
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,080
Chen Hui, hang in there!
Don't...

201
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,560
When will the ambulance get here?

202
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,120
You killed my husband.

203
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,280
Why...

204
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,560
Why didn't you save him?

205
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,400
(You must cherish)

206
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,917
(your time here.)

207
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,680
Don't wait until you encounter patients

208
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,560
or unexpected events

209
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,840
and find yourself helpless,

210
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,440
only then you regret for

211
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,357
not having learned

212
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,520
a useful skill here.

213
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,117
I'm the devil. Look at me, Chen Hui.

214
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,117
I'm the devil.

215
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,560
So, you have to hang in there.

216
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,437
You haven't settled
the score with me yet.

217
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,997
You have to come after me, you know?

218
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,157
You have to stay alive.

219
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,680
Do you hear me, Chen Hui?

220
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,357
-Chen Hui?
-Help me.

221
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,520
I'll help you, I will.

222
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,640
Stay with me, Chen Hui.

223
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,760
Chen Hui, hang in there! Chen Hui!

224
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,080
Your pulse is weak,

225
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,360
but it isn't a big issue.

226
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,320
Be honest with me,

227
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,760
have you

228
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,560
stopped eating?

229
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,360
There is no such thing as using tiles
as medicine, is there?

230
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,560
I'll never be able to walk again,

231
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,400
will I?

232
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,480
You've been lying to me,

233
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,520
haven't you?

234
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,320
Chen Hui.

235
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,880
Chen Hui, listen to me,

236
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,440
the ambulance is on its way,

237
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,200
but we can't wait anymore.

238
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,197
I will help you deliver, okay?

239
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,637
Just do as I say.

240
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,677
We will push together.

241
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,040
You and your baby will be fine,

242
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,240
okay? Trust me.

243
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,200
Save my baby.

244
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,080
My baby...

245
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,520
Your baby is in an incorrect position.

246
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,760
He is not head-down.

247
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,520
What should I do?

248
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,237
Save my baby first.

249
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,077
You have to save my baby first.

250
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,477
I... I'm going

251
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,917
to reach in now

252
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,440
and try to...

253
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,120
Try to turn the baby's head downward.

254
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,600
He will be fine. He will be fine, okay?

255
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,560
Trust me. He will be fine.

256
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,400
Hang in there.
I'm about to reach the baby's head.

257
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,560
I reached it.

258
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,277
Hang in there, Chen Hui.

259
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,160
Hang in there.

260
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,200
Can you feel my hand?

261
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,240
-Yes.
-Relax now.

262
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,480
Okay. It's okay now.

263
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,680
Chen Hui,

264
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,357
now listen to my instructions.

265
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,397
I will count to three,

266
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,320
and then you push.

267
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,880
Push with all your strength.

268
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,600
Come on. One, two, three.

269
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,400
Push!

270
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,440
Okay. Try again.

271
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,320
Can you push again?

272
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,120
I can't.

273
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,077
I can't push anymore.

274
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,597
-You can do it, Chen Hui.
-I can't.

275
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,720
You can do it, Chen Hui.
We are almost there.

276
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,280
You have to hang in there, Chen Hui.

277
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,560
Let's try to push again, okay?

278
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,560
Let's try it again.

279
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,437
One, two, three!

280
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,520
Push!

281
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,760
Jian Xi, I'll be honest with you.

282
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,400
I have never encountered

283
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,560
this particular medical case before.

284
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,120
However, there are records
in ancient books

285
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,117
and even in my master's

286
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,280
secret teachings.

287
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,000
If we consider TCM
as an experiential medicine,

288
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,400
it means that there were

289
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,160
successful treatments
for this case in the past.

290
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,880
Your condition is severe.

291
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,840
It will take time to recover.

292
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,357
Look, we all care about you

293
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,440
and support you.

294
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,800
Your mother hasn't given up on trying

295
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,480
every possible treatment for you.

296
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,280
If you give up on yourself,

297
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,480
then there truly is no hope left.

298
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,520
You see, throughout my journey,

299
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,917
I have been following the methods
of the ancient sages

300
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,880
to treat illnesses and save lives.

301
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,360
My faith in them

302
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
tells me that

303
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,640
the ancients were right
about many things.

304
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,200
And you...

305
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,240
How about this?

306
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,560
Give me some time.

307
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,960
Give yourself some time.

308
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,680
Let's work hard on this together.

309
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,640
What do you say?

310
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,160
What if it doesn't work?

311
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,160
What if we can't find the tiles?

312
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,640
What if we find the tiles
but it still doesn't work?

313
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,880
Will I be trapped in a wheelchair
for the rest of my life?

314
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,640
Jian Xi, you need to understand

315
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,280
that your life is not just yours alone.

316
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,440
You have your mother,

317
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,440
Professor Song,

318
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,640
and me.

319
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,400
If we try and succeed,

320
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,960
each of us will gain strength

321
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,680
in our hearts.

322
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,600
It would be a shame

323
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,360
to give up without trying,

324
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,640
wouldn't it?

325
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,760
But what if it doesn't work?

326
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,240
If it doesn't work,

327
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,480
whatever you decide to do,

328
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,920
I won't stop you.

329
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,000
Fine.

330
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,160
I'll give it one last try.

331
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,360
If it doesn't work,

332
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,280
whatever I want to do,
you can't stop me.

333
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,680
Okay.

334
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,040
It's a boy.

335
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,120
Look.

336
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,560
-Good job.
-Thank you.

337
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,837
Thank you.

338
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,720
Good job.

339
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,800
Thank you.

340
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,600
Chen Hui?

341
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,800
Chen Hui, hang in there.

342
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,000
Don't sleep, Chen Hui.

343
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:10,960
Chen Hui,

344
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,157
-hang in there.
-Anyone here?

345
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,400
Where are you?

346
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,680
Anyone here?

347
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,240
Anyone here?

348
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,800
We are here!

349
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,440
-There is someone there.
-We are here!

350
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,880
(Ling Lan)

351
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,000
Professor Ren,

352
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,920
you are right.

353
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,920
As long as we have faith,

354
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,400
we can create miracle.

355
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,560
The other day,

356
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,520
I saw a news report on TV.

357
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,797
It was about a paralysed patient
with high-level spinal cord injury

358
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,560
who managed to stand up

359
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,080
thanks to a massage technique.

360
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,560
Jian Xi,

361
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,680
you have to believe in me,

362
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,560
believe in Professor Ren.

363
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:31,960
I mean,

364
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,440
there are so many methods in this world,

365
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,600
right?

366
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,560
Even if the tiles don't work,

367
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,320
that's okay.

368
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,920
As long as there is...

369
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,200
There is even just
a glimmer of possibility,

370
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,640
I will put in my utmost effort.

371
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,040
You will stand up.

372
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,240
Mr Ren.

373
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,360
Mr Ren, hurry.

374
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,560
It's Ms Yang's call.

375
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,197
What's so urgent?

376
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,520
She has called you many times.

377
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,280
Hello?

378
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:06,960
Hello?

379
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,080
Master...

380
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,320
Master, I've learned it.

381
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,960
What?

382
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,280
I've learned the lesson of life.

383
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,520
I've learned, Master.

384
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,171
Thank you.

385
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,353
Jian Xi,

386
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,621
I hope

387
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,280
that you would have faith like we do.

388
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,120
Let's work together

389
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,600
to fight against

390
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,440
the illness.

391
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,440
We can't let it defeat us.

392
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,680
Ms Yang and Chen Hui

393
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,280
sure have an interesting relationship.

394
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,720
Speaking of which,

395
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,200
Yang Xiao Hong's operation

396
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,320
stepped on the line today.

397
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,360
You have to lecture her.

398
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,597
They called me
after they arrived at the hospital.

399
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,200
I have already reprimanded them.

400
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,357
It's not allowed

401
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,000
to perform medical procedures

402
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,560
without a professional present.

403
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,520
Even though it was an accident,
there won't be a next time.

404
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,560
It will never happen again
in this lifetime.

405
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,080
Life truly is a miracle.

406
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,240
Are you donating this set too?

407
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:58,920
Yes.

408
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,760
These...

409
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,717
We bought this with money.

410
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,920
It cost quite a bit.

411
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,920
Can't we keep them for our grandson?

412
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,520
In pursuit of knowledge,
every day something is added.

413
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,557
In the practice of the Tao,
every day something is dropped.

414
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,200
I'm dropping more and more

415
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,840
for the sake of Tao now.

416
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,077
I'm donating these books to students

417
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,477
who are pursuing knowledge.

418
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,600
Isn't it a great thing?

419
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,800
Yes.

420
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,120
Then, why is it always me

421
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,477
who suffers while you drop things?

422
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,600
You want to donate these,

423
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,637
and I'm the one who is
helping you pack them up.

424
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,160
When you were pursuing knowledge,

425
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,037
I was the one who carried your
books back and organized them for you.

426
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,320
That's why people say

427
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,000
the most profound embodiment
of Yin and Yang

428
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,440
can be witnessed
within a married couple.

429
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,080
Once I achieve enlightenment,

430
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,040
I'll take you to ascend to heaven.

431
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,160
Do you think I'm just an ordinary being?

432
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,120
You're even worse than
an ordinary being.

433
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,280
You never listen.

434
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,560
No, no.

435
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,680
You are different from
an ordinary being.

436
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,040
I listen to you.

437
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,240
Scram.

438
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,240
Give it to me.

439
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,440
-Did I injure you?
-You broke my arm.

440
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,560
Stop acting.

441
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:10,960
All right now.

442
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,717
Stop sighing.

443
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,557
This is life.

444
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,000
Seasons change,

445
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,800
it's the norm.

446
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,877
If people listen to you,
then there would be no one working.

447
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,800
Do you know

448
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,360
how many things need to be done
during the Spring Festival?

449
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,360
Spring cleaning takes two to three days,

450
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,677
preparing food and shopping
takes three to five days.

451
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,320
We need to to prepare gifts
and red envelopes

452
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,800
for relatives and children.

453
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,000
We also need to visit
teachers and friends.

454
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,480
Speaking of which,

455
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,520
what are you going to do

456
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,717
about the girls

457
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,160
for this year's Spring Festival?

458
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,437
Your son has talked about that.

459
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,117
He said Meng Meng's parents

460
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,640
are planning to take her abroad

461
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,717
to visit museums

462
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,800
and amusement parks.

463
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,440
Tou Tou

464
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,077
doesn't have parents or a home,

465
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,680
so her master

466
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,160
is her family.

467
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,880
Let's consider

468
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,800
Tou Tou as our second child.

469
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,957
The problem is I can't.

470
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,720
Tou Tou has been doing well lately.

471
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,560
She used to cause trouble for you,

472
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,800
but now she is helping you
with the chores.

473
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,440
Yes, I admit that

474
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,280
she has made
significant progress recently,

475
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,120
but she had accumulated
too many negative points before.

476
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,717
Even with great progress,

477
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,357
she hasn't fully redeemed herself yet.

478
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,640
It's only you

479
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,440
who can consider everyone as one family.

480
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,240
I don't have that kind of mindset.

481
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,317
I fight alone

482
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,520
and do the work by myself.

483
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,280
I really wish one day

484
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,880
I could let go of all responsibilities,

485
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,360
relax,

486
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,597
take leave,

487
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,477
and have some rest.

488
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,360
All right,

489
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,480
you can take time off
this Spring Festival.

490
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,960
I'll take care of everything.

491
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,040
You?

492
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,080
Did the sun rise from...

493
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,800
The west today?

494
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,600
Don't move.

495
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,000
Don't move. Just stay there.

496
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:56,960
Ling Lan?

497
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,917
How did you fall?

498
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,800
I'm fine. Mum, I'm greeting you.

499
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,197
Be careful.
The steps are covered in water.

500
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,800
Come, slowly.

501
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,080
Are you okay?

502
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,800
Move around.

503
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,720
My butt hurts.

504
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,880
I'm fine, I'm okay.

505
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,557
-Unbelievable.
-Fortunately, I cultivate everyday.

506
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,760
Turns out that
it was all for this moment.

507
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,400
Did you order Xin Zheng
to mop the floor?

508
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,840
-I didn't.
-You just brought trouble to yourself.

509
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,440
Xin Zheng, put the mop down.

510
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,880
Go and read in the study.

511
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,720
No, Mum.

512
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,200
He rarely takes the initiative
to do household chores.

513
00:25:33,433 --> 00:25:34,440
Mr Ren,

514
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,120
keep up the good work.

515
00:25:36,204 --> 00:25:37,117
If you can

516
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,197
occasionally help with household chores,

517
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,200
I don't mind falling a few more times.

518
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,317
Don't say that.

519
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,797
I'm really fine.
It's just that my butt hurts.

520
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,480
-Stop talking nonsense.
-By the way,

521
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:47,960
I mean,

522
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,397
do you see

523
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,757
the mop bucket in the yard?

524
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,920
Yes. It's right there.

525
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,557
Right. You need to put this mop

526
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,957
on that bucket.

527
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,157
And press it like this.

528
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,317
Drain the water first

529
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,880
-Yes, yes.
-before you mop the floor.

530
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,357
-Are you sure you are okay?
-Yes, yes.

531
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,680
Look. Look.

532
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,880
You are jumping? Stop it.

533
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,920
I really am fine.

534
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,280
Thank you.

535
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,597
I have been

536
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,597
to the Du Fu Thatched Cottage.

537
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,717
When Du Fu wrote

538
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,397
"The wind howled in rage
in the eighth month during autumn,

539
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,240
blowing off the thatch on my roof",

540
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,800
he was hiding in that shed
writing poetry

541
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,600
while his wife was pressing thatch

542
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,160
on the roof with a wooden stick.

543
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,357
Looks like those
astonishing achievements in history

544
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,720
are often created by those
who don't do physical labour.

545
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,520
And now, history has

546
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,760
astonishingly reappeared.

547
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,160
My first pupil,

548
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,360
you were born with such great talent,

549
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,400
and it's not meant for menial tasks
like mopping the floor.

550
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,797
-What's wrong?
-Who did this?

551
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,797
What's wrong, Mum?

552
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,677
These are two different fillings.

553
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,040
Who mixed them together?

554
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,400
-What's wrong, Mum?
-This...

555
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,760
Did you do this?

556
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,080
Yes.

557
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,837
Mum, here's what happened.
When I entered the kitchen just now,

558
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,400
there were bowls all over the place.

559
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,397
It looked messy,

560
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,000
so I decided to mix them together.

561
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,240
You know,

562
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,800
Tian Zhen doesn't eat shrimp.

563
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,280
I have to make dumplings

564
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,880
with two different fillings.

565
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:15,880
Mum,

566
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,360
it's not like he's allergic to shrimp.

567
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,760
I think this is good.

568
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,160
-You see...
-No, it isn't.

569
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,077
I spent the whole morning

570
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,720
to make them.

571
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,597
Why not let men take care
of the external affairs,

572
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,797
while the women
handle the domestic ones?

573
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,600
You had to ask him to mop the floor
and do these chores.

574
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:33,960
Xin Zheng,

575
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:34,960
go and read a book.

576
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,720
You,

577
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,480
go and mop the floor.

578
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:39,920
Yes, Mum.

579
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,917
-Don't be mad, Mum.
-Just go.

580
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,920
Go. Give me the gloves. Give them to me.

581
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,640
What should I do now?

582
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,520
(As Serene and Elegant As An Orchid)

583
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,520
I'm wiping stuff.

584
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,280
No need to raise your legs.

585
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,120
Why do you keep sighing?

586
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,720
Did you hurt your thoracic spine?

587
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,360
Want me to examine you?

588
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,437
I'm fine.

589
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,320
No need.

590
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,000
If you really don't want to do it,
I will do it.

591
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,520
You can instruct me

592
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,560
on the side.

593
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:29,880
Please don't.

594
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,200
If I let you do the chores,

595
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,560
it's going to cause
an earthquake in our house.

596
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,280
Then, let Tian Zhen and Tou Tou
do it when they come home.

597
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,920
They are studying.

598
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,720
We mustn't disturb them.

599
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,480
You see,

600
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,000
you are sighing again.

601
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,880
No wonder they say

602
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,720
the way of a noble man

603
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,280
starts with the handling of a marriage.

604
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,240
Looks like you are about to
drop some wisdom, my wife.

605
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,600
You see,

606
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,440
a person

607
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,360
either becomes a monk

608
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,320
or gets married,

609
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,717
especially women.

610
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,600
You see,

611
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,160
in marriage

612
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,477
and in being a bride,

613
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,840
the character "woman"
is always present, right?

614
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,480
Tell me more. What do you mean?

615
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,160
What I mean is,

616
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,160
look at me,

617
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,677
I can take care of external matters

618
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,997
and manage the household.

619
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,760
I'm such an outstanding person.

620
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,680
If I didn't have a marriage

621
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,640
to challenge me,

622
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,120
then my life

623
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,640
would have been uneventful.

624
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,440
No, that wouldn't be enjoyable at all.

625
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,080
That's why

626
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,120
I have you

627
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,560
and our son.

628
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,720
You make me unwilling
to let go or move on.

629
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,080
I can't get angry
or upset easily either.

630
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,480
You see, you see,

631
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,840
God really goes

632
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,680
to great lengths to help me improve.

633
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,080
You're the one
who creates problems for yourself.

634
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,080
What did our son and I do to offend you?

635
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,080
Take cleaning for example.

636
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,597
What's the difference

637
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,037
between cleaning once a year

638
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,560
and cleaning every day?

639
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,600
As there is nothing from the first,

640
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,680
where does the dust itself collect?

641
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,600
Mr Ren,

642
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,640
you have a mind free from dust,

643
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,040
so you see no dust.

644
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,800
I can't do it.

645
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,920
I don't have your
level of enlightenment.

646
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,080
You can put on socks

647
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,600
and fall asleep immediately.

648
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,597
I really want to ask you.

649
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,000
How do you do it?

650
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,237
When you meditate,

651
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,840
your mind is free from distractions.

652
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,920
When I meditate, my mind
is filled with distractions.

653
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,320
You see,

654
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,400
daily necessities,

655
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,280
prescription inspection,

656
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,560
our parents and child,

657
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,400
food and clothing.

658
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,040
Sometimes, I wonder

659
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,320
how a person's heart

660
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:06,920
can hold so many things.

661
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,560
It's remarkable.

662
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,680
A person won't have to think

663
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,480
about anything when he dies.

664
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,360
Is that how you want
to keep this conversation going?

665
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,640
So, according to what you're saying,

666
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,880
the only thing I can
look forward to is death, huh?

667
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,200
Mind your tongue.

668
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,636
Tian Zhen,

669
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,520
your dad will foot the bill
for this year's Spring Festival goods.

670
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:35,920
Okay!

671
00:31:36,004 --> 00:31:37,113
Yes!

672
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,600
Tou Tou, come.

673
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,837
See what you want to buy.

674
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,680
Since your dad is paying,

675
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,840
can we double the snacks?

676
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,360
Of course.

677
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,600
I will order them.

678
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,600
Tou Tou,

679
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,600
is this enough?

680
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,357
I think it's just about enough.

681
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,080
We can buy the rest in the supermarket.

682
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,680
Okay. I'm going to show this to my mum.

683
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,520
I'll tidy up the place first.
Then, I'll clean the study, too.

684
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,920
Then, we'll go together.

685
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:12,840
Okay.

686
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,360
I will get going first. Hurry up.

687
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,120
I don't understand.

688
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,080
You don't understand what?

689
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,640
Why are you lying to Jian Xi?

690
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,760
Why?

691
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,160
I saw it.

692
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,520
There isn't any

693
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,200
miraculous remedy
or folk remedy in this notebook.

694
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,840
It's just a notebook
for keeping accounts.

695
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,080
Why are you lying to them?

696
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,920
Their lives are miserable enough.

697
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,160
Integrity is what the way
of nature requires.

698
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,357
Acting with integrity is the way
to achieve self-refinement.

699
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,680
Weren't these your words?

700
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,477
One should not lie,

701
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,200
especially someone studying TCM.

702
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,840
Wasn't that also what you said?

703
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,440
Yet you are lying

704
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,600
to people now.

705
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,400
Why?

706
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,880
Tell me, why?

707
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,600
Why are you lying to Jian Xi?

708
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,800
You're killing me here. Tell me already!

709
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,640
Tou Tou,

710
00:34:23,999 --> 00:34:25,184
what is a doctor?

711
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,000
The most important thing for a doctor

712
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,360
is compassion.

713
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:34,876
(Compassion)

714
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,440
Heaven has the virtue of nurturing life.

715
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,320
I believe that the ancient sages

716
00:34:38,513 --> 00:34:41,073
would not punish me

717
00:34:41,427 --> 00:34:43,547
for wholeheartedly
attending to my patients.

718
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,880
If there were truly
any punishments for me,

719
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,040
as long as it means that

720
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,000
Jian Xi,

721
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:52,517
her mother,

722
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,557
and Cheng Ying

723
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:54,720
can escape this calamity,

724
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:55,800
I would accept it.

725
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,560
Actually, when I told this big lie,

726
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,440
it wasn't just for one person,

727
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,160
but for the lives of a group of people.

728
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,040
Lives, you know?

729
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,640
Doctor.

730
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,640
They call me a doctor.

731
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,280
I should bear

732
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,000
some responsibility for them,

733
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,880
especially since they even

734
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,440
paid for the consultation.

735
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,360
She didn't pay any consultation fee.

736
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,920
It's you who paid them a salary.

737
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,397
Most of them have paid
the consultation fee.

738
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,760
Jian Xi's mother

739
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,120
hasn't even started working yet.

740
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,677
No, that's not
what I want to talk about.

741
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,080
I'm asking you
why you're lying to them.

742
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:48,880
Tou Tou,

743
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,080
do you know how much Jian Xi weighs now?

744
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,360
No.

745
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,840
She's losing weights.

746
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,400
She probably weighs no more than 40kg.

747
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,440
Apart from her legs
not being able to move,

748
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,400
she is fine in other aspects.

749
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,077
If I were to tell her now

750
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,640
that her illness could not be cured,

751
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,160
I'm sure

752
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,360
she wouldn't want to live anymore.

753
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,957
And if she doesn't want to live,

754
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,477
her mother definitely

755
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,800
won't want to live either.

756
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,197
How would Cheng Ying

757
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,640
live her life then?

758
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,680
Even so,

759
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,400
we can't keep lying to her forever.

760
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,600
Sometimes, I keep pondering

761
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,600
about the purpose of

762
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,200
a doctor's existence.

763
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,117
How much help

764
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,800
can we really provide to patients?

765
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,640
Sometimes, it's just
a lack of faith in oneself.

766
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
If we have faith,

767
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,920
everything should turn out fine.

768
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,760
I constantly think to myself,

769
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,120
if I say that I am a good doctor,

770
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,840
I must strive in that direction.

771
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,680
If I say that you are a good doctor

772
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,960
and you don't believe it,

773
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,600
you will definitely
not pursue that path.

774
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:24,640
Technology is advancing
rapidly these days.

775
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,800
Who knows, in another year

776
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,240
or two,

777
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,560
there might be a breakthrough.

778
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:38,280
Tou Tou, you don't know this,
but sometimes I think,

779
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,720
if we could implant a chip

780
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,000
into the brain,

781
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,600
if it could

782
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,080
control the limbs...

783
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,480
It would be enough
if it could keep one alive.

784
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,760
Are you a practitioner
of TCM or Western medicine?

785
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,360
How come you are talking about
chips and science?

786
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,160
Regardless of TCM or Western medicine,

787
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,640
we should all have faith.

788
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,560
Whatever power can help people,

789
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,800
as long as it can help people,

790
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,880
we should make use of it

791
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,520
to help the world,

792
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,080
to love.

793
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:28,920
I understand.

794
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,680
It's not just about understanding,
you should also put it into action.

795
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,200
Can you promise

796
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,440
not to slip up in front of
Jian Xi and her mother?

797
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,000
I... I...

798
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,437
This is challenging for me.

799
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,360
You know me, how can I keep a...

800
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,560
No, no.

801
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,717
About this,

802
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,320
I can't act...

803
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,400
There is a solution.

804
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,240
There is one thing
you can do to help me.

805
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,760
Put one yuan into

806
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,080
my piggy bank.

807
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,320
If you put one yuan into it, I will...

808
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:17,800
What does that mean?

809
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,200
Why can't you put one yuan into it?

810
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,437
I won't tell them.

811
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,320
I will seal my lips.

812
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,437
Do you trust me?

813
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,320
Trust me.

814
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,120
It's so lively.

815
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,880
What's wrong with you today?
Why do you seem so preoccupied?

816
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,597
We are going shopping,
but you don't seem excited at all.

817
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,480
This isn't like you.

818
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,120
From today onward,

819
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,480
I'm no longer a carefree person.

820
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,800
I have something on my mind.

821
00:39:57,128 --> 00:39:58,796
What's with the drama?

822
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,240
Did you just watch some
dramatic TV show or something?

823
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,797
What's bothering you? Tell me about it.

824
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:03,717
I can't say.

825
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,040
I made a promise to your dad.

826
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,760
You can't make me tell you.

827
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,480
Okay.

828
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,120
Okay?

829
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:17,280
Why don't you keep asking me about it?
How can you just give up?

830
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,000
Let me put it this way.

831
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:22,640
I have no interest in participating
in the succession game.

832
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,800
People die because they know too much.

833
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,840
So, I don't want to know so much.

834
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:28,880
That's why

835
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,040
you can't become a successor.

836
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,480
It has to be me.

837
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,120
I'm suited for it.

838
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,077
You're too deeply involved in the game.

839
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,760
By the way, I just remembered.

840
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,040
You mentioned before that you wanted

841
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,040
to go bungee jumping
at Feilong Canyon, right?

842
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,357
Well, I heard that place is closed now.

843
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,597
You can't go there anymore.
You'll have to find another place.

844
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:49,000
No, it's precisely because
of this that I have to go there.

845
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,160
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

846
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,677
(are referenced from relevant
traditional Chinese medicine books)

847
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,970
