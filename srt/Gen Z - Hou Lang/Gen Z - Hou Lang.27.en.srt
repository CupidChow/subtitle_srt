1
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:05,520
Why aren't you letting us see her?

2
00:00:06,527 --> 00:00:08,327
We can't just allow our child
to do whatever she wants.

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,060
It's our fault
for spoiling her.

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,717
She's different from other children.
You guys can't treat her like this.

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,117
That's why I don't want my child

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,437
to stay sick forever.

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,877
She was fine
when she was living with us.

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,357
Why is she acting like this
after returning home then?

9
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,517
She's 18 years old.

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,197
It's inappropriate for her
to stay outside all the time.

11
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,120
Mr Xu,

12
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,200
let me give you a reminder.

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,000
You're holding her captive here.
I can call the cops on you.

14
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,000
Miss,

15
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,120
I've already discussed this
with her mother.

16
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,317
If we still can't correct her behaviour,

17
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,960
we'll treat it as if
we don't have a daughter.

18
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,557
Call the cops then.
What has this got to do with you?

19
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,757
She's your biological daughter.

20
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,240
How could you say something like that?

21
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,920
We love her very much.

22
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:44,957
To prevent anything
from happening to her,

23
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,397
I even installed iron bars in the house.

24
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,677
I already kept everything
sharp away from her.

25
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,637
What else do you want me to do?

26
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,840
What do you take her for?

27
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,320
She's a human! Not an animal!

28
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,040
Do you think I did it of my own accord?

29
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,077
She's my daughter.

30
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,760
You have no idea
about what she has done.

31
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,120
Tell me then!

32
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,400
Tell me what she has done.

33
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,997
Tell me what she has done

34
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,240
for you guys to treat her as such!

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,520
This is my family matter.

36
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,400
It has nothing to do with you two.

37
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,920
Please leave my house.

38
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,160
You're holding her captive here.

39
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,997
I won't leave this place

40
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,440
unless you allow me
to take Xu Meng away.

41
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,720
-Madam Du!
-Come back!

42
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,640
Madam Du!

43
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,640
Tian Zhen and I are here
to help Meng Meng out.

44
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,598
Where's Meng Meng?

45
00:01:25,681 --> 00:01:26,557
Is she okay?

46
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,240
We're very worried about her.
Mr Xu didn't allow us to come inside.

47
00:01:29,633 --> 00:01:30,513
Xu,

48
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,157
we'll call the cops

49
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,120
if they stay here any longer.

50
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,200
Did you hear that?

51
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,040
But Madam Du...

52
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,840
Why did you drag me away?

53
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,677
If they can call the cops on us,
we can call the cops on them too.

54
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,920
We can't.

55
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,640
If we kick a huge fuss over this,

56
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,160
by then, we won't even get to know
where they keep Meng Meng.

57
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,760
Let's ask Roubecca what to do.

58
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,597
There's only a low possibility.

59
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,560
Why?

60
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,357
They're doing this
against Xu Meng's will.

61
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,557
They're kidnapping her.

62
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,720
According to Article 239 of
the Criminal Law,

63
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,640
kidnapping may consist of
two situations or both.

64
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,997
First, kidnapping an individual

65
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,437
to extort one's wealth.

66
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,557
Second, kidnapping
an individual as a hostage

67
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,520
to achieve the kidnapper's goal.

68
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,920
Judging from what you two described,

69
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,357
the situation of Meng Meng's parents
doesn't correspond to both the former

70
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,197
or latter.

71
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,360
What about unlawful detention?

72
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,360
That's even more difficult.

73
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,717
Unlawful detention
consists of two situations.

74
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,557
First, whoever detains another

75
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,840
or deprives him of his freedom
of the person by any other means.

76
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,160
We can testify to that.

77
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,437
When we were there,

78
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,120
we heard Meng Meng yelling for help
and throwing things around.

79
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,837
Second, it needs to be illegal.

80
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,437
It's even harder to prove that.

81
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,117
They're Meng Meng's parents.

82
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,077
The radicalness of their education
and their scope of the illegality

83
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,080
were hard to categorize
in the first place.

84
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,797
Moreover, many family abuse cases,

85
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,997
including child abuse cases,

86
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,997
are difficult for the law to meddle with

87
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,960
as they are family affairs.

88
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,957
What kind of stupid law is this?

89
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,197
We can't just let them harm their family
just because they're a part of it.

90
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,320
That's wrong!

91
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,720
As the saying goes,

92
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,280
even an upright official finds it hard
to settle a family quarrel.

93
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,360
Even if you two call the cops now,

94
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,280
at most, the cops will just
act as mediators.

95
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,720
Moreover, Meng Meng has special needs.

96
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,437
How can you guys convince the cops

97
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,877
that you two treat Meng Meng better

98
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,357
than her parents?

99
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,720
But that's the truth.

100
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,837
Professor Xu

101
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,637
loves his pride more than his child.

102
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,517
He doesn't love his child
from the bottom of his heart.

103
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,717
He thinks having a daughter
like Meng Meng

104
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,600
is an embarrassment for him.

105
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,240
They don't love Meng Meng at all!

106
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,477
So, you love her from
the bottom of your heart?

107
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,397
Why don't you show the cops

108
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,680
your heart and see if it works?

109
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,917
Convincing her parents

110
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,560
is your only way out of this.

111
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,320
I think Roubecca has a point.

112
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,277
Right now, we need to convince

113
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,520
one of her parents.

114
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,637
If we manage to convince one of them,

115
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,720
Meng Meng will be able to go outside.

116
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,877
What about this?

117
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,800
Go and find your father.

118
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,280
Tell your father to find Xu Jie.

119
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,717
Xu Jie sought your father's help
before this.

120
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,480
I'm sure Xu Jie will
listen to your father.

121
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,840
I'll look for Meng Meng's mother.

122
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,160
I think her mother

123
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,557
should be different from her father.

124
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,997
I think she's more soft-hearted
than her father.

125
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,717
I'll tell her that if something
happens to Meng Meng...

126
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,680
I can't look for my father.

127
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,717
I can't communicate with my father.

128
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,440
I'm wrong no matter what I say.

129
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,080
You can look for your mother then.

130
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,637
Do you think my mother will help me out

131
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,680
if it's about Meng Meng?

132
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,640
Look for your grandfather.

133
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,157
Tell your grandfather to
give your father pressure.

134
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,120
That'll work.

135
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,440
I think

136
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,160
you should look for my father.

137
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,760
I think that's inappropriate.

138
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's about your woman.

139
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,317
Now, you're telling me
to look for your father?

140
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,077
So, you need me to work hard
for you to get a girlfriend?

141
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,477
That won't work. Listen.

142
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,317
You're a man. You have to
bear responsibility.

143
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,557
I'm helping Meng Meng
not because I like her.

144
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,720
I'm not doing it for my personal desire.

145
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,240
Why are you doing it then?

146
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,600
You have no idea.

147
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,280
Fine, I have no idea.

148
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,320
I'll look for your father.

149
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,640
Master!

150
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,640
We're in trouble!

151
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,200
Help! Hurry!

152
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,320
Let's hurry!
Let's hurry!

153
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,880
What are you doing?

154
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,240
What are you doing?

155
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,400
As the saying goes, although
treating illnesses is a priority,

156
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,400
we have to be calm and collected.

157
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,320
Look at how flustered you are.

158
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,246
You're panicking.

159
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:46,476
How could you save other people?

160
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,159
Meng Meng is in trouble!

161
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,680
Tian Zhen told you to come, right?

162
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,440
Yeah.

163
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,680
He keeps using you as his weapon.

164
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,280
-I...
-He should come and find me

165
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,320
-if he wants to take Meng Meng back.
-That's not it.

166
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,080
Tian Zhen and I went to
Meng Meng's house.

167
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,720
Meng Meng was being
held captive right now.

168
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,317
She was screaming.

169
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,240
Listen.

170
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,837
I'm sure it was her parents.

171
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,757
I'm sure it was!

172
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,480
We're in deep trouble!

173
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,917
You must be exaggerating things.

174
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,285
-Tell me the truth.
-I'm honest.

175
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,320
I don't trust you.

176
00:06:17,401 --> 00:06:19,760
Wait. If I lie to you, I won't be able
to become your successor.

177
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,440
Why don't you swear a vow then?

178
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,917
Swear that you won't take meat
for the rest of your life.

179
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,440
You mustn't joke about
such a serious matter.

180
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,637
If becoming a successor means no meat,

181
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,600
I swear that I'll become a vegetarian!

182
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,197
You can't just put these
two matters side by side.

183
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,080
Why must you compare them?

184
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,760
I thought you said

185
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,000
you didn't want to become the successor?

186
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,800
Why are you trying to be one now?

187
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,480
This is the most important thing
in my life

188
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,680
and it cannot be taken lightly.

189
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,320
Yes.

190
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:02,960
Sun Tou Tou.

191
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,680
Sun Tou Tou!

192
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,880
Lead the way!

193
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,600
Madam Du,

194
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,440
Meng Meng is your daughter.

195
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,560
Can you bear to see her
fall into despair?

196
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,837
Can you leave her to me?

197
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,720
I'll treat her well and
cure her of her condition.

198
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,757
You won't be able to.

199
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,760
I can.

200
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,720
She was fine when
she was together with me.

201
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,560
It was just a hallucination.

202
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,480
I'm her mother.

203
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:32,920
I understand her.

204
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,680
She knows how to pretend.

205
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,080
How could you say that about your child?

206
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,560
Look at this drawing.

207
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,917
Meng Meng drew it when she was two.

208
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,917
It was her first time
playing with crayons.

209
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,077
She was so happy that
she drooled all over the place.

210
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,597
I'll always remember

211
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,160
her toothless smile.

212
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,277
All the drawings you see here

213
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,560
were drawn by Meng Meng.

214
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,000
What can you feel?

215
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,240
When did she draw this?

216
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,360
She drew this right before
she got to know you guys.

217
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,037
Her drawing teacher recommended her

218
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:41,838
to participate in the ARC

219
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:43,120
International Junior
Drawing Competition.

220
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,760
This was her product.

221
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,080
The teacher felt the same way as us

222
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,040
after seeing it.

223
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,120
He had chills in his bones.

224
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,040
That's why he called us immediately.

225
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,800
What is she covering?

226
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,560
In the past,

227
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,320
I tried my best to figure it out.

228
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,160
But now,

229
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,800
I don't know if I can

230
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,720
withstand the truth.

231
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,000
Professor Ren,

232
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,680
I'm locking Meng Meng up

233
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,597
for her sake.

234
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,960
Don't you believe me?

235
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,880
Hell is others.

236
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,120
Others?

237
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,360
Who are you referring to?

238
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,957
We live in a society.

239
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,477
We can't just avoid people

240
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,880
and live by ourselves.

241
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,837
At Meng Meng's age,

242
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,240
if she goes astray,

243
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,717
her future will be ruined

244
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,200
if people spread rumours about her.

245
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,480
I don't agree.

246
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,677
If we live in other people's world

247
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,477
and form our character according
to other people's preferences,

248
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,400
there's no self to speak of.

249
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,720
Who am I then?

250
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,117
Professor Ren,

251
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,360
regarding this question of yours,

252
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,920
Sartre couldn't figure it out even after
spending his entire life studying it.

253
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,680
I just wish to know

254
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,477
what mistakes Meng Meng has committed

255
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,200
for you guys to treat her as such.

256
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,800
Was it because of a mistake
she committed previously?

257
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,597
We never expected

258
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,800
our child to be a perfect child.

259
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,000
We already came to terms with her past.

260
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,157
However, I cannot accept the present her

261
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,560
and the fact that
she doesn't have a future.

262
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,680
Do you like her?

263
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,760
If you like her,

264
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,600
if you can take care of her
for the rest of your life,

265
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,800
I'll tell you the truth.

266
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,080
I like her.

267
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,000
But I only like her as an elder brother.

268
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,477
If you're worried

269
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,840
that no one will take care of her
in the future,

270
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,800
I can give you my promise.

271
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,560
As a doctor,

272
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,080
I will take care of her
for the rest of my life.

273
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,560
That won't do.

274
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,680
This kind of promise isn't reliable.

275
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,837
But who can promise

276
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,280
that love will last forever?

277
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,640
I first met Meng Meng
in the supermarket.

278
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,880
I almost caused her death
due to my misjudgment.

279
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,000
Since then, I told myself

280
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,680
that she would be the first patient I
would take care for the rest of my life.

281
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,440
I will do my best to cure her.

282
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,440
You don't understand her.

283
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,917
She doesn't have any self-respect.

284
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,120
Don't say that.

285
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,917
All of us have the possibility

286
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,760
of being led astray.

287
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,360
We pulled through as well.

288
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,960
It's not her choice

289
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,120
to encounter a jerk.

290
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,440
That's not what I meant.

291
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,400
Do you think she'll have a future

292
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,920
if you lock her up

293
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,720
and install iron bars in the house?

294
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,360
You promised me that you would
send her back to school.

295
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,920
Professor Ren,

296
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,117
she can't go to school.

297
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,440
Why?

298
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,717
After she was born,

299
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,880
her mother and I

300
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,680
bought a life insurance policy for her
that would last until she was 18.

301
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,960
Yesterday, the insurance agent
called me.

302
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,680
He said he took out the money

303
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,440
as per Meng Meng's request.

304
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,560
I thought something was off.

305
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,397
I proceeded to investigate the case.

306
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,317
She has a bank card

307
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,800
that we use to store the money
from her red packets.

308
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,440
She took out all the money in it.

309
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,477
That's why I hurriedly brought her back

310
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,920
from your place that day.

311
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,320
Didn't you guys ask her

312
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,000
why she needed so much money?

313
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,237
We did.

314
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,200
She didn't want to tell us.

315
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,440
But I'm sure it's related
to the man she met.

316
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,680
Why do you think so?

317
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,320
We caught her.

318
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,080
When her mother switched on
the surveillance camera,

319
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,597
she smashed it with the iron spoon

320
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,280
we gave her together with her meal.

321
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,840
Her mother confiscated her phone.

322
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,640
We hired someone to unlock her phone.

323
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,917
We discovered that her chat records

324
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,200
with that man have been deleted.

325
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,797
If so, have you retrieved

326
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,120
the content of the chat records?

327
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,000
She's already 18 years old.

328
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,360
The operation counter

329
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,720
no longer allows us to retrieve
such records even as her parents.

330
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,560
Have you considered this then?

331
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,120
How would you feel

332
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,037
if there was a surveillance camera

333
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,080
monitoring you all day long?

334
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,800
There must be a sense of boundary

335
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,040
between parents and children.

336
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,920
She's not a product.

337
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,880
Professor Ren,

338
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,760
we installed a surveillance camera
in her room for a reason.

339
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,357
During her puberty,

340
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,877
I discovered

341
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,560
this vile habit of hers.

342
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,760
It was something unspeakable.

343
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,120
This is normal.

344
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,600
Everyone has desires.

345
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,600
You have to acknowledge the fact
that she was growing up.

346
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,277
That's a natural process.

347
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,840
Why is it unspeakable?

348
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,000
That will never do.

349
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,400
What if you had a son instead?

350
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,880
Can you accept him
for having such needs then?

351
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,480
Madam Du,

352
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,240
Meng Meng didn't do anything wrong.

353
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,840
Your sense of shame

354
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,440
made her think that
she had committed a mistake.

355
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,720
She didn't harm anyone.

356
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,560
But Meng Meng

357
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,160
wasn't willing to stay at home.

358
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,600
She just spent her time

359
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,960
with boys all day long.

360
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,240
This happened

361
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,040
all because we didn't notice it sooner.

362
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,037
This shouldn't be coming from a girl

363
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,480
who was born in
an educated family like ours.

364
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,037
You and your husband
can't accept the fact

365
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,560
that your child isn't like you two, huh?

366
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,840
What's with the excessive
vanity and pride?

367
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,320
In university, I excelled
at taking exams.

368
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,600
And, I depended on my thesis
to obtain professional titles.

369
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,240
Her mother is an appraiser.

370
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,120
She has obtained countless
qualifications along the way.

371
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,397
However, you don't need qualifications

372
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,040
to be a parent.

373
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,677
We've never received

374
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,957
such professional training either.

375
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:49,920
To be honest,

376
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,237
we already have no idea

377
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,797
which way is the correct way

378
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,360
of loving her.

379
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,120
Do you think we don't love our daughter?

380
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,357
Now, you might think

381
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,560
that we're harsh to her.

382
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,000
But we do love her very much.

383
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,360
I'm really confused.

384
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,397
How could a family like ours

385
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,720
nurture such a different daughter?

386
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,920
Sometimes, I felt distant

387
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,157
when I looked at her.

388
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,600
I felt like she wasn't even my daughter.

389
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,320
Actually,

390
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,800
I experienced

391
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,200
the same thing.

392
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,680
I'm a doctor.

393
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,440
And, my wife comes from a line
of TCM practitioners.

394
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,200
(Back then, I thought)

395
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,880
(my son was supposed to be born with)

396
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,960
(the essence of a medical practitioner.)

397
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,160
(He should be an excellent doctor.)

398
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,277
It's because he has all the conditions

399
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,360
to make it work.

400
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,760
However,

401
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,920
even now,

402
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,560
I don't sense

403
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,680
the potential in him
to be a great doctor.

404
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,440
But at least he can make a living.

405
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,840
Meng Meng can't survive by herself.

406
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,320
If this time,

407
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,240
we cannot correct her behaviour,

408
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,640
she'll have no future.

409
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,357
We're growing old.

410
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,080
We can't take care of her forever.

411
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,560
If something happens to me,

412
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,800
she might live on the streets.

413
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,640
She might join the crooks
on the streets.

414
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,357
I'm sure I cannot rest in peace

415
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,600
even when I'm in the afterworld.

416
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,000
We must correct her behaviour this time.

417
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,720
So, if you cannot correct her behaviour,

418
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,480
will you lock her up

419
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,440
and suffocate her with a cloth?

420
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,480
I know you graduated
from a famous university.

421
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,040
And, you have a successful career.

422
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,440
But all of that

423
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,960
have no substantial ties
to your daughter, right?

424
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,000
In a family, it doesn't matter

425
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,840
who's the smartest or
who contributes the most to the family.

426
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,800
It's about the amount of love

427
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,920
you provide.

428
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,997
Did you put down everything,

429
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,960
including your theses

430
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,200
and work

431
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,680
to keep your daughter company

432
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,600
when she needed your love the most?

433
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,600
Professor Ren,

434
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,480
I wish to ask you something.

435
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,997
How much time do you

436
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,080
actually spend with Tian Zhen?

437
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,000
I don't mean anything else.

438
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,840
I just wish to understand

439
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,080
the gap between me

440
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,480
and other people's fathers.

441
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,840
Doctors don't treat themselves.

442
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,360
I'm a selfish mother.

443
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,080
I truly wish

444
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,477
that a positive boy

445
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,317
with a good personality
and background like you

446
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,717
will fall for her

447
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,757
and save her from the abyss.

448
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,800
Madam Du,

449
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,160
you cannot expect
another person to save her.

450
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,280
It's wrong of you to think so.

451
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,960
Now, I know.

452
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,120
Your constant denial of her worth
is the cause of her issue.

453
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,797
It's because she can never satisfy

454
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,080
your expectations.

455
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,157
She's disappointed in herself.

456
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,080
That's why she forsakes herself

457
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,920
with such a demeaning method.

458
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,800
Dr Ren,

459
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,160
my husband and I

460
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,320
have made a lot of money
all these years.

461
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,000
As long as you're nice to her,

462
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,560
everything will be yours.

463
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,277
I'm Meng Meng's mother.

464
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,397
I understand her.

465
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,480
She trusts you.

466
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,600
Now, you're the only one
who can save her.

467
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,597
If you become her boyfriend...

468
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,560
Madam Du,

469
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,920
love cannot be bought with money.

470
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,800
I already have someone I fancy.

471
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,680
I knew it.

472
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,360
An excellent boy like you

473
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,757
has plenty of suitors.

474
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,680
That's not true.

475
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,200
I like her.

476
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,000
But she might not like me.

477
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,560
Hello?

478
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,400
Hello?

479
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,640
What?

480
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,800
What?

481
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,040
What did you say?

482
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,960
(Jiangzhou People's Hospital)

483
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,920
Meng Meng!

484
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,480
Meng Meng!

485
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,840
Meng Meng!

486
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,600
Meng Meng!

487
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,080
Why did you abandon me?

488
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,800
Why did you abandon me?

489
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,237
-Meng Meng!
-She was fine at home!

490
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,880
Why did you let her out?

491
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,637
Although she's your child,

492
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,400
I was the one raising her!

493
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,280
She looked so pitiful in her room!

494
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,440
You see,

495
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:25,320
even dogs get to take walks every day.

496
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,360
She's my daughter!

497
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,397
I know her the best!

498
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,917
Look at what you've done!

499
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,480
I know. I know I shouldn't
take her outside.

500
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,037
I just allowed her access

501
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,840
to the balcony on the second floor.

502
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,117
She was still fine a few days ago.

503
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,757
But for some reason,

504
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,160
she scaled the outer wall today.

505
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,280
Meng Meng.

506
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,840
Meng Meng?

507
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,280
Do you still remember me?

508
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:49,542
We met each other in the supermarket.

509
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,649
My name is Ren Tian Zhen.

510
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,160
Hello.

511
00:25:15,379 --> 00:25:16,459
Come here.

512
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,200
Great-uncle,

513
00:25:18,284 --> 00:25:19,321
this is my patient.

514
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,837
I can't let her stay here alone.

515
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,960
I need to keep her company.

516
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,000
You guys can enjoy your meal.

517
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,280
It's fine.

518
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,800
It's fine. It's me.

519
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:29,920
It's fine.

520
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,760
Meng Meng!

521
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:39,877
Meng Meng, it's just an alarm.

522
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,960
I've already switched it off. Meng Meng.

523
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,680
Everything's fine now. Don't be scared.

524
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,760
It's useless to toss it like that.

525
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,920
You got it!

526
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,840
(Qibo Medical Centre)

527
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,800
Ms Xia.

528
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:31,997
Oh yeah.

529
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:32,960
Ms Xia, I need to ask you something.

530
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,960
You didn't arrange any shifts
for me tomorrow, right?

531
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,240
Don't worry. I didn't
arrange any for you.

532
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,000
Zhao, you're going to meet
your first client tomorrow.

533
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,760
I pray that you can close the deal.

534
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:43,920
You can do it!

535
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,637
Thank you, Ms Xia.
I hope it will come true.

536
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,917
-You can do it!
-Goodbye.

537
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,880
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

538
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,517
You're back?

539
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,480
You're back already?

540
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,320
Isn't the medical centre busy today?

541
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,000
Everyone is disheartened over
Meng Meng's passing.

542
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,240
Ms Xia didn't assign
any extra patients to all doctors today.

543
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:19,680
That's why I came back early.

544
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,960
What happened to Meng Meng
was quite a shame.

545
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:26,960
Yeah.

546
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,720
If I were in her shoes,

547
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,717
when I thought about my mother, father,

548
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,680
and my brother,

549
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,960
I didn't dare to take my life.

550
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:36,880
Let me do it.

551
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,240
-Be careful.
-I'll be fine.

552
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,960
Tian Zhen has it the roughest among us.

553
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,240
He didn't even come
to the medical centre today.

554
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,800
I wonder how he's doing.

555
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,920
Be careful.

556
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,200
Hello, Granny?

557
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,680
Tian Zhen.

558
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,840
Where are you?

559
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,440
I went out to take a breather.

560
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,280
You went out to take a breather?

561
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,280
When will you come back?

562
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:32,920
Maybe after a few days.

563
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:33,920
Don't worry.

564
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,720
I just want

565
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,240
to be alone for some time.

566
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,720
Be alone?

567
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,120
Tian Zhen, you're so young.

568
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,277
It's not time for you to be alone yet.

569
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,357
Hurry and come back.

570
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,320
Mum.

571
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,720
(Wait a moment.)

572
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,640
Hello, son?

573
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,720
What's the matter?

574
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,320
He hung up.

575
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:01,997
He needs some time alone.

576
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:02,957
Look at your son.

577
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:03,920
Just give him some time.

578
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,240
As a doctor,

579
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,520
there are many times
when we will fail as well.

580
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,360
If everyone acts like him,

581
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,680
I think everyone
can pack their bags and resign.

582
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,757
Do you think doctors

583
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,560
are the only ones
who'll experience such emotions?

584
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,840
No matter what emotion it is,
it shouldn't affect their job.

585
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,637
As a man, and as a doctor,

586
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,997
no matter what you encounter in life,

587
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,600
you still have to return to work.

588
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,637
He has to know

589
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,200
that there are many patients out here
waiting to receive his treatment.

590
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,360
What kind of child is this?

591
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,240
Tell someone to find him.

592
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,840
Who?

593
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,880
Where can we find him?

594
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,397
Phones nowadays cannot be used

595
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,277
to determine one's location.

596
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,720
If only we can know his whereabouts

597
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,640
after calling him.

598
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:54,920
This...

599
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,600
I know where he goes.

600
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,440
Ren Tian Zhen!

601
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,360
Ren Tian Zhen!

602
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,561
Ren Tian Zhen!

603
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,720
Ren Tian Zhen!

604
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,480
Ren Tian Zhen!

605
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,560
Wake up!

606
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,760
Wake up!

607
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,080
Wake up!

608
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,080
Ren Tian Zhen!

609
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,160
Ren Tian Zhen!

610
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,600
Ren Tian Zhen! Wake up!

611
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,680
Wake up!

612
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,520
Ren Tian Zhen!

613
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,460
You terrified me!

614
00:34:31,446 --> 00:34:32,566
Have you lost your mind?

615
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:33,877
Have you lost your mind?

616
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,080
Listen!

617
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,197
You've crossed the line!

618
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,237
Do you think you can take your life
without thinking?

619
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,997
What about your grandparents?

620
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,880
What about your parents?

621
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,280
How could you jump into the lake?

622
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,237
I wasn't fast enough

623
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,037
to save you, you know?

624
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:47,877
Ren Tian Zhen!

625
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,277
Have you lost your mind?

626
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,197
Get up!

627
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,160
Get up!

628
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,240
Get up!

629
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,160
I just want to know

630
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,240
how terrible it felt like

631
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,200
when Meng Meng jumped off the building.

632
00:35:09,413 --> 00:35:10,333
I understand now.

633
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,520
I'm not meant to be a doctor.

634
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,320
My father was right.

635
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,640
I was born

636
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,040
a failure.

637
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,040
The patient I was determined to save
died on me.

638
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,280
And, I attempted this bungee
after much thought.

639
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,600
I would've died if it weren't for you.

640
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,760
No matter what I do,

641
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,560
I will end up failing.

642
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,840
My father said this once
during his lesson.

643
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,480
When a person keeps succeeding,

644
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,280
they'll magnify their strengths.

645
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,600
They'll think that
everything they do is right.

646
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:58,040
However, their capability only
played a small part in their success.

647
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,040
They succeeded only because of luck.

648
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,320
Your father said

649
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,080
we must be watchful of our pride
and fear all the time.

650
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
My father was talking about
the almighty truth.

651
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,800
Some people are born lucky.

652
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,280
For example, you.

653
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,517
You always save the people

654
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,920
around you.

655
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,560
That's why you should become a doctor.

656
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,560
Maybe I'm just unlucky.

657
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,800
You're more like their child
compared to me.

658
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,080
You're wrong.

659
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,160
I wasn't not lucky.

660
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,800
It wasn't luck.

661
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,520
I just didn't give up.

662
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,960
When I was standing on the mountaintop,

663
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,400
I didn't see that your feet
were tied to a rope

664
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,240
(when you jumped down.)

665
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,000
If that's the case,

666
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,440
even if I did rush here,

667
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,840
you would've been dead anyhow.

668
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,400
The correct thing for me to do

669
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,800
was to call the cops.

670
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,680
But I didn't.

671
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,720
I just kept running.

672
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,200
(I kept running.)

673
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,800
(My mind was totally blank.)

674
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,320
(I just kept running.)

675
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,800
(I would've broken the world record
for sprinting)

676
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,000
if there was a timer.

677
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,160
Your father said this as well.

678
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,037
Every mother has the strength

679
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,197
to lift a car and save their child

680
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,040
when they need it.

681
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,400
You thought I was lucky?

682
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,680
That's not the case.

683
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,520
I just didn't give up on you.

684
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,520
I didn't

685
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,840
give up on you.

686
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,360
Stop denying your worth.

687
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,960
No one can define who you are
but yourself.

688
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,800
The fortune teller said this

689
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,160
when we met him.

690
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,760
He said you were a late bloomer.

691
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,720
That means you still have

692
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,960
a lot to achieve after this.

693
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,400
So, you shouldn't rush things.

694
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,600
I'm not as confident as you.

695
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,600
But I'm confident in you.

696
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,680
What's wrong?

697
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,440
My tummy hurts.

698
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,400
Where?

699
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,040
Here.

700
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,520
When did it start to hurt?

701
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,480
Tou Tou?

702
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,480
Tou Tou!

703
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,877
Where's your phone?

704
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,760
Tou Tou, wake up!

705
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,560
Tou Tou, you mustn't fall asleep!

706
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,080
Tou Tou, wake up!

707
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,437
Is anyone around?

708
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,600
Tou Tou!

709
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,560
Is anyone around?

710
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,000
Help!

711
00:39:23,446 --> 00:39:24,406
Tou Tou!

712
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,840
Tou Tou, wake up!

713
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,440
Tou Tou!

714
00:39:29,526 --> 00:39:31,120
Tou Tou, wake up!

715
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,520
Tou Tou!

716
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,320
She has a high fever.

717
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,560
Apply it to her forehead.

718
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,636
Rhubarb, peach pit, and winter melon?

719
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,760
Kid,
that's too strong for her.

720
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,437
How could you use so much rhubarb?

721
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,677
You'll harm her!

722
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,160
Are you sure you know what you're doing?

723
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,760
No. We have to send her
to the hospital now.

724
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,437
It's late now.

725
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,357
No one in the village
is willing to drive.

726
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,360
Yeah.

727
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,197
Tell Gui

728
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,320
to drive the vehicle here.

729
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,397
How long does it take
to reach the hospital?

730
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,520
Just borrow the car for me.
I can drive there myself.

731
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,677
No, you won't be able to do it.

732
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,200
-I...
-It's very far away.

733
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,440
It's dark outside, and you'll be
driving across mountain terrains.

734
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,720
This is too dangerous.

735
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,120
It's an acute abdomen.
I don't know if I can treat you.

736
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,120
It'll be troublesome if the wound
festers when I perform perforation.

737
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,520
Let me send you to the hospital.

738
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,080
We only have three hours.

739
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,760
Driving at night or performing
perforation has equal risk.

Tian Zhen.

741
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,560

00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,026
I'll take it.
