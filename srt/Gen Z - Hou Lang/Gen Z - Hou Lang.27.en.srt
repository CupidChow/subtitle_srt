1
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:34,819
(Gen Z)

2
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,800
(Episode 27)

3
00:01:39,424 --> 00:01:40,583
Why aren't you letting us see her?

4
00:01:41,663 --> 00:01:43,463
We can't just allow our child
to do whatever she wants.

5
00:01:45,023 --> 00:01:45,984
It's our fault

6
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,544
for spoiling her.

7
00:01:47,784 --> 00:01:48,704
She's different from other children.

8
00:01:48,704 --> 00:01:49,904
You guys can't treat her like this.

9
00:01:49,904 --> 00:01:51,264
That's why I don't want my child

10
00:01:51,264 --> 00:01:52,584
to stay sick forever.

11
00:01:52,584 --> 00:01:54,024
She was fine
when she was living with us.

12
00:01:54,024 --> 00:01:55,504
Why is she acting like this
after returning home then?

13
00:01:55,504 --> 00:01:56,664
She's 18 years old.

14
00:01:56,664 --> 00:01:58,344
It's inappropriate for her
to stay outside all the time.

15
00:01:58,344 --> 00:01:59,184
Mr Xu,

16
00:02:00,184 --> 00:02:01,264
let me give you a reminder.

17
00:02:02,024 --> 00:02:04,063
You're holding her captive here.
I can call the cops on you.

18
00:02:06,264 --> 00:02:07,064
Miss,

19
00:02:07,224 --> 00:02:09,184
I've already discussed this
with her mother.

20
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:11,423
If we still can't correct her behaviour,

21
00:02:11,463 --> 00:02:13,024
we'll treat it as if
we don't have a daughter.

22
00:02:13,184 --> 00:02:14,704
Call the cops then.
What has this got to do with you?

23
00:02:14,704 --> 00:02:15,903
She's your biological daughter.

24
00:02:15,903 --> 00:02:17,303
How could you say something like that?

25
00:02:17,544 --> 00:02:18,984
We love her very much.

26
00:02:19,103 --> 00:02:20,024
To prevent anything
from happening to her,

27
00:02:20,103 --> 00:02:21,504
I even installed iron bars in the house.

28
00:02:21,544 --> 00:02:22,800
I already kept everything
sharp away from her.

29
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:23,720
What else do you want me to do?

30
00:02:23,783 --> 00:02:24,903
What do you take her for?

31
00:02:25,064 --> 00:02:26,384
She's a human! Not an animal!

32
00:02:26,544 --> 00:02:28,103
Do you think I did it of my own accord?

33
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:29,224
She's my daughter.

34
00:02:29,224 --> 00:02:30,824
You have no idea
about what she has done.

35
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:32,184
Tell me then!

36
00:02:32,463 --> 00:02:33,463
Tell me what she has done.

37
00:02:33,704 --> 00:02:35,143
Tell me what she has done

38
00:02:35,143 --> 00:02:36,303
for you guys to treat her as such!

39
00:02:43,064 --> 00:02:44,583
This is my family matter.

40
00:02:44,903 --> 00:02:46,464
It has nothing to do with you two.

41
00:02:47,784 --> 00:02:48,984
Please leave my house.

42
00:02:50,263 --> 00:02:51,223
You're holding her captive here.

43
00:02:51,863 --> 00:02:53,144
I won't leave this place

44
00:02:53,144 --> 00:02:54,503
unless you allow me
to take Xu Meng away.

45
00:02:55,263 --> 00:02:56,784
-Madam Du!
-Come back!

46
00:02:56,903 --> 00:02:57,716
Madam Du!

47
00:02:58,424 --> 00:02:59,704
Tian Zhen and I are here
to help Meng Meng out.

48
00:02:59,943 --> 00:03:00,744
Where's Meng Meng?

49
00:03:00,744 --> 00:03:01,623
Is she okay?

50
00:03:01,704 --> 00:03:02,503
We're very worried about her.

51
00:03:02,503 --> 00:03:04,303
Mr Xu didn't allow us to come inside.

52
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,738
Xu,

53
00:03:05,984 --> 00:03:07,263
we'll call the cops

54
00:03:07,303 --> 00:03:08,183
if they stay here any longer.

55
00:03:08,384 --> 00:03:09,263
Did you hear that?

56
00:03:11,064 --> 00:03:12,104
But Madam Du...

57
00:03:17,503 --> 00:03:18,903
Why did you drag me away?

58
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,762
If they can call the cops on us,
we can call the cops on them too.

59
00:03:20,823 --> 00:03:21,984
We can't.

60
00:03:22,784 --> 00:03:23,704
If we kick a huge fuss over this,

61
00:03:24,144 --> 00:03:26,223
by then, we won't even get to know
where they keep Meng Meng.

62
00:03:31,623 --> 00:03:32,823
Let's ask Roubecca what to do.

63
00:03:39,863 --> 00:03:40,704
There's only a low possibility.

64
00:03:40,744 --> 00:03:41,603
Why?

65
00:03:41,744 --> 00:03:43,504
They're doing this
against Xu Meng's will.

66
00:03:43,504 --> 00:03:44,623
They're kidnapping her.

67
00:03:44,704 --> 00:03:46,784
According to Article 239 of
the Criminal Law,

68
00:03:47,224 --> 00:03:49,704
kidnapping may consist of
two situations or both.

69
00:03:50,064 --> 00:03:52,144
First, kidnapping an individual

70
00:03:52,144 --> 00:03:53,543
to extort one's wealth.

71
00:03:53,584 --> 00:03:55,663
Second, kidnapping
an individual as a hostage

72
00:03:55,704 --> 00:03:58,584
to achieve the kidnapper's goal.

73
00:03:58,903 --> 00:04:00,984
Judging from what you two described,

74
00:04:01,144 --> 00:04:03,424
the situation of Meng Meng's parents
doesn't correspond to both the former

75
00:04:03,504 --> 00:04:04,304
or latter.

76
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:05,424
What about unlawful detention?

77
00:04:05,543 --> 00:04:06,424
That's even more difficult.

78
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,864
Unlawful detention
consists of two situations.

79
00:04:08,864 --> 00:04:10,704
First, whoever detains another

80
00:04:10,704 --> 00:04:11,903
or deprives him of his freedom
of the person by any other means.

81
00:04:12,504 --> 00:04:14,228
We can testify to that.

82
00:04:14,383 --> 00:04:15,584
When we were there,

83
00:04:15,584 --> 00:04:17,183
we heard Meng Meng yelling for help
and throwing things around.

84
00:04:17,984 --> 00:04:21,984
Second, it needs to be illegal.

85
00:04:21,984 --> 00:04:23,584
It's even harder to prove that.

86
00:04:23,584 --> 00:04:25,263
They're Meng Meng's parents.

87
00:04:25,263 --> 00:04:28,224
The radicalness of their education
and their scope of the illegality

88
00:04:28,224 --> 00:04:30,144
were hard to categorize
in the first place.

89
00:04:30,424 --> 00:04:32,944
Moreover, many family abuse cases,

90
00:04:32,944 --> 00:04:34,144
including child abuse cases,

91
00:04:34,144 --> 00:04:36,144
are difficult for the law to meddle with

92
00:04:36,144 --> 00:04:37,023
as they are family affairs.

93
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:40,103
What kind of stupid law is this?

94
00:04:40,103 --> 00:04:42,344
We can't just let them harm their family
just because they're a part of it.

95
00:04:42,344 --> 00:04:43,383
That's wrong!

96
00:04:45,504 --> 00:04:46,784
As the saying goes,

97
00:04:47,064 --> 00:04:49,344
even an upright official finds it hard
to settle a family quarrel.

98
00:04:49,704 --> 00:04:51,424
Even if you two call the cops now,

99
00:04:51,584 --> 00:04:53,344
at most, the cops will just
act as mediators.

100
00:04:53,784 --> 00:04:55,784
Moreover, Meng Meng has special needs.

101
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:58,584
How can you guys convince the cops

102
00:04:58,584 --> 00:05:00,023
that you two treat Meng Meng better

103
00:05:00,023 --> 00:05:01,504
than her parents?

104
00:05:01,504 --> 00:05:02,784
But that's the truth.

105
00:05:02,944 --> 00:05:03,984
Professor Xu

106
00:05:03,984 --> 00:05:05,784
loves his pride more than his child.

107
00:05:05,784 --> 00:05:07,663
He doesn't love his child
from the bottom of his heart.

108
00:05:07,663 --> 00:05:08,864
He thinks having a daughter
like Meng Meng

109
00:05:08,864 --> 00:05:10,663
is an embarrassment for him.

110
00:05:10,823 --> 00:05:12,304
They don't love Meng Meng at all!

111
00:05:12,424 --> 00:05:13,584
So, you love her from
the bottom of your heart?

112
00:05:13,623 --> 00:05:14,463
Why don't you show the cops

113
00:05:14,543 --> 00:05:15,743
your heart and see if it works?

114
00:05:18,864 --> 00:05:21,023
Convincing her parents

115
00:05:21,064 --> 00:05:23,623
is your only way out of this.

116
00:05:32,424 --> 00:05:34,383
I think Roubecca has a point.

117
00:05:34,623 --> 00:05:36,383
Right now, we need to convince

118
00:05:36,424 --> 00:05:37,584
one of her parents.

119
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:39,784
If we manage to convince one of them,

120
00:05:39,784 --> 00:05:40,784
Meng Meng will be able to go outside.

121
00:05:42,064 --> 00:05:42,944
What about this?

122
00:05:43,023 --> 00:05:43,874
Go and find your father.

123
00:05:44,064 --> 00:05:45,344
Tell your father to find Xu Jie.

124
00:05:45,504 --> 00:05:47,864
Xu Jie sought your father's help
before this.

125
00:05:47,864 --> 00:05:49,543
I'm sure Xu Jie will
listen to your father.

126
00:05:50,144 --> 00:05:51,904
I'll look for Meng Meng's mother.

127
00:05:52,223 --> 00:05:53,223
I think her mother

128
00:05:53,424 --> 00:05:54,704
should be different from her father.

129
00:05:54,704 --> 00:05:56,144
I think she's more soft-hearted
than her father.

130
00:05:56,144 --> 00:05:57,864
I'll tell her that if something
happens to Meng Meng...

131
00:05:57,864 --> 00:05:58,744
I can't look for my father.

132
00:05:59,223 --> 00:06:00,823
I can't communicate with my father.

133
00:06:00,864 --> 00:06:02,503
I'm wrong no matter what I say.

134
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,144
You can look for your mother then.

135
00:06:04,343 --> 00:06:06,783
Do you think my mother will help me out

136
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:07,744
if it's about Meng Meng?

137
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:10,704
Look for your grandfather.

138
00:06:10,984 --> 00:06:13,304
Tell your grandfather to
give your father pressure.

139
00:06:13,304 --> 00:06:14,184
That'll work.

140
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,482
I think

141
00:06:16,144 --> 00:06:18,223
you should look for my father.

142
00:06:21,503 --> 00:06:22,823
I think that's inappropriate.

143
00:06:23,063 --> 00:06:24,063
It's about your woman.

144
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:25,464
Now, you're telling me
to look for your father?

145
00:06:25,464 --> 00:06:28,223
So, you need me to work hard
for you to get a girlfriend?

146
00:06:28,223 --> 00:06:29,624
That won't work. Listen.

147
00:06:29,624 --> 00:06:31,464
You're a man. You have to
bear responsibility.

148
00:06:31,464 --> 00:06:33,663
I'm helping Meng Meng
not because I like her.

149
00:06:33,704 --> 00:06:34,783
I'm not doing it for my personal desire.

150
00:06:36,343 --> 00:06:37,304
Why are you doing it then?

151
00:06:39,624 --> 00:06:40,679
You have no idea.

152
00:06:43,304 --> 00:06:44,343
Fine, I have no idea.

153
00:06:44,464 --> 00:06:45,390
I'll look for your father.

154
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:57,713
Master!

155
00:06:57,883 --> 00:06:58,698
We're in trouble!

156
00:06:58,864 --> 00:07:00,263
Help! Hurry!

157
00:07:00,424 --> 00:07:01,279
Let's hurry!

158
00:07:01,304 --> 00:07:03,383
Let's hurry!

159
00:07:06,464 --> 00:07:07,943
What are you doing?

160
00:07:09,184 --> 00:07:10,304
What are you doing?

161
00:07:11,704 --> 00:07:14,464
As the saying goes, although
treating illnesses is a priority,

162
00:07:15,704 --> 00:07:17,464
we have to be calm and collected.

163
00:07:18,144 --> 00:07:19,383
Look at how flustered you are.

164
00:07:19,503 --> 00:07:20,584
You're panicking.

165
00:07:20,728 --> 00:07:21,543
How could you save other people?

166
00:07:21,543 --> 00:07:24,144
Meng Meng is in trouble!

167
00:07:25,424 --> 00:07:26,744
Tian Zhen told you to come, right?

168
00:07:27,704 --> 00:07:28,503
Yeah.

169
00:07:28,783 --> 00:07:30,744
He keeps using you as his weapon.

170
00:07:31,464 --> 00:07:33,343
-I...
-He should come and find me

171
00:07:33,503 --> 00:07:35,383
-if he wants to take Meng Meng back.
-That's not it.

172
00:07:35,624 --> 00:07:37,144
Tian Zhen and I went to
Meng Meng's house.

173
00:07:37,744 --> 00:07:39,783
Meng Meng was being
held captive right now.

174
00:07:39,904 --> 00:07:41,424
She was screaming.

175
00:07:41,464 --> 00:07:42,304
Listen.

176
00:07:42,584 --> 00:07:43,984
I'm sure it was her parents.

177
00:07:43,984 --> 00:07:44,904
I'm sure it was!

178
00:07:44,904 --> 00:07:46,543
We're in deep trouble!

179
00:07:47,904 --> 00:07:50,063
You must be exaggerating things.

180
00:07:50,063 --> 00:07:51,663
-Tell me the truth.
-I'm honest.

181
00:07:51,663 --> 00:07:52,464
I don't trust you.

182
00:07:52,464 --> 00:07:54,823
Wait. If I lie to you, I won't be able
to become your successor.

183
00:07:56,223 --> 00:07:57,503
Why don't you swear a vow then?

184
00:07:58,503 --> 00:08:00,063
Swear that you won't take meat
for the rest of your life.

185
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:01,503
You mustn't joke about
such a serious matter.

186
00:08:02,424 --> 00:08:03,783
If becoming a successor means no meat,

187
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:05,663
I swear that I'll become a vegetarian!

188
00:08:06,584 --> 00:08:08,343
You can't just put these
two matters side by side.

189
00:08:08,343 --> 00:08:09,144
Why must you compare them?

190
00:08:17,624 --> 00:08:18,823
I thought you said

191
00:08:19,744 --> 00:08:21,063
you didn't want to become the successor?

192
00:08:21,744 --> 00:08:22,864
Why are you trying to be one now?

193
00:08:25,464 --> 00:08:27,543
This is the most important thing
in my life

194
00:08:28,704 --> 00:08:29,744
and it cannot be taken lightly.

195
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,374
Yes.

196
00:08:37,223 --> 00:08:38,024
Sun Tou Tou.

197
00:08:38,904 --> 00:08:39,733
Sun Tou Tou!

198
00:08:41,063 --> 00:08:41,921
Lead the way!

199
00:08:46,744 --> 00:08:47,663
Madam Du,

200
00:08:48,144 --> 00:08:49,503
Meng Meng is your daughter.

201
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,624
Can you bear to see her
fall into despair?

202
00:08:52,464 --> 00:08:53,984
Can you leave her to me?

203
00:08:53,984 --> 00:08:55,783
I'll treat her well and
cure her of her condition.

204
00:08:56,864 --> 00:08:57,904
You won't be able to.

205
00:08:57,904 --> 00:08:58,819
I can.

206
00:08:59,184 --> 00:09:01,783
She was fine when 
she was together with me.

207
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:04,624
It was just a hallucination.

208
00:09:05,464 --> 00:09:06,543
I'm her mother.

209
00:09:07,144 --> 00:09:07,984
I understand her.

210
00:09:08,704 --> 00:09:09,744
She knows how to pretend.

211
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:13,144
How could you say that about your child?

212
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:16,624
Look at this drawing.

213
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:22,063
Meng Meng drew it when she was two.

214
00:09:22,063 --> 00:09:24,063
It was her first time
playing with crayons.

215
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:27,223
She was so happy that
she drooled all over the place.

216
00:09:27,223 --> 00:09:28,744
I'll always remember

217
00:09:28,744 --> 00:09:32,223
her toothless smile.

218
00:09:37,864 --> 00:09:39,424
All the drawings you see here

219
00:09:39,424 --> 00:09:40,624
were drawn by Meng Meng.

220
00:09:52,744 --> 00:09:54,063
What can you feel?

221
00:10:08,744 --> 00:10:10,304
When did she draw this?

222
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:13,424
She drew this right before
she got to know you guys.

223
00:10:14,064 --> 00:10:16,184
Her drawing teacher recommended her

224
00:10:16,184 --> 00:10:16,984
to participate in the ARC

225
00:10:16,984 --> 00:10:18,184
International Junior
Drawing Competition.

226
00:10:18,864 --> 00:10:20,824
This was her product.

227
00:10:21,624 --> 00:10:23,143
The teacher felt the same way as us

228
00:10:23,424 --> 00:10:25,103
after seeing it.

229
00:10:25,864 --> 00:10:27,184
He had chills in his bones.

230
00:10:27,384 --> 00:10:30,103
That's why he called us immediately.

231
00:10:31,744 --> 00:10:32,864
What is she covering?

232
00:10:33,663 --> 00:10:34,608
In the past,

233
00:10:35,064 --> 00:10:36,384
I tried my best to figure it out.

234
00:10:37,184 --> 00:10:38,223
But now,

235
00:10:38,624 --> 00:10:40,864
I don't know if I can

236
00:10:41,624 --> 00:10:42,783
withstand the truth.

237
00:10:51,264 --> 00:10:52,064
Professor Ren,

238
00:10:53,384 --> 00:10:54,744
I'm locking Meng Meng up

239
00:10:55,663 --> 00:10:56,744
for her sake.

240
00:10:56,744 --> 00:10:58,023
Don't you believe me?

241
00:11:01,624 --> 00:11:02,944
Hell is others.

242
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:06,186
Others?

243
00:11:07,424 --> 00:11:08,424
Who are you referring to?

244
00:11:10,864 --> 00:11:12,103
We live in a society.

245
00:11:12,103 --> 00:11:13,624
We can't just avoid people

246
00:11:13,624 --> 00:11:14,944
and live by ourselves.

247
00:11:15,504 --> 00:11:16,984
At Meng Meng's age,

248
00:11:16,984 --> 00:11:18,304
if she goes astray,

249
00:11:19,184 --> 00:11:20,824
her future will be ruined

250
00:11:20,864 --> 00:11:22,264
if people spread rumours about her.

251
00:11:23,624 --> 00:11:24,543
I don't agree.

252
00:11:26,984 --> 00:11:28,824
If we live in other people's world

253
00:11:28,824 --> 00:11:31,624
and form our character according
to other people's preferences,

254
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:33,463
there's no self to speak of.

255
00:11:35,504 --> 00:11:36,783
Who am I then?

256
00:11:39,384 --> 00:11:40,264
Professor Ren,

257
00:11:40,264 --> 00:11:41,424
regarding this question of yours,

258
00:11:42,624 --> 00:11:44,984
Sartre couldn't figure it out even after
spending his entire life studying it.

259
00:11:46,984 --> 00:11:48,744
I just wish to know

260
00:11:49,504 --> 00:11:51,583
what mistakes Meng Meng has committed

261
00:11:51,624 --> 00:11:53,264
for you guys to treat her as such.

262
00:11:53,744 --> 00:11:55,864
Was it because of a mistake
she committed previously?

263
00:11:59,504 --> 00:12:00,744
We never expected

264
00:12:00,744 --> 00:12:02,864
our child to be a perfect child.

265
00:12:03,343 --> 00:12:05,064
We already came to terms with her past.

266
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:08,264
However, I cannot accept the present her

267
00:12:08,304 --> 00:12:09,624
and the fact that
she doesn't have a future.

268
00:12:22,624 --> 00:12:23,744
Do you like her?

269
00:12:24,424 --> 00:12:25,824
If you like her,

270
00:12:26,103 --> 00:12:27,663
if you can take care of her
for the rest of your life,

271
00:12:27,944 --> 00:12:28,864
I'll tell you the truth.

272
00:12:34,184 --> 00:12:35,143
I like her.

273
00:12:37,304 --> 00:12:39,064
But I only like her as an elder brother.

274
00:12:40,543 --> 00:12:41,624
If you're worried

275
00:12:41,624 --> 00:12:42,903
that no one will take care of her
in the future,

276
00:12:43,264 --> 00:12:44,864
I can give you my promise.

277
00:12:45,504 --> 00:12:46,624
As a doctor,

278
00:12:46,944 --> 00:12:48,143
I will take care of her
for the rest of my life.

279
00:12:49,744 --> 00:12:50,608
That won't do.

280
00:12:51,184 --> 00:12:52,744
This kind of promise isn't reliable.

281
00:12:52,984 --> 00:12:53,984
But who can promise

282
00:12:53,984 --> 00:12:55,343
that love will last forever?

283
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:58,703
I first met Meng Meng
in the supermarket.

284
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,944
I almost caused her death
due to my misjudgment.

285
00:13:01,543 --> 00:13:03,064
Since then, I told myself

286
00:13:03,944 --> 00:13:06,744
that she would be the first patient I
would take care for the rest of my life.

287
00:13:07,864 --> 00:13:09,504
I will do my best to cure her.

288
00:13:11,504 --> 00:13:12,504
You don't understand her.

289
00:13:15,864 --> 00:13:17,064
She doesn't have any self-respect.

290
00:13:17,064 --> 00:13:18,184
Don't say that.

291
00:13:20,504 --> 00:13:22,064
All of us have the possibility

292
00:13:22,064 --> 00:13:23,824
of being led astray.

293
00:13:24,064 --> 00:13:25,424
We pulled through as well.

294
00:13:26,064 --> 00:13:27,023
It's not her choice

295
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:28,184
to encounter a jerk.

296
00:13:29,304 --> 00:13:30,504
That's not what I meant.

297
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:50,463
Do you think she'll have a future

298
00:13:50,824 --> 00:13:51,984
if you lock her up

299
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:53,783
and install iron bars in the house?

300
00:13:57,304 --> 00:13:59,424
You promised me that you would
send her back to school.

301
00:14:00,051 --> 00:14:00,999
Professor Ren,

302
00:14:01,624 --> 00:14:03,223
she can't go to school.

303
00:14:03,264 --> 00:14:04,504
Why?

304
00:14:05,864 --> 00:14:06,864
After she was born,

305
00:14:06,864 --> 00:14:07,944
her mother and I

306
00:14:08,504 --> 00:14:10,744
bought a life insurance policy for her
that would last until she was 18.

307
00:14:11,264 --> 00:14:13,023
Yesterday, the insurance agent
called me.

308
00:14:13,384 --> 00:14:14,744
He said he took out the money

309
00:14:15,064 --> 00:14:16,504
as per Meng Meng's request.

310
00:14:17,624 --> 00:14:18,624
I thought something was off.

311
00:14:19,064 --> 00:14:20,463
I proceeded to investigate the case.

312
00:14:20,543 --> 00:14:22,463
She has a bank card

313
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,864
that we use to store the money
from her red packets.

314
00:14:23,984 --> 00:14:26,504
She took out all the money in it.

315
00:14:26,703 --> 00:14:28,583
That's why I hurriedly brought her back

316
00:14:28,624 --> 00:14:29,984
from your place that day.

317
00:14:31,984 --> 00:14:33,384
Didn't you guys ask her

318
00:14:34,184 --> 00:14:36,064
why she needed so much money?

319
00:14:36,424 --> 00:14:37,296
We did.

320
00:14:37,384 --> 00:14:38,264
She didn't want to tell us.

321
00:14:39,304 --> 00:14:41,504
But I'm sure it's related
to the man she met.

322
00:14:41,744 --> 00:14:42,744
Why do you think so?

323
00:14:43,264 --> 00:14:44,384
We caught her.

324
00:14:45,424 --> 00:14:47,143
When her mother switched on
the surveillance camera,

325
00:14:47,384 --> 00:14:48,744
she smashed it with the iron spoon

326
00:14:48,744 --> 00:14:50,343
we gave her together with her meal.

327
00:14:50,984 --> 00:14:52,903
Her mother confiscated her phone.

328
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:54,703
We hired someone to unlock her phone.

329
00:14:54,984 --> 00:14:57,064
We discovered that her chat records

330
00:14:57,064 --> 00:14:58,264
with that man have been deleted.

331
00:14:59,304 --> 00:15:00,944
If so, have you retrieved

332
00:15:00,944 --> 00:15:02,184
the content of the chat records?

333
00:15:02,624 --> 00:15:04,064
She's already 18 years old.

334
00:15:04,424 --> 00:15:05,424
The operation counter

335
00:15:05,624 --> 00:15:07,783
no longer allows us to retrieve
such records even as her parents.

336
00:15:09,064 --> 00:15:10,624
Have you considered this then?

337
00:15:11,064 --> 00:15:12,184
How would you feel

338
00:15:12,384 --> 00:15:14,184
if there was a surveillance camera

339
00:15:14,184 --> 00:15:16,143
monitoring you all day long?

340
00:15:22,064 --> 00:15:23,864
There must be a sense of boundary

341
00:15:24,864 --> 00:15:27,103
between parents and children.

342
00:15:27,504 --> 00:15:28,984
She's not a product.

343
00:15:33,064 --> 00:15:33,936
Professor Ren,

344
00:15:34,424 --> 00:15:36,824
we installed a surveillance camera
in her room for a reason.

345
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:51,504
During her puberty,

346
00:15:51,504 --> 00:15:53,023
I discovered

347
00:15:53,023 --> 00:15:54,624
this vile habit of hers.

348
00:15:56,064 --> 00:15:57,824
It was something unspeakable.

349
00:15:59,744 --> 00:16:01,184
This is normal.

350
00:16:02,264 --> 00:16:03,663
Everyone has desires.

351
00:16:04,184 --> 00:16:05,663
You have to acknowledge the fact
that she was growing up.

352
00:16:06,744 --> 00:16:08,424
That's a natural process.

353
00:16:08,424 --> 00:16:09,903
Why is it unspeakable?

354
00:16:10,824 --> 00:16:12,064
That will never do.

355
00:16:14,744 --> 00:16:16,463
What if you had a son instead?

356
00:16:17,103 --> 00:16:18,944
Can you accept him
for having such needs then?

357
00:16:23,543 --> 00:16:24,522
Madam Du,

358
00:16:25,424 --> 00:16:27,304
Meng Meng didn't do anything wrong.

359
00:16:27,543 --> 00:16:28,903
Your sense of shame

360
00:16:29,023 --> 00:16:30,504
made her think that
she had committed a mistake.

361
00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:32,783
She didn't harm anyone.

362
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:35,624
But Meng Meng

363
00:16:35,824 --> 00:16:37,223
wasn't willing to stay at home.

364
00:16:37,744 --> 00:16:38,663
She just spent her time

365
00:16:38,984 --> 00:16:41,023
with boys all day long.

366
00:16:41,184 --> 00:16:42,304
This happened

367
00:16:42,463 --> 00:16:44,103
all because we didn't notice it sooner.

368
00:16:44,424 --> 00:16:46,184
This shouldn't be coming from a girl

369
00:16:46,184 --> 00:16:47,543
who was born in
an educated family like ours.

370
00:16:47,703 --> 00:16:49,184
You and your husband
can't accept the fact

371
00:16:49,184 --> 00:16:50,624
that your child isn't like you two, huh?

372
00:16:51,663 --> 00:16:53,903
What's with the excessive
vanity and pride?

373
00:17:08,703 --> 00:17:10,384
In university, I excelled
at taking exams.

374
00:17:11,783 --> 00:17:13,663
And, I depended on my thesis
to obtain professional titles.

375
00:17:13,984 --> 00:17:15,304
Her mother is an appraiser.

376
00:17:15,864 --> 00:17:18,184
She has obtained countless
qualifications along the way.

377
00:17:18,384 --> 00:17:19,543
However, you don't need qualifications

378
00:17:19,543 --> 00:17:21,103
to be a parent.

379
00:17:21,703 --> 00:17:22,824
We've never received

380
00:17:22,824 --> 00:17:24,103
such professional training either.

381
00:17:24,103 --> 00:17:24,968
To be honest,

382
00:17:25,424 --> 00:17:26,384
we already have no idea

383
00:17:26,384 --> 00:17:27,944
which way is the correct way

384
00:17:27,944 --> 00:17:29,424
of loving her.

385
00:17:30,064 --> 00:17:32,184
Do you think we don't love our daughter?

386
00:17:33,543 --> 00:17:34,504
Now, you might think

387
00:17:34,504 --> 00:17:35,624
that we're harsh to her.

388
00:17:37,663 --> 00:17:39,064
But we do love her very much.

389
00:17:44,388 --> 00:17:45,424
I'm really confused.

390
00:17:47,864 --> 00:17:49,543
How could a family like ours

391
00:17:49,543 --> 00:17:51,783
nurture such a different daughter?

392
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:54,984
Sometimes, I felt distant

393
00:17:55,624 --> 00:17:57,304
when I looked at her.

394
00:17:57,304 --> 00:17:59,663
I felt like she wasn't even my daughter.

395
00:18:02,424 --> 00:18:03,384
Actually,

396
00:18:05,264 --> 00:18:06,864
I experienced

397
00:18:08,384 --> 00:18:09,264
the same thing.

398
00:18:10,744 --> 00:18:11,744
I'm a doctor.

399
00:18:12,143 --> 00:18:14,504
And, my wife comes from a line
of TCM practitioners.

400
00:18:15,064 --> 00:18:16,264
(Back then, I thought)

401
00:18:17,184 --> 00:18:19,944
(my son was supposed to be born with)

402
00:18:20,744 --> 00:18:22,023
(the essence of a medical practitioner.)

403
00:18:22,264 --> 00:18:24,223
(He should be an excellent doctor.)

404
00:18:24,504 --> 00:18:26,384
It's because he has all the conditions

405
00:18:26,424 --> 00:18:27,424
to make it work.

406
00:18:27,984 --> 00:18:28,811
However,

407
00:18:29,824 --> 00:18:30,984
even now,

408
00:18:32,184 --> 00:18:33,624
I don't sense

409
00:18:34,663 --> 00:18:37,744
the potential in him
to be a great doctor.

410
00:18:38,504 --> 00:18:40,504
But at least he can make a living.

411
00:18:41,423 --> 00:18:42,904
Meng Meng can't survive by herself.

412
00:18:43,504 --> 00:18:44,384
If this time,

413
00:18:44,984 --> 00:18:46,303
we cannot correct her behaviour,

414
00:18:46,664 --> 00:18:48,703
she'll have no future.

415
00:18:50,024 --> 00:18:51,504
We're growing old.

416
00:18:51,504 --> 00:18:53,144
We can't take care of her forever.

417
00:18:53,664 --> 00:18:55,624
If something happens to me,

418
00:18:56,504 --> 00:18:57,864
she might live on the streets.

419
00:18:58,264 --> 00:18:59,703
She might join the crooks
on the streets.

420
00:19:00,024 --> 00:19:01,504
I'm sure I cannot rest in peace

421
00:19:01,504 --> 00:19:02,640
even when I'm in the afterworld.

422
00:19:05,384 --> 00:19:07,063
We must correct her behaviour this time.

423
00:19:09,544 --> 00:19:10,784
So, if you cannot correct her behaviour,

424
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:12,544
will you lock her up

425
00:19:13,384 --> 00:19:14,504
and suffocate her with a cloth?

426
00:19:16,664 --> 00:19:19,544
I know you graduated
from a famous university.

427
00:19:20,544 --> 00:19:22,103
And, you have a successful career.

428
00:19:22,504 --> 00:19:24,504
But all of that

429
00:19:25,144 --> 00:19:28,024
have no substantial ties
to your daughter, right?

430
00:19:31,544 --> 00:19:33,063
In a family, it doesn't matter

431
00:19:33,744 --> 00:19:35,904
who's the smartest or
who contributes the most to the family.

432
00:19:36,144 --> 00:19:37,864
It's about the amount of love

433
00:19:38,024 --> 00:19:38,984
you provide.

434
00:19:39,904 --> 00:19:42,144
Did you put down everything,

435
00:19:42,144 --> 00:19:44,024
including your theses

436
00:19:44,904 --> 00:19:46,264
and work

437
00:19:46,384 --> 00:19:47,744
to keep your daughter company

438
00:19:47,904 --> 00:19:49,664
when she needed your love the most?

439
00:20:00,664 --> 00:20:01,655
Professor Ren,

440
00:20:03,504 --> 00:20:04,544
I wish to ask you something.

441
00:20:05,664 --> 00:20:07,103
How much time do you

442
00:20:07,144 --> 00:20:09,144
actually spend with Tian Zhen?

443
00:20:10,183 --> 00:20:11,063
I don't mean anything else.

444
00:20:11,624 --> 00:20:12,904
I just wish to understand

445
00:20:13,784 --> 00:20:15,144
the gap between me

446
00:20:15,784 --> 00:20:17,544
and other people's fathers.

447
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:25,904
Doctors don't treat themselves.

448
00:20:28,744 --> 00:20:30,423
I'm a selfish mother.

449
00:20:30,544 --> 00:20:32,144
I truly wish

450
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:33,544
that a positive boy

451
00:20:33,624 --> 00:20:35,463
with a good personality
and background like you

452
00:20:35,463 --> 00:20:37,864
will fall for her

453
00:20:37,864 --> 00:20:39,904
and save her from the abyss.

454
00:20:39,904 --> 00:20:40,864
Madam Du,

455
00:20:41,024 --> 00:20:43,223
you cannot expect
another person to save her.

456
00:20:43,384 --> 00:20:45,343
It's wrong of you to think so.

457
00:20:47,984 --> 00:20:49,024
Now, I know.

458
00:20:49,784 --> 00:20:52,183
Your constant denial of her worth
is the cause of her issue.

459
00:20:52,647 --> 00:20:53,943
It's because she can never satisfy

460
00:20:53,943 --> 00:20:55,144
your expectations.

461
00:20:56,024 --> 00:20:57,303
She's disappointed in herself.

462
00:20:57,303 --> 00:20:59,144
That's why she forsakes herself

463
00:21:00,024 --> 00:21:00,984
with such a demeaning method.

464
00:21:04,904 --> 00:21:05,843
Dr Ren,

465
00:21:06,384 --> 00:21:07,223
my husband and I

466
00:21:07,423 --> 00:21:09,384
have made a lot of money
all these years.

467
00:21:09,664 --> 00:21:11,063
As long as you're nice to her,

468
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:12,624
everything will be yours.

469
00:21:13,264 --> 00:21:14,423
I'm Meng Meng's mother.

470
00:21:14,423 --> 00:21:15,544
I understand her.

471
00:21:15,544 --> 00:21:16,544
She trusts you.

472
00:21:16,703 --> 00:21:18,664
Now, you're the only one
who can save her.

473
00:21:19,384 --> 00:21:20,703
If you become her boyfriend...

474
00:21:20,744 --> 00:21:21,600
Madam Du,

475
00:21:22,504 --> 00:21:23,984
love cannot be bought with money.

476
00:21:28,664 --> 00:21:29,864
I already have someone I fancy.

477
00:21:31,784 --> 00:21:32,744
I knew it.

478
00:21:33,904 --> 00:21:35,423
An excellent boy like you

479
00:21:36,024 --> 00:21:36,904
has plenty of suitors.

480
00:21:36,904 --> 00:21:37,725
That's not true.

481
00:21:39,264 --> 00:21:40,264
I like her.

482
00:21:41,904 --> 00:21:43,063
But she might not like me.

483
00:21:49,784 --> 00:21:50,632
Hello?

484
00:21:54,664 --> 00:21:55,468
Hello?

485
00:22:01,823 --> 00:22:02,686
What?

486
00:22:05,984 --> 00:22:06,858
What?

487
00:22:07,264 --> 00:22:08,103
What did you say?

488
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:21,019
(Jiangzhou People's Hospital)

489
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:34,984
Meng Meng!

490
00:23:21,744 --> 00:23:22,544
Meng Meng!

491
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:33,904
Meng Meng!

492
00:23:34,784 --> 00:23:35,664
Meng Meng!

493
00:23:38,264 --> 00:23:40,144
Why did you abandon me?

494
00:23:41,103 --> 00:23:42,864
Why did you abandon me?

495
00:23:44,264 --> 00:23:46,384
-Meng Meng!
-She was fine at home!

496
00:23:46,384 --> 00:23:47,943
Why did you let her out?

497
00:23:48,784 --> 00:23:50,784
Although she's your child,

498
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:52,463
I was the one raising her!

499
00:23:52,784 --> 00:23:55,343
She looked so pitiful in her room!

500
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:56,482
You see,

501
00:23:56,744 --> 00:24:00,384
even dogs get to take walks every day.

502
00:24:00,784 --> 00:24:02,423
She's my daughter!

503
00:24:02,624 --> 00:24:03,544
I know her the best!

504
00:24:03,544 --> 00:24:06,063
Look at what you've done!

505
00:24:06,063 --> 00:24:08,544
I know. I know I shouldn't
take her outside.

506
00:24:09,864 --> 00:24:11,183
I just allowed her access

507
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:12,904
to the balcony on the second floor.

508
00:24:13,024 --> 00:24:15,264
She was still fine a few days ago.

509
00:24:15,264 --> 00:24:16,904
But for some reason,

510
00:24:16,904 --> 00:24:19,223
she scaled the outer wall today.

512
00:26:19,063 --> 00:26:19,904
Meng Meng?

513
00:26:20,183 --> 00:26:21,343
Do you still remember me?

514
00:26:23,024 --> 00:26:24,504
We met each other in the supermarket.

515
00:26:25,624 --> 00:26:26,504
My name is Ren Tian Zhen.

516
00:26:27,303 --> 00:26:28,233
Hello.

517
00:26:50,544 --> 00:26:51,624
Come here.

518
00:26:52,372 --> 00:26:53,264
Great-uncle,

519
00:26:53,544 --> 00:26:54,664
this is my patient.

520
00:26:54,664 --> 00:26:55,984
I can't let her stay here alone.

521
00:26:55,984 --> 00:26:56,784
I need to keep her company.

522
00:26:57,103 --> 00:26:58,054
You guys can enjoy your meal.

523
00:27:00,423 --> 00:27:01,335
It's fine.

524
00:27:01,744 --> 00:27:02,864
It's fine. It's me.

525
00:27:04,103 --> 00:27:04,975
It's fine.

526
00:27:12,544 --> 00:27:13,823
Meng Meng!

527
00:27:14,024 --> 00:27:15,024
Meng Meng, it's just an alarm.

528
00:27:15,024 --> 00:27:16,024
I've already switched it off. Meng Meng.

529
00:27:20,384 --> 00:27:21,744
Everything's fine now. Don't be scared.

530
00:28:09,904 --> 00:28:10,811
It's useless to toss it like that.

531
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:12,991
You got it!

532
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,885
(Qibo Medical Centre)

533
00:29:04,984 --> 00:29:05,850
Ms Xia.

534
00:29:06,173 --> 00:29:07,046
Oh yeah.

535
00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:08,039
Ms Xia, I need to ask you something.

536
00:29:08,223 --> 00:29:10,024
You didn't arrange any shifts
for me tomorrow, right?

537
00:29:10,303 --> 00:29:12,303
Don't worry. I didn't
arrange any for you.

538
00:29:13,544 --> 00:29:16,063
Zhao, you're going to meet
your first client tomorrow.

539
00:29:16,264 --> 00:29:17,823
I pray that you can close the deal.

540
00:29:18,063 --> 00:29:18,968
You can do it!

541
00:29:19,264 --> 00:29:20,744
Thank you, Ms Xia.
I hope it will come true.

542
00:29:20,784 --> 00:29:22,063
-You can do it!
-Goodbye.

543
00:29:22,063 --> 00:29:22,952
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

544
00:29:43,732 --> 00:29:44,624
You're back?

545
00:29:44,664 --> 00:29:45,544
You're back already?

546
00:29:46,264 --> 00:29:47,384
Isn't the medical centre busy today?

547
00:29:49,024 --> 00:29:51,063
Everyone is disheartened over
Meng Meng's passing.

548
00:29:51,984 --> 00:29:53,303
Ms Xia didn't assign
any extra patients to all doctors today.

549
00:29:53,904 --> 00:29:54,757
That's why I came back early.

550
00:29:58,024 --> 00:30:00,024
What happened to Meng Meng
was quite a shame.

551
00:30:01,144 --> 00:30:02,038
Yeah.

552
00:30:02,504 --> 00:30:03,784
If I were in her shoes,

553
00:30:04,264 --> 00:30:05,864
when I thought about my mother, father,

554
00:30:05,864 --> 00:30:06,749
and my brother,

555
00:30:07,024 --> 00:30:08,024
I didn't dare to take my life.

556
00:30:11,063 --> 00:30:11,921
Let me do it.

557
00:30:12,904 --> 00:30:14,303
-Be careful.
-I'll be fine.

558
00:30:19,423 --> 00:30:21,024
Tian Zhen has it the roughest among us.

559
00:30:21,784 --> 00:30:23,303
He didn't even come
to the medical centre today.

560
00:30:24,664 --> 00:30:25,864
I wonder how he's doing.

561
00:30:28,024 --> 00:30:28,968
Be careful.

562
00:30:50,264 --> 00:30:51,264
Hello, Granny?

563
00:30:51,864 --> 00:30:52,744
Tian Zhen.

564
00:30:53,744 --> 00:30:54,904
Where are you?

565
00:30:56,024 --> 00:30:57,504
I went out to take a breather.

566
00:30:58,423 --> 00:31:00,343
You went out to take a breather?

567
00:31:01,303 --> 00:31:03,343
When will you come back?

568
00:31:07,144 --> 00:31:07,984
Maybe after a few days.

569
00:31:08,144 --> 00:31:08,999
Don't worry.

570
00:31:09,744 --> 00:31:10,784
I just want

571
00:31:11,183 --> 00:31:12,303
to be alone for some time.

572
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:14,784
Be alone?

573
00:31:15,384 --> 00:31:17,194
Tian Zhen, you're so young.

574
00:31:17,303 --> 00:31:19,423
It's not time for you to be alone yet.

575
00:31:19,423 --> 00:31:20,463
Hurry and come back.

576
00:31:20,488 --> 00:31:21,368
Mum.

577
00:31:22,744 --> 00:31:23,784
(Wait a moment.)

578
00:31:27,303 --> 00:31:28,703
Hello, son?

579
00:31:31,904 --> 00:31:32,780
What's the matter?

580
00:31:34,384 --> 00:31:35,384
He hung up.

581
00:31:36,264 --> 00:31:37,144
He needs some time alone.

582
00:31:37,144 --> 00:31:38,103
Look at your son.

583
00:31:38,103 --> 00:31:38,984
Just give him some time.

584
00:31:39,784 --> 00:31:41,303
As a doctor,

585
00:31:42,664 --> 00:31:44,583
there are many times
when we will fail as well.

586
00:31:44,904 --> 00:31:46,423
If everyone acts like him,

587
00:31:47,144 --> 00:31:48,744
I think everyone
can pack their bags and resign.

588
00:31:49,664 --> 00:31:50,864
Do you think doctors

589
00:31:50,904 --> 00:31:52,624
are the only ones
who'll experience such emotions?

590
00:31:52,904 --> 00:31:54,904
No matter what emotion it is,
it shouldn't affect their job.

591
00:31:55,864 --> 00:31:57,784
As a man, and as a doctor,

592
00:31:57,784 --> 00:31:59,144
no matter what you encounter in life,

593
00:31:59,144 --> 00:32:00,664
you still have to return to work.

594
00:32:01,904 --> 00:32:02,784
He has to know

595
00:32:02,784 --> 00:32:04,264
that there are many patients out here
waiting to receive his treatment.

596
00:32:05,384 --> 00:32:06,423
What kind of child is this?

597
00:32:14,264 --> 00:32:15,303
Tell someone to find him.

598
00:32:16,984 --> 00:32:17,904
Who?

599
00:32:19,303 --> 00:32:20,943
Where can we find him?

600
00:32:22,624 --> 00:32:24,544
Phones nowadays cannot be used

601
00:32:24,544 --> 00:32:25,423
to determine one's location.

602
00:32:25,423 --> 00:32:26,784
If only we can know his whereabouts

603
00:32:27,183 --> 00:32:28,703
after calling him.

604
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:29,997
This...

605
00:32:36,144 --> 00:32:37,664
I know where he goes.

606
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:25,504
Ren Tian Zhen!

607
00:34:26,384 --> 00:34:27,423
Ren Tian Zhen!

608
00:34:33,984 --> 00:34:35,624
Ren Tian Zhen!

609
00:34:45,664 --> 00:34:46,784
Ren Tian Zhen!

610
00:34:56,198 --> 00:34:57,544
Ren Tian Zhen!

611
00:35:40,583 --> 00:35:41,624
Wake up!

612
00:35:42,904 --> 00:35:43,811
Wake up!

613
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:45,143
Wake up!

614
00:35:45,344 --> 00:35:46,143
Ren Tian Zhen!

615
00:35:46,383 --> 00:35:47,223
Ren Tian Zhen!

616
00:35:47,344 --> 00:35:48,663
Ren Tian Zhen! Wake up!

617
00:35:48,863 --> 00:35:50,744
Wake up!

618
00:35:53,344 --> 00:35:54,584
Ren Tian Zhen!

619
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:59,423
You terrified me!

620
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:07,744
Have you lost your mind?

621
00:36:07,984 --> 00:36:09,024
Have you lost your mind?

622
00:36:09,024 --> 00:36:10,143
Listen!

623
00:36:10,264 --> 00:36:12,344
You've crossed the line!

624
00:36:12,344 --> 00:36:13,383
Do you think you can take your life
without thinking?

625
00:36:13,383 --> 00:36:15,143
What about your grandparents?

626
00:36:15,143 --> 00:36:16,943
What about your parents?

627
00:36:17,264 --> 00:36:19,344
How could you jump into the lake?

628
00:36:19,544 --> 00:36:20,383
I wasn't fast enough

629
00:36:20,383 --> 00:36:22,183
to save you, you know?

630
00:36:22,183 --> 00:36:22,984
Ren Tian Zhen!

631
00:36:23,024 --> 00:36:24,423
Have you lost your mind?

632
00:36:24,423 --> 00:36:25,264
Get up!

633
00:36:25,344 --> 00:36:26,223
Get up!

634
00:36:27,344 --> 00:36:28,304
Get up!

635
00:36:29,344 --> 00:36:30,223
I just want to know

636
00:36:33,584 --> 00:36:35,304
how terrible it felt like

637
00:36:37,104 --> 00:36:38,264
when Meng Meng jumped off the building.

638
00:36:44,584 --> 00:36:45,504
I understand now.

639
00:36:46,744 --> 00:36:48,584
I'm not meant to be a doctor.

640
00:36:49,344 --> 00:36:50,383
My father was right.

641
00:36:51,824 --> 00:36:52,703
I was born

642
00:36:53,863 --> 00:36:55,104
a failure.

643
00:36:56,304 --> 00:36:58,104
The patient I was determined to save
died on me.

644
00:37:00,463 --> 00:37:02,344
And, I attempted this bungee
after much thought.

645
00:37:03,903 --> 00:37:05,663
I would've died if it weren't for you.

646
00:37:09,544 --> 00:37:10,824
No matter what I do,

647
00:37:14,064 --> 00:37:15,623
I will end up failing.

648
00:37:18,784 --> 00:37:20,903
My father said this once
during his lesson.

649
00:37:21,423 --> 00:37:23,544
When a person keeps succeeding,

650
00:37:23,903 --> 00:37:26,344
they'll magnify their strengths.

651
00:37:27,584 --> 00:37:29,663
They'll think that
everything they do is right.

652
00:37:30,784 --> 00:37:33,104
However, their capability only
played a small part in their success.

653
00:37:34,903 --> 00:37:36,104
They succeeded only because of luck.

654
00:37:39,264 --> 00:37:40,383
Your father said

655
00:37:42,064 --> 00:37:44,143
we must be watchful of our pride
and fear all the time.

656
00:37:46,064 --> 00:37:48,064
My father was talking about
the almighty truth.

657
00:37:50,344 --> 00:37:51,863
Some people are born lucky.

658
00:37:53,383 --> 00:37:54,343
For example, you.

659
00:37:56,544 --> 00:37:57,663
You always save the people

660
00:37:57,663 --> 00:37:58,984
around you.

661
00:38:00,064 --> 00:38:01,623
That's why you should become a doctor.

662
00:38:03,304 --> 00:38:04,623
Maybe I'm just unlucky.

663
00:38:07,344 --> 00:38:08,863
You're more like their child
compared to me.

664
00:38:20,183 --> 00:38:21,132
You're wrong.

665
00:38:22,143 --> 00:38:23,223
I wasn't not lucky.

666
00:38:24,824 --> 00:38:25,863
It wasn't luck.

667
00:38:27,423 --> 00:38:28,584
I just didn't give up.

668
00:38:29,264 --> 00:38:31,024
When I was standing on the mountaintop,

669
00:38:32,183 --> 00:38:33,463
I didn't see that your feet
were tied to a rope

670
00:38:33,663 --> 00:38:35,304
(when you jumped down.)

671
00:38:36,863 --> 00:38:38,064
If that's the case,

672
00:38:38,344 --> 00:38:39,504
even if I did rush here,

673
00:38:40,544 --> 00:38:41,903
you would've been dead anyhow.

674
00:38:42,143 --> 00:38:43,463
The correct thing for me to do

675
00:38:43,984 --> 00:38:44,866
was to call the cops.

676
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:46,744
But I didn't.

677
00:38:47,784 --> 00:38:48,784
I just kept running.

678
00:38:49,463 --> 00:38:50,272
(I kept running.)

679
00:38:50,824 --> 00:38:51,863
(My mind was totally blank.)

680
00:38:52,264 --> 00:38:53,383
(I just kept running.)

681
00:38:54,183 --> 00:38:55,863
(I would've broken the world record
for sprinting)

682
00:38:56,264 --> 00:38:58,064
if there was a timer.

683
00:38:59,863 --> 00:39:01,223
Your father said this as well.

684
00:39:02,104 --> 00:39:03,183
Every mother has the strength

685
00:39:03,183 --> 00:39:04,304
to lift a car and save their child

686
00:39:04,344 --> 00:39:06,104
when they need it.

687
00:39:07,744 --> 00:39:09,463
You thought I was lucky?

688
00:39:09,663 --> 00:39:10,744
That's not the case.

689
00:39:11,824 --> 00:39:13,584
I just didn't give up on you.

690
00:39:14,744 --> 00:39:15,585
I didn't

691
00:39:16,824 --> 00:39:17,903
give up on you.

692
00:39:19,064 --> 00:39:20,423
Stop denying your worth.

693
00:39:21,623 --> 00:39:23,024
No one can define who you are
but yourself.

694
00:39:23,984 --> 00:39:25,863
The fortune teller said this

695
00:39:27,663 --> 00:39:29,223
when we met him.

696
00:39:29,824 --> 00:39:31,824
He said you were a late bloomer.

697
00:39:32,423 --> 00:39:33,784
That means you still have

698
00:39:35,863 --> 00:39:37,024
a lot to achieve after this.

699
00:39:38,143 --> 00:39:39,463
So, you shouldn't rush things.

700
00:39:51,344 --> 00:39:52,663
I'm not as confident as you.

701
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:55,663
But I'm confident in you.

702
00:40:22,903 --> 00:40:23,757
What's wrong?

703
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:26,504
My tummy hurts.

704
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:29,459
Where?

705
00:40:30,304 --> 00:40:31,093
Here.

706
00:40:32,584 --> 00:40:33,584
When did it start to hurt?

707
00:40:36,722 --> 00:40:37,545
Tou Tou?

708
00:40:37,708 --> 00:40:38,546
Tou Tou!

709
00:40:38,663 --> 00:40:39,984
Where's your phone?

710
00:40:40,024 --> 00:40:41,824
Tou Tou, wake up!

711
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:43,623
Tou Tou, you mustn't fall asleep!

712
00:40:43,824 --> 00:40:45,143
Tou Tou, wake up!

713
00:40:49,383 --> 00:40:50,544
Is anyone around?

714
00:40:50,584 --> 00:40:51,640
Tou Tou!

715
00:40:53,264 --> 00:40:54,623
Is anyone around?

716
00:40:55,544 --> 00:40:57,064
Help!

717
00:40:58,584 --> 00:40:59,546
Tou Tou!

718
00:40:59,943 --> 00:41:00,984
Tou Tou, wake up!

719
00:41:01,824 --> 00:41:03,584
Tou Tou!

720
00:41:04,984 --> 00:41:06,183
Tou Tou, wake up!

721
00:41:06,623 --> 00:41:07,702
Tou Tou!

722
00:41:13,383 --> 00:41:14,383
She has a high fever.

723
00:41:14,784 --> 00:41:15,623
Apply it to her forehead.

724
00:41:15,784 --> 00:41:17,504
Rhubarb, peach pit, and winter melon?

725
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,560
Kid,

726
00:41:18,584 --> 00:41:19,863
that's too strong for her.

727
00:41:19,903 --> 00:41:21,544
How could you use so much rhubarb?

728
00:41:21,584 --> 00:41:22,824
You'll harm her!

729
00:41:22,824 --> 00:41:24,223
Are you sure you know what you're doing?

730
00:41:27,143 --> 00:41:28,824
No. We have to send her
to the hospital now.

731
00:41:30,183 --> 00:41:31,544
It's late now.

732
00:41:31,584 --> 00:41:33,463
No one in the village
is willing to drive.

733
00:41:33,504 --> 00:41:34,436
Yeah.

734
00:41:34,744 --> 00:41:36,344
Tell Gui

735
00:41:36,344 --> 00:41:37,383
to drive the vehicle here.

736
00:41:37,504 --> 00:41:38,544
How long does it take
to reach the hospital?

737
00:41:38,544 --> 00:41:39,584
Just borrow the car for me.
I can drive there myself.

738
00:41:39,784 --> 00:41:40,824
No, you won't be able to do it.

739
00:41:40,824 --> 00:41:42,264
-I...
-It's very far away.

740
00:41:42,383 --> 00:41:43,504
It's dark outside, and you'll be
driving across mountain terrains.

741
00:41:43,824 --> 00:41:44,780
This is too dangerous.

742
00:41:54,584 --> 00:41:56,183
It's an acute abdomen.
I don't know if I can treat you.

743
00:41:57,344 --> 00:41:59,183
It'll be troublesome if the wound
festers when I perform perforation.

744
00:41:59,544 --> 00:42:00,584
Let me send you to the hospital.

745
00:42:04,984 --> 00:42:06,143
We only have three hours.

746
00:42:07,304 --> 00:42:09,824
Driving at night or performing
perforation has equal risk.

747
00:42:19,943 --> 00:42:20,863
Tian Zhen.

748
00:42:24,663 --> 00:42:25,623
Give me a prescription.

749
00:42:27,183 --> 00:42:27,984
I'll take it.

750
00:42:30,447 --> 00:42:32,042
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

751
00:42:32,153 --> 00:42:33,529
(are referenced from relevant
traditional Chinese medicine books)

752
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,040
