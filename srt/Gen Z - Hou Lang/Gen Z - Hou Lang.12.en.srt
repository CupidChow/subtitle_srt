00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:35,083
(Gen Z)

2
00:01:35,811 --> 00:01:38,302
(Episode 12)

3
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:42,440
Take everything in moderation.

4
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,839
This is my reward for you.

5
00:01:45,048 --> 00:01:45,847
-Here.
-Alright.

6
00:01:45,919 --> 00:01:47,000
If so,

7
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,199
I'll take the entire pot.

8
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,639
I don't want to share it with you.

9
00:01:54,559 --> 00:01:55,362
Just pour a little for me.

10
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:56,680
-Come on.
-Take everything in moderation.

11
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,720
You said so yourself.

12
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,288
-Just a little more.
-Stop drinking.

13
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,839
-Just a little more.
-Stop drinking. Have some food.

14
00:02:01,905 --> 00:02:02,709
Alright.

15
00:02:02,839 --> 00:02:04,040
Your mouth is so oily.

16
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,120
Wipe your mouth.

17
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:06,639
Stop drinking.

18
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,320
Wait. What are you doing?

19
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,219
Hey.

20
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,399
There's not much left.

21
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,160
-Just a little.
-Just a little?

22
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,565
-Yeah.
-Just a little, okay?

23
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,199
Only a little.

24
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,040
That's enough.

25
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:19,455
That's too much.

26
00:02:21,399 --> 00:02:22,600
Cheers.

27
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,039
You don't understand, right?

28
00:02:24,679 --> 00:02:26,399
Cheers is what they say in English.

29
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,533
Cheers.

30
00:02:33,559 --> 00:02:34,839
How much did you drink?

31
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,440
How did you get so drunk?

32
00:02:37,279 --> 00:02:39,160
I'll make some hangover soup for you.

33
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:18,870
Here.

34
00:03:19,839 --> 00:03:20,720
Drink this.

35
00:03:27,119 --> 00:03:29,119
Don't you know how much liquor

36
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,960
you can drink?

37
00:03:31,839 --> 00:03:33,759
I'm teaching students in accordance

38
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,839
with their aptitude.

39
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,479
First, I lure her in with desire.

40
00:03:41,119 --> 00:03:44,240
After that, I'll bring her to
the righteous path.

41
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,759
Tou Tou is a promising child.

42
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,160
It's just that it's difficult

43
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,919
to be her teacher.

44
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,520
Look at me.

45
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,520
I'm giving everything I got

46
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,160
to realise Master's dream.

47
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,240
I've never seen you put this much effort

48
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,320
in teaching Tian Zhen.

49
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:04,320
It's because I know

50
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,160
Tian Zhen

51
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,559
belongs here.

52
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:11,880
He can't run away.

53
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,480
But Tou Tou?

54
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,760
She might run away

55
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,959
if we take our eyes off her.

56
00:04:20,679 --> 00:04:21,519
I think

57
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,519
you're sure that I won't run away.

58
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,160
That's why you make
endless demands of me.

59
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,279
Dear, that sounds unfair to me.

60
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:30,320
Unfair?

61
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,160
Was I wrong?

62
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,679
You put so much effort

63
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,359
in treating outsiders.

64
00:04:38,359 --> 00:04:39,519
What about your family?

65
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,679
This is

66
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:46,119
a common problem among humans.

67
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,760
We always show outsiders

68
00:04:48,119 --> 00:04:50,119
our best side

69
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:53,079
and show our family members
our worst side.

70
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:00,079
Don't think

71
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:01,959
that I invited Tou Tou to drink with me

72
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:03,760
so that I could transform her.

73
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:06,799
I was cleaning up the mess
your son had made.

74
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,519
If so, why didn't you let him

75
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,160
treat the girl during the forum?

76
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,480
So, you were waiting
to say that all along?

77
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,839
I was wondering

78
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:19,160
why everything

79
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,320
wasn't proceeding smoothly lately.

80
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,320
Your son wasn't ready yet.

81
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,679
If you don't let him give it a try,

82
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:27,040
he'll never be ready.

83
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,119
Both you

84
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:31,119
and Uncle were around.

85
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,600
And, he wanted to send Tian Zhen
to give the girl a diagnosis.

86
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,880
He wanted to see how capable
Tian Zhen was.

87
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,720
You only look on the bright side.

88
00:05:41,559 --> 00:05:42,880
What if your son

89
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:45,239
made things worse?

90
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:46,959
If Tou Tou made things worse,

91
00:05:47,239 --> 00:05:49,519
everyone could at least
come to terms with it.

92
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:51,040
I could back her up.

93
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,040
But if I send your son there

94
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,519
and back him up,

95
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:56,839
the Song family

96
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:58,119
will be embarrassed.

97
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,519
I didn't send your son there

98
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,160
in order to protect him.

99
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,959
Goodness.

100
00:06:07,239 --> 00:06:08,559
This concerns the girl's life, you know?

101
00:06:09,239 --> 00:06:10,559
Listen.

102
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,519
I'll tell you this.

103
00:06:14,559 --> 00:06:16,880
Although Tou Tou is boorish,

104
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,559
she's talented.

105
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,559
She's talented

106
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,600
and she's meant to take this path.

107
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:24,880
She might be distracted

108
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,839
during our lessons,

109
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,160
however, she has a delicate heart.

110
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,200
Her eyes and ears were open
and receptive.

111
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,720
She remembered everything

112
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,480
I said and taught.

113
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,119
Not only did she observe what I taught,

114
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:39,956
but she could also apply them.

115
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,920
She observed that Mr Zheng's daughter

116
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,720
had eczema.

117
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,119
When your son was there,

118
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,541
he only said

119
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,868
that she had a fever.

120
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:50,279
He may be able to cure her fever,

121
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:51,839
but he'll never think of

122
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,920
making egg yolk oil on the scene

123
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,760
and letting the girl apply it.

124
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:56,839
Do you think he'll think of that?

125
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,600
He'll never think of that.

126
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,040
The people there might have

127
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,920
a doctorate or a Master's degree,

128
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:03,880
but none of them

129
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,959
can do any better than Tou Tou.

130
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You're excited and proud

131
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,399
when you talk about Sun Tou Tou.

132
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,359
You feel like throwing up again?

133
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,853
I'll go to the toilet.

134
00:07:28,119 --> 00:07:29,279
Li Quan applied for leave again?

135
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,559
Yes, this is already the second time
this month.

136
00:07:31,559 --> 00:07:32,399
And, he applied for leave once

137
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:33,279
during our weekend lesson.

138
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,848
Tian Zhen,

139
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,160
did you know that Li Quan
applied for leave?

140
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,600
I know that.

141
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,942
Where did he go?

142
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,325
He...

143
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:44,880
He's doing a part-time job.

144
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,920
A part-time job?

145
00:07:49,559 --> 00:07:50,440
What does that mean?

146
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:53,105
He's doing foot massages.

147
00:07:53,216 --> 00:07:54,098
Dr Song,

148
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:55,559
someone left their belongings
in the storeroom.

149
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:56,417
Come and take a look.

150
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:05,959
Call Zhao Li Quan.

151
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,519
Tell him to pack his belongings.

152
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,040
How could he keep them here?

153
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,279
This is a medical centre, not a hotel.

154
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:16,760
The medicine we use
will be consumed by the patients.

155
00:08:19,119 --> 00:08:21,279
Where will he stay then?

156
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:22,160
Take his things out.

157
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,119
How is that my business?

158
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:27,133
Tian Zhen,

159
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,480
is Li Quan facing any difficulties?

160
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,119
I lent him my dorm last time.

161
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,679
But the dorm had tight security.

162
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,599
I told him to stay here
for the time being.

163
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,320
I think he's going to rent a unit soon.

164
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,159
That's why he applied for leave

165
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:41,000
in order to work outside.

166
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:43,039
He should find a job

167
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,119
with stable income.

168
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,159
He can come and learn

169
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,239
when he has time.

170
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:51,400
If so, you can just give him a job.

171
00:08:52,119 --> 00:08:53,599
Just make him a pharmaceutical worker.

172
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,280
He can prepare prescriptions.

173
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:56,960
He can study at the same time.

174
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,000
And, he'll make some money too.

175
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,960
Isn't that the best of both worlds?

176
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,200
Zhao Li Quan will be
a doctor in the future.

177
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:07,599
He can't just steal other people's jobs.

178
00:09:07,599 --> 00:09:08,440
Go and ask him.

179
00:09:09,719 --> 00:09:10,599
It's either he continues his study

180
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:12,046
or works outside.

181
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,719
You're discriminating against him here.

182
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,320
Why can Peng Shi Yan work
while studying then?

183
00:09:17,359 --> 00:09:18,520
Why can't Zhao Li Quan do the same?

184
00:09:19,599 --> 00:09:21,440
Peng Shi Yan

185
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,840
doesn't make a living
as a TCM practitioner.

186
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,440
TCM is Zhao Li Quan's livelihood.

187
00:09:26,719 --> 00:09:27,840
He needs medical skills

188
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,719
to make a living, understood?

189
00:09:31,239 --> 00:09:32,640
I think Tian Zhen's suggestion

190
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,359
is worth considering.

191
00:09:35,359 --> 00:09:36,960
It might work.

192
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,760
If Li Quan is around,

193
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,479
at least he can help us out

194
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:42,880
when we're busy preparing prescriptions.

195
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,840
He's familiar with herbs and medicine.

196
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,599
And, he was professionally trained
in this field.

197
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:49,640
He can prepare prescriptions

198
00:09:49,719 --> 00:09:50,799
when we give diagnoses.

199
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:52,679
He can study with the other classmates

200
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:53,919
when there's a class.

201
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:55,599
This is our place after all.

202
00:09:56,239 --> 00:09:58,479
We can pay him according to
a part-timer's rate.

203
00:09:58,479 --> 00:09:59,440
What do you think?

204
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:01,719
Niece-in-law already said so much.

205
00:10:01,719 --> 00:10:02,559
Nephew,

206
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:04,359
why don't you consider it?

207
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,919
Why are you calling me Nephew again?

208
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:11,599
Because it's time for me
to show my authority as your senior.

209
00:10:19,599 --> 00:10:21,440
I know you guys are
doing this for his sake.

210
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,520
But the thing is,

211
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,559
Zhao Li Quan

212
00:10:25,719 --> 00:10:28,159
must understand what he truly desires.

213
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:29,599
That's the main thing.

214
00:10:29,816 --> 00:10:30,667
That's it for now.

215
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,464
Call him.

216
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,239
He can't stay here.

217
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:42,599
So, does that mean

218
00:10:42,599 --> 00:10:43,559
your father has agreed to it?

219
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:46,520
Your seniority does work wonders.

220
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,880
You've been applying for leave

221
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,039
just to work here?

222
00:11:03,359 --> 00:11:04,204
Quit the job.

223
00:11:04,719 --> 00:11:06,559
You're a postgraduate student
from a decent medical academy.

224
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:08,719
Why are you working
in a massage parlour?

225
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,359
I'll get you a decent job.

226
00:11:10,359 --> 00:11:11,280
-Come with me.
-Tian Zhen.

227
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:15,692
Thank you.

228
00:11:16,599 --> 00:11:17,960
You always helped me out.

229
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,159
I feel pretty bad about it.

230
00:11:19,719 --> 00:11:20,599
I appreciate your kindness,

231
00:11:20,599 --> 00:11:21,479
but I'm doing great here.

232
00:11:21,479 --> 00:11:22,302
Doing great?

233
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:23,479
You apply for leave during the day.

234
00:11:23,479 --> 00:11:24,799
You don't even attend
our lessons on the weekend.

235
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,960
My father was unhappy that
you applied for leave today.

236
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,159
Besides, if you work at night,

237
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:30,000
you won't have the energy to
attend class on the second day.

238
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,840
If there's a situation in your family,

239
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,799
-you can tell me.
-Tian Zhen.

240
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:33,639
I can help you out.

241
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:39,479
I know you're doing it for my sake.

242
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:43,080
But it's not like I can accept your help

243
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:46,400
every time without any pressure.

244
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:51,400
I'm a man too. I have my dignity.

245
00:11:51,599 --> 00:11:52,880
You said this yourself.

246
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,479
You said you would find a mentor
in the apprentice class

247
00:11:54,479 --> 00:11:55,799
and ask them to take you
under their wing.

248
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:56,960
How could you learn from them

249
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,760
when you're doing this?

250
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:00,960
I do want to get a mentor

251
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,159
and learn under them.

252
00:12:03,359 --> 00:12:05,479
However, I need to survive first.

253
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,520
You saw this yourself.

254
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:09,520
I've always been working outside.

255
00:12:10,599 --> 00:12:11,719
It was different when I was in college.

256
00:12:11,719 --> 00:12:12,640
Back then, I was just
providing for myself.

257
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,520
I didn't need to provide for my family.

258
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,440
Now, it's different.

259
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,039
Now, I have to make money
and provide for my family.

260
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,440
Forget it. Let's drop the topic.

261
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,400
You won't understand anyway.

262
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,559
Your starting point is the endpoint
I've been trying to achieve.

263
00:12:23,599 --> 00:12:24,840
Wait. What did you say?

264
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,280
-Wait.
-This is...

265
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,400
What are you guys saying?

266
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,840
You guys are going off-topic here.

267
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,119
It's way off-topic.

268
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:36,039
Is it that complicated?

269
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,679
Do you wish to find

270
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:39,280
a way for you to study

271
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,840
and make money at the same time?

272
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,400
Right now, there's such a deal.

273
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,599
It can satisfy your need to study

274
00:12:44,719 --> 00:12:46,400
and help you make money too.
Do you want it or not?

275
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,320
Why are you here?

276
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,719
Why the heck are you here?

277
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:50,320
Didn't you come here

278
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,719
to help your friend?

279
00:12:51,719 --> 00:12:53,640
You already arranged
something for him, right?

280
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,440
Just tell him.

281
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,479
Tell him everything.

282
00:12:56,479 --> 00:12:57,320
Tell him both the pros and cons.

283
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,039
Let him make the call.

284
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:00,960
He's the one making the call here,
not you.

285
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,239
Why are you acting like
you're his father?

286
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:05,159
But you!

287
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,159
You kept interrupting him

288
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:07,119
when he was trying

289
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,479
to tell you about it.

290
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,239
I was so fed up.

291
00:13:10,239 --> 00:13:12,719
Can't you just wait for him
to finish his words

292
00:13:12,719 --> 00:13:14,080
before you interrupt?

293
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,400
Just cut to the chase.

294
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,039
Don't talk about anything else.

295
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:24,440
You can work as a pharmaceutical worker
in my family's medical centre.

296
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,320
You can attend class when there's one.

297
00:13:26,919 --> 00:13:27,840
My father has already agreed to it.

298
00:13:32,599 --> 00:13:33,497
Thank you.

299
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,125
Thank you.

300
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:37,897
Don't mention it.

301
00:13:38,479 --> 00:13:39,447
Yeah.

302
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,960
Here you go.

303
00:13:41,719 --> 00:13:42,799
Isn't it simple?

304
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,320
You guys would've argued

305
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,880
for three hours if I weren't here.

306
00:13:47,479 --> 00:13:48,329
Quan,

307
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:50,359
you might not be able to
live in the medical centre anymore.

308
00:13:50,567 --> 00:13:51,368
That's fine.

309
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,080
I'll get my wage soon.

310
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,640
I'll stay in a cheap place
for the time being.

311
00:13:59,039 --> 00:13:59,922
Okay.

312
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,840
Fools.

313
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,146
Xing Xing.

314
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:02,880
We meet again.

315
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,719
Dear,

316
00:15:04,719 --> 00:15:05,640
you're here to pick me up?

317
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,440
Someone's following me.

318
00:15:17,239 --> 00:15:18,091
Is he gone?

319
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,840
He should be gone.

320
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:28,719
That was terrifying.

321
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,280
That guy followed me
all the way here from the subway.

322
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,479
He kept staring at me.

323
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,159
Listen. Next time, if you encounter
someone like him,

324
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:35,359
just stare at him.

325
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,200
People like him are timid.

326
00:15:37,599 --> 00:15:38,599
I'm not Tou Tou.

327
00:15:38,599 --> 00:15:40,080
I dare not stare at him.

328
00:15:45,479 --> 00:15:46,479
What are you doing here?

329
00:15:49,479 --> 00:15:50,316
I...

330
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,919
You must make sure
your centre of gravity

331
00:15:53,239 --> 00:15:55,080
is between your legs.

332
00:15:55,719 --> 00:15:56,616
Wait.

333
00:15:57,082 --> 00:15:58,520
Wait.

334
00:15:59,479 --> 00:16:00,366
Who's calling you?

335
00:16:02,479 --> 00:16:03,393
It's Xing Xing.

336
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,249
Hello?

337
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,960
Sun Tou Tou, what have you done?

338
00:16:12,599 --> 00:16:14,200
What do you mean
by sending a guy to my house?

339
00:16:15,239 --> 00:16:16,159
Xing Xing,

340
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:18,159
it's pretty late now.

341
00:16:18,479 --> 00:16:20,479
Have you taken dinner?

342
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,440
Did you work overtime again?

343
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,320
I'm sure it's tough on you.

344
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,719
I'm heartbroken.

345
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:27,239
Don't interrupt me.

346
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,335
Tell me.

347
00:16:28,479 --> 00:16:29,719
You sent a man to my house.

348
00:16:29,719 --> 00:16:30,760
What should I do?

349
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,239
(Xing Xing, listen.)

350
00:16:32,239 --> 00:16:35,479
Quan is so pitiful.

351
00:16:35,479 --> 00:16:37,159
Not only can he not afford food,

352
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:39,159
but he also
can't afford a place to stay.

353
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:41,159
(My bed is vacant anyway.)

354
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:42,440
(That's why I sent him there.)

355
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,960
(Can you take pity on him)

356
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,080
and take him in?

357
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,080
I promise.

358
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,559
He's a good guy.

359
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:49,840
He won't cross the line.

360
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,400
I don't know if he's a good guy or not,

361
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,520
but he's a guy.

362
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:55,559
(That's even better.)

363
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:58,239
I thought it was dangerous for you
to live alone.

364
00:16:58,479 --> 00:16:59,799
Now, there's a guy to protect you.

365
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,280
I can rest at ease now.

366
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,439
(And, Xing Xing, think about it.)

367
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,640
(He knows how to give massages.)

368
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,040
If you have issues like a stiff neck,

369
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,839
you don't even need to
go to the massage parlour.

370
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,000
Just stay at home.

371
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,560
First come, first served, right?

372
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,400
(Isn't it convenient?)

373
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,280
You'll land me in trouble eventually.

374
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,839
What? You expect me
to carry your luggage?

375
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:47,844
Slowly.

376
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:48,959
You must be careful when you go up.

377
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,280
-Come on.
-Let's continue.

378
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,839
Maintain your centre of gravity.

379
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:54,185
Okay.

380
00:17:56,599 --> 00:17:57,920
Feel the harmony between man and nature.

381
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,129
Say,

382
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:10,040
is chiropractic

383
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:10,920
the thing

384
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,839
where they pop the bones?

385
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,419
That's not it.

386
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,439
Ms Dong doesn't do that.

387
00:18:16,719 --> 00:18:18,239
It's dangerous when
you crack bones like that.

388
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,680
No, that's not what I mean.

389
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,520
I mean popping the bones.

390
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,599
There's a sound to it.

391
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:23,520
What's the difference between them?

392
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,920
Cracking

393
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,880
makes a different sound.

394
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,000
Popping makes a different sound.

395
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,959
That's the difference.

396
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,119
It's the same thing.

397
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:30,560
How could they be the same?

398
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,479
The difference is

399
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:34,239
that chiropractic is fake.

400
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:35,760
It's a lie.

401
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,599
It's already good enough

402
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,280
for massages and the likes
to help our bodies to relax.

403
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,760
We mustn't abuse

404
00:18:41,959 --> 00:18:43,839
the power of rumours.

405
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,680
It'll harm the people.

406
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:46,760
That's why I think

407
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,280
TCM practitioners
can focus on healthcare

408
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,680
while doctors can focus on treatments.

409
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:50,719
We should stay on our designated trails.

410
00:18:50,719 --> 00:18:51,880
Isn't that better?

411
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,439
I don't know about the others,

412
00:18:53,439 --> 00:18:55,119
but Ms Dong is a living deity.

413
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:56,280
If she does work her magic,

414
00:18:56,479 --> 00:18:58,359
you'll feel like you've been reborn.

415
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,439
I know her for many years.

416
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:01,359
I saw for myself

417
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:02,520
that patients in wheelchairs

418
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,160
could walk out of the room
after her treatment.

419
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,479
Guys, listen to him.

420
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:07,640
She used her hand
to restore the position of the bones,

421
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,119
and that could achieve
the effect of surgeries.

422
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:11,800
Don't you think it's ridiculous?

423
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,479
Even doctors can't guarantee

424
00:19:13,479 --> 00:19:15,319
that a cripple could walk out of
the room after surgery.

425
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,535
Pick it up.

426
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,160
Look. He's resorting to this
when he can't win the argument.

427
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,280
You deserved it.

428
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,439
Shi Yan, you'd better believe it.

429
00:19:37,439 --> 00:19:39,479
There's an old lady called Luo You Ming
in Shuangqiao, Beijing.

430
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:40,880
She could set bones

431
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,880
with just her hands.

432
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:44,359
Premier Zhou even
built a hospital for her.

433
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,560
She could

434
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,599
set fractures, even crushed bones

435
00:19:48,671 --> 00:19:49,551
and restore them.

436
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:51,359
Is that Ms Dong

437
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:53,319
as good as the old lady
in Shuangqiao, Beijing?

438
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,280
If that's the case, she's even better
than my nephew then.

439
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,760
Yeah.

440
00:19:57,119 --> 00:19:58,160
Is Mr Ren here?

441
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,839
This must be the classroom.

442
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,920
That's Zhu's car.

443
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,818
He's here?

444
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,479
Mr Ren!

445
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,400
I finally found you!

446
00:20:15,432 --> 00:20:16,398
Mr Zhu,

447
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,040
I thought we had an appointment
in the medical centre on Monday?

448
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,560
I couldn't sleep well

449
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,560
for the past few days.

450
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,439
(Zhu Chang Ming)
I was flustered.

451
00:20:22,479 --> 00:20:23,359
I couldn't wait any longer.

452
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,400
Mr Ren, please read my pulse.

453
00:20:26,385 --> 00:20:27,290
(Dong Hui Ci)
Check my pulse.

454
00:20:27,689 --> 00:20:28,553
Yeah.

455
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,719
I just received a batch of
top-quality cordyceps.

456
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,400
There are only 1,000 of them in one jin.

457
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,553
I bought 500,000 yuan
worth of cordyceps.

458
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,119
Should I consume it?

459
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,040
Or should I

460
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,640
consume the 60-years-old
wild ginseng I have?

461
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,470
What do you think?

462
00:20:41,098 --> 00:20:42,053
What about this?

463
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,880
You can tell us

464
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,280
the "tonics"

465
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,520
you think that are good for you

466
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,880
lately.

467
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,000
I took plenty of them.

468
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:52,040
Turtles,

469
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:52,880
ginseng,

470
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,959
dendrobium, sea cucumbers,

471
00:20:53,959 --> 00:20:54,880
I took everything.

472
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,040
So, do you feel better
after taking them?

473
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,239
Or do you feel uncomfortable?

474
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,000
It's like this.

475
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,800
I think it's only worth it

476
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,359
if I take such expensive tonics.

477
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:06,040
I make a lot of money.

478
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,000
What else should I spend them on
besides food?

479
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,040
So, you have too much money, huh?

480
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,880
You should do charity with them then.

481
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:13,280
You can donate to our apprentice class.

482
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,479
Mr Ren, it's like this.

483
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,560
I can't donate my money when I'm alive.

484
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,439
I'll donate everything to you

485
00:21:18,439 --> 00:21:20,040
once I'm dead.

486
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,400
Donating my money

487
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,880
is just like donating my organs.

488
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,400
I'll feel terrible.

489
00:21:25,479 --> 00:21:26,920
Zhu, you need to understand this.

490
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,000
Herbs and tonics are used

491
00:21:28,479 --> 00:21:30,400
to rectify a deviation.

492
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,400
Not all tonics can be consumed.

493
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,280
Judging from your current condition,

494
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,479
it's useless

495
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,680
to take any kind of tonics.

496
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,400
Even so, I have to take something.

497
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,520
Give me a prescription.

498
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,439
Give me a prescription.

499
00:21:41,479 --> 00:21:42,280
You?

500
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,800
Listen.

501
00:21:44,479 --> 00:21:46,640
Carrot and Chinese cabbages
are your best bet.

502
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,119
Seasonal and cheap ingredients

503
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:49,560
are best for you.

504
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,760
Just adjust your diet.

505
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,880
Take your meal on time
and sleep on time.

506
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,760
I can't sleep.

507
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,400
I wouldn't need to be here
if I could sleep in the first place.

508
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,642
What do you think?

509
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,239
Did you owe people money lately?

510
00:22:02,545 --> 00:22:03,369
No.

511
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,599
Did someone owe you money?

512
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,760
Are you afraid that
you can't get it back?

513
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,479
I can't treat that.

514
00:22:12,479 --> 00:22:13,520
Don't say that.

515
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,520
Mr Ren, you have to
do something about me.

516
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,479
You have to think of something.

517
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,160
You can't just ignore me.

518
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,160
What should I do then?

519
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,040
Give me a prescription.

520
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:25,359
Have you done some movements

521
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,280
that rotate your spine?

522
00:22:29,479 --> 00:22:31,000
What do you mean?

523
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,640
He plays golf.

524
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,359
Did you play golf for the past few days?

525
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,920
I play golf twice per week.

526
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,160
I stopped playing golf after last week

527
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,239
as I couldn't sleep.

528
00:22:41,239 --> 00:22:42,160
I didn't play golf this week.

529
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:43,920
Do you know something?

530
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:45,640
When you play golf,

531
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,119
you're rotating your spine

532
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,880
with this movement.

533
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,400
This movement

534
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,079
caused your thoracic vertebra
to shift to the wrong position.

535
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:55,160
And that has affected the function
of your lungs and heart.

536
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,239
That's why you couldn't sleep.

537
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,119
I'll restore them

538
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:00,359
to their original positions later.

539
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,280
You'll be able to sleep well tonight
after that.

540
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,599
You should give me a prescription.

541
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,839
If Ms Dong said she could treat you,

542
00:23:16,239 --> 00:23:18,040
she could definitely treat you.

543
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,520
Are you sure?

544
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,736
Guys,

545
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,719
for our chiropractic class,

546
00:23:29,719 --> 00:23:31,640
I've invited Ms Dong Hui Ci,

547
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,160
whom I respect a lot.

548
00:23:33,479 --> 00:23:34,880
She bumped into

549
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,520
a patient at the entrance.

550
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,520
She's treating him right now.

551
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,920
That's why

552
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,199
I'm doing the introduction.

553
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,719
Ms Dong is here. Let's welcome her.

554
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,394
Ms Dong,

555
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,680
how's the patient?

556
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,599
He's asleep.

557
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,719
Professor Song is looking after him.

558
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,614
Guys,

559
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,040
for today's class,

560
00:23:56,479 --> 00:23:59,000
it'll definitely be interesting and fun.

561
00:23:59,239 --> 00:24:00,760
We'll show you guys

562
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,880
that not only can chiropractic
treat illness,

563
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,719
but it can also treat major illnesses.

564
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,079
Just now, that patient said

565
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:09,880
he had insomnia.

566
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,400
After Ms Dong's treatment,

567
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,280
he's already

568
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,199
fallen asleep.

569
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:17,895
Okay.

570
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:18,920
I'll leave this class

571
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:20,640
to Ms Dong.

572
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,520
Ms Dong, I'll go and check on him.

573
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,520
Please go ahead.

574
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,312
Okay.

575
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:26,280
I always think that TCM practitioners
are mystifying things.

576
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:28,359
Say, was that Mr Zhu acting just now?

577
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,160
I assume you think

578
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,760
that I requested Professor Ren
to stage an act

579
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,640
to show off the skills of my sect.

580
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,719
That's not it. Actually,

581
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,239
with our skills,

582
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,640
we can cure many illnesses.

583
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,800
Ms Dong, not only
do you know chiropractic,

584
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,040
but you can also read lips.

585
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,800
Hello, everyone.

586
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,479
In our daily lives,

587
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:57,400
we'll often encounter situations

588
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,570
such as

589
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,239
moving a flower pot,

590
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,839
carrying a baby,

591
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:04,160
wearing your pants with one leg,

592
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,719
or realising that you couldn't move

593
00:25:06,719 --> 00:25:08,040
after waking up

594
00:25:08,377 --> 00:25:09,272
from a nap.

595
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:13,680
That's what we call a twisted waist.

596
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,880
There are often patients

597
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:19,160
who experience stuffy chests,

598
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,520
dizziness,

599
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,959
or bedridden due to leg pain

600
00:25:23,239 --> 00:25:24,520
due to misalignment of the spine.

601
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,640
As the saying goes,

602
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,719
it takes a hundred days for the bone
to knit and tendons to heal.

603
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,920
Some people might look like
they've recovered

604
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,880
after lying down for some time.

605
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,560
But in reality,

606
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,119
it became the root of other illnesses.

607
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,160
Ever since smartphones

608
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,760
and laptops

609
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,839
became essential parts of our lives,

610
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,719
even as an extension

611
00:25:47,719 --> 00:25:49,280
of our organs,

612
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,239
I could conclude

613
00:25:51,479 --> 00:25:52,479
that spondylosis

614
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,000
would be a common occurrence

615
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,719
in the future.

616
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,920
However, such illness

617
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,160
can be treated easily

618
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,359
with our methods.

619
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:08,079
As long as you give us enough time,

620
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:09,760
I can restore your spines

621
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,160
to their factory setting.

622
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,959
Ms Dong, you should sit down
and teach us.

623
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,079
Thank you.

624
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,239
However, chairs with wheels
underneath them

625
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,506
shouldn't be used.

626
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,439
Chairs like these

627
00:26:28,479 --> 00:26:30,680
are one of the main reasons

628
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,680
of waist and

629
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,359
and spinal issues.

630
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,280
Chinese characters are very meaningful.

631
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,920
I wish to talk about the character

632
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,760
"Zuo".

633
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,554
Tian Zhen,

634
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,160
can you come here

635
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,160
and write it down?

636
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:46,986
Okay.

637
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,119
Look.

638
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:00,520
The character "Zuo"

639
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,719
has two people
sitting on top of the earth.

640
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,479
Why are there two people?

641
00:27:06,479 --> 00:27:09,160
To balance things out.

642
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,479
Why must it be on top of the earth?

643
00:27:11,479 --> 00:27:14,119
Because it needs to be sturdy.

644
00:27:14,119 --> 00:27:16,760
For chairs with wheels like these,

645
00:27:17,479 --> 00:27:18,760
we need to use the strength

646
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,319
of our waist

647
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:23,800
to prevent it from moving.

648
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,319
But when we sit on it

649
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,479
and wish to move from here

650
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:32,400
to there,

651
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,560
it requires us

652
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,280
to have strong core strength.

653
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,760
What if you don't have

654
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,199
strong core strength?

655
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:40,520
What will you use then?

656
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,160
You'll use this part.

657
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,199
This is what we refer

658
00:27:45,239 --> 00:27:46,520
to as lumbar rotation.

659
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,319
It's this part.

660
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,479
This will cause

661
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,880
the spine to be misaligned easily.

662
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,880
So, for my sake,

663
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,040
I think it's better

664
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,880
to teach you guys while standing.

665
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,479
So, who has

666
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,680
waist issues

667
00:28:05,239 --> 00:28:06,280
among you all?

668
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,479
All of you?

669
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,800
Ms Dong, me.

670
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,335
Okay.

671
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,760
Tell me then.

672
00:28:17,479 --> 00:28:18,386
Over here?

673
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,680
Why are all these things still here?

674
00:28:21,719 --> 00:28:23,239
Who are you? What do you need?

675
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,560
We'll be renovating the place soon.

676
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,040
We're here to take measurements.

677
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,359
What measurements?

678
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,880
I'm not talking to you.

679
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,079
Take me the person in charge.

680
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:30,890
Wait.

681
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,640
Person in charge? That's me.

682
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,471
Let me see.

683
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,239
What is this?

684
00:28:38,239 --> 00:28:39,479
I'm the person in charge here.

685
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,760
Hello. It's like this.

686
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,280
Mr Liu told us

687
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,599
to renovate the place.

688
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,160
-Renovate the place?
-That's right.

689
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,239
I even brought the contract here.

690
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,781
Please take a look.

691
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,156
What about this?

692
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,599
Please wait here for a moment.

693
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:52,920
I'll call Mr Liu.

694
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,959
Okay.

695
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,280
Let's go and take a look.

696
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,400
Wait here.

697
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,640
Take a break for now.

698
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,000
Guys, take a break.

699
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,560
Liu,

700
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,479
are you using the classroom

701
00:29:14,479 --> 00:29:15,400
for

702
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,599
other purposes?

703
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,424
That's right.

704
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,479
I was just planning
to tell you about it.

705
00:29:20,479 --> 00:29:22,520
It's like this. I wish to renovate

706
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,680
the classroom.

707
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,839
After that, I'll rent it out.

708
00:29:26,365 --> 00:29:27,926
That's different from
what we agreed upon.

709
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:31,640
(Professor, you need to understand
my feelings too.)

710
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,400
Back then, I lent you the place

711
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,239
so that we could

712
00:29:35,239 --> 00:29:36,400
cooperate

713
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,880
and create a win-win situation.

714
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:41,439
(But you're uninterested in
the TCM industrial park)

715
00:29:41,439 --> 00:29:42,520
(and unwilling to join us.)

716
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,479
You see,

717
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,160
my capability and capital

718
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,920
is limited.

719
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:47,989
Besides,

720
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,479
I need to provide for

721
00:29:49,479 --> 00:29:50,760
my family

722
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,800
and the employees in my company.

723
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,000
I have to be responsible for them.

724
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,640
(It's tough to make a living nowadays.)

725
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,400
(If I do this, at least
I can collect some rent.)

726
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,239
You know this too. I'm passionate

727
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,000
toward TCM too.

728
00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:04,920
But my dear friend,

729
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,760
this might sound harsh,

730
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,640
but we can't make a living
with sentiment alone.

731
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,520
(That's why I could only rent it out)

732
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,319
(after renovating it.)

733
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,040
I have to rent the dorm out too

734
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,040
if it's possible.

735
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,655
You understand?

736
00:30:19,768 --> 00:30:20,790
Fine then.

737
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,380
What about this?

738
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,731
So,

739
00:30:38,479 --> 00:30:40,439
you three can wait outside
for the time being.

740
00:30:40,439 --> 00:30:41,640
Let me deal with them first.

741
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,319
-Alright.
-Thank you.

742
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:44,157
Guys.

743
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:45,341
Please.

744
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,800
Ms Dong, it's like this.

745
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,400
For the hands-on technique class,

746
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,880
we have to suspend it for now.

747
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,585
Guys, listen up.

748
00:30:58,599 --> 00:31:00,160
The apprentice class

749
00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:03,680
will be suspended for the time being.

750
00:31:04,359 --> 00:31:05,479
I'll notify you guys

751
00:31:05,479 --> 00:31:06,479
when our class reopens.

752
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,800
Charge!

753
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,000
Okay. Break.

754
00:31:13,239 --> 00:31:15,040
Ms Dong just told us

755
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,439
not to sit on this chair.

756
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:17,526
Only for a while.

757
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,473
What's going on?

758
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,880
Why are we having a sudden break?

759
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,760
I think everything's fine.

760
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:23,839
Don't worry.
My father will deal with it.

761
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,646
Tou!

762
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,837
Come here.

763
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,280
-Hurry up.
-Be careful.

764
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,534
What?

765
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,640
For this year's Qixi Festival,

766
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,400
they'll hold a lantern party
at the old street.

767
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,680
Initially, we had class.

768
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,839
Since God has given us

769
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:38,880
an excellent chance
by suspending our class,

770
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,719
why don't we head there
and enjoy ourselves?

771
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,764
You...

772
00:31:47,047 --> 00:31:47,968
You should've told me

773
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,239
about this earlier.

774
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,800
I heard

775
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,319
that we could even rent Hanfu there.

776
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:53,400
We should rent some Hanfu

777
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,640
and take some pictures
to commemorate the festival.

778
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,199
Who knows? Maybe this is our last class.

779
00:31:57,199 --> 00:31:58,084
Tou Tou,

780
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,959
don't jinx it.

781
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:00,828
Touch wood.

782
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,640
Meng Meng.

783
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,439
They're heading to the Qixi Festival
lantern party.

784
00:32:05,719 --> 00:32:06,560
Do you want to join them?

785
00:32:08,479 --> 00:32:09,920
But don't we need to apply for leave

786
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,160
from Mr Ren if we wish
to attend the event?

787
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,280
What leave?

788
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,479
-Mr Ren suspended the class.
-Yeah.

789
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,079
We don't even know
where the next class will be held at.

790
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:19,920
-Yeah.
-We should enjoy ourselves while we can.

791
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,800
That's right.

792
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,640
Let's go.

793
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,479
It's fun.

794
00:32:23,479 --> 00:32:24,880
There are all kinds of games there.

795
00:32:24,959 --> 00:32:26,959
And, they'll sell your
favourite food too.

796
00:32:27,239 --> 00:32:28,085
I'll go there with you.

797
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,308
Do you want to join them?

798
00:32:31,087 --> 00:32:31,915
Okay.

799
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,199
Why are you guys still standing there?

800
00:32:33,199 --> 00:32:34,359
Go and pack your things.

801
00:32:34,359 --> 00:32:35,160
Let's go.

802
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,341
Hurry up!

803
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,414
Rebecca,

804
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,839
you should come with us
to the Qixi Festival lantern party.

805
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:51,800
No, thanks. I'm not interested.

806
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,160
I advise you guys not to attend it.

807
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,040
Although we have a holiday,

808
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,400
we still have curfews.

809
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,280
Aren't you afraid that someone
might wreck the place?

810
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,160
Someone needs to
keep an eye on the place.

811
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,640
What? Do you want to defend
this place with your life?

812
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,319
I suggest you join us

813
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:07,400
so that you won't receive
any physical damage.

814
00:33:08,567 --> 00:33:09,487
I'm not afraid.

815
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:10,920
Even if I do sustain damage,

816
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:13,239
Ms Dong will cure me.

817
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,367
Fine.

818
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,760
Later, we'll have dinner

819
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,400
at 7pm. Remember to
keep an eye on the group chat.

820
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,880
Okay? 7pm.

821
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,760
Remember, it's 7pm.

822
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:42,919
Don't forget.

823
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:49,878
Isn't this adorable?

824
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:02,920
You want that?

825
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,706
I'll get it for you.

826
00:34:07,239 --> 00:34:09,479
Mister, how much does it cost?

827
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,120
Mister, I'll pay for it. Scan my code.

828
00:34:11,479 --> 00:34:12,800
Thank you, Mr Tian Zhen.

829
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,718
I'll get it for you.

830
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,879
Give me another one.

831
00:34:45,399 --> 00:34:46,329
Here I go.

832
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,760
Tou, you are terrible at this.

833
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,000
-You scared me. What?
-Give them to me.

834
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,000
-Can you do it?
-Here you go.

835
00:35:02,919 --> 00:35:03,774
He got it!

836
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,320
Not bad at all.

837
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,760
Do you even know how to play the game?

838
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:10,631
Meng Meng,

839
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,080
I'm not very good at this.

840
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,679
However, I'm great at
playing claw machines.

841
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,399
If you want a plush toy,

842
00:35:16,399 --> 00:35:17,479
I can get you

843
00:35:17,479 --> 00:35:18,639
the toy you want.

844
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:19,560
It's hard to say.

845
00:35:19,879 --> 00:35:20,879
We can do it too.

846
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,080
What are you

847
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:22,919
saying?

848
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,000
-You want to play?
-Yeah.

849
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:25,840
I'm good at this. Come.

850
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,000
It's impossible.

851
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,280
Listen, I'll get it on my first try.

852
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,560
You're just wasting your money.

853
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,600
That's impossible. Look.

854
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,600
Let me show you.

855
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,120
Senior,

856
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,560
I don't think I can do that.

857
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,040
(You own many companies
in the tertiary industry.)

858
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,879
Is it that hard for me
to get a classroom?

859
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,086
That's not the hard part.

860
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,679
The hard part is to pacify the people.

861
00:35:55,399 --> 00:35:56,879
You see, if I'm giving you
what you want now,

862
00:35:57,199 --> 00:35:58,134
what should I do

863
00:35:58,639 --> 00:35:59,639
when other people ask me
for the same thing?

864
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:01,760
If I don't give it to them,
I'll be biased.

865
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,520
(You and I are from the same sect.)

866
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:05,000
(Just one report letter)

867
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,280
(is enough to land me in trouble.)

868
00:36:06,879 --> 00:36:08,280
I thought you promised

869
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,360
Fellow Zhang

870
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,120
that your academy would help us out

871
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,479
if we were in trouble?

872
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,600
Now, the apprentice class
is in a pickle here.

873
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,760
How do you plan to resolve the issue?

874
00:36:17,721 --> 00:36:18,655
Me?

875
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,399
At most, I can hold one,

876
00:36:22,399 --> 00:36:23,256
two,

877
00:36:23,689 --> 00:36:24,689
or even three seminars for you.

878
00:36:25,159 --> 00:36:27,439
(But now, you're asking me
for a classroom.)

879
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:29,120
And, you'll be using it
for quite a few years.

880
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,560
The thing is,
you're not paying rent for it.

881
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,040
How can I explain myself
to the higher-ups?

882
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
What about this?

883
00:36:37,552 --> 00:36:39,032
For the sake of your apprentice class,

884
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,639
I'll sacrifice my career.

885
00:36:43,239 --> 00:36:44,840
I'll resign

886
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,679
(and be the class teacher)

887
00:36:46,919 --> 00:36:48,199
(for the apprentice class.)

888
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:51,760
I'll be thick-skinned and go out
to ask for donations.

889
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,520
What do you think?

890
00:36:53,665 --> 00:36:54,534
Stop your pointless chatter.

891
00:36:56,425 --> 00:36:57,275
Fine.

892
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,054
I'll think of something myself.

893
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,600
Your lot

894
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:24,879
is the best out of all.

895
00:37:25,399 --> 00:37:26,679
That's all?

896
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,879
Is this a good thing or a bad thing?

897
00:37:30,879 --> 00:37:32,600
-I didn't get it.
-Yeah. Tell us the details.

898
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,479
-Is it good or bad?
-Late bloomer.

899
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,560
How late is late?

900
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:44,439
According to how
modern people calculate age,

901
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:47,239
it'll be around 60 years old.

902
00:37:50,199 --> 00:37:51,080
60 years old?

903
00:37:51,959 --> 00:37:53,239
That's pretty good.

904
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:54,600
People always seek out

905
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,040
senior TCM practitioners.

906
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:56,870
That's not it.

907
00:37:56,959 --> 00:37:57,800
Both of my parents

908
00:37:57,919 --> 00:37:58,840
made a name for themselves

909
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,919
at a young age.

910
00:37:59,919 --> 00:38:00,840
But I'm only making a name
for myself at 60?

911
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,919
Do you think that's appropriate?

912
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,199
Yeah.

913
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:05,320
Why not? I think it's good enough
to make a name for yourself.

914
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,639
Look at me.

915
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:07,959
I'll stay like this
for the rest of my life.

916
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,040
I'm the same even when I'm 80.

917
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,159
Are you trying

918
00:38:11,577 --> 00:38:12,451
to console me?

919
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,199
I don't think so.

920
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,600
Let's check out the other stalls.

921
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,660
Alright.

922
00:38:22,984 --> 00:38:24,423
-Let's check them out.
-They're selling food.

923
00:38:24,936 --> 00:38:26,016
-Meng Meng, let's go.
-Let's go.

924
00:38:26,177 --> 00:38:27,035
Let's go.

925
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,713
Excuse me.

926
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,159
Let me ask you something.

927
00:38:38,959 --> 00:38:41,000
Are you a human or a robot?

928
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:45,120
Sir, what other questions do you have?

929
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:47,512
It's fine. Thank you.

930
00:38:52,879 --> 00:38:53,760
One of them

931
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:55,239
is a late bloomer

932
00:38:55,439 --> 00:38:56,600
while the other one is a prodigy.

933
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:08,120
What should we do now?

934
00:39:08,879 --> 00:39:09,919
I just feel apologetic

935
00:39:10,199 --> 00:39:11,719
toward Ms Dong.

936
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:14,719
You always led a reclusive life.

937
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:15,979
Now,

938
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:18,008
you're here.

939
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,439
But we don't even have a classroom
for you to teach them.

940
00:39:20,479 --> 00:39:21,959
Yeah, it's all my fault.

941
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,120
I should've expected this to happen

942
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,360
when I severed my ties

943
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,000
with them.

944
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,520
Actually, they're not obliged

945
00:39:28,792 --> 00:39:30,072
to help us out

946
00:39:30,248 --> 00:39:31,728
for free.

947
00:39:32,185 --> 00:39:33,304
Businessmen

948
00:39:33,807 --> 00:39:35,888
value profit over righteousness.

949
00:39:36,944 --> 00:39:37,944
That's a hasty generalization.

950
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,399
There are many
righteous businessmen too.

951
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:44,961
Master,

952
00:39:45,335 --> 00:39:46,936
you always told me

953
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:48,600
that if I have an idea,

954
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:49,959
everything will fall into place.

955
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:51,159
I had this idea

956
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:52,800
for a long time.

957
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,280
Why isn't anyone

958
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,840
giving me a classroom?

959
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,639
You see,

960
00:39:57,639 --> 00:39:59,000
that only works

961
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,360
when you're Buddha.

962
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,439
You still have a long way to go.

963
00:40:02,439 --> 00:40:03,320
You're right.

964
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,840
You see,

965
00:40:06,367 --> 00:40:07,768
knowledge and action
should go hand in hand.

966
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,919
From realising
the righteousness of the event

967
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:12,760
to the completion of the event,

968
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,673
everything else in between

969
00:40:13,879 --> 00:40:15,399
acts as your trial.

970
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,280
God is giving you an ordeal

971
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,280
called The Dignity Ordeal.

972
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,800
Master, you're right.

973
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,600
Master, I'll be honest with you.

974
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,439
In the past, I didn't think

975
00:40:31,159 --> 00:40:32,439
that this industry was that tough.

976
00:40:33,159 --> 00:40:34,360
But now, it's...

977
00:40:36,679 --> 00:40:37,600
Think about it.

978
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,040
Throughout your career,

979
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:41,840
you were talented

980
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,239
and you had academic qualifications.

981
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:45,088
And,

982
00:40:45,399 --> 00:40:47,000
you had elders like us

983
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,120
backing you up.

984
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,479
Of course you had a smooth journey.

985
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:51,507
You're right.

986
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:52,639
Now,

987
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,120
I'm old.

988
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,520
I'm afraid I won't be able
to back you up anymore.

989
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,280
I'm afraid you need to back me up

990
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,280
in the future.

991
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,000
Dad, such chatter is meaningless.

992
00:41:06,679 --> 00:41:08,159
Now, we need to figure out a way

993
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:09,560
to resolve this issue.

994
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,800
Yeah.

995
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,280
Ms Dong,

996
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,600
I'm truly sorry.

997
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,600
We invited you all the way here,

998
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:18,710
however,

999
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,600
we don't even have a place

1000
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,800
for you to teach them.

1001
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:22,919
That's fine.

1002
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,560
When we decide

1003
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,560
to take the righteous path,

1004
00:41:29,159 --> 00:41:30,479
we have to put in much more effort

1005
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:32,879
than taking the back door.

1006
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,919
God will test you

1007
00:41:34,919 --> 00:41:36,120
repeatedly

1008
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,120
to see

1009
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,879
whether you're truly sincere
in taking this path.

1010
00:41:42,751 --> 00:41:43,659
If you can pass God's test

1011
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:45,719
every time without changing your goal,

1012
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,159
you'll achieve what you wish for.

1013
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,760
In my opinion,

1014
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:53,159
this isn't even

1015
00:41:53,439 --> 00:41:54,879
an ordeal for you.

1016
00:41:55,879 --> 00:41:56,774
You're

1017
00:41:56,879 --> 00:41:58,159
an academician.

1018
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,679
You published books and
made a name for yourself.

1019
00:42:02,199 --> 00:42:03,439
But people like us?

1020
00:42:03,959 --> 00:42:05,000
It's quite difficult for us

1021
00:42:05,919 --> 00:42:07,800
to pass our legacy
to the next generation.

1022
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:10,520
In Taoism,

1023
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,000
masters will look for
their own disciples.

1024
00:42:12,919 --> 00:42:14,600
I agreed to join your class

1025
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,600
not because to help you out.

1026
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:18,679
I'm helping myself out.

1027
00:42:19,624 --> 00:42:20,506
I was thinking

1028
00:42:20,752 --> 00:42:21,752
that I'll encounter a disciple

1029
00:42:22,209 --> 00:42:24,368
who's a kindred spirit
if I teach enough classes.

1030
00:42:25,399 --> 00:42:26,719
Maybe that person is willing
to inherit our legacy

1031
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:30,239
without changing anything.

1032
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,813
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

1033
00:42:34,901 --> 00:42:36,416
(are referenced from relevant
traditional Chinese medicine books)
