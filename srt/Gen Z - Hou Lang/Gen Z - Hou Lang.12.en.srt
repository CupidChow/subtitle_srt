1
00:00:05,746 --> 00:00:07,432
Take everything in moderation.

2
00:00:08,281 --> 00:00:09,574
This is my reward for you.

3
00:00:09,887 --> 00:00:10,815
-Here.
-Alright.

4
00:00:10,899 --> 00:00:12,256
If so,

5
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:13,257
I'll take the entire pot.

6
00:00:13,341 --> 00:00:14,480
I don't want to share it with you.

7
00:00:19,401 --> 00:00:20,277
Just pour a little for me.

8
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,438
-Come on.
-Take everything in moderation.

9
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:22,561
You said so yourself.

10
00:00:24,321 --> 00:00:25,158
-Just a little more.
-Stop drinking.

11
00:00:25,241 --> 00:00:26,663
-Just a little more.
-Stop drinking. Have some food.

12
00:00:26,746 --> 00:00:27,597
Alright.

13
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,798
Your mouth is so oily.

14
00:00:28,881 --> 00:00:29,961
Wipe your mouth.

15
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,480
Stop drinking.

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,078
Wait. What are you doing?

17
00:00:35,161 --> 00:00:36,161
Hey.

18
00:00:36,281 --> 00:00:37,281
There's not much left.

19
00:00:37,801 --> 00:00:39,001
-Just a little.
-Just a little?

20
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,285
-Yeah.
-Just a little, okay?

21
00:00:40,721 --> 00:00:41,998
Only a little.

22
00:00:42,081 --> 00:00:44,101
That's enough.
That's too much.

23
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,441
Cheers.

24
00:00:47,801 --> 00:00:49,038
You don't understand, right?

25
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,518
Cheers is what they say in English.

26
00:00:52,441 --> 00:00:53,441
Cheers.

27
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,680
How much did you drink?

28
00:01:00,001 --> 00:01:01,281
How did you get so drunk?

29
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,001
I'll make some hangover soup for you.

30
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,880
Here.

31
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,680
Drink this.

32
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,960
Don't you know how much liquor

33
00:01:54,801 --> 00:01:55,801
you can drink?

34
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,600
I'm teaching students in accordance

35
00:01:59,361 --> 00:02:00,680
with their aptitude.

36
00:02:02,161 --> 00:02:05,320
First, I lure her in with desire.

37
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,081
After that, I'll bring her to
the righteous path.

38
00:02:12,801 --> 00:02:14,600
Tou Tou is a promising child.

39
00:02:15,801 --> 00:02:16,918
It's just that it's difficult

40
00:02:17,001 --> 00:02:18,760
to be her teacher.

41
00:02:19,361 --> 00:02:20,361
Look at me.

42
00:02:21,001 --> 00:02:22,361
I'm giving everything I got

43
00:02:23,001 --> 00:02:25,001
to realise Master's dream.

44
00:02:25,441 --> 00:02:26,998
I've never seen you put this much effort

45
00:02:27,081 --> 00:02:28,161
in teaching Tian Zhen.

46
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,079
It's because I know

47
00:02:29,162 --> 00:02:30,918
Tian Zhen

48
00:02:31,001 --> 00:02:32,400
belongs here.

49
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,721
He can't run away.

50
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:41,321
But Tou Tou?

51
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,518
She might run away

52
00:02:43,601 --> 00:02:44,800
if we take our eyes off her.

53
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,278
I think

54
00:02:46,361 --> 00:02:48,360
you're sure that I won't run away.

55
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:50,001
That's why you make
endless demands of me.

56
00:02:51,441 --> 00:02:53,120
Dear, that sounds unfair to me.

57
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,240
Unfair?

58
00:02:55,721 --> 00:02:57,001
Was I wrong?

59
00:02:59,441 --> 00:03:00,520
You put so much effort

60
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:03,117
in treating outsiders.

61
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,360
What about your family?

62
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:08,721
This is

63
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,960
a common problem among humans.

64
00:03:11,601 --> 00:03:12,601
We always show outsiders

65
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,960
our best side

66
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,920
and show our family members
our worst side.

67
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,837
Don't think

68
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,717
that I invited Tou Tou to drink with me

69
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,601
so that I could transform her.

70
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,640
I was cleaning up the mess
your son had made.

71
00:03:32,321 --> 00:03:33,360
If so, why didn't you let him

72
00:03:33,601 --> 00:03:35,001
treat the girl during the forum?

73
00:03:37,721 --> 00:03:39,321
So, you were waiting
to say that all along?

74
00:03:41,441 --> 00:03:42,597
I was wondering

75
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,918
why everything

76
00:03:44,001 --> 00:03:45,161
wasn't proceeding smoothly lately.

77
00:03:45,561 --> 00:03:47,161
Your son wasn't ready yet.

78
00:03:48,001 --> 00:03:49,520
If you don't let him give it a try,

79
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,881
he'll never be ready.

80
00:03:53,001 --> 00:03:54,001
Both you

81
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,960
and Uncle were around.

82
00:03:58,001 --> 00:04:00,358
And, he wanted to send Tian Zhen
to give the girl a diagnosis.

83
00:04:00,441 --> 00:04:02,721
He wanted to see how capable
Tian Zhen was.

84
00:04:03,001 --> 00:04:05,561
You only look on the bright side.

85
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,721
What if your son

86
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,080
made things worse?

87
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,800
If Tou Tou made things worse,

88
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,360
everyone could at least
come to terms with it.

89
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,881
I could back her up.

90
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:17,881
But if I send your son there

91
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,360
and back him up,

92
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,597
the Song family

93
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,960
will be embarrassed.

94
00:04:24,721 --> 00:04:26,360
I didn't send your son there

95
00:04:26,721 --> 00:04:29,001
in order to protect him.

96
00:04:29,841 --> 00:04:30,841
Goodness.

97
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,649
This concerns the girl's life, you know?

98
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,400
Listen.

99
00:04:36,161 --> 00:04:38,360
I'll tell you this.

100
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,721
Although Tou Tou is boorish,

101
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:43,400
she's talented.

102
00:04:43,881 --> 00:04:45,358
She's talented

103
00:04:45,441 --> 00:04:47,441
and she's meant to take this path.

104
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,638
She might be distracted

105
00:04:49,721 --> 00:04:51,680
during our lessons,

106
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,918
however, she has a delicate heart.

107
00:04:55,001 --> 00:04:57,041
Her eyes and ears were open
and receptive.

108
00:04:58,441 --> 00:04:59,478
She remembered everything

109
00:04:59,561 --> 00:05:01,321
I said and taught.

110
00:05:01,561 --> 00:05:02,960
Not only did she observe what I taught,

111
00:05:04,001 --> 00:05:05,001
but she could also apply them.

112
00:05:05,561 --> 00:05:06,678
She observed that Mr Zheng's daughter

113
00:05:06,761 --> 00:05:08,561
had eczema.

114
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,120
When your son was there,

115
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:11,561
he only said

116
00:05:11,841 --> 00:05:12,841
that she had a fever.

117
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,037
He may be able to cure her fever,

118
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,680
but he'll never think of

119
00:05:16,881 --> 00:05:18,678
making egg yolk oil on the scene

120
00:05:18,761 --> 00:05:19,761
and letting the girl apply it.

121
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,800
Do you think he'll think of that?

122
00:05:22,161 --> 00:05:23,441
He'll never think of that.

123
00:05:24,281 --> 00:05:25,798
The people there might have

124
00:05:25,881 --> 00:05:27,717
a doctorate or a Master's degree,

125
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,639
but none of them

126
00:05:28,722 --> 00:05:30,800
can do any better than Tou Tou.

127
00:05:32,841 --> 00:05:33,759
You're excited and proud

128
00:05:33,842 --> 00:05:35,240
when you talk about Sun Tou Tou.

129
00:05:38,321 --> 00:05:39,321
You feel like throwing up again?

130
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:42,841
I'll go to the toilet.

131
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,120
Li Quan applied for leave again?

132
00:05:54,281 --> 00:05:56,317
Yes, this is already the second time
this month.

133
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,157
And, he applied for leave once

134
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,240
during our weekend lesson.

135
00:05:59,841 --> 00:06:00,841
Tian Zhen,

136
00:06:01,721 --> 00:06:03,001
did you know that Li Quan
applied for leave?

137
00:06:03,561 --> 00:06:04,561
I know that.

138
00:06:05,881 --> 00:06:06,881
Where did he go?

139
00:06:07,281 --> 00:06:08,281
He...

140
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,800
He's doing a part-time job.

141
00:06:10,841 --> 00:06:11,841
A part-time job?

142
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,400
What does that mean?

143
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,974
He's doing foot massages.

144
00:06:18,057 --> 00:06:19,037
Dr Song,

145
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,317
someone left their belongings
in the storeroom.

146
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,400
Come and take a look.

147
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,800
Call Zhao Li Quan.

148
00:06:31,441 --> 00:06:32,441
Tell him to pack his belongings.

149
00:06:33,441 --> 00:06:34,881
How could he keep them here?

150
00:06:36,841 --> 00:06:38,120
This is a medical centre, not a hotel.

151
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,601
The medicine we use
will be consumed by the patients.

152
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,037
Where will he stay then?

153
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:46,918
Take his things out.

154
00:06:47,001 --> 00:06:48,001
How is that my business?

155
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,120
Tian Zhen,

156
00:06:52,441 --> 00:06:54,321
is Li Quan facing any difficulties?

157
00:06:55,321 --> 00:06:57,960
I lent him my dorm last time.

158
00:06:58,161 --> 00:06:59,437
But the dorm had tight security.

159
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,357
I told him to stay here
for the time being.

160
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,078
I think he's going to rent a unit soon.

161
00:07:03,161 --> 00:07:03,918
That's why he applied for leave

162
00:07:04,001 --> 00:07:05,841
in order to work outside.

163
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,797
He should find a job

164
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,960
with stable income.

165
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:12,000
He can come and learn

166
00:07:12,161 --> 00:07:13,161
when he has time.

167
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,241
If so, you can just give him a job.

168
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,440
Just make him a pharmaceutical worker.

169
00:07:18,681 --> 00:07:20,121
He can prepare prescriptions.

170
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,718
He can study at the same time.

171
00:07:21,801 --> 00:07:22,758
And, he'll make some money too.

172
00:07:22,841 --> 00:07:23,841
Isn't that the best of both worlds?

173
00:07:25,601 --> 00:07:28,041
Zhao Li Quan will be
a doctor in the future.

174
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,357
He can't just steal other people's jobs.

175
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,440
Go and ask him.

176
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,560
It's either he continues his study

177
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
or works outside.

178
00:07:37,801 --> 00:07:39,560
You're discriminating against him here.

179
00:07:40,161 --> 00:07:42,117
Why can Peng Shi Yan work
while studying then?

180
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,361
Why can't Zhao Li Quan do the same?

181
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,198
Peng Shi Yan

182
00:07:46,281 --> 00:07:48,681
doesn't make a living
as a TCM practitioner.

183
00:07:49,121 --> 00:07:51,281
TCM is Zhao Li Quan's livelihood.

184
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,598
He needs medical skills

185
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:54,560
to make a living, understood?

186
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,481
I think Tian Zhen's suggestion

187
00:07:58,681 --> 00:08:00,117
is worth considering.

188
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,801
It might work.

189
00:08:02,481 --> 00:08:03,601
If Li Quan is around,

190
00:08:04,241 --> 00:08:05,237
at least he can help us out

191
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,721
when we're busy preparing prescriptions.

192
00:08:08,241 --> 00:08:09,681
He's familiar with herbs and medicine.

193
00:08:10,121 --> 00:08:11,440
And, he was professionally trained
in this field.

194
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,477
He can prepare prescriptions

195
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,640
when we give diagnoses.

196
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,520
He can study with the other classmates

197
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,760
when there's a class.

198
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,440
This is our place after all.

199
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,237
We can pay him according to
a part-timer's rate.

200
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,320
What do you think?

201
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,477
Niece-in-law already said so much.

202
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,318
Nephew,

203
00:08:27,401 --> 00:08:29,200
why don't you consider it?

204
00:08:31,241 --> 00:08:32,760
Why are you calling me Nephew again?

205
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,440
Because it's time for me
to show my authority as your senior.

206
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,281
I know you guys are
doing this for his sake.

207
00:08:47,121 --> 00:08:49,278
But the thing is,

208
00:08:49,361 --> 00:08:50,400
Zhao Li Quan

209
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,917
must understand what he truly desires.

210
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,440
That's the main thing.

211
00:08:54,657 --> 00:08:55,657
That's it for now.

212
00:08:57,481 --> 00:08:58,481
Call him.

213
00:08:59,241 --> 00:09:00,241
He can't stay here.

214
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,357
So, does that mean

215
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,440
your father has agreed to it?

216
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,361
Your seniority does work wonders.

217
00:09:23,801 --> 00:09:24,639
You've been applying for leave

218
00:09:24,722 --> 00:09:25,880
just to work here?

219
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,200
Quit the job.

220
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,317
You're a postgraduate student
from a decent medical academy.

221
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,560
Why are you working
in a massage parlour?

222
00:09:33,921 --> 00:09:35,117
I'll get you a decent job.

223
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,200
-Come with me.
-Tian Zhen.

224
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,640
Thank you.

225
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,718
You always helped me out.

226
00:09:42,801 --> 00:09:44,000
I feel pretty bad about it.

227
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,357
I appreciate your kindness,

228
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,237
but I'm doing great here.

229
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,320
Doing great?

230
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,238
You apply for leave during the day.

231
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:49,640
You don't even attend
our lessons on the weekend.

232
00:09:49,921 --> 00:09:51,801
My father was unhappy that
you applied for leave today.

233
00:09:52,121 --> 00:09:52,918
Besides, if you work at night,

234
00:09:53,001 --> 00:09:54,841
you won't have the energy to
attend class on the second day.

235
00:09:55,121 --> 00:09:56,598
If there's a situation in your family,

236
00:09:56,681 --> 00:09:57,557
-you can tell me.
-Tian Zhen.

237
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,640
I can help you out.

238
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,320
I know you're doing it for my sake.

239
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,921
But it's not like I can accept your help

240
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,241
every time without any pressure.

241
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,241
I'm a man too. I have my dignity.

242
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,638
You said this yourself.

243
00:10:17,721 --> 00:10:19,237
You said you would find a mentor
in the apprentice class

244
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,557
and ask them to take you
under their wing.

245
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,718
How could you learn from them

246
00:10:21,801 --> 00:10:22,801
when you're doing this?

247
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,718
I do want to get a mentor

248
00:10:25,801 --> 00:10:27,000
and learn under them.

249
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,320
However, I need to survive first.

250
00:10:31,361 --> 00:10:32,361
You saw this yourself.

251
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,361
I've always been working outside.

252
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,477
It was different when I was in college.

253
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,398
Back then, I was just
providing for myself.

254
00:10:37,481 --> 00:10:38,398
I didn't need to provide for my family.

255
00:10:38,481 --> 00:10:39,199
Now, it's different.

256
00:10:39,282 --> 00:10:40,880
Now, I have to make money
and provide for my family.

257
00:10:42,921 --> 00:10:44,198
Forget it. Let's drop the topic.

258
00:10:44,281 --> 00:10:45,281
You won't understand anyway.

259
00:10:46,481 --> 00:10:48,357
Your starting point is the endpoint
I've been trying to achieve.

260
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,598
Wait. What did you say?

261
00:10:49,681 --> 00:10:51,121
-Wait.
-This is...

262
00:10:51,241 --> 00:10:53,241
What are you guys saying?

263
00:10:54,361 --> 00:10:55,598
You guys are going off-topic here.

264
00:10:55,681 --> 00:10:56,960
It's way off-topic.

265
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,880
Is it that complicated?

266
00:11:01,241 --> 00:11:02,520
Do you wish to find

267
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,038
a way for you to study

268
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:05,681
and make money at the same time?

269
00:11:05,921 --> 00:11:07,241
Right now, there's such a deal.

270
00:11:07,841 --> 00:11:09,440
It can satisfy your need to study

271
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,158
and help you make money too.
Do you want it or not?

272
00:11:11,241 --> 00:11:12,241
Why are you here?

273
00:11:12,361 --> 00:11:13,560
Why the heck are you here?

274
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,078
Didn't you come here

275
00:11:15,161 --> 00:11:16,477
to help your friend?

276
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,398
You already arranged
something for him, right?

277
00:11:18,481 --> 00:11:20,198
Just tell him.

278
00:11:20,281 --> 00:11:21,237
Tell him everything.

279
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,079
Tell him both the pros and cons.

280
00:11:22,162 --> 00:11:23,797
Let him make the call.

281
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,718
He's the one making the call here,
not you.

282
00:11:25,801 --> 00:11:28,080
Why are you acting like
you're his father?

283
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,917
But you!

284
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,917
You kept interrupting him

285
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,878
when he was trying

286
00:11:31,961 --> 00:11:33,320
to tell you about it.

287
00:11:33,481 --> 00:11:34,997
I was so fed up.

288
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,477
Can't you just wait for him
to finish his words

289
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,921
before you interrupt?

290
00:11:43,241 --> 00:11:44,241
Just cut to the chase.

291
00:11:44,801 --> 00:11:45,880
Don't talk about anything else.

292
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,281
You can work as a pharmaceutical worker
in my family's medical centre.

293
00:11:49,801 --> 00:11:51,161
You can attend class when there's one.

294
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,760
My father has already agreed to it.

295
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,440
Thank you.

296
00:11:59,121 --> 00:12:00,121
Thank you.

297
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,880
Don't mention it.

298
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,320
Yeah.

299
00:12:04,681 --> 00:12:05,801
Here you go.

300
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,640
Isn't it simple?

301
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,078
You guys would've argued

302
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:11,721
for three hours if I weren't here.

303
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,320
Quan,

304
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,244
you might not be able to
live in the medical centre anymore.

305
00:12:15,408 --> 00:12:16,158
That's fine.

306
00:12:16,241 --> 00:12:17,838
I'll get my wage soon.

307
00:12:17,921 --> 00:12:19,481
I'll stay in a cheap place
for the time being.

308
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,880
Okay.

309
00:12:30,801 --> 00:12:31,801
Fools.

310
00:13:25,121 --> 00:13:26,121
Xing Xing.

311
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,880
We meet again.

312
00:13:28,681 --> 00:13:29,477
Dear,

313
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,560
you're here to pick me up?

314
00:13:32,361 --> 00:13:33,361
Someone's following me.

315
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,080
Is he gone?

316
00:13:47,681 --> 00:13:48,681
He should be gone.

317
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,640
That was terrifying.

318
00:13:54,121 --> 00:13:56,038
That guy followed me
all the way here from the subway.

319
00:13:56,121 --> 00:13:57,320
He kept staring at me.

320
00:13:57,681 --> 00:13:58,917
Listen. Next time, if you encounter
someone like him,

321
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,200
just stare at him.

322
00:14:00,801 --> 00:14:02,041
People like him are timid.

323
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,358
I'm not Tou Tou.

324
00:14:03,441 --> 00:14:04,921
I dare not stare at him.

325
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,320
What are you doing here?

326
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,320
I...

327
00:14:16,801 --> 00:14:17,801
You must make sure
your centre of gravity

328
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,921
is between your legs.

329
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,560
Wait.

330
00:14:21,923 --> 00:14:23,361
Wait.

331
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,320
Who's calling you?

332
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,320
It's Xing Xing.

333
00:14:33,121 --> 00:14:34,121
Hello?

334
00:14:34,801 --> 00:14:36,801
Sun Tou Tou, what have you done?

335
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,041
What do you mean
by sending a guy to my house?

336
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:40,918
Xing Xing,

337
00:14:41,001 --> 00:14:43,000
it's pretty late now.

338
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,237
Have you taken dinner?

339
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,281
Did you work overtime again?

340
00:14:47,681 --> 00:14:49,078
I'm sure it's tough on you.

341
00:14:49,161 --> 00:14:50,560
I'm heartbroken.

342
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,080
Don't interrupt me.

343
00:14:52,321 --> 00:14:53,237
Tell me.

344
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,477
You sent a man to my house.

345
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,518
What should I do?

346
00:14:55,601 --> 00:14:56,997
(Xing Xing, listen.)

347
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,237
Quan is so pitiful.

348
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,917
Not only can he not afford food,

349
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,917
but he also
can't afford a place to stay.

350
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,917
(My bed is vacant anyway.)

351
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,198
(That's why I sent him there.)

352
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:08,718
(Can you take pity on him)

353
00:15:08,801 --> 00:15:09,838
and take him in?

354
00:15:09,921 --> 00:15:10,839
I promise.

355
00:15:10,922 --> 00:15:12,317
He's a good guy.

356
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,681
He won't cross the line.

357
00:15:14,921 --> 00:15:16,158
I don't know if he's a good guy or not,

358
00:15:16,241 --> 00:15:18,361
but he's a guy.

359
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,400
(That's even better.)

360
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,080
I thought it was dangerous for you
to live alone.

361
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,640
Now, there's a guy to protect you.

362
00:15:24,724 --> 00:15:26,164
I can rest at ease now.

363
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,280
(And, Xing Xing, think about it.)

364
00:15:33,481 --> 00:15:34,399
(He knows how to give massages.)

365
00:15:34,482 --> 00:15:35,798
If you have issues like a stiff neck,

366
00:15:35,881 --> 00:15:37,680
you don't even need to
go to the massage parlour.

367
00:15:37,881 --> 00:15:38,759
Just stay at home.

368
00:15:38,842 --> 00:15:41,318
First come, first served, right?

369
00:15:41,401 --> 00:15:43,241
(Isn't it convenient?)

370
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,121
You'll land me in trouble eventually.

371
00:15:57,761 --> 00:15:58,761
What? You expect me
to carry your luggage?

372
00:16:11,881 --> 00:16:12,881
Slowly.

373
00:16:13,001 --> 00:16:13,798
You must be careful when you go up.

374
00:16:13,881 --> 00:16:15,121
-Come on.
-Let's continue.

375
00:16:15,721 --> 00:16:16,721
Maintain your centre of gravity.

376
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,200
Okay.

377
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,761
Feel the harmony between man and nature.

378
00:16:32,121 --> 00:16:33,121
Say,

379
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,798
is chiropractic

380
00:16:34,881 --> 00:16:35,679
the thing

381
00:16:35,762 --> 00:16:37,680
where they pop the bones?

382
00:16:38,361 --> 00:16:39,361
That's not it.

383
00:16:39,841 --> 00:16:41,280
Ms Dong doesn't do that.

384
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,997
It's dangerous when
you crack bones like that.

385
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,438
No, that's not what I mean.

386
00:16:44,521 --> 00:16:45,398
I mean popping the bones.

387
00:16:45,481 --> 00:16:46,358
There's a sound to it.

388
00:16:46,441 --> 00:16:48,278
What's the difference between them?

389
00:16:48,361 --> 00:16:49,678
Cracking

390
00:16:49,761 --> 00:16:50,639
makes a different sound.

391
00:16:50,722 --> 00:16:51,758
Popping makes a different sound.

392
00:16:51,841 --> 00:16:52,758
That's the difference.

393
00:16:52,841 --> 00:16:53,877
It's the same thing.

394
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,401
How could they be the same?

395
00:16:56,001 --> 00:16:57,237
The difference is

396
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,997
that chiropractic is fake.

397
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,601
It's a lie.

398
00:17:01,361 --> 00:17:02,440
It's already good enough

399
00:17:02,641 --> 00:17:05,121
for massages and the likes
to help our bodies to relax.

400
00:17:05,241 --> 00:17:06,601
We mustn't abuse

401
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,680
the power of rumours.

402
00:17:09,001 --> 00:17:10,521
It'll harm the people.

403
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,638
That's why I think

404
00:17:11,721 --> 00:17:13,038
TCM practitioners
can focus on healthcare

405
00:17:13,121 --> 00:17:14,521
while doctors can focus on treatments.

406
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,478
We should stay on our designated trails.

407
00:17:15,561 --> 00:17:16,721
Isn't that better?

408
00:17:17,241 --> 00:17:18,197
I don't know about the others,

409
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,877
but Ms Dong is a living deity.

410
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,121
If she does work her magic,

411
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,200
you'll feel like you've been reborn.

412
00:17:23,721 --> 00:17:25,197
I know her for many years.

413
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,118
I saw for myself

414
00:17:26,201 --> 00:17:27,278
that patients in wheelchairs

415
00:17:27,361 --> 00:17:29,001
could walk out of the room
after her treatment.

416
00:17:29,241 --> 00:17:30,320
Guys, listen to him.

417
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,398
She used her hand
to restore the position of the bones,

418
00:17:32,481 --> 00:17:34,960
and that could achieve
the effect of surgeries.

419
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,641
Don't you think it's ridiculous?

420
00:17:36,881 --> 00:17:38,237
Even doctors can't guarantee

421
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,160
that a cripple could walk out of
the room after surgery.

422
00:17:41,481 --> 00:17:42,318
Pick it up.

423
00:17:42,401 --> 00:17:44,001
Look. He's resorting to this
when he can't win the argument.

424
00:17:59,841 --> 00:18:01,038
You deserved it.

425
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:02,197
Shi Yan, you'd better believe it.

426
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,237
There's an old lady called Luo You Ming
in Shuangqiao, Beijing.

427
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,638
She could set bones

428
00:18:05,721 --> 00:18:06,721
with just her hands.

429
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,200
Premier Zhou even
built a hospital for her.

430
00:18:09,401 --> 00:18:10,319
She could

431
00:18:10,402 --> 00:18:13,429
set fractures, even crushed bones

432
00:18:13,512 --> 00:18:14,512
and restore them.

433
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,117
Is that Ms Dong

434
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,158
as good as the old lady
in Shuangqiao, Beijing?

435
00:18:18,241 --> 00:18:20,121
If that's the case, she's even better
than my nephew then.

436
00:18:20,721 --> 00:18:21,721
Yeah.

437
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,001
Is Mr Ren here?

438
00:18:28,521 --> 00:18:29,638
This must be the classroom.

439
00:18:29,721 --> 00:18:30,761
That's Zhu's car.

440
00:18:31,721 --> 00:18:32,721
He's here?

441
00:18:35,841 --> 00:18:37,320
Mr Ren!

442
00:18:38,721 --> 00:18:40,190
I finally found you!

443
00:18:40,273 --> 00:18:41,273
Mr Zhu,

444
00:18:41,361 --> 00:18:43,881
I thought we had an appointment
in the medical centre on Monday?

445
00:18:44,479 --> 00:18:46,396
I couldn't sleep well
for the past few days.

446
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,514
(Zhu Chang Ming) I was
flustered. I couldn't wait any longer.

447
00:18:48,641 --> 00:18:50,241
Mr Ren, please read my pulse.

448
00:18:51,226 --> 00:18:52,226
(Dong Hui Ci)
Check my pulse.

449
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,400
Yeah.

450
00:18:53,481 --> 00:18:56,518
I just received a batch of
top-quality cordyceps.

451
00:18:56,601 --> 00:18:58,241
There are only 1,000 of them in one jin.

452
00:18:58,521 --> 00:18:59,521
I bought 500,000 yuan
worth of cordyceps.

453
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:00,960
Should I consume it?

454
00:19:01,121 --> 00:19:02,798
Or should I

455
00:19:02,881 --> 00:19:04,398
consume the 60-years-old
wild ginseng I have?

456
00:19:04,481 --> 00:19:05,481
What do you think?

457
00:19:05,939 --> 00:19:06,939
What about this?

458
00:19:07,121 --> 00:19:08,638
You can tell us

459
00:19:08,721 --> 00:19:10,038
the "tonics"

460
00:19:10,121 --> 00:19:12,278
you think that are good for you

461
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:13,721
lately.

462
00:19:13,881 --> 00:19:14,881
I took plenty of them.

463
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,639
Turtles,
ginseng,

464
00:19:17,722 --> 00:19:18,717
dendrobium, sea cucumbers,

465
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,639
I took everything.

466
00:19:19,722 --> 00:19:21,881
So, do you feel better
after taking them?

467
00:19:22,241 --> 00:19:24,080
Or do you feel uncomfortable?

468
00:19:24,721 --> 00:19:25,758
It's like this.

469
00:19:25,841 --> 00:19:27,558
I think it's only worth it

470
00:19:27,641 --> 00:19:29,117
if I take such expensive tonics.

471
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,798
I make a lot of money.

472
00:19:30,881 --> 00:19:31,881
What else should I spend them on
besides food?

473
00:19:32,641 --> 00:19:33,881
So, you have too much money, huh?

474
00:19:34,401 --> 00:19:35,721
You should do charity with them then.

475
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,121
You can donate to our apprentice class.

476
00:19:38,841 --> 00:19:40,320
Mr Ren, it's like this.

477
00:19:40,481 --> 00:19:42,318
I can't donate my money when I'm alive.

478
00:19:42,401 --> 00:19:43,198
I'll donate everything to you

479
00:19:43,281 --> 00:19:44,798
once I'm dead.

480
00:19:44,881 --> 00:19:46,158
Donating my money

481
00:19:46,241 --> 00:19:47,721
is just like donating my organs.

482
00:19:48,001 --> 00:19:49,241
I'll feel terrible.

483
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,678
Zhu, you need to understand this.

484
00:19:51,761 --> 00:19:52,841
Herbs and tonics are used

485
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,241
to rectify a deviation.

486
00:19:56,121 --> 00:19:58,158
Not all tonics can be consumed.

487
00:19:58,241 --> 00:20:00,038
Judging from your current condition,

488
00:20:00,121 --> 00:20:01,320
it's useless

489
00:20:01,521 --> 00:20:02,521
to take any kind of tonics.

490
00:20:02,721 --> 00:20:04,158
Even so, I have to take something.

491
00:20:04,241 --> 00:20:06,237
Give me a prescription.
Give me a prescription.

492
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,320
You?

493
00:20:07,601 --> 00:20:08,641
Listen.

494
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,398
Carrot and Chinese cabbages
are your best bet.

495
00:20:11,481 --> 00:20:12,877
Seasonal and cheap ingredients

496
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,398
are best for you.

497
00:20:14,481 --> 00:20:15,601
Just adjust your diet.

498
00:20:16,121 --> 00:20:17,721
Take your meal on time
and sleep on time.

499
00:20:18,361 --> 00:20:19,518
I can't sleep.

500
00:20:19,601 --> 00:20:22,241
I wouldn't need to be here
if I could sleep in the first place.

501
00:20:22,601 --> 00:20:23,601
What do you think?

502
00:20:25,761 --> 00:20:27,080
Did you owe people money lately?

503
00:20:27,386 --> 00:20:28,386
No.

504
00:20:28,521 --> 00:20:29,521
Did someone owe you money?

505
00:20:30,601 --> 00:20:31,601
Are you afraid that
you can't get it back?

506
00:20:36,147 --> 00:20:37,238
I can't treat that.

507
00:20:37,321 --> 00:20:38,278
Don't say that.

508
00:20:38,361 --> 00:20:40,278
Mr Ren, you have to
do something about me.

509
00:20:40,361 --> 00:20:41,361
You have to think of something.

510
00:20:44,241 --> 00:20:46,001
You can't just ignore me.

511
00:20:46,121 --> 00:20:46,918
What should I do then?

512
00:20:47,001 --> 00:20:48,001
Give me a prescription.

513
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,200
Have you done some movements

514
00:20:51,001 --> 00:20:53,121
that rotate your spine?

515
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,841
What do you mean?

516
00:20:56,361 --> 00:20:57,481
He plays golf.

517
00:20:59,361 --> 00:21:01,200
Did you play golf for the past few days?

518
00:21:01,841 --> 00:21:03,678
I play golf twice per week.

519
00:21:03,761 --> 00:21:04,918
I stopped playing golf after last week

520
00:21:05,001 --> 00:21:05,997
as I couldn't sleep.

521
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,080
I didn't play golf this week.

522
00:21:07,881 --> 00:21:08,877
Do you know something?

523
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,481
When you play golf,

524
00:21:10,721 --> 00:21:12,157
you're rotating your spine

525
00:21:12,241 --> 00:21:13,721
with this movement.

526
00:21:14,241 --> 00:21:15,159
This movement

527
00:21:15,242 --> 00:21:17,837
caused your thoracic vertebra
to shift to the wrong position.

528
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,001
And that has affected the function
of your lungs and heart.

529
00:21:20,121 --> 00:21:22,080
That's why you couldn't sleep.

530
00:21:22,241 --> 00:21:23,960
I'll restore them

531
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,200
to their original positions later.

532
00:21:25,641 --> 00:21:27,121
You'll be able to sleep well tonight
after that.

533
00:21:35,721 --> 00:21:37,440
You should give me a prescription.

534
00:21:38,761 --> 00:21:40,680
If Ms Dong said she could treat you,

535
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,881
she could definitely treat you.

536
00:21:47,241 --> 00:21:48,361
Are you sure?

537
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:51,601
Guys,

538
00:21:52,481 --> 00:21:54,477
for our chiropractic class,

539
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,398
I've invited Ms Dong Hui Ci,

540
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,001
whom I respect a lot.

541
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,721
She bumped into

542
00:22:00,001 --> 00:22:01,278
a patient at the entrance.

543
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:03,361
She's treating him right now.

544
00:22:03,601 --> 00:22:04,678
That's why

545
00:22:04,761 --> 00:22:06,040
I'm doing the introduction.

546
00:22:07,881 --> 00:22:09,560
Ms Dong is here. Let's welcome her.

547
00:22:12,241 --> 00:22:13,241
Ms Dong,

548
00:22:13,361 --> 00:22:14,438
how's the patient?

549
00:22:14,521 --> 00:22:15,518
He's asleep.

550
00:22:15,601 --> 00:22:17,560
Professor Song is looking after him.

551
00:22:18,601 --> 00:22:19,601
Guys,

552
00:22:19,881 --> 00:22:20,881
for today's class,

553
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,841
it'll definitely be interesting and fun.

554
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,601
We'll show you guys

555
00:22:27,001 --> 00:22:28,638
that not only can chiropractic
treat illness,

556
00:22:28,721 --> 00:22:30,560
but it can also treat major illnesses.

557
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:32,837
Just now, that patient said

558
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,721
he had insomnia.

559
00:22:35,641 --> 00:22:37,241
After Ms Dong's treatment,

560
00:22:37,601 --> 00:22:39,121
he's already

561
00:22:39,481 --> 00:22:41,040
fallen asleep.

562
00:22:41,881 --> 00:22:42,798
Okay.

563
00:22:42,881 --> 00:22:43,877
I'll leave this class

564
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,481
to Ms Dong.

565
00:22:46,121 --> 00:22:47,278
Ms Dong, I'll go and check on him.

566
00:22:47,361 --> 00:22:48,278
Please go ahead.

567
00:22:48,361 --> 00:22:49,117
Okay.

568
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,117
I always think that TCM practitioners
are mystifying things.

569
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,200
Say, was that Mr Zhu acting just now?

570
00:22:54,721 --> 00:22:56,001
I assume you think

571
00:22:56,121 --> 00:22:58,601
that I requested Professor Ren
to stage an act

572
00:22:58,721 --> 00:23:01,481
to show off the skills of my sect.

573
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:03,560
That's not it. Actually,

574
00:23:03,761 --> 00:23:05,080
with our skills,

575
00:23:05,241 --> 00:23:07,481
we can cure many illnesses.

576
00:23:09,001 --> 00:23:10,558
Ms Dong, not only
do you know chiropractic,

577
00:23:10,641 --> 00:23:11,881
but you can also read lips.

578
00:23:15,721 --> 00:23:16,721
Hello, everyone.

579
00:23:18,361 --> 00:23:20,320
In our daily lives,

580
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,241
we'll often encounter situations

581
00:23:22,481 --> 00:23:23,481
such as

582
00:23:23,881 --> 00:23:25,080
moving a flower pot,

583
00:23:25,601 --> 00:23:26,680
carrying a baby,

584
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,001
wearing your pants with one leg,

585
00:23:29,121 --> 00:23:31,477
or realising that you couldn't move

586
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,881
after waking up

587
00:23:33,218 --> 00:23:34,218
from a nap.

588
00:23:35,361 --> 00:23:38,521
That's what we call a twisted waist.

589
00:23:39,241 --> 00:23:40,638
There are often patients

590
00:23:40,721 --> 00:23:44,001
who experience stuffy chests,

591
00:23:44,241 --> 00:23:46,278
dizziness,

592
00:23:46,361 --> 00:23:47,800
or bedridden due to leg pain

593
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,361
due to misalignment of the spine.

594
00:23:50,481 --> 00:23:51,481
As the saying goes,

595
00:23:51,761 --> 00:23:53,560
it takes a hundred days for the bone
to knit and tendons to heal.

596
00:23:53,721 --> 00:23:56,678
Some people might look like
they've recovered

597
00:23:56,761 --> 00:23:58,721
after lying down for some time.

598
00:23:59,241 --> 00:24:00,401
But in reality,

599
00:24:00,521 --> 00:24:01,960
it became the root of other illnesses.

600
00:24:03,841 --> 00:24:05,918
Ever since smartphones

601
00:24:06,001 --> 00:24:07,601
and laptops

602
00:24:08,521 --> 00:24:10,638
became essential parts of our lives,

603
00:24:10,721 --> 00:24:12,477
even as an extension

604
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,121
of our organs,

605
00:24:14,521 --> 00:24:16,080
I could conclude

606
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,320
that spondylosis

607
00:24:17,521 --> 00:24:19,841
would be a common occurrence

608
00:24:20,481 --> 00:24:23,560
in the future.

609
00:24:25,641 --> 00:24:26,761
However, such illness

610
00:24:26,881 --> 00:24:27,918
can be treated easily

611
00:24:28,001 --> 00:24:29,200
with our methods.

612
00:24:29,881 --> 00:24:32,877
As long as you give us enough time,

613
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,518
I can restore your spines

614
00:24:34,601 --> 00:24:38,001
to their factory setting.

615
00:24:41,601 --> 00:24:43,800
Ms Dong, you should sit down
and teach us.

616
00:24:45,001 --> 00:24:46,001
Thank you.

617
00:24:46,601 --> 00:24:50,080
However, chairs with wheels
underneath them

618
00:24:50,401 --> 00:24:51,401
shouldn't be used.

619
00:24:52,121 --> 00:24:53,237
Chairs like these

620
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,521
are one of the main reasons

621
00:24:55,721 --> 00:24:57,438
of waist and

622
00:24:57,521 --> 00:24:59,200
and spinal issues.

623
00:25:00,601 --> 00:25:03,121
Chinese characters are very meaningful.

624
00:25:03,601 --> 00:25:04,761
I wish to talk about the character

625
00:25:05,401 --> 00:25:06,601
"Zuo".

626
00:25:07,601 --> 00:25:08,398
Tian Zhen,

627
00:25:08,481 --> 00:25:09,918
can you come here

628
00:25:10,001 --> 00:25:10,918
and write it down?

629
00:25:11,001 --> 00:25:12,001
Okay.

630
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,880
Look.

631
00:25:23,961 --> 00:25:25,361
The character "Zuo"

632
00:25:25,641 --> 00:25:28,560
has two people
sitting on top of the earth.

633
00:25:29,121 --> 00:25:31,237
Why are there two people?

634
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,001
To balance things out.

635
00:25:34,721 --> 00:25:36,237
Why must it be on top of the earth?

636
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,877
Because it needs to be sturdy.

637
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,601
For chairs with wheels like these,

638
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,518
we need to use the strength

639
00:25:43,601 --> 00:25:46,077
of our waist

640
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,641
to prevent it from moving.

641
00:25:50,521 --> 00:25:53,160
But when we sit on it

642
00:25:53,401 --> 00:25:55,278
and wish to move from here

643
00:25:55,361 --> 00:25:57,241
to there,

644
00:25:57,401 --> 00:25:58,401
it requires us

645
00:25:58,721 --> 00:26:01,038
to have strong core strength.

646
00:26:01,121 --> 00:26:02,518
What if you don't have

647
00:26:02,601 --> 00:26:03,957
strong core strength?

648
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,361
What will you use then?

649
00:26:06,601 --> 00:26:07,918
You'll use this part.

650
00:26:08,001 --> 00:26:09,997
This is what we refer

651
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,278
to as lumbar rotation.

652
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:12,278
It's this part.

653
00:26:12,361 --> 00:26:14,320
This will cause

654
00:26:14,641 --> 00:26:15,721
the spine to be misaligned easily.

655
00:26:17,001 --> 00:26:19,638
So, for my sake,

656
00:26:19,721 --> 00:26:20,881
I think it's better

657
00:26:21,401 --> 00:26:22,721
to teach you guys while standing.

658
00:26:26,841 --> 00:26:28,320
So, who has

659
00:26:28,481 --> 00:26:29,521
waist issues

660
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,121
among you all?

661
00:26:33,401 --> 00:26:34,401
All of you?

662
00:26:35,361 --> 00:26:36,641
Ms Dong, me.

663
00:26:39,361 --> 00:26:40,361
Okay.

664
00:26:40,721 --> 00:26:41,721
Tell me then.

665
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,320
Over here?

666
00:26:43,761 --> 00:26:45,521
Why are all these things still here?

667
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,080
Who are you? What do you need?

668
00:26:48,241 --> 00:26:49,318
We'll be renovating the place soon.

669
00:26:49,401 --> 00:26:50,881
We're here to take measurements.

670
00:26:51,121 --> 00:26:52,200
What measurements?

671
00:26:52,841 --> 00:26:53,639
I'm not talking to you.

672
00:26:53,722 --> 00:26:54,837
Take me the person in charge.

673
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,920
Wait.

674
00:26:56,641 --> 00:26:57,398
Person in charge? That's me.

675
00:26:57,481 --> 00:26:58,481
Let me see.

676
00:27:01,761 --> 00:27:02,997
What is this?

677
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,320
I'm the person in charge here.

678
00:27:04,481 --> 00:27:05,518
Hello. It's like this.

679
00:27:05,601 --> 00:27:07,038
Mr Liu told us

680
00:27:07,121 --> 00:27:08,440
to renovate the place.

681
00:27:08,721 --> 00:27:10,001
-Renovate the place?
-That's right.

682
00:27:10,121 --> 00:27:11,121
I even brought the contract here.

683
00:27:11,641 --> 00:27:12,641
Please take a look.

684
00:27:14,121 --> 00:27:15,121
What about this?

685
00:27:15,361 --> 00:27:16,357
Please wait here for a moment.

686
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,678
I'll call Mr Liu.

687
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:18,800
Okay.

688
00:27:21,241 --> 00:27:22,241
Let's go and take a look.

689
00:27:22,833 --> 00:27:24,110
Wait here.

690
00:27:24,241 --> 00:27:25,481
Take a break for now.

691
00:27:26,601 --> 00:27:27,841
Guys, take a break.

692
00:27:35,601 --> 00:27:36,601
Liu,

693
00:27:38,001 --> 00:27:39,237
are you using the classroom

694
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,320
for

695
00:27:40,521 --> 00:27:41,521
other purposes?

696
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:43,318
That's right.

697
00:27:43,401 --> 00:27:45,237
I was just planning
to tell you about it.

698
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,278
It's like this. I wish to renovate

699
00:27:47,361 --> 00:27:48,438
the classroom.

700
00:27:48,521 --> 00:27:49,680
After that, I'll rent it out.

701
00:27:51,206 --> 00:27:52,767
That's different from
what we agreed upon.

702
00:27:53,361 --> 00:27:56,481
(Professor, you need to understand
my feelings too.)

703
00:27:56,721 --> 00:27:58,158
Back then, I lent you the place

704
00:27:58,241 --> 00:27:59,997
so that we could

705
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,158
cooperate

706
00:28:01,241 --> 00:28:02,638
and create a win-win situation.

707
00:28:02,721 --> 00:28:06,197
(But you're uninterested in
the TCM industrial park)

708
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,278
(and unwilling to join us.)

709
00:28:07,361 --> 00:28:08,278
You see,

710
00:28:08,361 --> 00:28:09,918
my capability and capital

711
00:28:10,001 --> 00:28:11,761
is limited.

712
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:12,960
Besides,

713
00:28:13,121 --> 00:28:14,237
I need to provide for

714
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,601
my family

715
00:28:16,121 --> 00:28:17,641
and the employees in my company.

716
00:28:18,121 --> 00:28:19,758
I have to be responsible for them.

717
00:28:19,841 --> 00:28:21,481
(It's tough to make a living nowadays.)

718
00:28:22,361 --> 00:28:24,241
(If I do this, at least
I can collect some rent.)

719
00:28:24,361 --> 00:28:26,080
You know this too. I'm passionate

720
00:28:26,241 --> 00:28:27,841
toward TCM too.

721
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,679
But my dear friend,

722
00:28:29,762 --> 00:28:31,601
this might sound harsh,

723
00:28:31,841 --> 00:28:33,481
but we can't make a living
with sentiment alone.

724
00:28:34,361 --> 00:28:36,278
(That's why I could only rent it out)

725
00:28:36,361 --> 00:28:38,160
(after renovating it.)

726
00:28:38,361 --> 00:28:39,798
I have to rent the dorm out too

727
00:28:39,881 --> 00:28:40,881
if it's possible.

728
00:28:41,641 --> 00:28:42,641
You understand?

729
00:28:44,609 --> 00:28:45,631
Fine then.

730
00:29:00,401 --> 00:29:01,401
What about this?

731
00:29:01,721 --> 00:29:02,721
So,

732
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,197
you three can wait outside
for the time being.

733
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,481
Let me deal with them first.

734
00:29:06,841 --> 00:29:08,077
-Alright.
-Thank you.

735
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,077
Guys.

736
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,182
Please.

737
00:29:15,161 --> 00:29:16,638
Ms Dong, it's like this.

738
00:29:16,721 --> 00:29:18,241
For the hands-on technique class,

739
00:29:18,481 --> 00:29:19,721
we have to suspend it for now.

740
00:29:21,401 --> 00:29:22,426
Guys, listen up.

741
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,001
The apprentice class

742
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,521
will be suspended for the time being.

743
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,237
I'll notify you guys

744
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,320
when our class reopens.

745
00:29:34,601 --> 00:29:35,641
Charge!

746
00:29:36,721 --> 00:29:37,841
Okay. Break.

747
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,798
Ms Dong just told us

748
00:29:39,881 --> 00:29:41,280
not to sit on this chair.

749
00:29:41,465 --> 00:29:42,465
Only for a while.

750
00:29:43,401 --> 00:29:44,401
What's going on?

751
00:29:44,601 --> 00:29:45,638
Why are we having a sudden break?

752
00:29:45,721 --> 00:29:46,721
I think everything's fine.

753
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,680
Don't worry.
My father will deal with it.

754
00:29:49,601 --> 00:29:50,601
Tou!

755
00:29:50,761 --> 00:29:51,761
Come here.

756
00:29:52,241 --> 00:29:54,540
-Hurry up.
-Be careful.

757
00:29:55,521 --> 00:29:56,518
What?

758
00:29:56,601 --> 00:29:57,399
For this year's Qixi Festival,

759
00:29:57,482 --> 00:29:59,241
they'll hold a lantern party
at the old street.

760
00:29:59,521 --> 00:30:00,439
Initially, we had class.

761
00:30:00,522 --> 00:30:01,597
Since God has given us

762
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,638
an excellent chance
by suspending our class,

763
00:30:03,721 --> 00:30:05,560
why don't we head there
and enjoy ourselves?

764
00:30:10,801 --> 00:30:11,801
You...

765
00:30:11,888 --> 00:30:12,798
You should've told me

766
00:30:12,881 --> 00:30:14,080
about this earlier.

767
00:30:14,641 --> 00:30:15,559
I heard

768
00:30:15,642 --> 00:30:17,077
that we could even rent Hanfu there.

769
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,158
We should rent some Hanfu

770
00:30:18,241 --> 00:30:20,398
and take some pictures
to commemorate the festival.

771
00:30:20,481 --> 00:30:21,957
Who knows? Maybe this is our last class.

772
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,040
Tou Tou,

773
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:24,717
don't jinx it.

774
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,800
Touch wood.

775
00:30:26,121 --> 00:30:27,481
Meng Meng.

776
00:30:28,481 --> 00:30:30,280
They're heading to the Qixi Festival
lantern party.

777
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,560
Do you want to join them?

778
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,761
But don't we need to apply for leave

779
00:30:36,121 --> 00:30:37,918
from Mr Ren if we wish
to attend the event?

780
00:30:38,001 --> 00:30:39,121
What leave?

781
00:30:39,241 --> 00:30:41,278
-Mr Ren suspended the class.
-Yeah.

782
00:30:41,361 --> 00:30:42,837
We don't even know
where the next class will be held at.

783
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,678
-Yeah.
-We should enjoy ourselves while we can.

784
00:30:44,761 --> 00:30:45,558
That's right.

785
00:30:45,641 --> 00:30:46,641
Let's go.

786
00:30:46,921 --> 00:30:48,238
It's fun.

787
00:30:48,321 --> 00:30:49,717
There are all kinds of games there.

788
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,800
And, they'll sell your
favourite food too.

789
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,080
I'll go there with you.

790
00:30:53,241 --> 00:30:54,241
Do you want to join them?

791
00:30:55,647 --> 00:30:56,798
Okay.

792
00:30:56,881 --> 00:30:57,957
Why are you guys still standing there?

793
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,117
Go and pack your things.

794
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,158
Let's go.

795
00:31:00,241 --> 00:31:01,241
Hurry up!

796
00:31:11,401 --> 00:31:12,401
Rebecca,

797
00:31:13,241 --> 00:31:14,680
you should come with us
to the Qixi Festival lantern party.

798
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,641
No, thanks. I'm not interested.

799
00:31:17,601 --> 00:31:18,918
I advise you guys not to attend it.

800
00:31:19,001 --> 00:31:21,241
Although we have a holiday,
we still have curfews.

801
00:31:21,401 --> 00:31:23,121
Aren't you afraid that someone
might wreck the place?

802
00:31:23,721 --> 00:31:25,001
Someone needs to
keep an eye on the place.

803
00:31:25,241 --> 00:31:27,481
What? Do you want to defend
this place with your life?

804
00:31:28,241 --> 00:31:30,077
I suggest you join us

805
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,241
so that you won't receive
any physical damage.

806
00:31:33,408 --> 00:31:34,408
I'm not afraid.

807
00:31:34,841 --> 00:31:35,841
Even if I do sustain damage,

808
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,080
Ms Dong will cure me.

809
00:31:40,241 --> 00:31:41,241
Fine.

810
00:32:00,881 --> 00:32:02,601
Later, we'll have dinner

811
00:32:02,841 --> 00:32:04,241
at 7pm. Remember to
keep an eye on the group chat.

812
00:32:04,361 --> 00:32:05,638
Okay? 7pm.

813
00:32:05,721 --> 00:32:06,721
Remember, it's 7pm.

814
00:32:06,881 --> 00:32:07,881
Don't forget.

815
00:32:13,761 --> 00:32:14,761
Isn't this adorable?

816
00:32:26,881 --> 00:32:27,881
You want that?

817
00:32:29,721 --> 00:32:30,721
I'll get it for you.

818
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,320
Mister, how much does it cost?

819
00:32:34,601 --> 00:32:35,961
Mister, I'll pay for it. Scan my code.

820
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,641
Thank you, Mr Tian Zhen.

821
00:32:40,721 --> 00:32:41,721
I'll get it for you.

822
00:32:44,841 --> 00:32:45,841
Give me another one.

823
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,240
Here I go.

824
00:33:13,681 --> 00:33:15,601
Tou, you are terrible at this.

825
00:33:17,921 --> 00:33:19,841
-You scared me. What?
-Give them to me.

826
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,841
-Can you do it?
-Here you go.

827
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,760
He got it!

828
00:33:28,921 --> 00:33:30,161
Not bad at all.

829
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:31,601
Do you even know how to play the game?

830
00:33:34,561 --> 00:33:35,561
Meng Meng,

831
00:33:36,161 --> 00:33:37,838
I'm not very good at this.

832
00:33:37,921 --> 00:33:39,520
However, I'm great at
playing claw machines.

833
00:33:39,681 --> 00:33:41,157
If you want a plush toy,

834
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,237
I can get you

835
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,397
the toy you want.

836
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,480
It's hard to say.

837
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,720
We can do it too.

838
00:33:45,954 --> 00:33:47,921
What are you saying?

839
00:33:48,681 --> 00:33:49,758
-You want to play?
-Yeah.

840
00:33:49,841 --> 00:33:51,758
-I'm good at this. Come.
-It's impossible.

841
00:33:51,841 --> 00:33:53,038
Listen, I'll get it on my first try.

842
00:33:53,121 --> 00:33:54,318
You're just wasting your money.

843
00:33:54,401 --> 00:33:55,441
That's impossible. Look.

844
00:33:57,401 --> 00:33:58,441
Let me show you.

845
00:34:07,161 --> 00:34:08,161
Senior,

846
00:34:08,441 --> 00:34:10,401
I don't think I can do that.

847
00:34:11,201 --> 00:34:12,881
(You own many companies
in the tertiary industry.)

848
00:34:13,441 --> 00:34:15,720
Is it that hard for me
to get a classroom?

849
00:34:15,921 --> 00:34:16,927
That's not the hard part.

850
00:34:17,441 --> 00:34:19,520
The hard part is to pacify the people.

851
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,720
You see, if I'm giving you
what you want now,

852
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,040
what should I do

853
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,480
when other people ask me
for the same thing?

854
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,601
If I don't give it to them,
I'll be biased.

855
00:34:26,921 --> 00:34:28,361
(You and I are from the same sect.)

856
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,841
(Just one report letter)

857
00:34:29,961 --> 00:34:31,121
(is enough to land me in trouble.)

858
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,078
I thought you promised

859
00:34:33,161 --> 00:34:34,201
Fellow Zhang

860
00:34:34,401 --> 00:34:35,878
that your academy would help us out

861
00:34:35,961 --> 00:34:37,278
if we were in trouble?

862
00:34:37,361 --> 00:34:39,358
Now, the apprentice class
is in a pickle here.

863
00:34:39,441 --> 00:34:40,601
How do you plan to resolve the issue?

864
00:34:42,562 --> 00:34:43,562
Me?

865
00:34:45,921 --> 00:34:47,157
At most, I can hold one,

866
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,240
two,

867
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:49,530
or even three seminars for you.

868
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,280
(But now, you're asking me
for a classroom.)

869
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,878
And, you'll be using it
for quite a few years.

870
00:34:53,961 --> 00:34:55,401
The thing is,
you're not paying rent for it.

871
00:34:56,121 --> 00:34:57,881
How can I explain myself
to the higher-ups?

872
00:35:00,841 --> 00:35:01,841
What about this?

873
00:35:02,393 --> 00:35:03,873
For the sake of your apprentice class,

874
00:35:04,441 --> 00:35:07,480
I'll sacrifice my career.

875
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,681
I'll resign

876
00:35:10,121 --> 00:35:11,520
(and be the class teacher)

877
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,040
(for the apprentice class.)

878
00:35:13,201 --> 00:35:16,601
I'll be thick-skinned and go out
to ask for donations.

879
00:35:17,401 --> 00:35:18,401
What do you think?

880
00:35:18,506 --> 00:35:19,506
Stop your pointless chatter.

881
00:35:21,266 --> 00:35:22,266
Fine.

882
00:35:22,961 --> 00:35:23,961
I'll think of something myself.

883
00:35:43,601 --> 00:35:45,441
Your lot

884
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:49,720
is the best out of all.

885
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,520
That's all?

886
00:35:53,641 --> 00:35:55,637
Is this a good thing or a bad thing?

887
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,441
-I didn't get it.
-Yeah. Tell us the details.

888
00:35:57,601 --> 00:36:00,320
-Is it good or bad?
-Late bloomer.

889
00:36:01,361 --> 00:36:03,401
How late is late?

890
00:36:03,921 --> 00:36:09,280
According to how
modern people calculate age,

891
00:36:09,921 --> 00:36:12,080
it'll be around 60 years old.

892
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,040
60 years old?

893
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,080
That's pretty good.

894
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,358
People always seek out

895
00:36:19,441 --> 00:36:20,798
senior TCM practitioners.

896
00:36:20,881 --> 00:36:24,467
That's not it. Both of my parents made
a name for themselves at a young age.

897
00:36:24,551 --> 00:36:26,878
But I'm only making a name for myself
at 60? Do you think that's appropriate?

898
00:36:26,962 --> 00:36:30,203
Yeah. Why not? I think it's good
enough to make a name for yourself.

899
00:36:30,361 --> 00:36:31,397
Look at me.

900
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,800
I'll stay like this
for the rest of my life.

901
00:36:33,041 --> 00:36:34,878
I'm the same even when I'm 80.

902
00:36:34,961 --> 00:36:36,000
Are you trying

903
00:36:36,418 --> 00:36:37,418
to console me?

904
00:36:40,201 --> 00:36:41,201
I don't think so.

905
00:36:44,601 --> 00:36:46,441
Let's check out the other stalls.

906
00:36:46,641 --> 00:36:47,641
Alright.

907
00:36:47,825 --> 00:36:49,264
-Let's check them out.
-They're selling food.

908
00:36:49,777 --> 00:36:50,857
-Meng Meng, let's go.
-Let's go.

909
00:36:51,018 --> 00:36:52,018
Let's go.

910
00:37:00,641 --> 00:37:01,641
Excuse me.

911
00:37:02,201 --> 00:37:03,201
Let me ask you something.

912
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,721
Are you a human or a robot?

913
00:37:06,441 --> 00:37:09,961
Sir, what other questions do you have?

914
00:37:10,873 --> 00:37:12,353
It's fine. Thank you.

915
00:37:17,533 --> 00:37:18,756
One of them

916
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,080
is a late bloomer

917
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,441
while the other one is a prodigy.

918
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,961
What should we do now?

919
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,760
I just feel apologetic

920
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,560
toward Ms Dong.

921
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,560
You always led a reclusive life.

922
00:37:39,961 --> 00:37:40,961
Now,

923
00:37:41,529 --> 00:37:42,849
you're here.

924
00:37:43,161 --> 00:37:45,237
But we don't even have a classroom
for you to teach them.

925
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,800
Yeah, it's all my fault.

926
00:37:47,601 --> 00:37:48,961
I should've expected this to happen

927
00:37:49,161 --> 00:37:51,841
when I severed my ties
with them.

928
00:37:52,401 --> 00:37:53,401
Actually, they're not obliged

929
00:37:53,633 --> 00:37:54,913
to help us out

930
00:37:55,089 --> 00:37:56,569
for free.

931
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:58,185
Businessmen

932
00:37:58,648 --> 00:38:01,057
value profit over righteousness.

933
00:38:01,785 --> 00:38:02,957
That's a hasty generalization.

934
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,359
There are many
righteous businessmen too.

935
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,920
Master,

936
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:11,777
you always told me

937
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,441
that if I have an idea,

938
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,800
everything will fall into place.

939
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,080
I had this idea

940
00:38:16,601 --> 00:38:17,641
for a long time.

941
00:38:17,921 --> 00:38:19,038
Why isn't anyone

942
00:38:19,121 --> 00:38:20,681
giving me a classroom?

943
00:38:21,161 --> 00:38:22,397
You see,

944
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,841
that only works

945
00:38:24,201 --> 00:38:25,201
when you're Buddha.

946
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,197
You still have a long way to go.

947
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,280
You're right.

948
00:38:29,601 --> 00:38:30,681
You see,

949
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:32,609
knowledge and action
should go hand in hand.

950
00:38:33,441 --> 00:38:35,760
From realising
the righteousness of the event

951
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,518
to the completion of the event,

952
00:38:37,601 --> 00:38:38,601
everything else in between

953
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,240
acts as your trial.

954
00:38:41,641 --> 00:38:44,121
God is giving you an ordeal

955
00:38:44,361 --> 00:38:46,121
called The Dignity Ordeal.

956
00:38:48,601 --> 00:38:49,641
Master, you're right.

957
00:38:51,641 --> 00:38:53,358
Master, I'll be honest with you.

958
00:38:53,441 --> 00:38:55,280
In the past, I didn't think

959
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,280
that this industry was that tough.

960
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,201
But now, it's...

961
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,520
Think about it.

962
00:39:03,401 --> 00:39:04,881
Throughout your career,

963
00:39:05,681 --> 00:39:06,681
you were talented

964
00:39:07,401 --> 00:39:08,997
and you had academic qualifications.

965
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,080
And,

966
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,758
you had elders like us

967
00:39:11,841 --> 00:39:12,961
backing you up.

968
00:39:13,361 --> 00:39:15,120
Of course you had a smooth journey.

969
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,440
You're right.

970
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,676
Now,

971
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,040
I'm old.

972
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:22,361
I'm afraid I won't be able
to back you up anymore.

973
00:39:22,841 --> 00:39:24,121
I'm afraid you need to back me up

974
00:39:24,961 --> 00:39:27,121
in the future.

975
00:39:28,441 --> 00:39:30,841
Dad, such chatter is meaningless.

976
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:32,917
Now, we need to figure out a way

977
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,401
to resolve this issue.

978
00:39:34,681 --> 00:39:39,039
Yeah.
Ms Dong,

979
00:39:39,122 --> 00:39:40,358
I'm truly sorry.

980
00:39:40,441 --> 00:39:42,441
We invited you all the way here,

981
00:39:42,681 --> 00:39:43,681
however,

982
00:39:43,841 --> 00:39:45,358
we don't even have a place

983
00:39:45,441 --> 00:39:46,641
for you to teach them.

984
00:39:46,921 --> 00:39:47,921
That's fine.

985
00:39:49,401 --> 00:39:50,401
When we decide

986
00:39:51,681 --> 00:39:53,401
to take the righteous path,

987
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,320
we have to put in much more effort

988
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,720
than taking the back door.

989
00:39:58,601 --> 00:39:59,677
God will test you

990
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,961
repeatedly

991
00:40:01,587 --> 00:40:02,867
to see

992
00:40:03,747 --> 00:40:05,626
whether you're truly sincere
in taking this path.

993
00:40:07,592 --> 00:40:08,592
If you can pass God's test

994
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,560
every time without changing your goal,

995
00:40:11,121 --> 00:40:13,000
you'll achieve what you wish for.

996
00:40:15,641 --> 00:40:16,641
In my opinion,

997
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
this isn't even

998
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,720
an ordeal for you.

999
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,000
You're an academician.

1000
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,459
You published books and
made a name for yourself.

1001
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,280
But people like us?

1002
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,841
It's quite difficult for us

1003
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,641
to pass our legacy
to the next generation.

1004
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,361
In Taoism,

1005
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:36,841
masters will look for
their own disciples.

1006
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,441
I agreed to join your class

1007
00:40:39,961 --> 00:40:41,441
not because to help you out.

1008
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,520
I'm helping myself out.

1009
00:40:44,465 --> 00:40:45,465
I was thinking

1010
00:40:45,593 --> 00:40:46,593
that I'll encounter a disciple

1011
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:49,209
who's a kindred spirit
if I teach enough classes.

1012
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,740
Maybe that person is willing
to inherit our legacy

1013
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,080
without changing anything.

1014
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,840
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

1015
00:40:59,921 --> 00:41:01,436
(are referenced from relevant
traditional Chinese medicine books)

1016
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,234
