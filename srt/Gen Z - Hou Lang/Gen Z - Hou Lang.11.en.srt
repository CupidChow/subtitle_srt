1
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,360
It's common for children to catch a cold

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,680
or have a fever.

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,400
We TCM practitioners have been
studying this topic

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,840
for millenniums.

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,600
Let me recommend someone to you.

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,000
What about the son
of Professor Ren, Tian Zhen?

7
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,520
He studied TCM since young.

8
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,360
Diagnosing minor illnesses as such

9
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,600
is second nature to him.

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,400
And, he's good at

11
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,280
both TCM Acupuncture

12
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,760
and brewing medicine.

13
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,640
Mr Zheng, you don't
need to worry at all.

14
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,320
Mr Ren,

15
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,160
I'm a paediatrician.

16
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:33,960
I should go.

17
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,800
This is the territory of
TCM practitioners.

18
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,800
You can stay here.

19
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,280
But when it comes to sick children...

20
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,640
Mr Ren, I'll go.

21
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,040
Li Quan will do.

22
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,520
He and Tian Zhen are classmates.

23
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,160
Both of them are
Professor Ren's students.

24
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,840
We can assess their result.

25
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,200
Yes.

26
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,000
Professor Ren, Mr Wu,

27
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,440
I do acknowledge

28
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,760
their academic qualifications.

29
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,480
However, I was only given
this daughter in my old age.

30
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,680
She was spoiled since young.

31
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,400
Her body is weak.

32
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,160
Having a fever might be a minor illness.

33
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,360
But she contracted pneumonia

34
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,400
and got a hormone shot

35
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,480
for a fever last year.

36
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,240
Although it didn't develop into asthma,

37
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,080
she still

38
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,000
wheezes from time to time.

39
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,080
Professor Ren,

40
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:17,960
please give her a diagnosis.

41
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,240
Look at how anxious he is.

42
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,320
You see.

43
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,600
-It'll be fine.
-Uncle.

44
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,840
I wish to send Tou Tou there.

45
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,520
Tou Tou?

46
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,440
She only started studying
TCM not long ago.

47
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,240
You should send Li Quan and Tian Zhen.

48
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,600
Don't be careless.

49
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,600
Mr Zheng, let me tell you this.

50
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,840
This junior of mine

51
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,600
is the successor of
the Jiang family's acupuncture sect.

52
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,240
She's the bloodline.

53
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,920
Junior,

54
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,640
you should go there.

55
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,360
This is inappropriate.

56
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,760
How could we trouble

57
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,000
the successor with such a minor matter?

58
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,840
Look.

59
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,160
He still doesn't believe
in the successor.

60
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,240
So, you're afraid that
you'll trouble her.

61
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,600
What about me?

62
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,600
That's right.

63
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,320
We're friends for many years.

64
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,600
I'll join her.

65
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,440
Mr Ren,

66
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,920
are you sure you want her to do it?

67
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,240
Wait.

68
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,880
My daughter is afraid of needles.

69
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,960
It's hard to keep her under control
when she starts crying.

70
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,520
Can she take medicinal brew then?

71
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,760
No.

72
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,640
We let her try it when she was little.

73
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,760
She couldn't take it.

74
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,840
There's no need for
any medicine or needles.

75
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,240
Where's your kitchen?

76
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,840
Kitchen?

77
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,160
You put that much?

78
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:41,920
Done.

79
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,840
This is it?

80
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,960
Kitchen cures everything.

81
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,800
Take it to her.

82
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,640
Tell her to take it while it's hot.

83
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,040
Tou Tou, what are you doing?

84
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,240
I'm making egg yolk oil.

85
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,920
Egg yolk oil doesn't cure
the common cold.

86
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,000
I know.

87
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,360
Stop messing around.

88
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,200
I'm not.

89
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,440
Wait outside.

90
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,640
Done.

91
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,400
You're done?

92
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,600
Let's go.

93
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,920
She finished the soup, right?

94
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,000
Yes, but...

95
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,000
What do you mean?

96
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,800
What happened after that?

97
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,440
Tang Tang said

98
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,880
it tasted like instant noodles'
soup base.

99
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,440
Will this work?

100
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,160
That's not the soup base
of instant noodles.

101
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,160
That's Sun Tou Tou's

102
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,800
unique fever medicine.

103
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,880
It just tastes similar.

104
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,640
You see.

105
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,360
She's sweating.

106
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,080
This should be what the book
meant by "perspire".

107
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,160
Tou Tou.

108
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,360
I saw something just now.

109
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,440
There's a scratch wound here.

110
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,600
What's going on?

111
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,000
I don't know.

112
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,160
Ever since she was stung by
bugs in Hainan four months ago,

113
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,920
she had rashes.

114
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,320
The more she scratched it,
the bigger it grew.

115
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,920
It's also filled with pus.

116
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,680
Once a scab is formed,
it'll crack again.

117
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,760
She suffered because of it.

118
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,760
She's still like this

119
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,200
even after applying all kinds
of ointments and medicine.

120
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,640
If so, you can put this oil

121
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,240
in a bottle.

122
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,400
You can rub it on her skin

123
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,760
every day.

124
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,040
It'll take around three to five days.

125
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,520
She should recover as long as
she doesn't scratch them again.

126
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,840
She won't be itchy after applying it.

127
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,080
What kind of oil is this?

128
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,040
-I'll leave it here.
-This is the egg...

129
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,400
You don't even remember the name?

130
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,240
This is Shendan Oil,

131
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,600
which Master treasures a lot.

132
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,720
What are you saying?

133
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,720
You don't even remember the name.

134
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,200
Shendan Oil is very precious.

135
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,480
It doesn't contain any
chemicals or additives.

136
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,120
It's child-friendly.

137
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,440
And, it's very precious.

138
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,080
It's used

139
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,200
to treat all kinds of rashes.

140
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,960
Judging from Tang Tang's condition,

141
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,600
her fever should subside

142
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,760
in half an hour.

143
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,880
Don't be too worried.

144
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,800
-Thank you.
-Don't mention it.

145
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,440
If her fever doesn't subside
in half an hour,

146
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,920
I'll look for your master.

147
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,960
That's impossible...

148
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,360
Alright.

149
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,560
You didn't utter a single word of truth.

150
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,760
The ordinary egg yolk oil

151
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,000
became Master's precious Shendan Oil
when you describe it.

152
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,320
If she knows that the oil is cheap,

153
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,240
easy to obtain,

154
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,400
and made by me,

155
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,600
do you think she'll use it?

156
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,920
Look at how huge her house is.

157
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,120
Will she believe me?

158
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,040
Tell me.

159
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,040
You read Tang Tang's pulse, right?
How was it?

160
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,200
She's fine. It's not a huge issue.

161
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,320
Good.

162
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,040
How did you know that
Tang Tang has eczema?

163
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,320
I read her pulse.

164
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,680
You're full of nonsense, aren't you?

165
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,320
I'll call you Master if you can

166
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,440
diagnose that by reading pulse.

167
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,480
Good grandson.

168
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,280
Why don't I check it out?

169
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,200
You want to go there?

170
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,120
It'll be too late by then.

171
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm joking.

172
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,080
I meant,

173
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,640
it'd be too late for
Shan Dao to go there

174
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,760
as the child would've recovered by then.

175
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,720
Senior,

176
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,640
when it comes to giving a diagnosis,

177
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,680
we're equals.

178
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,560
But when it comes to bragging,

179
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,200
I'm no match for you.

180
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,200
That's why

181
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,960
my reputation in the industry

182
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,400
is a little worse than yours.

183
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,680
It's all because I can't brag.

184
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,520
Junior.

185
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,080
How did it go?

186
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,280
Senior, there's no need to worry.

187
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:39,920
Tou,

188
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,680
you're something else.

189
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,760
You actually cured her

190
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,720
of her complicated ailments.

191
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,560
Tang Tang is awake.
Her fever has subsided.

192
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,920
She said she wanted some fried chicken.

193
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,440
Don't give her that.

194
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,360
Her fever will come back.

195
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,280
Her fever usually lasts

196
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,840
for one week.

197
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,000
What about this?

198
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,760
Make some porridge for her.

199
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,760
Make it

200
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,000
with rice bran oil.

201
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,280
That can warm her stomach.

202
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,160
Tou Tou,

203
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,520
what medicine did you give
the child just now?

204
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,880
Hot pot soup.

205
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,520
Hot pot soup?

206
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,080
Good job.

207
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,760
The successor of
the Jiang family's acupuncture sect

208
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,760
is excellent indeed.

209
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,680
She has mastered

210
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,200
the Treatise On Febrile Diseases
Caused By Cold.

211
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,440
Mr Zheng,

212
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,440
you don't need to worry at all.

213
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,880
With her skills,

214
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,040
your daughter

215
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,400
will be fine.

216
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,600
You see,

217
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,520
fever on children
usually lasts for one week.

218
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,760
Usually,

219
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,840
they'll perspire

220
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,200
after taking fever medicine.

221
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,200
Although it relieves her condition
on the surface,

222
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,600
it also

223
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,080
affects her health.

224
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,160
When her body is weak,

225
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,320
pathogen will attack her body.

226
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,560
After your daughter

227
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,280
consumed the hot pot soup

228
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,320
made by her,

229
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,160
her body will grow strong.

230
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,080
She'll be fine within a few days.

231
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,480
Xin Zheng,

232
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,560
you did great in teaching your student.

233
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,280
Don't get too full of yourself.

234
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,520
This is only your first patient.

235
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,640
I'm not full at all.

236
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,520
I just think

237
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,200
that your father didn't deceive me.

238
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,080
Saving real kids

239
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,120
is much more fun than
playing with claw machines.

240
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,880
There's a delicate feeling

241
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,440
that I cannot describe.

242
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,040
What do you think?

243
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,800
You win again.

244
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,400
Professor Ren, thank you so much.

245
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,080
Your Shendan Oil

246
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,520
worked miraculously.

247
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,760
You're an expert
in the TCM industry indeed.

248
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,160
However, where can we get

249
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,320
such precious commodity

250
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,520
when we need it in the future?

251
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,440
-Do you still feel itchy?
-No.

252
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,520
You don't feel itchy now?

253
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,960
Actually, this oil

254
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,080
cannot be found anywhere.

255
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,760
What about this?
I'll bring it for your child

256
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,760
when I visit you guys next time
if she needs it.

257
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,080
Thank you in advance then.

258
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,040
Don't mention it.

259
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,400
Remember to rest well.

260
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,000
-Goodbye.
-Say goodbye.

261
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,040
Thank the miss

262
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,200
and the mister.

263
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,240
What?

264
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,680
What oil did you give her?

265
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,480
Egg yolk oil.

266
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,040
You taught this in class.

267
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,000
You quoted a saying from Li Shi Zhen.

268
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,760
Egg yolk oil is excellent
for itching skin, rashes

269
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,000
with wound.

270
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,520
You're promising indeed.

271
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,760
We studied together.

272
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,240
Why didn't I think of that?

273
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,240
You're good at learning

274
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
while Tou Tou is good at implementing.

275
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,160
I have a pretty good memory.

276
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,640
I'm putting what I learned to practice.

277
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,640
You see, Chinese culture

278
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,080
is all about putting
what you learned to practice.

279
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,440
But Western culture,

280
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,880
they focus on learning
for the sake of learning.

281
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,080
You see, we can't say

282
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,120
that some knowledge is useless.

283
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,880
But we learn some of them

284
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,280
just to make us happy.

285
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,760
Mr Zheng,

286
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,280
please don't see us off.

287
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,440
This is far enough.

288
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,400
Fellow Zhang, we prepared
some gifts for you.

289
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,320
This is Pu'er tea.

290
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,520
This is a five-year
Ambrosia artemisiifolia.

291
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,640
Mr Zheng, your gifts

292
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,160
are extremely precious.

293
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,880
However, a person like me

294
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,880
takes delight in experiencing nature.

295
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,120
I'm afraid such valuable gifts
are a waste if you give them to me.

296
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,560
Alright then.

297
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,440
I'll present these gifts

298
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,000
to my junior.

299
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,680
Tou Tou.

300
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,400
Tou Tou.

301
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,680
Take them.

302
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,680
I'm giving you his gifts.

303
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,520
-Thank you.
-Alright.

304
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,600
However, I'm sincere
in giving them to you.

305
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,320
After meeting Junior,

306
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:58,000
I finally understood the phrase
"born with knowledge".

307
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,120
You must study hard under your master.

308
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,520
Chinese civilization
is deep and complex.

309
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,480
We have to depend on
youngsters like you all

310
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,080
to carry forward the culture.

311
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,440
Alright, I'll make a move now.

312
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,640
-See you.
-Okay.

313
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,120
-Goodbye, Great-uncle.
-Goodbye, Uncle.

314
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,680
-Take it.
-A five-year Ambrosia artemisiifolia?

315
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,760
That's precious.

316
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,520
(Minor Heat, signifying
high temperature.)

317
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,120
(It's not the hottest period yet.)

318
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:50,080
(New grains will be ready for harvest
in the South after Minor Heat.)

319
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,400
(The North has a habit of having
dumplings during this period.)

320
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:00,600
(Minor Heat)

321
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,920
(Abundant throughout The Seasons)

322
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,400
(Qibo Medical Centre)

323
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,440
Professor Ren,

324
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,320
I have to express my gratitude.

325
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,080
I benefited a lot

326
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,840
from your class.

327
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,400
I was suddenly enlightened.

328
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,440
It worked better than taking medicine.

329
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,640
Tell me then. How were you enlightened?

330
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,160
I got a divorce.

331
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,320
I didn't tell you
to get a divorce, right?

332
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,360
Yes, you didn't tell me to do so.

333
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,560
However, during your class, you said

334
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,320
we should discard

335
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,760
everything

336
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,520
that causes us

337
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,480
to have negative emotions

338
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,880
and throw them away.

339
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,680
Only then will there be enough space

340
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,200
for positive emotions to be generated

341
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,280
and return to our bodies.

342
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,880
That's right.

343
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,840
There's an old saying.

344
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,440
Marriage should be protected

345
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,160
at all costs.

346
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,200
I have to be held accountable
for this now.

347
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,280
That's not it.

348
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,320
Not at all.

349
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,600
It has nothing to do with you.

350
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,080
You did a great deed.

351
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,560
I benefited a lot

352
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,880
from your class.

353
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,000
Now,

354
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,440
I've gotten over them.

355
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,280
I discovered an issue.

356
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,320
What I desire in the past
is completely opposite

357
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,240
from what I desire

358
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,120
right now.

359
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,000
If I insist on keeping them,

360
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,760
that will make me selfish.

361
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,200
If so,

362
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,760
what do you desire?

363
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,320
Back then, I wanted someone
who didn't love me

364
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,680
to fall for me.

365
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,080
But now,

366
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,680
all those thoughts have disappeared.

367
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,520
Professor Ren,

368
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,560
wouldn't it be great

369
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,360
if you turned it into an online lesson?

370
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,960
Although

371
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,200
you were holding that class

372
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,560
for your TCM students,

373
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,200
people like me

374
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,440
with zero knowledge

375
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,400
actually benefited a lot

376
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,400
from a single class.

377
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,760
I'm sure a lot of people would
benefit from this greatly

378
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,360
if we put it online.

379
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,760
We can use your medical centre

380
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,200
to turn you

381
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,520
into a popular female influencer.

382
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,880
That's difficult.

383
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,360
Not at all.

384
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,520
It's very difficult.

385
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,560
You see,

386
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,680
I'm a man after all.

387
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,880
You're right.

388
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,600
Look.

389
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,640
The kids

390
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,160
are getting along well.

391
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,600
Children

392
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,440
should spend time with each other

393
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,240
to grow well.

394
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,680
Jian Xi

395
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,560
has been in a good mood lately.

396
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,760
She wants me to bring her here

397
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,760
whenever she wakes up.

398
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,200
This snack is delicious.

399
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,680
-It has fillings?
-Yeah.

400
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,080
The physicians here

401
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,040
are very friendly too.

402
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,080
-Try it.
-They're nice to us.

403
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,760
Look.

404
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,960
We also have Meng Meng,
who's almost the same age as her

405
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,000
to keep her company.

406
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,680
When I look at them,

407
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,600
I feel as if everything
has gotten better.

408
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,880
I wish to apply for leave next week.

409
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,480
Do you have something to do?

410
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,560
It's all thanks to Professor Ren.

411
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,800
He shared my post

412
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,120
I made to look for tiles.

413
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,160
Many people viewed it.

414
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,360
I received two DMs.

415
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,640
The information was pretty complete.

416
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,920
I wish to look for them.

417
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,640
Alright.

418
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,880
I hope you can find them this time.

419
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,640
Don't worry.

420
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,800
I won't give up

421
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,000
even if I don't find them this time.

422
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,800
Maybe I'll find them next time.

423
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,080
Yeah.

424
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,360
Nothing is impossible.

425
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,040
When there's a will, there's a way.

426
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,240
That's right.

427
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,800
So,

428
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,680
how long will you be away?

429
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,640
The place is pretty far away.

430
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,840
It's out of the province.

431
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,440
I will be away for at least one week.

432
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,800
What about Jian Xi then?

433
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,080
That's what I'm fretting about.

434
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,200
So,

435
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,080
why don't you

436
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,000
let Jian Xi live with us?

437
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,200
I can take care of her.

438
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,840
Xia,

439
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,360
you can let Jian Xi live with us

440
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,080
while you look for the tiles.

441
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,920
I'll send her here

442
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,320
every morning.

443
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,160
I'll pick her up and bring her home
every evening.

444
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,160
What do you think?

445
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,800
Don't worry.

446
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,920
How could I not worry?

447
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,920
You might suffer a relapse
at any given time.

448
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,440
What if you go berserk

449
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,600
and do something crazy again?

450
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,080
Jian Xi is in this state because of you.

451
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,240
I can't entrust her to your care.

452
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,920
I've already gotten a divorce.

453
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,200
I've already discarded
my negative emotions.

454
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,600
I plan to start a new life.

455
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,920
Jian Xi is in this state because of me.

456
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,920
I'll surely take responsibility for it.

457
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,560
Here's a bank card.

458
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,160
Inside it,

459
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,600
there's a sum

460
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,800
I received after getting a divorce.

461
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,160
I didn't use a single cent.

462
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,280
You can have all of it.

463
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,360
Use it to treat Jian Xi's condition.

464
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,680
What about you and your son then?

465
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,720
I'm still around.

466
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,360
I can provide for him when I work.

467
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,560
You need the money more than me.

468
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,640
Just take it.

469
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,280
Zhu Xia.

470
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,000
Just take it.

471
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:13,880
You can entrust

472
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,440
Jian Xi to her too.

473
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,360
This way, you can proceed with
your mission without any worries.

474
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,440
Yeah.

475
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,160
Xia, may you achieve success.

476
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,840
We need to brew medicine
for Jian Xi every day, right?

477
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,840
Great.

478
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,400
I need to brew medicine for myself too.

479
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,000
I'll brew hers as well.

480
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,320
What do you think?

481
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,320
Tou Tou,

482
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,440
you'd better not make things
explode again.

483
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,680
I know. Don't worry. This time,

484
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,520
I won't drink or sleep.

485
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,400
I promise I'll finish brewing
Meng Meng's medicine.

486
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,880
By the way,

487
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,920
have you finished copying
Virtue of A Great Physician?

488
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,280
You'd better complete it by this month.

489
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,040
Your master will check it tomorrow.

490
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,440
Wait.

491
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,760
He'll check it?

492
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,040
What do you mean by that?

493
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,440
Why does he need

494
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,640
to check it after I'm done copying it?

495
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,520
It'll only be considered a homework
if an assessment is made.

496
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,160
Wait.

497
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,680
That's...

498
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,240
-I copied it but...
-What?

499
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,680
Did you not copy it?

500
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,760
I...

501
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,680
She did copy it.

502
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,360
But she threw them everywhere.

503
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,360
I'm sure she can't find them now.

504
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,240
How did you know?

505
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,000
Save me.

506
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,080
Niece-in-law, save me.

507
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,920
Tian Zhen, what did you say just now?

508
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,840
Niece-in-law, save me!

509
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,920
Tian Zhen, what did you say just now?

510
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,280
Save me!

511
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,560
Save me.

512
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,840
The medicine!

513
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,760
Save me!

514
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,520
Professor Ren, you have a noble vision.

515
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,000
Don't worry.

516
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,480
We're your sidekicks.

517
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,840
That's right.

518
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,160
We'll definitely assist you

519
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,720
in achieving your goal.

520
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,080
Our nation has introduced many policies

521
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,880
to develop the TCM industry.

522
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,120
Coincidentally, we can

523
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,160
use this opportunity to our advantage

524
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,400
and rise to a new height.

525
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,520
Mr Liu,

526
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,720
you'll be in charge of
setting the table.

527
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,160
Professor Ren,

528
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,760
you can set the pace
and do what you do best.

529
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,120
As for us,

530
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,520
we'll just assist you guys backstage.

531
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,720
That's right.

532
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,560
We'll be in charge of

533
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,840
the cheers.

534
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,160
We have to give it our all.

535
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,720
Good wine needs no bush.

536
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,320
Everyone, look at the liquor.

537
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,080
We know that it's brewed with grains.

538
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,960
However, if we don't look at the brand,

539
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,960
if you don't drink it, and
if I don't tell you what liquor it is,

540
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,880
do you know

541
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,560
what flavour it is?

542
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,760
I took a sniff just now.

543
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,800
It's Luzhou-flavoured.

544
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,240
Amazing.

545
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,800
Professor Ren is amazing.

546
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,280
Amazing. Did you guys see that?

547
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,000
Professor Ren,

548
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,120
you're the real deal.

549
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,280
You're not an empty husk.

550
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,040
All of us know that.

551
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,360
However, not everyone in the world
knows about that.

552
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,760
Am I right?

553
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,120
Look at all the scammers out there

554
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,880
giving people

555
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,160
fake prescriptions like mung beans

556
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,200
and flower petals.

557
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,160
They made a huge fortune out of it.

558
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,000
But Professor Ren,

559
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,280
you've got nothing out of it.

560
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,120
I feel sorry for you.

561
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,240
Yeah, I feel the same.

562
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,240
Professor Ren, I think there's an issue
with your mindset.

563
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,720
You can stick to a simple diet.

564
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,760
However, have you ever thought of
the younger generations?

565
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,280
Have you ever thought of
your students' feelings?

566
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,800
Why do so many phenomenal youths

567
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,240
are doing investments

568
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,680
alongside Warren Buffett?

569
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,360
It's because he's rich.

570
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,680
Being rich

571
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,560
is the most obvious strength

572
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,000
for all laymen to see.

573
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,800
That's why

574
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,240
ambitious youths chose

575
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,640
to follow him.

576
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,560
Does Warren Buffett love money?

577
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,680
I don't think so.

578
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,320
He bought his house for 50,000 dollars.

579
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,880
His favourite burger

580
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,400
only costs eight dollars.

581
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,280
So, you see,

582
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,240
Professor Ren, you can choose
to donate your money when you're rich.

583
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,200
However, you mustn't stay poor.

584
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,800
If you're poor,

585
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,600
no one is willing to study under you.

586
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,440
That makes total sense.

587
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,440
You're the banner of the TCM industry.

588
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,920
You're our symbol.

589
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,800
With you around,

590
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,280
the revival of the TCM industry

591
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,760
is just around the corner.

592
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,920
This is just the beginning.

593
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,840
The TCM industrial park

594
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,040
is just like a piece of land.

595
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,360
The apprentice class

596
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,280
is just like a seed.

597
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,040
Professor Ren is the sun and rain.

598
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,000
As for the rest,

599
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,200
you guys are in charge of
watering and fertilizing the field.

600
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,320
By then,

601
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,280
when my tree

602
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,080
is filled with fruits,

603
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,440
we can share
the fruits of labour together.

604
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,080
Good.

605
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,680
Mr Liu, I agree with you.

606
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,760
If so, let's pray that this seed of ours

607
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,000
can grow into

608
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,200
a huge tree.

609
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,360
Here.

610
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,760
Let's have a toast.

611
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,640
Come.

612
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,400
Come.

613
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,320
Come. I'll replace liquor with tea.

614
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,280
Come.

615
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,560
What about this?

616
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,880
Guys,

617
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,600
I'm truly touched

618
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,560
by your support for the TCM industry.

619
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,040
Before I drink,

620
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,880
I wish to express

621
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,400
my stand clearly.

622
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,160
This way, at least

623
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,040
your excellent liquor won't go to waste.

624
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,160
You see,

625
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,040
I call a spade a spade.

626
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,400
Warren Buffett is Warren Buffett.

627
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,560
I am me.

628
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,920
In the end,

629
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,480
you and I aren't working for
our own sake.

630
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:07,160
Let's not talk about
carrying forward the culture.

631
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,880
That's just being boastful.

632
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,440
First, we have to confirm

633
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,320
the definition of wealth.

634
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,040
So, what is wealth?

635
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,040
Wealth doesn't mean

636
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,040
the amount of money
you have in your bank account.

637
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,560
If you don't spend that money

638
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,160
on somewhere useful,

639
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,400
it'll be a waste.

640
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,440
For example,

641
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,520
if you buy a house of
1,000 square meters,

642
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,320
that means you're the slave
of that house.

643
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,560
If you buy a ten million yuan car,

644
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,680
I don't think the insurance company

645
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,280
will insure your car.

646
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,840
So guys, what's the definition
of insurance?

647
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,560
It's God.

648
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,760
God has a ledger.

649
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,680
If you're on the righteous path,

650
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,880
you can just give it your all
without any hesitations.

651
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,640
However, if you're not,

652
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,560
God will see everything.

653
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,160
God can tell.

654
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,280
You're being petty,

655
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,760
you have ulterior motives, and so on.

656
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,040
Therefore, being a doctor

657
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,640
is different from other occupations.

658
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,560
If doctors

659
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,920
want to strike it rich,

660
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,200
God will punish us.

661
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,800
Let's just take

662
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,320
my apprentice class as an example.

663
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,680
Maybe the apprentice class

664
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,640
might be a long

665
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,320
and fruitless process.

666
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,840
Maybe it'll bear fruit.

667
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,640
That means

668
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,080
we might not be able to witness
the result in our lifetime.

669
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,240
I'm sure you guys know this too.

670
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,760
It takes ten years to nurture a tree,

671
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,320
but a hundred years to train a man.

672
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,200
If you all wish

673
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,440
to gain something from this,

674
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,400
you shouldn't use the name of TCM.

675
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,320
I'm not smart.

676
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,440
But I'm not silly either.

677
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,640
Mr Liu, in the future,

678
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,000
you shouldn't hold gatherings like this.

679
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,800
It's not worth it

680
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,280
to spend your money on someone like me.

681
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:22,880
It's not worth it.

682
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,440
Here, let's have a toast.

683
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,800
Excellent liquor.

684
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,000
You scared me.

685
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,280
I thought your father was here.

686
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,400
Aren't you going to hand in
your homework tomorrow?

687
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,360
I have so much work to complete.

688
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:11,920
I gave it some thought.

689
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,280
I can't finish copying them anyway.

690
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,040
It's better to let your father
punish me.

691
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,720
This way, it's satisfying
for both him and me.

692
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,560
My father never punishes people.

693
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:21,880
Is that so?

694
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,360
He'll chase you out directly.

695
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,760
This is no fun.

696
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,280
He chases people out?

697
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,800
How could I finish

698
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,600
copying all of them?

699
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,080
Look at them.

700
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,280
Give it to me.

701
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,840
-What are you doing?
-Make way.

702
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:47,920
Wait.

703
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,000
Grandson, what are you doing?

704
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,560
Could it be that
you're trying to help me?

705
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,080
To be honest,

706
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,000
it's pretty difficult to imitate

707
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,640
your terrible writing.

708
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,640
I've left some space for you.

709
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,560
Just fill in the blanks.

710
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,560
Understood.

711
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,720
Ling Ju?

712
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,280
You're using your left hand?

713
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,520
Are you sure you can do it?

714
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,520
My left hand is better than your right.

715
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,480
Why don't you use your foot then?

716
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,760
Use your toes

717
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,040
to grab the brush.

718
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,600
Grab it and write it like this.

719
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,200
Can you do it?

720
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,640
Can you write it backhand?

721
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,920
Like this.

722
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,120
Like this.

723
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:50,960
Like this.

724
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,000
Like this.

725
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,000
What about this?

726
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,920
What about this?

727
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,440
Put your arm at the back.

728
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,560
This is pretty cool.

729
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,800
What about this? Try and lift your leg.

730
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:05,880
Can you do it like this?

731
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,240
Grandson.

732
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,880
I recognise

733
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,160
all these characters.

734
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,840
But I just don't understand them.

735
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,200
What's the use of
writing and memorizing them

736
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,280
every day?

737
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,680
It'll be useful eventually.

738
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,600
It's an enlightening process.

739
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,520
Maybe you'll be enlightened one day.

740
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,400
You recited it every day since young.

741
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,680
Were you enlightened?

742
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,120
Were you?

743
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,040
Hey, were you enlightened?

744
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,360
Is that so hard to answer?

745
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,120
Enlightened...

746
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,520
Were you enlightened?

747
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,440
What do you mean?

748
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:01,040
♫ Waves upon waves ♫

749
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:05,760
♫ Miles of never-ending waves ♫

750
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,280
Nephew, you're back.

751
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:08,920
You're still awake at this hour?

752
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,720
What were you up to?

753
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,120
I was practising my Cantonese.

754
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,600
What's the matter?

755
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,120
What are you doing?

756
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,920
Didn't you tell me to copy it?

757
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:25,640
I'll check it tomorrow.

758
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,360
Fine with me.

759
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,320
Don't try to trick me.

760
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,600
Got it.

761
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,400
You're back.

762
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,960
Did you take alcohol?

763
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:00,640
Only a little.

764
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,160
I drank one cup
and severed my ties with them.

765
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,920
The liquor was excellent.

766
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,680
What a waste of fine liquor.

767
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,960
Who did you offend again?

768
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,120
Wait.

769
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,800
Who offended you again?

770
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,280
"Offend" isn't the right term for it.

771
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,000
It's called

772
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,040
fated to part ways.

773
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,560
I guess we're fated to part ways then.

774
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,240
I'm getting old.

775
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,080
I got drunk after drinking one cup.

776
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,440
I was spouting nonsense.

777
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,480
Did you see Tou Tou
when you came upstairs?

778
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,840
She's doing her homework.

779
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,680
She's not doing it.

780
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,200
Your son's doing it for her.

781
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,280
No wonder the room
next to ours is so quiet.

782
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,400
Tian Zhen never treated her
as an equal before.

783
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,080
Why is he trying to do
her homework for her now?

784
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,080
Your son is just trying
to atone for his mistakes.

785
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,360
However, he's still a good boy.

786
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,800
At least he knows his faults now.

787
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,240
I guess the phrase
"In wine, there is truth" is true.

788
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,520
You should drink more in the future.

789
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,600
Don't tell me you're going
to check it page by page?

790
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,400
Alright.

791
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,400
You're done with this month's task.

792
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,520
The drinking incident

793
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:41,960
is over now.

794
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,680
It was an accident.

795
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,240
I will never get drunk again.

796
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,760
I'm serious. I can hold my liquor well.

797
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,280
Alright.

798
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,120
You can proceed with it in the future.

799
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,440
You mean taking alcohol?

800
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,760
Writing.

801
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,640
What do you mean?

802
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,480
But why?

803
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,000
I thought you said
the incident was over?

804
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,120
Why do I still have to write?

805
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,120
This is your punishment.

806
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,520
After this, you'll be doing homework.

807
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,080
I can memorise them.

808
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,120
I can memorise their
medicinal properties,

809
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,000
the Pharmacopoeia, and everything else.

810
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,040
Can I not write them down?

811
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,600
Why must I write them down?

812
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,080
Why do you have so many questions?

813
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,960
Just write when I tell you to.

814
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,000
You'll understand why eventually.

815
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,320
I'm not willing to do it
without knowing what's going on.

816
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,120
That's just

817
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,840
a waste of time.

818
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,200
And,

819
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,280
you're not telling me

820
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,640
because you have no idea too.

821
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,120
Was it because

822
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,840
your master taught you
in the same manner?

823
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,800
Is that why you copy him blindly

824
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,680
and teach me in the same way?

825
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,440
Is this your so-called legacy?

826
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,840
And, do you think

827
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,920
that I need to learn everything
even if I don't understand them?

828
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,640
When I was young,

829
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,560
I did whatever my master told me to.

830
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,360
Unlike you. You ask questions

831
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,480
before you do it.

832
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,400
-You have so many questions.
-You're wrong.

833
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,440
Times have changed.

834
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,880
And, things are different now.

835
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,520
If you didn't study hard

836
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,360
or obey your master,
he would kick you out.

837
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,320
It's different for us.

838
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,160
You see,

839
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,600
you told me to study.

840
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,040
However, if you don't listen,

841
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:07,880
and if I don't study,

842
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,920
you'll have no successor.

843
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,880
Your master will definitely
reprimand you for that,

844
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,280
right?

845
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,000
Tou Tou,

846
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,560
you need to learn

847
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:22,760
how to find order in disorder.

848
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,240
What do you mean?

849
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:25,840
Learn slowly

850
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,840
and take it slow.

851
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,840
You'll be suddenly enlightened one day.

852
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,120
Your genes are amazing indeed.

853
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,480
You and your son speak
in the same manner.

854
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,560
When you can't explain something,

855
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,920
you'll use the term "enlightened".

856
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,600
It's like you're talking about
metaphysics.

857
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,520
Since you don't want to accept it,

858
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,000
I'll take back the reward then.

859
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,000
Reward...

860
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,680
Reward?

861
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,680
What reward?

862
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,320
Do you intend to reward me?

863
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,320
Why are you rewarding me?

864
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,000
I'm rewarding you
for keeping your promise.

865
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,120
I'm rewarding you

866
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,880
for complete this month's task.

867
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,920
I'm rewarding you

868
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:08,800
for brewing Meng Meng's medicine
successfully.

869
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,440
What will you reward me with?

870
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,960
Will we go to the claw machine arcade?

871
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,560
Is that it?

872
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,360
You'll know it by then.

873
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,360
How long is "by then"?

874
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,000
There's a reward?

875
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,200
If so, I'll wait here.

876
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,000
You can wait here.

877
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:39,840
Okay.

878
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,720
Are you leaving?

879
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,200
My reward!

880
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,040
Where's my reward?

881
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,320
My reward.

882
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,560
I waited the whole day.

883
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,600
Where's my reward?

884
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,000
What do you mean by this?

885
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,400
I'm rewarding you with a drink.

886
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,040
I'll teach you how to drink.

887
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,080
I don't need you to teach me that.

888
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,000
It's second nature to me.

889
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,400
For the word "Yi" in Chinese Medicine,
the bottom half

890
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,520
is the same as the bottom half of "Jiu",
which means alcohol.

891
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,640
That's not true.

892
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,720
That's true for
the traditional characters.

893
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,720
(Yi)

894
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:42,920
I know that.

895
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,880
It's written like this.

896
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,720
Like this.

897
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,200
So, alcohol

898
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,560
can be a form of medicine too.

899
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:48,880
When you take medicine,

900
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,600
you need to follow the nature
and seasons.

901
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,560
The best period for taking alcohol

902
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,680
should be the hour of You.

903
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,080
The hour of You?

904
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,120
It's from 5pm to 7pm.

905
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,000
Remember, it's the hour of You.

906
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,120
It's no wonder you started taking dinner

907
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,160
around 5pm.

908
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,520
When you take alcohol
during this period,

909
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,720
not only will it not harm your body,

910
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,760
but it also nourishes it.

911
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,640
The best period to take alcohol

912
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,560
is from 5pm to 7pm.

913
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,840
You need some pig ears and peanuts too.

914
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,000
That's how you get your nourishment.

915
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,760
Therefore, we must adapt what we do

916
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,360
to local conditions

917
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,840
and time.

918
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,600
Master,

919
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,680
I think

920
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,800
you have too many rules to follow.

921
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,760
That's so troublesome.

922
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,040
We should drink like this.

923
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:45,320
Bottoms up, every cup. That's the way.

924
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,280
Remember,

925
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,760
alcohol can benefit

926
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,120
and harm our bodies.

927
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:51,200
If you wish

928
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,840
to take alcohol even at an old age,

929
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,960
you have to follow these rules.

930
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:56,920
I know that.

931
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,880
I know.

932
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,360
We need to follow these rules.

933
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,600
When you know something,

934
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,480
you don't.

935
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,480
Cheers.

936
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,680
Excellent words.

937
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,640
Don't you think?

938
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,200
Take a small sip.

939
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,600
Don't finish it in one go.

940
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,240
Feel it.

941
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,080
Feel the scent

942
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,880
spreading

943
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,600
inside your mouth.

944
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,400
Try and track

945
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,400
the motion of the alcohol

946
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,040
entering your body.

947
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,720
Have you swallowed it?

948
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,040
Of course.

949
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,360
How could I not swallow it?

950
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,360
I had it in my mouth for so long.

951
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,240
How do you feel?

952
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,200
Indeed. This part feels pretty warm.

953
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,440
It feels warm.

954
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,120
There's a phrase

955
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,600
called Dutch courage.

956
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,000
When you take alcohol,

957
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,680
it reaches the Gallbladder Meridian
of Foot Shaoyang.

958
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,760
-Gallbladder Meridian.
-Until the bottom part.

959
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,600
-The bottom part.
-This part you mentioned.

960
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:56,880
Here.

961
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,000
That's the Yangming Meridian.

962
00:39:59,000 --> 00:39:59,920
Yangming Meridian.

963
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,320
That's why you feel warm.

964
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,280
You're very thoughtful.

965
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,880
You do live up to your name.

966
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,560
You know everything.

967
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,120
You're amazing.

968
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,000
Cheers.

969
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,160
What do you mean by that?

970
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,120
Pronounce it clearly.

971
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,360
I was saying that you were amazing.

972
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,520
Understood?

973
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,680
Master, listen.

974
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,840
Although you're treating me
to a drink today,

975
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,920
this is barely enough.

976
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,080
We need more.

977
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,480
According to
Compendium of Materia Medica,

978
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,520
taking excessive alcohol

979
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,880
will hurt the mind, waste the blood,

980
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,880
damage the stomach,
and dampen the spirit.

981
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,680
Take everything in moderation.

982
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,080
This is my reward for you.

983
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,040
-Here.
-Alright.

984
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,240
If so,

985
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,440
I'll take the entire pot.

986
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,880
I don't want to share it with you.

987
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,120
Just pour a little for me.

988
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:45,920
Take everything in moderation.

989
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:46,960
You said so yourself.

990
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,520
-Just a little more.
-Stop drinking.

991
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,040
-Just a little more.
-Stop drinking. Have some food.

992
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:51,920
Alright.

993
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,240
Your mouth is so oily.

994
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,320
Wipe your mouth.

995
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,840
Stop drinking.

996
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,400
Wait. What are you doing?

997
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,480
Hey.

998
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:01,640
There's not much left.

999
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,080
Just a little.

1000
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,680
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

1001
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,000

traditional Chinese medicine books)
