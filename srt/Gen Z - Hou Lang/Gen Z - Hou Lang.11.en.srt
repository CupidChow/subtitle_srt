1
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,868
(Gen Z)

2
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,040
(Episode 11)

3
00:01:39,093 --> 00:01:41,414
It's common for children to catch a cold

4
00:01:41,653 --> 00:01:42,734
or have a fever.

5
00:01:42,734 --> 00:01:44,453
We TCM practitioners have been
studying this topic

6
00:01:44,453 --> 00:01:45,894
for millenniums.

7
00:01:46,574 --> 00:01:47,654
Let me recommend someone to you.

8
00:01:48,654 --> 00:01:50,053
What about the son
of Professor Ren, Tian Zhen?

9
00:01:50,293 --> 00:01:51,574
He studied TCM since young.

10
00:01:51,814 --> 00:01:53,414
Diagnosing minor illnesses as such

11
00:01:53,414 --> 00:01:54,654
is second nature to him.

12
00:01:54,654 --> 00:01:55,453
And, he's good at

13
00:01:55,453 --> 00:01:57,334
both TCM Acupuncture

14
00:01:57,453 --> 00:01:58,814
and brewing medicine.

15
00:01:59,094 --> 00:02:00,693
Mr Zheng, you don't
need to worry at all.

16
00:02:04,494 --> 00:02:05,389
Mr Ren,

17
00:02:05,414 --> 00:02:06,213
I'm a paediatrician.

18
00:02:06,213 --> 00:02:07,016
I should go.

19
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:08,854
This is the territory of
TCM practitioners.

20
00:02:08,854 --> 00:02:09,854
You can stay here.

21
00:02:10,174 --> 00:02:11,334
But when it comes to sick children...

22
00:02:17,133 --> 00:02:18,694
Mr Ren, I'll go.

23
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,080
Li Quan will do.

24
00:02:21,214 --> 00:02:22,573
He and Tian Zhen are classmates.

25
00:02:22,733 --> 00:02:24,214
Both of them are
Professor Ren's students.

26
00:02:24,374 --> 00:02:25,893
We can assess their result.

27
00:02:26,453 --> 00:02:27,253
Yes.

28
00:02:27,453 --> 00:02:29,054
Professor Ren, Mr Wu,

29
00:02:29,093 --> 00:02:30,494
I do acknowledge

30
00:02:30,494 --> 00:02:31,814
their academic qualifications.

31
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,534
However, I was only given
this daughter in my old age.

32
00:02:35,453 --> 00:02:36,733
She was spoiled since young.

33
00:02:36,733 --> 00:02:38,453
Her body is weak.

34
00:02:38,453 --> 00:02:40,213
Having a fever might be a minor illness.

35
00:02:40,213 --> 00:02:41,414
But she contracted pneumonia

36
00:02:41,414 --> 00:02:42,454
and got a hormone shot

37
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:43,533
for a fever last year.

38
00:02:43,533 --> 00:02:45,293
Although it didn't develop into asthma,

39
00:02:45,293 --> 00:02:46,134
she still

40
00:02:46,134 --> 00:02:48,054
wheezes from time to time.

41
00:02:48,454 --> 00:02:50,134
Professor Ren,

42
00:02:50,213 --> 00:02:51,014
please give her a diagnosis.

43
00:02:51,014 --> 00:02:52,293
Look at how anxious he is.

44
00:02:53,533 --> 00:02:54,361
You see.

45
00:02:54,933 --> 00:02:56,654
-It'll be fine.
-Uncle.

46
00:02:57,334 --> 00:02:58,893
I wish to send Tou Tou there.

47
00:03:00,454 --> 00:03:01,573
Tou Tou?

48
00:03:01,573 --> 00:03:03,493
She only started studying
TCM not long ago.

49
00:03:03,493 --> 00:03:05,293
You should send Li Quan and Tian Zhen.

50
00:03:05,493 --> 00:03:06,654
Don't be careless.

51
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:09,654
Mr Zheng, let me tell you this.

52
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:11,893
This junior of mine

53
00:03:13,213 --> 00:03:15,654
is the successor of
the Jiang family's acupuncture sect.

54
00:03:17,054 --> 00:03:18,293
She's the bloodline.

55
00:03:21,054 --> 00:03:21,978
Junior,

56
00:03:22,853 --> 00:03:23,718
you should go there.

57
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:26,414
This is inappropriate.

58
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:27,813
How could we trouble

59
00:03:27,813 --> 00:03:29,054
the successor with such a minor matter?

60
00:03:29,054 --> 00:03:29,908
Look.

61
00:03:29,933 --> 00:03:32,213
He still doesn't believe
in the successor.

62
00:03:33,134 --> 00:03:34,293
So, you're afraid that
you'll trouble her.

63
00:03:34,694 --> 00:03:35,654
What about me?

64
00:03:36,853 --> 00:03:37,677
That's right.

65
00:03:37,853 --> 00:03:39,374
We're friends for many years.

66
00:03:39,654 --> 00:03:40,654
I'll join her.

67
00:03:53,694 --> 00:03:54,511
Mr Ren,

68
00:03:55,854 --> 00:03:56,974
are you sure you want her to do it?

69
00:03:59,494 --> 00:04:00,319
Wait.

70
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:01,934
My daughter is afraid of needles.

71
00:04:01,934 --> 00:04:04,013
It's hard to keep her under control
when she starts crying.

72
00:04:06,774 --> 00:04:07,574
Can she take medicinal brew then?

73
00:04:08,694 --> 00:04:09,813
No.

74
00:04:10,134 --> 00:04:11,694
We let her try it when she was little.

75
00:04:11,694 --> 00:04:12,813
She couldn't take it.

76
00:04:13,214 --> 00:04:14,893
There's no need for
any medicine or needles.

77
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:20,294
Where's your kitchen?

78
00:04:21,054 --> 00:04:21,893
Kitchen?

79
00:04:33,294 --> 00:04:34,220
You put that much?

80
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:14,960
Done.

81
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,880
This is it?

82
00:05:17,134 --> 00:05:18,013
Kitchen cures everything.

83
00:05:18,013 --> 00:05:18,854
Take it to her.

84
00:05:18,854 --> 00:05:19,691
Tell her to take it while it's hot.

85
00:05:45,974 --> 00:05:47,093
Tou Tou, what are you doing?

86
00:05:48,253 --> 00:05:49,294
I'm making egg yolk oil.

87
00:05:49,574 --> 00:05:50,974
Egg yolk oil doesn't cure
the common cold.

88
00:05:51,134 --> 00:05:52,041
I know.

89
00:05:54,373 --> 00:05:55,414
Stop messing around.

90
00:05:55,414 --> 00:05:56,253
I'm not.

91
00:05:56,253 --> 00:05:57,493
Wait outside.

92
00:06:01,813 --> 00:06:02,712
Done.

93
00:06:08,574 --> 00:06:09,457
You're done?

94
00:06:10,773 --> 00:06:11,657
Let's go.

95
00:06:17,933 --> 00:06:18,974
She finished the soup, right?

96
00:06:19,974 --> 00:06:21,053
Yes, but...

97
00:06:24,093 --> 00:06:25,053
What do you mean?

98
00:06:25,053 --> 00:06:25,854
What happened after that?

99
00:06:26,694 --> 00:06:27,493
Tang Tang said

100
00:06:27,493 --> 00:06:28,933
it tasted like instant noodles'
soup base.

101
00:06:29,373 --> 00:06:30,493
Will this work?

102
00:06:30,574 --> 00:06:32,213
That's not the soup base
of instant noodles.

103
00:06:32,773 --> 00:06:34,213
That's Sun Tou Tou's

104
00:06:34,533 --> 00:06:35,854
unique fever medicine.

105
00:06:36,574 --> 00:06:37,933
It just tastes similar.

106
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:39,694
You see.

107
00:06:43,574 --> 00:06:44,414
She's sweating.

108
00:06:45,933 --> 00:06:48,134
This should be what the book
meant by "perspire".

109
00:06:49,373 --> 00:06:50,229
Tou Tou.

110
00:06:57,253 --> 00:06:58,414
I saw something just now.

111
00:06:59,373 --> 00:07:00,493
There's a scratch wound here.

112
00:07:00,493 --> 00:07:01,653
What's going on?

113
00:07:02,093 --> 00:07:03,053
I don't know.

114
00:07:03,533 --> 00:07:06,213
Ever since she was stung by
bugs in Hainan four months ago,

115
00:07:06,653 --> 00:07:07,974
she had rashes.

116
00:07:08,253 --> 00:07:09,373
The more she scratched it,
the bigger it grew.

117
00:07:09,773 --> 00:07:10,974
It's also filled with pus.

118
00:07:11,213 --> 00:07:12,734
Once a scab is formed,
it'll crack again.

119
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,813
She suffered because of it.

120
00:07:15,653 --> 00:07:16,813
She's still like this

121
00:07:17,253 --> 00:07:18,253
even after applying all kinds
of ointments and medicine.

122
00:07:18,854 --> 00:07:20,694
If so, you can put this oil

123
00:07:21,053 --> 00:07:22,294
in a bottle.

124
00:07:22,614 --> 00:07:23,454
You can rub it on her skin

125
00:07:23,454 --> 00:07:24,813
every day.

126
00:07:25,373 --> 00:07:27,093
It'll take around three to five days.

127
00:07:27,253 --> 00:07:29,561
She should recover as long as
she doesn't scratch them again.

128
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:30,894
She won't be itchy after applying it.

129
00:07:30,894 --> 00:07:32,134
What kind of oil is this?

130
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:34,093
-I'll leave it here.
-This is the egg...

131
00:07:38,253 --> 00:07:39,454
You don't even remember the name?

132
00:07:41,134 --> 00:07:43,294
This is Shendan Oil,

133
00:07:43,773 --> 00:07:44,676
which Master treasures a lot.

134
00:07:45,373 --> 00:07:46,773
What are you saying?

135
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:47,773
You don't even remember the name.

136
00:07:47,773 --> 00:07:49,253
Shendan Oil is very precious.

137
00:07:49,694 --> 00:07:52,533
It doesn't contain any
chemicals or additives.

138
00:07:53,253 --> 00:07:55,174
It's child-friendly.

139
00:07:55,653 --> 00:07:56,493
And, it's very precious.

140
00:07:57,253 --> 00:07:58,134
It's used

141
00:07:58,134 --> 00:08:00,253
to treat all kinds of rashes.

142
00:08:01,093 --> 00:08:03,014
Judging from Tang Tang's condition,

143
00:08:03,533 --> 00:08:04,653
her fever should subside

144
00:08:05,014 --> 00:08:05,813
in half an hour.

145
00:08:05,974 --> 00:08:06,933
Don't be too worried.

146
00:08:07,533 --> 00:08:08,854
-Thank you.
-Don't mention it.

147
00:08:09,093 --> 00:08:10,493
If her fever doesn't subside
in half an hour,

148
00:08:10,773 --> 00:08:12,974
I'll look for your master.

149
00:08:12,974 --> 00:08:14,014
That's impossible...

150
00:08:15,533 --> 00:08:16,424
Alright.

151
00:08:25,574 --> 00:08:27,614
You didn't utter a single word of truth.

152
00:08:27,813 --> 00:08:28,813
The ordinary egg yolk oil

153
00:08:28,813 --> 00:08:31,053
became Master's precious Shendan Oil
when you describe it.

154
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:35,373
If she knows that the oil is cheap,

155
00:08:35,373 --> 00:08:36,294
easy to obtain,

156
00:08:36,414 --> 00:08:37,454
and made by me,

157
00:08:37,454 --> 00:08:38,653
do you think she'll use it?

158
00:08:39,933 --> 00:08:40,974
Look at how huge her house is.

159
00:08:42,093 --> 00:08:43,174
Will she believe me?

160
00:08:43,174 --> 00:08:44,093
Tell me.

161
00:08:48,093 --> 00:08:50,093
You read Tang Tang's pulse, right?
How was it?

162
00:08:51,093 --> 00:08:52,253
She's fine. It's not a huge issue.

163
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:54,373
Good.

164
00:08:54,373 --> 00:08:56,093
How did you know that
Tang Tang has eczema?

165
00:09:11,373 --> 00:09:12,373
I read her pulse.

166
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:14,734
You're full of nonsense, aren't you?

167
00:09:15,134 --> 00:09:16,373
I'll call you Master if you can

168
00:09:16,373 --> 00:09:17,493
diagnose that by reading pulse.

169
00:09:17,493 --> 00:09:18,533
Good grandson.

170
00:09:29,134 --> 00:09:30,333
Why don't I check it out?

171
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:31,253
You want to go there?

172
00:09:32,134 --> 00:09:33,174
It'll be too late by then.

173
00:09:35,694 --> 00:09:37,053
I'm joking.

174
00:09:37,053 --> 00:09:38,134
I meant,

175
00:09:38,454 --> 00:09:39,694
it'd be too late for
Shan Dao to go there

176
00:09:39,894 --> 00:09:41,813
as the child would've recovered by then.

177
00:09:42,929 --> 00:09:43,779
Senior,

178
00:09:43,813 --> 00:09:45,694
when it comes to giving a diagnosis,

179
00:09:45,694 --> 00:09:47,734
we're equals.

180
00:09:47,734 --> 00:09:48,614
But when it comes to bragging,

181
00:09:49,053 --> 00:09:50,253
I'm no match for you.

182
00:09:50,373 --> 00:09:51,253
That's why

183
00:09:51,454 --> 00:09:54,014
my reputation in the industry

184
00:09:54,933 --> 00:09:56,454
is a little worse than yours.

185
00:09:56,493 --> 00:09:58,734
It's all because I can't brag.

186
00:10:02,694 --> 00:10:03,574
Junior.

187
00:10:04,253 --> 00:10:05,134
How did it go?

188
00:10:06,253 --> 00:10:07,333
Senior, there's no need to worry.

189
00:10:12,133 --> 00:10:12,985
Tou,

190
00:10:13,902 --> 00:10:14,724
you're something else.

191
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:15,814
You actually cured her

192
00:10:15,814 --> 00:10:16,773
of her complicated ailments.

193
00:10:17,374 --> 00:10:18,614
Tang Tang is awake.
Her fever has subsided.

194
00:10:18,614 --> 00:10:19,974
She said she wanted some fried chicken.

195
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:21,494
Don't give her that.

196
00:10:22,573 --> 00:10:23,414
Her fever will come back.

197
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:24,333
Her fever usually lasts

198
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:25,893
for one week.

199
00:10:26,133 --> 00:10:27,076
What about this?

200
00:10:27,374 --> 00:10:28,814
Make some porridge for her.

201
00:10:28,814 --> 00:10:29,814
Make it

202
00:10:30,013 --> 00:10:31,054
with rice bran oil.

203
00:10:31,254 --> 00:10:32,333
That can warm her stomach.

204
00:10:34,254 --> 00:10:35,205
Tou Tou,

205
00:10:36,133 --> 00:10:37,573
what medicine did you give
the child just now?

206
00:10:38,133 --> 00:10:38,934
Hot pot soup.

207
00:10:40,693 --> 00:10:41,573
Hot pot soup?

208
00:10:42,254 --> 00:10:43,134
Good job.

209
00:10:43,453 --> 00:10:44,814
The successor of
the Jiang family's acupuncture sect

210
00:10:44,814 --> 00:10:45,814
is excellent indeed.

211
00:10:45,814 --> 00:10:46,734
She has mastered

212
00:10:46,734 --> 00:10:48,254
the Treatise On Febrile Diseases
Caused By Cold.

213
00:10:48,573 --> 00:10:49,494
Mr Zheng,

214
00:10:49,494 --> 00:10:50,494
you don't need to worry at all.

215
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:51,934
With her skills,

216
00:10:52,174 --> 00:10:53,082
your daughter

217
00:10:53,573 --> 00:10:54,441
will be fine.

218
00:10:56,693 --> 00:10:57,642
You see,

219
00:10:59,133 --> 00:11:00,573
fever on children
usually lasts for one week.

220
00:11:00,773 --> 00:11:01,814
Usually,

221
00:11:01,814 --> 00:11:02,893
they'll perspire

222
00:11:03,174 --> 00:11:04,254
after taking fever medicine.

223
00:11:05,174 --> 00:11:06,254
Although it relieves her condition
on the surface,

224
00:11:06,693 --> 00:11:07,644
it also

225
00:11:08,054 --> 00:11:09,133
affects her health.

226
00:11:09,374 --> 00:11:10,213
When her body is weak,

227
00:11:10,494 --> 00:11:12,374
pathogen will attack her body.

228
00:11:12,693 --> 00:11:13,626
After your daughter

229
00:11:13,814 --> 00:11:15,333
consumed the hot pot soup

230
00:11:15,573 --> 00:11:16,374
made by her,

231
00:11:17,054 --> 00:11:18,213
her body will grow strong.

232
00:11:19,013 --> 00:11:20,133
She'll be fine within a few days.

233
00:11:22,693 --> 00:11:23,535
Xin Zheng,

234
00:11:25,133 --> 00:11:26,614
you did great in teaching your student.

235
00:11:30,494 --> 00:11:31,333
Don't get too full of yourself.

236
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:32,573
This is only your first patient.

237
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:33,693
I'm not full at all.

238
00:11:34,614 --> 00:11:35,573
I just think

239
00:11:37,174 --> 00:11:38,254
that your father didn't deceive me.

240
00:11:38,453 --> 00:11:40,133
Saving real kids

241
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:42,174
is much more fun than
playing with claw machines.

242
00:11:43,054 --> 00:11:43,923
There's a delicate feeling

243
00:11:44,398 --> 00:11:45,510
that I cannot describe.

244
00:11:49,254 --> 00:11:50,118
What do you think?

245
00:11:50,934 --> 00:11:51,854
You win again.

246
00:12:00,494 --> 00:12:02,469
Professor Ren, thank you so much.

247
00:12:02,934 --> 00:12:04,133
Your Shendan Oil

248
00:12:04,453 --> 00:12:05,573
worked miraculously.

249
00:12:06,573 --> 00:12:07,814
You're an expert
in the TCM industry indeed.

250
00:12:08,054 --> 00:12:10,213
However, where can we get

251
00:12:10,254 --> 00:12:11,374
such precious commodity

252
00:12:11,414 --> 00:12:12,573
when we need it in the future?

253
00:12:16,494 --> 00:12:18,494
-Do you still feel itchy?
-No.

254
00:12:18,573 --> 00:12:19,573
You don't feel itchy now?

255
00:12:21,453 --> 00:12:23,013
Actually, this oil

256
00:12:24,254 --> 00:12:25,133
cannot be found anywhere.

257
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:26,814
What about this?
I'll bring it for your child

258
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:28,814
when I visit you guys next time
if she needs it.

259
00:12:28,934 --> 00:12:30,133
Thank you in advance then.

260
00:12:30,133 --> 00:12:31,108
Don't mention it.

261
00:12:31,133 --> 00:12:32,453
Remember to rest well.

262
00:12:33,573 --> 00:12:35,054
-Goodbye.
-Say goodbye.

263
00:12:35,174 --> 00:12:36,093
Thank the miss

264
00:12:36,093 --> 00:12:37,254
and the mister.

265
00:12:46,374 --> 00:12:47,305
What?

266
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:48,734
What oil did you give her?

267
00:12:49,573 --> 00:12:50,533
Egg yolk oil.

268
00:12:52,614 --> 00:12:54,093
You taught this in class.

269
00:12:54,693 --> 00:12:57,054
You quoted a saying from Li Shi Zhen.

270
00:12:57,054 --> 00:12:59,814
Egg yolk oil is excellent
for itching skin, rashes

271
00:13:00,814 --> 00:13:02,054
with wound.

272
00:13:04,414 --> 00:13:05,573
You're promising indeed.

273
00:13:06,734 --> 00:13:07,814
We studied together.

274
00:13:07,814 --> 00:13:09,294
Why didn't I think of that?

275
00:13:10,174 --> 00:13:11,294
You're good at learning

276
00:13:12,054 --> 00:13:13,054
while Tou Tou is good at implementing.

277
00:13:13,054 --> 00:13:14,213
I have a pretty good memory.

278
00:13:14,374 --> 00:13:15,693
I'm putting what I learned to practice.

279
00:13:16,013 --> 00:13:17,693
You see, Chinese culture

280
00:13:17,693 --> 00:13:19,133
is all about putting
what you learned to practice.

281
00:13:19,814 --> 00:13:22,494
But Western culture,

282
00:13:22,693 --> 00:13:24,934
they focus on learning
for the sake of learning.

283
00:13:25,693 --> 00:13:27,133
You see, we can't say

284
00:13:27,614 --> 00:13:29,174
that some knowledge is useless.

285
00:13:29,814 --> 00:13:30,934
But we learn some of them

286
00:13:31,254 --> 00:13:32,333
just to make us happy.

287
00:13:37,966 --> 00:13:38,820
Mr Zheng,

288
00:13:39,374 --> 00:13:40,333
please don't see us off.

289
00:13:40,494 --> 00:13:41,494
This is far enough.

290
00:13:41,693 --> 00:13:43,453
Fellow Zhang, we prepared
some gifts for you.

291
00:13:43,453 --> 00:13:44,374
This is Pu'er tea.

292
00:13:44,374 --> 00:13:45,573
This is a five-year
Ambrosia artemisiifolia.

293
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:48,693
Mr Zheng, your gifts

294
00:13:48,693 --> 00:13:50,213
are extremely precious.

295
00:13:51,573 --> 00:13:52,934
However, a person like me

296
00:13:53,494 --> 00:13:54,934
takes delight in experiencing nature.

297
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:57,174
I'm afraid such valuable gifts
are a waste if you give them to me.

298
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,616
Alright then.

299
00:13:59,814 --> 00:14:01,494
I'll present these gifts

300
00:14:01,893 --> 00:14:03,054
to my junior.

301
00:14:04,934 --> 00:14:05,739
Tou Tou.

302
00:14:11,573 --> 00:14:12,443
Tou Tou.

303
00:14:13,885 --> 00:14:14,738
Take them.

304
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:16,734
I'm giving you his gifts.

305
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,560
-Thank you.
-Alright.

306
00:14:22,374 --> 00:14:23,653
However, I'm sincere
in giving them to you.

307
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:28,374
After meeting Junior,

308
00:14:29,013 --> 00:14:31,054
I finally understood the phrase
"born with knowledge".

309
00:14:32,814 --> 00:14:34,174
You must study hard under your master.

310
00:14:37,054 --> 00:14:38,573
Chinese civilization
is deep and complex.

311
00:14:38,934 --> 00:14:40,533
We have to depend on
youngsters like you all

312
00:14:41,054 --> 00:14:42,133
to carry forward the culture.

313
00:14:44,453 --> 00:14:45,494
Alright, I'll make a move now.

314
00:14:45,934 --> 00:14:47,693
-See you.
-Okay.

315
00:14:47,693 --> 00:14:49,174
-Goodbye, Great-uncle.
-Goodbye, Uncle.

316
00:15:00,254 --> 00:15:01,734
-Take it.
-A five-year Ambrosia artemisiifolia?

317
00:15:02,893 --> 00:15:03,814
That's precious.

318
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,577
(Minor Heat, signifying
high temperature.)

319
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,161
(It's not the hottest period yet.)

320
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,140
(New grains will be ready for harvest
in the South after Minor Heat.)

321
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,469
(The North has a habit of having
dumplings during this period.)

322
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,661
(Minor Heat)

323
00:15:33,981 --> 00:15:35,981
(Abundant throughout The Seasons)

324
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,463
(Qibo Medical Centre)

325
00:15:37,573 --> 00:15:38,488
Professor Ren,

326
00:15:38,573 --> 00:15:40,374
I have to express my gratitude.

327
00:15:41,814 --> 00:15:44,133
I benefited a lot

328
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:45,893
from your class.

329
00:15:45,893 --> 00:15:47,453
I was suddenly enlightened.

330
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:49,494
It worked better than taking medicine.

331
00:15:49,494 --> 00:15:51,693
Tell me then. How were you enlightened?

332
00:15:52,254 --> 00:15:53,224
I got a divorce.

333
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:57,374
I didn't tell you
to get a divorce, right?

334
00:15:58,734 --> 00:16:00,414
Yes, you didn't tell me to do so.

335
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:02,614
However, during your class, you said

336
00:16:02,814 --> 00:16:04,374
we should discard

337
00:16:04,573 --> 00:16:05,814
everything

338
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:07,573
that causes us

339
00:16:07,573 --> 00:16:08,533
to have negative emotions

340
00:16:08,533 --> 00:16:09,934
and throw them away.

341
00:16:10,054 --> 00:16:11,734
Only then will there be enough space

342
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:14,254
for positive emotions to be generated

343
00:16:14,254 --> 00:16:15,333
and return to our bodies.

344
00:16:15,453 --> 00:16:16,934
That's right.

345
00:16:17,254 --> 00:16:18,893
There's an old saying.

346
00:16:19,374 --> 00:16:20,494
Marriage should be protected

347
00:16:20,934 --> 00:16:22,213
at all costs.

348
00:16:22,494 --> 00:16:24,254
I have to be held accountable
for this now.

349
00:16:24,533 --> 00:16:25,333
That's not it.

350
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:26,374
Not at all.

351
00:16:26,374 --> 00:16:27,653
It has nothing to do with you.

352
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,133
You did a great deed.

353
00:16:29,693 --> 00:16:31,614
I benefited a lot

354
00:16:31,814 --> 00:16:32,934
from your class.

355
00:16:33,133 --> 00:16:34,076
Now,

356
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:36,494
I've gotten over them.

357
00:16:36,934 --> 00:16:38,333
I discovered an issue.

358
00:16:38,814 --> 00:16:41,374
What I desire in the past
is completely opposite

359
00:16:41,693 --> 00:16:43,294
from what I desire

360
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:44,183
right now.

361
00:16:44,693 --> 00:16:46,054
If I insist on keeping them,

362
00:16:46,374 --> 00:16:47,814
that will make me selfish.

363
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:49,254
If so,

364
00:16:50,133 --> 00:16:51,814
what do you desire?

365
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,374
Back then, I wanted someone
who didn't love me

366
00:16:55,374 --> 00:16:56,734
to fall for me.

367
00:16:59,254 --> 00:17:00,133
But now,

368
00:17:00,494 --> 00:17:01,734
all those thoughts have disappeared.

369
00:17:03,614 --> 00:17:04,570
Professor Ren,

370
00:17:04,814 --> 00:17:05,614
wouldn't it be great

371
00:17:05,773 --> 00:17:07,414
if you turned it into an online lesson?

372
00:17:08,814 --> 00:17:10,013
Although

373
00:17:10,013 --> 00:17:11,254
you were holding that class

374
00:17:11,254 --> 00:17:12,614
for your TCM students,

375
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:14,254
people like me

376
00:17:14,494 --> 00:17:15,494
with zero knowledge

377
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:17,453
actually benefited a lot

378
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:18,453
from a single class.

379
00:17:19,054 --> 00:17:20,814
I'm sure a lot of people would
benefit from this greatly

380
00:17:21,054 --> 00:17:22,414
if we put it online.

381
00:17:24,693 --> 00:17:25,814
We can use your medical centre

382
00:17:26,013 --> 00:17:28,254
to turn you

383
00:17:28,494 --> 00:17:30,573
into a popular female influencer.

384
00:17:33,054 --> 00:17:33,941
That's difficult.

385
00:17:34,573 --> 00:17:35,414
Not at all.

386
00:17:35,693 --> 00:17:36,587
It's very difficult.

387
00:17:37,693 --> 00:17:38,614
You see,

388
00:17:38,734 --> 00:17:40,734
I'm a man after all.

389
00:17:42,054 --> 00:17:42,934
You're right.

390
00:18:04,734 --> 00:18:05,650
Look.

391
00:18:08,614 --> 00:18:09,693
The kids

392
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:11,213
are getting along well.

393
00:18:11,854 --> 00:18:12,653
Children

394
00:18:12,653 --> 00:18:14,494
should spend time with each other

395
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:15,294
to grow well.

396
00:18:16,614 --> 00:18:17,734
Jian Xi

397
00:18:17,854 --> 00:18:19,614
has been in a good mood lately.

398
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,814
She wants me to bring her here

399
00:18:21,974 --> 00:18:22,814
whenever she wakes up.

400
00:18:22,814 --> 00:18:24,254
This snack is delicious.

401
00:18:24,254 --> 00:18:25,734
-It has fillings?
-Yeah.

402
00:18:25,734 --> 00:18:27,133
The physicians here

403
00:18:27,133 --> 00:18:28,093
are very friendly too.

404
00:18:28,093 --> 00:18:30,133
-Try it.
-They're nice to us.

405
00:18:30,614 --> 00:18:31,814
Look.

406
00:18:31,814 --> 00:18:33,013
We also have Meng Meng,
who's almost the same age as her

407
00:18:33,013 --> 00:18:34,068
to keep her company.

408
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:36,734
When I look at them,

409
00:18:36,934 --> 00:18:38,653
I feel as if everything
has gotten better.

410
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:41,933
I wish to apply for leave next week.

411
00:18:42,614 --> 00:18:43,523
Do you have something to do?

412
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:45,629
It's all thanks to Professor Ren.

413
00:18:45,813 --> 00:18:46,854
He shared my post

414
00:18:46,854 --> 00:18:48,173
I made to look for tiles.

415
00:18:48,734 --> 00:18:50,213
Many people viewed it.

416
00:18:50,213 --> 00:18:51,413
I received two DMs.

417
00:18:51,774 --> 00:18:52,693
The information was pretty complete.

418
00:18:52,974 --> 00:18:53,974
I wish to look for them.

419
00:18:54,656 --> 00:18:55,695
Alright.

420
00:18:56,213 --> 00:18:57,933
I hope you can find them this time.

421
00:18:58,784 --> 00:18:59,709
Don't worry.

422
00:18:59,734 --> 00:19:00,854
I won't give up

423
00:19:00,854 --> 00:19:02,053
even if I don't find them this time.

424
00:19:02,494 --> 00:19:03,854
Maybe I'll find them next time.

425
00:19:04,071 --> 00:19:05,156
Yeah.

426
00:19:05,614 --> 00:19:07,413
Nothing is impossible.

427
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,093
When there's a will, there's a way.

428
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:10,282
That's right.

429
00:19:11,856 --> 00:19:12,879
So,

430
00:19:13,693 --> 00:19:14,734
how long will you be away?

431
00:19:14,933 --> 00:19:16,693
The place is pretty far away.

432
00:19:17,053 --> 00:19:17,894
It's out of the province.

433
00:19:18,453 --> 00:19:20,494
I will be away for at least one week.

434
00:19:23,813 --> 00:19:24,854
What about Jian Xi then?

435
00:19:25,573 --> 00:19:27,134
That's what I'm fretting about.

436
00:19:31,318 --> 00:19:32,243
So,

437
00:19:33,254 --> 00:19:34,142
why don't you

438
00:19:35,213 --> 00:19:37,053
let Jian Xi live with us?

439
00:19:37,053 --> 00:19:38,254
I can take care of her.

440
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:40,894
Xia,

441
00:19:41,254 --> 00:19:42,413
you can let Jian Xi live with us

442
00:19:42,693 --> 00:19:44,134
while you look for the tiles.

443
00:19:44,614 --> 00:19:45,974
I'll send her here

444
00:19:46,134 --> 00:19:47,374
every morning.

445
00:19:47,614 --> 00:19:49,213
I'll pick her up and bring her home
every evening.

446
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:50,213
What do you think?

447
00:19:50,974 --> 00:19:51,854
Don't worry.

448
00:19:52,734 --> 00:19:53,974
How could I not worry?

449
00:19:54,254 --> 00:19:55,974
You might suffer a relapse
at any given time.

450
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:57,494
What if you go berserk

451
00:19:57,494 --> 00:19:58,654
and do something crazy again?

452
00:19:59,053 --> 00:20:01,134
Jian Xi is in this state because of you.

453
00:20:01,453 --> 00:20:02,293
I can't entrust her to your care.

454
00:20:03,573 --> 00:20:04,974
I've already gotten a divorce.

455
00:20:05,374 --> 00:20:07,254
I've already discarded
my negative emotions.

456
00:20:08,213 --> 00:20:10,654
I plan to start a new life.

457
00:20:11,093 --> 00:20:12,974
Jian Xi is in this state because of me.

458
00:20:13,453 --> 00:20:14,974
I'll surely take responsibility for it.

459
00:20:16,254 --> 00:20:17,614
Here's a bank card.

460
00:20:18,254 --> 00:20:19,213
Inside it,

461
00:20:19,734 --> 00:20:20,654
there's a sum

462
00:20:20,894 --> 00:20:22,854
I received after getting a divorce.

463
00:20:23,254 --> 00:20:24,213
I didn't use a single cent.

464
00:20:24,453 --> 00:20:25,333
You can have all of it.

465
00:20:25,854 --> 00:20:27,413
Use it to treat Jian Xi's condition.

466
00:20:28,254 --> 00:20:29,734
What about you and your son then?

467
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:31,774
I'm still around.

468
00:20:32,614 --> 00:20:34,413
I can provide for him when I work.

469
00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:36,614
You need the money more than me.

470
00:20:36,831 --> 00:20:37,692
Just take it.

471
00:20:41,478 --> 00:20:42,356
Zhu Xia.

472
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,051
Just take it.

473
00:20:46,086 --> 00:20:46,946
You can entrust

474
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,519
Jian Xi to her too.

475
00:20:49,774 --> 00:20:52,413
This way, you can proceed with
your mission without any worries.

476
00:20:54,511 --> 00:20:55,504
Yeah.

477
00:20:56,614 --> 00:20:58,213
Xia, may you achieve success.

478
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:01,894
We need to brew medicine
for Jian Xi every day, right?

479
00:21:02,053 --> 00:21:02,894
Great.

480
00:21:03,374 --> 00:21:04,453
I need to brew medicine for myself too.

481
00:21:04,974 --> 00:21:06,049
I'll brew hers as well.

482
00:21:06,494 --> 00:21:07,374
What do you think?

483
00:21:27,413 --> 00:21:28,365
Tou Tou,

484
00:21:30,053 --> 00:21:32,494
you'd better not make things
explode again.

485
00:21:32,534 --> 00:21:34,734
I know. Don't worry. This time,

486
00:21:34,894 --> 00:21:36,573
I won't drink or sleep.

487
00:21:36,734 --> 00:21:38,453
I promise I'll finish brewing
Meng Meng's medicine.

488
00:21:41,053 --> 00:21:41,927
By the way,

489
00:21:42,093 --> 00:21:43,974
have you finished copying
Virtue of A Great Physician?

490
00:21:45,014 --> 00:21:46,333
You'd better complete it by this month.

491
00:21:46,374 --> 00:21:48,093
Your master will check it tomorrow.

492
00:21:50,693 --> 00:21:51,517
Wait.

493
00:21:51,974 --> 00:21:52,813
He'll check it?

494
00:21:53,254 --> 00:21:54,093
What do you mean by that?

495
00:21:54,654 --> 00:21:55,497
Why does he need

496
00:21:55,573 --> 00:21:56,693
to check it after I'm done copying it?

497
00:21:57,614 --> 00:21:59,573
It'll only be considered a homework
if an assessment is made.

498
00:22:03,213 --> 00:22:04,220
Wait.

499
00:22:05,494 --> 00:22:06,734
That's...

500
00:22:07,093 --> 00:22:08,293
-I copied it but...
-What?

501
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:09,725
Did you not copy it?

502
00:22:10,933 --> 00:22:11,839
I...

503
00:22:11,894 --> 00:22:12,745
She did copy it.

504
00:22:12,974 --> 00:22:14,413
But she threw them everywhere.

505
00:22:14,453 --> 00:22:15,413
I'm sure she can't find them now.

506
00:22:18,053 --> 00:22:19,293
How did you know?

507
00:22:29,173 --> 00:22:30,041
Save me.

508
00:22:32,093 --> 00:22:33,134
Niece-in-law, save me.

509
00:22:33,134 --> 00:22:34,974
Tian Zhen, what did you say just now?

510
00:22:35,693 --> 00:22:36,894
Niece-in-law, save me!

511
00:22:37,053 --> 00:22:37,974
Tian Zhen, what did you say just now?

512
00:22:37,974 --> 00:22:39,333
Save me!

513
00:22:39,693 --> 00:22:40,624
Save me.

514
00:22:41,053 --> 00:22:41,896
The medicine!

515
00:22:42,573 --> 00:22:43,813
Save me!

516
00:22:56,014 --> 00:22:57,573
Professor Ren, you have a noble vision.

517
00:22:58,173 --> 00:22:59,068
Don't worry.

518
00:22:59,093 --> 00:23:01,534
We're your sidekicks.

519
00:23:02,077 --> 00:23:02,917
That's right.

520
00:23:03,053 --> 00:23:05,213
We'll definitely assist you

521
00:23:05,573 --> 00:23:06,774
in achieving your goal.

522
00:23:08,333 --> 00:23:10,134
Our nation has introduced many policies

523
00:23:10,293 --> 00:23:11,933
to develop the TCM industry.

524
00:23:12,254 --> 00:23:13,188
Coincidentally, we can

525
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:14,229
use this opportunity to our advantage

526
00:23:14,453 --> 00:23:15,453
and rise to a new height.

527
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,562
Mr Liu,

528
00:23:16,797 --> 00:23:17,797
you'll be in charge of
setting the table.

529
00:23:18,374 --> 00:23:19,206
Professor Ren,

530
00:23:19,413 --> 00:23:20,813
you can set the pace
and do what you do best.

531
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,192
As for us,

532
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:24,573
we'll just assist you guys backstage.

533
00:23:24,654 --> 00:23:25,774
That's right.

534
00:23:25,933 --> 00:23:27,614
We'll be in charge of

535
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:29,894
the cheers.

536
00:23:30,933 --> 00:23:32,213
We have to give it our all.

537
00:23:32,213 --> 00:23:33,774
Good wine needs no bush.

538
00:23:33,974 --> 00:23:35,374
Everyone, look at the liquor.

539
00:23:35,494 --> 00:23:38,134
We know that it's brewed with grains.

540
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,014
However, if we don't look at the brand,

541
00:23:40,534 --> 00:23:42,014
if you don't drink it, and
if I don't tell you what liquor it is,

542
00:23:42,014 --> 00:23:42,933
do you know

543
00:23:42,933 --> 00:23:44,614
what flavour it is?

544
00:23:44,813 --> 00:23:45,813
I took a sniff just now.

545
00:23:47,014 --> 00:23:47,878
It's Luzhou-flavoured.

546
00:23:48,467 --> 00:23:49,295
Amazing.

547
00:23:49,854 --> 00:23:50,854
Professor Ren is amazing.

548
00:23:50,854 --> 00:23:52,333
Amazing. Did you guys see that?

549
00:23:53,173 --> 00:23:54,043
Professor Ren,

550
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:56,173
you're the real deal.

551
00:23:56,254 --> 00:23:57,333
You're not an empty husk.

552
00:23:57,654 --> 00:23:59,093
All of us know that.

553
00:23:59,374 --> 00:24:00,413
However, not everyone in the world
knows about that.

554
00:24:00,854 --> 00:24:01,830
Am I right?

555
00:24:02,093 --> 00:24:04,173
Look at all the scammers out there

556
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:05,933
giving people

557
00:24:05,974 --> 00:24:07,213
fake prescriptions like mung beans

558
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:08,274
and flower petals.

559
00:24:08,534 --> 00:24:10,213
They made a huge fortune out of it.

560
00:24:10,933 --> 00:24:12,053
But Professor Ren,

561
00:24:12,654 --> 00:24:14,333
you've got nothing out of it.

562
00:24:14,654 --> 00:24:16,173
I feel sorry for you.

563
00:24:16,534 --> 00:24:18,293
Yeah, I feel the same.

564
00:24:18,413 --> 00:24:21,293
Professor Ren, I think there's an issue
with your mindset.

565
00:24:21,774 --> 00:24:23,774
You can stick to a simple diet.

566
00:24:24,093 --> 00:24:25,813
However, have you ever thought of
the younger generations?

567
00:24:26,293 --> 00:24:28,333
Have you ever thought of
your students' feelings?

568
00:24:28,933 --> 00:24:29,866
Why do so many phenomenal youths

569
00:24:30,053 --> 00:24:32,293
are doing investments

570
00:24:32,453 --> 00:24:33,734
alongside Warren Buffett?

571
00:24:34,894 --> 00:24:36,413
It's because he's rich.

572
00:24:37,813 --> 00:24:38,726
Being rich

573
00:24:38,933 --> 00:24:40,614
is the most obvious strength

574
00:24:40,734 --> 00:24:42,053
for all laymen to see.

575
00:24:42,894 --> 00:24:43,851
That's why

576
00:24:43,894 --> 00:24:45,293
ambitious youths chose

577
00:24:45,534 --> 00:24:46,693
to follow him.

578
00:24:47,413 --> 00:24:48,614
Does Warren Buffett love money?

579
00:24:48,813 --> 00:24:49,722
I don't think so.

580
00:24:50,134 --> 00:24:52,374
He bought his house for 50,000 dollars.

581
00:24:53,333 --> 00:24:54,933
His favourite burger

582
00:24:55,213 --> 00:24:56,453
only costs eight dollars.

583
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:57,333
So, you see,

584
00:24:57,573 --> 00:25:00,293
Professor Ren, you can choose
to donate your money when you're rich.

585
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:03,254
However, you mustn't stay poor.

586
00:25:03,974 --> 00:25:04,854
If you're poor,

587
00:25:04,974 --> 00:25:06,654
no one is willing to study under you.

588
00:25:08,333 --> 00:25:09,494
That makes total sense.

589
00:25:09,494 --> 00:25:11,494
You're the banner of the TCM industry.

590
00:25:11,813 --> 00:25:12,974
You're our symbol.

591
00:25:12,974 --> 00:25:13,854
With you around,

592
00:25:14,333 --> 00:25:15,333
the revival of the TCM industry

593
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:16,813
is just around the corner.

594
00:25:18,693 --> 00:25:20,974
This is just the beginning.

595
00:25:21,374 --> 00:25:22,894
The TCM industrial park

596
00:25:22,894 --> 00:25:25,093
is just like a piece of land.

597
00:25:25,494 --> 00:25:26,413
The apprentice class

598
00:25:26,813 --> 00:25:28,333
is just like a seed.

599
00:25:28,813 --> 00:25:32,093
Professor Ren is the sun and rain.

600
00:25:32,854 --> 00:25:34,053
As for the rest,

601
00:25:34,254 --> 00:25:37,254
you guys are in charge of
watering and fertilizing the field.

602
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:38,361
By then,

603
00:25:38,494 --> 00:25:39,333
when my tree

604
00:25:39,693 --> 00:25:42,134
is filled with fruits,

605
00:25:42,134 --> 00:25:44,494
we can share
the fruits of labour together.

606
00:25:47,213 --> 00:25:48,141
Good.

607
00:25:49,053 --> 00:25:50,734
Mr Liu, I agree with you.

608
00:25:51,813 --> 00:25:53,813
If so, let's pray that this seed of ours

609
00:25:54,173 --> 00:25:55,053
can grow into

610
00:25:55,254 --> 00:25:56,254
a huge tree.

611
00:25:56,573 --> 00:25:57,436
Here.

612
00:25:57,494 --> 00:25:58,813
Let's have a toast.

613
00:25:58,813 --> 00:25:59,716
Come.

614
00:26:00,413 --> 00:26:01,453
Come.

615
00:26:02,053 --> 00:26:03,374
Come. I'll replace liquor with tea.

616
00:26:03,422 --> 00:26:04,348
Come.

617
00:26:05,734 --> 00:26:06,620
What about this?

618
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:07,951
Guys,

619
00:26:08,374 --> 00:26:10,654
I'm truly touched

620
00:26:11,573 --> 00:26:13,614
by your support for the TCM industry.

621
00:26:14,413 --> 00:26:16,093
Before I drink,

622
00:26:16,293 --> 00:26:17,933
I wish to express

623
00:26:17,933 --> 00:26:19,453
my stand clearly.

624
00:26:19,854 --> 00:26:21,213
This way, at least

625
00:26:21,453 --> 00:26:23,093
your excellent liquor won't go to waste.

626
00:26:25,173 --> 00:26:26,213
You see,

627
00:26:26,974 --> 00:26:28,093
I call a spade a spade.

628
00:26:28,213 --> 00:26:29,453
Warren Buffett is Warren Buffett.

629
00:26:29,453 --> 00:26:30,614
I am me.

630
00:26:31,614 --> 00:26:33,974
In the end,

631
00:26:35,134 --> 00:26:37,534
you and I aren't working for
our own sake.

632
00:26:37,573 --> 00:26:40,213
Let's not talk about
carrying forward the culture.

633
00:26:40,213 --> 00:26:41,933
That's just being boastful.

634
00:26:44,573 --> 00:26:46,494
First, we have to confirm

635
00:26:46,734 --> 00:26:48,374
the definition of wealth.

636
00:26:48,933 --> 00:26:50,093
So, what is wealth?

637
00:26:50,974 --> 00:26:52,093
Wealth doesn't mean

638
00:26:52,333 --> 00:26:54,093
the amount of money
you have in your bank account.

639
00:26:54,974 --> 00:26:56,614
If you don't spend that money

640
00:26:57,213 --> 00:26:59,213
on somewhere useful,

641
00:26:59,213 --> 00:27:01,453
it'll be a waste.

642
00:27:07,494 --> 00:27:08,494
For example,

643
00:27:09,134 --> 00:27:11,573
if you buy a house of
1,000 square meters,

644
00:27:11,854 --> 00:27:13,374
that means you're the slave
of that house.

645
00:27:14,453 --> 00:27:16,614
If you buy a ten million yuan car,

646
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:18,734
I don't think the insurance company

647
00:27:19,093 --> 00:27:21,333
will insure your car.

648
00:27:22,134 --> 00:27:23,894
So guys, what's the definition
of insurance?

649
00:27:25,933 --> 00:27:27,614
It's God.

650
00:27:29,494 --> 00:27:31,813
God has a ledger.

651
00:27:32,933 --> 00:27:34,734
If you're on the righteous path,

652
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:37,933
you can just give it your all
without any hesitations.

653
00:27:38,134 --> 00:27:39,693
However, if you're not,

654
00:27:40,093 --> 00:27:41,614
God will see everything.

655
00:27:43,813 --> 00:27:45,213
God can tell.

656
00:27:47,213 --> 00:27:48,333
You're being petty,

657
00:27:48,974 --> 00:27:49,813
you have ulterior motives, and so on.

658
00:27:55,813 --> 00:27:57,093
Therefore, being a doctor

659
00:27:57,093 --> 00:27:58,693
is different from other occupations.

660
00:27:59,453 --> 00:28:00,614
If doctors

661
00:28:01,213 --> 00:28:02,974
want to strike it rich,

662
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:06,254
God will punish us.

663
00:28:08,134 --> 00:28:09,854
Let's just take

664
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:12,374
my apprentice class as an example.

665
00:28:12,374 --> 00:28:13,734
Maybe the apprentice class

666
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:15,693
might be a long

667
00:28:16,093 --> 00:28:17,374
and fruitless process.

668
00:28:18,453 --> 00:28:19,894
Maybe it'll bear fruit.

669
00:28:21,453 --> 00:28:22,693
That means

670
00:28:23,254 --> 00:28:25,134
we might not be able to witness
the result in our lifetime.

671
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:29,293
I'm sure you guys know this too.

672
00:28:30,693 --> 00:28:31,813
It takes ten years to nurture a tree,

673
00:28:32,333 --> 00:28:33,374
but a hundred years to train a man.

674
00:28:33,374 --> 00:28:35,254
If you all wish

675
00:28:35,254 --> 00:28:37,494
to gain something from this,

676
00:28:37,933 --> 00:28:40,453
you shouldn't use the name of TCM.

677
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:42,374
I'm not smart.

678
00:28:43,093 --> 00:28:44,494
But I'm not silly either.

679
00:28:45,213 --> 00:28:47,693
Mr Liu, in the future,

680
00:28:47,693 --> 00:28:50,053
you shouldn't hold gatherings like this.

681
00:28:50,614 --> 00:28:51,854
It's not worth it

682
00:28:52,693 --> 00:28:54,333
to spend your money on someone like me.

683
00:28:55,093 --> 00:28:55,933
It's not worth it.

684
00:28:59,573 --> 00:29:00,494
Here, let's have a toast.

685
00:29:06,974 --> 00:29:07,876
Excellent liquor.

686
00:29:34,974 --> 00:29:36,053
You scared me.

687
00:29:36,053 --> 00:29:37,333
I thought your father was here.

688
00:29:37,974 --> 00:29:39,453
Aren't you going to hand in
your homework tomorrow?

689
00:29:42,453 --> 00:29:43,413
I have so much work to complete.

690
00:29:44,093 --> 00:29:44,974
I gave it some thought.

691
00:29:45,254 --> 00:29:46,333
I can't finish copying them anyway.

692
00:29:46,734 --> 00:29:48,093
It's better to let your father
punish me.

693
00:29:48,333 --> 00:29:49,774
This way, it's satisfying
for both him and me.

694
00:29:50,333 --> 00:29:51,614
My father never punishes people.

695
00:29:54,093 --> 00:29:54,934
Is that so?

696
00:29:55,614 --> 00:29:57,413
He'll chase you out directly.

697
00:30:03,333 --> 00:30:04,813
This is no fun.

698
00:30:05,413 --> 00:30:07,333
He chases people out?

699
00:30:09,854 --> 00:30:10,854
How could I finish

700
00:30:11,854 --> 00:30:13,654
copying all of them?

701
00:30:14,333 --> 00:30:15,134
Look at them.

702
00:30:16,494 --> 00:30:17,324
Give it to me.

703
00:30:18,614 --> 00:30:19,894
-What are you doing?
-Make way.

704
00:30:20,134 --> 00:30:20,984
Wait.

705
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:24,040
Grandson, what are you doing?

706
00:30:33,974 --> 00:30:35,614
Could it be that
you're trying to help me?

707
00:30:36,213 --> 00:30:37,120
To be honest,

708
00:30:38,494 --> 00:30:40,053
it's pretty difficult to imitate

709
00:30:40,734 --> 00:30:41,693
your terrible writing.

710
00:30:49,854 --> 00:30:50,693
I've left some space for you.

711
00:30:50,693 --> 00:30:51,614
Just fill in the blanks.

712
00:30:51,734 --> 00:30:52,628
Understood.

713
00:30:56,614 --> 00:30:57,774
Ling Ju?

714
00:31:03,453 --> 00:31:04,323
You're using your left hand?

715
00:31:04,614 --> 00:31:05,573
Are you sure you can do it?

716
00:31:05,693 --> 00:31:06,564
My left hand is better than your right.

717
00:31:09,453 --> 00:31:10,534
Why don't you use your foot then?

718
00:31:12,134 --> 00:31:13,813
Use your toes

719
00:31:13,813 --> 00:31:15,093
to grab the brush.

720
00:31:15,093 --> 00:31:16,654
Grab it and write it like this.

721
00:31:17,374 --> 00:31:18,268
Can you do it?

722
00:31:19,494 --> 00:31:20,693
Can you write it backhand?

723
00:31:20,933 --> 00:31:21,974
Like this.

724
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:23,161
Like this.

725
00:31:23,213 --> 00:31:24,034
Like this.

726
00:31:25,213 --> 00:31:26,076
Like this.

727
00:31:29,134 --> 00:31:30,057
What about this?

728
00:31:31,053 --> 00:31:31,988
What about this?

729
00:31:32,693 --> 00:31:33,494
Put your arm at the back.

730
00:31:34,093 --> 00:31:35,614
This is pretty cool.

731
00:31:35,614 --> 00:31:36,854
What about this? Try and lift your leg.

732
00:31:38,093 --> 00:31:38,939
Can you do it like this?

733
00:31:49,453 --> 00:31:50,293
Grandson.

734
00:31:51,014 --> 00:31:51,933
I recognise

735
00:31:52,213 --> 00:31:53,213
all these characters.

736
00:31:53,293 --> 00:31:54,894
But I just don't understand them.

737
00:31:55,254 --> 00:31:57,254
What's the use of
writing and memorizing them

738
00:31:57,254 --> 00:31:58,333
every day?

739
00:31:59,854 --> 00:32:01,734
It'll be useful eventually.

740
00:32:02,014 --> 00:32:03,654
It's an enlightening process.

741
00:32:04,494 --> 00:32:06,573
Maybe you'll be enlightened one day.

742
00:32:06,974 --> 00:32:08,453
You recited it every day since young.

743
00:32:08,734 --> 00:32:09,734
Were you enlightened?

744
00:32:15,293 --> 00:32:16,173
Were you?

745
00:32:18,933 --> 00:32:20,093
Hey, were you enlightened?

746
00:32:20,093 --> 00:32:21,413
Is that so hard to answer?

747
00:32:23,213 --> 00:32:24,173
Enlightened...

748
00:32:24,854 --> 00:32:26,573
Were you enlightened?

749
00:32:26,573 --> 00:32:27,485
What do you mean?

750
00:32:30,453 --> 00:32:34,093
♫ Waves upon waves ♫

751
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:38,813
♫ Miles of never-ending waves ♫

752
00:32:38,813 --> 00:32:40,333
Nephew, you're back.

753
00:32:41,093 --> 00:32:41,974
You're still awake at this hour?

754
00:32:41,974 --> 00:32:42,792
What were you up to?

755
00:32:42,974 --> 00:32:45,173
I was practising my Cantonese.

756
00:32:46,854 --> 00:32:47,654
What's the matter?

757
00:32:48,332 --> 00:32:49,173
What are you doing?

758
00:32:51,614 --> 00:32:52,974
Didn't you tell me to copy it?

759
00:32:57,813 --> 00:32:58,693
I'll check it tomorrow.

760
00:32:59,534 --> 00:33:00,431
Fine with me.

761
00:33:01,213 --> 00:33:02,374
Don't try to trick me.

762
00:33:02,494 --> 00:33:03,654
Got it.

763
00:33:26,573 --> 00:33:27,476
You're back.

764
00:33:30,374 --> 00:33:32,014
Did you take alcohol?

765
00:33:32,854 --> 00:33:33,681
Only a little.

766
00:33:34,854 --> 00:33:36,213
I drank one cup
and severed my ties with them.

767
00:33:36,854 --> 00:33:37,974
The liquor was excellent.

768
00:33:38,854 --> 00:33:39,759
What a waste of fine liquor.

769
00:33:40,734 --> 00:33:42,014
Who did you offend again?

770
00:33:43,333 --> 00:33:44,160
Wait.

771
00:33:44,333 --> 00:33:45,854
Who offended you again?

772
00:33:45,854 --> 00:33:47,333
"Offend" isn't the right term for it.

773
00:33:48,134 --> 00:33:49,061
It's called

774
00:33:49,693 --> 00:33:51,093
fated to part ways.

775
00:33:55,734 --> 00:33:57,614
I guess we're fated to part ways then.

776
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:04,293
I'm getting old.

777
00:34:04,854 --> 00:34:06,134
I got drunk after drinking one cup.

778
00:34:06,374 --> 00:34:07,494
I was spouting nonsense.

779
00:34:10,854 --> 00:34:12,534
Did you see Tou Tou
when you came upstairs?

780
00:34:12,974 --> 00:34:13,894
She's doing her homework.

781
00:34:17,734 --> 00:34:18,734
She's not doing it.

782
00:34:18,734 --> 00:34:20,254
Your son's doing it for her.

783
00:34:21,093 --> 00:34:23,333
No wonder the room
next to ours is so quiet.

784
00:34:25,333 --> 00:34:27,453
Tian Zhen never treated her
as an equal before.

785
00:34:27,854 --> 00:34:30,134
Why is he trying to do
her homework for her now?

786
00:34:30,734 --> 00:34:33,134
Your son is just trying
to atone for his mistakes.

787
00:34:35,494 --> 00:34:37,413
However, he's still a good boy.

788
00:34:37,734 --> 00:34:38,854
At least he knows his faults now.

789
00:34:42,854 --> 00:34:45,293
I guess the phrase
"In wine, there is truth" is true.

790
00:34:47,974 --> 00:34:49,573
You should drink more in the future.

791
00:34:58,134 --> 00:35:00,654
Don't tell me you're going
to check it page by page?

792
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:09,472
Alright.

793
00:35:10,173 --> 00:35:11,453
You're done with this month's task.

794
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:13,573
The drinking incident

795
00:35:14,093 --> 00:35:15,018
is over now.

796
00:35:16,374 --> 00:35:17,734
It was an accident.

797
00:35:17,734 --> 00:35:19,293
I will never get drunk again.

798
00:35:19,293 --> 00:35:20,813
I'm serious. I can hold my liquor well.

799
00:35:21,413 --> 00:35:22,343
Alright.

800
00:35:22,374 --> 00:35:23,173
You can proceed with it in the future.

801
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:25,494
You mean taking alcohol?

802
00:35:26,854 --> 00:35:27,813
Writing.

803
00:35:29,053 --> 00:35:30,693
What do you mean?

804
00:35:33,494 --> 00:35:34,534
But why?

805
00:35:34,534 --> 00:35:36,053
I thought you said
the incident was over?

806
00:35:36,053 --> 00:35:37,173
Why do I still have to write?

807
00:35:38,734 --> 00:35:40,173
This is your punishment.

808
00:35:40,413 --> 00:35:41,573
After this, you'll be doing homework.

809
00:35:44,254 --> 00:35:46,133
I can memorise them.

810
00:35:46,254 --> 00:35:47,173
I can memorise their
medicinal properties,

811
00:35:47,173 --> 00:35:48,054
the Pharmacopoeia, and everything else.

812
00:35:48,213 --> 00:35:49,094
Can I not write them down?

813
00:35:49,094 --> 00:35:50,653
Why must I write them down?

814
00:35:50,653 --> 00:35:52,133
Why do you have so many questions?

815
00:35:52,933 --> 00:35:54,014
Just write when I tell you to.

816
00:35:54,734 --> 00:35:56,054
You'll understand why eventually.

817
00:35:56,653 --> 00:35:58,373
I'm not willing to do it
without knowing what's going on.

818
00:35:58,373 --> 00:35:59,173
That's just

819
00:35:59,173 --> 00:36:00,893
a waste of time.

820
00:36:01,334 --> 00:36:02,250
And,

821
00:36:03,054 --> 00:36:04,334
you're not telling me

822
00:36:05,853 --> 00:36:06,693
because you have no idea too.

823
00:36:07,334 --> 00:36:08,173
Was it because

824
00:36:09,413 --> 00:36:10,893
your master taught you
in the same manner?

825
00:36:11,334 --> 00:36:12,853
Is that why you copy him blindly

826
00:36:12,853 --> 00:36:13,734
and teach me in the same way?

827
00:36:14,173 --> 00:36:16,494
Is this your so-called legacy?

828
00:36:17,054 --> 00:36:17,880
And, do you think

829
00:36:17,974 --> 00:36:19,974
that I need to learn everything
even if I don't understand them?

830
00:36:21,893 --> 00:36:22,693
When I was young,

831
00:36:22,693 --> 00:36:24,613
I did whatever my master told me to.

832
00:36:25,014 --> 00:36:26,413
Unlike you. You ask questions

833
00:36:26,413 --> 00:36:27,534
before you do it.

834
00:36:27,613 --> 00:36:28,453
-You have so many questions.
-You're wrong.

835
00:36:28,453 --> 00:36:29,494
Times have changed.

836
00:36:29,494 --> 00:36:30,933
And, things are different now.

837
00:36:31,213 --> 00:36:32,574
If you didn't study hard

838
00:36:32,613 --> 00:36:34,413
or obey your master,
he would kick you out.

839
00:36:34,893 --> 00:36:36,373
It's different for us.

840
00:36:36,373 --> 00:36:37,208
You see,

841
00:36:37,254 --> 00:36:38,653
you told me to study.

842
00:36:38,853 --> 00:36:40,094
However, if you don't listen,

843
00:36:40,094 --> 00:36:40,933
and if I don't study,

844
00:36:41,413 --> 00:36:42,974
you'll have no successor.

845
00:36:43,574 --> 00:36:45,933
Your master will definitely
reprimand you for that,

846
00:36:46,413 --> 00:36:47,337
right?

847
00:36:50,094 --> 00:36:51,064
Tou Tou,

848
00:36:51,653 --> 00:36:52,613
you need to learn

849
00:36:52,613 --> 00:36:55,814
how to find order in disorder.

850
00:36:56,413 --> 00:36:57,302
What do you mean?

851
00:36:58,054 --> 00:36:58,893
Learn slowly

852
00:36:58,893 --> 00:36:59,893
and take it slow.

853
00:36:59,893 --> 00:37:02,893
You'll be suddenly enlightened one day.

854
00:37:04,653 --> 00:37:06,173
Your genes are amazing indeed.

855
00:37:06,494 --> 00:37:08,534
You and your son speak
in the same manner.

856
00:37:08,933 --> 00:37:10,613
When you can't explain something,

857
00:37:10,653 --> 00:37:11,974
you'll use the term "enlightened".

858
00:37:12,334 --> 00:37:13,653
It's like you're talking about
metaphysics.

859
00:37:15,213 --> 00:37:16,574
Since you don't want to accept it,

860
00:37:16,893 --> 00:37:18,054
I'll take back the reward then.

861
00:37:18,173 --> 00:37:19,069
Reward...

862
00:37:20,693 --> 00:37:21,734
Reward?

863
00:37:23,814 --> 00:37:24,750
What reward?

864
00:37:25,893 --> 00:37:27,373
Do you intend to reward me?

865
00:37:27,373 --> 00:37:28,373
Why are you rewarding me?

866
00:37:30,453 --> 00:37:32,054
I'm rewarding you
for keeping your promise.

867
00:37:33,213 --> 00:37:34,173
I'm rewarding you

868
00:37:34,373 --> 00:37:35,933
for complete this month's task.

869
00:37:36,653 --> 00:37:37,974
I'm rewarding you

870
00:37:38,693 --> 00:37:41,853
for brewing Meng Meng's medicine
successfully.

871
00:37:43,254 --> 00:37:44,494
What will you reward me with?

872
00:37:45,653 --> 00:37:47,014
Will we go to the claw machine arcade?

873
00:37:47,494 --> 00:37:48,613
Is that it?

874
00:37:51,094 --> 00:37:52,413
You'll know it by then.

875
00:37:52,413 --> 00:37:53,413
How long is "by then"?

876
00:38:06,133 --> 00:38:07,054
There's a reward?

877
00:38:07,653 --> 00:38:09,254
If so, I'll wait here.

878
00:38:10,893 --> 00:38:12,054
You can wait here.

879
00:38:12,054 --> 00:38:12,893
Okay.

880
00:38:16,574 --> 00:38:17,774
Are you leaving?

881
00:38:38,413 --> 00:38:39,274
My reward!

882
00:38:40,166 --> 00:38:41,094
Where's my reward?

883
00:38:43,494 --> 00:38:44,397
My reward.

884
00:38:44,653 --> 00:38:45,613
I waited the whole day.

885
00:38:45,613 --> 00:38:46,653
Where's my reward?

886
00:38:50,094 --> 00:38:51,048
What do you mean by this?

887
00:38:51,373 --> 00:38:52,453
I'm rewarding you with a drink.

888
00:38:52,613 --> 00:38:54,094
I'll teach you how to drink.

889
00:38:56,054 --> 00:38:58,133
I don't need you to teach me that.

890
00:38:58,133 --> 00:38:59,056
It's second nature to me.

891
00:38:59,974 --> 00:39:01,453
For the word "Yi" in Chinese Medicine,
the bottom half

892
00:39:01,974 --> 00:39:04,574
is the same as the bottom half of "Jiu",
which means alcohol.

893
00:39:05,213 --> 00:39:06,693
That's not true.

894
00:39:07,494 --> 00:39:08,774
That's true for
the traditional characters.

895
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,764
(Yi)

896
00:39:15,173 --> 00:39:15,974
I know that.

897
00:39:15,974 --> 00:39:16,933
It's written like this.

898
00:39:16,933 --> 00:39:17,774
Like this.

899
00:39:17,893 --> 00:39:19,254
So, alcohol

900
00:39:19,814 --> 00:39:20,618
can be a form of medicine too.

901
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:21,952
When you take medicine,

902
00:39:22,413 --> 00:39:23,653
you need to follow the nature
and seasons.

903
00:39:24,054 --> 00:39:25,613
The best period for taking alcohol

904
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:26,734
should be the hour of You.

905
00:39:32,213 --> 00:39:33,146
The hour of You?

906
00:39:34,254 --> 00:39:36,173
It's from 5pm to 7pm.

907
00:39:36,534 --> 00:39:38,054
Remember, it's the hour of You.

908
00:39:38,814 --> 00:39:40,173
It's no wonder you started taking dinner

909
00:39:40,173 --> 00:39:41,213
around 5pm.

910
00:39:41,534 --> 00:39:43,574
When you take alcohol
during this period,

911
00:39:43,893 --> 00:39:44,778
not only will it not harm your body,

912
00:39:44,998 --> 00:39:45,837
but it also nourishes it.

913
00:39:46,014 --> 00:39:47,694
The best period to take alcohol

914
00:39:47,982 --> 00:39:49,621
is from 5pm to 7pm.

915
00:39:50,173 --> 00:39:52,893
You need some pig ears and peanuts too.

916
00:39:53,413 --> 00:39:55,054
That's how you get your nourishment.

917
00:39:55,413 --> 00:39:57,814
Therefore, we must adapt what we do

918
00:39:58,254 --> 00:39:59,413
to local conditions

919
00:39:59,653 --> 00:40:00,893
and time.

920
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:10,655
Master,

921
00:40:10,734 --> 00:40:11,734
I think

922
00:40:11,734 --> 00:40:12,853
you have too many rules to follow.

923
00:40:12,853 --> 00:40:13,814
That's so troublesome.

924
00:40:13,974 --> 00:40:15,094
We should drink like this.

925
00:40:15,893 --> 00:40:18,373
Bottoms up, every cup. That's the way.

926
00:40:18,436 --> 00:40:19,321
Remember,

927
00:40:19,574 --> 00:40:20,814
alcohol can benefit

928
00:40:21,133 --> 00:40:22,173
and harm our bodies.

929
00:40:23,413 --> 00:40:24,254
If you wish

930
00:40:24,574 --> 00:40:26,893
to take alcohol even at an old age,

931
00:40:27,173 --> 00:40:29,014
you have to follow these rules.

932
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:29,960
I know that.

933
00:40:30,373 --> 00:40:31,933
I know.

934
00:40:32,574 --> 00:40:34,413
We need to follow these rules.

935
00:40:35,373 --> 00:40:36,653
When you know something,

936
00:40:36,653 --> 00:40:37,534
you don't.

937
00:40:37,734 --> 00:40:38,549
Cheers.

938
00:40:39,734 --> 00:40:40,734
Excellent words.

939
00:40:40,853 --> 00:40:41,696
Don't you think?

940
00:40:43,814 --> 00:40:45,254
Take a small sip.

941
00:40:45,254 --> 00:40:46,653
Don't finish it in one go.

942
00:40:47,254 --> 00:40:48,294
Feel it.

943
00:40:48,893 --> 00:40:50,133
Feel the scent

944
00:40:50,494 --> 00:40:51,933
spreading

945
00:40:52,173 --> 00:40:53,653
inside your mouth.

946
00:40:54,054 --> 00:40:55,453
Try and track

947
00:40:55,893 --> 00:40:57,453
the motion of the alcohol

948
00:40:57,853 --> 00:40:59,094
entering your body.

949
00:41:03,734 --> 00:41:04,774
Have you swallowed it?

950
00:41:06,094 --> 00:41:07,094
Of course.

951
00:41:07,094 --> 00:41:08,413
How could I not swallow it?

952
00:41:08,413 --> 00:41:09,413
I had it in my mouth for so long.

953
00:41:09,413 --> 00:41:10,313
How do you feel?

954
00:41:12,413 --> 00:41:14,254
Indeed. This part feels pretty warm.

955
00:41:14,534 --> 00:41:15,494
It feels warm.

956
00:41:15,574 --> 00:41:17,173
There's a phrase

957
00:41:17,453 --> 00:41:18,653
called Dutch courage.

958
00:41:19,933 --> 00:41:21,054
When you take alcohol,

959
00:41:21,613 --> 00:41:23,734
it reaches the Gallbladder Meridian
of Foot Shaoyang.

960
00:41:24,974 --> 00:41:26,814
-Gallbladder Meridian.
-Until the bottom part.

961
00:41:26,814 --> 00:41:28,653
-The bottom part.
-This part you mentioned.

962
00:41:29,094 --> 00:41:29,953
Here.

963
00:41:30,453 --> 00:41:32,054
That's the Yangming Meridian.

964
00:41:32,054 --> 00:41:32,974
Yangming Meridian.

965
00:41:32,974 --> 00:41:35,373
That's why you feel warm.

966
00:41:35,373 --> 00:41:36,334
You're very thoughtful.

967
00:41:37,413 --> 00:41:38,933
You do live up to your name.

968
00:41:39,373 --> 00:41:40,613
You know everything.

969
00:41:40,613 --> 00:41:42,163
You're amazing.

970
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:43,068
Cheers.

971
00:41:43,373 --> 00:41:44,213
What do you mean by that?

972
00:41:44,254 --> 00:41:45,173
Pronounce it clearly.

973
00:41:45,413 --> 00:41:47,413
I was saying that you were amazing.

974
00:41:47,653 --> 00:41:48,599
Understood?

975
00:41:48,893 --> 00:41:49,734
Master, listen.

976
00:41:49,734 --> 00:41:50,893
Although you're treating me
to a drink today,

977
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:52,974
this is barely enough.

978
00:41:53,133 --> 00:41:54,133
We need more.

979
00:41:54,893 --> 00:41:57,534
According to
Compendium of Materia Medica,

980
00:41:57,534 --> 00:41:58,574
taking excessive alcohol

981
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:00,933
will hurt the mind, waste the blood,

982
00:42:01,173 --> 00:42:02,933
damage the stomach,
and dampen the spirit.

983
00:42:03,173 --> 00:42:04,734
Take everything in moderation.

984
00:42:05,734 --> 00:42:07,133
This is my reward for you.

985
00:42:07,309 --> 00:42:08,112
-Here.
-Alright.

986
00:42:08,213 --> 00:42:09,294
If so,

987
00:42:09,653 --> 00:42:10,494
I'll take the entire pot.

988
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:11,933
I don't want to share it with you.

989
00:42:16,853 --> 00:42:18,173
Just pour a little for me.

990
00:42:18,173 --> 00:42:18,974
Take everything in moderation.

991
00:42:18,974 --> 00:42:20,014
You said so yourself.

992
00:42:21,734 --> 00:42:22,587
-Just a little more.
-Stop drinking.

993
00:42:22,653 --> 00:42:24,094
-Just a little more.
-Stop drinking. Have some food.

994
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:24,969
Alright.

995
00:42:25,094 --> 00:42:26,294
Your mouth is so oily.

996
00:42:26,294 --> 00:42:27,373
Wipe your mouth.

997
00:42:27,574 --> 00:42:28,893
Stop drinking.

998
00:42:31,054 --> 00:42:32,453
Wait. What are you doing?

999
00:42:32,613 --> 00:42:33,527
Hey.

1000
00:42:33,734 --> 00:42:34,693
There's not much left.

1001
00:42:35,213 --> 00:42:36,133
Just a little.

1002
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,748

1003
