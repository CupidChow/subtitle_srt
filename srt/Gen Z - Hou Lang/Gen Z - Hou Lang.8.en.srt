1
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,920
(Gen Z)

2
00:01:35,734 --> 00:01:37,734
(Episode 8)

3
00:01:39,726 --> 00:01:41,286
Picture it in your mind.

4
00:01:41,366 --> 00:01:43,887
Imagine the Big Dipper

5
00:01:44,566 --> 00:01:46,127
as a clock.

6
00:01:47,687 --> 00:01:50,887
When the Big Dipper points to Chen,

7
00:01:50,967 --> 00:01:51,846
it's the time of Grain Rain.

8
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,207
-Chen?
-That's right.

9
00:01:55,945 --> 00:01:56,906
What time is that?

10
00:01:57,647 --> 00:01:59,006
From 7am to 9am,

11
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,801
when you have breakfast.

12
00:02:02,006 --> 00:02:03,567
But why is it called Grain Rain?

13
00:02:03,647 --> 00:02:04,567
It's not raining here.

14
00:02:05,407 --> 00:02:07,167
It will rain at night.

15
00:02:08,113 --> 00:02:10,352
Grain Rain brings rain,

16
00:02:10,926 --> 00:02:12,127
indicating a good harvest.

17
00:02:12,207 --> 00:02:13,726
This year is bound

18
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,406
to be a year of good harvest.

19
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,066
Did you predict this
through fortune-telling?

20
00:02:24,886 --> 00:02:26,647
Our ancestors told me.

21
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,080
In the city,

22
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,721
we are always busy with our works.

23
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,761
We have forgotten
to look up at the stars.

24
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,920
Liu Ci Xin wrote a novel series called
Remembrance of Earth's Past.

25
00:03:00,487 --> 00:03:02,986
It tells the story of Earth's
inhabitants transforming

26
00:03:03,773 --> 00:03:05,013
the planet into a supercollider

27
00:03:05,054 --> 00:03:06,534
hundreds of years in the future.

28
00:03:07,245 --> 00:03:09,806
When they are ready to carry out
collective interstellar travel,

29
00:03:10,873 --> 00:03:12,706
their plans are disrupted
by cosmic envoys.

30
00:03:13,337 --> 00:03:14,303
People ask the envoys

31
00:03:14,963 --> 00:03:17,858
when they first noticed their plans,

32
00:03:19,858 --> 00:03:20,977
the envoys respond

33
00:03:22,657 --> 00:03:24,377
that it began 370,000 years ago

34
00:03:25,657 --> 00:03:28,617
when ten primitive humans
looked up at the stars with wonder.

35
00:03:31,657 --> 00:03:34,418
When we learn to appreciate the beauty
that is unrelated to survival,

36
00:03:35,778 --> 00:03:37,778
and when we have curiosity
about all things,

37
00:03:39,337 --> 00:03:40,778
we become the spirit of the Earth.

38
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,520
This can fit...

39
00:04:03,617 --> 00:04:05,457
Can I take the top bunk?

40
00:04:05,897 --> 00:04:07,337
Can I take the top bunk?

41
00:04:08,097 --> 00:04:08,897
Allow me.

42
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:13,378
Don't put your bags on the bed.
It's dirty. Take it down.

43
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,320
You mean this?

44
00:04:16,457 --> 00:04:17,257
Slow down.

45
00:04:20,097 --> 00:04:20,897
Here, Tian Zhen.

46
00:04:20,977 --> 00:04:22,298
Mum, let me help you.
Let me.

47
00:04:22,938 --> 00:04:25,058
Meng Meng, can I take the top bunk?

48
00:04:25,651 --> 00:04:26,451
Tou Tou,

49
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,120
you must wash up
before going to bed in the future.

50
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,479
You shouldn't just
get into bed like that.

51
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,440
I know.

52
00:04:32,938 --> 00:04:33,738
Unbelievable.

53
00:04:36,578 --> 00:04:38,978
This is the only room left
in our house.

54
00:04:39,058 --> 00:04:40,257
You two will stay together

55
00:04:40,337 --> 00:04:41,697
and look after each other.

56
00:04:42,298 --> 00:04:43,617
I will look after Meng Meng.

57
00:04:43,697 --> 00:04:45,138
Don't worry, Meng Meng.

58
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:46,243
I'm not sleeping.

59
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,017
I will definitely protect you

60
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,641
in every way possible.

61
00:04:50,418 --> 00:04:52,338
Mum, Sun Tou Tou is unreliable.

62
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,760
Let me take care of Meng Meng.

63
00:04:53,858 --> 00:04:54,778
Listen to yourself.

64
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,120
What do you mean I'm unreliable?

65
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:59,680
Do you know that my credibility
is what sustains me out there?

66
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,959
You had lost

67
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,920
your credibility

68
00:05:02,018 --> 00:05:03,418
from the moment we first met.

69
00:05:03,684 --> 00:05:04,484
Tian Zhen,

70
00:05:05,344 --> 00:05:06,384
go back to your room.

71
00:05:06,498 --> 00:05:07,391
Go back to your room.

72
00:05:08,644 --> 00:05:09,564
I declare that

73
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,440
starting from today,

74
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,840
our home will have separate
male and female bedrooms.

75
00:05:14,938 --> 00:05:16,177
No one is allowed

76
00:05:17,018 --> 00:05:18,517
to enter each other's rooms
after 10pm.

77
00:05:19,558 --> 00:05:20,358
Is that clear?

78
00:05:24,298 --> 00:05:26,138
What about you and my nephew?

79
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,480
Your nephew?

80
00:05:28,138 --> 00:05:28,938
Your husband.

81
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,120
Does it concern you?

82
00:05:33,211 --> 00:05:34,791
Are you going to sleep separately too?

83
00:05:37,197 --> 00:05:38,756
We have another rule in our home.

84
00:05:39,018 --> 00:05:41,338
After 10pm, everyone's phones
should be placed

85
00:05:41,464 --> 00:05:42,824
in the living room for charging.

86
00:05:42,944 --> 00:05:44,263
No phones in the bedroom.

87
00:05:45,696 --> 00:05:48,164
This way, we can avoid radiation

88
00:05:48,537 --> 00:05:50,177
and have a peaceful rest.

89
00:05:50,938 --> 00:05:52,218
Not including me, right?

90
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,441
Especially you.

91
00:05:54,757 --> 00:05:56,117
I can't sleep without my phone.

92
00:05:56,538 --> 00:05:57,844
Many people nowadays

93
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,216
have trouble falling asleep
because they play with their phones.

94
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,640
I have to listen to stories
before I sleep.

95
00:06:01,716 --> 00:06:03,497
Usually, it's the mother
who tells stories.

96
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,521
I don't have a mother,

97
00:06:04,631 --> 00:06:05,431
so I have to

98
00:06:05,676 --> 00:06:07,777
play some stories on my phone

99
00:06:07,857 --> 00:06:08,778
to help me sleep.

100
00:06:09,137 --> 00:06:10,337
You are an adult now.

101
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,680
It's time to say goodbye to your mother
and sleep on your own.

102
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:13,986
Are you stupid?

103
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:16,751
We are on the same side
on this issue.

104
00:06:17,058 --> 00:06:18,417
I have a mother.

105
00:06:35,538 --> 00:06:36,338
Sun Tou Tou.

106
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,993
I was messing with you.

107
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:41,960
You see,

108
00:06:43,417 --> 00:06:45,003
you're just exhausting yourself
like this.

109
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,200
Every day you exhaust yourself

110
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,600
until you're completely drained
before going to bed.

111
00:06:49,698 --> 00:06:51,337
This is a vicious cycle.

112
00:06:51,457 --> 00:06:52,337
I'm talking to you.

113
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,001
To have a good night's sleep,

114
00:06:56,218 --> 00:06:58,457
you shouldn't bring your phone
into the bedroom.

115
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,441
I can't control myself.

116
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,519
You can learn to control yourself.

117
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:04,810
From now on,

118
00:07:05,004 --> 00:07:05,970
don't cross your legs.

119
00:07:07,417 --> 00:07:08,737
Sit up. Sit up.

120
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,440
Start from the Guiding Technique.

121
00:07:11,938 --> 00:07:12,738
Sit up.

122
00:07:15,617 --> 00:07:18,297
Place your hands on Shanzhong acupoint.

123
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,961
That's right. Follow the Ren Meridian.

124
00:07:21,298 --> 00:07:22,298
Go down.

125
00:07:23,297 --> 00:07:24,337
Good.

126
00:07:24,698 --> 00:07:27,938
Place your right palm

127
00:07:28,497 --> 00:07:30,018
over your navel.

128
00:07:30,643 --> 00:07:31,684
Cover it

129
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,930
with your left palm.

130
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,400
Start rubbing it

131
00:07:36,457 --> 00:07:37,737
counterclockwise.

132
00:07:38,977 --> 00:07:40,297
Counterclockwise.

133
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,321
Counter...

134
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:45,058
Counterclockwise.

135
00:07:46,617 --> 00:07:47,417
That's right.

136
00:07:47,737 --> 00:07:49,297
Rotate 25 times.

137
00:07:50,337 --> 00:07:51,417
Relax your shoulders.

138
00:07:52,677 --> 00:07:53,856
Maintain a straight posture.

139
00:07:54,017 --> 00:07:54,937
Continue massaging in this manner.

140
00:07:55,017 --> 00:07:58,017
Massage 25 times
before going to bed every night.

141
00:08:00,337 --> 00:08:02,063
Have you learned how to do it,
Meng Meng?

142
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,919
She knows how to do it now, Mum.

143
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,800
Good.

144
00:08:05,263 --> 00:08:06,403
Come on, Tian Zhen.

145
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,853
I will leave her to you.

146
00:09:32,442 --> 00:09:33,457
Have you settled them in?

147
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:35,096
I always finished

148
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,200
the tasks you instructed me to do.

149
00:09:40,778 --> 00:09:41,578
Give me your hand.

150
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:49,943
I could tell from your eating posture

151
00:09:50,024 --> 00:09:51,469
that there is an issue with your hand.

152
00:09:51,737 --> 00:09:52,698
I

153
00:09:53,137 --> 00:09:54,857
strained my muscle while lifting

154
00:09:55,098 --> 00:09:55,938
the heavy pot today.

155
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,919
You lifted

156
00:10:02,297 --> 00:10:04,017
such a big pot with just one hand.

157
00:10:04,871 --> 00:10:06,177
Do you think you're Wu Song?

158
00:10:06,258 --> 00:10:08,537
I couldn't let it fall
on Li Quan's head, could it?

159
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,266
I think the one you're worried about
is Sun Tou Tou.

160
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:13,544
If she didn't always cause trouble,

161
00:10:13,698 --> 00:10:15,378
you wouldn't have ended up like this.

162
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:18,537
Why do you always blame
everything on Sun Tou Tou?

163
00:10:18,617 --> 00:10:21,058
Don't deny that you favour her.

164
00:10:21,856 --> 00:10:23,657
You've never been this patient

165
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,201
to your students,

166
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,851
not even with your own son.

167
00:10:28,138 --> 00:10:30,258
You treat her like
she's the apple of your eye.

168
00:10:32,617 --> 00:10:34,138
You're going overboard.

169
00:10:49,964 --> 00:10:51,883
As the head of the household,

170
00:10:52,657 --> 00:10:53,777
you have to be righteous

171
00:10:54,217 --> 00:10:55,777
and set an example for the children.

172
00:10:56,578 --> 00:10:57,458
Did you

173
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,018
leave the phone case downstairs

174
00:10:59,217 --> 00:11:00,537
and disguise it as a phone again?

175
00:11:01,217 --> 00:11:02,498
As the head of the household,

176
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:04,297
can't I have some privileges?

177
00:11:05,138 --> 00:11:05,938
Besides,

178
00:11:06,578 --> 00:11:08,178
I'm not like those kids

179
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:10,369
who play games and watch TikTok

180
00:11:10,578 --> 00:11:11,537
on their phones.

181
00:11:11,657 --> 00:11:13,938
All this burning the midnight oil

182
00:11:14,018 --> 00:11:16,217
and straining my eyes
is all for your sake.

183
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,560
Yes, yes.

184
00:11:18,417 --> 00:11:19,217
Yes.

185
00:11:20,018 --> 00:11:23,018
Madam Song, who has the privilege,

186
00:11:23,304 --> 00:11:24,126
can you

187
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,759
please help me read
today's physician log?

188
00:11:27,184 --> 00:11:28,184
Did you break your hand?

189
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:33,730
Are you really that confident
in your family's ancestral skills?

190
00:11:33,884 --> 00:11:34,884
My hand isn't better yet.

191
00:11:35,537 --> 00:11:37,258
I sprained my muscle, didn't I?

192
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:39,950
Recovery from such injuries
takes at least a hundred days.

193
00:11:50,657 --> 00:11:52,770
Recovery from such injuries
takes at least a hundred days.

194
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,440
Today's log, right?

195
00:13:34,938 --> 00:13:35,977
Meng Meng.

196
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,439
Meng Meng.

197
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:38,417
It's okay.

198
00:13:39,617 --> 00:13:40,417
It's me.

199
00:13:42,177 --> 00:13:42,977
It's okay.

200
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:48,258
It's okay.

201
00:13:48,698 --> 00:13:49,537
It's okay. It's me.

202
00:13:59,498 --> 00:14:00,698
Meng Meng.

203
00:14:00,857 --> 00:14:02,577
Meng Meng, I've turned off the ringtone.

204
00:14:02,657 --> 00:14:04,777
-Meng Meng.
-Oh, no. Meng Meng.

205
00:14:12,258 --> 00:14:13,897
What happened? What happened?

206
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,738
What happened?
Mum, Dad, go back to your room.

207
00:14:17,818 --> 00:14:18,938
I'll take care of this.

208
00:14:23,338 --> 00:14:24,458
Tian Zhen, what happened?

209
00:14:32,657 --> 00:14:33,458
Seriously.

210
00:14:33,657 --> 00:14:34,938
Mum, Dad,

211
00:14:35,018 --> 00:14:35,984
go back to your room.

212
00:14:36,898 --> 00:14:37,977
Everything's fine.

213
00:14:39,097 --> 00:14:40,149
I will take care of this.

214
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,681
Mum, wake Tou Tou up.

215
00:14:45,764 --> 00:14:47,197
Ask her to sleep in the living room.

216
00:14:47,657 --> 00:14:48,617
I'll watch Meng Meng.

217
00:14:49,498 --> 00:14:50,298
Okay.

218
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,640
Go back to bed.

219
00:14:59,777 --> 00:15:00,577
Meng Meng.

220
00:15:01,264 --> 00:15:02,064
Meng Meng.

221
00:15:02,924 --> 00:15:03,724
It's okay now.

222
00:15:04,116 --> 00:15:05,397
I turned off the phone.

223
00:15:09,138 --> 00:15:09,938
Meng Meng,

224
00:15:10,084 --> 00:15:12,378
it's okay now.
There is no one else here. Just me.

225
00:15:14,338 --> 00:15:15,138
Come out.

226
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:27,857
Don't be afraid. It's okay now.

227
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:53,217
Have you woken Tou Tou up?

228
00:15:55,258 --> 00:15:57,258
She won't wake up.

229
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,240
She keeps saying she has insomnia.

230
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,639
She set such a disturbing ringtone.

231
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:05,629
I wouldn't be able to sleep too
if I heard it.

232
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:08,498
But it didn't bother her at all.

233
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,917
She is full of nonsense

234
00:16:11,998 --> 00:16:13,944
and not afraid of
causing trouble for others.

235
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,481
Don't be mad.

236
00:16:16,378 --> 00:16:17,777
Don't be mad.

237
00:16:17,898 --> 00:16:20,058
We have two patients in our home,

238
00:16:20,177 --> 00:16:22,138
and one of them is pretty good.

239
00:16:22,258 --> 00:16:23,258
This is not bad.

240
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,479
My parents,

241
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:28,630
you,

242
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,737
have always attracted patients
to our home throughout your lives.

243
00:16:31,818 --> 00:16:33,737
But I must say, I've never encountered

244
00:16:34,498 --> 00:16:36,217
patients like these two before.

245
00:16:37,258 --> 00:16:40,058
Meng Meng was brought back by your son,

246
00:16:40,138 --> 00:16:41,258
not me.

247
00:16:45,877 --> 00:16:46,677
Why do you think

248
00:16:47,258 --> 00:16:49,657
Tian Zhen is being so nice to Meng Meng?

249
00:16:49,737 --> 00:16:53,058
Doesn't this go beyond what a doctor
should do for their patients?

250
00:16:54,258 --> 00:16:55,298
Like my master said,

251
00:16:55,378 --> 00:16:58,578
Meng Meng is beautiful and wealthy.

252
00:16:58,938 --> 00:16:59,898
He has fallen for her?

253
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,960
That can't do.

254
00:17:02,177 --> 00:17:03,058
I have to

255
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:05,696
nip it in the bud.

256
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:07,697
Meng Meng is currently

257
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:08,938
so mentally unstable.

258
00:17:09,018 --> 00:17:10,957
We can't let them
spend too much time together.

259
00:17:11,737 --> 00:17:13,418
You are also a TCM professor.

260
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,560
You don't discriminate
when you treat patients,

261
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,560
but you do when you
pick your daughter-in-law.

262
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,080
The power of choice
in your life lies with me.

263
00:17:21,417 --> 00:17:23,617
Don't meddle too much in this matter.

264
00:17:24,818 --> 00:17:26,617
How am I meddling too much?

265
00:17:28,058 --> 00:17:29,857
I'm not choosing my daughter-in-law.

266
00:17:30,564 --> 00:17:31,603
I'm choosing

267
00:17:31,938 --> 00:17:33,097
my grandchild's mother.

268
00:17:34,297 --> 00:17:36,177
Give the order.

269
00:17:36,818 --> 00:17:38,258
Ask Meng Meng to move out tomorrow.

270
00:17:38,498 --> 00:17:40,418
We didn't think this through.

271
00:17:40,498 --> 00:17:42,938
It's not improper for
an unmarried man and woman

272
00:17:43,018 --> 00:17:44,338
to stay together alone in the same room.

273
00:17:44,378 --> 00:17:45,777
They are not alone.

274
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:47,297
Tou Tou is there too.

275
00:17:47,617 --> 00:17:48,698
She doesn't count.

276
00:17:50,378 --> 00:17:52,617
Tian Zhen has never taken her seriously.

277
00:17:53,304 --> 00:17:55,104
She's just like the Monkey King,
when he hadn't been enlightened yet.

278
00:17:55,258 --> 00:17:56,258
Just

279
00:17:56,498 --> 00:17:57,617
mind your own business.

280
00:17:58,617 --> 00:17:59,657
Or you'd have insomnia

281
00:17:59,737 --> 00:18:00,818
like Tou Tou.

282
00:18:00,898 --> 00:18:01,978
My son's affairs

283
00:18:02,058 --> 00:18:03,058
are my affairs.

284
00:18:03,617 --> 00:18:04,730
I have to take care of it.

285
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:06,643
Did you hear me?

286
00:18:07,417 --> 00:18:09,050
Ask Meng Meng to
leave tomorrow morning.

287
00:18:10,698 --> 00:18:11,498
Mr Ren?

288
00:18:19,617 --> 00:18:20,417
I can't sleep now.

289
00:18:55,818 --> 00:18:57,417
Wake up in the morning,

290
00:18:57,578 --> 00:18:59,137
embrace the sun.

291
00:18:59,257 --> 00:19:00,618
Let your body be filled with

292
00:19:00,897 --> 00:19:01,738
radiant sunlight.

293
00:19:01,818 --> 00:19:03,618
Change your ringtone now.

294
00:19:08,058 --> 00:19:10,137
Why are you acting up
early in the morning?

295
00:19:11,497 --> 00:19:14,216
Did you know that your ringtone
gave Meng Meng a fright last night?

296
00:19:17,297 --> 00:19:18,097
I mean,

297
00:19:18,578 --> 00:19:19,738
I'm using

298
00:19:19,818 --> 00:19:21,017
the trending ringtone,

299
00:19:21,417 --> 00:19:22,897
you know, The Standing Groundhog.

300
00:19:23,738 --> 00:19:24,538
Stop it.

301
00:19:25,777 --> 00:19:26,818
That's how it screamed.

302
00:19:27,497 --> 00:19:28,577
What's so scary about it?

303
00:19:28,657 --> 00:19:31,777
Do you know how the screaming
groundhog is eaten by the predators?

304
00:19:33,058 --> 00:19:33,977
I don't want to know.

305
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:35,058
Change it now.

306
00:19:35,537 --> 00:19:36,639
I got it.

307
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,920
When Meng Meng wakes up later,

308
00:19:38,017 --> 00:19:40,498
I'll let her choose a ringtone
she likes, okay?

309
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,599
Like that one...

310
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,417
What are you singing?

311
00:19:51,777 --> 00:19:52,577
Where is Meng Meng?

312
00:19:53,137 --> 00:19:53,996
She's still sleeping.

313
00:19:54,177 --> 00:19:56,138
Dad, Meng Meng slept late last night.

314
00:19:56,218 --> 00:19:57,457
Let her sleep a little longer.

315
00:19:57,537 --> 00:19:58,377
Wake her up.

316
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,320
A regular daily routine is necessary
for the body to function properly.

317
00:20:01,417 --> 00:20:02,217
Go and wake her up.

318
00:20:04,417 --> 00:20:05,217
Hang on,

319
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,296
she was frightened last night.
Why didn't I hear...

320
00:20:07,377 --> 00:20:08,177
Master.

321
00:20:09,818 --> 00:20:10,716
Let's have breakfast.

322
00:20:13,177 --> 00:20:14,297
It's barbecued pork bun!

323
00:20:14,537 --> 00:20:16,183
We're having
barbecued pork bun today.

324
00:20:19,417 --> 00:20:20,938
-What's wrong?
-Sit down and wait.

325
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:22,869
What I am waiting for?

326
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,309
Wait until everyone's here.

327
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,230
Wait for your elders.

328
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,200
Senior Brother!

329
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,679
Senior Brother, please.

330
00:20:31,777 --> 00:20:33,297
Master, take your seat now.

331
00:20:33,377 --> 00:20:34,938
-Grandma.
-What are you doing?

332
00:20:35,604 --> 00:20:36,404
Come.

333
00:20:37,657 --> 00:20:38,578
The elders are here.

334
00:20:38,744 --> 00:20:39,583
Can I dig in now?

335
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,760
What now?

336
00:20:46,377 --> 00:20:47,563
What is the meaning of this?

337
00:20:52,058 --> 00:20:54,137
What... What organization is this?

338
00:20:54,738 --> 00:20:55,777
The morning pulse

339
00:20:56,417 --> 00:20:59,417
accurately reflects
our body's condition.

340
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,680
This is the daily mandatory lesson
in our family.

341
00:21:01,777 --> 00:21:02,817
Put your arms out.

342
00:21:02,897 --> 00:21:04,978
Can't we have breakfast first?

343
00:21:05,058 --> 00:21:06,297
Let's read the pulse
after breakfast, okay?

344
00:21:06,377 --> 00:21:07,297
I'm starving.

345
00:21:07,377 --> 00:21:08,417
It won't be accurate then.

346
00:21:09,537 --> 00:21:10,657
Tou Tou, I'll teach you.

347
00:21:10,858 --> 00:21:11,777
Front.

348
00:21:12,858 --> 00:21:13,658
Middle.

349
00:21:14,618 --> 00:21:15,418
Rear.

350
00:21:16,137 --> 00:21:17,137
Feel it.

351
00:21:21,777 --> 00:21:22,578
Front.

352
00:21:23,098 --> 00:21:23,898
Middle.

353
00:21:24,297 --> 00:21:25,097
Rear.

354
00:21:30,938 --> 00:21:31,817
Feel any changes?

355
00:21:31,897 --> 00:21:32,697
It's beating.

356
00:21:33,818 --> 00:21:34,897
Your reading is accurate.

357
00:21:35,777 --> 00:21:36,618
I remember,

358
00:21:37,058 --> 00:21:39,577
the first time Tian Zhen
read someone's pulse when he was little,

359
00:21:39,657 --> 00:21:41,858
he said the same thing,
"It's beating."

360
00:21:43,257 --> 00:21:44,618
Tou Tou is right.

361
00:21:44,938 --> 00:21:46,458
If the pulse doesn't beat,

362
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,199
it means the person is dead.

363
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,340
Other than it's beating,

364
00:21:49,537 --> 00:21:50,646
do you feel anything else?

365
00:21:51,417 --> 00:21:52,217
Nothing.

366
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:53,777
What else can I feel?

367
00:21:54,417 --> 00:21:55,257
I feel hungry.

368
00:21:55,818 --> 00:21:57,338
I just want to eat barbecued pork bun.

369
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,119
You are just starting to learn now.

370
00:21:59,657 --> 00:22:01,097
As time goes on,

371
00:22:01,177 --> 00:22:04,497
you will be able to feel the
differences in the beating of the pulse.

372
00:22:05,058 --> 00:22:05,938
When?

373
00:22:06,978 --> 00:22:08,698
When will I feel the difference?

374
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,360
How do I know it's different?

375
00:22:10,578 --> 00:22:12,897
Everyone's pulse is unique.

376
00:22:13,137 --> 00:22:15,503
Some people may have a pulse that
is like a rapid and forceful current,

377
00:22:15,596 --> 00:22:18,030
some may have a pulse
that is like turbulent waves.

378
00:22:18,111 --> 00:22:19,320
Some may have a pulse

379
00:22:19,437 --> 00:22:21,320
that is like plucking the strings
of a musical instrument,

380
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,400
and some whose pulse is quick
and sharp like flicking a marble.

381
00:22:26,596 --> 00:22:27,396
Remember,

382
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,042
as you continue
to practice pulse reading,

383
00:22:29,123 --> 00:22:30,924
you will gradually
gain clarity and insight.

384
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,098
This is mysticism.

385
00:22:32,277 --> 00:22:33,397
Not at all.

386
00:22:34,338 --> 00:22:35,497
After reading pulses for a long time,

387
00:22:35,611 --> 00:22:38,570
when you place your fingers
on your patients' pulse,

388
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,721
you can gain insights
into their character

389
00:22:41,017 --> 00:22:42,670
and what they have been doing recently.

390
00:22:43,297 --> 00:22:46,098
Ling Lan, I can tell
what you've been up to recently.

391
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,000
You've just made

392
00:22:49,177 --> 00:22:50,257
barbecued pork buns.

393
00:22:52,443 --> 00:22:53,724
Nephew, read my pulse.

394
00:22:54,058 --> 00:22:56,417
Tell my about my character
and my recent experience.

395
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,639
There is one thing I know for sure.

396
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,720
Last night,

397
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:01,698
you must have had the best sleep.

398
00:23:01,978 --> 00:23:02,978
That's true.

399
00:23:03,058 --> 00:23:06,377
I slept really well last night.
I feel very energetic today.

400
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,760
-Come.
-Meng Meng, you got scared last night.

401
00:23:10,177 --> 00:23:10,977
Are you okay?

402
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,640
Everyone's here.

403
00:23:14,978 --> 00:23:16,337
Let's dig in. Come on.

404
00:23:16,537 --> 00:23:17,337
Senior Brother,

405
00:23:18,458 --> 00:23:19,258
please.

406
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,680
In humble fare and meagre grain,
ponder the toil to sustain.

407
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,761
Half a thread, half a strand,
cherish them in mind.

408
00:23:29,537 --> 00:23:31,818
This family has so many rules
before eating.

409
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,346
(Longevity for oneself,
longevity for the world)

410
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,920
Luo Yong Xin, the specialist

411
00:24:01,058 --> 00:24:03,303
of Hepatobiliary Department
from Wuhan People's Hospital,

412
00:24:03,384 --> 00:24:04,664
sent you here?

413
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:05,896
(Jiang Li)
That's right.

414
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,599
You have a medical insurance, right?

415
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,521
Yes.

416
00:24:09,644 --> 00:24:11,837
-Are your children staying with you?
-No.

417
00:24:11,918 --> 00:24:12,757
They are abroad.

418
00:24:14,058 --> 00:24:15,417
What about relatives?

419
00:24:16,338 --> 00:24:17,138
No.

420
00:24:17,677 --> 00:24:18,598
It's just me alone.

421
00:24:19,344 --> 00:24:20,663
You're living alone?

422
00:24:21,243 --> 00:24:22,802
Are you staying with a caretaker?

423
00:24:24,443 --> 00:24:25,323
Professor Ren,

424
00:24:25,584 --> 00:24:27,063
just be honest with me.

425
00:24:27,517 --> 00:24:28,836
Someone already told me

426
00:24:29,077 --> 00:24:29,877
that

427
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,120
if a TCM practitioner

428
00:24:31,338 --> 00:24:33,337
recommends you to see a Western doctor,

429
00:24:33,417 --> 00:24:35,698
it means your condition is severe.

430
00:24:35,938 --> 00:24:38,457
And if a Western doctor recommends
you to see a TCM practitioner,

431
00:24:38,537 --> 00:24:40,177
it means you are beyond help.

432
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:42,738
I've braced myself for it.

433
00:24:48,537 --> 00:24:51,058
Looks like Luo Yong Xin
can't cure your illness.

434
00:24:54,517 --> 00:24:55,317
I knew it.

435
00:24:56,218 --> 00:24:57,417
I figured it out.

436
00:24:58,898 --> 00:25:00,177
How much time do I have left?

437
00:25:01,243 --> 00:25:02,203
Tell me.

438
00:25:07,575 --> 00:25:08,975
He can't cure you,

439
00:25:09,056 --> 00:25:10,977
but it doesn't mean
I can't cure you too.

440
00:25:11,537 --> 00:25:12,337
You can cure me?

441
00:25:14,537 --> 00:25:16,177
Dr Luo is the top expert

442
00:25:16,257 --> 00:25:17,417
in the country

443
00:25:17,497 --> 00:25:19,457
when it comes
to treating this condition.

444
00:25:19,537 --> 00:25:20,337
Yes.

445
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,200
That's in the domain
of Western medicine.

446
00:25:22,297 --> 00:25:24,137
You haven't tried TCM's treatment yet.

447
00:25:25,256 --> 00:25:26,349
What's the treatment then?

448
00:25:27,017 --> 00:25:27,818
Drinking medicine?

449
00:25:28,004 --> 00:25:28,804
Acupuncture?

450
00:25:29,416 --> 00:25:30,936
Drinking medicine
and getting acupuncture

451
00:25:31,017 --> 00:25:34,177
are common treatment methods,

452
00:25:34,297 --> 00:25:36,417
but they can't cure
your illness for now.

453
00:25:38,163 --> 00:25:39,403
Let me ask you,

454
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:41,537
did you ever kill animals

455
00:25:42,137 --> 00:25:43,417
when you were young?

456
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:46,377
No. I'm very caring and kind.

457
00:25:46,938 --> 00:25:50,017
Chickens and geese also count.

458
00:25:51,058 --> 00:25:51,897
Do

459
00:25:52,058 --> 00:25:53,457
snails and crayfish also count?

460
00:25:53,538 --> 00:25:55,178
That's even worse.

461
00:25:55,497 --> 00:25:56,897
Think about it.

462
00:25:57,177 --> 00:25:59,457
We usually eat half of a chicken

463
00:25:59,537 --> 00:26:02,457
or half a goose in a meal.

464
00:26:02,537 --> 00:26:03,978
As for crayfish

465
00:26:04,537 --> 00:26:05,577
and snails,

466
00:26:05,657 --> 00:26:06,898
we probably eat

467
00:26:06,978 --> 00:26:08,657
dozens or hundreds of them in a meal.

468
00:26:10,818 --> 00:26:11,938
In that case,

469
00:26:12,537 --> 00:26:14,097
I've really killed a lot then.

470
00:26:14,177 --> 00:26:15,364
There was a period of time

471
00:26:15,738 --> 00:26:17,457
when my spouse was in poor health.

472
00:26:17,663 --> 00:26:19,138
To treat his illness,

473
00:26:19,231 --> 00:26:21,030
I had to slaughter
two pigeons every day.

474
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:22,697
As for snails and crayfish,

475
00:26:22,777 --> 00:26:23,817
I ate a lot of them

476
00:26:23,897 --> 00:26:25,137
in a year.

477
00:26:25,497 --> 00:26:26,897
You see, you see,

478
00:26:27,058 --> 00:26:28,177
these actions

479
00:26:28,777 --> 00:26:30,738
are considered
as accumulating karmic obstacles.

480
00:26:33,017 --> 00:26:35,017
All lives are equal.

481
00:26:36,058 --> 00:26:38,777
All these grudges of life

482
00:26:39,017 --> 00:26:41,337
seem to have concentrated on you alone.

483
00:26:41,417 --> 00:26:42,698
That's why I asked

484
00:26:43,537 --> 00:26:45,858
if you are staying with your relatives.

485
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:47,217
If you are,

486
00:26:47,297 --> 00:26:49,897
ask one of them to travel with you.

487
00:26:50,377 --> 00:26:52,137
There are so many mountains

488
00:26:52,417 --> 00:26:54,417
and rivers in our country,

489
00:26:54,497 --> 00:26:56,017
why don't you go visit them?

490
00:26:56,537 --> 00:26:58,897
You can also go to temples
and offer incense.

491
00:26:59,297 --> 00:27:00,383
That's all you need to do.

492
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,520
That's it?

493
00:27:06,297 --> 00:27:07,097
No.

494
00:27:07,177 --> 00:27:08,777
I checked your blood pressure,

495
00:27:08,897 --> 00:27:10,297
and it's not very stable.

496
00:27:10,618 --> 00:27:11,897
I will prescribe some medicine

497
00:27:12,377 --> 00:27:13,897
to help stabilize your mood

498
00:27:15,017 --> 00:27:17,098
and improve your sleep.

499
00:27:20,436 --> 00:27:22,577
Just show them this prescription.

500
00:27:22,657 --> 00:27:24,297
They will collect the herbs for you.

501
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,480
Come.

502
00:27:26,897 --> 00:27:27,697
Come.

503
00:27:28,051 --> 00:27:29,450
Just go to him.

504
00:27:30,978 --> 00:27:32,498
Master! Master!

505
00:27:32,657 --> 00:27:33,457
Master.

506
00:27:33,738 --> 00:27:34,738
Master, I...

507
00:27:35,017 --> 00:27:36,043
I'd like to take leave.

508
00:27:36,537 --> 00:27:37,417
Why?

509
00:27:37,537 --> 00:27:38,538
You mentioned

510
00:27:38,618 --> 00:27:40,697
about the mountains and rivers.

511
00:27:40,777 --> 00:27:41,897
I'd like to visit a temple
and pay respect too.

512
00:27:44,671 --> 00:27:47,017
I ate more crayfish
than Grandma Jiang did.

513
00:27:47,897 --> 00:27:48,697
Really.

514
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:50,640
-About the karmic obstacles...
-Mr Ren.

515
00:27:51,137 --> 00:27:52,457
Xu Meng's medicinal herbs
have been collected.

516
00:27:52,537 --> 00:27:54,657
Would you like to decoct it here
or at home?

517
00:27:55,297 --> 00:27:57,417
There is Aconite in it.
The fire must be kept on all time.

518
00:27:57,497 --> 00:27:58,377
Got it.

519
00:27:58,657 --> 00:28:00,497
Master, I will decoct
Meng Meng's medicine.

520
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,497
-I will decoct it this evening.
-How diligent.

521
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,720
But you need to give me my phone.

522
00:28:08,818 --> 00:28:10,064
I need to look at the time.

523
00:28:10,257 --> 00:28:11,177
I don't want

524
00:28:11,469 --> 00:28:12,429
to overboil it.

525
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:17,777
Fine. I will give you back your phone
when you decoct it.

526
00:28:19,796 --> 00:28:21,676
About my leave...

527
00:28:23,137 --> 00:28:25,058
You're ignoring my trouble.

528
00:28:26,017 --> 00:28:27,537
I'm a successor.

529
00:28:28,058 --> 00:28:29,698
I have a lot of karmic obstacles.

530
00:28:34,897 --> 00:28:35,777
Hello, Mum.

531
00:28:36,223 --> 00:28:37,744
(Quan, how have you been?)

532
00:28:38,657 --> 00:28:40,057
(Have you been eating well?)

533
00:28:40,207 --> 00:28:41,528
(Are you dressed warmly?)

534
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:43,169
How's your work?

535
00:28:43,497 --> 00:28:45,017
Did your teacher compliment you?

536
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,329
Don't worry about me, Mum.
I'm doing great.

537
00:28:49,257 --> 00:28:52,177
By the way, Mum, I recently checked
the weather forecast for my hometown.

538
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,216
It seems that there have been
several days of heavy rain.

539
00:28:54,297 --> 00:28:55,938
How are Dad's legs?

540
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:57,577
He's fine.

541
00:28:57,777 --> 00:28:58,817
It didn't affect our work.

542
00:28:58,963 --> 00:28:59,763
Don't worry.

543
00:29:01,677 --> 00:29:02,477
Quan,

544
00:29:02,817 --> 00:29:05,417
Dragon Boat Festival is coming soon.

545
00:29:06,017 --> 00:29:07,217
Your dad and I

546
00:29:07,297 --> 00:29:09,858
have been entrusted
by the entire village

547
00:29:10,216 --> 00:29:12,097
(to bring you some delicious food.)

548
00:29:12,177 --> 00:29:13,698
Mum, you don't have to come.

549
00:29:14,297 --> 00:29:16,497
There is no need for the trouble.
I'm doing great here.

550
00:29:17,177 --> 00:29:18,337
(Don't worry.)

551
00:29:18,417 --> 00:29:19,417
The secretary

552
00:29:19,497 --> 00:29:21,377
even bought us train tickets.

553
00:29:21,657 --> 00:29:23,938
We've got to visit the city.

554
00:29:26,257 --> 00:29:27,817
You really don't have to come, Mum.

555
00:29:27,897 --> 00:29:29,538
I can take good care of myself here.

556
00:29:29,618 --> 00:29:30,618
Do you hear me?

557
00:29:32,443 --> 00:29:33,243
Hello?

558
00:29:47,377 --> 00:29:48,337
You're finally here.

559
00:29:48,417 --> 00:29:49,497
Look at the time now.

560
00:29:50,058 --> 00:29:52,098
You've missed two
follow-up appointments before.

561
00:29:52,657 --> 00:29:54,017
My master is going to nag you.

562
00:29:54,777 --> 00:29:55,577
Hang on,

563
00:29:55,889 --> 00:29:57,610
what's going on with you this time?

564
00:29:58,897 --> 00:30:00,417
She looks really pale.

565
00:30:00,497 --> 00:30:01,297
Let me see.

566
00:30:01,537 --> 00:30:02,916
You didn't get much rest, did you?

567
00:30:03,017 --> 00:30:03,978
I've had too much

568
00:30:04,738 --> 00:30:05,897
going on lately.

569
00:30:07,177 --> 00:30:08,496
(Cheng Ying)
Everything is a mess.

570
00:30:08,657 --> 00:30:10,603
I don't have any mood
to come for follow-up treatment.

571
00:30:12,216 --> 00:30:13,016
Madam,

572
00:30:13,938 --> 00:30:15,624
you are responsible for your own health.

573
00:30:15,738 --> 00:30:16,538
If you don't take it seriously,

574
00:30:16,578 --> 00:30:18,111
no one else will
take it seriously for you.

575
00:30:21,777 --> 00:30:23,217
You still have
excessive menstrual bleeding.

576
00:30:23,297 --> 00:30:24,516
Have you taken your medicine?

577
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:27,037
My health...

578
00:30:29,618 --> 00:30:31,537
No one cares about me now.

579
00:30:32,537 --> 00:30:33,618
What's wrong?

580
00:30:34,177 --> 00:30:35,098
I...

581
00:30:35,537 --> 00:30:37,777
My life is completely
out of control now.

582
00:30:38,257 --> 00:30:39,657
My husband is having an affair

583
00:30:40,738 --> 00:30:42,537
and insisting on getting a divorce.

584
00:30:50,537 --> 00:30:52,458
Is anyone there? Please give us a hand.

585
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,513
Madam Zhu, are you here
for her follow-up appointment?

586
00:30:57,537 --> 00:30:59,377
She said her legs feel cold.

587
00:30:59,657 --> 00:31:00,697
I was so overjoyed

588
00:31:00,876 --> 00:31:02,297
that I almost shed tears.

589
00:31:02,377 --> 00:31:04,390
So, I came to ask
Professor Ren to check on her.

590
00:31:04,777 --> 00:31:05,577
We will go in first.

591
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:06,538
Okay.

592
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:12,213
(Qibo Medical Centre)

593
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,897
There is a crazy woman who is suing me.

594
00:31:17,017 --> 00:31:19,018
She is giving me trouble at my workplace

595
00:31:19,098 --> 00:31:20,897
and in court.

596
00:31:21,657 --> 00:31:23,858
She is driving me crazy.

597
00:31:24,777 --> 00:31:27,657
My son is still so little.
No one can take care of him.

598
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:29,760
Cheng Ying!

599
00:31:33,497 --> 00:31:34,297
Who are you?

600
00:31:40,297 --> 00:31:41,738
Meng Meng, are you okay?

601
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,817
No fighting.

602
00:31:47,657 --> 00:31:48,457
Mum!

603
00:31:51,297 --> 00:31:52,097
Mum!

604
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:05,611
Stop fighting!

605
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,120
They are enemies
who run into each other here.

606
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,239
Xia, calm down.

607
00:32:11,677 --> 00:32:12,477
Doctor...

608
00:32:40,537 --> 00:32:41,417
Quiet, quiet.

609
00:32:44,058 --> 00:32:46,177
It was an accident.

610
00:32:48,818 --> 00:32:50,897
I really didn't mean to do it.

611
00:32:51,297 --> 00:32:55,360
I... I really wish it was me
who got hit.

612
00:32:56,417 --> 00:32:58,263
That's enough.
Do you really want to die?

613
00:32:59,764 --> 00:33:00,644
Quiet, quiet.

614
00:33:05,897 --> 00:33:06,897
Professor Ren,

615
00:33:07,571 --> 00:33:10,090
do you remember
when I told you last time

616
00:33:11,017 --> 00:33:13,360
that I suspected my husband
was having an affair?

617
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,240
(Two months ago)

618
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,160
Professor Ren,

619
00:33:19,897 --> 00:33:21,338
is my condition treatable?

620
00:33:21,738 --> 00:33:23,017
30 days in a month,

621
00:33:23,377 --> 00:33:24,897
and I have been bleeding for 28 days.

622
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,313
It's really starting
to take a toll on me.

623
00:33:28,897 --> 00:33:30,137
Is it untreatable?

624
00:33:33,738 --> 00:33:35,137
Actually, your condition

625
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,040
isn't serious.

626
00:33:37,297 --> 00:33:38,937
It's just that the treatment takes time.

627
00:33:39,938 --> 00:33:41,338
This isn't serious?

628
00:33:43,017 --> 00:33:45,217
I started suffering from this
shortly after giving birth to my child.

629
00:33:45,297 --> 00:33:46,657
My son is four years old.

630
00:33:47,137 --> 00:33:48,818
I've been seeking treatment for
my illness for two and a half years.

631
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,160
I have seen many doctors
and taken numerous medications,

632
00:33:51,257 --> 00:33:53,183
but so far, there hasn't been
much improvement.

633
00:33:53,497 --> 00:33:54,738
I have told you before

634
00:33:54,818 --> 00:33:56,218
that in order to cure your illness,

635
00:33:56,257 --> 00:33:58,337
your husband must undergo
the treatment with you.

636
00:33:58,417 --> 00:34:00,296
Tell your husband
to come with you next time.

637
00:34:01,738 --> 00:34:03,137
He won't listen to me.

638
00:34:03,897 --> 00:34:04,698
Professor Ren,

639
00:34:06,657 --> 00:34:08,537
I suspect that
he is cheating on me now.

640
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,339
What do you want to do then?

641
00:34:22,137 --> 00:34:22,937
Take some medicine.

642
00:34:24,897 --> 00:34:26,578
I think if you want to get better,

643
00:34:26,777 --> 00:34:29,137
you mustn't be paranoid.

644
00:34:30,618 --> 00:34:32,737
How about this?
Go and collect your medicine first.

645
00:34:44,137 --> 00:34:45,350
Here's your birthday present.

646
00:34:47,943 --> 00:34:49,136
Aren't you going to open it?

647
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,257
My hands are tied. Le Le!

648
00:34:54,137 --> 00:34:55,137
Breakfast is ready!

649
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,240
What do you think? Do you like it?

650
00:35:28,938 --> 00:35:30,698
I didn't know Ferrari made wallets.

651
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,680
These are derived products
of high-end brands.

652
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:34,236
Hermes even sells lipsticks.

653
00:35:35,417 --> 00:35:36,497
Le Le, hurry up.

654
00:35:36,777 --> 00:35:38,177
Le Le, hurry up.

655
00:35:38,657 --> 00:35:39,457
Hurry.

656
00:35:41,137 --> 00:35:43,338
We're having dinner
at my parents' place tonight.

657
00:35:43,658 --> 00:35:44,737
Get off work early.

658
00:35:45,138 --> 00:35:46,217
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

659
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,640
I have an appointment
with a client tonight.

660
00:35:47,737 --> 00:35:49,457
Start the dinner without me.
I'll come later.

661
00:35:49,537 --> 00:35:50,457
Let's go. Hurry up.

662
00:35:50,537 --> 00:35:51,337
Come on.

663
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:00,969
Hello, honey.

664
00:36:01,537 --> 00:36:03,218
I received your wine. Thank you.

665
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,577
Why are you being so polite with me?

666
00:36:05,658 --> 00:36:06,497
I'm telling you,

667
00:36:06,777 --> 00:36:08,178
it wasn't easy to buy this wine.

668
00:36:08,898 --> 00:36:09,776
I know.

669
00:36:10,058 --> 00:36:12,017
My husband has been trying to find it.

670
00:36:12,658 --> 00:36:14,378
What's going on? You guys made up?

671
00:36:15,017 --> 00:36:16,377
Not exactly.

672
00:36:16,457 --> 00:36:18,578
That's just life.
There are good days and bad days.

673
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,759
All married couples are like this.

674
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,441
Why did you buy him
such expensive wine?

675
00:36:22,017 --> 00:36:23,983
It's your birthday,
but you're giving him a gift.

676
00:36:24,736 --> 00:36:26,176
He gave me a wallet too.

677
00:36:26,297 --> 00:36:27,378
From Ferrari.

678
00:36:28,898 --> 00:36:29,898
(What the hell?)

679
00:36:30,818 --> 00:36:32,697
It's a specially customized edition.

680
00:36:32,777 --> 00:36:34,383
You don't know they have this, do you?

681
00:36:34,858 --> 00:36:35,937
Fine, fine. I don't know.

682
00:36:36,898 --> 00:36:38,017
Remember,

683
00:36:38,338 --> 00:36:40,017
keep showing off your love
might lead to a break-up sooner.

684
00:36:45,098 --> 00:36:45,898
What do you think?

685
00:36:46,058 --> 00:36:47,098
Do you like your car?

686
00:36:47,178 --> 00:36:48,058
Yes.

687
00:36:48,138 --> 00:36:49,177
Thanks, honey.

688
00:36:49,257 --> 00:36:50,138
I'm glad you liked it.

689
00:36:50,578 --> 00:36:52,578
How about taking me for a ride later?

690
00:36:52,777 --> 00:36:53,577
Sure.

691
00:37:23,737 --> 00:37:26,018
I didn't mean to hit her.

692
00:37:26,098 --> 00:37:28,017
I already told her that.

693
00:37:29,338 --> 00:37:31,017
It wasn't my intention.

694
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:35,999
Professor Ren.

695
00:37:40,578 --> 00:37:42,017
What brings you to my school?

696
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,240
-I...
-What's wrong?

697
00:37:43,338 --> 00:37:45,017
I think I'm losing it.

698
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:46,641
Professor Ren,

699
00:37:47,138 --> 00:37:48,658
you have to help me.

700
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,153
Where is your husband?

701
00:37:52,178 --> 00:37:53,937
He is cheating on me.

702
00:37:54,682 --> 00:37:56,443
I saw it with my own eyes.

703
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,764
I saw it with my own eyes.

704
00:38:00,764 --> 00:38:02,577
Calm down, okay?

705
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,840
Professor Ren,

706
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,560
I'm losing all my blood.

707
00:38:10,858 --> 00:38:12,058
Am I dying soon?

708
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,121
Don't say that.

709
00:38:15,017 --> 00:38:16,618
It's not that easy to die.

710
00:38:17,658 --> 00:38:19,697
Have you taken the medicine
I prescribed for you?

711
00:38:20,378 --> 00:38:21,338
No.

712
00:38:21,717 --> 00:38:24,856
I... I forgot to take it this week.

713
00:38:24,937 --> 00:38:27,457
You have no idea
how terrible my life has been.

714
00:38:31,457 --> 00:38:33,336
She is a murderer!

715
00:38:33,556 --> 00:38:35,756
She has ruined my daughter's life!

716
00:38:35,997 --> 00:38:37,565
She must be sentenced to death!

717
00:38:38,444 --> 00:38:40,284
I didn't do it on purpose.

718
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,641
And what did you do to me?

719
00:38:41,885 --> 00:38:43,404
You're stalking me

720
00:38:43,565 --> 00:38:44,684
like a lunatic.

721
00:38:44,765 --> 00:38:46,644
She follows me to my workplace,

722
00:38:46,724 --> 00:38:47,805
to my home.

723
00:38:47,885 --> 00:38:50,178
She even posts defamatory messages
about me online.

724
00:38:50,565 --> 00:38:53,565
You're driving me crazy, you know?

725
00:38:53,988 --> 00:38:55,028
-You're going crazy?
-Officers!

726
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:57,111
-I'm the one who's going crazy!
-What are you doing?

727
00:39:06,165 --> 00:39:09,284
He bought a luxury car for his mistress.

728
00:39:09,924 --> 00:39:11,605
On my birthday,

729
00:39:11,805 --> 00:39:13,725
he gave me the gift
that came with the car

730
00:39:13,805 --> 00:39:15,924
as my birthday present.

731
00:39:16,637 --> 00:39:18,877
You need to control your emotions.

732
00:39:21,004 --> 00:39:23,085
If you lose control of your emotions,

733
00:39:23,348 --> 00:39:25,524
even if I give you acupuncture
or medication,

734
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,480
it can only treat your body,

735
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:28,845
not your mind.

736
00:39:29,484 --> 00:39:30,605
You hate your husband.

737
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,634
Your hatred will harm your heart,
you know?

738
00:39:34,885 --> 00:39:36,605
The heart governs the blood vessels.

739
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:40,198
If your blood vessels are damaged,
how can your menstrual cycle improve?

740
00:39:41,005 --> 00:39:42,925
But now every time I close my eyes,

741
00:39:42,988 --> 00:39:44,907
I see my husband and his mistress.

742
00:39:45,125 --> 00:39:46,884
I think about my poor son

743
00:39:46,964 --> 00:39:49,165
who is going to lose his father
at such a young age.

744
00:39:49,325 --> 00:39:50,405
All right now.

745
00:39:51,004 --> 00:39:52,525
You need to calm down.

746
00:39:52,605 --> 00:39:54,004
Stay calm.

747
00:39:54,365 --> 00:39:55,444
Take a nap.

748
00:39:56,908 --> 00:39:57,869
God

749
00:39:58,244 --> 00:40:00,004
must have left you a way out,

750
00:40:00,885 --> 00:40:03,524
but you have to find it yourself.

751
00:40:04,365 --> 00:40:05,165
Do you understand?

752
00:40:06,511 --> 00:40:07,352
I have caused

753
00:40:07,548 --> 00:40:10,028
another trouble now.

754
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:12,444
Where is my way out?

755
00:40:18,325 --> 00:40:19,325
Go to the front.

756
00:40:19,565 --> 00:40:20,565
I will stay with her.

757
00:40:27,325 --> 00:40:28,845
All right now. Don't cry.

758
00:40:29,484 --> 00:40:31,605
You see, we've performed
acupuncture for you.

759
00:40:34,325 --> 00:40:35,644
Thank you.

760
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:36,845
It's okay.

761
00:40:37,125 --> 00:40:39,085
-It's okay.
-Thank you.

762
00:40:39,165 --> 00:40:40,125
It's okay.

763
00:40:40,524 --> 00:40:41,324
It's okay.

764
00:40:43,125 --> 00:40:44,085
It's okay now.

765
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:46,284
Mum.

766
00:40:47,948 --> 00:40:49,500
It's okay, Meng Meng.
Don't be afraid.

767
00:40:50,924 --> 00:40:52,125
That scared me.

768
00:40:53,988 --> 00:40:54,868
Are you okay?

769
00:40:54,988 --> 00:40:55,828
I'm fine.

770
00:40:56,045 --> 00:40:56,845
Professor Ren,

771
00:40:57,325 --> 00:40:58,404
you shouldn't save her.

772
00:40:58,484 --> 00:41:00,004
You should have just let her die.

773
00:41:08,524 --> 00:41:09,324
She's dead.

774
00:41:10,512 --> 00:41:11,312
She just died.

775
00:41:12,764 --> 00:41:14,417
A car will come and take her away later.

776
00:41:17,805 --> 00:41:18,605
It's okay.

777
00:41:19,924 --> 00:41:21,757
Take her to the back
and let her rest.

778
00:41:22,484 --> 00:41:23,405
Don't worry. It's okay.

779
00:41:38,244 --> 00:41:39,044
She's dead.

780
00:41:39,817 --> 00:41:41,057
What are you going to do now?

781
00:41:44,988 --> 00:41:46,227
I think

782
00:41:48,045 --> 00:41:49,845
you're going to get sued.

783
00:41:51,405 --> 00:41:52,965
Everyone saw it just now.

784
00:41:53,045 --> 00:41:55,004
You had a fight with her
before she died.

785
00:41:55,778 --> 00:41:58,051
You had a fight with her
in the courtroom this morning.

786
00:41:59,284 --> 00:42:01,565
Her husband and her child
won't let you off the hook.

787
00:42:02,198 --> 00:42:03,611
You will have to compensate them.

788
00:42:04,764 --> 00:42:06,165
How much money do you have now?

789
00:42:09,325 --> 00:42:10,924
I'm asking you.

790
00:42:15,325 --> 00:42:16,125
Tian Zhen,

791
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:17,844
go and give her family a call.

792
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,120
Ask him to bring their child
to see her off one last time.

793
00:42:20,188 --> 00:42:20,988
Okay.

794
00:42:21,805 --> 00:42:22,605
Professor Ren.

795
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:26,092
Holding onto me won't help you.

796
00:42:30,405 --> 00:42:31,205
Master,

797
00:42:31,788 --> 00:42:34,047
I just saw a dead person
for the first time in my life.

798
00:42:36,628 --> 00:42:38,227
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

799
00:42:38,308 --> 00:42:39,708

traditional Chinese medicine books)
