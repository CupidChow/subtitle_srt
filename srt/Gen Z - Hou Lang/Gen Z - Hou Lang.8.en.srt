1
00:00:04,566 --> 00:00:06,123
Picture it in your mind.

2
00:00:06,206 --> 00:00:08,727
Imagine the Big Dipper

3
00:00:09,406 --> 00:00:10,967
as a clock.

4
00:00:12,527 --> 00:00:15,724
When the Big Dipper points to Chen,

5
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:17,025
it's the time of Grain Rain.

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,047
-Chen?
-That's right.

7
00:00:20,785 --> 00:00:21,785
What time is that?

8
00:00:22,487 --> 00:00:23,846
From 7am to 9am,

9
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,641
when you have breakfast.

10
00:00:26,846 --> 00:00:28,404
But why is it called Grain Rain?

11
00:00:28,487 --> 00:00:29,487
It's not raining here.

12
00:00:30,247 --> 00:00:32,007
It will rain at night.

13
00:00:32,953 --> 00:00:35,192
Grain Rain brings rain,

14
00:00:35,766 --> 00:00:36,964
indicating a good harvest.

15
00:00:37,047 --> 00:00:38,566
This year is bound

16
00:00:38,807 --> 00:00:40,246
to be a year of good harvest.

17
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,994
Did you predict this
through fortune-telling?

18
00:00:49,726 --> 00:00:51,487
Our ancestors told me.

19
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,920
In the city,

20
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,561
we are always busy with our works.

21
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,601
We have forgotten
to look up at the stars.

22
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,430
Liu Ci Xin wrote a novel series called
Remembrance of Earth's Past.

23
00:01:25,327 --> 00:01:27,826
It tells the story of Earth's
inhabitants transforming

24
00:01:28,613 --> 00:01:29,811
the planet into a supercollider

25
00:01:29,894 --> 00:01:31,374
hundreds of years in the future.

26
00:01:32,085 --> 00:01:34,825
When they are ready to carry out
collective interstellar travel,

27
00:01:35,713 --> 00:01:37,546
their plans are disrupted
by cosmic envoys.

28
00:01:38,177 --> 00:01:39,177
People ask the envoys

29
00:01:39,803 --> 00:01:42,698
when they first noticed their plans,

30
00:01:44,698 --> 00:01:45,817
the envoys respond

31
00:01:47,497 --> 00:01:49,217
that it began 370,000 years ago

32
00:01:50,497 --> 00:01:53,457
when ten primitive humans
looked up at the stars with wonder.

33
00:01:56,497 --> 00:01:59,454
When we learn to appreciate the beauty
that is unrelated to survival,

34
00:02:00,618 --> 00:02:02,618
and when we have curiosity
about all things,

35
00:02:04,177 --> 00:02:05,656
we become the spirit of the Earth.

36
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,560
This can fit...

37
00:02:28,457 --> 00:02:30,297
Can I take the top bunk?

38
00:02:30,737 --> 00:02:32,177
Can I take the top bunk?

39
00:02:32,937 --> 00:02:33,937
Allow me.

40
00:02:35,457 --> 00:02:38,218
Don't put your bags on the bed.
It's dirty. Take it down.

41
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,360
You mean this?

42
00:02:41,297 --> 00:02:42,297
Slow down.

43
00:02:44,937 --> 00:02:45,734
Here, Tian Zhen.

44
00:02:45,817 --> 00:02:47,138
Mum, let me help you.
Let me.

45
00:02:47,778 --> 00:02:49,898
Meng Meng, can I take the top bunk?

46
00:02:50,491 --> 00:02:51,491
Tou Tou,

47
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,054
you must wash up
before going to bed in the future.

48
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,317
You shouldn't just
get into bed like that.

49
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,400
I know.

50
00:02:57,778 --> 00:02:58,778
Unbelievable.

51
00:03:01,418 --> 00:03:03,815
This is the only room left in our house.

52
00:03:03,898 --> 00:03:05,094
You two will stay together

53
00:03:05,177 --> 00:03:06,537
and look after each other.

54
00:03:07,138 --> 00:03:08,454
I will look after Meng Meng.

55
00:03:08,537 --> 00:03:09,978
Don't worry, Meng Meng.

56
00:03:10,258 --> 00:03:11,117
I'm not sleeping.

57
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,857
I will definitely protect you

58
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,481
in every way possible.

59
00:03:15,258 --> 00:03:17,178
Mum, Sun Tou Tou is unreliable.

60
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,615
Let me take care of Meng Meng.

61
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:19,597
Listen to yourself.

62
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,948
What do you mean I'm unreliable?

63
00:03:21,031 --> 00:03:24,520
Do you know that my credibility
is what sustains me out there?

64
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,797
You had lost

65
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,775
your credibility

66
00:03:26,858 --> 00:03:28,258
from the moment we first met.

67
00:03:28,524 --> 00:03:29,524
Tian Zhen,

68
00:03:30,184 --> 00:03:31,224
go back to your room.

69
00:03:31,338 --> 00:03:32,338
Go back to your room.

70
00:03:33,484 --> 00:03:34,484
I declare that

71
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,280
starting from today,

72
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,695
our home will have separate
male and female bedrooms.

73
00:03:39,778 --> 00:03:41,017
No one is allowed

74
00:03:41,858 --> 00:03:43,554
to enter each other's rooms after 10pm.

75
00:03:44,398 --> 00:03:45,398
Is that clear?

76
00:03:49,138 --> 00:03:50,978
What about you and my nephew?

77
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,320
Your nephew?

78
00:03:52,978 --> 00:03:53,978
Your husband.

79
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,960
Does it concern you?

80
00:03:58,051 --> 00:03:59,704
Are you going to sleep separately too?

81
00:04:02,037 --> 00:04:03,596
We have another rule in our home.

82
00:04:03,858 --> 00:04:06,178
After 10pm, everyone's phones
should be placed

83
00:04:06,304 --> 00:04:07,696
in the living room for charging.

84
00:04:07,784 --> 00:04:09,103
No phones in the bedroom.

85
00:04:10,536 --> 00:04:13,004
This way, we can avoid radiation

86
00:04:13,377 --> 00:04:15,017
and have a peaceful rest.

87
00:04:15,778 --> 00:04:17,058
Not including me, right?

88
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,281
Especially you.

89
00:04:19,597 --> 00:04:20,957
I can't sleep without my phone.

90
00:04:21,378 --> 00:04:22,677
Many people nowadays

91
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,077
have trouble falling asleep
because they play with their phones.

92
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,473
I have to listen to stories
before I sleep.

93
00:04:26,556 --> 00:04:28,383
Usually, it's the mother
who tells stories.

94
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,388
I don't have a mother,

95
00:04:29,471 --> 00:04:30,433
so I have to

96
00:04:30,516 --> 00:04:32,614
play some stories on my phone

97
00:04:32,697 --> 00:04:33,697
to help me sleep.

98
00:04:33,977 --> 00:04:35,157
You are an adult now.

99
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,463
It's time to say goodbye to your mother
and sleep on your own.

100
00:04:37,546 --> 00:04:38,826
Are you stupid?

101
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,591
We are on the same side on this issue.

102
00:04:41,898 --> 00:04:43,257
I have a mother.

103
00:05:00,378 --> 00:05:01,378
Sun Tou Tou.

104
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,840
I was messing with you.

105
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You see,

106
00:05:08,257 --> 00:05:10,040
you're just exhausting yourself
like this.

107
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,037
Every day you exhaust yourself

108
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,440
until you're completely drained
before going to bed.

109
00:05:14,538 --> 00:05:16,177
This is a vicious cycle.

110
00:05:16,297 --> 00:05:17,297
I'm talking to you.

111
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,841
To have a good night's sleep,

112
00:05:21,058 --> 00:05:23,297
you shouldn't bring your phone
into the bedroom.

113
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,281
I can't control myself.

114
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,359
You can learn to control yourself.

115
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:29,761
From now on,

116
00:05:29,844 --> 00:05:30,844
don't cross your legs.

117
00:05:32,257 --> 00:05:33,577
Sit up. Sit up.

118
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,395
Start from the Guiding Technique.

119
00:05:36,778 --> 00:05:37,778
Sit up.

120
00:05:40,457 --> 00:05:43,137
Place your hands on Shanzhong acupoint.

121
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,801
That's right. Follow the Ren Meridian.

122
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:47,138
Go down.

123
00:05:48,137 --> 00:05:49,177
Good.

124
00:05:49,538 --> 00:05:52,778
Place your right palm

125
00:05:53,337 --> 00:05:54,858
over your navel.

126
00:05:55,483 --> 00:05:56,524
Cover it

127
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,770
with your left palm.

128
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,240
Start rubbing it

129
00:06:01,297 --> 00:06:02,577
counterclockwise.

130
00:06:03,817 --> 00:06:05,137
Counterclockwise.

131
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,360
Counter...

132
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:09,898
Counterclockwise.

133
00:06:11,457 --> 00:06:12,457
That's right.

134
00:06:12,577 --> 00:06:14,137
Rotate 25 times.

135
00:06:15,177 --> 00:06:16,257
Relax your shoulders.

136
00:06:17,517 --> 00:06:18,735
Maintain a straight posture.

137
00:06:18,857 --> 00:06:19,774
Continue massaging in this manner.

138
00:06:19,857 --> 00:06:22,857
Massage 25 times
before going to bed every night.

139
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:26,960
Have you learned how to do it, Meng Meng?

140
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,757
She knows how to do it now, Mum.

141
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,840
Good.

142
00:06:30,103 --> 00:06:31,243
Come on, Tian Zhen.

143
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,724
I will leave her to you.

144
00:07:57,282 --> 00:07:58,369
Have you settled them in?

145
00:07:58,970 --> 00:07:59,970
I always finished

146
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,040
the tasks you instructed me to do.

147
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:06,618
Give me your hand.

148
00:08:13,423 --> 00:08:14,781
I could tell from your eating posture

149
00:08:14,864 --> 00:08:16,494
that there is an issue with your hand.

150
00:08:16,577 --> 00:08:17,577
I

151
00:08:17,977 --> 00:08:19,697
strained my muscle while lifting

152
00:08:19,938 --> 00:08:20,938
the heavy pot today.

153
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,759
You lifted

154
00:08:27,137 --> 00:08:28,857
such a big pot with just one hand.

155
00:08:29,711 --> 00:08:31,015
Do you think you're Wu Song?

156
00:08:31,098 --> 00:08:33,377
I couldn't let it fall
on Li Quan's head, could it?

157
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,178
I think the one you're worried about
is Sun Tou Tou.

158
00:08:36,384 --> 00:08:38,384
If she didn't always cause trouble,

159
00:08:38,538 --> 00:08:40,215
you wouldn't have ended up like this.

160
00:08:40,298 --> 00:08:43,374
Why do you always blame
everything on Sun Tou Tou?

161
00:08:43,457 --> 00:08:45,898
Don't deny that you favour her.

162
00:08:46,696 --> 00:08:48,497
You've never been this patient

163
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,041
to your students,

164
00:08:50,131 --> 00:08:51,691
not even with your own son.

165
00:08:52,978 --> 00:08:55,098
You treat her like
she's the apple of your eye.

166
00:08:57,457 --> 00:08:58,978
You're going overboard.

167
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,723
As the head of the household,

168
00:09:17,497 --> 00:09:18,617
you have to be righteous

169
00:09:19,057 --> 00:09:20,623
and set an example for the children.

170
00:09:21,418 --> 00:09:22,414
Did you

171
00:09:22,497 --> 00:09:23,858
leave the phone case downstairs

172
00:09:24,057 --> 00:09:25,492
and disguise it as a phone again?

173
00:09:26,057 --> 00:09:27,335
As the head of the household,

174
00:09:27,418 --> 00:09:29,137
can't I have some privileges?

175
00:09:29,978 --> 00:09:30,978
Besides,

176
00:09:31,418 --> 00:09:33,018
I'm not like those kids

177
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:35,209
who play games and watch TikTok

178
00:09:35,418 --> 00:09:36,414
on their phones.

179
00:09:36,497 --> 00:09:38,775
All this burning the midnight oil

180
00:09:38,858 --> 00:09:41,057
and straining my eyes
is all for your sake.

181
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,400
Yes, yes.

182
00:09:43,257 --> 00:09:44,257
Yes.

183
00:09:44,858 --> 00:09:47,858
Madam Song, who has the privilege,

184
00:09:48,144 --> 00:09:48,997
can you

185
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,599
please help me read
today's physician log?

186
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:53,068
Did you break your hand?

187
00:09:54,298 --> 00:09:58,570
Are you really that confident
in your family's ancestral skills?

188
00:09:58,724 --> 00:09:59,811
My hand isn't better yet.

189
00:10:00,377 --> 00:10:02,098
I sprained my muscle, didn't I?

190
00:10:02,538 --> 00:10:05,017
Recovery from such injuries
takes at least a hundred days.

191
00:10:15,497 --> 00:10:17,976
Recovery from such injuries
takes at least a hundred days.

192
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,280
Today's log, right?

193
00:11:59,778 --> 00:12:00,797
Meng Meng.

194
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,279
Meng Meng.

195
00:12:02,457 --> 00:12:03,457
It's okay.

196
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:05,457
It's me.

197
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:08,017
It's okay.

198
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:13,298
It's okay.

199
00:12:13,538 --> 00:12:14,538
It's okay. It's me.

200
00:12:24,338 --> 00:12:25,538
Meng Meng.

201
00:12:25,697 --> 00:12:27,414
Meng Meng, I've turned off the ringtone.

202
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:29,617
-Meng Meng.
-Oh, no. Meng Meng.

203
00:12:37,098 --> 00:12:38,737
What happened? What happened?

204
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,575
What happened?
Mum, Dad, go back to your room.

205
00:12:42,658 --> 00:12:43,778
I'll take care of this.

206
00:12:48,178 --> 00:12:49,298
Tian Zhen, what happened?

207
00:12:57,497 --> 00:12:58,414
Seriously.

208
00:12:58,497 --> 00:12:59,775
Mum, Dad,

209
00:12:59,858 --> 00:13:00,858
go back to your room.

210
00:13:01,738 --> 00:13:02,817
Everything's fine.

211
00:13:03,937 --> 00:13:05,024
I will take care of this.

212
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,521
Mum, wake Tou Tou up.

213
00:13:10,604 --> 00:13:12,170
Ask her to sleep in the living room.

214
00:13:12,497 --> 00:13:13,497
I'll watch Meng Meng.

215
00:13:14,338 --> 00:13:15,338
Okay.

216
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,560
Go back to bed.

217
00:13:24,617 --> 00:13:25,617
Meng Meng.

218
00:13:26,104 --> 00:13:27,104
Meng Meng.

219
00:13:27,764 --> 00:13:28,764
It's okay now.

220
00:13:28,956 --> 00:13:30,237
I turned off the phone.

221
00:13:33,978 --> 00:13:34,841
Meng Meng,

222
00:13:34,924 --> 00:13:37,218
it's okay now.
There is no one else here. Just me.

223
00:13:39,178 --> 00:13:40,178
Come out.

224
00:13:51,298 --> 00:13:52,697
Don't be afraid. It's okay now.

225
00:14:16,858 --> 00:14:18,057
Have you woken Tou Tou up?

226
00:14:20,098 --> 00:14:22,098
She won't wake up.

227
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,080
She keeps saying she has insomnia.

228
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,479
She set such a disturbing ringtone.

229
00:14:28,569 --> 00:14:30,526
I wouldn't be able to sleep too
if I heard it.

230
00:14:31,298 --> 00:14:33,338
But it didn't bother her at all.

231
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,755
She is full of nonsense

232
00:14:36,838 --> 00:14:38,784
and not afraid of
causing trouble for others.

233
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,321
Don't be mad.

234
00:14:41,218 --> 00:14:42,617
Don't be mad.

235
00:14:42,738 --> 00:14:44,898
We have two patients in our home,

236
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:46,978
and one of them is pretty good.

237
00:14:47,098 --> 00:14:48,098
This is not bad.

238
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,360
My parents,

239
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:53,670
you,

240
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,575
have always attracted patients
to our home throughout your lives.

241
00:14:56,658 --> 00:14:58,577
But I must say, I've never encountered

242
00:14:59,338 --> 00:15:01,057
patients like these two before.

243
00:15:02,098 --> 00:15:04,895
Meng Meng was brought back by your son,

244
00:15:04,978 --> 00:15:06,098
not me.

245
00:15:10,717 --> 00:15:11,717
Why do you think

246
00:15:12,098 --> 00:15:14,494
Tian Zhen is being so nice to Meng Meng?

247
00:15:14,577 --> 00:15:17,898
Doesn't this go beyond what a doctor
should do for their patients?

248
00:15:19,098 --> 00:15:20,135
Like my master said,

249
00:15:20,218 --> 00:15:23,418
Meng Meng is beautiful and wealthy.

250
00:15:23,778 --> 00:15:24,778
He has fallen for her?

251
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,840
That can't do.

252
00:15:27,017 --> 00:15:28,017
I have to

253
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:30,536
nip it in the bud.

254
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:32,534
Meng Meng is currently

255
00:15:32,617 --> 00:15:33,775
so mentally unstable.

256
00:15:33,858 --> 00:15:35,858
We can't let them
spend too much time together.

257
00:15:36,577 --> 00:15:38,258
You are also a TCM professor.

258
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,400
You don't discriminate
when you treat patients,

259
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,397
but you do when you
pick your daughter-in-law.

260
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,920
The power of choice
in your life lies with me.

261
00:15:46,257 --> 00:15:48,457
Don't meddle too much in this matter.

262
00:15:49,658 --> 00:15:51,457
How am I meddling too much?

263
00:15:52,898 --> 00:15:54,697
I'm not choosing my daughter-in-law.

264
00:15:55,404 --> 00:15:56,443
I'm choosing

265
00:15:56,778 --> 00:15:57,937
my grandchild's mother.

266
00:15:59,137 --> 00:16:01,017
Give the order.

267
00:16:01,658 --> 00:16:03,180
Ask Meng Meng to move out tomorrow.

268
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:05,255
We didn't think this through.

269
00:16:05,338 --> 00:16:07,775
It's not improper for
an unmarried man and woman

270
00:16:07,858 --> 00:16:09,135
to stay together alone in the same room.

271
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,614
They are not alone.

272
00:16:10,697 --> 00:16:12,137
Tou Tou is there too.

273
00:16:12,457 --> 00:16:13,538
She doesn't count.

274
00:16:15,218 --> 00:16:17,457
Tian Zhen has never taken her seriously.

275
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:20,015
She's just like the Monkey King,
when he hadn't been enlightened yet.

276
00:16:20,098 --> 00:16:21,098
Just

277
00:16:21,338 --> 00:16:22,457
mind your own business.

278
00:16:23,457 --> 00:16:24,494
Or you'd have insomnia

279
00:16:24,577 --> 00:16:25,655
like Tou Tou.

280
00:16:25,738 --> 00:16:26,815
My son's affairs

281
00:16:26,898 --> 00:16:27,898
are my affairs.

282
00:16:28,457 --> 00:16:29,588
I have to take care of it.

283
00:16:30,524 --> 00:16:31,524
Did you hear me?

284
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:33,997
Ask Meng Meng to leave tomorrow morning.

285
00:16:35,538 --> 00:16:36,538
Mr Ren?

286
00:16:44,457 --> 00:16:45,457
I can't sleep now.

287
00:17:20,658 --> 00:17:22,257
Wake up in the morning,

288
00:17:22,418 --> 00:17:23,977
embrace the sun.

289
00:17:24,097 --> 00:17:25,458
Let your body be filled with

290
00:17:25,737 --> 00:17:26,575
radiant sunlight.

291
00:17:26,658 --> 00:17:28,458
Change your ringtone now.

292
00:17:32,898 --> 00:17:34,977
Why are you acting up
early in the morning?

293
00:17:36,337 --> 00:17:39,207
Did you know that your ringtone
gave Meng Meng a fright last night?

294
00:17:42,137 --> 00:17:43,137
I mean,

295
00:17:43,418 --> 00:17:44,575
I'm using

296
00:17:44,658 --> 00:17:45,857
the trending ringtone,

297
00:17:46,257 --> 00:17:47,737
you know, The Standing Groundhog.

298
00:17:48,578 --> 00:17:49,578
Stop it.

299
00:17:50,617 --> 00:17:51,658
That's how it screamed.

300
00:17:52,337 --> 00:17:53,414
What's so scary about it?

301
00:17:53,497 --> 00:17:56,617
Do you know how the screaming
groundhog is eaten by the predators?

302
00:17:57,898 --> 00:17:58,898
I don't want to know.

303
00:17:59,097 --> 00:18:00,097
Change it now.

304
00:18:00,377 --> 00:18:01,477
I got it.

305
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,774
When Meng Meng wakes up later,

306
00:18:02,857 --> 00:18:05,338
I'll let her choose a ringtone
she likes, okay?

307
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,480
Like that one...

308
00:18:14,737 --> 00:18:16,257
What are you singing?

309
00:18:16,617 --> 00:18:17,617
Where is Meng Meng?

310
00:18:17,977 --> 00:18:18,934
She's still sleeping.

311
00:18:19,017 --> 00:18:20,975
Dad, Meng Meng slept late last night.

312
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,294
Let her sleep a little longer.

313
00:18:22,377 --> 00:18:23,277
Wake her up.

314
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,174
A regular daily routine is necessary
for the body to function properly.

315
00:18:26,257 --> 00:18:27,257
Go and wake her up.

316
00:18:29,257 --> 00:18:30,037
Hang on,

317
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,134
she was frightened last night.
Why didn't I hear...

318
00:18:32,217 --> 00:18:33,217
Master.

319
00:18:34,658 --> 00:18:35,658
Let's have breakfast.

320
00:18:38,017 --> 00:18:39,137
It's barbecued pork bun!

321
00:18:39,377 --> 00:18:41,030
We're having barbecued pork bun today.

322
00:18:44,257 --> 00:18:45,778
-What's wrong?
-Sit down and wait.

323
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:47,709
What I am waiting for?

324
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,147
Wait until everyone's here.

325
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:50,230
Wait for your elders.

326
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,240
Senior Brother!

327
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,534
Senior Brother, please.

328
00:18:56,617 --> 00:18:58,134
Master, take your seat now.

329
00:18:58,217 --> 00:18:59,778
-Grandma.
-What are you doing?

330
00:19:00,444 --> 00:19:01,444
Come.

331
00:19:02,497 --> 00:19:03,497
The elders are here.

332
00:19:03,584 --> 00:19:04,584
Can I dig in now?

333
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,800
What now?

334
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:12,435
What is the meaning of this?

335
00:19:16,898 --> 00:19:18,977
What... What organization is this?

336
00:19:19,578 --> 00:19:20,617
The morning pulse

337
00:19:21,257 --> 00:19:24,257
accurately reflects our body's condition.

338
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,520
This is the daily mandatory lesson
in our family.

339
00:19:26,617 --> 00:19:27,654
Put your arms out.

340
00:19:27,737 --> 00:19:29,815
Can't we have breakfast first?

341
00:19:29,898 --> 00:19:31,134
Let's read the pulse
after breakfast, okay?

342
00:19:31,217 --> 00:19:32,134
I'm starving.

343
00:19:32,217 --> 00:19:33,348
It won't be accurate then.

344
00:19:34,377 --> 00:19:35,497
Tou Tou, I'll teach you.

345
00:19:35,698 --> 00:19:36,698
Front.

346
00:19:37,698 --> 00:19:38,698
Middle.

347
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:40,458
Rear.

348
00:19:40,977 --> 00:19:41,977
Feel it.

349
00:19:46,617 --> 00:19:47,617
Front.

350
00:19:47,938 --> 00:19:48,938
Middle.

351
00:19:49,137 --> 00:19:50,137
Rear.

352
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:56,654
Feel any changes?

353
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:57,737
It's beating.

354
00:19:58,658 --> 00:19:59,745
Your reading is accurate.

355
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:01,617
I remember,

356
00:20:01,898 --> 00:20:04,414
the first time Tian Zhen
read someone's pulse when he was little,

357
00:20:04,497 --> 00:20:06,698
he said the same thing,
"It's beating."

358
00:20:08,097 --> 00:20:09,458
Tou Tou is right.

359
00:20:09,778 --> 00:20:11,298
If the pulse doesn't beat,

360
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,037
it means the person is dead.

361
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,180
Other than it's beating,

362
00:20:14,377 --> 00:20:15,508
do you feel anything else?

363
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:17,134
Nothing.

364
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:18,617
What else can I feel?

365
00:20:19,257 --> 00:20:20,257
I feel hungry.

366
00:20:20,658 --> 00:20:22,157
I just want to eat barbecued pork bun.

367
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,959
You are just starting to learn now.

368
00:20:24,497 --> 00:20:25,934
As time goes on,

369
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:29,337
you will be able to feel the
differences in the beating of the pulse.

370
00:20:29,898 --> 00:20:30,898
When?

371
00:20:31,818 --> 00:20:33,538
When will I feel the difference?

372
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,200
How do I know it's different?

373
00:20:35,418 --> 00:20:37,737
Everyone's pulse is unique.

374
00:20:37,977 --> 00:20:40,353
Some people may have a pulse that
is like a rapid and forceful current,

375
00:20:40,436 --> 00:20:42,868
some may have a pulse
that is like turbulent waves.

376
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:44,160
Some may have a pulse

377
00:20:44,277 --> 00:20:46,637
that is like plucking the strings
of a musical instrument,

378
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,416
and some whose pulse is quick
and sharp like flicking a marble.

379
00:20:51,436 --> 00:20:52,237
Remember,

380
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,880
as you continue
to practice pulse reading,

381
00:20:53,963 --> 00:20:55,815
you will gradually
gain clarity and insight.

382
00:20:55,898 --> 00:20:56,938
This is mysticism.

383
00:20:57,117 --> 00:20:58,237
Not at all.

384
00:20:59,178 --> 00:21:00,368
After reading pulses for a long time,

385
00:21:00,451 --> 00:21:03,410
when you place your fingers
on your patients' pulse,

386
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,561
you can gain insights
into their character

387
00:21:05,857 --> 00:21:07,553
and what they have been doing recently.

388
00:21:08,137 --> 00:21:10,938
Ling Ian, I can tell
what you've been up to recently.

389
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,040
You've just made

390
00:21:14,017 --> 00:21:15,097
barbecued pork buns.

391
00:21:17,283 --> 00:21:18,564
Nephew, read my pulse.

392
00:21:18,898 --> 00:21:21,257
Tell my about my character
and my recent experience.

393
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,477
There is one thing I know for sure.

394
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,560
Last night,

395
00:21:24,818 --> 00:21:26,538
you must have had the best sleep.

396
00:21:26,818 --> 00:21:27,815
That's true.

397
00:21:27,898 --> 00:21:31,217
I slept really well last night.
I feel very energetic today.

398
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,600
-Come.
-Meng Meng, you got scared last night.

399
00:21:35,017 --> 00:21:36,017
Are you okay?

400
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,680
Everyone's here.

401
00:21:39,818 --> 00:21:41,177
Let's dig in. Come on.

402
00:21:41,377 --> 00:21:42,377
Senior Brother,

403
00:21:43,298 --> 00:21:44,077
please.

404
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:47,520
In humble fare and meagre grain,
ponder the toil to sustain.

405
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:52,601
Half a thread, half a strand,
cherish them in mind.

406
00:21:54,377 --> 00:21:56,658
This family has so many rules
before eating.

407
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,186
(Longevity for oneself,
longevity for the world)

408
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,815
Luo Yong Xin, the specialist

409
00:22:25,898 --> 00:22:28,141
of Hepatobiliary Department
from Wuhan People's Hospital,

410
00:22:28,224 --> 00:22:29,504
sent you here?

411
00:22:29,617 --> 00:22:30,736
(Jiang Li)
That's right.

412
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,437
You have a medical insurance, right?

413
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,401
Yes.

414
00:22:34,484 --> 00:22:36,675
-Are your children staying with you?
-No.

415
00:22:36,758 --> 00:22:37,758
They are abroad.

416
00:22:38,898 --> 00:22:40,257
What about relatives?

417
00:22:41,178 --> 00:22:42,178
No.

418
00:22:42,517 --> 00:22:43,517
It's just me alone.

419
00:22:44,184 --> 00:22:45,503
You're living alone?

420
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:47,642
Are you staying with a caretaker?

421
00:22:49,283 --> 00:22:50,283
Professor Ren,

422
00:22:50,424 --> 00:22:51,903
just be honest with me.

423
00:22:52,357 --> 00:22:53,676
Someone already told me

424
00:22:53,917 --> 00:22:54,877
that

425
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,960
if a TCM practitioner

426
00:22:56,178 --> 00:22:58,174
recommends you to see a Western doctor,

427
00:22:58,257 --> 00:23:00,538
it means your condition is severe.

428
00:23:00,778 --> 00:23:03,294
And if a Western doctor recommends
you to see a TCM practitioner,

429
00:23:03,377 --> 00:23:05,017
it means you are beyond help.

430
00:23:05,778 --> 00:23:07,578
I've braced myself for it.

431
00:23:13,377 --> 00:23:15,898
Looks like Luo Yong Xin
can't cure your illness.

432
00:23:19,357 --> 00:23:20,357
I knew it.

433
00:23:21,058 --> 00:23:22,257
I figured it out.

434
00:23:23,738 --> 00:23:25,017
How much time do I have left?

435
00:23:26,083 --> 00:23:27,083
Tell me.

436
00:23:32,415 --> 00:23:33,813
He can't cure you,

437
00:23:33,896 --> 00:23:35,817
but it doesn't mean I can't cure you too.

438
00:23:36,377 --> 00:23:37,377
You can cure me?

439
00:23:39,377 --> 00:23:41,014
Dr Luo is the top expert

440
00:23:41,097 --> 00:23:42,254
in the country

441
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:44,294
when it comes to treating this condition.

442
00:23:44,377 --> 00:23:45,277
Yes.

443
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,054
That's in the domain of Western medicine.

444
00:23:47,137 --> 00:23:48,977
You haven't tried TCM's treatment yet.

445
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:51,227
What's the treatment then?

446
00:23:51,857 --> 00:23:52,761
Drinking medicine?

447
00:23:52,844 --> 00:23:53,844
Acupuncture?

448
00:23:54,256 --> 00:23:55,774
Drinking medicine and getting acupuncture

449
00:23:55,857 --> 00:23:59,017
are common treatment methods,

450
00:23:59,137 --> 00:24:01,257
but they can't cure your illness for now.

451
00:24:03,003 --> 00:24:04,243
Let me ask you,

452
00:24:04,778 --> 00:24:06,377
did you ever kill animals

453
00:24:06,977 --> 00:24:08,257
when you were young?

454
00:24:09,316 --> 00:24:11,217
No. I'm very caring and kind.

455
00:24:11,778 --> 00:24:14,857
Chickens and geese also count.

456
00:24:15,898 --> 00:24:16,815
Do

457
00:24:16,898 --> 00:24:18,295
snails and crayfish also count?

458
00:24:18,378 --> 00:24:20,018
That's even worse.

459
00:24:20,337 --> 00:24:21,737
Think about it.

460
00:24:22,017 --> 00:24:24,294
We usually eat half of a chicken

461
00:24:24,377 --> 00:24:27,294
or half a goose in a meal.

462
00:24:27,377 --> 00:24:28,818
As for crayfish

463
00:24:29,377 --> 00:24:30,414
and snails,

464
00:24:30,497 --> 00:24:31,735
we probably eat

465
00:24:31,818 --> 00:24:33,497
dozens or hundreds of them in a meal.

466
00:24:35,658 --> 00:24:36,778
In that case,

467
00:24:37,377 --> 00:24:38,934
I've really killed a lot then.

468
00:24:39,017 --> 00:24:40,204
There was a period of time

469
00:24:40,578 --> 00:24:42,297
when my spouse was in poor health.

470
00:24:42,503 --> 00:24:43,978
To treat his illness,

471
00:24:44,071 --> 00:24:45,870
I had to slaughter two pigeons every day.

472
00:24:46,337 --> 00:24:47,534
As for snails and crayfish,

473
00:24:47,617 --> 00:24:48,654
I ate a lot of them

474
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:49,977
in a year.

475
00:24:50,337 --> 00:24:51,737
You see, you see,

476
00:24:51,898 --> 00:24:53,017
these actions

477
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:55,661
are considered
as accumulating karmic obstacles.

478
00:24:57,857 --> 00:24:59,857
All lives are equal.

479
00:25:00,898 --> 00:25:03,617
All these grudges of life

480
00:25:03,857 --> 00:25:06,174
seem to have concentrated on you alone.

481
00:25:06,257 --> 00:25:07,538
That's why I asked

482
00:25:08,377 --> 00:25:10,695
if you are staying with your relatives.

483
00:25:10,778 --> 00:25:12,054
If you are,

484
00:25:12,137 --> 00:25:14,737
ask one of them to travel with you.

485
00:25:15,217 --> 00:25:16,977
There are so many mountains

486
00:25:17,257 --> 00:25:19,254
and rivers in our country,

487
00:25:19,337 --> 00:25:20,857
why don't you go visit them?

488
00:25:21,377 --> 00:25:23,737
You can also go to temples
and offer incense.

489
00:25:24,137 --> 00:25:25,268
That's all you need to do.

490
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,560
That's it?

491
00:25:31,137 --> 00:25:31,934
No.

492
00:25:32,017 --> 00:25:33,617
I checked your blood pressure,

493
00:25:33,737 --> 00:25:35,137
and it's not very stable.

494
00:25:35,458 --> 00:25:36,763
I will prescribe some medicine

495
00:25:37,217 --> 00:25:38,737
to help stabilize your mood

496
00:25:39,857 --> 00:25:41,938
and improve your sleep.

497
00:25:45,276 --> 00:25:47,414
Just show them this prescription.

498
00:25:47,497 --> 00:25:49,137
They will collect the herbs for you.

499
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,520
Come.

500
00:25:51,737 --> 00:25:52,737
Come.

501
00:25:52,891 --> 00:25:54,290
Just go to him.

502
00:25:55,818 --> 00:25:57,338
Master! Master!

503
00:25:57,497 --> 00:25:58,495
Master.

504
00:25:58,578 --> 00:25:59,578
Master, I...

505
00:25:59,857 --> 00:26:00,883
I'd like to take leave.

506
00:26:01,377 --> 00:26:02,294
Why?

507
00:26:02,377 --> 00:26:03,375
You mentioned

508
00:26:03,458 --> 00:26:05,534
about the mountains and rivers.

509
00:26:05,617 --> 00:26:07,617
I'd like to visit a temple
and pay respect too.

510
00:26:09,511 --> 00:26:11,857
I ate more crayfish
than Grandma Jiang did.

511
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:13,737
Really.

512
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:15,503
-About the karmic obstacles...
-Mr Ren.

513
00:26:15,977 --> 00:26:17,294
Xu Meng's medicinal herbs
have been collected.

514
00:26:17,377 --> 00:26:19,497
Would you like to decoct it here
or at home?

515
00:26:20,137 --> 00:26:22,254
There is Aconite in it.
The fire must be kept on all time.

516
00:26:22,337 --> 00:26:23,337
Got it.

517
00:26:23,497 --> 00:26:25,337
Master, I will decoct
Meng Meng's medicine.

518
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,337
-I will decoct it this evening.
-How diligent.

519
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,560
But you need to give me my phone.

520
00:26:33,658 --> 00:26:34,904
I need to look at the time.

521
00:26:35,097 --> 00:26:36,097
I don't want

522
00:26:36,309 --> 00:26:37,309
to overboil it.

523
00:26:39,658 --> 00:26:42,617
Fine. I will give you back your phone
when you decoct it.

524
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:46,516
About my leave...

525
00:26:47,977 --> 00:26:49,898
You're ignoring my trouble.

526
00:26:50,857 --> 00:26:52,377
I'm a successor.

527
00:26:52,898 --> 00:26:54,538
I have a lot of karmic obstacles.

528
00:26:59,737 --> 00:27:00,737
Hello, Mum.

529
00:27:01,063 --> 00:27:02,584
(Quan, how have you been?)

530
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:04,897
(Have you been eating well?)

531
00:27:05,047 --> 00:27:06,368
(Are you dressed warmly?)

532
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:08,009
How's your work?

533
00:27:08,337 --> 00:27:09,857
Did your teacher compliment you?

534
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,169
Don't worry about me, Mum.
I'm doing great.

535
00:27:14,097 --> 00:27:16,997
By the way, Mum, I recently checked
the weather forecast for my hometown.

536
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,054
It seems that there have been
several days of heavy rain.

537
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,778
How are Dad's legs?

538
00:27:21,617 --> 00:27:22,534
He's fine.

539
00:27:22,617 --> 00:27:23,720
It didn't affect our work.

540
00:27:23,803 --> 00:27:24,803
Don't worry.

541
00:27:26,517 --> 00:27:27,517
Quan,

542
00:27:27,657 --> 00:27:30,257
Dragon Boat Festival is coming soon.

543
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:32,054
Your dad and I

544
00:27:32,137 --> 00:27:34,698
have been entrusted by the entire village

545
00:27:35,056 --> 00:27:36,934
(to bring you some delicious food.)

546
00:27:37,017 --> 00:27:38,538
Mum, you don't have to come.

547
00:27:39,137 --> 00:27:41,485
There is no need for the trouble.
I'm doing great here.

548
00:27:42,017 --> 00:27:43,174
(Don't worry.)

549
00:27:43,257 --> 00:27:44,254
The secretary

550
00:27:44,337 --> 00:27:46,217
even bought us train tickets.

551
00:27:46,497 --> 00:27:48,778
We've got to visit the city.

552
00:27:51,097 --> 00:27:52,654
You really don't have to come, Mum.

553
00:27:52,737 --> 00:27:54,375
I can take good care of myself here.

554
00:27:54,458 --> 00:27:55,458
Do you hear me?

555
00:27:57,283 --> 00:27:58,283
Hello?

556
00:28:12,217 --> 00:28:13,174
You're finally here.

557
00:28:13,257 --> 00:28:14,337
Look at the time now.

558
00:28:14,898 --> 00:28:16,942
You've missed two
follow-up appointments before.

559
00:28:17,497 --> 00:28:18,857
My master is going to nag you.

560
00:28:19,617 --> 00:28:20,617
Hang on,

561
00:28:20,729 --> 00:28:22,450
what's going on with you this time?

562
00:28:23,737 --> 00:28:25,254
She looks really pale.

563
00:28:25,337 --> 00:28:26,294
Let me see.

564
00:28:26,377 --> 00:28:27,774
You didn't get much rest, did you?

565
00:28:27,857 --> 00:28:28,857
I've had too much

566
00:28:29,578 --> 00:28:30,737
going on lately.

567
00:28:32,017 --> 00:28:33,414
(Cheng Ying)
Everything is a mess.

568
00:28:33,497 --> 00:28:35,802
I don't have any mood
to come for follow-up treatment.

569
00:28:37,056 --> 00:28:38,056
Madam,

570
00:28:38,778 --> 00:28:40,495
you are responsible for your own health.

571
00:28:40,578 --> 00:28:41,335
If you don't take it seriously,

572
00:28:41,418 --> 00:28:43,245
no one else will
take it seriously for you.

573
00:28:46,617 --> 00:28:48,054
You still have
excessive menstrual bleeding.

574
00:28:48,137 --> 00:28:49,398
Have you taken your medicine?

575
00:28:50,597 --> 00:28:51,877
My health...

576
00:28:54,458 --> 00:28:56,377
No one cares about me now.

577
00:28:57,377 --> 00:28:58,458
What's wrong?

578
00:28:59,017 --> 00:29:00,017
I...

579
00:29:00,377 --> 00:29:02,617
My life is completely out of control now.

580
00:29:03,097 --> 00:29:04,497
My husband is having an affair

581
00:29:05,578 --> 00:29:07,377
and insisting on getting a divorce.

582
00:29:15,377 --> 00:29:17,298
Is anyone there? Please give us a hand.

583
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,465
Madam Zhu, are you here
for her follow-up appointment?

584
00:29:22,377 --> 00:29:24,217
She said her legs feel cold.

585
00:29:24,497 --> 00:29:25,537
I was so overjoyed

586
00:29:25,716 --> 00:29:27,134
that I almost shed tears.

587
00:29:27,217 --> 00:29:29,261
So, I came to ask
Professor Ren to check on her.

588
00:29:29,617 --> 00:29:30,495
We will go in first.

589
00:29:30,578 --> 00:29:31,578
Okay.

590
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:37,053
(Qibo Medical Centre)

591
00:29:37,377 --> 00:29:39,737
There is a crazy woman who is suing me.

592
00:29:41,857 --> 00:29:43,855
She is giving me trouble at my workplace

593
00:29:43,938 --> 00:29:45,737
and in court.

594
00:29:46,497 --> 00:29:48,698
She is driving me crazy.

595
00:29:49,617 --> 00:29:52,497
My son is still so little.
No one can take care of him.

596
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,800
Cheng Ying!

597
00:29:58,337 --> 00:29:59,337
Who are you?

598
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:06,578
Meng Meng, are you okay?

599
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,800
No fighting.

600
00:30:12,497 --> 00:30:13,497
Mum!

601
00:30:16,137 --> 00:30:17,137
Mum!

602
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:30,650
Stop fighting!

603
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,960
They are enemies
who run into each other here.

604
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,079
Xia, calm down.

605
00:30:36,517 --> 00:30:37,517
Doctor...

606
00:31:05,377 --> 00:31:06,377
Quiet, quiet.

607
00:31:08,898 --> 00:31:11,017
It was an accident.

608
00:31:13,658 --> 00:31:15,737
I really didn't mean to do it.

609
00:31:16,137 --> 00:31:20,200
I... I really wish it was me
who got hit.

610
00:31:21,257 --> 00:31:23,103
That's enough.
Do you really want to die?

611
00:31:24,604 --> 00:31:25,604
Quiet, quiet.

612
00:31:30,737 --> 00:31:31,737
Professor Ren,

613
00:31:32,411 --> 00:31:34,930
do you remember when I told you last time

614
00:31:35,857 --> 00:31:38,200
that I suspected my husband
was having an affair?

615
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,080
(Two months ago)

616
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,200
Professor Ren,

617
00:31:44,737 --> 00:31:46,178
is my condition treatable?

618
00:31:46,578 --> 00:31:47,857
30 days in a month,

619
00:31:48,217 --> 00:31:49,826
and I have been bleeding for 28 days.

620
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,183
It's really starting
to take a toll on me.

621
00:31:53,737 --> 00:31:54,977
Is it untreatable?

622
00:31:58,578 --> 00:31:59,977
Actually, your condition

623
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,080
isn't serious.

624
00:32:02,137 --> 00:32:03,877
It's just that the treatment takes time.

625
00:32:04,778 --> 00:32:06,178
This isn't serious?

626
00:32:07,857 --> 00:32:10,054
I started suffering from this
shortly after giving birth to my child.

627
00:32:10,137 --> 00:32:11,497
My son is four years old.

628
00:32:11,977 --> 00:32:13,797
I've been seeking treatment for
my illness for two and a half years.

629
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,014
I have seen many doctors
and taken numerous medications,

630
00:32:16,097 --> 00:32:18,097
but so far, there hasn't been
much improvement.

631
00:32:18,337 --> 00:32:19,575
I have told you before

632
00:32:19,658 --> 00:32:21,014
that in order to cure your illness,

633
00:32:21,097 --> 00:32:23,174
your husband must undergo
the treatment with you.

634
00:32:23,257 --> 00:32:25,171
Tell your husband
to come with you next time.

635
00:32:26,578 --> 00:32:27,977
He won't listen to me.

636
00:32:28,737 --> 00:32:29,737
Professor Ren,

637
00:32:31,497 --> 00:32:33,377
I suspect that he is cheating on me now.

638
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,179
What do you want to do then?

639
00:32:46,977 --> 00:32:47,977
Take some medicine.

640
00:32:49,737 --> 00:32:51,418
I think if you want to get better,

641
00:32:51,617 --> 00:32:53,977
you mustn't be paranoid.

642
00:32:55,458 --> 00:32:57,632
How about this?
Go and collect your medicine first.

643
00:33:08,977 --> 00:33:10,238
Here's your birthday present.

644
00:33:12,783 --> 00:33:14,001
Aren't you going to open it?

645
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,097
My hands are tied. Le Le!

646
00:33:18,977 --> 00:33:19,977
Breakfast is ready!

647
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,080
What do you think? Do you like it?

648
00:33:53,778 --> 00:33:55,538
I didn't know Ferrari made wallets.

649
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,513
These are derived products
of high-end brands.

650
00:33:57,596 --> 00:33:59,076
Hermes even sells lipsticks.

651
00:34:00,257 --> 00:34:01,337
Le Le, hurry up.

652
00:34:01,617 --> 00:34:03,017
Le Le, hurry up.

653
00:34:03,497 --> 00:34:04,497
Hurry.

654
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:08,178
We're having dinner
at my parents' place tonight.

655
00:34:08,498 --> 00:34:09,577
Get off work early.

656
00:34:09,978 --> 00:34:11,037
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

657
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,494
I have an appointment
with a client tonight.

658
00:34:12,577 --> 00:34:14,294
Start the dinner without me.
I'll come later.

659
00:34:14,377 --> 00:34:15,294
Let's go. Hurry up.

660
00:34:15,377 --> 00:34:16,377
Come on.

661
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:25,930
Hello, honey.

662
00:34:26,377 --> 00:34:28,058
I received your wine. Thank you.

663
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,415
Why are you being so polite with me?

664
00:34:30,498 --> 00:34:31,498
I'm telling you,

665
00:34:31,617 --> 00:34:33,018
it wasn't easy to buy this wine.

666
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:34,738
I know.

667
00:34:34,898 --> 00:34:36,857
My husband has been trying to find it.

668
00:34:37,498 --> 00:34:39,218
What's going on? You guys made up?

669
00:34:39,857 --> 00:34:41,214
Not exactly.

670
00:34:41,297 --> 00:34:43,397
That's just life.
There are good days and bad days.

671
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,597
All married couples are like this.

672
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,420
Why did you buy him such expensive wine?

673
00:34:46,857 --> 00:34:48,944
It's your birthday,
but you're giving him a gift.

674
00:34:49,576 --> 00:34:51,016
He gave me a wallet too.

675
00:34:51,137 --> 00:34:52,218
From Ferrari.

676
00:34:53,738 --> 00:34:54,738
(What the hell?)

677
00:34:55,658 --> 00:34:57,534
It's a specially customized edition.

678
00:34:57,617 --> 00:34:59,270
You don't know they have this, do you?

679
00:34:59,698 --> 00:35:00,785
Fine, fine. I don't know.

680
00:35:01,738 --> 00:35:02,857
Remember,

681
00:35:03,178 --> 00:35:05,700
keep showing off your love
might lead to a break-up sooner.

682
00:35:09,938 --> 00:35:10,815
What do you think?

683
00:35:10,898 --> 00:35:11,935
Do you like your car?

684
00:35:12,018 --> 00:35:12,895
Yes.

685
00:35:12,978 --> 00:35:14,014
Thanks, honey.

686
00:35:14,097 --> 00:35:15,097
I'm glad you liked it.

687
00:35:15,418 --> 00:35:17,418
How about taking me for a ride later?

688
00:35:17,617 --> 00:35:18,617
Sure.

689
00:35:48,577 --> 00:35:50,855
I didn't mean to hit her.

690
00:35:50,938 --> 00:35:52,857
I already told her that.

691
00:35:54,178 --> 00:35:55,857
It wasn't my intention.

692
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,920
Professor Ren.

693
00:36:05,418 --> 00:36:06,857
What brings you to my school?

694
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,095
-I...
-What's wrong?

695
00:36:08,178 --> 00:36:09,857
I think I'm losing it.

696
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,560
Professor Ren,

697
00:36:11,978 --> 00:36:13,498
you have to help me.

698
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,040
Where is your husband?

699
00:36:17,018 --> 00:36:18,777
He is cheating on me.

700
00:36:19,522 --> 00:36:21,281
I saw it with my own eyes.

701
00:36:21,364 --> 00:36:23,604
I saw it with my own eyes.

702
00:36:25,604 --> 00:36:27,417
Calm down, okay?

703
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,680
Professor Ren,

704
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,400
I'm losing all my blood.

705
00:36:35,698 --> 00:36:36,898
Am I dying soon?

706
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,961
Don't say that.

707
00:36:39,857 --> 00:36:41,458
It's not that easy to die.

708
00:36:42,498 --> 00:36:44,585
Have you taken the medicine
I prescribed for you?

709
00:36:45,218 --> 00:36:46,218
No.

710
00:36:46,557 --> 00:36:49,694
I... I forgot to take it this week.

711
00:36:49,777 --> 00:36:52,297
You have no idea
how terrible my life has been.

712
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:58,176
She is a murderer!

713
00:36:58,396 --> 00:37:00,596
She has ruined my daughter's life!

714
00:37:00,837 --> 00:37:02,405
She must be sentenced to death!

715
00:37:03,284 --> 00:37:05,124
I didn't do it on purpose.

716
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,481
And what did you do to me?

717
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:08,244
You're stalking me

718
00:37:08,405 --> 00:37:09,522
like a lunatic.

719
00:37:09,605 --> 00:37:11,481
She follows me to my workplace,

720
00:37:11,564 --> 00:37:12,642
to my home.

721
00:37:12,725 --> 00:37:15,018
She even posts defamatory messages
about me online.

722
00:37:15,405 --> 00:37:18,405
You're driving me crazy, you know?

723
00:37:18,828 --> 00:37:19,882
-You're going crazy?
-Officers!

724
00:37:19,965 --> 00:37:22,183
-I'm the one who's going crazy!
-What are you doing?

725
00:37:31,005 --> 00:37:34,124
He bought a luxury car for his mistress.

726
00:37:34,764 --> 00:37:36,445
On my birthday,

727
00:37:36,645 --> 00:37:38,562
he gave me the gift
that came with the car

728
00:37:38,645 --> 00:37:40,764
as my birthday present.

729
00:37:41,477 --> 00:37:43,717
You need to control your emotions.

730
00:37:45,844 --> 00:37:47,925
If you lose control of your emotions,

731
00:37:48,188 --> 00:37:50,364
even if I give you acupuncture
or medication,

732
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,322
it can only treat your body,

733
00:37:52,405 --> 00:37:53,685
not your mind.

734
00:37:54,324 --> 00:37:55,445
You hate your husband.

735
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,474
Your hatred will harm your heart,
you know?

736
00:37:59,725 --> 00:38:01,445
The heart governs the blood vessels.

737
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,247
If your blood vessels are damaged,
how can your menstrual cycle improve?

738
00:38:05,845 --> 00:38:07,745
But now every time I close my eyes,

739
00:38:07,828 --> 00:38:09,747
I see my husband and his mistress.

740
00:38:09,965 --> 00:38:11,721
I think about my poor son

741
00:38:11,804 --> 00:38:14,022
who is going to lose his father
at such a young age.

742
00:38:14,165 --> 00:38:15,245
All right now.

743
00:38:15,844 --> 00:38:17,362
You need to calm down.

744
00:38:17,445 --> 00:38:18,844
Stay calm.

745
00:38:19,205 --> 00:38:20,284
Take a nap.

746
00:38:21,748 --> 00:38:22,748
God

747
00:38:23,084 --> 00:38:24,844
must have left you a way out,

748
00:38:25,725 --> 00:38:28,364
but you have to find it yourself.

749
00:38:29,205 --> 00:38:30,205
Do you understand?

750
00:38:31,351 --> 00:38:32,305
I have caused

751
00:38:32,388 --> 00:38:34,868
another trouble now.

752
00:38:35,165 --> 00:38:37,284
Where is my way out?

753
00:38:43,165 --> 00:38:44,165
Go to the front.

754
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:45,405
I will stay with her.

755
00:38:52,165 --> 00:38:53,685
All right now. Don't cry.

756
00:38:54,324 --> 00:38:56,445
You see, we've performed
acupuncture for you.

757
00:38:59,165 --> 00:39:00,481
Thank you.

758
00:39:00,564 --> 00:39:01,685
It's okay.

759
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:03,922
-It's okay.
-Thank you.

760
00:39:04,005 --> 00:39:05,005
It's okay.

761
00:39:05,364 --> 00:39:06,364
It's okay.

762
00:39:07,965 --> 00:39:08,965
It's okay now.

763
00:39:10,324 --> 00:39:11,324
Mum.

764
00:39:12,788 --> 00:39:14,397
It's okay, Meng Meng.
Don't be afraid.

765
00:39:15,764 --> 00:39:16,965
That scared me.

766
00:39:18,828 --> 00:39:19,745
Are you okay?

767
00:39:19,828 --> 00:39:20,802
I'm fine.

768
00:39:20,885 --> 00:39:21,885
Professor Ren,

769
00:39:22,165 --> 00:39:23,241
you shouldn't save her.

770
00:39:23,324 --> 00:39:24,844
You should have just let her die.

771
00:39:33,364 --> 00:39:34,364
She's dead.

772
00:39:35,352 --> 00:39:36,352
She just died.

773
00:39:37,604 --> 00:39:39,344
A car will come and take her away later.

774
00:39:42,645 --> 00:39:43,645
It's okay.

775
00:39:44,764 --> 00:39:46,597
Take her to the back and let her rest.

776
00:39:47,324 --> 00:39:48,324
Don't worry. It's okay.

777
00:40:03,084 --> 00:40:04,084
She's dead.

778
00:40:04,657 --> 00:40:05,918
What are you going to do now?

779
00:40:09,828 --> 00:40:11,067
I think

780
00:40:12,885 --> 00:40:14,685
you're going to get sued.

781
00:40:16,245 --> 00:40:17,802
Everyone saw it just now.

782
00:40:17,885 --> 00:40:19,844
You had a fight with her before she died.

783
00:40:20,618 --> 00:40:22,966
You had a fight with her
in the courtroom this morning.

784
00:40:24,124 --> 00:40:26,405
Her husband and her child
won't let you off the hook.

785
00:40:27,038 --> 00:40:28,473
You will have to compensate them.

786
00:40:29,604 --> 00:40:31,005
How much money do you have now?

787
00:40:34,165 --> 00:40:35,764
I'm asking you.

788
00:40:40,165 --> 00:40:41,082
Tian Zhen,

789
00:40:41,165 --> 00:40:42,677
go and give her family a call.

790
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,945
Ask him to bring their child
to see her off one last time.

791
00:40:45,028 --> 00:40:46,028
Okay.

792
00:40:46,645 --> 00:40:47,645
Professor Ren.

793
00:40:49,132 --> 00:40:50,932
Holding onto me won't help you.

794
00:40:55,245 --> 00:40:56,245
Master,

795
00:40:56,628 --> 00:40:58,976
I just saw a dead person
for the first time in my life.

796
00:41:01,468 --> 00:41:03,065
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

797
00:41:03,148 --> 00:41:04,552

traditional Chinese medicine books)
