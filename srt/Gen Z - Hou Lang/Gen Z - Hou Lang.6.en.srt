1
00:00:05,703 --> 00:00:07,921
Next, we will recite
the Virtue of A Great Physician

2
00:00:08,503 --> 00:00:10,182
in front of Dr. Huang's grave.

3
00:00:11,203 --> 00:00:12,322
To console our ancestors,

4
00:00:12,422 --> 00:00:13,503
carry on the legacy,

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,359
remain true to our original aspirations,
save lives and heal the injured.

6
00:00:16,442 --> 00:00:17,615
These are our aspirations.

7
00:00:18,662 --> 00:00:20,300
The Virtue of A Great Physician...

8
00:00:20,383 --> 00:00:21,543
Do you think he can

9
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,720
hear you reciting these?

10
00:00:23,822 --> 00:00:25,179
Do you really think

11
00:00:25,262 --> 00:00:27,262
he can hear you reciting these?

12
00:00:28,703 --> 00:00:29,703
He can't, can he?

13
00:00:31,063 --> 00:00:33,422
In this case, I think
Western medicine is better.

14
00:00:33,582 --> 00:00:36,117
At least Western medicine practitioners
don't have to do something like this.

15
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,463
Look at you bunch.

16
00:00:37,943 --> 00:00:39,659
Western medicine practitioners
have to take an oath too.

17
00:00:39,742 --> 00:00:40,943
The Hippocratic Oath.

18
00:00:41,823 --> 00:00:43,582
Fine. You are all the same.

19
00:00:44,102 --> 00:00:45,582
You said the oath for yourself.

20
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,340
Just like when people get married,

21
00:00:47,423 --> 00:00:49,983
they say "I will love you
for the rest of my life."

22
00:00:50,743 --> 00:00:52,140
"I will love you
for the rest of my life."

23
00:00:52,223 --> 00:00:54,022
In the end, it's just a lie.

24
00:00:55,863 --> 00:00:57,211
Have you never visited a grave?

25
00:00:57,502 --> 00:00:59,622
Have you not attended
any memorial service?

26
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,780
Won't it bother you
if someone is being so impolite

27
00:01:01,863 --> 00:01:03,323
in front of your family's grave?

28
00:01:10,943 --> 00:01:13,204
I have no family,
so I have never visited any graves.

29
00:01:13,663 --> 00:01:14,663
I'm an orphan.

30
00:01:15,456 --> 00:01:17,056
I grew up in an orphanage.

31
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:19,192
I've never seen a ceremony like this.

32
00:01:19,736 --> 00:01:21,497
The biggest ceremony I've ever attended

33
00:01:21,863 --> 00:01:23,623
was every time there was an open house,

34
00:01:23,943 --> 00:01:25,983
every child would sit at the front door

35
00:01:26,663 --> 00:01:27,663
with a red headband,

36
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,333
waiting for the adoptive parents

37
00:01:29,416 --> 00:01:30,416
to come and adopt us.

38
00:01:30,663 --> 00:01:31,663
As time passed,

39
00:01:31,943 --> 00:01:33,742
the obedient children were adopted.

40
00:01:34,382 --> 00:01:36,078
The disobedient ones were also adopted.

41
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,921
Even the sick ones were adopted,

42
00:01:39,943 --> 00:01:41,023
but no one wanted me.

43
00:01:42,863 --> 00:01:44,019
For me, my closest families

44
00:01:44,102 --> 00:01:45,583
are the women

45
00:01:45,989 --> 00:01:46,989
who took care of me

46
00:01:48,462 --> 00:01:49,583
in the orphanage.

47
00:01:50,382 --> 00:01:51,382
Tou Tou,

48
00:01:52,303 --> 00:01:53,303
I'm sorry.

49
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:56,502
Rebecca didn't know
about your background.

50
00:02:04,023 --> 00:02:05,241
I was just messing with you.

51
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,920
You...

52
00:02:12,303 --> 00:02:13,383
Is it fun to lie?

53
00:02:14,223 --> 00:02:15,943
What else can you do besides lying?

54
00:02:16,743 --> 00:02:18,782
You are like a dandelion.
You are rootless.

55
00:02:19,023 --> 00:02:21,303
But we all have our
own families and ancestors.

56
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,640
Even if you don't understand this,
don't agree with this,

57
00:02:23,723 --> 00:02:24,916
can't you just stay silent?

58
00:02:25,663 --> 00:02:28,577
Or do you think you can seek pity
or sympathy by behaving like this?

59
00:02:30,743 --> 00:02:31,823
I don't need pity

60
00:02:32,383 --> 00:02:33,702
nor sympathy.

61
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:35,782
I just think,

62
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:37,844
you know what this is called?

63
00:02:39,023 --> 00:02:40,589
Gathering for superstitious beliefs.

64
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:41,743
Got it?

65
00:02:42,108 --> 00:02:43,108
A bunch of people

66
00:02:43,943 --> 00:02:44,982
put a bunch of stuff

67
00:02:45,823 --> 00:02:47,700
in front of a deceased person.

68
00:02:47,783 --> 00:02:50,703
Do you know that many people
do not have enough to eat or drink?

69
00:02:51,103 --> 00:02:52,740
Do you know what this looks like to me?

70
00:02:52,823 --> 00:02:54,103
You are wasting food.

71
00:02:54,903 --> 00:02:57,102
I really don't understand
what you are thinking.

72
00:02:57,303 --> 00:02:58,183
You just stand here

73
00:02:58,383 --> 00:02:59,183
and recite poems.

74
00:02:59,455 --> 00:03:01,383
You really think he can hear you?

75
00:03:02,422 --> 00:03:04,814
You are reciting something
people don't even understand.

76
00:03:05,223 --> 00:03:06,540
The Virtue of A Great Physician.

77
00:03:06,623 --> 00:03:08,343
The Virtue of A Great Physician.

78
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,740
What's point of this?

79
00:03:10,823 --> 00:03:12,542
It's not like he's your own family

80
00:03:12,702 --> 00:03:15,224
He wasn't related to you.
And you're paying respect to him.

81
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:17,023
Seriously.

82
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:20,493
Present illnesses may have internal
similarities but external differences,

83
00:03:20,576 --> 00:03:23,059
and likewise, they may have internal
differences but external similarities.

84
00:03:23,142 --> 00:03:25,863
Therefore, the fullness
or deficiency of the organs

85
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,374
and the obstruction or smooth flow
of the blood vessels affect each other.

86
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,401
The slope is quite steep.

87
00:03:36,103 --> 00:03:37,461
You guys do this every year.

88
00:03:37,568 --> 00:03:38,873
You walk this path every year.

89
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,419
-Professor Ren.
-Everyone's here?

90
00:03:41,502 --> 00:03:43,589
You guys came much
earlier than last year, right?

91
00:03:44,142 --> 00:03:45,740
No. Every year,

92
00:03:45,823 --> 00:03:47,863
you all come earlier than me.

93
00:03:49,542 --> 00:03:51,140
Yes, yes. You must be tired.

94
00:03:51,223 --> 00:03:52,383
The food is ready.

95
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,459
We can have lunch soon.

96
00:03:54,542 --> 00:03:55,863
Okay. Thank you, thank you.

97
00:03:56,142 --> 00:03:57,142
Tian Zhen,

98
00:03:57,823 --> 00:03:59,156
these are your dad's patients?

99
00:04:00,262 --> 00:04:02,101
They are folks from nearby villages.

100
00:04:02,184 --> 00:04:04,101
They know we would come to the
mountain every year to visit the grave,

101
00:04:04,184 --> 00:04:06,179
so they would clean the room

102
00:04:06,262 --> 00:04:07,419
and cook for us in advance.

103
00:04:07,502 --> 00:04:10,285
My parents would also take
the opportunity to check their health.

104
00:04:10,823 --> 00:04:11,823
-It's good.
-Let's go.

105
00:04:21,142 --> 00:04:23,142
As I told you before,

106
00:04:23,343 --> 00:04:24,343
take this decoction

107
00:04:25,303 --> 00:04:27,343
three times a day.

108
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,018
Take it half an hour after meals.

109
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,134
The prescription last time was good.

110
00:04:31,217 --> 00:04:32,299
It worked very well.

111
00:04:32,382 --> 00:04:34,139
-Good.
-Thank you.

112
00:04:34,222 --> 00:04:35,022
It's nothing.

113
00:04:35,262 --> 00:04:36,702
We left a lot of food

114
00:04:36,982 --> 00:04:38,662
on the grave just now.

115
00:04:40,303 --> 00:04:42,662
Professor Ren, don't worry.
It won't be wasted.

116
00:04:43,215 --> 00:04:44,877
When life is difficult,

117
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,120
the folks are taking them
home as rations.

118
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,619
Although the offering is
for worshiping the ancestors,

119
00:04:50,702 --> 00:04:52,356
they are merely symbolic gestures.

120
00:04:52,446 --> 00:04:54,468
The offerings taste better than
the usual food.

121
00:04:54,623 --> 00:04:55,822
Why would we waste them?

122
00:04:56,069 --> 00:04:57,109
How's your life?

123
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,339
There is no need to ask.

124
00:04:59,422 --> 00:05:00,975
Everyday is like Chinese New Year.

125
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,821
Those wild animals in the mountains
will finish them.

126
00:05:04,662 --> 00:05:06,923
Those wild animals in the mountains
will finish them.

127
00:05:07,023 --> 00:05:08,023
Tou Tou,

128
00:05:08,142 --> 00:05:09,982
did you hear what he said?

129
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,961
Was something bothering you?

130
00:05:15,262 --> 00:05:16,262
You couldn't sleep?

131
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,920
I was surfing the web.

132
00:05:18,262 --> 00:05:19,739
I've been tired from work all day.

133
00:05:19,822 --> 00:05:21,542
I need to relax in the evening.

134
00:05:23,303 --> 00:05:24,662
You're not relaxing.

135
00:05:24,855 --> 00:05:26,415
You're slowly killing yourself.

136
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,662
Providing offerings

137
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,023
are merely a ritual,

138
00:05:31,303 --> 00:05:34,303
a yearning and gratitude

139
00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:35,796
towards our ancestors.

140
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,062
The fruit and the snacks

141
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,280
you care about

142
00:05:39,396 --> 00:05:40,595
won't be wasted.

143
00:05:41,023 --> 00:05:42,023
What is superstition?

144
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,500
Superstition is when one does nothing

145
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:46,975
and simply waits for pie
to fall from the sky every day.

146
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,456
We should be good people
and do good deeds.

147
00:05:52,582 --> 00:05:53,663
What is that called?

148
00:05:54,262 --> 00:05:56,045
It's called cultivating
a righteous heart.

149
00:05:57,863 --> 00:05:58,863
Tou Tou.

150
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,662
Take note.
Write down everything I say.

151
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,139
Is your stomach
much better than last time?

152
00:06:08,222 --> 00:06:09,222
Of course.

153
00:06:09,763 --> 00:06:11,274
Since you advised me last year,

154
00:06:11,357 --> 00:06:12,837
I haven't had any ice-cold food.

155
00:06:12,942 --> 00:06:14,542
I don't even dare to drink beer.

156
00:06:14,863 --> 00:06:15,903
You must persist.

157
00:06:17,482 --> 00:06:18,700
I'm not trying to scare you.

158
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,139
If you keep this up,

159
00:06:21,222 --> 00:06:22,901
your liver meridian will explode.

160
00:06:23,075 --> 00:06:23,875
Really?

161
00:06:23,982 --> 00:06:26,382
Plus, you smoke and you drink.

162
00:06:27,135 --> 00:06:30,174
You have to go to bed
before 11pm from now on.

163
00:06:30,262 --> 00:06:31,262
Okay.

164
00:06:31,822 --> 00:06:32,822
Your turn.

165
00:06:36,822 --> 00:06:39,662
-What time do you go to bed?
-No one go to bed early these days.

166
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,421
Will you take a look at this?

167
00:06:53,262 --> 00:06:54,480
Show me your tongue coating.

168
00:06:56,822 --> 00:06:57,996
How do you spell "coating"?

169
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,280
Li Quan,

170
00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:00,627
teach her how to spell that.

171
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,023
Your issues aren't serious.

172
00:07:08,142 --> 00:07:09,447
I will give you a prescription

173
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:12,063
that will treat all of your problems.

174
00:07:12,942 --> 00:07:14,182
Disconnect the WiFi at 10pm.

175
00:07:15,783 --> 00:07:16,783
Did you write it down?

176
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,837
Did you say it?

177
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,312
You didn't say the prescription.

178
00:07:21,503 --> 00:07:22,700
Disconnect the WiFi at 10pm.

179
00:07:22,783 --> 00:07:24,583
-This is the prescription?
-That's right.

180
00:07:24,783 --> 00:07:25,622
This is the prescription?

181
00:07:25,769 --> 00:07:26,769
That's right.

182
00:07:27,142 --> 00:07:28,343
Remember,

183
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:29,822
don't do anything

184
00:07:30,023 --> 00:07:31,583
after ten o'clock.

185
00:07:32,023 --> 00:07:33,343
Just go to bed.

186
00:07:33,903 --> 00:07:37,023
If you sleep well consistently
for three to six months,

187
00:07:37,942 --> 00:07:39,142
most of your ailments

188
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,079
will likely diminish.

189
00:07:41,262 --> 00:07:43,179
You're so humorous, Professor Ren.

190
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:44,743
This is a modern era.

191
00:07:45,262 --> 00:07:47,102
No one goes to bed at 10pm anymore.

192
00:07:48,023 --> 00:07:51,179
It's important to get enough sleep
and wake up early.

193
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,503
It plays a crucial role

194
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,360
in the recovery of your body.

195
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:56,382
Sleep is also a remedy.

196
00:07:56,903 --> 00:07:57,903
Mr. Ren,

197
00:07:58,702 --> 00:08:01,142
the ancients worked at sunrise
and rested at sunset.

198
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,179
Yet their average lifespan
was just around 40 years.

199
00:08:03,262 --> 00:08:05,739
Looks like going to bed early
doesn't necessarily prolong life.

200
00:08:05,822 --> 00:08:07,260
Don't listen to him.

201
00:08:07,343 --> 00:08:08,942
He likes to contradict me.

202
00:08:09,503 --> 00:08:10,503
I don't.

203
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:14,662
The rain has stopped.
Lunch is ready. Let's have lunch.

204
00:08:14,822 --> 00:08:15,700
Let me help you.

205
00:08:15,783 --> 00:08:16,783
Thank you, ma'am.

206
00:08:18,023 --> 00:08:18,820
The food is great.

207
00:08:18,903 --> 00:08:19,739
Yes.

208
00:08:19,822 --> 00:08:21,623
Good. Let's try it.

209
00:08:22,183 --> 00:08:23,183
Have a seat.

210
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,503
Let's dig in.

211
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,942
If a physician

212
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:32,259
indulges in leisure with pleasure
and arrogantly revels in it,

213
00:08:32,342 --> 00:08:34,233
this behavior is considered
disgraceful by both humans and gods.

214
00:08:34,316 --> 00:08:36,379
It's something the noblest individuals
would never do.

215
00:08:36,462 --> 00:08:38,860
These are probably the basic virtues
that a doctor should possess.

216
00:08:38,943 --> 00:08:39,819
Explain it.

217
00:08:39,902 --> 00:08:40,902
Go ahead.

218
00:08:41,943 --> 00:08:42,743
It means that

219
00:08:42,943 --> 00:08:45,183
if someone in a house
is suffering from pain,

220
00:08:45,382 --> 00:08:47,660
then everyone in the house
will be unhappy.

221
00:08:47,743 --> 00:08:50,063
This pain will continue
to accompany the patient.

222
00:08:50,342 --> 00:08:52,263
Especially for a doctor like you,

223
00:08:53,063 --> 00:08:55,259
who at this time is selfishly
worrying about his own stomach

224
00:08:55,342 --> 00:08:56,180
and happiness,

225
00:08:56,263 --> 00:08:58,620
this is absolutely something that
angers both humans and gods.

226
00:08:58,703 --> 00:08:59,782
You get what I mean?

227
00:09:12,503 --> 00:09:13,503
What's wrong, Tou Tou?

228
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:18,084
Come. Let me read your pulse.

229
00:09:29,263 --> 00:09:30,263
Ling Ian,

230
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,049
did you bring brown sugar and ginger?

231
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,750
Yes.

232
00:09:38,063 --> 00:09:39,623
Your feet are cold.

233
00:09:41,383 --> 00:09:44,800
You shouldn't expose your feet
during your menstruation period.

234
00:09:45,462 --> 00:09:46,379
Listen,

235
00:09:46,462 --> 00:09:47,582
starting today,

236
00:09:48,383 --> 00:09:51,063
you have to wear socks
to bed every night.

237
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:53,819
After you go back this time, you have

238
00:09:53,902 --> 00:09:56,143
to drink menstrual pain
reliever soup for two weeks.

239
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,503
Tou,

240
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,919
I left you a bowl of chicken soup.

241
00:10:01,103 --> 00:10:02,282
It's still warm.

242
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:04,510
If you don't want it, I will finish it.

243
00:10:06,143 --> 00:10:07,379
I want it.

244
00:10:07,462 --> 00:10:09,543
Leave it there.
I will go and drink it later.

245
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,000
I can't keep this.

246
00:10:11,703 --> 00:10:12,703
Peng Shi Yan,

247
00:10:12,943 --> 00:10:14,267
this behavior is considered
disgraceful by both humans and gods.

248
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:16,655
It's something the noblest individuals
would never do.

249
00:10:19,462 --> 00:10:20,767
He's drinking my chicken soup.

250
00:10:22,582 --> 00:10:23,620
Just stay here.

251
00:10:23,703 --> 00:10:25,917
But he's drinking my chicken soup.
There is no food left for me.

252
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,819
-I've saved you lunch.
-I saved you...

253
00:10:27,902 --> 00:10:29,337
-Chicken soup?
-Brown sugar water.

254
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,303
Okay.

255
00:10:30,503 --> 00:10:33,063
Finish this.

256
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,640
Tou Tou,

257
00:10:35,143 --> 00:10:36,942
finish this ginger water first.

258
00:10:37,122 --> 00:10:38,862
I will perform acupuncture on you later.

259
00:10:39,063 --> 00:10:40,542
Tian Zhen, bring me my needle bag.

260
00:10:41,022 --> 00:10:42,022
Okay.

261
00:10:52,582 --> 00:10:54,100
I was just about to bring it to you.

262
00:10:54,183 --> 00:10:55,836
-Thank you.
-Have some warm soup.

263
00:10:56,556 --> 00:10:57,730
Let me warm my hands first.

264
00:10:59,263 --> 00:11:00,263
The girl

265
00:11:00,383 --> 00:11:01,423
is really smart.

266
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,440
Despite not having studied
for many years,

267
00:11:03,703 --> 00:11:05,782
she has a good memory.

268
00:11:06,183 --> 00:11:07,863
Just now, she blurted out,

269
00:11:08,383 --> 00:11:09,614
"This behavior is considered
disgraceful by both humans and gods.

270
00:11:09,697 --> 00:11:12,045
It's something the noblest individuals
would never do."

271
00:11:14,523 --> 00:11:15,963
Throughout our lives,

272
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,660
we go through two stages,

273
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:18,740
a sense of existence

274
00:11:18,823 --> 00:11:20,183
and a sense of belonging.

275
00:11:20,757 --> 00:11:21,797
This girl

276
00:11:22,123 --> 00:11:23,323
lacks a sense of belonging,

277
00:11:23,823 --> 00:11:25,860
so she desperately tries
to gain attention,

278
00:11:25,943 --> 00:11:28,223
seeking to feel something.

279
00:11:28,343 --> 00:11:30,822
Actually, being aggressive
or fierce is not her character.

280
00:11:31,063 --> 00:11:32,063
That's right.

281
00:11:34,183 --> 00:11:35,503
I hope we can help her

282
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,959
find a sense of belonging.

283
00:11:40,022 --> 00:11:41,060
Hurry, hurry.

284
00:11:41,143 --> 00:11:42,143
Have some warm soup.

285
00:11:42,822 --> 00:11:44,909
You should leave the mountain
with the car later,

286
00:11:45,183 --> 00:11:46,422
and head home to rest.

287
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:49,183
-Have some.
-No.

288
00:11:52,143 --> 00:11:53,623
-Then...
-No, no.

289
00:11:55,823 --> 00:11:58,209
The weather in this mountain
changes three times a day.

290
00:11:58,703 --> 00:12:00,138
I don't want you to catch a cold.

291
00:12:00,902 --> 00:12:01,939
Don't worry about me.

292
00:12:02,022 --> 00:12:04,143
You must get your cold treated.

293
00:12:04,703 --> 00:12:05,860
It's not uncommon for a cold

294
00:12:05,943 --> 00:12:07,036
to worsen to pneumonia.

295
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,479
I know.

296
00:12:08,635 --> 00:12:11,114
Take care of yourself
and get some rest when you get home.

297
00:12:20,943 --> 00:12:23,063
Students, you've got your schedules.

298
00:12:24,823 --> 00:12:25,823
Starting today,

299
00:12:27,782 --> 00:12:29,823
we will begin

300
00:12:30,462 --> 00:12:31,593
a one-week retreat course.

301
00:12:33,063 --> 00:12:33,980
Prior to this,

302
00:12:34,063 --> 00:12:36,462
we have studied some theories

303
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,201
and practical techniques of acupuncture

304
00:12:40,823 --> 00:12:42,063
in TCM.

305
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,519
From today onward,

306
00:12:45,503 --> 00:12:48,063
we will begin to recite the classics

307
00:12:48,623 --> 00:12:50,060
and establish a connection

308
00:12:50,143 --> 00:12:52,183
with the esteemed ancestors and sages.

309
00:12:52,703 --> 00:12:55,943
Let us cultivate
the habit of diligent study.

310
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:58,343
As you know,

311
00:12:59,022 --> 00:13:02,100
the three months of spring are known as
the season of revival and rejuvenation.

312
00:13:02,183 --> 00:13:04,420
Nature is full of vitality.
All things appear vibrant and thriving.

313
00:13:04,503 --> 00:13:07,823
People sleep early and rise early.
They take walks in the courtyard.

314
00:13:08,462 --> 00:13:12,582
They loosen their hair and relax
their bodies to invigorate the spirit.

315
00:13:13,436 --> 00:13:14,436
March

316
00:13:14,582 --> 00:13:16,365
is the season when life begins to sprout.

317
00:13:16,823 --> 00:13:17,740
We should take advantage

318
00:13:17,823 --> 00:13:19,902
of this period of rejuvenation

319
00:13:20,703 --> 00:13:23,623
and align ourselves with
the growth of Yang energy.

320
00:13:24,462 --> 00:13:25,462
Therefore,

321
00:13:25,943 --> 00:13:27,161
it is important for everyone

322
00:13:27,782 --> 00:13:29,503
to sleep early and rise early.

323
00:13:32,529 --> 00:13:33,329
Mr. Ren,

324
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,039
what hour is considered early
to go to bed and get up?

325
00:13:36,503 --> 00:13:38,102
Is there a standard time?

326
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,740
Ancient people paid great attention
to the division of time.

327
00:13:41,823 --> 00:13:44,620
In the Chinese zodiac, the hour of
"Hai" corresponds to the Pig sign,

328
00:13:44,703 --> 00:13:47,262
specifically from 9pm to 11pm.

329
00:13:47,349 --> 00:13:48,462
During this time period,

330
00:13:49,263 --> 00:13:51,620
pigs sleep most soundly.

331
00:13:51,703 --> 00:13:53,462
I sleep most soundly at the time.

332
00:13:55,263 --> 00:13:56,623
If you haven't gone

333
00:13:57,342 --> 00:13:58,499
to bed in this hour,

334
00:13:58,582 --> 00:13:59,582
then it won't be ideal.

335
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,121
I understand that

336
00:14:01,383 --> 00:14:04,582
asking you to go to bed
at nine o'clock is a little difficult.

337
00:14:05,223 --> 00:14:06,023
Therefore,

338
00:14:06,203 --> 00:14:10,262
let's set a rule that
you should not sleep later than 11pm.

339
00:14:10,462 --> 00:14:11,462
However, remember that

340
00:14:12,503 --> 00:14:13,782
you must wake up

341
00:14:14,022 --> 00:14:15,303
at 5am.

342
00:14:16,503 --> 00:14:19,263
It's time to start studying
and cultivating.

343
00:14:19,623 --> 00:14:21,339
But according to meteorology,

344
00:14:21,422 --> 00:14:22,300
it is said that

345
00:14:22,383 --> 00:14:24,157
to enter spring, the average
temperature must be equal to

346
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,740
or greater than ten degrees Celsius
for five consecutive days.

347
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:27,100
The temperature in this mountain

348
00:14:27,183 --> 00:14:28,939
has definitely not reached spring yet.

349
00:14:29,022 --> 00:14:31,019
Moreover, with such heavy cold
in the morning,

350
00:14:31,102 --> 00:14:33,383
wouldn't it be worse for our health?

351
00:14:33,943 --> 00:14:37,899
Remember, the change of seasons is
not solely determined by temperature.

352
00:14:37,982 --> 00:14:39,263
For example,

353
00:14:39,623 --> 00:14:41,263
this student is a bit slender.

354
00:14:42,143 --> 00:14:44,382
If she puts on multiple layers
of clothing,

355
00:14:44,503 --> 00:14:46,860
she may look very fat,

356
00:14:46,943 --> 00:14:48,943
but the truth is
she is still slender inside.

357
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,480
As you know,

358
00:14:52,263 --> 00:14:55,263
spring has occasional cold snaps,

359
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,420
sometimes even colder than winter.

360
00:14:57,503 --> 00:14:59,743
However, it is still considered spring.

361
00:15:00,022 --> 00:15:01,063
The air is different.

362
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:03,943
I got it.

363
00:15:04,143 --> 00:15:05,740
You can't see it nor touch it.

364
00:15:05,823 --> 00:15:07,389
How do you know if it's here or not?

365
00:15:08,263 --> 00:15:09,263
Pardon me?

366
00:15:10,263 --> 00:15:11,263
The air?

367
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,342
Can you see or touch oxygen?

368
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,289
But you still breathe, don't you?

369
00:15:19,022 --> 00:15:20,823
Students, today,

370
00:15:21,823 --> 00:15:23,084
we are going to start reading

371
00:15:23,236 --> 00:15:24,597
Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic:

372
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,499
Questions of Organic and
Fundamental Nature,

373
00:15:26,582 --> 00:15:28,060
specifically the section

374
00:15:28,143 --> 00:15:30,582
on the Spirit Regulation in Four Seasons.

375
00:15:31,756 --> 00:15:33,459
After everyone has finished
reading this section,

376
00:15:33,542 --> 00:15:36,902
you will have a
better understanding of the air.

377
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:39,623
Nights come very early

378
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:41,250
in the mountains.

379
00:15:41,542 --> 00:15:42,532
Remember, you should adhere

380
00:15:42,615 --> 00:15:45,176
to a routine of sleeping early
and rising early.

381
00:15:45,743 --> 00:15:47,223
Also, starting today,

382
00:15:47,596 --> 00:15:49,727
we will enter into
a secluded training program me.

383
00:15:49,902 --> 00:15:50,902
Class Leader,

384
00:15:51,376 --> 00:15:53,295
you will confiscate

385
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,720
everyone's phone later.

386
00:15:57,662 --> 00:15:59,623
-Hang on...
-From today onward,

387
00:15:59,749 --> 00:16:00,827
I hope that you all

388
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:03,430
will be completely undistracted.

389
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:06,143
Can you not take away our phones?

390
00:16:06,662 --> 00:16:07,662
No.

391
00:16:08,022 --> 00:16:09,797
Why do you want to take away our phones?

392
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:10,819
All right, Class Leader.

393
00:16:10,902 --> 00:16:12,339
Lead everyone to begin reciting

394
00:16:12,422 --> 00:16:13,943
the Virtue of A Great Physician.

395
00:16:14,582 --> 00:16:16,161
Spirit Regulation in Four Seasons.

396
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,743
Spirit Regulation in Four Seasons.

397
00:16:19,022 --> 00:16:19,822
Second.

398
00:16:20,022 --> 00:16:21,339
The three months of spring

399
00:16:21,422 --> 00:16:23,420
are known as the season
of revival and rejuvenation.

400
00:16:23,503 --> 00:16:26,623
Nature is full of vitality.
All things appear vibrant and thriving.

401
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:30,290
People sleep early and rise early.
They take walks in the courtyard.

402
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:33,780
They loosen their hair and relax
their bodies to invigorate the spirit.

403
00:16:33,863 --> 00:16:37,100
Do not kill the living,
give instead of taking.

404
00:16:37,183 --> 00:16:40,579
Reward instead of punishment.
This is the harmony of spring Qi.

405
00:16:40,662 --> 00:16:42,499
It is the way of nurturing life,

406
00:16:42,582 --> 00:16:44,499
going against it will harm the liver.

407
00:16:44,582 --> 00:16:46,215
When cold occurs in summer,

408
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,166
there is little
to support growth of life.

409
00:16:51,943 --> 00:16:52,943
Come.

410
00:17:21,702 --> 00:17:22,702
Mr. Ren,

411
00:17:22,903 --> 00:17:24,063
all phones are collected.

412
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,880
(Qibo Medical Center)

413
00:17:31,302 --> 00:17:32,302
Dr. Song.

414
00:17:32,423 --> 00:17:33,979
-Morning.
-Dr. Song,

415
00:17:34,062 --> 00:17:37,019
there is a mother and daughter there
who insist to see Professor Ren.

416
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:38,877
They've been here even before you left.

417
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,526
They've been waiting for three days.

418
00:17:41,663 --> 00:17:42,820
Didn't you tell them

419
00:17:42,903 --> 00:17:44,300
we were going to Mount Huafeng?

420
00:17:44,383 --> 00:17:45,340
I did. They won't listen.

421
00:17:45,423 --> 00:17:47,858
They insist on waiting here
until they see Professor Ren.

422
00:17:49,182 --> 00:17:50,182
All right. I got it.

423
00:18:01,822 --> 00:18:02,622
Excuse me.

424
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:04,716
Are you here to see Professor Ren?

425
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,073
We heard that

426
00:18:08,156 --> 00:18:10,330
Professor Ren's acupuncture technique
is very good.

427
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,076
So, I brought my girl here to see him.

428
00:18:13,783 --> 00:18:15,062
You came at a bad timing.

429
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:17,222
He took his students to Mount Huafeng.

430
00:18:17,369 --> 00:18:20,009
He will take at least a week to return.

431
00:18:21,023 --> 00:18:21,820
I'm his wife.

432
00:18:21,903 --> 00:18:23,302
I'm a doctor too.

433
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,360
Will you let me

434
00:18:26,543 --> 00:18:28,143
examine the girl first?

435
00:18:28,843 --> 00:18:30,223
(Zhu Xia)

436
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,673
(Ding Jian Xi)

437
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:56,099
(Qibo Medical Center)

438
00:19:56,182 --> 00:19:57,783
It was my birthday.

439
00:19:58,182 --> 00:19:59,543
She sneaked out

440
00:20:00,503 --> 00:20:02,023
to buy me a cake.

441
00:20:02,302 --> 00:20:03,822
She wanted to surprise me.

442
00:20:05,582 --> 00:20:06,942
She was waiting

443
00:20:07,423 --> 00:20:08,822
at a red light by herself.

444
00:20:10,822 --> 00:20:12,302
A terrible accident occurred.

445
00:20:13,062 --> 00:20:14,582
A fast driving car

446
00:20:15,023 --> 00:20:16,543
hit my daughter.

447
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,600
Dr. Song,

448
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:25,423
why do I have to

449
00:20:25,903 --> 00:20:27,302
suffer such a miserable fate?

450
00:20:27,783 --> 00:20:29,942
Her father died early.

451
00:20:31,023 --> 00:20:33,023
I brought her up alone as a widow.

452
00:20:33,543 --> 00:20:35,263
I was afraid that she would be wronged,

453
00:20:35,942 --> 00:20:37,073
so I didn't get remarried.

454
00:20:37,423 --> 00:20:38,822
No one could talk me into it.

455
00:20:41,062 --> 00:20:43,783
I thought my life was finally
getting better.

456
00:20:45,543 --> 00:20:46,543
I don't know

457
00:20:47,182 --> 00:20:48,383
how many bad things

458
00:20:48,783 --> 00:20:50,460
I had done in my past life.

459
00:20:50,543 --> 00:20:52,263
Why is God punishing me like this?

460
00:20:53,023 --> 00:20:56,062
If He wants to punish me,
he should have let the car hit me.

461
00:20:56,903 --> 00:20:57,903
He...

462
00:20:59,023 --> 00:21:01,340
Jian Xi is only 22 years old.

463
00:21:01,423 --> 00:21:03,663
Her good days had not yet begun.

464
00:21:06,062 --> 00:21:06,979
This is all my fault.

465
00:21:07,062 --> 00:21:09,342
Why did I let her go out that day?

466
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:12,903
Zhu Xia,

467
00:21:13,942 --> 00:21:14,942
don't think like that.

468
00:21:19,476 --> 00:21:20,476
I

469
00:21:21,023 --> 00:21:23,182
have a son.

470
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:26,302
He's about the same age as Jian Xi.

471
00:21:27,903 --> 00:21:29,859
I don't think he even remembers

472
00:21:29,942 --> 00:21:30,979
what day my birthday is,

473
00:21:31,062 --> 00:21:33,222
let alone buying me a birthday present.

474
00:21:34,783 --> 00:21:35,783
You see,

475
00:21:36,263 --> 00:21:38,543
Jian Xi is such a good girl,

476
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:40,543
such a good daughter.

477
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:42,510
This is your blessing.

478
00:21:43,062 --> 00:21:44,062
Yes.

479
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,961
Natural and man-made disasters

480
00:21:47,783 --> 00:21:49,663
are beyond our control,

481
00:21:50,423 --> 00:21:51,423
right?

482
00:21:51,783 --> 00:21:54,423
You must not take

483
00:21:55,062 --> 00:21:56,623
all this guilt upon yourself.

484
00:21:58,023 --> 00:21:59,302
Stay strong.

485
00:22:01,002 --> 00:22:02,122
You have to remember that

486
00:22:03,062 --> 00:22:06,143
you are Jian Xi's reliance and hope.

487
00:22:10,503 --> 00:22:11,700
I've shown her X-ray film

488
00:22:11,783 --> 00:22:14,099
to all renowned doctors
in Beijing, Shanghai,

489
00:22:14,182 --> 00:22:15,582
Guangzhou, and Shenzhen.

490
00:22:15,702 --> 00:22:17,302
They've tried everything.

491
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,760
Nothing worked.

492
00:22:20,182 --> 00:22:22,269
She might stay this way
for the rest of her life.

493
00:22:23,062 --> 00:22:24,822
I'm worried about

494
00:22:25,942 --> 00:22:28,820
how she can take care of herself
if I get sick one day.

495
00:22:28,903 --> 00:22:29,903
I mean,

496
00:22:30,143 --> 00:22:32,062
what if I die one day?

497
00:22:32,783 --> 00:22:34,383
Then, Jian Xi will be...

498
00:22:36,062 --> 00:22:37,236
I don't dare to imagine it.

499
00:22:37,423 --> 00:22:38,543
Zhu Xia. Zhu Xia,

500
00:22:39,903 --> 00:22:40,903
I hope

501
00:22:41,822 --> 00:22:43,783
you won't have such thoughts from now on.

502
00:22:45,022 --> 00:22:45,940
I promise you,

503
00:22:46,023 --> 00:22:47,663
we will do everything we can,

504
00:22:47,942 --> 00:22:50,783
but you have to have faith too.

505
00:22:51,062 --> 00:22:51,820
I have faith.

506
00:22:51,903 --> 00:22:53,023
You have to brave.

507
00:25:27,503 --> 00:25:28,503
Where is Tou Tou?

508
00:25:28,663 --> 00:25:30,623
She was still sleeping
when I left the room.

509
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,400
Still sleeping?

510
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,960
Class Leader.

511
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:38,183
Li Quan, go and wake Tou Tou up.

512
00:25:44,143 --> 00:25:45,143
Take this with you.

513
00:25:45,543 --> 00:25:46,700
If she won't get up,

514
00:25:46,783 --> 00:25:47,783
whip her.

515
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Yes, sir.

516
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:03,143
Tou.

517
00:26:04,263 --> 00:26:05,783
Get up to study now.

518
00:26:06,095 --> 00:26:07,095
Wake up.

519
00:26:07,223 --> 00:26:08,863
-Hurry.
-Tou Tou, get up.

520
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,214
Mr. Ren is calling for you.

521
00:26:11,582 --> 00:26:12,582
Get up.

522
00:26:16,903 --> 00:26:18,820
Fine. This is Master's order.

523
00:26:18,903 --> 00:26:19,899
I'm going to hit you

524
00:26:19,982 --> 00:26:21,026
if you don't get up now.

525
00:26:22,903 --> 00:26:23,703
All right.

526
00:26:23,908 --> 00:26:26,869
Three, two, one.

527
00:26:29,702 --> 00:26:31,143
I want to get out of here!

528
00:26:40,423 --> 00:26:41,423
Xin Zheng,

529
00:26:41,543 --> 00:26:43,820
you really have great patience.

530
00:26:43,903 --> 00:26:45,077
It's been a couple of days.

531
00:26:45,423 --> 00:26:46,820
Why did you finally remember to

532
00:26:46,903 --> 00:26:47,990
go see Little Lark today?

533
00:26:48,263 --> 00:26:49,383
I almost thought

534
00:26:49,543 --> 00:26:50,543
you were giving up.

535
00:26:51,143 --> 00:26:53,019
We're here for closed-door training,

536
00:26:53,102 --> 00:26:55,062
not catching up with an old friend.

537
00:26:55,302 --> 00:26:56,099
Save it.

538
00:26:56,182 --> 00:26:57,820
So why do you have time
to call me here today?

539
00:26:57,903 --> 00:26:59,582
We're leaving in two days.

540
00:26:59,783 --> 00:27:01,503
What should be done must be done.

541
00:27:06,582 --> 00:27:07,582
Xin Zheng,

542
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:10,730
we are going to knock on
the door of your old crush.

543
00:27:11,302 --> 00:27:14,580
If the one who opens the door
is your old crush,

544
00:27:14,663 --> 00:27:16,982
this will be a timeless tale then.

545
00:27:22,582 --> 00:27:23,982
She is a hermit,

546
00:27:25,383 --> 00:27:28,302
who has transcended
the boundaries of gender.

547
00:27:42,543 --> 00:27:43,543
Please come in.

548
00:27:50,876 --> 00:27:53,197
We were looking for an old friend.

549
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,477
Thank you for your time.

550
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,219
I might not be the one
you're looking for,

551
00:27:58,302 --> 00:28:00,820
but you are the one I'm looking for.

552
00:28:00,903 --> 00:28:01,903
I know you.

553
00:28:19,423 --> 00:28:20,820
Tou Tou is so obedient today.

554
00:28:20,903 --> 00:28:21,979
She went to bed so early.

555
00:28:22,062 --> 00:28:23,062
I know, right?

556
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,679
She snores so loudly.

557
00:28:25,023 --> 00:28:27,036
Who will share a bed
with her in the future?

558
00:28:27,543 --> 00:28:28,543
Us.

559
00:28:48,582 --> 00:28:49,783
Why are you still awake?

560
00:28:51,942 --> 00:28:55,062
I can't sleep
without Tou Tou snoring now.

561
00:29:03,503 --> 00:29:04,503
Tou Tou,

562
00:29:04,942 --> 00:29:06,638
Don't cover your head with the blanket.

563
00:29:09,942 --> 00:29:11,623
Get up. Tou Tou is gone.

564
00:29:12,302 --> 00:29:13,302
Get up now.

565
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,440
Tou Tou is gone.

566
00:29:25,383 --> 00:29:26,383
Every day,

567
00:29:27,903 --> 00:29:30,469
I get up earlier than a rooster
and eat less than a rooster.

568
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,340
What will be left of me

569
00:29:32,423 --> 00:29:33,702
by the time we can go back?

570
00:29:34,383 --> 00:29:35,383
They want me to learn

571
00:29:35,783 --> 00:29:36,783
and write calligraphy.

572
00:29:37,182 --> 00:29:38,182
Look at me.

573
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,513
Do I look like someone

574
00:29:39,596 --> 00:29:41,263
who studies and writes calligraphy?

575
00:29:41,582 --> 00:29:43,499
I want to eat and drink.

576
00:29:43,582 --> 00:29:44,783
Once I get out of here,

577
00:29:45,263 --> 00:29:46,302
I'll eat and drink

578
00:29:46,822 --> 00:29:47,822
as much as I want.

579
00:29:48,302 --> 00:29:49,433
I will play with my phone.

580
00:29:49,543 --> 00:29:50,717
I will play all night long.

581
00:29:50,903 --> 00:29:52,420
I will stay up all night.

582
00:29:52,503 --> 00:29:53,303
Yes.

583
00:29:53,543 --> 00:29:55,062
Why should I cultivate everyday?

584
00:29:55,903 --> 00:29:57,102
I'm such a smart girl.

585
00:29:57,783 --> 00:29:58,583
I'll just...

586
00:29:58,822 --> 00:30:00,583
I... I'll just...

587
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,460
I'll just eat and drink whatever I want.

588
00:30:06,836 --> 00:30:08,002
You can't control me now!

589
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,799
I'm free!

590
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,159
There is another slope.

591
00:30:47,942 --> 00:30:49,725
Why do I feel like I've been here before?

592
00:30:54,423 --> 00:30:55,467
I will set this up here.

593
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,684
Where is the red string?

594
00:31:10,503 --> 00:31:12,330
How come I don't see
any of the red strings

595
00:31:12,663 --> 00:31:13,822
tied by Ling Ian?

596
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,999
Why am I walking on another slope?

597
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,783
How... How...

598
00:31:19,636 --> 00:31:20,636
How is this...

599
00:31:24,516 --> 00:31:25,756
I set this up, didn't I?

600
00:31:26,543 --> 00:31:28,663
This is simply a maze!

601
00:31:29,582 --> 00:31:31,143
Is there anyone?

602
00:31:31,743 --> 00:31:32,743
What should I do?

603
00:31:34,663 --> 00:31:35,903
I give up. I...

604
00:31:36,663 --> 00:31:38,019
I give up!

605
00:31:38,102 --> 00:31:39,302
I'm so unlucky!

606
00:31:39,423 --> 00:31:40,423
Unlucky!

607
00:31:41,143 --> 00:31:42,062
Unlucky!

608
00:31:42,182 --> 00:31:43,182
Unlucky!

609
00:31:43,783 --> 00:31:44,783
Unlucky!

610
00:31:49,642 --> 00:31:50,642
What should I do?

611
00:31:54,822 --> 00:31:56,257
I'll wait until the sun comes up.

612
00:31:56,783 --> 00:31:57,783
Wait until sunrise.

613
00:31:58,663 --> 00:31:59,707
I can't get out of here.

614
00:32:21,783 --> 00:32:22,783
I'm exhausted.

615
00:33:01,023 --> 00:33:02,241
Where do the bees come from?

616
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,160
No! No!

617
00:33:06,623 --> 00:33:08,462
Get away from me!

618
00:33:08,702 --> 00:33:10,182
Get away!

619
00:33:10,783 --> 00:33:11,540
Back off!

620
00:33:11,623 --> 00:33:13,383
Back off! Back off!

621
00:33:14,623 --> 00:33:15,623
Help!

622
00:33:17,576 --> 00:33:18,576
Help!

623
00:33:18,863 --> 00:33:19,863
Help!

624
00:33:20,342 --> 00:33:21,623
Help! Help!

625
00:33:26,822 --> 00:33:27,822
Tou Tou?

626
00:33:29,182 --> 00:33:30,182
Somebody!

627
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:31,499
-I'm here.
-What's wrong?

628
00:33:31,582 --> 00:33:33,219
I'm here. I'm here.

629
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:34,540
There are hornets.

630
00:33:34,623 --> 00:33:35,540
There are hornets.

631
00:33:35,623 --> 00:33:36,420
-Calm down.
-Let me handle it.

632
00:33:36,503 --> 00:33:37,503
Don't be afraid.

633
00:33:38,423 --> 00:33:39,423
Spray them.

634
00:33:42,863 --> 00:33:44,502
-Are you done?
-Yes, yes.

635
00:33:44,863 --> 00:33:45,950
It's okay now. It's okay.

636
00:33:48,423 --> 00:33:49,942
Come, Tou Tou.

637
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,320
Tou Tou, are you okay?

638
00:33:52,023 --> 00:33:53,023
I'm fine, I'm fine.

639
00:33:53,503 --> 00:33:54,997
-I'm fine, I'm fine.
-It's okay now.

640
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:55,880
It's okay now.

641
00:33:56,143 --> 00:33:57,143
The hornets are gone.

642
00:33:57,863 --> 00:33:59,063
-Are you okay?
-Let me see.

643
00:34:02,023 --> 00:34:03,023
Your face are swollen.

644
00:34:06,308 --> 00:34:07,589
Why are you laughing?

645
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,920
How can you laugh?

646
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:12,860
A great physician must be calm in spirit,

647
00:34:12,943 --> 00:34:13,820
free from desires.

648
00:34:13,903 --> 00:34:16,582
He must first have a compassionate heart

649
00:34:16,856 --> 00:34:18,060
and be committed to relieving
the sufferings of all people.

650
00:34:18,143 --> 00:34:19,300
Relieving the sufferings of all people.

651
00:34:19,383 --> 00:34:20,689
How can you laugh?

652
00:34:21,262 --> 00:34:22,784
You can never be a great physician!

653
00:34:23,062 --> 00:34:24,663
You've become so articulate now.

654
00:34:25,262 --> 00:34:26,062
Master.

655
00:34:26,183 --> 00:34:27,019
I'm here, Tou Tou.

656
00:34:27,102 --> 00:34:27,979
Where?

657
00:34:28,062 --> 00:34:29,062
This side.

658
00:34:30,502 --> 00:34:32,623
You were going to leave, weren't you?

659
00:34:33,542 --> 00:34:34,542
All right.

660
00:34:35,342 --> 00:34:37,142
It's good that you are still alive.

661
00:34:38,383 --> 00:34:40,142
-You can leave now.
-No, no, Master!

662
00:34:40,623 --> 00:34:41,423
I'm staying.

663
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:43,262
I'm staying. Really, I'm staying.

664
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:45,062
I am very,

665
00:34:45,262 --> 00:34:46,383
very grateful that

666
00:34:46,582 --> 00:34:48,143
the four of you came to find me.

667
00:34:48,542 --> 00:34:49,542
Because today,

668
00:34:50,022 --> 00:34:51,022
I went from there

669
00:34:51,183 --> 00:34:52,183
to here...

670
00:34:53,542 --> 00:34:55,663
There are only two of us here.

671
00:34:58,542 --> 00:35:00,822
Oh, my God! This is killing me!

672
00:35:01,703 --> 00:35:03,062
I'm really...

673
00:35:03,341 --> 00:35:06,540
My head is buzzing now.

674
00:35:06,623 --> 00:35:08,179
And, I really...

675
00:35:08,262 --> 00:35:09,259
I'm really staying.

676
00:35:09,342 --> 00:35:11,259
I will practice calligraphy well,

677
00:35:11,342 --> 00:35:12,540
read well

678
00:35:12,623 --> 00:35:14,780
and cultivate well.

679
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:16,623
-So, you are really staying?
-Yes!

680
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,841
I'm staying.

681
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,300
Will you doze off again
when you are studying?

682
00:35:21,383 --> 00:35:22,383
No.

683
00:35:22,582 --> 00:35:23,540
Will you doze off again
when you are cultivating?

684
00:35:23,623 --> 00:35:24,423
No.

685
00:35:24,582 --> 00:35:26,365
-Will you practice your calligraphy?
-Yes.

686
00:35:26,782 --> 00:35:28,939
If you do it again next time,
I won't come find you.

687
00:35:29,022 --> 00:35:30,623
There won't be a next time at all.

688
00:35:31,383 --> 00:35:32,183
Next time...

689
00:35:32,383 --> 00:35:33,663
-Next time...
-Let's go.

690
00:35:34,502 --> 00:35:36,780
I feel like I've been stung
on my tongue too.

691
00:35:36,863 --> 00:35:38,259
My tongue has been stung.

692
00:35:38,342 --> 00:35:40,983
-All right now, let's go.
-This is killing me.

693
00:35:42,102 --> 00:35:43,782
And my tongue.

694
00:35:44,903 --> 00:35:46,641
-Your tongue is going numb too?
-Yes.

695
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:49,103
Look at this. Look.

696
00:35:49,196 --> 00:35:51,805
It's clearly marked as the right way,
and you didn't take it.

697
00:35:53,143 --> 00:35:54,143
Look.

698
00:35:54,582 --> 00:35:55,974
You chose the wrong way instead.

699
00:35:57,782 --> 00:35:58,863
-Come on.
-Okay.

700
00:35:59,003 --> 00:36:00,003
Wait.

701
00:36:00,143 --> 00:36:01,342
Stop looking. Just walk.

702
00:36:07,342 --> 00:36:08,342
Come on.

703
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,760
The hornets are here.

704
00:36:21,502 --> 00:36:22,502
What's wrong?

705
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,680
It's so cold.

706
00:36:28,623 --> 00:36:29,703
You reminded me.

707
00:36:30,542 --> 00:36:32,342
I should use something warmer.

708
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,720
Do any of you have pee?

709
00:36:40,062 --> 00:36:41,062
Pee?

710
00:36:41,342 --> 00:36:42,142
That's right.

711
00:36:42,262 --> 00:36:43,703
Go and pee. Bring it over.

712
00:36:44,183 --> 00:36:45,340
I make it into a paste.

713
00:36:45,423 --> 00:36:46,623
It's warmer that way.

714
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,120
Master,

715
00:36:56,302 --> 00:36:57,737
it's fine. It's not cold anymore.

716
00:36:58,423 --> 00:37:00,062
I'm feeling quite comfortable.

717
00:37:00,262 --> 00:37:01,262
No.

718
00:37:01,663 --> 00:37:02,699
You just reminded me.

719
00:37:02,782 --> 00:37:04,179
My master told me

720
00:37:04,262 --> 00:37:05,062
that urine

721
00:37:05,342 --> 00:37:07,022
is a good antidote to poison.

722
00:37:10,502 --> 00:37:11,502
Mr. Ren.

723
00:37:14,116 --> 00:37:15,423
Slow down, slow down.

724
00:37:16,703 --> 00:37:17,790
Don't get it on my hands.

725
00:37:19,502 --> 00:37:20,502
Master.

726
00:37:21,022 --> 00:37:22,503
-Yes?
-I...

727
00:37:23,382 --> 00:37:25,223
Is it too late for me?

728
00:37:25,703 --> 00:37:26,703
No.

729
00:37:27,863 --> 00:37:29,062
It will be too late for you

730
00:37:29,342 --> 00:37:30,456
if you are feeling dizzy.

731
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:32,542
I'm feeling dizzy now.

732
00:37:33,262 --> 00:37:35,262
Even if you're dizzy,
I can still cure you.

733
00:37:35,409 --> 00:37:37,290
As long as you are not short of breath,

734
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,160
I can cure you.

735
00:37:41,423 --> 00:37:43,062
I feel like I'm short of breath.

736
00:37:43,582 --> 00:37:44,782
I feel like

737
00:37:45,582 --> 00:37:46,582
I'm being...

738
00:37:47,143 --> 00:37:48,143
I'm being...

739
00:37:49,582 --> 00:37:51,502
Shush, shush.

740
00:37:52,623 --> 00:37:53,623
Dad,

741
00:37:54,535 --> 00:37:56,335
Tou Tou really passed out.

742
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,201
She's not passed out.

743
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,903
She is tired and frightened.

744
00:38:06,262 --> 00:38:07,262
She fell asleep.

745
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,599
She's really something.

746
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,019
We've been tirelessly
searching all night for her.

747
00:38:11,102 --> 00:38:12,842
Look at her. She fell asleep right away.

748
00:38:13,062 --> 00:38:13,903
That's right.

749
00:38:14,143 --> 00:38:15,143
Unbelievable.

750
00:38:16,342 --> 00:38:17,342
Students,

751
00:38:17,703 --> 00:38:20,983
our final lesson during seclusion
is to practice footwork.

752
00:38:21,782 --> 00:38:24,782
And you finished it tonight.

753
00:38:25,423 --> 00:38:27,542
We'll leave here early tomorrow morning.

754
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,400
Yes, Mr. Ren.

755
00:38:32,863 --> 00:38:33,863
Tian Zhen,

756
00:38:34,262 --> 00:38:35,540
apply the rest on her face.

757
00:38:35,623 --> 00:38:36,983
Okay, okay.

758
00:38:37,542 --> 00:38:39,183
-Be gentle.
-Okay.

759
00:38:47,502 --> 00:38:48,602
Don't remove the blanket.

760
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,200
Tian Zhen,

761
00:38:51,623 --> 00:38:52,623
will this work?

762
00:38:53,542 --> 00:38:54,542
Yes.

763
00:38:54,782 --> 00:38:56,223
-Trust my dad.
-Do...

764
00:38:56,383 --> 00:38:58,062
-Do you need more of this?
-No.

765
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,739
You really do come from a wealthy
and influential family, Prince Ren.

766
00:39:14,822 --> 00:39:16,582
I was too kind to you before.

767
00:39:17,102 --> 00:39:19,979
Quan, he will pay for our meals
from now on.

768
00:39:20,062 --> 00:39:21,062
Freeload off him.

769
00:39:21,342 --> 00:39:23,100
This is my grandpa's medical center,
not mine.

770
00:39:23,183 --> 00:39:24,499
Listen to yourself.

771
00:39:24,582 --> 00:39:26,887
-It will be yours one day, won't it?
-I don't need it.

772
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,459
Besides, there is no explicit rule

773
00:39:28,542 --> 00:39:30,342
stating that this must be
passed on to me.

774
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,960
Listen to him.

775
00:39:32,623 --> 00:39:33,979
Who else will it be passed on to
if not you?

776
00:39:34,062 --> 00:39:35,580
You just don't appreciate what you have.

777
00:39:35,663 --> 00:39:36,463
I'm telling you,

778
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:37,974
it's such a nice medical center.

779
00:39:38,502 --> 00:39:40,423
I'd be over the moon

780
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:41,998
if it could be passed on to me.

781
00:39:42,081 --> 00:39:43,197
You two are so weird.

782
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,134
What does my grandparents'
and my parents' stuff

783
00:39:45,217 --> 00:39:46,257
have to do with me?

784
00:39:46,542 --> 00:39:47,820
And it was not my choice

785
00:39:47,903 --> 00:39:49,422
to be their offspring.

786
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,580
You both talk as if I was blessed
with to have these advantages.

787
00:39:51,663 --> 00:39:52,463
Maybe you should try

788
00:39:52,582 --> 00:39:53,939
standing beneath
this ancestral legacy yourself.

789
00:39:54,022 --> 00:39:55,179
If you don't strive to grow,

790
00:39:55,262 --> 00:39:57,132
you won't even be able
to see the sun above.

791
00:39:59,062 --> 00:40:01,062
I got something to say.
Gather round, students.

792
00:40:01,502 --> 00:40:02,300
Class,

793
00:40:02,383 --> 00:40:03,463
gather round.

794
00:40:06,542 --> 00:40:08,325
-What's wrong, Tou Tou?
-My legs are numb.

795
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,800
You knee led too long.

796
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:13,010
Class,

797
00:40:13,423 --> 00:40:16,302
practice is the sole criterion
for testing truth.

798
00:40:17,022 --> 00:40:19,019
Previously, we have basically concluded

799
00:40:19,102 --> 00:40:20,863
the lessons on TCM theory.

800
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,140
So, from now on, you will learn
and help out

801
00:40:23,223 --> 00:40:25,739
at the medical center on weekdays.

802
00:40:25,822 --> 00:40:28,623
We will continue with
the apprentice class on weekends.

803
00:40:30,863 --> 00:40:33,783
Am I going to do acupuncture
or prepare herbal medicine?

804
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,134
You are sweeping the floor.

805
00:40:38,623 --> 00:40:39,822
During this period,

806
00:40:40,022 --> 00:40:42,783
we will invite influential teachers

807
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:46,303
from different schools

808
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:48,343
and with different specialties

809
00:40:48,483 --> 00:40:49,580
to give you lectures.

810
00:40:49,663 --> 00:40:51,580
We hope that everyone of you

811
00:40:51,663 --> 00:40:53,820
can find out a field that you like

812
00:40:53,903 --> 00:40:55,860
and is most suitable for you

813
00:40:55,943 --> 00:40:58,463
during this learning period.

814
00:41:00,582 --> 00:41:01,620
You don't have a choice.

815
00:41:01,703 --> 00:41:03,022
You'll just have to follow me.

816
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:07,867
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

817
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:09,354
(are referenced from relevant
traditional Chinese medicine books)

818
00:41:09,437 --> 00:41:11,742
(Do not use without medical advice)
