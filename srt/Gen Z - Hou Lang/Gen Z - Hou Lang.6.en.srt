1
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,920
(Gen Z)

2
00:01:35,734 --> 00:01:37,734
(Episode 6)

3
00:01:40,823 --> 00:01:42,956
Next, we will recite
the Virtue of A Great Physician

4
00:01:43,623 --> 00:01:45,302
in front of Dr. Huang's grave.

5
00:01:46,323 --> 00:01:47,442
To console our ancestors,

6
00:01:47,542 --> 00:01:48,623
carry on the legacy,

7
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,461
remain true to our original aspirations,
save lives and heal the injured.

8
00:01:51,562 --> 00:01:52,735
These are our aspirations.

9
00:01:53,782 --> 00:01:55,422
The Virtue of A Great Physician...

10
00:01:55,503 --> 00:01:56,663
Do you think he can

11
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,840
hear you reciting these?

12
00:01:58,942 --> 00:02:00,301
Do you really think

13
00:02:00,382 --> 00:02:02,382
he can hear you reciting these?

14
00:02:03,823 --> 00:02:04,743
He can't, can he?

15
00:02:06,183 --> 00:02:08,542
In this case, I think
Western medicine is better.

16
00:02:08,702 --> 00:02:11,062
At least Western medicine practitioners
don't have to do something like this.

17
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,583
Look at you bunch.

18
00:02:13,063 --> 00:02:14,662
Western medicine practitioners
have to take an oath too.

19
00:02:14,862 --> 00:02:16,063
The Hippocratic Oath.

20
00:02:16,943 --> 00:02:18,702
Fine. You are all the same.

21
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:20,702
You said the oath for yourself.

22
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,462
Just like when people get married,

23
00:02:22,543 --> 00:02:25,103
they say "I will love you
for the rest of my life."

24
00:02:25,863 --> 00:02:27,303
"I will love you
for the rest of my life."

25
00:02:27,343 --> 00:02:29,142
In the end, it's just a lie.

26
00:02:30,983 --> 00:02:32,296
Have you never visited a grave?

27
00:02:32,622 --> 00:02:34,742
Have you not attended
any memorial service?

28
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,903
Won't it bother you
if someone is being so impolite

29
00:02:36,983 --> 00:02:38,443
in front of your family's grave?

30
00:02:46,063 --> 00:02:48,263
I have no family,
so I have never visited any graves.

31
00:02:48,783 --> 00:02:49,622
I'm an orphan.

32
00:02:50,576 --> 00:02:52,176
I grew up in an orphanage.

33
00:02:52,703 --> 00:02:54,262
I've never seen a ceremony like this.

34
00:02:54,856 --> 00:02:56,617
The biggest ceremony I've ever attended

35
00:02:56,983 --> 00:02:58,743
was every time there was an open house,

36
00:02:59,063 --> 00:03:01,103
every child would sit at the front door

37
00:03:01,783 --> 00:03:02,703
with a red headband,

38
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,440
waiting for the adoptive parents

39
00:03:04,536 --> 00:03:05,457
to come and adopt us.

40
00:03:05,783 --> 00:03:06,583
As time passed,

41
00:03:07,063 --> 00:03:08,862
the obedient children were adopted.

42
00:03:09,502 --> 00:03:11,143
The disobedient ones were also adopted.

43
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,041
Even the sick ones were adopted,

44
00:03:15,063 --> 00:03:16,143
but no one wanted me.

45
00:03:17,983 --> 00:03:19,063
For me, my closest families

46
00:03:19,222 --> 00:03:20,703
are the women

47
00:03:21,109 --> 00:03:22,109
who took care of me

48
00:03:23,582 --> 00:03:24,703
in the orphanage.

49
00:03:25,502 --> 00:03:26,302
Tou Tou,

50
00:03:27,423 --> 00:03:28,223
I'm sorry.

51
00:03:28,983 --> 00:03:31,622
Rebecca didn't know
about your background.

52
00:03:39,143 --> 00:03:40,336
I was just messing with you.

53
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,840
You...

54
00:03:47,423 --> 00:03:48,503
Is it fun to lie?

55
00:03:49,343 --> 00:03:51,063
What else can you do besides lying?

56
00:03:51,863 --> 00:03:53,902
You are like a dandelion.
You are rootless.

57
00:03:54,143 --> 00:03:56,423
But we all have our
own families and ancestors.

58
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,762
Even if you don't understand this,
don't agree with this,

59
00:03:58,843 --> 00:04:00,036
can't you just stay silent?

60
00:04:00,783 --> 00:04:03,583
Or do you think you can seek pity
or sympathy by behaving like this?

61
00:04:05,863 --> 00:04:06,943
I don't need pity

62
00:04:07,503 --> 00:04:08,822
nor sympathy.

63
00:04:09,703 --> 00:04:10,902
I just think,

64
00:04:11,703 --> 00:04:12,863
you know what this is called?

65
00:04:14,143 --> 00:04:15,583
Gathering for superstitious beliefs.

66
00:04:15,863 --> 00:04:16,663
Got it?

67
00:04:17,228 --> 00:04:18,228
A bunch of people

68
00:04:19,063 --> 00:04:20,102
put a bunch of stuff

69
00:04:20,943 --> 00:04:22,822
in front of a deceased person.

70
00:04:22,903 --> 00:04:25,823
Do you know that many people
do not have enough to eat or drink?

71
00:04:26,223 --> 00:04:27,783
Do you know
what this looks like to me?

72
00:04:27,943 --> 00:04:29,223
You are wasting food.

73
00:04:30,023 --> 00:04:32,222
I really don't understand
what you are thinking.

74
00:04:32,423 --> 00:04:33,303
You just stand here

75
00:04:33,503 --> 00:04:34,303
and recite poems.

76
00:04:34,575 --> 00:04:36,503
You really think he can hear you?

77
00:04:37,542 --> 00:04:39,822
You are reciting something
people don't even understand.

78
00:04:40,343 --> 00:04:41,662
The Virtue of A Great Physician.

79
00:04:41,743 --> 00:04:43,463
The Virtue of A Great Physician.

80
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,862
What's point of this?

81
00:04:45,943 --> 00:04:47,662
It's not like he's your own family

82
00:04:47,822 --> 00:04:50,262
He wasn't related to you.
And you're paying respect to him.

83
00:04:50,703 --> 00:04:52,143
Seriously.

84
00:04:52,703 --> 00:04:55,583
Present illnesses may have internal
similarities but external differences,

85
00:04:55,696 --> 00:04:58,056
and likewise, they may have internal
differences but external similarities.

86
00:04:58,262 --> 00:05:00,983
Therefore, the fullness
or deficiency of the organs

87
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,600
and the obstruction or smooth flow
of the blood vessels affect each other.

88
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,521
The slope is quite steep.

89
00:05:11,223 --> 00:05:12,581
You guys do this every year.

90
00:05:12,688 --> 00:05:13,983
You walk this path every year.

91
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,541
-Professor Ren.
-Everyone's here?

92
00:05:16,622 --> 00:05:18,702
You guys came much
earlier than last year, right?

93
00:05:19,262 --> 00:05:20,862
No. Every year,

94
00:05:20,943 --> 00:05:22,983
you all come earlier than me.

95
00:05:24,662 --> 00:05:26,262
Yes, yes. You must be tired.

96
00:05:26,343 --> 00:05:27,503
The food is ready.

97
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,581
We can have lunch soon.

98
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:30,983
Okay. Thank you, thank you.

99
00:05:31,262 --> 00:05:32,062
Tian Zhen,

100
00:05:32,943 --> 00:05:34,276
these are your dad's patients?

101
00:05:35,382 --> 00:05:37,223
They are folks from nearby villages.

102
00:05:37,304 --> 00:05:39,223
They know we would come to the
mountain every year to visit the grave,

103
00:05:39,304 --> 00:05:41,301
so they would clean the room

104
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:42,515
and cook for us in advance.

105
00:05:42,622 --> 00:05:45,309
My parents would also take
the opportunity to check their health.

106
00:05:45,943 --> 00:05:46,822
-It's good.
-Let's go.

107
00:05:56,262 --> 00:05:58,262
As I told you before,

108
00:05:58,463 --> 00:05:59,342
take this decoction

109
00:06:00,423 --> 00:06:02,463
three times a day.

110
00:06:02,703 --> 00:06:04,062
Take it half an hour after meals.

111
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,256
The prescription last time
was good.

112
00:06:06,337 --> 00:06:07,421
It worked very well.

113
00:06:07,502 --> 00:06:09,262
-Good.
-Thank you.

114
00:06:09,342 --> 00:06:10,142
It's nothing.

115
00:06:10,382 --> 00:06:11,822
We left a lot of food

116
00:06:12,102 --> 00:06:13,782
on the grave just now.

117
00:06:15,423 --> 00:06:17,782
Professor Ren, don't worry.
It won't be wasted.

118
00:06:18,335 --> 00:06:20,000
When life is difficult,

119
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,240
the folks are taking them
home as rations.

120
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,742
Although the offering is
for worshiping the ancestors,

121
00:06:25,822 --> 00:06:27,476
they are merely symbolic gestures.

122
00:06:27,566 --> 00:06:29,588
The offerings taste better than
the usual food.

123
00:06:29,743 --> 00:06:30,942
Why would we waste them?

124
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:32,229
How's your life?

125
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,462
There is no need to ask.

126
00:06:34,542 --> 00:06:36,095
Everyday is like Chinese New Year.

127
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,855
Those wild animals in the mountains
will finish them.

128
00:06:39,782 --> 00:06:41,342
Those wild animals in the mountains
will finish them.

129
00:06:42,143 --> 00:06:42,943
Tou Tou,

130
00:06:43,262 --> 00:06:45,102
did you hear what he said?

131
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,081
Was something bothering you?

132
00:06:50,382 --> 00:06:51,262
You couldn't sleep?

133
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,920
I was surfing the web.

134
00:06:53,382 --> 00:06:54,861
I've been tired from work all day.

135
00:06:54,942 --> 00:06:56,662
I need to relax in the evening.

136
00:06:58,423 --> 00:06:59,782
You're not relaxing.

137
00:06:59,975 --> 00:07:01,535
You're slowly killing yourself.

138
00:07:02,543 --> 00:07:03,782
Providing offerings

139
00:07:04,782 --> 00:07:06,143
are merely a ritual,

140
00:07:06,423 --> 00:07:09,423
a yearning and gratitude

141
00:07:09,755 --> 00:07:10,916
towards our ancestors.

142
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,182
The fruit and the snacks

143
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,400
you care about

144
00:07:14,516 --> 00:07:15,715
won't be wasted.

145
00:07:16,143 --> 00:07:17,143
What is superstition?

146
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,610
Superstition is when one does nothing

147
00:07:19,703 --> 00:07:22,064
and simply waits for pie
to fall from the sky every day.

148
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,576
We should be good people
and do good deeds.

149
00:07:27,702 --> 00:07:28,783
What is that called?

150
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:31,161
It's called cultivating
a righteous heart.

151
00:07:32,983 --> 00:07:33,830
Tou Tou.

152
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,782
Take note.
Write down everything I say.

153
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,262
Is your stomach
much better than last time?

154
00:07:43,342 --> 00:07:44,222
Of course.

155
00:07:44,883 --> 00:07:46,396
Since you advised me last year,

156
00:07:46,477 --> 00:07:47,957
I haven't had any ice-cold food.

157
00:07:48,062 --> 00:07:49,662
I don't even dare to drink beer.

158
00:07:49,983 --> 00:07:51,023
You must persist.

159
00:07:52,602 --> 00:07:53,803
I'm not trying to scare you.

160
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,262
If you keep this up,

161
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:58,021
your liver meridian will explode.

162
00:07:58,195 --> 00:07:58,995
Really?

163
00:07:59,102 --> 00:08:01,502
Plus, you smoke and you drink.

164
00:08:02,255 --> 00:08:05,294
You have to go to bed
before 11pm from now on.

165
00:08:05,382 --> 00:08:06,382
Okay.

166
00:08:06,942 --> 00:08:07,863
Your turn.

167
00:08:11,942 --> 00:08:14,782
-What time do you go to bed?
-No one go to bed early these days.

168
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,503
Will you take a look at this?

169
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:29,595
Show me your tongue coating.

170
00:08:31,942 --> 00:08:33,062
How do you spell "coating"?

171
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,400
Li Quan,

172
00:08:34,529 --> 00:08:35,650
teach her how to spell that.

173
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,143
Your issues aren't serious.

174
00:08:43,262 --> 00:08:44,368
I will give you a prescription

175
00:08:44,703 --> 00:08:47,183
that will treat all of your problems.

176
00:08:48,062 --> 00:08:49,302
Disconnect the wifi at 10pm.

177
00:08:50,903 --> 00:08:51,703
Did you write it down?

178
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:54,959
Did you say it?

179
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,406
You didn't say the prescription.

180
00:08:56,623 --> 00:08:57,823
Disconnect the wifi at 10pm.

181
00:08:57,903 --> 00:08:59,703
-This is the prescription?
-That's right.

182
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,742
This is the prescription?

183
00:09:00,889 --> 00:09:01,689
That's right.

184
00:09:02,262 --> 00:09:03,463
Remember,

185
00:09:03,703 --> 00:09:04,942
don't do anything

186
00:09:05,143 --> 00:09:06,703
after ten o'clock.

187
00:09:07,143 --> 00:09:08,463
Just go to bed.

188
00:09:09,023 --> 00:09:12,143
If you sleep well consistently
for three to six months,

189
00:09:13,062 --> 00:09:14,262
most of your ailments

190
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,199
will likely diminish.

191
00:09:16,382 --> 00:09:18,302
You're so humorous, Professor Ren.

192
00:09:18,382 --> 00:09:19,863
This is a modern era.

193
00:09:20,382 --> 00:09:22,222
No one goes to bed at 10pm anymore.

194
00:09:23,143 --> 00:09:26,302
It's important to get enough sleep
and wake up early.

195
00:09:26,382 --> 00:09:27,623
It plays a crucial role

196
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,480
in the recovery of your body.

197
00:09:29,703 --> 00:09:31,502
Sleep is also a remedy.

198
00:09:32,023 --> 00:09:32,823
Mr. Ren,

199
00:09:33,822 --> 00:09:36,262
the ancients worked at sunrise
and rested at sunset.

200
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,320
Yet their average lifespan
was just around 40 years.

201
00:09:38,382 --> 00:09:40,862
Looks like going to bed early
doesn't necessarily prolong life.

202
00:09:40,942 --> 00:09:42,383
Don't listen to him.

203
00:09:42,463 --> 00:09:44,062
He likes to contradict me.

204
00:09:44,623 --> 00:09:45,623
I don't.

205
00:09:47,249 --> 00:09:49,782
The rain has stopped.
Lunch is ready. Let's have lunch.

206
00:09:49,942 --> 00:09:50,823
Let me help you.

207
00:09:50,903 --> 00:09:51,703
Thank you, ma'am.

208
00:09:53,143 --> 00:09:53,943
The food is great.

209
00:09:54,023 --> 00:09:54,862
Yes.

210
00:09:54,942 --> 00:09:56,743
Good. Let's try it.

211
00:09:57,303 --> 00:09:58,103
Have a seat.

212
00:09:58,623 --> 00:09:59,423
Let's dig in.

213
00:10:03,023 --> 00:10:04,062
If a physician

214
00:10:04,703 --> 00:10:07,382
indulges in leisure with pleasure
and arrogantly revels in it,

215
00:10:07,462 --> 00:10:09,303
this behavior is considered
disgraceful by both humans and gods.

216
00:10:09,436 --> 00:10:11,236
It's something the noblest individuals
would never do.

217
00:10:11,582 --> 00:10:13,983
These are probably the basic virtues
that a doctor should possess.

218
00:10:14,063 --> 00:10:14,942
Explain it.

219
00:10:15,022 --> 00:10:15,823
Go ahead.

220
00:10:17,063 --> 00:10:17,863
It means that

221
00:10:18,063 --> 00:10:20,303
if someone in a house
is suffering from pain,

222
00:10:20,502 --> 00:10:22,782
then everyone in the house
will be unhappy.

223
00:10:22,863 --> 00:10:25,183
This pain will continue
to accompany the patient.

224
00:10:25,462 --> 00:10:27,383
Especially for a doctor like you,

225
00:10:28,183 --> 00:10:30,382
who at this time is selfishly
worrying about his own stomach

226
00:10:30,462 --> 00:10:31,303
and happiness,

227
00:10:31,383 --> 00:10:33,743
this is absolutely something that
angers both humans and gods.

228
00:10:33,823 --> 00:10:34,902
You get what I mean?

229
00:10:47,623 --> 00:10:48,576
What's wrong, Tou Tou?

230
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:53,182
Come. Let me read your pulse.

231
00:11:04,383 --> 00:11:05,183
Ling Lan,

232
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,146
did you bring
brown sugar and ginger?

233
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:09,670
Yes.

234
00:11:13,183 --> 00:11:14,743
Your feet are cold.

235
00:11:16,503 --> 00:11:19,920
You shouldn't expose your feet
during your menstruation period.

236
00:11:20,582 --> 00:11:21,502
Listen,

237
00:11:21,582 --> 00:11:22,702
starting today,

238
00:11:23,503 --> 00:11:26,183
you have to wear socks
to bed every night.

239
00:11:27,462 --> 00:11:28,942
After you go back this time, you have

240
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,263
to drink menstrual pain
reliever soup for two weeks.

241
00:11:32,623 --> 00:11:33,462
Tou,

242
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,988
I left you a bowl of chicken soup.

243
00:11:36,223 --> 00:11:37,402
It's still warm.

244
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:39,630
If you don't want it,
I will finish it.

245
00:11:41,263 --> 00:11:42,502
I want it.

246
00:11:42,582 --> 00:11:44,663
Leave it there.
I will go and drink it later.

247
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,120
I can't keep this.

248
00:11:46,823 --> 00:11:47,702
Peng Shi Yan,

249
00:11:48,063 --> 00:11:49,389
this behavior is considered
disgraceful by both humans and gods.

250
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:50,662
It's something the noblest individuals
would never do.

251
00:11:54,582 --> 00:11:55,796
He's drinking my chicken soup.

252
00:11:57,702 --> 00:11:58,743
Just stay here.

253
00:11:58,823 --> 00:12:01,023
But he's drinking my chicken soup.
There is no food left for me.

254
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,942
-I've saved you lunch.
-I saved you...

255
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:04,382
-Chicken soup?
-Brown sugar water.

256
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:05,423
Okay.

257
00:12:05,623 --> 00:12:08,183
Finish this.

258
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,560
Tou Tou,

259
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:12,062
finish this ginger water first.

260
00:12:12,242 --> 00:12:13,283
I will perform acupuncture on you later.

261
00:12:14,183 --> 00:12:15,623
Tian Zhen, bring me my needle bag.

262
00:12:16,142 --> 00:12:16,942
Okay.

263
00:12:27,702 --> 00:12:29,182
I was just about to bring it to you.

264
00:12:29,303 --> 00:12:30,956
-Thank you.
-Have some warm soup.

265
00:12:31,676 --> 00:12:32,823
Let me warm my hands first.

266
00:12:34,383 --> 00:12:35,263
The girl

267
00:12:35,503 --> 00:12:36,543
is really smart.

268
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,560
Despite not having studied
for many years,

269
00:12:38,823 --> 00:12:40,902
she has a good memory.

270
00:12:41,303 --> 00:12:42,983
Just now, she blurted out,

271
00:12:43,503 --> 00:12:44,736
"This behavior is considered
disgraceful by both humans and gods.

272
00:12:44,817 --> 00:12:46,383
It's something the noblest individuals
would never do."

273
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:51,083
Throughout our lives,

274
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,800
we go through two stages,

275
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,863
a sense of existence

276
00:12:53,943 --> 00:12:55,303
and a sense of belonging.

277
00:12:55,877 --> 00:12:56,917
This girl

278
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:58,443
lacks a sense of belonging,

279
00:12:58,943 --> 00:13:00,983
so she desperately tries
to gain attention,

280
00:13:01,063 --> 00:13:03,343
seeking to feel something.

281
00:13:03,463 --> 00:13:05,622
Actually, being aggressive
or fierce is not her character.

282
00:13:06,183 --> 00:13:06,983
That's right.

283
00:13:09,303 --> 00:13:10,623
I hope we can help her

284
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,079
find a sense of belonging.

285
00:13:15,142 --> 00:13:16,183
Hurry, hurry.

286
00:13:16,263 --> 00:13:17,063
Have some warm soup.

287
00:13:17,942 --> 00:13:19,942
You should leave the mountain
with the car later,

288
00:13:20,303 --> 00:13:21,542
and head home to rest.

289
00:13:22,702 --> 00:13:24,303
-Have some.
-No.

290
00:13:27,263 --> 00:13:28,743
-Then...
-No, no.

291
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:33,329
The weather in this mountain
changes three times a day.

292
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,203
I don't want you to catch a cold.

293
00:13:36,022 --> 00:13:37,062
Don't worry about me.

294
00:13:37,142 --> 00:13:39,263
You must get your cold treated.

295
00:13:39,823 --> 00:13:40,983
It's not uncommon for a cold

296
00:13:41,063 --> 00:13:42,156
to worsen to pneumonia.

297
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,599
I know.

298
00:13:43,755 --> 00:13:45,475
Take care of yourself
and get some rest when you get home.

299
00:13:56,063 --> 00:13:58,183
Students, you've got your schedules.

300
00:13:59,943 --> 00:14:00,823
Starting today,

301
00:14:02,902 --> 00:14:04,943
we will begin

302
00:14:05,582 --> 00:14:06,623
a one-week retreat course.

303
00:14:08,183 --> 00:14:09,103
Prior to this,

304
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:11,582
we have studied some theories

305
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:15,321
and practical techniques of acupuncture

306
00:14:15,943 --> 00:14:17,183
in TCM.

307
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,639
From today onward,

308
00:14:20,623 --> 00:14:23,183
we will begin to recite the classics

309
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,183
and establish a connection

310
00:14:25,263 --> 00:14:27,303
with the esteemed ancestors and sages.

311
00:14:27,823 --> 00:14:31,063
Let us cultivate
the habit of diligent study.

312
00:14:32,463 --> 00:14:33,383
As you know,

313
00:14:34,142 --> 00:14:36,943
the three months of spring are known as
the season of revival and rejuvenation.

314
00:14:37,303 --> 00:14:39,543
Nature is full of vitality.
All things appear vibrant and thriving.

315
00:14:39,623 --> 00:14:42,943
People sleep early and rise early.
They take walks in the courtyard.

316
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:47,702
They loosen their hair and relax
their bodies to invigorate the spirit.

317
00:14:48,556 --> 00:14:49,356
March

318
00:14:49,702 --> 00:14:51,423
is the season
when life begins to sprout.

319
00:14:51,943 --> 00:14:52,863
We should take advantage

320
00:14:52,943 --> 00:14:55,022
of this period of rejuvenation

321
00:14:55,823 --> 00:14:58,743
and align ourselves with
the growth of Yang energy.

322
00:14:59,582 --> 00:15:00,383
Therefore,

323
00:15:01,063 --> 00:15:02,263
it is important for everyone

324
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,623
to sleep early and rise early.

325
00:15:07,649 --> 00:15:08,449
Mr. Ren,

326
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,159
what hour is considered early
to go to bed and get up?

327
00:15:11,623 --> 00:15:13,222
Is there a standard time?

328
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,880
Ancient people paid great attention
to the division of time.

329
00:15:16,943 --> 00:15:19,729
In the Chinese zodiac, the hour of
"Hai" corresponds to the Pig sign,

330
00:15:19,823 --> 00:15:22,382
specifically from 9pm to 11pm.

331
00:15:22,469 --> 00:15:23,582
During this time period,

332
00:15:24,383 --> 00:15:26,743
pigs sleep most soundly.

333
00:15:26,823 --> 00:15:28,582
I sleep most soundly at the time.

334
00:15:30,383 --> 00:15:31,743
If you haven't gone

335
00:15:32,462 --> 00:15:33,622
to bed in this hour,

336
00:15:33,702 --> 00:15:34,662
then it won't be ideal.

337
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,241
I understand that

338
00:15:36,503 --> 00:15:39,702
asking you to go to bed
at nine o'clock is a little difficult.

339
00:15:40,343 --> 00:15:41,143
Therefore,

340
00:15:41,323 --> 00:15:45,382
let's set a rule that
you should not sleep later than 11pm.

341
00:15:45,582 --> 00:15:46,503
However, remember that

342
00:15:47,623 --> 00:15:48,902
you must wake up

343
00:15:49,142 --> 00:15:50,423
at 5am.

344
00:15:51,623 --> 00:15:54,383
It's time to start studying
and cultivating.

345
00:15:54,743 --> 00:15:56,462
But according to meteorology,

346
00:15:56,542 --> 00:15:57,423
it is said that

347
00:15:57,503 --> 00:15:59,262
to enter spring, the average
temperature must be equal to

348
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,862
or greater than ten degrees Celsius
for five consecutive days.

349
00:16:00,943 --> 00:16:02,223
The temperature in this mountain

350
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:04,062
has definitely not reached spring yet.

351
00:16:04,142 --> 00:16:06,142
Moreover, with such heavy cold
in the morning,

352
00:16:06,222 --> 00:16:08,503
wouldn't it be worse for our health?

353
00:16:09,063 --> 00:16:13,022
Remember, the change of seasons is
not solely determined by temperature.

354
00:16:13,102 --> 00:16:14,383
For example,

355
00:16:14,743 --> 00:16:16,383
this student is a bit slender.

356
00:16:17,263 --> 00:16:19,502
If she puts on multiple layers
of clothing,

357
00:16:19,623 --> 00:16:21,983
she may look very fat,

358
00:16:22,063 --> 00:16:24,063
but the truth is
she is still slender inside.

359
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,600
As you know,

360
00:16:27,383 --> 00:16:30,383
spring has occasional cold snaps,

361
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,543
sometimes even colder than winter.

362
00:16:32,623 --> 00:16:34,863
However, it is still considered spring.

363
00:16:35,142 --> 00:16:36,183
The air is different.

364
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:38,863
I got it.

365
00:16:39,263 --> 00:16:40,863
You can't see it nor touch it.

366
00:16:40,943 --> 00:16:42,469
How do you know if it's here or not?

367
00:16:43,383 --> 00:16:44,183
Pardon me?

368
00:16:45,383 --> 00:16:46,183
The air?

369
00:16:47,503 --> 00:16:49,462
Can you see or touch oxygen?

370
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,409
But you still breathe, don't you?

371
00:16:54,142 --> 00:16:55,943
Students, today,

372
00:16:56,943 --> 00:16:58,062
we are going to start reading

373
00:16:58,356 --> 00:16:59,719
Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic:

374
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,516
Questions of Organic and
Fundamental Nature,

375
00:17:01,702 --> 00:17:03,183
specifically the section

376
00:17:03,263 --> 00:17:05,702
on the Spirit Regulation
in Four Seasons.

377
00:17:06,876 --> 00:17:08,503
After everyone has finished
reading this section,

378
00:17:08,662 --> 00:17:12,022
you will have a
better understanding of the air.

379
00:17:13,183 --> 00:17:14,743
Nights come very early

380
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:16,370
in the mountains.

381
00:17:16,662 --> 00:17:17,702
Remember, you should adhere

382
00:17:17,735 --> 00:17:20,296
to a routine of sleeping early
and rising early.

383
00:17:20,863 --> 00:17:22,343
Also, starting today,

384
00:17:22,716 --> 00:17:24,762
we will enter into
a secluded training programme.

385
00:17:25,022 --> 00:17:25,902
Class Leader,

386
00:17:26,496 --> 00:17:28,415
you will confiscate

387
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,840
everyone's phone later.

388
00:17:32,782 --> 00:17:34,743
-Hang on...
-From today onward,

389
00:17:34,869 --> 00:17:35,949
I hope that you all

390
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:38,550
will be completely undistracted.

391
00:17:39,542 --> 00:17:41,263
Can you not take away our phones?

392
00:17:41,782 --> 00:17:42,582
No.

393
00:17:43,142 --> 00:17:44,942
Why do you want to take away our phones?

394
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,960
All right, Class Leader.

395
00:17:46,022 --> 00:17:47,462
Lead everyone to begin reciting

396
00:17:47,542 --> 00:17:49,063
the Virtue of A Great Physician.

397
00:17:49,702 --> 00:17:51,281
Spirit Regulation in Four Seasons.

398
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,863
Spirit Regulation in Four Seasons.

399
00:17:54,142 --> 00:17:54,942
Second.

400
00:17:55,142 --> 00:17:56,462
The three months of spring

401
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:58,582
are known as the season
of revival and rejuvenation.

402
00:17:58,623 --> 00:18:01,743
Nature is full of vitality.
All things appear vibrant and thriving.

403
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:05,410
People sleep early and rise early.
They take walks in the courtyard.

404
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:08,903
They loosen their hair and relax
their bodies to invigorate the spirit.

405
00:18:08,983 --> 00:18:12,223
Do not kill the living,
give instead of taking.

406
00:18:12,303 --> 00:18:15,702
Reward instead of punishment.
This is the harmony of spring Qi.

407
00:18:15,782 --> 00:18:17,622
It is the way of nurturing life,

408
00:18:17,702 --> 00:18:19,622
going against it will harm the liver.

409
00:18:19,702 --> 00:18:21,335
When cold occurs in summer,

410
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,286
there is little
to support growth of life.

411
00:18:27,063 --> 00:18:27,863
Come.

412
00:18:56,822 --> 00:18:57,622
Mr. Ren,

413
00:18:58,023 --> 00:18:59,183
all phones are collected.

414
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
(Qibo Medical Center)

415
00:19:06,422 --> 00:19:07,222
Dr. Song.

416
00:19:07,543 --> 00:19:09,102
-Morning.
-Dr. Song,

417
00:19:09,182 --> 00:19:11,903
there is a mother and daughter there
who insist to see Professor Ren.

418
00:19:12,543 --> 00:19:13,982
They've been here
even before you left.

419
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,582
They've been waiting for three days.

420
00:19:16,783 --> 00:19:17,943
Didn't you tell them

421
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:19,423
we were going to Mount Huafeng?

422
00:19:19,503 --> 00:19:20,463
I did. They won't listen.

423
00:19:20,543 --> 00:19:22,823
They insist on waiting here
until they see Professor Ren.

424
00:19:24,302 --> 00:19:25,302
All right. I got it.

425
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:37,742
Excuse me.

426
00:19:37,995 --> 00:19:39,836
Are you here to see Professor Ren?

427
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,200
We heard that

428
00:19:43,276 --> 00:19:45,356
Professor Ren's acupuncture technique
is very good.

429
00:19:45,543 --> 00:19:47,102
So, I brought my girl here to see him.

430
00:19:48,903 --> 00:19:50,182
You came at a bad timing.

431
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:52,342
He took his students to Mount Huafeng.

432
00:19:52,489 --> 00:19:55,129
He will take at least a week to return.

433
00:19:56,143 --> 00:19:56,943
I'm his wife.

434
00:19:57,023 --> 00:19:58,422
I'm a doctor too.

435
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,360
Will you let me

436
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:03,263
examine the girl first?

437
00:20:03,963 --> 00:20:05,343
(Zhu Xia)

438
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,793
(Ding Jian Xi)

439
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:31,221
(Qibo Medical Center)

440
00:21:31,302 --> 00:21:32,903
It was my birthday.

441
00:21:33,302 --> 00:21:34,663
She sneaked out

442
00:21:35,623 --> 00:21:37,143
to buy me a cake.

443
00:21:37,422 --> 00:21:38,942
She wanted to surprise me.

444
00:21:40,702 --> 00:21:42,062
She was waiting

445
00:21:42,543 --> 00:21:43,942
at a red light by herself.

446
00:21:45,942 --> 00:21:47,422
A terrible accident occurred.

447
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:49,702
A fast driving car

448
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:51,663
hit my daughter.

449
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,720
Dr. Song,

450
00:21:59,543 --> 00:22:00,543
why do I have to

451
00:22:01,023 --> 00:22:02,422
suffer such a miserable fate?

452
00:22:02,903 --> 00:22:05,062
Her father died early.

453
00:22:06,143 --> 00:22:08,143
I brought her up alone as a widow.

454
00:22:08,663 --> 00:22:10,383
I was afraid that she would be wronged,

455
00:22:11,062 --> 00:22:12,155
so I didn't get remarried.

456
00:22:12,543 --> 00:22:13,942
No one could talk me into it.

457
00:22:16,182 --> 00:22:18,903
I thought my life was finally
getting better.

458
00:22:20,663 --> 00:22:21,623
I don't know

459
00:22:22,302 --> 00:22:23,503
how many bad things

460
00:22:23,903 --> 00:22:25,583
I had done in my past life.

461
00:22:25,663 --> 00:22:27,383
Why is God punishing me like this?

462
00:22:28,143 --> 00:22:31,182
If He wants to punish me,
he should have let the car hit me.

463
00:22:32,023 --> 00:22:32,823
He...

464
00:22:34,143 --> 00:22:36,463
Jian Xi is only 22 years old.

465
00:22:36,543 --> 00:22:38,783
Her good days had not yet begun.

466
00:22:41,182 --> 00:22:42,102
This is all my fault.

467
00:22:42,182 --> 00:22:44,462
Why did I let her go out that day?

468
00:22:47,023 --> 00:22:47,823
Zhu Xia,

469
00:22:49,062 --> 00:22:49,983
don't think like that.

470
00:22:54,596 --> 00:22:55,436
I

471
00:22:56,143 --> 00:22:58,302
have a son.

472
00:22:59,302 --> 00:23:01,422
He's about the same age as Jian Xi.

473
00:23:03,023 --> 00:23:04,982
I don't think he even remembers

474
00:23:05,062 --> 00:23:06,055
what day my birthday is,

475
00:23:06,182 --> 00:23:08,342
let alone buying me a birthday present.

476
00:23:09,903 --> 00:23:10,703
You see,

477
00:23:11,383 --> 00:23:13,663
Jian Xi is such a good girl,

478
00:23:14,543 --> 00:23:15,663
such a good daughter.

479
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,630
This is your blessing.

480
00:23:18,182 --> 00:23:18,982
Yes.

481
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,081
Natural and man-made disasters

482
00:23:22,903 --> 00:23:24,783
are beyond our control,

483
00:23:25,543 --> 00:23:26,343
right?

484
00:23:26,903 --> 00:23:29,543
You must not take

485
00:23:30,182 --> 00:23:31,743
all this guilt upon yourself.

486
00:23:33,143 --> 00:23:34,422
Stay strong.

487
00:23:36,122 --> 00:23:37,242
You have to remember that

488
00:23:38,182 --> 00:23:41,263
you are Jian Xi's reliance and hope.

489
00:23:45,623 --> 00:23:46,823
I've shown her X-ray film

490
00:23:46,903 --> 00:23:49,222
to all renowned doctors
in Beijing, Shanghai,

491
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:50,702
Guangzhou, and Shenzhen.

492
00:23:50,822 --> 00:23:52,422
They've tried everything.

493
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,880
Nothing worked.

494
00:23:55,302 --> 00:23:57,242
She might stay this way
for the rest of her life.

495
00:23:58,182 --> 00:23:59,942
I'm worried about

496
00:24:01,062 --> 00:24:03,943
how she can take care of herself
if I get sick one day.

497
00:24:04,023 --> 00:24:04,823
I mean,

498
00:24:05,263 --> 00:24:07,182
what if I die one day?

499
00:24:07,903 --> 00:24:09,503
Then, Jian Xi will be...

500
00:24:11,182 --> 00:24:12,309
I don't dare to imagine it.

501
00:24:12,543 --> 00:24:13,663
Zhu Xia. Zhu Xia,

502
00:24:15,023 --> 00:24:15,942
I hope

503
00:24:16,942 --> 00:24:18,903
you won't have such thoughts
from now on.

504
00:24:20,142 --> 00:24:21,062
I promise you,

505
00:24:21,143 --> 00:24:22,783
we will do everything we can,

506
00:24:23,062 --> 00:24:25,903
but you have to have faith too.

507
00:24:26,182 --> 00:24:26,982
I have faith.

508
00:24:27,023 --> 00:24:28,143
You have to brave.

509
00:27:02,623 --> 00:27:03,423
Where is Tou Tou?

510
00:27:03,783 --> 00:27:05,743
She was still sleeping
when I left the room.

511
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,320
Still sleeping?

512
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:09,880
Class Leader.

513
00:27:11,822 --> 00:27:13,303
Li Quan, go and wake Tou Tou up.

514
00:27:19,263 --> 00:27:20,063
Take this with you.

515
00:27:20,663 --> 00:27:21,823
If she won't get up,

516
00:27:21,903 --> 00:27:22,703
whip her.

517
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:24,920
Yes, sir.

518
00:27:37,263 --> 00:27:38,063
Tou.

519
00:27:39,383 --> 00:27:40,903
Get up to study now.

520
00:27:41,215 --> 00:27:42,015
Wake up.

521
00:27:42,343 --> 00:27:43,983
-Hurry.
-Tou Tou, get up.

522
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,242
Mr. Ren is calling for you.

523
00:27:46,702 --> 00:27:47,543
Get up.

524
00:27:52,023 --> 00:27:53,943
Fine. This is Master's order.

525
00:27:54,023 --> 00:27:55,022
I'm going to hit you

526
00:27:55,102 --> 00:27:56,143
if you don't get up now.

527
00:27:58,023 --> 00:27:58,823
All right.

528
00:27:59,028 --> 00:28:01,989
Three, two, one.

529
00:28:04,822 --> 00:28:06,263
I want to get out of here!

530
00:28:15,543 --> 00:28:16,343
Xin Zheng,

531
00:28:16,663 --> 00:28:18,943
you really have great patience.

532
00:28:19,023 --> 00:28:20,182
It's been a couple of days.

533
00:28:20,543 --> 00:28:21,943
Why did you finally remember to

534
00:28:22,023 --> 00:28:23,102
go see Little Lark today?

535
00:28:23,383 --> 00:28:24,503
I almost thought

536
00:28:24,663 --> 00:28:25,582
you were giving up.

537
00:28:26,263 --> 00:28:28,142
We're here for closed-door training,

538
00:28:28,222 --> 00:28:30,182
not catching up with an old friend.

539
00:28:30,422 --> 00:28:31,222
Save it.

540
00:28:31,302 --> 00:28:32,982
So why do you have time
to call me here today?

541
00:28:33,023 --> 00:28:34,702
We're leaving in two days.

542
00:28:34,903 --> 00:28:36,623
What should be done must be done.

543
00:28:41,702 --> 00:28:42,623
Xin Zheng,

544
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:45,850
we are going to knock on
the door of your old crush.

545
00:28:46,422 --> 00:28:49,703
If the one who opens the door
is your old crush,

546
00:28:49,783 --> 00:28:52,102
this will be a timeless tale then.

547
00:28:57,702 --> 00:28:59,102
She is a hermit,

548
00:29:00,503 --> 00:29:03,422
who has transcended
the boundaries of gender.

549
00:29:17,663 --> 00:29:18,623
Please come in.

550
00:29:25,996 --> 00:29:28,317
We were looking for an old friend.

551
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,549
Thank you for your time.

552
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,341
I might not be the one
you're looking for,

553
00:29:33,422 --> 00:29:35,943
but you are the one I'm looking for.

554
00:29:36,023 --> 00:29:36,983
I know you.

555
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:55,943
Tou Tou is so obedient today.

556
00:29:56,023 --> 00:29:57,102
She went to bed so early.

557
00:29:57,182 --> 00:29:57,982
I know, right?

558
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,799
She snores so loudly.

559
00:30:00,143 --> 00:30:02,156
Who will share a bed
with her in the future?

560
00:30:02,663 --> 00:30:03,663
Us.

561
00:30:23,702 --> 00:30:24,903
Why are you still awake?

562
00:30:27,062 --> 00:30:30,182
I can't sleep
without Tou Tou snoring now.

563
00:30:38,623 --> 00:30:39,503
Tou Tou,

564
00:30:40,062 --> 00:30:41,748
Don't cover your head with the blanket.

565
00:30:45,062 --> 00:30:46,743
Get up. Tou Tou is gone.

566
00:30:47,422 --> 00:30:48,382
Get up now.

567
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,560
Tou Tou is gone.

568
00:31:00,503 --> 00:31:01,303
Every day,

569
00:31:03,023 --> 00:31:05,549
I get up earlier than a rooster
and eat less than a rooster.

570
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,462
What will be left of me

571
00:31:07,543 --> 00:31:08,822
by the time we can go back?

572
00:31:09,503 --> 00:31:10,496
They want me to learn

573
00:31:10,903 --> 00:31:11,863
and write calligraphy.

574
00:31:12,302 --> 00:31:13,102
Look at me.

575
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,640
Do I look like someone

576
00:31:14,716 --> 00:31:16,383
who studies and writes calligraphy?

577
00:31:16,702 --> 00:31:18,622
I want to eat and drink.

578
00:31:18,702 --> 00:31:19,903
Once I get out of here,

579
00:31:20,383 --> 00:31:21,422
I'll eat and drink

580
00:31:21,942 --> 00:31:22,783
as much as I want.

581
00:31:23,422 --> 00:31:24,535
I will play with my phone.

582
00:31:24,663 --> 00:31:25,783
I will play all night long.

583
00:31:26,023 --> 00:31:27,543
I will stay up all night.

584
00:31:27,623 --> 00:31:28,423
Yes.

585
00:31:28,663 --> 00:31:30,182
Why should I cultivate everyday?

586
00:31:31,023 --> 00:31:32,222
I'm such a smart girl.

587
00:31:32,903 --> 00:31:33,703
I'll just...

588
00:31:33,942 --> 00:31:35,703
I... I'll just...

589
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,479
I'll just eat and drink whatever I want.

590
00:31:41,956 --> 00:31:43,122
You can't control me now!

591
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,919
I'm free!

592
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,279
There is another slope.

593
00:32:23,062 --> 00:32:24,802
Why do I feel like
I've been here before?

594
00:32:29,543 --> 00:32:30,542
I will set this up here.

595
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,720
Where is the red string?

596
00:32:45,623 --> 00:32:47,423
How come I don't see
any of the red strings

597
00:32:47,783 --> 00:32:48,942
tied by Ling Lan?

598
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,000
Why am I walking on another slope?

599
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:53,903
How... How...

600
00:32:54,756 --> 00:32:55,556
How is this...

601
00:32:59,636 --> 00:33:00,876
I set this up, didn't I?

602
00:33:01,663 --> 00:33:03,783
This is simply a maze!

603
00:33:04,702 --> 00:33:06,263
Is there anyone?

604
00:33:06,863 --> 00:33:07,703
What should I do?

605
00:33:09,783 --> 00:33:11,023
I give up. I...

606
00:33:11,783 --> 00:33:13,142
I give up!

607
00:33:13,222 --> 00:33:14,422
I'm so unlucky!

608
00:33:14,543 --> 00:33:15,343
Unlucky!

609
00:33:16,263 --> 00:33:17,182
Unlucky!

610
00:33:17,302 --> 00:33:18,302
Unlucky!

611
00:33:18,903 --> 00:33:19,703
Unlucky!

612
00:33:24,762 --> 00:33:25,562
What should I do?

613
00:33:29,942 --> 00:33:31,335
I'll wait until the sun comes up.

614
00:33:31,903 --> 00:33:32,703
Wait until sunrise.

615
00:33:33,783 --> 00:33:34,776
I can't get out of here.

616
00:33:56,903 --> 00:33:57,703
I'm exhausted.

617
00:34:36,143 --> 00:34:37,302
Where do the bees come from?

618
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,280
No! No!

619
00:34:41,743 --> 00:34:43,582
Get away from me!

620
00:34:43,822 --> 00:34:45,302
Get away!

621
00:34:45,903 --> 00:34:46,703
Back off!

622
00:34:46,743 --> 00:34:48,503
Back off! Back off!

623
00:34:49,743 --> 00:34:50,543
Help!

624
00:34:52,696 --> 00:34:53,543
Help!

625
00:34:53,983 --> 00:34:54,783
Help!

626
00:34:55,462 --> 00:34:56,743
Help! Help!

627
00:35:01,942 --> 00:35:02,742
Tou Tou?

628
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:05,102
Somebody!

629
00:35:05,462 --> 00:35:06,622
-I'm here.
-What's wrong?

630
00:35:06,702 --> 00:35:08,342
I'm here. I'm here.

631
00:35:08,422 --> 00:35:09,663
There are hornets.

632
00:35:09,743 --> 00:35:10,663
There are hornets.

633
00:35:10,743 --> 00:35:11,543
-Calm down.
-Let me handle it.

634
00:35:11,623 --> 00:35:12,423
Don't be afraid.

635
00:35:13,543 --> 00:35:14,343
Spray them.

636
00:35:17,983 --> 00:35:19,622
-Are you done?
-Yes, yes.

637
00:35:19,983 --> 00:35:21,022
It's okay now. It's okay.

638
00:35:23,543 --> 00:35:25,062
Come, Tou Tou.

639
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,440
Tou Tou, are you okay?

640
00:35:27,143 --> 00:35:27,983
I'm fine, I'm fine.

641
00:35:28,623 --> 00:35:30,036
-I'm fine, I'm fine.
-It's okay now.

642
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,000
It's okay now.

643
00:35:31,263 --> 00:35:32,143
The hornets are gone.

644
00:35:32,983 --> 00:35:34,183
-Are you okay?
-Let me see.

645
00:35:37,143 --> 00:35:38,036
Your face are swollen.

646
00:35:41,428 --> 00:35:42,709
Why are you laughing?

647
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,040
How can you laugh?

648
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:47,983
A great physician
must be calm in spirit,

649
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:48,943
free from desires.

650
00:35:49,023 --> 00:35:51,702
He must first have a compassionate heart

651
00:35:51,976 --> 00:35:53,176
and be committed to relieving
the sufferings of all people.

652
00:35:53,263 --> 00:35:54,423
Relieving the sufferings of all people.

653
00:35:54,503 --> 00:35:55,809
How can you laugh?

654
00:35:56,382 --> 00:35:57,902
You can never be a great physician!

655
00:35:58,182 --> 00:35:59,783
You've become so articulate now.

656
00:36:00,382 --> 00:36:01,182
Master.

657
00:36:01,303 --> 00:36:02,142
I'm here, Tou Tou.

658
00:36:02,222 --> 00:36:03,102
Where?

659
00:36:03,182 --> 00:36:03,982
This side.

660
00:36:05,622 --> 00:36:07,743
You were going to leave, weren't you?

661
00:36:08,662 --> 00:36:09,462
All right.

662
00:36:10,462 --> 00:36:12,262
It's good that you are still alive.

663
00:36:13,503 --> 00:36:15,262
-You can leave now.
-No, no, Master!

664
00:36:15,743 --> 00:36:16,543
I'm staying.

665
00:36:16,783 --> 00:36:18,382
I'm staying. Really, I'm staying.

666
00:36:18,702 --> 00:36:20,182
I am very,

667
00:36:20,382 --> 00:36:21,503
very grateful that

668
00:36:21,702 --> 00:36:23,263
the four of you came to find me.

669
00:36:23,662 --> 00:36:24,503
Because today,

670
00:36:25,142 --> 00:36:25,942
I went from there

671
00:36:26,303 --> 00:36:27,103
to here...

672
00:36:28,662 --> 00:36:30,783
There are only two of us here.

673
00:36:33,662 --> 00:36:35,942
Oh, my God! This is killing me!

674
00:36:36,823 --> 00:36:38,182
I'm really...

675
00:36:38,461 --> 00:36:41,662
My head is buzzing now.

676
00:36:41,743 --> 00:36:43,302
And, I really...

677
00:36:43,382 --> 00:36:44,382
I'm really staying.

678
00:36:44,462 --> 00:36:46,382
I will practice calligraphy well,

679
00:36:46,462 --> 00:36:47,663
read well

680
00:36:47,743 --> 00:36:49,903
and cultivate well.

681
00:36:49,983 --> 00:36:51,743
-So, you are really staying?
-Yes!

682
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,961
I'm staying.

683
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,169
Will you doze off again
when you are studying?

684
00:36:56,503 --> 00:36:57,303
No.

685
00:36:57,702 --> 00:36:58,663
Will you doze off again
when you are cultivating?

686
00:36:58,743 --> 00:36:59,543
No.

687
00:36:59,702 --> 00:37:01,382
-Will you practice your calligraphy?
-Yes.

688
00:37:01,902 --> 00:37:04,062
If you do it again next time,
I won't come find you.

689
00:37:04,142 --> 00:37:05,743
There won't be a next time at all.

690
00:37:06,503 --> 00:37:07,303
Next time...

691
00:37:07,503 --> 00:37:08,783
-Next time...
-Let's go.

692
00:37:09,622 --> 00:37:11,903
I feel like I've been stung
on my tongue too.

693
00:37:11,983 --> 00:37:13,382
My tongue has been stung.

694
00:37:13,462 --> 00:37:16,103
-All right now, let's go.
-This is killing me.

695
00:37:17,222 --> 00:37:18,902
And my tongue.

696
00:37:20,023 --> 00:37:21,761
-Your tongue is going numb too?
-Yes.

697
00:37:23,182 --> 00:37:24,223
Look at this. Look.

698
00:37:24,316 --> 00:37:26,836
It's clearly marked as the right way,
and you didn't take it.

699
00:37:28,263 --> 00:37:29,063
Look.

700
00:37:29,702 --> 00:37:31,062
You chose the wrong way instead.

701
00:37:32,902 --> 00:37:33,983
-Come on.
-Okay.

702
00:37:34,123 --> 00:37:34,923
Wait.

703
00:37:35,263 --> 00:37:36,462
Stop looking. Just walk.

704
00:37:42,462 --> 00:37:43,263
Come on.

705
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,880
The hornets are here.

706
00:37:56,622 --> 00:37:57,422
What's wrong?

707
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,600
It's so cold.

708
00:38:03,743 --> 00:38:04,823
You reminded me.

709
00:38:05,662 --> 00:38:07,462
I should use something warmer.

710
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,833
Do any of you have pee?

711
00:38:15,182 --> 00:38:15,982
Pee?

712
00:38:16,462 --> 00:38:17,262
That's right.

713
00:38:17,382 --> 00:38:18,823
Go and pee. Bring it over.

714
00:38:19,303 --> 00:38:20,463
I make it into a paste.

715
00:38:20,543 --> 00:38:21,743
It's warmer that way.

716
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,240
Master,

717
00:38:31,422 --> 00:38:32,783
it's fine. It's not cold anymore.

718
00:38:33,543 --> 00:38:35,182
I'm feeling quite comfortable.

719
00:38:35,382 --> 00:38:36,182
No.

720
00:38:36,783 --> 00:38:37,822
You just reminded me.

721
00:38:37,902 --> 00:38:39,302
My master told me

722
00:38:39,382 --> 00:38:40,182
that urine

723
00:38:40,462 --> 00:38:42,142
is a good antidote to poison.

724
00:38:45,622 --> 00:38:46,422
Mr. Ren.

725
00:38:49,236 --> 00:38:50,543
Slow down, slow down.

726
00:38:51,823 --> 00:38:52,902
Don't get it on my hands.

727
00:38:54,622 --> 00:38:55,503
Master.

728
00:38:56,142 --> 00:38:57,623
-Yes?
-I...

729
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:00,343
Is it too late for me?

730
00:39:00,823 --> 00:39:01,702
No.

731
00:39:02,983 --> 00:39:04,182
It will be too late for you

732
00:39:04,462 --> 00:39:05,576
if you are feeling dizzy.

733
00:39:05,743 --> 00:39:07,662
I'm feeling dizzy now.

734
00:39:08,382 --> 00:39:10,382
Even if you're dizzy,
I can still cure you.

735
00:39:10,529 --> 00:39:12,410
As long as you are not short of breath,

736
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,081
I can cure you.

737
00:39:16,543 --> 00:39:18,182
I feel like I'm short of breath.

738
00:39:18,702 --> 00:39:19,902
I feel like

739
00:39:20,702 --> 00:39:21,502
I'm being...

740
00:39:22,263 --> 00:39:23,182
I'm being...

741
00:39:24,702 --> 00:39:26,622
Shush, shush.

742
00:39:27,743 --> 00:39:28,543
Dad,

743
00:39:29,655 --> 00:39:31,455
Tou Tou really passed out.

744
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,321
She's not passed out.

745
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,023
She is tired and frightened.

746
00:39:41,382 --> 00:39:42,182
She fell asleep.

747
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,719
She's really something.

748
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,160
We've been tirelessly
searching all night for her.

749
00:39:46,222 --> 00:39:47,902
Look at her. She fell asleep right away.

750
00:39:48,182 --> 00:39:49,023
That's right.

751
00:39:49,263 --> 00:39:50,263
Unbelievable.

752
00:39:51,462 --> 00:39:52,303
Students,

753
00:39:52,823 --> 00:39:56,103
our final lesson during seclusion
is to practice footwork.

754
00:39:56,902 --> 00:39:59,902
And you finished it tonight.

755
00:40:00,543 --> 00:40:02,662
We'll leave here early tomorrow morning.

756
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,320
Yes, Mr. Ren.

757
00:40:07,983 --> 00:40:08,783
Tian Zhen,

758
00:40:09,382 --> 00:40:10,663
apply the rest on her face.

759
00:40:10,743 --> 00:40:12,103
Okay, okay.

760
00:40:12,662 --> 00:40:14,303
-Be gentle.
-Okay.

761
00:40:22,622 --> 00:40:23,722
Don't remove the blanket.

762
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,120
Tian Zhen,

763
00:40:26,743 --> 00:40:27,543
will this work?

764
00:40:28,662 --> 00:40:29,462
Yes.

765
00:40:29,902 --> 00:40:31,343
-Trust my dad.
-Do...

766
00:40:31,503 --> 00:40:33,182
-Do you need more of this?
-No.

767
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,740
You really do come from a wealthy
and influential family, Prince Ren.

768
00:40:49,942 --> 00:40:51,702
I was too kind to you before.

769
00:40:52,222 --> 00:40:55,102
Quan, he will pay for our meals
from now on.

770
00:40:55,182 --> 00:40:55,983
Freeload off him.

771
00:40:56,462 --> 00:40:58,262
This is my grandpa's medical center,
not mine.

772
00:40:58,303 --> 00:40:59,622
Listen to yourself.

773
00:40:59,702 --> 00:41:01,888
-It will be yours one day, won't it?
-I don't need it.

774
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,600
Besides, there is no explicit rule

775
00:41:03,662 --> 00:41:05,462
stating that this must be
passed on to me.

776
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,080
Listen to him.

777
00:41:07,743 --> 00:41:09,102
Who else will it be passed on to
if not you?

778
00:41:09,182 --> 00:41:10,703
You just don't appreciate
what you have.

779
00:41:10,783 --> 00:41:11,583
I'm telling you,

780
00:41:11,702 --> 00:41:13,075
it's such a nice medical center.

781
00:41:13,622 --> 00:41:15,543
I'd be over the moon

782
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,120
if it could be passed on to me.

783
00:41:17,201 --> 00:41:18,320
You two are so weird.

784
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,280
What does my grandparents'
and my parents' stuff

785
00:41:20,337 --> 00:41:21,377
have to do with me?

786
00:41:21,662 --> 00:41:22,943
And it was not my choice

787
00:41:23,023 --> 00:41:24,542
to be their offspring.

788
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,720
You both talk as if I was blessed
with to have these advantages.

789
00:41:26,783 --> 00:41:27,583
Maybe you should try

790
00:41:27,702 --> 00:41:29,062
standing beneath
this ancestral legacy yourself.

791
00:41:29,142 --> 00:41:30,302
If you don't strive to grow,

792
00:41:30,382 --> 00:41:32,242
you won't even be able
to see the sun above.

793
00:41:34,182 --> 00:41:36,063
I got something to say.
Gather round, students.

794
00:41:36,622 --> 00:41:37,423
Class,

795
00:41:37,503 --> 00:41:38,583
gather round.

796
00:41:41,662 --> 00:41:43,350
-What's wrong, Tou Tou?
-My legs are numb.

797
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:44,920
You kneeled too long.

798
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:48,009
Class,

799
00:41:48,543 --> 00:41:51,422
practice is the sole criterion
for testing truth.

800
00:41:52,142 --> 00:41:54,142
Previously, we have basically concluded

801
00:41:54,222 --> 00:41:55,983
the lessons on TCM theory.

802
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,280
So, from now on, you will learn
and help out

803
00:41:58,343 --> 00:42:00,862
at the medical center on weekdays.

804
00:42:00,942 --> 00:42:03,743
We will continue with
the apprentice class on weekends.

805
00:42:05,983 --> 00:42:08,903
Am I going to do acupuncture
or prepare herbal medicine?

806
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,199
You are sweeping the floor.

807
00:42:13,743 --> 00:42:14,942
During this period,

808
00:42:15,142 --> 00:42:17,903
we will invite influential teachers

809
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:21,423
from different schools

810
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:23,463
and with different specialties

811
00:42:23,603 --> 00:42:24,703
to give you lectures.

812
00:42:24,783 --> 00:42:26,703
We hope that everyone of you

813
00:42:26,783 --> 00:42:28,943
can find out a field that you like

814
00:42:29,023 --> 00:42:30,983
and is most suitable for you

815
00:42:31,063 --> 00:42:33,583
during this learning period.

816
00:42:35,702 --> 00:42:36,702
You don't have a choice.

817
00:42:36,823 --> 00:42:38,142
You'll just have to follow me.

818
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:42,989
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

819
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:44,470
(are referenced from relevant
traditional Chinese medicine books)

820
00:42:44,557 --> 00:42:45,550
(Do not use without medical advice)
