(Qibo Medical Centre)

4
00:01:40,417 --> 00:01:42,056
He needs to accumulate
medical affinity.

5
00:01:42,056 --> 00:01:42,954
What is medical affinity?

6
00:01:43,456 --> 00:01:44,697
It means accumulating
merits and virtues.

7
00:01:45,817 --> 00:01:48,657
Through the provision of free
medical service for three to five years,

8
00:01:49,256 --> 00:01:50,857
patients will come to him voluntarily.

9
00:01:53,376 --> 00:01:54,417
I agree.

10
00:01:55,296 --> 00:01:56,141
Really.

11
00:01:56,343 --> 00:01:59,216
We should let them go to
the countryside to be barefoot doctors.

12
00:01:59,776 --> 00:02:01,856
When they face various
difficult and complicated cases,

13
00:02:02,056 --> 00:02:03,296
they will find solutions on their own.

14
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:05,776
This way, they will quickly
become skilled at their work.

15
00:02:07,936 --> 00:02:09,657
Do you still remember?

16
00:02:09,977 --> 00:02:10,817
In the past, we ignored everything else

17
00:02:10,817 --> 00:02:11,977
and travelled across

18
00:02:12,177 --> 00:02:14,977
hills and fields with
our medical toolbox.

19
00:02:15,136 --> 00:02:16,657
Am I right? And,

20
00:02:18,136 --> 00:02:19,697
we'd been living on the breadline.

21
00:02:20,377 --> 00:02:21,736
Do you remember? One time,

22
00:02:21,857 --> 00:02:23,177
we spent over two months
without taking a bath.

23
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:24,817
It was tough.

24
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,343
Am I right?

25
00:02:26,697 --> 00:02:28,057
Kids nowadays

26
00:02:28,697 --> 00:02:29,936
won't be able to experience

27
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:31,296
our hardships.

28
00:02:32,136 --> 00:02:33,377
Think about how many people

29
00:02:33,377 --> 00:02:34,776
we had saved back then.

30
00:02:36,217 --> 00:02:37,736
But none of them

31
00:02:38,017 --> 00:02:39,657
called me the Miracle Doctor.

32
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:51,816
You're always the Miracle Doctor
in my heart.

33
00:02:55,737 --> 00:02:56,777
I'll gladly accept it.

(Qibo Medical Centre)

35
00:03:05,496 --> 00:03:08,216
Mr Niu brought these
local specialities back for us.

36
00:03:08,417 --> 00:03:10,496
They're 100% natural
with no preservatives.

37
00:03:10,737 --> 00:03:13,097
I ate a lot of them when
I was living with them.

38
00:03:13,296 --> 00:03:14,657
-It tastes authentic.
-There's no preservative at all.

39
00:03:14,657 --> 00:03:15,446
Is that so?

40
00:03:15,536 --> 00:03:16,377
Here, try one.

41
00:03:16,417 --> 00:03:17,936
The dried sweet potato is really sweet.

42
00:03:18,536 --> 00:03:19,496
Wait, Ms Xia.

43
00:03:19,496 --> 00:03:20,616
You can let Jian Xi

44
00:03:20,616 --> 00:03:22,097
take more dried hawthorns.

45
00:03:24,856 --> 00:03:25,766
Roubecca,

46
00:03:26,097 --> 00:03:27,417
do you take dried sweet potato?

47
00:03:27,536 --> 00:03:28,777
It's crunchy and tasty.

48
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,000
What?

49
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:37,657
It's sweet.

50
00:03:38,737 --> 00:03:40,176
Thanks. Leave it over there first.

51
00:03:40,176 --> 00:03:40,993
I'll have it later.

52
00:03:42,536 --> 00:03:43,697
What are you doing?

53
00:03:45,096 --> 00:03:47,256
I'm deleting my junk emails.

54
00:03:48,456 --> 00:03:50,376
Deleting your junk emails? But why?

55
00:03:54,536 --> 00:03:56,816
Do you know what's an
environmental clock?

56
00:03:57,736 --> 00:03:59,736
Hong, do you mean
an environmental crisis clock?

57
00:04:00,456 --> 00:04:01,297
Tell us about it.

58
00:04:02,256 --> 00:04:04,297
You guys should've heard of
its other name before.

59
00:04:04,376 --> 00:04:05,937
It's called the Doomsday Clock.

60
00:04:07,656 --> 00:04:09,337
It was formed by

61
00:04:09,376 --> 00:04:11,176
over ten Nobel Prize winners

62
00:04:11,176 --> 00:04:12,376
in 1945.

63
00:04:13,096 --> 00:04:15,376
It will perform an overall assessment

64
00:04:15,376 --> 00:04:17,616
of various ecological environments

65
00:04:17,816 --> 00:04:19,656
of over 90 countries in the world.

66
00:04:19,736 --> 00:04:21,697
After that, it'll be published
every year

67
00:04:21,896 --> 00:04:23,736
to warn us of the harm

68
00:04:23,736 --> 00:04:25,697
our action is bringing to Earth.

69
00:04:26,297 --> 00:04:29,376
If the clock strikes midnight,

70
00:04:30,376 --> 00:04:32,176
it'll be the end of the world.

71
00:04:36,016 --> 00:04:37,896
Jian Xi is so knowledgeable.

72
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,210
What has this got to do
with deleting junk emails?

73
00:04:41,577 --> 00:04:43,016
Keeping your junk emails

74
00:04:43,297 --> 00:04:44,896
is akin to polluting the environment.

75
00:04:45,456 --> 00:04:47,497
Each of our emails is an account.

76
00:04:47,777 --> 00:04:48,777
The data of these accounts

77
00:04:48,816 --> 00:04:50,937
will be sent to countless base stations.

78
00:04:51,096 --> 00:04:52,577
The more data they accumulate,

79
00:04:52,816 --> 00:04:54,536
the more heat energy they generate.

80
00:04:54,937 --> 00:04:57,057
When we use our phones
or laptops for a long time,

81
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:59,016
they'll get hot.

82
00:04:59,176 --> 00:05:00,816
The temperature of the CPU
will increase.

83
00:05:00,816 --> 00:05:02,016
And, we need a radiator to cool it off.

84
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:04,417
For every GB of content,

85
00:05:04,456 --> 00:05:07,456
it consumes 32 kWh worth of electricity.

86
00:05:08,536 --> 00:05:10,937
There are 2.3 billion email users
in the world.

87
00:05:10,937 --> 00:05:12,577
If each of us can delete

88
00:05:12,577 --> 00:05:13,937
50 junk emails,

89
00:05:14,536 --> 00:05:16,016
we can save a total of

90
00:05:16,256 --> 00:05:19,536
8.625 million GBs worth of space.

91
00:05:19,536 --> 00:05:22,896
That means we'll be saving
over two trillion GBs worth of space.

92
00:05:23,536 --> 00:05:24,656
In other words,

93
00:05:24,816 --> 00:05:26,297
if we spend a few minutes

94
00:05:26,536 --> 00:05:28,096
and exercise our fingers here,

95
00:05:28,297 --> 00:05:30,096
we can save enough electricity

96
00:05:30,937 --> 00:05:33,016
to power 2.7 billion incandescent lamps

97
00:05:33,016 --> 00:05:34,536
for an hour.

98
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,000
It's that amazing?

99
00:05:36,016 --> 00:05:37,297
Xiao Hong, you're amazing.

100
00:05:38,176 --> 00:05:39,086
Look at me.

101
00:05:39,456 --> 00:05:40,360
I'm doing so

102
00:05:40,736 --> 00:05:42,456
for the sake of our future generations.

103
00:05:44,937 --> 00:05:45,797
How do I do it?

104
00:05:46,376 --> 00:05:48,217
-I'll teach you.
-We'll do it too.

105
00:05:48,656 --> 00:05:49,497
Which one should I press?

106
00:05:49,736 --> 00:05:50,736
-This one?
-Yeah.

107
00:05:50,736 --> 00:05:51,516
Press delete.

108
00:05:53,417 --> 00:05:55,096
I'll delete my junk emails

109
00:05:55,096 --> 00:05:56,457
when I get back.

110
00:06:26,137 --> 00:06:27,256
Hello, Tou Tou.

111
00:06:27,977 --> 00:06:30,017
(I don't know if I'll still be around)

112
00:06:30,697 --> 00:06:31,816
(by the time you watch this video.)

113
00:06:32,697 --> 00:06:34,256
(I have no way to save myself.)

114
00:06:35,256 --> 00:06:36,737
(I can only entrust my hope to you.)

115
00:06:37,816 --> 00:06:38,672
I'm sorry.

116
00:06:40,816 --> 00:06:41,977
I'm too weak.

117
00:06:43,977 --> 00:06:45,857
(But I still wish)

118
00:06:45,936 --> 00:06:47,560
(to give it one last try.)

119
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,601
(Tou Tou: Tian Zhen, come here!)

120
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,880
Did you miss me?

121
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:06,417
You scared me. You're finally here.

122
00:08:06,577 --> 00:08:07,461
Listen.

123
00:08:08,457 --> 00:08:09,383
Give me a kiss.

124
00:08:09,936 --> 00:08:11,737
Stop messing around.
I have something to tell you.

125
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,640
We can't kiss in the medical centre,
in the apprentice class,

126
00:08:13,697 --> 00:08:14,697
and everywhere else.

127
00:08:14,936 --> 00:08:15,936
Even now, we can't kiss each other?

128
00:08:16,256 --> 00:08:17,417
How are we dating each other then?

129
00:08:17,536 --> 00:08:18,422
Look.

130
00:08:18,857 --> 00:08:20,417
Look at this.

131
00:08:21,816 --> 00:08:22,857
What is it?

132
00:08:33,297 --> 00:08:34,417
Where did you find this?

133
00:08:35,737 --> 00:08:37,256
In my junk inbox.

134
00:08:39,096 --> 00:08:40,297
I only saw it today.

135
00:08:42,977 --> 00:08:45,496
There are too many secrets in my heart.

136
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:46,857
I can't tell anyone.

137
00:08:47,977 --> 00:08:49,656
I don't dare to tell
my parents about it.

138
00:08:49,977 --> 00:08:51,697
I cannot tell Tian Zhen too.

139
00:08:52,936 --> 00:08:53,737
I only dare

140
00:08:54,857 --> 00:08:55,977
(to tell you my secrets.)

141
00:08:58,816 --> 00:08:59,897
(I don't know how my life)

142
00:08:59,897 --> 00:09:01,936
(ended up like this.)

143
00:09:05,256 --> 00:09:06,297
Since young,

144
00:09:07,256 --> 00:09:10,577
famous celebrities, lecturers,
and artists who you could only see

145
00:09:10,857 --> 00:09:14,977
on magazines and TV shows

146
00:09:15,697 --> 00:09:17,256
were regular guests at our house.

147
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:19,177
I travelled all over the world

148
00:09:19,376 --> 00:09:21,160
together with Mum and Dad.

149
00:09:21,697 --> 00:09:23,457
I even own a pony.

150
00:09:25,096 --> 00:09:26,017
I thought

151
00:09:27,297 --> 00:09:28,496
I was happy.

152
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:33,500
Mum.

153
00:09:33,977 --> 00:09:35,056
-Morning.
-Have a seat.

154
00:09:35,697 --> 00:09:36,577
Come and have breakfast.

155
00:09:42,417 --> 00:09:43,243
Xu,

156
00:09:43,737 --> 00:09:44,656
I'm going on a business trip today.

157
00:09:45,177 --> 00:09:46,737
You can send Meng Meng to school.

158
00:09:46,737 --> 00:09:49,776
No, I have an appointment
with the publishing house today.

159
00:09:49,816 --> 00:09:50,704
I'm not free.

160
00:09:51,256 --> 00:09:52,417
I'll tell Guo to send her
to school then.

161
00:09:52,417 --> 00:09:53,656
-I can head there myself.
-Okay.

162
00:09:55,977 --> 00:09:57,256
Will you be having dinner
at home tonight?

163
00:09:57,417 --> 00:09:58,656
I'll be back after three days.

164
00:09:59,096 --> 00:10:01,256
Mum, I can take the school bus.

165
00:10:01,457 --> 00:10:02,776
That won't do.

166
00:10:02,816 --> 00:10:04,376
School buses stop at plenty of stops.

167
00:10:04,376 --> 00:10:05,256
It's a waste of time.

168
00:10:05,256 --> 00:10:06,056
I can do it myself.

169
00:10:07,617 --> 00:10:08,500
Meng Meng,

170
00:10:09,336 --> 00:10:11,136
why are you still wearing
your school uniform?

171
00:10:11,136 --> 00:10:12,497
Isn't today a casual day?

172
00:10:12,937 --> 00:10:14,937
I bought so many nice clothes for you.

173
00:10:14,937 --> 00:10:15,896
Go and change into them.

174
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,177
See you. I'll buy something nice
for you when I come back.

175
00:10:20,136 --> 00:10:21,057
Mum, goodbye.

176
00:10:24,576 --> 00:10:26,774
Meng Meng, I'm running late too.

177
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:28,456
I'll pick you up tonight.

178
00:10:28,456 --> 00:10:29,377
We'll have dinner with Mr Chen.

179
00:10:29,377 --> 00:10:30,235
Goodbye.

180
00:10:31,817 --> 00:10:32,737
Goodbye, Dad.

181
00:10:47,016 --> 00:10:47,899
Meng Meng,

182
00:10:48,016 --> 00:10:48,907
happy birthday.

183
00:10:49,456 --> 00:10:50,857
Longevity noodles are a must
during birthdays.

184
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:00,200
(Jiangzhou Jos International School)

185
00:11:02,216 --> 00:11:03,133
Wait for me.

186
00:11:03,776 --> 00:11:04,711
Hurry up.

187
00:11:17,456 --> 00:11:18,696
(But in reality,)

188
00:11:19,576 --> 00:11:21,456
(I was envious of my classmates)

189
00:11:21,696 --> 00:11:23,617
(who could do their homework
together in cafes.)

190
00:11:25,377 --> 00:11:28,136
(They could worship their
favourite idols during holidays.)

191
00:11:30,136 --> 00:11:31,417
After I got to know you,

192
00:11:31,696 --> 00:11:32,680
I was most envious of you.

193
00:11:33,696 --> 00:11:35,497
I wanted to be as free as you.

194
00:11:43,136 --> 00:11:44,000
(That's wrong.)

195
00:11:44,576 --> 00:11:45,896
(Dad and Mum treat me nicely.)

196
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:47,817
I'm already happy.

197
00:11:49,456 --> 00:11:51,576
I shouldn't be so greedy.

198
00:11:52,817 --> 00:11:54,937
(Although they're always by my side,)

199
00:11:55,216 --> 00:11:56,776
(they never know)

200
00:11:57,696 --> 00:12:00,297
(what I think and what I want.)

201
00:12:01,576 --> 00:12:02,656
Inside my heart,

202
00:12:05,216 --> 00:12:06,377
there's a beast.

203
00:12:08,377 --> 00:12:10,136
(I started to fear the night.)

204
00:12:11,456 --> 00:12:12,497
(I started to fear sleeping.)

205
00:12:13,257 --> 00:12:14,456
It's because that beast

206
00:12:15,136 --> 00:12:17,737
always comes out
in the middle of the night.

207
00:12:18,136 --> 00:12:19,656
It even appeared in my dream.

208
00:12:21,937 --> 00:12:24,016
(I felt like I was
losing control of it.)

209
00:12:24,696 --> 00:12:25,680
(I was afraid,)

210
00:12:26,136 --> 00:12:27,456
(but I couldn't hold it in.)

211
00:12:27,696 --> 00:12:29,977
(I didn't know what I should do.)

212
00:12:31,576 --> 00:12:32,656
(Tou Tou, do you know something?)

213
00:12:33,257 --> 00:12:35,336
(When my mother found out,)

214
00:12:36,136 --> 00:12:37,696
although I was very afraid,

215
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:40,257
I felt

216
00:12:40,896 --> 00:12:42,937
a sense of relief

217
00:12:42,937 --> 00:12:44,257
for some reason.

218
00:12:44,377 --> 00:12:45,617
It's like she finally found out.

219
00:12:48,576 --> 00:12:49,497
I thought

220
00:12:51,136 --> 00:12:52,857
she would teach me how to chase it away.

221
00:12:57,216 --> 00:12:58,336
What are you doing?

222
00:13:00,817 --> 00:13:01,817
(That was my first time)

223
00:13:01,817 --> 00:13:03,336
(seeing my mother getting enraged.)

224
00:13:04,336 --> 00:13:06,057
(She told me off and said
I was shameless.)

225
00:13:06,896 --> 00:13:09,937
(She made it as if
I was something indecent.)

226
00:13:10,896 --> 00:13:13,377
(I think Dad smoked a lot too
on that day.)

227
00:13:13,937 --> 00:13:16,377
(He was never this flustered even when)

228
00:13:16,696 --> 00:13:18,536
(he was the head of a national project.)

229
00:13:19,817 --> 00:13:20,977
(I was ashamed of myself.)

230
00:13:30,016 --> 00:13:31,096
I'm a sinner.

231
00:13:39,377 --> 00:13:41,336
(They said I must correct my ways.)

232
00:13:41,576 --> 00:13:42,497
I know that.

233
00:13:44,576 --> 00:13:45,817
I wish to become better.

234
00:13:46,497 --> 00:13:47,857
(I will become better.)

235
00:13:48,136 --> 00:13:49,336
(I can become better.)

236
00:13:50,257 --> 00:13:51,536
(I did put a lot of effort into it.)

237
00:13:53,696 --> 00:13:54,649
Meng Meng,

238
00:13:54,937 --> 00:13:56,817
we're doing this for your sake.

239
00:13:57,456 --> 00:13:58,817
We'll monitor you

240
00:13:58,817 --> 00:14:00,937
and help you to correct
your mistakes together, okay?

241
00:14:03,456 --> 00:14:04,407
Okay.

242
00:14:04,576 --> 00:14:05,555
All done.

243
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,821
There's no blind spot now.

244
00:14:16,016 --> 00:14:17,937
But it was too difficult.

245
00:14:18,576 --> 00:14:19,696
It was too difficult for me.

246
00:14:24,696 --> 00:14:25,576
Meng Meng,

247
00:14:25,576 --> 00:14:27,177
now, we can have peace of mind.

248
00:14:27,696 --> 00:14:29,136
Now that we have a camera here,

249
00:14:29,136 --> 00:14:30,617
your father and I can rush here

250
00:14:30,617 --> 00:14:32,096
immediately

251
00:14:32,136 --> 00:14:33,377
if anything happens.

252
00:14:34,336 --> 00:14:36,617
Sleep tight, okay?

253
00:14:38,456 --> 00:14:40,617
Meng Meng, take out your hands.

254
00:14:42,016 --> 00:14:42,860
Good girl.

255
00:14:48,136 --> 00:14:49,136
That's more like it.

256
00:14:49,497 --> 00:14:51,536
Alright, goodnight.

257
00:14:51,776 --> 00:14:52,937
Dad and Mum will watch over you.

258
00:14:53,937 --> 00:14:55,216
I'll go now. Goodnight.

259
00:15:19,096 --> 00:15:21,016
It's shameful to have parents like them.

260
00:15:23,016 --> 00:15:23,817
It's my fault too.

261
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:25,937
I never discovered her habit

262
00:15:25,937 --> 00:15:27,057
even though we lived together
for a long time.

263
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:30,817
Meng Meng's behaviour should expand
beyond the scope of normal puberty.

264
00:15:31,937 --> 00:15:33,377
She should be a sex addict.

265
00:15:37,776 --> 00:15:38,688
Sex addict?

266
00:15:41,057 --> 00:15:42,617
It's just like Internet addiction.

267
00:15:43,617 --> 00:15:44,485
Yes.

268
00:15:45,497 --> 00:15:46,857
She had obsessive needs

269
00:15:46,896 --> 00:15:48,456
toward intimate relationships and acts.

270
00:15:48,617 --> 00:15:49,817
It's a type of disorder.

271
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:52,696
Her parents shouldn't
jump to conclusions

272
00:15:52,696 --> 00:15:54,136
and think that it was an issue
with her lifestyle.

273
00:15:56,817 --> 00:15:57,937
With parents like them,

274
00:15:59,057 --> 00:16:00,497
even normal children
will get sick eventually.

275
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:02,456
For sex addicts,
there are psychological factors

276
00:16:02,456 --> 00:16:03,377
and pathological factors.

277
00:16:04,016 --> 00:16:05,617
My grandfather used to
have a patient like her.

278
00:16:06,497 --> 00:16:07,896
He had a tumour in his brain.

279
00:16:07,937 --> 00:16:09,257
It affected his pituitary gland.

280
00:16:09,536 --> 00:16:11,177
It's a shame that we have
no evidence now.

281
00:16:11,216 --> 00:16:12,377
I'm speechless.

282
00:16:12,377 --> 00:16:14,297
To think that her parents
are actually intellectuals.

283
00:16:14,817 --> 00:16:15,617
They didn't even know

284
00:16:15,617 --> 00:16:17,057
that their child was acting as such

285
00:16:17,057 --> 00:16:18,136
due to a disorder.

286
00:16:18,497 --> 00:16:19,776
They're only intellectuals
in certain fields.

287
00:16:19,817 --> 00:16:21,016
It's not like they're
good at everything.

288
00:16:21,776 --> 00:16:22,776
I would have no idea

289
00:16:22,776 --> 00:16:23,617
had I not encountered Meng Meng.

290
00:16:30,937 --> 00:16:32,016
You didn't realise it

291
00:16:32,297 --> 00:16:33,456
even when you spent so much time

292
00:16:33,817 --> 00:16:34,817
with Meng Meng?

293
00:16:45,016 --> 00:16:47,336
During a volunteer activity,

294
00:16:47,937 --> 00:16:49,377
I met Nan.

295
00:16:49,817 --> 00:16:52,377
He praised me for the puppy I drew.

296
00:16:53,377 --> 00:16:55,937
He said they could sell it
as a merchandise

297
00:16:56,696 --> 00:16:58,336
and help the rescue centre.

298
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:01,377
(He told me to make the puppy)

299
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:03,937
(look happier.)

300
00:17:05,456 --> 00:17:07,696
Hello. We're from the Care
and Compassion Society.

301
00:17:07,696 --> 00:17:09,057
We're holding this activity

302
00:17:09,057 --> 00:17:09,977
to help the animal shelters.

303
00:17:10,257 --> 00:17:11,136
Please take a look.

304
00:17:11,136 --> 00:17:11,937
Here you go.

305
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:13,289
Take a look.

306
00:17:14,136 --> 00:17:15,336
There's a QR code on it.

307
00:17:15,377 --> 00:17:17,057
You guys can scan it
and follow our page.

308
00:17:17,057 --> 00:17:17,914
Thank you.

309
00:17:19,136 --> 00:17:21,016
Hello. We're from the Care
and Compassion Society.

310
00:17:21,016 --> 00:17:23,377
We're holding this activity
to help the animal shelters.

311
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:24,817
There's a QR code on it.
You can scan it.

312
00:17:27,394 --> 00:17:29,057
It's adorable.

313
00:17:44,057 --> 00:17:46,417
It'll look happier if you add

314
00:17:47,016 --> 00:17:47,954
two more strokes here.

315
00:17:59,136 --> 00:17:59,969
Not bad at all.

316
00:18:03,817 --> 00:18:05,456
(He always called me Kid.)

317
00:18:06,576 --> 00:18:09,257
(And, he always caressed my head.)

318
00:18:09,377 --> 00:18:10,257
(He said)

319
00:18:10,576 --> 00:18:13,136
(my eyes were like a puppy's.)

320
00:18:13,896 --> 00:18:15,257
(Actually, I wanted to tell him)

321
00:18:16,016 --> 00:18:17,536
(that I was the wandering puppy.)

322
00:18:18,896 --> 00:18:19,937
I wanted him

323
00:18:21,377 --> 00:18:22,297
to bring me back.

324
00:18:24,456 --> 00:18:26,536
(I skipped my drawing classes.)

325
00:18:27,377 --> 00:18:29,977
(I even lied to my parents
in order to go outside.)

326
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:31,937
(But I was happy.)

327
00:18:34,136 --> 00:18:35,216
I don't know

328
00:18:35,216 --> 00:18:37,336
how I could treat him better.

329
00:18:38,057 --> 00:18:40,777
(That's why I gave him)

330
00:18:40,816 --> 00:18:41,766
(everything he wanted.)

331
00:18:47,897 --> 00:18:49,657
I could dig my heart out
if he wanted to see it.

332
00:18:54,936 --> 00:18:55,857
But I forgot.

333
00:18:56,816 --> 00:18:57,672
In my heart,

334
00:18:59,897 --> 00:19:00,977
there's a beast.

335
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,600
(I thought you're an
innocent and pure girl.)

336
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,364
(Nan, I'm sorry.)

337
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,525
(These are all excuses! You look so
innocent, why are you so complicated?)

338
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,000
(Of course I'm upset that
you don't belong to me.)

339
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,080
(Let's calm down for a while.)

340
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,042
(Meng Meng)

341
00:19:30,153 --> 00:19:30,919
(Call declined)

342
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,520
(Nan, please pick up my call.)

343
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,040
(I was wrong. What can I do
to make you forgive me?)

344
00:19:45,811 --> 00:19:46,760
(My heart aches when I see you.
I am a very possessive person.)

345
00:19:46,871 --> 00:19:48,040
(I can't concentrate on my contest these
days. I've never been like this before.)

346
00:19:48,151 --> 00:19:49,320
(I feel so sorry for myself. I despise
myself for falling in love with you.)

347
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,840
(Nan, I love you too. I'm willing to
do whatever you want me to do.)

348
00:19:55,128 --> 00:19:56,680
(Look at you, here you go again.)

349
00:19:56,756 --> 00:19:59,635
(You're willing to do anything
for every man.)

350
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,040
(No, I'm not.)

351
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,914
(Then prove to me
that you are only mine.)

352
00:20:18,216 --> 00:20:19,737
(I wanted him to forgive me)

353
00:20:19,816 --> 00:20:21,017
(no matter what I had to do.)

354
00:20:43,336 --> 00:20:44,497
(He's the key)

355
00:20:44,497 --> 00:20:46,497
(to keep the beast
in my heart in check.)

356
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:49,336
(I didn't want to
disappoint him anymore.)

357
00:20:49,857 --> 00:20:51,377
(I knew what I had to do.)

358
00:20:53,017 --> 00:20:54,216
As long as I stay obedient,

359
00:20:54,936 --> 00:20:55,977
he would smile.

360
00:20:57,737 --> 00:20:58,618
However,

361
00:21:01,377 --> 00:21:03,056
he was truly hard to please.

362
00:21:05,456 --> 00:21:08,617
Xu Meng, we'll perform fallectomy
on your left ovarian tube.

363
00:22:40,576 --> 00:22:41,497
(Encountering you guys)

364
00:22:42,017 --> 00:22:44,296
(might be the luckiest thing
that has happened to me.)

365
00:22:45,336 --> 00:22:46,336
(Over the past year,)

366
00:22:46,857 --> 00:22:49,137
I experienced a sense of relaxation
that I never had before.

367
00:22:49,137 --> 00:22:50,897
I love the smell of herbs
in the medical centre.

368
00:22:51,497 --> 00:22:52,977
I love everyone in the apprentice class.

369
00:22:54,576 --> 00:22:56,096
I like Jian Xi especially.

370
00:22:57,377 --> 00:22:58,296
When I saw her,

371
00:22:59,377 --> 00:23:00,296
I knew

372
00:23:00,857 --> 00:23:02,377
we could sympathize with each other.

373
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,696
Her body is handicapped

374
00:23:06,816 --> 00:23:08,336
while my mental state is handicapped.

375
00:23:14,257 --> 00:23:15,617
(I'm a vile girl.)

376
00:23:16,977 --> 00:23:19,096
(I don't deserve your kindness.)

377
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:21,096
It's excruciating

378
00:23:21,096 --> 00:23:22,377
whenever I see Tian Zhen.

379
00:23:24,377 --> 00:23:25,777
I'm so shameless.

380
00:23:26,576 --> 00:23:28,257
I haven't improved at all.

381
00:23:31,456 --> 00:23:33,456
I was born a sinner.

382
00:23:40,617 --> 00:23:41,737
(Nan looked for me lately.)

383
00:23:41,737 --> 00:23:42,977
(He said he couldn't forget about me.)

384
00:23:43,096 --> 00:23:45,696
Tou Tou, he has
my dirty secrets with him.

385
00:23:45,857 --> 00:23:46,737
I cannot escape from him.

386
00:23:46,977 --> 00:23:48,617
If he posts them online,

387
00:23:48,617 --> 00:23:50,056
my parents will be humiliated.

388
00:23:50,257 --> 00:23:51,257
Can you help me out?

389
00:23:51,576 --> 00:23:52,816
Tou Tou, I'm begging you.

390
00:23:52,857 --> 00:23:53,789
I'm begging you.

391
00:23:55,537 --> 00:23:56,377
Who are you calling?

392
00:23:57,497 --> 00:23:58,391
What are you doing?

393
00:23:58,737 --> 00:23:59,563
Give me your phone.

394
00:23:59,977 --> 00:24:00,813
Right now!

395
00:24:01,377 --> 00:24:02,188
Give it to me!

396
00:24:03,696 --> 00:24:04,816
Are you contacting that man again?

397
00:24:05,816 --> 00:24:07,737
How could you be so indiscreet?

398
00:24:07,816 --> 00:24:09,216
Can't you live without a man?

399
00:24:10,096 --> 00:24:11,576
Are you even our daughter?

400
00:24:17,436 --> 00:24:18,639
(Our tie is gone, our child is gone!)

401
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:19,969
(Remember, everything of yours
is mine. Don't say no to me.)

402
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,400
(If you can do it, I'll marry you.)

403
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,760
(I want to see you
and I can't forget you,)

404
00:24:29,785 --> 00:24:32,875
(but I can't bear to think of you living
in another man's house for over a year.)

405
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,235
(I haven't done anything,
I'm there to get treated.)

406
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,438
(Gastric lavage records
in the Emergency Department)

407
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,240
(Why don't you just let me die? The
thought of you with him makes me sick.)

408
00:25:00,283 --> 00:25:02,040
(Let me go. I can't live anymore.)

409
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,488
(Let's leave each other alone.
You need to stop this.)

410
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,640
(Let's end it here.
I won't look for you anymore.)

411
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:21,253
(When I miss you, I'll take a
look at the old photos and videos.)

412
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,320
(I beg you. Please delete them.)

413
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:41,440
(No, I want to keep them forever.)

414
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:43,596
(No!)

415
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:48,960
(No!)

416
00:25:49,025 --> 00:25:50,560
(Both of you aren't friends.
Please send him/her a friend request.)

417
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,360
(Nan.)

418
00:25:55,502 --> 00:25:56,560
(I beg you.)

419
00:25:56,804 --> 00:25:57,760
(Don't do that.)

420
00:26:10,696 --> 00:26:11,857
Do you know the term
PUA (emotional abuse)?

421
00:26:15,456 --> 00:26:16,857
Meng Meng was manipulated by him
through PUA.

422
00:26:19,096 --> 00:26:20,617
Meng Meng died because of him.

423
00:26:25,696 --> 00:26:27,696
We've been living together
with her for such a long time.

424
00:26:29,216 --> 00:26:31,377
We didn't realise that she was
suffering all the time.

425
00:26:33,737 --> 00:26:34,737
We can't just let him off.

426
00:26:37,857 --> 00:26:38,750
Tian Zhen.

427
00:26:40,696 --> 00:26:42,456
We can't just let him off.

428
00:26:43,296 --> 00:26:44,576
He killed Meng Meng.

429
00:26:44,816 --> 00:26:45,936
Meng Meng didn't take her own life.

430
00:26:46,176 --> 00:26:47,857
She died because of this scum.

431
00:26:48,096 --> 00:26:50,096
We have to uphold justice for her.

432
00:26:50,737 --> 00:26:51,857
Stop being childish.

433
00:26:52,096 --> 00:26:54,336
No law can punish people who cause
mental distress to others.

434
00:26:56,336 --> 00:26:57,137
You're not a lawyer.

435
00:26:57,137 --> 00:26:58,777
How would you know?

436
00:27:00,216 --> 00:27:01,017
Besides,

437
00:27:01,816 --> 00:27:02,774
we have this, right?

438
00:27:03,176 --> 00:27:04,416
We have the email Meng Meng sent to me.

439
00:27:04,617 --> 00:27:05,539
This is evidence.

440
00:27:06,096 --> 00:27:07,137
With this evidence,

441
00:27:07,617 --> 00:27:09,257
we can...

442
00:27:09,816 --> 00:27:11,816
We can make sure he gets
the punishment he deserves.

443
00:27:11,816 --> 00:27:12,649
I...

444
00:27:34,456 --> 00:27:36,096
Meng Meng fancied you, you know?

445
00:27:40,497 --> 00:27:41,456
If I knew

446
00:27:43,777 --> 00:27:45,017
it would end up this way,

447
00:27:46,137 --> 00:27:47,336
I would've...

448
00:27:49,617 --> 00:27:50,555
Would have what?

449
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:54,096
Would you give me to her?

450
00:28:11,977 --> 00:28:12,857
I have an idea.

451
00:28:15,857 --> 00:28:16,857
Our son

452
00:28:17,857 --> 00:28:19,696
truly has a lasting affection
for people.

453
00:28:21,416 --> 00:28:23,897
He may look fine in front of us,

454
00:28:24,497 --> 00:28:26,497
but he still hasn't gotten over
Meng Meng.

455
00:28:27,617 --> 00:28:28,576
How did you know?

456
00:28:30,936 --> 00:28:33,017
I heard Tou Tou consoling him

457
00:28:33,216 --> 00:28:34,456
when I went upstairs.

458
00:28:37,497 --> 00:28:39,456
It's good for these two kids
to be together.

459
00:28:40,017 --> 00:28:42,576
When one encounters
a relationship problem,

460
00:28:44,336 --> 00:28:45,377
there's at least someone there

461
00:28:46,137 --> 00:28:47,657
to hear them out.

462
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,756
Look.

463
00:28:50,257 --> 00:28:52,857
Only Tou Tou knew
where Tian Zhen went previously.

464
00:28:53,096 --> 00:28:54,336
When Tian Zhen is treating other people,

465
00:28:54,737 --> 00:28:56,296
Tou Tou helps him to recall the details.

466
00:29:02,737 --> 00:29:04,017
You kept saying

467
00:29:04,737 --> 00:29:07,737
that I didn't contribute anything
to the family.

468
00:29:08,096 --> 00:29:09,096
Look at the current situation.

469
00:29:10,017 --> 00:29:10,816
When Tian Zhen

470
00:29:12,216 --> 00:29:13,617
is facing his troubles,

471
00:29:13,977 --> 00:29:16,737
Tou Tou is there to keep him company.

472
00:29:16,737 --> 00:29:18,176
That's the largest contribution

473
00:29:18,216 --> 00:29:20,137
I've made to the family.

474
00:29:24,497 --> 00:29:25,375
Fine.

475
00:29:26,377 --> 00:29:28,857
I'll count it as your contribution.

476
00:29:31,977 --> 00:29:32,816
I just don't know

477
00:29:32,816 --> 00:29:35,336
when our son can get over her.

478
00:29:42,777 --> 00:29:45,017
Lastly, I would like to thank
the academy and the party committee

479
00:29:45,017 --> 00:29:45,936
for giving me a chance

480
00:29:45,936 --> 00:29:47,737
to participate in
the aid education event.

481
00:29:47,977 --> 00:29:49,416
I could help out those in need

482
00:29:49,416 --> 00:29:50,936
with what I have learned.

483
00:29:51,056 --> 00:29:52,216
In the future, I will do my best

484
00:29:52,216 --> 00:29:54,377
not to disappoint
my lecturers and seniors.

485
00:29:54,576 --> 00:29:57,096
I will strive to improve myself
no matter if it's my studies or career.

486
00:29:57,096 --> 00:29:58,456
I will help more people

487
00:29:58,456 --> 00:29:59,440
to build and fulfil their dreams.

488
00:29:59,816 --> 00:30:00,857
Thank you, everyone.

489
00:30:01,377 --> 00:30:02,657
Alright. Let's thank our senior.

490
00:30:03,617 --> 00:30:06,176
Senior, there's a prize-giving ceremony.

491
00:30:06,617 --> 00:30:09,176
Let's welcome the leaders of the academy
to get on the stage for a group photo.

492
00:30:09,416 --> 00:30:10,696
We'll follow the name list
for individual winners first.

493
00:30:10,696 --> 00:30:11,737
After that, we'll take a group photo.

494
00:30:11,737 --> 00:30:12,777
-Okay?
-Got it.

495
00:30:12,897 --> 00:30:13,777
Stage manager,

496
00:30:13,777 --> 00:30:16,017
remember to control the time allocation
for this session.

497
00:30:16,017 --> 00:30:18,137
Tell the prize givers
to get into position early.

498
00:30:18,137 --> 00:30:19,336
-Okay?
-Okay.

499
00:30:19,777 --> 00:30:21,017
Once the teachers leave the stage...

500
00:30:21,017 --> 00:30:22,416
Senior, someone's looking for you.

501
00:30:22,497 --> 00:30:24,216
We can call the name
of the next presenter.

502
00:30:24,737 --> 00:30:26,416
Alright. We'll skip the MC's lines.

503
00:30:26,497 --> 00:30:28,576
-Okay, thank you.
-Next presenter, get on the stage.

504
00:30:30,456 --> 00:30:32,176
Hello, everyone. I'm Yu Guo Rong.

505
00:30:32,336 --> 00:30:33,936
First, I would like to thank our academy

506
00:30:33,936 --> 00:30:35,216
to give me this chance.

507
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,440
Next,

508
00:30:36,456 --> 00:30:37,576
I will keep working hard...

509
00:30:42,737 --> 00:30:43,696
Who exactly are you guys?

510
00:30:44,497 --> 00:30:46,456
We know the dirty deeds you've done.

511
00:30:47,857 --> 00:30:49,017
What dirty deeds?

512
00:30:49,336 --> 00:30:50,777
We were dating each other.

513
00:30:50,777 --> 00:30:51,857
And, she was an adult.

514
00:30:53,257 --> 00:30:54,243
I'm sure you have no idea

515
00:30:54,617 --> 00:30:56,176
that she sent her conversation with you

516
00:30:56,216 --> 00:30:57,096
to us before her death.

517
00:30:59,336 --> 00:31:00,258
I didn't do anything.

518
00:31:01,176 --> 00:31:02,737
If you guys are talking about

519
00:31:02,737 --> 00:31:03,737
her spending money on me,

520
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:05,777
I admit. She did buy many gifts for me.

521
00:31:05,816 --> 00:31:06,737
But I did return the favour.

522
00:31:07,216 --> 00:31:08,897
Isn't it normal for a couple

523
00:31:09,497 --> 00:31:10,497
to buy gifts for each other?

524
00:31:10,497 --> 00:31:11,414
Are you sure it's normal?

525
00:31:12,017 --> 00:31:13,096
She was underage.

526
00:31:13,336 --> 00:31:15,096
You seduced, harmed,

527
00:31:15,336 --> 00:31:16,857
humiliated, and manipulated

528
00:31:16,857 --> 00:31:18,017
an underage girl.

529
00:31:18,456 --> 00:31:19,305
Do you think that's normal?

530
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:21,737
Please mind your words.

531
00:31:21,977 --> 00:31:24,017
Yes, she was underage
when we were dating each other.

532
00:31:24,017 --> 00:31:25,257
But I didn't force her.

533
00:31:25,377 --> 00:31:26,576
It was a normal relationship.

534
00:31:27,497 --> 00:31:28,696
As for the rest that you've said,

535
00:31:28,977 --> 00:31:29,836
sorry about that.

536
00:31:30,017 --> 00:31:31,216
-I didn't do any of that.
-You didn't?

537
00:31:33,617 --> 00:31:34,563
Yeah, as if.

538
00:31:35,816 --> 00:31:37,216
It's because you blocked her profile.

539
00:31:38,336 --> 00:31:40,096
It's because of what you've done.

540
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:43,017
That's the reason
Meng Meng took her life.

541
00:31:43,617 --> 00:31:45,617
That's why she died!

542
00:31:45,696 --> 00:31:47,017
You know that the best.

543
00:31:51,977 --> 00:31:52,857
I'm very sorry

544
00:31:53,497 --> 00:31:54,399
to hear about her death.

545
00:31:56,377 --> 00:31:57,777
However, this has nothing to do with me.

546
00:31:59,137 --> 00:32:00,416
We already broke up.

547
00:32:01,137 --> 00:32:01,936
The law doesn't state

548
00:32:02,056 --> 00:32:03,257
that it will punish people
who block other people's accounts.

549
00:32:03,336 --> 00:32:04,537
You tortured her mentally.

550
00:32:04,696 --> 00:32:05,857
She did the same!

551
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,255
I don't know

552
00:32:12,336 --> 00:32:13,137
how to explain

553
00:32:13,137 --> 00:32:14,336
the relationship between
me and Meng Meng.

554
00:32:14,456 --> 00:32:15,936
We did it out of mutual consent.

555
00:32:17,096 --> 00:32:18,857
Yes, she might be obsessed.

556
00:32:18,936 --> 00:32:20,576
But it's not like
I've never struggled with it.

557
00:32:20,816 --> 00:32:21,688
Besides,

558
00:32:21,977 --> 00:32:22,857
outsiders

559
00:32:23,456 --> 00:32:24,977
shouldn't judge
other people's relationships.

560
00:32:31,497 --> 00:32:32,368
Fine.

561
00:32:33,257 --> 00:32:35,936
Why did you threaten her
with intimate photos

562
00:32:36,216 --> 00:32:37,133
and videos then?

563
00:32:37,737 --> 00:32:38,696
Do you have any evidence of that?

564
00:32:39,377 --> 00:32:40,336
Listen,

565
00:32:41,096 --> 00:32:42,737
you need to pay the consequences
if you spread false rumours.

566
00:32:43,056 --> 00:32:43,977
Are you even humane?

567
00:32:45,017 --> 00:32:46,497
A girl took her own life because of you.

568
00:32:46,497 --> 00:32:48,056
How could you be so nonchalant about it?

569
00:32:48,336 --> 00:32:49,216
Do you think you know her well?

570
00:32:51,576 --> 00:32:52,377
Do you guys even know

571
00:32:52,377 --> 00:32:53,416
the kind of girl she was?

572
00:32:58,096 --> 00:32:59,617
Do you know how wild Meng Meng was?

573
00:33:01,576 --> 00:33:03,137
Do you guys know why she fell for me?

574
00:33:09,216 --> 00:33:10,102
Tian Zhen!

575
00:33:10,857 --> 00:33:12,056
Tian Zhen, there are
surveillance cameras here.

576
00:33:12,282 --> 00:33:13,196
We're in the school.

577
00:33:13,296 --> 00:33:14,217
Listen up.

578
00:33:15,936 --> 00:33:16,977
You better stop harassing me.

579
00:33:18,137 --> 00:33:19,897
I'm emotionally unstable.

580
00:33:20,176 --> 00:33:21,296
If you do trigger me,

581
00:33:21,857 --> 00:33:22,857
it'd be a shame

582
00:33:23,377 --> 00:33:24,456
for certain videos

583
00:33:25,137 --> 00:33:26,257
to get leaked on the Internet.

584
00:33:31,336 --> 00:33:32,297
Tou Tou!

585
00:33:34,056 --> 00:33:35,019
There are surveillance cameras here.

586
00:33:44,857 --> 00:33:46,216
We recorded it for nothing.

587
00:33:47,497 --> 00:33:49,336
He didn't disclose
any useful information.

588
00:33:52,257 --> 00:33:54,137
A fair face may hide a foul heart, huh?

589
00:33:54,816 --> 00:33:55,857
A person like him

590
00:33:55,857 --> 00:33:57,137
is actually an outstanding
academic cadre?

591
00:33:59,216 --> 00:34:00,336
He's rotten to the core.

592
00:34:01,576 --> 00:34:02,617
You shouldn't have stopped me just now.

593
00:34:03,216 --> 00:34:04,497
I should've beat him up.

594
00:34:09,816 --> 00:34:11,497
You may vent our anger

595
00:34:11,497 --> 00:34:12,857
by beating him up.

596
00:34:12,993 --> 00:34:13,902
But have you

597
00:34:14,936 --> 00:34:16,296
thought about the consequences?

598
00:34:16,576 --> 00:34:17,897
Do you think it can resolve the issue?

599
00:34:36,617 --> 00:34:37,497
Why don't we seek the opinion of

600
00:34:37,497 --> 00:34:39,137
someone smarter than us?

601
00:34:45,857 --> 00:34:47,456
Are you guys idiots?

602
00:34:49,336 --> 00:34:51,816
Do you think everything will work out
if you confront that scum?

603
00:34:53,576 --> 00:34:56,456
I thought he would be afraid
if we exposed him.

604
00:34:58,257 --> 00:34:59,617
Tou, seems like
you're green in that regard.

605
00:34:59,857 --> 00:35:01,377
A PUA top dog like him

606
00:35:01,377 --> 00:35:03,257
is a classic case of
hermit crab personality.

607
00:35:03,617 --> 00:35:05,096
Such people love

608
00:35:05,096 --> 00:35:06,857
to control the right to speak,

609
00:35:07,096 --> 00:35:08,576
sense of control, and superiority
in their relationships

610
00:35:08,977 --> 00:35:10,977
and cause the other party
to feel inferior

611
00:35:10,977 --> 00:35:11,977
and lose their sense of identity.

612
00:35:12,497 --> 00:35:13,617
The most notable feature of such people

613
00:35:13,617 --> 00:35:14,576
is that they're extremely narcissistic.

614
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:16,977
And, they always think that
they're above the rules of morality.

615
00:35:17,216 --> 00:35:18,977
People like him won't be afraid
even if people try to expose him.

616
00:35:19,497 --> 00:35:21,096
Scientifically, it's called

617
00:35:21,096 --> 00:35:23,056
a narcissistic personality disorder.

618
00:35:23,296 --> 00:35:24,696
Also known as NPD.

619
00:35:25,377 --> 00:35:26,308
Peng Shi Yan,

620
00:35:26,617 --> 00:35:28,216
seems like you're pretty experienced.

621
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,360
That's not it.

622
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:30,456
Although I'm straight and frank,

623
00:35:30,497 --> 00:35:31,617
I'm not a jerk.

624
00:35:31,617 --> 00:35:33,216
I respect women.

625
00:35:33,336 --> 00:35:34,216
Rebecca,

626
00:35:34,336 --> 00:35:36,777
can we use the chat record
as our evidence then?

627
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:40,936
Although all of us know

628
00:35:40,936 --> 00:35:42,257
that this man is a scum,

629
00:35:42,816 --> 00:35:44,257
he's not wrong.

630
00:35:44,297 --> 00:35:46,537
He did have a willing relationship

631
00:35:46,537 --> 00:35:48,416
with Meng Meng previously.

632
00:35:49,017 --> 00:35:50,777
It's just that he manipulated Meng Meng

633
00:35:50,777 --> 00:35:52,537
in their relationship.

634
00:35:52,616 --> 00:35:54,497
And, your chat records

635
00:35:54,537 --> 00:35:55,456
can only prove

636
00:35:55,456 --> 00:35:56,856
that Meng Meng was in a passive stance

637
00:35:56,856 --> 00:35:58,057
in their relationship.

638
00:35:59,136 --> 00:36:01,097
However, you cannot accuse him
with this as your evidence.

639
00:36:01,696 --> 00:36:03,057
I should've beat him up just now.

640
00:36:03,737 --> 00:36:04,817
Here's a friendly reminder.

641
00:36:05,017 --> 00:36:06,297
Intentional injury is a crime.

642
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:07,416
You'll be convicted for that.

643
00:36:07,977 --> 00:36:09,337
It's infuriating

644
00:36:09,337 --> 00:36:11,057
that we can't do anything about him

645
00:36:11,057 --> 00:36:12,537
even though we know he's the culprit.

646
00:36:13,097 --> 00:36:14,497
Meng Meng suffered for so long.

647
00:36:14,537 --> 00:36:15,577
But that scum?

648
00:36:15,577 --> 00:36:17,977
He got sponsored for his studies
and received numerous awards.

649
00:36:19,257 --> 00:36:20,497
This is truly ridiculous.

650
00:36:20,737 --> 00:36:21,537
Roubecca,

651
00:36:21,537 --> 00:36:22,497
help me check the law

652
00:36:23,297 --> 00:36:25,057
and tell me how long I have to
be imprisoned for beating him up.

653
00:36:25,777 --> 00:36:27,616
There's no need to take such a risk.

654
00:36:28,777 --> 00:36:30,057
It's not like we have no way

655
00:36:30,456 --> 00:36:31,777
to make him pay the price.

656
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:32,737
What do you mean?

657
00:36:33,537 --> 00:36:36,297
Beyond the law, we have public order
and good customs.

658
00:36:36,737 --> 00:36:40,136
Let's give him a taste
of his own medicine.

659
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:44,200
(PUA is not love! Death of an angel!
Caused by academic cadre!)

660
00:36:44,519 --> 00:36:47,920
(Suicide incident of a female student.
Zhang Jia Nan was the cause)

661
00:36:48,089 --> 00:36:51,420
(Academic cadre of Jiangzhou University
caused the death of a female student)

662
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:53,400
(The entire story of the PUA incident)

663
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,920
(PUA and emotional manipulation,
suspected of at least five crimes)

664
00:36:56,333 --> 00:36:58,480
(Evil PUA: Manipulating a woman
to take her own life)

665
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,240
(PUA equals intentional homicide)

666
00:37:00,537 --> 00:37:01,520
Roubecca!

667
00:37:04,057 --> 00:37:05,856
You're amazing.

668
00:37:06,257 --> 00:37:08,057
All these netizens are powerful.

669
00:37:08,057 --> 00:37:09,856
Their criticisms were right on point.

670
00:37:10,497 --> 00:37:11,817
That's why I said

671
00:37:12,057 --> 00:37:13,577
we must hit where it hurts.

672
00:37:13,737 --> 00:37:15,856
We have to launch a pre-emptive strike.

673
00:37:15,856 --> 00:37:17,416
You're the smartest person alive.

674
00:37:17,737 --> 00:37:19,017
Let's see if he dares to post
those photos and videos

675
00:37:19,017 --> 00:37:21,297
after this incident.

676
00:37:21,777 --> 00:37:22,616
If he does,

677
00:37:22,737 --> 00:37:24,936
the netizens will drown him
with their criticisms.

678
00:37:25,257 --> 00:37:26,537
This will be recorded on the Internet.

679
00:37:26,737 --> 00:37:28,696
He'll be shamed forever.

680
00:37:30,537 --> 00:37:31,456
Tian Zhen,

681
00:37:31,696 --> 00:37:33,216
you're too naive.

682
00:37:33,297 --> 00:37:35,497
You're overestimating
the power of the Internet.

683
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:37,456
I dealt with such a case once.

684
00:37:37,656 --> 00:37:39,216
A man murdered his wife.

685
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:40,537
He was only sentenced
to seven years in prison.

686
00:37:40,537 --> 00:37:42,616
He remarried right after
his sentence was over.

687
00:37:43,497 --> 00:37:45,136
As for Zhang Jia Nan, I think

688
00:37:45,136 --> 00:37:46,577
he'll be imprisoned
for less than 20 years.

689
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:48,696
After that, he can do whatever he wants

690
00:37:48,737 --> 00:37:49,616
and whitewash his name.

691
00:37:54,153 --> 00:37:55,074
That's fine.

692
00:37:55,696 --> 00:37:58,017
We can sue him again
after his sentence is over.

693
00:38:13,577 --> 00:38:14,519
Wait.

694
00:38:15,057 --> 00:38:16,136
What's going on?

695
00:38:18,577 --> 00:38:20,297
Why is Zhao Li Quan moving out?

696
00:38:23,057 --> 00:38:24,136
Did you tell him to move out?

697
00:38:29,017 --> 00:38:30,376
I thought you liked him?

698
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:32,297
Why did you reject him?

699
00:38:37,017 --> 00:38:38,176
Don't you feel terrible?

700
00:38:42,416 --> 00:38:44,176
Tian Xing Xing, I'm talking to you.

701
00:38:48,176 --> 00:38:48,977
Listen.

702
00:38:50,936 --> 00:38:53,057
After studying under my master
for some time,

703
00:38:53,896 --> 00:38:55,017
I learned about

704
00:38:55,017 --> 00:38:56,777
what was existent and what was not.

705
00:38:57,416 --> 00:38:58,416
When you pick up a skill,

706
00:38:58,416 --> 00:38:59,416
it's existent.

707
00:39:00,696 --> 00:39:01,620
Wealth

708
00:39:01,737 --> 00:39:03,337
and material are non-existent.

709
00:39:03,616 --> 00:39:04,817
Houses,

710
00:39:04,817 --> 00:39:06,737
materialistic needs,

711
00:39:06,777 --> 00:39:07,777
all of them are non-existent.

712
00:39:08,416 --> 00:39:09,616
You don't have them at birth, and
you can't take them to the grave.

713
00:39:09,616 --> 00:39:10,616
They're meaningless.

714
00:39:11,266 --> 00:39:12,253
I'm serious.

715
00:39:14,257 --> 00:39:16,616
Two lives had been lost
in front of my eyes.

716
00:39:17,456 --> 00:39:20,097
No matter if they're wealthy or not,
they die the same way.

717
00:39:20,337 --> 00:39:21,737
It's not important at all.

718
00:39:23,777 --> 00:39:25,497
Hey, I'm talking to you.

719
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:28,589
Let me ask you this then.

720
00:39:28,817 --> 00:39:29,896
Would you choose

721
00:39:30,097 --> 00:39:31,297
Zhao Li Quan if you were in my shoes?

722
00:39:31,337 --> 00:39:32,777
I would choose him.

723
00:39:32,817 --> 00:39:33,856
You wouldn't say that in the past.

724
00:39:33,856 --> 00:39:34,977
Of course I would.

725
00:39:35,017 --> 00:39:35,856
You wouldn't.

726
00:39:35,856 --> 00:39:37,057
I would.

727
00:39:45,136 --> 00:39:46,577
Both of us were penniless

728
00:39:46,577 --> 00:39:47,656
when we lived together.

729
00:39:47,656 --> 00:39:49,337
Even so, we enjoyed ourselves, right?

730
00:39:49,337 --> 00:39:51,136
It's because we would
never be able to have children together.

731
00:39:53,696 --> 00:39:54,667
Come here.

732
00:39:57,656 --> 00:39:58,537
Lend me a hand.

733
00:40:02,856 --> 00:40:03,777
I'll take this too.

734
00:40:04,706 --> 00:40:05,636
Where are you going?

735
00:40:06,018 --> 00:40:06,979
That's mine.

736
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:09,977
Why are you folding this then?

737
00:40:10,017 --> 00:40:10,817
I'm putting it over there.

738
00:40:11,376 --> 00:40:12,277
You...

739
00:40:12,817 --> 00:40:13,956
Which of these belongs to him then?

740
00:40:16,057 --> 00:40:17,097
Enough.

741
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:29,081
Tou Tou,

742
00:40:29,497 --> 00:40:31,176
you didn't eat much

743
00:40:31,176 --> 00:40:32,337
during dinner time.

744
00:40:33,817 --> 00:40:34,656
Let's have a chat.

745
00:40:35,416 --> 00:40:36,456
Are you troubled

746
00:40:37,337 --> 00:40:38,297
by something?

747
00:40:41,257 --> 00:40:42,737
Didn't you say

748
00:40:43,017 --> 00:40:45,337
that if we will it,
our wish will come true?

749
00:40:46,497 --> 00:40:47,896
But I realise that
it doesn't work that way

750
00:40:47,896 --> 00:40:49,176
in reality.

751
00:40:50,577 --> 00:40:51,856
For example, Meng Meng

752
00:40:52,656 --> 00:40:53,613
and Xing Xing.

753
00:40:55,376 --> 00:40:56,656
Both of their wishes didn't come true.

754
00:40:58,017 --> 00:41:00,537
If we will it, our wish will come true.

755
00:41:02,097 --> 00:41:04,337
If everyone could will
their wish into existence,

756
00:41:04,577 --> 00:41:05,497
killers

757
00:41:05,977 --> 00:41:06,777
would kill

758
00:41:07,257 --> 00:41:09,216
and gamblers would gamble and win

759
00:41:09,537 --> 00:41:10,616
all the time, right?

760
00:41:10,777 --> 00:41:12,097
I'm not referring to crooks.

761
00:41:12,257 --> 00:41:13,777
I'm referring to good things.

762
00:41:16,176 --> 00:41:18,176
If so, how can we will

763
00:41:18,337 --> 00:41:20,017
our wish into existence?

764
00:41:22,577 --> 00:41:23,519
Your heart

765
00:41:23,737 --> 00:41:24,605
must retain its initial goal.

766
00:41:24,817 --> 00:41:26,097
And, your mind must be mindful.

767
00:41:26,577 --> 00:41:27,376
Your heart

768
00:41:28,257 --> 00:41:29,497
must start with right

769
00:41:30,416 --> 00:41:31,896
and end with right.

770
00:41:34,817 --> 00:41:35,808
What do you mean by right?

771
00:41:37,297 --> 00:41:39,176
Analytical Dictionary of Chinese
Characters explained it clearly.

772
00:41:39,817 --> 00:41:41,616
To right is to one.

773
00:41:42,537 --> 00:41:43,537
What do you mean by one?

774
00:41:43,737 --> 00:41:44,777
One, as in the Tao produced one.

775
00:41:45,017 --> 00:41:46,817
The simpler your heart is,

776
00:41:47,337 --> 00:41:50,057
the closer to the Tao,
and the closer you are to one.

777
00:41:53,097 --> 00:41:54,019
I don't understand.

778
00:41:55,017 --> 00:41:55,977
Give me an example.

779
00:41:57,497 --> 00:41:59,176
You see, when we do something,

780
00:42:00,577 --> 00:42:01,497
we shouldn't

781
00:42:01,497 --> 00:42:03,817
do it for ourselves.
We should do it for other people's sake.

782
00:42:03,817 --> 00:42:05,097
We must seek welfare for others

783
00:42:05,097 --> 00:42:06,577
and society itself.

784
00:42:07,136 --> 00:42:09,737
By then, when you think,

785
00:42:10,337 --> 00:42:12,616
you can gather power from all directions

786
00:42:13,176 --> 00:42:14,257
and accomplish your goal.

787
00:42:16,136 --> 00:42:18,136
There's an idiom called

788
00:42:18,257 --> 00:42:19,577
"Unity is strength".

789
00:42:22,057 --> 00:42:24,337
If you only wish

790
00:42:24,577 --> 00:42:26,777
to benefit yourself by helping

791
00:42:26,977 --> 00:42:28,977
other people out,

792
00:42:29,017 --> 00:42:30,057
that's not the right mindset.

793
00:42:31,297 --> 00:42:33,097
That's why you cannot
accomplish your goals.

794
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,847
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

795
00:42:36,902 --> 00:42:38,300
(are referenced from relevant
traditional Chinese medicine books)

796
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,885
(Do not use without medical advice)
