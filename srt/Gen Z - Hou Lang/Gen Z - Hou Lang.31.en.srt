1
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,320
To work for the benefit of others
and for the benefit of society,

2
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,480
if your heart is in the right place,

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,400
you'll be able to bring together
all the forces from all directions

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:14,960
to make things happen.

5
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,840
That's why there is this saying,

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,280
"unity is strength".

7
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,120
So, if a person thinks of

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,560
getting something out of this guy

9
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,600
and something out of that guy every day,

10
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:30,920
his heart is not in the right place,

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,040
so he can't do a good job.

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,720
Even if he can,

13
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,160
he will need to pay in double.

14
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:43,960
Master.

15
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,680
Well, I have a friend.

16
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,600
Previously, she has had this

17
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,920
impure

18
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,640
and thoughts for personal gain.

19
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,037
But it so happened that
her wishes are fulfilled.

20
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:58,920
What should she do?

21
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,237
You should do more good deeds then

22
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,360
to slowly repay it,

23
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,720
but provided that

24
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,400
you can't be too wrong.

25
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,640
How do you know it's me?

26
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,640
No, it's not me.

27
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:13,760
I know.

28
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,760
It's my friend.

29
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,920
I'm doomed!

30
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,000
I keep thinking about it and...

31
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,040
And this time,
Meng Meng asked me for help.

32
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,160
But I missed it.

33
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,280
If I keep losing points like this,

34
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,357
I can't be a TCM practitioner?

35
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,077
You can.

36
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,117
Can I?

37
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,920
It's just that you're
not very skilled in treating patients.

38
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,720
That doesn't work either.

39
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,080
Look, a brilliant doctor

40
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,720
is someone virtuous.

41
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,400
That's to say,
many people are grateful to him.

42
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:56,517
The more this gratitude is gathered.

43
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,720
it'll become like...

44
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,400
The legs of compasses.

45
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,720
It will get longer

46
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,837
and the circle will become bigger.

47
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,440
Thus, more people are covered.

48
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,120
He's not like the inexperienced doctor
like you who has short legs.

49
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,800
Take your time. You'll get better.

50
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,440
I feel tasteless.

51
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,640
How great it'd be
if there's a piece of cake to eat.

52
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,560
It's been a while since the last time
we celebrate a happy occasion.

53
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,200
Why doesn't anyone have a birthday?

54
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,720
There seems to be someone in our family
who hasn't celebrated a birthday yet.

55
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,560
Tou Tou.

56
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,440
Grandpa.

57
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:11,080
I want
the chestnut cake with thick cream.

58
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,320
Tou Tou should be choosing the cake
since it's her birthday.

59
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,880
Let's not tell her first.
Let's surprise her.

60
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,517
She grew up in a welfare home.

61
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,477
She doesn't even know when
her birthday is. How is she celebrating?

62
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,160
The more she needs to celebrate it.

63
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,917
This is a philosophical proposition.

64
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,160
Humans need to know

65
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,077
where they come from and where they go,

66
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,880
if they are materialistic or idealistic.

67
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,520
Alright.

68
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,000
We've decided then.

69
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,197
Aren't we going to make
rice wine in two days?

70
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,640
Order the cake as well.

71
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,560
Chestnut cake with thick cream.

72
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,080
Grandpa.

73
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,080
You are trying to kill me.

74
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,800
If I really order that cake,

75
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,917
my mom and grandma
will play women's doubles

76
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,440
and push me to the ground
and beat me repeatedly?

77
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,360
Well, I keep you little thing

78
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,277
just so that
you can take the beatings for me.

79
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,720
Okay, Grandpa.

80
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,240
Thick cream, okay?

81
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,680
By the way, Master, that...

82
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,000
Have you watched Meng Meng's video?

83
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,680
What do you have in mind?

84
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,680
It's all in the past.

85
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,960
Let Meng Meng rest in peace.

86
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,920
I think...

87
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,080
I think no matter what,

88
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,800
we should show it to her parents.

89
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,080
I think they
have misunderstood their daughter.

90
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,000
Who knows? It might be pathological.

91
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,720
Look, in the end,

92
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,080
a girl like her

93
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,317
walked away with shame.

94
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,320
We didn't care about her.

95
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,680
I just feel that it's quite...

96
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,960
Those were Meng Meng's last words.

97
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,400
She wrote to you.

98
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,680
It's her trust in you.

99
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,320
I think

100
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,280
let's not tell her parents.

101
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,080
If her parents know what she did
was because of her illness,

102
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,520
they will regret it forever.

103
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,920
So, let's not do things like this.

104
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,880
In the end,

105
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,640
we just hope that those who are alive

106
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,160
live better.

107
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,000
Those who are alive live better.

108
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,840
Drink some dried tangerine peel.

109
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,960
Why did you drag me here?

110
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,960
I want to confess something to you.

111
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,360
What bad thing did you do?

112
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,560
Your dad said this.

113
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,960
We can't simply wish for something

114
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,840
and have it come true.

115
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,160
If we do that, we will be punished.

116
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,400
Does my dad need to tell you this?
Animated cartoons have taught us.

117
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,440
For example, in "Lao Mountain Taoist",

118
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,520
and "The Story of the Goldfish
and the Farmer", it's in these cartoons.

119
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,200
Actually, I came here

120
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,840
half of it is because of money.

121
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,760
The other half is because...

122
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,440
Because of what?

123
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,480
Because I want to court you.

124
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,997
Such a bold idea.

125
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,600
How could you have this thought?

126
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,717
And you even succeeded.

127
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,000
That's right!

128
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,597
I didn't know it would come true.

129
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,357
And why would
your dad pass this down to me?

130
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,240
I didn't know it was so powerful.

131
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,280
Looks like you've gotten
my dad's handed-down teachings.

132
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,957
You've ruined my life.

133
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,000
-You'll have to pay back.
-I will pay you back.

134
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,000
How are you going to pay?

135
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:28,920
Let me.

136
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,760
How are you going to pay?

137
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,440
Break up.

138
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,200
What?

139
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,920
Break up.

140
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,640
That's impossible.

141
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,360
How could you return it
when your wish has come true?

142
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,240
I must return this.

143
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,157
The wishes I want to make
are very precious.

144
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,280
And I want to use it
in Chinese medicine.

145
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,317
All the merits
I have accumulated so hard

146
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,637
are all gone because of this.

147
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,757
It's not worth it at all.

148
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,400
Please understand me.

149
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,997
I feel very bad, really.

150
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,717
I'm being torn too.

151
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,557
But there's nothing I can do.

152
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,680
Starting now,

153
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,960
let's just

154
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,040
pretend nothing has happened, okay?

155
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,440
Sun Tou Tou.

156
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,800
Who do you take me for?

157
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,440
You haven't learned my father's skills,
but you've become like him.

158
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,597
I never understood why my mom
was always angry with my dad.

159
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,640
But I understand now.

160
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,477
Whenever there is a conflict
about Chinese medicine,

161
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,397
my mom will be the one
who is sacrificed.

162
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,160
Your dad has said this.

163
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,520
-Willing...
-No.

164
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,157
You can't do this.

165
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,480
Like me at this second and then
doesn't like me in the next second.

166
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,040
But we'll only get something
if we let go of others.

167
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,800
Confucius also said that

168
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,680
humans can do anything they like
as long as they don't break the rules.

169
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,640
Ask your heart.

170
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,480
Do you want to let me go or get me?

171
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,280
I don't know!

172
00:09:02,852 --> 00:09:04,000
I know.

173
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,280
It's easy.

174
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,120
Just put your mind
into Chinese medicine.

175
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,240
As for our matter,

176
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,600
let me get an idea about it.

177
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,320
Let me think about it.

178
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,920
What does this mean?

179
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,120
I'm getting an idea.

180
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,800
You should do this.

181
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,160
Alright.

182
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,477
The merits I accumulated
over the past twenty years

183
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,957
is used on our matter.

184
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:41,960
You're still mine.

185
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,880
What about the merits you
accumulate for the rest of your life?

186
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,600
I'll keep it for my
other favorite things in the future.

187
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,880
Hey, decency is no joke.

188
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,397
I said "favorite things",
not "favorite person".

189
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,600
What are you worried about?

190
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,680
I guess it's becoming a good doctor.

191
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,040
Me too.

192
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,160
Bingo.

193
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,240
(Autumn heralds the end of summer.)

194
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,037
(Beware of the "autumn tiger",

195
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,280
the interim season of sweltering heat
before the temperatures plummet.)

196
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:59,080
(When the weather is turning cold,

197
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,800
the crops begin to ripen as well.)

198
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,720
(Beginning of Autumn)

199
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,800
Come, come. Have a seat.

200
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,680
Zhao.

201
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:32,000
You've been here for three months.

202
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,440
-Yes.
-How do you feel?

203
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,240
At first, I didn't know how to do it.

204
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,560
But I'm good at it now.

205
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,800
Colleagues treat me well.

206
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,920
Look at you.

207
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,240
A talented student after all!
Your learning ability is different.

208
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,160
Mr. Wu really gave us a good person.

209
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,320
Thank you, sir.

210
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,480
Zhao, I asked for you today

211
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,360
because I have something
to ask for your help.

212
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,520
Ask for my help?

213
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,000
Sir, how can I help you?

214
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,240
Take a seat.

215
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,480
You can do it.

216
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,557
Take it easy.

217
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,320
I'm not asking you to blow up bunkers.

218
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,520
Recently,

219
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,680
we've gotten the batch number of
that batch of new medicine for the flu.

220
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,320
You know of this, right?

221
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,920
Yes.

222
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,840
My first task was this medicine.

223
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,120
I won't say much about
the general information.

224
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,720
Well, it's like this.

225
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,800
The company

226
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,840
wants to push
for this medicine this year.

227
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,957
It's best if it can be
in the standing medicine list

228
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,080
of the tertiary hospitals in the city.

229
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,000
According to the process, tenders
will be carried out in each hospital.

230
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,320
And we're about
to put out the tender.

231
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,560
So, what I mean is,

232
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,120
I want to ask Mr. Wu for help

233
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,120
and see if he can reveal

234
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,320
other companies'

235
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,320
base price.

236
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,160
Look.

237
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,880
You're Mr. Wu's disciple
and recommended by him.

238
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,680
Go and talk to him

239
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,360
about this.

240
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,000
Sir.

241
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,717
I don't know Mr. Wu very well.

242
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,120
It's not suitable for me
to talk about this.

243
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,760
It's suitable.

244
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,040
It's suitable.

245
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,480
This is our tender.

246
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,880
And this.

247
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,000
Bring this along for Mr. Wu.

248
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,920
What does this mean?

249
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,360
This card is issued in your name.

250
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,320
The password
are the last six digits of your ID.

251
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:35,880
Send this to him.

252
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,320
He just needs to spend it.

253
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,920
The amount here is not the final amount.

254
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,480
As long as Mr. Wu wants,

255
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,560
he can just name a figure
and you just let me know.

256
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,640
A card issued in my name?

257
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,600
That's right.

258
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,000
Zhao.

259
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,680
Take it easy.

260
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,560
You're just a messenger for us.

261
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,400
If he is okay,

262
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,600
then everyone will be happy.

263
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,160
If he's not okay,

264
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,480
you just return the card to me.

265
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,560
This has nothing to do with you.

266
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,200
But

267
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,600
if you manage to do this,

268
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,000
the sales from the hospitals,

269
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,040
I'll give you one point.

270
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,760
As for how much this one point is,

271
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,640
I guess you don't need me

272
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,720
to calculate for you, right?

273
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,440
Mr. Wu.

274
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,917
There are many
skilled physicians in our center.

275
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,800
Why did you choose
Tou Tou who hasn't graduated?

276
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,917
Well, I think Tou Tou is good.

277
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,320
Moreover, you're doing business here.

278
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,917
I can't take away the spots from others.

279
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,800
You're right.

280
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,320
Hero, please be merciful.

281
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,680
You have a lot of strength
but my body is soft.

282
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,600
It's still a bit lacking.

283
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,240
Don't worry, Senior.

284
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,200
I will hold back

285
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,040
when I massage you

286
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,760
I won't put in a lot of strength.

287
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,320
If you think I'm doing well today,

288
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,200
please compliment me
in front of Ms. Dong.

289
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,200
I want to officially do this too.

290
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,560
What now?

291
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,880
Consultation with your master
doesn't make money?

292
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,240
I'm not doing this for money.

293
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,120
I'm doing this to gain
more length for the compasses.

294
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,080
You know about compasses legs too?

295
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,319
Do you know
where this theory came from?

296
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,280
I don't know.

297
00:15:31,361 --> 00:15:32,797
Anyway, Master told me that.

298
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,200
It sounds reasonable to me.

299
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,800
He got that theory from me.

300
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,037
How could he do that?

301
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,037
What he learns from you,
he applies to me.

302
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,320
Well, we're juniors and seniors.

303
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,440
That's true though.

304
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,400
Senior.

305
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,280
So to speak,

306
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,797
your legs are longer.

307
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,240
You're great.

308
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,157
Don't flatter me.

309
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,600
I know how long my legs are.

310
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,240
Let's get down to business.

311
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,837
Between prescribing and acupuncture
and Tuina,

312
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,240
which one do you prefer?

313
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,480
Well, it's hard for me to decide

314
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,480
because I think each has its own fun.

315
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,920
They have their good.

316
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,720
I actually like all of these.

317
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,200
Just like Ms. Dong.

318
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,077
She uses her hands
to change her patients

319
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,040
to their old self,
which is before getting the illness.

320
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,720
Don't you think it's amazing?

321
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,360
That's true though.

322
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,000
Is the strength good enough?

323
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,520
Okay.

324
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,797
-It's very good.
-Tou Tou.

325
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,397
This gentleman insists on coming to you.

326
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,320
Dr. Sun.

327
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,597
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

328
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,680
Why did you come here?

329
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,917
I went to the center.
They said you're here.

330
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,957
-So, I came here.
-Go look for Tian Zhen.

331
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,397
Let him check on you. I'm busy.

332
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,800
No, Dr. Sun, listen to me.

333
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,237
I have sleepless nights.

334
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,477
I just want to hear you talk.
Your words can make me de-stress.

335
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,597
I don't need any acupuncture treatments.

336
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,775
I want to chat with you too,
but look, I'm busy.

337
00:17:00,859 --> 00:17:02,042
Listen to me.

338
00:17:02,266 --> 00:17:03,906
I don't mind
other people listen to us, okay?

339
00:17:04,301 --> 00:17:05,858
But they don't like to listen to you.

340
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:07,877
-You...
-It's okay, Tou Tou.

341
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,960
You guys have a chat.
I'll just take a nap.

342
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:10,997
You can ignore me.

343
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,040
Look.

344
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,000
-Have a nap first.
-Sure.

345
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,920
What's wrong with you?

346
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,840
I filed for bankruptcy.

347
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,477
The bank is now taking the inventory.

348
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,920
I'll follow their instructions
on what to do next.

349
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,480
Bankrupt?

350
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,080
That means,
the tens of billions are gone.

351
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,000
Yes, they're gone.

352
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,717
You're doomed then!

353
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,277
You'll be beaten by those old men
and women when you go out!

354
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,637
Well, they don't recognize me.

355
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,240
Probably it would happen
to the celebrity who endorsed it.

356
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,800
-You're such a sinister.
-I'm not.

357
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,517
Before the celebrity was endorsed,

358
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,240
he didn't know you were a liar.

359
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,237
How could you do this?

360
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,720
My master is right.

361
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,440
Some money is not meant for us.

362
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,997
No, I'm not a liar.

363
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,757
I wanted to invest through this and
give the ordinary people a good return.

364
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,757
What did I do wrong?

365
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,280
You invested in things
that you don't know!

366
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,600
And you still have the nerve to say it!

367
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,517
When things were good, they were good.

368
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,880
But things are bad now.
Tell me, what can I do?

369
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,840
Let me tell you.

370
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,320
Things have come to this.

371
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,560
This is the bottom
of the valley, isn't it?

372
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,640
You just

373
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,680
relax and have a good sleep.

374
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,720
Well, there's another thing.

375
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,360
I feel uneasy now.

376
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,840
Why?

377
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,760
I still have a sum of money overseas.

378
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,600
Listen.

379
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,757
When the business was good,

380
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,837
I transferred some one after another.

381
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,597
I thought that if I run away,

382
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,080
at least, I still have a business.

383
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,600
I'm just not sure about
what should be done right now.

384
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,926
I can keep quiet about it.

385
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,477
But you know what?
When I close my eyes at night,

386
00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:00,037
I see all the old men and women
blocking me at the company.

387
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,877
I feel bad.

388
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,240
I can't bear the thought of it.

389
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,477
You said I fell sick
because of a guilty conscience.

390
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,000
I thought you were spot on.

391
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:10,320
You were right.

392
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,760
Tell me.

393
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,440
If I leave like this,

394
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,320
will this disease stay with me forever?

395
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,800
Lu, the bold one.

396
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,080
My master once told me this.

397
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,160
He said humans have a debt

398
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,560
which is not in the bank.

399
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,800
It's in the sky.

400
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,637
You think you've hidden the debt.

401
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,920
You think people don't know about it.

402
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,840
But this debt

403
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,720
has been following you.

404
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,120
You can't run away from it.

405
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,200
Do you know

406
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,480
the character "kui"(ashamed)?

407
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,637
It's formed from a radical heart
and the character "gui"(spirit).

408
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,200
Right? There's a spirit in your heart.

409
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,000
Someone with ulterior motives
has a grim expression.

410
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,400
He'll have a weak body,
thus suffering a lot of diseases.

411
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,720
If

412
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,240
you go abroad

413
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,280
because of the money

414
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,997
and don't return the money
to the investors,

415
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,840
then you can never come back again.

416
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,757
You will die abroad

417
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,600
and it's hard to see
your parents and friends again.

418
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,800
It'll be like this
for the rest of your life.

419
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,160
Are you willing to pay such a price

420
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,400
for this money?

421
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,600
Ask your heart.

422
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,280
Well, I'm born evil.

423
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,000
If I were to take out all my property,

424
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,320
I would feel reluctant.

425
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,800
Do you know the Yinzhi lines?

426
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,877
-Yinzhi lines.
-What lines?

427
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,680
So, when you're smiling,

428
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,680
there are three lines at this spot.

429
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,997
You have these lines.

430
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,877
-I have them?
-Yes. Just smile.

431
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,997
-Go back and look in the mirror.
-Okay.

432
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,240
These three lines.

433
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,997
Okay. So, Yinzhi lines

434
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,840
will only appear on the descendants

435
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,800
if the ancestors
have accumulated a lot of merits.

436
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,517
So, the descendants with Yinzhi lines

437
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,920
will be safe and have a smooth life.

438
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,080
That's who you are.

439
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,200
You have this

440
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,600
because your ancestors
have accumulated great merits.

441
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,997
If the ancestors don't accumulate merits
and do bad things,

442
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,600
what's on the face

443
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,440
of their descendants?

444
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,600
Disabled?

445
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,720
Something scarier?

446
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,720
Disfigured?

447
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,000
Nothing. I was just scaring you.

448
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,840
But

449
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,040
they will be cursed by all.

450
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,080
Curse and scolded by everyone.

451
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,120
It's much more serious

452
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,717
than disfigured.

453
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,397
Don't scare me, Dr. Sun.

454
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,117
Yinzhi lines and those debt things...

455
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,397
This is a modern society.

456
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,397
We don't believe
in this superstition, do we?

457
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,237
This is not a superstition.

458
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,560
It's a true belief.

459
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,840
We now have the clearest genealogy

460
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,520
of the descendants of Confucius.

461
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,720
He cultivated, preached,
and practiced virtues.

462
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,477
This is why until today,

463
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,680
many people still
go to worship him every day.

464
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,197
The Chinese used to name their children

465
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,397
with the characters
of the names of trees.

466
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,840
For example, "song"(pine),
"bai"(cypress) and "nan"(Chinese cedar).

467
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,837
But since having Qin Hui,

468
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,240
people no longer dare
to use the word "hui" (Chinese juniper)

469
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,640
in their children's names.

470
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,160
But you must know this. In the past,

471
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,720
the Chinese juniper

472
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:23,877
is as precious as the Chinese cedar.

473
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:28,117
So, do you really think that
everything you did

474
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,480
will lightly

475
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,600
be lost in time?

476
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,280
Your scoldings have woken me up.

477
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,240
I have made up my mind.

478
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,240
-You have made up your mind?
-Yes.

479
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,800
-Have you really made up your mind?
-Yes.

480
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,520
Good then.

481
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,117
Take this money out now

482
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,960
and return the money to the investors.

483
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,477
When they have peace of mind,
you will have peace of mind.

484
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,920
When they have peace of mind,

485
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,200
you can fall asleep.

486
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,800
I can fall asleep.

487
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:04,880
Yes.

488
00:23:05,266 --> 00:23:06,277
Today, I...

489
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,880
Luckily I came to you.

490
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,160
What you said has opened up my mind.

491
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,240
I'll go and get it done now.

492
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,720
Go now.

493
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,720
-I'll go and do it now.
-Hurry up.

494
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,640
I'll go and do it now.

495
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,920
You're born kind, you know.

496
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,040
Very kind.

497
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,237
Someone is still lying here.

498
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,120
Senior.

499
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,000
Gosh.

500
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,517
I've totally forgotten about you.

501
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,960
How could you forget about
this huge living thing here!

502
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,517
Listen, I forgot about you, really.

503
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,520
I forgot about you.

504
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,837
You know.

505
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,360
Tou Tou, you said it so well.

506
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:44,240
Today, I've learned something as well.

507
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,397
You've progressed a lot.
You blew me away.

508
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,757
You're great.

509
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,640
Really?

510
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,280
Yes.

511
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,560
Is this strength good enough?

512
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:54,997
Very good.

513
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,560
You're becoming more skillful.

514
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,477
Well, remember to praise me
in front of Ms. Dong then.

515
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,840
Don't worry. I'll handle this.

516
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:02,880
Okay.

517
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,120
You're here for Tuina again?

518
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,480
Why didn't you ask for Ms. Dong?

519
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,920
Well,

520
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,920
just keep Ms. Dong to yourself.

521
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,997
You two are like god versus god.

522
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,200
It's better for me to get Sun Tou Tou.

523
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,960
But she hasn't passed the exam.

524
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,320
Let me tell you.

525
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,320
Tuina

526
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,080
is very profound.

527
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,480
It's about getting along well.

528
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,200
Tou Tou gets along well with me.

529
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,960
I tried Tuina from
all the physicians here.

530
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,757
I still think Tou Tou is the best.

531
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:56,800
You know, she is very talented.

532
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,800
Shan Dao.

533
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,480
I've been thinking about the bloodline.

534
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,960
When she first came, Sun Tou Tou

535
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,480
was just a crazy girl.

536
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,320
But look at her now.

537
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,397
She looks like an inheritor now.

538
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,720
She looks so real.

539
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,480
When you first brought her here,

540
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,600
I was

541
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,560
just following Master's instructions.

542
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,080
But you

543
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,600
have accepted her, aren't you?

544
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,440
I've been spending my whole life

545
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,680
cultivating discipleship.

546
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,320
After all these years of cultivation,
I realized these two words.

547
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:46,800
Which two words?

548
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,000
"Don't disobey."

549
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,720
I did whatever Master told me to do.

550
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,840
You know what? I didn't expect that

551
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,840
after all the teachings,

552
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,440
I turned a monkey into a practitioner.

553
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,240
A good disciple like the one you have,

554
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,560
there'll be none in the future.

555
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,240
They will be extinct.

556
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,480
Which of the kids nowadays

557
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,640
can do this?

558
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,600
Don't disobey.

559
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,640
Let's see if Tou Tou can do it.

560
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,240
If she can do this,

561
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,800
that means her apprenticeship
has come to an end.

562
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,920
I can then hand over my job.

563
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:33,880
Your words make a lot of sense.

564
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,117
Such a huge cordyceps.

565
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,517
We have kept it for years.

566
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,200
-What is this?
-Lingzhi.

567
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,520
And the deer penis.

568
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,720
I saw that before.

569
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,080
Master!

570
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,880
Master!

571
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,760
Senior, please come in.

572
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,360
Prof. Ren

573
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,639
Mrs. Zhu.

574
00:26:51,546 --> 00:26:52,439
Mrs. Zhu.

575
00:26:52,523 --> 00:26:53,893
Hello, Mrs. Zhu.
I'm Mr. Wu, the principal.

576
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,680
-Hello, Mr. Wu.
-Hello.

577
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,000
Look.

578
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,720
These are all Zhu's wishes.

579
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,397
He hoarded these treasures

580
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,000
but they're useless now.

581
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,600
So, I brought them for you.

582
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,000
Look at this.

583
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,000
It's 70-year-old wild ginseng.

584
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,440
The root is still intact.

585
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,080
Those two

586
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,517
are the 60-year-old tangerine peel.

587
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,600
I heard that
it's more expensive than gold.

588
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,600
And this.

589
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,877
I think he said it is

590
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,680
the deer musk
produced at high latitudes.

591
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,880
They were
all kept in a safe all the time.

592
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,037
And this cordyceps.

593
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,400
I brought everything here.

594
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,560
Please keep them.

595
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,640
All of these are expensive.

596
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,080
I don't know these things

597
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,600
and I don't know how to use them either.

598
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,440
Zhu said

599
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,237
Prof. Ren can use them

600
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,440
on the one who really needs it.

601
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,560
So, please keep them.

602
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,320
Let's keep them then.

603
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:12,920
Thank you.

604
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,240
Tou Tou.

605
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,960
Carefully record everything

606
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,000
-and send it to the medical center.
-Okay.

607
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,280
Prof. Ren.

608
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:26,720
And this.

609
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,560
The donation from Zhu
to the apprentice class.

610
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,320
When he was conscious,
he specifically told me that

611
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,120
Prof. Ren

612
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,597
could even educate a kid like Tou Tou.

613
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,240
The merits of
the apprentice class were immeasurable.

614
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,600
He also said that

615
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,400
our family will be entrusted
to the medical center in the future.

616
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,440
How can I not donate some?

617
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,960
Well, that...

618
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,120
Zhu was

619
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:07,717
complimenting or scolding me?

620
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,960
-Why do I feel that...
-He was praising you.

621
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,680
Mrs. Zhu.

622
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,960
I understand

623
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,200
what Zhu said.

624
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,120
Thank you.

625
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,280
Thank you.

626
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,440
Li Quan.

627
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,080
You're not working today?

628
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,520
Mr. Wu.

629
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,720
Today, I come here to work.

630
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,360
Anything?

631
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,840
I heard Mr. Tu say

632
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,600
you're applying to become a full-time.

633
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,360
But I have one piece of advice.

634
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:00,080
I hope you won't become
a full-time medical sales agent.

635
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:03,920
You have to make time for studying.

636
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,480
I believe in you.

637
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,837
I hope you too

638
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,600
can become a great doctor in the future.

639
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,960
You know, a swamp won't be able
to restrain a roc bird with its dream.

640
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,760
That's right.

641
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,157
Mr. Wu, recently, my company

642
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,640
has just gotten the approval
for a batch of medicines.

643
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,040
We hope
the tertiary hospitals can use them.

644
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,000
The tender is coming up.

645
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,637
I don't quite understand the process,

646
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,360
so I hope you can have a look.

647
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,920
Good.

648
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,960
Tu asked you to come, right?

649
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,240
Do you know what you are doing?

650
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,720
A scholar

651
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,560
should not be impulsive

652
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,080
let alone go with the flow.

653
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,480
Let's rest the matter here.

654
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,440
I'll pretend you haven't been here.

655
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,840
Mr. Wu, don't worry.

656
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,997
This card is in my name.
It has nothing to do with you.

657
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,520
You just need to spend it.

658
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,080
We are only...

659
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,640
Kid.

660
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,520
Do you know why I wanted to help you?

661
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,160
That's because you are kind.

662
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,597
You help the poor and the weak.

663
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,240
Enough, enough.
I don't want to hear this.

664
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,360
Society is very complicated.

665
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,320
One must learn to hold oneself.

666
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:07,000
You must know what to do
and what not to do.

667
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,120
You must keep it in mind.

668
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,200
But Mr. Wu,

669
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,200
I know you've been good to me.

670
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,960
I won't harm you.

671
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,757
We've gone through
the medicine countless times.

672
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,237
It absolutely has no quality issue.

673
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,280
Li Quan.

674
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,440
I recommended you work there

675
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,440
as a part-time medical sales agent

676
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,840
because I want you
to study medicine well.

677
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,120
But

678
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,080
when I went for a Tuina recently,

679
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,320
you were not there.

680
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,680
When I went to the medical center,

681
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,800
you weren't there either.

682
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,680
I just want to ask you this.

683
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,120
Do you still want to be a doctor?

684
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,720
I want.

685
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,520
But I don't have
the identity like Tou Tou

686
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,480
nor a background like Tian Zhen.

687
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,040
I still have a family
waiting for me to help.

688
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,397
I have a dream,

689
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,680
but I don't have the capital
to realize my dream.

690
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,600
I know you'll be very disappointed in me

691
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,920
when I say that.

692
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,560
Actually, I am

693
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,200
disappointed in myself too.

694
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,800
But Mr. Wu,

695
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,440
for the children
from poor families like us

696
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,517
to prove ourselves in society...

697
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,040
Don't keep using poverty as an excuse

698
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,800
and justify your laziness.

699
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,917
Many people in this world

700
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,240
went through poverty.

701
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,920
Take me for example.

702
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:46,517
Back then, my family background
was almost the same as yours.

703
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,720
And Prof. Ren.

704
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,200
His family was extremely poor.

705
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,560
But right now...

706
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,840
We may not be some influential people,

707
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,520
but you can consider us
as pillars of strength.

708
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:05,120
You must pursue your goal

709
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,560
and be practical.

710
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,240
You can't be opportunistic.

711
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,240
These are all that I want to tell you.

712
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,640
Go back and think about it.

713
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,240
This...

714
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,080
Take it away.

715
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,840
Tell Tu

716
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,240
not to do this with me.

717
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,600
Otherwise,

718
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,560
I'll go find President Zheng.

719
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,597
Well, we can't say that
we shouldn't get married

720
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,957
if we can't afford to buy a house,

721
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,997
or don't get a baby
if we don't stay near the school.

722
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,637
I don't know what other people think,

723
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,280
but this is what I think.

724
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,237
I think if having a partner

725
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,200
is more tiresome than being alone,

726
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,600
I'd rather be single.

727
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,197
Love can't feed you.

728
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,957
I'm facing
the hardships of this city now.

729
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,520
I don't want my kids to lose

730
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:44,800
from the moment he is born.

731
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,720
You're just a messenger for us.

732
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,440
If he is okay,

733
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,720
then everyone will be happy.

734
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,320
If he's not okay,

735
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,560
you just return the card to me.

736
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,800
This has nothing to do with you.

737
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,542
But

738
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,760
if you manage to do this,

739
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,280
the sales from the hospitals,

740
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,120
I'll give you one point.

741
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,960
As for how much this one point is,

742
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:32,880
I guess you don't need me
to calculate for you, right?

743
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:49,880
Hello, Mom.

744
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,160
We're home.

745
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:04,880
Where is everybody?

746
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:06,600
I guess they've gone out.

747
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,280
Why did they go out at this hour?

748
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,320
Perhaps to take a walk.

749
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:18,677
Let's go.

750
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,560
Okay.

751
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,397
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

752
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,198
You've scared me.

753
00:37:24,281 --> 00:37:25,960
♫ To you ♫

754
00:37:26,396 --> 00:37:29,836
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

755
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,520
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

756
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,000
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

757
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,553
Wait! Whose birthday is it?

758
00:37:41,637 --> 00:37:43,677
We sang the song
yet you still don't know?

759
00:37:44,073 --> 00:37:45,873
It's your birthday.

760
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,800
Me?

761
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,800
Mom, Dad, have a seat.

762
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,360
Quan.

763
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,720
Why are you living alone now?

764
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,877
I used to share with a girl.

765
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,520
But it was inconvenient,
so, I moved out.

766
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,197
Was it the girl you like?

767
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,520
No, Mom.
I don't have a girl that I like.

768
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,437
You told me during Chinese New Year.

769
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,880
Don't talk about that useless thing.

770
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,000
Talk about the fish pond.

771
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,400
Fish pond?

772
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,160
What's wrong with the fish pond?

773
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,600
Quan.

774
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,040
It's haunted.

775
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,480
The fish pond at our house

776
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,080
have had three cars went into in

777
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,240
within two months.

778
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:42,117
We've been doing
fish farming for three to five years,

779
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:45,120
but we've never encountered
such a wicked thing.

780
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,757
Three incidents in a row?

781
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,720
That's right.

782
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,080
The drivers were rescued,

783
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,197
but the cars have ruined the fish pond.

784
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,037
The pond is filled with engine oil,

785
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,280
so the oil stains float on the water.

786
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,360
All the fishes are dead.

787
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,520
When the first car plunged in,

788
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,920
it was so scary.

789
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,600
The driver almost died.

790
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,120
Luckily,
your brother was quick to respond.

791
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,560
He jumped into the pond with a wrench

792
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,477
and dragged the driver out

793
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,880
by smashing the windscreen.

794
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,320
Otherwise,

795
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,600
the car and the driver

796
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,000
would...

797
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,117
Is my brother okay?

798
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,440
What could have happened to him?

799
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,837
There is no way to farm the fish now.

800
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,837
We need at least a few years

801
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,357
to get rid of all the leftover oil.

802
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:31,280
Otherwise, the fish will have
the smell of the engine oil.

803
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,520
This pond is completely ruined.

804
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,040
Did they drink and drive?

805
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,880
They have to compensate, Dad.

806
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,720
Have you asked
for the village head's help?

807
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,920
Yes, but we didn't get it.

808
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,760
Why?

809
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,600
The drivers sued us first.

810
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,200
They said there were

811
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,000
no warning signs at night
at the fish pond.

812
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,680
They couldn't see anything.

813
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,806
Well,

814
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,597
the birth date
on my ID card isn't today.

815
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,040
You got it wrong.

816
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:09,240
Well, I said it's your birthday,
so it's your birthday.

817
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:10,717
Master.

818
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,240
Do you have a craving for alcohol?

819
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,197
You force her to celebrate a birthday.

820
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,280
You can't say that to your master.

821
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,720
Well, Tou Tou

822
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,837
have been here for some time.

823
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,520
But we've never
celebrated birthday for her.

824
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,840
We've got to give her a birthday.

825
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,280
Humans must have a sense of ritual.

826
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,520
They should at least know

827
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,517
who are they and where they come from,

828
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,957
and where are they heading to, right?

829
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,880
Right now, I don't need to know

830
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,280
where I come from,

831
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,957
because I really don't know

832
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,680
when was I born.

833
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,760
But right now, I

834
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,280
know exactly where I'm heading to.

835
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,400
Where are you heading to?

836
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:50,213
I will work hard

837
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,573
and be the inheritor.

838
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,317
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

839
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,637

traditional Chinese medicine books)
