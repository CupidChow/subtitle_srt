00:01:30,567 --> 00:01:34,504
(Gen Z)

2
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,961
(Episode 17)

3
00:01:40,188 --> 00:01:41,429
You still have to pass on

4
00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:42,429
your family's legacy.

5
00:01:42,909 --> 00:01:43,789
Are you going

6
00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:44,789
to ignore your elders?

7
00:01:47,268 --> 00:01:48,108
That won't be the case.

8
00:01:48,949 --> 00:01:50,268
You don't understand my mother.

9
00:01:50,428 --> 00:01:51,468
My mother won't fall out with me.

10
00:01:52,109 --> 00:01:53,109
This problem will be resolved

11
00:01:53,308 --> 00:01:55,308
after some time.

12
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:02,829
Don't tell me

13
00:02:02,829 --> 00:02:03,948
you fell for Meng Meng?

14
00:02:04,868 --> 00:02:05,708
What nonsense are you saying?

15
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,108
I think you and your father

16
00:02:10,108 --> 00:02:11,829
don't love Niece-in-law at all.

17
00:02:13,108 --> 00:02:14,468
She's the one providing you two
with all her love.

18
00:02:14,788 --> 00:02:15,869
You two are ingrates.

19
00:02:16,509 --> 00:02:17,709
Don't try to drive a wedge between us.

20
00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:19,108
Who says I don't love my mother?

21
00:02:19,108 --> 00:02:20,108
I'm not driving a wedge between you two.

22
00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:21,549
I'm motherless.

23
00:02:21,588 --> 00:02:22,468
If I did have a mother,

24
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:24,069
I wouldn't make her upset
for other people's sake.

25
00:02:28,108 --> 00:02:28,908
If I were her,

26
00:02:28,908 --> 00:02:29,765
I would've given birth to another child.

27
00:02:30,788 --> 00:02:32,308
I'll sever my ties with
an ingrate like you.

28
00:02:35,669 --> 00:02:36,788
Let me tell you something.

29
00:02:36,788 --> 00:02:37,628
You have no idea.

30
00:02:38,509 --> 00:02:39,908
My mother loves me

31
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:42,109
the most.

32
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:43,109
I know that.

33
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:48,494
Wait.

34
00:02:49,029 --> 00:02:50,188
What should I do

35
00:02:50,588 --> 00:02:51,548
if you guys leave now?

36
00:02:52,548 --> 00:02:54,188
What has my departure
got to do with you?

37
00:02:54,349 --> 00:02:55,188
Once you leave,

38
00:02:55,188 --> 00:02:56,429
the four elders will keep an eye on me

39
00:02:56,469 --> 00:02:58,109
constantly.

40
00:02:58,188 --> 00:02:59,268
How could I lead a carefree life then?

41
00:03:00,188 --> 00:03:01,828
If so, you should cherish the time

42
00:03:01,828 --> 00:03:02,948
when I can still help you

43
00:03:02,948 --> 00:03:04,029
to distract them.

44
00:03:04,548 --> 00:03:05,429
But it'll end soon.

45
00:03:07,188 --> 00:03:08,469
Wait, can you please don't leave?

46
00:03:09,268 --> 00:03:10,156
You don't get to decide that.

47
00:03:14,268 --> 00:03:15,220
You ingrate.

48
00:03:19,188 --> 00:03:20,628
Ren Tian Zhen, you're an ingrate.

49
00:03:22,029 --> 00:03:22,548
I'm serious.

50
00:03:23,389 --> 00:03:24,188
You're a total ingrate.

51
00:03:27,588 --> 00:03:28,448
Your mother is here.

52
00:03:42,669 --> 00:03:43,468
Ren Tian Zhen,

53
00:03:45,108 --> 00:03:46,108
I'm your mother.

54
00:03:46,828 --> 00:03:48,589
Do you truly intend to
go against your mother

55
00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:50,589
because of Meng Meng?

56
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:52,309
I'm your son.

57
00:03:52,309 --> 00:03:54,388
However, Meng Meng is my patient too.

58
00:03:54,908 --> 00:03:57,548
You're an adult with
a healthy state of mind.

59
00:03:57,668 --> 00:03:58,628
But she's not.

60
00:03:58,628 --> 00:04:00,188
Since I have to choose between you two,

61
00:04:00,188 --> 00:04:01,468
of course I'll choose her.

62
00:04:02,028 --> 00:04:03,789
It's precisely because
she's your patient

63
00:04:04,349 --> 00:04:05,269
that you shouldn't

64
00:04:05,748 --> 00:04:06,668
be nice to her

65
00:04:07,628 --> 00:04:08,748
with any ulterior motives

66
00:04:08,869 --> 00:04:10,429
when it comes to both
private and public affairs.

67
00:04:10,628 --> 00:04:11,628
That's the rule.

68
00:04:11,828 --> 00:04:13,108
If I do get together with her,

69
00:04:13,108 --> 00:04:14,429
I'm sure her parents will be elated.

70
00:04:14,548 --> 00:04:15,709
I'm sure they'll leave her

71
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:16,668
to me.

72
00:04:16,668 --> 00:04:17,525
You!

73
00:04:23,069 --> 00:04:24,429
Tell me. Even since you were born,

74
00:04:24,709 --> 00:04:25,589
have I ever made you

75
00:04:26,388 --> 00:04:27,709
endure any hardships?

76
00:04:28,149 --> 00:04:28,989
Didn't I provide you

77
00:04:28,989 --> 00:04:30,149
with all the freedom you want?

78
00:04:31,989 --> 00:04:33,989
However, you need to obey me

79
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:35,388
when it comes to choosing
your girlfriend.

80
00:04:36,028 --> 00:04:37,028
Mum, don't forget.

81
00:04:38,188 --> 00:04:39,908
Your scope of power

82
00:04:40,108 --> 00:04:41,188
only extends from you

83
00:04:41,468 --> 00:04:43,709
to Dad.

84
00:04:43,869 --> 00:04:44,742
Please do not cross the line.

85
00:04:51,989 --> 00:04:52,830
That's right.

86
00:04:53,028 --> 00:04:53,909
You guys have to stay under

87
00:04:54,028 --> 00:04:56,149
my scope of power.

88
00:04:59,149 --> 00:05:00,309
Meng Meng can stay.

89
00:05:00,548 --> 00:05:01,989
-Can she?
-Of course.

90
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:04,149
I can only rest at ease when you two

91
00:05:04,149 --> 00:05:05,149
are under my nose.

92
00:05:06,108 --> 00:05:07,004
Mum,

93
00:05:07,108 --> 00:05:09,468
you're still the head of the family.

94
00:05:10,028 --> 00:05:10,972
I'm glad you understand.

95
00:05:12,028 --> 00:05:12,893
Take care.

96
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:24,517
Hello?

97
00:05:24,548 --> 00:05:25,388
Hello.

98
00:05:25,668 --> 00:05:26,709
I contacted you

99
00:05:26,709 --> 00:05:27,668
to rent a unit before this.

100
00:05:28,709 --> 00:05:29,989
I don't need it for now.

101
00:05:29,989 --> 00:05:31,429
Thank you. Sorry for the trouble.

102
00:05:31,429 --> 00:05:32,227
Sorry about that.

103
00:05:32,908 --> 00:05:33,754
Okay.

104
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,957
This is great.

105
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:49,245
(First Frost is the last
solar term of autumn)

106
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:54,498
(and it signals
the beginning of winter.)

107
00:05:54,838 --> 00:05:57,600
(As a folk saying goes,)

108
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,320
(nourishing your body
during First Frost is important.)

109
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,320
(First Frost)

110
00:06:37,309 --> 00:06:38,508
Are you okay? The car is pretty shaky.

111
00:07:00,189 --> 00:07:01,709
Did you guys see that?

112
00:07:08,869 --> 00:07:09,694
Master,

113
00:07:11,149 --> 00:07:12,268
I thought we were going to provide
free medical consultation?

114
00:07:12,268 --> 00:07:13,469
Why are we entering the mountains again?

115
00:07:14,709 --> 00:07:15,828
Aconite

116
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:18,589
sprouts before Minor Snow.

117
00:07:18,589 --> 00:07:19,869
That's why we have to check out

118
00:07:19,869 --> 00:07:22,228
the sprouts of aconite

119
00:07:22,388 --> 00:07:23,348
before providing the service.

120
00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:27,828
Earthquake affects
the harvest of aconite severely.

121
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:28,909
That's why we'll come here

122
00:07:28,909 --> 00:07:30,989
every year whenever it's time
to plant them.

123
00:07:30,989 --> 00:07:32,348
This year is pretty good.

124
00:07:32,828 --> 00:07:34,548
The aconite they sent
to our medical centre

125
00:07:34,548 --> 00:07:35,709
are abundant in both quality
and quantity.

126
00:07:40,989 --> 00:07:41,846
Do you feel sick?

127
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,206
Grandson,

128
00:07:45,309 --> 00:07:46,388
drive slower.

129
00:07:46,388 --> 00:07:47,309
The road is bumpy.

130
00:07:47,309 --> 00:07:48,589
Look at how you're driving.

131
00:07:48,589 --> 00:07:49,989
Meng Meng is going to throw up soon.

132
00:07:50,668 --> 00:07:51,668
I don't want this to happen too.

133
00:07:51,749 --> 00:07:53,068
But we have to hike today.

134
00:07:53,149 --> 00:07:53,989
If we don't hurry,

135
00:07:53,989 --> 00:07:55,029
we can't reach before dusk.

136
00:07:55,149 --> 00:07:55,976
Wait.

137
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,243
But she...

138
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,108
I'm sitting beside her.

139
00:07:58,108 --> 00:07:59,749
What if she throws up and I'm affected?

140
00:08:00,149 --> 00:08:01,309
There's a plastic bag there.

141
00:08:02,388 --> 00:08:03,989
Meng Meng, hang in there.

142
00:08:12,348 --> 00:08:13,869
The older the wiser indeed.

143
00:08:14,429 --> 00:08:15,869
Look at Master and Madam.

144
00:08:16,388 --> 00:08:17,469
They feel nothing at all.

145
00:08:18,388 --> 00:08:20,029
Look, Madam is even closing her eyes.

146
00:08:20,108 --> 00:08:20,975
She looks like she's enjoying the ride.

147
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:22,068
This is nothing.

148
00:08:23,108 --> 00:08:24,948
I've travelled to all kinds of places

149
00:08:24,989 --> 00:08:25,989
together with your master.

150
00:08:26,108 --> 00:08:27,309
I've endured all kinds of hardships.

151
00:08:28,989 --> 00:08:31,029
There was a time when I couldn't
take a bath for an entire month.

152
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:33,629
Why are you so proud of that?

153
00:09:08,068 --> 00:09:09,228
Stop patting your leg.

154
00:09:09,228 --> 00:09:10,189
You'll throw up.

155
00:09:10,294 --> 00:09:11,287
(Gen Z)

156
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,568
(Starry Sky)

157
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,000
(Starry Sky)

158
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,513
(Starry Sky)

159
00:10:22,749 --> 00:10:24,189
Thank you for helping us out.

160
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,198
Are you exhausted?

161
00:10:44,989 --> 00:10:46,028
If so, we can take a break.

162
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:47,098
Okay.

163
00:10:50,228 --> 00:10:51,749
I didn't expect you to like that song.

164
00:10:51,908 --> 00:10:52,788
It wasn't your style.

165
00:10:56,548 --> 00:10:57,989
I was always full of energy

166
00:10:57,989 --> 00:10:58,989
when I was staying in the orphanage.

167
00:10:58,989 --> 00:10:59,869
I wasn't willing to sleep.

168
00:11:00,509 --> 00:11:01,389
After that,

169
00:11:01,949 --> 00:11:03,069
the caretaker

170
00:11:03,189 --> 00:11:04,069
carried me.

171
00:11:04,548 --> 00:11:06,148
I leaned my head against her shoulder.

172
00:11:06,869 --> 00:11:07,949
She sang while taking a walk

173
00:11:08,189 --> 00:11:09,148
in the courtyard.

174
00:11:09,148 --> 00:11:10,069
That's how I was able to fall asleep.

175
00:11:10,548 --> 00:11:12,069
I became an orphan due to the flood.

176
00:11:13,108 --> 00:11:15,028
I have no impression
of my mother whatsoever.

177
00:11:15,749 --> 00:11:16,677
However,

178
00:11:17,629 --> 00:11:18,629
whenever I hear this song,

179
00:11:18,629 --> 00:11:19,629
I'll be reminded of

180
00:11:21,069 --> 00:11:22,989
the moment when I leaned
my head against her shoulder.

181
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:25,429
That was probably my only impression

182
00:11:25,429 --> 00:11:26,348
of my mother.

183
00:11:45,108 --> 00:11:46,468
We need to hike that hill, right?

184
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,484
We're almost there.

185
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:48,629
We'll reach there
after crossing this hill.

186
00:11:48,629 --> 00:11:49,749
But we just crossed one.

187
00:11:50,069 --> 00:11:50,903
That's right.

188
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:14,888
Descend diagonally.

189
00:12:14,949 --> 00:12:15,734
Mr Ren,

190
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:17,309
how far away are we from
the aconite field?

191
00:12:17,788 --> 00:12:18,661
It's nearby.

192
00:12:18,788 --> 00:12:20,629
We'll reach it after crossing this hill.

193
00:12:21,189 --> 00:12:22,260
It's nearby.

194
00:12:23,629 --> 00:12:24,668
We're not there yet?

195
00:12:25,189 --> 00:12:26,429
Charge!

196
00:12:27,668 --> 00:12:29,069
Charge!

197
00:12:29,108 --> 00:12:30,908
-Be careful!
-Charge!

198
00:12:36,228 --> 00:12:37,389
You'll fall, you know?

199
00:13:12,949 --> 00:13:14,309
Have you brewed it for four hours?

200
00:13:14,788 --> 00:13:16,548
I started brewing it after

201
00:13:16,548 --> 00:13:17,509
you started to hike the mountain.

202
00:13:17,509 --> 00:13:19,069
It's been over five hours.

203
00:13:19,189 --> 00:13:20,228
Are you sure the fire was always there?

204
00:13:20,228 --> 00:13:21,348
Yes.

205
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:23,509
Let's dig in.

206
00:13:23,989 --> 00:13:24,882
Let's dig in!

207
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:35,108
Do you guys know

208
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,468
what's the most important element

209
00:13:36,629 --> 00:13:37,429
of this dish?

210
00:13:38,869 --> 00:13:40,509
The most important element

211
00:13:40,548 --> 00:13:43,429
is that it must be cooked
for over four hours

212
00:13:43,749 --> 00:13:45,429
without stopping the heat.

213
00:13:47,588 --> 00:13:49,309
Are you referring to this chicken soup?

214
00:13:50,108 --> 00:13:50,973
That's right.

215
00:13:51,949 --> 00:13:52,989
This soup

216
00:13:52,989 --> 00:13:53,869
contains aconite.

217
00:13:54,309 --> 00:13:56,389
Aconite contains Aconitine.

218
00:13:57,189 --> 00:13:58,749
Aconitine is poisonous.

219
00:13:58,869 --> 00:14:00,629
We have to neutralize the poison

220
00:14:01,189 --> 00:14:02,348
for aconite

221
00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:03,509
to be effective.

222
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:05,404
Mister,

223
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:07,028
can you tell us earlier next time?

224
00:14:07,148 --> 00:14:08,788
I've already finished the chicken feet.

225
00:14:08,989 --> 00:14:10,429
Don't you think it's too late
to tell us about that?

226
00:14:10,429 --> 00:14:11,908
What if we get poisoned

227
00:14:11,989 --> 00:14:12,908
and die?

228
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,563
I already took it.

229
00:14:14,588 --> 00:14:15,509
Everyone else took it too.

230
00:14:15,509 --> 00:14:16,749
What are you afraid of?

231
00:14:16,869 --> 00:14:18,908
Do you think your life
is more precious than the others?

232
00:14:18,989 --> 00:14:20,949
That's not it.
Both of us are successors.

233
00:14:21,429 --> 00:14:23,189
We have a heavy burden on our shoulders.

234
00:14:23,348 --> 00:14:25,028
We cannot live for our sake.

235
00:14:25,108 --> 00:14:26,189
Many people are waiting for us

236
00:14:26,189 --> 00:14:27,309
to contribute to the world.

237
00:14:27,869 --> 00:14:28,949
I'll skip it. Here.

238
00:14:28,989 --> 00:14:30,108
You guys can go ahead.

239
00:14:30,309 --> 00:14:31,548
Tou Tou, don't worry.

240
00:14:31,548 --> 00:14:32,668
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

241
00:14:32,668 --> 00:14:33,548
I made this soup

242
00:14:33,749 --> 00:14:34,749
under your master's

243
00:14:34,788 --> 00:14:36,228
guidance.

244
00:14:36,348 --> 00:14:37,228
Don't worry.

245
00:14:37,989 --> 00:14:38,989
Professor Ren

246
00:14:39,108 --> 00:14:40,228
is a kind Samaritan.

247
00:14:40,749 --> 00:14:42,108
We, the Poverty Alleviation Office,

248
00:14:42,189 --> 00:14:43,429
invited him personally

249
00:14:43,429 --> 00:14:44,468
to help us

250
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:45,588
assess the fields,

251
00:14:45,668 --> 00:14:46,629
observe the weather,

252
00:14:46,668 --> 00:14:47,989
and guide us to plant

253
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,280
aconite, Gastrodia elata
and Solomon's seal.

254
00:14:52,228 --> 00:14:53,148
You guys saw

255
00:14:53,389 --> 00:14:54,668
our village yourselves.

256
00:14:55,069 --> 00:14:56,629
We're hidden deep in the mountains.

257
00:14:56,949 --> 00:14:58,028
It's a remote place

258
00:14:58,028 --> 00:14:59,309
with no resources.

259
00:14:59,629 --> 00:15:01,309
It's inconvenient
for us to enter or exit the place.

260
00:15:02,108 --> 00:15:03,069
But now, it's much better.

261
00:15:03,429 --> 00:15:04,629
When Professor Ren is here,

262
00:15:04,949 --> 00:15:06,429
we could plant and harvest herbs.

263
00:15:07,548 --> 00:15:08,548
We got a job

264
00:15:08,548 --> 00:15:10,189
because of him.

265
00:15:11,949 --> 00:15:13,429
Aconite is poisonous when
it hasn't been processed.

266
00:15:14,189 --> 00:15:16,389
We must promote such knowledge
and make it common sense

267
00:15:16,509 --> 00:15:18,108
so that people can know about it.

268
00:15:18,989 --> 00:15:19,668
You see...

269
00:15:19,869 --> 00:15:20,429
This is delicious.

270
00:15:20,429 --> 00:15:21,989
We grow them

271
00:15:23,069 --> 00:15:23,949
without any pesticides.

272
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:25,189
We use organic fertilizers
to plant them.

273
00:15:26,108 --> 00:15:26,749
Only then,

274
00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:28,548
the herbs can be of excellent quality.

275
00:15:28,829 --> 00:15:30,629
If the herbs we used in Chinese medicine
aren't of the best quality,

276
00:15:31,788 --> 00:15:33,269
the TCM field will be done for.

277
00:15:33,749 --> 00:15:35,028
Don't worry, Professor Ren.

278
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:36,869
We did everything

279
00:15:36,989 --> 00:15:37,949
according to your guidance.

280
00:15:38,829 --> 00:15:40,548
We didn't dare to slack off.

281
00:15:40,949 --> 00:15:41,844
What do you mean?

282
00:15:41,869 --> 00:15:43,629
Are you saying that
you can do e-commerce

283
00:15:43,629 --> 00:15:44,605
in an isolated place like this?

284
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,348
We have to thank Professor Ren for that.

285
00:15:47,588 --> 00:15:49,108
After Professor Ren came here,

286
00:15:49,389 --> 00:15:50,189
he discovered

287
00:15:50,429 --> 00:15:52,989
that our village is suitable
for growing aconite.

288
00:15:53,108 --> 00:15:54,548
He chose the field for us.

289
00:15:54,981 --> 00:15:55,941
He taught us

290
00:15:56,148 --> 00:15:57,348
how to grow them.

291
00:15:57,509 --> 00:15:59,069
He even contacted online retailers

292
00:15:59,309 --> 00:16:00,108
and advertised for us.

293
00:16:00,548 --> 00:16:02,749
You guys may not believe it,

294
00:16:03,108 --> 00:16:05,429
but many foreigners come here

295
00:16:05,588 --> 00:16:07,309
to purchase herbs from us.

296
00:16:07,468 --> 00:16:10,189
We grow our crops with
all of our hearts.

297
00:16:11,108 --> 00:16:13,309
As long as we ensure the quality
of the herbs,

298
00:16:13,309 --> 00:16:14,869
you guys will render merit as well

299
00:16:14,869 --> 00:16:16,348
when we cure other people
with the herbs you grow.

300
00:16:17,989 --> 00:16:18,989
Our entire village

301
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:21,228
is very thankful to Professor Ren.

302
00:16:21,309 --> 00:16:22,228
Ever since

303
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:24,309
we started growing them,

304
00:16:24,788 --> 00:16:25,707
each family

305
00:16:26,108 --> 00:16:27,108
has a job to do.

306
00:16:27,108 --> 00:16:28,108
Now, we get paid.

307
00:16:28,108 --> 00:16:30,028
In the past,

308
00:16:30,069 --> 00:16:32,788
only kids and elderly people
stayed here.

309
00:16:32,788 --> 00:16:33,668
All youngsters

310
00:16:33,989 --> 00:16:35,429
would work in the city.

311
00:16:36,509 --> 00:16:39,389
But now, our village is making
good income.

312
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:42,509
The youngsters came back.

313
00:16:42,548 --> 00:16:43,389
The kids here

314
00:16:43,949 --> 00:16:45,629
can finally spend time
with their parents.

315
00:16:46,509 --> 00:16:47,309
It's just like

316
00:16:47,309 --> 00:16:48,708
what Professor Ren had said.

317
00:16:49,069 --> 00:16:50,949
When you teach a man how to fish...

318
00:16:51,108 --> 00:16:52,629
What was it again?

319
00:16:53,949 --> 00:16:55,189
Better to teach someone to fish

320
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:57,189
than to give him a fish.

321
00:16:57,228 --> 00:16:58,949
That's right. That's what I meant.

322
00:16:59,108 --> 00:17:00,908
Anyway, Professor Ren

323
00:17:00,908 --> 00:17:02,429
made us rich.

324
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:04,965
Come.

325
00:17:05,309 --> 00:17:06,269
Let's have a toast

326
00:17:06,668 --> 00:17:08,108
with the chicken soup.

327
00:17:08,309 --> 00:17:09,108
-Come.
-Come.

328
00:17:09,108 --> 00:17:10,389
-Thank you.
-Thank you, Professor Ren.

329
00:17:10,389 --> 00:17:11,708
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

330
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:12,545
Thank you.

331
00:17:22,749 --> 00:17:23,788
Has everything been arranged for?

332
00:17:23,989 --> 00:17:24,868
Don't worry.

333
00:17:26,548 --> 00:17:27,468
Do you need any help?

334
00:17:27,509 --> 00:17:28,357
Nope!

335
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:36,148
Hello.

336
00:17:37,269 --> 00:17:38,108
Professor Song.

337
00:17:38,108 --> 00:17:39,788
Welcome.

338
00:17:40,548 --> 00:17:42,708
Sir, thank you

339
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:44,148
for your arrangement.

340
00:17:44,269 --> 00:17:46,148
You guys are here to provide us
with free training

341
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,509
and medical consultation.

342
00:17:47,509 --> 00:17:48,668
You guys are even donating to us.

343
00:17:48,668 --> 00:17:50,269
We should be the ones
thanking you guys instead.

344
00:17:50,509 --> 00:17:51,708
It's our job.

345
00:17:52,028 --> 00:17:53,108
So, are the teaching assistants

346
00:17:53,108 --> 00:17:54,028
the village doctors

347
00:17:54,028 --> 00:17:55,028
we trained last time?

348
00:17:55,269 --> 00:17:56,157
Not just them.

349
00:17:56,269 --> 00:17:57,749
The village doctors from other villages

350
00:17:57,749 --> 00:17:59,148
wish to attend this training too.

351
00:17:59,389 --> 00:18:01,269
We didn't agree to it
as we thought it might be

352
00:18:01,269 --> 00:18:02,148
too taxing on you two.

353
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:03,269
That's fine.

354
00:18:03,509 --> 00:18:05,269
Just let them come.
The more the merrier.

355
00:18:06,108 --> 00:18:07,949
Professor Ren, you had no idea.

356
00:18:08,069 --> 00:18:10,148
The village doctors
you trained last time

357
00:18:10,148 --> 00:18:12,269
have all become famous local doctors.

358
00:18:12,269 --> 00:18:13,989
All of them are very busy now.

359
00:18:14,788 --> 00:18:16,028
However, we still need to continue

360
00:18:16,348 --> 00:18:18,028
providing them with training.

361
00:18:18,668 --> 00:18:19,908
The more village doctors we have,

362
00:18:20,148 --> 00:18:21,869
the better the health condition
of the villagers.

363
00:18:24,148 --> 00:18:24,989
Professors, please.

364
00:18:25,028 --> 00:18:26,269
Okay, let's go.

365
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,829
Give me your ID cards.

366
00:18:30,668 --> 00:18:31,668
Tian Zhen, your ID card.

367
00:18:41,549 --> 00:18:42,346
Rebecca,

368
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,672
your ID card.

369
00:18:44,789 --> 00:18:46,108
It's fine. I'll do it myself.

370
00:18:47,149 --> 00:18:48,149
You're hiding it from me?

371
00:18:48,149 --> 00:18:49,308
What exactly is your Chinese name?

372
00:18:50,389 --> 00:18:52,029
Don't tell me you're a fugitive?

373
00:18:52,389 --> 00:18:53,669
You need to seek treatment
if you're sick in the head.

374
00:18:57,989 --> 00:18:58,873
Here you go.

375
00:19:02,549 --> 00:19:03,789
Excuse me. I wish to
complete my check-in.

376
00:19:04,149 --> 00:19:05,149
Wait there if you guys are together.

377
00:19:06,509 --> 00:19:07,909
We have a lot of people here today.

378
00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:09,029
Isn't it faster if you help us

379
00:19:09,029 --> 00:19:10,108
with the process too?

380
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:11,749
You guys are the only ones
staying here today.

381
00:19:11,749 --> 00:19:12,669
Why the rush?

382
00:19:15,389 --> 00:19:17,228
Here, take your ID cards.

383
00:19:17,989 --> 00:19:19,269
One card for each room.

384
00:19:19,269 --> 00:19:20,108
Check your floor number.

385
00:19:21,269 --> 00:19:22,149
Excuse me.

386
00:19:22,509 --> 00:19:23,355
So,

387
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:25,509
is there only one card for each room?

388
00:19:25,669 --> 00:19:27,269
Do you guys need a power card
for the room?

389
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,416
We do.

390
00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:30,308
This won't do. I need two cards.

391
00:19:31,108 --> 00:19:31,989
It's like this.

392
00:19:31,989 --> 00:19:33,389
This is our package.

393
00:19:33,669 --> 00:19:34,869
If you want

394
00:19:34,869 --> 00:19:36,509
to take another room card,

395
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:37,869
you have to pay an extra 1,000 yuan.

396
00:19:38,029 --> 00:19:39,509
That doesn't make any sense.

397
00:19:39,869 --> 00:19:40,670
Rebecca.

398
00:19:41,188 --> 00:19:42,308
Here, you can stay in this room.

399
00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:44,149
You can use the power

400
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:45,188
once you insert your credit card.

401
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,764
Excuse me.

402
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:49,269
You can change the details to hers
for this room.

403
00:19:50,029 --> 00:19:51,789
It's fine. The check-in
has been completed.

404
00:19:51,789 --> 00:19:53,389
You guys can swap the rooms if you like.

405
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:29,909
I just called the front desk.

406
00:21:29,909 --> 00:21:30,805
Why didn't you pick it up?

407
00:21:31,188 --> 00:21:32,108
It's fine. You're not disturbing me.

408
00:21:32,308 --> 00:21:33,669
What do you mean by that?

409
00:21:34,308 --> 00:21:35,509
I want to change my towel.

410
00:21:36,789 --> 00:21:37,749
I hung this towel

411
00:21:37,909 --> 00:21:39,549
on the back of my chair a few days ago.

412
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:40,389
You didn't change it at all.

413
00:21:40,389 --> 00:21:42,389
And, I've already put it
in the bathroom sink...

414
00:21:42,789 --> 00:21:43,789
I've already put it

415
00:21:43,789 --> 00:21:44,989
in the bathroom sink.

416
00:21:44,989 --> 00:21:46,389
Even so, no one changed it for me.

417
00:21:47,428 --> 00:21:48,509
Did you hear me?

418
00:21:48,509 --> 00:21:49,588
I want to change my towel.

419
00:21:49,588 --> 00:21:50,869
Each guest only has one towel.

420
00:21:52,029 --> 00:21:53,549
Wait, does that mean

421
00:21:53,549 --> 00:21:54,468
you won't change my towel for me

422
00:21:54,468 --> 00:21:56,029
even if I'm staying here
for half a month?

423
00:21:57,269 --> 00:21:58,708
Look, it's already wet.

424
00:21:58,749 --> 00:21:59,909
I can't use it.

425
00:22:00,989 --> 00:22:02,149
That doesn't matter.

426
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:04,389
What do you mean by that?

427
00:22:05,108 --> 00:22:06,188
It might not matter to you,

428
00:22:06,188 --> 00:22:07,228
but it matters to me.

429
00:22:07,228 --> 00:22:08,029
I want a change of towel.

430
00:22:08,029 --> 00:22:08,869
You hear me?

431
00:22:09,749 --> 00:22:10,789
Hello, do you need anything?

432
00:22:11,389 --> 00:22:12,789
-Listen.
-It's like this...

433
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:14,269
My sister-in-law

434
00:22:14,269 --> 00:22:15,149
was such a wretch.

435
00:22:15,149 --> 00:22:16,869
-Do you know that?
-No one changed my towel for me.

436
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:17,869
This is the one.

437
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:19,228
No one changed it for me

438
00:22:19,228 --> 00:22:20,588
even after all this while. Stop!

439
00:22:22,149 --> 00:22:23,348
Change my towel!

440
00:22:25,029 --> 00:22:26,389
What about this? Give it to me.

441
00:22:26,389 --> 00:22:27,509
I'll change it for you.

442
00:22:27,749 --> 00:22:28,780
No.

443
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:30,549
Here, each guest

444
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:31,749
only has one towel.

445
00:22:31,885 --> 00:22:32,682
What about this then?

446
00:22:33,149 --> 00:22:34,509
I'll do my check-out now.

447
00:22:34,509 --> 00:22:36,068
After that, I'll do the check-in again.
Okay?

448
00:22:36,269 --> 00:22:37,068
Does that mean

449
00:22:37,068 --> 00:22:38,509
you can change my towel for me by then?

450
00:22:38,749 --> 00:22:41,029
It's not like I don't know you.

451
00:22:41,188 --> 00:22:42,228
Even if you do your check-out now,

452
00:22:42,428 --> 00:22:44,108
you're still the same person.

453
00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:45,909
Enough. Stop it.

454
00:22:47,149 --> 00:22:48,029
Do you guys have washing machines here?

455
00:22:48,029 --> 00:22:49,389
I'll wash it myself, okay?

456
00:22:49,669 --> 00:22:50,749
We don't have washing machines here.

457
00:22:51,509 --> 00:22:52,909
That's not true. We do have them.

458
00:22:52,909 --> 00:22:54,669
It's just that they're
out of commission.

459
00:22:54,669 --> 00:22:55,520
Miss!

460
00:22:57,389 --> 00:22:58,669
Rebecca, you're here too?

461
00:22:58,869 --> 00:22:59,789
We can't use

462
00:22:59,789 --> 00:23:01,029
your washing machines at all.

463
00:23:01,029 --> 00:23:01,989
They're filled with

464
00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:03,509
sweet potatoes and potatoes.

465
00:23:03,509 --> 00:23:04,749
They're all filled up.

466
00:23:04,749 --> 00:23:05,909
We can't use them now.

467
00:23:06,188 --> 00:23:08,108
No one knows how to use

468
00:23:08,108 --> 00:23:09,149
the washing machines.

469
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:11,108
It's the same whether
we have washing machines or not.

470
00:23:11,108 --> 00:23:12,149
Having washing machines but don't know
how to use them is different from

471
00:23:12,149 --> 00:23:13,708
having no washing machines,

472
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:14,149
alright?

473
00:23:14,149 --> 00:23:15,389
You guys have washing machines here.

474
00:23:15,389 --> 00:23:16,228
But you said there weren't any.

475
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,588
You deceived me, understood?

476
00:23:17,588 --> 00:23:18,509
There's an issue with your attitude.

477
00:23:18,509 --> 00:23:19,909
Enough, Roubecca.
You have washing machines, right?

478
00:23:19,909 --> 00:23:20,989
-Yeah.
-If so,

479
00:23:20,989 --> 00:23:21,989
you should

480
00:23:21,989 --> 00:23:22,989
clean the washing machines

481
00:23:22,989 --> 00:23:24,389
and get rid of the potatoes.

482
00:23:24,389 --> 00:23:25,389
-Okay.
-I'll check them

483
00:23:25,389 --> 00:23:26,468
and see if they're spoiled.

484
00:23:26,468 --> 00:23:27,549
I'll see if we can use them, okay?

485
00:23:27,549 --> 00:23:29,228
No problem. I'll clean it right away.

486
00:23:29,228 --> 00:23:30,509
-Thank you.
-Calm down.

487
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:31,352
Thank you.

488
00:23:32,029 --> 00:23:33,108
Just ignore them.

489
00:23:33,108 --> 00:23:34,789
City dwellers are always troublesome.

490
00:23:35,509 --> 00:23:36,789
Enough. I'll check it out.

491
00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:38,269
-Thank you.
-Don't mention it.

492
00:23:38,269 --> 00:23:39,171
Go now.

493
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:40,549
Please hurry up then.

494
00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:41,460
Okay.

495
00:23:52,428 --> 00:23:53,332
Mr Ren.

496
00:23:54,509 --> 00:23:56,029
I don't understand something.
I need your help.

497
00:23:56,029 --> 00:23:56,843
Ask away.

498
00:23:57,149 --> 00:23:58,869
I don't understand

499
00:23:58,869 --> 00:23:59,869
why you come here every year.

500
00:24:00,149 --> 00:24:01,509
Are these people even worth our visit?

501
00:24:02,188 --> 00:24:03,021
What's the matter?

502
00:24:03,509 --> 00:24:04,789
I've never seen people

503
00:24:04,789 --> 00:24:06,468
as lazy as them before.

504
00:24:07,389 --> 00:24:08,269
Our nation has paved the road

505
00:24:08,269 --> 00:24:09,669
all the way to their doorsteps.

506
00:24:09,909 --> 00:24:10,749
They're receiving wage

507
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:11,629
for free.

508
00:24:11,869 --> 00:24:13,149
They have it real easy

509
00:24:13,149 --> 00:24:14,068
out here.

510
00:24:14,269 --> 00:24:15,588
But what do they do every day?

511
00:24:16,029 --> 00:24:17,468
They slack off inside.

512
00:24:17,468 --> 00:24:18,509
They idle around.

513
00:24:18,669 --> 00:24:19,669
Besides scrolling their phones,

514
00:24:19,669 --> 00:24:20,749
they only talk about

515
00:24:20,869 --> 00:24:22,068
meaningless topics

516
00:24:22,068 --> 00:24:23,108
in life.

517
00:24:23,509 --> 00:24:24,989
I don't understand why we must help them

518
00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:27,188
to alleviate poverty when
our targets are acting like that.

519
00:24:27,389 --> 00:24:28,389
What's the point?

520
00:24:29,789 --> 00:24:30,669
Actually,

521
00:24:31,909 --> 00:24:33,708
you were making a hasty generalization.

522
00:24:34,428 --> 00:24:36,468
Many people are working hard

523
00:24:36,789 --> 00:24:38,029
and leading life seriously.

524
00:24:38,308 --> 00:24:39,669
Anyway, I've been here for some time.

525
00:24:39,789 --> 00:24:42,389
At least half of them are
good-for-nothings.

526
00:24:42,389 --> 00:24:44,068
Isn't that enough?

527
00:24:48,149 --> 00:24:49,509
Yang, it's like this.

528
00:24:51,509 --> 00:24:52,308
The same kind of rice

529
00:24:53,269 --> 00:24:54,468
provides for 100 kinds of people.

530
00:24:55,269 --> 00:24:56,948
This is a vast world.

531
00:24:57,389 --> 00:24:59,509
You can't possibly expect

532
00:25:00,149 --> 00:25:01,348
every people to act like you.

533
00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:03,509
-Am I right?
-Master.

534
00:25:06,468 --> 00:25:07,301
Master,

535
00:25:07,789 --> 00:25:08,669
do you want

536
00:25:08,669 --> 00:25:09,669
to do your laundry?

537
00:25:09,669 --> 00:25:10,669
I'll do it for you.

538
00:25:11,188 --> 00:25:12,068
It's fine.

539
00:25:12,149 --> 00:25:13,029
It's been a few days.

540
00:25:13,029 --> 00:25:15,149
Master, we're here to help
alleviate poverty.

541
00:25:15,149 --> 00:25:16,749
We're not here to provide for the lazy.

542
00:25:16,749 --> 00:25:18,869
In the end, we're just assisting them.

543
00:25:18,869 --> 00:25:20,749
They have to at least
do something, right?

544
00:25:20,909 --> 00:25:22,428
We can't just do everything for them.

545
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:25,428
Tou Tou, what's your opinion on it?

546
00:25:29,188 --> 00:25:30,149
What do you mean?

547
00:25:30,149 --> 00:25:30,948
I don't have any opinions.

548
00:25:30,948 --> 00:25:32,948
I'm just asking you if you want
to do your laundry.

549
00:25:33,428 --> 00:25:34,989
You accumulated a lot of dirty laundry.

550
00:25:34,989 --> 00:25:36,549
You won't be able to get changed
if you don't wash them by today.

551
00:25:36,669 --> 00:25:38,308
Let's say some people are very lazy

552
00:25:38,308 --> 00:25:39,428
and they don't do any chores.

553
00:25:40,269 --> 00:25:42,269
Will you get anxious and frustrated?

554
00:25:42,389 --> 00:25:43,348
Everyone has their own personalities.

555
00:25:43,348 --> 00:25:44,428
Why should I get anxious or frustrated?

556
00:25:44,428 --> 00:25:46,509
But I'm anxious about the laundry.

557
00:25:46,509 --> 00:25:47,669
If it rains,

558
00:25:47,669 --> 00:25:48,828
I don't think we can dry them in time.

559
00:25:48,909 --> 00:25:50,068
Do you want to do your laundry or not?

560
00:25:50,428 --> 00:25:51,269
Not for now.

561
00:25:52,108 --> 00:25:53,269
By the way, Roubecca,

562
00:25:53,269 --> 00:25:55,629
I found a new towel in my bag.

563
00:25:55,989 --> 00:25:57,188
I'll get it for you if you want it.

564
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:03,108
I'm speechless.

565
00:26:03,269 --> 00:26:04,389
You two are...

566
00:26:04,509 --> 00:26:05,909
Yang,

567
00:26:06,389 --> 00:26:09,149
sometimes, you should
learn from Tou Tou.

568
00:26:09,789 --> 00:26:11,149
Empty talk harms the nation,

569
00:26:11,669 --> 00:26:12,948
practical action helps it thrive.

570
00:26:13,389 --> 00:26:14,549
Actually, everyone is born

571
00:26:14,549 --> 00:26:15,749
into this world

572
00:26:15,869 --> 00:26:17,389
with their own missions.

573
00:26:18,269 --> 00:26:19,269
Some people might find them

574
00:26:19,269 --> 00:26:20,428
while some might not.

575
00:26:20,909 --> 00:26:22,269
If you found your mission,

576
00:26:22,669 --> 00:26:24,029
you should lend a hand to those

577
00:26:24,029 --> 00:26:25,509
who haven't found it yet.

578
00:26:26,149 --> 00:26:27,428
There's an anthropologist

579
00:26:27,428 --> 00:26:28,948
called Margaret Mead.

580
00:26:29,509 --> 00:26:30,509
She once said

581
00:26:31,509 --> 00:26:32,789
that instead of

582
00:26:32,789 --> 00:26:35,029
fire

583
00:26:35,789 --> 00:26:36,909
or tools,

584
00:26:37,869 --> 00:26:39,269
a healed femur

585
00:26:39,909 --> 00:26:40,789
is the earliest sign

586
00:26:40,989 --> 00:26:42,029
of

587
00:26:42,389 --> 00:26:43,428
human civilization.

588
00:26:44,149 --> 00:26:45,108
What does that mean?

589
00:26:45,509 --> 00:26:47,269
That means humans have compassion.

590
00:26:47,789 --> 00:26:49,909
That we should help the weak.

591
00:26:51,629 --> 00:26:52,509
I'm sure you've read

592
00:26:52,509 --> 00:26:53,828
many books.

593
00:26:54,108 --> 00:26:56,029
I'm sure you have the ability
to think independently

594
00:26:56,188 --> 00:26:57,588
and rationally.

595
00:26:58,029 --> 00:27:00,188
However, you do lack something.

596
00:27:01,389 --> 00:27:02,669
How will Tou Tou describe it?

597
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,208
A human touch.

598
00:27:06,989 --> 00:27:07,909
You lack a human touch.

599
00:27:10,149 --> 00:27:11,308
Mr Ren, I don't think

600
00:27:11,308 --> 00:27:12,989
I lack a human touch.

601
00:27:13,149 --> 00:27:15,108
I just think that we should help those

602
00:27:15,108 --> 00:27:16,308
who are worth helping.

603
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:18,308
The predecessor you mentioned,

604
00:27:18,308 --> 00:27:19,669
who talked about the healed femur,

605
00:27:20,108 --> 00:27:21,629
she didn't make a living through labour.

606
00:27:21,629 --> 00:27:22,789
She was an intellectual.

607
00:27:23,188 --> 00:27:25,269
Other people couldn't find
their directions if they left her.

608
00:27:27,149 --> 00:27:28,108
Think about it this way.

609
00:27:29,149 --> 00:27:30,068
They might not be lazy.

610
00:27:30,269 --> 00:27:32,108
It might be a deficiency of qi
as stated in TCM.

611
00:27:33,188 --> 00:27:34,348
Didn't Master say this before?

612
00:27:34,909 --> 00:27:36,389
Someone who doesn't want

613
00:27:36,389 --> 00:27:37,269
to move

614
00:27:37,269 --> 00:27:38,468
or do anything

615
00:27:38,669 --> 00:27:40,749
might be experiencing an
imbalance of Yin and Yang, right?

616
00:27:41,269 --> 00:27:43,108
They just don't want to move.

617
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:45,509
It's an illness. We have to treat it.

618
00:27:45,869 --> 00:27:47,269
We're here to treat them.

619
00:27:47,549 --> 00:27:48,629
I think I'm sick too.

620
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,050
I'm experiencing a deficiency of qi.

621
00:27:50,269 --> 00:27:51,269
I'll take a break first.

622
00:27:51,468 --> 00:27:52,789
Take a break then.

623
00:27:57,789 --> 00:27:58,669
Are you doing your laundry or not?

624
00:28:01,149 --> 00:28:02,093
No.

625
00:28:03,029 --> 00:28:04,308
You're so dirty.

626
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:05,389
Goodness.

627
00:28:06,029 --> 00:28:07,708
Do you know how many days it has been
since you did your laundry?

628
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,519
Miss,

629
00:28:22,789 --> 00:28:24,188
regarding the methods
to use the washing machine,

630
00:28:24,188 --> 00:28:26,029
I've labelled them

631
00:28:26,029 --> 00:28:27,029
as Step One to Five.

632
00:28:27,669 --> 00:28:29,108
By then, just follow these instructions.

633
00:28:29,108 --> 00:28:30,428
I'm sure the washing machines
will work fine.

634
00:28:31,308 --> 00:28:32,269
You can paste this on the front desk

635
00:28:32,269 --> 00:28:33,149
and check it out every day.

636
00:28:33,308 --> 00:28:34,428
This...

637
00:28:35,269 --> 00:28:36,188
Can I even learn this?

638
00:28:38,869 --> 00:28:39,869
Why not?

639
00:28:39,909 --> 00:28:41,509
You can learn this
as long as you can read.

640
00:28:41,509 --> 00:28:42,909
I've already written everything down.

641
00:28:43,108 --> 00:28:44,149
Isn't it clear enough?

642
00:28:45,269 --> 00:28:46,068
Little girl,

643
00:28:46,789 --> 00:28:47,989
let me be honest with you.

644
00:28:47,989 --> 00:28:49,389
I'm working here

645
00:28:49,389 --> 00:28:50,708
because this job is easy

646
00:28:50,708 --> 00:28:51,909
and not troublesome.

647
00:28:52,669 --> 00:28:54,509
If I use this washing machine,

648
00:28:54,629 --> 00:28:56,149
I have to be responsible for it.

649
00:28:56,509 --> 00:28:58,029
That's so troublesome.

650
00:28:58,308 --> 00:29:00,428
Last time, I got myself into trouble.

651
00:29:00,669 --> 00:29:02,389
I climbed a ladder to clean the window.

652
00:29:02,909 --> 00:29:04,348
But I slipped

653
00:29:04,348 --> 00:29:05,188
and fell.

654
00:29:06,269 --> 00:29:07,188
I got a fracture because of that.

655
00:29:07,909 --> 00:29:09,389
Since then,

656
00:29:09,389 --> 00:29:10,269
I thought to myself

657
00:29:10,629 --> 00:29:11,909
that it didn't matter

658
00:29:11,909 --> 00:29:13,989
whether I cleaned the window or not.

659
00:29:14,509 --> 00:29:15,549
I broke my leg

660
00:29:15,549 --> 00:29:16,749
because I wanted to do something,
you know?

661
00:29:18,669 --> 00:29:19,909
-That's right.
-That's right.

662
00:29:20,269 --> 00:29:21,118
You do have a point.

663
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:26,468
Are you trying to PUA
(psychological manipulate) me here?

664
00:29:26,549 --> 00:29:28,389
What's that again?

665
00:29:28,389 --> 00:29:29,348
PUA?

666
00:29:32,029 --> 00:29:32,991
Just do the laundry.

667
00:29:35,269 --> 00:29:36,110
This...

668
00:29:36,669 --> 00:29:37,749
This is so troublesome.

669
00:29:46,389 --> 00:29:47,669
This tool is great, right?

670
00:29:48,749 --> 00:29:49,909
Yeah, this is great.

671
00:29:50,029 --> 00:29:50,989
You can reach it no matter

672
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:51,922
how tall it is.

673
00:29:51,947 --> 00:29:52,735
-Yeah.
-Am I right?

674
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,720
And, you just need to change the cloth

675
00:29:53,789 --> 00:29:54,869
if you wish to rinse it.

676
00:29:54,869 --> 00:29:55,662
It's very convenient.

677
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,829
Am I right?

678
00:29:57,269 --> 00:29:58,629
And, it's clean too, right?

679
00:30:01,029 --> 00:30:01,869
It's nice, right?

680
00:30:02,029 --> 00:30:03,389
-What do you think?
-It's great.

681
00:30:03,509 --> 00:30:05,188
It's convenient and easy to use.

682
00:30:05,188 --> 00:30:07,269
-Yeah.
-You can even clean the corners.

683
00:30:08,149 --> 00:30:08,948
Yeah.

684
00:30:09,509 --> 00:30:10,468
It looks brand new now.

685
00:30:10,789 --> 00:30:11,948
I was treating

686
00:30:11,948 --> 00:30:13,389
their spine issues.

687
00:30:13,389 --> 00:30:14,373
I told them

688
00:30:14,509 --> 00:30:15,989
that their spines will
definitely get better

689
00:30:15,989 --> 00:30:17,509
if they do this for
half an hour every day.

690
00:30:17,909 --> 00:30:18,828
You're right.

691
00:30:19,428 --> 00:30:21,108
If you do this for half an hour

692
00:30:21,149 --> 00:30:22,149
to one hour every day,

693
00:30:22,308 --> 00:30:24,149
your spine will recover.

694
00:30:26,269 --> 00:30:27,149
Yang,

695
00:30:27,749 --> 00:30:29,789
you're good at discovering issues.

696
00:30:30,389 --> 00:30:31,588
That's outstanding.

697
00:30:32,428 --> 00:30:33,629
However, it's even more outstanding

698
00:30:34,308 --> 00:30:35,789
if you can resolve the issues.

699
00:30:36,149 --> 00:30:38,308
You chose to ignore them.

700
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,804
You chose to starve them

701
00:30:39,909 --> 00:30:40,749
as punishment.

702
00:30:41,749 --> 00:30:43,188
If that's the case,

703
00:30:43,789 --> 00:30:46,428
they'll be even lazier.

704
00:30:48,749 --> 00:30:50,669
No matter who acts first,

705
00:30:51,669 --> 00:30:53,188
the stalemate will be changed.

706
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,915
(Steps for Using The Washing Machine)

707
00:31:06,269 --> 00:31:07,789
This won't do.

708
00:31:07,789 --> 00:31:08,669
Slow down.

709
00:31:08,989 --> 00:31:10,269
My body is still too weak.

710
00:31:10,269 --> 00:31:11,828
-It's like this at first.
-I'm so sweaty.

711
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:12,629
You see, when you move,

712
00:31:12,629 --> 00:31:13,909
Yang energy will be generated.

713
00:31:14,149 --> 00:31:15,348
It'll be obvious

714
00:31:15,348 --> 00:31:16,188
once you get used to it.

715
00:31:16,188 --> 00:31:17,075
Let me do it.

716
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:19,029
-Thank you.
-Take a break.

717
00:31:20,348 --> 00:31:21,235
Here I go.

718
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:31,708
Take a break. It's fine.

719
00:32:27,869 --> 00:32:28,869
Who grew these?

720
00:32:30,989 --> 00:32:32,389
They're growing so much.

721
00:32:34,428 --> 00:32:35,708
They should stop growing.

722
00:32:35,708 --> 00:32:37,149
If so, my herbs

723
00:32:37,149 --> 00:32:38,108
will be done for.

724
00:32:38,669 --> 00:32:39,989
Don't worry. Leave it to me.

725
00:32:39,989 --> 00:32:41,509
I won't cause trouble for you.

726
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:46,909
Look at all these fruits.

727
00:32:58,685 --> 00:32:59,925
Look, it looks drained.

728
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:00,764
Over here.

729
00:33:00,789 --> 00:33:01,629
This place. That's right.

730
00:33:08,308 --> 00:33:09,179
Does it look nice?

731
00:33:09,749 --> 00:33:10,650
It grew well.

732
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:13,269
It's all thanks to Tou Tou.

733
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:14,871
How did you know?

734
00:33:16,029 --> 00:33:17,149
What are you doing?

735
00:33:20,389 --> 00:33:21,789
You saw it when I spit the pit out?

736
00:33:22,789 --> 00:33:24,108
I know everything you do.

737
00:33:24,269 --> 00:33:25,149
Did you install a surveillance camera?

738
00:33:27,443 --> 00:33:28,348
Can I try one?

739
00:33:28,789 --> 00:33:29,716
No.

740
00:33:31,269 --> 00:33:32,149
There's a rotten one.

741
00:33:32,909 --> 00:33:33,909
Remove it.

742
00:33:39,029 --> 00:33:40,428
Meng Meng, do you want to try?

743
00:33:41,428 --> 00:33:42,468
Come here.

744
00:33:43,269 --> 00:33:44,468
Yes, tie it here.

745
00:33:45,269 --> 00:33:46,269
Cross it over. Here.

746
00:33:47,509 --> 00:33:48,393
That's right.

747
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:04,687
(Major Snow doesn't necessarily mean
that snow will increase significantly.)

748
00:34:05,718 --> 00:34:08,872
(It means that the weather
will get colder.)

749
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:14,063
(It's popular for people
to consume red date cakes)

750
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,576
(and enjoy the freezing of rivers.)

751
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,272
(Major Snow)

752
00:34:35,749 --> 00:34:37,108
When the professor is here,

753
00:34:37,308 --> 00:34:38,188
you guys must greet him.

754
00:34:40,308 --> 00:34:41,228
Did you hear me?

755
00:34:45,789 --> 00:34:46,588
Professor.

756
00:34:47,228 --> 00:34:48,428
Sorry for the trouble.

757
00:34:48,428 --> 00:34:49,549
Long time no see.

758
00:34:49,549 --> 00:34:51,149
-Yeah.
-I need to seek your help again.

759
00:34:51,149 --> 00:34:52,389
No problem. What is it?

760
00:34:52,669 --> 00:34:53,468
It's like this.

761
00:34:53,948 --> 00:34:54,830
This is my son.

762
00:34:57,228 --> 00:34:58,149
Come and greet the professor.

763
00:34:59,749 --> 00:35:01,149
Your son is all grown up.

764
00:35:01,948 --> 00:35:02,909
(Liu Zi Hong)
Greet him!

765
00:35:03,509 --> 00:35:04,463
Liu,

766
00:35:05,068 --> 00:35:06,468
you're elder than me.

767
00:35:06,629 --> 00:35:07,468
He can call me uncle.

768
00:35:09,029 --> 00:35:10,188
-Hello, Uncle.
-Hello.

769
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,429
What's the matter?

770
00:35:12,708 --> 00:35:13,948
This child has encountered some issues.

771
00:35:14,948 --> 00:35:16,149
I hope you can

772
00:35:16,149 --> 00:35:16,989
give him

773
00:35:17,948 --> 00:35:19,629
a medical certificate of depression.

774
00:35:19,869 --> 00:35:20,669
Depression?

775
00:35:20,669 --> 00:35:21,702
I'm not sick.

776
00:35:23,708 --> 00:35:25,600
Liu, what's the matter?

777
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,160
Don't misunderstand me.

778
00:35:27,182 --> 00:35:28,749
He's not depressed for real.

779
00:35:28,948 --> 00:35:30,029
It's like this.

780
00:35:30,389 --> 00:35:31,708
My son's result

781
00:35:31,708 --> 00:35:32,669
was pretty good.

782
00:35:32,909 --> 00:35:34,389
Although he can't get into Harvard

783
00:35:34,389 --> 00:35:35,308
or Stanford,

784
00:35:35,308 --> 00:35:37,789
he has no issues getting into

785
00:35:37,789 --> 00:35:38,909
the top 30 universities in the world.

786
00:35:38,909 --> 00:35:39,948
He'll be taking the college
entrance exam next year.

787
00:35:39,948 --> 00:35:41,228
But he said he wanted
to drop out of school this year.

788
00:35:41,669 --> 00:35:43,509
He wishes to be a...

789
00:35:43,509 --> 00:35:45,188
What was it again?

790
00:35:45,188 --> 00:35:46,309
An idol trainee.

791
00:35:46,309 --> 00:35:47,349
I'm going to make a debut as an idol.

792
00:35:48,388 --> 00:35:49,385
You see?

793
00:35:51,708 --> 00:35:52,628
He wants to be an idol trainee.

794
00:35:52,628 --> 00:35:53,468
Is he your son?

795
00:35:54,269 --> 00:35:56,668
You want to join a talent show?

796
00:35:57,948 --> 00:35:58,989
I have infinite potential.

797
00:35:59,269 --> 00:36:00,829
It's worth it if you invest in me.

798
00:36:01,468 --> 00:36:02,400
Look at him.

799
00:36:02,989 --> 00:36:04,148
Look, he's all fired up

800
00:36:04,148 --> 00:36:06,029
when we talk about that.

801
00:36:06,188 --> 00:36:07,468
I started getting into street dance
when I was in junior high.

802
00:36:07,468 --> 00:36:08,589
You just had no idea.

803
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:09,628
What's the matter?

804
00:36:10,228 --> 00:36:11,908
He wants me to give him

805
00:36:11,908 --> 00:36:12,948
a medical certificate of depression.

806
00:36:12,948 --> 00:36:13,868
You're getting ahead
of yourself, aren't you?

807
00:36:13,868 --> 00:36:15,109
-Have you lost your mind?
-A medical certificate?

808
00:36:15,708 --> 00:36:17,668
Professor, it's like this.
This kid doesn't even

809
00:36:17,789 --> 00:36:19,109
want to attend school now.

810
00:36:19,708 --> 00:36:21,309
I'm just trying to think of a way

811
00:36:21,309 --> 00:36:22,829
to apply for a semester break

812
00:36:22,829 --> 00:36:24,509
for him.

813
00:36:24,668 --> 00:36:26,628
You get me?
Once his three-minute passion is over,

814
00:36:26,868 --> 00:36:28,188
at least he can return to school.

815
00:36:28,509 --> 00:36:29,628
If not, his future will be ruined.

816
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,148
How could you bear to let the child

817
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:34,228
not graduate from high school?

818
00:36:34,388 --> 00:36:36,109
That won't do.

819
00:36:36,349 --> 00:36:37,668
Can you stop that?

820
00:36:38,628 --> 00:36:39,789
Liu, calm down.

821
00:36:39,789 --> 00:36:41,069
-Wait.
-Come, have a seat.

822
00:36:42,228 --> 00:36:43,269
Please do me this favour.

823
00:36:43,269 --> 00:36:44,157
Stop that.

824
00:36:44,228 --> 00:36:45,109
You see,

825
00:36:45,228 --> 00:36:46,468
I'll ask the child first.

826
00:36:47,309 --> 00:36:48,349
Keep quiet for now.

827
00:36:48,549 --> 00:36:50,388
Why are you pulling them out?
You're so inconsiderate.

828
00:36:52,549 --> 00:36:53,628
Boy,

829
00:36:53,749 --> 00:36:54,603
come here.

830
00:36:54,628 --> 00:36:55,665
Come here.

831
00:36:57,109 --> 00:36:59,029
Boy, what's your name?

832
00:37:02,228 --> 00:37:03,069
My name is Liu Zi Hong.

833
00:37:03,468 --> 00:37:05,468
Liu Zi Hong? That's a great name.

834
00:37:06,628 --> 00:37:07,989
I wish to ask you something.

835
00:37:07,989 --> 00:37:10,868
Have you decided to be an idol?

836
00:37:13,789 --> 00:37:14,731
That's right.

837
00:37:15,309 --> 00:37:16,228
Have you ever thought of this?

838
00:37:16,228 --> 00:37:17,509
Say, what if

839
00:37:18,428 --> 00:37:19,388
you weren't selected,

840
00:37:19,388 --> 00:37:20,468
or what if you lost

841
00:37:21,109 --> 00:37:22,388
after being selected?

842
00:37:22,509 --> 00:37:23,388
What do you plan to do

843
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:24,829
in the future then?

844
00:37:25,948 --> 00:37:26,989
We can talk about it
after I get selected.

845
00:37:28,309 --> 00:37:30,309
If we don't do it, that means
there's no possibility at all.

846
00:37:30,708 --> 00:37:31,589
If I give it a try,

847
00:37:31,789 --> 00:37:33,509
even if I fail this time,

848
00:37:34,708 --> 00:37:35,708
I'll try again next year.

849
00:37:36,549 --> 00:37:37,388
Look at him.

850
00:37:37,708 --> 00:37:39,188
Liu, calm down.

851
00:37:42,228 --> 00:37:44,948
I know you've done me a lot of favours.

852
00:37:45,269 --> 00:37:47,228
This is the only thing

853
00:37:47,228 --> 00:37:48,668
I can help you out professionally.

854
00:37:49,309 --> 00:37:50,668
I know you're doing this
for your son's sake.

855
00:37:51,388 --> 00:37:52,989
However,

856
00:37:53,868 --> 00:37:54,908
I cannot

857
00:37:55,269 --> 00:37:56,228
help you out this time.

858
00:37:56,789 --> 00:37:57,668
Do you think

859
00:37:58,228 --> 00:38:00,148
that I'm asking you to
forge the certificate?

860
00:38:00,829 --> 00:38:01,708
That's not it.

861
00:38:02,188 --> 00:38:03,029
He's mentally unstable

862
00:38:03,029 --> 00:38:04,188
for having such thoughts.

863
00:38:04,668 --> 00:38:05,549
If this continues,

864
00:38:05,708 --> 00:38:07,388
I'll get depressed before him.

865
00:38:07,468 --> 00:38:08,309
Liu,

866
00:38:08,948 --> 00:38:09,749
you see,

867
00:38:10,228 --> 00:38:11,948
I've never really

868
00:38:11,948 --> 00:38:13,029
tried to understand street dance

869
00:38:13,029 --> 00:38:15,188
or talent shows.

870
00:38:15,989 --> 00:38:17,148
What about this? Tou Tou.

871
00:38:19,628 --> 00:38:20,749
Let's hear what Tou Tou has to say.

872
00:38:20,749 --> 00:38:22,228
It's okay

873
00:38:22,509 --> 00:38:23,351
as long as Tou Tou thinks it's fine.

874
00:38:24,428 --> 00:38:25,296
Me?

875
00:38:25,908 --> 00:38:26,948
You're one of

876
00:38:27,228 --> 00:38:28,148
the successors too.

877
00:38:28,388 --> 00:38:29,388
But Master, he...

878
00:38:29,789 --> 00:38:30,948
Yeah, we should listen to her.

879
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:32,445
She...

880
00:38:33,309 --> 00:38:35,628
This concerns my son's future.

881
00:38:35,628 --> 00:38:36,468
Professor,

882
00:38:36,468 --> 00:38:38,148
you want a kid like her
to decide his future?

883
00:38:38,148 --> 00:38:39,908
Don't you think this joke
has gone too far?

884
00:38:39,908 --> 00:38:42,109
They're masters of their own lives.

885
00:38:42,428 --> 00:38:43,789
We can't just

886
00:38:43,789 --> 00:38:45,188
always treat them like kids.

887
00:38:46,228 --> 00:38:47,668
Now, we're here

888
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:49,148
to supervise them

889
00:38:49,228 --> 00:38:50,749
while they discuss their opinions.

890
00:38:50,908 --> 00:38:51,908
Isn't that good?

891
00:38:52,228 --> 00:38:53,161
Tou Tou,

892
00:38:54,109 --> 00:38:55,309
tell us what you think.

893
00:39:01,269 --> 00:39:02,509
Do you really wish to be a dancer?

894
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,562
Of course.

895
00:39:03,948 --> 00:39:05,908
I acted as a prince
ever since I was in kindergarten.

896
00:39:05,948 --> 00:39:06,789
Since young,

897
00:39:06,789 --> 00:39:08,228
I have always been
at the centre of the stage.

898
00:39:08,468 --> 00:39:09,549
And, I need to join

899
00:39:09,549 --> 00:39:10,549
the hottest talent show.

900
00:39:10,549 --> 00:39:12,188
I will make my debut
as the centre member.

901
00:39:14,148 --> 00:39:14,948
I'll go even if it means
he'll break my legs.

902
00:39:14,948 --> 00:39:16,228
I'll break your legs right now!

903
00:39:16,309 --> 00:39:17,222
Mr Liu,

904
00:39:18,109 --> 00:39:19,148
we know

905
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:21,309
that you've done us plenty of favours.

906
00:39:21,388 --> 00:39:22,628
And, you were nice to us too.

907
00:39:23,148 --> 00:39:24,388
However,

908
00:39:24,388 --> 00:39:25,428
we can repay the favour

909
00:39:25,428 --> 00:39:26,868
in another way.

910
00:39:26,868 --> 00:39:29,549
For example, we can monitor your health

911
00:39:29,549 --> 00:39:31,349
and take care of you when you're old.

912
00:39:31,509 --> 00:39:33,309
As for the medical certificate,

913
00:39:33,549 --> 00:39:34,868
I don't think it'll work.

914
00:39:35,188 --> 00:39:36,749
As for why,

915
00:39:37,309 --> 00:39:38,228
you see, no one can predict

916
00:39:38,228 --> 00:39:39,628
the future.

917
00:39:39,868 --> 00:39:41,269
Even if we do give him
the medical certificate,

918
00:39:41,868 --> 00:39:43,789
at most it'll last for one year.

919
00:39:43,789 --> 00:39:45,069
What if your son

920
00:39:45,628 --> 00:39:47,188
returns to school within that period?

921
00:39:47,708 --> 00:39:48,868
What if he gets into
a top local university?

922
00:39:49,549 --> 00:39:50,989
Won't this medical certificate

923
00:39:50,989 --> 00:39:52,269
affect his future then?

924
00:39:52,908 --> 00:39:54,269
What if he wants to be a civil servant

925
00:39:54,269 --> 00:39:55,908
on a whim?

926
00:39:56,109 --> 00:39:57,228
I'm sure this medical certificate

927
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,509
will affect his result.

928
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,440
What do you think?

929
00:40:00,468 --> 00:40:01,708
Dad, did you hear that?

930
00:40:02,868 --> 00:40:03,948
I think

931
00:40:06,309 --> 00:40:07,628
it's not suitable for you
to join a talent show.

932
00:40:09,029 --> 00:40:09,986
Go on.

933
00:40:11,388 --> 00:40:12,989
I think it's not suitable

934
00:40:13,309 --> 00:40:15,228
for the time being.

935
00:40:16,029 --> 00:40:17,029
You'll be taking
the college entrance exam

936
00:40:17,029 --> 00:40:17,989
by next year.

937
00:40:18,188 --> 00:40:19,708
I think there's no need to rush.

938
00:40:19,948 --> 00:40:21,029
After the exam,

939
00:40:21,029 --> 00:40:21,829
you can choose

940
00:40:21,948 --> 00:40:22,908
a university

941
00:40:22,908 --> 00:40:24,029
that provides courses
that are related to your hobby.

942
00:40:24,069 --> 00:40:25,109
Once you get into a university,

943
00:40:25,109 --> 00:40:25,989
you can do

944
00:40:25,989 --> 00:40:27,188
whatever you want to do.

945
00:40:27,549 --> 00:40:28,868
If so, I won't be able to
make it this year.

946
00:40:28,948 --> 00:40:29,908
That doesn't matter.

947
00:40:29,948 --> 00:40:30,749
Yeah.

948
00:40:30,749 --> 00:40:31,908
It does matter.

949
00:40:31,948 --> 00:40:32,908
I want to make my debut this year.

950
00:40:32,908 --> 00:40:33,789
Look at you.

951
00:40:34,948 --> 00:40:37,628
Right now, you're restless
and impatient.

952
00:40:37,749 --> 00:40:38,668
You have a short temper,

953
00:40:38,668 --> 00:40:39,948
kid.

954
00:40:40,948 --> 00:40:42,188
I don't suggest you

955
00:40:42,349 --> 00:40:43,509
join the talent show this year.

956
00:40:44,428 --> 00:40:45,749
In your current state of mind,

957
00:40:45,948 --> 00:40:46,989
you cannot withstand pressure.

958
00:40:47,428 --> 00:40:49,228
You have to adjust your state of mind

959
00:40:49,349 --> 00:40:50,749
and establish a solid foothold.

960
00:40:51,269 --> 00:40:52,868
You can go once

961
00:40:53,069 --> 00:40:54,948
your body and qi are well-regulated.

962
00:40:56,228 --> 00:40:57,549
You'll definitely win by then.

963
00:40:59,468 --> 00:41:00,507
Did you hear him?

964
00:41:01,109 --> 00:41:01,908
The professor is right.

965
00:41:02,109 --> 00:41:02,948
You might not like dancing

966
00:41:02,948 --> 00:41:04,309
by next year.

967
00:41:04,349 --> 00:41:06,269
By then, you can study
financial management.

968
00:41:06,269 --> 00:41:07,104
Am I right?

969
00:41:07,188 --> 00:41:08,589
Just you wish.

970
00:41:08,749 --> 00:41:10,109
I will never

971
00:41:10,628 --> 00:41:12,388
lead my life

972
00:41:12,388 --> 00:41:13,509
according to your plan.

973
00:41:13,708 --> 00:41:14,868
Brat, if you're that capable,

974
00:41:14,908 --> 00:41:15,948
don't spend my money then.

975
00:41:15,948 --> 00:41:16,908
No, I won't then.

976
00:41:16,908 --> 00:41:18,868
-You said so yourself!
-Master.

977
00:41:19,468 --> 00:41:21,549
Before this, you told me

978
00:41:21,549 --> 00:41:22,532
about the word "destiny".

979
00:41:23,829 --> 00:41:24,765
That's right.

980
00:41:25,509 --> 00:41:26,686
Mr Liu,

981
00:41:28,468 --> 00:41:30,269
you have a great son.

982
00:41:31,228 --> 00:41:32,948
He found his own destiny

983
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:34,029
at such a young age.

984
00:41:36,188 --> 00:41:38,109
He loves his hobby passionately,

985
00:41:38,468 --> 00:41:39,789
and he works hard on it.

986
00:41:42,349 --> 00:41:43,908
I have a suggestion.

987
00:41:44,428 --> 00:41:45,269
You can apply to your school

988
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:46,228
for a break.

989
00:41:46,509 --> 00:41:47,428
You can retain your qualifications

990
00:41:47,428 --> 00:41:48,388
and chase your dream.

991
00:41:49,029 --> 00:41:50,021
Mr Liu,

992
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:52,029
you need to be open-minded.

993
00:41:52,029 --> 00:41:53,228
It's common for youngsters

994
00:41:53,228 --> 00:41:54,228
to chase their dreams.

995
00:41:54,228 --> 00:41:55,829
And, it's a positive thing.

996
00:41:56,388 --> 00:41:57,428
Look at him.

997
00:41:57,428 --> 00:41:58,628
He's hard-working
when it comes to dancing.

998
00:41:59,188 --> 00:42:00,549
He might win a prize

999
00:42:00,549 --> 00:42:01,473
and be the next dancing champion.

1000
00:42:01,789 --> 00:42:03,228
He might become popular in an instant.

1001
00:42:03,708 --> 00:42:04,509
By then,

1002
00:42:04,668 --> 00:42:05,509
if people

1003
00:42:05,628 --> 00:42:06,668
hear about this medical certificate,

1004
00:42:07,188 --> 00:42:08,188
all eyes

1005
00:42:08,188 --> 00:42:08,989
will be on him.

1006
00:42:09,549 --> 00:42:10,908
It'll be too late to regret it by then.

1007
00:42:10,908 --> 00:42:11,708
Do you know what will happen?

1008
00:42:11,749 --> 00:42:12,868
His reputation will be ruined.

1009
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:14,908
It's very serious.

1010
00:42:14,948 --> 00:42:15,877
Liu,

1011
00:42:17,228 --> 00:42:18,349
Tou Tou made

1012
00:42:18,349 --> 00:42:19,989
a great point, right?

1013
00:42:20,708 --> 00:42:21,637
Tou Tou,

1014
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,829
you've impressed me once again.

1015
00:42:23,829 --> 00:42:25,349
Liu, have a seat.

1016
00:42:25,349 --> 00:42:28,948
Let's do what Tou Tou said, okay?

1017
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,823
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

1018
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,228
(are referenced from relevant
traditional Chinese medicine books)

00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,267
