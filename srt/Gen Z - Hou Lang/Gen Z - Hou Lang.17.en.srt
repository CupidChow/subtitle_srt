1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,277
You still have to pass on

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,360
your family's legacy.

3
00:00:07,493 --> 00:00:08,637
Are you going

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:09,720
to ignore your elders?

5
00:00:12,046 --> 00:00:13,179
That won't be the case.

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,200
You don't understand my mother.

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,400
My mother won't fall out with me.

8
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,040
This problem will be resolved

9
00:00:18,124 --> 00:00:20,124
after some time.

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,677
Don't tell me

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,880
you fell for Meng Meng?

12
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,640
What nonsense are you saying?

13
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:34,957
I think you and your father

14
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,760
don't love Niece-in-law at all.

15
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,400
She's the one providing you two
with all her love.

16
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,800
You two are ingrates.

17
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,640
Don't try to drive a wedge between us.

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,957
Who says I don't love my mother?

19
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,040
I'm not driving a wedge between you two.

20
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,437
I'm motherless.

21
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,357
If I did have a mother,

22
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,000
I wouldn't make her upset
for other people's sake.

23
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,640
If I were her,
I would've given birth to another child.

24
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:57,380
I'll sever my ties with
an ingrate like you.

25
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,560
Let me tell you something.
You have no idea.

26
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,840
My mother loves me

27
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,040
the most.

28
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,040
I know that.

29
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,440
Wait.

30
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,120
What should I do

31
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,480
if you guys leave now?

32
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,120
What has my departure
got to do with you?

33
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,037
Once you leave,

34
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,317
the four elders will keep an eye on me

35
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,037
constantly.

36
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,200
How could I lead a carefree life then?

37
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,677
If so, you should cherish the time

38
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,797
when I can still help you

39
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,960
to distract them.

40
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,360
But it'll end soon.

41
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,400
Wait, can you please don't leave?

42
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,080
You don't get to decide that.

43
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,160
You ingrate.

44
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,560
Ren Tian Zhen, you're an ingrate.

45
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,760
I'm serious.

46
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,120
You're a total ingrate.

47
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,400
Your mother is here.

48
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,400
Ren Tian Zhen,

49
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,040
I'm your mother.

50
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,520
Do you truly intend to
go against your mother

51
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,520
because of Meng Meng?

52
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,157
I'm your son.

53
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,320
However, Meng Meng is my patient too.

54
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,480
You're an adult with
a healthy state of mind.

55
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,477
But she's not.

56
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,037
Since I have to choose between you two,

57
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,400
of course I'll choose her.

58
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,720
It's precisely because
she's your patient

59
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,200
that you shouldn't

60
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,600
be nice to her

61
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,680
with any ulterior motives

62
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,360
when it comes to both
private and public affairs.

63
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,560
That's the rule.

64
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,957
If I do get together with her,

65
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,360
I'm sure her parents will be elated.

66
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,557
I'm sure they'll leave her

67
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,517
to me.

68
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,480
You!

69
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,360
Tell me. Even since you were born,

70
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,520
have I ever made you

71
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,640
endure any hardships?

72
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,837
Didn't I provide you

73
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,080
with all the freedom you want?

74
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,920
However, you need to obey me

75
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,320
when it comes to choosing
your girlfriend.

76
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,960
Mum, don't forget.

77
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,840
Your scope of power

78
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,120
only extends from you

79
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,640
to Dad.

80
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,680
Please do not cross the line.

81
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,760
That's right.

82
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,840
You guys have to stay under

83
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,080
my scope of power.

84
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,240
Meng Meng can stay.

85
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,920
-Can she?
-Of course.

86
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,997
I can only rest at ease when you two

87
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,080
are under my nose.

88
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:31,957
Mum,

89
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,400
you're still the head of the family.

90
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,920
I'm glad you understand.

91
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,840
Take care.

92
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,397
Hello?

93
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,320
Hello.

94
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,557
I contacted you

95
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,600
to rent a unit before this.

96
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,837
I don't need it for now.

97
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,277
Thank you. Sorry for the trouble.

98
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,160
Sorry about that.

99
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,680
Okay.

100
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,880
This is great.

101
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,200
(First Frost is the last
solar term of autumn)

102
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,440
(and it signals
the beginning of winter.)

103
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,560
(As a folk saying goes,)

104
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:28,280
(nourishing your body
during First Frost is important.)

105
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,280
(First Frost)

106
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,440
Are you okay? The car is pretty shaky.

107
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,640
Did you guys see that?

108
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,640
Master,

109
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,117
I thought we were going to provide
free medical consultation?

110
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,400
Why are we entering the mountains again?

111
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,760
Aconite

112
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,437
sprouts before Minor Snow.

113
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,717
That's why we have to check out

114
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,160
the sprouts of aconite

115
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,280
before providing the service.

116
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,760
Earthquake affects
the harvest of aconite severely.

117
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,757
That's why we'll come here

118
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,837
every year whenever it's time
to plant them.

119
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,280
This year is pretty good.

120
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,397
The aconite they sent
to our medical centre

121
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,640
are abundant in both quality
and quantity.

122
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,800
Do you feel sick?

123
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,157
Grandson,

124
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,237
drive slower.

125
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,157
The road is bumpy.

126
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,437
Look at how you're driving.

127
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,920
Meng Meng is going to throw up soon.

128
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,597
I don't want this to happen too.

129
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,997
But we have to hike today.

130
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,960
If we don't hurry,
we can't reach before dusk.

131
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,920
Wait.

132
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,169
But she...
I'm sitting beside her.

133
00:06:23,253 --> 00:06:24,893
What if she throws up and I'm affected?

134
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,240
There's a plastic bag there.

135
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,920
Meng Meng, hang in there.

136
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,800
The older the wiser indeed.

137
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,800
Look at Master and Madam.

138
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,400
They feel nothing at all.

139
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,957
Look, Madam is even closing her eyes.

140
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,877
She looks like she's enjoying the ride.

141
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,000
This is nothing.

142
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,837
I've travelled to all kinds of places

143
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,920
together with your master.

144
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,240
I've endured all kinds of hardships.

145
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,960
There was a time when I couldn't
take a bath for an entire month.

146
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,560
Why are you so proud of that?

147
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,077
Stop patting your leg.

148
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,120
You'll throw up.

149
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,240
(Gen Z)

150
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,520
(Starry Sky)

151
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,960
(Starry Sky)

152
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,440
(Starry Sky)

153
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,120
Thank you for helping us out.

154
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,120
Are you exhausted?

155
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,917
If so, we can take a break.

156
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,040
Okay.

157
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,680
I didn't expect you to like that song.

158
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,720
It wasn't your style.

159
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,837
I was always full of energy

160
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,837
when I was staying in the orphanage.

161
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,800
I wasn't willing to sleep.

162
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,320
After that,

163
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,000
the caretaker

164
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,000
carried me.

165
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,080
I leaned my head against her shoulder.

166
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,880
She sang while taking a walk

167
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:33,997
in the courtyard.

168
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,000
That's how I was able to fall asleep.

169
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,000
I became an orphan due to the flood.

170
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,960
I have no impression
of my mother whatsoever.

171
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,600
However,

172
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,477
whenever I hear this song,

173
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,560
I'll be reminded of

174
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,920
the moment when I leaned
my head against her shoulder.

175
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,277
That was probably my only impression

176
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,280
of my mother.

177
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,400
We need to hike that hill, right?

178
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,357
We're almost there.

179
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,477
We'll reach there
after crossing this hill.

180
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,680
But we just crossed one.

181
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,840
That's right.

182
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,797
Descend diagonally.

183
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,680
Mr Ren,

184
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,240
how far away are we from
the aconite field?

185
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,600
It's nearby.

186
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,560
We'll reach it after crossing this hill.

187
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,200
It's nearby.

188
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,600
We're not there yet?

189
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,360
Charge!

190
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,957
Charge!

191
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,840
-Be careful!
-Charge!

192
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,320
You'll fall, you know?

193
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,240
Have you brewed it for four hours?

194
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,397
I started brewing it after

195
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,357
you started to hike the mountain.

196
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,000
It's been over five hours.

197
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,077
Are you sure the fire was always there?

198
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,280
Yes.

199
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,440
Let's dig in.

200
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,840
Let's dig in!

201
00:11:59,120 --> 00:11:59,997
Do you guys know

202
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,400
what's the most important element

203
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,360
of this dish?

204
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,397
The most important element

205
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,360
is that it must be cooked
for over four hours

206
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,360
without stopping the heat.

207
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,240
Are you referring to this chicken soup?

208
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,920
That's right.

209
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,837
This soup

210
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:18,800
contains aconite.

211
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,320
Aconite contains Aconitine.

212
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,680
Aconitine is poisonous.

213
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,560
We have to neutralize the poison

214
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,237
for aconite

215
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,440
to be effective.

216
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,277
Mister,

217
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,960
can you tell us earlier next time?

218
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,720
I've already finished the chicken feet.

219
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,277
Don't you think it's too late
to tell us about that?

220
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,837
What if we get poisoned

221
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,840
and die?

222
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,437
I already took it.

223
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,357
Everyone else took it too.

224
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,680
What are you afraid of?

225
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,837
Do you think your life
is more precious than the others?

226
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,880
That's not it.
Both of us are successors.

227
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,120
We have a heavy burden on our shoulders.

228
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,957
We cannot live for our sake.

229
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,037
Many people are waiting for us

230
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,240
to contribute to the world.

231
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,837
I'll skip it. Here.

232
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,040
You guys can go ahead.

233
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,397
Tou Tou, don't worry.

234
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,517
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

235
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,480
I made this soup

236
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,637
under your master's

237
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,160
guidance.

238
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,160
Don't worry.

239
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,920
Professor Ren

240
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,160
is a kind Samaritan.

241
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,037
We, the Poverty Alleviation Office,

242
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,277
invited him personally

243
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,400
to help us

244
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,517
assess the fields,

245
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,517
observe the weather,

246
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,920
and guide us to plant

247
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,240
aconite, Gastrodia elata
and Solomon's seal.

248
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,080
You guys saw

249
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,600
our village yourselves.

250
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,560
We're hidden deep in the mountains.

251
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,877
It's a remote place

252
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,240
with no resources.

253
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,240
It's inconvenient
for us to enter or exit the place.

254
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,000
But now, it's much better.

255
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,560
When Professor Ren is here,

256
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,360
we could plant and harvest herbs.

257
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,397
We got a job

258
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,120
because of him.

259
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,360
Aconite is poisonous when
it hasn't been processed.

260
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,320
We must promote such knowledge
and make it common sense

261
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,040
so that people can know about it.

262
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,278
-You see...
-This is delicious.

263
00:13:45,361 --> 00:13:46,920
We grow them

264
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,880
without any pesticides.

265
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,120
We use organic fertilizers
to plant them.

266
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:51,840
Only then,

267
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,480
the herbs can be of excellent quality.

268
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,560
If the herbs we used in Chinese medicine
aren't of the best quality,

269
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,200
the TCM field will be done for.

270
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,960
Don't worry, Professor Ren.

271
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,800
We did everything

272
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,880
according to your guidance.

273
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,480
We didn't dare to slack off.

274
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,717
What do you mean?

275
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,477
Are you saying that
you can do e-commerce

276
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,560
in an isolated place like this?

277
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,280
We have to thank Professor Ren for that.

278
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,040
After Professor Ren came here,

279
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,120
he discovered

280
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,920
that our village is suitable
for growing aconite.

281
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,480
He chose the field for us.

282
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,880
He taught us

283
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,280
how to grow them.

284
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,000
He even contacted online retailers

285
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,040
and advertised for us.

286
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,680
You guys may not believe it,

287
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,360
but many foreigners come here

288
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,240
to purchase herbs from us.

289
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,120
We grow our crops with
all of our hearts.

290
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,157
As long as we ensure the quality
of the herbs,

291
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,717
you guys will render merit as well

292
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,280
when we cure other people
with the herbs you grow.

293
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,920
Our entire village

294
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,157
is very thankful to Professor Ren.

295
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,160
Ever since

296
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,240
we started growing them,

297
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,640
each family

298
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:51,957
has a job to do.

299
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,957
Now, we get paid.

300
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,917
In the past,

301
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,637
only kids and elderly people
stayed here.

302
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,600
All youngsters

303
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,360
would work in the city.

304
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,320
But now, our village is making
good income.

305
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,397
The youngsters came back.

306
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,320
The kids here

307
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,560
can finally spend time
with their parents.

308
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,640
It's just like
what Professor Ren had said.

309
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,880
When you teach a man how to fish...

310
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,560
What was it again?

311
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,120
Better to teach someone to fish

312
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,077
than to give him a fish.

313
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,880
That's right. That's what I meant.

314
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,757
Anyway, Professor Ren

315
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,360
made us rich.

316
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:29,920
Come.

317
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,200
Let's have a toast

318
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,040
with the chicken soup.

319
00:15:33,124 --> 00:15:33,957
-Come.
-Come.

320
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:35,237
-Thank you.
-Thank you, Professor Ren.

321
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,557
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

322
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,480
Thank you.

323
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,720
Has everything been arranged for?

324
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,800
Don't worry.

325
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,357
Do you need any help?

326
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,280
Nope!

327
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,080
Hello.

328
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:02,957
Professor Song.

329
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,720
Welcome.

330
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,557
Sir, thank you

331
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,080
for your arrangement.

332
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,997
You guys are here to provide us
with free training

333
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,357
and medical consultation.

334
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,517
You guys are even donating to us.

335
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,200
We should be the ones
thanking you guys instead.

336
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,640
It's our job.

337
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,957
So, are the teaching assistants

338
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:18,877
the village doctors

339
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,960
we trained last time?

340
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,080
Not just them.

341
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,597
The village doctors from other villages

342
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,080
wish to attend this training too.

343
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,117
We didn't agree to it
as we thought it might be

344
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:26,997
too taxing on you two.

345
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,200
That's fine.

346
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,200
Just let them come.
The more the merrier.

347
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,880
Professor Ren, you had no idea.

348
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,997
The village doctors
you trained last time

349
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,117
have all become famous local doctors.

350
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,920
All of them are very busy now.

351
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,960
However, we still need to continue

352
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,960
providing them with training.

353
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,840
The more village doctors we have,

354
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,800
the better the health condition
of the villagers.

355
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:49,877
Professors, please.

356
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,200
Okay, let's go.

357
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,760
Give me your ID cards.

358
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,600
Tian Zhen, your ID card.

359
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,280
Rebecca,

360
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,600
your ID card.

361
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,040
It's fine. I'll do it myself.

362
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:12,997
You're hiding it from me?

363
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,240
What exactly is your Chinese name?

364
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,960
Don't tell me you're a fugitive?

365
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,600
You need to seek treatment
if you're sick in the head.

366
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,800
Here you go.

367
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,720
Excuse me. I wish to
complete my check-in.

368
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,080
Wait there if you guys are together.

369
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,757
We have a lot of people here today.

370
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,877
Isn't it faster if you help us

371
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,040
with the process too?

372
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,597
You guys are the only ones
staying here today.

373
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,600
Why the rush?

374
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,160
Here, take your ID cards.

375
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,117
One card for each room.

376
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,040
Check your floor number.

377
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,080
Excuse me.

378
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,280
So,

379
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,440
is there only one card for each room?

380
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,200
Do you guys need a power card
for the room?

381
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,360
We do.

382
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,240
This won't do. I need two cards.

383
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:56,837
It's like this.

384
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,320
This is our package.

385
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,717
If you want

386
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,357
to take another room card,

387
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,800
you have to pay an extra 1,000 yuan.

388
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,440
That doesn't make any sense.

389
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,600
Rebecca.

390
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,240
Here, you can stay in this room.

391
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,997
You can use the power

392
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,120
once you insert your credit card.

393
00:18:10,593 --> 00:18:11,638
Excuse me.

394
00:18:11,721 --> 00:18:14,200
You can change the details to hers
for this room.

395
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,637
It's fine. The check-in
has been completed.

396
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,320
You guys can swap the rooms if you like.

397
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,757
I just called the front desk.

398
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,760
Why didn't you pick it up?

399
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,040
It's fine. You're not disturbing me.

400
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,600
What do you mean by that?

401
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,440
I want to change my towel.

402
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,680
I hung this towel

403
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,397
on the back of my chair a few days ago.

404
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,237
You didn't change it at all.

405
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,320
And, I've already put it
in the bathroom sink...

406
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,637
I've already put it

407
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,837
in the bathroom sink.

408
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,320
Even so, no one changed it for me.

409
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,357
Did you hear me?

410
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,437
I want to change my towel.

411
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,800
Each guest only has one towel.

412
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,397
Wait, does that mean

413
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,317
you won't change my towel for me

414
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,960
even if I'm staying here
for half a month?

415
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,597
Look, it's already wet.

416
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,840
I can't use it.

417
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,080
That doesn't matter.

418
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,320
What do you mean by that?

419
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,037
It might not matter to you,

420
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,077
but it matters to me.

421
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,800
I want a change of towel.
You hear me?

422
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,720
Hello, do you need anything?

423
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,637
-Listen.
-It's like this...

424
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,117
My sister-in-law

425
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:39,997
was such a wretch.

426
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,717
-Do you know that?
-No one changed my towel for me.

427
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,717
This is the one.

428
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,077
No one changed it for me

429
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,520
even after all this while. Stop!

430
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,280
Change my towel!

431
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,237
What about this? Give it to me.

432
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,440
I'll change it for you.

433
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,720
No.

434
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,397
Here, each guest

435
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,680
only has one towel.

436
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,640
What about this then?

437
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,357
I'll do my check-out now.

438
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,000
After that, I'll do the check-in again.
Okay?

439
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,440
Does that mean
you can change my towel for me by then?

440
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,960
It's not like I don't know you.

441
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,160
Even if you do your check-out now,

442
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,040
you're still the same person.

443
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,840
Enough. Stop it.

444
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:12,877
Do you guys have washing machines here?

445
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,320
I'll wash it myself, okay?

446
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,680
We don't have washing machines here.

447
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,757
That's not true. We do have them.

448
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,517
It's just that they're
out of commission.

449
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,480
Miss!

450
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,600
Rebecca, you're here too?

451
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,637
We can't use

452
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,877
your washing machines at all.

453
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,920
They're filled with

454
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,357
sweet potatoes and potatoes.

455
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,597
They're all filled up.

456
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,840
We can't use them now.

457
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,957
No one knows how to use

458
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,080
the washing machines.

459
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,957
It's the same whether
we have washing machines or not.

460
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:36,997
Having washing machines but don't know
how to use them is different from

461
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,998
having no washing machines,
alright?

462
00:21:39,081 --> 00:21:40,237
You guys have washing machines here.

463
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,077
But you said there weren't any.

464
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,437
You deceived me, understood?

465
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,357
There's an issue with your attitude.

466
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,757
Enough, Roubecca.
You have washing machines, right?

467
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,837
-Yeah.
-If so,

468
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,837
you should

469
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,837
clean the washing machines

470
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,237
and get rid of the potatoes.

471
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,237
-Okay.
-I'll check them

472
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,317
and see if they're spoiled.

473
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,397
I'll see if we can use them, okay?

474
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,077
No problem. I'll clean it right away.

475
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,357
-Thank you.
-Calm down.

476
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,280
Thank you.

477
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,957
Just ignore them.

478
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,720
City dwellers are always troublesome.

479
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,637
Enough. I'll check it out.

480
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,117
-Thank you.
-Don't mention it.

481
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,120
Go now.

482
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,397
Please hurry up then.

483
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,400
Okay.

484
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,280
Mr Ren.

485
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,877
I don't understand something.
I need your help.

486
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,800
Ask away.

487
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,717
I don't understand

488
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,800
why you come here every year.

489
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,440
Are these people even worth our visit?

490
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:27,960
What's the matter?

491
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,637
I've never seen people

492
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,400
as lazy as them before.

493
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,117
Our nation has paved the road

494
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,600
all the way to their doorsteps.

495
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,597
They're receiving wage

496
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,560
for free.

497
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,997
They have it real easy

498
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,000
out here.

499
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,520
But what do they do every day?

500
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,317
They slack off inside.

501
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,440
They idle around.

502
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,517
Besides scrolling their phones,

503
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,680
they only talk about

504
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,917
meaningless topics

505
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,040
in life.

506
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,920
I don't understand why we must help them

507
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,120
to alleviate poverty when
our targets are acting like that.

508
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,320
What's the point?

509
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,600
Actually,

510
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,640
you were making a hasty generalization.

511
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,400
Many people are working hard

512
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,960
and leading life seriously.

513
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,600
Anyway, I've been here for some time.

514
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,237
At least half of them are
good-for-nothings.

515
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,000
Isn't that enough?

516
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,440
Yang, it's like this.

517
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,240
The same kind of rice

518
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,400
provides for 100 kinds of people.

519
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,880
This is a vast world.

520
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,440
You can't possibly expect

521
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,280
every people to act like you.

522
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,440
-Am I right?
-Master.

523
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,240
Master,

524
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,517
do you want

525
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,517
to do your laundry?

526
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,600
I'll do it for you.

527
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:36,997
It's fine.

528
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:37,877
It's been a few days.

529
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,997
Master, we're here to help
alleviate poverty.

530
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,597
We're not here to provide for the lazy.

531
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,717
In the end, we're just assisting them.

532
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,680
They have to at least
do something, right?

533
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,360
We can't just do everything for them.

534
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,360
Tou Tou, what's your opinion on it?

535
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:54,997
What do you mean?

536
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:55,798
I don't have any opinions.

537
00:23:55,881 --> 00:23:57,880
I'm just asking you if you want
to do your laundry.

538
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,837
You accumulated a lot of dirty laundry.

539
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,480
You won't be able to get changed
if you don't wash them by today.

540
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,157
Let's say some people are very lazy

541
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,360
and they don't do any chores.

542
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,200
Will you get anxious and frustrated?

543
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,197
Everyone has their own personalities.

544
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,277
Why should I get anxious or frustrated?

545
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,357
But I'm anxious about the laundry.

546
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,517
If it rains,

547
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,757
I don't think we can dry them in time.

548
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,000
Do you want to do your laundry or not?

549
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,200
Not for now.

550
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,117
By the way, Roubecca,

551
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,560
I found a new towel in my bag.

552
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,120
I'll get it for you if you want it.

553
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,040
I'm speechless.

554
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,320
You two are...

555
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,840
Yang,

556
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:34,080
sometimes, you should
learn from Tou Tou.

557
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,080
Empty talk harms the nation,

558
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,880
practical action helps it thrive.

559
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,397
Actually, everyone is born

560
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,680
into this world

561
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,320
with their own missions.

562
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,117
Some people might find them

563
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,360
while some might not.

564
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,200
If you found your mission,

565
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,877
you should lend a hand to those

566
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,440
who haven't found it yet.

567
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,277
There's an anthropologist

568
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,880
called Margaret Mead.

569
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,440
She once said

570
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,637
that instead of

571
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,960
fire

572
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,840
or tools,

573
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,200
a healed femur

574
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,720
is the earliest sign

575
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,960
of

576
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,360
human civilization.

577
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,040
What does that mean?

578
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,200
That means humans have compassion.

579
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,840
That we should help the weak.

580
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,357
I'm sure you've read

581
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,760
many books.

582
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,960
I'm sure you have the ability
to think independently

583
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,520
and rationally.

584
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,120
However, you do lack something.

585
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,600
How will Tou Tou describe it?

586
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,160
A human touch.

587
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,840
You lack a human touch.

588
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,157
Mr Ren, I don't think

589
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,920
I lack a human touch.

590
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,957
I just think that we should help those

591
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,240
who are worth helping.

592
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,157
The predecessor you mentioned,

593
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,600
who talked about the healed femur,

594
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,477
she didn't make a living through labour.

595
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,720
She was an intellectual.

596
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,200
Other people couldn't find
their directions if they left her.

597
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,040
Think about it this way.

598
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,000
They might not be lazy.

599
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,040
It might be a deficiency of qi
as stated in TCM.

600
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,280
Didn't Master say this before?

601
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,237
Someone who doesn't want

602
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,117
to move

603
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,400
or do anything

604
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,680
might be experiencing an
imbalance of Yin and Yang, right?

605
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,040
They just don't want to move.

606
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,440
It's an illness. We have to treat it.

607
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,200
We're here to treat them.

608
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,560
I think I'm sick too.

609
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,000
I'm experiencing a deficiency of qi.

610
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,200
I'll take a break first.

611
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,720
Take a break then.

612
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,600
Are you doing your laundry or not?

613
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,040
No.

614
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,157
You're so dirty.

615
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,320
Goodness.

616
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,640
Do you know how many days it has been
since you did your laundry?

617
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,440
Miss,

618
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,037
regarding the methods
to use the washing machine,

619
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,877
I've labelled them

620
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,960
as Step One to Five.

621
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,957
By then, just follow these instructions.

622
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,360
I'm sure the washing machines
will work fine.

623
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,117
You can paste this on the front desk

624
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,080
and check it out every day.

625
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,360
This...

626
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,120
Can I even learn this?

627
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,757
Why not?

628
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,357
You can learn this
as long as you can read.

629
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,840
I've already written everything down.

630
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,080
Isn't it clear enough?

631
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,000
Little girl,

632
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,837
let me be honest with you.

633
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,237
I'm working here

634
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,557
because this job is easy

635
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,840
and not troublesome.

636
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,440
If I use this washing machine,

637
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,080
I have to be responsible for it.

638
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,960
That's so troublesome.

639
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,360
Last time, I got myself into trouble.

640
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,320
I climbed a ladder to clean the window.

641
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,197
But I slipped

642
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,120
and fell.

643
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,120
I got a fracture because of that.

644
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,237
Since then,

645
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,200
I thought to myself

646
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,757
that it didn't matter

647
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,920
whether I cleaned the window or not.

648
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,397
I broke my leg

649
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,680
because I wanted to do something,
you know?

650
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,840
-That's right.
-That's right.

651
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,040
You do have a point.

652
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,397
Are you trying to PUA
(psychological manipulate) me here?

653
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,237
What's that again?

654
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,280
PUA?

655
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,920
Just do the laundry.

656
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,040
This...

657
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,680
This is so troublesome.

658
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,600
This tool is great, right?

659
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,840
Yeah, this is great.

660
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,837
You can reach it no matter

661
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,797
how tall it is.

662
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,637
-Yeah.
-Am I right?

663
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,637
And, you just need to change the cloth

664
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,717
if you wish to rinse it.

665
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,600
It's very convenient.

666
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,760
Am I right?

667
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,560
And, it's clean too, right?

668
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,800
It's nice, right?

669
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,320
-What do you think?
-It's great.

670
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,037
It's convenient and easy to use.

671
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,200
-Yeah.
-You can even clean the corners.

672
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:33,880
Yeah.

673
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,400
It looks brand new now.

674
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,797
I was treating

675
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,237
their spine issues.

676
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,320
I told them

677
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,837
that their spines will
definitely get better

678
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,440
if they do this for
half an hour every day.

679
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,760
You're right.

680
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,997
If you do this for half an hour

681
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,080
to one hour every day,

682
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,080
your spine will recover.

683
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,080
Yang,

684
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,720
you're good at discovering issues.

685
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,520
That's outstanding.

686
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,560
However, it's even more outstanding

687
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,720
if you can resolve the issues.

688
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,240
You chose to ignore them.

689
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,757
You chose to starve them

690
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,680
as punishment.

691
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,120
If that's the case,

692
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,360
they'll be even lazier.

693
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,600
No matter who acts first,

694
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,120
the stalemate will be changed.

695
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,840
(Steps for Using The Washing Machine)

696
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,637
This won't do.

697
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,600
Slow down.

698
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,117
My body is still too weak.

699
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,756
-It's like this at first.
-I'm so sweaty.

700
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,920
You see, when you move,
Yang energy will be generated.

701
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,037
It'll be obvious
once you get used to it.

702
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,000
Let me do it.

703
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:43,960
-Thank you.
-Take a break.

704
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,160
Here I go.

705
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,640
Take a break. It's fine.

706
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,800
Who grew these?

707
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,320
They're growing so much.

708
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,557
They should stop growing.

709
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,997
If so, my herbs

710
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,040
will be done for.

711
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,837
Don't worry. Leave it to me.

712
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,440
I won't cause trouble for you.

713
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,840
Look at all these fruits.

714
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,797
Look, it looks drained.

715
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,637
Over here.

716
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,560
This place. That's right.

717
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,120
Does it look nice?

718
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,600
It grew well.

719
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,200
It's all thanks to Tou Tou.

720
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,800
How did you know?

721
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,080
What are you doing?

722
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,720
You saw it when I spit the pit out?

723
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,040
I know everything you do.

724
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,080
Did you install a surveillance camera?

725
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,280
Can I try one?

726
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,640
No.

727
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,080
There's a rotten one.

728
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,840
Remove it.

729
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,360
Meng Meng, do you want to try?

730
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,400
Come here.

731
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,400
Yes, tie it here.

732
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,200
Cross it over. Here.

733
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,320
That's right.

734
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:29,640
(Major Snow doesn't necessarily mean
that snow will increase significantly.)

735
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,800
(It means that the weather
will get colder.)

736
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:39,000
(It's popular for people
to consume red date cakes)

737
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,520
(and enjoy the freezing of rivers.)

738
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,200
(Major Snow)

739
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,040
When the professor is here,

740
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,120
you guys must greet him.

741
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,160
Did you hear me?

742
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,520
Professor.

743
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,277
Sorry for the trouble.

744
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,397
Long time no see.

745
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,997
-Yeah.
-I need to seek your help again.

746
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,320
No problem. What is it?

747
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,400
It's like this.

748
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,760
This is my son.

749
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,080
Come and greet the professor.

750
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,080
Your son is all grown up.

751
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,840
(Liu Zi Hong)
Greet him!

752
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,400
Liu,

753
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,400
you're elder than me.

754
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,400
He can call me uncle.

755
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,120
-Hello, Uncle.
-Hello.

756
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,360
What's the matter?

757
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,880
This child has encountered some issues.

758
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:40,997
I hope you can

759
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:41,920
give him

760
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,560
a medical certificate of depression.

761
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,640
-Depression?
-I'm not sick.

762
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,560
Liu, what's the matter?

763
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,680
Don't misunderstand me.
He's not depressed for real.

764
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,960
It's like this.

765
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,557
My son's result

766
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,600
was pretty good.

767
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,237
Although he can't get into Harvard

768
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,157
or Stanford,

769
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,637
he has no issues getting into

770
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,757
the top 30 universities in the world.

771
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,797
He'll be taking the college
entrance exam next year.

772
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,160
But he said he wanted
to drop out of school this year.

773
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,357
He wishes to be a...

774
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,037
What was it again?

775
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,157
An idol trainee.

776
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,280
I'm going to make a debut as an idol.

777
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,320
You see?

778
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:17,477
He wants to be an idol trainee.

779
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,400
Is he your son?

780
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,600
You want to join a talent show?

781
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,920
I have infinite potential.

782
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,760
It's worth it if you invest in me.

783
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,360
Look at him.

784
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,997
Look, he's all fired up

785
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,960
when we talk about that.

786
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,317
I started getting into street dance
when I was in junior high.

787
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,520
You just had no idea.

788
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:34,560
What's the matter?

789
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,757
He wants me to give him

790
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,797
a medical certificate of depression.

791
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,717
You're getting ahead
of yourself, aren't you?

792
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,040
-Have you lost your mind?
-A medical certificate?

793
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,600
Professor, it's like this.
This kid doesn't even

794
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,040
want to attend school now.

795
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,157
I'm just trying to think of a way

796
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,677
to apply for a semester break

797
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,440
for him.

798
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,560
You get me?
Once his three-minute passion is over,

799
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,120
at least he can return to school.

800
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,560
If not, his future will be ruined.

801
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,997
How could you bear to let the child

802
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,160
not graduate from high school?

803
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,040
That won't do.

804
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,600
Can you stop that?

805
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,637
Liu, calm down.

806
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,000
-Wait.
-Come, have a seat.

807
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,117
Please do me this favour.

808
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,077
Stop that.

809
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,040
You see,

810
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,400
I'll ask the child first.

811
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,280
Keep quiet for now.

812
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,320
Why are you pulling them out?
You're so inconsiderate.

813
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,560
Boy,

814
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,477
come here.

815
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,600
Come here.

816
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,960
Boy, what's your name?

817
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,000
My name is Liu Zi Hong.

818
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,400
Liu Zi Hong? That's a great name.

819
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,837
I wish to ask you something.

820
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,800
Have you decided to be an idol?

821
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,680
That's right.

822
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,077
Have you ever thought of this?

823
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,440
Say, what if

824
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,237
you weren't selected,

825
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,400
or what if you lost

826
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,320
after being selected?

827
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,320
What do you plan to do

828
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,760
in the future then?

829
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,920
We can talk about it
after I get selected.

830
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,240
If we don't do it, that means
there's no possibility at all.

831
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,520
If I give it a try,

832
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,440
even if I fail this time,

833
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,640
I'll try again next year.

834
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,320
Look at him.

835
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,120
Liu, calm down.

836
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,880
I know you've done me a lot of favours.

837
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,077
This is the only thing

838
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,600
I can help you out professionally.

839
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,600
I know you're doing this
for your son's sake.

840
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,920
However,

841
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,840
I cannot

842
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,160
help you out this time.

843
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,600
Do you think

844
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,080
that I'm asking you to
forge the certificate?

845
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,640
That's not it.

846
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:27,877
He's mentally unstable

847
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,120
for having such thoughts.

848
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,480
If this continues,

849
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,317
I'll get depressed before him.

850
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,240
Liu,

851
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:34,680
you see,

852
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,797
I've never really

853
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,877
tried to understand street dance

854
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,120
or talent shows.

855
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,080
What about this? Tou Tou.

856
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,597
Let's hear what Tou Tou has to say.

857
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,160
It's okay

858
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,280
as long as Tou Tou thinks it's fine.

859
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,240
Me?

860
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,880
You're one of

861
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,080
the successors too.

862
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,320
But Master, he...

863
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,880
Yeah, we should listen to her.

864
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,400
She...

865
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,477
This concerns my son's future.

866
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,317
Professor,

867
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,997
you want a kid like her
to decide his future?

868
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,757
Don't you think this joke
has gone too far?

869
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:07,040
They're masters of their own lives.

870
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,637
We can't just

871
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,120
always treat them like kids.

872
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,600
Now, we're here

873
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,077
to supervise them

874
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,680
while they discuss their opinions.

875
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,840
Isn't that good?

876
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,120
Tou Tou,

877
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,240
tell us what you think.

878
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,440
Do you really wish to be a dancer?

879
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,520
Of course.

880
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,797
I acted as a prince
ever since I was in kindergarten.

881
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,160
Since young, I have always
been at the centre of the stage.

882
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,397
And, I need to join

883
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,397
the hottest talent show.

884
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,120
I will make my debut
as the centre member.

885
00:37:38,573 --> 00:37:39,862
I'll go even if it means
he'll break my legs.

886
00:37:39,946 --> 00:37:41,157
I'll break your legs right now!

887
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,160
Mr Liu,

888
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,997
we know

889
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,237
that you've done us plenty of favours.

890
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,560
And, you were nice to us too.

891
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,237
However,

892
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,277
we can repay the favour

893
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,717
in another way.

894
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,397
For example, we can monitor your health

895
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,280
and take care of you when you're old.

896
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,240
As for the medical certificate,

897
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,800
I don't think it'll work.

898
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,680
As for why,

899
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,077
you see, no one can predict

900
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,560
the future.

901
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,200
Even if we do give him
the medical certificate,

902
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,637
at most it'll last for one year.

903
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,000
What if your son

904
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,120
returns to school within that period?

905
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,800
What if he gets into
a top local university?

906
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,837
Won't this medical certificate

907
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,200
affect his future then?

908
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,117
What if he wants to be a civil servant

909
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,840
on a whim?

910
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,077
I'm sure this medical certificate

911
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,397
will affect his result.

912
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,317
What do you think?

913
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,640
Dad, did you hear that?

914
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,880
I think

915
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,560
it's not suitable for you
to join a talent show.

916
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:34,920
Go on.

917
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,920
I think it's not suitable

918
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,160
for the time being.

919
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:41,877
You'll be taking
the college entrance exam

920
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:42,920
by next year.

921
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,640
I think there's no need to rush.

922
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,877
After the exam,

923
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:46,760
you can choose

924
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,757
a university

925
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,917
that provides courses
that are related to your hobby.

926
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,957
Once you get into a university,

927
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:50,837
you can do

928
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,120
whatever you want to do.

929
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,797
If so, I won't be able to
make it this year.

930
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,598
-That doesn't matter.
-Yeah.

931
00:38:55,681 --> 00:38:56,797
It does matter.

932
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,757
I want to make my debut this year.

933
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:58,720
Look at you.

934
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,560
Right now, you're restless
and impatient.

935
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,517
You have a short temper,

936
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,880
kid.

937
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,120
I don't suggest you

938
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,440
join the talent show this year.

939
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,680
In your current state of mind,

940
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:11,920
you cannot withstand pressure.

941
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,160
You have to adjust your state of mind

942
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,680
and establish a solid foothold.

943
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,800
You can go once

944
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,880
your body and qi are well-regulated.

945
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,480
You'll definitely win by then.

946
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,440
Did you hear him?

947
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:26,840
The professor is right.

948
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:27,797
You might not like dancing

949
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,197
by next year.

950
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,117
By then, you can study
financial management.

951
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,037
Am I right?

952
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,520
Just you wish.

953
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,040
I will never

954
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,237
lead my life

955
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,440
according to your plan.

956
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,757
Brat, if you're that capable,

957
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,797
don't spend my money then.

958
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,757
No, I won't then.

959
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,800
-You said so yourself!
-Master.

960
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,397
Before this, you told me

961
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,480
about the word "destiny".

962
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,720
That's right.

963
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,640
Mr Liu,

964
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,200
you have a great son.

965
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,797
He found his own destiny

966
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,960
at such a young age.

967
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,040
He loves his hobby passionately,

968
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,720
and he works hard on it.

969
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,840
I have a suggestion.

970
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,117
You can apply to your school

971
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,160
for a break.

972
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,277
You can retain your qualifications

973
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,320
and chase your dream.

974
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:14,960
Mr Liu,

975
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,877
you need to be open-minded.

976
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,077
It's common for youngsters

977
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,077
to chase their dreams.

978
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,760
And, it's a positive thing.

979
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,277
Look at him.

980
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,560
He's hard-working
when it comes to dancing.

981
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,397
He might win a prize

982
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,400
and be the next dancing champion.

983
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,160
He might become popular in an instant.

984
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,440
By then,

985
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,440
if people

986
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,600
hear about this medical certificate,

987
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,037
all eyes

988
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:33,920
will be on him.

989
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,757
It'll be too late to regret it by then.

990
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,597
Do you know what will happen?

991
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,800
His reputation will be ruined.

992
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:39,797
It's very serious.

993
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:40,800
Liu,

994
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,197
Tou Tou made

995
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,920
a great point, right?

996
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,560
Tou Tou,

997
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,677
you've impressed me once again.

998
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,197
Liu, have a seat.

999
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:53,880
Let's do what Tou Tou said, okay?

1000
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,760
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

1001
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,160
(are referenced from relevant
traditional Chinese medicine books)
