00:01:30,563 --> 00:01:34,796
(Gen Z)

2
00:01:35,594 --> 00:01:37,375
(Episode 31)

3
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,341
To work for the benefit of others
and for the benefit of society,

4
00:01:42,901 --> 00:01:45,501
if your heart is in the right place,

5
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,422
you'll be able to bring together
all the forces from all directions

6
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:49,980
to make things happen.

7
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,860
That's why there is this saying,

8
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,300
"unity is strength".

9
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,140
So, if a person thinks of

10
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,581
getting something out of this guy

11
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,620
and something out of that guy every day,

12
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:05,941
his heart is not in the right place,

13
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,060
so he can't do a good job.

14
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,741
Even if he can,

15
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,180
he will need to pay in double.

16
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:18,781
Master.

17
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:22,700
Well, I have a friend.

18
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,621
Previously, she has had this

19
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:26,941
impure

20
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,660
and thoughts for personal gain.

21
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,141
But it so happened that
her wishes are fulfilled.

22
00:02:33,141 --> 00:02:33,901
What should she do?

23
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:37,340
You should do more good deeds then

24
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,380
to slowly repay it,

25
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:39,740
but provided that

26
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,420
you can't be too wrong.

27
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,661
How do you know it's me?

28
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,661
No, it's not me.

29
00:02:47,981 --> 00:02:48,780
I know.

30
00:02:48,941 --> 00:02:49,780
It's my friend.

31
00:02:50,621 --> 00:02:52,941
I'm doomed!

32
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,021
I keep thinking about it and...

33
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,061
And this time,
Meng Meng asked me for help.

34
00:02:58,941 --> 00:03:00,180
But I missed it.

35
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:04,301
If I keep losing points like this,

36
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,460
I can't be a TCM practitioner?

37
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,180
You can.

38
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,220
Can I?

39
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,941
It's just that you're
not very skilled in treating patients.

40
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,740
That doesn't work either.

41
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,100
Look, a brilliant doctor

42
00:03:20,061 --> 00:03:21,740
is someone virtuous.

43
00:03:23,341 --> 00:03:26,420
That's to say,
many people are grateful to him.

44
00:03:27,301 --> 00:03:31,621
The more this gratitude is gathered.

45
00:03:31,621 --> 00:03:32,740
it'll become like...

46
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,420
The legs of compasses.

47
00:03:36,621 --> 00:03:38,740
It will get longer

48
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,941
and the circle will become bigger.

49
00:03:41,941 --> 00:03:44,460
Thus, more people are covered.

50
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,141
He's not like the inexperienced doctor
like you who has short legs.

51
00:03:47,901 --> 00:03:49,820
Take your time. You'll get better.

52
00:04:09,901 --> 00:04:11,460
I feel tasteless.

53
00:04:13,261 --> 00:04:16,660
How great it'd be
if there's a piece of cake to eat.

54
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:24,580
It's been a while since the last time
we celebrate a happy occasion.

55
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,221
Why doesn't anyone have a birthday?

56
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:35,740
There seems to be someone in our family
who hasn't celebrated a birthday yet.

57
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,580
Tou Tou.

58
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:42,421
Grandpa.

59
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:46,100
I want
the chestnut cake with thick cream.

60
00:04:46,341 --> 00:04:48,341
Tou Tou should be choosing the cake
since it's her birthday.

61
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,901
Let's not tell her first.
Let's surprise her.

62
00:04:52,061 --> 00:04:53,540
She grew up in a welfare home.

63
00:04:53,621 --> 00:04:56,501
She doesn't even know when
her birthday is. How is she celebrating?

64
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,180
The more she needs to celebrate it.

65
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,981
This is a philosophical proposition.

66
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,180
Humans need to know

67
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,180
where they come from and where they go,

68
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,901
if they are materialistic or idealistic.

69
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:08,421
Alright.

70
00:05:08,861 --> 00:05:11,020
We've decided then.

71
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,300
Aren't we going to make
rice wine in two days?

72
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,660
Order the cake as well.

73
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,580
Chestnut cake with thick cream.

74
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:20,901
Grandpa.

75
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,100
You are trying to kill me.

76
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,820
If I really order that cake,

77
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,020
my mom and grandma
will play women's doubles

78
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:29,460
and push me to the ground
and beat me repeatedly?

79
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,380
Well, I keep you little thing

80
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:36,380
just so that
you can take the beatings for me.

81
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,740
Okay, Grandpa.

82
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,261
Thick cream, okay?

83
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,700
By the way, Master, that...

84
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,020
Have you watched Meng Meng's video?

85
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,700
What do you have in mind?

86
00:06:01,821 --> 00:06:02,700
It's all in the past.

87
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,980
Let Meng Meng rest in peace.

88
00:06:07,661 --> 00:06:08,941
I think...

89
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:12,101
I think no matter what,

90
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,821
we should show it to her parents.

91
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:18,101
I think they
have misunderstood their daughter.

92
00:06:18,941 --> 00:06:21,020
Who knows? It might be pathological.

93
00:06:22,661 --> 00:06:23,740
Look, in the end,

94
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,101
a girl like her

95
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,420
walked away with shame.

96
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,341
We didn't care about her.

97
00:06:32,221 --> 00:06:35,700
I just feel that it's quite...

98
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,980
Those were Meng Meng's last words.

99
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,420
She wrote to you.

100
00:06:50,381 --> 00:06:51,700
It's her trust in you.

101
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:54,180
I think

102
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,300
let's not tell her parents.

103
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:03,101
If her parents know what she did
was because of her illness,

104
00:07:05,941 --> 00:07:07,541
they will regret it forever.

105
00:07:08,941 --> 00:07:10,941
So, let's not do things like this.

106
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:12,901
In the end,

107
00:07:13,661 --> 00:07:15,661
we just hope that those who are alive

108
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,180
live better.

109
00:07:22,941 --> 00:07:24,020
Those who are alive live better.

110
00:07:30,621 --> 00:07:31,860
Drink some dried tangerine peel.

111
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,980
Why did you drag me here?

112
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,980
I want to confess something to you.

113
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,381
What bad thing did you do?

114
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,580
Your dad said this.

115
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,980
We can't simply wish for something

116
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,860
and have it come true.

117
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,180
If we do that, we will be punished.

118
00:08:10,821 --> 00:08:13,420
Does my dad need to tell you this?
Animated cartoons have taught us.

119
00:08:14,101 --> 00:08:15,460
For example, in "Lao Mountain Taoist",

120
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,541
and "The Story of the Goldfish
and the Farmer", it's in these cartoons.

121
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,221
Actually, I came here

122
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,860
half of it is because of money.

123
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,781
The other half is because...

124
00:08:29,661 --> 00:08:30,300
Because of what?

125
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:33,501
Because I want to court you.

126
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,020
Such a bold idea.

127
00:08:41,101 --> 00:08:42,621
How could you have this thought?

128
00:08:42,821 --> 00:08:44,821
And you even succeeded.

129
00:08:44,821 --> 00:08:46,020
That's right!

130
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,700
I didn't know it would come true.

131
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,460
And why would
your dad pass this down to me?

132
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,260
I didn't know it was so powerful.

133
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,300
Looks like you've gotten
my dad's handed-down teachings.

134
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:58,061
You've ruined my life.

135
00:08:58,061 --> 00:09:00,020
-You'll have to pay back.
-I will pay you back.

136
00:09:00,221 --> 00:09:00,941
How are you going to pay?

137
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:03,661
Let me.

138
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:08,580
How are you going to pay?

139
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,460
Break up.

140
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,140
What?

141
00:09:25,061 --> 00:09:25,941
Break up.

142
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:27,541
That's impossible.

143
00:09:28,821 --> 00:09:31,381
How could you return it
when your wish has come true?

144
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,260
I must return this.

145
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:38,260
The wishes I want to make
are very precious.

146
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,300
And I want to use it
in Chinese medicine.

147
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,420
All the merits
I have accumulated so hard

148
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,740
are all gone because of this.

149
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,860
It's not worth it at all.

150
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,420
Please understand me.

151
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,061
I feel very bad, really.

152
00:09:49,101 --> 00:09:50,821
I'm being torn too.

153
00:09:50,821 --> 00:09:52,661
But there's nothing I can do.

154
00:09:52,661 --> 00:09:53,700
Starting now,

155
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:54,980
let's just

156
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,061
pretend nothing has happened, okay?

157
00:09:58,661 --> 00:09:59,300
Sun Tou Tou.

158
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,821
Who do you take me for?

159
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:06,460
You haven't learned my father's skills,
but you've become like him.

160
00:10:06,821 --> 00:10:09,700
I never understood why my mom
was always angry with my dad.

161
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,661
But I understand now.

162
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,580
Whenever there is a conflict
about Chinese medicine,

163
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,460
my mom will be the one
who is sacrificed.

164
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,181
Your dad has said this.

165
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,541
-Willing...
-No.

166
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,260
You can't do this.

167
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,500
Like me at this second and then
doesn't like me in the next second.

168
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:25,060
But we'll only get something
if we let go of others.

169
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,820
Confucius also said that

170
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,700
humans can do anything they like
as long as they don't break the rules.

171
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,661
Ask your heart.

172
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,500
Do you want to let me go or get me?

173
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,301
I don't know!

174
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,020
I know.

175
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,301
It's easy.

176
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:44,140
Just put your mind
into Chinese medicine.

177
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,260
As for our matter,

178
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,620
let me get an idea about it.

179
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,341
Let me think about it.

180
00:10:55,901 --> 00:10:56,940
What does this mean?

181
00:10:58,341 --> 00:10:59,140
I'm getting an idea.

182
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,820
You should do this.

183
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:09,981
Alright.

184
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,580
The merits I accumulated
over the past twenty years

185
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:16,060
is used on our matter.

186
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:16,981
You're still mine.

187
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,901
What about the merits you
accumulate for the rest of your life?

188
00:11:24,901 --> 00:11:27,620
I'll keep it for my
other favorite things in the future.

189
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,901
Hey, decency is no joke.

190
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,460
I said "favorite things",
not "favorite person".

191
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,620
What are you worried about?

192
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,700
I guess it's becoming a good doctor.

193
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:43,901
Me too.

194
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,020
Bingo.

195
00:12:22,021 --> 00:12:25,247
(Autumn heralds the end of summer.)

196
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,120
(Beware of the "autumn tiger",

197
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:29,317
the interim season of sweltering heat
before the temperatures plummet.)

198
00:12:30,091 --> 00:12:34,083
(When the weather is turning cold,

199
00:12:35,146 --> 00:12:38,833
the crops begin to ripen as well.)

200
00:12:43,618 --> 00:12:46,735
(Beginning of Autumn)

201
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,820
Come, come. Have a seat.

202
00:13:02,901 --> 00:13:03,700
Zhao.

203
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:07,020
You've been here for three months.

204
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,460
-Yes.
-How do you feel?

205
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,260
At first, I didn't know how to do it.

206
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,580
But I'm good at it now.

207
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,820
Colleagues treat me well.

208
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:16,940
Look at you.

209
00:13:17,341 --> 00:13:20,260
A talented student after all!
Your learning ability is different.

210
00:13:22,221 --> 00:13:26,181
Mr. Wu really gave us a good person.

211
00:13:27,341 --> 00:13:28,341
Thank you, sir.

212
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,500
Zhao, I asked for you today

213
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,380
because I have something
to ask for your help.

214
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,541
Ask for my help?

215
00:13:36,341 --> 00:13:38,020
Sir, how can I help you?

216
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,260
Take a seat.

217
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,500
You can do it.

218
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,580
Take it easy.

219
00:13:43,661 --> 00:13:45,341
I'm not asking you to blow up bunkers.

220
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,541
Recently,

221
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,700
we've gotten the batch number of
that batch of new medicine for the flu.

222
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,341
You know of this, right?

223
00:13:52,901 --> 00:13:53,940
Yes.

224
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,861
My first task was this medicine.

225
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,140
I won't say much about
the general information.

226
00:13:58,940 --> 00:13:59,741
Well, it's like this.

227
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:00,820
The company

228
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,861
wants to push
for this medicine this year.

229
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,060
It's best if it can be
in the standing medicine list

230
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,101
of the tertiary hospitals in the city.

231
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:12,020
According to the process, tenders
will be carried out in each hospital.

232
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:14,341
And we're about
to put out the tender.

233
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,580
So, what I mean is,

234
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,140
I want to ask Mr. Wu for help

235
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,140
and see if he can reveal

236
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,341
other companies'

237
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,341
base price.

238
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:27,940
Look.

239
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,901
You're Mr. Wu's disciple
and recommended by him.

240
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,700
Go and talk to him

241
00:14:34,341 --> 00:14:35,380
about this.

242
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,020
Sir.

243
00:14:38,341 --> 00:14:40,820
I don't know Mr. Wu very well.

244
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,140
It's not suitable for me
to talk about this.

245
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:43,781
It's suitable.

246
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,060
It's suitable.

247
00:14:50,341 --> 00:14:52,500
This is our tender.

248
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:55,901
And this.

249
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,020
Bring this along for Mr. Wu.

250
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,940
What does this mean?

251
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,380
This card is issued in your name.

252
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:09,341
The password
are the last six digits of your ID.

253
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:10,901
Send this to him.

254
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,341
He just needs to spend it.

255
00:15:13,341 --> 00:15:15,940
The amount here is not the final amount.

256
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,500
As long as Mr. Wu wants,

257
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:20,580
he can just name a figure
and you just let me know.

258
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,661
A card issued in my name?

259
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:25,380
That's right.

260
00:15:28,221 --> 00:15:29,020
Zhao.

261
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,700
Take it easy.

262
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,580
You're just a messenger for us.

263
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,421
If he is okay,

264
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,620
then everyone will be happy.

265
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,181
If he's not okay,

266
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,500
you just return the card to me.

267
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,580
This has nothing to do with you.

268
00:15:44,341 --> 00:15:45,221
But

269
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,620
if you manage to do this,

270
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,020
the sales from the hospitals,

271
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,060
I'll give you one point.

272
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,781
As for how much this one point is,

273
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,661
I guess you don't need me

274
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,741
to calculate for you, right?

275
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,460
Mr. Wu.

276
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:12,020
There are many
skilled physicians in our center.

277
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,820
Why did you choose
Tou Tou who hasn't graduated?

278
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:18,020
Well, I think Tou Tou is good.

279
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,341
Moreover, you're doing business here.

280
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,020
I can't take away the spots from others.

281
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:23,741
You're right.

282
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:31,341
Hero, please be merciful.

283
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:35,700
You have a lot of strength
but my body is soft.

284
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,620
It's still a bit lacking.

285
00:16:37,901 --> 00:16:39,260
Don't worry, Senior.

286
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,221
I will hold back

287
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,060
when I massage you

288
00:16:43,221 --> 00:16:44,781
I won't put in a lot of strength.

289
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,341
If you think I'm doing well today,

290
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,221
please compliment me
in front of Ms. Dong.

291
00:16:50,341 --> 00:16:52,221
I want to officially do this too.

292
00:16:52,781 --> 00:16:53,580
What now?

293
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:56,901
Consultation with your master
doesn't make money?

294
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,260
I'm not doing this for money.

295
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,140
I'm doing this to gain
more length for the compasses.

296
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,101
You know about compasses legs too?

297
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,460
Do you know
where this theory came from?

298
00:17:05,661 --> 00:17:06,380
I don't know.

299
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,901
Anyway, Master told me that.

300
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:09,221
It sounds reasonable to me.

301
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:13,820
He got that theory from me.

302
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,140
How could he do that?

303
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,140
What he learns from you,
he applies to me.

304
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,341
Well, we're juniors and seniors.

305
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:23,460
That's true though.

306
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,380
Senior.

307
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,301
So to speak,

308
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,901
your legs are longer.

309
00:17:30,901 --> 00:17:32,260
You're great.

310
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,221
Don't flatter me.

311
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,620
I know how long my legs are.

312
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,260
Let's get down to business.

313
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:42,940
Between prescribing and acupuncture
and Tuina,

314
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,260
which one do you prefer?

315
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:53,500
Well, it's hard for me to decide

316
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,500
because I think each has its own fun.

317
00:17:55,781 --> 00:17:56,940
They have their good.

318
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,741
I actually like all of these.

319
00:17:59,981 --> 00:18:01,221
Just like Ms. Dong.

320
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,181
She uses her hands
to change her patients

321
00:18:03,181 --> 00:18:05,060
to their old self,
which is before getting the illness.

322
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,741
Don't you think it's amazing?

323
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,380
That's true though.

324
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,020
Is the strength good enough?

325
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,541
Okay.

326
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:14,901
-It's very good.
-Tou Tou.

327
00:18:14,901 --> 00:18:16,460
This gentleman insists on coming to you.

328
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,341
Dr. Sun.

329
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,620
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

330
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,700
Why did you come here?

331
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,981
I went to the center.
They said you're here.

332
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,060
-So, I came here.
-Go look for Tian Zhen.

333
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,500
Let him check on you. I'm busy.

334
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,820
No, Dr. Sun, listen to me.

335
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,341
I have sleepless nights.

336
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:31,541
I just want to hear you talk.
Your words can make me de-stress.

337
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,700
I don't need any acupuncture treatments.

338
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,901
I want to chat with you too,
but look, I'm busy.

339
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,101
Listen to me.

340
00:18:37,341 --> 00:18:38,980
I don't mind
other people listen to us, okay?

341
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,860
But they don't like to listen to you.

342
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,980
-You...
-It's okay, Tou Tou.

343
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,980
You guys have a chat.
I'll just take a nap.

344
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,020
You can ignore me.

345
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,061
Look.

346
00:18:51,181 --> 00:18:53,020
-Have a nap first.
-Sure.

347
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,941
What's wrong with you?

348
00:18:57,461 --> 00:18:58,860
I filed for bankruptcy.

349
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,541
The bank is now taking the inventory.

350
00:19:00,581 --> 00:19:02,941
I'll follow their instructions
on what to do next.

351
00:19:05,581 --> 00:19:07,500
Bankrupt?

352
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:10,100
That means,
the tens of billions are gone.

353
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:10,901
Yes, they're gone.

354
00:19:12,581 --> 00:19:13,821
You're doomed then!

355
00:19:13,821 --> 00:19:16,380
You'll be beaten by those old men
and women when you go out!

356
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,740
Well, they don't recognize me.

357
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,260
Probably it would happen
to the celebrity who endorsed it.

358
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,821
-You're such a sinister.
-I'm not.

359
00:19:23,461 --> 00:19:24,620
Before the celebrity was endorsed,

360
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,260
he didn't know you were a liar.

361
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,301
How could you do this?

362
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,740
My master is right.

363
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,461
Some money is not meant for us.

364
00:19:32,581 --> 00:19:34,100
No, I'm not a liar.

365
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,860
I wanted to invest through this and
give the ordinary people a good return.

366
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:37,860
What did I do wrong?

367
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,301
You invested in things
that you don't know!

368
00:19:39,461 --> 00:19:40,620
And you still have the nerve to say it!

369
00:19:40,821 --> 00:19:42,620
When things were good, they were good.

370
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,901
But things are bad now.
Tell me, what can I do?

371
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:50,860
Let me tell you.

372
00:19:52,821 --> 00:19:54,340
Things have come to this.

373
00:19:54,701 --> 00:19:57,581
This is the bottom
of the valley, isn't it?

374
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,661
You just

375
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,701
relax and have a good sleep.

376
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,740
Well, there's another thing.

377
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,380
I feel uneasy now.

378
00:20:09,701 --> 00:20:10,860
Why?

379
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,781
I still have a sum of money overseas.

380
00:20:15,821 --> 00:20:16,620
Listen.

381
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,860
When the business was good,

382
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,941
I transferred some one after another.

383
00:20:20,941 --> 00:20:22,701
I thought that if I run away,

384
00:20:22,701 --> 00:20:24,100
at least, I still have a business.

385
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:27,620
I'm just not sure about
what should be done right now.

386
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,020
I can keep quiet about it.

387
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:29,781
But you know what?

388
00:20:29,821 --> 00:20:31,500
When I close my eyes at night,

389
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:35,140
I see all the old men and women
blocking me at the company.

390
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,941
I feel bad.

391
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,260
I can't bear the thought of it.

392
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,541
You said I fell sick
because of a guilty conscience.

393
00:20:42,581 --> 00:20:44,020
I thought you were spot on.

394
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,340
You were right.

395
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:46,740
Tell me.

396
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,461
If I leave like this,

397
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,340
will this disease stay with me forever?

398
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:56,740
Lu, the bold one.

399
00:20:58,941 --> 00:21:01,100
My master once told me this.

400
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,181
He said humans have a debt

401
00:21:03,461 --> 00:21:04,581
which is not in the bank.

402
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:05,781
It's in the sky.

403
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,740
You think you've hidden the debt.

404
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,941
You think people don't know about it.

405
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,860
But this debt

406
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:14,740
has been following you.

407
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,100
You can't run away from it.

408
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,220
Do you know

409
00:21:18,581 --> 00:21:19,500
the character "kui"(ashamed)?

410
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,714
It's formed from a radical heart
and the character "gui"(spirit).

411
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,220
Right? There's a spirit in your heart.

412
00:21:24,461 --> 00:21:27,020
Someone with ulterior motives
has a grim expression.

413
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:30,421
He'll have a weak body,
thus suffering a lot of diseases.

414
00:21:32,701 --> 00:21:33,740
If

415
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,260
you go abroad

416
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,301
because of the money

417
00:21:39,581 --> 00:21:42,020
and don't return the money
to the investors,

418
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,860
then you can never come back again.

419
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,840
You will die abroad

420
00:21:46,857 --> 00:21:48,627
and it's hard to see
your parents and friends again.

421
00:21:48,821 --> 00:21:50,821
It'll be like this
for the rest of your life.

422
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,181
Are you willing to pay such a price

423
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,421
for this money?

424
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,620
Ask your heart.

425
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:03,301
Well, I'm born evil.

426
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:07,020
If I were to take out all my property,

427
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:09,340
I would feel reluctant.

428
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,821
Do you know the Yinzhi lines?

429
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:15,980
-Yinzhi lines.
-What lines?

430
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,701
So, when you're smiling,

431
00:22:18,941 --> 00:22:20,701
there are three lines at this spot.

432
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,100
You have these lines.

433
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,980
-I have them?
-Yes. Just smile.

434
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:26,100
-Go back and look in the mirror.
-Okay.

435
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,260
These three lines.

436
00:22:27,821 --> 00:22:29,100
Okay. So, Yinzhi lines

437
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,860
will only appear on the descendants

438
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,821
if the ancestors
have accumulated a lot of merits.

439
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,620
So, the descendants with Yinzhi lines

440
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:38,941
will be safe and have a smooth life.

441
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:41,100
That's who you are.

442
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,220
You have this

443
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:44,620
because your ancestors
have accumulated great merits.

444
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:49,100
If the ancestors don't accumulate merits
and do bad things,

445
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,620
what's on the face

446
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,461
of their descendants?

447
00:22:52,821 --> 00:22:53,581
Disabled?

448
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:54,740
Something scarier?

449
00:22:54,941 --> 00:22:55,581
Disfigured?

450
00:22:57,941 --> 00:23:00,020
Nothing. I was just scaring you.

451
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:01,860
But

452
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,061
they will be cursed by all.

453
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,100
Curse and scolded by everyone.

454
00:23:07,461 --> 00:23:10,140
It's much more serious

455
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,821
than disfigured.

456
00:23:11,821 --> 00:23:13,500
Don't scare me, Dr. Sun.

457
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,220
Yinzhi lines and those debt things...

458
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,461
This is a modern society.

459
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,500
We don't believe
in this superstition, do we?

460
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,340
This is not a superstition.

461
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,581
It's a true belief.

462
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:26,860
We now have the clearest genealogy

463
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,541
of the descendants of Confucius.

464
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,740
He cultivated, preached,
and practiced virtues.

465
00:23:31,941 --> 00:23:33,581
This is why until today,

466
00:23:33,581 --> 00:23:35,701
many people still
go to worship him every day.

467
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,301
The Chinese used to name their children

468
00:23:39,301 --> 00:23:41,461
with the characters
of the names of trees.

469
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,860
For example, "song"(pine),
"bai"(cypress) and "nan"(Chinese cedar).

470
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,901
But since having Qin Hui,

471
00:23:46,941 --> 00:23:49,260
people no longer dare
to use the word "hui" (Chinese juniper)

472
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,661
in their children's names.

473
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,181
But you must know this. In the past,

474
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,740
the Chinese juniper

475
00:23:55,941 --> 00:23:58,980
is as precious as the Chinese cedar.

476
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:03,181
So, do you really think that
everything you did

477
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,500
will lightly

478
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,620
be lost in time?

479
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,301
Your scoldings have woken me up.

480
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,260
I have made up my mind.

481
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,260
-You have made up your mind?
-Yes.

482
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,821
-Have you really made up your mind?
-Yes.

483
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:23,500
Good then.

484
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,181
Take this money out now

485
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,980
and return the money to the investors.

486
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,541
When they have peace of mind,
you will have peace of mind.

487
00:24:30,581 --> 00:24:31,941
When they have peace of mind,

488
00:24:32,821 --> 00:24:34,220
you can fall asleep.

489
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:37,821
I can fall asleep.

490
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:39,541
Yes.

491
00:24:40,581 --> 00:24:41,342
Today, I...

492
00:24:41,367 --> 00:24:42,901
Luckily I came to you.

493
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:45,181
What you said has opened up my mind.

494
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,260
I'll go and get it done now.

495
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:48,740
Go now.

496
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:49,740
-I'll go and do it now.
-Hurry up.

497
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:50,340
I'll go and do it now.

498
00:24:57,581 --> 00:24:59,941
You're born kind, you know.

499
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,061
Very kind.

500
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,301
Someone is still lying here.

501
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:03,860
Senior.

502
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,020
Gosh.

503
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,581
I've totally forgotten about you.

504
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,980
How could you forget about
this huge living thing here!

505
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,541
Listen, I forgot about you, really.

506
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:12,541
I forgot about you.

507
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:13,901
You know.

508
00:25:13,941 --> 00:25:16,380
Tou Tou, you said it so well.

509
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:19,260
Today, I've learned something as well.

510
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,500
You've progressed a lot.
You blew me away.

511
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,821
You're great.

512
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:24,661
Really?

513
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,301
Yes.

514
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,581
Is this strength good enough?

515
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,061
Very good.

516
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,581
You're becoming more skillful.

517
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,541
Well, remember to praise me
in front of Ms. Dong then.

518
00:25:34,581 --> 00:25:36,860
Don't worry. I'll handle this.

519
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:37,740
Okay.

520
00:25:52,821 --> 00:25:54,140
You're here for Tuina again?

521
00:25:56,941 --> 00:25:58,500
Why didn't you ask for Ms. Dong?

522
00:25:59,701 --> 00:26:00,941
Well,

523
00:26:01,541 --> 00:26:02,941
just keep Ms. Dong to yourself.

524
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,100
You two are like god versus god.

525
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,220
It's better for me to get Sun Tou Tou.

526
00:26:08,941 --> 00:26:10,980
But she hasn't passed the exam.

527
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,340
Let me tell you.

528
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,340
Tuina

529
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,100
is very profound.

530
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,500
It's about getting along well.

531
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:22,220
Tou Tou gets along well with me.

532
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,980
I tried Tuina from
all the physicians here.

533
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:27,860
I still think Tou Tou is the best.

534
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:31,821
You know, she is very talented.

535
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,821
Shan Dao.

536
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:39,500
I've been thinking about the bloodline.

537
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:44,980
When she first came, Sun Tou Tou

538
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,500
was just a crazy girl.

539
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,340
But look at her now.

540
00:26:50,701 --> 00:26:52,500
She looks like an inheritor now.

541
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,740
She looks so real.

542
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:58,500
When you first brought her here,

543
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,620
I was

544
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,581
just following Master's instructions.

545
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,100
But you

546
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,620
have accepted her, aren't you?

547
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,461
I've been spending my whole life

548
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,701
cultivating discipleship.

549
00:27:17,581 --> 00:27:20,340
After all these years of cultivation,
I realized these two words.

550
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:21,821
Which two words?

551
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,020
"Don't disobey."

552
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:29,740
I did whatever Master told me to do.

553
00:27:30,461 --> 00:27:31,860
You know what? I didn't expect that

554
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:33,860
after all the teachings,

555
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:37,461
I turned a monkey into a practitioner.

556
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,260
A good disciple like the one you have,

557
00:27:44,701 --> 00:27:45,581
there'll be none in the future.

558
00:27:47,461 --> 00:27:48,140
They will be extinct.

559
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,500
Which of the kids nowadays

560
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,661
can do this?

561
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,620
Don't disobey.

562
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:57,661
Let's see if Tou Tou can do it.

563
00:27:58,941 --> 00:28:01,260
If she can do this,

564
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:02,821
that means her apprenticeship
has come to an end.

565
00:28:03,701 --> 00:28:04,941
I can then hand over my job.

566
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:08,620
Your words make a lot of sense.

567
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:11,220
Such a huge cordyceps.

568
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,620
We have kept it for years.

569
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,220
-What is this?
-Lingzhi.

570
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,541
And the deer penis.

571
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:17,740
I saw that before.

572
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,100
Master!

573
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,901
Master!

574
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,781
Senior, please come in.

575
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:24,260
Prof. Ren

576
00:28:24,461 --> 00:28:25,100
Mrs. Zhu.

577
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:27,421
Mrs. Zhu.

578
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:28,941
Hello, Mrs. Zhu.
I'm Mr. Wu, the principal.

579
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,661
-Hello, Mr. Wu.
-Hello.

580
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:32,860
Look.

581
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,740
These are all Zhu's wishes.

582
00:28:36,941 --> 00:28:38,469
He hoarded these treasures

583
00:28:38,494 --> 00:28:40,020
but they're useless now.

584
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,620
So, I brought them for you.

585
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:43,020
Look at this.

586
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:45,020
It's 70-year-old wild ginseng.

587
00:28:45,701 --> 00:28:47,461
The root is still intact.

588
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,100
Those two

589
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:53,581
are the 60-year-old tangerine peel.

590
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:55,620
I heard that
it's more expensive than gold.

591
00:28:57,821 --> 00:28:58,620
And this.

592
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,980
I think he said it is

593
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:03,701
the deer musk
produced at high latitudes.

594
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,901
They were
all kept in a safe all the time.

595
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,140
And this cordyceps.

596
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,421
I brought everything here.

597
00:29:08,701 --> 00:29:09,581
Please keep them.

598
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,661
All of these are expensive.

599
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:24,100
I don't know these things

600
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,620
and I don't know how to use them either.

601
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,461
Zhu said

602
00:29:27,581 --> 00:29:29,340
Prof. Ren can use them

603
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,461
on the one who really needs it.

604
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,581
So, please keep them.

605
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,340
Let's keep them then.

606
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:47,860
Thank you.

607
00:29:51,461 --> 00:29:51,980
Tou Tou.

608
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,980
Carefully record everything

609
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,220
and send it to the medical center.

610
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:57,661
Okay.

611
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,301
Prof. Ren.

612
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:01,740
And this.

613
00:30:03,581 --> 00:30:06,581
The donation from Zhu
to the apprentice class.

614
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:12,340
When he was conscious,
he specifically told me that

615
00:30:12,941 --> 00:30:14,140
Prof. Ren

616
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,701
could even educate a kid like Tou Tou.

617
00:30:16,701 --> 00:30:18,260
The merits of
the apprentice class were immeasurable.

618
00:30:21,581 --> 00:30:22,620
He also said that

619
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:26,421
our family will be entrusted
to the medical center in the future.

620
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:29,461
How can I not donate some?

621
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,980
Well, that...

622
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,140
Zhu was

623
00:30:38,941 --> 00:30:42,821
complimenting or scolding me?

624
00:30:42,821 --> 00:30:44,980
-Why do I feel that...
-He was praising you.

625
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:51,701
Mrs. Zhu.

626
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:55,980
I understand

627
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,220
what Zhu said.

628
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:58,941
Thank you.

629
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,140
Thank you.

630
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,461
Li Quan.

631
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:17,100
You're not working today?

632
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:18,340
Mr. Wu.

633
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,740
Today, I come here to work.

634
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,380
Anything?

635
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,860
I heard Mr. Tu say

636
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,620
you're applying to become a full-time.

637
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,380
But I have one piece of advice.

638
00:31:31,941 --> 00:31:35,100
I hope you won't become
a full-time medical sales agent.

639
00:31:35,701 --> 00:31:38,941
You have to make time for studying.

640
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,500
I believe in you.

641
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:42,860
I hope you too

642
00:31:42,941 --> 00:31:45,620
can become a great doctor in the future.

643
00:31:46,581 --> 00:31:49,980
You know, a swamp won't be able
to restrain a roc bird with its dream.

644
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:53,461
That's right.

645
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:57,260
Mr. Wu, recently, my company

646
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:59,661
has just gotten the approval
for a batch of medicines.

647
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,061
We hope
the tertiary hospitals can use them.

648
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,020
The tender is coming up.

649
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,740
I don't quite understand the process,

650
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,380
so I hope you can have a look.

651
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:12,941
Good.

652
00:32:32,701 --> 00:32:33,980
Tu asked you to come, right?

653
00:32:36,581 --> 00:32:38,260
Do you know what you are doing?

654
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:42,740
A scholar

655
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,581
should not be impulsive

656
00:32:46,461 --> 00:32:48,100
let alone go with the flow.

657
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,500
Let's rest the matter here.

658
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,461
I'll pretend you haven't been here.

659
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:59,860
Mr. Wu, don't worry.

660
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:02,100
This card is in my name.
It has nothing to do with you.

661
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,541
You just need to spend it.

662
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,100
We are only...

663
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:17,461
Kid.

664
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,541
Do you know why I wanted to help you?

665
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,181
That's because you are kind.

666
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:27,701
You help the poor and the weak.

667
00:33:27,701 --> 00:33:30,260
Enough, enough.
I don't want to hear this.

668
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,380
Society is very complicated.

669
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:38,340
One must learn to hold oneself.

670
00:33:39,581 --> 00:33:42,020
You must know what to do
and what not to do.

671
00:33:42,581 --> 00:33:44,140
You must keep it in mind.

672
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,220
But Mr. Wu,

673
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,220
I know you've been good to me.

674
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:54,980
I won't harm you.

675
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,860
We've gone through
the medicine countless times.

676
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:59,340
It absolutely has no quality issue.

677
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,301
Li Quan.

678
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:04,461
I recommended you work there

679
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,461
as a part-time medical sales agent

680
00:34:07,461 --> 00:34:09,860
because I want you
to study medicine well.

681
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:10,980
But

682
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:14,100
when I went for a Tuina recently,

683
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,340
you were not there.

684
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,701
When I went to the medical center,

685
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:17,821
you weren't there either.

686
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,701
I just want to ask you this.

687
00:34:24,941 --> 00:34:27,140
Do you still want to be a doctor?

688
00:34:32,941 --> 00:34:33,500
I want.

689
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:38,541
But I don't have
the identity like Tou Tou

690
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:41,500
nor a background like Tian Zhen.

691
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:45,061
I still have a family
waiting for me to help.

692
00:34:46,461 --> 00:34:47,500
I have a dream,

693
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,701
but I don't have the capital
to realize my dream.

694
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:52,620
I know you'll be very disappointed in me

695
00:34:52,821 --> 00:34:53,941
when I say that.

696
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:55,581
Actually, I am

697
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,220
disappointed in myself too.

698
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:00,821
But Mr. Wu,

699
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:04,461
for the children
from poor families like us

700
00:35:04,821 --> 00:35:06,581
to prove ourselves in society...

701
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:10,061
Don't keep using poverty as an excuse

702
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,821
and justify your laziness.

703
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,020
Many people in this world

704
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:16,260
went through poverty.

705
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:17,941
Take me for example.

706
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:21,581
Back then, my family background
was almost the same as yours.

707
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,740
And Prof. Ren.

708
00:35:22,941 --> 00:35:25,220
His family was extremely poor.

709
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:26,581
But right now...

710
00:35:27,821 --> 00:35:30,860
We may not be some influential people,

711
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:34,541
but you can consider us
as pillars of strength.

712
00:35:37,701 --> 00:35:40,140
You must pursue your goal

713
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,581
and be practical.

714
00:35:42,821 --> 00:35:44,261
You can't be opportunistic.

715
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:49,261
These are all that I want to tell you.

716
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,661
Go back and think about it.

717
00:35:54,461 --> 00:35:54,981
This...

718
00:35:56,261 --> 00:35:57,100
Take it away.

719
00:35:58,941 --> 00:35:59,860
Tell Tu

720
00:36:00,981 --> 00:36:02,261
not to do this with me.

721
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:03,620
Otherwise,

722
00:36:04,981 --> 00:36:06,580
I'll go find President Zheng.

723
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,058
Well,

724
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,686
we can't say that
we shouldn't get married

725
00:36:54,711 --> 00:36:56,040
if we can't afford to buy a house,

726
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:58,100
or don't get a baby
if we don't stay near the school.

727
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,741
I don't know what other people think,

728
00:36:59,741 --> 00:37:02,300
but this is what I think.

729
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:07,340
I think if having a partner

730
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:09,221
is more tiresome than being alone,

731
00:37:09,501 --> 00:37:10,620
I'd rather be single.

732
00:37:11,741 --> 00:37:13,300
Love can't feed you.

733
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:16,060
I'm facing
the hardships of this city now.

734
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:18,540
I don't want my kids to lose

735
00:37:18,941 --> 00:37:19,820
from the moment he is born.

736
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:40,741
You're just a messenger for us.

737
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:42,461
If he is okay,

738
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:43,741
then everyone will be happy.

739
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,340
If he's not okay,

740
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:47,580
you just return the card to me.

741
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:49,820
This has nothing to do with you.

742
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,140
But

743
00:37:53,221 --> 00:37:54,780
if you manage to do this,

744
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:57,300
the sales from the hospitals,

745
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:59,140
I'll give you one point.

746
00:38:01,221 --> 00:38:02,981
As for how much this one point is,

747
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:07,901
I guess you don't need me
to calculate for you, right?

748
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:24,741
Hello, Mom.

749
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,021
We're home.

750
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:39,901
Where is everybody?

751
00:38:40,741 --> 00:38:41,620
I guess they've gone out.

752
00:38:42,981 --> 00:38:44,300
Why did they go out at this hour?

753
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:45,181
Perhaps to take a walk.

754
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:53,620
Let's go.

755
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:54,181
Okay.

756
00:38:57,021 --> 00:38:58,501
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

757
00:38:58,501 --> 00:38:59,300
You've scared me.

758
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,981
♫ To you ♫

759
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:04,780
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

760
00:39:04,941 --> 00:39:08,540
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

761
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:12,021
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

762
00:39:14,261 --> 00:39:16,620
Wait! Whose birthday is it?

763
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:18,820
We sang the song
yet you still don't know?

764
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,780
It's your birthday.

765
00:39:23,021 --> 00:39:23,780
Me?

766
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,820
Mom, Dad, have a seat.

767
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,221
Quan.

768
00:39:43,981 --> 00:39:45,741
Why are you living alone now?

769
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:48,941
I used to share with a girl.

770
00:39:48,981 --> 00:39:50,540
But it was inconvenient,
so, I moved out.

771
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:53,261
Was it the girl you like?

772
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,540
No, Mom.
I don't have a girl that I like.

773
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:57,540
You told me during Chinese New Year.

774
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:58,901
Don't talk about that useless thing.

775
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,021
Talk about the fish pond.

776
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:02,421
Fish pond?

777
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,181
What's wrong with the fish pond?

778
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:05,501
Quan.

779
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,060
It's haunted.

780
00:40:08,221 --> 00:40:09,501
The fish pond at our house

781
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:11,100
have had three cars went into in

782
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:13,261
within two months.

783
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:17,181
We've been doing
fish farming for three to five years,

784
00:40:17,221 --> 00:40:20,140
but we've never encountered
such a wicked thing.

785
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:23,860
Three incidents in a row?

786
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:24,741
That's right.

787
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:27,100
The drivers were rescued,

788
00:40:27,261 --> 00:40:29,300
but the cars have ruined the fish pond.

789
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:32,060
The pond is filled with engine oil,

790
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:34,300
so the oil stains float on the water.

791
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:36,380
All the fishes are dead.

792
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:38,540
When the first car plunged in,

793
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:39,941
it was so scary.

794
00:40:40,221 --> 00:40:41,620
The driver almost died.

795
00:40:41,941 --> 00:40:43,140
Luckily,
your brother was quick to respond.

796
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,580
He jumped into the pond with a wrench

797
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,501
and dragged the driver out

798
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:47,901
by smashing the windscreen.

799
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:49,340
Otherwise,

800
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:50,620
the car and the driver

801
00:40:51,221 --> 00:40:51,701
would...

802
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:54,181
Is my brother okay?

803
00:40:54,221 --> 00:40:55,461
What could have happened to him?

804
00:40:56,221 --> 00:40:58,941
There is no way to farm the fish now.

805
00:40:58,941 --> 00:41:00,941
We need at least a few years

806
00:41:00,941 --> 00:41:03,461
to get rid of all the leftover oil.

807
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:06,300
Otherwise, the fish will have
the smell of the engine oil.

808
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:09,540
This pond is completely ruined.

809
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:13,060
Did they drink and drive?

810
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:14,901
They have to compensate, Dad.

811
00:41:15,221 --> 00:41:16,741
Have you asked
for the village head's help?

812
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:19,941
Yes, but we didn't get it.

813
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:21,780
Why?

814
00:41:21,941 --> 00:41:24,620
The drivers sued us first.

815
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:26,221
They said there were

816
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:28,021
no warning signs at night
at the fish pond.

817
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:29,701
They couldn't see anything.

818
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:36,501
Well,

819
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:39,661
the birth date
on my ID card isn't today.

820
00:41:39,701 --> 00:41:41,060
You got it wrong.

821
00:41:41,221 --> 00:41:44,261
Well, I said it's your birthday,
so it's your birthday.

822
00:41:44,981 --> 00:41:45,820
Master.

823
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:48,261
Do you have a craving for alcohol?

824
00:41:48,501 --> 00:41:50,300
You force her to celebrate a birthday.

825
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,300
You can't say that to your master.

826
00:41:53,461 --> 00:41:54,741
Well, Tou Tou

827
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,941
have been here for some time.

828
00:41:56,941 --> 00:41:58,540
But we've never
celebrated birthday for her.

829
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,860
We've got to give her a birthday.

830
00:42:01,221 --> 00:42:03,300
Humans must have a sense of ritual.

831
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:04,540
They should at least know

832
00:42:04,981 --> 00:42:06,620
who are they and where they come from,

833
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:08,060
and where are they heading to, right?

834
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:09,901
Right now, I don't need to know

835
00:42:10,021 --> 00:42:11,300
where I come from,

836
00:42:11,461 --> 00:42:13,060
because I really don't know

837
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:14,701
when was I born.

838
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:16,780
But right now, I

839
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:20,300
know exactly where I'm heading to.

840
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:21,421
Where are you heading to?

841
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:25,140
I will work hard

842
00:42:28,501 --> 00:42:29,300
and be the inheritor.

843
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,360
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

844
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,720

traditional Chinese medicine books)
