1
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,240
Tou Tou

2
00:00:09,673 --> 00:00:11,192
has been with us for quite some time,

3
00:00:11,362 --> 00:00:13,253
and we have never
celebrated her birthday.

4
00:00:13,337 --> 00:00:15,246
We should at least
celebrate it once.

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,560
We need to have a sense of ceremony.

6
00:00:18,017 --> 00:00:20,976
At the very least, we should know
who we are, where we come from,

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,320
and where we are going, right?

8
00:00:22,457 --> 00:00:24,157
I don't need to know

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,560
where I came from anymore

10
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:27,334
because I really don't know

11
00:00:27,417 --> 00:00:29,274
when I was born.

12
00:00:30,017 --> 00:00:31,017
But I know

13
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,214
very clearly

14
00:00:33,297 --> 00:00:34,337
where I'm going.

15
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:35,920
Where are you going?

16
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,280
I want to work hard to become

17
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,477
the successor.

18
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,920
It's not as easy as you make it sound.

19
00:00:45,547 --> 00:00:47,586
Is it that easy to be a successor?

20
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:50,439
Do you know how many people
are eyeing covetously

21
00:00:50,617 --> 00:00:52,338
this position of successor?

22
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:56,680
Mr Wu is talented
and a great asset to the country.

23
00:00:56,853 --> 00:00:58,253
Isn't he more suitable

24
00:00:58,457 --> 00:01:00,576
for the position of successor than you?

25
00:01:01,027 --> 00:01:03,266
Master, now you're just teasing me.

26
00:01:03,497 --> 00:01:04,774
No matter how hard I try,

27
00:01:04,857 --> 00:01:06,457
my aptitude is just average.

28
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,356
Unlike you, who are
from a prestigious lineage.

29
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:10,640
You see, I've been working hard
for half my life.

30
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:11,839
But when I look up,

31
00:01:12,399 --> 00:01:14,880
I see Tou Tou standing on my shoulders.

32
00:01:15,777 --> 00:01:17,157
Senior Uncle, after hearing
what you said,

33
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,000
I feel like you really are
a bit covetous.

34
00:01:20,386 --> 00:01:22,947
Tou Tou, you said that
your ultimate goal

35
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,719
is to become the successor,

36
00:01:25,199 --> 00:01:26,640
but you need to understand

37
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,399
why you are the chosen one.

38
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,597
It's because of the accumulated merits

39
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,316
from your grandmother

40
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:37,880
and great-grandmother over the years.

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,917
Even though you don't know
the exact day of your birth

42
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,436
or where you came from,

43
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:46,680
it doesn't matter.

44
00:01:47,497 --> 00:01:48,497
With your bloodline

45
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:50,519
with all of us here,

46
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:52,552
when our destinies align,

47
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,739
everything falls into place.

48
00:01:57,177 --> 00:01:58,937
That's right. Let's light the candle.

49
00:02:04,199 --> 00:02:06,252
This is the first time
I'm celebrating my birthday.

50
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,320
I'm a little nervous.

51
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,680
Don't be.

52
00:02:12,559 --> 00:02:15,079
What day is today?
I want to remember it.

53
00:02:15,217 --> 00:02:17,196
You don't need to remember it.
We'll remember it for you.

54
00:02:17,279 --> 00:02:18,076
In the future,

55
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:20,359
you will have a husband and children.

56
00:02:20,559 --> 00:02:21,836
They will gradually make up

57
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:23,040
for your past regrets.

58
00:02:23,787 --> 00:02:25,147
You have a long life ahead of you.

59
00:02:26,494 --> 00:02:27,533
Come on, make a wish.

60
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,760
Hurry.

61
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,120
Done.

62
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,480
So fast.

63
00:02:42,307 --> 00:02:43,307
What did you wish for?

64
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,320
Become the successor.

65
00:02:47,137 --> 00:02:48,157
That's all you wished for?

66
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,317
Aren't you going to wish for

67
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,320
a lifelong partner
who will never leave you?

68
00:02:51,786 --> 00:02:52,905
Life is not

69
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,519
just about being a successor.

70
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,960
I already made that wish.

71
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,877
Okay then.

72
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,960
Blow the candle.

73
00:03:05,673 --> 00:03:06,706
Let's blow it together.

74
00:03:06,999 --> 00:03:08,120
You blow it.

75
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,120
How could they sue us first?

76
00:03:22,897 --> 00:03:24,376
The first car owner claimed that

77
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:26,698
we built the fish pond at a junction

78
00:03:26,786 --> 00:03:28,305
without any road signs.

79
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,918
It poses a safety hazard.

80
00:03:31,097 --> 00:03:33,297
He said the blame is on us.

81
00:03:33,494 --> 00:03:35,087
The third driver said the same thing.

82
00:03:35,611 --> 00:03:38,760
He said we shouldn't have dug
the fish pond at that junction

83
00:03:38,937 --> 00:03:40,214
without any protective barriers.

84
00:03:40,297 --> 00:03:41,417
It's not visible at night,

85
00:03:41,633 --> 00:03:43,752
and he fell into it by accident.

86
00:03:44,153 --> 00:03:46,813
He argued that it was unreasonable
to build the fish pond there.

87
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,600
What about the second driver?

88
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,600
He drove into it in broad daylight.

89
00:03:51,697 --> 00:03:52,824
Are we to blame for that too?

90
00:03:52,907 --> 00:03:54,506
The second driver is even worse.

91
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,120
His insurance company

92
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,320
is accusing me

93
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,020
of colluding with him to defraud them.

94
00:04:01,334 --> 00:04:02,334
It's infuriating!

95
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,076
They are just bullying us.

96
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,517
This is nonsense.

97
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,600
Yes, they are.

98
00:04:07,217 --> 00:04:10,018
We would only earn meagre revenue
in the next few years.

99
00:04:10,113 --> 00:04:12,416
Why would we risk it
to defraud the insurance company?

100
00:04:15,654 --> 00:04:16,654
What did the court say?

101
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:18,759
The judge said

102
00:04:19,679 --> 00:04:20,679
that

103
00:04:21,167 --> 00:04:23,527
the responsibility for this accident
needs to be assessed.

104
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:25,093
Now things have become complicated.

105
00:04:25,177 --> 00:04:26,316
Those in charge of fisheries,

106
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,719
environmental protection,
they all got involved.

107
00:04:27,947 --> 00:04:29,467
They told us a lot of things.

108
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,880
We didn't understand at all.

109
00:04:31,457 --> 00:04:33,377
We asked your brother to explain it,

110
00:04:33,537 --> 00:04:34,689
but even he couldn't understand it.

111
00:04:34,772 --> 00:04:37,291
We've done a lot of things

112
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,600
and spent a lot of money,

113
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,733
but they keep telling us to wait.

114
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,920
Right.

115
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,117
They can wait,
but how can we afford to wait?

116
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,200
Mum.

117
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,397
What can we rely on
to make a living this year?

118
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,840
-Don't be like this.
-Also,

119
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:53,463
your brother will be
entering high school next year.

120
00:04:53,772 --> 00:04:54,932
Don't cry, Mum.

121
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,953
Dad, what did the village chief say?

122
00:04:58,786 --> 00:04:59,985
The village chief blamed us.

123
00:05:00,777 --> 00:05:02,296
He said this village has feng shui.

124
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,557
We disrupted the water.

125
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,760
The village will face problems
in the future.

126
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,480
He's talking nonsense!

127
00:05:09,257 --> 00:05:11,527
They have been enjoying the ducks
we gave him for free for so many years.

128
00:05:11,617 --> 00:05:13,017
How can he be so ungrateful?

129
00:05:13,587 --> 00:05:15,106
When trouble comes, he chickens out.

130
00:05:17,777 --> 00:05:19,374
This is your fault.

131
00:05:19,457 --> 00:05:23,437
If you had married his niece,
he would have helped us.

132
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,717
Enough! Don't even bring that up!

133
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,046
How can you blame that on me?

134
00:05:34,497 --> 00:05:35,497
This is what I will do.

135
00:05:36,017 --> 00:05:38,040
I have a friend who studies law.
She's pretty good.

136
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,040
I will consult her.

137
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,760
You guys will spend the night here.

138
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,600
We will talk tomorrow, okay?

139
00:05:47,977 --> 00:05:50,005
The place is a little small.
I'll sleep on the floor.

140
00:05:50,126 --> 00:05:51,126
It's convenient.

141
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,480
Grandpa.

142
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,439
Thank you for

143
00:06:26,627 --> 00:06:28,907
throwing me a birthday party.

144
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,040
I'm really flattered.

145
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,999
It's such a big piece of cake, right?

146
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,959
Sun Tou Tou,

147
00:06:38,617 --> 00:06:41,056
I've arranged for
such a big event for you.

148
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,000
Is this how you repay me?

149
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:46,959
You are so unkind.

150
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,080
I mean, Grandpa,

151
00:06:50,337 --> 00:06:52,497
it's because of your health.

152
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,120
You can't have too many cakes.

153
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,720
If you could, I would have

154
00:06:57,097 --> 00:06:58,257
let you eat it.

155
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:21,439
Happy now?

156
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,999
I'm being kind to you now, right?

157
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,596
That's more like it.

158
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:28,800
Eat it now. Don't let Grandma see it.

159
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,493
If she catches you,
she's going to scold me too.

160
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,320
Hide it from here.

161
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,200
I'm good to you, huh?

162
00:07:40,537 --> 00:07:41,537
Is it good?

163
00:07:41,857 --> 00:07:43,257
I'm good to you, right, Grandpa?

164
00:07:46,497 --> 00:07:47,497
Stop.

165
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:53,159
Grandpa.

166
00:07:54,239 --> 00:07:55,239
Grandpa, here.

167
00:07:59,817 --> 00:08:00,817
Yes, yes.

168
00:08:02,457 --> 00:08:03,777
You are the best.

169
00:08:04,119 --> 00:08:04,957
Of course, Grandpa.

170
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,639
Our cooperation today was seamless.

171
00:08:07,897 --> 00:08:08,897
It was excellent.

172
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:16,159
That's enough. Don't eat too much.

173
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:17,076
No more.

174
00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:18,159
No more.

175
00:08:18,679 --> 00:08:20,600
Keep your voice down.

176
00:08:29,192 --> 00:08:30,192
Honey,

177
00:08:31,097 --> 00:08:32,458
you're very likely

178
00:08:33,086 --> 00:08:35,007
about to have a daughter-in-law.

179
00:08:38,532 --> 00:08:39,436
Wait.

180
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,519
What?

181
00:08:41,119 --> 00:08:43,439
But Meng Meng just died.

182
00:08:44,373 --> 00:08:46,493
Didn't you notice it?

183
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:50,699
Tian Zhen and Tou Tou
are seeing each other.

184
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,220
It's...

185
00:08:53,979 --> 00:08:54,979
It's impossible.

186
00:08:55,967 --> 00:08:57,046
Not long ago,

187
00:08:58,217 --> 00:09:00,856
Tian Zhen told me that
he has feelings for someone,

188
00:09:00,946 --> 00:09:02,186
but he hasn't confessed yet.

189
00:09:03,294 --> 00:09:04,934
This someone he said,

190
00:09:05,067 --> 00:09:06,546
why can't it be Tou Tou?

191
00:09:06,977 --> 00:09:08,097
That's impossible.

192
00:09:08,986 --> 00:09:11,745
Tou Tou isn't like a girl at all.

193
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,139
Different people
have different preferences.

194
00:09:14,337 --> 00:09:16,460
Besides, it's not like
you're the one marrying her.

195
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:22,393
How could you tell?

196
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,719
Their eyes.

197
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:25,897
Didn't you see the way

198
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,640
Tian Zhen looked at Tou Tou
when he said...

199
00:09:28,773 --> 00:09:30,959
A lifelong partner
who will never leave you.

200
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,320
Life is not

201
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,979
just about being a successor.

202
00:09:36,719 --> 00:09:38,159
The way he was looking at her.

203
00:09:41,334 --> 00:09:42,533
The weird thing is,

204
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:46,120
normally, when Tou Tou heard such words,

205
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,439
she would have already exclaimed

206
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:50,240
that she won't get married.

207
00:09:51,047 --> 00:09:52,247
But today,

208
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,199
she didn't say anything.

209
00:09:58,293 --> 00:09:59,919
You women always

210
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:01,799
overthink things.

211
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,280
Just keep my words in mind.

212
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,439
What do you think?

213
00:10:10,066 --> 00:10:11,066
If Tou Tou

214
00:10:11,817 --> 00:10:13,697
gets together with Tian Zhen,

215
00:10:13,857 --> 00:10:14,898
do you think

216
00:10:15,272 --> 00:10:17,113
she's not good enough for Tian Zhen?

217
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:23,885
They're a perfect match.

218
00:10:24,599 --> 00:10:26,599
Tian Zhen needs someone like Tou Tou.

219
00:10:26,777 --> 00:10:29,697
Tou Tou is a decisive girl.

220
00:10:30,066 --> 00:10:31,386
Tian Zhen grew up in

221
00:10:31,617 --> 00:10:33,658
a protective environment.

222
00:10:34,179 --> 00:10:35,260
Ling Lan, as his mother,

223
00:10:35,367 --> 00:10:36,887
has a strong personality.

224
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,200
Tian Zhen has always lacked
assertiveness since childhood.

225
00:10:40,993 --> 00:10:42,914
If he's with Tou Tou,

226
00:10:43,127 --> 00:10:45,518
they will complement
each other perfectly.

227
00:10:45,726 --> 00:10:46,726
Moreover,

228
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,960
Tou Tou entered society earlier

229
00:10:49,239 --> 00:10:50,919
and has more experience.

230
00:10:51,179 --> 00:10:53,934
She has a broader perspective
when dealing with things.

231
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:56,233
If they really become a couple,

232
00:10:56,817 --> 00:10:59,016
it will be a blessing for our family.

233
00:11:00,599 --> 00:11:02,437
You're one of a kind.

234
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,960
You think other people are
better than your own grandson.

235
00:11:05,617 --> 00:11:06,617
In my eyes,

236
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:08,317
my grandson is perfect in every way.

237
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,956
Tou Tou, as the successor,

238
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:11,720
is barely a good match to my grandson.

239
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:14,919
Listen,

240
00:11:15,652 --> 00:11:16,933
pretend you don't know.

241
00:11:17,439 --> 00:11:18,439
Got it?

242
00:11:19,239 --> 00:11:20,239
Why?

243
00:11:22,186 --> 00:11:24,986
Don't you want a great-grandson sooner?

244
00:11:25,297 --> 00:11:26,297
Got it?

245
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,197
Got it.

246
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,840
No matter who asks,

247
00:11:30,427 --> 00:11:31,667
I will say I don't know.

248
00:11:32,257 --> 00:11:33,257
There you go.

249
00:11:40,817 --> 00:11:45,240
(As the Cold Dew season begins,
cold air moves southward.)

250
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:48,497
(There is a significant temperature
difference between day and night.)

251
00:11:49,349 --> 00:11:51,097
(Autumn dryness becomes evident.)

252
00:11:52,057 --> 00:11:53,831
(There is more dew.
The days carry a sense of chill.)

253
00:11:55,092 --> 00:11:59,137
(Hence the name "Cold Dew".)

254
00:12:02,747 --> 00:12:06,856
(Cold Dew)

255
00:12:19,353 --> 00:12:20,512
Morning, Grandpa.

256
00:12:23,246 --> 00:12:24,527
Any news today?

257
00:12:25,738 --> 00:12:26,738
Yes.

258
00:12:29,933 --> 00:12:30,933
Hang on.

259
00:12:31,719 --> 00:12:33,479
What did you see that amused you?

260
00:12:33,773 --> 00:12:34,973
You.

261
00:12:36,457 --> 00:12:38,058
What's so amusing about me?

262
00:12:38,565 --> 00:12:39,565
You...

263
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,880
I can't tell you I know.

264
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,160
Hang on.

265
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,599
Tell me what you know.

266
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,039
I... I don't know anything.

267
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,280
I envy you.

268
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,200
It's so nice to be young.

269
00:13:01,577 --> 00:13:03,577
What did you see that made you so happy?

270
00:13:04,599 --> 00:13:06,317
I don't know. Stop asking.

271
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,959
I... I don't know.

272
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:08,974
Fine, fine.

273
00:13:09,057 --> 00:13:10,218
You keep that up.

274
00:13:10,937 --> 00:13:13,177
Mum, can you help me take a
day off from the medical centre?

275
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:15,736
I'm going to the apprentice class today.
Li Quan wants to see me.

276
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,860
Is Tou Tou awake yet?

277
00:13:19,297 --> 00:13:20,740
She's in the study with your dad.

278
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,700
She's having a lesson
so early in the morning?

279
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,613
I will skip breakfast.
I have to go now.

280
00:13:32,297 --> 00:13:33,297
Grandpa,

281
00:13:33,752 --> 00:13:35,192
you keep having fun here.

282
00:13:53,337 --> 00:13:54,370
Thank you, Dr Sun.

283
00:13:54,453 --> 00:13:55,877
Your words today have enlightened me

284
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,960
and made me contemplate for a long time.

285
00:13:57,173 --> 00:13:59,840
But you asked me to transfer
the money back and give it up

286
00:14:00,217 --> 00:14:01,670
just to have a clear conscience.

287
00:14:02,754 --> 00:14:03,754
I can't do it.

288
00:14:05,554 --> 00:14:06,794
You are losing sleep

289
00:14:07,417 --> 00:14:08,857
just because of this?

290
00:14:14,217 --> 00:14:15,534
Everyone has their own destiny.

291
00:14:15,617 --> 00:14:17,639
He has already made his choice.
Let him be.

292
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:24,680
I just feel bad.

293
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,560
Why are you feeling bad?

294
00:14:27,398 --> 00:14:29,278
Did I say something wrong?

295
00:14:29,445 --> 00:14:30,410
No, you didn't.

296
00:14:30,493 --> 00:14:32,199
Yes, but the same reasoning,

297
00:14:32,457 --> 00:14:35,017
when you told it to Cheng Ying, Zhu Xia,

298
00:14:35,253 --> 00:14:36,532
and Madam Jiang,

299
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,633
they all accepted it
and changed themselves.

300
00:14:39,186 --> 00:14:40,347
I told Daring Lu

301
00:14:40,653 --> 00:14:42,172
the same reasoning,

302
00:14:44,853 --> 00:14:46,086
yet he just won't listen.

303
00:14:47,599 --> 00:14:48,599
What does this tell us?

304
00:14:50,033 --> 00:14:52,059
It tells us that the reasoning
works with you

305
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,520
but not with me.

306
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,000
Zhu Chang Ming

307
00:14:58,834 --> 00:14:59,834
didn't listen to me too.

308
00:15:02,592 --> 00:15:04,592
Everyone speaks of reason in the world.

309
00:15:04,925 --> 00:15:06,526
If everyone is reasonable,

310
00:15:07,332 --> 00:15:08,730
then there will only be Yang

311
00:15:08,813 --> 00:15:09,813
and no Yin.

312
00:15:10,286 --> 00:15:11,866
There will be no human world anymore.

313
00:15:19,057 --> 00:15:22,536
I still believe that your power
for goodness is greater than mine.

314
00:15:23,573 --> 00:15:24,573
That's why

315
00:15:25,457 --> 00:15:26,618
I can't convince him.

316
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,739
You are still so young.

317
00:15:30,439 --> 00:15:32,439
Just think about how old I am.

318
00:15:33,217 --> 00:15:35,977
You didn't see the times
when I suffered losses

319
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,680
and backed down.

320
00:15:39,012 --> 00:15:40,012
Really.

321
00:15:40,817 --> 00:15:43,176
I have been through
countless trials and hardships,

322
00:15:44,398 --> 00:15:47,718
and have just started
to see a glimmer of success.

323
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:48,879
If at your age,

324
00:15:50,119 --> 00:15:52,520
you could succeed in everything you do,
create miracles,

325
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,637
then I wouldn't have been your master,

326
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,320
you would have been mine.

327
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,119
So, Tou Tou,

328
00:16:01,893 --> 00:16:03,560
you must always

329
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,079
do the right thing.

330
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,693
Don't be too attached to material gains,
don't pity yourself.

331
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:09,960
And you will become what I am today.

332
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
But Master,

333
00:16:15,233 --> 00:16:17,793
Daring Lu just got away like this

334
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:19,364
and escaped justice.

335
00:16:20,681 --> 00:16:24,121
There was another person
similar to Daring Lu.

336
00:16:24,345 --> 00:16:25,583
You can find information
about him online.

337
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,119
His name is Lai Chang Xing.

338
00:16:27,897 --> 00:16:29,830
He was on the run overseas
for many years,

339
00:16:30,913 --> 00:16:32,480
but eventually, he was apprehended.

340
00:16:33,345 --> 00:16:34,986
So, you should have faith in justice

341
00:16:35,857 --> 00:16:37,217
and in God.

342
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:41,960
If that's the case,

343
00:16:42,572 --> 00:16:45,853
there will be no bad people
who can escape the law in this world.

344
00:16:49,537 --> 00:16:51,817
In China, freedom...

345
00:16:51,911 --> 00:16:52,911
What is freedom?

346
00:16:54,497 --> 00:16:57,418
Freedom is not
the ultimate state of carefreeness,

347
00:16:57,719 --> 00:16:58,919
it is being at ease.

348
00:17:00,539 --> 00:17:01,825
What does it mean to be at ease?

349
00:17:02,817 --> 00:17:05,018
Confucius has explained it very clearly.

350
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,999
Do as you desire, but stay within
the bounds of propriety.

351
00:17:09,377 --> 00:17:11,497
Propriety is the object.

352
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:16,199
Imagine someone
hiding overseas for 20 years.

353
00:17:17,377 --> 00:17:18,817
Will they be at ease in their heart?

354
00:17:19,287 --> 00:17:20,407
Impossible.

355
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,520
20 years.

356
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,359
20 years of hiding,
sleeping with one eye open.

357
00:17:25,592 --> 00:17:27,938
It would be better to be
imprisoned or sentenced to death.

358
00:17:30,719 --> 00:17:32,160
Now, let's imagine there's a person

359
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,597
who has a family, children,

360
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,317
and a very successful career
that keeps growing.

361
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,677
The higher he climbs,

362
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,719
the more fearful he becomes.

363
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,479
How can he truly be at ease?

364
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:50,520
Daring Lu

365
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,680
is used to living a lavish lifestyle.

366
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,719
He won't be able
to stay in a small place

367
00:17:59,959 --> 00:18:00,999
like Palau for long.

368
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,560
Then, he will turn himself in.

369
00:18:08,086 --> 00:18:09,086
Right?

370
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,047
Right.

371
00:18:20,817 --> 00:18:22,324
So, that's basically what happened.

372
00:18:22,407 --> 00:18:24,126
Rebecca, is there anything you can do?

373
00:18:25,866 --> 00:18:26,866
Nothing.

374
00:18:27,937 --> 00:18:30,050
Looks like you're not
as capable as the rumours suggest.

375
00:18:30,133 --> 00:18:31,640
They say you win every lawsuit.

376
00:18:31,937 --> 00:18:33,934
Why is it that every time we came to you
with a problem, you have no solution?

377
00:18:34,017 --> 00:18:35,197
I win every lawsuit

378
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,599
because I only take cases
that I can win.

379
00:18:37,973 --> 00:18:39,200
And I can't win this case.

380
00:18:39,417 --> 00:18:42,599
Moreover, Li Quan's family
needs to win this case immediately.

381
00:18:42,977 --> 00:18:44,816
Even God can't help you
to win it right away.

382
00:18:44,937 --> 00:18:46,214
If the lawsuit drags on
for eight or ten years,

383
00:18:46,297 --> 00:18:47,568
they won't be able to use the fish pond.

384
00:18:47,651 --> 00:18:49,091
Yet they still have to pay the rent.

385
00:18:49,226 --> 00:18:50,306
They will be doomed.

386
00:18:50,393 --> 00:18:51,393
That's why I suspect...

387
00:18:51,937 --> 00:18:53,137
-Suspect what?
-Suspect what?

388
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,396
I suspect someone wants

389
00:18:56,479 --> 00:18:57,640
your family's fish pond.

390
00:19:00,257 --> 00:19:02,497
Strange things don't happen
without reason.

391
00:19:02,667 --> 00:19:04,986
Your family has been leasing
the fish pond for 20 years.

392
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,317
Nothing happened over the past years,

393
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,396
but suddenly, within two months,

394
00:19:09,479 --> 00:19:10,760
three cars fell into it.

395
00:19:11,454 --> 00:19:12,734
Is that just a coincidence?

396
00:19:13,707 --> 00:19:15,627
So, you have two options now.

397
00:19:16,057 --> 00:19:16,984
First option,

398
00:19:17,067 --> 00:19:19,080
you can hire a better lawyer
to investigate

399
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,837
and uncover the connection
behind these three drivers,

400
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,920
and prove that

401
00:19:23,057 --> 00:19:24,977
they targeted your family's fish pond.

402
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,319
But this will cost a lot of money,

403
00:19:27,537 --> 00:19:29,437
and you won't be able
to recover that expense.

404
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,906
You will be paying a lot
just to prove that you are right.

405
00:19:33,126 --> 00:19:36,039
Of course, there's another possibility.
I might misjudge it.

406
00:19:36,257 --> 00:19:37,557
It might just be a coincidence.

407
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,760
In that case, your money
would be completely wasted.

408
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,079
Tell me the second option.

409
00:19:43,937 --> 00:19:45,054
Admit defeat.

410
00:19:45,137 --> 00:19:46,294
Return the fish pond to the village.

411
00:19:46,377 --> 00:19:48,251
Tell the village chief that
you're returning the fish pond.

412
00:19:48,337 --> 00:19:49,734
That you don't want
this business anymore.

413
00:19:49,817 --> 00:19:50,894
The village chief

414
00:19:50,977 --> 00:19:53,054
will probably help you
resolve the situation quickly.

415
00:19:53,137 --> 00:19:55,414
But both options would result in
our family losing money.

416
00:19:55,497 --> 00:19:57,677
Well, it's because your family
has been targeted by thieves.

417
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:00,159
No one wanted that piece
of swampy land in the beginning.

418
00:20:00,297 --> 00:20:01,814
Li Quan's father got sick
from digging the land.

419
00:20:01,897 --> 00:20:03,014
It was just cleaned up
not even two years ago.

420
00:20:03,097 --> 00:20:04,336
Why should they give it away?

421
00:20:04,419 --> 00:20:05,419
Why?

422
00:20:05,719 --> 00:20:08,036
Because they are sure that
your family has no money.

423
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:09,880
And that you can only give it up.

424
00:20:16,737 --> 00:20:17,737
What if I have money?

425
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,520
I mean, what if.

426
00:20:21,897 --> 00:20:23,577
If I can prove that

427
00:20:23,747 --> 00:20:25,440
someone is behind this incident,

428
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:27,465
can we get them to compensate?

429
00:20:28,137 --> 00:20:29,137
No.

430
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:30,480
-Why?
-Why?

431
00:20:32,305 --> 00:20:34,065
Because for them,

432
00:20:34,457 --> 00:20:35,857
their biggest loss

433
00:20:35,966 --> 00:20:38,927
is not being able to claim
the insurance money for their cars.

434
00:20:39,399 --> 00:20:41,116
So, it's impossible for you

435
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:41,996
to get them

436
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:43,756
to compensate your family.

437
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:46,159
So basically, all the financial
and material resources

438
00:20:46,318 --> 00:20:47,519
you've spent will be in vain.

439
00:20:50,017 --> 00:20:51,177
This is so unfair.

440
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:54,520
Where in this world
can you find absolute fairness?

441
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,700
Quan, what do you think?

442
00:20:58,479 --> 00:20:59,839
Tell me. What do you think?

443
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,560
Rebecca,

444
00:21:03,393 --> 00:21:05,114
can you recommend me
a really good lawyer?

445
00:21:05,959 --> 00:21:08,005
Are you sure you want
to pursue this to the end?

446
00:21:08,239 --> 00:21:11,119
Are your parents not going
to live in the village anymore?

447
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:13,599
We are poor people.

448
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:15,280
We still have our lives.

449
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:17,756
All right.

450
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:19,396
Quan, I have around about 30,000 yuan.

451
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:20,785
I'll transfer it to you later.

452
00:21:20,959 --> 00:21:22,880
That's barely enough.

453
00:22:02,739 --> 00:22:03,940
Are you waiting for someone?

454
00:22:07,133 --> 00:22:08,934
Rebecca told me about your case.

455
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,500
What do you want to do?

456
00:22:14,297 --> 00:22:15,297
What do you mean?

457
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:19,800
Do you want to investigate
those few insurance fraudsters only?

458
00:22:20,017 --> 00:22:21,654
Let things settle down
and each go their own way?

459
00:22:21,737 --> 00:22:23,837
Or do you want to uncover
the entire chain of interests

460
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,220
behind your village chief
to eliminate future troubles?

461
00:22:30,537 --> 00:22:31,537
Sir,

462
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:33,800
please give me a clear guidance.

463
00:22:39,417 --> 00:22:42,577
This matter involves various interests.

464
00:22:43,427 --> 00:22:46,200
The simplest solution will require
at least this amount of payment.

465
00:22:47,577 --> 00:22:48,577
30,000 yuan?

466
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,760
300,000 yuan.

467
00:22:58,257 --> 00:22:59,737
Sir, can you lower the price?

468
00:23:01,487 --> 00:23:03,127
300,000 yuan is too expensive for me.

469
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,580
Expensive?

470
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,880
Yes.

471
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,440
We are

472
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,719
a team.

473
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,600
Quality comes with a price.

474
00:24:02,457 --> 00:24:04,336
Zhao, you're finally back.

475
00:24:04,492 --> 00:24:06,492
The manager was just looking for you.
Go now.

476
00:24:08,067 --> 00:24:10,276
Be smart. Mr Tu was pulling a long face.

477
00:24:10,359 --> 00:24:11,520
He seemed upset.

478
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,920
Thanks.

479
00:24:19,253 --> 00:24:20,253
Where have you been?

480
00:24:20,706 --> 00:24:21,706
I went to the hospital.

481
00:24:21,959 --> 00:24:23,199
You're lying.

482
00:24:24,297 --> 00:24:25,897
Mr Li just called me.

483
00:24:26,172 --> 00:24:27,172
I asked him about you.

484
00:24:27,613 --> 00:24:28,973
He said he didn't see you at all.

485
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,760
Yes.

486
00:24:31,959 --> 00:24:33,319
I was going to go to see him,

487
00:24:33,479 --> 00:24:34,639
but something came up.

488
00:24:34,737 --> 00:24:36,030
I got distracted and forgot about it.

489
00:24:36,113 --> 00:24:38,306
I came back to get a document.
I will leave right away.

490
00:24:39,719 --> 00:24:40,719
Let me ask you,

491
00:24:40,959 --> 00:24:42,560
how did it go with the task

492
00:24:42,952 --> 00:24:44,045
I entrusted you last time?

493
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:47,839
Zhao Li Quan,

494
00:24:48,126 --> 00:24:49,526
do you still want your job here?

495
00:24:50,097 --> 00:24:52,403
I have no idea what you're busy with
every day at work.

496
00:24:53,257 --> 00:24:55,523
You are late for work,
and you don't socialise with clients.

497
00:24:55,606 --> 00:24:57,405
Are you rich

498
00:24:57,927 --> 00:24:59,207
or is your family rich?

499
00:25:01,177 --> 00:25:03,616
Haven't you always boasted about
your good relationship with Mr Wu?

500
00:25:03,699 --> 00:25:05,179
It's just a card.

501
00:25:05,959 --> 00:25:07,572
Is it that difficult to give it to him?

502
00:25:08,338 --> 00:25:09,338
I gave him the card.

503
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:11,719
You did?

504
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:14,560
Why didn't you say so earlier?

505
00:25:16,623 --> 00:25:17,623
What did Mr Wu say?

506
00:25:18,603 --> 00:25:19,723
He said

507
00:25:20,372 --> 00:25:21,972
he needs some time
to take care of it.

508
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,799
He just called me and told me
to go see him.

509
00:25:25,959 --> 00:25:28,599
This is why I was distracted and
forgot to go to the hospital.

510
00:25:29,239 --> 00:25:30,239
I see.

511
00:25:30,697 --> 00:25:31,876
There is no need
to go to the hospital now.

512
00:25:31,959 --> 00:25:32,999
I'll give Mr Li a call.

513
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:34,319
Go and see Mr Wu now.

514
00:25:34,826 --> 00:25:37,259
Try to secure the early-year
insurance contract this time.

515
00:25:37,906 --> 00:25:38,906
I can't see him today.

516
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,037
Mr Wu and I

517
00:25:41,111 --> 00:25:42,792
agreed to meet up tomorrow morning.

518
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,823
Okay.

519
00:25:44,906 --> 00:25:45,906
Tomorrow morning then.

520
00:25:46,719 --> 00:25:47,614
Don't let me down.

521
00:25:47,697 --> 00:25:48,736
I'm counting on you.

522
00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:51,996
I should get going.

523
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:53,199
Okay, go on.

524
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,520
Unbelievable.

525
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,959
Stop circling around.
You're making me dizzy.

526
00:26:15,976 --> 00:26:16,854
Just be patient.

527
00:26:16,937 --> 00:26:18,457
Our son will be back soon.

528
00:26:19,017 --> 00:26:21,603
He's been gone for such a long time.
Why hasn't he returned yet?

529
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,040
Well, he's busy, isn't he?

530
00:26:28,857 --> 00:26:30,134
-You're home.
-Dad.

531
00:26:30,217 --> 00:26:32,137
-Quan, you're home.
-Mum.

532
00:26:32,847 --> 00:26:34,680
I've reheated the food twice.

533
00:26:34,977 --> 00:26:36,617
It's all your favourite food.

534
00:26:38,433 --> 00:26:39,553
Go get changed for dinner.

535
00:26:51,999 --> 00:26:52,999
Come.

536
00:26:56,097 --> 00:26:57,097
Come now.

537
00:26:58,257 --> 00:26:59,818
Mum, thank you for preparing dinner.

538
00:27:01,137 --> 00:27:03,797
Dad, I consulted my friend today.

539
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,999
She suggested that
we settle outside the court.

540
00:27:06,257 --> 00:27:07,057
Don't worry,

541
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,579
she said she would find me
a good lawyer.

542
00:27:11,179 --> 00:27:12,179
That's great.

543
00:27:13,017 --> 00:27:14,217
Does that mean

544
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:16,398
we will receive compensation soon?

545
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,466
How does the settlement work?

546
00:27:20,097 --> 00:27:21,446
Will we be the ones paying them

547
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,279
or will they pay us?

548
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:26,143
It's good, Mum.

549
00:27:27,097 --> 00:27:28,097
Have some more.

550
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,250
Let's finish dinner first.

551
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,840
Stop eating first, son.

552
00:27:31,713 --> 00:27:33,873
We can't be the one paying them.

553
00:27:35,353 --> 00:27:37,374
Also, we won't be able
to raise fish in our fish pond

554
00:27:37,457 --> 00:27:38,574
for the next three years.

555
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,040
Who will compensate for our loss?

556
00:27:40,897 --> 00:27:42,017
Let's not talk about it now.

557
00:27:42,257 --> 00:27:44,440
Our son has had a long day.
Let's finish dinner first.

558
00:27:44,657 --> 00:27:45,657
Forget about dinner.

559
00:27:45,753 --> 00:27:47,633
How can I eat
without understanding everything?

560
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,400
Here. Have some fish.

561
00:28:13,967 --> 00:28:14,967
You're home.

562
00:28:16,977 --> 00:28:17,977
How did it go?

563
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,060
Are you upset?

564
00:28:22,615 --> 00:28:23,934
You didn't see Little Lark?

565
00:28:24,017 --> 00:28:25,017
No.

566
00:28:25,719 --> 00:28:27,080
-She didn't go?
-She did.

567
00:28:27,297 --> 00:28:28,737
Then, how come you didn't see her?

568
00:28:28,853 --> 00:28:29,892
I saw her.

569
00:28:30,217 --> 00:28:32,717
You said you didn't see her, and then
the next second you said you did.

570
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,279
Did you see her or not?

571
00:28:35,577 --> 00:28:37,176
Are you trying to pick a fight?

572
00:28:38,687 --> 00:28:40,807
Why would I want to pick a fight?

573
00:28:41,617 --> 00:28:44,370
Don't I greet you like this every day
when you come back from outside?

574
00:28:44,453 --> 00:28:46,172
Why is it suddenly not allowed today?

575
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,437
You asked me if I saw Little Lark.

576
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,239
I said no, and you...

577
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,437
That means I saw her.

578
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,680
It's the same as the answer
I gave before.

579
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,396
I didn't change it.

580
00:28:56,479 --> 00:28:58,119
-You are...
-Hang on, hang on.

581
00:28:58,297 --> 00:28:59,697
Don't confuse me.

582
00:29:00,954 --> 00:29:01,954
I asked you

583
00:29:02,567 --> 00:29:04,087
if you saw Little Lark.

584
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:05,437
Weren't you supposed to say

585
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,599
you saw her?

586
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:09,160
Why did you say you didn't see her?

587
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:12,177
Who is actually in the wrong?

588
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,520
And you came home
with a frown on your face.

589
00:29:14,933 --> 00:29:16,159
What is the meaning of this?

590
00:29:16,959 --> 00:29:17,959
Let's drop it.

591
00:29:18,199 --> 00:29:19,760
Can we not discuss this anymore?

592
00:29:24,017 --> 00:29:26,496
As soon as I asked,
you just want to shut me up.

593
00:29:27,912 --> 00:29:29,032
Did I offend you?

594
00:29:30,006 --> 00:29:31,286
Did I make you angry?

595
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:35,319
Is it because someone else

596
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,839
ignored you?

597
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,078
That's why they say

598
00:29:52,161 --> 00:29:55,561
time is like a butcher's knife.

599
00:29:56,839 --> 00:29:59,680
The dashing young men

600
00:30:01,692 --> 00:30:04,093
all look the same
when they reach their middle age.

601
00:30:04,257 --> 00:30:06,613
Didn't the boys in your class
cry their hearts out?

602
00:30:06,708 --> 00:30:08,866
Who do you think you are,

603
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:10,350
giving me attitude?

604
00:30:11,132 --> 00:30:12,462
If you have the guts,

605
00:30:12,678 --> 00:30:14,318
show that attitude to Little Lark.

606
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:18,839
Why?

607
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:21,012
Do you think
everyone is crazy about you?

608
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,560
You are the only one
who is crazy about him.

609
00:30:29,239 --> 00:30:30,239
Young Master,

610
00:30:30,807 --> 00:30:33,607
want me to arrange a blind date
for you tomorrow?

611
00:30:37,697 --> 00:30:38,738
Too easy.

612
00:30:53,959 --> 00:30:55,199
What are they fighting about?

613
00:30:57,079 --> 00:30:58,199
Xin Zheng

614
00:30:59,119 --> 00:31:00,880
went to see his ex-girlfriend.

615
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,719
At this age,

616
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:08,916
how could she still be jealous?

617
00:31:08,999 --> 00:31:10,999
Xin Zheng isn't that kind of man.

618
00:31:11,697 --> 00:31:13,457
If he had wanted to fool around,

619
00:31:13,766 --> 00:31:14,805
when he was young,

620
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,876
so many patients

621
00:31:16,959 --> 00:31:18,959
were infatuated with him.

622
00:31:20,377 --> 00:31:23,278
That also depends on whether
Xin Zheng is infatuated with anyone.

623
00:31:24,338 --> 00:31:25,338
You women

624
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:27,839
always have imaginary enemies.

625
00:31:28,937 --> 00:31:30,777
My enemy wasn't imaginary back then.

626
00:31:33,199 --> 00:31:34,317
Don't bring up the past.

627
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,957
Life is only so long,

628
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,319
What matters is
who the ultimate winner is in the end.

629
00:31:38,857 --> 00:31:40,857
I'm all yours now,

630
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:42,199
aren't I?

631
00:31:43,439 --> 00:31:44,439
Cheesy.

632
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:47,177
But then again,

633
00:31:47,332 --> 00:31:50,372
it's me who has been taking care
of you when you're sick.

634
00:31:51,539 --> 00:31:52,972
And I'm grateful for it, my wife.

635
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:56,497
It's hard

636
00:31:56,945 --> 00:31:58,105
to pass the test of love.

637
00:31:58,733 --> 00:32:00,719
Yet everyone has to go through it.

638
00:32:02,177 --> 00:32:03,177
It's hard.

639
00:32:04,259 --> 00:32:05,259
It's your turn.

640
00:32:19,497 --> 00:32:22,400
(Little Red Flower Orphanage)
Tou Tou has completely changed.

641
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:24,177
You won't see any of her

642
00:32:24,273 --> 00:32:26,227
former unruly and
mischievous behaviour now.

643
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,790
(One of the reasons
we chose her back then)

644
00:32:28,873 --> 00:32:29,854
(was to see if Xin Zheng)

645
00:32:29,937 --> 00:32:32,452
(could truly uphold the principle
of teaching without discrimination.)

646
00:32:32,537 --> 00:32:34,494
I'll take her to meet you during
the next ancestor worship ceremony.

647
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:36,738
You will be really surprised.

648
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:37,903
Also,

649
00:32:37,986 --> 00:32:40,105
you can completely
set your mind at ease now.

650
00:32:40,537 --> 00:32:42,395
It was under the fate's guidance

651
00:32:42,478 --> 00:32:45,238
to entrust her to you back then.

652
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,880
(Yes,)

653
00:32:47,017 --> 00:32:48,377
I understand your wish.

654
00:32:48,773 --> 00:32:51,960
Xin Zheng is kind-hearted and generous.

655
00:32:52,273 --> 00:32:55,559
He has imparted
all his knowledge to Tou Tou.

656
00:32:55,806 --> 00:32:56,676
And Tou Tou

657
00:32:56,759 --> 00:32:58,320
is fully qualified

658
00:32:58,537 --> 00:33:00,096
to become the successor.

659
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:03,455
Ren Xin Zheng, his name means
righteousness and ambitious aspirations.

660
00:33:03,538 --> 00:33:05,219
When I saw him, I knew that

661
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:07,519
under his guidance,

662
00:33:07,658 --> 00:33:09,456
(Tou Tou would definitely
walk the right path.)

663
00:33:09,539 --> 00:33:10,659
You're absolutely right.

664
00:33:11,497 --> 00:33:13,537
There's another matter
I'd like to discuss with you.

665
00:33:13,632 --> 00:33:16,276
It's about the documents
containing Tou Tou's real identity.

666
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:18,560
I don't think there's a need
to keep any copies of it.

667
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:21,036
I will destroy the copy I have,

668
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:22,119
is that all right?

669
00:33:22,577 --> 00:33:23,774
(After handing her over to you,)

670
00:33:23,857 --> 00:33:26,116
(everything about her past)

671
00:33:26,199 --> 00:33:27,937
(in my possession no longer exists.)

672
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,636
You really are an enlightened person.

673
00:33:31,719 --> 00:33:33,119
You are much more insightful than me.

674
00:33:33,897 --> 00:33:36,797
At that time, I was concerned
that she could be a lost cause,

675
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,357
so I saw these documents

676
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,079
as my fallback plan.

677
00:33:41,199 --> 00:33:42,276
Looking back,

678
00:33:42,359 --> 00:33:44,319
I realise my level of enlightenment
was low.

679
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:47,116
Regardless of who her parents are,

680
00:33:47,199 --> 00:33:50,417
I believe that she is fully qualified
to take on this role.

681
00:33:50,959 --> 00:33:55,040
She is the rightful successor of
the Jiang family's acupuncture sect.

682
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:56,433
Tou Tou.

683
00:34:00,617 --> 00:34:01,617
Okay.

684
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:06,156
My parents

685
00:34:06,239 --> 00:34:08,759
are coming to celebrate
the Dragon Boat Festival with me.

686
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,680
I told them before that I found a job.

687
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,956
When you see them,

688
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:16,557
can you tell them that

689
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,000
I'm working at the medical centre?

690
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:20,519
And that it's a permanent position?

691
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,039
Are you asking me to lie?

692
00:34:25,279 --> 00:34:26,196
Let me tell you,

693
00:34:26,279 --> 00:34:27,716
I never lie.

694
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:29,799
And I won't lie for you.

695
00:34:32,352 --> 00:34:33,793
And who is this young girl?

696
00:34:34,897 --> 00:34:36,762
This is the successor of
the Jiang family's acupuncture sect,

697
00:34:36,845 --> 00:34:37,926
Sun Tou Tou.

698
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,960
So, she's my junior sister.

699
00:34:48,039 --> 00:34:48,956
Don't worry.

700
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:51,799
I will take care of everything.

701
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,759
Okay, bye.

702
00:34:55,879 --> 00:34:57,556
Li Quan, are you here to see Mr Wu?

703
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,640
Why didn't you go in?

704
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:02,039
Please come in.

705
00:35:02,617 --> 00:35:04,797
Mr Wu, I've printed out
the documents for the meeting later.

706
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,079
-Let me know if you need anything else.
-Okay.

707
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:12,677
Okay.

708
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,239
I need copies of this material.

709
00:35:14,337 --> 00:35:16,163
One for everyone.
We need it for the meeting later.

710
00:35:16,246 --> 00:35:17,246
Got it.

711
00:35:38,367 --> 00:35:39,367
How can I help you?

712
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:42,780
Is it true?

713
00:35:45,097 --> 00:35:47,176
What do you mean?

714
00:35:49,306 --> 00:35:52,212
Sun Tou Tou isn't the successor
of the Jiang family's acupuncture sect,

715
00:35:53,097 --> 00:35:54,097
is she?

716
00:35:56,673 --> 00:35:58,326
Does this have anything to do with you?

717
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,400
It does.

718
00:36:03,177 --> 00:36:04,177
I used to think

719
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:06,160
that I didn't have any inheritance,

720
00:36:06,507 --> 00:36:08,279
that I didn't come from a good family,

721
00:36:08,377 --> 00:36:10,720
so I couldn't reach the heights
like all of you.

722
00:36:12,097 --> 00:36:13,310
But what about Sun Tou Tou?

723
00:36:14,173 --> 00:36:15,173
She is nobody.

724
00:36:16,073 --> 00:36:18,073
Why could she be the chosen successor?

725
00:36:19,697 --> 00:36:20,697
And what about me?

726
00:36:21,485 --> 00:36:23,326
I studied diligently.

727
00:36:23,539 --> 00:36:24,699
I got into university,

728
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:27,817
pursued a postgraduate degree,

729
00:36:28,886 --> 00:36:31,166
but I'm not accepted in this city.

730
00:36:34,217 --> 00:36:36,640
If you can choose any random person

731
00:36:36,907 --> 00:36:38,306
to be the successor,

732
00:36:38,846 --> 00:36:41,126
then why can't it be me?

733
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:44,216
Is it the will of God
for people like you

734
00:36:44,299 --> 00:36:45,694
to oppress poor students like us,

735
00:36:45,777 --> 00:36:47,736
manipulating everything at your whim?

736
00:36:49,617 --> 00:36:50,617
Li Quan,

737
00:36:52,479 --> 00:36:54,560
haven't I helped you enough?

738
00:36:57,297 --> 00:37:00,057
You can't expect me to do

739
00:37:01,007 --> 00:37:02,998
illegal things just to help you, right?

740
00:37:03,177 --> 00:37:05,018
What illegal things
have I asked you to do?

741
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:08,226
I just want you to get our medicine
covered by medical insurance.

742
00:37:08,337 --> 00:37:09,934
It's such a small favour,
and yet you won't help me.

743
00:37:10,017 --> 00:37:11,924
You could easily change

744
00:37:12,007 --> 00:37:13,327
Sun Tou Tou's life.

745
00:37:14,137 --> 00:37:16,050
Why are you willing
to help her but not me?

746
00:37:17,577 --> 00:37:18,577
Zhao Li Quan,

747
00:37:19,452 --> 00:37:20,452
I'm warning you,

748
00:37:21,159 --> 00:37:23,800
I haven't done anything wrong to you.

749
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:25,357
Whatever I'm doing,

750
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,117
I don't need to explain anything to you.

751
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,880
I respected you so much!
Why did you deceive me?

752
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:34,079
I respected you,
felt grateful towards you.

753
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:38,279
I held you in high regard,
You were like shining beacons

754
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:40,476
of goodness in my heart.

755
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:42,117
I wanted to become like you!

756
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,397
But what about you?

757
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,337
What have you been doing behind my back?

758
00:37:45,799 --> 00:37:47,360
Why are you willing
to help Sun Tou Tou?

759
00:37:47,446 --> 00:37:48,886
Who is she?

760
00:37:49,612 --> 00:37:50,612
Li Quan,

761
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:53,680
things are not as you think.

762
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:56,160
You're too agitated now.

763
00:37:56,777 --> 00:37:58,574
This isn't the right time
to discuss about this.

764
00:37:58,657 --> 00:37:59,778
Let's talk again

765
00:38:00,713 --> 00:38:01,752
when you've calmed down.

766
00:38:03,734 --> 00:38:05,080
I'm already late for my meeting.

767
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,196
You can go. I will find out

768
00:38:08,279 --> 00:38:09,276
who Sun Tou Tou really is

769
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:11,227
and why she's worth
all this help from you.

770
00:38:12,359 --> 00:38:13,637
What are you doing?

771
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,799
Get away from me! Now you're scared.

772
00:38:38,597 --> 00:38:41,026
Somebody, help!

773
00:38:41,317 --> 00:38:42,440
Help!

774
00:38:42,537 --> 00:38:43,676
-What's wrong?
-What's wrong?

775
00:38:43,759 --> 00:38:45,160
-Mr Wu!
-Mr Wu, are you okay?

776
00:38:45,279 --> 00:38:47,205
-What happened to Mr Wu?
-What happened, Li Quan?

777
00:38:51,977 --> 00:38:53,974
(Jiangzhou People's Hospital)

778
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,000
His situation is not good.

779
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,519
From the scans,

780
00:39:04,166 --> 00:39:06,287
his frontal lobe blood vessels
are deformed.

781
00:39:06,537 --> 00:39:08,494
His sudden fall has triggered
a cerebral haemorrhage.

782
00:39:08,577 --> 00:39:10,056
(Shen Xin)
The bleeding is significant.

783
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:11,457
Even with surgery,

784
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:14,039
the prognosis may not be favourable.

785
00:39:14,679 --> 00:39:17,199
Shen Xin, we are close friends.

786
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,906
So, I will just be honest with you.

787
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,759
This surgery,

788
00:39:21,533 --> 00:39:22,533
it's better to give up

789
00:39:22,879 --> 00:39:23,879
than to perform it.

790
00:39:24,359 --> 00:39:26,240
Giving up might bring short-term pain,

791
00:39:27,337 --> 00:39:28,843
but if we operate
and he ends up in a vegetative state,

792
00:39:28,926 --> 00:39:30,047
lying in coma forever,

793
00:39:30,286 --> 00:39:31,605
your family will have to suffer.

794
00:39:37,712 --> 00:39:38,793
Listen to me,

795
00:39:39,285 --> 00:39:41,406
I've been friends with Wu
for many years.

796
00:39:41,617 --> 00:39:42,663
This is hard for me too.

797
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:45,390
But you need to be rational.

798
00:39:45,474 --> 00:39:46,735
If you let him go now,

799
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:48,799
he won't experience any more pain.

800
00:39:49,319 --> 00:39:51,319
It will be difficult for your family,

801
00:39:51,954 --> 00:39:54,633
but time will heal you.

802
00:39:55,137 --> 00:39:56,579
We are all medical professionals.

803
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:58,119
I suppose

804
00:39:58,747 --> 00:40:00,292
I don't need to say anymore on this.

805
00:40:02,165 --> 00:40:03,325
Thank you, Li.

806
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,039
I understand everything

807
00:40:07,759 --> 00:40:08,759
you just said.

808
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:10,519
However,

809
00:40:11,799 --> 00:40:13,680
I can't give up on Wu.

810
00:40:15,175 --> 00:40:16,894
My mother-in-law is waiting outside.

811
00:40:16,977 --> 00:40:17,756
She has taken her blood pressure pill,

812
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:19,600
but her blood pressure
is still over 200.

813
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,760
Tell me,

814
00:40:21,526 --> 00:40:23,165
do you have the courage to go out

815
00:40:23,799 --> 00:40:25,157
and tell her to give up on her son?

816
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,036
We might...

817
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:27,599
We might lose two lives then.

818
00:40:38,406 --> 00:40:39,406
Don't worry.

819
00:40:40,657 --> 00:40:41,657
If the surgery fails,

820
00:40:42,479 --> 00:40:43,479
I won't blame you.

821
00:40:44,053 --> 00:40:45,572
The worst case scenario is

822
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,880
he will become a vegetable, right?

823
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,800
I will accept it.

824
00:41:00,507 --> 00:41:02,104
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

825
00:41:02,187 --> 00:41:03,587

traditional Chinese medicine books)
