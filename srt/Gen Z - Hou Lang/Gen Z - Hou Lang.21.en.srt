1
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,720
Mind your feet.

2
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,040
Be careful.

3
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,680
We found it.

4
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,799
Tian Zhen.

5
00:00:57,393 --> 00:00:58,559
You saw it, right?

6
00:00:59,985 --> 00:01:01,239
We have to be careful
when we harvest it.

7
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,677
Our trip will be in vain
if we sever its root.

8
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,640
And, you have to be quick.

9
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,557
We might not be able to go back
if the weather changes.

10
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,440
That won't happen.

11
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,800
It already rained today.

12
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,240
That's why I dare to come here.

13
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,880
Mind your feet. Follow me.

14
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:14,800
Okay.

15
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,480
Be careful.

16
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,560
Hey, be careful.

17
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,240
Be careful.

18
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,400
Okay.

19
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,440
Be careful.

20
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,520
Good.

21
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,800
Mission accomplished.

22
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,080
Hold it horizontally.

23
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,240
The root is really long.

24
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,280
Yeah.

25
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,120
Its root is really long.

26
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,037
I've never seen such a long root before.

27
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,120
It's definitely a treasure.

28
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,400
What's wrong?

29
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,160
What's wrong?

30
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,640
It's nothing.

31
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,120
It's nothing.

32
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,040
Don't move.

33
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,560
Don't move.

34
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,560
Give me your hand.

35
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,880
Slowly.

36
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,080
Watch out!

37
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,600
What's wrong?

38
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,240
You were bitten by a snake.

39
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,557
-Don't!
-Suck it out!

40
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,680
You watched too many dramas.

41
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,040
What should we do then?

42
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,157
Call for help!

43
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,400
Go back!

44
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,597
I'm lost!

45
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,477
I don't know how to get back!

46
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,917
What if the snake bites me

47
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,357
-after this?
-Call someone!

48
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,160
-There's no signal here!
-Tou Tou, look for a rope.

49
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,600
-Look for a rope.
-I have one.

50
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,520
I have a rope.

51
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,840
Wait.

52
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,600
Calm down. I'm fine.

53
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,160
Calm down.

54
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,117
Stop trembling!

55
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,160
I...

56
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,880
Tie the knot tightly.

57
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,717
Luckily, it didn't bite you.

58
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,800
When there's a snake,

59
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,400
the antidote will be nearby.

60
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,680
Here.

61
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,760
Tian Zhen?

62
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,840
Ren Tian Zhen?

63
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,880
Tian Zhen,

64
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,520
you mustn't sleep now!

65
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,877
Wake up!

66
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,920
Open your eyes!

67
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,160
This is...

68
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,240
Come here!

69
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,360
Apply pressure onto his wound!

70
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,160
Hurry!

71
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,040
Tou Tou!

72
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,637
We're here!

73
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,157
Over here!

74
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,917
Over here!

75
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,960
Over here!

76
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,400
Over here!

77
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,600
Ren Tian Zhen?

78
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,680
Over here!

79
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,480
Keep an eye on the water.

80
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,560
How is he?

81
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,920
Luckily, Tou Tou

82
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,200
tended to his wound in time.

83
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,640
His internal organs weren't damaged.

84
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,840
That's great.

85
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,117
By the way,

86
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,720
the ginseng farmer just brewed

87
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,880
this antidote.

88
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,840
Feed him.

89
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,280
Luckily, it didn't bite you.

90
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,920
Tou Tou,

91
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,920
luckily, it didn't bite you.

92
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,160
Tian Zhen's life isn't in danger now.

93
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,600
Everyone, don't worry.

94
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,760
Stop right there.

95
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,680
Where are you going?

96
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,157
I'm going to check on him.

97
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,120
Check what?

98
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,437
I'm going to check on him.

99
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,080
Are you going to check on his dead body?

100
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,797
Mr Ren had emphasized
time and time again

101
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,717
that you guys

102
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,000
weren't allowed to dig for ginseng.

103
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,560
It's fine that you disobeyed him.

104
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,200
But how dare you coerce Tian Zhen

105
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,440
into joining you?

106
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,037
He's my only son!

107
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,760
-That's not it.
-His life is connected to mine!

108
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,080
It was Mr Liu.

109
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,400
Mr Liu, he...

110
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,560
Mr Liu?

111
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,200
You mean Liu Chang Qing?

112
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,917
What benefit did he give you

113
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,760
for you to bring Tian Zhen along?

114
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,640
Do you know

115
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,960
that Liu Chang Qing

116
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,000
has already left the mountain
with the ginseng

117
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,280
that my son risked his life to gather?

118
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,600
Ling Lan,

119
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,680
calm down.

120
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,160
What's wrong?

121
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,880
Did I say something wrong?

122
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,400
It's all her fault!

123
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,917
My son is an obedient boy.

124
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,760
Why would he try to harvest ginseng
without permission?

125
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,637
He wouldn't have been bitten by a snake

126
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,680
and ended up like this
if it weren't for her!

127
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,720
Ling Lan.

128
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,080
Sun Tou Tou.

129
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,240
Sun Tou Tou!

130
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,160
Leave immediately.

131
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,200
Ling Lan.

132
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,117
If she doesn't leave,

133
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,040
I'll leave!

134
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,480
Master,

135
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:49,880
it wasn't me.

136
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,397
It was Liu Chang Qing.

137
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,437
Liu Chang Qing said

138
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,757
if we didn't harvest the ginseng,
we would...

139
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,720
Shut up!

140
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,800
Don't chase me away.

141
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,640
Please don't chase me away!

142
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,637
Please don't chase me away!

143
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,880
Please don't chase me away!

144
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,320
Please don't chase me away!

145
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,120
Please don't chase me away!

146
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,200
It wasn't me!

147
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,680
It was Liu Chang Qing!

148
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:11,920
Tou Tou.

149
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,800
Leave the mountain.

150
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,480
Escort her down the mountain.

151
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,560
Tou Tou,

152
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,560
don't be too worried.

153
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,517
Madam is just worried

154
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,640
about Tian Zhen.

155
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,997
She said that out of spite.

156
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,760
I'm sure she wasn't sincere
in chasing you away.

157
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,560
You should go back.

158
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,720
Tou Tou, I'm serious.

159
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,320
I believe you too.
I'm sure you didn't do it on purpose.

160
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,120
I'm serious too.

161
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,040
You should head back.

162
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,080
I can get down the mountain myself.

163
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,880
You should check on Tian Zhen.

164
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,957
Although they said he was fine,

165
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,077
I didn't check on him myself.

166
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,640
I'm still worried about him.

167
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,800
Head back

168
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,360
and tell him to call me.

169
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,280
You hear me?

170
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,000
Will you be fine?

171
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,280
Of course.

172
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,000
It's not like I was bitten by a snake.

173
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,677
I'll be fine.

174
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,640
Head back and check on him.

175
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,720
I'll be waiting

176
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,517
for your news

177
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,480
at the village down the mountain.

178
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,520
Got it?

179
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,280
Go now.

180
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,200
Go ahead.

181
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,120
Remember to tell him to call me.

182
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,880
You have to be careful, okay?

183
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,920
Tell the guys not to worry about me.

184
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,600
Okay.

185
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,000
This is an unexpected calamity.

186
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,480
No, it's a man-made disaster.

187
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,160
We don't know what happened for sure.

188
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,040
We mustn't jump to conclusions.

189
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,560
Tian Zhen.

190
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,320
Tian Zhen?

191
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,280
Are you awake?

192
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,440
Mum.

193
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,520
What's the matter?

194
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,440
I'm a little thirsty.

195
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,760
Have some salt water.

196
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,280
I'm sure he's starving.

197
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,520
I'll make him some food.

198
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,360
Slow down.

199
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,280
Take a small sip.

200
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:41,840
Here.

201
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,040
Mum.

202
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,080
Where's the ginseng?

203
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,760
You're still thinking about the ginseng?

204
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,920
Liu Chang Qing left the mountain

205
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,600
together with it long ago.

206
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,720
You're truly

207
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,320
dumb.

208
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,357
How could you do

209
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,240
whatever people tell you to do?

210
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,520
You're so silly.

211
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,120
I...

212
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,480
I...

213
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,760
Slowly.

214
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,520
I'm fine now.

215
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,680
Don't...

216
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,480
Don't worry about me.

217
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,960
Don't worry about you?

218
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,840
You almost died, you know?

219
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,760
Mr Qiu said

220
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,360
you were bitten by
a Vipera russelli siamensis.

221
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,280
My goodness.

222
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,680
Tou Tou.

223
00:15:41,439 --> 00:15:42,437
Tou Tou.

224
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,400
Stop calling for her.

225
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,880
I've already chased her away.

226
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,840
You...

227
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,360
You chased her away?

228
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,360
Mum,

229
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,360
I was the one who promised Mr Liu

230
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,800
that I would harvest the ginseng.

231
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,040
Even now, you're still

232
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,920
trying to defend her?

233
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,400
This time,

234
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,480
it...

235
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,200
It wasn't Tou Tou's fault.

236
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,520
She insisted on

237
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,760
following Dad's instructions.

238
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,800
It was my fault.

239
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,960
I wanted to retain the apprentice class.

240
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,480
The apprentice class

241
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,880
is Dad's life's work after all.

242
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,120
That's why I promised Mr Liu to do so.

243
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,200
Tou Tou

244
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,037
joined me

245
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,680
in order to help me out.

246
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,320
Mum.

247
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,320
You...

248
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,120
You maligned Tou Tou.

249
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,520
Kid,

250
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,720
you risked your life

251
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,480
just to fulfil his request?

252
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,640
Mum.

253
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,680
You...

254
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,840
This time, you mustn't
chase Tou Tou away.

255
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,240
This accident

256
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,880
was my responsibility.

257
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,280
Ling Lan,

258
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,280
I heard what Tian Zhen said just now.

259
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,880
Keeping one's emotions in check

260
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,560
is something we have
to practice forever.

261
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,200
You lost control of your emotions today.

262
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,760
Tou Tou.

263
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,760
Where is she right now?

264
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,440
Tou Tou isn't here.

265
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,440
Your mother chased her away.

266
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,880
What are you doing?

267
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,560
I'm going to look for her.

268
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,760
How could you look for her
in this state?

269
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,080
You...

270
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,157
You should rest first.

271
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,200
Mum.

272
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,320
Tou Tou is bad at directions.

273
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,637
She got lost once

274
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,080
when she entered the mountains.

275
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,120
I'm worried about her.

276
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,160
Calm down.

277
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,400
We can call her.

278
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,597
Hao Hao!

279
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,280
Is anyone there? Help!

280
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,280
Help!

281
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,440
Hao Hao!

282
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,480
Help!

283
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,760
Hao Hao!

284
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,160
Hao Hao!

285
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,037
Miss, please save my son!

286
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,360
Hurry up!

287
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,000
He fell unconscious!

288
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,080
Hurry!

289
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,080
Does he have epilepsy?

290
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:13,997
I don't know!

291
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,600
He has never been like this before!

292
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,680
He only became like this
when I sent him to school today!

293
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:20,960
What are you doing?

294
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,357
I'm a doctor. Listen to me.

295
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,320
Okay.

296
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,560
Son?

297
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,280
Her phone is switched off.

298
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,320
Mum.

299
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,320
How long has it been since
Tou Tou left the place?

300
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,160
Mr Ren, are you looking for me?

301
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,880
What are you doing here?

302
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,517
Didn't I instruct you

303
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,600
to escort Tou Tou down the mountain?

304
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,077
She didn't want me to escort her.

305
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,120
She told me to come back
and check on Tian Zhen.

306
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,880
But...

307
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,440
But how could you let her

308
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,320
leave by herself?

309
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,597
There's only one road
to get down the mountain.

310
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,880
She should be fine.

311
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,560
Besides, she said she would wait for us
in the village below the mountain.

312
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,560
What's the matter?

313
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,600
Tou Tou.

314
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,920
Tou Tou switched off her phone.

315
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,240
We couldn't reach her.

316
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,440
She spent the entire night
in the yard last night.

317
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,880
I think her phone ran out of battery.

318
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,520
Mum,

319
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,680
help me up.

320
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,160
Miss, how is he?

321
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:52,797
His pulse is stable now.

322
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,000
His life is out of danger at the moment.

323
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,117
This is great.

324
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,197
-Thank you, Miss.
-You should

325
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,960
still send him to the hospital
for a check-up.

326
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,357
Epilepsy needs to be treated.

327
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,680
He won't be this lucky next time.

328
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,120
You're right.

329
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,800
There's transport that can send us
to the town hospital in our village.

330
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,200
What are you waiting for then?
Hurry and go.

331
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,276
You're right.

332
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,476
-Come on.
-Son.

333
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,640
-Okay.
-Up.

334
00:21:10,724 --> 00:21:11,957
Hold the rod for him.

335
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,276
That's his treasure.

336
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,600
Thank you.

337
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,440
My child,

338
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,520
hang in there.

339
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,040
Miss!

340
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:21,960
-Hurry up!
-Coming!

341
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,166
Hang in there!

342
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,880
Mr Ren, Mr Qiu,

343
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,840
we went to the village
to inquire about her.

344
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,440
There was no one in the reception house.

345
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,360
-Yeah.
-There was no one in the hotel too.

346
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,600
We asked the ticket office too.

347
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,280
They said they didn't see her.

348
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,280
Are you sure?

349
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,400
Yes.

350
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,640
The vehicle that was heading to the city
departed this morning.

351
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:39,960
They didn't see her.

352
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,477
Where can she be then?

353
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,640
It'll be dusk soon.

354
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,957
And, she's a girl

355
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,560
trapped within the forest.

356
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,437
What if something happens to her?

357
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,517
It's all my fault.

358
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,280
Ling Lan, calm down.

359
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,040
Mr Qiu,

360
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,520
you and Ling Lan

361
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:57,800
can bring the students

362
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,920
and catch the next ride.

363
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,237
You guys should head back.

364
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,320
No! I'm going to look for Tou Tou.

365
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,320
Don't worry about her.

366
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,920
Alright. You guys.

367
00:22:05,062 --> 00:22:06,077
Li Quan.

368
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,880
Stay here with me.
We'll wait for Tou Tou.

369
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,166
Don't worry.

370
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,713
Dad,

371
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,680
Mum,

372
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,160
I'll stay here too.

373
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,760
Tian Zhen will stay.

374
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,040
Don't worry.

375
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,720
I'm here.

376
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,240
Li Quan,

377
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,440
look after Madam.

378
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,560
Yes, Master.

379
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,520
You guys must apologise to Tou Tou

380
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,397
on my behalf if you see her.

381
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,440
Alright.

382
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,160
Don't catch the night ride.

383
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,080
You guys must reach home by nightfall.

384
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,240
Take care of yourself.

385
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,560
Just go.

386
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,557
-Miss.
-Wait, mister.

387
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,717
-Miss.
-This is nothing.

388
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,757
-Miss, wait!
-Don't do this.

389
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,720
Miss!

390
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,077
I already told you.
Don't be so courteous.

391
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,160
Miss, I haven't got to thank you yet.

392
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,360
I'm lucky

393
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,040
to encounter you today.

394
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,560
Coincidentally, you're a doctor.

395
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,400
I'm so thankful to you.

396
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,880
You saved his life.

397
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,797
It's fine.

398
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,117
As long as the kid is safe.

399
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,600
Besides,

400
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,680
doctors are meant to save lives.

401
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,960
Although that's the case,

402
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,200
and this may be nothing to you,

403
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,440
you're still

404
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,400
my son's benefactor.

405
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,997
I don't know how

406
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,437
I can repay you.

407
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,960
Let me kowtow to you.

408
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,717
Mister!

409
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,160
This won't do.

410
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,160
Listen.

411
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,597
It's fine as long as the kid is safe.

412
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,600
You don't need to...

413
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,720
What's wrong?

414
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,920
If you truly wish to repay me,

415
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,800
can you give that to me?

416
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,320
You mean this?

417
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,077
This is inappropriate. It's cheap.

418
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,040
-My son just picked it up.
-It's not.

419
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,120
To me, this is more valuable than money.

420
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,600
-Really?
-Yeah.

421
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,680
Alright then.

422
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,320
Sorry about this.

423
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,197
Miss,

424
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,637
why don't you join us for dinner?

425
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,560
No, thanks.

426
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,120
Go and check on your child.

427
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,960
Mister, you should check on your child.

428
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,280
Miss,

429
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,960
you're a kind Samaritan.

430
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,800
Thank you.

431
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,280
Thank you.

432
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:23,840
Thank you.

433
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,520
Thank you.

434
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,680
Thank you.

435
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,720
Thank you!

436
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,360
It's all thanks to you.

437
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,360
My son was lucky.

438
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,800
I'm lucky to encounter you today.

439
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,240
Coincidentally, you're a doctor.

440
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,080
I'm so thankful to you.

441
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,640
You saved his life.

442
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,720
Hello?

443
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,760
Sun Tou Tou, do you think it's fun
to vanish like that?

444
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,720
Where are you right now?

445
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,677
Wait. Are you okay now?

446
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,680
You...

447
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,600
I'm at the town's health centre now.

448
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,240
Hello?

449
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,400
Tou Tou!

450
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:15,960
Tou Tou!

451
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,000
Tou Tou!

452
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,437
Was it fun to disappear on us like that?

453
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,677
-I didn't!
-Why did you run away?

454
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,517
-We were worried.
-I didn't disappear.

455
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,600
Do you know how many people
are worried about you?

456
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,320
Are you okay now?

457
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,360
I'm fine now.

458
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,200
My mother is worried about you.

459
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,880
What are you doing here?

460
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,240
Did you fall and get hurt?

461
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,680
If so, what are you doing here?

462
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,560
Tell me what happened.
I'll punish you later.

463
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,040
I met a kid in the middle of the road.

464
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,360
I saved him

465
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,760
and sent him to the health centre.

466
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,400
His father...

467
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,720
His father called me a doctor.

468
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,197
That was my first time

469
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,440
hearing someone refer to me as a doctor.

470
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,040
Master,

471
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,357
I think

472
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,800
I've found my calling.

473
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,040
I wish to be a doctor.

474
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,637
I truly wish

475
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,560
to be an excellent doctor.

476
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,480
Master,

477
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,880
I've decided that you're my master.

478
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,120
You'll be my master

479
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,840
for the rest of my life.

480
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,800
So, please teach me.

481
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,840
I'll definitely study hard under you

482
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:52,960
and strive to improve myself.

483
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,680
Once I master the required skills,

484
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,440
I'll definitely spread the name
of our sect.

485
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,160
Please believe me.

486
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,320
I will accomplish my mission

487
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,920
and not let our sect down.

488
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,040
I don't expect that much from you.

489
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,720
And, I don't need you

490
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,360
to bring honour to our ancestors.

491
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,480
I only hope

492
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,240
that you won't tell anyone my name

493
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,200
when you get into trouble in the future.

494
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,440
Is that all?

495
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,040
Yes.

496
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,080
Alright.

497
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,440
Words alone are no proof.

498
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,920
We need to write it down.

499
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,040
You don't trust me?

500
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,480
That's not it.

501
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,360
Roubecca said this before.

502
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,997
If students of the apprentice class
wish to treat people,

503
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,800
they have to sign a contract.

504
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,280
After the required amount
of training time,

505
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,760
we need to take the apprentice exam
and pass it.

506
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,520
Only then can we practice medicine.

507
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,040
Before this,

508
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,157
I wasn't paying attention at all.

509
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,317
Now, I wish to study hard.

510
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,557
We should still write it down.

511
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,960
Only then, I can have peace of mind.

512
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,800
We wrote it down long ago.

513
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,997
We already signed the note

514
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,200
during our first encounter.

515
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,800
When?

516
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:34,920
You forgot.

517
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,840
Is that so?

518
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,000
Read your ID number for me.

519
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,440
3-1-1-1

520
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,917
9-9-7-0-8

521
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,400
0-9-4-1-2-0.

522
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,160
You're an experienced
TCM practitioner indeed.

523
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,360
I can't read

524
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,800
a single word you wrote.

525
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,440
Sign it.

526
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,040
Where?

527
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,240
Here.

528
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,280
Keep this copy.

529
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,397
Keep it well.

530
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,560
It'll be of use in the future.

531
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,600
Really?

532
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,000
Can I sue you with this
if you don't pay up?

533
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,397
That's not it.

534
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,920
That was not an official document.

535
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,680
It wasn't a formal one.

536
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,480
You have to at least

537
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,200
give me a printed version.

538
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,160
That's exuberant.

539
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,400
Alright, let's go back.

540
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,680
Master, wait.

541
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,360
Please keep this.

542
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,997
Why are you giving me a broken rod?

543
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,040
It's not.

544
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,757
This is the consultation fee

545
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,800
I received from my first patient.

546
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,720
People say

547
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,680
that we must hand
our first consultation fee

548
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,000
to our masters, right?

549
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:10,920
Okay.

550
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,240
I'll keep it for now.

551
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,240
This is good.

552
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,317
I can use it to beat you up

553
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,840
when you commit mistakes in the future.

554
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,080
Alright.

555
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,760
Master,

556
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,080
this rod

557
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,237
is at least

558
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,320
worth ten yuan, right?

559
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,720
This broken rod

560
00:31:31,193 --> 00:31:32,126
is worth ten yuan?

561
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:33,198
-You can keep it.
-Wait.

562
00:31:33,281 --> 00:31:34,597
-No, thanks.
-It's not like I want money from you.

563
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,797
Why are you so stingy?

564
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,237
Wait. Just hold it.

565
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,573
We can talk this over.

566
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,160
The money box.

567
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,840
You should put ten yuan
into the money box.

568
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,840
I saved someone,

569
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,240
right?

570
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,320
Come, I'll carry it for you.

571
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,560
Master, is this okay?

572
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,200
Put ten yuan for me.

573
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,640
Is it comfortable?

574
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,040
How's the strength?

575
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,320
Tian Zhen, take my bag!

576
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,200
What's going on?

577
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,077
What's wrong with Liu Chang Qing?

578
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,640
-What's going on?
-I don't know.

579
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,320
Hasn't Mr Liu dealt with the issue yet?

580
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,600
That's impossible.
He already took the ginseng.

581
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,837
Put that down!

582
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,360
We bought the beds with our money.

583
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,277
-You...
-We're leaving them here.

584
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,320
Hurry and move them away.

585
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,760
What?

586
00:32:35,291 --> 00:32:36,328
Everyone, come and see.

587
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:37,729
They're already starting
to clear the dorm.

588
00:32:37,813 --> 00:32:39,413
How could they do so?
Are they seizing our place?

589
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,520
Didn't Liu Chang Qing tell you anything?

590
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,960
Master, call him.

591
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,800
Call him right now.

592
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,720
Sorry about this.

593
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,480
Sorry about this.

594
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,600
Professor Ren, Ms Song.

595
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,320
I've let all of you down.

596
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,520
Liu,

597
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,597
did you not manage to pay your debt?

598
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,677
Or have you

599
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,560
mortgaged the entire place?

600
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,520
Lu Chang Qing,

601
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,320
where's the ginseng?

602
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,280
Have you delivered it to him?

603
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,840
Speak up!

604
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,077
Tian Zhen risked his life
to get it for you!

605
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,760
What do you mean by keeping quiet?

606
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,960
That ginseng of yours,

607
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,280
I can't return it to you right now.

608
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,837
-I'll kill you!
-Tou Tou!

609
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,960
-Tou Tou!
-I'll kill you!

610
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,120
-I'll kill you!
-Tou Tou!

611
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:38,360
(One day ago)

612
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,920
Mr Liu, over here, please.

613
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,120
Mr Liang.

614
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,760
Mr Liang.

615
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,000
Mr Liang.

616
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,597
I went to the golf club to look for you.

617
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,680
They said you were here.

618
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,677
I play golf on Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday.

619
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,720
I swim on Tuesday,
Thursday, and Saturday.

620
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,760
You're a healthy person indeed.

621
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,757
Here, have a seat.

622
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,720
No, thanks.

623
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,360
Have some water.

624
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,400
It's okay.

625
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,440
Your water is too sacred
for me to drink.

626
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,597
Don't misunderstand me.

627
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,397
I'm not saying that I mind
drinking with your cup.

628
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,757
You're a saint.

629
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,360
This isn't water.

630
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,800
This is gold.

631
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,360
It's just normal drinking water.

632
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:15,960
It's not expensive.

633
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,600
Do you need anything?

634
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,760
You see,

635
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:21,560
I brought a treasure here.

636
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,640
It's a 100-year-old wild ginseng

637
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,717
that I newly harvested

638
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,840
from Changbai Mountain.

639
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,480
I guarantee it's genuine.

640
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,280
Professor Ren had his eyes on it
since ten years ago.

641
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,880
Everyone was protecting it.

642
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,877
I got myself in trouble

643
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,880
when I harvested it.

644
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,680
It was dangerous.

645
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,637
I killed

646
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,000
the venomous snake

647
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,757
with one blow during the crucial moment.

648
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,800
Without me,

649
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,240
Professor Ren's son

650
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,760
would be dead by now.

651
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,480
So, you saved Professor Ren's son.

652
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,920
It's no wonder Professor Ren
gave this treasure to you.

653
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,760
Not to me, to you.

654
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,840
Professor Ren said

655
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,840
this was for you.

656
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:01,880
Our TCM industrial park

657
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,117
can only survive

658
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,280
with your help.

659
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,440
Please take a look.

660
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:09,997
You have no idea.

661
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,157
Searching for this ginseng

662
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,800
was harder than mining for gold.

663
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,840
Throughout our journey,

664
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,120
we have to follow

665
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,480
the trees

666
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,600
with markings on it.

667
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,720
Mr Liu, you're too modest.

668
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,000
You're daring indeed.

669
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,320
I'm sure the issue with
the TCM industrial park

670
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,680
will be resolved successfully.

671
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:39,997
Thank you.

672
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,560
So, according to what you said,

673
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,157
Professor Ren's son risked his life
to harvest this for me?

674
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,160
-That's right.
-I don't deserve it.

675
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,200
Wait, Mr Liang.

676
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,280
Mr Liang.

677
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,477
Where can you find

678
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,880
another 100-year-old wild ginseng?

679
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,240
Tell me how old
you want the ginseng to be.

680
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,360
Forget about acquiring investments.

681
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,280
I dare to say

682
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,400
that Mr Liang has blocked
my contact number.

683
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:19,880
Let me ask you this then.

684
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,240
Where's the ginseng?

685
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,077
Where did it go?

686
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,600
You'd better give me
a logical explanation.

687
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,677
That's the creepy part.

688
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,317
I don't know where it went either.

689
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,440
You don't know...

690
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,640
Yes.

691
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,640
I did carry the ginseng
down the mountain personally.

692
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,237
When I reached home,
I found an expensive

693
00:36:36,312 --> 00:36:37,629
and solid wooden box.

694
00:36:37,713 --> 00:36:38,593
I placed it inside.

695
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,757
After that, I kept it in a safe.

696
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,120
It was always there.

697
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,237
But when I opened the box

698
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,600
in front of Mr Liang,

699
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,357
it was gone.

700
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,240
You

701
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,080
-must be lying!
-Did someone take it away?

702
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,557
Who else knows about the ginseng

703
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,080
besides you?

704
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,357
No one else.

705
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,520
Only my assistant and I knew about it.

706
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,877
However, I kept an eye on the box
during the entire meeting.

707
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,880
Your words make no sense.

708
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,600
How could no one else take it? Don't
tell me the ginseng ran away by itself?

709
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,480
I did search for it

710
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,880
online.

711
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,720
They say that ginseng has life.

712
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,560
They can run away by themselves.

713
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:11,757
Think about it.

714
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,957
Many strange phenomena happened.

715
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,277
Maybe it did run away.

716
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,360
It ran away, huh?

717
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,520
Liu Chang Qing,

718
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,720
you'd better stop your nonsensical tale.

719
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,760
Today,

720
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,560
it's either you return
the classroom to us,

721
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,760
return the ginseng to us,

722
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:24,877
or let me

723
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,317
beat you up!

724
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,118
Tou Tou!

725
00:37:27,201 --> 00:37:28,597
-Enough!
-I'll kill you!

726
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,200
Tou Tou!

727
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,277
Master! Don't let him escape!

728
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,197
Tou Tou!

729
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,117
Tou Tou!

730
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,640
He must be lying to us again!

731
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,400
Listen to me.

732
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,320
Let's trust him. He's not lying.

733
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,517
But Master...

734
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,560
Think about it.

735
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,760
He'll incur more losses

736
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,600
if the industrial park is closed off.

737
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,440
What should we do then?

738
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,680
Bone Zhu.

739
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,717
Bone Zhu has a ginseng
that's several decades old.

740
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,760
We can find him.

741
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,720
Let's find him.

742
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,400
It's too late.

743
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,560
I just confirmed it over the phone.

744
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,720
The bank has already initiated
the mortgage procedure.

745
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,760
Even if someone
is willing to invest in it,

746
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,440
it's too late.

747
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,040
Will this happen for real this time?

748
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,040
I guess our class will be cancelled.

749
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,397
I resigned

750
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,480
in order to study here.

751
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,040
I never expected this to happen.

752
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,720
Where should I go now?

753
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,240
We can still study
in the medical centre, right?

754
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,680
Don't be so down.

755
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,997
Theory classes might work,

756
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,480
but not practical classes.

757
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,360
For example, the medical centre
is too small to accommodate

758
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,317
the beds we need to use

759
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,400
for Ms Dong's technique class.

760
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,480
That isn't the main point here.

761
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,200
The main point is our accommodation.

762
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,400
Local students or those who own a house
will not be affected.

763
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,400
But what should we do about
the students from other states?

764
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,640
Don't tell me Mr Ren

765
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,360
is going to let them stay in his house?

766
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,520
Why don't you guys do what I'm doing?

767
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,040
You can get a job on weekdays

768
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,640
and attend the class and
consultation sessions

769
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:11,920
during weekends.

770
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,080
I burnt my boats just
to study medicine here.

771
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,280
I didn't expect this
to happen.

772
00:39:16,593 --> 00:39:17,740
If I go back now,

773
00:39:17,824 --> 00:39:19,224
my wife will definitely mock me.

774
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,040
She said it's tough enough

775
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,520
to sustain your own life
if you study Chinese medicine.

776
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,917
I never expected

777
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,917
a famous figure like Professor Ren

778
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,840
to teach without any classrooms.

779
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,840
Is there still hope for
Chinese medicine?

780
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,037
If I work

781
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,317
as a pharmaceutical representative,

782
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,120
does this count
as my medical qualification?

783
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,760
What's with the despondent attitude?

784
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,560
The class hasn't been cancelled yet.

785
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,480
Besides, look at all the people we have.

786
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,240
I'm sure we can figure something out.

787
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,320
I'll ask my buddies when I get back.

788
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,957
I saw many cheap places

789
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,040
for rent before this.

790
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,200
I'll contact them when I head back.

791
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,600
I'll tell you guys about it
once I confirm the details.

792
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,720
Just wait for my news.

793
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:11,800
Quan,

794
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,317
you're not the unluckiest one here.

795
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,040
At least you have a job
and a place to stay.

796
00:40:16,124 --> 00:40:17,044
You should cherish them.

797
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,437
Ming's Mum, listen.

798
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,400
Le Le likes

799
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,997
Ms Meng the most.

800
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,637
-It's the same for us.
-Yeah, right?

801
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,560
It's been some time since I saw you.

802
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,640
Ms Meng

803
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,680
is pregnant.

804
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,157
Really?

805
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,277
The two-child or three-child policy
is the trend nowadays.

806
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,720
Our government is providing
plenty of benefits to them.

807
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,237
Ms Meng always wanted a child.

808
00:40:56,358 --> 00:40:57,595
Now, she's finally pregnant.

809
00:40:57,679 --> 00:40:58,836
-Yeah.
-It's great news.

810
00:40:58,920 --> 00:40:59,800
What are you doing here?

811
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,637
Tomorrow's the weekend.

812
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,720
I was thinking

813
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,357
that I would bring Le Le back with me

814
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,613
and let him spend the weekend with us.

815
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,480
Do you remember the wrong date?

816
00:41:09,859 --> 00:41:10,960
Le Le will only head

817
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,720
to his father's place next week.

818
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,600
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

819
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,080
(are referenced from relevant
traditional Chinese medicine books)

820
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,640
(Do not use without medical advice)
