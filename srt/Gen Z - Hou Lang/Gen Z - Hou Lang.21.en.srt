00:01:30,704 --> 00:01:34,852
(Gen Z)

2
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,803
(Episode 21)

3
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:55,860
Mind your feet.

4
00:01:57,368 --> 00:01:58,169
Be careful.

5
00:02:26,928 --> 00:02:27,805
We found it.

6
00:02:30,288 --> 00:02:31,071
Tian Zhen.

7
00:02:32,618 --> 00:02:33,446
You saw it, right?

8
00:02:35,369 --> 00:02:36,329
We have to be careful
when we harvest it.

9
00:02:37,169 --> 00:02:38,809
Our trip will be in vain
if we sever its root.

10
00:02:38,888 --> 00:02:39,769
And, you have to be quick.

11
00:02:39,888 --> 00:02:41,769
We might not be able to go back
if the weather changes.

12
00:02:41,769 --> 00:02:42,586
That won't happen.

13
00:02:42,689 --> 00:02:43,928
It already rained today.

14
00:02:44,288 --> 00:02:45,369
That's why I dare to come here.

15
00:02:46,848 --> 00:02:48,009
Mind your feet. Follow me.

16
00:02:49,089 --> 00:02:49,938
Okay.

17
00:02:50,608 --> 00:02:51,610
Be careful.

18
00:03:12,488 --> 00:03:13,689
Hey, be careful.

19
00:03:17,528 --> 00:03:18,360
Be careful.

20
00:03:25,649 --> 00:03:26,532
Okay.

21
00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:28,563
Be careful.

22
00:03:32,808 --> 00:03:33,672
Good.

23
00:03:33,969 --> 00:03:34,928
Mission accomplished.

24
00:03:36,089 --> 00:03:37,208
Hold it horizontally.

25
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:47,368
The root is really long.

26
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:48,414
Yeah.

27
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:50,248
Its root is really long.

28
00:03:55,849 --> 00:03:57,248
I've never seen such a long root before.

29
00:03:57,248 --> 00:03:58,248
It's definitely a treasure.

30
00:04:18,648 --> 00:04:19,547
What's wrong?

31
00:04:23,368 --> 00:04:24,282
What's wrong?

32
00:04:24,929 --> 00:04:25,782
It's nothing.

33
00:04:26,368 --> 00:04:27,266
It's nothing.

34
00:04:33,289 --> 00:04:34,180
Don't move.

35
00:04:36,768 --> 00:04:37,688
Don't move.

36
00:04:42,808 --> 00:04:43,696
Give me your hand.

37
00:04:48,049 --> 00:04:49,032
Slowly.

38
00:04:56,248 --> 00:04:57,227
Watch out!

39
00:04:58,808 --> 00:04:59,743
What's wrong?

40
00:05:03,289 --> 00:05:04,368
You were bitten by a snake.

41
00:05:05,209 --> 00:05:06,689
-Don't!
-Suck it out!

42
00:05:06,769 --> 00:05:07,808
You watched too many dramas.

43
00:05:07,969 --> 00:05:09,168
What should we do then?

44
00:05:09,448 --> 00:05:10,289
Call for help!

45
00:05:10,368 --> 00:05:11,528
Go back!

46
00:05:11,689 --> 00:05:12,808
I'm lost!

47
00:05:12,808 --> 00:05:13,689
I don't know how to get back!

48
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:15,129
What if the snake bites me

49
00:05:15,129 --> 00:05:16,569
-after this?
-Call someone!

50
00:05:16,569 --> 00:05:18,289
-There's no signal here!
-Tou Tou, look for a rope.

51
00:05:18,648 --> 00:05:19,728
-Look for a rope.
-I have one.

52
00:05:20,769 --> 00:05:21,641
I have a rope.

53
00:05:22,042 --> 00:05:22,962
Wait.

54
00:05:26,689 --> 00:05:27,728
Calm down. I'm fine.

55
00:05:28,409 --> 00:05:29,297
Calm down.

56
00:05:31,409 --> 00:05:32,248
Stop trembling!

57
00:05:32,329 --> 00:05:33,282
I...

58
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,032
Tie the knot tightly.

59
00:05:45,769 --> 00:05:46,929
Luckily, it didn't bite you.

60
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:47,929
When there's a snake,

61
00:05:48,168 --> 00:05:49,528
the antidote will be nearby.

62
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:10,805
Here.

63
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,914
Tian Zhen?

64
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:20,985
Ren Tian Zhen?

65
00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:23,024
Tian Zhen,

66
00:06:23,328 --> 00:06:24,648
you mustn't sleep now!

67
00:06:24,768 --> 00:06:26,088
Wake up!

68
00:06:26,088 --> 00:06:27,048
Open your eyes!

69
00:06:29,328 --> 00:06:30,282
This is...

70
00:06:30,528 --> 00:06:31,391
Come here!

71
00:06:31,569 --> 00:06:32,485
Apply pressure onto his wound!

72
00:06:33,409 --> 00:06:34,282
Hurry!

73
00:06:49,648 --> 00:06:51,169
Tou Tou!

74
00:06:52,928 --> 00:06:53,849
We're here!

75
00:06:53,849 --> 00:06:55,368
Over here!

76
00:06:55,368 --> 00:06:57,129
Over here!

77
00:06:57,129 --> 00:06:58,086
Over here!

78
00:06:58,609 --> 00:07:00,528
Over here!

79
00:07:01,729 --> 00:07:02,750
Ren Tian Zhen?

80
00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:04,836
Over here!

81
00:07:47,689 --> 00:07:48,609
Keep an eye on the water.

82
00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:24,680
How is he?

83
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:27,048
Luckily, Tou Tou

84
00:08:27,648 --> 00:08:29,328
tended to his wound in time.

85
00:08:29,689 --> 00:08:30,768
His internal organs weren't damaged.

86
00:08:32,048 --> 00:08:32,969
That's great.

87
00:08:33,467 --> 00:08:34,303
By the way,

88
00:08:34,328 --> 00:08:35,849
the ginseng farmer just brewed

89
00:08:36,009 --> 00:08:37,009
this antidote.

90
00:08:37,129 --> 00:08:37,993
Feed him.

91
00:09:18,328 --> 00:09:19,409
Luckily, it didn't bite you.

92
00:09:23,169 --> 00:09:24,055
Tou Tou,

93
00:09:24,729 --> 00:09:26,048
luckily, it didn't bite you.

94
00:10:26,088 --> 00:10:27,289
Tian Zhen's life isn't in danger now.

95
00:10:27,929 --> 00:10:28,729
Everyone, don't worry.

96
00:10:38,049 --> 00:10:38,899
Stop right there.

97
00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:42,809
Where are you going?

98
00:10:45,328 --> 00:10:46,369
I'm going to check on him.

99
00:10:46,369 --> 00:10:47,243
Check what?

100
00:10:47,528 --> 00:10:48,568
I'm going to check on him.

101
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,208
Are you going to check on his dead body?

102
00:10:54,809 --> 00:10:57,008
Mr Ren had emphasized
time and time again

103
00:10:57,008 --> 00:10:57,929
that you guys

104
00:10:57,929 --> 00:11:00,128
weren't allowed to dig for ginseng.

105
00:11:00,249 --> 00:11:01,688
It's fine that you disobeyed him.

106
00:11:02,849 --> 00:11:04,328
But how dare you coerce Tian Zhen

107
00:11:04,969 --> 00:11:06,568
into joining you?

108
00:11:07,648 --> 00:11:09,249
He's my only son!

109
00:11:09,249 --> 00:11:10,888
-That's not it.
-His life is connected to mine!

110
00:11:11,249 --> 00:11:12,208
It was Mr Liu.

111
00:11:12,568 --> 00:11:13,528
Mr Liu, he...

112
00:11:13,688 --> 00:11:14,688
Mr Liu?

113
00:11:15,528 --> 00:11:16,328
You mean Liu Chang Qing?

114
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,128
What benefit did he give you

115
00:11:19,128 --> 00:11:20,888
for you to bring Tian Zhen along?

116
00:11:23,888 --> 00:11:24,768
Do you know

117
00:11:25,568 --> 00:11:27,088
that Liu Chang Qing

118
00:11:27,369 --> 00:11:29,128
has already left the mountain
with the ginseng

119
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:30,409
that my son risked his life to gather?

120
00:11:34,849 --> 00:11:35,727
Ling Lan,

121
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:36,829
calm down.

122
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:38,313
What's wrong?

123
00:11:38,768 --> 00:11:40,008
Did I say something wrong?

124
00:11:40,328 --> 00:11:41,528
It's all her fault!

125
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:45,128
My son is an obedient boy.

126
00:11:45,128 --> 00:11:46,888
Why would he try to harvest ginseng
without permission?

127
00:11:47,688 --> 00:11:48,849
He wouldn't have been bitten by a snake

128
00:11:48,849 --> 00:11:50,809
and ended up like this
if it weren't for her!

129
00:11:50,929 --> 00:11:51,875
Ling Lan.

130
00:11:53,328 --> 00:11:54,235
Sun Tou Tou.

131
00:11:56,448 --> 00:11:57,369
Sun Tou Tou!

132
00:12:01,448 --> 00:12:02,289
Leave immediately.

133
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:03,329
Ling Lan.

134
00:12:07,128 --> 00:12:08,328
If she doesn't leave,

135
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:09,169
I'll leave!

136
00:12:22,768 --> 00:12:23,633
Master,

137
00:12:24,169 --> 00:12:25,032
it wasn't me.

138
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:26,609
It was Liu Chang Qing.

139
00:12:26,609 --> 00:12:27,648
Liu Chang Qing said

140
00:12:27,648 --> 00:12:28,969
if we didn't harvest the ginseng,
we would...

141
00:12:28,969 --> 00:12:29,875
Shut up!

142
00:12:30,929 --> 00:12:31,929
Don't chase me away.

143
00:12:32,969 --> 00:12:33,768
Please don't chase me away!

144
00:12:33,888 --> 00:12:34,768
Please don't chase me away!

145
00:12:34,849 --> 00:12:36,008
Please don't chase me away!

146
00:12:36,328 --> 00:12:37,448
Please don't chase me away!

147
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:39,249
Please don't chase me away!

148
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:42,328
It wasn't me!

149
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:43,809
It was Liu Chang Qing!

150
00:12:46,169 --> 00:12:47,055
Tou Tou.

151
00:12:53,049 --> 00:12:53,954
Leave the mountain.

152
00:13:00,648 --> 00:13:01,610
Escort her down the mountain.

153
00:13:31,729 --> 00:13:32,719
Tou Tou,

154
00:13:33,049 --> 00:13:34,688
don't be too worried.

155
00:13:35,328 --> 00:13:36,729
Madam is just worried

156
00:13:36,729 --> 00:13:37,768
about Tian Zhen.

157
00:13:38,128 --> 00:13:39,208
She said that out of spite.

158
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:40,888
I'm sure she wasn't sincere
in chasing you away.

159
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:42,696
You should go back.

160
00:13:44,249 --> 00:13:45,849
Tou Tou, I'm serious.

161
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:47,208
I believe you too.

162
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:48,448
I'm sure you didn't do it on purpose.

163
00:13:52,128 --> 00:13:53,249
I'm serious too.

164
00:13:53,849 --> 00:13:55,169
You should head back.

165
00:13:55,929 --> 00:13:58,208
I can get down the mountain myself.

166
00:14:00,489 --> 00:14:02,008
You should check on Tian Zhen.

167
00:14:03,088 --> 00:14:04,169
Although they said he was fine,

168
00:14:04,169 --> 00:14:05,289
I didn't check on him myself.

169
00:14:05,289 --> 00:14:06,768
I'm still worried about him.

170
00:14:07,729 --> 00:14:08,929
Head back

171
00:14:09,369 --> 00:14:10,489
and tell him to call me.

172
00:14:12,489 --> 00:14:13,438
You hear me?

173
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:16,128
Will you be fine?

174
00:14:17,448 --> 00:14:18,409
Of course.

175
00:14:20,169 --> 00:14:21,128
It's not like I was bitten by a snake.

176
00:14:24,849 --> 00:14:25,888
I'll be fine.

177
00:14:25,888 --> 00:14:27,768
Head back and check on him.

178
00:14:27,888 --> 00:14:28,849
I'll be waiting

179
00:14:28,969 --> 00:14:30,729
for your news

180
00:14:30,729 --> 00:14:31,609
at the village down the mountain.

181
00:14:31,768 --> 00:14:32,672
Got it?

182
00:14:34,448 --> 00:14:35,409
Go now.

183
00:14:36,369 --> 00:14:37,336
Go ahead.

184
00:14:42,409 --> 00:14:44,249
Remember to tell him to call me.

185
00:14:44,528 --> 00:14:46,008
You have to be careful, okay?

186
00:14:52,729 --> 00:14:54,049
Tell the guys not to worry about me.

187
00:14:54,809 --> 00:14:55,758
Okay.

188
00:15:33,888 --> 00:15:35,128
This is an unexpected calamity.

189
00:15:36,409 --> 00:15:37,609
No, it's a man-made disaster.

190
00:15:38,489 --> 00:15:40,289
We don't know what happened for sure.

191
00:15:40,929 --> 00:15:42,169
We mustn't jump to conclusions.

192
00:15:49,849 --> 00:15:50,719
Tian Zhen.

193
00:15:51,554 --> 00:15:52,454
Tian Zhen?

194
00:15:52,568 --> 00:15:53,409
Are you awake?

195
00:15:54,729 --> 00:15:55,586
Mum.

196
00:15:55,768 --> 00:15:56,657
What's the matter?

197
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,568
I'm a little thirsty.

198
00:15:59,809 --> 00:16:00,888
Have some salt water.

199
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:03,409
I'm sure he's starving.

200
00:16:03,609 --> 00:16:04,648
I'll make him some food.

201
00:16:10,249 --> 00:16:11,489
Slow down.

202
00:16:12,169 --> 00:16:13,409
Take a small sip.

203
00:16:16,169 --> 00:16:16,977
Here.

204
00:16:22,289 --> 00:16:23,164
Mum.

205
00:16:25,169 --> 00:16:26,208
Where's the ginseng?

206
00:16:27,448 --> 00:16:28,888
You're still thinking about the ginseng?

207
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:30,049
Liu Chang Qing left the mountain

208
00:16:30,409 --> 00:16:31,729
together with it long ago.

209
00:16:32,688 --> 00:16:33,849
You're truly

210
00:16:34,609 --> 00:16:36,448
dumb.

211
00:16:36,609 --> 00:16:37,568
How could you do

212
00:16:37,568 --> 00:16:38,369
whatever people tell you to do?

213
00:16:39,169 --> 00:16:40,648
You're so silly.

214
00:16:41,328 --> 00:16:42,243
I...

215
00:16:42,809 --> 00:16:43,625
I...

216
00:16:44,809 --> 00:16:45,888
Slowly.

217
00:16:47,568 --> 00:16:48,648
I'm fine now.

218
00:16:49,929 --> 00:16:50,821
Don't...

219
00:16:51,289 --> 00:16:52,609
Don't worry about me.

220
00:16:53,809 --> 00:16:55,088
Don't worry about you?

221
00:16:56,289 --> 00:16:57,969
You almost died, you know?

222
00:16:59,049 --> 00:16:59,888
Mr Qiu said

223
00:17:00,249 --> 00:17:02,489
you were bitten by
a Vipera russelli siamensis.

224
00:17:05,568 --> 00:17:06,409
My goodness.

225
00:17:13,888 --> 00:17:14,813
Tou Tou.

226
00:17:16,774 --> 00:17:17,608
Tou Tou.

227
00:17:17,648 --> 00:17:18,528
Stop calling for her.

228
00:17:19,088 --> 00:17:20,008
I've already chased her away.

229
00:17:22,049 --> 00:17:22,969
You...

230
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,489
You chased her away?

231
00:17:26,609 --> 00:17:27,493
Mum,

232
00:17:30,128 --> 00:17:31,489
I was the one who promised Mr Liu

233
00:17:32,888 --> 00:17:34,929
that I would harvest the ginseng.

234
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,169
Even now, you're still

235
00:17:37,328 --> 00:17:39,049
trying to defend her?

236
00:17:40,568 --> 00:17:41,547
This time,

237
00:17:42,609 --> 00:17:43,633
it...

238
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,328
It wasn't Tou Tou's fault.

239
00:17:45,688 --> 00:17:46,648
She insisted on

240
00:17:47,648 --> 00:17:48,888
following Dad's instructions.

241
00:17:50,049 --> 00:17:50,929
It was my fault.

242
00:17:53,088 --> 00:17:55,088
I wanted to retain the apprentice class.

243
00:17:57,688 --> 00:17:58,625
The apprentice class

244
00:17:59,289 --> 00:18:01,008
is Dad's life's work after all.

245
00:18:03,289 --> 00:18:05,249
That's why I promised Mr Liu to do so.

246
00:18:07,409 --> 00:18:08,352
Tou Tou

247
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:10,249
joined me

248
00:18:10,249 --> 00:18:11,809
in order to help me out.

249
00:18:12,489 --> 00:18:13,454
Mum.

250
00:18:15,568 --> 00:18:16,469
You...

251
00:18:16,648 --> 00:18:18,249
You maligned Tou Tou.

252
00:18:20,729 --> 00:18:21,648
Kid,

253
00:18:23,688 --> 00:18:24,849
you risked your life

254
00:18:25,528 --> 00:18:26,609
just to fulfil his request?

255
00:18:29,929 --> 00:18:30,797
Mum.

256
00:18:32,888 --> 00:18:33,805
You...

257
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:38,969
This time, you mustn't
chase Tou Tou away.

258
00:18:39,489 --> 00:18:40,369
This accident

259
00:18:41,649 --> 00:18:43,009
was my responsibility.

260
00:18:50,529 --> 00:18:51,407
Ling Lan,

261
00:18:55,328 --> 00:18:57,408
I heard what Tian Zhen said just now.

262
00:18:58,849 --> 00:19:00,009
Keeping one's emotions in check

263
00:19:00,808 --> 00:19:02,688
is something we have
to practice forever.

264
00:19:03,249 --> 00:19:04,328
You lost control of your emotions today.

265
00:19:08,928 --> 00:19:09,899
Tou Tou.

266
00:19:11,408 --> 00:19:12,889
Where is she right now?

267
00:19:14,649 --> 00:19:15,568
Tou Tou isn't here.

268
00:19:16,249 --> 00:19:17,568
Your mother chased her away.

269
00:19:23,889 --> 00:19:25,009
What are you doing?

270
00:19:25,769 --> 00:19:26,688
I'm going to look for her.

271
00:19:27,009 --> 00:19:28,889
How could you look for her
in this state?

272
00:19:29,408 --> 00:19:30,227
You...

273
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:31,369
You should rest first.

274
00:19:31,369 --> 00:19:32,321
Mum.

275
00:19:32,808 --> 00:19:34,448
Tou Tou is bad at directions.

276
00:19:34,649 --> 00:19:35,849
She got lost once

277
00:19:35,849 --> 00:19:37,208
when she entered the mountains.

278
00:19:38,688 --> 00:19:40,249
I'm worried about her.

279
00:19:44,729 --> 00:19:46,288
Calm down.

280
00:19:49,489 --> 00:19:50,529
We can call her.

281
00:20:31,529 --> 00:20:32,729
Hao Hao!

282
00:20:32,808 --> 00:20:34,408
Is anyone there? Help!

283
00:20:34,529 --> 00:20:35,408
Help!

284
00:20:35,688 --> 00:20:36,586
Hao Hao!

285
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:37,609
Help!

286
00:20:37,857 --> 00:20:38,883
Hao Hao!

287
00:20:39,369 --> 00:20:40,313
Hao Hao!

288
00:20:40,849 --> 00:20:42,249
Miss, please save my son!

289
00:20:42,249 --> 00:20:43,489
Hurry up!

290
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:45,129
He fell unconscious!

291
00:20:45,288 --> 00:20:46,204
Hurry!

292
00:20:47,369 --> 00:20:48,208
Does he have epilepsy?

293
00:20:48,369 --> 00:20:49,208
I don't know!

294
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:50,729
He has never been like this before!

295
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:52,808
He only became like this
when I sent him to school today!

296
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:56,088
What are you doing?

297
00:20:56,568 --> 00:20:57,568
I'm a doctor. Listen to me.

298
00:20:57,568 --> 00:20:58,469
Okay.

299
00:20:59,808 --> 00:21:00,688
Son?

300
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:10,438
Her phone is switched off.

301
00:21:14,489 --> 00:21:15,454
Mum.

302
00:21:16,969 --> 00:21:18,448
How long has it been since
Tou Tou left the place?

303
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:32,288
Mr Ren, are you looking for me?

304
00:21:33,928 --> 00:21:35,009
What are you doing here?

305
00:21:35,808 --> 00:21:36,729
Didn't I instruct you

306
00:21:36,729 --> 00:21:37,729
to escort Tou Tou down the mountain?

307
00:21:37,928 --> 00:21:39,288
She didn't want me to escort her.

308
00:21:39,288 --> 00:21:41,249
She told me to come back
and check on Tian Zhen.

309
00:21:42,088 --> 00:21:43,000
But...

310
00:21:43,529 --> 00:21:44,568
But how could you let her

311
00:21:45,408 --> 00:21:46,448
leave by herself?

312
00:21:47,369 --> 00:21:48,808
There's only one road
to get down the mountain.

313
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:50,009
She should be fine.

314
00:21:50,168 --> 00:21:52,688
Besides, she said she would wait for us
in the village below the mountain.

315
00:21:52,808 --> 00:21:53,704
What's the matter?

316
00:21:58,889 --> 00:21:59,735
Tou Tou.

317
00:22:01,489 --> 00:22:03,048
Tou Tou switched off her phone.

318
00:22:04,849 --> 00:22:06,369
We couldn't reach her.

319
00:22:08,889 --> 00:22:10,568
She spent the entire night
in the yard last night.

320
00:22:10,928 --> 00:22:13,009
I think her phone ran out of battery.

321
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:16,657
Mum,

322
00:22:17,889 --> 00:22:18,808
help me up.

323
00:22:23,448 --> 00:22:24,282
Miss, how is he?

324
00:22:27,168 --> 00:22:28,009
His pulse is stable now.

325
00:22:28,009 --> 00:22:29,129
His life is out of danger at the moment.

326
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:31,328
This is great.

327
00:22:31,328 --> 00:22:32,408
-Thank you, Miss.
-You should

328
00:22:32,408 --> 00:22:34,088
still send him to the hospital
for a check-up.

329
00:22:34,288 --> 00:22:35,568
Epilepsy needs to be treated.

330
00:22:35,568 --> 00:22:36,808
He won't be this lucky next time.

331
00:22:37,424 --> 00:22:38,258
You're right.

332
00:22:38,369 --> 00:22:39,928
There's transport that can send us
to the town hospital in our village.

333
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:41,489
What are you waiting for then?

334
00:22:41,489 --> 00:22:42,313
Hurry and go.

335
00:22:42,546 --> 00:22:43,401
You're right.

336
00:22:43,489 --> 00:22:44,328
-Come on.
-Son.

337
00:22:44,688 --> 00:22:45,849
-Okay.
-Up.

338
00:22:46,048 --> 00:22:47,168
Hold the rod for him.

339
00:22:47,168 --> 00:22:48,009
That's his treasure.

340
00:22:48,489 --> 00:22:49,729
Thank you.

341
00:22:50,408 --> 00:22:51,568
My child,

342
00:22:52,649 --> 00:22:53,649
hang in there.

343
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,224
Miss!

344
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:57,088
-Hurry up!
-Coming!

345
00:22:57,208 --> 00:22:58,009
Hang in there!

346
00:23:00,048 --> 00:23:01,009
Mr Ren, Mr Qiu,

347
00:23:01,249 --> 00:23:02,969
we went to the village
to inquire about her.

348
00:23:03,088 --> 00:23:04,568
There was no one in the reception house.

349
00:23:04,688 --> 00:23:06,489
-Yeah.
-There was no one in the hotel too.

350
00:23:06,609 --> 00:23:07,729
We asked the ticket office too.

351
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,408
They said they didn't see her.

352
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,407
Are you sure?

353
00:23:10,688 --> 00:23:11,547
Yes.

354
00:23:11,849 --> 00:23:12,649
The vehicle that was heading to the city

355
00:23:12,649 --> 00:23:13,769
departed this morning.

356
00:23:14,249 --> 00:23:15,088
They didn't see her.

357
00:23:15,208 --> 00:23:16,609
Where can she be then?

358
00:23:16,688 --> 00:23:18,769
It'll be dusk soon.

359
00:23:19,529 --> 00:23:21,088
And, she's a girl

360
00:23:21,168 --> 00:23:22,688
trapped within the forest.

361
00:23:22,849 --> 00:23:24,649
What if something happens to her?

362
00:23:24,649 --> 00:23:26,729
It's all my fault.

363
00:23:26,729 --> 00:23:28,408
Ling Lan, calm down.

364
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:30,180
Mr Qiu,

365
00:23:30,769 --> 00:23:31,657
you and Ling Lan

366
00:23:32,088 --> 00:23:32,928
can bring the students

367
00:23:33,129 --> 00:23:34,048
and catch the next ride.

368
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,440
You guys should head back.

369
00:23:35,448 --> 00:23:37,448
No! I'm going to look for Tou Tou.

370
00:23:37,568 --> 00:23:38,469
Don't worry about her.

371
00:23:38,649 --> 00:23:40,048
Alright. You guys.

372
00:23:40,369 --> 00:23:41,250
Li Quan.

373
00:23:41,288 --> 00:23:42,088
Stay here with me.

374
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:42,875
We'll wait for Tou Tou.

375
00:23:43,369 --> 00:23:44,369
Don't worry.

376
00:23:45,808 --> 00:23:46,625
Dad,

377
00:23:46,928 --> 00:23:47,829
Mum,

378
00:23:48,208 --> 00:23:49,282
I'll stay here too.

379
00:23:53,048 --> 00:23:53,889
Tian Zhen will stay.

380
00:23:54,328 --> 00:23:55,168
Don't worry.

381
00:23:55,969 --> 00:23:56,860
I'm here.

382
00:23:57,348 --> 00:23:58,375
Li Quan,

383
00:23:58,568 --> 00:23:59,568
look after Madam.

384
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:00,680
Yes, Master.

385
00:24:01,529 --> 00:24:03,649
You guys must apologise to Tou Tou

386
00:24:04,168 --> 00:24:05,609
on my behalf if you see her.

387
00:24:05,609 --> 00:24:06,568
Alright.

388
00:24:07,408 --> 00:24:08,288
Don't catch the night ride.

389
00:24:08,609 --> 00:24:10,208
You guys must reach home by nightfall.

390
00:24:11,288 --> 00:24:13,369
Take care of yourself.

391
00:24:14,649 --> 00:24:15,711
Just go.

392
00:24:34,328 --> 00:24:35,769
-Miss.
-Wait, mister.

393
00:24:35,769 --> 00:24:36,928
-Miss.
-This is nothing.

394
00:24:36,928 --> 00:24:37,969
-Miss, wait!
-Don't do this.

395
00:24:37,969 --> 00:24:38,849
Miss!

396
00:24:39,609 --> 00:24:41,288
I already told you.
Don't be so courteous.

397
00:24:41,288 --> 00:24:43,288
Miss, I haven't got to thank you yet.

398
00:24:43,568 --> 00:24:44,485
I'm lucky

399
00:24:44,729 --> 00:24:46,168
to encounter you today.

400
00:24:46,408 --> 00:24:47,688
Coincidentally, you're a doctor.

401
00:24:48,129 --> 00:24:49,529
I'm so thankful to you.

402
00:24:49,769 --> 00:24:51,009
You saved his life.

403
00:24:52,088 --> 00:24:53,009
It's fine.

404
00:24:53,009 --> 00:24:54,328
As long as the kid is safe.

405
00:24:54,328 --> 00:24:55,729
Besides,

406
00:24:55,849 --> 00:24:57,808
doctors are meant to save lives.

407
00:24:57,969 --> 00:24:59,088
Although that's the case,

408
00:24:59,328 --> 00:25:01,328
and this may be nothing to you,

409
00:25:01,529 --> 00:25:02,568
you're still

410
00:25:02,928 --> 00:25:04,529
my son's benefactor.

411
00:25:05,088 --> 00:25:07,208
I don't know how

412
00:25:07,208 --> 00:25:08,649
I can repay you.

413
00:25:08,649 --> 00:25:10,088
Let me kowtow to you.

414
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:11,928
Mister!

415
00:25:11,928 --> 00:25:13,288
This won't do.

416
00:25:13,448 --> 00:25:14,313
Listen.

417
00:25:14,408 --> 00:25:15,808
It's fine as long as the kid is safe.

418
00:25:15,808 --> 00:25:16,750
You don't need to...

419
00:25:18,009 --> 00:25:18,860
What's wrong?

420
00:25:19,769 --> 00:25:22,048
If you truly wish to repay me,

421
00:25:23,649 --> 00:25:24,928
can you give that to me?

422
00:25:26,529 --> 00:25:27,454
You mean this?

423
00:25:27,928 --> 00:25:29,249
This is inappropriate. It's cheap.

424
00:25:29,288 --> 00:25:30,196
-My son just picked it up.
-It's not.

425
00:25:30,448 --> 00:25:32,249
To me, this is more valuable than money.

426
00:25:32,568 --> 00:25:33,729
-Really?
-Yeah.

427
00:25:34,249 --> 00:25:35,808
Alright then.

428
00:25:36,408 --> 00:25:37,448
Sorry about this.

429
00:25:39,208 --> 00:25:40,408
Miss,

430
00:25:40,408 --> 00:25:41,849
why don't you join us for dinner?

431
00:25:41,849 --> 00:25:42,696
No, thanks.

432
00:25:42,928 --> 00:25:44,249
Go and check on your child.

433
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:46,088
Mister, you should check on your child.

434
00:25:47,448 --> 00:25:48,438
Miss,

435
00:25:49,609 --> 00:25:51,088
you're a kind Samaritan.

436
00:25:52,969 --> 00:25:53,946
Thank you.

437
00:25:54,448 --> 00:25:55,422
Thank you.

438
00:25:58,129 --> 00:25:58,985
Thank you.

439
00:26:00,688 --> 00:26:01,672
Thank you.

440
00:26:01,849 --> 00:26:02,821
Thank you.

441
00:26:05,048 --> 00:26:05,868
Thank you!

442
00:26:29,729 --> 00:26:31,489
It's all thanks to you.

443
00:26:31,649 --> 00:26:32,489
My son was lucky.

444
00:26:32,808 --> 00:26:33,928
I'm lucky to encounter you today.

445
00:26:34,129 --> 00:26:35,369
Coincidentally, you're a doctor.

446
00:26:35,849 --> 00:26:37,208
I'm so thankful to you.

447
00:26:37,448 --> 00:26:38,769
You saved his life.

448
00:27:15,969 --> 00:27:16,868
Hello?

449
00:27:17,048 --> 00:27:18,889
Sun Tou Tou, do you think it's fun
to vanish like that?

450
00:27:20,969 --> 00:27:21,849
Where are you right now?

451
00:27:22,928 --> 00:27:24,889
Wait. Are you okay now?

452
00:27:24,889 --> 00:27:25,805
You...

453
00:27:27,009 --> 00:27:28,729
I'm at the town's health centre now.

454
00:27:32,529 --> 00:27:33,391
Hello?

455
00:27:48,649 --> 00:27:49,547
Tou Tou!

456
00:27:50,129 --> 00:27:51,086
Tou Tou!

457
00:27:52,328 --> 00:27:53,133
Tou Tou!

458
00:27:56,448 --> 00:27:57,568
Was it fun to disappear on us like that?

459
00:27:57,649 --> 00:27:58,889
-I didn't!
-Why did you run away?

460
00:27:58,889 --> 00:28:00,729
-We were worried.
-I didn't disappear.

461
00:28:00,729 --> 00:28:02,729
Do you know how many people
are worried about you?

462
00:28:03,529 --> 00:28:04,477
Are you okay now?

463
00:28:05,568 --> 00:28:06,485
I'm fine now.

464
00:28:06,969 --> 00:28:08,328
My mother is worried about you.

465
00:28:15,088 --> 00:28:16,009
What are you doing here?

466
00:28:19,529 --> 00:28:20,369
Did you fall and get hurt?

467
00:28:22,969 --> 00:28:23,808
If so, what are you doing here?

468
00:28:29,649 --> 00:28:30,688
Tell me what happened.
I'll punish you later.

469
00:28:34,489 --> 00:28:36,168
I met a kid in the middle of the road.

470
00:28:37,609 --> 00:28:38,489
I saved him

471
00:28:39,328 --> 00:28:40,889
and sent him to the health centre.

472
00:28:42,705 --> 00:28:43,555
His father...

473
00:28:45,448 --> 00:28:46,849
His father called me a doctor.

474
00:28:53,408 --> 00:28:54,408
That was my first time

475
00:28:54,408 --> 00:28:55,568
hearing someone refer to me as a doctor.

476
00:28:58,288 --> 00:28:59,196
Master,

477
00:29:00,408 --> 00:29:01,568
I think

478
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:02,928
I've found my calling.

479
00:29:06,609 --> 00:29:08,168
I wish to be a doctor.

480
00:29:09,408 --> 00:29:10,849
I truly wish

481
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:12,688
to be an excellent doctor.

482
00:29:15,729 --> 00:29:16,610
Master,

483
00:29:17,408 --> 00:29:19,009
I've decided that you're my master.

484
00:29:19,928 --> 00:29:21,249
You'll be my master

485
00:29:21,568 --> 00:29:22,969
for the rest of my life.

486
00:29:23,529 --> 00:29:24,928
So, please teach me.

487
00:29:25,609 --> 00:29:26,969
I'll definitely study hard under you

488
00:29:27,208 --> 00:29:28,088
and strive to improve myself.

489
00:29:30,889 --> 00:29:31,808
Once I master the required skills,

490
00:29:32,889 --> 00:29:34,568
I'll definitely spread the name
of our sect.

491
00:29:35,208 --> 00:29:36,288
Please believe me.

492
00:29:38,048 --> 00:29:39,448
I will accomplish my mission

493
00:29:39,769 --> 00:29:41,048
and not let our sect down.

494
00:29:57,609 --> 00:29:59,168
I don't expect that much from you.

495
00:30:01,688 --> 00:30:02,849
And, I don't need you

496
00:30:03,529 --> 00:30:05,489
to bring honour to our ancestors.

497
00:30:06,729 --> 00:30:08,609
I only hope

498
00:30:10,129 --> 00:30:12,369
that you won't tell anyone my name

499
00:30:12,808 --> 00:30:14,328
when you get into trouble in the future.

500
00:30:22,568 --> 00:30:23,568
Is that all?

501
00:30:25,288 --> 00:30:26,172
Yes.

502
00:30:29,288 --> 00:30:30,204
Alright.

503
00:30:32,529 --> 00:30:33,568
Words alone are no proof.

504
00:30:34,088 --> 00:30:35,079
We need to write it down.

505
00:30:36,328 --> 00:30:37,168
You don't trust me?

506
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:38,609
That's not it.

507
00:30:39,889 --> 00:30:41,489
Roubecca said this before.

508
00:30:41,928 --> 00:30:43,129
If students of the apprentice class
wish to treat people,

509
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:44,928
they have to sign a contract.

510
00:30:45,328 --> 00:30:47,408
After the required amount
of training time,

511
00:30:47,889 --> 00:30:49,889
we need to take the apprentice exam
and pass it.

512
00:30:50,129 --> 00:30:51,649
Only then can we practice medicine.

513
00:30:52,088 --> 00:30:53,168
Before this,

514
00:30:53,369 --> 00:30:54,288
I wasn't paying attention at all.

515
00:30:54,369 --> 00:30:55,529
Now, I wish to study hard.

516
00:30:55,529 --> 00:30:56,769
We should still write it down.

517
00:30:56,769 --> 00:30:58,088
Only then, I can have peace of mind.

518
00:31:01,808 --> 00:31:02,928
We wrote it down long ago.

519
00:31:03,609 --> 00:31:05,208
We already signed the note

520
00:31:05,208 --> 00:31:06,328
during our first encounter.

521
00:31:08,048 --> 00:31:08,954
When?

522
00:31:09,168 --> 00:31:10,048
You forgot.

523
00:31:11,048 --> 00:31:11,961
Is that so?

524
00:31:15,288 --> 00:31:16,129
Read your ID number for me.

525
00:31:16,889 --> 00:31:18,568
3-1-1-1

526
00:31:18,729 --> 00:31:21,129
9-9-7-0-8

527
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:23,529
0-9-4-1-2-0.

528
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:27,288
You're an experienced
TCM practitioner indeed.

529
00:31:27,529 --> 00:31:28,489
I can't read

530
00:31:28,769 --> 00:31:29,928
a single word you wrote.

531
00:31:30,609 --> 00:31:31,594
Sign it.

532
00:31:34,328 --> 00:31:35,168
Where?

533
00:31:35,529 --> 00:31:36,399
Here.

534
00:31:55,369 --> 00:31:56,408
Keep this copy.

535
00:31:56,688 --> 00:31:57,609
Keep it well.

536
00:31:57,609 --> 00:31:58,408
It'll be of use in the future.

537
00:31:58,769 --> 00:31:59,727
Really?

538
00:32:00,009 --> 00:32:01,928
Can I sue you with this
if you don't pay up?

539
00:32:04,969 --> 00:32:06,609
That's not it.

540
00:32:06,609 --> 00:32:08,048
That was not an official document.

541
00:32:08,369 --> 00:32:09,808
It wasn't a formal one.

542
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:11,609
You have to at least

543
00:32:12,009 --> 00:32:14,328
give me a printed version.

544
00:32:14,928 --> 00:32:16,288
That's exuberant.

545
00:32:17,048 --> 00:32:18,529
Alright, let's go back.

546
00:32:18,928 --> 00:32:19,808
Master, wait.

547
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:23,489
Please keep this.

548
00:32:24,048 --> 00:32:25,208
Why are you giving me a broken rod?

549
00:32:25,208 --> 00:32:26,168
It's not.

550
00:32:26,808 --> 00:32:27,969
This is the consultation fee

551
00:32:27,969 --> 00:32:28,928
I received from my first patient.

552
00:32:29,849 --> 00:32:30,849
People say

553
00:32:31,448 --> 00:32:32,808
that we must hand
our first consultation fee

554
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:35,129
to our masters, right?

555
00:32:45,168 --> 00:32:46,047
Okay.

556
00:32:46,568 --> 00:32:47,369
I'll keep it for now.

557
00:32:49,489 --> 00:32:50,391
This is good.

558
00:32:51,288 --> 00:32:52,529
I can use it to beat you up

559
00:32:52,529 --> 00:32:53,969
when you commit mistakes in the future.

560
00:32:55,208 --> 00:32:56,219
Alright.

561
00:32:57,928 --> 00:32:58,899
Master,

562
00:33:00,288 --> 00:33:01,204
this rod

563
00:33:02,249 --> 00:33:03,448
is at least

564
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:04,448
worth ten yuan, right?

565
00:33:04,969 --> 00:33:05,860
This broken rod

566
00:33:06,369 --> 00:33:07,408
is worth ten yuan?

567
00:33:07,609 --> 00:33:08,408
-You can keep it.
-Wait.

568
00:33:08,408 --> 00:33:09,808
-No, thanks.
-It's not like I want money from you.

569
00:33:09,808 --> 00:33:11,009
Why are you so stingy?

570
00:33:11,009 --> 00:33:12,448
Wait. Just hold it.

571
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,360
We can talk this over.

572
00:33:14,328 --> 00:33:15,288
The money box.

573
00:33:15,688 --> 00:33:17,969
You should put ten yuan
into the money box.

574
00:33:18,568 --> 00:33:19,969
I saved someone,

575
00:33:20,489 --> 00:33:21,375
right?

576
00:33:23,609 --> 00:33:24,448
Come, I'll carry it for you.

577
00:33:28,729 --> 00:33:29,688
Master, is this okay?

578
00:33:31,448 --> 00:33:32,336
Put ten yuan for me.

579
00:33:32,808 --> 00:33:33,769
Is it comfortable?

580
00:33:34,288 --> 00:33:35,188
How's the strength?

581
00:33:36,088 --> 00:33:37,448
Tian Zhen, take my bag!

582
00:33:53,208 --> 00:33:54,328
What's going on?

583
00:33:54,529 --> 00:33:56,288
What's wrong with Liu Chang Qing?

584
00:33:56,288 --> 00:33:57,769
-What's going on?
-I don't know.

585
00:33:58,168 --> 00:33:59,448
Hasn't Mr Liu dealt with the issue yet?

586
00:33:59,928 --> 00:34:01,729
That's impossible.
He already took the ginseng.

587
00:34:01,849 --> 00:34:03,048
Put that down!

588
00:34:03,048 --> 00:34:04,489
We bought the beds with our money.

589
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:05,489
-You...
-We're leaving them here.

590
00:34:05,489 --> 00:34:06,448
Hurry and move them away.

591
00:34:07,889 --> 00:34:08,891
What?

592
00:34:10,328 --> 00:34:11,448
Everyone, come and see.

593
00:34:11,448 --> 00:34:12,849
They're already starting
to clear the dorm.

594
00:34:12,849 --> 00:34:14,448
How could they do so?
Are they seizing our place?

595
00:34:16,849 --> 00:34:18,649
Didn't Liu Chang Qing tell you anything?

596
00:34:18,769 --> 00:34:20,088
Master, call him.

597
00:34:20,369 --> 00:34:21,928
Call him right now.

598
00:34:23,649 --> 00:34:24,849
Sorry about this.

599
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:26,609
Sorry about this.

600
00:34:27,529 --> 00:34:28,729
Professor Ren, Ms Song.

601
00:34:28,852 --> 00:34:30,448
I've let all of you down.

602
00:34:30,729 --> 00:34:31,664
Liu,

603
00:34:32,208 --> 00:34:33,808
did you not manage to pay your debt?

604
00:34:33,808 --> 00:34:34,889
Or have you

605
00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:36,688
mortgaged the entire place?

606
00:34:36,849 --> 00:34:37,657
Lu Chang Qing,

607
00:34:37,808 --> 00:34:39,463
where's the ginseng?

608
00:34:39,889 --> 00:34:41,408
Have you delivered it to him?

609
00:34:44,609 --> 00:34:45,969
Speak up!

610
00:34:46,328 --> 00:34:48,288
Tian Zhen risked his life
to get it for you!

611
00:34:48,288 --> 00:34:49,889
What do you mean by keeping quiet?

612
00:34:53,009 --> 00:34:54,088
That ginseng of yours,

613
00:34:56,168 --> 00:34:57,408
I can't return it to you right now.

614
00:34:57,568 --> 00:34:58,969
-I'll kill you!
-Tou Tou!

615
00:34:59,048 --> 00:35:00,088
-Tou Tou!
-I'll kill you!

616
00:35:00,249 --> 00:35:01,249
-I'll kill you!
-Tou Tou!

617
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:13,480
(One day ago)

618
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:15,048
Mr Liu, over here, please.

619
00:35:16,088 --> 00:35:17,249
Mr Liang.

620
00:35:17,889 --> 00:35:18,889
Mr Liang.

621
00:35:20,168 --> 00:35:21,129
Mr Liang.

622
00:35:21,489 --> 00:35:22,808
I went to the golf club to look for you.

623
00:35:22,808 --> 00:35:23,808
They said you were here.

624
00:35:25,649 --> 00:35:26,889
I play golf on Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday.

625
00:35:26,889 --> 00:35:27,849
I swim on Tuesday,
Thursday, and Saturday.

626
00:35:28,808 --> 00:35:29,889
You're a healthy person indeed.

627
00:35:30,048 --> 00:35:30,969
Here, have a seat.

628
00:35:30,969 --> 00:35:31,852
No, thanks.

629
00:35:32,557 --> 00:35:33,515
Have some water.

630
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,529
It's okay.

631
00:35:34,769 --> 00:35:36,568
Your water is too sacred
for me to drink.

632
00:35:39,529 --> 00:35:40,808
Don't misunderstand me.

633
00:35:40,808 --> 00:35:42,609
I'm not saying that I mind
drinking with your cup.

634
00:35:42,609 --> 00:35:44,969
You're a saint.

635
00:35:44,969 --> 00:35:46,489
This isn't water.

636
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:47,928
This is gold.

637
00:35:48,329 --> 00:35:49,489
It's just normal drinking water.

638
00:35:50,249 --> 00:35:51,089
It's not expensive.

639
00:35:51,848 --> 00:35:52,735
Do you need anything?

640
00:35:54,009 --> 00:35:54,914
You see,

641
00:35:55,809 --> 00:35:56,696
I brought a treasure here.

642
00:35:56,888 --> 00:35:57,797
It's a 100-year-old wild ginseng

643
00:35:58,077 --> 00:35:58,903
that I newly harvested

644
00:35:58,928 --> 00:36:00,969
from Changbai Mountain.

645
00:36:02,969 --> 00:36:04,608
I guarantee it's genuine.

646
00:36:05,448 --> 00:36:07,408
Professor Ren had his eyes on it
since ten years ago.

647
00:36:07,648 --> 00:36:10,009
Everyone was protecting it.

648
00:36:10,769 --> 00:36:12,089
I got myself in trouble

649
00:36:12,089 --> 00:36:13,009
when I harvested it.

650
00:36:13,368 --> 00:36:14,809
It was dangerous.

651
00:36:14,928 --> 00:36:15,848
I killed

652
00:36:15,848 --> 00:36:17,128
the venomous snake

653
00:36:17,448 --> 00:36:18,969
with one blow during the crucial moment.

654
00:36:18,969 --> 00:36:19,922
Without me,

655
00:36:20,208 --> 00:36:21,368
Professor Ren's son

656
00:36:22,009 --> 00:36:22,888
would be dead by now.

657
00:36:25,769 --> 00:36:27,608
So, you saved Professor Ren's son.

658
00:36:28,368 --> 00:36:31,049
It's no wonder Professor Ren
gave this treasure to you.

659
00:36:31,368 --> 00:36:32,888
Not to me, to you.

660
00:36:33,128 --> 00:36:33,969
Professor Ren said

661
00:36:35,128 --> 00:36:35,969
this was for you.

662
00:36:36,208 --> 00:36:37,009
Our TCM industrial park

663
00:36:37,648 --> 00:36:39,329
can only survive

664
00:36:39,329 --> 00:36:40,408
with your help.

665
00:36:42,688 --> 00:36:43,594
Please take a look.

666
00:36:44,249 --> 00:36:45,208
You have no idea.

667
00:36:45,208 --> 00:36:46,368
Searching for this ginseng

668
00:36:46,368 --> 00:36:48,928
was harder than mining for gold.

669
00:36:49,489 --> 00:36:50,969
Throughout our journey,

670
00:36:51,289 --> 00:36:52,274
we have to follow

671
00:36:52,688 --> 00:36:54,608
the trees

672
00:36:55,408 --> 00:36:56,729
with markings on it.

673
00:37:02,089 --> 00:37:03,848
Mr Liu, you're too modest.

674
00:37:06,009 --> 00:37:08,128
You're daring indeed.

675
00:37:09,368 --> 00:37:11,448
I'm sure the issue with
the TCM industrial park

676
00:37:11,969 --> 00:37:13,809
will be resolved successfully.

677
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,200
Thank you.

678
00:37:15,208 --> 00:37:16,688
So, according to what you said,

679
00:37:17,009 --> 00:37:19,368
Professor Ren's son risked his life
to harvest this for me?

680
00:37:19,368 --> 00:37:21,289
-That's right.
-I don't deserve it.

681
00:37:25,208 --> 00:37:26,329
Wait, Mr Liang.

682
00:37:26,969 --> 00:37:28,408
Mr Liang.

683
00:37:28,648 --> 00:37:29,688
Where can you find

684
00:37:29,688 --> 00:37:31,009
another 100-year-old wild ginseng?

685
00:37:31,848 --> 00:37:33,368
Tell me how old
you want the ginseng to be.

686
00:37:47,168 --> 00:37:48,489
Forget about acquiring investments.

687
00:37:49,529 --> 00:37:50,408
I dare to say

688
00:37:51,329 --> 00:37:53,529
that Mr Liang has blocked
my contact number.

689
00:37:54,168 --> 00:37:55,039
Let me ask you this then.

690
00:37:55,489 --> 00:37:56,360
Where's the ginseng?

691
00:37:57,168 --> 00:37:58,289
Where did it go?

692
00:37:58,289 --> 00:37:59,729
You'd better give me
a logical explanation.

693
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:01,888
That's the creepy part.

694
00:38:01,888 --> 00:38:03,529
I don't know where it went either.

695
00:38:03,529 --> 00:38:04,569
You don't know...

696
00:38:05,848 --> 00:38:06,774
Yes.

697
00:38:07,089 --> 00:38:08,769
I did carry the ginseng
down the mountain personally.

698
00:38:09,448 --> 00:38:10,249
When I reached home,

699
00:38:10,249 --> 00:38:11,408
I found an expensive

700
00:38:11,408 --> 00:38:12,809
and solid wooden box.

701
00:38:12,809 --> 00:38:13,688
I placed it inside.

702
00:38:13,809 --> 00:38:14,969
After that, I kept it in a safe.

703
00:38:14,969 --> 00:38:16,249
It was always there.

704
00:38:16,368 --> 00:38:17,448
But when I opened the box

705
00:38:17,448 --> 00:38:18,729
in front of Mr Liang,

706
00:38:19,888 --> 00:38:21,529
it was gone.

707
00:38:21,569 --> 00:38:22,375
You

708
00:38:22,489 --> 00:38:24,208
-must be lying!
-Did someone take it away?

709
00:38:24,888 --> 00:38:25,769
Who else knows about the ginseng

710
00:38:25,769 --> 00:38:27,208
besides you?

711
00:38:27,329 --> 00:38:28,569
No one else.

712
00:38:28,569 --> 00:38:29,648
Only my assistant and I knew about it.

713
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:32,089
However, I kept an eye on the box
during the entire meeting.

714
00:38:32,089 --> 00:38:34,009
Your words make no sense.

715
00:38:34,368 --> 00:38:36,729
How could no one else take it? Don't
tell me the ginseng ran away by itself?

716
00:38:38,569 --> 00:38:39,608
I did search for it

717
00:38:39,928 --> 00:38:41,009
online.

718
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:42,848
They say that ginseng has life.

719
00:38:43,809 --> 00:38:44,688
They can run away by themselves.

720
00:38:46,049 --> 00:38:46,944
Think about it.

721
00:38:46,969 --> 00:38:49,168
Many strange phenomena happened.

722
00:38:49,168 --> 00:38:50,489
Maybe it did run away.

723
00:38:50,489 --> 00:38:51,493
It ran away, huh?

724
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:52,657
Liu Chang Qing,

725
00:38:53,208 --> 00:38:54,848
you'd better stop your nonsensical tale.

726
00:38:55,009 --> 00:38:55,914
Today,

727
00:38:56,529 --> 00:38:57,688
it's either you return
the classroom to us,

728
00:38:58,009 --> 00:38:58,888
return the ginseng to us,

729
00:38:59,132 --> 00:39:00,024
or let me

730
00:39:00,089 --> 00:39:01,529
beat you up!

731
00:39:01,529 --> 00:39:02,329
Tou Tou!

732
00:39:02,329 --> 00:39:03,809
-Enough!
-I'll kill you!

733
00:39:03,809 --> 00:39:05,329
Tou Tou!

734
00:39:05,529 --> 00:39:07,448
Master! Don't let him escape!

735
00:39:07,489 --> 00:39:08,336
Tou Tou!

736
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,320
Tou Tou!

737
00:39:09,329 --> 00:39:10,769
He must be lying to us again!

738
00:39:12,648 --> 00:39:13,539
Listen to me.

739
00:39:13,969 --> 00:39:15,448
Let's trust him. He's not lying.

740
00:39:15,809 --> 00:39:16,729
But Master...

741
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:17,711
Think about it.

742
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:19,888
He'll incur more losses

743
00:39:20,729 --> 00:39:21,729
if the industrial park is closed off.

744
00:39:22,448 --> 00:39:23,569
What should we do then?

745
00:39:29,888 --> 00:39:30,836
Bone Zhu.

746
00:39:31,569 --> 00:39:33,928
Bone Zhu has a ginseng
that's several decades old.

747
00:39:33,928 --> 00:39:34,888
We can find him.

748
00:39:35,009 --> 00:39:35,852
Let's find him.

749
00:39:36,648 --> 00:39:37,555
It's too late.

750
00:39:38,009 --> 00:39:39,688
I just confirmed it over the phone.

751
00:39:39,888 --> 00:39:41,848
The bank has already initiated
the mortgage procedure.

752
00:39:42,168 --> 00:39:43,888
Even if someone
is willing to invest in it,

753
00:39:44,608 --> 00:39:45,569
it's too late.

754
00:40:06,769 --> 00:40:08,168
Will this happen for real this time?

755
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:10,168
I guess our class will be cancelled.

756
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:11,608
I resigned

757
00:40:11,608 --> 00:40:12,608
in order to study here.

758
00:40:12,769 --> 00:40:14,168
I never expected this to happen.

759
00:40:14,729 --> 00:40:15,848
Where should I go now?

760
00:40:18,489 --> 00:40:20,368
We can still study
in the medical centre, right?

761
00:40:20,529 --> 00:40:21,809
Don't be so down.

762
00:40:22,089 --> 00:40:23,208
Theory classes might work,

763
00:40:23,208 --> 00:40:24,608
but not practical classes.

764
00:40:24,888 --> 00:40:26,489
For example, the medical centre
is too small to accommodate

765
00:40:26,688 --> 00:40:27,529
the beds we need to use

766
00:40:27,529 --> 00:40:28,529
for Ms Dong's technique class.

767
00:40:28,888 --> 00:40:30,608
That isn't the main point here.

768
00:40:31,289 --> 00:40:32,329
The main point is our accommodation.

769
00:40:33,329 --> 00:40:35,529
Local students or those who own a house
will not be affected.

770
00:40:36,089 --> 00:40:37,529
But what should we do about
the students from other states?

771
00:40:37,809 --> 00:40:38,769
Don't tell me Mr Ren

772
00:40:39,089 --> 00:40:40,489
is going to let them stay in his house?

773
00:40:41,688 --> 00:40:42,648
Why don't you guys do what I'm doing?

774
00:40:43,128 --> 00:40:44,168
You can get a job on weekdays

775
00:40:44,368 --> 00:40:45,769
and attend the class and
consultation sessions

776
00:40:46,049 --> 00:40:47,071
during weekends.

777
00:40:47,529 --> 00:40:49,208
I burnt my boats just
to study medicine here.

778
00:40:49,688 --> 00:40:50,489
I didn't expect this

779
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:51,529
to happen.

780
00:40:51,769 --> 00:40:52,608
If I go back now,

781
00:40:53,128 --> 00:40:54,529
my wife will definitely mock me.

782
00:40:55,089 --> 00:40:56,168
She said it's tough enough

783
00:40:56,569 --> 00:40:58,648
to sustain your own life
if you study Chinese medicine.

784
00:40:59,729 --> 00:41:01,128
I never expected

785
00:41:01,128 --> 00:41:03,128
a famous figure like Professor Ren

786
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:04,969
to teach without any classrooms.

787
00:41:05,569 --> 00:41:07,969
Is there still hope for
Chinese medicine?

788
00:41:08,329 --> 00:41:09,249
If I work

789
00:41:09,249 --> 00:41:10,529
as a pharmaceutical representative,

790
00:41:10,529 --> 00:41:11,368
does this count

791
00:41:11,368 --> 00:41:12,249
as my medical qualification?

792
00:41:16,208 --> 00:41:18,888
What's with the despondent attitude?

793
00:41:19,888 --> 00:41:21,688
The class hasn't been cancelled yet.

794
00:41:21,928 --> 00:41:23,608
Besides, look at all the people we have.

795
00:41:23,809 --> 00:41:25,368
I'm sure we can figure something out.

796
00:41:29,848 --> 00:41:31,448
I'll ask my buddies when I get back.

797
00:41:31,769 --> 00:41:33,168
I saw many cheap places

798
00:41:33,168 --> 00:41:34,168
for rent before this.

799
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:35,329
I'll contact them when I head back.

800
00:41:35,608 --> 00:41:36,729
I'll tell you guys about it
once I confirm the details.

801
00:41:38,049 --> 00:41:38,875
Just wait for my news.

802
00:41:46,089 --> 00:41:46,953
Quan,

803
00:41:48,489 --> 00:41:49,529
you're not the unluckiest one here.

804
00:41:49,529 --> 00:41:50,368
At least you have a job

805
00:41:50,368 --> 00:41:51,168
and a place to stay.

806
00:41:51,329 --> 00:41:52,258
You should cherish them.

807
00:42:13,848 --> 00:42:15,648
Ming's Mum, listen.

808
00:42:15,648 --> 00:42:16,529
Le Le likes

809
00:42:16,648 --> 00:42:18,208
Ms Meng the most.

810
00:42:18,208 --> 00:42:19,848
-It's the same for us.
-Yeah, right?

811
00:42:19,848 --> 00:42:21,688
It's been some time since I saw you.

812
00:42:21,928 --> 00:42:22,797
Ms Meng

813
00:42:22,969 --> 00:42:23,828
is pregnant.

814
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,360
Really?

815
00:42:25,381 --> 00:42:27,489
The two-child or three-child policy
is the trend nowadays.

816
00:42:27,489 --> 00:42:28,848
Our government is providing
plenty of benefits to them.

817
00:42:29,408 --> 00:42:31,448
Ms Meng always wanted a child.

818
00:42:31,448 --> 00:42:32,769
Now, she's finally pregnant.

819
00:42:32,769 --> 00:42:34,009
-Yeah.
-It's great news.

820
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:34,891
What are you doing here?

821
00:42:37,368 --> 00:42:38,848
Tomorrow's the weekend.

822
00:42:38,848 --> 00:42:39,688
I was thinking

823
00:42:39,928 --> 00:42:41,569
that I would bring Le Le back with me

824
00:42:41,569 --> 00:42:42,489
and let him spend the weekend with us.

825
00:42:43,089 --> 00:42:44,608
Do you remember the wrong date?

826
00:42:45,249 --> 00:42:46,089
Le Le will only head

827
00:42:46,249 --> 00:42:47,848
to his father's place next week.

828
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,750
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

829
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,211
(are referenced from relevant
traditional Chinese medicine books)

830
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,797
