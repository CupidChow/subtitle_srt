1
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,920
8am.

2
00:00:26,139 --> 00:00:27,139
I'm punctual.

3
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:35,339
Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic.

4
00:00:36,019 --> 00:00:37,657
Questions of Organic
and Fundamental Nature?

5
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:38,697
From today onward,

6
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,019
you'll be a student of
the apprentice class.

7
00:00:41,699 --> 00:00:43,059
You'll learn TCM under me.

8
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,219
You'll do what I tell you to do.

9
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:56,780
I can't learn this.

10
00:00:57,059 --> 00:00:58,940
I'm not joking with you.

11
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,377
Since young, I'd get sleepy

12
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:02,460
whenever I read.

13
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:04,537
I'd get giddy.

14
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:05,620
I'm serious.

15
00:01:06,459 --> 00:01:07,720
We already signed a contract.

16
00:01:09,099 --> 00:01:10,300
Even so,

17
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,260
there's no way I can learn this.

18
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,800
Why don't I

19
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,060
do some chores

20
00:01:19,459 --> 00:01:20,859
or cook for you instead?

21
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,260
Don't cross your legs.

22
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:27,380
Put it down.

23
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:32,739
Your right waist hurts.

24
00:01:33,459 --> 00:01:34,859
Your hip bone hurts too, right?

25
00:01:36,099 --> 00:01:37,099
Yeah.

26
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:39,459
How did you know?

27
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:42,179
That's what you get for
crossing your legs.

28
00:01:42,539 --> 00:01:44,056
Not bad at all. You're pretty amazing.

29
00:01:44,139 --> 00:01:45,217
What kind of doctor are you?

30
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,297
The greatest kind.

31
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,217
How great are you?

32
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,218
My greatness exceeds your imagination.

33
00:01:48,301 --> 00:01:50,060
If so, how great are you?

34
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:53,099
Seems like you lack imagination.

35
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,754
Did you drink this morning?

36
00:01:55,099 --> 00:01:56,736
How many dishes did you consume
for you to get this drunk?

37
00:01:56,819 --> 00:01:58,620
I never eat anything when I drink.

38
00:02:00,739 --> 00:02:01,578
Before this,

39
00:02:01,661 --> 00:02:03,227
you said you were going to open a...

40
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,218
What was it again?

41
00:02:04,301 --> 00:02:05,380
An apprentice class.

42
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,157
You think you can fool me
after getting drunk?

43
00:02:08,379 --> 00:02:10,299
I never fool people.

44
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,576
Listen. I'll open an apprentice class.

45
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:14,019
Once I agree to do something,

46
00:02:16,019 --> 00:02:17,739
no one can stop me.

47
00:02:18,579 --> 00:02:20,579
Look at what you're saying.

48
00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:22,379
Try me if you dare.

49
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:30,939
Kid.

50
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:35,459
Shi Yan.

51
00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:37,737
The data for the animal experiment
is out.

52
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,342
Analyse it for me when you're free.

53
00:02:40,939 --> 00:02:41,737
It's only been one week,

54
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,296
yet you've gotten cooler, huh?

55
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:44,988
Are you trying to be a tough guy now?

56
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:45,936
Don't provoke me.

57
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:47,063
I'm in a bad mood today.

58
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,220
What's wrong with you?

59
00:02:51,179 --> 00:02:52,656
It's all because of
TCM practitioners like you.

60
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,936
We, doctors of Western medicine, had to
bear the blame because of your mistake.

61
00:02:56,019 --> 00:02:57,496
Don't be emotional.

62
00:02:57,579 --> 00:02:59,179
Emotion is the source of all evil.

63
00:03:00,939 --> 00:03:02,296
Did the parent of that child hit you?

64
00:03:02,379 --> 00:03:03,379
You don't say?

65
00:03:03,739 --> 00:03:05,856
They insisted on believing the words

66
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:06,736
of a TCM practitioner.

67
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:08,950
They're blaming it on us
when their child is sick.

68
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,376
You mustn't spout nonsense.

69
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:12,736
What proof do you have to prove
that it was our mistake?

70
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:13,819
Enough.

71
00:03:14,299 --> 00:03:15,496
I'm terrified of TCM practitioners now.

72
00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:17,420
-Nothing good will happen.
-Don't say that.

73
00:03:17,514 --> 00:03:18,994
Dr Peng.

74
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:20,819
Shi Yan,

75
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:24,140
I intend to ask you
to bring me out for more experiments.

76
00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:26,780
I don't understand you at all.

77
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:27,856
You're a prince

78
00:03:27,939 --> 00:03:28,817
that hails from a TCM family.

79
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,096
Why are you trying to learn
Western medicine in secret?

80
00:03:31,179 --> 00:03:32,456
Your father didn't agree to it
in the first place.

81
00:03:32,539 --> 00:03:34,379
Why are you taking the risk here?

82
00:03:34,539 --> 00:03:36,216
It's not like I'm learning it
for his sake.

83
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,576
Do I need to stop
just because he disagrees with it?

84
00:03:37,659 --> 00:03:38,576
What gives?

85
00:03:38,659 --> 00:03:39,659
Besides,

86
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,819
I want to prove to him

87
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,179
that TCM and Western medicine
can work in tandem.

88
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:45,900
Fine.

89
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:48,659
Mr Ren, you're ambitious indeed.

90
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,736
Mr Ren, you're both ambitious
and talented.

91
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:51,897
Ordinary men like us
can't afford to join your play.

92
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:52,980
I shall take my leave.

93
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,420
Why are you packing your things?

94
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,576
The hospital is afraid
I will get into more trouble.

95
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:02,225
They want to keep this a secret too.

96
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,459
That's why they told me
to rest for a few days.

97
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,280
You're resting?

98
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,780
Mr Ren,

99
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:16,859
I'll find you an excellent student.

100
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,179
Will people even join this?

101
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,313
(Ren Xin Zheng's TCM Apprentice Class)

102
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,697
There's something meaningful going on.

103
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:39,697
Do you want to hear me out?

104
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,780
What is it?

105
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,780
My father is holding
a TCM apprentice class.

106
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,459
Do you want to attend it?

107
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,577
Have you lost your mind?

108
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,417
Why should I learn TCM?

109
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,805
Do you think I haven't gotten
into enough trouble yet?

110
00:04:51,459 --> 00:04:52,496
Your so-called

111
00:04:52,579 --> 00:04:54,656
TCM practitioners don't even know
the molecular formulas.

112
00:04:54,739 --> 00:04:55,817
They don't even understand what
not to do when patients take medicine

113
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:56,936
or the adverse effects of the medicine.

114
00:04:57,019 --> 00:04:58,936
They don't know the interaction
between different medicine too.

115
00:04:59,019 --> 00:05:01,257
Even so, they could make money
out of their inferior skills.

116
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,859
That's literally a quack doctor.

117
00:05:03,459 --> 00:05:05,780
This time, you should
try to prove them wrong.

118
00:05:06,019 --> 00:05:07,417
See if you can find evidence

119
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,979
that TCM is just
a false study of science.

120
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,299
Are you even your father's son?

121
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,003
Do you hold a grudge against your father?

122
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,857
You want to land him in trouble.

123
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,496
But you want me to do it, huh?

124
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:31,537
Use your spear to pierce
my father's shield.

125
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:32,620
Let's see

126
00:05:33,579 --> 00:05:34,817
who's better.

127
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:35,900
What do you think?

128
00:05:36,459 --> 00:05:37,459
Shi Yan?

129
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,394
You better don't regret it.

130
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,668
(Peng Shi Yan)

131
00:05:45,943 --> 00:05:47,417
The court verdict is as such.

132
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,699
Attention.

133
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:53,979
According to Article 113, 159,

134
00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:55,739
and 161

135
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,620
of Contract Law of

136
00:05:57,829 --> 00:05:59,620
the People's Republic of China,

137
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,120
the court verdict is as such.

138
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,480
The defendant, Feng Zhuo,

139
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,388
should pay the plaintiff

140
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,419
a sum of 31.2 million yuan

141
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,500
and the overdue interest as well.

142
00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:10,936
If anyone is unsatisfied
with the final verdict,

143
00:06:11,019 --> 00:06:13,336
you may submit your complaint

144
00:06:13,419 --> 00:06:14,537
to the court 15 days within

145
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,739
the delivery of the verdict.

146
00:06:24,019 --> 00:06:25,137
The top lawyer of Jiangzhou

147
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,612
does live up to her name indeed.

148
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,500
Mr Kong, you flatter me.

149
00:06:30,459 --> 00:06:31,459
See you around.

150
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:33,699
I think it's better

151
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,655
if we never see each other again.

152
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,448
-Someone fainted!
-What's wrong?

153
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,060
Someone fainted!

154
00:06:47,179 --> 00:06:48,776
Mr Kong, are you okay? Mr Kong.

155
00:06:48,859 --> 00:06:49,859
Mr Kong!

156
00:06:51,859 --> 00:06:53,216
I'm afraid he had a heart attack.

157
00:06:53,299 --> 00:06:54,299
Call the ambulance!

158
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,900
-Call the ambulance!
-Call 120!

159
00:06:56,019 --> 00:06:57,019
Hurry and call 120!

160
00:07:03,739 --> 00:07:04,616
Let me put it this way.

161
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:05,656
If I do attend the apprentice class,

162
00:07:05,739 --> 00:07:07,179
your father can leave the class.

163
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,540
That's why I invited you.

164
00:07:09,739 --> 00:07:10,616
What were you guys talking about?

165
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:11,940
-That sounded fun.
-Quan.

166
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:13,459
Quan, what are you doing here?

167
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,540
I heard you two from far away.

168
00:07:16,579 --> 00:07:17,376
You travel everywhere, huh?

169
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:18,739
Speak for yourself.

170
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,376
I thought you were working at
the TCM affiliated hospital yesterday?

171
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:22,162
What are you doing
in a Western hospital today?

172
00:07:22,245 --> 00:07:23,056
Don't bring it up.

173
00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:25,620
Last night, they sent me
a rejection letter.

174
00:07:26,019 --> 00:07:27,656
I came to visit
the rehabilitation department.

175
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:28,936
They said they were hiring
acupuncturists.

176
00:07:29,019 --> 00:07:29,937
I came here to try my luck.

177
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,376
I told him long ago.

178
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:32,376
But you don't believe me.

179
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:33,656
Just go to my grandfather's
medical centre.

180
00:07:33,739 --> 00:07:34,776
I'm sure you'll get in
without any issues.

181
00:07:34,859 --> 00:07:35,859
That won't do.

182
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,220
My parents said

183
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,459
I have to get an established position.

184
00:07:39,739 --> 00:07:40,977
Only then, I can stay in Jiangzhou.

185
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,776
Once I have gained a firm foothold here,
I can bring my younger brother here.

186
00:07:42,859 --> 00:07:43,697
When I earn money,

187
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:44,538
I have to bring my parents

188
00:07:44,621 --> 00:07:46,699
and my relatives here.

189
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,968
Quan, it's tough on you indeed.

190
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:51,859
You got into college for the sake
of your whole village.

191
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,537
Here, take these fruits and milk.

192
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,477
Take them back.

193
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,376
They're my compensation.

194
00:07:56,459 --> 00:07:58,697
Yeah. Dr Peng won them after a battle.

195
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,137
Why are you still standing there?

196
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,137
It's my compensation.

197
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,220
Just take them.

198
00:08:03,579 --> 00:08:04,577
I won't stand on ceremony then.

199
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,660
Hurry up.

200
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:09,388
By the way, Tian Zhen,

201
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:10,697
have you made up your mind?

202
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,297
Will you do your Ph.D. at college

203
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,419
or the hospital?

204
00:08:14,019 --> 00:08:15,019
I'm not in a hurry.

205
00:08:15,699 --> 00:08:16,699
You're not in a hurry?

206
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:17,900
Shi Yan, you hear that?

207
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,223
He's not in a hurry.

208
00:08:19,306 --> 00:08:21,133
Tian Zhen's starting point
is my end point.

209
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:22,578
This time, you're wrong.

210
00:08:22,661 --> 00:08:23,737
I'm not pursuing my study in a college

211
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:24,737
or a hospital.

212
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,690
My father is holding
a TCM apprentice class.

213
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:27,780
I'll study there.

214
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:28,940
Mr Wu has agreed to it.

215
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,459
Apprentice class?

216
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,220
Can I attend it too?

217
00:09:03,579 --> 00:09:04,579
See you around.

218
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:06,699
I think it's better

219
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,775
if we never see each other again.

220
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,916
Look at all these food delivery riders.

221
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,459
Can I register for this?

222
00:09:46,459 --> 00:09:48,100
Do you even know what this is?

223
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:50,019
I do.

224
00:09:51,579 --> 00:09:52,557
Do you know him?

225
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,293
(Ren Xin Zheng's TCM Apprentice Class)

226
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,100
To be a student of TCM,

227
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:58,497
I think we must be learning

228
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,800
to save lives, right?

229
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,360
Yeah.

230
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,720
Okay.

231
00:10:07,579 --> 00:10:09,540
This should be
the best option for me now.

232
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,248
I'll register for it right now.

233
00:10:16,113 --> 00:10:18,680
(Yang Xiao Hong)

234
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:31,780
Hello, Mum?

235
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:32,900
Quan.

236
00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:34,720
Listen.

237
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,296
Just now, the village chief
and village secretary

238
00:10:37,379 --> 00:10:38,780
visited us.

239
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,176
They were praising you.

240
00:10:41,259 --> 00:10:42,619
They said you made us proud.

241
00:10:43,579 --> 00:10:44,697
(You have the highest
academic qualification)

242
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,259
(in our village.)

243
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:47,496
(Hubby, )

244
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:48,496
(come here.)

245
00:10:48,579 --> 00:10:50,499
Talk to your son. Come on.

246
00:10:51,019 --> 00:10:52,056
Once you get to work

247
00:10:52,139 --> 00:10:53,183
and start earning money,

248
00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:54,976
remember to give us some of it.

249
00:10:55,059 --> 00:10:56,059
(Don't forget.)

250
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,137
(You still have a younger brother
who'll attend school soon.)

251
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,655
(We can't afford to support him.)

252
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,340
Dad, I got it.

253
00:11:02,444 --> 00:11:03,444
By the way, Dad,

254
00:11:03,699 --> 00:11:06,376
our principal will be holding
an advanced course.

255
00:11:06,459 --> 00:11:07,817
He has invited a lot of experts
to join his course.

256
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,056
(I wish to join it.)

257
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:10,944
What?

258
00:11:11,027 --> 00:11:12,027
Advanced course?

259
00:11:12,459 --> 00:11:13,936
(I thought you already graduated?)

260
00:11:14,019 --> 00:11:15,280
(Why are you still studying?)

261
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,220
(Did you not get a job?)

262
00:11:18,579 --> 00:11:19,900
I got one.

263
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:21,459
The principal...

264
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:23,541
The principal helped me to get one.

265
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:27,541
Don't worry. I'll have a bright future
if I work under him.

266
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:29,457
I know now!

267
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,616
You mean
the Grade A tertiary hospital, right?

268
00:11:31,699 --> 00:11:34,097
(Remember to work hard then.)

269
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,485
(Strive to make our village, )

270
00:11:35,699 --> 00:11:36,617
(our community, )

271
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,780
And our district

272
00:11:38,019 --> 00:11:39,019
proud,

273
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,220
you hear me?

274
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,817
Okay.

275
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,900
I...

276
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:44,056
My superior is looking for me.

277
00:11:44,139 --> 00:11:45,220
Mum, I need to go.

278
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,437
(From Jiangzhou City No.1 Hospital.)

279
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,557
(Mr Zhao Li Quan,
thanks for coming to the interview.)

280
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,858
(We regret to inform you that you're
rejected. All the best in the future.)

281
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,056
You want to join it

282
00:12:01,139 --> 00:12:02,618
when you don't know what it's for?

283
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:03,936
My sense is tingling.

284
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:05,616
I'm sure you won't make
the wrong decision.

285
00:12:05,699 --> 00:12:07,697
Think about it. You're not
attending college

286
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:08,617
or joining the hospital for this.

287
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,700
That means both of those options
must be inferior to your current one.

288
00:12:12,259 --> 00:12:13,616
Tell your father about it, okay?

289
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:14,699
Let me join it too.

290
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,980
Welcome, Zhao.

291
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:26,579
You're going too?

292
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:28,900
Welcome.

293
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,960
(The willow is green, )

294
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,984
(the orioles fly, the grass grows, )

295
00:12:39,067 --> 00:12:40,067
(the wheat sprouts, )

296
00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:42,645
(and the canola flowers smell good.)

297
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,152
(Chunfen (The middle of spring))

298
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,372
We're here to work as labourers.

299
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,139
Mr Ren does

300
00:12:55,459 --> 00:12:56,819
utilize us to the fullest, huh?

301
00:13:01,459 --> 00:13:02,459
Here you go.

302
00:13:06,139 --> 00:13:07,660
The first in Jiangzhou?

303
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,616
They're making it as if
they're going to hold this again

304
00:13:10,699 --> 00:13:11,736
and spread it across the country.

305
00:13:11,819 --> 00:13:12,939
That won't do.

306
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,443
We need to spread it
throughout the world.

307
00:13:15,579 --> 00:13:17,100
Throughout the world?

308
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:20,257
Do you guys know that Western medicine
is the main treatment for the world?

309
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,897
Do you guys know that
we're able to extend our lifespan

310
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,502
due to the invention of Penicillin?

311
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,056
We have never denied

312
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:26,536
the contribution of Western medicine
to the world.

313
00:13:26,619 --> 00:13:28,446
You guys are the ones
who keep denying TCM.

314
00:13:29,019 --> 00:13:30,019
Fine.

315
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,220
Tell me then.

316
00:13:31,619 --> 00:13:32,577
Give me a reason

317
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,660
not to deny TCM.

318
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:35,019
Give me a hand.

319
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,663
Shi Yan, check the height for us.

320
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:41,780
Stand properly then.

321
00:13:44,588 --> 00:13:45,588
Tian Zhen,

322
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,699
raise it slightly.

323
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,840
Quan,

324
00:13:53,939 --> 00:13:55,619
make it looser. That's right.

325
00:13:59,684 --> 00:14:00,496
Okay.

326
00:14:00,579 --> 00:14:01,666
You can hold it in place.

327
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,900
A goddess has appeared in this hellhole.

328
00:14:18,939 --> 00:14:21,379
Liu Chang Qing is a scammer.

329
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:23,257
I guess he gave us this piece of land

330
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,416
so that

331
00:14:24,499 --> 00:14:26,259
we could help him reclaim it.

332
00:14:26,939 --> 00:14:27,936
There's nothing here.

333
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:29,106
And everything is broken.

334
00:14:29,579 --> 00:14:31,056
In the future, if he wants you
to do acupuncture on him,

335
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:32,459
do it where it hurts.

336
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,939
Let's stop being picky.

337
00:14:37,499 --> 00:14:38,939
We have a good place here.

338
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,860
It's a great start.

339
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,736
Look at this lousy window.

340
00:14:42,819 --> 00:14:43,900
I can't even close it.

341
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:46,019
Come.

342
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,264
Just leave it open then.

343
00:14:54,459 --> 00:14:55,459
Leave it open?

344
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,939
You...

345
00:14:57,939 --> 00:14:59,019
Where's Tou Tou?

346
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,057
I thought she was grabbing a cloth?

347
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:02,340
Why isn't she back yet?

348
00:15:03,019 --> 00:15:04,017
Tou Tou,

349
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,056
I thought you were bringing us a cloth?

350
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:07,257
The water supply stopped.

351
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,897
I went to turn on the main switch.

352
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,900
The water is yellow.

353
00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:13,540
-Is that so?
-Wait.

354
00:15:13,876 --> 00:15:14,856
Why don't you

355
00:15:14,939 --> 00:15:16,176
tell Liu Chang Qing

356
00:15:16,259 --> 00:15:17,057
to hire someone

357
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,379
to fix the doors and windows first?

358
00:15:19,819 --> 00:15:21,017
If not,

359
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,416
the wind will get in constantly.

360
00:15:22,499 --> 00:15:23,980
Our bodies can't take it.

361
00:15:25,939 --> 00:15:27,657
We should be grateful
that he's allowing us

362
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,100
to use this place for free.

363
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,176
Maybe he'll give us

364
00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:32,176
what you want

365
00:15:32,259 --> 00:15:33,259
after some time.

366
00:15:34,379 --> 00:15:35,856
What I want?

367
00:15:35,939 --> 00:15:37,220
More like what you want.

368
00:15:37,459 --> 00:15:38,900
I'm not as lucky as you.

369
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:41,097
You always attract the things you want

370
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,699
to you.

371
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,820
But me?

372
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,056
Whenever I want something,

373
00:15:45,139 --> 00:15:47,376
I need to work for it.

374
00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:49,056
Why are you reading these?

375
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:50,139
It's full of dust.

376
00:15:51,139 --> 00:15:52,416
When the students are here,

377
00:15:52,499 --> 00:15:54,586
we'll use the first period
to clean the place up.

378
00:15:54,699 --> 00:15:56,019
When it's dawn,

379
00:15:56,379 --> 00:15:57,540
everything will be clean.

380
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:58,818
Both the exterior and interior
will be clean.

381
00:15:58,901 --> 00:16:00,459
We'll clean the paths too.

382
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:01,900
Okay?

383
00:16:02,139 --> 00:16:03,139
I was wondering.

384
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,176
This...

385
00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:07,496
-I thought I was lucky enough
-Be careful.

386
00:16:07,579 --> 00:16:08,753
To get into something nice.

387
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:09,900
I was wondering

388
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:11,736
why you took me as your successor.

389
00:16:11,819 --> 00:16:12,736
Now I know.

390
00:16:12,819 --> 00:16:13,819
Being a successor

391
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:15,884
is worse than being a janitor.

392
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:18,697
You told me to come
so that I could clean the place for you.

393
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,499
Isn't it good to do cleaning duties?

394
00:16:21,579 --> 00:16:23,579
If the worldly air is clean,

395
00:16:24,459 --> 00:16:25,496
our spirits will be calmed.

396
00:16:25,579 --> 00:16:26,660
Enough already.

397
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,860
A smooth flow will produce
constant qi of yang.

398
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,137
Even if there is illness,

399
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,264
one shall not be harmed.

400
00:16:36,019 --> 00:16:37,019
What does that mean?

401
00:16:37,819 --> 00:16:39,736
That's part of Questions of
Organic and Fundamental Nature.

402
00:16:39,819 --> 00:16:40,860
That means

403
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,856
if you clean both
the interior and exterior,

404
00:16:43,939 --> 00:16:45,496
you can be just like me,

405
00:16:45,579 --> 00:16:47,259
you can ascend

406
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:48,579
to the heavens,

407
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,340
burrow underground.

408
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,056
You can do whatever you want to do

409
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,220
and meet whoever you want to meet.

410
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,740
You must be kidding me.

411
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:01,100
There's no way that can happen.

412
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,740
You think you can do a back flip

413
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,416
and reach another mountain
like what we see in the cartoons?

414
00:17:04,499 --> 00:17:05,739
I can't do backflips.

415
00:17:06,019 --> 00:17:07,420
But I can achieve

416
00:17:08,219 --> 00:17:09,277
my dream without any issues.

417
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,296
Look.

418
00:17:10,379 --> 00:17:12,619
I just need to think of it.

419
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:15,859
Done.

420
00:17:17,499 --> 00:17:18,499
Really?

421
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:21,099
Of course.

422
00:17:28,499 --> 00:17:30,717
Please let the banks transfer
all their money to me.

423
00:17:35,979 --> 00:17:37,420
Money means nothing.

424
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,060
When you become truly capable,

425
00:17:39,219 --> 00:17:40,741
you won't care about money by then.

426
00:17:40,987 --> 00:17:41,987
Tell me then.

427
00:17:42,099 --> 00:17:43,296
What's better than money?

428
00:17:43,379 --> 00:17:44,536
Plenty of things are better than money.

429
00:17:44,619 --> 00:17:46,780
Money is just a lowly pleasure
that people seek.

430
00:17:47,259 --> 00:17:48,420
When you're truly capable,

431
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,580
money means nothing.

432
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,099
You're wrong.

433
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:55,056
You can't do anything without money.

434
00:17:55,139 --> 00:17:56,416
If you had money,

435
00:17:56,499 --> 00:17:57,737
you would've built a school

436
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,296
in the middle of the city.

437
00:17:59,379 --> 00:18:00,497
If you had money,

438
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,656
you would hold your meetings

439
00:18:01,739 --> 00:18:02,896
in the best office you could find.

440
00:18:02,979 --> 00:18:03,776
Look at you.

441
00:18:03,859 --> 00:18:04,903
You're penniless, right?

442
00:18:05,139 --> 00:18:06,577
That's why you have

443
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,820
to do all these stupid things.

444
00:18:12,219 --> 00:18:13,536
Tou Tou, be careful.

445
00:18:13,619 --> 00:18:14,859
Be careful not to fall.

446
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:16,219
Tou Tou,

447
00:18:17,499 --> 00:18:20,099
you should wear another
cotton pants tomorrow.

448
00:18:20,499 --> 00:18:22,737
It's so cold. You shouldn't
let your ankle be exposed.

449
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:23,820
Mr Ren.

450
00:18:25,499 --> 00:18:26,656
I checked the bed

451
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:27,870
that we'll be sleeping on.

452
00:18:28,219 --> 00:18:29,296
The mattress is too thin.

453
00:18:29,379 --> 00:18:30,497
It's tough to sleep on it.

454
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,776
I'm afraid Tian Zhen will not
be able to get used to it.

455
00:18:31,859 --> 00:18:34,016
Why don't you let him
stay at home tonight?

456
00:18:34,099 --> 00:18:35,139
He's not that delicate.

457
00:18:35,499 --> 00:18:36,499
It's not that tough.

458
00:18:54,979 --> 00:18:56,460
I was wondering who it was.

459
00:18:57,499 --> 00:18:58,497
From now on, we'll be dormmates.

460
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,417
We're staying together.

461
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,327
I'll bring your stuff inside.
What's wrong?

462
00:19:01,739 --> 00:19:03,540
Guys, come and register your name first.

463
00:19:05,259 --> 00:19:06,660
Please write your name here.

464
00:19:07,243 --> 00:19:08,243
This is my name.

465
00:19:10,099 --> 00:19:11,136
I mean your genuine name.

466
00:19:11,219 --> 00:19:12,379
Not your nickname.

467
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:14,339
You need our genuine names here?

468
00:19:14,859 --> 00:19:16,456
Do you need to check our household
registers and our ID cards too?

469
00:19:16,539 --> 00:19:17,497
What about this?

470
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,817
Show me your teaching
qualifications first.

471
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,900
I need to check it.

472
00:19:20,219 --> 00:19:22,339
So, our superior is here
to monitor us, huh?

473
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,339
Are you a TCM paediatrician?

474
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:31,667
I'm a Master of Medicine.

475
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,760
Western Medicine.

476
00:19:33,859 --> 00:19:34,859
Master, you know?

477
00:19:45,499 --> 00:19:46,397
Doctor?

478
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,296
Tian Zhen,

479
00:19:47,379 --> 00:19:49,296
I think we need to check
their household registers.

480
00:19:49,379 --> 00:19:51,771
If not, they can come up
with all kinds of funny titles.

481
00:20:04,739 --> 00:20:06,540
Doctor, understand?

482
00:20:08,859 --> 00:20:10,580
Not only

483
00:20:11,619 --> 00:20:12,417
are you guys holding

484
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,296
the apprentice class
at such a remote place,

485
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:16,858
but you guys also don't serve us
any tea during tea break.

486
00:20:18,099 --> 00:20:19,099
What?

487
00:20:19,979 --> 00:20:20,738
Tea break?

488
00:20:20,821 --> 00:20:22,099
What's a tea break?

489
00:20:28,139 --> 00:20:29,437
-Is she done?
-No.

490
00:20:31,099 --> 00:20:32,099
Ms Rebecca,

491
00:20:32,499 --> 00:20:33,820
you won't get to try

492
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:35,700
this 1982 Chinese tea elsewhere.

493
00:20:41,339 --> 00:20:42,339
Your name is

494
00:20:42,499 --> 00:20:43,499
Roubecca?

495
00:20:45,499 --> 00:20:47,847
It's my first time seeing someone
with the surname Rou.

496
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:55,259
Stop pulling a long face.

497
00:20:55,499 --> 00:20:57,219
Smile. Try to be happy.

498
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,339
Don't you think so?

499
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,120
Tian Zhen,

500
00:21:07,219 --> 00:21:08,219
sit here.

501
00:21:18,859 --> 00:21:19,859
Tou Tou.

502
00:21:24,259 --> 00:21:25,259
Okay.

503
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:40,339
Tou Tou.

504
00:21:42,507 --> 00:21:43,296
My dear!

505
00:21:43,379 --> 00:21:44,460
My dear?

506
00:21:44,979 --> 00:21:45,979
Who are you?

507
00:21:47,019 --> 00:21:48,019
I'm her roommate.

508
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,176
She's my dear alright.

509
00:21:49,259 --> 00:21:50,694
And that's none of your business.

510
00:21:52,219 --> 00:21:53,176
Why are you here?

511
00:21:53,259 --> 00:21:54,136
It's like this.

512
00:21:54,219 --> 00:21:55,656
I'm very interested in TCM.

513
00:21:55,739 --> 00:21:58,019
That's why I'm here to sit in
on the course.

514
00:21:58,859 --> 00:21:59,859
She's here to learn.

515
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:00,818
Not everyone

516
00:22:00,901 --> 00:22:03,176
can attend our apprentice class.

517
00:22:03,259 --> 00:22:04,259
I'm a nurse.

518
00:22:04,379 --> 00:22:05,737
It's hard for me to
finally get a day off.

519
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,516
Please just let me attend it this time.

520
00:22:09,099 --> 00:22:10,317
Which hospital are you from?

521
00:22:10,619 --> 00:22:12,228
People's Hospital, the ER department.

522
00:22:14,019 --> 00:22:14,776
You may sit.

523
00:22:14,859 --> 00:22:15,776
I knew it. Come.

524
00:22:15,859 --> 00:22:16,859
Let's sit together.

525
00:22:17,499 --> 00:22:18,416
Why were you looking for me?

526
00:22:18,499 --> 00:22:19,499
Alright, my students.

527
00:22:21,219 --> 00:22:22,263
Our TCM apprentice class

528
00:22:22,739 --> 00:22:24,859
will officially begin today.

529
00:22:25,019 --> 00:22:26,219
From today onward,

530
00:22:27,099 --> 00:22:30,099
we're fellow learners of the ways of TCM.

531
00:22:31,011 --> 00:22:32,011
Tell me.

532
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,720
-Where's the hunk?
-Guys, please follow me.

533
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,176
The first guy who's sitting
beside the window.

534
00:22:37,259 --> 00:22:38,607
Let us bow to our predecessors,

535
00:22:38,788 --> 00:22:39,788
the Yellow Emperor

536
00:22:40,219 --> 00:22:41,219
and Confucius.

537
00:22:42,645 --> 00:22:43,649
Is he good-looking?

538
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,776
Not bad.

539
00:22:44,859 --> 00:22:46,099
He's pretty cool.

540
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,480
He's my cup of tea.

541
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:48,900
Zhang Zhongjing.

542
00:22:52,979 --> 00:22:54,066
Let's bow to them thrice.

543
00:22:54,739 --> 00:22:55,900
Guys, please stand up.

544
00:22:56,259 --> 00:22:57,416
Did he say the emperor?

545
00:22:57,499 --> 00:22:58,499
-Get up!
-Wait.

546
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,296
The Qing empire was eradicated long ago.

547
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:02,771
Why are we bowing to an emperor?

548
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:21,111
You may sit.

549
00:23:26,499 --> 00:23:27,619
This book

550
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,553
is called Virtue of A Great Physician.

551
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,739
Let's read it together

552
00:23:32,219 --> 00:23:34,379
before we begin our class.

553
00:23:34,739 --> 00:23:35,957
Virtue of A Great Physician.

554
00:23:36,499 --> 00:23:37,859
Virtue of A Great Physician.

555
00:23:38,619 --> 00:23:41,019
By Sun Simiao of Tang.

556
00:23:42,019 --> 00:23:43,660
Zhang Zhan said,

557
00:23:43,979 --> 00:23:46,217
“The reason why the methods in
the classics are so difficult to grasp

558
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,697
in their essence is that they come
from such a lofty origin.”

559
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,221
Nowadays, there are diseases
that are identical on the inside

560
00:23:49,304 --> 00:23:50,600
but different on the outside,

561
00:23:50,859 --> 00:23:52,056
as well as diseases
that are different on the inside

562
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:53,400
but identical on the outside.

563
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:56,656
Therefore, abundance or emptiness in
the five yin organs and six yang organs

564
00:23:56,739 --> 00:23:59,139
and the free flow or
blockage of qi and blood

565
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:02,457
is certainly not something that
can be observed by only eyes and ears.

566
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,820
They must first be examined
by diagnosing signs.

567
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,499
There are floating and sinking,

568
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,700
relaxed and tight pulses...

569
00:24:10,219 --> 00:24:12,256
Stop dragging me.
I need to find your principal!

570
00:24:12,339 --> 00:24:13,257
It's alright.

571
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,936
Mr Ren, I need to tell you something.

572
00:24:15,019 --> 00:24:16,019
Wait.

573
00:24:16,139 --> 00:24:17,296
I'm not Mr Ren.

574
00:24:17,379 --> 00:24:18,940
Mr Ren had already resigned.

575
00:24:19,219 --> 00:24:20,536
I'm the new principal.

576
00:24:20,619 --> 00:24:21,536
Do you need something from him?

577
00:24:21,619 --> 00:24:22,619
He resigned?

578
00:24:22,859 --> 00:24:23,776
That's impossible.

579
00:24:23,859 --> 00:24:25,555
I thought he was still holding classes?

580
00:24:26,019 --> 00:24:27,497
He did hold an apprentice class.

581
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:28,580
However, it's not here.

582
00:24:28,699 --> 00:24:29,699
Where is it then?

583
00:24:30,379 --> 00:24:31,257
Calm down.

584
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:33,499
Tell me what's the issue first.

585
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,536
You won't understand.
I need to speak with him.

586
00:24:35,619 --> 00:24:36,619
Come back.

587
00:24:36,741 --> 00:24:37,900
Do you know where he is?

588
00:24:38,499 --> 00:24:39,817
Where is he?

589
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,979
Tell me first.

590
00:24:41,219 --> 00:24:42,219
Why exactly

591
00:24:42,739 --> 00:24:43,783
are you looking for him?

592
00:24:45,499 --> 00:24:46,499
There's a murderer

593
00:24:47,739 --> 00:24:49,460
in his class!

594
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,296
When it comes to studying,
we need to follow the right ways

595
00:24:54,379 --> 00:24:55,510
and start at a high point.

596
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:56,776
We read

597
00:24:56,859 --> 00:24:58,460
Virtue of A Great Physician

598
00:24:58,619 --> 00:25:00,060
before our class just now.

599
00:25:00,764 --> 00:25:01,803
In the future,

600
00:25:02,379 --> 00:25:04,936
we must read it before
we start our classes.

601
00:25:05,019 --> 00:25:06,379
This way, the book itself

602
00:25:06,739 --> 00:25:08,700
will be integrated into
our blood and soul

603
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,859
after four years.

604
00:25:11,019 --> 00:25:12,049
We shall strive

605
00:25:12,499 --> 00:25:15,979
to become the modern
Sun Simiao and Zhang Zhongjing.

606
00:25:16,619 --> 00:25:17,820
I don't know who they are.

607
00:25:18,219 --> 00:25:19,259
How can I become them?

608
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,379
You'll know them eventually.

609
00:25:24,019 --> 00:25:25,979
When we aim high, we achieve mediocrity.

610
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:29,099
When we aim for mediocrity,
we achieve nothing.

611
00:25:30,499 --> 00:25:31,619
We need

612
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:33,176
-Keep it away.
-to have lofty ambitions.

613
00:25:33,259 --> 00:25:35,977
Even if we can't reach the standards
of Zhang Zhongjing,

614
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,040
at least

615
00:25:37,123 --> 00:25:38,123
we'll be someone

616
00:25:38,739 --> 00:25:40,783
who strive for more than
just basic necessities.

617
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:44,820
What's your question?

618
00:25:45,859 --> 00:25:46,979
I beg to differ.

619
00:25:48,099 --> 00:25:48,937
I think striving for basic necessities

620
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,300
is noble enough nowadays.

621
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,499
If so, are you the same
as a boar in a forest

622
00:25:53,739 --> 00:25:56,540
or a jackal in the plains?

623
00:25:57,259 --> 00:25:58,337
Of course I'm different.

624
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,896
We can't just strive for
basic necessities.

625
00:25:59,979 --> 00:26:01,416
We must understand

626
00:26:01,499 --> 00:26:03,499
the true meaning behind our existence.

627
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,460
The word "Ming"

628
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,139
is very advanced.

629
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,296
Once you understand
the meaning of your existence,

630
00:26:16,379 --> 00:26:18,016
you will hold the Sun and Moon
in your heart.

631
00:26:18,099 --> 00:26:19,099
You'll glow splendidly.

632
00:26:19,739 --> 00:26:20,656
My wish

633
00:26:20,739 --> 00:26:22,261
is to become one who is enlightened

634
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,379
together with you all.

635
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,680
If,

636
00:26:25,979 --> 00:26:27,979
one of you guys

637
00:26:28,339 --> 00:26:31,499
do end up becoming the modern Confucius
or Zhang Zhongjing,

638
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,820
I'll be honoured.

639
00:26:36,499 --> 00:26:37,586
What are you laughing at?

640
00:26:40,139 --> 00:26:41,416
I was reminded of a story.

641
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:42,586
Is there something funny?

642
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,219
To educate people

643
00:26:49,099 --> 00:26:50,339
is my dream.

644
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,016
I don't expect

645
00:26:52,099 --> 00:26:53,420
to get anything from you all.

646
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,859
This is my only wish.

647
00:26:55,859 --> 00:26:56,979
No matter

648
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,019
for what reason you come,

649
00:26:59,379 --> 00:27:00,497
and what identity you possess,

650
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:01,619
I hope that you guys

651
00:27:02,019 --> 00:27:04,060
must cherish your time here.

652
00:27:05,259 --> 00:27:07,019
I hope you can do something

653
00:27:07,499 --> 00:27:08,700
when you see a patient

654
00:27:08,916 --> 00:27:10,076
or are in an emergency.

655
00:27:10,259 --> 00:27:11,776
I don't want you guys to regret it

656
00:27:11,859 --> 00:27:15,780
when you don't learn something useful
here that you could use out there.

657
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,640
Master, if, one day,

658
00:27:21,379 --> 00:27:23,219
one of your disciples

659
00:27:23,859 --> 00:27:25,207
has become the modern Confucius

660
00:27:25,499 --> 00:27:26,499
or Zhang Zhongjing,

661
00:27:26,859 --> 00:27:28,136
can you tell him

662
00:27:28,219 --> 00:27:30,700
that we're in the same sect?

663
00:27:36,379 --> 00:27:38,739
Although this is an apprentice class,

664
00:27:39,019 --> 00:27:40,259
I still hope

665
00:27:41,219 --> 00:27:42,776
that you guys can call me your teacher.

666
00:27:42,859 --> 00:27:44,294
I shall call you all my students.

667
00:27:44,499 --> 00:27:45,630
Don't call me your master.

668
00:27:46,219 --> 00:27:47,219
Understood.

669
00:27:48,236 --> 00:27:49,280
What did you understand?

670
00:27:52,259 --> 00:27:54,296
Master, we definitely won't tell
others that you're our master

671
00:27:54,379 --> 00:27:55,900
when we get into trouble.

672
00:27:58,499 --> 00:27:59,499
You guys understand?

673
00:28:11,859 --> 00:28:12,900
Alright, guys.

674
00:28:13,219 --> 00:28:15,099
This is our first lesson.

675
00:28:15,259 --> 00:28:16,540
We'll use the first period

676
00:28:16,739 --> 00:28:18,497
to clean up the courtyard

677
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,859
and make the road smoother.

678
00:28:20,019 --> 00:28:21,619
This way, we can

679
00:28:21,859 --> 00:28:24,379
travel in and out of the place smoothly.

680
00:28:24,739 --> 00:28:25,826
Alright. Class dismissed.

681
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,919
Xing Xing, stop.

682
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,280
I'll do it for you.

683
00:28:32,555 --> 00:28:33,817
Let me do it. You can rest.

684
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:34,900
Be careful.

685
00:28:48,988 --> 00:28:49,988
What?

686
00:28:50,588 --> 00:28:51,588
Get to work.

687
00:28:52,428 --> 00:28:53,428
No, I won't.

688
00:28:54,219 --> 00:28:55,460
I told you already.

689
00:28:56,019 --> 00:28:57,056
Just give me

690
00:28:57,139 --> 00:28:58,536
the money

691
00:28:58,619 --> 00:29:00,016
and I'll do your chores for you, okay?

692
00:29:00,099 --> 00:29:01,099
I don't need your help.

693
00:29:01,859 --> 00:29:03,512
Someone will volunteer to help me out.

694
00:29:04,979 --> 00:29:05,979
Who?

695
00:29:21,379 --> 00:29:22,797
Do you even know how to sweep the floor?

696
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,601
You'll only make it dirtier.

697
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:25,896
I don't know how to sweep the floor.

698
00:29:25,979 --> 00:29:27,176
But I'm at least better than

699
00:29:27,259 --> 00:29:29,060
those who speak without doing anything.

700
00:29:29,979 --> 00:29:30,979
Watch out.

701
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:32,820
Go away.

702
00:29:35,652 --> 00:29:36,652
Stop talking.

703
00:29:36,739 --> 00:29:37,739
Get to work.

704
00:29:43,139 --> 00:29:44,139
Hey, brat.

705
00:29:55,979 --> 00:29:57,139
Why are you staring at me?

706
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,243
I'll gouge your eyes if you keep staring.

707
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:02,994
You're still staring at me?

708
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,146
Did you think I was joking with you?

709
00:30:09,219 --> 00:30:10,393
You're still staring at me?

710
00:30:12,395 --> 00:30:13,395
You're still doing it?

711
00:30:17,147 --> 00:30:18,176
-I...
-Yang Xiao Hong!

712
00:30:18,259 --> 00:30:19,136
What are you doing?

713
00:30:19,219 --> 00:30:20,437
She's here to cause trouble!

714
00:30:20,859 --> 00:30:21,657
What are you doing?

715
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:23,416
Yang Xiao Hong! You murderer!

716
00:30:23,499 --> 00:30:24,499
What's going on?

717
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,048
-Return my husband to me!
-Stop!

718
00:30:26,259 --> 00:30:27,259
Stop it!

719
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:29,457
My family is shattered because of you!

720
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:30,817
-Stop it!
-I'll make you pay!

721
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:31,896
What are you doing?

722
00:30:31,979 --> 00:30:33,099
What's going on?

723
00:30:33,339 --> 00:30:34,992
You guys are fighting over chores now?

724
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:36,099
What's going on?

725
00:30:36,405 --> 00:30:37,405
Wu Shan Dao,

726
00:30:37,859 --> 00:30:39,099
is this your work?

727
00:30:40,096 --> 00:30:41,416
Junior, you're blaming it
on the wrong person.

728
00:30:41,499 --> 00:30:42,936
-You guys, stop this!
-Tian Zhen!

729
00:30:43,019 --> 00:30:44,219
-Come here.
-It's like this.

730
00:30:44,499 --> 00:30:46,416
She went to the college to find Senior.

731
00:30:46,499 --> 00:30:47,859
I thought she was serious.

732
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:50,339
Besides, I was afraid that
something bad might happen.

733
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:51,580
You guys, stop it!

734
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,219
That's why I brought her here.

735
00:30:53,379 --> 00:30:55,099
I never expected this to happen!

736
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,739
Stop fighting!

737
00:30:57,859 --> 00:30:58,859
Sun Tou Tou!

738
00:30:59,019 --> 00:31:00,759
I told you already!
Stop pulling my hair!

739
00:31:01,139 --> 00:31:02,313
All of you, stop right now!

740
00:31:05,259 --> 00:31:06,694
Are you guys done messing around?

741
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,300
Let's talk this over.

742
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,656
It's alright.

743
00:31:13,739 --> 00:31:14,979
What exactly is going on?

744
00:31:15,619 --> 00:31:16,619
It's her!

745
00:31:17,019 --> 00:31:17,976
That madam,

746
00:31:18,059 --> 00:31:19,512
she came and attacked
Roubecca straight away.

747
00:31:19,595 --> 00:31:20,595
I saw what she did.

748
00:31:21,619 --> 00:31:22,820
Let's talk this over.

749
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,416
The Mr Ren you're looking for
is over there.

750
00:31:25,499 --> 00:31:26,497
If you need anything

751
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:27,617
or need to look for someone,

752
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:28,737
just tell him.

753
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,099
Don't try to be violent.

754
00:31:31,859 --> 00:31:32,940
She's the person

755
00:31:33,219 --> 00:31:34,219
I'm looking for!

756
00:31:34,619 --> 00:31:35,979
You murderer!

757
00:31:41,219 --> 00:31:42,219
Madam,

758
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,900
I don't even know who you are.

759
00:31:45,139 --> 00:31:46,580
But I have to remind you of this.

760
00:31:46,979 --> 00:31:48,536
According to Clause 2 of Article 246

761
00:31:48,619 --> 00:31:51,019
of Criminal Law of
the People's Republic of China,

762
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:53,896
whoever, by violence or other methods,

763
00:31:53,979 --> 00:31:55,737
publicly humiliates another person

764
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:56,738
or invents stories to defame him

765
00:31:56,821 --> 00:31:58,619
will be convicted of slander!

766
00:31:59,099 --> 00:32:00,882
You're the top lawyer
of Jiangzhou indeed.

767
00:32:01,259 --> 00:32:02,339
Ms Yang,

768
00:32:02,619 --> 00:32:04,060
you may not know me,

769
00:32:04,859 --> 00:32:06,859
but I'm sure you know this person.

770
00:32:07,499 --> 00:32:08,619
Kong Zhi Yuan!

771
00:32:17,499 --> 00:32:18,499
Mr Kong, the lawyer?

772
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,536
-You're his...
-I'm the wife

773
00:32:22,619 --> 00:32:24,739
of the man who died because of you!

774
00:32:24,979 --> 00:32:25,817
Enough.

775
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,139
Calm down.

776
00:32:35,379 --> 00:32:36,379
I'm sorry.

777
00:32:38,088 --> 00:32:39,940
I'm very sorry about
your husband's death.

778
00:32:42,499 --> 00:32:43,760
But I didn't cause his death.

779
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,099
You didn't?

780
00:32:45,219 --> 00:32:46,339
You murdered him!

781
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,536
You forced him to a dead end

782
00:32:47,619 --> 00:32:48,859
in order to win the lawsuit!

783
00:32:49,499 --> 00:32:51,379
You vicious woman!

784
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:53,019
Why didn't you save him?

785
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,416
Why did you just let him die

786
00:32:55,499 --> 00:32:56,900
in front of you?

787
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,619
Roubecca, say something.

788
00:33:03,019 --> 00:33:04,379
Come on.

789
00:33:08,339 --> 00:33:09,739
I have nothing to say.

790
00:33:10,099 --> 00:33:11,420
Are you sure?

791
00:33:12,099 --> 00:33:14,139
You cold-blooded killer!

792
00:33:14,379 --> 00:33:15,900
You'll suffer a terrible fate!

793
00:33:16,859 --> 00:33:18,900
I'll haunt you as a ghost after I die!

794
00:33:19,219 --> 00:33:20,536
Return my husband to me!

795
00:33:20,619 --> 00:33:22,099
Return my husband to me!

796
00:33:23,099 --> 00:33:25,619
You two can resolve your feud outside.

797
00:33:26,859 --> 00:33:28,099
I won't go out.

798
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,005
She has already lost her mind.

799
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:31,297
If I follow her outside,

800
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,540
she'll kill me.

801
00:33:33,979 --> 00:33:34,979
She's right.

802
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,180
Call the cops.

803
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:40,940
Don't leave!

804
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:42,878
You're not allowed to leave!

805
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:01,940
It's hysteria.

806
00:34:02,259 --> 00:34:03,300
Get me my needle pack.

807
00:34:14,859 --> 00:34:16,220
You must stop being emotional.

808
00:34:27,819 --> 00:34:30,296
Did you attack her vital point
or seal her movements?

809
00:34:30,379 --> 00:34:31,460
Why is she suddenly...

810
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,800
What happened just now?

811
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,420
Do you know that you're pregnant?

812
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,097
I'm pregnant?

813
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:40,339
Yes. However,

814
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:43,139
you're emotionally unstable.

815
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:46,819
You have a weak pulse.

816
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:49,137
It's hard to say
if you can keep the baby or not.

817
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,525
Send her to the hospital then.

818
00:34:50,636 --> 00:34:51,636
We have to.

819
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,760
-My car is over there.
-Okay.

820
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,417
I need to head to the city too.
I'll go together with them.

821
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,496
Okay.

822
00:34:56,579 --> 00:34:57,859
Come.

823
00:35:07,099 --> 00:35:07,898
Clean this place up.

824
00:35:07,981 --> 00:35:09,547
We still need to attend class later.

825
00:35:13,099 --> 00:35:14,056
Don't worry.

826
00:35:14,139 --> 00:35:15,989
Dr Song is the 15th generation
of a famous family of doctors

827
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:17,256
who specialises in
obstetrics and paediatrics.

828
00:35:17,339 --> 00:35:19,470
She'll definitely send you
to the hospital safely.

829
00:35:19,859 --> 00:35:20,859
You'll be fine.

830
00:35:36,339 --> 00:35:37,819
Did you kill her husband?

831
00:35:38,859 --> 00:35:39,940
Didn't you hear her?

832
00:35:40,099 --> 00:35:41,097
She said

833
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,660
that she caused her husband
to have a heart attack

834
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,339
with her silver tongue.

835
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,137
You're good at sweeping the floor,

836
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:49,097
but you're not eloquent at all.

837
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,256
You should stop provoking her.

838
00:35:50,339 --> 00:35:52,496
If not, you'll get a heart attack too,

839
00:35:52,579 --> 00:35:53,579
got it?

840
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,660
She's not breathing!

841
00:36:04,379 --> 00:36:06,180
Nurse, come and examine her!

842
00:36:18,819 --> 00:36:19,819
Get back to class.

843
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:24,700
Let's go.

844
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:26,900
You fools.

845
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,000
Roubecca, time for class.

846
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:47,220
Wait.

847
00:36:49,164 --> 00:36:49,976
Stop acting.

848
00:36:50,059 --> 00:36:51,698
They're already gone.

849
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:57,740
I guess I'll go first.

850
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:06,220
Rebecca?

851
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,420
Rebecca?

852
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,357
Everyone, don't gather around.

853
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,745
Give her some breathing space.

854
00:37:10,379 --> 00:37:11,379
Roubecca.

855
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:13,420
She's down for real?

856
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:17,420
Roubecca!

857
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:20,940
Roubecca?

858
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:27,677
She's alive.

859
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,760
She's back.

860
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,617
-I'll get the needles.
-They're over there!

861
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:33,859
Over here.

862
00:37:58,619 --> 00:37:59,660
I didn't.

863
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:03,020
I didn't murder him.

864
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:05,746
The person who wants to hear that
from you has already left.

865
00:38:06,099 --> 00:38:07,099
Roubecca,

866
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:09,180
you're truly impressive.

867
00:38:09,379 --> 00:38:11,097
You actually fell unconscious
only after your opponent left.

868
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,180
You're amazing.

869
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,539
Why is my shirt torn?

870
00:38:19,339 --> 00:38:20,579
Did you do it?

871
00:38:21,379 --> 00:38:22,257
I did it.

872
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:24,080
It was an emergency.
That's why I cut it.

873
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:26,180
Do you know how much this costs?

874
00:38:26,859 --> 00:38:27,937
It's Loro Piana, you know?

875
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:28,817
It's pure cashmere.

876
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,016
It costs 23,800 yuan.

877
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:31,230
You cut it just like that?

878
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,617
Is your life worth less than 23,800 yuan?

879
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:36,137
I wasn't saved by Western medicine
practitioners like you all.

880
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,460
Mr Ren saved me

881
00:38:37,859 --> 00:38:39,379
with acupuncture.

882
00:38:40,099 --> 00:38:42,377
You're such an ingrate.

883
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:43,577
Xing Xing was trying to you, you know?

884
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:45,226
How could you talk to her like that?

885
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,736
Fine then, famous lawyer.

886
00:38:46,819 --> 00:38:47,993
You can sue us if you like.

887
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,332
You wouldn't even get the chance

888
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,657
to wait for the ambulance to arrive
if Professor Ren wasn't here.

889
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:58,697
You can have the clip.

890
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:00,128
You don't need to give it back.

891
00:39:00,539 --> 00:39:01,377
This doesn't make sense.

892
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:03,260
This doesn't make sense at all.

893
00:39:03,539 --> 00:39:05,061
I think she's sick in the head too.

894
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,736
I was referring to what he did just now.

895
00:39:06,819 --> 00:39:07,658
He saved her with needles.

896
00:39:07,741 --> 00:39:09,139
That doesn't make sense.

897
00:39:09,819 --> 00:39:11,940
It's because you don't understand
how it works.

898
00:39:16,572 --> 00:39:17,572
This position.

899
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:20,438
There's a major tendon here
in front of the armpits.

900
00:39:21,139 --> 00:39:22,339
According to folklore,

901
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:24,536
there are nine locks in the human body.

902
00:39:24,619 --> 00:39:25,619
This is one of them.

903
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,286
It's called the Soul-returning Lock.

904
00:39:28,252 --> 00:39:29,252
Guys, remember this.

905
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,020
When you're in an emergency,

906
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:34,482
lift the major tendon in the front
of the armpits with all your might.

907
00:39:34,565 --> 00:39:35,565
Try to pull it.

908
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:37,900
Some patients might recover from it.

909
00:39:38,723 --> 00:39:39,723
This is amazing.

910
00:39:39,819 --> 00:39:40,776
Mr Ren,

911
00:39:40,859 --> 00:39:41,857
how long do I need to learn this

912
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,462
before I can apply it in real life?

913
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:45,736
This skill?

914
00:39:45,819 --> 00:39:47,373
-Five years?
-Five months?

915
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:49,657
TCM practitioners are usually old.

916
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:50,897
They're only valuable when they're old.

917
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:52,589
I think it'll take at least 50 years.

918
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,880
Five days.

919
00:39:56,292 --> 00:39:57,437
Five days?

920
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,256
That quick?

921
00:39:58,339 --> 00:39:59,056
Five days?

922
00:39:59,139 --> 00:40:00,056
Can anyone learn this?

923
00:40:00,139 --> 00:40:01,139
Yes.

924
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,696
Wait, sir.

925
00:40:02,779 --> 00:40:04,536
I have to learn this.

926
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:06,016
So, I can revive someone

927
00:40:06,099 --> 00:40:07,736
by pulling the tendon
in front of the armpits?

928
00:40:07,819 --> 00:40:08,819
I have to learn this.

929
00:40:10,307 --> 00:40:11,177
You're trying to run

930
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,617
before you learn how to walk, huh?

931
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:13,578
She's eager for instant success.

932
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:15,296
It only takes five days
to master this skill.

933
00:40:15,379 --> 00:40:17,579
However, it takes a lifetime for one

934
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,338
to understand the logic behind it.

935
00:40:20,421 --> 00:40:22,097
I don't need to learn
the logic behind it.

936
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:23,572
I just need to master the skill.

937
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:26,420
Mr Ren,

938
00:40:26,612 --> 00:40:27,892
you have to teach me this.

939
00:40:28,356 --> 00:40:30,636
Mr Kong fell unconscious in front of me.

940
00:40:30,819 --> 00:40:32,177
He might not be dead

941
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:33,782
if I knew how to do this back then.

942
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:35,819
Everyone only has one life.

943
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:39,139
His lifespan has nothing to do with you.

944
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,099
Such comparison

945
00:40:41,515 --> 00:40:42,515
is meaningless.

946
00:40:43,621 --> 00:40:44,621
Guys,

947
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:47,299
you all are new to the field.

948
00:40:47,819 --> 00:40:49,937
You don't understand the logic
and reasoning behind such skills.

949
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,020
That's why you cannot

950
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,260
apply them well.

951
00:40:53,139 --> 00:40:55,748
We can spend the rest of our lives
trying to figure that out.

952
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:56,858
However, I need to master

953
00:40:56,941 --> 00:40:58,460
this skill immediately.

954
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:00,037
I need to put what I've learned
into practice.

955
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,097
Mr Ren,

956
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,940
you were right this morning.

957
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:04,338
I want to be able to contribute

958
00:41:04,421 --> 00:41:05,736
to an emergency like this

959
00:41:05,819 --> 00:41:06,980
when the time does come.

960
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:10,203
And this is useful for the ER department.

961
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:11,725
Can you please teach me first?

962
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:12,857
I only have a limited
amount of time here.

963
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:13,818
I might not be able

964
00:41:13,901 --> 00:41:15,020
to attend the next class.

965
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:16,338
Yeah, we wish to learn this too.

966
00:41:16,421 --> 00:41:17,417
Yeah.

967
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,337
We want to learn this too.

968
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:19,577
We want to learn this immediately.

969
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:20,660
Alright.

970
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:22,180
For your sake,

971
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:25,177
we'll talk about TCM first-aid
in the next lesson.

972
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,260
Okay.

973
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,197
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

974
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,597
(are referenced from relevant
traditional Chinese medicine books)

975
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,985
(Do not use without medical advice)
