00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,958
(Gen Z)

2
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,050
(Episode 3)

3
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,813
8am.

4
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:02,027
I'm punctual.

5
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,419
Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic.

6
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:12,060
Questions of Organic
and Fundamental Nature?

7
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:13,860
From today onward,

8
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,099
you'll be a student of
the apprentice class.

9
00:02:16,779 --> 00:02:18,139
You'll learn TCM under me.

10
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,299
You'll do what I tell you to do.

11
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:31,779
I can't learn this.

12
00:02:32,139 --> 00:02:34,020
I'm not joking with you.

13
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,540
Since young, I'd get sleepy

14
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,500
whenever I read.

15
00:02:38,139 --> 00:02:39,700
I'd get giddy.

16
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,509
I'm serious.

17
00:02:41,539 --> 00:02:42,660
We already signed a contract.

18
00:02:44,179 --> 00:02:45,380
Even so,

19
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,340
there's no way I can learn this.

20
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,721
Why don't I

21
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,140
do some chores

22
00:02:54,539 --> 00:02:55,939
or cook for you instead?

23
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,179
Don't cross your legs.

24
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,269
Put it down.

25
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,819
Your right waist hurts.

26
00:03:08,539 --> 00:03:09,939
Your hip bone hurts too, right?

27
00:03:11,179 --> 00:03:11,996
Yeah.

28
00:03:13,539 --> 00:03:14,499
How did you know?

29
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,259
That's what you get for
crossing your legs.

30
00:03:17,619 --> 00:03:19,219
Not bad at all. You're pretty amazing.

31
00:03:19,219 --> 00:03:20,380
What kind of doctor are you?

32
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,420
The greatest kind.

33
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,380
How great are you?

34
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,380
My greatness exceeds your imagination.

35
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,140
If so, how great are you?

36
00:03:26,619 --> 00:03:28,179
Seems like you lack imagination.

37
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,660
Did you drink this morning?

38
00:03:30,179 --> 00:03:31,539
How many dishes did you consume
for you to get this drunk?

39
00:03:31,899 --> 00:03:33,700
I never eat anything when I drink.

40
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:36,740
Before this,

41
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,020
you said you were going to open a...

42
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,380
What was it again?

43
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,460
An apprentice class.

44
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,120
You think you can fool me
after getting drunk?

45
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:45,379
I never fool people.

46
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,680
Listen. I'll open an apprentice class.

47
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:49,099
Once I agree to do something,

48
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:52,819
no one can stop me.

49
00:03:53,659 --> 00:03:55,659
Look at what you're saying.

50
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:57,459
Try me if you dare.

51
00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:05,980
Kid.

52
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:10,380
Shi Yan.

53
00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:11,940
The data for the animal experiment

54
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:12,899
is out.

55
00:04:12,899 --> 00:04:14,300
Analyse it for me when you're free.

56
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:16,899
It's only been one week,

57
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:18,459
yet you've gotten cooler, huh?

58
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:20,019
Are you trying to be a tough guy now?

59
00:04:20,179 --> 00:04:21,060
Don't provoke me.

60
00:04:21,099 --> 00:04:21,980
I'm in a bad mood today.

61
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,179
What's wrong with you?

62
00:04:26,259 --> 00:04:27,780
It's all because of
TCM practitioners like you.

63
00:04:27,819 --> 00:04:28,899
We, doctors of Western medicine, had to
bear the blame because of your mistake.

64
00:04:31,099 --> 00:04:32,659
Don't be emotional.

65
00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:34,259
Emotion is the source of all evil.

66
00:04:36,019 --> 00:04:37,459
Did the parent of that child hit you?

67
00:04:37,459 --> 00:04:38,259
You don't say?

68
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:41,019
They insisted on believing the words

69
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:41,819
of a TCM practitioner.

70
00:04:41,899 --> 00:04:43,500
They're blaming it on us
when their child is sick.

71
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,500
You mustn't spout nonsense.

72
00:04:45,539 --> 00:04:47,580
What proof do you have to prove
that it was our mistake?

73
00:04:47,899 --> 00:04:48,899
Enough.

74
00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:50,627
I'm terrified of TCM practitioners now.

75
00:04:50,659 --> 00:04:52,500
-Nothing good will happen.
-Don't say that.

76
00:04:52,594 --> 00:04:54,074
Dr Peng.

77
00:04:54,659 --> 00:04:55,899
Shi Yan,

78
00:04:56,539 --> 00:04:59,220
I intend to ask you
to bring me out for more experiments.

79
00:05:00,179 --> 00:05:01,860
I don't understand you at all.

80
00:05:02,099 --> 00:05:03,019
You're a prince

81
00:05:03,019 --> 00:05:03,940
that hails from a TCM family.

82
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,980
Why are you trying to learn
Western medicine in secret?

83
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:07,619
Your father didn't agree to it
in the first place.

84
00:05:07,619 --> 00:05:09,459
Why are you taking the risk here?

85
00:05:09,619 --> 00:05:11,019
It's not like I'm learning it
for his sake.

86
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:12,619
Do I need to stop
just because he disagrees with it?

87
00:05:12,739 --> 00:05:13,588
What gives?

88
00:05:13,739 --> 00:05:14,539
Besides,

89
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,899
I want to prove to him

90
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,259
that TCM and Western medicine
can work in tandem.

91
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:20,797
Fine.

92
00:05:21,819 --> 00:05:23,739
Mr Ren, you're ambitious indeed.

93
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,899
Mr Ren, you're both ambitious
and talented.

94
00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:27,060
Ordinary men like us
can't afford to join your play.

95
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:27,877
I shall take my leave.

96
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,500
Why are you packing your things?

97
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,739
The hospital is afraid
I will get into more trouble.

98
00:05:35,739 --> 00:05:37,220
They want to keep this a secret too.

99
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,539
That's why they told me
to rest for a few days.

100
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,249
You're resting?

101
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:49,709
Mr Ren,

102
00:05:50,019 --> 00:05:51,939
I'll find you an excellent student.

103
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,259
Will people even join this?

104
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,393
(Ren Xin Zheng's TCM Apprentice Class)

105
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,860
There's something meaningful going on.

106
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:14,701
Do you want to hear me out?

107
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:15,756
What is it?

108
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,860
My father is holding
a TCM apprentice class.

109
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,539
Do you want to attend it?

110
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,740
Have you lost your mind?

111
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,580
Why should I learn TCM?

112
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,700
Do you think I haven't gotten
into enough trouble yet?

113
00:06:26,539 --> 00:06:27,659
Your so-called

114
00:06:27,659 --> 00:06:29,300
TCM practitioners don't even know
the molecular formulas.

115
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:30,980
They don't even understand what
not to do when patients take medicine

116
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,099
or the adverse effects of the medicine.

117
00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:33,939
They don't know the interaction
between different medicine too.

118
00:06:34,099 --> 00:06:36,420
Even so, they could make money
out of their inferior skills.

119
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:37,939
That's literally a quack doctor.

120
00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:40,860
This time, you should
try to prove them wrong.

121
00:06:41,099 --> 00:06:42,580
See if you can find evidence

122
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:45,059
that TCM is just
a false study of science.

123
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,379
Are you even your father's son?

124
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,339
Do you hold a grudge
against your father?

125
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,020
You want to land him in trouble.

126
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,659
But you want me to do it, huh?

127
00:07:03,659 --> 00:07:06,700
Use your spear to pierce
my father's shield.

128
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,659
Let's see

129
00:07:08,659 --> 00:07:09,900
who's better.

130
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:10,861
What do you think?

131
00:07:11,539 --> 00:07:12,432
Shi Yan?

132
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,300
You better don't regret it.

133
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,748
(Peng Shi Yan)

134
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:22,580
The court verdict is as such.

135
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,779
Attention.

136
00:07:26,499 --> 00:07:29,059
According to Article 113, 159,

137
00:07:29,219 --> 00:07:30,819
and 161

138
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,700
of Contract Law of

139
00:07:32,909 --> 00:07:34,700
the People's Republic of China,

140
00:07:34,939 --> 00:07:35,980
the court verdict is as such.

141
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,560
The defendant, Feng Zhuo,

142
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,468
should pay the plaintiff

143
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,499
a sum of 31.2 million yuan

144
00:07:41,779 --> 00:07:43,580
and the overdue interest as well.

145
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:45,779
If anyone is unsatisfied
with the final verdict,

146
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:48,499
you may submit your complaint

147
00:07:48,499 --> 00:07:49,700
to the court 15 days within

148
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,819
the delivery of the verdict.

149
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:00,140
The top lawyer of Jiangzhou

150
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,259
does live up to her name indeed.

151
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,580
Mr Kong, you flatter me.

152
00:08:05,539 --> 00:08:06,455
See you around.

153
00:08:07,539 --> 00:08:08,779
I think it's better

154
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,379
if we never see each other again.

155
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,499
-Someone fainted!
-What's wrong?

156
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,099
Someone fainted!

157
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:23,939
Mr Kong, are you okay? Mr Kong.

158
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:24,823
Mr Kong!

159
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:27,819
I'm afraid he had a heart attack.

160
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:29,264
Call the ambulance!

161
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,980
-Call the ambulance!
-Call 120!

162
00:08:31,099 --> 00:08:31,932
Hurry and call 120!

163
00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:39,740
Let me put it this way.

164
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:40,779
If I do attend the apprentice class,

165
00:08:40,819 --> 00:08:42,259
your father can leave the class.

166
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,620
That's why I invited you.

167
00:08:44,819 --> 00:08:45,662
What were you guys talking about?

168
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:47,020
-That sounded fun.
-Quan.

169
00:08:47,219 --> 00:08:48,539
Quan, what are you doing here?

170
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,620
I heard you two from far away.

171
00:08:51,659 --> 00:08:52,480
You travel everywhere, huh?

172
00:08:52,539 --> 00:08:53,819
Speak for yourself.

173
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,539
I thought you were working at
the TCM affiliated hospital yesterday?

174
00:08:55,539 --> 00:08:56,740
What are you doing
in a Western hospital today?

175
00:08:57,325 --> 00:08:58,194
Don't bring it up.

176
00:08:58,219 --> 00:09:00,700
Last night, they sent me
a rejection letter.

177
00:09:01,099 --> 00:09:02,819
I came to visit
the rehabilitation department.

178
00:09:02,819 --> 00:09:03,939
They said they were hiring
acupuncturists.

179
00:09:04,099 --> 00:09:05,099
I came here to try my luck.

180
00:09:05,099 --> 00:09:06,539
I told him long ago.

181
00:09:06,539 --> 00:09:07,379
But you don't believe me.

182
00:09:07,539 --> 00:09:08,819
Just go to my grandfather's
medical centre.

183
00:09:08,819 --> 00:09:09,819
I'm sure you'll get in
without any issues.

184
00:09:09,939 --> 00:09:10,819
That won't do.

185
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,219
My parents said

186
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,539
I have to get an established position.

187
00:09:14,819 --> 00:09:15,939
Only then, I can stay in Jiangzhou.

188
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,700
Once I have gained a firm foothold here,
I can bring my younger brother here.

189
00:09:17,939 --> 00:09:18,818
When I earn money,

190
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:19,700
I have to bring my parents

191
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,779
and my relatives here.

192
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,819
Quan, it's tough on you indeed.

193
00:09:24,219 --> 00:09:26,939
You got into college for the sake
of your whole village.

194
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,622
Here, take these fruits and milk.

195
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,560
Take them back.

196
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,474
They're my compensation.

197
00:09:31,539 --> 00:09:33,860
Yeah. Dr Peng won them after a battle.

198
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,099
Why are you still standing there?

199
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,178
It's my compensation.

200
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:37,194
Just take them.

201
00:09:38,659 --> 00:09:39,740
I won't stand on ceremony then.

202
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,667
Hurry up.

203
00:09:43,468 --> 00:09:44,401
By the way, Tian Zhen,

204
00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:45,779
have you made up your mind?

205
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,460
Will you do your Ph.D. at college

206
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,499
or the hospital?

207
00:09:49,099 --> 00:09:50,099
I'm not in a hurry.

208
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:51,620
You're not in a hurry?

209
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:52,860
Shi Yan, you hear that?

210
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,361
He's not in a hurry.

211
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:56,187
Tian Zhen's starting point
is my end point.

212
00:09:56,779 --> 00:09:57,740
This time, you're wrong.

213
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,900
I'm not pursuing my study in a college

214
00:09:58,900 --> 00:09:59,700
or a hospital.

215
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,620
My father is holding
a TCM apprentice class.

216
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,819
I'll study there.

217
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,020
Mr Wu has agreed to it.

218
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,539
Apprentice class?

219
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,260
Can I attend it too?

220
00:10:38,659 --> 00:10:39,490
See you around.

221
00:10:40,659 --> 00:10:41,779
I think it's better

222
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,380
if we never see each other again.

223
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,860
Look at all these food delivery riders.

224
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,539
Can I register for this?

225
00:11:21,539 --> 00:11:23,180
Do you even know what this is?

226
00:11:24,099 --> 00:11:25,031
I do.

227
00:11:26,659 --> 00:11:27,620
Do you know him?

228
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,100
(Ren Xin Zheng's TCM Apprentice Class)

229
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,180
To be a student of TCM,

230
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,659
I think we must be learning

231
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:34,880
to save lives, right?

232
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,406
Yeah.

233
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,633
Okay.

234
00:11:42,659 --> 00:11:44,620
This should be
the best option for me now.

235
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,040
I'll register for it right now.

236
00:11:51,193 --> 00:11:53,760
(Yang Xiao Hong)

237
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:06,703
Hello, Mum?

238
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:07,862
Quan.

239
00:12:08,659 --> 00:12:09,800
Listen.

240
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:12,459
Just now, the village chief
and village secretary

241
00:12:12,459 --> 00:12:13,860
visited us.

242
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,339
They were praising you.

243
00:12:16,339 --> 00:12:17,699
They said you made us proud.

244
00:12:18,659 --> 00:12:19,820
(You have the highest
academic qualification)

245
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,339
(in our village.)

246
00:12:21,659 --> 00:12:22,659
(Hubby,)

247
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:23,568
(come here.)

248
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:25,579
Talk to your son. Come on.

249
00:12:26,099 --> 00:12:27,219
Once you get to work

250
00:12:27,219 --> 00:12:28,180
and start earning money,

251
00:12:28,659 --> 00:12:30,139
remember to give us some of it.

252
00:12:30,139 --> 00:12:30,980
(Don't forget.)

253
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,300
(You still have a younger brother
who'll attend school soon.)

254
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,420
(We can't afford to support him.)

255
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,380
Dad, I got it.

256
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:38,339
By the way, Dad,

257
00:12:38,779 --> 00:12:41,539
our principal will be holding
an advanced course.

258
00:12:41,539 --> 00:12:42,699
He has invited a lot of experts
to join his course.

259
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:45,180
(I wish to join it.)

260
00:12:45,219 --> 00:12:46,036
What?

261
00:12:46,107 --> 00:12:47,107
Advanced course?

262
00:12:47,539 --> 00:12:48,779
(I thought you already graduated?)

263
00:12:49,099 --> 00:12:50,139
(Why are you still studying?)

264
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,300
(Did you not get a job?)

265
00:12:53,659 --> 00:12:54,980
I got one.

266
00:12:55,539 --> 00:12:56,420
The principal...

267
00:12:57,099 --> 00:12:58,339
The principal helped me to get one.

268
00:13:00,099 --> 00:13:02,099
Don't worry. I'll have a bright future
if I work under him.

269
00:13:03,219 --> 00:13:04,620
I know now!

270
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,779
You mean
the Grade A tertiary hospital, right?

271
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:09,260
(Remember to work hard then.)

272
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,459
(Strive to make our village,)

273
00:13:10,779 --> 00:13:11,779
(our community,)

274
00:13:11,779 --> 00:13:12,860
and our district

275
00:13:13,099 --> 00:13:14,060
proud,

276
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,219
you hear me?

277
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:16,980
Okay.

278
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:17,888
I...

279
00:13:18,099 --> 00:13:19,219
My superior is looking for me.

280
00:13:19,219 --> 00:13:20,300
Mum, I need to go.

281
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,500
(From Jiangzhou City No.1 Hospital.)

282
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,600
(Mr Zhao Li Quan,
thanks for coming to the interview.)

283
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,071
(We regret to inform you that you're
rejected. All the best in the future.)

284
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,219
You want to join it

285
00:13:36,219 --> 00:13:37,123
when you don't know what it's for?

286
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,099
My sense is tingling.

287
00:13:39,099 --> 00:13:40,459
I'm sure you won't make
the wrong decision.

288
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:42,860
Think about it. You're not
attending college

289
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:43,779
or joining the hospital for this.

290
00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:45,820
That means both of those options
must be inferior to your current one.

291
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:48,539
Tell your father about it, okay?

292
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:49,699
Let me join it too.

293
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,060
Welcome, Zhao.

294
00:14:00,659 --> 00:14:01,564
You're going too?

295
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:03,883
Welcome.

296
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,040
(The willow is green,)

297
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,555
(the orioles fly, the grass grows,)

298
00:14:14,147 --> 00:14:15,101
(the wheat sprouts,)

299
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:17,468
(and the canola flowers smell good.)

300
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,920
(Chunfen (The middle of spring))

301
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,219
We're here to work as labourers.

302
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,219
Mr Ren does

303
00:14:30,539 --> 00:14:31,899
utilize us to the fullest, huh?

304
00:14:36,539 --> 00:14:37,420
Here you go.

305
00:14:41,219 --> 00:14:42,740
The first in Jiangzhou?

306
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,539
They're making it as if
they're going to hold this again

307
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:46,740
and spread it across the country.

308
00:14:46,899 --> 00:14:48,019
That won't do.

309
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:49,740
We need to spread it
throughout the world.

310
00:14:50,659 --> 00:14:52,180
Throughout the world?

311
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:54,860
Do you guys know that Western medicine
is the main treatment for the world?

312
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,019
Do you guys know that
we're able to extend our lifespan

313
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,420
due to the invention of Penicillin?

314
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,219
We have never denied

315
00:15:00,219 --> 00:15:01,699
the contribution of Western medicine
to the world.

316
00:15:01,699 --> 00:15:03,219
You guys are the ones
who keep denying TCM.

317
00:15:04,099 --> 00:15:05,010
Fine.

318
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,180
Tell me then.

319
00:15:06,699 --> 00:15:07,616
Give me a reason

320
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,620
not to deny TCM.

321
00:15:09,099 --> 00:15:10,060
Give me a hand.

322
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,743
Shi Yan, check the height for us.

323
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:16,659
Stand properly then.

324
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:20,495
Tian Zhen,

325
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,779
raise it slightly.

326
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,826
Quan,

327
00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:30,699
make it looser. That's right.

328
00:15:34,764 --> 00:15:35,630
Okay.

329
00:15:35,659 --> 00:15:36,539
You can hold it in place.

330
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,980
A goddess has appeared in this hellhole.

331
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:56,459
Liu Chang Qing is a scammer.

332
00:15:57,099 --> 00:15:58,219
I guess he gave us this piece of land

333
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,579
so that

334
00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:01,339
we could help him reclaim it.

335
00:16:02,019 --> 00:16:03,099
There's nothing here.

336
00:16:03,099 --> 00:16:04,060
And everything is broken.

337
00:16:04,659 --> 00:16:06,060
In the future, if he wants you
to do acupuncture on him,

338
00:16:06,219 --> 00:16:07,539
do it where it hurts.

339
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:11,019
Let's stop being picky.

340
00:16:12,579 --> 00:16:14,019
We have a good place here.

341
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,940
It's a great start.

342
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,899
Look at this lousy window.

343
00:16:17,899 --> 00:16:18,980
I can't even close it.

344
00:16:20,099 --> 00:16:20,980
Come.

345
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,300
Just leave it open then.

346
00:16:29,539 --> 00:16:30,420
Leave it open?

347
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,019
You...

348
00:16:33,019 --> 00:16:34,099
Where's Tou Tou?

349
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,219
I thought she was grabbing a cloth?

350
00:16:36,219 --> 00:16:37,420
Why isn't she back yet?

351
00:16:38,099 --> 00:16:38,976
Tou Tou,

352
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,219
I thought you were bringing us a cloth?

353
00:16:41,219 --> 00:16:42,420
The water supply stopped.

354
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,060
I went to turn on the main switch.

355
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,980
The water is yellow.

356
00:16:47,099 --> 00:16:48,620
-Is that so?
-Wait.

357
00:16:48,956 --> 00:16:49,820
Why don't you

358
00:16:50,019 --> 00:16:51,300
tell Liu Chang Qing

359
00:16:51,339 --> 00:16:52,219
to hire someone

360
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:54,459
to fix the doors and windows first?

361
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:56,180
If not,

362
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,500
the wind will get in constantly.

363
00:16:57,579 --> 00:16:59,060
Our bodies can't take it.

364
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:02,820
We should be grateful
that he's allowing us

365
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,180
to use this place for free.

366
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,339
Maybe he'll give us

367
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:07,339
what you want

368
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:08,300
after some time.

369
00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:11,019
What I want?

370
00:17:11,019 --> 00:17:12,300
More like what you want.

371
00:17:12,539 --> 00:17:13,980
I'm not as lucky as you.

372
00:17:14,219 --> 00:17:16,260
You always attract the things you want

373
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,779
to you.

374
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,850
But me?

375
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,079
Whenever I want something,

376
00:17:20,219 --> 00:17:22,500
I need to work for it.

377
00:17:22,539 --> 00:17:24,219
Why are you reading these?

378
00:17:24,219 --> 00:17:25,139
It's full of dust.

379
00:17:26,219 --> 00:17:27,579
When the students are here,

380
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:29,219
we'll use the first period
to clean the place up.

381
00:17:29,779 --> 00:17:31,099
When it's dawn,

382
00:17:31,459 --> 00:17:32,620
everything will be clean.

383
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:33,980
Both the exterior and interior
will be clean.

384
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,539
We'll clean the paths too.

385
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:36,910
Okay?

386
00:17:37,219 --> 00:17:38,133
I was wondering.

387
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,314
This...

388
00:17:39,339 --> 00:17:42,659
-I thought I was lucky enough
-Be careful.

389
00:17:42,659 --> 00:17:43,699
to get into something nice.

390
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:44,901
I was wondering

391
00:17:45,219 --> 00:17:46,899
why you took me as your successor.

392
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:47,860
Now I know.

393
00:17:47,899 --> 00:17:48,779
Being a successor

394
00:17:49,659 --> 00:17:50,899
is worse than being a janitor.

395
00:17:51,219 --> 00:17:53,380
You told me to come
so that I could clean the place for you.

396
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,579
Isn't it good to do cleaning duties?

397
00:17:56,659 --> 00:17:58,659
If the worldly air is clean,

398
00:17:59,539 --> 00:18:00,539
our spirits will be calmed.

399
00:18:00,659 --> 00:18:01,740
Enough already.

400
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,940
A smooth flow will produce
constant qi of yang.

401
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,300
Even if there is illness,

402
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,180
one shall not be harmed.

403
00:18:11,099 --> 00:18:11,940
What does that mean?

404
00:18:12,899 --> 00:18:14,219
That's part of Questions of
Organic and Fundamental Nature.

405
00:18:14,899 --> 00:18:15,940
That means

406
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:19,019
if you clean both
the interior and exterior,

407
00:18:19,019 --> 00:18:20,659
you can be just like me,

408
00:18:20,659 --> 00:18:22,339
you can ascend

409
00:18:22,659 --> 00:18:23,570
to the heavens,

410
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,320
burrow underground.

411
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,219
You can do whatever you want to do

412
00:18:30,219 --> 00:18:32,300
and meet whoever you want to meet.

413
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,659
You must be kidding me.

414
00:18:34,699 --> 00:18:36,180
There's no way that can happen.

415
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,820
You think you can do a backflip

416
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,299
and reach another mountain
like what we see in the cartoons?

417
00:18:39,579 --> 00:18:40,819
I can't do backflips.

418
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:42,500
But I can achieve

419
00:18:43,299 --> 00:18:44,219
my dream without any issues.

420
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,320
Look.

421
00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:47,699
I just need to think of it.

422
00:18:49,939 --> 00:18:50,756
Done.

423
00:18:52,579 --> 00:18:53,448
Really?

424
00:18:55,179 --> 00:18:56,059
Of course.

425
00:19:03,579 --> 00:19:05,419
Please let the banks transfer
all their money to me.

426
00:19:11,059 --> 00:19:12,500
Money means nothing.

427
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,140
When you become truly capable,

428
00:19:14,299 --> 00:19:15,579
you won't care about money by then.

429
00:19:16,067 --> 00:19:17,040
Tell me then.

430
00:19:17,179 --> 00:19:18,459
What's better than money?

431
00:19:18,459 --> 00:19:19,380
Plenty of things are better than money.

432
00:19:19,699 --> 00:19:21,860
Money is just a lowly pleasure
that people seek.

433
00:19:22,339 --> 00:19:23,500
When you're truly capable,

434
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,540
money means nothing.

435
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,179
You're wrong.

436
00:19:28,419 --> 00:19:30,219
You can't do anything without money.

437
00:19:30,219 --> 00:19:31,579
If you had money,

438
00:19:31,579 --> 00:19:32,900
you would've built a school

439
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,459
in the middle of the city.

440
00:19:34,459 --> 00:19:35,660
If you had money,

441
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,819
you would hold your meetings

442
00:19:36,819 --> 00:19:38,020
in the best office you could find.

443
00:19:38,059 --> 00:19:38,939
Look at you.

444
00:19:38,939 --> 00:19:39,740
You're penniless, right?

445
00:19:40,219 --> 00:19:41,740
That's why you have

446
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,900
to do all these stupid things.

447
00:19:47,299 --> 00:19:48,699
Tou Tou, be careful.

448
00:19:48,699 --> 00:19:49,939
Be careful not to fall.

449
00:19:50,299 --> 00:19:51,186
Tou Tou,

450
00:19:52,579 --> 00:19:55,179
you should wear another
cotton pants tomorrow.

451
00:19:55,579 --> 00:19:57,579
It's so cold. You shouldn't
let your ankle be exposed.

452
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:58,900
Mr Ren.

453
00:20:00,579 --> 00:20:01,819
I checked the bed

454
00:20:01,819 --> 00:20:02,939
that we'll be sleeping on.

455
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:04,459
The mattress is too thin.

456
00:20:04,459 --> 00:20:05,660
It's tough to sleep on it.

457
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,939
I'm afraid Tian Zhen will not
be able to get used to it.

458
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:09,179
Why don't you let him
stay at home tonight?

459
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:10,219
He's not that delicate.

460
00:20:10,579 --> 00:20:11,524
It's not that tough.

461
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:31,540
I was wondering who it was.

462
00:20:32,579 --> 00:20:33,660
From now on, we'll be dormmates.

463
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:34,579
We're staying together.

464
00:20:34,579 --> 00:20:35,939
I'll bring your stuff inside.
What's wrong?

465
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:38,620
Guys, come and register your name first.

466
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:41,740
Please write your name here.

467
00:20:42,323 --> 00:20:43,243
This is my name.

468
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:46,299
I mean your genuine name.

469
00:20:46,299 --> 00:20:47,459
Not your nickname.

470
00:20:47,699 --> 00:20:49,419
You need our genuine names here?

471
00:20:49,939 --> 00:20:51,540
Do you need to check our household
registers and our ID cards too?

472
00:20:51,619 --> 00:20:52,555
What about this?

473
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,980
Show me your teaching
qualifications first.

474
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:54,855
I need to check it.

475
00:20:55,299 --> 00:20:57,419
So, our superior is here
to monitor us, huh?

476
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,419
Are you a TCM paediatrician?

477
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:06,699
I'm a Master of Medicine.

478
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,834
Western Medicine.

479
00:21:08,939 --> 00:21:09,939
Master, you know?

480
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:21,380
Doctor?

481
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,372
Tian Zhen,

482
00:21:22,459 --> 00:21:24,179
I think we need to check
their household registers.

483
00:21:24,459 --> 00:21:25,939
If not, they can come up
with all kinds of funny titles.

484
00:21:39,819 --> 00:21:41,620
Doctor, understand?

485
00:21:43,939 --> 00:21:45,660
Not only

486
00:21:46,699 --> 00:21:47,579
are you guys holding

487
00:21:47,579 --> 00:21:48,980
the apprentice class
at such a remote place,

488
00:21:49,459 --> 00:21:51,699
but you guys also don't serve us
any tea during tea break.

489
00:21:53,179 --> 00:21:54,059
What?

490
00:21:55,059 --> 00:21:55,900
Tea break?

491
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,179
What's a tea break?

492
00:22:03,219 --> 00:22:04,517
-Is she done?
-No.

493
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:07,179
Ms Rebecca,

494
00:22:07,579 --> 00:22:08,900
you won't get to try

495
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:10,780
this 1982 Chinese tea elsewhere.

496
00:22:16,419 --> 00:22:17,294
Your name is

497
00:22:17,579 --> 00:22:18,419
Roubecca?

498
00:22:20,579 --> 00:22:22,260
It's my first time seeing someone
with the surname Rou.

499
00:22:28,699 --> 00:22:30,339
Stop pulling a long face.

500
00:22:30,579 --> 00:22:32,299
Smile. Try to be happy.

501
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:33,309
Don't you think so?

502
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,101
Tian Zhen,

503
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:43,137
sit here.

504
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:54,895
Tou Tou.

505
00:22:59,339 --> 00:23:00,291
Okay.

506
00:23:14,419 --> 00:23:15,345
Tou Tou.

507
00:23:17,587 --> 00:23:18,434
My dear!

508
00:23:18,459 --> 00:23:19,540
My dear?

509
00:23:20,059 --> 00:23:20,980
Who are you?

510
00:23:22,099 --> 00:23:23,059
I'm her roommate.

511
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,320
She's my dear alright.

512
00:23:24,339 --> 00:23:25,179
And that's none of your business.

513
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:28,260
Why are you here?

514
00:23:28,339 --> 00:23:29,219
It's like this.

515
00:23:29,299 --> 00:23:30,819
I'm very interested in TCM.

516
00:23:30,819 --> 00:23:33,099
That's why I'm here to sit in
on the course.

517
00:23:33,939 --> 00:23:34,819
She's here to learn.

518
00:23:35,099 --> 00:23:35,980
Not everyone

519
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:38,339
can attend our apprentice class.

520
00:23:38,339 --> 00:23:39,260
I'm a nurse.

521
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:40,900
It's hard for me to
finally get a day off.

522
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,579
Please just let me attend it this time.

523
00:23:44,179 --> 00:23:45,179
Which hospital are you from?

524
00:23:45,699 --> 00:23:46,939
People's Hospital, the ER department.

525
00:23:49,099 --> 00:23:49,900
You may sit.

526
00:23:49,939 --> 00:23:50,939
I knew it. Come.

527
00:23:50,939 --> 00:23:51,862
Let's sit together.

528
00:23:52,579 --> 00:23:53,450
Why were you looking for me?

529
00:23:53,579 --> 00:23:54,474
Alright, my students.

530
00:23:56,299 --> 00:23:57,299
Our TCM apprentice class

531
00:23:57,819 --> 00:23:59,939
will officially begin today.

532
00:24:00,099 --> 00:24:01,299
From today onward,

533
00:24:02,179 --> 00:24:05,179
we're fellow learners
of the ways of TCM.

534
00:24:06,091 --> 00:24:06,972
Tell me.

535
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,800
-Where's the hunk?
-Guys, please follow me.

536
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,680
The first guy who's sitting
beside the window.

537
00:24:12,339 --> 00:24:13,419
Let us bow to our predecessors,

538
00:24:13,868 --> 00:24:14,734
the Yellow Emperor

539
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:16,107
and Confucius.

540
00:24:17,725 --> 00:24:18,729
Is he good-looking?

541
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,825
Not bad.

542
00:24:19,939 --> 00:24:21,179
He's pretty cool.

543
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,506
He's my cup of tea.

544
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:23,980
Zhang Zhongjing.

545
00:24:28,059 --> 00:24:28,987
Let's bow to them thrice.

546
00:24:29,819 --> 00:24:30,980
Guys, please stand up.

547
00:24:31,339 --> 00:24:32,579
Did he say the emperor?

548
00:24:32,579 --> 00:24:33,556
-Get up!
-Wait.

549
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,459
The Qing empire was eradicated long ago.

550
00:24:36,459 --> 00:24:37,299
Why are we bowing to an emperor?

551
00:24:55,179 --> 00:24:56,191
You may sit.

552
00:25:01,579 --> 00:25:02,699
This book

553
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,540
is called Virtue of A Great Physician.

554
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:06,819
Let's read it together

555
00:25:07,299 --> 00:25:09,459
before we begin our class.

556
00:25:09,819 --> 00:25:10,980
Virtue of A Great Physician.

557
00:25:11,579 --> 00:25:12,939
Virtue of A Great Physician.

558
00:25:13,699 --> 00:25:16,099
By Sun Simiao of Tang.

559
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:18,740
Zhang Zhan said,

560
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:21,179
“The reason why the methods in
the classics are so difficult to grasp

561
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,620
in their essence is that they come
from such a lofty origin.”

562
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,320
Nowadays, there are diseases
that are identical on the inside

563
00:25:24,384 --> 00:25:25,680
but different on the outside,

564
00:25:25,939 --> 00:25:27,160
as well as diseases
that are different on the inside

565
00:25:27,219 --> 00:25:28,400
but identical on the outside.

566
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:31,299
Therefore, abundance or emptiness in
the five yin organs and six yang organs

567
00:25:31,819 --> 00:25:34,219
and the free flow or
blockage of qi and blood

568
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:36,900
is certainly not something that
can be observed by only eyes and ears.

569
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,900
They must first be examined
by diagnosing signs.

570
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,579
There are floating and sinking,

571
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,780
relaxed and tight pulses...

572
00:25:45,299 --> 00:25:47,260
Stop dragging me.
I need to find your principal!

573
00:25:47,419 --> 00:25:48,419
It's alright.

574
00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:49,819
Mr Ren, I need to tell you something.

575
00:25:50,099 --> 00:25:51,019
Wait.

576
00:25:51,219 --> 00:25:52,459
I'm not Mr Ren.

577
00:25:52,459 --> 00:25:54,020
Mr Ren had already resigned.

578
00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:55,699
I'm the new principal.

579
00:25:55,699 --> 00:25:56,699
Do you need something from him?

580
00:25:56,699 --> 00:25:57,579
He resigned?

581
00:25:57,939 --> 00:25:58,838
That's impossible.

582
00:25:58,939 --> 00:26:00,459
I thought he was still holding classes?

583
00:26:01,099 --> 00:26:02,620
He did hold an apprentice class.

584
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,660
However, it's not here.

585
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:04,659
Where is it then?

586
00:26:05,459 --> 00:26:06,419
Calm down.

587
00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:08,579
Tell me what's the issue first.

588
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,419
You won't understand.
I need to speak with him.

589
00:26:10,699 --> 00:26:11,660
Come back.

590
00:26:11,821 --> 00:26:12,980
Do you know where he is?

591
00:26:13,579 --> 00:26:14,980
Where is he?

592
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,059
Tell me first.

593
00:26:16,299 --> 00:26:17,299
Why exactly

594
00:26:17,819 --> 00:26:18,660
are you looking for him?

595
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:21,579
There's a murderer

596
00:26:22,819 --> 00:26:24,540
in his class!

597
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:28,900
When it comes to studying,
we need to follow the right ways

598
00:26:29,459 --> 00:26:30,459
and start at a high point.

599
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:31,939
We read

600
00:26:31,939 --> 00:26:33,540
Virtue of A Great Physician

601
00:26:33,699 --> 00:26:35,140
before our class just now.

602
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:36,883
In the future,

603
00:26:37,459 --> 00:26:40,099
we must read it before
we start our classes.

604
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:41,459
This way, the book itself

605
00:26:41,819 --> 00:26:43,780
will be integrated into
our blood and soul

606
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,939
after four years.

607
00:26:46,099 --> 00:26:47,129
We shall strive

608
00:26:47,579 --> 00:26:51,059
to become the modern
Sun Simiao and Zhang Zhongjing.

609
00:26:51,699 --> 00:26:52,900
I don't know who they are.

610
00:26:53,299 --> 00:26:54,339
How can I become them?

611
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,459
You'll know them eventually.

612
00:26:59,099 --> 00:27:01,059
When we aim high, we achieve mediocrity.

613
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:04,179
When we aim for mediocrity,
we achieve nothing.

614
00:27:05,579 --> 00:27:06,699
We need

615
00:27:06,819 --> 00:27:08,140
-Keep it away.
-to have lofty ambitions.

616
00:27:08,339 --> 00:27:11,140
Even if we can't reach the standards
of Zhang Zhongjing,

617
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,028
at least

618
00:27:12,203 --> 00:27:13,028
we'll be someone

619
00:27:13,819 --> 00:27:14,900
who strive for more than
just basic necessities.

620
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:19,758
What's your question?

621
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:22,059
I beg to differ.

622
00:27:23,179 --> 00:27:24,099
I think striving for basic necessities

623
00:27:24,099 --> 00:27:25,380
is noble enough nowadays.

624
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:28,579
If so, are you the same
as a boar in a forest

625
00:27:28,819 --> 00:27:31,620
or a jackal in the plains?

626
00:27:32,339 --> 00:27:33,500
Of course I'm different.

627
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,059
We can't just strive for
basic necessities.

628
00:27:35,059 --> 00:27:36,579
We must understand

629
00:27:36,579 --> 00:27:38,579
the true meaning behind our existence.

630
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:46,459
The word "Ming"

631
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:49,219
is very advanced.

632
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:50,819
Once you understand
the meaning of your existence,

633
00:27:51,459 --> 00:27:52,780
you will hold the Sun and Moon
in your heart.

634
00:27:53,179 --> 00:27:54,059
You'll glow splendidly.

635
00:27:54,819 --> 00:27:55,660
My wish

636
00:27:55,819 --> 00:27:57,179
is to become one who is enlightened

637
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:59,459
together with you all.

638
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,672
If,

639
00:28:01,059 --> 00:28:03,059
one of you guys

640
00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:06,579
do end up becoming the modern Confucius
or Zhang Zhongjing,

641
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,900
I'll be honoured.

642
00:28:11,579 --> 00:28:12,419
What are you laughing at?

643
00:28:15,219 --> 00:28:16,540
I was reminded of a story.

644
00:28:16,579 --> 00:28:17,579
Is there something funny?

645
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,299
To educate people

646
00:28:24,179 --> 00:28:25,419
is my dream.

647
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,179
I don't expect

648
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:28,500
to get anything from you all.

649
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:29,939
This is my only wish.

650
00:28:30,939 --> 00:28:32,059
No matter

651
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:34,099
for what reason you come,

652
00:28:34,459 --> 00:28:35,299
and what identity you possess,

653
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:36,699
I hope that you guys

654
00:28:37,099 --> 00:28:39,140
must cherish your time here.

655
00:28:40,339 --> 00:28:42,099
I hope you can do something

656
00:28:42,579 --> 00:28:43,780
when you see a patient

657
00:28:43,996 --> 00:28:45,156
or are in an emergency.

658
00:28:45,339 --> 00:28:46,939
I don't want you guys to regret it

659
00:28:46,939 --> 00:28:50,860
when you don't learn something useful
here that you could use out there.

660
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,720
Master, if, one day,

661
00:28:56,459 --> 00:28:58,299
one of your disciples

662
00:28:58,939 --> 00:28:59,841
has become the modern Confucius

663
00:29:00,579 --> 00:29:01,557
or Zhang Zhongjing,

664
00:29:01,939 --> 00:29:03,299
can you tell him

665
00:29:03,299 --> 00:29:05,780
that we're in the same sect?

666
00:29:11,459 --> 00:29:13,819
Although this is an apprentice class,

667
00:29:14,099 --> 00:29:15,339
I still hope

668
00:29:16,299 --> 00:29:17,620
that you guys can call me your teacher.

669
00:29:17,939 --> 00:29:19,099
I shall call you all my students.

670
00:29:19,579 --> 00:29:20,500
Don't call me your master.

671
00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:22,166
Understood.

672
00:29:23,316 --> 00:29:24,271
What did you understand?

673
00:29:27,339 --> 00:29:29,099
Master, we definitely won't tell
others that you're our master

674
00:29:29,459 --> 00:29:30,980
when we get into trouble.

675
00:29:33,579 --> 00:29:34,579
You guys understand?

676
00:29:46,939 --> 00:29:47,980
Alright, guys.

677
00:29:48,299 --> 00:29:50,179
This is our first lesson.

678
00:29:50,339 --> 00:29:51,620
We'll use the first period

679
00:29:51,819 --> 00:29:53,620
to clean up the courtyard

680
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:54,939
and make the road smoother.

681
00:29:55,099 --> 00:29:56,699
This way, we can

682
00:29:56,939 --> 00:29:59,459
travel in and out of the place smoothly.

683
00:29:59,819 --> 00:30:00,693
Alright. Class dismissed.

684
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,999
Xing Xing, stop.

685
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,232
I'll do it for you.

686
00:30:07,635 --> 00:30:08,955
Let me do it. You can rest.

687
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:09,866
Be careful.

688
00:30:24,068 --> 00:30:24,921
What?

689
00:30:25,668 --> 00:30:26,574
Get to work.

690
00:30:27,508 --> 00:30:28,409
No, I won't.

691
00:30:29,299 --> 00:30:30,540
I told you already.

692
00:30:31,099 --> 00:30:32,219
Just give me

693
00:30:32,219 --> 00:30:33,699
the money

694
00:30:33,699 --> 00:30:35,020
and I'll do your chores for you, okay?

695
00:30:35,179 --> 00:30:36,099
I don't need your help.

696
00:30:36,939 --> 00:30:38,380
Someone will volunteer to help me out.

697
00:30:40,059 --> 00:30:40,980
Who?

698
00:30:56,459 --> 00:30:57,699
Do you even know how to sweep the floor?

699
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,681
You'll only make it dirtier.

700
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:00,819
I don't know how to sweep the floor.

701
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:02,179
But I'm at least better than

702
00:31:02,339 --> 00:31:04,140
those who speak without doing anything.

703
00:31:05,059 --> 00:31:06,014
Watch out.

704
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:07,810
Go away.

705
00:31:10,732 --> 00:31:11,573
Stop talking.

706
00:31:11,819 --> 00:31:12,660
Get to work.

707
00:31:18,219 --> 00:31:19,059
Hey, brat.

708
00:31:31,059 --> 00:31:32,219
Why are you staring at me?

709
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,059
I'll gouge your eyes
if you keep staring.

710
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,819
You're still staring at me?

711
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:42,939
Did you think I was joking with you?

712
00:31:44,299 --> 00:31:45,221
You're still staring at me?

713
00:31:47,475 --> 00:31:48,414
You're still doing it?

714
00:31:52,227 --> 00:31:53,267
-I...
-Yang Xiao Hong!

715
00:31:53,339 --> 00:31:54,177
What are you doing?

716
00:31:54,299 --> 00:31:55,219
She's here to cause trouble!

717
00:31:55,939 --> 00:31:56,819
What are you doing?

718
00:31:56,819 --> 00:31:58,579
Yang Xiao Hong! You murderer!

719
00:31:58,579 --> 00:31:59,403
What's going on?

720
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:00,980
-Return my husband to me!
-Stop!

721
00:32:01,339 --> 00:32:02,262
Stop it!

722
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,620
My family is shattered because of you!

723
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:05,980
-Stop it!
-I'll make you pay!

724
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,020
What are you doing?

725
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:08,179
What's going on?

726
00:32:08,419 --> 00:32:10,059
You guys are fighting over chores now?

727
00:32:10,179 --> 00:32:10,980
What's going on?

728
00:32:11,485 --> 00:32:12,361
Wu Shan Dao,

729
00:32:12,939 --> 00:32:14,179
is this your work?

730
00:32:15,176 --> 00:32:16,459
Junior, you're blaming it
on the wrong person.

731
00:32:16,579 --> 00:32:18,099
-You guys, stop this!
-Tian Zhen!

732
00:32:18,099 --> 00:32:19,299
-Come here.
-It's like this.

733
00:32:19,579 --> 00:32:21,579
She went to the college to find Senior.

734
00:32:21,579 --> 00:32:22,939
I thought she was serious.

735
00:32:23,059 --> 00:32:25,419
Besides, I was afraid that
something bad might happen.

736
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:26,579
You guys, stop it!

737
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,299
That's why I brought her here.

738
00:32:28,459 --> 00:32:30,179
I never expected this to happen!

739
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:32,819
Stop fighting!

740
00:32:32,939 --> 00:32:33,829
Sun Tou Tou!

741
00:32:34,099 --> 00:32:35,780
I told you already!
Stop pulling my hair!

742
00:32:36,219 --> 00:32:37,260
All of you, stop right now!

743
00:32:40,339 --> 00:32:41,699
Are you guys done messing around?

744
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,380
Let's talk this over.

745
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,819
It's alright.

746
00:32:48,819 --> 00:32:50,059
What exactly is going on?

747
00:32:50,699 --> 00:32:51,594
It's her!

748
00:32:52,099 --> 00:32:52,992
That madam,

749
00:32:53,139 --> 00:32:54,419
she came and attacked
Roubecca straight away.

750
00:32:54,675 --> 00:32:55,555
I saw what she did.

751
00:32:56,699 --> 00:32:57,900
Let's talk this over.

752
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,339
The Mr Ren you're looking for
is over there.

753
00:33:00,579 --> 00:33:01,459
If you need anything

754
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:02,579
or need to look for someone,

755
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,819
just tell him.

756
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,179
Don't try to be violent.

757
00:33:06,939 --> 00:33:08,020
She's the person

758
00:33:08,299 --> 00:33:09,257
I'm looking for!

759
00:33:09,699 --> 00:33:11,059
You murderer!

760
00:33:16,299 --> 00:33:17,099
Madam,

761
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,980
I don't even know who you are.

762
00:33:20,219 --> 00:33:21,660
But I have to remind you of this.

763
00:33:22,059 --> 00:33:23,699
According to Clause 2 of Article 246

764
00:33:23,699 --> 00:33:26,099
of Criminal Law of
the People's Republic of China,

765
00:33:26,699 --> 00:33:29,020
whoever, by violence or other methods,

766
00:33:29,059 --> 00:33:30,900
publicly humiliates another person

767
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:31,900
or invents stories to defame him

768
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,699
will be convicted of slander!

769
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:35,939
You're the top lawyer
of Jiangzhou indeed.

770
00:33:36,339 --> 00:33:37,419
Ms Yang,

771
00:33:37,699 --> 00:33:39,140
you may not know me,

772
00:33:39,939 --> 00:33:41,939
but I'm sure you know this person.

773
00:33:42,579 --> 00:33:43,699
Kong Zhi Yuan!

774
00:33:52,579 --> 00:33:53,459
Mr Kong, the lawyer?

775
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,639
-You're his...
-I'm the wife

776
00:33:57,699 --> 00:33:59,819
of the man who died because of you!

777
00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:00,850
Enough.

778
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,219
Calm down.

779
00:34:10,459 --> 00:34:11,361
I'm sorry.

780
00:34:13,168 --> 00:34:15,020
I'm very sorry about
your husband's death.

781
00:34:17,579 --> 00:34:18,579
But I didn't cause his death.

782
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,179
You didn't?

783
00:34:20,299 --> 00:34:21,419
You murdered him!

784
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:22,699
You forced him to a dead end

785
00:34:22,699 --> 00:34:23,939
in order to win the lawsuit!

786
00:34:24,579 --> 00:34:26,459
You vicious woman!

787
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:28,099
Why didn't you save him?

788
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:30,579
Why did you just let him die

789
00:34:30,579 --> 00:34:31,980
in front of you?

790
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,699
Roubecca, say something.

791
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:39,459
Come on.

792
00:34:43,419 --> 00:34:44,819
I have nothing to say.

793
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:46,500
Are you sure?

794
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:49,219
You cold-blooded killer!

795
00:34:49,459 --> 00:34:50,980
You'll suffer a terrible fate!

796
00:34:51,939 --> 00:34:53,980
I'll haunt you as a ghost after I die!

797
00:34:54,299 --> 00:34:55,660
Return my husband to me!

798
00:34:55,699 --> 00:34:57,179
Return my husband to me!

799
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:00,699
You two can resolve your feud outside.

800
00:35:01,939 --> 00:35:03,179
I won't go out.

801
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:04,900
She has already lost her mind.

802
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,459
If I follow her outside,

803
00:35:06,459 --> 00:35:07,620
she'll kill me.

804
00:35:09,059 --> 00:35:09,900
She's right.

805
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,141
Call the cops.

806
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,020
Don't leave!

807
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:17,939
You're not allowed to leave!

808
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:36,897
It's hysteria.

809
00:35:37,339 --> 00:35:38,380
Get me my needle pack.

810
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:51,300
You must stop being emotional.

811
00:36:02,899 --> 00:36:05,419
Did you attack her vital point
or seal her movements?

812
00:36:05,459 --> 00:36:06,540
Why is she suddenly...

813
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,880
What happened just now?

814
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,500
Do you know that you're pregnant?

815
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,260
I'm pregnant?

816
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:15,419
Yes. However,

817
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,219
you're emotionally unstable.

818
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:21,899
You have a weak pulse.

819
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:24,179
It's hard to say
if you can keep the baby or not.

820
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,459
Send her to the hospital then.

821
00:36:25,716 --> 00:36:26,671
We have to.

822
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,840
-My car is over there.
-Okay.

823
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,580
I need to head to the city too.
I'll go together with them.

824
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,453
Okay.

825
00:36:31,659 --> 00:36:32,939
Come.

826
00:36:42,179 --> 00:36:43,060
Clean this place up.

827
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,219
We still need to attend class later.

828
00:36:48,179 --> 00:36:49,052
Don't worry.

829
00:36:49,219 --> 00:36:51,120
Dr Song is the 15th generation
of a famous family of doctors

830
00:36:51,152 --> 00:36:52,309
who specialises in
obstetrics and paediatrics.

831
00:36:52,419 --> 00:36:54,500
She'll definitely send you
to the hospital safely.

832
00:36:54,939 --> 00:36:55,884
You'll be fine.

833
00:37:11,419 --> 00:37:12,899
Did you kill her husband?

834
00:37:13,939 --> 00:37:15,020
Didn't you hear her?

835
00:37:15,179 --> 00:37:16,100
She said

836
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:18,740
that she caused her husband
to have a heart attack

837
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,419
with her silver tongue.

838
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,300
You're good at sweeping the floor,

839
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,219
but you're not eloquent at all.

840
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:25,419
You should stop provoking her.

841
00:37:25,419 --> 00:37:27,659
If not, you'll get a heart attack too,

842
00:37:27,659 --> 00:37:28,530
got it?

843
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:38,740
She's not breathing!

844
00:37:39,459 --> 00:37:41,260
Nurse, come and examine her!

845
00:37:53,899 --> 00:37:54,740
Get back to class.

846
00:37:58,780 --> 00:37:59,580
Let's go.

847
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:01,939
You fools.

848
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,080
Roubecca, time for class.

849
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,103
Wait.

850
00:38:24,244 --> 00:38:25,114
Stop acting.

851
00:38:25,139 --> 00:38:26,778
They're already gone.

852
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:32,820
I guess I'll go first.

853
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,154
Rebecca?

854
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,418
Rebecca?

855
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,507
Everyone, don't gather around.

856
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,520
Give her some breathing space.

857
00:38:45,459 --> 00:38:46,444
Roubecca.

858
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,422
She's down for real?

859
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,301
Roubecca!

860
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:55,813
Roubecca?

861
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:02,765
She's alive.

862
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,690
She's back.

863
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,780
-I'll get the needles.
-They're over there!

864
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:08,939
Over here.

865
00:39:33,699 --> 00:39:34,740
I didn't.

866
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:38,100
I didn't murder him.

867
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:40,300
The person who wants to hear that
from you has already left.

868
00:39:41,179 --> 00:39:42,060
Roubecca,

869
00:39:42,699 --> 00:39:44,260
you're truly impressive.

870
00:39:44,459 --> 00:39:46,179
You actually fell unconscious
only after your opponent left.

871
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,219
You're amazing.

872
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,619
Why is my shirt torn?

873
00:39:54,419 --> 00:39:55,659
Did you do it?

874
00:39:56,459 --> 00:39:57,419
I did it.

875
00:39:57,419 --> 00:39:58,780
It was an emergency.
That's why I cut it.

876
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:01,260
Do you know how much this costs?

877
00:40:01,939 --> 00:40:03,100
It's Loro Piana, you know?

878
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:03,939
It's pure cashmere.

879
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,179
It costs 23,800 yuan.

880
00:40:05,179 --> 00:40:06,300
You cut it just like that?

881
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:08,780
Is your life worth
less than 23,800 yuan?

882
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:10,740
I wasn't saved by Western medicine
practitioners like you all.

883
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,540
Mr Ren saved me

884
00:40:12,939 --> 00:40:14,459
with acupuncture.

885
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:17,540
You're such an ingrate.

886
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,699
Xing Xing was trying to you, you know?

887
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:20,260
How could you talk to her like that?

888
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:21,899
Fine then, famous lawyer.

889
00:40:21,899 --> 00:40:22,817
You can sue us if you like.

890
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:30,379
You wouldn't even get the chance

891
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:31,939
to wait for the ambulance to arrive
if Professor Ren wasn't here.

892
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:33,780
You can have the clip.

893
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:34,719
You don't need to give it back.

894
00:40:35,619 --> 00:40:36,500
This doesn't make sense.

895
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:38,340
This doesn't make sense at all.

896
00:40:38,619 --> 00:40:40,020
I think she's sick in the head too.

897
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:41,899
I was referring to what he did just now.

898
00:40:41,899 --> 00:40:42,820
He saved her with needles.

899
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:44,219
That doesn't make sense.

900
00:40:44,899 --> 00:40:47,020
It's because you don't understand
how it works.

901
00:40:51,652 --> 00:40:52,531
This position.

902
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,659
There's a major tendon here
in front of the armpits.

903
00:40:56,219 --> 00:40:57,419
According to folklore,

904
00:40:58,179 --> 00:40:59,659
there are nine locks in the human body.

905
00:40:59,699 --> 00:41:00,556
This is one of them.

906
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,121
It's called the Soul-returning Lock.

907
00:41:03,332 --> 00:41:04,253
Guys, remember this.

908
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,100
When you're in an emergency,

909
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:09,379
lift the major tendon in the front
of the armpits with all your might.

910
00:41:09,645 --> 00:41:10,524
Try to pull it.

911
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:12,980
Some patients might recover from it.

912
00:41:13,803 --> 00:41:14,691
This is amazing.

913
00:41:14,899 --> 00:41:15,740
Mr Ren,

914
00:41:15,939 --> 00:41:17,020
how long do I need to learn this

915
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:18,020
before I can apply it in real life?

916
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:20,899
This skill?

917
00:41:20,899 --> 00:41:22,453
-Five years?
-Five months?

918
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:24,740
TCM practitioners are usually old.

919
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:25,941
They're only valuable when they're old.

920
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:27,340
I think it'll take at least 50 years.

921
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,892
Five days.

922
00:41:31,372 --> 00:41:32,572
Five days?

923
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,394
That quick?

924
00:41:33,419 --> 00:41:34,219
Five days?

925
00:41:34,219 --> 00:41:35,219
Can anyone learn this?

926
00:41:35,219 --> 00:41:36,100
Yes.

927
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:37,859
Wait, sir.

928
00:41:37,859 --> 00:41:39,699
I have to learn this.

929
00:41:39,699 --> 00:41:41,179
So, I can revive someone

930
00:41:41,179 --> 00:41:42,580
by pulling the tendon
in front of the armpits?

931
00:41:42,899 --> 00:41:43,784
I have to learn this.

932
00:41:45,387 --> 00:41:46,308
You're trying to run

933
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,580
before you learn how to walk, huh?

934
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:48,740
She's eager for instant success.

935
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:50,459
It only takes five days
to master this skill.

936
00:41:50,459 --> 00:41:52,659
However, it takes a lifetime for one

937
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,500
to understand the logic behind it.

938
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,260
I don't need to learn
the logic behind it.

939
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:58,219
I just need to master the skill.

940
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,406
Mr Ren,

941
00:42:01,692 --> 00:42:02,972
you have to teach me this.

942
00:42:03,436 --> 00:42:05,716
Mr Kong fell unconscious
in front of me.

943
00:42:05,899 --> 00:42:07,340
He might not be dead

944
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:08,740
if I knew how to do this back then.

945
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:10,899
Everyone only has one life.

946
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:14,219
His lifespan has nothing to do with you.

947
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:16,179
Such comparison

948
00:42:16,595 --> 00:42:17,541
is meaningless.

949
00:42:18,701 --> 00:42:19,671
Guys,

950
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:22,379
you all are new to the field.

951
00:42:22,899 --> 00:42:24,260
You don't understand the logic
and reasoning behind such skills.

952
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:26,060
That's why you cannot

953
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,340
apply them well.

954
00:42:28,219 --> 00:42:30,740
We can spend the rest of our lives
trying to figure that out.

955
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:32,020
However, I need to master

956
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:33,540
this skill immediately.

957
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:34,820
I need to put what I've learned
into practice.

958
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,097
Mr Ren,

959
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:38,020
you were right this morning.

960
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:39,500
I want to be able to contribute

961
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,899
to an emergency like this

962
00:42:40,899 --> 00:42:42,060
when the time does come.

963
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,179
And this is useful
for the ER department.

964
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:46,740
Can you please teach me first?

965
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:48,020
I only have a limited
amount of time here.

966
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:48,980
I might not be able

967
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:50,100
to attend the next class.

968
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:51,500
Yeah, we wish to learn this too.

969
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:52,580
Yeah.

970
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:53,500
We want to learn this too.

971
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:54,459
We want to learn this immediately.

972
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:55,582
Alright.

973
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:57,139
For your sake,

974
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:00,340
we'll talk about TCM first-aid
in the next lesson.

975
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:01,232
Okay.

976
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,240
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

977
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,649
(are referenced from relevant
traditional Chinese medicine books)

978
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,124
(Do not use without medical advice)
