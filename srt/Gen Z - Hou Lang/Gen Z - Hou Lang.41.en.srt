00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,804
(Gen Z)

2
00:01:35,594 --> 00:01:37,781
(Episode 40)

3
00:01:40,164 --> 00:01:41,644
Having ups and downs

4
00:01:42,285 --> 00:01:44,324
and bumpy roads

5
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:45,965
are the standard of life.

6
00:01:46,805 --> 00:01:48,284
After a joyous event,

7
00:01:48,284 --> 00:01:50,725
a sorrowful event
is bound to be waiting for you.

8
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:53,565
There are not many sorrows.

9
00:01:54,085 --> 00:01:55,405
It's a joy

10
00:01:55,885 --> 00:01:56,965
to have someone in your life.

11
00:01:59,005 --> 00:02:00,725
You no longer doubt

12
00:02:01,085 --> 00:02:02,725
that Tou Tou is my daughter.

13
00:02:03,485 --> 00:02:04,725
But she may be

14
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:06,364
our daughter-in-law.

15
00:02:13,205 --> 00:02:14,604
Look at your expression.

16
00:02:15,965 --> 00:02:17,045
This isn't a sorrowful event.

17
00:02:19,965 --> 00:02:21,805
Your son has a wife.

18
00:02:22,205 --> 00:02:23,884
This is a joyous event!

19
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:26,685
This...

20
00:02:28,045 --> 00:02:30,045
Is this a joyous event?

21
00:02:33,685 --> 00:02:35,124
How do you know?

22
00:02:37,325 --> 00:02:40,045
Can't you accept it
if you have another younger sister?

23
00:02:40,045 --> 00:02:41,804
I don't want a younger sister!

24
00:02:41,804 --> 00:02:43,604
You took my future away!

25
00:02:43,645 --> 00:02:45,484
I have nothing left!

26
00:02:47,445 --> 00:02:48,604
As a mother,

27
00:02:49,244 --> 00:02:50,965
don't you even understand your son?

28
00:02:51,564 --> 00:02:53,765
As a wife,
I don't even understand my husband!

29
00:02:55,804 --> 00:02:56,645
Alright.

30
00:02:56,965 --> 00:02:58,804
Just wait to bless them.

31
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:00,725
At the end of our life,

32
00:03:01,844 --> 00:03:03,844
nothing is ours.

33
00:03:04,045 --> 00:03:05,725
Your son is not yours.

34
00:03:06,164 --> 00:03:08,005
He belongs to his wife.

35
00:03:08,844 --> 00:03:09,765
I'll

36
00:03:10,365 --> 00:03:12,164
take care of you.

37
00:03:14,484 --> 00:03:16,244
Stop worrying about them.

38
00:03:22,484 --> 00:03:23,604
Why the humming?

39
00:03:26,405 --> 00:03:27,484
You should be happy.

40
00:03:28,765 --> 00:03:29,685
I think

41
00:03:30,765 --> 00:03:32,204
the inheritor of our family

42
00:03:32,765 --> 00:03:34,725
may be Tou Tou.

43
00:03:35,844 --> 00:03:36,804
Your son

44
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,765
can get someone like Tou Tou.

45
00:03:39,765 --> 00:03:41,365
That means he is blessed.

46
00:03:42,164 --> 00:03:43,925
Tou Tou can handle things well.

47
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:46,045
You're right.

48
00:03:48,965 --> 00:03:49,604
Okay.

49
00:03:50,405 --> 00:03:51,045
I don't care

50
00:03:51,685 --> 00:03:52,604
and I can't control it anymore.

51
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:54,405
You've stopped being stubborn already?

52
00:03:56,405 --> 00:03:57,045
Or what?

53
00:03:57,205 --> 00:03:57,925
Or

54
00:03:58,685 --> 00:03:59,925
be yourself.

55
00:04:01,485 --> 00:04:02,685
Don't bother

56
00:04:02,965 --> 00:04:04,084
with the kids' matter.

57
00:04:04,485 --> 00:04:05,405
Tou Tou

58
00:04:06,685 --> 00:04:08,205
is indeed a good girl.

59
00:04:09,485 --> 00:04:11,965
Only our family can handle her.

60
00:04:15,524 --> 00:04:17,084
As expected of my wife.

61
00:04:17,765 --> 00:04:19,244
You can't afford to take it,

62
00:04:19,925 --> 00:04:21,244
but you can let it go.

63
00:04:21,405 --> 00:04:22,884
Nonsense! You're so annoying!

64
00:04:26,685 --> 00:04:28,364
Aren't you going to tell Tou Tou?

65
00:04:28,565 --> 00:04:30,405
Do you want to see
the two kids getting tortured?

66
00:04:30,765 --> 00:04:32,045
You tell them

67
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:33,485
such a joyous event.

68
00:04:33,685 --> 00:04:35,285
I'll let you be the good guy.

69
00:04:35,765 --> 00:04:37,685
I'll give you a big gift.

70
00:04:38,485 --> 00:04:40,444
Get along well with
your daughter-in-law in the future.

71
00:04:44,565 --> 00:04:45,965
Thank you, my husband.

72
00:04:48,565 --> 00:04:49,724
Good for you, my wife.

73
00:05:38,989 --> 00:05:40,191
(Video Call)

74
00:06:19,836 --> 00:06:21,507
(The other part has declined)

75
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,484
(Is it inconvenient right now?)

76
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,734
(Let's not see each other for now.)

77
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,965
(I'm afraid I won't be able to stop
myself from going home when I see you.)

78
00:06:58,648 --> 00:07:00,812
(I can't leave this place yet.)

79
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,360
(But, can you send
a voice message to me?)

80
00:07:13,463 --> 00:07:15,518
(But, can you send
a voice message to me?)

81
00:07:23,372 --> 00:07:24,371
(Hold to talk)

82
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,104
(Ren Xin Zheng)

83
00:08:37,674 --> 00:08:40,471
(Zhao Li Quan)

84
00:08:54,965 --> 00:08:55,565
(Come.)

85
00:08:56,044 --> 00:08:56,845
(Take two steps.)

86
00:08:57,524 --> 00:08:58,244
(Take two steps.)

87
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:06,084
Did you see it?

88
00:09:06,524 --> 00:09:07,364
He can walk now!

89
00:09:18,204 --> 00:09:19,764
I'm fine now, dear wife.

90
00:09:20,965 --> 00:09:23,084
Wu, you must work hard.

91
00:09:24,165 --> 00:09:25,885
I'm waiting for you.

92
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,826
(Wuhan Must Win)
(China Must Win)

93
00:11:36,045 --> 00:11:36,605
Good!

94
00:11:37,324 --> 00:11:38,845
They even have a pulse-checking style.

95
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:39,365
Like this.

96
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:41,084
This is called...

97
00:11:42,124 --> 00:11:42,684
What are you doing?

98
00:11:43,485 --> 00:11:44,444
What are you doing?

99
00:11:46,485 --> 00:11:47,485
Tou Tou, dance!

100
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:48,965
Just dance!

101
00:11:50,805 --> 00:11:51,805
Don't fool around!

102
00:11:57,084 --> 00:11:58,045
Mom, look!

103
00:12:07,925 --> 00:12:08,524
Get down to business.

104
00:12:08,805 --> 00:12:09,485
Get down to business.

105
00:12:22,165 --> 00:12:22,725
Good.

106
00:12:23,605 --> 00:12:25,004
Come on! Come on!

107
00:12:25,805 --> 00:12:26,725
Let's dance together!

108
00:12:29,324 --> 00:12:30,084
Xiao Hong!

109
00:12:35,764 --> 00:12:36,564
Xiao Hong!

110
00:12:37,165 --> 00:12:38,245
My dear Hong.

111
00:12:38,684 --> 00:12:40,764
I, Peng Shi Yan,

112
00:12:41,165 --> 00:12:42,845
am an outstanding graduate of
the Preparation of Pregnancy.

113
00:12:43,365 --> 00:12:44,564
Can you consider

114
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,805
to be my child's mother?

115
00:12:55,805 --> 00:12:57,684
Stop, stop.

116
00:12:59,324 --> 00:13:01,365
This is a very serious matter.

117
00:13:01,564 --> 00:13:02,405
Marry you

118
00:13:02,444 --> 00:13:04,165
is the very, very, very,

119
00:13:04,165 --> 00:13:05,444
very serious matter in my life.

120
00:13:06,245 --> 00:13:08,045
You are the love of my life
that I have fought for.

121
00:13:08,165 --> 00:13:09,285
We have fought shoulder to shoulder.

122
00:13:09,684 --> 00:13:10,644
I cannot accept that

123
00:13:10,684 --> 00:13:11,884
you are not there in my future life.

124
00:13:11,884 --> 00:13:13,004
I can't even imagine

125
00:13:13,045 --> 00:13:15,204
the mother of my future child isn't you.

126
00:13:16,365 --> 00:13:18,045
When I think of our children

127
00:13:18,045 --> 00:13:19,045
can come to the medical center with us,

128
00:13:19,045 --> 00:13:21,444
I feel very warm in my heart.

129
00:13:22,045 --> 00:13:22,564
So,

130
00:13:23,485 --> 00:13:24,365
Ms. Yang Xiao Hong,

131
00:13:24,684 --> 00:13:26,444
can you consider carefully

132
00:13:27,245 --> 00:13:28,004
to marry me?

133
00:13:28,485 --> 00:13:29,605
Marry him!

134
00:13:29,605 --> 00:13:36,884
Marry him!

135
00:13:37,444 --> 00:13:40,564
Well, I have considered very carefully,

136
00:13:40,564 --> 00:13:42,165
that's why I stopped you.

137
00:13:43,805 --> 00:13:45,204
It's not that I don't want to marry you.

138
00:13:46,004 --> 00:13:46,925
But

139
00:13:47,245 --> 00:13:49,564
we must sign a prenuptial agreement.

140
00:13:50,245 --> 00:13:52,045
For example,
should we register a marriage first

141
00:13:52,045 --> 00:13:53,045
or get a child first.

142
00:13:53,045 --> 00:13:54,204
We must make this clear.

143
00:13:55,444 --> 00:13:57,045
So, if I'm infertile,

144
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:58,124
will you abandon me?

145
00:13:59,245 --> 00:14:00,204
Yes, we'll be fair.

146
00:14:00,204 --> 00:14:01,884
If I'm infertile,
you can abandon me too.

147
00:14:01,884 --> 00:14:02,965
All I want is you.

148
00:14:03,045 --> 00:14:04,485
If we have children,
that will be a complement to me!

149
00:14:04,805 --> 00:14:06,444
No, I want kids!

150
00:14:06,725 --> 00:14:08,084
So, we must make this clear.

151
00:14:08,084 --> 00:14:09,564
If you are infertile,

152
00:14:09,684 --> 00:14:12,245
can I go to the sperm bank
and pick a sperm?

153
00:14:12,365 --> 00:14:13,965
Would you like
to be the father of the kid?

154
00:14:13,965 --> 00:14:15,605
Of course, for the sake of equality,

155
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:16,764
if I'm infertile,

156
00:14:16,764 --> 00:14:18,684
you can also go inside the egg bank
and pick an egg.

157
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:19,564
Do you agree?

158
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:21,124
I agree, and I am willing.

159
00:14:21,124 --> 00:14:22,165
I'm definitely up for it.

160
00:14:25,605 --> 00:14:26,485
So,

161
00:14:27,004 --> 00:14:28,805
if both of us are infertile,

162
00:14:29,725 --> 00:14:31,004
would you like to adopt one?

163
00:14:31,004 --> 00:14:33,764
All of these must be
written and included in the terms.

164
00:14:34,245 --> 00:14:34,845
Xiao Hong.

165
00:14:35,245 --> 00:14:36,405
How many terms do you have?

166
00:14:36,884 --> 00:14:37,684
Name it all.

167
00:14:40,564 --> 00:14:42,524
Well, I will go back

168
00:14:42,684 --> 00:14:44,004
and list out one by one,

169
00:14:44,004 --> 00:14:45,684
and then confirm each of them with you.

170
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:47,564
So, do you want this ring or not?

171
00:14:50,564 --> 00:14:51,805
The ring...

172
00:14:55,124 --> 00:14:57,805
Of course, I must take the ring, right?

173
00:15:01,564 --> 00:15:03,245
This is the first time
someone proposed to me.

174
00:15:03,245 --> 00:15:04,124
I must take it.

175
00:15:04,124 --> 00:15:04,925
Wait a minute.

176
00:15:04,925 --> 00:15:07,605
What if we don't agree on the terms?

177
00:15:08,805 --> 00:15:10,084
I will not return this ring though.

178
00:15:10,084 --> 00:15:11,324
It'll be written in advance.

179
00:15:11,485 --> 00:15:12,204
Everyone heard it, right?

180
00:15:12,564 --> 00:15:13,564
You heard it, right?

181
00:15:23,124 --> 00:15:24,285
It's pretty nice.

182
00:15:24,285 --> 00:15:25,004
Do you like it?

183
00:15:25,564 --> 00:15:26,564
I won't return it.

184
00:15:27,564 --> 00:15:28,845
I have a wife now!

185
00:15:39,124 --> 00:15:39,725
Liu Zi Hong!

186
00:15:40,165 --> 00:15:41,204
Are you sick?

187
00:15:41,204 --> 00:15:41,925
Tou Tou!

188
00:15:42,045 --> 00:15:43,605
What are you doing, Liu Zi Hong?

189
00:15:43,605 --> 00:15:45,165
Are you sick?

190
00:15:45,165 --> 00:15:46,004
I'm not sick.

191
00:15:46,004 --> 00:15:47,365
What are you doing?

192
00:15:50,124 --> 00:15:51,805
And then there are Tou Tou and I.

193
00:15:51,805 --> 00:15:53,124
Who wants to be with you?

194
00:15:53,124 --> 00:15:53,605
No.

195
00:15:53,805 --> 00:15:55,045
I was here to send blessings.

196
00:15:55,045 --> 00:15:56,805
Looks like I still have a chance.

197
00:15:59,124 --> 00:15:59,605
Look.

198
00:16:00,324 --> 00:16:02,564
Your lineage shows that
you are the rightful inheritor.

199
00:16:02,884 --> 00:16:03,605
I

200
00:16:04,124 --> 00:16:05,725
am a rich second generation
with some successes.

201
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:07,324
We're a match!

202
00:16:07,605 --> 00:16:08,605
Who matches you?

203
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:10,605
Liu Zi Hong, I don't want
to mess around with you here.

204
00:16:10,725 --> 00:16:11,524
Let's team up.

205
00:16:12,365 --> 00:16:13,725
Our future prospect

206
00:16:13,925 --> 00:16:14,884
and future money

207
00:16:15,045 --> 00:16:16,884
will be immeasurable.

208
00:16:17,485 --> 00:16:19,405
You're sick, really.

209
00:16:19,925 --> 00:16:21,444
I, Liu Zi Hong, am 28 this year.

210
00:16:21,444 --> 00:16:22,324
I'm 185 cm.

211
00:16:22,485 --> 00:16:24,245
I'm a reserve dancer
of the national hip-hop team.

212
00:16:24,485 --> 00:16:25,324
You are my first love.

213
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:26,605
I will be good to you.

214
00:16:27,725 --> 00:16:29,285
It's her family's decision that counts.

215
00:16:31,805 --> 00:16:32,245
Wait a minute.

216
00:16:34,444 --> 00:16:35,165
Get up!

217
00:16:36,444 --> 00:16:37,485
I ask you to get up!

218
00:16:40,605 --> 00:16:41,605
Liu.

219
00:16:42,605 --> 00:16:44,084
How dare you

220
00:16:44,485 --> 00:16:46,365
snatch my son's girlfriend
in front of me.

221
00:16:46,725 --> 00:16:48,245
Do you want to get pricked with needles?

222
00:17:00,124 --> 00:17:00,605
No.

223
00:17:02,684 --> 00:17:03,124
You...

224
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:05,805
You...

225
00:17:06,124 --> 00:17:06,644
Isn't she...

226
00:17:09,684 --> 00:17:11,405
Aren't you a family?

227
00:17:11,605 --> 00:17:13,165
Of course, we are a family.

228
00:17:13,605 --> 00:17:15,285
Tou Tou is my daughter-in-law.

229
00:17:16,045 --> 00:17:17,684
That means she is my daughter.

230
00:17:18,004 --> 00:17:19,684
Professor Ren is right.

231
00:17:22,725 --> 00:17:24,084
Shouldn't you change
how you address us now?

232
00:17:31,365 --> 00:17:32,965
When did you know about it?

233
00:17:34,485 --> 00:17:36,124
It's when that brat

234
00:17:36,124 --> 00:17:38,004
ran to me and say,

235
00:17:38,925 --> 00:17:40,965
"Doesn't your conscience hurt?"

236
00:17:41,365 --> 00:17:42,485
It was at that time.

237
00:18:17,045 --> 00:18:17,865
It shouldn't be like this!

238
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,720
I cannot accept this!

239
00:18:21,925 --> 00:18:23,245
This kid...

240
00:18:41,605 --> 00:18:43,125
Kiss her!

241
00:18:43,725 --> 00:18:45,284
Kiss her!

242
00:18:46,245 --> 00:18:57,804
Kiss her!

243
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:14,725
My wife!

244
00:19:15,084 --> 00:19:15,605
My wife!

245
00:19:15,725 --> 00:19:16,605
Good news!

246
00:19:16,605 --> 00:19:17,965
Put on the mask.

247
00:19:19,605 --> 00:19:20,564
Good news!

248
00:19:20,924 --> 00:19:22,245
Let me tell you. It's really...

249
00:19:22,245 --> 00:19:22,924
You don't have to tell me.

250
00:19:23,845 --> 00:19:25,365
I've told you.

251
00:19:26,044 --> 00:19:28,204
Tou Tou is definitely from our family.

252
00:19:30,084 --> 00:19:30,725
Brilliant.

253
00:19:31,324 --> 00:19:33,245
You're really brilliant.

254
00:19:35,845 --> 00:19:37,365
So, there are

255
00:19:37,485 --> 00:19:38,924
four generations in our family now.

256
00:19:42,365 --> 00:19:43,245
This is good.

257
00:20:27,044 --> 00:20:28,044
Do you still remember

258
00:20:29,324 --> 00:20:31,605
what happened
the first time we were here?

259
00:20:34,204 --> 00:20:35,444
How could I forget about it?

260
00:20:37,485 --> 00:20:39,005
Who can compete with me

261
00:20:39,444 --> 00:20:41,444
when the sky is the limit?

262
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:43,765
Who can slay the dragon

263
00:20:44,204 --> 00:20:46,444
with a great sword in his hand?

264
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:47,725
Great!

265
00:20:49,245 --> 00:20:50,765
Excellent!

266
00:20:55,684 --> 00:20:58,324
I think you got me drunk
on purpose at that time.

267
00:20:58,324 --> 00:20:59,924
You just wanted
to drive me away, didn't you?

268
00:21:01,965 --> 00:21:03,324
I've never seen

269
00:21:04,324 --> 00:21:06,485
someone like you my whole life.

270
00:21:06,485 --> 00:21:07,924
A shameless person.

271
00:21:12,084 --> 00:21:13,965
It's innocent and unaffected.

272
00:21:17,564 --> 00:21:19,324
I didn't hate you back then.

273
00:21:20,044 --> 00:21:21,084
I was jealous of you.

274
00:21:22,605 --> 00:21:24,965
I was jealous of you
that you can live freely.

275
00:21:32,804 --> 00:21:33,444
But

276
00:21:35,804 --> 00:21:36,924
I'm glad I didn't miss you.

277
00:21:48,924 --> 00:21:50,324
Well, in fact,

278
00:21:50,324 --> 00:21:52,084
we have created a miracle.

279
00:21:52,725 --> 00:21:53,444
Miracle?

280
00:21:54,444 --> 00:21:55,845
You've never heard that

281
00:21:56,444 --> 00:21:58,284
lovers become siblings, right?

282
00:21:59,204 --> 00:22:00,965
We've broken the curse.

283
00:22:02,605 --> 00:22:04,605
This is the power of faith.

284
00:22:05,684 --> 00:22:07,804
Actually, I have never

285
00:22:09,084 --> 00:22:10,605
thought of giving up.

286
00:22:25,564 --> 00:22:26,245
What is this?

287
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:27,645
Open it and take a look.

288
00:22:33,324 --> 00:22:34,725
Where did you get this?

289
00:22:38,485 --> 00:22:40,005
We've seen the information

290
00:22:40,324 --> 00:22:41,485
on the Internet.

291
00:22:42,125 --> 00:22:44,284
That's when we could really understand

292
00:22:44,324 --> 00:22:45,125
the pain that

293
00:22:45,845 --> 00:22:47,444
Meng Meng suffered at that time.

294
00:22:48,605 --> 00:22:50,204
Thank you so much.

295
00:22:50,564 --> 00:22:52,765
Thank you for always voicing up for her

296
00:22:53,084 --> 00:22:54,245
and punishing the bad guy.

297
00:22:56,324 --> 00:22:57,284
This thing...

298
00:22:57,684 --> 00:22:59,365
I received it by accident.

299
00:23:00,044 --> 00:23:00,725
I think

300
00:23:01,084 --> 00:23:02,525
it should be returned
to the original owner.

301
00:23:32,965 --> 00:23:34,765
Consider this as a gift from me.

302
00:23:36,245 --> 00:23:37,525
Don't you pawn it.

303
00:23:47,324 --> 00:23:48,164
Don't worry.

304
00:23:48,725 --> 00:23:50,965
I won't lose any of you.

Why not...

339
00:31:19,125 --> 00:31:19,765
Tou Tou.

340
00:31:21,525 --> 00:31:23,965
You have completed
the apprentice class examination.

341
00:31:24,365 --> 00:31:25,365
You've also completed

342

343
00:31:27,365 --> 00:31:29,725

Understand?

350
00:31:45,245 --> 00:31:46,684
Young people like you

351
00:31:47,605 --> 00:31:48,444
will shoulder the responsibility

352
00:31:49,845 --> 00:31:51,365
of the future
of this field and this land.

353
00:31:52,605 --> 00:31:53,284
Think about this.

354
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:56,725
Today is the first graduation ceremony

355
00:31:57,204 --> 00:31:58,924
for our apprentice class.

356
00:31:59,845 --> 00:32:01,725
It is also the sacrificial ceremony
of Qingming Festival.

357
00:32:02,044 --> 00:32:03,245
So, the host of this event

358
00:32:04,605 --> 00:32:05,404
must be you.

359
00:32:06,804 --> 00:32:07,804
I'm afraid of embarrassing...

360
00:32:09,564 --> 00:32:10,605
I'm afraid of embarrassing you.

361
00:32:12,084 --> 00:32:12,965
How about this?

362
00:32:14,084 --> 00:32:15,324
Let Tian Zhen do it.

363
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:17,164
He grew up watching this.

364
00:32:17,204 --> 00:32:18,725
He is more familiar than me.

365
00:32:19,965 --> 00:32:20,485
Okay?

366
00:32:24,965 --> 00:32:26,204
Aren't you

367
00:32:26,485 --> 00:32:28,765
Tou Tou who fears nothing?

368
00:32:30,125 --> 00:32:32,404
You have the guts to hate
even heaven and earth.

369
00:32:33,564 --> 00:32:34,965
This is not like you.

370
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:37,245

I also

372
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:42,084
didn't study

373
00:32:42,084 --> 00:32:43,125
and have respect for others.

374
00:32:44,245 --> 00:32:45,845
Don't mention this.
Let's not talk about the past.

375
00:32:47,204 --> 00:32:48,125
Are you afraid that
others will hear about it?

376
00:32:48,444 --> 00:32:49,444
Tell me this.

377
00:32:49,804 --> 00:32:50,564
Tell me about this.

378
00:32:51,204 --> 00:32:52,204
What books have you read?

379
00:32:54,564 --> 00:32:56,324
Didn't you ask me

380
00:32:56,684 --> 00:32:57,605
to read

381
00:32:57,605 --> 00:32:59,485
"House of Confucius" in
Records of the Grand Historian,

382
00:32:59,485 --> 00:33:00,404
and Mencius?

383
00:33:00,725 --> 00:33:02,125
I've finished reading them.
They're very touching.

384
00:33:03,044 --> 00:33:03,725
Tell me about it.

385
00:33:08,084 --> 00:33:09,965
Confucius was heartbroken

386
00:33:11,564 --> 00:33:12,725
at Yan Hui's death.

387
00:33:13,924 --> 00:33:15,924
It's because he thought
no one would inherit his legacy.

388
00:33:16,605 --> 00:33:18,084
But he had never seen Mencius before.

389
00:33:18,725 --> 00:33:19,564
But Mencius

390
00:33:19,965 --> 00:33:22,284
wanted to pass on his ideas.

391
00:33:23,044 --> 00:33:24,084
So, I was thinking about this.

392
00:33:25,444 --> 00:33:26,125
Is bloodline

393
00:33:27,485 --> 00:33:28,845
really that important

394
00:33:30,725 --> 00:33:31,965
for the Chinese?

395
00:33:33,365 --> 00:33:34,564
But I figured it out now

396
00:33:36,125 --> 00:33:37,044
because I saw you.

397
00:33:38,084 --> 00:33:39,324
Now that I saw you,

398
00:33:40,444 --> 00:33:41,485
I think it isn't important.

399
00:33:45,324 --> 00:33:47,044
I am not your biological child.

400
00:33:47,845 --> 00:33:49,725
But the effort you put into me

401
00:33:50,924 --> 00:33:53,044
are much more than your son.

402
00:33:57,365 --> 00:33:58,525
So, for me,

403
00:33:59,605 --> 00:34:00,605
bloodline isn't important.

404
00:34:01,725 --> 00:34:03,164
Who my biological parents are

405
00:34:04,084 --> 00:34:04,845
isn't important as well.

406
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:05,765
No.

407
00:34:08,365 --> 00:34:09,605
Parents are important.

408
00:34:10,725 --> 00:34:12,125
Look. The reason

409
00:34:13,804 --> 00:34:15,804
why the Chinese culture
has such a long history

410
00:34:15,804 --> 00:34:16,965
and successors

411
00:34:17,605 --> 00:34:18,645
is actually

412
00:34:21,204 --> 00:34:22,125
not because of lineage.

413
00:34:22,924 --> 00:34:23,725
It's actually the cultural lineage.

414
00:34:24,084 --> 00:34:24,885
It's not the bloodline.

415
00:34:26,044 --> 00:34:27,044
It's actually the Confucian orthodoxy.

416
00:34:27,605 --> 00:34:29,804
In fact,
the real inheritance should be

417
00:34:31,125 --> 00:34:32,005
the thought.

418
00:34:32,444 --> 00:34:34,125
It is a continuation of the spirit.

419
00:34:35,245 --> 00:34:36,204
Take your time to figure it out.

420
00:34:38,084 --> 00:34:38,645
Good.

421
00:34:39,965 --> 00:34:41,245
It seems that you didn't
waste time reading those books.

422
00:34:50,965 --> 00:34:51,804
Thank you, Master.

423
00:34:52,444 --> 00:34:52,845
No.

424
00:34:54,564 --> 00:34:55,725
Actually, I want to thank you.

425
00:34:57,845 --> 00:34:59,324
It was my master

426
00:34:59,965 --> 00:35:00,804
who arranged

427
00:35:00,845 --> 00:35:04,324
the homework of
mentoring Monkey Sun to me.

428
00:35:06,125 --> 00:35:06,885
You don't know about this, right?

429
00:35:07,965 --> 00:35:09,684
You see. Even I'm at this age,

430
00:35:09,684 --> 00:35:12,684
I have to learn again about benevolence

431
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:14,164
and love.

432
00:35:14,965 --> 00:35:16,245
I promised my master that

433
00:35:16,605 --> 00:35:18,084
you would become a great one.

434
00:35:18,365 --> 00:35:20,084
That's why I'm so grateful to you

435
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:22,125
for giving me such a chance

436
00:35:22,965 --> 00:35:25,605
to practice the Disciple Gauge again.

437
00:35:25,965 --> 00:35:28,204
Previously, I understand the concept.

438
00:35:29,204 --> 00:35:30,605
But right now,

439
00:35:31,204 --> 00:35:32,885
I can finally walk the talk.

440
00:35:42,845 --> 00:35:44,325
It's not easy to mentor me, right?

441
00:35:49,644 --> 00:35:50,245
It was a tough life.

442
00:35:53,884 --> 00:35:54,604
A tough life.

443
00:35:57,684 --> 00:35:59,164
Tough life?

444
00:36:01,164 --> 00:36:02,124
Help me.

445
00:36:03,164 --> 00:36:04,765
Let me help you.

446
00:36:25,124 --> 00:36:25,884
By the way, Master.

447
00:36:30,404 --> 00:36:31,805
I am an inheritor.

448
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:34,924
Isn't the name "Sun Tou Tou"

449
00:36:36,805 --> 00:36:38,164
sounds not serious enough?

450
00:36:40,444 --> 00:36:41,005
What do you mean?

451
00:36:41,965 --> 00:36:43,045
I'd like you to

452
00:36:44,245 --> 00:36:45,325
give me a name.

453
00:36:46,604 --> 00:36:47,604
I've always thought about this.

454
00:36:47,884 --> 00:36:49,684
Give me a name

455
00:36:50,485 --> 00:36:52,045
where once you call it
and people hear it,

456
00:36:52,884 --> 00:36:53,644
they'll know that this is someone

457
00:36:54,085 --> 00:36:54,924
who is educated

458
00:36:55,725 --> 00:36:56,485
and cultured.

459
00:36:57,884 --> 00:36:59,965
Let me think about it.

460
00:37:00,164 --> 00:37:00,725
Sun...

461
00:37:02,045 --> 00:37:02,844
Cultured.

462
00:37:04,085 --> 00:37:06,684
I think that in Chinese literature,

463
00:37:07,644 --> 00:37:10,965
the most successful character should be

464
00:37:12,045 --> 00:37:12,884
Sun Wukong.

465
00:37:14,204 --> 00:37:15,725
Look, he has no parents

466
00:37:16,164 --> 00:37:18,364
and he popped out of a rock.

467
00:37:18,805 --> 00:37:19,725
But in the end,

468
00:37:19,884 --> 00:37:22,404
he went through
a long and painful journey to the west

469
00:37:23,364 --> 00:37:24,485
and became a hermit.

470
00:37:25,565 --> 00:37:26,325
One must

471
00:37:27,444 --> 00:37:28,965
wish for the best.

472
00:37:29,565 --> 00:37:31,924
Even if your life is bumpy,

473
00:37:31,924 --> 00:37:33,725
you won't muddle through.

474
00:37:34,604 --> 00:37:36,085
So, I'll name you...

475
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:39,805
Sun Da Yuan (great ambition).

476
00:37:44,164 --> 00:37:45,245
Sun Da Yuan.

477
00:37:45,245 --> 00:37:46,124
Think about it.

478
00:37:49,844 --> 00:37:51,404
Actually, I hope you

479
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:54,844
have big ambition

480
00:37:56,404 --> 00:37:57,844
and achieve great accomplishments.

481
00:38:00,364 --> 00:38:02,404
Sun Da Yuan.

482
00:38:05,604 --> 00:38:09,164
Sun Da Yuan.

483
00:38:11,644 --> 00:38:15,085
Sun Da Yuan!

484
00:38:22,404 --> 00:38:24,644
Here!

485
00:39:52,884 --> 00:39:54,085
Lao Tzu said,

486
00:39:54,644 --> 00:39:56,085
"When a man
is virtuous to others openly,

487
00:39:56,444 --> 00:39:57,765
people will naturally repay him."

488
00:39:58,164 --> 00:39:59,485
"When a man
is virtuous to others in secret,

489
00:40:00,444 --> 00:40:01,805
the demons and gods will repay him."

490
00:40:02,444 --> 00:40:04,444
"When a man does evil to others openly,

491
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:05,884
people will
naturally retaliate against him."

492
00:40:06,245 --> 00:40:07,924
"When a man
does evil to others secretly,

493
00:40:08,325 --> 00:40:09,965
the demons and gods
will come and harm him."

494
00:40:10,444 --> 00:40:12,245
"Based on these
two aspects of behavior,

495
00:40:12,644 --> 00:40:14,245
what you get in return
depends on how you treat others."

496
00:40:15,164 --> 00:40:16,884
"Tell me, is this a lie?"

497
00:41:55,924 --> 00:41:57,565
"And show off your skills."

498
00:41:57,884 --> 00:41:59,965
"This is
inconsiderate and irresponsible."

499
00:41:59,965 --> 00:42:01,525
"I hope that those who study medicine

500
00:42:01,884 --> 00:42:04,245
will not despise me
for the vulgarity of my words,

501
00:42:04,844 --> 00:42:08,725
for I am determined
to save the world."

502
00:42:31,702 --> 00:42:33,308
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

503
00:42:33,334 --> 00:42:35,161

traditional Chinese medicine books)
