2
00:00:05,297 --> 00:00:06,853
He needs to accumulate
medical affinity.

3
00:00:06,936 --> 00:00:07,834
What is medical affinity?

4
00:00:08,336 --> 00:00:09,577
It means accumulating
merits and virtues.

5
00:00:10,697 --> 00:00:13,537
Through the provision of free
medical service for three to five years,

6
00:00:14,136 --> 00:00:15,737
patients will come to him voluntarily.

7
00:00:18,256 --> 00:00:19,297
I agree.

8
00:00:20,176 --> 00:00:21,021
Really.

9
00:00:21,223 --> 00:00:24,096
We should let them go to
the countryside to be barefoot doctors.

10
00:00:24,656 --> 00:00:26,736
When they face various
difficult and complicated cases,

11
00:00:26,936 --> 00:00:28,176
they will find solutions on their own.

12
00:00:28,336 --> 00:00:30,656
This way, they will quickly
become skilled at their work.

13
00:00:32,816 --> 00:00:34,537
Do you still remember?

14
00:00:34,857 --> 00:00:35,614
In the past, we ignored everything else

15
00:00:35,697 --> 00:00:36,857
and travelled across

16
00:00:37,057 --> 00:00:39,857
hills and fields with
our medical toolbox.

17
00:00:40,016 --> 00:00:41,537
Am I right? And,

18
00:00:43,016 --> 00:00:44,577
we'd been living on the breadline.

19
00:00:45,257 --> 00:00:46,616
Do you remember? One time,

20
00:00:46,737 --> 00:00:48,057
we spent over two months
without taking a bath.

21
00:00:48,857 --> 00:00:49,697
It was tough.

22
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:51,223
Am I right?

23
00:00:51,577 --> 00:00:52,937
Kids nowadays

24
00:00:53,577 --> 00:00:54,816
won't be able to experience

25
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:56,176
our hardships.

26
00:00:57,016 --> 00:00:58,174
Think about how many people

27
00:00:58,257 --> 00:00:59,656
we had saved back then.

28
00:01:01,097 --> 00:01:02,616
But none of them

29
00:01:02,897 --> 00:01:04,537
called me the Miracle Doctor.

30
00:01:12,297 --> 00:01:16,696
You're always the Miracle Doctor
in my heart.

31
00:01:20,617 --> 00:01:21,657
I'll gladly accept it.

(Qibo Medical Centre)

33
00:01:30,376 --> 00:01:33,096
Mr Niu brought these
local specialties back for us.

34
00:01:33,297 --> 00:01:35,376
They're 100% natural
with no preservatives.

35
00:01:35,617 --> 00:01:37,977
I ate a lot of them when
I was living with them.

36
00:01:38,176 --> 00:01:39,556
-It tastes authentic.
-There's no preservative at all.

37
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,200
-Is that so?
-Here, try one.

38
00:01:41,297 --> 00:01:42,816
The dried sweet potato is really sweet.

39
00:01:43,416 --> 00:01:44,293
Wait, Ms Xia.

40
00:01:44,376 --> 00:01:45,413
You can let Jian Xi

41
00:01:45,496 --> 00:01:46,977
take more dried hawthorns.

42
00:01:49,736 --> 00:01:50,646
Roubecca,

43
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:52,297
do you take dried sweet potato?

44
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:53,657
It's crunchy and tasty.

45
00:01:55,056 --> 00:01:55,880
What?

46
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:02,537
It's sweet.

47
00:02:03,617 --> 00:02:04,973
Thanks. Leave it over there first.

48
00:02:05,056 --> 00:02:05,873
I'll have it later.

49
00:02:07,416 --> 00:02:08,577
What are you doing?

50
00:02:09,976 --> 00:02:12,136
I'm deleting my junk emails.

51
00:02:13,336 --> 00:02:15,256
Deleting your junk emails? But why?

52
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:21,696
Do you know what's an
environmental clock?

53
00:02:22,616 --> 00:02:24,616
Hong, do you mean
an environmental crisis clock?

54
00:02:25,336 --> 00:02:26,177
Tell us about it.

55
00:02:27,136 --> 00:02:29,173
You guys should've heard of
its other name before.

56
00:02:29,256 --> 00:02:30,817
It's called the Doomsday Clock.

57
00:02:32,536 --> 00:02:34,173
It was formed by

58
00:02:34,256 --> 00:02:35,973
over ten Nobel Prize winners

59
00:02:36,056 --> 00:02:37,256
in 1945.

60
00:02:37,976 --> 00:02:40,173
It will perform an overall assessment

61
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:42,496
of various ecological environments

62
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:44,533
of over 90 countries in the world.

63
00:02:44,616 --> 00:02:46,577
After that, it'll be published
every year

64
00:02:46,776 --> 00:02:48,533
to warn us of the harm

65
00:02:48,616 --> 00:02:50,577
our action is bringing to Earth.

66
00:02:51,177 --> 00:02:54,256
If the clock strikes midnight,

67
00:02:55,256 --> 00:02:57,056
it'll be the end of the world.

68
00:03:00,896 --> 00:03:02,776
Jian Xi is so knowledgeable.

69
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,090
What has this got to do
with deleting junk emails?

70
00:03:06,457 --> 00:03:07,896
Keeping your junk emails

71
00:03:08,177 --> 00:03:09,776
is akin to polluting the environment.

72
00:03:10,336 --> 00:03:12,377
Each of our emails is an account.

73
00:03:12,657 --> 00:03:13,613
The data of these accounts

74
00:03:13,696 --> 00:03:15,817
will be sent to countless base stations.

75
00:03:15,976 --> 00:03:17,457
The more data they accumulate,

76
00:03:17,696 --> 00:03:19,416
the more heat energy they generate.

77
00:03:19,817 --> 00:03:21,893
When we use our phones
or laptops for a long time,

78
00:03:21,976 --> 00:03:23,896
they'll get hot.

79
00:03:24,056 --> 00:03:25,613
The temperature of the CPU
will increase.

80
00:03:25,696 --> 00:03:26,896
And, we need a radiator to cool it off.

81
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,253
For every GB of content,

82
00:03:29,336 --> 00:03:32,336
it consumes 32 kWh worth of electricity.

83
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:35,734
There are 2.3 billion email users
in the world.

84
00:03:35,817 --> 00:03:37,374
If each of us can delete

85
00:03:37,457 --> 00:03:38,817
50 junk emails,

86
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:40,896
we can save a total of

87
00:03:41,136 --> 00:03:44,333
8.625 million GBs worth of space.

88
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:47,776
That means we'll be saving
over two trillion GBs worth of space.

89
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:49,536
In other words,

90
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:51,177
if we spend a few minutes

91
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:52,976
and exercise our fingers here,

92
00:03:53,177 --> 00:03:54,976
we can save enough electricity

93
00:03:55,817 --> 00:03:57,813
to power 2.7 billion incandescent lamps

94
00:03:57,896 --> 00:03:59,416
for an hour.

95
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,800
It's that amazing?

96
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,680
Xiao Hong, you're amazing.

97
00:04:03,056 --> 00:04:03,966
Look at me.

98
00:04:04,336 --> 00:04:05,240
I'm doing so

99
00:04:05,616 --> 00:04:07,336
for the sake of our future generations.

100
00:04:09,817 --> 00:04:10,677
How do I do it?

101
00:04:11,256 --> 00:04:13,097
-I'll teach you.
-We'll do it too.

102
00:04:13,536 --> 00:04:14,377
Which one should I press?

103
00:04:14,616 --> 00:04:15,533
-This one?
-Yeah.

104
00:04:15,616 --> 00:04:16,416
Press delete.

105
00:04:18,297 --> 00:04:19,893
I'll delete my junk emails

106
00:04:19,976 --> 00:04:21,337
when I get back.

107
00:04:51,017 --> 00:04:52,136
Hello, Tou Tou.

108
00:04:52,857 --> 00:04:54,897
(I don't know if I'll still be around)

109
00:04:55,577 --> 00:04:56,696
(by the time you watch this video.)

110
00:04:57,577 --> 00:04:59,136
(I have no way to save myself.)

111
00:05:00,136 --> 00:05:01,617
(I can only entrust my hope to you.)

112
00:05:02,696 --> 00:05:03,552
I'm sorry.

113
00:05:05,696 --> 00:05:06,857
I'm too weak.

114
00:05:08,857 --> 00:05:10,733
(But I still wish)

115
00:05:10,816 --> 00:05:12,440
(to give it one last try.)

116
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,481
(Tou Tou: Tian Zhen, come here!)

117
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,760
Did you miss me?

118
00:06:29,897 --> 00:06:31,297
You scared me. You're finally here.

119
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:32,341
Listen.

120
00:06:33,337 --> 00:06:34,263
Give me a kiss.

121
00:06:34,816 --> 00:06:36,617
Stop messing around.
I have something to tell you.

122
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,494
We can't kiss in the medical centre,
in the apprentice class,

123
00:06:38,577 --> 00:06:39,577
and everywhere else.

124
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:40,816
Even now, we can't kiss each other?

125
00:06:41,136 --> 00:06:42,297
How are we dating each other then?

126
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:43,302
Look.

127
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,297
Look at this.

128
00:06:46,696 --> 00:06:47,737
What is it?

129
00:06:58,177 --> 00:06:59,297
Where did you find this?

130
00:07:00,617 --> 00:07:02,136
In my junk inbox.

131
00:07:03,976 --> 00:07:05,177
I only saw it today.

132
00:07:07,857 --> 00:07:10,376
There are too many secrets in my heart.

133
00:07:10,656 --> 00:07:11,737
I can't tell anyone.

134
00:07:12,857 --> 00:07:14,536
I don't dare to tell
my parents about it.

135
00:07:14,857 --> 00:07:16,577
I cannot tell Tian Zhen too.

136
00:07:17,816 --> 00:07:18,617
I only dare

137
00:07:19,737 --> 00:07:20,857
(to tell you my secrets.)

138
00:07:23,696 --> 00:07:24,694
(I don't know how my life)

139
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,816
(ended up like this.)

140
00:07:30,136 --> 00:07:31,177
Since young,

141
00:07:32,136 --> 00:07:35,457
famous celebrities, lecturers,
and artists who you could only see

142
00:07:35,737 --> 00:07:39,857
on magazines and TV shows

143
00:07:40,577 --> 00:07:42,136
were regular guests at our house.

144
00:07:42,737 --> 00:07:44,057
I travelled all over the world

145
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:46,040
together with Mum and Dad.

146
00:07:46,577 --> 00:07:48,337
I even own a pony.

147
00:07:49,976 --> 00:07:50,897
I thought

148
00:07:52,177 --> 00:07:53,376
I was happy.

149
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:58,380
Mum.

150
00:07:58,857 --> 00:07:59,936
-Morning.
-Have a seat.

151
00:08:00,577 --> 00:08:01,457
Come and have breakfast.

152
00:08:07,297 --> 00:08:08,123
Xu,

153
00:08:08,617 --> 00:08:09,536
I'm going on a business trip today.

154
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:11,534
You can send Meng Meng to school.

155
00:08:11,617 --> 00:08:14,613
No, I have an appointment
with the publishing house today.

156
00:08:14,696 --> 00:08:15,584
I'm not free.

157
00:08:16,136 --> 00:08:17,214
I'll tell Guo to send her
to school then.

158
00:08:17,297 --> 00:08:18,536
-I can head there myself.
-Okay.

159
00:08:20,857 --> 00:08:22,136
Will you be having dinner
at home tonight?

160
00:08:22,297 --> 00:08:23,536
I'll be back after three days.

161
00:08:23,976 --> 00:08:26,136
Mum, I can take the school bus.

162
00:08:26,337 --> 00:08:27,613
That won't do.

163
00:08:27,696 --> 00:08:29,173
School buses stop at plenty of stops.

164
00:08:29,256 --> 00:08:30,053
It's a waste of time.

165
00:08:30,136 --> 00:08:30,936
I can do it myself.

166
00:08:32,497 --> 00:08:33,380
Meng Meng,

167
00:08:34,216 --> 00:08:35,933
why are you still wearing
your school uniform?

168
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,377
Isn't today a casual day?

169
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:39,734
I bought so many nice clothes for you.

170
00:08:39,817 --> 00:08:40,776
Go and change into them.

171
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,057
See you. I'll buy something nice
for you when I come back.

172
00:08:45,016 --> 00:08:45,937
Mum, goodbye.

173
00:08:49,456 --> 00:08:51,654
Meng Meng, I'm running late too.

174
00:08:52,257 --> 00:08:53,253
I'll pick you up tonight.

175
00:08:53,336 --> 00:08:54,174
We'll have dinner with Mr Chen.

176
00:08:54,257 --> 00:08:55,115
Goodbye.

177
00:08:56,697 --> 00:08:57,617
Goodbye, Dad.

178
00:09:11,896 --> 00:09:12,779
Meng Meng,

179
00:09:12,896 --> 00:09:13,787
happy birthday.

180
00:09:14,336 --> 00:09:15,737
Longevity noodles are a must
during birthdays.

181
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,080
(Jiangzhou Jos International School)

182
00:09:27,096 --> 00:09:28,013
Wait for me.

183
00:09:28,656 --> 00:09:29,591
Hurry up.

184
00:09:42,336 --> 00:09:43,576
(But in reality,)

185
00:09:44,456 --> 00:09:46,336
(I was envious of my classmates)

186
00:09:46,576 --> 00:09:48,497
(who could do their homework
together in cafes.)

187
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:53,016
(They could worship their
favourite idols during holidays.)

188
00:09:55,016 --> 00:09:56,297
After I got to know you,

189
00:09:56,576 --> 00:09:57,560
I was most envious of you.

190
00:09:58,576 --> 00:10:00,377
I wanted to be as free as you.

191
00:10:08,016 --> 00:10:08,880
(That's wrong.)

192
00:10:09,456 --> 00:10:10,776
(Dad and Mum treat me nicely.)

193
00:10:11,336 --> 00:10:12,697
I'm already happy.

194
00:10:14,336 --> 00:10:16,456
I shouldn't be so greedy.

195
00:10:17,697 --> 00:10:19,817
(Although they're always by my side,)

196
00:10:20,096 --> 00:10:21,656
(they never know)

197
00:10:22,576 --> 00:10:25,177
(what I think and what I want.)

198
00:10:26,456 --> 00:10:27,536
Inside my heart,

199
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:31,257
there's a beast.

200
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:35,016
(I started to fear the night.)

201
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:37,377
(I started to fear sleeping.)

202
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,336
It's because that beast

203
00:10:40,016 --> 00:10:42,617
always comes out
in the middle of the night.

204
00:10:43,016 --> 00:10:44,536
It even appeared in my dream.

205
00:10:46,817 --> 00:10:48,896
(I felt like I was
losing control of it.)

206
00:10:49,576 --> 00:10:50,560
(I was afraid,)

207
00:10:51,016 --> 00:10:52,336
(but I couldn't hold it in.)

208
00:10:52,576 --> 00:10:54,857
(I didn't know what I should do.)

209
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:57,536
(Tou Tou, do you know something?)

210
00:10:58,137 --> 00:11:00,216
(When my mother found out,)

211
00:11:01,016 --> 00:11:02,576
although I was very afraid,

212
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:05,137
I felt

213
00:11:05,776 --> 00:11:07,734
a sense of relief

214
00:11:07,817 --> 00:11:09,137
for some reason.

215
00:11:09,257 --> 00:11:10,497
It's like she finally found out.

216
00:11:13,456 --> 00:11:14,377
I thought

217
00:11:16,016 --> 00:11:17,737
she would teach me how to chase it away.

218
00:11:22,096 --> 00:11:23,216
What are you doing?

219
00:11:25,697 --> 00:11:26,614
(That was my first time)

220
00:11:26,697 --> 00:11:28,216
(seeing my mother getting enraged.)

221
00:11:29,216 --> 00:11:30,937
(She told me off and said
I was shameless.)

222
00:11:31,776 --> 00:11:34,817
(She made it as if
I was something indecent.)

223
00:11:35,776 --> 00:11:38,257
(I think Dad smoked a lot too
on that day.)

224
00:11:38,817 --> 00:11:41,257
(He was never this flustered even when)

225
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:43,416
(he was the head of a national project.)

226
00:11:44,697 --> 00:11:45,857
(I was ashamed of myself.)

227
00:11:54,896 --> 00:11:55,976
I'm a sinner.

228
00:12:04,257 --> 00:12:06,216
(They said I must correct my ways.)

229
00:12:06,456 --> 00:12:07,377
I know that.

230
00:12:09,456 --> 00:12:10,697
I wish to become better.

231
00:12:11,377 --> 00:12:12,737
(I will become better.)

232
00:12:13,016 --> 00:12:14,216
(I can become better.)

233
00:12:15,137 --> 00:12:16,416
(I did put a lot of effort into it.)

234
00:12:18,576 --> 00:12:19,529
Meng Meng,

235
00:12:19,817 --> 00:12:21,697
we're doing this for your sake.

236
00:12:22,336 --> 00:12:23,614
We'll monitor you

237
00:12:23,697 --> 00:12:25,817
and help you to correct
your mistakes together, okay?

238
00:12:28,336 --> 00:12:29,287
Okay.

239
00:12:29,456 --> 00:12:30,435
All done.

240
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,701
There's no blind spot now.

241
00:12:40,896 --> 00:12:42,817
But it was too difficult.

242
00:12:43,456 --> 00:12:44,576
It was too difficult for me.

243
00:12:49,576 --> 00:12:50,373
Meng Meng,

244
00:12:50,456 --> 00:12:52,057
now, we can have peace of mind.

245
00:12:52,576 --> 00:12:53,933
Now that we have a camera here,

246
00:12:54,016 --> 00:12:55,414
your father and I can rush here

247
00:12:55,497 --> 00:12:56,933
immediately

248
00:12:57,016 --> 00:12:58,257
if anything happens.

249
00:12:59,216 --> 00:13:01,497
Sleep tight, okay?

250
00:13:03,336 --> 00:13:05,497
Meng Meng, take out your hands.

251
00:13:06,896 --> 00:13:07,740
Good girl.

252
00:13:13,016 --> 00:13:14,016
That's more like it.

253
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:16,416
Alright, goodnight.

254
00:13:16,656 --> 00:13:17,817
Dad and Mum will watch over you.

255
00:13:18,817 --> 00:13:20,096
I'll go now. Goodnight.

256
00:13:43,976 --> 00:13:45,896
It's shameful to have parents like them.

257
00:13:47,896 --> 00:13:48,697
It's my fault too.

258
00:13:49,336 --> 00:13:50,734
I never discovered her habit

259
00:13:50,817 --> 00:13:51,937
even though we lived together
for a long time.

260
00:13:53,016 --> 00:13:55,697
Meng Meng's behaviour should expand
beyond the scope of normal puberty.

261
00:13:56,817 --> 00:13:58,257
She should be a sex addict.

262
00:14:02,656 --> 00:14:03,568
Sex addict?

263
00:14:05,937 --> 00:14:07,497
It's just like Internet addiction.

264
00:14:08,497 --> 00:14:09,365
Yes.

265
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:11,693
She had obsessive needs

266
00:14:11,776 --> 00:14:13,336
toward intimate relationships and acts.

267
00:14:13,497 --> 00:14:14,697
It's a type of disorder.

268
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:17,493
Her parents shouldn't
jump to conclusions

269
00:14:17,576 --> 00:14:19,016
and think that it was an issue
with her lifestyle.

270
00:14:21,697 --> 00:14:22,817
With parents like them,

271
00:14:23,937 --> 00:14:25,377
even normal children
will get sick eventually.

272
00:14:26,257 --> 00:14:27,253
For sex addicts,
there are psychological factors

273
00:14:27,336 --> 00:14:28,257
and pathological factors.

274
00:14:28,896 --> 00:14:30,497
My grandfather used to
have a patient like her.

275
00:14:31,377 --> 00:14:32,734
He had a tumour in his brain.

276
00:14:32,817 --> 00:14:34,137
It affected his pituitary gland.

277
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:36,013
It's a shame that we have
no evidence now.

278
00:14:36,096 --> 00:14:37,082
I'm speechless.

279
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,249
To think that her parents
are actually intellectuals.

280
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:42,036
They didn't even know
that their child was acting as such

281
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,199
due to a disorder.

282
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:44,586
They're only intellectuals
in certain fields.

283
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:45,869
It's not like they're
good at everything.

284
00:14:46,656 --> 00:14:48,497
I would have no idea
had I not encountered Meng Meng.

285
00:14:55,817 --> 00:14:56,896
You didn't realise it

286
00:14:57,177 --> 00:14:58,336
even when you spent so much time

287
00:14:58,697 --> 00:14:59,697
with Meng Meng?

288
00:15:09,896 --> 00:15:12,216
During a volunteer activity,

289
00:15:12,817 --> 00:15:14,257
I met Nan.

290
00:15:14,697 --> 00:15:17,257
He praised me for the puppy I drew.

291
00:15:18,257 --> 00:15:20,817
He said they could sell it
as a merchandise

292
00:15:21,576 --> 00:15:23,214
and help the rescue centre.

293
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:26,257
(He told me to make the puppy)

294
00:15:26,817 --> 00:15:28,817
(look happier.)

295
00:15:30,336 --> 00:15:32,493
Hello. We're from the Care
and Compassion Society.

296
00:15:32,576 --> 00:15:33,854
We're holding this activity

297
00:15:33,937 --> 00:15:34,857
to help the animal shelters.

298
00:15:35,137 --> 00:15:35,933
Please take a look.

299
00:15:36,016 --> 00:15:36,817
Here you go.

300
00:15:37,249 --> 00:15:38,169
Take a look.

301
00:15:39,016 --> 00:15:40,174
There's a QR code on it.

302
00:15:40,257 --> 00:15:41,854
You guys can scan it
and follow our page.

303
00:15:41,937 --> 00:15:42,794
Thank you.

304
00:15:44,016 --> 00:15:45,813
Hello. We're from the Care
and Compassion Society.

305
00:15:45,896 --> 00:15:48,174
We're holding this activity
to help the animal shelters.

306
00:15:48,257 --> 00:15:49,697
There's a QR code on it.
You can scan it.

307
00:15:52,274 --> 00:15:53,937
It's adorable.

308
00:16:08,937 --> 00:16:11,297
It'll look happier if you add

309
00:16:11,896 --> 00:16:12,834
two more strokes here.

310
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:24,849
Not bad at all.

311
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:30,336
(He always called me Kid.)

312
00:16:31,456 --> 00:16:34,137
(And, he always caressed my head.)

313
00:16:34,257 --> 00:16:35,137
(He said)

314
00:16:35,456 --> 00:16:38,016
(my eyes were like a puppy's.)

315
00:16:38,776 --> 00:16:40,137
(Actually, I wanted to tell him)

316
00:16:40,896 --> 00:16:42,416
(that I was the wandering puppy.)

317
00:16:43,776 --> 00:16:44,817
I wanted him

318
00:16:46,257 --> 00:16:47,177
to bring me back.

319
00:16:49,336 --> 00:16:51,416
(I skipped my drawing classes.)

320
00:16:52,257 --> 00:16:54,857
(I even lied to my parents
in order to go outside.)

321
00:16:55,656 --> 00:16:56,817
(But I was happy.)

322
00:16:59,016 --> 00:17:00,013
I don't know

323
00:17:00,096 --> 00:17:02,216
how I could treat him better.

324
00:17:02,937 --> 00:17:05,613
(That's why I gave him)

325
00:17:05,696 --> 00:17:06,646
(everything he wanted.)

326
00:17:12,777 --> 00:17:14,537
I could dig my heart out
if he wanted to see it.

327
00:17:19,816 --> 00:17:20,737
But I forgot.

328
00:17:21,696 --> 00:17:22,552
In my heart,

329
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:25,857
there's a beast.

330
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,480
(I thought you're an
innocent and pure girl.)

331
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,244
(Nan, I'm sorry.)

332
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,405
(These are all excuses! You look so
innocent, why are you so complicated?)

333
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,880
(Of course I'm upset that
you don't belong to me.)

334
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,960
(Let's calm down for a while.)

335
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,960
(Meng Meng)

336
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:55,833
(Call declined)

337
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,560
(Nan, please pick up my call.)

338
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,920
(I was wrong. What can I do
to make you forgive me?)

339
00:18:10,691 --> 00:18:11,640
(My heart aches when I see you.
I am a very possessive person.)

340
00:18:11,751 --> 00:18:12,920
(I can't concentrate on my contest these
days. I've never been like this before.)

341
00:18:13,031 --> 00:18:14,200
(I feel so sorry for myself. I despise
myself for falling in love with you.)

342
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,720
(Nan, I love you too. I'm willing to
do whatever you want me to do.)

343
00:18:20,008 --> 00:18:21,553
(Look at you, here you go again.)

344
00:18:21,636 --> 00:18:24,515
(You're willing to do anything
for every man.)

345
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,920
(No, I'm not.)

346
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,794
(Then prove to me
that you are only mine.)

347
00:18:43,096 --> 00:18:44,613
(I wanted him to forgive me)

348
00:18:44,696 --> 00:18:45,897
(no matter what I had to do.)

349
00:19:08,216 --> 00:19:09,294
(He's the key)

350
00:19:09,377 --> 00:19:11,377
(to keep the beast
in my heart in check.)

351
00:19:12,377 --> 00:19:14,216
(I didn't want to
disappoint him anymore.)

352
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:16,257
(I knew what I had to do.)

353
00:19:17,897 --> 00:19:19,096
As long as I stay obedient,

354
00:19:19,816 --> 00:19:20,857
he would smile.

355
00:19:22,617 --> 00:19:23,498
However,

356
00:19:26,257 --> 00:19:27,936
he was truly hard to please.

357
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:33,497
Xu Meng, we'll perform fallectomy
on your left ovarian tube.

358
00:21:05,456 --> 00:21:06,377
(Encountering you guys)

359
00:21:06,897 --> 00:21:09,176
(might be the luckiest thing
that has happened to me.)

360
00:21:10,216 --> 00:21:11,216
(Over the past year,)

361
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:13,934
I experienced a sense of relaxation
that I never had before.

362
00:21:14,017 --> 00:21:15,777
I love the smell of herbs
in the medical centre.

363
00:21:16,377 --> 00:21:17,857
I love everyone in the apprentice class.

364
00:21:19,456 --> 00:21:20,976
I like Jian Xi especially.

365
00:21:22,257 --> 00:21:23,176
When I saw her,

366
00:21:24,257 --> 00:21:25,176
I knew

367
00:21:25,737 --> 00:21:27,257
we could sympathize with each other.

368
00:21:29,096 --> 00:21:30,576
Her body is handicapped

369
00:21:31,696 --> 00:21:33,216
while my mental state is handicapped.

370
00:21:39,137 --> 00:21:40,497
(I'm a vile girl.)

371
00:21:41,857 --> 00:21:43,976
(I don't deserve your kindness.)

372
00:21:44,696 --> 00:21:45,893
It's excruciating

373
00:21:45,976 --> 00:21:47,257
whenever I see Tian Zhen.

374
00:21:49,257 --> 00:21:50,657
I'm so shameless.

375
00:21:51,456 --> 00:21:53,137
I haven't improved at all.

376
00:21:56,336 --> 00:21:58,336
I was born a sinner.

377
00:22:05,497 --> 00:22:06,534
(Nan looked for me lately.)

378
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:07,857
(He said he couldn't forget about me.)

379
00:22:07,976 --> 00:22:10,576
Tou Tou, he has
my dirty secrets with him.

380
00:22:10,737 --> 00:22:11,617
I cannot escape from him.

381
00:22:11,857 --> 00:22:13,414
If he posts them online,

382
00:22:13,497 --> 00:22:14,936
my parents will be humiliated.

383
00:22:15,137 --> 00:22:16,137
Can you help me out?

384
00:22:16,456 --> 00:22:17,654
Tou Tou, I'm begging you.

385
00:22:17,737 --> 00:22:18,669
I'm begging you.

386
00:22:20,417 --> 00:22:21,257
Who are you calling?

387
00:22:22,377 --> 00:22:23,271
What are you doing?

388
00:22:23,617 --> 00:22:24,443
Give me your phone.

389
00:22:24,857 --> 00:22:25,693
Right now!

390
00:22:26,257 --> 00:22:27,068
Give it to me!

391
00:22:28,576 --> 00:22:29,696
Are you contacting that man again?

392
00:22:30,696 --> 00:22:32,613
How could you be so indiscreet?

393
00:22:32,696 --> 00:22:34,096
Can't you live without a man?

394
00:22:34,976 --> 00:22:36,456
Are you even our daughter?

395
00:22:42,316 --> 00:22:43,519
(Our tie is gone, our child is gone!)

396
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:44,849
(Remember, everything of yours
is mine. Don't say no to me.)

397
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,280
(If you can do it, I'll marry you.)

398
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,582
(I want to see you
and I can't forget you,)

399
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:57,755
(but I can't bear to think of you living
in another man's house for over a year.)

400
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,115
(I haven't done anything,
I'm there to get treated.)

401
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,318
(Gastric lavage records
in the Emergency Department)

402
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,080
(Why don't you just let me die? The
thought of you with him makes me sick.)

403
00:23:25,163 --> 00:23:26,920
(Let me go. I can't live anymore.)

404
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,368
(Let's leave each other alone.
You need to stop this.)

405
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,514
(Let's end it here.
I won't look for you anymore.)

406
00:23:43,597 --> 00:23:46,133
(When I miss you, I'll take a
look at the old photos and videos.)

407
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,200
(I beg you. Please delete them.)

408
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:06,320
(No, I want to keep them forever.)

409
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:08,760
(No!)

410
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,822
(No!)

411
00:24:13,905 --> 00:24:15,440
(Both of you aren't friends.
Please send him/her a friend request.)

412
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,240
(Nan.)

413
00:24:20,382 --> 00:24:21,440
(I beg you.)

414
00:24:21,684 --> 00:24:22,640
(Don't do that.)

415
00:24:35,576 --> 00:24:36,737
Do you know the term
PUA (emotional abuse)?

416
00:24:40,336 --> 00:24:41,737
Meng Meng was manipulated by him
through PUA.

417
00:24:43,976 --> 00:24:45,497
Meng Meng died because of him.

418
00:24:50,576 --> 00:24:52,576
We've been living together
with her for such a long time.

419
00:24:54,096 --> 00:24:56,257
We didn't realise that she was
suffering all the time.

420
00:24:58,617 --> 00:24:59,617
We can't just let him off.

421
00:25:02,737 --> 00:25:03,630
Tian Zhen.

422
00:25:05,576 --> 00:25:07,336
We can't just let him off.

423
00:25:08,176 --> 00:25:09,456
He killed Meng Meng.

424
00:25:09,696 --> 00:25:10,816
Meng Meng didn't take her own life.

425
00:25:11,056 --> 00:25:12,737
She died because of this scum.

426
00:25:12,976 --> 00:25:14,976
We have to uphold justice for her.

427
00:25:15,617 --> 00:25:16,737
Stop being childish.

428
00:25:16,976 --> 00:25:19,216
No law can punish people who cause
mental distress to others.

429
00:25:21,216 --> 00:25:23,657
You're not a lawyer.
How would you know?

430
00:25:25,096 --> 00:25:25,897
Besides,

431
00:25:26,696 --> 00:25:27,654
we have this, right?

432
00:25:28,056 --> 00:25:29,296
We have the email Meng Meng sent to me.

433
00:25:29,497 --> 00:25:30,419
This is evidence.

434
00:25:30,976 --> 00:25:32,017
With this evidence,

435
00:25:32,497 --> 00:25:34,137
we can...

436
00:25:34,696 --> 00:25:36,613
We can make sure he gets
the punishment he deserves.

437
00:25:36,696 --> 00:25:37,529
I...

438
00:25:59,336 --> 00:26:00,976
Meng Meng fancied you, you know?

439
00:26:05,377 --> 00:26:06,336
If I knew

440
00:26:08,657 --> 00:26:09,897
it would end up this way,

441
00:26:11,017 --> 00:26:12,216
I would've...

442
00:26:14,497 --> 00:26:15,435
Would have what?

443
00:26:18,096 --> 00:26:18,976
Would you give me to her?

444
00:26:36,857 --> 00:26:37,737
I have an idea.

445
00:26:40,737 --> 00:26:41,737
Our son

446
00:26:42,737 --> 00:26:44,576
truly has a lasting affection
for people.

447
00:26:46,296 --> 00:26:48,777
He may look fine in front of us,

448
00:26:49,377 --> 00:26:51,377
but he still hasn't gotten over
Meng Meng.

449
00:26:52,497 --> 00:26:53,456
How did you know?

450
00:26:55,816 --> 00:26:57,897
I heard Tou Tou consoling him

451
00:26:58,096 --> 00:26:59,336
when I went upstairs.

452
00:27:02,377 --> 00:27:04,336
It's good for these two kids
to be together.

453
00:27:04,897 --> 00:27:07,456
When one encounters
a relationship problem,

454
00:27:09,216 --> 00:27:10,257
there's at least someone there

455
00:27:11,017 --> 00:27:12,537
to hear them out.

456
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,636
Look.

457
00:27:15,137 --> 00:27:17,737
Only Tou Tou knew
where Tian Zhen went previously.

458
00:27:17,976 --> 00:27:19,216
When Tian Zhen is treating other people,

459
00:27:19,617 --> 00:27:21,176
Tou Tou helps him to recall the details.

460
00:27:27,617 --> 00:27:28,897
You kept saying

461
00:27:29,617 --> 00:27:32,617
that I didn't contribute anything
to the family.

462
00:27:32,976 --> 00:27:33,976
Look at the current situation.

463
00:27:34,897 --> 00:27:35,697
When Tian Zhen

464
00:27:37,096 --> 00:27:38,497
is facing his troubles,

465
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:41,534
Tou Tou is there to keep him company.

466
00:27:41,617 --> 00:27:43,013
That's the largest contribution

467
00:27:43,096 --> 00:27:45,017
I've made to the family.

468
00:27:49,377 --> 00:27:50,255
Fine.

469
00:27:51,257 --> 00:27:53,737
I'll count it as your contribution.

470
00:27:56,857 --> 00:28:00,216
I just don't know
when our son can get over her.

471
00:28:07,657 --> 00:28:09,814
Lastly, I would like to thank
the academy and the party committee

472
00:28:09,897 --> 00:28:10,733
for giving me a chance

473
00:28:10,816 --> 00:28:12,617
to participate in
the aid education event.

474
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,213
I could help out those in need

475
00:28:14,296 --> 00:28:15,816
with what I have learned.

476
00:28:15,936 --> 00:28:17,013
In the future, I will do my best

477
00:28:17,096 --> 00:28:19,257
not to disappoint
my lecturers and seniors.

478
00:28:19,456 --> 00:28:21,893
I will strive to improve myself
no matter if it's my studies or career.

479
00:28:21,976 --> 00:28:23,253
I will help more people

480
00:28:23,336 --> 00:28:24,320
to build and fulfil their dreams.

481
00:28:24,696 --> 00:28:25,737
Thank you, everyone.

482
00:28:26,257 --> 00:28:27,537
Alright. Let's thank our senior.

483
00:28:28,497 --> 00:28:31,056
Senior, there's a prize-giving ceremony.

484
00:28:31,497 --> 00:28:34,056
Let's welcome the leaders of the academy
to get on the stage for a group photo.

485
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:35,493
We'll follow the name list
for individual winners first.

486
00:28:35,576 --> 00:28:36,534
After that, we'll take a group photo.

487
00:28:36,617 --> 00:28:37,657
-Okay?
-Got it.

488
00:28:37,777 --> 00:28:38,574
Stage manager,

489
00:28:38,657 --> 00:28:40,814
remember to control the time allocation
for this session.

490
00:28:40,897 --> 00:28:42,934
Tell the prize givers
to get into position early.

491
00:28:43,017 --> 00:28:44,216
-Okay?
-Okay.

492
00:28:44,657 --> 00:28:45,814
Once the teachers leave the stage...

493
00:28:45,897 --> 00:28:47,294
Senior, someone's looking for you.

494
00:28:47,377 --> 00:28:49,096
We can call the name
of the next presenter.

495
00:28:49,617 --> 00:28:51,294
Alright. We'll skip the MC's lines.

496
00:28:51,377 --> 00:28:53,456
-Okay, thank you.
-Next presenter, get on the stage.

497
00:28:55,336 --> 00:28:57,056
Hello, everyone. I'm Yu Guo Rong.

498
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:58,733
First, I would like to thank our academy

499
00:28:58,816 --> 00:29:00,096
to give me this chance.

500
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,253
Next,

501
00:29:01,336 --> 00:29:02,456
I will keep working hard...

502
00:29:07,617 --> 00:29:08,576
Who exactly are you guys?

503
00:29:09,377 --> 00:29:11,336
We know the dirty deeds you've done.

504
00:29:12,737 --> 00:29:13,897
What dirty deeds?

505
00:29:14,216 --> 00:29:15,574
We were dating each other.

506
00:29:15,657 --> 00:29:16,737
And, she was an adult.

507
00:29:18,137 --> 00:29:19,123
I'm sure you have no idea

508
00:29:19,497 --> 00:29:21,013
that she sent her conversation with you

509
00:29:21,096 --> 00:29:21,976
to us before her death.

510
00:29:24,216 --> 00:29:25,138
I didn't do anything.

511
00:29:26,056 --> 00:29:27,534
If you guys are talking about

512
00:29:27,617 --> 00:29:28,534
her spending money on me,

513
00:29:28,617 --> 00:29:30,613
I admit. She did buy many gifts for me.

514
00:29:30,696 --> 00:29:31,617
But I did return the favour.

515
00:29:32,096 --> 00:29:33,777
Isn't it normal for a couple

516
00:29:34,377 --> 00:29:35,294
to buy gifts for each other?

517
00:29:35,377 --> 00:29:36,294
Are you sure it's normal?

518
00:29:36,897 --> 00:29:37,976
She was underage.

519
00:29:38,216 --> 00:29:39,976
You seduced, harmed,

520
00:29:40,216 --> 00:29:41,654
humiliated, and manipulated

521
00:29:41,737 --> 00:29:42,897
an underage girl.

522
00:29:43,336 --> 00:29:44,185
Do you think that's normal?

523
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:46,617
Please mind your words.

524
00:29:46,857 --> 00:29:48,814
Yes, she was underage
when we were dating each other.

525
00:29:48,897 --> 00:29:50,137
But I didn't force her.

526
00:29:50,257 --> 00:29:51,456
It was a normal relationship.

527
00:29:52,377 --> 00:29:53,576
As for the rest that you've said,

528
00:29:53,857 --> 00:29:54,716
sorry about that.

529
00:29:54,897 --> 00:29:56,096
-I didn't do any of that.
-You didn't?

530
00:29:58,497 --> 00:29:59,443
Yeah, as if.

531
00:30:00,696 --> 00:30:02,096
It's because you blocked her profile.

532
00:30:03,216 --> 00:30:04,976
It's because of what you've done.

533
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:07,897
That's the reason
Meng Meng took her life.

534
00:30:08,497 --> 00:30:10,493
That's why she died!

535
00:30:10,576 --> 00:30:11,897
You know that the best.

536
00:30:16,857 --> 00:30:17,737
I'm very sorry

537
00:30:18,377 --> 00:30:19,279
to hear about her death.

538
00:30:21,257 --> 00:30:22,657
However, this has nothing to do with me.

539
00:30:24,017 --> 00:30:25,296
We already broke up.

540
00:30:26,017 --> 00:30:26,817
The law doesn't state

541
00:30:26,936 --> 00:30:28,133
that it will punish people
who block other people's accounts.

542
00:30:28,216 --> 00:30:29,417
You tortured her mentally.

543
00:30:29,576 --> 00:30:30,737
She did the same!

544
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,133
I don't know

545
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,240
how to explain the relationship
between me and Meng Meng.

546
00:30:39,336 --> 00:30:40,816
We did it out of mutual consent.

547
00:30:41,976 --> 00:30:43,733
Yes, she might be obsessed.

548
00:30:43,816 --> 00:30:45,456
But it's not like
I've never struggled with it.

549
00:30:45,696 --> 00:30:46,568
Besides,

550
00:30:46,857 --> 00:30:47,737
outsiders

551
00:30:48,336 --> 00:30:49,857
shouldn't judge
other people's relationships.

552
00:30:56,377 --> 00:30:57,248
Fine.

553
00:30:58,137 --> 00:31:00,816
Why did you threaten her
with intimate photos

554
00:31:01,096 --> 00:31:02,013
and videos then?

555
00:31:02,617 --> 00:31:03,576
Do you have any evidence of that?

556
00:31:04,257 --> 00:31:05,216
Listen,

557
00:31:05,976 --> 00:31:07,617
you need to pay the consequences
if you spread false rumours.

558
00:31:07,936 --> 00:31:08,857
Are you even humane?

559
00:31:09,897 --> 00:31:11,294
A girl took her own life because of you.

560
00:31:11,377 --> 00:31:12,936
How could you be so nonchalant about it?

561
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,320
Do you think you know her well?

562
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:18,382
Do you guys even know
the kind of girl she was?

563
00:31:22,976 --> 00:31:24,497
Do you know how wild Meng Meng was?

564
00:31:26,456 --> 00:31:28,017
Do you guys know why she fell for me?

565
00:31:34,096 --> 00:31:34,982
Tian Zhen!

566
00:31:35,737 --> 00:31:36,936
Tian Zhen, there are
surveillance cameras here.

567
00:31:37,162 --> 00:31:38,076
We're in the school.

568
00:31:38,176 --> 00:31:39,097
Listen up.

569
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:41,857
You better stop harassing me.

570
00:31:43,017 --> 00:31:44,777
I'm emotionally unstable.

571
00:31:45,056 --> 00:31:46,176
If you do trigger me,

572
00:31:46,737 --> 00:31:47,737
it'd be a shame

573
00:31:48,257 --> 00:31:49,336
for certain videos

574
00:31:50,017 --> 00:31:51,137
to get leaked on the Internet.

575
00:31:56,216 --> 00:31:57,177
Tou Tou!

576
00:31:58,936 --> 00:31:59,899
There are surveillance cameras here.

577
00:32:09,737 --> 00:32:11,096
We recorded it for nothing.

578
00:32:12,377 --> 00:32:14,216
He didn't disclose
any useful information.

579
00:32:17,137 --> 00:32:19,017
A fair face may hide a foul heart, huh?

580
00:32:19,696 --> 00:32:20,654
A person like him

581
00:32:20,737 --> 00:32:22,017
is actually an outstanding
academic cadre?

582
00:32:24,096 --> 00:32:25,216
He's rotten to the core.

583
00:32:26,456 --> 00:32:27,497
You shouldn't have stopped me just now.

584
00:32:28,096 --> 00:32:29,377
I should've beat him up.

585
00:32:34,696 --> 00:32:36,294
You may vent our anger

586
00:32:36,377 --> 00:32:37,737
by beating him up.

587
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:38,782
But have you

588
00:32:39,816 --> 00:32:41,176
thought about the consequences?

589
00:32:41,456 --> 00:32:42,777
Do you think it can resolve the issue?

590
00:33:01,348 --> 00:33:02,477
Why don't we seek the opinion of

591
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:04,210
someone smarter than us?

592
00:33:10,563 --> 00:33:12,622
Are you guys idiots?

593
00:33:14,216 --> 00:33:16,696
Do you think everything will work out
if you confront that scum?

594
00:33:18,456 --> 00:33:21,336
I thought he would be afraid
if we exposed him.

595
00:33:23,137 --> 00:33:24,497
Tou, seems like
you're green in that regard.

596
00:33:24,737 --> 00:33:26,174
A PUA top dog like him

597
00:33:26,257 --> 00:33:28,137
is a classic case of
hermit crab personality.

598
00:33:28,497 --> 00:33:29,893
Such people love

599
00:33:29,976 --> 00:33:31,737
to control the right to speak,

600
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:33,456
sense of control, and superiority
in their relationships

601
00:33:33,857 --> 00:33:35,774
and cause the other party
to feel inferior

602
00:33:35,857 --> 00:33:36,857
and lose their sense of identity.

603
00:33:37,377 --> 00:33:38,414
The most notable feature of such people

604
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,640
is that they're extremely narcissistic.

605
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:41,857
And, they always think that
they're above the rules of morality.

606
00:33:42,096 --> 00:33:43,857
People like him won't be afraid
even if people try to expose him.

607
00:33:44,377 --> 00:33:45,893
Scientifically, it's called

608
00:33:45,976 --> 00:33:47,936
a narcissistic personality disorder.

609
00:33:48,176 --> 00:33:49,576
Also known as NPD.

610
00:33:50,257 --> 00:33:51,188
Peng Shi Yan,

611
00:33:51,497 --> 00:33:53,096
seems like you're pretty experienced.

612
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,294
That's not it.
Although I'm straight and frank,

613
00:33:55,377 --> 00:33:56,414
I'm not a jerk.

614
00:33:56,497 --> 00:33:58,096
I respect women.

615
00:33:58,216 --> 00:33:59,096
Rebecca,

616
00:33:59,216 --> 00:34:01,657
can we use the chat record
as our evidence then?

617
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:05,733
Although all of us know

618
00:34:05,816 --> 00:34:07,137
that this man is a scum,

619
00:34:07,696 --> 00:34:09,094
he's not wrong.

620
00:34:09,177 --> 00:34:11,334
He did have a willing relationship

621
00:34:11,417 --> 00:34:13,296
with Meng Meng previously.

622
00:34:13,897 --> 00:34:15,574
It's just that he manipulated Meng Meng

623
00:34:15,657 --> 00:34:17,413
in their relationship.

624
00:34:17,496 --> 00:34:19,334
And, your chat records

625
00:34:19,417 --> 00:34:20,253
can only prove

626
00:34:20,336 --> 00:34:21,653
that Meng Meng was in a passive stance

627
00:34:21,736 --> 00:34:22,937
in their relationship.

628
00:34:24,016 --> 00:34:25,977
However, you cannot accuse him
with this as your evidence.

629
00:34:26,576 --> 00:34:27,937
I should've beat him up just now.

630
00:34:28,617 --> 00:34:29,697
Here's a friendly reminder.

631
00:34:29,897 --> 00:34:31,094
Intentional injury is a crime.

632
00:34:31,177 --> 00:34:32,296
You'll be convicted for that.

633
00:34:32,857 --> 00:34:34,134
It's infuriating

634
00:34:34,217 --> 00:34:35,854
that we can't do anything about him

635
00:34:35,937 --> 00:34:37,417
even though we know he's the culprit.

636
00:34:37,977 --> 00:34:39,334
Meng Meng suffered for so long.

637
00:34:39,417 --> 00:34:40,374
But that scum?

638
00:34:40,457 --> 00:34:42,857
He got sponsored for his studies
and received numerous awards.

639
00:34:44,137 --> 00:34:45,377
This is truly ridiculous.

640
00:34:45,617 --> 00:34:47,377
Roubecca,
help me check the law

641
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,040
and tell me how long I have to
be imprisoned for beating him up.

642
00:34:50,657 --> 00:34:52,496
There's no need to take such a risk.

643
00:34:53,657 --> 00:34:54,937
It's not like we have no way

644
00:34:55,336 --> 00:34:56,653
to make him pay the price.

645
00:34:56,736 --> 00:34:57,617
What do you mean?

646
00:34:58,417 --> 00:35:01,177
Beyond the law, we have public order
and good customs.

647
00:35:01,617 --> 00:35:05,016
Let's give him a taste
of his own medicine.

648
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:09,080
(PUA is not love! Death of an angel!
Caused by academic cadre!)

649
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:12,800
(Suicide incident of a female student.
Zhang Jia Nan was the cause)

650
00:35:12,969 --> 00:35:16,300
(Academic cadre of Jiangzhou University
caused the death of a female student)

651
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:18,280
(The entire story of the PUA incident)

652
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,800
(PUA and emotional manipulation,
suspected of at least five crimes)

653
00:35:21,213 --> 00:35:23,360
(Evil PUA: Manipulating a woman
to take her own life)

654
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,120
(PUA equals intentional homicide)

655
00:35:25,417 --> 00:35:26,400
Roubecca!

656
00:35:28,937 --> 00:35:30,736
You're amazing.

657
00:35:31,137 --> 00:35:32,854
All these netizens are powerful.

658
00:35:32,937 --> 00:35:34,736
Their criticisms were right on point.

659
00:35:35,377 --> 00:35:36,697
That's why I said

660
00:35:36,937 --> 00:35:38,457
we must hit where it hurts.

661
00:35:38,617 --> 00:35:40,653
We have to launch a pre-emptive strike.

662
00:35:40,736 --> 00:35:42,296
You're the smartest person alive.

663
00:35:42,617 --> 00:35:43,814
Let's see if he dares to post
those photos and videos

664
00:35:43,897 --> 00:35:46,177
after this incident.

665
00:35:46,657 --> 00:35:47,496
If he does,

666
00:35:47,617 --> 00:35:49,816
the netizens will drown him
with their criticisms.

667
00:35:50,137 --> 00:35:51,417
This will be recorded on the Internet.

668
00:35:51,617 --> 00:35:53,576
He'll be shamed forever.

669
00:35:55,417 --> 00:35:56,336
Tian Zhen,

670
00:35:56,576 --> 00:35:58,094
you're too naive.

671
00:35:58,177 --> 00:36:00,377
You're overestimating
the power of the Internet.

672
00:36:00,496 --> 00:36:02,336
I dealt with such a case once.

673
00:36:02,536 --> 00:36:04,054
A man murdered his wife.

674
00:36:04,137 --> 00:36:05,334
He was only sentenced
to seven years in prison.

675
00:36:05,417 --> 00:36:07,496
He remarried right after
his sentence was over.

676
00:36:08,377 --> 00:36:09,933
As for Zhang Jia Nan, I think

677
00:36:10,016 --> 00:36:11,457
he'll be imprisoned
for less than 20 years.

678
00:36:12,016 --> 00:36:13,534
After that, he can do whatever he wants

679
00:36:13,617 --> 00:36:14,496
and whitewash his name.

680
00:36:19,033 --> 00:36:19,954
That's fine.

681
00:36:20,576 --> 00:36:22,897
We can sue him again
after his sentence is over.

682
00:36:38,457 --> 00:36:39,399
Wait.

683
00:36:39,937 --> 00:36:41,016
What's going on?

684
00:36:43,457 --> 00:36:45,177
Why is Zhao Li Quan moving out?

685
00:36:47,937 --> 00:36:49,016
Did you tell him to move out?

686
00:36:53,897 --> 00:36:55,256
I thought you liked him?

687
00:36:55,897 --> 00:36:57,177
Why did you reject him?

688
00:37:01,897 --> 00:37:03,056
Don't you feel terrible?

689
00:37:07,296 --> 00:37:09,056
Tian Xing Xing, I'm talking to you.

690
00:37:13,056 --> 00:37:13,857
Listen.

691
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:17,937
After studying under my master
for some time,

692
00:37:18,776 --> 00:37:19,814
I learned about

693
00:37:19,897 --> 00:37:21,657
what was existent and what was not.

694
00:37:22,296 --> 00:37:23,213
When you pick up a skill,

695
00:37:23,296 --> 00:37:24,296
it's existent.

696
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:26,500
Wealth

697
00:37:26,617 --> 00:37:28,217
and material are non-existent.

698
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:29,614
Houses,

699
00:37:29,697 --> 00:37:31,574
materialistic needs,

700
00:37:31,657 --> 00:37:32,657
all of them are non-existent.

701
00:37:33,296 --> 00:37:34,413
You don't have them at birth, and
you can't take them to the grave.

702
00:37:34,496 --> 00:37:35,496
They're meaningless.

703
00:37:36,146 --> 00:37:37,133
I'm serious.

704
00:37:39,137 --> 00:37:41,496
Two lives had been lost
in front of my eyes.

705
00:37:42,336 --> 00:37:44,977
No matter if they're wealthy or not,
they die the same way.

706
00:37:45,217 --> 00:37:46,617
It's not important at all.

707
00:37:48,657 --> 00:37:50,377
Hey, I'm talking to you.

708
00:37:52,536 --> 00:37:53,469
Let me ask you this then.

709
00:37:53,697 --> 00:37:54,776
Would you choose

710
00:37:54,977 --> 00:37:56,134
Zhao Li Quan if you were in my shoes?

711
00:37:56,217 --> 00:37:57,614
I would choose him.

712
00:37:57,697 --> 00:37:58,653
You wouldn't say that in the past.

713
00:37:58,736 --> 00:37:59,814
Of course I would.

714
00:37:59,897 --> 00:38:00,653
You wouldn't.

715
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:01,937
I would.

716
00:38:10,016 --> 00:38:11,374
Both of us were penniless

717
00:38:11,457 --> 00:38:12,453
when we lived together.

718
00:38:12,536 --> 00:38:14,134
Even so, we enjoyed ourselves, right?

719
00:38:14,217 --> 00:38:16,016
It's because we would
never be able to have children together.

720
00:38:18,576 --> 00:38:19,547
Come here.

721
00:38:22,536 --> 00:38:23,417
Lend me a hand.

722
00:38:27,736 --> 00:38:28,657
I'll take this too.

723
00:38:29,586 --> 00:38:30,516
Where are you going?

724
00:38:30,898 --> 00:38:31,859
That's mine.

725
00:38:33,536 --> 00:38:34,814
Why are you folding this then?

726
00:38:34,897 --> 00:38:35,697
I'm putting it over there.

727
00:38:36,256 --> 00:38:37,157
You...

728
00:38:37,697 --> 00:38:38,836
Which of these belongs to him then?

729
00:38:40,937 --> 00:38:41,977
Enough.

730
00:38:53,056 --> 00:38:53,961
Tou Tou,

731
00:38:54,377 --> 00:38:55,973
you didn't eat much

732
00:38:56,056 --> 00:38:57,217
during dinner time.

733
00:38:58,697 --> 00:38:59,536
Let's have a chat.

734
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:01,336
Are you troubled

735
00:39:02,217 --> 00:39:03,177
by something?

736
00:39:06,137 --> 00:39:07,617
Didn't you say

737
00:39:07,897 --> 00:39:10,217
that if we will it,
our wish will come true?

738
00:39:11,377 --> 00:39:12,693
But I realise that
it doesn't work that way

739
00:39:12,776 --> 00:39:14,056
in reality.

740
00:39:15,457 --> 00:39:16,736
For example, Meng Meng

741
00:39:17,536 --> 00:39:18,493
and Xing Xing.

742
00:39:20,256 --> 00:39:21,536
Both of their wishes didn't come true.

743
00:39:22,897 --> 00:39:25,417
If we will it, our wish will come true.

744
00:39:26,977 --> 00:39:29,217
If everyone could will
their wish into existence,

745
00:39:29,457 --> 00:39:30,377
killers

746
00:39:30,857 --> 00:39:31,657
would kill

747
00:39:32,137 --> 00:39:34,096
and gamblers would gamble and win

748
00:39:34,417 --> 00:39:35,496
all the time, right?

749
00:39:35,657 --> 00:39:36,977
I'm not referring to crooks.

750
00:39:37,137 --> 00:39:38,657
I'm referring to good things.

751
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:43,056
If so, how can we will

752
00:39:43,217 --> 00:39:44,897
our wish into existence?

753
00:39:47,457 --> 00:39:48,399
Your heart

754
00:39:48,617 --> 00:39:49,485
must retain its initial goal.

755
00:39:49,697 --> 00:39:50,977
And, your mind must be mindful.

756
00:39:51,457 --> 00:39:52,257
Your heart

757
00:39:53,137 --> 00:39:54,377
must start with right

758
00:39:55,296 --> 00:39:56,776
and end with right.

759
00:39:59,697 --> 00:40:00,688
What do you mean by right?

760
00:40:02,177 --> 00:40:04,056
Analytical Dictionary of Chinese
Characters explained it clearly.

761
00:40:04,697 --> 00:40:06,496
To right is to one.

762
00:40:07,417 --> 00:40:08,417
What do you mean by one?

763
00:40:08,617 --> 00:40:09,657
One, as in the Tao produced one.

764
00:40:09,897 --> 00:40:11,697
The simpler your heart is,

765
00:40:12,217 --> 00:40:14,937
the closer to the Tao,
and the closer you are to one.

766
00:40:17,977 --> 00:40:18,899
I don't understand.

767
00:40:19,897 --> 00:40:20,857
Give me an example.

768
00:40:22,377 --> 00:40:24,056
You see, when we do something,

769
00:40:25,457 --> 00:40:26,294
we shouldn't

770
00:40:26,377 --> 00:40:28,614
do it for ourselves.
We should do it for other people's sake.

771
00:40:28,697 --> 00:40:29,894
We must seek welfare for others

772
00:40:29,977 --> 00:40:31,457
and society itself.

773
00:40:32,016 --> 00:40:34,617
By then, when you think,

774
00:40:35,217 --> 00:40:37,496
you can gather power from all directions

775
00:40:38,056 --> 00:40:39,137
and accomplish your goal.

776
00:40:41,016 --> 00:40:43,016
There's an idiom called

777
00:40:43,137 --> 00:40:44,457
"Unity is strength".

778
00:40:46,937 --> 00:40:49,217
If you only wish

779
00:40:49,457 --> 00:40:51,657
to benefit yourself by helping

780
00:40:51,857 --> 00:40:53,814
other people out,

781
00:40:53,897 --> 00:40:54,937
that's not the right mindset.

782
00:40:56,177 --> 00:40:57,977
That's why you cannot
accomplish your goals.

783
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,699
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

784
00:41:01,782 --> 00:41:03,157
(are referenced from relevant
traditional Chinese medicine books)

785
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,765
(Do not use without medical advice)
