1
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,320
Tou Tou, why don't you help me

2
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,320
fry all the veggies in the kitchen?

3
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,680
We are hiring a chef.
4,800 yuan per month.

4
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,520
You sure you don't want
to think about it?

5
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,920
Let's see your tongue.

6
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,200
Stop rushing me, sir.

7
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,400
I'm almost there.

8
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,760
(Sun Tou Tou)

9
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,800
It's you again.

10
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,880
It's you again, Officer Du.

11
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,160
Morning.

12
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,000
Where are you rushing to this time?

13
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,080
I've got a few deliveries to make.

14
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,880
I want to deliver them as soon as I can.

15
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,240
No matter how rushed you are,

16
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,240
you shouldn't run a red light.

17
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,760
I... I didn't run a light yesterday.

18
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm coming.

19
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,960
I'm just around the block.
I'm almost there.

20
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,160
Remember, you might have
earned five yuan for this one job,

21
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,760
but isn't your life worth anything?

22
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,200
I swear, I won't do that next time.
Really.

23
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,320
There is a next time?

24
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,520
-I'll give you a ticket next time.
-No next time!

25
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,600
I swear.

26
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,760
Thanks, Officer Du.

27
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,400
I have to go.

28
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,080
Bye, Officer Du.

29
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,400
-No more running a red light.
-I got it. I got it.

30
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,640
I found her.

31
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,120
Who?

32
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,960
The direct successor
of Jiang's acupuncture technique.

33
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,520
(Ren Xin Zheng)

34
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,120
(Wu Shan Dao)

35
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,120
It's fine. 500 metres will take you
just five minutes.

36
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,240
I will come to you.

37
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,440
Tian Zhen.

38
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,640
What do you think?

39
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,200
You don't say.
My suit looks good on you.

40
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,880
-I have you to thank for this.
-This is nothing.

41
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,240
Do you think I can go first

42
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,640
in the exam today?

43
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,120
You have plans for the afternoon?

44
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,000
I have an interview at
the TCM Hospital at 4 pm.

45
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,680
I'll be in trouble if I can't
get there by 3.30pm.

46
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,880
Why don't you take a taxi?

47
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
A taxi.

48
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,080
I will order it for you.

49
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,640
That's very nice of you.

50
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,560
Let's settle for some instant noodles.

51
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,160
Never mind. I've ordered
takeout for us.

52
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,320
I'm going to get it now.

53
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,240
(Boys' dormitory, girls keep out)

54
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,280
Hello.

55
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,880
I'm downstairs. Where are you?

56
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,720
(I'm at the gate of your dormitory.)

57
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,720
Which gate?

58
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,800
(The school gate.)

59
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,600
Hello?

60
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,080
Hello? Can you hear me?

61
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,560
-Hello?
-(Yes.)

62
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:00,800
(Sorry about that.)

63
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,440
(Another call came in.)

64
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,400
(Where are you?)

65
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,160
I am right in front of the dormitory.

66
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,280
Where exactly are you?

67
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,920
Not Block 7?

68
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,360
I'm coming!

69
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,640
In a minute!

70
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,040
You said 500 metres.

71
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,640
And it took you 16 minutes
to run the 500 metres.

72
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,600
You are late.

73
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,080
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

74
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,600
There was too much going on
on my way here.

75
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,680
Please click "Received".

76
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,760
Here.

77
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,280
The food is still warm.
Really.

78
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,760
Come on.
This isn't an easy job.

79
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,520
I have two orders,
but I delivered yours first.

80
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,680
Please click "Received".

81
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,520
Please click it.

82
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,400
Hello? The flower garden?

83
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,360
Yes, I'm in the flower garden
in your school.

84
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,040
How many flower gardens do you have?

85
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,280
I'm in the garden on the east side.
You are the on the west side?

86
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,480
Okay. I'll be right over.

87
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,840
Okay, thank you.

88
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,320
You just keep lying.

89
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,680
If you were late,
you could've just admitted it.

90
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,080
I would understand.
I'm sure others would too.

91
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,400
But you are lying through
your teeth right in front of me.

92
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,840
Hang on. If you hadn't been
wasting my time, I...

93
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,920
The order is cancelled.

94
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,440
Stop right there!

95
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,640
So, you are going to
be unreasonable, huh?

96
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,800
Do you still want it or not?

97
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,280
-No.
-No?

98
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,600
Fine. Take this!

99
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,920
Coming!

100
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,360
I'm almost there!

101
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,800
(Ren Tian Zhen)

102
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,920
Are you sure this kid is the one?

103
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,520
I am positive.

104
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,120
I had the same headache as you

105
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,680
when I first got the news.

106
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,040
But

107
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,360
didn't you say

108
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,440
education is about

109
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,480
teaching according to one's aptitude,

110
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,160
without discrimination?

111
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,920
So, how?

112
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,760
Can you

113
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,840
turn this kid into

114
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,560
the successor of the sect?

115
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,640
Tianquan acu point.

116
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,040
Binao acu point.

117
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,080
Anterior axillary.

118
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,160
What did he order?
It smells so good.

119
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,920
Tian Zhen, are you okay?

120
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,800
Did you fall?

121
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,480
I should get going.

122
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,000
(Zhao Li Quan)

123
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,800
Don't be late for your thesis defence.

124
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,000
(Jiangzhou University of
Chinese Medicine Affiliated Hospital)

125
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,800
It's rejected again?

126
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,960
I just don't get it.

127
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,120
Why is it so hard

128
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,720
to get things done these days?

129
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,840
Calm down, Shan Dao.

130
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,840
When you encounter a problem,
always remember

131
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,040
to stay neutral and calm.

132
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,800
It's been so long.

133
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,440
Even God would lost His patience.

134
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,200
This is my bad.

135
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,520
I wanted to hold a succession program me,

136
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,120
an apprentice training program me.

137
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,960
I brought this trouble to myself.

138
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,600
Shao Dao,

139
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,120
the problem of TCM education

140
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,640
in some parts of our country

141
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,240
is becoming more and more obvious.

142
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,720
You see, if we teach

143
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,640
our students using
a Western medical mindset,

144
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,600
our students will use the same
mindset to solve problems.

145
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,240
What is TCM mindset?

146
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,320
We employ teaching
through clinical practice.

147
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,480
So, I believe

148
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,280
teacher-apprentice education

149
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,840
in TCM

150
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,120
will return.

151
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,160
If a student cannot learn well,

152
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,600
then the problem must lie
with the teaching method.

153
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,960
If a student isn't taught well,

154
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,560
it must be the fault of his master.

155
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,080
Your takeout is here!

156
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,400
Pick up the phone.

157
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,200
I will leave it at the door.

158
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,840
Help! Help!

159
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Open the door!

160
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,800
Open it!

161
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,680
Open it!

162
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,800
Open it!

163
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,120
Sorry, teachers. I'm probably late.

164
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,960
You are not late.

165
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,160
You are just in time.

166
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,240
Thank you.

167
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,680
I'm sorry, sir.

168
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,040
What is

169
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,160
the emergency first aid
for an open fracture?

170
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,240
The emergency...

171
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,000
The emergency first aid
for an open fracture...

172
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,600
-Do you still want it or not?
-No.

173
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,800
Fine. Take this!

174
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,120
Relax. Relax.

175
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,560
It's not a difficult question.

176
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,040
Don't be nervous.

177
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,040
I'm not nervous. I'm angry!

178
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,360
Sorry about that.

179
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,480
Can you repeat the question?

180
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,480
Sorry.

181
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,360
What is

182
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,440
the emergency first aid
for an open fracture?

183
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,920
Please tell us the emergency treatment
methods for an open fracture.

184
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,600
Help me.

185
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,720
Come back here!

186
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,680
The first step in the emergency
treatment of an open fracture

187
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,440
is to perform life-saving measures.

188
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,680
We should quickly conduct

189
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,240
a comprehensive examination
of the patient.

190
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,360
If a cardiac arrest occurs,
perform a CPR immediately.

191
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,160
Next is to apply dressing
and stop the bleeding.

192
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,880
It is important to use clean clothing
for bandaging the wound.

193
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,520
The exposed fractured ends

194
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,640
should not be pulled back
into the skin tissue

195
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,720
to avoid potential misdiagnosis
by medical professionals.

196
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,280
Thirdly, temporary splinting is required.

197
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,760
It is important to use
rigid objects for splinting.

198
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,000
The splint

199
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,240
should extend beyond the fractured
area by one joint above and below.

200
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,040
Without proper splinting,

201
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,520
the patient or injured limb
should not be moved arbitrarily.

202
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,520
Let go!

203
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,360
Stop fighting!

204
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,400
Stop it!

205
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,520
Stop!

206
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,680
These are my answers.

207
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,800
Thank you.

208
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Thank you.

209
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,280
Ouch.

210
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,360
Be gentle.

211
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,680
Thank you.

212
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,960
Why did she hit you?

213
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,320
We didn't give her a good rating.

214
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,800
You hit them just because they
didn't give you a good rating?

215
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,560
Are you sure that's the truth?

216
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,440
Madam,

217
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,360
Master.

218
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,120
Master, madam,

219
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,680
I have an idea.

220
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,160
I don't know if it will work.

221
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,160
I'd like to organize
a TCM apprentice class.

222
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,160
What is teacher-student succession?

223
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,520
How do you want to do it?

224
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,880
I will follow the example
of the ancients,

225
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,040
with teachers guiding students,

226
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,880
let education fosters mutual growth.

227
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,360
Talking about this

228
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,440
is easy in theory.

229
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,200
But how are you going
to put it into practice?

230
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,720
It's easy to find a teacher.

231
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,320
Over the years,

232
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,240
you've searched for many TCM doctors,

233
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,280
and you've got the ability.

234
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,000
But what about the apprentices?

235
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,480
Are you going to recruit
student from the medical school?

236
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,560
Besides,

237
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,280
by doing this, you are
going against the school

238
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,480
and setting up a new school.

239
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,520
Madam,

240
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,080
the 52nd decree of the Ministry of Health

241
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,360
explicitly stipulates

242
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,840
that any student

243
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,520
who aspires to learn TCM,

244
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,680
with a high school diploma
or equivalent education,

245
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,600
can obtain a medical
practice qualification

246
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,920
by continuously apprenticing

247
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,600
with a master for three years

248
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,640
and passing the medical
licensing examination.

249
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,840
Actually, I think

250
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,000
the philosophy of TCM is about harmony

251
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,920
and assistance,

252
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,360
not resistance.

253
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,360
That's an interesting idea

254
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,120
you've got there.

255
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,920
Easy there.

256
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,680
Please explain clearly
what you mean by "lecturing" first.

257
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,360
I want to conduct an open lecture.

258
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,680
An inclusive education.

259
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,120
Spread the knowledge of TCM.

260
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,320
Spread it?

261
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,400
Yes.

262
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,360
TCM is not Confucianism.

263
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,960
You can't recruit thousands
of disciples like Confucius.

264
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,160
TCM has existed for thousands of years.

265
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,680
The greatest fear is that it will
be passed on to the wrong people.

266
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,960
It will ruin its spirit.

267
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,240
And you want to pass on
the knowledge to more people,

268
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,360
if someone with ill intentions

269
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,040
uses these knowledge

270
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,240
for wrongdoing

271
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,680
and gains unjust gains,

272
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,920
what should we do then?

273
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,120
Madam,

274
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,720
integrity

275
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,120
is the way of nature.

276
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,080
The principle of nature is to be
honest and never deceive.

277
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,120
As long as a person
possesses integrity and honesty,

278
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,440
they will not betray
the precious knowledge of TCM.

279
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,680
If one doesn't understand this principle,

280
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,880
even if you give them a gold mine,

281
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,720
they won't be able to make money from it.

282
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,080
Isn't that what the legendary painter,
Ma Liang, said?

283
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,480
You are a university president.

284
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,600
Managing a school

285
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,480
is already challenging enough.

286
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,520
Why choose

287
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,160
to walk this path?

288
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,880
You see,

289
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,960
I

290
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,920
have spent half of my life teaching.

291
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,320
I have taught

292
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,400
many practising doctors,

293
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,200
but there are still too many patients,

294
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,160
and they will never stop coming.

295
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,720
In fact, we are focusing too much
on the superficial aspects

296
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,840
and neglecting the essence of TCM.

297
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,560
The essence of TCM lies in

298
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:23,200
the prevention and treatment
of illnesses before they manifest.

299
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,240
The highest level of medical practice
focuses on preventing diseases,

300
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,840
middle-level physicians
treat potential illnesses,

301
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,160
and lower-level physicians
treat existing diseases.

302
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,120
We ourselves are considered
lower-level physicians,

303
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,520
and the students we teach

304
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,080
also fall into that category.

305
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,160
We have not fully demonstrated

306
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,520
the characteristics of TCM.

307
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,240
My biggest dream is to

308
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,000
spread the knowledge of TCM

309
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,880
to every household.

310
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,440
Nip the illness

311
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,080
in the bud.

312
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,360
I was thinking that

313
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,960
I might even

314
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,640
nurture another genius like

315
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,360
Chang Sang or Bian Que,

316
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,840
I would be able to honour
my predecessors then.

317
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,880
That's quite a confident statement.

318
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,960
Good.

319
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,920
He is on his path
to achieve great things,

320
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,280
please don't be a monster

321
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,000
that blocks his way.

322
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,240
You are the monster.

323
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,200
Madam,

324
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,560
I've made up my mind.

325
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,600
Spreading the knowledge of TCM

326
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,120
is my responsibility and ideal.

327
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,440
Today, TCM has lost

328
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,040
its ancient methods

329
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,920
of self-preservation.

330
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,440
If it loses the foundation
of self-health,

331
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,840
then TCM has truly reached

332
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,480
a state of forgetting its roots

333
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,600
and is in a precarious situation.

334
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,200
(Song Yi Ren, Zhang Ji Ru)

335
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,480
Therefore, I want to

336
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,720
explore

337
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,720
the traditional model of
teacher-apprentice education

338
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,640
to test it out.

339
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,160
Do you know

340
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,920
it's against the law to hit someone?

341
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,360
I know.

342
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,560
But a scumbag like him,

343
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,080
I will beat him up again if I see him.

344
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,200
Are you serious?

345
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,600
You broke his arm.

346
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,360
He can have his injuries assessed now.

347
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,680
If he wants to sue you,

348
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,680
you... You will have to go to jail.

349
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,080
This is an interrogation.

350
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,520
Sit straight.

351
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,640
Hang on.

352
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,640
So...

353
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,760
What does that mean?

354
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,040
When I encounter a situation
like this again,

355
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,760
should I just leave it alone?

356
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,320
You called the police.

357
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,480
Why didn't you wait until
we were there to solve it?

358
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,720
I waited for you.

359
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,120
But the situation
didn't allow me to wait.

360
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,440
You should have just waited.

361
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,720
What if we happened
to be on patrol there?

362
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,920
Right?

363
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,240
Seriously you,

364
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,360
this isn't the first time.

365
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,680
You have good intentions,

366
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,000
but you always end up
getting yourself in trouble.

367
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,080
Last time,

368
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,320
you were being kind too.

369
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,480
And what happened to you?
You got scammed.

370
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,720
Can't you learn your lesson?

371
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,320
What's wrong?

372
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,480
He injured you?

373
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,000
Let's see. Where is it hurt?

374
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,080
Where does it hurt?

375
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,520
Hurry. Sit up. Let me check.

376
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,920
I'm hungry.

377
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,880
Do you have food for me?

378
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,960
Do you have food for me?

379
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,240
Thank you, madam.

380
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,680
What are you talking about?
You seem so happy.

381
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,320
Master, madam,

382
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,520
Shao Dao said

383
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,840
he has found the direct descendant

384
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:39,000
of the Jiang family's acupuncture sect.

385
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,560
Really? Where is he?

386
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,440
What kind of person is he?

387
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,600
She is a young girl.

388
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,240
About 20 years old.

389
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,040
20 years old.

390
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,440
That means she is in college?

391
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,560
No.

392
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,680
She isn't studying.

393
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,200
What does she do then?

394
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,160
Shao Dao said

395
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,720
her biological father is unknown.

396
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,960
During the year of the major flood,

397
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,480
her mother sacrificed herself
while trying to save others.

398
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,800
The girl

399
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,640
almost died too.

400
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,360
She was barely breathing

401
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,360
when she was discovered.

402
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,160
She had been living in

403
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,640
an orphanage after that.

404
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,680
She left the orphanage and
entered society when she was 18.

405
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,480
Can Wu Shan Dao's words be trusted?

406
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,280
He'd better not deceive you
with a random person.

407
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,240
That's right.

408
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,400
You are prejudiced against Shan Dao.

409
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,080
I...

410
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,560
I read her profile.

411
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,480
Her mother and the ancestral master

412
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,120
took a photo together.

413
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,360
Although it has been a long time,

414
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,640
I could still see

415
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,720
the resemblance

416
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,000
between her facial features

417
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,720
and this girl.

418
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,280
-Really?
-Her mother was

419
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,440
a TCM doctor like us.

420
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,320
I have the photo here.

421
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,320
Let me see.

422
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,560
She looks like a clever girl.

423
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,960
My master told me

424
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,720
that our acupuncture lineage,

425
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,480
and the Jiang family's
acupuncture technique

426
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,920
share the same origin.

427
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,840
The various successors are interconnected

428
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,600
as teachers and students.

429
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,840
He learned our family's
acupuncture technique

430
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,720
from the Jiang family.

431
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,600
The Jiang family's
tenth-generation successor

432
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,120
was highly skilled in medicine.

433
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,480
And he cared about the world.

434
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,200
During the Anti-Japanese War,

435
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,240
he treated numerous patients using
the acupuncture techniques

436
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,360
of the Jiang family.

437
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,720
As you all know,

438
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,720
during times of war,
medical resources were scarce.

439
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,920
However,

440
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,360
he was able to provide
medical assistance to people

441
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,440
using just a tiny silver needle.

442
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,840
This is a very remarkable thing.

443
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,600
You don't say.

444
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,200
From what I can see, even though
this child hasn't had much education,

445
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,160
but from her facial features,

446
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,720
there is a noble and
virtuous aura about her.

447
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,960
She came out to work after 18.

448
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,120
She must have finished high school then.

449
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,120
Since she has finished high school,

450
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,560
she's considered a scholar.

451
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,800
It shouldn't be difficult
for a scholar to learn medicine.

452
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,840
Is she a good person?

453
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,240
That's what matters.

454
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,320
Yes, Master.

455
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,360
I will try to learn more about her.

456
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,600
I'm home.

457
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,200
You're home.

458
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,760
Let's have dinner.

459
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,760
Did you pass the exam?

460
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,920
I did.

461
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,120
That's good.

462
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,240
You know how you passed your exam, right?

463
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,840
What is the emergency
first aid for an open fracture?

464
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,840
Please tell us the emergency treatment
methods for an open fracture.

465
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,120
You can't rely on
family connection forever.

466
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,840
When you enter the workplace,

467
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,240
you will have to rely on
your own abilities.

468
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,520
I didn't need their help at all.

469
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,040
Now you are being ungrateful.

470
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,840
Everyone in the room saw that

471
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,160
you paused for 30 seconds.

472
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,920
Did you want Professor Su to
perform a dumb show with you?

473
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,680
Sit down.

474
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,720
Your dad can't even lecture you a little?

475
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,200
You are unbelievable.

476
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,840
It's a day worth celebrating.

477
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,080
Don't talk about family connection.

478
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,760
Why couldn't you see
he had been working hard?

479
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,440
Just eat your dinner.

480
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,640
Let's eat. Let's drop it.

481
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,840
Dad, have some of this.

482
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,920
Have a chicken wing.

483
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,960
By the way,

484
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,680
I was just about to ask you,

485
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,240
what are you wearing?

486
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,040
Weren't you required to wear formal
for your exam?

487
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,640
Where is your suit?

488
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,760
And you're wearing red with green.

489
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,080
You don't take anything seriously.

490
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,040
(Song Ling Ian)

491
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,920
Grandpa,

492
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,480
eating and drinking in moderation.

493
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,840
You are a TCM doctor yourself.

494
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,880
Look what you are eating.

495
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,840
These are unhealthy.

496
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,840
Humans have desires.

497
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,080
Having a craving for food is
what makes us human.

498
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,240
Your father is not human.

499
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,240
You are insulting Dad.

500
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,320
I have to tell him.

501
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,320
Your father is not a man,

502
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:23,320
but a god from heaven.

503
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,840
I'm complimenting him.

504
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,000
He is a god.

505
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,200
He's better than me.

506
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,040
Ignore

507
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,720
the family pressure.

508
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,240
You can't be your father.

509
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,960
Just be yourself.

510
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,400
No one

511
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,160
can become your father.

512
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:51,680
Your parents raised you
according to the standards of an heir.

513
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,320
I just want you

514
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,880
to be happy.

515
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,920
It doesn't matter
if you'll be an heir or not.

516
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,400
Look at me, I handed over
the medical centre to your dad early.

517
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,080
I don't want to live a life

518
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,800
without human desire,

519
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,920
where I'm not even allowed
to eat an ice cream.

520
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,960
All right.

521
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,360
Also,

522
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:18,000
all those who were testing you today
were my students.

523
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,360
I know what they are capable of.

524
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,960
They weren't as good as you.

525
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,160
I helped them back then.

526
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,000
Now,

527
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,200
they are helping you.

528
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,760
This is called

529
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,520
repaying the favour.

530
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,680
All right.

531
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,960
With my grandson's
exceptional intelligence,

532
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,200
quick thinking,

533
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,360
diligence,

534
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,200
and eagerness to learn,

535
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,440
he can easily pass the exam

536
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:54,160
with his own abilities.

537
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,800
Come.

538
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,640
Drink with me.

539
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,200
Grandpa, Grandpa,

540
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,440
this is yours.

541
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,400
Junior Ren,

542
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,040
this is uncool of you.

543
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,640
You are burning the bridge
after crossing the river.

544
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,920
Senior Song,

545
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,480
you'd better drink as much as you can

546
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,600
before I snitch on you to
Mum and Grandma.

547
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,720
This...

548
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,000
This is the wine from
the ancient town of Dongpu, Shaoxing.

549
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,280
18 years old.

550
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,800
This wine has been buried under
the osmanthus tree for 18 years.

551
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,440
Its essence is filled with the fragrance
of osmanthus flowers.

552
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,680
It enters the lungs.

553
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,680
It enters the liver.

554
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,240
I'm good, aren't I?

555
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,360
You really are my grandson.

556
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,480
Your sense of colour,

557
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,200
taste, and smell are excellent.

558
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,480
-Grandpa, don't play tricks.
-I just want a sip.

559
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,840
No, no.

560
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,240
Grandpa, cut it down.

561
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,640
Grandpa...

562
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,240
Mum and Grandma are going to spank me.

563
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,800
It's so good.

564
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,880
So good.

565
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,200
Shao Dao.

566
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,520
(Xin Zheng, )

567
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,480
(I can't)

568
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,160
Get her back for you.

569
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,400
(Who?)

570
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,360
The successor.

571
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,600
Her action should be
considered to be an act of justice.

572
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,520
Yes.

573
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,040
This girl has got a heroic spirit.

574
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,400
It's not the first time

575
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,840
the man has hit his sister.

576
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,240
He even fractured her patella

577
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,320
last time.

578
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,680
Why?

579
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,720
He got these bad habits from the street.

580
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,600
He asked his sister for money
every now and then.

581
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,800
His sister even got divorced
because of this.

582
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,840
Based on your experience,

583
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,680
how much does she need to compensate him?

584
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,200
It's hard to say.

585
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,640
It's probably going to
cost her a lot of money.

586
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,360
This guy won't settle
unless he gets money.

587
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,840
All right. It's okay.

588
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,040
I will

589
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,440
talk to them.

590
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,480
How is this girl related to you?

591
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,640
Why are you helping her?

592
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,160
She is my

593
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,320
senior aunt.

594
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,280
100,000 yuan?

595
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,040
Have you ever brought home 100,000 yuan?

596
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,000
Now you are asking me

597
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,560
to pay that money for a stranger.

598
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,200
She's not a stranger.

599
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,560
She is your senior aunt.

600
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,280
You always found random strangers

601
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,480
and told me

602
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,800
they were my senior uncle
or senior master.

603
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,640
How many unrelated Senior Uncles

604
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,080
have you introduced me now?

605
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,520
Sweetie, watch your words.

606
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,160
You have to pay back

607
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,000
for all the wrong things you say.

608
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,760
I'm telling the truth.

609
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,400
What did I say wrong?

610
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,680
Speak.

611
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,880
Even if she really is our senior aunt,

612
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,080
given her disposition,

613
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,200
are you sure
you can turn her into a TCM doctor?

614
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,320
It took decades for you

615
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,920
and my grandfather's generation
to transform TCM practitioners

616
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,600
from rural doctors to official doctors
with master's degrees.

617
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,800
Our industry is on thin ice today.

618
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,560
If we recruit someone
who went to jail, won't it...

619
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,880
From the information given by

620
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,880
your senior uncle, Wu Shan Dao,

621
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,080
if this girl is really a descendant

622
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,040
of the Jiang family's acupuncture sect,

623
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:48,000
she has gone into jail a few times
at such young age,

624
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,840
if we don't pull her back
from the wrong path,

625
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,680
then the Jiang family's acupuncture sect

626
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,160
will really have fallen.

627
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,280
From a moral standpoint,

628
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:59,160
the Jiang family's acupuncture sect
has contributed to the nation.

629
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,040
From a personal reason,

630
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,600
we are indebted to
the Jiang family's acupuncture sect.

631
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,120
So, we have to save her.

632
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,520
How do you know that
she can be guided and educated?

633
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,320
Even for someone as unteachable as you,

634
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,400
we have not given up.

635
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,880
I will pay

636
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,200
this 100,000 yuan.

637
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,440
Bail your senior aunt out.

638
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,640
Mum,

639
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,120
my dad has kept a secret stash?

640
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,120
I will pay it.

641
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,560
A young girl like you

642
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,600
shouldn't resort to
violence all the time.

643
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,560
You got lucky this time.

644
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,440
They decided to drop the charge.

645
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,800
Will you be this lucky next time?

646
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,880
Will you please stay away from trouble?

647
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,160
Are you listening?

648
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,600
I finished the report.

649
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,400
He's waiting for you outside.

650
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,400
Who?

651
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,440
You...

652
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,040
You are the one who bailed me out?

653
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,480
That's right.

654
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,400
I bailed you out.

655
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,120
Have...

656
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,960
Have we met before?

657
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,600
I don't remember you.

658
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,160
We've never met before.

659
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,000
Then why?

660
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,560
No reason.

661
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,440
Let me ask you,

662
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,920
what are

663
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,280
your future plans?

664
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,440
My future plans?

665
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,000
I will just figure things out
as I go along.

666
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,880
If I may suggest,

667
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,160
learn medicine from me.

668
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,440
Learn TCM.

669
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,760
I didn't even finish primary school, sir.

670
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,840
I looked into you.

671
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,080
You finished high school.

672
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,160
Who are you?

673
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,040
What organization are you from?

674
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,080
This...

675
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,400
We are in the police station.

676
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,160
You are a good man.

677
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,560
I met a good man.

678
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,520
All right then. Thank you.

679
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,960
If that's all, I should go.

680
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,160
Do you have a car?

681
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,800
-What do you mean?
-Did you drive here?

682
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,320
My scooter isn't here.

683
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,520
Could you

684
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,280
give me a ride
if it is convenient for you?

685
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,800
Let's go.

686
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Where are you going?

687
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,160
College town.

688
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,360
Why are you going there?

689
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,240
I'm studying there.

690
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,000
I'm applying for a chef job
at the food street

691
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,400
in college town.

692
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,200
I will get paid 4,800 yuan per month.

693
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,280
I'm working there.

694
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,200
You are looking for a job?

695
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,400
You should come with me.

696
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:33,960
100 yuan a day.

697
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,160
You will get paid at the end of the day.

698
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,760
If you don't want to do it,
you can leave anytime you want.

699
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,440
Do you have children?

700
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,360
A son.

701
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,840
How is your health?

702
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,200
It's good.

703
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,840
But I'm not as robust as you.

704
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,760
Are you looking for a kidney?

705
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,520
What kind of people
are you dealing with every day?

706
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Okay.

707
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,520
That's fast.

708
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,800
I still can't figure out
what's going on inside your head.

709
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,320
Do I have to pay tuition fees?

710
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,720
We provide food, accommodation
and salary.

711
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,640
That sounds like a good deal.

712
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,560
Why did you choose me
for such a good offer?

713
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,240
If it were up to me,

714
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,600
I wouldn't have chosen you.

715
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:23,960
But God has chosen you.

716
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,960
God?

717
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:30,720
What does that mean?

718
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,520
Look.

719
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,120
I'm taking you to a place.

720
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,720
When you get there,

721
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,080
whatever I say,

722
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,160
you don't say anything.

723
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,400
Can you do it?

724
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:45,080
No matter what happens,
I can't say anything?

725
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,120
That's right.

726
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,480
Just sit there and stay silent
no matter what happens.

727
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,440
This...

728
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:06,880
What's wrong?

729
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:07,960
So many...

730
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,520
What are you doing?

731
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,560
Hang on.

732
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,760
What is this place?

733
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,520
Why are there so many people in white...

734
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,040
From now on, your lips

735
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,320
are zipped.

736
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,600
Why are you so tense?

737
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,040
Listen,

738
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,800
I don't want to do anything bad.

739
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,760
I'm talking to you.

740
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,160
Pay me first.

741
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,160
Why are you taking out your phone?

742
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,080
I thought you were going to pay me.

743
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,200
Transfer it to me.

744
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,720
Don't dawdle. Hurry up.

745
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,600
Cash?

746
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,720
-Do you want it or not?
-Are you serious?

747
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,800
People are still using cash these days?

748
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,760
Come on.

749
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,680
Let me say it again.

750
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,400
I don't do bad things.

751
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,680
I won't do anything

752
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,040
that is unethical and illegal.

753
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,160
Don't forget

754
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,640
who just bailed you out.

755
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:31,840
I wasn't arrested

756
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,560
because I did something bad.

757
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
You got it?

758
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,320
I'm very pure at heart.

759
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,560
After all, I have also received
nine years of compulsory education.

760
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,080
I'm not one of those
who slipped through the cracks.

761
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,160
When I was in school...

762
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,840
(Qibo Medical Centre)

763
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,400
I'd like to

764
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,560
introduce to you a new colleague today.

765
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,680
In terms of seniority, she is my elder,
and your elder.

766
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,120
Her name is...

767
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,480
What's your name again?

768
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,760
Your name?

769
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,760
Sun Tou Tou.

770
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,480
Sun Tou Tou.

771
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,520
"Tou" as in testing the waters?

772
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,200
How do you write that?

773
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,520
Hang on.

774
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,120
It slipped my mind just now.

775
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,000
Her name is Sun Tou Tou.

776
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,360
Her name should mean

777
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,080
intellectual and eloquence.

778
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,920
Who named you?

779
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,800
The director of the orphanage.

780
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,320
Sit here.

781
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,760
-Hang on. I...
-Sit here.

782
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,600
-What is this place?
-Sit here.

783
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,760
Her name is Sun Tou Tou.

784
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,560
She grew up in an orphanage.

785
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,600
Although she grew up in an orphanage,

786
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,560
she is not

787
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,960
a rootless duckling.

788
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,480
Over the years,

789
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,120
my master has invested
a great deal of effort

790
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,840
in searching for her.

791
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,680
In doing so, he has also fulfilled

792
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,760
the wishes of her family and ancestors.

793
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,880
So, today,

794
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,560
with you all as her witness,

795
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:50,520
Sun Tou Tou has finally been
reconnected with her ancestral roots.

796
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,960
Pay respect

797
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,160
to your ancestors.

798
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,320
I've paid my respect.

799
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,520
Who are my ancestors?

800
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,680
These people in white robes
are staring at me. It's scary.

801
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,760
Sun Tou Tou is the successor of the
Jiang family's acupuncture sect,

802
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,280
which is one of the sects
of TCM acupuncture.

803
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,720
Her mother

804
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,520
passed away at an early age

805
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,200
while trying to save someone.

806
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,440
She was an amazing person.

807
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:25,120
Her family is also known
for their strong sense of justice.

808
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:26,760
Although Sun Tou Tou

809
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,320
has not received
professional training in TCM,

810
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:32,040
she came from a well respected family.

811
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,920
She is blessed.

812
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,920
Plus me

813
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,280
and everyone here,

814
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,520
we help the weak.

815
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,120
I am sure

816
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,360
that Sun Tou Tou will
become the successor

817
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,560
of the Jiang family's
acupuncture technique soon.

818
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,400
Sun Tou Tou and

819
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,480
my master, Song Yi Ren,

820
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,160
are peers.

821
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
So,

822
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,160
I'm supposed to call her Senior Aunt.

823
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,400
So, by right,

824
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
she is

825
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:05,560
your senior master.

826
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,240
So, now,

827
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,320
please

828
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,880
pay respect to your senior master.

829
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,400
Tou Tou,

830
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,160
by seniority,

831
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,920
you have a higher rank than me,

832
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,840
but I have inherited the legacy of

833
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,480
TCM acupuncture.

834
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,560
So, you and I are peers.

835
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,760
Starting today,

836
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,440
you are learning TCM from me.

837
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,400
So, you should call me Master.

838
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,400
So, I'm not going

839
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,200
to bow to you here.

840
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:35,960
This is my wife,

841
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,440
Song Ling Ian.

842
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,680
She is also a fellow TCM practitioner.

843
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:43,000
She will led everyone
to bow in tribute to you,

844
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,840
the representative
of Jiang family's acupuncture sect

845
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,240
and your family,

846
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,240
for their contributions

847
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:50,920
to the TCM industry.

848
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,400
Dad, Mum, sorry, I'm late.

849
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,880
Tian Zhen, bow to her.

850
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,480
