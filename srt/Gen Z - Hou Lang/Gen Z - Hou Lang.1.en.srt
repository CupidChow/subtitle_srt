00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:34,680
(Gen Z)

2
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,397
(Episode 1)

3
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,110
(As the weather turns warm,)

4
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,385
(spring thunder begins to rumble.)

5
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,800
(Animals hibernate and hide
in the earth during the winter,)

6
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,600
(a state known as "hibernation"
during which they do not eat or drink.)

7
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,360
(The thunder awakens
the hibernating animals.)

8
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,560
(Jingzhe (Awakening of Insects))

9
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:38,851
Tou Tou, why don't you help me

10
00:02:38,891 --> 00:02:40,811
fry all the veggies in the kitchen?

11
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:44,169
We are hiring a chef.
4,800 yuan per month.

12
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,943
You sure you don't want
to think about it?

13
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,400
Let's see your tongue.

14
00:03:16,371 --> 00:03:17,731
Stop rushing me, sir.

15
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,919
I'm almost there.

16
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,274
(Sun Tou Tou)

17
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,080
It's you again.

18
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,373
It's you again, Officer Du.

19
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:37,450
Morning.

20
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,449
Where are you rushing to this time?

21
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,569
I've got a few deliveries to make.

22
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,350
I want to deliver them
as soon as I can.

23
00:03:43,451 --> 00:03:44,731
No matter how rushed you are,

24
00:03:45,451 --> 00:03:46,730
you shouldn't run a red light.

25
00:03:46,811 --> 00:03:49,251
I... I didn't run a light yesterday.

26
00:03:50,717 --> 00:03:51,519
I'm coming.

27
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,320
I'm just around the block.
I'm almost there.

28
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:55,451
Remember,

29
00:03:55,611 --> 00:03:57,577
you might have earned
five yuan for this one job,

30
00:03:57,731 --> 00:03:59,224
but isn't your life worth anything?

31
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:01,770
I swear, I won't do that next time.
Really.

32
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,730
There is a next time?

33
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,933
-I'll give you a ticket next time.
-No next time!

34
00:04:05,091 --> 00:04:05,891
I swear.

35
00:04:07,611 --> 00:04:09,251
Thanks, Officer Du.

36
00:04:09,891 --> 00:04:10,811
I have to go.

37
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,561
Bye, Officer Du.

38
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,880
-No more running a red light.
-I got it. I got it.

39
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,159
I found her.

40
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,481
Who?

41
00:04:25,451 --> 00:04:28,451
The direct successor
of Jiang's acupuncture technique.

42
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,030
(Ren Xin Zheng)

43
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,617
(Wu Shan Dao)

44
00:04:56,731 --> 00:04:58,611
It's fine. 500 metres will take you
just five minutes.

45
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,520
I will come to you.

46
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,720
Tian Zhen.

47
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,920
What do you think?

48
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:08,690
You don't say.
My suit looks good on you.

49
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,370
-I have you to thank for this.
-This is nothing.

50
00:05:11,451 --> 00:05:12,770
Do you think I can go first

51
00:05:12,811 --> 00:05:14,130
in the exam today?

52
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,600
You have plans for the afternoon?

53
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,530
I have an interview at
the TCM Hospital at 4 pm.

54
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,210
I'll be in trouble if I can't
get there by 3.30pm.

55
00:05:20,251 --> 00:05:21,396
Why don't you take a taxi?

56
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,400
A taxi.

57
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,517
I will order it for you.

58
00:05:27,011 --> 00:05:28,130
That's very nice of you.

59
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,049
Let's settle
for some instant noodles.

60
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,690
Never mind. I've ordered
takeout for us.

61
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,750
I'm going to get it now.

62
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,720
(Boys' dormitory, girls keep out)

63
00:05:40,811 --> 00:05:41,611
Hello.

64
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,371
I'm downstairs. Where are you?

65
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,210
(I'm at the gate of your dormitory.)

66
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:47,250
Which gate?

67
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:48,251
(The school gate.)

68
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:51,890
Hello?

69
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:54,570
Hello? Can you hear me?

70
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,050
-Hello?
-(Yes.)

71
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:58,330
(Sorry about that.)

72
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,920
(Another call came in.)

73
00:06:00,012 --> 00:06:00,812
(Where are you?)

74
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,690
I am right in front
of the dormitory.

75
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,681
Where exactly are you?

76
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,410
Not Block 7?

77
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:06,850
I'm coming!

78
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:07,970
In a minute!

79
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:13,570
You said 500 metres.

80
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,160
And it took you 16 minutes
to run the 500 metres.

81
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,120
You are late.

82
00:06:16,201 --> 00:06:17,570
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

83
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,130
There was too much going on
on my way here.

84
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,200
Please click "Received".

85
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,050
Here.

86
00:06:22,011 --> 00:06:23,760
The food is still warm.
Really.

87
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,280
Come on.

88
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:27,250
This isn't an easy job.

89
00:06:27,451 --> 00:06:30,039
I have two orders,
but I delivered yours first.

90
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:30,960
Please click "Received".

91
00:06:32,011 --> 00:06:32,811
Please click it.

92
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,931
Hello? The flower garden?

93
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,796
Yes, I'm in the flower garden
in your school.

94
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,496
How many flower gardens
do you have?

95
00:06:41,011 --> 00:06:43,611
I'm in the garden on the east side.
You are the on the west side?

96
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,971
Okay. I'll be right over.

97
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,360
Okay, thank you.

98
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:48,810
You just keep lying.

99
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,209
If you were late,
you could've just admitted it.

100
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,080
I would understand.

101
00:06:52,171 --> 00:06:53,570
I'm sure others would too.

102
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,889
But you are lying through
your teeth right in front of me.

103
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:58,343
Hang on. If you hadn't been
wasting my time, I...

104
00:06:58,424 --> 00:06:59,414
The order is cancelled.

105
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,720
Stop right there!

106
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:06,010
So, you are going to
be unreasonable, huh?

107
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,280
Do you still want it or not?

108
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:09,760
-No.
-No?

109
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,880
Fine. Take this!

110
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:21,410
Coming!

111
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:22,850
I'm almost there!

112
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,280
(Ren Tian Zhen)

113
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:42,410
Are you sure this kid is the one?

114
00:07:42,984 --> 00:07:44,024
I am positive.

115
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,600
I had the same headache as you

116
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,161
when I first got the news.

117
00:07:50,544 --> 00:07:51,344
But

118
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:52,871
didn't you say

119
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,920
education is about

120
00:07:55,011 --> 00:07:56,970
teaching according to one's aptitude,

121
00:07:57,369 --> 00:07:58,649
without discrimination?

122
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,200
So, how?

123
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,240
Can you

124
00:08:03,756 --> 00:08:05,356
turn this kid into

125
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,040
the successor of the sect?

126
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:12,960
Tianquan acu point.

127
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:14,410
Binao acu point.

128
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:16,370
Anterior axillary.

129
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:25,609
What did he order?
It smells so good.

130
00:08:36,171 --> 00:08:37,410
Tian Zhen, are you okay?

131
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:40,211
Did you fall?

132
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:48,931
I should get going.

133
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,480
(Zhao Li Quan)

134
00:08:51,651 --> 00:08:53,204
Don't be late for
your thesis defence.

135
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,657
(Jiangzhou University of
Chinese Medicine Affiliated Hospital)

136
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,080
It's rejected again?

137
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:07,470
I just don't get it.

138
00:09:07,936 --> 00:09:09,616
Why is it so hard

139
00:09:09,931 --> 00:09:12,211
to get things done these days?

140
00:09:12,292 --> 00:09:13,370
Calm down, Shan Dao.

141
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,283
When you encounter a problem,
always remember

142
00:09:15,896 --> 00:09:17,537
to stay neutral and calm.

143
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:20,290
It's been so long.

144
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:21,931
Even God would lost His patience.

145
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,681
This is my bad.

146
00:09:24,104 --> 00:09:26,023
I wanted to hold
a succession programme,

147
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,616
an apprentice training programme.

148
00:09:27,697 --> 00:09:29,456
I brought this trouble to myself.

149
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:33,970
Shao Dao,

150
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,611
the problem of TCM education

151
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,171
in some parts of our country

152
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,720
is becoming more and more obvious.

153
00:09:39,238 --> 00:09:40,238
You see, if we teach

154
00:09:40,611 --> 00:09:43,171
our students using
a Western medical mindset,

155
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,090
our students will use the same
mindset to solve problems.

156
00:09:46,171 --> 00:09:47,731
What is TCM mindset?

157
00:09:48,851 --> 00:09:50,817
We employ teaching
through clinical practice.

158
00:09:50,931 --> 00:09:51,970
So, I believe

159
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:53,771
teacher-apprentice education

160
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,410
in TCM

161
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:56,611
will return.

162
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,613
If a student cannot learn well,

163
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,697
then the problem must lie
with the teaching method.

164
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,520
If a student isn't taught well,

165
00:10:02,556 --> 00:10:03,957
it must be the fault of his master.

166
00:10:14,491 --> 00:10:15,570
Your takeout is here!

167
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,880
Pick up the phone.

168
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:23,656
I will leave it at the door.

169
00:10:31,411 --> 00:10:33,331
Help! Help!

170
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:36,290
Open the door!

171
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:38,104
Open it!

172
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:39,971
Open it!

173
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:41,091
Open it!

174
00:10:42,971 --> 00:10:44,610
Sorry, teachers. I'm probably late.

175
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,450
You are not late.

176
00:10:47,758 --> 00:10:48,638
You are just in time.

177
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:49,530
Thank you.

178
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:56,971
I'm sorry, sir.

179
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,559
What is

180
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,570
the emergency first aid
for an open fracture?

181
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:06,531
The emergency...

182
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,496
The emergency first aid
for an open fracture...

183
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,091
-Do you still want it or not?
-No.

184
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:19,091
Fine. Take this!

185
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,600
Relax. Relax.

186
00:11:23,771 --> 00:11:25,057
It's not a difficult question.

187
00:11:25,531 --> 00:11:26,331
Don't be nervous.

188
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,520
I'm not nervous. I'm angry!

189
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:33,851
Sorry about that.

190
00:11:34,411 --> 00:11:35,971
Can you repeat the question?

191
00:11:36,971 --> 00:11:37,771
Sorry.

192
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:42,851
What is

193
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,946
the emergency first aid
for an open fracture?

194
00:11:48,531 --> 00:11:52,411
Please tell us the emergency treatment
methods for an open fracture.

195
00:12:00,311 --> 00:12:01,119
Help me.

196
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,000
Come back here!

197
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,199
The first step in the emergency
treatment of an open fracture

198
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,920
is to perform life-saving measures.

199
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,200
We should quickly conduct

200
00:12:07,257 --> 00:12:08,657
a comprehensive examination
of the patient.

201
00:12:08,813 --> 00:12:11,840
If a cardiac arrest occurs,
perform a CPR immediately.

202
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,640
Next is to apply dressing
and stop the bleeding.

203
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:16,211
It is important to use clean clothing
for bandaging the wound.

204
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:18,091
The exposed fractured ends

205
00:12:18,091 --> 00:12:19,211
should not be pulled back
into the skin tissue

206
00:12:19,211 --> 00:12:21,210
to avoid potential misdiagnosis
by medical professionals.

207
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:22,531
Thirdly, temporary splinting
is required.

208
00:12:22,851 --> 00:12:25,251
It is important to use
rigid objects for splinting.

209
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,560
The splint

210
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:28,411
should extend beyond the fractured
area by one joint above and below.

211
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,640
Without proper splinting,

212
00:12:29,641 --> 00:12:31,810
the patient or injured limb
should not be moved arbitrarily.

213
00:12:32,091 --> 00:12:32,891
Let go!

214
00:12:33,091 --> 00:12:33,930
Stop fighting!

215
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:34,730
Stop it!

216
00:12:34,971 --> 00:12:36,011
Stop!

217
00:13:06,091 --> 00:13:07,211
These are my answers.

218
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,119
Thank you.

219
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:15,290
Thank you.

220
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:34,571
Ouch.

221
00:13:35,851 --> 00:13:36,730
Be gentle.

222
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:37,960
Thank you.

223
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,470
Why did she hit you?

224
00:13:51,384 --> 00:13:52,784
We didn't give her a good rating.

225
00:13:54,689 --> 00:13:56,790
You hit them just because they
didn't give you a good rating?

226
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,023
Are you sure that's the truth?

227
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:25,730
Madam,

228
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,640
Master.

229
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,600
Master, madam,

230
00:14:40,091 --> 00:14:41,170
I have an idea.

231
00:14:42,038 --> 00:14:43,730
I don't know if it will work.

232
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:46,651
I'd like to organize
a TCM apprentice class.

233
00:14:49,144 --> 00:14:50,651
What is teacher-student succession?

234
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:52,010
How do you want to do it?

235
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,400
I will follow the example
of the ancients,

236
00:14:53,477 --> 00:14:54,548
with teachers guiding students,

237
00:14:54,629 --> 00:14:56,360
let education fosters mutual growth.

238
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:58,851
Talking about this

239
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:00,930
is easy in theory.

240
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,680
But how are you going
to put it into practice?

241
00:15:03,763 --> 00:15:05,203
It's easy to find a teacher.

242
00:15:05,651 --> 00:15:06,810
Over the years,

243
00:15:06,891 --> 00:15:08,730
you've searched for many TCM doctors,

244
00:15:08,851 --> 00:15:09,730
and you've got the ability.

245
00:15:09,851 --> 00:15:11,490
But what about the apprentices?

246
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,969
Are you going to recruit
student from the medical school?

247
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:15,889
Besides,

248
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:18,771
by doing this, you are
going against the school

249
00:15:18,943 --> 00:15:20,011
and setting up a new school.

250
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:20,971
Madam,

251
00:15:21,084 --> 00:15:23,564
the 52nd decree
of the Ministry of Health

252
00:15:23,651 --> 00:15:24,851
explicitly stipulates

253
00:15:25,451 --> 00:15:26,251
that any student

254
00:15:26,411 --> 00:15:28,011
who aspires to learn TCM,

255
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:31,190
with a high school diploma
or equivalent education,

256
00:15:31,851 --> 00:15:34,091
can obtain a medical
practice qualification

257
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,400
by continuously apprenticing

258
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:37,091
with a master for three years

259
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,089
and passing the medical
licensing examination.

260
00:15:39,203 --> 00:15:40,324
Actually, I think

261
00:15:40,851 --> 00:15:42,490
the philosophy of TCM
is about harmony

262
00:15:43,411 --> 00:15:44,211
and assistance,

263
00:15:44,851 --> 00:15:45,651
not resistance.

264
00:15:47,411 --> 00:15:48,851
That's an interesting idea

265
00:15:49,603 --> 00:15:50,404
you've got there.

266
00:15:51,411 --> 00:15:52,291
Easy there.

267
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,199
Please explain clearly
what you mean by "lecturing" first.

268
00:15:56,384 --> 00:15:57,790
I want to conduct an open lecture.

269
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,119
An inclusive education.

270
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,600
Spread the knowledge of TCM.

271
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,839
Spread it?

272
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:02,710
Yes.

273
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:05,851
TCM is not Confucianism.

274
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:08,370
You can't recruit thousands
of disciples like Confucius.

275
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:10,651
TCM has existed for thousands of years.

276
00:16:10,851 --> 00:16:13,091
The greatest fear is that it will
be passed on to the wrong people.

277
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,495
It will ruin its spirit.

278
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,720
And you want to pass on
the knowledge to more people,

279
00:16:15,803 --> 00:16:17,851
if someone with ill intentions

280
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,600
uses these knowledge

281
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:20,730
for wrongdoing

282
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:22,170
and gains unjust gains,

283
00:16:22,403 --> 00:16:23,370
what should we do then?

284
00:16:23,597 --> 00:16:24,638
Madam,

285
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:26,043
integrity

286
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,600
is the way of nature.

287
00:16:28,091 --> 00:16:30,411
The principle of nature is to be
honest and never deceive.

288
00:16:31,411 --> 00:16:33,511
As long as a person
possesses integrity and honesty,

289
00:16:33,771 --> 00:16:35,930
they will not betray
the precious knowledge of TCM.

290
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:38,170
If one doesn't understand
this principle,

291
00:16:38,651 --> 00:16:40,411
even if you give them a gold mine,

292
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,720
they won't be able
to make money from it.

293
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:44,050
Isn't that what the legendary painter,
Ma Liang, said?

294
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:47,970
You are a university president.

295
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:50,170
Managing a school

296
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:51,971
is already challenging enough.

297
00:16:52,091 --> 00:16:53,091
Why choose

298
00:16:53,091 --> 00:16:54,651
to walk this path?

299
00:16:55,476 --> 00:16:56,396
You see,

300
00:16:56,477 --> 00:16:57,357
I

301
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:00,411
have spent half of my life teaching.

302
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:01,810
I have taught

303
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:03,891
many practising doctors,

304
00:17:04,971 --> 00:17:06,771
but there are still too many patients,

305
00:17:06,771 --> 00:17:08,651
and they will never stop coming.

306
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:12,211
In fact, we are focusing too much
on the superficial aspects

307
00:17:12,683 --> 00:17:14,344
and neglecting the essence of TCM.

308
00:17:14,944 --> 00:17:15,984
The essence of TCM lies in

309
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:20,690
the prevention and treatment
of illnesses before they manifest.

310
00:17:21,056 --> 00:17:22,537
The highest level of medical practice
focuses on preventing diseases,

311
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,411
middle-level physicians
treat potential illnesses,

312
00:17:24,411 --> 00:17:26,651
and lower-level physicians
treat existing diseases.

313
00:17:27,091 --> 00:17:28,531
We ourselves are considered
lower-level physicians,

314
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,011
and the students we teach

315
00:17:30,331 --> 00:17:31,570
also fall into that category.

316
00:17:32,571 --> 00:17:33,651
We have not fully demonstrated

317
00:17:33,732 --> 00:17:35,011
the characteristics of TCM.

318
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:38,759
My biggest dream is to

319
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,480
spread the knowledge of TCM

320
00:17:40,571 --> 00:17:42,372
to every household.

321
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:43,730
Nip the illness

322
00:17:44,524 --> 00:17:45,564
in the bud.

323
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:48,771
I was thinking that

324
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:50,451
I might even

325
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,130
nurture another genius like

326
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:53,851
Chang Sang or Bian Que,

327
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:56,331
I would be able to honour
my predecessors then.

328
00:17:57,531 --> 00:17:59,370
That's quite a confident statement.

329
00:17:59,451 --> 00:18:00,451
Good.

330
00:18:00,851 --> 00:18:03,411
He is on his path
to achieve great things,

331
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:04,771
please don't be a monster

332
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,520
that blocks his way.

333
00:18:06,597 --> 00:18:07,756
You are the monster.

334
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:10,490
Madam,

335
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:12,050
I've made up my mind.

336
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:14,051
Spreading the knowledge of TCM

337
00:18:14,643 --> 00:18:16,604
is my responsibility and ideal.

338
00:18:17,451 --> 00:18:18,930
Today, TCM has lost

339
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:20,531
its ancient methods

340
00:18:20,882 --> 00:18:22,403
of self-preservation.

341
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,921
If it loses the foundation
of self-health,

342
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,343
then TCM has truly reached

343
00:18:26,424 --> 00:18:28,964
a state of forgetting its roots

344
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:31,091
and is in a precarious situation.

345
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,700
(Song Yi Ren, Zhang Ji Ru)

346
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:37,971
Therefore, I want to

347
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,201
explore

348
00:18:41,691 --> 00:18:45,210
the traditional model of
teacher-apprentice education

349
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,039
to test it out.

350
00:18:50,651 --> 00:18:51,651
Do you know

351
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:53,383
it's against the law to hit someone?

352
00:18:53,843 --> 00:18:54,723
I know.

353
00:18:56,809 --> 00:18:58,049
But a scumbag like him,

354
00:18:58,931 --> 00:19:00,531
I will beat him up again if I see him.

355
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,680
Are you serious?

356
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:05,090
You broke his arm.

357
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:06,797
He can have his injuries assessed now.

358
00:19:06,923 --> 00:19:08,163
If he wants to sue you,

359
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:10,171
you... You will have to go to jail.

360
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:15,576
This is an interrogation.

361
00:19:17,124 --> 00:19:17,924
Sit straight.

362
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:18,920
Hang on.

363
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:20,920
So...

364
00:19:21,691 --> 00:19:23,291
What does that mean?

365
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,560
When I encounter a situation
like this again,

366
00:19:24,641 --> 00:19:26,241
should I just leave it alone?

367
00:19:26,436 --> 00:19:27,836
You called the police.

368
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,000
Why didn't you wait until
we were there to solve it?

369
00:19:30,051 --> 00:19:31,210
I waited for you.

370
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,651
But the situation
didn't allow me to wait.

371
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,906
You should have just waited.

372
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:37,210
What if we happened
to be on patrol there?

373
00:19:37,411 --> 00:19:38,211
Right?

374
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,721
Seriously you,

375
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:41,811
this isn't the first time.

376
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,160
You have good intentions,

377
00:19:43,243 --> 00:19:44,504
but you always end up
getting yourself in trouble.

378
00:19:44,585 --> 00:19:45,385
Last time,

379
00:19:45,777 --> 00:19:46,786
you were being kind too.

380
00:19:47,029 --> 00:19:48,990
And what happened to you?
You got scammed.

381
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,199
Can't you learn your lesson?

382
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,600
What's wrong?

383
00:20:01,997 --> 00:20:02,997
He injured you?

384
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:05,571
Let's see. Where is it hurt?

385
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:06,371
Where does it hurt?

386
00:20:07,531 --> 00:20:09,010
Hurry. Sit up. Let me check.

387
00:20:09,411 --> 00:20:10,211
I'm hungry.

388
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:14,291
Do you have food for me?

389
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:20,450
Do you have food for me?

390
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:23,530
Thank you, madam.

391
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:26,051
What are you talking about?
You seem so happy.

392
00:20:29,571 --> 00:20:30,811
Master, madam,

393
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Shao Dao said

394
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:33,370
he has found the direct descendant

395
00:20:33,411 --> 00:20:36,492
of the Jiang family's acupuncture sect.

396
00:20:39,411 --> 00:20:41,051
Really? Where is he?

397
00:20:41,811 --> 00:20:42,931
What kind of person is he?

398
00:20:43,051 --> 00:20:44,090
She is a young girl.

399
00:20:44,556 --> 00:20:45,757
About 20 years old.

400
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:48,531
20 years old.

401
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,959
That means she is in college?

402
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:50,840
No.

403
00:20:51,171 --> 00:20:52,051
She isn't studying.

404
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,680
What does she do then?

405
00:20:56,571 --> 00:20:57,651
Shao Dao said

406
00:20:57,904 --> 00:21:00,223
her biological father is unknown.

407
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:02,450
During the year of the major flood,

408
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,970
her mother sacrificed herself
while trying to save others.

409
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,281
The girl

410
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,130
almost died too.

411
00:21:09,531 --> 00:21:10,850
She was barely breathing

412
00:21:11,171 --> 00:21:12,850
when she was discovered.

413
00:21:13,443 --> 00:21:14,644
She had been living in

414
00:21:14,931 --> 00:21:17,130
an orphanage after that.

415
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:21,183
She left the orphanage and
entered society when she was 18.

416
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:24,970
Can Wu Shan Dao's words be trusted?

417
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:27,771
He'd better not deceive you
with a random person.

418
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,720
That's right.

419
00:21:28,811 --> 00:21:30,891
You are prejudiced against Shan Dao.

420
00:21:31,571 --> 00:21:32,371
I...

421
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:35,051
I read her profile.

422
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,801
Her mother and the ancestral master

423
00:21:37,063 --> 00:21:38,624
took a photo together.

424
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,877
Although it has been a long time,

425
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:42,930
I could still see

426
00:21:43,216 --> 00:21:44,216
the resemblance

427
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:45,497
between her facial features

428
00:21:45,691 --> 00:21:47,210
and this girl.

429
00:21:47,651 --> 00:21:49,772
-Really?
-Her mother was

430
00:21:49,931 --> 00:21:50,931
a TCM doctor like us.

431
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,761
I have the photo here.

432
00:21:59,811 --> 00:22:00,691
Let me see.

433
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:03,051
She looks like a clever girl.

434
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:13,450
My master told me

435
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:14,931
that our acupuncture lineage,

436
00:22:15,571 --> 00:22:16,730
and the Jiang family's
acupuncture technique

437
00:22:17,051 --> 00:22:18,411
share the same origin.

438
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:21,330
The various successors
are interconnected

439
00:22:21,811 --> 00:22:23,090
as teachers and students.

440
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:27,324
He learned our family's
acupuncture technique

441
00:22:27,411 --> 00:22:30,210
from the Jiang family.

442
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:34,090
The Jiang family's
tenth-generation successor

443
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,623
was highly skilled in medicine.

444
00:22:36,136 --> 00:22:37,977
And he cared about the world.

445
00:22:38,411 --> 00:22:39,691
During the Anti-Japanese War,

446
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:42,730
he treated numerous patients using
the acupuncture techniques

447
00:22:42,931 --> 00:22:44,850
of the Jiang family.

448
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:46,210
As you all know,

449
00:22:46,571 --> 00:22:49,210
during times of war,
medical resources were scarce.

450
00:22:49,411 --> 00:22:50,211
However,

451
00:22:50,646 --> 00:22:52,846
he was able to provide
medical assistance to people

452
00:22:53,051 --> 00:22:54,931
using just a tiny silver needle.

453
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,359
This is a very remarkable thing.

454
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,080
You don't say.

455
00:23:00,691 --> 00:23:03,490
From what I can see, even though
this child hasn't had much education,

456
00:23:04,403 --> 00:23:05,604
but from her facial features,

457
00:23:06,164 --> 00:23:08,230
there is a noble and
virtuous aura about her.

458
00:23:08,531 --> 00:23:10,450
She came out to work after 18.

459
00:23:10,884 --> 00:23:12,531
She must have finished high school then.

460
00:23:12,931 --> 00:23:14,637
Since she has finished high school,

461
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,078
she's considered a scholar.

462
00:23:16,639 --> 00:23:19,319
It shouldn't be difficult
for a scholar to learn medicine.

463
00:23:20,291 --> 00:23:21,330
Is she a good person?

464
00:23:21,811 --> 00:23:22,730
That's what matters.

465
00:23:22,811 --> 00:23:23,772
Yes, Master.

466
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:25,811
I will try to learn more about her.

467
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:26,931
I'm home.

468
00:23:27,691 --> 00:23:28,571
You're home.

469
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:30,111
Let's have dinner.

470
00:23:34,051 --> 00:23:35,250
Did you pass the exam?

471
00:23:35,411 --> 00:23:36,211
I did.

472
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,479
That's good.

473
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,620
You know how you
passed your exam, right?

474
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,331
What is the emergency
first aid for an open fracture?

475
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:53,343
Please tell us the emergency treatment
methods for an open fracture.

476
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,610
You can't rely on
family connection forever.

477
00:23:55,691 --> 00:23:57,330
When you enter the workplace,

478
00:23:57,856 --> 00:23:59,670
you will have to rely on
your own abilities.

479
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,001
I didn't need their help at all.

480
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,516
Now you are being ungrateful.

481
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,360
Everyone in the room saw that

482
00:24:08,436 --> 00:24:09,676
you paused for 30 seconds.

483
00:24:12,931 --> 00:24:15,349
Did you want Professor Su to
perform a dumb show with you?

484
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:21,960
Sit down.

485
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:27,210
Your dad can't even
lecture you a little?

486
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:29,691
You are unbelievable.

487
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,320
It's a day worth celebrating.

488
00:24:32,051 --> 00:24:33,490
Don't talk about family connection.

489
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,279
Why couldn't you see
he had been working hard?

490
00:24:37,931 --> 00:24:38,931
Just eat your dinner.

491
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,120
Let's eat. Let's drop it.

492
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:44,370
Dad, have some of this.

493
00:24:44,411 --> 00:24:45,411
Have a chicken wing.

494
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:48,250
By the way,

495
00:24:48,651 --> 00:24:50,171
I was just about to ask you,

496
00:24:50,963 --> 00:24:53,723
what are you wearing?

497
00:24:55,396 --> 00:24:57,531
Weren't you required to wear formal
for your exam?

498
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,120
Where is your suit?

499
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,231
And you're wearing red with green.

500
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:03,571
You don't take anything seriously.

501
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,520
(Song Ling Lan)

502
00:25:53,429 --> 00:25:54,229
Grandpa,

503
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,970
eating and drinking in moderation.

504
00:25:56,051 --> 00:25:57,330
You are a TCM doctor yourself.

505
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:59,370
Look what you are eating.

506
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,320
These are unhealthy.

507
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:06,330
Humans have desires.

508
00:26:07,038 --> 00:26:09,597
Having a craving for food is
what makes us human.

509
00:26:10,276 --> 00:26:11,757
Your father is not human.

510
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:13,651
You are insulting Dad.

511
00:26:13,811 --> 00:26:14,811
I have to tell him.

512
00:26:15,051 --> 00:26:16,811
Your father is not a man,

513
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,800
but a god from heaven.

514
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:22,330
I'm complimenting him.

515
00:26:22,531 --> 00:26:23,331
He is a god.

516
00:26:23,571 --> 00:26:24,691
He's better than me.

517
00:26:32,531 --> 00:26:33,411
Ignore

518
00:26:34,296 --> 00:26:36,216
the family pressure.

519
00:26:36,531 --> 00:26:37,730
You can't be your father.

520
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:39,450
Just be yourself.

521
00:26:39,817 --> 00:26:40,897
No one

522
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:42,651
can become your father.

523
00:26:43,291 --> 00:26:49,160
Your parents raised you
according to the standards of an heir.

524
00:26:49,257 --> 00:26:50,811
I just want you

525
00:26:51,023 --> 00:26:52,383
to be happy.

526
00:26:52,464 --> 00:26:54,344
It doesn't matter
if you'll be an heir or not.

527
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:57,850
Look at me, I handed over
the medical centre to your dad early.

528
00:26:58,051 --> 00:26:59,571
I don't want to live a life

529
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:01,309
without human desire,

530
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:03,437
where I'm not even allowed
to eat an ice cream.

531
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:09,250
All right.

532
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,640
Also,

533
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,490
all those who were testing you today
were my students.

534
00:27:15,571 --> 00:27:17,850
I know what they are capable of.

535
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,440
They weren't as good as you.

536
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:22,651
I helped them back then.

537
00:27:23,651 --> 00:27:24,451
Now,

538
00:27:24,571 --> 00:27:25,691
they are helping you.

539
00:27:26,291 --> 00:27:27,091
This is called

540
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:29,011
repaying the favour.

541
00:27:31,171 --> 00:27:31,971
All right.

542
00:27:34,291 --> 00:27:38,450
With my grandson's
exceptional intelligence,

543
00:27:38,623 --> 00:27:40,691
quick thinking,

544
00:27:40,772 --> 00:27:42,850
diligence,

545
00:27:43,051 --> 00:27:44,691
and eagerness to learn,

546
00:27:45,291 --> 00:27:47,931
he can easily pass the exam

547
00:27:48,571 --> 00:27:51,651
with his own abilities.

548
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:53,291
Come.

549
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:56,130
Drink with me.

550
00:27:57,691 --> 00:27:58,531
Grandpa, Grandpa,

551
00:27:59,931 --> 00:28:00,931
this is yours.

552
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,880
Junior Ren,

553
00:28:08,156 --> 00:28:09,556
this is uncool of you.

554
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,129
You are burning the bridge
after crossing the river.

555
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:13,411
Senior Song,

556
00:28:13,811 --> 00:28:15,970
you'd better drink as much as you can

557
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:18,051
before I snitch on you to
Mum and Grandma.

558
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:20,010
This...

559
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:29,416
This is the wine from
the ancient town of Dongpu, Shaoxing.

560
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,679
18 years old.

561
00:28:36,531 --> 00:28:39,291
This wine has been buried under
the osmanthus tree for 18 years.

562
00:28:40,171 --> 00:28:42,931
Its essence is filled with the fragrance
of osmanthus flowers.

563
00:28:44,171 --> 00:28:45,171
It enters the lungs.

564
00:28:46,171 --> 00:28:46,971
It enters the liver.

565
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:54,530
I'm good, aren't I?

566
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:57,850
You really are my grandson.

567
00:28:58,977 --> 00:28:59,937
Your sense of colour,

568
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:03,691
taste, and smell are excellent.

569
00:29:07,571 --> 00:29:09,970
-Grandpa, don't play tricks.
-I just want a sip.

570
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:11,210
No, no.

571
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:12,730
Grandpa, cut it down.

572
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,080
Grandpa...

573
00:29:15,931 --> 00:29:17,730
Mum and Grandma are going to spank me.

574
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:19,291
It's so good.

575
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:21,370
So good.

576
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,599
Shao Dao.

577
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:29,880
(Xin Zheng,)

578
00:29:30,083 --> 00:29:30,884
(I can't)

579
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:32,670
get her back for you.

580
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:34,857
(Who?)

581
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,879
The successor.

582
00:29:42,571 --> 00:29:45,090
Her action should be
considered to be an act of justice.

583
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:46,817
Yes.

584
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,543
This girl has got a heroic spirit.

585
00:29:49,751 --> 00:29:50,911
It's not the first time

586
00:29:51,171 --> 00:29:52,291
the man has hit his sister.

587
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,760
He even fractured her patella

588
00:29:54,811 --> 00:29:55,691
last time.

589
00:29:56,171 --> 00:29:57,090
Why?

590
00:29:58,143 --> 00:30:00,217
He got these bad habits
from the street.

591
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,080
He asked his sister for money
every now and then.

592
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,210
His sister even got divorced
because of this.

593
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,320
Based on your experience,

594
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:14,030
how much does
she need to compensate him?

595
00:30:14,691 --> 00:30:15,491
It's hard to say.

596
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,893
It's probably going to
cost her a lot of money.

597
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:21,850
This guy won't settle
unless he gets money.

598
00:30:23,291 --> 00:30:24,330
All right. It's okay.

599
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:25,411
I will

600
00:30:26,936 --> 00:30:27,936
talk to them.

601
00:30:28,396 --> 00:30:29,997
How is this girl related to you?

602
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:31,116
Why are you helping her?

603
00:30:32,651 --> 00:30:33,451
She is my

604
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,601
senior aunt.

605
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,760
100,000 yuan?

606
00:30:42,691 --> 00:30:45,531
Have you ever brought home
100,000 yuan?

607
00:30:46,104 --> 00:30:47,490
Now you are asking me

608
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:49,010
to pay that money for a stranger.

609
00:30:49,417 --> 00:30:50,730
She's not a stranger.

610
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,040
She is your senior aunt.

611
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,840
You always found random strangers

612
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:56,051
and told me

613
00:30:56,051 --> 00:30:58,291
they were my senior uncle
or senior master.

614
00:30:58,531 --> 00:31:00,210
How many unrelated Senior Uncles

615
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:01,571
have you introduced me now?

616
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,000
Sweetie, watch your words.

617
00:31:04,291 --> 00:31:05,651
You have to pay back

618
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,453
for all the wrong things you say.

619
00:31:08,176 --> 00:31:09,257
I'm telling the truth.

620
00:31:09,903 --> 00:31:10,864
What did I say wrong?

621
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:14,960
Speak.

622
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,369
Even if she really is our senior aunt,

623
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:18,651
given her disposition,

624
00:31:18,651 --> 00:31:19,651
are you sure
you can turn her into a TCM doctor?

625
00:31:19,785 --> 00:31:20,839
It took decades for you

626
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,400
and my grandfather's generation
to transform TCM practitioners

627
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:25,991
from rural doctors to official doctors
with master's degrees.

628
00:31:26,297 --> 00:31:29,291
Our industry is on thin ice today.

629
00:31:29,884 --> 00:31:31,963
If we recruit someone
who went to jail, won't it...

630
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:36,370
From the information given by

631
00:31:36,604 --> 00:31:38,364
your senior uncle, Wu Shan Dao,

632
00:31:38,531 --> 00:31:40,571
if this girl is really a descendant

633
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,520
of the Jiang family's acupuncture sect,

634
00:31:42,777 --> 00:31:45,497
she has gone into jail a few times
at such young age,

635
00:31:45,738 --> 00:31:47,137
if we don't pull her back
from the wrong path,

636
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,801
then the Jiang family's acupuncture sect

637
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,640
will really have fallen.

638
00:31:51,291 --> 00:31:52,771
From a moral standpoint,

639
00:31:53,851 --> 00:31:56,603
the Jiang family's acupuncture sect
has contributed to the nation.

640
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:58,531
From a personal reason,

641
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,097
we are indebted to
the Jiang family's acupuncture sect.

642
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:03,630
So, we have to save her.

643
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,039
How do you know that
she can be guided and educated?

644
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,840
Even for someone
as unteachable as you,

645
00:32:07,904 --> 00:32:08,904
we have not given up.

646
00:32:14,302 --> 00:32:15,383
I will pay

647
00:32:15,691 --> 00:32:16,491
this 100,000 yuan.

648
00:32:17,618 --> 00:32:18,938
Bail your senior aunt out.

649
00:32:21,238 --> 00:32:22,038
Mum,

650
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:23,610
my dad has kept a secret stash?

651
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,601
I will pay it.

652
00:32:33,691 --> 00:32:35,051
A young girl like you

653
00:32:35,291 --> 00:32:37,084
shouldn't resort to
violence all the time.

654
00:32:37,691 --> 00:32:39,051
You got lucky this time.

655
00:32:39,571 --> 00:32:40,877
They decided to drop the charge.

656
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,319
Will you be this lucky next time?

657
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,361
Will you please
stay away from trouble?

658
00:32:45,677 --> 00:32:46,477
Are you listening?

659
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,016
I finished the report.

660
00:32:54,651 --> 00:32:55,811
He's waiting for you outside.

661
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:57,691
Who?

662
00:33:34,931 --> 00:33:35,731
You...

663
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,533
You are the one who bailed me out?

664
00:33:37,984 --> 00:33:38,784
That's right.

665
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:40,731
I bailed you out.

666
00:33:41,291 --> 00:33:42,610
Have...

667
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:44,411
Have we met before?

668
00:33:44,531 --> 00:33:46,090
I don't remember you.

669
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,663
We've never met before.

670
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,519
Then why?

671
00:33:50,051 --> 00:33:50,851
No reason.

672
00:33:52,811 --> 00:33:53,931
Let me ask you,

673
00:33:54,291 --> 00:33:55,411
what are

674
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,760
your future plans?

675
00:33:58,470 --> 00:33:59,950
My future plans?

676
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:04,270
I will just figure things out
as I go along.

677
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,360
If I may suggest,

678
00:34:07,664 --> 00:34:08,670
learn medicine from me.

679
00:34:09,931 --> 00:34:10,811
Learn TCM.

680
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:16,330
I didn't even finish
primary school, sir.

681
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:17,130
I looked into you.

682
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:18,576
You finished high school.

683
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:21,651
Who are you?

684
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:24,523
What organization are you from?

685
00:34:24,683 --> 00:34:25,483
This...

686
00:34:25,651 --> 00:34:26,895
We are in the police station.

687
00:34:29,757 --> 00:34:30,676
You are a good man.

688
00:34:30,757 --> 00:34:32,077
I met a good man.

689
00:34:32,568 --> 00:34:34,009
All right then. Thank you.

690
00:34:34,149 --> 00:34:35,470
If that's all, I should go.

691
00:34:45,651 --> 00:34:46,651
Do you have a car?

692
00:34:49,651 --> 00:34:51,250
-What do you mean?
-Did you drive here?

693
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,811
My scooter isn't here.

694
00:34:55,011 --> 00:34:55,811
Could you

695
00:34:56,450 --> 00:34:58,771
give me a ride
if it is convenient for you?

696
00:34:59,291 --> 00:35:00,091
Let's go.

697
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:10,490
Where are you going?

698
00:35:12,651 --> 00:35:13,451
College town.

699
00:35:13,811 --> 00:35:14,771
Why are you going there?

700
00:35:15,730 --> 00:35:16,691
I'm studying there.

701
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,481
I'm applying for a chef job
at the food street

702
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,880
in college town.

703
00:35:24,011 --> 00:35:25,691
I will get paid 4,800 yuan per month.

704
00:35:25,771 --> 00:35:26,730
I'm working there.

705
00:35:27,571 --> 00:35:28,704
You are looking for a job?

706
00:35:28,811 --> 00:35:29,910
You should come with me.

707
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:31,450
100 yuan a day.

708
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,649
You will get paid
at the end of the day.

709
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:35,210
If you don't want to do it,
you can leave anytime you want.

710
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,920
Do you have children?

711
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,640
A son.

712
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:42,330
How is your health?

713
00:35:42,691 --> 00:35:43,491
It's good.

714
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,303
But I'm not as robust as you.

715
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,267
Are you looking for a kidney?

716
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,840
What kind of people
are you dealing with every day?

717
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:57,290
Okay.

718
00:35:58,011 --> 00:35:59,011
That's fast.

719
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:02,291
I still can't figure out
what's going on inside your head.

720
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,731
Do I have to pay tuition fees?

721
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,216
We provide food, accommodation
and salary.

722
00:36:07,771 --> 00:36:09,131
That sounds like a good deal.

723
00:36:11,571 --> 00:36:14,051
Why did you choose me
for such a good offer?

724
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:16,730
If it were up to me,

725
00:36:17,571 --> 00:36:19,091
I wouldn't have chosen you.

726
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:21,450
But God has chosen you.

727
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:25,250
God?

728
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:28,011
What does that mean?

729
00:36:31,011 --> 00:36:31,811
Look.

730
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:33,531
I'm taking you to a place.

731
00:36:34,011 --> 00:36:35,210
When you get there,

732
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:36,611
whatever I say,

733
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:37,650
you don't say anything.

734
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:38,690
Can you do it?

735
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:42,531
No matter what happens,
I can't say anything?

736
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:43,530
That's right.

737
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:45,910
Just sit there and stay silent
no matter what happens.

738
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:02,730
This...

739
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,360
What's wrong?

740
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:05,250
So many...

741
00:37:07,011 --> 00:37:07,811
What are you doing?

742
00:37:11,051 --> 00:37:11,851
Hang on.

743
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,081
What is this place?

744
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,950
Why are there
so many people in white...

745
00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:19,530
From now on, your lips

746
00:37:19,811 --> 00:37:20,811
are zipped.

747
00:37:29,011 --> 00:37:30,091
Why are you so tense?

748
00:37:31,531 --> 00:37:32,331
Listen,

749
00:37:32,911 --> 00:37:34,191
I don't want to do anything bad.

750
00:37:36,811 --> 00:37:38,250
I'm talking to you.

751
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:40,490
Pay me first.

752
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,640
Why are you taking out your phone?

753
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,571
I thought you were
going to pay me.

754
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,480
Transfer it to me.

755
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:51,210
Don't dawdle. Hurry up.

756
00:38:01,091 --> 00:38:02,011
Cash?

757
00:38:03,571 --> 00:38:06,210
-Do you want it or not?
-Are you serious?

758
00:38:06,331 --> 00:38:08,291
People are still
using cash these days?

759
00:38:15,250 --> 00:38:16,050
Come on.

760
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:20,170
Let me say it again.

761
00:38:20,309 --> 00:38:21,910
I don't do bad things.

762
00:38:22,163 --> 00:38:23,210
I won't do anything

763
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:24,490
that is unethical and illegal.

764
00:38:24,676 --> 00:38:26,650
Don't forget

765
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,120
who just bailed you out.

766
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:29,410
I wasn't arrested

767
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:31,051
because I did something bad.

768
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:32,291
You got it?

769
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,839
I'm very pure at heart.

770
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,899
After all, I have also received
nine years of compulsory education.

771
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:41,569
I'm not one of those
who slipped through the cracks.

772
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:42,637
When I was in school...

773
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:21,350
(Qibo Medical Centre)

774
00:39:23,911 --> 00:39:24,919
I'd like to

775
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,079
introduce to you
a new colleague today.

776
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:30,160
In terms of seniority, she is my elder,
and your elder.

777
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,520
Her name is...

778
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:40,930
What's your name again?

779
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,040
Your name?

780
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:45,210
Sun Tou Tou.

781
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:48,880
Sun Tou Tou.

782
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,020
"Tou" as in testing the waters?

783
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,561
How do you write that?

784
00:39:55,011 --> 00:39:55,811
Hang on.

785
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,640
It slipped my mind just now.

786
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:00,490
Her name is Sun Tou Tou.

787
00:40:00,877 --> 00:40:01,837
Her name should mean

788
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,599
intellectual and eloquence.

789
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:05,410
Who named you?

790
00:40:07,011 --> 00:40:08,250
The director of the orphanage.

791
00:40:10,811 --> 00:40:11,771
Sit here.

792
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:13,291
-Hang on. I...
-Sit here.

793
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,091
-What is this place?
-Sit here.

794
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:20,250
Her name is Sun Tou Tou.

795
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,079
She grew up in an orphanage.

796
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:26,084
Although she grew up in an orphanage,

797
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,041
she is not

798
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,440
a rootless duckling.

799
00:40:30,811 --> 00:40:31,970
Over the years,

800
00:40:33,084 --> 00:40:34,590
my master has invested
a great deal of effort

801
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:36,331
in searching for her.

802
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,160
In doing so, he has also fulfilled

803
00:40:38,291 --> 00:40:40,250
the wishes of
her family and ancestors.

804
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,280
So, today,

805
00:40:42,296 --> 00:40:44,057
with you all as her witness,

806
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:48,039
Sun Tou Tou has finally been
reconnected with her ancestral roots.

807
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,440
Pay respect

808
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:08,589
to your ancestors.

809
00:41:44,771 --> 00:41:45,811
I've paid my respect.

810
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:55,011
Who are my ancestors?

811
00:41:56,183 --> 00:41:59,170
These people in white robes
are staring at me. It's scary.

812
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:08,250
Sun Tou Tou is the successor of the
Jiang family's acupuncture sect,

813
00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:10,771
which is one of the sects
of TCM acupuncture.

814
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,200
Her mother

815
00:42:13,424 --> 00:42:15,023
passed away at an early age

816
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,680
while trying to save someone.

817
00:42:16,776 --> 00:42:18,936
She was an amazing person.

818
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:22,600
Her family is also known
for their strong sense of justice.

819
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,320
Although Sun Tou Tou

820
00:42:24,331 --> 00:42:26,851
has not received
professional training in TCM,

821
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:29,531
she came from
a well respected family.

822
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:31,410
She is blessed.

823
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,401
Plus me

824
00:42:33,776 --> 00:42:34,736
and everyone here,

825
00:42:35,677 --> 00:42:37,036
we help the weak.

826
00:42:38,011 --> 00:42:39,611
I am sure

827
00:42:39,924 --> 00:42:41,843
that Sun Tou Tou will
become the successor

828
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:43,831
of the Jiang family's
acupuncture technique soon.

829
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:47,839
Sun Tou Tou and

830
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,960
my master, Song Yi Ren,

831
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,640
are peers.

832
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:53,291
So,

833
00:42:54,364 --> 00:42:56,644
I'm supposed
to call her Senior Aunt.

834
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,880
So, by right,

835
00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:01,450
she is

836
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,040
your senior master.

837
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,721
So, now,

838
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:05,790
please

839
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:08,256
pay respect to your senior master.

840
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:12,690
Tou Tou,

841
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,641
by seniority,

842
00:43:15,091 --> 00:43:16,424
you have a higher rank than me,

843
00:43:16,811 --> 00:43:18,324
but I have inherited the legacy of

844
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:19,970
TCM acupuncture.

845
00:43:20,051 --> 00:43:23,051
So, you and I are peers.

846
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:24,250
Starting today,

847
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,930
you are learning TCM from me.

848
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:28,881
So, you should call me Master.

849
00:43:29,051 --> 00:43:29,930
So, I'm not going

850
00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:31,690
to bow to you here.

851
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,479
This is my wife,

852
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:34,890
Song Ling Lan.

853
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,161
She is also
a fellow TCM practitioner.

854
00:43:37,629 --> 00:43:40,510
She will led everyone
to bow in tribute to you,

855
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:43,331
the representative
of Jiang family's acupuncture sect

856
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:44,759
and your family,

857
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:46,730
for their contributions

858
00:43:47,417 --> 00:43:48,217
to the TCM industry.

859
00:44:00,291 --> 00:44:01,891
Dad, Mum, sorry, I'm late.

860
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:05,360
Tian Zhen, bow to her.

861
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:14,981
(The prescriptions and remedies

862
00:44:15,061 --> 00:44:16,403
