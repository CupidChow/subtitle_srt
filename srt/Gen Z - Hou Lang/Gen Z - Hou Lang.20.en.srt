1
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,920
(Gen Z)

2
00:01:35,734 --> 00:01:37,734
(Episode 20)

3
00:01:40,097 --> 00:01:41,137
When we stay at home

4
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:43,618
during our off days,

5
00:01:45,737 --> 00:01:46,897
we chat

6
00:01:47,136 --> 00:01:47,977
(and eat together.)

7
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,480
(When I come back late
from my night shift,)

8
00:01:50,578 --> 00:01:52,308
(he would wait for me
in that little alley.)

9
00:01:52,389 --> 00:01:53,629
(It's really heart-warming.)

10
00:01:54,538 --> 00:01:56,778
(But every time I have
this kind of thought,)

11
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,279
I pull myself back.

12
00:01:59,977 --> 00:02:00,777
I...

13
00:02:02,436 --> 00:02:03,236
I can't.

14
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,919
I can't choose him.

15
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:10,297
Because of his family background.

16
00:02:10,977 --> 00:02:12,337
If I choose to be with him,

17
00:02:13,098 --> 00:02:15,018
I'll be carrying a burden
for a lifetime.

18
00:02:15,378 --> 00:02:16,697
When I'm alone,

19
00:02:16,777 --> 00:02:17,898
I'm paddling a boat alone.

20
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,320
It's already tiring enough.

21
00:02:19,418 --> 00:02:21,218
I don't plan to tie myself down
with a rope.

22
00:02:22,858 --> 00:02:25,098
Why... Why are you
looking at me like that?

23
00:02:25,297 --> 00:02:27,337
I'm not a vain person.

24
00:02:27,497 --> 00:02:29,538
I just don't want
too many responsibilities.

25
00:02:31,098 --> 00:02:32,698
I think if being together with him

26
00:02:33,297 --> 00:02:34,337
is exhausting,

27
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:35,730
I'd rather be alone.

28
00:02:37,617 --> 00:02:38,858
Being together with someone

29
00:02:39,178 --> 00:02:41,204
at least offers more solutions
than being alone.

30
00:02:41,657 --> 00:02:42,738
Not to mention

31
00:02:43,418 --> 00:02:44,738
that he's a pretty nice guy.

32
00:02:45,138 --> 00:02:46,418
He decocted medicine for you.

33
00:02:46,857 --> 00:02:47,978
I can get that delivered

34
00:02:48,058 --> 00:02:49,177
by paying ten yuan.

35
00:02:49,257 --> 00:02:51,017
That's not enough
to trade for my lifelong happiness.

36
00:02:51,097 --> 00:02:54,417
Lifelong happiness is achieved
through the joint efforts of two people.

37
00:02:57,058 --> 00:02:59,378
I'm telling you,
Zhao Li Quan is quite hard-working.

38
00:03:00,418 --> 00:03:01,218
I mean it.

39
00:03:02,178 --> 00:03:03,657
I think he will

40
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,480
make achievement within a few years.

41
00:03:05,577 --> 00:03:08,578
He may even become
a self-made man, right?

42
00:03:09,537 --> 00:03:10,617
Be patient with him.

43
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:13,577
But then again,

44
00:03:15,068 --> 00:03:16,537
I think the most important thing is

45
00:03:17,058 --> 00:03:17,897
whether

46
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:19,898
you really

47
00:03:20,738 --> 00:03:21,657
like him or not.

48
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,040
I think love is a luxury for me.

49
00:03:31,458 --> 00:03:32,458
And I can't afford it.

50
00:03:34,178 --> 00:03:34,978
Tian Xing Xing,

51
00:03:35,857 --> 00:03:38,418
I never realised you placed
such importance on conditions.

52
00:03:38,656 --> 00:03:40,136
If you value conditions so much,

53
00:03:40,217 --> 00:03:41,338
there's a saying that opportunities
favour those who are near.

54
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,120
Why don't you look for one
in your own hospital?

55
00:03:43,217 --> 00:03:44,417
I would love to find one,

56
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,017
but who would be interested in me?

57
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,400
The people who joined our hospital
are all PhD holders.

58
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:50,250
They are the cream of the crop.

59
00:03:50,577 --> 00:03:53,098
They are considered rare resources
in the eyes of local women.

60
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,640
So, why would they want to choose
someone from another city like me?

61
00:03:55,738 --> 00:03:57,737
This city has a chain of contempt.

62
00:03:58,258 --> 00:03:59,258
That's why

63
00:03:59,417 --> 00:04:01,898
men can't find partners,
and women can't find partners either.

64
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,136
Nowadays, people aren't deciding on
relationships based on feelings,

65
00:04:04,243 --> 00:04:05,844
but rather on conditions.

66
00:04:06,217 --> 00:04:07,178
Everyone wants

67
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,510
to pursue someone slightly
better than themselves.

68
00:04:10,018 --> 00:04:11,511
In that case, let's all stay single.

69
00:04:12,417 --> 00:04:13,297
Enough about me.

70
00:04:13,538 --> 00:04:15,124
You haven't found anyone either, right?

71
00:04:16,057 --> 00:04:18,450
If it's hard for you to find someone,
how would it be easy for me?

72
00:04:18,978 --> 00:04:20,877
At the very least,
you need to have some roots.

73
00:04:22,417 --> 00:04:23,497
I don't even have that.

74
00:04:23,738 --> 00:04:24,538
Moreover,

75
00:04:25,618 --> 00:04:28,378
I don't even have a family.
I have nothing. How can I find someone?

76
00:04:29,137 --> 00:04:30,137
You have nothing?

77
00:04:30,217 --> 00:04:31,338
You're already a successor.

78
00:04:32,297 --> 00:04:34,603
I'm living my days like a character
in a martial arts novel now.

79
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,683
One moment I'm a successor,
and the next moment...

80
00:04:37,178 --> 00:04:38,657
I'm telling you,

81
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,400
I don't want to think about
anything else right now.

82
00:04:41,463 --> 00:04:42,811
I don't have the heart for that.

83
00:04:43,018 --> 00:04:45,098
All I want is to master this practice.

84
00:04:46,178 --> 00:04:48,738
And I genuinely feel
a sense of mission now.

85
00:04:51,738 --> 00:04:52,657
I just want

86
00:04:52,978 --> 00:04:54,018
to focus on my learning

87
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,400
and promote TCM.

88
00:05:03,657 --> 00:05:04,630
You're getting serious?

89
00:05:04,738 --> 00:05:06,057
This is unlike you.

90
00:05:06,818 --> 00:05:08,404
What about your original intention?

91
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:11,577
I'm talking about Ren Tian Zhen.

92
00:05:11,657 --> 00:05:14,057
Didn't you join back then
because you were attracted to him?

93
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:16,258
Oh, him?

94
00:05:18,937 --> 00:05:19,737
What's wrong?

95
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,240
He likes Meng Meng.

96
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:24,417
His mum thinks so too.

97
00:05:25,898 --> 00:05:26,698
I think so too.

98
00:05:27,657 --> 00:05:28,738
So, it's just...

99
00:05:29,818 --> 00:05:30,898
And besides,

100
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,098
if you don't even like Zhao Li Quan,

101
00:05:35,178 --> 00:05:35,978
someone like me,

102
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:40,978
even if I manage to achieve something,
would his family accept me?

103
00:05:41,378 --> 00:05:42,924
It's all about matching social status.

104
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,240
Don't give me that.

105
00:05:44,538 --> 00:05:47,657
What happened to the fearless
and bold Sun Tou Tou from before?

106
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:49,417
Now you're restrained

107
00:05:49,497 --> 00:05:50,417
by such worldly matters

108
00:05:50,497 --> 00:05:51,617
like social status.

109
00:05:51,697 --> 00:05:54,178
Does being fearless
mean you can have everything?

110
00:05:54,498 --> 00:05:58,031
I also want those expensive bags
in the mall worth tens of thousands.

111
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,897
I also want those houses
worth two or three millions.

112
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,770
But can I have them just
by wishing for them?

113
00:06:03,898 --> 00:06:05,218
That's why

114
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:07,498
I have to secure the inheritance

115
00:06:07,743 --> 00:06:08,658
as a successor,

116
00:06:08,738 --> 00:06:10,338
which is like a pie from the sky.

117
00:06:10,738 --> 00:06:11,538
True.

118
00:06:12,058 --> 00:06:13,458
For people like us,

119
00:06:13,938 --> 00:06:15,177
who don't even have crumbs,

120
00:06:15,257 --> 00:06:16,257
why bother considering

121
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:18,498
choosing between love and bread?

122
00:06:22,018 --> 00:06:22,818
Tou Tou,

123
00:06:24,018 --> 00:06:26,458
if neither of us find someone
when we're old,

124
00:06:27,417 --> 00:06:28,417
let's live together.

125
00:06:29,498 --> 00:06:30,298
I'll cook,

126
00:06:30,618 --> 00:06:31,684
and you'll do the dishes.

127
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,573
You'll perform acupuncture,
and I'll provide caretaking service.

128
00:06:44,938 --> 00:06:45,738
Okay.

129
00:06:46,338 --> 00:06:48,098
Okay.

130
00:06:48,178 --> 00:06:48,978
How about

131
00:06:49,377 --> 00:06:50,857
I'll cook and you'll do the dishes?

132
00:06:51,178 --> 00:06:52,177
Okay, okay.

133
00:06:52,257 --> 00:06:53,817
-Okay?
-As long as we are together.

134
00:06:53,938 --> 00:06:55,178
As long as we are together.

135
00:06:59,817 --> 00:07:00,857
Cut it out already.

136
00:07:01,137 --> 00:07:02,618
You're so melodramatic.

137
00:07:19,297 --> 00:07:20,618
I heard from my aunt

138
00:07:20,778 --> 00:07:23,891
that you had a chance to be promoted
to attending physician this year, right?

139
00:07:24,097 --> 00:07:25,738
There is nothing certain in this world.

140
00:07:25,938 --> 00:07:26,858
The title is vain.

141
00:07:26,938 --> 00:07:27,898
I understand that.

142
00:07:28,137 --> 00:07:29,937
In your tertiary hospital, they look
at your accumulated experience.

143
00:07:30,018 --> 00:07:31,744
And there are
limited positions available.

144
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,000
What about next year?

145
00:07:33,097 --> 00:07:34,777
Your promotion should
be certain then, right?

146
00:07:34,817 --> 00:07:36,857
I heard that after becoming
an attending physician,

147
00:07:36,903 --> 00:07:39,103
many private hospitals
will try to recruit doctors like you.

148
00:07:39,184 --> 00:07:40,344
Excuse me?

149
00:07:41,738 --> 00:07:42,738
Mr He,

150
00:07:43,058 --> 00:07:44,137
please calm down.

151
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,400
Since we've chosen
to go on a blind date,

152
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:48,297
it's definitely different
from love dating.

153
00:07:48,618 --> 00:07:50,537
So, there's no need for us
to test each other.

154
00:07:51,058 --> 00:07:51,858
I don't like

155
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:53,338
flirting games.

156
00:07:53,817 --> 00:07:55,658
I believe you are also not someone
who doesn't know what you're after

157
00:07:55,738 --> 00:07:56,857
and are seeking true love.

158
00:07:57,058 --> 00:07:58,871
So, let's be straightforward
with each other.

159
00:07:59,977 --> 00:08:00,777
Fine.

160
00:08:01,697 --> 00:08:03,057
If I may say...

161
00:08:03,209 --> 00:08:04,169
Don't get me wrong.

162
00:08:04,658 --> 00:08:05,698
I was thinking that,

163
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,304
you haven't bought a house, right?

164
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,023
The pay at private hospitals
is better than public hospitals.

165
00:08:10,104 --> 00:08:11,538
I heard that being a paediatrician

166
00:08:11,698 --> 00:08:13,538
at a private hospital can be
very lucrative.

167
00:08:14,377 --> 00:08:16,618
Do you have a family history
of genetic diseases?

168
00:08:16,898 --> 00:08:17,698
No.

169
00:08:18,296 --> 00:08:20,098
Do you have a house?

170
00:08:20,178 --> 00:08:20,978
Yes, I do.

171
00:08:21,137 --> 00:08:22,683
It's big enough for a family of three.

172
00:08:23,178 --> 00:08:25,137
Will you agree to do
pre-marital health check-up?

173
00:08:25,618 --> 00:08:26,418
I can do that,

174
00:08:26,618 --> 00:08:27,817
but will you cover the cost?

175
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,080
How much is your salary?

176
00:08:29,178 --> 00:08:31,271
Since I proposed it,
of course I would pay for it,

177
00:08:31,857 --> 00:08:32,897
but I haven't been working

178
00:08:32,977 --> 00:08:33,857
for some time.

179
00:08:34,178 --> 00:08:35,178
No job?

180
00:08:35,498 --> 00:08:36,738
How do you support yourself?

181
00:08:37,498 --> 00:08:38,298
Do you have a mortgage?

182
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,697
Do you have any plans about
your future career and family?

183
00:08:41,857 --> 00:08:42,898
Not really.

184
00:08:43,137 --> 00:08:46,297
-How many children do you want?
-I haven't thought about that.

185
00:08:47,817 --> 00:08:49,417
I paid off my mortgage a long time ago.

186
00:08:50,057 --> 00:08:52,537
I'm living off my previous income.

187
00:08:53,257 --> 00:08:54,538
I had a stable income before,

188
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:55,898
earning three million a year.

189
00:08:56,018 --> 00:08:56,818
Three million?

190
00:08:58,377 --> 00:08:59,297
That's great!

191
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,480
I have no issues with you.

192
00:09:02,618 --> 00:09:04,191
Why are you asking all these questions?

193
00:09:05,738 --> 00:09:06,817
To be honest,

194
00:09:07,058 --> 00:09:08,978
I divorced my ex-wife
without getting a penny.

195
00:09:09,058 --> 00:09:10,498
I'm currently renting a house.

196
00:09:11,178 --> 00:09:12,778
You have a house and no mortgage.

197
00:09:13,018 --> 00:09:14,277
I'm very satisfied with you.

198
00:09:15,837 --> 00:09:16,637
Okay.

199
00:09:16,718 --> 00:09:17,599
We can carry on then.

200
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,399
Are you busy now?

201
00:09:19,938 --> 00:09:21,131
Are you busy with your work?

202
00:09:21,257 --> 00:09:23,337
-It's okay.
-I'm not really busy.

203
00:09:23,417 --> 00:09:24,658
I have a lot of time

204
00:09:24,738 --> 00:09:25,778
to spare.

205
00:09:28,257 --> 00:09:29,658
Please stand up.

206
00:09:33,898 --> 00:09:34,698
Spin around.

207
00:09:38,851 --> 00:09:40,210
Slowly, again.

208
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,593
Okay. Please sit down.

209
00:09:50,371 --> 00:09:52,378
I have three forms here.

210
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,960
Please fill them out.

211
00:09:56,058 --> 00:09:58,218
International Standard IQ Test.

212
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,600
MBTI Career Personality Test.

213
00:10:01,803 --> 00:10:04,363
Cattell's 16 Personality Factors Test.

214
00:10:04,817 --> 00:10:05,658
What are these?

215
00:10:06,178 --> 00:10:07,737
I may need to clarify a bit more.

216
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,361
I'm not looking for
a marriage partner for myself.

217
00:10:10,658 --> 00:10:13,018
I'm looking for a father
for my future child.

218
00:10:13,577 --> 00:10:15,817
Or you could say I want
a child through marriage.

219
00:10:16,018 --> 00:10:17,218
Do you understand?

220
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,280
I do.

221
00:10:18,504 --> 00:10:19,304
Very clearly.

222
00:10:20,137 --> 00:10:22,817
So if we are mutually satisfied
with each other,

223
00:10:22,978 --> 00:10:24,258
I will have it notarized.

224
00:10:24,338 --> 00:10:26,098
I want to make this clear in advance.

225
00:10:27,497 --> 00:10:28,857
What if there are problems

226
00:10:28,937 --> 00:10:30,057
after we have a child?

227
00:10:30,177 --> 00:10:31,069
What will you do then?

228
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,330
You won't choke
the child to death, will you?

229
00:10:33,858 --> 00:10:35,098
I won't,

230
00:10:35,377 --> 00:10:36,631
but I will choke you to death.

231
00:10:40,418 --> 00:10:41,937
What is your hobby?

232
00:10:43,144 --> 00:10:43,944
I...

233
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:45,537
I like to cook.

234
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,543
Do you like watching movies
or listening to song?

235
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,600
Do you like to travel?

236
00:10:48,697 --> 00:10:49,937
Yeah, yeah.

237
00:10:50,244 --> 00:10:51,723
I have everything you want.

238
00:10:52,338 --> 00:10:53,697
You meet all my requirements.

239
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,920
How about we make it official today?

240
00:10:57,377 --> 00:10:58,177
Wait.

241
00:10:59,737 --> 00:11:00,937
Are you severely nearsighted?

242
00:11:01,858 --> 00:11:05,138
I used to be nearsighted.
I've had LASIK surgery.

243
00:11:05,218 --> 00:11:07,018
Now both of my eyes are 1.5.

244
00:11:07,098 --> 00:11:08,097
I'm sorry, we're not compatible.

245
00:11:08,177 --> 00:11:09,578
-You don't meet my requirements.
-Hold on.

246
00:11:10,778 --> 00:11:12,018
How am I suddenly not compatible?

247
00:11:12,177 --> 00:11:13,338
You're severely nearsighted,

248
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,280
and your parents are also
severely nearsighted.

249
00:11:15,377 --> 00:11:16,818
Nearsightedness has a high chance of

250
00:11:16,898 --> 00:11:18,137
being inherited according to genetics.

251
00:11:18,538 --> 00:11:19,377
No way.

252
00:11:19,658 --> 00:11:21,057
Nearsightedness can be inherited?

253
00:11:21,737 --> 00:11:22,658
Are you joking with me?

254
00:11:22,898 --> 00:11:25,458
In case my child wants
to become a pilot in the future,

255
00:11:25,538 --> 00:11:27,517
I don't want him to be
hindered by your genes.

256
00:11:27,817 --> 00:11:29,057
I'm sorry, Mr Cao.

257
00:11:29,298 --> 00:11:30,737
I have another appointment coming up.

258
00:11:30,817 --> 00:11:32,737
If you have nothing else to discuss,
please feel free to leave.

259
00:11:36,338 --> 00:11:38,497
Do you really think you're the one
who gets to choose here?

260
00:11:38,577 --> 00:11:39,617
In the dating market,

261
00:11:39,697 --> 00:11:41,818
being in your thirties
with a high education and high income

262
00:11:41,898 --> 00:11:43,898
is actually considered
a drawback for women.

263
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,263
If you want to find someone
to be a father to your child,

264
00:11:46,344 --> 00:11:48,999
you also need to consider whether
they find you desirable as a mother.

265
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,853
Can you help me clean up
the trash, please?

266
00:11:57,697 --> 00:11:58,497
What's the matter?

267
00:11:58,937 --> 00:12:00,057
Sorry.

268
00:12:00,577 --> 00:12:01,778
I think you were right.

269
00:12:01,858 --> 00:12:04,057
An insignificant doctor like me
really has no future.

270
00:12:04,137 --> 00:12:06,218
I'd hate to delay your search
for a rich husband.

271
00:12:06,298 --> 00:12:07,937
I have something else to do today.

272
00:12:08,098 --> 00:12:08,938
Let's call it a day.

273
00:12:09,018 --> 00:12:10,904
I just saw a friend.
I'm going to her.

274
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,239
Hold on. And this too.

275
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,160
Thank you.

276
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,921
Keep up, guys.

277
00:12:30,531 --> 00:12:31,331
Hurry up!

278
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,041
Watch your step.

279
00:12:38,338 --> 00:12:39,138
Tou Tou.

280
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,280
Hurry up.

281
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,096
You're exerting too much
physical energy like this.

282
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,640
Endurance is what matters in running,
not just bursts of energy.

283
00:12:49,737 --> 00:12:50,698
I just burst out once,

284
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,960
take a break, and then burst out again.
That's how I go faster.

285
00:12:53,057 --> 00:12:54,057
Suit yourself.

286
00:12:54,137 --> 00:12:55,418
Don't whine when you get tired.

287
00:12:58,538 --> 00:12:59,898
Slow down.

288
00:13:00,257 --> 00:13:01,778
Master is behind us.

289
00:13:06,617 --> 00:13:07,417
Mr Qiu,

290
00:13:07,898 --> 00:13:10,457
why did we come all the way to
this remote deep mountain forest?

291
00:13:10,898 --> 00:13:11,858
To see treasures.

292
00:13:13,737 --> 00:13:14,537
Treasures?

293
00:13:15,737 --> 00:13:16,778
What treasures are there?

294
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:19,617
This mountain is full of treasures.

295
00:13:19,969 --> 00:13:20,770
Look.

296
00:13:21,057 --> 00:13:21,937
Look at this tree.

297
00:13:22,898 --> 00:13:23,698
What about it?

298
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,720
It's a pine tree.

299
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:27,418
Pine trees are full of treasures.

300
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:29,840
I know.

301
00:13:30,091 --> 00:13:31,210
Pine needle tea,

302
00:13:31,658 --> 00:13:32,978
pine needle infused liquor,

303
00:13:33,338 --> 00:13:35,778
-right?
-And there are also pine knots,

304
00:13:36,177 --> 00:13:37,298
also known as pine nodes.

305
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:38,658
Don't underestimate them.

306
00:13:39,298 --> 00:13:41,177
If someone with tooth decay

307
00:13:41,497 --> 00:13:42,817
experiences toothache,

308
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,281
using it to boil water for rinsing

309
00:13:45,577 --> 00:13:46,458
can help

310
00:13:46,978 --> 00:13:48,218
alleviate the pain.

311
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,120
Hang on.

312
00:13:56,137 --> 00:13:56,937
Check this out.

313
00:14:03,697 --> 00:14:04,538
What is this?

314
00:14:04,778 --> 00:14:06,377
Look at this. This is

315
00:14:06,937 --> 00:14:08,016
Zazhi (a type of fungus).

316
00:14:08,177 --> 00:14:08,978
Zazhi?

317
00:14:10,737 --> 00:14:11,577
Oh, I know.

318
00:14:13,098 --> 00:14:14,497
This is the pine tree's poop, right?

319
00:14:14,577 --> 00:14:15,377
Nonsense.

320
00:14:16,817 --> 00:14:18,338
Students, come here for a second.

321
00:14:18,418 --> 00:14:20,258
-Come here.
-Come.

322
00:14:20,338 --> 00:14:21,858
We found a poop.

323
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:27,018
-Pine tree's poop.
-Come here now.

324
00:14:27,817 --> 00:14:28,617
Give it to me.

325
00:14:30,298 --> 00:14:31,357
This is a type of fungus

326
00:14:31,497 --> 00:14:33,377
that parasitizes on pine trees.

327
00:14:33,617 --> 00:14:35,098
When it grows on

328
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:36,858
or under a tree like this,

329
00:14:37,018 --> 00:14:38,338
we call it

330
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,161
Artist's bracket.

331
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:42,578
If the host tree

332
00:14:42,658 --> 00:14:43,658
is not poisonous,

333
00:14:43,778 --> 00:14:45,937
the Artist's bracket growing on it

334
00:14:46,257 --> 00:14:48,377
has high medicinal value.

335
00:14:48,858 --> 00:14:49,658
For example,

336
00:14:49,898 --> 00:14:51,364
this Zazhi growing on this pine tree

337
00:14:51,636 --> 00:14:53,617
can be used for liver protection.

338
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:56,698
So, does that mean

339
00:14:56,778 --> 00:14:59,138
we can find Lingzhi everywhere?

340
00:14:59,418 --> 00:15:00,538
Artist's bracket

341
00:15:00,898 --> 00:15:02,658
grown on different hosts

342
00:15:02,978 --> 00:15:04,697
has different effects.

343
00:15:04,858 --> 00:15:05,658
Some

344
00:15:05,817 --> 00:15:07,937
may not reach
the level of medicinal use,

345
00:15:08,377 --> 00:15:09,177
while some

346
00:15:09,497 --> 00:15:10,898
are extremely rare.

347
00:15:11,737 --> 00:15:13,338
For example, Sanghuang is a type

348
00:15:14,137 --> 00:15:16,458
of Artist's bracket
that grows on mulberry trees.

349
00:15:17,418 --> 00:15:18,898
Nature has provided us

350
00:15:18,978 --> 00:15:20,298
with many treasures,

351
00:15:20,809 --> 00:15:21,970
including ginseng.

352
00:15:22,778 --> 00:15:24,697
So, we might

353
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:26,978
come across ginseng today.

354
00:15:28,658 --> 00:15:30,978
-There is ginseng in this area?
-Of course.

355
00:15:33,978 --> 00:15:35,218
What are you doing?

356
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:38,617
I'm praying to come across
a ginseng later.

357
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:40,057
What do you want ginseng for?

358
00:15:40,257 --> 00:15:41,417
Didn't Bone Zhu always have

359
00:15:41,497 --> 00:15:43,658
a strong desire to eat ginseng before?

360
00:15:43,978 --> 00:15:45,618
I was thinking that
if I come across it today,

361
00:15:45,699 --> 00:15:47,178
I will bring one back for him.

362
00:15:47,817 --> 00:15:49,898
Don't be greedy.

363
00:15:50,418 --> 00:15:53,018
Ginseng is also known as "earth spirit".

364
00:15:53,858 --> 00:15:56,418
For example, if there is one
ginseng plant in this area,

365
00:15:56,658 --> 00:15:57,858
then there won't be

366
00:15:58,098 --> 00:15:59,978
any others for several years.

367
00:16:00,617 --> 00:16:02,858
It absorbs all the earth's energy.

368
00:16:03,257 --> 00:16:05,297
So, if we need it, we use it.

369
00:16:05,377 --> 00:16:08,218
If we don't need it, we should
leave it for someone who does.

370
00:16:09,338 --> 00:16:11,218
This way, we also conserve
the earth's energy.

371
00:16:13,177 --> 00:16:14,858
-Let's go.
-Okay. Let's go.

372
00:16:15,658 --> 00:16:16,938
-I'll lead the way!
-Okay!

373
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:18,578
Watch your step.

374
00:16:18,658 --> 00:16:19,577
Slow down, slow down.

375
00:17:14,298 --> 00:17:15,857
Sorry, this seat is taken.

376
00:17:15,937 --> 00:17:18,363
Since your next date isn't here yet,
why don't you give me a chance?

377
00:17:20,418 --> 00:17:22,377
Why are you here?
What are you doing here?

378
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,817
Whatever you are doing here,
I'm doing the same thing.

379
00:17:32,817 --> 00:17:35,018
I didn't expect someone like you
would fail in a blind date.

380
00:17:35,098 --> 00:17:36,057
Whatever.

381
00:17:36,177 --> 00:17:38,156
I'm not rushing to get married.
It's my parents who are pressuring me.

382
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:40,418
You, on the other hand,

383
00:17:40,658 --> 00:17:42,177
you skipped the apprentice class

384
00:17:42,257 --> 00:17:43,698
to come here for blind dates.

385
00:17:43,778 --> 00:17:45,218
Why? Are you that urgent?

386
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:46,258
The class can wait.

387
00:17:46,338 --> 00:17:48,538
Learning is a lifelong process.

388
00:17:48,937 --> 00:17:50,098
This is more urgent.

389
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,440
Biology doesn't allow me to wait.

390
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:53,538
I want a blood relative.

391
00:17:56,377 --> 00:17:57,577
You weren't in a rush
for the first 30 years.

392
00:17:57,617 --> 00:17:59,177
How did you suddenly
come to this realisation?

393
00:17:59,257 --> 00:18:01,057
Yes, I just did.

394
00:18:01,338 --> 00:18:03,297
So, please don't disturb me, okay?
Thanks.

395
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,156
Let me take a look
at your requirements.

396
00:18:06,018 --> 00:18:07,377
Education level.

397
00:18:07,697 --> 00:18:09,976
Is this from the Ministry of Education
or an international one?

398
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,879
IQ Index.

399
00:18:13,018 --> 00:18:15,477
Don't tell me you even prepared
a set of Mensa test questions.

400
00:18:17,418 --> 00:18:18,418
You did prepare it.

401
00:18:19,817 --> 00:18:22,018
Height, family history of disease,

402
00:18:22,098 --> 00:18:23,138
bad habits,

403
00:18:23,218 --> 00:18:25,057
physical health condition.

404
00:18:25,936 --> 00:18:28,096
Even the interviews at
the top 500 global companies

405
00:18:28,177 --> 00:18:29,536
don't cover all these questions.

406
00:18:30,018 --> 00:18:32,218
The age difference of up to
ten years is acceptable.

407
00:18:33,817 --> 00:18:35,857
If it's ten years younger,
are they even of legal marriage age?

408
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:37,770
It's right at 22 years old.

409
00:18:39,658 --> 00:18:41,298
I actually meet your criteria.

410
00:18:41,898 --> 00:18:43,051
How about we give it a try?

411
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,321
Just think about it.

412
00:18:48,778 --> 00:18:50,698
In my case, my parents
are eager for grandchildren,

413
00:18:50,778 --> 00:18:52,618
and you want a child of your own.

414
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:54,418
The three of you share the same goal.

415
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,417
I am

416
00:18:55,617 --> 00:18:56,857
sacrificing myself for it.

417
00:18:59,217 --> 00:19:00,017
You're not suitable.

418
00:19:00,538 --> 00:19:02,857
Why am I not suitable? I'm healthy.
I have no bad habits.

419
00:19:02,977 --> 00:19:06,136
I've even done all these tests before.
I definitely meet the standard.

420
00:19:06,217 --> 00:19:07,217
Your health is not up to par.

421
00:19:07,977 --> 00:19:10,497
Firstly, your work condition
doesn't meet the standards.

422
00:19:11,097 --> 00:19:12,098
You're not even qualified
to donate sperm.

423
00:19:12,178 --> 00:19:13,738
If you want to meet my standards,

424
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,856
you must resign

425
00:19:14,937 --> 00:19:17,600
and rest at home for at least three
months or more to improve your health.

426
00:19:17,663 --> 00:19:19,264
If you can't do that,
then you're not suitable.

427
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,720
Well, then you shouldn't be here
looking for a partner.

428
00:19:20,818 --> 00:19:22,897
Just go directly to the sperm bank
and pick out some sperm.

429
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,520
I want to at least
check out the looks.

430
00:19:24,617 --> 00:19:25,858
My looks are quite good.

431
00:19:25,938 --> 00:19:26,738
Look at me.

432
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,226
(Mr Fu: Sorry, Ms Yang.)

433
00:19:28,307 --> 00:19:29,440
(Something came up today.
Let's meet some other time.)

434
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,546
Are you free later?

435
00:19:34,844 --> 00:19:35,833
What do you want to do?

436
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,120
Don't you want to go on
a blind date with me?

437
00:19:38,217 --> 00:19:39,257
I'm giving you a chance.

438
00:19:39,698 --> 00:19:41,097
What about your date?

439
00:19:41,337 --> 00:19:42,137
He's not coming.

440
00:19:42,337 --> 00:19:43,458
-Are you coming?
-Yes.

441
00:19:43,538 --> 00:19:44,457
Let's go.

442
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:55,978
You haven't even found
a father of your baby yet.

443
00:19:56,058 --> 00:19:57,884
Don't you think
it's too early to buy these?

444
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,559
I'm visiting Chen Hui and her son later.

445
00:20:00,851 --> 00:20:02,131
I can't go empty-handed, can I?

446
00:20:02,658 --> 00:20:03,977
Why do you need me here then?

447
00:20:04,604 --> 00:20:05,964
You can be my advisor.

448
00:20:06,298 --> 00:20:07,377
Aren't you a professional?

449
00:20:08,178 --> 00:20:09,857
You pick the gifts. I will pay for them.

450
00:20:10,217 --> 00:20:11,017
All right.

451
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,241
These shoes are cute!

452
00:20:14,737 --> 00:20:15,537
Look.

453
00:20:17,058 --> 00:20:18,338
Chen Hui's baby was just born

454
00:20:18,418 --> 00:20:19,938
before the Spring Festival, right?

455
00:20:20,178 --> 00:20:20,978
Yes.

456
00:20:22,611 --> 00:20:23,811
Then these aren't suitable.

457
00:20:25,097 --> 00:20:25,897
Why?

458
00:20:26,377 --> 00:20:28,657
These are for one-year-old babies.

459
00:20:28,737 --> 00:20:30,617
A one-month-old baby
can't wear them at all.

460
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,079
If you want to be a mother,
besides finding a father,

461
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,881
you've got a lot to learn.

462
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:39,537
Wait here.

463
00:21:08,857 --> 00:21:09,657
This one.

464
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,840
The baby's vision is not
fully developed yet,

465
00:21:12,909 --> 00:21:14,917
so they need more visual
and auditory stimulation.

466
00:21:15,217 --> 00:21:17,818
Even if the mother is asleep at night,
the baby won't feel lonely.

467
00:21:20,298 --> 00:21:21,098
And this.

468
00:21:21,778 --> 00:21:23,377
You see, it lights up and plays music,

469
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,340
which helps with auditory development.

470
00:21:28,698 --> 00:21:29,498
And this one

471
00:21:29,698 --> 00:21:30,844
is for tactile stimulation,

472
00:21:30,938 --> 00:21:31,938
the baby can grasp it.

473
00:21:33,178 --> 00:21:33,978
This one too.

474
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,840
Oh, and please don't buy

475
00:21:38,938 --> 00:21:41,137
common items
like blankets, clothes, pacifiers.

476
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:42,698
They're piling up like a truckload.

477
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,698
But these are too little.

478
00:21:48,337 --> 00:21:49,657
Isn't there

479
00:21:49,737 --> 00:21:51,618
a popular pillow that shapes

480
00:21:51,698 --> 00:21:52,578
the baby's head into

481
00:21:52,658 --> 00:21:53,657
a nice shape these days?

482
00:21:53,737 --> 00:21:56,177
Milady, the bones of a newborn baby
are very soft.

483
00:21:56,257 --> 00:21:57,698
Their spine is straight
for the first three months

484
00:21:57,778 --> 00:21:59,498
without any physiological curvature.

485
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,720
If you give them a pillow,
it will make them uncomfortable.

486
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,857
-But...
-All right. Don't say another word.

487
00:22:04,604 --> 00:22:07,364
The so-called head shaping
is just using a towel

488
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,480
to cushion

489
00:22:10,337 --> 00:22:11,137
and secure it.

490
00:22:11,824 --> 00:22:13,344
Just like this.

491
00:22:14,737 --> 00:22:15,658
Okay. Say nothing.

492
00:22:16,058 --> 00:22:18,778
Leave the task of choosing gifts
to me, a professional paediatrician.

493
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:23,057
I didn't realise

494
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,617
before that you are
a professional doctor.

495
00:22:25,938 --> 00:22:27,658
Today, you seem like one.

496
00:22:28,617 --> 00:22:30,058
I also realised today

497
00:22:30,178 --> 00:22:32,839
that you are quite detached
from worldly matters, Ms. Yang.

498
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,233
These are all you need.

499
00:22:37,298 --> 00:22:38,858
-Let's pay for them.
-Let's go.

500
00:22:42,018 --> 00:22:43,018
These are so expensive!

501
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,776
Are babies cash-eating monsters?

502
00:22:44,857 --> 00:22:45,657
What did you expect?

503
00:22:45,898 --> 00:22:46,897
Now you can experience it in advance.

504
00:22:46,977 --> 00:22:49,010
And it will put an end
to your matchmaking plans.

505
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,866
Even if they are cash-eating monster,
I still want one.

506
00:22:53,778 --> 00:22:54,724
WeChat Pay, thank you.

507
00:23:00,938 --> 00:23:02,977
Oh, my God. His skin is so fair.

508
00:23:05,097 --> 00:23:06,818
He is smiling!

509
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,760
He knows

510
00:23:09,178 --> 00:23:11,058
that his lifesaver has come to see him.

511
00:23:11,617 --> 00:23:12,538
He likes you.

512
00:23:13,473 --> 00:23:14,498
Naughty boy,

513
00:23:14,578 --> 00:23:17,097
did you know that you were mischievous?

514
00:23:17,418 --> 00:23:18,858
You were in such a hurry

515
00:23:18,938 --> 00:23:20,898
to come out of your mum's belly.

516
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,217
Your mummy endured a lot of pain
to give birth to you.

517
00:23:23,298 --> 00:23:24,098
When you grow up,

518
00:23:24,178 --> 00:23:26,497
you must be a good son, okay?

519
00:23:28,737 --> 00:23:30,018
What's his name?

520
00:23:30,669 --> 00:23:33,789
Kong Nian Yuan.

521
00:23:34,578 --> 00:23:35,938
Kong Nian Hong.

522
00:23:38,811 --> 00:23:40,130
You saved

523
00:23:40,217 --> 00:23:41,298
both of our lives.

524
00:23:42,178 --> 00:23:43,698
I want him to remember it

525
00:23:43,778 --> 00:23:45,024
and always be grateful to you.

526
00:23:47,938 --> 00:23:49,818
I also want you to be his godmother.

527
00:23:50,457 --> 00:23:51,857
Will you say yes?

528
00:23:55,497 --> 00:23:57,018
You have to say yes.

529
00:23:58,337 --> 00:24:00,178
You're so intelligent and outstanding.

530
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,840
You succeed in anything you do.

531
00:24:02,938 --> 00:24:03,738
Look at you,

532
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,800
transitioning from a lawyer
to a TCM practitioner.

533
00:24:05,898 --> 00:24:07,658
It's boundary-crossing.

534
00:24:08,217 --> 00:24:09,737
That's why I want our child

535
00:24:10,503 --> 00:24:12,097
to also benefit from your blessings.

536
00:24:15,698 --> 00:24:17,418
I'm not as great
as you make me out to be.

537
00:24:19,617 --> 00:24:20,737
I'm doing this

538
00:24:22,018 --> 00:24:23,457
as a way of redemption.

539
00:24:23,938 --> 00:24:25,178
It wasn't your fault.

540
00:24:25,617 --> 00:24:26,938
Professor Ren said

541
00:24:27,783 --> 00:24:28,991
it was impermanence.

542
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,018
I couldn't

543
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:36,857
accept Zhi Yuan's sudden passing before.

544
00:24:38,137 --> 00:24:40,058
I thought blaming you

545
00:24:40,658 --> 00:24:42,818
would alleviate my own inner pain.

546
00:24:45,857 --> 00:24:47,337
Now, with our child here,

547
00:24:47,938 --> 00:24:49,257
looking at this little face,

548
00:24:50,058 --> 00:24:50,977
I realised that

549
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:53,298
God won't leave us

550
00:24:54,137 --> 00:24:55,938
without a way forward.

551
00:24:56,898 --> 00:24:57,977
It takes,

552
00:24:58,898 --> 00:25:00,097
but it also gives.

553
00:25:01,658 --> 00:25:03,337
I will always remember that day

554
00:25:04,898 --> 00:25:08,418
when you tightly wrapped
me and my son in clothes,

555
00:25:08,977 --> 00:25:10,338
(while you stood in the cold wind)

556
00:25:10,418 --> 00:25:11,964
(with just a single layer of clothing.)

557
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:23,320
Despite my harsh words
towards you at that time,

558
00:25:24,538 --> 00:25:26,538
you still responded with love.

559
00:25:29,617 --> 00:25:30,417
It was

560
00:25:31,377 --> 00:25:33,018
at the moment when you saved my son

561
00:25:33,257 --> 00:25:34,298
that I realised

562
00:25:35,298 --> 00:25:37,058
you are my saviour.

563
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,320
Nian Hong,

564
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:51,658
I'm your godmother.

565
00:25:53,058 --> 00:25:54,737
Do you know me?

566
00:25:55,418 --> 00:25:56,737
Why is it "Nian Hong"?

567
00:25:57,698 --> 00:26:00,176
Why does a boy's name
have the character for "red"?

568
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,961
Because his godmother's name
is Yang Xiao Hong.

569
00:26:10,457 --> 00:26:11,257
Nian Hong.

570
00:26:11,538 --> 00:26:12,338
Nian Hong.

571
00:26:21,529 --> 00:26:22,782
This road is not easy to walk.

572
00:26:23,557 --> 00:26:25,157
It's much easier to walk than before.

573
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:27,850
Mr Qiu,

574
00:26:28,737 --> 00:26:31,658
the treasure is hidden
so deep in the forest.

575
00:26:32,097 --> 00:26:34,070
Common people won't be able
to find it for sure.

576
00:26:34,778 --> 00:26:36,898
We usually don't come to this area.

577
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,241
It's too easy to get lost.

578
00:26:39,418 --> 00:26:41,177
-Be careful, Professor Ren.
-Okay.

579
00:26:41,257 --> 00:26:43,418
Then why did we come today?

580
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:45,018
Over a decade ago,

581
00:26:45,457 --> 00:26:46,457
when Mr Qiu came here,

582
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,729
he left a mark on
a wild ginseng plant here

583
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:50,131
by tying a red string around it.

584
00:26:50,418 --> 00:26:51,418
But later on,

585
00:26:51,737 --> 00:26:53,938
no one was able to see
that wild ginseng plant again.

586
00:26:55,018 --> 00:26:58,078
However, a few days ago,
I rediscovered that wild ginseng plant.

587
00:26:58,578 --> 00:26:59,777
The red string tied around it

588
00:26:59,857 --> 00:27:01,058
was all torn and tattered,

589
00:27:01,277 --> 00:27:03,600
but I still recognized it
at first glance.

590
00:27:03,698 --> 00:27:05,658
So, I notified Mr Qiu immediately.

591
00:27:06,337 --> 00:27:07,418
When I first

592
00:27:08,058 --> 00:27:09,058
saw it back then,

593
00:27:09,897 --> 00:27:11,336
it was already the size of a hand.

594
00:27:11,418 --> 00:27:13,031
So many years have passed since then,

595
00:27:13,137 --> 00:27:14,658
I wonder how it has grown.

596
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,040
If we all get

597
00:27:16,137 --> 00:27:17,818
to see this treasure today,

598
00:27:18,217 --> 00:27:20,178
it's all thanks to you.

599
00:27:22,497 --> 00:27:23,417
Okay. Let's go.

600
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,400
Let's go.

601
00:27:24,658 --> 00:27:25,458
Be careful.

602
00:27:27,137 --> 00:27:28,497
What's...

603
00:27:29,538 --> 00:27:31,298
What's so special about this treasure?

604
00:27:35,263 --> 00:27:37,497
It's extremely challenging
for a ginseng plant to grow,

605
00:27:38,298 --> 00:27:39,497
especially wild ginseng.

606
00:27:39,898 --> 00:27:42,377
The leaf whorls of wild ginseng
grow at the end of the stem.

607
00:27:42,898 --> 00:27:45,298
Five small leaves
make up one palm-sized ginseng.

608
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,280
Conservatively, it takes
at least ten years

609
00:27:47,357 --> 00:27:49,617
for a ginseng to reach the stage
of having five leaves,

610
00:27:49,698 --> 00:27:50,698
but the exact age

611
00:27:50,778 --> 00:27:52,698
of the ginseng is determined
based on the ginseng pattern and body.

612
00:27:52,778 --> 00:27:55,137
The legendary millennium ginseng
is even rarer.

613
00:27:55,578 --> 00:27:58,097
It is said that in the 1990s,
during an auction in Hong Kong,

614
00:27:58,337 --> 00:27:59,777
half of a millennium ginseng plant

615
00:27:59,857 --> 00:28:01,896
was sold for a sky-high price
of 200 million yuan.

616
00:28:06,377 --> 00:28:07,297
In that case,

617
00:28:07,377 --> 00:28:08,418
does that mean

618
00:28:08,737 --> 00:28:10,298
it's a big fortune if we find one?

619
00:28:24,097 --> 00:28:25,097
Wait for me!

620
00:28:29,931 --> 00:28:31,451
Wait for me!

621
00:28:39,178 --> 00:28:40,938
Professor Ren, Mr Qiu,
it should be in front.

622
00:28:41,018 --> 00:28:42,057
-Be careful.
-Okay.

623
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:43,017
Those behind, keep up.

624
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,759
-Okay.
-Here, easy.

625
00:28:45,097 --> 00:28:45,977
Keep up, guys.

626
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,760
Professor Ren, Mr Qiu!

627
00:28:52,857 --> 00:28:54,218
Professor Ren, Mr Qiu, look!

628
00:28:54,298 --> 00:28:55,897
-I found it.
-You did?

629
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:57,618
Is it that one?

630
00:28:58,137 --> 00:28:59,777
-Let me see.
-The red string.

631
00:28:59,977 --> 00:29:01,058
Easy, easy.

632
00:29:01,538 --> 00:29:02,338
Easy.

633
00:29:02,938 --> 00:29:04,658
So, this is the millennium monster?

634
00:29:05,377 --> 00:29:06,457
I mean, millennium ginseng?

635
00:29:08,097 --> 00:29:09,178
It's the string I tied.

636
00:29:09,617 --> 00:29:12,137
Yes, it's the wild ginseng plant
I saw back then.

637
00:29:12,377 --> 00:29:12,937
No.

638
00:29:12,991 --> 00:29:15,150
This is an opportunity
we couldn't wish for more.

639
00:29:15,578 --> 00:29:17,217
It's also my first time seeing this.

640
00:29:18,097 --> 00:29:19,897
Mr Qiu, can we dig it up now?

641
00:29:19,977 --> 00:29:21,458
Do we need to do some kind of ceremony?

642
00:29:21,538 --> 00:29:23,578
If we don't dig it now,
what if it's gone again?

643
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,680
Let me explain first.

644
00:29:26,298 --> 00:29:27,257
This ginseng

645
00:29:27,898 --> 00:29:30,497
is a perennial herbaceous plant.

646
00:29:30,737 --> 00:29:31,618
During winter,

647
00:29:31,717 --> 00:29:33,557
it withers and goes into dormancy.

648
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,080
We call it "false death."

649
00:29:35,938 --> 00:29:38,258
When it encounters unfavourable
climate conditions for growth,

650
00:29:38,298 --> 00:29:40,778
it can remain dormant
throughout the year.

651
00:29:41,457 --> 00:29:42,337
So,

652
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,217
it's truly a miracle for us

653
00:29:44,298 --> 00:29:46,776
to come across a wild ginseng

654
00:29:46,857 --> 00:29:48,257
that's nearly a hundred years old.

655
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:52,058
What are we waiting for then?
Let's dig it out now.

656
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:55,037
We must first pay homage
to the mountain god.

657
00:29:57,137 --> 00:29:58,177
Pay homage
to the mountain god.

658
00:29:58,257 --> 00:29:59,617
Master. Master.

659
00:30:25,137 --> 00:30:27,298
Mr Qiu, Professor Ren,

660
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,240
we must not dig up this ginseng!

661
00:30:29,658 --> 00:30:31,777
-Let's return the way we came!
-We are returning the way we came!

662
00:30:31,857 --> 00:30:32,657
Okay, let's go.

663
00:30:33,137 --> 00:30:34,023
Hang on.

664
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,280
Why are we going back?

665
00:30:35,377 --> 00:30:36,538
We have to dig it up, Master!

666
00:30:36,898 --> 00:30:38,497
We really shouldn't dig it up!

667
00:30:39,578 --> 00:30:42,297
Look, this ginseng should be
protected by a god.

668
00:30:42,377 --> 00:30:44,257
We chanted toward it together. And look,

669
00:30:44,457 --> 00:30:46,418
the weather changed immediately.

670
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,840
It's telling us that we need to
leave it where it is.

671
00:30:48,938 --> 00:30:49,738
Mr Qiu,

672
00:30:50,018 --> 00:30:51,178
the same thing happened last time.

673
00:30:51,298 --> 00:30:54,298
We were just about to dig it out,
and a thunderbolt nearly struck me.

674
00:30:54,457 --> 00:30:55,337
We gave up right away.

675
00:30:55,377 --> 00:30:58,698
-Let's go. We can't dig it up.
-That's superstition.

676
00:30:58,778 --> 00:31:00,537
-We have to dig it out!
-No, we can't.

677
00:31:00,617 --> 00:31:01,578
-Let's go.
-It's okay.

678
00:31:01,658 --> 00:31:02,458
Listen,

679
00:31:02,617 --> 00:31:04,898
we must have reverence for nature.

680
00:31:05,217 --> 00:31:07,337
This place could collapse when it rains.

681
00:31:07,538 --> 00:31:09,377
-Let's go now. Come on.
-But it worth millions.

682
00:31:09,457 --> 00:31:10,377
Let's go now.

683
00:31:10,457 --> 00:31:12,417
-Millions!
-Give Professor Ren a hand.

684
00:31:12,497 --> 00:31:13,297
Let's go.

685
00:31:14,097 --> 00:31:15,617
We are just going to leave it there?

686
00:31:16,538 --> 00:31:18,217
Your life worth more than that. Come on!

687
00:31:18,818 --> 00:31:20,618
-There is nothing to be afraid of.
-Come on!

688
00:31:24,018 --> 00:31:25,257
Hurry up!

689
00:31:25,538 --> 00:31:27,057
-Let's go!
-No!

690
00:31:28,018 --> 00:31:28,818
Come on!

691
00:31:55,298 --> 00:31:56,737
Yang Xiao Hong!

692
00:31:56,938 --> 00:31:58,097
Rebecca.

693
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,881
Yang Xiao Hong.

694
00:32:00,816 --> 00:32:02,498
Yang Xiao Hong! Rebecca.

695
00:32:02,578 --> 00:32:03,977
Will you ever stop?

696
00:32:06,116 --> 00:32:08,098
Why do you hide your Chinese name?

697
00:32:08,178 --> 00:32:09,457
Your name sounds so nice.

698
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,760
It's simple and easy to pronounce.

699
00:32:12,137 --> 00:32:14,377
I'm afraid everyone will react
the same way as you.

700
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,320
It's annoying.

701
00:32:20,298 --> 00:32:21,538
You will be a good mother.

702
00:32:25,377 --> 00:32:27,257
I don't even know
who my baby's father is.

703
00:32:27,898 --> 00:32:29,178
It doesn't matter who he is.

704
00:32:29,617 --> 00:32:31,056
You will still be a good mother.

705
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:11,920
Meng Meng!

706
00:33:13,217 --> 00:33:14,017
Meng Meng!

707
00:33:14,778 --> 00:33:16,177
-We're back!
-You're back.

708
00:33:16,257 --> 00:33:17,057
You know,

709
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,880
we saw a millennium ginseng

710
00:33:18,977 --> 00:33:20,857
worth a few million yuan.

711
00:33:21,018 --> 00:33:21,818
Show it to me.

712
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,843
We didn't bring it back.
We were so close to digging it out.

713
00:33:24,924 --> 00:33:25,764
They wouldn't let us dig it out.

714
00:33:27,058 --> 00:33:29,257
Ms Song said this is good
for dispelling cold. Have some.

715
00:33:29,337 --> 00:33:30,898
-This too?
-Yes.

716
00:33:31,018 --> 00:33:32,458
Have some ginger soup, everyone.

717
00:33:32,538 --> 00:33:34,057
I wonder what that
a few million yuan ginseng

718
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:35,898
would taste like
if it was boiled in soup.

719
00:33:36,418 --> 00:33:38,017
-Is it that old?
-Yes.

720
00:33:38,818 --> 00:33:39,618
Have some water.

721
00:33:44,137 --> 00:33:45,617
-Thank you.
-What are you doing here?

722
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:46,658
Professor,

723
00:33:46,857 --> 00:33:48,137
we are in trouble.

724
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:50,298
The TCM Park is in jeopardy.

725
00:33:50,457 --> 00:33:52,578
It has reached
a critical point of survival.

726
00:34:00,018 --> 00:34:01,938
Professor, do you remember

727
00:34:02,018 --> 00:34:03,050
the last time I went abroad to negotiate

728
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,360
for the distributorship deal
of a new medicine?

729
00:34:04,457 --> 00:34:05,497
Yes, I remember.

730
00:34:05,938 --> 00:34:07,337
Didn't you already get the deal?

731
00:34:07,938 --> 00:34:08,898
Yes,

732
00:34:09,217 --> 00:34:10,538
at first I thought that

733
00:34:10,737 --> 00:34:12,777
if I could introduce this cutting-edge
technology to the country,

734
00:34:12,857 --> 00:34:16,250
I would be the first distributor
of the new medicine.

735
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:20,137
But who would have thought

736
00:34:20,737 --> 00:34:22,097
that there was no such a thing?

737
00:34:22,257 --> 00:34:23,897
It's all a sham.

738
00:34:23,977 --> 00:34:25,257
We've all been deceived.

739
00:34:27,097 --> 00:34:30,263
I was supposed to receive the first
batch of medicine after Spring Festival,

740
00:34:30,857 --> 00:34:32,058
but nothing came.

741
00:34:32,298 --> 00:34:33,418
I called the customs office,

742
00:34:34,018 --> 00:34:36,710
and they said that all the logistics
information provided was fake.

743
00:34:36,818 --> 00:34:38,337
It was all virtual shipments.

744
00:34:38,658 --> 00:34:41,538
But I had already transferred the
full payment before Spring Festival.

745
00:34:47,938 --> 00:34:48,738
Mr Liu,

746
00:34:49,058 --> 00:34:50,337
didn't you see the medicine

747
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,120
when you went there?

748
00:34:52,211 --> 00:34:53,490
I did see it.

749
00:34:53,698 --> 00:34:54,777
The person who provided me
with the medicine

750
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,520
is my good friend of many years.

751
00:34:56,617 --> 00:34:57,818
He invested in this medicine.

752
00:34:58,217 --> 00:34:59,790
His profit in the first year tripled,

753
00:34:59,898 --> 00:35:01,658
a 300% increase.

754
00:35:02,457 --> 00:35:03,778
He took me to the factory,

755
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,296
showed me the production line,

756
00:35:05,377 --> 00:35:06,938
and introduced other agents
from different countries

757
00:35:07,018 --> 00:35:07,938
who went there like me.

758
00:35:08,097 --> 00:35:09,457
So, I believed him.

759
00:35:10,178 --> 00:35:11,737
But I had no idea that their profits

760
00:35:12,018 --> 00:35:14,538
in the first year
didn't come from selling the medicine,

761
00:35:14,658 --> 00:35:17,698
but from the so-called
group commissions.

762
00:35:19,818 --> 00:35:21,058
It's a Ponzi scheme.

763
00:35:21,217 --> 00:35:22,017
What?

764
00:35:22,298 --> 00:35:23,098
Hang on.

765
00:35:23,617 --> 00:35:24,497
Hang on, Mr Liu,

766
00:35:25,097 --> 00:35:26,617
do you owe them a lot of money?

767
00:35:26,698 --> 00:35:28,458
I don't owe them any money.
I transferred full payment.

768
00:35:28,538 --> 00:35:30,938
You owe them money.

769
00:35:31,018 --> 00:35:32,137
What does it have to do
with the TCM Park?

770
00:35:32,217 --> 00:35:33,538
What's the use of coming to us?

771
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,720
Mr Liu,

772
00:35:34,898 --> 00:35:36,658
are you saying that

773
00:35:37,377 --> 00:35:38,818
you want to mortgage

774
00:35:39,457 --> 00:35:40,777
the TCM Park?

775
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,720
What?

776
00:35:43,716 --> 00:35:44,938
I can't repay the bank loan,

777
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:47,378
so I can only mortgage
the land in the park.

778
00:35:48,298 --> 00:35:49,098
Professor,

779
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:51,298
I really need your help.

780
00:35:51,497 --> 00:35:52,977
If I still have control over this land,

781
00:35:53,058 --> 00:35:55,138
I can continue running the TCM Park.

782
00:35:55,657 --> 00:35:56,978
We can continue negotiations

783
00:35:57,058 --> 00:35:58,298
for the project with Mr Wu.

784
00:35:58,497 --> 00:35:59,698
Your apprentice class

785
00:35:59,778 --> 00:36:00,937
can continue as well.

786
00:36:01,177 --> 00:36:03,778
But if this land is auctioned off,

787
00:36:04,298 --> 00:36:05,938
there's no telling

788
00:36:06,018 --> 00:36:07,138
if we can continue the park.

789
00:36:11,497 --> 00:36:13,737
We are in the same boat now.

790
00:36:14,697 --> 00:36:15,497
Professor,

791
00:36:17,476 --> 00:36:18,677
please figure something out.

792
00:36:20,977 --> 00:36:22,217
This is such a big hole.

793
00:36:22,858 --> 00:36:23,738
What can I do?

794
00:36:23,818 --> 00:36:24,898
I can't figure anything out.

795
00:36:24,937 --> 00:36:26,098
You have a way.

796
00:36:26,338 --> 00:36:27,697
You definitely have a way.

797
00:36:27,937 --> 00:36:29,217
I went all the way

798
00:36:29,338 --> 00:36:30,697
to your house to see you.

799
00:36:31,138 --> 00:36:33,298
When I was looking for you,
your parents-in-law

800
00:36:33,737 --> 00:36:35,457
said that you came here
to find a treasure.

801
00:36:35,858 --> 00:36:36,778
I heard from Tou Tou

802
00:36:37,217 --> 00:36:38,458
that you found

803
00:36:38,538 --> 00:36:39,904
a hundred-year-old wild ginseng,

804
00:36:40,444 --> 00:36:41,244
right?

805
00:36:43,298 --> 00:36:45,357
How could you eavesdrop on
people's conversations?

806
00:36:46,578 --> 00:36:48,538
I'm sorry, Tou Tou.
I'll apologise to you.

807
00:36:48,737 --> 00:36:50,018
The situation is urgent now.

808
00:36:50,257 --> 00:36:53,618
Professor, do you remember the time
we had dinner with the investors?

809
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,519
There was a big shot
who admires you a lot.

810
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:58,359
While others collect
cigars and fine wines,

811
00:36:58,457 --> 00:36:59,497
he collects ginseng.

812
00:36:59,703 --> 00:37:01,617
If we bring this wild ginseng to him,

813
00:37:01,697 --> 00:37:03,097
things will turn around.

814
00:37:03,177 --> 00:37:04,858
We can't dig up this wild ginseng.

815
00:37:05,697 --> 00:37:06,543
Besides,

816
00:37:06,858 --> 00:37:09,218
it belongs to Mr Qiu,

817
00:37:09,298 --> 00:37:10,458
not me.

818
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,880
There are rules in the mountains.

819
00:37:11,977 --> 00:37:14,778
Whoever ties the string around it
owns the wild ginseng.

820
00:37:15,338 --> 00:37:17,938
My esteemed professor,
we are having a crisis now.

821
00:37:18,018 --> 00:37:19,337
Anyone can dig it up.

822
00:37:19,417 --> 00:37:21,018
Digging up this wild ginseng

823
00:37:21,098 --> 00:37:23,138
is also a contribution to TCM, isn't it?

824
00:37:23,298 --> 00:37:25,418
I'm sure Mr Qiu can understand, right?

825
00:37:25,657 --> 00:37:26,457
Mr Liu,

826
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,556
the road conditions in these mountains

827
00:37:28,637 --> 00:37:30,276
are extremely dangerous.

828
00:37:30,664 --> 00:37:32,184
Even if we go back now,

829
00:37:32,657 --> 00:37:33,977
we might not find it.

830
00:37:34,378 --> 00:37:35,818
Plus, the weather in the mountains

831
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,537
is changing drastically today.

832
00:37:37,618 --> 00:37:38,538
It's too dangerous.

833
00:37:38,937 --> 00:37:41,256
I will provide the money
to hire the best ginseng farmers.

834
00:37:42,098 --> 00:37:43,298
We can't force it.

835
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,480
Finding the ginseng depends on fate.

836
00:37:45,578 --> 00:37:47,051
If it's not meant to be,
then we shouldn't get it.

837
00:37:47,457 --> 00:37:48,257
Mr Liu,

838
00:37:48,818 --> 00:37:51,298
if you really want a wild ginseng,

839
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,759
a patient of mine

840
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,760
has a wild ginseng plant
that is 40 years old.

841
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,960
I can talk to him about it.

842
00:37:57,023 --> 00:37:57,864
Hold on.

843
00:37:58,018 --> 00:38:00,577
There's a big difference between 40
and 100 years in terms of market value.

844
00:38:00,657 --> 00:38:01,977
They are incomparable.

845
00:38:05,058 --> 00:38:05,858
All right now,

846
00:38:06,058 --> 00:38:07,317
the weather isn't good today.

847
00:38:07,657 --> 00:38:09,656
Why don't you stay in
the mountains for the night?

848
00:38:09,737 --> 00:38:10,736
Let's have a meal first.

849
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,559
-Let's have a meal first.
-Yes.

850
00:38:12,697 --> 00:38:13,497
Let's eat.

851
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:15,091
Tou Tou, let's eat.

852
00:38:19,457 --> 00:38:21,538
Tou Tou has tied fluorescent strings
along the way.

853
00:38:22,177 --> 00:38:24,043
Why did Mr Ren say
it's hard to find the way?

854
00:38:29,138 --> 00:38:30,257
Fluorescent strings?

855
00:38:56,338 --> 00:38:57,177
What's on your mind?

856
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,364
Are you still thinking about the park?

857
00:39:01,257 --> 00:39:02,057
So...

858
00:39:03,497 --> 00:39:04,977
If we lose the TCM park,

859
00:39:05,697 --> 00:39:07,778
then our apprentice class
can't continue.

860
00:39:08,457 --> 00:39:09,858
I finally came back.

861
00:39:10,737 --> 00:39:13,018
Will I have to go back
to delivering packages again?

862
00:39:16,138 --> 00:39:17,897
If we dig out that wild ginseng,

863
00:39:18,257 --> 00:39:20,778
all our problems will be solved.

864
00:39:21,338 --> 00:39:22,138
Mr Liu,

865
00:39:22,697 --> 00:39:24,818
is eavesdropping your hobby?

866
00:39:25,657 --> 00:39:28,177
I know Tou Tou can find
the way back to that wild ginseng.

867
00:39:28,618 --> 00:39:29,418
How do you...

868
00:39:30,138 --> 00:39:31,177
You left a mark.

869
00:39:31,618 --> 00:39:32,418
I didn't.

870
00:39:38,897 --> 00:39:39,897
Even if I know,

871
00:39:39,977 --> 00:39:41,058
I won't tell you.

872
00:39:41,338 --> 00:39:42,617
Mr Qiu and Master said

873
00:39:42,697 --> 00:39:44,417
that the wild ginseng is blessed by God.

874
00:39:44,497 --> 00:39:46,418
It's not something
to be dug up, you know?

875
00:39:46,818 --> 00:39:48,177
What's wrong with you, Tou Tou?

876
00:39:48,257 --> 00:39:49,937
Have you become foolish studying TCM?

877
00:39:50,858 --> 00:39:52,417
If this apprentice class dissolves,

878
00:39:52,783 --> 00:39:53,956
I don't know about others,

879
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:55,969
but Tian Zhen definitely
has somewhere to go.

880
00:39:56,138 --> 00:39:57,471
I can't say the same for you.

881
00:39:58,618 --> 00:39:59,418
Besides,

882
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,640
if we don't dig up

883
00:40:00,737 --> 00:40:03,257
this wild ginseng, someone else
may discover it and dig it up.

884
00:40:04,417 --> 00:40:06,018
Not everyone is

885
00:40:06,098 --> 00:40:07,218
as trustworthy and honest

886
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,480
as your master.

887
00:40:09,138 --> 00:40:11,058
Young people nowadays
are different from before.

888
00:40:11,697 --> 00:40:14,480
If we dig up this wild ginseng,
we can use it for a proper purpose.

889
00:40:14,538 --> 00:40:15,778
If you encounter someone

890
00:40:16,058 --> 00:40:17,458
with ulterior motives

891
00:40:17,538 --> 00:40:18,697
and no integrity,

892
00:40:18,937 --> 00:40:21,217
you can't even imagine
what the outcome might be.

893
00:40:21,378 --> 00:40:23,017
I don't know. I've forgotten the way.

894
00:40:25,577 --> 00:40:26,377
Mr Liu,

895
00:40:26,937 --> 00:40:27,897
if we really find

896
00:40:27,977 --> 00:40:28,897
the wild ginseng,

897
00:40:29,378 --> 00:40:31,490
can you guarantee that
you will keep the TCM Park?

898
00:40:32,217 --> 00:40:33,017
Ren Tian Zhen!

899
00:40:33,257 --> 00:40:34,298
I can't guarantee

900
00:40:34,378 --> 00:40:35,497
that we can keep the park,

901
00:40:35,737 --> 00:40:37,018
but I can guarantee

902
00:40:37,098 --> 00:40:38,498
that we can give this wild ginseng

903
00:40:38,578 --> 00:40:40,377
to the person who helps me

904
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,800
fill the financial hole.

905
00:40:42,257 --> 00:40:44,030
As long as my park's land
is not mortgaged,

906
00:40:44,298 --> 00:40:46,098
I will offer this whole park
for your use.

907
00:40:46,618 --> 00:40:47,418
Okay.

908
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:48,578
It's a deal.

909
00:40:48,897 --> 00:40:50,057
-Wait...
-It's a deal.

910
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,320
It's a deal.

911
00:40:51,384 --> 00:40:52,577
There is no deal!

912
00:40:52,657 --> 00:40:54,457
Did I say yes?
How dare you say it's a deal!

913
00:40:54,937 --> 00:40:56,578
-Get out.
-I'll wait for you at the door.

914
00:41:02,417 --> 00:41:03,337
Are you crazy?

915
00:41:03,417 --> 00:41:04,538
Have you lost your mind?

916
00:41:04,657 --> 00:41:05,857
How can you disobey your dad?

917
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,240
Don't you know the consequence?

918
00:41:07,338 --> 00:41:08,538
I am different from my dad.

919
00:41:09,177 --> 00:41:11,516
I believe in fate, but I also think
I should do my best.

920
00:41:11,618 --> 00:41:13,738
You and many other students in our class

921
00:41:13,818 --> 00:41:15,550
can't afford to lose
the apprentice class.

922
00:41:15,858 --> 00:41:17,538
You all have to listen to my dad,

923
00:41:17,858 --> 00:41:18,858
but I can choose not to.

924
00:41:22,543 --> 00:41:23,543
No, no.

925
00:41:24,217 --> 00:41:25,257
No.

926
00:41:25,338 --> 00:41:26,217
Let me tell you,

927
00:41:26,457 --> 00:41:27,657
this is called disrespecting
your master.

928
00:41:27,737 --> 00:41:29,338
Even if we find the wild ginseng,

929
00:41:29,578 --> 00:41:30,938
even if we dig it up,

930
00:41:31,018 --> 00:41:32,978
even if the apprentice class is saved,

931
00:41:33,058 --> 00:41:33,858
let me tell you,

932
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,577
your dad will expel us,

933
00:41:35,657 --> 00:41:36,497
you know?

934
00:41:36,858 --> 00:41:37,937
Not us,

935
00:41:38,497 --> 00:41:39,297
just me.

936
00:41:40,338 --> 00:41:42,390
I am doing this for the greater good,
not for personal reasons.

937
00:41:42,578 --> 00:41:43,378
Besides,

938
00:41:43,538 --> 00:41:45,457
even if my dad wants to kick me out,

939
00:41:45,737 --> 00:41:46,818
will my mum let him?

940
00:41:47,058 --> 00:41:47,858
Right?

941
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,280
I will go.

942
00:41:58,796 --> 00:41:59,597
I will go.

943
00:41:59,937 --> 00:42:00,978
You should stay.

944
00:42:01,058 --> 00:42:02,837
Even if someone will be kicked out,
let it be me.

945
00:42:05,457 --> 00:42:06,870
Do you know how to dig ginseng?

946
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,760
There are many rules and techniques
to digging ginseng.

947
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,919
Do you know that you have to mark
the boundaries before digging ginseng?

948
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,297
Do you know that you can't use
iron tools for digging ginseng?

949
00:42:14,378 --> 00:42:16,697
Do you know that you can't
break the roots of the ginseng?

950
00:42:16,858 --> 00:42:17,864
You don't know, do you?

951
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:27,298
I guess I have to bring you along then.

952
00:42:36,006 --> 00:42:37,605
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

953
00:42:37,686 --> 00:42:39,086
(are referenced from relevant
traditional Chinese medicine books)

954
00:42:39,173 --> 00:42:40,299
