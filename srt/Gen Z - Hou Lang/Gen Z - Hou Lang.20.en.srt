1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,040
When we stay at home

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,520
during our off days,

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,800
we chat

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,095
(and eat together.)

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,397
(When I come back late
from my night shift,)

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,197
(he would wait for me
in that little alley.)

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,520
(It's really heart-warming.)

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,680
(But every time I have
this kind of thought,)

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,160
I pull myself back.

10
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,019
I...

11
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,120
I can't.

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,800
I can't choose him.

13
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,200
Because of his family background.

14
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,240
If I choose to be with him,

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,920
I'll be carrying a burden
for a lifetime.

16
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,597
When I'm alone,

17
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,045
I'm paddling a boat alone.

18
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,240
It's already tiring enough.

19
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,120
I don't plan to tie myself down
with a rope.

20
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,000
Why... Why are you
looking at me like that?

21
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,240
I'm not a vain person.

22
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,440
I just don't want
too many responsibilities.

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,600
I think if being together with him

24
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,240
is exhausting,

25
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,640
I'd rather be alone.

26
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,760
Being together with someone

27
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,120
at least offers more solutions
than being alone.

28
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,640
Not to mention

29
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,640
that he's a pretty nice guy.

30
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,320
He decocted medicine for you.

31
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,877
I can get that delivered

32
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,077
by paying ten yuan.

33
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,917
That's not enough
to trade for my lifelong happiness.

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,320
Lifelong happiness is achieved
through the joint efforts of two people.

35
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,280
I'm telling you,
Zhao Li Quan is quite hard-working.

36
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,120
I mean it.

37
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,560
I think he will

38
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,397
make achievement within a few years.

39
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,480
He may even become
a self-made man, right?

40
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,520
Be patient with him.

41
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,480
But then again,

42
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,440
I think the most important thing is

43
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,800
whether

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,800
you really

45
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,560
like him or not.

46
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,960
I think love is a luxury for me.

47
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,360
And I can't afford it.

48
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,880
Tian Xing Xing,

49
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,320
I never realised you placed
such importance on conditions.

50
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,037
If you value conditions so much,

51
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,237
there's a saying that opportunities
favour those who are near.

52
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,037
Why don't you look for one
in your own hospital?

53
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,320
I would love to find one,

54
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,917
but who would be interested in me?

55
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,317
The people who joined our hospital
are all PhD holders.

56
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,160
They are the cream of the crop.

57
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,000
They are considered rare resources
in the eyes of local women.

58
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,557
So, why would they want to choose
someone from another city like me?

59
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,640
This city has a chain of contempt.

60
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,160
That's why

61
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,797
men can't find partners,
and women can't find partners either.

62
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,040
Nowadays, people aren't deciding on
relationships based on feelings,

63
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,760
but rather on conditions.

64
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,080
Everyone wants

65
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,400
to pursue someone slightly
better than themselves.

66
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,400
In that case, let's all stay single.

67
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,200
Enough about me.

68
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,040
You haven't found anyone either, right?

69
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,360
If it's hard for you to find someone,
how would it be easy for me?

70
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,760
At the very least,
you need to have some roots.

71
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,400
I don't even have that.

72
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,440
Moreover,

73
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,280
I don't even have a family.
I have nothing. How can I find someone?

74
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,037
You have nothing?

75
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,240
You're already a successor.

76
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,517
I'm living my days like a character
in a martial arts novel now.

77
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,600
One moment I'm a successor,
and the next moment...

78
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,560
I'm telling you,

79
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,277
I don't want to think about
anything else right now.

80
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,720
I don't have the heart for that.

81
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,000
All I want is to master this practice.

82
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,640
And I genuinely feel
a sense of mission now.

83
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,560
I just want

84
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,920
to focus on my learning

85
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,320
and promote TCM.

86
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,520
You're getting serious?

87
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,960
This is unlike you.

88
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,320
What about your original intention?

89
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,477
I'm talking about Ren Tian Zhen.

90
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,960
Didn't you join back then
because you were attracted to him?

91
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,160
Oh, him?

92
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,640
What's wrong?

93
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,160
He likes Meng Meng.

94
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,320
His mum thinks so too.

95
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,600
I think so too.

96
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,640
So, it's just...

97
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,800
And besides,

98
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,000
if you don't even like Zhao Li Quan,

99
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,880
someone like me,

100
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,880
even if I manage to achieve something,
would his family accept me?

101
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,840
It's all about matching social status.

102
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,160
Don't give me that.

103
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,560
What happened to the fearless
and bold Sun Tou Tou from before?

104
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,317
Now you're restrained

105
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,317
by such worldly matters

106
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,517
like social status.

107
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,080
Does being fearless
mean you can have everything?

108
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,920
I also want those expensive bags
in the mall worth tens of thousands.

109
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,797
I also want those houses
worth two or three millions.

110
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,680
But can I have them just
by wishing for them?

111
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,120
That's why

112
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,400
I have to secure the inheritance

113
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,557
as a successor,

114
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,240
which is like a pie from the sky.

115
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,440
True.

116
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,360
For people like us,

117
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,077
who don't even have crumbs,

118
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,160
why bother considering

119
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,400
choosing between love and bread?

120
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,720
Tou Tou,

121
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,360
if neither of us find someone
when we're old,

122
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,320
let's live together.

123
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,200
I'll cook,

124
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,600
and you'll do the dishes.

125
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,480
You'll perform acupuncture,
and I'll provide caretaking service.

126
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,640
Okay.

127
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,997
Okay.

128
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:13,880
How about

129
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,760
I'll cook and you'll do the dishes?

130
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,077
Okay, okay.

131
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,720
-Okay?
-As long as we are together.

132
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,080
As long as we are together.

133
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,760
Cut it out already.

134
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,520
You're so melodramatic.

135
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,520
I heard from my aunt

136
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,800
that you had a chance to be promoted
to attending physician this year, right?

137
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,640
There is nothing certain in this world.

138
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,757
The title is vain.

139
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,800
I understand that.

140
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,837
In your tertiary hospital, they look
at your accumulated experience.

141
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,640
And there are
limited positions available.

142
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,917
What about next year?

143
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,637
Your promotion should
be certain then, right?

144
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,717
I heard that after becoming
an attending physician,

145
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,997
many private hospitals
will try to recruit doctors like you.

146
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,240
Excuse me?

147
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,640
Mr He,

148
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,040
please calm down.

149
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,277
Since we've chosen
to go on a blind date,

150
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,200
it's definitely different
from love dating.

151
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,440
So, there's no need for us
to test each other.

152
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,757
I don't like

153
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,240
flirting games.

154
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,557
I believe you are also not someone
who doesn't know what you're after

155
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,760
and are seeking true love.

156
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,760
So, let's be straightforward
with each other.

157
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,680
Fine.

158
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,960
If I may say...

159
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,080
Don't get me wrong.

160
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,600
I was thinking that,

161
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,200
you haven't bought a house, right?

162
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,917
The pay at private hospitals
is better than public hospitals.

163
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,440
I heard that being a paediatrician

164
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,440
at a private hospital can be
very lucrative.

165
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,520
Do you have a family history
of genetic diseases?

166
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,600
No.

167
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,997
Do you have a house?

168
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:45,880
Yes, I do.

169
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,600
It's big enough for a family of three.

170
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,040
Will you agree to do
pre-marital health check-up?

171
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,320
I can do that,

172
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,720
but will you cover the cost?

173
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,997
How much is your salary?

174
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,160
Since I proposed it,
of course I would pay for it,

175
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,797
but I haven't been working

176
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,760
for some time.

177
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,080
No job?

178
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,640
How do you support yourself?

179
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,197
Do you have a mortgage?

180
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,600
Do you have any plans about
your future career and family?

181
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,800
Not really.

182
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,200
-How many children do you want?
-I haven't thought about that.

183
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,320
I paid off my mortgage a long time ago.

184
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,440
I'm living off my previous income.

185
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,437
I had a stable income before,

186
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,800
earning three million a year.

187
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,720
Three million?

188
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,200
That's great!

189
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,400
I have no issues with you.

190
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,080
Why are you asking all these questions?

191
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,720
To be honest,

192
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,877
I divorced my ex-wife
without getting a penny.

193
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,400
I'm currently renting a house.

194
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,680
You have a house and no mortgage.

195
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,160
I'm very satisfied with you.

196
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,517
Okay.

197
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,480
We can carry on then.

198
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,280
Are you busy now?

199
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,040
Are you busy with your work?

200
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,237
-It's okay.
-I'm not really busy.

201
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,557
I have a lot of time

202
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,680
to spare.

203
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,560
Please stand up.

204
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,600
Spin around.

205
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,120
Slowly, again.

206
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,480
Okay. Please sit down.

207
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,280
I have three forms here.

208
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,880
Please fill them out.

209
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,120
International Standard IQ Test.

210
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,520
MBTI Career Personality Test.

211
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,280
Cattell's 16 Personality Factors Test.

212
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,560
What are these?

213
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,640
I may need to clarify a bit more.

214
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,280
I'm not looking for
a marriage partner for myself.

215
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,920
I'm looking for a father
for my future child.

216
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,720
Or you could say I want
a child through marriage.

217
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,120
Do you understand?

218
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,200
I do.

219
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,200
Very clearly.

220
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,720
So if we are mutually satisfied
with each other,

221
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,157
I will have it notarized.

222
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,000
I want to make this clear in advance.

223
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,757
What if there are problems

224
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,960
after we have a child?

225
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,960
What will you do then?

226
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,240
You won't choke
the child to death, will you?

227
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,000
I won't,

228
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,520
but I will choke you to death.

229
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,840
What is your hobby?

230
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:08,840
I...

231
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,437
I like to cook.

232
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,440
Do you like watching movies
or listening to song?

233
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,517
Do you like to travel?

234
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,840
Yeah, yeah.

235
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,640
I have everything you want.

236
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,600
You meet all my requirements.

237
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,840
How about we make it official today?

238
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,080
Wait.

239
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,840
Are you severely nearsighted?

240
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:30,037
I used to be nearsighted.
I've had LASIK surgery.

241
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,917
Now both of my eyes are 1.5.

242
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,997
I'm sorry, we're not compatible.

243
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,480
-You don't meet my requirements.
-Hold on.

244
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,920
How am I suddenly not compatible?

245
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,237
You're severely nearsighted,

246
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,197
and your parents are also
severely nearsighted.

247
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,717
Nearsightedness has a high chance of

248
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,040
being inherited according to genetics.

249
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,280
No way.

250
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,960
Nearsightedness can be inherited?

251
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,560
Are you joking with me?

252
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,357
In case my child wants
to become a pilot in the future,

253
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,400
I don't want him to be
hindered by your genes.

254
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,960
I'm sorry, Mr Cao.

255
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,637
I have another appointment coming up.

256
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,640
If you have nothing else to discuss,
please feel free to leave.

257
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,397
Do you really think you're the one
who gets to choose here?

258
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,517
In the dating market,

259
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,717
being in your thirties
with a high education and high income

260
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,800
is actually considered
a drawback for women.

261
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,157
If you want to find someone
to be a father to your child,

262
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,880
you also need to consider whether
they find you desirable as a mother.

263
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,760
Can you help me clean up
the trash, please?

264
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,400
What's the matter?

265
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,960
Sorry.

266
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,677
I think you were right.

267
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,957
An insignificant doctor like me
really has no future.

268
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,117
I'd hate to delay your search
for a rich husband.

269
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,840
I have something else to do today.

270
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,837
Let's call it a day.

271
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,800
I just saw a friend.
I'm going to her.

272
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,120
Hold on. And this too.

273
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,080
Thank you.

274
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,840
Keep up, guys.

275
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,240
Hurry up!

276
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,960
Watch your step.

277
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,040
Tou Tou.

278
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,200
Hurry up.

279
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,997
You're exerting too much
physical energy like this.

280
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,557
Endurance is what matters in running,
not just bursts of energy.

281
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,597
I just burst out once,

282
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,877
take a break, and then burst out again.
That's how I go faster.

283
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,957
Suit yourself.

284
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,320
Don't whine when you get tired.

285
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,800
Slow down.

286
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,680
Master is behind us.

287
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,320
Mr Qiu,

288
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,360
why did we come all the way to
this remote deep mountain forest?

289
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,760
To see treasures.

290
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,440
Treasures?

291
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,680
What treasures are there?

292
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,520
This mountain is full of treasures.

293
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,680
Look.

294
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,840
Look at this tree.

295
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,600
What about it?

296
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,640
It's a pine tree.

297
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,320
Pine trees are full of treasures.

298
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,760
I know.

299
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,120
Pine needle tea,

300
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,880
pine needle infused liquor,

301
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,680
-right?
-And there are also pine knots,

302
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,200
also known as pine nodes.

303
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,560
Don't underestimate them.

304
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,080
If someone with tooth decay

305
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,720
experiences toothache,

306
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,200
using it to boil water for rinsing

307
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,360
can help

308
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,120
alleviate the pain.

309
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,040
Hang on.

310
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,840
Check this out.

311
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,440
What is this?

312
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,280
Look at this. This is

313
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,920
Zazhi (a type of fungus).

314
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:33,880
Zazhi?

315
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,480
Oh, I know.

316
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,397
This is the pine tree's poop, right?

317
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,280
Nonsense.

318
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,237
Students, come here for a second.

319
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,157
-Come here.
-Come.

320
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,760
We found a poop.

321
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,920
-Pine tree's poop.
-Come here now.

322
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,520
Give it to me.

323
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,240
This is a type of fungus

324
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,280
that parasitizes on pine trees.

325
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,000
When it grows on

326
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,760
or under a tree like this,

327
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,240
we call it

328
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,080
Artist's bracket.

329
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,477
If the host tree

330
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,560
is not poisonous,

331
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,840
the Artist's bracket growing on it

332
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,280
has high medicinal value.

333
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,560
For example,

334
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,280
this Zazhi growing on this pine tree

335
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,520
can be used for liver protection.

336
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,597
So, does that mean

337
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,040
we can find Lingzhi everywhere?

338
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,440
Artist's bracket

339
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,560
grown on different hosts

340
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,600
has different effects.

341
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,560
Some

342
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,840
may not reach
the level of medicinal use,

343
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,080
while some

344
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,800
are extremely rare.

345
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,240
For example, Sanghuang is a type

346
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,360
of Artist's bracket
that grows on mulberry trees.

347
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,797
Nature has provided us

348
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,200
with many treasures,

349
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,880
including ginseng.

350
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,600
So, we might

351
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,880
come across ginseng today.

352
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,880
-There is ginseng in this area?
-Of course.

353
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,120
What are you doing?

354
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,520
I'm praying to come across
a ginseng later.

355
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,960
What do you want ginseng for?

356
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,317
Didn't Bone Zhu always have

357
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,560
a strong desire to eat ginseng before?

358
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,517
I was thinking that
if I come across it today,

359
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,080
I will bring one back for him.

360
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,800
Don't be greedy.

361
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,920
Ginseng is also known as "earth spirit".

362
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,320
For example, if there is one
ginseng plant in this area,

363
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,760
then there won't be

364
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,880
any others for several years.

365
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,760
It absorbs all the earth's energy.

366
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,197
So, if we need it, we use it.

367
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,120
If we don't need it, we should
leave it for someone who does.

368
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,120
This way, we also conserve
the earth's energy.

369
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,760
-Let's go.
-Okay. Let's go.

370
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,837
-I'll lead the way!
-Okay!

371
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,477
Watch your step.

372
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,480
Slow down, slow down.

373
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,757
Sorry, this seat is taken.

374
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,280
Since your next date isn't here yet,
why don't you give me a chance?

375
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,277
Why are you here?
What are you doing here?

376
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,720
Whatever you are doing here,
I'm doing the same thing.

377
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,917
I didn't expect someone like you
would fail in a blind date.

378
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,960
Whatever.

379
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,040
I'm not rushing to get married.
It's my parents who are pressuring me.

380
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,320
You, on the other hand,

381
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,077
you skipped the apprentice class

382
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,597
to come here for blind dates.

383
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,117
Why? Are you that urgent?

384
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,157
The class can wait.

385
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,440
Learning is a lifelong process.

386
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,000
This is more urgent.

387
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,357
Biology doesn't allow me to wait.

388
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,440
I want a blood relative.

389
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,437
You weren't in a rush
for the first 30 years.

390
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,077
How did you suddenly
come to this realisation?

391
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,960
Yes, I just did.

392
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,200
So, please don't disturb me, okay?
Thanks.

393
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,040
Let me take a look
at your requirements.

394
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,280
Education level.

395
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,880
Is this from the Ministry of Education
or an international one?

396
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,760
IQ Index.

397
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,360
Don't tell me you even prepared
a set of Mensa test questions.

398
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,320
You did prepare it.

399
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,917
Height, family history of disease,

400
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,037
bad habits,

401
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,960
physical health condition.

402
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,997
Even the interviews at
the top 500 global companies

403
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,440
don't cover all these questions.

404
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,120
The age difference of up to
ten years is acceptable.

405
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,760
If it's ten years younger,
are they even of legal marriage age?

406
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,680
It's right at 22 years old.

407
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,200
I actually meet your criteria.

408
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,960
How about we give it a try?

409
00:17:12,312 --> 00:17:13,413
Just think about it.

410
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,597
In my case, my parents
are eager for grandchildren,

411
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,517
and you want a child of your own.

412
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,320
The three of you share the same goal.

413
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,320
I am

414
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,760
sacrificing myself for it.

415
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:24,920
You're not suitable.

416
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,760
Why am I not suitable? I'm healthy.
I have no bad habits.

417
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,037
I've even done all these tests before.
I definitely meet the standard.

418
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,120
Your health is not up to par.

419
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,400
Firstly, your work condition
doesn't meet the standards.

420
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,997
You're not even qualified
to donate sperm.

421
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,597
If you want to meet my standards,

422
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,757
you must resign

423
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,477
and rest at home for at least three
months or more to improve your health.

424
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,160
If you can't do that,
then you're not suitable.

425
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,637
Well, then you shouldn't be here
looking for a partner.

426
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,800
Just go directly to the sperm bank
and pick out some sperm.

427
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,437
I want to at least
check out the looks.

428
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,757
My looks are quite good.

429
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:51,640
Look at me.

430
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,117
(Mr Fu: Sorry, Ms Yang.)

431
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,360
(Something came up today.
Let's meet some other time.)

432
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,440
Are you free later?

433
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,720
What do you want to do?

434
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,037
Don't you want to go on
a blind date with me?

435
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,160
I'm giving you a chance.

436
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,000
What about your date?

437
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,040
He's not coming.

438
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,357
-Are you coming?
-Yes.

439
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,360
Let's go.

440
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,877
You haven't even found
a father of your baby yet.

441
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,800
Don't you think
it's too early to buy these?

442
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,440
I'm visiting Chen Hui and her son later.

443
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,040
I can't go empty-handed, can I?

444
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,880
Why do you need me here then?

445
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,880
You can be my advisor.

446
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,280
Aren't you a professional?

447
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,760
You pick the gifts. I will pay for them.

448
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:35,920
All right.

449
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,160
These shoes are cute!

450
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,440
Look.

451
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,237
Chen Hui's baby was just born

452
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,840
before the Spring Festival, right?

453
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:45,880
Yes.

454
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,720
Then these aren't suitable.

455
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,800
Why?

456
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,557
These are for one-year-old babies.

457
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,520
A one-month-old baby
can't wear them at all.

458
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,960
If you want to be a mother,
besides finding a father,

459
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,800
you've got a lot to learn.

460
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,440
Wait here.

461
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,560
This one.

462
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,717
The baby's vision is not
fully developed yet,

463
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,800
so they need more visual
and auditory stimulation.

464
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,720
Even if the mother is asleep at night,
the baby won't feel lonely.

465
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,000
And this.

466
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,280
You see, it lights up and plays music,

467
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,240
which helps with auditory development.

468
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,400
And this one

469
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,757
is for tactile stimulation,

470
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,840
the baby can grasp it.

471
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:58,880
This one too.

472
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,757
Oh, and please don't buy

473
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,037
common items
like blankets, clothes, pacifiers.

474
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,600
They're piling up like a truckload.

475
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,600
But these are too little.

476
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,557
Isn't there

477
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,517
a popular pillow that shapes

478
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,477
the baby's head into

479
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,557
a nice shape these days?

480
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,077
Milady, the bones of a newborn baby
are very soft.

481
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,597
Their spine is straight
for the first three months

482
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,400
without any physiological curvature.

483
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,637
If you give them a pillow,
it will make them uncomfortable.

484
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,760
-But...
-All right. Don't say another word.

485
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,280
The so-called head shaping
is just using a towel

486
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,400
to cushion

487
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,040
and secure it.

488
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,240
Just like this.

489
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,560
Okay. Say nothing.

490
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,680
Leave the task of choosing gifts
to me, a professional paediatrician.

491
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:47,960
I didn't realise

492
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,520
before that you are
a professional doctor.

493
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,560
Today, you seem like one.

494
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,960
I also realised today

495
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,720
that you are quite detached
from worldly matters, Ms. Yang.

496
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,120
These are all you need.

497
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,760
-Let's pay for them.
-Let's go.

498
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,920
These are so expensive!

499
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,677
Are babies cash-eating monsters?

500
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,560
What did you expect?

501
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,797
Now you can experience it in advance.

502
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,920
And it will put an end
to your matchmaking plans.

503
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,760
Even if they are cash-eating monster,
I still want one.

504
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:19,640
WeChat Pay, thank you.

505
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,880
Oh, my God. His skin is so fair.

506
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,720
He is smiling!

507
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,680
He knows

508
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,960
that his lifesaver has come to see him.

509
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,440
He likes you.

510
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,397
Naughty boy,

511
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,000
did you know that you were mischievous?

512
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,757
You were in such a hurry

513
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,800
to come out of your mum's belly.

514
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,117
Your mummy endured a lot of pain
to give birth to you.

515
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:48,997
When you grow up,

516
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,400
you must be a good son, okay?

517
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,920
What's his name?

518
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,680
Kong Nian Yuan.

519
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,840
Kong Nian Hong.

520
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,037
You saved

521
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,200
both of our lives.

522
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,597
I want him to remember it

523
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,920
and always be grateful to you.

524
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,720
I also want you to be his godmother.

525
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,760
Will you say yes?

526
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,920
You have to say yes.

527
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,080
You're so intelligent and outstanding.

528
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,757
You succeed in anything you do.

529
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,637
Look at you,

530
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,717
transitioning from a lawyer
to a TCM practitioner.

531
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,560
It's boundary-crossing.

532
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,640
That's why I want our child

533
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,000
to also benefit from your blessings.

534
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,320
I'm not as great
as you make me out to be.

535
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,640
I'm doing this

536
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,360
as a way of redemption.

537
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,080
It wasn't your fault.

538
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,840
Professor Ren said

539
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,880
it was impermanence.

540
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:57,920
I couldn't

541
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,760
accept Zhi Yuan's sudden passing before.

542
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,960
I thought blaming you

543
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,720
would alleviate my own inner pain.

544
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,240
Now, with our child here,

545
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,160
looking at this little face,

546
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,880
I realised that

547
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,200
God won't leave us

548
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,840
without a way forward.

549
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,880
It takes,

550
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,000
but it also gives.

551
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,240
I will always remember that day

552
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:33,320
when you tightly wrapped
me and my son in clothes,

553
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,237
(while you stood in the cold wind)

554
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,880
(with just a single layer of clothing.)

555
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,240
Despite my harsh words
towards you at that time,

556
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,440
you still responded with love.

557
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,320
It was

558
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,920
at the moment when you saved my son

559
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,200
that I realised

560
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,960
you are my saviour.

561
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,240
Nian Hong,

562
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,560
I'm your godmother.

563
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,640
Do you know me?

564
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,640
Why is it "Nian Hong"?

565
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,080
Why does a boy's name
have the character for "red"?

566
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,880
Because his godmother's name
is Yang Xiao Hong.

567
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,160
Nian Hong.

568
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,240
Nian Hong.

569
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,680
This road is not easy to walk.

570
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,040
It's much easier to walk than before.

571
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,760
Mr Qiu,

572
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,560
the treasure is hidden
so deep in the forest.

573
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,960
Common people won't be able
to find it for sure.

574
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,800
We usually don't come to this area.

575
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,160
It's too easy to get lost.

576
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,077
-Be careful, Professor Ren.
-Okay.

577
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,320
Then why did we come today?

578
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,920
Over a decade ago,

579
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,360
when Mr Qiu came here,

580
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,637
he left a mark on
a wild ginseng plant here

581
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,040
by tying a red string around it.

582
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,320
But later on,

583
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,840
no one was able to see
that wild ginseng plant again.

584
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,960
However, a few days ago,
I rediscovered that wild ginseng plant.

585
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,677
The red string tied around it

586
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,960
was all torn and tattered,

587
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,517
but I still recognized it
at first glance.

588
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,560
So, I notified Mr Qiu immediately.

589
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,320
When I first

590
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,960
saw it back then,

591
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,237
it was already the size of a hand.

592
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,920
So many years have passed since then,

593
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,560
I wonder how it has grown.

594
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:40,957
If we all get

595
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,720
to see this treasure today,

596
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,080
it's all thanks to you.

597
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,320
Okay. Let's go.

598
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,320
Let's go.

599
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,360
Be careful.

600
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,400
What's...

601
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,200
What's so special about this treasure?

602
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,400
It's extremely challenging
for a ginseng plant to grow,

603
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,400
especially wild ginseng.

604
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,280
The leaf whorls of wild ginseng
grow at the end of the stem.

605
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,200
Five small leaves
make up one palm-sized ginseng.

606
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,157
Conservatively, it takes
at least ten years

607
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,517
for a ginseng to reach the stage
of having five leaves,

608
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,597
but the exact age

609
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,597
of the ginseng is determined
based on the ginseng pattern and body.

610
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,040
The legendary millennium ginseng
is even rarer.

611
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,000
It is said that in the 1990s,
during an auction in Hong Kong,

612
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,677
half of a millennium ginseng plant

613
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,800
was sold for a sky-high price
of 200 million yuan.

614
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,197
In that case,

615
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,320
does that mean

616
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,200
it's a big fortune if we find one?

617
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Wait for me!

618
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,360
Wait for me!

619
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,837
Professor Ren, Mr Qiu,
it should be in front.

620
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,957
-Be careful.
-Okay.

621
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:07,920
Those behind, keep up.

622
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,640
-Okay.
-Here, easy.

623
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,880
Keep up, guys.

624
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,677
Professor Ren, Mr Qiu!

625
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,117
Professor Ren, Mr Qiu, look!

626
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,800
-I found it.
-You did?

627
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,520
Is it that one?

628
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,680
-Let me see.
-The red string.

629
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,960
Easy, easy.

630
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,240
Easy.

631
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,560
So, this is the millennium monster?

632
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,360
I mean, millennium ginseng?

633
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,080
It's the string I tied.

634
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:37,040
Yes, it's the wild ginseng plant
I saw back then.

635
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:37,797
No.

636
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,040
This is an opportunity
we couldn't wish for more.

637
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,120
It's also my first time seeing this.

638
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,797
Mr Qiu, can we dig it up now?

639
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,357
Do we need to do some kind of ceremony?

640
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,480
If we don't dig it now,
what if it's gone again?

641
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,600
Let me explain first.

642
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,160
This ginseng

643
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,400
is a perennial herbaceous plant.

644
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,517
During winter,

645
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,440
it withers and goes into dormancy.

646
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,000
We call it "false death."

647
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,117
When it encounters unfavourable
climate conditions for growth,

648
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,680
it can remain dormant
throughout the year.

649
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,240
So,

650
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,117
it's truly a miracle for us

651
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,677
to come across a wild ginseng

652
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,160
that's nearly a hundred years old.

653
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,960
What are we waiting for then?
Let's dig it out now.

654
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,920
We must first pay homage
to the mountain god.

655
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,077
Pay homage
to the mountain god.

656
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,520
Master. Master.

657
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,200
Mr Qiu, Professor Ren,

658
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,160
we must not dig up this ginseng!

659
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,677
-Let's return the way we came!
-We are returning the way we came!

660
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,560
Okay, let's go.

661
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:58,920
Hang on.

662
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,197
Why are we going back?

663
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,440
We have to dig it up, Master!

664
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,400
We really shouldn't dig it up!

665
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,197
Look, this ginseng should be
protected by a god.

666
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,160
We chanted toward it together. And look,

667
00:29:09,244 --> 00:29:11,338
the weather changed immediately.

668
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,757
It's telling us that we need to
leave it where it is.

669
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,765
Mr Qiu,

670
00:29:14,849 --> 00:29:16,080
the same thing happened last time.

671
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,200
We were just about to dig it out,
and a thunderbolt nearly struck me.

672
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,197
We gave up right away.

673
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:23,597
-Let's go. We can't dig it up.
-That's superstition.

674
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,437
-We have to dig it out!
-No, we can't.

675
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,477
-Let's go.
-It's okay.

676
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,360
Listen,

677
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,800
we must have reverence for nature.

678
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,240
This place could collapse when it rains.

679
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,277
-Let's go now. Come on.
-But it worth millions.

680
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,277
Let's go now.

681
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,317
-Millions!
-Give Professor Ren a hand.

682
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,200
Let's go.

683
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,520
We are just going to leave it there?

684
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,120
Your life worth more than that. Come on!

685
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,520
-There is nothing to be afraid of.
-Come on!

686
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,160
Hurry up!

687
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,960
-Let's go!
-No!

688
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,720
Come on!

689
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,640
Yang Xiao Hong!

690
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,000
Rebecca.

691
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,800
Yang Xiao Hong.

692
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,397
Yang Xiao Hong! Rebecca.

693
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,880
Will you ever stop?

694
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,997
Why do you hide your Chinese name?

695
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,360
Your name sounds so nice.

696
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,680
It's simple and easy to pronounce.

697
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,280
I'm afraid everyone will react
the same way as you.

698
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,240
It's annoying.

699
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,440
You will be a good mother.

700
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,160
I don't even know
who my baby's father is.

701
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,080
It doesn't matter who he is.

702
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,960
You will still be a good mother.

703
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:36,983
Meng Meng!

704
00:31:38,013 --> 00:31:39,016
Meng Meng!

705
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,077
-We're back!
-You're back.

706
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,076
You know,

707
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,797
we saw a millennium ginseng

708
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,760
worth a few million yuan.

709
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,720
Show it to me.

710
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,757
We didn't bring it back.
We were so close to digging it out.

711
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,680
They wouldn't let us dig it out.

712
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,157
Ms Song said this is good
for dispelling cold. Have some.

713
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,800
-This too?
-Yes.

714
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,357
Have some ginger soup, everyone.

715
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,957
I wonder what that
a few million yuan ginseng

716
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,800
would taste like
if it was boiled in soup.

717
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,920
-Is it that old?
-Yes.

718
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,520
Have some water.

719
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,520
-Thank you.
-What are you doing here?

720
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,560
Professor,

721
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,040
we are in trouble.

722
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,200
The TCM Park is in jeopardy.

723
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,480
It has reached
a critical point of survival.

724
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,837
Professor, do you remember

725
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,957
the last time I went abroad to negotiate

726
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,277
for the distributorship deal
of a new medicine?

727
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,400
Yes, I remember.

728
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,240
Didn't you already get the deal?

729
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,800
Yes,

730
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,440
at first I thought that

731
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,677
if I could introduce this cutting-edge
technology to the country,

732
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:41,160
I would be the first distributor
of the new medicine.

733
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,040
But who would have thought

734
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,000
that there was no such a thing?

735
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,797
It's all a sham.

736
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,160
We've all been deceived.

737
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,160
I was supposed to receive the first
batch of medicine after Spring Festival,

738
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,960
but nothing came.

739
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,320
I called the customs office,

740
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,600
and they said that all the logistics
information provided was fake.

741
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,240
It was all virtual shipments.

742
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:06,440
But I had already transferred the
full payment before Spring Festival.

743
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,640
Mr Liu,

744
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,240
didn't you see the medicine

745
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,037
when you went there?

746
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,400
I did see it.

747
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,677
The person who provided me
with the medicine

748
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,437
is my good friend of many years.

749
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,720
He invested in this medicine.

750
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,680
His profit in the first year tripled,

751
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,560
a 300% increase.

752
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,680
He took me to the factory,

753
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,197
showed me the production line,

754
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,837
and introduced other agents
from different countries

755
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,840
who went there like me.

756
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,360
So, I believed him.

757
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,640
But I had no idea that their profits

758
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,440
in the first year
didn't come from selling the medicine,

759
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:42,600
but from the so-called
group commissions.

760
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,960
It's a Ponzi scheme.

761
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:46,920
What?

762
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,000
Hang on.

763
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,400
Hang on, Mr Liu,

764
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,517
do you owe them a lot of money?

765
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,357
I don't owe them any money.
I transferred full payment.

766
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,837
You owe them money.

767
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,037
What does it have to do
with the TCM Park?

768
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,440
What's the use of coming to us?

769
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,640
Mr Liu,

770
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,560
are you saying that

771
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,720
you want to mortgage

772
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,680
the TCM Park?

773
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,640
What?

774
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,837
I can't repay the bank loan,

775
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,280
so I can only mortgage
the land in the park.

776
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,000
Professor,

777
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,200
I really need your help.

778
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,877
If I still have control over this land,

779
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,040
I can continue running the TCM Park.

780
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,877
We can continue negotiations

781
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,200
for the project with Mr Wu.

782
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,597
Your apprentice class

783
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,840
can continue as well.

784
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,680
But if this land is auctioned off,

785
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,837
there's no telling

786
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,040
if we can continue the park.

787
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,640
We are in the same boat now.

788
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,400
Professor,

789
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,560
please figure something out.

790
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,120
This is such a big hole.

791
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,637
What can I do?

792
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,757
I can't figure anything out.

793
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,000
You have a way.

794
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,600
You definitely have a way.

795
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,120
I went all the way

796
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,600
to your house to see you.

797
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,200
When I was looking for you,
your parents-in-law

798
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,360
said that you came here
to find a treasure.

799
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,680
I heard from Tou Tou

800
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,357
that you found

801
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,800
a hundred-year-old wild ginseng,

802
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,160
right?

803
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,240
How could you eavesdrop on
people's conversations?

804
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,440
I'm sorry, Tou Tou.
I'll apologise to you.

805
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,920
The situation is urgent now.

806
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:18,520
Professor, do you remember the time
we had dinner with the investors?

807
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,400
There was a big shot
who admires you a lot.

808
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:23,240
While others collect
cigars and fine wines,

809
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,400
he collects ginseng.

810
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,517
If we bring this wild ginseng to him,

811
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,997
things will turn around.

812
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,760
We can't dig up this wild ginseng.

813
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,440
Besides,

814
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,117
it belongs to Mr Qiu,

815
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,357
not me.

816
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,797
There are rules in the mountains.

817
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,680
Whoever ties the string around it
owns the wild ginseng.

818
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,837
My esteemed professor,
we are having a crisis now.

819
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,237
Anyone can dig it up.

820
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,917
Digging up this wild ginseng

821
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,040
is also a contribution to TCM, isn't it?

822
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,320
I'm sure Mr Qiu can understand, right?

823
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,360
Mr Liu,

824
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,437
the road conditions in these mountains

825
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,160
are extremely dangerous.

826
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,080
Even if we go back now,

827
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,880
we might not find it.

828
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,720
Plus, the weather in the mountains

829
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,437
is changing drastically today.

830
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,621
It's too dangerous.

831
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,248
I will provide the money
to hire the best ginseng farmers.

832
00:36:06,933 --> 00:36:08,541
We can't force it.

833
00:36:08,913 --> 00:36:10,350
Finding the ginseng depends on fate.

834
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,960
If it's not meant to be,
then we shouldn't get it.

835
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,160
Mr Liu,

836
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,200
if you really want a wild ginseng,

837
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,640
a patient of mine

838
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,677
has a wild ginseng plant
that is 40 years old.

839
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,837
I can talk to him about it.

840
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,760
Hold on.

841
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,477
There's a big difference between 40
and 100 years in terms of market value.

842
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,880
They are incomparable.

843
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:30,760
All right now,

844
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,200
the weather isn't good today.

845
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,557
Why don't you stay in
the mountains for the night?

846
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,640
Let's have a meal first.

847
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,440
-Let's have a meal first.
-Yes.

848
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,400
Let's eat.

849
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,306
Tou Tou, let's eat.

850
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,440
Tou Tou has tied fluorescent strings
along the way.

851
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,960
Why did Mr Ren say
it's hard to find the way?

852
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,160
Fluorescent strings?

853
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,080
What's on your mind?

854
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,280
Are you still thinking about the park?

855
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:26,960
So...

856
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,880
If we lose the TCM park,

857
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,680
then our apprentice class
can't continue.

858
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,760
I finally came back.

859
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,920
Will I have to go back
to delivering packages again?

860
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,800
If we dig out that wild ginseng,

861
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,680
all our problems will be solved.

862
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,040
Mr Liu,

863
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,720
is eavesdropping your hobby?

864
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,080
I know Tou Tou can find
the way back to that wild ginseng.

865
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,320
How do you...

866
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,080
You left a mark.

867
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,320
I didn't.

868
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,797
Even if I know,

869
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:05,960
I won't tell you.

870
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,517
Mr Qiu and Master said

871
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,317
that the wild ginseng is blessed by God.

872
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,320
It's not something
to be dug up, you know?

873
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,077
What's wrong with you, Tou Tou?

874
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,840
Have you become foolish studying TCM?

875
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,320
If this apprentice class dissolves,

876
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,840
I don't know about others,

877
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,880
but Tian Zhen definitely
has somewhere to go.

878
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,360
I can't say the same for you.

879
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,320
Besides,

880
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,557
if we don't dig up

881
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:28,160
this wild ginseng, someone else
may discover it and dig it up.

882
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,917
Not everyone is

883
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,120
as trustworthy and honest

884
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,400
as your master.

885
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,960
Young people nowadays
are different from before.

886
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:39,357
If we dig up this wild ginseng,
we can use it for a proper purpose.

887
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,680
If you encounter someone

888
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,357
with ulterior motives

889
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,600
and no integrity,

890
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,120
you can't even imagine
what the outcome might be.

891
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,920
I don't know. I've forgotten the way.

892
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,280
Mr Liu,

893
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,797
if we really find

894
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,800
the wild ginseng,

895
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,400
can you guarantee that
you will keep the TCM Park?

896
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:57,920
Ren Tian Zhen!

897
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,197
I can't guarantee

898
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,400
that we can keep the park,

899
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,917
but I can guarantee

900
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,397
that we can give this wild ginseng

901
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,280
to the person who helps me

902
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,720
fill the financial hole.

903
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,920
As long as my park's land
is not mortgaged,

904
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,000
I will offer this whole park
for your use.

905
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,320
Okay.

906
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,480
It's a deal.

907
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,960
-Wait...
-It's a deal.

908
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,197
It's a deal.

909
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,477
There is no deal!

910
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,360
Did I say yes?
How dare you say it's a deal!

911
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,480
-Get out.
-I'll wait for you at the door.

912
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,237
Are you crazy?

913
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,440
Have you lost your mind?

914
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,757
How can you disobey your dad?

915
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,157
Don't you know the consequence?

916
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,440
I am different from my dad.

917
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,400
I believe in fate, but I also think
I should do my best.

918
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,637
You and many other students in our class

919
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,440
can't afford to lose
the apprentice class.

920
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,440
You all have to listen to my dad,

921
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,760
but I can choose not to.

922
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,440
No, no.

923
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,157
No.

924
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,120
Let me tell you,

925
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,557
this is called disrespecting
your master.

926
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,240
Even if we find the wild ginseng,

927
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,837
even if we dig it up,

928
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,877
even if the apprentice class is saved,

929
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:58,760
let me tell you,

930
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,477
your dad will expel us,

931
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,400
you know?

932
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,840
Not us,

933
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,200
just me.

934
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,280
I am doing this for the greater good,
not for personal reasons.

935
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,280
Besides,

936
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,360
even if my dad wants to kick me out,

937
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:11,720
will my mum let him?

938
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,004
Right?

939
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,318
I will go.

940
00:40:23,686 --> 00:40:24,646
I will go.

941
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,877
You should stay.

942
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,720
Even if someone will be kicked out,
let it be me.

943
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,760
Do you know how to dig ginseng?

944
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,677
There are many rules and techniques
to digging ginseng.

945
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,800
Do you know that you have to mark
the boundaries before digging ginseng?

946
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:39,197
Do you know that you can't use
iron tools for digging ginseng?

947
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,600
Do you know that you can't
break the roots of the ginseng?

948
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,760
You don't know, do you?

949
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,200
I guess I have to bring you along then.

950
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,517
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

951
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,997
(are referenced from relevant
traditional Chinese medicine books)

952
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,160
