1
00:01:30,805 --> 00:01:34,812
(Gen Z)

2
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:37,695
(Episode 28)

3
00:01:44,766 --> 00:01:46,486
I'm not confident
in treating acute abdomen.

4
00:01:47,606 --> 00:01:49,646
It'll be troublesome
if it festers and perforates.

5
00:01:49,846 --> 00:01:51,006
I'll take you to the hospital.

6
00:01:55,086 --> 00:01:56,445
Three hours.

7
00:01:57,445 --> 00:02:00,045
Night traveling
and perforation are both risky.

8
00:02:05,445 --> 00:02:06,166
Tian Zhen.

9
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:09,925
You prescribe medicine.

10
00:02:11,326 --> 00:02:12,046
I'll eat.

11
00:02:16,046 --> 00:02:17,206
Boss, do you have a needle?

12
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:19,405
I'll get acupuncture treatment first.

13
00:02:22,846 --> 00:02:23,765
I have.

14
00:02:24,006 --> 00:02:25,206
Do you know how to do it?

15
00:02:25,405 --> 00:02:26,326
I know.

16
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:30,046
Prescribe the medicine.

17
00:02:33,686 --> 00:02:34,405
This...

18
00:02:37,486 --> 00:02:38,725
He is a TCM practitioner.

19
00:02:39,966 --> 00:02:41,446
A very good one.

20
00:02:42,326 --> 00:02:43,686
You can trust him.

21
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:46,285
He's so young. He doesn't look like one.

22
00:02:47,766 --> 00:02:49,605
It has been running in
his family for 14 generations.

23
00:02:50,766 --> 00:02:52,046
His father is Ren Xin Zheng.

24
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:54,845
He is studying for a Ph.D. at University
of Traditional Chinese Medicine.

25
00:02:57,406 --> 00:02:57,925
This...

26
00:02:58,966 --> 00:03:00,605
You're Ren Xin Zheng's son?

27
00:03:03,245 --> 00:03:03,726
Yes.

28
00:03:05,086 --> 00:03:07,525
Your dad's book is very famous.

29
00:03:07,525 --> 00:03:08,766
What's its name?

30
00:03:08,966 --> 00:03:10,525
"Understanding of TCM", right?

31
00:03:10,525 --> 00:03:11,165
Yes.

32
00:03:11,805 --> 00:03:13,046
We have one at home.

33
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:15,326
Later, please sign the book for me.

34
00:03:15,845 --> 00:03:16,885
-Okay.
-Old He.

35
00:03:16,925 --> 00:03:18,406
Hurry up! Grab the medicine and cook it!

36
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:20,446
-Okay, okay.
-He's really great!

37
00:03:20,925 --> 00:03:23,406
Girl. Go knock on Uncle Niu's door.

38
00:03:23,686 --> 00:03:25,126
Tell him that
his illness can be treated.

39
00:03:25,126 --> 00:03:26,525
We have a great doctor here!

40
00:03:26,525 --> 00:03:27,845
Alright, I'll go now.

41
00:03:27,845 --> 00:03:28,406
Tou Tou.

42
00:03:29,326 --> 00:03:31,126
I've never given
this prescription to anyone before.

43
00:03:31,686 --> 00:03:32,885
Its dose is too strong.

44
00:03:33,126 --> 00:03:34,245
Let's go to the hospital.

45
00:03:40,406 --> 00:03:41,485
I'm not going to the hospital.

46
00:03:45,126 --> 00:03:46,046
I trust you.

47
00:04:24,406 --> 00:04:24,846
Tou Tou.

48
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:27,725
Do you feel better
after getting acupuncture?

49
00:04:29,126 --> 00:04:30,846
I feel like
you can make it to the hospital.

50
00:04:31,206 --> 00:04:32,085
I'll go and drive the car over.

51
00:04:32,846 --> 00:04:34,046
Don't drink this medicine.

52
00:04:42,846 --> 00:04:44,286
What happened?

53
00:04:45,805 --> 00:04:46,605
It's bitter.

54
00:04:47,206 --> 00:04:48,766
The after-taste is strong.

55
00:05:01,805 --> 00:05:02,805
Let me tell you.

56
00:05:04,926 --> 00:05:07,326
If you become
a great doctor in the future,

57
00:05:08,605 --> 00:05:10,365
don't you forget about me.

58
00:05:11,486 --> 00:05:13,645
I'm the first one
who tried your medicine.

59
00:05:14,206 --> 00:05:15,766
I tried it with my life.

60
00:05:16,365 --> 00:05:17,165
Understand?

61
00:05:18,046 --> 00:05:18,846
This is very important.

62
00:05:28,926 --> 00:05:29,645
Sun Tou Tou.

63
00:05:30,365 --> 00:05:31,206
Tou Tou, what's wrong with you?

64
00:05:31,245 --> 00:05:31,885
Tou Tou!

65
00:05:32,326 --> 00:05:33,365
Tou Tou, don't scare me!

66
00:05:33,406 --> 00:05:34,445
Tou Tou, wake up.

67
00:05:34,486 --> 00:05:35,206
Tou Tou!

68
00:05:35,326 --> 00:05:36,365
Tou Tou!

69
00:05:36,525 --> 00:05:37,926
Tou Tou, don't scare me!

70
00:05:44,365 --> 00:05:45,725
Tou Tou, what's the situation now?

71
00:05:45,766 --> 00:05:46,846
Why are you messing around?

72
00:05:47,165 --> 00:05:47,966
I didn't.

73
00:05:47,966 --> 00:05:50,085
I just think that
the atmosphere is tense.

74
00:05:50,126 --> 00:05:51,645
I just want it to be exciting.

75
00:05:51,645 --> 00:05:52,805
I do not like this.

76
00:05:56,365 --> 00:05:57,446
How do you feel now?

77
00:05:57,925 --> 00:05:59,365
Panic.

78
00:05:59,606 --> 00:06:00,525
Why are you panicking?

79
00:06:00,805 --> 00:06:01,525
I...

80
00:06:02,085 --> 00:06:04,126
I'm afraid I'd die
before inheriting the sect.

81
00:06:05,525 --> 00:06:06,126
No, no.

82
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:08,406
Let's go to the hospital now, okay?

83
00:06:08,406 --> 00:06:09,485
No, listen to me.

84
00:06:10,686 --> 00:06:12,205
If I die...

85
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,525
I say, if...

86
00:06:15,245 --> 00:06:17,365
You must take over as the inheritor.

87
00:06:19,686 --> 00:06:22,525
And bury me next to my great-grandma.

88
00:06:23,686 --> 00:06:24,805
Then, carved this on the tomb.

89
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:28,525
"Sacrifice by testing medicine

90
00:06:30,645 --> 00:06:33,765
for a great doctor."

91
00:06:34,765 --> 00:06:35,406
Understand?

92
00:06:39,245 --> 00:06:40,085
I won't.

93
00:06:44,245 --> 00:06:45,805
I will bury you
in the graveyard at my house.

94
00:06:49,245 --> 00:06:50,205
And carved this on the tomb.

95
00:06:55,406 --> 00:06:56,726
"Ma'am, you should take your medicine."

96
00:06:59,365 --> 00:06:59,886
No.

97
00:07:00,126 --> 00:07:02,406
Why am I buried
in the graveyard in your house?

98
00:07:02,406 --> 00:07:05,245
Is it appropriate?

99
00:07:06,525 --> 00:07:07,726
Your life is mine.

100
00:07:10,925 --> 00:07:12,205
Whether you are alive or dead,

101
00:07:14,325 --> 00:07:15,325
you are mine.

102
00:07:20,966 --> 00:07:21,525
What's wrong?

103
00:07:22,645 --> 00:07:23,525
What's the matter, Tou Tou?

104
00:07:23,805 --> 00:07:24,805
Stomach?

105
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:27,126
Don't close the door.

106
00:07:28,245 --> 00:07:28,886
What's wrong?

107
00:07:29,645 --> 00:07:30,566
I'm afraid you'll fall into the pit.

108
00:07:30,686 --> 00:07:32,205
I'm a doctor
and I'm responsible for you.

109
00:07:32,325 --> 00:07:33,846
In case you faint, I'll catch you.

110
00:07:37,525 --> 00:07:38,446
Don't you think it stinks?

111
00:07:39,085 --> 00:07:40,406
If it smells good,
that'd be a problem.

112
00:07:43,805 --> 00:07:45,325
I'll leave a gap then.

113
00:07:49,085 --> 00:07:49,645
Okay.

114
00:08:03,205 --> 00:08:04,085
Have you

115
00:08:04,606 --> 00:08:05,606
figured it out?

116
00:08:08,126 --> 00:08:08,566
This...

117
00:08:09,365 --> 00:08:10,245
About what?

118
00:08:17,686 --> 00:08:18,606
Be mine.

119
00:08:21,686 --> 00:08:22,726
What do you mean?

120
00:08:25,365 --> 00:08:27,645
No one has ever
profess his love to you before?

121
00:08:28,805 --> 00:08:30,166
Profess your love?

122
00:08:31,606 --> 00:08:33,925
I really haven't seen

123
00:08:33,925 --> 00:08:37,286
someone professes love
during defecating.

124
00:08:41,805 --> 00:08:42,726
Well, think about it then.

125
00:09:00,925 --> 00:09:02,365
Do you want Uncle Niu to come now

126
00:09:02,566 --> 00:09:03,925
and let Mr. Ren have a look?

127
00:09:04,045 --> 00:09:04,805
No, no.

128
00:09:04,925 --> 00:09:06,245
This is not the time.

129
00:09:06,325 --> 00:09:07,126
We'll do it tomorrow.

130
00:09:07,406 --> 00:09:09,325
Tomorrow? Isn't he leaving tomorrow?

131
00:09:09,446 --> 00:09:10,485
He can't leave now.

132
00:09:10,726 --> 00:09:13,286
The two of them are
professing their love in the toilet.

133
00:09:14,925 --> 00:09:16,166
Dating in the toilet?

134
00:09:16,686 --> 00:09:17,446
That's right.

135
00:09:17,566 --> 00:09:18,886
-No.
-What's wrong?

136
00:09:19,286 --> 00:09:20,726
You're easily impressed.

137
00:09:23,726 --> 00:09:25,846
I really don't understand
about today's young people.

138
00:09:55,006 --> 00:09:56,805
Don't you like Meng Meng?

139
00:09:57,126 --> 00:10:00,126
You were dying for her before.

140
00:10:00,365 --> 00:10:01,166
Why did you...

141
00:10:01,966 --> 00:10:02,606
This...

142
00:10:03,365 --> 00:10:05,566
This... Me...

143
00:10:08,926 --> 00:10:10,246
She is just a patient.

144
00:10:10,926 --> 00:10:11,885
A younger sister to me.

145
00:10:13,606 --> 00:10:15,685
But it shouldn't be me.

146
00:10:19,246 --> 00:10:20,726
What do you like about me?

147
00:10:20,726 --> 00:10:23,085
What are you trying to get from me?

148
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:24,366
I eat a lot.

149
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,325
I love to fight.

150
00:10:26,685 --> 00:10:28,445
I don't have a father or mother.

151
00:10:28,606 --> 00:10:29,486
Then...

152
00:10:29,486 --> 00:10:30,726
I like everything about you.

153
00:10:33,046 --> 00:10:34,846
I like that you can cook for me

154
00:10:35,606 --> 00:10:37,046
and protect me.

155
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:39,046
And you don't have Mr. Right yet.

156
00:10:46,366 --> 00:10:48,445
You're out of your mind.

157
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:49,926
You are.

158
00:10:50,685 --> 00:10:52,406
Well, it's not that I'm out of my mind.

159
00:10:53,806 --> 00:10:55,525
Everything has come to light now.

160
00:10:58,685 --> 00:11:01,366
I've been holding this back
for a long time in my heart.

161
00:11:02,606 --> 00:11:03,685
I thought

162
00:11:04,366 --> 00:11:06,606
I would never be able
to say it in my life.

163
00:11:12,246 --> 00:11:14,125
Why did you still say it?

164
00:11:18,926 --> 00:11:21,685
That's because
when I didn't believe in myself,

165
00:11:22,685 --> 00:11:24,885
you were willing
to trust me with your life.

166
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:28,565
I have no choice
but to give my heart to you.

167
00:11:31,445 --> 00:11:32,406
Goethe said this before.

168
00:11:33,085 --> 00:11:35,486
"I love you, but
it has nothing to do with you."

169
00:11:35,846 --> 00:11:38,005
You can don't like me

170
00:11:38,486 --> 00:11:39,445
if that's how you feel.

171
00:11:40,486 --> 00:11:42,685
But don't tell me about it.

172
00:11:50,005 --> 00:11:50,885
The thing is,

173
00:11:53,885 --> 00:11:55,726
is it ethically appropriate?

174
00:11:56,565 --> 00:11:57,885
Based on our seniority,

175
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:00,606
I am your grandma.

176
00:12:01,085 --> 00:12:02,406
You are my grandson.

177
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:03,926
If we...

178
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:06,926
If I'm your girlfriend...

179
00:12:07,606 --> 00:12:08,325
It's appropriate.

180
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:10,366
Why is it inappropriate?

181
00:12:10,765 --> 00:12:12,286
There's a very practical issue.

182
00:12:13,765 --> 00:12:15,846
Your mom can't even accept Meng Meng.

183
00:12:17,005 --> 00:12:18,926
Would she accept me?

184
00:12:20,445 --> 00:12:22,286
I'm the one dating, not her.

185
00:12:22,286 --> 00:12:23,166
Don't bother her.

186
00:12:27,606 --> 00:12:28,806
Well, can we

187
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,325
not tell her about this?

188
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:33,606
Can we not tell her?

189
00:12:33,765 --> 00:12:34,565
Cough,

190
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:35,726
poor,

191
00:12:35,926 --> 00:12:38,926
and love can't be hidden.

192
00:12:46,246 --> 00:12:50,366
Well, we're classmates
and fellow friends then.

193
00:12:53,046 --> 00:12:54,125
So, you're

194
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:55,486
rejecting me?

195
00:13:02,765 --> 00:13:06,005
I want to stand upright by your side.

196
00:13:07,445 --> 00:13:09,166
Just wait until I become the inheritor.

197
00:13:09,806 --> 00:13:12,246
You can also introduce me openly

198
00:13:13,366 --> 00:13:14,445
to your family

199
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:16,806
and friends.

200
00:13:19,366 --> 00:13:20,286
By that time,

201
00:13:23,606 --> 00:13:25,005
it would be better.

202
00:13:28,046 --> 00:13:28,525
Okay.

203
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:30,885
I promise you.

204
00:13:55,806 --> 00:13:56,565
It's so late now.

205
00:13:56,685 --> 00:13:58,366
Tou Tou didn't even call us.

206
00:13:58,486 --> 00:14:00,286
We couldn't contact both of them.

207
00:14:00,926 --> 00:14:02,926
That means they're together.

208
00:14:06,246 --> 00:14:07,885
Tou Tou isn't afraid of anything.

209
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:09,606
If Tian Zhen is with her,

210
00:14:09,806 --> 00:14:10,846
there shouldn't be a problem.

211
00:14:12,486 --> 00:14:14,565
No news is good news.

212
00:14:31,486 --> 00:14:32,445
What's the matter, Tou Tou?

213
00:14:34,366 --> 00:14:35,325
Does it still hurt?

214
00:14:36,246 --> 00:14:37,926
How does it feel compared to just now?

215
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,406
It hurts more than before.

216
00:14:43,806 --> 00:14:44,325
This...

217
00:14:44,806 --> 00:14:46,645
Let's go to the ER. It's very dangerous.

218
00:14:46,846 --> 00:14:47,926
No need for that.

219
00:14:48,325 --> 00:14:49,286
I know how things stand.

220
00:14:54,046 --> 00:14:54,645
How about this?

221
00:14:54,885 --> 00:14:55,926
I'll call my dad.

222
00:14:56,046 --> 00:14:57,286
Lie down and wait for me.

223
00:15:17,286 --> 00:15:17,846
Who is it?

224
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:20,406
I don't know.

225
00:15:20,966 --> 00:15:22,125
Take the call.

226
00:15:29,286 --> 00:15:29,846
Hello.

227
00:15:31,286 --> 00:15:32,806
Hello, Dad. Please save Tou Tou.

228
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:36,286
Speak slowly. What happened to Tou Tou?

229
00:15:37,486 --> 00:15:38,606
She has sudden abdominal pain.

230
00:15:38,726 --> 00:15:40,046
Her tongue is in red, coated in yellow.

231
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,005
She has a string-like, rapid pulse.

232
00:15:42,205 --> 00:15:43,525
I think it may be appendicitis.

233
00:15:43,926 --> 00:15:45,525
(And, I'm afraid
it has festered and perforated.)

234
00:15:45,926 --> 00:15:46,645
Have you done acupuncture on her?

235
00:15:46,806 --> 00:15:47,926
Yes. And she had taken the medicine.

236
00:15:48,366 --> 00:15:49,366
What medicine did you prescribe?

237
00:15:50,685 --> 00:15:51,685
(Rhubarb, 30g.)

238
00:15:52,046 --> 00:15:52,885
Rhubarb, 30g.

239
00:15:53,046 --> 00:15:54,246
(Tree peony bark, 12g.)

240
00:15:54,606 --> 00:15:55,406
Tree peony bark, 12g.

241
00:15:55,406 --> 00:15:55,966
(Peach kernel.)

242
00:15:56,565 --> 00:15:57,166
(Ten grams.)

243
00:15:57,246 --> 00:15:58,046
Peach kernel, 10g.

244
00:15:58,445 --> 00:15:59,606
(Winter melon seeds, 20g.)

245
00:15:59,726 --> 00:16:00,565
Winter melon seeds, 20g.

246
00:16:01,046 --> 00:16:01,726
(Tian Zhen.)

247
00:16:02,445 --> 00:16:04,606
(Your rhubarb and
peony prescription is not bad. )

248
00:16:04,726 --> 00:16:06,366
But you used a lot of rhubarb.

249
00:16:06,685 --> 00:16:07,366
Why is that?

250
00:16:07,606 --> 00:16:08,486
She is an the emergency!

251
00:16:08,486 --> 00:16:10,005
I think it's necessary to use
a stronger dose for emergency cases.

252
00:16:10,046 --> 00:16:10,486
That's why I...

253
00:16:10,486 --> 00:16:11,966
This is not medical science.

254
00:16:12,445 --> 00:16:13,791
The most important thing
in TCM treatment

255
00:16:13,816 --> 00:16:14,606
is based on syndrome differentiation!

256
00:16:14,685 --> 00:16:17,005
How could you add or reduce the dose
without differentiating the syndrome?

257
00:16:17,246 --> 00:16:19,565
(Take her to the ER now.
The sooner the better)

258
00:16:19,685 --> 00:16:20,806
Okay, I'll do it right away.

259
00:16:21,685 --> 00:16:23,246
Tou Tou, what are you doing?

260
00:16:23,806 --> 00:16:24,486
Tian Zhen...

261
00:16:32,726 --> 00:16:33,926
I'm not going to the hospital.

262
00:16:34,005 --> 00:16:35,885
I've told you, I know where it stands.

263
00:16:35,926 --> 00:16:37,246
You don't even listen to my dad now?

264
00:16:37,286 --> 00:16:37,926
Let's go now.

265
00:16:38,046 --> 00:16:38,806
I don't know where it stands now.

266
00:16:38,806 --> 00:16:40,726
I've told you, I'm not going!

267
00:16:40,806 --> 00:16:42,005
What am I going to do with my life

268
00:16:42,005 --> 00:16:43,125
if something happens to you? Let's go!

269
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:44,125
I really don't want to go!

270
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:45,885
Just believe in yourself, Ren Tian Zhen!

271
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:47,565
If you're going to do this again,
just go outside!

272
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:48,486
Just wait outside!

273
00:16:58,445 --> 00:16:59,246
What happened to Tian Zhen?

274
00:16:59,246 --> 00:17:00,125
Where are they?

275
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:01,486
What's wrong with Tou Tou?

276
00:17:08,406 --> 00:17:09,246
Your son is fine.

277
00:17:09,765 --> 00:17:10,166
I...

278
00:17:14,286 --> 00:17:15,645
What about Tou Tou?

279
00:17:39,286 --> 00:17:40,926
Is Tian Zhen back?

280
00:17:41,366 --> 00:17:42,125
Mrs. Song.

281
00:17:42,885 --> 00:17:43,806
I'm looking for my master.

282
00:17:51,046 --> 00:17:51,966
He's looking for you.

283
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:56,926
Acute abdomen?

284
00:17:57,926 --> 00:17:58,406
Yes.

285
00:17:59,765 --> 00:18:00,645
Has it festered?

286
00:18:02,486 --> 00:18:03,286
I have no idea.

287
00:18:05,005 --> 00:18:07,166
Why use such a strong dose then?

288
00:18:08,525 --> 00:18:09,525
Who prescribed this?

289
00:18:11,005 --> 00:18:11,645
Tian Zhen.

290
00:18:19,926 --> 00:18:20,885
Who is the patient?

291
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:23,046
Sun Tou Tou.

292
00:18:25,806 --> 00:18:26,726
Tou Tou?

293
00:18:28,486 --> 00:18:29,885
Then this prescription will work.

294
00:18:30,246 --> 00:18:31,765
"Overkill to right a wrong."

295
00:18:33,525 --> 00:18:35,125
For Tou Tou, this prescription

296
00:18:36,046 --> 00:18:36,685
is just nice.

297
00:18:37,645 --> 00:18:38,486
Go and sleep without worries.

298
00:18:41,526 --> 00:18:42,285
Thank you, Master.

299
00:19:05,685 --> 00:19:06,405
Tian Zhen.

300
00:19:07,606 --> 00:19:08,366
Let's go.

301
00:19:08,846 --> 00:19:09,925
Let's go to the hospital now.

302
00:19:09,925 --> 00:19:11,325
Bring that medicine over.

303
00:19:11,646 --> 00:19:12,805
Do you still want to drink it?

304
00:19:14,246 --> 00:19:15,405
Just bring it over.

305
00:19:15,606 --> 00:19:16,246
No!

306
00:19:23,366 --> 00:19:25,285
I think before we start dating,

307
00:19:25,486 --> 00:19:27,006
we should set some rules.

308
00:19:27,526 --> 00:19:29,766
If we don't set the rules,
we can't be good.

309
00:19:30,526 --> 00:19:31,766
What rules?

310
00:19:31,966 --> 00:19:33,246
For major matters, listen to me.

311
00:19:33,646 --> 00:19:34,925
For minor matters, listen to you.

312
00:19:35,606 --> 00:19:37,405
What is considered
a major or minor matter then?

313
00:19:37,405 --> 00:19:39,646
I'll make the call
on the standards of it.

314
00:19:41,445 --> 00:19:42,445
Like this situation now,

315
00:19:42,726 --> 00:19:44,565
a matter of life and death,

316
00:19:45,405 --> 00:19:46,925
it's a major matter, right?

317
00:19:47,526 --> 00:19:49,405
Listen to me, okay?

318
00:19:49,405 --> 00:19:50,126
Go get the medicine.

319
00:19:54,766 --> 00:19:55,246
No.

320
00:19:56,366 --> 00:19:58,486
What if you're dead
after taking the medicine?

321
00:19:58,925 --> 00:20:00,325
If I'm dead after taking the medicine,

322
00:20:00,886 --> 00:20:01,886
then congratulations.

323
00:20:02,646 --> 00:20:04,766
This is your shortest-term girlfriend.

324
00:20:11,325 --> 00:20:12,205
Go now.

325
00:20:15,565 --> 00:20:16,366
Please come in.

326
00:20:24,045 --> 00:20:25,165
I'm sorry.

327
00:20:25,646 --> 00:20:26,886
Sorry for troubling you.

328
00:20:28,006 --> 00:20:29,126
-You tell them.
-Okay.

329
00:20:30,685 --> 00:20:31,685
I think you should tell them.

330
00:20:32,285 --> 00:20:33,405
It's okay, just say it.

331
00:20:34,445 --> 00:20:35,085
Well, it's like this.

332
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:37,085
There is an Uncle Niu in the town.

333
00:20:37,646 --> 00:20:39,486
He has psoriasis.

334
00:20:39,486 --> 00:20:41,165
He has been treated for decades,
but he hasn't recovered.

335
00:20:41,246 --> 00:20:43,606
The thing is, he feels itchy
at night that he can't sleep at all.

336
00:20:43,646 --> 00:20:45,486
-Am I right?
-Yes.

337
00:20:45,606 --> 00:20:47,165
We've persuaded him

338
00:20:47,165 --> 00:20:48,366
and asked him not to come now.

339
00:20:48,526 --> 00:20:49,526
But he has come and will never leave.

340
00:20:49,526 --> 00:20:50,045
That's right.

341
00:20:50,045 --> 00:20:52,366
So, we have to
trouble you to go and check him.

342
00:20:52,606 --> 00:20:53,685
Please check him.

343
00:20:53,766 --> 00:20:54,766
Actually, it's like this.

344
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,285
Psoriasis is a chronic disease.

345
00:20:56,405 --> 00:20:58,006
It may take a while to treat him.

346
00:20:58,165 --> 00:21:00,246
But Tou Tou and I
won't stay here for long.

347
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:03,405
Well, it's not easy to treat psoriasis.

348
00:21:03,606 --> 00:21:05,285
But you can treat insomnia.

349
00:21:09,246 --> 00:21:11,126
Alright, I'll go with you.

350
00:21:11,165 --> 00:21:11,646
Okay.

351
00:21:11,685 --> 00:21:12,325
Auntie.

352
00:21:12,486 --> 00:21:14,886
Please get the medicine for Tou Tou.

353
00:21:17,045 --> 00:21:17,445
Okay.

354
00:21:17,565 --> 00:21:18,366
Alright.

355
00:23:09,486 --> 00:23:10,405
Sleep early.

356
00:23:11,526 --> 00:23:12,766
You can't sleep either, right?

357
00:23:14,045 --> 00:23:15,886
Are you worried about your son?

358
00:23:21,685 --> 00:23:23,405
Look. He treated a patient.

359
00:23:24,165 --> 00:23:25,246
But that has scared me.

360
00:23:25,285 --> 00:23:26,685
That almost took half of my life.

361
00:23:27,285 --> 00:23:29,126
I felt tenser

362
00:23:29,805 --> 00:23:31,325
than I treat patients on my own.

363
00:23:37,805 --> 00:23:38,886
Raising a son

364
00:23:39,886 --> 00:23:40,606
is no fun.

365
00:23:44,685 --> 00:23:45,366
That's right.

366
00:23:53,886 --> 00:23:55,805
You're heartless.

367
00:23:57,246 --> 00:23:58,886
How could you still sleep?

368
00:24:01,646 --> 00:24:03,405
How could you still sleep?

369
00:24:07,606 --> 00:24:10,165
He is considered good.

370
00:24:11,006 --> 00:24:11,925
He knew

371
00:24:12,165 --> 00:24:14,726
he should use
rhubarb and tree peony bark.

372
00:24:15,285 --> 00:24:16,846
It's just that
the doses were slightly higher.

373
00:24:17,045 --> 00:24:18,486
Can the tiny Tou Tou

374
00:24:18,805 --> 00:24:20,205
bear it?

375
00:24:20,526 --> 00:24:21,766
She can bear it.

376
00:24:23,646 --> 00:24:24,886
You are so confident.

377
00:24:26,886 --> 00:24:28,085
If she can't bear it,

378
00:24:29,165 --> 00:24:31,165
she can't be the inheritor.

379
00:24:31,805 --> 00:24:33,445
Tou Tou has a tough life.

380
00:24:33,925 --> 00:24:35,085
Since she was young,

381
00:24:35,565 --> 00:24:37,526
she has gone through many ups and downs.

382
00:24:37,526 --> 00:24:39,126
It's a lot more than Tian Zhen.

383
00:24:40,526 --> 00:24:42,886
"Heaven sent
a big responsibility to a man."

384
00:24:43,646 --> 00:24:45,565
This difficulty
from Tian Zhen doesn't matter.

385
00:24:45,886 --> 00:24:46,685
Think about this.

386
00:24:47,445 --> 00:24:51,565
Back then,
to test Emperor Shun, Emperor Yao

387
00:24:51,685 --> 00:24:54,126
put him in the forest

388
00:24:54,246 --> 00:24:55,766
to wrestle with the beasts.

389
00:24:56,045 --> 00:24:57,246
Compared to this,

390
00:24:57,685 --> 00:24:59,685
Tou Tou's tests are nothing.

391
00:25:01,886 --> 00:25:04,805
That's why
you think Tou Tou will be fine?

392
00:25:05,285 --> 00:25:07,486
What reasoning is that?

393
00:25:07,646 --> 00:25:09,526
And you're a TCM practitioner.

394
00:25:10,246 --> 00:25:11,486
Back then, to test Emperor Shun,

395
00:25:11,766 --> 00:25:13,685
Emperor Yao

396
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:15,886
even married off
his two daughters to him.

397
00:25:16,285 --> 00:25:18,325
Why didn't you
mention the sweet part as well?

398
00:25:19,886 --> 00:25:22,405
Well, I don't have two daughters.

399
00:25:22,405 --> 00:25:23,925
I only have a grandson.

400
00:25:27,405 --> 00:25:28,205
You,

401
00:25:28,805 --> 00:25:29,565
me

402
00:25:29,685 --> 00:25:30,646
and

403
00:25:31,246 --> 00:25:32,685
Ling Lan, and Xin Zheng.

404
00:25:33,285 --> 00:25:35,685
We practice medicine all
our lives and abide by medical ethics.

405
00:25:35,685 --> 00:25:36,766
Just this fact alone,

406
00:25:37,006 --> 00:25:38,486
our descendants will be good.

407
00:25:41,325 --> 00:25:42,006
Don't worry.

408
00:25:43,405 --> 00:25:43,886
Go to sleep.

409
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:46,886
I can't sleep.

410
00:27:07,766 --> 00:27:08,606
Good morning, Auntie.

411
00:27:08,646 --> 00:27:09,246
Good morning.

412
00:27:11,886 --> 00:27:13,165
How is she?

413
00:27:13,526 --> 00:27:16,405
I saw her go to
the toilet many times last night.

414
00:27:16,526 --> 00:27:17,565
How is she now?

415
00:27:17,685 --> 00:27:19,646
Auntie, she was fine after that.

416
00:27:19,646 --> 00:27:20,766
I think she should be fine.

417
00:27:22,325 --> 00:27:24,606
If one survives a catastrophe, she
is bound to have great fortune later on.

418
00:27:25,366 --> 00:27:27,006
With a boyfriend like you,

419
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:29,565
no matter what happens,
God will avoid her.

420
00:27:30,526 --> 00:27:31,925
Don't be shy.

421
00:27:32,445 --> 00:27:34,165
I've been there.

422
00:27:34,405 --> 00:27:36,726
The look in your eyes
when you carried her here,

423
00:27:36,925 --> 00:27:38,886
I understood everything when I saw it.

424
00:27:39,285 --> 00:27:40,526
Auntie, is it so obvious?

425
00:27:41,165 --> 00:27:43,006
Do you need my help?

426
00:27:43,006 --> 00:27:43,925
No, no.

427
00:27:44,045 --> 00:27:45,126
I don't need your help here.

428
00:27:45,285 --> 00:27:46,766
You'll be busy later.

429
00:27:47,886 --> 00:27:48,766
Later?

430
00:27:49,006 --> 00:27:50,085
What am I busy with?

431
00:27:53,766 --> 00:27:56,606
Well, she still needs
to take medicine for a few days.

432
00:27:56,606 --> 00:27:58,685
You definitely won't be able
to leave for the time being.

433
00:27:58,805 --> 00:27:59,715
Look.

434
00:27:59,741 --> 00:28:03,800
Can you please treat
all the sick people in this town?

435
00:28:05,006 --> 00:28:07,526
Auntie, I'm worried that
my medical skills are not good enough.

436
00:28:07,526 --> 00:28:08,685
No problem.

437
00:28:08,766 --> 00:28:09,646
You're good.

438
00:28:09,925 --> 00:28:11,126
I went to buy groceries just now.

439
00:28:11,246 --> 00:28:13,366
When I passed by Uncle Niu's house,

440
00:28:14,045 --> 00:28:16,646
I heard his loud snoring sound.

441
00:28:16,646 --> 00:28:19,246
I think all his neighbors could hear.

442
00:28:19,685 --> 00:28:20,486
As long as it's effective.

443
00:28:20,685 --> 00:28:23,085
Auntie, I'm alone
and I'm inexperienced.

444
00:28:23,085 --> 00:28:23,766
You can.

445
00:28:26,486 --> 00:28:27,285
You can.

446
00:28:28,325 --> 00:28:29,126
Auntie.

447
00:28:29,526 --> 00:28:30,405
He can do it.

448
00:28:30,646 --> 00:28:31,165
Yes.

449
00:28:32,966 --> 00:28:34,165
Auntie, let me tell you.

450
00:28:34,205 --> 00:28:36,419
He is a great doctor.

451
00:28:36,445 --> 00:28:38,685
It's a great bargain that you found him.

452
00:28:39,006 --> 00:28:39,685
That's right.

453
00:28:40,366 --> 00:28:41,646
This is great.

454
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:44,646
We finally got a doctor to help us

455
00:28:45,006 --> 00:28:47,085
with the consultation
from the first-tier city.

456
00:28:47,526 --> 00:28:50,325
Our pharmacy will be famous too.

457
00:28:50,486 --> 00:28:51,405
It's like it's consecrated.

458
00:28:51,925 --> 00:28:52,966
You're too kind.

459
00:28:53,205 --> 00:28:53,766
Doctor.

460
00:28:55,246 --> 00:28:56,846
How much is your consultation fee?

461
00:28:58,805 --> 00:28:59,366
It's a free consultation.

462
00:29:00,126 --> 00:29:00,805
No money is required.

463
00:29:00,886 --> 00:29:02,285
-A free consultation?
-That's right.

464
00:29:02,486 --> 00:29:03,285
A free consultation?

465
00:29:04,045 --> 00:29:04,886
That's great.

466
00:29:05,165 --> 00:29:07,165
I'll tell Old He about this.

467
00:29:07,445 --> 00:29:07,886
Slow down!

468
00:29:07,886 --> 00:29:08,606
Slow down!

469
00:29:11,405 --> 00:29:11,886
Tou Tou.

470
00:29:12,766 --> 00:29:13,285
A free consultation?

471
00:29:15,445 --> 00:29:15,966
A free consultation.

472
00:29:17,405 --> 00:29:18,085
We'll do it together then.

473
00:29:24,646 --> 00:29:25,285
Take this.

474
00:29:26,405 --> 00:29:27,526
Listen to me.

475
00:29:27,526 --> 00:29:29,886
It's not easy
to invite the great doctor here.

476
00:29:30,045 --> 00:29:31,006
He hasn't had breakfast yet.

477
00:29:31,006 --> 00:29:33,805
He'll treat everyone
after breakfast, okay?

478
00:29:33,886 --> 00:29:35,766
We'll do this according to the number.

479
00:29:36,045 --> 00:29:37,366
Everyone will get a number.

480
00:29:37,405 --> 00:29:39,045
We'll call the number
and see the doctor, okay?

481
00:29:39,366 --> 00:29:40,165
Come and get the number.

482
00:29:40,366 --> 00:29:41,285
Uncle He!

483
00:29:41,486 --> 00:29:42,366
Tao Zi, come here.

484
00:29:42,366 --> 00:29:43,405
Come here, quick!

485
00:29:44,285 --> 00:29:45,526
Come here. I'll give you a number.

486
00:29:45,766 --> 00:29:47,685
Go and bring your grandma over.

487
00:29:47,805 --> 00:29:50,445
She'll see a doctor to treat
her rheumatism with this number.

488
00:29:51,006 --> 00:29:52,685
How much does it cost to see a doctor?

489
00:29:53,526 --> 00:29:54,685
No money is needed.

490
00:29:54,685 --> 00:29:55,925
This is a free consultation.

491
00:29:57,126 --> 00:29:59,045
My grandma isn't willing
to spend money on medical treatment.

492
00:29:59,045 --> 00:29:59,966
I'll bear it.

493
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:01,246
Come on, let me tell you. Look.

494
00:30:02,285 --> 00:30:04,285
The doctor brought it from the city.

495
00:30:04,526 --> 00:30:06,246
It's a black sesame ball. Try it.

496
00:30:06,285 --> 00:30:07,646
It's delicious and healthy.

497
00:30:10,045 --> 00:30:10,846
It smells good.

498
00:30:11,766 --> 00:30:12,805
It's molten sesame filling!

499
00:30:13,006 --> 00:30:14,405
Uncle He, you must keep your word.

500
00:30:14,405 --> 00:30:15,285
I'm going to ask
my grandma to come over.

501
00:30:15,285 --> 00:30:16,246
Go now.

502
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:17,246
Go.

503
00:30:19,405 --> 00:30:20,606
-Aunt Zhang, here you go.
-Hello.

504
00:30:20,606 --> 00:30:22,445
-Distribute this to everyone.
-Okay.

505
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:23,766
Come and get this.

506
00:30:24,006 --> 00:30:24,685
Hold it.

507
00:30:26,646 --> 00:30:27,685
Line up.

508
00:30:30,085 --> 00:30:31,766
This is very good for the body.

509
00:30:32,285 --> 00:30:33,766
After the doctor checks you,

510
00:30:33,766 --> 00:30:35,006
only us...

511
00:30:35,165 --> 00:30:36,126
Whoever needs or wants it,

512
00:30:36,165 --> 00:30:38,006
you can buy some
and eat it for your health.

513
00:30:38,006 --> 00:30:39,646
This is just like a general hospital.

514
00:30:39,646 --> 00:30:40,646
There are so many of them.

515
00:30:42,405 --> 00:30:43,846
Girl, doctor.

516
00:30:44,126 --> 00:30:45,405
Come and eat.

517
00:30:46,366 --> 00:30:47,886
You should eat more today.

518
00:30:50,486 --> 00:30:51,285
Whoever needs or wants it,

519
00:30:51,285 --> 00:30:53,366
you can buy some
and eat it for your health.

520
00:30:53,405 --> 00:30:54,045
Am I right?

521
00:30:55,526 --> 00:30:56,126
Let's go and eat.

522
00:32:21,526 --> 00:32:24,246
Tell me. Why Tian Zhen and Tou Tou

523
00:32:24,405 --> 00:32:26,205
aren't home yet?

524
00:32:27,886 --> 00:32:29,766
The two of them
are doing good deeds now.

525
00:32:31,486 --> 00:32:32,486
What good deed?

526
00:32:33,366 --> 00:32:34,886
Tou Tou called me just now.

527
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:36,766
She said she hasn't fully recovered yet.

528
00:32:37,285 --> 00:32:39,526
She still needs to rest for a few days.

529
00:32:39,685 --> 00:32:40,486
It just so happens that

530
00:32:41,246 --> 00:32:42,646
Tian Zhen
will provide a free consultation.

531
00:32:44,246 --> 00:32:46,445
They said that in the village,

532
00:32:46,606 --> 00:32:48,285
the queue line is very long.

533
00:32:48,886 --> 00:32:50,366
There are all kinds of diseases.

534
00:32:50,685 --> 00:32:51,846
Right now, when your son

535
00:32:52,526 --> 00:32:53,685
goes to the washroom,

536
00:32:54,366 --> 00:32:55,886
he needs to finish it in seconds.

537
00:32:57,766 --> 00:32:59,486
Don't underestimate
people at the countryside.

538
00:32:59,766 --> 00:33:02,165
They have many kinds of diseases
and a history of that.

539
00:33:02,285 --> 00:33:03,366
It's not easy to treat them.

540
00:33:04,606 --> 00:33:05,405
Don't worry.

541
00:33:06,006 --> 00:33:07,526
If he encounters any problems,

542
00:33:07,526 --> 00:33:08,646
he will call and ask us.

543
00:33:12,246 --> 00:33:12,925
How about

544
00:33:13,646 --> 00:33:14,646
we go there too?

545
00:33:15,126 --> 00:33:15,766
We might as well

546
00:33:16,366 --> 00:33:18,006
provide free consultation
on a big scale.

547
00:33:19,405 --> 00:33:20,886
Just believe in your son.

548
00:33:22,486 --> 00:33:24,165
He is launching his career now.

549
00:33:24,646 --> 00:33:25,486
We must trust him.

550
00:33:30,405 --> 00:33:31,405
Did you

551
00:33:31,886 --> 00:33:33,766
eat anything delicious today?

552
00:33:35,766 --> 00:33:37,805
You've never trusted him.

553
00:33:47,165 --> 00:33:48,325
We should ask Tian Zhen

554
00:33:48,325 --> 00:33:49,486
to write down all prescriptions

555
00:33:49,486 --> 00:33:51,486
and send them all back
for us to have a look.

556
00:33:54,606 --> 00:33:56,246
When you first checked a patient,

557
00:33:56,246 --> 00:33:57,606
was your dad with you?

558
00:33:58,925 --> 00:33:59,805
No.

559
00:33:59,886 --> 00:34:01,405
Well, this is what your dad said.

560
00:34:02,925 --> 00:34:04,646
"Distrust of children

561
00:34:04,646 --> 00:34:06,685
is a curse on children."

562
00:34:07,805 --> 00:34:08,966
Trust that our son

563
00:34:09,405 --> 00:34:11,285
will surpass us in the future.

564
00:34:19,366 --> 00:34:20,405
You two are chit-chatting.

565
00:34:21,045 --> 00:34:21,846
Shan Dao.

566
00:34:22,405 --> 00:34:24,205
Your lecture is in Room 203.

567
00:34:24,205 --> 00:34:25,205
Let me take you there.

568
00:34:25,205 --> 00:34:26,766
I know. Don't rush about it.

569
00:34:26,766 --> 00:34:28,205
I just came over to say hello

570
00:34:28,445 --> 00:34:30,805
and give him a card.

571
00:34:31,766 --> 00:34:32,646
What card?

572
00:34:34,165 --> 00:34:35,526
From the alumni association.

573
00:34:37,966 --> 00:34:39,366
Don't we have a gathering every year?

574
00:34:41,445 --> 00:34:42,726
This is strange.

575
00:34:43,006 --> 00:34:46,126
He has never praised his son
but he just did it.

576
00:34:46,646 --> 00:34:48,606
He has never joined the reunion class

577
00:34:48,606 --> 00:34:49,925
but he's going now.

578
00:34:50,205 --> 00:34:51,886
And pigs might fly.

579
00:35:00,126 --> 00:35:00,886
Is there anything?

580
00:35:01,445 --> 00:35:02,925
Nothing, nothing.

581
00:35:03,766 --> 00:35:05,126
Continue with your talk.

582
00:35:05,246 --> 00:35:06,006
I'm going to the class now.

583
00:35:06,165 --> 00:35:06,726
I'm going now.

584
00:35:17,486 --> 00:35:19,486
The class reunion...
Almost thirty years.

585
00:35:21,445 --> 00:35:22,486
Little Lark is going too.

586
00:35:29,766 --> 00:35:31,285
I'm attending Shan Dao's class.

587
00:35:52,486 --> 00:35:53,086
Ms. Song.

588
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:55,006
Mr. Ren asked me to invite you

589
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:56,766
to Prof. Wu's class.

590
00:35:59,125 --> 00:36:00,645
I'm ordering lunch.

591
00:36:00,726 --> 00:36:02,486
Yesterday, didn't you ask me to order

592
00:36:02,486 --> 00:36:03,486
a stomach-nourishing soup for Mr. Ren?

593
00:36:03,885 --> 00:36:04,966
What soup nourishes the stomach?

594
00:36:16,405 --> 00:36:18,486
There are papaya chicken soup

595
00:36:18,486 --> 00:36:20,365
and keel...

596
00:36:20,405 --> 00:36:21,246
Ms. Song.

597
00:36:25,046 --> 00:36:25,966
What's with her?

598
00:36:27,526 --> 00:36:28,326
I don't know.

599
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:30,405
Did Prof. Ren make her angry?

600
00:36:31,966 --> 00:36:33,726
Should I order
this stomach-nourishing soup?

601
00:36:34,605 --> 00:36:35,685
Of course, order it.

602
00:36:35,806 --> 00:36:37,006
She ignored me.

603
00:36:37,205 --> 00:36:38,165
It's alright.

604
00:36:38,445 --> 00:36:40,086
She will forget after a while.

605
00:36:40,125 --> 00:36:42,165
I've never seen anyone
who loves her husband more than her.

606
00:36:44,486 --> 00:36:45,365
What else?

607
00:36:47,006 --> 00:36:48,246
Who ordered sesame paste?

608
00:36:48,246 --> 00:36:49,246
Order one for me too.

609
00:36:49,605 --> 00:36:50,806
I ordered it for you.

610
00:36:51,046 --> 00:36:52,566
Didn't you say you like it?

611
00:36:52,605 --> 00:36:54,486
I saw it, so I ordered it for you.

612
00:36:56,726 --> 00:36:57,605
Thank you.

613
00:37:01,125 --> 00:37:02,766
There's no class
tomorrow afternoon, right?

614
00:37:05,486 --> 00:37:06,726
How about coming to my house?

615
00:37:07,806 --> 00:37:10,685
The model you made with Le Le
hasn't been completed, right?

616
00:37:11,605 --> 00:37:12,766
He keeps asking me

617
00:37:13,205 --> 00:37:15,046
when will that uncle
who doesn't talk come.

618
00:37:18,885 --> 00:37:19,845
So, we've decided.

619
00:37:20,205 --> 00:37:21,326
Have dinner at our house.

620
00:37:26,246 --> 00:37:27,125
I should talk more.

621
00:37:40,246 --> 00:37:40,885
You're home.

622
00:37:41,645 --> 00:37:42,445
Gosh, it's so sumptuous.

623
00:37:43,165 --> 00:37:43,966
Do you have good news?

624
00:37:44,966 --> 00:37:46,806
Yes, there is something to celebrate.

625
00:37:47,046 --> 00:37:47,645
Really?

626
00:37:48,885 --> 00:37:49,445
What a coincidence.

627
00:37:50,165 --> 00:37:51,806
I have good news to share with you too.

628
00:37:52,486 --> 00:37:53,246
Really?

629
00:37:53,845 --> 00:37:54,885
It's double happiness then!

630
00:37:54,885 --> 00:37:55,766
Go wash your hands and eat.

631
00:38:13,205 --> 00:38:13,726
Cut.

632
00:38:14,685 --> 00:38:16,806
Cut, cut.

633
00:38:17,445 --> 00:38:17,925
Cut.

634
00:38:18,526 --> 00:38:19,405
What are you doing?

635
00:38:20,925 --> 00:38:22,445
Got into a fight with Xin Zheng again?

636
00:38:24,125 --> 00:38:25,445
Who is Xin Zheng? I don't know him.

637
00:38:26,645 --> 00:38:28,726
Don't get mad at my flowers.

638
00:38:28,885 --> 00:38:29,286
You...

639
00:38:30,365 --> 00:38:31,365
It's mine.

640
00:38:31,486 --> 00:38:32,365
It's all mine!

641
00:38:35,806 --> 00:38:36,726
Let me tell you.

642
00:38:37,046 --> 00:38:39,086
Sulking will block the mammary gland.

643
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:51,205
Mom.

644
00:38:51,526 --> 00:38:54,405
Tell me. Are men

645
00:38:54,766 --> 00:38:56,566
children who will never grow?

646
00:38:56,726 --> 00:38:58,486
You put your heart and soul into them,

647
00:38:58,685 --> 00:38:59,966
but they would never appreciate it.

648
00:38:59,966 --> 00:39:01,125
Stop it, stop it.

649
00:39:01,125 --> 00:39:02,205
You make me dizzy.

650
00:39:02,445 --> 00:39:04,566
Are you talking about
the old or young one?

651
00:39:06,125 --> 00:39:07,685
Both are the same.

652
00:39:08,205 --> 00:39:09,445
Let's talk about the young one.

653
00:39:10,405 --> 00:39:11,885
He's like doesn't have a family.

654
00:39:12,165 --> 00:39:13,526
He's not like Tou Tou

655
00:39:13,526 --> 00:39:15,685
who would call
and tell us that she was fine.

656
00:39:16,006 --> 00:39:16,885
Look at him.

657
00:39:17,086 --> 00:39:17,885
It's been days

658
00:39:18,246 --> 00:39:19,726
but he didn't call us at all.

659
00:39:20,726 --> 00:39:21,246
That old...

660
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:24,046
Let's not talk about the old one.

661
00:39:24,645 --> 00:39:24,925
I...

662
00:39:26,006 --> 00:39:26,885
I don't even want to talk about it.

663
00:39:28,365 --> 00:39:30,246
Well, you're like a young girl.

664
00:39:30,645 --> 00:39:32,445
It's okay to say that to me.

665
00:39:32,486 --> 00:39:33,806
If you tell your dad that,

666
00:39:33,966 --> 00:39:35,486
he'll say that you...

667
00:39:35,685 --> 00:39:37,806
Have improper thoughts.

668
00:39:46,605 --> 00:39:47,553
Well,

669
00:39:47,578 --> 00:39:50,445
whether it's the husband or the son,

670
00:39:51,205 --> 00:39:54,205
including this house and plants,

671
00:39:54,885 --> 00:39:57,405
in the end, it won't be yours alone.

672
00:39:57,925 --> 00:39:59,046
Since this is the case,

673
00:39:59,286 --> 00:40:02,326
why must you make them
live according to your wishes?

674
00:40:08,486 --> 00:40:09,006
Mom.

675
00:40:11,205 --> 00:40:14,246
How did you spend
your lifetime with Dad?

676
00:40:16,486 --> 00:40:18,645
I've spent half my life with Xin Zheng.

677
00:40:19,445 --> 00:40:20,445
But I feel that

678
00:40:20,445 --> 00:40:22,766
I still can't understand his mind.

679
00:40:23,645 --> 00:40:25,605
A lifetime is so long.

680
00:40:26,405 --> 00:40:28,326
Why do you want to understand his mind?

681
00:40:28,966 --> 00:40:30,365
He is by your side.

682
00:40:30,925 --> 00:40:32,205
That's the best thing.

683
00:40:32,966 --> 00:40:33,766
Let me tell you.

684
00:40:33,766 --> 00:40:34,526
A marriage

685
00:40:34,685 --> 00:40:36,726
is actually paddling
a tandem paddle board.

686
00:40:36,966 --> 00:40:38,165
You must find someone

687
00:40:38,205 --> 00:40:40,445
who rows in the same direction as you,

688
00:40:40,726 --> 00:40:42,526
not someone holding you back.

689
00:40:43,445 --> 00:40:44,806
I think Xin Zheng is very good.

690
00:40:45,046 --> 00:40:46,526
You two have common topics to talk about

691
00:40:47,165 --> 00:40:49,486
and have careers together, right?

692
00:40:50,645 --> 00:40:52,526
You two are a couple for life.

693
00:40:55,205 --> 00:40:56,885
But why do I feel like

694
00:40:57,726 --> 00:40:59,766
I'm on the paddle board by myself

695
00:41:00,046 --> 00:41:01,766
while he is on the shore.

696
00:41:02,006 --> 00:41:03,326
He didn't board at all.

697
00:41:05,726 --> 00:41:07,205
Well, who was it then

698
00:41:07,205 --> 00:41:09,486
that cried so hard
and said wanted to marry him?

699
00:41:14,165 --> 00:41:15,205
It was me.

700
00:41:17,486 --> 00:41:19,605
Well, I think

701
00:41:21,445 --> 00:41:23,046
what really touched me was

702
00:41:23,046 --> 00:41:25,726
his belief in
traditional Chinese medicine.

703
00:41:26,445 --> 00:41:27,726
You know what?

704
00:41:27,726 --> 00:41:29,726
At that time, I firmly believed that

705
00:41:30,006 --> 00:41:32,566
he needs a good wife like me.

706
00:41:32,605 --> 00:41:33,966
That's it.

707
00:41:34,486 --> 00:41:35,845
Let's not say something great.

708
00:41:36,246 --> 00:41:38,326
Don't you like him at all?

709
00:41:39,885 --> 00:41:42,046
Back then, so many people liked you.

710
00:41:42,365 --> 00:41:43,806
Even Wu Shan Dao

711
00:41:44,645 --> 00:41:46,726
brought you to smell the flowers

712
00:41:46,925 --> 00:41:49,046
and see the spring cherry.

713
00:41:49,205 --> 00:41:50,885
He was busy all around

714
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:52,645
for one whole year but it was fruitless,

715
00:41:52,645 --> 00:41:55,205
because you don't love him, am I right?

716
00:41:55,766 --> 00:41:56,365
That's right.

717
00:41:57,365 --> 00:41:58,526
Xin Zheng is firm and unwavering.

718
00:41:59,046 --> 00:42:00,326
He's not like Wu Shan Dao

719
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:02,205
who was cunning.

720
00:42:03,125 --> 00:42:03,925
Well, I think

721
00:42:03,925 --> 00:42:06,726
it was Xin Zheng
who didn't take a closer look at you.

722
00:42:06,766 --> 00:42:07,845
When he reached our house,

723
00:42:07,966 --> 00:42:09,885
he went straight to his master's study.

724
00:42:10,526 --> 00:42:11,885
I wonder who was it that

725
00:42:12,165 --> 00:42:14,414
sent an apple

726
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,800
and then a cup of tea to the study.

727
00:42:17,046 --> 00:42:18,205
I didn't.

728
00:42:18,365 --> 00:42:18,966
I...

729
00:42:19,605 --> 00:42:21,806
I was being a good daughter to my dad.

730
00:42:22,246 --> 00:42:23,925
So, after he has become my son-in-law,

731
00:42:23,966 --> 00:42:25,685
you've stopped being
a good daughter to your dad?

732
00:42:27,966 --> 00:42:29,566
Why are you so annoying?

733
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,488
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

734
00:42:33,514 --> 00:42:34,858
(are referenced from relevant
traditional Chinese medicine books)

735
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,246
