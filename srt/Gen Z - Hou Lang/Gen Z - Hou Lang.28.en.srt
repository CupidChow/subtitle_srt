1
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,360
I'm not confident
in treating acute abdomen.

2
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,560
It'll be troublesome
if it festers and perforates.

3
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:15,920
I'll take you to the hospital.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,360
Three hours.

5
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,960
Night traveling
and perforation are both risky.

6
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,160
Tian Zhen.

7
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:34,840
You prescribe medicine.

8
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,040
I'll eat.

9
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,120
Boss, do you have a needle?

10
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,320
I'll get acupuncture treatment first.

11
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,680
I have.

12
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,120
Do you know how to do it?

13
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,240
I know.

14
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:54,960
Prescribe the medicine.

15
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,400
This...

16
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,640
He is a TCM practitioner.

17
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,360
A very good one.

18
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,600
You can trust him.

19
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,200
He's so young. He doesn't look like one.

20
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,520
It has been running in
his family for 14 generations.

21
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,960
His father is Ren Xin Zheng.

22
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,760
He is studying for a Ph.D. at University
of Traditional Chinese Medicine.

23
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,120
This...

24
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,520
You're Ren Xin Zheng's son?

25
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:28,960
Yes.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,357
Your dad's book is very famous.

27
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,680
What's its name?

28
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,357
"Understanding of TCM", right?

29
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,240
Yes.

30
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,960
We have one at home.

31
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,240
Later, please sign the book for me.

32
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,757
-Okay.
-Old He.

33
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,237
Hurry up! Grab the medicine and cook it!

34
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,360
-Okay, okay.
-He's really great!

35
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,320
Girl. Go knock on Uncle Niu's door.

36
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,957
Tell him that
his illness can be treated.

37
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,357
We have a great doctor here!

38
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,677
Alright, I'll go now.

39
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,560
Tou Tou.

40
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,040
I've never given
this prescription to anyone before.

41
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,800
Its dose is too strong.

42
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,160
Let's go to the hospital.

43
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,400
I'm not going to the hospital.

44
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:10,960
I trust you.

45
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,120
Tou Tou.

46
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,640
Do you feel better
after getting acupuncture?

47
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,760
I feel like
you can make it to the hospital.

48
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,226
I'll go and drive the car over.

49
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,960
Don't drink this medicine.

50
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,200
What happened?

51
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,520
It's bitter.

52
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,680
The after-taste is strong.

53
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,720
Let me tell you.

54
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,240
If you become
a great doctor in the future,

55
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,280
don't you forget about me.

56
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,560
I'm the first one
who tried your medicine.

57
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,680
I tried it with my life.

58
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,080
Understand?

59
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,760
This is very important.

60
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,640
Sun Tou Tou.

61
00:03:55,006 --> 00:03:56,077
Tou Tou, what's wrong with you?

62
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:56,960
Tou Tou!

63
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,237
Tou Tou, don't scare me!

64
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,317
Tou Tou, wake up.

65
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,280
Tou Tou!
Tou Tou!

66
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,840
Tou Tou, don't scare me!

67
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,597
Tou Tou, what's the situation now?

68
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,760
Why are you messing around?

69
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,800
I didn't.

70
00:04:12,881 --> 00:04:14,957
I just think that
the atmosphere is tense.

71
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,477
I just want it to be exciting.

72
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,720
I do not like this.

73
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,360
How do you feel now?

74
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,280
Panic.

75
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,440
Why are you panicking?

76
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,520
I...

77
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,040
I'm afraid I'd die
before inheriting the sect.

78
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,240
No, no.

79
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,237
Let's go to the hospital now, okay?

80
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,400
No, listen to me.

81
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,037
If I die...

82
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,440
I say, if...

83
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,280
You must take over as the inheritor.

84
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,440
And bury me next to my great-grandma.

85
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,720
Then, carved this on the tomb.

86
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,440
"Sacrifice by testing medicine

87
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,680
for a great doctor."

88
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,480
Understand?

89
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,000
I won't.

90
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,720
I will bury you
in the graveyard at my house.

91
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,120
And carved this on the tomb.

92
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,640
"Ma'am, you should take your medicine."

93
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,960
No.

94
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,237
Why am I buried
in the graveyard in your house?

95
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,000
Is it appropriate?

96
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,640
Your life is mine.

97
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,120
Whether you are alive or dead,

98
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,240
you are mine.

99
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,680
What's wrong?

100
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,440
What's the matter, Tou Tou?

101
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,720
Stomach?

102
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,040
Don't close the door.

103
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:53,960
What's wrong?

104
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,480
I'm afraid you'll fall into the pit.

105
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,120
I'm a doctor
and I'm responsible for you.

106
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,760
In case you faint, I'll catch you.

107
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,360
Don't you think it stinks?

108
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,320
If it smells good,
that'd be a problem.

109
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,240
I'll leave a gap then.

110
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,800
Okay.

111
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,000
Have you

112
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,520
figured it out?

113
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,840
This...

114
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,160
About what?

115
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,520
Be mine.

116
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,640
What do you mean?

117
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,560
No one has ever
profess his love to you before?

118
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,080
Profess your love?

119
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,757
I really haven't seen

120
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:02,200
someone professes love
during defecating.

121
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,640
Well, think about it then.

122
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,280
Do you want Uncle Niu to come now

123
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,840
and let Mr. Ren have a look?

124
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,757
No, no.

125
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,157
This is not the time.

126
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,040
We'll do it tomorrow.

127
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,240
Tomorrow? Isn't he leaving tomorrow?

128
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,400
He can't leave now.

129
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,200
The two of them are
professing their love in the toilet.

130
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,080
Dating in the toilet?

131
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,397
That's right.

132
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,800
-No.
-What's wrong?

133
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,640
You're easily impressed.

134
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,760
I really don't understand
about today's young people.

135
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,720
Don't you like Meng Meng?

136
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,040
You were dying for her before.

137
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,080
Why did you...

138
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,680
This...

139
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,480
This... Me...

140
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,160
She is just a patient.

141
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,800
A younger sister to me.

142
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,600
But it shouldn't be me.

143
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,557
What do you like about me?

144
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,997
What are you trying to get from me?

145
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,280
I eat a lot.

146
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,240
I love to fight.

147
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,360
I don't have a father or mother.

148
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,317
Then...

149
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,640
I like everything about you.

150
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,760
I like that you can cook for me

151
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,960
and protect me.

152
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,960
And you don't have Mr. Right yet.

153
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,360
You're out of your mind.

154
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:14,840
You are.

155
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,320
Well, it's not that I'm out of my mind.

156
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,440
Everything has come to light now.

157
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,280
I've been holding this back
for a long time in my heart.

158
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,600
I thought

159
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,520
I would never be able
to say it in my life.

160
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,040
Why did you still say it?

161
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,600
That's because
when I didn't believe in myself,

162
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,800
you were willing
to trust me with your life.

163
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,480
I have no choice
but to give my heart to you.

164
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,320
Goethe said this before.

165
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,400
"I love you, but
it has nothing to do with you."

166
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,920
You can don't like me

167
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,360
if that's how you feel.

168
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,600
But don't tell me about it.

169
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,800
The thing is,

170
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,640
is it ethically appropriate?

171
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,800
Based on our seniority,

172
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,520
I am your grandma.

173
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,320
You are my grandson.

174
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,840
If we...

175
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,840
If I'm your girlfriend...

176
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,320
It's appropriate.

177
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,280
Why is it inappropriate?

178
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,200
There's a very practical issue.

179
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,760
Your mom can't even accept Meng Meng.

180
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,840
Would she accept me?

181
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,117
I'm the one dating, not her.

182
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,080
Don't bother her.

183
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,720
Well, can we

184
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,240
not tell her about this?

185
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,520
Can we not tell her?

186
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,480
Cough,

187
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,720
poor,

188
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,840
and love can't be hidden.

189
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:15,280
Well, we're classmates
and fellow friends then.

190
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,040
So, you're

191
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,400
rejecting me?

192
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,920
I want to stand upright by your side.

193
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,080
Just wait until I become the inheritor.

194
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,160
You can also introduce me openly

195
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,360
to your family

196
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:41,840
and friends.

197
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,200
By that time,

198
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,920
it would be better.

199
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,760
Okay.

200
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:55,880
I promise you.

201
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,517
It's so late now.

202
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,280
Tou Tou didn't even call us.

203
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,200
We couldn't contact both of them.

204
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,840
That means they're together.

205
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,800
Tou Tou isn't afraid of anything.

206
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,520
If Tian Zhen is with her,

207
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,760
there shouldn't be a problem.

208
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,480
No news is good news.

209
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,360
What's the matter, Tou Tou?

210
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,240
Does it still hurt?

211
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,840
How does it feel compared to just now?

212
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,320
It hurts more than before.

213
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,520
This...

214
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,560
Let's go to the ER. It's very dangerous.

215
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,840
No need for that.

216
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,200
I know how things stand.

217
00:13:18,633 --> 00:13:19,717
How about this?

218
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,840
I'll call my dad.

219
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,200
Lie down and wait for me.

220
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,000
Who is it?

221
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,400
I don't know.

222
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,040
Take the call.

223
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,000
Hello.

224
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,720
Hello, Dad. Please save Tou Tou.

225
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,200
Speak slowly. What happened to Tou Tou?

226
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,520
She has sudden abdominal pain.

227
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,960
Her tongue is in red, coated in yellow.

228
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,920
She has a string-like, rapid pulse.

229
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,440
I think it may be appendicitis.

230
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,440
(And, I'm afraid
it has festered and perforated.)

231
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,637
Have you done acupuncture on her?

232
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,840
Yes. And she had taken the medicine.

233
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,280
What medicine did you prescribe?

234
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,600
(Rhubarb, 30g.)

235
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,800
Rhubarb, 30g.

236
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,237
-(Tree peony bark, 12g.)
-Tree peony bark, 12g.

237
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,080
(Peach kernel.)
(Ten grams.)

238
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,276
Peach kernel, 10g.

239
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,520
(Winter melon seeds, 20g.)

240
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,480
Winter melon seeds, 20g.

241
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,760
(Tian Zhen.)

242
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,520
(Your rhubarb and
peony prescription is not bad. )

243
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,280
But you used a lot of rhubarb.

244
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,400
Why is that?

245
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,317
She is an the emergency!

246
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,877
I think it's necessary to use
a stronger dose for emergency cases.

247
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,880
-That's why I...
-This is not medical science.

248
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,637
The most important thing
in TCM treatment

249
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,517
is based on syndrome differentiation!

250
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,920
How could you add or reduce the dose
without differentiating the syndrome?

251
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,480
(Take her to the ER now.
The sooner the better)

252
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,720
Okay, I'll do it right away.

253
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,160
Tou Tou, what are you doing?

254
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,520
Tian Zhen...

255
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,837
I'm not going to the hospital.

256
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,757
I've told you, I know where it stands.

257
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,117
You don't even listen to my dad now?

258
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,638
Let's go now.
I don't know where it stands now.

259
00:15:03,721 --> 00:15:05,637
I've told you, I'm not going!

260
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,837
What am I going to do with my life

261
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,957
if something happens to you? Let's go!

262
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:08,957
I really don't want to go!

263
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,800
Just believe in yourself, Ren Tian Zhen!

264
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,437
If you're going to do this again,
just go outside!

265
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,400
Just wait outside!

266
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,877
What happened to Tian Zhen?
Where are they?

267
00:15:24,961 --> 00:15:26,321
What's wrong with Tou Tou?

268
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,160
Your son is fine.

269
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,480
I...

270
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,560
What about Tou Tou?

271
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,840
Is Tian Zhen back?

272
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,080
Mrs. Song.

273
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,720
I'm looking for my master.

274
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,880
He's looking for you.

275
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:21,880
Acute abdomen?

276
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:23,640
Yes.

277
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,560
Has it festered?

278
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,200
I have no idea.

279
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,080
Why use such a strong dose then?

280
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,440
Who prescribed this?

281
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,720
Tian Zhen.

282
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,800
Who is the patient?

283
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:47,960
Sun Tou Tou.

284
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,640
Tou Tou?

285
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,800
Then this prescription will work.

286
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,680
"Overkill to right a wrong."

287
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,040
For Tou Tou, this prescription

288
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,760
is just nice.

289
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,400
Go and sleep without worries.

290
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,240
Thank you, Master.

291
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,400
Tian Zhen.

292
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,320
Let's go.

293
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,757
Let's go to the hospital now.

294
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,240
Bring that medicine over.

295
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,720
Do you still want to drink it?

296
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,320
Just bring it over.

297
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,320
No!

298
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,200
I think before we start dating,

299
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,920
we should set some rules.

300
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,680
If we don't set the rules,
we can't be good.

301
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,680
What rules?

302
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,160
For major matters, listen to me.

303
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,840
For minor matters, listen to you.

304
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,237
What is considered
a major or minor matter then?

305
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,560
I'll make the call
on the standards of it.

306
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,360
Like this situation now,

307
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,480
a matter of life and death,

308
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,840
it's a major matter, right?

309
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,237
Listen to me, okay?

310
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,120
Go get the medicine.

311
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,480
No.

312
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,400
What if you're dead
after taking the medicine?

313
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,240
If I'm dead after taking the medicine,

314
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,800
then congratulations.

315
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,680
This is your shortest-term girlfriend.

316
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,120
Go now.

317
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,280
Please come in.

318
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,080
I'm sorry.

319
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,800
Sorry for troubling you.

320
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,040
-You tell them.
-Okay.

321
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,600
I think you should tell them.

322
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,320
It's okay, just say it.

323
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,160
Well, it's like this.

324
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,000
There is an Uncle Niu in the town.

325
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,317
He has psoriasis.

326
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,077
He has been treated for decades,
but he hasn't recovered.

327
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,477
The thing is, he feels itchy
at night that he can't sleep at all.

328
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,400
-Am I right?
-Yes.

329
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,997
We've persuaded him

330
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,280
and asked him not to come now.

331
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,880
-But he has come and will never leave.
-That's right.

332
00:19:14,961 --> 00:19:17,280
So, we have to
trouble you to go and check him.

333
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,597
Please check him.

334
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,680
Actually, it's like this.

335
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,200
Psoriasis is a chronic disease.

336
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,920
It may take a while to treat him.

337
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,160
But Tou Tou and I
won't stay here for long.

338
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,320
Well, it's not easy to treat psoriasis.

339
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,200
But you can treat insomnia.

340
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,997
Alright, I'll go with you.

341
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,226
-Okay.
-Auntie.

342
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:39,710
Please get the medicine for Tou Tou.

343
00:19:41,373 --> 00:19:42,397
Okay.

344
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,506
Alright.

345
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,320
Sleep early.

346
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,680
You can't sleep either, right?

347
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,800
Are you worried about your son?

348
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,320
Look. He treated a patient.

349
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,117
But that has scared me.

350
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,600
That almost took half of my life.

351
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,040
I felt tenser

352
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,240
than I treat patients on my own.

353
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,800
Raising a son

354
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,600
is no fun.

355
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,400
That's right.

356
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,720
You're heartless.

357
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,800
How could you still sleep?

358
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,320
How could you still sleep?

359
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,080
He is considered good.

360
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,840
He knew

361
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,640
he should use
rhubarb and tree peony bark.

362
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,760
It's just that
the doses were slightly higher.

363
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,400
Can the tiny Tou Tou

364
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,120
bear it?

365
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,680
She can bear it.

366
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,800
You are so confident.

367
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,000
If she can't bear it,

368
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,080
she can't be the inheritor.

369
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,360
Tou Tou has a tough life.

370
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,000
Since she was young,

371
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,357
she has gone through many ups and downs.

372
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,040
It's a lot more than Tian Zhen.

373
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,800
"Heaven sent
a big responsibility to a man."

374
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,480
This difficulty
from Tian Zhen doesn't matter.

375
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,600
Think about this.

376
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:16,480
Back then,
to test Emperor Shun, Emperor Yao

377
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,040
put him in the forest

378
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,680
to wrestle with the beasts.

379
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,160
Compared to this,

380
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,600
Tou Tou's tests are nothing.

381
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,720
That's why
you think Tou Tou will be fine?

382
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,400
What reasoning is that?

383
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,440
And you're a TCM practitioner.

384
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,400
Back then, to test Emperor Shun,

385
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,600
Emperor Yao

386
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,800
even married off
his two daughters to him.

387
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,240
Why didn't you
mention the sweet part as well?

388
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,237
Well, I don't have two daughters.

389
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,840
I only have a grandson.

390
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,120
You,

391
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,517
me

392
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,560
and

393
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,600
Ling Lan, and Xin Zheng.

394
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,517
We practice medicine all
our lives and abide by medical ethics.

395
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,680
Just this fact alone,

396
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,400
our descendants will be good.

397
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,040
Don't worry.

398
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,120
Go to sleep.

399
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,800
I can't sleep.

400
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,477
Good morning, Auntie.

401
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,360
Good morning.

402
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,080
How is she?

403
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,320
I saw her go to
the toilet many times last night.

404
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,480
How is she now?

405
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,477
Auntie, she was fine after that.

406
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,680
I think she should be fine.

407
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,520
If one survives a catastrophe, she
is bound to have great fortune later on.

408
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,877
With a boyfriend like you,

409
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,480
no matter what happens,
God will avoid her.

410
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,840
Don't be shy.

411
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,080
I've been there.

412
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,640
The look in your eyes
when you carried her here,

413
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,800
I understood everything when I saw it.

414
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,440
Auntie, is it so obvious?

415
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,837
Do you need my help?

416
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,840
No, no.

417
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,040
I don't need your help here.

418
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,680
You'll be busy later.

419
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,680
Later?

420
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,000
What am I busy with?

421
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,437
Well, she still needs
to take medicine for a few days.

422
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,600
You definitely won't be able
to leave for the time being.

423
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,557
Look.

424
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,720
Can you please treat
all the sick people in this town?

425
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,357
Auntie, I'm worried that
my medical skills are not good enough.

426
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,597
No problem.

427
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,560
You're good.

428
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,040
I went to buy groceries just now.

429
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,280
When I passed by Uncle Niu's house,

430
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,477
I heard his loud snoring sound.

431
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:44,160
I think all his neighbors could hear.

432
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,400
As long as it's effective.

433
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,917
Auntie, I'm alone
and I'm inexperienced.

434
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,800
You can.

435
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,200
You can.

436
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,040
Auntie.

437
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,320
He can do it.

438
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,360
Yes.

439
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,037
Auntie, let me tell you.

440
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,277
He is a great doctor.

441
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,600
It's a great bargain that you found him.

442
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,720
That's right.

443
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,560
This is great.

444
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,560
We finally got a doctor to help us

445
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,000
with the consultation
from the first-tier city.

446
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:15,240
Our pharmacy will be famous too.

447
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,320
It's like it's consecrated.

448
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:17,880
You're too kind.

449
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:18,920
Doctor.

450
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,760
How much is your consultation fee?

451
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,520
It's a free consultation.

452
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,720
No money is required.

453
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,200
-A free consultation?
-That's right.

454
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,200
A free consultation?

455
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,800
That's great.

456
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,080
I'll tell Old He about this.

457
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,600
-Slow down!
-Slow down!

458
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,120
Tou Tou.

459
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,480
A free consultation?

460
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,160
A free consultation.

461
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,120
We'll do it together then.

462
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,360
Take this.

463
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,357
Listen to me.

464
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,800
It's not easy
to invite the great doctor here.

465
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,837
He hasn't had breakfast yet.

466
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,717
He'll treat everyone
after breakfast, okay?

467
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,680
We'll do this according to the number.

468
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,237
Everyone will get a number.

469
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,960
We'll call the number
and see the doctor, okay?

470
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,080
Come and get the number.

471
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,200
Uncle He!

472
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,197
Tao Zi, come here.

473
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,320
Come here, quick!

474
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,440
Come here. I'll give you a number.

475
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,600
Go and bring your grandma over.

476
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,360
She'll see a doctor to treat
her rheumatism with this number.

477
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,600
How much does it cost to see a doctor?

478
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,517
No money is needed.

479
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,840
This is a free consultation.

480
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,877
My grandma isn't willing
to spend money on medical treatment.

481
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,837
I'll bear it.

482
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,160
Come on, let me tell you. Look.

483
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,120
The doctor brought it from the city.

484
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,117
It's a black sesame ball. Try it.

485
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,560
It's delicious and healthy.

486
00:28:34,887 --> 00:28:35,927
It smells good.

487
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:37,620
It's molten sesame filling!

488
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,237
Uncle He, you must keep your word.

489
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,117
I'm going to ask
my grandma to come over.

490
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,160
Go now.

491
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,320
Go.

492
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,437
-Aunt Zhang, here you go.
-Hello.

493
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,277
-Distribute this to everyone.
-Okay.

494
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,680
Come and get this.

495
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,720
Hold it.

496
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,600
Line up.

497
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,680
This is very good for the body.

498
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,597
After the doctor checks you,

499
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,920
only us...

500
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:00,997
Whoever needs or wants it,

501
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,837
you can buy some
and eat it for your health.

502
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,477
This is just like a general hospital.

503
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,560
There are so many of them.

504
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,760
Girl, doctor.

505
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,320
Come and eat.

506
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,800
You should eat more today.

507
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,120
Whoever needs or wants it,

508
00:29:16,201 --> 00:29:18,237
you can buy some
and eat it for your health.

509
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,120
Am I right?

510
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,240
Let's go and eat.

511
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:49,160
Tell me. Why Tian Zhen and Tou Tou

512
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,120
aren't home yet?

513
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,680
The two of them
are doing good deeds now.

514
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,400
What good deed?

515
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,717
Tou Tou called me just now.

516
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,680
She said she hasn't fully recovered yet.

517
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,440
She still needs to rest for a few days.

518
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,400
It just so happens that

519
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,560
Tian Zhen
will provide a free consultation.

520
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,360
They said that in the village,

521
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,200
the queue line is very long.

522
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,280
There are all kinds of diseases.

523
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,760
Right now, when your son

524
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,600
goes to the washroom,

525
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,800
he needs to finish it in seconds.

526
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,400
Don't underestimate
people at the countryside.

527
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,080
They have many kinds of diseases
and a history of that.

528
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,280
It's not easy to treat them.

529
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,320
Don't worry.

530
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,357
If he encounters any problems,

531
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,560
he will call and ask us.

532
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:37,960
How about

533
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,560
we go there too?

534
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:40,840
We might as well

535
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,920
provide free consultation
on a big scale.

536
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,800
Just believe in your son.

537
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,080
He is launching his career now.

538
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,400
We must trust him.

539
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,320
Did you

540
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,680
eat anything delicious today?

541
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,720
You've never trusted him.

542
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,157
We should ask Tian Zhen

543
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,317
to write down all prescriptions

544
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,400
and send them all back
for us to have a look.

545
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,077
When you first checked a patient,

546
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,520
was your dad with you?

547
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,717
No.

548
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,320
Well, this is what your dad said.

549
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,477
"Distrust of children

550
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,600
is a curse on children."

551
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,880
Trust that our son

552
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,200
will surpass us in the future.

553
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,320
You two are chit-chatting.

554
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:46,760
Shan Dao.

555
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,037
Your lecture is in Room 203.

556
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,037
Let me take you there.

557
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,597
I know. Don't rush about it.

558
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,120
I just came over to say hello

559
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,720
and give him a card.

560
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,560
What card?

561
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,440
From the alumni association.

562
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,280
Don't we have a gathering every year?

563
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,640
This is strange.

564
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:11,040
He has never praised his son
but he just did it.

565
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,437
He has never joined the reunion class

566
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,840
but he's going now.

567
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,800
And pigs might fly.

568
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:25,840
Is there anything?

569
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,840
Nothing, nothing.

570
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,040
Continue with your talk.

571
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:30,960
I'm going to the class now.

572
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:31,880
I'm going now.

573
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,400
The class reunion...
Almost thirty years.

574
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,400
Little Lark is going too.

575
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,200
I'm attending Shan Dao's class.

576
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,200
Ms. Song.

577
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,920
Mr. Ren asked me to invite you

578
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,680
to Prof. Wu's class.

579
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,557
I'm ordering lunch.

580
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,317
Yesterday, didn't you ask me to order

581
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,400
a stomach-nourishing soup for Mr. Ren?

582
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,880
What soup nourishes the stomach?

583
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,317
There are papaya chicken soup

584
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,237
and keel...

585
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,160
Ms. Song.

586
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,880
What's with her?

587
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,240
I don't know.

588
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,320
Did Prof. Ren make her angry?

589
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,640
Should I order
this stomach-nourishing soup?

590
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,600
Of course, order it.

591
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,920
She ignored me.

592
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,080
It's alright.

593
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,957
She will forget after a while.

594
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,080
I've never seen anyone
who loves her husband more than her.

595
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,280
What else?

596
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,077
Who ordered sesame paste?

597
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,160
Order one for me too.

598
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,720
I ordered it for you.

599
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,437
Didn't you say you like it?

600
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,400
I saw it, so I ordered it for you.

601
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,520
Thank you.

602
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,680
There's no class
tomorrow afternoon, right?

603
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,640
How about coming to my house?

604
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,600
The model you made with Le Le
hasn't been completed, right?

605
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,680
He keeps asking me

606
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,960
when will that uncle
who doesn't talk come.

607
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,760
So, we've decided.

608
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,240
Have dinner at our house.

609
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,040
I should talk more.

610
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:05,960
You're home.

611
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,360
Gosh, it's so sumptuous.

612
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:08,880
Do you have good news?

613
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,720
Yes, there is something to celebrate.

614
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:12,760
Really?

615
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,600
What a coincidence.

616
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,720
I have good news to share with you too.

617
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,200
Really?

618
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,717
It's double happiness then!

619
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,680
Go wash your hands and eat.

620
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:38,920
Cut.

621
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,720
Cut, cut.

622
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,160
Cut.

623
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,320
What are you doing?

624
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,360
Got into a fight with Xin Zheng again?

625
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,360
Who is Xin Zheng? I don't know him.

626
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,640
Don't get mad at my flowers.

627
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,600
You...

628
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,280
It's mine.

629
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,280
It's all mine!

630
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,640
Let me tell you.

631
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:04,000
Sulking will block the mammary gland.

632
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,120
Mom.

633
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,320
Tell me. Are men

634
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,480
children who will never grow?

635
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,400
You put your heart and soul into them,

636
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,797
but they would never appreciate it.

637
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,957
Stop it, stop it.

638
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,120
You make me dizzy.

639
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,480
Are you talking about
the old or young one?

640
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,600
Both are the same.

641
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,360
Let's talk about the young one.

642
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,800
He's like doesn't have a family.

643
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,357
He's not like Tou Tou

644
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,600
who would call
and tell us that she was fine.

645
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,800
Look at him.

646
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,800
It's been days

647
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,640
but he didn't call us at all.

648
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,440
That old...

649
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,960
Let's not talk about the old one.

650
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,360
I...

651
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,780
I don't even want to talk about it.

652
00:37:53,179 --> 00:37:55,059
Well, you're like a young girl.

653
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,317
It's okay to say that to me.

654
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,720
If you tell your dad that,

655
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,400
he'll say that you...

656
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,720
Have improper thoughts.

657
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,400
Well,

658
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,360
whether it's the husband or the son,

659
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:19,120
including this house and plants,

660
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:22,320
in the end, it won't be yours alone.

661
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,960
Since this is the case,

662
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,240
why must you make them
live according to your wishes?

663
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,200
Mom.

664
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:39,160
How did you spend
your lifetime with Dad?

665
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,560
I've spent half my life with Xin Zheng.

666
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,277
But I feel that

667
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,680
I still can't understand his mind.

668
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,520
A lifetime is so long.

669
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,240
Why do you want to understand his mind?

670
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,280
He is by your side.

671
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,120
That's the best thing.

672
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:58,597
Let me tell you.

673
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,480
A marriage

674
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,640
is actually paddling
a tandem paddle board.

675
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,037
You must find someone

676
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:05,360
who rows in the same direction as you,

677
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,440
not someone holding you back.

678
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,720
I think Xin Zheng is very good.

679
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,440
You two have common topics to talk about

680
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,400
and have careers together, right?

681
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,440
You two are a couple for life.

682
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,800
But why do I feel like

683
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,680
I'm on the paddle board by myself

684
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,680
while he is on the shore.

685
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,240
He didn't board at all.

686
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,037
Well, who was it then

687
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,400
that cried so hard
and said wanted to marry him?

688
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,120
It was me.

689
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,520
Well, I think

690
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,877
what really touched me was

691
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,640
his belief in
traditional Chinese medicine.

692
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,557
You know what?

693
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,640
At that time, I firmly believed that

694
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,437
he needs a good wife like me.

695
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,880
That's it.

696
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,760
Let's not say something great.

697
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,240
Don't you like him at all?

698
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,960
Back then, so many people liked you.

699
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,720
Even Wu Shan Dao

700
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,640
brought you to smell the flowers

701
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,960
and see the spring cherry.

702
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,757
He was busy all around

703
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,477
for one whole year but it was fruitless,

704
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:20,120
because you don't love him, am I right?

705
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,480
That's right.

706
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,440
Xin Zheng is firm and unwavering.

707
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,240
He's not like Wu Shan Dao

708
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,040
who was cunning.

709
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,760
Well, I think

710
00:40:28,841 --> 00:40:31,597
it was Xin Zheng
who didn't take a closer look at you.

711
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,760
When he reached our house,

712
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,800
he went straight to his master's study.

713
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,800
I wonder who was it that

714
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:39,277
sent an apple

715
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,720
and then a cup of tea to the study.

716
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,120
I didn't.

717
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,080
I...

718
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,720
I was being a good daughter to my dad.

719
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,797
So, after he has become my son-in-law,

720
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,600
you've stopped being
a good daughter to your dad?

721
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,660
Why are you so annoying?

722
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,317
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

723
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,717
(are referenced from relevant
traditional Chinese medicine books)
