1
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,705
(Gen Z)

2
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,600
(Episode 4)

3
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,719
You applied for the
National Health Fund.

4
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,579
But now, you're building buildings
for R&D of decoction pieces.

5
00:01:44,019 --> 00:01:45,540
And, you're just building them
without any of the R&D.

6
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:48,019
It doesn't fit the description
of projects that we support.

7
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,660
Sir,

8
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:50,820
I've told you before.

9
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,900
This is the incubation centre
of TCM herbs.

10
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:56,100
It's just a tiny part
of our industrial park.

11
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,859
Sir, look at the opposite building.

12
00:02:00,139 --> 00:02:01,219
We're preparing to bring in

13
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,699
a first-class
physical examination centre,

14
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:04,740
which is a listed company too.

15
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,660
The Grade A tertiary hospitals
will move here within five years.

16
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,540
The preventative treatments
and recovery processes

17
00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:10,980
will be done in our centre

18
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:12,459
after the Grade A tertiary hospitals.

19
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,941
Sir,

20
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,899
this is our plan for national health.

21
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,824
Mr Liu,

22
00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:21,619
you're talking about five years
from now, or even ten years from now.

23
00:02:22,259 --> 00:02:24,180
Everyone can achieve something
after getting an investment.

24
00:02:24,299 --> 00:02:25,419
However, we only have
so much money right now

25
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:28,459
and we have to invest in someone
whose business is already established.

26
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:32,540
This is just an empty
industrial factory.

27
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,299
Where is your sincerity?

28
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,400
Chief Secretary,

29
00:02:38,643 --> 00:02:39,499
Director,

30
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:41,740
do you guys know

31
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:42,899
Ren Xin Zheng?

32
00:02:43,259 --> 00:02:44,565
Professor Ren of the University of TCM?

33
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,460
That's right.

34
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,380
Of course I know him.

35
00:02:47,899 --> 00:02:49,340
My father always went to him

36
00:02:49,539 --> 00:02:50,380
whenever he was sick.

37
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:52,660
Professor Ren

38
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:55,179
is just like the banner
of Jiangzhou City.

39
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,299
He's well-known throughout the country.

40
00:02:57,299 --> 00:02:58,499
That's right.

41
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:00,020
Professor Ren

42
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:03,179
is the biggest sincerity we can show.

43
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:07,780
In the healthcare industry,

44
00:03:08,179 --> 00:03:10,740
nurturing talent is a main element.

45
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:13,700
To nurture talents,
we must have good education.

46
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,980
Both of you should know this.

47
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,819
As long as Professor Ren is here,

48
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:20,420
he has a set of complete
education blueprint.

49
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,939
Once he opens his academy,

50
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,460
and he pumps out those talents,

51
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,539
the healthcare industry park

52
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,579
will have nothing to worry about.

53
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,060
Is he here?

54
00:03:30,259 --> 00:03:31,147
That's right.

55
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,539
He already resigned from his post.

56
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,299
He's here to support my business.

57
00:03:34,899 --> 00:03:36,100
He and his students

58
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,700
are living on my property right now.

59
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,740
I guess I found him by chance, huh?

60
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:42,259
My father

61
00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:44,259
was just complaining that Professor Ren

62
00:03:44,259 --> 00:03:45,819
had stopped giving people diagnoses.

63
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,659
His nameplate was also removed from

64
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:50,739
the TCM affiliated hospital's
Department of Internal Medicine.

65
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,340
I didn't expect

66
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,659
to find him here.

67
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,837
Let's go.

68
00:03:55,099 --> 00:03:56,459
Let's visit Professor Ren.

69
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:57,300
Please.

70
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,300
I'm afraid this will be a busy place

71
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,539
in the future.

72
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:23,884
Professor Ren.

73
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,420
Look who's here.

74
00:04:25,452 --> 00:04:26,275
Professor Ren.

75
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,739
Congratulations on the opening
of your apprentice class.

76
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,420
Thank you.

77
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,259
Professor Ren,

78
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,539
do you still remember me?

79
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,659
I can't remember faces well.

80
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,140
I'm sure you remember my father then.

81
00:04:39,659 --> 00:04:42,580
It's Mr Cao, who always
had tinnitus issues.

82
00:04:42,819 --> 00:04:43,819
Cao Fang Hua.

83
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,019
You cured his tinnitus.

84
00:04:46,179 --> 00:04:49,300
I accompanied my father to see you
several times.

85
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:50,500
I see.

86
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,659
You see,

87
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:54,300
I had examined too many patients.

88
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,420
That's why I...

89
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,539
I understand.

90
00:04:57,379 --> 00:04:58,899
Among the projects

91
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,140
that the government will support,

92
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,700
they'll allocate a significant portion

93
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,259
for education purposes.

94
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:05,980
Professor Ren, you can apply
for government subsidy

95
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,860
for the apprentice class you're holding.

96
00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:09,068
That's right.

97
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,700
That's why we invited Director Xia

98
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,860
and Chief Secretary Cao
from the National Health Fund.

99
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,220
Let's see if there's a way for us
to cooperate.

100
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,300
I've already applied for it.

101
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,588
But it wasn't approved.

102
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:23,060
That's why I'm doing it right now.

103
00:05:23,539 --> 00:05:24,980
You're highly revered.

104
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:25,860
They'll surely approve it.

105
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:26,685
Yes.

106
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,819
Professor Ren, can you tell us
about the planning

107
00:05:30,099 --> 00:05:30,987
for your apprentice class?

108
00:05:31,459 --> 00:05:32,700
There's no planning.

109
00:05:33,259 --> 00:05:34,580
I'm taking it one step at a time.

110
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,700
The passing down of TCM culture
halted for many years.

111
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,179
That's why I'm figuring things out
as I go.

112
00:05:40,179 --> 00:05:41,259
I'm taking it one step at a time.

113
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,739
Professor Ren's biggest flaw is modesty.

114
00:05:45,739 --> 00:05:47,659
He has been in the TCM field
his entire life.

115
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,899
He educates people and
provides diagnosis.

116
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:51,539
That's why he already has
a well-thought-out strategy.

117
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:52,460
That's not it.

118
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,269
Not at all.

119
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,620
It will never work without

120
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,900
the help of superiors like you two.

121
00:05:57,259 --> 00:05:57,860
What about this?

122
00:05:58,099 --> 00:05:59,740
There's no time like the present.

123
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,700
Let's request the professor
to read our pulse.

124
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:02,980
-Sure.
-Sure.

125
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:03,980
Not today.

126
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,740
I have a class to teach.

127
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,499
You guys can come again

128
00:06:08,499 --> 00:06:09,860
when I'm not teaching.

129
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,099
We might not have time next time.

130
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,980
If you have needs,

131
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,059
you'll make time for it.

132
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,720
This is...

133
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:18,860
If so,

134
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,339
we should not trouble him.

135
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,379
I'm sure you two are perfectly healthy.

136
00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:23,539
Just read our pulse for fun.

137
00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:24,740
For fun, okay? Come on.

138
00:06:25,539 --> 00:06:26,980
I won't see you guys off then.

139
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,939
You guys are welcome

140
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:30,980
to attend my lesson.

141
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,659
Maybe you can put
what you learned to use in the future.

142
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,099
What lesson will you be teaching today?

143
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,059
Cerebral infarction, heart attack,
epilepsy,

144
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,860
Yang depletion syndrome, and so on.

145
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,339
I'll talk about TCM first-aid
for such situations.

146
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,860
Before we talk about TCM first-aid,

147
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,099
I would like to ask you guys this.

148
00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:53,539
What are the "eyes"
for TCM practitioners?

149
00:06:54,659 --> 00:06:55,500
Anyone?

150
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:57,797
Yin and Yang.

151
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:58,819
That's right.

152
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,300
Yin and Yang.

153
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,420
So, how can we differentiate
between Yin and Yang?

154
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,939
Oh no, we're studying metaphysics again.

155
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,912
This is not metaphysics.

156
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,580
It's easy to identify them.

157
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:17,300
Before we learned how to stand and walk,

158
00:07:17,539 --> 00:07:18,420
we had to crawl.

159
00:07:20,659 --> 00:07:24,020
The area where your back faces
the sunlight is known as Yang.

160
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:27,339
Yin is the area
where it faces the ground.

161
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,180
There are three Yangs and three Yins
in the human body.

162
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:33,180
Tai Yang, Shao Yang, and Yang Ming.

163
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,580
Tai Yin, Jue Yin, and Shao Yin.

164
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,900
They have
an interconnected relationship.

165
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,499
So, what does the term
"interconnected" mean?

166
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:42,020
Outsiders will be confused

167
00:07:43,099 --> 00:07:43,900
when they hear the term.

168
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,420
Actually,

169
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,460
it's very simple.

170
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:48,676
Guys, take a look.

171
00:07:49,819 --> 00:07:51,860
This is the surface.

172
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,099
On the other side,

173
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,221
this is the interior.

174
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,140
Yang Ming Meridian is on the surface.

175
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:01,860
Tai Yin Meridian is inside.

176
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,300
Shao Yang Meridian is on the surface.

177
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:07,300
On the contrary,
Jue Yin Meridian is inside.

178
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,939
Tai Yang Meridian is on the surface.

179
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,659
Shao Yin Meridian

180
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:15,925
is inside.

181
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,939
It's very convenient to know this.

182
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,420
Understood?

183
00:08:26,379 --> 00:08:27,212
Tou Tou.

184
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,981
Tou Tou!

185
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:30,099
Is it lunchtime?

186
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:33,259
It's not lunchtime.

187
00:08:34,339 --> 00:08:35,180
It's not time yet.

188
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,300
Guys, stop laughing.

189
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,980
Tou Tou's able to sit here

190
00:08:40,939 --> 00:08:41,939
and focus so deeply

191
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,620
that she fell asleep.

192
00:08:46,099 --> 00:08:47,860
The Chinese language

193
00:08:49,099 --> 00:08:50,460
is deep and complex.

194
00:08:50,939 --> 00:08:53,659
There are two parts to the human body.

195
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:55,300
First, it's "Xing", which means shape.

196
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,860
Second, it's "Shen",
which means spirit or focus.

197
00:08:58,499 --> 00:08:59,980
I realised something.

198
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:03,659
Although some of you
are in this classroom,

199
00:09:04,339 --> 00:09:06,900
your focus isn't here.

200
00:09:07,539 --> 00:09:09,180
You're scrolling your phone instead.

201
00:09:09,499 --> 00:09:11,339
I think Tou Tou is better than you.

202
00:09:11,539 --> 00:09:13,420
At least Tou Tou's so focused

203
00:09:13,659 --> 00:09:14,499
that she fell asleep.

204
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,580
I truly hope you guys

205
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,620
can cherish our class.

206
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,779
If you don't feel like listening,
you can sleep.

207
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:26,219
Sleeping leads to revitalization.

208
00:09:26,219 --> 00:09:27,059
Revitalization

209
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,740
leads to enlightenment,

210
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:29,700
and enlightenment leads to awakening.

211
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:34,420
I think sleeping is better
than scrolling one's phone.

212
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,740
Maybe

213
00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:39,779
an enlightened one will
be born in our class

214
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,099
after sleeping.

215
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,684
Go ahead.

216
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:47,460
I need to head to the toilet.

217
00:09:58,059 --> 00:09:58,939
Go ahead.

218
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,223
(Passing down of TCM)

219
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,339
Why aren't they back yet?

220
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,659
Do you know how long I've been waiting?

221
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,539
Aren't you guys hungry?

222
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,684
Handsome,

223
00:10:38,219 --> 00:10:39,860
stop pulling a long face.

224
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,219
It's bad for your health

225
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,740
if you keep sulking like this.

226
00:10:43,339 --> 00:10:44,227
Don't you think so?

227
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,980
Don't act like your father.

228
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,068
Let me ask you something.

229
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,740
Say, will your father make kids cry

230
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,099
when he gives them a diagnosis?

231
00:10:51,099 --> 00:10:51,940
I'm sure he will.

232
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,539
Your mother must've
had it rough if she has

233
00:10:53,539 --> 00:10:54,420
to spend time with him all day long.

234
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,860
I knew there was food!

235
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,860
Calm down.

236
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,155
Tou Tou,

237
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,219
it's difficult to order food for you.

238
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,740
You'll complain about the ingredients,

239
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,740
the cook,

240
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,659
the taste, and the freshness...

241
00:11:12,659 --> 00:11:14,300
Enough already.

242
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,180
Listen. I've made at least
1,000 food deliveries

243
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,380
by now.

244
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,275
I'm not bragging here.

245
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,260
I can tell which restaurants
these orders are from

246
00:11:19,659 --> 00:11:21,740
by just taking a sniff.

247
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,860
The ones I told you to avoid

248
00:11:24,219 --> 00:11:25,139
are not that good.

249
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:26,067
Understood?

250
00:11:28,099 --> 00:11:29,420
Words alone are no proof.

251
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,300
Besides the restaurants

252
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,180
you acknowledged,

253
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:34,180
we've also ordered food from
several restaurants nearby

254
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,076
with the best rating.

255
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,355
Try them out.

256
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,420
If you think they're okay,

257
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,219
we can order them

258
00:11:38,219 --> 00:11:39,500
without any issues in the future.

259
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,420
Try them?

260
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,260
Does that mean I can try all of them?

261
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,196
Of course.

262
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,315
(Sun Tou Tou's Taste Test)

263
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,060
I'm ready.

264
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,180
Let's begin.

265
00:12:01,539 --> 00:12:02,420
Use the serving chopsticks.

266
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:03,860
The others can't have the rest

267
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:04,980
if you try them with
your own chopsticks.

268
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,180
You're so annoying.

269
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,740
Why don't you serve me instead?

270
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,699
This must be from Shudaonan.

271
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:19,380
They mainly serve Sichuan cuisine.

272
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,980
However, in order to accommodate
the taste of Jiangzhou,

273
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,180
it's not sweet or spicy enough.

274
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,019
Don't order from them.

275
00:12:24,019 --> 00:12:24,980
Their quality has deteriorated.

276
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,019
Come. Try the next one.

277
00:12:28,779 --> 00:12:29,820
You don't need to open it.

278
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,060
I could tell which restaurant
it was from

279
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:31,860
when you brought it in.

280
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,180
This is my favourite restaurant.

281
00:12:33,539 --> 00:12:35,420
Nongjia Cuisine's
Large Intestines with Stinky Tofu.

282
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,293
Look.

283
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:39,300
They added broad beans and peppercorns.
It smells heavenly!

284
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,860
I was wondering who ordered it.
I knew it was you.

285
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,139
Everyone can smell it from
three miles away.

286
00:12:42,139 --> 00:12:42,980
Next one.

287
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,180
-Is this mine?
-This one.

288
00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:49,579
Peng Shi Yan, you're something else.

289
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:51,740
This is from Xiaochun Japanese Cuisine.

290
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,219
You actually ordered
such expensive food?

291
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,300
Can we afford to have this every day?

292
00:12:55,779 --> 00:12:56,980
You can tell just from
trying their egg roll?

293
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,539
I don't think you're
a food delivery rider.

294
00:12:59,539 --> 00:13:00,420
Give me another piece.

295
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,620
You're more like
a Michelin guide inspector.

296
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,740
Next one.

297
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,659
Can you tell or not?

298
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,860
Wait. This tastes strange.

299
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:27,539
Sauteed alfalfa with rice liquor.

300
00:13:27,539 --> 00:13:29,420
They used a mixture of Erguotou
and rice liquor.

301
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,400
It can only be from the Ginkgo
Restaurant at the junction.

302
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,275
Am I right?

303
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,134
However, this dish is...

304
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,219
Both the heat control and texture
are different.

305
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,380
Did they make this?

306
00:13:37,219 --> 00:13:38,060
Tou Tou,

307
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:39,940
you're truly impressive.

308
00:13:40,339 --> 00:13:41,899
They did change their cook.

309
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,980
The chubby cook went
to open his own stall.

310
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,420
The current cook is his student.

311
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,860
I know! It's that skinny guy.

312
00:13:49,539 --> 00:13:52,099
He doesn't control the heat well.

313
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,149
Wait.

314
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,420
How could you afford to order food

315
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,620
from a fancy restaurant
like Ginkgo Restaurant?

316
00:13:59,099 --> 00:14:00,659
The lunch box had a hole in it

317
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,840
when the food delivery rider
delivered the food to us last time.

318
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,180
I said it was the work of that rider.

319
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,099
You guys didn't believe me.

320
00:14:07,539 --> 00:14:09,339
Do all food delivery riders
have the same habit?

321
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,099
Peng Shi Yan, are you out of your mind?

322
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,180
What do you mean by that?

323
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,260
Are you looking down on
food delivery riders?

324
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,539
That's not it.

325
00:14:21,539 --> 00:14:22,459
Listen.

326
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,899
So what if you're a paediatrician?

327
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:25,940
Do you think you earn a lot of money

328
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:26,980
compared to me?

329
00:14:27,099 --> 00:14:28,260
Be careful! Don't slip and fall.

330
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,080
Come here!

331
00:14:29,099 --> 00:14:30,420
Do you think you earn a lot?

332
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,891
I'm making much more money than you!

333
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,720
That was heartbreaking.

334
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,200
You shouldn't expose other people's
shortcomings when you curse them.

335
00:14:34,339 --> 00:14:35,212
Tou Tou,

336
00:14:36,099 --> 00:14:38,180
did you learn all of these
when you were a food delivery rider?

337
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,060
I had to deliver food every day.

338
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,219
I had no time to learn.

339
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,868
Tou,

340
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,339
I'm impressed.

341
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,620
In the future, I'll listen to you
when it comes to food delivery.

342
00:14:56,659 --> 00:14:57,659
Who ordered this?

343
00:14:57,659 --> 00:14:58,579
Why isn't anyone taking it?

344
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,373
Son.

345
00:15:08,539 --> 00:15:09,740
-Mum.
-Niece-in-law,

346
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:11,500
you're pretty particular.

347
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,420
Illness finds its way in by the mouth.

348
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,659
Trouble issues from the mouth too.

349
00:15:14,659 --> 00:15:16,420
If you control your mouth,

350
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,060
you can survive longer.

351
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,380
Was your mother insulting me just now?

352
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,539
Do you know how disposable dishware

353
00:15:47,539 --> 00:15:48,860
is made?

354
00:15:50,539 --> 00:15:52,099
Do you know all disposable dishware

355
00:15:52,099 --> 00:15:53,740
is bleached with hydrogen peroxide?

356
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,659
Do you know the disposable dishware
you're using

357
00:15:56,659 --> 00:15:57,699
might be expired

358
00:15:57,699 --> 00:16:00,060
and might contain E.coli
and hepatitis virus?

359
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,980
There's mold on your chopsticks.

360
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,579
And, you've swallowed it.

361
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,659
Enough. Stop talking, alright?

362
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,980
Your mother said so herself.

363
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,980
Trouble issues from the mouth.

364
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:15,899
I can survive for two more years
if you just keep it to yourself.

365
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,339
She behaves like a hooligan.

366
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:25,139
Let's not bring them here tomorrow.

367
00:16:25,659 --> 00:16:26,539
We should be like them.

368
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:28,940
It's unhygienic, you know?

369
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:32,219
Pathogenic factors cannot invade the
body with enough healthy qi inside.

370
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,940
I can tell

371
00:16:36,539 --> 00:16:38,180
that you're a prince at home.

372
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,659
You've never endured any hardships.

373
00:16:39,659 --> 00:16:41,260
You even eat like a prince.

374
00:16:42,659 --> 00:16:43,699
You'll starve to death
if you eat like that.

375
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,659
You have to eat quickly.

376
00:16:45,659 --> 00:16:47,099
Only then, you'll get full.

377
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,779
I can share your food with you

378
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:52,860
if you can't finish it.

379
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:07,459
Look at how she eats.

380
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:15,772
Tou Tou,

381
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:17,620
are you not full yet?

382
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,420
Look, I separated them.

383
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,459
If you don't mind,

384
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:22,659
you can have my share.

385
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,043
I'm coming!

386
00:17:31,382 --> 00:17:32,194
Thank you, my nephew.

387
00:17:32,219 --> 00:17:34,260
In ancient times, there was
an ancient beast called Taotie.

388
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:35,219
Its mouth was larger than its gills.

389
00:17:35,459 --> 00:17:36,579
It could swallow everything in one bite.

390
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,760
In the past, I used to think
that it was a male beast,

391
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,620
until I encountered Tou Tou.

392
00:17:41,219 --> 00:17:43,500
Do you know that all villains die
from talking too much?

393
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,049
Guys,

394
00:17:49,579 --> 00:17:51,539
I've helped you guys
to test all the food today.

395
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:53,860
I think the best is
Xiaochun Japanese Cuisine.

396
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,500
I have no issues having them

397
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,219
every day.

398
00:17:57,219 --> 00:17:58,940
-What do you guys think?
-You're too broke for that.

399
00:18:00,219 --> 00:18:01,032
Wait, you...

400
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,180
Why must you act like this?

401
00:18:02,339 --> 00:18:03,539
You say you have no money
when we're having nice food.

402
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:04,980
You say the ingredients aren't fresh
when we order cheap food.

403
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,539
What? You want everyone to starve?

404
00:18:06,579 --> 00:18:08,219
Let's choose the most
cost-effective one.

405
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,940
Luckily, they didn't use
gutter oil in their cooking.

406
00:18:11,339 --> 00:18:12,699
I'm fine with
the inferior food ingredients.

407
00:18:12,699 --> 00:18:13,579
I agree.

408
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,380
All take-out food is the same nowadays.

409
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,980
It's not like you can go into
their kitchen and instruct them.

410
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,060
I'm fine as long as
it can fill my tummy.

411
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,539
This place is too remote.

412
00:18:19,539 --> 00:18:21,180
We're lucky that we can order
food delivery here.

413
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,420
We should be grateful that
we have food to eat.

414
00:18:23,459 --> 00:18:24,579
This won't do!

415
00:18:24,579 --> 00:18:26,699
Why are we spending money on it
when we know that it isn't good?

416
00:18:26,699 --> 00:18:27,659
Doesn't that mean we're supporting

417
00:18:27,659 --> 00:18:29,099
a shoddy food trend here?

418
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,532
We must never compromise!

419
00:18:30,579 --> 00:18:31,579
Nice!

420
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:33,491
Hero Peng.

421
00:18:34,539 --> 00:18:35,659
You're Hero Peng to me.

422
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,240
Why don't we let
Peng Shi Yan be our class monitor?

423
00:18:39,339 --> 00:18:40,197
Are you guys okay with that?

424
00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:41,219
-Sure!
-Is that okay?

425
00:18:41,219 --> 00:18:42,780
Don't do that! Wait!

426
00:18:42,819 --> 00:18:43,740
Aren't we having lunch?

427
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,459
Why am I the class monitor now?

428
00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:46,339
Let's talk about the food.

429
00:18:46,819 --> 00:18:47,740
Talk about the food?

430
00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:51,339
What about this?

431
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:54,419
I'll cook for you guys in the future,

432
00:18:55,059 --> 00:18:55,866
okay?

433
00:18:56,939 --> 00:18:57,939
Can you even cook?

434
00:18:58,299 --> 00:18:59,860
Of course.

435
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:01,740
I would've been a head chef by now

436
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,140
if my nephew didn't want me

437
00:19:03,219 --> 00:19:04,459
to be his stupid successor.

438
00:19:05,939 --> 00:19:07,219
I'm serious.

439
00:19:07,459 --> 00:19:08,301
Okay then.

440
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,620
Tou Tou will be in charge of our food

441
00:19:11,059 --> 00:19:12,140
tomorrow.

442
00:19:12,339 --> 00:19:13,223
What do you think?

443
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,980
I want to order something.

444
00:19:17,939 --> 00:19:18,939
I want Shredded Pork with Garlic Sauce.

445
00:19:19,099 --> 00:19:19,995
Sure.

446
00:19:20,099 --> 00:19:20,980
Shredded Pork with Garlic Sauce.

447
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,179
-Okay.
-Tou Tou.

448
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,260
Can I order Braised Beef?

449
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,339
Sure.

450
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,980
Class monitor, take out
your pen and paper.

451
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:30,099
Tell him to jot down
what you want tomorrow.

452
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,099
What would you like to order?

453
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,699
Braised Fresh Abalone with Fish Maw.

454
00:19:37,699 --> 00:19:38,980
Braised Fresh Abalone...

455
00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:42,059
What the heck is that?

456
00:19:47,339 --> 00:19:48,740
Be careful not to hurt
my ginseng seedling.

457
00:19:52,219 --> 00:19:53,219
Mr Ren.

458
00:19:53,579 --> 00:19:54,579
I mean, Professor Ren.

459
00:19:54,579 --> 00:19:55,660
It's been so many years.

460
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:58,660
Have I ever spoiled your things before?

461
00:20:00,459 --> 00:20:03,419
I would be just like Sun Tou Tou
if I couldn't even differentiate between

462
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,059
ginseng seedlings and weeds.

463
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,219
Be careful.

464
00:20:11,059 --> 00:20:12,219
Why don't you do it yourself?

465
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:18,939
I know.

466
00:20:19,459 --> 00:20:21,660
You're taking a detour
to insult Sun Tou Tou.

467
00:20:22,459 --> 00:20:23,819
I didn't take a detour.

468
00:20:23,819 --> 00:20:25,179
I'm insulting her directly.

469
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,219
Sun Tou Tou

470
00:20:34,219 --> 00:20:35,819
is different from us.

471
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:38,699
She doesn't come from
a good family background like you.

472
00:20:38,939 --> 00:20:41,299
She's not as cultivated as us.

473
00:20:41,459 --> 00:20:43,020
No one taught her

474
00:20:43,219 --> 00:20:44,579
about courtesy

475
00:20:44,579 --> 00:20:45,939
or elegance.

476
00:20:45,939 --> 00:20:46,900
All of these

477
00:20:46,939 --> 00:20:49,699
should be provided during
the family education phase.

478
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:54,929
But now,

479
00:20:55,699 --> 00:20:57,219
it's our task to educate her.

480
00:20:59,421 --> 00:21:00,426
You see,

481
00:21:01,459 --> 00:21:03,179
she has a sharp sense

482
00:21:03,459 --> 00:21:04,699
of taste and smell.

483
00:21:05,819 --> 00:21:06,660
I think she can

484
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,780
be a TCM practitioner.

485
00:21:10,299 --> 00:21:11,660
That's just on you.

486
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:15,339
You should be more patient

487
00:21:15,819 --> 00:21:16,660
toward Sun Tou Tou.

488
00:21:19,059 --> 00:21:21,339
It's not like I'm not patient with her.

489
00:21:21,579 --> 00:21:24,540
I don't know her at all.

490
00:21:25,699 --> 00:21:27,219
Wu Shan Dao

491
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:29,099
just brought her here

492
00:21:29,099 --> 00:21:30,459
and left her to us.

493
00:21:30,819 --> 00:21:32,179
And, she's our senior too.

494
00:21:32,179 --> 00:21:34,699
I've never met a person like her before.

495
00:21:34,699 --> 00:21:36,540
How could I acknowledge
someone like that?

496
00:21:37,339 --> 00:21:39,980
You must believe in
the power of education.

497
00:21:40,579 --> 00:21:41,699
This is just the beginning.

498
00:21:41,699 --> 00:21:42,860
We still have a long way to go.

499
00:21:43,179 --> 00:21:44,459
If, one day,

500
00:21:44,819 --> 00:21:45,939
she couldn't be our successor

501
00:21:45,939 --> 00:21:47,059
or a TCM practitioner,

502
00:21:47,819 --> 00:21:49,380
at least she could become

503
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:52,419
a well-educated lady.

504
00:21:52,459 --> 00:21:54,699
We're helping society

505
00:21:54,699 --> 00:21:59,579
to nurture an educated
and well-mannered lady.

506
00:21:59,579 --> 00:22:01,059
This is merit too, am I right?

507
00:22:01,819 --> 00:22:03,099
Well-mannered lady, huh?

508
00:22:03,459 --> 00:22:04,380
Who do you think

509
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,939
will marry a girl like her?

510
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:07,740
You're spouting nonsense again.

511
00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:10,339
The Qingming Festival is nearing.

512
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,380
Remember to prepare her dress for her.

513
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:14,819
I was just saying.

514
00:22:14,819 --> 00:22:16,939
I'll still do my part without fail.

515
00:22:17,219 --> 00:22:18,699
I've already told Peng Shi Yan

516
00:22:18,699 --> 00:22:20,339
to take their measurements.

517
00:22:22,099 --> 00:22:23,299
Speaking of which,

518
00:22:23,299 --> 00:22:24,980
I have to discuss something with you.

519
00:22:25,939 --> 00:22:27,059
We have so many people here.

520
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:29,219
We have to spend money
for our daily expenditures, right?

521
00:22:29,357 --> 00:22:30,154
That's right.

522
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:32,459
Money doesn't fall from
the sky, you know?

523
00:22:32,459 --> 00:22:35,540
And, you can't grow them too.

524
00:22:37,339 --> 00:22:38,579
I'm talking to you.

525
00:22:38,579 --> 00:22:40,579
Will you look for sponsors?

526
00:22:40,579 --> 00:22:41,380
If we have to fork out

527
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:43,099
our own money all the time,

528
00:22:43,099 --> 00:22:44,260
I don't think we can sustain this.

529
00:22:47,419 --> 00:22:48,740
No effort goes in vain.

530
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:52,540
When we do good deeds,

531
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,219
do not bring them up.

532
00:22:56,699 --> 00:22:59,339
When we truly can't afford
to sustain it,

533
00:22:59,339 --> 00:23:00,339
you can tell me by then.

534
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:02,579
Right now.

535
00:23:03,819 --> 00:23:04,699
We're in the red already.

536
00:23:12,459 --> 00:23:13,419
I...

537
00:23:23,179 --> 00:23:24,939
Charge!

538
00:23:26,219 --> 00:23:27,980
That buddy was listless during class.

539
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:28,819
Now that she's outside,

540
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,099
it's like she's on steroids.

541
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:32,059
She can do everything
except for studying.

542
00:23:32,339 --> 00:23:33,740
If so, why did she join
the apprentice class?

543
00:23:34,059 --> 00:23:35,020
Why don't you ask her?

544
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:36,709
Fine.

545
00:23:39,819 --> 00:23:41,579
Tou, I have a question.

546
00:23:42,099 --> 00:23:43,179
Why did you join the apprentice class

547
00:23:43,219 --> 00:23:44,179
when you hate studying?

548
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,540
As the saying goes,
gifts blind the eyes.

549
00:23:46,819 --> 00:23:47,819
He already paid me.

550
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:49,339
I have to study TCM or cook

551
00:23:49,339 --> 00:23:50,339
as long as he wants me to.

552
00:23:50,939 --> 00:23:52,459
So, a cook like you is studying TCM?

553
00:23:52,459 --> 00:23:53,819
That's quite a huge leap.

554
00:23:54,939 --> 00:23:55,819
That's none of your business.

555
00:24:01,459 --> 00:24:02,819
Let me clarify something.

556
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:04,020
Only take what we need.

557
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,740
I won't pay for anything
outside the list.

558
00:24:06,699 --> 00:24:09,219
I can buy snacks with the money
I save, right?

559
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,413
No.

560
00:24:11,299 --> 00:24:12,459
Why not?

561
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:15,540
No means no.

562
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:17,219
It's not like snacks are expensive.

563
00:24:17,219 --> 00:24:18,419
You will only buy the things

564
00:24:18,419 --> 00:24:19,299
that are written on the list.

565
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:20,459
Excuse me.

566
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:21,339
Sorry for the interruption.

567
00:24:21,339 --> 00:24:23,339
I'm running a business nearby.

568
00:24:23,339 --> 00:24:24,500
-Can I...
-No, thanks.

569
00:24:26,419 --> 00:24:27,819
Can I add you on WeChat?

570
00:24:27,819 --> 00:24:30,459
-What kind of business?
-I'm running a nail salon.

571
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:31,993
Sure.

572
00:24:32,219 --> 00:24:33,100
Really?

573
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,560
I added you.

574
00:24:39,579 --> 00:24:40,819
Okay. Thank you.

575
00:24:40,835 --> 00:24:41,707
Don't mention it.

576
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,620
You're really bold, aren't you?

577
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:46,939
Do you know

578
00:24:46,939 --> 00:24:49,699
that she can steal your
personal information, bank details,

579
00:24:49,699 --> 00:24:51,339
and your money from that scan?

580
00:24:51,339 --> 00:24:52,740
You have no safety awareness at all.

581
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,020
What a coincidence.

582
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:56,339
First, there's no money
in my bank account.

583
00:24:56,339 --> 00:24:57,132
Second,

584
00:24:57,419 --> 00:24:58,419
she's cute.

585
00:24:58,819 --> 00:24:59,939
If she tries to take advantage of me,

586
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:02,099
I think it's my gain instead.

587
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:03,363
Am I right?

588
00:25:11,699 --> 00:25:13,059
You were fine just now.

589
00:25:13,219 --> 00:25:14,380
What's wrong? Get up!

590
00:25:14,419 --> 00:25:15,266
My tummy hurts!

591
00:25:17,339 --> 00:25:19,099
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

592
00:25:19,099 --> 00:25:20,780
Miss, is it abdominal pain
or stomach pain?

593
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:21,819
Stomach pain.

594
00:25:21,939 --> 00:25:23,059
I had diarrhoea today.

595
00:25:23,059 --> 00:25:24,059
I didn't have lunch today.

596
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:25,540
This is a case of Tai Yin disease.

597
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,365
What disease?

598
00:25:26,579 --> 00:25:28,219
-Tai Yin disease.
-Are you on your period?

599
00:25:29,179 --> 00:25:30,299
Do you take

600
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:31,219
cold food and drinks usually?

601
00:25:31,219 --> 00:25:32,059
Should we call an ambulance?

602
00:25:32,059 --> 00:25:32,860
Wait.

603
00:25:33,339 --> 00:25:34,540
I think she's on her period.
She forgot to have lunch too.

604
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,397
That's why her blood sugar level is low.

605
00:25:35,939 --> 00:25:37,380
-Should we call 120?
-What's the matter?

606
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:39,140
Should we call an ambulance?

607
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:40,579
Can you get me some brown sugar water?

608
00:25:40,579 --> 00:25:41,459
She might be suffering from
hypoglycaemia.

609
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,620
Who are you guys?

610
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,699
We're doctors.

611
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,902
(Xu Meng)

612
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:06,937
Shan Dao.

613
00:26:07,179 --> 00:26:08,044
(Senior.)

614
00:26:08,459 --> 00:26:09,419
(Do you intend to bring the kids)

615
00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:11,219
(to Mount Huafeng during
Qingming Festival?)

616
00:26:11,219 --> 00:26:12,339
(Do you lack anything?)

617
00:26:12,339 --> 00:26:13,459
Nope.

618
00:26:13,579 --> 00:26:14,740
Ling Lan will prepare everything.

619
00:26:14,939 --> 00:26:15,780
Are you going?

620
00:26:16,459 --> 00:26:17,540
I have several meetings to attend.

621
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:18,579
Let's see how it goes.

622
00:26:18,579 --> 00:26:21,699
However, I checked the weather forecast.

623
00:26:21,699 --> 00:26:23,459
(It would be raining on those few days.)

624
00:26:23,459 --> 00:26:25,780
You have to prepare
some raincoats and boots.

625
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,900
The road condition there is terrible.

626
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,059
Great suggestion.

627
00:26:29,059 --> 00:26:30,260
I'll tell Ling Lan about it.

628
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,860
Say, is Ling Lan beside you?

629
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,660
Nope. She's busy with something else.

630
00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:37,939
I called you

631
00:26:38,339 --> 00:26:41,699
because I have something important
to tell you.

632
00:26:42,099 --> 00:26:43,099
What is it? Speak up.

633
00:26:43,579 --> 00:26:46,339
(Don't you want to take a walk with me?)

634
00:26:50,699 --> 00:26:51,667
Is it something huge?

635
00:26:56,939 --> 00:26:57,812
Ren.

636
00:26:59,219 --> 00:27:00,699
What is it?

637
00:27:00,699 --> 00:27:01,819
You're being so mysterious.

638
00:27:02,459 --> 00:27:04,059
It's about Little Lark.

639
00:27:04,579 --> 00:27:05,500
What a coincidence.

640
00:27:06,099 --> 00:27:07,260
When I was performing outpatient duty,

641
00:27:07,299 --> 00:27:08,660
I encountered an outlander patient.

642
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:11,059
He said a divine healer
went to their place.

643
00:27:11,219 --> 00:27:12,579
And, that divine healer was the one

644
00:27:12,819 --> 00:27:14,540
who recommended him to our hospital.

645
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:17,339
What has this got to do
with Little Lark?

646
00:27:18,579 --> 00:27:21,459
My guess is that the divine healer
is Little Lark herself.

647
00:27:24,299 --> 00:27:27,419
I've already inquired about her looks
and age.

648
00:27:27,459 --> 00:27:28,339
It's pretty close.

649
00:27:28,339 --> 00:27:30,140
And, according to what the patient said,

650
00:27:30,179 --> 00:27:31,740
she received professional training

651
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,579
for her career.

652
00:27:34,939 --> 00:27:35,900
She's not a casual practitioner.

653
00:27:36,339 --> 00:27:38,579
There's one more thing
that makes it more interesting.

654
00:27:39,219 --> 00:27:40,980
That divine healer is staying on

655
00:27:41,579 --> 00:27:43,660
Mount Huafeng's hillside.

656
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,179
That's why I dare to assume

657
00:27:47,586 --> 00:27:49,946
that the divine healer
is Little Lark herself.

658
00:27:50,939 --> 00:27:53,579
I think she still misses you.

659
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:57,860
And, she knows that you'll visit
that place every year.

660
00:28:10,819 --> 00:28:11,747
What do you think?

661
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,140
You must be tempted.

662
00:28:26,299 --> 00:28:27,259
Listen.

663
00:28:27,579 --> 00:28:29,339
Add some yogurt to it later.

664
00:28:29,339 --> 00:28:30,140
It'll taste better.

665
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:31,403
Got it?

666
00:28:32,219 --> 00:28:33,179
Tou,

667
00:28:33,219 --> 00:28:35,059
you're truly a culinary expert indeed.

668
00:28:37,459 --> 00:28:38,299
I plan

669
00:28:38,459 --> 00:28:39,459
to make this fruit salad

670
00:28:39,459 --> 00:28:40,579
as nice as possible.

671
00:28:41,459 --> 00:28:42,419
We can use it to curry favour

672
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:43,299
with the elite student.

673
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,459
I'll try to make her

674
00:28:45,459 --> 00:28:46,500
share her notes

675
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:47,404
with us.

676
00:29:06,219 --> 00:29:07,115
Rebecca,

677
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:08,419
are you done with your workout?

678
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:09,644
Good job.

679
00:29:10,099 --> 00:29:11,540
I prepared some delicious

680
00:29:11,819 --> 00:29:13,459
fruit salad for you.

681
00:29:13,459 --> 00:29:14,363
Here you go.

682
00:29:15,219 --> 00:29:16,059
I'm on a diet.

683
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,419
I used sugar-free yogurt.

684
00:29:23,419 --> 00:29:25,299
It won't affect your diet.

685
00:29:25,419 --> 00:29:26,292
Here.

686
00:29:28,699 --> 00:29:29,939
I don't take fruits.

687
00:29:32,819 --> 00:29:34,219
That's pretty unique.

688
00:29:34,219 --> 00:29:35,260
I'll remember that.

689
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:37,059
Your notes are very complete.

690
00:29:37,699 --> 00:29:40,059
Lawyers are detailed
and meticulous indeed.

691
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,104
What about this?

692
00:29:41,299 --> 00:29:42,219
Why don't you share your notes

693
00:29:42,459 --> 00:29:44,219
with the rest of the class?

694
00:29:44,459 --> 00:29:45,316
Why should I?

695
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,219
So that we can identify the leaks
and improve together.

696
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,288
No.

697
00:29:48,459 --> 00:29:49,740
I paid attention in class

698
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:50,860
and worked hard to jot down the notes.

699
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:51,819
You guys didn't.

700
00:29:51,819 --> 00:29:53,179
What gives you guys the right

701
00:29:53,179 --> 00:29:54,099
to enjoy the fruit of my labour?

702
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:56,339
You're acting like
my primary school deskmate.

703
00:29:56,819 --> 00:29:58,339
It's not like there's
a bottom-out system in place.

704
00:29:58,459 --> 00:29:59,459
What's wrong with sharing your notes?

705
00:29:59,459 --> 00:30:00,860
Although that's the case,

706
00:30:01,059 --> 00:30:02,459
there's a difference between
elites like me and you all.

707
00:30:02,939 --> 00:30:03,740
Since I worked hard on it,

708
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,740
that means I'm capable

709
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:05,699
and I'm the better one.

710
00:30:05,699 --> 00:30:07,819
Anyway, it's unfair for lazy
people and hard-working people

711
00:30:07,819 --> 00:30:09,740
to achieve the same result.

712
00:30:11,099 --> 00:30:12,459
My goodness.

713
00:30:13,459 --> 00:30:14,419
So, you think you won't need

714
00:30:14,419 --> 00:30:16,099
other people's help
for the rest of your life?

715
00:30:18,699 --> 00:30:19,619
Fine.

716
00:30:21,052 --> 00:30:21,972
Fine.

717
00:30:29,819 --> 00:30:30,763
This is great.

718
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:48,579
Where did you go?

719
00:30:50,059 --> 00:30:50,916
I went to take a walk.

720
00:30:51,219 --> 00:30:52,660
Why didn't you invite me?

721
00:30:53,459 --> 00:30:54,380
We should've gone there together.

722
00:30:54,579 --> 00:30:56,419
You could take your walk
while I could practice boxing.

723
00:31:00,099 --> 00:31:01,083
Sun Tou Tou,

724
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:02,579
where's my blanched kale?

725
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:04,699
It's outside.

726
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:06,419
I told you before.

727
00:31:06,419 --> 00:31:07,699
I only take blanched kale.

728
00:31:08,059 --> 00:31:08,924
You see,

729
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:10,699
kale is pretty bitter.

730
00:31:10,699 --> 00:31:13,459
It'll taste better if you add
some minced meat and garlic.

731
00:31:20,459 --> 00:31:21,740
Roubecca, you're something else.

732
00:31:22,059 --> 00:31:23,419
You only take cucumbers?

733
00:31:23,419 --> 00:31:24,540
Do you think you're a rabbit?

734
00:31:29,419 --> 00:31:30,579
Look at all these dishes.

735
00:31:31,099 --> 00:31:32,020
Coming.

736
00:31:33,579 --> 00:31:35,339
This is the last dish.

737
00:31:35,339 --> 00:31:37,219
Tou Tou, did you make all of them?

738
00:31:37,219 --> 00:31:38,419
Of course.

739
00:31:38,699 --> 00:31:39,740
Not bad at all.

740
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,554
Nephew,

741
00:31:40,579 --> 00:31:42,339
try the Shredded Pork with Garlic Sauce
you ordered.

742
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,579
Try it. Are you doing face reading here?

743
00:31:59,939 --> 00:32:00,788
It's pretty good.

744
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:03,132
That's it?

745
00:32:03,459 --> 00:32:04,315
Yeah.

746
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:05,693
Tou Tou.

747
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,140
When Mr Ren says

748
00:32:07,299 --> 00:32:09,179
"pretty good", that's the best remark

749
00:32:09,299 --> 00:32:10,740
you can get from him.

750
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:11,860
Is that so?

751
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,980
He had me for a second.
I thought it wasn't good.

752
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,419
Everyone, eat up.

753
00:32:15,459 --> 00:32:16,660
-You compliment people like that?
-Let's dig in.

754
00:32:16,699 --> 00:32:17,657
Try my cooking.

755
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:35,380
By the way, Niece-in-law,

756
00:32:35,459 --> 00:32:36,329
Nephew,

757
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:38,540
we met a girl in the supermarket today.

758
00:32:38,699 --> 00:32:40,099
Her tummy was aching so badly

759
00:32:40,099 --> 00:32:41,419
that she couldn't straighten her back.

760
00:32:41,579 --> 00:32:43,179
This kid went to her

761
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,584
and gave her two needles.

762
00:32:45,572 --> 00:32:46,412
She recovered immediately.

763
00:32:46,939 --> 00:32:47,819
He was amazing.

764
00:32:47,819 --> 00:32:49,339
I do believe in the power of acupuncture
after today.

765
00:32:49,579 --> 00:32:50,467
Is that so?

766
00:32:51,077 --> 00:32:51,960
Son,

767
00:32:52,059 --> 00:32:53,500
tell us about your glorious history.

768
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:55,219
Mum, don't listen to her.

769
00:32:55,339 --> 00:32:56,419
You're being modest now?

770
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,339
Madam Song, it's like this.

771
00:32:57,339 --> 00:32:59,099
I read the pulse of that girl.

772
00:32:59,459 --> 00:33:00,579
According to the pulse reading

773
00:33:00,579 --> 00:33:01,780
and the fact that she had diarrhoea,

774
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,219
I deduced that it was a case
of Tai Yin disease.

775
00:33:03,699 --> 00:33:04,860
Tian Zhen and Shi Yan thought

776
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:05,939
that she felt giddy

777
00:33:06,299 --> 00:33:07,740
due to hypoglycaemia
as she didn't eat the entire day.

778
00:33:08,699 --> 00:33:10,699
I assumed that she was
going to have her period soon.

779
00:33:11,339 --> 00:33:12,699
How did you treat her then?

780
00:33:13,179 --> 00:33:15,059
I targeted her thenar muscle,
Nei Guan Meridian, and He Gu Meridian.

781
00:33:15,339 --> 00:33:16,939
She was fine when
I read her pulse again.

782
00:33:17,059 --> 00:33:17,860
I assume that she recovered.

783
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,179
That was mystical.

784
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:21,699
She recovered immediately

785
00:33:22,219 --> 00:33:24,540
after getting pricked by needles.

786
00:33:24,579 --> 00:33:26,419
I'm serious. It worked immediately.

787
00:33:30,579 --> 00:33:31,740
Where is she now?

788
00:33:35,219 --> 00:33:36,099
I don't know.

789
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,194
She looked fine to me.

790
00:33:37,219 --> 00:33:38,740
We didn't keep her contact number.

791
00:33:38,939 --> 00:33:39,740
None of you kept it?

792
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:40,914
Nope.

793
00:33:43,579 --> 00:33:44,459
Hurry and look for her!

794
00:33:47,179 --> 00:33:48,059
Where can we find her?

795
00:33:49,059 --> 00:33:50,339
I know!

796
00:33:51,219 --> 00:33:53,459
She can be found at the alley
behind the supermarket.

797
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:54,660
No. 7, Zimu Street.

798
00:33:56,219 --> 00:33:58,059
I'll send her contact number
to you guys through the group chat.

799
00:33:58,980 --> 00:33:59,853
Wait!

800
00:34:00,459 --> 00:34:01,459
You guys are done with lunch?

801
00:34:01,459 --> 00:34:02,363
Tou,

802
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,579
how did you know her address?

803
00:34:06,339 --> 00:34:07,299
I scanned the QR code for her profile.

804
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:19,780
Do you want some water?

805
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:25,797
Dad.

806
00:34:26,299 --> 00:34:27,164
Mum.

807
00:34:27,419 --> 00:34:28,299
She's fine now.

808
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:31,299
She just underwent
a unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.

809
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,020
You started reading pulse
when you were four.

810
00:34:47,579 --> 00:34:48,500
You started studying TCM under me
when you were seven.

811
00:34:49,059 --> 00:34:49,980
You studied under me for 20 years.

812
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:51,980
20 years, you know?

813
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:52,980
What exactly

814
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,860
did you learn?

815
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,388
Mr Ren,

816
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,419
we couldn't tell too.

817
00:35:03,419 --> 00:35:04,860
That girl was so young.

818
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:05,860
Who would've expected her
to have eccyesis?

819
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:06,812
I wasn't talking to you.

820
00:35:09,339 --> 00:35:10,459
If we didn't manage

821
00:35:10,459 --> 00:35:11,500
to save the girl today,

822
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:14,459
you would've killed her
with a license in your hand!

823
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,428
Li Quan.

824
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:24,860
You should head back first.

825
00:35:40,459 --> 00:35:42,579
This should be the one.

826
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:51,905
Roubecca,

827
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,379
you do have a unique preference
for dolls, huh?

828
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,735
No.

829
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,020
That's not the Tai Yin Meridian.

830
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:02,720
This is Tai Yin Meridian.

831
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:03,780
That's not true.

832
00:36:03,939 --> 00:36:05,100
My nephew said

833
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,179
that the area is Yang
if it's facing the sunlight.

834
00:36:07,179 --> 00:36:08,740
It's Yin when the sunlight
can't get to it.

835
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:10,500
Look at your own elbows. They're tanned.

836
00:36:10,563 --> 00:36:12,043
That's why the Tai Yin Meridian
isn't located there.

837
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,939
Weren't you sleeping during class?

838
00:36:19,939 --> 00:36:21,020
I was just absorbed.

839
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:24,740
Elite student, huh?

840
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,419
You're just good at memorizing things.

841
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,699
Don't touch it.

842
00:36:29,699 --> 00:36:30,500
Fine.

843
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,179
I won't touch it.

844
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,459
Is this your Jigglypuff?

845
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,179
This is the doll I use to learn

846
00:36:38,179 --> 00:36:39,100
meridians and acupressure points.

847
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,780
Jigglypuff is for kids.

848
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,780
You even prepared this as well?

849
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:46,419
I, Rebecca,
never fight a battle unprepared.

850
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:47,977
Amazing.

851
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,576
You do live up to your name
as an elite student.

852
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,236
Lend it to me.

853
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,459
This is my learning tool.

854
00:36:54,459 --> 00:36:55,580
If you want one,

855
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:57,260
you can buy it online.

856
00:36:58,260 --> 00:36:59,780
You're so petty.

857
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,219
Fine, I'll buy one myself.

858
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,179
What's the name of this product?

859
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:08,780
Is it rubber doll?

860
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:13,740
After that, find the elbow.

861
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:18,419
Starting from here, three, four, five.

862
00:37:26,939 --> 00:37:28,020
You went overboard today.

863
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:30,653
Get up.

864
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,020
Get up.

865
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:38,699
Are you saying that
I've criticized your son too harshly?

866
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,179
Just look at your son.

867
00:37:42,699 --> 00:37:43,980
He's fine.

868
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:44,972
But you?

869
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:47,020
If it weren't for Tou Tou

870
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:48,260
and us,

871
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,379
I assume

872
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:52,780
that girl would've been gone.

873
00:37:56,699 --> 00:37:58,179
I think

874
00:37:58,179 --> 00:37:59,300
that's understandable.

875
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:02,419
Think about it. Our son just received
his medical license.

876
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:04,820
And he's not an official doctor yet.

877
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:05,653
They just

878
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,260
met a person who was
in need of assistance

879
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,580
in the supermarket.

880
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:10,480
Besides, Peng Shi Yan was around too.

881
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,179
Peng Shi Yan studies Western medicine.

882
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:13,500
He has a different medical speciality.

883
00:38:13,699 --> 00:38:14,740
He's in the Department of Paediatrics.

884
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:16,340
It's understandable for him to
have no idea what to do.

885
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:17,139
But our son comes from a family of

886
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:20,060
TCM practitioners and specialises
in obstetrics and paediatrics.

887
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,740
How could he not know what to do?
That doesn't make sense!

888
00:38:27,939 --> 00:38:29,060
Your son was right.

889
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:31,699
We shouldn't have forced him
to study TCM.

890
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:32,740
This kid

891
00:38:34,419 --> 00:38:35,580
isn't cut out for this field.

892
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:41,419
Have you not committed a mistake before?

893
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,820
Did you forget what happened
to Master Chen Fu?

894
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:50,260
As doctors,

895
00:38:51,179 --> 00:38:54,340
we grow alongside
the life and death of patients.

896
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,820
It may sound cruel,

897
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:57,179
but that's the truth.

898
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:59,300
Your son is only 26 years old this year.

899
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:01,780
How old are you?

900
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,540
You used the term "kill".

901
00:39:06,659 --> 00:39:07,780
That was pretty harsh of you.

902
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,020
Aren't you afraid
that it'll ruin his confidence

903
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:11,500
in practising medicine?

904
00:39:11,939 --> 00:39:13,980
Confidence?

905
00:39:14,859 --> 00:39:16,300
Confidence, my foot.

906
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:19,540
He's just a snowflake.

907
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,859
You dote on your son.

908
00:39:23,179 --> 00:39:25,100
His grandparents dote on him.

909
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,659
All of our relatives dote on him.

910
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,300
You guys will clean up his mess

911
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,179
when he commits mistakes.

912
00:39:31,179 --> 00:39:34,060
You're doing it to look after
that fragile dignity of his.

913
00:39:37,179 --> 00:39:38,500
In front of a patient's life,

914
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,340
confidence and dignity

915
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:41,179
mean nothing.

916
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:45,419
You don't care about him usually.

917
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:47,939
You only reprimand him
when he makes a mistake.

918
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:50,459
What gives us the right
to be his parents then?

919
00:39:50,699 --> 00:39:51,659
As parents,

920
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,219
don't you think we should
be responsible for our child?

921
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,500
Sun Tou Tou doesn't have parents.

922
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,300
Who'll be responsible for her then?

923
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:06,125
Being responsible, huh?

924
00:40:06,699 --> 00:40:08,500
We should always be responsible
for our own actions.

925
00:40:09,419 --> 00:40:10,260
Come and practice your writing.

926
00:40:14,859 --> 00:40:15,859
No, I won't.

927
00:40:16,659 --> 00:40:18,100
Do you think I can practice
my writing nonchalantly

928
00:40:18,459 --> 00:40:19,260
like you

929
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:21,260
after reprimanding our son?

930
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:23,659
Listen.

931
00:40:24,219 --> 00:40:25,500
I still haven't improved
after all these years

932
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,820
all because of you.
You make me angry all the time.

933
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:28,459
After I get angry,

934
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,001
I have to take my time

935
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:31,580
to digest my emotions.

936
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,149
That's absurd.

937
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:40,740
What's absurd?

938
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,280
The ink hasn't been ground yet.

939
00:40:58,540 --> 00:40:59,444
Tian Zhen,

940
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,020
your father must've reprimanded you.

941
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:04,260
This isn't entirely your fault.

942
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:05,260
We're at fault too.

943
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,780
There's a bad thing about
Western medicine.

944
00:41:08,419 --> 00:41:09,580
Our specialities are way too different
from each other.

945
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,459
I...

946
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:14,780
I can't do anything

947
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,179
when it comes to O&G issues.

948
00:41:16,939 --> 00:41:17,780
Speaking of which,

949
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:19,580
you TCM practitioners
are much better than us.

950
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:21,300
You have to know every
worldly knowledge there is.

951
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:22,740
And, you have to be familiar
with all kinds of diseases.

952
00:41:23,419 --> 00:41:24,699
You guys are just like deities.

953
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:25,885
Your parents

954
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,419
are amazing figures indeed.

955
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:29,980
At first, I did suspect it.

956
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,699
I should've told that girl

957
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:34,300
to get a check-up in the hospital.

958
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:35,939
It's all because of Tou Tou.

959
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:37,340
Besides,

960
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:38,580
that girl

961
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:39,939
looked like a decent girl.

962
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:42,419
Who has rubber dolls?

963
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:54,580
We can talk about the dolls next time.

964
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:57,939
See what you would like to eat.

965
00:41:59,020 --> 00:41:59,859
This is tomorrow's menu.

966
00:42:02,179 --> 00:42:03,260
Is there anything you want to have?

967
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:14,699
What's wrong?

968
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:17,219
Did that girl die?

969
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,141
Nonsense.

970
00:42:18,219 --> 00:42:19,109
Stop jinxing it.

971
00:42:19,139 --> 00:42:19,980
We saved her.

972
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:21,939
You had me for a second there.

973
00:42:21,939 --> 00:42:23,179
What's with the long face then?

974
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:25,859
One of her Fallopian tubes was removed.

975
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:31,179
How many Fallopian tubes
does a woman have?

976
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,360
Two.

977
00:42:32,419 --> 00:42:33,540
That means she has one left, right?

978
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,521
That's fine, right?

979
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:38,419
What illness does she have?

980
00:42:38,419 --> 00:42:40,859
My nephew and niece-in-law
were quite nervous about it.

981
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:42,780
It's eccyesis.

982
00:42:43,939 --> 00:42:44,859
Eccyesis?

983
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,169
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

984
00:42:49,293 --> 00:42:50,721
(are referenced from relevant
traditional Chinese medicine books)

985
00:42:50,793 --> 00:42:52,562
