1
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,719
You applied for the National Health Fund.

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:08,516
But now, you're building buildings
for R&D of decoction pieces.

3
00:00:09,019 --> 00:00:10,777
And, you're just building them
without any of the R&D.

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,382
It doesn't fit the description
of projects that we support.

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,737
Sir, I've told you before.

6
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,900
This is the incubation centre
of TCM herbs.

7
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:21,100
It's just a tiny part
of our industrial park.

8
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,859
Sir, look at the opposite building.

9
00:00:25,139 --> 00:00:26,313
We're preparing to bring in

10
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,699
a first-class
physical examination centre,

11
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:30,164
which is a listed company too.

12
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,937
The Grade A tertiary hospitals
will move here within five years.

13
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:34,656
The preventative treatments
and recovery processes

14
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:35,897
will be done in our centre

15
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,589
after the Grade A tertiary hospitals.

16
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,080
Sir,

17
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,899
this is our plan for national health.

18
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:43,920
Mr Liu,

19
00:00:44,099 --> 00:00:47,056
you're talking about five years
from now, or even ten years from now.

20
00:00:47,259 --> 00:00:49,216
Everyone can achieve something
after getting an investment.

21
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,016
However, we only have
so much money right now

22
00:00:51,099 --> 00:00:54,143
and we have to invest in someone
whose business is already established.

23
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:57,540
This is just an empty industrial factory.

24
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:59,424
Where is your sincerity?

25
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,557
Chief Secretary,

26
00:01:03,643 --> 00:01:04,643
Director,

27
00:01:05,619 --> 00:01:06,740
do you guys know

28
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,020
Ren Xin Zheng?

29
00:01:08,259 --> 00:01:09,517
Professor Ren of the University of TCM?

30
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,600
That's right.

31
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,380
Of course I know him.

32
00:01:12,899 --> 00:01:14,340
My father always went to him

33
00:01:14,539 --> 00:01:15,539
whenever he was sick.

34
00:01:16,539 --> 00:01:17,577
Professor Ren

35
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,179
is just like the banner
of Jiangzhou City.

36
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,216
He's well-known throughout the country.

37
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:23,499
That's right.

38
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,179
Professor Ren is the biggest sincerity
we can show.

39
00:01:31,539 --> 00:01:32,780
In the healthcare industry,

40
00:01:33,179 --> 00:01:35,740
nurturing talent is a main element.

41
00:01:36,259 --> 00:01:38,617
To nurture talents,
we must have good education.

42
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,980
Both of you should know this.

43
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,736
As long as Professor Ren is here,

44
00:01:42,819 --> 00:01:45,420
he has a set of complete
education blueprint.

45
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:46,939
Once he opens his academy,

46
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,377
and he pumps out those talents,

47
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,456
the healthcare industry park

48
00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:52,579
will have nothing to worry about.

49
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,060
Is he here?

50
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:56,259
That's right.

51
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,577
He already resigned from his post.

52
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,299
He's here to support my business.

53
00:01:59,899 --> 00:02:01,017
He and his students

54
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,700
are living on my property right now.

55
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,740
I guess I found him by chance, huh?

56
00:02:06,179 --> 00:02:07,176
My father

57
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:09,176
was just complaining that Professor Ren

58
00:02:09,259 --> 00:02:10,825
had stopped giving people diagnoses.

59
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,576
His nameplate was also removed from

60
00:02:13,659 --> 00:02:16,217
the TCM affiliated hospital's
Department of Internal Medicine.

61
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,659
I didn't expect to find him here.

62
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Let's go.

63
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:21,376
Let's visit Professor Ren.

64
00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:22,459
Please.

65
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,217
I'm afraid this will be a busy place

66
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,539
in the future.

67
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:48,980
Professor Ren.

68
00:02:49,404 --> 00:02:51,217
-Look who's here.
-Professor Ren.

69
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,497
Congratulations on the opening
of your apprentice class.

70
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,580
Thank you.

71
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,420
Professor Ren,

72
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,667
do you still remember me?

73
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,659
I can't remember faces well.

74
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,140
I'm sure you remember my father then.

75
00:03:04,659 --> 00:03:07,580
It's Mr Cao, who always
had tinnitus issues.

76
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:08,819
Cao Fang Hua.

77
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,019
You cured his tinnitus.

78
00:03:11,179 --> 00:03:14,300
I accompanied my father to see you
several times.

79
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:15,500
I see.

80
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,700
You see,

81
00:03:17,259 --> 00:03:19,217
I had examined too many patients.

82
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,337
That's why I...

83
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,539
I understand.

84
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:23,899
Among the projects

85
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,140
that the government will support,

86
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,897
they'll allocate a significant portion

87
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,176
for education purposes.

88
00:03:29,259 --> 00:03:30,897
Professor Ren, you can apply
for government subsidy

89
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,860
for the apprentice class you're holding.

90
00:03:33,259 --> 00:03:34,259
That's right.

91
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,617
That's why we invited Director Xia

92
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,777
and Chief Secretary Cao
from the National Health Fund.

93
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,220
Let's see if there's a way for us
to cooperate.

94
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,638
I've already applied for it.

95
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,700
But it wasn't approved.

96
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,060
That's why I'm doing it right now.

97
00:03:48,539 --> 00:03:49,897
You're highly revered.

98
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,685
-They'll surely approve it.
-Yes.

99
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,819
Professor Ren, can you tell us
about the planning

100
00:03:55,099 --> 00:03:56,230
for your apprentice class?

101
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:57,700
There's no planning.

102
00:03:58,259 --> 00:03:59,694
I'm taking it one step at a time.

103
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:03,617
The passing down of TCM culture
halted for many years.

104
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,096
That's why I'm figuring things out
as I go.

105
00:04:05,179 --> 00:04:06,614
I'm taking it one step at a time.

106
00:04:08,259 --> 00:04:10,656
Professor Ren's biggest flaw is modesty.

107
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:12,617
He has been in the TCM field
his entire life.

108
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,897
He educates people and
provides diagnosis.

109
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,456
That's why he already has
a well-thought-out strategy.

110
00:04:16,539 --> 00:04:18,460
That's not it.
Not at all.

111
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,789
It will never work without
the help of superiors like you two.

112
00:04:21,872 --> 00:04:22,872
What about this?

113
00:04:23,099 --> 00:04:24,657
There's no time like the present.

114
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,700
Let's request the professor
to read our pulse.

115
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:27,897
-Sure.
-Sure.

116
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:28,980
Not today.

117
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,657
I have a class to teach.

118
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,416
You guys can come again

119
00:04:33,499 --> 00:04:34,777
when I'm not teaching.

120
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,099
We might not have time next time.

121
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,980
If you have needs,

122
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,059
you'll make time for it.

123
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,657
This is...

124
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,777
If so,

125
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,339
we should not trouble him.

126
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,296
I'm sure you two are perfectly healthy.

127
00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:48,456
Just read our pulse for fun.

128
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:49,740
For fun, okay? Come on.

129
00:04:50,539 --> 00:04:51,980
I won't see you guys off then.

130
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,939
You guys are welcome

131
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:55,898
to attend my lesson.

132
00:04:55,981 --> 00:04:58,217
Maybe you can put
what you learned to use in the future.

133
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,099
What lesson will you be teaching today?

134
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,290
Cerebral infarction, heart attack,
epilepsy,

135
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,777
Yang depletion syndrome, and so on.

136
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,991
I'll talk about TCM first-aid
for such situations.

137
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,780
Before we talk about TCM first-aid,

138
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,019
I would like to ask you guys this.

139
00:05:16,299 --> 00:05:18,459
What are the "eyes"
for TCM practitioners?

140
00:05:19,579 --> 00:05:20,579
Anyone?

141
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:22,817
Yin and Yang.

142
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:23,900
That's right.

143
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,340
Yin and Yang.

144
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,631
So, how can we differentiate
between Yin and Yang?

145
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,859
Oh no, we're studying metaphysics again.

146
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,964
This is not metaphysics.

147
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,674
It's easy to identify them.

148
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:42,220
Before we learned how to stand and walk,

149
00:05:42,459 --> 00:05:43,459
we had to crawl.

150
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:48,940
The area where your back faces
the sunlight is known as Yang.

151
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,259
Yin is the area
where it faces the ground.

152
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,100
There are three Yangs and three Yins
in the human body.

153
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,100
Tai Yang, Shao Yang, and Yang Ming.

154
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,500
Tai Yin, Jue Yin, and Shao Yin.

155
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,820
They have an interconnected relationship.

156
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,936
So, what does the term
"interconnected" mean?

157
00:06:06,019 --> 00:06:07,150
Outsiders will be confused

158
00:06:08,019 --> 00:06:09,063
when they hear the term.

159
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,500
Actually,

160
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,380
it's very simple.

161
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:13,739
Guys, take a look.

162
00:06:14,739 --> 00:06:16,780
This is the surface.

163
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,019
On the other side,

164
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,340
this is the interior.

165
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,109
Yang Ming Meridian is on the surface.

166
00:06:25,299 --> 00:06:26,780
Tai Yin Meridian is inside.

167
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,220
Shao Yang Meridian is on the surface.

168
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:32,220
On the contrary,
Jue Yin Meridian is inside.

169
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,859
Tai Yang Meridian is on the surface.

170
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,579
Shao Yin Meridian

171
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
is inside.

172
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,859
It's very convenient to know this.

173
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,340
Understood?

174
00:06:51,299 --> 00:06:52,299
Tou Tou.

175
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,040
Tou Tou!

176
00:06:54,179 --> 00:06:55,179
Is it lunchtime?

177
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,340
It's not lunchtime.

178
00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:00,259
It's not time yet.

179
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,220
Guys, stop laughing.

180
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,900
Tou Tou's able to sit here

181
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:06,859
and focus so deeply

182
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,540
that she fell asleep.

183
00:07:11,019 --> 00:07:12,780
The Chinese language

184
00:07:14,019 --> 00:07:15,380
is deep and complex.

185
00:07:15,859 --> 00:07:18,496
There are two parts to the human body.

186
00:07:18,579 --> 00:07:20,232
First, it's "Xing", which means shape.

187
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,987
Second, it's "Shen",
which means spirit or focus.

188
00:07:23,419 --> 00:07:24,817
I realised something.

189
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,579
Although some of you
are in this classroom,

190
00:07:29,259 --> 00:07:31,820
your focus isn't here.

191
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:34,100
You're scrolling your phone instead.

192
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:36,259
I think Tou Tou is better than you.

193
00:07:36,459 --> 00:07:38,340
At least Tou Tou's so focused

194
00:07:38,579 --> 00:07:39,577
that she fell asleep.

195
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,417
I truly hope you guys

196
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,540
can cherish our class.

197
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:46,023
If you don't feel like listening,
you can sleep.

198
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:51,056
Sleeping leads to revitalization.

199
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:53,577
Revitalization leads to enlightenment,

200
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,017
and enlightenment leads to awakening.

201
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:59,340
I think sleeping is better
than scrolling one's phone.

202
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,660
Maybe

203
00:08:02,259 --> 00:08:04,699
an enlightened one will
be born in our class

204
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,220
after sleeping.

205
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,680
Go ahead.

206
00:08:11,179 --> 00:08:12,440
I need to head to the toilet.

207
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:23,979
Go ahead.

208
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,143
(Passing down of TCM)

209
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,259
Why aren't they back yet?

210
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,579
Do you know how long I've been waiting?

211
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,459
Aren't you guys hungry?

212
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,660
Handsome,

213
00:09:03,139 --> 00:09:04,697
stop pulling a long face.

214
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,139
It's bad for your health

215
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,845
if you keep sulking like this.

216
00:09:08,259 --> 00:09:09,259
Don't you think so?

217
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,900
Don't act like your father.

218
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,137
Let me ask you something.

219
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,577
Say, will your father make kids cry

220
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,778
when he gives them a diagnosis?
I'm sure he will.

221
00:09:16,861 --> 00:09:18,376
Your mother must've
had it rough if she has

222
00:09:18,459 --> 00:09:19,897
to spend time with him all day long.

223
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,780
I knew there was food!

224
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,780
Calm down.

225
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,139
Tou Tou, it's difficult
to order food for you.

226
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,577
You'll complain about the ingredients,

227
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,660
the cook,

228
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,496
the taste, and the freshness...

229
00:09:37,579 --> 00:09:39,220
Enough already.

230
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,017
Listen. I've made at least
1,000 food deliveries

231
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,257
by now.

232
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,137
I'm not bragging here.

233
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,496
I can tell which restaurants
these orders are from

234
00:09:44,579 --> 00:09:46,577
by just taking a sniff.

235
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,780
The ones I told you to avoid

236
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:51,059
are not that good.
Understood?

237
00:09:53,019 --> 00:09:54,340
Words alone are no proof.

238
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,018
Besides the restaurants you acknowledged,

239
00:09:57,101 --> 00:09:59,017
we've also ordered food from
several restaurants nearby

240
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,100
with the best rating.

241
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,257
Try them out.
If you think they're okay,

242
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,337
we can order them
without any issues in the future.

243
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,420
Try them?

244
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,137
Does that mean I can try all of them?

245
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,220
Of course.

246
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,235
(Sun Tou Tou's Taste Test)

247
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:20,980
I'm ready.

248
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,220
Let's begin.

249
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,633
Use the serving chopsticks.

250
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:28,698
The others can't have the rest

251
00:10:28,781 --> 00:10:29,817
if you try them with your own chopsticks.

252
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,017
You're so annoying.

253
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,660
Why don't you serve me instead?

254
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,619
This must be from Shudaonan.

255
00:10:42,699 --> 00:10:44,300
They mainly serve Sichuan cuisine.

256
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,817
However, in order to accommodate
the taste of Jiangzhou,

257
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,017
it's not sweet or spicy enough.

258
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,405
Don't order from them.
Their quality has deteriorated.

259
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:51,980
Come. Try the next one.

260
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:54,657
You don't need to open it.

261
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,698
I could tell which restaurant it was from
when you brought it in.

262
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,173
This is my favourite restaurant.

263
00:10:58,459 --> 00:11:00,257
Nongjia Cuisine's
Large Intestines with Stinky Tofu.

264
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,340
Look.

265
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,137
They added broad beans and peppercorns.
It smells heavenly!

266
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,697
I was wondering who ordered it.
I knew it was you.

267
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:06,976
Everyone can smell it from
three miles away.

268
00:11:07,059 --> 00:11:07,818
Next one.

269
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:09,100
-Is this mine?
-This one.

270
00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:14,825
Peng Shi Yan, you're something else.

271
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,897
This is from Xiaochun Japanese Cuisine.

272
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,257
You actually ordered such expensive food?

273
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:20,220
Can we afford to have this every day?

274
00:11:20,699 --> 00:11:22,613
You can tell just from
trying their egg roll?

275
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,376
I don't think you're
a food delivery rider.

276
00:11:24,459 --> 00:11:25,459
Give me another piece.

277
00:11:25,699 --> 00:11:27,569
You're more like
a Michelin guide inspector.

278
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,660
Next one.

279
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:48,660
Can you tell or not?

280
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,780
Wait. This tastes strange.

281
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,412
Sauteed alfalfa with rice liquor.

282
00:11:52,495 --> 00:11:54,257
They used a mixture of Erguotou
and rice liquor.

283
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,317
It can only be from the Ginkgo
Restaurant at the junction.

284
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,137
Am I right?

285
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,137
However, this dish is...

286
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:00,257
Both the heat control and texture
are different.

287
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,340
Did they make this?

288
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:03,139
Tou Tou,

289
00:12:03,259 --> 00:12:04,860
you're truly impressive.

290
00:12:05,259 --> 00:12:06,819
They did change their cook.

291
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,817
The chubby cook went
to open his own stall.

292
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,340
The current cook is his student.

293
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,780
I know! It's that skinny guy.

294
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:17,019
He doesn't control the heat well.

295
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,220
Wait.

296
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,257
How could you afford to order food

297
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,340
from a fancy restaurant
like Ginkgo Restaurant?

298
00:12:24,019 --> 00:12:25,579
The lunch box had a hole in it

299
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,337
when the food delivery rider
delivered the food to us last time.

300
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,017
I said it was the work of that rider.

301
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,274
You guys didn't believe me.

302
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:34,503
Do all food delivery riders
have the same habit?

303
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:43,019
Peng Shi Yan, are you out of your mind?

304
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,018
What do you mean by that?

305
00:12:44,101 --> 00:12:45,097
Are you looking down on
food delivery riders?

306
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,376
That's not it.

307
00:12:46,459 --> 00:12:47,459
Listen.

308
00:12:47,699 --> 00:12:49,736
So what if you're a paediatrician?

309
00:12:49,819 --> 00:12:50,777
Do you think you earn a lot of money

310
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:51,900
compared to me?

311
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:53,117
Be careful! Don't slip and fall.

312
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:53,936
Come here!

313
00:12:54,019 --> 00:12:55,257
Do you think you earn a lot?

314
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,757
I'm making much more money than you!

315
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,677
That was heartbreaking.

316
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,176
You shouldn't expose other people's
shortcomings when you curse them.

317
00:12:59,259 --> 00:13:00,259
Tou Tou,

318
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:03,715
did you learn all of these
when you were a food delivery rider?

319
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,897
I had to deliver food every day.

320
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,139
I had no time to learn.

321
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,840
Tou,

322
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,259
I'm impressed.

323
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:15,123
In the future, I'll listen to you
when it comes to food delivery.

324
00:13:21,579 --> 00:13:22,496
Who ordered this?

325
00:13:22,579 --> 00:13:23,753
Why isn't anyone taking it?

326
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,376
Son.

327
00:13:33,459 --> 00:13:34,660
-Mum.
-Niece-in-law,

328
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,627
you're pretty particular.

329
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,577
Illness finds its way in by the mouth.

330
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,497
Trouble issues from the mouth too.

331
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,340
If you control your mouth,

332
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,980
you can survive longer.

333
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,993
Was your mother insulting me just now?

334
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,376
Do you know how disposable dishware

335
00:14:12,459 --> 00:14:13,780
is made?

336
00:14:15,459 --> 00:14:16,936
Do you know all disposable dishware

337
00:14:17,019 --> 00:14:18,660
is bleached with hydrogen peroxide?

338
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,496
Do you know the disposable dishware
you're using

339
00:14:21,579 --> 00:14:22,536
might be expired

340
00:14:22,619 --> 00:14:24,980
and might contain E.coli
and hepatitis virus?

341
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,900
There's mold on your chopsticks.

342
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,499
And, you've swallowed it.

343
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,579
Enough. Stop talking, alright?

344
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,900
Your mother said so herself.

345
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,965
Trouble issues from the mouth.

346
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:41,242
I can survive for two more years
if you just keep it to yourself.

347
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,259
She behaves like a hooligan.

348
00:14:48,259 --> 00:14:50,059
Let's not bring them here tomorrow.

349
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:51,579
We should be like them.

350
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,111
It's unhygienic, you know?

351
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:57,427
Pathogenic factors cannot invade the
body with enough healthy qi inside.

352
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,860
I can tell

353
00:15:01,459 --> 00:15:03,017
that you're a prince at home.

354
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,496
You've never endured any hardships.

355
00:15:04,579 --> 00:15:06,180
You even eat like a prince.

356
00:15:07,579 --> 00:15:08,777
You'll starve to death
if you eat like that.

357
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,496
You have to eat quickly.

358
00:15:10,579 --> 00:15:12,019
Only then, you'll get full.

359
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,616
I can share your food with you

360
00:15:16,699 --> 00:15:17,780
if you can't finish it.

361
00:15:31,499 --> 00:15:32,499
Look at how she eats.

362
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,740
Tou Tou,

363
00:15:41,259 --> 00:15:42,540
are you not full yet?

364
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,257
Look, I separated them.

365
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,379
If you don't mind,

366
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,740
you can have my share.

367
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I'm coming!

368
00:15:56,302 --> 00:15:57,056
Thank you, my nephew.

369
00:15:57,139 --> 00:15:59,097
In ancient times, there was
an ancient beast called Taotie.

370
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,296
Its mouth was larger than its gills.

371
00:16:00,379 --> 00:16:01,557
It could swallow everything in one bite.

372
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,897
In the past, I used to think
that it was a male beast,

373
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,540
until I encountered Tou Tou.

374
00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:08,531
Do you know that all villains die
from talking too much?

375
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,120
Guys,

376
00:16:14,499 --> 00:16:16,376
I've helped you guys
to test all the food today.

377
00:16:16,459 --> 00:16:18,697
I think the best is
Xiaochun Japanese Cuisine.

378
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,337
I have no issues having them

379
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,056
every day.

380
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:24,357
-What do you guys think?
-You're too broke for that.

381
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:26,137
Wait, you...

382
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,176
Why must you act like this?

383
00:16:27,259 --> 00:16:28,376
You say you have no money
when we're having nice food.

384
00:16:28,459 --> 00:16:29,817
You say the ingredients aren't fresh
when we order cheap food.

385
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,416
What? You want everyone to starve?

386
00:16:31,499 --> 00:16:33,282
Let's choose the most cost-effective one.

387
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:36,001
Luckily, they didn't use
gutter oil in their cooking.

388
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:37,536
I'm fine with
the inferior food ingredients.

389
00:16:37,619 --> 00:16:38,577
I agree.

390
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:40,217
All take-out food is the same nowadays.

391
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,817
It's not like you can go into
their kitchen and instruct them.

392
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,137
I'm fine as long as it can fill my tummy.

393
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,376
This place is too remote.

394
00:16:44,459 --> 00:16:46,017
We're lucky that we can order
food delivery here.

395
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,100
We should be grateful that
we have food to eat.

396
00:16:48,379 --> 00:16:49,416
This won't do!

397
00:16:49,499 --> 00:16:51,536
Why are we spending money on it
when we know that it isn't good?

398
00:16:51,619 --> 00:16:52,497
Doesn't that mean we're supporting

399
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,019
a shoddy food trend here?

400
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,416
We must never compromise!

401
00:16:55,499 --> 00:16:56,499
Nice!

402
00:16:57,499 --> 00:16:58,499
Hero Peng.

403
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:00,579
You're Hero Peng to me.

404
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,176
Why don't we let
Peng Shi Yan be our class monitor?

405
00:17:04,259 --> 00:17:05,136
Are you guys okay with that?

406
00:17:05,219 --> 00:17:06,057
-Sure!
-Is that okay?

407
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,656
Don't do that! Wait!

408
00:17:07,739 --> 00:17:08,578
Aren't we having lunch?

409
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:10,296
Why am I the class monitor now?

410
00:17:10,379 --> 00:17:11,510
Let's talk about the food.

411
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:12,739
Talk about the food?

412
00:17:15,219 --> 00:17:16,259
What about this?

413
00:17:18,019 --> 00:17:19,628
I'll cook for you guys in the future,

414
00:17:19,979 --> 00:17:20,979
okay?

415
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:22,859
Can you even cook?

416
00:17:23,219 --> 00:17:24,780
Of course.

417
00:17:25,259 --> 00:17:26,577
I would've been a head chef by now

418
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,056
if my nephew didn't want me

419
00:17:28,139 --> 00:17:29,379
to be his stupid successor.

420
00:17:30,859 --> 00:17:32,139
I'm serious.

421
00:17:32,379 --> 00:17:33,379
Okay then.

422
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,540
Tou Tou will be in charge of our food

423
00:17:35,979 --> 00:17:37,060
tomorrow.

424
00:17:37,259 --> 00:17:38,259
What do you think?

425
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,900
I want to order something.

426
00:17:42,859 --> 00:17:43,936
I want Shredded Pork with Garlic Sauce.

427
00:17:44,019 --> 00:17:44,936
Sure.

428
00:17:45,019 --> 00:17:45,818
Shredded Pork with Garlic Sauce.

429
00:17:45,901 --> 00:17:47,099
-Okay.
-Tou Tou.

430
00:17:48,499 --> 00:17:50,097
Can I order Braised Beef?

431
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,259
Sure.

432
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,817
Class monitor, take out
your pen and paper.

433
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,019
Tell him to jot down
what you want tomorrow.

434
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,161
What would you like to order?

435
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,536
Braised Fresh Abalone with Fish Maw.

436
00:18:02,619 --> 00:18:03,900
Braised Fresh Abalone...

437
00:18:06,099 --> 00:18:07,099
What the heck is that?

438
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:14,086
Be careful not to hurt
my ginseng seedling.

439
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:18,139
Mr Ren.

440
00:18:18,499 --> 00:18:19,417
I mean, Professor Ren.

441
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,580
It's been so many years.

442
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,580
Have I ever spoiled your things before?

443
00:18:25,379 --> 00:18:28,510
I would be just like Sun Tou Tou
if I couldn't even differentiate between

444
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:29,998
ginseng seedlings and weeds.

445
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,139
Be careful.

446
00:18:35,979 --> 00:18:37,240
Why don't you do it yourself?

447
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,900
I know.

448
00:18:44,379 --> 00:18:46,580
You're taking a detour
to insult Sun Tou Tou.

449
00:18:47,379 --> 00:18:48,656
I didn't take a detour.

450
00:18:48,739 --> 00:18:50,099
I'm insulting her directly.

451
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,056
Sun Tou Tou

452
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:00,739
is different from us.

453
00:19:01,219 --> 00:19:03,619
She doesn't come from
a good family background like you.

454
00:19:03,859 --> 00:19:06,219
She's not as cultivated as us.

455
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:07,940
No one taught her

456
00:19:08,139 --> 00:19:09,416
about courtesy

457
00:19:09,499 --> 00:19:10,776
or elegance.

458
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:11,776
All of these

459
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:14,619
should be provided during
the family education phase.

460
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,040
But now,

461
00:19:20,619 --> 00:19:22,139
it's our task to educate her.

462
00:19:24,341 --> 00:19:25,346
You see,

463
00:19:26,379 --> 00:19:28,099
she has a sharp sense

464
00:19:28,379 --> 00:19:29,619
of taste and smell.

465
00:19:30,739 --> 00:19:31,697
I think she can

466
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,700
be a TCM practitioner.

467
00:19:35,219 --> 00:19:36,580
That's just on you.

468
00:19:39,259 --> 00:19:40,390
You should be more patient

469
00:19:40,739 --> 00:19:41,739
toward Sun Tou Tou.

470
00:19:43,979 --> 00:19:46,259
It's not like I'm not patient with her.

471
00:19:46,499 --> 00:19:49,460
I don't know her at all.

472
00:19:50,619 --> 00:19:52,139
Wu Shan Dao

473
00:19:52,339 --> 00:19:53,936
just brought her here

474
00:19:54,019 --> 00:19:55,379
and left her to us.

475
00:19:55,739 --> 00:19:57,016
And, she's our senior too.

476
00:19:57,099 --> 00:19:59,536
I've never met a person like her before.

477
00:19:59,619 --> 00:20:01,460
How could I acknowledge
someone like that?

478
00:20:02,259 --> 00:20:04,900
You must believe in
the power of education.

479
00:20:05,499 --> 00:20:06,536
This is just the beginning.

480
00:20:06,619 --> 00:20:07,967
We still have a long way to go.

481
00:20:08,099 --> 00:20:09,379
If, one day,

482
00:20:09,739 --> 00:20:10,776
she couldn't be our successor

483
00:20:10,859 --> 00:20:11,979
or a TCM practitioner,

484
00:20:12,739 --> 00:20:14,300
at least she could become

485
00:20:14,979 --> 00:20:17,296
a well-educated lady.

486
00:20:17,379 --> 00:20:19,536
We're helping society

487
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:24,416
to nurture an educated
and well-mannered lady.

488
00:20:24,499 --> 00:20:25,979
This is merit too, am I right?

489
00:20:26,739 --> 00:20:28,019
Well-mannered lady, huh?

490
00:20:28,379 --> 00:20:29,218
Who do you think

491
00:20:29,301 --> 00:20:30,859
will marry a girl like her?

492
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,128
You're spouting nonsense again.

493
00:20:33,979 --> 00:20:35,414
The Qingming Festival is nearing.

494
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,433
Remember to prepare her dress for her.

495
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:39,657
I was just saying.

496
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,859
I'll still do my part without fail.

497
00:20:42,139 --> 00:20:43,536
I've already told Peng Shi Yan

498
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:45,259
to take their measurements.

499
00:20:47,019 --> 00:20:48,136
Speaking of which,

500
00:20:48,219 --> 00:20:49,900
I have to discuss something with you.

501
00:20:50,859 --> 00:20:51,896
We have so many people here.

502
00:20:51,979 --> 00:20:54,194
We have to spend money
for our daily expenditures, right?

503
00:20:54,277 --> 00:20:55,016
That's right.

504
00:20:55,099 --> 00:20:57,296
Money doesn't fall from
the sky, you know?

505
00:20:57,379 --> 00:21:00,460
And, you can't grow them too.

506
00:21:02,259 --> 00:21:03,416
I'm talking to you.

507
00:21:03,499 --> 00:21:05,416
Will you look for sponsors?

508
00:21:05,499 --> 00:21:06,218
If we have to fork out

509
00:21:06,301 --> 00:21:07,936
our own money all the time,

510
00:21:08,019 --> 00:21:09,498
I don't think we can sustain this.

511
00:21:12,339 --> 00:21:13,660
No effort goes in vain.

512
00:21:15,979 --> 00:21:17,377
When we do good deeds,

513
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,139
do not bring them up.

514
00:21:21,619 --> 00:21:24,176
When we truly can't afford to sustain it,

515
00:21:24,259 --> 00:21:25,303
you can tell me by then.

516
00:21:26,099 --> 00:21:27,499
Right now.

517
00:21:28,739 --> 00:21:29,826
We're in the red already.

518
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:38,379
I...

519
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:49,859
Charge!

520
00:21:51,139 --> 00:21:52,817
That buddy was listless during class.

521
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:53,817
Now that she's outside,

522
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,118
it's like she's on steroids.

523
00:21:55,339 --> 00:21:57,122
She can do everything
except for studying.

524
00:21:57,259 --> 00:21:58,896
If so, why did she join
the apprentice class?

525
00:21:58,979 --> 00:21:59,979
Why don't you ask her?

526
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:01,780
Fine.

527
00:22:04,739 --> 00:22:06,499
Tou, I have a question.

528
00:22:07,019 --> 00:22:08,056
Why did you join the apprentice class

529
00:22:08,139 --> 00:22:09,139
when you hate studying?

530
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,460
As the saying goes, gifts blind the eyes.

531
00:22:11,739 --> 00:22:12,739
He already paid me.

532
00:22:12,979 --> 00:22:14,176
I have to study TCM or cook

533
00:22:14,259 --> 00:22:15,390
as long as he wants me to.

534
00:22:15,859 --> 00:22:17,296
So, a cook like you is studying TCM?

535
00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:18,739
That's quite a huge leap.

536
00:22:19,859 --> 00:22:21,120
That's none of your business.

537
00:22:26,379 --> 00:22:27,739
Let me clarify something.

538
00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:28,858
Only take what we need.

539
00:22:28,941 --> 00:22:30,724
I won't pay for anything
outside the list.

540
00:22:31,619 --> 00:22:34,139
I can buy snacks with the money
I save, right?

541
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,460
No.

542
00:22:36,219 --> 00:22:37,379
Why not?

543
00:22:38,739 --> 00:22:40,377
No means no.

544
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,056
It's not like snacks are expensive.

545
00:22:42,139 --> 00:22:43,256
You will only buy the things

546
00:22:43,339 --> 00:22:44,296
that are written on the list.

547
00:22:44,379 --> 00:22:45,296
Excuse me.

548
00:22:45,379 --> 00:22:46,177
Sorry for the interruption.

549
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,176
I'm running a business nearby.

550
00:22:48,259 --> 00:22:49,420
-Can I...
-No, thanks.

551
00:22:51,339 --> 00:22:52,656
Can I add you on WeChat?

552
00:22:52,739 --> 00:22:55,379
-What kind of business?
-I'm running a nail salon.

553
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,056
Sure.

554
00:22:57,139 --> 00:22:58,139
Really?

555
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,416
I added you.

556
00:23:04,499 --> 00:23:05,672
Okay. Thank you.

557
00:23:05,755 --> 00:23:06,755
Don't mention it.

558
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,457
You're really bold, aren't you?

559
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,776
Do you know

560
00:23:11,859 --> 00:23:14,536
that she can steal your
personal information, bank details,

561
00:23:14,619 --> 00:23:16,176
and your money from that scan?

562
00:23:16,259 --> 00:23:17,577
You have no safety awareness at all.

563
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:18,896
What a coincidence.

564
00:23:18,979 --> 00:23:21,176
First, there's no money
in my bank account.

565
00:23:21,259 --> 00:23:22,256
Second,

566
00:23:22,339 --> 00:23:23,339
she's cute.

567
00:23:23,739 --> 00:23:25,256
If she tries to take advantage of me,

568
00:23:25,339 --> 00:23:27,019
I think it's my gain instead.

569
00:23:27,379 --> 00:23:28,379
Am I right?

570
00:23:36,619 --> 00:23:37,979
You were fine just now.

571
00:23:38,139 --> 00:23:39,256
What's wrong? Get up!

572
00:23:39,339 --> 00:23:40,339
My tummy hurts!

573
00:23:42,259 --> 00:23:43,936
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

574
00:23:44,019 --> 00:23:45,697
Miss, is it abdominal pain
or stomach pain?

575
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:46,776
Stomach pain.

576
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:47,896
I had diarrhoea today.

577
00:23:47,979 --> 00:23:49,110
I didn't have lunch today.

578
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,377
This is a case of Tai Yin disease.

579
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,416
What disease?

580
00:23:51,499 --> 00:23:53,282
-Tai Yin disease.
-Are you on your period?

581
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,136
Do you take

582
00:23:55,219 --> 00:23:56,056
cold food and drinks usually?

583
00:23:56,139 --> 00:23:56,896
Should we call an ambulance?

584
00:23:56,979 --> 00:23:57,979
Wait.

585
00:23:58,259 --> 00:23:59,377
I think she's on her period.
She forgot to have lunch too.

586
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,776
That's why her blood sugar level is low.

587
00:24:00,859 --> 00:24:02,416
-Should we call 120?
-What's the matter?

588
00:24:02,499 --> 00:24:04,016
Should we call an ambulance?

589
00:24:04,099 --> 00:24:05,416
Can you get me some brown sugar water?

590
00:24:05,499 --> 00:24:06,577
She might be suffering from
hypoglycaemia.

591
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,458
Who are you guys?

592
00:24:07,541 --> 00:24:08,619
We're doctors.

593
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,822
(Xu Meng)

594
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,016
Shan Dao.

595
00:24:32,099 --> 00:24:33,099
(Senior.)

596
00:24:33,379 --> 00:24:34,257
(Do you intend to bring the kids)

597
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,056
(to Mount Huafeng during
Qingming Festival?)

598
00:24:36,139 --> 00:24:37,176
(Do you lack anything?)

599
00:24:37,259 --> 00:24:38,379
Nope.

600
00:24:38,499 --> 00:24:39,776
Ling Ian will prepare everything.

601
00:24:39,859 --> 00:24:40,859
Are you going?

602
00:24:41,379 --> 00:24:42,377
I have several meetings to attend.

603
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,416
Let's see how it goes.

604
00:24:43,499 --> 00:24:46,536
However, I checked the weather forecast.

605
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:48,296
(It would be raining on those few days.)

606
00:24:48,379 --> 00:24:50,700
You have to prepare
some raincoats and boots.

607
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,737
The road condition there is terrible.

608
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:53,896
Great suggestion.

609
00:24:53,979 --> 00:24:55,197
I'll tell Ling Ian about it.

610
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,780
Say, is Ling Ian beside you?

611
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,069
Nope. She's busy with something else.

612
00:25:01,339 --> 00:25:02,859
I called you

613
00:25:03,259 --> 00:25:06,619
because I have something important
to tell you.

614
00:25:07,019 --> 00:25:08,019
What is it? Speak up.

615
00:25:08,499 --> 00:25:11,259
(Don't you want to take a walk with me?)

616
00:25:15,619 --> 00:25:16,619
Is it something huge?

617
00:25:21,859 --> 00:25:22,859
Ren.

618
00:25:24,139 --> 00:25:25,536
What is it?

619
00:25:25,619 --> 00:25:26,793
You're being so mysterious.

620
00:25:27,379 --> 00:25:28,979
It's about Little Lark.

621
00:25:29,499 --> 00:25:30,499
What a coincidence.

622
00:25:31,019 --> 00:25:32,136
When I was performing outpatient duty,

623
00:25:32,219 --> 00:25:33,577
I encountered an outlander patient.

624
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:35,979
He said a divine healer
went to their place.

625
00:25:36,139 --> 00:25:37,656
And, that divine healer was the one

626
00:25:37,739 --> 00:25:39,460
who recommended him to our hospital.

627
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,363
What has this got to do with Little Lark?

628
00:25:43,499 --> 00:25:46,379
My guess is that the divine healer
is Little Lark herself.

629
00:25:49,219 --> 00:25:52,296
I've already inquired about her looks
and age.

630
00:25:52,379 --> 00:25:53,177
It's pretty close.

631
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,016
And, according to what the patient said,

632
00:25:55,099 --> 00:25:56,577
she received professional training

633
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,499
for her career.

634
00:25:59,859 --> 00:26:01,176
She's not a casual practitioner.

635
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:03,564
There's one more thing
that makes it more interesting.

636
00:26:04,139 --> 00:26:05,900
That divine healer is staying on

637
00:26:06,499 --> 00:26:08,580
Mount Huafeng's hillside.

638
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,099
That's why I dare to assume

639
00:26:12,506 --> 00:26:14,866
that the divine healer
is Little Lark herself.

640
00:26:15,859 --> 00:26:18,499
I think she still misses you.

641
00:26:19,259 --> 00:26:22,780
And, she knows that you'll visit
that place every year.

642
00:26:35,739 --> 00:26:36,739
What do you think?

643
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,060
You must be tempted.

644
00:26:51,219 --> 00:26:52,219
Listen.

645
00:26:52,499 --> 00:26:54,176
Add some yogurt to it later.

646
00:26:54,259 --> 00:26:55,259
It'll taste better.

647
00:26:55,379 --> 00:26:56,379
Got it?

648
00:26:57,139 --> 00:26:58,056
Tou,

649
00:26:58,139 --> 00:26:59,979
you're truly a culinary expert indeed.

650
00:27:02,379 --> 00:27:03,296
I plan

651
00:27:03,379 --> 00:27:04,297
to make this fruit salad

652
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,499
as nice as possible.

653
00:27:06,379 --> 00:27:07,256
We can use it to curry favour

654
00:27:07,339 --> 00:27:08,339
with the elite student.

655
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,296
I'll try to make her

656
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:11,337
share her notes

657
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,420
with us.

658
00:27:31,139 --> 00:27:32,139
Rebecca,

659
00:27:32,499 --> 00:27:33,577
are you done with your workout?

660
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:34,660
Good job.

661
00:27:35,019 --> 00:27:36,460
I prepared some delicious

662
00:27:36,739 --> 00:27:38,296
fruit salad for you.

663
00:27:38,379 --> 00:27:39,379
Here you go.

664
00:27:40,139 --> 00:27:41,139
I'm on a diet.

665
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,256
I used sugar-free yogurt.

666
00:27:48,339 --> 00:27:50,219
It won't affect your diet.

667
00:27:50,339 --> 00:27:51,339
Here.

668
00:27:53,619 --> 00:27:54,859
I don't take fruits.

669
00:27:57,739 --> 00:27:59,056
That's pretty unique.

670
00:27:59,139 --> 00:28:00,097
I'll remember that.

671
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,979
Your notes are very complete.

672
00:28:02,619 --> 00:28:04,979
Lawyers are detailed
and meticulous indeed.

673
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,120
What about this?

674
00:28:06,219 --> 00:28:07,296
Why don't you share your notes

675
00:28:07,379 --> 00:28:09,139
with the rest of the class?

676
00:28:09,379 --> 00:28:10,377
Why should I?

677
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:12,237
So that we can identify the leaks
and improve together.

678
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,296
No.

679
00:28:13,379 --> 00:28:14,577
I paid attention in class

680
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:15,697
and worked hard to jot down the notes.

681
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:16,657
You guys didn't.

682
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,016
What gives you guys the right

683
00:28:18,099 --> 00:28:19,256
to enjoy the fruit of my lab our?

684
00:28:19,339 --> 00:28:21,339
You're acting like
my primary school desk mate.

685
00:28:21,739 --> 00:28:23,296
It's not like there's
a bottom-out system in place.

686
00:28:23,379 --> 00:28:24,297
What's wrong with sharing your notes?

687
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,780
Although that's the case,

688
00:28:25,979 --> 00:28:27,776
there's a difference between
elites like me and you all.

689
00:28:27,859 --> 00:28:28,577
Since I worked hard on it,

690
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,577
that means I'm capable

691
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:30,537
and I'm the better one.

692
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:32,656
Anyway, it's unfair for lazy
people and hard-working people

693
00:28:32,739 --> 00:28:34,660
to achieve the same result.

694
00:28:36,019 --> 00:28:37,379
My goodness.

695
00:28:38,379 --> 00:28:39,257
So, you think you won't need

696
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:41,297
other people's help
for the rest of your life?

697
00:28:43,619 --> 00:28:44,619
Fine.

698
00:28:45,972 --> 00:28:46,972
Fine.

699
00:28:54,739 --> 00:28:55,739
This is great.

700
00:29:12,499 --> 00:29:13,499
Where did you go?

701
00:29:14,979 --> 00:29:15,979
I went to take a walk.

702
00:29:16,139 --> 00:29:17,580
Why didn't you invite me?

703
00:29:18,379 --> 00:29:19,416
We should've gone there together.

704
00:29:19,499 --> 00:29:21,847
You could take your walk
while I could practice boxing.

705
00:29:25,019 --> 00:29:26,019
Sun Tou Tou,

706
00:29:26,379 --> 00:29:27,499
where's my blanched kale?

707
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:29,619
It's outside.

708
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,257
I told you before.

709
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:32,619
I only take blanched kale.

710
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:33,979
You see,

711
00:29:34,099 --> 00:29:35,536
kale is pretty bitter.

712
00:29:35,619 --> 00:29:38,379
It'll taste better if you add
some minced meat and garlic.

713
00:29:45,379 --> 00:29:46,771
Roubecca, you're something else.

714
00:29:46,979 --> 00:29:48,256
You only take cucumbers?

715
00:29:48,339 --> 00:29:49,600
Do you think you're a rabbit?

716
00:29:54,339 --> 00:29:55,499
Look at all these dishes.

717
00:29:56,019 --> 00:29:57,019
Coming.

718
00:29:58,499 --> 00:30:00,176
This is the last dish.

719
00:30:00,259 --> 00:30:02,056
Tou Tou, did you make all of them?

720
00:30:02,139 --> 00:30:03,339
Of course.

721
00:30:03,619 --> 00:30:04,597
Not bad at all.

722
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,416
Nephew,

723
00:30:05,499 --> 00:30:07,717
try the Shredded Pork with Garlic Sauce
you ordered.

724
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,520
Try it. Are you doing face reading here?

725
00:30:24,859 --> 00:30:25,859
It's pretty good.

726
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:28,259
That's it?

727
00:30:28,379 --> 00:30:29,379
Yeah.

728
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:30,780
Tou Tou.

729
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,060
When Mr Ren says

730
00:30:32,219 --> 00:30:34,099
"pretty good", that's the best remark

731
00:30:34,219 --> 00:30:35,577
you can get from him.

732
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:36,697
Is that so?

733
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,817
He had me for a second.
I thought it wasn't good.

734
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,296
Everyone, eat up.

735
00:30:40,379 --> 00:30:41,536
-You compliment people like that?
-Let's dig in.

736
00:30:41,619 --> 00:30:42,619
Try my cooking.

737
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,296
By the way, Niece-in-law,

738
00:31:00,379 --> 00:31:01,377
Nephew,

739
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,460
we met a girl in the supermarket today.

740
00:31:03,619 --> 00:31:04,936
Her tummy was aching so badly

741
00:31:05,019 --> 00:31:06,416
that she couldn't straighten her back.

742
00:31:06,499 --> 00:31:08,099
This kid went to her

743
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,607
and gave her two needles.

744
00:31:10,492 --> 00:31:11,623
She recovered immediately.

745
00:31:11,859 --> 00:31:12,657
He was amazing.

746
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,416
I do believe in the power of acupuncture
after today.

747
00:31:14,499 --> 00:31:15,499
Is that so?

748
00:31:15,997 --> 00:31:16,896
Son,

749
00:31:16,979 --> 00:31:18,545
tell us about your glorious history.

750
00:31:19,259 --> 00:31:20,176
Mum, don't listen to her.

751
00:31:20,259 --> 00:31:21,339
You're being modest now?

752
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,177
Madam Song, it's like this.

753
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,019
I read the pulse of that girl.

754
00:31:24,379 --> 00:31:25,416
According to the pulse reading

755
00:31:25,499 --> 00:31:26,817
and the fact that she had diarrhoea,

756
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,536
I deduced that it was a case
of Tai Yin disease.

757
00:31:28,619 --> 00:31:29,697
Tian Zhen and Shi Yan thought

758
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:30,859
that she felt giddy

759
00:31:31,219 --> 00:31:33,524
due to hypoglycaemia
as she didn't eat the entire day.

760
00:31:33,619 --> 00:31:35,880
I assumed that she was
going to have her period soon.

761
00:31:36,259 --> 00:31:37,619
How did you treat her then?

762
00:31:38,099 --> 00:31:40,176
I targeted her thenar muscle,
Nei Guan Meridian, and He Gu Meridian.

763
00:31:40,259 --> 00:31:41,896
She was fine when I read her pulse again.

764
00:31:41,979 --> 00:31:43,197
I assume that she recovered.

765
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,099
That was mystical.

766
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:46,867
She recovered immediately

767
00:31:47,139 --> 00:31:49,416
after getting pricked by needles.

768
00:31:49,499 --> 00:31:51,339
I'm serious. It worked immediately.

769
00:31:55,499 --> 00:31:56,660
Where is she now?

770
00:32:00,139 --> 00:32:01,139
I don't know.

771
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,056
She looked fine to me.

772
00:32:02,139 --> 00:32:03,660
We didn't keep her contact number.

773
00:32:03,859 --> 00:32:04,859
None of you kept it?

774
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Nope.

775
00:32:08,499 --> 00:32:09,499
Hurry and look for her!

776
00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:13,099
Where can we find her?

777
00:32:13,979 --> 00:32:15,259
I know!

778
00:32:16,139 --> 00:32:18,400
She can be found at the alley
behind the supermarket.

779
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:19,580
No. 7, Zimu Street.

780
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:23,817
I'll send her contact number
to you guys through the group chat.

781
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:24,900
Wait!

782
00:32:25,379 --> 00:32:26,296
You guys are done with lunch?

783
00:32:26,379 --> 00:32:27,377
Tou,

784
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:29,499
how did you know her address?

785
00:32:31,259 --> 00:32:32,912
I scanned the QR code for her profile.

786
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:44,700
Do you want some water?

787
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:50,900
Dad.

788
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:52,219
Mum.

789
00:32:52,339 --> 00:32:53,339
She's fine now.

790
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:56,219
She just underwent
a unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.

791
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,416
You started reading pulse
when you were four.

792
00:33:12,499 --> 00:33:13,896
You started studying TCM under me
when you were seven.

793
00:33:13,979 --> 00:33:15,458
You studied under me for 20 years.

794
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,817
20 years, you know?

795
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:17,900
What exactly

796
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,780
did you learn?

797
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,337
Mr Ren,

798
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,257
we couldn't tell too.

799
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,697
That girl was so young.

800
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:30,697
Who would've expected her
to have eccyesis?

801
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:31,824
I wasn't talking to you.

802
00:33:34,259 --> 00:33:35,296
If we didn't manage

803
00:33:35,379 --> 00:33:36,337
to save the girl today,

804
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:39,379
you would've killed her
with a license in your hand!

805
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,420
Li Quan.

806
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,114
You should head back first.

807
00:34:05,379 --> 00:34:07,499
This should be the one.

808
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:16,960
Roubecca,

809
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:20,299
you do have a unique preference
for dolls, huh?

810
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,760
No.

811
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,332
That's not the Tai Yin Meridian.

812
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,577
This is Tai Yin Meridian.

813
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:28,700
That's not true.

814
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:30,020
My nephew said

815
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:32,016
that the area is Yang
if it's facing the sunlight.

816
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:33,577
It's Yin when the sunlight
can't get to it.

817
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:35,400
Look at your own elbows. They're tanned.

818
00:34:35,483 --> 00:34:37,701
That's why the Tai Yin Meridian
isn't located there.

819
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,776
Weren't you sleeping during class?

820
00:34:44,859 --> 00:34:45,940
I was just absorbed.

821
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:49,700
Elite student, huh?

822
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:51,633
You're just good at memorizing things.

823
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:54,536
Don't touch it.

824
00:34:54,619 --> 00:34:55,337
Fine.

825
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,420
I won't touch it.

826
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,379
Is this your Jigglypuff?

827
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:03,016
This is the doll I use to learn

828
00:35:03,099 --> 00:35:04,337
meridians and acupressure points.

829
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,700
Jigglypuff is for kids.

830
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,768
You even prepared this as well?

831
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,339
I, Rebecca,
never fight a battle unprepared.

832
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,040
Amazing.

833
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:15,097
You do live up to your name
as an elite student.

834
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,180
Lend it to me.

835
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:19,296
This is my learning tool.

836
00:35:19,379 --> 00:35:20,500
If you want one,

837
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,180
you can buy it online.

838
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,700
You're so petty.

839
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,139
Fine, I'll buy one myself.

840
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,577
What's the name of this product?

841
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:33,700
Is it rubber doll?

842
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,660
After that, find the elbow.

843
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:43,339
Starting from here, three, four, five.

844
00:35:51,859 --> 00:35:52,946
You went overboard today.

845
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:55,700
Get up.

846
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,940
Get up.

847
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,695
Are you saying that
I've criticized your son too harshly?

848
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,099
Just look at your son.

849
00:36:07,619 --> 00:36:08,897
He's fine.

850
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:09,980
But you?

851
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:13,180
If it weren't for Tou Tou, and us,

852
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:15,420
I assume

853
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:17,921
that girl would've been gone.

854
00:36:21,619 --> 00:36:23,016
I think

855
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:24,220
that's understandable.

856
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:27,339
Think about it. Our son just received
his medical license.

857
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:29,657
And he's not an official doctor yet.

858
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:30,740
They just

859
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,097
met a person who was
in need of assistance

860
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:33,500
in the supermarket.

861
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,400
Besides, Peng Shi Yan was around too.

862
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,153
Peng Shi Yan studies Western medicine.

863
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,536
He has a different medical speciality.

864
00:36:38,619 --> 00:36:39,577
He's in the Department of Paediatrics.

865
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,177
It's understandable for him to
have no idea what to do.

866
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:42,739
But our son comes from a family of

867
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,897
TCM practitioners and specialises
in obstetrics and paediatrics.

868
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:47,459
How could he not know what to do?
That doesn't make sense!

869
00:36:52,859 --> 00:36:53,980
Your son was right.

870
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,577
We shouldn't have forced him
to study TCM.

871
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:57,660
This kid

872
00:36:59,339 --> 00:37:00,600
isn't cut out for this field.

873
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,339
Have you not committed a mistake before?

874
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:08,940
Did you forget what happened
to Master Chen Fu?

875
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,180
As doctors,

876
00:37:16,099 --> 00:37:19,177
we grow alongside
the life and death of patients.

877
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,657
It may sound cruel,

878
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,099
but that's the truth.

879
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,240
Your son is only 26 years old this year.

880
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,700
How old are you?

881
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,460
You used the term "kill".

882
00:37:31,579 --> 00:37:32,840
That was pretty harsh of you.

883
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:34,857
Aren't you afraid
that it'll ruin his confidence

884
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,420
in practising medicine?

885
00:37:36,859 --> 00:37:38,900
Confidence?

886
00:37:39,779 --> 00:37:41,220
Confidence, my foot.

887
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:44,460
He's just a snowflake.

888
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,779
You dote on your son.

889
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:50,020
His grandparents dote on him.

890
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:52,579
All of our relatives dote on him.

891
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,137
You guys will clean up his mess

892
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:56,016
when he commits mistakes.

893
00:37:56,099 --> 00:37:58,980
You're doing it to look after
that fragile dignity of his.

894
00:38:02,099 --> 00:38:03,337
In front of a patient's life,

895
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:04,420
confidence and dignity

896
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,099
mean nothing.

897
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:10,339
You don't care about him usually.

898
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,859
You only reprimand him
when he makes a mistake.

899
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,536
What gives us the right
to be his parents then?

900
00:38:15,619 --> 00:38:16,619
As parents,

901
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,768
don't you think we should
be responsible for our child?

902
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,337
Sun Tou Tou doesn't have parents.

903
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,942
Who'll be responsible for her then?

904
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:31,180
Being responsible, huh?

905
00:38:31,619 --> 00:38:33,837
We should always be responsible
for our own actions.

906
00:38:34,339 --> 00:38:35,687
Come and practice your writing.

907
00:38:39,779 --> 00:38:40,779
No, I won't.

908
00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:43,296
Do you think I can practice
my writing nonchalantly

909
00:38:43,379 --> 00:38:44,098
like you

910
00:38:44,181 --> 00:38:46,180
after reprimanding our son?

911
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:48,740
Listen.

912
00:38:49,139 --> 00:38:50,337
I still haven't improved
after all these years

913
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:52,417
all because of you.
You make me angry all the time.

914
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,500
After I get angry,

915
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,921
I have to take my time

916
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,500
to digest my emotions.

917
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:04,220
That's absurd.

918
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:05,660
What's absurd?

919
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,248
The ink hasn't been ground yet.

920
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:24,460
Tian Zhen,

921
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,506
your father must've reprimanded you.

922
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,097
This isn't entirely your fault.

923
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,180
We're at fault too.

924
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:33,247
There's a bad thing about
Western medicine.

925
00:39:33,339 --> 00:39:35,377
Our specialities are way too different
from each other.

926
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,460
I...

927
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,700
I can't do anything

928
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,158
when it comes to O&G issues.

929
00:39:41,859 --> 00:39:42,857
Speaking of which,

930
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:44,417
you TCM practitioners
are much better than us.

931
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,377
You have to know every
worldly knowledge there is.

932
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:48,256
And, you have to be familiar
with all kinds of diseases.

933
00:39:48,339 --> 00:39:49,687
You guys are just like deities.

934
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:50,857
Your parents

935
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:52,339
are amazing figures indeed.

936
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:54,900
At first, I did suspect it.

937
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:57,536
I should've told that girl

938
00:39:57,619 --> 00:39:59,220
to get a check-up in the hospital.

939
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:00,918
It's all because of Tou Tou.

940
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:02,178
Besides,

941
00:40:02,261 --> 00:40:03,417
that girl

942
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,859
looked like a decent girl.

943
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,339
Who has rubber dolls?

944
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,500
We can talk about the dolls next time.

945
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:22,859
See what you would like to eat.

946
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:24,984
This is tomorrow's menu.

947
00:40:27,099 --> 00:40:28,621
Is there anything you want to have?

948
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:39,700
What's wrong?

949
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,139
Did that girl die?

950
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,056
Nonsense.

951
00:40:43,139 --> 00:40:43,976
Stop jinxing it.

952
00:40:44,059 --> 00:40:45,059
We saved her.

953
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:46,777
You had me for a second there.

954
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,208
What's with the long face then?

955
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,779
One of her Fallopian tubes was removed.

956
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:56,099
How many Fallopian tubes
does a woman have?

957
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,256
Two.

958
00:40:57,339 --> 00:40:58,517
That means she has one left, right?

959
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,600
That's fine, right?

960
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:03,256
What illness does she have?

961
00:41:03,339 --> 00:41:05,779
My nephew and niece-in-law
were quite nervous about it.

962
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:07,700
It's eccyesis.

963
00:41:08,859 --> 00:41:09,859
Eccyesis?

964
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,130
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

965
00:41:14,213 --> 00:41:15,630
(are referenced from relevant
traditional Chinese medicine books)

966
00:41:15,713 --> 00:41:18,018
