00:01:30,685 --> 00:01:34,904
(Gen Z)

2
00:01:35,562 --> 00:01:37,840
(Episode 26)

3
00:01:41,974 --> 00:01:43,494
Dinner is served.

4
00:01:44,173 --> 00:01:46,453
Sir, don't you think I'm considerate?

5
00:01:48,614 --> 00:01:49,774
Grandpa, I said

6
00:01:49,774 --> 00:01:51,334
I didn't want to eat.

7
00:01:58,494 --> 00:01:59,286
Look at you.

8
00:01:59,814 --> 00:02:01,174
You're not eating or drinking.

9
00:02:01,734 --> 00:02:03,014
And, you're in a terrible mood.

10
00:02:03,654 --> 00:02:04,734
You're sick.

11
00:02:04,982 --> 00:02:05,814
I'm not.

12
00:02:05,814 --> 00:02:08,093
When I say you're sick,
you're definitely sick.

13
00:02:08,893 --> 00:02:10,374
I'm experienced.

14
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:13,654
You're lovesick.

15
00:02:15,214 --> 00:02:16,573
So, you fancy someone, huh?

16
00:02:17,014 --> 00:02:18,854
How could you relate this to that?

17
00:02:19,214 --> 00:02:20,107
This sucks.

18
00:02:20,654 --> 00:02:22,534
Since you didn't deny it,
I guess it must be true then.

19
00:02:24,374 --> 00:02:26,054
-Is it her?
-Who?

20
00:02:26,214 --> 00:02:27,099
That girl.

21
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:28,694
Stop guessing.

22
00:02:29,054 --> 00:02:30,054
You're wrong.

23
00:02:30,854 --> 00:02:32,854
Fine, let me ask you this then.

24
00:02:36,494 --> 00:02:38,374
Did you not confess to her?

25
00:02:41,654 --> 00:02:43,134
Does she know your feelings for her?

26
00:02:47,654 --> 00:02:48,513
I understand now.

27
00:02:49,094 --> 00:02:50,573
You're afraid that your mother
will disagree.

28
00:02:51,014 --> 00:02:52,014
I don't need to be afraid.

29
00:02:52,414 --> 00:02:53,853
She'll definitely disagree.

30
00:02:55,694 --> 00:02:57,134
Enough, let's drop the topic.

31
00:02:57,134 --> 00:02:58,454
Come and have dinner.

32
00:02:58,734 --> 00:02:59,607
Have it while it's hot.

33
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:02,734
Tou Tou kept the best for you.

34
00:03:02,734 --> 00:03:04,654
These are pork ribs.

35
00:03:05,454 --> 00:03:07,014
She even got you a bottle of yogurt.

36
00:03:07,014 --> 00:03:09,414
It's a balanced meal.

37
00:03:09,414 --> 00:03:10,853
You shouldn't

38
00:03:10,853 --> 00:03:11,893
waste her effort.

39
00:03:12,813 --> 00:03:13,774
Come on.

40
00:03:14,573 --> 00:03:15,694
At least she still has a conscience.

41
00:03:17,134 --> 00:03:18,573
Come on.

42
00:03:20,054 --> 00:03:20,888
Okay.

43
00:03:31,094 --> 00:03:32,213
Look at you.

44
00:03:32,374 --> 00:03:35,134
You're not young,
and you come from a great background.

45
00:03:35,774 --> 00:03:36,974
But you don't want

46
00:03:37,573 --> 00:03:38,734
to find a suitable partner

47
00:03:38,734 --> 00:03:40,454
and bring her back.

48
00:03:41,853 --> 00:03:43,613
I guess I'm a lousy person.

49
00:03:44,414 --> 00:03:46,733
I won't allow you to say that
about yourself.

50
00:03:46,774 --> 00:03:48,694
You're a kind child.

51
00:03:49,494 --> 00:03:50,396
Remember the girl

52
00:03:50,774 --> 00:03:52,134
you fancied last time?

53
00:03:54,054 --> 00:03:55,733
Alright, I'll stop.

54
00:03:57,574 --> 00:03:58,494
To be honest,

55
00:03:59,574 --> 00:04:00,774
your mother

56
00:04:01,494 --> 00:04:02,934
is difficult to convince.

57
00:04:02,974 --> 00:04:03,854
You have to find someone

58
00:04:03,854 --> 00:04:05,013
of equal background.

59
00:04:05,013 --> 00:04:06,774
Am I getting married?
Or is she getting married?

60
00:04:08,294 --> 00:04:10,494
How can you get married
if you go against her will?

61
00:04:15,694 --> 00:04:16,574
I'll stay single then.

62
00:04:35,214 --> 00:04:38,414
I've fished out some information
from your beloved grandson.

63
00:04:38,774 --> 00:04:40,134
It's that girl.

64
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:46,494
Ling Lan

65
00:04:46,854 --> 00:04:48,533
will never accept this.

66
00:04:49,893 --> 00:04:52,494
Nobody can accept this.

67
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:55,334
Can Ling Lan stop being picky?

68
00:04:55,334 --> 00:04:56,414
If this keeps up,

69
00:04:56,854 --> 00:04:58,854
my grandson will stay single forever.

70
00:04:59,774 --> 00:05:00,974
What's wrong with being single?

71
00:05:03,054 --> 00:05:05,653
It's not like we have a throne
for him to inherit.

72
00:05:07,093 --> 00:05:08,130
But...

73
00:05:20,574 --> 00:05:22,093
It's been a long time since you sang.

74
00:05:22,694 --> 00:05:23,974
Seems like you're in a great mood today.

75
00:05:24,214 --> 00:05:25,533
Here, let me add some hot water.

76
00:05:26,934 --> 00:05:27,872
Lift your feet.

77
00:05:31,334 --> 00:05:33,694
Contact Mr Tu tomorrow

78
00:05:33,694 --> 00:05:34,733
and arrange for a meal.

79
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:36,054
Tell him to take Ming Mou along.

80
00:05:36,774 --> 00:05:37,774
I suggest you

81
00:05:37,774 --> 00:05:40,334
ask for your son's opinion first.

82
00:05:40,334 --> 00:05:42,013
If he doesn't cooperate,

83
00:05:42,173 --> 00:05:43,613
you'll be buying a meal for nothing.

84
00:05:44,574 --> 00:05:47,040
We're just having a meal with his uncle.

85
00:05:48,774 --> 00:05:49,613
I'll tell him.

86
00:05:57,294 --> 00:05:58,193
I'm not going!

87
00:05:59,213 --> 00:06:01,373
It's been a long time since we met.

88
00:06:01,854 --> 00:06:03,213
It's just a meal.

89
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:05,694
Can't you just cooperate with me?

90
00:06:06,614 --> 00:06:08,014
Mum, I know exactly

91
00:06:08,014 --> 00:06:09,294
what you're up to.

92
00:06:09,373 --> 00:06:11,454
I already have someone in my heart.
You can forget about it.

93
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:20,014
If so, you can keep her inside
your heart until she suffocates.

94
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,938
(Grain Buds signifies
the coming of summer.)

95
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,060
(Summer crops are abundant,
but not ready to be harvested yet.)

96
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,565
(Thus, it is known as Grain Buds.)

97
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,095
(During Grain Buds,
rain increases gradually.)

98
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,497
(With a plain diet,
we control our desires.)

99
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:02,512
(Grain Buds)

100
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:23,294
Li Quan, you're here.

101
00:07:23,614 --> 00:07:24,414
Mr Wu.

102
00:07:24,854 --> 00:07:25,894
Were you looking for me?

103
00:07:26,174 --> 00:07:27,014
Have a seat.

104
00:07:40,174 --> 00:07:41,294
Have a seat.

105
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,333
Long time no see.

106
00:07:47,014 --> 00:07:47,894
I heard

107
00:07:49,134 --> 00:07:50,854
that it's been over a month
since you applied for leave.

108
00:07:52,053 --> 00:07:55,614
Are you still working as a foot masseur
in the foot reflexology shop?

109
00:07:59,014 --> 00:08:00,174
Are you facing financial difficulties?

110
00:08:01,894 --> 00:08:04,414
There's nothing embarrassing about that.

111
00:08:04,894 --> 00:08:06,174
Listen.

112
00:08:06,174 --> 00:08:08,174
I was poorer than you

113
00:08:08,174 --> 00:08:09,213
when I was your age.

114
00:08:10,014 --> 00:08:11,574
Back then, I was

115
00:08:11,614 --> 00:08:13,333
utterly broke.

116
00:08:13,974 --> 00:08:16,414
I didn't dare to confess
to the girl I fancied

117
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:18,614
as I was afraid that I'd be rejected.

118
00:08:18,734 --> 00:08:20,014
I was afraid that
I might drag her down with me.

119
00:08:24,454 --> 00:08:25,813
But I was thinking to myself,

120
00:08:26,134 --> 00:08:27,894
if you truly

121
00:08:28,014 --> 00:08:30,574
have a larger financial demand,

122
00:08:31,694 --> 00:08:33,174
working as a foot masseur

123
00:08:35,294 --> 00:08:37,213
isn't going to work out
for you in the long run.

124
00:08:38,454 --> 00:08:39,854
I was thinking that
I should introduce you

125
00:08:41,174 --> 00:08:43,213
to be a pharmaceutical rep.

126
00:08:44,614 --> 00:08:46,294
You'll work under Mr Zheng,
who's cooperating with our academy.

127
00:08:47,014 --> 00:08:47,950
I'm close to him.

128
00:08:48,734 --> 00:08:50,294
I took you there before.

129
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:51,734
You met him too, right?

130
00:08:52,093 --> 00:08:53,294
I'll contact him.

131
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:55,716
What do you think?

132
00:08:58,773 --> 00:08:59,854
Do you have any concerns?

133
00:09:03,614 --> 00:09:04,414
Mr Wu,

134
00:09:05,454 --> 00:09:07,694
my brother got into
the town's high school.

135
00:09:08,734 --> 00:09:10,574
We have to spend a lot
on his education fees.

136
00:09:11,174 --> 00:09:12,053
And now,

137
00:09:12,053 --> 00:09:14,040
my father is bedridden
due to rheumatism.

138
00:09:15,014 --> 00:09:17,574
I'm the sole breadwinner of the family.

139
00:09:18,734 --> 00:09:20,574
Thank you for your kind offer.

140
00:09:22,134 --> 00:09:24,213
However, I don't think I'll do well

141
00:09:24,213 --> 00:09:25,414
as a pharmaceutical rep.

142
00:09:26,014 --> 00:09:27,694
I'm different from Tian Zhen
and the rest.

143
00:09:27,894 --> 00:09:28,854
I don't have any resources

144
00:09:28,854 --> 00:09:30,493
or connections in this city.

145
00:09:31,694 --> 00:09:32,974
I don't think I can
reach my sales target.

146
00:09:35,614 --> 00:09:36,574
Don't worry.

147
00:09:37,694 --> 00:09:39,174
I know poor students like us

148
00:09:39,174 --> 00:09:40,574
don't have any connections.

149
00:09:40,894 --> 00:09:42,294
But we can fight for it,

150
00:09:42,734 --> 00:09:43,622
am I right?

151
00:09:44,014 --> 00:09:45,813
There's no free lunch in the world.

152
00:09:46,933 --> 00:09:47,894
You see, for a man,

153
00:09:48,014 --> 00:09:48,854
no matter

154
00:09:49,253 --> 00:09:53,333
if he's born with a silver spoon or not,

155
00:09:53,614 --> 00:09:56,213
he has to rely on himself to succeed.

156
00:09:57,294 --> 00:09:58,454
Connections are nothing.

157
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:00,414
If you learn how to sweet talk

158
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,174
and be hard-working,

159
00:10:02,174 --> 00:10:04,134
you can build connections easily.

160
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:05,333
Don't worry.

161
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,093
However, I have one piece
of advice for you.

162
00:10:08,734 --> 00:10:10,254
I hope you won't become

163
00:10:10,254 --> 00:10:11,934
a full-time pharmaceutical rep.

164
00:10:12,494 --> 00:10:14,013
You have to spare some time

165
00:10:14,533 --> 00:10:15,693
for your studies too.

166
00:10:17,174 --> 00:10:18,494
I trust you.

167
00:10:18,494 --> 00:10:19,814
I also believe

168
00:10:19,854 --> 00:10:22,414
that you can be the next big thing
in our industry.

169
00:10:23,374 --> 00:10:25,374
Reality can't trap you

170
00:10:25,614 --> 00:10:26,814
and your ambitions.

171
00:10:28,934 --> 00:10:31,174
I still remember how you looked like

172
00:10:31,174 --> 00:10:32,974
when you first joined the academy.

173
00:10:33,653 --> 00:10:34,533
If I'm not mistaken,

174
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,174
you were the freshman representative.

175
00:10:37,374 --> 00:10:39,614
I had a deep impression

176
00:10:39,854 --> 00:10:41,333
of your speech.

177
00:10:42,374 --> 00:10:44,254
From your speech,

178
00:10:44,494 --> 00:10:46,013
I can feel

179
00:10:47,054 --> 00:10:48,093
your passion

180
00:10:49,174 --> 00:10:50,854
for medicine.

181
00:10:52,494 --> 00:10:53,533
Don't let it go to waste.

182
00:10:57,494 --> 00:10:58,614
Thank you, Mr Wu.

183
00:11:08,054 --> 00:11:09,133
You can exert more strength.

184
00:11:10,814 --> 00:11:11,974
-Here?
-Yeah.

185
00:11:12,974 --> 00:11:14,213
Is it too painful for you?

186
00:11:14,854 --> 00:11:16,734
No. It's just nice.

187
00:11:16,734 --> 00:11:17,615
It's okay, right?

188
00:11:18,054 --> 00:11:20,614
Tou Tou, you're using too much strength.

189
00:11:20,814 --> 00:11:21,653
Show me some mercy.

190
00:11:22,614 --> 00:11:23,482
I know.

191
00:11:24,974 --> 00:11:25,893
Not bad at all.

192
00:11:25,934 --> 00:11:26,814
Senior Uncle is here.

193
00:11:27,414 --> 00:11:28,614
Hello, everyone.

194
00:11:28,693 --> 00:11:30,174
Hello, Ms Dong.

195
00:11:30,573 --> 00:11:31,734
This place is pretty good.

196
00:11:32,854 --> 00:11:35,133
Not only can we study here
and provide diagnoses,

197
00:11:35,174 --> 00:11:36,814
but we can also learn from Ms Dong.

198
00:11:37,533 --> 00:11:40,614
I think I should hold a class here
tomorrow.

199
00:11:40,974 --> 00:11:42,453
I'll lie on the bed

200
00:11:42,573 --> 00:11:43,533
during the technique class.

201
00:11:44,174 --> 00:11:48,854
Tou Tou, apply pressure
onto his temple exterior.

202
00:11:49,854 --> 00:11:51,294
It dredges his emotions.

203
00:11:52,494 --> 00:11:55,133
He's always worried about
our country and its people.

204
00:11:55,213 --> 00:11:57,814
I'm sure his circulation is terrible.

205
00:11:58,054 --> 00:11:58,888
Okay.

206
00:11:58,974 --> 00:11:59,888
Tou Tou,

207
00:12:00,254 --> 00:12:02,254
give your senior uncle a massage

208
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:03,653
when there's space.

209
00:12:03,653 --> 00:12:04,453
Okay.

210
00:12:04,453 --> 00:12:06,054
Unfortunately,
I can't accept your offer.

211
00:12:06,254 --> 00:12:07,533
I brought someone here.

212
00:12:07,734 --> 00:12:09,453
I have something to tell you too.

213
00:12:09,653 --> 00:12:10,614
Who did you bring?

214
00:12:15,294 --> 00:12:16,185
Mr Ren.

215
00:12:19,414 --> 00:12:20,374
Li Quan, you're back?

216
00:12:21,494 --> 00:12:23,213
-So, you could tell?
-Good.

217
00:12:23,294 --> 00:12:25,453
Go and get changed.

218
00:12:25,653 --> 00:12:27,494
You two can practice

219
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:29,773
on any empty beds.

220
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,974
How is Li Quan's family issue?

221
00:12:35,974 --> 00:12:37,294
It's fine now. I've resolved it.

222
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,130
Everything's fine now.

223
00:12:39,854 --> 00:12:41,614
You're his mentor.

224
00:12:41,614 --> 00:12:43,013
He's closer to you.

225
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:43,943
Of course.

226
00:12:44,414 --> 00:12:46,093
Whenever I see him,

227
00:12:47,254 --> 00:12:49,013
I'm reminded of the past me.

228
00:12:49,614 --> 00:12:51,093
I will do my best to help him.

229
00:12:51,414 --> 00:12:52,247
Yeah.

230
00:12:52,374 --> 00:12:53,174
There's one thing.

231
00:12:53,974 --> 00:12:55,333
You have to attend

232
00:12:55,494 --> 00:12:57,533
this year's alumni reunion.

233
00:12:58,854 --> 00:13:01,453
I never attended it before.
It'll be the same this year.

234
00:13:01,893 --> 00:13:03,734
I knew you would say that.

235
00:13:03,734 --> 00:13:04,614
Let's forget about the past.

236
00:13:04,614 --> 00:13:05,814
This year is different.

237
00:13:05,974 --> 00:13:07,854
This year, it's
the female student leader

238
00:13:07,854 --> 00:13:09,093
of our class.

239
00:13:09,213 --> 00:13:10,734
Do you remember?
She was the elite student in our class.

240
00:13:10,734 --> 00:13:11,893
The key is,

241
00:13:12,533 --> 00:13:13,494
I heard

242
00:13:13,974 --> 00:13:17,734
that she managed to contact Little Lark.

243
00:13:19,854 --> 00:13:21,333
My father had a girlfriend

244
00:13:23,533 --> 00:13:24,773
named Little Lark.

245
00:13:26,934 --> 00:13:27,833
You slipped?

246
00:13:28,254 --> 00:13:29,294
Be careful.

247
00:13:29,414 --> 00:13:30,614
Wait, you...

248
00:13:30,614 --> 00:13:31,734
My bones are fragile.

249
00:13:33,093 --> 00:13:34,893
The cloth was too slippery.

250
00:13:36,374 --> 00:13:37,614
There's a high chance she'll show up.

251
00:13:42,174 --> 00:13:43,052
I'll go.

252
00:13:44,294 --> 00:13:45,169
It's decided then.

253
00:13:45,614 --> 00:13:47,533
Just press the link

254
00:13:47,533 --> 00:13:49,333
inside the group chat
and you'll register your name.

255
00:13:51,254 --> 00:13:52,054
Alright, goodbye.

256
00:13:52,734 --> 00:13:53,934
Take care, Senior Uncle.

257
00:13:53,934 --> 00:13:54,810
Okay.

258
00:13:57,533 --> 00:13:58,494
Alright, that's enough.

259
00:13:59,854 --> 00:14:00,732
What's the matter?

260
00:14:05,734 --> 00:14:06,599
Go into

261
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,054
my office

262
00:14:08,054 --> 00:14:09,333
and bring me my phone.

263
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:10,494
-I'll check the group.
-It's okay.

264
00:14:10,494 --> 00:14:11,614
I'll do it for you later.

265
00:14:11,693 --> 00:14:13,133
Stay out of this. I'll do it myself.

266
00:14:13,814 --> 00:14:14,755
Go now.

267
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:15,974
Do you even know how to do it?

268
00:14:17,174 --> 00:14:18,060
Just go already.

269
00:14:20,054 --> 00:14:21,054
You're leaving already?

270
00:14:21,174 --> 00:14:22,254
I have something to do at the academy.

271
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:23,193
I'll come back next time.

272
00:14:24,814 --> 00:14:26,054
-Senior Uncle.
-Tian Zhen.

273
00:14:32,934 --> 00:14:33,974
What did Wu Shan Dao

274
00:14:34,414 --> 00:14:36,174
arrange for you again?

275
00:14:36,174 --> 00:14:37,093
An alumni reunion.

276
00:14:38,133 --> 00:14:39,494
-Alumni reunion?
-Yeah.

277
00:14:39,653 --> 00:14:40,974
I thought you never attended it?

278
00:14:42,934 --> 00:14:44,254
I've graduated for 30 years.

279
00:14:44,734 --> 00:14:45,614
I have to go.

280
00:14:49,213 --> 00:14:50,494
Let me tell you something.

281
00:14:51,573 --> 00:14:52,773
-Don't go.
-Tou Tou.

282
00:14:54,414 --> 00:14:55,411
Come.

283
00:14:57,213 --> 00:14:58,138
Come here.

284
00:14:59,734 --> 00:15:00,773
Distribute these to them.

285
00:15:08,894 --> 00:15:09,779
Get back to work.

286
00:15:17,093 --> 00:15:18,005
Class Leader,

287
00:15:18,614 --> 00:15:20,533
my phone kept ringing.

288
00:15:21,133 --> 00:15:22,614
Can I answer it first?

289
00:15:27,054 --> 00:15:27,982
Hello?

290
00:15:28,374 --> 00:15:29,174
Le Le's Mum,

291
00:15:29,254 --> 00:15:30,614
will you be picking Le Le up today?

292
00:15:30,614 --> 00:15:31,734
Or will his grandmother pick him up?

293
00:15:33,614 --> 00:15:34,734
Isn't his grandmother there?

294
00:15:39,974 --> 00:15:40,934
Le Le.

295
00:15:40,934 --> 00:15:41,854
That was fun.

296
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:42,854
-Mum.
-Ms Zhang.

297
00:15:42,974 --> 00:15:43,911
Your mother is here.

298
00:15:45,854 --> 00:15:47,494
Sorry for the wait.

299
00:15:48,054 --> 00:15:49,093
I think there was a miscommunication

300
00:15:49,093 --> 00:15:50,333
between me and his grandmother.

301
00:15:50,374 --> 00:15:51,174
It's fine.

302
00:15:51,174 --> 00:15:52,893
I called his grandmother,
but she didn't pick up.

303
00:15:52,934 --> 00:15:54,374
I thought it was an emergency.

304
00:15:54,374 --> 00:15:55,614
That's why I contacted you.

305
00:15:55,814 --> 00:15:56,700
Is that so?

306
00:15:56,814 --> 00:15:58,734
I'll try to call her then.

307
00:15:58,734 --> 00:15:59,552
Okay.

308
00:16:05,414 --> 00:16:07,814
Doctor, my husband is old.

309
00:16:07,814 --> 00:16:10,054
Please arrange a bed for him.

310
00:16:10,054 --> 00:16:11,814
Please take care of us.

311
00:16:12,734 --> 00:16:14,254
What if he catches a cold?

312
00:16:14,814 --> 00:16:15,771
Doctor!

313
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:22,254
-Hello.
-Le Le's granny.

314
00:16:22,974 --> 00:16:24,893
I thought you were supposed
to pick Le Le up today?

315
00:16:25,254 --> 00:16:26,294
Why aren't you here?

316
00:16:26,294 --> 00:16:28,814
Le Le's grandpa was caught
in a car accident

317
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:29,934
when he was buying shrimp for him.

318
00:16:29,934 --> 00:16:31,294
(I'm at the hospital right now.)

319
00:16:31,814 --> 00:16:33,734
I'll leave Le Le to you today.

320
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:35,614
Was it serious?

321
00:16:35,614 --> 00:16:36,653
He took an X-ray scan.

322
00:16:36,653 --> 00:16:38,814
They said he has a hip fracture
and that he has to be hospitalized.

323
00:16:39,414 --> 00:16:40,341
However,

324
00:16:40,614 --> 00:16:41,494
there's no vacant bed right now.

325
00:16:41,494 --> 00:16:42,734
I'm waiting for one.

326
00:16:42,974 --> 00:16:44,773
If so, I'll bring Le Le to visit him,

327
00:16:44,814 --> 00:16:45,654
okay?

328
00:16:45,912 --> 00:16:46,762
Don't.

329
00:16:46,854 --> 00:16:47,734
Don't come here.

330
00:16:47,734 --> 00:16:49,254
(Le Le's father is on a business trip.)

331
00:16:49,254 --> 00:16:50,494
(I'm alone at the hospital.)

332
00:16:50,494 --> 00:16:52,614
If you guys come, I have no way

333
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:54,294
to take care of you guys.

334
00:16:54,294 --> 00:16:56,533
Don't come here. Just bring Le Le home.

335
00:16:56,854 --> 00:16:58,294
(Okay. I'll hang up now.)

336
00:16:58,294 --> 00:16:59,224
(I'm hanging up.)

337
00:17:09,254 --> 00:17:10,653
I'll find one for you.

338
00:17:13,174 --> 00:17:14,374
Hello, Xia?

339
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:17,254
Can you do me a favour?

340
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:36,254
What's wrong?

341
00:17:36,374 --> 00:17:37,263
Is it Meng Meng?

342
00:17:38,254 --> 00:17:39,934
Just tell me if you want
to check my phone.

343
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,414
Who wants to check your phone?

344
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:44,174
You look dejected.

345
00:17:44,294 --> 00:17:45,974
Did something happen to Meng Meng?
What's wrong?

346
00:17:47,174 --> 00:17:49,213
She has stopped contacting me
after she went home.

347
00:17:49,213 --> 00:17:50,854
She hasn't even replied to my messages.

348
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:54,708
Are you disappointed?

349
00:17:55,013 --> 00:17:56,213
I'm just worried about her.

350
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:57,494
What are you worried about?

351
00:17:58,854 --> 00:17:59,802
Her parents.

352
00:18:05,734 --> 00:18:07,054
Say, don't tell me her parents

353
00:18:07,054 --> 00:18:09,054
have put her under surveillance again?

354
00:18:10,667 --> 00:18:11,583
Grandson,

355
00:18:11,854 --> 00:18:13,133
I have a wonderful plan.

356
00:18:13,734 --> 00:18:14,614
Do you wish to hear me out?

357
00:18:17,734 --> 00:18:18,583
Tell me then.

358
00:18:18,854 --> 00:18:19,794
Let's exchange our secrets.

359
00:18:20,854 --> 00:18:21,833
What secret?

360
00:18:22,653 --> 00:18:23,536
It's about your father.

361
00:18:25,414 --> 00:18:26,255
Little Lark.

362
00:18:32,854 --> 00:18:33,763
No way.

363
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,414
How could you be like this?

364
00:18:36,814 --> 00:18:37,814
You're not willing to sacrifice
your father's woman

365
00:18:37,814 --> 00:18:39,173
for your woman's sake.

366
00:18:39,254 --> 00:18:40,813
Moreover, she's not even your mother.

367
00:18:40,933 --> 00:18:42,293
Who are you calling my woman?

368
00:18:43,134 --> 00:18:44,134
Why do I have no idea?

369
00:18:45,213 --> 00:18:46,083
Listen.

370
00:18:46,894 --> 00:18:48,813
After Wu Shan Dao
told your father about her,

371
00:18:49,293 --> 00:18:51,374
he took his phone immediately.

372
00:18:51,374 --> 00:18:52,614
I thought

373
00:18:52,654 --> 00:18:53,529
something was off.

374
00:18:54,053 --> 00:18:55,453
I think you might be right.

375
00:18:55,494 --> 00:18:57,134
What has Little Lark got to do
with Dad scrolling his phone?

376
00:18:59,254 --> 00:19:00,614
It's none of your business.
It's a long story.

377
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:02,374
Anyway,

378
00:19:02,534 --> 00:19:04,173
if you tell me about Little Lark,

379
00:19:04,254 --> 00:19:05,134
I'll tell you

380
00:19:05,213 --> 00:19:06,614
how to take Meng Meng out.

381
00:19:06,974 --> 00:19:08,053
Tell me how to take her out first.

382
00:19:08,254 --> 00:19:09,974
If it does work out,
I'll tell you immediately.

383
00:19:10,053 --> 00:19:11,413
Alright, I'll go ahead then.

384
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:13,213
-Deal?
-Deal.

385
00:19:15,374 --> 00:19:17,134
Your grandfather has a habit
of drinking Summer Solstice soup

386
00:19:17,254 --> 00:19:19,134
during Summer Solstice, right?

387
00:19:19,213 --> 00:19:20,894
We can use that excuse
to hold a gathering.

388
00:19:21,534 --> 00:19:22,654
With that as an excuse,

389
00:19:22,734 --> 00:19:24,134
her parents can't do anything about it.

390
00:19:24,293 --> 00:19:27,254
This way, we can take Meng Meng out,

391
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:28,325
am I right?

392
00:19:31,134 --> 00:19:32,053
Summer Solstice?

393
00:19:32,993 --> 00:19:33,857
I'm smart, right?

394
00:19:33,894 --> 00:19:35,854
I would've forgotten about it
had you not reminded me.

395
00:19:37,774 --> 00:19:39,213
It's in two days.

396
00:19:39,254 --> 00:19:40,894
You're really smart.

397
00:19:40,894 --> 00:19:41,833
Hey! Ren Tian Zhen!

398
00:19:42,573 --> 00:19:44,654
Don't touch my precious head
with your filthy hand!

399
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,663
(Jiangzhou People's Hospital)

400
00:19:47,774 --> 00:19:49,974
Do you feel much better
after lying down?

401
00:19:50,213 --> 00:19:51,107
Am I right?

402
00:19:51,534 --> 00:19:52,974
Look at this ward.

403
00:19:52,974 --> 00:19:54,453
This is ridiculous.

404
00:19:54,734 --> 00:19:55,734
My goodness.

405
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:57,534
You mustn't move.

406
00:19:57,614 --> 00:19:59,293
-What are you doing here?
-It's okay now.

407
00:19:59,614 --> 00:20:01,614
Where's Le Le?
Do you leave him at home?

408
00:20:01,614 --> 00:20:02,494
Of course not.

409
00:20:02,494 --> 00:20:03,774
He's at my best friend's place.

410
00:20:03,774 --> 00:20:04,573
Don't worry.

411
00:20:05,494 --> 00:20:06,534
How's his grandfather?

412
00:20:06,854 --> 00:20:07,763
Le Le's Mum,

413
00:20:08,053 --> 00:20:09,213
sorry for the trouble.

414
00:20:09,774 --> 00:20:10,894
Don't move!

415
00:20:11,654 --> 00:20:13,173
You're so talkative.

416
00:20:13,374 --> 00:20:15,854
Are there no double rooms
or triple rooms here?

417
00:20:16,134 --> 00:20:17,254
This ward is too cramped.

418
00:20:17,254 --> 00:20:18,894
We can't even fit a camp bed in here.

419
00:20:18,894 --> 00:20:20,134
What will you do tonight?

420
00:20:20,854 --> 00:20:21,894
Who knows?

421
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:24,093
Let's get through the afternoon first.

422
00:20:25,774 --> 00:20:27,813
Follow the doctor's instructions.
You can only take liquid food today.

423
00:20:28,413 --> 00:20:29,497
There's gauze here.

424
00:20:31,093 --> 00:20:32,614
Alright now. Stop crying.

425
00:20:46,374 --> 00:20:47,374
Hello, Mr Ren?

426
00:20:48,534 --> 00:20:49,374
Can you please

427
00:20:49,413 --> 00:20:50,813
do me a favour?

428
00:20:51,014 --> 00:20:52,774
It hurts! I want to go home!

429
00:20:52,774 --> 00:20:54,213
-Okay, thank you.
-I want to go home!

430
00:20:54,213 --> 00:20:55,413
Over here. Bed 37.

431
00:20:55,413 --> 00:20:56,374
I want to go home!

432
00:20:56,534 --> 00:20:57,813
I don't want all of this!

433
00:20:57,813 --> 00:20:59,534
-Le Le's granny.
-I want to go home!

434
00:20:59,974 --> 00:21:01,374
I want to go home!

435
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:02,774
I want to go home!

436
00:21:03,134 --> 00:21:04,293
I want to go home!

437
00:21:08,654 --> 00:21:10,333
This ward is much better.

438
00:21:11,894 --> 00:21:13,654
There's no one using this bed here.

439
00:21:14,374 --> 00:21:16,134
If you're tired,

440
00:21:16,134 --> 00:21:17,254
you can rest here tonight.

441
00:21:19,093 --> 00:21:19,974
I've already inquired about a caretaker.

442
00:21:20,014 --> 00:21:20,974
They have caretakers here.

443
00:21:21,053 --> 00:21:22,534
I'll find one for you later.

444
00:21:22,693 --> 00:21:23,894
You can have your food in the canteen.

445
00:21:24,014 --> 00:21:25,974
I've already booked
one week's worth of meal for you.

446
00:21:26,293 --> 00:21:27,333
If you have to stay here,

447
00:21:27,413 --> 00:21:28,453
you can ask the caretaker or the nurse

448
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:29,453
to take your meal for you.

449
00:21:33,614 --> 00:21:34,534
I'll get some hot water.

450
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:35,958
Ying,

451
00:21:36,173 --> 00:21:37,413
thank you.

452
00:21:37,654 --> 00:21:38,534
Don't move.

453
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:40,254
There's no need to be courteous.

454
00:21:40,534 --> 00:21:41,591
It's what I should do.

455
00:21:43,014 --> 00:21:45,120
I told you not to move. Stop talking.

456
00:21:46,654 --> 00:21:48,654
Your daughter-in-law is really nice.

457
00:21:50,854 --> 00:21:52,254
She's my ex-daughter-in-law.

458
00:21:52,453 --> 00:21:54,573
My son already divorced her.

459
00:21:55,173 --> 00:21:56,293
Ex-daughter-in-law?

460
00:21:56,494 --> 00:21:57,413
She's being so nice to you

461
00:21:57,413 --> 00:21:58,534
even after getting a divorce?

462
00:21:58,894 --> 00:22:01,134
Is there something wrong with your son?

463
00:22:02,494 --> 00:22:03,774
She's just afraid

464
00:22:04,014 --> 00:22:05,734
that I might take custody
of my grandson.

465
00:22:05,734 --> 00:22:07,654
That's why she's doing this.

466
00:22:08,573 --> 00:22:10,014
Old madam,

467
00:22:10,413 --> 00:22:11,293
listen.

468
00:22:11,654 --> 00:22:13,014
Even if you do engage her in court,

469
00:22:13,014 --> 00:22:14,494
you won't get custody of your grandson.

470
00:22:14,654 --> 00:22:15,774
Do you know your status?

471
00:22:15,894 --> 00:22:17,374
You're his grandmother.

472
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,482
But her?

473
00:22:18,693 --> 00:22:20,134
She's his biological mother.

474
00:22:20,134 --> 00:22:21,774
She was helping you out,

475
00:22:22,173 --> 00:22:24,374
yet you're badmouthing her right now.

476
00:22:25,014 --> 00:22:25,894
You're something else.

477
00:22:26,374 --> 00:22:27,614
What's the reason then?

478
00:22:27,774 --> 00:22:29,413
She's our ex-daughter-in-law.

479
00:22:29,813 --> 00:22:31,134
Why do you think

480
00:22:31,134 --> 00:22:32,053
she's trying

481
00:22:32,213 --> 00:22:33,254
to help us out?

482
00:22:39,374 --> 00:22:40,374
Here's your hot water.

483
00:22:42,053 --> 00:22:43,374
I even bought you a new towel.

484
00:22:45,534 --> 00:22:47,093
If you guys need anything else,

485
00:22:47,173 --> 00:22:48,413
you can call me anytime.

486
00:22:50,974 --> 00:22:52,293
Le Le is still young.

487
00:22:52,614 --> 00:22:54,053
He can't do anything
to help you guys out.

488
00:22:54,734 --> 00:22:56,093
I'm just trying
to fulfil his filial duties

489
00:22:56,093 --> 00:22:57,293
on his behalf.

490
00:22:58,894 --> 00:22:59,919
I'll make a move first.

491
00:23:06,534 --> 00:23:09,654
You have no idea how fortunate you are.

492
00:23:09,854 --> 00:23:10,654
Yeah.

493
00:23:11,293 --> 00:23:13,453
You're taking it for granted.

494
00:23:14,014 --> 00:23:15,134
Stop talking.

495
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:35,539
(Qibo Medical Centre)

496
00:23:38,134 --> 00:23:39,083
Is this it?

497
00:23:43,974 --> 00:23:45,293
This just came in this morning.

498
00:23:45,293 --> 00:23:46,333
It's the real deal.

499
00:23:50,894 --> 00:23:53,093
I smell the wind, the fire,

500
00:23:54,293 --> 00:23:55,213
and the rain.

501
00:24:00,654 --> 00:24:02,053
Do you smell the ice,

502
00:24:02,534 --> 00:24:03,505
the snow,

503
00:24:03,813 --> 00:24:04,693
and the smell of dusk too?

504
00:24:05,494 --> 00:24:07,494
Hong, you do know me the best.

505
00:24:11,254 --> 00:24:12,169
What are we waiting for then?

506
00:24:12,614 --> 00:24:14,134
I will handle this medicine myself.

507
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:15,293
This is the closest I've been

508
00:24:15,293 --> 00:24:17,093
to such unnatural phenomena.

509
00:24:18,734 --> 00:24:19,693
Let me join you.

510
00:24:20,014 --> 00:24:21,014
The drugstore is my territory.

511
00:24:21,497 --> 00:24:22,404
Wait.

512
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:24,614
Are you guys truly going
to make Jian Xi drink this?

513
00:24:24,774 --> 00:24:26,014
Of course.

514
00:24:26,654 --> 00:24:27,654
Do you know how much effort

515
00:24:27,854 --> 00:24:29,774
all of us have spent to find them?

516
00:24:29,774 --> 00:24:30,700
Yeah.

517
00:24:31,854 --> 00:24:32,774
Of course we'll use it.

518
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,374
Li Quan, let's go.

519
00:24:38,053 --> 00:24:38,943
Let's go.

520
00:24:40,974 --> 00:24:42,173
I'll go and take a look.

521
00:24:42,534 --> 00:24:43,435
Me too.

522
00:24:43,974 --> 00:24:45,494
Mr Ren,

523
00:24:45,494 --> 00:24:46,614
what kind of container do we need
to immerse this tile

524
00:24:46,614 --> 00:24:48,293
and is there anything
we should take note of?

525
00:24:49,494 --> 00:24:50,894
How dare you ask me that?

526
00:24:51,014 --> 00:24:52,654
Did you learn nothing after so long?

527
00:24:54,774 --> 00:24:57,014
Anyway, plastic containers

528
00:24:57,014 --> 00:24:58,734
and stainless steel basins
are out of the question.

529
00:24:58,734 --> 00:25:00,654
In which era did this formula
originate from?

530
00:25:02,213 --> 00:25:03,173
Enamel.

531
00:25:03,654 --> 00:25:05,053
I think we should use a wooden pail.

532
00:25:05,173 --> 00:25:07,134
I think that's the safest way.

533
00:25:09,134 --> 00:25:10,494
Wait. Well,

534
00:25:10,854 --> 00:25:11,894
what about the boys' urine?

535
00:25:12,534 --> 00:25:13,654
Don't look at me.

536
00:25:16,854 --> 00:25:17,794
Why are you staring at me?

537
00:25:21,654 --> 00:25:22,505
Wait.

538
00:25:23,053 --> 00:25:25,534
Why are you staring at me?
Do I look like a boy?

539
00:25:25,534 --> 00:25:26,614
Wait.

540
00:25:26,614 --> 00:25:28,173
It's not that you look like a boy.

541
00:25:28,173 --> 00:25:28,997
Tou Tou.

542
00:25:29,614 --> 00:25:31,413
We need to look for a boy.

543
00:25:31,413 --> 00:25:32,494
I know that.

544
00:25:32,494 --> 00:25:33,854
Of course I know that.

545
00:25:33,854 --> 00:25:36,534
I'm just telling you three to gather it.

546
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:38,093
-Understood?
-Yeah.

547
00:25:38,093 --> 00:25:39,374
Come on, let's go.

548
00:25:39,374 --> 00:25:40,654
Put it here. Yeah.

549
00:25:40,654 --> 00:25:41,494
Let's hurry.

550
00:25:41,494 --> 00:25:42,293
Come on.

551
00:25:42,293 --> 00:25:43,254
Remember, we need boys' urine.

552
00:25:44,534 --> 00:25:45,544
Okay?

553
00:25:46,374 --> 00:25:48,693
Select your subjects carefully.

554
00:25:48,734 --> 00:25:49,716
Okay.

555
00:25:58,413 --> 00:26:00,134
We're honest people.
Why are you closing the door?

556
00:26:00,774 --> 00:26:02,254
I'm doing this for your sake.

557
00:26:02,654 --> 00:26:03,774
If news of this gets out,

558
00:26:03,774 --> 00:26:04,774
your reputation will be ruined.

559
00:26:04,774 --> 00:26:05,654
Nonsense.

560
00:26:09,014 --> 00:26:09,813
Master.

561
00:26:11,774 --> 00:26:12,734
Fine, I'll tell you.

562
00:26:12,734 --> 00:26:14,374
You can choose whether you want to
close it after hearing me out.

563
00:26:17,014 --> 00:26:18,614
Madam Jiang found
the 300-year-old tiles.

564
00:26:18,654 --> 00:26:19,615
She brought them back.

565
00:26:19,854 --> 00:26:21,213
Peng Shi Yan is in front of the toilet,

566
00:26:21,333 --> 00:26:22,534
waiting to collect boys' urine.

567
00:26:28,374 --> 00:26:29,374
I think we should close it.

568
00:26:30,494 --> 00:26:31,894
I told you already.

569
00:26:56,534 --> 00:26:57,734
Are you sure they're 300 years old?

570
00:26:59,774 --> 00:27:01,413
Madam Jiang was amazing.

571
00:27:01,654 --> 00:27:02,854
She found them in
an intangible cultural heritage village.

572
00:27:03,199 --> 00:27:04,137
They're 300 years old.

573
00:27:10,654 --> 00:27:11,693
Here's a copy of the certificate.

574
00:27:25,254 --> 00:27:26,254
Here's the second certificate.

575
00:27:30,734 --> 00:27:32,494
Madam Jiang brought them
to an accrediting body

576
00:27:33,333 --> 00:27:35,534
as she was afraid
nobody would believe her.

577
00:27:35,534 --> 00:27:37,014
They had verified the tile.

578
00:27:40,254 --> 00:27:41,374
By the way,

579
00:27:41,894 --> 00:27:43,014
Madam Jiang even recorded a video

580
00:27:43,014 --> 00:27:44,213
just in case you didn't believe her.

581
00:27:44,774 --> 00:27:46,374
Do you want more? Here.

582
00:27:57,254 --> 00:27:58,614
How much did she spend on them?

583
00:27:58,614 --> 00:27:59,654
She didn't spend a single cent.

584
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:03,654
With her silver tongue,

585
00:28:03,854 --> 00:28:05,734
she managed to convince the people

586
00:28:07,254 --> 00:28:08,173
to give them to her for free.

587
00:28:09,413 --> 00:28:11,413
Madam Jiang

588
00:28:12,413 --> 00:28:14,333
is truly amazing.

589
00:28:22,774 --> 00:28:25,654
This is 300 years old, huh?

590
00:28:26,494 --> 00:28:28,014
If we knew she was going to find them,

591
00:28:29,134 --> 00:28:30,734
I would've told her to
bring all of them back

592
00:28:30,734 --> 00:28:32,014
for us to reassemble them

593
00:28:32,173 --> 00:28:33,173
ourselves.

594
00:28:34,173 --> 00:28:35,813
Our medical centre will be considered
an intangible cultural heritage too.

595
00:28:39,654 --> 00:28:40,854
Yeah.

596
00:28:41,734 --> 00:28:42,654
Look at the tile...

597
00:28:44,654 --> 00:28:45,854
Sober up.

598
00:28:45,894 --> 00:28:47,413
Is that even the point here?

599
00:28:48,173 --> 00:28:49,053
What should we do?

600
00:28:50,053 --> 00:28:51,005
What should we do?

601
00:28:53,854 --> 00:28:55,374
You're my master. Why are you asking me?

602
00:28:55,494 --> 00:28:56,654
Of course I'm asking you.

603
00:28:57,014 --> 00:28:58,134
You have plenty of tricks
up your sleeves.

604
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:00,293
I don't know Chinese medicine.

605
00:29:00,413 --> 00:29:01,774
How can I dupe them?

606
00:29:02,774 --> 00:29:05,014
You're my master. You should
have more tricks up your sleeves.

607
00:29:13,014 --> 00:29:14,374
Say, how can we

608
00:29:15,894 --> 00:29:17,134
grind this tile?

609
00:29:20,374 --> 00:29:21,774
Of course you have

610
00:29:21,774 --> 00:29:22,854
to use a machine.

611
00:29:23,374 --> 00:29:25,053
But we have to immerse it
in urine for 21 days.

612
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:27,053
If we grind it with a machine,

613
00:29:27,534 --> 00:29:29,053
I don't think

614
00:29:31,134 --> 00:29:32,254
we can use the machine again.

615
00:29:38,854 --> 00:29:39,854
You're smiling?

616
00:29:41,854 --> 00:29:43,014
You can still smile?

617
00:29:44,654 --> 00:29:46,053
Is the machine even the point here?

618
00:29:47,534 --> 00:29:48,813
Do you know what's at stake here?

619
00:29:49,374 --> 00:29:50,734
Your act

620
00:29:50,734 --> 00:29:51,974
will be exposed soon.

621
00:29:51,974 --> 00:29:53,413
-Everyone...
-Lower your volume.

622
00:29:53,413 --> 00:29:54,654
Everyone is out there.

623
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:57,014
They're so excited about it.

624
00:29:57,254 --> 00:29:58,693
They wish to witness a miracle.

625
00:29:58,974 --> 00:30:00,614
Instead of coming up with a solution,

626
00:30:01,254 --> 00:30:02,173
you're actually smiling here?

627
00:30:02,285 --> 00:30:03,232
What should we do then?

628
00:30:04,014 --> 00:30:05,534
Why are you asking me again?

629
00:30:05,654 --> 00:30:07,614
Even if you ask me, do you think
I can come up with a solution?

630
00:30:09,854 --> 00:30:11,374
If I must say,

631
00:30:12,734 --> 00:30:14,374
you shouldn't have lied to them
in the first place.

632
00:30:14,374 --> 00:30:15,453
Enough.

633
00:30:15,894 --> 00:30:17,654
Quit the useless chatter.

634
00:30:26,254 --> 00:30:27,208
Let's do it your way.

635
00:30:33,374 --> 00:30:34,374
We can swap out the tile
for another one.

636
00:30:35,614 --> 00:30:36,774
But what about the smell?

637
00:30:37,134 --> 00:30:39,293
We need a tile that's been immersed
in urine for 21 days.

638
00:30:39,413 --> 00:30:40,453
How can I find something like that?

639
00:30:41,374 --> 00:30:42,254
That's easy.

640
00:30:43,413 --> 00:30:44,693
I'll add some Wulingzhi.

641
00:30:51,654 --> 00:30:52,630
Understood.

642
00:30:57,654 --> 00:30:58,638
Be careful.

643
00:31:38,734 --> 00:31:40,134
You should leave.
I can handle this myself.

644
00:31:40,254 --> 00:31:41,614
How could you handle this yourself?

645
00:31:41,654 --> 00:31:43,134
I'm here to help you out.

646
00:31:43,774 --> 00:31:45,894
The stench is too strong.

647
00:31:45,894 --> 00:31:47,774
-That's fine.
-I can bear the stench alone.

648
00:31:47,774 --> 00:31:49,894
You guys can leave.

649
00:31:50,254 --> 00:31:51,247
Wait.

650
00:31:51,654 --> 00:31:52,614
You shouldn't spill it.

651
00:31:53,374 --> 00:31:54,654
Look at the time.

652
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:56,333
What if many patients

653
00:31:56,374 --> 00:31:57,413
come in at this time

654
00:31:57,413 --> 00:31:58,654
while you guys stay here

655
00:31:58,654 --> 00:31:59,734
without doing anything?

656
00:31:59,774 --> 00:32:00,774
That's pointless.

657
00:32:00,854 --> 00:32:01,693
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

658
00:32:01,693 --> 00:32:02,614
Tou Tou is right.

659
00:32:03,173 --> 00:32:05,494
I should brew Jian Xi's medicine.

660
00:32:05,573 --> 00:32:06,494
You guys can resume your work.

661
00:32:06,894 --> 00:32:08,813
-Go ahead.
-Ms Xia, I'll stay. Don't worry.

662
00:32:09,254 --> 00:32:10,134
Hey,

663
00:32:10,134 --> 00:32:11,014
we should go.

664
00:32:11,053 --> 00:32:13,293
Only Sun Tou Tou can handle
folk remedies like these.

665
00:32:13,293 --> 00:32:14,374
Ms Xia, don't worry.

666
00:32:14,494 --> 00:32:15,453
Master's formula is here.

667
00:32:15,614 --> 00:32:16,453
She won't try anything funny.

668
00:32:16,894 --> 00:32:17,716
Let's go.

669
00:32:17,774 --> 00:32:18,693
No way!

670
00:32:19,093 --> 00:32:19,974
This will decide if I can still

671
00:32:19,974 --> 00:32:21,854
believe in the scientific view
that I had formed before.

672
00:32:22,014 --> 00:32:23,093
I cannot rest at ease

673
00:32:23,093 --> 00:32:25,413
without experiencing this myself.

674
00:32:25,614 --> 00:32:26,560
Fine!

675
00:32:27,774 --> 00:32:28,974
Class Leader can stay.

676
00:32:29,173 --> 00:32:30,374
Ms Xia, is that okay?

677
00:32:30,654 --> 00:32:32,774
Alright. Tou Tou,
I'll leave this to you.

678
00:32:32,774 --> 00:32:33,771
Ms Xia, don't worry.

679
00:32:35,774 --> 00:32:36,622
Don't worry.

680
00:32:38,374 --> 00:32:39,453
Go and close the door.

681
00:32:40,134 --> 00:32:41,083
Okay.

682
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:51,122
Let's begin.

683
00:32:52,894 --> 00:32:53,774
Before we begin,

684
00:32:53,774 --> 00:32:55,093
I have something to tell you.

685
00:32:56,614 --> 00:32:58,854
You must promise that
you'll keep it a secret.

686
00:33:07,014 --> 00:33:07,974
It's like this.

687
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,145
(Meng Meng)

688
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:04,026
(Are you there?)

689
00:34:10,854 --> 00:34:11,774
So,

690
00:34:12,974 --> 00:34:14,134
you have to cooperate with me

691
00:34:14,134 --> 00:34:15,854
and swap out the ingredients.

692
00:34:17,854 --> 00:34:19,894
I knew TCM practitioners
were just quack doctors.

693
00:34:20,014 --> 00:34:20,894
Lower your volume.

694
00:34:23,494 --> 00:34:24,534
This is the only time we're doing it.

695
00:34:25,654 --> 00:34:26,614
Even so, you guys are lying.

696
00:34:26,854 --> 00:34:28,014
What will we do about
Jian Xi and her mother

697
00:34:28,134 --> 00:34:29,177
if we keep up the act?

698
00:34:30,374 --> 00:34:31,614
They're expecting this
to save them, you know?

699
00:34:33,014 --> 00:34:34,974
No, I have to tell them the truth.

700
00:34:34,974 --> 00:34:35,896
Go ahead then!

701
00:34:36,654 --> 00:34:38,614
Tell Jian Xi and Ms Xia

702
00:34:38,614 --> 00:34:40,053
that there's no hope for her.

703
00:34:40,894 --> 00:34:42,413
Tell her that she'll remain like that
for the rest of her life.

704
00:34:44,093 --> 00:34:45,974
Go ahead.
I wanted to tell them long ago.

705
00:34:46,453 --> 00:34:48,213
I held it in for too long.

706
00:34:49,854 --> 00:34:51,453
Do you think I want this to happen?

707
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,745
Go ahead then.

708
00:34:52,774 --> 00:34:54,134
I'll admit it. Alright.

709
00:34:54,134 --> 00:34:55,053
Go and tell them.

710
00:35:13,254 --> 00:35:15,774
You see, no matter if we're
TCM practitioners or Western doctors,

711
00:35:17,614 --> 00:35:18,894
we still have compassion.

712
00:35:22,014 --> 00:35:23,734
You can't bear to
tell them the truth, right?

713
00:35:28,734 --> 00:35:30,734
We had no choice but to do this.

714
00:35:32,093 --> 00:35:35,734
Do you know that Jian Xi might have
starved herself to death long ago

715
00:35:35,734 --> 00:35:37,293
if we didn't resort to this?

716
00:35:38,173 --> 00:35:40,134
It's terrifying when people lose hope.

717
00:35:42,573 --> 00:35:44,734
What if Jian Xi's condition
doesn't improve after taking this?

718
00:35:44,853 --> 00:35:45,893
She will try to take
her own life too, right?

719
00:35:45,974 --> 00:35:47,693
Yes. But Master said

720
00:35:47,734 --> 00:35:49,294
that life is just like climbing hills.

721
00:35:50,653 --> 00:35:52,173
After we climb one,

722
00:35:52,853 --> 00:35:53,933
we'll face the next one.

723
00:35:55,334 --> 00:35:56,413
However, we need to think of a way

724
00:35:56,413 --> 00:35:58,120
to climb the hill we encounter first.

725
00:35:59,334 --> 00:36:00,560
After that, we can think about the next.

726
00:36:10,173 --> 00:36:12,173
I'll only do this once.
This won't happen again.

727
00:36:12,574 --> 00:36:13,574
I promise.

728
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,440
(Summer Solstice represents
the coming of hot weather.)

729
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:26,274
(Due to that, there's a saying)

730
00:36:26,631 --> 00:36:30,120
(that states the weather isn't hot
before the passing of Summer Solstice.)

731
00:36:31,013 --> 00:36:34,598
(Summer Solstice is also one of the
Four Seasons and Eight Solar Terms.)

732
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:42,235
(Summer Solstice)

733
00:36:52,373 --> 00:36:53,427
Master,

734
00:36:53,774 --> 00:36:56,814
why must we take this soup
during Summer Solstice?

735
00:36:56,814 --> 00:36:57,774
The weather is hot enough.

736
00:36:59,334 --> 00:37:02,254
This is the Summer Solstice soup.

737
00:37:02,893 --> 00:37:04,254
Within a year,

738
00:37:04,534 --> 00:37:06,613
there are two important solar terms.

739
00:37:06,613 --> 00:37:09,014
The first is Summer Solstice.
The second is Winter Solstice.

740
00:37:10,574 --> 00:37:11,853
These two days

741
00:37:11,853 --> 00:37:14,933
signify the changing of Yin and Yang.

742
00:37:15,133 --> 00:37:18,213
And, it's especially important to men.

743
00:37:18,373 --> 00:37:21,294
People like us, who prefer soup,

744
00:37:21,494 --> 00:37:25,094
usually take Summer Solstice soup

745
00:37:25,094 --> 00:37:26,173
and Winter Solstice soup.

746
00:37:26,173 --> 00:37:28,413
So, how will it benefit me?

747
00:37:29,173 --> 00:37:30,373
Let me give you an example.

748
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:31,534
If our lives

749
00:37:31,974 --> 00:37:33,774
are just like

750
00:37:33,774 --> 00:37:35,334
a lamp,

751
00:37:35,334 --> 00:37:37,734
if we consume the Summer Solstice
and Winter Solstice soup,

752
00:37:38,294 --> 00:37:40,574
we'll be adding oil to our lamp.

753
00:37:43,774 --> 00:37:46,294
You said it was good for men.

754
00:37:46,494 --> 00:37:48,494
So, there's no benefit for women?

755
00:37:49,014 --> 00:37:49,893
Of course it has benefits for us.

756
00:37:50,413 --> 00:37:52,814
You see, adult women like us

757
00:37:53,173 --> 00:37:54,094
will experience

758
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:57,133
an opening and closing process
every month.

759
00:37:57,653 --> 00:38:01,534
Therefore, there are actually more
opportunities for us to recuperate

760
00:38:01,534 --> 00:38:03,254
compared to men.

761
00:38:05,334 --> 00:38:06,413
I don't think that's right.

762
00:38:07,173 --> 00:38:09,574
I think it's the same for both genders.

763
00:38:09,574 --> 00:38:11,574
I read this once in a book.

764
00:38:11,734 --> 00:38:14,413
Sow in spring, develop in summer,
harvest in fall, and store in winter.

765
00:38:14,534 --> 00:38:15,435
Actually,

766
00:38:15,974 --> 00:38:18,334
each day consists of
an opening and a closing process.

767
00:38:18,494 --> 00:38:20,494
As long as we cherish the opportunity,

768
00:38:20,734 --> 00:38:24,334
we can recuperate every day.

769
00:38:27,094 --> 00:38:28,294
Tou Tou

770
00:38:28,613 --> 00:38:30,254
is truly one of the smartest girls

771
00:38:30,893 --> 00:38:32,534
I've seen.

772
00:38:35,774 --> 00:38:37,294
She's pretty talented.

773
00:38:37,574 --> 00:38:39,173
She always challenges your master too.

774
00:38:39,961 --> 00:38:40,888
And, she wins quite often.

775
00:38:44,094 --> 00:38:45,254
Better late than never.

776
00:38:45,294 --> 00:38:46,177
Bottoms up.

777
00:38:48,734 --> 00:38:49,613
It's hot.

778
00:38:49,814 --> 00:38:51,413
What time did you sleep last night?

779
00:38:51,734 --> 00:38:52,853
Didn't you sleep together with me?

780
00:38:59,814 --> 00:39:01,254
Do you forget?

781
00:39:02,494 --> 00:39:04,734
We slept after

782
00:39:04,734 --> 00:39:05,814
coming back from that.

783
00:39:05,814 --> 00:39:07,613
What do you mean?

784
00:39:10,534 --> 00:39:12,494
Let's have some watermelon.

785
00:39:12,613 --> 00:39:14,173
-You guys won't understand.
-Remember.

786
00:39:14,814 --> 00:39:16,334
Watermelon is also known as

787
00:39:16,774 --> 00:39:19,014
the White Tiger Decoction.

788
00:39:19,494 --> 00:39:20,413
Do you know

789
00:39:20,413 --> 00:39:21,534
what ingredients are in there?

790
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:22,951
-I do.
-Tell me.

791
00:39:23,653 --> 00:39:25,334
It contains

792
00:39:25,334 --> 00:39:28,613
gypsum, common anemarrhena,
Japonica rice, and licorice.

793
00:39:29,014 --> 00:39:31,373
Do you know its effect then?

794
00:39:31,373 --> 00:39:32,373
It serves to relieve heatiness.

795
00:39:33,014 --> 00:39:33,974
However, what does it

796
00:39:33,974 --> 00:39:36,014
have to do with watermelon?

797
00:39:36,294 --> 00:39:37,974
Because it's summer.

798
00:39:37,974 --> 00:39:40,334
Summer is hot.

799
00:39:40,613 --> 00:39:42,254
During summer, everyone will

800
00:39:42,294 --> 00:39:44,613
stay in air-conditioned rooms,
take cold drinks,

801
00:39:44,613 --> 00:39:46,774
wear shorts, and stay bare-footed.

802
00:39:47,373 --> 00:39:50,169
A few days ago, Peng Shi Yan told me

803
00:39:50,453 --> 00:39:51,974
that modern people

804
00:39:52,774 --> 00:39:55,373
no longer live in hunger and cold.

805
00:39:55,814 --> 00:39:56,734
He's wrong.

806
00:39:57,294 --> 00:39:58,574
Modern people

807
00:39:59,254 --> 00:40:01,974
catch cold more easily
compared to our predecessors.

808
00:40:04,094 --> 00:40:05,334
Especially during summer.

809
00:40:06,014 --> 00:40:07,853
Summer is the season of growth.

810
00:40:08,133 --> 00:40:09,453
What's wrong with sweating?

811
00:40:10,014 --> 00:40:13,094
Modern people don't work in fields.

812
00:40:13,334 --> 00:40:15,534
They just hide inside
their air-conditioned room all the time.

813
00:40:16,094 --> 00:40:18,774
Some of them might be young,

814
00:40:19,054 --> 00:40:21,373
but they have a Dowager's Hump.

815
00:40:21,494 --> 00:40:23,574
Do you know what's a Dowager's Hump?

816
00:40:26,254 --> 00:40:28,334
When our predecessors
worked in the fields,

817
00:40:28,974 --> 00:40:31,173
the coldness in their bodies
would be dispelled through sweating.

818
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:35,413
If they were going to
suffer from heatstroke,

819
00:40:35,413 --> 00:40:38,213
they would be fine
after taking some watermelon.

820
00:40:39,294 --> 00:40:40,653
Only landowners

821
00:40:40,653 --> 00:40:42,014
enjoy the fanning service

822
00:40:42,574 --> 00:40:43,853
provided by their maids.

823
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:46,014
The coldness couldn't be dispelled.

824
00:40:47,574 --> 00:40:50,653
Thus, all of the coldness
accumulate on the Dazhui point.

825
00:40:51,413 --> 00:40:53,653
That is known as a Dowager's Hump.

826
00:40:54,014 --> 00:40:56,893
If you don't want
a painful period or headaches,

827
00:40:57,734 --> 00:41:00,173
you have to take note of it.

828
00:41:01,094 --> 00:41:02,213
You must make sure
you don't catch a cold.

829
00:41:03,974 --> 00:41:06,254
If you have a stomach ache,

830
00:41:06,254 --> 00:41:09,334
that means your lower energizer
is blocked off.

831
00:41:09,334 --> 00:41:12,893
You shouldn't keep wearing
low-cut socks like these.

832
00:41:13,534 --> 00:41:16,574
You must wear long socks
that can cover your Sanyinjiao.

833
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:18,094
But it's summer.

834
00:41:18,094 --> 00:41:19,413
It's hot if you don't wear

835
00:41:19,853 --> 00:41:21,213
short socks like these.

836
00:41:22,014 --> 00:41:24,334
It's hot because the Yang energy
doesn't combine with the Yin energy.

837
00:41:25,334 --> 00:41:27,014
The Yang energy
is floating on the surface.

838
00:41:27,534 --> 00:41:29,653
As long as you retain the Yang energy,

839
00:41:29,853 --> 00:41:31,173
once the Yang energy
combines with the Yin energy,

840
00:41:31,173 --> 00:41:33,853
your body temperature will rise slowly.

841
00:41:34,133 --> 00:41:36,534
When your base body temperature
has been increased,

842
00:41:36,613 --> 00:41:39,334
your body won't feel hot

843
00:41:39,574 --> 00:41:42,094
even if the surrounding is 0.5°C hotter.

844
00:41:42,373 --> 00:41:43,263
Okay.

845
00:41:45,173 --> 00:41:46,574
I guess our watermelon is wasted.

846
00:41:48,413 --> 00:41:49,334
You should consume less.

847
00:41:50,094 --> 00:41:50,974
Does that mean I can still consume it?

848
00:41:50,974 --> 00:41:52,453
-Yeah
-But just a little.

849
00:41:54,413 --> 00:41:55,693
Let me try it.

850
00:42:07,574 --> 00:42:08,974
Why aren't you letting us see her?

851
00:42:09,814 --> 00:42:11,693
We can't just allow our child
to do whatever she wants.

852
00:42:13,133 --> 00:42:14,173
It's our fault

853
00:42:14,173 --> 00:42:15,574
for spoiling her.

854
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:18,014
She's different from other children.
You guys can't treat her like this.

855
00:42:18,094 --> 00:42:19,413
That's why I don't want my child

856
00:42:19,413 --> 00:42:20,693
to stay sick forever.

857
00:42:20,774 --> 00:42:22,133
She was fine when
she was living with us.

858
00:42:22,133 --> 00:42:23,613
Why is she acting like this
after returning home then?

859
00:42:23,693 --> 00:42:24,774
She's 18 years old.

860
00:42:24,774 --> 00:42:26,494
It's inappropriate for her
to stay outside all the time.

861
00:42:26,494 --> 00:42:27,388
Mr Xu,

862
00:42:28,334 --> 00:42:29,373
let me give you a reminder.

863
00:42:30,133 --> 00:42:32,014
You're holding her captive here.
I can call the cops on you.

864
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,002
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

865
00:42:36,113 --> 00:42:37,409
(are referenced from relevant
traditional Chinese medicine books)

866
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,120
