1
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,280
Dinner is served.

2
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,453
Sir, don't you think I'm considerate?

3
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,637
Grandpa, I said

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,280
I didn't want to eat.

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,240
Look at you.

6
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,120
You're not eating or drinking.

7
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,960
And, you're in a terrible mood.

8
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,680
You're sick.

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,680
I'm not.

10
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,040
When I say you're sick,
you're definitely sick.

11
00:00:33,766 --> 00:00:35,246
I'm experienced.

12
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,740
You're lovesick.

13
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,520
So, you fancy someone, huh?

14
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,726
How could you relate this to that?

15
00:00:44,107 --> 00:00:45,153
This sucks.

16
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,480
Since you didn't deny it,
I guess it must be true then.

17
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,000
-Is it her?
-Who?

18
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,040
That girl.

19
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,640
Stop guessing.

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You're wrong.

21
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,800
Fine, let me ask you this then.

22
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,320
Did you not confess to her?

23
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,080
Does she know your feelings for her?

24
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,440
I understand now.

25
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,520
You're afraid that your mother
will disagree.

26
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,960
I don't need to be afraid.

27
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,800
She'll definitely disagree.

28
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,997
Enough, let's drop the topic.

29
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,400
Come and have dinner.

30
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,560
Have it while it's hot.

31
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,597
Tou Tou kept the best for you.

32
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,600
These are pork ribs.

33
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,877
She even got you a bottle of yogurt.

34
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,277
It's a balanced meal.

35
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,717
You shouldn't

36
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:36,840
waste her effort.

37
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,720
Come on.

38
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,640
At least she still has a conscience.

39
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,520
Come on.

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,840
Okay.

41
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,160
Look at you.

42
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,080
You're not young,
and you come from a great background.

43
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,920
But you don't want

44
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,597
to find a suitable partner

45
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,400
and bring her back.

46
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,560
I guess I'm a lousy person.

47
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,637
I won't allow you to say that
about yourself.

48
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,640
You're a kind child.

49
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,320
Remember the girl

50
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,080
you fancied last time?

51
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,680
Alright, I'll stop.

52
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,440
To be honest,

53
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,720
your mother

54
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,837
is difficult to convince.

55
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,717
You have to find someone

56
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,877
of equal background.

57
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,720
Am I getting married?
Or is she getting married?

58
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,440
How can you get married
if you go against her will?

59
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,520
I'll stay single then.

60
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,360
I've fished out some information
from your beloved grandson.

61
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,080
It's that girl.

62
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,440
Ling Lan

63
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,480
will never accept this.

64
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,440
Nobody can accept this.

65
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,197
Can Ling Lan stop being picky?

66
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,360
If this keeps up,

67
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,800
my grandson will stay single forever.

68
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,920
What's wrong with being single?

69
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,600
It's not like we have a throne
for him to inherit.

70
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,080
But...

71
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,285
It's been a long time since you sang.

72
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,920
Seems like you're in a great mood today.

73
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,480
Here, let me add some hot water.

74
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,800
Lift your feet.

75
00:03:56,126 --> 00:03:58,403
Contact Mr Tu tomorrow

76
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,680
and arrange for a meal.

77
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,000
Tell him to take Ming Mou along.

78
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,637
I suggest you

79
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,197
ask for your son's opinion first.

80
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,960
If he doesn't cooperate,

81
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,560
you'll be buying a meal for nothing.

82
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,000
We're just having a meal with his uncle.

83
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,560
I'll tell him.

84
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,120
I'm not going!

85
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,320
It's been a long time since we met.

86
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,160
It's just a meal.

87
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,640
Can't you just cooperate with me?

88
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,877
Mum, I know exactly

89
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,237
what you're up to.

90
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,400
I already have someone in my heart.
You can forget about it.

91
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,960
If so, you can keep her inside
your heart until she suffocates.

92
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,880
(Grain Buds signifies
the coming of summer.)

93
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,000
(Summer crops are abundant,
but not ready to be harvested yet.)

94
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,520
(Thus, it is known as Grain Buds.)

95
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,040
(During Grain Buds,
rain increases gradually.)

96
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,440
(With a plain diet,
we control our desires.)

97
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,440
(Grain Buds)

98
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,240
Li Quan, you're here.

99
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,360
Mr Wu.

100
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,840
Were you looking for me?

101
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,960
Have a seat.

102
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,157
Have a seat.

103
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,280
Long time no see.

104
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,840
I heard

105
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,800
that it's been over a month
since you applied for leave.

106
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,560
Are you still working as a foot masseur
in the foot reflexology shop?

107
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,120
Are you facing financial difficulties?

108
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,360
There's nothing embarrassing about that.

109
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,037
Listen.

110
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,037
I was poorer than you

111
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,160
when I was your age.

112
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,477
Back then, I was

113
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,280
utterly broke.

114
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,360
I didn't dare to confess
to the girl I fancied

115
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,560
as I was afraid that I'd be rejected.

116
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,960
I was afraid that
I might drag her down with me.

117
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,760
But I was thinking to myself,

118
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,840
if you truly

119
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,520
have a larger financial demand,

120
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,120
working as a foot masseur

121
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,160
isn't going to work out
for you in the long run.

122
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,800
I was thinking that
I should introduce you

123
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,160
to be a pharmaceutical rep.

124
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,240
You'll work under Mr Zheng,
who's cooperating with our academy.

125
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,880
I'm close to him.

126
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,197
I took you there before.

127
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,680
You met him too, right?

128
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,240
I'll contact him.

129
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,640
What do you think?

130
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,800
Do you have any concerns?

131
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,360
Mr Wu,

132
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,640
my brother got into
the town's high school.

133
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,520
We have to spend a lot
on his education fees.

134
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,000
And now, my father is
bedridden due to rheumatism.

135
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,520
I'm the sole breadwinner of the family.

136
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,520
Thank you for your kind offer.

137
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,077
However, I don't think I'll do well

138
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,360
as a pharmaceutical rep.

139
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,640
I'm different from Tian Zhen
and the rest.

140
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,717
I don't have any resources

141
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,440
or connections in this city.

142
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,920
I don't think I can
reach my sales target.

143
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,520
Don't worry.

144
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,037
I know poor students like us

145
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,520
don't have any connections.

146
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,240
But we can fight for it,

147
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,560
am I right?

148
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,760
There's no free lunch in the world.

149
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,840
You see, for a man,

150
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,800
no matter

151
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:18,280
if he's born with a silver spoon or not,

152
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,160
he has to rely on himself to succeed.

153
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,400
Connections are nothing.

154
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,360
If you learn how to sweet talk

155
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,037
and be hard-working,

156
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,080
you can build connections easily.

157
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,280
Don't worry.

158
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,040
However, I have one piece
of advice for you.

159
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,117
I hope you won't become

160
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,880
a full-time pharmaceutical rep.

161
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,960
You have to spare some time

162
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,640
for your studies too.

163
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,357
I trust you.

164
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,717
I also believe

165
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,360
that you can be the next big thing
in our industry.

166
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,320
Reality can't trap you

167
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,760
and your ambitions.

168
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,037
I still remember how you looked like

169
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,920
when you first joined the academy.

170
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,120
If I'm not mistaken,
you were the freshman representative.

171
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,560
I had a deep impression

172
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,280
of your speech.

173
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,200
From your speech,

174
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,960
I can feel

175
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,040
your passion

176
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,800
for medicine.

177
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,480
Don't let it go to waste.

178
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,560
Thank you, Mr Wu.

179
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,080
You can exert more strength.

180
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,920
-Here?
-Yeah.

181
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,160
Is it too painful for you?

182
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,597
No. It's just nice.

183
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,560
It's okay, right?

184
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,560
Tou Tou, you're using too much strength.

185
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,600
Show me some mercy.

186
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,440
I know.

187
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,797
Not bad at all.

188
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,760
Senior Uncle is here.

189
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,557
Hello, everyone.

190
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,120
Hello, Ms Dong.

191
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,680
This place is pretty good.

192
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,037
Not only can we study here
and provide diagnoses,

193
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,760
but we can also learn from Ms Dong.

194
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,560
I think I should hold a class here
tomorrow.

195
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,400
I'll lie on the bed

196
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,480
during the technique class.

197
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,800
Tou Tou, apply pressure
onto his temple exterior.

198
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,240
It dredges his emotions.

199
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,077
He's always worried about
our country and its people.

200
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,760
I'm sure his circulation is terrible.

201
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,837
Okay.

202
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,840
Tou Tou,

203
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,117
give your senior uncle a massage

204
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,517
when there's space.

205
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,436
Okay.

206
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,119
Unfortunately,
I can't accept your offer.

207
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,480
I brought someone here.

208
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,400
I have something to tell you too.

209
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,560
Who did you bring?

210
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,120
Mr Ren.

211
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,320
Li Quan, you're back?

212
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,157
-So, you could tell?
-Good.

213
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,400
Go and get changed.

214
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,440
You two can practice

215
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,720
on any empty beds.

216
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,837
How is Li Quan's family issue?

217
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,240
It's fine now. I've resolved it.

218
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,080
Everything's fine now.

219
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,477
You're his mentor.

220
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,917
He's closer to you.

221
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,880
Of course.

222
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,040
Whenever I see him,

223
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,960
I'm reminded of the past me.

224
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,040
I will do my best to help him.

225
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,200
Yeah.

226
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,120
There's one thing.

227
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,280
You have to attend

228
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,480
this year's alumni reunion.

229
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,400
I never attended it before.
It'll be the same this year.

230
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,597
I knew you would say that.

231
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,477
Let's forget about the past.

232
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,760
This year is different.

233
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,717
This year, it's
the female student leader

234
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,040
of our class.

235
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,597
Do you remember?
She was the elite student in our class.

236
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,840
The key is,

237
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,440
I heard

238
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:42,680
that she managed to contact Little Lark.

239
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,280
My father had a girlfriend

240
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,720
named Little Lark.

241
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,760
You slipped?

242
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,240
Be careful.

243
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,477
Wait, you...

244
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,680
My bones are fragile.

245
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,840
The cloth was too slippery.

246
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,560
There's a high chance she'll show up.

247
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,000
I'll go.

248
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,120
It's decided then.

249
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,397
Just press the link

250
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,280
inside the group chat
and you'll register your name.

251
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,000
Alright, goodbye.

252
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,797
Take care, Senior Uncle.

253
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,760
Okay.

254
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,440
Alright, that's enough.

255
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,680
What's the matter?

256
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,520
Go into

257
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,917
my office

258
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,197
and bring me my phone.

259
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,357
-I'll check the group.
-It's okay.

260
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,557
I'll do it for you later.

261
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,080
Stay out of this. I'll do it myself.

262
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,680
Go now.

263
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,920
Do you even know how to do it?

264
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,000
Just go already.

265
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
You're leaving already?

266
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,197
I have something to do at the academy.

267
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,120
I'll come back next time.

268
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,000
-Senior Uncle.
-Tian Zhen.

269
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,920
What did Wu Shan Dao

270
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,037
arrange for you again?

271
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,040
An alumni reunion.

272
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,440
-Alumni reunion?
-Yeah.

273
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,920
I thought you never attended it?

274
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,200
I've graduated for 30 years.

275
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,560
I have to go.

276
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,440
Let me tell you something.

277
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,720
-Don't go.
-Tou Tou.

278
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,360
Come.

279
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,080
Come here.

280
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,720
Distribute these to them.

281
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,720
Get back to work.

282
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:42,960
Class Leader,

283
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,480
my phone kept ringing.

284
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,560
Can I answer it first?

285
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,920
Hello?

286
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,117
Le Le's Mum,

287
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,477
will you be picking Le Le up today?

288
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,680
Or will his grandmother pick him up?

289
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,680
Isn't his grandmother there?

290
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,797
Le Le.

291
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,800
That was fun.

292
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,800
-Mum.
-Ms Zhang.

293
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,840
Your mother is here.

294
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,440
Sorry for the wait.

295
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,957
I think there was a miscommunication

296
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,237
between me and his grandmother.

297
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,797
It's fine. I called his
grandmother, but she didn't pick up.

298
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,237
I thought it was an emergency.

299
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,560
That's why I contacted you.

300
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,640
Is that so?

301
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,597
I'll try to call her then.

302
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,480
Okay.

303
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,677
Doctor, my husband is old.

304
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,917
Please arrange a bed for him.

305
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,760
Please take care of us.

306
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,200
What if he catches a cold?

307
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,720
Doctor!

308
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,200
-Hello.
-Le Le's granny.

309
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,840
I thought you were supposed
to pick Le Le up today?

310
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,157
Why aren't you here?

311
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,717
Le Le's grandpa was caught
in a car accident

312
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,797
when he was buying shrimp for him.

313
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,240
(I'm at the hospital right now.)

314
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,680
I'll leave Le Le to you today.

315
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,477
Was it serious?

316
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,517
He took an X-ray scan.

317
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,760
They said he has a hip fracture
and that he has to be hospitalized.

318
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,280
However,

319
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,357
there's no vacant bed right now.

320
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,680
I'm waiting for one.

321
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,677
If so, I'll bring Le Le to visit him,

322
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,600
okay?

323
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,717
Don't.

324
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,597
Don't come here.

325
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,117
(Le Le's father is on a business trip.)

326
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,357
(I'm alone at the hospital.)

327
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,560
If you guys come, I have no way

328
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,157
to take care of you guys.

329
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,480
Don't come here. Just bring Le Le home.

330
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,157
(Okay. I'll hang up now.)

331
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,160
(I'm hanging up.)

332
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,600
I'll find one for you.

333
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,320
Hello, Xia?

334
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,200
Can you do me a favour?

335
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,200
What's wrong?

336
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,200
Is it Meng Meng?

337
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,880
Just tell me if you want
to check my phone.

338
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,357
Who wants to check your phone?

339
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,120
You look dejected.

340
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,920
Did something happen to Meng Meng?
What's wrong?

341
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,077
She has stopped contacting me
after she went home.

342
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,800
She hasn't even replied to my messages.

343
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,640
Are you disappointed?

344
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,160
I'm just worried about her.

345
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,440
What are you worried about?

346
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,760
Her parents.

347
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,917
Say, don't tell me her parents

348
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
have put her under surveillance again?

349
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,520
Grandson,

350
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,080
I have a wonderful plan.

351
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,560
Do you wish to hear me out?

352
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,520
Tell me then.

353
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,720
Let's exchange our secrets.

354
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,760
What secret?

355
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,480
It's about your father.

356
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,200
Little Lark.

357
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,720
No way.

358
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,360
How could you be like this?

359
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,677
You're not willing to sacrifice
your father's woman

360
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,117
for your woman's sake.

361
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,760
Moreover, she's not even your mother.

362
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,240
Who are you calling my woman?

363
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,080
Why do I have no idea?

364
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,040
Listen.

365
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,760
After Wu Shan Dao
told your father about her,

366
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,237
he took his phone immediately.

367
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,517
I thought

368
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,480
something was off.

369
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,357
I think you might be right.

370
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,080
What has Little Lark got to do
with Dad scrolling his phone?

371
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,560
It's none of your business.
It's a long story.

372
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,320
Anyway,

373
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,117
if you tell me about Little Lark,

374
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,077
I'll tell you

375
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,560
how to take Meng Meng out.

376
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,000
Tell me how to take her out first.

377
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,917
If it does work out,
I'll tell you immediately.

378
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,360
Alright, I'll go ahead then.

379
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,160
-Deal?
-Deal.

380
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,080
Your grandfather has a habit
of drinking Summer Solstice soup

381
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,077
during Summer Solstice, right?

382
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,840
We can use that excuse
to hold a gathering.

383
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,597
With that as an excuse,

384
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,080
her parents can't do anything about it.

385
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,200
This way, we can take Meng Meng out,

386
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,280
am I right?

387
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,000
Summer Solstice?

388
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,757
I'm smart, right?

389
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,800
I would've forgotten about it
had you not reminded me.

390
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,117
It's in two days.

391
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,757
You're really smart.

392
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,760
Hey! Ren Tian Zhen!

393
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,600
Don't touch my precious head
with your filthy hand!

394
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,600
(Jiangzhou People's Hospital)

395
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,920
Do you feel much better
after lying down?

396
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,040
Am I right?

397
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,837
Look at this ward.

398
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,400
This is ridiculous.

399
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,680
My goodness.

400
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,477
You mustn't move.

401
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,240
-What are you doing here?
-It's okay now.

402
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,477
Where's Le Le?
Do you leave him at home?

403
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,357
Of course not.

404
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,637
He's at my best friend's place.

405
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,520
Don't worry.

406
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,480
How's his grandfather?

407
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,720
Le Le's Mum,

408
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,160
sorry for the trouble.

409
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,840
Don't move!

410
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,120
You're so talkative.

411
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,800
Are there no double rooms
or triple rooms here?

412
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,117
This ward is too cramped.

413
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,757
We can't even fit a camp bed in here.

414
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,080
What will you do tonight?

415
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,840
Who knows?

416
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,040
Let's get through the afternoon first.

417
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,760
Follow the doctor's instructions.
You can only take liquid food today.

418
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,440
There's gauze here.

419
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,560
Alright now. Stop crying.

420
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,320
Hello, Mr Ren?

421
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,277
Can you please

422
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,760
do me a favour?

423
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,637
It hurts! I want to go home!

424
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,077
-Okay, thank you.
-I want to go home!

425
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,277
Over here. Bed 37.

426
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,320
I want to go home!

427
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,677
I don't want all of this!

428
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,480
-Le Le's granny.
-I want to go home!

429
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,320
I want to go home!

430
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,720
I want to go home!

431
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,240
I want to go home!

432
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,280
This ward is much better.

433
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,600
There's no one using this bed here.

434
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,997
If you're tired,

435
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,200
you can rest here tonight.

436
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:44,877
I've already inquired about a caretaker.

437
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,917
They have caretakers here.

438
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,480
I'll find one for you later.

439
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,840
You can have your food in the canteen.

440
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,920
I've already booked
one week's worth of meal for you.

441
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,277
If you have to stay here,

442
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,317
you can ask the caretaker or the nurse

443
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,400
to take your meal for you.

444
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,480
I'll get some hot water.

445
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:00,880
Ying,

446
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,360
thank you.

447
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,480
Don't move.

448
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,200
There's no need to be courteous.

449
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,520
It's what I should do.

450
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,080
I told you not to move. Stop talking.

451
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,600
Your daughter-in-law is really nice.

452
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,200
She's my ex-daughter-in-law.

453
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,520
My son already divorced her.

454
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,240
Ex-daughter-in-law?

455
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,277
She's being so nice to you

456
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,480
even after getting a divorce?

457
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,080
Is there something wrong with your son?

458
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,720
She's just afraid

459
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,597
that I might take custody
of my grandson.

460
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,600
That's why she's doing this.

461
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,960
Old madam,

462
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,240
listen.

463
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,877
Even if you do engage her in court,

464
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,440
you won't get custody of your grandson.

465
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,720
Do you know your status?

466
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,320
You're his grandmother.

467
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,440
But her?

468
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,997
She's his biological mother.

469
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,720
She was helping you out,

470
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,320
yet you're badmouthing her right now.

471
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,840
You're something else.

472
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,560
What's the reason then?

473
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,360
She's our ex-daughter-in-law.

474
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,997
Why do you think

475
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,000
she's trying

476
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,200
to help us out?

477
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,320
Here's your hot water.

478
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,320
I even bought you a new towel.

479
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,037
If you guys need anything else,

480
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,360
you can call me anytime.

481
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,240
Le Le is still young.

482
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,000
He can't do anything
to help you guys out.

483
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,957
I'm just trying
to fulfil his filial duties

484
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,240
on his behalf.

485
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,840
I'll make a move first.

486
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,600
You have no idea how fortunate you are.

487
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,600
Yeah.

488
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,400
You're taking it for granted.

489
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,080
Stop talking.

490
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:00,480
(Qibo Medical Centre)

491
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,040
Is this it?

492
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,157
This just came in this morning.

493
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,280
It's the real deal.

494
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,040
I smell the wind, the fire,

495
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,160
and the rain.

496
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,000
Do you smell the ice,

497
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,440
the snow,

498
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,640
and the smell of dusk too?

499
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,440
Hong, you do know me the best.

500
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,120
What are we waiting for then?

501
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,920
I will handle this medicine myself.

502
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,160
This is the closest I've been

503
00:22:40,241 --> 00:22:42,040
to such unnatural phenomena.

504
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,640
Let me join you.

505
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,960
The drugstore is my territory.

506
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,360
Wait.

507
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,560
Are you guys truly going
to make Jian Xi drink this?

508
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,960
Of course.

509
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,600
Do you know how much effort

510
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,637
all of us have spent to find them?

511
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,640
Yeah.

512
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,720
Of course we'll use it.

513
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,320
Li Quan, let's go.

514
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,880
Let's go.

515
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,120
I'll go and take a look.

516
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,360
Me too.

517
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,357
Mr Ren,

518
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,477
what kind of container do we need
to immerse this tile

519
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,240
and is there anything
we should take note of?

520
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,840
How dare you ask me that?

521
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,600
Did you learn nothing after so long?

522
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,877
Anyway, plastic containers

523
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,597
and stainless steel basins
are out of the question.

524
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,600
In which era did this formula
originate from?

525
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,120
Enamel.

526
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,000
I think we should use a wooden pail.

527
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,080
I think that's the safest way.

528
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,440
Wait. Well,

529
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,840
what about the boys' urine?

530
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,600
Don't look at me.

531
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,720
Why are you staring at me?

532
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,440
Wait.

533
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,397
Why are you staring at me?
Do I look like a boy?

534
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,477
Wait.

535
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,037
It's not that you look like a boy.

536
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:53,920
Tou Tou.

537
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,277
We need to look for a boy.

538
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,357
I know that.

539
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,717
Of course I know that.

540
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,397
I'm just telling you three to gather it.

541
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,957
-Understood?
-Yeah.

542
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,237
Come on, let's go.

543
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,517
Put it here. Yeah.

544
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,357
Let's hurry.

545
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,158
Come on.

546
00:24:07,241 --> 00:24:08,200
Remember, we need boys' urine.

547
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,480
Okay?

548
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,597
Select your subjects carefully.

549
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,640
Okay.

550
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,080
We're honest people.
Why are you closing the door?

551
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,200
I'm doing this for your sake.

552
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,637
If news of this gets out,

553
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,637
your reputation will be ruined.

554
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,600
Nonsense.

555
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,760
Master.

556
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,597
Fine, I'll tell you.

557
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,320
You can choose whether you want to
close it after hearing me out.

558
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,517
Madam Jiang found
the 300-year-old tiles.

559
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,560
She brought them back.

560
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,160
Peng Shi Yan is in front of the toilet,

561
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,480
waiting to collect boys' urine.

562
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,320
I think we should close it.

563
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,840
I told you already.

564
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,680
Are you sure they're 300 years old?

565
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,360
Madam Jiang was amazing.

566
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,800
She found them in
an intangible cultural heritage village.

567
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,080
They're 300 years old.

568
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,640
Here's a copy of the certificate.

569
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,200
Here's the second certificate.

570
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,440
Madam Jiang brought them
to an accrediting body

571
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,397
as she was afraid
nobody would believe her.

572
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,960
They had verified the tile.

573
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,320
By the way,

574
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:07,877
Madam Jiang even recorded a video

575
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,160
just in case you didn't believe her.

576
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,320
Do you want more? Here.

577
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,477
How much did she spend on them?

578
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,600
She didn't spend a single cent.

579
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,600
With her silver tongue,

580
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,680
she managed to convince the people

581
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,120
to give them to her for free.

582
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,360
Madam Jiang

583
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,280
is truly amazing.

584
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,600
This is 300 years old, huh?

585
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,960
If we knew she was going to find them,

586
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,597
I would've told her to
bring all of them back

587
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,960
for us to reassemble them

588
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,120
ourselves.

589
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,720
Our medical centre will be considered
an intangible cultural heritage too.

590
00:27:04,479 --> 00:27:05,679
Yeah.

591
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,908
Look at the tile...

592
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,757
Sober up.

593
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,360
Is that even the point here?

594
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,000
What should we do?

595
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,960
What should we do?

596
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,320
You're my master. Why are you asking me?

597
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,600
Of course I'm asking you.

598
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,080
You have plenty of tricks
up your sleeves.

599
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,240
I don't know Chinese medicine.

600
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,720
How can I dupe them?

601
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,960
You're my master. You should
have more tricks up your sleeves.

602
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,320
Say, how can we

603
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,080
grind this tile?

604
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,637
Of course you have

605
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,800
to use a machine.

606
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,000
But we have to immerse it
in urine for 21 days.

607
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,000
If we grind it with a machine,

608
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,000
I don't think

609
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,200
we can use the machine again.

610
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,800
You're smiling?

611
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,960
You can still smile?

612
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,000
Is the machine even the point here?

613
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,760
Do you know what's at stake here?

614
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,597
Your act

615
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,837
will be exposed soon.

616
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,277
-Everyone...
-Lower your volume.

617
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,600
Everyone is out there.

618
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,960
They're so excited about it.

619
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,640
They wish to witness a miracle.

620
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,560
Instead of coming up with a solution,

621
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,120
you're actually smiling here?

622
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,160
What should we do then?

623
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,480
Why are you asking me again?

624
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,560
Even if you ask me, do you think
I can come up with a solution?

625
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,320
If I must say,

626
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,237
you shouldn't have lied to them
in the first place.

627
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,400
Enough.

628
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,600
Quit the useless chatter.

629
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,160
Let's do it your way.

630
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,580
We can swap out the tile
for another one.

631
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,720
But what about the smell?

632
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,240
We need a tile that's been immersed
in urine for 21 days.

633
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,400
How can I find something like that?

634
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,200
That's easy.

635
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,640
I'll add some Wulingzhi.

636
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,560
Understood.

637
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,560
Be careful.

638
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,080
You should leave.
I can handle this myself.

639
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,517
How could you handle this yourself?

640
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,080
I'm here to help you out.

641
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,757
The stench is too strong.

642
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,637
-That's fine.
-I can bear the stench alone.

643
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,840
You guys can leave.

644
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,200
Wait.

645
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,560
You shouldn't spill it.

646
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,600
Look at the time.

647
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,237
What if many patients

648
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,277
come in at this time

649
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,517
while you guys stay here

650
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,637
without doing anything?

651
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,600
That's pointless.

652
00:30:25,684 --> 00:30:26,636
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

653
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,640
Tou Tou is right.

654
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,437
I should brew Jian Xi's medicine.

655
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,440
You guys can resume your work.

656
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,760
-Go ahead.
-Ms Xia, I'll stay. Don't worry.

657
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,917
Hey,
we should go.

658
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,157
Only Sun Tou Tou can handle
folk remedies like these.

659
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,320
Ms Xia, don't worry.

660
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,400
Master's formula is here.

661
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,400
She won't try anything funny.

662
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,637
Let's go.

663
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,640
No way!

664
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:44,837
This will decide if I can still

665
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,800
believe in the scientific view
that I had formed before.

666
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,957
I cannot rest at ease

667
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,360
without experiencing this myself.

668
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,520
Fine!

669
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,920
Class Leader can stay.

670
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,320
Ms Xia, is that okay?

671
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,637
Alright. Tou Tou,
I'll leave this to you.

672
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,720
Ms Xia, don't worry.

673
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,560
Don't worry.

674
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,400
Go and close the door.

675
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,040
Okay.

676
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,080
Let's begin.

677
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,040
Before we begin,
I have something to tell you.

678
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:24,033
You must promise that
you'll keep it a secret.

679
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,920
It's like this.

680
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,080
(Meng Meng)

681
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,960
(Are you there?)

682
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,720
So,

683
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,997
you have to cooperate with me

684
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,800
and swap out the ingredients.

685
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,840
I knew TCM practitioners
were just quack doctors.

686
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,840
Lower your volume.

687
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,480
This is the only time we're doing it.

688
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,560
Even so, you guys are lying.

689
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,960
What will we do about
Jian Xi and her mother

690
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,120
if we keep up the act?

691
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,560
They're expecting this
to save them, you know?

692
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,837
No, I have to tell them the truth.

693
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,840
Go ahead then!

694
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,477
Tell Jian Xi and Ms Xia

695
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,000
that there's no hope for her.

696
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,360
Tell her that she'll remain like that
for the rest of her life.

697
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,920
Go ahead.
I wanted to tell them long ago.

698
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,160
I held it in for too long.

699
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,400
Do you think I want this to happen?

700
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:17,637
Go ahead then.

701
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,997
I'll admit it. Alright.

702
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,000
Go and tell them.

703
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,720
You see, no matter if we're
TCM practitioners or Western doctors,

704
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,840
we still have compassion.

705
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,680
You can't bear to
tell them the truth, right?

706
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,680
We had no choice but to do this.

707
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:00,597
Do you know that Jian Xi might have
starved herself to death long ago

708
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,240
if we didn't resort to this?

709
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,080
It's terrifying when people lose hope.

710
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,680
What if Jian Xi's condition
doesn't improve after taking this?

711
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,837
She will try to take
her own life too, right?

712
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,597
Yes. But Master said

713
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,240
that life is just like climbing hills.

714
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,120
After we climb one,

715
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,880
we'll face the next one.

716
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,277
However, we need to think of a way

717
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,080
to climb the hill we encounter first.

718
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,520
After that, we can think about the next.

719
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,120
I'll only do this once.
This won't happen again.

720
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,520
I promise.

721
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,400
(Summer Solstice represents
the coming of hot weather.)

722
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:51,200
(Due to that, there's a saying)

723
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:55,080
(that states the weather isn't hot
before the passing of Summer Solstice.)

724
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:59,520
(Summer Solstice is also one of the
Four Seasons and Eight Solar Terms.)

725
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:07,160
(Summer Solstice)

726
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,360
Master,

727
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,677
why must we take this soup
during Summer Solstice?

728
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,720
The weather is hot enough.

729
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:27,200
This is the Summer Solstice soup.

730
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,200
Within a year,

731
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,477
there are two important solar terms.

732
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,960
The first is Summer Solstice.
The second is Winter Solstice.

733
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,717
These two days

734
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,880
signify the changing of Yin and Yang.

735
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:43,160
And, it's especially important to men.

736
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,240
People like us, who prefer soup,

737
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,957
usually take Summer Solstice soup

738
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,037
and Winter Solstice soup.

739
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,360
So, how will it benefit me?

740
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,237
Let me give you an example.

741
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,480
If our lives

742
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,637
are just like

743
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,197
a lamp,

744
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,680
if we consume the Summer Solstice
and Winter Solstice soup,

745
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,520
we'll be adding oil to our lamp.

746
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,240
You said it was good for men.

747
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,440
So, there's no benefit for women?

748
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,840
Of course it has benefits for us.

749
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,760
You see, adult women like us

750
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,307
will experience

751
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,080
an opening and closing process
every month.

752
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:26,397
Therefore, there are actually more
opportunities for us to recuperate

753
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,200
compared to men.

754
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,360
I don't think that's right.

755
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,437
I think it's the same for both genders.

756
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,520
I read this once in a book.

757
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:39,360
Sow in spring, develop in summer,
harvest in fall, and store in winter.

758
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,360
Actually,

759
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,280
each day consists of
an opening and a closing process.

760
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,440
As long as we cherish the opportunity,

761
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,280
we can recuperate every day.

762
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,240
Tou Tou

763
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,200
is truly one of the smartest girls

764
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,480
I've seen.

765
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,240
She's pretty talented.

766
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,120
She always challenges your master too.

767
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:05,840
And, she wins quite often.

768
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,157
Better late than never.

769
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,120
Bottoms up.

770
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,560
It's hot.

771
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,360
What time did you sleep last night?

772
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:17,800
Didn't you sleep together with me?

773
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,200
Do you forget?

774
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,597
We slept after

775
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,677
coming back from that.

776
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,560
What do you mean?

777
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,440
Let's have some watermelon.

778
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,120
-You guys won't understand.
-Remember.

779
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,280
Watermelon is also known as

780
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,960
the White Tiger Decoction.

781
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,277
Do you know

782
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,480
what ingredients are in there?

783
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,880
-I do.
-Tell me.

784
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,197
It contains

785
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,560
gypsum, common anemarrhena,
Japonica rice, and licorice.

786
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,237
Do you know its effect then?

787
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,320
It serves to relieve heatiness.

788
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:58,837
However, what does it

789
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,960
have to do with watermelon?

790
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,837
Because it's summer.

791
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:05,280
Summer is hot.

792
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,157
During summer, everyone will

793
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,477
stay in air-conditioned rooms,
take cold drinks,

794
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,720
wear shorts, and stay bare-footed.

795
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,120
A few days ago, Peng Shi Yan told me

796
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,920
that modern people

797
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:20,320
no longer live in hunger and cold.

798
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,680
He's wrong.

799
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,520
Modern people

800
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,920
catch cold more easily
compared to our predecessors.

801
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,280
Especially during summer.

802
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,800
Summer is the season of growth.

803
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,400
What's wrong with sweating?

804
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,040
Modern people don't work in fields.

805
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,480
They just hide inside
their air-conditioned room all the time.

806
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,720
Some of them might be young,

807
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,320
but they have a Dowager's Hump.

808
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,520
Do you know what's a Dowager's Hump?

809
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,280
When our predecessors
worked in the fields,

810
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,120
the coldness in their bodies
would be dispelled through sweating.

811
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,277
If they were going to
suffer from heatstroke,

812
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:03,160
they would be fine
after taking some watermelon.

813
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,517
Only landowners

814
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,960
enjoy the fanning service

815
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,800
provided by their maids.

816
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,960
The coldness couldn't be dispelled.

817
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:15,600
Thus, all of the coldness
accumulate on the Dazhui point.

818
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,600
That is known as a Dowager's Hump.

819
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,840
If you don't want
a painful period or headaches,

820
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:25,120
you have to take note of it.

821
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,160
You must make sure
you don't catch a cold.

822
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,117
If you have a stomach ache,

823
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,197
that means your lower energizer
is blocked off.

824
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:37,840
You shouldn't keep wearing
low-cut socks like these.

825
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,437
You must wear long socks
that can cover your Sanyinjiao.

826
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,957
But it's summer.

827
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,360
It's hot if you don't wear

828
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,160
short socks like these.

829
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,280
It's hot because the Yang energy
doesn't combine with the Yin energy.

830
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,960
The Yang energy
is floating on the surface.

831
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,600
As long as you retain the Yang energy,

832
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,037
once the Yang energy
combines with the Yin energy,

833
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,800
your body temperature will rise slowly.

834
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,477
When your base body temperature
has been increased,

835
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:04,280
your body won't feel hot

836
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:07,040
even if the surrounding
is 0.5 degree C hotter.

837
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,200
Okay.

838
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,520
I guess our watermelon is wasted.

839
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,425
You should consume less.

840
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:15,837
Does that mean I can still consume it?

841
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,400
-Yeah
-But just a little.

842
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,640
Let me try it.

843
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,920
Why aren't you letting us see her?

844
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,640
We can't just allow our child
to do whatever she wants.

845
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,037
It's our fault

846
00:40:39,121 --> 00:40:40,521
for spoiling her.

847
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,957
She's different from other children.
You guys can't treat her like this.

848
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,213
That's why I don't want my child

849
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,640
to stay sick forever.

850
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,920
She was fine when
she was living with us.

851
00:40:47,004 --> 00:40:48,556
Why is she acting like this
after returning home then?

852
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,637
She's 18 years old.

853
00:40:49,721 --> 00:40:51,436
It's inappropriate for her
to stay outside all the time.

854
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,400
Mr Xu,

855
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,320
let me give you a reminder.

856
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,960
You're holding her captive here.
I can call the cops on you.

857
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,957
(The prescriptions and remedies
used in this drama)

858
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,360
(are referenced from relevant
traditional Chinese medicine books)

859
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,040
