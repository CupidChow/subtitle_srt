Episode 16

3
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,700
The private warehouse is where the Lord of the Fuguo's heart is.

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,900
You are planning this behind my back.

5
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,100
If Lord of the Fuguo finds out,

6
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,300
he will kill you.

7
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,300
Lord Zhao Ying.

8
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,300
Lord Zhao Ying.

9
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,300
Please be careful.

10
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,100
I also hope that

11
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,500
I am the one planning this.

12
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:50,900
If it succeeds,

13
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,300
I will be able to

14
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,700
vent my anger.

15
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:54,700
However,

16
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,700
the private warehouse of Lord of the Fuguo

17
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,100
will be guarded by the soldiers.

18
00:00:58,900 --> 00:00:59,700
This gold warehouse

19
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,300
must be safe.

20
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:02,700
It is safe.

21
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,900
But the rumors about the gold warehouse

22
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,100
have spread all over the world.

23
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,100
It is hard to guess

24
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,100
the purpose of the person behind this.

25
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,500
Since it is a secret gold warehouse,

26
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:13,900
we should reveal the secret.

27
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,500
The gold warehouse is no longer safe.

28
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:17,100
We can only transfer it.

29
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:19,900
In the process of transferring,

30
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,700
there will be some accidents.

31
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:22,900
Am I right?

32
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,700
I see.

33
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,900
But even if we transfer it,

34
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,900
it will be hard to get it.

35
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:35,500
Why?

36
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:41,900
Since it is a private warehouse,

37
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,700
there must be some soldiers guarding it.

38
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,500
If we want to transfer it,

39
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,500
Lord Zhao Ying, think about it.

40
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,100
Such an important matter,

41
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,500
if Lord of the Fuguo

42
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,100
calls the guards to escort it,

43
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,100
who will dare to say it?

44
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,500
Isn't this clearly

45
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,100
against the whole Danning?

46
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,000
Your Majesty, you can just know it.

47
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,400
Don't make a fuss about it.

48
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,400
Just die.

49
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,000
I dare not.

50
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,400
After all,

51
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,400
I only have one life left.

52
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,800
What Lord Zhao Ying knows is

53
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,400
that I am willing to die.

54
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,600
You are right.

55
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,800
I am willing to die.

56
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,400
Lord Zhao Ying, please wait.

57
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I am guessing

58
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,800
that who will be the person

59
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,200
who will be responsible for the transfer

60
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,400
of such an important task?

61
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,600
But this time,

62
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,600
I don't trust anyone else.

63
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,600
How about

64
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,600
my son personally escorting

65
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,600
the guards to escort it?

66
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,800
What do you think?

67
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,400
You are so sweet.

68
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,600
I don't trust my son.

69
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,400
Just say it.

70
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,800
After all, in the capital,

71
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,800
only Lord Yi Lin can

72
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,200
fight against the guards.

73
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,000
I just

74
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,200
want to make a plan.

75
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,200
What if your men

76
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,400
also care about the private money in my hand?

77
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,600
You are joking.

78
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,000
Lord Yi Lin's duty is to protect the capital.

79
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,600
He won't do such a thing

80
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,000
as stealing private money.

81
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Okay.

82
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,600
It's settled.

83
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,200
My son will personally escort it

84
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,000
and transfer the private money to the bank.

85
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Of course, it's me.

86
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,000
But it's a serious matter.

87
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,200
I won't let it slip.

88
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,000
Otherwise, I will be burned.

89
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,400
Then I wish Lord Zhao Ying

90
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,000
everything goes well and he comes back safely.

91
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

92
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,800
If it's you,

93
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,000
it's better.

94
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,600
The auspicious time has come.

95
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,600
The sky is spinning.

96
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,400
Yin and Yang are in the state of state.

97
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,000
This is the auspicious time of the ceremony.

98
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,600
I would like to ask Your Majesty to make a move

99
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,400
to celebrate the future

100
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,400
and wish the state and people a safe and sound.

101
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,400
Lord Pei.

102
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,800
It's been two days.

103
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,200
Has His Majesty eaten?

104
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,100
No.

105
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,500
His Majesty is promising.

106
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,700
The world can see it.

107
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,500
Take some food for him in the middle of the night.

108
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,500
He's so promising.

109
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,900
I think it's a trap.

110
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,100
I'll try it on behalf of Lord Fu.

111
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:12,700
I understand.

112
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,100
Wait.

113
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,500
If he doesn't eat,

114
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,900
you have to put the food in.

115
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,100
Lord,

116
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,100
why is that?

117
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,700
It's a secret.

118
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:25,900
This matter willOW his Majesty.

119
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,500
His Majesty's bright side overcomes

120
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:54,800
the dark side.

121
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,200
I'm here to greet Your Majesty.

122
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,200
Your Majesty, please have a seat.

123
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,200
No one knows.

124
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,200
It's a secret.

125
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,200
Lin Zhen'an

126
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,200
Eat it.

127
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,200
No one knows.

128
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,200
It's you.

129
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:55,960
Calm your temper.

130
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,480
Even she has been fatuous,

131
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,520
it's enough

132
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,320
that His Majesty suffers Pvt. Pu.

133
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,760
If you say,

134
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,840
you too should be careful.

135
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,200
It's been three days.

136
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,080
Why hasn't she heard the pain?

137
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,560
Share the ashes with the child.

138
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,200
Among相俗之т 그다음

139
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:38,600
the child crosses his metal incorporating way with the stone.

140
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,200
What will he do?

141
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,600
It's none of your business.

142
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,240
Take away the tree

143
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,400
and put it into the window,

144
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,720
so it will appear more beautiful.

145
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:53,800
Wait.

146
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:55,840
Go.

147
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,000
Who is it?

148
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,160
By the order of the Lord of the Fuguo,

149
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,160
I'm here to collect the money for the disaster relief.

150
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,040
You're pretending to be the Lord of the Fuguo

151
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,640
and killing Wu She.

152
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,600
Lord Pei,

153
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,480
I'm telling the truth.

154
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,840
You'll see.

155
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,320
Brothers,

156
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,720
save the people!

157
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,840
Run!

158
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,080
Kill them!

159
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,360
Who did you hit?

160
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,040
Brothers,

161
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,160
it's the real Lord of the Fuguo.

162
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:45,640
Kill them!

163
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:47,840
Who dares to do that?

164
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,360
It's mine.

165
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,080
Kill them!

166
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:49,880
Kill them!

167
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,640
Why are there people here?

168
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,680
Stop!

169
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,360
Lord Pei,

170
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,400
they're refugees who lost their lives.

171
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,200
Did you kill them all?

172
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,400
By the order of the Lord of the Fuguo,

173
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,800
stop immediately!

174
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,040
Lord Pei,

175
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,600
the Lord of the Fuguo must have been blamed.

176
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,680
At least we should stop.

177
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,240
It's done.

178
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,080
I see.

179
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,960
Your Majesty, the prayer is done.

180
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,480
The Lord of the Fuguo

181
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,720
must be badly injured.

182
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,800
I think

183
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,960
he's in a critical situation.

184
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,120
See you, Your Majesty.

185
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,960
I'll take you back to the palace.

186
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,080
Who said I wanted to go back?

187
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,280
They didn't do anything wrong.

188
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,080
Since I obeyed the order,

189
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,560
I won't hurt the people of the Shouwu Village.

190
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,440
And I ordered them not to fight back.

191
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,080
I'll punish them

192
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,200
with a medicine.

193
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,200
I taught my men to protect the people.

194
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,000
It's not your turn to interfere.

195
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,120
No.

196
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,440
I've worked hard

197
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,760
to collect the money for 20 years.

198
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,840
How can you just

199
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,720
let the refugees take it?

200
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,240
I'll kill whoever I want today.

201
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,920
I'll see who dares to stop me.

202
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,120
Why should you fight back?

203
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,280
Working together

204
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,520
tentatively

205
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,800
for too long

206
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,320
is not a sign of good luck.

207
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:24,600
What aistance!

208
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:26,960
I think

209
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,320
we can go home immediately.

210
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,360
Leave here!

211
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:32,760
Leave now!

212
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,720
I've been waiting for you.

213
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,680
Who's sent you?

214
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,960
The gold was stolen.

215
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,640
It's the law that the Lord of the Guardian is not good at.

216
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,440
What?

217
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,320
But I didn't use the tiger talisman.

218
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,720
Who ordered

219
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,400
these Lord of the Guardian to do that?

220
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,560
It was the order of the High Priestess.

221
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,800
It doesn't matter.

222
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,600
It's just that

223
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,760
it's not proper for the High Priestess to call the Lord of the Guardian in private.

224
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,520
If she makes such a big fuss

225
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,480
and spread it,

226
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,400
I'm afraid it will be bad for your reputation.

227
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,120
Step aside.

228
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,320
Please forgive me, High Priestess.

229
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,560
I'm the Lord of this country.

230
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,520
I was punished without any crime.

231
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,680
I can't forgive you.

232
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,040
I'm going to kill someone today.

233
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,240
No one can stop me.

234
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,480
I hope this move

235
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,920
can make you laugh.

236
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,680
Go and call the doctor.

237
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,040
High Priestess,

238
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,280
I'm really thinking for you.

239
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,600
I didn't mean to be disloyal.

240
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,400
Lord of the country,

241
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,920
there are a lot of refugees outside the palace.

242
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,120
I bought an out-of-town letter.

243
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,920
What out-of-town letter?

244
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,560
I'm grateful to Lord of the country

245
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,960
for the money you gave me.

246
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,280
I see.

247
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,200
I'm so ashamed.

248
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,440
I was too narrow-minded

249
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,680
and misunderstood you.

250
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,880
I didn't expect you to have such a loving heart.

251
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,560
You helped the refugees to get rid of the family's wealth

252
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,680
and the troubles in the capital.

253
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,720
When the country is prosperous,

254
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,280
I will help you

255
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,840
to regain your spirit.

256
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,480
I hope you can be filial.

257
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,200
Goodbye, High Priestess.

258
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,280
Your Majesty.

259
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,080
Liu Mingman

260
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,240
will remember your natural offers.

261
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,280
I will send some medicine to you later.

262
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,600
Officers,

263
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,880
thank you so much.

264
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:22,820
marked with hate, your smile was as gentle as the dawn

265
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:26,080
Love and hatred together yet genderless

266
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,920
We were once properly half-loved

267
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:33,360
but形成 computed

268
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,360
You seek nefariousness

269
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,120
We were once properly emancipated

270
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,560
I'm sorry, is it you, me or the chainsaw

271
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:50,560
Locking you and me

272
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,760
You trample on the wind, breaking through the sky and earth

273
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:58,480
Drinking wine in the middle of the night

274
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,040
You don't want me to look back at the youth

275
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:06,000
I'll take revenge with my life

276
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,680
I'm in the middle of a troubled world, at the end of the night

277
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,440
In this world, I'm the loneliest

278
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,440
I'll go forward and look back
