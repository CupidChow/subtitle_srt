1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:06,160
climbs the next mountain

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,260
It's not the end

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,100
climb the next mountain

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I don't know if this money is enough to pay the fine.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Even if this time we have enough,

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
what about next time?

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
This time we won't let Si Shou sell the goods.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Next time,

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I don't think we can even keep the land of the small potatoes.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
When will this day end?

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It's okay.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
At the worst, we'll just rent the farm.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We'll just have to work hard.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not going to do anything.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We'll just rent the farm.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
It's hard, but we have to live.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Am I right?

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I used to be afraid of being dead all the time.

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Just to be alive.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I thought that

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
even if the world outside the palace wall

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
was hard to live in,

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
it would be less of a mess.

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I didn't have to worry about my life.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
But now,

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm standing outside the palace wall

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
and I find that

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm a busy woman who's busy with the country.

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
My life has been ruined.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
My life has been ruined.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The sisters of the Junlai Village,

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
because they can't have land,

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
they have to live in the family.

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
But I can't do anything.

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Do you want to go back to that place?

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I can't go back.

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Let's pack up.

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
We'll leave immediately.

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
That yulu dumplings are delicious.

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
They're chewy and look like a piece.

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Your Majesty.

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Enough playing.

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Let's go back to the palace.

44
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
As a woman,

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
you're such a liar.

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
My Lord.

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's all my fault.

48
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It has nothing to do with His Majesty.

49
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You're so capable.

50
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Such a big thing,

51
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
how can you hide it from me?

52
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Back then,

53
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Princess Consort Ning got sick.

54
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
The one who gave birth

55
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
was actually a girl.

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I don't know why,

57
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
she said she gave birth to a little prince.

58
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I was really helpless.

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
At that time, the late emperor was enthroned.

60
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
The princes were sealed.

61
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
If at that time,

62
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
you said the fifth prince wasn't a prince,

63
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm afraid

64
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
you can't live at all.

65
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
My Lord.

66
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
His Majesty was born with a mother.

67
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
He was trapped in the palace for many years.

68
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Now,

69
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
he finally left the palace.

70
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Please let him go.

71
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm willing to take His Majesty

72
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
back to the palace with you.

73
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Then you can't say it.

74
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Now, you're dead.

75
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Your Majesty.

76
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Please don't.

77
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Let go.

78
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Lord Pei.

79
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Please.

80
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Please let go of me.

81
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
My Lord.

82
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It's all my fault.

83
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I lied.

84
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
My Lord.

85
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Please let go of His Majesty.

86
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Please.

87
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You're the emperor.

88
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
How dare you kneel down and beg for mercy?

89
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I thought you were capable.

90
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You scolded me so hard in the imperial study that day.

91
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Now you're out of the palace.

92
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I really look down on you.

93
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Fan Shuang.

94
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Your Majesty.

95
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Your Majesty.

96
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Lord Pei.

97
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
As you know,

98
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm a woman.

99
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm like a soldier in the palace.

100
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I can't protect myself.

101
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I can't care about others.

102
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So what?

103
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
This is your excuse.

104
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
So,

105
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
you're as selfish as those people.

106
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You're really a man of your word.

107
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Sister Wu.

108
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Sister Wu.

109
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Sister Wu.

110
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Thank you, ladies.

111
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
We've received your kindness.

112
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
But we can't take the silver.

113
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I sewed it.

114
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's made of milk.

115
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It's very soft.

116
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It doesn't touch your feet.

117
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
If you don't mind,

118
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
you can wear it.

119
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Thank you.

120
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I like it.

121
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
We'll go back first.

122
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
You can come back to the village for a visit.

123
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Let's go.

124
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Let's go.

125
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Let's go.

126
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Your Majesty.

127
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
In that case,

128
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I don't want your puppet.

129
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
As long as you want to go back to the palace and suffer death,

130
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'll let Aunt Li go.

131
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Thank you, Lord Pei.

132
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Your Majesty, you can't.

133
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Before going back to the palace,

134
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
can you let me finish one more thing?

135
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Don't think about escaping.

136
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I won't.

137
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Who knocked on the lantern?

138
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I did.

139
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
What a naughty boy.

140
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I don't know.

141
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
He's really not a man of high status.

142
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Is there a name on the body of the person lying down?

143
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
No.

144
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
How dare you!

145
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Since there is no name on the body,

146
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
why don't you kneel down when you see me?

147
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Come on.

148
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Put him down.

149
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You'll be punished for defying the court.

150
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You'll be punished ten times.

151
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Yes.

152
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You're in such a hurry to be punished.

153
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Don't regret it.

154
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
What's this boy talking about?

155
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
He's so arrogant.

156
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Then tell me why you knocked on the lantern.

157
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I want to report to the local Hu Quan

158
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
for being rude and bullying his wife and daughter.

159
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Do you know who Hu Quan is?

160
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
How dare you report to him?

161
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I haven't finished yet.

162
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You haven't finished yet?

163
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
What's the hurry?

164
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
The new government of Qin Nan County

165
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
has no right to buy or sell goods.

166
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
But the adults have to do it.

167
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Finally, someone is here to talk about the new government.

168
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I don't know what's going on.

169
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
This edict is a dead end for us.

170
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Su Jing,

171
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
there are no rules.

172
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Only by knowing the edict can you control the cloth market better.

173
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
So,

174
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I still want to report to the magistrate of Qin Nan County,

175
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Cao Shouren.

176
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Who do you want to report to?

177
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I want to report to you,

178
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Mr. Cao.

179
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
The 274th law of the Daning Regulation

180
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
says that the local officials are not allowed to set up political rules.

181
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,120
You personally

182
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,000
have a new government and colluded with the local Hu Quan

183
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
to monopolize the cloth market.

184
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Have you heard the rumors outside the door?

185
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Moreover,

186
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
the farmland's rent and the court have a fixed amount.

187
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
But you let Hu Quan increase the rent.

188
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You are the farmer of Junlai Village and you are ungrateful.

189
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I want to report to you

190
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
that you two are the ones who did it.

191
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Master, please remember it clearly.

192
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
The 84th law of the Daning Regulation

193
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
says that if the court does not record the case,

194
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
the case will be sentenced to 10 years in prison.

195
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Sir,

196
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
do you admit your crime?

197
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
How dare you!

198
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
What crime did I, the magistrate, admit?

199
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
If you say

200
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
the 40th law of the Daning Regulation

201
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
says that the 106th law of the Daning Regulation

202
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
says that the local officials are not allowed to set up political rules.

203
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
You will be punished with 30 times more.

204
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Okay.

205
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Then let's fight.

206
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Sir,

207
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
why don't you tell me the truth

208
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
and tell me

209
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
who is the woman on you?

210
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Maybe we are still on the same side.

211
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Sir,

212
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
the magistrate just told me

213
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
that you might as well tell me the truth

214
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
and tell me who is the woman on you.

215
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Maybe we are still on the same side.

216
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Why are you standing there?

217
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Get angry!

218
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Since you are so eager to die,

219
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
don't blame me for being rude.

220
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Beat him!

221
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Yes.

222
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
How dare you!

223
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
How many heads do you have

224
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
to dare to hit him?

225
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Greetings, Mr. Zhang Yi of the Imperial Court.

226
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
This is Zhang Yi.

227
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
This is...

228
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I, Pei Shen Zhi, am not a good bodyguard.

229
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Please punish me, Your Majesty.

230
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Your Majesty!

231
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Your Majesty!

232
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Your Majesty!

233
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I am innocent!

234
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I am innocent!

235
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You only know to admit your crime now.

236
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It's too late.

237
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
You colluded with the women of the Qiling.

238
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
You ordered to return all the money

239
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
that was taken from the military.

240
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
You are a traitor.

241
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
You are not qualified to be a magistrate.

242
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
You will be sent to the south of Lingnan

243
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
to check the money.

244
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Your Majesty, don't worry.

245
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I have recorded everything.

246
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Finally,

247
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I will follow the order of the emperor

248
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
to punish you and the related people

249
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
for thirty times.

250
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It's the execution of the military

251
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
at the village entrance.

252
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Good!

253
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Your Majesty is wise!

254
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Execute!

255
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I can't do it.

256
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
The general is wise.

257
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
The people of the military are all surprised.

258
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Are you satisfied?

259
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
They don't know that I did it.

260
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Do you want them to know

261
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
or not?

262
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
No.

263
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Why?

264
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
They treated me with sincerity.

265
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
But I kept it.

266
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I feel ashamed.

267
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Don't worry.

268
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I will hide such a shameful thing

269
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
for you.

270
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Mr. Pei,

271
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
it's really hard to say.

272
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
If it sounds good,

273
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
it's usually a trap.

274
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
But I still want to thank you.

275
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Before I took off this dragon robe,

276
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I did something

277
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
familiar.

278
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
This is the spirit of the imperial power.

279
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
You tried to escape from the royal family.

280
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You can kill people

281
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
or save people.

282
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Now you want to go back to the palace

283
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
and continue to be the emperor.

284
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Mr. Pei,

285
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
will you spare my life?

286
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I changed my mind.

287
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I can keep your secret

288
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
as a woman for you.

289
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Moreover,

290
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
the female emperor has no money.

291
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Female emperor?

292
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Your blood is still soft.

293
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Your hatred is like a star.

294
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
It's not good.

295
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I have tried to hide it from you.

296
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I'm sorry.

297
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Are you me or a fake?

298
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
You and me are locked.

299
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
You are like the wind that breaks through the dream of heaven.

300
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
How long will it last?

301
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You don't want me to look back at the youth.

302
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I will never accept it.

303
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I am in the middle of a troubled world.

304
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:53,000
The end of darkness is the most lonely dream in the world.

305
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Go forward and look back.
