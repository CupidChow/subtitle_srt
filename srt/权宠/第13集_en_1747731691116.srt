1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,740
The Embroidering of The Con genial

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You've been calling me aunt for years.

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
This slap

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
is not a prison.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
His Majesty is smart.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
He should know the truth.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
He should know

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
what to do

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
and what not to do.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm willing to follow you.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Please

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
connect with me.

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Aunt

14
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Shen Chen Li

15
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Don't blame me for running back to the palace.

16
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm worried about your safety.

17
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's my fate to be caught by Zhuo Shang Xian.

18
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I want to tell you

19
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
that you will have no more weakness from now on.

20
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
The path you choose is right.

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You have the world in your heart.

22
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You will be a good emperor in the future.

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
When you really get to the top,

24
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'll wait for you

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
to take me back.

26
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Qin Sheng

27
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Your Majesty

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You should sit tight.

29
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Your Highness.

30
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,560
Mr. Pei.

31
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,520
You're really

32
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,880
a hero.

33
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,160
You gave me a sword as a hero?

34
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,520
You think

35
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,600
the sword is not good enough?

36
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,280
Or

37
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,880
the one who gave you the sword

38
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,400
is not good enough?

39
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,280
Your Majesty.

40
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,040
You're drunk.

41
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,400
I'm in a coma.

42
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,160
You care about me.

43
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,280
No.

44
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,520
Your Majesty.

45
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,480
What are you going to do?

46
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,280
Mr. Pei.

47
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,280
I don't understand.

48
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,960
I've already escaped from the palace.

49
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,280
Why do you have to take me back?

50
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,000
You said you'd take me as your enemy.

51
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,200
Why did you go to the king

52
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,160
when I needed you most?

53
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,240
I once said

54
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,240
if you insist on taking me as your enemy,

55
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,680
I can't be with you.

56
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,480
Now that you've made up your mind,

57
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,640
I can only say one thing

58
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,640
about you.

59
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,400
Your Majesty.

60
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,800
You've misunderstood.

61
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,880
Mr. Pei.

62
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,480
The last question.

63
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,400
I want to know

64
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,080
if it's also a misunderstanding.

65
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,560
Mr. Pei.

66
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,560
Have you ever been happy with me?

67
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,560
Never.

68
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,600
I've never put His Majesty in my heart.

69
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,760
I also advise His Majesty

70
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,480
not to take it personally.

71
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,160
I understand.

72
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,880
Mr. Pei.

73
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,280
This is my last chance.

74
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,880
I've been honest with you.

75
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,600
I've been in the palace.

76
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,280
I've been in charge of the government,

77
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,560
the capital and the people.

78
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,400
I've been in the private sector.

79
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,960
I've even robbed my most important family

80
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,360
and forced them to kill me.

81
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,280
Since you've been on his side,

82
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,000
we're

83
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,000
enemies.

84
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,720
He's really powerful,

85
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,760
it's not like me.

86
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,680
I'm asking for your kilogram of meatloaf

87
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,720
for this last time.

88
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,040
Have your np haven't eaten a whole surely United States

89
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,720
which can slice up the releases first and question

90
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,220
a toast and quitai

91
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,920
or agonize the health ofibility of our country.

92
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,940
As the

93
00:06:54,180 --> 00:07:19,100
golden

94
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,380
to help the refugees.

95
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,820
I'm in a bad mood

96
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,860
and I'm sweating.

97
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,620
I wonder what you think

98
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,700
should be done.

99
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,620
Your Majesty, you've grown up.

100
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,620
You should have your own opinion.

101
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,820
You should learn to think on your own.

102
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:40,380
I'm just a man of the government.

103
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,060
How can I be a good servant to you?

104
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,260
Of course you can.

105
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,260
slave

106
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:56,640
Sh Molcé

107
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,360
What is it?

108
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,080
Even the heaven

109
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,540
feels my sincerity.

110
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:19,860
I

111
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,860
in the view of the Lord of the Fuguo

112
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,260
who has worked hard

113
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,540
from today on

114
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,740
I will call him the Prime Minister

115
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,100
and everything in the court

116
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,180
will be handled by the Lord of the Fuguo

117
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,020
The power of the Lord of the Fuguo

118
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,740
will be mine

119
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:34,820
What?

120
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,060
Your Majesty

121
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,020
Please don't

122
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,740
Please don't

123
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:39,620
Please don't

124
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,100
The Prime Minister is a gentleman

125
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,700
He is a man of decency

126
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,260
He is a man of decency

127
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,020
He is a man of decency

128
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,620
He is a man of decency

129
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,340
He is a man of decency

130
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,940
Please accept my apology

131
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,420
Good

132
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,620
Good

133
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:09,500
Then I thank you

134
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:12,540
You should study hard in the future

135
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,940
so that you can make progress in politics

136
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,580
I will obey your instruction

137
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,500
Huozheng

138
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,100
Last time you disobeyed the justice

139
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:31,260
You mixed the Prime Minister with that sinner Zhuo Minghua

140
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,940
You almost destroyed the imperial court

141
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,460
You are a commoner

142
00:09:46,460 --> 00:10:10,860
week

143
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,340
This quarter is really deformed

144
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,700
Gugu has found out

145
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,940
a different strategy

146
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,140
We will make up.

147
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:22,420
Guoguo.

148
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,260
I will definitely make you back.

149
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,020
Now,

150
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,580
let's make a new sacrifice.

151
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:48,160
Independent Counter Update

152
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,020
If I lose it,

153
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,460
he will leave me in a completamente czylierie state.

154
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:14,440
40 intro comeback

155
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,460
Your Majesty, you're awake.

156
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,700
You threw me out of the palace.

157
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,060
Why did you make me dizzy?

158
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,300
Did you

159
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,860
put me in that white thing

160
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,700
and bring me out?

161
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,380
I thought Your Majesty

162
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,700
had prepared incense and incense.

163
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,060
Fine.

164
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,260
Your Majesty,

165
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,540
we're running out of time.

166
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,060
We must rush back to the palace

167
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:52,820
before the last guard

168
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:53,580
comes back.

169
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,140
They're outside.

170
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,220
Please come with me, Your Majesty.

171
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:56,900
Wait.

172
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:58,780
Mr. Huo,

173
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,220
how many people are here?

174
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:23,040
You may

175
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,140
Your Majesty.

176
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:44,580
In the past,

177
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,460
when I ordered Mr. Huo

178
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,980
to summon all the ministers,

179
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,700
I never thought

180
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,220
I would get such a response from all the ministers.

181
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:55,740
I even worry

182
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,540
what would happen

183
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,460
if no one came.

184
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,260
Your Majesty,

185
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,740
we are ashamed.

186
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,260
We thought

187
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,020
Your Majesty was a puppet.

188
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,620
But the Junlai Village case

189
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,060
not only made the world

190
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,460
know about Your Majesty's name,

191
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:10,820
but also made us

192
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,700
see through Your Majesty's courage.

193
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:13,700
Your Majesty,

194
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,740
I thought you were a weakling.

195
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,140
You never fought

196
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,460
or went out of the capital.

197
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:19,740
You were full of

198
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,020
words of gossip.

199
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:21,940
Mr. Gu,

200
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,420
mind your words.

201
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,820
Don't be so rude.

202
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:26,900
I was just saying that.

203
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:27,700
Your Majesty,

204
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,020
that day in the hall,

205
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,860
you didn't care about life and death.

206
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:31,860
You were so brave.

207
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,180
I was convinced.

208
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:33,860
Your Majesty,

209
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,620
the state of Daning has been in power for decades.

210
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,700
The state has not been established.

211
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:37,820
The corruption is weak.

212
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:38,820
The people are not living.

213
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,060
The people in the world

214
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:40,980
hope that Your Majesty can

215
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:41,700
establish a wild and violent regime

216
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,820
to eradicate the Ji Bi.

217
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,380
In the name of the world,

218
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,980
we are willing to help Your Majesty

219
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,660
to save the world.

220
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:54,540
I, Wang Xiu Long,

221
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:56,580
am willing to help Your Majesty.

222
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,860
I, Lu Zichong,

223
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,180
am willing to help Your Majesty.

224
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,660
I, Gu Xingzhi,

225
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,180
I, Wu Jingxi,

226
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,220
am willing to help Your Majesty.

227
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,900
We are willing to help Your Majesty.

228
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,980
The Senior display millionaires,

229
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,280
I have been well informed.

230
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:14,700
In the future,

231
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:15,320
when the Senior display millionaires

232
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,980
َhelp me deal with clearly,

233
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:24,120
you will be able to

234
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,580
be rereliant to all court officials.

235
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,440
Your Majesty,

236
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,080
I have some important things to report.

237
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,640
It was hard to find the자

238
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:31,900
today,

239
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,880
Zhuo Gou ordered a swatch of the剜

240
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,560
He divided into two品

241
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,760
includingitness bags,

242
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,520
but the two treasures were stolen.

243
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,880
I've been investigating for days

244
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,360
to get reliable clues.

245
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,480
This Zhuo Gou

246
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,840
hid a lot of money

247
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,120
in his secret vault.

248
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,520
If we can destroy the vault in one go,

249
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,240
we can also

250
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,000
make a big mistake with Zhuo Gou's skills.

251
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,880
Do you know where the vault is now?

252
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,480
I'm investigating.

253
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,560
I've been in the Ghost Valley Army for years.

254
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,240
I've been keeping that Pei under pressure.

255
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,440
If we can take over the military power of the Ghost Valley Army,

256
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,360
even if we take the vault,

257
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,280
Zhuo Gou can't be trusted by me.

258
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,360
It seems that a troublemaker

259
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,240
is looking for the Master.

260
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,080
The first task

261
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,160
is to ask Lord Fu Guo to lead us

262
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,720
to his vault

263
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,120
in person.

264
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,120
Will he

265
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,720
be so kind?

266
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,600
Your Majesty.

267
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,400
I'm sorry.

268
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,200
I'm sorry.

269
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,000
I'm sorry.

270
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,760
I'm sorry.

271
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,600
I'm sorry.

272
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,600
I'm sorry.

273
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,600
I'm sorry.

274
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,600
I'm sorry.

275
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,600
I'm sorry.

276
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,600
I'm sorry.

277
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,600
I'm sorry.

278
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,600
I'm sorry.

279
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,600
I'm sorry.

280
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,600
I'm sorry.

281
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,600
I'm sorry.

282
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,600
I'm sorry.

283
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,600
I'm sorry.

284
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,600
I'm sorry.

285
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,600
I'm sorry.

286
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,600
I'm sorry.

287
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,600
I'm sorry.

288
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,600
I'm sorry.

289
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,600
I'm sorry.

290
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,600
I'm sorry.

291
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,600
I'm sorry.

292
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,600
I'm sorry.

293
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,600
I'm sorry.

294
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,600
I'm sorry.

295
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,600
I'm sorry.

296
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,600
I'm sorry.

297
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,440
I'm sorry.

298
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,440
I'm sorry.

299
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,440
I'm sorry.

300
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,440
I'm sorry.

301
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,440
I'm sorry.

302
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,440
I'm sorry.

303
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,440
I'm sorry.

304
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,440
I'm sorry.

305

I'm sorry.

306
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,440
I'm sorry.

307
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,440
I'm sorry.

308
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,440
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,440
I'm sorry.

321
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,440
I'm sorry.
