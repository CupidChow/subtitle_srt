00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Episode 1

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
You're a traitor!

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
You're a traitor!

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
If it weren't for me, you would have died eight times!

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
What did I do to you?

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
You tainted that woman!

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'll break her skin!

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Shut up! Who did you taint?

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Her little mother!

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Zhao Ruolan!

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It turns out that Lord Zhuo wasn't blinded.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
He was already set free.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I understand.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
How dare you try to sow discord and win me over?

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Yes. So what?

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Isn't Lord Zhuo admitting it himself?

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Your Majesty, the truth is clear.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Lord Zhuo wasn't blinded by someone.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
He knew that the Luofu Sea Hall was tainted by Zhao Ruolan.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
He took bribes and forged evidence.

22
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
This led to the riot in the village.

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
He was sentenced to death by evil.

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
He was killed by a traitor!

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
He killed 36 people at the very least!

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
He's really arrogant!

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Your Majesty, please report.

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
He was dismissed from the post of Zhuo Minghua.

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
His soul was killed.

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
How dare you!

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
How dare I?

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I...

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
If you dare to move, I'll kill you.

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Let me go!

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You traitor!

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
How dare you treat me like this?

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Brother, save me!

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Everyone knows that Zhuo Minghua is the cousin of Lord Zhuo.

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
But I'm sure that Lord Zhuo didn't know that

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Zhuo Minghua committed such a grave crime.

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Lord Zhuo was honored and was greatly rewarded.

42
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I agree with Lord Zhuo.

43
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I wonder what you think about this case.

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Your Majesty, you can judge me however you want.

45
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I don't mind.

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I, Luo Fuhai, Zhai Qing, Zhuo Minghua,

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
will be sentenced to death.

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You little rascal!

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Why are you afraid of me?

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And Zhuo Shengxian, the old dog!

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
How dare you not help me?

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You've done so much for the Zhuo family!

53
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Zhuo Shengxian, I'm telling you,

54
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
you still have eight lives left!

55
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I told you,

56
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
if you move again,

57
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'll kill you.

58
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Your Majesty,

59
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Lord Zhuo,

60
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Zhuo Minghua committed a crime and tried to get revenge.

61
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I've sentenced him to death.

62
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
The case of Junlai Village is closed.

63
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Guards, drag Zhuo Minghua out.

64
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Drag her out.

65
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Junlai Village, also known as Guafu Village.

66
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
This case almost caused the whole village to be destroyed.

67
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Their lives were hard and they were oppressed.

68
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
But they wanted to live better than anyone else.

69
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Even if they were forced to such a desperate situation,

70
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
they never thought of leaving this place

71
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
which is known as Guafu Village.

72
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Why?

73
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Because the world is so big

74
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
and there's no place for them to live.

75
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Because they can't have their own land

76
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
no matter where they go.

77
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Because they have no choice.

78
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I don't want this to happen again.

79
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I want to give them a choice

80
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
which is as hard as the world.

81
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I want to publish a new government.

82
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
From today on,

83
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
the new female house of our Daning Dynasty

84
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
can be the owner of the house.

85
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You can have land

86
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
and no man.

87
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Your Majesty, I have a message.

88
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Women should be married and have children.

89
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It's impossible to change the law

90
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
from the beginning of the world.

91
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It's ridiculous to be the owner.

92
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
There are so many sun and rain in the world.

93
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
There are so many trees.

94
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's not hard to have them.

95
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
This is the thing that the world can't tolerate.

96
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Since ancient times,

97
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
people have lived in the world

98
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
and no one can change it.

99
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It's an old and inconvenient law.

100
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Sir,

101
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
the saint taught you the way to control the world.

102
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The teacher taught you to control the world.

103
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
But who taught you the way to listen to the teachings?

104
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Who taught you the way to change the world?

105
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Who taught you

106
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
to be so ungrateful?

107
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Sir,

108
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
you are standing on my throne

109
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
and talking about the ancestors

110
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
and the power of the world.

111
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
No.

112
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You should talk about

113
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
your mother,

114
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
the only mother-in-law.

115
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Your mother,

116
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
the fruit of a lifetime that no one cares about.

117
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It's you

118
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
who cut off your mother's dignity.

119
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You,

120
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
who cut off your mother's dignity.

121
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Family.

122
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's your family

123
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
and their family.

124
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I give the edict

125
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
that from today,

126
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
women should be the guardians

127
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
and the leader of the family.

128
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Your Majesty.

129
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,960
and make the world a better place.

130
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,960
Now that you've issued the new order,

131
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,200
you and Little Potato

132
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,400
can live a good life.

133
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,600
A'De will send you back safely.

134
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,360
Go.

135
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,640
Come on.

136
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,440
Xiao Wu!

137
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,000
What are you doing?

138
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,480
Come and play!

139
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,880
Come on!

140
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,800
Come and play!

141
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,480
Come here!

142
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,600
Come and play!

143
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,600
Come on!

144
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,200
Come here!

145
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,200
Come here!

146
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,440
Come and play!

147
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Come and play!

148
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,240
Come here!

149
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,000
Sister.

150
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,600
Come and play!

151
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,640
His Majesty is really good at making a move.

152
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,520
What's the use?

153
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,720
He offended Zhuo Fu.

154
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,480
It seems that His Majesty can't do it.

155
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,560
Stop talking.

156
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,120
I know.

157
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,640
Establishing and dispatching office

158
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,560
I am wrong over the matter.

159
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,280
If not for you,

160
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,600
we and factor division

161
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,120
can't give the order freely.

162
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,880
If it is explanations out of court

163
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:22,720
and ill act out of

164
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,520
The imperial censor of the Ducha House is the second-ranked.

165
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,120
His speed is so fast.

166
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,440
He's not a low-ranking man.

167
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,400
I'm afraid he's not a low-ranking man.

168
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:31,880
Your Majesty,

169
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,080
I'm sorry for my mistake.

170
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,880
Zhuo Minghua is the oldest.

171
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,240
There's one more thing I haven't mentioned.

172
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,640
Huozheng!

173
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,000
I disobeyed the imperial edict.

174
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,640
I'm not guilty.

175
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,320
But I'm willing to follow the teacher

176
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,400
and meet you here.

177
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:52,960
You...

178
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,800
Take it!

179
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,440
This is the account book

180
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,520
that the Ducha House has been searching for.

181
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,360
The amount is very important.

182
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,440
With this amount,

183
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,600
we can figure out

184
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,480
how many money and money Zhuo Minghua has collected.

185
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,760
I found that

186
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,240
many of the money and money

187
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,360
were left by one person.

188
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,680
The master of the Daning Empire,

189
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,360
Zhuo Shangxian.

190
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,960
I beg Your Majesty

191
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,960
to investigate the account book

192
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,480
and completely destroy

193
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,960
the Ducha House.

194
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,520
I beg Your Majesty to investigate it.

195
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,480
I beg Your Majesty to investigate it.

196
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,640
I beg Your Majesty to investigate it.

197
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,080
I beg Your Majesty to investigate it.

198
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,400
Mr. Huo is really good at talking.

199
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,040
Ducha House.

200
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,960
Are you referring to me?

201
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,120
Why have you가

202
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,760
delque 박 Caitlin?

203
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,840
To save the karate party

204
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,840
from sufferingๆ

205
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,960
what is all this about?

206
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,400
Your Majesty!

207
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,320
Why should we wait until after the execution?

208
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,520
Since I am the son of His Majesty,

209
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,720
I've been doing everything myself

210
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,520
and for everyone to be convinced.

211
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,320
But now,

212
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,800
how can someone make a quack

213
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,120
whom it's been years that he's been in?

214
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,520
You are now the creator of punishment for me.

215
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,520
I'd like to ask

216
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,960
what's your purpose.

217
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,280
Your Majesty,

218
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,640
what's your intention?

219
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,320
Zhuo Fu State

220
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,800
is in charge of governance.

221
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,080
I have no qualms.

222
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,200
I'm not afraid to investigate.

223
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,640
You want to investigate me?

224
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,680
But no.

225
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,880
Mr. Huo placed responsibility.

226
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,560
Who gives a second chance

227
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,960
to Mo Xuyu?

228
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,000
I wonder

229
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,080
who

230
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,040
can investigate

231
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,920
more expensive things.

232
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,920
It's still a scab!

233
00:11:47,680 --> 00:12:11,860
The

234
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,800
Lu Zhang.

235
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,960
Someone said I was a traitor.

236
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,680
Do you want to clear the military plan

237
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,520
and kill me,

238
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,640
the traitor in Lord Huo's eyes?

239
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,480
One year later

240
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,160
Those who are loyal and upright

241
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,920
are the ones who serve the country enough.

242
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:10,440
Stop

243
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,960
Let's go.

244
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,920
The

245
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,920
The

246
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,920
The

247
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,920
The

248
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,920
The

249
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,920
The

250
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,920
The

251
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,920
The

252
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,920
The

253
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,920
The

254
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,920
The

255
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,920
The

256
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,920
The

257
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,920
The

258
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,920
The

259
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,920
The

260
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:26,920
The

261
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,920
The

262
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,920
The

263
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,920
The

264
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,920
I'm in the midst of a troubled world, at the end of the night

265
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:19,920
I'm in the most lonely dream in the world

266
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,920
I'll turn around as I walk forward
