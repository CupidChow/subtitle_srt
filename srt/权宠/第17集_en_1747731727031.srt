00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,500
My Lord, you're back.

4
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,500
Something happened.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The Yiling Army's residence was burned down.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Is there any harm?

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You'd better worry about your own situation.

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Greetings, Your Majesty.

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Lord Hu,

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
you're here to see His Majesty.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm here to see His Majesty.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm here to see His Majesty.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm here to see His Majesty.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm here to see His Majesty.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm here to see His Majesty.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Lord Hu,

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
please go on.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
If I hadn't found the fire

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
at the Yiling Army's residence

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
last night,

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm afraid

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
the entire Yiling Army

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
would be burned down.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Lord Pei, as the commander of the Yiling Army,

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
what happened?

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Your Majesty,

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I think

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
he should be punished

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
for being a misbehavior.

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Your Majesty,

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
please disperse the order

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
of the commander of the Yiling Army

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
and punish him according to military law.

34
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'll do my best.

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Okay.

36
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Then, according to Lord Zheng,

37
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
what kind of military law should he be?

38
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
According to the law,

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
he should be sentenced to eight years' imprisonment

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and five years' imprisonment.

41
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Your Majesty,

42
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
how do you want to punish me?

43
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I think

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
the Yiling Army has suffered heavy losses.

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Lord Pei can't be blamed for this.

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
But

47
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
the sentence of eight years' imprisonment

48
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
and five years' imprisonment

49
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
is too heavy.

50
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Why don't you

51
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
make it a bit more severe?

52
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Lord Pei

53
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
is sentenced to three years' imprisonment

54
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
according to the order of the commander of the Yiling Army.

55
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I wonder

56
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
how you think about it.

57
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I

58
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
will listen to your advice.

59
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I didn't know that

60
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
His Majesty had such a good strategy

61
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
to attract the Yiling Army's military officers,

62
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Mr. Gu

63
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
and the Minister of Justice, Lord Zheng.

64
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
They cooperated so well.

65
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
People are evil.

66
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Everything is dirty.

67
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm just being honest.

68
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's our duty to serve His Majesty.

69
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
But in the mouth of Lord Zhuo,

70
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
you're acting like a traitor.

71
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Your actions

72
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
are so ridiculous.

73
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
People.

74
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Guards.

75
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Take him out

76
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
and punish him with forty times.

77
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Yes.

78
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Stop.

79
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The main hall

80
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
must be brought in by the edict.

81
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Are you going to rebel?

82
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I dare not.

83
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Where is the Yiling Army?

84
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
How could he move the Yiling Army?

85
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Where is the tiger tally?

86
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Your Majesty.

87
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's a good strategy.

88
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Good.

89
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
The Yiling Army is here to listen to Your Majesty's advice.

90
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Mr. Gu.

91
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You're disrespectful to the Minister of Justice.

92
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Thirty times.

93
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm here to punish you.

94
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Gu Tingjun is a general.

95
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
He broke into the main hall.

96
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Thirty times.

97
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm here to punish you.

98
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Mr. Pei.

99
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You left the post

100
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
and disobeyed the order of your Yiling Army leader.

101
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Thirty times.

102
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Do you accept the punishment?

103
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm guilty.

104
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Good.

105
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Very good.

106
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Go on.

107
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Thirty times is not enough.

108
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Yes.

109
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It seems that Your Majesty thinks

110
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
the throne is stable.

111
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You don't have to

112
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
disobey the honor of us.

113
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You misunderstood.

114
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's just that the country has its own laws.

115
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I feel sorry for Mr. Pei.

116
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Since you feel sorry for your son,

117
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'll punish him.

118
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's not a big deal.

119
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
The post is saved.

120
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Look.

121
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Look.

122
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Look at you.

123
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Now you're so strong.

124
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
How dare you step on my feet

125
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
and rub your face with mine?

126
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Thank you for the lesson.

127
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Thank you for saving me.

128
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Did you play a game

129
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
with me?

130
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Father, you're too much.

131
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You don't deserve it.

132
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Otherwise, I'm afraid

133
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I can't protect you

134
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
as the son of the previous dynasty.

135
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Go.

136
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You bitch.

137
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You're the same as the emperor.

138
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You're all bitch.

139
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I must kill her.

140
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Father, be careful.

141
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You may hurt yourself.

142
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
What did you say?

143
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Do you hate me now?

144
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Do you hate me now?

145
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You're so cruel.

146
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I hate you.

147
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
But I hate you more.

148
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'll fall in love with you.

149
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
What tricks are you playing?

150
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
If I didn't love you,

151
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I wouldn't be willing to serve you.

152
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You're a bitch.

153
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
After all,

154
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
you can't give me real happiness.

155
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
But when I'm with you,

156
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I feel happy.

157
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Even if you torture me

158
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
all over my body,

159
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I still want to be with you.

160
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So,

161
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I want you to be happy.

162
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Your Majesty.

163
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Lord Zhang Ying.

164
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You came to serve me in such a hurry.

165
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Why don't you get some rest?

166
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Your Majesty,

167
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
is there anything you want to say to me?

168
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
What do you want to hear?

169
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Your Majesty.

170
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
How come I didn't know

171
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Lord Pei

172
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
is a dog who bites people.

173
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Why are you so happy?

174
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You're satisfied

175
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
with my show?

176
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
This is

177
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
a birthday gift I prepared for you.

178
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
No one can stop you

179
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
from now on.

180
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,440
It's been a while since we last met.

181
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,680
It's been going well.

182
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,200
But

183
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,160
you've suffered.

184
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,600
Take off your clothes and show me.

185
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,360
What?

186
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:27,960
Are you shy?

187
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,360
You took off your clothes last night.

188
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,600
Wasn't it quite tight?

189
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,480
Hurry up.

190
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,480
This is an imperial order.

191
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,200
Yes, Your Majesty.

192
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,120
Do you feel much more calm

193
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,280
after being BJed together with STE water?

194
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,440
I just wanna know

195
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,680
whether you like the water,

196
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,880
this garden with your family.

197
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,080
was anywhere else,

198
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,160
but you chose plants.

199
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,200
So it's still weird to me

200
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,240
why someone

201
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,800
doesn't honor your hands.

202
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,720
Are there someone

203
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,760
who has your heart

204
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,720
I need you to leave me.

205
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,840
I'm not far from

206
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,120
this.

207
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,520
But now,

208
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,480
Pei Chen Zhi,

209
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,360
I forgive you.

210
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,640
Thank you, Your Majesty.

211
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,840
Thank you, Mr. Pei.

212
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,320
I'm willing to take care of you.

213
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,440
Pei Zhengyin,

214
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,880
Zhao Fu will be waiting for you.

215
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,240
How are the brothers of Shen Xingying?

216
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,760
We're fine, Your Majesty.

217
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,520
I'm glad to hear that.

218
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,400
The brothers know that you're injured.

219
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,880
They're worried about you.

220
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,840
They want to see you.

221
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,760
I'm fine.

222
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:20,920
Don't worry.

223
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,640
I know you left the army

224
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,160
for the sake of the country.

225
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,160
Since you took the new throne,

226
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,160
you've been hardworking and sacrificed a lot.

227
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,800
But now, you're in this state.

228
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,800
If you hadn't retreated,

229
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,120
I would have chosen a dangerous path.

230
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,840
Luckily, I was right.

231
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,160
A Ze,

232
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:49,480
no matter Shen Xingying

233
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,640
or the whole Yiling Army,

234
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,480
you must obey His Majesty's order.

235
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,880
His Majesty is smart and kind.

236
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,560
He will lead the army

237
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,920
to leave the dark night

238
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,400
and come to light.

239
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,560
Yes.

240
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,760
We believe in your choice.

241
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,280
We'll serve His Majesty to the end.

242
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:04,920
Go.

243
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,560
Feng Niang.

244
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,480
Feng Niang.

245
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,520
Feng Niang.

246
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,560
Why is the name so familiar?

247
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,080
I can't wait to have her back!

248
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,280
The cloth

249
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:29,960
deals with the palace

250
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,800
in the time ofpicnics.

251
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,200
The person being dragged away

252
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,480
and held in a kiln

253
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,120
I think you should ask him or her to give you an earful,

254
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,520
and ask him to proceed.

255
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,840
OK, we willいく with that.

256
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,360
OK, Seekle and WANG,

257
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:24,260
There is a memorial for print Belgium case .

258
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,240
It's said that Pei Zhaoying is very delicate.

259
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,440
I suggest that we grab him away.

260
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,280
I'm a courtier.

261
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,040
There's another one.

262
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,240
It says that you're as beautiful as the clouds.

263
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,680
You often make a noise and make people complain.

264
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,880
I'm a man of my word.

265
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,640
I'm always busy.

266
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,560
Your Majesty, I'm wronged.

267
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,520
Your Majesty,

268
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,920

269
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,200

00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,600

00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:12,920
Thanks to Your Majesty.

274
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,000
I'm fine.

275
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,480
What's the matter?

276
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,360
You made me wait in the imperial tomb for a day.

277
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,120
It's okay to talk to you alone.

278
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,120
It's autumn today.

279
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,360
It's very busy outside.

280
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,800
The people are waiting for the weather to be good.

281
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,520
I'm here to ask Your Majesty to pray for me.

282
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,680
I want to make a good start.

283
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,200
Pray for you?

284
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:39,800
Okay.

285
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,280
Let the Censor of the Imperial Censorate wait for a day.

286
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,680
Your Majesty, today is the day.

287
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,680
I've prepared everything.
