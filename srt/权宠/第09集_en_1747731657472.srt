1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,680
Lord Pei,

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,800
won't you stop me?

5
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,280
Of course not.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Taoism Grandmaster

8
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,800
Gui Fen,

9
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,800
Ru Lan,

10
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,200
Zhao Di,

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,800
I will help you.

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Who?

13
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Little Potato,

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Zhao Di,

15
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Zhao Di,

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Don't hit Zhao Di.

17
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,000
Zhao Di knows nothing.

18
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Don't hit Zhao Di.

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Don't hit Zhao Di.

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Don't hit Zhao Di.

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Pei,

22
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Huo Zheng,

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
please keep them safe.

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Make sure they are safe.

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Yes.

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
What is your plan?

27
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I want to hide it from Ru Lan.

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I will do it.

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Lord Huo,

30
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I will let you

31
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
take charge of the investigation.

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I will be in charge of this case.

33
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Since Pei Zhang Ying

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
insists on taking part in this case,

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
then I will ask Pei Zhang Ying

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
to help Huo Zheng

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
to capture Jin Hua Jun,

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Fu Ying, Zhuo Ming Hua

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
and Fu Shang, Luo Fu Hai.

40
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
What do you think?

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Your Majesty, you can't.

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I will obey your order.

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Your Majesty, you can't.

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I will obey your order.

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Your Majesty, this man is wild.

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You can't let him take part in this case.

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Please take back your order.

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Lord Huo,

49
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
this case involves Jin Hua Jun and Fu Ying.

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Jin Hua Jun is our top enemy.

51
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Zhuo Ming Hua is in the capital.

52
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
He is a bad man.

53
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
With Lord Pei,

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
he will be an assistant.

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Besides,

56
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I believe Lord Pei

57
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
will not let me down.

58
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Your Majesty, please decide.

59
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The wind has blown away.

60
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
The ice has frozen.

61
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Lord Huo, please.

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Why is His Majesty in the rain?

63
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Is he cold?

64
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
What are you thinking about?

65
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I am thinking about

66
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Zhuo Ming Hua

67
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
who killed 36 sisters of Junlai Village.

68
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
They were all killed.

69
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
If I can't kill him,

70
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I will be in trouble for the rest of my life.

71
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
But

72
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
if I betray him,

73
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
he will be angry at me

74
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
and even call for a death.

75
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
But if I don't even

76
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
make the decision for them,

77
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
who in the world

78
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
can calm down

79
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
the grievances of these souls?

80
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I am wronged.

81
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Aunt,

82
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I wanted to live for myself.

83
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
So I escaped once.

84
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
But I can't be beautiful

85
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
even if I am in trouble for this.

86
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
After returning from the palace,

87
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I thought

88
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I would be in this palace

89
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
for only one day

90
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
and one hour.

91
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I want to let my people

92
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
know that

93
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
in this dynasty,

94
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
there is someone

95
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
who wants to support them.

96
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
What do you want to do?

97
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Then go and do it.

98
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I support you.

99
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Let's die together

100
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
together.

101
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Together.

102
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
In this world,

103
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
there are always fools.

104
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Who dares to catch me

105
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
with your guts?

106
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Do you know who I am?

107
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Okay.

108
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Then tell me

109
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
who you are.

110
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I want to sign

111
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
the seal of the Jin Hua County

112
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
and help Lord Ming Hua, Lord Zhuo.

113
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
If Lord Zhuo knows

114
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
that you caught me,

115
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
you will all die.

116
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
In that case,

117
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Lord Huo,

118
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
let's go and meet

119
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
this Lord Zhuo.

120
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Let me out.

121
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Let me out.

122
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Let me out.

123
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Let me out.

124
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Who did I think

125
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
was so bold

126
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
to invite me here?

127
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It turned out to be Mr. Pei.

128
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
We haven't met for a long time.

129
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
What?

130
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Is this your way of treating guests?

131
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Uncle Zhuo,

132
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
how are you?

133
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
In your eyes,

134
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
there is also me.

135
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Before I get angry,

136
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
let me go.

137
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Otherwise...

138
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
The case of Junlai Village is very involved.

139
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Uncle Zhuo,

140
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
please cooperate.

141
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
What do you mean?

142
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You want to interrogate me?

143
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Who gave you the ability

144
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
to interrogate me?

145
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Of course, it's our legal department.

146
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
No matter what royal family you are,

147
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
no one can do it.

148
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Who are you?

149
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I am Huo Zheng.

150
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I am the secret inspector

151
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
appointed by the emperor.

152
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I am responsible for the investigation of Junlai Village's case.

153
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
The whole world

154
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
knows

155
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
the real master's surname

156
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
behind this country.

157
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
He is a young and young man

158
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
with a long beard.

159
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
How dare he touch me?

160
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Uncle Zhuo,

161
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I have to persuade you.

162
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Now your life

163
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
is in his hands.

164
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Pei Shenzhi,

165
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
do you know what you are talking about?

166
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Mr. Huo,

167
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I have caught him for you.

168
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Next,

169
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
it's up to you.

170
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Pei Shenzhi,

171
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I tell you,

172
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
no one can interrogate this case.

173
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
How about

174
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I tell you the truth now?

175
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
If you dare interrogate me,

176
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I will take the family of Zhuo

177
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
and take them to the hell.

178
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Yes.

179
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
My son is busy with the case.

180
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
He has time to visit my father.

181
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
It's really hard.

182
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I know it.

183
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It's a group of people

184
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
who are in disguise

185
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
and are causing trouble at the government office.

186
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
This Minghua

187
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
has a bad temper.

188
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
After being the son of Junhua Prefecture,

189
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
he doesn't know how to behave.

190
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
He is a good man.

191
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
He is a good man.

192
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
He is a good man.

193
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
He doesn't know how to behave.

194
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
He did teach him a lesson.

195
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
But he has made a lot of efforts

196
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
on the way up to us.

197
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
He has no credit or effort.

198
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Do whatever you want.

199
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I don't mind.

200
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Even if it's a show,

201
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
you don't mind, do you?

202
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
If you really think he should die,

203
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
it's not impossible.

204
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Minghua is my only cousin.

205
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
If he dies,

206
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I will not let him go.

207
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I understand.

208
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Whoever wants to kill him

209
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
will not be spared.

210
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Besides, I think

211
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
there shouldn't be

212
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
such a person

213
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
who is not aware of the future.

214
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Not necessarily.

215
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
For example, our little emperor.

216
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
For example,

217
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
you.

218
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Godfather, what does this mean?

219
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
My son is very smart.

220
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You can't tell the connection

221
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
between the emperor and me.

222
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
After all, you still have

223
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
the military power.

224
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Besides, you are very close

225
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
to our little emperor.

226
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Isn't it?

227
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Don't forget

228
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
the secret of your birth.

229
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Only I, as a father,

230
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
really care about you.

231
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Do you understand?

232
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Godfather, don't worry.

233
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I know what I am thinking.

234
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Your Majesty.

235
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Your Majesty, what are you looking at?

236
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
The files of Junlai Village.

237
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It seems that

238
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
you have new findings.

239
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Lord Pei,

240
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I have a question for you.

241
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
If you want to ask, ask.

242
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I will tell you the truth.

243
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Lord Pei,

244
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
you killed He Yushu.

245
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
If I say yes,

246
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
will His Majesty

247
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
punish me on the spot?

248
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
You really killed him.

249
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Why?

250
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
What else does His Majesty think?

251
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Why?

252
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Of course, because he

253
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
confronted us

254
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
in front of the world.

255
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Lord Pei,

256
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I can't see you clearly.

257
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I thought Lord Pei...

258
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
What do you think?

259
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Do you know?

260
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I once thought

261
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
if I could really

262
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
rule the country,

263
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I would tell the world

264
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
that

265
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Pei Shenzhi

266
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
is a good official

267
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
worthy of my trust.

268
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Your Majesty,

269
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
you shouldn't have any hope

270
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
for me.

271
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Pei Shenzhi,

272
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
why do you want to change?

273
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I came today

274
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
to tell you

275
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
that I won't stand by you

276
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
in the case of Junlai Village.

277
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Your Majesty is a smart person.

278
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
You should think about

279
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
how much you can afford.

280
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
If you upset Lord Pei,

281
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
will you and Aunt Li

282
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
be able to

283
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
calm down his anger?

284
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
You want to fight against the world.

285
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Are you ready?

286
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Yes.

287
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Pei Shenzhi,

288
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
you are so determined.

289
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Why did you give up today?

290
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Are you afraid of Lord Fu's power

291
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
or

292
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
you have another plan?

293
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Your Majesty,

294
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I'm afraid

295
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I can't help you.

296
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I'm afraid

297
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
you can't help me.

298
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I'm afraid

299
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
you can't help me.

300
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
After all,

301
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
you have the military power of the Yiling Army.

302
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
And you are close

303
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
to our little emperor.

304
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Right?

305
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Don't forget

306
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
the secret of your birth.

307
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Only my father

308
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
can see that we work together.

309
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Now you are in the battle,

310
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
if anything happens to me,

311
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I'm afraid you will be defeated.

312
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I have to avoid you

313
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
to gain you

314
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
a good chance.

315
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
No.

316
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
The promise is gone.

317
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
The grudge is gone.

318
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
The love is gone.

319
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
No.

320
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I'm not afraid of the danger.

321
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I'm sorry.

322
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Are you me or the fake?

323
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
You and me.

324
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
A step is like a storm.

325
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Break through the heaven and earth.

326
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Drink the wine of life.

327
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
A step is like a fire.

328
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I look back at the youth.

329
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I look back at the life.

330
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I hold my sword.

331
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I'm in the middle of the world.

332
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
The end of the dark night.

333
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I'm the loneliest dreamer in the world.

334
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I look back at the youth.
