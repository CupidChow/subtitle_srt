00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
If you dare to lie to me,

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I will kill you.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I dare not.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I dare not.

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The wind is getting worse.

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Even the child is crying.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Is he peeing his pants?

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Why is it a girl?

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Where is the fifth prince?

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Xia...

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
After the birth of the Queen of Xia,

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
is she the princess of the Xia Dynasty?

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The princess...

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The general will be coming tomorrow.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The sixth and fifth princes will discuss about the marriage.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
If we report this to the King,

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm afraid we won't be able to live.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
From now on,

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
your identity will be the fifth prince.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
We will live together,

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
and live together.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Your Majesty.

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Your Majesty, you haven't eaten for days.

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You must be starving.

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Your favorite, the big dumpling.

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Eat it.

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm starving.

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Last night, Mr. Pei sent me

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
braised pork and lamb leg.

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Now I'm still holding on.

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Aren't you hungry?

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Your Majesty, are you okay?

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
What's wrong?

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I've been starving for days.

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I need to eat something.

39
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Have some porridge first.

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You scared me.

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
That's right.

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Your Majesty,

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
has Pei Zhang Yin

44
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
visited you these days?

45
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
He comes every night.

46
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
He came once or twice.

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Did he

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
mention anything?

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
He didn't say anything special.

50
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
That's good.

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Aunt,

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I recently found a book

53
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
that's very interesting.

54
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's called The Legend of the Pervert.

55
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
The Legend of the Pervert?

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I've never heard of this kind of book.

57
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
The pervert in this book

58
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
has a special feeling for Consort Chong.

59
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Do you think

60
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
the pervert likes women too?

61
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Of course.

62
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Men who follow them are men too.

63
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Of course they will...

64
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Did Pei Zhang Yin

65
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
do anything to you?

66
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
No.

67
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I just randomly asked what's in the book.

68
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
What's in the book?

69
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Where is it? I'll take a look.

70
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I haven't finished reading it.

71
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'll give it to you after I finish reading it.

72
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Did His Majesty

73
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
do anything to you?

74
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Your Majesty,

75
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
what's the feeling

76
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
that Consort Chong has for the pervert?

77
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Well...

78
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
She seems to have fallen in love with the pervert.

79
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And then?

80
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
She was a little scared.

81
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
So she left the pervert

82
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
and went away from her.

83
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
That's it.

84
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Well...

85
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
A pervert

86
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
can't bring real happiness to people.

87
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's not wise to

88
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
take a long time to find the truth.

89
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Your Majesty,

90
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
what are you reading?

91
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
A woman's story.

92
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
This is a very interesting point of view.

93
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Really?

94
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Do you think it's feasible?

95
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Your Excellency, Your Excellency,

96
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Your Excellency,

97
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Your Excellency,

98
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Your Excellency,

99
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Your Excellency,

100
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Your Excellency,

101
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Your Excellency,

102
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Your Excellency,

103
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Your Excellency,

104
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I am here today

105
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
to discuss something important with His Majesty.

106
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
This is the daughter of Gao Shangshu.

107
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
The tenth of this month is a good day.

108
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
After you marry her,

109
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
His Majesty will take her

110
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
to the harem on that day.

111
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Take her to the harem?

112
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
His Majesty is just in his prime.

113
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It's time to change the harem.

114
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It seems that I'm not

115
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
a good puppet.

116
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
When I get married,

117
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
and have a son,

118
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
he will be my son-in-law.

119
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Is His Majesty dissatisfied?

120
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Of course he is.

121
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Gao Qianji is a beauty at first sight.

122
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Thank you for your help,

123
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
but I'm still thinking about you.

124
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's my duty to share your burden.

125
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I congratulate you in advance.

126
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'd like to see

127
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
how His Majesty will get along with Gao Qianji.

128
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It seems that Lord Pei is free recently.

129
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Of course.

130
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I think His Majesty is looking forward

131
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
to this marriage.

132
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I can't push this.

133
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
The more I don't want to be a concubine,

134
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
the more I'm suspicious.

135
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I can only take one step.

136
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It's over.

137
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
What should I do?

138
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I don't have this kind of power.

139
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I don't have this kind of experience.

140
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Lord Pei, please help me think of a way.

141
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
To be honest,

142
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I don't have any experience in this.

143
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I...

144
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I forgot it in a hurry.

145
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Or I'll burn the palace.

146
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
It's rare

147
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
to see you in such a hurry.

148
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Ouch!

149
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

150
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm a little nervous.

151
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I broke the wine pot.

152
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
But I can't waste it.

153
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Please drink this

154
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
with me.

155
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Why are you taking off your clothes?

156
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Of course,

157
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I want to serve His Majesty.

158
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Serve His Majesty?

159
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Serve His Majesty?

160
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Lord Pei,

161
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
please think of a way.

162
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'm begging you.

163
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
How about

164
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
burning the palace?

165
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Okay.

166
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I can't use it.

167
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'm so unlucky.

168
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I accidentally

169
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
burned them both.

170
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
How can I live?

171
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I can't use it.

172
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I can't use it.

173
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I can't use it.

174
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I can't use it.

175
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
What if we burn them both?

176
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Then

177
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
we'll think of another way.

178
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Okay.

179
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
How about

180
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
telling them

181
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
that there is a

182
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
meteor shower

183
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
that is rare to see for a thousand years?

184
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Okay.

185
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Let's watch the meteor shower together.

186
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'll think of a way.

187
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Isn't this a good idea?

188
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

189
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
The palace's teacher,

190
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Aunt, taught me

191
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
how to serve Your Majesty.

192
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I'm willing to be a servant

193
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
and serve Your Majesty.

194
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
No need.

195
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I remember

196
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
that there are a lot of memorials.

197
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Go to bed early.

198
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Your Majesty doesn't like me.

199
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
To tell you the truth,

200
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I never like girls

201
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
because

202
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I like eunuchs.

203
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You like eunuchs?

204
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Your Majesty, you like this.

205
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
But what should we do?

206
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
The water can't quench your thirst.

207
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I'll take your medicine.

208
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Medicine?

209
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
What medicine?

210
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Your Majesty,

211
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
please forgive me.

212
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
What did you drink?

213
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

214
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
It's just

215
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
something that

216
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
will make you and me happy tonight.

217
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I'll take it.

218
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I'll take it.

219
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It's just

220
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
something that

221
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
will make you and me happy tonight.

222
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Your Majesty,

223
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
you can't escape.

224
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Just follow me.

225
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Okay?

226
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Mr. Pei,

227
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
why are you here?

228
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Your Majesty,

229
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
you're poisoned.

230
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
The fire in the morning is burning.

231
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Love and hate are like the wind and the moon.

232
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It's not good.

233
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
People's vows are gentle.

234
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Hating and grudging are like the stars in the sky.

235
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Then you'll help me to detoxify.

236
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I've tried my best to be a good person.

237
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I'm sorry.

238
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Are you me or a fake?

239
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
You and me.

240
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Why are you standing there?

241
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Come and help me.

242
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Mr. Pei,

243
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
hot water is here.

244
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
How is His Majesty?

245
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
His Majesty is fine now.

246
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Take good care of him.

247
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Yes.

248
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
His Majesty is very hot.

249
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
His Majesty is very hot.

250
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
His Majesty

251
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
is still in the house.

252
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
His Majesty

253
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
is still in the house.

254
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Is His Majesty

255
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
still in the house?

256
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Is His Majesty

257
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
still in the house?

258
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Hating and grudging are like the stars in the sky.

259
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It's not good.

260
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Hating and grudging are like the stars in the sky.

261
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Then you'll help me to detoxify.

262
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I've tried my best to be a good person.

263
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I've tried my best to be a good person.

264
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I've tried my best to be a good person.

265
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I've tried my best to be a good person.

266
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I've tried my best to be a good person.

267
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I've tried my best to be a good person.

268
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I've tried my best to be a good person.

269
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I've tried my best to be a good person.

270
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I've tried my best to be a good person.

271
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I've tried my best to be a good person.

272
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I've tried my best to be a good person.

273
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I've tried my best to be a good person.

274
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I've tried my best to be a good person.

275
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I've tried my best to be a good person.

276
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I've tried my best to be a good person.

277
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I've tried my best to be a good person.
