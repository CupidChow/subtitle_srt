00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Manreslai

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,680
Broker

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:13,400
Episode 38

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,080
Dingyuan

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,280
Come and look.

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,600
Hurry and come and look.

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,960
Hurry and come and look.

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:21,760
Hurry and come and look.

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,120
Hurry and come and look.

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,280
What is this?

11
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:25,720
What does it say?

12
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,680
Hurry and come and look...

13
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,400
The Lord of the Fuguo is shocked.

14
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,000
His Majesty is shocked and is going to be the first emperor?

15
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,080
The Lord of the Fuguo is shocked.

16
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,480
His Majesty is dying.

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:39,680
This...

18
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,520
Lord of the Fuguo.

19
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,280
What are you doing?

20
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,480
The court trial has just ended.

21
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,960
The public is talking about the imperial concubine.

22
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,000
His Majesty is so clever.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,800
How could there be such a ridiculous rumor?

24
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,520
You're very clever.

25
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,880
You want to use public opinion

26
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,440
to make me unable to do anything to you.

27
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,400
These days, I've been very unhappy

28
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,520
and very depressed.

29
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,160
What should I do?

30
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,920
He shouldn't have killed me.

31
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,840
You think I really don't dare to kill you?

32
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:24,720
I...

33
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,560
Don't forget.

34
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,520
I gave you this position.

35
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,320
I can kill you if I want.

36
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,000
I don't mind at all

37
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,160
to make you disappear from this world.

38
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,040
Look at you now.

39
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,240
I feel so happy.

40
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,600
Here you are.

41
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,160
You're faster than I thought.

42
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,280
The Seven Stars are old.

43
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,040
His heart will break soon.

44
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,000
It's like he's possessed.

45
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,800
Shen Zhi.

46
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,560
It's time to leave for Bixian.

47
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,400
Godfather.

48
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,080
This is a bad omen.

49
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,840
He's disobedient.

50
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,520
Unlock the poison.

51
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,480
If I don't give it to him,

52
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,880
I can only take the child.

53
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,160
Now, for the sake of this little godfather,

54
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,480
I have to kill you and me?

55
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,360
You're really the opposite.

56
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,800
So what?

57
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,840
You're a traitor.

58
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,440
Traitor.

59
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,360
Did you really think I was your son?

60
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,640
Did you really believe me?

61
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,480
Believe you?

62
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,040
How can I believe you?

63
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,360
Unless you give me the Tiger Manor of the Yiling Army now.

64
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,200
That's right.

65
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,480
Yes.

66
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,720
Godfather taught me not to trust anyone since I was a child.

67
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,560
So you never trusted me.

68
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,800
As long as I don't obey,

69
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,480
you'll threaten me with the identity of the previous emperor.

70
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,480
In your heart,

71
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,520
I'm just your pawn.

72
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,520
I want to offend you.

73
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,720
That's because you poisoned the little emperor.

74
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,600
It doesn't hurt to know that I'm hurt.

75
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,120
Don't you know that

76
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,360
if you kill him now, you'll make a rumor?

77
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,160
The whole world will be in your hands.

78
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,280
You want to drag your son to die with you, right?

79
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,000
You said it for a long time.

80
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,560
You're still trying to save him, right?

81
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,160
Fine.

82
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,160
He's just a puppet emperor.

83
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,520
Kill him.

84
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,320
If things don't go well,

85
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,040
the world will punish us.

86
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,840
We'll live together.

87
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,360
We'll die together.

88
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,200
This little emperor

89
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,960
doesn't know how to retreat.

90
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,200
How dare he hurt the Lord of the Manor?

91
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,560
He turned himself into a useless flag.

92
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,360
He'll die if he dies.

93
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,680
I know a little about the heart bone cancer.

94
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,280
After the poison, it does trigger heart disease.

95
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,520
But the face will produce red blood and cause a rash.

96
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,400
But I know

97
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,480
there's a piece of medicine in the market.

98
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,920
The market has a piece of medicine.

99
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,600
It's good for the makeup.

100
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,160
I'll call him here to cover up for His Majesty.

101
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,560
Father, please wait.

102
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,280
Lord Hei.

103
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,400
Go and get the medicine from the market.

104
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,560
And

105
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,280
go to the God-like Camp.

106
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,280
Yes.

107
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,880
She's a woman.

108
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,960
She set up a shop.

109
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,440
I'm quite interested in this.

110
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,680
Lord Hei, you're not a woman.

111
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,960
You're not a man.

112
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,120
You're a man who deserves to be trusted.

113
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,280
Lord Hei.

114
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,360
Lord Hei.

115
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,200
The medicine is here.

116
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,080
Let's go.

117
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,280
Father, the medicine is here.

118
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,680
God-like total.

119
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,920
God-like total.

120
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,440
How stupid I am!

121
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,040
I don't like to do it.

122
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,720
ironically

123
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,320
Zhenzhi, please forgive me for not considering it

124
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,360
, I've let you to misunderstand

125
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,360
me again, of course I know

126
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,800
I have left his life to the lips of people in the world

127
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,840
and I do things to let him bear in mind

128
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,880
don't forget who this responsibility belongs to

129
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,400
and next time, I willŐCHUCKLE

130
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,440
I have a way to get rid of him.

131
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,480
The outfits

132
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,120
This year, the 그리고

133
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,560
Song Bantang is the final winner.

134
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,600
Ning Jingyi,

135
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,120
I was wrong.

136
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,880
You don't need to be so stubborn.

137
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,240
You're the biggest storm

138
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,440
in the world.

139
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,560
I'm still alive.

140
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,760
I've promised.

141
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,720
Should you thank me

142
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,280
for not killing him?

143
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:53,880
I...

144
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,080
Forget it.

145
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,720
I won't argue with you.

146
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,960
I'm here

147
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,640
to ask for your favour.

148
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:11,760
Your Majesty.

149
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,280
Aunt.

150
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,360
Aunt.

151
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:16,840
Your Majesty.

152
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,200
Let her go.

153
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,080
Why are you after me?

154
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,000
Let her go.

155
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,960
Your Majesty, you don't think

156
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,960
I'm using Jingxian

157
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,480
to threaten you, do you?

158
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,440
I'm clear about Jingxian.

159
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,160
I want you

160
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,600
to marry me

161
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,840
and Aunt Jingxian.

162
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,480
I won't allow her

163
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,800
to be your enemy.

164
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,680
You can humiliate me

165
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,080
however you want.

166
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,960
Let her go.

167
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,840
Humiliate me?

168
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,720
I really want Jingxian.

169
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,880
But if I can

170
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,120
make you suffer,

171
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,200
I'll feel happy.

172
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,920
I have a habit.

173
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,240
If I can't get her,

174
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,040
I'd rather destroy her.

175
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:09,880
After all,

176
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,000
you still owe me a life.

177
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,920
If you think it over,

178
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,200
I don't have much patience.

179
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,440
Fine.

180
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,440
I'm willing to prove it to Zhuminhua

181
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,600
as long as you let Aunt go.

182
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,600
I beg you.

183
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,840
What?

184
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,480
Do you want to

185
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,280
make our little emperor happy?

186
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,320
Lord Fuguo,

187
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,800
allow me to say something.

188
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,000
Your Majesty,

189
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,040
in my life,

190
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I've been the judge of others.

191
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,960
But today,

192
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,560
I want to make a decision for myself.

193
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,800
I'm willing to marry Fuguo.

194
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,200
No.

195
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,480
If Your Majesty

196
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,120
really wants me to be happy,

197
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,160
you should let us be together.

198
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,880
We've been married for years.

199
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,880
Allow me to persuade Your Majesty.

200
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,160
Don't go against Fuguo.

201
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,600
Let's get married forThey aren't ready yet.

202
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,600
Aunt,

203
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,480
dad and great-grandson...
