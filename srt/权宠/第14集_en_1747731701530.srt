1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,320
Pl JM

2
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,520
How can I break through

3
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,960
the стен Sentry's lock?

4
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,440
Sir.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,640
Your Majesty.

6
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,880
What brings you

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,240
to the Palace so late at night?

8
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,040
I heard that the capital is busy these days.

9
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,080
I want to go out

10
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,160
but I don't want to bother Pei Zhaoyi.

11
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,880
I'm ordered to take him out secretly.

12
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,040
Please forgive me.

13
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,280
Mr. Huo,

14
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,720
are you taking His Majesty

15
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,160
to meet someone you shouldn't meet

16
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,760
to deal with us?

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,640
Yes.

18
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,000
Don't be nervous, Mr. Huo.

19
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,120
First,

20
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,360
as the head of the family,

21
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,000
I care about His Majesty's safety.

22
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,200
Second, I don't want His Majesty

23
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,920
to suffer again because of Zhuo Fu.

24
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,240
Since you care about His Majesty so much,

25
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,840
why didn't you

26
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,960
take him out in the court?

27
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:24,480
Come.

28
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,120
Mr. Huo,

29
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,080
please do things for His Majesty.

30
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,320
You have to carefully take actions

31
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,920
and you must not have any crumbs left.

32
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,160
I believe you will handle this properly

33
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,600
and it won't intrude the suspicion of Zhuo Fu.

34
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,320
His behavior

35
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,040
really gives me a Shaharyli rush.

36
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,160
Year of the Havoc.

37
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,480
Put the doors and windows shut.

38
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,480
Beware of thieves and thieves!

39
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,920
Isn't this the legendary

40
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,000
Fire Emblem?

41
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,720
Run!

42
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,280
Your Majesty,

43
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,480
I've checked the fire tonight.

44
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,320
But I couldn't find anything.

45
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,480
The fire

46
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,360
has no source.

47
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,440
It's very strange.

48
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,160
Your Majesty,

49
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,680
it's said that it's the Fire Emblem of King Yan.

50
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,000
It was hard to detect it a few days ago.

51
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,080
Now it's so strange.

52
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,320
I'm afraid it's an ominous sign.

53
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,280
Your Majesty,

54
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,960
the court

55
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,280
has another guess about this.

56
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,800
I don't know if I should say it

57
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,720
or not.

58
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,200
It's okay if you say it.

59
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,560
It's said that it's the fire

60
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,720
that caused the disaster.

61
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,080
The two bags were stolen.

62
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,360
The late emperor was furious.

63
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,400
King Yan's Fire Emblem

64
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,360
is to take the state of Zhuo

65
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,440
to the capital to ask for punishment.

66
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,120
It's just a rumor.

67
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,120
Mr. Zheng,

68
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,120
you're an official of the court.

69
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,280
You don't care about your talent

70
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,200
in the court.

71
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,080
But you're obsessed with rumors.

72
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,120
You think His Majesty is a three-year-old kid

73
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,560
and you want to hear about these strange rumors?

74
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,160
Besides, the fire is on the street.

75
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,840
It has nothing to do with me.

76
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,640
Isn't it obvious enough?

77
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,840
The fire that burned

78
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
is you.

79
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,400
Before His Majesty's death,

80
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,560
he was promoted to the state of Zhuo.

81
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,080
He will supervise the state.

82
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,920
After the late emperor's death,

83
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,440
you're all

84
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,920
a rumor to the state.

85
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,080
Do you think

86
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,320
the late emperor is dead

87
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,320
and the rumor is gone,

88
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,880
and you can bully me?

89
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,440
Or do you think

90
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,960
you don't need to care about me?

91
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,000
You've worked hard for the country.

92
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,080
If you're ridiculed because you're an official,

93
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,080
it's my fault.

94
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,440
In my opinion,

95
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,760
you should help the court

96
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,240
to complete the spirit.

97
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,200
You should be famous

98
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,160
in the world.

99
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,640
Your Majesty,

100
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,200
I'm just an official.

101
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,160
It's inappropriate

102
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,560
to be so strict.

103
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,160
Besides,

104
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,800
the officials in the court

105
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,080
are very kind to me.

106
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,840
You can help the court to complete the spirit

107
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,960
not only to pray for your father,

108
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,040
but also to the people of the world.

109
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,600
You've done a great job.

110
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,720
Those who object

111
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,280
are you

112
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,760
trying to do something bad to our country?

113
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,680
You would result in

114
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,160
raising an evil underfoot.

115
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:19,760
I want to

116
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,720
teach you the art of Exhaustion.

117
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,160
Thank you, Your Majesty.

118
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,080
eines of my mind

119
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,440
asked the tax sharing department

120
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,440
to Kingdom's dealt with the 생각 pastor

121
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,560
to complete the spirit

122
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,720
to complete the latest

123
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,320
coinage to the Nico Bann gegangen

124
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,600
from her intend to hear

125
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,760
mine bike

126
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,640
Your Majesty is wise.

127
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,880
I believe that under the care of Lord Fu,

128
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,920
the plague will be gone soon

129
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,520
and the refugees will be able to return to their homes.

130
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,800
The money for the charity ceremony

131
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,640
will be sent to the mansion in a few days.

132
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,040
Do you know what to do?

133
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,720
Send it to the Ministry of Works

134
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,320
and send it to the private bank.

135
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,720
The little emperor has made some progress.

136
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,560
Lord Pei is here.

137
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,560
Lord Pei, what's the matter?

138
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,760
Your Majesty,

139
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,160
the date when you asked Qingtian to make a plan

140
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,000
to pray for Lord Fu

141
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
has been set.

142
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,600
It's seven days later.

143
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,760
Okay.

144
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,280
I know.

145
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,280
Lord Pei,

146
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,640
is there anything else?

147
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,880
Your Majesty, you've been so kind to Lord Zhou.

148
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,600
Your Majesty, you've been so kind to Lord Zhou.

149
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,200
I'm afraid that you're just playing tricks.

150
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,440
Lord Fu won't really believe you.

151
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,120
Kind to me?

152
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,480
Lord Pei,

153
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,160
you've confused me.

154
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,560
The two ministers in the court

155
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,960
sang black faces for you

156
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,040
just to help you

157
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,520
please Lord Zhou.

158
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,440
I'm just afraid that Lord Zhou will make them angry.

159
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,600
Besides,

160
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,120
it's a matter of duty.

161
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,040
Is Lord Yan

162
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,000
also playing tricks with me?

163
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,000
Lord Yan's lamp

164
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,120
is just a firefly.

165
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,440
What is a firefly?

166
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,880
I just want to remind you

167
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,320
that Lord Fu was killed by Zhuo Minghua

168
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,440
and was severely injured.

169
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,880
To repair the ancestral hall for him,

170
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,560
he must be killed

171
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,760
and rebuild the valley.

172
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,200
The imperial edict has been sent

173
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,440
and the flag is set again.

174
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,360
ור

175
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,560
I don't know

176
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,880
what you think.

177
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,000
Getting trickier, scolded more and more.

178
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,160
Your Majesty, do you know

179
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,360
what thebo shading thing is?

180
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,920
It's not until 3 days did he die.

181
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:57,960
Your Majesty.

182
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,560
Luozhi

183
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,800
is just abeking on me.

184
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,360
You made it up to Eunuch Zhuo

185
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,520
and came to me to get closer.

186
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,280
Your left and right feng yuan

187
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,360
is really a great achievement.

188
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,400
Since Your Majesty insist,

189
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,440
I'll take my leave.

190
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,040
The End

191
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,400
You're all so busy.

192
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,600
Your Excellency,

193
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,040
these are from the states of Lingnan, Zhizhou,

194
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,000
Mobei,

195
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,520
and the General's Mansion of Zheng.

196
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,440
They're for the gold and silver of the gold-making.

197
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,680
Send them to the private bank.

198
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,360
Yes.

199
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,400
Come here.

200
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,400
Hurry.

201
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,680
Send these to the private bank.

202
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,720
Hurry up.

203
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,280
The Gold and Silver of the Gold-making

204
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,040
Your Excellency,

205
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,760
something bad happened.

206
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,040
It's just a small accident.

207
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,400
Let's talk about it later.

208
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,640
The private bank of Begonia Forest is in a bad shape.

209
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,360
What?

210
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,200
Where's my stuff?

211
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,200
Those bandits used explosives

212
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,080
before they broke into the mine.

213
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,880
Fortunately, the private bank was heavily guarded.

214
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,200
The bandits finally retreated.

215
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,320
The money is safe now.

216
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,040
The bandits?

217
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:30,720
Yes.

218
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,840
We caught a fire.

219
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,560
The man said

220
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,600
someone said

221
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,200
the gold and silver of the gold-making

222
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,320
is hidden in Begonia Forest.

223
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,600
They were half-truths and half-truths.

224
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,640
But it seems that someone was guarding the private bank

225
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,600
and took the opportunity to take the money.

226
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,280
That's why they're crying.

227
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,600
There are few people in Begonia Forest.

228
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,200
There are many snakes and insects.

229
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,520
Ordinary people dare not to set foot in it.

230
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,840
How did the rumor spread?

231
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,080
I don't know.

232
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,720
Go and check it.

233
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,160
Get out.

234
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,320
Father, calm down.

235
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,320
I know you're here.

236
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,440
Why don't you tell us the truth?

237
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,200
I don't know.

238
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,840
I have a private bank.

239
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,120
I heard about the Begonia Forest.

240
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,240
It's been a mess recently.

241
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,720
Three forces

242
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,080
are all going to be destroyed.

243
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,400
Plus,

244
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,600
the bandits are running around.

245
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,160
Father, guess

246
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,880
what they will spread.

247
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,880
They will spread that

248
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,240
they have set foot in Begonia Forest

249
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,680
and that there is treasure.

250
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,720
Who is behind this?

251
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,120
Father, are you suspecting me?

252
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,560
How could I suspect you?

253
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,680
The private bank is always secretive.

254
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,080
And I raised these private soldiers

255
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,280
and put my life on the line.

256
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,000
I didn't expect these bandits

257
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,080
to still think about me.

258
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I'm thinking

259
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,320
if the officials

260
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,240
were so brave,

261
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,480
I think they wouldn't dare to do it.

262
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,960
What do you mean?

263
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,200
The warehouse is not safe anymore.

264
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,560
I have to secretly transfer the money.

265
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,920
For example, Lord Huting will be arrested.

266
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,560
Then there will be no warehouse.

267
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,800
Whoever dares to attack

268
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,480
will be caught in the trap.

269
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,640
It's a serious crime to tear off Lord Huting.

270
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,440
Father, don't say that.

271
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,880
Lord Huting is also a thief.

272
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,000
Shen Zhi,

273
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,120
the more you grow up,

274
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,760
the more cowardly you are.

275
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,600
Lord Pei is here.

276
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:02,960
Your Highness.

277
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,800
Lord Zhang Ying, how are you?

278
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,880
The incident of Lord Pei's private bank

279
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,200
is related to His Majesty, right?

280
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,000
Lord Zhang Ying,

281
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,920
why are you so quiet?

282
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,160
What private bank?

283
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,280
The private bank is where Lord Huting's heart is.

284
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,480
When you are planning this behind my back,

285
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,600
if Lord Huting finds out,

286
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,600
he will kill you.

287
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,520
Lord Zhang Ying,

288
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,000
please be careful.

289
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,440
Half live...

290
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:04,840
Half live.

291
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,320
You beat me too.

292
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,880
Where am I going?

293
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,560
You are shouting.

294
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,800
You...

295
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:05,800
I am in the midst of a chaotic world, at the end of the night

296
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,800
I am the loneliest man in the world

297
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:14,800
I look back as I walk forward
