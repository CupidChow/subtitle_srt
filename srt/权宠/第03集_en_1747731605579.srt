00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,500
Episode 1

3
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,000
Here.

4
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:18,800
The jade dragon soup,

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:19,900
the broken pigeon egg,

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
the shrimp roll with jade,

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,900
the steamed meatball.

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:22,900
Let's go.

9
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,600
Your Majesty, it's not right.

10
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,300
I said it's right.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Here, Gugu.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Your identity is different now.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You can't be so childish anymore.

14
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,000
Delicious.

15
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,000
Gugu, I want to eat your...

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Slow down. Slow down.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
No one is going to fight with you.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You can't hit the target if you're not strong.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It's hard to get you.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Remember.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
When you were born,

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
you knew the country would be destroyed.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You only have one goal in life.

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
That is to revenge.

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
To avenge your death.

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Enjoy your meal, Your Majesty.

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Gugu.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I was wrong.

29
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,000
We promised to run away from the country together.

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,500
It was about to come true.

31
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,000
But it was destroyed.

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I know.

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You would not take this step.

34
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,500
But today,

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
you're sitting in the most important position in the world.

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You're the only one who can do this.

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I can't let you go.

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You have to be careful.

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You're sitting in the most important position in the world.

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm afraid you can't keep your daughter's body.

41
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I know.

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Your Majesty.

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Let's run away.

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Run away?

45
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
How?

46
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
These years,

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I've been worried about you.

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I've been thinking about you for years.

49
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Finally, I've figured out a way out of the palace.

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's a way out.

51
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
But Gugu.

52
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
If we run away now,

53
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
would it be too risky?

54
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Yes.

55
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
But the palace is like a chess game.

56
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
We only have two chess pieces left.

57
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
If you want to live, you can only appear in the middle.

58
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Maybe it's the only way out.

59
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You're right.

60
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Your Majesty.

61
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
This incense is for the god of peace.

62
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It's often used by His Majesty before he goes to bed.

63
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's so late.

64
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Is there anything else to do with the seal?

65
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Yes.

66
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm here to serve His Majesty.

67
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You can let Aunt Li do this.

68
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It's not a trouble for you.

69
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Yes.

70
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I've always served you in such a small matter.

71
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I think you're used to it.

72
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Then you can start to get used to me from today.

73
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
After all, it's my duty to serve you.

74
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
No need.

75
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You can leave.

76
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
His Majesty is so flustered.

77
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Could it be that there's something hidden?

78
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Pei Zhang Ni.

79
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
No, Aunt.

80
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Aunt.

81
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You can leave.

82
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Your Majesty.

83
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I have something to tell him.

84
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
What's wrong?

85
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
What's wrong?

86
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Zifang's Mama.

87
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
border ofiantian山

88
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
State稍前

89
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Spare some turns

90
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
and then wait until they finishienne the Compendium.

91
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Your Highness.

92
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,960
Can you promise me

93
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
to serve me?

94
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,000
What request do you have for me?

95
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm not a good person.

96
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm not a good person.

97
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm not a good person.

98
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
The one who serves me

99
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
will naturally

100
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
meet my likes.

101
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Actually,

102
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I've already found out

103
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
that Mr. Pei

104
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
is much more

105
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
fond of me.

106
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Your Majesty,

107
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
what exactly do you want to say?

108
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
What I mean is

109
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
naturally

110
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
it's Yu Luan Ze.

111
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Is that okay?

112
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Yes.

113
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I don't know how to use this knife.

114
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You should let Aunt Li

115
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
continue to serve His Majesty.

116
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Is that okay?

117
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Mr. Pei.

118
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Mr. Pei.

119
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Mr. Pei, there's a fight in the palace.

120
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Hurry and rest, Your Majesty.

121
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Who sent you here?

122
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You...

123
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Mr. Pei, you're here to kill me.

124
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Is His Majesty all right?

125
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Yes.

126
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Find a place to hide.

127
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Why is there a sound?

128
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I don't know.

129
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It's okay. Come out.

130
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Your Majesty.

131
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Come out.

132
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Fu Guo is here.

133
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Your Majesty,

134
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
there are many assassins tonight.

135
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
They're all dead bodies that are carefully trained.

136
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Fortunately, the defense in the palace was timely.

137
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Otherwise,

138
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
it would be unthinkable.

139
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Dead bodies?

140
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Who sent them?

141
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Please order the investigation.

142
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Otherwise,

143
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
we'll be in danger.

144
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Your Majesty is really smart.

145
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
The world's first war

146
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
has been broken by His Majesty.

147
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I've been dealing with this for more than two months.

148
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm forced to think about how to deal with it.

149
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Why is it called a jade-like situation?

150
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Aunt,

151
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
do you have another way to deal with this?

152
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'm not sure.

153
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
But I do have some ideas.

154
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Aunt,

155
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
do you think

156
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
there's a strange silence in the palace today?

157
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It must be because of the assassination

158
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
that the workers were a little cautious.

159
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Your Majesty, please spare my life.

160
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Why are you so flustered?

161
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
It's just a little tea.

162
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Why would I kill you?

163
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Yes.

164
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
If you don't tell me,

165
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I'll really kill you.

166
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I dare not say it.

167
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Your Majesty, please spare my life.

168
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Your Majesty, please spare my life.

169
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You thief!

170
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You'll die a terrible death

171
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
if you keep hiding in this world!

172
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Your Majesty, you shouldn't have come here.

173
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
What crime did they commit?

174
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
They all came to assassinate you.

175
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
That's the only way.

176
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Get out.

177
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Yes.

178
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Get out.

179
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You'll die if they don't.

180
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
You don't have to blame yourself.

181
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Really?

182
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Do you really think they should be killed?

183
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
They are all the Crown Prince who participated in the rebellion.

184
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Minister Pei,

185
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
you can tell me the truth.

186
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Can you really lie to yourself?

187
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Fine.

188
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
They are all the people who deserve to die.

189
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Zhang Yan Qing,

190
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Chuan Xi, Xun Fu,

191
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Wei Jie, Shui Huan,

192
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
and the other clansmen

193
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
jumped into the floodgates.

194
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
They almost died,

195
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
and saved the people of Liang Jiang.

196
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Zhao Chang Qi,

197
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Guang Luo Si, and Shu Zheng,

198
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
were in the hospital for the people,

199
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
and they were in the hospital for several days.

200
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
They were finally put into a life-long emergency.

201
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Shen Han Wu,

202
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
and Ping Xi Fu,

203
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
were killed on the battlefield

204
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
for the sake of the anti-Yan army.

205
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
They were killed in a single night.

206
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
And Yue Gui Shan,

207
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Ren Hai Bing,

208
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Yu Chang Ping,

209
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Minister Pei,

210
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
in your eyes,

211
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
they really deserve to be killed.

212
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Yes.

213
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
They deserve to be killed.

214
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Your Majesty,

215
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
now that you are in the high position,

216
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
we can't judge whether a person deserves to be killed

217
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
by what he has written on the paper.

218
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Why?

219
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It's because his master is standing by your side

220
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
and he is your strength to rule the world.

221
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
But they

222
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
were once

223
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
a good hand

224
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
for the people of Wei State.

225
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
What made them forget

226
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
the protection of Xiong Zhuo?

227
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
What made them be forced to fight against each other?

228
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
It's Liang Bo's master

229
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
and the evil Ning that he can't deal with.

230
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Even if they are wrong,

231
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
it's also your fault.

232
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Yes.

233
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It's your fault

234
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
for causing chaos

235
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
and defending the country

236
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
and changing the party.

237
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It's also my fault.

238
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
If His Majesty doesn't do it,

239
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
why don't you

240
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
make a fool of Feng Yun

241
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
and stir up trouble?

242
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Lord Pei.

243
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Lord Pei.

244
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
What is it that you want to see me for?

245
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
His Majesty has not been able to drink water for three days.

246
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
He has been losing weight.

247
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I'm really worried about his health.

248
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I'll go and have a look.

249
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Lord Pei.

250
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
His Majesty was young and ill.

251
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
He ate and vomited a lot.

252
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
His life was in danger.

253
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Later,

254
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I asked my servant to visit his family

255
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
and bring back the bean curd from the 12 sugar-water shops

256
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
in Qin'an Town.

257
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
After His Majesty ate it,

258
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
his illness disappeared.

259
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Can you ask Lord Pei to help

260
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
and ask him to bring it back?

261
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
How dare you ask him to do it?

262
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I dare not.

263
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
His Majesty treats me like a family.

264
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Seeing him like this,

265
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I'm really worried.

266
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
But I'm in the palace

267
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
and I dare not believe anyone else.

268
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Only Lord Pei

269
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
will take care of our mistress

270
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
in the palace.

271
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
He can go out of the palace and be free.

272
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
That's why I dared to ask.

273
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I beg you.

274
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I beg you.

275
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I beg you.

276
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I beg you.

277
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I'll send it tomorrow morning.

278
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Your Majesty.

279
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Your Majesty.

280
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Your Majesty.

281
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Your Majesty.
