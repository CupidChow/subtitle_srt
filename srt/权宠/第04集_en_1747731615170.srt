1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,400
privatization

2
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,640
start

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,320
Where can we find him?

4
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,360
All right.

5
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,240
Are you sir,

6
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,120
here?

7
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,960
Is anyone going in or out of 위해서?

8
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,600
Ms Li said His Majesty 설�specificly wanted to bow over the wealth,

9
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,000
so he changed rooms

10
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,360
for more than ten maids.

11
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,680
Than ten maids!

12
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,160
What time are we going in?

13
00:00:59,160 --> 00:00:59,840
Chief,

14
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,040
all gates and gates have been sealed.

15
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,320
We haven't found His Majesty's trace yet.

16
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,920
Where is the list of people who left the city today?

17
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,280
The list.

18
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,400
This incense is for calming the mind.

19
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,080
It can be used before sleeping.

20
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,280
This is the best incense

21
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,880
for the wedding.

22
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,600
It can also be used before sleeping.

23
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,560
It seems that you've left the city.

24
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,040
Do you think

25
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,000
there's still a place for you to stay?

26
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,120
Aunt,

27
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,040
we haven't found anything yet.

28
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,760
Let's have a rest.

29
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,480
Come.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,760
Have some water.

31
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,680
Have some water.

32
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,080
We've left the city at a certain time.

33
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,360
We've been following the mountain road for more than half a day.

34
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,280
I think they don't know

35
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,920
which direction we're going.

36
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,840
Let's have a rest.

37
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,480
Okay.

38
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,560
What are you thinking about?

39
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,680
Nothing.

40
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,880
It's been 20 years.

41
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,720
We've finally escaped from that place.

42
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,920
Even if it's a prison,

43
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,400
it's still a home for us

44
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,800
who have lived there for 20 years.

45
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,040
Aunt,

46
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,840
the place where you're staying is a home.

47
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,440
When we arrive at Linchuan Town,

48
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,680
we must go and taste what your aunt said.

49
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,440
It's a long trip.

50
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,040
Okay.

51
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:52,880
Let's go.

52
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,400
Here we go.

53
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,400
When I caught this sheep,

54
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,720
a wolf tried to steal my prey.

55
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,760
I'm a tiger.

56
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,200
You scared the wolf away.

57
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,400
Nice painting.

58
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,600
Is that handsome young man

59
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,040
looking at me?

60
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,720
Who are you?

61
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,160
Why are you here?

62
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:48,840
Sisters,

63
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,240
I'm here

64
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,840
to get out of the dusk.

65
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,040
Is there a place

66
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,160
nearby?

67
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,120
There are no hotels

68
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,920
in this 20-mile area.

69
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,320
Only our village can stay here.

70
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,200
Can I go to the village

71
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,360
with my aunt?

72
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,560
My aunt is nearby.

73
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,440
Your aunt can stay here.

74
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,040
But you can't.

75
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,280
It's not convenient for us to stay here.

76
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,440
Sisters, wait.

77
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,480
I'm a woman.

78
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,680
I'm a woman.

79
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,400
I'm back.

80
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,000
Are you done?

81
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,800
I'm starving.

82
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,320
You're back.

83
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,760
Be careful.

84
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,480
She's back again.

85
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,680
She's back.

86
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,920
Wait.

87
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,800
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

88
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,160
You go in first.

89
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,200
I have something to do.

90
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,080
Take it.

91
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:11,680
Take it.

92
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,000
Don't touch my sister.

93
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,560
What's wrong with you?

94
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,440
You like to bully girls.

95
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,000
You...

96
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,840
Come on.

97
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,800
Let's eat.

98
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,320
Let's share it.

99
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,040
Help yourself.

100
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,400
Xiaowu,

101
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,200
eat it.

102
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,480
Thank you.

103
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,200
Is this

104
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,200
the wild yam

105
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,120
that Sister Hui Fen made in the mountains?

106
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,320
She's the bravest.

107
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,400
Only she dares to run

108
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,280
to the mountains with bow and arrow.

109
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,680
Sisters are all great.

110
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,200
You can carry

111
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,680
such heavy things.

112
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:46,880
Of course.

113
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,560
Let me have some.

114
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,960
Today is our mountaineering day.

115
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,040
We're not as strong

116
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,240
as men.

117
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,240
Give me another bowl.

118
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:54,760
Come on.

119
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,920
It's a bit rude.

120
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,920
We just entered the village.

121
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,320
There seems to be no man in the village.

122
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,640
There's no man in the village.

123
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,040
The village's soldiers

124
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,280
were all captured and charged.

125
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,840
They were almost all killed outside.

126
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,760
The government even occupied our land.

127
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,160
Our own land

128
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,280
needs to be paid off to them now.

129
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,760
They even want to take over the land.

130
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,360
It's ridiculous.

131
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,320
We've never seen anything like this.

132
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,480
Sister, you're being too harsh.

133
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,280
Don't blame me.

134
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,720
Now,

135
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,000
there's only the land

136
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,880
left in the village.

137
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,560
Although he's young,

138
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,200
he's the only man in the village.

139
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,800
He's the village chief

140
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,840
of our Junlai Village.

141
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,960
I'm the village chief.

142
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,440
Sisters.

143
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,600
I'm sorry.

144
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,880
Our hilang have started breaking down.

145
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,720
Please come over.

146
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:57,920
//

147
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,000
And for the purple peach,

148
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,120
there's the ginseng tea.

149
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,040
So,

150
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,600
have youhedn't told your father

151
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,120
to anime two groups

152
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,680
of bastards

153
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,400
You must have been raised by the Fu family.

154
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,480
You must have been on the road

155
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,760
and came to our village

156
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,560
with an ungrateful name.

157
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:22,960
Yes.

158
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,800
We...

159
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,680
No?

160
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,000
No.

161
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,520
Misunderstanding.

162
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,320
Come on.

163
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,280
Eat more.

164
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:31,680
Okay.

165
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,520
Eat more.

166
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,080
Okay.

167
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,240
She is a woman.

168
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,360
Luckily, she is a woman.

169
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,000
Bear with it.

170
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,520
It will be better soon.

171
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,720
Sister Junlan.

172
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,440
Why is Junlai Village

173
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,160
called the widow village?

174
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,440
It's a long time ago.

175
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,320
I wasn't from Junlai Village.

176
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,520
I was a girl who liked art.

177
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,800
When I was a year old,

178
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,560
I married under the arrangement of the Mu family.

179
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,960
But I had to

180
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,800
show up in front of the people.

181
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,880
In the end, I was in a bad mood.

182
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,520
The Fu family thought I was unruly

183
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,800
and made me a widow.

184
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,120
The Mu family thought I was a bad name

185
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,120
and turned me away.

186
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,600
I went to the river

187
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,800
without any way out.

188
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,920
Sister Guifen brought me back.

189
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,480
You...

190
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,760
Slow down.

191
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,000
What are you looking at?

192
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,720
What are you looking at?

193
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,440
Stupid girl.

194
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,400
You are bullied.

195
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,320
I'll help you get out.

196
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,280
If you don't go anywhere,

197
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,280
go back to the village with me.

198
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,720
If anyone bullies you again,

199
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,960
I won't let him go.

200
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,600
He brought me back to Junlai Village

201
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,720
and encouraged me to continue to work and save people.

202
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,160
Here,

203
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,080
everyone treats me as a real doctor.

204
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,440
I don't know how this thing

205
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,200
was declared out.

206
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,960
In addition to the disaster of the military service,

207
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,240
the sisters from all over the country

208
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,680
came to the village to make a sacrifice.

209
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,200
Gradually, it became a widow village.

210
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,560
Everyone accompanied and relied on each other.

211
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,480
It's really good

212
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,400
to spend the rest of our lives together.

213
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,800
When I get old,

214
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,000
I may have the opportunity to join you.

215
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,280
Wu.

216
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,920
It's time to get up.

217
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,400
Uncle, let me sleep for a while.

218
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,480
I know you were exhausted yesterday.

219
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,440
But it's almost noon.

220
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,200
Get up and eat something first.

221
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,320
Help!

222
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,360
Someone is killed!

223
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,400
Someone is killed!

224
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,800
Someone is killed!

225
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,520
Someone is killed!

226
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,040
Someone is killed!

227
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:53,840
That's right!

228
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,720
Get out of the way!

229
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:55,840
Stop talking!

230
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,800
I'm raising people!

231
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,800
Get out of the way!

232
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,800
Someone is killed!

233
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,520
Someone is killed!

234
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,600
Why are you all so cruel?

235
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,280
Sun Zai Shang,

236
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,440
you only took my money last year.

237
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,400
You don't admit it today.

238
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,400
You still don't admit that you're a man.

239
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,360
That's right!

240
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,480
This has nothing to do with the previous generation.

241
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,400
I just brought my father here.

242
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,160
You...

243
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,720
You sold this cloth in the market, right?

244
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,880
We know it.

245
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,160
Is there any problem?

246
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,720
What are you looking at?

247
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,800
You rascal!

248
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,400
Open your mouth!

249
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,720
You two!

250
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,760
You're all dead!

251
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,760
Someone is killed!

252
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,760
Someone is killed!

253
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,280
Someone is killed!

254
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:39,960
No!

255
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,720
Let go of me!

256
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,360
Get out of the way!

257
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,320
Back off!

258
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,200
Let go of me!

259
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:43,680
Let go of me!

260
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,440
Let go of me!

261
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,680
Let go of me!

262
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,200
Let go of me!

263
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,040
Let go of me!

264
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,360
Let go of me!

265
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:48,960
Let go of me!

266
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,080
You're all rascals!

267
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,080
You hit me!

268
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,120
Let go of me!

269
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,120
Let go of me!

270
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:54,840
Let go of me!

271
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,680
I'll beat you up!

272
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,720
How dare you hurt me?

273
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,680
We didn't.

274
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,000
You started it first.

275
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,400
How could you come to the village

276
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,480
and arrest people?

277
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,440
Is there any other way?

278
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:13,840
Yes.

279
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,040
I'm telling you now.

280
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,200
Qin Nan County has just issued a new order.

281
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,560
Without any advice,

282
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,800
you can't sell your cloths.

283
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,560
The whole Qin Nan

284
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,200
is the only one who can sell it.

285
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,400
You sell it in private.

286
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,800
This is a mess.

287
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,720
It's reasonable to arrest you.

288
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,440
How dare you hurt people now?

289
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,920
You deserve it.

290
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,080
Take him away.

291
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:39,920
Stop!

292
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,280
Who did this to you?

293
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,080
It's you!

294
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:46,720
Who did this to you?

295
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,200
I'd like to tell you a firstly oftened story.

296
00:13:49,760 --> 00:14:01,580
You

297
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,780
Los Abd tasks

298
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:03,920
have kimono

299
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,280
in the whole world.

300
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,080
No.

301
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,280
Is there anything dirty?

302
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,480
You're bad guys.

303
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,080
The eyes of heaven are watching you.

304
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,480
Lord Guanchao,

305
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,680
I think we should forget about it today.

306
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,080
But the people from Junlai Village

307
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,680
are not allowed to leave their bodies.

308
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,680
We must

309
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,480
give them an explanation.

310
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,280
No matter who they are,

311
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,880
we can't protect them forever.

312
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,080
Let's go.

313
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,280
No.

314
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,280
No.

315
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,680
No matter who you are, be gentle.

316
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,080
No matter how grieved you are,

317
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,280
you're as pure as the star.

318
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,280
No.

319
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,280
No matter how many times I ask,

320
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,880
you never answer.

321
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,880
I'm sorry.

322
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,880
No matter how lonely you are,

323
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:12,880
you'll always be there for me.
