1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Imperial Physician

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,560
Your Excellency,

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,360
His Majesty's order

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,320
has arrived.

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,720
Brother has sent you back.

7
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:18,800
How is His Majesty?

8
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,240
The imperial physician said

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,760
he'll be back in two days.

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,600
His Majesty is now

11
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,800
in the palace.

12
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,800
He's kneeling outside to seek an audience.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The Imperial Physician

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
The Imperial Physician

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
The Imperial Physician

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I was ordered to kill the traitors

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
in the south.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I didn't follow the order.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Now that I have the news,

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I hope Your Majesty will approve it.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Chen Zhi,

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I've finally

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
found you.

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The medicine is cold.

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Is this how

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
you serve His Majesty?

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Get out!

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Yes.

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Yes.

31
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Chen Zhi,

32
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I can finally

33
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
leave the position

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
and be promoted.

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You'll be promoted

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
for me.

37
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Imperial Physician

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm the one

39
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
who's been

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
treated by the Heavens

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
and was killed by the Wei State.

42
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,080
I've been

43
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,000
in the maze

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
and regretted

45
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
not being able to bear it.

46
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Your Highness,

47
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
you're a great man.

48
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You've achieved your goal.

49
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Now,

50
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'll be back

51
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
to be the Crown Prince.

52
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The Crown Prince has been

53
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
promoted.

54
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
His main task is

55
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
to be the Crown Prince.

56
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Chen Zhi.

57
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Who is it?

58
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
The doctor.

59
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Your Majesty,

60
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
do you remember

61
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
the imperial palace

62
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
that day?

63
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You are...

64
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Who...

65
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
His Majesty has ordered

66
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
that tomorrow is the day

67
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
of the Imperial Ceremony.

68
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
The remaining days of the previous dynasty

69
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
will be

70
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
canceled tonight.

71
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
The child who was born

72
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
in the back of the palace

73
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
must be somewhere around here.

74
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Hurry up!

75
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Yes.

76
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
He's here.

77
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Hurry up!

78
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
This way!

79
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
But...

80
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
There will be

81
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
a time of danger.

82
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Don't move!

83
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Don't move!

84
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Don't move!

85
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Over there!

86
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Stop him!

87
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Zhuo Shangjie

88
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
has already convinced His Majesty.

89
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Why did he

90
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
use the body of the late Empress?

91
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
His Majesty has ordered

92
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
the death of all the people

93
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
involved in the destruction of the ruins.

94
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You dare to disobey the decree?

95
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Disobey the decree?

96
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Who saw it?

97
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Your Highness.

98
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Young Master.

99
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I don't blame you

100
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
for being the master of the dead.

101
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
But I...

102
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
For the sake of saving your life,

103
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
you let this child go.

104
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Feng Ting.

105
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You...

106
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You...

107
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You...

108
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Who are you?

109
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Back then,

110
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
the one you killed on the dragon's wings

111
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
was my father.

112
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You...

113
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You...

114
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You took the throne

115
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
and made a bad move.

116
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Now the throne is in ruins.

117
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It's really ridiculous.

118
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Please forgive me.

119
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I didn't see anything.

120
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
What do you want me to write?

121
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
What do I write?

122
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You are very loyal.

123
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Now,

124
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
who can rule the country?

125
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Who is worthy of ruling the country?

126
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
The King of the South

127
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
The King of the South

128
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Father.

129
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
The Crown Prince knew he was poor.

130
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
He has left the palace.

131
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Did you get the decree?

132
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Yes.

133
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
The throne is vacant for now.

134
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Father,

135
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
what are you going to do next?

136
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
There have been a lot of movements in the court recently.

137
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Of course, we need to choose a new emperor

138
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
to rule the country.

139
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Send the decree

140
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
and ask all the princes to wait in the hall.

141
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I thought you would make me the emperor.

142
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Shen Zhi,

143
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
as the former emperor,

144
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
you made a rash decision

145
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
and it will cause the court to be in a mess.

146
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I know that.

147
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Everyone knows I am the eunuch.

148
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Of course, I can't be the emperor.

149
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
However,

150
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I will be a little disappointed.

151
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I know you are wronged.

152
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
How about you decide the new emperor yourself?

153
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Is it enough to relieve my son's boredom?

154
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Sounds good.

155
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Wait.

156
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
The trial in the north has ended.

157
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Did you forget to return the tiger tally to the imperial guards?

158
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
His Majesty has returned with an urgent edict.

159
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
There are still some people and animals left in the imperial guards.

160
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I will deal with them

161
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
and return the tiger tally to the imperial guards.

162
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Yes.

163
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You son.

164
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Annoying.

165
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Aunt.

166
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Why are you up?

167
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I just got a little cold.

168
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I can't lie down.

169
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I am worried about this situation.

170
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I will go with you.

171
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Okay.

172
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Didn't you want to greet His Majesty with Prince Zhong?

173
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Why did you come back so early?

174
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Father is seriously ill.

175
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Consort Zhong and I were all stopped outside the door.

176
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
But the situation is a little strange.

177
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I didn't even see a guard on my way back.

178
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
But the palace's main hall is heavily guarded.

179
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
So I suspect...

180
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
What do you suspect?

181
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I suspect that

182
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Father has collapsed.

183
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Your Highness.

184
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Can you tell this to others?

185
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
No.

186
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I am warning you.

187
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You must be careful.

188
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Don't let anyone notice.

189
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
We have been guarding your daughter's identity for almost 20 years.

190
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
We finally have a chance to escape from the palace.

191
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Once we get out,

192
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
we don't have to be afraid anymore.

193
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I will go and get the doctor.

194
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
What are you doing?

195
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Take her away.

196
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Aunt.

197
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Go.

198
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Xiao Wu.

199
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Aunt.

200
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Go.

201
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
In two hours,

202
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
the Yi Ling Army's Star Battalion will arrive at the capital

203
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
and attack the guards on the table.

204
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Minister Zhang.

205
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
The princes will be here in a moment.

206
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Please wait for a moment.

207
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
How long do we have to wait?

208
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Pei Shen Zhi.

209
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Why are you calling us?

210
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
His Majesty is dead.

211
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
The Crown Prince is not capable.

212
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
He has asked his own court to leave the palace.

213
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Nonsense.

214
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Where is my father?

215
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
His Majesty is dead.

216
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
The Crown Prince has left.

217
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
His Majesty's order

218
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
is that the country cannot be destroyed for a day.

219
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I am begging you.

220
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Don't make me do anything.

221
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
You are the crown prince.

222
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
You should do something.

223
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I am asking you,

224
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
what are you doing?

225
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Do something.

226
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I am asking you,

227
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
please.

228
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:58,140
Your Buddhism is not that easy to

229
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,380
Now, His Majesty

230
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,300
is very strict.

231
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,900
His Majesty has been a warrior.

232
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:03,820
So,

233
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:06,780
it's easy to get the jade seal.

234
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,300
Why is it so dirty?

235
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,500
It seems that all princes

236
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:24,740
are very generous.

237
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,460
But the jade seal can't be without a master.

238
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,420
I'm entrusted by His Majesty.

239
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,060
I must obey His Majesty's order.

240
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,460
In that case,

241
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:39,580
let the Third Prince

242
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,900
take the throne.

243
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:44,300
Oh, no.

244
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,940
What... What do you want?

245
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,700
If they hurt Third Brother,

246
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,100
it's only a matter of time

247
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,660
before they kill me.

248
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,660
I want to keep you

249
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,020
and my aunt from the palace.

250
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,260
Fourth Brother,

251
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,260
you must be the best

252
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,540
in martial arts.

253
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,100
But the elder brother is the younger brother.

254
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,060
In theory,

255
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,540
the second brother should be the second brother.

256
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:17,900
Third Brother and I are not on the same side.

257
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,180
It's impossible to take the throne.

258
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,500
How about

259
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,100
you discuss it?

260
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,220
We are brothers.

261
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,460
Don't be mean to each other.

262
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,620
Fifth Brother is right.

263
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,500
Fifth Brother,

264
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,940
I support you to take the throne.

265
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,740
Good brother.

266
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,540
Do you agree or not?

267
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,460
Be careful, Second Brother.

268
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,340
Bring him to me.

269
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:58,940
How dare you stop me

270
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,420
from training martial arts.

271
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,660
My good boy.

272
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:11,140
Let's go.

273
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:14,100
Dear father!

274
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,660
My father!

275
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,780
The school that courted you

276
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,060
has деньd us up.

277
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,500
You are a traitor, Dao伕!

278
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,620
I'll kill all of you.

279
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,220
I'll kill all of you.

280
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,620
I'll kill all of you.

281
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,620
I'll kill all of you.

282
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,620
Kill. Kill. Kill.

283
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,620
Liu Yi is in the Immortal Fragrance.

284
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,620
It seems that the fifth prince

285
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,620
is going to die.

286
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:49,620
I'll kill all of you.

287
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,620
I'll kill all of you.

288
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,620
I'll kill all of you.

289
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,620
Kill. Kill.

290
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,620
Are you crazy?

291
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,620
Crazy?

292
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,620
I've been thinking about the throne for a long time.

293
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,620
They can all be.

294
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,620
Why can't I?

295
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:24,620
You're too naive.

296
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,620
You really think he'll give us the throne?

297
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,620
Minister Pei.

298
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,620
Father entrusted the imperial jade seal to you.

299
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:39,620
If you lose it,

300
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,620
I'll see how you'll explain it to the court.

301
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,620
What do you want?

302
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,620
What do you want?

303
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,620
I don't want the throne.

304
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,620
As long as you let me out of the palace,

305
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,620
and my aunt.

306
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,620
As long as you agree,

307
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,620
we'll never go back to the palace.

308
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,620
What I hate most in this life

309
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:21,620
is the play of life and death in the palace.

310
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,620
How about this?

311
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:27,620
The throne is fine.

312
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,620
You kill me.

313
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,620
I let you go.

314
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,620
Or I kill you

315
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,620
and let him go.

316
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,620
What do you think?

317
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,620
I don't want it.

318
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,620
The King of the Palace

319
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:01,620
The fire in the palace is burning

320
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,620
Love and hate are more than a laugh

321
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:06,620
No one will know the truth here if I kill you.

322
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,620
But I'm willing to let you choose now.

323
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,620
You choose or not.

324
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:15,620
The blood and the oath are gentle

325
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,620
I choose.

326
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,620
The hatred and the sorrow are in my heart

327
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:22,620
Very good.

328
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,620
I don't want it.

329
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:29,620
The thousand troubles are unresolved

330
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,620
I never win

331
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,620
I always say goodbye to you

332
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,620
My sister

333
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:37,620
Don't be sad.

334
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:45,620
The wind and the clouds are breaking through the sky

335
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:49,620
The dream of love is like a mountain and a river

336
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,620
I don't want to look back at the youth

337
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:57,620
I will never stop dreaming

338
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:00,620
Actually, you still have a choice.

339
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,620
You will be the emperor.

340
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:08,620
You and Aunt Li can live.

341
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:12,620
Mr. Pei, why did you choose me?

342
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,620
The fifth prince has lost his power since childhood.

343
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,620
He is not easy to manipulate.

344
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:19,620
You are the most suitable emperor among all princes.

345
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,620
Isn't it?

346
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,620
I promise you

347
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:33,620
Pei Shengzhi welcomes the new emperor to the throne.

348
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,620
I don't want to look back at the youth

349
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,620
I will never stop dreaming

350
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,620
Actually, you still have a choice.

351
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,620
You will be the emperor.

352
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,620
You will be the emperor.

353
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,620
You will be the emperor.

354
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,620
I don't want to look back at the youth

355
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,620
I will never stop dreaming

356
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,620
Actually, you still have a choice.

357
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,620
You will be the emperor.

358
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,620
You will be the emperor.

359
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,620
I don't want to look back at the youth

360
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,620
I will never stop dreaming

361
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,620
Actually, you still have a choice.

362
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,620
You will be the emperor.

363
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,620
You will be the emperor.

364
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,620
You will be the emperor.

365
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,620
I don't want to look back at the youth

366
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,620
I will never stop dreaming

367
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,620
Actually, you still have a choice.

368
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,620
You will be the emperor.

369
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,620
You will be the emperor.

370
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,620
I don't want to look back at the youth

371
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,620
I will never stop dreaming

372
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,620
Actually, you still have a choice.

373
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,620
You will be the emperor.

374
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,620
You will be the emperor.

375
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,620
I don't want to look back at the youth

376
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,620
I will never stop dreaming

377
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,620
Actually, you still have a choice.

378
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,620
You will be the emperor.

379
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,620
You will be the emperor.

380
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,620
I don't want to look back at the youth

381
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,620
I will never stop dreaming

382
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,620
Actually, you still have a choice.

383
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,620
You will be the emperor.

384
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,620
