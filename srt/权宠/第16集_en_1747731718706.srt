1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Imperial Physician

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
How is it?

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Your Excellency,

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
His Majesty's wound is not serious.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
But he is too worried.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
He has been exhausted these days

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and has a fever.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Just give him some medicine

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
to help him calm down.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I see.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You may leave.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Yes.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I know you are awake.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Yes, I am.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
But I don't want to see

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Lord Pei's face.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Does it still hurt?

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I don't want to see Lord Pei's face.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
His Majesty used the refugees to fight against the Hu Ting Army.

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
How can you be sure

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
that they are willing to die?

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Or,

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
how can you be sure

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
that they will succeed?

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
If you have a chance

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
to survive when you are about to starve to death,

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
are you waiting for death

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
or

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
fighting to death?

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Besides,

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
the Hu Ting Army is supposed to protect the palace.

33
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I won't bet on them.

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I dare not kill them.

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Your Majesty,

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I am really touched.

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I won.

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Didn't I?

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Besides,

40
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Lord Pei is here, too.

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It seems that I am not

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
a person who is not willing to give up.

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
But I am curious.

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Aren't you afraid that

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
the money will be taken back?

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
If I want to take it back,

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I have to get all the money

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
and transfer them to the public.

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
But how do you know

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
where the money is?

51
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It is a well-known story.

52
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Since it is related to the people,

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
it is the best way to return it to the people.

54
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Besides,

55
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
these are the money for the refugees' life.

56
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
They will never give up.

57
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
If Lord Zhuo

58
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
orders the Grand Minister to kill the refugees,

59
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I am afraid that the world will be in chaos.

60
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
He knows this.

61
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
But he can't help it.

62
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So he can only be angry with you.

63
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Isn't it?

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
If His Majesty didn't come just now,

65
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
this window is perfectly held.

66
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
But you are soft-hearted.

67
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You almost hit yourself.

68
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The soldiers of the Huting Army are soft-hearted.

69
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I know that

70
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
the people of Daning are kind-hearted.

71
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
If I can use their kindness,

72
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I can also punish them.

73
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Lord Pei said

74
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I was a dog with a heartache.

75
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Your Majesty,

76
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
do you really want to be the emperor?

77
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Lord Pei,

78
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I really regret it.

79
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
But

80
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I have no chance.

81
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Lord Pei has no chance.

82
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
In my heart,

83
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I won't give up.

84
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I have a chance to kill everyone in the state.

85
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,700
so I...

86
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,740
was willing to be with you.

87
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,800
I shouldn't have been so confused.

88
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,400
What do you know?

89
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,000
I could never possibly know.

90
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,400
If you knew the part,

91
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,360
then it was ridiculous to me

92
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,800
not to have a shredding plan in hand.

93
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,820
I just wanted

94
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:40,900
to help you.

95
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:42,840
That was all от me.

96
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,400
Who do you think I am?

97
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,480
What do you think?

98
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You're just

99
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,760
a warm-up person in the Furong Village.

100
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,120
But that's not

101
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,720
what His Majesty said.

102
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Is that so?

103
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,880
Pei Changyin,

104
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,840
you're a little self-righteous.

105
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,600
Do you think

106
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,600
you're nothing

107
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,600
to me?

108
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,600
You're just a person

109
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,600
who would give up on me

110
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,600
when I needed you the most.

111
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,480
I don't need you anymore.

112
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,600
I said

113
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,320
I'd be happy

114
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,720
to be with you.

115
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,120
Don't regret it.

116
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,120
It's late.

117
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,320
You should go back.

118
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,480
I won't see you off.

119
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,480
Your Majesty.

120
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,880
What are you doing here, Lord Pei?

121
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,880
I'm here to apologize.

122
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,880
Before I met you,

123
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,280
I wanted to live with my father

124
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,880
after the late emperor died.

125
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,680
But when I met you,

126
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,680
you're different from everyone

127
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,880
in the Ice Cold City.

128
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,280
You're kind,

129
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,480
smart,

130
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,880
and like a pure jade.

131
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,880
So I took His Majesty's position

132
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,280
and walked forward

133
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,280
step by step.

134
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,680
I don't want to explain it.

135
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,480
Why did I leave you

136
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,680
when His Majesty needed me the most?

137
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,880
Maybe there's a better way

138
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,080
to achieve His Majesty.

139
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,080
But I chose the worst one

140
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,280
and broke His Majesty's heart.

141
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,680
Lord Pei,

142
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,480
you're regretting it.

143
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,480
Yes.

144
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,280
I regret it.

145
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,480
I'm sorry.

146
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,480
It's His Majesty's birthday

147
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,280
in two days.

148
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,480
If His Majesty

149
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,680
gives me a chance,

150
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,880
I'll wait for you in the Liling Court.

151
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,080
I'll think about it.

152
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,880
It's a little cold.

153
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,280
Don't catch a cold.

154
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,880
The world is linear behind us.

155
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,080
Lord Pei,

156
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,320
Sorry for the wait.

157
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,960
This is my birthday gift from my aunt.

158
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,760
I didn't mean to show it to you.

159
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,280
The moon is beautiful tonight.

160
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:49,920
It's beautiful.

161
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,280
I'm a little drunk.

162
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,000
Why don't we enjoy the moon together?

163
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,080
Happy birthday.

164
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,000
Thank you, Mr. Pei.

165
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,240
Thank you for coming

166
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,040
to enjoy the moon tonight.

167
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,000
I have a question.

168
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,480
Mr. Pei said

169
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,120
he was going to kneel down with you.

170
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,360
Why?

171
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,960
It's all because of the past

172
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,600
that I've been thinking about.

173
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,520
If I tell you,

174
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,040
I'm afraid it will disturb

175
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,080
His Majesty's mood for his birthday.

176
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,360
It's okay.

177
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,120
I once

178
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,360
had a real friend.

179
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:37,800
He was the first person

180
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,240
who wanted to be my friend.

181
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,120
His name was Liu Fangtong.

182
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:42,760
Liu...

183
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,040
Tell me.

184
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,240
What did you do?

185
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,800
We agreed not to tell him the secret.

186
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,040
But he told Mr. Zhuo

187
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,640
that I arranged to approach you

188
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,880
to test if you could keep the secret.

189
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,280
But your performance

190
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,840
really disappointed me.

191
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,600
Now that you've killed him,

192
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,320
no one else knows your secret.

193
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,080
Remember.

194
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,920
In this world,

195
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,200
except me,

196
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,600
you can't trust anyone.

197
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,360
Many nights later,

198
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,800
I dreamed of this.

199
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,480
That's how

200
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,960
I became the knife in Mr. Zhuo's hand

201
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,680
and used every means to kill him.

202
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,160
Then you must hate Mr. Zhuo.

203
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,080
But Fangtong didn't want me to hate him.

204
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,360
When he was dying,

205
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,960
he smiled at me.

206
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,400
Don't cry.

207
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,640
I never understood

208
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,760
why he smiled at me at that time.

209
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,800
But I finally understood

210
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,400
why he smiled at me.

211
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,360
Because at that moment,

212
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,560
he was relieved.

213
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,280
He didn't want me to feel guilty

214
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,200
because of his death.

215
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:22,960
So,

216
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,640
it's true that he forced me to approach you.

217
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,200
But it's also true

218
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,920
that he treated me as a friend.

219
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,280
Mr. Pei,

220
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,440
don't let him down.

221
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,120
He doesn't want you to remember your betrayal

222
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,240
and your hatred.

223
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,920
Mr. Pei,

224
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,400
I don't want that either.

225
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,040
Your Majesty,

226
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,040
you're just like him.

227
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,240
You're warm and bright.

228
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,000
Thank you for your praise.

229
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,480
Your Majesty.

230
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,120
Your Majesty asked me

231
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,480
if I had ever liked you.

232
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,880
I not only liked you.

233
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,760
At this moment,

234
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,520
I want to be with you

235
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,080
for the rest of my life.

236
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,480
Your Majesty.

237
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,240
Will you give me another chance?

238
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,760
You haven't told me what your secret is.

239
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,880
I'll tell you now.

240
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,680
The more I know about your mom.

241
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,880
Few things can stay the same.

242
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,440
The STAIR&ENERGY

243
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,760

244
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,920
Faded idea for supervisor of Fшьong.

245
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,800

your mom is díasi's soft drink.

247
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,760
Since she took the Darką

248
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,880
Then my mom exists is more beautiful than you.

249
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,000

00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,200

251
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,560
Sorry, Your Majesty.

252
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:08,000
I will be a name that will last forever.

253
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:18,120
I will be a name that will last forever.
