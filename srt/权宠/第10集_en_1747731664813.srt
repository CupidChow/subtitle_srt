00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Imperial Physician

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The Imperial Physician

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Aunt.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Come and have a look.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I've prepared a birthday gift for His Majesty.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Is it pretty?

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Aunt.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
My birthday is next month.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Isn't it too early to prepare now?

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It's late.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The clothes haven't been embroidered yet.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm worried that I won't be able to finish it by then.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Come.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Turn around and show me.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Come.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Aunt.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Leave the palace.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I've said that no matter what happens,

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'll be with you.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Okay.

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Have you lost weight recently?

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Lord Huo has taken care of it.

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Aunt will leave the palace safely.

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Thank you.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm sorry, Aunt.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I can't let you die with me.

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Are you ready for tomorrow's TV show?

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm confident that

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'll find justice for all the people in the village.

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Lord Huo.

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I know that you've found clues

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
not only about Zhuo Minghua and Zhuo Fuguo.

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Yes.

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
How are you going to deal with it?

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
He's a man of great talent.

39
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
He's a man of high reputation.

40
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
This is a good time to bring him down.

41
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm going to...

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
That's all.

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's not the time to touch Zhuo Fuguo.

44
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Just treat Zhuo Minghua as the one who did it.

45
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Do you understand what I mean?

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Your Majesty.

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Zhuo Fuguo has caused great harm to the people.

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
He deserves to die a hundred times more than Zhuo Minghua.

49
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
He's a man of great talent.

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I understand.

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
But it's not the time.

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Are you afraid?

53
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Huo Zheng.

54
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
How dare you!

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

56
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You may leave.

57
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Brother.

58
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Brother.

59
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Brother.

60
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Huo Zheng doesn't dare to torture me.

61
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Don't worry.

62
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
He didn't ask a word.

63
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
What should I worry about?

64
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I advise you not to behave so weird.

65
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You left such a big scar on him.

66
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You really treat me as the emperor.

67
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It's just a small wound.

68
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I know you're so sincere to me.

69
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Brother.

70
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Please help me get out of here.

71
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Idiot.

72
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Are you too happy to live?

73
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You're so stupid.

74
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm not stupid.

75
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
That's more than 30 lives.

76
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
My mother has been injured by the electric shock.

77
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
She was released from the prison.

78
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
She was tortured.

79
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
She didn't even save her life.

80
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
How could she not even save the minister of the government?

81
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Brother.

82
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Aren't you going to give up on me?

83
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I've done so many dirty things for the Zhuo family for so many years.

84
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I've done so many dirty things for the Zhuo family for so many years.

85
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You're afraid now.

86
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You'd better save your life first.

87
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Don't be stupid on the electric shock.

88
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Don't say anything.

89
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Don't make mistakes.

90
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Remember that.

91
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Thank you, brother.

92
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Okay.

93
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Tell me the details.

94
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Oh, no.

95
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Water.

96
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Come out and save the fire.

97
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Hurry up.

98
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Water.

99
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Mr. Hu.

100
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
The fire came suddenly.

101
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
The bodies in the house are almost burnt.

102
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The electric shock is coming tomorrow.

103
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
What should we do?

104
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
How dare they share the evidence?

105
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Go.

106
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
The criminal, Zhu Minghua,

107
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
killed Zhao Rulan to cover up Luo Fuhai's crimes.

108
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
He killed 36 people in the Junlai Village in the south of the Qin River.

109
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Do you admit your crime?

110
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
There's no need.

111
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
The people of Junlai Village are not convinced that Luo Fuhai is innocent.

112
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
They are all evil and evil.

113
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Besides, these people are all under the law of the Great Ning.

114
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Send Luo Fuhai to the criminal, Li Siqi, the coroner of the Junlai Village.

115
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Luo Fuhai, did you kill Zhao Rulan?

116
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Sir.

117
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Zhao Rulan, the commoner,

118
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
was a famous Yanghua from the eight villages.

119
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I heard from the middleman, Sun Daxiang,

120
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
that he was colluding with me.

121
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
But I gave him a lot of money.

122
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I didn't expect him to be greedy.

123
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
He wanted to trick me.

124
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
If he failed,

125
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
he would be angry.

126
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
He would hit me with a stone.

127
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Sir, please have a look.

128
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Please have a look.

129
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I immediately reported to the authorities from the Junlai Village.

130
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I told Mr. Zhuo that

131
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
he was kind and didn't commit the crime of hurting people.

132
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
But he didn't appreciate it.

133
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
He didn't see the fame being hurt.

134
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
He committed suicide.

135
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Li Siqi, the coroner.

136
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
How did Zhao Rulan die?

137
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Sir,

138
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I checked it.

139
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Zhao Rulan did commit suicide.

140
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
The evidence is clear.

141
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
What else is good?

142
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Send the coroner of the Dali Bureau, Zhou Fangzheng.

143
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Greetings, Your Majesty.

144
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Mr. Zhuo,

145
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
please tell me the result of Zhao Rulan's autopsy.

146
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
According to the official's testimony,

147
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Zhao Rulan's neck was torn by a thorn.

148
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
There is a clear mark.

149
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
He should have been killed by the police.

150
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
He died of suffocation.

151
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
But he didn't commit suicide.

152
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You said Li Siqi was wrong before.

153
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
What evidence do you have?

154
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Luo Fuhai is so rich.

155
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
He doesn't need any woman.

156
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
He doesn't need to kill a woman.

157
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Of course.

158
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Bring him here.

159
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
The evidence is Zhao Rulan's body.

160
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
He was almost burned by a strange fire last night.

161
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
He died in advance.

162
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Did you see it?

163
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Didn't you say the body was burned?

164
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Shut up.

165
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
What else can you say?

166
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I accidentally made a mistake.

167
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Accidentally?

168
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You accidentally

169
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
killed a innocent woman.

170
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Did you pretend to be stupid on purpose?

171
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Or someone instigated you to commit suicide?

172
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Mr. Huo's speculation is unfair.

173
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Please be careful.

174
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Did I instigate you to commit suicide?

175
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
How dare you!

176
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Zhu Minghua,

177
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
what's your identity now?

178
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Did I let you get in?

179
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Mr. Huo,

180
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
even if he was strangled to death,

181
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
he didn't kill him.

182
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
How can I see it?

183
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
How is it not related?

184
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You are the one who killed him.

185
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You are the one who killed him.

186
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
How is it not related?

187
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Send the villagers to send Zhao Di.

188
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Isn't he crazy?

189
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
How can I believe it?

190
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Zhao Di,

191
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
tell us the other day

192
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
how you made up your mind

193
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
for your sister.

194
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
This is the man who sent Zhao Di.

195
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Did you see it

196
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
the night Zhao Ruolan died?

197
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Zhao Di,

198
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
don't be afraid.

199
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm here.

200
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Don't be afraid.

201
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
They dare not do anything.

202
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
A crazy man

203
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
dares to bring a hall.

204
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It's really a trap.

205
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Your Majesty,

206
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
if there is no new evidence,

207
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
you can leave the hall.

208
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Sister Ruolan.

209
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Sister Ruolan

210
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
is a common girl

211
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
who likes medical skills.

212
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
She is gentle,

213
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
not a girl

214
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
who is a woman.

215
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Her heart is very clean.

216
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
But some people's heart is dirty.

217
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
So everything looks dirty.

218
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I know.

219
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Even if she is humiliated,

220
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
she won't kill herself.

221
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
She has died once.

222
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Besides,

223
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
she has made an appointment with Guifen.

224
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
She wants to be with her sisters

225
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
and be with her for the rest of her life.

226
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
She won't leave without saying a word.

227
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
She can't bear to leave.

228
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Sister Zhao Di.

229
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Look at me.

230
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Who am I?

231
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Wu.

232
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I know.

233
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You are for Little Potato.

234
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
For our village chief.

235
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I also know

236
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
you shouldn't believe anyone.

237
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
But please believe me once.

238
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Even if I have to die,

239
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I will do my best

240
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
for all the sisters of Junlai Village.

241
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Luo Feng is the murderer.

242
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
That night,

243
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I was in danger.

244
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Little Potato told me

245
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
something happened.

246
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
It was him.

247
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
He killed Sister Zhao.

248
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Little Potato said

249
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
he saw Sister Zhao being strangled to death

250
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
and then hung on the beam.

251
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I ran over there right away.

252
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I saw Luo Feng

253
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
running away in panic.

254
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
His jade pendant was hung in the yard.

255
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
This is the jade pendant he dropped.

256
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Please give me justice.

257
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Luo Feng.

258
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Someone witnessed you killing Zhao Ruolan

259
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
and left this pendant at the scene.

260
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
How are you going to explain it?

261
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Zhao Di, keep talking.

262
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Luo Feng.

263
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Sister Hui Feng is taking us

264
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
to the deep abyss.

265
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Zhao Di, don't go.

266
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
You have to take care of Little Potato.

267
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
We will help Ruolan

268
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
get justice back.

269
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
This pendant is very important.

270
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Be sure.

271
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Unless you are sure,

272
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
don't take it out.

273
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Go.

274
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Get justice back.

275
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Please give us justice.

276
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Please give us justice.

277
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Please give us justice.

278
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
But then I found out

279
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
that they had betrayed Zhang Li Jun.

280
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I...

281
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I was so scared.

282
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I pretended to be driven crazy.

283
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I was sentenced to life imprisonment

284
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
for the crime of murdering a woman.

285
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I prayed to His Majesty

286
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
for justice

287
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
for the village.

288
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I...

289
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I beg Your Majesty

290
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
to follow the law of Daning

291
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
and sentence Luo Fuhai to death.

292
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
As for Zhuo Junsheng,

293
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
he should be blinded.

294
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
You are right.

295
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I am very grateful.

296
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Your Majesty, what about me?

297
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Please help me.

298
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
The country has its own laws.

299
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Your verdict has nothing to do with me.

300
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
You...

301
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
You are so arrogant.

302
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
When I was bribe,

303
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
you didn't say that.

304
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Who was bribe?

305
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You did.

306
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
You dare to slander the court officer.

307
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Do you have evidence?

308
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Well said.

309
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Do you have evidence?

310
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You are so arrogant.

311
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
You are so arrogant.

312
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
You can slander me.

313
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I will kill you.

314
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Zhuo Minghua.

315
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Zhuo Minghua.

316
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
You are so arrogant.

317
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
You are so arrogant.

318
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
You are so arrogant.

319
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You have been here for 800 times.

320
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
What did I rely on?

321
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
You slandered that woman.

322
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I will kill you.

323
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I slandered who?

324
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Zhulan's mother.

325
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Zhao Ruolan.

326
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Your Majesty.

327
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Your Majesty.

328
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
