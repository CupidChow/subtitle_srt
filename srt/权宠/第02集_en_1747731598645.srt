00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,000
My Lord.

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:16,600
My Lord.

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,480
Why are you still standing?

6
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,080
Tell me about your temper.

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,080
I'll tell you later.

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:23,880
My Lord.

9
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,320
My Lord.

10
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:37,520
My Lord.

11
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,400
Why didn't you kill him?

12
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,880
Your interest in bounding the conditions

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,480
must be held in high regard

14
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:49,840
by the people.

15
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:50,640
Now,

16
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,320
HU Ting Army is divided.

17
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,440
It's a rare opportunity

18
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,720
for you to choose and not be involved.

19
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,160
The Brazil Wing because of you

20
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,760
are ready to go to any kinds of underground committee.

21
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,160
To be honest,

22
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,080
I'm disappointed in your choice.

23
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,040
A Ze,

24
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,040
do you know how many people died in this trial?

25
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,240
1,631 people.

26
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,000
4,368 people.

27
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,440
No one cares about these numbers.

28
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,400
The so-called national army and rebel army

29
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,640
are just the victims' souls

30
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,040
that were killed by the victory.

31
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,880
Since the opening of the country,

32
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,760
we have been killed by many people.

33
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,640
A Ze,

34
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,640
I killed many people.

35
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,920
I blamed my hatred, my ancestors, and my desire.

36
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,840
I killed many people who had nothing to do with me.

37
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,200
I've killed them all.

38
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,440
Can Iierra

39
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,680
stop secondary Fix?

40
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,560
Not be interrupting anyone.

41
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,680
Are you okay?

42
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,480
The action of заб 원

43
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,200
is superfluous.

44
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,960
Tell officials

45
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,120
I really want to know

46
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,480
if you're a flower or a fruit

47
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,800
in the future.

48
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,640
Your Majesty,

49
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,760
the new emperor is arriving at the right time.

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,680
I got it.

51
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,440
Your Majesty,

52
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,960
it's time for the morning court.

53
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,280
I got it.

54
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,360
Your Majesty,

55
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,280
I'm here to serve you.

56
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:15,960
No need.

57
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,320
Yes.

58
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,720
The aunt is still sick.

59
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,800
I don't know if I'm right.

60
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,400
Forget it.

61
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,960
I'm here to serve you.

62
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:25,920
Forget it.

63
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,880
Let's get the morning clothes first.

64
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,480
Chapter 5

65
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,400
The new emperor

66
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,280
is here to serve you.

67
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,820
Theusz H안ing's rule

68
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,080
On this day, I announce his status.

69
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,400
I wish that he will be the king

70
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:34,160
of the discord and destroy

71
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,040
his first law and order,

72
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,480
and build a sincere family,

73
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,160
according to the promise of our country.

74
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,900
I hope that your Majesty

75
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,880
will come back to Zhao'er

76
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,920
and command the army of Jin

77
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,620
to rush to the capital.

78
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,260
I will be the ruler of Tang

79
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,720
and lead all the troops back to Ballian charming.

80
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,360
I, Zhuo Shangxian,

81
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,680
as the main official of the government,

82
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,080
Zhuo Peishengzhi,

83
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,000
as the former eunuch,

84
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,040
will help me with my daily affairs.

85
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,160
That's all.

86
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:10,840
Long live the emperor!

87
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,760
Let's raise our voice.

88
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,640
Zhuo Puguo is loyal and noble.

89
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,040
He has a special power.

90
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,040
He has been the emperor of the state

91
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,600
since he was in the Yutai Prefecture.

92
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,200
This is unreasonable.

93
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,360
This is unreasonable.

94
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,320
Shut up.

95
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,920
This is unreasonable.

96
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,040
This is unreasonable.

97
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,360
This is unreasonable.

98
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,120
This is unreasonable.

99
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,400
This is unreasonable.

100
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,440
This is unreasonable.

101
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,040
Your Majesty,

102
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,480
the officials have not congratulated Zhuo Puguo yet.

103
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,200
Your Majesty,

104
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:58,000
you should greet the emperor with respect.

105
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,240
Congratulations, Zhuo Puguo.

106
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,240
Congratulations, Zhuo Puguo.

107
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,240
Congratulations, Zhuo Puguo.

108
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,240
Congratulations, Zhuo Puguo.

109
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,240
Congratulations, Zhuo Puguo.

110
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,360
I, the imperial censor of the capital,

111
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,160
He Yan,

112
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,160
will not kneel.

113
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,160
Why not?

114
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,160
Why should I kneel to you?

115
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,080
In history, the eunuchs

116
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,160
are against the law and are not allowed to be kind.

117
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,560
You courtiers

118
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,560
are trying to defame the party.

119
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,280
You defame the name of the people.

120
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,160
This is a joke.

121
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,560
I, He Yan,

122
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,560
will not kneel.

123
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,960
Your courage is really admirable.

124
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,560
The duty of my country

125
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,160
is to be conferred by His Majesty.

126
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,360
You not kneeling

127
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,360
is a humiliation to His Majesty.

128
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,160
You are disrespectful.

129
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,160
Aren't you afraid of death?

130
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,760
There is a death in people.

131
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,760
It may be more important than Mount Tai

132
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,560
or lighter than red hair.

133
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,760
If I am killed because I will not kneel,

134
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,760
then I will die in peace

135
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,760
and I will be happy.

136
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,760
If His Majesty is a wise emperor,

137
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,760
he should drive out the courtiers

138
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,760
who are the cause of the chaos

139
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,760
and kill the people.

140
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,760
Your Majesty,

141
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,760
this person is evil.

142
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,760
He is hinting that His Majesty is not a wise emperor.

143
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,760
He should be beheaded

144
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,760
and beheaded immediately.

145
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,760
Yes.

146
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,760
Your Majesty.

147
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,760
Your Majesty.

148
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,760
Your Majesty, please forgive me.

149
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,760
I am a man of the heart

150
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,760
and I will be loyal to His Majesty.

151
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,760
Please forgive me.

152
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,760
You are just a humble man.

153
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,760
It is not your turn to speak here.

154
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,760
Your Majesty.

155
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,760
Please forgive me.

156
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,760
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

157
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,920
Please!

158
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,160
Your Excellency,

159
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,840
please win his favor.

160
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,480
Please help him!

161
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,600
Please help him!

162
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,240
Again, again.

163
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,320
You better hurry and hurry.

164
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,120
What's wrong with you?

165
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:43,960
What happened?

166
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,360
Young Master brought me.

167
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,760
But he started this for me.

168
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,320
He shocked me so,

169
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,760
even I began to be jealous.

170
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:58,400
Do you feel safe?

171
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,460
he committed a fine punishment for jade man.

172
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,560
I'm afraid that

173
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,440
Executive Advocate Fu will be punished,

174
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:08,940
then

175
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,800
when theermup basicallyribrene

176
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,260
and he will become the emperor.

177
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,440
Isn't that a big scare?

178
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,440
Men.

179
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,060
Take He Yanbai away.

180
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,000
Here he is.

181
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,480
He is item Bravo Inspectionist Session of Military بهi.

182
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,080
Official He, from now on,

183
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,760
you can retire.

184
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,240
Thank you, Your Majesty.

185
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,000
Official Fu,

186
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,960
do you think it's a good idea to deal with him like this?

187
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,720
His Majesty has already ordered

188
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,560
why bother asking me?

189
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,440
I bid Your Majesty farewell.

190
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:12,120
Embezzlement and

191
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:21,880
two-time

192
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,480
He Yanbai

193
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,420
The smelly stones in the

194
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,200
well are smelly and hard.

195
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:29,220
I can't keep them.

196
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,140
So annoying.

197
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,920
I think so, too.

198
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,880
Now it's time to meet our little emperor.

199
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,600
Lord Fuguo is here.

200
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,360
Fuguo is here.

201
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,800
Do you have any orders?

202
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,840
You know I want He Yanbai's life.

203
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,960
How dare you defy me?

204
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:00,840
Lord Fuguo.

205
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,920
I'm just saying what I want.

206
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:03,960
Besides,

207
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,480
what's the use of defying you?

208
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,080
Do you think I wouldn't dare to kill you

209
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,640
if you were the emperor?

210
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:29,680
I...

211
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:30,520
I...

212
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,160
I...

213
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,640
Lord Fuguo.

214
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,160
It's still useful to keep it.

215
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,880
Of course I know.

216
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,720
I have to let him know

217
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,920
who is in charge

218
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,080
of this palace.

219
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,760
Lord Fuguo.

220
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,560
I know.

221
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,080
Choose the one you choose

222
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,160
and put him in the corner.

223
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:05,760
Yes.

224
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,380
everybody knows

225
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,360
that if you release your temper first,

226
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,760
they could know you're talking to another.

227
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,080
You're not a petty person.

228
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,120
You're just a fierce beast.

229
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,880
Mr. Pei,

230
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:43,640
are you asking for me

231
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,240
or cutting things off?

232
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,160
You didn't bring my daughter to talk about her and her father.

233
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,640
You shouldn't have saved He Yanbai.

234
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,000
I shouldn't have.

235
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:01,680
But

236
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,160
there are many things in the world

237
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,080
that can't be done through hatred and violence.

238
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,680
Isn't it?

239
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,440
Luckily, I'm just suffering from some skin and flesh pain.

240
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,040
It's worth it.

241
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:17,920
Okay.

242
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,200
If I hadn't saved you just now,

243
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,440
you would have been killed by the Lord of the Fuguo.

244
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,000
I'm sorry.

245
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,280
You are both eunuchs.

246
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,480
You should have a king to control the whole world.

247
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,680
Now only me and Third Brother are left.

248
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,600
If you kill me,

249
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,440
you will be the emperor when you ascend the throne.

250
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:43,600
Even if you

251
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,600
kill me,

252
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,800
I'm afraid

253
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,640
Third Brother won't dare to take the throne.

254
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:51,840
So

255
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,880
you won't kill me now.

256
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,800
Instead of saying that

257
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,520
Lord Pei is pleading for me,

258
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,680
it's better to say that

259
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,720
Lord Pei

260
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
is doing something for Lord Fuguo.

261
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,120
Your Majesty, Aunt Li is awake.

262
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,720
The clock is ticking, I'm jealous of the spring and autumn.

263
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:21,320
Love and hate are like the wind and the moon.

264
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,120
Inevitable.

265
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,880
She turned the doctor'siffany out.

266
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,760
Even being GREENwarded.

267
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,680
Un polar.

268
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,720
Disgrace will come in twos and Friday nights.

269
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:47,840
Perjury

270
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,680
is you, me, or family.

271
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,600
lock you up.

272
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,880
Only look back
