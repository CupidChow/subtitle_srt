Episode 1

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
My Lord,

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
do you want to add ice?

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
My Lord,

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
do you want to add ice?

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
My Lord, do you want to add ice?

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Get out.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Yes.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Lord Pei,

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
then you help me to detoxify.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
What am I thinking?

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It must be a hallucination.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Aunt, are you hungry?

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I made porridge.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Drink some first.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Aunt,

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
how did I come back yesterday?

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
That Gao Guiyun...

20
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I brought you back when I was with your aunt.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So,

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
did you do anything

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
out of the box last night?

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
If I take one step later with Aunt Li,

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm afraid His Majesty will be

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
separated from that Gao Guiyun.

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
There is nothing wrong with his mind.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It must be a hallucination.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Thank you for helping me to detoxify last night.

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Gao Guiyun gave you the medicine.

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
What do you want to do?

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's a gift for you.

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You don't need it.

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Just take it.

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
This medicine can relieve headache.

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'll take it.

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You really don't remember

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
what happened last night?

39
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I don't remember.

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
But last night,

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I had a strange dream.

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I dreamed that my Lord Pei

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
had a hallucination.

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
He did it?

45
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Luckily, it was just a dream.

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Otherwise, I wouldn't know how to face him.

47
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Your Majesty,

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
isn't it?

49
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
What did you say?

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Oh, no.

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Oh, no.

52
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I really did it

53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
against a hallucination.

54
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Your Majesty is here.

55
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Greetings, Your Majesty.

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Do you know your crime?

57
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I deserve to die.

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I shouldn't have drugged Your Majesty's wine.

59
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Although I hurt my body,

60
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I must have made you angry.

61
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'm willing to be punished.

62
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I just beg Your Majesty

63
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
to forgive me for staying with Your Majesty

64
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
and had to do it.

65
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'll be punished.

66
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Had to?

67
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Do you think I don't know

68
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
that you're the spy

69
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
that Lord Fuguo sent to me?

70
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
As a concubine of the harem,

71
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
you don't know which side to stand on.

72
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I can let you live alone in the palace

73
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
and have no one to take care of you.

74
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
There are no treasures to be found.

75
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
There is no firewood to make a living.

76
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
No one will ask you about it in this life.

77
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Do you think Lord Fuguo will care about you?

78
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
He will only send me more nobles

79
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
and never see you as a concubine.

80
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's meaningless.

81
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Your Majesty, I'm sorry.

82
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Please have mercy on me.

83
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'm afraid.

84
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Your Majesty.

85
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Noble Lady Gao,

86
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
now that you know that you're in the palace,

87
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
who is the one who will kill you?

88
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I know that

89
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
your father favors concubines.

90
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Although you're the daughter of the Minister's Manor,

91
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
you're not as beautiful as your family.

92
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So,

93
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
you're the only one who can get a chance

94
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
to get selected by Lord Fuguo.

95
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So,

96
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
you want to get my favor

97
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
and the trust of Lord Fuguo.

98
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Am I right?

99
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
How do you know these?

100
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Bring them in.

101
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Your Majesty,

102
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
these are...

103
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I can give you your title right now.

104
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
From now on,

105
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
you have a wife to serve,

106
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
and a child to teach you.

107
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
In the middle,

108
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I, your husband,

109
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
will only give you money when you need it.

110
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Otherwise, I'll be dead.

111
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I won't bother you.

112
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You should eat and drink.

113
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
If you're bored, go out of the palace

114
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
and clean up your dirty and dirty tricks.

115
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
No one dares to bother you.

116
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
If you're bored and lonely,

117
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
and want to find three or five men to accompany you,

118
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I can satisfy you.

119
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I can't guarantee

120
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
that you can live like this.

121
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
But I can give you

122
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
the perfect life

123
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
that countless women have been waiting for.

124
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Do you want it?

125
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's so tempting.

126
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Your Majesty,

127
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
what do you want me to do?

128
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Eunuch,

129
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Lady Gao's servant, Shaoyao, is asking for you.

130
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Let her in.

131
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Yes.

132
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Greetings, Lady Gao.

133
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Get up and talk.

134
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Yes.

135
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
What's wrong?

136
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Nothing.

137
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I'm fine.

138
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm fine.

139
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'm fine.

140
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Just say it.

141
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Yes.

142
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Lady Gao said

143
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
she should have come to tell you in person.

144
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
But she couldn't make it today.

145
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
She was afraid that you would be anxious.

146
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
So she sent me to tell you.

147
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Lady Gao said...

148
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Lady Gao said His Majesty had a secret weapon

149
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
and he had been torturing her all night.

150
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
The little emperor looks very weak.

151
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
How could he do that?

152
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Since you have succeeded,

153
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
His Majesty sent you a gift today.

154
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
He said he would give you a promotion.

155
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It depends on whether he is angry or not.

156
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Go home.

157
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Yes.

158
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Men

159
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
can't control themselves when they meet women.

160
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Especially beautiful women.

161
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
That's true.

162
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Master

163
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm late.

164
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I know you are wronged.

165
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I won't believe

166
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
you were killed by bandits.

167
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I have been watching the actions of the Shiyi Clan.

168
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Today's case is a good thing.

169
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I will kill Zhuo Gou

170
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
in front of the hall

171
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
to remember the order of Master.

172
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Master's order is in heaven.

173
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Zhuo Gou

174
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
His Majesty has not been in court for half a month.

175
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Why?

176
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I have said

177
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
His Majesty needs to rest.

178
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
If you have the guts,

179
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
you can present it.

180
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I have never

181
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
repeated the words of His Majesty

182
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
in the past half a month.

183
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Today,

184
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I will

185
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
see His Majesty in person.

186
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Huo Zheng

187
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
are you trying to rebel?

188
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I dare not.

189
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It's just that the country is the foundation of the country.

190
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
His Majesty is so wasteful.

191
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
We

192
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
must have an explanation today.

193
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
If His Majesty doesn't see you for a day,

194
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
we will kneel on the court

195
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
and wait for no one.

196
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
His Majesty is already fine.

197
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
If he wants to see,

198
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
let him see.

199
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I will keep an eye on him.

200
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Nothing will go wrong.

201
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Fine.

202
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Since you insist,

203
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
you can even

204
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
take him to see His Majesty.

205
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Yes.

206
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I know that it was the operation of Pei Zhang

207
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
that made me lose two games.

208
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I have the opportunity to take revenge.

209
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
But Pei Zhang

210
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
is trying to lure me with his death.

211
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm afraid he's wrong.

212
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I have no interest in luring Mr. Huo.

213
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I just wish you to be entrusted by someone.

214
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Entrusted by someone?

215
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
By whom?

216
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
In this world,

217
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'm afraid there is only one person

218
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
who can take care of Mr. Huo.

219
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Before going back,

220
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I want to ask Mr. Pei for someone.

221
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Who does His Majesty want?

222
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'll give it to you.

223
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
It's our emperor.

224
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
His Majesty cares about the world.

225
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I believe it.

226
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
But I don't know why Mr. Pei

227
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
promised to help me.

228
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
What are you thinking?

229
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Don't you think

230
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
our emperor

231
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
is still attractive?

232
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Mr. Huo.

233
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Let's go.

234
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Huo Zheng is here.

235
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Your Majesty.

236
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Mr. Huo, please rise.

237
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
You spoke out for the imperial censor Zhang Yi

238
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
in court that day.

239
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Your words are very admirable.

240
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Are you feeling better now?

241
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Thank you for your concern.

242
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I'm fine now.

243
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
But on the way back home,

244
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:18,320
I was

245
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
What?

246
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Can't you say something

247
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
that some people did wrong?

248
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Mr. Pei.

249
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Mr. Huo,

250
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
if there is no evidence,

251
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
don't say it.

252
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Or you'll be in trouble.

253
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Mr. Pei,

254
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
you did it.

255
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Your Majesty,

256
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
do you believe

257
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
such a thing?

258
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
As long as you say no,

259
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I believe it.

260
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Mr. Huo,

261
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
are you here

262
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
to accuse me

263
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
of something?

264
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Is there any hidden reason?

265
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Mr. Pei,

266
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I'll find the evidence sooner or later.

267
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Your Majesty,

268
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I, Huo Zheng,

269
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
have something to report.

270
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Please give me the order

271
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
to kill Zhuo Minghua,

272
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
the son of the Emperor of Jinghua.

273
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Zhuo?

274
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
What's going on?

275
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Zhuo Minghua is the son of the Emperor of Jinghua.

276
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
He covered up the lives of

277
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
the people of Luofu Sea

278
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
and the grass street

279
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
and killed 36 people

280
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
in the Junlai Village

281
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
in the southern part of Qin.

282
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
This is a terrible crime.

283
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Please

284
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
give justice to the people

285
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
who killed their sons.

286
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
What did you say?

287
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Who died?

288
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
The Junlai Village

289
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
in the southern part of Qin.

290
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
The Junlai Village

291
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
in the southern part of Qin

292
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
killed 36 people.

293
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Mr. Huo,

294
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
why did you say that?

295
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
A month ago,

296
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
the Junlai Village in the southern part of Qin

297
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
was attacked by the enemy.

298
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Do you remember that?

299
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I remember.

300
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
There was a former guest

301
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
named Sun Daqiang in the southern part of Qin.

302
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
When the incident happened,

303
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Sun Daqiang was beaten to death.

304
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
He lost his way to make money

305
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
and was sent to the capital

306
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
to teach Luofu Sea,

307
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
to rob Zhao Rulan,

308
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
the daughter of the Ming family.

309
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Zhao Rulan was humiliated

310
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
and died in the Junlai Village.

311
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Later,

312
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Zhang Guifen took the wife of Junlai Village

313
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
to the Junhua County to suppress the deep abyss.

314
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
But Zhuo Minghua

315
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
broke into the gate

316
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
and sentenced all the 36 people

317
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
who came to the abyss to be killed.

318
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Zhuo Minghua is the only local

319
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
who is injured.

320
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
If he can't handle it,

321
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
he may lose his way

322
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
to make money.

323
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Mr. Pei and the suspect Zhuo Minghua

324
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
are relatives.

325
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
They should be killed.

326
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
You can't decide

327
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
whether to kill or not.

328
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Your Majesty.

329
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I will report to Zhuo Fubo

330
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
and investigate it thoroughly.

331
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Investigate it thoroughly?

332
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Who knows what you are thinking?

333
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Even if I have any idea,

334
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
how can you blame me?

335
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
You...

336
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Shut up.

337
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I will go to the Junlai Village

338
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
to investigate this case.

339
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Mr. Pei,

340
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
you won't stop me, will you?

341
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
The love and hate are like the wind and the moon.

342
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
They are not good.

343
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
The blood and the tears are gentle.

344
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
The hatred and hatred are like the heart.

345
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
They are not good.

346
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
It's done.

347
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Viola

348
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Light

349
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
If I could be her

350
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I would tear on her in one fell swoops.

351
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Azizes

352
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Everyone must beat her.

353
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,700
For goodness sake,

354
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
tell me who is сложат favorite.

355
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Geez.
