The Taoism Grandmaster

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,300
Lord Pei,

4
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:19,900
would you spare my life?

5
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:23,100
I've changed my mind.

6
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,700
I can keep your secret as a woman for you.

7
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:27,800
Besides,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,200
a woman has no right to be a king.

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,000
A woman?

10
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,600
The world is big.

11
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,200
Who says a woman can't be a king?

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,400
A king is only up to the king and the queen.

13
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,200
It depends on which path

14
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,200
you want to choose.

15
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:52,700
The Taoism Grandmaster

16
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,100
Before I go back,

17
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,100
I want to ask you for a favor.

18
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,300
I can give you the person you want.

19
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,100
Thank you, Lord Pei.

20
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,500
I'm here to help you.

21
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,900
Even if you have another purpose,

22
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,900
I still want to thank you

23
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,400
for saving my life and my aunt's.

24
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,800
You also gave me a path

25
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,600
that I could choose.

26
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,400
I want to try

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
this path.

28
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:35,800
Let's go.

29
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,900
The Taoism Grandmaster

30
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,900
Walking around is harmful to the state.

31
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,100
Come up. I'll carry you.

32
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,100
No need.

33
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,700
I can walk on my own.

34
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,100
Just sit there.

35
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,500
It's so ugly.

36
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:10,900
The Taoism Grandmaster

37
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,100
Lord Pei, you're walking in front of me.

38
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,100
Aren't you afraid that I'll stab you in the back?

39
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,700
Your Majesty is too high-minded.

40
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,300
With your skills,

41
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,700
you can't even beat me with one hand.

42
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,300
Lord Pei,

43
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:25,900
where's our horse?

44
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:26,500
There's no horse.

45
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,500
Aren't you in a hurry to go back to the capital?

46
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:41,700
The Taoism Grandmaster

47
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:43,900
Tell me.

48
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,100
Lord Pei,

49
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,300
I was scared by the quake in the palace a few days ago.

50
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,300
I wanted to run out of the palace to relax.

51
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:52,900
I admit defeat.

52
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,300
Just go out of the palace to relax?

53
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,300
Yes.

54
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,400
The Taoism Grandmaster

55
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,200
You're a bastard.

56
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,000
They went out of the palace without your permission.

57
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,800
You even deceived them.

58
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,000
You made them feel so proud in Qin Nan County.

59
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,000
It's just a coincidence.

60
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,400
If you really don't want to vent your anger,

61
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,000
just kill him.

62
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,400
Lord Pei, please spare me.

63
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,400
I won't do it again.

64
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,100
I sent His Majesty out of the palace.

65
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,900
If you want to punish me,

66
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,300
then punish me.

67
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,100
Raise your head and reply.

68
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,300
Your Highness,

69
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:37,900
a few days ago,

70
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,100
I saw His Majesty in the palace.

71
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,900
I thought of a way to take him out of the palace to relax.

72
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,300
Why is there a shadow of him in the eyes?

73
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,300
It's all my fault.

74
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,700
Please don't blame His Majesty.

75
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,700
You're really bold.

76
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,900
I forced him to do it.

77
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:00,900
Please spare me.

78
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,300
What a deep love story.

79
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,900
Do you really think I won't kill you?

80
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,500
Kill him.

81
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,300
Let me be the emperor.

82
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:20,700
What do you think?

83
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,500
You're so silly.

84
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,300
You're really afraid that the world will be in chaos.

85
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:32,700
Forget it.

86
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,500
In the face of the truth,

87
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,500
I won't investigate what happened today.

88
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,300
But His Majesty is ridiculous and must be punished.

89
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,300
From today on,

90
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,500
no one is allowed to enter or leave the palace for five days.

91
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,300
Mr. Pei.

92
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,500
Mr. Pei, you're hurt.

93
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,300
Mr. Pei.

94
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:56,000
hmm

95
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,700
Those people.

96
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,900
They are either happiness-absent or married.

97
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,500
You can scoring off material wealth.

98
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,700
Everyone supports each other.

99
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,200
When they share a robin,

100
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:23,900
they will all be brought misunderstood.

101
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,740
I can't even keep the land of the potatoes.

102
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:27,900
I'll fight with you.

103
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:31,260
But we still have to live our lives.

104
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,380
You're right.

105
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,100
Who is it?

106
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,260
It's me.

107
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:52,740
Come in.

108
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:54,420
Yes.

109
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:12,820
Mr. Pei,

110
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,660
you look different today.

111
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:21,380
Eat.

112
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,020
No one knows.

113
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:24,620
Okay.

114
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:36,500
Eat slowly.

115
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,700
Don't eat too fast.

116
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:54,580
Here.

117
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,620
I put some painkillers in the water.

118
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,220
I got them from the hospital.

119
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,220
It will help you recover.

120
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:17,940
You don't want me to help you

121
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,340
because you don't want to soak it yourself?

122
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,700
Thank you, Mr. Pei.

123
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,980
I just don't want you to feel weak.

124
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,380
It will be a loss for the country.

125
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,380
Thank you.

126
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,140
Mr. Pei,

127
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,420
I have a question for you.

128
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:12,980
Go ahead.

129
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,140
Due to the rules of the care system,

130
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:18,100
the land can only be inherited by Nan Ding.

131
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,740
It will cause the sisters of Junlai Village

132
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,780
to be in a state of irreconcilable.

133
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,340
In your opinion,

134
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:23,660
can a woman

135
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,700
have her own land?

136
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,260
Your Majesty,

137
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,780
you want to announce the new government?

138
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:36,620
Yes.

139
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,260
It's not difficult to announce the new government.

140
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:41,620
What's difficult

141
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,980
is to change the prejudice of the people.

142
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,420
Prejudice

143
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,020
The reasons for prejudice

144
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,940
is because they don't have a chance to know

145
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:57,940
and they are unwilling to know.

146
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,740
People talk about Pei Changyin

147
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,820
as the√ Anyone is evil.

148
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,260
But the Pei Changyin in my heart

149
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,620
is a gentle and cowardly girl.

150
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,660
He is kind under pressure.

151
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,260
He appears cold

152
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,140
but drives awayرة hot feet.

153
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,740
You don't understand.

154
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,500
I'm sorry.

155
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,340
Your Majesty,

156
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,860
don't listen to others.

157
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,460
I'm the emperor of the puppet

158
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,460
with no foundation.

159
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,340
Mr. Pei is willing to

160
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,780
take care of me and my aunt.

161
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,660
I'm his loyal servant.

162
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,140
To me,

163
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,220
Mr. Pei is not someone else.

164
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,420
He's someone I can trust.

165
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,580
I'm sorry.

166
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:58,740
Your Majesty,

167
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,380
do you want to drag me down?

168
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,180
Yes.

169
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,100
I'm serious.

170
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:06,620
Then we'll have to see

171
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,660
how sincere you are.

172
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,220
What sincerity

173
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,420
do you want, Mr. Pei?

174
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,240
What I want

175
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:22,680
is too special.

176
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,840
Your Majesty,

177
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,000
have an early rest.

178
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,680
ーHow can the river of silent autumn että

179
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,040
make the whole land

180
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,640
full of its flowers?

181
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,420
I'm here.

182
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,300
Father,

183
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,860
you should not touch the right side of the temple.

184
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,020
This scene

185
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,500
reminds me of

186
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,940
a eunuch a long time ago.

187
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,980
He also likes to play with these flowers and grass.

188
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,740
We Yan people

189
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,780
have damaged hair and skin.

190
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,780
There is a smell of

191
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,620
unbearable face on our body.

192
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,140
He planted these flowers and grass

193
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,140
to cover up some of the meaning of confusion.

194
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:38,980
In a blink of an eye,

195
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:44,180
he has been dead for seven or eight years.

196
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,180
Why did you mention him suddenly?

197
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:51,460
Father,

198
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:56,180
do you still hate me for killing him?

199
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,660
Of course I hate you, Father.

200
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,700
I hate you for being cruel.

201
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,060
The first person I kill

202
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,500
is my best friend.

203
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:20,780
But

204
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,180
I'm on the same boat with you.

205
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:27,580
What's the point of hating me?

206
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,860
I just want to stand by you

207
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,700
and keep the boat from sinking.

208
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,460
I'm relieved

209
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,420
that you can think so.

210
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,580
After all, you have been out of the battle for two years.

211
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:48,140
I'm worried about you.

212
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,620
Our father and son

213
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,380
have separated from each other.

214
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:57,660
How come?

215
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,380
Father's teaching

216
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,940
is never forgotten.

217
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,940
That's great.

218
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:10,660
By the way,

219
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,740
that little emperor is very annoying.

220
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,620
The situation is different now.

221
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,540
You have to keep an eye on him.

222
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,260
Yes.

223
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:36,100
Aunt Li.

224
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:39,860
Mr. Pei.

225
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,580
Is there anything wrong with you?

226
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,820
The late emperor's plan was to seal the seal

227
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,740
and make the female camp a male camp.

228
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,580
Except for you,

229
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,060
who else knows about this?

230
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,180
I'm the only one left.

231
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,580
How kind you are to me

232
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,220
that you are willing to

233
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,220
take the blame of deceiving the emperor.

234
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,540
I'm just a maid.

235
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,540
I have to listen to you.

236
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,980
There are rules in the palace.

237
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,380
There must be a record.

238
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:24,140
Although the late emperor was not on the throne,

239
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,260
he was already in the palace.

240
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,620
He doesn't know.

241
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,700
Don't you know the official who was on the throne?

242
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,460
Maybe at that time,

243
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,620
I was so crazy

244
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,140
that no one dared to come close.

245
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,260
I heard his nonsense

246
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:43,300
and went to give orders.

247
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,220
Really?

248
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,380
It seems that only I can find

249
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,620
the official who was on the throne.

250
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,580
Sir, don't.

251
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:51,900
Sir.

252
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,180
Sir, this is

253
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,100
a suspicion

254
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,940
that will bring the emperor a disaster.

255
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,100
Since you chose to keep a secret,

256
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:07,900
please

257
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,700
don't let the emperor fall into danger.

258
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:14,780
Aunt Li.

259
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:15,420
Aunt.

260
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,460
I'm here.

261
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,980
I only believe you once.

262
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,060
If you dare to lie to me,

263
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,180
I will kill you.

264
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:32,020
The light of the candle light the wine of the spring.

265
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:36,620
Love and hate are like the wind and the moon.

266
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,220
They are not shy.

267
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:42,740
They are not shy.

268
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,060
Unlike a great people,

269
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,100
outsider's incumbent verydisplaystyle language

270
00:16:51,580 --> 00:17:10,780
is this person with

271
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:44,220
The Long Ballad

272
