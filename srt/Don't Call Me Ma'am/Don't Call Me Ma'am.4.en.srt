4
00:00:31,335 --> 00:00:33,904
- Congratulations, Cho Na Jeong.
- Congrats.

5
00:00:36,573 --> 00:00:39,076
See? I told you she'd pull it off.

6
00:00:39,076 --> 00:00:41,511
I can't believe you beat 100-to-1 odds.

7
00:00:41,511 --> 00:00:42,346
Is that even possible?

8
00:00:42,346 --> 00:00:43,347
I told you so.

9
00:00:43,347 --> 00:00:45,849
She was never meant to rot away at home.

10
00:00:45,849 --> 00:00:47,117
Thanks, guys.

11
00:00:47,117 --> 00:00:50,687
So everything is on me tonight.

12
00:00:50,687 --> 00:00:52,055
Eat all you want.

13
00:01:02,065 --> 00:01:03,233
This is good.

14
00:01:03,533 --> 00:01:05,402
- Thanks, girl.
- Yeah.

15
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:08,238
But when's Sang Gyu coming?

16
00:01:08,572 --> 00:01:10,540
No idea.
We can just have fun without him.

17
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:11,875
He's the one who begged to join anyway.

18
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:13,110
How's he been?

19
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,379
I think I heard he was in Busan.

20
00:01:15,379 --> 00:01:16,380
So, how was he?

21
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,681
Did he glow up or fall apart?

22
00:01:18,248 --> 00:01:20,484
He's pretty much the same.

23
00:01:20,817 --> 00:01:21,919
Seriously?

24
00:01:21,919 --> 00:01:24,154
So he's still that scruffy artist type?

25
00:01:24,154 --> 00:01:27,324
When I think of Sang Gyu,
all I see is that seaweed hair.

26
00:01:27,324 --> 00:01:30,227
He probably thought
it looked cool like this.

27
00:01:30,227 --> 00:01:31,561
Flicking it like this.

28
00:01:32,596 --> 00:01:33,463
Hey.

29
00:01:33,764 --> 00:01:35,565
I know I looked ridiculous.

30
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:37,734
Sang Gyu.

31
00:01:37,734 --> 00:01:39,836
A glow-up.

32
00:01:41,371 --> 00:01:42,673
Hop on.

33
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,241
No.

34
00:01:44,241 --> 00:01:46,677
- Not this back, the other one.
- The other one.

35
00:01:46,977 --> 00:01:48,745
I need a different back.

36
00:01:49,146 --> 00:01:52,082
Lee Il Ri, stop acting up,
and let's go home.

37
00:01:52,082 --> 00:01:54,084
Come on, get on my back.

38
00:01:54,084 --> 00:01:55,319
Hop on so we can leave.

39
00:01:57,054 --> 00:01:58,455
I said no.

40
00:02:01,191 --> 00:02:02,392
Can you even carry her?

41
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,795
Hey, we're heading out first.

42
00:02:04,795 --> 00:02:06,530
- Get home safe.
- See you.

43
00:02:07,064 --> 00:02:09,266
Honestly, every time she drank,

44
00:02:09,266 --> 00:02:11,335
she refused to get on everyone's back...

45
00:02:11,335 --> 00:02:13,604
except Sang Gyu's.

46
00:02:13,904 --> 00:02:14,938
Why were you like that?

47
00:02:15,205 --> 00:02:16,039
What are you talking about?

48
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:18,775
I was drunk! I just rode on anyone's back.

49
00:02:18,775 --> 00:02:20,344
Hey, what did you just say?

50
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:22,813
You said no to everyone else
but looked for me.

51
00:02:22,813 --> 00:02:23,714
- Yeah.
- Right.

52
00:02:23,981 --> 00:02:25,582
I don't remember that.

53
00:02:27,251 --> 00:02:28,352
Here you go again.

54
00:02:51,608 --> 00:02:52,509
Hey.

55
00:02:52,509 --> 00:02:54,278
I think Sang Gyu's into you.

56
00:02:55,112 --> 00:02:55,913
No way.

57
00:02:55,913 --> 00:02:57,414
Seriously.

58
00:02:57,414 --> 00:02:58,815
He only had eyes for you.

59
00:02:58,815 --> 00:03:00,150
Hey, got for it with him.

60
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,619
Yes, and the timing is perfect too.

61
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,489
But I like handsome guys.

62
00:03:06,023 --> 00:03:08,725
What? He's actually good-looking.

63
00:03:08,725 --> 00:03:09,760
Yeah.

64
00:03:11,862 --> 00:03:13,363
Naraeng and Joobari, your taxis are here.

65
00:03:13,363 --> 00:03:14,298
Thanks.

66
00:03:14,598 --> 00:03:15,432
Good luck.

67
00:03:16,967 --> 00:03:19,069
- Let's go.
- Okay. See you.

68
00:03:19,503 --> 00:03:20,804
See you, Joobari.

69
00:03:28,178 --> 00:03:29,012
Get home safe.

70
00:03:47,064 --> 00:03:47,965
What?

71
00:03:48,432 --> 00:03:50,867
I thought he was plain,
but he's kind of cute.

72
00:03:52,002 --> 00:03:54,071
Actually, not bad at all.

73
00:03:58,242 --> 00:03:59,109
By the way,

74
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,878
how'd you go from a business major...

75
00:04:02,346 --> 00:04:03,880
to a manual therapist?

76
00:04:05,482 --> 00:04:06,850
When I was a kid,

77
00:04:07,184 --> 00:04:08,919
my parents were always out working,

78
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:10,053
so my grandma raised me.

79
00:04:10,454 --> 00:04:12,089
Then, when I was 29 or so,

80
00:04:12,589 --> 00:04:14,524
she got into a bad accident...

81
00:04:15,158 --> 00:04:16,393
and couldn't walk again.

82
00:04:16,393 --> 00:04:18,528
So I quit acting...

83
00:04:18,528 --> 00:04:20,664
and went down to Busan to care for her.

84
00:04:20,664 --> 00:04:24,334
I tried learning everything I could
to help her walk again,

85
00:04:24,334 --> 00:04:26,169
and somehow, I ended up here.

86
00:04:28,038 --> 00:04:29,973
Is your neck okay now?

87
00:04:31,408 --> 00:04:32,509
Yes.

88
00:04:33,043 --> 00:04:34,444
Dude, you've got magic hands.

89
00:04:34,978 --> 00:04:37,214
It feels so much better
thanks to your therapy.

90
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,049
Thanks, dude.

91
00:04:39,783 --> 00:04:40,784
Good, I'm glad.

92
00:04:42,819 --> 00:04:44,655
You're not that young anymore.

93
00:04:44,655 --> 00:04:47,291
So don't go drinking
and passing out anywhere.

94
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:48,392
You'll ruin your health.

95
00:04:49,026 --> 00:04:51,194
Excuse me? When did I ever?

96
00:04:51,194 --> 00:04:53,497
That was when I was young.
I don't do that anymore.

97
00:04:59,136 --> 00:05:00,203
She reeks of alcohol.

98
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:17,321
You can go now. We're here.

99
00:05:17,854 --> 00:05:18,689
Go where?

100
00:05:18,989 --> 00:05:19,923
Why?

101
00:05:20,257 --> 00:05:22,192
You don't want to say goodbye yet?

102
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,460
What are you talking about?

103
00:05:24,127 --> 00:05:26,363
You want another drink with me?

104
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,432
This isn't our last day.

105
00:05:28,899 --> 00:05:29,833
What are you saying?

106
00:05:30,901 --> 00:05:33,070
Hey, my place is right...

107
00:05:38,108 --> 00:05:39,676
Wait. You live here?

108
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:41,245
No way, you too?

109
00:05:46,617 --> 00:05:49,086
What are the odds?

110
00:05:49,086 --> 00:05:50,821
You mean you live right across from me?

111
00:05:50,821 --> 00:05:52,489
How's that even possible?

112
00:05:54,891 --> 00:05:58,362
Well, these days, neighbors barely
even say hi anymore.

113
00:05:59,463 --> 00:06:01,298
Still, that's good for you.

114
00:06:02,366 --> 00:06:03,500
What do you mean?

115
00:06:03,767 --> 00:06:06,536
Now you don't have to worry about creeps.

116
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:09,239
If some guy ever follows you,
call me right away.

117
00:06:09,239 --> 00:06:10,407
Got it?

118
00:06:10,407 --> 00:06:12,309
What the heck. He's confusing me.

119
00:06:13,277 --> 00:06:14,278
Is he flirting with me or what?

120
00:06:15,345 --> 00:06:16,613
Unbelievable.

121
00:06:21,118 --> 00:06:21,885
Bye, then.

122
00:06:22,586 --> 00:06:23,553
Good night.

123
00:06:24,121 --> 00:06:25,489
Yeah, you too.

124
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,562
Il Ri, later, if you...

125
00:06:40,437 --> 00:06:41,605
What's this?

126
00:06:41,605 --> 00:06:43,206
Why are you in my home without permission?

127
00:06:43,206 --> 00:06:45,776
If you're going to pack my stuff,
at least do it properly.

128
00:06:47,044 --> 00:06:49,146
You didn't give me my tablet,
so I couldn't even work.

129
00:06:49,146 --> 00:06:51,048
You could've just texted me.

130
00:06:51,048 --> 00:06:53,617
Why come to my house without permission?

131
00:06:53,617 --> 00:06:55,252
I did, but you didn't even reply.

132
00:06:56,053 --> 00:06:57,821
I'm swamped as it is.

133
00:06:58,956 --> 00:06:59,790
But who's that?

134
00:07:03,794 --> 00:07:05,362
Why do you care?

135
00:07:15,405 --> 00:07:16,840
- This...
- I'm sorry, dude.

136
00:07:17,574 --> 00:07:19,643
That's someone I used to date.

137
00:07:19,943 --> 00:07:21,845
He got so clingy it was disgusting,

138
00:07:21,845 --> 00:07:23,280
- so I dumped him.
- I see.

139
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,515
But I forgot to change the door code,

140
00:07:26,383 --> 00:07:28,285
and he came in like a stalker.

141
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:30,787
I was so scared
so I pretended you were my boyfriend.

142
00:07:30,787 --> 00:07:31,688
I'm sorry.

143
00:07:31,688 --> 00:07:33,156
No.

144
00:07:33,624 --> 00:07:34,891
You did the right thing.

145
00:07:35,692 --> 00:07:36,893
How creepy.

146
00:07:37,594 --> 00:07:39,930
He was being so persistent,

147
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:42,332
so I kept ignoring his calls.

148
00:07:42,332 --> 00:07:44,067
And now he just shows up like that.

149
00:07:48,972 --> 00:07:49,840
Anyway,

150
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:53,043
I'm so glad...

151
00:07:54,177 --> 00:07:55,712
you live right across.

152
00:07:57,514 --> 00:07:59,283
I told you.

153
00:07:59,283 --> 00:08:01,318
You don't have to worry about creeps.

154
00:08:06,924 --> 00:08:08,392
- Is he gone?
- Is he gone? Let's see.

155
00:08:11,128 --> 00:08:12,262
- He's gone.
- He's gone.

156
00:08:13,664 --> 00:08:14,831
Yes, he's gone.

157
00:08:15,165 --> 00:08:16,500
Thank goodness.

158
00:08:23,106 --> 00:08:24,308
Well...

159
00:08:25,842 --> 00:08:27,044
I'll get going then.

160
00:08:27,044 --> 00:08:28,345
- Yes.
- Okay.

161
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:30,881
Yeah, I'm off.

162
00:08:37,254 --> 00:08:38,922
But Il Ri,

163
00:08:38,922 --> 00:08:41,792
shouldn't you change your door code now?

164
00:08:42,859 --> 00:08:44,494
What if I'm gone...

165
00:08:44,494 --> 00:08:45,929
and he just shows up again?

166
00:08:46,296 --> 00:08:47,764
Yeah, good point.

167
00:08:48,732 --> 00:08:49,800
Should I, then?

168
00:08:50,567 --> 00:08:52,169
Yeah, go ahead and change it.

169
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,875
All done.

170
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:03,947
I can't believe I'm showing you
this mess after 20 years.

171
00:09:05,449 --> 00:09:06,717
Hey, what are you talking about?

172
00:09:06,717 --> 00:09:07,951
Back in college,

173
00:09:07,951 --> 00:09:09,620
I carried your drunk self all the time.

174
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,788
I've already seen
all kinds of things from you.

175
00:09:15,792 --> 00:09:16,660
Anyway,

176
00:09:17,361 --> 00:09:18,495
you can go first.

177
00:09:19,263 --> 00:09:20,264
You go first.

178
00:09:21,365 --> 00:09:22,199
Okay.

179
00:09:22,599 --> 00:09:23,500
Bye, then.

180
00:09:27,504 --> 00:09:28,772
Hey.

181
00:09:29,139 --> 00:09:31,108
If anything ever happens,

182
00:09:31,108 --> 00:09:32,476
call me right away, okay?

183
00:09:33,176 --> 00:09:34,011
I'm right there.

184
00:09:34,478 --> 00:09:35,312
Okay.

185
00:09:43,854 --> 00:09:44,821
Hello.

186
00:09:52,429 --> 00:09:56,300
(Sweet Home Shopping)

187
00:10:04,474 --> 00:10:05,375
Mi Sook.

188
00:10:07,444 --> 00:10:09,146
You got in too?

189
00:10:09,146 --> 00:10:10,247
Congrats.

190
00:10:10,247 --> 00:10:11,815
What? You got in too?

191
00:10:12,449 --> 00:10:13,183
Yeah.

192
00:10:20,624 --> 00:10:21,592
Hello.

193
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:25,028
I'm Team Leader Kim Tae Jeong,

194
00:10:25,028 --> 00:10:28,031
and I'll be overseeing
your internship program.

195
00:10:28,031 --> 00:10:29,967
During the three-month course,

196
00:10:29,967 --> 00:10:31,735
you'll be paired with a mentor...

197
00:10:31,735 --> 00:10:33,570
and receive one-on-one guidance.

198
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:36,974
In the process,
you'll gain hands-on experience...

199
00:10:36,974 --> 00:10:38,075
with practical tasks
like marketing meetings,

200
00:10:38,075 --> 00:10:40,744
partner meetings,
and live broadcast observations.

201
00:10:41,511 --> 00:10:43,113
Any questions so far?

202
00:10:44,448 --> 00:10:45,582
If not, we'll continue.

203
00:10:48,719 --> 00:10:51,088
I was so nervous
I didn't sleep a wink last night.

204
00:10:51,088 --> 00:10:52,389
I'm dead tired.

205
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,691
I wonder who my mentor will be.

206
00:10:55,158 --> 00:10:57,261
I heard that in this industry,

207
00:10:57,261 --> 00:10:59,329
a bad mentor can be worse
than a mean senior nurse.

208
00:11:00,464 --> 00:11:02,699
Still, we've only done
live commerce before,

209
00:11:02,699 --> 00:11:04,268
so we really need help from a higher-up.

210
00:11:04,268 --> 00:11:06,236
We've got to make
the most of this opportunity.

211
00:11:08,739 --> 00:11:10,240
You've done live commerce?

212
00:11:10,474 --> 00:11:12,209
That's awesome.

213
00:11:12,209 --> 00:11:14,745
I tried to get into live commerce too,

214
00:11:14,745 --> 00:11:15,746
but got rejected everywhere.

215
00:11:15,746 --> 00:11:18,715
Can I ask what kind of stream you did?

216
00:11:18,715 --> 00:11:20,751
My gosh, Ms. Cho.
Hello!

217
00:11:20,751 --> 00:11:22,552
Min Joo, Seon Young.

218
00:11:22,552 --> 00:11:23,654
How have you been?

219
00:11:23,654 --> 00:11:25,822
We heard you were coming back.

220
00:11:26,456 --> 00:11:28,158
How does it feel to be back?

221
00:11:28,158 --> 00:11:31,161
It's not really a comeback.
I'm just an intern.

222
00:11:31,161 --> 00:11:33,864
Come on, Ms. Cho.
You're basically guaranteed a spot.

223
00:11:34,765 --> 00:11:36,900
You're not like those
who've never done a main broadcast.

224
00:11:41,538 --> 00:11:45,175
I'm practically starting all over again.

225
00:11:46,176 --> 00:11:47,978
Anyway, enjoy your meal.

226
00:11:47,978 --> 00:11:49,546
Thanks. Bye.

227
00:11:56,987 --> 00:11:58,088
Actually...

228
00:11:58,088 --> 00:11:59,022
What was that?

229
00:11:59,456 --> 00:12:01,091
That felt kind of condescending.

230
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:04,895
Do they think
we're all nobodies or something?

231
00:12:05,495 --> 00:12:07,531
No, that's not what they meant.

232
00:12:08,465 --> 00:12:09,232
Forget it.

233
00:12:09,232 --> 00:12:11,468
You'd better keep this in mind.

234
00:12:11,668 --> 00:12:14,371
If you get special treatment
just because you used to work here,

235
00:12:14,972 --> 00:12:17,040
I'm not letting that slide.

236
00:12:31,021 --> 00:12:32,923
First day and it's already intense.

237
00:12:33,156 --> 00:12:34,291
How scary.

238
00:12:35,259 --> 00:12:36,893
Executive Director.

239
00:12:37,461 --> 00:12:40,964
I really don't want Cho Na Jeong
as my mentee.

240
00:12:42,165 --> 00:12:44,101
I really can't stand her.

241
00:12:44,901 --> 00:12:47,404
We didn't get along back then either
and ended up having a huge fight.

242
00:12:47,404 --> 00:12:49,339
You know that, Executive Director.

243
00:12:50,574 --> 00:12:53,143
You don't get to pick your mentee here.

244
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,845
You take what you're given.

245
00:12:55,245 --> 00:12:56,513
Fine.

246
00:12:56,513 --> 00:12:59,349
Can I handle her however I want, then?

247
00:13:04,254 --> 00:13:05,155
Do what you want.

248
00:13:12,629 --> 00:13:14,798
If she acts all high and mighty,

249
00:13:14,798 --> 00:13:16,833
I'm going to drop her.

250
00:13:41,158 --> 00:13:41,959
What?

251
00:13:42,993 --> 00:13:44,394
Damn it.

252
00:14:02,713 --> 00:14:04,014
What happened?

253
00:14:04,014 --> 00:14:05,282
How'd it go?

254
00:14:05,282 --> 00:14:07,050
Did you and Sang Gyu
take things to the next level?

255
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:07,851
Hey.

256
00:14:08,085 --> 00:14:09,419
I think I'm pregnant.

257
00:14:09,753 --> 00:14:10,654
Already?

258
00:14:10,654 --> 00:14:12,155
No.

259
00:14:12,155 --> 00:14:13,590
Not with Sang Gyu.

260
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:14,891
What do you mean?

261
00:14:15,092 --> 00:14:18,528
I've been so out of it lately
that I didn't really pay attention,

262
00:14:18,862 --> 00:14:21,198
but I realized I haven't had my period
in three months.

263
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:24,067
Around that time, I thought it was safe,
so we skipped condoms a few times.

264
00:14:24,835 --> 00:14:27,070
Are you a teenager or what?

265
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:29,273
What should I do?

266
00:14:29,273 --> 00:14:31,174
He's already checked out.

267
00:14:31,775 --> 00:14:32,843
What about the test?

268
00:14:32,843 --> 00:14:33,977
Right, the test.

269
00:15:01,038 --> 00:15:01,972
What does it say?

270
00:15:02,706 --> 00:15:03,840
Tell me.

271
00:15:05,309 --> 00:15:06,276
One line.

272
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:10,180
See? You scared me for nothing.

273
00:15:10,781 --> 00:15:12,249
Then why don't I have my period...

274
00:15:12,516 --> 00:15:13,450
for three whole months?

275
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:15,352
Maybe your cycle's off.

276
00:15:15,352 --> 00:15:16,954
Just go get checked.

277
00:15:16,954 --> 00:15:18,822
And go to sleep, okay?

278
00:15:28,265 --> 00:15:29,633
Premature menopause?

279
00:15:29,967 --> 00:15:32,569
Have your periods gotten lighter...

280
00:15:32,569 --> 00:15:35,839
or irregular lately?
Have you been feeling more irritable...

281
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,908
or having trouble
controlling your emotions?

282
00:15:38,275 --> 00:15:39,176
Well,

283
00:15:40,177 --> 00:15:41,945
maybe a bit.

284
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:45,282
Your blood test results aren't great.

285
00:15:45,816 --> 00:15:49,286
See here, your AMH level is
practically zero.

286
00:15:50,287 --> 00:15:53,357
That means you've got
almost no viable follicles left...

287
00:15:53,357 --> 00:15:55,359
for ovulation.

288
00:15:55,359 --> 00:15:57,327
Is there any way to delay it?

289
00:15:58,762 --> 00:16:01,598
Not at this point, no.

290
00:16:16,647 --> 00:16:17,648
It's okay.

291
00:16:18,148 --> 00:16:21,051
It's not like I ever planned
on having kids anyway.

292
00:16:21,818 --> 00:16:24,054
Actually, not having periods
is kind of nice.

293
00:16:24,588 --> 00:16:26,223
You know how bad my cramps were.

294
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:28,625
When they hit near a deadline,

295
00:16:30,027 --> 00:16:31,061
it was pure hell.

296
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:35,699
Cheer up. I'm really fine.

297
00:16:56,753 --> 00:16:58,388
What did you want to say?

298
00:17:03,427 --> 00:17:06,229
Say it now. I go live soon.

299
00:17:06,229 --> 00:17:07,097
Okay.

300
00:17:08,398 --> 00:17:09,333
Ye Na.

301
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,568
You might not want to do this.

302
00:17:11,568 --> 00:17:13,403
But I'll really work hard,

303
00:17:13,403 --> 00:17:14,571
so please help me out.

304
00:17:15,005 --> 00:17:17,407
I know this must be uncomfortable for you.

305
00:17:18,342 --> 00:17:21,278
We hurt each other's feelings back then,

306
00:17:22,012 --> 00:17:24,414
so having me here as an intern
cannot be easy.

307
00:17:25,682 --> 00:17:29,119
But after six years away,

308
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:32,155
I've forgotten everything
and feel completely lost.

309
00:17:34,057 --> 00:17:35,892
Just think of it as mentoring a junior,

310
00:17:36,193 --> 00:17:37,694
and guide me a little, will you?

311
00:17:44,401 --> 00:17:45,702
Shoot, what do we do?

312
00:17:46,303 --> 00:17:47,905
They said the demo model can't come.

313
00:17:47,905 --> 00:17:48,672
What?

314
00:17:49,106 --> 00:17:49,940
Why not?

315
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,808
She got into a minor car accident,

316
00:17:51,808 --> 00:17:52,976
and it'll take about two hours
to sort it out.

317
00:17:54,845 --> 00:17:57,314
We're almost on air.
What are we supposed to do?

318
00:17:57,714 --> 00:17:59,049
Any backup model?

319
00:17:59,049 --> 00:18:00,550
Wasn't the last show a beauty segment?

320
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:02,619
Yeah, but they already clocked out
and left the area.

321
00:18:03,287 --> 00:18:04,288
So without a demo,

322
00:18:04,288 --> 00:18:06,089
you expect me to handle
everything by myself?

323
00:18:07,324 --> 00:18:08,258
How about...

324
00:18:08,725 --> 00:18:11,061
I try doing that?

325
00:18:11,061 --> 00:18:12,329
It's been a while,

326
00:18:12,329 --> 00:18:14,231
but I think I can manage
a simple demonstration.

327
00:18:21,371 --> 00:18:22,272
Would you really?

328
00:18:22,472 --> 00:18:25,242
Which product was it again exactly?

329
00:18:26,376 --> 00:18:27,177
Hair.

330
00:18:27,544 --> 00:18:28,612
A hair product. Okay.

331
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,315
Then...

332
00:18:31,315 --> 00:18:33,450
I'll prep a before look and jump right in.

333
00:19:02,145 --> 00:19:03,013
What exactly...

334
00:19:03,714 --> 00:19:04,915
did you just do?

335
00:19:07,718 --> 00:19:08,785
Earlier,

336
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:11,321
didn't you say it was a hair product?

337
00:19:11,321 --> 00:19:12,956
Me? When did I say that?

338
00:19:14,324 --> 00:19:15,325
Producer Kim.

339
00:19:15,792 --> 00:19:17,694
Did I say it was a hair product?

340
00:19:17,694 --> 00:19:18,762
What?

341
00:19:18,762 --> 00:19:20,264
Well...

342
00:19:20,264 --> 00:19:21,164
No.

343
00:19:22,266 --> 00:19:24,167
See? I can't even.

344
00:19:25,469 --> 00:19:28,105
You misheard it and now you're blaming us?

345
00:19:28,605 --> 00:19:29,506
Just...

346
00:19:30,274 --> 00:19:32,476
admit it was your mistake.

347
00:19:34,244 --> 00:19:36,513
I'll take care of this,
so just step aside.

Ms. Lee Il Ri, who turned 80 this year,

352
00:20:28,231 --> 00:20:31,535
once again survives
on rice soaked in water for her meals.

Having never married,

she has no family.

The only time
she gets to talk to anyone...

356
00:20:41,044 --> 00:20:42,346
is once a month,

357
00:20:42,346 --> 00:20:44,648
when the social worker visits.

358

00:21:21,418 --> 00:21:22,319
Gosh.

370
00:21:24,421 --> 00:21:26,423
What's wrong? Are you okay?

371
00:21:27,658 --> 00:21:28,492
It's nothing.

372
00:21:29,326 --> 00:21:31,995
Get back to work.

373
00:21:32,496 --> 00:21:33,864
Goodness, you scared me.

374
00:21:33,864 --> 00:21:34,831
My heart is pounding.

375
00:21:35,465 --> 00:21:36,633
What's going on?

376
00:21:50,547 --> 00:21:52,783
Il Ri, are you all right?

377
00:21:53,183 --> 00:21:55,852
(Seon Art Center)

378
00:22:03,627 --> 00:22:06,730
(Mother-in-law)

379
00:22:07,731 --> 00:22:08,732
Yes, Mother.

380
00:22:11,201 --> 00:22:12,936
I didn't make you come
when you're busy, did I?

381
00:22:13,837 --> 00:22:14,838
Not at all.

382
00:22:15,138 --> 00:22:17,374
I was just about to head home anyway.

383
00:22:17,374 --> 00:22:20,110
It's so nice
to have dinner with you, Mother.

384
00:22:20,677 --> 00:22:21,645
Thank you for saying that.

385
00:22:21,645 --> 00:22:23,413
I was shopping nearby...

386
00:22:23,413 --> 00:22:26,316
and thought I'd call to see your face.

387
00:22:26,316 --> 00:22:29,019
It seems you're not working
overtime today.

388
00:22:29,019 --> 00:22:29,987
Right. These days,

389
00:22:29,987 --> 00:22:32,022
I try not to work late if I can help it.

390
00:22:32,556 --> 00:22:34,157
Good.

391
00:22:34,157 --> 00:22:35,826
That's how it should be.

392
00:22:35,826 --> 00:22:37,461
You're not strong to begin with,

393
00:22:37,461 --> 00:22:40,097
so I was always worried
you'd wear yourself out.

394
00:22:40,097 --> 00:22:42,065
Late nights and dieting.

395
00:22:42,065 --> 00:22:44,668
Those are the roots
of all illness for women.

396
00:22:45,335 --> 00:22:48,705
Eat up, okay?

397
00:22:48,705 --> 00:22:49,473
Yes.

398
00:22:52,109 --> 00:22:54,945
Is everything all right
with your marriage lately?

399
00:22:56,847 --> 00:22:57,915
Well, yes.

400
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:01,952
I was walking around
the department store today...

401
00:23:02,286 --> 00:23:05,255
and found something
that suits you perfectly.

402
00:23:06,556 --> 00:23:08,191
Thank you, Mother.

403
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:09,860
What is it?

404
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:10,794
Open it.

405
00:23:11,061 --> 00:23:11,895
Come on.

406
00:23:23,307 --> 00:23:25,275
What do you think? Pretty, right?

407
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:27,311
Yes.

408
00:23:27,678 --> 00:23:31,081
A woman, above all,
needs to keep her stomach warm.

409
00:23:31,381 --> 00:23:32,516
Last time I saw you,

410
00:23:32,516 --> 00:23:35,052
you were wearing panties
barely the size of your palm.

411
00:23:35,052 --> 00:23:37,220
That won't do.

412
00:23:45,162 --> 00:23:47,397
I took care of the broadcast.

413
00:23:48,065 --> 00:23:50,834
As for you,
organize a list of the recent products...

414
00:23:50,834 --> 00:23:52,502
and make sure you're familiar with them.

415
00:23:53,036 --> 00:23:54,271
Sort them by category,

416
00:23:54,271 --> 00:23:56,640
and send it to me before you leave.

417
00:23:56,907 --> 00:23:58,275
But earlier you definitely told me...

418
00:23:58,275 --> 00:23:59,409
Is that really what matters right now?

419
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:01,612
Was almost causing a disaster
not enough for you?

420
00:24:04,481 --> 00:24:05,282
Seriously?

421
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:16,093
Tonight, there's a team dinner
with the executive director...

422
00:24:16,093 --> 00:24:18,295
and the other team.
Make sure you attend.

423
00:24:18,495 --> 00:24:19,329
A team dinner?

424
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:22,266
Why? You can't come again?

425
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,202
No.

426
00:24:32,142 --> 00:24:33,543
What are you saying?

427
00:24:33,844 --> 00:24:35,379
Suddenly,
there's no one to watch the kids?

428
00:24:35,379 --> 00:24:37,014
I asked our nanny,

429
00:24:37,014 --> 00:24:39,449
but her son-in-law and daughter
are visiting, so she can't.

430
00:24:39,449 --> 00:24:40,717
Honey.

431
00:24:40,717 --> 00:24:42,986
Can't we just ask your mom to take them?

432
00:24:42,986 --> 00:24:45,088
How can Mom handle three kids alone?

433
00:24:45,088 --> 00:24:47,424
But I can't cancel the meeting.

434
00:24:47,424 --> 00:24:48,892
Anyway, I can't today.

435
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,929
I have to go. Sorry.

436
00:24:52,963 --> 00:24:54,831
Honey, you can't just leave.

437
00:24:54,831 --> 00:24:55,732
Honey...

438
00:25:03,907 --> 00:25:04,741
Hey.

439
00:25:05,409 --> 00:25:06,376
Hi, Mom.

440
00:25:06,677 --> 00:25:07,644
What is it?

441
00:25:07,644 --> 00:25:10,414
Tae Rin got hand, foot, and mouth disease
and couldn't go to kindergarten.

442
00:25:11,181 --> 00:25:13,083
Your sister-in-law made such a fuss.

443
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:15,319
I'm worn out.

444
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:17,254
I see.

445
00:25:17,254 --> 00:25:19,189
How's work?

446
00:25:19,189 --> 00:25:20,524
It's fine.

447
00:25:22,993 --> 00:25:25,262
Your sister-in-law's calling again.

448
00:25:25,262 --> 00:25:26,063
I'll hang up.

449
00:25:26,063 --> 00:25:27,664
Okay, Mom. I'll call you back.

450
00:25:35,072 --> 00:25:36,006
(Min Woo's Mom, Na Jeong)

451
00:25:36,773 --> 00:25:37,841
Yes, Na Jeong?

452
00:25:38,041 --> 00:25:39,009
Jin Hee.

453
00:25:41,511 --> 00:25:42,379
I have...

454
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,148
a favor to ask.

455
00:25:45,716 --> 00:25:46,516
Ask.

456
00:25:48,919 --> 00:25:52,389
I said it was okay.
You really didn't have to bother.

457
00:25:52,389 --> 00:25:54,258
I could've just taken the bus.

458
00:25:54,258 --> 00:25:55,259
Not at all.

459
00:25:55,259 --> 00:25:57,694
How could you carry
all this heavy stuff alone, Mother?

460
00:25:59,596 --> 00:26:01,131
Would you like to come in for a bit?

461
00:26:01,131 --> 00:26:03,567
No, that's okay.
I should go before Sang Min gets home.

462
00:26:03,567 --> 00:26:05,302
Wait a minute.

463
00:26:05,302 --> 00:26:08,505
I've got something special for you.

464
00:26:08,505 --> 00:26:09,873
Hold on.

465
00:26:31,361 --> 00:26:33,030
Joo Young.

466
00:26:37,467 --> 00:26:38,902
Here.

467
00:26:40,671 --> 00:26:42,539
I visited a monk I know,

468
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:44,508
and he wrote this for you.

469
00:26:44,942 --> 00:26:47,110
He said your energy seemed really low.

470
00:26:47,844 --> 00:26:49,680
I've been feeling so down lately.

471
00:26:51,281 --> 00:26:53,984
Sometimes I wonder what you did
in a past life to end up without children.

472
00:26:54,785 --> 00:26:57,588
Just thinking about it
makes my chest ache at night.

473
00:27:01,825 --> 00:27:03,260
You're not offended, are you?

474
00:27:03,594 --> 00:27:05,262
No, Mother. Of course not.

475
00:27:05,963 --> 00:27:06,797
Good.

476
00:27:07,197 --> 00:27:09,132
When I go to stay in Jeju for a month,

477
00:27:09,132 --> 00:27:11,635
could you remind Sang Min
to water my plants?

478
00:27:12,235 --> 00:27:13,203
Yes.

479
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:15,672
Thanks.
I'm not walking you all the way out.

480
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:17,274
Bye.

481
00:27:17,274 --> 00:27:18,609
I'll get going.

482
00:27:39,129 --> 00:27:42,132
(Oh Sang *)

483
00:27:54,978 --> 00:27:55,846
Seriously?

484
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,015
Why is it that she never once thinks...

485
00:27:58,015 --> 00:28:00,484
any of this might be her son's fault?

486
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,821
Because he's afraid I'll tell him off,

487
00:28:04,821 --> 00:28:06,590
he got his things delivered
to his parents' house?

488
00:28:07,357 --> 00:28:09,159
What did he buy this time?

489
00:28:31,848 --> 00:28:33,884
- Bye.
- Bye.

490
00:28:50,567 --> 00:28:51,902
How much longer do I have to wait?

491
00:28:51,902 --> 00:28:53,437
I'm not quite finished yet.

492
00:28:53,437 --> 00:28:54,938
Could you wait just a bit longer?

493
00:28:58,775 --> 00:29:00,177
All right then.

494
00:29:00,177 --> 00:29:02,646
Finish it up and email it to me.

495
00:29:02,946 --> 00:29:03,814
Sure.

496
00:29:13,724 --> 00:29:14,825
By the way,

497
00:29:15,259 --> 00:29:16,593
aren't you hungry?

498
00:29:17,261 --> 00:29:18,161
Well...

499
00:29:18,161 --> 00:29:21,265
Since the team dinner's
at a Korean BBQ place,

500
00:29:21,465 --> 00:29:23,367
it'd be a shame to spoil your appetite.

501
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,335
See you in a bit.

502
00:29:44,521 --> 00:29:46,957
Hey, why do you keep using my cup?

503
00:29:46,957 --> 00:29:49,326
The red one's mine.

504
00:29:51,094 --> 00:29:52,429
Ms. Hwang.

505
00:29:52,429 --> 00:29:53,430
Yes?

506
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:56,934
She keeps telling me
not to touch anything.

507
00:29:57,367 --> 00:29:58,802
Yu Ah Young.

508
00:29:58,802 --> 00:30:00,337
That's not nice.

509
00:30:00,337 --> 00:30:02,839
He's a guest.
Let him borrow your cup.

510
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:06,376
Why are you always taking his side
instead of mine, Mom?

511
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:08,045
I hate you, Mom.

512
00:30:10,013 --> 00:30:13,650
Why is my princess upset again?

513
00:30:13,951 --> 00:30:15,485
You'll listen to Mommy, right?

514
00:30:15,485 --> 00:30:16,587
Okay.

515
00:30:17,387 --> 00:30:18,488
Good girl.

516
00:30:21,692 --> 00:30:22,659
Hey.

517
00:30:23,894 --> 00:30:25,429
Let's eat.

518
00:30:26,863 --> 00:30:27,931
When are they going home?

519
00:30:30,601 --> 00:30:32,669
Their mom's busy today.

520
00:30:37,241 --> 00:30:38,141
What?

521
00:30:38,575 --> 00:30:40,544
Did you forget I'm in exam week, Mom?

522
00:30:40,777 --> 00:30:42,179
How could you say
you'd take care of all those kids...

523
00:30:44,648 --> 00:30:45,616
for her?

524
00:30:46,984 --> 00:30:49,186
That's enough. Eat your dinner.

525
00:30:50,487 --> 00:30:51,855
I'm not eating with them.

526
00:30:52,956 --> 00:30:54,157
Bring mine to my room.

527
00:30:56,293 --> 00:30:57,995
Yu Bo Hyeon.

528
00:30:59,529 --> 00:31:01,465
We're so grateful.

529
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:07,971
Sorry.

530
00:31:07,971 --> 00:31:09,439
- You're here.
- Yes.

531
00:31:09,439 --> 00:31:10,507
- Sit.
- Yes.

532
00:31:11,174 --> 00:31:12,009
Mr. Kim.

533
00:31:12,342 --> 00:31:14,444
This young lady here.

534
00:31:15,612 --> 00:31:16,780
She used to be...

535
00:31:17,214 --> 00:31:20,584
a promising talent I had high hopes for.

536
00:31:21,718 --> 00:31:22,953
But then she had kids,

537
00:31:23,487 --> 00:31:25,689
and totally let me down.

538
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:28,592
- Hey, Cho Na Jeong.
- Yes, ma'am.

539
00:31:28,592 --> 00:31:30,027
You know,

540
00:31:30,027 --> 00:31:31,962
as a fellow working mom,

541
00:31:32,195 --> 00:31:35,299
I really wanted you to do well.

542
00:31:35,299 --> 00:31:36,767
That's why I was harder on you.

543
00:31:38,468 --> 00:31:39,303
But then,

544
00:31:39,803 --> 00:31:41,572
this one here...

545
00:31:41,572 --> 00:31:43,740
couldn't handle it and quit.

546
00:31:45,409 --> 00:31:46,877
Did you quit because of me?

547
00:31:46,877 --> 00:31:48,478
No, Executive Director.

548
00:31:48,478 --> 00:31:49,446
Then why did you quit?

549
00:31:50,013 --> 00:31:52,316
I'm sorry. I lacked persistence.

550
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:54,818
You'll do better this time, right?

551
00:31:55,018 --> 00:31:56,486
Yes, I'll do my best.

552
00:31:59,723 --> 00:32:01,058
Good. Okay.

553
00:32:01,925 --> 00:32:04,595
Then let's go celebrate and get fired up.

554
00:32:04,861 --> 00:32:07,698
Mr. Kim, does karaoke sound good?

555
00:32:08,565 --> 00:32:10,200
Of course.

556
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,769
Let's go.

557
00:32:14,004 --> 00:32:15,172
Let's go.

558
00:32:26,416 --> 00:32:28,352
As expected of Mr. Kim.

559
00:32:31,922 --> 00:32:35,559
<i>Yesterday</i>

560
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:39,162
<i>Today</i>

561
00:32:39,162 --> 00:32:41,498
<i>And tomorrow</i>

562
00:32:41,498 --> 00:32:45,402
<i>I just want to keep hearing those words</i>

563
00:32:46,403 --> 00:32:49,106
<i>You like me</i>

564
00:32:49,106 --> 00:32:50,073
<i>Like me</i>

565
00:32:50,073 --> 00:32:52,676
<i>I like you</i>

566
00:32:52,676 --> 00:32:53,744
<i>Like you</i>

567
00:32:53,744 --> 00:32:56,346
<i>You like me</i>

568
00:32:56,346 --> 00:32:57,314
<i>Like me</i>

569
00:32:57,314 --> 00:33:00,484
<i>I like you</i>

570
00:33:09,793 --> 00:33:12,529
Everyone.

571
00:33:13,063 --> 00:33:14,564
At this point,

572
00:33:14,898 --> 00:33:17,935
let's have Na Jeong sing one.

573
00:33:17,935 --> 00:33:19,436
Give her a hand.

574
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:26,109
<i>Now it's time to smile again</i>

575
00:33:26,743 --> 00:33:30,213
<i>This is a happy moment, happy days</i>

576
00:33:30,213 --> 00:33:32,382
<i>Straighten your shoulders</i>

577
00:33:32,382 --> 00:33:35,852
<i>Erase all the hardships</i>

578
00:33:35,852 --> 00:33:37,120
<i>In the world</i>

579
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,591
<i>Forget your sorrow, never cry</i>

580
00:33:40,591 --> 00:33:44,027
<i>Under the blazing sun, sunny days</i>

581
00:33:44,027 --> 00:33:48,131
<i>May only good things fill your life</i>

582
00:33:48,131 --> 00:33:50,200
<i>That's all you need to wish for</i>

583
00:34:00,377 --> 00:34:02,145
Hype Na Jeong.

584
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,848
I've got high hopes for you.

585
00:34:06,316 --> 00:34:07,985
Since it took so much
for you to come back,

586
00:34:08,485 --> 00:34:10,554
you'll have to work twice,
even three times harder than others.

587
00:34:12,189 --> 00:34:13,390
Okay, let's head back.

588
00:34:13,390 --> 00:34:14,191
Executive Director.

589
00:34:14,191 --> 00:34:16,093
Yeah, what is it?

590
00:34:24,368 --> 00:34:25,302
You have to go?

591
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:28,405
I'm sorry.

592
00:34:28,405 --> 00:34:30,207
My schedule got a bit mixed up,
so I should.

593
00:34:40,651 --> 00:34:41,551
You're leaving already?

594
00:34:43,887 --> 00:34:44,821
Yeah.

595
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:49,893
Then go ahead.

596
00:34:50,827 --> 00:34:54,731
If she can't even stay
until the end of a team dinner,

597
00:34:54,731 --> 00:34:55,799
why did she bother coming back to work?

598
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:19,022
Why do I have to be sent
to the study room?

599
00:35:19,022 --> 00:35:21,325
If I blow this exam,
are you going to take responsibility?

600
00:35:22,092 --> 00:35:24,261
Why are you so touchy?

601
00:35:24,261 --> 00:35:27,097
If my friend's busy, I can watch her kids.

602
00:35:27,497 --> 00:35:29,866
Your daughter's in exam season,
and your friend comes first?

603
00:35:30,367 --> 00:35:32,970
If she has to dump her kids at someone
else's place, then she shouldn't work.

604
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:34,504
She's so selfish.

605
00:35:37,307 --> 00:35:39,109
Do you think you can just say
whatever you want?

606
00:35:44,748 --> 00:35:45,949
Bo Hyeon.

607
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:01,398
I'm sorry, Na Jeong.

608
00:36:02,899 --> 00:36:05,435
Bo Hyeon's going through
puberty these days,

609
00:36:05,435 --> 00:36:07,004
and she argues about everything.

610
00:36:08,071 --> 00:36:08,906
No.

611
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:11,308
I'm the one who should apologize.

612
00:36:12,743 --> 00:36:13,911
I was being clueless.

613
00:36:14,311 --> 00:36:16,179
I didn't even know
it was exam week for Bo Hyeon.

614
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,515
Hey, don't worry about it.

615
00:36:18,949 --> 00:36:20,784
She doesn't study anyway,

616
00:36:20,784 --> 00:36:23,086
and she just found the perfect excuse,
that's all.

617
00:36:28,692 --> 00:36:30,627
You haven't even had dinner yet?

618
00:36:31,628 --> 00:36:32,663
I have.

619
00:36:33,497 --> 00:36:35,032
Hey, eat before you go.

620
00:36:35,032 --> 00:36:36,500
No, Jin Hee. I'm not hungry.

621
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:39,436
I made too much curry.
If it's left, I'll have to throw it out.

622
00:36:39,436 --> 00:36:41,271
Consider this
helping me not to waste food.

623
00:36:58,755 --> 00:37:00,424
It must be tough for you.

624
00:37:10,701 --> 00:37:13,604
Did you buy a new dish?

625
00:37:14,471 --> 00:37:15,639
I haven't seen this before.

626
00:37:25,849 --> 00:37:26,817
Na Jeong.

627
00:37:37,761 --> 00:37:38,962
Still, Na Jeong,

628
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:41,932
hang in there as long as you can.

629
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,303
If you hold out a bit longer
and the kids get older,

630
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:49,706
you'll be glad you stuck it out
when you look back.

631
00:37:51,575 --> 00:37:54,912
You know, when I had Bo Hyeon
and quit my job,

632
00:37:55,612 --> 00:37:58,215
it was really hard.

633
00:37:59,249 --> 00:38:01,685
But do you know what the hardest part was?

634
00:38:05,222 --> 00:38:07,658
Feeling pushed out of society.

635
00:38:09,393 --> 00:38:11,528
That was what I couldn't stand.

636
00:38:18,802 --> 00:38:21,905
But you grabbed the opportunity
before it was too late.

637
00:38:23,373 --> 00:38:25,642
It's such a precious opportunity.

638
00:38:25,842 --> 00:38:26,777
So hold on.

639
00:38:27,177 --> 00:38:29,012
Hold on as long as you can.

640
00:38:29,446 --> 00:38:33,850
I didn't begrudgingly watch
Min Woo and Min Jun, you know.

641
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:37,454
In a way, you're living out my dream.

642
00:38:37,454 --> 00:38:38,322
Okay?

643
00:38:38,322 --> 00:38:41,792
So how could I not root for you?

644
00:38:43,694 --> 00:38:45,262
And the Cho Na Jeong I know...

645
00:38:45,729 --> 00:38:48,732
isn't someone who crumbles
just because of something like this.

646
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,435
Chin up, Cho Na Jeong.

647
00:38:56,139 --> 00:38:57,674
Eat up.

648
00:38:57,674 --> 00:38:59,543
It won't taste good once it's cold.

649
00:39:03,614 --> 00:39:04,748
Come on, eat up.

650
00:39:09,019 --> 00:39:10,053
Thanks, Jin Hee.

00:40:22,526 --> 00:40:23,393
Ye Na.

656
00:40:25,028 --> 00:40:26,496
Did you get home okay last night?

657
00:40:26,496 --> 00:40:27,631
It ran really late, didn't it?

658
00:40:28,332 --> 00:40:29,499
Did you prep for the meeting?

659
00:40:29,499 --> 00:40:31,368
Of course. Let's go.

660
00:40:34,738 --> 00:40:35,606
Here.

661
00:40:38,942 --> 00:40:40,377
What's this?

662
00:40:40,377 --> 00:40:42,346
You got me a latte? That's fattening.

663
00:40:43,547 --> 00:40:46,850
Haven't you noticed
I only drink regular coffee?

664
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:48,018
Sorry.

665
00:40:48,585 --> 00:40:51,421
You haven't been eating much lately,

666
00:40:51,421 --> 00:40:53,190
so I was worried your stomach would hurt.
I'll bring you another drink.

667
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:54,157
It's fine.

668
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:58,328
Have you thought of any ideas?

669
00:40:59,196 --> 00:41:01,465
You must've gotten
a lot of input while at home.

670
00:41:02,099 --> 00:41:03,967
While I was home,

671
00:41:03,967 --> 00:41:06,003
there was a product I looked into.

672
00:41:06,003 --> 00:41:07,504
An automatic stationary bike.

673
00:41:07,771 --> 00:41:10,040
You just rest your feet on the pedals...

674
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,241
and it moves on its own.

675
00:41:11,241 --> 00:41:13,277
Who would buy that?

676
00:41:13,877 --> 00:41:16,079
If you use an automatic bike,

677
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:17,547
how is that a workout?

678
00:41:17,547 --> 00:41:19,316
Hear me out first.

679
00:41:19,316 --> 00:41:21,885
My mom had knee surgery a few years ago,

680
00:41:21,885 --> 00:41:24,288
and did rehab for a while.

681
00:41:24,288 --> 00:41:27,491
For seniors with low strength,
it's really useful.

682
00:41:27,491 --> 00:41:30,661
Our home shopping's main customers
are older adults.

683
00:41:30,661 --> 00:41:31,561
I think...

684
00:41:31,561 --> 00:41:32,863
this is not impressive.

685
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:36,667
The Executive Director said
we should lower our target age.

686
00:41:37,367 --> 00:41:40,370
We'd be better off with luxury bags,
sunglasses, and things like that.

687
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:42,706
No, sunglasses are a no-go.

688
00:41:43,974 --> 00:41:44,908
Why?

689
00:41:44,908 --> 00:41:46,643
No matter how nice they are,

690
00:41:46,643 --> 00:41:49,680
you can't tell if they suit you
without trying them on.

691
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,982
If returns pour in, that's just risk.

692
00:41:52,816 --> 00:41:54,318
That's your view, Na Jeong.

693
00:41:54,318 --> 00:41:56,119
That's not the trend these days.

694
00:41:56,587 --> 00:41:58,922
You don't have any useful ideas.

695
00:42:10,233 --> 00:42:11,168
All right.

696
00:42:11,902 --> 00:42:14,071
Let's wrap up the monthly meeting here.

697
00:42:15,105 --> 00:42:16,440
And now,

698
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:19,376
let me hear items you think
would be good...

699
00:42:19,376 --> 00:42:20,377
to launch on our channel.

700
00:42:23,046 --> 00:42:24,348
Speak up, everyone.

701
00:42:26,283 --> 00:42:28,118
On first-mover products,

702
00:42:28,118 --> 00:42:30,454
reports say we're far behind
our competitors.

703
00:42:30,988 --> 00:42:33,590
We all need to take ownership
and work together to survive.

704
00:42:36,593 --> 00:42:37,561
Executive Director.

705
00:42:37,794 --> 00:42:40,163
May my mentee present something?

706
00:42:41,198 --> 00:42:42,065
Who's your mentee?

707
00:42:42,466 --> 00:42:43,233
Me.

708
00:42:45,535 --> 00:42:47,437
I'm Yang Mi Sook.

709
00:42:48,939 --> 00:42:49,873
Go ahead.

710
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:52,276
I may not know much else,

711
00:42:52,276 --> 00:42:55,712
but I'm pretty savvy with luxury,
so here's my take.

712
00:42:55,979 --> 00:42:57,648
This season,

713
00:42:57,648 --> 00:42:59,716
Hercules released a new sunglasses model.

714
00:43:00,117 --> 00:43:01,385
- Put it up.
- Yes.

715
00:43:03,186 --> 00:43:04,087
Nice.

716
00:43:04,955 --> 00:43:06,490
Really sleek, right?

717
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:10,060
It sold out completely
as soon as it dropped.

718
00:43:10,827 --> 00:43:13,196
Before another home shopping channel
gets exclusivity,

719
00:43:13,196 --> 00:43:16,133
how about we lock it in first?

720
00:43:16,767 --> 00:43:17,734
I am...

721
00:43:18,535 --> 00:43:19,903
against it.

722
00:43:21,138 --> 00:43:23,640
No matter how luxurious
and pretty sunglasses are,

723
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:24,741
without trying them on,

724
00:43:24,741 --> 00:43:26,944
you cannot tell...

725
00:43:26,944 --> 00:43:28,278
if they suit you.

726
00:43:28,946 --> 00:43:31,148
If customers buy them just because
they're pretty and the return rate rises,

727
00:43:31,348 --> 00:43:32,783
that could pose a serious risk.

728
00:43:35,085 --> 00:43:37,020
Instead, I've got a product...

729
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:39,022
I have a strong hunch about.

730
00:43:39,923 --> 00:43:42,059
An automatic stationary bike.

731
00:43:45,662 --> 00:43:46,463
Show us.

732
00:43:48,699 --> 00:43:50,500
You rest your feet on the pedals,

733
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,903
and it moves them automatically.

734
00:43:52,903 --> 00:43:53,804
Automatically?

735
00:43:54,638 --> 00:43:55,472
I'm not sure.

736
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:57,608
Who would buy a bike
that doesn't even require working out?

737
00:43:59,042 --> 00:44:01,178
Most seniors who've had knee surgery...

738
00:44:01,178 --> 00:44:02,346
receive rehabilitation therapy...

739
00:44:02,346 --> 00:44:04,414
that moves the legs for them...

740
00:44:04,414 --> 00:44:06,283
after the procedure.

741
00:44:06,283 --> 00:44:09,119
And they know how effective it is.

742
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:13,156
As you know,
older customers' buying power

743
00:44:13,156 --> 00:44:14,358
in home shopping is no joke.

744
00:44:17,194 --> 00:44:19,263
Okay, fair point.

745
00:44:19,997 --> 00:44:21,732
Mr. Choi, reach out to the vendor.

746
00:44:23,033 --> 00:44:25,135
And like Ms. Song,

747
00:44:25,135 --> 00:44:26,603
don't limit yourselves
to your lane, everyone.

748
00:44:26,603 --> 00:44:29,206
If you've got good items, speak up.

749
00:44:29,206 --> 00:44:30,340
Yes, understood.

750
00:44:37,981 --> 00:44:39,016
Hey.

751
00:44:39,016 --> 00:44:40,951
Don't you think that was too much?

752
00:44:40,951 --> 00:44:43,453
The automatic stationary bike was my idea.

753
00:44:43,453 --> 00:44:44,755
Why did you talk like it was yours?

754
00:44:45,222 --> 00:44:46,990
What are you saying?

755
00:44:46,990 --> 00:44:48,692
Are you calling me a thief?

756
00:44:49,059 --> 00:44:51,695
What's so great
about some little idea from an intern?

757
00:44:52,029 --> 00:44:54,698
And it was the team's idea,
not yours alone.

758
00:44:54,698 --> 00:44:57,100
What? "Some little idea?"

759
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:59,436
Can you even come up with one yourself?

760
00:44:59,803 --> 00:45:00,938
What did you just say?

761
00:45:01,772 --> 00:45:03,006
I knew it.

762
00:45:03,006 --> 00:45:05,242
Weren't you the one
who asked me to help you out?

763
00:45:05,242 --> 00:45:07,044
I'm not letting this slide.

764
00:45:07,044 --> 00:45:09,613
I'll mark you for insubordination
in the mentee review,

765
00:45:09,613 --> 00:45:10,714
so get ready to be fired.

766
00:45:12,049 --> 00:45:13,517
And you think I'll just sit still?

767
00:45:14,017 --> 00:45:16,086
Run your filthy mouth one more time,

768
00:45:16,086 --> 00:45:18,455
and you'll be reported
for workplace bullying.

769
00:45:19,456 --> 00:45:21,758
And about when you lied to me
that it was a hair product...

770
00:45:21,758 --> 00:45:23,694
to dump it on me.

771
00:45:24,294 --> 00:45:26,063
You think I didn't notice?

772
00:45:30,634 --> 00:45:31,802
She's out of her mind.

773
00:45:31,802 --> 00:45:33,937
She's crazy!

774
00:45:37,241 --> 00:45:38,108
Song Ye Na.

775
00:45:38,909 --> 00:45:41,311
You dare poke the bear?

776
00:45:42,279 --> 00:45:43,981
You're dead now.

777
00:45:44,348 --> 00:45:45,682
- Mr. Choi.
- Yes?

778
00:45:46,917 --> 00:45:48,885
How are we supposed to sell those?

779
00:45:48,885 --> 00:45:51,822
We can't even swap in
something else as a decoy.

780
00:45:53,991 --> 00:45:55,092
So,

781
00:45:55,092 --> 00:45:56,927
how ripe are the apples right now?

782
00:45:57,961 --> 00:45:59,129
They're still green.

783
00:45:59,329 --> 00:46:02,065
We scheduled the broadcast
to align with the shipment,

784
00:46:02,065 --> 00:46:03,066
but because of the abnormal
weather...

785
00:46:03,066 --> 00:46:05,235
Then what do you want us to do?

786
00:46:05,235 --> 00:46:07,604
Go live from a studio
with nothing to show?

787
00:46:07,604 --> 00:46:10,540
Just say
it's a "pre-order, ships later" product?

788
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:13,410
How will we make them order?

789
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:14,244
Producer Kim.

790
00:46:14,478 --> 00:46:15,612
How about this?

791
00:46:15,846 --> 00:46:18,615
We do the broadcast from the orchard.

792
00:46:18,615 --> 00:46:20,918
Then we don't need
to switch to another product,

793
00:46:20,918 --> 00:46:23,020
and it will also look pretty convincing.

794
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:24,521
We can stress...

795
00:46:24,521 --> 00:46:27,257
that we'll ship fresh, in-season fruit
right after harvest, building trust.

796
00:46:27,457 --> 00:46:28,625
That sounds good.

797
00:46:28,625 --> 00:46:29,793
What do you think?
What do you think, Producer Choi?

798
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,062
Fresh, in-season fruit.

799
00:46:32,062 --> 00:46:33,797
That's actually not a bad idea.

800
00:46:33,797 --> 00:46:34,698
Right?

801
00:46:34,698 --> 00:46:37,367
What's good about it?

802
00:46:37,367 --> 00:46:39,369
You want us to go
all the way out of town just for that?

803
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:42,372
No way. Find another option.

804
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:46,510
Then do you have a better idea?

805
00:46:46,910 --> 00:46:49,079
Right now, that seems like our best shot.

806
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:51,648
Yeah. We don't really have
an alternative at the moment.

807
00:46:52,049 --> 00:46:54,585
Or do you have any?

808
00:46:57,054 --> 00:47:00,324
I'm trying to think of one.

809
00:47:00,324 --> 00:47:01,525
We can figure it out later.

810
00:47:01,525 --> 00:47:03,827
Later? We don't have time for later.

811
00:47:03,827 --> 00:47:05,462
Let's just go there and do it.

812
00:47:05,462 --> 00:47:07,798
Mr. Choi, coordinate the schedule
with the supplier and let me know.

813
00:47:07,798 --> 00:47:09,066
Yes, sir.

814
00:47:09,066 --> 00:47:10,634
Fresh, in-season fruit.

815
00:47:10,834 --> 00:47:11,702
Good idea.

816
00:47:12,369 --> 00:47:13,370
All right, then.

817
00:47:13,370 --> 00:47:15,205
Fresh, in-season fruit.

818
00:47:17,407 --> 00:47:18,275
Damn it.

819
00:47:28,919 --> 00:47:31,054
I need to review the spec sheet,

820
00:47:31,054 --> 00:47:32,589
so drive carefully, okay?

821
00:47:32,956 --> 00:47:33,790
Sure.

822
00:47:34,458 --> 00:47:36,426
What am I, her chauffeur or what?

823
00:47:36,693 --> 00:47:37,861
Why make me drive her around?

824
00:47:40,464 --> 00:47:42,532
By the way, did you spray perfume?

825
00:47:42,933 --> 00:47:43,767
Ms. Song?

826
00:47:46,903 --> 00:47:48,238
That's a bit concerning.

827
00:47:49,373 --> 00:47:50,674
What are you to be concerned about me?

828
00:47:51,675 --> 00:47:54,311
Intern Cho, instead of meddling
in others' business,

829
00:47:54,311 --> 00:47:57,047
maybe focus on doing
your own job properly.

830
00:47:59,016 --> 00:47:59,883
Okay.

831
00:48:19,369 --> 00:48:20,203
(Mungyeong Apples)

832
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:26,376
All done.

833
00:48:28,779 --> 00:48:30,981
Are you staying here?

834
00:48:30,981 --> 00:48:32,482
It's too hot outside.

835
00:48:32,482 --> 00:48:33,617
Call me when we're on standby.

836
00:48:33,917 --> 00:48:34,718
Okay.

837
00:48:35,886 --> 00:48:37,754
You fool.

838
00:48:37,754 --> 00:48:40,257
How can a show host plan to broadcast
without checking the site herself?

839
00:48:51,868 --> 00:48:52,869
What are you eating?

840
00:48:53,737 --> 00:48:54,805
Something to stay fit?

841
00:48:55,372 --> 00:48:56,907
Why? You want one too?

842
00:48:58,075 --> 00:48:59,276
No thanks.

843
00:48:59,276 --> 00:49:01,545
You're the one who needs to lose weight
more than I do, Intern Cho.

844
00:49:02,913 --> 00:49:05,849
Well, at least that's smarter
than starving yourself.

845
00:49:07,985 --> 00:49:08,919
I know, right?

846
00:50:01,805 --> 00:50:03,006
Where's the bathroom?

847
00:50:03,774 --> 00:50:04,708
Over there.

848
00:50:21,358 --> 00:50:23,327
Seriously?

849
00:52:33,590 --> 00:52:35,859
My face feels like it's burning.

850
00:52:38,962 --> 00:52:40,530
Is that 911? There's...

851
00:52:41,098 --> 00:52:42,366
My goodness.

852
00:52:43,433 --> 00:52:45,869
They said the ambulance took another route
and can't come here.

853
00:52:56,947 --> 00:52:59,549
What do I do? My face!

854
00:52:59,549 --> 00:53:00,550
Am I going to die?

855
00:53:00,550 --> 00:53:02,152
What if I have anaphylaxis?

856
00:53:02,152 --> 00:53:04,888
What if I get cut from the show?

857
00:53:04,888 --> 00:53:06,490
- Na Jeong.
- Yes?

858
00:53:06,490 --> 00:53:08,558
I think I'm going to pass out.

859
00:53:08,558 --> 00:53:10,227
Na Jeong, I'm going to faint.

860
00:53:10,227 --> 00:53:11,828
I can't...

861
00:53:11,828 --> 00:53:13,597
No.

862
00:53:13,597 --> 00:53:14,865
Song Ye Na, stay with me.

863
00:53:14,865 --> 00:53:17,100
Don't pass out.
We're almost at the hospital.

864
00:53:17,834 --> 00:53:19,736
You shouldn't have put on perfume.

865
00:53:19,736 --> 00:53:21,438
No. Come on.

866
00:53:21,438 --> 00:53:23,140
Stay with me.

867
00:53:23,974 --> 00:53:25,042
Please.

868
00:53:27,077 --> 00:53:28,245
Excuse me.

869
00:53:28,245 --> 00:53:29,413
Please.

870
00:53:29,413 --> 00:53:30,881
This is an emergency.
She was stung by bees.

871
00:53:33,450 --> 00:53:35,752
Hey, where are you going?

872
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:38,188
What about the broadcast?
I have to host.

873
00:53:39,056 --> 00:53:40,490
Are you insane?

874
00:53:40,490 --> 00:53:41,925
Didn't you say
you might have ana-something?

875
00:53:41,925 --> 00:53:43,093
I won't. I have to go.

876
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:44,761
Seriously?

877
00:53:45,762 --> 00:53:47,097
Give me the car key.

878
00:53:47,097 --> 00:53:47,931
No way.

879
00:53:47,931 --> 00:53:49,700
You're in no shape to go on air right now.

880
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:51,101
You need treatment first.

881
00:53:51,101 --> 00:53:53,804
What good is treatment if I miss the show?
If I blow this, I'll be fired.

882
00:53:55,172 --> 00:53:57,140
I'm already on thin ice.

883
00:53:57,140 --> 00:53:59,176
If I ruin this broadcast,
it's over for me.

884
00:54:00,544 --> 00:54:02,412
Do you know how hard I worked to get here?

885
00:54:02,913 --> 00:54:05,315
You have a husband and kids,

886
00:54:05,315 --> 00:54:07,317
but I've got nothing but my job.

887
00:54:10,754 --> 00:54:13,457
I can't breathe.

888
00:54:14,558 --> 00:54:15,959
I didn't think I'd have ana...

889
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:18,128
Ye Na, no.

890
00:54:18,128 --> 00:54:19,062
Over here!

891
00:54:20,897 --> 00:54:21,765
Ye Na.

892
00:54:34,544 --> 00:54:36,113
Thank you.

893
00:54:45,022 --> 00:54:45,889
Yes, Executive Director?

894
00:54:45,889 --> 00:54:47,124
Cho Na Jeong, where are you right now?

895
00:54:47,124 --> 00:54:49,326
I'm at the hospital.
Ye Na seems a bit better and...

896
00:54:49,326 --> 00:54:50,827
Then get to the orchard, now.

897
00:54:51,995 --> 00:54:53,797
You're the only one
who can go on air right now.

898
00:54:53,797 --> 00:54:54,898
So you'll have to do it.

899
00:54:54,898 --> 00:54:55,766
Can you handle it?

900
00:54:56,633 --> 00:54:58,135
Me?

901
00:54:58,435 --> 00:55:00,671
Did you review
the product spec sheet or not?

902
00:55:01,738 --> 00:55:03,540
Tell me now. We don't have time.

903
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:04,575
Yes, I did.

904
00:55:05,742 --> 00:55:07,477
I also checked out the site myself, but...

905
00:55:07,477 --> 00:55:08,779
Good. Then get there right away.

906
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:11,214
If you mess this up,

907
00:55:11,214 --> 00:55:13,050
me, Kim Tae Jeong, Song Ye Na,

908
00:55:13,050 --> 00:55:15,085
and you too, are all finished.

909
00:55:15,085 --> 00:55:15,886
Do you hear me?

910
00:55:18,322 --> 00:55:19,156
Yes, Executive Director.

911
00:56:00,764 --> 00:56:01,531
Hey.

912
00:56:01,531 --> 00:56:04,001
I reviewed the product spec sheet.
Price 32.9 dollars,

913
00:56:04,001 --> 00:56:06,670
packaged with air pockets,
sugar level 14 Brix or higher.

914
00:56:06,670 --> 00:56:07,437
Yes.

915
00:56:07,971 --> 00:56:09,339
Average weight 250 grams,

916
00:56:09,339 --> 00:56:10,607
this season's first harvest
of fresh apples,

917
00:56:10,607 --> 00:56:12,042
comes with 20 packs of apple juice
as a gift,

918
00:56:12,042 --> 00:56:13,176
which are available for purchase too.

919
00:56:13,176 --> 00:56:14,077
That's right.

920
00:56:14,077 --> 00:56:15,779
- Ho Dol, let's get ready.
- Yes.

921
00:56:46,643 --> 00:56:51,548
(Fresh local food is coming.)

922
00:56:53,383 --> 00:56:56,153
(100 percent fresh Korean produce)

923
00:56:56,153 --> 00:56:57,654
(Fresh local food is coming.)

924
00:57:05,429 --> 00:57:06,730
Please excuse me.

925
00:57:06,730 --> 00:57:07,464
Sorry.

926
00:57:08,799 --> 00:57:09,733
Excuse me.

927
00:57:11,068 --> 00:57:12,135
Broadcast in ten seconds.

928
00:57:22,579 --> 00:57:23,380
Five seconds.

929
00:57:25,782 --> 00:57:26,583
Four.

930
00:57:28,919 --> 00:57:29,753
Three.

931
00:57:33,223 --> 00:57:33,991
Two.

932
00:57:36,593 --> 00:57:37,427
One.

933
00:57:38,362 --> 00:57:39,196
Cue!

934
00:57:43,934 --> 00:57:45,469
Hello, dear customers.

935
00:57:45,469 --> 00:57:47,738
I'm your shopping host, Cho Na Jeong.

936
00:57:47,738 --> 00:57:51,308
Today, we're broadcasting
under this clear, beautiful sky...

937
00:57:51,308 --> 00:57:54,044
from an apple orchard in Mungyeong.

938
00:57:54,044 --> 00:57:55,779
Everyone.

939
00:57:55,779 --> 00:57:56,980
Do you see this?

940
00:57:56,980 --> 00:57:59,950
Apples hanging in clusters
on every branch.

941
00:57:59,950 --> 00:58:01,451
We wanted to bring...

942
00:58:01,451 --> 00:58:03,520
this fresh scenery straight to you,

943
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:04,955
so here we are.

944
00:58:04,955 --> 00:58:08,325
These apples you're looking at
are ripening beautifully.

945
00:58:08,325 --> 00:58:10,327
Getting ready for peak sweetness,

946
00:58:10,327 --> 00:58:12,663
getting ready for deeper color.

947
00:58:12,663 --> 00:58:13,463
Now,

948
00:58:14,131 --> 00:58:18,101
you might think apples are all the same.

949
00:58:18,702 --> 00:58:19,836
But the taste of an apple...

950
00:58:20,070 --> 00:58:23,307
depends on where it's grown,
how much sunlight it gets,

951
00:58:23,307 --> 00:58:26,143
- and when it's harvested.
- My goodness.

952
00:58:26,143 --> 00:58:27,945
Depending on them, it varies completely.

953
00:58:27,945 --> 00:58:29,446
- Here in Mungyeong,
- My goodness.

954
00:58:29,446 --> 00:58:32,149
the wide temperature swings
make the flesh firm...

955
00:58:32,149 --> 00:58:34,785
and wonderfully crisp.

956
00:58:34,785 --> 00:58:36,587
That's why it's known
for its high sweetness,

957
00:58:36,587 --> 00:58:38,422
a gentle tartness,

958
00:58:38,422 --> 00:58:39,856
and a perfectly balanced flavor.

959
00:58:39,856 --> 00:58:41,358
Sweet Home Shopping, right?

960
00:58:41,792 --> 00:58:44,628
I'd like to place an order
for what's on air right now.

961
00:58:45,095 --> 00:58:46,630
Let me take a bite.

962
00:58:46,630 --> 00:58:51,101
(500 sets sold)

963
00:58:51,568 --> 00:58:52,436
Yes.

964
00:58:52,869 --> 00:58:53,770
Yes.

965
00:58:54,838 --> 00:58:56,873
Crisp texture,

966
00:58:56,873 --> 00:58:58,342
bursting juice.

967
00:58:58,342 --> 00:58:59,876
How wonderfully fresh.

968
00:59:00,644 --> 00:59:02,646
No need for a long pitch.

969
00:59:02,646 --> 00:59:04,881
Let me show you today's deal right away.

970
00:59:06,016 --> 00:59:06,850
Here we go.

971
00:59:07,084 --> 00:59:08,118
This year's first harvest,

972
00:59:08,118 --> 00:59:11,355
Mungyeong Premium Fresh Apples,
a five kilogram box.

973
00:59:11,355 --> 00:59:14,858
If you order now, it's only 32.9 dollars.

974
00:59:14,858 --> 00:59:18,262
Since it's a pre-order,
we've slashed the price.

975
00:59:18,262 --> 00:59:19,129
And...

976
00:59:19,129 --> 00:59:21,365
even at a local farmer's market,

977
00:59:21,365 --> 00:59:24,134
you won't find a deal this good.

978
00:59:24,801 --> 00:59:25,936
They'll be picked next week...

979
00:59:25,936 --> 00:59:28,338
at peak flavor,

980
00:59:28,338 --> 00:59:30,874
and shipped directly from the orchard.

981
00:59:31,275 --> 00:59:33,677
You might wonder,

982
00:59:33,677 --> 00:59:35,879
"How can that be so cheap?"

983
00:59:35,879 --> 00:59:39,683
Well, this special broadcast...

984
00:59:39,683 --> 00:59:40,884
was made possible...

985
00:59:40,884 --> 00:59:43,387
through close collaboration
with the farmer, that's why.

986
00:59:43,387 --> 00:59:46,223
So remember,

987
00:59:46,223 --> 00:59:47,591
this offer is only valid today.

988
00:59:47,591 --> 00:59:51,261
We currently have 800 customers ordering.

989
00:59:51,261 --> 00:59:53,964
The average sweetness is over 14 Brix,

990
00:59:53,964 --> 00:59:57,567
with Mungyeong apples' signature
sweet, refreshing flavor.

991
00:59:57,567 --> 00:59:59,202
Once you taste it,

992
00:59:59,202 --> 01:00:02,606
you'll see how special
farm-direct shipping is.

993
01:00:02,606 --> 01:00:04,608
As we speak,

994
01:00:04,608 --> 01:00:06,710
we've just passed...

995
01:00:06,710 --> 01:00:08,278
one thousand customers.

996
01:00:08,278 --> 01:00:11,548
Please note that calls may be delayed.

997
01:00:11,548 --> 01:00:13,383
We apologize for the delay.

998
01:00:13,383 --> 01:00:15,852
But remember,
you can also order through the app.

999
01:00:35,105 --> 01:00:35,973
Great job.

1000
01:00:35,973 --> 01:00:37,641
Thank you so much.

1001
01:00:38,075 --> 01:00:39,176
You were incredible.

1002
01:00:39,176 --> 01:00:40,277
Not at all.

1003
01:00:40,277 --> 01:00:41,612
- Take care.
- Yes.

1004
01:00:41,612 --> 01:00:43,146
- Great work, Ms. Cho.
- Tae Jeong.

1005
01:00:43,146 --> 01:00:44,248
How's Ye Na?

1006
01:00:44,548 --> 01:00:47,017
She's okay now.
Her swelling's gone down.

1007
01:00:47,017 --> 01:00:48,719
Thank goodness.

1008
01:00:48,719 --> 01:00:49,486
Yes.

1009
01:00:50,554 --> 01:00:53,557
Sorry, though.
I couldn't sell out completely.

1010
01:00:53,557 --> 01:00:56,159
What are you talking about?
We hit 80 percent sales.

1011
01:00:56,159 --> 01:00:58,562
Considering what happened,
that's a miracle.

1012
01:00:59,896 --> 01:01:01,632
I'd forgotten how good you are, Ms. Cho,

1013
01:01:02,666 --> 01:01:04,334
and how you always had my back
when things were tough.

1014
01:01:04,868 --> 01:01:06,837
You're flattering me.

1015
01:01:07,671 --> 01:01:09,273
There's some apple juice left.
Would you like some?

1016
01:01:09,273 --> 01:01:10,774
- Sure, let's go.
- Yes.

1017
01:01:29,259 --> 01:01:30,160
Hello?

1018
01:01:31,962 --> 01:01:32,996
Are you on your way back?

1019
01:01:34,331 --> 01:01:36,266
Yes, we're almost there now.

1020
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:38,302
Then I'll keep it short.

1021
01:01:39,236 --> 01:01:40,604
From what I saw today,

1022
01:01:40,604 --> 01:01:43,240
you're ready to stop observing
and start hosting again.

1023
01:01:45,876 --> 01:01:47,210
For fairness,

1024
01:01:47,210 --> 01:01:49,179
you'll begin as a co-host, not the main.

1025
01:01:49,913 --> 01:01:50,847
Does that sound good?

1026
01:01:51,548 --> 01:01:53,050
Yes.

1027
01:01:53,050 --> 01:01:54,952
Welcome back, Cho Na Jeong.

1028
01:01:55,686 --> 01:01:58,589
What matters most is from here on,
so don't let your guard down.

1029
01:02:00,724 --> 01:02:02,326
Understood, Executive Director.

1030
01:02:03,293 --> 01:02:04,294
Thank you.

1031
01:02:31,521 --> 01:02:32,456
Refreshing, right?

1032
01:02:34,191 --> 01:02:36,159
This is small, but it's actually powerful.

1033
01:02:56,346 --> 01:02:57,247
What's this about?

1034
01:02:58,482 --> 01:02:59,449
Producer Noh.

1035
01:03:00,584 --> 01:03:02,619
You don't want Na Jeong
staying at Sweet Home Shopping, do you?

1036
01:03:04,988 --> 01:03:06,256
Can you make her leave?

1037
01:03:07,324 --> 01:03:08,125
What?

1038
01:04:24,868 --> 01:04:27,004
(Don't call me ma'am)

1039
01:04:27,971 --> 01:04:30,107
Why am I imagining things?

1040
01:04:32,276 --> 01:04:33,744
She hasn't even asked lately.

1041
01:04:33,744 --> 01:04:35,479
If anything, I'm relieved.

1042
01:04:35,479 --> 01:04:36,446
What are you doing here?

1043
01:04:37,714 --> 01:04:39,182
Rebecca.

1044
01:04:39,883 --> 01:04:41,618
I'm your biggest fan, Blunt Sister.

1045
01:04:41,618 --> 01:04:42,786
She suddenly called me...

1046
01:04:42,786 --> 01:04:44,521
and said she's in menopause now...

1047
01:04:44,521 --> 01:04:46,523
and that she doesn't need pads anymore.

1048
01:04:46,857 --> 01:04:48,792
Please share with us...

1049
01:04:48,792 --> 01:04:50,961
what matters most to you.

1050
01:04:50,961 --> 01:04:51,828
Vibes.

1051
01:04:51,828 --> 01:04:52,529
Did you tell them...

1052
01:04:52,529 --> 01:04:54,631
to cut me and make Yang Mi Sook
the co-host instead?

1053
01:04:54,631 --> 01:04:55,465
Yes.

1054
01:04:55,465 --> 01:04:57,100
You're no different from me, Na Jeong.

1055
01:04:57,100 --> 01:04:59,136
How can you stay so calm...

1056
01:04:59,136 --> 01:05:00,370
when your own mentor can't be reached?

1057
01:05:01,438 --> 01:05:03,073
Ye Na.

1058
01:05:06,643 --> 01:05:08,645
(Subtitles are provided by KOCOWA.)
