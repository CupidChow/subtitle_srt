1
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,021
(This drama is a work of fiction.
Names and contents of people, places,)

2
00:00:29,021 --> 00:00:30,022
(organizations, events, and backgrounds
are not related to real life.)

3
00:00:30,022 --> 00:00:31,023
(Child actors filmed under guardian
supervision in a safe environment.)

4
00:00:33,592 --> 00:00:38,964
(2019)

5
00:00:39,465 --> 00:00:42,601
I've been trying it at home,
and the coverage is really amazing.

6
00:00:42,935 --> 00:00:44,203
And it doesn't transfer.

7
00:00:45,304 --> 00:00:46,539
How is it?

8
00:00:46,539 --> 00:00:48,607
Moms really hate looking shiny,

9
00:00:48,607 --> 00:00:49,642
and this stays matte.

10
00:00:50,109 --> 00:00:51,810
It even feels nice and cooling.

11
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:54,079
I think it'd be good if Ye Na and I
take turns doing the demo.

12
00:00:55,814 --> 00:00:56,916
Producer Noh.

13
00:00:56,916 --> 00:00:57,783
Yes?

14
00:00:57,783 --> 00:01:00,452
I'm only saying this because
it's your first time handling cosmetics.

15
00:01:00,452 --> 00:01:03,322
This much is a top tier finish
and coverage.

16
00:01:04,957 --> 00:01:06,358
Ye Na, how was it for you?

17
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:08,160
I think it's great.

18
00:01:08,961 --> 00:01:11,130
You have dry skin, right?

19
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:12,598
How long does it last?

20
00:01:12,598 --> 00:01:15,100
How long was it again?

21
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:21,440
Seriously?

22
00:01:24,443 --> 00:01:26,145
Why do you keep staring at me like that?

23
00:01:26,145 --> 00:01:27,980
Is something bothering you, Producer Noh?

24
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:30,015
Well,

25
00:01:32,117 --> 00:01:34,553
are you not sleeping well
these days, Ms. Cho?

26
00:01:35,855 --> 00:01:36,722
Sorry?

27
00:01:37,289 --> 00:01:39,325
Why do you have
so many bumps on your face?

28
00:01:41,594 --> 00:01:43,095
They're pimples. Okay.

29
00:01:46,866 --> 00:01:49,668
I guess you like being blunt.

30
00:01:50,202 --> 00:01:53,005
So this makes it perfect
for showing off the coverage, right?

31
00:01:53,005 --> 00:01:53,906
Here, look.

32
00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:55,374
Here's the before,

33
00:01:57,243 --> 00:01:58,878
and the after.

34
00:02:07,086 --> 00:02:07,987
No.

35
00:02:08,387 --> 00:02:09,722
Instead of the demo,

36
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:12,825
let's build the segment
around the special bonuses and gifts.

37
00:02:12,825 --> 00:02:15,594
This main product alone
is 75 dollars at the department store,

38
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:18,864
but this package includes two refills,
concealer, essence, and facial mist.

39
00:02:18,864 --> 00:02:20,099
Listen, Producer Noh.

40
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:23,636
The biggest strength
of Perfect Cushion is its coverage.

41
00:02:23,636 --> 00:02:26,705
It's already been proven in blind tests,
and I've tried it myself.

42
00:02:26,705 --> 00:02:29,909
And above all, showing the demo...

43
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:32,578
is the best way to grab
the viewers' attention...

44
00:02:33,412 --> 00:02:34,313
I'm not sure.

45
00:02:35,814 --> 00:02:38,083
If that gets caught on camera,

46
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:39,785
they're going to look
way bigger than you think.

47
00:02:41,954 --> 00:02:42,821
The pimples.

48
00:02:45,057 --> 00:02:48,060
Anyway, since the configuration
is this product's strength,

49
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,662
let's just do it my way.

50
00:02:50,095 --> 00:02:52,231
What a jerk.

51
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,268
He's so annoying.

52
00:02:56,268 --> 00:02:59,238
Why pick on someone's looks?
Unbelievable.

53
00:03:00,206 --> 00:03:03,442
Still, I heard he was a promising producer
back at Our Home Shopping.

54
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:06,445
And he's good-looking.

55
00:03:06,445 --> 00:03:08,714
Good-looking? Says who?

56
00:03:08,714 --> 00:03:11,584
Just because someone's good-looking,
they get to be rude?

57
00:03:12,852 --> 00:03:16,255
It's still way better
than some ugly guy being rude.

58
00:03:16,255 --> 00:03:17,089
Wait.

59
00:03:17,423 --> 00:03:19,358
Did you even try the product?

60
00:03:20,526 --> 00:03:22,561
Of course, I did.
You did too, right?

61
00:03:22,795 --> 00:03:25,331
Then why couldn't you answer
when I asked about wear time?

62
00:03:28,467 --> 00:03:30,002
How many times have I told you?

63
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:31,637
You always have to study the product...

64
00:03:31,637 --> 00:03:33,706
and make it your own before going on air.

65
00:03:34,073 --> 00:03:36,408
You can't just rely on the producer
spoon-feeding you everything.

66
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:38,110
Actually...

67
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,144
Forget it.

68
00:03:42,882 --> 00:03:44,250
This is driving me crazy.

69
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:47,419
Why do these always come up
every time I ovulate?

70
00:03:47,786 --> 00:03:49,121
Hello, everyone.

71
00:03:49,455 --> 00:03:53,459
Bringing you the most perfect
Perfect Cushion package,

72
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:55,294
I'm your show host, Cho Na Jeong.

73
00:03:55,294 --> 00:03:57,263
And I'm show host Song Ye Na.

74
00:03:57,263 --> 00:03:58,697
Today,

75
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:01,634
we're introducing a product
everyone's talking about.

76
00:04:01,634 --> 00:04:02,968
Perfect Cushion!

77
00:04:02,968 --> 00:04:05,037
It doesn't transfer.

78
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:07,239
As for coverage,

79
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:09,175
it ranked number one in blind testing.

80
00:04:09,175 --> 00:04:10,409
Start with the package.

81
00:04:10,843 --> 00:04:13,846
Let me walk you through the package.

82
00:04:14,113 --> 00:04:17,449
This is the exact same product
currently sold at department stores.

83
00:04:17,449 --> 00:04:21,153
The cushion that sells for 75 dollars
at department stores,

84
00:04:21,153 --> 00:04:22,821
and from Perfect,

85
00:04:22,821 --> 00:04:25,157
something they really rarely ever include,

86
00:04:25,157 --> 00:04:27,660
the antioxidant essence base,

87
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,496
plus two refills and a concealer,

88
00:04:30,763 --> 00:04:31,864
and you also get a facial mist.

89
00:04:31,864 --> 00:04:33,132
And for all that?

90
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,202
For all that, 79.90 dollars.

91
00:04:36,202 --> 00:04:39,205
Yes, can you believe it?

92
00:04:39,205 --> 00:04:40,706
Please show the demo.

93
00:04:40,706 --> 00:04:42,942
- Show the coverage, please.
- This package, at this price?

94
00:04:42,942 --> 00:04:45,511
A groundbreaking package...

95
00:04:45,511 --> 00:04:46,846
first introduced here
on Sweet Home Shopping.

96
00:04:46,846 --> 00:04:48,614
The lines are good. Now show the demo.

97
00:04:48,614 --> 00:04:49,448
What the...

98
00:04:49,448 --> 00:04:51,317
He told me not to do demos in the meeting.

99
00:04:51,317 --> 00:04:54,253
Okay, let me show you the case.

100
00:04:54,486 --> 00:04:55,721
First of all,

101
00:04:55,721 --> 00:04:59,458
we've gotten so many compliments
on how pretty the case is.

102
00:04:59,458 --> 00:05:00,926
Isn't it so sleek?

103
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:03,062
Now, when you open it,

104
00:05:03,062 --> 00:05:04,163
there's the puff.

105
00:05:04,163 --> 00:05:06,499
Now it's showtime.

106
00:05:06,499 --> 00:05:08,334
This magical coverage,

107
00:05:08,334 --> 00:05:11,537
you won't believe it
unless we show you live.

108
00:05:11,537 --> 00:05:12,972
That pimple is too big.

109
00:05:12,972 --> 00:05:14,640
Ms. Song should do it, not you.

110
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,243
Ye Na, could you demonstrate as well?

111
00:05:17,243 --> 00:05:18,544
Sure.

112
00:05:18,544 --> 00:05:20,880
Let me show you...

113
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,681
how much brighter the skin tone looks.

114
00:05:22,982 --> 00:05:25,084
Say something. Don't just do the demo.

115
00:05:25,084 --> 00:05:26,785
You have to explain features
and ingredients too.

116
00:05:27,753 --> 00:05:28,621
Okay.

117
00:05:29,355 --> 00:05:32,091
Look, both sides look
completely different, right?

118
00:05:32,391 --> 00:05:35,094
We're having trouble
connecting callers right now.

119
00:05:35,094 --> 00:05:37,963
Please use the app
or the automated order line.

120
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:39,565
Now, moving to CTA video.

121
00:05:39,565 --> 00:05:41,300
Video 3, cut.

122
00:05:46,539 --> 00:05:47,473
Producer Noh.

123
00:05:47,773 --> 00:05:49,575
If the plan changed,
you should request it.

124
00:05:49,575 --> 00:05:50,776
Why do you talk like that?

125
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:53,612
Calls are pouring in. Please focus.

126
00:05:53,612 --> 00:05:54,547
Okay, focus.

127
00:05:56,115 --> 00:05:57,616
Camera 1, standby.

128
00:05:59,451 --> 00:06:00,252
Cue!

129
00:06:02,888 --> 00:06:04,023
Everyone.

130
00:06:04,023 --> 00:06:07,459
Over 10,000 people
have already placed their orders.

131
00:06:07,459 --> 00:06:11,330
This package is only available
during this broadcast,

132
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:14,033
so you'll really regret missing it.

133
00:06:14,033 --> 00:06:16,068
Try it today.

134
00:06:16,068 --> 00:06:18,270
Your skin will change.

135
00:06:19,305 --> 00:06:20,406
Sold out.

136
00:06:25,978 --> 00:06:27,479
You didn't forget
about this week's team dinner, right?

137
00:06:28,581 --> 00:06:29,582
Producer Noh.

138
00:06:29,849 --> 00:06:31,851
Why do you talk to people that way?

139
00:06:31,851 --> 00:06:34,019
Don't you know the hosts get thrown off
when you talk like that?

140
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:35,855
You say no demos,

141
00:06:35,855 --> 00:06:37,456
then you order a demo again?

142
00:06:37,456 --> 00:06:40,092
At least explain why.

143
00:06:40,092 --> 00:06:43,496
How can I explain everything
in the little time we have?

144
00:06:43,963 --> 00:06:45,397
And shouldn't a show host...

145
00:06:45,397 --> 00:06:47,800
be flexible enough to adapt on the spot?

146
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,736
Is this how you've always run
your shows, Producer Noh?

147
00:06:51,103 --> 00:06:52,838
We sold out.

148
00:06:52,838 --> 00:06:55,207
Why make such a big deal out of nothing?

149
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:57,009
Nothing?

150
00:06:57,009 --> 00:06:59,411
Let go of me.

151
00:06:59,812 --> 00:07:01,914
Look here, Producer Noh Won Bin.

152
00:07:02,515 --> 00:07:04,517
Do you think a shopping host...

153
00:07:04,517 --> 00:07:06,051
is just a parrot
repeating whatever you say?

154
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:08,087
And you call yourself a pro?

155
00:07:08,087 --> 00:07:09,822
Really?

156
00:07:09,822 --> 00:07:12,525
Say something.
Talk like you did earlier.

157
00:07:12,525 --> 00:07:14,426
Cat got your tongue
now that I set the stage for you?

158
00:07:14,426 --> 00:07:17,396
Go on.
Talk like earlier, you piece of garbage.

159
00:07:27,373 --> 00:07:28,240
Stop.

160
00:07:40,386 --> 00:07:43,222
Ms. Cho, I'm sorry.

161
00:07:44,924 --> 00:07:47,760
The truth is,
I've only been a producer for three years.

162
00:07:48,294 --> 00:07:51,530
People around me said I needed
to establish dominance early on,

163
00:07:52,698 --> 00:07:54,099
so I overstepped.

164
00:07:56,368 --> 00:07:57,570
I'm really sorry.

165
00:07:58,504 --> 00:07:59,471
Producer Noh.

166
00:08:00,906 --> 00:08:03,175
When a show host is on stage,

167
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:06,312
it feels like they're standing...

168
00:08:06,312 --> 00:08:10,115
in the middle of an eight-lane highway
wearing nothing but a bikini.

169
00:08:10,649 --> 00:08:13,719
And if you put them on the spot there,

170
00:08:13,719 --> 00:08:15,421
imagine how lonely they'd feel.

171
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:21,227
Ms. Cho, I...

172
00:08:22,228 --> 00:08:24,363
I'm sorry, Ms. Cho.

173
00:08:27,099 --> 00:08:28,701
Seriously.

174
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:33,272
Anyway, I'm also sorry...

175
00:08:33,272 --> 00:08:35,374
for calling you a piece of garbage.

176
00:08:36,108 --> 00:08:37,042
No.

177
00:08:37,743 --> 00:08:39,278
I am a piece of garbage. Yes, I am.

178
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:41,046
I'm a total piece of garbage.

179
00:09:01,167 --> 00:09:03,469
Wait, why is he handsome?

180
00:09:05,371 --> 00:09:08,007
You're really handsome.

181
00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:11,277
You actually are.

182
00:09:15,748 --> 00:09:16,882
Where do you live?

183
00:09:18,017 --> 00:09:18,884
Ms. Cho.

184
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,889
Ms. Cho, where do you live?

185
00:09:25,391 --> 00:09:26,392
Nowhere.

186
00:09:26,392 --> 00:09:28,460
You can't stay here.

187
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:31,530
We both have work tomorrow.

188
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,833
So tell me. Where do you live?

189
00:09:34,466 --> 00:09:37,870
I don't have a home.
I'm garbage, remember?

190
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:40,072
I already told you I'm the garbage.

191
00:09:40,072 --> 00:09:40,873
Right.

192
00:09:40,873 --> 00:09:44,476
But seriously, if you stay here like this,
you're going to get in trouble.

193
00:09:44,476 --> 00:09:46,812
Where do you live? Your place.

194
00:09:47,913 --> 00:09:49,348
- My place?
- Yes.

195
00:09:50,983 --> 00:09:51,917
My place...

196
00:09:52,418 --> 00:09:53,452
is right there!

197
00:09:53,452 --> 00:09:54,320
Where?

198
00:09:55,321 --> 00:09:56,388
(Hotel)

199
00:09:57,089 --> 00:09:57,857
What?

200
00:09:57,857 --> 00:09:59,625
You're garbage, Cho Na Jeong.

201
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,327
That place over there is my home!

202
00:10:01,327 --> 00:10:03,295
Be careful.
You're going to get into trouble that way.

203
00:10:08,133 --> 00:10:09,702
Let's get into big trouble.

204
00:10:10,603 --> 00:10:11,804
Catch me if you can.

205
00:10:12,738 --> 00:10:13,906
Seriously?

206
00:10:14,473 --> 00:10:16,408
Why are you doing this to me?

207
00:10:17,009 --> 00:10:18,210
Your bag is right here.

208
00:10:18,611 --> 00:10:20,379
Na Jeong, wait for me.

209
00:10:22,848 --> 00:10:24,750
You already caught me.

210
00:10:26,218 --> 00:10:30,756
(Hotel)

211
00:10:39,632 --> 00:10:45,437
(Intensive Care Unit)

212
00:10:47,907 --> 00:10:50,376
(Executive Director Seo Gyeong Seon)

213
00:10:52,745 --> 00:10:53,712
Yes?

214
00:10:53,712 --> 00:10:55,781
Won Bin, I heard the news.

215
00:10:55,781 --> 00:10:57,316
She still hasn't woken up?

216
00:10:57,316 --> 00:10:59,118
But she's not in critical danger, right?

217
00:10:59,752 --> 00:11:01,086
Yes, it seems that way.

218
00:11:03,122 --> 00:11:04,657
Anyway, thank you for all your work.

219
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:08,360
And I'm telling you this so you don't
go around saying something you shouldn't.

220
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,663
This is no one's fault.

221
00:11:10,663 --> 00:11:11,530
Understand?

222
00:11:15,835 --> 00:11:16,836
No.

223
00:11:17,703 --> 00:11:18,737
It's my fault.

224
00:11:21,207 --> 00:11:23,008
If I hadn't pulled out at the end,

225
00:11:23,008 --> 00:11:24,510
it wouldn't have gotten this bad.

226
00:11:26,712 --> 00:11:28,080
I looked away just to save myself,

227
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:31,650
to protect my own family.

228
00:11:36,989 --> 00:11:38,324
It's all my fault.

229
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:54,573
Honey.

230
00:11:55,207 --> 00:11:56,308
What's going on?

231
00:11:57,142 --> 00:11:58,477
So did she die?

232
00:12:00,346 --> 00:12:01,313
Damn it.

233
00:12:04,383 --> 00:12:05,584
She didn't die, right?

234
00:12:06,151 --> 00:12:07,019
Right?

235
00:12:07,786 --> 00:12:09,455
Damn it.

236
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,462
Be honest.

237
00:12:17,796 --> 00:12:20,799
Did you contact Kim Seon Min after that?

238
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:22,168
What are you talking about?

239
00:12:22,535 --> 00:12:24,470
Never! I swear!

240
00:12:26,472 --> 00:12:28,107
I told you already.

241
00:12:28,707 --> 00:12:30,876
She wasn't the victim, but I was.

242
00:12:31,343 --> 00:12:32,411
Then what about Song Ye Na?

243
00:12:35,247 --> 00:12:36,248
No.

244
00:12:36,248 --> 00:12:37,483
Be honest!

245
00:12:37,483 --> 00:12:39,818
I said no! I didn't!

246
00:12:42,755 --> 00:12:43,989
Listen carefully, Kim Jeong Sik.

247
00:12:45,524 --> 00:12:48,761
The reason I haven't divorced
a bastard like you...

248
00:12:48,761 --> 00:12:50,729
is not because I trust you
or care about you.

249
00:12:52,064 --> 00:12:53,265
It's because I don't want
trash like you...

250
00:12:53,265 --> 00:12:55,601
to leave a stain on my career,

251
00:12:55,601 --> 00:12:58,204
and because I refuse to let
my daughter's life get ruined.

252
00:12:59,572 --> 00:13:02,007
So if you pull even one reckless stunt,

253
00:13:02,007 --> 00:13:03,843
before the law judges you,

254
00:13:05,578 --> 00:13:06,812
I'm going to kill you myself.

255
00:13:08,347 --> 00:13:09,281
Do you hear me?

256
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:11,784
Damn it.

257
00:13:29,668 --> 00:13:30,669
You scared me.

258
00:13:32,438 --> 00:13:33,405
What are you doing here?

259
00:13:41,046 --> 00:13:42,548
You reek of alcohol.

260
00:13:43,482 --> 00:13:45,184
Why did you drink so much?

261
00:13:45,851 --> 00:13:46,719
Hey.

262
00:13:51,056 --> 00:13:51,991
Deputy Editor?

263
00:13:54,894 --> 00:13:57,196
Hi, Deputy Editor!
What a surprise running into you here.

264
00:13:59,565 --> 00:14:01,567
This is my usual spot.

265
00:14:02,434 --> 00:14:04,336
Manager Eom must've brought you here.

266
00:14:05,604 --> 00:14:06,605
Let's go somewhere else.

267
00:14:08,607 --> 00:14:10,776
Let's just sit here.

268
00:14:10,776 --> 00:14:12,211
Come here.

269
00:14:13,913 --> 00:14:15,881
It's okay if we sit here, right?

270
00:14:16,382 --> 00:14:17,483
I said let's go somewhere else.

271
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:19,151
No.

272
00:14:19,151 --> 00:14:20,886
Why should we go somewhere else?

273
00:14:24,456 --> 00:14:25,291
Hey.

274
00:14:26,325 --> 00:14:28,194
Is she the one who had an affair
with Eom Jong Do?

275
00:14:29,361 --> 00:14:30,196
Yeah.

276
00:14:30,763 --> 00:14:32,198
That bitch.

277
00:14:34,967 --> 00:14:36,869
You must be her friends.

278
00:14:36,869 --> 00:14:38,871
We came to see an exhibit nearby,

279
00:14:38,871 --> 00:14:40,072
and heard this place was a hot spot.

280
00:14:41,106 --> 00:14:42,575
But Deputy Editor,

281
00:14:43,075 --> 00:14:44,877
you didn't lose your mood
because of us, right?

282
00:14:45,744 --> 00:14:46,812
Of course not.

283
00:14:47,847 --> 00:14:51,550
"Blunt Sister's Sensible Advice"
is so fun these days.

284
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:52,985
Especially that one...

285
00:14:52,985 --> 00:14:55,354
where the show hosts appeared
and spilled everything.

286
00:14:56,455 --> 00:14:57,590
Was that your idea?

287
00:14:58,157 --> 00:14:59,091
Yes.

288
00:14:59,558 --> 00:15:00,960
See?

289
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,395
This is why I can't bring myself
to fire our deputy editor.

290
00:15:07,299 --> 00:15:10,102
I was joking.
Why are you staring at me like that?

291
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:12,638
But who's this?

292
00:15:15,241 --> 00:15:17,409
Your new boyfriend?

293
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:18,677
Yes.

294
00:15:19,345 --> 00:15:21,113
Nice to meet you.

295
00:15:21,113 --> 00:15:24,817
I'm Il Ri's new boyfriend, Byeon Sang Gyu.

296
00:15:28,087 --> 00:15:30,656
Judging by the vibe,
you're Il Ri's coworkers.

297
00:15:30,656 --> 00:15:31,657
Right?

298
00:15:31,657 --> 00:15:32,458
Yes.

299
00:15:33,692 --> 00:15:34,660
What would you like to have?

300
00:15:34,894 --> 00:15:35,928
Tonight, it's all on me.

301
00:15:35,928 --> 00:15:38,297
As a way of asking you
to be nice to Il Ri.

302
00:15:38,697 --> 00:15:40,799
Excuse me, could we get the menu here?

303
00:15:42,134 --> 00:15:44,703
Your new boyfriend is so cool,
Deputy Editor.

304
00:15:44,703 --> 00:15:45,504
The best.

305
00:15:45,738 --> 00:15:47,773
Then we can order
something expensive, right?

306
00:15:47,773 --> 00:15:49,008
Of course.

307
00:15:49,008 --> 00:15:50,743
Just order whatever you want.

308
00:15:51,911 --> 00:15:52,878
Okay.

309
00:15:56,482 --> 00:15:57,449
Wait, Il Ri.

310
00:15:58,117 --> 00:15:58,951
Come here a sec.

311
00:16:00,119 --> 00:16:03,355
Why is your face so red?
Are you not feeling well?

312
00:16:03,355 --> 00:16:05,191
- No...
- Hold still.

313
00:16:08,527 --> 00:16:10,696
You're burning up.

314
00:16:10,696 --> 00:16:11,564
No, I'm...

315
00:16:11,564 --> 00:16:13,499
Are you okay, baby?

316
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,302
I don't want you to get sick.

317
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:34,920
This is embarrassing.

318
00:16:35,254 --> 00:16:37,389
I was blushing like crazy.

319
00:16:38,157 --> 00:16:40,025
What is Sang Gyu thinking?

320
00:16:40,926 --> 00:16:43,128
Whatever. I'll just play along for now.

321
00:16:43,896 --> 00:16:45,798
It'd be weird to suddenly say
it was a lie.

322
00:16:51,837 --> 00:16:52,838
Be honest.

323
00:16:53,772 --> 00:16:54,974
He's not really your boyfriend, is he?

324
00:16:55,674 --> 00:16:56,542
Why do you care?

325
00:16:57,576 --> 00:16:59,612
People say tastes change with age.

326
00:16:59,612 --> 00:17:01,981
So do you like someone local
and old-fashioned now?

327
00:17:01,981 --> 00:17:03,949
My taste used to be pretty terrible.

328
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:06,085
I'm just trying to upgrade.

329
00:17:08,087 --> 00:17:09,321
We need to talk.

330
00:17:09,622 --> 00:17:10,990
I have nothing to say, so get lost.

331
00:17:12,024 --> 00:17:13,626
I said let's talk.

332
00:17:13,626 --> 00:17:15,227
- Let go!
- Il Ri.

333
00:17:16,662 --> 00:17:18,764
What do you think you're doing
to my girlfriend?

334
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,101
Let go of me.

335
00:17:24,036 --> 00:17:25,204
I said let go.

336
00:17:31,277 --> 00:17:32,111
Hey.

337
00:17:33,746 --> 00:17:35,080
The past is the past.

338
00:17:36,448 --> 00:17:38,250
It's already over between you two,
isn't it?

339
00:17:39,585 --> 00:17:41,420
Aren't you ashamed
in front of your current girlfriend?

340
00:17:47,326 --> 00:17:48,160
Damn it.

341
00:17:57,169 --> 00:17:58,037
Let's go.

342
00:17:58,537 --> 00:17:59,605
Honey, where are you going?

343
00:17:59,605 --> 00:18:01,507
- Come.
- Honey.

344
00:18:01,841 --> 00:18:02,741
Eom Jong Do.

345
00:18:03,876 --> 00:18:05,811
He's so annoying.

346
00:18:08,013 --> 00:18:09,882
Those guys.

347
00:18:10,182 --> 00:18:12,685
Look at all this food they ordered
that they're not even going to eat.

348
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:35,841
Right.

349
00:18:35,841 --> 00:18:37,877
I need to make a quick call.

350
00:18:37,877 --> 00:18:39,445
Do you guys want to go first?

351
00:18:39,445 --> 00:18:40,980
Go on, I'll be right behind you.

352
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:41,881
Hey!

353
00:18:42,414 --> 00:18:44,216
We'll wait for you.
Come when you're done.

354
00:18:50,623 --> 00:18:52,725
Do you want to sit on that bench
for a bit while we wait?

355
00:18:53,325 --> 00:18:54,426
Yes.

356
00:18:54,426 --> 00:18:55,261
Over there.

357
00:19:15,047 --> 00:19:16,482
Thanks for today, dude.

358
00:19:17,983 --> 00:19:19,585
I didn't do anything.

359
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:21,387
He seemed strange.

360
00:19:23,022 --> 00:19:25,524
But still,
you pretended to be my boyfriend...

361
00:19:25,524 --> 00:19:26,959
when you like someone else.

362
00:19:28,894 --> 00:19:29,662
Pretended?

363
00:19:31,864 --> 00:19:35,134
That sounds kind of sad.

364
00:19:35,901 --> 00:19:37,870
Why? It's true.

365
00:19:38,637 --> 00:19:40,873
I feel sorry for whoever it is.

366
00:19:42,074 --> 00:19:43,209
Did you tell her how you feel?

367
00:19:44,443 --> 00:19:45,244
No.

368
00:19:46,378 --> 00:19:47,213
Why not?

369
00:19:48,247 --> 00:19:52,184
I just feel like I need some time.

370
00:19:52,985 --> 00:19:53,919
For what?

371
00:19:56,021 --> 00:19:58,490
I need time to think...

372
00:19:59,425 --> 00:20:02,428
about what I should say
to best express my feelings.

373
00:20:04,797 --> 00:20:05,831
Lucky her.

374
00:20:06,165 --> 00:20:07,700
You're so serious.

375
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,835
Who is it? Someone I know?

376
00:20:16,242 --> 00:20:17,076
Hey.

377
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:20,746
Do you really not know,
or are you pretending not to know?

378
00:20:24,149 --> 00:20:25,284
You knew...

379
00:20:26,385 --> 00:20:27,820
I liked you.

380
00:20:28,821 --> 00:20:29,922
And you know...

381
00:20:31,023 --> 00:20:33,692
I still like you.

382
00:20:36,295 --> 00:20:39,265
It's been 20 years
since we met again like this, right?

383
00:20:41,667 --> 00:20:42,868
It's crazy.

384
00:20:44,937 --> 00:20:45,838
Are you...

385
00:20:47,573 --> 00:20:48,607
Lee Il Ri?

386
00:20:52,711 --> 00:20:53,445
Hey.

387
00:20:55,881 --> 00:20:58,050
Hey, are you okay?

388
00:20:58,684 --> 00:21:00,386
The moment I saw you that day,

389
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,489
it felt like I'd gotten in a time machine.

390
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:05,624
I knew right away.

391
00:21:08,127 --> 00:21:09,195
In my whole life,

392
00:21:10,196 --> 00:21:12,398
I'd never liked anyone
as much as I liked you.

393
00:21:16,101 --> 00:21:17,436
Unbelievable.

394
00:21:20,539 --> 00:21:23,909
I wanted to confess to you
in a really cool way,

395
00:21:25,144 --> 00:21:26,045
but I failed.

396
00:21:29,081 --> 00:21:30,950
Since it's already come to this,
I guess there's nothing we can do.

397
00:21:36,121 --> 00:21:36,956
Il Ri.

398
00:21:39,558 --> 00:21:40,459
How about you?

399
00:21:41,694 --> 00:21:42,628
What do you think of me?

400
00:21:45,498 --> 00:21:48,534
How about dating me?

401
00:21:53,072 --> 00:21:54,473
You don't want to?

402
00:22:00,012 --> 00:22:01,380
It's not exactly that.

403
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,582
Then what's making you hesitate?

404
00:22:08,654 --> 00:22:09,588
It's just...

405
00:22:12,825 --> 00:22:13,659
No.

406
00:22:14,727 --> 00:22:16,328
You don't have to answer right now.

407
00:22:17,196 --> 00:22:19,298
Take your time and think it over,

408
00:22:22,368 --> 00:22:23,702
and maybe feel a little pressure too.

409
00:22:36,115 --> 00:22:36,949
What's that?

410
00:22:44,023 --> 00:22:45,691
Should we ride this back home?

411
00:22:52,665 --> 00:22:55,634
I can't believe it.
Sang Gyu is such a macho man.

412
00:22:56,101 --> 00:22:58,504
Hey, come to think of it,

413
00:22:58,504 --> 00:23:00,940
I remembered how Sang Gyu was
always looking out just for you...

414
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,575
back in college.

415
00:23:03,442 --> 00:23:04,510
What's with that face?

416
00:23:04,844 --> 00:23:05,845
Is something wrong?

417
00:23:06,979 --> 00:23:08,113
I don't know.

418
00:23:08,614 --> 00:23:10,282
What do you mean, you don't know?

419
00:23:10,549 --> 00:23:12,017
Don't tell me you don't like Sang Gyu.

420
00:23:14,186 --> 00:23:15,588
It's not like that.

421
00:23:19,058 --> 00:23:20,092
(Eom Jong Do)

422
00:23:20,092 --> 00:23:22,595
Why is this punk calling
in the middle of the night?

423
00:23:22,795 --> 00:23:23,796
Pick up.

424
00:23:25,531 --> 00:23:26,365
What?

425
00:23:26,999 --> 00:23:28,734
Put it on speaker.

426
00:23:31,237 --> 00:23:32,171
Il Ri.

427
00:23:32,538 --> 00:23:34,173
How could you change like that so fast?

428
00:23:34,974 --> 00:23:36,408
Was that really all
our relationship meant to you?

429
00:23:37,443 --> 00:23:38,744
What are you even talking about right now?

430
00:23:39,178 --> 00:23:40,946
I still like you, Il Ri.

431
00:23:42,581 --> 00:23:44,817
I felt like crap
the whole way over to my place.

432
00:23:44,817 --> 00:23:47,086
After I saw that guy last time,
I couldn't even sleep.

433
00:23:47,086 --> 00:23:48,187
I kept wondering why I was like that,

434
00:23:49,722 --> 00:23:51,991
and then I realized.

435
00:23:52,525 --> 00:23:53,659
I'm really sorry,

436
00:23:55,227 --> 00:23:56,629
but I still love you, Il Ri.

437
00:23:59,965 --> 00:24:02,034
I know I've messed up.

438
00:24:02,768 --> 00:24:05,237
But it wasn't that I didn't like you.

439
00:24:05,237 --> 00:24:06,872
I was scared of getting married.

440
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:10,109
I was crushed by the weight of having
to take responsibility for someone,

441
00:24:10,109 --> 00:24:12,745
so I ran away like a coward.

442
00:24:14,013 --> 00:24:15,915
But that happens, right?

443
00:24:15,915 --> 00:24:17,650
People do that sometimes,

444
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:18,517
right?

445
00:24:18,517 --> 00:24:19,752
Sure, it happens.

446
00:24:20,486 --> 00:24:22,888
But a guy who actually does that...

447
00:24:22,888 --> 00:24:24,690
really is a total bastard.

448
00:24:25,658 --> 00:24:26,559
I know.

449
00:24:27,993 --> 00:24:29,061
So I'm sorry.

450
00:24:29,895 --> 00:24:30,863
I'm really sorry.

451
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:33,365
I must've lost my mind for a while.

452
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,634
What are you trying to say?

453
00:24:36,969 --> 00:24:40,039
I'll break up with So Young.
So you break up with that jerk too,

454
00:24:41,807 --> 00:24:43,008
and marry me.

455
00:24:46,812 --> 00:24:49,982
Are you apologizing right now,
or proposing?

456
00:24:49,982 --> 00:24:51,750
Does it bother you that much
that I'm seeing someone?

457
00:24:52,084 --> 00:24:53,986
Enough that you want to stop it
with marriage?

458
00:24:53,986 --> 00:24:55,154
It's because I like you that much.

459
00:24:55,154 --> 00:24:57,089
I'm saying I'll even marry you.

460
00:24:57,089 --> 00:24:57,957
Don't you get it?

461
00:24:58,524 --> 00:24:59,525
So,

462
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,061
let's start over.

463
00:25:03,062 --> 00:25:04,830
I'll really treat you right
this time, okay?

464
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,802
Hey, why'd you hang up?

465
00:25:10,469 --> 00:25:13,339
Hearing that bastard beg like that
is so satisfying.

466
00:25:13,706 --> 00:25:15,574
I don't even need to hear it.

467
00:25:18,777 --> 00:25:21,080
No matter how hard I try to hide my charm,

468
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,748
it just won't stay hidden.

469
00:25:22,748 --> 00:25:25,985
Why can't anyone get over me,
and they keep clinging like this?

470
00:25:25,985 --> 00:25:27,853
Are you bragging right now?

471
00:25:31,357 --> 00:25:32,525
I'm jealous.

472
00:25:33,092 --> 00:25:34,693
Back when I was single,

473
00:25:34,693 --> 00:25:36,996
I had guys flocking to me left and right.

474
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:39,165
Hey.

475
00:25:39,698 --> 00:25:42,434
Don't you think
I've been looking younger lately?

476
00:25:43,602 --> 00:25:44,637
Is it because of this?

477
00:25:44,637 --> 00:25:47,173
Hey! Go easy on that!

478
00:25:47,606 --> 00:25:48,874
You're so stingy.

479
00:25:58,684 --> 00:26:00,352
(Sweet Home Shopping)

480
00:26:05,391 --> 00:26:07,426
Did you hear about Seon Min?

481
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:08,961
Ye Na.

482
00:26:09,995 --> 00:26:11,664
Do you really think it's right
to just stay quiet like this?

483
00:26:12,965 --> 00:26:14,400
Keeping the truth buried any longer.

484
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,502
Don't you think that's way too unfair
to Seon Min?

485
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:20,339
But I only heard it secondhand,

486
00:26:20,339 --> 00:26:22,074
so it doesn't carry any weight
when I say it.

487
00:26:22,074 --> 00:26:22,942
That's why I really hope you...

488
00:26:22,942 --> 00:26:24,143
I told you before.

489
00:26:25,411 --> 00:26:26,412
I...

490
00:26:26,712 --> 00:26:28,581
never had anything like that happen to me.

491
00:26:29,415 --> 00:26:31,917
Why do you keep trying to drag me
into something so filthy?

492
00:26:31,917 --> 00:26:34,019
What on earth did you hear from her?

493
00:26:34,019 --> 00:26:36,021
I get that this puts you
in a tough spot, but...

494
00:26:36,021 --> 00:26:37,156
Who do you think you are, Producer?

495
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:40,960
Were you seriously dating
Seon Min or something?

496
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,996
Or do you just enjoy playing the hero?

497
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:46,765
Why are you trying to meddle
in someone else's life?

498
00:26:46,765 --> 00:26:47,766
Song Ye Na.

499
00:26:50,669 --> 00:26:53,806
Why do you think
Seon Min tried to kill herself?

500
00:26:56,242 --> 00:26:57,309
Maybe Seon Min...

501
00:26:58,010 --> 00:26:59,879
actually wanted to bury all of that...

502
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:02,715
and go back to living like before.

503
00:27:03,249 --> 00:27:04,383
But then,

504
00:27:04,383 --> 00:27:05,951
you stuck your nose in for no reason,

505
00:27:06,485 --> 00:27:09,054
and things blew up beyond repair.

506
00:27:09,421 --> 00:27:11,657
And when you couldn't take responsibility,
you backed out!

507
00:27:12,358 --> 00:27:14,193
How do you think
Seon Min felt at that moment?

508
00:27:16,061 --> 00:27:17,630
In the end, what pushed her that far...

509
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:19,865
wasn't Kim Jeong Sik, but you.

510
00:27:20,299 --> 00:27:21,400
So...

511
00:27:22,268 --> 00:27:23,335
please,

512
00:27:24,637 --> 00:27:26,839
stop pretending to be some good guy
and just stay out of it.

513
00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:41,687
What happened to Seon Min?

514
00:27:41,687 --> 00:27:42,655
How is she?

515
00:27:44,023 --> 00:27:46,659
Her vital signs are back to normal,

516
00:27:47,393 --> 00:27:49,094
but she still won't wake up.

517
00:27:49,094 --> 00:27:50,496
The doctor says it's strange...

518
00:27:51,263 --> 00:27:53,332
and that it seems
like she's refusing to wake up.

519
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,468
I should've asked to see her sooner.

520
00:27:56,468 --> 00:27:58,971
She ignored my calls a few times,

521
00:27:58,971 --> 00:27:59,972
so I just left her alone.

522
00:28:00,873 --> 00:28:03,008
It was awkward for us to reach out too.

523
00:28:03,008 --> 00:28:05,578
We all knew what happened,
but we couldn't really take sides.

524
00:28:05,578 --> 00:28:07,780
But we couldn't
exactly preach at her, either.

525
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:08,681
But...

526
00:28:09,114 --> 00:28:11,951
what could've hurt so much
that she'd take pills?

527
00:28:12,351 --> 00:28:13,485
It's obvious.

528
00:28:13,485 --> 00:28:15,154
Producer Noh probably told her
they should break up.

529
00:28:15,487 --> 00:28:18,657
These days, Na Jeong
and Producer Noh look really close.

530
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,096
Is it really right to keep hiding this
from Na Jeong?

531
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:25,698
Forget it.

532
00:28:25,698 --> 00:28:27,666
Why should we step into
something this messy?

533
00:28:27,666 --> 00:28:29,902
What useless talk
are you two chattering about?

534
00:28:32,972 --> 00:28:34,240
Do you really have that little to do?

535
00:28:35,274 --> 00:28:37,142
You've got that much time...

536
00:28:37,142 --> 00:28:39,111
to gossip about baseless
and pointless rumors?

537
00:28:40,145 --> 00:28:41,347
It's just...

538
00:28:41,347 --> 00:28:42,882
I don't care what it's about.

539
00:28:43,949 --> 00:28:45,985
Don't go around
spreading pointless rumors.

540
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:50,422
Nothing like that
helps the company in any way.

541
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:53,692
Do you want to stir up trouble
just by running your mouth?

542
00:29:00,533 --> 00:29:01,367
Hello.

543
00:29:06,071 --> 00:29:07,239
You scared me.

544
00:29:07,239 --> 00:29:08,707
Why? What's going on?

545
00:29:09,108 --> 00:29:09,975
Hey.

546
00:29:10,409 --> 00:29:12,545
Do you know a woman named Seon Min?

547
00:29:13,145 --> 00:29:14,046
Seon Min?

548
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,282
Yeah, I've seen her.

549
00:29:16,582 --> 00:29:17,917
I heard she couldn't renew contract...

550
00:29:17,917 --> 00:29:20,686
and was having a hard time finding work.

551
00:29:20,986 --> 00:29:21,987
Hey, you idiot.

552
00:29:22,221 --> 00:29:24,423
This is not the time to be so calm.

553
00:29:24,423 --> 00:29:27,159
They say that woman
called Seon Min took pills.

554
00:29:28,194 --> 00:29:30,229
Why? Did something bad happen?

555
00:29:31,463 --> 00:29:33,165
Because of your husband.

556
00:29:33,532 --> 00:29:34,667
My husband?

557
00:29:35,701 --> 00:29:37,236
Tell me everything, in detail.

558
00:29:38,237 --> 00:29:39,572
Because of Producer Noh,

559
00:29:40,339 --> 00:29:42,141
Kim Seon Min took pills?

560
00:29:43,142 --> 00:29:45,477
No, Na Jeong, don't get the wrong idea.

561
00:29:45,477 --> 00:29:48,147
I was just speculating when I said that.

562
00:29:48,147 --> 00:29:49,381
Still,

563
00:29:49,381 --> 00:29:52,551
you must have had some reason
to think that, ma'am.

564
00:29:56,555 --> 00:29:58,090
I'm sorry, Na Jeong.

565
00:29:58,591 --> 00:30:00,359
Actually, for a while now,

566
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:03,629
people have been saying
Producer Noh and Seon Min...

567
00:30:03,629 --> 00:30:04,964
were dating.

568
00:30:05,798 --> 00:30:07,566
I wanted to tell you,

569
00:30:07,566 --> 00:30:10,169
but since we didn't see it ourselves,
it felt wrong to say anything.

570
00:30:24,984 --> 00:30:26,852
Then why did that rumor start?

571
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,788
There must've been something behind it.

572
00:30:30,422 --> 00:30:31,690
Well,

573
00:30:32,591 --> 00:30:35,761
some people saw Seon Min
grabbing onto Producer Noh...

574
00:30:35,761 --> 00:30:37,997
and crying in the conference room.

575
00:30:38,764 --> 00:30:41,333
And people saw them alone together
outside the office...

576
00:30:41,333 --> 00:30:43,035
multiple times.

577
00:30:43,369 --> 00:30:46,739
And a few colleagues said
that on their way out for drinks,

578
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:51,677
they saw Mr. Kim, the head of division,
alone with Producer Noh.

579
00:30:52,645 --> 00:30:57,082
And apparently,
Mr. Kim threw a drink in his face...

580
00:30:57,082 --> 00:30:59,118
and said this.

581
00:30:59,618 --> 00:31:02,288
Don't you feel even a little sorry
for Na Jeong waiting at home?

582
00:31:02,988 --> 00:31:05,024
Watch yourself and behave, you punk.

583
00:31:29,949 --> 00:31:32,284
Don't try to dodge this,
and answer me honestly.

584
00:31:32,985 --> 00:31:35,588
What exactly is going on
between you and this woman, Kim Seon Min?

585
00:31:37,756 --> 00:31:40,025
I don't know what you heard,

586
00:31:40,793 --> 00:31:43,062
but it's not what you think,
so don't get the wrong idea.

587
00:31:43,762 --> 00:31:45,231
Like I told you before,

588
00:31:45,865 --> 00:31:47,299
she lost her job
and couldn't renew her contract,

589
00:31:47,299 --> 00:31:49,535
so I met her a few times
to connect her with people.

590
00:31:50,769 --> 00:31:52,204
I'll explain the details later.

591
00:31:52,638 --> 00:31:54,106
What are you playing at right now?

592
00:31:54,673 --> 00:31:58,210
I saw you with that woman myself,

593
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:01,146
and everyone at work knows
you're having an affair with her.

594
00:32:02,047 --> 00:32:05,384
And yet you don't even think
you owe me an explanation?

595
00:32:06,452 --> 00:32:08,787
Do you seriously want to see me snap?

596
00:32:09,021 --> 00:32:11,090
I am not having an affair.

597
00:32:12,024 --> 00:32:14,193
There's something I can't tell you
that has to do with Seon Min.

598
00:32:14,827 --> 00:32:16,996
It's not something
I can just casually talk about.

599
00:32:17,329 --> 00:32:20,032
Once everything is settled,
I'll tell you everything. Okay?

600
00:32:20,733 --> 00:32:21,734
Yeah.

601
00:32:22,468 --> 00:32:23,502
This is exactly it.

602
00:32:24,537 --> 00:32:26,872
The part of you
that really drives me crazy.

603
00:32:28,474 --> 00:32:31,243
Let's say, for the sake of argument,
that I believe you.

604
00:32:32,611 --> 00:32:33,979
But that's not the issue.

605
00:32:34,513 --> 00:32:36,749
All this time living with you,

606
00:32:37,116 --> 00:32:39,251
this is what's annoyed me the most.

607
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:43,989
That dogmatism of deciding everything
on your own without ever talking to me.

608
00:32:43,989 --> 00:32:45,191
That patriarchal attitude.

609
00:32:46,892 --> 00:32:48,160
Do I look that pathetic to you?

610
00:32:48,561 --> 00:32:49,461
That easy to push around?

611
00:32:50,129 --> 00:32:53,499
If I'd known you were this stubborn
and impossible to talk to,

612
00:32:54,834 --> 00:32:56,535
I never would've married you.

613
00:32:57,503 --> 00:32:59,738
What, are you mad?

614
00:33:00,472 --> 00:33:03,442
You cheated with another woman,
got caught by everyone,

615
00:33:03,442 --> 00:33:05,311
and you can't even explain yourself.

616
00:33:05,644 --> 00:33:06,745
So what exactly are you mad about?

617
00:33:06,745 --> 00:33:08,113
I told you it's not like that.

618
00:33:09,748 --> 00:33:12,751
Do you think I never say anything
because you don't have any flaws?

619
00:33:12,751 --> 00:33:13,953
You don't even look at the bigger picture.

620
00:33:13,953 --> 00:33:15,955
You jump to conclusions and go after
people like you're out to kill a rat.

621
00:33:15,955 --> 00:33:17,756
You treat me like a cheater
without a second thought.

622
00:33:20,259 --> 00:33:22,828
Every time this happens,
I get so sick and tired of it.

623
00:33:23,963 --> 00:33:26,665
Why do you always tear me down
and treat me like a criminal?

624
00:33:29,768 --> 00:33:30,669
You're...

625
00:33:32,137 --> 00:33:33,072
sick of me?

626
00:33:34,507 --> 00:33:35,808
So what you're saying is,

627
00:33:36,509 --> 00:33:39,044
you're fed up and worn out
from living with me, right?

628
00:33:42,748 --> 00:33:44,250
If you're that sick and tired,

629
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:46,085
then let's end it.

630
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,889
As if letting rumors spread
that you're cheating was not enough,

631
00:33:49,889 --> 00:33:52,091
you're dumping the blame on me now.

632
00:33:52,324 --> 00:33:53,626
I don't want to live
with someone like that, either.

633
00:34:57,756 --> 00:34:59,058
Where are you?

634
00:34:59,058 --> 00:35:00,192
Did you actually walk out on the house?

635
00:35:09,235 --> 00:35:10,069
(Won Bin)

636
00:35:10,069 --> 00:35:10,970
Sorry.

637
00:35:11,403 --> 00:35:13,105
I'll be sleeping at the office
for a while.

638
00:35:13,105 --> 00:35:14,306
How can you be like this?

639
00:35:14,673 --> 00:35:16,375
So you really just don't care anymore?

640
00:35:17,042 --> 00:35:19,712
You're basically saying
you have no intention of fixing this.

641
00:35:20,813 --> 00:35:22,248
Fine, forget it.

642
00:35:22,681 --> 00:35:25,518
I don't want to live with someone
as irresponsible as you...

643
00:35:25,518 --> 00:35:26,919
anymore, either.

644
00:35:39,465 --> 00:35:43,802
(Filing for Mutual Divorce)

645
00:35:48,741 --> 00:35:51,110
Please hand me your ID card.

646
00:35:56,482 --> 00:35:58,284
The mutual-consent divorce application,

647
00:35:58,284 --> 00:36:00,452
your family relation certificate,
and marriage certificate.

648
00:36:00,452 --> 00:36:01,487
You brought them, right?

649
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:13,799
As you know, the hearing date
to confirm your intent to divorce...

650
00:36:13,799 --> 00:36:15,601
is set for four weeks from now.

651
00:36:18,404 --> 00:36:20,673
(Seoul Family Court)

652
00:36:31,617 --> 00:36:32,718
Go.

653
00:36:32,718 --> 00:36:33,886
See you on the hearing date.

654
00:36:35,487 --> 00:36:36,422
Wait.

655
00:36:40,059 --> 00:36:42,628
Can we at least grab a coffee
before we go?

656
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:53,806
Say whatever you want to say.

657
00:37:02,147 --> 00:37:03,415
If you've got nothing to say, I'll go.

658
00:37:04,016 --> 00:37:04,884
I'm sorry.

659
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,689
For the way I spoke to you back then.

660
00:37:12,358 --> 00:37:13,492
I've regretted it ever since.

661
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:20,166
You wanted so badly to be a mom,

662
00:37:23,435 --> 00:37:24,737
and I'm so sorry about that too.

663
00:37:29,942 --> 00:37:30,843
It's fine.

664
00:37:32,912 --> 00:37:34,013
Now that it's come to this,

665
00:37:35,181 --> 00:37:36,749
what's the point of saying all that?

666
00:37:39,018 --> 00:37:40,085
When I think about it,

667
00:37:41,954 --> 00:37:44,023
did I really want a baby?

668
00:37:46,225 --> 00:37:48,360
Maybe because our relationship felt
so fragile and unstable,

669
00:37:50,162 --> 00:37:51,797
I just clung to the idea even more.

670
00:37:55,167 --> 00:37:56,468
Maybe it's for the best.

671
00:37:58,304 --> 00:37:59,505
If we'd had a kid,

672
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,374
divorce wouldn't be this easy.

673
00:38:07,746 --> 00:38:09,682
There's still one thing I want to know.

674
00:38:12,117 --> 00:38:13,586
When you married me,

675
00:38:15,421 --> 00:38:17,489
was it really because you loved me?

676
00:38:22,561 --> 00:38:24,263
Then why did you need them?

677
00:38:35,641 --> 00:38:36,509
I'm leaving.

678
00:38:53,192 --> 00:38:55,561
Gu Joo Young, your show was amazing.

679
00:38:55,561 --> 00:38:57,897
I was so moved I almost cried.

680
00:38:57,897 --> 00:39:00,666
Hey, you're supposed to swallow
your emotions, not your snot.

681
00:39:00,666 --> 00:39:01,734
With you sniffling like that,

682
00:39:01,734 --> 00:39:04,103
I could barely focus.

683
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:06,205
- Won Bin.
- Yes?

684
00:39:06,205 --> 00:39:07,673
What do you even like
about someone like her?

685
00:39:08,507 --> 00:39:09,341
Well,

686
00:39:13,946 --> 00:39:14,747
she's just pretty.

687
00:39:17,049 --> 00:39:18,083
I can't even.

688
00:39:18,951 --> 00:39:20,052
Seriously?

689
00:39:20,586 --> 00:39:21,820
Cheers.

690
00:39:22,388 --> 00:39:24,056
- Congrats, Gu Joo Young.
- Congrats!

691
00:39:24,056 --> 00:39:24,957
Hey, Sang Min.

692
00:39:25,558 --> 00:39:26,392
Long time no see.

693
00:39:26,926 --> 00:39:28,627
Won Bin, long time no see.

694
00:39:29,895 --> 00:39:30,696
Who's that?

695
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:32,798
A club friend from college.

696
00:39:34,633 --> 00:39:37,336
It looks like he came alone.
Invite him to join us.

697
00:39:37,336 --> 00:39:38,304
Yes, do that.

698
00:39:38,304 --> 00:39:39,839
Ask him to drink with us.

699
00:39:40,506 --> 00:39:41,507
Okay.

700
00:39:43,042 --> 00:39:43,943
Hey, Sang Min.

701
00:39:44,443 --> 00:39:46,011
If you came alone, come sit with us.

702
00:39:46,011 --> 00:39:47,646
No, I'm fine. Don't mind me.

703
00:39:47,646 --> 00:39:49,682
Hey, get over here and drink with us.

704
00:39:55,254 --> 00:39:57,256
- This is my girlfriend.
- Hello.

705
00:39:57,256 --> 00:39:58,324
And these are her friends.

706
00:39:58,324 --> 00:39:59,925
- Hello.
- Hello.

707
00:39:59,925 --> 00:40:02,628
Sang Min works as an engineer at Naver.

708
00:40:03,596 --> 00:40:04,864
Right? Naver?

709
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:05,731
Yeah.

710
00:40:06,131 --> 00:40:07,399
Great company you work for.

711
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,869
You must be a real talent in IT.

712
00:40:10,102 --> 00:40:11,003
Not really.

713
00:40:11,003 --> 00:40:12,805
- Would you like a drink?
- I don't drink.

714
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:16,876
You don't need to feel awkward.

715
00:40:17,243 --> 00:40:18,978
We're all just as awkward.

716
00:40:38,197 --> 00:40:39,064
Wait.

717
00:40:40,933 --> 00:40:43,469
Honey, aren't those so pretty?

718
00:40:44,203 --> 00:40:45,471
Yeah, they're pretty.

719
00:40:46,872 --> 00:40:49,308
Then can you buy them for my birthday?

720
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:52,077
Nope.

721
00:40:52,411 --> 00:40:53,212
Why not?

722
00:40:54,547 --> 00:40:56,582
They say if you buy someone shoes,
they'll run away.

723
00:40:59,351 --> 00:41:00,619
I don't want you to run away.

724
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,188
What?

725
00:41:03,155 --> 00:41:04,690
If you're not going anywhere,
I'll buy them.

726
00:41:52,071 --> 00:41:55,007
Won Bin didn't come home
last night, either?

727
00:41:56,509 --> 00:41:57,343
He didn't.

728
00:41:57,776 --> 00:42:00,613
That fool.

729
00:42:01,413 --> 00:42:04,049
Breaking his wife's heart like that.

730
00:42:08,687 --> 00:42:09,522
Na Jeong.

731
00:42:10,422 --> 00:42:12,525
Don't be too angry with him, okay?

732
00:42:13,926 --> 00:42:17,496
When people hit their forties,

733
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:19,598
even the nicest ones...

734
00:42:20,065 --> 00:42:22,101
start acting weird...

735
00:42:22,835 --> 00:42:24,837
and can't get their head on straight.

736
00:42:24,837 --> 00:42:27,339
It's part of growing up.

737
00:42:29,008 --> 00:42:31,076
Becoming a real adult isn't easy,
you know.

738
00:42:36,949 --> 00:42:38,017
Father.

739
00:42:38,017 --> 00:42:39,018
Yeah?

740
00:42:39,018 --> 00:42:41,453
You've lived with your wife
for 40 years, right?

741
00:42:42,254 --> 00:42:43,756
Not only 40.

742
00:42:44,223 --> 00:42:45,658
It's been 45.

743
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,796
You must've gone through everything.

744
00:42:52,331 --> 00:42:53,866
How did you make it work?

745
00:42:55,668 --> 00:42:57,336
Don't even get me started.

746
00:42:58,771 --> 00:42:59,738
But...

747
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:03,175
when you go through
all kinds of things together,

748
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:05,778
you start to feel for each other.

749
00:43:07,379 --> 00:43:08,981
Once that tenderness kicks in,

750
00:43:10,249 --> 00:43:12,351
that's the scariest part of all.

751
00:43:46,519 --> 00:43:48,687
(I Am the Best)

752
00:43:50,289 --> 00:43:51,156
Guys.

753
00:43:51,891 --> 00:43:53,325
You doing okay?

754
00:43:59,798 --> 00:44:00,900
Are you so blinded by success...

755
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:03,169
you just threw your pride away?

756
00:44:03,169 --> 00:44:05,504
I told you not to grovel
to trash like her.

757
00:44:26,592 --> 00:44:28,727
Sang Gyu.

758
00:44:28,727 --> 00:44:31,230
You look great in a suit.

759
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:32,364
Right, Il Ri?

760
00:44:32,364 --> 00:44:33,165
Yeah.

761
00:44:33,933 --> 00:44:35,301
Come on, let's go.

762
00:44:38,037 --> 00:44:39,138
Okay.

763
00:44:53,552 --> 00:44:55,421
Ms. Cho, you're here.

764
00:44:56,622 --> 00:44:58,724
Congratulations, Hye Jeong.

765
00:44:58,724 --> 00:45:00,125
You look gorgeous.

766
00:45:00,125 --> 00:45:01,660
Thank you, Na Jeong.

767
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:03,662
When you're broke
and trying to get married,

768
00:45:03,662 --> 00:45:05,698
you've got no choice
but to lean on friends.

769
00:45:06,665 --> 00:45:09,435
I hope I didn't ask for help
when you were too busy.

770
00:45:09,435 --> 00:45:10,903
No, not at all.

771
00:45:10,903 --> 00:45:13,372
But where are the flowers, balloons,
and all the decorations?

772
00:45:13,372 --> 00:45:15,841
- Around that corner over there.
- Okay.

773
00:45:17,209 --> 00:45:18,878
By the way, where are Ms. Lee and Ms. Gu?

774
00:45:18,878 --> 00:45:20,012
They're not here yet.

775
00:45:20,012 --> 00:45:21,747
Don't worry,
we'll finish it together when they come.

776
00:45:24,617 --> 00:45:25,618
You look beautiful.

777
00:45:26,652 --> 00:45:28,420
CEO Choi and Manager Eom.

778
00:45:28,654 --> 00:45:30,122
How are you this early?

779
00:45:30,122 --> 00:45:31,557
It just happened.

780
00:45:32,091 --> 00:45:33,692
But what is all this?

781
00:45:33,692 --> 00:45:35,694
You said it'd be simple,
but it's beautiful.

782
00:45:36,662 --> 00:45:37,930
I'm getting a little annoyed.

783
00:45:40,099 --> 00:45:41,000
Thanks.

784
00:46:22,041 --> 00:46:23,142
Have you been waiting long?

785
00:46:25,211 --> 00:46:26,478
It turns out I'm in early menopause.

786
00:46:28,247 --> 00:46:29,949
What I thought were irregular periods...

787
00:46:29,949 --> 00:46:31,717
was actually early menopause.

788
00:46:32,518 --> 00:46:34,820
So I snapped at you for nothing.

789
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:35,721
You'll just have to understand.

790
00:46:36,822 --> 00:46:39,024
This feels a lot stranger than I expected.

791
00:46:39,024 --> 00:46:41,494
Everyone else has it,
and I'm the only one who doesn't.

792
00:46:42,461 --> 00:46:43,629
It kind of feels like I got cut out.

793
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:49,735
Don't cry yet.
I've got something to confess too.

794
00:46:50,703 --> 00:46:52,071
What is it?

795
00:46:52,905 --> 00:46:54,073
I got divorced.

796
00:46:54,473 --> 00:46:55,374
What?

797
00:46:56,909 --> 00:46:58,277
It's a long story,

798
00:46:58,277 --> 00:47:00,579
but in short, he was a pervert.

799
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:03,215
A creepy pervert who talks to mannequins.

800
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:09,889
Why are you doing this?
You're embarrassing us.

801
00:47:09,889 --> 00:47:10,589
Shush.

802
00:47:11,657 --> 00:47:12,791
Stop.

803
00:47:12,791 --> 00:47:14,827
Sorry.

804
00:47:14,827 --> 00:47:16,762
I'm the terrible one.

805
00:47:17,763 --> 00:47:19,598
Keep your voice down.

806
00:47:23,402 --> 00:47:24,870
What's wrong with you?

807
00:47:37,883 --> 00:47:39,351
What do you think you're doing right now?

808
00:47:39,351 --> 00:47:40,286
Just be honest.

809
00:47:41,287 --> 00:47:42,788
You're not really her boyfriend, are you?

810
00:47:44,056 --> 00:47:46,091
Why do you keep picking fights with me?

811
00:47:46,759 --> 00:47:49,161
Il Ri really hates anything tacky.

812
00:47:50,095 --> 00:47:51,063
And you...

813
00:47:51,931 --> 00:47:54,433
You're just so wrong.

814
00:47:55,134 --> 00:47:55,968
Excuse me.

815
00:47:57,002 --> 00:47:59,305
If you still have feelings for your ex,

816
00:47:59,605 --> 00:48:02,141
shouldn't you apologize properly
and ask her how she feels?

817
00:48:03,042 --> 00:48:05,144
Why scheme behind her back like a coward?

818
00:48:05,611 --> 00:48:06,478
Aren't you ashamed?

819
00:48:08,948 --> 00:48:10,883
Who are you to butt in and lecture me?

820
00:48:11,584 --> 00:48:12,818
Who do you think you are?

821
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,322
What am I supposed to do with this punk?

822
00:48:17,990 --> 00:48:19,892
You didn't want responsibility before,

823
00:48:19,892 --> 00:48:21,527
but now that someone else might take her,
you can't stand it?

824
00:48:21,794 --> 00:48:24,597
Does Il Ri know how pathetic you are?

825
00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:26,031
Pathetic?

826
00:48:27,099 --> 00:48:28,234
I can't even.

827
00:48:30,069 --> 00:48:31,003
Come outside.

828
00:48:35,708 --> 00:48:36,909
She took pills?

829
00:48:38,677 --> 00:48:39,578
Unbelievable.

830
00:48:40,145 --> 00:48:42,715
So the two went and played
Romeo and Juliet?

831
00:48:43,182 --> 00:48:45,117
Like this is some epic tragic love story,

832
00:48:45,117 --> 00:48:47,319
she took pills
and ended up in the hospital,

833
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:49,755
and after all that,

834
00:48:49,755 --> 00:48:51,490
he just walked out with no explanation?

835
00:48:51,490 --> 00:48:53,225
Just divorce him already.

836
00:48:53,726 --> 00:48:55,494
Still, we don't know the whole story.

837
00:48:55,494 --> 00:48:57,329
Jumping straight to divorce feels harsh.

838
00:48:57,730 --> 00:49:00,566
Did you do some huge investigation
before you divorced?

839
00:49:00,566 --> 00:49:02,168
My situation was different.

840
00:49:02,168 --> 00:49:04,870
I caught them myself with my own two eyes.

841
00:49:04,870 --> 00:49:07,406
Na Jeong said
she saw the two of them together too.

842
00:49:08,007 --> 00:49:10,042
Come to think of it, when you said
you were joining the company,

843
00:49:10,042 --> 00:49:11,377
he tried so hard to stop you.

844
00:49:12,278 --> 00:49:14,280
I guess he was scared
he'd get caught having an affair.

845
00:49:16,849 --> 00:49:18,918
How far are you going?
We can talk right here.

846
00:49:20,352 --> 00:49:22,154
Why are we having this conversation
at a wedding hall?

847
00:49:22,454 --> 00:49:23,989
What was that about "pathetic" before?

848
00:49:25,157 --> 00:49:26,025
Say it again.

849
00:49:26,458 --> 00:49:27,226
Hey.

850
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,328
Your guys are fighting.

851
00:49:31,096 --> 00:49:33,332
They've lost it.
What's wrong with them?

852
00:49:34,033 --> 00:49:35,534
Hey, what is happening?

853
00:49:35,534 --> 00:49:37,236
Since when is Sang Gyu Il Ri's man?

854
00:49:37,236 --> 00:49:39,972
He confessed his feelings to her
not long ago.

855
00:49:39,972 --> 00:49:41,707
What? Then what's with Eom Jong Do?

856
00:49:41,707 --> 00:49:43,576
He asked Il Ri to marry him.

857
00:49:43,576 --> 00:49:46,145
Lee Il Ri, why are you so popular?

858
00:49:46,445 --> 00:49:48,647
This stupid popularity
is driving me insane.

859
00:49:48,647 --> 00:49:49,915
Hey.

860
00:49:57,256 --> 00:49:58,357
Stop it already!

861
00:50:02,561 --> 00:50:03,529
Il Ri, be honest.

862
00:50:04,263 --> 00:50:06,165
You're not actually dating
this guy, right?

863
00:50:06,966 --> 00:50:09,168
You're just pretending
so I'll get jealous, right?

864
00:50:10,469 --> 00:50:11,570
Il Ri, you're my girl.

865
00:50:11,904 --> 00:50:13,272
You can't get over me, so why...

866
00:50:13,272 --> 00:50:14,139
No!

867
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:16,475
I like him, not you.

868
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:18,511
We already slept together.

869
00:50:21,213 --> 00:50:22,047
Liar.

870
00:50:23,148 --> 00:50:24,517
You're lying, right?

871
00:50:24,517 --> 00:50:25,484
I'm not lying.

872
00:50:26,252 --> 00:50:28,487
I don't have any feelings left for you.

873
00:50:28,487 --> 00:50:29,321
Il Ri.

874
00:50:30,456 --> 00:50:32,424
Until recently, you wanted to marry me.

875
00:50:32,758 --> 00:50:33,926
Yeah, I did.

876
00:50:34,593 --> 00:50:36,128
I pretended I didn't, but I did.

877
00:50:36,595 --> 00:50:38,898
But the moment you asked me to marry you,

878
00:50:38,898 --> 00:50:39,932
everything became clear.

879
00:50:40,966 --> 00:50:42,368
The person I want to marry...

880
00:50:42,368 --> 00:50:44,069
isn't you. It's him.

881
00:50:47,206 --> 00:50:48,474
They're getting married?

882
00:50:48,474 --> 00:50:50,009
Even if I hadn't screwed up,

883
00:50:51,477 --> 00:50:52,611
woul you still have dated him?

884
00:50:53,412 --> 00:50:54,380
Yeah.

885
00:50:55,481 --> 00:50:56,549
I think I would have.

886
00:50:57,983 --> 00:51:00,886
Then I would've been the one cheating,
not you.

887
00:51:05,124 --> 00:51:06,158
Do you get it now?

888
00:51:06,892 --> 00:51:09,762
You and I are really over.

889
00:51:10,830 --> 00:51:13,265
So let go and live your life.

890
00:51:26,645 --> 00:51:28,180
What now? What's going on?

891
00:51:37,056 --> 00:51:39,291
Hey, why are you dumping your confession
on someone else?

892
00:51:39,291 --> 00:51:40,192
Wait!

893
00:51:40,192 --> 00:51:41,293
Don't come any closer.

894
00:51:46,866 --> 00:51:48,033
The truth is, I...

895
00:51:49,568 --> 00:51:50,503
actually...

896
00:51:55,241 --> 00:51:56,075
I can't have...

897
00:52:00,179 --> 00:52:02,281
Can we take things a little slower?

898
00:52:03,215 --> 00:52:05,584
I'm sorry,
but I'm still not sure about you.

899
00:52:06,719 --> 00:52:07,720
Well,

900
00:52:08,521 --> 00:52:10,022
no matter how old we are,

901
00:52:10,022 --> 00:52:12,057
we should move forward step by step...

902
00:52:12,758 --> 00:52:15,227
while we're seeing
if we're really right for each other.

903
00:52:16,228 --> 00:52:18,430
Isn't that how it's supposed to be?

904
00:52:20,666 --> 00:52:22,401
That's how I see it.

905
00:52:23,269 --> 00:52:24,603
You're right.

906
00:52:25,237 --> 00:52:27,640
But we already, you know...

907
00:52:30,442 --> 00:52:32,711
Yeah, you're right.

908
00:52:37,850 --> 00:52:40,119
I can't even.

909
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:42,955
They say the quiet cat
is the first to jump on the stove...

910
00:52:42,955 --> 00:52:46,125
Hey, say it right. She's not a quiet cat.

911
00:52:47,092 --> 00:52:48,727
True.

912
00:52:48,727 --> 00:52:50,563
She's a wild, delinquent cat.

913
00:52:52,665 --> 00:52:54,900
But did you also not know
that they slept together?

914
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:55,768
I had no idea.

915
00:52:57,603 --> 00:53:00,005
The more I think about it,
the more upsetting this is.

916
00:53:00,005 --> 00:53:01,607
We tell her everything,

917
00:53:01,607 --> 00:53:02,908
but she keeps things from us.

918
00:53:04,109 --> 00:53:05,444
Because it was Sang Gyu.

919
00:53:06,512 --> 00:53:09,048
To us, Sang Gyu is pretty much family.

920
00:53:12,017 --> 00:53:13,185
Yeah.

921
00:53:13,185 --> 00:53:16,355
There are things you can't say
because they're family.

922
00:53:23,496 --> 00:53:25,431
Hey, then...

923
00:53:26,699 --> 00:53:28,767
about your husband and my husband.

924
00:53:29,535 --> 00:53:32,471
Maybe there's something
they couldn't tell us...

925
00:53:32,471 --> 00:53:35,174
for that same reason.
Because we're family.

926
00:53:37,576 --> 00:53:38,577
You're right.

927
00:53:39,979 --> 00:53:41,814
A line from a drama
just popped into my head.

928
00:53:42,715 --> 00:53:43,549
What?

929
00:53:44,149 --> 00:53:46,285
"Even if everyone else knew,

930
00:53:46,285 --> 00:53:48,120
I just hoped my family wouldn't."

931
00:54:05,204 --> 00:54:07,740
Hello, Mr. Kim.
This is Cho Na Jeong.

932
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:10,943
If you have a moment,
could I see you for a bit?

933
00:54:18,651 --> 00:54:20,819
I'm sorry to bother you
when you're off the clock.

934
00:54:23,689 --> 00:54:25,057
I'm the head of division.

935
00:54:25,591 --> 00:54:27,326
I should've been the one to ask you first.
Sorry about that.

936
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:30,296
How's your internship going?

937
00:54:31,831 --> 00:54:32,932
Anything giving you trouble?

938
00:54:33,866 --> 00:54:35,067
It's not that.

939
00:54:36,035 --> 00:54:38,504
There's just one thing I wanted to ask.

940
00:54:38,504 --> 00:54:39,505
What is it?

941
00:54:40,873 --> 00:54:42,408
I heard that Producer Noh Won Bin...

942
00:54:43,576 --> 00:54:45,911
and former show host Kim Seon Min,
who left,

943
00:54:46,278 --> 00:54:49,114
were in an inappropriate relationship.

944
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:52,318
Is that true?

945
00:54:53,018 --> 00:54:54,520
Why ask me that?

946
00:54:55,387 --> 00:54:56,822
I heard that because of it,

947
00:54:56,822 --> 00:54:59,391
you called Producer Noh in
and gave him a scolding.

948
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:02,161
That.

949
00:55:04,630 --> 00:55:07,900
When that ridiculous rumor
started going around the company,

950
00:55:08,634 --> 00:55:10,936
I called him in and told him
to watch his behavior.

951
00:55:10,936 --> 00:55:11,937
I just gave him a talking-to, that's all.

952
00:55:12,805 --> 00:55:14,406
I don't really know the details, either.

953
00:55:20,246 --> 00:55:22,548
When I heard those rumors,

954
00:55:23,749 --> 00:55:25,417
you were the first person
who came to mind.

955
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:27,219
You know I was really fond of you.

956
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:29,855
I thought about how crushed you must be.

957
00:55:30,489 --> 00:55:33,359
So I scolded him...

958
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:35,060
like an older brother would.

959
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:37,963
So you only heard it as a rumor too, then?

960
00:55:39,064 --> 00:55:39,932
Yeah.

961
00:55:40,399 --> 00:55:43,102
Did you call in show host Kim Seon Min
and ask her as well?

962
00:55:45,905 --> 00:55:47,006
Well,

963
00:55:47,006 --> 00:55:50,276
by then, Seon Min had already resigned.

964
00:55:50,276 --> 00:55:52,011
And usually, in situations like that,

965
00:55:52,478 --> 00:55:55,648
people assume the married man
is more at fault, not the single woman.

966
00:56:22,208 --> 00:56:23,876
Seon Young, it's me.

967
00:56:24,476 --> 00:56:27,746
Do you happen to know
which hospital Kim Seon Min is in?

968
00:56:40,025 --> 00:56:41,494
(Wishing you a speedy recovery,
Kim * Min)

969
00:56:53,072 --> 00:56:53,906
I'm sorry.

970
00:56:54,907 --> 00:56:55,841
Seon Min.

971
00:56:58,944 --> 00:57:00,646
I know you wouldn't want me here,

972
00:57:01,847 --> 00:57:02,882
but I came anyway.

973
00:57:04,683 --> 00:57:05,885
If I don't see you,

974
00:57:07,253 --> 00:57:09,255
I don't think I'll be able to sleep.

975
00:57:11,590 --> 00:57:13,025
You resented me a lot, didn't you?

976
00:57:16,295 --> 00:57:17,329
I'm sorry.

977
00:57:17,830 --> 00:57:19,598
But I was so scared.

978
00:57:20,366 --> 00:57:22,434
I was scared I'd be blacklisted
in the industry.

979
00:57:25,804 --> 00:57:29,441
Still, why did you have to take pills?

980
00:57:30,543 --> 00:57:33,312
How am I supposed to live
with this guilt now?

981
00:57:37,883 --> 00:57:39,185
Ye Na, what do you mean by that?

982
00:57:39,985 --> 00:57:40,819
Na Jeong.

983
00:57:41,387 --> 00:57:43,088
Why are you here?

984
00:57:43,722 --> 00:57:46,058
What did you mean by what you just said?

985
00:57:47,426 --> 00:57:48,460
It's nothing.

986
00:57:50,396 --> 00:57:51,764
Don't lie to me.

987
00:57:51,764 --> 00:57:53,399
You clearly know what's going on.

988
00:57:53,632 --> 00:57:56,569
Explain to me
why Seon Min took those pills.

989
00:58:00,439 --> 00:58:01,407
Ye Na.

990
00:58:02,074 --> 00:58:03,075
Ye Na.

991
00:58:17,122 --> 00:58:20,626
I report sexual harassment
by K, the Head of Division,

992
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:22,261
at Sweet Home Shopping.

993
00:58:24,663 --> 00:58:25,397
(Yang Mi Sook)

994
00:58:27,299 --> 00:58:28,267
Mi Sook.

995
00:58:28,267 --> 00:58:30,436
Hey, did you see the screenshot
I sent you?

996
00:58:31,136 --> 00:58:32,371
What is this?

997
00:58:32,371 --> 00:58:35,474
I had a feeling
Kim Seon Min and your husband...

998
00:58:35,474 --> 00:58:38,777
had something shady going on,
so I sounded out Assistant Manager Ha.

999
00:58:38,777 --> 00:58:39,678
Assistant Manager Ha?

1000
00:58:40,012 --> 00:58:41,413
Who's that?

1001
00:58:41,413 --> 00:58:42,515
Didn't I tell you?

1002
00:58:42,515 --> 00:58:44,316
Someone on the company's legal team
who's been tagging along with me lately.

1003
00:58:45,384 --> 00:58:46,218
And?

1004
00:58:46,785 --> 00:58:50,356
But the guy kept insisting
he didn't know a thing...

1005
00:58:50,356 --> 00:58:51,957
and wouldn't talk no matter what.

1006
00:58:52,291 --> 00:58:54,827
So while he stepped into the bathroom
for a minute,

1007
00:58:55,127 --> 00:58:56,962
I secretly went through his phone,

1008
00:58:56,962 --> 00:58:58,230
and that's what I found.

1009
00:58:58,998 --> 00:59:00,199
So from that,

1010
00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:02,968
it looks like it wasn't your husband
she had an affair with,

1011
00:59:03,435 --> 00:59:04,837
but that rat-faced division head...

1012
00:59:04,837 --> 00:59:07,006
she got tangled up with.

1013
00:59:08,908 --> 00:59:10,109
The way I see it,

1014
00:59:10,509 --> 00:59:13,479
your husband was just trying
to help his junior...

1015
00:59:13,479 --> 00:59:14,813
and ended up cornered.

1016
00:59:16,115 --> 00:59:18,017
Since it involved the higher-ups,

1017
00:59:18,017 --> 00:59:19,919
if he said something reckless,

1018
00:59:19,919 --> 00:59:21,587
he probably thought
he'd get his head chopped off.

1019
00:59:22,521 --> 00:59:25,357
That's probably why
he couldn't explain himself to anyone.

1020
00:59:26,692 --> 00:59:29,862
Don't I sound like a detective?

1021
00:59:41,807 --> 00:59:43,409
And usually, in situations like that,

1022
00:59:43,909 --> 00:59:47,079
people assume the married man
is more at fault, not the single woman.

1023
01:00:12,171 --> 01:00:13,873
It was really tough.

1024
01:00:15,174 --> 01:00:16,675
Seriously.

1025
01:00:16,675 --> 01:00:19,278
Well, look at our lovely show hosts.

1026
01:00:20,212 --> 01:00:21,680
What's got you all smiles?

1027
01:00:23,282 --> 01:00:27,219
We were just swapping
some scary stories from work.

1028
01:00:27,219 --> 01:00:28,754
I'd love to hear those too.

1029
01:00:29,522 --> 01:00:31,557
I'll set up a team dinner soon, okay?

1030
01:00:33,025 --> 01:00:34,527
- Good work, then.
- Yes.

1031
01:00:39,532 --> 01:00:42,835
But the way he looks at us...

1032
01:00:42,835 --> 01:00:44,703
is kind of unsettling.

1033
01:00:44,703 --> 01:00:46,238
Is it just me who thinks that?

1034
01:00:46,238 --> 01:00:48,374
You too?
Honestly, me too.

1035
01:00:49,808 --> 01:00:53,913
He's just a nice, playful guy.

1036
01:00:53,913 --> 01:00:56,282
If you nitpick all that,
how are you going to survive at work?

1037
01:00:56,715 --> 01:00:58,484
Come on, let's drink and head back in.

1038
01:01:11,931 --> 01:01:12,865
What are you doing here?

1039
01:01:17,870 --> 01:01:19,538
You reek of alcohol.

1040
01:01:19,538 --> 01:01:21,106
Why did you drink so much?

1041
01:01:23,609 --> 01:01:26,846
That habit you have of deciding everything
on your own without talking to me.

1042
01:01:26,846 --> 01:01:28,280
That patriarchal attitude.

1043
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:29,582
Do I look that pathetic to you?

1044
01:01:30,015 --> 01:01:30,883
That easy to push around?

1045
01:01:31,717 --> 01:01:35,020
If I'd known you were this stubborn
and impossible to talk to,

1046
01:01:36,388 --> 01:01:38,057
I never would've married you.

1047
01:02:12,791 --> 01:02:15,728
(Min Woo, Min Jun's Mom)

1048
01:02:25,204 --> 01:02:27,373
Honey, I'm sorry.

1049
01:02:31,744 --> 01:02:33,279
You're still...

1050
01:02:33,646 --> 01:02:35,915
the man I'd most want to be married to.

1051
01:03:00,906 --> 01:03:01,807
About everything,

1052
01:03:02,908 --> 01:03:04,743
I'm sorry I couldn't explain it properly.

1053
01:03:07,313 --> 01:03:08,380
Seon Min...

1054
01:03:09,315 --> 01:03:11,951
came to me saying
there was no one else she could trust.

1055
01:03:13,786 --> 01:03:15,788
You and the kids kept coming to mind,

1056
01:03:16,755 --> 01:03:19,091
but I just couldn't bring myself
to turn her away.

1057
01:03:20,125 --> 01:03:21,927
And in the end,
I ended up flagged at work.

1058
01:03:23,829 --> 01:03:26,899
In the middle of all that,
you said you were joining the company.

1059
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,269
And I really didn't want...

1060
01:03:31,103 --> 01:03:33,038
you to see just how pathetic I'd been.

1061
01:03:37,943 --> 01:03:38,844
Me too.

1062
01:03:39,612 --> 01:03:41,847
I'm sorry for doubting you first
without knowing the full story.

1063
01:03:44,450 --> 01:03:47,386
I should've trusted my own husband.

1064
01:03:48,988 --> 01:03:50,623
But once I learned what really happened,

1065
01:03:52,791 --> 01:03:54,793
it brought something back to me.

1066
01:03:57,630 --> 01:03:58,664
You've always been...

1067
01:03:59,932 --> 01:04:01,367
the kind of person...

1068
01:04:01,367 --> 01:04:03,369
who can't just walk past
someone powerless.

1069
01:04:05,271 --> 01:04:07,239
For someone like you to go through this,

1070
01:04:08,007 --> 01:04:09,842
it must have eaten you up inside.

1071
01:04:11,844 --> 01:04:13,579
It must have been hard carrying it alone.

1072
01:04:15,014 --> 01:04:16,549
You had to protect your family,

1073
01:04:17,883 --> 01:04:20,586
and still protect your conscience
in a mess like that.

1074
01:04:23,022 --> 01:04:24,790
You must have been really torn up inside.

1075
01:04:29,028 --> 01:04:30,029
But honey,

1076
01:04:33,132 --> 01:04:34,700
what happened to Seon Min...

1077
01:04:36,001 --> 01:04:37,236
is not on you.

1078
01:04:39,238 --> 01:04:40,272
Don't beat yourself up.

1079
01:04:45,544 --> 01:04:46,512
Thank you.

1080
01:04:47,413 --> 01:04:48,247
Na Jeong.

1081
01:04:55,154 --> 01:04:56,956
Hello,
I'm show host Kim Gwan Woo.

1082
01:04:56,956 --> 01:04:58,924
Joining you today,
I'm show host Yoon Chae Ryeong.

1083
01:04:58,924 --> 01:05:02,561
Everyone, did you brush your teeth
after your late-night snack yesterday?

1084
01:05:02,561 --> 01:05:06,432
We brush our teeth
three times a day out of habit, right?

1085
01:05:06,432 --> 01:05:07,666
- But did you know this?
- Know what?

1086
01:05:07,666 --> 01:05:10,603
If you brush halfheartedly,
all the plaque that's built up all day...

1087
01:05:10,603 --> 01:05:12,638
just stays right there.

1088
01:05:12,638 --> 01:05:14,006
But with our Denden Brush...

1089
01:05:14,006 --> 01:05:15,074
But that night,

1090
01:05:15,774 --> 01:05:18,177
I could barely sleep.

1091
01:05:24,817 --> 01:05:27,086
I understood
my husband's feelings all too well,

1092
01:05:29,255 --> 01:05:30,823
but if we brought the truth to light,

1093
01:05:31,323 --> 01:05:34,527
we'd both have to be ready
to lose our jobs.

1094
01:05:36,295 --> 01:05:37,796
And for our family,

1095
01:05:38,330 --> 01:05:40,499
that was just too big a risk to take.

1096
01:05:46,605 --> 01:05:48,340
Honey, why aren't you sleeping?

1097
01:05:51,877 --> 01:05:53,045
Just.

1098
01:05:55,915 --> 01:05:57,816
What's wrong? You can't sleep?

1099
01:06:00,085 --> 01:06:01,287
Honey, listen.

1100
01:06:02,021 --> 01:06:04,757
I have a favor to ask.

1101
01:06:11,831 --> 01:06:12,898
Why don't we...

1102
01:06:14,633 --> 01:06:15,734
just...

1103
01:06:16,969 --> 01:06:17,870
pretend we don't know anything
about Seon Min?

1104
01:06:22,942 --> 01:06:24,643
I know exactly
how much this is eating you up.

1105
01:06:24,643 --> 01:06:25,945
I really do.

1106
01:06:26,645 --> 01:06:27,580
But...

1107
01:06:28,113 --> 01:06:30,482
you know what it meant to me
to join this company.

1108
01:06:31,684 --> 01:06:33,118
You know that too.

1109
01:06:34,386 --> 01:06:35,721
And more than anything,

1110
01:06:37,089 --> 01:06:38,991
we're Min Woo and Min Jun's parents.

1111
01:06:40,893 --> 01:06:42,928
As much as it hurts
to see someone treated unfairly,

1112
01:06:43,696 --> 01:06:47,032
keeping our family safe
matters more to me.

1113
01:06:48,267 --> 01:06:49,235
So...

1114
01:06:51,437 --> 01:06:52,805
for our family,

1115
01:06:55,908 --> 01:06:57,042
can we just...

1116
01:06:59,011 --> 01:07:00,412
step away from this?

1117
01:08:07,546 --> 01:08:09,682
(Don't call me ma'am)

1118
01:08:10,049 --> 01:08:11,650
What's the rumor going around right now?

1119
01:08:12,785 --> 01:08:13,853
You...

1120
01:08:13,853 --> 01:08:17,122
pushed Won Bin to report
the head of division...

1121
01:08:17,556 --> 01:08:18,824
to the ethics committee, didn't you?

1122
01:08:19,925 --> 01:08:21,494
Let me be blunt.

1123
01:08:21,827 --> 01:08:24,396
If you didn't have
that creepy little hobby of yours,

1124
01:08:24,396 --> 01:08:26,165
do you really think
things would've gone this far?

1125
01:08:26,165 --> 01:08:27,766
Who are you calling a pervert right now?

1126
01:08:27,766 --> 01:08:30,102
- Mom, stop.
- You should speak up if you're wronged.

1127
01:08:30,102 --> 01:08:31,437
When you get married,

1128
01:08:32,004 --> 01:08:33,472
do you want to have kids?

1129
01:08:34,006 --> 01:08:34,907
Wait.

1130
01:08:35,508 --> 01:08:38,310
Let's stay friends as working moms...

1131
01:08:38,877 --> 01:08:40,111
for a long, long time.

1132
01:08:40,112 --> 01:08:41,447
Why are you trying
to slap this kind of label on me?

1133
01:08:41,447 --> 01:08:43,349
What grudge do you have against me?

1134
01:08:43,749 --> 01:08:47,019
Did you order this, Executive Director?
