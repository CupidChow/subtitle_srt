6
00:00:50,607 --> 00:00:51,842
- Good work today.
- You worked really hard today.

7
00:00:51,842 --> 00:00:52,943
You too.

8
00:00:52,943 --> 00:00:53,877
- Bye.
- Bye.

9
00:00:55,946 --> 00:00:56,913
Mom.

10
00:00:57,547 --> 00:00:58,415
Hey.

11
00:00:58,882 --> 00:01:01,885
Why didn't you tell me
you were going to be on air?

12
00:01:01,885 --> 00:01:03,887
I almost missed it.

13
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:07,224
You saw me on TV?

14
00:01:07,858 --> 00:01:08,825
Of course, I did.

15
00:01:09,826 --> 00:01:12,996
Seeing you on TV
for the first time in a while...

16
00:01:12,996 --> 00:01:14,298
made me so happy.

17
00:01:16,099 --> 00:01:18,902
It must've been so hard
hiding that talent all this time.

18
00:01:21,204 --> 00:01:21,905
Mom.

19
00:01:21,905 --> 00:01:25,175
I'm going to be on TV all the time
from now on, so don't miss my shows.

20
00:01:26,977 --> 00:01:30,080
And I did so well today...

21
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,349
that the executive director said
I should just go straight on air.

22
00:01:32,816 --> 00:01:33,784
Really?

23
00:01:34,751 --> 00:01:36,353
That's my girl.

24
00:01:37,154 --> 00:01:39,289
Look at you. You're so sharp.
I wonder who you got that from.

25
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:44,094
Producer Noh.

26
00:01:45,862 --> 00:01:47,664
You don't want Na Jeong
to stay at Sweet Home Shopping, do you?

27
00:01:48,432 --> 00:01:49,633
Can you make her leave?

28
00:01:50,367 --> 00:01:51,268
What?

29
00:01:52,436 --> 00:01:53,670
I knew it.

30
00:01:54,104 --> 00:01:57,808
That's why I practically begged you
not to let Na Jeong in...

31
00:01:57,808 --> 00:01:59,576
no matter what.

32
00:01:59,576 --> 00:02:01,979
Why did you ignore that?

33
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:03,747
Are you saying you got hurt
because of Na Jeong?

34
00:02:03,747 --> 00:02:05,182
That's exactly right.

35
00:02:05,182 --> 00:02:07,317
If she hadn't pushed for outdoor filming,

36
00:02:07,317 --> 00:02:09,152
this wouldn't have happened to me.

37
00:02:09,886 --> 00:02:10,787
So?

38
00:02:11,121 --> 00:02:14,491
I really can't work with Na Jeong anymore.

39
00:02:15,392 --> 00:02:17,928
Can't you at least talk to her now...

40
00:02:17,928 --> 00:02:19,663
and tell her to quit?

41
00:02:19,663 --> 00:02:20,530
What?

42
00:02:20,831 --> 00:02:22,799
Come on, let's be honest.

43
00:02:22,799 --> 00:02:24,301
You don't want Na Jeong to find out...

44
00:02:24,301 --> 00:02:27,704
you got on everyone's bad side at work
because of Seon Min,

45
00:02:27,704 --> 00:02:28,872
and I'm so uncomfortable
around her too, so...

46
00:02:28,872 --> 00:02:29,806
Song Ye Na.

47
00:02:30,974 --> 00:02:33,210
Do you think I'm a pushover
just because I kept my mouth shut?

48
00:02:33,677 --> 00:02:35,178
What happened with Seon Min is one thing,

49
00:02:35,412 --> 00:02:36,847
but you talking recklessly
about Na Jeong...

50
00:02:36,847 --> 00:02:38,048
is crossing the line.

51
00:02:42,252 --> 00:02:44,354
You really don't budge.

52
00:02:44,354 --> 00:02:46,690
I'm just trying to have
a nice dinner with you after a long time.

53
00:02:47,224 --> 00:02:48,091
What about Ye Eun?

54
00:02:48,892 --> 00:02:50,427
Did she say what time she'd be home?

55
00:03:00,904 --> 00:03:03,006
It's been ages
since I had dinner with my girl too.

56
00:03:21,358 --> 00:03:24,161
Hey, you guys, long time no see.

57
00:03:24,161 --> 00:03:25,829
I told you not to touch that.

58
00:03:31,401 --> 00:03:32,369
You startled me.

59
00:03:38,809 --> 00:03:41,345
Isn't this totally unfair?

60
00:03:41,712 --> 00:03:42,980
We're all interns,

61
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,916
so how come she gets to go on air
while others only get to observe?

62
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:47,050
Exactly.

63
00:03:47,351 --> 00:03:50,320
And not even as a co-host,
but a main host?

64
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,322
I heard the main host got stung by a bee,

65
00:03:52,322 --> 00:03:53,557
so she jumped in
as a last-minute replacement.

66
00:03:54,324 --> 00:03:55,425
Stung by a bee?

67
00:03:56,026 --> 00:03:56,893
I can't even.

68
00:03:57,561 --> 00:03:59,796
I guess it's true what they say.

69
00:03:59,796 --> 00:04:00,998
Luck follows some people wherever they go.

70
00:04:03,934 --> 00:04:05,168
Good morning.

71
00:04:06,503 --> 00:04:08,138
It's a good morning only for you.

72
00:04:09,873 --> 00:04:12,276
Let's go grab a coffee.

73
00:04:12,276 --> 00:04:13,143
That sounds good.

Why am I not on this?

78
00:04:44,207 --> 00:04:46,043
Well,

79
00:04:47,244 --> 00:04:49,212
I suggested putting you in as a co-host
in the next lineup,

80
00:04:49,212 --> 00:04:52,282
but Ye Na said she thinks
it's still a bit early for you,

81
00:04:52,282 --> 00:04:53,650
and asked me to put it on hold.

82
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:56,320
You know it's already a sensitive issue
in terms of fairness,

83
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,155
and when even your mentor's against it,

84
00:04:59,022 --> 00:05:00,190
I don't really have any grounds.

85
00:05:01,892 --> 00:05:02,726
Okay.

86
00:05:10,067 --> 00:05:11,368
Excuse me.

87
00:05:11,368 --> 00:05:12,502
Have you seen Song Ye Na?

88
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,638
I think she's resting in the waiting room.

89
00:05:14,638 --> 00:05:15,706
Thanks.

90
00:05:20,677 --> 00:05:22,045
What do you think you're doing?

91
00:05:22,045 --> 00:05:23,547
That's what I want to ask.

92
00:05:23,547 --> 00:05:25,382
I rushed you to the ER
when you were about to pass out,

93
00:05:25,382 --> 00:05:27,184
covered for the broadcast
so it wouldn't fall apart,

94
00:05:27,184 --> 00:05:28,752
and this is how you pay me back?

95
00:05:28,752 --> 00:05:30,087
How could you do that?

96
00:05:31,355 --> 00:05:33,290
I can't believe that's how you view it.

97
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:34,491
Look at you.

98
00:05:34,491 --> 00:05:36,793
From where I'm standing,

99
00:05:36,793 --> 00:05:38,562
it looks like you climbed up
by stepping on me in the gutter.

100
00:05:41,431 --> 00:05:43,667
You know what? Let's just forget it.

101
00:05:43,667 --> 00:05:45,702
How am I supposed to deal
with someone like you...

102
00:05:45,702 --> 00:05:46,837
who twists everything I say and do?

103
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,105
Whatever.

104
00:05:48,105 --> 00:05:50,507
From now on, whether you're drowning
in the gutter or on your last breath,

105
00:05:50,941 --> 00:05:52,209
I am never helping you again.

106
00:05:52,476 --> 00:05:55,112
The day I help you again,
I'm not even a person.

107
00:06:12,362 --> 00:06:14,131
Damn it. I'm so mad.

108
00:06:14,131 --> 00:06:15,599
What did I do in a past life...

109
00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:18,335
for her to pick on me
over every little thing?

110
00:06:18,335 --> 00:06:20,737
Still, I did save her, didn't I?

111
00:06:20,737 --> 00:06:23,273
You knew she was a rude brat.

112
00:06:23,774 --> 00:06:26,677
I knew, but I didn't know it was this bad.

113
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:27,911
What else can you do?

114
00:06:27,911 --> 00:06:30,747
Just coax her however you can
so she doesn't pull anything big.

115
00:06:31,281 --> 00:06:32,482
No.

116
00:06:32,482 --> 00:06:34,985
I've dealt with plenty
of people like that.

117
00:06:34,985 --> 00:06:36,420
With petty people like her,

118
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:39,056
if you push back hard, they usually fold.

119
00:06:39,056 --> 00:06:41,391
So what about a head-on approach?

120
00:06:41,391 --> 00:06:42,593
Like what?

121
00:06:42,593 --> 00:06:45,729
Just report her for workplace harassment.

122
00:06:46,063 --> 00:06:46,763
What?

123
00:06:46,763 --> 00:06:50,000
No, that's way too risky.

124
00:06:50,267 --> 00:06:51,301
What's risky about it?

125
00:06:51,301 --> 00:06:52,469
If things stay like this,

126
00:06:52,469 --> 00:06:55,172
she won't get good evaluations anyway,
and she's bound to get fired.

127
00:06:55,172 --> 00:06:57,507
You might as well go head-on.

128
00:06:57,507 --> 00:06:59,176
Don't be ridiculous.

129
00:06:59,643 --> 00:07:02,446
No matter what, Ye Na's an employee,
and she's just an intern.

130
00:07:02,446 --> 00:07:03,380
Report her?

131
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,448
Easier said than done.

132
00:07:04,848 --> 00:07:06,617
Who do you think
the company will side with?

133
00:07:07,117 --> 00:07:08,719
Who do you think will take the fall?

134
00:07:09,553 --> 00:07:10,454
Then what am I supposed to do?

135
00:07:11,054 --> 00:07:13,824
Figure out a way to win her over instead.

136
00:07:14,558 --> 00:07:17,661
Hey, technically speaking,
aren't you a saleswoman?

137
00:07:17,961 --> 00:07:20,464
You reel in viewers who don't even care,
but you can't win her over?

138
00:07:21,298 --> 00:07:22,099
True.

139
00:07:23,433 --> 00:07:26,336
Right, did you go to the OB-GYN?

140
00:07:27,938 --> 00:07:29,172
Yeah.

141
00:07:29,473 --> 00:07:30,874
They said my periods are irregular.

142
00:07:32,509 --> 00:07:34,177
I knew it.

143
00:07:34,177 --> 00:07:37,247
You're up all night, drinking like crazy,
and running yourself ragged.

144
00:07:37,247 --> 00:07:39,783
Hey, we really need
to stop wrecking ourselves.

145
00:07:39,783 --> 00:07:41,752
If you burn yourself out
when you're young,

146
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:43,887
your body gets its revenge
when you're older.

147
00:07:43,887 --> 00:07:45,889
Okay, okay.

148
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:50,727
What do I do with her? I'm so pissed.

149
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:54,932
Where did the driver say they are now?

150
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:57,834
About five minutes out.

151
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,541
Are you not going
to tell Na Jeong about it?

152
00:08:05,442 --> 00:08:06,777
It's nothing, really.

153
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:09,012
She'll just worry and make a big scene.

154
00:08:10,847 --> 00:08:14,084
What about freezing your eggs?

155
00:08:14,584 --> 00:08:16,954
What for?
I have no plans on having kids anyway.

156
00:08:17,654 --> 00:08:18,622
Still.

157
00:08:19,289 --> 00:08:22,125
Someday, if you meet someone
you really love,

158
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:23,594
you might change your mind.

159
00:08:27,197 --> 00:08:29,099
Egg freezing?

160
00:08:32,102 --> 00:08:36,406
Well, it's not completely impossible,

161
00:08:37,874 --> 00:08:40,677
but you might go through all that
and not get much out of it.

162
00:08:41,545 --> 00:08:44,281
We usually need to retrieve
around 20 follicles...

163
00:08:44,281 --> 00:08:47,084
to get one or two good ones.

164
00:08:48,151 --> 00:08:50,320
But in your case, Ms. Lee,

165
00:08:50,721 --> 00:08:53,357
even producing follicles is not easy.

166
00:08:57,995 --> 00:08:59,963
That's enough.
Don't make a big deal out of this.

167
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:21,952
Hey.

168
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,521
Hey.

169
00:09:26,757 --> 00:09:27,925
Go wash up and rest.

170
00:09:33,263 --> 00:09:34,264
Honey, did you drink?

171
00:09:36,667 --> 00:09:37,567
Yeah.

172
00:09:40,103 --> 00:09:40,904
Are you happy?

173
00:09:41,405 --> 00:09:42,272
What?

174
00:09:43,006 --> 00:09:45,676
Are you happy because I don't ask you
to try for a baby...

175
00:09:45,676 --> 00:09:46,677
and just go around drinking?

176
00:09:47,544 --> 00:09:49,212
Why are you like this again?

177
00:10:00,724 --> 00:10:01,625
Honey.

178
00:10:03,994 --> 00:10:04,828
What's wrong?

179
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,041
What's so fun about this for you?

180
00:10:19,443 --> 00:10:22,079
You're not a kid anymore.
What's fun about playing with this?

181
00:10:23,146 --> 00:10:24,481
Why all of a sudden?

182
00:10:24,481 --> 00:10:25,415
Did something happen?

183
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,021
Fine.

184
00:10:31,755 --> 00:10:32,723
Let's forget it.

185
00:10:33,857 --> 00:10:35,025
This is just a doll.

186
00:11:15,599 --> 00:11:18,602
Just report her for workplace harassment.

187
00:11:18,602 --> 00:11:21,438
Figure out a way to win her over instead.

188
00:11:21,438 --> 00:11:23,674
Technically speaking,
you're a saleswoman, aren't you?

189
00:11:24,374 --> 00:11:25,542
What do I do?

190
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:30,247
Hello.

191
00:11:30,247 --> 00:11:31,581
I'm a big fan, Blunt Sister.

192
00:11:41,491 --> 00:11:42,492
What?

193
00:11:42,492 --> 00:11:43,527
Cho Na Jeong.

194
00:11:43,827 --> 00:11:46,463
I told you to play hardball,
not suck up to her.

195
00:11:46,463 --> 00:11:48,098
What deal are you talking about
with someone like her?

196
00:11:48,098 --> 00:11:50,968
Didn't you say
you also have to cover a guest no-show?

197
00:11:51,535 --> 00:11:53,904
Home shopping is the front line
of shopping,

198
00:11:53,904 --> 00:11:55,238
so you two have that in common.

199
00:11:55,238 --> 00:11:58,408
And show hosts are practically
semi-celebrities.

200
00:11:58,809 --> 00:12:02,145
I just hope you don't fall for
that sly fox and end up suffering.

201
00:12:02,145 --> 00:12:04,648
Just think about it this way.

202
00:12:04,648 --> 00:12:07,117
This isn't for her.

203
00:12:07,117 --> 00:12:09,486
It's a high-level strategy and tactic
for our careers.

204
00:12:14,324 --> 00:12:17,094
What did you want so badly
that you called me out?

205
00:12:17,394 --> 00:12:19,062
Spit it out. I'm busy.

206
00:12:19,062 --> 00:12:20,264
Okay.

207
00:12:20,264 --> 00:12:23,533
I don't want to look at you any longer
than I have to, so I'll be quick.

208
00:12:23,533 --> 00:12:26,837
Let's stop this childish attrition battle,

209
00:12:26,837 --> 00:12:29,072
and try something a little more strategic.

210
00:12:29,072 --> 00:12:31,942
No personal feelings.
Let's aim for a win-win.

211
00:12:32,409 --> 00:12:33,410
What are you saying?

212
00:12:34,344 --> 00:12:36,346
Be specific.

213
00:12:36,346 --> 00:12:38,782
You want to be famous, don't you?

214
00:12:39,349 --> 00:12:40,517
I can help you with that.

215
00:12:42,586 --> 00:12:43,854
How exactly would you help me?

216
00:12:44,554 --> 00:12:46,790
You know the deputy editor
at N Life Magazine is my friend, right?

217
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:48,792
The Blunt Sister.

218
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:51,428
I'll get you an interview with her.

219
00:12:51,628 --> 00:12:54,598
In return, you put me on
as the co-host on your broadcast.

220
00:12:58,035 --> 00:13:00,103
But...

221
00:13:00,771 --> 00:13:03,740
if you ask, will she say yes?

222
00:13:04,341 --> 00:13:07,344
I've already talked to my friend
about this.

223
00:13:07,344 --> 00:13:10,080
She said if you're up for it,
she'll make it happen.

224
00:13:14,818 --> 00:13:15,852
If you're not, forget it.

225
00:13:15,852 --> 00:13:16,853
Wait.

226
00:13:18,188 --> 00:13:20,090
Why are you so impatient?

227
00:13:20,991 --> 00:13:23,961
That's not exactly my favorite outlet,

228
00:13:24,528 --> 00:13:26,797
but if you can make it happen, I'll try.

229
00:13:28,365 --> 00:13:29,700
Okay, then.

230
00:13:30,634 --> 00:13:32,736
What are the conditions?

231
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:36,540
First, shoot a vlog of her daily life
and send it.

232
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,142
Then during the interview,
she'll do a photo shoot too.

233
00:13:39,142 --> 00:13:40,677
If the photos turn out well,

234
00:13:40,677 --> 00:13:43,146
they might even run her in print.

235
00:13:44,214 --> 00:13:45,148
Okay.

236
00:13:45,582 --> 00:13:47,284
If a show host's profile goes up,

237
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:48,585
sales go up too.

238
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,189
Then on Ye Na's next broadcast,

239
00:13:52,189 --> 00:13:53,523
will Na Jeong be the co-host?

240
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,426
It is a bit fast,

241
00:13:56,426 --> 00:13:59,529
but I guess a bold investment
is necessary to nurture talent.

242
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,065
Right, good call.

243
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,768
Pairing you two...

244
00:14:04,768 --> 00:14:06,737
has created more synergy than I expected.

245
00:14:07,738 --> 00:14:09,539
Well then, good luck.

246
00:14:09,539 --> 00:14:10,407
Yes.

247
00:14:16,713 --> 00:14:19,116
Sure, you did your part,

248
00:14:19,116 --> 00:14:21,551
but don't get too full of yourself.

249
00:14:21,551 --> 00:14:25,455
Honestly, I've gotten interview offers
from plenty of places too.

250
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:28,592
I was just too lazy to bother.

251
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:30,761
I see.

252
00:14:30,761 --> 00:14:33,096
Anyway, I've done my part,

253
00:14:33,096 --> 00:14:34,998
so I hope you won't forget to do yours.

254
00:14:49,746 --> 00:14:50,781
(In Use)

255
00:14:54,618 --> 00:14:56,320
My gosh.

256
00:14:56,954 --> 00:14:58,255
An interview for N Life Magazine?

257
00:15:08,265 --> 00:15:11,101
If I go live in Jeju for a month,

258
00:15:11,101 --> 00:15:13,937
can you ask Sang Min
to come water the plants here?

259
00:15:28,485 --> 00:15:32,022
I think that opening's a bit cliché.

260
00:15:32,022 --> 00:15:34,758
- Here's coffee for everyone.
- Ms. Cho.

261
00:15:34,758 --> 00:15:36,159
You really didn't have to.

262
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:37,961
An intern should at least do this much.

263
00:15:37,961 --> 00:15:38,962
- By the way,
- Yeah?

264
00:15:38,962 --> 00:15:40,697
how did you talk Ye Na around...

265
00:15:40,697 --> 00:15:41,965
and become the co-host?

266
00:15:42,132 --> 00:15:43,300
It just worked out that way.

267
00:15:44,101 --> 00:15:46,470
- Let's drink coffee.
- Thank you, Ms. Cho.

268
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,171
Thanks to Ms. Cho.

269
00:15:51,441 --> 00:15:53,377
You know today is filming day, right?

270
00:15:53,377 --> 00:15:56,313
Be at Studio A
at our company building by 2 PM.

271
00:15:56,313 --> 00:15:57,147
Okay.

272
00:15:57,147 --> 00:15:58,882
We'll head over right after the meeting.

273
00:15:58,882 --> 00:16:00,651
I hope she's getting good vlog footage.

274
00:16:00,651 --> 00:16:02,085
Hello.

275
00:16:02,085 --> 00:16:05,255
Today, all the staff are gathered...

276
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:07,858
for a brainstorming session...

277
00:16:07,858 --> 00:16:09,526
about the set and the overall broadcast.

278
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,261
Say hi.

279
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:13,463
Hey, what are you doing?
We're in a meeting.

280
00:16:16,133 --> 00:16:16,934
Seriously?

281
00:16:17,501 --> 00:16:19,770
Is everyone going to be
this uncooperative?

282
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:21,972
This isn't for my sake.

283
00:16:21,972 --> 00:16:24,574
It's for the company.

284
00:16:29,012 --> 00:16:31,715
Come on, everyone, bright and cheerful.

285
00:16:31,715 --> 00:16:33,317
- Okay?
- Yes.

286
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,185
Hello.

287
00:16:35,185 --> 00:16:38,121
Hello, subscribers of N Life Magazine.

288
00:16:38,121 --> 00:16:40,791
I'm so happy to meet you like this.

289
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:44,328
Please show lots of love
for Sweet Home Shopping.

290
00:16:44,328 --> 00:16:46,163
Please.

291
00:16:52,903 --> 00:16:54,237
- Na Jeong.
- Hey.

292
00:16:54,237 --> 00:16:57,074
It's been so long
since we went out together like this.

293
00:16:57,708 --> 00:17:00,877
Back then,
we were always out somewhere after work.

294
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:06,817
Right, we were.

295
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:08,986
Those days were so much fun.

296
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:12,122
We drank after the broadcast,

297
00:17:13,724 --> 00:17:15,692
and we'd go on trips too.

298
00:17:15,692 --> 00:17:16,960
Right?

299
00:17:17,261 --> 00:17:19,296
I learned so much from you, Na Jeong,

300
00:17:19,296 --> 00:17:21,498
and I've grown this much thanks to you.

301
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:23,367
- I'm really grateful.
- I see.

302
00:17:23,367 --> 00:17:26,737
If I ever did anything that hurt you,
even a little,

303
00:17:26,737 --> 00:17:27,738
please forgive me.

304
00:17:28,038 --> 00:17:30,407
You know I can be a bit petty sometimes.

305
00:17:30,574 --> 00:17:31,775
You're not.

306
00:17:32,909 --> 00:17:34,711
Right, hang on.

307
00:17:35,145 --> 00:17:36,413
There's something I wanted to give you.

308
00:17:41,385 --> 00:17:44,288
I've only carried this twice,

309
00:17:44,288 --> 00:17:47,190
but I just feel like
it would look perfect on you.

310
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:49,760
But this is expensive.

311
00:17:50,727 --> 00:17:52,729
I'll try to help you as your mentor...

312
00:17:52,729 --> 00:17:54,665
as best as I can,

313
00:17:54,665 --> 00:17:56,833
so from now on, lean on me, okay?

314
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:58,936
Thank you.

315
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:16,526
I'm home.

316
00:22:22,165 --> 00:22:23,200
How have you all been?

317
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:30,974
How are you feeling?

318
00:22:32,676 --> 00:22:34,177
You must feel frustrated
not having a head.

319
00:22:35,345 --> 00:22:36,880
But it should've arrived by now.
How strange.

320
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:40,450
Once it's delivered,

321
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:43,820
you'll have your pretty face back soon.

322
00:22:46,857 --> 00:22:49,526
Yeah, lately she doesn't bring it up.

323
00:22:50,127 --> 00:22:51,328
I guess she's given up.

324
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:53,964
Last time she even came home drunk.

325
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:56,566
Honestly, that's a relief for me.

326
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:59,436
I do feel a little bad, though.

327
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:03,540
Yeah, maybe a bit.

328
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:07,344
You know Joo Young's always by the book.

329
00:23:08,445 --> 00:23:09,947
She's got this fixed idea...

330
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,149
of what a perfect family should be.

331
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:15,419
I think something happened...

332
00:23:16,053 --> 00:23:17,421
when she was young, like me.

333
00:23:18,989 --> 00:23:19,890
In a way,

334
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:21,992
I kind of feel sorry for her.

335
00:23:23,293 --> 00:23:24,227
I heard...

336
00:23:24,227 --> 00:23:25,929
her dad walked out
when she was a senior in high school.

337
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:28,231
But even then, her mom...

338
00:23:28,231 --> 00:23:29,533
You bastard.

339
00:23:38,408 --> 00:23:39,409
Who was that just now?

340
00:23:44,448 --> 00:23:45,349
Don't tell me that was you.

341
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,656
That wasn't you, right?

342
00:23:53,991 --> 00:23:55,225
It was me, you crazy bastard.

343
00:23:58,795 --> 00:24:02,199
What are you doing here?

344
00:24:02,199 --> 00:24:04,268
Me? I'm just...

345
00:24:04,768 --> 00:24:08,372
Well, with my figures here...

346
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:10,307
This is...

347
00:24:12,042 --> 00:24:14,177
You must've been really shocked, honey.

348
00:24:14,544 --> 00:24:16,680
It's a long story,

349
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,048
- but don't get the wrong idea...
- Wrong idea?

350
00:24:18,715 --> 00:24:19,816
What "wrong idea?"

351
00:24:19,816 --> 00:24:22,452
Tell me the truth.

352
00:24:22,452 --> 00:24:23,887
What exactly do you use these for?

353
00:24:23,887 --> 00:24:25,122
I don't use them for anything.

354
00:24:25,122 --> 00:24:26,757
They're my friends. I don't use them.

355
00:24:26,757 --> 00:24:27,858
I've had them since I was a kid and...

356
00:24:27,858 --> 00:24:28,859
So you're saying...

357
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:30,827
these have been around
since before we got married?

358
00:24:32,062 --> 00:24:33,964
Then why did her head
show up in a package?

359
00:24:34,564 --> 00:24:35,766
Answer me.

360
00:24:37,134 --> 00:24:40,037
Because of that flood last time,
the basement filled up,

361
00:24:40,504 --> 00:24:42,339
and Jessica's face got mold on it.

362
00:24:42,339 --> 00:24:43,173
What?

363
00:24:45,008 --> 00:24:45,876
Jessica?

364
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:51,581
You disgusting freak.

365
00:24:52,716 --> 00:24:53,984
Hey, what are you doing?

366
00:24:53,984 --> 00:24:55,485
Let go.

367
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:57,854
- I'm burning these.
- No.

368
00:24:57,854 --> 00:24:59,456
Let go, you creep.

369
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:01,091
- Please.
- Let go.

370
00:25:12,569 --> 00:25:13,437
Rebecca.

371
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:17,174
Rebecca!

372
00:25:17,174 --> 00:25:18,208
No.

373
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:21,945
Rebecca.

374
00:25:25,282 --> 00:25:26,883
Rebecca.

375
00:25:36,426 --> 00:25:37,995
Rebecca.

376
00:25:41,932 --> 00:25:42,966
Il Ri.

377
00:25:44,601 --> 00:25:46,536
- Hey.
- Hey.

378
00:25:47,904 --> 00:25:49,873
This is show host Song Ye Na.

379
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,908
And this is Deputy Editor Lee Il Ri.

380
00:25:56,446 --> 00:25:57,748
Hello.

381
00:25:57,748 --> 00:26:00,117
Do you remember me?
We met at the mall last time.

382
00:26:00,117 --> 00:26:03,453
I told you then I was a huge fan
of your show, Blunt Sister.

383
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:06,223
I've heard so much about you.
I feel like I already know you.

384
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:07,291
Sorry?

385
00:26:09,393 --> 00:26:12,062
Where's the makeup room?
Could you show her?

386
00:26:12,062 --> 00:26:13,897
- Yes, I'll take you right over.
- Okay.

387
00:26:19,336 --> 00:26:21,471
Il Ri, please control your temper.

388
00:26:21,805 --> 00:26:22,572
What did I do?

389
00:26:27,678 --> 00:26:29,046
All set.

390
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:30,047
Thank you.

391
00:26:32,749 --> 00:26:34,751
Please change into this outfit.

392
00:26:34,751 --> 00:26:37,454
That's gorgeous.

393
00:26:37,454 --> 00:26:39,790
I love this 60s-style jacket.

394
00:26:40,524 --> 00:26:42,326
Thank you, Deputy Editor.

395
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:45,963
I swear I'm not just flattering you.

396
00:26:45,963 --> 00:26:48,365
I'm a huge fan
of Blunt Sister's Sensible Advice.

397
00:26:48,365 --> 00:26:49,967
I've watched every episode from the start.

398
00:26:49,967 --> 00:26:51,368
I'm truly a huge fan.

399
00:26:51,835 --> 00:26:52,836
Thank you.

400
00:26:52,836 --> 00:26:54,638
Especially the older woman
and younger man episode.

401
00:26:54,638 --> 00:26:56,840
That one was so much fun.

402
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,676
Are you and your boyfriend
still arguing over texting these days?

403
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:01,545
We broke up recently.

404
00:27:02,379 --> 00:27:03,180
I see.

405
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,748
Sorry.

406
00:27:05,349 --> 00:27:07,651
Then should I set you up on a blind date?

407
00:27:08,352 --> 00:27:09,319
No, that's okay.

408
00:27:09,319 --> 00:27:10,754
Actually,

409
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:14,358
the moment I saw you, Deputy Editor,
someone popped into my head.

410
00:27:15,058 --> 00:27:16,727
He's a director
at one of our partner companies,

411
00:27:16,727 --> 00:27:18,795
and honestly, of all the people I've met,

412
00:27:18,795 --> 00:27:21,665
he's got the best personality,
perfect manners,

413
00:27:22,633 --> 00:27:23,700
and he's totally loaded.

414
00:27:24,167 --> 00:27:25,168
He owns two buildings.

415
00:27:27,504 --> 00:27:28,372
Hang on.

416
00:27:29,873 --> 00:27:30,874
Here.

417
00:27:30,874 --> 00:27:34,711
He's in his mid-forties now.

418
00:27:35,746 --> 00:27:36,880
Here he is.

419
00:27:37,514 --> 00:27:38,248
What do you think?

420
00:27:45,689 --> 00:27:47,424
Why? You don't like him?

421
00:27:48,959 --> 00:27:50,160
Well,

422
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,396
this was taken when we all went
to Namhansanseong for chicken stew,

423
00:27:52,396 --> 00:27:54,498
so he looks a bit older here.

424
00:27:54,498 --> 00:27:56,733
In person, he's really handsome.

425
00:27:57,267 --> 00:28:00,203
If he's that great,
why don't you go out with him, Ye Na?

426
00:28:01,838 --> 00:28:04,841
The age gap between us is huge,

427
00:28:04,841 --> 00:28:06,410
and he's not really my type.

428
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:10,948
Are you really not interested,
Deputy Editor?

429
00:28:12,049 --> 00:28:14,117
She really is the nightmare
Na Jeong says she is.

430
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,189
Is everything going smoothly?

431
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:22,159
Yes, everything's going well.

432
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,195
Na Jeong's doing better than I expected.

433
00:28:25,195 --> 00:28:27,998
As a mentee, she's pretty satisfying.

434
00:28:29,366 --> 00:28:31,868
What else would you like to know, editors?

435
00:28:31,868 --> 00:28:33,370
I have a question.

436
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:37,007
Since home shopping sells
such a wide range of products,

437
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:40,944
you must get ridiculous customers
or nightmare viewers.

438
00:28:42,045 --> 00:28:43,647
Yes, tons.

439
00:28:43,647 --> 00:28:47,951
The customer service staff especially
have a hard time with that.

440
00:28:47,951 --> 00:28:50,253
For example, there are endless cases
where people send things back...

441
00:28:50,253 --> 00:28:52,789
after using them for a month or two.

442
00:28:52,789 --> 00:28:55,826
And plenty of people ask for returns
for completely absurd reasons.

443
00:28:55,826 --> 00:28:57,828
They return products
after using them for one or two months?

444
00:28:57,828 --> 00:28:58,795
Yes.

445
00:28:58,795 --> 00:29:00,864
Not only shoes or clothes.

446
00:29:01,298 --> 00:29:03,400
Some people even return underwear
they've already worn.

447
00:29:04,434 --> 00:29:05,636
My gosh.

448
00:29:07,137 --> 00:29:10,307
One time, there was a customer
who bought sanitary pads.

449
00:29:10,807 --> 00:29:11,975
As you know,

450
00:29:11,975 --> 00:29:15,345
the ones sold on home shopping
come in huge bulk packs.

451
00:29:15,345 --> 00:29:18,282
But she suddenly called...

452
00:29:18,282 --> 00:29:20,150
and said she'd gone into menopause,

453
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:22,286
and that she didn't need pads anymore.

454
00:29:22,286 --> 00:29:23,553
No way.

455
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:26,823
She should've bought pomegranate extract
or something instead.

456
00:29:26,823 --> 00:29:28,025
Exactly.

457
00:29:28,525 --> 00:29:30,827
I used to sell pomegranate extract too.

458
00:29:31,328 --> 00:29:32,763
Do you drink it by any chance?

459
00:29:37,868 --> 00:29:40,704
These days,
menopause is happening earlier,

460
00:29:40,704 --> 00:29:43,807
so lots of women in their 40s take it
as part of their routine.

461
00:29:44,541 --> 00:29:47,010
Pomegranate extract
is really good for women.

462
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:48,078
I highly recommend it.

463
00:29:49,346 --> 00:29:53,216
Show hosts like you are all so slim.

464
00:29:53,216 --> 00:29:55,852
You must be under a lot of pressure...

465
00:29:55,852 --> 00:29:58,121
to stay a size XS or S.

466
00:29:58,322 --> 00:30:00,590
Do you have any go-to diet tips?

467
00:30:02,859 --> 00:30:03,994

What brings you in today?

471
00:30:16,039 --> 00:30:19,343
I'm just not the type who gains easily,

472
00:30:19,676 --> 00:30:21,511
so even if I eat whatever I want,

473
00:30:21,511 --> 00:30:24,281
after doing live shows for over an hour
and doing market research,

474
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:25,916
there's barely any time to put on weight.

479
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,114
Yes, sir.

480
00:31:31,114 --> 00:31:33,216
You weren't at your desk. Where are you?

481
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:35,085
I've left for the day. I'm outside.

482
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:37,354
Did something happen?

483
00:31:37,988 --> 00:31:39,256
Have you been drinking?

484
00:31:40,791 --> 00:31:41,592
Yes.

485
00:31:41,592 --> 00:31:43,060
Team Leader Gu, what's with you lately?

486
00:31:43,694 --> 00:31:46,196
You never used to mess up the schedule,

487
00:31:46,697 --> 00:31:47,965
but now your reports are late,

488
00:31:47,965 --> 00:31:49,166
and you leave the workplace
whenever you can.

489
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,302
I even heard a rumor
you're getting divorced.

490
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:54,605
Is that why you've been spaced out lately?

491
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:58,008
Even if your personal life is a mess,

492
00:31:58,008 --> 00:31:59,610
you can't let it spill into your work.

493
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:00,644
What?

494
00:32:01,678 --> 00:32:04,681

making excuses later.

- Cheers.
- Great job today.

00:32:26,703 --> 00:32:27,804
You did a great job today.

502
00:32:27,804 --> 00:32:28,939
Yes, you did.

503
00:32:28,939 --> 00:32:30,540
How are you so good on camera?

- You did great.
- You were amazing.

together with bratty Song Ye Na,

511
00:32:47,257 --> 00:32:48,892
I thought something might blow up.

Anyway, I'm so relieved
it all wrapped up safely.

Thanks, my friend.

514
00:32:54,865 --> 00:32:56,433
I have so much to say.

515
00:32:57,067 --> 00:32:58,702
Why? What happened?

517
00:33:01,905 --> 00:33:02,706
Hey.

518
00:33:05,042 --> 00:33:06,910
- Have a drink with me too.
- Sure.

00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:08,412
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

- Na Jeong.
- Yes?

521
00:33:15,185 --> 00:33:19,222
Thank you so much for landing me
such an incredible interview.

522
00:33:19,723 --> 00:33:22,392
And thank you too, Deputy Editor.

523
00:33:22,993 --> 00:33:25,529
During the photo shoot today,

524
00:33:25,529 --> 00:33:27,164
I was honestly over the moon.

525
00:33:28,398 --> 00:33:31,201
Why were you over the moon
about the same old clothes...

526
00:33:31,201 --> 00:33:32,803
and the same old makeup?

527
00:33:32,803 --> 00:33:34,471
No.

528
00:33:34,471 --> 00:33:36,707
Normally, I'm not the main character.

529
00:33:36,707 --> 00:33:38,642
The product is.

530
00:33:39,009 --> 00:33:42,379
So no matter how good I look,

531
00:33:42,679 --> 00:33:44,014
I'm always the sidekick.

532
00:33:44,615 --> 00:33:46,717
But today,

533
00:33:46,717 --> 00:33:48,952
I was the star.

534
00:33:50,454 --> 00:33:54,524
So this is what it feels like
to be the lead.

535
00:33:58,161 --> 00:33:59,763
Na Jeong, I'm sorry.

536
00:33:59,763 --> 00:34:00,597
It's okay.

537
00:34:01,198 --> 00:34:02,699
I'm going to the restroom.

538
00:34:08,572 --> 00:34:09,773
But Deputy Editor,

539
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:13,243
was that director really that bad?

540
00:34:13,243 --> 00:34:14,111
Yes.

541
00:34:14,344 --> 00:34:16,780
I'm not planning on getting married yet.

542
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:18,982
Come on.

543
00:34:18,982 --> 00:34:20,851
Deputy Editor, you're 41, right?

544
00:34:21,251 --> 00:34:24,354
If you don't get moving now,
you really might miss your window.

545
00:34:24,354 --> 00:34:26,256
How can you be so out of touch
with reality?

546
00:34:26,556 --> 00:34:29,893
And heartbreak...

547
00:34:29,893 --> 00:34:32,129
is always healed by someone new.

548
00:34:32,496 --> 00:34:33,630
The tougher it is,

549
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:36,500
the more people you should meet.

550
00:34:37,467 --> 00:34:39,369
If you're that against it, fine.

551
00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:41,838
Forget it.
I'll set him up with someone else.

552
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,975
Your standards...

553
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:47,778
are pretty high, Deputy Editor.

554
00:34:50,847 --> 00:34:54,151
But, Deputy Editor, can I ask a favor?

555
00:34:54,151 --> 00:34:56,119
That talk about dieting from earlier.

556
00:34:56,119 --> 00:34:59,022
Can you please cut that part out?

557
00:34:59,022 --> 00:34:59,890
Why?

558
00:35:00,257 --> 00:35:01,291
It's just...

559
00:35:02,826 --> 00:35:05,362
just please take it out.

560
00:35:05,796 --> 00:35:08,031
To me, it didn't seem
like there was any issue.

561
00:35:08,365 --> 00:35:09,333
Don't worry.

562
00:35:09,333 --> 00:35:11,535
We'll cut anything
that might cause trouble.

563
00:35:11,535 --> 00:35:12,869
Seriously?

564
00:35:13,637 --> 00:35:17,274
Celebrities get
whatever they want edited out.

565
00:35:17,908 --> 00:35:20,510
Are you discriminating
between celebrities and show hosts?

566
00:35:21,578 --> 00:35:22,479
Discriminating?

567
00:35:22,479 --> 00:35:24,448
Isn't this discrimination?

568
00:35:24,448 --> 00:35:27,217
Celebrities get to see
the edited cut in advance...

569
00:35:27,217 --> 00:35:29,886
and even approve it. I know how it works.

570
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:34,591
Honestly, I'm a public figure too,
making a living off my appearance.

571
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:38,128
So please, just edit it out.

572
00:35:38,729 --> 00:35:39,830
Ms. Song Ye Na,

573
00:35:40,364 --> 00:35:43,133
we have the final say in editing.
That's enough.

574
00:35:43,333 --> 00:35:45,369
Hey, Il Ri, can we talk for a sec?

575
00:35:45,369 --> 00:35:46,536
About what?

576
00:35:46,536 --> 00:35:49,573
Let's go outside. Come on.

577
00:35:52,042 --> 00:35:53,176
Hey.

578
00:35:54,711 --> 00:35:55,712
What's your problem?

579
00:35:55,979 --> 00:35:57,581
How can you yank someone out of
their seat like that in front of everyone?

580
00:35:57,581 --> 00:35:58,849
What does that make me look like?

581
00:35:58,849 --> 00:36:01,018
I'm asking you like this,

582
00:36:01,018 --> 00:36:02,753
so please just cut it for her if you can.

583
00:36:02,753 --> 00:36:05,255
From her point of view,
it might really bother her.

584
00:36:08,725 --> 00:36:10,861
Why are you being
so submissive to her today?

585
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:13,430
Did you forget everything
she put you through?

586
00:36:13,897 --> 00:36:15,065
Are you so blinded by success...

587
00:36:15,065 --> 00:36:17,467
you just threw your pride away?

588
00:36:17,467 --> 00:36:19,670
I told you not to grovel
to trash like her.

589
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:20,671
Knock it off, Lee Il Ri.

590
00:36:20,671 --> 00:36:22,139
Knock off what?

591
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:23,740
To be honest, I never liked her.

592
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:26,576
The only reason I tolerated her
was because you asked me to.

593
00:36:26,576 --> 00:36:29,913
And instead of being grateful,
this is how you treat me?

594
00:36:29,913 --> 00:36:30,681
Hey.

595
00:36:37,321 --> 00:36:38,255
Ye Na.

596
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,061
Ye Na.

597
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:48,865
Song Ye Na, let me explain.

598
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:53,470
Did you talk trash about me to her?

599
00:36:56,707 --> 00:36:59,476
Of course, you did. I knew it.

600
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:02,312
You teamed up with her from the start
just to screw me over, didn't you?

601
00:37:02,479 --> 00:37:04,514
What are you even talking about?

602
00:37:04,514 --> 00:37:06,216
Isn't that right?

603
00:37:06,516 --> 00:37:08,952
You guys were planning to edit the show
all weird on purpose just to ruin me.

604
00:37:08,952 --> 00:37:10,654
To get revenge for what happened before.

605
00:37:10,654 --> 00:37:12,823
Why are you imagining things?

606
00:37:12,823 --> 00:37:13,690
You know,

607
00:37:14,157 --> 00:37:15,359
ever since the old days,

608
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,394
nothing has ever gone right
whenever I got mixed up with you.

609
00:37:17,561 --> 00:37:19,830
You hogged all the spotlight,

610
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:22,633
looked down on me, and pushed me around
just because you were the senior.

611
00:37:22,633 --> 00:37:25,602
Do you know
how much I hated you for that?

612
00:37:25,602 --> 00:37:26,703
And you?

613
00:37:26,703 --> 00:37:28,171
You went around saying
I was slacking off because of my kid.

614
00:37:28,171 --> 00:37:30,007
You were talking behind my back
to everyone.

615
00:37:30,007 --> 00:37:32,442
When you asked to switch teams,
that really hurt me.

616
00:37:32,809 --> 00:37:34,211
After everything I did for you.

617
00:37:34,211 --> 00:37:36,947
You were a burden back then.

618
00:37:36,947 --> 00:37:38,548
Being a working mom isn't
some kind of privilege.

619
00:37:42,452 --> 00:37:43,287
You're right.

620
00:37:44,054 --> 00:37:45,422
Being a working mom isn't
some kind of privilege.

621
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:47,791
But people have ups and downs in life,

622
00:37:47,791 --> 00:37:50,227
good times
and times they're barely holding on.

623
00:37:50,794 --> 00:37:52,562
Even so, did you really
have to see that as your chance...

624
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:54,731
and drag me down like that?

625
00:37:54,731 --> 00:37:56,633
You're doing the same thing right now.

626
00:37:57,734 --> 00:37:58,568
You're right.

627
00:37:59,102 --> 00:38:00,304
I hated you,

628
00:38:00,304 --> 00:38:03,473
but I was still grateful
you got me this shot.

629
00:38:04,241 --> 00:38:07,077
So I even felt a little sorry
for what I did back then.

630
00:38:08,078 --> 00:38:09,279
But look at this.

631
00:38:09,479 --> 00:38:10,781
You were talking behind my back.

632
00:38:12,849 --> 00:38:14,384
You're no different from me, Na Jeong.

633
00:38:23,527 --> 00:38:25,028
- Il Ri.
- Ms. Cho.

634
00:38:25,796 --> 00:38:26,630
Yes?

635
00:38:27,965 --> 00:38:29,733
Ms. Lee left.

636
00:38:51,688 --> 00:38:53,423
(Sanitary pads)

637
00:39:20,017 --> 00:39:21,952
(Missed call - Naraeng)

638
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:33,096
(Matchmaking...)

639
00:39:49,613 --> 00:39:50,847
Il Ri.

640
00:39:51,782 --> 00:39:52,749
Lee Il Ri.

641
00:39:53,083 --> 00:39:54,785
Are you really not going to answer?

642
00:40:06,863 --> 00:40:09,032
Did you get home okay last night?

643
00:40:26,683 --> 00:40:28,352
(Producer Kim Tae Jeong)

644
00:40:28,919 --> 00:40:30,020
What happened?

645
00:40:30,654 --> 00:40:31,922
I heard Ye Na asked...

646
00:40:31,922 --> 00:40:33,790
to switch her co-host to Ms. Yang

647
00:40:34,224 --> 00:40:35,192
What?

648
00:40:37,461 --> 00:40:39,229
What are you talking about?

649
00:40:39,429 --> 00:40:40,697
Seon Young said...

650
00:40:40,697 --> 00:40:42,899
Ye Na told her
she couldn't be on air with you...

651
00:40:42,899 --> 00:40:45,135
and asked to make
Ms. Yang the co-host instead.

652
00:40:45,135 --> 00:40:47,504
After all the prep meetings
she did with you,

653
00:40:47,504 --> 00:40:48,872
why would she suddenly want someone else?

654
00:40:51,942 --> 00:40:52,843
Ye Na.

655
00:40:55,545 --> 00:40:58,649
Did you tell them to cut me
and make Yang Mi Sook the co-host instead?

656
00:40:59,116 --> 00:40:59,883
Yes.

657
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:03,820
That's not what we agreed on.

658
00:41:04,554 --> 00:41:06,523
We said if I got you the interview,
you'd take me as the co...

659
00:41:06,523 --> 00:41:08,959
I called N Life Magazine...

660
00:41:09,293 --> 00:41:12,296
and told them not to run the interview.

661
00:41:12,296 --> 00:41:13,263
So...

662
00:41:14,131 --> 00:41:15,766
that means I don't owe you anything now.

663
00:41:32,716 --> 00:41:33,517
Right.

664
00:41:34,351 --> 00:41:35,786
This package is great.

665
00:41:35,786 --> 00:41:38,055
Right? So I thought...

666
00:41:38,055 --> 00:41:40,557
I'd try to highlight as many strengths
as possible here...

667
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,335
The Head of Division is here.

668
00:41:55,172 --> 00:41:55,973
Yes.

669
00:41:57,374 --> 00:41:58,308
You can sit down.

670
00:42:00,644 --> 00:42:03,747
You all remember
we've got a team dinner tonight, right?

671
00:42:03,747 --> 00:42:04,615
Yes.

672
00:42:06,617 --> 00:42:08,518
The interns have been here
for a while now,

673
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:10,454
and we haven't
even welcomed them properly.

674
00:42:12,723 --> 00:42:14,591
Let's grab something good to eat later.

675
00:42:20,631 --> 00:42:21,531
Good work, everyone.

676
00:42:25,469 --> 00:42:29,006
By the way, what division is he heading?

677
00:42:30,574 --> 00:42:32,709
He's the Head of Broadcasting Support,

678
00:42:33,076 --> 00:42:34,911
and he's the nephew
of the chairman's wife.

679
00:42:35,879 --> 00:42:36,880
Seriously?

680
00:42:38,415 --> 00:42:39,316
No way.

681
00:42:55,966 --> 00:42:57,000
Everyone.

682
00:42:58,001 --> 00:43:01,038
We have a new friend
joining our Sky Class.

683
00:43:02,406 --> 00:43:04,741
Ri Ae, do you want to say hi
to your friends?

684
00:43:04,741 --> 00:43:05,542
Yes.

685
00:43:06,576 --> 00:43:09,146
Hi, I'm Joo Ri Ae.

686
00:43:09,546 --> 00:43:10,747
Nice to meet you all.

687
00:43:13,784 --> 00:43:16,520
Be nice to our new friend.

688
00:43:18,021 --> 00:43:20,057
Ri Ae, your cubby...

689
00:43:22,526 --> 00:43:23,760
is this one.

690
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,295
I'll put your backpack inside.

691
00:43:30,167 --> 00:43:31,335
And your seat...

692
00:43:32,269 --> 00:43:33,070
is here.

693
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:37,941
My name is Noh Min Woo.

694
00:43:38,609 --> 00:43:39,776
I'm Joo Ri Ae.

695
00:44:02,833 --> 00:44:03,934
Okay.

696
00:44:04,234 --> 00:44:06,169
I'm Yang Mi Sook.
I don't slack off at work,

697
00:44:06,169 --> 00:44:07,904
and I don't hold back when I play.

698
00:44:07,904 --> 00:44:09,239
Nice to meet you all.

699
00:44:09,239 --> 00:44:10,007
Okay.

700
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:14,111
Everyone.

701
00:44:14,811 --> 00:44:18,482
Remember, each one of you
represents our company.

702
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:21,351
Make life sweet,

703
00:44:21,918 --> 00:44:24,021
and make sales sweet.

704
00:44:24,021 --> 00:44:25,022
Sweet.

705
00:44:25,022 --> 00:44:26,823
Home Shopping.

706
00:44:42,372 --> 00:44:43,607
Yeah, they've eaten.

707
00:44:44,141 --> 00:44:46,276
And don't let them stay up too late.

708
00:44:46,276 --> 00:44:47,844
Make sure they're in bed before nine.

709
00:44:47,844 --> 00:44:49,046
I will.

710
00:44:49,046 --> 00:44:51,848
Min Jun needs to use the bathroom
before bed,

711
00:44:51,848 --> 00:44:53,383
or he'll wet the sheets.

712
00:44:53,383 --> 00:44:54,885
Okay, okay.

713
00:45:03,694 --> 00:45:04,595
Ye Na.

714
00:45:04,928 --> 00:45:06,263
Come on.

715
00:45:07,397 --> 00:45:08,765
Sir, you're drunk.

716
00:45:08,765 --> 00:45:10,534
I'm not drunk.

717
00:45:10,534 --> 00:45:11,401
Hey.

718
00:45:26,984 --> 00:45:27,751
Na Jeong.

719
00:45:27,751 --> 00:45:28,852
Yes?

720
00:45:28,852 --> 00:45:29,786
Why are you out here?

721
00:45:30,654 --> 00:45:33,490
It's you, Mr. Kim.

722
00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:34,691
I didn't know you were here too, Ye Na.

723
00:45:34,691 --> 00:45:37,561
I was just calling my husband.

724
00:45:37,561 --> 00:45:38,295
I see.

725
00:45:39,863 --> 00:45:42,699
Ye Na didn't look well.
Her face has been pale since earlier.

726
00:45:43,333 --> 00:45:44,534
As the head of division,

727
00:45:45,402 --> 00:45:46,603
I should look after her.

728
00:45:47,404 --> 00:45:48,939
Yes, of course.

729
00:45:50,173 --> 00:45:51,441
- Come in.
- Yes.

730
00:45:55,779 --> 00:45:56,780
What was that?

731
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:59,182
Why are you butting into
other people's business?

732
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:02,152

that I'm at the hospital.

If anything needs approval, message me.

741

Okay, Mom.

748
00:47:09,987 --> 00:47:11,622
Don't worry. I'm not running away.

749
00:47:12,089 --> 00:47:14,024
I'll get a consultation first
and call you.

750
00:47:15,459 --> 00:47:17,594
I told you I didn't want this.
Why'd you sign me up...

751
00:47:17,594 --> 00:47:19,463
and make things harder for me?

752
00:47:25,068 --> 00:47:26,503
A grade C?

753
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:29,239
With my looks and my name recognition,

754
00:47:29,239 --> 00:47:32,009
and my job, how am I a C?

755
00:47:32,009 --> 00:47:33,143
I know.

756
00:47:33,143 --> 00:47:36,046
Given your looks and profile,

757
00:47:36,046 --> 00:47:38,081
it makes sense that you're be shocked.

758
00:47:39,116 --> 00:47:40,717
But surprisingly,

759
00:47:40,717 --> 00:47:42,819

760
00:47:42,819 --> 00:47:45,489

Lawyers, doctors, pharmacists.

Those kinds of professions
are what rank as grade A.

Right, I get it.

764
00:47:56,633 --> 00:47:59,136
So is that the biggest issue?

765
00:47:59,636 --> 00:48:02,239
Or is something else wrong?

766
00:48:05,042 --> 00:48:06,977
The real problem...

767
00:48:06,977 --> 00:48:10,314
is that you're already a bit older
for having children, and...

768
00:48:10,781 --> 00:48:14,017
I already said
I'm not planning on having kids.

769
00:48:14,551 --> 00:48:16,253

Right. Vibes.

778
00:48:41,411 --> 00:48:43,814
Vibes are great. They're important.

00:48:44,815 --> 00:48:46,116

Right.

784
00:49:02,399 --> 00:49:03,667
Seriously?

785
00:49:04,368 --> 00:49:06,436
Did she pass out
after drinking last night?

786
00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:08,839
Why'd she leave someone waiting
for two hours?

00:49:11,575 --> 00:49:12,442
Yeah?

789
00:49:12,442 --> 00:49:14,344

790
00:49:15,379 --> 00:49:16,913
No, nothing.

791
00:49:17,648 --> 00:49:19,716
How can you stay so calm...

792
00:49:19,716 --> 00:49:20,917
when your own mentor can't be reached?

793
00:49:21,685 --> 00:49:23,787
Then and now,

794
00:49:23,787 --> 00:49:26,390
you've always been out for yourself.
That hasn't changed one bit.

795
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:27,658
Whatever.

796
00:49:29,026 --> 00:49:31,428
- Hello.
- Hello.

797
00:49:33,230 --> 00:49:34,898
I can't even.

798
00:49:44,741 --> 00:49:45,943
How strange.

799
00:49:46,843 --> 00:49:48,345
Her personality is a mess,

800
00:49:48,345 --> 00:49:50,714
but she's never the type
to break an appointment.

Have you seen Song Ye Na anywhere?

804
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:31,288
I haven't.

805
00:50:31,755 --> 00:50:35,092
How weird.
Why won't she answer her phone?

806
00:50:35,092 --> 00:50:36,260
Yeah, she's not picking up.

807
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:38,462
If you run into her,

808
00:50:38,462 --> 00:50:41,231
could you tell her she has to turn in
the mentee evaluation today?

should I just go to Ye Na's place?

813
00:50:49,906 --> 00:50:51,875
I can talk to her
about the evaluation too.

814

Yes, please do.

815
00:50:53,810 --> 00:50:55,012

What happened?

842
00:55:04,227 --> 00:55:06,263
You had emergency surgery
because of a bowel obstruction.

843
00:55:06,630 --> 00:55:08,599
The doctor asked
how little you must've been eating...

844
00:55:08,599 --> 00:55:10,734
for your intestines to stick together.

845
00:55:11,735 --> 00:55:14,404
No wonder. You never ate rice...

846
00:55:14,404 --> 00:55:16,640

You're not someone
who breaks appointments.

And you'd been looking pale
for a few days already.

853

Well, you're my mentor.

855
00:55:41,665 --> 00:55:43,500
What if something had happened?

856
00:55:44,701 --> 00:55:48,005
I panicked and just ran over.

857

This might not be the best time,

858
00:55:57,648 --> 00:55:59,483
but I'm sorry about last time.

It's not like I was bad-mouthing you
from the start.

you didn't want to work with me,

862

You have no idea, Na Jeong.

You have no idea how hard it was for me.

874
00:56:59,943 --> 00:57:01,111
and you have a husband.

like some greedy hog.

00:57:14,524 --> 00:57:16,393
So I hated you.

879
00:57:17,894 --> 00:57:19,796
I hated you so much.

and look at this mess.

883
00:57:44,288 --> 00:57:45,188
I told you.

884
00:57:45,922 --> 00:57:48,325
Why did you get swept up
in such ridiculous claims?

885
00:57:49,026 --> 00:57:50,560
Now things have blown up for no reason.

886
00:57:51,261 --> 00:57:52,829
Even if this goes to court,

887
00:57:52,829 --> 00:57:54,965
she'll be the only one completely ruined.

888
00:57:55,666 --> 00:57:56,600
What do we do now?

889
00:57:58,302 --> 00:57:59,169
Then,

890
00:57:59,836 --> 00:58:01,872
since you're still seeing Seon Min,

891
00:58:02,372 --> 00:58:03,473
why don't you talk to her yourself?

892
00:58:04,741 --> 00:58:05,642
Sorry?

893
00:58:05,642 --> 00:58:08,178
Why? You thought I didn't know?

894
00:58:10,647 --> 00:58:13,984
You've been helping her find jobs,

895
00:58:13,984 --> 00:58:15,953
comforting her, and all that.

896
00:58:15,953 --> 00:58:18,522
So of course, people gossip.

897
00:58:18,522 --> 00:58:20,590
I told you to step back,
but you didn't listen.

898
00:58:21,058 --> 00:58:23,126
If you keep this up,

899
00:58:23,126 --> 00:58:25,495
I can't protect you anymore.

00:58:32,469 --> 00:58:35,038
At this rate,
even Na Jeong, who's doing fine at work...

904
00:58:35,038 --> 00:58:36,873
will get dragged down.

905
00:58:38,208 --> 00:58:39,443
You're the breadwinner.

906
00:58:39,710 --> 00:58:42,579
Do you want your innocent wife
to lose her job over this?

907
00:58:56,093 --> 00:58:56,994
Producer Noh.

908
00:58:57,427 --> 00:59:01,198
I'm waiting at the café out front.

909
00:59:01,498 --> 00:59:03,300
Can we talk for a moment?

910
00:59:04,735 --> 00:59:05,802
Me again?

911
00:59:06,403 --> 00:59:07,204
Why?

912
00:59:07,204 --> 00:59:08,672
We discussed it,

913
00:59:08,672 --> 00:59:10,807
and with Seon Young
already covering for Ye Na,

914
00:59:10,807 --> 00:59:13,210
letting someone inexperienced
like Ms. Yang be the co-host...

915
00:59:13,210 --> 00:59:14,544
is too risky.

916
00:59:14,544 --> 00:59:16,380
The partner companies won't tolerate it.

917
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:19,049
And you handled
all the pre-meetings anyway.

918
00:59:19,416 --> 00:59:21,652
So we think it's best
if you be the co-host again.

919
00:59:24,121 --> 00:59:24,955
Why?

920
00:59:26,323 --> 00:59:27,224
You don't want to?

921
00:59:27,724 --> 00:59:28,959
No.

922
00:59:30,127 --> 00:59:31,561
Of course, not.

923
00:59:34,831 --> 00:59:35,866
Bye.

924
00:59:38,302 --> 00:59:39,636
(Yang Mi Sook)

925
00:59:41,738 --> 00:59:43,640
- Hello?
- You.

926
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:45,575
Come out to the café out front.
We need to talk.

927
00:59:46,076 --> 00:59:48,879
We can talk at work.
Why make me go all the way out there?

928
00:59:48,879 --> 00:59:51,615
Do you want everyone at work...

929
00:59:52,849 --> 00:59:54,484
to watch interns fight, you idiot?

930
01:01:09,526 --> 01:01:10,294
Honey?

931
01:01:11,929 --> 01:01:12,863
Hey.

932
01:01:14,064 --> 01:01:15,332
What are you doing here?

933
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:18,201
What are you doing here, honey?

934
01:02:26,903 --> 01:02:29,006
(Don't call me ma'am)

935
01:02:29,339 --> 01:02:31,108
That show host from earlier.

936
01:02:31,108 --> 01:02:33,644
She was bawling in front of you.

937
01:02:34,077 --> 01:02:36,513
You've already been on air once.

938
01:02:36,513 --> 01:02:38,682
So tell them you'll give your spot to me.

939
01:02:38,682 --> 01:02:40,183
Mom, this is my girlfriend.

940
01:02:40,183 --> 01:02:41,852
Mom, this is my boyfriend.

941
01:02:42,953 --> 01:02:43,654
No.

942
01:02:44,554 --> 01:02:45,656
What happened?

943
01:02:45,656 --> 01:02:47,891
Why are you crying like a kid
out here like this?

944
01:02:47,891 --> 01:02:49,793
Hey, you like me, don't you?

945
01:02:50,661 --> 01:02:51,929
What's wrong with you?

946
01:02:51,929 --> 01:02:52,996
Living with you...

947
01:02:53,864 --> 01:02:54,965
felt suffocating.

948
01:02:54,965 --> 01:02:56,800
So you're saying...

949
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:58,402
I got special treatment
because of my husband?

950
01:02:58,402 --> 01:03:00,404
I wanted to go back to work,
but I had no opportunities.

951
01:03:00,404 --> 01:03:02,005
What does that have to do
with the interview?

952
01:03:02,005 --> 01:03:04,007
When we first met, you said...

953
01:03:04,007 --> 01:03:06,443
you were already set to work
at Sweet Home Shopping.

954
01:03:06,777 --> 01:03:07,644
What?

955
01:03:10,948 --> 01:03:12,950
