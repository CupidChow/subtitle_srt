You're making such a fuss.

9
00:00:50,556 --> 00:00:53,559
You don't trust people,
so you even ask for a receipt.

10
00:00:54,727 --> 00:00:57,596
Well, better safe than sorry.

11
00:00:57,596 --> 00:00:58,430
Thanks.

12
00:01:00,332 --> 00:01:02,468
Did you take a day off work today?

13
00:01:03,235 --> 00:01:04,503
That company's pretty lenient.

14
00:01:04,503 --> 00:01:06,205
They even let rookies take days off.

15
00:01:06,205 --> 00:01:07,106
Well,

16
00:01:08,207 --> 00:01:11,243
since I used to work there before,
they give me leeway.

17
00:01:11,243 --> 00:01:12,945
I'll go now.
Bye, ma'am.

18
00:01:12,945 --> 00:01:14,313
Bye, Ms. Cho.

19
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,888
Really?

20
00:01:22,888 --> 00:01:24,990
Even when I offered to work unpaid first,
they said no?

21
00:01:27,326 --> 00:01:30,529
There's nothing we can do, then. Okay.

22
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:32,932
Still, thank you for checking.

23
00:01:32,932 --> 00:01:35,000
Yes, bye.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,835
Okay.

25
00:01:37,436 --> 00:01:39,839
That's really harsh.

26
00:01:40,306 --> 00:01:41,841
They said no,
even when I said I'd work for free.

34
00:02:25,351 --> 00:02:27,520
Snooping? Why so defensive?

35
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,555
Are you texting your girlfriend or what?

36
00:02:29,555 --> 00:02:30,656
That's ridiculous.

37
00:02:34,727 --> 00:02:36,162
Honey.

How is that?

40
00:02:41,133 --> 00:02:42,701
Are there many applicants?

41
00:02:42,701 --> 00:02:43,636
I don't know.

42
00:02:47,573 --> 00:02:48,774
You know,

43
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:51,410
Should I try applying there once more?

44
00:02:52,011 --> 00:02:52,645
What?

45
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:55,815
The program's for women
returning after a career break.

46
00:02:55,815 --> 00:02:57,716
The age limit's 40,

47
00:02:57,716 --> 00:02:59,652
so if I apply now,
it's my last chance to...

48
00:02:59,652 --> 00:03:02,221
Why would you go there?
Who'd welcome you?

49
00:03:10,095 --> 00:03:11,197
I mean,

50
00:03:12,665 --> 00:03:16,202
have you already forgotten
how hard it was for you there?

51
00:03:16,202 --> 00:03:18,103
Why go back to that place?

52
00:03:18,103 --> 00:03:20,139
That's exactly why I want to go back.

53
00:03:20,573 --> 00:03:24,009
I left like I was running away.
I was embarrassed ever since.

54
00:03:24,009 --> 00:03:25,644
So isn't it natural...

55
00:03:25,644 --> 00:03:26,779
to want to make up for it?

56
00:03:27,146 --> 00:03:28,981
And it's a great opportunity as well.

57
00:03:32,351 --> 00:03:34,420
I get how you feel,

58
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,754
but you'd better find another place.

59
00:03:36,255 --> 00:03:37,590
They barely even hire anyone.

60
00:03:52,004 --> 00:03:53,706
I'm a 41-year-old office worker.

61
00:03:54,106 --> 00:03:57,309
My boyfriend's five years younger than me
and we've dated for about three years.

62
00:03:57,309 --> 00:03:58,944
Our chemistry is amazing,

63
00:03:58,944 --> 00:04:00,779
and our personalities really click.

64
00:04:00,779 --> 00:04:02,815
He's really someone I don't want to lose.

65
00:04:02,815 --> 00:04:05,718
So I started to think about marriage,

66
00:04:05,718 --> 00:04:08,154
but he's totally uninterested.

67
00:04:08,154 --> 00:04:10,356
He's a non-marriage type.

68
00:04:10,656 --> 00:04:12,057
I'm 41 now.

69
00:04:12,057 --> 00:04:14,126
Just dating with no thought of marriage...

70
00:04:14,126 --> 00:04:15,928
makes me worried.

71
00:04:15,928 --> 00:04:17,396
But if we break up,

72
00:04:17,396 --> 00:04:19,765
I don't think I'd ever meet
someone like him again.

73
00:04:19,765 --> 00:04:22,635
What should I do?

74
00:04:23,269 --> 00:04:25,638
It's such a sad story.

75
00:04:25,638 --> 00:04:27,573
Right. When a woman hits 40,

76
00:04:27,573 --> 00:04:29,875
she has complicated feelings.

77
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:31,911
You think about marriage and childbirth.

78
00:04:31,911 --> 00:04:34,747
It's a time when a sense of crisis
starts to creep in.

79
00:04:52,464 --> 00:04:53,732
Why aren't you texting?

80
00:04:53,732 --> 00:04:54,867
Are you that busy?

81
00:04:55,401 --> 00:04:57,369
What are you doing? Working?

82
00:04:58,337 --> 00:04:59,505
I'll call you later.

83
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:01,674
Aren't you even a little curious about me?

84
00:05:08,848 --> 00:05:12,117
Honestly, it's not like I was dying
to get married.

85
00:05:12,117 --> 00:05:15,087
But if he had proposed,
I wouldn't have said no, either.

86
00:05:15,087 --> 00:05:16,555
Still, this is just too much.

87
00:05:16,555 --> 00:05:17,756
Does he date me just to sleep with me?

88
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,962
(Photographer Eom)

89
00:05:24,563 --> 00:05:25,431
Hey.

90
00:05:25,731 --> 00:05:26,532
Are you busy?

91
00:05:27,099 --> 00:05:28,033
No.

92
00:05:28,467 --> 00:05:31,070
Really? Then lend me your laptop.

93
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:33,038
Mine keeps crashing for some reason.

94
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,374
No.

95
00:05:35,808 --> 00:05:36,675
What's wrong?

96
00:05:37,443 --> 00:05:38,244
Are you angry?

97
00:05:38,244 --> 00:05:39,912
Wouldn't you be angry if it were you?

98
00:05:40,646 --> 00:05:43,415
After three weeks of no contact,
you call, and that's all you say?

99
00:05:45,151 --> 00:05:46,886
Why are you treating me so badly?

100
00:05:47,386 --> 00:05:48,787
What did I do?

101
00:05:49,221 --> 00:05:50,422
It's not like we've just started dating.

102
00:05:50,422 --> 00:05:52,958
I just spoke casually because we're close.
Is that bad?

103
00:05:55,394 --> 00:05:56,262
So,

104
00:05:57,363 --> 00:05:58,297
you won't lend me?

105
00:05:59,498 --> 00:06:01,033
Fine, then.

106
00:06:02,201 --> 00:06:03,135
Wait.

107
00:06:04,036 --> 00:06:04,770
Il Ri.

108
00:06:05,037 --> 00:06:05,938
Yeah?

109
00:06:05,938 --> 00:06:08,174
Then bring me my Tom Brow cardigan too.

110
00:06:08,174 --> 00:06:10,075
The studio's kind of cold.

111
00:06:38,137 --> 00:06:39,171
Let's break up.

112
00:06:51,684 --> 00:06:53,352
I'm still paying this off.

113
00:07:02,228 --> 00:07:03,662
No texts, no nothing.

114
00:07:03,929 --> 00:07:05,498
So you really want to break up?

115
00:07:05,498 --> 00:07:07,867
Okay, fine.
I have no regrets, either.

116
00:07:15,007 --> 00:07:15,808
What is it?

117
00:07:16,909 --> 00:07:17,943
What are you hiding?

118
00:07:18,577 --> 00:07:19,845
Nothing.

119
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:24,817
Give it here.

120
00:07:25,885 --> 00:07:26,785
Now.

121
00:07:39,198 --> 00:07:40,166
Eom Jong Do.

122
00:07:40,866 --> 00:07:41,934
Let's break up.

123
00:07:46,238 --> 00:07:47,973
I'm still paying this off.

124
00:07:51,844 --> 00:07:53,279
Where did you get this?

125
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:58,083
Why did they record a video
without my permission?

126
00:07:59,051 --> 00:08:00,052
Actually...

127
00:08:00,719 --> 00:08:01,554
Why?

128
00:08:02,955 --> 00:08:03,722
What?

129
00:08:05,491 --> 00:08:07,159
Nothing.

130
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:09,161
Right, the no-look pass.

131
00:08:11,497 --> 00:08:12,998
You looked cool!
What's the big deal?

132
00:08:12,998 --> 00:08:14,567
It's not like they filmed it on purpose.

133
00:08:15,634 --> 00:08:18,938
And you guys.

134
00:08:18,938 --> 00:08:20,272
Learn from her.

135
00:08:20,573 --> 00:08:22,441
The passion of a fashion editor...

136
00:08:22,441 --> 00:08:25,044
trying to secure
a limited-edition luxury item.

137
00:08:26,645 --> 00:08:28,714
Isn't that beautiful?

138
00:08:28,714 --> 00:08:32,952
But Manager Eom called earlier.

139
00:08:34,487 --> 00:08:36,055
He was rambling.

140
00:08:36,388 --> 00:08:38,390
Maybe he's worried he'll get fired.

141
00:08:39,859 --> 00:08:41,694
Anyway, congratulations.

142
00:08:42,161 --> 00:08:44,630
Welcome back to the world
of infinite possibilities.

143
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,608
Honestly,

144
00:08:56,509 --> 00:08:58,344
that guy was a total loser.

145
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:00,813
He always wanted me to buy him things.

146
00:09:01,514 --> 00:09:02,815
Once he asked...

147
00:09:02,815 --> 00:09:05,518
for an Armani coat for Christmas.

148
00:09:05,518 --> 00:09:07,186
Guess what he got me?

149
00:09:07,186 --> 00:09:08,087
What?

150
00:09:08,087 --> 00:09:09,021
A game console.

151
00:09:09,021 --> 00:09:10,256
Is that his or mine?

152
00:09:10,256 --> 00:09:11,891
His, not mine.

153
00:09:12,691 --> 00:09:14,260
Whenever we went to a fancy restaurant,

154
00:09:15,127 --> 00:09:16,562
he kept running to the bathroom...

155
00:09:16,562 --> 00:09:18,998
until the meal was over.

156
00:09:19,465 --> 00:09:21,934
Who knows what he was doing there?

157
00:09:21,934 --> 00:09:23,669
I'd wait forever but he wouldn't come.

158
00:09:23,669 --> 00:09:26,639
So I'd end up paying myself every time.

159
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:28,040
Was I a walking wallet or what?

160
00:09:29,642 --> 00:09:31,944
Hey, at least have some snacks
while you drink.

161
00:09:31,944 --> 00:09:33,078
You'll ruin your stomach.

162
00:09:33,078 --> 00:09:34,280
How annoying.

163
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,082
I'm so annoyed I can't even eat.

164
00:09:37,082 --> 00:09:38,951
My pride hurts.

165
00:09:39,151 --> 00:09:42,221
I let a loser like that
drag me around for three years.

166
00:09:43,889 --> 00:09:45,591
I must've been insane.

167
00:09:45,591 --> 00:09:46,792
Totally insane.

168
00:09:47,259 --> 00:09:50,729
Lee Il Ri, you've finally
come to your senses.

169
00:09:50,729 --> 00:09:54,033
We told you so many times,
and you never listened.

170
00:09:54,033 --> 00:09:56,135
She said she couldn't give up
the "hot night."

171
00:09:56,135 --> 00:09:57,736
"Hot night," my foot.

172
00:09:57,736 --> 00:09:59,805
Do you know what Mark Twain said?

173
00:09:59,805 --> 00:10:01,640
He said the most insignificant thing...

174
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,310
humans mistake for important
are hot nights.

175
00:10:05,778 --> 00:10:06,679
Lee Il Ri.

176
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:08,280
I actually think this is for the best.

177
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,249
Honestly, what good did he do you?

178
00:10:10,249 --> 00:10:12,151
He used you like a wallet...

179
00:10:12,151 --> 00:10:14,520
and wasn't even sweet about it.

180
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,621
- Exactly.
- Yes.

181
00:10:15,621 --> 00:10:16,755
But...

182
00:10:17,656 --> 00:10:20,559
you married people don't get it.

183
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:21,560
What?

184
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,096
Among all the guys I've dated,

185
00:10:24,096 --> 00:10:26,599
he was the best in bed.

186
00:10:26,599 --> 00:10:29,902
I'll never meet someone like that again.

187
00:10:31,403 --> 00:10:35,174
He was perfect in every way.

188
00:10:35,808 --> 00:10:37,977
- Had I known...
- What's wrong with her?

189
00:10:37,977 --> 00:10:39,812
I would've been in bed with him more.

190
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:41,914
You guys have no idea...

191
00:10:41,914 --> 00:10:45,718
this feeling of loss I have.

192
00:10:45,718 --> 00:10:47,853
Just sleep.

193
00:10:47,853 --> 00:10:49,855
What a mess.

194
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:52,558
Is that really something
to be that desperate about?

195
00:11:02,968 --> 00:11:04,603
How's your job search going?

196
00:11:05,271 --> 00:11:07,406
I got rejected from all of them.

197
00:11:08,174 --> 00:11:10,543
You know what everyone says to me?

198
00:11:10,543 --> 00:11:11,977
My résumé's too impressive.

199
00:11:11,977 --> 00:11:13,379
I'm too old.

200
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:16,048
And even when I offered
to work for free, they still said no.

201
00:11:16,048 --> 00:11:17,283
My goodness. Really?

202
00:11:17,283 --> 00:11:18,284
Yes.

203
00:11:18,284 --> 00:11:20,886
Saying the market's flooded with
show hosts trying to build portfolios.

204
00:11:22,688 --> 00:11:25,057
My self-esteem's at rock bottom.

205
00:11:26,091 --> 00:11:27,092
Remember what I told you last time?

206
00:11:27,726 --> 00:11:30,629
I didn't want to look pathetic
in front of my landlady, Yang Mi Sook,

207
00:11:30,629 --> 00:11:33,365
so I lied and said I worked
at Sweet Home Shopping.

208
00:11:33,365 --> 00:11:35,000
So I tried applying somewhere...

209
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,769
just to make that lie true.

210
00:11:37,403 --> 00:11:38,971
But now I feel like
I'm turning into a total fraud.

211
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:44,143
But don't you want to go back
to Sweet Home Shopping?

212
00:11:45,878 --> 00:11:48,347
Who'd welcome me there?

213
00:11:49,048 --> 00:11:51,083
And honestly,

214
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:53,652
I'm scared I'll get rejected
and end up getting hurt again.

215
00:11:54,854 --> 00:11:56,188
You won't know until you try.

216
00:11:56,188 --> 00:11:57,323
You startled me.

217
00:11:57,323 --> 00:11:58,924
Why get scared before you even start?

218
00:11:59,692 --> 00:12:00,726
I thought you were sleeping.

219
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,495
I woke up.

220
00:12:04,763 --> 00:12:05,598
Hey.

221
00:12:06,298 --> 00:12:08,033
Just apply there.

222
00:12:08,033 --> 00:12:10,703
You said you got rejected
everywhere else anyway.

223
00:12:12,438 --> 00:12:14,874
Even if that's not the case,
I still think you should apply there.

224
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:16,609
Why?

225
00:12:16,809 --> 00:12:18,043
They say a wounded heart only heals...

226
00:12:18,043 --> 00:12:19,712
when you face it head-on.

227
00:12:20,646 --> 00:12:22,748
I get that you want to avoid it,

228
00:12:23,249 --> 00:12:24,350
but since you've already
worked up the courage,

229
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:26,352
charging forward might not be so bad.

230
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,221
Hey, clean this up.

231
00:12:29,221 --> 00:12:31,657
Why are you taking it away?
I'm still eating.

232
00:12:31,657 --> 00:12:34,126
Come on, let's go already.
Stop drinking.

233
00:12:34,126 --> 00:12:35,995
Hey, where's the fish cake soup?
Bring it here.

234
00:12:35,995 --> 00:12:37,096
It's cold now.

235
00:13:19,071 --> 00:13:20,406
Hello, I'm...

236
00:13:25,044 --> 00:13:26,111
Hello.

237
00:13:27,847 --> 00:13:31,016
I'm Cho Na Jeong,
a former show host at Sweet Home Shopping.

238
00:13:36,155 --> 00:13:37,556
Hello.

239
00:13:37,556 --> 00:13:41,026
I'm Cho Na Jeong,
a former show host at Sweet Home Shopping.

240
00:13:44,396 --> 00:13:46,999
When I was a working mom,

241
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,401
I was as fragile as a leaf...

242
00:13:53,272 --> 00:13:55,708
When I was a working mom,

243
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:58,944
I was as fragile as a leaf
that could crumble underfoot.

244
00:13:58,944 --> 00:14:01,847
Then later, as a full-time mom,

245
00:14:02,882 --> 00:14:05,317
I felt trapped in a murky,
stagnant reservoir.

246
00:14:05,317 --> 00:14:06,485
It felt endless.

247
00:14:06,685 --> 00:14:09,522
But those long, difficult times...

248
00:14:09,522 --> 00:14:12,057
became stepping stones for my growth.

249
00:14:15,761 --> 00:14:18,063
During six years of marriage,

250
00:14:18,531 --> 00:14:20,499
raising two children...

251
00:14:20,499 --> 00:14:22,601
gave me countless feelings
and experiences to draw from...

252
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:29,942
(Jungseok Full-Service Moving)

253
00:14:37,516 --> 00:14:38,684
Sorry.

254
00:15:05,444 --> 00:15:06,745
How buff.

255
00:15:07,313 --> 00:15:08,214
Is he single?

256
00:15:17,423 --> 00:15:18,224
This is the place.

257
00:15:18,824 --> 00:15:20,125
Deluxe Hanmaeum Motel.

258
00:15:21,193 --> 00:15:22,461
Next to the chicken noodle soup place.

259
00:15:23,362 --> 00:15:26,966
(Deluxe Hanmaeum Motel)

260
00:15:26,966 --> 00:15:27,700
Okay.

261
00:15:30,202 --> 00:15:31,804
Like I said yesterday,

262
00:15:31,804 --> 00:15:33,372
lunch break's only an hour,

263
00:15:33,372 --> 00:15:34,740
so get there first and wait.

264
00:15:35,474 --> 00:15:37,743
You won't be late this time, right?

265
00:15:37,743 --> 00:15:39,912
No way.
I even canceled my meetings.

266
00:15:42,081 --> 00:15:42,948
Good.

267
00:15:43,883 --> 00:15:45,117
Try to get there early,

268
00:15:45,618 --> 00:15:46,886
and be ready.

269
00:15:50,156 --> 00:15:51,123
Manager Gu.

270
00:15:51,423 --> 00:15:52,558
Yes.

271
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,296
For next April's
Back to the Classic showcase,

272
00:15:57,296 --> 00:15:59,098
we've shortlisted "Macbeth"
by Yeonhu Theater Company...

273
00:15:59,098 --> 00:16:01,233
and "Waiting for Godot"...

274
00:16:01,233 --> 00:16:02,735
by the acting troupe Butterfly Dance.

275
00:16:02,735 --> 00:16:04,270
For the May Spring Night Music Festival,

276
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:06,071
how about we push forward
a collaboration...

277
00:16:06,071 --> 00:16:09,675
between the Insan Symphony Orchestra
and pianist Kim Ja Young?

278
00:16:09,675 --> 00:16:10,709
Kim Ja Young?

279
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:14,947
She's too young and unproven, isn't she?

280
00:16:14,947 --> 00:16:18,050
Sir, Ja Young is ridiculous.

281
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:21,020
I've reviewed recent pianist profiles.

282
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,255
She's one of the strongest contenders...

283
00:16:23,255 --> 00:16:25,424
for this year's Chopin Competition.

284
00:16:25,424 --> 00:16:26,292
That's impressive.
Why not?

285
00:16:27,092 --> 00:16:30,529
Manager Shin,
you could learn a thing or two from her.

286
00:16:30,529 --> 00:16:32,164
Manager Gu's always thinking
several moves ahead.

287
00:16:33,299 --> 00:16:36,402
All right then,
prepare the festival like that.

288
00:16:37,736 --> 00:16:38,571
What about the plays?

289
00:16:39,104 --> 00:16:41,507
As for "Macbeth" and "Waiting for Godot,"

290
00:16:41,507 --> 00:16:43,776
since both have strong name recognition,

291
00:16:43,776 --> 00:16:45,845
we can expect high ticket sales.

292
00:16:52,184 --> 00:16:53,152
That scared me.

293
00:16:58,257 --> 00:17:00,759
Manager Gu, where shall we go for lunch?

294
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:03,762
Sorry, you all go ahead.

295
00:17:03,762 --> 00:17:04,964
I already have plans.

296
00:17:04,964 --> 00:17:05,865
Okay.

297
00:17:06,565 --> 00:17:10,202
We're such unimportant people.

298
00:17:10,202 --> 00:17:11,370
Don't even bother asking her.

299
00:17:12,972 --> 00:17:16,108
Now that I think about it,
she skipped the last company dinner too.

300
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:20,012
These days, she's even picky about
which company dinner she joins.

301
00:17:21,947 --> 00:17:23,949
I've got a long way to go to be like her.

302
00:17:24,183 --> 00:17:25,651
A long, long way.

303
00:17:25,651 --> 00:17:27,553
That's what working life's about, right?

304
00:17:29,321 --> 00:17:31,190
Manager Shin, why are you so interested...

305
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:33,325
in my whereabouts
that no one else even remembers?

306
00:17:34,393 --> 00:17:36,328
Anyone would think you're stalking me.

307
00:17:36,862 --> 00:17:37,696
Excuse me?

308
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,401
Yes?

309
00:17:43,636 --> 00:17:44,703
Chicken noodle soup?

310
00:17:47,339 --> 00:17:48,307
Yes, that sounds great.

311
00:17:49,542 --> 00:17:50,409
Where?

312
00:17:51,577 --> 00:17:53,179
Right next to Hanmaeum Motel?

313
00:17:54,013 --> 00:17:55,381
Okay, got it.

314
00:17:56,148 --> 00:17:57,016
Yes.

315
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,855
- Is this the place?
- Yes.

316
00:18:02,855 --> 00:18:03,656
I'm starving.

317
00:18:12,331 --> 00:18:13,499
Didn't you say
there's another good restaurant nearby?

318
00:18:13,499 --> 00:18:15,401
Yes, a new one opened just behind here.

319
00:18:15,401 --> 00:18:16,569
- Where?
- Over there.

320
00:18:17,937 --> 00:18:19,171
That looks good.

321
00:18:19,772 --> 00:18:21,607
- Let's go there tomorrow.
- Great.

00:19:46,692 --> 00:19:47,693
Is it raining outside?

No, it's sunny.

326
00:19:52,731 --> 00:19:53,599
Exactly.

327
00:19:59,805 --> 00:20:01,173
- Excuse me.
- Do you need a room?

328
00:20:01,941 --> 00:20:03,476
Someone's waiting for me upstairs.

329
00:20:07,813 --> 00:20:10,249
Hey, which room is it?

330
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,351
Tell me now.

331
00:20:12,351 --> 00:20:13,118
Well,

332
00:20:13,719 --> 00:20:14,720
you see, honey,

333
00:20:15,221 --> 00:20:18,123
I suddenly got indigestion.

334
00:20:19,325 --> 00:20:21,260
You bastard!

335
00:20:49,989 --> 00:20:50,856
Yes, sir.

336
00:20:51,357 --> 00:20:53,425
I tried to delay it somehow,

337
00:20:53,425 --> 00:20:55,261
but it looks like
I'll have to do it next year.

338
00:21:09,008 --> 00:21:10,309

Why didn't you tell me
you applied to Sweet Home Shopping?

Why do I have to hear it at work?

not Sweet Home Shopping.

Why exactly can't I apply there?

359

And what, if you say, "Don't do it,"

360
00:22:29,455 --> 00:22:31,123
am I just supposed to say
"Yes, sir" and listen?

00:23:15,634 --> 00:23:16,869
I'm sorry, honey.

366
00:23:16,869 --> 00:23:18,671
I was just about to leave earlier,

367
00:23:20,372 --> 00:23:23,209
but I suddenly felt nauseous and dizzy.

368
00:23:25,311 --> 00:23:27,546
If I'd gone,
I wouldn't have managed anyway.

369
00:23:27,546 --> 00:23:29,615
I'd only disappoint you again, so...

370
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:32,551
You must be really mad.

371
00:23:38,757 --> 00:23:39,692
Give me your glasses.

372
00:23:53,205 --> 00:23:54,139
Sang Min.

373
00:23:55,474 --> 00:23:56,442
Maybe...

374
00:23:57,476 --> 00:23:58,644
we should just stop trying for a baby.

375
00:24:01,981 --> 00:24:02,915
Honestly,

376
00:24:03,883 --> 00:24:05,084
because of my age,

377
00:24:06,252 --> 00:24:08,254
and because our parents keep waiting,

378
00:24:08,454 --> 00:24:10,156
I kept trying.

379
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:13,492
But if it's this hard for you,
we can stop.

380
00:24:18,898 --> 00:24:20,766
Fine. Then stop.

381
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,601
But...

382
00:24:24,537 --> 00:24:26,238
then are we going to live
like this forever?

383
00:24:27,807 --> 00:24:29,742
The reason I wanted to have a baby...

384
00:24:30,676 --> 00:24:33,846
wasn't only for the baby.
I thought it'd bring us closer too.

385
00:24:35,114 --> 00:24:36,382
So what I want to know is this.

386
00:24:37,216 --> 00:24:38,617
Do you not find me attractive anymore?

387
00:24:42,454 --> 00:24:43,889
No, it's not that.

388
00:24:44,723 --> 00:24:46,392
Then what is it?

389
00:24:46,892 --> 00:24:48,160
Tell me.

390
00:24:53,332 --> 00:24:56,368
Sorry, but I need to wash up.

391
00:24:57,236 --> 00:25:00,105
I still feel nauseous.
I need to lie down.

392
00:25:21,794 --> 00:25:22,795
So what,

393
00:25:22,795 --> 00:25:24,096
are you saying I'm selfish?

394
00:25:25,831 --> 00:25:28,167
Am I a failure as a mother?

395
00:25:28,734 --> 00:25:30,936
Because the kids are still young
and need me,

396
00:25:30,936 --> 00:25:32,304
but I keep wanting to work?

397
00:25:32,304 --> 00:25:33,606
Who said that?

398
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,441
But you know what?

399
00:25:36,175 --> 00:25:37,776
I'm 41 now.

400
00:25:38,043 --> 00:25:40,679
Even by international age,
it's an undeniable 40.

401
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:42,314
In a year or two,
even if I want to join somewhere,

402
00:25:42,314 --> 00:25:43,349
I absolutely won't be able to.

403
00:25:43,549 --> 00:25:44,850
"You're his mom, and you can't wait?"

404
00:25:45,584 --> 00:25:47,186
How could you say that to me?

405
00:25:47,753 --> 00:25:49,388
You know exactly how I've been living.

406
00:25:49,388 --> 00:25:51,090
How can you say something like that?

407
00:25:51,323 --> 00:25:53,325
For the six years since I married you,

408
00:25:53,325 --> 00:25:55,995
I practically lived in hospitals and ERs.

409
00:25:55,995 --> 00:25:58,164
I made our soap and detergent
with my own hands.

410
00:25:58,164 --> 00:25:59,565
That's enough.

411
00:26:00,733 --> 00:26:03,402
I studied just like you did,

412
00:26:03,402 --> 00:26:05,070
and I held down a normal job.

413
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,705
But ever since we got married,

414
00:26:06,705 --> 00:26:08,140
I'm the only one stuck in place.

415
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:10,810
Everyone else keeps running ahead,
and I'm the only one standing still.

416
00:26:12,011 --> 00:26:15,114
Do you know how miserable it feels
to fall behind day by day?

417
00:26:15,114 --> 00:26:17,016
Do you think anyone goes to work
because they love it?

418
00:26:18,717 --> 00:26:21,086
Everyone lives like that.

419
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,688
Fine.

420
00:26:23,455 --> 00:26:26,058
For you, work might be
a fancy self-fulfillment.

421
00:26:26,792 --> 00:26:28,994
But for me, work is the livelihood
of our family of four.

422
00:26:30,095 --> 00:26:31,964
And you think
we're worrying on the same level?

423
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:39,238
Is this who you really are?

424
00:26:39,572 --> 00:26:41,674
I'm telling you this is reality.

425
00:26:59,625 --> 00:27:01,160
Hello, ma'am.

426
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,162
- Listen to your teacher.
- Go on in.

427
00:27:03,162 --> 00:27:04,964
See you this evening.

428
00:27:04,964 --> 00:27:05,865
Go in.

429
00:27:05,865 --> 00:27:06,932
Thank you.

430
00:27:06,932 --> 00:27:08,801
- Min Woo, Min Jun, hi.
- Hello.

431
00:27:08,801 --> 00:27:09,768
Hello.

432
00:27:11,337 --> 00:27:12,938
Have fun, my little princes.

433
00:27:13,372 --> 00:27:14,740
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye.

434
00:27:21,714 --> 00:27:23,415
(A parent observation class will be held.)

435
00:27:23,415 --> 00:27:24,750
(July 21, 11:00 a.m.)

436
00:27:28,954 --> 00:27:30,222
(Sweet Home Shopping
2nd-round Interview Notice)

437
00:27:30,222 --> 00:27:31,390
(July 21, 11:00 a.m.)

438
00:27:33,459 --> 00:27:34,994
(July 21, 11:00 a.m.)

439
00:27:35,561 --> 00:27:39,431
(July 21, 11:00 a.m.
Please arrive 20 minutes early.)

440
00:27:45,604 --> 00:27:47,006
Gorgeous.

441
00:27:47,006 --> 00:27:47,740
Yes, that's good.

442
00:27:48,474 --> 00:27:50,309
Cute. Nice.

443
00:27:51,277 --> 00:27:52,044
Good.

444
00:27:53,112 --> 00:27:54,013
Beautiful.

445
00:27:54,013 --> 00:27:55,014
Nice.

446
00:27:55,915 --> 00:27:57,316
Look at the flower. Nice.

447
00:27:57,783 --> 00:27:58,884
Cute.

448
00:27:59,852 --> 00:28:01,720
Nice, very nice.

449
00:28:02,988 --> 00:28:03,923
Show me sexy.

450
00:28:05,791 --> 00:28:07,793
That's sexy.

451
00:28:09,628 --> 00:28:11,063
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

452
00:28:12,631 --> 00:28:14,066
I can't even.

453
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,269
What CEO asks to run her own pictorial
in her own magazine?

454
00:28:18,137 --> 00:28:19,305
Well, what can we do?

455
00:28:19,305 --> 00:28:22,408
If we want our paycheck,
we just have to grovel.

456
00:28:22,408 --> 00:28:24,076
Okay. All right, good.

457
00:28:27,546 --> 00:28:28,547
Okay, let's keep going.

458
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:32,685
You two still haven't made up?

459
00:28:33,552 --> 00:28:35,254
What are you talking about?
We're over.

460
00:28:36,088 --> 00:28:38,090
Come on.
Judging by Manager Eom today,

461
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:41,126
he looks like he wants you
to start a conversation.

462
00:28:41,126 --> 00:28:43,963
Exactly.
He keeps sneaking glances even now.

463
00:28:45,064 --> 00:28:46,098
Okay, just a little more.

464
00:28:47,967 --> 00:28:49,101
Come on.

465
00:28:49,101 --> 00:28:51,237
You go first and break the ice.

466
00:28:51,237 --> 00:28:53,572
In times like this, the dumper
should be the one to approach first.

467
00:28:54,206 --> 00:28:55,307
- Go!
- Go!

468
00:28:55,307 --> 00:28:56,942
Go!

469
00:28:56,942 --> 00:28:58,944
- We'll...
- Leave!

470
00:29:07,253 --> 00:29:08,821
- We'll check and continue.
- Okay.

471
00:29:28,707 --> 00:29:30,209
Isn't it gorgeous?

472
00:29:30,209 --> 00:29:32,978
Manager, what filter did you use here?

473
00:29:32,978 --> 00:29:34,547
It's a new filter that just came out.

474
00:29:34,547 --> 00:29:35,748
Let's keep it between us.

475
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:37,650
- Shush.
- Yes.

476
00:29:38,617 --> 00:29:40,553
Good, very good.

477
00:29:40,786 --> 00:29:42,488
I'm going to post this
right away after this,

478
00:29:42,488 --> 00:29:44,490
so while I'm being interviewed,
can you write the caption?

479
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:46,258
Okay.

480
00:29:54,033 --> 00:29:54,900
What?

481
00:29:56,202 --> 00:29:57,703
What is this?

482
00:29:59,905 --> 00:30:00,840
Is this...

483
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,641
Is this really me?

484
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:03,876
My gosh.

485
00:30:05,044 --> 00:30:06,712
I don't look like this.

486
00:30:07,813 --> 00:30:09,081
Why do I look so fat?

487
00:30:11,116 --> 00:30:13,352
What the.

488
00:30:13,352 --> 00:30:15,488
Why would you shoot the photo like this?

489
00:30:15,488 --> 00:30:16,689
Are you serious?

490
00:30:18,157 --> 00:30:20,259
- Manager, bring me your phone.
- Yes?

491
00:30:21,927 --> 00:30:22,728
Here.

492
00:30:23,596 --> 00:30:24,864
Look at this.

493
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:25,865
Beautiful.

494
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:27,399
This one looks so pretty,

495
00:30:28,601 --> 00:30:31,136
so why do I look so wide here?

496
00:30:31,904 --> 00:30:33,873
That one has a filter on it.

497
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:35,040
No.

498
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,309
It only tweaked the color.
The photo's the same.

499
00:30:43,382 --> 00:30:44,416
Manager, what is this?

500
00:30:45,384 --> 00:30:47,653
You're way worse at taking photos
than my manager.

501
00:30:49,221 --> 00:30:51,624
This one's prettier.
What are you talking about?

502
00:30:51,624 --> 00:30:53,025
And photos that go to print...

503
00:30:53,025 --> 00:30:55,461
look tacky if you retouch them like that.

504
00:31:02,268 --> 00:31:03,169
True.

505
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:04,470
Yes.

506
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:05,838
That wouldn't work.

507
00:31:06,772 --> 00:31:09,341
Deputy Editor,
you sound pretty professional today.

508
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:12,444
I like it.

509
00:31:19,819 --> 00:31:21,187
Do it like this.

510
00:31:21,187 --> 00:31:22,721
And like this.

511
00:31:23,222 --> 00:31:24,690
Hey, what are you doing?

512
00:31:27,026 --> 00:31:28,093
Like this.

513
00:31:28,093 --> 00:31:29,795
No, if you do it like this...

514
00:31:30,896 --> 00:31:31,764
That's it.

515
00:31:34,133 --> 00:31:35,267
Mom, for you.

516
00:31:37,269 --> 00:31:38,404
Thanks.

517
00:31:38,404 --> 00:31:39,839
Mom, for you.

518
00:31:40,306 --> 00:31:41,207
Thanks.

519
00:31:44,844 --> 00:31:46,846
Okay, thanks.

520
00:31:50,916 --> 00:31:52,418
Let's make a cat.

521
00:31:52,418 --> 00:31:53,152
Okay.

522
00:31:57,089 --> 00:31:58,157
Okay, last one.

523
00:31:59,825 --> 00:32:01,260
Great work.

524
00:32:04,029 --> 00:32:05,998
Good job.

525
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,434
Thank you for your work.

526
00:32:17,009 --> 00:32:17,943
Good job today.

527
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:23,682
- Thank you.
- Nice work.

528
00:32:23,682 --> 00:32:24,950
Are you posting a Reels after this too?

529
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:26,218
How did you know?

530
00:32:29,021 --> 00:32:30,389
I'm heading out.
See you tomorrow.

531
00:32:30,389 --> 00:32:31,690
See you tomorrow.

532
00:32:32,925 --> 00:32:33,893
What?

533
00:32:33,893 --> 00:32:36,295
Being childish and overacting
on purpose so I see it?

534
00:32:59,552 --> 00:33:00,452
Hey.

535
00:33:01,287 --> 00:33:02,755
You're dragging it out this time.

536
00:33:04,356 --> 00:33:06,759
So what?
You want to end it like this?

537
00:33:09,929 --> 00:33:11,297
You sure can hold a grudge.

538
00:33:12,264 --> 00:33:14,500
Fine. I'm sorry.

539
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,570
But you need to stop ignoring texts too.

540
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:19,772
Do you know how much
that pisses me off?

541
00:33:20,973 --> 00:33:22,441
Il Ri, let's not be like this.

542
00:33:27,513 --> 00:33:29,582
We said we'd be cool
no matter how or when it ends.

543
00:33:30,082 --> 00:33:31,183
No clinging.

544
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:19,131
Everyone.

545
00:34:19,131 --> 00:34:22,201
Are you just going to brush
three times a day the usual way?

546
00:34:22,434 --> 00:34:25,538
A micro-bristle toothbrush
that also cares for your gums.

547
00:34:25,538 --> 00:34:27,907
It's no longer optional, but essential.

548
00:34:28,874 --> 00:34:30,342
Micro-bristle toothbrush.

549
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:33,312
Micro-bristle toothbrush.

550
00:34:34,814 --> 00:34:36,715
Is there a styling you want?

551
00:34:37,483 --> 00:34:38,684
If you roll it like this,

552
00:34:38,684 --> 00:34:41,787
you can handle any styling you like.

553
00:34:47,026 --> 00:34:48,327
Mom, what are you doing?

554
00:34:49,028 --> 00:34:49,829
Well...

555
00:34:56,535 --> 00:34:57,970
Hello, everyone.

556
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,638
The product I'm introducing today...

557
00:35:00,472 --> 00:35:02,408
is this little one.

558
00:35:03,008 --> 00:35:05,911
For those with severe inner dryness,

559
00:35:05,911 --> 00:35:07,179
I strongly recommend this.

560
00:35:15,087 --> 00:35:16,956
For tomorrow's open class,

561
00:35:16,956 --> 00:35:18,557
should we at least bring snacks?

562
00:35:18,557 --> 00:35:21,427
It's our kids' first open class this year.

563
00:35:21,427 --> 00:35:23,028
How about simple snacks?

564
00:35:24,263 --> 00:35:26,398
Is there anything special
we should prepare?

565
00:35:26,398 --> 00:35:27,666
It's my first time, so I don't know.

566
00:35:27,666 --> 00:35:29,768
I'm so excited to see our kids sing.

567
00:35:33,672 --> 00:35:36,442
I have an interview tomorrow at 11...

568
00:35:36,442 --> 00:35:41,213
(Min Woo, Min Jun's Kindergarten)

569
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:10,342
Aren't you getting on?

570
00:36:10,342 --> 00:36:11,343
You go ahead.

571
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,074
Yes, ma'am?

572
00:36:43,442 --> 00:36:44,243
What?

573
00:36:51,684 --> 00:36:53,953
He suddenly threw up after a snack,

574
00:36:53,953 --> 00:36:56,222
and he was burning up with a fever.

575
00:36:56,222 --> 00:36:59,492
A lot of kids haven't been coming
because of the flu lately,

576
00:36:59,492 --> 00:37:01,227
and I think Min Woo caught it too.

577
00:37:01,227 --> 00:37:02,962
Mom, why are you crying?

578
00:37:03,762 --> 00:37:05,998
Are you upset I couldn't sing?

579
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:08,300
No.

580
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:11,470
I'm upset because you're sick, Min Woo.

581
00:37:12,371 --> 00:37:13,706
Sorry, Mom.

582
00:37:15,808 --> 00:37:16,976
No, it's okay.

583
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:27,319
(Bambino Pediatrics)

584
00:38:16,569 --> 00:38:18,170
Don't be too discouraged.

585
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:21,474
You never know when and how
another opportunity will come.

586
00:38:22,007 --> 00:38:23,375
If you wait a little,

587
00:38:23,375 --> 00:38:25,311
a much better position
might open up, right?

588
00:38:27,379 --> 00:38:28,614
I'm not sure.

589
00:38:28,614 --> 00:38:31,016
Maybe I'm fated to live and die like this.

590
00:38:31,717 --> 00:38:33,385
Are you going to drink that go wild again?

591
00:38:35,221 --> 00:38:36,655
I can't sleep at all these days.

592
00:38:36,655 --> 00:38:39,425
If I drink this, maybe I can sleep.

593
00:38:41,427 --> 00:38:43,162
No need to watch
my figure anymore, anyway.

594
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,004
But why was your husband
so strongly against it?

595
00:38:52,004 --> 00:38:53,172
Exactly.

596
00:38:53,172 --> 00:38:55,107
I mean, sure, he can disagree.

597
00:38:55,107 --> 00:38:56,742
But it went beyond that.

598
00:38:56,742 --> 00:38:58,477
He snapped.

599
00:38:58,477 --> 00:39:00,012
How annoying.

600
00:39:00,012 --> 00:39:01,447
I don't even want to talk to him.

601
00:39:01,447 --> 00:39:03,349
That's how they all are.

602
00:39:03,349 --> 00:39:05,151
They tell you, "Go ahead and work."

603
00:39:05,151 --> 00:39:06,452
But the moment their wife actually does,

604
00:39:06,452 --> 00:39:08,254
"Work, but you take care of the kid."

605
00:39:08,254 --> 00:39:09,188
They're always like this.

606
00:39:09,788 --> 00:39:11,157
They want a double income,

607
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:13,092
but they hate sharing housework.

608
00:39:13,626 --> 00:39:15,261
Was your husband like that too?

609
00:39:15,261 --> 00:39:16,362
Totally.

610
00:39:16,829 --> 00:39:19,698
When I went back to work
three months after my first baby,

611
00:39:20,933 --> 00:39:23,068
he didn't even do anything at home.

612
00:39:23,068 --> 00:39:24,203
My goodness.

613
00:39:24,203 --> 00:39:25,604
Thinking back now,

614
00:39:26,505 --> 00:39:27,940
I should've gotten a divorce then.

615
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,743
So how did you end up
having the youngest after that?

616
00:39:33,345 --> 00:39:34,180
Right away?

617
00:39:36,515 --> 00:39:39,018
- You're unbelievable.
- Darn it.

618
00:39:39,018 --> 00:39:42,254
These days, I don't know why
I keep spilling everything I eat.

619
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:44,089
My goodness.

620
00:39:44,089 --> 00:39:45,291
- Did you wipe it all?
- Yes.

621
00:39:46,058 --> 00:39:48,027
Right, didn't you say
you had a discount coupon?

622
00:39:48,027 --> 00:39:49,061
I have one.

623
00:39:54,967 --> 00:39:57,336
Wait, what?

624
00:39:57,803 --> 00:39:58,671
Why?

625
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:00,873
The second interview...

626
00:40:01,407 --> 00:40:02,675
got postponed.

627
00:40:03,576 --> 00:40:04,810
What do you mean?

628
00:40:05,244 --> 00:40:07,379
Apparently, the executives
had an emergency meeting,

629
00:40:08,113 --> 00:40:10,316
and they moved the interview date.

630
00:40:10,816 --> 00:40:11,784
Really?

631
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:12,885
Then when is it?

632
00:40:14,987 --> 00:40:17,022
Today, at two.

633
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:19,124
Today at two?

634
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:24,230
Hey, it's fine.

635
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,931
You still have an hour.
You'll make it.

636
00:40:27,333 --> 00:40:29,835
But what do we do with that stain?

637
00:40:34,607 --> 00:40:37,243
What do you mean, "What do we do?"
I can't go, that's what.

638
00:40:46,085 --> 00:40:46,852
Hey.

00:40:47,686 --> 00:40:48,420

Hey, stop eating.

642
00:40:54,527 --> 00:40:56,328
Stop. You have to go now.

643
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:57,930
You only have an hour left.
Let's go now.

644
00:40:57,930 --> 00:40:58,697
Come on.

645
00:40:58,697 --> 00:41:01,634
I'll watch the kids.

646
00:41:01,634 --> 00:41:04,637
Just go already.
What are you doing?

647
00:41:04,637 --> 00:41:07,139
What are you planning to do?

00:41:07,139 --> 00:41:09,408
Hey, your face...

649
00:41:09,408 --> 00:41:10,209
What's wrong with you, Cho Na Jeong?

650
00:41:10,209 --> 00:41:13,345
Snap out of it, Cho Na Jeong.

651
00:41:15,881 --> 00:41:16,916
Hey, Cho Na Jeong!

652
00:41:18,717 --> 00:41:19,351
Hey.

653
00:41:19,885 --> 00:41:21,020

Cho Na Jeong!

656
00:41:26,125 --> 00:41:28,294
Hey, take this.

657
00:41:28,294 --> 00:41:29,895
There's makeup and my wallet.

658
00:41:29,895 --> 00:41:30,996
Thank you.

659
00:41:30,996 --> 00:41:32,198
You got this. Go now.

660
00:41:33,732 --> 00:41:35,534
Cho Na Jeong, good luck.

661
00:41:50,082 --> 00:41:52,084
I have no choice.
I'll just call it a concept.

Hey.

Ye Na.

667
00:42:20,646 --> 00:42:23,849
You applied here too?

668
00:42:23,849 --> 00:42:24,884
Well,

669
00:42:25,484 --> 00:42:27,486
that's what happened.

670
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:30,022
But...

671
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:32,391
your outfit's a bit...

672
00:42:33,459 --> 00:42:34,527
Actually,

673
00:42:35,361 --> 00:42:38,797
remember my friend
who's a deputy editor at N Life Magazine?

674
00:42:38,797 --> 00:42:42,034
She said the color trend
for next year's S/S season...

675
00:42:42,034 --> 00:42:43,903
are purple and green,

676
00:42:43,903 --> 00:42:46,438
so I went bold with those two.

677
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:47,907
Maybe too bold.

678
00:42:47,907 --> 00:42:49,074
I'm always ahead of the curve.

679
00:42:49,074 --> 00:42:51,844

688
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:18,637
They say she made a ton of money
doing live commerce streams.

689
00:43:19,338 --> 00:43:21,474
Even someone like that
came to take our spots.

to her own platform?

You lied like no one would ever find out.

698
00:43:39,692 --> 00:43:42,661
What, you hated working with me that much?

699
00:43:43,562 --> 00:43:45,631
No, it's not like that.

700
00:43:47,466 --> 00:43:48,467
But what about you?

701
00:43:48,801 --> 00:43:49,935
Why are you here?

702
00:43:50,202 --> 00:43:51,537
You said you're a famous show host.

Well, that's the minor league,
and this is the majors.

- You too, Na Jeong.
- Thanks.

00:44:37,249 --> 00:44:39,585
Your kid's burning up with a fever.

717
00:44:40,085 --> 00:44:41,287
You didn't know?

718
00:44:41,287 --> 00:44:43,255
But he was fine this morning.

719
00:44:43,255 --> 00:44:44,456
How high is it?

720
00:44:44,456 --> 00:44:46,892
Over 39 degrees.

721
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:49,795
He's shivering all over.

722
00:44:49,795 --> 00:44:52,998
If he has a seizure, it could be serious.

723
00:44:53,766 --> 00:44:55,901
Could you please come back, even now?

724
00:44:55,901 --> 00:44:57,169
Ma'am, I'm really sorry.

00:44:57,169 --> 00:44:59,038
- I'll call you again.
- I'm just so scared.

Are you trying to drive me crazy or what?

730
00:45:14,453 --> 00:45:15,354
You act like this,

731
00:45:15,354 --> 00:45:17,189
so it's no wonder
nobody wants to work with moms.

732
00:45:17,189 --> 00:45:17,990
I'm sorry.

733
00:45:27,333 --> 00:45:28,367
Don't take it, Cho Na Jeong.

734
00:45:28,901 --> 00:45:30,336
If you pick up, it's over.

735
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:33,172
Once you're at work, forget your kid.

736
00:45:33,172 --> 00:45:35,508
If you're going to let your kid drag you
around, you shouldn't be working at all.

(Babysitter)

738
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:39,812
I warned you.

739
00:45:40,846 --> 00:45:41,714
If you take that call,

740
00:45:42,381 --> 00:45:43,282
you're out.

741
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:52,324
I'm sorry.

742
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:57,429

- Ms. Cho.

743
00:45:57,930 --> 00:46:00,466
Min Woo's having a seizure.

744
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:16,081
The waistline's slim, the silhouette...

745
00:46:20,452 --> 00:46:21,253
Comfortable...

746
00:46:21,253 --> 00:46:24,490
Applicants number 998 and 740,
please get ready.

747

please get ready.

Applicants number 920 and 517,
please get ready.

749
00:46:46,445 --> 00:46:48,113
There are four colors,

750
00:46:48,113 --> 00:46:50,282
and we've prepared a wide range of sizes.

751
00:46:50,282 --> 00:46:52,284
(Open Recruitment Interview
for Career Re-entry Applicants)

752
00:46:52,284 --> 00:46:56,722
Applicants number 987 and 1080,
please get ready.

753
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:08,467
Let's fight fair and square, Cho Na Jeong.

754
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:10,936
You might've gone to a better school,

755
00:47:10,936 --> 00:47:12,238
but I've got more fight in me.

(Interview Room)

757
00:47:35,961 --> 00:47:36,795
Please have a seat.

758
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:43,936
Ms. Yang Mi Sook,

759
00:47:45,037 --> 00:47:46,906
also known as Dorabangs?

760
00:47:50,442 --> 00:47:51,911
Dorabangs, it's unexpected you're here.

761
00:47:52,611 --> 00:47:54,780
You're already running
your own live commerce channel.

762
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:56,715
So why apply here?

763
00:47:57,850 --> 00:47:58,851
Yes, that's right.

764
00:47:59,151 --> 00:48:02,354
I'm a mobile show host
with some name recognition,

765
00:48:02,354 --> 00:48:04,723
and my business is still expanding.

766
00:48:04,723 --> 00:48:05,691
However,

767
00:48:05,691 --> 00:48:07,393
I felt my overflowing talent...

768
00:48:07,393 --> 00:48:10,296
was too great to contain
within my own channel alone.

769
00:48:10,296 --> 00:48:13,065
To leverage the know-how I've built
from running live broadcasts,

770
00:48:13,065 --> 00:48:14,667
work together with Sweet Home Shopping,

771
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:18,137
and tap into the rapidly growing
live commerce market,

772
00:48:18,137 --> 00:48:20,172
I applied to Sweet Home Shopping.

773
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,341
You're not just switching over...

774
00:48:22,341 --> 00:48:24,176
because live commerce
got too hard, are you?

775
00:48:25,711 --> 00:48:27,480
I've heard personal stream sales...

776
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:28,948
are just shiny on the outside.

777
00:48:29,548 --> 00:48:31,784
Of course, it's not easy.

778
00:48:31,784 --> 00:48:32,618
But...

779
00:48:32,885 --> 00:48:35,421
I survived in that tough market.

780
00:48:36,188 --> 00:48:38,991
I've done five-hour live streams
with 1,000 concurrent viewers,

781
00:48:38,991 --> 00:48:42,161
and sold more than 1,000 items
in a single session.

782
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:44,063
In terms of skill and experience,

783
00:48:44,063 --> 00:48:46,165
I don't think I'm behind anyone.

784
00:48:49,001 --> 00:48:51,604
But both of you have kids, right?

785
00:48:51,604 --> 00:48:52,605
Who looks after them?

786
00:48:53,272 --> 00:48:55,074
We often have early-morning broadcasts,

787
00:48:55,074 --> 00:48:56,475
and unpredictable hours.

788
00:48:59,111 --> 00:48:59,912
I...

789
00:49:00,779 --> 00:49:03,282
have a live-in caregiver, so it's fine.

790
00:49:07,153 --> 00:49:09,188
Your kids don't cause trouble
these days, right?

791
00:49:11,357 --> 00:49:12,158
Yes.

792
00:49:12,892 --> 00:49:14,527
I apologize again about that incident.

793
00:49:16,362 --> 00:49:17,863
Then let's get right to it.

794
00:49:19,732 --> 00:49:21,700
You all know how this test works, right?

795
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:23,035
It's a blind test.

796
00:49:23,702 --> 00:49:25,304
You'll see a product appear
on the screen behind you,

797
00:49:25,304 --> 00:49:27,540
and you'll sell it
as if you're on a live broadcast.

798
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:28,474
If...

799
00:49:30,309 --> 00:49:31,944
I decide to buy the product,

800
00:49:31,944 --> 00:49:35,548
that person automatically
passes this round.

(Sweet Hotel Stay Package
700 dollars)

802
00:49:48,627 --> 00:49:51,931
(Sweet Hotel Stay Package
700 dollars)

803
00:50:04,243 --> 00:50:05,678
Hello, everyone.

804
00:50:05,678 --> 00:50:07,146
Today we've prepared for you...

805
00:50:07,146 --> 00:50:10,249
a one-night stay at the Sweet Hotel
with a limousine ride,

806
00:50:10,249 --> 00:50:13,886
plus tickets to the famous
Sweet Hotel show.

807
00:50:13,886 --> 00:50:17,089
A package never before seen
in home shopping history.

808
00:50:17,089 --> 00:50:19,558
I can already feel the customers' eyes...

809
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:21,460
widening with excitement.

810
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:24,763
From Hunan, China, user "I'llTakeThis"...

811
00:50:24,763 --> 00:50:26,866
has shared that they're planning a trip
to Korea early next year...

812
00:50:26,866 --> 00:50:28,701
and already expressed interest
in buying this product.

813
00:50:28,701 --> 00:50:29,702
That's right.

814
00:50:29,702 --> 00:50:32,037
If you miss this timing,
this price, this package,

815
00:50:32,037 --> 00:50:33,806
the cost will go up.

816
00:50:33,806 --> 00:50:35,274
I hope you all can take advantage...

817
00:50:35,274 --> 00:50:37,610
of this deal while the broadcast lasts.

818
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:39,445
And we've also prepared...

819
00:50:40,045 --> 00:50:41,747
a special giveaway.

820
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:43,816
A truly incredible giveaway.

821
00:50:43,816 --> 00:50:47,253
A dinner at the Sweet Hotel restaurant.

822
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:56,428
Na Jeong, why leave a child...

823
00:50:56,862 --> 00:50:58,063
unattended at a restaurant?

824
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:05,004
For you, work might be
a fancy self-fulfillment.

825
00:51:05,004 --> 00:51:06,872
But for me, work is the livelihood
of our family of four.

826
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:08,974
Why would you go back there?

827
00:51:08,974 --> 00:51:10,476
Who'd welcome you?

828
00:51:10,476 --> 00:51:11,477
Ms. Cho Na Jeong.

829
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:24,657
Everyone.

830
00:51:25,391 --> 00:51:26,892
How many times...

831
00:51:26,892 --> 00:51:29,962
in your life have you ridden in a car...

832
00:51:29,962 --> 00:51:31,363
where someone
politely opened the door for you?

833
00:51:32,898 --> 00:51:36,635
Realistically,
unless we're a president or a minister,

834
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:39,104
it's rare to have someone...

835
00:51:39,104 --> 00:51:40,973
open a car door for us.

836
00:51:40,973 --> 00:51:42,408
Maybe it'll never happen in your lifetime.

837
00:51:43,275 --> 00:51:44,910
But does that mean...

838
00:51:45,277 --> 00:51:48,314
we don't deserve to be treated like VIPs?

839
00:51:49,281 --> 00:51:50,149
Of course not.

840
00:51:50,716 --> 00:51:52,918
Think of your parents.

841
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:56,722
Your father who works hard...

842
00:51:56,989 --> 00:51:58,991
from dawn until late at night,

843
00:51:59,992 --> 00:52:01,827
and your mother...

844
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:04,096
who cares for you day and night, 24/7.

845
00:52:04,864 --> 00:52:06,632
We all feel it, don't we?

846
00:52:07,333 --> 00:52:08,834
That lump in our throats...

847
00:52:09,902 --> 00:52:12,438
just thinking of our parents.

848
00:52:13,372 --> 00:52:14,373
Then,

849
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:16,976
have you ever...

850
00:52:16,976 --> 00:52:20,246
opened a car door for your parents?

851
00:52:24,650 --> 00:52:27,419
My father was a welder.

852
00:52:41,267 --> 00:52:42,368
Na Jeong.

853
00:52:44,637 --> 00:52:45,638
Hey, Na Jeong.

854
00:52:47,106 --> 00:52:49,074
Hey, why did you just walk away
when I called you?

855
00:52:50,376 --> 00:52:51,310
Just.

856
00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:54,914
Because he was the one person
who truly believed in and understood me,

857
00:52:54,914 --> 00:52:57,583
I still miss him so much.

858
00:52:58,284 --> 00:53:01,287
He worked long, hard hours
from dawn until night.

859
00:53:02,321 --> 00:53:04,490
And he passed away
in an unexpected accident...

860
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:07,059
at the work site when I was 13.

861
00:53:08,594 --> 00:53:09,395
So,

862
00:53:10,129 --> 00:53:12,264
if my father were still alive today,

863
00:53:13,165 --> 00:53:14,400
I'd want to tell him...

864
00:53:15,534 --> 00:53:18,270
thank you,

865
00:53:18,704 --> 00:53:20,306
and that he made me really happy.

866
00:53:21,607 --> 00:53:22,575
But now,

867
00:53:23,209 --> 00:53:24,610
it's too late.

868
00:53:29,315 --> 00:53:30,382
Dear customers,

869
00:53:31,517 --> 00:53:34,253
if I could take my father
on this limousine ride,

870
00:53:35,354 --> 00:53:37,590
I wouldn't hesitate to pay
not 700 dollars,

871
00:53:38,524 --> 00:53:42,161
but 7,000 or even 70,000 dollars.

872
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:45,698
Of course, the hotel stay is great,

873
00:53:45,698 --> 00:53:47,500
and the show tickets are wonderful too.

874
00:53:48,534 --> 00:53:52,104
But what about gifting your parents...

875
00:53:52,104 --> 00:53:54,106
this one precious minute...

876
00:53:54,106 --> 00:53:56,609
of riding in a limousine...

877
00:53:57,676 --> 00:54:00,913
from the hotel to the show?

878
00:54:10,623 --> 00:54:11,657
Ms. Yang Mi Sook.

879
00:54:12,658 --> 00:54:13,526
Yes?

880
00:54:15,461 --> 00:54:16,428
Seven hundred dollars.

881
00:54:17,863 --> 00:54:19,932
Paying all that at once is a bit heavy.

882
00:54:19,932 --> 00:54:21,167
Are there installment options?

883
00:54:22,635 --> 00:54:25,204
What's great about home shopping,
dear customer?

884
00:54:25,204 --> 00:54:27,173
Of course,
it's interest-free for 24 months,

885
00:54:27,173 --> 00:54:29,909
and you can pay
about 29 dollars a month...

886
00:54:29,909 --> 00:54:32,778
to get this product easily and economically.

887
00:54:34,413 --> 00:54:36,115
Ms. Yang, you're quick on the math...

888
00:54:36,782 --> 00:54:38,284
and great at thinking on your feet.

889
00:54:41,353 --> 00:54:42,288
But...

890
00:54:42,488 --> 00:54:44,824
when it comes to storytelling,
Ms. Cho has got the edge.

891
00:54:46,492 --> 00:54:47,560
One minute from both of you.

892
00:54:48,661 --> 00:54:49,562
I'll...

893
00:54:51,297 --> 00:54:52,231
buy them all.

894
00:55:15,287 --> 00:55:16,455
Hey, Jjon Na Jeong.

895
00:55:16,989 --> 00:55:20,025
Did you talk about your parents
to pull a tear-jerking stunt?

896
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:22,361
You're just as annoying as ever.

897
00:55:22,361 --> 00:55:23,996
What did you just say?

898
00:55:28,868 --> 00:55:30,102
See you again, my friend.

899
00:55:30,302 --> 00:55:31,136
Bye.

900
00:55:33,439 --> 00:55:34,173
Cho Na Jeong.

901
00:55:35,207 --> 00:55:36,609
You haven't lost your touch.

902
00:55:37,343 --> 00:55:38,544
Thank you, Executive Director.

903
00:55:39,145 --> 00:55:40,746
Emotional marketing, I see.

904
00:55:44,917 --> 00:55:45,818
But you.

905
00:55:46,785 --> 00:55:48,654
Even if you've gained weight,

906
00:55:49,421 --> 00:55:50,422
what's with that outfit?

907
00:55:54,126 --> 00:55:56,595
Lose some weight and pretty yourself up...

908
00:55:56,595 --> 00:55:57,830
for the final round.

909
00:55:58,631 --> 00:55:59,532
I will.

910
00:56:13,679 --> 00:56:14,780
(Min Woo, Min Jun's Mom)

911
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:19,552
- The number you've dialed is unavailable.
- Seriously?

912
00:56:22,021 --> 00:56:23,656
Yes!

913
00:56:29,428 --> 00:56:31,297
(Min Woo, Min Jun's Mom)

914
00:56:43,809 --> 00:56:45,244
The number you've dialed is unavailable.

915
00:56:45,244 --> 00:56:47,513
Why won't he pick up?

916
00:56:47,513 --> 00:56:49,648
I have to tell him this news right away.

917
00:56:55,387 --> 00:56:59,959
(2005
Na Jeong's Birthday 2)

918
00:57:00,192 --> 00:57:01,994
- You know what?
- What?

919
00:57:01,994 --> 00:57:05,164
I want to live a great life
doing my own thing.

920
00:57:05,564 --> 00:57:08,067
I want to be a truly capable woman.

921
00:57:08,067 --> 00:57:09,368
Then what about marriage?

922
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:11,003
Marriage?

923
00:57:11,203 --> 00:57:13,072
Why get married?

924
00:57:13,606 --> 00:57:16,675
For a woman,
marriage is a grave and hell.

925
00:57:16,675 --> 00:57:18,277
Doing it knowing that...

926
00:57:18,277 --> 00:57:20,713
means you're a fool
with a single-digit IQ.

927
00:57:21,147 --> 00:57:22,414
- Exactly.
- Yes.

928
00:57:22,414 --> 00:57:24,650
The ones I'll never understand...

929
00:57:25,084 --> 00:57:27,253
are women who let men control them.

930
00:57:27,253 --> 00:57:28,154
Exactly.

931
00:57:28,154 --> 00:57:30,389
Don't they have
any confidence in themselves?

932
00:57:30,723 --> 00:57:33,526
Why be hung up on men?

933
00:57:34,193 --> 00:57:35,161
Right.

934
00:57:35,327 --> 00:57:38,197
Let's not live trapped like that.

935
00:57:38,564 --> 00:57:40,366
Let's live freely.

936
00:57:40,366 --> 00:57:41,367
To the end!

937
00:57:41,367 --> 00:57:42,768
- Deal.
- That's right.

938
00:57:42,768 --> 00:57:43,669
To the end!

939
00:57:43,669 --> 00:57:44,503
Freely!

940
00:57:44,503 --> 00:57:46,038
Freedom!

941
00:57:56,482 --> 00:57:57,383
This is fun.

942
00:58:09,695 --> 00:58:11,931
Can we please go home now?
I have to go home.

943
00:58:11,931 --> 00:58:13,532
No way.

944
00:58:13,532 --> 00:58:16,235
Tonight we party full course
until the end.

945
00:58:16,235 --> 00:58:18,037
Because...

946
00:58:18,037 --> 00:58:20,306
today is Na Jeong's birthday!

947
00:58:22,875 --> 00:58:24,710
This time, full speed.

948
00:58:25,211 --> 00:58:26,879
Rocket ticket launch!

949
00:58:32,151 --> 00:58:33,152
Run.

950
00:58:33,152 --> 00:58:34,153
I'm dizzy.

951
00:58:34,887 --> 00:58:36,822
Hey, I'm dizzy.

952
00:58:40,593 --> 00:58:41,427
Run.

953
00:58:42,328 --> 00:58:43,329
Let's go.

954
00:59:40,386 --> 00:59:42,521
(Don't call me ma'am)

955
00:59:42,521 --> 00:59:44,390
With the final interview ahead,

956
00:59:44,390 --> 00:59:47,126
a perfect final look is essential.

957
00:59:47,126 --> 00:59:50,229
Fashionistas, will you report for duty?

958
00:59:50,229 --> 00:59:52,965
Rumor has it
that he's having an affair with Seon Min.

959
00:59:52,965 --> 00:59:55,868
Don't tell me you're actually
in a special relationship with her.

960
00:59:55,868 --> 00:59:57,169
What's going on between you two?

961
00:59:57,169 --> 00:59:58,571
Hey, if things aren't working out,

962
00:59:58,571 --> 01:00:00,840
don't be embarrassed
and try marriage counseling.

963
01:00:03,175 --> 01:00:06,345
I dressed him, fed him,
and tucked him in for three years.

964
01:00:06,345 --> 01:00:07,246
Then he dumped me.

965
01:00:07,246 --> 01:00:09,281
So a goodbye kiss
should be allowed, right?

966
01:00:09,281 --> 01:00:12,017
But are you really a show host
who's been out for six years?

967
01:00:12,017 --> 01:00:14,787
You look ready to sell everything out
starting tomorrow.

968
01:00:14,787 --> 01:00:17,089
This is your show host who has returned,
Cho Na Jeong.

969
01:00:19,358 --> 01:00:21,360
