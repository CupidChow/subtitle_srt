1
00:00:28,112 --> 00:00:29,113
(This drama is a work of fiction.)
(Names and contents of people, places,)

00:00:29,113 --> 00:00:30,114
(organizations, events, and backgrounds
are not related to real life.)

00:00:30,114 --> 00:00:31,115
(Child actors filmed under guardian
supervision in a safe environment.)

00:00:37,088 --> 00:00:38,189
(Min Woo, Min Jun's Mom)

5
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:42,927
- I can't get through...
- Ugh, come on.

6
00:00:46,664 --> 00:00:49,233
(Episode 3)

7
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:54,705
(Min Woo, Min Jun's Mom)

8
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:06,917
Why won't he pick up?

9
00:01:07,184 --> 00:01:09,253
I have to tell them this news right away.

10
00:01:36,881 --> 00:01:38,616
Incredible.

11
00:01:38,616 --> 00:01:40,651
Cho Na Jeong, you're amazing.

12
00:01:40,651 --> 00:01:43,788
You just rushed there but got accepted.

13
00:01:43,788 --> 00:01:45,656
Yes. Thank you so much.

14
00:01:45,656 --> 00:01:47,692
This is all thanks to you, Jin Hee.

15
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,493
Yeah.

16
00:01:49,493 --> 00:01:51,028
Now that I think about it,

17
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:53,497
borrowing my outfit
must've done the trick.

18
00:01:54,465 --> 00:01:57,468
Hey, you know I have
a pretty good sense of style.

19
00:01:58,235 --> 00:02:00,838
Right, I thought so too.

20
00:02:00,838 --> 00:02:02,873
So are you working right away?

21
00:02:03,374 --> 00:02:05,776
No, that was round two.
There's still a third round.

22
00:02:05,776 --> 00:02:07,078
- Again?
- Yeah.

23
00:02:07,078 --> 00:02:09,413
Why so many rounds?

24
00:02:09,981 --> 00:02:11,449
What's the third one?

25
00:02:11,449 --> 00:02:12,883
That's a camera test.

26
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:14,151
I have to show up looking flawless.

27
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:17,788
I need to pick the product I'll present
and practice too.

28
00:02:17,788 --> 00:02:19,457
There are tons to do.

29
00:02:19,457 --> 00:02:20,725
Really?

30
00:02:20,725 --> 00:02:22,827
Then that's serious.

31
00:02:22,827 --> 00:02:24,795
All the show hosts on TV...

32
00:02:24,795 --> 00:02:27,265
looked so polished.

33
00:02:29,133 --> 00:02:31,602
Jin Hee, I'm just not dressed up yet.

34
00:02:31,602 --> 00:02:33,104
Once I do,

35
00:02:33,104 --> 00:02:34,538
game over.

36
00:02:34,538 --> 00:02:35,606
Did anyone say otherwise?

37
00:02:37,408 --> 00:02:38,743
But, Jin Hee,

38
00:02:39,043 --> 00:02:41,078
what's all this stuff?

39
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:42,680
Are you selling dish scrubbers or what?

40
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,249
The kids' flea market
is the week after next.

41
00:02:45,483 --> 00:02:47,451
Ah Young wants to sell these then,

42
00:02:47,451 --> 00:02:50,054
so I bought a bunch of scrubber yarn,
but I'm handling it all.

43
00:02:50,054 --> 00:02:51,255
Right.

44
00:02:52,623 --> 00:02:53,824
This is bad.

45
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:56,160
I have to prepare for the final interview.
I don't have time.

46
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,996
Hey, no matter how busy you are,
you have to go.

47
00:02:58,996 --> 00:03:01,198
The kids have been
looking forward to it so much.

48
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:13,411
You're late.

49
00:03:15,246 --> 00:03:17,348
Hey, did you hear?

50
00:03:18,649 --> 00:03:21,385
I had a second interview
at Sweet Home Shopping,

51
00:03:21,652 --> 00:03:22,620
and I passed.

52
00:03:23,187 --> 00:03:24,522
Sorry I couldn't tell you sooner.

53
00:03:25,523 --> 00:03:27,158
You know, at the interview, I...

54
00:03:27,158 --> 00:03:28,192
I can't even.

55
00:03:29,427 --> 00:03:30,494
Are you joking?

56
00:03:30,962 --> 00:03:32,530
You just get on with it
and tell me afterwards?

57
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:33,698
Then why act like you care what I say?

58
00:03:34,632 --> 00:03:36,467
Just don't come to me later
saying it's tough...

59
00:03:36,467 --> 00:03:38,436
or asking why I didn't stop you.

60
00:03:38,703 --> 00:03:40,638
Why would you say that?

61
00:03:40,638 --> 00:03:42,506
It's not like I'm abandoning the family.

62
00:03:42,506 --> 00:03:43,874
I'm just trying to do my job.

63
00:03:43,874 --> 00:03:45,476
Mom.

64
00:03:46,344 --> 00:03:48,045
What are you doing?
He's calling for you.

65
00:03:51,949 --> 00:03:54,285
What's with him?

66
00:03:56,387 --> 00:03:58,089
I can't even.

67
00:03:58,089 --> 00:04:00,825
I never realized
he could be so selfish and stubborn.

68
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:03,461
So that's it.

69
00:04:03,461 --> 00:04:05,696
He said that first
so I wouldn't ask him to babysit later.

70
00:04:06,897 --> 00:04:09,367
If you act like that,
do you think I'll quit?

71
00:04:09,767 --> 00:04:11,435
Just wait and see, Noh Won Bin.

72
00:04:17,308 --> 00:04:18,276
One, two.

73
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,261
One more time.

74
00:04:37,828 --> 00:04:40,431
Lady over there,
don't you want to look better?

75
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:43,968
You need to pedal to lose weight.

76
00:04:53,878 --> 00:04:54,879
All right, one main set.

77
00:05:18,102 --> 00:05:19,804
(Na Jeong)

78
00:05:19,804 --> 00:05:20,671
You scared me.

79
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:22,206
This is "before."

80
00:05:25,643 --> 00:05:28,112
With the final interview ahead,

81
00:05:28,112 --> 00:05:30,881
a perfect final look is essential.

82
00:05:30,881 --> 00:05:33,718
Fashionistas, will you report for duty?

83
00:05:47,798 --> 00:05:51,002
Does anyone know a hitman's number?

84
00:05:51,002 --> 00:05:51,902
Why?

85
00:05:51,902 --> 00:05:53,537
Do I look that terrible?

86
00:05:54,272 --> 00:05:56,274
That jerk Eom Jong Do...

87
00:05:56,274 --> 00:05:57,775
had another woman.

88
00:05:57,775 --> 00:05:58,643
What?

89
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:03,748
I saw it for sure.

90
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:05,650
It was a kiss.

91
00:06:06,917 --> 00:06:08,452
He was two-timing me
before we even broke up.

92
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:10,988
Nothing else makes sense.

93
00:06:10,988 --> 00:06:11,756
You're right.

94
00:06:11,756 --> 00:06:14,558
So I went to his place and waited.

95
00:06:15,793 --> 00:06:17,929
And it was almost 4 a.m.
when he showed up.

96
00:06:19,096 --> 00:06:21,132
What kind of trash is that?

97
00:06:21,132 --> 00:06:22,033
So then?

98
00:06:35,012 --> 00:06:36,647
Why are you acting like that?

99
00:06:36,647 --> 00:06:37,682
Hey.

100
00:06:37,682 --> 00:06:38,950
Clench your jaw.

101
00:06:46,891 --> 00:06:48,593
Isn't it obvious?

102
00:06:49,026 --> 00:06:50,695
I beat the crap out of him and came home.

103
00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:53,397
Good job.

104
00:06:53,898 --> 00:06:56,667
You should've called me,
and I'd have helped.

105
00:06:58,069 --> 00:06:59,537
Even grinding him up wouldn't be enough.

106
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:01,238
See? What did we tell you?

107
00:07:01,238 --> 00:07:03,441
We said he was bad news and to dump him.

108
00:07:03,441 --> 00:07:07,044
Yeah, I should've listened
to my friends sooner.

109
00:07:10,448 --> 00:07:12,383
Hey, maybe it's for the best.

110
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:14,485
At least now you've seen for yourself
what trash he is.

111
00:07:14,485 --> 00:07:17,221
Right. Don't hang on.
Just move on clean.

112
00:07:17,221 --> 00:07:19,190
Hey, who's hanging on?

113
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:21,259
I was just playing with him anyway.

114
00:07:21,259 --> 00:07:23,294
This time it's really over. Over!

115
00:07:25,963 --> 00:07:26,764
I've got a truckload of guys...

116
00:07:26,764 --> 00:07:28,833
who'd come running if I call.

117
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:31,102
You guys know
how irresistibly charming I am, right?

118
00:07:31,335 --> 00:07:33,404
What? Jealous, you married ones?

119
00:07:40,044 --> 00:07:41,912
(Dressing Room)

120
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:52,523
Mirror, mirror on the wall,
who's the fairest of them all?

121
00:07:52,523 --> 00:07:53,391
Me?

122
00:07:53,391 --> 00:07:55,159
Gosh, I think you're right.

123
00:07:56,093 --> 00:07:57,061
It says it's me.

124
00:07:58,262 --> 00:08:00,231
Nope, it says it's me.

125
00:08:00,932 --> 00:08:01,999
Then take off those sunglasses.

126
00:08:01,999 --> 00:08:03,334
How could you wear them
when we have nothing?

127
00:08:03,334 --> 00:08:05,002
Guys, don't we look way too single?

128
00:08:05,002 --> 00:08:05,937
You are single.

129
00:08:05,937 --> 00:08:06,771
- Let's go clubbing.
- Should we?

130
00:08:06,771 --> 00:08:07,605
Club.

131
00:08:07,605 --> 00:08:10,308
- Nice.
- How long has it been?

132
00:08:15,179 --> 00:08:16,948
This is so good.

133
00:08:16,948 --> 00:08:18,983
It's been so long
since I've had something this spicy.

134
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:21,185
You know what my wish is these days?

135
00:08:21,886 --> 00:08:24,388
To sleep spread out without the kids,

136
00:08:24,388 --> 00:08:26,624
and to eat food that's not chopped up.

137
00:08:26,624 --> 00:08:29,060
Big, hearty bites like this,

138
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,761
and spicy food.

139
00:08:31,729 --> 00:08:33,164
You sleep with your kids?

140
00:08:33,898 --> 00:08:35,266
Not with Won Bin?

141
00:08:35,499 --> 00:08:36,300
Mostly.

142
00:08:36,767 --> 00:08:39,070
But if I'm not there when they wake up,

143
00:08:39,303 --> 00:08:42,807
they start yelling for me,
morning or dawn.

144
00:08:42,807 --> 00:08:45,476
Then what about your sex life?

145
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,445
If my husband opens the door,

146
00:08:47,445 --> 00:08:49,280
I pretend to be asleep.

147
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,582
If someone installed CCTVs in our house,

148
00:08:51,882 --> 00:08:53,017
it'd be rated "All Ages."

149
00:08:53,017 --> 00:08:55,286
We're an incredibly wholesome family.

150
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,156
I can't even stand to look at him
these days, so I don't even want to.

151
00:08:59,156 --> 00:09:00,524
I'm done. I'm not doing it anymore.

152
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,793
We don't find each other
attractive anymore anyway.

153
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:03,794
I get it.

154
00:09:04,028 --> 00:09:06,464
They say about 40 percent of couples
are sexless these days.

155
00:09:06,464 --> 00:09:08,132
Why? Are you two having issues?

156
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:10,234
No.

157
00:09:10,234 --> 00:09:11,369
It's not that.

158
00:09:11,369 --> 00:09:14,639
Maybe for Na Jeong it's one thing,
but it's not the same for you two.

159
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:15,873
I said it's not like that.

160
00:09:16,073 --> 00:09:17,508
Hey, if things aren't working out,

161
00:09:17,508 --> 00:09:19,977
don't be embarrassed
and try marriage counseling.

162
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:22,313
Bottling it up won't fix anything.

163
00:09:22,313 --> 00:09:23,214
True.

164
00:09:26,117 --> 00:09:27,051
Excuse me.

165
00:09:32,924 --> 00:09:33,991
Fortune cookies?

166
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:36,027
Amazing!

167
00:09:36,761 --> 00:09:39,964
These fortune cookies are known
to be freakishly accurate.

168
00:09:40,464 --> 00:09:42,133
But don't say yours out loud.

169
00:09:42,633 --> 00:09:45,102
You know if you talk about a dream
too soon, it turns bad, right?

170
00:09:45,102 --> 00:09:47,104
Okay.

171
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:50,308
One, two, three.

172
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:57,148
A woman with a flower,
a man with a flower.

173
00:09:57,715 --> 00:09:58,883
Break the mold.

174
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:01,886
A new encounter awaits you.

175
00:10:06,624 --> 00:10:10,061
A typhoon begins
with the flutter of a butterfly's wings.

176
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:12,263
What's this supposed to mean?

177
00:10:12,263 --> 00:10:13,230
A typhoon?

178
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:14,932
What?

179
00:10:14,932 --> 00:10:18,369
Does it mean Jong Do's coming to make up?

180
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,471
A new encounter?

181
00:10:21,772 --> 00:10:22,773
Pregnancy?

182
00:10:23,207 --> 00:10:23,874
What does yours say?

183
00:10:25,076 --> 00:10:26,978
You said we're not supposed
to say it out loud.

184
00:10:26,978 --> 00:10:28,012
That's just superstition.

185
00:10:28,913 --> 00:10:29,947
And you?

186
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:32,717
I don't know. It sounds like nonsense.

187
00:10:33,484 --> 00:10:34,485
You?

188
00:10:34,485 --> 00:10:36,387
I'm not sure. It's kind of vague.

189
00:10:50,201 --> 00:10:51,302
You're here.

190
00:10:51,302 --> 00:10:52,703
- Hey.
- Give me that.

191
00:10:52,703 --> 00:10:54,372
- Have you eaten dinner?
- Yeah.

192
00:11:03,814 --> 00:11:04,615
Why?

193
00:11:05,249 --> 00:11:06,284
Do you have something to say?

194
00:11:08,653 --> 00:11:10,021
Honey, should we maybe...

195
00:11:11,522 --> 00:11:13,591
try marriage counseling or something?

196
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,028
I think...

197
00:11:17,428 --> 00:11:20,031
I've got some kind of wall up inside,

198
00:11:22,066 --> 00:11:23,601
and I feel guilty about it.

199
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:26,938
You don't want to?

200
00:11:27,738 --> 00:11:29,407
No, not at all.

201
00:11:33,544 --> 00:11:36,047
You're being really brave.

202
00:11:38,616 --> 00:11:39,617
Thank you.

203
00:11:56,901 --> 00:11:57,835
All right.

204
00:11:59,737 --> 00:12:03,207
Hello, everyone. Thank you for waiting.

205
00:12:03,207 --> 00:12:05,343
This is your host Cho Na Jeong,
back again...

206
00:12:05,343 --> 00:12:06,277
Mom.

207
00:12:07,578 --> 00:12:09,080
Min Jun, you're awake?

208
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:10,481
Let's go.

209
00:12:10,948 --> 00:12:12,350
You're up.

210
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,442
It's okay.

211
00:12:38,709 --> 00:12:40,645
Let's go back to sleep.

212
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:43,514
Good night.

213
00:12:47,285 --> 00:12:48,786
Good night.

214
00:13:31,629 --> 00:13:35,132
Hello, everyone.
You've been waiting so long, right?

215
00:13:35,132 --> 00:13:38,769
This is your shopping host,
Cho Na Jeong, back again!

216
00:13:39,904 --> 00:13:42,506
Everyone, with this dry weather lately,

217
00:13:42,506 --> 00:13:45,009
your skin must be struggling, right?

218
00:13:45,009 --> 00:13:46,544
That's why now, more than ever,

219
00:13:46,544 --> 00:13:49,113
you need extra skin care.

220
00:13:49,113 --> 00:13:51,082
So, the product I brought today...

221
00:13:51,782 --> 00:13:52,583
is...

222
00:13:53,884 --> 00:13:55,720
Ta-da! This one right here.

223
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,956
Instead of explaining this,

224
00:13:58,956 --> 00:14:02,326
it's better to just show you.

225
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,862
Look, everyone.

226
00:14:04,862 --> 00:14:06,831
I can already feel how moisturizing it is.

227
00:14:07,331 --> 00:14:08,199
Ta-da.

228
00:14:12,436 --> 00:14:15,773
Men can be sensitive.

229
00:14:16,741 --> 00:14:19,110
They can easily get trapped in trauma.

230
00:14:20,411 --> 00:14:21,979
After one failure,

231
00:14:21,979 --> 00:14:24,548
they become afraid
of disappointing their wives again.

232
00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:27,318
So the wife...

233
00:14:27,318 --> 00:14:30,221
should never yell at him
to get it up immediately...

234
00:14:30,221 --> 00:14:32,356
or make fun of him.

235
00:14:37,862 --> 00:14:38,696
Ma'am,

236
00:14:39,196 --> 00:14:42,199
have you ever shown dissatisfaction...

237
00:14:42,199 --> 00:14:44,368
when being intimate with your husband?

238
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:46,637
Well,

239
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:52,043
maybe he might've felt that way.

240
00:14:57,081 --> 00:14:57,848
Okay.

241
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:01,118
Then shall we go...

242
00:15:01,118 --> 00:15:02,253
to break through that trauma?

243
00:15:08,626 --> 00:15:10,494
Sir, stand up.

244
00:15:11,162 --> 00:15:13,531
You have to get out of it on your own.

245
00:15:13,531 --> 00:15:14,398
You can do it.

246
00:15:14,966 --> 00:15:15,866
You can do it.

247
00:15:15,866 --> 00:15:17,234
Now, let's break the mold.

248
00:15:18,069 --> 00:15:19,737
Sir, stand up.

249
00:15:20,771 --> 00:15:22,673
You have to stand up on your own.

250
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,642
You can do it.

251
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:29,447
Now, spring up and straighten your back!

252
00:15:29,747 --> 00:15:30,681
Spring up.

253
00:15:31,182 --> 00:15:32,383
That's it, good.

254
00:15:34,285 --> 00:15:35,186
One more time.

255
00:15:35,186 --> 00:15:37,822
- Try again, tighten up.
- I can do it.

256
00:15:37,822 --> 00:15:39,690
Once more time, on your own.

257
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:41,859
- Rise up.
- Rise up...

258
00:15:41,859 --> 00:15:43,828
- Lift yourself up.
- I can do it.

259
00:15:43,828 --> 00:15:44,929
Rise up.

260
00:15:44,929 --> 00:15:46,797
- You can do it.
- You can stand.

261
00:15:46,797 --> 00:15:47,898
You can stand up.

262
00:15:47,898 --> 00:15:48,933
Honey, I can do it.

263
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,668
- One more time.
- I can do it, honey.

264
00:15:50,668 --> 00:15:52,703
Straighten your back.

265
00:15:52,703 --> 00:15:53,704
Stand tall.

266
00:15:55,106 --> 00:15:57,041
It's okay. Everyone's like that at first.

267
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:58,042
Break, no.

268
00:15:58,042 --> 00:15:59,343
I mean, break free.

269
00:15:59,343 --> 00:16:01,145
I want to overcome this.

270
00:16:03,748 --> 00:16:04,982
- You can do it.
- I can do it.

271
00:16:06,117 --> 00:16:07,952
Like a cocoon turning into a butterfly.

272
00:16:08,419 --> 00:16:10,721
- It's okay.
- You're becoming a butterfly now.

273
00:16:10,721 --> 00:16:12,123
Now, stand up.

274
00:16:12,123 --> 00:16:13,824
You can do it.

275
00:16:17,595 --> 00:16:18,629
No, help me.

276
00:16:18,629 --> 00:16:19,764
Help me.

277
00:16:21,465 --> 00:16:23,134
All right, let's join forces.

278
00:16:23,134 --> 00:16:25,169
- Let's help him stand up.
- Okay.

279
00:16:25,169 --> 00:16:27,371
Now, feel the tremor...

280
00:16:27,872 --> 00:16:30,441
of overcoming for yourself.

281
00:16:30,441 --> 00:16:31,309
I can do it.

282
00:16:31,309 --> 00:16:32,843
- I want to break out of this mold.
- You can do it.

283
00:16:32,843 --> 00:16:34,245
I want to overcome it.

284
00:16:34,245 --> 00:16:35,346
- I can do it.
- You can do it.

285
00:16:35,346 --> 00:16:36,380
I can do it!

286
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,848
Break the mold.

287
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:40,351
Break the mold.

288
00:16:40,351 --> 00:16:41,185
The mold.

289
00:16:46,691 --> 00:16:47,725
Honey.

290
00:17:04,108 --> 00:17:04,976
You can go.

291
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:08,379
Ask for something for the bruise,
and they'll give it to you.

292
00:17:08,379 --> 00:17:09,747
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

293
00:17:09,747 --> 00:17:11,182
No.

294
00:17:11,415 --> 00:17:13,484
You had such a strong will
to overcome it...

295
00:17:13,484 --> 00:17:15,052
that you got yourself out of it.

296
00:17:23,427 --> 00:17:27,598
(Pharmacy)

297
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:47,251
What is it?

298
00:17:48,085 --> 00:17:49,086
I forgot my wallet.

299
00:18:10,775 --> 00:18:13,477
Here's your soup.

300
00:18:13,477 --> 00:18:14,278
Here.

301
00:18:15,012 --> 00:18:16,180
It won't take long.

302
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,015
I'll just do a quick round
through the market.

303
00:18:18,616 --> 00:18:20,785
Mom, sorry, and thanks for helping.

304
00:18:21,452 --> 00:18:23,387
But after all those years as a show host,

305
00:18:23,387 --> 00:18:25,022
- you still have to take another test?
- Yeah.

306
00:18:25,389 --> 00:18:26,824
It's been too long since I quit.

307
00:18:26,824 --> 00:18:28,192
So if I don't take it,
I can't get back in.

308
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,262
Go on.

309
00:18:31,262 --> 00:18:32,463
Mother, I'm here.

310
00:18:33,564 --> 00:18:34,565
Aunt, I didn't know you were here.

311
00:18:34,565 --> 00:18:36,267
- Hello.
- Hi.

312
00:18:36,267 --> 00:18:38,069
You're home from work already?

313
00:18:38,069 --> 00:18:40,137
No, I had to stop by the bank,
so I took half a day off.

314
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:42,440
But what brings you here, Aunt?

315
00:18:43,274 --> 00:18:44,175
Well,

316
00:18:44,475 --> 00:18:47,411
she's doing market research
for a job interview.

317
00:18:48,512 --> 00:18:50,715
You're getting back to work?

318
00:18:50,715 --> 00:18:53,451
I'm just checking things out for now.

319
00:18:54,118 --> 00:18:54,952
I see.

320
00:19:08,699 --> 00:19:09,634
Aunt.

321
00:19:10,001 --> 00:19:11,936
I'll give you a ride.
Where are you headed?

322
00:19:11,936 --> 00:19:14,038
That's all right.
It doesn't take long by subway.

323
00:19:14,038 --> 00:19:15,006
Take care.

324
00:19:15,006 --> 00:19:15,940
- Okay.
- Okay.

325
00:19:21,345 --> 00:19:22,179
Wait.

326
00:19:22,847 --> 00:19:25,283
I know what you're worried about.

327
00:19:25,283 --> 00:19:27,618
But I'm not asking Mom to babysit.

328
00:19:27,618 --> 00:19:30,488
And I already hired a nanny.

329
00:19:30,488 --> 00:19:32,256
That's not what I meant.

330
00:19:33,224 --> 00:19:35,126
What I'm trying to say is this.

331
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,095
You've been out of work for six years,

332
00:19:38,095 --> 00:19:40,064
so don't take it lightly,

333
00:19:40,064 --> 00:19:41,766
and make sure you prepare thoroughly.

334
00:19:42,667 --> 00:19:45,369
You know how fast
the world moves these days.

335
00:19:47,171 --> 00:19:48,005
But...

336
00:19:48,606 --> 00:19:50,775
why do you want to go back to work?

337
00:19:51,309 --> 00:19:52,410
For the money?

338
00:19:53,978 --> 00:19:56,280
Of course, that's part of it, but...

339
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,883
But this only looks nice on the outside.

340
00:19:58,883 --> 00:20:01,052
Having two incomes doesn't
necessarily mean making more money.

341
00:20:01,819 --> 00:20:03,888
I support Mother financially.

342
00:20:04,355 --> 00:20:06,223
I even bought her a new fridge recently.

343
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:10,127
Sometimes I wonder
if this is really worth it...

344
00:20:11,028 --> 00:20:12,430
or if I'm actually taking a loss.

345
00:20:18,603 --> 00:20:19,470
Wait, please.

346
00:20:55,106 --> 00:20:56,007
Noh Won Bin.

347
00:20:59,243 --> 00:21:00,678
What on earth is going on?

348
00:21:01,712 --> 00:21:04,282
Rumor has it that you're
having an affair with Seon Min.

349
00:21:04,615 --> 00:21:05,383
What?

350
00:21:07,451 --> 00:21:08,219
So...

351
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,188
please, get a grip...

352
00:21:11,522 --> 00:21:12,723
and cut things off with her.

353
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:15,960
Na Jeong might even get hired soon.

354
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,162
Do you really want your wife
to see you like this?

355
00:21:36,847 --> 00:21:38,049
Hey, are the kids asleep?

356
00:21:38,516 --> 00:21:39,417
Yeah.

357
00:21:45,156 --> 00:21:45,990
Here.

358
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:48,359
What's this?

359
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:52,196
I asked around,
and some partner companies are looking...

360
00:21:52,196 --> 00:21:54,465
for people with
major TV network experience.

361
00:21:55,232 --> 00:21:57,768
It's not exactly hosting a show
like you want,

362
00:21:57,768 --> 00:21:59,303
but the work's pretty similar.

363
00:21:59,503 --> 00:22:01,339
The pay's not bad either, so check it out.

364
00:22:01,772 --> 00:22:02,573
So what you're saying...

365
00:22:03,207 --> 00:22:06,611
is that I shouldn't have
the Sweet Home Shopping interview, right?

366
00:22:06,611 --> 00:22:09,447
They're doing that program
just to please the government.

367
00:22:09,447 --> 00:22:11,749
Even if you get in, they'll just
treat you like a disposable item.

368
00:22:11,749 --> 00:22:13,250
So why even bother going there?

369
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:14,385
I told you.

370
00:22:14,385 --> 00:22:16,354
I want to go there
because it's Sweet Home Shopping.

371
00:22:16,887 --> 00:22:18,689
Even if they abandon me later,

372
00:22:18,689 --> 00:22:21,826
I want to clear my name.

373
00:22:21,826 --> 00:22:23,728
I get how you feel, honey,

374
00:22:23,728 --> 00:22:26,230
but that's meaningless in a company.

375
00:22:27,131 --> 00:22:29,100
If you look elsewhere,
you'll find something better and...

376
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:29,934
No, I don't want to.

377
00:22:30,401 --> 00:22:32,403
No matter what you say,
I'm having the final interview.

378
00:22:32,403 --> 00:22:34,405
Why won't you listen to me?

379
00:22:34,405 --> 00:22:35,773
There's nothing good
waiting for you there.

380
00:22:35,773 --> 00:22:37,742
Why are you so against it?

381
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:39,977
Is there some reason
I shouldn't go back there?

382
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:42,546
What?

383
00:22:43,748 --> 00:22:45,850
Of course, not.

384
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:49,020
I just think
you'll wear yourself out for nothing.

385
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:49,887
Wait.

386
00:22:50,454 --> 00:22:51,589
Is it because you're ashamed of me?

387
00:22:51,789 --> 00:22:52,690
What?

388
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:55,026
Because your wife
who's been out of work for six years,

389
00:22:55,026 --> 00:22:57,395
is now a middle-aged woman
who's about to work with you,

390
00:22:57,395 --> 00:22:58,796
are you ashamed?

391
00:22:58,963 --> 00:23:00,965
What are you even talking about?

392
00:23:00,965 --> 00:23:02,600
Then what is it?

393
00:23:03,034 --> 00:23:05,202
Why are you so against it?

394
00:23:06,103 --> 00:23:08,306
Just say it.

395
00:23:10,207 --> 00:23:11,475
All right, fine.

396
00:23:12,944 --> 00:23:14,912
Yeah, I'm ashamed, okay?

397
00:23:19,817 --> 00:23:21,018
I can't even.

398
00:24:10,434 --> 00:24:13,037
(Enter unlock pattern.)

399
00:24:25,182 --> 00:24:26,784
This is driving me insane.

400
00:24:40,965 --> 00:24:41,866
What's this?

401
00:25:02,086 --> 00:25:03,120
Get up. Now.

402
00:25:03,588 --> 00:25:04,522
What?

403
00:25:04,522 --> 00:25:05,756
I said get up!

404
00:25:07,224 --> 00:25:08,092
Why?

405
00:25:09,427 --> 00:25:10,494
What's this?

406
00:25:11,095 --> 00:25:12,296
Who's this for?

407
00:25:17,802 --> 00:25:18,703
Mom.

408
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:19,804
What?

409
00:25:20,905 --> 00:25:23,341
When I went on that business trip,

410
00:25:23,341 --> 00:25:25,209
she asked me to secretly buy her...

411
00:25:25,843 --> 00:25:27,445
some underwear at duty-free.

412
00:25:27,645 --> 00:25:29,080
Do you expect me to believe that?

413
00:25:29,513 --> 00:25:31,716
Why would your mom wear a thong?

414
00:25:31,716 --> 00:25:32,350
Honey.

415
00:25:33,017 --> 00:25:35,419
You shouldn't assume
older women don't wear thongs.

416
00:25:35,419 --> 00:25:38,256
My mom also has the right
to fulfill her sexual fantasy.

417
00:25:40,458 --> 00:25:41,425
I was having such a good sleep.

418
00:25:50,401 --> 00:25:52,903
Did you see Manager Shin's pants today?

419
00:25:52,903 --> 00:25:53,804
I did.

420
00:25:54,405 --> 00:25:55,439
Red.

421
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,608
Unbelievable.

422
00:25:57,608 --> 00:25:59,710
Who wears pants like that at his age?

423
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:00,745
Seriously.

424
00:26:00,745 --> 00:26:04,215
But there's something I've been wondering.

425
00:26:04,215 --> 00:26:05,016
What is it, Manager Gu?

426
00:26:05,716 --> 00:26:07,151
Have any of you...

427
00:26:07,718 --> 00:26:09,820
ever worn a thong?

428
00:26:10,254 --> 00:26:11,422
A thong?

429
00:26:12,023 --> 00:26:13,925
No. Are you going to wear one?

430
00:26:13,925 --> 00:26:17,094
No, not me.

431
00:26:18,095 --> 00:26:19,563
I just heard...

432
00:26:19,563 --> 00:26:22,099
some older people wear them too,

433
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:26,304
so I was just curious why.

434
00:26:27,171 --> 00:26:29,340
I've also heard...

435
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:32,576
some people say once they try one,
it's so comfortable...

436
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:34,145
that they can't go back...

437
00:26:34,145 --> 00:26:36,180
to regular underwear.

438
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,849
Really?

439
00:26:38,849 --> 00:26:39,984
And...

440
00:26:43,254 --> 00:26:44,455
What are you doing over there?

441
00:26:47,058 --> 00:26:49,860
Nothing.

442
00:26:52,029 --> 00:26:53,564
Please, go on.

443
00:26:53,831 --> 00:26:54,832
Please.

444
00:26:59,003 --> 00:26:59,971
Did he hear everything?

445
00:26:59,971 --> 00:27:00,905
What's with him?

446
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,308
Yeah, Mom.

447
00:27:05,376 --> 00:27:06,711
Do you wear thongs too?

448
00:27:07,878 --> 00:27:08,713
Yeah.

449
00:27:09,347 --> 00:27:10,481
I heard they're comfortable.

450
00:27:10,881 --> 00:27:11,983
What's wrong with him?

451
00:27:19,824 --> 00:27:20,925
What's that?

452
00:27:21,659 --> 00:27:23,594
Why is someone else's car
parked in my spot?

453
00:27:31,802 --> 00:27:33,871
That's so rude.

454
00:27:34,639 --> 00:27:37,842
(Reserved Parking
Car No. 132C 5067)

455
00:27:37,842 --> 00:27:38,809
Hello?

456
00:27:39,377 --> 00:27:41,379
Excuse me, could you move your car?

457
00:27:41,379 --> 00:27:42,747
You're in my parking space.

458
00:27:42,747 --> 00:27:44,649
Really?

459
00:27:44,649 --> 00:27:47,118
Can't you just park
somewhere else for now?

460
00:27:47,118 --> 00:27:48,352
I can't go at the moment.

461
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:49,253
Excuse me.

462
00:27:49,787 --> 00:27:52,657
Why would I park somewhere else
when my spot's right here?

463
00:27:52,924 --> 00:27:55,059
Come and move your car now.

464
00:27:55,293 --> 00:27:56,794
How annoying.

465
00:27:57,028 --> 00:27:57,995
What a hassle.

466
00:28:00,731 --> 00:28:01,499
What?

467
00:28:02,733 --> 00:28:04,368
Why is she talking
like her tongue's missing?

468
00:28:31,596 --> 00:28:32,363
Let's go.

469
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:34,131
Let's go.

470
00:28:35,466 --> 00:28:36,267
Show me cute.

471
00:28:36,667 --> 00:28:38,636
Cute, yes.

472
00:28:38,903 --> 00:28:39,904
Sexy.

473
00:28:40,972 --> 00:28:41,939
Beautiful.

474
00:28:45,743 --> 00:28:47,345
Deputy Editor.

475
00:28:50,948 --> 00:28:54,018
So it was you.

476
00:28:54,018 --> 00:28:57,455
Why were you in such a rush and so angry?

477
00:28:57,788 --> 00:29:00,258
You scared me half to death earlier.

478
00:29:00,958 --> 00:29:03,127
Sorry, this is my assigned parking space.

479
00:29:07,298 --> 00:29:09,066
Honey, wait in the car.

480
00:29:09,267 --> 00:29:10,134
Okay.

481
00:29:15,873 --> 00:29:18,809
Actually, I wanted to talk
to the magazine team anyway.

482
00:29:20,544 --> 00:29:21,646
Mind if I?

483
00:29:21,646 --> 00:29:22,380
About what?

484
00:29:23,047 --> 00:29:26,083
I stopped by the salon the other day,

485
00:29:26,384 --> 00:29:28,920
and happened to see our magazine.

486
00:29:30,621 --> 00:29:32,957
I was honestly shocked...

487
00:29:33,424 --> 00:29:34,525
because there was nothing
worth looking at.

488
00:29:34,792 --> 00:29:36,661
But as you know,
the licensing market these days...

489
00:29:36,661 --> 00:29:39,497
is shifting toward digital platforms,

490
00:29:39,497 --> 00:29:41,999
and since the digital team got stronger,
our followers have grown...

491
00:29:41,999 --> 00:29:42,833
So...

492
00:29:42,833 --> 00:29:44,502
it's okay for the magazine
to have nothing worth seeing?

493
00:29:44,502 --> 00:29:45,736
Should we just shut it down, then?

494
00:29:46,337 --> 00:29:47,538
I'll call my dad.

495
00:29:48,406 --> 00:29:49,173
Should I?

496
00:29:49,674 --> 00:29:50,474
Should I?

497
00:29:54,045 --> 00:29:55,246
Excuse me, Deputy Editor.

498
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,682
You know why...

499
00:29:57,682 --> 00:30:00,318
my dad keeps paying
those crazy license fees...

500
00:30:00,952 --> 00:30:04,388
and lets me run
this unprofitable magazine?

501
00:30:05,489 --> 00:30:08,559
Probably so he can say we're leading...

502
00:30:08,926 --> 00:30:10,361
the print-based culture, right?

503
00:30:11,028 --> 00:30:12,930
But if it doesn't even do that anymore,

504
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:14,165
then what's the point?

505
00:30:14,498 --> 00:30:15,433
It's embarrassing.

506
00:30:17,168 --> 00:30:18,135
We might as well close it down.

507
00:30:20,538 --> 00:30:21,706
So please,

508
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:23,808
do better.

509
00:30:24,308 --> 00:30:25,910
Got it?

510
00:30:26,711 --> 00:30:29,046
In that sense, make a heart.

511
00:30:30,348 --> 00:30:31,182
No?

512
00:30:34,652 --> 00:30:35,586
Fine, then.

513
00:30:36,387 --> 00:30:37,788
Anyway, take care.

514
00:31:25,503 --> 00:31:26,604
Ta-da.

515
00:31:26,604 --> 00:31:27,738
Merry Christmas.

516
00:31:31,142 --> 00:31:34,145
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

517
00:31:34,145 --> 00:31:35,012
I brought something too.

518
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,480
For me?

519
00:31:37,581 --> 00:31:38,749
- Should we open them together?
- Yes.

520
00:31:38,749 --> 00:31:40,017
One, two, three.

521
00:31:41,852 --> 00:31:43,654
Il Ri, this is exactly what I wanted.

522
00:31:44,255 --> 00:31:45,356
This must've been expensive.

523
00:31:46,424 --> 00:31:47,525
What's this?

524
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,361
This is me,

525
00:31:51,028 --> 00:31:52,597
and this is you, Il Ri.

526
00:31:53,664 --> 00:31:54,465
Cute, right?

527
00:31:58,536 --> 00:31:59,604
(Price 5 dollars)

528
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:02,206
How do I look? Does it suit me?

529
00:32:03,841 --> 00:32:04,709
Yeah, it's cute.

530
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:06,871
What the...

531
00:33:09,941 --> 00:33:11,042
What do you think you're doing?

532
00:33:31,862 --> 00:33:34,131
Hey! What was that?

533
00:33:35,833 --> 00:33:36,867
Damn it.

534
00:33:38,102 --> 00:33:39,971
I didn't kiss her. You saw that, right?

535
00:33:40,805 --> 00:33:41,839
She's the one who kissed me.

536
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,541
Ma'am.

537
00:33:44,141 --> 00:33:45,910
You know,

538
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:48,245
I dressed him, fed him,
and tucked him in for three years.

539
00:33:48,245 --> 00:33:49,246
Then he dumped me.

540
00:33:50,214 --> 00:33:52,416
So a goodbye kiss should be allowed.

541
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:53,884
Right?

542
00:34:14,705 --> 00:34:16,507
She's crazy.

543
00:34:17,441 --> 00:34:19,644
She's totally nuts.

544
00:34:21,445 --> 00:34:23,314
(Green Forest Kindergarten
Thrifty Flea Market)

545
00:34:25,316 --> 00:34:27,485
Welcome.
Would you like some coffee?

546
00:34:27,485 --> 00:34:29,854
It's summer,
so have some watermelon juice.

547
00:34:29,854 --> 00:34:30,955
Have a great day.

548
00:34:30,955 --> 00:34:32,924
Thank you. Bye.

549
00:34:32,924 --> 00:34:34,125
Bye.

550
00:34:34,125 --> 00:34:34,992
Goodness.

551
00:34:38,796 --> 00:34:40,698
You look tired today.

552
00:34:40,698 --> 00:34:41,632
What's wrong?

553
00:34:41,999 --> 00:34:43,668
I had a fight with my husband yesterday.

554
00:34:44,302 --> 00:34:45,102
Why?

555
00:34:46,103 --> 00:34:48,739
He keeps trying to stop me
from having the final interview at Sweet.

556
00:34:48,739 --> 00:34:50,341
So I asked him why,

557
00:34:51,242 --> 00:34:52,343
and he said he's embarrassed...

558
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:53,945
to work at the same company as me.

559
00:34:54,211 --> 00:34:56,514
It's not like I wanted to quit my career
and look like this.

560
00:34:56,514 --> 00:34:58,683
I stepped away for the family,
and he said he was ashamed.

561
00:35:01,385 --> 00:35:03,120
Hearing that from him...

562
00:35:03,921 --> 00:35:05,356
just crushed my confidence even more.

563
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:07,925
The more I prepare,

564
00:35:08,225 --> 00:35:10,795
the less I know what I practice with.

565
00:35:11,462 --> 00:35:13,631
I feel so out of touch
with the trends too.

566
00:35:13,631 --> 00:35:16,567
But you did so well in the second round.

567
00:35:17,134 --> 00:35:20,204
Hey, interviews are all about attitude.

568
00:35:20,705 --> 00:35:22,239
That was just luck.

569
00:35:24,108 --> 00:35:26,677
The world's changed so much in six years,

570
00:35:27,278 --> 00:35:28,546
but I've just been standing still.

571
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:40,524
How much is this?

572
00:35:40,524 --> 00:35:41,459
That's 50 cents.

573
00:35:44,495 --> 00:35:45,963
I've never seen a black one before.

574
00:35:46,564 --> 00:35:47,465
This one's 50 cents.

575
00:35:48,466 --> 00:35:49,367
How much is this?

576
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,835
- Fifty cents.
- One hundred thousand.

577
00:35:52,336 --> 00:35:53,170
No, it's not.

578
00:35:56,073 --> 00:35:58,876
One, two, three, four.

579
00:35:58,876 --> 00:36:01,912
Okay, that'll be 147 dollars total.

580
00:36:03,714 --> 00:36:06,417
Maybe it's because of the heat,
but it ended faster than I expected.

581
00:36:06,417 --> 00:36:07,218
I know, right?

582
00:36:07,218 --> 00:36:08,786
Then should we start packing up...

583
00:36:08,786 --> 00:36:10,388
and go see how the kids are doing?

584
00:36:10,388 --> 00:36:11,188
Sure.

585
00:36:14,959 --> 00:36:16,360
Mom.

586
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,194
Ah Young.

587
00:36:17,695 --> 00:36:19,297
What is it, Ah Young?

588
00:36:19,297 --> 00:36:22,767
- Why are you crying?
- Mom, nobody's buying my scrubbers.

589
00:36:23,701 --> 00:36:25,937
It's okay.

590
00:36:25,937 --> 00:36:28,940
Ah Young, how about
we try selling them together now?

591
00:36:29,774 --> 00:36:31,375
There, there.

592
00:36:31,375 --> 00:36:32,176
Good girl.

593
00:36:33,144 --> 00:36:34,478
Dish scrubbers for sale.

594
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:36,981
My daughter crocheted these herself.

595
00:36:36,981 --> 00:36:38,616
They sell for three dollars elsewhere,

596
00:36:38,616 --> 00:36:40,051
but I'll give them to you for just two.

597
00:36:40,351 --> 00:36:43,087
Take a look at these dish scrubbers.
They're cheap.

598
00:36:43,087 --> 00:36:44,522
Dish scrubbers for sale.

599
00:36:44,522 --> 00:36:47,458
They're hand-crocheted scrubbers.

600
00:36:47,458 --> 00:36:48,492
Come take a look.

601
00:36:50,595 --> 00:36:52,430
What should we do?

602
00:36:57,868 --> 00:36:58,669
Jin Hee.

603
00:36:59,236 --> 00:37:00,338
I've got an idea.

604
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:24,895
(Don't eat it.
Save it for your dishes.)

605
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:27,064
(Ah Young's Rainbow Dish Scrubbers)

606
00:37:27,064 --> 00:37:28,599
Hello!

607
00:37:28,599 --> 00:37:31,535
Dear little customers and homemakers,

608
00:37:31,535 --> 00:37:33,170
today I've brought you something...

609
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:36,207
you absolutely don't want to miss.

610
00:37:36,207 --> 00:37:38,242
Dish scrubbers.

611
00:37:38,242 --> 00:37:39,410
But everyone,

612
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:42,480
the regular scrubbers you use at home...

613
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,316
absorb too much water,

614
00:37:45,316 --> 00:37:47,285
making them a breeding ground
for bacteria,

615
00:37:47,285 --> 00:37:50,087
and they don't dry well either.

616
00:37:50,087 --> 00:37:51,656
But how about this one?

617
00:37:55,993 --> 00:37:57,695
No matter how much you squeeze,
it's the same.

618
00:37:57,695 --> 00:37:59,630
You waste tons of detergent.

619
00:37:59,931 --> 00:38:00,932
But...

620
00:38:00,932 --> 00:38:04,035
this product is different.

621
00:38:04,035 --> 00:38:07,571
It's hand-crocheted,
so it drains water super well.

622
00:38:07,571 --> 00:38:10,441
Now, let's try scrubbing off
these tough stains.

623
00:38:13,244 --> 00:38:14,011
Watch this.

624
00:38:17,048 --> 00:38:18,983
See that?

625
00:38:18,983 --> 00:38:21,852
Just one quick rinse and it's spotless.

626
00:38:22,353 --> 00:38:25,623
These pretty,
100 percent hand-crocheted scrubbers...

627
00:38:25,623 --> 00:38:28,960
are only two dollars each.

628
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,628
But today only,

629
00:38:31,629 --> 00:38:34,165
we have a special bundle deal.

630
00:38:34,165 --> 00:38:36,400
A scrubber bun,

631
00:38:37,034 --> 00:38:37,969
patty,

632
00:38:38,903 --> 00:38:39,870
cheese,

633
00:38:40,471 --> 00:38:41,439
lettuce,

634
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:43,774
and tomato-.

635
00:38:43,774 --> 00:38:44,742
Ta-da.

636
00:38:44,742 --> 00:38:46,911
A full hamburger set.

637
00:38:46,911 --> 00:38:49,914
Six scrubbers for just 6.9 dollars.

638
00:38:50,314 --> 00:38:52,416
Cute to look at, and great to use.

639
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:55,853
Isn't this practically a steal?

640
00:38:55,853 --> 00:38:58,656
An amazing chance
to get this 12-dollar original set...

641
00:38:58,656 --> 00:39:01,259
at an incredible price.

642
00:39:02,994 --> 00:39:03,928
Here you go.

643
00:39:04,362 --> 00:39:06,397
Thank you.

644
00:39:06,397 --> 00:39:07,164
Yes.

645
00:39:07,164 --> 00:39:08,366
Thank you.

646
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,167
Thank you.

647
00:39:12,069 --> 00:39:13,004
Sorry.

648
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:16,707
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

649
00:39:16,707 --> 00:39:18,242
Would you like two?

650
00:39:20,144 --> 00:39:22,213
Here you go, thank you.

651
00:39:22,213 --> 00:39:23,180
Yes, take care.

652
00:39:27,318 --> 00:39:29,287
- Here you go, thank you.
- Yes.

653
00:39:30,021 --> 00:39:32,657
Mom, can I go to the playground
with Ah Young?

654
00:39:32,657 --> 00:39:33,691
Sure, go ahead.

655
00:39:33,691 --> 00:39:35,393
- Let's go, Ah Young.
- Okay, have fun.

656
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:39,363
Thanks, Na Jeong.

657
00:39:39,363 --> 00:39:40,631
You did great, Jin Hee.

658
00:39:40,631 --> 00:39:43,467
Thanks to you, Ah Young is smiling again.

659
00:39:44,068 --> 00:39:47,071
But are you really a show host
who's been out for six years?

660
00:39:47,071 --> 00:39:49,540
You look ready to sell everything out
starting tomorrow.

661
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:50,942
You're flattering me.

662
00:39:50,942 --> 00:39:54,111
And because you're speaking
from experience,

663
00:39:54,111 --> 00:39:55,913
it really hits home.

664
00:39:55,913 --> 00:39:57,014
I see.

665
00:40:22,139 --> 00:40:23,074
Honey, I'm home.

666
00:40:23,074 --> 00:40:25,176
- Hey.
- Hey.

667
00:40:25,176 --> 00:40:27,244
- Min Woo, Dad's home.
- Dad's home.

668
00:40:28,946 --> 00:40:30,181
What are you doing?

669
00:40:30,414 --> 00:40:33,851
Alkaline soaps are bad
for Min Woo's eczema, right?

670
00:40:33,851 --> 00:40:36,954
But the mild ones in stores
are so expensive,

671
00:40:36,954 --> 00:40:38,356
so I thought I'd try making some myself.

672
00:40:41,392 --> 00:40:43,194
Honey, look here.

673
00:40:44,528 --> 00:40:47,198
Don't film me.
I haven't even washed up yet.

674
00:40:47,198 --> 00:40:48,866
You still look beautiful anyway.

675
00:40:48,866 --> 00:40:49,700
Come on, look here.

676
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:50,768
Stop.

677
00:40:51,002 --> 00:40:51,902
Wait.

678
00:40:53,471 --> 00:40:55,139
One, two, three.

679
00:41:35,947 --> 00:41:37,682
Eom Jong Do.

680
00:41:38,616 --> 00:41:40,217
You bastard.

681
00:42:05,343 --> 00:42:07,011
What's wrong with you?

682
00:42:07,011 --> 00:42:08,012
Where have you been?

683
00:42:08,646 --> 00:42:09,747
Why do you care?

684
00:42:11,482 --> 00:42:13,117
You were with her, weren't you?

685
00:42:14,685 --> 00:42:16,387
What are you talking about?

686
00:42:16,387 --> 00:42:17,555
I saw everything.

687
00:42:18,723 --> 00:42:20,091
You kissing that woman.

688
00:42:23,561 --> 00:42:25,196
Who I kiss or who I marry.

689
00:42:25,196 --> 00:42:26,564
What's that got to do with you?

690
00:42:27,064 --> 00:42:28,432
You're the one
who dumped me out of nowhere.

691
00:42:28,432 --> 00:42:30,134
And now you're suddenly acting
like my wife?

692
00:42:30,134 --> 00:42:31,769
Don't you think that's a bit ridiculous?

693
00:42:31,769 --> 00:42:33,271
You pushed me into it.

694
00:42:33,738 --> 00:42:35,640
You made me say "Let's break up."

695
00:42:36,607 --> 00:42:38,676
How long has it even been
since we split up?

696
00:42:39,076 --> 00:42:40,378
And you're already seeing someone else?

697
00:42:41,712 --> 00:42:43,147
Were you with her...

698
00:42:43,514 --> 00:42:45,216
while you were still seeing me?

699
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:47,551
Does that even matter now?

700
00:42:47,985 --> 00:42:49,053
Of course, it does.

701
00:42:50,621 --> 00:42:52,657
It matters, you bastard.

702
00:42:52,657 --> 00:42:54,725
Why are you being so pathetic?

703
00:42:55,993 --> 00:42:56,861
What?

704
00:42:57,895 --> 00:42:58,963
Pathetic?

705
00:43:00,331 --> 00:43:03,100
Yeah. I've wanted to break up
with you for a long time.

706
00:43:03,401 --> 00:43:04,302
You know why?

707
00:43:04,302 --> 00:43:05,903
Because I know you wanted to marry me.

708
00:43:05,903 --> 00:43:07,838
But didn't we agree not to put
that kind of pressure on each other?

709
00:43:08,406 --> 00:43:10,541
Why do you always say one thing
and act another way?

710
00:43:12,343 --> 00:43:13,411
You know I'm not the kind of guy...

711
00:43:13,411 --> 00:43:15,379
who can give you that kind of life.

712
00:43:15,379 --> 00:43:16,514
So find someone...

713
00:43:16,514 --> 00:43:18,549
who can do that for you.

714
00:43:31,329 --> 00:43:34,031
(Photographer Eom)

715
00:43:34,031 --> 00:43:35,333
(Delete)

716
00:43:36,033 --> 00:43:36,834
All right.

717
00:43:37,635 --> 00:43:38,502
Three,

718
00:43:38,803 --> 00:43:39,704
two,

719
00:43:42,506 --> 00:43:43,374
one.

720
00:44:02,326 --> 00:44:03,961
(SOLO
Back to Single)

721
00:44:05,496 --> 00:44:08,366
Man number four, your time to choose.

722
00:44:08,366 --> 00:44:09,333
Go.

723
00:44:10,568 --> 00:44:14,972
(Who will Man no. 4 choose?)

724
00:44:14,972 --> 00:44:17,908
Now, ladies, please turn around.

725
00:44:20,645 --> 00:44:24,982
(Woman no. 1 gets to dine with two men.)

726
00:44:25,182 --> 00:44:29,120
(Then, what about Woman no. 2?)

727
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:30,254
(Correct guess, Man no. 3)

728
00:44:33,324 --> 00:44:35,192
(Man no. 4 chooses Woman no. 4.)

729
00:44:35,192 --> 00:44:37,161
(And...)

730
00:44:37,461 --> 00:44:40,364
(Everyone enjoys a warm
and cozy lunch date.)

731
00:44:40,364 --> 00:44:41,933
I really love figures.

732
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:43,701
This looks so good.

It's not like I went there
to act desperate.

744

745

on Man no. 4.

746

the cheating jerk isn't the problem,

That's because...

839
00:50:28,045 --> 00:50:30,815
this is a handmade soap
I personally created...

840
00:50:30,815 --> 00:50:32,450

But actually, my first son...

844
00:50:41,792 --> 00:50:45,296
suffered from severe eczema
when he was little.

845
00:50:46,163 --> 00:50:47,965
What? Eczema?

your kid's illness as an excuse,

847
00:50:49,867 --> 00:50:51,302
you might as well quit.

848
00:50:52,470 --> 00:50:54,939
I tried every folk remedy there was,

849
00:50:54,939 --> 00:50:57,008
and every moisturizer under the sun.

850
00:50:57,441 --> 00:51:01,345
But the one thing
that made the biggest difference...

851
00:51:01,345 --> 00:51:03,814
was switching soaps.

852
00:51:04,548 --> 00:51:07,652
What's the most important part
of treating atopic skin?

853
00:51:07,652 --> 00:51:09,453
Moisture.

00:51:10,187 --> 00:51:13,291
You all know
we have slightly acidic skin, right?

855
00:51:13,291 --> 00:51:16,093
But most soaps we use...

856
00:51:16,093 --> 00:51:17,995
are alkaline.

857
00:51:18,362 --> 00:51:20,798
And that's terrible for the skin.

The natural oils on your face
that shine...

859
00:51:25,069 --> 00:51:29,407
is actually a protective layer.

860
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:32,777
But alkaline soaps strip it all away.

861
00:51:33,277 --> 00:51:36,614
You should never use soaps like that.

862
00:51:37,014 --> 00:51:39,250
No matter how good your moisturizer is,

863
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:42,753
if you wash with an alkaline soap,

864
00:51:42,753 --> 00:51:44,989
it's all wasted effort.

873
00:52:07,645 --> 00:52:09,947

on the makeup...

for a show host,

876
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:19,290

should change depending on the product.

877
00:52:19,657 --> 00:52:22,026

you might lack some competitiveness?

Well,

884
00:52:37,308 --> 00:52:40,278
I don't think
having more life experience...

885
00:52:40,278 --> 00:52:42,280
is a disadvantage for a show host.

886
00:52:43,247 --> 00:52:45,283

it allows for genuine storytelling...

We have to hang out today,
don't you think?

914
00:57:15,052 --> 00:57:16,053
Obviously.

915
00:57:16,053 --> 00:57:18,289
No matter what happens,
let's leave work on time today, girls.

916
00:57:18,589 --> 00:57:19,523
How about here?

917
00:57:19,890 --> 00:57:22,226
Nice.

918
00:57:22,226 --> 00:57:24,295
Deal. 7 p.m. here, then.

919
00:57:24,295 --> 00:57:27,331
Na Jeong, hope today's the happiest day
in the world for you.

920
00:57:28,699 --> 00:57:29,433
Hey!

921
00:57:38,743 --> 00:57:40,511
Can we change the meeting place?

922
00:57:40,511 --> 00:57:42,346
It looks like I'll be working late again.

923
00:57:43,648 --> 00:57:44,649
No.

924
00:57:46,517 --> 00:57:48,152
What are you still doing here,
not buying it?

925
00:57:48,152 --> 00:57:50,121
It feels like another tough day
for me too.

926
00:57:50,121 --> 00:57:52,323
Let's push it back to 8 p.m.

927
00:57:52,723 --> 00:57:54,525
Assistant Gu,
can you pick some up from Euljiro?

928
00:57:54,525 --> 00:57:56,060
Yes, I'll stop by.

929
00:57:58,963 --> 00:58:00,164
I'm in trouble too.

930
00:58:00,164 --> 00:58:01,933
Let's make it an hour later. 9 p.m.

931
00:58:02,566 --> 00:58:03,668
Damn it.

932
00:58:04,168 --> 00:58:07,004
I really wanted to go
somewhere hip tonight.

933
00:58:08,439 --> 00:58:11,108
How long do we have to
keep living like this?

934
00:58:12,276 --> 00:58:13,811
It won't be forever.

935
00:58:14,879 --> 00:58:18,716
Once we hit 40, things will slow down.

936
00:58:21,419 --> 00:58:22,420
Yeah.

937
00:58:23,187 --> 00:58:24,922
They say it hurts
because it's youth, right?

938
00:58:26,757 --> 00:58:27,658
Yeah, what a load of crap.

939
00:58:31,562 --> 00:58:32,396
Hey.

940
00:58:33,998 --> 00:58:36,200
Ten years from now,

941
00:58:36,934 --> 00:58:39,103
we'll be dining somewhere fancy, right?

942
00:58:39,670 --> 00:58:42,873
Each of us with a Chanel bag,

943
00:58:43,641 --> 00:58:46,344
stepping out of our BMWs.

944
00:58:47,144 --> 00:58:49,046
We'll be glowing, right?

945
00:58:49,547 --> 00:58:50,314
Right?

946
00:58:50,815 --> 00:58:51,682
Of course.

947
00:58:51,682 --> 00:58:53,951
Then let's promise.
No more cheap meals like this.

948
00:58:53,951 --> 00:58:54,752
Promise.

949
00:58:54,752 --> 00:58:58,189
To our elegant, dazzling future.

950
00:58:58,623 --> 00:58:59,857
Cheers.

951
01:00:02,253 --> 01:00:04,355
(Don't call me ma'am)

952
01:00:04,355 --> 01:00:05,957
What? You got in too?

953
01:00:06,390 --> 01:00:08,426
I really can't stand her.

954
01:00:08,426 --> 01:00:10,161
I'll work hard,

955
01:00:10,161 --> 01:00:11,696
so please help me out.

956
01:00:11,696 --> 01:00:12,997
What? I can't even.

957
01:00:12,997 --> 01:00:15,666
If she gets special treatment
just because she used to work here,

958
01:00:16,133 --> 01:00:18,135
I'm not letting that slide.

959
01:00:19,704 --> 01:00:21,005
Hey, go for it with him.

960
01:00:21,005 --> 01:00:23,307
Yes, and the timing is perfect too.

961
01:00:23,541 --> 01:00:24,442
How'd it go?

962
01:00:24,442 --> 01:00:25,509
Tell me.

963
01:00:25,509 --> 01:00:26,777
I think I'm pregnant.

964
01:00:26,777 --> 01:00:27,645
Yes, Mother?

965
01:00:27,645 --> 01:00:29,380
No issues with your marital life, right?

966
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:30,881
Here, take this.

967
01:00:30,881 --> 01:00:32,717
I got it from a monk I know.

968
01:00:32,717 --> 01:00:33,985
No! Somebody help.

969
01:00:34,251 --> 01:00:36,053
You're the only one
who can go on air right now.

970
01:00:36,053 --> 01:00:37,154
You'll have to do it.

971
01:00:37,154 --> 01:00:37,955
Can you handle it?

972
01:00:37,955 --> 01:00:39,190
Good. Then get there right away.

973
01:00:39,523 --> 01:00:40,625
Broadcast in ten seconds.

974
01:00:44,996 --> 01:00:46,998
