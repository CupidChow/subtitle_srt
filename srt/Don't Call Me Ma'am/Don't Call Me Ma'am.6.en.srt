Hey.

7
00:00:55,368 --> 00:00:56,736
What are you doing here?

8
00:00:57,837 --> 00:00:59,472
What are you doing here, honey?

9
00:01:02,575 --> 00:01:04,443
Hello, Ms. Cho.

10
00:01:04,443 --> 00:01:07,346
I'm Kim Seon Min,
a show host who used to work...

11
00:01:07,346 --> 00:01:08,948
with Producer Noh at Sweet Home Shopping.

12
00:01:14,754 --> 00:01:18,224
I see. I think we've met before.

13
00:01:19,458 --> 00:01:20,860
But with my husband...

14
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,863
- Actually...
- I couldn't get my contract renewed.

15
00:01:25,531 --> 00:01:28,334
So I came to ask Producer Noh
if he could help me find a job.

16
00:01:29,435 --> 00:01:31,504
But I got so upset
that I just burst into tears.

17
00:01:33,306 --> 00:01:35,007
I see.

18
00:01:35,308 --> 00:01:37,310
Then I'll get going first.

19
00:01:38,044 --> 00:01:39,578
Producer Noh, thank you for today.

20
00:01:39,578 --> 00:01:41,514
Okay. Let's talk again later.

21
00:01:42,682 --> 00:01:43,649
Bye.

22
00:01:49,989 --> 00:01:51,123
What do you think you're doing?

23
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:53,459
Did she really come to ask for a job?

24
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:54,794
Of course, she did.

25
00:01:55,161 --> 00:01:57,029
What kind of weird ideas are you getting?

26
00:01:59,532 --> 00:02:00,399
Seriously?

27
00:02:02,768 --> 00:02:05,037
Someone from the company is coming.
Let's talk at home.

28
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:12,345
Why are you just standing there?

29
00:02:12,645 --> 00:02:13,479
Sit.

30
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,318
Why are you dragging me around like this?

31
00:02:20,152 --> 00:02:21,954
Hey, did you hear...

32
00:02:21,954 --> 00:02:23,256
that you stole my spot at the broadcast?

33
00:02:24,657 --> 00:02:25,858
Damn it.

34
00:02:25,858 --> 00:02:27,960
Go back to Producer Kim right now,

35
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,395
and tell him you'll give it up to me.

36
00:02:29,395 --> 00:02:30,363
What?

37
00:02:30,363 --> 00:02:32,865
You've already been on air once.

38
00:02:32,865 --> 00:02:35,167
Isn't that enough?
How greedy can you get?

39
00:02:36,068 --> 00:02:37,003
I'm not doing that.

40
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:38,437
What?

41
00:02:39,071 --> 00:02:39,972
Why not?

42
00:02:40,506 --> 00:02:42,341
Doing a broadcast is important to me too.

43
00:02:42,341 --> 00:02:44,510
I worked so hard for this opportunity.
Who are you to tell me to give it up?

44
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,815
Jjon Na Jeong.

45
00:02:49,815 --> 00:02:50,716
You've gotten bold.

46
00:02:51,117 --> 00:02:54,754
Did you forget
where you're living right now?

47
00:02:56,188 --> 00:02:58,357
Should I remind you?

48
00:02:59,492 --> 00:03:01,160
Unbelievable.

49
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,528
This thug of a girl...

50
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:05,064
is trying to solve everything
with threats.

51
00:03:05,064 --> 00:03:07,033
You think I'm scared of you?

52
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,367
Just wait and see.

53
00:03:08,367 --> 00:03:10,536
I'll settle this with pure skill.

54
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,872
She doesn't even research products,

55
00:03:12,872 --> 00:03:15,241
and just runs her mouth.

56
00:03:21,013 --> 00:03:23,015
Honey, you're home.

57
00:03:24,684 --> 00:03:26,919
That show host from earlier.

58
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:29,889
She was bawling in front of you.

59
00:03:29,889 --> 00:03:32,058
Well, like Seon Min said earlier,

60
00:03:32,058 --> 00:03:34,460
she didn't get her contract renewed.

61
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,828
So she's trying to find new work,

62
00:03:35,828 --> 00:03:38,030
but things aren't going well,
so she's stressed.

63
00:03:38,931 --> 00:03:40,866
You went through it too,
so you know how that feels.

64
00:03:40,866 --> 00:03:42,168
The economy's bad,

65
00:03:42,168 --> 00:03:44,837
and hardly anyone's hiring show hosts,
so it's tough.

66
00:03:44,837 --> 00:03:45,972
I know.

67
00:03:45,972 --> 00:03:49,442
Even so, why was she crying
right in front of you, honey?

68
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,712
Is it because you couldn't say no again...

69
00:03:52,712 --> 00:03:54,714
when people asked for favors?

70
00:03:55,314 --> 00:03:56,682
Well, something like that.

71
00:03:57,183 --> 00:03:59,885
Or do you and that woman
have something going on?

72
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:01,754
Seriously?

73
00:04:02,121 --> 00:04:03,322
Trust your husband, will you?

74
00:04:04,657 --> 00:04:05,625
Move.

75
00:04:07,526 --> 00:04:08,527
What a temper.

76
00:04:09,895 --> 00:04:13,232
As if someone timid like him
would ever have the guts anyway.

77
00:04:17,103 --> 00:04:19,639
Anyway, how should I handle
Yang Mi Sook...

78
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:21,774
and her little schemes?

79
00:04:21,774 --> 00:04:24,677
She's giving me a serious headache.

80
00:04:25,344 --> 00:04:26,512
Why is this moving so fast?

81
00:04:31,651 --> 00:04:34,954
Against someone who only runs her mouth,
a head-on approach works best.

82
00:04:35,721 --> 00:04:37,156
I'll show her what I can do.

83
00:04:38,691 --> 00:04:39,692
Okay.

84
00:04:43,129 --> 00:04:45,998

Feel free to use this.

00:05:05,551 --> 00:05:06,352
- Thank you.
- Producer Kim.

91
00:05:08,854 --> 00:05:09,922
Thank you.

92
00:05:10,756 --> 00:05:12,191
Ms. Yang, is this real?

93
00:05:12,892 --> 00:05:13,960
No.

94
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,028
It's a dupe we sell on our website.

95
00:05:16,028 --> 00:05:17,530
I brought it so you could all use it
without feeling burdened.

96
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:19,899
Even if it's a dupe,
you shouldn't give us things like this.

97
00:05:19,899 --> 00:05:21,033
Come on, it's just a dupe.

98
00:05:21,033 --> 00:05:22,468
Just use it comfortably.

99
00:05:22,468 --> 00:05:24,203
Thank you, I will.

Really? Thank you.

103
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:30,476
No, I should be thanking you.

104
00:05:30,476 --> 00:05:31,744
- I'll see you later.
- Yes, see you.

105
00:05:31,744 --> 00:05:32,712
- Yes.
- Thank you.

106
00:05:32,712 --> 00:05:33,713

What do you think you're doing?

110
00:05:43,823 --> 00:05:45,891
Why are you bribing the staff?

111
00:05:46,292 --> 00:05:48,461
Weren't you the one
who wanted a fair and square match?

112
00:05:48,461 --> 00:05:50,096
Do you call this fair and square?

113
00:05:50,096 --> 00:05:51,697
You're being ridiculous.

114
00:05:51,864 --> 00:05:53,366
You were already an employee here.

115
00:05:53,366 --> 00:05:54,934
So this cannot be fair and square anyway.

116
00:05:55,534 --> 00:05:57,937
All I've got is money.
What are you going to do about it?

117

119

She majored in art.

120
00:06:11,117 --> 00:06:13,586
She's a student,

121
00:06:13,586 --> 00:06:15,121
but her grades...

122
00:06:16,155 --> 00:06:16,923
Really?

123
00:06:17,957 --> 00:06:20,927
I didn't know you needed
good college entrance exam scores.

124
00:06:21,928 --> 00:06:23,396
She should've prepared properly, but...

126
00:06:28,567 --> 00:06:29,402
Yes?

127
00:06:29,869 --> 00:06:32,538
When did I drop that?

128
00:06:32,538 --> 00:06:33,839
I didn't even notice.

129
00:06:34,307 --> 00:06:35,241
Wait a minute.

131
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:42,582
You didn't have to do all this.

132
00:06:42,582 --> 00:06:44,016
I know you'll do just fine.

Why do you need to know that?

00:09:43,629 --> 00:09:46,132
It's just that I saw her on the rooftop...

185
00:09:46,132 --> 00:09:49,001
with some guy, and the vibe was flirty.

186
00:09:49,001 --> 00:09:52,571
Did that guy look kind of like a giraffe?

187
00:09:53,005 --> 00:09:54,073
You knew?

188
00:09:55,441 --> 00:09:57,977
That man is Ms. Cho's husband.

189
00:09:57,977 --> 00:09:59,178
He's a producer here.

190
00:09:59,378 --> 00:10:00,246
Really?

191
00:10:09,755 --> 00:10:10,823
Are you done for the day?

192
00:10:12,124 --> 00:10:12,925
Yes.

193
00:10:13,893 --> 00:10:15,661
Writing monitoring reports...

194
00:10:15,661 --> 00:10:17,997
and sitting in on broadcasts
are exhausting.

195
00:10:17,997 --> 00:10:19,865
I'd rather do the broadcast.

196
00:10:19,865 --> 00:10:21,300
How long are they going to
keep us watching?

197
00:10:22,301 --> 00:10:23,469
I know, right?

198
00:10:23,469 --> 00:10:25,838
Someone is already
on the broadcast schedule,

199
00:10:25,838 --> 00:10:27,406
while others are stuck as extras.

200
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,841
Exactly.

201
00:10:29,408 --> 00:10:32,445
But did you two know...

202
00:10:32,445 --> 00:10:35,448
that Cho Na Jeong's husband
is a producer here?

203
00:10:36,015 --> 00:10:37,116
Really?

204
00:10:37,116 --> 00:10:39,819
She was goofing around
with some guy on the rooftop,

205
00:10:39,819 --> 00:10:42,188
and it turned out that was her husband.

206
00:10:42,188 --> 00:10:43,956
- I see.
- I see.

207
00:10:47,994 --> 00:10:51,397
Do you not get what I'm trying to say?

208
00:10:51,897 --> 00:10:54,467
Isn't it strange
that only she keeps getting opportunities?

209
00:10:54,867 --> 00:10:56,802
She used to work here,
and her husband is a producer here.

210
00:10:57,436 --> 00:10:59,839
Of course, she'd get special treatment.

211
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:00,773
Is that so?

212
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,341
You're right.

213
00:11:03,476 --> 00:11:05,011
Now that I think about it,

214
00:11:05,011 --> 00:11:06,412
during the entrance test,

215
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:10,182
it felt like she was absolutely ready
and answered so smoothly.

216
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:12,885
I thought she was just good,

217
00:11:13,619 --> 00:11:16,522
but maybe she already knew the questions.

218
00:11:16,522 --> 00:11:17,823
Goodness, really?

219
00:11:17,823 --> 00:11:18,691
Really?

220
00:11:19,158 --> 00:11:20,259
Yes.

221
00:11:20,993 --> 00:11:22,328
Now that I think about it,

222
00:11:22,328 --> 00:11:24,363
there were several weird things.

223
00:11:24,363 --> 00:11:26,032
Even when we had lunch before,

224
00:11:26,032 --> 00:11:29,035
the other show hosts said
they'd heard she'd come back,

225
00:11:29,035 --> 00:11:30,469
didn't they?

226
00:11:30,903 --> 00:11:32,271
Then what are we doing here?

227
00:11:32,271 --> 00:11:34,106
Are we just extras
who'll fade out in the end?

228
00:11:36,509 --> 00:11:37,743
That can't happen.

229
00:11:38,411 --> 00:11:40,346
I came here determined to make this work.

230
00:11:41,847 --> 00:11:42,949
Honestly,

231
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:45,451
we probably shouldn't let this slide.

232
00:11:46,452 --> 00:11:48,821
I'll make a separate group chat.

233
00:11:49,255 --> 00:11:50,990
Let's talk there.

234
00:11:51,924 --> 00:11:53,159
- That sounds good.
- Yes.

235
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,868
I knew something felt off.

236
00:12:02,868 --> 00:12:04,870
The team leader plays favorites
with Ms. Cho,

237
00:12:05,137 --> 00:12:06,939
and she's the only one
invited to company dinners.

238
00:12:06,939 --> 00:12:09,809
And she's always had
that superiority vibe.

239
00:12:09,809 --> 00:12:13,045
Like she's different
from people who did live commerce.

240
00:12:13,045 --> 00:12:14,780
Do you think during the entrance test,

241
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,415
they gave her the questions in advance?

242
00:12:16,749 --> 00:12:18,718
Mi Sook says it seems like it.

243
00:12:18,718 --> 00:12:21,621
But if we only have suspicions
and no proof,

244
00:12:21,621 --> 00:12:23,289
wouldn't we be accusing
an innocent person?

245
00:12:24,323 --> 00:12:25,458
I have proof.

246
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:27,360
Really? What proof?

247
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,263
I used to work as a show host,

248
00:12:30,263 --> 00:12:32,131
but after having kids,

249
00:12:32,131 --> 00:12:34,000
I quit about six years ago.

250
00:12:34,467 --> 00:12:37,837
Even when I wanted to work again,
I never got a chance.

251
00:12:37,837 --> 00:12:40,606
Then I heard Sweet Home Shopping
was holding an information session,

252
00:12:40,606 --> 00:12:41,974
so I applied.

253
00:12:41,974 --> 00:12:43,776
Isn't this proof?

254
00:12:43,776 --> 00:12:47,246
This shows she was already
in contact with the company.

255
00:12:47,246 --> 00:12:47,980
No way.

256
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:48,948
Unbelievable.

257
00:12:48,948 --> 00:12:49,949
Insane.

258
00:12:49,949 --> 00:12:51,984
So it was all rigged from the start?

259
00:12:52,685 --> 00:12:55,421
At this rate, she was pre-selected
from the beginning.

260
00:12:55,421 --> 00:12:56,555
Yeah.

261
00:12:56,822 --> 00:12:57,890
Exactly.

262
00:12:57,890 --> 00:12:59,058
I can't even.

263
00:12:59,058 --> 00:13:00,192
Everyone.

264
00:13:00,192 --> 00:13:02,561
We all agree
we can't just let this slide, right?

265
00:13:03,362 --> 00:13:05,097
Tomorrow, without Cho Na Jeong,

266
00:13:05,097 --> 00:13:07,166
let's meet and talk among ourselves.

267
00:13:11,671 --> 00:13:12,605
- Mom.
- Yeah?

268
00:13:12,605 --> 00:13:14,974
A new girl joined our kindergarten,

269
00:13:14,974 --> 00:13:16,642
and she's really pretty.

270
00:13:16,642 --> 00:13:17,677
What?

271
00:13:17,677 --> 00:13:20,980
Does my son now have a girlfriend
he likes more than Mom?

272
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:21,981
What's her name?

273
00:13:21,981 --> 00:13:22,815
Joo Ri Ae.

274
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:26,619
Her dad lives in China,
and her mom lives in Korea.

275
00:13:26,619 --> 00:13:28,321
Then is her dad Chinese?

276
00:13:28,321 --> 00:13:31,023
No, but Ri Ae says
she doesn't want to go to China.

277
00:13:31,023 --> 00:13:32,325
She says her stepmom is scary.

278
00:13:32,325 --> 00:13:33,359
I see.

279
00:13:33,826 --> 00:13:34,860
Joo Ri Ae.

280
00:13:35,227 --> 00:13:36,362
Noh Min Woo.

281
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:41,500
Mom, this is my girlfriend.

282
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,336
Mom, this is my boyfriend.

283
00:13:46,072 --> 00:13:47,006
What?

284
00:13:47,273 --> 00:13:49,308
You're Joo Ri Ae's mom?

285
00:13:50,109 --> 00:13:51,777
How in the world...

286
00:13:51,777 --> 00:13:54,013
does fate work like this?

287
00:13:54,013 --> 00:13:55,748
That's what I want to say.

288
00:13:55,748 --> 00:13:58,184
They say you always run into your enemy
under the persimmon tree.

289
00:13:58,184 --> 00:13:59,185
Persimmon tree?

290
00:14:00,686 --> 00:14:03,122
Your jokes really are lame.

291
00:14:04,724 --> 00:14:08,294
Anyway, Min Woo seems
to be getting close to Ri Ae.

292
00:14:08,294 --> 00:14:10,596
So whenever you have time,
send her over to my place.

293
00:14:11,564 --> 00:14:12,598
Are you crazy?

294
00:14:15,668 --> 00:14:16,402
Let's go.

295
00:14:17,436 --> 00:14:19,705
Mom, I want to play with Noh Min Woo.

296
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:21,274
Quiet.

297
00:14:21,274 --> 00:14:22,875
You're not playing with him ever again.

298
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:23,976
Okay? Come here.

299
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,916
Joo Ri Ae.

300
00:14:31,517 --> 00:14:32,785
Noh Min Woo.

301
00:14:41,427 --> 00:14:42,261
Mom.

302
00:14:42,962 --> 00:14:44,964
Mom, does this mean
I can't play with Joo Ri Ae anymore?

303
00:14:45,331 --> 00:14:46,232
Why not?

304
00:14:46,232 --> 00:14:48,234
- Well...
- Why not?

305
00:14:48,968 --> 00:14:49,869
I mean...

306
00:14:53,506 --> 00:14:55,875
Let's just go. Come on.

307
00:14:59,078 --> 00:15:00,479
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thanks.

308
00:15:06,285 --> 00:15:07,653
Hello.

309
00:15:07,653 --> 00:15:08,821
Can I sit here?

310
00:15:11,891 --> 00:15:14,427
Writing reports is exhausting, right?

311
00:15:14,894 --> 00:15:18,030
Once we start broadcasting,
it'll get even crazier.

312
00:15:19,231 --> 00:15:20,399
Come to think of it,

313
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,302
I don't think we've ever
grabbed a drink together.

314
00:15:23,302 --> 00:15:25,271
Should we plan an intern get-together?

315
00:15:25,938 --> 00:15:26,772
Yes?

316
00:15:27,106 --> 00:15:28,507
You do that get-together alone.

317
00:15:30,309 --> 00:15:33,012
We don't even know
if we'll become full hires.

318
00:15:33,646 --> 00:15:36,182
Let's just grab coffee
since we're done with our meal.

319
00:15:46,859 --> 00:15:48,094
This is hard.

320
00:15:55,234 --> 00:15:56,902
Na Jeong doesn't know yet, right?

321
00:15:56,902 --> 00:15:58,938
About Producer Noh and Seon Min
being like that.

322
00:15:58,938 --> 00:16:00,706
She doesn't.

323
00:16:00,706 --> 00:16:02,041
She'd lose it if she knew.

324
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:03,175
The doors are closing.

325
00:16:03,876 --> 00:16:05,411
Wait.

326
00:16:06,379 --> 00:16:08,381
Are you guys heading home?

327
00:16:08,381 --> 00:16:09,215
Yes.

328
00:16:13,686 --> 00:16:14,820
Are you going to the get-together?

329
00:16:16,155 --> 00:16:18,491
Mi Sook asked me yesterday...

330
00:16:18,491 --> 00:16:20,259
where a good place
for a get-together would be.

331
00:16:20,259 --> 00:16:21,794
So I told her about Million Hof.

332
00:16:22,061 --> 00:16:23,296
You're going there now, aren't you?

333
00:16:24,397 --> 00:16:26,732
Yeah, I am.

334
00:17:08,341 --> 00:17:09,308
Hello.

335
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:11,711
Can I join you for a drink too?

336
00:17:13,145 --> 00:17:16,148
I heard from show host Hong Seon Young...

337
00:17:16,148 --> 00:17:18,184
that everyone was here.

338
00:17:19,485 --> 00:17:21,354
Why didn't you tell me?

339
00:17:21,354 --> 00:17:23,589
I was about to get offended, you know.

340
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:25,691
You didn't leave me out on purpose, right?

341
00:17:26,325 --> 00:17:27,226
I'm sorry,

342
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,228
but we left you out on purpose.

343
00:17:29,996 --> 00:17:31,063
Why?

344
00:17:31,063 --> 00:17:33,799
Your husband's a producer
at Sweet Home Shopping, right?

345
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:35,401
Yeah, so what?

346
00:17:35,768 --> 00:17:37,136
Then...

347
00:17:37,136 --> 00:17:39,639
how can you say that's unrelated
to you becoming the main host...

348
00:17:39,639 --> 00:17:41,407
and co-host all the time?

349
00:17:41,641 --> 00:17:43,576
What are you implying?

350
00:17:46,479 --> 00:17:48,614
So you're saying
I got special treatment...

351
00:17:48,915 --> 00:17:50,950
because of my husband?

352
00:17:53,052 --> 00:17:55,988
Is that why you've all been so cold to me?

353
00:17:58,591 --> 00:17:59,325
No.

354
00:17:59,325 --> 00:18:02,528
I swear to the heavens
I've never gotten special treatment.

355
00:18:02,528 --> 00:18:06,299
And my husband doesn't even have
that kind of power.

356
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:10,102
He actually tried to stop me
from joining here.

357
00:18:10,102 --> 00:18:12,772
But we're all just sitting
on the sidelines...

358
00:18:12,772 --> 00:18:15,174
while you're the only one
who got to do a main broadcast.

359
00:18:15,174 --> 00:18:18,878
That only happened
because the main host had an accident.

360
00:18:18,878 --> 00:18:21,080
Then why were you invited...

361
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,615
to a partner dinner
that we couldn't even attend?

362
00:18:23,149 --> 00:18:24,317
Also,

363
00:18:24,317 --> 00:18:26,419
why did the other show hosts say,

364
00:18:26,419 --> 00:18:28,187
"Your hiring is basically guaranteed?"

365
00:18:29,355 --> 00:18:31,524
That's just a courtesy.

366
00:18:31,857 --> 00:18:35,394
And company dinners are not
special treatment, but just work.

367
00:18:35,394 --> 00:18:38,030
How can you even call that
special treatment?

368
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,265
How is that "work?"

369
00:18:39,265 --> 00:18:40,666
For interns, it's a valuable opportunity.

370
00:18:40,967 --> 00:18:42,468
Seriously?

371
00:18:42,468 --> 00:18:43,903
Then explain this.

372
00:18:43,903 --> 00:18:47,239
Even when I wanted to work again,
I never got a chance.

373
00:18:47,239 --> 00:18:50,009
Then I heard Sweet Home Shopping
was holding an information session,

374
00:18:50,009 --> 00:18:51,444
so I applied.

375
00:18:51,444 --> 00:18:53,479
Do you expect us to believe
this was a coincidence too?

376
00:18:54,513 --> 00:18:55,948
That one really was a coincidence.

377
00:18:56,349 --> 00:18:58,684
It was my birthday,
and I was out meeting friends.

378
00:18:58,684 --> 00:19:00,253
Then they said the interviewee canceled.

379
00:19:00,253 --> 00:19:02,321
So I filled in at the last minute.

380
00:19:03,522 --> 00:19:06,559
And what does that interview
have to do with this?

381
00:19:06,726 --> 00:19:08,060
How does it not?

382
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,229
When we first met,

383
00:19:10,229 --> 00:19:12,765
you said you were already
set to work at Sweet Home Shopping.

384
00:19:15,234 --> 00:19:17,970
So I took a job offer.

385
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:18,838
Really?

386
00:19:20,706 --> 00:19:21,741
From where?

387
00:19:21,741 --> 00:19:22,942
Sweet Home Shopping.

388
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,514
Explain that.

389
00:19:28,848 --> 00:19:30,816
Are you going to say that was a lie too?

390
00:19:35,855 --> 00:19:37,757
I'm sorry about that.

391
00:19:39,659 --> 00:19:41,027
Honestly, back then,

392
00:19:41,627 --> 00:19:44,430
I was embarrassed
to tell you the truth, so I lied.

393
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:46,832
Yeah, right.

394
00:19:47,233 --> 00:19:49,702
They'd already selected you
but told you to pretend...

395
00:19:49,702 --> 00:19:51,671
to take the exam, right?

396
00:19:51,671 --> 00:19:52,838
No.

397
00:19:52,838 --> 00:19:54,774
Have some shame, Cho Na Jeong.

398
00:19:54,774 --> 00:19:57,043
How is it that every time
you open your mouth, it's a lie?

399
00:19:57,043 --> 00:19:59,612
Do you think we dumped our kids
on someone else...

400
00:19:59,612 --> 00:20:01,914
just to be your backdrop?

401
00:20:13,292 --> 00:20:14,927
(Seon Art Center)

402
00:20:22,668 --> 00:20:25,204
I have something to ask.

403
00:20:25,204 --> 00:20:25,871
Yes?

404
00:20:26,672 --> 00:20:28,975
Is there a rumor at the company
that I'm getting divorced?

405
00:20:30,209 --> 00:20:31,711
Who told you that?

406
00:20:33,346 --> 00:20:34,747
The CEO asked...

407
00:20:35,581 --> 00:20:37,583
if I was spaced out because of my divorce.

408
00:20:38,484 --> 00:20:40,553
If the CEO is even saying that,

409
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,856
doesn't that mean
everyone is already gossiping about it?

410
00:20:45,057 --> 00:20:46,092
Who is it?

411
00:20:46,926 --> 00:20:48,961
Who started that baseless rumor?

412
00:20:49,195 --> 00:20:52,131
Actually, Team Leader Shin said...

413
00:20:52,632 --> 00:20:54,133
he saw you coming out of a motel...

414
00:20:54,133 --> 00:20:56,235
across from the company
during lunch break,

415
00:20:56,936 --> 00:20:59,872
and that you were buying sexy underwear,

416
00:20:59,872 --> 00:21:02,875
and that every time you talk
to your husband over the phone, you fight.

417
00:21:03,609 --> 00:21:05,745
So he said you must be having an affair.

418
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:12,818
(Deluxe Hanmaeum Motel)

419
00:21:20,226 --> 00:21:21,427
Has he lost his mind?

420
00:21:22,295 --> 00:21:24,430
How could Team Leader Shin
spread a rumor like that...

421
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:25,998
without even checking with me?

422
00:21:29,268 --> 00:21:30,136
Team Leader Gu.

423
00:21:32,004 --> 00:21:33,339
Where are you going?

424
00:21:33,639 --> 00:21:34,907
Team Leader Gu!

425
00:21:35,174 --> 00:21:36,108
Yeah.

426
00:21:37,777 --> 00:21:39,612
Mom, I'll call you back later.

427
00:21:48,788 --> 00:21:49,956
What do you think you're doing?

428
00:21:50,256 --> 00:21:52,058
Let's step outside and talk.

429
00:21:52,258 --> 00:21:53,259
Say it here.

430
00:21:54,126 --> 00:21:55,027
Why?

431
00:21:55,494 --> 00:21:58,798
Is it too sensitive
to say in front of people?

432
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:01,200
What are you talking about?

433
00:22:01,834 --> 00:22:03,869
I heard you've been telling people...

434
00:22:03,869 --> 00:22:05,338
that I'm having an affair
and getting divorced.

435
00:22:06,872 --> 00:22:11,043
I said it seemed like
you might get divorced.

436
00:22:11,444 --> 00:22:14,280
So you did go around saying
I was having an affair?

437
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,515
Who exactly am I having an affair with?

438
00:22:17,183 --> 00:22:19,085
Did you see it?
Did you see me cheat?

439
00:22:22,221 --> 00:22:24,890
When a married woman goes to a motel...

440
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:26,726
instead of going home,
doesn't that say everything?

441
00:22:26,726 --> 00:22:28,594
What more confirmation do I need?

442
00:22:30,129 --> 00:22:32,632
If you're going to cheat,
at least do it discreetly.

443
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:36,402
And plenty of people have seen you...

444
00:22:36,402 --> 00:22:38,204
snapping at your husband on the phone.

445
00:22:38,938 --> 00:22:40,339
Are they all imagining things?

446
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,643
And I'm the one misunderstanding?

447
00:22:46,879 --> 00:22:48,347
So now I'm curious.

448
00:22:50,883 --> 00:22:53,552
Who's the new guy you're seeing?

449
00:22:54,253 --> 00:22:56,822
That guy from the audition?

450
00:23:01,427 --> 00:23:02,561
Be careful.

451
00:23:03,462 --> 00:23:05,264
You might get reported.

452
00:23:05,264 --> 00:23:06,732
No.

453
00:23:06,732 --> 00:23:08,301
- How many times do I have to tell you?
- Stop.

454
00:23:08,601 --> 00:23:09,702
You bastard.

455
00:23:09,702 --> 00:23:11,871
I'll sue you for defamation.

456
00:23:12,939 --> 00:23:14,774
Someone stop her.

457
00:23:14,774 --> 00:23:15,908
I won't let this go.

458
00:23:16,409 --> 00:23:17,476
You piece of trash.

459
00:23:18,344 --> 00:23:20,346
You've really crossed the line.

460
00:23:21,213 --> 00:23:22,348
Why is she freaking out?

461
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:27,453
Look at this.

462
00:23:29,388 --> 00:23:31,624
- It's really red.
- You two are grown-ups.

463
00:23:31,624 --> 00:23:35,127
You two are supposed to be adults.
What on earth is this?

464
00:23:35,127 --> 00:23:38,130
Why did you go to a motel
in broad daylight, Team Leader Gu?

465
00:23:41,934 --> 00:23:44,770
I'm preparing for pregnancy,

466
00:23:45,571 --> 00:23:47,807
and that day happened to be
my ovulation day.

467
00:23:48,441 --> 00:23:49,442
Ovulation day?

468
00:23:53,913 --> 00:23:56,449
How many times have I told you?

469
00:23:56,449 --> 00:23:57,950
You need to watch what you say.

470
00:23:58,551 --> 00:23:59,986
Aren't you embarrassed
in front of the employees?

471
00:24:03,055 --> 00:24:03,923
I just...

472
00:24:04,824 --> 00:24:06,192
Why didn't you go home?

473
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,707
Yes, Tae Jeong.

474
00:24:27,313 --> 00:24:28,147
What?

475
00:24:34,654 --> 00:24:35,521
So...

476
00:24:36,756 --> 00:24:40,760
the interns think there was corruption
in the hiring process.

477
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,727
Is this what you're saying?

478
00:24:42,128 --> 00:24:43,362
Yes.

479
00:24:43,362 --> 00:24:46,565
Some of the interns
asked me about it yesterday.

480
00:24:48,167 --> 00:24:50,636
How could they even imagine...

481
00:24:50,636 --> 00:24:51,771
we'd have such a sloppy system?

482
00:24:52,772 --> 00:24:53,873
We opened our doors...

483
00:24:54,307 --> 00:24:56,642
to help career-break women
return to society,

484
00:24:56,642 --> 00:24:58,344
and this is how they repay us?

485
00:24:59,512 --> 00:25:01,681
Do they think this place
is some local grocery store?

486
00:25:04,817 --> 00:25:06,886
If I offended you, I'm truly sorry.

487
00:25:07,353 --> 00:25:08,554
But...

488
00:25:08,554 --> 00:25:11,490
Intern Cho Na Jeong definitely told me...

489
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:13,426
that she was already set to work here.

490
00:25:13,426 --> 00:25:15,361
Why did you say something like that
before even taking the exam?

491
00:25:16,395 --> 00:25:17,496
I'm sorry.

492
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:19,966
Without thinking,

493
00:25:19,966 --> 00:25:21,601
I just lied out of embarrassment.

494
00:25:21,601 --> 00:25:24,537
I never imagined it would cause
such a huge misunderstanding.

495
00:25:25,237 --> 00:25:26,172
I'm sorry.

496
00:25:28,708 --> 00:25:29,575
Producer Kim.

497
00:25:30,109 --> 00:25:30,943
Yes?

498
00:25:31,344 --> 00:25:33,980
For now, take Cho Na Jeong
off the schedule completely.

499
00:25:36,315 --> 00:25:39,685
If I went with how I feel,
I'd fire you on the spot.

500
00:25:40,152 --> 00:25:41,520
But you kept the show from falling apart,

501
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,456
so I'll let it slide just this once.

502
00:25:43,656 --> 00:25:44,824
And Ms. Yang,

503
00:25:45,858 --> 00:25:48,327
it seems you don't trust
this company very much.

504
00:25:48,327 --> 00:25:49,428
In that case, the company has no reason...

505
00:25:49,428 --> 00:25:51,530
to treat you like some special rookie.

506
00:25:52,164 --> 00:25:54,300
You'll be on air starting next week.

507
00:25:55,067 --> 00:25:57,403
But if you don't do a good job,

508
00:25:57,837 --> 00:25:59,272
you'll pay the price.

509
00:26:00,773 --> 00:26:01,540
Producer Kim.

510
00:26:02,208 --> 00:26:04,043
Put all the other interns on air too.

511
00:26:04,043 --> 00:26:06,445
And if anyone doesn't have what it takes,
cut them right away.

512
00:26:06,445 --> 00:26:08,080
People who poison the company...

513
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,549
are better off removed quickly
for everyone's sake.

514
00:26:12,852 --> 00:26:14,220
Executive Director.

515
00:26:40,346 --> 00:26:42,481
Mr. Lee Jeong Ho?

516
00:26:45,351 --> 00:26:46,719
He's better than I expected.

517
00:26:49,455 --> 00:26:51,424
Would you like something to drink?

518
00:26:51,424 --> 00:26:52,892
I already ordered mine.

519
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:55,227
You can order over there.

520
00:26:57,663 --> 00:26:58,898
Okay.

521
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:17,817
Mr. Lee, what do you usually do
in your free time?

522
00:27:20,353 --> 00:27:21,254
I'm not sure.

523
00:27:21,621 --> 00:27:24,490
Well, if you're an office worker,
weekends are for catching up on sleep.

524
00:27:25,157 --> 00:27:27,560
But with the kind of job I have,

525
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:31,063
I work hard not to fall behind trends.

526
00:27:31,063 --> 00:27:34,500
I try to go to exhibitions
or performances and such.

527
00:27:36,269 --> 00:27:37,136
Why?

528
00:27:40,206 --> 00:27:41,907
In your photo,

529
00:27:42,575 --> 00:27:44,477
you looked really young.

530
00:27:44,477 --> 00:27:46,512
But seeing you in person,

531
00:27:46,512 --> 00:27:48,114
you look your age.

532
00:27:49,415 --> 00:27:50,583
What is that supposed to mean?

533
00:27:52,151 --> 00:27:53,519
Just saying.

534
00:27:56,689 --> 00:27:59,025
Mr. Lee, aren't you curious
about anything about me?

535
00:28:00,693 --> 00:28:01,560
Not really.

536
00:28:04,096 --> 00:28:05,398
What do you think you're doing?

537
00:28:05,398 --> 00:28:07,566
I've been talking this whole time
and you're just on your phone.

538
00:28:08,434 --> 00:28:10,403
Sorry, I'm a bit swamped with work.

539
00:28:10,403 --> 00:28:12,171
I think I should get going.

540
00:28:12,171 --> 00:28:12,972
What?

541
00:28:13,673 --> 00:28:14,573
It was nice meeting you.

542
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:22,748
What's wrong with that guy?

543
00:28:29,622 --> 00:28:30,723
Unbelievable.

544
00:28:31,457 --> 00:28:33,192
Why bother coming out at all then?

545
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,195
He checked me out
and decided I wasn't worth it, is that it?

546
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:39,098
He didn't want to waste his time.
Is that it?

547
00:28:48,808 --> 00:28:50,042
Seriously? That bastard.

548
00:28:52,445 --> 00:28:56,415
After we're done, maybe pasta later?

549
00:28:56,415 --> 00:28:57,550
Are you free for dinner?

550
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:58,584
Yes, I'd love that.

551
00:28:59,085 --> 00:29:00,953
- What about wine?
- I love wine too.

552
00:29:00,953 --> 00:29:02,421
Do you like it? I really like it too.

553
00:29:02,421 --> 00:29:03,456
Yes, me too.

554
00:29:08,027 --> 00:29:09,128
What is this?

555
00:29:09,128 --> 00:29:10,997
What do you think you're doing?

556
00:29:11,564 --> 00:29:13,532
You made plans with me not that long ago.

557
00:29:13,532 --> 00:29:14,934
So what are you doing here?

558
00:29:15,768 --> 00:29:17,536
Are you some catalogue model...

559
00:29:17,536 --> 00:29:18,904
from a matchmaking agency?

560
00:29:20,206 --> 00:29:22,208
How many sessions did you sign up for?

561
00:29:22,208 --> 00:29:25,411
Did they push you into a premium package
and talk you into the expensive one?

562
00:29:26,145 --> 00:29:28,247
I hate to say it, but you and I...

563
00:29:28,247 --> 00:29:30,082
totally got scammed.

564
00:29:30,816 --> 00:29:32,018
Really?

565
00:29:32,018 --> 00:29:33,619
No.

566
00:29:33,619 --> 00:29:35,521
What do you think you're doing right now?

567
00:29:35,521 --> 00:29:36,756
Get your hands off me.

568
00:29:37,356 --> 00:29:40,026
You're too cheap to even pay
for a cup of coffee,

569
00:29:40,226 --> 00:29:41,360
and you think you know
what embarrassment is?

570
00:29:42,895 --> 00:29:43,763
Then what about you?

571
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:46,032
You?

572
00:29:46,032 --> 00:29:48,000
You think Photoshop
is going to erase your age?

573
00:29:49,135 --> 00:29:50,603
What's wrong with my age?

574
00:29:50,603 --> 00:29:51,971
It's not like you're young, either.

575
00:29:51,971 --> 00:29:53,472
You can be old,

576
00:29:53,472 --> 00:29:55,775
but I can't? You jerk.

577
00:29:56,475 --> 00:29:59,111
What is with this woman?

578
00:30:00,379 --> 00:30:01,948
- Damn it.
- My neck.

579
00:30:01,948 --> 00:30:02,882
Ms. Woo Joo.

580
00:30:03,182 --> 00:30:03,983
Damn it.

581
00:30:24,003 --> 00:30:25,738
((Ad) You've won a coffee coupon.)

582
00:30:26,272 --> 00:30:27,974
Another stupid ad.

583
00:30:29,875 --> 00:30:31,811
(Naraeng)

584
00:30:31,811 --> 00:30:34,714
Lee Il Ri,
are you really not going to pick up?

585
00:30:44,724 --> 00:30:45,825
Welcome.

586
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,969
One draft beer
and one spicy whelk salad, please.

587
00:30:56,969 --> 00:30:58,504
Yes, just a moment.

588
00:31:04,677 --> 00:31:05,978
Welcome.

589
00:31:05,978 --> 00:31:07,179
- Hello.
- How many are you?

590
00:31:07,179 --> 00:31:08,915
- Five.
- Five.

591
00:31:08,915 --> 00:31:10,950
Over there, one, two, three...

592
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:12,852
She's taking up a big table
all by herself.

593
00:31:12,852 --> 00:31:13,920
There's room here.

594
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,288
Please wait a second.

595
00:31:15,288 --> 00:31:16,355
Let's share the table.

596
00:31:16,355 --> 00:31:17,757
Share with her?

597
00:31:17,757 --> 00:31:18,925
Can't she leave?

598
00:31:18,925 --> 00:31:21,661
I said you sell amazing fried chicken
and brought my friends here.

599
00:31:21,661 --> 00:31:23,029
Just wait a bit.

600
00:31:25,097 --> 00:31:26,198
It's hot.

601
00:31:27,333 --> 00:31:28,834
Why is it so hot in here?

602
00:31:30,169 --> 00:31:32,872
Ma'am, cancel my order.

603
00:31:33,739 --> 00:31:34,840
Make some room for her.

604
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:35,675
I'm sorry, ma'am.

605
00:31:37,209 --> 00:31:38,544
Thank you.

606
00:31:38,544 --> 00:31:40,046
- Hurry.
- Let's sit.

607
00:31:41,948 --> 00:31:44,450
Three fried chickens,
one spicy whelk salad,

608
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:45,551
and five beers, please.

609
00:31:47,587 --> 00:31:48,421
This looks so good.

610
00:31:48,688 --> 00:31:50,990
- I told you it was good.
- It looks amazing.

611
00:32:17,617 --> 00:32:18,351
Il Ri.

612
00:32:29,695 --> 00:32:30,463
Are you okay?

613
00:32:37,069 --> 00:32:38,037
Did something happen?

614
00:33:00,793 --> 00:33:03,362
Hey, slow down.

615
00:33:04,096 --> 00:33:06,232
Are you possessed or something?
Why are you eating so fast?

616
00:33:12,972 --> 00:33:14,307
I feel much better.

617
00:33:22,515 --> 00:33:23,983
No.

618
00:33:24,884 --> 00:33:26,218
I'm sorry, dude.

619
00:33:26,619 --> 00:33:28,287
Why am I so clumsy?

620
00:33:28,287 --> 00:33:31,791
I knew that would happen.
That's why I gave you my jacket.

621
00:33:32,291 --> 00:33:34,293
Ever since you were in school,

622
00:33:34,293 --> 00:33:36,762
you were always wearing
whatever you ate on your clothes.

623
00:33:36,762 --> 00:33:38,898
Tteokbokki, spicy seafood noodle soup,
and so on.

624
00:33:39,198 --> 00:33:40,099
Stop.

625
00:33:42,969 --> 00:33:45,338
Now talk to me.

626
00:33:46,806 --> 00:33:47,807
What's going on?

627
00:33:48,474 --> 00:33:50,176
What happened?

628
00:33:50,176 --> 00:33:52,011
Why were you crying like a kid
out in the streets?

629
00:33:53,212 --> 00:33:54,146
Well,

630
00:33:55,815 --> 00:33:57,483
I fought with Na Jeong.

631
00:33:58,751 --> 00:34:00,886
What? And here I thought
it was something big.

632
00:34:02,121 --> 00:34:04,423
You guys are old enough now,
and you're still fighting?

633
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:06,325
Whatever. You don't know what happened.

634
00:34:15,001 --> 00:34:16,736
Look at you.

635
00:34:20,406 --> 00:34:21,607
Look at the way he's eating.

636
00:34:22,575 --> 00:34:23,542
He eats way too much.

637
00:34:24,944 --> 00:34:26,612
Isn't Jae Hyeon hilarious?

638
00:34:26,612 --> 00:34:27,747
Totally.

639
00:34:28,147 --> 00:34:31,651
How does he make it look so delicious
when he eats?

640
00:34:31,651 --> 00:34:33,686
He's going to be huge, I'm telling you.

641
00:34:33,686 --> 00:34:36,622
He's already quite taller
than other kids his age.

642
00:34:36,622 --> 00:34:38,257
And Joo Hyeon sees that...

643
00:34:38,257 --> 00:34:41,594
and keeps eating like crazy,
saying she has to grow as tall as him.

644
00:34:42,261 --> 00:34:44,730
I really have to make a lot of money.

645
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:46,332
Work hard and feed them well.

646
00:34:46,332 --> 00:34:48,134
That's the greatest joy...

647
00:34:48,968 --> 00:34:51,637
and the best investment there is.

648
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:54,907
Joo Young.

649
00:34:55,441 --> 00:34:56,909
Do you even look at my Instagram?

650
00:34:58,611 --> 00:34:59,612
What are you talking about?

651
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,517
You never leave any comments.

652
00:35:05,418 --> 00:35:08,054
You post in the group chat every day.
Do I have to leave comments as well?

653
00:35:08,487 --> 00:35:10,056
They're different.

654
00:35:11,157 --> 00:35:13,659
Don't you find
your nephew and niece adorable?

655
00:35:14,994 --> 00:35:16,329
What are you trying to say?

656
00:35:17,363 --> 00:35:20,733
They say you have to be jealous of kids...

657
00:35:20,733 --> 00:35:23,536
for you to have one of your own.

658
00:35:23,536 --> 00:35:26,606
Then you'll try harder, right?
Be more proactive.

659
00:35:26,606 --> 00:35:27,707
That's enough.

660
00:35:28,341 --> 00:35:29,976
She must be frustrated already.

661
00:35:33,279 --> 00:35:34,447
So...

662
00:35:34,447 --> 00:35:36,782
what exactly is the problem, Joo Young?

663
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:39,719
Is it that Sang Min can't perform?

664
00:35:40,386 --> 00:35:41,887
Or are you the problem?

665
00:35:43,322 --> 00:35:44,924
I'll head out first. You finish eating.

666
00:35:44,924 --> 00:35:46,158
Mom, I'm leaving.

667
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,161
Thanks for the meal.

668
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:54,200
How much is it?

669
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,534
It's 170 dollars.

670
00:35:58,304 --> 00:35:59,272
Just a moment.

671
00:36:03,342 --> 00:36:06,746
I'm telling you,
that means the problem is her husband.

672
00:36:06,746 --> 00:36:07,613
Why?

673
00:36:08,014 --> 00:36:11,083
Otherwise, why would Joo Young
always be so on edge?

674
00:36:12,285 --> 00:36:14,553
They say there are tons of guys in IT...

675
00:36:14,887 --> 00:36:18,324
with problems down there.

676
00:36:19,425 --> 00:36:22,295
She can't satisfy her desire
nor have kids.

677
00:36:22,561 --> 00:36:25,131
How frustrating must that be?

678
00:36:25,131 --> 00:36:27,800
See, what did I say?

679
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,603
I told you the problem wasn't Joo Young.
It was her husband.

680
00:36:30,903 --> 00:36:32,872
This is exactly why I said...

681
00:36:32,872 --> 00:36:36,208
I had a bad feeling
about guys who collect toys.

682
00:36:36,208 --> 00:36:37,543
Exactly.

683
00:36:37,543 --> 00:36:40,680
I didn't like him
from the moment I saw him, either.

684
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:45,084
What did you just say?

685
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:47,053
Say that again.

686
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,822
Why are you calling
a perfectly healthy man impotent?

687
00:36:49,822 --> 00:36:51,591
Joo Young, that's not what I meant.

688
00:36:51,591 --> 00:36:52,558
Our marriage...

689
00:36:53,125 --> 00:36:54,727
has no problems.

690
00:36:54,727 --> 00:36:57,063
Sang Min is so nice to me.

691
00:36:57,063 --> 00:36:58,931
And I have zero complaints.

692
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:02,501
Just because we're having a baby later,
do you think you can make up crap?

693
00:37:02,902 --> 00:37:04,236
Are we that easy to you?

694
00:37:04,236 --> 00:37:07,039
Why are you getting so touchy?

695
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:08,808
It's not even that big a deal.

696
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:16,048
He really is impotent.

697
00:37:16,048 --> 00:37:16,983
Shut up.

698
00:37:47,713 --> 00:37:49,515
Open the door. It's me.

699
00:37:53,219 --> 00:37:55,454
I know you're in there. Open up!

700
00:38:20,846 --> 00:38:22,048
Why aren't you coming home?

701
00:38:25,084 --> 00:38:26,819
Are you just going to keep living here?

702
00:38:26,819 --> 00:38:27,820
With them?

703
00:38:31,557 --> 00:38:32,391
Fine.

704
00:38:33,659 --> 00:38:35,695
I didn't come here to fight, so I'll stop.

705
00:38:38,264 --> 00:38:39,231
Rebecca.

706
00:38:40,866 --> 00:38:42,268
I'm sorry I broke her arm.

707
00:38:43,069 --> 00:38:45,304
But think about it from my side.

708
00:38:45,638 --> 00:38:47,907
It's not even a little figure,
but a huge mannequin.

709
00:38:48,541 --> 00:38:50,142
It was just too creepy.

710
00:38:50,142 --> 00:38:52,111
And if something's bothering you,
you can talk to me.

711
00:38:52,111 --> 00:38:53,546
Why are you talking to a doll?

712
00:38:53,846 --> 00:38:56,349
Why are you being like this?

713
00:38:56,816 --> 00:38:58,718
Say something!

714
00:39:04,123 --> 00:39:06,292
Okay, fine.

715
00:39:07,526 --> 00:39:10,896
But the reason I came here is to say this.

716
00:39:12,331 --> 00:39:14,667
We should go to the hospital.

717
00:39:15,668 --> 00:39:16,902
From what I can see,

718
00:39:16,902 --> 00:39:19,305
I think you're hurt inside.

719
00:39:20,006 --> 00:39:22,174
These days, if you get checked out
and get treatment,

720
00:39:22,174 --> 00:39:23,643
they say most things can be fixed.

721
00:39:23,643 --> 00:39:25,745
So let's go together, okay?

722
00:39:32,385 --> 00:39:33,386
Why?

723
00:39:35,688 --> 00:39:37,790
Does it feel like I'm treating you
like you're crazy?

724
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:38,758
Does that upset you?

725
00:39:40,126 --> 00:39:41,727
It's not that.

726
00:39:42,495 --> 00:39:45,398
I'm doing this
because I want to help you any way I can.

727
00:39:59,912 --> 00:40:01,747
I'm so sorry to tell you this,

728
00:40:02,949 --> 00:40:03,916
but...

729
00:40:06,085 --> 00:40:08,220
don't ask me anything,
and just divorce me.

730
00:40:09,522 --> 00:40:10,456
What?

731
00:40:14,126 --> 00:40:15,361
What's wrong with you?

732
00:40:16,562 --> 00:40:17,797
I'm saying I'll forgive you.

733
00:40:17,797 --> 00:40:19,832
What right do you have
to be the one bringing up divorce?

734
00:40:22,568 --> 00:40:23,469
You're right.

735
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:25,304
I know I don't have the right.

736
00:40:25,605 --> 00:40:28,708
Like you said,
I'm not even in my right mind.

737
00:40:29,875 --> 00:40:31,811
But living with you...

738
00:40:34,714 --> 00:40:35,982
felt suffocating.

739
00:40:37,049 --> 00:40:39,185
All you cared about was pregnancy.

740
00:40:39,185 --> 00:40:40,453
What am I,
some kind of baby-making machine?

741
00:40:41,287 --> 00:40:42,154
Am I?

742
00:40:43,522 --> 00:40:44,624
I really...

743
00:40:46,659 --> 00:40:48,160
It really felt
like I was going to lose my mind.

744
00:41:31,671 --> 00:41:33,039
(You have a new notification.)

745
00:41:33,039 --> 00:41:35,641
(Ovulation day,
High chance of pregnancy)

746
00:42:14,046 --> 00:42:17,550
My time has passed now.

747
00:42:18,417 --> 00:42:20,219
It's completely over.

748
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,556
All that's left for me now...

749
00:42:24,423 --> 00:42:26,292
is to become a lonely old person...

750
00:42:26,792 --> 00:42:29,362
and die alone in an empty home.

751
00:42:29,362 --> 00:42:32,932
You've got your whole future ahead of you.
Why do you say such depressing things?

752
00:42:32,932 --> 00:42:33,866
Dude.

753
00:42:35,534 --> 00:42:37,303
When I die,

754
00:42:38,504 --> 00:42:40,806
since you live right across from me,

755
00:42:42,341 --> 00:42:44,510
before I rot away completely,

756
00:42:45,478 --> 00:42:46,979
before I'm completely gone,

757
00:42:47,847 --> 00:42:50,449
will you bury me somewhere sunny?

758
00:42:51,417 --> 00:42:52,551
I knew this would happen.

759
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,489
I knew you'd cause trouble.
Wait right here, okay?

760
00:43:05,097 --> 00:43:05,932
What?

761
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,801
Did you just laugh at me?

762
00:43:10,503 --> 00:43:11,404
Why?

763
00:43:12,104 --> 00:43:13,105
Do I look funny to you?

764
00:43:14,407 --> 00:43:16,442
What exactly is so funny?

765
00:43:18,311 --> 00:43:20,646
- I'm sorry, she's just a bit...
- Hold on a second.

766
00:43:20,646 --> 00:43:22,148
I definitely heard you.

767
00:43:22,982 --> 00:43:24,917
You said, "That woman is hilarious."

768
00:43:24,917 --> 00:43:26,018
That's enough.

769
00:43:26,018 --> 00:43:28,955
Why did you call me hilarious?

770
00:43:28,955 --> 00:43:29,956
All right.

771
00:43:29,956 --> 00:43:32,091
I'm sorry. She's not well.

772
00:43:32,258 --> 00:43:33,726
Let's go, Lee Il Ri.
Let's go home.

773
00:43:33,726 --> 00:43:36,028
Hey, where do you think you're going?

774
00:43:36,028 --> 00:43:37,229
Where do you think you're going?

775
00:43:37,229 --> 00:43:39,231
I'm a fighter, you know.

776
00:43:39,231 --> 00:43:40,700
- She's really not well.
- Hey.

777
00:43:41,701 --> 00:43:42,702
Hey!

778
00:43:45,638 --> 00:43:47,006
Young lady.

779
00:43:47,006 --> 00:43:49,208
Just tell me the door code, will you?

780
00:43:49,208 --> 00:43:51,611
Nope, I don't want to.
I'm not telling you.

781
00:43:51,611 --> 00:43:54,847
What if I tell you, and you just walk in
whenever you feel like it?

782
00:43:54,847 --> 00:43:56,449
Then I'll just drag you over
to my place instead.

783
00:43:56,449 --> 00:43:58,818
No way.

784
00:43:59,085 --> 00:44:01,787
You've got ulterior motives
with me, don't you?

785
00:44:01,787 --> 00:44:03,489
Since when?

786
00:44:03,489 --> 00:44:04,957
You animal.

787
00:44:08,461 --> 00:44:11,130
But what cologne do you use?

788
00:44:12,198 --> 00:44:13,466
Why are you like this again?

789
00:44:14,834 --> 00:44:15,935
It smells nice.

790
00:44:15,935 --> 00:44:18,004
Right, even back then,

791
00:44:18,004 --> 00:44:20,373
I always made you give me piggybacks
because I liked this scent.

792
00:44:21,173 --> 00:44:22,575
I remember.

793
00:44:23,442 --> 00:44:24,610
How nice.

794
00:44:25,278 --> 00:44:26,712
Hey, please.

795
00:44:26,712 --> 00:44:29,248
Just punch in the code!

796
00:44:29,815 --> 00:44:31,651
Hey, where are we?

797
00:44:32,518 --> 00:44:34,587
Where did you bring me?

798
00:44:34,587 --> 00:44:36,155
We're home now.

799
00:44:44,463 --> 00:44:45,731
Finally.

800
00:44:46,399 --> 00:44:48,034
You're heavier than when you were a kid.

801
00:44:51,003 --> 00:44:53,706
Hey, are you taking my shoes off?

802
00:44:54,373 --> 00:44:56,309
These are designers, you know.

803
00:44:56,309 --> 00:44:57,209
Wait.

804
00:44:58,144 --> 00:44:59,979
These are really expensive.

805
00:44:59,979 --> 00:45:00,680
Got it.

806
00:45:01,213 --> 00:45:03,049
- Don't steal them.
- I won't.

807
00:45:08,955 --> 00:45:09,789
Hang on.

808
00:45:10,489 --> 00:45:11,390
Let's move up.

809
00:45:22,168 --> 00:45:24,337
You really haven't changed at all.

810
00:45:25,805 --> 00:45:27,340
Hey, Byeon Sang Gyu.

811
00:45:27,907 --> 00:45:29,308
You like me, don't you?

812
00:45:31,644 --> 00:45:32,578
What are you saying?

813
00:45:33,145 --> 00:45:34,947
You're really drunk right now.

814
00:45:34,947 --> 00:45:36,616
Let's talk tomorrow
when you're sober, okay?

815
00:45:36,616 --> 00:45:38,684
Let me say this one more time.

816
00:45:39,352 --> 00:45:40,886
I don't like you.

817
00:45:41,654 --> 00:45:44,657
But I feel really lonely today.

818
00:45:45,658 --> 00:45:46,492
Wait.

819
00:46:05,745 --> 00:46:07,413
You don't have to like me right now.

820
00:46:08,948 --> 00:46:10,182
Because I'm going to make you fall for me.

821
00:46:30,503 --> 00:46:33,105
(Sweet Home Shopping)

822
00:46:34,573 --> 00:46:36,042
Good morning.

823
00:46:36,475 --> 00:46:38,210
- What do I do?
- It's okay.

824
00:46:38,210 --> 00:46:40,713
It's okay. These things happen.

825
00:46:41,747 --> 00:46:42,915
Don't cry.

826
00:46:43,749 --> 00:46:45,117
Don't cry over something like this.

827
00:46:45,618 --> 00:46:46,819
What happened?

828
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:48,621
Ask her yourself.

829
00:46:48,621 --> 00:46:49,488
Let's go.

830
00:46:56,796 --> 00:46:58,197
Did something happen?

831
00:46:59,665 --> 00:47:01,834
The producer told her
to leave right away...

832
00:47:01,834 --> 00:47:03,035
for ruining the broadcast.

833
00:47:03,402 --> 00:47:04,337
What?

834
00:47:04,637 --> 00:47:06,739
This is all because of you.

835
00:47:06,739 --> 00:47:09,308
If you hadn't told those stupid lies,
we wouldn't have gotten on the bad side,

836
00:47:09,308 --> 00:47:11,844
and we wouldn't have been thrown on air
so suddenly like this.

837
00:47:11,844 --> 00:47:13,613
How is that my fault?

838
00:47:14,447 --> 00:47:15,615
And...

839
00:47:15,615 --> 00:47:18,284
you're the ones
who wanted to be on air more.

840
00:47:18,284 --> 00:47:21,220
It's not like I wanted to go in
this unprepared.

841
00:47:22,488 --> 00:47:24,056
Ms. Cho, it's your fault.

842
00:47:24,357 --> 00:47:26,993
Because of you,
everyone at the company hates us now.

843
00:47:28,227 --> 00:47:30,429
What are we supposed to do?

844
00:47:35,268 --> 00:47:37,236
What am I supposed to do?

845
00:47:38,738 --> 00:47:39,438
It's okay.

846
00:47:39,438 --> 00:47:42,208

847
00:47:48,447 --> 00:47:51,083
(Sanmaeul Fermented Soybean Stew)

848
00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:06,332
You're all ready, right?

849
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:09,435
Since it's Ms. Yang's first broadcast,

850
00:48:09,435 --> 00:48:10,770
don't try to do too much.

851
00:48:10,770 --> 00:48:12,939
And don't miss a single word
of my instructions.

852
00:48:12,939 --> 00:48:14,640
Even if you hear something in your in-ear,

853
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,309
don't lose your focus.

854
00:48:16,309 --> 00:48:17,310
Okay.

855
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:19,378
All right, let's go.

856
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:22,715
We're live in five seconds.

857
00:48:27,053 --> 00:48:29,855
Three, two, one.

858
00:48:31,057 --> 00:48:31,958
Welcome.

859
00:48:31,958 --> 00:48:34,060
This is delicious
Sanmaeul Fermented Soybean Stew.

860
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:35,461
I'm Hong Seon Young.

861
00:48:35,461 --> 00:48:37,897
And I'm show host Yang Mi Sook.

862
00:48:37,897 --> 00:48:40,833
Lately, with the trend
toward healthy foods,

863
00:48:40,833 --> 00:48:43,936
what food is getting the most attention?

864
00:48:43,936 --> 00:48:46,305
Fermented soybean stew.

865
00:48:46,305 --> 00:48:47,873
As a dish with high protein
and low calories,

866
00:48:47,873 --> 00:48:50,343
it's popular with everyone,
men and women, young and old.

867
00:48:50,343 --> 00:48:52,878
And as a fermented food,
it's incredibly good for your health.

868
00:48:52,878 --> 00:48:54,680
Since it's hard to make at home,

869
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:57,049
if you stock up in your fridge now,

870
00:48:57,049 --> 00:48:58,651
you'll feel completely set.

871
00:48:58,651 --> 00:48:59,852
Yes, so...

872
00:48:59,852 --> 00:49:01,387
And if you look here,

873
00:49:01,387 --> 00:49:04,790
we've specially prepared
Sanmaeul Fermented Soybean Stew today.

874
00:49:04,790 --> 00:49:07,693
You all know you could only get this
in stores until now, right?

875
00:49:07,693 --> 00:49:10,329
Ms. Yang, you're talking way too fast.

876
00:49:10,963 --> 00:49:12,331
And you're talking way more
than the main host.

877
00:49:12,999 --> 00:49:14,834
Let's look here.

878
00:49:14,834 --> 00:49:17,336
The most important thing
about fermented soybean stew...

879
00:49:17,336 --> 00:49:18,671
is the ingredient.

880
00:49:18,904 --> 00:49:21,040
Now, what kind of soybean is this?

881
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,709
It's said to have been served
on the king's royal table long ago.

882
00:49:23,709 --> 00:49:26,078
The famous Jangdan soybean from Paju.

883
00:49:26,078 --> 00:49:30,149
It's 100 percent domestically grown,
pure soybean.

884
00:49:30,149 --> 00:49:31,317
Ms. Yang, can't you hear me?

885
00:49:32,218 --> 00:49:34,120
Why are you acting out
when you're the co-host?

886
00:49:34,654 --> 00:49:35,521
I'm sorry.

887
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:42,828
And we take those Jangdan soybeans...

888
00:49:42,828 --> 00:49:46,465
and boil them in a cauldron like this
for about two hours,

889
00:49:46,465 --> 00:49:49,402
then let them steam
for about three and a half hours.

890
00:49:49,402 --> 00:49:52,038
And then ferment them on a warm floor,

891
00:49:55,608 --> 00:49:56,542
and look at this.

892
00:49:56,542 --> 00:49:58,844
Do you see these pale white strands?

893
00:50:01,314 --> 00:50:02,181
Okay.

894
00:50:03,883 --> 00:50:05,251
Shall we try some?

895
00:50:05,251 --> 00:50:08,120
It looks so delicious. I'll try some too.

896
00:50:09,155 --> 00:50:10,089
Yes.

897
00:50:17,663 --> 00:50:18,798
Don't spit it out.

898
00:50:18,798 --> 00:50:21,033
Swallow it!

899
00:50:21,033 --> 00:50:21,767
Please.

900
00:50:33,079 --> 00:50:34,380
Do you think broadcasting is a joke?

901
00:50:35,248 --> 00:50:37,183
The comment section
is blowing up right now.

902
00:50:37,717 --> 00:50:39,752
They're saying this is like a comedy,
not a home shopping show.

903
00:50:40,253 --> 00:50:43,656
They're saying they've never seen
someone spit food out like that,

904
00:50:43,656 --> 00:50:45,591
and that it was so disgusting!

905
00:50:47,159 --> 00:50:50,363
And why did you do the show by yourself?

906
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:53,165
Did you forget that I'm the main host,
and you're the co-host?

907
00:50:53,699 --> 00:50:55,868
We're supposed to work together,

908
00:50:55,868 --> 00:50:57,536
but you're just desperate to stand out!

909
00:50:58,104 --> 00:51:01,107
Do you have any idea how uncomfortable
that makes the viewers?

910
00:51:02,108 --> 00:51:03,175
How are you going...

911
00:51:03,442 --> 00:51:06,178
to take responsibility for this outcome?

912
00:51:39,078 --> 00:51:40,980
Hello.

913
00:51:42,114 --> 00:51:43,449
Hello.

914
00:51:43,449 --> 00:51:45,518
- You're here for the kids today.
- Yes.

915
00:51:45,518 --> 00:51:46,852
- Just a moment.
- Okay.

916
00:52:01,233 --> 00:52:02,101
Mom.

917
00:52:02,101 --> 00:52:03,269
- Mom.
- Hey.

918
00:52:04,070 --> 00:52:07,173
Mom, can we go play
on the playground first?

919
00:52:07,173 --> 00:52:07,907
Sure.

920
00:52:11,010 --> 00:52:12,211
- Thank you.
- Sure.

921
00:52:15,781 --> 00:52:16,949
Hello.

922
00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:19,952
Whose father are you, if I may ask?

923
00:52:19,952 --> 00:52:21,787
I'm Joo Ri Ae's dad.

924
00:52:21,787 --> 00:52:23,256
My wife had to work, so I came.

925
00:52:24,357 --> 00:52:26,125
Just a moment.

926
00:52:31,230 --> 00:52:32,465
You're kind of cute.

927
00:52:32,832 --> 00:52:34,767
My wife is in a meeting.

928
00:52:34,767 --> 00:52:36,369
She told me not to call her.

929
00:52:37,169 --> 00:52:38,738
But still...

930
00:52:39,772 --> 00:52:40,940
You don't believe me?

931
00:52:41,474 --> 00:52:44,243
She's in an important meeting right now
and told me not to call at all.

932
00:52:46,479 --> 00:52:48,514
But under kindergarten rules,

933
00:52:48,514 --> 00:52:51,317
we can't let a child go
without the mother's consent.

934
00:52:53,586 --> 00:52:56,822
Look, her mom had work to do.

935
00:52:56,822 --> 00:52:58,224
That's why she sent me.

936
00:52:59,025 --> 00:53:00,760
If you're really that worried,

937
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:03,229
bring Ri Ae out and let her see me.

938
00:53:03,229 --> 00:53:05,631
If she says she doesn't want to go,
I'll just leave.

939
00:53:06,832 --> 00:53:07,967
Just a moment.

940
00:53:14,607 --> 00:53:16,776
But Ri Ae says
she doesn't want to go to China.

941
00:53:16,776 --> 00:53:17,944
She says her stepmom is scary.

942
00:53:25,017 --> 00:53:26,285
The power is currently off...

943
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:30,690
Dad?

944
00:53:32,091 --> 00:53:34,193
My sweet girl.

945
00:53:37,997 --> 00:53:39,498
Didn't you miss me?

946
00:53:39,498 --> 00:53:41,067
I missed you.

947
00:53:42,001 --> 00:53:43,102
Do you believe me now?

948
00:53:44,637 --> 00:53:46,138
I told you, I'm Ri Ae's dad.

949
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:48,407
Let's go!

950
00:53:51,677 --> 00:53:55,147
You're the delivery guy from Hanmae-dong,
Joo Cheol Geun, right?

951
00:53:55,781 --> 00:53:57,350
Nice to see you.

952
00:53:58,384 --> 00:53:59,218
Who are you?

953
00:53:59,218 --> 00:54:01,887
Me? I'm Cho Na Jeong
from Hanmae Middle School.

954
00:54:02,888 --> 00:54:04,757
Sorry, I don't remember.

955
00:54:04,757 --> 00:54:06,726
How can you not remember?

956
00:54:06,726 --> 00:54:08,594
You asked me to go to karaoke with you,

957
00:54:08,594 --> 00:54:11,631
and Mi Sook got mad
and grabbed my hair and we fought.

958
00:54:13,132 --> 00:54:14,800
I'm telling you, I don't know you.

959
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,936
Anyway, how have you been all this time?

960
00:54:16,936 --> 00:54:18,004
Have you been well?

961
00:54:18,237 --> 00:54:20,539
But does Ri Ae's mom even know...

962
00:54:20,539 --> 00:54:22,508
you're taking her?

963
00:54:23,175 --> 00:54:24,877
Sir, I'm sorry,

964
00:54:24,877 --> 00:54:26,479
but you should talk to the mother first,

965
00:54:26,479 --> 00:54:28,214
and then take her.

966
00:54:29,548 --> 00:54:32,285
What kind of nonsense is this?
Get out of my way.

967
00:54:34,453 --> 00:54:35,922
Moms, perfect timing.

968
00:54:35,922 --> 00:54:38,658
He's trying to kidnap a child.
Please hold on to him.

969
00:54:38,658 --> 00:54:39,592
Police!

970
00:54:40,226 --> 00:54:41,727
- Let go.
- Call the police.

971
00:54:43,329 --> 00:54:44,263
Hold him tight.

972
00:54:44,263 --> 00:54:45,765
That's it, hold him tight.

973
00:54:46,933 --> 00:54:48,267
Back off, you crazy woman.

974
00:54:53,306 --> 00:54:55,308
What do you think you're doing right now?

975
00:54:55,708 --> 00:54:57,843
Why are you dragging in
someone who's done nothing wrong?

976
00:54:57,843 --> 00:54:59,845
I'm the kid's father,
and I want to take her with me.

977
00:54:59,845 --> 00:55:01,314
What's wrong with that?

978
00:55:01,314 --> 00:55:04,250
There's nothing wrong
with a dad taking his kid.

979
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:05,818
But you live overseas now, don't you?

980
00:55:05,818 --> 00:55:07,620
If you take her
without even telling her mom,

981
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:09,889
that's a problem.

982
00:55:11,691 --> 00:55:14,260
And where did this random nobody
crawl out from?

983
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:15,428
Will you shut up?

984
00:55:16,062 --> 00:55:17,196
Who are you calling a nobody?

985
00:55:17,496 --> 00:55:19,899
Calm down.

986
00:55:19,899 --> 00:55:20,666
Please sit down.

987
00:55:21,834 --> 00:55:22,635
Mi Sook.

988
00:55:25,171 --> 00:55:27,340
You bastard, who are you to take my kid?

989
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:28,774
Who do you think you are?

990
00:55:28,774 --> 00:55:30,409
I told you to leave my daughter alone.

991
00:55:30,409 --> 00:55:32,378
I told you to leave my daughter alone!

992
00:55:32,378 --> 00:55:34,113
Are you crazy?

993
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:36,482
Is Ri Ae only your daughter?

994
00:55:36,482 --> 00:55:37,984
She's my daughter too.

995
00:55:39,652 --> 00:55:41,954
A guy who lets his kid
watch him beat her mom every day?

996
00:55:41,954 --> 00:55:43,656
What kind of father does that?

997
00:55:43,656 --> 00:55:47,059
A guy who doesn't pay a single penny
in living expenses? How is that a father?

998
00:55:47,693 --> 00:55:51,664
Where did you stash my hard-earned money?

999
00:55:51,664 --> 00:55:53,065
Bring me my money!

1000
00:55:53,065 --> 00:55:55,101
Give me my money, you bastard.

1001
00:55:55,101 --> 00:55:56,269
Give me my money.

1002
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:57,270
Damn it.

1003
00:55:59,005 --> 00:56:00,640
- Mi Sook.
- Damn it.

1004
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:01,941
Are you okay?

1005
00:56:03,809 --> 00:56:04,944
Let go of me.

1006
00:56:05,645 --> 00:56:06,679
You!

1007
00:56:20,626 --> 00:56:21,494
Here.

1008
00:56:24,931 --> 00:56:26,098
Right, where's Ri Ae?

1009
00:56:26,565 --> 00:56:28,367
She's fine with our nanny.

1010
00:56:28,367 --> 00:56:29,402
Don't worry.

1011
00:56:30,336 --> 00:56:31,203
Thanks.

1012
00:56:39,211 --> 00:56:42,148
He's Joo Cheol Geun from back then, right?

1013
00:56:46,586 --> 00:56:47,453
Yeah, that's him.

1014
00:56:48,287 --> 00:56:50,056
This is so humiliating.

1015
00:56:50,056 --> 00:56:51,857
Picking trash like that
and calling him my husband.

1016
00:56:51,857 --> 00:56:54,193
I really must have been blind.

1017
00:56:55,294 --> 00:56:56,696
Why?

1018
00:56:56,696 --> 00:56:58,230
You got married, ran a business together,

1019
00:56:58,230 --> 00:56:59,732
and made a lot of money.

1020
00:57:00,199 --> 00:57:01,601
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

1021
00:57:02,301 --> 00:57:03,536
A lot of money?

1022
00:57:05,705 --> 00:57:08,808
Hey, I earned all of that
doing live commerce.

1023
00:57:08,808 --> 00:57:10,576
That jerk didn't do a thing.

1024
00:57:10,576 --> 00:57:12,812
But you know what's really unbelievable?

1025
00:57:14,146 --> 00:57:17,316
That piece of trash
went crazy over some woman...

1026
00:57:17,316 --> 00:57:19,986
and siphoned off every last bit
of the money I earned and all our assets.

1027
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:23,022
And you know what's even more absurd?

1028
00:57:23,322 --> 00:57:24,957
No matter how awful he is,

1029
00:57:25,524 --> 00:57:27,460
if I don't have a proper job,

1030
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:29,428
they say they'll send her to her dad.

1031
00:57:29,428 --> 00:57:31,297
They say there's nothing they can do.

1032
00:57:32,365 --> 00:57:34,867
That's why I was so desperate
to get into Sweet Home Shopping.

1033
00:57:37,436 --> 00:57:40,806
But what am I supposed to do now?

1034
00:57:40,806 --> 00:57:44,076
At this rate,
it's obvious I'm going to get fired.

1035
00:57:45,978 --> 00:57:47,013
Damn it.

1036
00:57:49,916 --> 00:57:50,950
If...

1037
00:57:51,918 --> 00:57:53,819
they really take Ri Ae away from me,

1038
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,856
how am I supposed to live on, Na Jeong?

1039
00:57:57,823 --> 00:57:59,959
How am I supposed to go on?

1040
00:58:02,595 --> 00:58:04,597
Damn it.

1041
00:58:15,174 --> 00:58:18,444
Last time, because Ms. Cho showed up,

1042
00:58:18,444 --> 00:58:20,079
I couldn't properly apologize.

1043
00:58:21,914 --> 00:58:22,915
I'm sorry.

1044
00:58:26,152 --> 00:58:29,155
But when I even got rejected
from Samjin Shopping as my last shot,

1045
00:58:29,722 --> 00:58:30,690
it just felt so unfair.

1046
00:58:32,224 --> 00:58:35,428
Still, I'm not going to stop here.

1047
00:58:36,262 --> 00:58:38,230
I'll fight it all the way to the end.

1048
00:58:38,898 --> 00:58:40,533
It took so much for me
to become a show host.

1049
00:58:40,833 --> 00:58:43,603
I can't just let myself be branded
like this and get destroyed.

1050
00:58:45,004 --> 00:58:46,105
Right, Producer Noh?

1051
00:58:49,241 --> 00:58:51,510
Seon Min, I'm sorry.

1052
00:58:53,412 --> 00:58:55,681
I don't think I can help you anymore.

1053
00:58:57,817 --> 00:59:00,353
I know full well
how hard things are for you.

1054
00:59:00,987 --> 00:59:02,688
But the pressure from the company
is just too much.

1055
00:59:03,389 --> 00:59:05,891
I was ready to take it if they fired me.

1056
00:59:05,891 --> 00:59:07,526
I thought I could handle that somehow.

1057
00:59:09,095 --> 00:59:11,430
But they said they'd fire my wife too.

1058
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:16,502
I'm really sorry.

1059
00:59:17,970 --> 00:59:19,205
No, Producer Noh.

1060
00:59:21,007 --> 00:59:22,675
I completely understand.

1061
00:59:22,975 --> 00:59:26,145
Anyone else would've just looked
the other way,

1062
00:59:27,713 --> 00:59:28,814
but you helped me out, Producer Noh.

1063
00:59:29,949 --> 00:59:32,385
I know how much you've helped me
up to now.

1064
00:59:37,556 --> 00:59:40,226
I'm sorry,
I forgot I had another appointment.

1065
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:42,028
I'll get going first.

1066
00:59:46,399 --> 00:59:47,600
I never got to return this back then.

1067
00:59:49,568 --> 00:59:50,603
I'll see you next time.

1068
01:00:02,248 --> 01:00:05,484
If I don't have a proper job,
they'll send her to her dad.

1069
01:00:05,484 --> 01:00:07,453
They say she doesn't need some "good mom."

1070
01:00:15,895 --> 01:00:17,163
Mom, look at this.

1071
01:00:18,230 --> 01:00:19,298
What's this?

1072
01:00:19,632 --> 01:00:20,866
A present for Ri Ae.

1073
01:00:24,937 --> 01:00:27,206
But Mom, is Ri Ae going to China now?

1074
01:00:28,908 --> 01:00:30,943
No, who said that?

1075
01:00:31,477 --> 01:00:33,412
But Ri Ae's dad came today.

1076
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:36,249
Do I have to say goodbye to her now?

1077
01:00:39,118 --> 01:00:40,253
No.

1078
01:00:45,391 --> 01:00:47,793
You did an amazing job. It's so pretty.

1079
01:00:56,802 --> 01:00:57,703
Here.

1080
01:00:59,238 --> 01:01:00,072
What's this?

1081
01:01:00,072 --> 01:01:03,743
They are some tips I've thought
were important.

1082
01:01:03,743 --> 01:01:05,978
I've been jotting them down for a while.

1083
01:01:05,978 --> 01:01:07,813
I thought it might help
if you looked through it.

1084
01:01:08,247 --> 01:01:09,115
Take a look.

1085
01:01:10,816 --> 01:01:11,751
Hey, Cho Na Jeong.

1086
01:01:12,251 --> 01:01:13,085
Yeah?

1087
01:01:14,153 --> 01:01:16,155
Why are you doing this for me?

1088
01:01:16,856 --> 01:01:18,691
If I fail,
it only works out better for you.

1089
01:01:19,091 --> 01:01:20,293
So why are you doing this for me?

1090
01:01:21,961 --> 01:01:24,297
Sure, I kind of resent you.

1091
01:01:25,197 --> 01:01:26,132
But...

1092
01:01:26,465 --> 01:01:28,668
I want to protect my son's girlfriend.
That's why.

1093
01:01:29,368 --> 01:01:30,202
Okay?

1094
01:01:34,774 --> 01:01:38,377
Can you just teach me yourself?

1095
01:01:39,078 --> 01:01:39,912
What?

1096
01:01:40,179 --> 01:01:42,848
Don't you remember?
I was terrible at studying.

1097
01:01:43,916 --> 01:01:46,652
And how am I supposed
to go through all this on my own?

1098
01:01:56,696 --> 01:01:57,663
Here.

1099
01:01:57,663 --> 01:02:00,199
If I pass on the tricks I used the most,
here's what I'd say.

1100
01:02:00,199 --> 01:02:01,634
When you're doing a food show,

1101
01:02:01,634 --> 01:02:03,536
because the food
has been simmering forever,

1102
01:02:03,536 --> 01:02:05,271
it's insanely hot.

1103
01:02:05,271 --> 01:02:07,073
First, scoop up one spoonful.

1104
01:02:07,073 --> 01:02:08,841
Then start your lines.

1105
01:02:08,841 --> 01:02:11,477
While you're talking,
it'll naturally cool down.

1106
01:02:11,477 --> 01:02:13,546
At least you won't have to worry
about burning yourself.

1107
01:02:13,546 --> 01:02:15,615
I didn't even know that.

1108
01:02:15,615 --> 01:02:17,717
And when you explain a product,

1109
01:02:17,717 --> 01:02:20,019
you don't need long-winded explanations
or anything.

1110
01:02:20,019 --> 01:02:21,787
Out of everything you feel about it,

1111
01:02:21,787 --> 01:02:23,856
pick the one point
that would tempt you the most,

1112
01:02:23,856 --> 01:02:25,691
and emphasize that. That's the key.

1113
01:02:27,093 --> 01:02:28,861
And for things like cosmetics,

1114
01:02:28,861 --> 01:02:30,630
it's way more natural if you actually
try them yourself first, right?

1115
01:02:30,630 --> 01:02:31,664
Of course.

1116
01:02:31,664 --> 01:02:34,100
You can just mention
stuff like brightening or anti-aging,

1117
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:36,936
but you only know how it goes on
or how long it lasts by using it.

1118
01:02:36,936 --> 01:02:38,337
Exactly.

1119
01:02:38,337 --> 01:02:39,538
Before a show,

1120
01:02:39,538 --> 01:02:41,841
I use everything myself
for days beforehand.

1121
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:43,409
I even keep testing notes.

1122
01:02:43,676 --> 01:02:46,746
What matters most is turning everything
into your own words.

1123
01:02:47,647 --> 01:02:49,315
- Testing notes.
- Yeah.

1124
01:02:53,286 --> 01:02:54,086
Here they are.

1125
01:02:54,820 --> 01:02:55,655
This is it.

1126
01:02:55,655 --> 01:02:57,223
- You really wrote the key points.
- Yeah.

1127
01:02:59,926 --> 01:03:01,894
Scoop up a spoonful like this.

1128
01:03:01,894 --> 01:03:02,828
Scoop up a spoonful.

1129
01:03:02,828 --> 01:03:04,597
Then talk while you let it cool.

1130
01:03:05,698 --> 01:03:09,735
Everyone, see the steam rising?
This is when it tastes the best, right?

1131
01:03:10,269 --> 01:03:13,539
Everyone, see the steam rising?
This is when it tastes the best, right?

1132
01:03:13,940 --> 01:03:15,441
I'll try this.

1133
01:03:15,975 --> 01:03:17,643
I'll try this.

1134
01:03:21,781 --> 01:03:22,715
This is it.

1135
01:03:27,286 --> 01:03:28,487
This is it.

1136
01:03:28,487 --> 01:03:30,656
Yeah, there you go.
Let's try again.

1137
01:03:31,457 --> 01:03:33,426
You've all had this happen, right?

1138
01:03:33,426 --> 01:03:35,962
In the morning,
you pack soup in a lunchbox,

1139
01:03:35,962 --> 01:03:37,530
and it leaks all over your bag.

1140
01:03:37,530 --> 01:03:39,732
That's such a disaster.
Even your clothes...

1141
01:03:39,732 --> 01:03:41,601
In parts like that
where you're emphasizing something,

1142
01:03:41,601 --> 01:03:44,670
it's good if we make eye contact
and give each other a little smile.

1143
01:03:44,670 --> 01:03:47,940
If you only stare at the camera,
it feels like you're off on your own.

1144
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:49,575
Right. Reactions.

1145
01:03:50,009 --> 01:03:53,012
It'd be nice if you could cue
when we should pause and react.

1146
01:03:53,012 --> 01:03:54,246
Okay.

1147
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:57,350
So the timing of the pauses is important.

1148
01:03:57,350 --> 01:03:58,651
Yeah.

1149
01:04:10,796 --> 01:04:11,631
Good luck.

1150
01:04:15,901 --> 01:04:18,571
Three, two, one.

1151
01:04:19,672 --> 01:04:22,041
Hello, everyone.
I'm show host Hong Seon Young.

1152
01:04:22,041 --> 01:04:23,876
Hello, I'm Yang Mi Sook.

1153
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:27,747
Everyone, what do you worry about
when you use food containers?

1154
01:04:27,747 --> 01:04:30,683
After just a short time,
they get stained and pick up smells.

1155
01:04:30,683 --> 01:04:33,552
You're nervous
they might be leaching harmful chemicals.

1156
01:04:33,552 --> 01:04:36,722
You wonder if they're okay in the freezer
or safe in the microwave.

1157
01:04:36,722 --> 01:04:38,291
Isn't that right?

1158
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:41,427
Right. Once you buy them, you want
to use them cleanly for a long time.

1159
01:04:41,427 --> 01:04:43,229
But there's just so much to worry about.

1160
01:04:44,096 --> 01:04:47,099
What brand pops into your head
at times like that?

1161
01:04:47,099 --> 01:04:48,567
Yes, Gotlock.

1162
01:04:48,567 --> 01:04:51,470
It's held the number one spot
in brand power for ten years straight,

1163
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:53,506
and earned the notoriously strict
LOHAS certification...

1164
01:04:53,506 --> 01:04:55,541
eight years in a row.

1165
01:04:55,541 --> 01:04:59,445
It's the brand moms trust
and reach for first.

1166
01:04:59,445 --> 01:05:02,748
Honestly, every home has
at least one piece of Gotlock, right?

1167
01:05:02,748 --> 01:05:03,583
Exactly.

1168
01:05:03,583 --> 01:05:05,518
This time I switched out
all the containers at home...

1169
01:05:05,518 --> 01:05:07,286
and replaced them with Gotlock.

1170
01:05:07,286 --> 01:05:09,989
Before, no matter how much
I cleaned the fridge,

1171
01:05:09,989 --> 01:05:13,326
it still felt cluttered,
and faint side-dish smells kept lingering.

1172
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:15,394
Now it's completely spotless.

1173
01:05:15,394 --> 01:05:18,431
Now I really get why homemakers
keep looking for Gotlock.

1174
01:05:18,431 --> 01:05:20,266
- I get it now.
- Right.

1175
01:05:20,266 --> 01:05:23,936
There's a reason
so many homemakers trust and choose it.

1176
01:05:23,936 --> 01:05:26,906
Now, with just about a minute left
in our show,

1177
01:05:26,906 --> 01:05:28,808
our remaining stock is almost...

1178
01:05:29,709 --> 01:05:30,876
Yes, completely sold out!

1179
01:05:30,876 --> 01:05:31,744
We did it.

1180
01:05:33,112 --> 01:05:35,314
Everyone, thank you so much.

1181
01:05:35,314 --> 01:05:38,884
Our smart shoppers
really do know how to decide fast.

1182
01:05:39,852 --> 01:05:43,022
To everyone who joined us today,
thank you from the bottom of our hearts.

1183
01:05:43,022 --> 01:05:44,590
Changing what goes on your family's table.

1184
01:05:44,590 --> 01:05:47,159
It's not too late to start today.

1185
01:05:47,159 --> 01:05:50,062
If you missed today's order,
please look forward to our next show.

1186
01:05:50,062 --> 01:05:52,331
Here's to always staying healthy
and running a thrifty home.

1187
01:05:52,331 --> 01:05:53,833
We'll be cheering you on.

1188
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:56,869
Thank you so much, everyone.

1189
01:05:59,839 --> 01:06:00,906
Great work, everyone.

1190
01:06:10,483 --> 01:06:11,517
Are you heading home already?

1191
01:06:11,984 --> 01:06:14,086
Hey, you worked hard today.

1192
01:06:15,388 --> 01:06:17,490
Do you have to get home early today
or something?

1193
01:06:17,490 --> 01:06:19,125
No, not really.

1194
01:06:19,425 --> 01:06:22,194
We're grabbing a drink with the others
at Million Hof tonight.

1195
01:06:22,194 --> 01:06:23,296
Do you want to come?

1196
01:06:23,296 --> 01:06:25,097
I'm buying.

1197
01:06:25,798 --> 01:06:26,866
Really?

1198
01:06:27,233 --> 01:06:28,367
If you're buying, I should go.

1199
01:06:29,435 --> 01:06:30,202
Let's go.

1200
01:06:36,042 --> 01:06:38,778
Thanks for everything.

1201
01:06:38,778 --> 01:06:39,845
It's nothing.

1202
01:06:40,980 --> 01:06:42,281
I told you, right?

1203
01:06:42,281 --> 01:06:43,883
I'm getting your help for now.

1204
01:06:43,883 --> 01:06:46,152
But don't think
I'll be cutting you slack forever.

1205
01:06:46,953 --> 01:06:49,355
My school might not be as good as yours,

1206
01:06:49,355 --> 01:06:50,923
but I have more grit than you do.

1207
01:06:50,923 --> 01:06:52,592
Yang Mi Sook.

1208
01:06:52,592 --> 01:06:54,427
You really do have pride.

1209
01:06:55,127 --> 01:06:56,395
Hold on.

1210
01:06:59,432 --> 01:07:00,333
(Nanny)

1211
01:07:11,644 --> 01:07:12,612
I'm sorry.

1212
01:07:12,778 --> 01:07:13,579
It's okay.

1213
01:07:33,766 --> 01:07:35,468
Why isn't she picking up?

1214
01:08:32,692 --> 01:08:34,827
(Don't call me ma'am)

1215
01:08:35,294 --> 01:08:36,862
Why isn't she picking up?

1216
01:08:36,862 --> 01:08:37,797
Min Woo.

1217
01:08:37,797 --> 01:08:38,831
Noh Min Jun.

1218
01:08:40,132 --> 01:08:41,968
We're getting a divorce.

1219
01:08:41,968 --> 01:08:43,436
Tell me why.

1220
01:08:44,737 --> 01:08:46,739
Do I look okay today?

1221
01:08:47,506 --> 01:08:48,341
Gu Joo Young.

1222
01:08:48,341 --> 01:08:51,877
You know how there are guys
who have that uniquely nice smell?

1223
01:08:56,115 --> 01:08:58,517
Am I some nanny
who gets a paycheck from you?

1224
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:00,786
Is Mom your maid who cleans up after you?

1225
01:09:00,786 --> 01:09:01,754
I should just shut
that smart mouth of yours.

1226
01:09:01,754 --> 01:09:04,457
Go on, do it.
If you think you can, hit me.

1227
01:09:04,457 --> 01:09:06,492
So you're going back?

1228
01:09:07,193 --> 01:09:08,995
Use this chance
to step back from childcare.

1229
01:09:11,931 --> 01:09:13,933
