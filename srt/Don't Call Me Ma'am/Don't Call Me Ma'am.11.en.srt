00:00:33,117 --> 00:00:36,621
Another ugly truth that shocked us all...

5
00:00:36,621 --> 00:00:39,690
came to light.

00:00:41,926 --> 00:00:44,495
Cho Na Jeong, did you hear?

7
00:00:44,495 --> 00:00:45,696
Hear what?

8
00:00:46,264 --> 00:00:47,965
They say the police took away...

9
00:00:48,466 --> 00:00:49,800
Kim Jeong Sik and Mr. Kang.

10
00:00:50,635 --> 00:00:52,103
Why? What happened?

11
00:00:53,671 --> 00:00:56,707
Mr. Kang got into a car accident
while drunk.

12
00:00:57,008 --> 00:00:58,009
Hey, Cho Na Jeong.

13
00:00:58,542 --> 00:00:59,777
What do you think you're doing right now?

14
00:00:59,777 --> 00:01:01,078
Are you out of your mind?

15
00:01:01,078 --> 00:01:03,447
I should be asking you, Mr. Kim.

16
00:01:03,447 --> 00:01:04,548
What are you saying?

17
00:01:05,383 --> 00:01:07,752
A boss can't have a drink
with his employee?

18
00:01:08,219 --> 00:01:09,320
We can't even share a taxi?

19
00:01:11,022 --> 00:01:11,889
Mr. Kang!

20
00:01:13,758 --> 00:01:17,028
The police pulled the dashcam footage
while investigating the accident,

21
00:01:17,595 --> 00:01:18,529
and on there,

22
00:01:20,932 --> 00:01:22,333
they found the two of them...

23
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:24,835
sexually assaulting Seon Min.

24

25
00:01:37,481 --> 00:01:40,952
While drinking together
with Kang Jong Ryeol,

26
00:01:42,253 --> 00:01:44,288
you got a call from the victim,

27
00:01:44,488 --> 00:01:46,357
then you told her to come out for a drink,

28
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:52,396
and when she got drunk,
you two put her in a car and...

29
00:01:53,731 --> 00:01:54,599
Goodness.

30
00:01:56,567 --> 00:01:59,036
You guys don't have a shred of conscience.

31
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:03,441
How could you do that...

32
00:02:03,441 --> 00:02:04,976
to someone who came to you
begging for help?

Can you hear me?

36
00:02:33,137 --> 00:02:34,138
Just a moment.

37
00:02:35,806 --> 00:02:37,341
- Nurse.
- Yes?

38
00:02:37,341 --> 00:02:39,343
The patient's awake.
Please call the doctor.

39
00:02:39,343 --> 00:02:41,445
The doctor is currently
with another patient.

40
00:02:41,445 --> 00:02:43,147
- Ma'am.
- Okay.

41
00:02:43,648 --> 00:02:45,116
- Executive Director.
- You shouldn't leave, ma'am.

42
00:02:45,116 --> 00:02:46,284

43
00:02:46,284 --> 00:02:47,318

44
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:06,671
What happened?

45
00:03:08,139 --> 00:03:09,140
Explain it to me.

46
00:03:10,775 --> 00:03:13,444
Is what the police said true?

47
00:03:14,745 --> 00:03:15,846
Damn it.

48
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:17,748
Is it true?

49
00:03:21,218 --> 00:03:22,620
Are you even human?

50
00:03:24,255 --> 00:03:26,157
How could you do something like that?

51
00:03:27,758 --> 00:03:29,293
Now, you're even turning Ye Eun...

52
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:31,395
into a rapist's daughter?

53
00:03:33,731 --> 00:03:34,599
Yes.

54
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,302
I've known you were trash for a long time.

55
00:03:38,803 --> 00:03:40,638
I just pretended not to know
because of Ye Eun.

56
00:03:40,638 --> 00:03:42,607
You've always disgusted me.

57
00:03:43,374 --> 00:03:45,209
I'm finally paying the price.

58
00:03:47,111 --> 00:03:50,881
My sin was choosing you
in the first place.

59
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:53,351
What exactly did you do so right?

60
00:03:53,351 --> 00:03:54,385
Are you saying...

61
00:03:55,286 --> 00:03:56,988
this is none of your fault at all?

62
00:03:57,622 --> 00:04:00,591
Be honest. You married me
for my background, didn't you?

63
00:04:01,259 --> 00:04:03,261
Because I'm the chairman's wife's nephew.

64
00:04:03,261 --> 00:04:04,895
That's why you came after me.

65
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:08,799
You married me after doing all the math.

66
00:04:10,935 --> 00:04:13,771
That's why even when I was eyeing
other women,

67
00:04:13,771 --> 00:04:15,373
you never once showed a hint of jealousy.

68
00:04:16,274 --> 00:04:18,943
So why are you putting everything on me?

69
00:04:23,247 --> 00:04:25,716
Have you ever, even once,

70
00:04:25,716 --> 00:04:27,885
treated me like your husband?

71
00:04:28,753 --> 00:04:30,588
Every chance you got,
you called me an idiot.

72
00:04:30,588 --> 00:04:32,256
Every chance you got,
you called me a blockhead.

73
00:04:32,823 --> 00:04:35,726
So why is everything my fault?

74
00:04:35,726 --> 00:04:37,561
Why is all of this suddenly on me?

75
00:04:38,796 --> 00:04:40,598
- Damn it.
- Stop it.

76
00:04:40,598 --> 00:04:41,966
Let go of me.

77
00:04:41,966 --> 00:04:44,335
I wasn't like this from the start?

78
00:04:44,335 --> 00:04:45,569
Hey, let go of me.

79
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,838
Do you have any idea
how much I cared about you?

80
00:04:48,973 --> 00:04:50,207
Let go!

81
00:04:58,683 --> 00:05:01,052
The more I think about it,
nothing about him was normal.

82
00:05:01,052 --> 00:05:02,987
- Even his looks gave me a bad feeling.
- Right?

83
00:05:02,987 --> 00:05:04,522
If you think about it...

84
00:05:04,522 --> 00:05:07,024
How can someone...

85
00:05:07,024 --> 00:05:09,193
do something like that?

86
00:05:09,193 --> 00:05:11,095
To think a rapist was right next to me.

87
00:05:11,095 --> 00:05:12,296
It gives me chills.

88
00:05:12,296 --> 00:05:15,032
Now that I think about it,

89
00:05:15,032 --> 00:05:18,169
he always ran his eyes over the show hosts
like a snake, top to bottom,

90
00:05:18,169 --> 00:05:19,604
and it always felt gross.

91
00:05:20,471 --> 00:05:21,872
He always seemed a bit off, didn't he?

92
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:25,876
I thought he was just acting sleazily,

93
00:05:26,644 --> 00:05:27,778
but I never imagined it was this bad.

94
00:05:27,778 --> 00:05:30,715
If Producer Noh hadn't spoken up,

95
00:05:30,715 --> 00:05:33,250
there might've been more victims.
That's the scariest part.

96
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:38,022
I never even imagined
something like this had happened,

97
00:05:38,789 --> 00:05:39,957
so I'm completely shaken too.

98
00:05:42,827 --> 00:05:43,694
Excuse me.

99
00:05:45,463 --> 00:05:46,430
Yes, honey?

100
00:05:48,466 --> 00:05:49,267
Really?

101
00:05:51,469 --> 00:05:52,370
Honey.

102
00:05:54,038 --> 00:05:54,872
Hey.

103
00:05:56,307 --> 00:05:57,108
Let's go in.

104
00:06:20,164 --> 00:06:22,800
Thank you, Ms. Cho.

105
00:06:24,068 --> 00:06:26,404
Ever since I heard from Producer Noh...

106
00:06:28,406 --> 00:06:30,942
I really wanted to meet you.

107
00:06:31,742 --> 00:06:32,643
You could've...

108
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:37,848
just looked the other way, but you didn't.

109
00:06:38,616 --> 00:06:39,483
Thank you...

110
00:06:41,385 --> 00:06:42,653
so much.

111
00:06:43,921 --> 00:06:44,789
No, not at all.

112
00:06:46,023 --> 00:06:46,991
To be honest,

113
00:06:48,192 --> 00:06:50,061
I hesitated at first too.

114
00:06:51,262 --> 00:06:53,464
I didn't realize how serious it was.

115
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:57,368
You must have gone through so much alone.

116
00:06:58,769 --> 00:06:59,704
Still,

117
00:07:00,137 --> 00:07:02,139
I'm so relieved
you woke up safe like this.

118
00:07:03,407 --> 00:07:05,142
I was foolish.

119
00:07:07,945 --> 00:07:08,980
Back then,

120
00:07:11,215 --> 00:07:12,850
I was so desperate...

121
00:07:13,451 --> 00:07:17,054
that I went to him,
trying somehow to make things right.

122
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:19,757
None of this is your fault, Seon Min.

123
00:07:20,391 --> 00:07:21,926
Don't ever think it is.

124
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:23,995
The real way you get back at those men...

125
00:07:25,463 --> 00:07:27,832
is by living confidently, with your head held high.

126
00:07:35,373 --> 00:07:36,240

128
00:07:57,929 --> 00:07:58,996
Why?

129
00:07:58,996 --> 00:08:00,631
Am I so pretty?

130
00:08:00,631 --> 00:08:02,433
Yeah, so pretty I could die.

131
00:08:02,433 --> 00:08:03,301
Good grief.

132
00:08:06,137 --> 00:08:06,938
Thank you...

133
00:08:07,705 --> 00:08:09,206
for staying grounded
and handling everything...

134
00:08:09,206 --> 00:08:10,808
when I was indecisive.

135
00:08:12,009 --> 00:08:13,544
What do you mean, you're indecisive?

136
00:08:14,412 --> 00:08:16,147
You just went through more than most...

137
00:08:16,147 --> 00:08:17,848
because you still have a conscience.

138
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:21,953

You've been staying at Il Ri's
for a while now, right?

but I kept dragging my feet.

I'll pack up and leave today,
so you can move right back in.

No.

163

There's no need to rush.

164
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:55,046
No, I'll clear out right away,
so just come home.

165
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,448
We'll talk again.

166
00:09:59,016 --> 00:10:00,785

for some application,

176
00:10:29,347 --> 00:10:32,516
only six people would be applying
or something like that.

177

So...

178
00:10:34,318 --> 00:10:36,821

thinking maybe one of us...

00:10:36,821 --> 00:10:37,822
is going to get fired.

00:11:01,579 --> 00:11:03,247
(Hello, Intern Cho Na Jeong.)

185
00:11:06,484 --> 00:11:08,185
(Your collaborative conduct has been
repeatedly reported as problematic.)

186
00:11:08,185 --> 00:11:09,987
(It was determined that your fit with
our corporate culture is below standard.)

187
00:11:09,987 --> 00:11:11,656
(We regret to inform you that an early
termination has been implemented.)

188
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:18,562
(We sincerely thank you
for your participation in the program,)

189
00:11:18,562 --> 00:11:21,899
(and we wish you all the best
in your future career path.)

190
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:32,843
How can they do this?

191
00:11:32,843 --> 00:11:34,545
Even if you're an intern,
firing you overnight?

192
00:11:34,912 --> 00:11:36,547
This is 100 percent
because of Kim Jeong Sik, right?

193
00:11:36,948 --> 00:11:39,550
They can't touch your full-time husband
or Song Ye Na,

194
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,285
so they're taking it out on you
because you're an easy target.

195
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,522
So what now?

196
00:11:44,522 --> 00:11:46,223
Are you really just going
to let them do this to you?

197
00:11:48,693 --> 00:11:49,660
Honey.

198
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,365
I'll head in first.

199
00:11:54,765 --> 00:11:55,833
You two go ahead and talk.

200
00:12:00,972 --> 00:12:03,608
What happened?
They're ending your internship?

201
00:12:03,608 --> 00:12:04,475
Yeah.

202
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:07,445
I'm really sorry.

203
00:12:08,346 --> 00:12:09,313
This is on me.

204
00:12:09,847 --> 00:12:11,682
Since those bastards can't take it out on me,

205
00:12:11,682 --> 00:12:12,984
they're taking it out on you.

206
00:12:16,988 --> 00:12:18,389
This isn't right.

207
00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:20,057
I should at least go to HR
and file a complaint.

208
00:12:20,057 --> 00:12:20,825
Don't do it.

209
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:23,761
What if you end up getting fired too?

210
00:12:24,295 --> 00:12:25,563
And we have kids to raise.

211
00:12:25,563 --> 00:12:27,331
At least one of us must stay
at the company.

212
00:12:27,331 --> 00:12:28,399
In a way, it's a relief.

213
00:12:28,966 --> 00:12:30,968
When I told you to go
to the Ethics Committee,

214
00:12:31,636 --> 00:12:33,337
did you think I wasn't ready for this?

215
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:35,006
So what now?

216
00:12:35,973 --> 00:12:37,408
You're just going to sit back like this?

217
00:12:37,942 --> 00:12:39,410
After being treated this unfairly?

218
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:40,244
No.

219
00:12:40,911 --> 00:12:42,013
I'm not just going to sit back.

220
00:12:42,813 --> 00:12:45,683
I'm going to push back
and do whatever I can.

221
00:12:46,684 --> 00:12:48,352
(HR Team)

222
00:12:49,587 --> 00:12:51,088
What exactly is the reason?

223
00:12:51,088 --> 00:12:52,657
There's still time left on my internship,

224
00:12:52,657 --> 00:12:54,959
so why am I the only one being cut early?

225
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,427
I'm really sorry,

226
00:12:56,794 --> 00:12:59,230
but we just followed company policy, okay?

227
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:01,299
In the email, it said
"problematic collaborative conduct,"

228
00:13:01,299 --> 00:13:03,267
and "below-standard fit
with the corporate culture."

229
00:13:03,267 --> 00:13:05,703
My attendance has been fine,

230
00:13:05,703 --> 00:13:08,773
and the shows I worked on
all had great sales.

231
00:13:08,773 --> 00:13:11,809
Can you really end an internship early
for vague reasons like that?

232
00:13:12,877 --> 00:13:15,413
Honestly, I don't know the specifics either.

233
00:13:15,413 --> 00:13:16,948
So if you really want details,

234
00:13:16,948 --> 00:13:18,716
you should ask the in-house legal team instead.

235
00:13:19,517 --> 00:13:22,787
- Sir.
- Legal team.

236
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:27,491
Yes, okay.

237
00:13:30,795 --> 00:13:32,496
Were you able to reach him?

238
00:13:33,531 --> 00:13:34,665
I got through,

239
00:13:34,665 --> 00:13:36,834
but the executive director is out all day
on business and won't be coming in.

240
00:13:38,002 --> 00:13:39,737
You might want to come back another day.

241
00:13:41,706 --> 00:13:43,574
Then, I'm sorry,

242
00:13:43,574 --> 00:13:46,444
but could you please tell him
I'd like to request a meeting?

243
00:13:48,613 --> 00:13:49,513
Okay.

244
00:13:49,914 --> 00:13:50,848
Thank you.

245
00:13:55,119 --> 00:13:55,987
Hey.

246
00:13:56,353 --> 00:13:59,322
Still, Sang Min's not a total lost cause.

247
00:13:59,323 --> 00:14:01,158
He handed you
that expensive house just like that.

248
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:05,129
He may be a pervert,
but he's a pervert with a conscience.

249
00:14:06,664 --> 00:14:08,566
I don't know if I did the right thing.

250
00:14:08,566 --> 00:14:11,369
No matter what,
he owns most of the shares of the house.

251
00:14:11,369 --> 00:14:14,238
Hey, at times like this,
you just shut your eyes and take it.

252
00:14:14,238 --> 00:14:16,407
When will you ever make enough
to buy a place like that?

253
00:14:18,476 --> 00:14:20,745
If I end up with nowhere to go,
I'll have to crash at your place.

254
00:14:20,745 --> 00:14:23,114
So stop overthinking it and take it.

255
00:14:23,114 --> 00:14:24,682
What are you talking about?

256
00:14:24,682 --> 00:14:26,550
You're about to get married.

257
00:14:26,984 --> 00:14:29,086
Right, and this.

258
00:14:29,086 --> 00:14:31,222
It's a little gift
for all the times I've mooched off you.

259
00:14:31,589 --> 00:14:33,724
What is all this?

260
00:14:36,594 --> 00:14:40,031
I liked yours so much
that I nearly used it all up.

261
00:14:40,031 --> 00:14:41,832
Thanks to that, don't you think
I've gotten a bit prettier?

262
00:14:42,934 --> 00:14:44,969
You're making me feel guilty.

263
00:14:47,939 --> 00:14:49,740
My friend.

264
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:52,777
Thanks to you,
my commute home never felt lonely.

265
00:14:54,278 --> 00:14:56,380
Now stop worrying about me,

266
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:59,817
and go be as lovey-dovey as you want
with Sang Gyu, okay?

267
00:15:02,053 --> 00:15:02,887
I'm off.

268
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:16,033
Hey.

269
00:15:18,135 --> 00:15:19,003
Sorry.

270
00:15:19,637 --> 00:15:22,506
I tried to hurry, but work ran late.

271
00:15:22,506 --> 00:15:23,341
No.

272
00:15:23,341 --> 00:15:25,343
I'm the one who just showed up
without calling.

273
00:15:26,277 --> 00:15:28,346
I'll send all the house paperwork
through the attorney,

274
00:15:28,346 --> 00:15:29,380
so don't worry about that.

275
00:15:32,984 --> 00:15:33,884
I'll get going.

276
00:15:39,557 --> 00:15:40,358
Sang Min.

277
00:15:42,994 --> 00:15:43,861
Why don't you...

278
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:47,098
have some ramyun before you go?

279
00:15:48,866 --> 00:15:49,700
What?

280
00:15:50,468 --> 00:15:51,269
Well,

281
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:56,240
I haven't eaten dinner,
so I'm a bit hungry.

282
00:15:57,408 --> 00:16:00,044
And you make really good ramyun.

283
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:02,513
You keep the noodles nice and firm.

284
00:16:14,425 --> 00:16:15,259
Eat up.

285
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,329
I made it firm, just the way you like it.

286
00:16:20,298 --> 00:16:21,565
As you probably saw earlier,

287
00:16:22,133 --> 00:16:23,935
if you want the noodles to stay firm,

288
00:16:23,935 --> 00:16:26,370
the key is to blanch them.

289
00:16:27,038 --> 00:16:29,507
If you parboil them lightly
and move them to the bowl,

290
00:16:29,507 --> 00:16:31,442
they cool down fast and get chewier.

291
00:16:32,777 --> 00:16:34,612
If you have bean sprouts, throw some in.

292
00:16:34,612 --> 00:16:37,248
A drop of fish sauce gives it a real kick.

293
00:16:37,648 --> 00:16:39,617
It's my secret recipe.

294
00:16:40,885 --> 00:16:43,154
Don't tell anyone.
You're the only one who gets to know.

295
00:16:44,255 --> 00:16:45,756
Let's eat. It'll get soggy.

296
00:16:59,003 --> 00:16:59,904
What?

297
00:17:01,339 --> 00:17:02,273
Why aren't you eating?

298
00:17:07,078 --> 00:17:08,813
The truth is, Sang Min,

299
00:17:10,081 --> 00:17:12,316
there's something I need to tell you.

300
00:17:14,719 --> 00:17:18,289
I heard from your mom...

301
00:17:20,057 --> 00:17:23,227
what Rebecca and Jessica mean to you.

302
00:17:26,664 --> 00:17:30,534
So I realized I had misunderstood things,

303
00:17:30,534 --> 00:17:32,603
and that I owe you an apology.

304
00:17:33,671 --> 00:17:36,574
I had no idea
you'd been through something like that.

305
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:39,010
Either way,
I'm sorry I said those things...

306
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:41,379
and judged you without knowing anything.

307
00:17:43,914 --> 00:17:46,417
When I first saw those dolls,
I was so shocked...

308
00:17:47,818 --> 00:17:49,587
that I didn't even try to understand...

309
00:17:50,221 --> 00:17:52,290
and just decided
you were some kind of freak.

310
00:17:53,157 --> 00:17:55,026
After that, I looked things up online...

311
00:17:55,826 --> 00:17:57,495
and even asked a doctor.

312
00:18:01,332 --> 00:18:02,445
Where are you going?

313
00:18:06,203 --> 00:18:07,104
What's wrong?

314
00:18:07,905 --> 00:18:09,273
Did I say something to upset you?

315
00:18:17,281 --> 00:18:19,917
Did you really have to go that far
to dig all that up?

316
00:18:21,218 --> 00:18:22,386
Why are you doing this to me?

317
00:18:22,954 --> 00:18:25,156
Now that it's all over,
why do you keep trying to figure me out?

318
00:18:25,156 --> 00:18:26,824
Because I want to know you better.

319
00:18:28,292 --> 00:18:30,995
But it felt like you were never
going to tell me yourself.

320
00:18:30,995 --> 00:18:32,029
I was frustrated.

321
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:34,398
You were the one person
I hoped wouldn't find out.

322
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,035
I'd rather you hate me.

323
00:18:38,669 --> 00:18:39,770
Don't pity me.

324
00:18:41,472 --> 00:18:43,374
Call me a crazy freak or a pervert.
Curse me out instead.

325
00:18:43,374 --> 00:18:45,509
Why did you have to make me feel this pathetic?

326
00:18:47,011 --> 00:18:48,646
Do you have any idea
how humiliating this is for me?

327
00:18:50,548 --> 00:18:51,816
What kind of a man...

328
00:18:53,017 --> 00:18:54,418
wants the woman he loves...

329
00:18:54,418 --> 00:18:57,054
to find out the pathetic
and stupid history of his?

330
00:19:29,487 --> 00:19:30,888
What's up with the deputy editor
these days?

331
00:19:31,489 --> 00:19:32,390
No clue.

332
00:19:53,744 --> 00:19:56,047
(Sang Gyu)

333
00:20:13,798 --> 00:20:15,466
Are you looking for anything
in particular, sir?

334
00:20:15,866 --> 00:20:17,234
Actually,

335
00:20:17,234 --> 00:20:21,138
I'm planning to propose to my girlfriend,

336
00:20:21,138 --> 00:20:22,640
but I don't really know what to get.

337
00:20:24,008 --> 00:20:26,844
I've been asking her for a while
to marry me,

338
00:20:26,844 --> 00:20:28,346
but she keeps dodging me.

339
00:20:28,346 --> 00:20:30,748
I want to really make it clear this time.

340
00:20:30,748 --> 00:20:31,983
Would something like this be okay?

341
00:20:32,183 --> 00:20:33,684
Definitely.

342
00:20:33,684 --> 00:20:34,619
In that case,

343
00:20:39,056 --> 00:20:40,291
how about something like this?

344
00:21:13,257 --> 00:21:14,859
Are you busy tonight?

345
00:21:20,731 --> 00:21:21,532
Why?

346
00:21:25,202 --> 00:21:26,737
Let's have dinner here.

347
00:21:27,571 --> 00:21:28,673
I heard this place is famous.

348
00:21:39,317 --> 00:21:40,217
Okay.

349
00:21:47,792 --> 00:21:48,659
Okay.

350
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:51,095
I'll make a reservation for seven.
See you then.

351
00:22:28,432 --> 00:22:30,201
You found this place
faster than I thought.

352
00:22:30,668 --> 00:22:33,371
It's tucked away in a corner,
so I thought it'd take you a while.

353
00:22:34,205 --> 00:22:36,040
I came here once
when I was covering a story.

354
00:22:36,407 --> 00:22:38,709
Right, you're a reporter.

355
00:22:38,709 --> 00:22:39,677
Reporter Lee Il Ri.

356
00:22:41,712 --> 00:22:43,414
You must be hungry.

357
00:22:43,414 --> 00:22:44,248
What do you want to eat?

358
00:22:45,116 --> 00:22:46,550
I'm not that hungry.

359
00:22:47,218 --> 00:22:49,854
Come on, at least pick at something.

360
00:22:49,854 --> 00:22:51,389
I searched this place on purpose.

361
00:22:54,191 --> 00:22:56,360
Just pasta, then.

362
00:22:57,895 --> 00:22:58,863
Steak.

363
00:22:58,863 --> 00:22:59,931
Let's get steak too.

364
00:23:00,965 --> 00:23:03,768
I want to treat you
to something good today.

365
00:23:04,669 --> 00:23:05,870
Okay? I'll order.

366
00:23:31,862 --> 00:23:32,997
This is really good.

367
00:23:34,198 --> 00:23:36,000
Nice vibe, right?

368
00:23:36,834 --> 00:23:40,371
This place is in the top five...

369
00:23:41,539 --> 00:23:44,508
for couples to relay their feelings...

370
00:23:44,508 --> 00:23:45,610
or propose and all that.

371
00:23:49,246 --> 00:23:51,616
Il Ri, the reason I asked you here...

372
00:23:54,418 --> 00:23:56,287
- is...
- I can't get married.

373
00:23:58,589 --> 00:23:59,590
I'm sorry,

374
00:24:01,292 --> 00:24:02,426
but we should end this.

375
00:24:06,864 --> 00:24:08,332
What are you talking about?

376
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,568
I should've said this way earlier.

377
00:24:11,802 --> 00:24:13,904
I'm not interested in getting married.

378
00:24:14,138 --> 00:24:15,273
I don't plan on getting married at all.

379
00:24:17,675 --> 00:24:18,342
Hey.

380
00:24:21,078 --> 00:24:21,912
Hey.

381
00:24:23,114 --> 00:24:24,882
What are you saying?

382
00:24:25,216 --> 00:24:26,684
Why are you suddenly planning
to stay single forever?

383
00:24:27,218 --> 00:24:29,220
I'm sorry.
I should've told you sooner.

384
00:24:29,954 --> 00:24:32,089
I was just having so much fun with you...

385
00:24:32,089 --> 00:24:33,424
that I couldn't bring myself to say it.

386
00:24:33,958 --> 00:24:34,892
Wait a minute.

387
00:24:37,762 --> 00:24:40,898
Il Ri, say it so I can understand.

388
00:24:41,565 --> 00:24:42,934
What do you mean
you don't plan to marry...

389
00:24:42,934 --> 00:24:44,869
and you're not interested
in getting married?

390
00:24:45,569 --> 00:24:46,871
What does that even mean?

391
00:24:46,871 --> 00:24:48,606
You and I are on
completely different pages.

392
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,243
Marriage just feels like
way too much for me.

393
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:55,780
You know I hate feeling tied down.

394
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:01,018
I'm sorry for blindsiding you like this.

395
00:25:07,224 --> 00:25:08,459
Anyway, take care.

396
00:25:09,594 --> 00:25:12,563
Even if we bump into each other in front
of the house, I hope we keep it casual.

397
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:14,131
Wait.

398
00:25:14,732 --> 00:25:15,466
Il Ri.

399
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,068
Il Ri.

400
00:25:28,312 --> 00:25:29,814
Lee Il Ri.

401
00:25:33,618 --> 00:25:35,886
You can't just walk away like this.

402
00:25:35,886 --> 00:25:37,355
What's the real reason?

403
00:25:39,123 --> 00:25:40,825
What is it you dislike so much?

404
00:25:42,193 --> 00:25:43,527
You said you liked me too.

405
00:25:44,295 --> 00:25:45,963
It wasn't just me liking you alone.

406
00:25:45,963 --> 00:25:49,300
You said you were jealous
and that you liked me too.

407
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,134
No.

408
00:25:50,668 --> 00:25:52,370
It's not that I liked you.

409
00:25:52,903 --> 00:25:54,639
I think I just liked that you liked me.

410
00:25:55,773 --> 00:25:57,642
I think I just missed
having someone who treated me well.

411
00:26:03,514 --> 00:26:04,348
Then,

412
00:26:05,616 --> 00:26:07,985
why did you end up not liking me?

413
00:26:09,153 --> 00:26:11,088
You were the one who said...

414
00:26:12,857 --> 00:26:13,991
I was the person you wanted to marry.

415
00:26:14,959 --> 00:26:17,028
So was all of that a lie until now?

416
00:26:17,028 --> 00:26:18,696
Do I really have to spell it out
for you to get it?

417
00:26:19,931 --> 00:26:21,933
Do you honestly think
you and I are a good match?

418
00:26:23,034 --> 00:26:25,069
To be honest,
I don't even like you that much.

419
00:26:25,803 --> 00:26:28,572
I only went out with you
because I needed a guy.

420
00:26:29,273 --> 00:26:30,775
As for marriage,

421
00:26:31,742 --> 00:26:33,144
I've never once
seriously thought about it.

422
00:26:34,745 --> 00:26:36,580
Why are you overreacting
and crossing the line?

423
00:26:37,615 --> 00:26:39,984
Please read the room
and stop clinging to me.

424
00:26:41,886 --> 00:26:43,387
It feels outrageous
and infuriating, right?

425
00:26:44,622 --> 00:26:46,924
But what can I do?
This is who I really am.

426
00:26:49,794 --> 00:26:51,963
So I think it's best if we stop here.

427
00:28:18,082 --> 00:28:19,817
All done.

428
00:28:22,186 --> 00:28:24,822
I can't believe I'm showing you
this mess after 20 years.

429
00:28:25,423 --> 00:28:27,592
Hey, what are you talking about?

430
00:28:27,592 --> 00:28:28,859
Back in college,

431
00:28:28,859 --> 00:28:30,528
I carried your drunk self all the time.

432
00:28:30,528 --> 00:28:32,496
I've already seen
all kinds of things from you.

433
00:28:35,499 --> 00:28:36,467
Bye, then.

434
00:28:38,736 --> 00:28:39,770
Hey.

435
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:41,739
If anything ever happens,

436
00:28:41,739 --> 00:28:43,741
call me right away, okay?

437
00:29:05,229 --> 00:29:07,164
(Sweet Home Shopping)

438
00:29:23,814 --> 00:29:24,749
What's this about?

439
00:29:24,749 --> 00:29:25,650
Hello.

440
00:29:26,083 --> 00:29:27,885
My name is Cho Na Jeong,
and I took part...

441
00:29:27,885 --> 00:29:29,020
in the Career-Interrupted Women
Internship Program.

442
00:29:29,453 --> 00:29:32,223
I went to the secretary's office
and requested a meeting as well,

443
00:29:32,223 --> 00:29:33,658
but I was turned down every time.

444
00:29:33,658 --> 00:29:34,992
I know this is presumptuous,

445
00:29:34,992 --> 00:29:37,328
but I had no other way to see you,
so I came like this.

446
00:29:37,328 --> 00:29:38,396
So,

447
00:29:38,396 --> 00:29:39,563
what is it you want to say?

448
00:29:40,831 --> 00:29:43,634
I was notified of early termination
of the internship.

449
00:29:43,935 --> 00:29:46,003
Right after I reported Division Head
Kim Jeong Sik to the Ethics Committee,

450
00:29:46,003 --> 00:29:48,039
this decision came down.

451
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:49,073
It doesn't feel like a coincidence.

452
00:29:50,074 --> 00:29:52,877
Wasn't this a retaliatory action...

453
00:29:52,877 --> 00:29:54,145
that completely ignored
my performance as an intern?

454
00:29:55,212 --> 00:29:57,782
You really are as bold as the rumors say.

455
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:00,484
Ms. Cho Na Jeong.

456
00:30:00,685 --> 00:30:04,155
What do you think a company is?

457
00:30:06,424 --> 00:30:09,193
A company exists to make money.

458
00:30:09,193 --> 00:30:11,329
It's not a place
to chase after goodness or justice.

459
00:30:11,929 --> 00:30:13,397
Why do we run an internship program?

460
00:30:13,397 --> 00:30:16,667
To see how well you fit
into our organization.

461
00:30:16,667 --> 00:30:19,437
For the company to see you, Ms. Cho,

462
00:30:19,437 --> 00:30:21,305
who causes this much commotion
even as an intern...

463
00:30:21,305 --> 00:30:23,808
as a risk who disrupts order
and undermines the system...

464
00:30:23,808 --> 00:30:25,042
is only natural.
Don't you agree?

465
00:30:25,343 --> 00:30:28,012
But the higher-ups also thought
it was doing the right thing...

466
00:30:28,012 --> 00:30:29,914
when it launched this internship program,
didn't they?

467
00:30:29,914 --> 00:30:30,881
Well,

468
00:30:31,182 --> 00:30:34,018
to be honest, I couldn't care less...

469
00:30:34,018 --> 00:30:35,253
about that kind of image.

470
00:30:35,653 --> 00:30:37,188
That was probably
Executive Director Seo's idea.

471
00:30:37,955 --> 00:30:40,591
Stop feeling wronged and go home.

472
00:30:41,125 --> 00:30:43,227
Dragging this out
will only wear you down, Ms. Cho.

473
00:30:43,227 --> 00:30:45,730
I'm saying this for your own good.

474
00:30:46,364 --> 00:30:47,665
Executive Director Seo...

475
00:30:47,665 --> 00:30:50,301
shouldn't have started
such a pointless project.

476
00:30:50,301 --> 00:30:52,036
All it does is give people headaches.

477
00:31:19,897 --> 00:31:22,767
So that means Ms. Cho is the only one
being dropped from the internship,

478
00:31:22,767 --> 00:31:23,734
right?

479
00:31:23,734 --> 00:31:26,270
To be honest,
ever since Ms. Cho started speaking up,

480
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:29,740
I've been on edge,
worried the fallout might hit us.

481
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:32,009
Why did she have to meddle
in someone else's business...

482
00:31:32,009 --> 00:31:33,644
and end up getting herself fired?

483
00:31:33,644 --> 00:31:35,579
If she'd just stayed quiet,
she would've stayed safely in the middle.

484
00:31:35,579 --> 00:31:37,949
Her husband was unfairly framed.

485
00:31:38,149 --> 00:31:39,450
That's what this is about, right?

486
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:42,553
I don't get her husband either.

487
00:31:42,553 --> 00:31:45,089
I mean,
what kind of amazing junior is she...

488
00:31:45,089 --> 00:31:47,124
that he's so desperate
to stick his neck out for her?

489
00:31:47,124 --> 00:31:49,560
And in the end,
he just ruined an innocent wife.

490
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:52,530
But thanks to that,
we got rid of one competitor.

491
00:31:53,531 --> 00:31:56,934
What kind of bullshit
is this supposed to be?

492
00:31:56,934 --> 00:31:57,969
Mi Sook.

493
00:32:01,339 --> 00:32:03,140
Ms. Cho, you were standing there?

494
00:32:03,841 --> 00:32:06,410
I was just worried about you, that's all.

495
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:08,613
How can you even say something like that?

496
00:32:09,146 --> 00:32:11,215
What? It was wrong to meddle
in someone else's business?

497
00:32:11,215 --> 00:32:13,351
Helping a junior was a stupid move?

498
00:32:14,852 --> 00:32:18,222
After all that hell she went through,
she got a rapist out of our way.

499
00:32:18,222 --> 00:32:19,924
So how can you say something like that?

500
00:32:20,258 --> 00:32:21,325
Why are you pointing fingers
not at the one who did wrong,

501
00:32:21,325 --> 00:32:23,594
but at the one who kept her conscience?

502
00:32:24,328 --> 00:32:25,763
Try putting yourself in Seon Min's shoes.

503
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:27,965
If that had happened to you,

504
00:32:27,965 --> 00:32:29,700
could you still say the same thing?

505
00:32:31,669 --> 00:32:33,337
Ms. Yang.

506
00:32:33,337 --> 00:32:35,306
Please don't get so worked up.

507
00:32:35,306 --> 00:32:37,375
How am I supposed not to get worked up
after hearing something like that?

508
00:32:38,542 --> 00:32:40,878
On top of it all,
you're glad you got rid of one competitor?

509
00:32:41,712 --> 00:32:43,080
I can't even.

510
00:32:43,547 --> 00:32:45,750
Back in the day, you went on
about drinks with colleagues and all that,

511
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:48,352
acting like you cared so much
about relationships.

512
00:32:48,352 --> 00:32:50,187
It must be nice being so shameless...

513
00:32:50,187 --> 00:32:52,823
you don't even get wrinkles.

514
00:32:53,224 --> 00:32:55,860
How can you grow older
and still think in such a dirty way?

515
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:57,628
Why do you live like that?

516
00:33:01,365 --> 00:33:02,199
Where are you going?

517
00:33:02,833 --> 00:33:04,068
Why are you walking away
in the middle of this?

518
00:33:07,204 --> 00:33:10,107
If you've got something to say,
say it to her face.

519
00:33:10,107 --> 00:33:11,642
Don't whisper behind people's backs.

520
00:33:11,642 --> 00:33:12,643
Got it?

521
00:33:13,844 --> 00:33:14,712
Mi Sook.

522
00:33:15,146 --> 00:33:16,480
Hey, Cho Na Jeong.

523
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,483
Where did all your old fire go?
Why just stand there listening to that?

524
00:33:19,483 --> 00:33:21,552
You should've gone for her hair
on the spot.

525
00:33:29,226 --> 00:33:30,962
I could've said all that myself too.

526
00:33:31,562 --> 00:33:32,763
Why did you jump in for nothing?

527
00:33:33,598 --> 00:33:35,433
What if your colleagues hate you now?

528
00:33:35,433 --> 00:33:36,801
Colleagues? No way.

529
00:33:37,335 --> 00:33:39,103
People who are happy
about knocking out a competitor?

530
00:33:39,103 --> 00:33:40,638
You can't call them colleagues.

531
00:33:40,638 --> 00:33:42,873
You should never let trash like that
stay in your life.

532
00:33:42,873 --> 00:33:44,575
You've got to cut them out completely.

533
00:33:46,644 --> 00:33:48,379
They're just desperate, that's all.

534
00:33:49,513 --> 00:33:50,748
They're career-interrupted women,
aren't they?

535
00:33:51,849 --> 00:33:54,218
This might be their last chance,

536
00:33:54,218 --> 00:33:55,753
so, of course, they can't see anything else.

537
00:33:56,254 --> 00:33:58,356
Even so,

538
00:33:58,356 --> 00:34:00,291
when people get older and live like that,

539
00:34:00,291 --> 00:34:01,659
it's just pathetic.

540
00:34:02,226 --> 00:34:06,063
You should never give up on loyalty.

541
00:34:06,063 --> 00:34:08,499
That's the only way you can grow old
with at least a little dignity.

542
00:34:09,634 --> 00:34:10,501
But, you.

543
00:34:11,936 --> 00:34:14,005
You were kind of cool back there.

544
00:34:14,438 --> 00:34:15,373
Girl crush.

545
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,074
Please.

546
00:34:17,875 --> 00:34:19,877
I've always been cool.

547
00:34:19,877 --> 00:34:21,712
Don't tell me you've fallen for me now.

548
00:34:27,051 --> 00:34:28,653
Anyway, thanks.

549
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:30,588
Go on in.

550
00:34:31,722 --> 00:34:33,291
Don't lose heart.

551
00:34:33,624 --> 00:34:35,426
If you ever need help, call me anytime.

552
00:34:36,394 --> 00:34:37,361
Good luck.

553
00:34:38,329 --> 00:34:39,096
Thanks.

554
00:34:40,331 --> 00:34:43,768
You've got to give it your all to the end
and make it.

555
00:34:44,201 --> 00:34:45,069
Okay?

556
00:34:46,037 --> 00:34:46,971
I'll call you.

557
00:34:47,705 --> 00:34:48,506
Bye, then.

558
00:34:57,448 --> 00:34:59,283
Noh Min Jun, over here.

559
00:34:59,283 --> 00:35:02,853
If you don't put lotion on your face,
it'll sting and hurt.

560
00:35:03,321 --> 00:35:04,855
- But, Mom.
- Yeah?

561
00:35:06,023 --> 00:35:07,358
Why aren't you going to work?

562
00:35:10,361 --> 00:35:14,031
I said I won't go to work...

563
00:35:14,031 --> 00:35:15,466
so I can stay with you two longer.

564
00:35:15,933 --> 00:35:18,603
It's really nice
playing with me all the time, right?

565
00:35:18,603 --> 00:35:19,570
Yeah.

566
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:20,538
No, it's not.

567
00:35:21,372 --> 00:35:24,008
My friends were really jealous...

568
00:35:24,008 --> 00:35:25,743
because you were on TV, Mom.

569
00:35:25,743 --> 00:35:28,479
Mom, go back on TV again.

570
00:35:32,183 --> 00:35:33,951
Come on, let's go now.

571
00:35:35,886 --> 00:35:37,154
You get some rest.

572
00:35:37,154 --> 00:35:40,124
I'll drop the kids off
and go to singing class, then come back.

573
00:35:40,658 --> 00:35:42,093
It's fine, Father.

574
00:35:42,093 --> 00:35:43,661
Please, you rest.

575
00:35:43,661 --> 00:35:45,429
Have a cup of coffee too, okay?

576
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:47,198
Let's go, guys.

577
00:36:18,462 --> 00:36:21,265
I heard you got fired.

578
00:36:22,833 --> 00:36:23,634
I did.

579
00:36:24,969 --> 00:36:26,871
I'm sorry. It's because of me.

580
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:30,374
It's okay.

581
00:36:31,175 --> 00:36:33,010
It's not like I didn't see it coming.

582
00:36:40,117 --> 00:36:41,285
You don't have to look at me like that.

583
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,121
I'm just reaping what I sowed.

584
00:36:45,289 --> 00:36:46,490
Now that I think about it,

585
00:36:47,458 --> 00:36:49,460
it was probably wrong
from the very beginning.

586
00:36:50,962 --> 00:36:53,030
Not long after we got married,

587
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:54,765
I saw who my husband really was.

588
00:36:56,601 --> 00:36:58,102
But I didn't want to admit it,

589
00:36:59,403 --> 00:37:00,404
and I didn't have the courage.

590
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:04,408
At first, the problems were small.

591
00:37:05,343 --> 00:37:06,677
But the more I closed my eyes to them,

592
00:37:07,144 --> 00:37:08,946
the more they snowballed.

593
00:37:09,714 --> 00:37:11,549
In the end, that self-deception...

594
00:37:12,316 --> 00:37:13,884
is what made everything blow up like this.

595
00:37:17,989 --> 00:37:20,658
I'm really sorry.

596
00:37:22,326 --> 00:37:24,729
In struggling so hard just to survive,

597
00:37:25,162 --> 00:37:26,931
I ended up making this happen to you.

598
00:37:27,698 --> 00:37:28,699
But...

599
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,569
I never truly hated you.

600
00:37:34,272 --> 00:37:35,706
When I said
that as long as you didn't cause trouble,

601
00:37:35,973 --> 00:37:39,377
you'd be the one
to get the final contract,

602
00:37:39,377 --> 00:37:40,511
I wasn't just saying it.

603
00:37:42,513 --> 00:37:45,316
I did hesitate because of Producer Noh,

604
00:37:46,284 --> 00:37:49,487
but I thought you were worth the risk,

605
00:37:51,522 --> 00:37:53,958
so I was about to make a bold decision.

606
00:38:10,041 --> 00:38:11,208
I'll fish another one.

607
00:38:19,917 --> 00:38:20,952
Yes!

608
00:39:31,455 --> 00:39:35,059
How can you not even dodge
something like this?

609
00:39:36,661 --> 00:39:40,364
Why can't you dodge something like this?

610
00:40:07,325 --> 00:40:08,492
Won Hye Jeong.

611
00:40:08,492 --> 00:40:10,628
Where on earth have you left your head?

612
00:40:13,264 --> 00:40:16,834
Didn't I tell you to be extra careful
on shoots when the client isn't coming?

613
00:40:16,834 --> 00:40:19,637
How did you end up scratching
something that expensive?

614
00:40:20,404 --> 00:40:23,307
It's just that the model is so skinny.

615
00:40:23,307 --> 00:40:25,376
While she was posing,

616
00:40:25,376 --> 00:40:27,078
she spread her arms way too wide, so...

617
00:40:27,078 --> 00:40:28,879
Did you warn the model or not?

618
00:40:29,647 --> 00:40:30,748
Hye Jeong.

619
00:40:31,282 --> 00:40:33,784
I know you're busy
because you're newly married,

620
00:40:33,784 --> 00:40:37,021
but you've got to keep
your head on straight during shoots.

621
00:40:37,021 --> 00:40:38,990
It's not like what we handle
is cheap stuff.

622
00:40:39,357 --> 00:40:40,791
Why are you acting like such a rookie?

623
00:40:45,863 --> 00:40:46,664
Hey.

624
00:40:47,865 --> 00:40:49,600
Why are you crying now,
over something like this?

625
00:40:51,869 --> 00:40:52,903
It's not that.

626
00:40:54,038 --> 00:40:57,141
I've just been really struggling lately.

627
00:40:59,143 --> 00:41:03,047
Before we got married,
he was crazy about me.

628
00:41:03,614 --> 00:41:05,650
It hasn't even been that long
since the wedding,

629
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:07,752
and he's done a complete 180.

630
00:41:08,486 --> 00:41:10,922
He gets annoyed with me
at the drop of a hat.

631
00:41:12,223 --> 00:41:14,125
The other day,
he didn't come home all night,

632
00:41:14,125 --> 00:41:16,227
and left me waiting until dawn.

633
00:41:16,227 --> 00:41:18,462
When I asked why he was so late,

634
00:41:18,462 --> 00:41:21,299
he told me to stop being so clingy.

635
00:41:22,066 --> 00:41:24,635
How can he talk to me like that?

636
00:41:25,202 --> 00:41:27,638
How can he already be sick of me?

637
00:41:28,105 --> 00:41:30,808
How does love change that easily?

638
00:41:32,176 --> 00:41:34,845
Ms. Lee, I think I made a mistake
getting married.

639
00:41:34,845 --> 00:41:35,846
What do I do?

640
00:41:36,814 --> 00:41:37,882
Ms. Lee.

641
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:40,484
Okay.

642
00:41:40,484 --> 00:41:42,453
I get what you're saying.

643
00:41:42,453 --> 00:41:44,322
Go outside and get some water.

644
00:41:44,922 --> 00:41:46,290
What about this?

645
00:41:46,958 --> 00:41:48,926
This costs over 4,000 dollars.

646
00:41:49,226 --> 00:41:50,595
I'll take care of it.

647
00:41:50,595 --> 00:41:52,530
You just call and apologize later.

648
00:41:53,064 --> 00:41:54,265
What am I going to do?

649
00:42:21,392 --> 00:42:22,693
Yes, Manager.

650
00:42:22,693 --> 00:42:23,861
You heard about it, right?

651
00:42:24,629 --> 00:42:25,596
I'm sorry.

652
00:42:26,464 --> 00:42:28,299
Yes, so we were thinking we'd somehow...

653
00:42:30,201 --> 00:42:31,035
Yes.

654
00:42:32,803 --> 00:42:33,671
Sorry?

655
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:39,644
What gives you the right
to tell us to fire our staff?

656
00:42:41,646 --> 00:42:43,948
I'll just buy the ring, then.

657
00:42:56,327 --> 00:42:57,395
Yes.

658
00:42:58,529 --> 00:42:59,597
You're baffled too, right?

659
00:43:00,765 --> 00:43:04,702
I told you to try to rein in that temper.

660
00:43:05,469 --> 00:43:07,738
But Manager Kim talks
way too carelessly...

661
00:43:07,738 --> 00:43:10,775
saying we should fire Won Hye Jeong,
make her kneel, and all that.

662
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:13,744
Exactly.

663
00:43:13,744 --> 00:43:15,446
It's one thing for me to come down hard
on my own staff,

664
00:43:15,446 --> 00:43:17,548
and another thing entirely
when someone else does it.

665
00:43:18,316 --> 00:43:19,183
You did well.

666
00:43:20,151 --> 00:43:23,187
Thanks to you,
they seem to have totally fallen for you.

667
00:43:23,187 --> 00:43:25,489
They were all saying their deputy editor
is seriously charismatic.

668
00:43:28,025 --> 00:43:30,995
Think of it as using this chance to
get yourself a piece of wedding jewelry.

669
00:43:31,462 --> 00:43:32,363
Il Ri,

670
00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:35,199
you're not going to get married anyway,
are you?

671
00:43:35,199 --> 00:43:38,703
So when else in your life are you ever
going to wear a ring like that?

672
00:43:40,137 --> 00:43:40,871
Here.

673
00:43:42,707 --> 00:43:45,042
I checked off the decent ones
on the intern list you gave me.

674
00:43:45,042 --> 00:43:46,077
Take a look.

675
00:43:46,077 --> 00:43:46,844
I'm off.

676
00:44:05,029 --> 00:44:06,797
What is she even talking about?

677
00:44:08,232 --> 00:44:10,067
"Wedding jewelry for me?"

678
00:44:11,335 --> 00:44:14,472
"When else will you ever
wear a ring like this?"

679
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:19,844
How can she say stuff like that,
like it's nothing?

680
00:45:03,254 --> 00:45:04,288
Damn it.

681
00:45:05,089 --> 00:45:06,757
(Na Jeong's husband)

682
00:45:33,217 --> 00:45:34,185
No.

683
00:45:34,185 --> 00:45:35,553
What do I do?

684
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:47,331
What do I do?

685
00:45:48,232 --> 00:45:49,200
Is it dead?

686
00:45:50,468 --> 00:45:51,469
It must be, right?

687
00:45:53,738 --> 00:45:56,173
Why is it so huge?

688
00:45:57,008 --> 00:45:58,409
Seriously.

689
00:46:08,152 --> 00:46:09,787
These are the healing experience tickets
and hotel vouchers...

690
00:46:09,787 --> 00:46:12,523
our company recently sold.

691
00:46:13,925 --> 00:46:14,859
Actually,

692
00:46:15,226 --> 00:46:17,495
my wife has seemed really worn out
since she quit her job.

693
00:46:18,162 --> 00:46:20,398
I thought that if she went on a trip
with her friends,

694
00:46:20,398 --> 00:46:21,666
it might help her reset.

695
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:25,002
Is this asking too much?

696
00:46:29,106 --> 00:46:32,410
Mr. Noh, you're so sweet.

697
00:46:33,678 --> 00:46:34,845
But I...

698
00:46:34,845 --> 00:46:36,981
No. I needed a healing experience too.

699
00:46:38,115 --> 00:46:39,450
I was just thinking
about taking a day off...

700
00:46:39,450 --> 00:46:41,953
and going somewhere to clear my head,

701
00:46:41,953 --> 00:46:42,920
so this worked out well.

702
00:46:43,554 --> 00:46:44,789
Hey, Gu Joo Young.

703
00:46:44,789 --> 00:46:46,991
You should take a day off too
and come with us.

704
00:46:47,558 --> 00:46:49,493
We seriously need
a healing experience, don't we?

705
00:46:55,366 --> 00:46:56,200
Sounds great.

706
00:46:57,368 --> 00:46:59,837
Mr. Noh, thank you so much.

707
00:47:00,404 --> 00:47:02,206
I've been starving for a trip too.

708
00:47:05,943 --> 00:47:08,512
A trip? In a situation like this?

709
00:47:08,512 --> 00:47:09,447
Guys.

710
00:47:09,447 --> 00:47:12,016
It's fine. I'm really okay.

711
00:47:12,016 --> 00:47:15,219
I'm thrilled to have more relaxed time
with the kids.

712
00:47:15,219 --> 00:47:16,921
Why are you acting like this?

713
00:47:16,921 --> 00:47:17,888
Okay, enough.

714
00:47:18,089 --> 00:47:20,224
Don't say anything,
and go get some real rest.

715
00:47:20,224 --> 00:47:21,826
Dad and I will take good care of the kids.

716
00:47:21,826 --> 00:47:23,094
Seriously?

717
00:47:23,094 --> 00:47:23,928
Right.

718
00:47:27,965 --> 00:47:29,400
I'll put this in your bag.

719
00:47:30,368 --> 00:47:32,403
You're going to eat lots of delicious food
with your friends,

720
00:47:32,403 --> 00:47:33,371
so you'll need this to keep in shape.

721
00:47:34,705 --> 00:47:37,008
It's fine. Wait.

722
00:47:37,008 --> 00:47:38,309
Okay, I get it.
Stop, just a second.

723
00:47:38,309 --> 00:47:39,877
Did you pack your sunglasses?

724
00:47:39,877 --> 00:47:40,978
Yeah, I did.

725
00:47:40,978 --> 00:47:42,513
- Phone?
- Back pocket.

726
00:47:42,513 --> 00:47:44,048
- Wallet?
- In my bag.

727
00:47:44,048 --> 00:47:45,082
Still.

728
00:47:45,082 --> 00:47:46,350
Thanks. Let's go.

729
00:47:46,851 --> 00:47:47,752
Guys.

730
00:47:47,752 --> 00:47:50,454
I told you I don't want to go on a trip.

731
00:47:54,258 --> 00:47:59,063
(Wando, Island of Health)

732
00:48:06,938 --> 00:48:07,972
What's with her?

733
00:48:08,239 --> 00:48:10,408
Is that really the same girl
who was grumbling about not wanting to go?

734
00:48:10,408 --> 00:48:12,877
Why do you think
we like Cho Na Jeong so much?

735
00:48:13,210 --> 00:48:14,712
She's so simple.

736
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:34,298
(Marine Healing Center)

737
00:48:40,805 --> 00:48:43,240
How did my husband even know
about a place like this?

738
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:44,342
He's so sweet.

739
00:48:45,843 --> 00:48:47,244
Hey, let's unload our stuff first.

740
00:48:47,244 --> 00:48:48,179
Okay.

741
00:48:51,549 --> 00:48:52,783
Look at the sea.

742
00:48:53,784 --> 00:48:56,320
When are we ever going to walk
a dirt path like this again?

743
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:57,555
- I know.
- Right.

744
00:48:58,155 --> 00:49:00,791
It's all thanks to big sis Cho Na Jeong.

745
00:49:01,892 --> 00:49:03,027
Thank you, Cho Na Jeong.

746
00:49:03,027 --> 00:49:04,161
- Right?
- You said you wouldn't come.

747
00:49:04,161 --> 00:49:06,264
All thanks to Cho Na Jeong.

748
00:49:06,264 --> 00:49:07,265
All thanks to me.

749
00:49:35,626 --> 00:49:36,627
Girls.

750
00:49:37,561 --> 00:49:40,398
I feel like it's been forever
since I got a massage.

751
00:49:42,133 --> 00:49:44,368
I should've done things like this sooner.

752
00:49:44,802 --> 00:49:46,637
Aren't you glad we came, Cho Naraeng?

753
00:49:47,371 --> 00:49:48,205
Yeah.

754
00:49:50,141 --> 00:49:51,909
This feels so good.

755
00:49:53,644 --> 00:49:54,812
So refreshing.

756
00:49:58,549 --> 00:50:00,351
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

757
00:50:05,056 --> 00:50:06,123
Abalone.

758
00:50:07,725 --> 00:50:10,328
We're at the seaside,
so we've got to eat abalone.

759
00:50:10,328 --> 00:50:12,229
- They're huge.
- Right?

760
00:50:12,229 --> 00:50:14,398
Eat up and get your strength back.
This is on Producer Noh's card.

761
00:50:15,933 --> 00:50:17,668
Mr. Noh, thank you.

762
00:50:17,668 --> 00:50:19,070
We'll enjoy it.

763
00:50:20,071 --> 00:50:22,506
Look at this abalone, can you believe it?

764
00:50:22,506 --> 00:50:23,608
The cold raw fish soup is so good too.

765
00:50:23,608 --> 00:50:24,508
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

766
00:50:25,409 --> 00:50:26,344
That's it.

767
00:50:27,812 --> 00:50:28,846
Hey, look at that bridge.

768
00:50:29,747 --> 00:50:31,282
It's beautiful.

769
00:50:31,282 --> 00:50:33,451
The night view is insane.

770
00:50:33,451 --> 00:50:34,418
That's a ship?

771
00:50:34,418 --> 00:50:36,420
They say that the ship goes
all the way to Jeju.

772
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:38,222
- Really?
- I see.

773
00:50:38,856 --> 00:50:39,824
What's that one?

774
00:50:40,791 --> 00:50:43,261
Looking at the night view
makes me crave a beer.

775
00:50:43,894 --> 00:50:45,263
Same here.

776
00:50:59,744 --> 00:51:01,345
This is really nice.

777
00:51:04,015 --> 00:51:05,449
Now, spill it, Cho Naraeng.

778
00:51:06,217 --> 00:51:08,586
If you were going to enjoy it this much,
why did you insist on not coming?

779
00:51:09,687 --> 00:51:11,455
Did getting fired make you that depressed?

780
00:51:12,924 --> 00:51:14,191
Of course, I was depressed.

781
00:51:14,926 --> 00:51:16,827
Losing my job was depressing, but...

782
00:51:18,095 --> 00:51:19,130
How do I put it?

783
00:51:20,097 --> 00:51:23,334
I felt this huge wall called "society."

784
00:51:24,068 --> 00:51:27,238
It felt like Cho Na Jeong...

785
00:51:27,571 --> 00:51:29,006
was being rejected.

786
00:51:29,907 --> 00:51:31,075
They'll let me live as somebody's mom,

787
00:51:31,375 --> 00:51:33,611
as somebody's daughter,

788
00:51:33,611 --> 00:51:35,079
but not as Cho Na Jeong.

789
00:51:35,079 --> 00:51:36,147
"Just give it up already."

790
00:51:36,147 --> 00:51:37,982
Feeling like I was being boycotted
like that,

791
00:51:37,982 --> 00:51:39,483
I just sank into this endless gloom.

792
00:51:41,752 --> 00:51:43,020
Why does the world act...

793
00:51:43,621 --> 00:51:45,790
like even a mom having a dream...

794
00:51:46,324 --> 00:51:47,825
is some kind of luxury?

795
00:51:48,893 --> 00:51:51,095
It's that company that's really messed up.

796
00:51:51,095 --> 00:51:53,698
Who treats the person who reported
a rapist like that and kicks her out?

797
00:51:56,801 --> 00:51:59,003
Still, I went all in
and gave it everything I had,

798
00:51:59,003 --> 00:52:00,137
so I don't have any regrets.

799
00:52:01,906 --> 00:52:05,042
Hey, let's stop with the gloomy talk now,

800
00:52:05,042 --> 00:52:06,243
and go hang out downtown.

801
00:52:06,243 --> 00:52:07,979
- Let's go.
- Let's go. Sounds good.

802
00:52:15,987 --> 00:52:19,056
The abalone really are bigger
since we're right at the source.

803
00:52:19,056 --> 00:52:20,424
They're so fresh.

804
00:52:20,424 --> 00:52:22,193
My kids love abalone too.

805
00:52:22,193 --> 00:52:23,461
I should buy some to take home.

806
00:52:23,461 --> 00:52:25,830
Excuse me, can you ship this to Seoul?

807
00:52:25,830 --> 00:52:27,498
Sure, we'll send it right away.

808
00:52:28,532 --> 00:52:29,667
Guys.

809
00:52:29,667 --> 00:52:31,235
Big sis is buying.
Get some for yourselves too.

810
00:52:32,970 --> 00:52:34,005
Ta-da.

811
00:52:35,139 --> 00:52:36,574
One kilogram each, please.

812
00:52:36,574 --> 00:52:37,775
- With this one?
- Yes.

813
00:52:38,976 --> 00:52:39,810
Look at the size.

814
00:52:39,810 --> 00:52:41,946
- They're fresh.
- Super fresh.

815
00:52:43,347 --> 00:52:44,582
- This is fun.
- It is.

816
00:52:44,582 --> 00:52:46,250
Where should we go now?

817
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:47,518
Where should we go?

818
00:52:48,753 --> 00:52:49,887
- Hey.
- Yeah?

819
00:52:50,588 --> 00:52:51,822
Isn't that a fortune-telling shop?

820
00:52:52,456 --> 00:52:54,225
There's a fortune-telling shop out here?

821
00:52:55,626 --> 00:52:56,627
Right.

822
00:52:56,627 --> 00:52:59,797
Last time at that Chinese restaurant,
the fortune cookie said,

823
00:52:59,797 --> 00:53:03,534
"A typhoon begins
with the flap of a butterfly's wings."

824
00:53:03,534 --> 00:53:05,002
That was mine.

825
00:53:05,002 --> 00:53:06,370
- Really?
- Yeah.

826
00:53:06,837 --> 00:53:08,839
Now that I think about it,
it's giving me goosebumps.

827
00:53:08,839 --> 00:53:11,575
- Why?
- Mine said, "Break the mold."

828
00:53:11,575 --> 00:53:14,745
"A new encounter awaits you."

829
00:53:15,746 --> 00:53:17,181
Rebecca and Jessica.

830
00:53:17,515 --> 00:53:18,382
Hey.

831
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:28,392
A woman holding flowers,
a man holding flowers.

832
00:53:30,027 --> 00:53:31,028
Hey, come on.

833
00:53:31,028 --> 00:53:33,798
You can make anything mean anything
if you twist it enough.

834
00:53:33,798 --> 00:53:35,800
So what? It's fun.
Let's go check it out.

835
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:38,836
Let's just go.
None of that stuff ever comes true anyway.

836
00:53:38,836 --> 00:53:40,871
I'm more scared it might come true.

837
00:53:40,871 --> 00:53:42,940
We'll just listen to the good parts.

838
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:44,275
Let's go.

839
00:53:44,275 --> 00:53:46,143
Hey, are we really going?

840
00:53:57,888 --> 00:54:00,558
Well, I...

841
00:54:00,558 --> 00:54:02,293
Don't say a word.

842
00:54:02,627 --> 00:54:03,794
You'll jinx it.

843
00:54:26,851 --> 00:54:30,955
You pulled out a knife,
thinking you'd at least cut up a radish,

844
00:54:31,722 --> 00:54:33,691
but the blade was nowhere to be found,

845
00:54:33,691 --> 00:54:35,793
and only the sheath was left in your hand.

846
00:54:38,496 --> 00:54:42,099
Then where would I find that knife?

847
00:54:42,099 --> 00:54:43,501
What do you want to hold?

848
00:54:43,501 --> 00:54:46,804
A knife, a sickle, or a spoon?

849
00:54:47,204 --> 00:54:49,073
You should think about that first.

850
00:54:51,175 --> 00:54:53,311
A knife, a sickle...

851
00:55:08,526 --> 00:55:11,095
You must have worked quite hard...

852
00:55:11,095 --> 00:55:13,297
trying to open a tightly closed door,

853
00:55:14,298 --> 00:55:17,335
but that door is not one
a person can open.

854
00:55:18,235 --> 00:55:19,236
And yet,

855
00:55:20,037 --> 00:55:24,008
inside that closed door,
the wind is already blowing freely,

856
00:55:25,209 --> 00:55:29,046
meaning your heart
is already pounding wildly.

857
00:55:31,749 --> 00:55:34,352
What does that...

858
00:55:34,352 --> 00:55:35,186
Stop.

859
00:55:35,186 --> 00:55:38,456
When the Dragon King talks like nonsense,
you've got to understand it as sense.

860
00:55:38,456 --> 00:55:39,357
Why are you asking questions?

861
00:56:03,014 --> 00:56:06,083
You may think the land is dried up,

862
00:56:08,719 --> 00:56:12,423
but there are still flower seeds alive,
waiting for the rain.

863
00:56:12,957 --> 00:56:13,824
Sorry?

864
00:56:14,492 --> 00:56:18,129
Soon the soil will soften,
and the rain will fall,

865
00:56:18,863 --> 00:56:21,966
and then the flowers will bloom wide open,

866
00:56:21,966 --> 00:56:23,234
so you should wait.

867
00:56:49,126 --> 00:56:50,094
Il Ri.

868
00:56:50,094 --> 00:56:51,729
- Thanks.
- Welcome.

869
00:56:54,265 --> 00:56:55,099
Thank you.

870
00:57:00,771 --> 00:57:02,473
Guys, but honestly,

871
00:57:02,473 --> 00:57:04,175
wasn't that fortune insanely accurate?

872
00:57:05,142 --> 00:57:06,611
Just the sheath being left behind.

873
00:57:06,611 --> 00:57:08,045
How could it match my situation...

874
00:57:08,045 --> 00:57:10,381
so perfectly?

875
00:57:10,648 --> 00:57:13,284
But what did she mean by telling me...

876
00:57:13,284 --> 00:57:15,586
to think again about what I want to hold?

877
00:57:16,487 --> 00:57:19,423
Does it mean I should look
for a different kind of work?

878
00:57:20,358 --> 00:57:21,525
That could be it.

879
00:57:22,293 --> 00:57:24,362
Who says
you have to be a show host forever?

880
00:57:25,062 --> 00:57:27,865
You could use that experience
to find something else.

881
00:57:27,865 --> 00:57:28,633
Something else?

882
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,969
The most impressive thing
I heard recently was this.

883
00:57:32,503 --> 00:57:35,339
"You can't stop the wind from blowing,"

884
00:57:35,339 --> 00:57:37,508
"but you can change
the direction of the sail."

885
00:57:40,211 --> 00:57:43,414
Hey, then what do you think
your fortune meant?

886
00:57:44,148 --> 00:57:48,085
"There's wind blowing inside
a closed door,"

887
00:57:48,452 --> 00:57:50,388
"and your heart is pounding."

888
00:57:58,029 --> 00:57:58,963
Who knows.

889
00:57:59,363 --> 00:58:02,133
Why is your face suddenly so red?

890
00:58:02,133 --> 00:58:02,934
Wait.

891
00:58:02,934 --> 00:58:05,136
Hey, could it be...

892
00:58:05,136 --> 00:58:07,171
that a man who makes your heart race
has shown up?

893
00:58:07,171 --> 00:58:08,706
No, that's not it.

894
00:58:08,706 --> 00:58:11,542
It is.

895
00:58:11,542 --> 00:58:13,744
No matter who it is, just meet him.

896
00:58:13,744 --> 00:58:15,279
At a time like this,
when your future is so wide open,

897
00:58:15,279 --> 00:58:18,082
you should hurry up
and meet someone and fall hard in love.

898
00:58:18,082 --> 00:58:19,750
I said it's not like that.

899
00:58:22,286 --> 00:58:23,187
Lee Il Ri.

900
00:58:23,521 --> 00:58:25,056
What's with your face since earlier?

901
00:58:26,324 --> 00:58:27,124
What about it?

902
00:58:27,124 --> 00:58:28,392
Out of the three of us,

903
00:58:28,693 --> 00:58:30,928
your fortune was the most romantic.

904
00:58:31,629 --> 00:58:34,332
So you're the land, Lee Il Ri,

905
00:58:34,332 --> 00:58:36,400
and the rain must be Sang Gyu.

906
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,436
And the flowers
blooming wide open mean...

907
00:58:39,236 --> 00:58:41,539
you two might even get married, right?

908
00:58:42,106 --> 00:58:42,940
Yeah.

909
00:58:45,977 --> 00:58:47,078
Marriage, my ass.

910
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:52,483
Hey, did something happen
between you and Sang Gyu?

911
00:58:53,551 --> 00:58:54,418
Nothing happened.

912
00:58:55,319 --> 00:58:56,654
Then why are you acting like this?

913
00:58:57,588 --> 00:58:58,956
Did you fight with Sang Gyu?

914
00:59:01,826 --> 00:59:03,427
She did.

915
00:59:03,427 --> 00:59:05,096
You had a lovers' quarrel.

916
00:59:05,096 --> 00:59:06,998
You poked at Sang Gyu again, didn't you?

917
00:59:07,665 --> 00:59:09,767
Acting tough like a kid,

918
00:59:09,767 --> 00:59:11,369
running your mouth and all that, right?

919
00:59:11,369 --> 00:59:12,470
Come on.

920
00:59:12,937 --> 00:59:14,372
I said no.

921
00:59:15,439 --> 00:59:18,009
Whatever it was, make up quickly.

922
00:59:18,676 --> 00:59:20,845
From what I can see,
Sang Gyu is the best guy...

923
00:59:20,845 --> 00:59:22,713
- out of all the men you've dated.
- Yeah.

924
00:59:22,713 --> 00:59:24,915
I really think you absolutely
have to marry Sang Gyu.

925
00:59:24,915 --> 00:59:26,017
That's right.

926
00:59:26,017 --> 00:59:28,219
Stop it. You don't know anything.

927
00:59:31,422 --> 00:59:33,724
Can't you just say it straight?

928
00:59:33,958 --> 00:59:35,226
How serious is it?

929
00:59:37,862 --> 00:59:38,930
We broke up.

930
00:59:39,463 --> 00:59:40,398
- What?
- What?

931
00:59:42,199 --> 00:59:44,201
Why? Why did you break up?

932
00:59:44,902 --> 00:59:46,037
I told you.

933
00:59:46,037 --> 00:59:47,505
I only dated him
because there was no one else around.

934
00:59:47,505 --> 00:59:49,273
I said if it didn't feel right,
I'd break up right away.

935
00:59:49,907 --> 00:59:52,209
Our personalities didn't match,
and I just couldn't keep seeing him.

936
00:59:52,910 --> 00:59:54,612
He's old-fashioned and clueless.

937
00:59:54,612 --> 00:59:56,981
Lee Il Ri, have you lost your mind?

938
00:59:58,249 --> 01:00:00,251
Being old-fashioned and clueless
is not a reason.

939
01:00:01,218 --> 01:00:03,120
How many times have we told you...

940
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:05,056
to please stop obsessing over appearances?

941
01:00:05,923 --> 01:00:08,159
After everything you went through
with Eom Jong Do, you still don't get it?

942
01:00:08,793 --> 01:00:11,062
Don't say another word
and call Sang Gyu right now.

943
01:00:11,896 --> 01:00:14,098
No. I'll do it.

944
01:00:16,701 --> 01:00:19,203
Please, if you don't know,
just stay out of it.

945
01:00:25,109 --> 01:00:26,377
Why?

946
01:00:26,877 --> 01:00:28,379
What happened?

947
01:00:29,013 --> 01:00:31,449
Did Sang Gyu...

948
01:00:32,817 --> 01:00:34,986
want to break up
because you're menopausal?

949
01:00:36,487 --> 01:00:37,488
That's not it.

950
01:00:39,023 --> 01:00:40,558
What do you mean it's not?

951
01:00:41,359 --> 01:00:43,961
You two were so crazy about each other.
Why would you suddenly break up?

952
01:00:44,328 --> 01:00:45,863
Why break up out of the blue...

953
01:00:45,863 --> 01:00:47,965
with someone who treated you so well?

954
01:00:47,965 --> 01:00:49,233
It's not that.

955
01:00:49,967 --> 01:00:52,169
He kept saying we should hurry
and get married and have a baby first.

956
01:00:52,470 --> 01:00:54,205
He looked at me with those desperate eyes,
saying his dream...

957
01:00:54,205 --> 01:00:55,673
was to have a daughter who looks like me.

958
01:00:56,207 --> 01:00:57,708
So how could I possibly tell him...

959
01:00:57,708 --> 01:00:59,744
that I'm menopausal?

960
01:00:59,744 --> 01:01:02,513
If I did, he would've just swallowed it
and insisted on marrying me anyway.

961
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:04,649
So how could I say it?

962
01:01:08,719 --> 01:01:10,621
I just thought my eggs,

963
01:01:11,889 --> 01:01:13,124
my youth,

964
01:01:14,025 --> 01:01:16,394
would just naturally stay there,
as they were.

965
01:01:20,064 --> 01:01:21,265
But that wasn't the case.

966
01:01:22,767 --> 01:01:25,970
Why did I have to meet
the man I love this late?

967
01:01:27,738 --> 01:01:29,640
My luck is really the worst.

968
01:01:33,177 --> 01:01:34,412
I'm sorry, Il Ri.

969
01:01:40,851 --> 01:01:41,953
I'm sorry,

970
01:01:43,721 --> 01:01:45,089
but could you leave me alone for a bit?

971
01:01:46,057 --> 01:01:47,258
I want to be by myself.

972
01:01:49,026 --> 01:01:49,727
Hey.

973
01:01:50,428 --> 01:01:51,429
Lee Il Ri.

974
01:02:16,153 --> 01:02:17,488
(Naraeng)

975
01:02:18,189 --> 01:02:20,224
Il Ri, where are you?

976
01:02:20,224 --> 01:02:21,359
Why aren't you coming?

977
01:02:25,396 --> 01:02:26,931
(Power off)

978
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:49,186
Sir, check please.

979
01:02:54,191 --> 01:02:56,861
Why isn't she reading the messages?

980
01:02:58,496 --> 01:03:00,765
Hey, should we try calling her?

981
01:03:00,998 --> 01:03:01,832
Yeah.

982
01:03:05,336 --> 01:03:07,171
(Our Il Ri)

983
01:03:08,506 --> 01:03:09,807
The power is turned off.

984
01:03:09,807 --> 01:03:13,577
After the beep,
you'll be connected to voicemail...

985
01:03:21,452 --> 01:03:22,353
All done.

986
01:03:24,789 --> 01:03:26,390
Make sure
to loosen up your shoulders regularly.

987
01:03:27,959 --> 01:03:28,659
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

988
01:03:38,135 --> 01:03:39,937
Why are you overreacting
and crossing the line?

989
01:03:40,938 --> 01:03:43,474
Please read the room
and stop clinging to me.

990
01:03:55,453 --> 01:03:56,354
Doctor.

991
01:03:57,722 --> 01:03:58,723
You haven't left yet?

992
01:03:58,723 --> 01:04:01,626
I stopped by the pharmacy earlier
to get the medicine, and came here,

993
01:04:01,626 --> 01:04:03,561
but I lost the medicine bag.

994
01:04:03,561 --> 01:04:04,362
Just a moment.

995
01:04:04,362 --> 01:04:05,429
Where did it go?

996
01:04:14,205 --> 01:04:15,373
(Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun)

997
01:04:16,173 --> 01:04:17,308
This is it, right?

998
01:04:17,308 --> 01:04:18,943
Yes. Thank you.

999
01:04:21,145 --> 01:04:23,981
I'm sorry,
but what kind of medicine is that?

1000
01:04:23,981 --> 01:04:25,683
This? Hormone drugs.

1001
01:04:26,250 --> 01:04:27,251
Hormone drugs?

1002
01:04:27,718 --> 01:04:29,553
These days, I've been sweating like crazy,

1003
01:04:29,553 --> 01:04:31,923
and my face keeps getting all flushed,
so I went to the hospital.

1004
01:04:31,923 --> 01:04:34,158
They said it's because my hormones
aren't being produced due to menopause.

1005
01:04:34,625 --> 01:04:35,726
Thank you.

1006
01:04:35,726 --> 01:04:36,627
Bye.

1007
01:04:39,363 --> 01:04:40,331
(Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun)

1008
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:43,534
What is this?

1009
01:04:44,869 --> 01:04:46,070
Hey, are you sick or something?

1010
01:04:46,070 --> 01:04:46,904
No.

1011
01:04:47,505 --> 01:04:48,739
It's not that I'm sick.

1012
01:04:49,173 --> 01:04:51,575
I was just tired,
so I bought some vitamins.

1013
01:05:11,562 --> 01:05:13,965
(Estrogen)

1014
01:05:13,965 --> 01:05:16,467
(Hormone therapy
for women before and after menopause)

1015
01:05:19,770 --> 01:05:21,305
Then when you get married,

1016
01:05:22,406 --> 01:05:23,841
do you want to have kids?

1017
01:05:24,275 --> 01:05:25,309
Of course.

1018
01:05:25,309 --> 01:05:27,912
I'd love to have a daughter
who looks just like you.

1019
01:05:28,980 --> 01:05:29,947
Actually,

1020
01:05:30,815 --> 01:05:32,049
I'm an only child.

1021
01:05:32,049 --> 01:05:33,851
So I was really lonely growing up.

1022
01:05:35,052 --> 01:05:37,755
So whenever I saw big, noisy families,

1023
01:05:37,755 --> 01:05:39,357
I used to think
that when I grew up and got married...

1024
01:05:46,430 --> 01:05:49,400
The power is turned off.
After the beep, you'll be connected to...

1025
01:06:21,565 --> 01:06:24,035
Where did she go?

1026
01:06:31,809 --> 01:06:32,710
It's Sang Gyu.

1027
01:06:36,747 --> 01:06:37,682
Yes, Sang Gyu?

1028
01:06:38,149 --> 01:06:39,216
Joo Young.

1029
01:06:40,217 --> 01:06:42,587
I just wanted to ask.

1030
01:06:42,587 --> 01:06:44,055
I can't get through to Il Ri right now.

1031
01:06:44,055 --> 01:06:45,389
Can you reach her by any chance?

1032
01:06:45,990 --> 01:06:46,791
Sang Gyu.

1033
01:06:47,625 --> 01:06:50,695
We came down south on a trip with Il Ri.

1034
01:06:51,495 --> 01:06:54,065
She stepped out earlier in the day
to get some air,

1035
01:06:54,865 --> 01:06:57,134
but we still haven't heard from her.

1036
01:06:57,134 --> 01:06:57,969
What?

1037
01:06:58,703 --> 01:07:01,005
Her phone is off,

1038
01:07:01,005 --> 01:07:02,740
and no matter how much we look,
we can't find her.

1039
01:07:03,808 --> 01:07:06,010
We hope she's okay.

1040
01:07:07,011 --> 01:07:09,614
Hey, you guys should report it
to the police first...

1041
01:07:09,914 --> 01:07:11,248
and keep looking around.

1042
01:07:11,649 --> 01:07:12,650
I'll head there right away.

1043
01:07:13,017 --> 01:07:16,120
Sang Gyu, we're too far away.

1044
01:07:17,088 --> 01:07:17,888
Sang Gyu.

1045
01:07:39,810 --> 01:07:42,013
We came from Seoul,

1046
01:07:42,013 --> 01:07:44,515
and my friend doesn't know
this area at all.

1047
01:07:44,515 --> 01:07:46,550
We also can't get in contact
with her right now.

1048
01:07:46,550 --> 01:07:48,219
She might have gotten lost.

1049
01:07:48,219 --> 01:07:50,688
So could you help us look together?

1050
01:07:50,688 --> 01:07:52,857
Generally speaking,

1051
01:07:52,857 --> 01:07:55,593
if it's just a simple runaway case,
no investigation is launched at all.

1052
01:07:55,593 --> 01:07:58,296
She just went through a breakup.

1053
01:07:58,296 --> 01:07:59,897
And she fought with us too.

1054
01:08:00,598 --> 01:08:03,134
She's in a psychologically unstable state
right now.

1055
01:08:04,001 --> 01:08:06,103
Just wait a little longer.
She might contact you.

1056
01:08:11,409 --> 01:08:12,276
Il Ri.

1057
01:08:13,110 --> 01:08:14,312
Lee Il Ri.

1058
01:08:16,948 --> 01:08:17,949
Lee Il Ri.

1059
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:21,586
Lee Il Ri.

1060
01:08:30,261 --> 01:08:31,395
Yes, Sang Gyu?

1061
01:08:31,395 --> 01:08:34,098
Hey, where are you right now?
I'm almost there.

1062
01:08:34,098 --> 01:08:35,933
What? Already?

1063
01:08:36,801 --> 01:08:39,470
Yeah, I'm almost there now.
Hurry up and tell me where you are.

1064
01:08:40,371 --> 01:08:41,672
We're...

1065
01:08:41,672 --> 01:08:43,674
at Myeongsasip-ri Beach.

1066
01:08:44,342 --> 01:08:45,643
Let's meet at the entrance.

1067
01:08:47,478 --> 01:08:48,346
Okay.

1068
01:08:50,314 --> 01:08:51,415
Il Ri.

1069
01:08:52,483 --> 01:08:53,951
Lee Il Ri.

1070
01:09:02,994 --> 01:09:04,495
- Sang Gyu.
- Hey.

1071
01:09:04,495 --> 01:09:06,998
Hey, where have you checked?

1072
01:09:06,998 --> 01:09:08,733
We've looked around most places.

1073
01:09:08,733 --> 01:09:09,800
What about the sea?
Did you check there?

1074
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:10,801
Not yet.

1075
01:09:10,801 --> 01:09:12,036
- Let's go there first.
- Yes.

1076
01:09:15,106 --> 01:09:16,107
Let's check over there.

1077
01:09:17,308 --> 01:09:19,277
Il Ri.

1078
01:09:20,344 --> 01:09:21,312
Il Ri.

1079
01:09:23,814 --> 01:09:24,782
Il Ri.

1080
01:09:25,683 --> 01:09:26,550
Why?

1081
01:09:28,853 --> 01:09:29,720
What's that?

1082
01:09:46,470 --> 01:09:47,939
Isn't that Il Ri's hat?

1083
01:10:02,119 --> 01:10:02,887
Is it?

1084
01:10:03,220 --> 01:10:04,288
Is that Il Ri's hat?

1085
01:11:24,201 --> 01:11:26,304
(Don't call me ma'am)

1086
01:11:26,704 --> 01:11:30,174
I've never once imagined
a life without Il Ri.

1087
01:11:30,174 --> 01:11:31,142
Ms. Cho?

1088
01:11:31,142 --> 01:11:32,243
You!

1089
01:11:32,243 --> 01:11:34,278
These days,
who waits to be told to go on air?

1090
01:11:34,278 --> 01:11:35,646
You just go for it.

1091
01:11:35,646 --> 01:11:36,614
Hello.

1092
01:11:36,614 --> 01:11:37,748
In this industry...

1093
01:11:37,748 --> 01:11:38,816
Na Jeong, you do YouTube?

1094
01:11:38,816 --> 01:11:41,752
Do something that suits you, not this.

1095
01:11:42,119 --> 01:11:42,987
What do I do?

1096
01:11:42,987 --> 01:11:46,157
This is even tougher than home shopping.

1097
01:11:46,724 --> 01:11:49,493
Who's the man who made your heart
flutter so wildly?

1098
01:11:54,365 --> 01:11:55,132
What is this?

1099
01:11:55,132 --> 01:11:56,767
The Cho Na Jeong I know...

1100
01:11:56,767 --> 01:11:58,936
would never let this broadcast fail.

1101
01:12:01,973 --> 01:12:03,975
