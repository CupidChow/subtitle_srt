Mom, play with me.

Min Woo, I can't.

7
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:07,673
Mom, hurry, let's play.

8
00:01:08,507 --> 00:01:09,575
I can't do it.

9
00:01:10,309 --> 00:01:11,443
I can't.

11
00:01:27,893 --> 00:01:30,028
Mom, I'm here.

- Min Woo.

14

Min Jun, Min Woo, Mom's here.

Here.

17

I'm here.

18
00:01:46,512 --> 00:01:47,546
How adorable.

19
00:01:48,714 --> 00:01:49,781
Good job.

20
00:01:50,048 --> 00:01:51,517
One, two, three.

21
00:02:02,694 --> 00:02:04,263
In my 20s,

22
00:02:04,263 --> 00:02:06,632
I thought 40 would never come.

23
00:02:08,367 --> 00:02:10,836
But now I'm 41.

24
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:13,872
Even by Korean age, I'm 40.

25
00:02:15,107 --> 00:02:16,975
I still feel young at heart,

26
00:02:17,376 --> 00:02:19,578
but the world says I'm middle-aged.

27
00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:23,849
By now, I thought life would be easier,

28
00:02:24,816 --> 00:02:27,085
yet I still stumble and lose my way.

29
00:02:29,588 --> 00:02:30,556

Let's begin.

(Blunt Sister's Sensible Advice)

00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,135
- Hye Jung.
- Yes?

36
00:02:43,335 --> 00:02:45,237
Why do you look so happy today?

37
00:02:45,237 --> 00:02:46,905
Was it that obvious?

38
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:49,641
Everyone, our channel...

39
00:02:49,641 --> 00:02:52,778
finally hit 500,000 subscribers.

40
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:57,616
And that's all thanks
to the Blunt Sister's sharp words...

41
00:02:57,616 --> 00:03:01,053
that have saved countless hearts in love.

42
00:03:01,053 --> 00:03:02,287
I'm honored.

43
00:03:02,888 --> 00:03:06,091
Then, shall we listen to today's story...

44
00:03:06,592 --> 00:03:07,726
from someone waiting for a tough truth?

45
00:03:07,726 --> 00:03:08,594
Let's start.

46
00:03:08,594 --> 00:03:09,428
Go ahead.

47
00:03:10,529 --> 00:03:12,464
I broke up after three years of dating.

48
00:03:12,764 --> 00:03:15,100
I peeked at my ex's Instagram,

49
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,303
and within a week, he'd posted photos
with a new girlfriend.

50
00:03:18,303 --> 00:03:21,473
And that girl is prettier than me.
That's so annoying.

51
00:03:21,473 --> 00:03:23,475
That's totally annoying.

52
00:03:23,475 --> 00:03:25,511
Even when it's over,
you still compare, get bothered,

53
00:03:25,511 --> 00:03:26,545
and your pride gets hurt.

54
00:03:26,545 --> 00:03:28,680
- I really hate that kind of thing.
- Same here.

55
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,882
What should she do?

56
00:03:32,084 --> 00:03:33,185
First,

57
00:03:33,185 --> 00:03:34,753
during this period, above all else,

58
00:03:34,753 --> 00:03:37,923
beware of promotional cosmetic procedures
and impulsive plastic surgery.

59
00:03:37,923 --> 00:03:39,224
- What?
- What?

60
00:03:39,224 --> 00:03:40,158
Because,

61
00:03:40,359 --> 00:03:42,694
while you're busy stalking their feed,

62
00:03:42,694 --> 00:03:44,563
the algorithm that's reading your heart...

63
00:03:44,563 --> 00:03:46,632
will bombard you with ads.

64
00:03:47,399 --> 00:03:48,834
"Add some filler under your eyes."

65
00:03:48,834 --> 00:03:50,402
"Do a lifting procedure.
Try this procedure."

66
00:03:50,402 --> 00:03:52,271
"You can look prettier than her."

67
00:03:52,271 --> 00:03:54,006
But you know
that if you get procedures in this state,

68
00:03:54,006 --> 00:03:55,941
you lose rational thinking, right?

69
00:03:55,941 --> 00:03:57,242
You start with what's necessary,

70
00:03:57,242 --> 00:03:59,411
then one thing leads to another.

71
00:03:59,411 --> 00:04:01,680
The savings you've been building are gone.

72
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,215
And before you know it,

73
00:04:03,215 --> 00:04:05,184
your face is puffed up like a balloon.

(N Life Magazine)

75
00:04:11,823 --> 00:04:12,791
But really,

76
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:15,928
how many people can truly avoid
checking an ex's Instagram?

77
00:04:15,928 --> 00:04:17,529
Nine out of ten probably peek, right?

78
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:19,264
Of course, I totally get that feeling.

79
00:04:19,264 --> 00:04:21,433
But that's exactly when you must be firm.

80
00:04:21,433 --> 00:04:24,102
There's nothing more unattractive
than someone who can't let go.

81
00:04:24,102 --> 00:04:26,872
Then, Deputy Editor,
if Director Jong Do broke up with you,

82
00:04:26,872 --> 00:04:28,807
are you confident you wouldn't cling?

83
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:30,509
Cling?

84
00:04:30,742 --> 00:04:31,577
Woo Ram.

85
00:04:31,944 --> 00:04:34,947
I've stayed loyal, turning down
so many guys who liked me,

86
00:04:34,947 --> 00:04:38,283
just to keep this clean relationship.
And I feel sorry about that.

87
00:04:38,283 --> 00:04:39,218
So if we broke up,

88
00:04:40,118 --> 00:04:42,421
I'd dive headfirst
into the infinite world of freedom.

89
00:04:42,421 --> 00:04:43,522
Cling? No way.

90
00:04:44,723 --> 00:04:45,858

99

to check the lighting angles.

to put things back after drawing?

Mom, my peepee feels tight.

145
00:07:30,155 --> 00:07:32,124

Don't do that.

147
00:07:33,592 --> 00:07:36,195

Give it here.

159
00:08:06,558 --> 00:08:08,560
Why is this so hard to unwrap?

160

163
00:08:16,802 --> 00:08:18,604

Let's go.

165
00:08:26,612 --> 00:08:27,646
Let's go.

166
00:08:32,618 --> 00:08:34,186
Mom, let's go back to the vroom-vroom.

167
00:08:34,186 --> 00:08:35,420
Why?

168
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:38,690
I forgot my wee-woo car there.

169
00:08:39,424 --> 00:08:41,860
Right. I left my candy.

170
00:08:42,661 --> 00:08:43,729
Look.

171
00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:46,532

in the vroom-vroom right now.

Min Woo, there'll be even better treats
where we're going.

173
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:49,801
So let's go now.

174
00:08:50,802 --> 00:08:51,904
Why?

175
00:08:51,904 --> 00:08:53,705
You said if I don't take my toys,

176
00:08:53,705 --> 00:08:56,508
the Toy Fairy will take them.

177
00:08:56,508 --> 00:08:58,877
What if the Fairy takes the candy?

178
00:08:58,877 --> 00:09:00,879
What if the fairy takes it?

179
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:01,847
No, the fairy can't take it.

180
00:09:01,847 --> 00:09:04,416
The fairy can't take it
because it's in the vroom-vroom.

00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:07,186
No, she'll take it.

182
00:09:07,186 --> 00:09:10,322
- No, wee-woo.
- Candy.

183
00:09:10,322 --> 00:09:11,690
Add some filler under your eyes.

184
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:13,325
Get a lifting procedure.

185
00:09:13,325 --> 00:09:15,227
You can look prettier than her.

186
00:09:15,227 --> 00:09:16,962
But you know
that if you get procedures in this state,

187
00:09:16,962 --> 00:09:18,797
you lose rational thinking, right?

188
00:09:18,797 --> 00:09:20,065
You start with what's necessary...

189
00:09:20,065 --> 00:09:21,400
This looks good, right?

190
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,468
Yes, this place had great reviews.

191
00:09:24,269 --> 00:09:25,671
I said no.

192
00:09:25,671 --> 00:09:28,774
- The vroom-vroom.
- Let's go back.

193
00:09:28,774 --> 00:09:31,577
- Mom, the vroom-vroom.
- Wee-woo.

194
00:09:31,577 --> 00:09:34,680
Okay, I'll get it for you.

195
00:09:35,347 --> 00:09:37,249
Act like you don't know her.

196
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:40,819
See? I told you
we should've just gone to her house.

197
00:09:41,053 --> 00:09:42,421
Hey.

198
00:09:43,422 --> 00:09:44,957
Yes.

199
00:09:45,724 --> 00:09:47,025
Vroom-vroom.

200
00:09:47,025 --> 00:09:49,228
Yes, I know. Your aunties are over there.

201
00:09:50,495 --> 00:09:51,930
Let's go say hi to them first.

202
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,461
Is it good?

203
00:10:22,728 --> 00:10:23,529
Yes.

204
00:10:26,665 --> 00:10:27,533
I got your things.

205
00:10:27,533 --> 00:10:29,701
Min Woo and Min Jun, how about
we go to the playroom over there,

206
00:10:29,701 --> 00:10:31,103
play a bit,
and then come back to eat more?

207
00:10:31,103 --> 00:10:32,070
- Okay.
- All right.

208
00:10:33,338 --> 00:10:34,973
- Go have fun.
- Mom, we'll be back.

209
00:10:34,973 --> 00:10:35,774
Okay.

210
00:10:35,774 --> 00:10:36,975
- You can eat.
- Thanks.

211
00:10:40,812 --> 00:10:42,181
- Can I eat this?
- Sure.

212
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:49,655
It's good.

213
00:10:53,525 --> 00:10:55,093
Hey, is someone chasing you or what?

214
00:10:55,093 --> 00:10:56,795
Eat slowly. You'll choke.

215
00:10:56,795 --> 00:10:58,263
I have to eat while I can,

216
00:10:58,497 --> 00:11:00,165
before my kids launch another attack.

217
00:11:03,001 --> 00:11:04,536
Hey, have some of this too.

218
00:11:05,404 --> 00:11:07,739
Thanks. Gu Joo Young, you're the best.

219
00:11:09,741 --> 00:11:12,211
Hey, do your hair once in a while.

220
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,114
And those shoes. Seriously?

221
00:11:16,415 --> 00:11:19,184
If I saw you on the street,
I wouldn't recognize you.

222
00:11:19,184 --> 00:11:20,152
Look who's talking.

223
00:11:21,587 --> 00:11:22,387
You.

224
00:11:23,455 --> 00:11:24,857
I barely recognized you too.

225
00:11:24,857 --> 00:11:26,425
Who is this?

226
00:11:26,425 --> 00:11:27,926
Who is this? Do you know her?

227
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,461
Just eat.

228
00:11:31,029 --> 00:11:33,866
It looks like Min Woo's atopy's gotten
much better, seeing you bring him out.

229
00:11:33,866 --> 00:11:36,435
- Yes, it's almost all gone.
- I see.

230
00:11:36,668 --> 00:11:38,337
Then aren't you going back to work?

231
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,505
My baby's still young.

232
00:11:40,505 --> 00:11:42,541
Wanting to work already would be greedy.

233
00:11:43,242 --> 00:11:45,444
Just watching the kids
grow up healthy is...

234
00:11:46,712 --> 00:11:47,813
is enough to make me happy.

235
00:11:48,614 --> 00:11:50,616
Hey, hurry up
and give Naraeng her present already.

236
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:53,318
I can't wait.

237
00:11:53,318 --> 00:11:55,120
Have a hot night, ma'am.

238
00:12:03,962 --> 00:12:07,266
Did we really not know each other
this well?

239
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:09,801
I'm a C cup.

240
00:12:09,801 --> 00:12:10,502
What?

241
00:12:11,069 --> 00:12:12,337
You? A C cup?

242
00:12:12,337 --> 00:12:15,374
What are you saying?
You're an A cup, a flat A.

243
00:12:15,374 --> 00:12:16,108
Yes.

244
00:12:16,108 --> 00:12:18,443
Well, maybe I gained weight.

245
00:12:18,443 --> 00:12:20,245
Or from breastfeeding.

246
00:12:20,245 --> 00:12:22,714
Cho Naraeng, take better care of yourself.

247
00:12:22,714 --> 00:12:24,283
You've really let go.

248
00:12:24,516 --> 00:12:27,085
Do you know what the counseling topic was
last week on Blunt Sister's?

249
00:12:27,452 --> 00:12:30,689
The reasons men lose sexual attraction
to their wives.

250
00:12:30,689 --> 00:12:32,257
Number one, nagging.

251
00:12:32,257 --> 00:12:33,825
Number two, ruined body shape.

252
00:12:33,825 --> 00:12:35,894
Number three, sloppy outfit.

253
00:12:35,894 --> 00:12:37,663
Seriously?

254
00:12:37,963 --> 00:12:40,265
- That's too aggressive.
- Yes.

255
00:12:40,265 --> 00:12:42,801
Do women really have to manage the house,
raise the kids,

256
00:12:42,801 --> 00:12:44,770
and still keep up perfect self-care?

257
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:46,038
What I'm saying is,

258
00:12:46,038 --> 00:12:49,074
why do married people lose
all sense of sexual tension...

259
00:12:49,074 --> 00:12:50,709
so carelessly?

260
00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:51,743
So?

261
00:12:51,944 --> 00:12:54,379
You think you could keep looking like that
if you got married?

262
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,948
You know I'm not interested in marriage.

263
00:12:57,449 --> 00:12:58,884
- Why? What?
- You?

264
00:12:58,884 --> 00:13:02,721
Stop playing hard to get
and just propose yourself.

265
00:13:02,721 --> 00:13:04,456
Whoever wants it should say so first.

266
00:13:04,456 --> 00:13:06,024
What are you waiting for?

267
00:13:06,024 --> 00:13:08,894
How many times do I have to say it?
I don't want to marry.

268
00:13:09,928 --> 00:13:11,763
Yes, I hear you.

269
00:13:14,566 --> 00:13:17,069
I even booked a dermatologist appointment,
but I can't go now.

270
00:13:17,836 --> 00:13:21,006
Why did the Executive Director
even plan this ridiculous project?

271
00:13:21,006 --> 00:13:22,207
Exactly.

272
00:13:22,207 --> 00:13:24,343
We're going to end up
cleaning up the mess anyway.

273
00:13:24,343 --> 00:13:25,477
Right.

274
00:13:25,477 --> 00:13:27,079
You're here, Executive Director.

275
00:13:28,146 --> 00:13:29,681
Hello.

276
00:13:30,516 --> 00:13:32,451
It must've been tough working
on-site today.

277
00:13:32,451 --> 00:13:34,720
How's the interviewee arrangement going?

278
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,889
I've already booked them.

279
00:13:36,889 --> 00:13:39,791
We're doing this big event
just for that one news segment.

280
00:13:40,492 --> 00:13:42,928
You made sure they memorized
the expected questions, right?

281
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:45,130
Of course, Executive Director.
Don't worry.

282
00:13:48,233 --> 00:13:50,269
And my editor-in-chief is like,

283
00:13:50,269 --> 00:13:53,105
"The age of print is over.
Channel content is the future."

284
00:13:53,105 --> 00:13:54,339
while scolding us to death.

285
00:13:54,339 --> 00:13:55,274
Mom, wipe me.

286
00:13:55,274 --> 00:13:57,609
Okay, here.

287
00:13:57,609 --> 00:13:58,810
Yes, go on.

288
00:13:59,044 --> 00:14:00,846
Meanwhile, the editor...

289
00:14:00,846 --> 00:14:02,981
- Mom, wipe me.
- still clings to print layouts and...

290
00:14:02,981 --> 00:14:03,682
Here.

291
00:14:05,184 --> 00:14:06,251
I see.

292
00:14:09,421 --> 00:14:10,189
Hey.

293
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:13,992
You finally go out after years, and you
couldn't find someone to watch the kids?

294
00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:16,195
I was going to leave them with my husband,

295
00:14:16,195 --> 00:14:17,896
but something came up at his office.

296
00:14:17,896 --> 00:14:18,864
Sorry.

297
00:14:18,864 --> 00:14:20,132
Seriously.

298
00:14:20,132 --> 00:14:21,967
This is why I hate marriage.

299
00:14:22,868 --> 00:14:25,103
When you have kids,
the mom's stuck doing everything.

300
00:14:25,103 --> 00:14:26,772
And yet the country keeps saying
"Have kids."

301
00:14:26,772 --> 00:14:28,207
Like the country's going
to raise them for you.

302
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:29,775
I know, right?

303
00:14:30,642 --> 00:14:32,411
But poor Na Jeong.

304
00:14:32,411 --> 00:14:33,812
She's not someone
who should just rot like this.

305
00:14:34,913 --> 00:14:36,281
Cho Na Jeong.

306
00:14:36,281 --> 00:14:38,617
Stop pretending you're fine
and just be honest already.

307
00:14:39,551 --> 00:14:40,452
What?

308
00:14:40,452 --> 00:14:41,854
I really am fine.

309
00:14:44,623 --> 00:14:46,258
What's with this atmosphere?

310
00:14:46,258 --> 00:14:49,361
Calling someone who's living her life...

311
00:14:49,361 --> 00:14:51,663
"rotting" is crossing the line,
don't you think?

312
00:14:52,197 --> 00:14:53,465
I mean...

313
00:14:54,366 --> 00:14:57,502
I didn't mean
to belittle stay-at-home moms.

314
00:14:57,502 --> 00:14:58,971
Hey, we know you.

315
00:14:59,204 --> 00:15:00,839
You always wanted to keep working.

316
00:15:01,073 --> 00:15:02,241
Not anymore.

317
00:15:02,474 --> 00:15:04,076
Right now, family's what matters most.

318
00:15:05,377 --> 00:15:06,345
Really?

319
00:15:06,645 --> 00:15:07,980
Yes, really.

320
00:15:09,481 --> 00:15:11,817
Why are you
suddenly making me sound pitiful?

321
00:15:13,318 --> 00:15:14,253
No,

322
00:15:14,486 --> 00:15:15,521
I just...

323
00:15:23,629 --> 00:15:24,496
Excuse me.

324
00:15:27,699 --> 00:15:28,567
Hey.

325
00:15:28,834 --> 00:15:31,370
Why are you getting so defensive
over nothing?

326
00:15:45,684 --> 00:15:46,752
What is it all of a sudden?

327
00:15:46,952 --> 00:15:50,556
It looks like there's another problem
with the office server.

328
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,824
It's the server this time?

329
00:15:53,492 --> 00:15:54,993
And last time it was a company dinner.

330
00:15:54,993 --> 00:15:56,895
It's true! Don't you believe me?

331
00:15:56,895 --> 00:15:58,530
Would you believe you?

332
00:16:02,467 --> 00:16:04,303
You can't be late today.

333
00:16:04,303 --> 00:16:06,538
The doctor said 8:30 p.m.

334
00:16:07,172 --> 00:16:08,140
Okay?

335
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,275
Yeah, okay. See you later.

336
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:18,951
Was it your husband?

337
00:16:19,418 --> 00:16:20,219
Yes.

338
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,055
How's Sang Min doing?

339
00:16:23,589 --> 00:16:26,325
My husband said Sang Min's game...

340
00:16:26,325 --> 00:16:27,926
blew up in China.

341
00:16:28,627 --> 00:16:30,863
Yes, it's doing pretty well.

342
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:33,632
That's great.

343
00:16:34,933 --> 00:16:36,101
I'm jealous, you lucky girl.

344
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,772
Last time you said you were trying
for a baby. How's that going?

345
00:16:41,306 --> 00:16:42,508
Are you guys keeping busy?

346
00:16:42,508 --> 00:16:43,775
How many times a week?

347
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:46,111
Not much. We're both busy.

348
00:16:47,212 --> 00:16:48,013
A baby?

349
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,983
Hey, don't.

350
00:16:51,183 --> 00:16:53,619
Haven't you heard "Childless is best?"

351
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:57,556
And if you have one after 40,

352
00:16:57,556 --> 00:16:59,358
You'll go downhill fast.

353
00:16:59,758 --> 00:17:00,626
So don't.

354
00:17:01,593 --> 00:17:03,829
Didn't you just say
raising kids is the greatest joy?

355
00:17:05,163 --> 00:17:07,466
Yes, it is.

356
00:17:07,466 --> 00:17:10,702
Sure, watching them grow is beautiful.

357
00:17:10,702 --> 00:17:12,137
Sure, they're beautiful and all,

358
00:17:12,671 --> 00:17:15,140
but I'm just worried you might struggle.

359
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,341
You're worried that I'll struggle?

360
00:17:17,809 --> 00:17:20,012
You tell someone not to try for a baby…

361
00:17:20,012 --> 00:17:21,146
because you think they’ll struggle?

362
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,216
Gu Joo Young, why do you sound so harsh?

363
00:17:24,216 --> 00:17:25,517
What did I do?

364
00:17:25,784 --> 00:17:27,753
She's the one who started it.

365
00:17:28,921 --> 00:17:30,889
One minute she says
the best thing she's ever done...

366
00:17:30,889 --> 00:17:32,691
is have kids,

367
00:17:32,925 --> 00:17:34,393
and the next she tells me not to have one.

368
00:17:35,928 --> 00:17:37,629
What are you really trying to say?

369
00:17:39,565 --> 00:17:40,365
I just...

370
00:17:44,269 --> 00:17:46,238
Who's the mother of this kid?

371
00:17:47,139 --> 00:17:48,907
Why would you leave a child
unattended in a restaurant?

372
00:17:56,849 --> 00:17:59,017
Min Jun, are you okay?

373
00:18:02,454 --> 00:18:04,356
Na Jeong?

374
00:18:05,457 --> 00:18:06,225
Ye Na.

375
00:18:06,491 --> 00:18:07,993
Is this your son?

376
00:18:10,295 --> 00:18:11,096
Cho Na Jeong?

377
00:18:12,231 --> 00:18:13,165
Long time no see.

378
00:18:14,233 --> 00:18:16,201
- Why wasn't she watching her son?
- Hello, Executive Director.

379
00:18:16,201 --> 00:18:18,170
- How annoying.
- What happened?

380
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:21,440
Well, I was at the salad bar,

381
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,443
and this boy suddenly came up
and touched my butt.

382
00:18:26,845 --> 00:18:29,314
Noh Min Jun, did you really do that?

383
00:18:29,314 --> 00:18:30,148
Yes.

384
00:18:30,148 --> 00:18:32,017
Na Jeong, what were you doing
not watching your kid...

385
00:18:32,017 --> 00:18:33,085
at a restaurant?

386
00:18:34,686 --> 00:18:35,821
I'm sorry, Executive Director.

387
00:18:36,788 --> 00:18:38,190
Ye Na, I'm sorry.

388
00:18:38,624 --> 00:18:39,992
You must've been really startled.

389
00:18:39,992 --> 00:18:41,960
Well, yes, a bit.

390
00:18:42,427 --> 00:18:44,630
Especially since it was my butt,
of all places.

391
00:18:48,133 --> 00:18:49,635
No way! Blunt Sister!

392
00:18:51,036 --> 00:18:52,304
Hello.

393
00:18:52,571 --> 00:18:54,239
I'm a big fan of yours.

394
00:18:57,743 --> 00:19:01,146
I didn't know you two were friends.

395
00:19:05,551 --> 00:19:07,719
Then, enjoy your meal.

396
00:19:09,121 --> 00:19:10,222
I'm sorry, Executive Director.

397
00:19:11,256 --> 00:19:12,524
Ye Na, I'm really sorry.

398
00:19:13,892 --> 00:19:14,726
Okay.

399
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,061
Bye.

400
00:19:16,261 --> 00:19:18,263
She should've gone to a no-kids zone.

401
00:19:18,797 --> 00:19:20,365
Honestly, she's got no sense at all.

402
00:19:22,267 --> 00:19:23,202
Let's go.

403
00:19:23,936 --> 00:19:25,370
Say goodbye to the aunties.

404
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:26,838
Bye.

405
00:19:26,838 --> 00:19:29,141
Hey, you can't just leave like this.

406
00:19:29,141 --> 00:19:31,977
This is your first birthday party out
in six years.

407
00:19:31,977 --> 00:19:32,744
No.

408
00:19:33,278 --> 00:19:35,581
I was reckless to come out with the kids.

409
00:19:35,581 --> 00:19:37,783
Na Jeong, I went too far earlier about...

410
00:19:37,783 --> 00:19:39,818
No, I'm sorry.

411
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:42,721
You tried to celebrate my birthday
and ended up getting scolded.

412
00:19:42,721 --> 00:19:45,023
I shouldn't have suggested
meeting outside.

413
00:19:45,257 --> 00:19:47,025
I just wanted you to get some fresh air.

414
00:19:47,025 --> 00:19:48,727
I know.

415
00:19:49,027 --> 00:19:51,496
But I think it's still just my greed.

416
00:19:51,496 --> 00:19:53,265
I'll call you later. Sorry.

417
00:19:53,265 --> 00:19:55,434
Let's go. Min Woo, Min Jun, let's go.

418
00:20:01,373 --> 00:20:02,174
Hey.

419
00:20:03,141 --> 00:20:04,776
Why did you act so unlike yourself?

420
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,255
Min Jun.

421
00:20:16,655 --> 00:20:17,923
Why did you do that before?

422
00:20:20,726 --> 00:20:22,594
Be honest with me.

423
00:20:23,629 --> 00:20:25,731
Did you really touch the lady's butt?

424
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,536
Min Jun, you learned this at daycare.

425
00:20:30,536 --> 00:20:32,571
You must not touch other people's bodies.

426
00:20:32,571 --> 00:20:33,906
That's Mom.

427
00:20:33,906 --> 00:20:35,207
That's Mom, right?

428
00:20:35,374 --> 00:20:37,176
Why is your photo up there, Mom?

429
00:20:40,546 --> 00:20:41,346
(2018 Cho Na Jeong)

430
00:20:47,586 --> 00:20:48,587
That's not me.

431
00:20:48,854 --> 00:20:49,721
Let's go.

432
00:20:50,689 --> 00:20:52,824
What do you expect me to do
by telling me that now?

433
00:20:53,492 --> 00:20:54,960
If I get fired because of you,

434
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,161
are you going to take responsibility?

435
00:20:59,631 --> 00:21:00,399
Na Jeong.

436
00:21:12,244 --> 00:21:13,512
Talk to me.

437
00:21:13,912 --> 00:21:15,447
Why did you talk to Na Jeong like that?

438
00:21:17,015 --> 00:21:18,350
You can't fool me.

439
00:21:18,717 --> 00:21:19,985
We've been friends for 20 years.

440
00:21:20,752 --> 00:21:22,821
If you're struggling, say so.
If you're upset, say so.

441
00:21:22,821 --> 00:21:24,056
Why can't you just say it?

442
00:21:24,923 --> 00:21:25,824
Exactly.

443
00:21:27,092 --> 00:21:27,893
What is it?

444
00:21:28,663 --> 00:21:31,563
Are you having trouble trying to conceive?

445
00:21:32,631 --> 00:21:33,465
Yeah.

446
00:21:35,734 --> 00:21:37,169
You have no idea how miserable it is...

447
00:21:37,169 --> 00:21:38,737
to sleep with your husband
just to make a baby.

448
00:21:39,738 --> 00:21:42,007
My mom's anxious to death,

449
00:21:42,608 --> 00:21:44,977
the in-laws subtly blame it on my age,

450
00:21:45,444 --> 00:21:47,179
and my husband's not cooperative at all.

451
00:21:48,814 --> 00:21:50,282
It's stressing me out.

452
00:21:51,183 --> 00:21:53,519
But you still want a baby?

453
00:21:56,054 --> 00:21:57,256
I'm 41.

454
00:21:57,923 --> 00:22:00,392
Wait a little
and I won't be able to even if I want one.

455
00:22:02,294 --> 00:22:03,495
What if I regret it?

456
00:22:06,832 --> 00:22:09,468
The Executive Director
personally asked me to do this.

457
00:22:09,468 --> 00:22:11,537
But the friend
who was supposed to be interviewed says...

458
00:22:11,537 --> 00:22:13,939
her kid got sick
and she can't come last minute.

459
00:22:13,939 --> 00:22:16,341
It's going on the news.
We can't just have anyone do it.

460
00:22:16,341 --> 00:22:18,744
How can I do that without any prep?

461
00:22:19,478 --> 00:22:22,814
And honestly,
I don't even look presentable.

462
00:22:22,814 --> 00:22:24,416
I don't even know the event's purpose.

463
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,920
It's about hiring
career-interrupted women.

464
00:22:28,287 --> 00:22:30,756
Sorry. I don't think I can do it.

465
00:22:30,756 --> 00:22:31,723
But...

466
00:22:32,157 --> 00:22:33,258
the reporter says...

467
00:22:33,725 --> 00:22:35,694
their schedule overlapped,
so we have to do it now.

468
00:22:35,694 --> 00:22:36,962
But people haven't even arrived yet.

469
00:22:37,429 --> 00:22:40,532
If you don't help me,
I'll get fired for real.

470
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:47,606
What made you sign up
for this hiring fair?

471
00:22:48,407 --> 00:22:51,343
I used to work as a show host,

472
00:22:51,343 --> 00:22:53,178
but I quit because of my kids...

473
00:22:53,178 --> 00:22:55,113
about six years ago.

474
00:22:55,747 --> 00:22:58,784
Raising kids and running the house,

475
00:22:58,784 --> 00:23:02,020
I realized people called my name
less and less.

476
00:23:02,821 --> 00:23:05,691
So I'm not just here to find a job.

477
00:23:05,924 --> 00:23:08,360
I want to live my life again.

478
00:23:08,627 --> 00:23:10,295
That's why I came.

479
00:23:15,434 --> 00:23:17,169
- Mom.
- Hey.

480
00:23:20,305 --> 00:23:21,406
Thanks, Cho Na Jeong.

481
00:23:22,207 --> 00:23:24,309
If not for you,
we might've lost a whole segment.

482
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:26,044
You're welcome.

483
00:23:26,044 --> 00:23:27,579
All right, take care.

484
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:28,914
Thanks.

485
00:23:30,148 --> 00:23:31,817
Take care, Na Jeong. Thank you.

486
00:23:31,817 --> 00:23:33,418
Great work, Na Jeong.

487
00:23:33,418 --> 00:23:34,453
Okay, let's go.

488
00:23:34,753 --> 00:23:37,823
Hold hands, Min Woo, Min Jun. Let's go.

489
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:39,625

Why?

495
00:24:20,899 --> 00:24:22,201
- Why?
- Hold still.

496
00:24:23,068 --> 00:24:24,369
People are looking.

497
00:24:24,369 --> 00:24:25,304
Hold still.

498
00:24:30,776 --> 00:24:31,610
What?

499
00:24:32,211 --> 00:24:33,145
Your eyelash.

500
00:24:34,513 --> 00:24:36,215
You could've just said so.

501
00:24:40,786 --> 00:24:41,653
Did you put syrup in this?

502
00:24:42,387 --> 00:24:45,057
How many times have I said
I don't take syrup?

503
00:24:45,691 --> 00:24:46,725
Did you?

504
00:24:47,993 --> 00:24:48,961
Do you want me to order another one?

Since we're going to Saipan,
I suggested we go surfing too,

509

and they loved it.

- Yes.

Didn't I?

514
00:25:14,052 --> 00:25:16,255
Why do you never share your schedule?

515
00:25:16,788 --> 00:25:19,992
Do I have to report every little thing?
That's so tacky.

516

do you want to go shopping?

I brewed another batch
and put it in the fridge,

00:26:41,807 --> 00:26:42,741
- Right.
- What?

541
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:46,078
Here's your credit card.

542
00:26:46,678 --> 00:26:47,479
Okay.

543
00:27:18,744 --> 00:27:19,845
Mom.

544
00:27:19,845 --> 00:27:21,613
- My girl.
- Yes?

545
00:27:21,613 --> 00:27:23,515
Did you eat the seaweed soup
I dropped off yesterday?

546
00:27:23,515 --> 00:27:24,616
Yes, of course.

547
00:27:24,616 --> 00:27:26,051
I even went all the way to Majang-dong...

548
00:27:26,051 --> 00:27:28,654
to buy meat and simmer it for hours,

549
00:27:28,654 --> 00:27:30,222
so don't leave any.

550
00:27:30,222 --> 00:27:33,392
That's why it was so delicious.

551
00:27:33,392 --> 00:27:36,094
The rich broth was truly amazing.

552
00:27:36,094 --> 00:27:38,497
Did you have fun with Il Ri and Joo Young?

553
00:27:39,164 --> 00:27:41,533
I'm with them now.

554
00:27:42,668 --> 00:27:45,270
It's been a while since I came downtown
and ate lots of good food...

555
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:47,339
and got some air. This feels amazing.

556
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:50,509
Is Won Bin watching the kids?

557
00:27:51,243 --> 00:27:52,144
Yes.

558
00:27:52,444 --> 00:27:55,013
He even cleared the broadcasts
for my birthday.

559
00:27:55,581 --> 00:27:58,550
He's blunt but actually caring.

560
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:30,048
The number you have dialed is unavailable.
Connecting to voicemail...

561
00:29:32,611 --> 00:29:33,412
Honey.

562
00:29:36,215 --> 00:29:37,149
You're really angry, aren't you?

563
00:29:39,618 --> 00:29:41,453
Honey, wait a second.

564
00:29:41,453 --> 00:29:43,188
What are you doing? No.

565
00:29:43,188 --> 00:29:45,791
That's a Berserk limited edition.
There are only eight of them in Korea.

566
00:29:45,791 --> 00:29:47,059
Don't.

567
00:29:54,366 --> 00:29:55,234
Wait.

568
00:30:06,745 --> 00:30:08,080
Honey, I can explain everything.

569
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,616
So this is a rare item
I've been hunting for months,

570
00:30:10,616 --> 00:30:12,451
and one popped up in Uijeongbu.

571
00:30:12,451 --> 00:30:13,318
I asked them to hold it,

572
00:30:13,318 --> 00:30:15,020
but they said I had to pick it up today
in case I changed my mind.

573
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:17,055
I thought, "What a chance,"
so I rushed right out.

574
00:30:17,055 --> 00:30:19,691
But the Dongbu Highway was jammed,
and I was stuck there forever.

575
00:30:19,691 --> 00:30:21,093
Did you just say "chance?"

576
00:30:22,261 --> 00:30:23,929
Did you just say "chance?"

577
00:30:23,929 --> 00:30:24,863
Let's do it.

578
00:30:25,631 --> 00:30:26,565
Joo Young, let's do it now.

579
00:30:28,901 --> 00:30:29,801
Let's do it now.

580
00:30:30,369 --> 00:30:33,805
It's only been three hours
past our planned time.

581
00:30:33,805 --> 00:30:34,840
Three whole hours...

582
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,842
It's three hours late,
but the egg will be fine.

583
00:30:36,842 --> 00:30:38,010
Should I ask the egg?

584
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:39,645
Egg, how are you? You okay?

585
00:30:40,979 --> 00:30:43,482
It says it's fine, honey.
It says it's fine.

586
00:30:43,482 --> 00:30:44,850
Egg, hang on a bit.

587
00:30:45,184 --> 00:30:46,485
It's okay. Let's do it now.

588
00:30:47,452 --> 00:30:49,288
We can just do it now. It's fine.

589
00:30:55,194 --> 00:30:55,994
Let's do it now.

590
00:30:58,830 --> 00:30:59,631
Hurry.

591
00:31:23,622 --> 00:31:25,824
Honey, because of the traffic jam,

592
00:31:25,824 --> 00:31:27,359
I didn't get to eat dinner.
Maybe that's why.

593
00:31:28,727 --> 00:31:30,362
Why won't he listen?

594
00:31:30,362 --> 00:31:32,364
I told him to listen.

595
00:31:33,332 --> 00:31:36,001
And lately I've been working out hard.

596
00:31:37,636 --> 00:31:38,770
Be quiet.

597
00:31:46,011 --> 00:31:47,012
I think these days...

598
00:31:48,247 --> 00:31:49,481
I'm under a lot of stress.

599
00:31:50,082 --> 00:31:52,818
I can't focus well.

600
00:31:53,685 --> 00:31:54,520
"These days?"

601
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,622
"These days?"

602
00:31:56,622 --> 00:31:57,456
Okay.

603
00:31:59,258 --> 00:32:00,292
Then, how about...

604
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:05,364
we make it exciting and go to a motel?

605
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:08,901
Now?

606
00:32:09,067 --> 00:32:10,369
Not now.

607
00:32:11,537 --> 00:32:12,871
Maybe tomorrow would be good.

608
00:32:12,871 --> 00:32:15,941
Didn't I tell you
I'm busy starting tomorrow?

609
00:32:15,941 --> 00:32:18,610
How can you not listen
to a single word I say?

610
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:19,444
Damn it.

611
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:33,625
Honey, I'm really sorry.

612
00:32:34,526 --> 00:32:37,896
I got out of the taxi
and was walking here,

613
00:32:37,896 --> 00:32:41,033
and I tripped over there.

614
00:32:41,033 --> 00:32:43,202
But even if it looks like this,
the taste...

615
00:32:45,771 --> 00:32:46,872
It tastes fine.

616
00:32:46,872 --> 00:32:47,906
Here.

617
00:32:47,906 --> 00:32:48,740
Don't.

618
00:32:51,577 --> 00:32:52,845
Who did you drink with?

619
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:57,916
A PD I know said he really needed to talk.

620
00:32:57,916 --> 00:32:58,984
About what?

621
00:32:59,618 --> 00:33:01,253
What was it that
you couldn't even tell him...

622
00:33:01,253 --> 00:33:03,222
you had to go home
for your wife's birthday?

623
00:33:04,923 --> 00:33:07,226
I'm not asking for anything big.

624
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:09,161
I just want...

625
00:33:10,462 --> 00:33:12,931
to go out freely for once.

626
00:33:13,432 --> 00:33:16,635
To eat comfortably with my friends once.

627
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:18,403
Is that such a hard thing to ask?

628
00:33:20,572 --> 00:33:21,740
Honey.

629
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:23,275
Honey, I'm really sorry.

630
00:33:23,275 --> 00:33:25,611
But I even bought you a gift.

631
00:33:25,611 --> 00:33:27,246
Can't you at least open it before you go?

632
00:33:34,219 --> 00:33:35,020
Here.

633
00:33:38,924 --> 00:33:40,492
Open it.

634
00:33:40,826 --> 00:33:43,195
I really thought hard picking this out.

635
00:33:43,529 --> 00:33:46,698
What does my lovely wife really need?

636
00:33:46,698 --> 00:33:47,900
I pondered and pondered...

637
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,869
Come on, open it.

638
00:33:57,042 --> 00:33:58,277
Pretty, right?

639
00:33:58,277 --> 00:34:00,512
Remember when
you were watching "My Stay"...

640
00:34:00,512 --> 00:34:02,881
and said this was so pretty?

641
00:34:02,881 --> 00:34:05,217
Let me put it on you.

642
00:34:05,217 --> 00:34:06,118
Wait.

643
00:34:09,655 --> 00:34:10,622
This is...

644
00:34:11,823 --> 00:34:13,025
waterproof too.

645
00:34:13,525 --> 00:34:16,361
You always said your front gets wet
all the time, right?

646
00:34:16,361 --> 00:34:17,829
I remembered that.

647
00:34:20,999 --> 00:34:22,334
It's really pretty.

648
00:34:30,242 --> 00:34:31,076
What's wrong?

649
00:34:33,212 --> 00:34:34,112
Honey.

650
00:34:35,414 --> 00:34:37,583
Do you think I do the dishes
because I enjoy it?

651
00:34:38,183 --> 00:34:40,552
Do you think I live like this
because I like it?

652
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,454
No.

653
00:34:44,022 --> 00:34:45,257
Honestly,

654
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:48,360
I want to work again.

655
00:34:50,395 --> 00:34:51,296
But...

656
00:34:53,498 --> 00:34:55,934
if I said that,
I thought I'd sound so selfish.

657
00:34:56,201 --> 00:34:57,469
That's why I didn't say it.

658
00:35:05,844 --> 00:35:07,779
Honey, don't cry.

659
00:35:23,395 --> 00:35:26,798
The pants I'll show you today
aren't just any old pants.

660
00:35:26,798 --> 00:35:30,335
Once people try them,
they regret buying only one or two.

661
00:35:30,335 --> 00:35:32,170
They want to stock up.

662
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:35,073
These are the pants
that got tons of rave reviews.

663
00:35:35,073 --> 00:35:36,108
That's right.

664
00:35:36,108 --> 00:35:37,943
- I'm so excited.
- Yes.

665
00:35:37,943 --> 00:35:40,412
When you touch it,

666
00:35:40,412 --> 00:35:42,648
you'll notice the difference.

667
00:35:42,648 --> 00:35:44,383
This firm elasticity...

668
00:35:44,383 --> 00:35:46,752
and even this soft touch.

669
00:35:47,286 --> 00:35:49,888
It's made with spandex material,

670
00:35:50,889 --> 00:35:52,257
so it's really comfortable,

671
00:35:52,257 --> 00:35:55,160
yet the knees never stretch out.

672
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,028
See?

673
00:35:56,662 --> 00:35:59,464
Instead, it hugs you firmly.

674
00:35:59,464 --> 00:36:00,265
Right?

675
00:36:00,265 --> 00:36:02,267
And it's super easy to wash.

676
00:36:02,267 --> 00:36:03,802
You can just throw it in the machine.

677
00:36:03,802 --> 00:36:06,438
It hardly shrinks or stretches.

678
00:36:06,438 --> 00:36:09,808
And most importantly,
it doesn't bleed color.

679
00:36:09,808 --> 00:36:10,943
Exactly.

680
00:36:10,943 --> 00:36:13,178
This is why people say
they wear this every day.

681
00:36:13,178 --> 00:36:14,379
You see why, right?

682
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:19,151
Over 500 people are calling
to order right now.

683
00:36:19,852 --> 00:36:22,688
It feels like today could be...

684
00:36:22,688 --> 00:36:25,123
a rare sellout in jewelry history.

685
00:36:25,357 --> 00:36:27,059
Indeed, our customers know...

686
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:30,295
what truly good products
and valuable choices are.

687
00:36:30,295 --> 00:36:32,030
They have exceptional taste.

688
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:33,799
- That's right.
- Yes.

689
00:36:34,333 --> 00:36:36,635
And as we speak,

690
00:36:36,635 --> 00:36:39,371
today's stock is completely sold out.

691
00:36:39,872 --> 00:36:41,073
Thank you.

692
00:36:48,313 --> 00:36:52,050
And this is how
my 41st birthday passes.

693
00:36:53,752 --> 00:36:55,554
When I was young,

694
00:36:55,554 --> 00:36:57,623
I thought I'd be living
quite splendidly by now.

695
00:36:58,991 --> 00:37:01,093
But why does it feel...

696
00:37:01,693 --> 00:37:04,997
like I'll end up old and small,
with nothing accomplished?

(Home Shopping Reemployment Job Fair)

699
00:37:13,005 --> 00:37:15,140
Mom, I need to pee.

700
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:17,376
My little Min Jun.

701
00:37:17,376 --> 00:37:19,044
You didn't wet the bed and got up.

702
00:37:19,044 --> 00:37:20,746
Good job.

703
00:37:20,746 --> 00:37:23,081
Let's go to the bathroom.

704
00:37:23,081 --> 00:37:24,149
Good boy.

705
00:37:25,517 --> 00:37:26,385
Okay.

706
00:37:29,855 --> 00:37:31,089
But, Min Jun,

707
00:37:32,591 --> 00:37:36,395
why did you touch
that lady's butt earlier today?

708
00:37:38,564 --> 00:37:39,464
You know,

709
00:37:40,065 --> 00:37:43,635
you can't touch other people's bodies...

710
00:37:43,635 --> 00:37:44,736
without their permission.

711
00:37:45,671 --> 00:37:48,874
Let's not do that again, all right?

712
00:37:49,541 --> 00:37:52,244
I didn't touch her butt.

713
00:37:53,011 --> 00:37:54,746
I touched the strawberry.

714
00:37:55,514 --> 00:37:56,281
Strawberry?

715
00:37:56,782 --> 00:38:01,620
She had a strawberry on her bag.

716
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:02,588
It was pretty.

717
00:38:04,122 --> 00:38:06,592
Mom, I drew a strawberry.

718
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:08,026
Mom, I like strawberries.

719
00:38:08,026 --> 00:38:09,394
I like strawberries too.

720
00:38:12,798 --> 00:38:16,768
But the lady pushed me,
and I got this scrape.

721
00:38:18,637 --> 00:38:20,806
I see.

722
00:38:21,874 --> 00:38:23,575
I didn't even know that,

723
00:38:23,575 --> 00:38:27,479
and I got mad at you more
because I was embarrassed.

724
00:38:27,479 --> 00:38:28,313
Sorry.

725
00:38:28,647 --> 00:38:30,415
What were you embarrassed about?

726
00:38:30,415 --> 00:38:31,817
Were you embarrassed about me?

727
00:38:32,084 --> 00:38:34,453
No, that's not it.

728
00:38:35,454 --> 00:38:36,421
Me.

729
00:38:36,855 --> 00:38:38,123
I was embarrassed about myself.

730
00:38:39,091 --> 00:38:39,958
I'm sorry.

731
00:39:12,891 --> 00:39:13,792
Guys.

732
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:18,597
I wanted to say thank you
and sorry for today.

733
00:39:19,431 --> 00:39:22,568
I'd been so excited for days
to see you guys,

734
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:24,369
but I ruined everything.

735
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:27,372
You know I love you guys
like crazy, right?

736
00:39:37,716 --> 00:39:39,084
Na Jeong.

737
00:39:40,085 --> 00:39:41,053
I'm the one who's sorry.

738
00:39:41,954 --> 00:39:43,388
I was too harsh.

739
00:39:44,389 --> 00:39:47,059
I was twisted up
and got defensive for no reason.

740
00:39:48,493 --> 00:39:49,661
Actually,

741
00:39:50,796 --> 00:39:52,564
because I've been trying
for a baby lately...

742
00:39:52,564 --> 00:39:55,000
No, you were right.

743
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,835
I pretended to be happy...

744
00:39:56,835 --> 00:39:58,904
because I was scared.

745
00:39:58,904 --> 00:40:00,906
I snapped because I felt inferior.

746
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:03,242
Honestly,

747
00:40:03,742 --> 00:40:05,511
I feel like I'll die
if I can't work again.

748
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:10,716
But I didn't say it out loud
because I thought it'd make me feel worse.

749
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:12,718
I lied to you all.

750
00:40:13,652 --> 00:40:15,053
Even to myself.

751
00:40:18,857 --> 00:40:20,659
Honey, I'll be there soon.

752
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:22,461
Hurry.

753
00:40:26,098 --> 00:40:27,766
Then do it, girl.

754
00:40:27,766 --> 00:40:29,535
It looks like Min Woo
is all better now too.

755
00:40:29,535 --> 00:40:30,502
Why are you hesitating?

756
00:40:30,903 --> 00:40:32,571
It's honestly a waste
for someone as capable as you...

757
00:40:32,571 --> 00:40:34,473
to be living like that.

758
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:38,177
You think so?

759
00:40:38,744 --> 00:40:40,078
You think I really should try again?

760
00:40:40,078 --> 00:40:41,046
Of course.

761
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:42,347
Sure.

762
00:40:44,016 --> 00:40:45,951
But I'm already over 40.

763
00:40:46,385 --> 00:40:48,220
And I'm still worried about the kids.

764
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,121
Look at you.

765
00:40:49,454 --> 00:40:52,057
Who even thinks
so old-fashioned these days?

766
00:40:52,057 --> 00:40:54,793
They say now you should
multiply your age by 0.8.

767
00:40:54,793 --> 00:40:55,827
Then how old are we?

768
00:40:57,663 --> 00:40:58,830
We're 32.

769
00:41:01,066 --> 00:41:02,334
And someone said this too.

770
00:41:03,435 --> 00:41:05,304
Don't live feeling resentful.

771
00:41:05,604 --> 00:41:07,206
Live feeling sorry.

772
00:41:54,186 --> 00:41:56,054
How's your stomach?

773
00:41:56,355 --> 00:41:57,356
I'm dying.

774
00:41:58,991 --> 00:42:01,493
Why did you have to drink
like there's no tomorrow?

775
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:06,231
Hey, honey.

776
00:42:06,231 --> 00:42:10,102
How would you feel
if I started working again?

777
00:42:10,102 --> 00:42:11,003
That's unexpected.

778
00:42:11,803 --> 00:42:12,871
What do you mean, unexpected?

779
00:42:12,871 --> 00:42:15,140
I told you yesterday
I wanted to work again.

780
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:16,108
What kind of work?

781
00:42:16,108 --> 00:42:18,844
What kind?
Obviously, a show host.

782
00:42:20,212 --> 00:42:21,446
Will that even work now?

783
00:42:23,182 --> 00:42:24,049
Why not?

784
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:27,553
Just because I took six years off,
you think I can't do it?

785
00:42:27,786 --> 00:42:30,656
I'm Cho Na Jeong
who used to pull in 4,000 per minute.

786
00:42:30,656 --> 00:42:32,324
- Don't you remember?
- Well,

787
00:42:32,324 --> 00:42:35,093
being a show host
while raising kids isn't easy.

788
00:42:35,093 --> 00:42:36,929
Wouldn't it be better
to find something else to do?

789
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:39,331
Like what?
But being a show host is what I do best.

790
00:42:39,331 --> 00:42:41,600
I mean, I don't even have steady hours,

791
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,902
and if you start an irregular job too,
what about the kids?

792
00:42:43,902 --> 00:42:45,137
We can hire a babysitter.

793
00:42:45,137 --> 00:42:47,706
Childcare systems are great these days.

794
00:42:49,174 --> 00:42:50,676
Fine then, look into it if you want.

795
00:42:51,743 --> 00:42:54,012
Why do you sound so lukewarm about it?

796
00:42:57,516 --> 00:42:58,450
And honey.

797
00:43:00,285 --> 00:43:03,889
Next time you go out,
I promise to watch the kids.

798
00:43:05,824 --> 00:43:06,658
I'll go now.

799
00:43:07,559 --> 00:43:09,328
Bye.

800
00:43:14,666 --> 00:43:16,602
Hello, ma'am.

801
00:43:17,603 --> 00:43:20,672
I was going to call you
since the lease is ending soon.

802
00:43:22,174 --> 00:43:22,941
What?

803
00:43:23,909 --> 00:43:26,111
- Thank you.
- I'll get back to you.

804
00:43:26,111 --> 00:43:28,013
Yes, take care.

805
00:43:28,013 --> 00:43:28,914
You're here.

806
00:43:28,914 --> 00:43:31,483
The landlord said they wanted
to extend the contract last time.

807
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:33,418
Why the sudden change of heart?

808
00:43:33,418 --> 00:43:35,954
They called in a rush yesterday...

809
00:43:35,954 --> 00:43:39,091
and said their son's getting married
and needs to move in right away.

810
00:43:39,091 --> 00:43:41,260
So they can't extend.

811
00:43:42,594 --> 00:43:46,598
But finding a place in this area
won't be easy.

812
00:43:47,099 --> 00:43:49,401
You came in at such a low price,

813
00:43:49,401 --> 00:43:51,670
and now most are switching
to monthly rent.

814
00:43:52,738 --> 00:43:53,972
So what now?

815
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:56,875
Should I check somewhere on the outskirts?

816
00:43:56,875 --> 00:43:58,277
- The outskirts?
- Yes.

817
00:43:58,277 --> 00:43:59,778
No way.

818
00:43:59,778 --> 00:44:03,015
Could you please check...

819
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:04,783
if there are any good listing nearby?

820
00:44:07,085 --> 00:44:09,288
You really worked hard today.

821
00:44:09,288 --> 00:44:10,989
Please let me know
if there's a good place.

822
00:44:10,989 --> 00:44:12,424
Don't worry.
Trust me.

823
00:44:12,424 --> 00:44:13,592
Okay, take care.

824
00:44:13,592 --> 00:44:15,194
- Thanks for the drink.
- Sure.

825
00:44:27,272 --> 00:44:29,274
I'm so frustrated.

826
00:44:29,274 --> 00:44:32,110
Why do housing prices nowadays
keep going up...

827
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:34,046
beyond anyone's reach?

828
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:37,249
So, there's really nowhere worth going?

829
00:44:37,249 --> 00:44:38,917
Nowhere.

830
00:44:38,917 --> 00:44:40,586
I was about to start working again,

831
00:44:40,586 --> 00:44:43,155
and now housing is tying me down.

832
00:44:44,756 --> 00:44:47,025
Is this a sign from heaven
to devote myself to home?

833
00:44:47,025 --> 00:44:48,961
Don't be ridiculous.

834
00:44:48,961 --> 00:44:51,296
While you're at it,
do at least something.

835
00:44:51,296 --> 00:44:53,665
If you drift like this,
you'll hit 50 in no time,

836
00:44:53,665 --> 00:44:56,101
and returning to work will really be over.

837
00:44:56,401 --> 00:44:58,570
You're at the cutoff age right now.

838
00:44:59,204 --> 00:45:00,772
I know that.

839
00:45:00,772 --> 00:45:03,675
But what do I do when I don't even
have a place to move to right now?

840
00:45:03,675 --> 00:45:05,310
Rent monthly for now,

841
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:06,612
get a job and earn money,

842
00:45:06,612 --> 00:45:08,981
then look for a place again.

843
00:45:08,981 --> 00:45:10,983
You need that kind of determination
if you want to work again.

844
00:45:12,317 --> 00:45:13,452
I don't know.

845
00:45:14,686 --> 00:45:17,022
Why is it so hard
to just say "Let's do that?"

846
00:45:19,324 --> 00:45:20,993
By the way, what about you?

847
00:45:20,993 --> 00:45:22,461
Did Eom Jong Do get back from Saipan?

848
00:45:22,661 --> 00:45:24,563
Yeah, he's back.

849
00:45:24,563 --> 00:45:25,664
What souvenir did he bring?

850
00:45:25,664 --> 00:45:28,634
Don't tell me some ridiculous
fridge magnet again.

851
00:45:28,634 --> 00:45:31,837
Who buys souvenirs these days
for going on a short business trip?

852
00:45:31,837 --> 00:45:32,771
Why not?

853
00:45:32,771 --> 00:45:34,806
You bring lots of gifts back
from business trips.

854
00:45:35,207 --> 00:45:38,377
Don't just let him mooch off you
just because you're older.

855
00:45:38,377 --> 00:45:39,778
You mooch off him too.

856
00:45:40,179 --> 00:45:42,548
That's why he treats you
like a walking wallet.

857
00:45:42,548 --> 00:45:44,816
I mooch too.

858
00:45:44,816 --> 00:45:46,685
What'd you mooch?

859
00:45:48,387 --> 00:45:51,123
Hey, the editor-in-chief wants me.

860
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:52,224
I'll call you later.

861
00:45:53,825 --> 00:45:57,196
She always drops brutal truths
with a smile and riles me up.

862
00:46:00,632 --> 00:46:02,301
(Are you in Seoul?)

863
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:04,503
Why's this brat ghosting my texts?

864
00:46:06,738 --> 00:46:08,240
Eom Jong Do's really changed.

865
00:46:08,907 --> 00:46:11,710
He used to wait by the phone
just for my calls.

866
00:46:15,948 --> 00:46:17,583
Why aren't you texting me?

867
00:46:18,417 --> 00:46:19,484
Are you that busy?

868
00:46:33,498 --> 00:46:36,735
(Why aren't you texting me?
Are you that busy?)

869
00:46:49,147 --> 00:46:50,215
((Ad) Silky hair)

870
00:46:50,215 --> 00:46:51,316
(Summer Vacation Special Promotion)

871
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:57,856
Let's go with the flow.

872
00:46:59,625 --> 00:47:02,027
"Go with the flow?"
When did I ever not?

873
00:47:02,661 --> 00:47:03,529
Honey.

874
00:47:04,463 --> 00:47:05,297
Think about it.

875
00:47:06,131 --> 00:47:08,267
What do you think makes sense?
Living with the kids in a motel block,

876
00:47:08,267 --> 00:47:10,969
or paying 2,000 a month
when we can barely afford it?

877
00:47:10,969 --> 00:47:12,871
So if I start working again,

878
00:47:12,871 --> 00:47:15,707
it'll help with our finances too.
Two birds with one stone.

879
00:47:15,707 --> 00:47:17,543
To do that, we need a place nearby.

880
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:20,479
In the middle of all this,
you're thinking about work?

881
00:47:20,479 --> 00:47:22,781
For now, putting out the fire first
is going with the flow.

882
00:47:23,248 --> 00:47:25,184
Do you know how old I am?

883
00:47:25,184 --> 00:47:26,418
If I drag my feet any longer,

884
00:47:26,418 --> 00:47:28,921
finding a job will really get hard.

885
00:47:28,921 --> 00:47:30,289
That's exactly my point.

886
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:32,824
At your age,

887
00:47:32,824 --> 00:47:34,993
you think deciding to work
makes a job appear?

888
00:47:34,993 --> 00:47:36,261
Good grief.

889
00:47:36,261 --> 00:47:37,829
- Seriously?
- And to be blunt,

890
00:47:37,829 --> 00:47:39,364
even if we move,

891
00:47:39,364 --> 00:47:41,300
you can find some job you can do there.

892
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:43,669
why be picky about doing
what you want at your age?

893
00:47:43,669 --> 00:47:44,436
Am I wrong?

894
00:47:45,704 --> 00:47:48,440
Anyway, don't take it too hard.

895
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:49,975
We'll talk when I'm back. Bye.

896
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:53,045
Right, and the braised tofu was good.

897
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:58,350
What's wrong with my age?

898
00:48:12,531 --> 00:48:13,365
Hello?

899
00:48:13,365 --> 00:48:14,733
Ms. Cho, where are you?

900
00:48:14,733 --> 00:48:16,869
There's a place for rent
in the complex at a cheap price.

901
00:48:16,869 --> 00:48:17,769
Really?

902
00:48:18,136 --> 00:48:20,339
Yes, ma'am. I'm on my way.

903
00:48:20,339 --> 00:48:22,908
I'm literally running now.
Please wait a bit.

904
00:48:22,908 --> 00:48:24,376
Yes, we're coming.

905
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:27,813
They just came by
but haven't decided yet.

906
00:48:27,813 --> 00:48:29,114
Thank goodness.

907
00:48:29,114 --> 00:48:31,316
The owner has three homes.

908
00:48:31,316 --> 00:48:33,318
No loans, very clean.

909
00:48:33,852 --> 00:48:35,921
The previous tenant
suddenly had to go abroad,

910
00:48:35,921 --> 00:48:38,457
and will leave furniture
and appliances if needed.

911
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:40,225
- Jackpot.
- Total jackpot.

912
00:48:40,225 --> 00:48:41,827
- Hurry, let's go check it out.
- Yes.

913
00:48:42,361 --> 00:48:45,063
I'm happy for you.
We have to hurry.

914
00:48:45,063 --> 00:48:46,865
Please wait.

915
00:48:47,566 --> 00:48:48,600
Thank you.

916
00:48:53,939 --> 00:48:55,207
What floor was it?

917
00:48:55,574 --> 00:48:56,742
Eleventh.

918
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:09,988
Text the owner...

919
00:49:09,988 --> 00:49:11,790
that I'll wire the holding deposit
in ten minutes.

920
00:49:12,457 --> 00:49:14,426
When the door opens, run straight ahead.

921
00:49:14,426 --> 00:49:15,460
It's unit 1106.

922
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:17,963
But they got on the elevator first.

923
00:49:18,263 --> 00:49:19,498
I feel bad about it.

924
00:49:20,933 --> 00:49:24,369
Our Father forgives the houseless.

925
00:49:24,369 --> 00:49:25,204
Good luck.

926
00:49:46,859 --> 00:49:49,161
- We got here first.
- It's not that way.

927
00:49:49,161 --> 00:49:51,163
It's not there. Come.

928
00:49:51,163 --> 00:49:52,898
It's not that way.
It's this way.

929
00:49:52,898 --> 00:49:54,366
- Hurry.
- Run.

930
00:49:56,602 --> 00:49:58,003
Faster.

931
00:49:58,003 --> 00:49:59,938
It's not there.

932
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:04,309
Come on.

933
00:50:26,331 --> 00:50:27,733
Sorry.

934
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:29,034
I pressed it first.

935
00:50:36,708 --> 00:50:38,911
How are you so fast?

936
00:50:39,645 --> 00:50:41,980
You must've been athletic back in the day.

937
00:50:42,981 --> 00:50:45,784
I really hate losing, that's all.

938
00:50:45,784 --> 00:50:47,186
Me too.

939
00:50:47,186 --> 00:50:49,621
When I saw that lady earlier...

940
00:50:49,855 --> 00:50:51,957
She's here.

941
00:50:53,158 --> 00:50:54,693
Say hello.
She's the owner of the house.

942
00:50:54,693 --> 00:50:55,827
Hello.

943
00:50:55,827 --> 00:50:57,629
- Ma'am, could I get a glass of water?
- Sure.

944
00:50:59,464 --> 00:51:01,567
Once I said I'd sign with you,

945
00:51:01,567 --> 00:51:04,236
every real estate office
kept calling nonstop.

946
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:07,472
It makes me think
I should switch to monthly next time.

947
00:51:07,472 --> 00:51:10,642
Don't say that.

948
00:51:10,642 --> 00:51:12,978
You'll scare the tenant.

949
00:51:14,246 --> 00:51:15,547
Cheer up.

950
00:51:15,547 --> 00:51:19,151
She doesn't change her mind easily.

951
00:51:30,696 --> 00:51:31,597
Jjon Na Jeong?

952
00:51:35,767 --> 00:51:39,104
You used to live in Hanmae-dong.

953
00:51:39,371 --> 00:51:40,772
You're Cho Na Jeong, aren't you?

954
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:43,008
Yes.

955
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:46,678
It's me, Mi Sook.

956
00:51:47,312 --> 00:51:49,047
Yang Mi Sook.

957
00:51:54,586 --> 00:51:56,054
(Cho Na Jeong)

958
00:51:56,054 --> 00:51:57,956
Yang Mi Sook, anywhere you want to go?

959
00:51:57,956 --> 00:51:59,291
How about a karaoke?

960
00:51:59,925 --> 00:52:02,227
There's a karaoke right up front.
Should we go there?

961
00:52:02,227 --> 00:52:03,128
Hey.

962
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:05,030
Why are you ignoring me?

963
00:52:05,697 --> 00:52:07,599
I didn't see you, so what?

964
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:09,535
Bullshit.

965
00:52:10,769 --> 00:52:11,637
Who's that?

966
00:52:12,304 --> 00:52:14,673
Her? The class president.

967
00:52:15,474 --> 00:52:17,743
She grinds alone to succeed
and studies like a maniac.

968
00:52:17,743 --> 00:52:18,744
She's ruthless.

969
00:52:19,811 --> 00:52:21,580
But she's kind of cute.

970
00:52:22,247 --> 00:52:24,550
You crazy bastard,
are you out of your mind?

971
00:52:24,550 --> 00:52:26,285
Fine. Just find someone
so we can pair off.

972
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:28,187
Hey, Jjon Na Jeong.

973
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:31,056
Since we're unpaired right now,

974
00:52:31,323 --> 00:52:33,559
how about hitting a karaoke
for just two hours?

975
00:52:36,161 --> 00:52:36,962
And of course,

976
00:52:37,696 --> 00:52:38,830
you're paying.

977
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:43,101
Does your mom know
this is what you're doing?

978
00:52:43,101 --> 00:52:44,236
What?

979
00:52:44,236 --> 00:52:46,905
I was in the teachers' office last time,

980
00:52:46,905 --> 00:52:49,141
and your mom was bawling
in front of our homeroom teacher.

981
00:52:49,741 --> 00:52:52,911
Yang Mi Sook, we're almost in high school.

982
00:52:52,911 --> 00:52:54,947
How long are you going to keep
wasting time like this?

983
00:52:54,947 --> 00:52:56,148
What are you going to do with your life?

984
00:52:56,148 --> 00:52:58,383
You crazy bitch.
Who are you to lecture me?

985
00:52:58,383 --> 00:52:59,251
Let go.

986
00:52:59,251 --> 00:53:01,253
- Let go!
- Stop it.

987
00:53:01,253 --> 00:53:02,521
You let go first.

988
00:53:02,521 --> 00:53:03,755
- You first.
- I said let go.

989
00:53:03,755 --> 00:53:05,057
Stop it.

990
00:53:05,057 --> 00:53:07,192
- I said let go.
- You first.

991
00:53:09,294 --> 00:53:12,631
Small world, right, Na Jeong?

992
00:53:12,631 --> 00:53:14,733
Yes, tell me about it.

993
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,002
How have you been all this time?

994
00:53:17,002 --> 00:53:19,705
I think I vaguely heard
you went to Yeonhee University.

995
00:53:19,705 --> 00:53:20,873
I did.

996
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:22,908
Are you married?

997
00:53:23,442 --> 00:53:24,176
Yes.

998
00:53:24,176 --> 00:53:25,143
Kids?

999
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:26,278
Two.

1000
00:53:26,612 --> 00:53:27,846
Daughters? Sons?

1001
00:53:28,146 --> 00:53:29,281
Two sons.

1002
00:53:32,251 --> 00:53:33,418
Are they well-behaved?

1003
00:53:34,052 --> 00:53:36,288
Boys tend to be rough on the house.

1004
00:53:37,189 --> 00:53:40,292
No. My kids are super calm.

1005
00:53:40,292 --> 00:53:42,961
The downstairs neighbor even asked
if we had kids at all.

1006
00:53:42,961 --> 00:53:44,696
"I thought you didn't have any kids."

1007
00:53:44,696 --> 00:53:46,498
They were shocked and even said this.

1008
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:54,773
Hey.

1009
00:53:55,007 --> 00:53:57,276
What kind of business did you do...

1010
00:53:57,276 --> 00:53:58,877
to get that rich?

1011
00:53:58,877 --> 00:54:01,313
I heard from the real estate agent
that you own three houses.

1012
00:54:01,313 --> 00:54:02,514
That's amazing.

1013
00:54:04,216 --> 00:54:07,252
I quit school in senior year...

1014
00:54:07,252 --> 00:54:08,720
and went to Australia to study.

1015
00:54:08,921 --> 00:54:11,990
When I came back to Korea,
I started working in Dongdaemun.

1016
00:54:11,990 --> 00:54:15,093
When the live-commerce era began,
it was like I'd found my wave.

1017
00:54:15,093 --> 00:54:16,562
I started selling clothes
through live streams,

1018
00:54:16,562 --> 00:54:19,198
expanded the business, and that took off.

1019
00:54:19,665 --> 00:54:20,532
Hey.

1020
00:54:20,732 --> 00:54:21,934
Hey.

1021
00:54:25,003 --> 00:54:27,039
Do you know what they call this?

1022
00:54:28,907 --> 00:54:31,109
Ladies, no other shop has this.

1023
00:54:31,109 --> 00:54:33,645
Look. If you order right now, I'll...

1024
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:35,881
A mobile show host.

1025
00:54:37,749 --> 00:54:40,152
They say life's full of downs and ups.

1026
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:44,056
But you know, I always had that in me.

1027
00:54:44,656 --> 00:54:47,826
The pioneering spirit
to take paths others wouldn't.

1028
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:49,862
The nerve and confidence...

1029
00:54:49,862 --> 00:54:52,898
to say "no" when others said "yes."

1030
00:54:56,768 --> 00:54:57,769
What about you?

1031
00:54:58,070 --> 00:54:59,705
Aren't you working?

1032
00:55:00,439 --> 00:55:01,306
No.

1033
00:55:02,107 --> 00:55:03,275
Right.

1034
00:55:03,275 --> 00:55:05,544
At our age, working's not easy.

1035
00:55:06,278 --> 00:55:08,380
That's true.

1036
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:09,381
My gosh.

1037
00:55:09,381 --> 00:55:11,517
Weren't you on JBN News recently?

1038
00:55:11,517 --> 00:55:13,552
Some fair for women
with career breaks or something.

1039
00:55:17,055 --> 00:55:19,091
You saw it.

1040
00:55:19,091 --> 00:55:20,259
Hey.

1041
00:55:20,526 --> 00:55:23,095
I thought, "Isn't that Cho Na Jeong?"
but wasn't sure.

1042
00:55:23,095 --> 00:55:24,162
But it was you.

1043
00:55:24,162 --> 00:55:26,131
The woman who said
she wanted to work again.

1044
00:55:31,503 --> 00:55:32,571
How'd she see that?

1045
00:55:33,438 --> 00:55:35,374
Hey, perfect timing.

1046
00:55:35,374 --> 00:55:37,142
You said you're looking for a job, right?

1047
00:55:37,142 --> 00:55:38,277
I actually need someone.

1048
00:55:38,277 --> 00:55:39,811
No, it's fine, Mi Sook.

1049
00:55:40,779 --> 00:55:41,947
Fine? What's fine?

1050
00:55:43,515 --> 00:55:45,083
Didn't you say you're job-hunting?

1051
00:55:45,083 --> 00:55:47,319
Does it hurt your pride to work under me?

1052
00:55:50,255 --> 00:55:52,224
You still have that way
of getting under people's skin.

1053
00:55:53,025 --> 00:55:56,628
Hey, you won't get anywhere
if you keep being so complacent.

1054
00:55:56,628 --> 00:55:58,030
No matter how successful you were before,

1055
00:55:58,030 --> 00:56:00,899
you're just a housewife
rotting away at home now.

1056
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:03,702
Honestly, women who only
raise kids at home...

1057
00:56:03,702 --> 00:56:05,437
don't even get chances like this.

1058
00:56:06,972 --> 00:56:09,641
This is why it's so hard
to talk to stay-at-home moms.

1059
00:56:09,641 --> 00:56:12,511
No, it's not that, Mi Sook.

1060
00:56:13,145 --> 00:56:16,081
I already got another offer
to work with someone else,

1061
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:17,583
that's why I can't.

1062
00:56:17,583 --> 00:56:19,318
Don't get me wrong.

1063
00:56:21,386 --> 00:56:24,990
I wasn't going to say this
because I didn't want to sound braggy.

1064
00:56:24,990 --> 00:56:27,626
It would be ridiculous to say this myself.

1065
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:31,063
But I used to be a show host too,
who pulled in 4,000 a minute.

1066
00:56:31,063 --> 00:56:33,665
So when my face popped up on TV,

1067
00:56:33,665 --> 00:56:37,102
my phone started blowing up
with calls from everywhere.

1068
00:56:37,102 --> 00:56:40,205
So I took a job offer.

1069
00:56:43,141 --> 00:56:43,942
Really?

1070
00:56:45,911 --> 00:56:46,745
From where?

1071
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:49,081
Sweet Home Shopping.

1072
00:56:51,683 --> 00:56:53,151
Sweet Home Shopping?

1073
00:57:06,899 --> 00:57:08,000
(2005
Na Jeong's Birthday 1)

1074
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,270
I decided I wouldn't live
like the other ladies.

1075
00:57:12,704 --> 00:57:14,673
Even when I grow up,

1076
00:57:15,574 --> 00:57:17,743
I'll never live like other wives.

1077
00:57:18,577 --> 00:57:19,344
Because...

1078
00:57:20,045 --> 00:57:21,647
I was born fabulous.

1079
00:57:23,248 --> 00:57:24,383
I'm young,

1080
00:57:25,117 --> 00:57:25,951
I'm strong,

1081
00:57:26,919 --> 00:57:28,854
and I'm living in the middle
of a grand adventure.

1082
00:57:30,556 --> 00:57:33,258
You can't live complaining all day.

1083
00:57:33,892 --> 00:57:34,760
Wait.

1084
00:57:37,429 --> 00:57:38,430
Naraeng.

1085
00:57:38,697 --> 00:57:39,431
Yes?

1086
00:57:40,065 --> 00:57:41,233
I think...

1087
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:44,002
maybe you should try again next time.

1088
00:57:46,071 --> 00:57:48,240
What do you mean, Director?

1089
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,209
If you go onstage like this now,

1090
00:57:50,209 --> 00:57:52,544
the other actors will chew us out alive.

1091
00:57:52,544 --> 00:57:54,446
I wasn't good enough.
Please give me another chance.

1092
00:57:54,446 --> 00:57:55,614
I can really pull this off.

1093
00:57:55,614 --> 00:57:58,250
How can you just fire me
without even a warning?

1094
00:57:58,250 --> 00:57:59,585
Everyone, come out now.

1095
00:57:59,585 --> 00:58:04,489
- I have to do this, please.
- <i>Happy birthday to you</i>

1096
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:09,127
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

1097
00:58:09,127 --> 00:58:13,632
<i>Happy birthday, dear Cho Naraeng</i>

1098
00:58:13,632 --> 00:58:16,902
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

1099
00:58:22,908 --> 00:58:24,343
Blow out the candles first.

1100
00:58:24,343 --> 00:58:25,777
One, two, three.

1101
00:58:31,517 --> 00:58:32,718
The final event.

1102
00:59:37,749 --> 00:59:39,685
(Don't call me ma'am)

1103
00:59:39,918 --> 00:59:41,520
I might become a total fraud.

1104
00:59:41,987 --> 00:59:43,922
Don't you want to go back
to Sweet Home Shopping?

1105
00:59:43,922 --> 00:59:45,357
Should I try applying there once more?

1106
00:59:45,357 --> 00:59:47,893
Why would you go there?
Who'd welcome you?

1107
00:59:47,893 --> 00:59:49,361
Do you not find me attractive anymore?

1108
00:59:49,361 --> 00:59:51,530
Sorry, but I feel sick.

1109
00:59:51,530 --> 00:59:52,598
Let's end this.

1110
00:59:53,832 --> 00:59:55,534
I must've been insane.

1111
00:59:55,534 --> 00:59:56,735
Totally insane.

1112
00:59:56,735 --> 00:59:58,670
I told you to apply somewhere else,
not Sweet Home Shopping.

1113
00:59:58,670 --> 01:00:01,173
Why exactly can't I apply there?

1114
01:00:01,373 --> 01:00:03,442
It seems the interview date got moved.

1115
01:00:04,009 --> 01:00:05,410
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

1116
01:00:05,410 --> 01:00:07,379
The competition's so fierce.

1117
01:00:08,046 --> 01:00:08,947
Jjon Na Jeong?

1118
01:00:12,651 --> 01:00:14,653
