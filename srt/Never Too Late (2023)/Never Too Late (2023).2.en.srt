00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,259
How many more?

5
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,180
You can leave after the last interview.

6
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,020
OK. Come on.

7
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,900
Hello, everyone.

8
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,820
My name is Wu Jingfang.

9
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,660
Wu Jingfang?

10
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,259
You're Wu Jingfang?

11
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,820
Yes, it's me.

12
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,500
Why would someone so old apply?

13
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,260
We forgot to write the age range

14
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,820
on our recruitment announcement.

15
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,660
Hello, Miss Wu.

16
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,660
Please introduce yourself first.

17
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:23,770
My name is Wu Jingfang.

18
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,820
I'm a local. I'm 60 years old.

19
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:28,980
I was in charge of the decoration of my two houses.

20
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:32,700
My goal is to be a furnishing designer.

21
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,980
You were in charge of the decoration of two houses.

22
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,700
How did you do it?

23
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,540
I communicated with the designer

24
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,060
to fit my ideas

25
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,540
in the design plan.

26
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,540
I also followed

27
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,060
the entire construction.

28
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,380
During the decoration,

29
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,380
most owners

30
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,420
will follow up like you.

31
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,100
You didn't make the blueprints.

32
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,980
You weren't involved in the construction.

33
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,060
How could you say

34
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,380
you were in charge of the decoration of two houses?

35
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:09,020
I participated in

36
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,580
communication, logistics, material selection, and supervision.

37
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,220
Isn't that being in charge?

38
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,090
Of course.

39
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:17,540
You're already better

40
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,090
than many owners.

41
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,500
But you have little to no experience

42
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:23,579
in the workplace.

43
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:24,820
May I ask

44
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,700
what did you do before?

45
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:28,700
When I was young,

46
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,850
I helped my husband with the leather business.

47
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,060
After the business stabilized,

48
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,380
I returned to my family

49
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,500
and took care of my family.

50
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,380
Then why did you choose to

51
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,100
intern at our company at such an age?

52
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,260
I want a real job.

53
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,380
I want to live independently

54
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,940
without relying on anyone.

55
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,340
To be honest,

56
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,810
before I came here,

57
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,260
I applied for many jobs.

58
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,060
They all told me

59
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,420
it's too late to find a job

60
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,940
at this age.

61
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,780
When I saw your company's recruitment plan

62
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,370
saying

63
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,140
you're recruiting from the whole society

64
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,820
those who love and want to learn design

65
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,220
without major

66
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,459
or age requirements,

67
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,089
I saw hope.

68
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:19,700
Good, good.

69
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,020
Does your family know

70
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,260
you want to come out to work?

71
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:26,820
At your age,

72
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:27,780
I'm afraid your children

73
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,340
won't allow you to come out to work, will they?

74
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,900
They support me.

75
00:04:33,659 --> 00:04:35,140
Let me put it another way.

76
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,460
For example, if we hired you,

77
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,130
what do you think is your advantage

78
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,340
over those young people outside?

79
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,220
I know I don't have

80
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,460
so many choices as young people.

81
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:46,820
So I think

82
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:50,020
I want this job more than them.

83
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,260
Naturally,

84
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,460
I will also put in

85
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:55,220
more efforts, sincerity and patience.

86
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,140
And

87
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:58,780
I have enough curiosity

88
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,220
in this industry.

89
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,370
Okay, thank you for your answers.

90
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,780

Do you have someone you like?

94
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,020
Zhao Xue.

95
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,260
Xu Yuan.

96
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,220
Zhang Zhenhui.

97
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,140
These three

98
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,540
are outstanding in both professionality and personality.

99
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,460
Zhao Xue

100
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:29,380
is very thoughtful.

101
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,020
I choose Zhao Xue and Zhang Zhenhui.

102
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,340
Don't you think

103
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,820
Wu Jingfang is also good?

104
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,020
Ms. Wu is quite interesting.

105
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,340
I vote for her.

106
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:47,460
I think we can give the elderly a chance.

107
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:48,980
I second.

108
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,230
OK. Count me in.

109
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,900
Now Zhao Xue has four votes.

110
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,659
Zhang Zhenhui got three votes.

111
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,900
Wu Jingfang got three votes.

112
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,020
But we only have two spots.

113
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,690
Let's make the final choice.

114
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,220
I choose Zhang Zhenhui.

115
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,580
This is not a nursing home.

116
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:08,140

In overall consideration...

119
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,020
Zhang Zhenhui.

120
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:20,380
It's still a tie.

121
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,020
Well, we should place quality above quantity.

122
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,820
Send Zhao Xue an offer first.

123
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,140
Thank you.

124
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,340
You're welcome.

125

Ms. Wu, it's very brave of you

126
00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:53,220
to apply for an intern in Litong.

127
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:55,820
I hope

128
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,460
I could be more bold.

Will I be accepted?

132

You rented my house

133

and then came to my company for an interview.

134
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,140
It's really ridiculous. I don't get it.

135

What's so difficult to get?

136

You don't need to rent a house.

141
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:30,660
I can save half of the rent.

142
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,540
It's a win-win situation.

143

You weren't home every time.

175
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,460

177
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,220
How is your dad?

178
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,340
Is he still a chef in Wujiang?

179
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,620
Yes. He's good.

180
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,940
How good could he be?

181
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,220
In my opinion,

182
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,420
you have to bring your dad back from Wujiang.

183
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:42,740
He's not young anymore.

184

It'll be better for him

185
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,100
to stay with you.

186
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,220
Why did your dad

187
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,740
suddenly rent

188
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,740
the house out?

189
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,460
Tian, tell me.

190
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,940
I won't tell anyone.

191
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:03,220
Is the tenant

192
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:07,100
your dad's girlfriend?

193
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:10,980
That's impossible.

194
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,100
Aunt Ding, what are you thinking?

195
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,060
I'm just asking.

196
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,970
Why are you angry?

197
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,220

198
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:24,340
Okay.

199
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,220

Look.

201
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,180
You're the same age as me?

202
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,220
You're not young anymore.

203
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,300
Why did you still rent a house and live alone?

204
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,700
Can your children be rest assured?

205
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,500
Why didn't you fill this out?

I don't know how to fill it.

207

210
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,340
Is it inconvenient?

211
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,620
Is it because Tian is here?

212
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,220
Jiang said she was a tenant.

213
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,420
If you're married,

214
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,500
I'll fill it in for you.

Have you got the marriage certificate?

I'll fill "married" in for you.

231

If you don't have certificates,

232
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,460
I'll fill "single" in for you.

233

What's the big deal?

234

If you don't even know

00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,860
such a simple thing,

236
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,220
does it mean you have another family

What are you talking about?

I'm in the process of divorcing my husband.

240

We're in the cooling-off period.

No, nothing.

246

No need.

I ordered takeout.

253
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,460
It's not healthy.

254
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,180
I only have to cook more noodles.

255

We're not that close.

259

So if you want to eat or do anything,

260
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,100
you don't have to share with me.

261

264

an 60-year-old intern?

393
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,860
The purpose of our Plan Zero

394
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,700
is to recruit talents

395
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:20,700

00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,620

what she likes at this age.

And I believe Ms. Wu's story

402
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:35,140
will motivate everyone here.

I really didn't want you to teach her design.

00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:53,980
Don't make it hard for her.

517
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,180
Let me help you.

518
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,260
Wu, not bad.

519
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:00,660
Wu, I did the right thing hiring you.

520
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:01,740
I have to take you with me

521
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,660
to business receptions.

522
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,220
Let's have another drink.

523
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,420
Welcome.

524
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:06,660
Thank you, Mr. Liu.

525
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,460
Good drinker. Come on.

526
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,220
Ms. Wu,

527
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,900
you don't look 60.

528
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:16,180
Can you share your secret to stay young?

529
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,300
Let's talk later.

[Fang Yuanqing]
[I'm at a company dinner. I want to run away.]

531
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,450
I'm at a company dinner.

532
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,740
I want to run away.

533

[Let me give you a tip. If you think of them as animals, you won't feel annoyed.]

534
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:30,980
Let me give you a tip.

535
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:33,170
If you think of them as animals,

536
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,900
you won't feel annoyed.

537
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:40,700
Here.

538
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:43,380
Cheers! Cheers!

539
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:47,380
It's delicious.

540
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:51,860
Here.

541
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,020
Come on. Cheers.

542

545

Ms. Jiang.

546
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,980
Are you feeling unwell?

547
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,460
No.

548
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:09,380
I need to use the bathroom.

549
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,460
Look at me.

550
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,300
Mr. Liu,

551
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:14,420
I should toast to you.

552
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:17,020
Thank you for taking care of me.

553
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:19,980
Do you know why

554
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:20,980
I took care of you?

555
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:23,260
Why?

556
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:25,860
Because you've been doing well for a while.

557
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,460
Then I'll continue to work hard.

558
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:28,980
I'll drink it up. Drink as much as you want.

559
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,780
If you continue to do well,

560
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,500
I'll keep taking care of you.

561
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:39,940
Mr. Liu.

562
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,460
I have a question.

563
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:44,180
How did Jiang Tian suddenly

564
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,500
come to our company as a chief designer?

565
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,930
It's not sudden.

566
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:48,860
She was demoted.

567
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:52,660
It's okay.

568
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:54,500
Let's drink.

569
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,740
Jiang Tian was demoted.

570
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:58,860
Demoted?

571
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,300
What happened?

572
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,780
Manager, what happened?

573
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,140
It's nothing.

574
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,540
Jiang Tian did nothing wrong.

575
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,660
In our line of work,

576
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,770
it is an unspoken rule

577
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,740
to eat kickbacks on materials, right?

578
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,700
But Jiang Tian told

579
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,180
the home owner about it.

580
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:25,420
The owner went to her boss.

581
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,260
The boss lost his face.

582
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:30,460
Then he had to send Jiang Tian to our branch

583
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,220
to act as a chief designer.

584
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,140
That's what happened.

585
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,060
Got it?

586
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:38,660
I think she did nothing wrong.

587
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,660
Because we can't take unscrupulous money.

588
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,780
Ms. Jiang, you are back.

589
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,660
Jiang Tian, come here.

590
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,740
You're back. Here.

591
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,700
The second toast. Come on. Pour it for me.

592
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:49,020
This toast

593

not only welcomes our interns,

594

but also Jiang Tian to our company.

595
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:54,980
Come on.

596
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:56,260
I hope Jiang Tian

597
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,700
can bring good performance to our company.

I'm the manager.

Why don't you come and toast to me?

607
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:25,740
This is ridiculous.

608
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:29,220
Mr. Liu, just take care of me.

609
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,220
Here, Ms. Jiang.

Here's to you.

611
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,180
I just finished it. You...

Let's drink together, Mr. Liu.

613
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:39,460
Okay, are you proposing a toast to Ms. Hu or me.

614
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:41,620
You're drinking to me too?

615
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,740
Not to the HR manager?

616

I'm fine, Wu. I'm really fine.

OK. You can come with me.

It's a coincidence.

This is my roommate, Jiang.

Isn't he handsome?

She's drunk.

640

What about you?

What about you?

I'll take a taxi.

Help me.

645

I can't handle her alone.

646

Let's go together.

647
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:27,060
When did you become so good at drinking?

648
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,460
It's a necessary skill

649
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,180
of office workers.

650
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:17,500
Thank you.

651
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,780
I know you don't like my aunt staying here.

652
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,700
But if there's any problem,

653
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:27,940
don't make it difficult for my aunt.

654
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,300
You can come to me.

655
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:32,980
I make it difficult for her?

656
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,410
Is that what you think of me?

657
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,700
It's been so many years.

658
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:43,220
Why are you still so poor at reading?

659
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,260
I mean...

660
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:45,260
You shouldn't have said it.

661
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,220
You know I shouldn't have said it,

662
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,450
but you still argue with me.

663
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,420
Don't worry.

664
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:53,740
I have a smooth communication with your aunt.

665
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:55,940
At least I don't need you

666
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,530
to help her solve the problem.

667
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,260
Let's not

668
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,300
see each other often.

669

Ms. Wu.

670
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:26,740
Did you just get here?

671
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,700
Yes, I'm sorry. I overslept.

672
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,620
Ms. Wu, if you're late three times,

673
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,420
20% of your salary will be deducted.

674
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,660
Got it.

675
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:38,460
Jiang, why didn't you wake me up?

676
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,860
My alarm didn't go off.

677
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,220
I have a bad temper.

678
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:43,300
I don't want to irritate you.

679
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,060
Ms. Jiang.

680
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,260
Are you free?

681
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,460
Great.

682
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,220
I have a job.

683
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,220
A client needs to measure the house.

684
00:33:58,460 --> 00:33:59,900
But I'm too busy to leave now.

685
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,580
Can you go there for me?

686
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:03,980
No problem.

687
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,140

690
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:11,580
Thank you.

691
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:41,940
Ms. Jiang, did you forget something?

692
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:46,540
What?

693
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,100
Me?

694
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:52,020
I'm sober now.

695
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:56,179
Have you done the homework I gave you yesterday?

696
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:57,100
Don't worry.

697
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:59,540
I'll make time to finish it today.

698
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:02,180
Measuring the house is a great learning opportunity.

699
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:03,820
How can I miss it?

700
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:09,900
Can you drive?

701
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:12,020
No.

702
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:15,740
If you can't drive,

703
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,260
why did you buy a car?

704
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:20,180
I've registered at the driving school.

705
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:22,100
I'll drive someday.

706
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,380
You're the most confident person I've ever met.

707
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:34,780
No one is optimistic about what I do now.

708
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:37,380
If I'm not confident,

709
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,340
I don't think I can go on.

710
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,580
I envy you.

711
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,130
You found what you like to do

712
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:45,340
at the best age.

713
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,900
How do you know

714
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:48,980
we like what we do?

715
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:51,420
I don't know about others.

716
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,260
At least you do.

717
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:54,620
Look.

718
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,460
When you talk about design with others,

719
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,460
you eyes light up.

720
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:03,580
Ms. Wu,

721
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:05,900
let me tell you the truth.

722
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,340
I was transferred here from Beijing

723
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,980
because I was in the way of others' money.

724
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,140
The leader of the branch are of course aware of

725
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,140
this kind of thing.

726
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,620
Although I'm a chief designer,

727
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,660
I can't get any projects.

728
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:18,620
So,

729
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,300
as my intern,

730
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,740
you don't have much to do.

731
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:25,620
It's better to find another mentor.

732
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,940
Why wait for the company to give you a job?

733
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,410
We can find it ourselves.

734
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:31,780
When we find a project,

735
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,570
will the company give up the opportunity to make money

736
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:34,980
and stop us from doing it?

737
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,460
Looking for projects isn't picking up leaves.

738
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,380
It's not that easy.

739
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:47,620
You won't know until you try.

742
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:09,420
Ms. Jiang, you're amazing.

743
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,540
You can draw a floor plan

744
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,460
with a casual look.

745
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:16,940
This is an essential skill for a designer.

746
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:19,580
And I'm not just looking casually.

747
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:31,620
Ms. Jiang, let me write it down for you.

748
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:32,980
No, I can do it myself.

749
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:35,420
It's convenient and fast.

750
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,500
You just tell me the number.

751
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:38,180

Go back first.

756
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,260
I'll return the car to the company.

757
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,460
I'll wait for you.

758
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:11,980
I'll be late.

759
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:12,940
You don't have to wait for me.

Where is Ms. Hu?

761
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,620
She was needed at her daughter's school.

762
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:54,540
She went out.

763
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,460
These are the measurements

764
00:38:57,730 --> 00:38:58,900
and two set of keys.

765

I even need to report to him about grocery shopping.

840
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:35,380
Because I can't drive.

841
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:36,580
I have to go out

842
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:38,140
every time he goes out.

843
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:39,820
I

844
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:41,140
want to live a new life.

845
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,140
Rent a house,

846
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:44,780
buy a car, learn to drive,

847
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:46,740
and find a job.

848
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:49,380
I want to see how far I can go.

It's even hard for young people to find a job now.

851
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:54,980
You're not young anymore.

852
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:57,180
Where are you going to find a job?

853

00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:09,340
Don't worry.

859
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:11,900
I will find a decent job.

860
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:13,940
I swear.

861
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:18,340
Okay, promise me.

862
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:21,140
One month.

863
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,300
If you can find a proper job in a month,

864
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:25,300
I'll stop nagging.

865
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:26,540
If you can't,

866
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:29,620
we have to face the reality.
