[Episode 3]

4
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,100
Sis, come on.

5
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:38,259
Rest assured,

6
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,020
I will find a decent job.

7
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,100
I swear.

8
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,620
Fine, promise me.

9
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:50,380
One month.

10
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,180
You have to find a proper job

11
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,660
within a month.

12
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,740
Otherwise,

13
00:01:57,259 --> 00:01:58,729
we have to face reality.

14
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,140
Sis.

15
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,530
Your son is here.

16
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:03,860
I have to go.

17
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,820
So you're living with

18
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:15,770
an old lady,

19
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,700
and she is your intern.

20
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,820
If you hadn't told me that,

21
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:23,420
I would think

22
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,260
I was listening to an urban legend story.

23
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:27,380
Now you know

24
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:29,940
why I came to you so late.

25
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,820
It's really a mess.

26
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,140
What are you going to do now?

27
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,700
I still want to persuade the old lady to move out.

28
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,260
She gets up at four or five every morning.

29
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,540
If it keeps going on like this,

30
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,420
I'll have a nervous breakdown sooner or later.

31
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,810
But she's not from here.

32
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,660
She finally moved to the city.

33
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,260
I can't just ask her to move out.

34
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,100
I really don't have the heart

35
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,500
to do it.

36
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,260
You can live with me.

37
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,820
I'll clean up my study for you

38
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:57,980
and put a bed in there.

39
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,140
Live with you?

40
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,540
I'll be watched by your parents everyday.

41
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,660
And I must go to bed at ten.

42
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,660
I can't stand it.

43
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,500
Then

44
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,980
we can just rent an apartment.

45
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:08,660
A two-bedroom.

46
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:09,860
Are you serious?

47
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,860
My mom will never allow it.

48
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,100
You don't have to move out for me.

49
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,820
It's comfortable to live in your own home.

50
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:19,940
You have everything.

51
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:21,380
Now you're back,

52
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,820
what about your boyfriend?

53
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:25,060
What about him?

54
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,660
I'll just fly to Beijing on weekends

55
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,250
when he's available.

56
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,980
We've been together for all these years.

57
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,260
We'll survive this year.

58
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,420
It's better if you can't make it.

59
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:34,660
In my heart,

60
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,860
you and Zhou are the perfect match.

61
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,260
What?

62
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,100
Ask yourself,

63
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:47,370
how does it feel to meet your first love?

64
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,980
Does it remind you of the moments that made you flip?

65
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,380
Just kidding.

66
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,940
There's nothing like hatred

67
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,100
when it comes to young love.

68
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,700
Besides, you can still be friends

69
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,380
after getting used to it.

70
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,940
You're not like me.

71
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,220
After I divorced my ex-husband…

72
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,340
I heard that he has a girlfriend now.

73
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,260
If we meet now,

74
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,140
it'll be really awkward.

75
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:19,140
Stop thinking about the past.

76
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,779
We need to move on.

77
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:22,700
Let's go.

78
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,460
Auntie, if there is a better house,

79
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,659
would you like to move?

80
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,780
Why are you bringing this up all of a sudden?

81
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,580
I'm afraid that

82
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,340
you don't feel comfortable living with someone else.

83
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,340
I'm more comfortable than her.

84
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:47,820
I trust my first impression.

85
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:50,580
I liked this house at first sight.

86
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:52,820
I don't want to move.

87
00:04:54,659 --> 00:04:56,780
Why don't you come live with me?

88
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,700
No one lives above me.

89
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,100
Why waste your money?

90
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,700
Do you feel lonely?

91
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,140
Boy,

92
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,700
your parents got divorced a long time ago.

93
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,340
They're both having a new life.

94
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:12,020
Why are you still here?

95
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,780
I'm afraid she'll give you a hard time.

96
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,900
She doesn't look nice.

97
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:19,580
I think

98
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,580
you are afraid of Jiang.

99
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,100
Am I right?

100
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,100
Look.

101
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,140
You came here at this time just to avoid her.

102
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,780
No, why should I be afraid of her?

103
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:29,980
I'm just afraid that

104
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,370
if you feel uncomfortable, my mom will…

105
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:33,100
Don't worry. I have you.

106
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,780
No one dares to pick on me.

107
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,130
Fine.

108
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,450
Here we are.

109
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,659
You're not coming to my place?

110
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:50,900
It's already ten.

111
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,659
My mom is going to blow up my phone soon.

112
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,730
[Incoming Mom]

113
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,020
Drive safe.

114
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,340
If you need anything,

115
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,020
let me know anytime.

116
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,460
Text me when you're home.

117
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,380
Bye.

118
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:13,700
Be careful.

119
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,660
Jiang, you’re back.

120
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,340
Aunt Wu,

121
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,700
have you finished the job I gave you today

122
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:32,900
in the company?

123
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,020
Yes.

124
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:36,900
Do you have time?

125
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,220
I'll report to you.

126
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,020
Okay.

127
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,020
Okay.

128
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,700
The first one is an elegant one-bedroom apartment.

129
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,020
Modern style, light and airy,

130
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,140
north-south layout.

131
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:01,900
Its disadvantage is

132
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,660
the lack of storage space.

133
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,100
The second one

134
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,660
is a large two-bedroom. It's spacious.

135
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,140
But the windows are too small.

136
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,900
The lighting and ventilation may have problems.

137
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,460
The third one

138
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,460
looks similar to Court 33.

139
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,380
Is it on the Alley Street right here?

140
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,260
Double bedroom, both south-facing.

141
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,020
A storage room in the yard.

142
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,460
Proper layout.

143
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,540
Most importantly, it has a balcony and a yard.

144
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,700
Everything is perfect.

145
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,580
You like the third one.

146
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,700
Good taste.

147
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:33,980
The third one

148
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,580
has just been renovated.

149
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,380
The wiring, plumbing, waterproof coating,

150
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,530
floor, furniture, all new.

151
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,460
It's move-in ready.

152
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,780
You can even tell these?

153
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:45,260
Of course.

154
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,140
I've been to all three places myself.

155
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,100
I took all the photos.

156
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,340
You went in person

157
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,900
for my little homework.

158
00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:55,540
I don't mind a little trouble,

159
00:07:55,659 --> 00:07:57,380
as long as you can live comfortably.

160
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,330
Now you like the third house,

161
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,140
you should pick a time and move there.

162
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,220
By the way,

163
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,260
the third house

164
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,140
has a clock

165
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,020
just like this.

166
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,820
You will love it.

167
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,460
Jiang, Jiang.

168
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:15,980
The…

169
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,580
The third house

170
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,340
has a very serious problem.

171
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,700
I forgot to tell you.

172
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,700
The kitchen is diagonally across

173
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,220
from the storage room.

174
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:27,060
It's a taboo in Feng Shui.

00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,460
She has her own work to do.

345
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,020
She doesn't have time to glue the tickets for you.

346
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,980
We're having a case?

347
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:34,700
Of course.

348
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,140
But I know nothing.

349
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,540
B & B?

350
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,780
It's so exciting.

351
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,060
It's my case.

352
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:47,660
It has nothing to do with you.

353
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,380
Why?

354
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,980
I'm your assistant.

355
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,140
Do you know how to draw?

356
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,460
Do you know how to measure the size?

357
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,060
Do you know about how to use CAD?

358
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,300
I can learn.

359
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,140
We only have one week.

360
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,860
Even if I teach you,

361
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,660
do you think you can learn?

362
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,980
Aunt Wu, I just joined this company.

363
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:12,780
You know how much this case means to me,

364
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,980
right?

365
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,300
I only have this one chance.

366
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,220
I can only succeed, not fail.

367
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,300
You'll watch this time

368
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,740
and learn about the process of drawing.

369
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,500
You'll learn something.

370
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,460
Okay?

371
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,220
Don’t worry, Jiang.

372
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,500
I won’t hold you back.

373
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,780
What can I do for you?

374
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,900
Help me communicate with Mr. Qian's

375
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,180
hotel manager.

376
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,620
Okay.

377
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:36,940
I didn't expect that

378
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,900
Jiang Tian would take this case.

379
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,540
She just came back from Beijing

380
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:41,660
and joined the company.

381
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:42,780
Of course she needs a case

382
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:43,860
to gain a firm foothold.

383
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,020
Is she capable?

384
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:47,980
She was transferred from the headquarters.

385
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,460
She has to be capable, I think.

386
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,140
It doesn't matter.

387
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,980
The mighty dragon is not match for the native serpent.

388
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,260
I think Hu Dexiang is better.

389
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,380
Is Ms. Hu that good?

390
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,140
You'll see.

391
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,700
Ms. Wu.

392
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,700
The phone number of the hotel manager?

393
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:06,980
Okay.

394
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:08,300
I'll text you later.

395
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,300
Okay. Bye.

396
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,700
Stop spinning the pen.

397
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,140
I'm asking you about the budget.

398
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,260
Two million, one million, half a million.

399
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,420
Tell me.

400
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:21,060
How much is their budget? I'll come up with a plan.

401
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,140
Ms. Hu,

402
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:22,980
I've found

403
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,300
the information you asked for.

404
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,500
Keep an eye on them. Don't just say, "Okay."

405
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,660
Make calls to rush them. Keep an eye on it.

406
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,460
Okay.

407
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,690
After I found the information,

408
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,220
I ran into Ms. Jiang's intern.

409
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,980
I think they have contacted the hotel manager.

410
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,410
I was curious, so I eavesdropped.

411
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:41,220
That's why I'm a little late.

412
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,460
It won't happen again.

413
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,900
We don't do things this way.

414
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,780
Usually when we get the competition task,

415
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,300
we do things the same way.

416
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:50,900
No one will go to the client.

417
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:54,060
Ms. Hu, is she cheating?

418
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,780
It's not that serious.

419
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:58,380
She's new here. She has her habits.

420
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,500
We just do what we do.

421
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,300
Okay?

422
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:05,020
Should we contact them too?

423
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:06,660
Well,

424
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,460
we'll take the plan

425
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,020
I just told you about.

426
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,780
You finish the design plan.

427
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:13,860
Give it to me before you go home.

428
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,300
Zhao Xue, help them.

429
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,700
Do as they say.

430
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:17,540
Okay.

431
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,540
What are you waiting for?

432
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,420
Move.

433
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,780
We have an annual review.

434
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,500
Don't you want your bonus?

435
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,700
Seize the initiative.

436
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,220
You're not doing it.

437
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,940
Mr. Qian, it's me.

438
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,860
Hu Dexiang.

439
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,460
Call me Hu.

442
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,700
It's okay. Nothing a drink can't fix.

443
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,220
I'll take care of it, okay?

444
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,260
Okay?

445
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,620
That's it. Bye.

446
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,220
I'm sorry.

447
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,420
When I contacted Mr. Qian,

448
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,740
I heard you also contacted him

449
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,020
and you were meeting today.

450
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,900
I thought we should all meet together.

451
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,210
We're from the same company.

452
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,780
Mr. Qian is our client.

453
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,740
We can't make our client come twice.

454
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,660
Ms. Jiang, you don’t mind, do you?

455
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,140
It's okay.

456
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:28,740
Let's get started.

457
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:29,700
Okay.

458
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,700
According to the information we have here,

459
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,660
you don't want a traditional hotel,

460
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,180
you want a high-end B & B?

461
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:37,940
Yes.

462
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,780
I just bought several two-story buildings

463
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:41,980
in the old town.

464
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,300
I want to build a high-end B & B.

465
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,500
Lu's Mansion is nearby.

466
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,220
Do you know it?

467
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,020
A famous salt merchant in the Qing Dynasty.

468
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,860
I like the culture there,

469
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,780
so I paid good money for it.

470
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:56,700
The old town is great. Really good.

471
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,620
If you want to open a B & B in the old town,

472
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,780
we can add something

473
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:02,380
related to the local culture.

474
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:03,980
What a coincidence! Here.

475
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:05,980
See, when I came here earlier,

476

[Ancient style hotel, Preliminary Concept Design Plan]

477
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,500
my assistant made

478
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,700
a preliminary concept design plan.

479
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,700
Take a look.

480
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,660
It's quite similar to your idea.

481
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,220
You're very thoughtful.

482
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,220
She came prepared. So thoughtful.

483
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,020
Look.

484
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:19,620
The structural layers of this house.

485
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,970
There is a grove of bamboo.

486
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:21,660
So,

487
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,660
we can do a little ancient style.

488
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:24,780
It's good.

489
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:28,460
Not bad.

490
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,700
But it's a bit general.

491
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,220
This is the preliminary plan.

492
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,740
You have the final say.

493
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,060
Please give us more suggestions.

494
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,700
Speaking of suggestions, I do have a few.

495
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:41,460
I think this folk style

496
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:42,540
is good,

497
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,660
but we're talking about several buildings.

498
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,220
They don't have to be the same style.

499
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,660
We can have more.

500
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,860
The customers will have more choices.

501
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,980

I've noticed that the industrial style

is popular on the Internet.

505
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:58,900
We'll have a bar or a restaurant, something like that.

506
00:23:59,140 --> 00:23:59,980
Okay?

507
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,460
Ms. Jiang, what do you mean?

508
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,460
I'll be frank then.

509
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,540
Go ahead.

510
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,460
I don't think it's suitable.

511
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,420
The Waterhouse at South Bund

512
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,460
is located on the Bund.

513
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:22,220
The style

514
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,210
matches its big environment.

515
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,700
But the locations of our buildings

516
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,500
are not suitable for this style.

517
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,780
I think Suzhou Garden style

518
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,260
is more suitable.

519
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,020
Can't I have them all?

520
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,980
On the outside, Ma Tau wallwatts and small grey tiles.

521
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,260
On the inside, modern industrial style.

522
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,460
So special,

523
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:40,980
isn't it?

524
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:45,980
Sometimes, mixing everything together

525
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,700
doesn't make it special.

526
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,500
It's more likely to be grotesque.

527
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:52,370
And, hotels like the Waterhouse at South Bund

528
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,020
are expensive to build.

529
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:55,140
Our buildings

530
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,860
are hard to renovate already.

531
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,980
Here, this wall.

532
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,860
We have a lot of walls like this.

533
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:01,980
Beneath these walls,

534
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,900
there's most likely extensive mildew.

535
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:06,020
I'll have to remove the outer layers of the walls

536
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,300
and check the wiring and the plumbing.

537
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,220
Enough.

538
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:09,500
You don't have to tell me so many professional things.

539
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,700
I don't understand.

540
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,380
Ms. Jiang is mainly considering

541
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,380
the cost.

542
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,380
Money is not a problem.

543
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,940
Okay, industrial style, pass.

544
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:19,980
We'll have something else.

545
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,740
Do what you do.

546
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,500
Just give me a number.

547
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,300
As a designer,

548
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,940
I'm willing to provide my clients

549
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,980
a professional and economical plan.

550
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,780
Although you're willing to spend money,

551
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:36,220
I don't want you to spend the wrong money.

552
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:38,700
Actually, I know.

553
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:39,940
I can just do

554
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,530
whatever you want.

555
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:42,940
That's the easiest.

556
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:44,890
But it doesn't mean

557
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,860
we will have a good result.

558
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,980
Helping the clients rule out unrealistic ideas

559
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:52,140
and finding the best design with the clients,

560
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:54,700
are the basis of a good work.

561
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,500
You came to us

562
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:57,980
because you want

563
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,420
a good design.

564
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,660
Jiang, I’m not blaming you.

565
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,460
But…

566
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,780
How can you talk to a client like this?

567
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,700
He's the employer.

568
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,980
We are the contractor.

00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,460
We serve.

570
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,460
What did you do?

571
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:21,780
You contradicted everything he said.

572
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:22,980
If I were Mr. Qian,

573
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:24,220
I'd be mad too.

574
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,380
But I was telling the truth.

575
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,900
Who else could point out his unrealistic ideas

576
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:31,060
other than the designer?

577
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,180
You could've done it a different way.

578
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:34,620
Did you have to be that direct?

579
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,540
No matter how good a lie is,

580
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,860
it's still a lie.

581
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,220
Honest advice may be unpleasant to hear, but it's the truth.

582
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,460
Truth can be said nicely.

583
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:45,060
Who says truth must be harsh?

584
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:48,130
Jiang, you are a nice person,

585
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:49,940
but you always offend people.

586
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:52,140
No wonder you're targeted all the time.

587
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:56,620
I didn't…

588
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,540
I didn't mean that.

589
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:58,740
You're right.

00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,060

I'm not criticizing you.

Stop following me.

But we live together.

00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:28,060
asked me to help him cheat, I refused.

688
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,700
I always helped other classmates

689
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,220
when they needed my help.

690
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,500
You remember things about Zhou Yewen so well.

691
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,700
He's indeed your first love.

692
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:39,700
Honey,

693
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:41,500
when people get to know you well, they'll find you

694
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,380
to be really nice.

695
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,780
But the problem is

696
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,420
no one gets to know you well.

697
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,460
There's you.

698
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,210
Me?

699
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:54,220
I'm the exception.

700
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,460
It's all because

701
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,900
I sprained my ankle on the first day of primary school,

702
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,220
and you happened to sit next to me.

703
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,620
The teacher asked you to take care of me.

704
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:04,220
And we went to the same primary school, middle school, and high school.

705
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:06,540
We were always in the same class.

706
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,940
That's why I am

707
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:11,780
super stable now.

708
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,300
And there's Zhou Yewen.

709
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,300
Zhou Yewen.

710
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,660
Even if you are my only friend,

711
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:20,940
it doesn't matter.

712
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,700
The quantity is not important.

713
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:24,020
What matters most it the quality.

714
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,060
Besides, I have

715
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,980
a few colleagues I can get along with in Beijing.

716
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:29,450
That's enough.

717
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,540
What are you going to do

718
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:35,060
this year in Suzhou?

719
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:36,700
Are you still fighting alone?

720
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:40,500
I'll let it be.

721
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,500
I came back here to be a chief designer.

722
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:46,380
If I can't find a right partner,

723
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,980
I'll do it myself.

724
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,380
Aunt Wu.

725
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:55,460
Her?

726
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,500
She knows nothing.

727
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,900
She makes no difference.

728
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:03,420
You can teach her what she doesn't know.

729
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:05,980
And she's the aunt of your first love.

730
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,620
She didn't help this time.

731
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:09,420
Maybe next time she will.

732
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,980
I might as well teach you.

733
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,620
To be honest,

734
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:16,460
you always say you don't want to work in the bank.

735
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:17,620
Why don't I recommend you

736
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,620
to join our company's Zero Project.

737
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,140
You can just change your job.

738
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:22,980
How is it going?

739
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,260
Are you done?

740
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,140
Should I bring more?

741
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,620
No, there's plenty.

742
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:32,180
You took so much time and made only these?

743
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,300
You are so slow.

744
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,300
Your aunt is waiting.

745
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,660
There are so many more outside.

746
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:36,980
Mom, that's all.

747
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,380
Take them out first.

748
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,660
My cousin is getting married, not me.

749
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:41,700
Besides,

750
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,260
I asked Jiang Tian to come here and help,

751
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:44,660
that's pretty good.

752
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:45,900
You, married?

753
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,860
If you get married, I'll be ecstatic.

754
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,660
Are you aware of your own situation?

755
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,700
When can you get married again?

756
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,140
Get married?

757
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:55,540
Jiang,

758
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,460
do you have a boyfriend?

759
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,300
He's in Beijing.

760
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:05,460
Beijing? A long-distance relationship?

761
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,700
My goodness, that's unstable.

762
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,700
I remember you're one year older than Xiaoxiao.

763
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:10,420
Let me tell you.

764
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,860
Love marathons are no good.

765
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:12,980
Break-ups are almost inevitable.

766
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:13,940
Alright, mom.

767
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:14,860
That's enough.

768
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:15,940
Got it.

769
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:17,460
Hurry up. I'll leave you to it.

770
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:18,460
Thank you.

771
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:19,420
It's okay, auntie.

772
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:20,660
Hurry up.

773
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,220
You are too slow.

774
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,260
I'm sorry.

775
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:24,860
That's how my mom is.

776
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:26,860
Please forgive her.

777
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,180
It's okay.

Interior design

779
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,460
is a part of

780
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,780
architecture and environment design.

781
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,420
In the process of building development,

782
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:39,140
there used to be no such thing

783
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,220
as an interior designer.

784
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:41,940
All the environment designs

785
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:44,140
were accomplished by architects.

[Basic course for interior designers to conclude contracts]

787
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,300
With the development of society

788
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,460
and the improvement of human living standards

789
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,740
and production technology,

790
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,220
which led to the expansion of the market,

791
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:52,980
the interior design industry

792
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:55,220
arose.

793
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,260
Interior design can be broadly devided…

794
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,620
Now, many large factories…

795
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,460
You're back.

796
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,460
Great. Wash your hands and come eat.

797
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,980
The development of the Internet technologies

798
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:16,980
also helps.

Industrial design and interior design

801
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,100
are very simple

802
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:20,780
for professionals.

803
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:21,580
Aunt Wu,

804
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,179
what are you listening to?

805
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,380
I found it online.

806
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,820
Lectures about interior design.

807
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:29,060
People's needs for the environment

808
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:30,130
will change.

809
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,100
But ordinary people

810
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,380
can only...

811
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,820
I advise you not to listen.

812
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,739
Not all interior designs are easier than industrial designs.

813
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:39,460
Some of the old foreign-style houses and old houses with a courtyard

814
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,940
are troublesome to renovate.

815
00:34:41,739 --> 00:34:42,780
If you keep listening to those,

816
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,820
I'm afraid you'll be misguided.

817
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,620
Really?

818
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,780
I think it's good.

819
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,020
Choose what's necessary.

820
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,610
Focus on design.

821
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,380
Customers come first.

822
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,540
Come out soon.

823
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:56,540
Now,

824
00:34:56,659 --> 00:34:58,180
I'll make some examples.

825
00:34:58,940 --> 00:34:59,900
No, thanks.

826
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,340
Don't be shy.

827
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,580
I made a few more dishes today.

828
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:04,980
Try them.

829
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:07,740
It's really okay.

00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:09,820
Are you afraid my cooking isn't good?

831
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,100
No way.

832
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:12,860
I'm good at cooking.

833
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:14,740
I don't mean that.

834
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:16,980
I just don't eat spicy food.

835
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,340
I'm so forgetful.

836
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,460
There're wontons. From Chen's.

837
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,620
I didn't eat spicy food either.

838
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:31,020
Then I moved to Sichuan

839
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,530
and got used to it.

840
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,580
You should try.

841
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,620
It's delicious and exciting.

842
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,860
The spiciness will make your snot and tears come out.

843

All your troubles will be gone.

Jiang.

845
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:48,900
What are you thinking?

846
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:50,580
Nothing.

What do you think you can do now?

849
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:06,980
I can do anything.

850
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:15,900
Do you have any idea about the hotel?

851
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:17,500
Yes.

852
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:18,900
I told you.

Ancient style.

854

The rooftop is not suitable for a bar.

855

00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:25,380
for a tea house.

857
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,260
Will Mr. Qian agree?

858

00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:31,780
and diversity.

860
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,460
As long as my design

861
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:35,500
meet these two requirements, it's fine.

862
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:41,340
What do you think I can do for you?

863
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,140
Aunt Wu,

864
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,260
I remember you said

865
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,900
you were a businesswoman, right?

866
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,260
Yes, selling leather shoes.

867
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:54,500
Purchase, sale, keeping accounts.

868
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:55,940
All me.

869
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:57,980
Do you know how to make report forms?

870
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:00,460
Of course.

871
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:03,660
We didn't have computers back then.

872
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,380
I kept all my accounts on paper.

873
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:07,980
I never made a mistake. And I was fast.

874
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:22,360
[Incoming Fang Yuanqing]

875
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:30,260
I was in a meeting.

876
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:31,380
What's wrong?

877
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,180
Nothing.

878
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:34,940
I got a case recently.

879
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:37,580
My client wants everything.

880
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:40,180
My assistant can't do anything.

881
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,620
And my rival is really good.

882
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:43,580
So,

883
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,340
what are you gonna do?

884
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:47,180
I'll do it myself. What else can I do?

885
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,460
But luckily, I asked Aunt Wu.

886
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,780
There's something she can do.

887
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:54,770
She used to do business.

888
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:56,900
She can make some report forms.

889
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:58,860
Actually, I've thought about it.

890
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:00,780
We have one week.

891
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,820
As long as we divide the work properly, we can make it.

892
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,740
I'll do all the designs myself.

893
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,460
Aunt Wu can make report forms

894
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:08,820
and search information.

895
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,420
As long as we click,

896
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:12,180
it should be fine.

897
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,100
Are you sure?

898
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:16,660
She's an old lady in her sixties.

899
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:19,460
She did business

900
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,380
in the '80s or '90s.

901
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,620
She didn't have computers

902
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:24,940
or printers.

903
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:31,330
Right.

904
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:41,940
Aunt Wu,

905
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:44,180
are you kidding me?

906
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:45,610
I asked you to print things.

907
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:48,420
Did you drop these in the ink box?

908
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:52,100
I don't know what's wrong with the machine.

909
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,260
Well, I...

910
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:56,780
I'll ask someone to take a look.

911
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:57,540
Okay.

912
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:59,060
You're not familiar with the machine, fine.

913
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,340
What about these?

914
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,980
I said color printing.

915
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:03,580
Why are they all black and white?

916
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:07,820
Fine, I can forget about all of these.

917
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,060
What about the report?

918
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:10,940
Why haven't you given it to me?

919
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,380
I've sent you the template.

920
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,180
How much have you done?

921
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:14,660
Can you give it to me today?

922
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:16,540
Sorry.

923
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,580
The computer, I…

924
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:19,820
I don't know how to use it yet.

925
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,780
I’m working on the software.

926
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,340
I'll write one.

927
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,060
I can write one.

928
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:27,980
A handwritten form is useless to me.

929
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,540
I need it for my PowerPoint.

930
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,540
Am I supposed to take a photo of it?

931
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,620
You can.

932
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,620
Okay, it's done.

933
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:41,940
Thank you for your hard work.

934
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,540
It's the efforts of everyone of our team

935
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:45,900
that leads to the completion of the preliminary plan.

936
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:46,780
Go home tonight

937
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:47,740
and have a good sleep.

938
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:48,660
Tomorrow we'll gather our energy

939
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:49,620
and check the plan.

940
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:51,980
Hu Dexiang is really good.

941
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,260
Of course.

942
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,740
She has a lot of people working for her.

943
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,260
There's no other

944
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:59,420
chief designer like her in the company.

945
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:00,620
I think she'll win

946
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:01,780
this case.

947
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,450
Obviously.

948
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:07,460
The rumor about her promotion

949
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,060
at the end of the year may be true.

950
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:11,660
She's on fire.

951
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:14,460
They are fast.

952
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:15,380
Sorry, Aunt Wu.

953
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:16,300
I was just anxious.

954
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:17,660
I didn't mean what I said.

955
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,460
You go fix the printer.

956
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:20,980
I’ll make the report forms myself.

957
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:23,460
Jiang.

958
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:25,180
Stop talking. Hurry up.

959
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:27,020
We’re really late.

960
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:58,660
Jiang, slow down.

961
00:40:58,820 --> 00:40:59,940
Why are you walking so fast?

962
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,660
I can't keep up.

963
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,980
I still have a lot of work to do.

964
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:05,580
I have to finish the drawing tonight

965
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,900
so that we can check it tomorrow.

966
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,820
What can I do for you?

967
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:12,020
Really, I can help you.

968
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:15,980
What took you so long?

969
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:17,260
My mom has been looking for you.

970
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:18,770
Oh no.

971
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,340
Today is her birthday.

972
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,260
My phone is dead.

973
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:22,540
Come on! Give me your phone.

974
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:24,340
I'll video call her.

975
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:29,060
Don't be angry, sis.

976
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,260
Anger gives you wrinkles.

977
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:32,460
I'll sing for you.

978
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:37,050
Happy birthday to you!

979
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:40,260
Happy birthday to you!

980
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:44,500
Happy birthday to you!

981
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:48,740
Happy birthday to you!

982
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:50,780
Happy birthday!

983
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:53,780
That's enough.

984
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,580
You only care about your work.

985
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:57,420
You completely forgot about me, didn't you?

986
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:58,860
No.

987
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:01,020
My phone died.

988
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:02,860
I bought you a gift.

989
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:04,060
I'm sure you'll like it.

990
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:05,940
I'll ask Wen to send it to you later.

991
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:07,820
Stop it.

992
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:10,140
You taking good care of yourself

993
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:12,100
is the biggest gift to me, you know?

994
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,420
How are you?

995
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:14,580
Are you tired?

996
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:17,060
You're over 60.

997
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:19,020
Don't push yourself too hard.

998
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:20,580
Don't overwork.

999
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:23,140
Don't worry. I'm doing great.

1000
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,540
See? I'm doing great.

1001
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:31,180
My aunt is old.

1002
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,660
She doesn't have to work overtime until this hour.

1003
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:35,980
What does it have to do with you?

1004
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:36,900
She is my aunt.

1005
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:38,820
Your aunt chose to work,

1006
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:39,660
she has to

1007
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:41,100
take on the responsibilities.

1008
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,500
All kinds of jobs require overtime nowadays.

1009
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,260
I didn't force her.

1010
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,020
She chose all this.

1011
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:48,740
You can tell her that.

1012
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:49,740
You can't blame me for

1013
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:51,010
her wearing herself out.

1014
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:52,860
Besides, she's your aunt, so what?

1015
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:54,300
Everyone is independent.

1016
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:55,980
She didn't say anything.

1017
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,380
You're just being nosy.

1018
00:42:58,460 --> 00:42:59,820
Don't make a fuss over her.

1019
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:05,460
She's on fire.
