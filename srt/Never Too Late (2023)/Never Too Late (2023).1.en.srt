Madam, it's fine that you're old,

Thank you.

I'm just an amateur.

Madam, next,

719
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,860
you consider me as a child in class

720
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,060

00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:16,940
At what age?

724
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:20,090
12 years old. A 12-year-old child.

725
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:22,060
Okay.

726
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:31,500
Students,

727
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,820
let's start the class.

728
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:37,180
When singing, first, you need to

729
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:39,420
feel the power from the diaphragm.

730
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,420
Where is

731
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:43,900
the diaphragm in our body?

732
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,820
Come on, do it with me.

733
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,300
Place both hands

734
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:49,740
on the sides of your belly button.

735
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:54,060
Yeah, a little further.

736
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:55,260
Good.

737
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:56,780
Then,

738
00:39:57,490 --> 00:40:00,260
imagine yourself being very angry,

739
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:02,660
extremely angry.

740
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:05,020
I'm so angry!

741
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:10,060
When you make that sound,

742
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:12,460
do you feel your belly button pushing outward?

743
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:17,340
Yes, that's the diaphragm.

744
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:18,660
Let's do it again.

745
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:19,980
That's okay, madam.

746
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:20,900
Very good.

747
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:22,580
May I ask, have you studied music professionally?

748
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:26,940
Sorry, I've never been to college.

749
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,060
When I was young, my family couldn't afford to

750
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,180
let me study music.

751
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:31,660
I learned it on my own,

752
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:33,340
step by step.

753
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:34,460
But

754
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:35,740
I did sing in our local song and dance troupe

755
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,620
for several years.

756
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,660
If you don't believe in her abilities,

757
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,740
you can give her three months of probation.

758
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:46,380
After all, we are currently short-staffed.

759
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,140
At least give her a chance.

760
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:49,940
Nonsense.

761
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:51,540
Even if we are short-staffed,

762
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,900
we can't have a sixty-year-old filling in.

763
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:55,460
Tell me,

764
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:56,580
what if the children

765
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:57,780
don't listen to her

766
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:58,740
and cause trouble?

767
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:01,260
What if

768
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:02,540
she suddenly collapses during work?

769
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,060
We can't bear that responsibility,

770
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:05,860
no matter what happens.

771
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:17,940
I'm sorry, madam.

772
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,380
It's okay.

773
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:20,900

has been established for five years.

788
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,580
It wasn't until last year

789
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:57,540
that we found the right

790
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:59,300
business model for our survival and growth.

791
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:00,380
Here,

792
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:01,780
it's different from the head office,

793
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:03,100
where they work in teams.

794
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:06,060
Here, every designer is independent.

on their own or form a team with other colleagues.

797

By the way, Ms. Jiang,

798
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,020
this is your desk.

I can adjust it for you.

801

802
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:19,780

Ms. Hu, Hu Dexiang.

807
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:31,860
She is undoubtedly the best

808
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:33,620
in our company in terms of

809
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:36,140
performance and the caliber of her work.

810
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:37,860
We often joke that

811
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:39,090
with Ms. Hu's level,

812
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:40,460
even in the head office,

813
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:41,780
she would stand out.

814
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:42,940
Here comes again.

815
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:44,460

Can't you say something new next time?

817

825
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:04,140
It's your first day at work. Are you busy?

826
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:06,020
Not much things for today.

Why don't you come?

829
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:12,660
I'll pass.

830
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:14,100
Right, Ms. Jiang just came here.

831
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:14,980
It's inappropriate.

832

There are only two chief designers in the company.

833
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:18,980
The intern will either be assigned to you or me.

834
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:21,500
Why don't you take a look?

Now please briefly explain

00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:45,020
why you want to work in our company as designers.

847
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:45,660
Well,

848
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:47,620
I've always wanted to learn design.

849
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:49,180
I really love design.

850
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:51,540
I think your company is very people-oriented.

nurturing those of us

853
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:55,900
without technical skills but with passion.

854
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:57,860
I decided to pursue this career

855
00:43:57,940 --> 00:43:59,060
because I admire the work of Yihe Litong.

856
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:00,340
So, none of you

857
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:02,980
have worked in this field before, right?

858
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:05,340
I studied design in college.

859
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:06,540
Since I want to change my job,

860
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:08,100
I must come for the best.

861
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:10,660
I went to the art school to my third year,

862
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:12,940
and dropped out because something happened at home.

863
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:14,740
But my grades at school...

864
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:15,650

865
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:15,980
were always in the top three.

866
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:17,820
Hello, mentors.

867
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:18,940
My name is Zhao Xue.

868
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:21,260
I really like the Shao'an Coffee

869
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:22,380
designed by Ms. Hu.

870
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:23,460
There is always

871
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:24,980
a unique aesthetic sense in her works.

872
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:26,980
It's like watching a wash painting

873
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:27,910

in a hologram.

875
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:30,820
The combination of tradition and modernity is great.

876
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:32,980
If possible,

877
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:34,980
I hope I can be Ms. Hu's assistant.

878
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:42,980
How many left?

879
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:46,900
We can get off work after the last interview.

880
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:48,740
Alright, keep it up.

881
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:55,540
Hello, mentors.

882
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:03,450
My name is Wu Jingfang.
