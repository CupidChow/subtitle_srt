1
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,680
Old Woodsman

2
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:49,400
Weren't you always

3
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:50,640
watching this ginseng?

4
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:51,680
How could that be?

5
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:55,359
There was only one chance.

6
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:56,959
Brother,

7
00:01:58,239 --> 00:01:59,760
Forest fires are no joke.

8
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,959
If you can't save it, don't force it.

9
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,599
Don't worry.

10
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:04,239
I used to be a woodsman too.

11
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:05,040
I know my limits.

12
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:05,640
Please, keep an eye on

13
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,560
our precious ginseng.

14
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,079
Alright.

15
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,199
The mute boy must have switched it.

16
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:14,879
Old Woodsman,

17
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:16,879
yesterday,

18
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,000
you took us on a detour

19
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,520
to that little pond.

20
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:23,000
In this area,

21
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:25,280
is that the only spot?

22
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,680
Yes.

23
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:31,120
Uncle,

24
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,719
you want to wait there

25
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,639
to catch the mute boy?

26
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,759
He's probably long gone.

27
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:38,000
I took a quick look yesterday.

28
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:39,800
Before we arrived,

29
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:42,000
no one had been there.

30
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:42,840
Alright then.

31
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,759
You stay here and watch Old Woodsman.

32
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:46,479
I'll go to that little pond.

33
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:47,360
and wait for a while.

34
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,080
It's worth a try.

35
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,480
Don't worry, Boss.

36
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:47,759
My uncle is really capable.

37
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,199
He'll definitely get the ginseng back.

38
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:53,920
Boss,

39
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:58,000
Boss,

40
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:26,360
A man from Laiyang, surname Sun,

41
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:30,560
crossed mountains and rivers to dig for ginseng.

42
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:34,879
Lost a good brother along the way.

43
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,759
Can't find him, and it hurts.

44
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,639
Ate a mole cricket for three days.

45
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:47,439
Tell me, isn't that heartbreaking?

46
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,279
Someone from home came looking for me.

47
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,240
Followed the old river upstream to search.

48
00:05:57,879 --> 00:06:00,959
If anyone else gets lost in the mountains,

49
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,480
I'll be their guide.

50
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:52,279
Uh, uh, uh...

51
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,480
No, not this...

52
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,199
Old geezer

53
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:37,759
Where are you running?

54
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,120
I thought you were an old woodsman from the mountains.

55
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,639
Turns out you're just a rookie.

56
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,040
No.

57
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:44,600
What do you really do?

58
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,079
Fine, I'll let you die knowing the truth.

59
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:47,360
Ginseng

60
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:49,160
I switched the ginseng.

61
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,759
What can you do to me?

62
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,160
Since you stole the ginseng,

63
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:53,920
You...

64
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,720
You should've left this forest long ago.

65
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,560
It's all because of this trap pit.

66
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:00,759
Trap pit

67
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:01,879
Yeah, the trap pit.

68
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,120
Since you got out of the pit,

69
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:07,040
Why did you cover it up again?

70
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:07,959
This stupid pit

71
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,199
kept me stuck for two days.

72
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:10,240
I had a rough time.

73
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,319
No one else should have it easy.

74
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,680
Didn't expect it to come true so fast.

75
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,560
Here, take it.

76
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,360
Come back, let's talk things over again.

77
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,360
Uncle

78
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,000
Uncle

79
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,919
Every family is having a reunion.

80
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,679
Holding my ginseng.

81
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:04,519
Hurry up and go.

82
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:29,120
Stop pretending, speak up.

83
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:30,240
Where's my uncle?

84
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:36,559
He's in the pit.

85
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:47,080
Uncle

86
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:53,080
Xiao Gui

87
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:57,840
Uncle

88
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:58,879
We got the ginseng back.

89
00:09:58,919 --> 00:09:59,240
Good.

90
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,200
Go save Lao Batou.

91
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:00,679
Uncle

92
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:01,759
What's wrong?

93
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,200
Lao Batou

94
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,200
He's gone.

95
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,559
Brother

96
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,200
Looks like I won't make it.

97
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:22,039
Inside here are

98
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,960
the names of all the brothers who died.

99
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:30,360
Aren't you fighting the Japanese invaders?

100
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,600
You have to find a way

101
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,559
to get the ginseng back.

102
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:40,639
Take it.

103
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,840
Sell it for money.

104
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,960
Recruit people and buy guns.

105
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:53,200
If you drive out the Japanese invaders,

106
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,200
everyone

107
00:10:57,799 --> 00:10:59,240
can finally live in peace.

108
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,120
Don't worry, don't worry.

109
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,480
As long as we drive out the invaders,

110
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,879
I'll go door to door

111
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:05,960
and return all the money.

112
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:16,200
Whether I can or not,

113
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:19,000
you

114
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:21,919
just count it

115
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,600
as part of fighting the invaders.

116
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:36,639
Gui'er

117
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:38,559
You have to kneel.

118
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,159
Brothers

119
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,240
Lao Batou

120
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,840
This is all the strength we have.

121
00:11:58,519 --> 00:11:59,919
Please forgive us.

122
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:08,799
And also,

123
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:11,919
let us borrow

124
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:14,000
the ginseng gang's outfits.

125
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:17,519
You guys have a strong smell.

126
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,720
This will help us

127
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,200
avoid a lot of trouble on the road.

128
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,519
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

129
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:30,799
Lao Batou

130
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,919
Everything you told us

131
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,000
is engraved in my heart.

132
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,720
You can set out without worry.

133
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,559
Brothers

134
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,559
Safe travels.

135
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,759
What are you doing?

136
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,840
Help!

137
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:41,200
Stop staring.

138
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,320
Go to sleep.

139
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:26,639
Unlucky guy.

140
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:30,320
Take him away.

141
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,919
No one admits who did the killing.

142
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,519
Right?

143
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,559
The ones who stirred up trouble a few days ago,

144
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:50,799
were Korean, correct?

145
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:55,000
All Koreans,

146
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,279
step forward.

147
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,600
Stand to my right.

148
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:01,960
Form a line.

149
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,639
Tell me,

150
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:24,600
who is the killer?

151
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,399
Three.

152
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:30,279
Two.

153
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:41,679
How interesting.

154
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:45,480
I heard you Koreans

155
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,159
are very united.

156
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,799
I’d like to see that for myself today.

157
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,080
Each of you, pick one.

158
00:15:56,919 --> 00:15:59,879
Let’s have an intimate showdown.

159
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:01,480
The rule is,

160
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,519
only one survives.

161
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:05,480
Afterwards,

162
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,480
I won’t pursue this matter any further.

163
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,440
Three, two, one.

164
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:19,480
Aren’t you starting yet?

165
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,720
If you don’t start,

166
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,960
all Koreans

167
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,639
die.

168
00:16:58,679 --> 00:16:59,519
I think

169
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,759
You two need to take this seriously.

170
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,200
Push me harder.

171
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:21,079
Push me harder.

172
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:22,200
Hurry up.

173
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:56,160
Brilliant.

174
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,400
That was truly brilliant.

175
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:02,960
Victory.

176
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,279
Congratulations.

177
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:09,960
Absolutely brilliant.

178
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:11,640
From now on,

179
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:14,720
everyone should get along peacefully.

180
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:16,279
Remember,

181
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,200
the only reason you can stay here

182
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,799
and survive

183
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,440
is to work.

184
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:38,759
Uncle

185
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,720
Wake up, Uncle

186
00:19:57,359 --> 00:19:58,000
Gui

187
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,119
Look over there

188
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:02,519
Am I just seeing things because I'm hungry?

189
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,279
Is that a horse?

190
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:10,880
We keep running into each other

191
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,680
It's fate

192
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,279
Haven't you had enough of a beating?

193
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:18,640
You want more?

194
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,920
Can't let go

195
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,000
I'm awake

196
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,160
How was your sleep?

197
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:45,200
Is this what you told me about?

198
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:45,960
Those two scallions?

199
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,519
Just these two scallions

200
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,880
They've got some skills

201
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:50,680
Skills

202
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,359
What about it?

203
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,839
Can they fly?

204
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,519
Or dig underground?

205
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:00,640
Come on

206
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,240
Let me have a look too

207
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:08,920
Why are you staring at me?

208
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:11,079
Hand over the ginseng

209
00:21:12,359 --> 00:21:14,559
Let this guy play deaf and mute

210
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:16,039
Sneak into the ginseng crew and steal ginseng

211
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,799
Your idea

212
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:21,319
His idea, I did it

213
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,480
Still bragging, huh?

214
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:26,039
Look at how you handled this

215
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:28,640
Didn't you say I didn't need to come down?

216
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:30,319
Hurry up and bring the ginseng

217
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:32,599
Bring the ginseng, bring it here

218
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:37,759
Still thinking about acting tough?

219
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:39,759
You two still have the energy to act tough?

220
00:21:41,799 --> 00:21:42,519
In your pants

221
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:43,559
Stop showing off

222
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,920
Making a mess of everything

223
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:47,519
It's not a good look

224
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,640
Brothers

225
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,400
Show yourselves

226
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:56,799
Everyone, come out

227
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,039
Hand it over, hand it over.

228
00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:43,200
Go away.

229
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,319
Didn't expect you

230
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,039
to be so loose-tongued.

231
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:50,279
You're pretty clever.

232
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,440
You've got some skills.

233
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,160
This guy with seventeen lives on his back

234
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,039
is dangerous to handle.

235
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,759
This mountain is all mine.

236
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,039
You guys are nothing here.

237
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,319
Who has food on them?

238
00:23:24,759 --> 00:23:25,599
Save some for those two.

239
00:23:28,759 --> 00:23:30,160
Don't die on my turf.

240
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:31,599
Tough folks.

241
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:35,920
Leave your name.

242
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,440
White Horse Bandit of Congshan.

243
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,279
Hey, you.

244
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,359
Bring the horse over.

245
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,400
Let's go.

246
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:08,640
Guard dogs in the daytime,

247
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,079
searchlights at night.

248
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,519
They watch us

249
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:13,759
closer than livestock.

250
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,160
After what happened yesterday,

251
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,240
even if we fart now,

252
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:20,279
the Japanese can smell it.

253
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:22,880
If we kill him now,

254
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:25,839
our whole gang

255
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:26,920
would have to pay with their lives.

256
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,319
That Korean guy,

257
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:31,640
what's his story?

258
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,279
Do you know?

259
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:33,400
No idea.

260
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,839
He's pretty tough.

261
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:39,440
Find a chance to talk to him.

262
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:41,960
What?

263
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,400
With him like this,

264
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,599
he was even in the resistance.

265
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:47,720
You know,

266
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:50,000
White Horse Bandit of Congshan

267
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,599
used to be famous.

268
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:54,400
But why is he a bandit now?

269
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,359
That's hard to say.

270
00:24:59,200 --> 00:24:59,720
Uncle.

271
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:01,400
If you hadn't stopped me just now,

272
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,559
I would've fought them.

273
00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:05,799
How many could you take down?

274
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:06,960
Not many, to be honest.

275
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:07,960
Take out the leader first.

276
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,759
I could get White Horse Bandit first.

277
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,400
If we show our weapons,

278
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,799
our cover's blown.

279
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:14,960
The main thing is,

280
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:16,720
what are they up to now?

281
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,079
It's unclear.

282
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,920
If they're connected to the Japanese,

283
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,920
we won't survive.

284
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:28,279
After all this trouble,

285
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,920
almost dying in the woods,

286
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,599
the bandits got the benefit.

287
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,240
I feel sorry for the old leader

288
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:37,160
and our ginseng crew.

289
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,359
We have to endure it.

290
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,559
Eat more, eat up.

291
00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:50,400
Don't let your body give out.

292
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,359
Thanks.

293
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:00,920
This advantage

294
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:02,880
really can't be theirs.

295
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,880
Can't let them take it.

296
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:04,640
Right?

297
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:06,039
So what do we do?

298
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,519
We

299
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:11,640
follow them first,

300
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,160
wait in their hideout,

301
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,400
and act when the time is right.

302
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:16,680
Okay.

303
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:41,160
Bastard.

304
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:51,480
Second brother.

305
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:53,200
Keep an eye on everyone.

306
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:53,759
Okay.

307
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:54,359
Wait for me to come back.

308
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,000
Bastard.

309
00:28:59,160 --> 00:28:59,799
Hurry up and get up.

310
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,640
Is he dead?

311
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:07,960
Get up.

312
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:09,880
Get up.

313
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,440
Get up.

314
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:13,039
Hurry up.

315
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:15,079
Come on, get up, hurry!

316
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:16,720
You two.

317
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:19,640
Yes, you two.

318
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,119
Carry him away.

319
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:30,319
Take him away.

320
00:29:35,559 --> 00:29:37,480
Help me, I don't want to die!

321
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,440
Wait, please wait!

322
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,400
He's still alive.

323
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,039
So annoying.

324
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,519
He's dead this time, right?

325
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:01,319
Take him away.

326
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:40,759
Why are you just standing there?

327
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:41,519
Hurry up.

328
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:54,119
What did I tell you?

329
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:30,599
Uncle

330
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,079
The woman in the car

331
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,599
Why does she look so much like Sister Hua?

332
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:51,920
It really is Hua

333
00:31:56,759 --> 00:31:58,000
That bastard is with him

334
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,039
The bandit chief is back

335
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:22,960
Hurry, open the door

336
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,359
Open the mountain gate

337
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,599
The bandit chief is back

338
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,039
The chief is back

339
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:31,960
The bandit chief is back

340
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,440
Chief

341
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:34,240
Chief

342
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:35,759
How was the haul?

343
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,559
Are you blind?

344
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:37,920
Can’t you see all those carts?

345
00:32:42,759 --> 00:32:43,599
Big brother is back

346
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:45,000
Big brother, big brother is back

347
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:48,759
Big brother

348
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,480
You’re back

349
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,599
Slow down

350
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:00,880
So fresh

351
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:04,799
Big brother

352
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,319
Who is it?

353
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:10,759
Come on, get moving, hurry up

354
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,079
Who is it?

355
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,160
Ask him

356
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:13,920
No

357
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,000
What are you all staring at?

358
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:16,759
Unload

359
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,359
Get to work

360
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:18,960
Unload, unload

361
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:19,839
Come on, unload, unload

362
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:21,359
Hurry up, hurry up

363
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:22,240
Come

364
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:23,440
Take it

365
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:24,759
Take it

366
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:26,680
What are you still thinking about?

367
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,200
Come down

368
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,880
You’re a bandit

369
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:35,759
Doesn’t matter what I am

370
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,119
You’re just herding sheep on the Gobi now

371
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:38,960
You’ve got nothing

372
00:33:41,079 --> 00:33:41,839
Go inside, quick

373
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,359
Check the wound on your leg

374
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:52,640
Second brother

375
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:54,400
Give that job to third brother

376
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:54,920
Okay

377
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,519
Get her inside

378
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:02,480
Can you walk?

379
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,680
If you can walk, go inside

380
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,000
Close the mountain gate

381
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,360
Uncle

382
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:15,880
Let’s go

383
00:34:24,519 --> 00:34:25,039
Us?

384
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,719
We really can’t go head-to-head with them

385
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,360
Sister Hua went into the bandit den

386
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,159
How could that end well?

387
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:39,760
Here’s the plan

388
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:42,559
I’ll go alone

389
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,639
I’ll deal with them myself

390
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:45,119
No way

391
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,719
This time we have to go together

392
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,599
That’s an order

393
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,960
You don’t know the bandit code

394
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:53,320
If you slip up

395
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:54,639
That’ll be big trouble

396
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,199
Here

397
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,400
Stay put

398
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,320
What are you looking at?

399
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:38,519
Go change the water.

400
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,599
How's your leg injury?

401
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,239
Let me take a look.

402
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:48,840
What are you afraid of?

403
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:49,920
I'm not going to eat you.

404
00:35:52,199 --> 00:35:52,519
Come here.

405
00:35:54,039 --> 00:35:54,880
I'll do it myself.

406
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:15,119
You know,

407
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,480
Good thing it's a through wound.

408
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:17,960
Otherwise, the bullet

409
00:36:18,519 --> 00:36:19,719
would've stayed inside your flesh.

410
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:20,719
You get that?

411
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:37,719
You're a tough girl.

412
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:39,280
You've got quite a temper.

413
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:42,280
All by yourself,

414
00:36:42,519 --> 00:36:43,760
you dare to stand up to the Japanese.

415
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:49,480
What do you do?

416
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:52,360
Revenge.

417
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:55,239
Revenge.

418
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,639
What are you avenging?

419
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:01,639
The Japanese killed my mother.

420
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:12,920
What's your name?

421
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:18,400
What is it?

422
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,679
Lan Hua'er.

423
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:26,119
That's a nice name.

424
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:28,039
Lan Hua'er.

425
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,599
That forest we ran into today,

426
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:40,360
I hadn't been there in ages.

427
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,960
But today,

428
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:42,800
I went there,

429
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:44,239
and met you.

430
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,480
Even saved you.

431
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:46,199
So,

432
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,639
isn't this fate?

433
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,519
I brought you some clean clothes.

434
00:37:58,639 --> 00:37:59,440
Change into them later.

435
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,920
This place is called Congshan.

436
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:14,760
As for me,

437
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:16,440
I'm called Xiao Bai Ma.

438
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,159
Anyway, while you're here with me,

439
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:26,639
just two words:

440
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:27,800
Recover.

441
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:32,079
If you want to eat something,

442
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:33,800
just let me know.

443
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,480
If you need anything, call me.

444
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,599
What are you doing here?

445
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,119
Brother, brother.

446
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,679
I need to see your chief about something.

447
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:27,880
Stop right there, don't move.

448
00:39:28,719 --> 00:39:30,280
I really...

449
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:31,679
I have something urgent to discuss with him.

450
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:32,639
Wait here.

451
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,159
The brothers are all doing fine.

452
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:46,840
How is it?

453
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,079
Everyone back home is fine.

454
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:54,159
You sure know how to make conversation.

455
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:57,239
We just met, didn't we?

456
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,880
Just trying to warm things up.

457
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,960
Still trying to warm up, huh?

458
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,079
You're asking for trouble.

459
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:03,719
They'll beat you to a pulp.

460
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:08,039
Why did you come here?

461
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,239
What now?

462
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:09,960
Just you alone?

463
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,559
You think you can take the ginseng back by yourself?

464
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,039
I'm not here for the ginseng, I'm looking for White Horse Bandit.

465
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,800
There's something else.

466
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,079
What is it?

467
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:20,599
So?

468
00:40:22,039 --> 00:40:23,719
Is everyone in the village useless?

469
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,840
I'm here empty-handed.

470
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,960
I came alone.

471
00:40:30,199 --> 00:40:30,840
Scared?

472
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:33,639
Stop wasting time.

473
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:36,159
I don't buy it.

474
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:37,280
You think your fists

475
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,000
can really do anything here?

476
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:40,920
Open the door.

477
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,199
Open the mountain gate.

478
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,639
What are you looking around for?

479
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,400
Stop looking around.

480
00:40:59,559 --> 00:41:00,239
Don't stare aimlessly.

481
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,039
Say what you need to say here.

482
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:11,159
What?

483
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,960
You want to talk right here at the gate?

484
00:41:13,239 --> 00:41:14,639
Don't you know the rules?

485
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,320
Alright.

486
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:20,800
The people inside

487
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,119
are all fine.

488
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:25,039
Don't beat around the bush.

489
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:27,280
Just say it straight.

490
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:33,199
I came up the mountain to find

491
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:34,400
my daughter.

492
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,159
Which one is your daughter?

493
00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:38,400
The one who came up the mountain with you.

494
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,320
She's your daughter?

495
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:42,440
Of course.

496
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,079
So the father-in-law is here.

497
00:41:49,719 --> 00:41:50,239
Come on in.

498
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:51,760
Let's talk inside.

499
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:23,800
Japanese officer

500
00:42:24,159 --> 00:42:24,800
Commander Xiao

501
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:46,920
Yes
