1
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,280
His father

2
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:52,959
Wake up quickly

3
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:56,840
Get up, eat something, then go back to sleep

4
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:58,000
Mother

5
00:01:58,319 --> 00:01:59,359
Who is this person?

6
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:03,959
He is your father

7
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,240
His father

8
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,280
Wake up

9
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:15,439
Get up, eat something, then go back to sleep

10
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:10,720
Sis

11
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:12,439
You're awake

12
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,879
Why don't you sleep a bit longer?

13
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,199
I can't sleep anymore

14
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,079
Are the shoes okay?

15
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:20,040
They fit well

16
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,160
Sis

17
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:24,399
Let me help you

18
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,279
No need, go on

19
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:03,439
Sis, where's our son?

20
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:04,720
He should be back by now.

21
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:09,800
Take it easy.

22
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,199
Nice job, Fuqing.

23
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,879
You're pretty hardworking.

24
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,199
I woke up and saw you were gone.

25
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:18,800
Turns out you were busy here.

26
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,240
Not bad.

27
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,399
You eat here every day.

28
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,160
And you live here too.

29
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:25,120
If you don't help out,

30
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,439
you're just freeloading.

31
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,879
Don't worry.

32
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:28,959
With me here,

33
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:31,480
you'll always have enough to eat.

34
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:33,879
That's right.

35
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:35,639
You're really capable.

36
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:36,879
Looks like this business

37
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:37,759
is almost yours now.

38
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:39,440
What nonsense are you talking?

39
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,879
I'm just a helper too.

40
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,720
We split everything fifty-fifty.

41
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:59,399
You can't split a pear in half.

42
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,080
Tieliang.

43
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:24,440
Tieliang.

44
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:25,960
Give it to me, give it here.

45
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:27,720
When did you go out?

46
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,799
Hey, hurry, get inside.

47
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,200
Hey, wife.

48
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:42,279
Tieliang's back from gathering firewood.

49
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,600
Come here.

50
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,200
Alright.

51
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:07,279
Don't drink that, give it to me.

52
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,639
Eat.

53
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:17,679
Tieliang.

54
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,600
Here, your dad made this for you.

55
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:20,840
Eat this.

56
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:24,360
You.

57
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:27,360
Come back.

58
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:29,360
Tieliang.

59
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:31,879
Come back.

60
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:33,759
Come back.

61
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,240
Come back.

62
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,279
I'm your father.

63
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,360
You have to listen to me.

64
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:52,559
Eat.

65
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,840
Hey, what are you doing?

66
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:03,919
Sis.

67
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:06,039
You eat too.

68
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:07,840
Come on.

69
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,200
No, this is for you.

70
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:23,919
Slow down.

71
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,600
Slow down, don't choke.

72
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:34,679
Sis.

73
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,960
Eat while it's hot.

74
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:37,240
You eat.

75
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:44,200
Now you should call me Dad.

76
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,159
Say it.

77
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:09,320
Hurry, eat while it's hot.

78
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,639
Eat slowly.

79
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,679
Slow down, don't choke.

80
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,279
Son.

81
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,799
Look at you.

82
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,120
What have you been doing outside?

83
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,399
Why did you make yourself

84
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,480
look like this?

85
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:19,480
Eat.

86
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:20,840
It's all yours.

87
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:29,159
Is Pangye home?

88
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:29,519
Who is it?

89
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:30,039
He's home.

90
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,320
Sister-in-law.

91
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:34,240
Why aren't you watching the shop?

92
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,159
A supplier came by.

93
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:37,879
Had to bring a jar of good wine.

94
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,200
Here in Songlin Town,

95
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,639
only Pangye deserves to drink this.

96
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:42,000
So I brought it right away.

97
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:50,799
What's going on? Why so secretive?

98
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:54,200
Go.

99
00:13:58,919 --> 00:13:59,799
Sit, sit, sit.

100
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,000
What brings you here today?

101
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:07,240
Why are you delivering the wine yourself?

102
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:12,279
You must need something from me, right?

103
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:14,519
I want to hire two more workers for the shop.

104
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,440
I've already found the people.

105
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,240
I'm hoping you can help me out, Pangye.

106
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,240
Help me get them some papers.

107
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,919
They don't have any identification.

108
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,039
Zhier.

109
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,480
Dakuozhi.

110
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,799
You need to be careful.

111
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:35,000
They're arresting Anti-Japanese Allied Forces lately.

112
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,200
Pangye.

113
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:37,840
Don't say that.

114
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,759
They're distant relatives.

115
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,200
The two kids were young and didn't know any better.

116
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:44,919
They used to run with the bandits.

117
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:48,759
Pangye.

118
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,200
I'm just a guarantor, Dakuozhi.

119
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:52,519
My whole family and business

120
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:53,679
are all here.

121
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:55,320
No need to risk myself for others.

122
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,960
Why get myself involved, right?

123
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,120
Besides,

124
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,240
I'm doing this

125
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,480
for our own business.

126
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:06,000
So it can keep growing.

127
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,720
Pangye.

128
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,799
This is a fine jar of wine.

129
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,080
Try it yourself.

130
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,480
I'll be leaving now.

131
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:27,200
Alright.

132
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:28,879
Sister-in-law.

133
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,240
I'm heading out.

134
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:42,840
This really is good wine.

135
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:44,679
What did you two talk about?

136
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:46,759
Why do you want to know everything?

137
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:48,759
Why can't I know?

138
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,000
Sit down.

139
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,279
Wine.

140
00:15:57,639 --> 00:15:59,399
Just delivered a jar of wine.

141
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:03,919
Good wine should be hidden away.

142
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:47,799
Our son is sleeping so soundly.

143
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,519
What are you looking at?

144
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,960
You've changed.

145
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,759
Just getting older.

146
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,400
Who says so?

147
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:16,039
I think you've become prettier.

148
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,160
Hit me.

149
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:30,480
Hit me however you want.

150
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,000
I came back this time

151
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,480
just to make you feel better.

152
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:45,039
I thought you wouldn't come back.

153
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:54,960
If you come back, the family comes back together.

154
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,559
Don't leave again.

155
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:02,480
Mother of my child

156
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:04,720
Come on, hurry up

157
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:07,480
What's wrong?

158
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,240
It's done

159
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,039
Tieliang

160
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:14,359
Come here, look

161
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,039
Come on

162
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:17,880
Look

163
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:21,720
Yes, look

164
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,319
Here

165
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:23,279
Just like your mother

166
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,519
Put your left leg

167
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,559
Up here

168
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:26,880
That's right

169
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,200
Wait, wait

170
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,480
It should be here

171
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:31,279
Okay, hurry

172
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:31,960
Put it on quickly

173
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,519
Come

174
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,240
Wait a second

175
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,200
Is it tight?

176
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:50,160
Good

177
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:50,960
Come

178
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:52,680
Give me the crutch

179
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:54,440
Take it slow

180
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,400
Try walking a few steps

181
00:20:56,759 --> 00:20:57,400
See?

182
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,200
Why are you in such a rush?

183
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,599
He needs to get used to it

184
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:01,640
Yes, yes, yes

185
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:03,240
You can't get fat in one bite

186
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:05,240
Practice more

187
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:06,079
It'll be fine with more practice

188
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,119
Come, use it and walk a few steps

189
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:10,200
Go slow

190
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:28,359
Lift your head

191
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:29,279
Lift your head, son

192
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,319
That's right

193
00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:48,759
Dad

194
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:50,920
Why are you sitting here?

195
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,599
You're back

196
00:21:54,759 --> 00:21:56,039
Finished visiting your brother's grave

197
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,119
Yes, it's done

198
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:02,519
Take this

199
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:04,720
What for?

200
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,720
Come with me

201
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,400
What are we doing?

202
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,240
No, I, I...

203
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,839
Come, let's see Commander Xiao

204
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,039
What are you looking at? Go away

205
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:21,359
No

206
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,359
They're all relatives from the village

207
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:24,480
Go away, move aside

208
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:25,799
Why are you claiming kinship here?

209
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:26,559
Don't, don't

210
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,319
Third uncle

211
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:31,440
Third uncle

212
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,559
Third uncle

213
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,799
Old Tang, brother

214
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:40,839
Come in, hurry

215
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,519
See, they're all relatives

216
00:22:43,319 --> 00:22:43,960
Come in

217
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,039
We've been neighbors for years

218
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:50,599
Why are we talking about seniority now?

219
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:52,039
Usually it's all fine

220
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,039
Today I brought Deyuan

221
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:56,759
To pay respects to you

222
00:22:58,039 --> 00:22:59,160
It's not New Year yet

223
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,400
Why pay respects now?

224
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,079
If it weren't for Tielin

225
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,319
This kid

226
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:05,880
He'd be buried in the back hills by now

227
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,359
My family owes you a life

228
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:09,359
Don't say that

229
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,640
Dewang is still watching over the back hills

230
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:13,359
That's all old history

231
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:14,519
Let's not mention it

232
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:19,599
We don't have much at home.

233
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:21,880
Just brought some charcoal.

234
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,920
You really didn't have to.

235
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:25,000
It's enough that you came.

236
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,079
No need to bring anything.

237
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:28,319
Uncle.

238
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,200
We're all family here.

239
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,799
No need to be so polite.

240
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:37,000
Tielin.

241
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,559
Our Tangjia Village.

242
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:41,960
You're the most capable one here.

243
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,720
The villages near the mountains outside.

244
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,279
All were taken by the Japanese.

245
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:51,400
The "Imperial Japanese Army".

246
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:54,839
Yes, yes, that's right.

247
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,519
All were relocated by the "Imperial Japanese Army".

248
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,000
Our Tangjia Village.

249
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:05,359
Can still stay peaceful like this.

250
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,160
This...

251
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:07,480
It's all thanks to you.

252
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:09,039
You're here holding things down.

253
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,119
Uncle.

254
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:13,960
Don't say that.

255
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:16,680
I'm just a small-time commander.

256
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:19,240
I don't have that much influence.

257
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,119
I'm not even enough for a handful.

258
00:24:22,279 --> 00:24:23,920
Barely enough for a plate.

259
00:24:24,039 --> 00:24:26,200
Not enough for a dish.

260
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,799
The main thing is,

261
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,960
The Light of the Imperial Way

262
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:35,039
shines over all of Northeast China.

263
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,680
Plus, our villagers

264
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,599
also support Sino-Japanese friendship.

265
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:47,279
Yes, that's right.

266
00:24:48,039 --> 00:24:48,960
Today, I

267
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,079
am putting my old face on the line.

268
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:52,279
Tielin,

269
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,039
You saved Deyuan's life.

270
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:57,720
See the good deed through to the end.

271
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:00,000
Take him in.

272
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,960
At least,

273
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,759
How should I put this...

274
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,759
You're the commander.

275
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,319
Under your command,

276
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,359
give him a job.

277
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,200
Can you do that?

278
00:25:11,319 --> 00:25:11,799
Dad.

279
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,079
Quiet.

280
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,480
Uncle.

281
00:25:17,079 --> 00:25:18,359
Me take him in?

282
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:22,279
Or is he taking me in?

283
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,480
He's an important person.

284
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,839
He's seen the world.

285
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:32,039
He's a Buddha in a big temple.

286
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,680
I'm just a ghost in a small temple.

287
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,480
He has big dreams.

288
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:40,519
Big ambitions.

289
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:42,440
Big aspirations.

290
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:45,279
He's a big, big, big shot.

291
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:46,599
No, no, no, Tielin.

292
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,759
We're all from the same village.

293
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:49,799
We're neighbors.

294
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,200
Are you worried

295
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,039
he won't listen to you?

296
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:56,720
Don't worry.

297
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,359
As long as I'm alive,

298
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:01,000
if he doesn't listen,

299
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,319
I'll show you

300
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:03,440
if I can't break his leg.

301
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:04,319
Don't worry.

302
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:05,880
Tielin,

303
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:08,160
don't forget,

304
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:10,640
when you were four,

305
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:13,559
you and his brother went to play by the river.

306
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:15,400
Both of you fell

307
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,319
into an ice hole.

308
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,039
It was your Uncle Tang who saved you first.

309
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:19,880
No, no, no.

310
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:21,200
His brother didn't make it.

311
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:24,119
Your Uncle Tang got rheumatism from it.

312
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:25,680
He couldn't stand straight for life.

313
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:27,480
Tielin,

314
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:29,680
your life

315
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,480
was given by your Uncle Tang.

316
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:32,519
Dad,

317
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:34,440
I remember that.

318
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:36,680
How could I forget?

319
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:40,519
Our family owes theirs a life.

320
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,559
That's right.

321
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,000
But on the other hand,

322
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:46,480
this time I also risked

323
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,000
losing my head.

324
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,839
to save him.

325
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,400
Right?

326
00:26:53,799 --> 00:26:54,279
Yes.

327
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:55,720
It's even now.

328
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,200
It's even.

329
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:02,839
Besides,

330
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,440
what good things are there?

331
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,039
How could I not think about him?

332
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,480
Does he ever have anything good?

333
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:10,680
Would he ever think about me?

334
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,440
He's as stubborn as a mule.

335
00:27:14,839 --> 00:27:16,519
My rope is too thin.

336
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,279
I can't tie him down.

337
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,640
Say something.

338
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:26,359
Dad.

339
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,599
Let's not make things hard for him.

340
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:30,799
Besides,

341
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,039
I'm not picking up a gun anymore.

342
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:53,480
You're not picking up a gun anymore?

343
00:28:14,119 --> 00:28:15,160
Old Tang.

344
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,559
Old Tang.

345
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,799
Why did you leave by yourself?

346
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:20,720
Old Tang.

347
00:28:59,200 --> 00:28:59,880
Yunhu

348
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:03,400
The snow has stopped this time.

349
00:29:04,839 --> 00:29:06,319
We should go to Eight Pine Trees now, right?

350
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,720
Say something.

351
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,519
Okay.

352
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,440
Then let's go tomorrow.

353
00:30:55,079 --> 00:30:55,680
Yunhu

354
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,680
I'm here.

355
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,599
One

356
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:02,680
Ten

357
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:04,880
Eighteen

358
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:07,079
Squad Leader

359
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:08,759
Xiaogui

360
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:10,039
Eighteen

361
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:10,759
Hua'er

362
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,359
Right?

363
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,799
All three of them are fine.

364
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:26,519
That's it.

365
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:29,359
Why are there only these few numbers?

366
00:31:29,799 --> 00:31:30,759
What about the others?

367
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:33,920
Sixi, Xiao Hanzai, and the others.

368
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,839
Lao Tang isn't here either.

369
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,319
Lao Tang is number nine.

370
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,240
So Lao Tang...

371
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,839
Does that mean he's in trouble?

372
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:49,960
No.

373
00:31:50,599 --> 00:31:52,240
Maybe something delayed him on the way.

374
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:54,079
We just got here too.

375
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:55,160
In a couple of days.

376
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:55,960
In a few days.

377
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,200
Let's come back and check again.

378
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,400
It's fine.

379
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:05,720
Okay.

380
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,440
Let's not worry about anything else.

381
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,160
Let's carve our names.

382
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,039
Can you help me carve mine?

383
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:33,079
This is important.

384
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
You have to do it yourself.

385
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,559
Let's go.

386
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:16,559
Go inside and search.

387
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,200
Yes.

388
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,000
Who are you?

389
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:24,720
Move.

390
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,400
Over there.

391
00:33:32,839 --> 00:33:33,440
Get down.

392
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:34,839
Kneel.

393
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:38,759
Taikun

394
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,640
There's nothing left at home.

395
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,119
Get out.

396
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:05,680
Taikun

397
00:34:06,359 --> 00:34:07,920
There's nothing left at home.

398
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,440
Really, there's nothing left.

399
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:14,639
Next house.

400
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:27,320
Coming.

401
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,119
Please come in.

402
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,039
Sit anywhere.

403
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:31,360
It's midday.

404
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,480
This tavern is pretty quiet.

405
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:36,360
Didn't run into them?

406
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:39,119
The "Imperial Army" came.

407
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,159
Everyone's hiding at home.

408
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,639
Waiting for the house searches.

409
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,599
How could you not run into them?

410
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,519
The little money hidden at the waist

411
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,960
was all taken by them.

412
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,840
Spending money to avoid disaster.

413
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,639
What would you like to eat?

414
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,480
Just say whatever.

415
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:56,360
I'm not in the mood.

416
00:34:56,599 --> 00:34:57,280
Anything is fine.

417
00:34:58,199 --> 00:34:59,960
Like I said, spending money to avoid disaster.

418
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:01,559
As long as we're safe.

419
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,840
Little Copper Leg

420
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,559
Braised donkey meat

421
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:07,679
Chicken stewed with mushrooms

422
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,719
Pork stewed with vermicelli

423
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:09,679
Catfish stewed with beans

424
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,480
Hurry up.

425
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:11,760
This meal's on me.

426
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,559
Catfish stewed with beans

427
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:14,599
Smells so good it runs all over the place.

428
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:15,159
Not bad.

429
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:16,880
That's more like it.

430
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,400
Want a drink?

431
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:19,239
To warm up.

432
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:19,760
Sure.

433
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:25,719
Come on.

434
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,960
If you're not busy, sit and chat for a bit.

435
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:31,159
Alright.

436
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:33,119
Let's chat.

437
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,079
Where are you from?

438
00:35:37,159 --> 00:35:37,920
Yuanbao Town

439
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:43,159
That's not close.

440
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:48,559
These Japanese

441
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,719
are really cruel.

442
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,199
Careful, you can't say that out loud.

443
00:35:54,039 --> 00:35:55,239
Can't even run a proper business.

444
00:35:55,519 --> 00:35:56,480
Am I wrong?

445
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,440
My business is doing fine.

446
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:00,559
You just came at the wrong time.

447
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:02,840
To be honest,

448
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,920
Why the sudden change of face?

449
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:06,000
Your honest words

450
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:08,960
make my ears burn.

451
00:36:14,119 --> 00:36:15,119
Honest advice is hard to hear.

452
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,440
That really hit home.

453
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:20,119
Go out and turn right.

454
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:21,800
At the end is the police station.

455
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,480
If you have advice, go tell them.

456
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,000
If you're really brave,

457
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,679
go argue with the "Imperial Army".

458
00:36:27,639 --> 00:36:29,119
Why bother a food seller like me?

459
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,159
Why make a fuss here?

460
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,519
You just don't want to waste good food and drink.

461
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,920
You're holding back.

462
00:36:41,559 --> 00:36:42,840
That's just how I am.

463
00:36:56,519 --> 00:36:57,159
I'm busy.

464
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:10,760
Boss Zhu.

465
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:13,079
Model household for public order.

466
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:14,840
Law-abiding citizen.

467
00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:19,280
The "Imperial Army" finished checking over there.

468
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,519
They're waiting for you.

469
00:37:49,639 --> 00:37:50,199
That person

470
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:51,599
got on the boss's bad side.

471
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:54,280
He's no good.

472
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,960
He never tells the truth.

473
00:37:56,639 --> 00:37:57,320
What did he say?

474
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:58,960
Yuanbao Town these days

475
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,800
has been raining nonstop.

476
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:00,840
The roads have collapsed.

477
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:01,920
We can't deliver the liquor.

478
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:03,960
There's no mud on his shoes.

479
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:04,960
Where did he come from?

480
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,239
Yuanbao Town.

481
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,239
Who knows what he's up to.

482
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:15,199
What are you doing? Get to work.

483
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:32,320
Gao Yunhu.

484
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,920
Be honest with me.

485
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:35,320
What are you really thinking?

486
00:38:35,559 --> 00:38:36,519
Why should I tell you?

487
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:38,119
I'm worried you

488
00:38:38,199 --> 00:38:39,559
are already soft in that woman's arms.

489
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,880
What are you talking about?

490
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:42,800
Say that again.

491
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:44,400
I'm saying you

492
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,280
are acting lovesick.

493
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,400
Soft in that woman's arms.

494
00:38:46,519 --> 00:38:47,280
Who are you talking about?

495
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,000
Touch me again.

496
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:48,639
So what if I do?

497
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:49,360
Touch me again.

498
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,079
So what if I do?

499
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:52,000
Come on, Wan Fuqing.

500
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:52,679
Get down here, come on.

501
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:53,320
Get down here.

502
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,039
What's up?

503
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,639
Who are you messing with?

504
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:56,599
Let me tell you,

505
00:38:56,599 --> 00:38:57,960
You're just too well-fed.

506
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,679
I've been too good to you.

507
00:38:58,679 --> 00:38:59,599
You make trouble all day.

508
00:38:59,679 --> 00:39:00,519
I let you feed me.

509
00:39:00,519 --> 00:39:01,440
I didn't even want to eat.

510
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,280
I spit it all out.

511
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,039
Come here, get over here.

512
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:03,960
What do you want?

513
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,159
What do you want?

514
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,000
Get over here.

515
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:06,760
Are you

516
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:08,639
really think you can beat me?

517
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:09,159
I can't beat you.

518
00:39:09,159 --> 00:39:09,719
Gao Yunhu.

519
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,199
Do you think

520
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,119
you're stronger than me?

521
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:14,719
Come on.

522
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:20,760
Stuff it down my collar.

523
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,559
You do mine first.

524
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:21,960
You.

525
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,400
Me.

526
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,280
I'll fight you.

527
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,440
I'll fight you.

528
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:27,480
I'll fight you.

529
00:39:28,519 --> 00:39:29,559
Your arms are so long.

530
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,519
I'll push you to the end.

531
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,880
You're not giving me any air.

532
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,400
Right?

533
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,119
You're not giving me any either.

534
00:39:42,199 --> 00:39:42,760
I'm freezing.

535
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:50,599
Gao Yunhu.

536
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,360
Everything you said before

537
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,599
was just hot air, right?

538
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,119
What did I say?

539
00:39:56,719 --> 00:39:57,760
Didn't we swear

540
00:39:59,559 --> 00:40:00,840
if anyone in this world

541
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,199
is still bullied,

542
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,440
or hasn't had a good life,

543
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,760
we'd keep fighting for them.

544
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:08,360
Did you say that or not?

545
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,440
Look at you now.

546
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,119
Can you say

547
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:19,159
you haven't thought about Da Kuozhi?

548
00:40:19,159 --> 00:40:19,840
Had feelings for her?

549
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:29,440
Where's my hat?

550
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,199
Stuffing snow down the collar

551
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:41,920
So heroic

552
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:29,800
Sir

553
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,480
Not long ago in Songlin Town,

554
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,559
a hideout was just taken down.

555
00:41:32,679 --> 00:41:33,280
At this time,

556
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,679
there shouldn't be any Anti-Japanese Allied Forces left.

557
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,519
Let me be honest with you.

558
00:41:38,519 --> 00:41:39,480
Old Walnut

559
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,920
was one of our Imperial Japanese agents.

560
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,639
His death

561
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,639
is not that simple.

562
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,400
Make sure to investigate thoroughly.

563
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:49,920
No, sir.

564
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:50,760
Old Walnut

565
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,639
was one of our Imperial Japanese agents.

566
00:41:55,639 --> 00:41:56,199
In the past,

567
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,360
Come here.

568
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:03,920
He was a fisherman.

569
00:42:04,199 --> 00:42:04,679
Idiot.

570
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:05,920
Wait, wait, this—

571
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,239
It's issued by the police station.

572
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,000
He's deaf, he can't hear well.

573
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,719
Sorry, I've met the officer before.

574
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,480
Sorry.

575
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:14,280
Speak more quietly to the officer.

576
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:15,599
If you see them again,

577
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:16,760
just leave them alone.

578
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:18,360
Sorry, sir.

579
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,280
Sorry, sorry.

580
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:21,920
Really sorry.

581
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:28,159
Hurry up and go.

582
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:31,199
Yunhu

583
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,559
I'm blunt when I speak.

584
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,320
Don't take it to heart.

585
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:35,840
Who doesn't want enough food and warm clothes?

586
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:36,599
To live a good life.

587
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:37,880
Wait a moment.

588
00:42:47,239 --> 00:42:48,360
Stop it, Fuqing.

589
00:42:49,679 --> 00:42:50,960
As long as the Japanese are still here,

590
00:42:51,719 --> 00:42:53,159
none of us can live well.

591
00:43:00,519 --> 00:43:01,000
Let's go.
