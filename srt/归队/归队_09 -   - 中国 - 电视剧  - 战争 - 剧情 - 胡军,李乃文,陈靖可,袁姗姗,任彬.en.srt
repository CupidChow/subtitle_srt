1
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,439
Be careful.

2
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:47,760
What are you doing?

3
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:50,599
Move it over here.

4
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,599
Unload the goods.

5
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Park the vehicle

6
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,920
at the agreed spot.

7
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:07,879
Yes.

8
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:23,800
Captain Xiao.

9
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:24,599
Taikun.

10
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:26,280
A great harvest.

11
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:27,919
Great joy.

12
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,719
I brought for Taikun

13
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,360
food, drinks, and supplies.

14
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:33,919
And bath water.

15
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,400
In Chinese,

16
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,000
this means clean and tidy.

17
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:38,639
Brings good luck.

18
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:41,080
Brothers, please help move these.

19
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:43,280
You guys, go move the stuff.

20
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:43,800
Yes.

21
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,639
Captain Xiao.

22
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,879
Thank you for your cooperation all this time.

23
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:50,919
So,

24
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:52,199
the Major has decided

25
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,680
to invite you to join the Autumn Festival.

26
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,199
Let's have a drink together to celebrate the harvest.

27
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,039
Yes.

28
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,080
It's my honor.

29
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,000
It's my honor.

30
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:34,039
All eight old trees are here.

31
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,400
Uncle.

32
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,599
Which pine tree?

33
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:40,840
That one.

34
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:42,840
The tallest and thickest one.

35
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:56,960
Look carefully.

36
00:03:57,719 --> 00:03:58,199
Okay.

37
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:03,719
How is it?

38
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,439
Is there anything?

39
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:07,080
Uncle.

40
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,520
Not a single mark is carved.

41
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:18,839
Logically,

42
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,480
We stayed at Tuozipen

43
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,240
for quite a while.

44
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:23,480
We should be the last to arrive.

45
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,360
They should have arrived first.

46
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,439
Right?

47
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:29,319
None of them made it out.

48
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:33,680
That can't be.

49
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:36,560
No, that's impossible.

50
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:42,199
Look,

51
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
the Japanese soldiers

52
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,879
have been searching the mountains nonstop.

53
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:51,240
They've scared all the villagers.

54
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:52,680
So,

55
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,720
they're all hiding from our Anti-Japanese Allied Army.

56
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:58,759
And the bandits,

57
00:04:59,279 --> 00:04:59,959
and also

58
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:01,439
the puppet troops,

59
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:02,639
none of them are quiet.

60
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:07,720
On their way here,

61
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:09,839
they must have suffered more than us.

62
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,360
It was even harder for them.

63
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,879
Xiaogui, Xiaogui.

64
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,600
Carve ours

65
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,839
and Hua's marks

66
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,959
on the tree first.

67
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:33,879
Okay.

68
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:16,800
Uncle

69
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,519
The mark is finished.

70
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:19,160
Okay.

71
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,879
Let's go back to Songlin Town and wait for them.

72
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:23,959
Let's go back.

73
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,839
The liaison station in town

74
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,439
is gone.

75
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,199
This means

76
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,120
the Japanese are already watching us.

77
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:34,040
It's just the two of us.

78
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,920
And we're carrying so much money.

79
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,040
Going back won't end well.

80
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:42,920
Their group wanted to rob the ginseng.

81
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,000
They didn't want to pay.

82
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:45,600
Now the money's gone.

83
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:46,680
They definitely won't let us go.

84
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:51,160
We need to lay low for a while.

85
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:54,639
Gui'er

86
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:56,360
Uncle promised you

87
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,240
you could go home to see your father.

88
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,439
Now's a good time. Go home.

89
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:02,160
Uncle

90
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:04,079
If I go home, what about you?

91
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,040
I... I miss home too.

92
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:13,279
Once things calm down,

93
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,680
I'll come find you at your place.

94
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:16,199
Then we'll go out together again.

95
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:17,040
And get them.

96
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:17,800
Alright.

97
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,560
Where did you carve it? Let me see.

98
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:23,800
Right here.

99
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:29,759
Knife.

100
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,160
Make it deeper.

101
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,160
Gui'er,

102
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:50,319
whether you're on your way home

103
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,120
or at home,

104
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,160
watch what you say.

105
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:54,399
And

106
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,680
don't do anything reckless.

107
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,639
Don't give yourself away.

108
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,160
Don't reveal your identity.

109
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:01,680
Got it, Uncle.

110
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:18,360
Hello, sister-in-law. Hello!

111
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:18,839
Hello, sister-in-law.

112
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:19,560
What are you washing?

113
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,439
Radishes, sister-in-law.

114
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,920
I'll make something tasty for you tonight.

115
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,800
Great, thank you, sister-in-law.

116
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,439
Thank you, sister-in-law.

117
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:25,319
Little Sichuan, come here.

118
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,040
I sewed some clothes for you. Take a look.

119
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:27,720
How is it?

120
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:29,240
It's good, thank you, sister-in-law.

121
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,439
Sister-in-law, sister-in-law.

122
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,279
Check if the herbs we just dried are any good.

123
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,080
Let me see.

124
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:38,759
They're pretty good.

125
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:39,759
Give them to me.

126
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,120
Alright, I'll be going then.

127
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:16,799
Captain Xiao

128
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:18,679
Let's celebrate

129
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,919
the joy of the harvest

130
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,240
May your life

131
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,039
be filled with wonderful memories

132
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,679
You have also contributed

133
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:29,120
to the Empire

134
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,840
Sir

135
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,879
For the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity

136
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,720
you traveled thousands of miles

137
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:37,000
crossed the sea

138
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,039
and came to Northeast China

139
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,799
What surprised me is

140
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,919
your Chinese

141
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,600
is really good

142
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:46,279
almost like a Northeasterner

143
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,000
Oh my!

144
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,039
Captain Xiao

145
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:55,799
I heard you know a lot about Japanese culture

146
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,960
and have studied it deeply

147
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,519
especially Japanese songs

148
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:13,879
I'm dying to hear them

149
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,639
That's great

150
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,679
That's great

151
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,080
Cheers

152
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:24,960
Cheers

153
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:34,159
Before I blow up the oil depot

154
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,320
you must take out these sentries

155
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,320
When the explosion draws the enemy away

156
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,240
everyone rush out together

157
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:50,440
Attention

158
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,840
The Autumn Festival in the Empire

159
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:56,440
is to celebrate the harvest

160
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,159
Today we hold the Autumn Festival

161
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,279
to celebrate

162
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,120
the completion of the first phase of construction

163
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:12,080
I hope that by this time next year

164
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,759
China's land will have become

165
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:16,080
a gift to His Majesty the Emperor

166
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,919
Today is a milestone

167
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:19,559
Let's keep working hard

168
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,919
Let's all raise a toast

169
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:23,240
Cheers

170
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:23,919
Cheers

171
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,200
His Majesty the Emperor

172
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,840
Long live

173
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,200
Long live

174
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,279
Long live

175
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,639
Long live

176
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,159
Captain Xiao

177
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,440
I've had enough to drink

178
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:48,480
I'll excuse myself

179
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:49,600
Alright

180
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:50,879
Goodbye

181
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:51,919
Goodbye

182
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:07,679
Sir

183
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,679
Something's wrong

184
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,639
Come quickly

185
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:11,679
What's the matter?

186
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:12,039
Sir

187
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:12,919
There's trouble here

188
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,840
Someone called our festival nonsense

189
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:19,759
Insulted our Autumn Festival

190
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:21,320
It's him

191
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,759
I didn't do it, sir

192
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:25,799
I didn't

193
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:27,159
I didn't do it, sir

194
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:30,720
I didn't say it, I didn't say it

195
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:15,360
Let me tell you something.

196
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,840
That big pit we dug a few days ago,

197
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:20,000
was for the Japanese to bury us alive.

198
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,399
You definitely don't want

199
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:24,159
to die here, right?

200
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,519
Soon, I'll drive

201
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:28,200
over to pick you up.

202
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:30,120
Listen to Fuqing's instructions.

203
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,240
We'll rush out together.

204
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:34,279
These two Japanese soldiers

205
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,399
were killed here.

206
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:36,919
Tonight, no one in this room

207
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,559
should expect to survive.

208
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:42,759
Why are you still

209
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:43,600
standing around?

210
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,279
Either way, it's death.

211
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,960
What's more important than life?

212
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,799
It all depends on this chance.

213
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:50,320
Soon, follow me

214
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:51,799
and we'll charge out together.

215
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:53,120
Got it.

216
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:54,519
Are you okay?

217
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,680
I haven't seen you before.

218
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,480
Yamamoto.

219
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:31,720
I brought some wine. Let's drink together.

220
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,240
What happened?

221
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:05,400
Report!

222
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,279
There was an explosion near the oil depot.

223
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:08,640
Go check it out quickly.

224
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,240
Hurry, hurry!

225
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:13,200
That bastard!

226
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:14,640
Let's go.

227
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:15,519
Yes, sir.

228
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,359
Captain.

229
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,240
Move!

230
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:25,480
That bastard...

231
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:26,640
Wait!

232
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,400
Stop, stop, stop.

233
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:00,720
What's wrong?

234
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,000
Just go if you want.

235
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,279
Why did you blow up their oil depot?

236
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:03,920
We'll talk about it later.

237
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:04,720
Let me drive.

238
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:06,759
What's up?

239
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,799
You want to drive?

240
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:08,920
What are you trying to do?

241
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,319
No, I...

242
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:12,039
We need to bring the others.

243
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:13,759
Why do you care about them?

244
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,359
Just leave, that's enough.

245
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:16,319
Take them with us.

246
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:17,400
I'll get myself killed for this.

247
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,599
We can't just abandon them.

248
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:20,079
I don't have that many lives to lose.

249
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:21,319
Brother, I'm begging you.

250
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:22,880
Alright.

251
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,440
I'll do as you say.

252
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:26,680
Because you're my brother.

253
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,039
Thank you, brother. Thank you.

254
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,559
Old Tang.

255
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:49,200
Old Tang.

256
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,160
Old Tang.

257
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,559
What's going on?

258
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:08,720
I don't know either.

259
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,119
Old Tang isn't in the car.

260
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,519
No, I have to go find him.

261
00:21:11,559 --> 00:21:11,920
Wait—

262
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:14,240
What about the others?

263
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:16,680
I have to find Old Tang.

264
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:17,640
Darn it.

265
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,039
The Japanese are catching up.

266
00:21:20,119 --> 00:21:20,519
Hurry, go!

267
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:21,359
Go, now!

268
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,720
The car's here, let's go!

269
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,000
The car's here!

270
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:37,920
Hurry!

271
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,359
Old Tang!

272
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,359
Quick, chase them!

273
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:20,920
Stop.

274
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,720
If you want to live, come with me.

275
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,400
Hurry, go!

276
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,319
Run!

277
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:26,400
Everyone, keep up!

278
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:27,839
Wait!

279
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:31,440
Head into the woods!

280
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,480
Quick, go, go!

281
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,200
Spread out, don't bunch together!

282
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:39,640
Get out of the car, quickly!

283
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:40,759
Over there!

284
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:45,119
Search over there, move faster!

285
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:45,880
Chase them!

286
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,319
Yes!

287
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:54,599
Hurry, hurry, faster!

288
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,440
Everyone, keep up!

289
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,640
Run uphill!

290
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:11,920
Split up!

291
00:24:12,039 --> 00:24:12,920
Split up!

292
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:17,359
Run!

293
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:25,880
Faster, faster!

294
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,319
I'm Japanese!

295
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:44,440
I'm Japanese!

296
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:46,599
Don't kill me!

297
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,799
I'm Japanese!

298
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,480
Don't kill!

299
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,519
Keep chasing!

300
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,119
Don't let them get away!

301
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:07,799
Quick!

302
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,119
I'll carry you, let's go!

303
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,680
Leave me, go!

304
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:17,000
Go!

305
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:22,000
Li Zhenghao!

306
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:27,359
Chase them!

307
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:28,119
Stop!

308
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,119
There's no way ahead!

309
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:36,799
Where can we run?

310
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:39,519
There's no way out!

311
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,359
What do we do now?

312
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:42,799
What now?

313
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,400
Shoot!

314
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,119
Jump!

315
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,400
If we don't jump, we'll die anyway.

316
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:26,240
Don't kill me.

317
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:27,440
Don't kill me, I won't run anymore.

318
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,359
Get out of the way.

319
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,519
Retreat.

320
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,880
Xiao Tielin

321
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,039
You bastard!

322
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,119
We could've taken them with us.

323
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:49,519
Why not?

324
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,039
Stop shouting.

325
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:52,680
They're all gone.

326
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:55,160
Xiao Tielin

327
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,000
Xiao Tielin

328
00:27:58,039 --> 00:27:58,920
Bastard!

329
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:04,519
Fu Qing

330
00:28:08,839 --> 00:28:10,240
I got you all into trouble.

331
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,920
Go, quickly!

332
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,160
Hurry!

333
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,400
Fire!

334
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:35,039
Now presenting the beautiful Lan Ruilian.

335
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
The young lady is

336
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,880
sitting in her room.

337
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,200
Suddenly hears her mother-in-law

338
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,480
shouting loudly.

339
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,000
She puts down her steel needle,

340
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,000
winds the yarn,

341
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,359
gathers the colorful threads,

342
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:59,559
all five colors of blue.

343
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,039
She bows slightly,

344
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:03,440
and from under the bed,

345
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:05,319
Er Jinlian stands

346
00:32:05,319 --> 00:32:06,920
on the flat ground.

347
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,880
I say, you little brat,

348
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,880
are you trying to starve me?

349
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:12,480
It's already noon,

350
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:14,039
why haven't you made me lunch yet?

351
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:16,119
Remember this,

352
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,000
I want to drink

353
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,440
spring water that hasn't touched the ground.

354
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:19,400
After I finish this bowl,

355
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,519
bring me the next one.

356
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:21,480
Did you remember?

357
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,680
What are you thinking?

358
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:23,920
Go make food.

359
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:26,079
You brat, go cook.

360
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,200
Never learn.

361
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:32,839
Mother-in-law.

362
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:40,759
The young lady feels sad when she hears this.

363
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:45,880
Mother-in-law nags every day.

364
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,200
She steps out of the room.

365
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:51,000
The kitchen is just ahead.

366
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:51,680
Yunhu.

367
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:53,279
Okay.

368
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:54,319
Alright.

369
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,200
Fuqing.

370
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,559
How are you still alive?

371
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,920
You're still alive.

372
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:26,640
Come in, come in, come in!

373
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,400
This is your room.

374
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,000
But now it's ours.

375
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,000
Come on, come in.

376
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,000
Get on the kang quickly.

377
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:33,880
It's warm on the kang.

378
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:34,599
Come.

379
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:36,920
Feels warm, right?

380
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:37,640
This warm kang.

381
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:39,599
You're enjoying comfort now.

382
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:40,799
What comfort?

383
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,079
Hurry.

384
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,640
Tell me,

385
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,799
what happened to you?

386
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:45,640
How did you end up like this?

387
00:33:48,279 --> 00:33:49,880
You should tell me first.

388
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,799
How come you're not dead?

389
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,640
I'll tell you.

390
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:56,680
Just one sentence.

391
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:58,799
Someone saved me.

392
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,559
So I survived.

393
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:03,880
Survived a great disaster,

394
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,920
there must be blessings ahead.

395
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,759
You're enjoying good fortune now.

396
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:08,719
Alright.

397
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:10,280
Quick, tell me

398
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,880
what really happened.

399
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:17,559
Come.

400
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:18,400
Serve me some.

401
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,840
Are you sure you saw it clearly?

402
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:32,920
Old Tang really wasn't on the truck?

403
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:34,840
I saw it for sure.

404
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:36,599
That truck at the time,

405
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:37,800
passed right in front of me.

406
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:39,639
Old Tang wasn't on it.

407
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,559
I wanted to go back for him.

408
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:43,599
But I couldn't go back then.

409
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:44,480
You know?

410
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,280
If I went back,

411
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,639
I'd be killed by the Japanese.

412
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,320
When I looked back,

413
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:49,599
there were still people behind me.

414
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:51,440
I had to lead them away.

415
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,079
Just like back at Jinggou,

416
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,079
when I saw you trapped in the mine.

417
00:34:58,159 --> 00:34:59,800
I wanted to go back and save you too.

418
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,400
But they

419
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:02,800
wanted to kill both of us.

420
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,440
You know?

421
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,119
If I went back,

422
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:06,199
I'd die there too.

423
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,519
So I ran by myself.

424
00:35:09,559 --> 00:35:11,880
I didn't go back to save you.

425
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:12,480
Yunhu.

426
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:13,320
Why are you crying?

427
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,599
Don't blame me, Yunhu.

428
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:15,920
I don't blame you, so why are you crying?

429
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,039
Why would I blame you?

430
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,400
Don't cry, don't cry.

431
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:19,679
I ran by myself.

432
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,880
Why go back?

433
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:22,599
If one survives, that's enough.

434
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,119
Don't cry.

435
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:25,760
Stop crying.

436
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,519
Stop crying, be good.

437
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,199
So what happened after?

438
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,440
Was it okay?

439
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:38,599
Give it here.

440
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,079
In that pile of bodies,

441
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,880
was Old Tang there?

442
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:51,880
No.

443
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,159
I checked, Old Tang wasn't there.

444
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:56,880
He wasn't the one hanging halfway up the mountain either.

445
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:01,960
Don't panic.

446
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:02,880
It's okay, it's okay.

447
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:04,159
We're family, we're family.

448
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:05,559
It's fine.

449
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:10,320
Here, here.

450
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,280
The front yard is busy.

451
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:12,679
I grabbed two dishes when I had a moment.

452
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:13,559
Heated up two buns.

453
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,960
Not enough for you to talk about.

454
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:15,679
Alright.

455
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:17,840
Just something to fill your stomach.

456
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:19,079
Where did this living ghost come from?

457
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:19,760
What living ghost?

458
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:20,719
This is my brother.

459
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:21,800
My real brother.

460
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:23,519
Closer than real brothers.

461
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:25,159
Alright.

462
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:26,880
Real brothers get fed, come on.

463
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,679
Go do your work, it's fine.

464
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:29,599
What are you doing?

465
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,320
We've got guests at home.

466
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,679
Can't I say hello?

467
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:33,119
No, the smell is strong.

468
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:34,239
It'll stink you up again.

469
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,599
It smelled even worse when you first came.

470
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:38,800
Help boil water for a bath.

471
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,559
Sorry for the trouble.

472
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,320
Always something.

473
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:44,800
Thanks.

474
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:51,880
Come, come.

475
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,239
You must be starving.

476
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,079
Eat while it's hot.

477
00:36:55,239 --> 00:36:56,360
You just said we're family.

478
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,119
I mean,

479
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:00,239
I meant our own people.

480
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:01,440
Our own people.

481
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:03,599
Yeah, that's right.

482
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:04,920
Won't harm us.

483
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:07,280
Eat, eat, eat.

484
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,639
Yunhu.

485
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,400
It's all meat.

486
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,960
You eat this every day?

487
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:18,239
Not every day.

488
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,719
I eat it every meal.

489
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,639
No wonder you're

490
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:23,480
so fair and chubby.

491
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:25,000
Alright, you believe whatever I say.

492
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:25,760
Now that you're here,

493
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,760
I can treat you.

494
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,519
Eat up.

495
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:28,440
Stop talking.

496
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:32,599
Then I'll eat.

497
00:37:32,599 --> 00:37:33,440
Go ahead, eat.

498
00:38:07,639 --> 00:38:08,840
Slow down, slow down.

499
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:13,400
Are you full?

500
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,199
This cup is for Old Tang.

501
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:43,480
Fu Qing.

502
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,039
Maybe Old Tang is still alive.

503
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,119
Aren't we both doing fine?

504
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:50,920
Right?

505
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:55,880
Yeah.

506
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,000
That's a good point.

507
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,800
Let's hope Old Tang is still alive.

508
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:09,159
Hope all our comrades are well.

509
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,239
Cheers.

510
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:23,320
Feeling warmer now.

511
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:28,760
Qing.

512
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:31,000
You've really had a tough journey.

513
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:34,920
All these years.

514
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,800
Haven't we all lived like this?

515
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,400
Alright.

516
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:11,119
The northwest wind blows to Guandong.

517
00:40:11,719 --> 00:40:15,679
Yesterday's heavy snow weighed down the pines.

518
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,639
The drifting snow turned the yellow dog white.

519
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,440
Covered that white dog.

520
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:28,960
Don't sing here.

521
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,079
Go sing at the graves on the back hill.

522
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:45,559
Xiao Tielin.

523
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,400
Listen to your voice.

524
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,480
What a mess you are.

525
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,519
And you call yourself Xiao Tielin.

526
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,519
You've been complaining the whole way.

527
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:56,159
We're home.

528
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,000
Hurry home and have some water.

529
00:40:58,079 --> 00:40:59,000
Moisten your throat.

530
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,079
Dad.

531
00:41:15,079 --> 00:41:15,719
Mom.

532
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,119
You're back.

533
00:41:19,559 --> 00:41:20,360
Son.

534
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:22,239
How long can you stay this time?

535
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:22,920
Mom.

536
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,320
I can't stay long.

537
00:41:24,519 --> 00:41:25,079
I...

538
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,320
Don't move.

539
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:29,599
Stand there.

540
00:41:31,719 --> 00:41:32,440
You guys.

541
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,960
Take the stuff inside.

542
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:35,559
There's more in the car.

543
00:41:38,519 --> 00:41:39,159
You.

544
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:40,719
Go out.

545
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:51,679
Come on, get inside.

546
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,360
Mom.

547
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:58,159
The northwest wind blows to Guandong.

548
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:02,440
Last night's snow weighed down the pines.

549
00:42:03,079 --> 00:42:06,840
The drifting snow turned the yellow dog white.

550
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:13,480
The white dog ended up swollen.

551
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:22,320
The northwest wind blows to Guandong.

552
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,440
Yesterday's heavy snow weighed down the pines.

553
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,400
Mom.

554
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:44,280
Who is it?

555
00:42:44,599 --> 00:42:45,199
It's me.
