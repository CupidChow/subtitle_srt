1
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,000
Son

2
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:46,680
Slow down, don’t choke.

3
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,280
Son, that’s enough.

4
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:57,040
You’ve eaten enough.

5
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,000
You’ll get stuffed eating like that.

6
00:01:58,239 --> 00:01:59,400
Your stomach’s going to burst.

7
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:08,520
Young master, please slow down.

8
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,599
Don’t choke.

9
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:12,439
Here.

10
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:19,000
Are you full now?

11
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:23,520
Still hungry?

12
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:34,479
Look at you.

13
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:39,520
I’m telling you.

14
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:41,479
Say something.

15
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,439
Talk to your dad.

16
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:44,080
You’re driving me crazy.

17
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:46,080
Dad

18
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,520
I thought I’d never make it back.

19
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,039
I thought I’d never see you again.

20
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,879
Dad

21
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:00,960
I almost thought I wouldn’t make it home.

22
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,080
Wouldn’t see you again.

23
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,000
Son

24
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,120
He’s finally recovered.

25
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,520
Changshun

26
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:10,000
Go.

27
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,280
Ginseng chicken stew.

28
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,639
And big steamed buns.

29
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,120
Steamed buns, steamed buns.

30
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:14,680
Steamed buns.

31
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:16,919
Son

32
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:18,319
Dad

33
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:48,919
Young master

34
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,039
On patrol.

35
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:54,919
Let me see.

36
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,080
Young master

37
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,080
You like this too?

38
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:05,319
It’s dangerous.

39
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:07,759
I wouldn’t dare.

40
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:11,280
Go get busy.

41
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:12,439
Alright, young master.

42
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:54,680
Dad

43
00:04:57,959 --> 00:04:59,439
First, offer incense to your mother.

44
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,480
Mom

45
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,319
Your unfilial son has come home.

46
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,199
May your spirit in heaven

47
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,680
rest assured.

48
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,120
Dad

49
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:11,879
Let’s go outside and talk.

50
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:14,959
Why go outside?

51
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,439
Let’s just talk here.

52
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:17,560
So your mom can hear too.

53
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,920
Hey Mom,

54
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,839
Xiaogui is here.

55
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:29,399
Listen up.

56
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,720
Xiaogui,

57
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:36,079
Where did you come back from?

58
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,680
I came back from outside.

59
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,639
Obviously.

60
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,240
Dad, you already know, why ask?

61
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:49,519
You came back,

62
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:51,680
but look at the state you’re in.

63
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:56,399
The unit was broken up.

64
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,480
So now,

65
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,040
no one takes care of food or shelter.

66
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,040
You started missing home.

67
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:02,720
Isn’t that right?

68
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,079
Dad, since you’re at home,

69
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:05,199
I had to come back sooner or later.

70
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,120
Alright.

71
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:10,879
At least you came back in one piece.

72
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,800
You’re still breathing, aren’t you?

73
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:16,560
Are you leaving again?

74
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,839
Let’s talk about it when the weather warms up.

75
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,120
You’re still thinking of leaving?

76
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:23,879
Can’t you give your dad a break?

77
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:25,759
Dad

78
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:29,160
You know I’m doing the right thing.

79
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:30,959
Did you hear that?

80
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,360
That’s just how you are.

81
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,839
We sent you to Harbin to study,

82
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:40,439
but you joined a bunch of passionate people.

83
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,639
You didn’t study,

84
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:43,240
and joined the Volunteer Army.

85
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,480
Then you became part of the Anti-Japanese Allied Forces.

86
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,480
You’ve been gone for years.

87
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,000
You know,

88
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:53,959
it’s a blessing you made it back alive.

89
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:55,519
That’s all thanks to

90
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:56,959
our ancestors’ protection.

91
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,560
But now,

92
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,759
we’re living under the Japanese

93
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:04,480
trying to survive right under their noses.

94
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:07,120
They haven’t dug up our ancestral graves.

95
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,759
That’s because they see our family

96
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,480
as big and influential.

97
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:12,759
Not like those Anti-Japanese fighters in the mountains.

98
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:13,839
We’re not on the same side.

99
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,120
You’ve been gone all these years,

100
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,560
do you know how your dad got through it?

101
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,920
I couldn’t sleep night after night.

102
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:24,040
Every night, I’d stare wide-eyed.

103
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,800
My chin rubbing against the blanket.

104
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,199
Making a scratching sound.

105
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,800
Finally, I’d make it to dawn.

106
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:31,160
Just as I started to doze off,

107
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,480
I’d jerk awake.

108
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,320
Sweat pouring down my forehead.

109
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,600
My heart pounding so hard,

110
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,720
it felt like

111
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,759
it would jump out of my throat.

112
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:38,759
I’d toss and turn in bed,

113
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:40,240
like a pancake flipping.

114
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,080
Son,

115
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,720
can you stay this time?

116
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,240
Can you let your dad

117
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,720
get a good night’s sleep?

118
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:54,799
Can you let your dad

119
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:56,200
live a little longer?

120
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:02,600
I can’t.

121
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,240
Today, in front of your mom,

122
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,320
you have to give me a straight answer.

123
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,480
I can.

124
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:13,440
Can what?

125
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:15,559
Let you sleep peacefully.

126
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,399
You—

127
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,840
You’re not leaving?

128
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:22,960
Say it out loud.

129
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,879
Say it so your mom can hear.

130
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:24,600
Go on.

131
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,519
I’ll listen to you, Dad.

132
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,200
Good.

133
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:29,519
Good.

134
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:31,200
Your mom heard it all.

135
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,440
Don’t lie to your mom.

136
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:00,360
Tieliang

137
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,879
Don’t slack off.

138
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:04,440
You need to practice more.

139
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,240
Once you’re skilled,

140
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,519
you can finally throw away the crutch.

141
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,399
Did you hear me?

142
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:11,919
Get up.

143
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:12,960
Get up and start practicing.

144
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,759
Slow down.

145
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:56,840
Come on, son.

146
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,559
You've been practicing for quite a while now.

147
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:00,440
Give it a try.

148
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:01,440
Put down the crutch.

149
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:02,399
Take a few steps.

150
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:15,399
Son.

151
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:16,960
Son.

152
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:24,600
When did it get worn down like this?

153
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,879
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

154
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:32,000
Don't blame your dad.

155
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:34,399
Your dad just wants what's best for you.

156
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,200
It's all the Japanese's fault.

157
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,360
If it weren't for them,

158
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:41,360
cutting off your leg

159
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,200
and feeding it to the dogs,

160
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,639
you wouldn't be like this.

161
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:58,639
Go.

162
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,480
Tie Liang's dad.

163
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:21,600
Tie Liang's dad.

164
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,440
Don't worry.

165
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,039
You haven't been home for years.

166
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,759
The two of us have been

167
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,480
doing just fine.

168
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:07,559
Tie Liang is sensible.

169
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,440
He cares about his mother.

170
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:15,559
His leg isn't much use,

171
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,720
but he's never gotten sick,

172
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:19,200
and we've never had any disasters.

173
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:21,960
When the Japanese came,

174
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,200
they saw it was just the two of us,

175
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,480
and there was nothing to take.

176
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,759
So they left us alone.

177
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:30,679
These two plots of land

178
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,480
are enough for the two of us

179
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,639
to eat and have clothes.

180
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:37,960
When the harvest is good,

181
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:39,919
we can even trade for some cloth

182
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,320
to make your son new clothes.

183
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:44,960
He really treasures them.

184
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:52,519
Tell me,

185
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:56,519
what kind of father

186
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:00,120
have I been, really?

187
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:37,320
Thank you, sister-in-law. Thank you.

188
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,679
It’ll keep you warm in winter.

189
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,840
Come on, everyone gets one.

190
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,399
Slow down.

191
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,519
Sister-in-law made these.

192
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,759
Wash your feet before you wear them.

193
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:46,360
Everyone gets one.

194
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:48,320
Wear these in winter to stay warm.

195
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:49,360
Sister-in-law made them.

196
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:50,840
Everyone washed their feet.

197
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,440
Then you can wear them.

198
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:53,799
Go home and wash your feet for me.

199
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,120
Don’t rush.

200
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,679
There’s enough for everyone.

201
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:58,919
Whose feet smell like pickled cabbage?

202
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:01,120
Come on, thank you, sister-in-law.

203
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:02,480
Thank you, sister-in-law.

204
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:05,440
Come here.

205
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,279
Thank you, sister-in-law.

206
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,759
Go home and wash your feet for me.

207
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,440
Hurry up.

208
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,879
Everyone gets one, thank you, sister-in-law.

209
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:10,399
Come here.

210
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,240
What are you laughing at?

211
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,240
I’m feeling really happy inside.

212
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:25,240
Don’t move.

213
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,120
Let me do it.

214
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:29,240
Hua’er.

215
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:32,320
Tell me, how did I get so lucky?

216
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,279
To have found such a good wife like you.

217
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:40,559
All these years,

218
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:42,919
Even my mother never made me

219
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:43,840
clothes this nice.

220
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:47,519
Do you like them?

221
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:50,279
I do.

222
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,320
But I like you even more.

223
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:04,039
Hua’er.

224
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:09,759
I’m truly blessed.

225
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,639
Are you hungry?

226
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:14,840
I’ll go to the kitchen.

227
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,039
I’ll make you something tasty.

228
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,639
You’re a grown man.

229
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,919
Why are you going to the kitchen?

230
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:19,879
What’s wrong with that?

231
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,799
What’s wrong with a man going into the kitchen?

232
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:23,159
It’s not embarrassing.

233
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:25,639
For you,

234
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,320
I’d go anywhere, not just the kitchen.

235
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:29,759
Wherever you want me to go,

236
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,039
I’m willing.

237
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:36,639
Wait here.

238
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,639
I’ll be right back.

239
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:52,839
There are so many of them.

240
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,079
They're having a meeting today.

241
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,000
I ran into them.

242
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,480
It felt really heavy.

243
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,000
Here.

244
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:41,039
Eat.

245
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,519
You have some too.

246
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,880
As soon as spring started,

247
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,119
you rushed

248
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,160
to plow the fields.

249
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:17,400
Now you’re leaving.

250
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,359
I never dared to ask you

251
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,400
all these years,

252
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:31,119
how many Japanese soldiers you’ve killed.

253
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:35,079
Quite a few.

254
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:39,519
So I thought your revenge

255
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:40,920
was almost complete.

256
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:43,599
Can’t you stay?

257
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:49,519
The enemy is still here.

258
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:52,160
So I can’t stop.

259
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,200
You used to keep telling me

260
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,920
about the country, the nation.

261
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:07,240
I never understood.

262
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:09,440
Is the country

263
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,759
really more important than our family?

264
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:19,400
Let me put it this way.

265
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:23,799
They

266
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:26,200
want to dig up

267
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,960
the ancestral graves of Chinese people.

268
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,880
They even want to

269
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:35,000
dig up our ancestors and scatter their ashes to the wind.

270
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,519
Isn’t that serious?

271
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:48,160
Move aside for a moment.

272
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,799
All of this

273
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:55,039
I prepared for you.

274
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,720
I know I can’t make you stay.

275
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,039
I was just talking nonsense earlier.

276
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:10,559
Look.

277
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:14,200
When did you get all this together?

278
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:16,000
So much.

279
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:28,960
Sister,

280
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,920
you’ve had a hard time with this family.

281
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,279
I’m really not much of a man.

282
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:37,279
Who says that?

283
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:38,880
The men in our family

284
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,839
always risk their lives for big things.

285
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:45,920
If you have to go,

286
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:47,880
then go quickly.

287
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,559
My son and I will wait for you at home.

288
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:03,079
Dad

289
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,559
Dad

290
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:01,599
Mom

291
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:03,319
Let me do it.

292
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:05,880
You sit down.

293
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,720
I’ve been used to this for a long time.

294
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,559
Son,

295
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:22,720
Take this with you.

296
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,559
The road is tough.

297
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,799
Travel well, even if home is poor.

298
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:36,640
The roads outside

299
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,319
are hard to walk.

300
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:40,759
Son,

301
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:42,640
As the old saying goes,

302
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,160
water flows downward,

303
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,880
but people should strive upward.

304
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:50,880
You need to find a steady job.

305
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,240
Following your brother Xiao

306
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,559
isn’t that good?

307
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,400
Mom,

308
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:58,720
This is too much money.

309
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,480
I can’t use it all.

310
00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:01,319
Just take it.

311
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:01,839
It’s too much money.

312
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:02,839
Is anyone home?

313
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:07,480
Is anyone home?

314
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:13,119
What are you doing?

315
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,880
Just asking for some water.

316
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:19,160
Wait here.

317
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:42,920
Thank you.

318
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,000
Thank you, thank you.

319
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,079
Where are you from?

320
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:51,119
Three

321
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,680
150 kilometers away.

322
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,920
I walked all the way here.

323
00:27:59,799 --> 00:28:01,039
I wish I could’ve taken a ride.

324
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,039
But around here

325
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,640
the Japanese have swept through

326
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,599
and left nothing behind.

327
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,160
Forget about seeing a cart,

328
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,920
I haven’t even heard a donkey on the road.

329
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:13,640
Here.

330
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,960
Is this Brother Old Tang’s place?

331
00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:21,279
Is Deyuan home?

332
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:26,880
Who are you?

333
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:30,119
I’m your son’s comrade.

334
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,559
We’re tied together

335
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,880
like brothers in arms.

336
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,480
He’s never come back.

337
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,359
That rascal

338
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,640
got slapped by me twice that year.

339
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,400
His face dropped,

340
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,599
and he ran off just like that.

341
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:03,480
Haven’t seen him in years.

342
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:07,359
That brat.

343
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:09,279
If I catch him again,

344
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:11,480
I’ll break his legs.

345
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:16,200
Brother,

346
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,079
Let me be honest with you.

347
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:22,440
In the unit,

348
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,680
I’m his squad leader.

349
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:25,799
No, he’s not.

350
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,359
He’s not with the Anti-Japanese Allied Forces.

351
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:32,079
He’s doing business outside.

352
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:37,039
Doing business?

353
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,880
Back then,

354
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,079
Deyuan wanted to leave home to join the Anti-Japanese Allied Forces.

355
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,640
You wouldn’t let him.

356
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,160
You locked the door.

357
00:29:58,279 --> 00:29:59,880
And nailed boards to the windows.

358
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:01,480
But he

359
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,839
broke the window and escaped.

360
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:05,640
He’s been gone for six years.

361
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:06,880
Right?

362
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,680
Your eyes...

363
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:23,799
Do you even need to ask?

364
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,160
Once that unfilial son left,

365
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:29,519
I haven’t seen him alive or dead.

366
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,319
In times like these,

367
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:33,400
how can anyone think positively?

368
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:36,119
Worried,

369
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,039
crying...

370
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:41,440
Drink up.

371
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,079
Don’t burn yourself.

372
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,240
You haven’t eaten in days.

373
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,200
Deyuan,

374
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:10,359
he’s a good man.

375
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,519
Brave and careful.

376
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,839
He’ll achieve great things one day.

377
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,319
Here, good.

378
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:20,079
Don’t burn yourself.

379
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:21,160
No, no, I’m good.

380
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:37,720
Smells so good.

381
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:39,680
I'll have another bowl.

382
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:40,759
No, no, no.

383
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,440
When you're hungry, your stomach shrinks.

384
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,160
It can't handle too much.

385
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:49,079
How many people are in your family?

386
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,480
Wife.

387
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:52,640
Son.

388
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:56,519
How could you leave your warm bed?

389
00:31:57,079 --> 00:31:58,160
And come all the way out here?

390
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,079
Brother,

391
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:02,519
I have another family.

392
00:32:04,599 --> 00:32:05,720
That family is huge.

393
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:07,400
Lots of people.

394
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,400
Men, women, young and old, all together.

395
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,480
From all over the country.

396
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:16,359
All kinds of accents.

397
00:32:16,759 --> 00:32:18,160
It's lively when we're together.

398
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:20,839
There,

399
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:23,079
We're even closer than family.

400
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:27,440
We share good fortune.

401
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:28,799
And face hardship together.

402
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,559
If someone goes missing,

403
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,079
Everyone worries.

404
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,440
We think of them, miss them, and search for them.

405
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:39,799
Even if

406
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,519
we wear out our shoes

407
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:43,839
from walking so much,

408
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:48,279
and our hair turns gray searching the mountains,

409
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,599
no one gets left behind.

410
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,160
Everyone must be brought home.

411
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:54,519
Alright.

412
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,000
If we can't meet again,

413
00:32:58,799 --> 00:32:59,559
I'll be on my way.

414
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:01,039
I won't trouble you anymore.

415
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:01,799
Wait a moment.

416
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,599
His mother,

417
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:06,960
bring the wild vegetable cakes.

418
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,599
Let him take them for the road.

419
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:11,680
So, what's your plan next?

420
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:13,519
What are you going to do?

421
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:21,240
I'll stop at Yuanbao Town to the east.

422
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,440
Rest for a bit.

423
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,440
Then look for the next family.

424
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,559
Take it slow on the road.

425
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,079
Brother Lao Tang,

426
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:37,319
if Deyuan comes back,

427
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,319
ask him to send us a message.

428
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,200
As long as we know

429
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,240
he's safe, that's enough.

430
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,200
But you,

431
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:44,880
with people scattered everywhere,

432
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,200
how can you send a message?

433
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:47,680
He knows how.

434
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:32,920
The knife isn't sharpened yet.

435
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,079
I'm talking to you.

436
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:54,199
I know.

437
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,360
You get restless staying here.

438
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,760
Feels boring.

439
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:00,760
What can we do?

440
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:02,960
The platoon leader told us to wait here.

441
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,360
Where else can we go?

442
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:07,840
Just worried about some people.

443
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,760
They say they want the platoon leader to come.

444
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,639
But in their hearts,

445
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,320
Who knows what they're thinking.

446
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:22,719
Think whatever you want.

447
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,559
No one cares.

448
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:34,920
Hold on.

449
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:37,679
Wait a second.

450
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:39,159
I need to discuss something with you.

451
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,760
I've been thinking these past couple days.

452
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:49,280
You said to wait for the platoon leader.

453
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,000
Maybe he'll come tomorrow.

454
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,039
Maybe in a year or so.

455
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,480
Maybe in three or five years.

456
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,079
We're both grown men.

457
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,119
We can't just stay holed up

458
00:35:58,119 --> 00:35:59,039
in someone else's place forever.

459
00:35:59,119 --> 00:35:59,360
Alright.

460
00:35:59,360 --> 00:35:59,840
So I...

461
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,000
No need to say more.

462
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:03,000
I get what you mean.

463
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:05,159
I'll leave right now.

464
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:06,119
You stay.

465
00:36:06,199 --> 00:36:06,880
No, Fuqing, wait—

466
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:08,519
When did I ever say that?

467
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,440
I meant the two of us

468
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:09,920
should find something to do.

469
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,199
Isn't that what you meant?

470
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:12,239
What do you mean?

471
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:13,440
I wouldn't have come.

472
00:36:14,679 --> 00:36:15,920
You were lying comfortably in a woman's house.

473
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:16,920
Living easy.

474
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,360
Then I showed up,

475
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,360
dragged you out,

476
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,599
and keep bothering you every day.

477
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,880
We're not kids anymore.

478
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,320
No need to beat around the bush.

479
00:36:23,559 --> 00:36:24,159
As for me,

480
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:25,880
I'll go my own way.

481
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:27,920
You enjoy your warm bed.

482
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,119
From now on, we'll mind our own business.

483
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,119
Never see each other again.

484
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:33,280
Wan Fuqing, you—

485
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,440
What's gotten into you? Come back!

486
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,480
What are you doing?

487
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,480
What are you up to?

488
00:36:36,679 --> 00:36:37,280
Are you going to hit me?

489
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:38,559
Go ahead.

490
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:46,280
What the heck?

491
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,559
Gao Yunhu.

492
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:49,320
Let me ask you one thing.

493
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:49,800
Keep your voice down.

494
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,639
If the platoon leader comes,

495
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:55,519
will you leave or not?

496
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:02,199
See?

497
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,880
Talk about serious stuff and you clam up.

498
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:06,880
I'll go, I'll go. Who said I wouldn't?

499
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:08,199
As soon as the platoon leader arrives, I'll leave.

500
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:12,360
Why do you always make a fuss?

501
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,400
Always causing trouble.

502
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,440
What did you just say?

503
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,760
What business should we do together?

504
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:21,920
Are you a dog or something?

505
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,239
You change your attitude in a flash.

506
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,280
Baizhang, please.

507
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:28,599
Go ahead, go ahead.

508
00:37:29,639 --> 00:37:30,519
Baizhang is here.

509
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,840
Xiaogui is back.

510
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:35,960
He finished his studies.

511
00:37:37,239 --> 00:37:38,000
Baizhang, what's this about?

512
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,400
Go on with your work.

513
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:40,599
I just came to visit.

514
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,159
Please, come in.

515
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,599
Old Tiantou.

516
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:47,960
Please, come in.

517
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,599
Xiaogui is a good kid.

518
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,800
He's grown up now.

519
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,599
Didn't bring a wife back?

520
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,639
I don't have a wife.

521
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:57,880
You silly kid.

522
00:37:58,719 --> 00:37:59,760
Just a poor student.

523
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,719
All alone out there.

524
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,599
And you expect him to find a wife?

525
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:07,679
Village Chief, Dad.

526
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,039
I’ll head back inside first.

527
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,000
Wait a moment.

528
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:14,360
The Village Chief came to see you.

529
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,760
Why are you leaving?

530
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,639
Stay a bit longer.

531
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:19,239
Sit down and talk.

532
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:22,239
The Village Chief thinks highly of you.

533
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:22,800
Come on.

534
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:26,039
This kid...

535
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:27,400
Old Tian.

536
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,400
Students these days are something else.

537
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,280
I heard in the city,

538
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,440
the ones leading protests and causing trouble

539
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:37,880
are all students.

540
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:39,159
Really?

541
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:41,079
That’s in the city.

542
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,880
Around here,

543
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:44,719
what student would dare rebel?

544
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,400
Besides,

545
00:38:46,519 --> 00:38:47,440
my son Xiaogui

546
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,079
graduated years ago.

547
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:50,920
Graduated?

548
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:53,480
Where’s he working now?

549
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,039
A good job?

550
00:38:56,119 --> 00:38:57,480
Not high, not low—just in between.

551
00:38:58,119 --> 00:38:59,559
He got frustrated out there.

552
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,039
So he packed up

553
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:01,599
and came back.

554
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:03,440
Xiaogui,

555
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,199
I have to speak for your dad now.

556
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:06,199
Say a few words to you.

557
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:07,679
Listen up.

558
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:10,320
You’ve been to school,

559
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,199
you can read and write.

560
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:12,760
Right?

561
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,360
You left for years and never came home.

562
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:17,000
Not a single letter.

563
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:19,039
Not even a word sent back.

564
00:39:19,719 --> 00:39:22,039
You made your dad worry so much.

565
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,639
He thinks of you every day and night.

566
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,239
He’s just afraid you joined the Communist Party.

567
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:30,039
Is he a Communist?

568
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:31,559
No, he wouldn’t dare.

569
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:32,760
He definitely wouldn’t.

570
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:34,440
Did you hear that?

571
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,960
Scolding means caring.

572
00:39:37,159 --> 00:39:38,320
Your uncle cares about you.

573
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,239
You should thank your uncle.

574
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,199
The Village Chief is right.

575
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:45,960
Call him uncle.

576
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:46,840
This kid...

577
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:47,880
Well...

578
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:49,239
He’s still immature.

579
00:39:50,199 --> 00:39:51,679
No, no, it’s fine, it’s fine.

580
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,880
If he doesn’t, that’s okay.

581
00:39:53,719 --> 00:39:54,679
Don’t make it hard for him.

582
00:39:55,639 --> 00:39:56,679
As long as he listens to me,

583
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,719
that’s enough.

584
00:39:59,599 --> 00:39:59,960
I can.

585
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:00,920
Yes.

586
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,480
He just got back,

587
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:04,719
let him settle down first.

588
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,159
As for the past,

589
00:40:06,199 --> 00:40:07,039
let’s not bring it up.

590
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,519
He’s our only child after all.

591
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,719
From now on,

592
00:40:11,079 --> 00:40:12,360
inside and outside this house,

593
00:40:12,519 --> 00:40:13,719
we all rely on him.

594
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,800
Parents always worry about their children.

595
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:22,360
I’m leaving.

596
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:24,880
Come.

597
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:25,400
Alright.

598
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,639
Come on, come on.

599
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,440
Xiaogui,

600
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,760
Find yourself a wife soon.

601
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:38,199
So your dad worries less.

602
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:40,519
That’s right.

603
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:43,320
I’m off.

604
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:49,679
Your son, I tell you,

605
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,599
he’s going to keep you busy in the future.

606
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:52,719
Now that he’s back this time,

607
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:53,880
don’t let him leave again.

608
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:55,280
Listen, Chief,

609
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,119
let me tell you something.

610
00:40:56,639 --> 00:40:58,039
He’s actually a really honest kid.

611
00:40:59,559 --> 00:41:00,599
Just keep an eye on him.

612
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,079
Don’t let him cause you any trouble.

613
00:41:03,559 --> 00:41:04,559
Even if I had ten times the courage,

614
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:05,480
I still couldn’t do it.

615
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,519
With your watchtower standing tall,

616
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:11,639
and your men armed,

617
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:13,440
if you couldn’t handle it,

618
00:41:14,199 --> 00:41:15,599
would I let you be the Chief?

619
00:41:17,239 --> 00:41:18,440
You know what’s going on.

620
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:19,960
Tell me,

621
00:41:20,119 --> 00:41:22,280
all these dozens of households are connected.

622
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:24,199
Even if we’re not related by blood,

623
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,559
we still have to stand together.

624
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,000
As long as you know what’s up.

625
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,000
Take care, take care.

626
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,239
Get lost.

627
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:29,079
Get up.

628
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:30,440
All of you, get lost.

629
00:42:30,519 --> 00:42:31,039
Go away.

630
00:42:35,159 --> 00:42:36,000
Can I sit here?

631
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:36,960
Don't sit here.

632
00:42:37,039 --> 00:42:37,760
Go! Go away!

633
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:38,239
Get lost.

634
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:38,880
Get up.

635
00:42:39,239 --> 00:42:39,719
Get out of here.

636
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:40,639
Filthy beggar.

637
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:41,639
Go! Get lost.

638
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:43,599
Go away.
