1
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:58,840
Dabiaozi

2
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,200
Dabiaozi

3
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,400
Dabiaozi

4
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,199
Bagtou

5
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,120
Where did he disappear to?

6
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,840
He’s dozing inside.

7
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:15,719
Five coffins

8
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,120
Not a single one missing

9
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,719
Isn’t this four coffins?

10
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,039
See, one, two, three, four

11
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:28,800
How many coffins?

12
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,840
That’s not right

13
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,520
Buried five, but loaded six

14
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:35,800
Why is there one extra?

15
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,439
Doesn’t that include me?

16
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,319
All the way here

17
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:39,120
I barely touched the ground

18
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,319
Couldn’t even catch my breath

19
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,960
So we’re still missing one

20
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:45,919
No, that’s wrong

21
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,240
There were definitely five when we came in

22
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,000
Take it

23
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,280
Keep an eye on it

24
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,560
Over here

25
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:00,680
Move aside

26
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:14,000
Darn

27
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,000
Missing a tough one

28
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,840
Where are you going?

29
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:29,879
I’m coming in with you

30
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,240
Why are you coming in?

31
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,680
Stay here and watch

32
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,080
If one more goes missing

33
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,479
I’ll use you to make up the numbers

34
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:45,840
Pangkuozhi

35
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:49,280
I’m using your place to talk business

36
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:51,599
Because your liquor is good

37
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,560
And your food smells great

38
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,039
You know the rules

39
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:56,360
For the food and drinks

40
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,120
I paid you every cent

41
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,319
Go ahead

42
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,960
Where did you take him?

43
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,439
Can’t blame the outhouse if you can’t poop

44
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:10,439
Cut the crap

45
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,080
Where is he?

46
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:13,719
Easy

47
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,800
Break another table leg

48
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,079
You’ll have to give it crutches

49
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,120
That depends on you

50
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,759
If you can get into the mountains

51
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,360
And pick the right goods

52
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:28,319
I run a business here

53
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:30,480
You dumped a dead man at my place

54
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,199
So what?

55
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,759
You expect me to watch him for you?

56
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:37,399
What do you mean?

57
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,959
Think I paid too little for drinks?

58
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:42,360
Trying to scam me?

59
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:45,759
I do honest business

60
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,519
I don’t take money I shouldn’t earn

61
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,720
But you wildcats

62
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,879
Don’t even think of cheating me

63
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:56,399
Who knows if it’s fate

64
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:57,480
That couldn’t stand it

65
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,079
Let him run off

66
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:00,199
To the Guandong Mountains

67
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:05,040
What do you mean “couldn’t stand it”?

68
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,079
Truckload after truckload

69
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:09,920
Even the heavens are disgusted

70
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,720
You set up scams

71
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,720
Kill people at the mine

72
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:20,160
Then demand money from the mine

73
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,720
Compensation scammed from the mine

74
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,800
Split among a few

75
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:26,959
Even the King of Hell is scared

76
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,160
You’ll get what’s coming

77
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:31,439
Pangkuozhi

78
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,279
You really know your stuff

79
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,800
So many trips back and forth

80
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:42,680
You think I, Pangkuozhi

81
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:44,879
Look like a fool?

82
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:50,639
Got it

83
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,600
You want a cut, right?

84
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:53,360
Wouldn’t dare

85
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,639
Afraid to risk my life

86
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,480
I can’t walk your path

87
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,680
Don’t care to

88
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,839
In these times

89
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:03,480
Everyone goes their own way

90
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,240
Know your own worth

91
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:09,839
I never take what’s not mine

92
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,920
If it’s not my business

93
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:15,639
I’m blind to it

94
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:16,800
Don’t see it

95
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,800
Stop wasting words on her

96
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:24,360
Search and you’ll know

97
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:25,600
Let’s go

98
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:37,959
Bagtou

99
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:40,240
There were definitely five when we came in

100
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:10,959
What are you doing?

101
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,480
Nonsense.

102
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,759
I'm looking for someone.

103
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,120
My room

104
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,279
isn't a place you can just enter.

105
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,879
Dakuozhi

106
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:25,399
Did you hide this person in your room?

107
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,040
Darn it.

108
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:29,920
If I hide anything, it's a living person.

109
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,040
Why would I hide your stuff?

110
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,959
That's bad luck.

111
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,279
Dakuozhi

112
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:34,920
If you have the guts,

113
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,680
let us go in and see for ourselves.

114
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,199
You think you can just barge in?

115
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,199
Who do you think you are?

116
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:41,959
No.

117
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:43,120
Dakuozhi

118
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,000
Don't think just because you're a woman

119
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,879
I won't deal with you.

120
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:46,600
What are you doing?

121
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,720
It's raining in the middle of the night.

122
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:54,920
Why aren't you inside drinking?

123
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:55,519
Carrying an oil lamp

124
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,600
What are you doing outside?

125
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,079
Isn't that Jinbagtou?

126
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,560
Pang Siye

127
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:02,800
Why are you here?

128
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,360
If I hadn't come,

129
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,959
you'd be bullying Dakuozhi.

130
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:10,399
Why are you making a fuss at midnight?

131
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:12,800
No.

132
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,120
We lost something

133
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,480
in Dakuozhi's room.

134
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:18,000
We're looking for it.

135
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,560
What did you lose in my room?

136
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,839
Tell Pang Ye.

137
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,000
Pang Ye

138
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:29,120
These two men want to enter my room.

139
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,519
What should we do about this?

140
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,639
If I say it's lost, then it's lost.

141
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,320
Enough.

142
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:41,440
Dakuozhi's room

143
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,480
isn't a place you can just walk into.

144
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,080
Even I haven't been inside.

145
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:51,919
What did you lose?

146
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,720
Is it that important?

147
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,120
Should I go in and check?

148
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,399
You can't go in.

149
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:02,679
Pang Ye

150
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:04,519
If I don't go in, they'll make more trouble.

151
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:05,159
Pang Ye

152
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:06,759
Pang Ye

153
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,000
This room smells nice.

154
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,360
There's nothing here.

155
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:34,559
What did you lose?

156
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:35,759
Pang Ye

157
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,000
Maybe we remembered wrong.

158
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,080
It's not here.

159
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,080
Don't worry.

160
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:41,519
If it's something valuable,

161
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:43,279
I'll call my men

162
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:43,919
to help you look for it.

163
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:44,919
They have guns, too.

164
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,600
Pang Ye

165
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,519
No need to trouble you and your men.

166
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:51,200
You've honored us with your presence.

167
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:53,200
It's not worth much.

168
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,159
Stop.

169
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:01,360
You think you can come and go as you please?

170
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:03,159
Leave whenever you want?

171
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,399
What do you think this place is?

172
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,600
Pang Ye

173
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,919
Two grown men

174
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:13,240
coming into my room in the middle of the night.

175
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:14,879
If word gets out,

176
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,159
how will I live in Songlin Town?

177
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,399
It's like Songlin Town

178
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:20,279
has no rules.

179
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,879
What are you saying?

180
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,519
Songlin Town

181
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:27,039
As long as I'm here,

182
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:30,679
no one will dare bully you, Dakuozhi.

183
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,799
Goodbye.

184
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:54,559
Zhi'er

185
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,559
With all this wind and rain,

186
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,240
why did you come?

187
00:10:58,519 --> 00:10:59,159
I had to.

188
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:01,480
If I hadn't come, would I have run into this?

189
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:05,600
That's Pang Ye for you.

190
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,279
That's a lot.

191
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:12,320
Not much.

192
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,799
If you weren't looking out for me,

193
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:16,159
tonight wouldn't have gone so well.

194
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,480
Would I be this safe?

195
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,720
Zhi'er,

196
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:23,879
you can achieve great things.

197
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:29,879
Guys,

198
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:32,200
around here,

199
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:35,360
the only ones who can take in this valuable thing

200
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,399
are

201
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:39,480
the Puji Ginseng Shop in Songlin Town.

202
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:41,639
No way.

203
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,279
Why not?

204
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:43,879
This old treasure has a strong scent.

205
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,000
It's too strong.

206
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:46,559
I'm worried

207
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,840
that before we even get there,

208
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:48,799
the scent

209
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:49,840
will spread all over Songlin Town

210
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,720
and give us away.

211
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,320
So many people will be watching.

212
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:55,399
We should go somewhere farther.

213
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:56,440
That's right.

214
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:58,799
I heard Songlin Town

215
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,799
is a shady place.

216
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:01,039
How is it shady?

217
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,480
If you can make money in Songlin Town,

218
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,200
you're either dead or not really alive.

219
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:06,120
They'll eat you up and not even spit out the bones.

220
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:10,159
But there's one thing you got wrong.

221
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,759
Songlin Town is surrounded by three mountains

222
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,399
and has a key waterway.

223
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:16,120
People making a living in the border area,

224
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,039
ginseng diggers,

225
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,200
gold seekers,

226
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:19,799
timber rafters,

227
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:21,279
herb gatherers and loggers,

228
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,360
all have to pass through there.

229
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:25,759
All treasures go through there.

230
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:27,120
Gold and silver shipments

231
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,720
also pass through there.

232
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,159
You know that, right?

233
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:30,720
If not Songlin Town,

234
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,240
where else would you go?

235
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:33,159
Mudanjiang.

236
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:33,960
Sounds good.

237
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:34,759
It's a good place.

238
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:35,480
Good for what?

239
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,799
Not to mention trekking through mountains and rivers,

240
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:39,720
there are packs of tigers and wolves on the way.

241
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:41,039
Huge bloody mouths,

242
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,759
iron jaws and sharp teeth.

243
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,000
They'd

244
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:46,480
swallow us whole.

245
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:47,840
Exactly.

246
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:48,639
Right?

247
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:49,679
I think

248
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,960
the boss is right.

249
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:52,639
Right?

250
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,240
It's settled then.

251
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:57,200
I've already decided.

252
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,679
Tomorrow morning,

253
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,320
we head straight to Songlin Town.

254
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:03,159
Deal?

255
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,240
Deal, deal, deal.

256
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,320
Mountain products, mountain products.

257
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:25,399
Weren't there five?

258
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:28,039
We're missing one.

259
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,000
Come on, come on.

260
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,360
Come.

261
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,279
Come here, come here.

262
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:32,200
Come over.

263
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,399
Take a look.

264
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:35,919
Are there five coffins?

265
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:37,240
Yes, yes, yes.

266
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:38,919
I've made all the coffins for you.

267
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,960
There's one left.

268
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,799
Who am I supposed to use it for?

269
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,399
Don't worry.

270
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,840
I'll fill it for you sooner or later.

271
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:45,559
Bah!

272
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,759
That's not a nice thing to say.

273
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:49,879
Who stuffs people into coffins by force?

274
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:50,639
Really?

275
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:53,080
Go and

276
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,840
find the missing person.

277
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,360
The remains can't be exposed.

278
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,679
That's right.

279
00:13:58,919 --> 00:13:59,759
You're right.

280
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,799
I'll go look right now.

281
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:01,879
Go, go, go.

282
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,879
The injuries are too severe.

283
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,159
I can prescribe medicine,

284
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:26,840
but whether he survives

285
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,279
depends on his luck.

286
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:30,879
Doctor He,

287
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,000
please save him.

288
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:34,639
Healing and saving lives

289
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,879
is the essence of medicine.

290
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:37,519
I'll do my best.

291
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:39,240
Also,

292
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:40,559
about his case,

293
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,679
it's an old rule for years.

294
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,679
Once it comes to me, it's settled.

295
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,879
Thank you for your trouble.

296
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:53,000
Take care.

297
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:05,639
Watch your step, everyone.

298
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,480
Got it.

299
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,879
Boss.

300
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,639
Looks like someone fell into a pit.

301
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:21,919
Boss.

302
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,320
We need to keep moving.

303
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,200
Let's go quickly.

304
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,080
We all heard it.

305
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,159
We can't just ignore someone in trouble.

306
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:28,840
If you know who it is, go save them.

307
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:30,039
If you want to help, you go.

308
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:30,720
We're not going.

309
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,799
How about this, Boss.

310
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,080
I'll go check with Xiaogui.

311
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,159
No, wait.

312
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:36,440
If we go, we go together.

313
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:02,440
What's going on?

314
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:07,759
Can you talk?

315
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,000
Mute.

316
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,399
Put him down.

317
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,000
Hurry up.

318
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:25,639
Are you okay?

319
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:30,399
Alright, alright.

320
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:30,919
Get up.

321
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,039
Alright, get up.

322
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,279
I can't handle this.

323
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,639
Enough, get up, stop moving.

324
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,720
Stop moving.

325
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:40,159
If you feel fine,

326
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:41,120
you can go home.

327
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:47,200
If you feel fine,

328
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,679
you can go home.

329
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:54,879
He can't hear.

330
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:05,279
You can't find your way out, right?

331
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:11,240
You're lost, aren't you?

332
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,559
Who knows if he's really lost

333
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:13,920
or just pretending?

334
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:15,240
Don't talk like that.

335
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,799
Leaving him here alone

336
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:23,000
is basically leaving him to die.

337
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,599
Alright then.

338
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:27,200
If you want to come with us,

339
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,400
you can join us.

340
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,200
Get up, get up.

341
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:09,960
You don't remember me?

342
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:13,000
What? You scared me.

343
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,559
You bit it off.

344
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,160
I don't know what you're talking about.

345
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:38,599
Think carefully.

346
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,920
You've got the wrong person.

347
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,079
Since you walked in,

348
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:43,160
I recognized you right away.

349
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,519
I'm absolutely sure.

350
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,839
There are plenty of people who look alike.

351
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,920
I'm just a butcher.

352
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:52,519
I don't know the person you're talking about.

353
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,200
I...

354
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:55,880
I'm telling you,

355
00:18:56,519 --> 00:18:57,960
You'll pay for this.

356
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:00,440
Don't try to scare me.

357
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:03,839
I've only been here two days.

358
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,799
Who made the Japanese

359
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:06,880
attack twice?

360
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:10,480
Right now,

361
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:12,279
you're not even as good as a dog here.

362
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,519
If you keep bothering me,

363
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:15,519
I don't need the Japanese,

364
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,920
I can kill you myself.

365
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:22,279
Let go.

366
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,319
Fire! Fire! Fire!

367
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:47,440
The forest is on fire!

368
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,440
Hurry, get up!

369
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,720
Get up quickly!

370
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,160
There's a fire in the forest over there!

371
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,119
We need to go put out the fire!

372
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,319
Why bother saving it?

373
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,440
How can we stop a wildfire?

374
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:55,519
Let's run, hurry!

375
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,440
What nonsense are you talking about?

376
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,599
We depend on the forest to make a living.

377
00:19:57,599 --> 00:19:58,480
How can we not save it?

378
00:19:58,759 --> 00:19:59,599
Let's go put out the fire!

379
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:00,400
Go, go, go!

380
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,319
Go, go, let's put out the fire!

381
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:07,920
Brother,

382
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:10,599
Wildfires are no joke.

383
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:12,839
If you can't save it, don't force it.

384
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,480
Don't worry.

385
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:15,119
I used to work in the forest too.

386
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:15,799
I know what I'm doing.

387
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,440
Keep an eye on our valuable thing.

388
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,000
Okay.

389
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:10,079
Everyone, wake up.

390
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,680
Wake up.

391
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,000
I'm exhausted.

392
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:27,960
Slept all night.

393
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,000
Slept on and off.

394
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:31,759
Get up, get up.

395
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,640
He's got a fever.

396
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:40,440
Come on, sit up.

397
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:41,920
Stop sleeping, you'll get colder.

398
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,440
Come.

399
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:44,759
It's fine.

400
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,680
Just caught a chill these past days.

401
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:48,599
Lao Si.

402
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:49,440
Bring over the rations.

403
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,000
Let him have some.

404
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,160
The rations are gone.

405
00:21:59,640 --> 00:21:59,960
What?

406
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:00,440
What?

407
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:04,039
Look for them.

408
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,039
They were right here last night.

409
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,000
How are they gone?

410
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,400
Did the rations grow legs?

411
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,160
Did they fly away?

412
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,160
Who got up last night?

413
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,200
What are you saying?

414
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,039
Didn't we all go put out the fire?

415
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:18,480
I'm so anxious I'm confused.

416
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,839
Where's Xiao Yaba?

417
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,000
Yeah, where did he go?

418
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:26,559
I get it now.

419
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,799
That Xiao Yaba...

420
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,359
Waited until we were all exhausted.

421
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:31,319
And dead asleep.

422
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,759
Then took our rations.

423
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,839
Stole all of them.

424
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:36,440
Lao Batou.

425
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:37,319
Where's our ginseng?

426
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,160
It's here.

427
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:41,960
Zhao Lao Si.

428
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:43,160
You were watching the rations.

429
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,119
What do we do now that they're gone?

430
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:44,960
What else can we do?

431
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:45,960
You can eat me, I guess.

432
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:46,799
Then we'll swallow you.

433
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,599
Why is my canteen broken?

434
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:51,279
What?

435
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:54,079
That's just cruel.

436
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,680
Such a heartless bastard.

437
00:22:56,839 --> 00:22:58,279
We shouldn't have saved him.

438
00:22:58,359 --> 00:23:00,440
Stop arguing, what's the point?

439
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,599
Old Mountain God.

440
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,160
We've got no rations left.

441
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:07,839
No water to drink either.

442
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,359
How do we get out of this forest?

443
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,279
We can't just wait here to die.

444
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:12,400
We have to find a way.

445
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,960
Get out of the woods as soon as possible.

446
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,400
Pack up quickly.

447
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:19,319
Pack up.

448
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:22,440
We need to find a way out fast.

449
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:25,359
Leave anything we don't need.

450
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,559
Did you hear that?

451
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,279
Okay, okay.

452
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Someone recognized me.

453
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,240
It's that guy...

454
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,079
The kid with one ear.

455
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:44,119
Right.

456
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:45,920
His ear...

457
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,759
When I broke out,

458
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:47,480
I bit it off.

459
00:23:57,079 --> 00:23:58,200
Find a chance to take him out.

460
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,480
Alright.

461
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:05,200
Go this way.

462
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:17,759
Lao Batou.

463
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:18,599
Who is this?

464
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:20,079
Dongzi, Dongzi!

465
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,200
Dongzi.

466
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:22,400
What's going on?

467
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,119
Put something under him.

468
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,119
Come, let me take a look.

469
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,559
Dongzi.

470
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,440
What's wrong?

471
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:31,799
Batou.

472
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,079
I'm too hungry to walk.

473
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:37,160
Can't walk anymore.

474
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,359
Alright then.

475
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:44,599
Everyone...

476
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:46,519
Let's rest here for a while.

477
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:49,039
Okay, let's rest.

478
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:49,680
Alright.

479
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,519
Rest for a bit.

480
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,160
I'm worried Jinbagtou won't give up.

481
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:42,799
He might come back again.

482
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:44,720
Sorry to make you stay in this cellar.

483
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:45,400
Hide out here for a few days.

484
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:47,200
It's cold at night.

485
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,519
I'll get you another blanket.

486
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:51,119
Don't say that.

487
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
You saved my life.

488
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:55,400
This is nothing compared to that.

489
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,279
I really do feel a bit bad.

490
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,000
That's not what I meant.

491
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,759
The doctor said

492
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,480
your injury is serious.

493
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,200
Just stay here and rest.

494
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,200
Recover from your wounds.

495
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:14,920
We'll talk when you're healed.

496
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,720
Where am I now?

497
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:20,039
Songlin Town.

498
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:23,960
Songlin Town.

499
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,960
If anyone makes it out alive,

500
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:31,759
head straight to Mudanjiang, Songlin Town.

501
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:33,720
Go to Eight Pines north of there.

502
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:35,000
Carve your mark

503
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:36,000
on the tree.

504
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:37,640
This really is Songlin.

505
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:40,000
Don't move.

506
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:41,759
The doctor said

507
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,319
you can't get out of bed yet.

508
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:49,319
Thank you.

509
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,279
I owe it all to you.

510
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,559
You have a strong will to live.

511
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:01,000
Here, take your medicine.

512
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:06,640
Is it hot?

513
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,000
Come on, lean back.

514
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,160
Laobatou

515
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:01,880
I can't go on.

516
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:13,319
Dongzi

517
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,799
Bury him deeper.

518
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,559
Don't let the big animals dig him up.

519
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,519
I can't dig anymore, Laobatou.

520
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:22,559
I really can't dig anymore.

521
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,720
Sorry about this.

522
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,680
Hang in there a bit longer.

523
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:28,480
We’ll reach the water source soon.

524
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:08,680
The construction work here

525
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,720
is up to you.

526
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:10,519
Alright, no problem.

527
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,039
Three people

528
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:24,240
in one group.

529
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,359
One vehicle.

530
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,559
Imperial tools are valuable.

531
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:31,079
If they break,

532
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:32,680
you'll get the whip.

533
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,079
The three of us are a group.

534
00:31:58,039 --> 00:31:58,640
What?

535
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,599
You don't want to?

536
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,319
There's no one else to team up with you.

537
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,759
Can you do this job alone?

538
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:06,359
Hurry up and go.

539
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:26,759
Go on.

540
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:27,839
Why are you just standing here?

541
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:34,599
What are you going to do?

542
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:35,599
Work.

543
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,319
If you dare touch me,

544
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:41,559
the Imperial Army won't spare you.

545
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,680
A Japanese speaks Chinese

546
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,359
pretty fluently.

547
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:46,839
I am actually

548
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:47,720
a translator in the rear.

549
00:32:48,039 --> 00:32:48,880
If it weren't for you,

550
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,160
I wouldn't have to be on the battlefield.

551
00:32:52,119 --> 00:32:53,400
If you dare touch me,

552
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,519
I'll report you.

553
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,640
Report us?

554
00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:02,200
Do you want to try?

555
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,720
Will you report faster,

556
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:05,440
or will we act faster?

557
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:06,960
Shut up.

558
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:07,960
Get to work.

559
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:09,640
Yes.

560
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:02,320
Brother

561
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:06,480
Just now

562
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,239
How could that be?

563
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,519
Get up

564
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:01,360
Get up

565
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:12,360
Erbaozi

566
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,840
I have something to ask you

567
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,519
The brothers have gone so many days

568
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:20,960
without eating

569
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:23,440
Our stomachs are completely empty

570
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,480
How can you still poop?

571
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,079
And quite a lot, too

572
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:32,320
What's going on?

573
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:37,519
Speak

574
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,519
What's going on?

575
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:48,679
You took the brothers' food

576
00:37:48,679 --> 00:37:49,559
Where did you hide it?

577
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,880
The brothers' food

578
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,800
Where did you hide it?

579
00:37:55,519 --> 00:37:56,079
Food

580
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,760
Where's the food?

581
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,440
Move aside

582
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:09,400
Move aside

583
00:38:34,039 --> 00:38:34,599
Food

584
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:35,880
Something to eat

585
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,639
There's food, food, food

586
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,320
What's this?

587
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,360
What's going on?

588
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,280
Food, provisions

589
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,159
Why did you

590
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:55,440
hide the brothers' food?

591
00:38:55,679 --> 00:38:56,679
Why?

592
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,639
If Dongzi

593
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,480
had just a bite to eat

594
00:39:00,519 --> 00:39:02,079
he wouldn't have starved

595
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,320
What's wrong with you?

596
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,679
Xiaogui, wait

597
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:09,800
Don't eat yet

598
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:20,800
Don't eat yet

599
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,320
Don't eat

600
00:39:23,639 --> 00:39:24,199
What's going on?

601
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:25,760
Don't eat

602
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:26,880
Don't eat, don't eat

603
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:27,760
Don't eat

604
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:28,639
Spit it out

605
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:32,840
Zhao Si

606
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:34,400
Zhao Si

607
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:35,519
Zhao Si

608
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:36,679
Zhao Si

609
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:39,519
Mazi

610
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,400
Mazi, Mazi, Mazi

611
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,719
Erbao

612
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,000
You're too cruel

613
00:40:11,719 --> 00:40:14,039
You actually poisoned the food

614
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,599
They're all your brothers

615
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:18,960
Leader

616
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,159
This was actually my backup plan

617
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,760
I just wanted to starve everyone unconscious

618
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,280
and take the ginseng

619
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,000
Didn't expect you'd see through it

620
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:34,679
You're the one who got everyone killed

621
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,800
Not me

622
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,119
You're talking nonsense

623
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:39,599
You're the one who killed them

624
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,840
Why did you do this?

625
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,719
Erbao

626
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:47,480
Wasn't it all for the ginseng?

627
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:49,119
Because of this ginseng

628
00:40:49,159 --> 00:40:51,000
you poisoned everyone

629
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:51,880
Fine

630
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:53,000
Fine

631
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,760
Isn't it all for this ginseng?

632
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,559
Isn't it all for this ginseng?

633
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:03,599
I don't want this ginseng anymore

634
00:41:04,039 --> 00:41:05,320
I'll smash it

635
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:06,440
I'll smash it

636
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,239
Don't let him get away

637
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:18,880
Catch him

638
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:19,639
Bring him back

639
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:20,920
Avenge the brothers

640
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:21,880
Come back

641
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:42,800
Brother

642
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,320
That stab was deep

643
00:41:48,199 --> 00:41:48,800
Brother

644
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,400
Looks like I'm done for

645
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,880
You all need to go

646
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,320
Leave this place

647
00:41:53,559 --> 00:41:54,360
What are you saying?

648
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,000
Even if I have to carry you

649
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,400
I'll carry you out of this forest

650
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:56,920
No

651
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,159
Really can't

652
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,519
We can't get out like this

653
00:41:59,679 --> 00:42:00,920
None of us will survive

654
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:01,559
Brother

655
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:02,519
Wait

656
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,400
Don't move, don't move

657
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:04,360
Don't move

658
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:05,679
You

659
00:42:07,239 --> 00:42:07,800
Brother

660
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:08,920
Wait

661
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,119
Wait

662
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:16,639
Brother,

663
00:42:17,239 --> 00:42:17,840
Take a look.

664
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,159
This is

665
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:21,239
the way out of the mountains from here.

666
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,079
I've drawn it all out.

667
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,920
As long as you follow it correctly,

668
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,039
this area

669
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,280
will take at most three days.

670
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,440
You'll be able to get out.

671
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:33,920
Alright.

672
00:42:35,239 --> 00:42:35,920
Okay, that's enough.

673
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:37,320
Stop talking, stop talking.

674
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:37,880
Uncle,

675
00:42:39,079 --> 00:42:39,760
the ginseng is found.

676
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,760
Hurry and take it out.

677
00:42:42,039 --> 00:42:43,039
Let Laobatou chew it.

678
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,239
This thing can save his life.

679
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,280
No.

680
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:46,360
No.

681
00:42:46,719 --> 00:42:47,719
Even if I die,

682
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,360
I can't harm the ginseng.

683
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,880
Life is more important than ginseng.

684
00:42:56,119 --> 00:42:56,800
Where's the ginseng?
