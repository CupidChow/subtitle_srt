1
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,000
Are you trying to mess with me?

2
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,000
You need to look over here.

3
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,560
Don’t look straight ahead.

4
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,400
Yes, Captain.

5
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,919
Out in the wind and rain every day.

6
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:15,879
Walking this lousy road.

7
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:16,919
Doing this crappy job.

8
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:18,280
Can’t earn a single cent.

9
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,560
Not even getting a penny.

10
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:21,719
Remember this.

11
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:22,680
Did you remember?

12
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,360
Yes, yes.

13
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:26,199
Everyone’s been doing well lately.

14
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,960
I hope you keep it up.

15
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:32,080
Let’s try to finish before winter.

16
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,759
Complete all the work.

17
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,199
In this area.

18
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,439
Within a week.

19
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:39,039
We guarantee all materials will be delivered.

20
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,639
Please rest assured.

21
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:42,520
We promise to finish on time.

22
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,240
Work quickly.

23
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,360
Don’t delay our important business.

24
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,400
Yes.

25
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:49,520
Get out.

26
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,439
Captain Xiao.

27
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:03,800
Your Excellency.

28
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,199
Your Excellency.

29
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:28,199
Eat, eat.

30
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,080
Braised pork knuckle.

31
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,199
From Jufulou.

32
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,159
Roasted duck feet.

33
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,879
From Sijiqing.

34
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:40,560
And blood sausage.

35
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:41,840
Just now.

36
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,159
A freshly slaughtered pig.

37
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,360
That blood.

38
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,199
It was spurting out.

39
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,360
Smelled amazing.

40
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,639
I knew you were here.

41
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,439
So I brought this for you.

42
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,680
A little treat for you.

43
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,639
When you’re back in town soon,

44
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:58,159
I’ll arrange something even better for you.

45
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,879
I know what you mean.

46
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:06,400
And I know what you're thinking.

47
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:08,080
You just want to switch to

48
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,039
a job with more perks.

49
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:11,479
Am I right?

50
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,520
We've always

51
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,879
turned a blind eye

52
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,959
to what you do.

53
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,839
We know everything you've done.

54
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:24,319
You've made quite a bit already.

55
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:25,480
Right?

56
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,720
No, Sir.

57
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,800
What do you mean by that?

58
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:30,600
That's not true.

59
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:31,680
Not at all.

60
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,519
Commander Xiao.

61
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,680
The funds I approved for you,

62
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:37,319
where did you actually spend them?

63
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,959
That money is way more than

64
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,560
what you spent on those few things.

65
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,879
Your work is important.

66
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:47,839
You should know that you are

67
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:49,680
the only Chinese person here

68
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,680
who can

69
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,279
come and go freely.

70
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,519
That shows

71
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:55,639
the Empire's trust in you.

72
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,160
Your performance

73
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:59,439
has always been good.

74
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,519
You haven't made any big mistakes.

75
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:03,000
So,

76
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,680
the Empire will not treat you unfairly.

77
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:09,240
As for

78
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:12,920
some other

79
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:14,160
matters,

80
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,759
don't think too much about them for now.

81
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,279
Understand?

82
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:23,160
Yes.

83
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,279
Today is a good day.

84
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,800
The Imperial Army is showing mercy.

85
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:34,480
All the old, weak, sick, and disabled,

86
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:35,759
the Imperial Army

87
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,720
will send you into the mountains to rest.

88
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,839
This is an opportunity.

89
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,839
What opportunity?

90
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:46,600
We can go into the mountains

91
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,439
and see what they're really doing.

92
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:51,600
Can we trust what the Japanese say?

93
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:53,040
I don't think this is a good thing.

94
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,680
I know.

95
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:56,519
But there's no other way.

96
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:57,920
You.

97
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:00,000
You.

98
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,360
I'll go with you.

99
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:02,720
No.

100
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,399
And you.

101
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:05,959
If something happens,

102
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:06,959
we can't all get caught up in it.

103
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:07,959
Darn it.

104
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:08,480
Listen.

105
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:11,399
Come out.

106
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,920
What do you do?

107
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:27,839
Me?

108
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:29,480
I have diarrhea.

109
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:32,639
It's all runny.

110
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,079
All of it.

111
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,079
It's all water.

112
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,040
You're in such bad shape.

113
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,319
Just go with them.

114
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,199
Please.

115
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,399
I don't want to be picked.

116
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:49,839
All of you,

117
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,279
get on the truck.

118
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,160
The rest of you,

119
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:55,560
turn around.

120
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,279
Go back.

121
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,519
Sir.

122
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,120
Goodbye.

123
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,879
What are their intentions? Tell me.

124
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:41,240
I don't know.

125
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,120
He has a fever.

126
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:47,319
Alright.

127
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:50,160
If you don't talk, I'll report you.

128
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,399
I'll talk.

129
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:55,800
I'll talk.

130
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,439
They're not going there to rest at all.

131
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,360
They're being sent in as forced laborers.

132
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:07,079
They're being sent to their deaths.

133
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:09,120
To die.

134
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,800
What do you mean, forced laborers?

135
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:13,279
It's them.

136
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:14,000
They pick out

137
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,079
those who can't work anymore.

138
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,319
They make them carry explosives.

139
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:19,120
Send them in to blast the mountain.

140
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:21,519
They promise

141
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,399
if they survive and come out,

142
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:25,879
they'll be given a way out.

143
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:28,920
But some refuse to go in.

144
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:31,000
Then they point guns

145
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,480
at them.

146
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,080
Force them to go in.

147
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,679
How is that sending them to die?

148
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,320
The fuse is way too short.

149
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,000
Once it's lit,

150
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:43,240
they go in.

151
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,200
No one has ever come out alive.

152
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,720
You can't go.

153
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,240
What are you doing?

154
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,240
You can't go.

155
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:58,799
Let me go.

156
00:08:58,799 --> 00:08:59,480
You can't go.

157
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,480
If you go now, you're not helping him.

158
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:03,720
You're putting him in danger.

159
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:06,720
Calm down first.

160
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,039
Let's think of a solution together.

161
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,799
What's wrong, sir?

162
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:26,679
Are you blind?

163
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,879
You spat on my shoes.

164
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,720
Forget it.

165
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:32,679
Get back to work.

166
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,039
Sir.

167
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,039
Are you blind?

168
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:40,960
These shoes of mine

169
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,480
are made of imported Japanese leather.

170
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,759
Can you afford to pay for them?

171
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:46,039
My eyes are small,

172
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:48,320
but yours are even smaller.

173
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:50,320
Hit him.

174
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:51,200
Beat him hard.

175
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:56,879
Drag him over there.

176
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:57,559
Come.

177
00:09:58,279 --> 00:09:58,759
Let's go.

178
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:07,840
Useless, useless, useless.

179
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:19,200
Bro.

180
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,360
Now you call me bro?

181
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,320
You still recognize me?

182
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,360
Bro, that's not it.

183
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,039
You went too far.

184
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:31,759
Too far?

185
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,320
People like you need to be dealt with harshly.

186
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,519
Why did you go to the back mountain?

187
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,919
You think

188
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,399
the Japanese really let you

189
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:44,240
rest here?

190
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,159
Tell me the truth.

191
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,279
Why did you go?

192
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,279
I don't know.

193
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,519
The Japanese told me to go.

194
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,960
Stop lying, you don't know?

195
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:55,559
Lying through your teeth.

196
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,679
Tell me.

197
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:58,080
How did you end up here?

198
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,559
I was caught as a vagrant.

199
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:01,840
Are you a vagrant or a prisoner?

200
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:03,159
A vagrant, really a vagrant.

201
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:07,279
So this is what you've come to.

202
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,960
Back then you split from me.

203
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:10,799
At that time,

204
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,440
Well, well.

205
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:14,559
Talking to me about nation

206
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,799
and righteousness.

207
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,720
So where's your nation now?

208
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,320
Where's your righteousness?

209
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:22,440
Pointing to the sky and the ground,

210
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,519
beating your chest, saying

211
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,279
you'd drive the Japanese out.

212
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:26,720
Did you drive them out?

213
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,039
You brag without thinking.

214
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:32,919
If I

215
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:34,759
didn't care about your parents,

216
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:36,200
I wouldn't bother with you.

217
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:39,120
Speaking of your parents,

218
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,480
if it weren't for me,

219
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,840
they'd have died long ago.

220
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:45,480
Bro.

221
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,519
How are my parents now?

222
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,519
You still remember you have parents?

223
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:04,840
Bro

224
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,200
I was wrong

225
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:10,399
Really

226
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,399
I

227
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:14,399
I want to go home

228
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,320
I really want to go home

229
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,840
Can you help me?

230
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,799
You’ve got some nerve

231
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,840
Back then

232
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,279
When I asked you for help

233
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,200
Did you help?

234
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,000
You just ran off

235
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:28,360
You

236
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,399
You’re the typical kind

237
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:30,720
Deny after benefiting

238
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,639
Of that crowd

239
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:32,879
I was wrong, bro

240
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,639
I really was wrong

241
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:35,720
Truly wrong

242
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:40,440
Anyway

243
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,279
The Japanese are about to hold the Autumn Festival

244
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,159
On that day

245
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:48,240
I’ll definitely drive the car there

246
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,480
I’ll for sure drive there

247
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,559
After it’s over

248
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,240
I’ll definitely drive home

249
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:56,440
You think you can go home?

250
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:59,720
Keep dreaming

251
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:03,519
Xiao Dunzi

252
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:04,159
Here

253
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:05,799
Take him away

254
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:06,399
Yes

255
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:09,720
Slow down, Captain

256
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:14,360
Let’s go

257
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,679
Tofu

258
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,919
Cabbage

259
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:29,399
Every day you

260
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:30,720
Make it way too fancy

261
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:32,320
Thanks

262
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,399
Enough, stop thanking me

263
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,919
You thank me every day

264
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,559
Your “thanks”

265
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,320
Is about to clog my ears

266
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,279
Completely blocked

267
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:42,759
What happened in town?

268
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,000
Boss Zhu from the fur shop

269
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:47,159
Hid three resistance fighters

270
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,440
The Japanese came looking

271
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:51,039
Killed them all

272
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:00,120
When it gets dark

273
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,840
I’ll leave too

274
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,440
Even the King of Hell doesn’t want

275
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,320
Victims

276
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,080
Why are you afraid of the Japanese?

277
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,639
I’m not afraid of the Japanese

278
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,799
I’m afraid of causing you trouble

279
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,039
The Japanese rarely come to this town

280
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,919
Boss Zhu got in trouble

281
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,679
Someone tipped off the Japanese

282
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,799
How do you know?

283
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,000
Don’t ask about that

284
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,440
Anyway

285
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:40,799
It was Boss Zhu

286
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,279
He offended You Shilong

287
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,320
You Shilong

288
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,600
Went to the Japanese

289
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,480
And ratted out the fur shop

290
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:50,519
From now on in Songlin Town

291
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,159
There will never be

292
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,960
A shop like Xinglong Fur again

293
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:55,399
You Shilong

294
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,559
Boss You, You Shilong

295
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:01,919
Right

296
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,279
What’s his background?

297
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,000
He’s around here

298
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:06,799
A notorious figure in the underworld

299
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,320
Fierce and ruthless

300
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,200
Where is he?

301
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:16,720
How would I know?

302
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,519
What does he look like?

303
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,840
How would I know?

304
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:26,200
I really don’t know

305
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:28,200
I’ve never seen him

306
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:31,919
Probably no one in this town

307
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,360
Has ever seen him

308
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:36,799
A living person no one’s seen

309
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,159
I heard from old customers

310
00:15:41,559 --> 00:15:42,600
Anyone who’s seen him

311
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:45,000
Is dead

312
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:50,919
Enough

313
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:52,679
Stop overthinking

314
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,039
Even if you had three heads and six arms

315
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:56,159
You couldn’t beat him

316
00:15:57,799 --> 00:15:59,000
If you survive

317
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,960
Just live your life

318
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,159
But if he stays alive

319
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:06,960
More people will die

320
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:15,480
What does it have to do with you?

321
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,440
You’re asking for trouble.

322
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,519
I never should’ve saved you back then.

323
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:23,919
But you did save me anyway.

324
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:27,200
Fine, I’ll admit I was wrong.

325
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,519
Let’s eat.

326
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,840
Even food can’t shut you up.

327
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:50,120
No more rice for the pot today.

328
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,200
This month,

329
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,000
these victims,

330
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,240
aren’t done yet?

331
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,000
Boss You,

332
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:57,840
All of Guandong Mountain is yours.

333
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:00,039
You can eat whatever you want.

334
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,720
Hurry up.

335
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:04,880
Everyone at the table is starving.

336
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:45,960
What are you looking at?

337
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,200
Why did you come back?

338
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:53,079
I thought you wouldn’t make it back.

339
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,759
Something unexpected happened.

340
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,119
It’s good you’re back, that’s what matters.

341
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:01,359
What happened to your face?

342
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,720
Did someone hit you?

343
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,039
Who did it?

344
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,039
Don’t worry about who did it.

345
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:12,119
But it was worth getting hit.

346
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:21,640
Don't speak.

347
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,799
I won't say anything.

348
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,799
If you want money, I have money.

349
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:25,200
Just let me live.

350
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,200
We're ginseng diggers.

351
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
We've brought out a treasure.

352
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,039
We want to sell it here.

353
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,200
So that's what's going on.

354
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,440
You scared me to death.

355
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,400
No, it's just... this knife...

356
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,920
It's mainly about this herb.

357
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,039
The smell is too strong.

358
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:49,839
Sorry to disturb you so late.

359
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:51,039
Please forgive us.

360
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:55,640
I have to take a look at it, right?

361
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,640
This is a real treasure.

362
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,240
I can't afford to take it.

363
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,640
Why don't you name your price first?

364
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,480
If I offer too little, we'll be enemies.

365
00:20:57,119 --> 00:20:58,880
If it's too high, I can't afford it either.

366
00:20:59,359 --> 00:20:59,759
Well...

367
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:01,880
Maybe it's better not to name a price.

368
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:05,200
Then in this town,

369
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:07,119
who could afford it?

370
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:08,640
The ones who run the bank.

371
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:11,240
The gold shop owners, the pawnshop owners.

372
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:12,640
They all have plenty of money.

373
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:14,880
But even they

374
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,119
need me to appraise it.

375
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,519
If you're not worried

376
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:19,599
about showing this treasure around,

377
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,359
I can help you ask around.

378
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:25,720
Alright.

379
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:28,160
We'll leave it to you then.

380
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:29,759
No problem, I'll handle it.

381
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:32,960
This really is a treasure.

382
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,200
So...

383
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:36,960
But if I find something out,

384
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:37,640
how

385
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,000
do I contact you?

386
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:43,359
We'll come find you.

387
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:44,720
Your hand, your hand.

388
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:45,839
Alright.

389
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,359
Make sure you wrap it up well.

390
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:51,440
Uncle.

391
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,799
From what Mr. Park said,

392
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,119
this ginseng won't sell in just a day or two.

393
00:21:56,119 --> 00:21:57,079
It'll take time to find a buyer.

394
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,799
This treasure

395
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,400
is really hard to handle.

396
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,480
We need to be patient.

397
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,599
Stay patient.

398
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,839
Hurry up, hurry up!

399
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,400
The Japanese are about to hold the Autumn Festival.

400
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:24,000
I want the cart driven over there.

401
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:39,000
Move quickly!

402
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,279
What's up with that Korean guy?

403
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:53,640
I...

404
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,519
I think

405
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,359
he can be trusted.

406
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,160
We can be upfront with him.

407
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,279
Alright.

408
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,079
Then go now

409
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:07,039
and win him over.

410
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:09,200
I need everyone's help with something.

411
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,000
Let me tell you something.

412
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,640
How did your friend get back?

413
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:28,119
Him?

414
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,039
He's really capable.

415
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,319
This is nothing for him.

416
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:34,079
I'll tell you more about it later.

417
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:36,119
I could tell long ago

418
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:37,440
you guys aren't ordinary folks.

419
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:39,319
What do you really do?

420
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,759
I don't want to ask.

421
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:43,240
Go ahead.

422
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,720
What do you need from me?

423
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,039
You seem pretty tough too.

424
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,880
Daring to go against the Japanese.

425
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,559
I won't beat around the bush.

426
00:23:54,759 --> 00:23:55,960
Do you want to escape?

427
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:00,160
I do.

428
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,000
And I have to take my brothers

429
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:02,720
all out with me.

430
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:03,839
Alright.

431
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:08,119
We actually need your help.

432
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:12,799
My name is Li Zhenghao.

433
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,480
What should I call you?

434
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:16,440
I'm Wan Fuqing.

435
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,440
The boss is back! Open the door!

436
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,359
What’s wrong?

437
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,400
That bastard Liu Heihu,

438
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,279
has no sense of decency.

439
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,720
He came onto our turf

440
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,680
to do business, didn’t he?

441
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,400
Isn’t he just working for the Japanese?

442
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,480
He’s just got better gear than us.

443
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,160
Third Bro,

444
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:17,799
are you okay?

445
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,079
I’ll live.

446
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:22,680
You,

447
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,640
take him back to his room. No one touches him.

448
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:39,200
Hold him down.

449
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:44,559
Hang in there, Third Bro.

450
00:25:45,319 --> 00:25:46,680
How old are you, Third Boss?

451
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,200
Th-thirty.

452
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:51,519
Want to get married?

453
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:53,440
Yeah.

454
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:55,680
Hang in there, San’er.

455
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,240
I do.

456
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,000
I do.

457
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,519
Stay strong.

458
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:06,319
Hold on, don’t move.

459
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,279
Hang in there.

460
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:11,799
It’s done, it’s done.

461
00:26:11,799 --> 00:26:12,200
Herbs.

462
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:17,200
It’s done, it’s done.

463
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,519
San’er, it’s over.

464
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,079
It’s done, it’s done.

465
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,799
Give him some more.

466
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:24,400
It’s done, it’s done.

467
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:25,920
Okay.

468
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,079
It’s done, it’s done.

469
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:33,799
Alright, alright.

470
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:34,559
Alright, alright, alright.

471
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,039
It’s done, it’s done, it’s done.

472
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,000
Is that okay?

473
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:38,920
It’s done.

474
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:39,839
It’s done.

475
00:26:40,279 --> 00:26:41,039
It’s done, it’s done, it’s done.

476
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,039
What happened?

477
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,119
Th-thank you, thank you.

478
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,720
You’re all so stubborn.

479
00:26:58,519 --> 00:26:59,759
All of you, get over here and work!

480
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:03,160
Watch your tone.

481
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:04,960
You’re not listening, are you?

482
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,000
When Major Fujimoto gets here,

483
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:10,640
none of you will survive.

484
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:14,319
I’ll ask one last time.

485
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:16,680
Can you work or not?

486
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,039
You led everyone to strike.

487
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,920
Once things get chaotic here,

488
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:26,720
I’ll use the chaos to scout around.

489
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:03,039
Yes.

490
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:06,920
The other projects are going smoothly.

491
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:09,680
Why is it only your people

492
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,799
who are on hunger strike and refusing to work?

493
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,960
I have failed. Please punish me, sir.

494
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:18,839
Yes.

495
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,880
Everyone has worked hard.

496
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,799
If you have any complaints,

497
00:28:26,359 --> 00:28:27,480
please tell me.

498
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,359
I will resolve them for you.

499
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:35,559
Don’t move, I’ll handle it.

500
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:42,240
Every day,

501
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:44,759
we start working as soon as we wake up.

502
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:46,839
The food

503
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,480
is all spoiled.

504
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:49,599
Moldy bread.

505
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:50,920
And

506
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:52,519
the portions aren’t enough.

507
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:53,680
All we get to drink

508
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,000
is bland vegetable soup without salt.

509
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,880
Even when we want water,

510
00:28:59,279 --> 00:28:59,960
we’re not given any.

511
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,119
Many people have fallen ill.

512
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:04,920
If this continues,

513
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:06,960
we won’t be able to finish the work.

514
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,640
Winter is coming soon.

515
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,279
We’re not doing this for ourselves.

516
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:14,880
We want to finish the project quickly.

517
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,640
You’re the representative of everyone.

518
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,319
We have no representative.

519
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,799
We just don’t want to eat pig food anymore.

520
00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:22,839
We want to eat

521
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:24,319
real food, food for people.

522
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,039
Does everyone here

523
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:29,359
think the food is a problem?

524
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,480
You tell me.

525
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,079
How is our food?

526
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:49,880
Major, I have a question.

527
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:51,279
Go ahead.

528
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:54,359
I am also a subject of the Emperor.

529
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,960
Why am I treated

530
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,680
the same as these Chinese?

531
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:04,000
You broke military rules.

532
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:07,440
You are not worthy to be Japanese.

533
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:09,680
Long live the Emperor!

534
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:11,640
Long live the Emperor!

535
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,000
Fine.

536
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:20,160
Then stay here

537
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,720
and, by military tradition,

538
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:26,079
perform seppuku in public.

539
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:28,799
How about it?

540
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:31,880
Do you dare?

541
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,880
This project

542
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:50,160
must be finished before winter.

543
00:30:51,079 --> 00:30:52,079
Your requests

544
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:54,000
will be improved immediately.

545
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,599
Workers serving the Empire

546
00:30:58,599 --> 00:30:59,839
should be treated well.

547
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,160
But

548
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,920
the two of you who led this

549
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,279
must be punished.

550
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,440
Now,

551
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:16,440
can everyone get back to work?

552
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,680
Japanese

553
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:40,680
Let’s have a chat.

554
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:42,960
You’re so quiet.

555
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,519
I thought you’d suffocated.

556
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:47,400
Are you

557
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,759
unable to hear me?

558
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:50,359
Put your left ear

559
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,160
against the barrel.

560
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,440
Then you’ll hear me.

561
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:55,400
My ear’s injured, not deaf.

562
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,759
I know you’re not deaf.

563
00:31:57,759 --> 00:31:59,440
No need to shout.

564
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,759
Earlier today,

565
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,519
what did you say to them?

566
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,279
How come, just like me,

567
00:32:06,359 --> 00:32:07,680
you ended up in a barrel too?

568
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,839
This has nothing to do with you.

569
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:12,000
You’re Chinese.

570
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:14,039
We’re not the same.

571
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:15,119
Right.

572
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:16,440
We’re different.

573
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,000
Your barrel’s bigger than mine.

574
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,599
You’ve got a warm bed inside.

575
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:23,400
And rice balls from your mom.

576
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:25,200
Eat slowly.

577
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,119
Don’t choke.

578
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:27,519
Stop talking.

579
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,119
It’s because of you people

580
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:32,039
that I suffer this humiliation.

581
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:33,799
I can’t go home.

582
00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:34,839
See my Mariko.

583
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:37,160
That’s not my fault.

584
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:39,400
Blame your Emperor if you must.

585
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:40,880
If not for him,

586
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:42,200
would there be this war?

587
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,079
Without this war,

588
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,279
would we even meet?

589
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:46,599
It’s kill or be killed, isn’t it?

590
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,200
If it were peaceful times,

591
00:32:48,279 --> 00:32:49,359
I’d just eat pig’s ear.

592
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,680
Why would I bite yours?

593
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:54,079
Now it’s settled.

594
00:32:55,319 --> 00:32:56,039
You and I

595
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,559
are both locked up in this labor camp.

596
00:32:58,279 --> 00:32:59,799
Who knows if we’ll see tomorrow’s sun.

597
00:32:59,799 --> 00:33:00,599
Nothing’s certain.

598
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,319
If you want to survive,

599
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,000
you’d better stick with me.

600
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,000
Trusting your Emperor won’t help.

601
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,759
You’d better trust me instead.

602
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:08,160
Without me,

603
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,480
you’d have been dumped in the mountains.

604
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,039
From now on, I’m your father.

605
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:12,359
Got it?

606
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,480
See?

607
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:17,880
Don’t listen to your father,

608
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,240
and you get a lump on your head.

609
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:20,440
Serves you right.

610
00:33:20,759 --> 00:33:21,400
Shut up.

611
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,559
As long as it didn't catch fire, it's fine.

612
00:34:04,599 --> 00:34:05,039
Thanks.

613
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:10,880
Second Brother.

614
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:11,920
It's pitch dark.

615
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:12,599
Hurry up and walk them out.

616
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,119
Sister Hua.

617
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:18,519
Let me walk you out.

618
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,400
It's just a few steps, no need.

619
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,159
Sister Hua.

620
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,920
Look at our village.

621
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,119
Just a bunch of rough men.

622
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,320
None of us know how to say nice things.

623
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,480
But,

624
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,159
we're truly grateful to you.

625
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,320
You saved Third Brother.

626
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,119
Third Brother's had a tough life too.

627
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,440
You've all treated me well too.

628
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,920
We understand each other.

629
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:18,760
Get down.

630
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:19,599
Bastard.

631
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,559
Bastard.

632
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:25,639
Get out.

633
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:26,519
Get out.

634
00:35:27,239 --> 00:35:27,800
Hurry up.

635
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,400
Hurry up.

636
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,159
Get down.

637
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:31,679
Quick.

638
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,840
Get out, move faster.

639
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:40,119
Move! Move, you bastard!

640
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,400
You've all worked hard these days.

641
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:49,280
As you can see,

642
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,559
we've brought in another group.

643
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,639
They'll be replacing you.

644
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,079
Doing the hardest jobs.

645
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:58,519
And you

646
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,760
can take a break.

647
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,840
Do some lighter work.

648
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,400
See this land?

649
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,719
Starting today,

650
00:36:09,719 --> 00:36:11,039
you're in charge of digging here.

651
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,719
Dig a big pit.

652
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:20,599
Everyone, get to work.

653
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:25,159
Hurry, hurry!

654
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:34,559
Isn't it that ginseng you mentioned?

655
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:35,880
Is it really that precious?

656
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,159
Boss Jin,

657
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,079
After all these years,

658
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,159
don't you trust my eyes?

659
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:44,239
I'm telling you,

660
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,639
there are kinds you've never seen.

661
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,159
Can't say I've never seen them,

662
00:36:49,639 --> 00:36:51,639
just can't remember the last time.

663
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,920
That was ages ago.

664
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,000
Boss Park,

665
00:36:56,679 --> 00:36:57,840
stop dragging it out.

666
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,480
Take out the treasure.

667
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,079
Show us brothers

668
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:01,800
so we can see it.

669
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:02,920
Right?

670
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,320
If I

671
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,840
bring out that ginseng,

672
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,639
it'll knock you all off your feet.

673
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,440
You're making it sound more mysterious.

674
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,400
Even if it's a big treasure,

675
00:37:12,519 --> 00:37:14,519
the price is sky-high.

676
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:16,199
Sky-high is fine,

677
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:18,559
just worried it might cost your life.

678
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:20,800
You might get it,

679
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,719
but you might not keep it.

680
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:24,679
That's what I think too.

681
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,000
That's why I called you all here.

682
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,440
Here in Songlin Town,

683
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:30,920
if you guys don't take it,

684
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,239
no one else can.

685
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,280
That's true.

686
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,559
Move faster.

687
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:52,039
I heard

688
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,559
the Japanese bury people alive.

689
00:37:55,719 --> 00:37:57,239
They make you dig your own grave.

690
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:01,360
This pit is already deeper than a man.

691
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,039
Old Tang,

692
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,239
today, the two of us

693
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:07,360
probably won't make it.

694
00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:12,960
Dying like this feels humiliating.

695
00:38:17,159 --> 00:38:18,559
I want to fight them.

696
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,440
What's the rush?

697
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,079
They're digging such a big pit,

698
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:30,159
they won't bury just these people.

699
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:32,519
There must be others from the labor camps.

700
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:37,880
You mean

701
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,199
we still have a chance to escape?

702
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,760
I'm talking to you, hurry up!

703
00:39:02,679 --> 00:39:03,719
Stop looking around.

704
00:39:04,119 --> 00:39:05,159
Get to work.

705
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,639
I heard soon

706
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:10,960
it's your Autumn Festival.

707
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:13,280
Yeah.

708
00:39:16,039 --> 00:39:17,119
Any special customs?

709
00:39:18,519 --> 00:39:19,280
Customs.

710
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,199
Eat rice cakes.

711
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:30,800
Will there be mass killings?

712
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,760
On your country's festival,

713
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:37,559
do you kill people?

714
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,800
Got it.

715
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,880
They're human moles.

716
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:36,880
Causing trouble at midnight.

717
00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:40,119
As soon as their legs heal a bit,

718
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:41,199
they start wandering everywhere.

719
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,079
Did a fox lure you in?

720
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,199
You barely managed to survive.

721
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,320
Liu Biaozi and Niqiu.

722
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,599
It's fine if they don't come for you.

723
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,360
Why are you provoking them instead?

724
00:40:53,239 --> 00:40:54,639
I've figured this out myself.

725
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,519
What is it?

726
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:57,719
I'm not one of them.

727
00:40:57,719 --> 00:40:58,960
Was I in the first batch they brought in?

728
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:03,880
No.

729
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,119
Jin Batou and Niqiu.

730
00:41:05,159 --> 00:41:06,280
How often do they come to your shop?

731
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,559
About once a month.

732
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,559
When someone dies at the mine, they need coffins.

733
00:41:15,079 --> 00:41:16,519
Old Walnut delivers them directly.

734
00:41:16,519 --> 00:41:18,000
Why not just bury them on the spot?

735
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:20,320
Why insist on

736
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,920
transporting the bodies to Songlin Town?

737
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,559
Put them in coffins and then bring them back?

738
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:26,199
So this is a regular business.

739
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:29,039
Every month, someone dies at the mine.

740
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,440
They take the bodies to town.

741
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,880
They profit off the victims.

742
00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:37,159
The money they swindle

743
00:41:37,159 --> 00:41:38,719
Jin Batou, Niqiu, and You Shilong

744
00:41:38,719 --> 00:41:39,400
split it three ways.

745
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:40,719
This month,

746
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,639
these victims

747
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,320
aren't "ready" yet?

748
00:41:44,519 --> 00:41:45,719
If no one dies at the mine,

749
00:41:45,719 --> 00:41:46,679
You Shilong pushes them.

750
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,360
They kill a few themselves.

751
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,039
To make victims.

752
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,920
There was a cave-in.

753
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,800
Am I wrong?

754
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:11,239
You're pretty sharp.

755
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,280
Let me tell you,

756
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,400
this has nothing to do with you.

757
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,119
Nothing to do with me?

758
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:21,639
How could it have nothing to do with me?

759
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:24,719
Listen,

760
00:42:25,639 --> 00:42:27,519
now it's not just about my own revenge.

761
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:29,599
These three bastards

762
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,159
must die.
