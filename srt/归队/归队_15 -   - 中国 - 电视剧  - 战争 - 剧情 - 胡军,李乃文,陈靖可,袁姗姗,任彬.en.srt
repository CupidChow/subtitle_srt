1
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,159
Alright, that's settled then.

2
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,759
Okay, thank you, Boss Gao.

3
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,680
I'm heading out now.

4
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:39,199
Take care on the road.

5
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:39,919
Alright.

6
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,319
You head back.

7
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:01,840
Brothers,

8
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,360
This time, Liu Heihu

9
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,560
I've finally put him in his place.

10
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:05,800
He's completely tamed now.

11
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,479
Hua'er,

12
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:08,520
Third Brother,

13
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:09,680
Don't move, don't move.

14
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,520
Second Brother,

15
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:11,280
What are you doing?

16
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:13,319
Let's go.

17
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:27,360
What are you doing?

18
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,919
You two little rats planning to betray us?

19
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,520
Little White Horse,

20
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,479
We've made up our minds.

21
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:37,680
We're going down the mountain to fight the Japs.

22
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,960
Fight the Japs.

23
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:45,960
Are you in or not?

24
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:48,199
What if I say no?

25
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,039
If you don't,

26
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,240
I'll take your child

27
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,039
and leave with the brothers.

28
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:06,319
You'll never see them again.

29
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,600
I know.

30
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,560
You’re close with my brothers.

31
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:42,279
They all treat you well.

32
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,319
Because you saved their lives.

33
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:45,480
Right?

34
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:48,199
But Hua,

35
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,600
There’s an order to these things.

36
00:04:53,079 --> 00:04:54,639
I’ve saved their lives too.

37
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:56,839
And they’ve saved mine.

38
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,399
Do you know what that means?

39
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:00,680
It means we’re all tied together,

40
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,959
brothers bound by life and death.

41
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:05,160
Would they listen to you?

42
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:07,360
Didn’t you say

43
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,120
what’s yours is mine?

44
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,199
I meant our family.

45
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,879
It’s not the same in the gang.

46
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:23,040
Me, Xiao Baima,

47
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:24,600
I’m totally bewitched by you.

48
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,600
But in such a big gang,

49
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,680
I’m still a leader.

50
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:29,920
Isn’t that right?

51
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:33,279
You’re getting bold.

52
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:34,759
You want to turn them against me?

53
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,879
Can’t warm a cold heart, huh?

54
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,279
No.

55
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:42,519
No.

56
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,759
So the sister-in-law’s an outsider?

57
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:44,560
Not just those two.

58
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,639
Even you.

59
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,480
Anything else you want to say?

60
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,000
Can I just laugh?

61
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:04,079
What do you mean?

62
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,560
A bunch of men,

63
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:10,439
food and drink whenever you want,

64
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,000
people and guns at your disposal,

65
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,120
watching the Japs

66
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,319
on our turf

67
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,439
burn, kill, and loot,

68
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,360
yet you hide all day like turtles.

69
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,360
When you see the Japs,

70
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:20,920
you run for the hills with your tails between your legs.

71
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:22,279
Are you still men?

72
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:23,720
Do you deserve it?

73
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:24,800
Do you deserve it?

74
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:29,160
Anti-Japanese Allied Forces fighters,

75
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:31,600
no armor, no food for tomorrow,

76
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,199
carrying broken guns,

77
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,600
wielding big knives to fight the Japs,

78
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:36,079
even women dare to kill the enemy,

79
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,199
and die with bodies torn apart.

80
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,600
That’s what it means to be Chinese.

81
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,519
What are you?

82
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,720
Good-for-nothings.

83
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:43,600
A bunch of cowards.

84
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,079
What?

85
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:46,000
You never stop.

86
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,600
I can’t handle you today.

87
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:51,079
Believe it or not,

88
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,120
if you say one more word,

89
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:53,040
I swear today

90
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,000
I’ll shoot you right here.

91
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:55,120
Big Brother, Big Brother!

92
00:06:58,199 --> 00:06:58,560
Shoot!

93
00:06:59,439 --> 00:06:59,920
Shoot!

94
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:00,480
Sister-in-law.

95
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,519
Shoot today.

96
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,879
I want the kid to see

97
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,279
you don’t dare kill the Japs,

98
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,360
but you dare kill the kid’s own father.

99
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:32,120
What are you doing? What are you doing?

100
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:37,879
I’m a grown man,

101
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,279
always bullied by a woman like you.

102
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:44,920
Bullied by you.

103
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:50,600
Didn’t I say it?

104
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,839
Let me think.

105
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,439
That forehead,

106
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:57,560
you just had a gun pressed against it.

107
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,199
Did it hurt?

108
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:01,960
Stop.

109
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:03,559
What are you doing?

110
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,399
You walk pretty quietly.

111
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,000
I didn’t even hear you.

112
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:09,960
Uncle.

113
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:10,960
Uncle.

114
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,039
You’re pretty alert.

115
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,000
Not bad, not bad.

116
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,039
Here, take it slow, Uncle.

117
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:16,879
Is everyone doing well?

118
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,799
We’re good, Uncle.

119
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:18,240
Good.

120
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:18,840
Take it easy.

121
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,480
Uncle’s back.

122
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,320
Uncle, Uncle.

123
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,600
Uncle’s back, Uncle’s back.

124
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,639
He’s back, he’s back.

125
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,639
Uncle, you’re back.

126
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:33,480
Back, back.

127
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:35,799
Uncle.

128
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:37,480
Gui’er.

129
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,120
You finally made it back.

130
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:41,399
What happened?

131
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:43,399
A hunter came by a couple days ago.

132
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:44,639
He said he had a way.

133
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:45,639
He could find our people.

134
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,440
But I think he’s a spy.

135
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:49,000
Where is he?

136
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:49,799
We’re watching him.

137
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:53,879
I could smell it from far away.

138
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,519
This tobacco smells great.

139
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,720
You’ve got a sharp nose.

140
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:00,720
How about it?

141
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,840
Let me have a puff.

142
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:08,559
Only you guys

143
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,120
aren’t afraid of bugs and mosquitoes.

144
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,240
Always heading into the woods.

145
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,559
Makes it easy for me to find you.

146
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:16,159
Why are you looking for us?

147
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,120
Aren’t you with the Anti-Japanese Allied Forces?

148
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,440
Just because you say so?

149
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:23,960
Well, this is something.

150
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:30,000
No birds fly in the dead of winter.

151
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:36,240
Sparrows huddle together in the snow.

152
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,440
I was sent by Squad Leader Zhao.

153
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:47,639
To find our people.

154
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:49,000
Already from me,

155
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,159
four people have been picked up.

156
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,960
So Squad Leader Zhao,

157
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,639
how often does he come looking for you?

158
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:56,360
That’s hard to say.

159
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,519
The longest time

160
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,519
was two months.

161
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,159
Old Brother.

162
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:03,879
You’ve really had it tough.

163
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,440
I’m getting old.

164
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,600
Not much use anymore.

165
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,480
But I can still help out.

166
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:09,879
Do my part.

167
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:11,559
Fight the Japs.

168
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,879
Count me in.

169
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:13,799
Right.

170
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,159
Count me in.

171
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:46,120
Uncle

172
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,360
Uncle

173
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:52,120
How is it going?

174
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:53,879
No problem.

175
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:55,080
They're one of us.

176
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,879
Then we can find our main force.

177
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,759
There's more good news.

178
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:01,000
Three more joined at Eight Pine Trees.

179
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,000
Who are they?

180
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:04,440
Fu Qing, Yun Hu, De Yuan.

181
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:06,320
Really, Uncle?

182
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:10,840
They're definitely in Songlin Town.

183
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:11,600
Waiting for us.

184
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,080
I think so too.

185
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,720
That's why I was there.

186
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:16,879
Looked for them for days.

187
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:17,919
Couldn't find them.

188
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:21,519
When we have time,

189
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:23,120
let's go wait in Songlin Town.

190
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,759
We'll run into them sooner or later.

191
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,879
I'm thinking now,

192
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:30,600
we need to move.

193
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,360
Where to?

194
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,399
Here's the plan.

195
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:35,919
You take everyone

196
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,320
and go with the old hunter first.

197
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,799
Wait at his place.

198
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:40,320
Our people

199
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,679
Whenever they contact us,

200
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,720
We can't say, just have to wait.

201
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:45,279
If they show up,

202
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:47,080
you lead everyone back to the unit.

203
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:49,240
Uncle, what about you?

204
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:51,840
I have to go to Onion Mountain to find Hua'er.

205
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:02,919
Old Platoon Leader

206
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,080
Come on, fill the glasses!

207
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,720
Great wine, great wine!

208
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:08,840
So happy!

209
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:11,399
Uncle's about to speak, stop drinking.

210
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:12,720
Brothers,

211
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,960
this bowl of wine

212
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,200
I toast to all of you.

213
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:19,480
Stand up, get up, stand up!

214
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:23,200
You all joining our ranks

215
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,600
makes my heart

216
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,039
burn with pride.

217
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:29,879
We just want

218
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:31,559
to show the Japs

219
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,840
we have people,

220
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:36,360
and we have backbone.

221
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:37,559
We Chinese

222
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:39,759
can't be beaten down.

223
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:40,960
That's right.

224
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:43,120
Even if we're down, we'll knock them over.

225
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:43,840
Am I right?

226
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:45,200
Right, knock them over!

227
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:45,879
Knock them over, knock them!

228
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,240
And tear off some of their flesh.

229
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:48,919
Isn't that so?

230
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,440
Yes, it is.

231
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:51,720
Rip their flesh!

232
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:52,559
Brothers,

233
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:54,759
all these years

234
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:55,720
we've held back our anger.

235
00:13:57,679 --> 00:13:58,919
Wanting to fight the Japs,

236
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:01,039
even more wanting to wipe them out.

237
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,480
Only when we drive out the Japs

238
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:06,799
can we stand tall.

239
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,480
Right?

240
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,240
Yes, right.

241
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,840
This bowl of wine

242
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:13,639
we brothers

243
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,159
toast to the old platoon leader.

244
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,039
To the old platoon leader! To the old platoon leader!

245
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:19,440
Thank you, brothers.

246
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:20,200
Cheers!

247
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,679
Cheers! Drink up!

248
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:26,679
Today's wine

249
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:28,080
is so satisfying.

250
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:28,799
Here,

251
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,919
Drink more water to sober up.

252
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,759
Are you feeling well?

253
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,240
Pretty good.

254
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:40,960
You,

255
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:42,879
just focus

256
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:44,120
on having the baby first.

257
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,720
I'm not in a hurry to go down the mountain.

258
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:51,559
When we find the main force,

259
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,639
we'll come for you then.

260
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,440
How many people do you have here?

261
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,279
About thirty people.

262
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,159
Xiao Gui has twenty people.

263
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,600
That's quite a few when you add them up.

264
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:11,559
But...

265
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,519
They don't have much experience.

266
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,320
Once they're on the battlefield,

267
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,000
they'll definitely suffer.

268
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,200
It'd be great if we could recruit some skilled people.

269
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:25,200
My wife is right about this.

270
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,039
Are you pretending to sleep?

271
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:31,360
Why would I pretend to sleep?

272
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,639
Oh my goodness.

273
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,960
You were just tipsy a moment ago.

274
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:36,879
Listening to you two talk about fighting,

275
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,200
I just can't hold back my words.

276
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:40,840
Uncle,

277
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:45,320
I think Hua'er is right.

278
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:47,000
Even if we find more people,

279
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,759
if they're all useless, what's the point?

280
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,120
We need to find capable ones.

281
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,000
But those capable ones,

282
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,879
where do we look for them?

283
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,080
I actually know a few.

284
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:00,440
But...

285
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,000
whether we can get them,

286
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,039
we don't know.

287
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,159
Go ahead, tell us.

288
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:08,360
At the east end of Congshan,

289
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,159
isn't there a place called Yema Beach?

290
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,080
There's an old donkey living there.

291
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,679
He raises horses for a living.

292
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:14,879
He has three sons.

293
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,600
Big Donkey, Second Donkey, Little Donkey.

294
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:18,919
These three guys,

295
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,320
they're not ordinary people.

296
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,399
On horseback or off, they're skilled with blades and guns.

297
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:23,960
Their reputation echoes for miles around.

298
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:25,720
Third Brother, hurry up.

299
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:26,440
That guy,

300
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,799
if he shouts at Yema Beach,

301
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,600
everyone responds to his call.

302
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,320
Even the Japs know their worth.

303
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,799
They tried to recruit them before.

304
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:33,960
But they refused.

305
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:35,720
The Japs are ruthless.

306
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,240
They took away their horses.

307
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:38,200
And burned down their house.

308
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,840
So his family and the Japs

309
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,399
have a deep blood feud.

310
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:43,720
Hua'er,

311
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,360
this lead is pretty good.

312
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:49,200
If we can win them over,

313
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,559
maybe we can get a whole group.

314
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,159
See, that's what I'm saying.

315
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:54,720
That's exactly what I meant.

316
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:07,559
One, two, three, go!

317
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,079
Stop, stop!

318
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:13,079
Don't push!

319
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:15,559
What's that thing?

320
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,440
Big Brother, it's a person.

321
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:30,039
Is he alive?

322
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,559
Uncle, let me tell you,

323
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,559
before,

324
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,000
I tried to recruit him.

325
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,160
But he's picky.

326
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:44,880
He didn't think much of my little group.

327
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:46,319
Uncle,

328
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:49,279
whether we can get him,

329
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,359
depends on your skills.

330
00:17:59,240 --> 00:17:59,759
He's got spirit.

331
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:11,880
He's a tough guy.

332
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,000
He's awake.

333
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:18,279
Are you sick or injured?

334
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,359
What's wrong with you?

335
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:24,880
Give him something to eat.

336
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:26,759
Food.

337
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,640
Dad, I checked him.

338
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:45,680
He's just skin and bones.

339
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:46,880
No flesh at all.

340
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,440
Lots of people are skinny.

341
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,839
But he's still breathing.

342
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,799
We can't just let him die.

343
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:03,160
Yema Beach,

344
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,519
is a remote corner.

345
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,440
Hardly anyone comes here all year.

346
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,400
A few unfamiliar faces.

347
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:09,480
Why are you saving him?

348
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,599
Slow down.

349
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:20,960
Don't choke.

350
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,799
Where are you from?

351
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:28,960
Songzigou.

352
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,920
What are you doing at Yema Beach?

353
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,039
Just begging for food.

354
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,200
I wandered here while begging.

355
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,519
Like a headless fly, just wandering around.

356
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,000
Luckily, I ran into good people.

357
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:02,839
Old Brother,

358
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:04,440
You're really blessed.

359
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,640
How can you tell?

360
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,640
That I'm blessed?

361
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:11,599
You have three grown sons.

362
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,720
Each one is outstanding.

363
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,079
Look at that.

364
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,079
You don't even need to work the fields yourself.

365
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,039
That's real good fortune.

366
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
You look healthy and whole.

367
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:29,079
You don't seem like a beggar.

368
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,559
Me,

369
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:35,880
I had a serious illness.

370
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:37,599
Can't do heavy work anymore.

371
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,279
As for me,

372
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,680
Looking at you,

373
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:50,240
life isn't easy for you either.

374
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,200
It's not exactly comfortable.

375
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,440
With such a big family,

376
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,799
how come life turned out like this?

377
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,920
And how did you end up like this?

378
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,160
It's those foreign devils' fault.

379
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:06,359
Looks like your family

380
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,680
didn't escape this disaster either.

381
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:18,400
Those Japs,

382
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,880
really are harmful.

383
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:21,559
If they don't leave,

384
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:22,480
our lives

385
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:24,319
have no future.

386
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,400
Probably a rat

387
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:31,720
ran into the water jar.

388
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:35,400
Hit it pretty hard.

389
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:36,240
That's for sure.

390
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:37,680
Smashed its head open.

391
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:43,039
Old Brother,

392
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:46,559
Could I have another bowl?

393
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,160
You've suffered a lot.

394
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,200
That's right.

395
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,400
Good people get bullied.

396
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,880
Heard you have a wound.

397
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:15,960
Who doesn't have a wound?

398
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:17,680
A bullet wound.

399
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:22,720
Right here.

400
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:29,599
Here, and here.

401
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,200
Another one here.

402
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,720
A big scar.

403
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,039
The Japs did that too.

404
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:38,240
We were living peacefully,

405
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:39,480
everything was fine.

406
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:41,240
Didn't bother anyone.

407
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,759
Why did they do this?

408
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:54,039
Strangers came into our home.

409
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:57,160
Even wanted to take off their shoes and sit on our bed.

410
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,440
Trying to act like they own the place.

411
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,440
If we don't agree,

412
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,920
they beat and curse us.

413
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:06,599
If they get angry,

414
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,720
they might even kill us.

415
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,519
Don't you think so?

416
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,839
No one could put up with that.

417
00:23:20,519 --> 00:23:21,359
We

418
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,440
have to drive out these foreign devils.

419
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:26,000
And make them pay for their crimes.

420
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:28,680
Right?

421
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,799
Eat and then leave.

422
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,279
It's late at night.

423
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:38,359
Where else could I go?

424
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:39,559
If you're going to be kind, go all the way.

425
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:41,119
Let me stay here

426
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:41,920
and rest for a couple of days.

427
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:47,359
Alright then.

428
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:49,160
You can stay here.

429
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,000
Get a good night's sleep.

430
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:52,519
Tomorrow morning,

431
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:53,839
I'll make you a big meat meal.

432
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:55,839
There's more meat?

433
00:24:56,759 --> 00:24:58,079
Not just meat, there's also wine.

434
00:24:59,160 --> 00:24:59,640
Tell me,

435
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,920
did I run into a good person or what?

436
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,079
Meat and wine, all here.

437
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,200
Just depends if your belly

438
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,240
can handle it all.

439
00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:06,559
As long as you're willing,

440
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,880
I'll eat as much as I can.

441
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,599
Eat to your heart's content.

442
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,640
Dinner's ready.

443
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,440
Why don't I smell any meat?

444
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,119
Waiting for you to go in the pot.

445
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:38,799
Alright.

446
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:40,759
Hold on.

447
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:52,960
Speak.

448
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,519
Say what?

449
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,920
Which bandit gang are you from?

450
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,440
Are you a mountain bandit or a roaming one?

451
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:06,039
Are you a "nail" or a "thorn"?

452
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:09,480
I don't understand.

453
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:12,000
Wait till I slice some meat off you,

454
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:12,839
stew it in a pot,

455
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:13,920
then you'll understand.

456
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:20,079
I'm really not a bandit.

457
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,640
Let's cut a piece first.

458
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:23,480
See if it tastes like bandit.

459
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:25,839
Where should I cut?

460
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:27,680
Start with his cheek.

461
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,720
Don't be ridiculous.

462
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,079
There's no meat left on his face.

463
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:30,799
His butt.

464
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,079
That's fatty.

465
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,359
Butt meat's too tough, not tasty.

466
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,960
His tongue looks good, all fresh meat.

467
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:37,799
Not the tongue.

468
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:39,279
If you cut the tongue, he can't talk.

469
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:40,319
Heart meat.

470
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,400
Nice and chewy.

471
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,319
Heart meat is good.

472
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,519
That stuff smells great.

473
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,960
Wait, wait, wait!

474
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,319
Let me finish talking, alright?

475
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,200
If you've got something to say, spit it out.

476
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,640
You really think I'm a bandit?

477
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,359
Then why would a bandit come to your house?

478
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:58,920
What's there to gain?

479
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,880
Weeds on the roof are waist-high.

480
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:03,759
Even the wind can't find its way through this poor place.

481
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:05,519
You have to hold the wall just to fart.

482
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,039
Even the rats curse when they come in.

483
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:08,559
If I were a bandit,

484
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,680
what good would I get from your house?

485
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:14,359
Didn't we already talk about this?

486
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:16,559
You're definitely not a beggar.

487
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:18,160
You're hiding something.

488
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:19,839
Tell the truth.

489
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,359
What are you really here for?

490
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,559
I know all about your family.

491
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:32,519
I know everything.

492
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,599
Your house,

493
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:36,720
you'd rather let the Japs tear it down

494
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,079
than be their dog.

495
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,640
Just for that,

496
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:42,799
you're real men.

497
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:43,599
Enough.

498
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,880
Stop dragging it out.

499
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,200
You're covered in scars.

500
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,559
And bullet wounds.

501
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,039
You've seen blood.

502
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:50,839
I have.

503
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,160
Human blood.

504
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,400
The blood of our people.

505
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,519
The blood of Anti-Japanese Allied Forces fighters.

506
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
And Japs,

507
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,240
and traitors' blood.

508
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,599
Whose blood is on your hands?

509
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,119
Japs.

510
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:14,160
Traitors.

511
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,160
Since we've come this far,

512
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,680
no more secrets.

513
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,720
I'm with the Anti-Japanese Allied Forces.

514
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,759
Our unit

515
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,039
was scattered by the Japs.

516
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,279
Now I'm

517
00:28:34,359 --> 00:28:35,839
looking for capable people everywhere.

518
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:38,480
To rebuild the team and fight them again.

519
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,839
I came here

520
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:41,880
to ask you to join us.

521
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:43,279
Fight the Japs together.

522
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,559
Why didn't you just say so?

523
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:53,119
Why all the roundabout talk?

524
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:54,599
Why are you wasting time?

525
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:55,960
Does it help?

526
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,599
It's our first meeting.

527
00:28:58,079 --> 00:28:59,799
I had to size you up first.

528
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:01,119
With that look in your eyes,

529
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,200
you think you can fight the Japs?

530
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:03,640
We could hand you over

531
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,720
to the Japs right now.

532
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,839
With your build,

533
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,400
they'd give us at least a hundred silver dollars.

534
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:10,200
Don't blame me.

535
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,640
I'm broke and starving.

536
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:13,559
When I see meat,

537
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:15,000
how can I not grab a bite?

538
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:16,720
Let's go.

539
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,559
The longer we wait, the more trouble.

540
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,240
Move.

541
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:20,880
Go.

542
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:24,759
Wait.

543
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:31,200
You can still change your mind.

544
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,440
That's embarrassing.

545
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,119
I'll be honest with you.

546
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,279
We've been working with the Japs

547
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:47,079
for a long time.

548
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:49,400
We've already handed over

549
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,599
three Anti-Japanese Allied Forces members.

550
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,680
Got three big gold bars.

551
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,319
If we turn you in,

552
00:29:55,799 --> 00:29:57,160
we'll get

553
00:29:58,279 --> 00:29:59,319
eighty or a hundred acres of land.

554
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,000
Build three new houses.

555
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:02,400
For my three sons.

556
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:03,799
And marry three wives.

557
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,759
Pretty funny, huh?

558
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,079
I'm really lucky.

559
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,359
For no reason at all,

560
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,960
I got three filial sons and grandsons.

561
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:20,000
Just a reminder,

562
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,759
visit my grave every year on my death anniversary.

563
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:25,480
Pay your respects.

564
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:28,440
Go to my grave on New Year's Eve.

565
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,400
Light a lamp for me.

566
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:33,480
Invite me home and honor me.

567
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,039
Set out four dishes and eight bowls.

568
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,839
Offer wine so I can drink

569
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,880
with gusto.

570
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,359
Dumplings, beef, and eggs on New Year's Day.

571
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,599
One bite, full of flavor.

572
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,119
Must be so tasty my mouth stays fragrant.

573
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,359
If I'm happy with the food,

574
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,200
I'll let out a couple of farts.

575
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,440
On your roof beam.

576
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,559
Floating around.

577
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,839
Until the locust blossoms in May.

578
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,039
On the second day of the New Year,

579
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,920
no need to send me off.

580
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,160
Know why?

581
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:03,480
The night before,

582
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:05,319
I'll come down from the altar.

583
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:07,440
And strangle each of you myself.

584
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,559
You four donkeys.

585
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,839
You sure talk fast.

586
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,279
Go tell the Japs.

587
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:14,960
Let's go.

588
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:17,000
Go.

589
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:24,400
Come.

590
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,119
Sir

591
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:55,039
I want to report something.

592
00:31:59,079 --> 00:31:59,799
Report what?

593
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,039
This gun.

594
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:13,599
Where did it come from?

595
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:15,079
It's his.

596
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:16,839
He's with the Anti-Japanese Allied Forces.

597
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,720
Didn't you say before, sir?

598
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,640
If you catch an Anti-Japanese fighter,

599
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,640
you get a big gold bar as a reward.

600
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,960
This time, I don't want gold.

601
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:28,960
Can you give me dozens of acres of land instead?

602
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,240
My three sons are all grown up.

603
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,839
They want to marry, but have no home.

604
00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:40,440
Land can be arranged.

605
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,079
Yes.

606
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,839
But...

607
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:44,799
Besides this gun,

608
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,960
what other proof do you have

609
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,559
that he's with the Anti-Japanese Allied Forces?

610
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:02,079
He's covered in gunshot wounds.

611
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:04,160
All scars.

612
00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:06,640
See for yourself if you don't believe me.

613
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:20,920
What are you doing?

614
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:25,440
Go to hell!

615
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:27,680
You bastard!

616
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,799
What are you trying to do?

617
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:53,799
Brother,

618
00:33:54,839 --> 00:33:55,599
don't blame me.

619
00:33:56,319 --> 00:33:57,480
In times like these, you can't trust anyone.

620
00:33:58,319 --> 00:33:59,680
I did all this just to see

621
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,759
if you'd dare kill a Jap.

622
00:34:02,359 --> 00:34:02,920
Hurry up.

623
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,319
Pack up.

624
00:34:04,359 --> 00:34:05,480
Take everything you can.

625
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:17,159
Let's go.

626
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,119
Uncle,

627
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:25,599
No, no.

628
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:26,679
Come on, give it to me.

629
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,320
What are you doing?

630
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:31,079
Let me pour the wine.

631
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:33,400
This isn't for calming nerves.

632
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,760
With your guts,

633
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:37,760
what's there to be scared of?

634
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,119
Brother, to be honest,

635
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:42,599
everyone fears death.

636
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:44,119
But the worst fear is

637
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,199
dying for nothing.

638
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,119
At first, I really thought

639
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:52,599
I'd misjudged you.

640
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:55,360
Sorry, heroes.

641
00:34:55,559 --> 00:34:56,280
A toast to you all.

642
00:34:57,039 --> 00:34:58,880
We also fear misjudging people.

643
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,360
Brother,

644
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,760
I want to ask,

645
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,039
how did you get that gun?

646
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:13,280
And also,

647
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,119
what's that little wooden tag?

648
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,480
You'd have to ask my sons.

649
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,800
They did all that.

650
00:35:21,239 --> 00:35:22,920
Tell your uncle what happened.

651
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:25,960
Uncle, at Wild Horse Beach,

652
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:28,000
there's a bandit den in the southeast corner.

653
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:29,119
It's called Black Wolf Fort.

654
00:35:29,639 --> 00:35:31,559
Those guys are real scum.

655
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,199
They hide from the Japanese,

656
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:35,639
but cause trouble for Chinese.

657
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:36,639
One time, they came again.

658
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:38,320
We ran into one who was alone.

659
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:39,679
The three of us took him out.

660
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:41,079
Uncle,

661
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,480
that gun you just saw

662
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,920
and that bandit badge

663
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:45,199
were taken from him.

664
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:49,679
Brother,

665
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,000
so you planned to kill those Japs all along?

666
00:35:52,039 --> 00:35:53,280
You'd thought it through beforehand.

667
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:55,039
Impressive.

668
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,559
Really impressive.

669
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,159
Come on.

670
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,679
In these lands of white mountains and black waters,

671
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,280
there are heroes,

672
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:12,880
and traitors too.

673
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:17,519
Traitors target Anti-Japanese fighters.

674
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,280
Sometimes,

675
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,159
these traitors

676
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,840
even pretend to be Anti-Japanese to trick us.

677
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,639
They try to get information from us.

678
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:26,760
If anyone praises the Anti-Japanese,

679
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,960
gets close to them,

680
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:29,719
or speaks ill of the Japs,

681
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,679
they immediately turn around

682
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,320
and tell the Japanese.

683
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:36,880
Then they come back to arrest people for reward money.

684
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:40,800
These traitors

685
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,000
are more hateful than anything.

686
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,880
Speaking of you Anti-Japanese Allied Forces,

687
00:36:52,519 --> 00:36:53,400
I've really met one.

688
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,239
One winter,

689
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,599
I went up the mountain to chop wood.

690
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,599
I passed by an underground shelter.

691
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,039
I vaguely

692
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,280
saw someone inside.

693
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,440
When I got closer,

694
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,440
there really was someone lying there.

695
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:15,840
His chin,

696
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,440
had been shot through.

697
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:21,000
He used a rope himself

698
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,920
to tie up his chin.

699
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:26,159
His chin was all mangled.

700
00:37:27,719 --> 00:37:28,760
He couldn't speak.

701
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,280
He just gestured to me.

702
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,519
Gestured again and again.

703
00:37:31,639 --> 00:37:32,719
Kept gesturing.

704
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,280
I finally understood.

705
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,400
Turns out he was with the Anti-Japanese Allied Forces.

706
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:39,559
So I saved him.

707
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,480
I went back home.

708
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,719
Cooked two potatoes for him.

709
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,840
I brought them to him.

710
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,320
But he couldn't eat.

711
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,719
So I mashed the potatoes.

712
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:56,400
And stuffed them into his mouth.

713
00:37:57,639 --> 00:37:58,440
Bit by bit,

714
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,840
I pushed them down his throat.

715
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:01,639
Made him swallow them raw.

716
00:38:02,599 --> 00:38:03,679
I said to him,

717
00:38:03,719 --> 00:38:05,079
Look what you've done to yourself.

718
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,480
If your parents saw this,

719
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,599
how heartbroken they'd be.

720
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,000
He still couldn't speak.

721
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,679
He wrote on a piece of paper.

722
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,519
Wrote a line.

723
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,119
He said for six years

724
00:38:32,119 --> 00:38:33,480
he hadn't seen his father.

725
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:35,840
He wanted to call me "Dad."

726
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:40,480
I said, "Son,"

727
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:45,119
"let me call you my boy."

728
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:48,039
He turned his face away.

729
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,519
I didn't see him cry.

730
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:52,679
Just saw his shoulders shaking.

731
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,199
Like two wings trembling.

732
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,360
Later, I brought him medicine.

733
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,679
But he was gone.

734
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:13,559
I heard people say

735
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:15,440
the Japanese found him.

736
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:17,679
Burned him alive.

737
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:20,719
Later, I heard again

738
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,559
he was

739
00:39:26,719 --> 00:39:29,039
the famous Anti-Japanese Allied Forces hero,

740
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,440
Commander Wei.

741
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:42,400
I know him, I really do.

742
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,840
He's an old Party member sent from the Central Plains.

743
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:54,840
He once said,

744
00:39:58,159 --> 00:40:00,519
as long as people like us are still here,

745
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,400
still alive,

746
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,559
it's like

747
00:40:08,199 --> 00:40:09,280
a spark,

748
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,639
even just a tiny one,

749
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,360
in these white mountains and black waters,

750
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,280
it can suddenly

751
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:19,239
burst into a blazing fire.

752
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:19,880
Do you believe it?

753
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:22,840
I do.

754
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,440
I've always believed.

755
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:27,679
With you iron-willed men around,

756
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,320
we'll surely win this war.

757
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,320
Our country won't fall.

758
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,280
Brother, for what you just said,

759
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:39,599
let me toast you again.

760
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:45,159
Pour the wine.

761
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:46,840
Come on.

762
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,719
There's one more thing.

763
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:55,599
Old Brother,

764
00:40:56,599 --> 00:40:58,199
Before I came here, I already knew

765
00:40:58,239 --> 00:41:00,360
your family are heroes in this area.

766
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:01,960
You have influence.

767
00:41:02,719 --> 00:41:03,639
Everyone answers your call.

768
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,440
Brother,

769
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,519
Could you ask everyone for me?

770
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:13,719
I have money now.

771
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:16,079
Anyone who wants to join me in the mountains

772
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:16,960
to fight the Japs,

773
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,119
every family can get a share.

774
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,639
Can you fight the Japs just for money?

775
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,320
Will money keep your heart true?

776
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,000
Will you still risk your life?

777
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:27,440
No, I...

778
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:28,559
I'm not afraid of everyone.

779
00:41:28,599 --> 00:41:29,639
But people have doubts.

780
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
You give them money,

781
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,559
it only covers a few meals.

782
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,920
If you're meant to go hungry, you'll still go hungry.

783
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,559
If you want a comfortable life,

784
00:41:41,639 --> 00:41:42,800
a peaceful life,

785
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,239
everyone has to unite.

786
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,960
First, drive out the Japs.

787
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,079
Then you can live in peace.

788
00:41:49,159 --> 00:41:49,679
Right?

789
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:51,719
Brother,

790
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,199
you're truly wise.

791
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:55,320
Wisdom alone isn't enough.

792
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,079
I'm old now.

793
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,840
My legs are weak, my heart willing but my body can't.

794
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:02,039
I can't lend a hand.

795
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,639
This is for the young to do.

796
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:09,159
You three,

797
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,440
say something to your uncle.

798
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:16,119
I've held this anger in for a long time.

799
00:42:16,199 --> 00:42:17,199
I'm about to explode.

800
00:42:17,639 --> 00:42:18,840
Now I have a way to let it out.

801
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,559
I need to vent it hard.

802
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:22,559
A real man stands tall.

803
00:42:23,079 --> 00:42:23,599
His back.

804
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,480
Only bows to parents

805
00:42:24,519 --> 00:42:25,599
and ancestors.

806
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,880
A fence needs three stakes.

807
00:42:29,159 --> 00:42:30,679
Brothers must not be divided.

808
00:42:32,679 --> 00:42:33,119
Come on.

809
00:42:34,159 --> 00:42:34,840
Father toasts you.

810
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,079
You're all good men.

811
00:42:39,239 --> 00:42:40,639
It's easy to be a dog, hard to be a man.

812
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,480
We're all Chinese.

813
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:43,480
We must live with

814
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:44,800
the backbone of the Chinese.

815
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:45,679
Understand?

816
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:46,719
We understand, Father.

817
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:47,320
Let's do it!
