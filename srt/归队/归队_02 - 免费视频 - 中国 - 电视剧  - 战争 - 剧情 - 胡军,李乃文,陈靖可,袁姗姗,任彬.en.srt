1
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:41,879
Uncle

2
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,400
We've been walking for three days.

3
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:47,439
We'll starve before we even get there.

4
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,879
Don't talk like that.

5
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,000
Look at this whole forest.

6
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:53,359
There's bark and roots everywhere.

7
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,079
We won't starve.

8
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:57,920
Eating that won't give us any strength.

9
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,079
What if we run into a big animal?

10
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:02,719
Either it eats us,

11
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:04,079
or we eat it.

12
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,959
Uncle, you're really fearless.

13
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,080
I need to rest for a bit.

14
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:11,719
Alright.

15
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,280
It's fine to take a break.

16
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,159
Let's rest.

17
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,039
Old Mountain God

18
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:25,759
This mountain is split in two.

19
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:27,280
Everyone digs for their own food.

20
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,800
Everyone fattens up on their own.

21
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,159
But this ginseng

22
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:32,479
grew right on the border.

23
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,800
We found it first.

24
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,840
The ginseng lock is already tied.

25
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,759
It should belong to us.

26
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:39,360
Exactly.

27
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,520
Who says that's the border?

28
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,800
I say this is our territory.

29
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:45,560
That's right.

30
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:47,280
No, Lin the Tall.

31
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,719
If you talk like that,

32
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:53,039
you're being unreasonable.

33
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:54,599
What are you gonna do about it?

34
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:56,919
You want to fight?

35
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:58,400
You think I'm scared of you?

36
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,360
It's just a few of us.

37
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:02,639
Don't act tough just because you have more people.

38
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:04,000
Don't throw your weight around.

39
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,240
Let me tell you,

40
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,800
The Mountain Deity won't stand for this.

41
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,080
Stop wasting time, guys.

42
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:11,159
Lift the ginseng.

43
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,120
I dare anyone to try.

44
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:13,560
Watch me.

45
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,520
Lin the Tall

46
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,800
Lin the Tall, you're going too far!

47
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,599
Stop, stop, don't fight!

48
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,120
Alright.

49
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:50,000
That was too much.

50
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:50,919
You asked for it.

51
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:51,439
Stop, stop.

52
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,879
I'll kill you.

53
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:02,280
Listen to me.

54
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,400
What is it?

55
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:11,639
Everyone, stop!

56
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,199
Our people

57
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,399
Let go too.

58
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,040
This ginseng

59
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:26,720
I'll decide today.

60
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:28,519
You can have it.

61
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:29,560
Foreman

62
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,199
Why give it to him?

63
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,079
Foreman

64
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:32,120
Shut up.

65
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,160
Why should we let him have it?

66
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:42,399
Did you hear that?

67
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,639
You can't just take it for free.

68
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,759
So, what do you want?

69
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:49,000
First,

70
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,560
Leave all your money here.

71
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,279
Second,

72
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:56,279
your food supplies,

73
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,319
leave those too.

74
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,000
Most importantly,

75
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:04,879
for the next three years,

76
00:05:05,959 --> 00:05:06,959
this territory

77
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:08,759
belongs to Old Mountain God.

78
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,439
You can't come back here.

79
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,720
Deal?

80
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:15,040
That's not fair, that's not right.

81
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,560
Enough, enough.

82
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:18,959
Definitely not.

83
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:19,879
Fine.

84
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:21,839
Put it down, put it down.

85
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,079
Money and food,

86
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:24,000
you can have them.

87
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,160
This place,

88
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:27,319
I don't care to come back anyway.

89
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:31,240
Foreman,

90
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:33,199
Are we just letting them off this easy?

91
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,000
Just this little money and food,

92
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,879
what good is it?

93
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:38,879
We're here to make money.

94
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:40,959
Is it worth risking our lives?

95
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,120
Brother,

96
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:48,120
We just met by chance, thank you.

97
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:48,839
Don't mention it.

98
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,680
And you, young man,

99
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:54,800
you're young but skilled.

100
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,079
When you see injustice,

101
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,120
you step in to help.

102
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:58,079
It's the right thing to do.

103
00:05:58,519 --> 00:05:59,519
Well said.

104
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,600
What's going on?

105
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,240
Gui'er,

106
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:05,600
I'm starving.

107
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:06,560
Really starving.

108
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:08,199
Can you spare some food?

109
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,319
We got lost in these mountains.

110
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:11,959
Haven't eaten in days.

111
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,439
Time to start work.

112
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:21,360
The blazing sun shines down on us.

113
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,560
Everyone, get up!

114
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:25,240
The women in our dreams have grown old.

115
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,000
Is he still okay or not?

116
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:28,279
He’s fine. Get up and get to work.

117
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,639
No, he’s not.

118
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,560
Are you blind?

119
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,839
Can’t you see what he looks like?

120
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,920
He’s done for, isn’t he?

121
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,560
If he’s useless, drag him out for the dogs.

122
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:38,079
Just try to move.

123
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,279
Foreman.

124
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:43,839
My brother is sick.

125
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:45,480
Can you get him a doctor?

126
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,560
Sick, huh?

127
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:49,920
Can he still eat?

128
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,480
What do you mean?

129
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:56,439
If he can eat, he can work.

130
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:57,920
Gold pit.

131
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,000
No freeloaders here.

132
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:01,360
Please do me a favor.

133
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,560
I’m begging you.

134
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,680
I’ll take him.

135
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,519
Is that okay?

136
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:07,560
Trying to run, huh?

137
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:10,000
You really have no idea.

138
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,959
You think I don’t know who you are?

139
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:12,720
Get him.

140
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:15,000
Go all out.

141
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:15,920
Alright.

142
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,079
So you want to escape?

143
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:22,319
Brother.

144
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,600
Uncle.

145
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,079
Brother.

146
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,680
Let’s talk this out.

147
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,959
What do you want?

148
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:31,279
I told you, my brother is sick.

149
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:32,439
He needs a doctor.

150
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,079
Around here,

151
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,600
no one’s ever heard

152
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,879
of anyone being a doctor.

153
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:37,680
If there is one,

154
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:38,959
he’s far away.

155
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:40,959
Coming here would cost a fortune.

156
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:41,720
No matter the price,

157
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,680
I’ll pay for it.

158
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:43,279
Otherwise,

159
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:44,720
think again.

160
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,399
If someone dies here,

161
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:49,120
and has family,

162
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,040
we’ll give them some money.

163
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,600
And a plain white coffin.

164
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,279
Forget it.

165
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:53,720
Brother.

166
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,920
Let’s test it on your nephew today.

167
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,360
Let’s see if there’s really a doctor.

168
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:57,040
There is.

169
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,560
Uncle.

170
00:07:57,639 --> 00:07:58,319
Yes, yes, yes.

171
00:07:59,319 --> 00:07:59,800
Er, go!

172
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:01,639
Go find a doctor, quick.

173
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,199
Alright.

174
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:03,079
Right away, bring him here.

175
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,399
Run yourself, hurry up!

176
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,319
Our team

177
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,800
is getting smaller with every fight.

178
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,800
The Japanese sweep squads

179
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,920
haven’t let up for months.

180
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,240
Our people

181
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:18,720
are wounded or scattered.

182
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,680
Those who return to us now

183
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,439
and keep fighting the Japanese

184
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:24,879
are the backbone of the Resistance.

185
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:25,959
Our lifeblood.

186
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:28,639
As long as we have our lifeblood,

187
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,759
the flame of resistance

188
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,120
will never die.

189
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:34,360
Brothers,

190
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:35,720
Brothers,

191
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,519
no matter how hard it gets, we keep searching.

192
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:40,000
We gather our sparks

193
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:41,759
bit by bit,

194
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,080
and bring them all back.

195
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:43,879
Understand?

196
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,000
Got it, Squad Leader Zhao.

197
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:45,639
Good.

198
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:46,080
Let’s go.

199
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:04,399
Brother,

200
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,240
We meet again.

201
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:07,519
Yeah.

202
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,480
Nice shooting.

203
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,039
Let me ask you something, brother.

204
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,399
Have you seen anyone in the woods lately?

205
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:16,519
Run into anyone?

206
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:20,159
Yeah.

207
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,000
A few.

208
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,000
Just one.

209
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,360
He's a tough guy.

210
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:25,320
He killed a wolf by himself.

211
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,960
But he's pretty decent.

212
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:28,279
How can you tell?

213
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:31,200
He was starving but still shared his food with me.

214
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:32,519
Where did he go?

215
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:34,639
Songlin Town.

216
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:38,039
Songlin Town?

217
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,240
How far is that from here?

218
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,519
Through the woods, it takes at least ten days.

219
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:47,600
With your leg...

220
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,559
It's risky.

221
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:51,159
In a couple of days,

222
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,679
I'm heading to Songlin Town.

223
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,480
To sell pelts.

224
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:55,440
We can go together.

225
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:56,799
As for you,

226
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:58,399
Take care and heal up.

227
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,159
I can't wait.

228
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,000
I've got urgent business.

229
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:04,519
Did he say

230
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:05,600
why he's going to Songlin Town?

231
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:07,559
No, he didn't.

232
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,639
Brother,

233
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,519
Can I ask you a favor?

234
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,240
If you see a stranger again,

235
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:14,600
keep him here.

236
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,399
Don't let him leave.

237
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,879
Just say someone's looking for him.

238
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:18,840
Got it.

239
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:20,039
Thanks, brother.

240
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:22,960
Comrade

241
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:49,360
How are you?

242
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:55,679
Which unit are you from?

243
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,399
The Fourth Army

244
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:01,840
From the Fourth Army

245
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,879
Slipped.

246
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:45,320
Just right.

247
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,159
Let's take a break.

248
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,559
Comrade.

249
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:53,840
Listen to me.

250
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,799
If we keep this up,

251
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,360
we'll both die in these mountains.

252
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,960
Just make it quick for me.

253
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,279
You go.

254
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:12,120
No way.

255
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:14,279
If we go, we go together.

256
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,600
Why?

257
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:20,080
You want me to fight the Japanese alone?

258
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:22,639
I have to take you with me.

259
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:35,639
Comrade.

260
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,240
What's your name?

261
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:40,960
My name is

262
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,480
Li Ermao.

263
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:47,080
I'm Tang Deyuan.

264
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:56,200
Comrade Li Ermao,

265
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,279
if in two days

266
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,000
we still can't get out,

267
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,240
I'll do as you say.

268
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,679
Deal?

269
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,039
Alright.

270
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:16,279
Okay.

271
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:29,960
What are you looking at?

272
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,799
Thinking again, huh?

273
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,240
Hey, brother,

274
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:41,399
could you draw us a map?

275
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,440
Let us

276
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:44,159
try to find a way out.

277
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,399
Why won't you listen to me?

278
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,799
Did you forget how you

279
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:49,840
ended up meeting me?

280
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,279
Without me leading you,

281
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:52,919
even if you get out of this valley,

282
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,039
you'll just fall into another trap.

283
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:58,000
The fighting is fierce right now.

284
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,559
The Japanese are all down the mountain.

285
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:02,679
All the paths down are blocked.

286
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:08,200
I won't stop you from fighting the Japanese.

287
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,600
I support you.

288
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,039
But shouldn't you

289
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:14,039
make sure you survive first?

290
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:18,480
Come with me.

291
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,480
A little more time won't hurt.

292
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:27,639
Xiao Gui.

293
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:32,879
What's wrong?

294
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:37,480
Didn't you see the snake?

295
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:39,799
Stop looking.

296
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,720
It's gone.

297
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,639
In the mountains,

298
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,480
you need eyes in the back of your head.

299
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,600
Ginseng.

300
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:07,440
Ginseng.

301
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,440
Smooth going, smooth going!

302
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,159
Ginseng.

303
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,480
Ginseng.

304
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,080
Ginseng.

305
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,200
Hurry!

306
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:18,919
Set up the pole.

307
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:19,440
Come on, come on!

308
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,559
Here, hold this for me.

309
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,279
Did you see clearly?

310
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:41,639
What grade are the leaves?

311
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,639
Guys,

312
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:45,799
Grade seven.

313
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,840
Grade seven! Grade seven! Grade seven!

314
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,799
This is a real treasure.

315
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:50,120
We're rich!

316
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:51,039
We're rich! We're rich!

317
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:52,720
Over a hundred years old.

318
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,360
Grade seven.

319
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,279
King Ginseng.

320
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,679
How much is this worth?

321
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:57,159
Then we can make a fortune!

322
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,200
We'll definitely get a sky-high price!

323
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:35,839
Scissors

324
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,440
This

325
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:30,720
This one's huge.

326
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:31,759
How about it?

327
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:32,720
The shape is perfect too.

328
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,960
We're going to strike it rich this time.

329
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:34,839
We'll have money now.

330
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,799
Come on, bring the bark.

331
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:37,599
Hurry up, come here.

332
00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:40,359
Give me another piece.

333
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:43,480
What a treasure.

334
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:48,799
Come on, moss.

335
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:49,599
Moss.

336
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:12,759
Seeds.

337
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,079
Yunhu.

338
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:40,279
What do you think?

339
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,079
We've all been here

340
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:42,160
working for so long.

341
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:44,160
But we haven't seen much gold.

342
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:45,759
Yeah.

343
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:47,400
It doesn't seem right to me either.

344
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:49,160
And there are so many people here.

345
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:51,680
You pinned down the gold foreman.

346
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,759
And his nephew too.

347
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:55,119
Why doesn't he say a word?

348
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:56,680
How would I know?

349
00:19:57,359 --> 00:19:58,319
You should ask him.

350
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,839
What's the point in asking?

351
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,720
When he saw you risking your life,

352
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,119
he didn't dare touch you.

353
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,960
That gold foreman,

354
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:07,559
he looks tough,

355
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:09,680
but he's just like those traitors.

356
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:11,680
Deep down, he's rotten too.

357
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:13,480
Let me tell you,

358
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,680
it's just the two of us running for our lives now.

359
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:16,519
I reckon

360
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,960
he can't do anything to us.

361
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,160
Squad leader.

362
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:24,799
They've probably reached Songlin Town by now.

363
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,519
Yeah.

364
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:29,400
Maybe we're the only ones left.

365
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:31,680
I bet the squad leader now

366
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:32,440
is here.

367
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,160
Who's here?

368
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,079
I need to take a dump.

369
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,279
You keep working.

370
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:40,160
I'll be quick.

371
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:42,000
Lazy donkeys always need a break.

372
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,680
Hurry up.

373
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:57,000
There's no rice left to cook today.

374
00:20:57,359 --> 00:20:59,480
What I'm afraid of is

375
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:04,759
a family of four, young and old,

376
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:07,480
might not survive till tomorrow.

377
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:09,599
I'm holding the door plank.

378
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:10,599
Why is it this noise again?

379
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,839
I'm waiting for my husband.

380
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,079
Collapse!

381
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,039
Collapse!

382
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:53,119
Someone help!

383
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,000
Collapse!

384
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:57,480
Collapse!

385
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,759
Someone help!

386
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,759
Getting a doctor won't help this time.

387
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:05,400
Yunhu

388
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,720
Yunhu

389
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:08,960
Why did you leave him outside?

390
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,000
You guys,

391
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,119
Hold him down for me.

392
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,799
Grab him!

393
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,319
Go after him!

394
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:12,839
Chase him!

395
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,240
Stop!

396
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,759
Hurry, over here!

397
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,200
Quick!

398
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:33,680
Hurry!

399
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:36,279
Don't dawdle!

400
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,079
Let's go, move forward!

401
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,279
Comrade Tang Deyuan

402
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,960
It's dawn.

403
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,759
Two days have passed.

404
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:45,759
It's morning.

405
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:47,519
Come here.

406
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:50,319
It's daylight.

407
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,200
Drink some water first.

408
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,720
I don't want any.

409
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,640
Why not?

410
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,839
I know you can't do it.

411
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:03,359
Put the knife down.

412
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,000
Go pee in the woods.

413
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:16,640
I'm begging you.

414
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:19,640
You're helping me.

415
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:23,519
I'm really struggling.

416
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,960
In the next life,

417
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,720
let's be comrades again.

418
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,279
Comrade,

419
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,400
what's your name?

420
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,319
My name is

421
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,480
Li Ermao.

422
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,519
Comrade,

423
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:27,559
don't worry about me.

424
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,160
I can't make it.

425
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,799
If you can eat, you can survive, you know?

426
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,000
Didn't you say

427
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,079
you're from Huachuan?

428
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,440
Oh my,

429
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:40,559
Huachuan pork head,

430
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:42,160
it's so delicious.

431
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:43,519
Comrade,

432
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,680
just make it quick for me.

433
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,079
You go.

434
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:48,559
No way.

435
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:50,759
If we go, we go together.

436
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,000
Why should I?

437
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,480
Fight the Japanese alone?

438
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,039
I have to take you with me.

439
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:00,920
Comrade Li Ermao.

440
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,039
Comrade Li Ermao.

441
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:06,920
Comrade Li Ermao.

442
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:07,799
Li...

443
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,400
Hurry up.

444
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,319
Get off quickly.

445
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:34,759
Get off.

446
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,279
Come here.

447
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:37,519
You, come here.

448
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,400
Go over there.

449
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,079
Move it.

450
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:40,839
Go.

451
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,480
Hurry.

452
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:43,720
Hurry up.

453
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,079
Stop dawdling.

454
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:48,839
Hurry up.

455
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:50,279
You too.

456
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:52,519
Hurry up.

457
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:56,880
Hurry.

458
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,440
You too, keep up.

459
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,200
Stop dragging your feet, move!

460
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:27,119
Hurry up, what are you doing?

461
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,160
Hurry up.

462
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:35,960
Stand up.

463
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,480
Go to hell.

464
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,480
Good.

465
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,039
All strong workers.

466
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:26,759
Yes.

467
00:30:34,359 --> 00:30:34,799
What's your name?

468
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:35,680
I-I'm Zhao Fugui.

469
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,039
Where are you from?

470
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,400
Bai Gangzi.

471
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:39,680
How old are you?

472
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:41,119
I'm twenty-four.

473
00:30:42,279 --> 00:30:42,839
Next.

474
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:44,880
What's your name?

475
00:30:45,799 --> 00:30:46,839
I'm Shinji Katayama.

476
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,720
Japanese?

477
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,759
I'm Japanese.

478
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:53,599
That one.

479
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:55,680
Come here.

480
00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:56,440
Yes.

481
00:30:58,559 --> 00:30:59,279
Lift your head.

482
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,640
You're no longer Japanese.

483
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,640
You don't deserve it.

484
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,799
Know your place.

485
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:14,039
You deserters

486
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:14,920
are our disgrace.

487
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Here,

488
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,000
you're no different from those stupid pigs.

489
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,039
No difference at all.

490
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,359
Listen carefully.

491
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,559
You, who betrayed the Emperor,

492
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,880
will stay here

493
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,279
and spend your life repenting.

494
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,039
Here,

495
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,759
you're all the same.

496
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:55,119
Understand?

497
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,359
Understood.

498
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,000
The new guy.

499
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,199
That one over there.

500
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:22,440
Hey, you.

501
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,119
Old Tang.

502
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:29,880
Old Tang.

503
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,159
Keep your voice down.

504
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,840
Quiet! What are you saying?

505
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:34,559
It's fine. He just asked me for soup.

506
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:36,960
No soup. Just eat.

507
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:37,599
Okay, okay.

508
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:38,119
The new guy.

509
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:38,400
Yes.

510
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:38,960
Yes.

511
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,320
You're okay?

512
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,480
I was fine.

513
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,039
But you shouted.

514
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:49,000
Almost got us in trouble.

515
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,599
I thought you were dead.

516
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,599
How did you end up here?

517
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:03,360
On the way to Eight Pines.

518
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,039
Got caught by the Japanese.

519
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:06,880
What about you?

520
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:08,599
Me too.

521
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,639
So, you...

522
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:13,079
Do you have news about anyone else?

523
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,679
I was with Xiaohua.

524
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,119
We got separated in the mountains.

525
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,239
No idea how she is now.

526
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:25,239
Do you know about anyone else?

527
00:35:26,519 --> 00:35:27,480
At first,

528
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,559
I was with Yunhu.

529
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,440
Then,

530
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:33,840
The two of us

531
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,239
were tricked into Jin Gouzi.

532
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:39,039
Then we got set up.

533
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:42,239
Yunhu was buried alive.

534
00:35:58,039 --> 00:35:59,320
What about the squad leader and Xiaogui?

535
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:01,159
You have no news at all?

536
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,000
None.

537
00:36:17,559 --> 00:36:18,159
But

538
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:20,199
seeing you today

539
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,440
makes me feel a lot better.

540
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:27,840
The Japanese are capturing so many people.

541
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,480
What are they planning?

542
00:36:31,719 --> 00:36:32,599
Who knows?

543
00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:35,039
But I heard

544
00:36:36,199 --> 00:36:37,039
around here

545
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,440
there are more labor camps like this.

546
00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:40,639
About twenty or so.

547
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,559
At night, often

548
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,440
I can hear

549
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,519
explosions in the mountains.

550
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:47,400
Are they mining?

551
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,280
I haven't seen them

552
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,400
dig up anything.

553
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,400
Bastard.

554
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,960
You want to eat that badly?

555
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:03,679
You cut in line.

556
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,079
And you think you're right?

557
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,760
Wait, that's a Japanese.

558
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,800
What are you doing?

559
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,440
After working all day,

560
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:40,840
you still have energy to fight?

561
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:42,519
Me,

562
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:44,519
I have a good temper.

563
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,000
I'm kind too.

564
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,440
But all this

565
00:37:48,679 --> 00:37:50,599
is only for those who obey.

566
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,039
Answer.

567
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,440
Say yes.

568
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:57,800
Yes.

569
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,320
No next time.

570
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,519
Whatever they're up to,

571
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:08,599
we need to find a way to escape.

572
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:09,920
Get the information from here

573
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,239
and report it to our superiors.

574
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:12,679
Right.

575
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:14,280
Escape.

576
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,440
Do you have a plan?

577
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,400
No.

578
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,360
Not yet.

579
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,159
Boss.

580
00:38:58,679 --> 00:38:59,360
Boss.

581
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,159
You’re here.

582
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:30,800
Why are you here again?

583
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:32,119
I missed you.

584
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,119
Get lost.

585
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:35,079
A bear came into the yard in the first half of the night.

586
00:39:35,079 --> 00:39:36,400
It took my pickled cabbage jar.

587
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:37,559
Then in the second half of the night,

588
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:38,880
you dragged in a pig carcass.

589
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,519
Is it ever going to stop?

590
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,840
Isn’t that just perfect?

591
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,639
One goes out, one comes in.

592
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,480
As long as you don’t make me pay.

593
00:39:48,199 --> 00:39:49,639
Autumn rain brings a chill.

594
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,840
Pour me a bowl of wine, quick.

595
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,320
I need something warm.

596
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:01,800
What kind of weather is this?

597
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,960
It just keeps raining.

598
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,679
Rain is good.

599
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,519
Water brings wealth.

600
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:12,280
Enough.

601
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:14,199
Stop cooking dishes and soup.

602
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,440
Did you bring the money?

603
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:19,159
All you care about is money.

604
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:29,920
That’s not right.

605
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:31,760
I only brought what I owed last time.

606
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,559
The higher-ups are getting suspicious.

607
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,880
They asked why there were two collapses in one month.

608
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,119
Even the King of Hell can’t keep up.

609
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,079
Take it easy.

610
00:40:44,199 --> 00:40:45,559
There have been a lot of collapses.

611
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:47,719
You take a big cut too.

612
00:40:49,559 --> 00:40:51,239
I do a lot of work myself.

613
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,519
Brother.

614
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:55,320
I know you’re not easy to fool, Big Safe.

615
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,239
But still,

616
00:40:57,239 --> 00:40:58,679
We agreed on this beforehand.

617
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:02,519
I’m in charge of bringing in the living.

618
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:03,639
Dragging out the dead.

619
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:06,119
And pretending to be relatives of the dead for money.

620
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:08,320
I do just as much as you.

621
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,760
Who told you to bring them into the yard?

622
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,000
Bad luck.

623
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,199
Bad luck.

624
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,440
Everyone’s seen this kind of thing these days.

625
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,159
It’s all pure silver.

626
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:25,760
This wine—

627
00:41:26,199 --> 00:41:27,840
So soft and mellow.

628
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:29,199
Feels like little hands.

629
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,400
It’s deadly tempting.

630
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,400
Quit with the nonsense.

631
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:34,000
Can’t touch, can’t even—

632
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,280
Just want to enjoy the taste.

633
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,519
If you don’t shut up,

634
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,119
I’ll cut out your tongue.

635
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:39,039
And stuff it down your throat.

636
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:39,599
Fine.

637
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:40,960
I’ll wait for you inside.

638
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,039
Restless spirits, don't haunt me.

639
00:42:27,079 --> 00:42:28,239
Go bother whoever you're looking for.

640
00:42:31,239 --> 00:42:32,119
Let go of me.

641
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:34,000
I've seen every kind of ghost there is.

642
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:35,840
Gluttonous ghosts, starving ghosts,

643
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,079
hanged ghosts, drowned ghosts,

644
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,559
ghosts who died of illness, ghosts who froze to death,

645
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,760
even drunkards and lechers.

646
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,480
Any ghost who sees me

647
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:44,159
has to bow their head.

648
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,079
and keep their distance.

649
00:42:45,239 --> 00:42:46,480
They all steer clear of me.
