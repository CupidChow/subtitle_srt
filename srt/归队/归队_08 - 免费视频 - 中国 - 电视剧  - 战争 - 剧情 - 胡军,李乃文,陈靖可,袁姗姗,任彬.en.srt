1
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:41,879
I think you must be

2
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,480
soaked in a thousand-year-old urine jar.

3
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,519
You’ve turned into a stench spirit.

4
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,120
Always flirting with my man

5
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:46,840
and sneaking around here.

6
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,760
Watch your mouth.

7
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:49,000
That’s how I talk, so what?

8
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,319
This old lady

9
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,280
smells only of perfume.

10
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:55,760
If you don’t believe me, sniff for yourself.

11
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,239
But hitting someone is crossing the line.

12
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:02,599
If you hurt

13
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,439
my delicate, beautiful

14
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,120
soft-skinned face,

15
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:07,319
you’ll have to pay big money.

16
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,800
My shop faces south

17
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,199
and welcomes guests from everywhere.

18
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:13,599
Good wine and good food

19
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:15,360
are served to those with fate.

20
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,599
Why hasn’t that table’s food arrived yet?

21
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:19,960
Without dishes to go with it,

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,520
the wine doesn’t go down right.

23
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:22,439
I’ll go hurry it up.

24
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,520
It’s already autumn,

25
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,919
so why are these flies

26
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,080
still buzzing everywhere?

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,319
There are so many flies.

28
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:37,280
They say flies

29
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,560
don’t land on eggs without cracks.

30
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:41,719
But I don’t have any cracked eggs here.

31
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,319
That’s not right.

32
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:44,439
Cracked or not,

33
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:46,000
the stink still attracts flies, right?

34
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,039
That’s true.

35
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:49,159
Can’t keep your own man

36
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:50,639
so you come to my shop to make trouble.

37
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:53,280
If the stench draws people in,

38
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:55,719
that’s my skill.

39
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,520
Is it still wine without its aroma?

40
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:00,960
Well said.

41
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:01,560
Master Pang.

42
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,400
Master Pang.

43
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,719
I came here for that very aroma.

44
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:05,759
Hello, Master Pang.

45
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,400
Master Pang.

46
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,599
The aroma.

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,599
The aroma.

48
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:13,520
If I don’t smell it once a day,

49
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,879
I can’t even sleep at night.

50
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:16,919
What are you still looking at?

51
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:18,759
Get lost, now.

52
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,719
Break it up, move along.

53
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,159
The wine is warmed up.

54
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,240
Aren’t you going to toast me?

55
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,520
I’m afraid you’ll get drunk and delay your business.

56
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:35,879
That’s true.

57
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:37,960
Your wine here at Da Kuozhi

58
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,560
is strong enough to steal your soul.

59
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:42,800
Please enjoy.

60
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,360
I’ll go check on your food.

61
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,159
You know, this wine

62
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,639
can be drunk anywhere,

63
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:48,919
but drinking it here at Da Kuozhi

64
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,000
just feels right.

65
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:52,000
Listen to you.

66
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,639
There are so many distinguished guests today.

67
00:03:55,879 --> 00:03:56,639
How many in your party?

68
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:57,840
Boss.

69
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,520
I’m looking for Master Pang.

70
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:01,759
This way, please.

71
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,280
Master Pang.

72
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:05,360
Your guest.

73
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:08,680
Come.

74
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:13,800
Sit over there.

75
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,879
Sit down, sit.

76
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:22,720
Sorry to keep you waiting.

77
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,240
Did you see the treasure?

78
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:26,240
I’ve been searching for two or three days.

79
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,199
It’s nothing.

80
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,000
Songlin Town

81
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,480
won’t let you down.

82
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,360
There are substantial dishes.

83
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,079
Uncle.

84
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,839
We can’t keep going like this.

85
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:45,519
So,

86
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:46,720
what do you suggest?

87
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:49,240
How about heading toward Mudanjiang?

88
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,839
It’s a long way over mountains and rivers.

89
00:04:54,839 --> 00:04:56,040
Let’s not end up halfway

90
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:57,399
and lose both people and money.

91
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,519
This treasure is really hot.

92
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,439
Yeah.

93
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,399
Uncle, who do you think was tailing us that day?

94
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,759
Who was it?

95
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,399
Someone from the old ginseng shop.

96
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,480
Could be the buyer.

97
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:19,040
Trying to get something for nothing.

98
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:23,199
That’s possible too.

99
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,399
Or maybe someone else.

100
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,800
This boil will burst sooner or later.

101
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:39,360
Can't worry about all that now.

102
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,079
We have to get through this.

103
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:46,040
Gui'er,

104
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,560
Are you scared?

105
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:51,959
We in the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army fight the Japanese devils.

106
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:53,079
We'd give up our lives if we have to.

107
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,040
What's there to be afraid of?

108
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:58,439
All set.

109
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:13,199
What's up?

110
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:15,720
Not used to coming in through the door?

111
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,439
It's so late.

112
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,319
Why are you sitting here?

113
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:24,759
Go back quickly.

114
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,439
I'm not sleepy.

115
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,000
What's wrong?

116
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:29,879
Why is there blood?

117
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,120
Are you hurt?

118
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:32,439
No, I'm fine.

119
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,040
Come here.

120
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:36,360
Come in, quick.

121
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:40,680
Let me see, where are you hurt?

122
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:42,319
Don't panic, don't panic.

123
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,759
It's not my blood.

124
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:44,279
Look.

125
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:45,879
I'm perfectly fine.

126
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,839
If it's not yours, whose is it?

127
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:50,360
Those two tails on the road.

128
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:01,319
Who sent you?

129
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,839
You were targeted by You Shilong and Niqiu.

130
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:09,800
It's nothing.

131
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,240
I went out today anyway

132
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,240
to lure them out.

133
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,879
Didn't expect they'd really take the bait.

134
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:17,360
So what happened to those two tails?

135
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,720
I hit too hard, didn't leave anyone alive.

136
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,399
Well,

137
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:34,560
I thought it over on the way.

138
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,800
I can't stay here anymore.

139
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,240
I might drag you into this.

140
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,120
What?

141
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:45,399
You haven't paid for food and medicine yet.

142
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,040
And you want to leave?

143
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,079
No,

144
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:47,800
I... I'm here

145
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,079
Stop fussing.

146
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,399
No one dares

147
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:52,839
to kill someone in this old lady's place.

148
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:07,959
I'll settle this soon.

149
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:09,560
Otherwise, the two of us

150
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:10,720
really won't get any peace.

151
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,879
I really didn't expect

152
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:24,079
that this miner

153
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,879
was so tough.

154
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:27,560
He's not simple.

155
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:29,560
He was being careful.

156
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,480
These days at the Jin'gou,

157
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,240
the big gold company sent a new mine foreman.

158
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,120
Go set up the kitchen at the mine first.

159
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:41,200
We can't let our meals stop.

160
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,159
Let him rest for a couple of days.

161
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:46,120
Wait until he can't hold out anymore.

162
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,440
Then we'll take his life.

163
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:58,600
Sister, I'm here!

164
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,720
Isn't that Little Red Date?

165
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,320
Do another one!

166
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:03,080
Do another one! Do another one!

167
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,360
No singing today.

168
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:05,480
Enjoy your food and drinks.

169
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:06,480
Eat more.

170
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:07,879
Your voice arrives before you do.

171
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,799
Even a lark can't outshout you.

172
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,759
I hurried over just to see you.

173
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,399
Tell me if you want anything to eat or drink.

174
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:15,039
I need to help you regain the weight you lost.

175
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,799
I'll make sure you get it back.

176
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,080
You're home when you're here.

177
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:19,039
Seeing my big sister

178
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,159
is like seeing my own mother.

179
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,320
Am I really that old?

180
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:22,440
Can't help it, I'm just young.

181
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:23,399
Get outta here!

182
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:24,960
That's not what I meant.

183
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:26,919
I just mean seeing you feels close.

184
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:28,159
How close?

185
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,080
As close as seeing my own mom.

186
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,279
You always get the last word.

187
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,080
Come on, let's order in the kitchen.

188
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:35,600
Order some food.

189
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:35,960
Oh my goodness.

190
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:37,360
My sister really knows how to treat me.

191
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,000
You were gone for quite a while this time.

192
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:41,879
It sure wasn't short.

193
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:43,639
Was it smooth?

194
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:44,879
It was.

195
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,279
Crossed mountains and rivers.

196
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,080
Sang wherever I went.

197
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:48,879
It was great.

198
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:49,960
So free and easy.

199
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:50,679
How about you?

200
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:51,879
Your business looks really good.

201
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:52,240
Sis,

202
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,519
these days,

203
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,919
just surviving is already something.

204
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,840
They're merging villages one by one.

205
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:00,799
Burning the forests piece by piece.

206
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,360
It's so hard for ordinary folks.

207
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:03,879
Why are they burning the forests?

208
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:06,360
Those Japanese devils

209
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:08,480
got confused by the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army.

210
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:10,000
So they burn the forests.

211
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:12,159
To leave the army nowhere to hide.

212
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,440
Merging villages is to make sure people

213
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,679
lose contact with the army.

214
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,320
Now they're even burning the forests.

215
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:19,759
Japanese devils

216
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,279
are really pushing people to the brink.

217
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:22,480
Exactly.

218
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:23,879
That's why they're called devils.

219
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:25,039
So cruel.

220
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:27,039
Sis,

221
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:29,120
I heard

222
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,879
in winter,

223
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,159
the army was forced

224
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,039
to pick corn kernels out of horse manure

225
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,759
just to eat.

226
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:41,960
Our men really suffered.

227
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,440
It breaks my heart.

228
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,440
Where are you off to now?

229
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:01,159
Checking if the door's shut.

230
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:02,879
We've got guests at home.

231
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:06,799
Go tell the kitchen

232
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:09,480
to fry some tenderloin and stew a fish.

233
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,519
Stop staring.

234
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:22,639
Who is that?

235
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,039
Looks unfamiliar.

236
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:26,080
Why are you so nosy?

237
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,279
New worker.

238
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:33,480
Sis,

239
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:34,960
I'm telling you,

240
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,960
this guy has a killer vibe.

241
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:41,840
More like a silly vibe.

242
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:43,960
I'm not joking.

243
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,720
Look at the way he walks.

244
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:47,799
His legs kick up dust.

245
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:48,440
Is that normal?

246
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,639
Oh, come on.

247
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:51,759
He looks clueless.

248
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:53,799
You couldn't get a peep out of him.

249
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,440
Oh my goodness.

250
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:56,799
Be careful, will you?

251
00:11:57,399 --> 00:11:58,799
Times are so chaotic now.

252
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,679
Don't let yourself get tricked.

253
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,919
I'm just bored.

254
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:05,120
Might as well keep a monkey for fun.

255
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,320
Boss Lady,

256
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,519
you're really carefree.

257
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:17,879
All the folks from around here

258
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:20,000
All the shop owners have come

259
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:21,519
Then the two of us

260
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,759
will perform "The Western Chamber" for everyone

261
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,440
How about it?

262
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:25,039
Great

263
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:26,120
Band master

264
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,639
Please

265
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:47,039
A bright full moon

266
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:49,919
Good, good, good

267
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:51,200
Nice

268
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:00,720
Boss Huang

269
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,360
Your wine

270
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:03,720
Come, come, put it here, put it here

271
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,679
People usually drink tea while watching opera

272
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:09,799
Why are you drinking wine?

273
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:11,200
What do you know?

274
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:12,720
Tea, that stuff

275
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:13,600
The more you drink, the colder you get

276
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,159
But wine warms you up the more you drink

277
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,519
Especially

278
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:19,000
after drinking wine from Madam Da Kuozhi's place

279
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,000
It warms your heart like a heated bed

280
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:24,200
Look at you

281
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,240
Why haven't we seen Master Pang today?

282
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,559
Master Pang didn't come?

283
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:30,720
You guys don't know yet, do you?

284
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,480
Someone died at Jin'gou

285
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:33,879
What?

286
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,399
Someone died at Jin'gou

287
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,200
That's nothing unusual

288
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,279
Yeah, that's true

289
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,480
But it wasn't a laborer who died

290
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,000
It was that guy called Niqiu

291
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:42,600
Remember him?

292
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,480
He often brought workers to Jin'gou

293
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:47,559
And always skipped out on paying at restaurants

294
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:48,360
Yeah, that's right

295
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,679
He was killed

296
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:55,399
Don't talk about it, don't talk about it

297
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,360
Watch the show, watch her sing, she's so good

298
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,120
Nice, nice

299
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:12,120
Quick, quick, forgot to pay

300
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,000
Thank you, boss

301
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:14,679
See?

302
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:15,840
If you don't pay him

303
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:16,799
I'm telling you, he won't leave

304
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,600
She sings

305
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:20,159
Well

306
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,320
Good, good, good

307
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:27,360
Boss

308
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:31,320
Good news

309
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:32,919
That dead Niqiu

310
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:34,279
He's really gone this time

311
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:35,759
What do you mean?

312
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:37,679
Didn't I just deliver wine?

313
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,039
A few bosses said so

314
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,080
Are you sure it was Niqiu who died?

315
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,679
How would I know?

316
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,480
There's no smoke without fire

317
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:07,559
Master Pang

318
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:08,639
Master Pang

319
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:09,840
Master Pang

320
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,960
You didn't go to the opera?

321
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:12,120
Give me some.

322
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,919
Are you blind?

323
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,639
Master Pang

324
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,559
You're busy with official matters.

325
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:18,879
You're really busy.

326
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,200
Don't make a fuss for nothing.

327
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:22,200
Go on.

328
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,320
Zhi'er

329
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:28,279
Master Pang

330
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:29,039
Here he comes.

331
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,360
Master Pang is here.

332
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,120
I'm here to support you.

333
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:33,200
Sit over there.

334
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,559
Only you care about my business.

335
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,679
What can I do?

336
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:42,600
You're all I think about.

337
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,039
You've got a big heart.

338
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:46,679
As long as I have you, it's enough.

339
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:49,759
It's another last meal.

340
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,960
What crime did he commit?

341
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:54,000
Murder.

342
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:54,799
Why?

343
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,080
Why do you care?

344
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,399
You kill, you pay with your life.

345
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:58,840
Same old rules.

346
00:15:59,320 --> 00:15:59,919
Food and drink, all you want.

347
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,600
Feed him well before he goes.

348
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:02,960
I'll take care of it.

349
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,000
Drink at the gate between life and death.

350
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,519
Lean on the ghost gate and think about life.

351
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,559
If you ask why,

352
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,200
I came to the Guandong Mountains.

353
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:19,840
Back home, there was no food, no work.

354
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:22,360
My parents died, no coffin for them.

355
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,679
I heard there are gold mountains in Guandong.

356
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:27,000
Black earth squeezes out oil.

357
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:29,320
Scoop the water, get a ladle of fish.

358
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:31,480
Lie on the kang, there's hot wine.

359
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,120
No need for idle talk.

360
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:35,279
Get out.

361
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,759
I dove straight into the Guandong Mountains.

362
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:39,120
White mountains, black waters, good times.

363
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,960
Met Niqiu, who led me.

364
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,080
Came to Jin'gou, picked up the bowl.

365
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:47,399
If you have mountains, you live off them.

366
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,799
If you have water, you live off it.

367
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:50,919
But holding Jin'gou,

368
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Why can't I get a golden bowl?

369
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,320
Gold water flows and flows.

370
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:57,360
But never reaches me.

371
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,120
Work myself to death for half a meal.

372
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:02,679
Niqiu didn't bring me to the gold mountain.

373
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:04,400
Why are you here? Hide quickly.

374
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,759
Pang Sihai is here.

375
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:08,599
One careless move and you lose your life.

376
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:11,359
Every wrong has its culprit.

377
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,920
Heaven can forgive me for killing Niqiu.

378
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,079
The authorities came and arrested me.

379
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:17,720
Pity me.

380
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:20,519
So much grievance, nowhere to tell.

381
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,359
Just blame my bad luck.

382
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:25,960
Born in a rotten world.

383
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,640
Father, mother,

384
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,720
Your son is here.

385
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:32,559
Stop crying.

386
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:37,680
You guys,

387
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,319
Who will do it?

388
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,640
Third brother, it's your turn.

389
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,559
My father's birthday is coming.

390
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:46,000
I need my hand.

391
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,119
To hold the birthday peach for him.

392
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,680
Fourth brother, you do it.

393
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,759
My wife is about to give birth.

394
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,319
I need my hand to hold my son.

395
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,160
Go, go, go.

396
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:57,079
Big brother,

397
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,880
I fed him last time.

398
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:00,319
Can't always be just me.

399
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:00,880
It's trouble.

400
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,519
I fed him last time too.

401
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,359
He served the food, I poured the wine.

402
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:06,240
What do you mean?

403
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,440
I have to do it myself?

404
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:12,839
Is that what you mean?

405
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:19,440
Raising a bunch of ungrateful wolves like you,

406
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:20,720
Let me do it.

407
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:23,079
Zhi'er.

408
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,240
No, no.

409
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:25,920
This isn't something you should do.

410
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:27,359
Why not?

411
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:28,799
We're all human.

412
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,319
Born from a mother's womb.

413
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:31,680
Life and death, that's all.

414
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,119
If I can see him off,

415
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:35,480
it's a good deed.

416
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:39,400
Look at the grace of Madam Da Kuozhi.

417
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,039
Now look at you lot.

418
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:43,119
You're nothing.

419
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:58,039
Come.

420
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:08,039
Brother,

421
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:10,440
Is there anything else on your mind?

422
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,559
Just say it.

423
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:20,079
I'll take care of it for you.

424
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:25,519
Don't be shy.

425
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,599
Boss lady,

426
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,440
To have this meal before I die,

427
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:36,599
it's worth it.

428
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:40,319
The kindness you've shown me in this life,

429
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,079
I can't repay it.

430
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,119
All I can do is thank you.

431
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:51,480
I have a brother.

432
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:53,400
He asked me to pass you a message.

433
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:57,839
You helped him kill his enemy.

434
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,599
He wants to thank you.

435
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:02,240
He also said,

436
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,960
what you did was a good deed.

437
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,119
Go in peace.

438
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,279
One more thing.

439
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:19,920
After I die,

440
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,000
please throw me into the river.

441
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:24,960
I'm afraid of being eaten by wild dogs.

442
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,759
Leave it to me.

443
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:32,200
I'll make sure that brother does it right.

444
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:40,359
Anyone left in your family?

445
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:43,000
I can write a letter for you.

446
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,279
No need.

447
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,519
Oh, right.

448
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:51,559
My leg isn't good.

449
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:54,119
When the time comes,

450
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,519
please be careful.

451
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:06,200
This food I made,

452
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:07,880
does it suit your taste?

453
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,000
Why are we chatting so much?

454
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:13,960
How about a drink?

455
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:15,160
I think you're bad luck.

456
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,640
A few more bites, a sip of wine,

457
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:23,519
then I'll go.

458
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:35,880
I'm leaving.

459
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:41,319
Master Pang, wait a moment.

460
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:42,839
He's still breathing, isn't he?

461
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,880
Why are you in such a rush?

462
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:44,640
Master Pang.

463
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,279
I know the rules.

464
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,200
I have to show you respect.

465
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,079
Hurry up.

466
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:53,480
Brother, brother!

467
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,240
Don't go, don't go!

468
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,559
Hey, big brother,

469
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,920
I'm the owner of this coffin shop.

470
00:21:58,279 --> 00:22:00,079
You really overestimate me.

471
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,960
Look at my clothes.

472
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:04,400
Do I look like someone who can afford a coffin?

473
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:09,119
Your gold teeth,

474
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:10,799
could be traded for a coffin.

475
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,799
A coffin as thick as a finger.

476
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,599
Wait till I close my eyes,

477
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,519
then pull them out.

478
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,240
Put them in your pocket, how nice.

479
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,519
The graves are packed tight at the burial ground.

480
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:26,599
Shoulder to shoulder.

481
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:29,880
With my build, I can't compete.

482
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:30,839
True.

483
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,000
If you get hurt fighting for a spot,

484
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:35,279
and lose your life,

485
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,559
it's not worth it.

486
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:46,960
Thanks.

487
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:48,119
Thank you.

488
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:50,440
Blockhead.

489
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:52,480
What's in your head?

490
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,119
You think you'll get those gold teeth?

491
00:22:54,759 --> 00:22:55,640
Already checked.

492
00:22:56,279 --> 00:22:57,039
They're fake.

493
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:57,880
Let's go.

494
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,400
Brother,

495
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:43,880
we really are connected by fate.

496
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:46,839
The man you killed

497
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,720
was also my enemy.

498
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:52,960
You did what I always wanted to do.

499
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,079
I respect you as a real man.

500
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:01,559
I don't know what I can do for you.

501
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:04,799
Let me see you off one last time.

502
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,240
You've suffered a lot in this life.

503
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,119
In your next life,

504
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,920
try to be born into a good family.

505
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:17,359
I won't say more.

506
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:19,599
Rest in peace.

507
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,160
Did he say anything else?

508
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:33,440
He told me his leg was bad.

509
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:34,559
He asked me to be careful.

510
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,599
I mean, he's about to die,

511
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,119
does it matter if his leg is bad or not?

512
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,079
What difference does it make?

513
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,359
Brother,

514
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:08,880
forgive me.

515
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,599
What do you want from me?

516
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,240
Come in, come in.

517
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:16,480
Come on.

518
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:18,359
What are you doing?

519
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,400
What's that strong smell?

520
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:47,720
Gold.

521
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,799
Mudfish got what he deserved.

522
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,839
But this person...

523
00:26:54,839 --> 00:26:55,720
It's pitiful.

524
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,200
Anything else?

525
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:05,839
Put this away.

526
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,720
This draws too much attention.

527
00:27:08,839 --> 00:27:10,000
Make sure you hide it well.

528
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:11,960
You gave it to me.

529
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,079
It was yours to begin with.

530
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:15,759
What is it?

531
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:17,880
I took up your table.

532
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,680
Ate your food and drank your wine.

533
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,039
I should show some gratitude.

534
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:24,160
Just for this?

535
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,119
Is your life only worth this much?

536
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,599
Fine, say whatever you want.

537
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,400
Hurry up and put it away.

538
00:27:38,599 --> 00:27:40,240
Someone who isn't greedy for money—

539
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,720
I've never met one in my life.

540
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:48,839
You're honest.

541
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,599
I have to be fair too.

542
00:27:52,119 --> 00:27:53,759
Shoulder to shoulder, equal.

543
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:54,920
That's how it feels right.

544
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:44,880
Who is it?

545
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,119
It's me, Mr. Park from the ginseng shop.

546
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,160
Coming.

547
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:53,480
Mr. Park.

548
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,039
It's so late at night.

549
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,119
Do you have...

550
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,279
Could we talk inside for a moment?

551
00:28:59,319 --> 00:28:59,839
Sure.

552
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,200
Please.

553
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,440
There's news.

554
00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:17,640
That's really interesting.

555
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,000
I've delivered the message.

556
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,480
This has nothing to do with me.

557
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
You guys talk among yourselves.

558
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:26,279
You need to help me keep an eye out, right?

559
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:29,279
Your eyes are sharper than mine.

560
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,680
Stop joking around.

561
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:33,160
Alright.

562
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:35,599
Watch your step.

563
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:39,440
Let me say it again.

564
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:40,599
This matter has

565
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,160
absolutely nothing to do with me.

566
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,119
Stop coming to me about this.

567
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,680
I'm just an ordinary businessman.

568
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,680
If you keep saying that,

569
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,160
it makes me really anxious.

570
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,319
I'm so anxious I can't even sleep.

571
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:58,920
Take care.

572
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,200
Guys, you soak for a while.

573
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:40,920
I'm heading out first.

574
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:17,279
Why are you staring at me?

575
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,519
Weren't you the one staring at me first?

576
00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:24,000
Ever since you walked in,

577
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,839
your eyes haven't stopped moving.

578
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,279
You look at everyone you see.

579
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:29,519
What's up?

580
00:31:29,799 --> 00:31:30,839
Is this your first time at the bathhouse?

581
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,720
Everyone's naked here.

582
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:35,680
Why can't people look?

583
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:36,319
Well...

584
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:37,400
Go ahead and look.

585
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,400
Look all you want.

586
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:39,839
If you want, come over and look.

587
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:40,759
Come on.

588
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,200
Forget it then.

589
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,680
You're the one who asked me to meet.

590
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,000
But you're always hiding and never show up.

591
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,279
A man who breaks his word isn't honorable.

592
00:31:57,759 --> 00:31:59,799
Changing your mind all the time gets annoying.

593
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,799
Stop making a fuss.

594
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:05,839
Come in and get a scrub, cool off.

595
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,319
Lie down.

596
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:29,000
What are you staring at?

597
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,839
Sorry about that.

598
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:34,599
Kept you waiting.

599
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:36,880
You mean a bath scrub?

600
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:41,119
You didn't plan on getting a scrub at first.

601
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:43,160
So you were hiding here.

602
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:43,640
Me?

603
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,079
Where are you from?

604
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:50,240
From Mudanjiang.

605
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,680
That place?

606
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:54,920
I've been there.

607
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:55,839
Really?

608
00:32:57,799 --> 00:32:59,519
I've even crossed Sanbao Bridge.

609
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:00,960
Where?

610
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:03,599
I've never heard of Sanbao Bridge.

611
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:06,359
Maybe I remembered wrong.

612
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:11,440
Maybe.

613
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,599
What brings you here?

614
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,400
Looking for treasure.

615
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:21,319
Just here for treasure?

616
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:23,839
My mother is seriously ill.

617
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,799
I'm waiting for the right medicine.

618
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:31,559
You're a real filial child.

619
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,920
Of course.

620
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,839
So chubby and healthy.

621
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,039
What do you do?

622
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:38,480
Are you...

623
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,000
You're asking a bit too much.

624
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,599
I'm giving you a free scrub.

625
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,400
Can't I?

626
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,359
Just making small talk.

627
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,680
Go ahead, talk.

628
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,279
But don't press my head so hard.

629
00:33:48,279 --> 00:33:48,799
Take it easy.

630
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:50,759
Put more strength on my back.

631
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:51,599
Alright.

632
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:53,839
Alright, alright, alright.

633
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,759
Okay, where's the treasure?

634
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,000
Did you bring enough money?

635
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,279
Wouldn't come here without being prepared.

636
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,000
That's good to hear.

637
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,360
Alright, alright, let's go.

638
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,320
Forget it, forget it.

639
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,320
You're scrubbing too hard.

640
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,599
Just tell me

641
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:17,760
how much it costs,

642
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,760
where to deliver,

643
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,199
and when to deliver, that's all.

644
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:22,760
Straightforward.

645
00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:29,400
Otherwise, we're just in a bathhouse.

646
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,519
As they were speaking,

647
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,239
a boat appeared on the river.

648
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:48,159
A large red flag fluttered in the wind.

649
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:48,840
On it,

650
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:51,599
was a big character "Guan".

651
00:34:52,039 --> 00:34:54,039
The big boat drew closer and closer.

652
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:57,639
They saw Guan Yu, Guan Yunchang,

653
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,360
wearing a green headscarf and blue robe,

654
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:01,039
sitting on the boat.

655
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:02,280
Beside him was Zhou Cang,

656
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,639
holding the Green Dragon Crescent Blade.

657
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:06,159
On this side,

658
00:35:06,519 --> 00:35:08,760
Lu Su was looking on.

659
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,039
He thought to himself,

660
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,920
how could Guan Yunchang

661
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,480
come over with just a few men?

662
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,199
His courage

663
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:19,440
was bigger than a watermelon.

664
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:23,800
Man,

665
00:35:25,719 --> 00:35:27,280
the horses and money you wanted,

666
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,679
I've brought them all.

667
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,559
Show yourself.

668
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:34,360
Being careful can catch cicadas for ages,

669
00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:36,719
but if you're too cautious,

670
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:38,239
the cicada will fly away.

671
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,239
Let me remind you again,

672
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:42,519
in Songlin Town,

673
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:44,239
if I don't take that treasure,

674
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,320
it'll rot in your hands.

675
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,320
Stop making a fuss.

676
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,840
Show me the silver.

677
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,440
Keep your eyes sharp.

678
00:35:56,719 --> 00:35:57,800
Look carefully.

679
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,840
It's not silver.

680
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:02,039
They're real gold bars.

681
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:06,719
Take nine steps forward.

682
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,079
One step

683
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:17,199
Two steps, three steps, four steps

684
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,079
Five steps, six steps, seven steps

685
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:20,880
Eight steps

686
00:36:21,559 --> 00:36:22,920
Nine steps, that's all

687
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,079
What's next?

688
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,119
In a flash

689
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,719
The big boat docks

690
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:33,159
Guan Yu steps off the boat steadily

691
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,599
You brat, you're no good

692
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,840
No, no, sir, really

693
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:40,480
You're not being loyal

694
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:42,320
This is outright robbery

695
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,320
You call this loyalty?

696
00:36:43,639 --> 00:36:44,199
Me

697
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:49,039
Behind the tree

698
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:50,199
In the grass patch

699
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:52,000
Stop hiding

700
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:53,960
All of you, come out now

701
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:56,760
When Lu Su saw this

702
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,320
His legs went weak

703
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,519
He steadied himself

704
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,480
Thinking to himself

705
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:06,760
I've set up this trap

706
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:07,880
If you're a dragon

707
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,320
You have to coil up

708
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:11,320
If you're a tiger, you have to crouch

709
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,960
Guan Yun Chang

710
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:16,159
Even if you had three heads and six arms

711
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,039
What good would it do?

712
00:37:18,039 --> 00:37:18,679
Buddy

713
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,800
You've got sharp eyes

714
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:23,280
That's thanks to dealing with thieves

715
00:37:23,559 --> 00:37:24,360
Your men

716
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:27,480
Step back 150 meters

717
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:28,920
Or I'll shoot

718
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,599
And blow your head off

719
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,480
No, no, wait

720
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,719
Step back

721
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,639
Didn't you hear me? Move back

722
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:38,599
Buddy

723
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,039
Do whatever you want with that guy

724
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,599
As long as you leave the ginseng

725
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:44,079
And the money for me

726
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,880
I'll let you live today

727
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:48,480
Burning bridges after crossing, huh?

728
00:37:48,679 --> 00:37:49,360
Boss Li

729
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:50,480
Sorry about this

730
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,920
We still have to go back

731
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,519
And report to Master Si

732
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:54,719
Me

733
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,280
I have to say, you're popular

734
00:37:56,559 --> 00:37:57,280
Not bad at all

735
00:37:58,159 --> 00:37:58,639
No

736
00:37:58,719 --> 00:37:59,280
Sir

737
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,840
Eight gold bars

738
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,239
You can take them all

739
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:05,639
Just spare my life

740
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,519
Sir

741
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:08,360
You've only got one pistol

742
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,039
Look

743
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,480
How many brothers we've got

744
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,280
Why do you think

745
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:14,719
I'm alone here?

746
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:16,679
Are you trying to scare me?

747
00:38:17,039 --> 00:38:17,840
If you've got guts

748
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:20,159
Step forward and try

749
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,119
Guys

750
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,320
Next shot

751
00:38:28,519 --> 00:38:30,719
Aim for their heads

752
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,039
Are you backing off or not?

753
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,639
Go, go, go, move!

754
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:38,840
Serves you right

755
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:43,480
Sir

756
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:44,960
Your weapon

757
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,039
Careful, don't let it go off

758
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:46,800
Go

759
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,480
Go, go, go

760
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,000
Have you backed off enough?

761
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,760
I can't really tell

762
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:09,239
More than enough

763
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:12,960
Come down

764
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:18,480
See?

765
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:18,960
Me

766
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,119
Your treasure

767
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,159
It's up in the tree

768
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,159
When you wake up

769
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,280
Go get it yourself

770
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:27,599
With that

771
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,559
Guan Yu let go of Lu Su

772
00:39:30,679 --> 00:39:31,840
And boarded the big boat

773
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:34,280
Patting his belly, he said

774
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,000
Good wine and good food

775
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,360
All of it

776
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:38,480
Has stuffed me full

777
00:39:39,159 --> 00:39:41,079
Thank you, Commander, for your hospitality

778
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:43,880
Uncle

779
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:52,000
Uncle

780
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:54,079
Let's take a break.

781
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:54,760
What's up?

782
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,119
My butt's about to fall apart.

783
00:39:59,079 --> 00:39:59,840
Our next step,

784
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:02,039
is to head straight for Ba Kesong.

785
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,880
It'd be faster if we rode horses.

786
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:04,800
No way.

787
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,599
It's bound to be trouble along the way.

788
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:08,039
Riding horses would draw too much attention.

789
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:09,199
And also,

790
00:40:09,639 --> 00:40:10,480
we need to hide the gold bars

791
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,559
properly.

792
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,119
This time,

793
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,360
we've got money to build a team.

794
00:40:17,559 --> 00:40:18,280
Let's rest up ahead.

795
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,960
Hang in there a bit longer.

796
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,360
After saying that,

797
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,119
the red flag waved,

798
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,480
and the big ship sailed with the wind,

799
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:28,760
disappearing on the river.

800
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:30,000
Alright.

801
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:31,159
Alright, alright.

802
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,599
Good.

803
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,639
Good, my ass.

804
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,440
At least it's better than losing the wild ginseng.

805
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,639
So many gold bars,

806
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:47,480
and all we got was this root.

807
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,840
Even now, when I think about it,

808
00:40:50,039 --> 00:40:51,519
my heart feels suffocated.

809
00:40:52,039 --> 00:40:53,599
It's not just a root.

810
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:56,639
It's wild ginseng, wild ginseng!

811
00:40:57,159 --> 00:40:58,159
Treasure.

812
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:58,960
Treasure.

813
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,639
Let me see your treasure.

814
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,239
Come here, come on.

815
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:11,119
Come here.

816
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:13,960
I won't hit you.

817
00:41:16,039 --> 00:41:17,159
Come here.

818
00:41:22,119 --> 00:41:23,000
Can you eat it,

819
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,039
or drink it?

820
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,159
Will chewing it fill you up?

821
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Easy there.

822
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:29,559
You...

823
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:30,800
You, you...

824
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,360
What did Master Pang tell me?

825
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,559
He said it wouldn't cost anything,

826
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:36,119
and we'd get a big treasure.

827
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,920
He calculated it all so well.

828
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,159
But in the end,

829
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:43,840
my money's gone.

830
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,239
Isn't this just

831
00:41:45,239 --> 00:41:46,920
trying to steal a chicken but losing the rice?

832
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,280
And not just a handful,

833
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:50,159
but a whole basket.

834
00:41:51,159 --> 00:41:52,679
How did we fail to steal it?

835
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:55,079
Isn't it sitting right here?

836
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,159
We paid for this.

837
00:41:59,239 --> 00:42:00,960
So we didn't lose out.

838
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:03,079
If I resell it,

839
00:42:03,079 --> 00:42:04,480
maybe I'll get a good price.

840
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:07,119
Now you've learned to talk back to me.

841
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:17,679
You don't know anything, you old woman.

842
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,800
You're nothing.

843
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,239
Saw the treasure.

844
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,039
Last night was a bust.

845
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:34,400
That ginseng seller is pretty sly.

846
00:42:35,239 --> 00:42:36,639
Don't be anxious.

847
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:40,000
Sooner or later, they'll come looking for you.

848
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,199
I think this time,

849
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:46,800
you need to send me more people.

850
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:49,599
It's not that simple.

851
00:42:50,199 --> 00:42:50,960
Relax.

852
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,280
Once it's done,

853
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,519
you'll definitely get your share.

854
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,360
It's truly a treasure.
