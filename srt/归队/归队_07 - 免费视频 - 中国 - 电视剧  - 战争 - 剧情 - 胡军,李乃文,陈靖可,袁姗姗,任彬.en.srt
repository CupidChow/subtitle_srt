1
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:42,920
Japanese soldiers

2
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,560
They want to bury us alive.

3
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,319
So we have to escape.

4
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,519
Do you have a plan?

5
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,560
In a couple of days,

6
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:56,920
it's the Japanese Autumn Festival.

7
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,519
Security will be relaxed that day.

8
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:03,239
When the day comes,

9
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:04,200
I'll figure something out.

10
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,200
First, I'll blow up their fuel depot.

11
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,560
Then, in the chaos,

12
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,039
I'll take their transport truck

13
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,360
and come pick you up.

14
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,759
What about us?

15
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,280
What can we do?

16
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,560
There are four watchtowers here.

17
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,520
Each watchtower

18
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:22,360
has two guards during the day.

19
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:25,240
At night, only one guard.

20
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:29,199
There are two guards at the main gate.

21
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:32,719
You take care of

22
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:35,319
the watchtower and gate guards.

23
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,039
That's our chance to break out.

24
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:41,199
Got it.

25
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,520
Don't worry.

26
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,840
What about weapons?

27
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,000
I'll handle that.

28
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,759
What are you doing?

29
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:16,199
We're here to say goodbye.

30
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:17,319
Goodbye?

31
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:19,759
You're running away?

32
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:20,599
Don't shout.

33
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Can you take me with you?

34
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:25,280
Please, I'm begging you.

35
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,599
It's not up to me.

36
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:28,479
You have to ask him.

37
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:31,080
Take me with you, please.

38
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,280
You're Japanese.

39
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,960
They won't do anything to you.

40
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,080
No.

41
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,560
We're all laborers.

42
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:39,800
The big pit is right outside.

43
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:41,639
I want to live too.

44
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:44,080
Please, take me with you.

45
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,560
Please, let me go with you.

46
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,439
I'm begging you.

47
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,800
Maybe we should take him.

48
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:57,680
Please.

49
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,759
Let me ask you something.

50
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:00,280
Okay.

51
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,680
What does this mean?

52
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,719
No open flames allowed.

53
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:13,639
No open flames, no open flames.

54
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,520
Fire is forbidden.

55
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:17,480
Where this is written,

56
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,040
is it the fuel depot?

57
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,480
It must be.

58
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,160
It's definitely the fuel depot.

59
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,160
We're planning to blow up the fuel depot.

60
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,000
Blow up the fuel depot?

61
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:30,480
No, no way.

62
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,040
No.

63
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,000
Why not?

64
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,079
Military fuel depots

65
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:36,639
are all underground.

66
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,879
The main gate is very strong.

67
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,360
And heavily guarded.

68
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:48,879
Underground fuel depot.

69
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,480
To prevent pressure explosions,

70
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:52,120
they have ventilation shafts.

71
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,720
What's that?

72
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,279
Ventilation shaft.

73
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:56,920
Ventilation, ventilation.

74
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,120
Ventilation shaft.

75
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,399
Ventilation shaft.

76
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,399
We can use the ventilation shaft.

77
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,360
Explosives.

78
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:07,639
That's a good idea.

79
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:10,800
Sounds good.

80
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,519
Looks like you're useful after all.

81
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,639
Most importantly,

82
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:16,720
I speak Japanese.

83
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,439
What are you doing?

84
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,839
Are you fully recovered?

85
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:46,720
You can't just keep eating for free.

86
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,800
It's not up to you to say if you're better.

87
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:49,959
You have to listen to the doctor.

88
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:53,319
Looks like it's going to rain today.

89
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:54,839
By the way,

90
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,319
Before your papers are ready,

91
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,399
don't go out yet.

92
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,600
There are too many gossiping drinkers in the front yard.

93
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,680
Got it.

94
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:10,240
Boss

95
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:12,600
Boss

96
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:17,959
Boss

97
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:19,800
Coming.

98
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,879
What are you busy with?

99
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,319
You're here alone?

100
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,519
That's right.

101
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:34,199
I'm the only one who still thinks of you.

102
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:36,639
Last time I lost my goods here.

103
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,759
Who would dare come again?

104
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:40,279
If you want to scam me, just say it.

105
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,000
Is this ever going to end?

106
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,120
That's not what I mean.

107
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,720
They're them, I'm me.

108
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,399
Only I, Liu Dabiao, know

109
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,160
Madam Kuo is someone in Songlin Town.

110
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,399
Xiao Tongtui, bring a jar of wine.

111
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,800
Coming!

112
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,439
Boss.

113
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:01,839
Take it home to drink.

114
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:09,079
I bring you money and you chase me away.

115
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,600
Fine.

116
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,720
I won't come next time either.

117
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:29,399
Don't move.

118
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,000
Take me to Jin Gou.

119
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,679
Go—go where?

120
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:37,080
Going now.

121
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:38,120
Brother.

122
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,279
Wait, can I pull up my pants first?

123
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,120
Stop talking.

124
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,759
We're here.

125
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:09,200
Jin Gou.

126
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:11,480
Brother.

127
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:20,279
Gouzi.

128
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:21,519
Wake up.

129
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:22,559
What's up?

130
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:23,200
There's a cart coming from afar.

131
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,320
A cart?

132
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,480
Can you see whose it is?

133
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:29,320
Looks like Liu Biao's cart.

134
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:30,240
Liu Biao.

135
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:31,240
Alright, got it.

136
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:46,559
Biaozi.

137
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,919
You're still picking people up this late?

138
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:11,720
What?

139
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,120
Don't recognize me?

140
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,360
Who?

141
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:23,039
You—You.

142
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:23,679
Don't shout.

143
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,879
You're still alive?

144
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:27,960
You're alive?

145
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,759
Couldn't help it.

146
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:30,759
Tough luck.

147
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:31,879
Where's my brother?

148
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,679
Ran—he ran.

149
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:34,960
He really ran.

150
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:35,840
Really ran.

151
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,039
Ran faster than a rabbit.

152
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:40,399
Know why I'm here for you?

153
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,279
I—I know.

154
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:44,960
That wasn't my fault.

155
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:47,600
It was Niqiu who wanted you dead.

156
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:49,279
Besides Niqiu?

157
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,039
Also—

158
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,039
You Shilong.

159
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,200
Where's You Shilong?

160
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:54,879
No idea where.

161
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:00,519
I've never seen You Shilong's face.

162
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:02,360
Every time I meet him,

163
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,679
he's always disguised.

164
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,080
Never seen his face.

165
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,000
And,

166
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:12,000
he talks like an actor.

167
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,879
He's always in Songlin Town.

168
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:18,240
I only meet with Niqiu.

169
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:19,399
Hero, I swear—

170
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:22,120
If I lie even half a word,

171
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:23,799
may lightning strike me.

172
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:24,759
Enough talk.

173
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,799
You'll get struck sooner or later.

174
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:28,480
Where's Niqiu?

175
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:29,720
Who?

176
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,120
Let you taste it too.

177
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,399
See what it's like to suffocate.

178
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:11,080
Thought it was all settled.

179
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,480
Slipped away fast.

180
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:13,679
Ran off.

181
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,120
No way.

182
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:16,919
What kind of person is that?

183
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:19,879
Just barely healed.

184
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,399
Couldn't stay put.

185
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:24,840
Had to get some air.

186
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,480
Besides, things aren't done yet.

187
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,360
Where are you headed?

188
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:29,759
You Shilong.

189
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:31,360
He's almost become your obsession.

190
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:33,320
How many years now?

191
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:36,039
His name's everywhere in Songlin Town.

192
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:38,120
But no one's ever seen him.

193
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:41,039
In the mountains, in the rivers—

194
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:42,360
In Songlin Town—

195
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:45,559
Maybe even in my tavern.

196
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:49,480
You know,

197
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:51,799
You actually look a lot like him.

198
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,039
Then just take me in.

199
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,559
I may not know

200
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:05,639
where You Shilong is,

201
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,399
but the way he died,

202
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,240
I’ll never forget it as long as I live.

203
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,600
The fact that you survived

204
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:11,960
means heaven was watching over you.

205
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,320
Don’t push your luck with heaven.

206
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,159
Once you close your eyes,

207
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:17,159
you can’t come back, no matter how much you want to.

208
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:18,600
I told you,

209
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:19,960
if You Shilong doesn’t die,

210
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,000
more people will die.

211
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:22,200
If I kill him,

212
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,320
it’s not just for myself.

213
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:25,279
Don’t worry.

214
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,600
Heaven sees everything clearly.

215
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:29,639
It won’t take my life.

216
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:34,600
What are you doing?

217
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:37,960
You smell like a silly deer.

218
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,080
Boss,

219
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,039
I’m here.

220
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,080
Uncle.

221
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:01,840
Boss.

222
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,519
This is a real catch!

223
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,399
My dad went after this big zheluo fish

224
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,080
for more than ten miles.

225
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,840
He nearly fell apart doing it.

226
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,879
Say no more.

227
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:11,039
I’ll take this fish.

228
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:12,720
I’ll pay whatever it’s worth.

229
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:14,080
Just name your price.

230
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:15,919
You mean

231
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,000
you want us

232
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:18,120
to eat the fish ourselves?

233
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,200
Look at my mouth.

234
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,480
I’m telling you,

235
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,559
I’m buying this fish.

236
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:27,159
I won’t shortchange you two.

237
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,480
Got it.

238
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,600
Boss, you’re straightforward.

239
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,759
If we get anything good in the future,

240
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,840
we’ll bring it to you.

241
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,559
Alright.

242
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:34,519
Boss.

243
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:35,279
Then I’ll head back.

244
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,399
Take care.

245
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,240
Madam Kuo,

246
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,679
Proprietor,

247
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,759
Could you stew this fish for us?

248
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:48,279
I’ve got two friends to treat.

249
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:48,840
How about it?

250
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:56,720
Money?

251
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,840
I know.

252
00:14:59,159 --> 00:14:59,919
The usual rules.

253
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:01,000
Put it on my tab.

254
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:03,360
I’ll settle it next time.

255
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:05,480
If you want fish,

256
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:07,080
pay off your old bar tab first.

257
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,919
Settle all your debts.

258
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,320
Then I’ll stew the fish for you right away.

259
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:13,120
Boss, you’re really joking.

260
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:14,360
Me, Niqiu,

261
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,799
when have I ever let you down?

262
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,080
If I don’t come by for a couple days,

263
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,679
I really start to miss it.

264
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:19,320
Chief Pang is here!

265
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:20,720
Chief Pang is here!

266
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:22,960
Looks like my food suits your taste.

267
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,960
You like what I serve.

268
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:24,720
Of course.

269
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,320
Mostly because you’re good people.

270
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:27,799
Come on in.

271
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,039
Xiao Tongtui,

272
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,679
save this fish for me.

273
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,799
I’m definitely having it.

274
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,279
Chief Pang

275
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:44,840
This is freshly brewed wine.

276
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,159
Please have a taste.

277
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,679
See if it suits your taste.

278
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:50,720
Let me tell you something.

279
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:53,480
Lately,

280
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,759
Songlin Town hasn't been peaceful.

281
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,120
What's going on?

282
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,519
I heard Jin Batou

283
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,080
was killed at the mine.

284
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:07,519
Liu Dabiao, the carter, has disappeared.

285
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:11,480
What do you mean, disappeared?

286
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:14,279
No sign of him alive or dead.

287
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:20,039
Maybe the bandits got him.

288
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,320
So,

289
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,559
you need to be extra careful.

290
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:28,519
With you here, Chief Pang,

291
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,360
what do I need to worry about?

292
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,559
I like the sound of that.

293
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:35,559
Yes, with me here,

294
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,559
Songlin Town

295
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,559
is safe, nothing will go wrong.

296
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,279
That's right.

297
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:40,080
As long as I'm here,

298
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:41,960
your business at night is safe too.

299
00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:43,960
You can rest assured.

300
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:46,159
Chief Pang is truly Chief Pang.

301
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:47,120
Those words

302
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,600
almost brought tears to my eyes.

303
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:50,840
Proprietor

304
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:53,600
Chief Pang

305
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,080
Just got a big zheluo fish.

306
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:56,639
It's a real delicacy.

307
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:57,519
I

308
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,480
will pair it with some wild mushrooms for you.

309
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:01,039
I'll send it to your residence later.

310
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,200
Take your time and stew it.

311
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,399
Well,

312
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:04,640
isn't this

313
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,119
a loss for you?

314
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,160
I feel bad about it.

315
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,519
If you don't get to eat this fish,

316
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,079
I'll feel even worse.

317
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,519
Such sweet words

318
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:16,039
warm the heart.

319
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,720
Alright then,

320
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,039
I'll accept it.

321
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,759
Xiao Tongtui

322
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:23,920
Take it to Chief Pang's residence later.

323
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:24,680
Got it.

324
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,640
I'll go check on your food.

325
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,119
That's great.

326
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:51,640
Sis

327
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,880
Don't call me sis.

328
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:54,319
You're older than me.

329
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:57,000
Alright, big sister.

330
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,680
Thank you for saving my life.

331
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:02,440
You were just lucky.

332
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,480
You made it through.

333
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,119
Big sister,

334
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:08,160
I'm rough and not good with words,

335
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:09,799
but my heart is true.

336
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:12,720
Anyone who's good to me, anyone who helps me,

337
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,279
I'll never forget it in my life.

338
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,039
Hearing you say that,

339
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:19,160
I know you're an honest person.

340
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,559
But I only treat good people honestly.

341
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,160
Lao San

342
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:30,680
How did you end up in the mountains?

343
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,839
The Japanese soldiers forced me.

344
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:36,440
Can you tell me about it?

345
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,559
Those Japanese soldiers,

346
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:42,759
weren't they carrying out the forced relocation policy?

347
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:44,279
I refused to leave.

348
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:45,920
They set my house on fire.

349
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,880
Burned my home down.

350
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,920
My mother was already very sick.

351
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,119
After all that trouble,

352
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,039
with all the shock and the fire,

353
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:57,200
she died.

354
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:01,799
I couldn't swallow that anger.

355
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,759
I grabbed a pickaxe.

356
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:05,079
And struck down one of the Japanese soldiers.

357
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,480
That stirred up a hornet's nest.

358
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:11,279
The rest of them all came after me.

359
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:12,799
My father told me to run.

360
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:14,799
But I thought,

361
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:16,720
If I run, what about my father?

362
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,599
So I dragged my father along.

363
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:21,599
But he couldn't run fast.

364
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:23,680
One shot,

365
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,039
and the Japanese soldiers killed him.

366
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:29,039
I kept running,

367
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,519
hid in the woods,

368
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,720
and was nearly starving,

369
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:34,519
when I met my big brother.

370
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,319
And my little sister.

371
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,599
My parents are both gone.

372
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:45,640
As their son,

373
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,359
even now,

374
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:49,039
I can't give them a proper burial.

375
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:52,880
I'm unfilial.

376
00:19:56,759 --> 00:19:57,319
Unfilial.

377
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:01,640
No matter how you look at it,

378
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,319
it all comes down to the Japanese soldiers.

379
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:05,880
They're the ones who caused this.

380
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:07,759
Yes.

381
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:10,359
It's not just me.

382
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:12,559
All the brothers in the village,

383
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,480
which one of them

384
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,799
hasn't suffered because of the Japanese soldiers?

385
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,640
Take Lao Er's family for example.

386
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:18,960
His mother...

387
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,680
Forget it, let's not talk about it.

388
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:25,079
Let's stop, no more talking.

389
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:04,599
Here, Daddy's got a piece of meat for you.

390
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:09,319
Smells good.

391
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,279
It smells so delicious.

392
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:17,640
Our Hua'er has grown taller again.

393
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:19,880
Time to make new cotton pants.

394
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,359
Great, that's wonderful.

395
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:22,680
Come on.

396
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:13,599
The day we first met,

397
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:15,039
I remember it.

398
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,319
You told me your mother had passed away.

399
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,960
Some time ago,

400
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,079
your legs weren't doing well, right?

401
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,559
I prepared this for your mother.

402
00:22:30,759 --> 00:22:31,680
I remember the date.

403
00:22:32,839 --> 00:22:33,759
Tomorrow is the seventh day after her passing.

404
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:35,039
Isn't it?

405
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:06,079
A few days ago,

406
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,599
I went out of the village to look around.

407
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:12,759
I went to the place where we ran into each other.

408
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,759
I was hoping to find something.

409
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,279
To see if I could find anything.

410
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:18,400
Maybe some clothes left by Auntie.

411
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,920
Or any of her belongings.

412
00:23:21,319 --> 00:23:22,319
But I didn’t find anything.

413
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:25,279
So I thought, this won’t do.

414
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,839
Let’s do it by the edge of the village.

415
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,920
Set up something for Auntie.

416
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,240
What I mean is,

417
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,559
So you have something to remember her by.

418
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,079
Is that okay?

419
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,519
I wanted to ask you about it.

420
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,839
I don’t even know Auntie’s name.

421
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:01,200
Right.

422
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,559
So I came to ask what Auntie’s name is.

423
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,119
Let me ask you something.

424
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:44,359
About today—

425
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,240
That Pang guy, what's his full name?

426
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,039
Pang Sihai.

427
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:49,160
What does he do?

428
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:51,599
He's the police chief of Songlin Town.

429
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:55,559
You don't think

430
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,680
he's You Shilong, do you?

431
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,480
Does he have a woman's voice?

432
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,119
I do.

433
00:25:01,319 --> 00:25:02,680
Stop overthinking it.

434
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,920
Just be honest.

435
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,640
Jin Batou and Liu Dabiao—

436
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,559
Did you do it?

437
00:25:17,079 --> 00:25:17,960
I'm telling you,

438
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,519
you'd better quit while you can.

439
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:21,920
If you dare kill You Shilong,

440
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:24,279
you won't be able to stay in Songlin Town.

441
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,519
I know.

442
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,160
You know?

443
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,400
So you never planned

444
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,000
to stay here long, right?

445
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,480
No.

446
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,279
I came here with

447
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:46,559
something important to do.

448
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:47,200
But—

449
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,519
If someone wants to die,

450
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,359
even the King of Hell can't stop them.

451
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,359
The boil finally burst.

452
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,000
It's been removed.

453
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:16,200
No more trouble from it.

454
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,240
Please, come inside.

455
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:26,839
Alright.

456
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,119
When I opened up early today,

457
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:31,000
the sunlight was so bright

458
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,480
I could barely open my eyes.

459
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:33,839
Now I get it.

460
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,640
We have an honored guest.

461
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,079
Interesting.

462
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,000
That's a real treasure.

463
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:52,799
I can tell you're an expert.

464
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,759
Good ginseng finds good people.

465
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:55,720
That's fate.

466
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,160
It's lucky, too.

467
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,599
But don't worry,

468
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:00,559
the price is negotiable.

469
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,039
Boss,

470
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,680
let me ask you something.

471
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,480
Go ahead.

472
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,799
This ginseng—

473
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,279
compared to the one

474
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,880
you saw before,

475
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:12,160
how does it measure up?

476
00:27:20,599 --> 00:27:22,079
Don't hold back.

477
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,759
Since I arrived in Songlin Town,

478
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:26,400
I've heard all sorts of things.

479
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,279
To be honest,

480
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,559
I'm here for that other one.

481
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,599
Since I've said this much,

482
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:37,000
I'll be straight with you.

483
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:38,079
Here's my honest opinion.

484
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:41,000
This ginseng is an earthly wonder.

485
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:44,359
But that one is heavenly.

486
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:48,200
You're honest.

487
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:49,640
But that ginseng

488
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,319
isn't in my hands.

489
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:54,799
Can you get it?

490
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,480
Hard to say.

491
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:56,880
Don't say "hard to say."

492
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,920
If it works out,

493
00:27:58,319 --> 00:27:59,960
you'll get your share.

494
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:01,519
Fair enough.

495
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:03,359
Of course.

496
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:06,359
May I ask where you're staying?

497
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,519
Anfu Inn.

498
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,160
Uncle.

499
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:31,720
Uncle.

500
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:34,839
You're back.

501
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:35,759
How did it go?

502
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:38,640
The ginseng shop is looking for ginseng.

503
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:43,240
They've hung up a banner.

504
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,359
Four big characters—

505
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,440
"High price for treasures."

506
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:52,960
What's wrong, Uncle?

507
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,319
It's clearly meant for us.

508
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:57,640
Why don't you go take a look?

509
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,839
Don't you think

510
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:03,319
this is a bit too smooth?

511
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:05,799
Maybe we're just lucky.

512
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,359
We've found a rich buyer.

513
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,480
Let's wait a bit longer.

514
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,359
What are we waiting for?

515
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:14,559
Miss this chance and it's gone.

516
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:14,920
Uncle.

517
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,559
I said wait, so we wait.

518
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,519
Mom

519
00:31:06,759 --> 00:31:07,480
Don't worry

520
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:11,079
I'll avenge you for sure

521
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:14,799
Hua'er, don't worry

522
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:18,599
Your enemy is my enemy

523
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,160
Auntie

524
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,680
Auntie's enemy is my enemy

525
00:31:30,279 --> 00:31:31,480
It's also my, Xiao Baima's, enemy

526
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:42,839
Mom

527
00:32:22,599 --> 00:32:24,200
Let's grab a bite together later.

528
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:25,599
No need, sis.

529
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,359
What are you looking at? Let's go.

530
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,079
Come on, let's go.

531
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,279
Hua'er

532
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:04,920
Come in.

533
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:21,000
Have a seat.

534
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:24,880
You haven't done anything wrong.

535
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:25,839
What are you afraid of?

536
00:33:29,079 --> 00:33:30,240
I'm not afraid. Why should I be?

537
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,440
Let me toast you on behalf of my mother.

538
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:56,160
Thank you for saving me.

539
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,559
Thank you for everything these days.

540
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,480
You and your brothers in the stronghold.

541
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,880
You've treated me with respect.

542
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,480
Well, um...

543
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,039
Then let me thank you too.

544
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:31,599
You saved our third chief's life.

545
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,480
Right?

546
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,800
We're all unlucky people. Let's not talk about it.

547
00:34:48,039 --> 00:34:50,559
This meal was made just for you.

548
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:51,960
Try it.

549
00:34:56,119 --> 00:34:56,840
Wait a moment.

550
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,039
Hua'er,

551
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:00,360
Stop thanking me.

552
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,599
If you keep thanking me, the food will get cold.

553
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,079
I have something important to say.

554
00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:06,559
Wait until I'm done.

555
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,760
Then decide

556
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,440
if you'll eat my food.

557
00:35:14,039 --> 00:35:15,159
A trap-laden banquet, huh?

558
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,199
Alright.

559
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:19,679
Go ahead.

560
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,800
You saved me.

561
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:30,440
You took me in.

562
00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:35,440
I want to be honest with you.

563
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,199
Actually,

564
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:43,000
I'm with the Anti-Japanese Allied Forces.

565
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,000
Before you saved me,

566
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,480
we'd just fought a tough battle.

567
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:05,719
The Japanese soldiers chased us all the way.

568
00:36:07,639 --> 00:36:08,719
I missed my mother.

569
00:36:09,079 --> 00:36:10,920
I couldn't help it, so I went to see her.

570
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:12,760
And then,

571
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,480
the Japanese soldiers spotted me.

572
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:29,199
You're not the only one in the Anti-Japanese Allied Forces.

573
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:32,719
Your father too.

574
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:37,760
Isn't that right?

575
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:45,320
Just say it—

576
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,039
You and your father, the way you act,

577
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,719
so brave,

578
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,000
if you're not bandits,

579
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:52,400
what else could you be?

580
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,000
Hua'er,

581
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:12,960
Today you've said

582
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,719
everything out loud.

583
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,920
Me, Xiao Baima,

584
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,039
I'll tell you about myself too.

585
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,639
Don't think I'm just a bandit now.

586
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,000
A few years ago,

587
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:36,000
I killed Japanese soldiers too.

588
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:37,360
And fought traitors.

589
00:37:42,039 --> 00:37:43,280
Don't look down on me.

590
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,599
Try it.

591
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,840
You made all this?

592
00:38:12,519 --> 00:38:13,400
How does it taste?

593
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:19,079
Not as good as my mother's.

594
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:23,800
It's good.

595
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:24,920
Really good.

596
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,360
Eat up.

597
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:28,079
Come on, eat.

598
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,000
Xiao Gui

599
00:39:08,199 --> 00:39:08,760
Xiao Gui

600
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,719
You finally came.

601
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,079
You had me worried sick.

602
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,639
A wealthy buyer came for ginseng.

603
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:23,639
He asked for you by name.

604
00:39:23,639 --> 00:39:24,840
He wants the one you have.

605
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:27,000
He said as long as it's good,

606
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,639
money is no problem.

607
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,800
Where is he now?

608
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,719
Don't worry, you'll get your share.

609
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,719
It's not just about the money.

610
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,360
We need to meet face to face.

611
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,679
Check the goods in person.

612
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,400
That's best for everyone.

613
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,599
When will you

614
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:46,599
bring the ginseng over?

615
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:47,480
As soon as I can.

616
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,760
You really need to hurry.

617
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,920
Don't take too long.

618
00:39:51,719 --> 00:39:53,280
The sooner we sell, the sooner we can relax.

619
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:01,840
Uncle

620
00:40:04,519 --> 00:40:05,039
Uncle

621
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:11,679
Uncle

622
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:12,400
Where did you go?

623
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:14,599
You scared me.

624
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,639
I went to the ginseng shop.

625
00:40:18,519 --> 00:40:20,280
Why didn't you tell me?

626
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:21,679
If I told you,

627
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:22,960
you wouldn't let me go.

628
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,280
But I asked around.

629
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,199
There really is a big buyer for ginseng.

630
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:29,000
Where is he from?

631
00:40:30,519 --> 00:40:31,480
I didn't ask.

632
00:40:32,679 --> 00:40:33,400
What does he do?

633
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,119
Didn't ask that either.

634
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:38,280
Even if you ask,

635
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,519
he might not tell you.

636
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,280
How come you know nothing?

637
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,199
Anyway, Boss Park said

638
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:44,400
this big buyer

639
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:46,519
doesn't care about the price if the goods are good.

640
00:40:56,599 --> 00:40:57,960
Uncle, what are you looking at?

641
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:01,159
Gui'er

642
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:03,239
Grab our stuff.

643
00:41:04,039 --> 00:41:05,119
We can't stay here.

644
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:06,760
Hurry up.

645
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:13,960
Go, go, go.

646
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:28,039
Uncle

647
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,039
You're acting scary.

648
00:41:30,679 --> 00:41:31,880
Aren't you nervous?

649
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,239
Who is that?

650
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,159
I was about to ask you.

651
00:41:52,199 --> 00:41:53,079
But he's alone.

652
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:54,280
Let's grab him.

653
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,199
Ask him and we'll know.

654
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:56,639
It's so late at night.

655
00:41:56,679 --> 00:41:57,719
He dares to come alone.

656
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:16,159
Oh my goodness.

657
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,199
So many people.

658
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,599
I just feel

659
00:42:31,239 --> 00:42:33,239
this is going too smoothly, it's suspicious.

660
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,719
Don't act alone.

661
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,119
Don't act alone.

662
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,440
I'm afraid someone will target you.

663
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,920
See, now you've got trouble.

664
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,119
Uncle

665
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:42,840
I just wanted

666
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:44,480
to get rid of this cursed thing sooner.

667
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,199
and sell it off.

668
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,320
You still have to follow orders.

669
00:42:49,239 --> 00:42:49,840
I'm telling you,

670
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:50,360
this debt

671
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:51,679
is now on your record.

672
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,039
I was wrong.

673
00:42:55,719 --> 00:42:57,000
The older, the wiser.

674
00:42:57,159 --> 00:42:57,960
Go, go.

675
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,039
This way, let's go.
