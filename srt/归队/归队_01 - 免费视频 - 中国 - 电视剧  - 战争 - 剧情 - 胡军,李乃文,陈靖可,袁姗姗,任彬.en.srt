1
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:37,240
1931

2
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,560
After the September 18th Incident

3
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:40,439
The Communist Party of China

4
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:42,279
called on the people to resist Japan

5
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:45,240
The people and army of Northeast China

6
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,639
and some patriotic soldiers

7
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:49,040
formed the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army

8
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,360
The CPC Manchuria Provincial Committee

9
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,319
organized

10
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:54,079
more than ten anti-Japanese guerrilla units

11
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,240
to fight back in the mountains and rivers of the Northeast

12
00:04:58,279 --> 00:04:59,879
In February 1936

13
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:02,240
the Northeast anti-Japanese forces

14
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,879
were unified as the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army

15
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:07,240
known as the Anti-Japanese Forces

16
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:09,920
The Anti-Japanese Forces launched

17
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,240
powerful attacks against the Japanese and their collaborators

18
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,079
The Japanese army carried out continuous

19
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,040
brutal military "suppression" campaigns

20
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,720
and enforced the "village relocation" policy

21
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,279
forcing villagers

22
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:23,319
to move into tightly controlled settlements

23
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,079
turning villages into deserted areas

24
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,240
cutting off the Anti-Japanese Forces' food supply

25
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:31,160
The struggle of the Anti-Japanese Forces

26
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,160
entered its most difficult period

27
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:53,879
Fu Qing

28
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:57,319
When was the last time you had dumplings?

29
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:00,480
We've been hungry for three days

30
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:02,600
Don't talk about food now

31
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,079
Okay?

32
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,639
Say something when you get up

33
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:07,839
You're crushing me

34
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:13,759
Squad Leader

35
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,759
Right now

36
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:18,120
we only have one flatbread left

37
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,279
What did you say?

38
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:24,240
Say it again

39
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,040
Hey, keep your voice down

40
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:28,680
We only have one baked corn cake left

41
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,439
Really

42
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,720
You...

43
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:39,360
Let me tell everyone some good news

44
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,600
What is it? What happened?

45
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:43,120
Comrade Fu Qing

46
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:45,639
was hiding another flatbread

47
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,519
What?

48
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:47,240
What?

49
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:47,800
What are you talking about?

50
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,519
Who hid it?

51
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,000
What?

52
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,720
I didn't hide it

53
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:50,199
You said it yourself

54
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:50,639
Fu Qing

55
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,360
You told me not to

56
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,000
talk to you

57
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:53,079
You asked me to keep it safe

58
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,040
Where did you put it?

59
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,720
Take it out, come on

60
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:55,839
Where is it?

61
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:56,639
Where's the food?

62
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,480
Give me the flatbread

63
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,360
Don't take it out

64
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,399
It's not in my pants

65
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,240
Where did you put it?

66
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:00,920
It's under my arm

67
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:01,399
Stop messing around

68
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:02,120
If you dare hide it in your pants

69
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:02,720
I'll get it for you

70
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,279
Take it out

71
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:04,399
I'll get it for you

72
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,560
Give it to the Squad Leader

73
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,480
What are you doing?

74
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:10,879
Just smelling it

75
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:16,160
That's enough

76
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:35,000
Share it with everyone

77
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:44,680
Gui Er

78
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,360
Thank you, Squad Leader

79
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,120
Give it to Sister Hua

80
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,360
Sister Hua works the hardest

81
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:53,759
That's right

82
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:54,879
I'm not hungry, you eat

83
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,720
You're still growing

84
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:56,879
Don't let him get any taller

85
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,839
Be a little smarter

86
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:58,920
Learn from your brother Fu Qing

87
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:00,160
He's really clever

88
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,600
He secretly hid a flatbread for himself

89
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:04,199
Tall people attract bullets

90
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:04,839
You know that?

91
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,680
Only Sister Hua

92
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:07,519
gets tired during the fight

93
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:08,439
and is still tired afterwards

94
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,079
Take it

95
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,199
Give it to the Squad Leader

96
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:32,879
Everyone, everyone

97
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:34,559
It's all shared out

98
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,600
You eat

99
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,360
I'll give

100
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,080
Let me tell everyone something

101
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:52,759
Give me a push.

102
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:53,759
Help me stand up.

103
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:58,960
These are new socks.

104
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:01,960
A few days ago,

105
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:04,200
I met an old lady.

106
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,679
She insisted on giving them to me.

107
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,559
Sixi.

108
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:08,759
Here.

109
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:11,320
You did well today.

110
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:13,240
I heard you killed five Japanese soldiers.

111
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:15,240
This

112
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,840
is your reward.

113
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,639
Thank you, Squad Leader.

114
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:19,679
I'll put them on right now.

115
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:20,639
Squad Leader.

116
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:22,159
Squad Leader.

117
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,399
Squad Leader.

118
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:24,799
Enemy spotted to the southeast.

119
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,759
How many are coming this time?

120
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:27,720
Over a hundred.

121
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:28,840
They're heading our way.

122
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,039
Gather up!

123
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,120
We

124
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:42,799
should call out our numbers again.

125
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:44,759
Leave out the numbers of the fallen.

126
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:46,519
Leave those blank.

127
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:50,639
One.

128
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:51,519
Two.

129
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:52,679
Three.

130
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:53,679
Four.

131
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:56,399
Six.

132
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,480
Nine.

133
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,559
Ten.

134
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:02,440
Eleven.

135
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,080
Twelve, thirteen, fourteen.

136
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:05,759
Fifteen, sixteen, seventeen.

137
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:06,600
Eighteen.

138
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:11,080
We're surrounded by the enemy.

139
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,639
If anyone makes it out alive,

140
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:16,360
remember this.

141
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,159
Head straight to Mudanjiang.

142
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,639
Songlin Town.

143
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,759
Go to the eight tall pines north of town.

144
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:23,879
There,

145
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:25,279
find

146
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:26,320
the thickest

147
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,840
and tallest pine tree.

148
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:30,919
Carve your number into it.

149
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,200
Let me repeat.

150
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,879
If you break through,

151
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,480
go straight to Songlin Town.

152
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,080
Then,

153
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,279
in Songlin Town,

154
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,639
hide yourself well.

155
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:46,480
Wait to regroup.

156
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,480
Stay alive.

157
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,159
Fight to survive.

158
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:52,080
As long as you're alive, there's hope.

159
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:54,000
We must fight them to the end.

160
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,799
No matter how long this war lasts,

161
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,559
victory will be ours.

162
00:10:59,039 --> 00:10:59,600
Squad Leader.

163
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:00,720
The Japanese are coming!

164
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:07,960
Get ready to fight!

165
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,159
Fire!

166
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,240
Er Chou

167
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:19,320
Fire the cannon!

168
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,639
Get down!

169
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:34,399
What happened to your mouth?

170
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,200
It's nothing.

171
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:45,360
Come on.

172
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,279
Go!

173
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,120
Squad Leader Two, over here.

174
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,840
Our blood runs hot with passion

175
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,840
and if it must be spilled,

176
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,320
let it be on these mountains and rivers.

177
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,519
As long as I, Old Shandong,

178
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:43,519
have a breath left in me,

179
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,240
I'll lead everyone back to the unit.

180
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:26,919
Sixi

181
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,279
You did well today.

182
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:34,039
This

183
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:35,679
is your reward.

184
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:37,399
Thank you, Squad Leader.

185
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,519
Big Ears

186
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,000
Big Ears

187
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:23,840
Big Ears

188
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:05,920
Xiao Gui

189
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:08,160
Xiao Gui

190
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:16,680
Gui'er

191
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:21,759
Gui'er

192
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,039
Gui'er

193
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,039
Gui'er

194
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:26,680
Stop

195
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,759
Even the King of Hell must follow the rules

196
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,039
Don't hit the face

197
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:33,200
Wake up

198
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,279
Wake up

199
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:44,839
Don't worry

200
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:46,440
Me?

201
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,039
I'll get one for you

202
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,400
A real sniper rifle

203
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:53,039
Alright

204
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:54,839
Squad Leader, I trust you

205
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:56,960
You're a veteran Party member

206
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,240
You wouldn't lie to me

207
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:04,759
Let me do it

208
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:28,240
Squad Leader

209
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:31,279
Tell me

210
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:35,519
Sister Hua, Brother Fuqing, and the others

211
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,759
Are they still alive?

212
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:49,640
Then it's just us left

213
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:53,319
Why are you crying?

214
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,160
That's bad luck

215
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,920
The gates of hell here

216
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:00,039
Aren't so easy to enter

217
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,920
They're definitely still alive

218
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:13,920
Let's go

219
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,880
Keep searching

220
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,359
Hurry

221
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:17,079
Move quickly

222
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,519
Wait, wait

223
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:38,720
Second Squad Leader

224
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,640
Rest here for a bit

225
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:41,759
Where are you going?

226
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,759
To find herbs for you

227
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:43,960
My leg doesn't need medicine

228
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,039
Can't even get out of the woods

229
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:46,440
Be careful

230
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,200
Squad Leader

231
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:08,079
I can't walk anymore

232
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:15,480
Sit here and rest

233
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,039
Squad Leader

234
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,200
Why do we have to go to Songlin Town?

235
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,599
Over there

236
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:41,799
There's a contact point for us

237
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,519
As long as we find the shop owner

238
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,000
He can take us into the mountains

239
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,000
To find the main force

240
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:49,359
When that time comes

241
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:51,680
We can start fighting again

242
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,160
Begin anew

243
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,680
How far is that?

244
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,079
Us

245
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:02,039
Rest when we're tired

246
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,079
Go when we're rested

247
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:06,559
We'll get there sooner or later

248
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,319
Over there, chase them!

249
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,160
Go after them!

250
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,480
They're over there!

251
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,480
Keep chasing!

252
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:20,480
Up there! Hurry over!

253
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,039
Shoot!

254
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,519
Let's go.

255
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,640
Search over there.

256
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:46,119
Yes.

257
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,519
Keep searching.

258
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,319
I've made up the numbers this time.

259
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,880
Settle last time's flatbread money quickly.

260
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:38,880
Otherwise,

261
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,039
Boss You will get angry.

262
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,880
Who are you people?

263
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,279
Gold miners.

264
00:23:53,079 --> 00:23:53,799
We're here for gold.

265
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,480
You know a thing or two.

266
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:00,680
What do you two do?

267
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:02,400
This is my knife.

268
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,680
I'm a butcher.

269
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:06,079
A butcher?

270
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:09,319
As long as you don't kill people.

271
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,240
Stop glaring at me.

272
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:16,759
Staring won't help you.

273
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:18,720
Let me be honest with you.

274
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,000
Now that you're here,

275
00:24:21,079 --> 00:24:22,880
you've reached the lucky spot.

276
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,519
In this water,

277
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,480
on this shore,

278
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,240
you can grab handfuls of gold sand.

279
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,279
Stop talking nonsense.

280
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,599
Let a little girl

281
00:24:32,599 --> 00:24:33,559
trick us onto the road.

282
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,440
With such dirty tricks,

283
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,519
you're clearly no good.

284
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:40,599
Fu Qing.

285
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:41,839
Are you okay?

286
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,000
Let me warn you,

287
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:46,319
A few guys tried to escape days ago.

288
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,319
We made a big fuss.

289
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:48,839
None of them got away.

290
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:50,000
They kept their lives,

291
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,839
but lost

292
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,000
a few body parts.

293
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:53,920
So?

294
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:55,400
Have you decided?

295
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,680
To hell with your decision.

296
00:24:57,119 --> 00:24:58,119
Let us go!

297
00:24:58,119 --> 00:24:58,640
Stop!

298
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,440
Let us leave!

299
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,680
What are you waiting for?

300
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,279
If you can get by in these times,

301
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:03,039
that's better than anything.

302
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,599
We'll do it.

303
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,079
We'll do it.

304
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,160
Yun Hu, Yun Hu...

305
00:25:22,759 --> 00:25:23,839
No offense,

306
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:25,519
but you just had to eat that flatbread.

307
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:27,599
See what happened now?

308
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,960
You sure talk nonsense.

309
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,319
Who wanted to eat it anyway?

310
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:36,480
Hey, friend.

311
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,079
Hey, friend.

312
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,039
Take it.

313
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:47,160
My dad

314
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:48,440
told me to give this to you.

315
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:49,920
Take it.

316
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:08,519
I'll eat the flatbread first.

317
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,039
If I'm fine, you eat next.

318
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:16,920
I'll eat first.

319
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,039
If I'm fine, you eat after.

320
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,000
I really can't figure you out.

321
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,960
I'm just worried there's something wrong with it.

322
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:26,880
If you'd listened to me,

323
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:28,759
we wouldn't have fallen for their trick.

324
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:32,119
So what do we do now?

325
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,400
We still have to go to Songlin Town.

326
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,799
What should we do?

327
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,519
Let's run.

328
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:40,200
Don't rush.

329
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:41,720
Let's check the situation first.

330
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,599
Mom.

331
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:06,720
Mom.

332
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,519
Mom.

333
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,759
There's no rice left to cook today.

334
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:01,359
What I'm afraid of is

335
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:06,519
our whole family, young and old,

336
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,200
might not survive till tomorrow.

337
00:28:09,319 --> 00:28:10,039
I lean on the door.

338
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:10,680
Yunhu.

339
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:12,039
Did you hear that?

340
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:13,079
Someone's singing opera.

341
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,640
It actually sounds pretty good.

342
00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:18,880
It's kind of eerie.

343
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:21,759
It's fine, nothing to do with us.

344
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,519
Why are you here?

345
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,039
This month,

346
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,799
these meat cakes

347
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:35,960
aren't done yet?

348
00:28:36,359 --> 00:28:38,000
If I didn't come myself,

349
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,759
who knows how long you'd drag it out.

350
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,039
Sorry to trouble you.

351
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,839
They're almost ready.

352
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:47,759
I was just about to report to you.

353
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,880
Don't slack off.

354
00:28:54,119 --> 00:28:55,440
If you do, no dinner tonight.

355
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,559
There's a cave-in! A cave-in!

356
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:01,119
Go check it out.

357
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:07,160
My poor child...

358
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:14,279
Ever since you went to Manchuria,

359
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:18,200
chasing gold,

360
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:23,039
your parents' tears

361
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,559
have flowed like a river.

362
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:32,599
The pain in our hearts

363
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:36,200
has left deep marks.

364
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:39,240
We wait every day,

365
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,680
every month.

366
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,759
You left without a word.

367
00:29:45,799 --> 00:29:48,079
My child...

368
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:50,079
That's really something.

369
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:51,920
All this crying and wiping tears,

370
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,319
wailing and howling,

371
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:55,079
like they've lost a loved one.

372
00:29:55,079 --> 00:29:55,839
It's just the same.

373
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,079
Boss.

374
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,599
You know it's not easy for me either.

375
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:03,480
Give me a little more if you can.

376
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,279
The road home crosses mountains and hills.

377
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,519
Wading through rivers.

378
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:08,440
This drama is really something.

379
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:09,960
At first I thought

380
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,359
the gold camp boss could control him.

381
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,799
But seeing this,

382
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:15,960
that's not the case.

383
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,960
From the looks of it,

384
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,720
he's not afraid of the boss either.

385
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:22,960
We've cried and wailed enough.

386
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:26,160
Let's get going.

387
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,200
Fuqing.

388
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,559
Fuqing, Fuqing!

389
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,680
What's wrong, Fuqing?

390
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:31,440
Fuqing.

391
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:36,799
Want some water?

392
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,680
You're hurt, why didn't you say anything?

393
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,559
What's the point in saying it?

394
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,680
I thought I'd just tough it out.

395
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,240
Didn't expect to get a fever too.

396
00:30:55,079 --> 00:30:56,359
Here, eat something.

397
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,680
Yunhu.

398
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:02,200
If I really can't make it this time,

399
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:06,440
you have to escape no matter what.

400
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,039
Go to Songlin Town in Mudanjiang.

401
00:31:12,759 --> 00:31:13,920
Find the eight pine trees.

402
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,759
Carve my name on them.

403
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:19,680
Even if I die,

404
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,839
I'll still be counted as returned to the ranks.

405
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,480
What, you got no hands?

406
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:26,039
If you've got guts,

407
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:27,640
heal up and carve it yourself.

408
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,880
No one's going to do it for you.

409
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,279
Hurry up and eat.

410
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,400
Mr. Feng

411
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:06,000
Mr. Feng

412
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:11,400
Who are you?

413
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:12,920
It's me, Hua.

414
00:35:13,239 --> 00:35:14,039
Mr. Feng

415
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,639
Oh my goodness!

416
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:23,119
Is that really Hua?

417
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:25,000
What happened to you?

418
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:26,639
I barely recognize you.

419
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,559
All these years,

420
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:29,559
where have you been?

421
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,119
Mr. Feng

422
00:35:32,199 --> 00:35:33,119
Where's my mother?

423
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,360
She's here with us.

424
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,480
Don't worry.

425
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:42,199
Alright.

426
00:35:42,679 --> 00:35:44,880
Please help take care of my mother.

427
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:46,840
Mr. Feng

428
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:48,079
You take care too.

429
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,079
Old Brother Feng is back!

430
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,239
Don't rush.

431
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,239
It'll be fine soon.

432
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,440
No hurry, no hurry.

433
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,840
Hua's mother.

434
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,440
I...

435
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,199
Let me tell you something.

436
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:36,119
I have something to say.

437
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:38,079
What is it?

438
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:44,440
Body search.

439
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:50,320
I just ran into Hua on the back hill.

440
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,199
Go quickly.

441
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,880
Maybe you can see her one more time.

442
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:55,960
Proof.

443
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,639
Where are you going?

444
00:36:59,239 --> 00:37:00,480
To gather some firewood.

445
00:37:01,639 --> 00:37:02,360
Why is your leg hurt?

446
00:37:03,159 --> 00:37:04,599
I twisted it by accident.

447
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,559
Take off your shoes.

448
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:14,440
Go on, go on, go on.

449
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,119
Come back soon!

450
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:16,880
Okay.

451
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,159
Hua'er

452
00:37:30,679 --> 00:37:31,400
Hua'er

453
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:33,320
Hua'er

454
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,360
Mother

455
00:37:36,199 --> 00:37:36,800
Mother

456
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:38,079
I'm here

457
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:38,719
Hua'er

458
00:37:39,079 --> 00:37:39,880
Hua'er

459
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,639
Hua'er

460
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,599
Mother, why are you here?

461
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:44,320
Hua'er

462
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,079
Mother

463
00:37:45,559 --> 00:37:46,519
What happened to your leg?

464
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:47,559
I'm fine

465
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,440
Where did you come from?

466
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:50,119
Mother

467
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,079
Come with me

468
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:55,320
Taikun

469
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:56,159
Tonight

470
00:37:56,679 --> 00:37:57,519
I'll stew a chicken for you

471
00:37:57,639 --> 00:37:59,000
It's really nourishing, I'm telling you

472
00:37:59,159 --> 00:37:59,719
Really

473
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,559
Please sit

474
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:05,719
Child

475
00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:07,480
We have no home now

476
00:38:08,679 --> 00:38:09,800
No home left

477
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:11,559
The Japanese

478
00:38:12,199 --> 00:38:14,000
They're enforcing the baojia system

479
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:16,199
One person makes a mistake

480
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,840
Ten families suffer

481
00:38:19,239 --> 00:38:20,440
Old Grandpa Feng

482
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,679
He made a tough decision

483
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:25,599
That's why he told them you were here

484
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:28,719
Come

485
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:30,039
Girl

486
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,039
That Japanese soldier

487
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:34,960
He won't let us take food out

488
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,519
They're searching everywhere

489
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:38,800
Mother made these flatbreads for you

490
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,239
Don't mind if they're not perfect

491
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:44,280
Mother really has no other way

492
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,239
Good child

493
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:50,800
The Japanese are patrolling here

494
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,719
You have to leave right now

495
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,519
As long as you survive

496
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,760
Mother still has hope to live

497
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,159
Go quickly

498
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:01,760
Taikun, you'll know after you eat

499
00:39:03,159 --> 00:39:03,719
Taikun

500
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:05,360
There's someone over there

501
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:06,800
What are you doing?

502
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:09,679
Don't get up

503
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:12,960
Sir

504
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:14,000
It's nothing

505
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:15,400
Just gathering firewood

506
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:17,039
Why gather firewood here?

507
00:39:17,239 --> 00:39:17,880
Who's behind you?

508
00:39:18,199 --> 00:39:19,000
Sneaking around

509
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:19,639
Stand up

510
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:21,639
No one

511
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,599
No one

512
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:23,920
Go quickly

513
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:24,360
I'm leaving

514
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,440
They won't let you go

515
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,960
If you don't leave now, it'll be too late

516
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,400
Don't move

517
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,519
You look unfamiliar

518
00:39:45,159 --> 00:39:45,920
Which group are you from?

519
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:46,960
Show your papers

520
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:49,960
Pretending not to hear me, huh?

521
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,639
Mother

522
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:10,880
Mother

523
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:13,519
Mother

524
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:14,599
What's wrong?

525
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:15,880
Reporting to Taikun

526
00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:17,239
There's an Anti-Japanese fighter over there

527
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:18,320
Go after them
