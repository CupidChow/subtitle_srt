1
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,560
Father-in-law

2
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,200
So, just the two of us

3
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:45,760
let's have a chat

4
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:46,439
let's talk

5
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,239
Where are you from?

6
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:48,959
Lanjia Village

7
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:49,560
What's your trade?

8
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,439
Digging and planting crops

9
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,079
What brings you here?

10
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:51,719
Looking for my daughter

11
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:52,280
What's your daughter's name?

12
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,439
Her surname is Lan, her name is Hua

13
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:54,920
Lan Hua

14
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,599
She smells nice

15
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,920
Why did she come to Congshan Mountain?

16
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,560
She has distant relatives here

17
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:02,719
That's a lie

18
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:09,759
That Lanjia Village

19
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:12,039
was wiped out by the Japanese long ago

20
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,120
The people there

21
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,680
were all

22
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,319
thrown into cages

23
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:18,759
Yes

24
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,800
You're right

25
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:24,240
From the very start

26
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,199
I made sure Hua escaped

27
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,960
So now I'm

28
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,039
searching everywhere for her

29
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:31,639
By accident

30
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,960
I ended up in this mess

31
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,759
Luckily, I met the ginseng gang

32
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:37,159
As for what happened next

33
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,639
you already know everything

34
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:40,479
Well

35
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:41,879
And then

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,120
I followed

37
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,000
your horse's hoofprints

38
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:47,080
and reached the bandit camp gate

39
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,039
I waited here

40
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:51,360
but after all that waiting

41
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:53,560
you brought my daughter in

42
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,039
Wait, that's not right

43
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,800
You waited at my doorstep

44
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,639
What were you planning?

45
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,400
How many lives did that ginseng cost?

46
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:18,960
You know that too

47
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,039
And you just took it away

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,439
I'm not happy about it

49
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,000
But I never expected

50
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:29,840
my daughter would end up in your hands

51
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:31,439
So I gave up that idea

52
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,120
You're a reasonable man

53
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:36,879
Wait, that's not right

54
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:38,199
Isn't there someone else?

55
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:40,479
That's my nephew

56
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,280
I didn't let him come

57
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,840
If something happens to me here

58
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,159
if anything goes wrong

59
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,759
my family needs someone left behind

60
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,879
Your reputation

61
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,159
I've heard of it before

62
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,479
Around these parts

63
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,039
they talk about you, I

64
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:01,039
Let's not talk about local gossip

65
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,080
Don't play games with me

66
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,520
Wait, so this conversation

67
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:05,520
how do we continue?

68
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,000
I heard from Lao Er

69
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,840
you've got some skills

70
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,639
What skills?

71
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,479
Show us

72
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,560
Let my brothers see for themselves

73
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,920
If your skills

74
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,000
impress my brothers

75
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,879
and they're satisfied

76
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,160
then we'll keep talking

77
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,959
but if they're not

78
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,759
White Horse

79
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:05,199
A man of honor

80
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,720
He robs the rich

81
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:08,319
But never hurts anyone

82
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:10,120
He eats the best meat

83
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:12,680
And gives the bones to the people

84
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,959
You've got true grit with nowhere to show it

85
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:18,160
He rules the mountain

86
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:20,160
Living free and easy

87
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,240
But in the past

88
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,000
When the volunteers fought the Japanese

89
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,040
You led the way with two guns

90
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:32,120
Fired the first shot

91
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:34,279
Good

92
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:37,360
With a roar to reclaim our land

93
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,000
Many shed tears hearing it

94
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,319
Tears streaming down

95
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,399
With a bang, you fired

96
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:46,839
Killed the Japanese officer on the white horse

97
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:49,160
So many Japanese soldiers were terrified

98
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,439
Crying and howling

99
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,439
Calling for their fathers and mothers

100
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,800
Since then, Congshan Mountain had White Horse

101
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,360
His name spread everywhere

102
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,439
Famed far and wide

103
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:00,600
Good

104
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:01,920
Good

105
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,360
Good

106
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:05,920
Good

107
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,680
Me, your father-in-law

108
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:09,360
Where did you learn that?

109
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,240
Such skill

110
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,639
Didn't you ask me to show my talent?

111
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:14,759
This is all I've got

112
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:16,519
It's mainly you

113
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,600
You did great things in the past

114
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,079
That's all in the past

115
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:22,759
Let's not talk about the past

116
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,000
Now the Japanese are enforcing the forced relocation policy

117
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,160
The forest has become a no-man's land

118
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,279
Now I just

119
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,680
Lead my brothers

120
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,519
Sitting on the mountain, holding a ladle

121
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:37,439
I can eat a spoonful

122
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,199
I eat a spoonful

123
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:42,240
Is that a bit like what he meant?

124
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,079
Hearing this

125
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:48,439
You, Brother White Horse

126
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,639
Are a reasonable man

127
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:52,879
Can you let me

128
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:54,639
Take my daughter away?

129
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,360
No

130
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:03,879
Then

131
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:05,160
Can you at least let me

132
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,800
See my daughter first?

133
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,879
That's fine

134
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:12,519
For the skill you just showed me

135
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,519
I have to give you respect

136
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:23,759
Girl

137
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,519
Dad finally found you

138
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,000
Dad

139
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:35,079
I thought I'd never see you again

140
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,079
Dad

141
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:37,480
Alright, alright

142
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:39,199
You two have a good talk

143
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,680
What happened to your foot?

144
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,240
Just a minor injury

145
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:46,920
Let me see

146
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:47,560
Come here

147
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:48,720
Come here

148
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:55,160
I got shot.

149
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,160
It's nothing.

150
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,639
Just a scratch.

151
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,040
Squad.

152
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,399
Dad.

153
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:09,399
Why are you here?

154
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,040
It's a long story.

155
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,600
Big brother.

156
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:20,079
How are you?

157
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,360
Are you new or familiar?

158
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,480
Couldn't be more familiar.

159
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,360
Totally familiar.

160
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,360
As soon as we met, tears came.

161
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,000
They just kept falling.

162
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:29,600
Streaming down in a row.

163
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,519
That's good.

164
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:33,519
Familiar is good.

165
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,080
This whole pot is cooked through.

166
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:39,759
Brother, don't tell me you...

167
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:41,279
Really caught feelings?

168
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,240
Get outta here!

169
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,200
That sister-in-law sure has a fiery temper.

170
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,759
Sister-in-law.

171
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:52,200
This woman really is something.

172
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:52,720
Makes me...

173
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,919
Why am I telling you two this?

174
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,120
Just chatting.

175
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:02,759
Chat about what?

176
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:04,960
Squad leader risked himself to save me.

177
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,080
He lured the Japanese away.

178
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,879
He jumped off a cliff.

179
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,720
As for Deyuan,

180
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,559
He's lucky, blessed, and resourceful.

181
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:23,759
Always full of tricks, he...

182
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,679
He should be fine.

183
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,399
Did you go to Bakesong?

184
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:31,399
Who else is still alive?

185
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,799
Xiaogui is with me.

186
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,240
We were hiding from the Japanese too.

187
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,159
So we went into the woods.

188
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,519
Barely made it out.

189
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:41,759
Then we ran into White Horse.

190
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,559
He brought you up here, right?

191
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,000
So I followed.

192
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,120
Bakesong...

193
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,200
I haven't been there yet.

194
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,639
It's all my fault.

195
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,080
I got my mother killed.

196
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,000
What happened?

197
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:02,080
I missed my mom.

198
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,000
I snuck home to see her.

199
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,120
She came out

200
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,320
to bring me food.

201
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,159
The Japanese spotted her.

202
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,679
They killed her.

203
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:25,519
The Japanese kept chasing me.

204
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:28,200
White Horse heard the gunshots.

205
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,000
He killed the Japanese.

206
00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:31,679
And saved me.

207
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,639
Another blood debt added.

208
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:40,639
Don't worry, girl.

209
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:42,639
I'll lead you all

210
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:44,240
to settle every score.

211
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,039
I'll go to Bakesong with you.

212
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,200
Your leg is still hurt.

213
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,279
I'm fine.

214
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,519
It's just a minor wound.

215
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,240
I can go even with a limp.

216
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,480
Let's hurry and gather the team.

217
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,120
Get everyone together.

218
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:58,000
Listen to me, girl.

219
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,279
Out there now,

220
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:01,679
the Japanese,

221
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:02,879
the puppet troops,

222
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:04,480
all have dogs.

223
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:05,799
They're searching the woods every day.

224
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:07,159
Can you outrun them?

225
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:14,000
Here.

226
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,279
The people in the village

227
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,440
haven't treated you badly, have they?

228
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:18,720
No, they haven't.

229
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:20,399
Alright.

230
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,039
I'll go talk to White Horse

231
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:23,879
and see what's going on.

232
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:26,159
If this place is

233
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:28,159
a den of danger,

234
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,919
I'll risk my life to get you out.

235
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:33,679
If they mean no harm,

236
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:36,639
stay here in the mountains

237
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:38,159
and recover from your injuries.

238
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:39,720
In ten days or so,

239
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:41,759
I'll come back for you.

240
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,600
How does that sound?

241
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,399
Then I'll wait for you.

242
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:46,879
When you go to Bakesong,

243
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,120
be sure to carve my mark there.

244
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:53,960
Commander.

245
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:56,200
Everyone, move quickly!

246
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,080
We need to get back before dark.

247
00:11:58,799 --> 00:11:59,360
Alright then.

248
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,919
Unload these two trucks up front.

249
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,600
Take those four barrels of water in the back

250
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:05,480
to Major's quarters.

251
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:11,679
Yes.

252
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:18,159
You group here

253
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:19,840
handle these two vehicles.

254
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:21,120
The rest of you

255
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,519
take care of the other two in the back.

256
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,360
Get moving, hurry up!

257
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:26,039
Quick!

258
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:26,559
Move!

259
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:27,039
Faster, faster!

260
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:29,919
Hurry!

261
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:31,759
Go!

262
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:34,000
What are you doing? Move it!

263
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,000
Sorry, sorry.

264
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,919
That Katayama guy

265
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,519
has been pretty quiet lately.

266
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:05,120
He's had diarrhea every day.

267
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,200
Looks exhausted.

268
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:09,399
It's that moldy bread.

269
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:10,519
We always

270
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:11,639
eat half and toss the rest.

271
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,159
But not him.

272
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,120
He eats anything.

273
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,960
Finishes a whole one every meal.

274
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,480
No wonder he's got the runs.

275
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:20,039
Eating that stuff

276
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:20,840
is worse than

277
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:22,120
the wild greens we dig up.

278
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,240
If he keeps eating like this,

279
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,120
he won't starve,

280
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,240
he'll poison himself.

281
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:33,039
I noticed that Korean guy

282
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,039
always hangs out with his people

283
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:36,480
in a group.

284
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:38,120
They don't let anyone else near.

285
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,039
Tell me,

286
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:41,840
are they

287
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,480
planning an escape?

288
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:46,879
Could be.

289
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,360
Who wouldn't want to run?

290
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:54,240
This forced labor camp

291
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:54,960
I've observed it.

292
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,000
It's not complicated.

293
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,240
But escaping is tough.

294
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,639
When I was in other camps,

295
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:17,799
every so often

296
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:19,000
I'd see

297
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:20,399
trucks hauling gasoline barrels

298
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,200
and explosives

299
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,000
up into the mountains.

300
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:25,840
Do you think nearby

301
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:27,480
there's a fuel depot?

302
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:28,879
A fuel depot?

303
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:30,919
Where would that be?

304
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,159
Are you even listening to me?

305
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:37,879
If you don't hurry, we'll run out of time.

306
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:39,039
Do you understand?

307
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:42,840
Get lost.

308
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,399
Yes.

309
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:49,159
Commander Xiao

310
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,000
Jap officer

311
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,919
This road is really bumpy.

312
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,639
I've kept it close to my chest.

313
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,320
It's still warm.

314
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,799
Very good.

315
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:05,440
Jap officer

316
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:08,360
It's hard to bathe in these deep forests.

317
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,879
For Major Fujimoto and you,

318
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:12,440
I've prepared bath water.

319
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,519
Use as much as you like.

320
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,679
Commander Xiao

321
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,480
You've gone to a lot of trouble.

322
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,480
No trouble at all.

323
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:22,120
The Imperial Japanese Army

324
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,399
values hygiene,

325
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:25,159
loves cleanliness and bathing.

326
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,000
They're our role models.

327
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:27,759
Our example to follow.

328
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,759
I make my men

329
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:30,720
bathe every day.

330
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,080
They scrub themselves clean.

331
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,879
Their skin's almost rubbed raw.

332
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,639
Rubbed raw.

333
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,159
Raw.

334
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,519
Very good.

335
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:43,759
Very good, very good.

336
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:47,559
Honestly, now they

337
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:48,679
have no lice on them.

338
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,039
Not even on their heads.

339
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:51,759
Commander Xiao

340
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,240
If you need help,

341
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,519
given our relationship,

342
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:55,799
just say it straight.

343
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,159
Could you, when the time is right,

344
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,240
put in a good word for me

345
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:04,200
in front of Major Fujimoto?

346
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,120
You know how it is.

347
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:12,759
The construction underway

348
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:14,440
is all military secrets.

349
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,799
Letting you transport supplies

350
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,960
is already a big show of trust.

351
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:21,559
It's hard to get a different job.

352
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,600
Don't make trouble.

353
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:25,080
Yes, yes, of course.

354
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,279
I know it's hard.

355
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:29,000
If it wasn't, could I ask you to come out of retirement?

356
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:33,840
If you need anything else,

357
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,679
just let me know.

358
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,000
By the way,

359
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,519
the Autumn Festival is coming soon.

360
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,159
We'll need

361
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,600
a lot of preparations.

362
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,320
Commander Xiao

363
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,879
You got it.

364
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:50,320
Understood.

365
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,320
Understood.

366
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,240
Very good.

367
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,320
Get up and get to work!

368
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,279
Hurry up and work!

369
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,720
Stop looking around.

370
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:01,919
How about this—

371
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:03,320
I'll bring the water over to you.

372
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:04,839
Please.

373
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:05,920
Goodbye.

374
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:35,519
Father-in-law

375
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:38,559
What's wrong?

376
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,079
Are your eyes squinting,

377
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,759
or are you holding back tears?

378
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:42,759
You tell me.

379
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:44,319
If you ask me,

380
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,119
it's because you saw your daughter.

381
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:46,920
You're happy, right?

382
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,119
Father-in-law

383
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:52,079
Sit down.

384
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:57,039
Stop calling me father-in-law every time.

385
00:17:57,799 --> 00:17:58,839
It sounds awkward.

386
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:07,119
Then let's talk under the sun.

387
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:09,839
Your daughter—

388
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,079
I've taken a liking to her.

389
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,039
So what if you have?

390
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,480
My daughter

391
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:20,440
has plenty of admirers.

392
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:21,960
Let me tell you,

393
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,039
she's had a fiery temper since she was little.

394
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:26,400
If you ever lay a hand on her,

395
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:27,960
or anything bad happens,

396
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:30,200
you people

397
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,319
and us

398
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,720
will have a real feud.

399
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,200
You folks

400
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,240
Us

401
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,920
Who are you, really?

402
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,559
I'm from the land of white mountains and black waters.

403
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:51,640
Who are you trying to scare?

404
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,799
You came up the mountain, huh?

405
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,279
Which band are you with?

406
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,119
Don't move.

407
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,279
Second Brother

408
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,920
Put down the gun.

409
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:24,839
Put it down.

410
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:33,680
You really do have some skills.

411
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,480
Let me put it this way.

412
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,960
I may be a bandit,

413
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,799
but we have our seven rules of conduct.

414
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:49,960
We don't rob or steal without reason.

415
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,920
That's the rule of Congshan Mountain.

416
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,440
The name White Horse of Congshan,

417
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,160
around these parts,

418
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:01,880
is well-known and respected.

419
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,680
Don't look down on me.

420
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:08,720
If I fancy a woman,

421
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:11,000
and she likes me too,

422
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:13,759
I'll treat her well for life.

423
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:16,519
But if she doesn't choose me,

424
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,599
I won't force her.

425
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:22,319
You said it yourself.

426
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,599
Father-in-law,

427
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,640
A word given

428
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:27,079
is as good as a nail.

429
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,680
My daughter told me

430
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,079
that in the woods,

431
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:43,119
you killed a Jap and saved her.

432
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:45,359
Here and now,

433
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:47,039
I thank you.

434
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:49,079
Anyone who bullies our women

435
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,440
must be killed.

436
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,920
My daughter is injured now.

437
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,960
Her leg isn't working well.

438
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,400
Can she stay at your stronghold

439
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,039
to recover for a few days?

440
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:03,559
She can.

441
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:05,519
After a while,

442
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,799
I'll come to pick her up.

443
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:09,240
She must be healthy and whole.

444
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,480
Alright.

445
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:12,119
I promise you.

446
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,680
But let me say this first.

447
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:15,000
Just to be clear,

448
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,960
if your daughter

449
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,480
doesn't want to leave with you,

450
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,960
then it's up to me,

451
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,720
White Horse, to handle it.

452
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:24,359
My daughter

453
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,640
makes her own decisions.

454
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,119
She decides for herself.

455
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:27,759
Alright.

456
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,400
Wait a moment.

457
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,599
What does that mean?

458
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:53,920
A son-in-law's gift to his father-in-law,

459
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,720
a ladder—it's a greeting gift.

460
00:21:57,319 --> 00:21:58,359
You're a man of tradition.

461
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,000
Father-in-law,

462
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,440
you're no ordinary man.

463
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:07,359
You know our lingo.

464
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:08,680
You're sharp.

465
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:11,759
You know a bit, but not everything.

466
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,559
I'm the mountain chief,

467
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,400
so I know a thing or two.

468
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:47,240
Stop dawdling.

469
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:48,759
Don't hit me.

470
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:49,400
Get up, quick.

471
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,400
Don't hit me.

472
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,119
Are you looking to die?

473
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,880
Don't hit me.

474
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:01,880
Sir,

475
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,880
Stop hitting him.

476
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,160
We're already short on people.

477
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,759
If someone gets hurt,

478
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,119
we'll lose another worker.

479
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,880
Winter is coming soon.

480
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,960
As long as the project gets done.

481
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:16,759
Listen up,

482
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,279
if you don't finish today's work,

483
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,599
no one gets to eat.

484
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:28,319
Get to work.

485
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,119
Everyone, hurry up!

486
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:31,799
Move faster.

487
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,880
Come on, hurry.

488
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,839
Take it easy, be careful.

489
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:34,960
Hurry up, hurry up.

490
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,480
Slow down, slow down.

491
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:36,799
Let’s go, let’s go.

492
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:37,400
Erchengzi.

493
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:38,599
Come here.

494
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,559
Come on, come on.

495
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,160
This autumn, we need to fatten up more.

496
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,440
How old is this one?

497
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,400
It’s not even as tall as a scallion.

498
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:48,200
Looks just like a chick.

499
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,480
No, it’s the same when drinking.

500
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:50,559
That’s not manly at all.

501
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,440
You’re the one not as tall as a scallion.

502
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,839
I’ll kick you to death.

503
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:53,680
Third Brother.

504
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:54,880
Let me tell you.

505
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,559
My mom makes those radish strips.

506
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,039
With chili and millet porridge.

507
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,160
I can eat several bowls.

508
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:02,799
It’s so tasty, I get lost in it.

509
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,000
You shirtless guys.

510
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,359
Pull your shirts up.

511
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:14,359
There’s one more thing.

512
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,920
When working.

513
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,160
Don’t shout and yell.

514
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:18,079
Keep your voices down.

515
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,319
You’re the loudest.

516
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:20,599
Like a braying donkey.

517
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,519
Damn it.

518
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:25,319
They don’t want it.

519
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,000
The chief’s intentions.

520
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,200
All wasted.

521
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,960
You didn’t see it.

522
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,839
Those hands and legs.

523
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:32,960
Were cut up by those foreign blades.

524
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,920
Covered in blood.

525
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,279
What?

526
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:37,599
What are you doing?

527
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:38,799
The girl insisted on it.

528
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,359
If you like it, keep it for yourself.

529
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,279
No.

530
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,480
I mean,

531
00:24:42,759 --> 00:24:44,519
the chief’s good intentions.

532
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:46,640
He climbed the tree himself.

533
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:47,759
Got those wooden strips.

534
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,000
With his clumsy hands.

535
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:50,119
Those little floral cloth strips.

536
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:51,119
Wrapped them four or five times.

537
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:51,839
Only then was he satisfied.

538
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,640
Why?

539
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,839
Because our chief,

540
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:55,440
Well,

541
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,400
he’s still the leader of the bandits.

542
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,599
When has he ever for a woman

543
00:24:58,599 --> 00:24:59,519
put his heart and soul into something?

544
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:01,799
So you’re the only one who understands?

545
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:02,799
You know everything?

546
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,400
Aren’t you also nervous about it?

547
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,640
Scratching your head and ears?

548
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,279
No, Second Brother.

549
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:08,799
You’re pushing your luck.

550
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:09,279
Right?

551
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:10,119
So what if I am?

552
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:10,960
No, you tell me.

553
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,680
You’re pushing it.

554
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,160
So what?

555
00:25:12,599 --> 00:25:13,359
Go ahead, push.

556
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:14,480
So what?

557
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,279
So what?

558
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:18,799
Keep it down.

559
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:20,960
No.

560
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:22,880
When did you take it?

561
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:23,799
When did you bring it back?

562
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:25,640
Damn it.

563
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,680
Damn it.

564
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:28,599
Isn’t it done?

565
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:30,319
Damn it.

566
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,079
Go, go, go.

567
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:31,839
Keep your voice down.

568
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:33,079
Slow down, slow down.

569
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:34,680
Slow down, slow down.

570
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:37,960
Let’s go, let’s go.

571
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,119
Wait a moment.

572
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,079
What's wrong?

573
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,839
Where's your chief?

574
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,079
The chief is here.

575
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:46,799
I'll go call him for you.

576
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:47,240
Don't.

577
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,880
Tell your chief

578
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,119
to prepare something vegetarian.

579
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,640
Otherwise, I'll get a nosebleed again.

580
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,079
Uncle.

581
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:21,480
This Songlin Town

582
00:27:22,039 --> 00:27:23,480
doesn't look scary at all.

583
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:25,599
Do you think the people walking on the street

584
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,519
are all ghosts?

585
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:28,960
From what they say,

586
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:30,359
it's like the underworld.

587
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:42,319
Uncle.

588
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:45,000
We've already walked around this street twice.

589
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,119
What exactly is your plan?

590
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:02,640
Uncle.

591
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:05,400
Park's old ginseng shop is at the other end of the street.

592
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,920
Why are you watching this fur shop?

593
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:09,119
They also buy ginseng.

594
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,759
Uncle, let me do it.

595
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:28,839
Did you know

596
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:30,880
that the owner of this fur shop,

597
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,119
Mr. Zhu,

598
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,480
delivers food to our people in the forest?

599
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:36,279
I've dealt with him before.

600
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,240
So this is what you meant,

601
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:41,440
the Songlin Town contact point.

602
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:43,839
Are we staying here tonight?

603
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,119
It's so late.

604
00:28:48,039 --> 00:28:49,880
Let's not disturb them now.

605
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:52,160
We'll talk tomorrow.

606
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:55,519
Let's go.

607
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,599
This place is nice.

608
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:08,720
This is the spot.

609
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:18,359
Xiao Gui.

610
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,519
Sir,

611
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:53,680
Our shop is already closed.

612
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,279
Sorry to bother you.

613
00:29:56,839 --> 00:29:57,640
May I have some water?

614
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,359
All guests are welcome here.

615
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,240
Please come in.

616
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,839
Sir, after you.

617
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,920
Brother, have a seat.

618
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,759
Hei Hu, serve the tea.

619
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,319
Brother,

620
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:23,559
May I ask your surname?

621
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,200
Just Zhu.

622
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:27,279
What a coincidence.

623
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,680
We're from the same family.

624
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:29,640
Where are you from?

625
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,640
Mudanjiang.

626
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:32,039
You've come to the right place.

627
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,480
Here in Songlin Town,

628
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,000
treasures come from all directions.

629
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,680
Guests arrive from everywhere.

630
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:38,880
Hearing that,

631
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,359
the shopkeeper must be a local.

632
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,559
Born and raised here.

633
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,400
And your ancestors?

634
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:43,519
Huang County, Shandong.

635
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,319
Please.

636
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,319
Brother,

637
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:03,400
Are you here looking for relatives?

638
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:06,759
They say Xinglong's furs

639
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:09,319
are always a safe buy.

640
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:10,960
You're too kind.

641
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,920
This way, brother.

642
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:44,759
Old Dong's hides

643
00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:46,519
The oil content is a bit low

644
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:47,640
An expert

645
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,200
You can tell you're an expert as soon as you speak

646
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:50,759
Brother

647
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,559
After the first snowfall

648
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,240
Come back then

649
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:54,519
I guarantee you'll be satisfied

650
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:57,480
Boss

651
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,359
The goods I want are a bit different

652
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:01,799
Take a look

653
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:06,799
Hei Hu

654
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:08,240
You go back first

655
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,680
Close the door

656
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,279
Brother,

657
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:10,200
let's be honest.

658
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,519
Boss,

659
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,440
I want your best hidden goods.

660
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,960
It's just a small business.

661
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,200
What secret stock do you have?

662
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,279
Tiger pelts, bear pelts.

663
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,359
I need to see a deposit first.

664
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:37,519
That's not very honest of you.

665
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:39,240
How am I not being honest?

666
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,440
Behind you,

667
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,559
aren't you hiding a few human skins too?

668
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:27,599
The crooks are running wild.

669
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:28,800
Old Walnut.

670
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:30,519
Watch out, you might get hit by a bullet.

671
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,480
Men die for wealth, birds for food.

672
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:35,000
Firecrackers went off.

673
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,800
I got a good start.

674
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:50,119
What's going on?

675
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,159
It's nothing.

676
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,280
Call me if you need anything.

677
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,119
Just go to sleep.

678
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,320
What's wrong, Uncle?

679
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:05,039
Can't sleep.

680
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:07,360
Why me?

681
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,519
Why did I think I heard gunshots?

682
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,280
Did you hear it?

683
00:35:13,239 --> 00:35:13,840
No.

684
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,079
Go to sleep, go to sleep.

685
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,480
Come on, sleep.

686
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,400
Gui'er.

687
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,559
Early tomorrow morning,

688
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:45,159
go to town.

689
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,440
Check out the fur shop.

690
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,000
Keep your distance from it.

691
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:54,760
In my heart,

692
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,840
I just feel uneasy.

693
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,360
Alright.

694
00:36:00,039 --> 00:36:00,760
Leave it to me.

695
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,679
Go to sleep, Uncle.

696
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,000
Sir

697
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,519
There are four members of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army hidden in the compartment.

698
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:46,920
One of them is still alive.

699
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,960
I left him alive on purpose.

700
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,880
Take him back for treatment.

701
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:00,639
I want to interrogate him myself.

702
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:02,519
He'll be very useful.

703
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:03,280
Yes, sir.

704
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,400
Take him away.

705
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,559
You guys,

706
00:37:25,559 --> 00:37:26,760
always slacking off,

707
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,920
put in some effort today.

708
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:30,360
Or I'll execute you on the spot.

709
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,440
Move it, hurry up!

710
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,360
That's all.

711
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,239
That's it.

712
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:07,239
Go check again.

713
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,039
If you ask me,

714
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,760
Around these mountains,

715
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,360
North and south of the Three Rivers,

716
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,119
besides the Japanese,

717
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,800
there's only one person

718
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:27,039
who dares to kill like this.

719
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,440
You mean You Shilong?

720
00:38:31,159 --> 00:38:31,760
Little Copper Leg.

721
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,239
Anything new?

722
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:34,800
Share it with us brothers.

723
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,519
Let us in on it.

724
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,880
Look at this kid.

725
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:39,679
Come on, eat up.

726
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,000
Nothing new under the sun.

727
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,840
Boss Zhu met with disaster.

728
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,800
Even in the hands of the King of Hell,

729
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:47,719
it's a mess of debts.

730
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,079
The Japanese did it.

731
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,159
We pay the money,

732
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,159
and Lord Pang protects us.

733
00:38:57,559 --> 00:38:58,400
In this town,

734
00:38:58,519 --> 00:38:59,920
the Japanese haven't come for years.

735
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:01,559
That's true.

736
00:39:02,559 --> 00:39:03,679
We're just chatting here.

737
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:05,280
But Lord Pang right now

738
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,320
is so busy he can't catch his breath.

739
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:12,400
He's like a beggar rushing at dawn.

740
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:13,440
Busy for nothing.

741
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,320
Isn't that right, Big Branch?

742
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,039
Can't compare to you.

743
00:39:17,239 --> 00:39:18,800
Snails work at night for food.

744
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:19,840
Exactly.

745
00:39:20,239 --> 00:39:21,639
I've been busy all night.

746
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,320
These old bones of mine

747
00:39:23,639 --> 00:39:25,159
are tough as diamonds.

748
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:26,719
Bring some good wine.

749
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,719
Back then,

750
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,599
I fled to Songlin Town.

751
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,000
Boss Zhu's father

752
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,519
gave me my first meal.

753
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:49,280
He even guided me

754
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,000
to work at the coffin shop.

755
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,679
In a blink, it's been almost forty years.

756
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:57,960
Boss Zhu deserves it.

757
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:02,800
Boss Zhu is blessed.

758
00:40:03,159 --> 00:40:05,119
Just happened to have a new set of wood.

759
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,639
So I

760
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,119
told the workers to rush it overnight.

761
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:10,440
Put on the lacquer.

762
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,119
This batch of wood

763
00:40:13,639 --> 00:40:14,719
isn't great quality.

764
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,400
That's why Big Branch is so clever.

765
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,599
The material is average.

766
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:25,840
But

767
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:27,880
it helps in a pinch.

768
00:40:29,239 --> 00:40:30,559
Please be kind.

769
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:32,039
Please be kind.

770
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:36,519
Please be kind.

771
00:40:36,719 --> 00:40:37,559
Please be kind.

772
00:40:37,559 --> 00:40:38,840
Mountain goods for sale!

773
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:41,599
Please be kind.

774
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:43,119
Come, check out the mountain goods!

775
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:55,400
Take a look at the mountain goods!

776
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:02,920
Old Walnut.

777
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,679
Did the Japanese really do this?

778
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:11,360
Was it the Japanese?

779
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:16,400
I don't know if it was the Japanese.

780
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,159
Little Copper Leg.

781
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:19,039
Get me a bowl of water.

782
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:20,559
Last night I went

783
00:41:21,159 --> 00:41:23,280
Boss Zhu's chest was this big

784
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,239
This big.

785
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:28,400
Blood was gushing out.

786
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:30,119
The shelf was overturned.

787
00:41:30,519 --> 00:41:33,239
There was a hidden compartment behind the shelf.

788
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:35,199
There were three people in that compartment.

789
00:41:37,239 --> 00:41:38,360
All wearing

790
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:42,119
the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army uniforms.

791
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,039
Their bodies were full of bullet holes.

792
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:54,559
I'm back.

793
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:58,559
Uncle.

794
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:00,840
The fur shop is gone.

795
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,480
What happened?

796
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:07,480
Thinking about it, it was really close.

797
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:09,880
If the two of us

798
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:11,360
had rested at the transit station last night,

799
00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:13,239
wouldn't we have also

800
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:15,039
most likely been targeted by the Japanese?

801
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:16,480
They'd been watching that place for a while.

802
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,079
Enemies are everywhere.

803
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,400
Besides the Japanese,

804
00:42:24,159 --> 00:42:24,960
there are puppet soldiers,

805
00:42:25,239 --> 00:42:26,000
and traitors.

806
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:29,400
From now on, when we do things

807
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:32,360
we must be extra careful.

808
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:34,559
Now the transit station is gone too.

809
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,400
Where can we find the main force now?

810
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:44,119
Let's deal with this ginseng first.

811
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:45,880
Take care of it.

812
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,920
Then head straight to Bakesong.

813
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:52,239
See how many of our people made it back.

814
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:54,840
As long as they're alive,

815
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,440
everything else can be sorted out.

816
00:42:57,639 --> 00:42:58,199
Uncle,

817
00:42:58,599 --> 00:42:59,480
at that tavern,

818
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,679
I met the old mountain spirit's contact,

819
00:43:00,679 --> 00:43:01,599
that was Boss Park.
