1
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:50,799
Ma

2
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:54,840
Your eyes

3
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:58,200
are completely

4
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,280
blind now

5
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,400
Yeah

6
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,120
Ma's getting old

7
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:05,200
Besides

8
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,879
I'm used to it now

9
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,360
Pa

10
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:17,800
What happened to your leg?

11
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:19,840
Well

12
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,039
A while back

13
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,560
We really had nothing to eat

14
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,479
So your pa thought

15
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,280
he'd go hunt some wild chickens

16
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:30,360
but ran into a bear

17
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,759
The bear smacked your pa

18
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:33,840
right into the ditch

19
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,319
And the bear

20
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,280
maybe wasn't hungry that day

21
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,120
didn't go after him

22
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,479
just turned and left

23
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,879
That's how your pa survived

24
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:46,199
Lucky to be alive

25
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,240
Son

26
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,800
Now that you're back

27
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,080
how long will you stay?

28
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:02,919
I'm not leaving

29
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:05,280
Not leaving

30
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:07,840
Good, good

31
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,039
Glad you're staying

32
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:11,199
If you want to go, just go

33
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,879
Don't worry about things at home

34
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,080
Mountain folks

35
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,439
are all tough

36
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,639
Rest a couple days and you'll be fine

37
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:25,759
Son

38
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,879
Where are you going?

39
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:29,960
I'm chopping some firewood for home

40
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,120
We've still got firewood

41
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,680
Why do you

42
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,400
say those things to the kid?

43
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,199
He'll get restless

44
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,039
If you don't let him go

45
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:51,639
he'll still leave

46
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,840
No

47
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,599
You have to think of something

48
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,840
I don't want my son

49
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:00,159
to die out there

50
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,360
Come

51
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,840
I get it now

52
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,439
You Shilong is too evil

53
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:12,080
We have to take him out

54
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,159
Right

55
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:14,479
Get rid of him for the people

56
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:16,120
Otherwise he'll keep hurting folks

57
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,519
Isn't that right?

58
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,079
Yeah

59
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,439
But

60
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,920
Right now

61
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,040
besides his voice

62
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:26,920
I don't even know what he looks like

63
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,000
I have no idea

64
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,839
Don't worry

65
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:31,360
We'll catch him sooner or later

66
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,079
and finish him off

67
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:36,720
Those eight pine trees

68
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,920
Did you go check them out?

69
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:39,240
Yeah

70
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:42,360
Who carved words on them?

71
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:46,800
The Japanese were searching the mountain then

72
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,600
I didn't dare get closer

73
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:54,680
Let's take out You Shilong

74
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,480
then go check it out together

75
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,319
Deal?

76
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,160
Deal

77
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,680
Come on

78
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,600
He likes to sing

79
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,800
so he must like listening too

80
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,759
When he listens

81
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:15,279
he'll hum along

82
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:16,439
Right?

83
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:19,079
We're thinking the same thing

84
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:20,560
Otherwise today

85
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,959
we wouldn't have met there

86
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,279
This guy

87
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:31,879
His brother came too

88
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,199
The whole family is eating big

89
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:35,759
Not for free

90
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,240
They're working

91
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:38,879
You're just naive

92
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,600
Times are so chaotic

93
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,800
Don't end up

94
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,839
getting tricked by someone

95
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:45,079
I trust him

96
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:50,120
Sis

97
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,560
Let me tell you something

98
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,480
This guy

99
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:55,720
I've got my eye on him

100
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:02,800
What's so good about him?

101
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,600
Everything about him is good.

102
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,959
All these years,

103
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:08,839
I've never met anyone as good as him.

104
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,560
If you can say that,

105
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,920
you better hold on tight.

106
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,800
With your sister's sharp eyes,

107
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:19,399
she's got her sights set.

108
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,560
She won't let him get away.

109
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,079
I believe that.

110
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:29,480
Sis,

111
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,319
It's getting colder.

112
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:33,920
Maybe don't go out anymore.

113
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,160
You think I want to leave?

114
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:37,879
Who wouldn't want to stay here on a cozy heated bed?

115
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:38,920
Snacking on some sunflower seeds at home,

116
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,160
that's so comfortable.

117
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:42,720
But if someone invites us, we have to go.

118
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:43,560
Gotta earn money.

119
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,160
If you don't want to leave,

120
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,279
just stay.

121
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,800
I'll take care of you.

122
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:51,680
Then I really have to go.

123
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:54,279
I knew it.

124
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,879
You're ambitious.

125
00:06:57,839 --> 00:06:58,600
Sis,

126
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,000
Remember,

127
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:01,959
no matter where you go,

128
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,439
you'll always have a home in Songlin Town.

129
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:07,000
I'll be waiting for you at home.

130
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:13,879
Oh Ma,

131
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,120
my leg's gone numb.

132
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:16,959
I've got a cramp.

133
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,120
Don't say that.

134
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,199
Alright.

135
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:23,199
Wait here.

136
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:25,800
I'll make you some meat and egg dumplings.

137
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,439
Miss me?

138
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,399
No,

139
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,560
um,

140
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:39,079
I want to ask Little Red Date something.

141
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,519
Ask her about You Shilong.

142
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,480
If you drag her into this,

143
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:51,079
I won't forgive you.

144
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,759
Don't worry, I wouldn't dare.

145
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:55,360
Just want to ask something.

146
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,800
I'm making dumplings, want some?

147
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:08,879
Come on, follow me.

148
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:12,600
Tielin,

149
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,319
Uncle,

150
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,120
I heard you got hurt.

151
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:16,560
I found a doctor.

152
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,240
Take a look.

153
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:20,079
It's not a big deal.

154
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:22,879
This...

155
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,000
This...

156
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,279
This is really serious.

157
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,079
He'll survive,

158
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,039
but in the end,

159
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,000
he'll probably be disabled.

160
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,360
And to treat this,

161
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,000
he'll have to spend a lot of money.

162
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,000
Stop talking nonsense.

163
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,960
If I chop off a leg with an axe,

164
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,200
cut off a leg,

165
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,080
he can still live.

166
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,480
What do I need you for?

167
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:45,120
Just treat me.

168
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,240
Hurry up.

169
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:48,480
Let me tell you,

170
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,840
money's not a problem.

171
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:52,399
Just make sure you treat me well.

172
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:55,759
Why are you here?

173
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,159
Why are you talking to Tielin?

174
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Tielin specially invited the doctor

175
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:03,480
to check your Pa's leg.

176
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,080
I'm asking you.

177
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:08,600
Doctors these days are tricky.

178
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:09,799
They exaggerate the illness

179
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:10,600
to charge more.

180
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:11,799
Money...

181
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:15,320
I...

182
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:19,919
Say something.

183
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:20,679
Yes.

184
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,879
I want to ask you something.

185
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,600
All these years you've been performing opera,

186
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:26,840
has any man

187
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,240
ever played a female role on stage?

188
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,440
Why do you ask?

189
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:34,279
You want to go on stage?

190
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,200
No, no, no.

191
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:35,960
No, no.

192
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,320
I'm just curious, asking randomly.

193
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,120
Why should I tell you?

194
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:41,159
I... I...

195
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:47,919
Can you shell some sunflower seeds for me?

196
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,080
Go ahead and ask.

197
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,360
You really are curious.

198
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:02,919
Alright, stop messing with me.

199
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,879
You and your sister are really alike.

200
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,480
Just tell me.

201
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,480
Alright.

202
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,240
For my sister's sake,

203
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,519
I'll tell you a bit.

204
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,120
Let me put it this way.

205
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:15,480
Ours here,

206
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,679
is a street opera stage.

207
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:17,840
You can perform on any stage.

208
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:20,000
You can even perform at home on the heated bed.

209
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:21,799
If you're cold in winter,

210
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:23,799
and there's no stage around,

211
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,639
just flatten a manure pile and use it as a stage.

212
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:26,279
You can still perform.

213
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:27,840
Men can play women, women can play men.

214
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:29,000
Sing however you want.

215
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:30,759
As for the audience,

216
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:32,200
if they get hooked,

217
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:34,320
they can get on stage and join in for fun.

218
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,720
As long as you tip,

219
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:36,600
even chickens, ducks, cats, and dogs

220
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:37,840
can get on stage and show off their voices.

221
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,039
Pour some water.

222
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:42,720
Alright, alright.

223
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,320
So,

224
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,120
in our Songlin Town,

225
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:49,440
has anyone performed on stage?

226
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:50,879
Plenty.

227
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:52,440
All the shopkeepers love it.

228
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:53,440
Pang Ye likes it too.

229
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:54,240
Pang Ye.

230
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,320
You know Pang Ye, right?

231
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,039
I do.

232
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,080
Is he any good?

233
00:10:58,279 --> 00:10:59,240
Not at all.

234
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,519
To me, he's just a joke.

235
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:02,639
Just there to make people laugh.

236
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:05,159
Alright.

237
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,679
How about this,

238
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:08,799
help me out.

239
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,120
With what?

240
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,279
I told you,

241
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,120
don't drag Xiao Hongzao

242
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:15,120
into this.

243
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:16,759
Yeah, I know.

244
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,360
I'm out of options.

245
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:19,919
This is the only way left.

246
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:21,639
Still can't do it.

247
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:24,120
Besides, she's leaving tomorrow.

248
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:26,240
She doesn't have time for your business.

249
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,639
That's why we need to hurry.

250
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,360
I promise I'll keep it clean.

251
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,320
Is that okay?

252
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:32,080
What if something goes wrong?

253
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,080
You want my life?

254
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,480
Who wants that?

255
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:38,360
Don't worry.

256
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,200
I won't let anyone who helps me

257
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,480
get into trouble.

258
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,200
No room for negotiation.

259
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:46,080
You...

260
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:50,360
Fine.

261
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,960
Giving me attitude?

262
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:54,759
No.

263
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:56,080
When did I ever do that?

264
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:56,960
If you want my life,

265
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,639
I'd give it to you.

266
00:11:57,639 --> 00:11:58,320
I promise in this life

267
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,320
I'll never give you attitude.

268
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,000
Stop right there.

269
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:04,799
Come here.

270
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,600
Come here.

271
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,200
What did you just say?

272
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,000
I said my life is yours.

273
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,600
You fool.

274
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:41,440
About this favor,

275
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:43,240
it's not that I can't help.

276
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:45,720
But why is he doing it?

277
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,879
I can't say.

278
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,240
You can't even tell me?

279
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:58,720
Just think of this favor

280
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:00,679
as helping my sister.

281
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:04,159
What are you doing? Look at you.

282
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:05,879
Sis, you spoke up.

283
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,039
I can drop this deal, no problem.

284
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:10,840
Your business is my business.

285
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:14,840
Thanks, sis.

286
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,879
He promised me.

287
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,080
He won't let anything happen to you.

288
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:25,279
Sis.

289
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,159
I trust you.

290
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,639
About the old man's illness,

291
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,240
Hurry up.

292
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:52,919
Go ahead.

293
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,679
Speak.

294
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,519
Back then, you said,

295
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:13,879
it wasn't your brother who died.

296
00:14:13,879 --> 00:14:15,080
If it had been you,

297
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:18,360
how would your Ma and Pa have handled it?

298
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:23,720
What are you looking at?

299
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,360
Listen to yourself.

300
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,759
Why wasn't it you who died?

301
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,080
Good point.

302
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:22,399
Fuqing

303
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,519
Fuqing

304
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,120
Old Tang

305
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,480
Why did you leave by yourself?

306
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,039
Old Tang

307
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:33,759
Fuqing

308
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,559
Son

309
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,440
Come back quickly

310
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:50,799
Son, come back quickly

311
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,440
Ma

312
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,120
Come back

313
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,960
Had another nightmare?

314
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:56,919
Why couldn't you sleep peacefully all night?

315
00:15:57,639 --> 00:15:58,679
Are you alright?

316
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,559
I'm fine

317
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:01,679
I'm fine, Ma

318
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,039
Ma

319
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:08,200
Go get some sleep

320
00:16:12,919 --> 00:16:13,759
This kid

321
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:16,840
Why can't he ever sleep soundly?

322
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:51,000
Elder Monk

323
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:57,720
Could it be someone outside the curtain wall

324
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:02,480
talking?

325
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:08,799
What's up?

326
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:09,720
What are you all doing?

327
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:11,279
I fell asleep listening

328
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,200
Applaud!

329
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:12,799
Yeah

330
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:13,960
Applaud!

331
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:14,920
Alright

332
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,400
Everyone here,

333
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:18,559
the two of us brothers

334
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,799
have been singing for days

335
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,680
We're happy today

336
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:21,880
So, how about

337
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,759
not just the two of us

338
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:23,680
singing here

339
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,079
If anyone in the audience loves opera

340
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,279
don't just hum along down there

341
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:26,920
come up here

342
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,279
Right

343
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:28,440
let's all have fun together

344
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:29,039
How about it?

345
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:30,240
Alright, alright, alright

346
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,200
Yeah, so

347
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,039
Pang, Pangye, Pangye

348
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:34,799
Yes, Pangye, Pangye, Pangye

349
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,319
Pangye, give us one

350
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:37,359
Pangye

351
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,200
Why don't you come up

352
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,319
and set an example for everyone

353
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:40,400
I can't

354
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:41,799
My voice isn't good

355
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,240
Pangye

356
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:44,880
If you just sing a note

357
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,079
the whole Songlin Town

358
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:47,240
will be shaken three times

359
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,359
That's true

360
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:50,400
There's always someone better

361
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,599
and a higher sky above

362
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:53,079
If you don't come up

363
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,519
no one else will dare

364
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:56,200
That's right

365
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,000
Come on up

366
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:57,839
Then I

367
00:17:59,160 --> 00:17:59,920
I'll just

368
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,640
play the huqin

369
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,720
Alright, alright, alright

370
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,480
Sounds good

371
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,759
Playing huqin doesn't need a tip, right?

372
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:07,759
Give a bit more

373
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,720
Give a bit more

374
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:09,559
We'll see

375
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:12,880
Oh Ma

376
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,039
Rules are fine

377
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,000
You'll still get paid

378
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,480
Alright, alright

379
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,440
Pangye is generous

380
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:25,160
So, what about you guys

381
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,599
Who's coming up to sing?

382
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:27,480
Well, well

383
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,359
Shopkeeper Park

384
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,039
"The Romance of the West Chamber" is your specialty

385
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:31,799
Come on, show us your voice

386
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:32,880
Let everyone see your skills

387
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,680
Shopkeeper Jin

388
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,359
I'm just an amateur

389
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,400
When it comes to singing

390
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,079
it's got to be you, Shopkeeper Jin

391
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,680
Why don't you set an example first

392
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:41,960
Yes, Shopkeeper Jin, give us one

393
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,920
Come on, come on

394
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,319
Shopkeeper Jin, please

395
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:45,200
No

396
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:47,440
Let me start and inspire everyone

397
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,920
Why no applause yet?

398
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,400
Alright, alright, alright

399
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:53,640
Thank you, Shopkeeper Jin

400
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:54,559
Can't be bad

401
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:55,920
That's generous

402
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:58,279
So, do you sing the lead or supporting role?

403
00:18:58,359 --> 00:18:59,880
My voice can only do supporting roles

404
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,000
I can't do the lead

405
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:01,839
Alright then

406
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:03,039
Let's continue from where we left off

407
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:03,920
Pangye

408
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,799
You start

409
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,759
Alright

410
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:35,319
Could it be the goldfish in the pond

411
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:41,400
swishing around on the surface

412
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:43,839
Alright

413
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:48,880
Could it be the night watchman

414
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,519
knocking on the night watch

415
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:56,200
Take care

416
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:13,759
Suffocated in the garden.

417
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,119
Ten, ten, seventeen.

418
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:17,160
Ten, eighteen.

419
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:17,640
Oh Ma!

420
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,519
How did you forget the lyrics?

421
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,039
How could you forget while singing?

422
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,039
Forgot, forgot, forgot.

423
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:25,160
But Boss Jin,

424
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,839
you're a real expert.

425
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:28,200
No, I can't compare to you.

426
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:28,720
Can't compare to you.

427
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,599
If you keep singing like this,

428
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,319
I won't have food to eat.

429
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:32,160
No, no, no.

430
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,000
Here, here, quickly, it's yours.

431
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:34,799
Just showing off a bit.

432
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:35,680
Just showing off, everyone.

433
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:36,839
Good.

434
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,920
Master Pang, Master Pang, Master Pang.

435
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:39,599
Just showing off, just showing off.

436
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,480
You're also half a jar of vinegar sloshing around.

437
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:43,200
Good.

438
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,720
Just half a jar of vinegar.

439
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:46,160
No.

440
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,319
So, anyone in the audience,

441
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:48,160
who can sing this part?

442
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,279
Who can sing? Come up!

443
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:50,000
I'll do it.

444
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,480
Master Pang, Master Pang, Master Pang.

445
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:57,240
Hair tied up in a bun.

446
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,079
Bun with hair tied up.

447
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,519
Two big girls.

448
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,440
Good.

449
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,200
Good, good, good.

450
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,519
Still needs Master Pang.

451
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:39,880
That was sung really well just now.

452
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:40,759
This "Great West Chamber"

453
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,039
Especially Boss Jin,

454
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:43,279
his singing was

455
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,240
as authentic as fart after eating beans.

456
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:46,640
So authentic.

457
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,039
I'll sing a part from "Great West Chamber" too.

458
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,240
Go ahead.

459
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,359
The hardest one.

460
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:53,359
The Four Orphaned Hats.

461
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:55,200
From the Four Orphaned Hats,

462
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:56,559
"Zhang Sheng Visits the Temple."

463
00:21:56,759 --> 00:21:57,960
This hat is good, this one.

464
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,720
Come on, band master, get ready.

465
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:01,039
Sing a part from "Zhang Sheng Visits the Temple."

466
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:01,720
Please.

467
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:11,440
Good, good, good.

468
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:16,640
Sang as young Zhang Sheng.

469
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,240
Is it him?

470
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:18,680
Don't rush, don't rush.

471
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,480
Sing as young Zhang Sheng.

472
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:40,720
Zhang Sheng visited the temple.

473
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:44,359
and met Cui Yingying.

474
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,400
Okay

475
00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:06,799
Little Copper Legs

476
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,160
Time to work

477
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:14,559
Alright, Boss Huang

478
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,400
Applause

479
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:17,039
This aria is too high

480
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:17,640
Way too high

481
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,519
You and me

482
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:19,119
What?

483
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:19,599
Switch it up

484
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,160
Switch what?

485
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,160
Let's do a duet

486
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:23,079
Pick a tough one from "The Romance of the West Chamber"

487
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:24,079
How about "Prescribing Medicine"?

488
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:25,599
That's a good one, really good

489
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:26,839
Boss Huang

490
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,839
I know "Prescribing Medicine"

491
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,440
Let me sing a couple lines

492
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,680
Alright, alright

493
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,960
Come on, come on

494
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:35,279
Applause, applause

495
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,720
Come on

496
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,200
Did you bring money?

497
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,559
Can't break the rules

498
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:43,759
Here

499
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,759
We have to pay

500
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:47,799
Thanks, Boss

501
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,279
Master Pang

502
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,240
After you

503
00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:51,200
Let's go

504
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,920
Stole fifty taels of deer antler

505
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:02,079
Also stole mercury and musk

506
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:05,880
Even startled the atractylodes, making it squeal

507
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,480
The golden-haired dog barked like crazy

508
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:13,839
No rice to cook today

509
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:14,720
What I'm worried about is

510
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,720
This month

511
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:17,839
These meat patties

512
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,720
Still not cooked?

513
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:24,160
Riding a seahorse to fetch galangal

514
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,720
All the way to Realgar Hill

515
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,680
Is it him?

516
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:30,920
Yes

517
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:32,960
Caught the softshell and wood turtles

518
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,759
Real brothers

519
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:38,519
Grabbed the bletilla and cut it open

520
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:41,880
If you ask what this medicine cures

521
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,720
It cures men and women alike

522
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,839
Young and old

523
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:46,960
All kinds of ailments

524
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:52,799
Coughs, dry throats, and more

525
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,359
Alright

526
00:24:58,279 --> 00:24:58,920
Come on, try it on

527
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,720
Sis, I'll do it myself

528
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,000
Try it, try it

529
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,240
Got new clothes

530
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,279
How is it?

531
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:08,720
Not too long, not too short

532
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:09,680
Not too loose, not too tight

533
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:10,519
Just right

534
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,160
Sis

535
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,400
Yours fits perfectly too

536
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:13,319
Sis

537
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:14,680
How did you know our sizes?

538
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,240
You never measured us

539
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,839
Your clothes were drying outside that day

540
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,160
I measured them casually

541
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,480
How can we thank you?

542
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:23,559
We're all family

543
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,799
No need for formalities

544
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,079
Wake up on the first day of the Lunar New Year

545
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,279
And put on these new clothes

546
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:31,079
Then head out

547
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,880
Wear new clothes for the New Year

548
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,759
Festive

549
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,759
Festive

550
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,680
Festive

551
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:41,160
What's wrong?

552
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,839
Sis

553
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,119
To be honest

554
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:48,240
Since Ma passed away

555
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,640
I haven't

556
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,000
worn new clothes for New Year

557
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,039
What are you doing?

558
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,039
Now you have me

559
00:25:57,319 --> 00:25:59,200
I'll make sure you have new clothes every year

560
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:06,119
Hold it in

561
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,640
Sis

562
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,359
Okay

563
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:12,599
As long as you like it

564
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,599
I like it, I do

565
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,279
I like it

566
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,359
Thank you, Sis

567
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,680
Come on, button it up

568
00:28:56,519 --> 00:28:57,519
What are you up to?

569
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,480
Can I ask you for a favor?

570
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:00,720
What is it?

571
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:02,279
I'm craving dumplings.

572
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,960
Could you make some dumplings for me?

573
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,400
Sure.

574
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,400
What filling do you want?

575
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:10,880
Any filling is fine.

576
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:12,440
Anything you make tastes great.

577
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,279
Where are you going?

578
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,839
I have something to take care of.

579
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:21,200
Come back later, okay?

580
00:29:22,279 --> 00:29:23,400
Will you really come back?

581
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,039
Definitely.

582
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:36,680
Go ahead.

583
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:33,279
Daughter-in-law, have a seat.

584
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:38,000
Wangcai.

585
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,440
Wangcai.

586
00:30:40,359 --> 00:30:41,119
This coffin of yours,

587
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:42,680
why did you put it in the middle of the road?

588
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:43,640
Uh...

589
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:45,559
Who are you?

590
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,359
Let me tell you who I am.

591
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:48,279
Do you know me?

592
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,200
If you don't speak up,

593
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:50,039
I'll call for help.

594
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:50,680
Don't move.

595
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,599
Move and I'll kill you.

596
00:30:58,039 --> 00:30:58,880
You Shilong.

597
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:01,799
Who's You Shilong?

598
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:03,359
You must have the wrong person.

599
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,039
Show me your real self.

600
00:31:04,039 --> 00:31:04,799
Reveal it now.

601
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,559
Hurry up.

602
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:06,480
Don't stab me.

603
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,119
Brother,

604
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,759
let's talk this out.

605
00:31:10,839 --> 00:31:12,039
You hid yourself well.

606
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:13,920
I didn't expect

607
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,200
today's drama

608
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,519
was set up by you two.

609
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:17,519
You prepared it for me.

610
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:19,319
I'm afraid you're not just You Shilong.

611
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,680
You're also Japanese, aren't you?

612
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,039
Don't say things like that.

613
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:27,039
Explain yourselves.

614
00:31:27,079 --> 00:31:27,960
You Japanese eat

615
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:29,680
with chopsticks placed horizontally.

616
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,079
But you made sure to put them vertically.

617
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:38,359
And that guy with you,

618
00:31:38,839 --> 00:31:40,079
the way he bows and nods,

619
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:41,559
he's clearly not Chinese.

620
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:43,119
So he's Japanese too.

621
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:44,279
Isn't that right?

622
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:45,960
He's Japanese.

623
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:47,440
But I'm not.

624
00:31:47,799 --> 00:31:48,880
Listen to how I talk.

625
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,160
Do I sound Japanese?

626
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,759
Then why did you sing a Japanese song?

627
00:31:53,319 --> 00:31:57,440
"Sakura, sakura..."

628
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:00,519
Didn't I just learn it from that Japanese guy?

629
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,000
Doesn't matter if you're Japanese or not.

630
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:04,039
You're dying today.

631
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,119
Brother,

632
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,680
in this world,

633
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,359
everything and everyone

634
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:10,079
has a price.

635
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,680
Name your price.

636
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:12,960
Isn't this

637
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,359
just a matter of your word?

638
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:15,200
Alright.

639
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,720
So, what do you think I'm worth?

640
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:19,200
How much am I worth to you?

641
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:21,079
I'll give you everything I have.

642
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,079
I'll hand it all over.

643
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,000
Is that enough?

644
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,240
But what about

645
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,240
all those people who died?

646
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,160
Boss Zhu from Xinglong Fur Shop,

647
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,559
what grudge did you have against him?

648
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:35,240
He colluded with the Anti-Japanese Forces and sheltered bandits.

649
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:35,759
He...

650
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,559
He deserved to die.

651
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:44,519
Open your eyes, you dog.

652
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,960
Let me tell you something.

653
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:48,039
Both of us are with the Anti-Japanese Forces.

654
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,920
So today,

655
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,640
I guess I have to die, huh?

656
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:57,599
Listen up, both of you.

657
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,279
If you kill me,

658
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,359
it won't go unnoticed.

659
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,279
The Imperial Army will definitely turn Songlin Town

660
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:04,440
upside down.

661
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:06,279
You two won't be able to escape then.

662
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,160
You'll lose your lives too.

663
00:33:08,359 --> 00:33:09,200
So you admit

664
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,200
you're Japanese?

665
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,079
So what if I am?

666
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,079
Then I'll finish you off right now.

667
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,640
Speak.

668
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:18,240
How did you learn to speak Chinese?

669
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,720
Why are you so fluent?

670
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,240
I came to China with my father

671
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,160
when I was a child.

672
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:26,440
In the blink of an eye,

673
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,279
it's been almost thirty years.

674
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,720
You're quite the seasoned Japanese informant.

675
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,279
You blend in among the people,

676
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,680
neither human nor ghost,

677
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,640
doing monstrous things.

678
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,359
Spying for information,

679
00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:40,960
killing our people,

680
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:42,799
stealing our belongings.

681
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,319
Go settle the score with the Imperial Army.

682
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,440
They took over all of Northeast China.

683
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:55,359
Then they kicked us low-level informants

684
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:56,799
to the curb.

685
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,279
We're just meat on the chopping block for the Imperial Army.

686
00:33:58,359 --> 00:34:00,039
Just meat on the board.

687
00:34:02,279 --> 00:34:04,279
If we're meat, you're just rotten meat.

688
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:06,079
Still trying to argue?

689
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,000
How many Anti-Japanese fighters have you killed?

690
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,519
How many civilians have you killed?

691
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,000
Today, you pay with your life.

692
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,079
Looks like

693
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:25,760
my time is up today.

694
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:28,639
Hey, hero,

695
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,519
I run a coffin shop.

696
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:35,960
If you make me lie in a coffin,

697
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,960
I'll be dead for sure.

698
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:43,400
At least let me die in one piece.

699
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,119
Stop!

700
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:08,760
Just right.

701
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,519
Eat while it's hot.

702
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:31,239
Come on, dig in.

703
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:32,519
Dumplings.

704
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,239
Is there any vinegar?

705
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:35,519
This seems to be...

706
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:36,320
That's wine.

707
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:38,239
Garlic.

708
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,360
Forget it, never mind.

709
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,400
Tasty.

710
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:52,599
Master

711
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:53,760
Master

712
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,119
Master

713
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,199
Master

714
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,480
Master

715
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:08,599
Xiao Gui

716
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,760
Son

717
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,679
Wake up

718
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:19,599
Say something to Pa

719
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:25,920
Don't scare Pa

720
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,480
Master

721
00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:32,800
Young Master

722
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,159
Young Master is coming around

723
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,079
Gui'er

724
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:42,599
What?

725
00:40:42,679 --> 00:40:43,639
Rabbit

726
00:40:47,039 --> 00:40:47,960
Rabbit

727
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:49,440
Stomach

728
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:51,840
Young Master is hungry

729
00:40:53,719 --> 00:40:54,440
Rabbit

730
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,239
No, Master

731
00:40:56,639 --> 00:40:58,480
Yeah, seems like a rabbit

732
00:41:01,239 --> 00:41:01,840
What?

733
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:03,519
Rabbit

734
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,320
Yes

735
00:41:04,519 --> 00:41:05,320
It's a rabbit

736
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:07,320
Young Master wants to eat rabbit meat, right?

737
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:10,280
Wants to eat rabbit

738
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,920
The rabbit did a somersault

739
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:16,559
So embarrassing

740
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,119
Gotta chew it up

741
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,159
Chew it up

742
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,440
Changshun

743
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:24,119
Go

744
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,440
Catch that rabbit

745
00:41:25,639 --> 00:41:26,280
Boil it

746
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:28,239
Master

747
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,719
That rabbit, it...

748
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:31,159
Where should I do it?

749
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,199
That rabbit

750
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:34,960
He—Xiao Gui said it's that one

751
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:35,920
Hurry, go, go

752
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:36,760
Alright, alright

753
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,480
I'm going now

754
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,119
Going now, it's that one

755
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,039
Who is it?

756
00:42:09,559 --> 00:42:10,360
Sis

757
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,039
Who?

758
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,039
Sis

759
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,280
Here

760
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:21,920
Don't be scared

761
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:25,840
Here

762
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:29,320
Who?

763
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:30,920
Sis
