1
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:53,840
Alright, alright.

2
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,359
Don't get hurt.

3
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:54,920
Okay.

4
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:55,719
Brothers,

5
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:57,719
I told you before,

6
00:01:58,439 --> 00:01:58,959
bringing you here

7
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:00,719
wasn't really to

8
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,280
guard the Tian family home.

9
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,359
It's to lead you

10
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:05,400
up the mountain to fight the Japanese invaders.

11
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,799
Why do we fight the Japanese?

12
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,639
Because if we don't drive them out,

13
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:12,960
we Chinese will never hold our heads high.

14
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,159
We'll never have good days.

15
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,159
We're doing this to protect

16
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:16,280
every family's home.

17
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,719
So this training

18
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,840
can't be sloppy at all.

19
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:22,159
We must take it seriously.

20
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,960
Go a bit faster.

21
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,879
That's enough, I'm leaving.

22
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:28,319
Alright.

23
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:28,919
Okay.

24
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,639
Take it slow.

25
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,400
Got it.

26
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:44,159
Why are you here?

27
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:47,120
Then I'll go.

28
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:48,479
Don't go.

29
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,560
Since you're here,

30
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:51,840
let's chat for a bit.

31
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:57,560
Where are you going?

32
00:02:58,639 --> 00:02:59,840
To your room.

33
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:00,919
For what?

34
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,080
I'm tired.

35
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:03,960
Going to sleep.

36
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:05,759
No,

37
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,080
you...

38
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,439
When you talk,

39
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:11,159
I can never keep up.

40
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:19,439
Someone should be able to.

41
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:25,520
Keep up with what?

42
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,560
Silly.

43
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,240
Just teasing you.

44
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:35,719
Brought you a jar of wine.

45
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:38,520
I didn't ask for wine.

46
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,199
You, you...

47
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:40,680
It's already here.

48
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:42,080
Are you drinking or not?

49
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,479
Not drinking, huh?

50
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:45,479
I'll drink, I'll drink.

51
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,439
So how do we settle this?

52
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,360
My tab.

53
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:56,840
Can you keep track?

54
00:03:59,159 --> 00:03:59,879
I can't.

55
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,280
Alright, stop standing there.

56
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,319
Come, sit and talk.

57
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:03,960
Can't sit.

58
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:05,039
What's wrong?

59
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:05,759
Busy at the shop.

60
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,800
It's fine, go ahead.

61
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,399
If you can't finish the wine,

62
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,720
remember to send it back to me.

63
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,879
Alright, stop staring.

64
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:33,439
If you keep looking, your eyes will pop out.

65
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:35,879
You came back at just the right time.

66
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,959
We just finished loading the goods.

67
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:39,560
I asked you before I left.

68
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,639
You said there was no work, so I left.

69
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,480
Work doesn’t just show up when you want.

70
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:45,439
I went to check.

71
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,759
Still just the five of us.

72
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,240
Not a single extra person.

73
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,720
You said the squad leader would come find us.

74
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,160
When is he coming?

75
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,480
Don’t rush.

76
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:57,759
He’s around here somewhere.

77
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,240
We’ll run into him sooner or later.

78
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:01,319
That’s true, but...

79
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,879
Life feels pointless right now.

80
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:04,839
Alright.

81
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:06,199
What’s even interesting to do?

82
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,959
Isn’t this all we can do now?

83
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:12,279
Yeah.

84
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,120
When you’ve got nothing to do,

85
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:16,360
go out and walk around more.

86
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:18,040
Maybe you’ll run into someone.

87
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,480
Around Songlin Town,

88
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,639
our comrades in hiding.

89
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:23,040
Alright, I’ll listen to you.

90
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,480
The wine you bought—

91
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,040
It’s barely enough for anyone.

92
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,160
Not even enough for me to drink alone.

93
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,120
Da Kuozhi gave it to me.

94
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:34,759
If he’s giving, he should give more. So stingy.

95
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,360
As long as there’s something to drink, it’s fine.

96
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:37,920
Why are you begging for food?

97
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,120
And you’re picky about it too.

98
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:40,759
If you drink, you should drink properly.

99
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:41,680
Otherwise, it’s no fun.

100
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:44,959
Alright.

101
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:47,959
Finish it off.

102
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,319
Water’s here.

103
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,279
Master.

104
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,120
Good.

105
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:24,519
Xiaogui,

106
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:26,839
You’ve pickled so many salted duck eggs.

107
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:27,720
We’ll be eating these

108
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,879
for ages.

109
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,079
Just eat them slowly.

110
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,040
Dad,

111
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,720
I’m saving money for you.

112
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:35,199
That’s a new one to me.

113
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,360
How does pickling duck eggs save money?

114
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:39,360
Dad,

115
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,199
Come here.

116
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,439
Listen to me.

117
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,319
Fresh duck eggs are bland.

118
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,480
Eat one per meal, it’s nothing special.

119
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,519
But once they’re salted,

120
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,839
they last longer.

121
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,759
One per meal is enough.

122
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,399
And they taste great.

123
00:06:59,439 --> 00:06:59,959
But why should I

124
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:01,199
give them duck eggs?

125
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,439
Dad, come on.

126
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,879
They train every day, it’s exhausting.

127
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,920
You need to be healthy to fight tough battles.

128
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,759
You always have a point.

129
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,560
Dad, ever since

130
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,600
we recruited people,

131
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:15,360
have the bandits ever come?

132
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:16,720
Would they even dare?

133
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:18,800
That’s the truth.

134
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,639
With me here,

135
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,600
not a single feather will go missing from our house.

136
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,000
Alright then.

137
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:27,920
You’ve learned a lot these past years outside.

138
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:29,279
Not bad.

139
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:30,879
You’ve made something of yourself.

140
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:32,279
Alright.

141
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,680
Just do what’s right.

142
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:35,040
Go ahead and pickle them.

143
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:36,319
I’ll go check over there.

144
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,000
Hua'er

145
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:14,040
What's wrong?

146
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,879
Why do you keep looking at me?

147
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,399
If you weren't looking at me,

148
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:20,680
how would you know I'm looking at you?

149
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,079
You...

150
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,399
It's such a small room.

151
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,360
It's pitch dark in here.

152
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,199
If I don't look at my wife,

153
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,360
who else would I look at?

154
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,080
Master

155
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:45,440
Back then,

156
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,240
did you really join the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army?

157
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,399
Of course I did.

158
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,399
I told you already.

159
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:50,480
How could that be fake?

160
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:53,919
What year did you fight the Japanese invaders?

161
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,080
That was years ago.

162
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,200
It must have been

163
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,519
the 21st year of the Republic.

164
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,759
When the Japanese invaders reached our area.

165
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,919
Why did you stop fighting later?

166
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,159
We couldn't beat them.

167
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,360
Those Japanese invaders,

168
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,720
they had money and guns.

169
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,039
Some groups,

170
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,720
just to survive,

171
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,879
even became puppet army against their conscience.

172
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:32,960
Take our village for example,

173
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,919
these brothers here,

174
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:36,120
who doesn't want to fight the Japanese?

175
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:42,320
They all have the will,

176
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,000
but not the strength.

177
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,200
If everyone thinks they're not capable,

178
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,399
and doesn't want to try,

179
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,519
the Japanese invaders will never be driven out.

180
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:03,759
What's wrong?

181
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:06,679
It's so late at night,

182
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:09,039
why are you talking about this?

183
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,519
Let's go fight the Japanese invaders.

184
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:15,519
In our village,

185
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,159
who doesn't have a grudge against them?

186
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,720
Let's join the army together.

187
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,559
You've fought landlords and bullies,

188
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:26,919
why be afraid of the Japanese invaders?

189
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:28,080
That's not the same.

190
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,799
If we go fight them now,

191
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:41,879
we might never come back.

192
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:44,759
They have men and guns.

193
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,120
Watching the people suffer,

194
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:46,840
can you stand it?

195
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,679
Can you bear it?

196
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,200
If I can't bear it, what can I do?

197
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,279
On my shoulders,

198
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,320
I only carry my own head.

199
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:55,000
The brothers in our village,

200
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,639
they follow me

201
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:57,200
for what reason?

202
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:59,840
Just to live a peaceful life.

203
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,080
And have food to eat.

204
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:08,080
If you say

205
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:10,240
I really go fight the Japanese invaders now,

206
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,519
what if something happens to me?

207
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,519
What will you do?

208
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,639
What about the child you're carrying?

209
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,200
If you go fight the Japanese invaders,

210
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:23,720
I'll go with you.

211
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,519
Let me think about it.

212
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,360
Why are you here?

213
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,799
The wine... the wine's all gone.

214
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:08,480
Where's the wine?

215
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:10,159
Wine.

216
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,039
The blockhead finally opened up.

217
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,879
Who are you to me?

218
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:25,480
You're not mine.

219
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,600
Why did you come here?

220
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,600
We've been together for half a year.

221
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:00,080
Where did you come from?

222
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,519
What do you really do?

223
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:05,200
I've never figured you out.

224
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,799
You don't tell me,

225
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,080
and I don't ask.

226
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:14,480
Even if you

227
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,080
came out of a crack in a rock,

228
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:18,679
I wouldn't care.

229
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,960
I care about you as a person.

230
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:30,720
What kind of person am I,

231
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:33,600
you see clearly.

232
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:37,000
What I'm thinking,

233
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,000
you understand well.

234
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:55,919
Let me ask you one thing.

235
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,080
Do you really care about me?

236
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,279
I do.

237
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:14,200
Then why don't you say it?

238
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:31,559
Songlin Town can't keep you.

239
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:37,320
Can I keep you?

240
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,360
Give me a straight answer.

241
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:14,279
Forget it.

242
00:15:17,799 --> 00:15:18,440
Just go.

243
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,759
I'll do as you say.

244
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,240
If you don't want me to leave,

245
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:34,679
then I won't go.

246
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:14,039
Try sister-in-law's cooking.

247
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,799
Oh wow.

248
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,319
It smells amazing.

249
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:18,720
Big brother is really lucky.

250
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,079
Smells good, right?

251
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:22,240
It's not just about the food.

252
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:23,960
Since sister-in-law arrived,

253
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,720
he's enjoyed every blessing.

254
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,359
That's for sure.

255
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:28,400
Which brother on the mountain

256
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,319
hasn't benefited from it?

257
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,279
Come on.

258
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:32,519
Second brother.

259
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,480
Pass me the wine.

260
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:40,599
Sister-in-law.

261
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,559
You know,

262
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:45,240
I'm not good with words.

263
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,640
But I still want to say,

264
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:48,880
thank you for saving my life.

265
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:49,799
I toast to you.

266
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:51,319
Why bring this up again?

267
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,400
Are you done yet?

268
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,599
Then I won't say anything.

269
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,839
I'll just drink, okay?

270
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:57,880
I can't drink alcohol right now.

271
00:18:58,519 --> 00:18:59,480
I'll use water instead.

272
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,359
Come on.

273
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,200
Let's drink.

274
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:02,440
Here, thank you, sister-in-law.

275
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:03,359
I'll finish it.

276
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,319
Sister-in-law.

277
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,920
Since we're talking about it,

278
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:12,759
I'll toast to you too.

279
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:15,079
We're all family here.

280
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,960
All these toasts feel too formal.

281
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:18,440
I'll drink first.

282
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:26,319
Sister-in-law.

283
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,640
Let me speak from the heart.

284
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,000
Whenever the brothers talk about you,

285
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,480
they're extremely envious.

286
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,440
That's true.

287
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,480
Sister-in-law.

288
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:35,839
All the brothers in the village

289
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,599
feel the same way about you.

290
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,720
You're all putting me on a pedestal.

291
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,039
It's not just flattery.

292
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:41,720
Sister-in-law.

293
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,799
You've truly earned it.

294
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,319
You care about all of us.

295
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:48,240
Second brother.

296
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:49,599
For what you just said,

297
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:51,480
let's toast to sister-in-law again.

298
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,519
No need for more toasts.

299
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:53,720
It's too formal.

300
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,400
If sister-in-law says no, then no.

301
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,559
Then just say I'm craving wine, okay?

302
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:58,480
Is that alright, sister-in-law?

303
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,000
Alright.

304
00:19:59,119 --> 00:19:59,960
After all this talk,

305
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:00,680
it's you guys

306
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,000
who never treat me as an outsider.

307
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,359
Come on.

308
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:03,079
Come on.

309
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:03,680
We're family.

310
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:04,519
One heart.

311
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,039
One heart, one heart.

312
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:06,680
Cheers.

313
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:16,640
Be careful.

314
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,279
The three in front,

315
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,119
kneeling position.

316
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,480
That's right.

317
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,599
Aim.

318
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:24,559
Lower this hand a bit.

319
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,079
Don't grip with this hand.

320
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,000
Understand?

321
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,279
Push, then pull.

322
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:30,079
Press down.

323
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,279
Got it?

324
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:32,799
Fix your sling.

325
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:33,680
Switch.

326
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,160
This tastes good.

327
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:41,720
This goes best with wine.

328
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,000
Second brother, third brother.

329
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:48,920
Let me say something.

330
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:54,039
Go ahead, sister-in-law.

331
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,279
I know your backgrounds.

332
00:20:59,160 --> 00:20:59,799
As for me,

333
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:01,960
you've probably heard about it.

334
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,920
My mother was killed by the Japanese invaders.

335
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,519
Your mothers

336
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,279
were also killed by the Japanese invaders.

337
00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:11,640
We share the same fate.

338
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,519
Today,

339
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,559
with this good food and wine,

340
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,319
let's toast to our mothers together.

341
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:20,279
Is that alright?

342
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:21,799
Alright.

343
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:27,400
Mother,

344
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,680
I offer you a cup of wine.

345
00:21:31,319 --> 00:21:33,559
You suffered all your life and couldn't find peace.

346
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,519
It's all because of those Japanese invaders.

347
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:37,359
They destroyed our family.

348
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,079
These two men at the table,

349
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,680
their mothers

350
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,480
were also killed by the Japanese invaders.

351
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:45,359
They are filled with hatred too.

352
00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:47,200
They also want to avenge their mothers.

353
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,200
Am I right?

354
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,599
That's right.

355
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,160
Yes.

356
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,799
If we don't take revenge,

357
00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:54,960
our mothers won't rest in peace.

358
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,519
As their children,

359
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,440
we can't face our elders back home.

360
00:21:58,559 --> 00:21:59,960
We can't face our mothers either.

361
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:02,680
Mother,

362
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:04,559
this cup of wine,

363
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,839
please accept it.

364
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,480
I promise to keep my word.

365
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:08,839
I will avenge you.

366
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,799
Second brother, third brother,

367
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,039
you always say

368
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,279
that sister-in-law is good.

369
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,240
You want to thank me.

370
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,359
I don't need your thanks.

371
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:25,440
I just hope we can

372
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:27,519
avenge our mothers' deep hatred together.

373
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,440
To comfort their souls in heaven.

374
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,200
Well...

375
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,319
What's wrong?

376
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:35,920
Are you afraid?

377
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:38,039
Are you still men or not?

378
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,799
Sister-in-law,

379
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,200
I hate those Japanese invaders.

380
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,599
I hate them so much it hurts.

381
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:46,160
But we only have a few brothers here.

382
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,680
Going up against them is like an egg hitting a rock.

383
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,920
If everyone thinks like that,

384
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,240
we'll never get our revenge.

385
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:52,720
Then it's pointless for us to go.

386
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,119
A single drop of water is light.

387
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,480
But if you gather enough,

388
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:56,480
it becomes a river.

389
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,519
It becomes the sea.

390
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,359
Sister-in-law,

391
00:22:58,559 --> 00:22:59,759
we understand all this.

392
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,279
Even if it's just the two of us,

393
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,720
we've made up our minds.

394
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,440
But what about big brother?

395
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:06,240
I asked him.

396
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,960
He hesitated.

397
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:13,000
Second brother, third brother,

398
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,119
just one question:

399
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,519
Can you go fight the Japanese invaders with me?

400
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,279
Can you let our mothers rest in peace?

401
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:20,160
Yes.

402
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,640
Me too.

403
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:22,799
Alright.

404
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:24,720
Second brother, pour the wine.

405
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,359
Let's toast loudly.

406
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,440
It's settled.

407
00:23:30,759 --> 00:23:31,240
Sister-in-law,

408
00:23:32,359 --> 00:23:32,960
It's settled.

409
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:33,920
It's settled.

410
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,039
Come on.

411
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,480
Sit down and keep eating.

412
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,319
Keep drinking.

413
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:44,880
Second brother,

414
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,319
Come, have some food.

415
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,519
Sister-in-law,

416
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,400
What about big brother?

417
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,039
He'll go his own way.

418
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:57,440
We'll follow our own path.

419
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,720
So, sister-in-law,

420
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:00,039
big brother doesn't tolerate

421
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:01,319
even a grain of sand.

422
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:05,440
Tie him up.

423
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,400
Lao Tang

424
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:27,680
Why did you come back?

425
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,759
Stick with me in a bit.

426
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,160
We'll rush out together.

427
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,759
We can't just leave them behind.

428
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,119
I can't handle that much.

429
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,319
So many lives at stake.

430
00:26:39,319 --> 00:26:40,880
They're all gone.

431
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,039
Fu Qing

432
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:13,640
You scared me to death.

433
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:24,200
Xiao Gui, Yun Hu, Hua'er

434
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:25,359
Platoon Leader

435
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,599
Wait for me.

436
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,200
Forgot.

437
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,200
Master

438
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,440
Master

439
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,160
Master

440
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:29,839
Something's wrong, something big happened!

441
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,640
What's going on? Why are you so frantic?

442
00:28:34,039 --> 00:28:34,599
Master

443
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,160
Young master and the guards

444
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:37,160
are nowhere to be found.

445
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:39,000
They must have gone for training again.

446
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:39,920
No.

447
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:41,720
Look.

448
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,319
This is a letter the young master left for you.

449
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:44,519
And I checked,

450
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,000
the guards' bedding is all gone.

451
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:49,119
All the jars of salted duck eggs at home

452
00:28:49,319 --> 00:28:50,680
have been taken too.

453
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,440
Father,

454
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,039
by the time you read this letter,

455
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:00,519
I will already be gone.

456
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:02,480
Not just me,

457
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,200
I've taken the guards and the guns

458
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,279
with me as well.

459
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:06,799
If you've read this far,

460
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:08,039
you must understand everything.

461
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,440
But father,

462
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,279
I really had no other choice.

463
00:29:11,319 --> 00:29:12,359
I can only let you down.

464
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,400
But you're my father, after all.

465
00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:16,880
Father,

466
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:19,119
I know you care about me.

467
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,440
You want me to live a safe and peaceful life.

468
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:22,839
Everything is packed.

469
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,559
All packed.

470
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:24,640
But the Japanese invaders are here.

471
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,119
Let's go.

472
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:26,680
Ordinary people can't live in peace.

473
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,480
The Japanese invaders haven't touched our family

474
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:29,440
not because they're kind-hearted,

475
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:30,880
and certainly not because they pity us.

476
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,240
They just want

477
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,720
to fatten the pig before slaughtering it.

478
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:35,680
As long as the Japanese invaders are here,

479
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:37,920
we'll face the knife sooner or later.

480
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,400
Father,

481
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,799
I'm sorry to let you down.

482
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:42,960
When I win the battle,

483
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:44,079
I'll come back and honor you.

484
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,519
Father,

485
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,119
Years ago, your son gave up his studies to join the army.

486
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,079
I went to war with passion in my heart.

487
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:52,079
I've never regretted it to this day.

488
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,519
My blood still burns with passion.

489
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,599
A good man defends his home and country.

490
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:56,960
That's an ancient teaching.

491
00:29:58,119 --> 00:29:59,319
As a descendant of the Lao Tian family,

492
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,160
I must bring honor to our ancestors.

493
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:02,880
And bring honor to you.

494
00:30:04,599 --> 00:30:05,160
Father,

495
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:06,480
Please don't be angry.

496
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:07,920
Take care of yourself.

497
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,440
Wait for my return.

498
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,359
Wait for your son to honor you.

499
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,599
Master

500
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:26,799
The meal is ready.

501
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,160
I put it in your room.

502
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,359
Eat it later.

503
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:31,640
Just leave it there for now.

504
00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:32,839
Master

505
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,000
The young master left but he'll be back.

506
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:36,839
You need to take care of your health.

507
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:42,480
Is Old Tian at home?

508
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,200
The village chief is here.

509
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:44,960
I'll go take a look.

510
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,559
The village chief is here.

511
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:55,039
Where's Xiao Gui?

512
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:57,240
Haven't seen him for days.

513
00:31:57,799 --> 00:31:58,640
Don't mention it.

514
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:04,880
Something must have happened.

515
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:08,599
Where's the gunner?

516
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,960
The gunner ran off.

517
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:10,720
What about the gun?

518
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:12,599
The gunner took the gun and ran.

519
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:13,559
Where's Xiao Gui?

520
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:14,279
Xiao Gui

521
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:15,720
Went to Harbin.

522
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,920
Said he went to find a classmate, right?

523
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,720
This is serious.

524
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:29,240
Your Xiao Gui went to Harbin,

525
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:32,240
and those gunners took the guns and ran.

526
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:35,240
That's really not the same thing.

527
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:37,240
It's really not the same thing.

528
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:38,759
Really.

529
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:44,799
Headman

530
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,400
All drawn from the well

531
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:51,000
Cool off a bit

532
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:52,119
It's fine

533
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:55,079
Everyone's registered and accounted for

534
00:32:55,759 --> 00:32:56,519
None of them can escape

535
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:58,079
They can't run

536
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,039
They're all carrying

537
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:01,279
They ran off with guns

538
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:02,880
How could they dare come home?

539
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,319
If they come home

540
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:06,440
A lot of people would get dragged in

541
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,400
You're absolutely right

542
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,160
Not just his family

543
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,160
Even you by then

544
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:14,839
Me?

545
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:16,480
I understand

546
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:18,279
Stay with the headman

547
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:19,519
Master

548
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:21,000
Where are you going?

549
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,960
Changshun, tell us

550
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,839
What's really going on here?

551
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:30,920
Headman

552
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:33,759
You know exactly what's happening

553
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:36,559
Recently, bandits hit our home

554
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:37,799
The young master

555
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:38,839
Was focused on protecting the family

556
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,960
He advised the master to recruit men

557
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:42,440
Who would've thought

558
00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:44,119
Two troublemakers showed up

559
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,400
They stirred things up inside and out

560
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,119
Took both people and guns away

561
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,720
The young master was humiliated

562
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:52,680
The master said a few more words

563
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:55,319
So he left in a huff

564
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,680
Said he was going to

565
00:33:56,759 --> 00:33:58,119
Harbin to have a look

566
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,519
To see if he could make it there

567
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,519
So tell me

568
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:04,640
Where could those people have gone?

569
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:06,319
I reckon

570
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,519
They went up the mountain to be bandits

571
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,440
Not to join the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army?

572
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,960
No way

573
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,639
The troops are searching the mountains everywhere

574
00:34:16,039 --> 00:34:17,480
They're arresting Anti-Japanese fighters in the village every day

575
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,880
They're not stupid

576
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,679
Master, Headman

577
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:25,679
You two keep talking

578
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,000
Don't just sit there, here, eat

579
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,639
I just heard from the steward

580
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,119
Xiaogui left with you out of spite

581
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,360
That's right

582
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:42,400
I called him a wastrel

583
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:44,079
I said it harshly

584
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:45,599
I'm getting muddled in my old age

585
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:46,760
Tell me

586
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:48,880
Was that too harsh?

587
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:52,199
Isn't that just being a wastrel?

588
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:55,159
Being a wastrel is a small thing

589
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,280
Peace is a big deal

590
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,760
About this matter

591
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,079
If it really blows up

592
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,400
It'll drag in

593
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,239
Dozens of families around here

594
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,199
Our Tian family

595
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:05,679
In the future at Yimianslope

596
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,480
How could we hold our heads up?

597
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,400
We might not even be able to stay here

598
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:11,719
Don't you think so?

599
00:35:13,159 --> 00:35:13,800
Headman

600
00:35:14,039 --> 00:35:15,559
You're generous and understanding

601
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:17,519
Please think of a way

602
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,480
Can you turn a big problem into a small one

603
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,280
And a small one into nothing?

604
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:29,159
Speaking of your Xiaogui

605
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,000
Not only is he a wastrel

606
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:32,880
He's got a wild heart too

607
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,800
He doesn't want to come home, does he?

608
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:36,800
Alright

609
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:38,159
It's better that he left

610
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,760
But if he comes back

611
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,119
Don't hide him

612
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,079
Let me know

613
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:46,519
I need to question him face to face

614
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:48,000
I'll listen to the headman

615
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:50,159
It's settled then

616
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,400
If he comes back

617
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,480
Report to me immediately

618
00:35:53,079 --> 00:35:54,079
If I don't get to the bottom of it

619
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:55,639
Every last detail

620
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,360
This matter won't be over

621
00:36:17,159 --> 00:36:18,800
As long as the flame of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army burns,

622
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,400
China will never fall.

623
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,920
The Japanese invaders right in front of us are vicious.

624
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:26,880
They attack us like rabid dogs.

625
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,119
But can we back down?

626
00:36:29,719 --> 00:36:30,760
We can't.

627
00:36:31,719 --> 00:36:33,000
This is our country.

628
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:34,599
Our land.

629
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,400
If we don't defend it,

630
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,880
who will?

631
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:21,239
Nine

632
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,599
Lao Tang

633
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:25,960
Lao Tang

634
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,480
Squad Leader Two

635
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,280
You see, Lao Tang even carved his name.

636
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,599
So why can't we find him?

637
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,280
Don't worry yet.

638
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:04,159
Maybe he's still on his way.

639
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:05,480
Something might have held him up.

640
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,320
Looking at his carving,

641
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:08,960
it's freshly made.

642
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:10,079
It was just

643
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:10,800
a blink of an eye ago.

644
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:11,639
I've already come back.

645
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,119
We should've seen him by now.

646
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,119
Yeah.

647
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:18,719
Do you think Lao Tang

648
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:20,320
could've been caught on his way to Songlin Town?

649
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,280
Maybe he got arrested?

650
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,639
Can't you hope for something better for him?

651
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,199
Songlin Town is tiny.

652
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,760
If anything happened,

653
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,599
wouldn't we know?

654
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:36,079
So what's going on then?

655
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,320
It must be.

656
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,719
We think this is the main street,

657
00:38:41,159 --> 00:38:42,239
but he doesn't know that.

658
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:44,679
Maybe when he got to Songlin Town,

659
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,239
he wandered off into some corner.

660
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:47,159
Right?

661
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,039
And we're still here,

662
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:49,199
like fools waiting for nothing.

663
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:50,320
We won't find him this way.

664
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,239
Yeah, you're right, makes sense.

665
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,400
Lao Tang doesn't know this place.

666
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:54,079
Here's what we'll do.

667
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:54,760
Let's split up and look for him.

668
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,440
Yeah, good idea.

669
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:28,119
Fuqing

670
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,159
Yunhu

671
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:32,920
Deyuan

672
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,039
Fuqing, Yunhu, Deyuan

673
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,039
From the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army.

674
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,599
He's wounded.

675
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:40,239
Search for him. He can't escape.

676
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:54,599
Take this.

677
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:55,519
There's food inside.

678
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:56,960
Hide yourself well.

679
00:42:06,199 --> 00:42:06,760
Where is he?

680
00:42:08,599 --> 00:42:09,039
Chase him.

681
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:14,039
Don't move.

682
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,159
You run pretty fast.

683
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,639
O-officer.

684
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,239
What does this mean?

685
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,360
What are you doing?

686
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,360
What do you do?

687
00:42:30,039 --> 00:42:30,719
Me?

688
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,159
I'm just passing by.

689
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:34,519
Just passing by.

690
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:35,440
Where are you going?

691
00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:37,840
Mudanjiang.

692
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:39,039
Visiting relatives.

693
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,559
Mudanjiang.

694
00:42:43,239 --> 00:42:43,800
Officer.

695
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,079
It wasn't him just now.

696
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:47,920
It's not him.

697
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:48,920
Who is it?

698
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:53,760
What do you mean, not him?

699
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:54,960
It's him.

700
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:56,039
Take him away.

701
00:42:56,239 --> 00:42:56,760
What is this?

702
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,360
Why me?

703
00:42:58,960 --> 00:42:59,519
Officer.

704
00:42:59,559 --> 00:43:01,199
I'm a good citizen, officer.

705
00:43:02,039 --> 00:43:02,599
Officer.
