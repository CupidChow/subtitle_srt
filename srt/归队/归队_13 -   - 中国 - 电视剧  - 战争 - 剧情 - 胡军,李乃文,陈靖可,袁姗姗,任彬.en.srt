1
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,199
Buddy

2
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:26,840
Please wait a moment.

3
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:31,680
Brother

4
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:32,960
Brother

5
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,319
The brother with the backpack

6
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:36,639
Wait

7
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,240
Someone brought you a bowl of noodles.

8
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:43,919
Where is he?

9
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:44,840
He left.

10
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,040
I wonder how things are at Bakematsu.

11
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,240
How are the old squad leader and the others?

12
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:45,839
Are they doing okay?

13
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,360
Come here.

14
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:50,480
Come over.

15
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,199
Are you eating or not?

16
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,759
Are you going to eat?

17
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:12,079
Second Brother is busy.

18
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,040
Sis.

19
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:15,600
You shouldn't be doing this work.

20
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:16,319
Sis, Sis.

21
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:17,639
Big Brother said

22
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,240
he brought you here to enjoy life.

23
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:19,920
Not to make you

24
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:20,959
suffer here.

25
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,800
This is our home.

26
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,800
Working for your own family isn't suffering.

27
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:26,639
Come.

28
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,800
Big Brother isn't home today.

29
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:30,879
Sis, if you need anything, just tell me.

30
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,920
We've got food and drink.

31
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:34,160
What could go wrong?

32
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:36,839
That's true.

33
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,480
Second Brother.

34
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:44,839
You three brothers

35
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:45,920
seem really close.

36
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,639
How did you all meet?

37
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,639
That's a long story.

38
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,000
Like the 108 heroes of Liangshan,

39
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:55,680
everyone has a story before joining.

40
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,720
We're the same.

41
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,680
Nothing to do anyway.

42
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,439
Let me tell you, Sis.

43
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,360
Go ahead.

44
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,480
As for me,

45
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,000
My father died early.

46
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:20,160
It was just me and my mother.

47
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,879
One day,

48
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:23,920
my mother and I

49
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:25,040
went to the market in town.

50
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,120
A Jap soldier harassed my mother.

51
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:29,519
My mother was tough.

52
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,800
She'd rather die than give in.

53
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,519
Then

54
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:38,879
he hit her with a rifle butt

55
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,319
and smashed her head.

56
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:43,000
I kept watching that Jap

57
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,839
for days.

58
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:46,040
I even knew where he went to the toilet.

59
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,360
I had it all figured out.

60
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:49,680
One day he went to the outhouse.

61
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:52,160
I stabbed him in the throat.

62
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:54,040
Cut off his head.

63
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,759
Wrapped it in cloth.

64
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:56,600
Tied it to my belt.

65
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:58,399
I thought

66
00:06:58,439 --> 00:06:59,720
I'd use his head to honor my mother.

67
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,040
But it didn't go as planned.

68
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,759
The Japs found out.

69
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,040
They chased me everywhere.

70
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,120
I had no choice

71
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,959
but to run into Congshan.

72
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:12,519
Sis,

73
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:14,319
do you know what Big Brother said

74
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:15,519
when he first met me?

75
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:16,920
What did he say?

76
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,720
"Have you killed anyone?"

77
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,439
I didn't say a word.

78
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:21,519
I threw the Jap's head

79
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,519
right at him.

80
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,920
The boss caught the head.

81
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,040
He shouted,

82
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:27,120
"You're tough!"

83
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:31,319
So I stayed in Congshan.

84
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,680
I guess

85
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,360
because I killed

86
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,639
a Jap,

87
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:38,199
they made me second-in-command.

88
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,240
If there were no Japs,

89
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,000
your mother wouldn't have died.

90
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,519
That's right.

91
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:47,360
I hate them so much.

92
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,360
Didn't you ever think

93
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:50,639
about killing more Japs?

94
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,879
Of course.

95
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,759
But...

96
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,759
I don't have the skills.

97
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,120
The old saying is true.

98
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,240
Under a low roof,

99
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,120
you have to bow your head.

100
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,360
Even if you bow,

101
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,839
they won't pity you.

102
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,519
The more you bow, the more they bully you.

103
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:13,920
Sis,

104
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,079
when will the Japs finally leave?

105
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:30,680
Stop right there.

106
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,639
Here you are again, asking for food and drink.

107
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:33,360
Go on, get out.

108
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,279
Our food

109
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,320
doesn't just fall from the sky.

110
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:38,080
I—I'm

111
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,320
here for the first time.

112
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,320
I didn't ask you for anything.

113
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,440
Then what are you here for?

114
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,639
Looking for someone.

115
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:44,639
Who are you looking for?

116
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,440
Is this Tian Xiaogui's house?

117
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:48,639
You know our young master?

118
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:49,720
Yes, I do.

119
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,039
Go, go, tell him

120
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,720
his uncle is here to see him.

121
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,240
Uncle?

122
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:56,919
Wait here.

123
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:19,559
Who's his uncle?

124
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:20,919
I am.

125
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,759
You really lie without blinking.

126
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,360
I watched Xiaogui grow up.

127
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,000
He doesn't have an uncle like you.

128
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:31,559
Go on, get out.

129
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:32,960
I really am his uncle.

130
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Just tell him, please.

131
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,480
If you don't leave, I'll get rough.

132
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:37,799
What, you want to hit me?

133
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:39,039
What? What?

134
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:40,519
Someone, come here!

135
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:43,600
Tian Xiaogui!

136
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:45,279
Your uncle is here to see you.

137
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:45,960
Shut up.

138
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,279
Prepare food and drinks for your uncle.

139
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,440
Big chicken drumsticks.

140
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,559
Braised pork knuckle, pig's feet.

141
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:51,799
Don't leave anything out.

142
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:52,600
Uncle.

143
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,039
Tian Xiaogui.

144
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:55,159
Xiaogui.

145
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:56,399
What are you doing?

146
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:57,919
What are you doing?

147
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:01,960
Xiaogui.

148
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:03,080
Uncle.

149
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:08,480
You've put on some weight.

150
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:09,360
That's great.

151
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,360
Uncle.

152
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:13,120
Where did you come from?

153
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,360
Can we have something to eat

154
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:17,399
and then chat?

155
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:18,279
Alright.

156
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:19,960
Hurry and stew a chicken.

157
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,360
And steam a pot of big buns.

158
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:23,159
Quick.

159
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,399
It's not easy.

160
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:26,960
This way.

161
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,879
Uncle, let me.

162
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,279
Uncle.

163
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,440
Your hair—

164
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:34,600
I almost didn't recognize you.

165
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,399
Your aunt did that.

166
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:37,759
My aunt really knows how to cut hair.

167
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:39,639
Who cut your hair?

168
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,639
Looks stylish.

169
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:41,960
Come on, come on.

170
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:54,960
How is it, Uncle?

171
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,320
It's good.

172
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:57,679
Good.

173
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:58,960
Tell me,

174
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:00,039
your family really is

175
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,000
a big household.

176
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:03,120
Tell me,

177
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,240
how did you have the heart

178
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:07,320
to leave this home back then?

179
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:08,679
You were stubborn.

180
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,639
You know how stubborn I am, Uncle.

181
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:13,360
I'll go get some food.

182
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:15,720
Not right now.

183
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,000
I'll pour you some water.

184
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,039
Young master.

185
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:30,080
The master wants to see you.

186
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,879
Uncle, I'll be right back.

187
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:46,639
Son,

188
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,639
You've already lived with passion.

189
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,080
You've tasted life's ups and downs.

190
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,159
You've been through it all.

191
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,320
Settle down now.

192
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,080
Listen to your father.

193
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:56,879
Don't go anywhere else.

194
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,879
Stay home and help me.

195
00:11:57,879 --> 00:11:59,200
Take care of our family business.

196
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:01,399
I'll find you a good wife.

197
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,559
Start a family.

198
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:03,799
Relax on the bed whenever you want.

199
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:05,039
Eat whatever you like.

200
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:05,600
Isn't that great?

201
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,360
I don't ask for much.

202
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:09,279
We just need to live well.

203
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,600
Keep the Tian family line going.

204
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,799
Pass it on to the next generation.

205
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:15,320
Dad,

206
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,639
Do you really think under the Japanese

207
00:12:18,039 --> 00:12:19,399
we can live in peace?

208
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,799
Aren't we living just fine now?

209
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,240
Just take it one day at a time.

210
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,080
Worry about the next meal when it comes.

211
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,080
As for the future,

212
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:27,000
no one can say for sure.

213
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,320
How can you not know?

214
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:29,960
If the Japanese don't leave,

215
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,799
we have no future.

216
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,039
Wait, what are you doing?

217
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:33,960
What are you doing?

218
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,399
Not listening to your father?

219
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,200
Saying those things in front of your mother?

220
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,320
Are you lying to her?

221
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,440
Let me tell you,

222
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,240
Tian Xiaogui,

223
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,559
You better stop now.

224
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:43,799
The things you've done,

225
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,360
if the Japanese find out,

226
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,200
none of us will survive.

227
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:48,879
They'll even dig up our ancestors' graves.

228
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,600
If that happens, I'm telling you,

229
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:51,720
you'll be the Tian family's

230
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:52,879
biggest sinner.

231
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:55,240
What are you looking at?

232
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,399
What's your problem?

233
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,799
You want your father to kneel to you?

234
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:26,600
Uncle,

235
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,279
Try this.

236
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:01,240
Smells great.

237
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:02,799
This is good stuff.

238
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,120
You get it.

239
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,799
Looking at you now,

240
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,200
all chubby and healthy,

241
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,120
I almost feel bad taking you away.

242
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:15,639
Uncle,

243
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,679
what do you mean by that?

244
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,600
What did your dad want just now?

245
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:23,480
Nothing much.

246
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:25,320
He just likes to nag.

247
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:33,000
I was thinking,

248
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,720
don’t rush.

249
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:37,919
Take care of things at home

250
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,639
before you decide anything.

251
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:44,960
Uncle,

252
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:45,879
how about this—

253
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,039
give me three days.

254
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,000
Is that okay?

255
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:49,679
Alright.

256
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,279
Alright.

257
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:52,120
I’ll arrange a place for you to stay.

258
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:52,840
Wait.

259
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:56,000
I’m not from your family.

260
00:14:57,039 --> 00:14:57,960
I stand out too much.

261
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:00,120
I can’t bring trouble to your family.

262
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,159
Don’t want to cause problems.

263
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,519
I’ve got a place, don’t worry.

264
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,399
Then I’ll bring you food every day.

265
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:11,919
Just help me with this meal first,

266
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,879
can you do that?

267
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:16,600
Hurry up.

268
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,399
Alright.

269
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:18,039
Darn it.

270
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,360
You’re going in circles

271
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,480
trying to avoid me.

272
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:38,279
It’s not far, just nearby.

273
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:40,000
You can see it if you look up.

274
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,840
I’ve already found a place to stay.

275
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:46,200
That day,

276
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,639
when I brought back the wine,

277
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:48,759
right on our street,

278
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:49,559
there’s a shop.

279
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,600
It’s about to change owners.

280
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:52,120
I thought the location was good,

281
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,440
so I asked about the price.

282
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,159
It’s not expensive to take over.

283
00:15:55,559 --> 00:15:56,440
I think it’s pretty good.

284
00:15:56,559 --> 00:15:57,519
What do you want to do with it?

285
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:00,879
Songlin Town is by the mountains.

286
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,720
So I’ll live off the land.

287
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:04,600
I want to open a shop selling mountain goods.

288
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,639
What do you think?

289
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:09,639
I owe you.

290
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,279
Don’t say that.

291
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,200
That’s too distant.

292
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,799
It’s just—

293
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,279
I feel guilty always getting the better deal.

294
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:29,720
If we were outside,

295
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,279
with others around,

296
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,759
I’d really feel uneasy.

297
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:38,799
I’m not worried, why are you?

298
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:41,399
Is that okay?

299
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,799
A grown man

300
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,639
has to hold up his own.

301
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,039
I didn’t misjudge you.

302
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,559
I know.

303
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,720
A man’s pride

304
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,200
is worth more than his life.

305
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,680
What are you doing?

306
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,680
Not busy?

307
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,480
Busy, busy.

308
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,920
That Liu Heihu—

309
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:37,599
I’ll skin him alive one day.

310
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,400
What happened?

311
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:40,759
What else?

312
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:41,880
Big brother’s back.

313
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:43,160
I was thinking today

314
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,599
I’d settle things with Liu Heihu.

315
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:46,119
That bastard

316
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:47,200
tried to trick me.

317
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:48,400
He ambushed me.

318
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:51,119
If I hadn’t reacted fast today,

319
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:52,960
my men would’ve all died there.

320
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,599
Brother, are you alright?

321
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,359
I’m fine. Let’s go.

322
00:17:57,079 --> 00:17:58,039
Are you okay?

323
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,079
Liu Heihu bit me.

324
00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:08,240
Liu Heihu bit you?

325
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:10,599
What happened?

326
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,160
When I was running, that dog caught up.

327
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,200
Bit me on the butt.

328
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,559
What’s with that dog?

329
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:23,039
Let’s go.

330
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:24,240
Let’s get you some medicine inside.

331
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:29,720
How is it?

332
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:33,240
Why are you laughing?

333
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:36,720
Hua’er,

334
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,400
Be gentle.

335
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,359
Easy, easy.

336
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,160
Getting hurt in this spot...

337
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,200
Good thing it’s me.

338
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:52,200
If you had someone else treat it,

339
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,400
I’d feel

340
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,559
really uneasy.

341
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,319
You’re overthinking.

342
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,079
When fighting the Japanese,

343
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,240
even if your guts spill out,

344
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,880
you tie ’em up and shove them back in.

345
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,519
And keep fighting.

346
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,519
Listen, Hua’er,

347
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,680
me and Liu Heihu,

348
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,720
we’ve got a real grudge now.

349
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:07,880
He just has more guns, right?

350
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,759
Let me think it over.

351
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,680
I’ll take care of him.

352
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:13,519
Hua’er.

353
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:14,640
Hua’er.

354
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,400
What’s wrong, Hua’er?

355
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,119
Congratulations, Boss.

356
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:34,480
Your wife is pregnant.

357
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,319
Is it a boy?

358
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,319
Hard to say.

359
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:38,759
Tell me.

360
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,000
Can’t really tell.

361
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:41,680
No way to know.

362
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,240
I’ll feed you lead!

363
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:44,640
Boss.

364
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,640
I really don’t know.

365
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,200
Don’t make it hard for him.

366
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:49,039
Boy or girl,

367
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:50,160
it’s still your child.

368
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:51,480
True.

369
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,039
Wait, that’s not right.

370
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,000
What if it’s a girl?

371
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,359
I’d worry a lot.

372
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:01,559
Yeah.

373
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,519
What if bandits take her?

374
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:04,359
What would we do?

375
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:05,720
No, wait.

376
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:07,519
Depends on what kind of bandit.

377
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:08,200
Right?

378
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,039
If she finds one like her dad,

379
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,440
she’ll have a good life.

380
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,359
Right?

381
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,759
Yes, yes, yes.

382
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:15,480
You’re always right.

383
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:17,880
Alright.

384
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:19,039
Today’s a good day.

385
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:19,759
Stay tonight.

386
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:20,480
Have a couple drinks with me.

387
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:22,359
Thank you, Boss.

388
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,920
That’s great, Hua’er!

389
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,359
Hua’er, I’m going to be a dad!

390
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,160
Here they come.

391
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,039
Here they come again.

392
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:14,599
Xiaogui isn’t here.

393
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,119
Where did he go?

394
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:19,359
He went out.

395
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:22,480
When did he leave?

396
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,200
Yesterday.

397
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:26,480
Did he say when he’d be back?

398
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,559
No idea.

399
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,440
Alright, I’ve got things to do.

400
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:06,359
Stay alive.

401
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,200
Fight with all you've got to survive.

402
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,079
As long as we're alive, there's hope.

403
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:11,960
Our blood and passion

404
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,119
if spilled, should be spilled

405
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:15,400
on our homeland.

406
00:22:16,599 --> 00:22:17,640
As long as I, Laoshandong,

407
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,519
still have a breath left,

408
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,400
I'll lead everyone back to the unit.

409
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,559
What's going on?

410
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:49,720
Why is the door locked?

411
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,759
Young master, he's gone.

412
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,559
Uncle.

413
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:29,279
Xiaogui.

414
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,680
You really

415
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,079
are determined to come with me?

416
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,640
Uncle, why say that again?

417
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,960
Would I ever run away?

418
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,200
I have to rejoin the unit with you.

419
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,119
But you didn't bring anything.

420
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,839
What? Why?

421
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,319
Don't mention it.

422
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:48,960
My father locked me up.

423
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:50,200
I escaped.

424
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,400
No rush right now.

425
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,039
Don't fall out with your father.

426
00:23:58,039 --> 00:23:58,440
Uncle.

427
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,039
Good thing you came for me.

428
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,359
If I'd stayed a few more days,

429
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,079
this warm bed would have

430
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:03,759
made me soft.

431
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:09,160
Who doesn't want

432
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,599
an easy life?

433
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:13,920
But you got up from that warm bed,

434
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,519
stood up,

435
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:16,839
good for you.

436
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,160
Uncle.

437
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:21,599
It's rare for you to praise me.

438
00:24:21,799 --> 00:24:22,319
Is that so?

439
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,359
I'll keep that in mind.

440
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:24,839
Alright.

441
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,119
So,

442
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,839
should we go again

443
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,720
to Bakematsu?

444
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:36,680
Yeah.

445
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:40,200
If someone left a mark there,

446
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,559
we'll have to find them in Songlin Town.

447
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,799
So when do we gather the troops?

448
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:49,480
I'm thinking about that too.

449
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:54,240
Those guns your family has,

450
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:55,880
how did you get them?

451
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,880
My family

452
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,599
is a big local household.

453
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:01,640
When we wanted to buy guns,

454
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:02,640
those guys thought

455
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,680
we were defending against bandits.

456
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,039
They sold us the guns.

457
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:06,319
They made a good profit.

458
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,599
Now we've got money too.

459
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:12,880
Ask your father

460
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:15,359
to get us a few more guns.

461
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:18,960
He definitely won't agree.

462
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,559
He...

463
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:23,960
Yeah, that's true.

464
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:34,640
What are you laughing at?

465
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:36,599
Uncle.

466
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:39,160
I've got an idea.

467
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,000
What's happening?

468
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,880
We're under attack!

469
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:03,319
You two, guard the main entrance!

470
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:04,160
You, come with me!

471
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,240
We're under attack! We're under attack!

472
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:21,759
What's going on?

473
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,000
We're being ambushed!

474
00:26:34,839 --> 00:26:35,440
Changshun!

475
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:36,440
Changshun!

476
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,599
Master!

477
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:39,799
Be careful.

478
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:40,920
What's happening?

479
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,079
I'm not sure yet.

480
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:46,640
Sounds like bandits to me.

481
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,160
See how many there are.

482
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,759
Old Liu.

483
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:51,160
How many are there?

484
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:52,880
Can't see clearly.

485
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,359
It's pitch black outside.

486
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:55,680
All dark out there.

487
00:26:55,839 --> 00:26:57,640
I heard it, no need to tell me.

488
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:58,880
Guys,

489
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,160
hold your positions!

490
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,079
Yes, Master!

491
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,640
You hear that? Hold your ground!

492
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,359
Got it!

493
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:05,079
Master, it's dangerous here.

494
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,640
You and the young master, get inside quickly.

495
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,079
Alright.

496
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:08,319
Keep watch here.

497
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,319
Go, go! Son, hurry, get inside!

498
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:37,839
You know,

499
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:39,200
after all this fighting,

500
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:42,599
we still don’t know which bandit gang it was.

501
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,440
Or where they came from.

502
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Doesn’t matter who they are.

503
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:49,400
I’m just worried they’ll come back.

504
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,240
Dad,

505
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:54,880
those bandits aren’t stupid.

506
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:56,720
They don’t fight battles they can’t win.

507
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,440
I figure

508
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,200
they’ve had their eyes on our family for a while.

509
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,240
They just didn’t know

510
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,279
how strong we really are.

511
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,000
This time,

512
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,039
they were testing us.

513
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,240
Now they know

514
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:09,319
how many people we have,

515
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,440
how many guns,

516
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:11,559
and how much firepower.

517
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:13,480
It’s all clear to them now.

518
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,720
I’m afraid they’ll come back with a big group.

519
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,599
They could attack us any minute.

520
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,519
If that happens, we’re done for.

521
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:24,079
What’s there to be afraid of?

522
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:25,920
If things get loud,

523
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,359
the Japanese will hear it.

524
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:29,160
They’ll have to come over.

525
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,680
Who knows, maybe

526
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,839
they’re already on their way.

527
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:33,920
Dad,

528
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,440
the Japanese are focused

529
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,559
on the Anti-Japanese United Army.

530
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,759
They don’t have time for bandits.

531
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,480
So what do you think we should do?

532
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:49,960
If you ask me,

533
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,480
I say

534
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:55,599
we need to recruit more men and buy more guns.

535
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:57,920
And I need to start training them fast.

536
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,759
If we recruit, everyone needs a gun.

537
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:03,759
How many people do we need?

538
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:04,759
And how many guns?

539
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,880
We only have six people now.

540
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,400
I think

541
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,440
we should get twenty more.

542
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:14,440
What?

543
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,640
Twenty?

544
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:17,480
That’ll cost a fortune.

545
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,440
Dad,

546
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:20,160
look at it this way—

547
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,279
even if we have mountains of gold,

548
00:29:22,359 --> 00:29:23,920
if we can’t protect it, it’ll belong to someone else.

549
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,079
Right?

550
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:28,920
Well,

551
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:34,480
I need to think about it.

552
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,400
Let me think.

553
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,079
Master

554
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,519
Master

555
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,480
Master, Master

556
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:52,279
Please wake up

557
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:53,519
Darn it

558
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:54,599
Changshun

559
00:29:55,079 --> 00:29:55,839
Wait a moment

560
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,359
Please hurry

561
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:02,839
It's so early

562
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,599
What's going on?

563
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,519
Go outside and take a look

564
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:09,279
Darn it

565
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,680
Come on, slow down

566
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:12,680
Okay

567
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,200
Master, Master

568
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:15,880
Look, just look

569
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:21,720
How did this happen?

570
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,400
Who did this?

571
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:24,440
No idea

572
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:25,000
Look

573
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,039
All the chickens are dead

574
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:27,640
Even a pig was killed

575
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:30,240
Wait, this...

576
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:32,240
This...

577
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,200
Oh my god

578
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,359
This is scary. Where's the pig's head?

579
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:38,359
We looked, couldn't find it

580
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,720
They didn't take the pork

581
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,559
They wanted the pig's head

582
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:44,200
That's strange

583
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,279
Changshun

584
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,440
Where are our guards?

585
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:51,480
I asked them all

586
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,480
They said

587
00:30:52,759 --> 00:30:53,680
They didn't hear anything

588
00:30:54,279 --> 00:30:55,079
Didn't hear

589
00:30:56,599 --> 00:30:57,599
Did you hear anything?

590
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,799
I didn't, Dad

591
00:31:00,039 --> 00:31:00,759
Dad, tell me

592
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,920
Could it be those bandits?

593
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,440
Bandits

594
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,400
Why would they do this?

595
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:07,960
They...

596
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:09,880
They're trying to intimidate us

597
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,640
If it really was them

598
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,359
We're doomed

599
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,039
They can just walk into our home

600
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:17,799
No, Changshun

601
00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:20,759
What are our guards even doing?

602
00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:23,279
Something happened in the yard

603
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:24,240
Who are they guarding?

604
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,359
What are they guarding, really?

605
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:25,799
I...

606
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:26,960
I'll go talk to them now

607
00:31:27,079 --> 00:31:27,799
Enough, enough

608
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:28,720
No more talking

609
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:30,759
No pay tomorrow

610
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:31,640
Fire them all

611
00:31:32,839 --> 00:31:33,200
Don't

612
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,880
Master, you can't do that

613
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,000
If they leave

614
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:38,359
What if the bandits come?

615
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:38,960
That's right

616
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,039
Whatever

617
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,440
At least they're useful

618
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,640
I can't spend money

619
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,079
Feeding a bunch of freeloaders

620
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,440
Alright, Master

621
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:46,839
By the way, Master

622
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,039
So...

623
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:49,880
What do we do with the chickens and pig?

624
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,240
Here's what we'll do

625
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,160
Set up a big pot at the door

626
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,240
Cook it right there

627
00:31:55,559 --> 00:31:57,240
When it's cooked, eat it there

628
00:31:57,319 --> 00:31:58,279
Let the bandits smell it

629
00:31:58,839 --> 00:31:59,839
See if the meat smells good

630
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,799
Make them drool

631
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:04,079
Wow, even this happens

632
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:07,640
Dad, this...

633
00:32:11,319 --> 00:32:13,160
People come in and no one watches

634
00:32:13,319 --> 00:32:14,480
Look at these guys

635
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:16,519
They eat my food, drink my drinks

636
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,200
Getting fat but not smart

637
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:19,799
Might as well feed it to the dogs

638
00:32:22,599 --> 00:32:23,039
Dad

639
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:24,240
If you ask me

640
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,599
We have two choices

641
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:26,599
First

642
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,440
We could just give in

643
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,160
Give them whatever they want

644
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,000
Treat them

645
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,079
Like ancestors, worship them

646
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,079
These bandits

647
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:37,000
Have huge appetites

648
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,440
It's a bottomless pit

649
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,000
No matter how much you give, it's never enough

650
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,640
Or we gather troops

651
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,880
Scare them into submission

652
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,519
Yesterday,

653
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,160
we were busy in the middle of the night,

654
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,920
and now we're at it again early this morning.

655
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,599
I'll take a quick nap.

656
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,559
Alright.

657
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,200
Oh my!

658
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:41,200
Dad, what's wrong?

659
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:43,559
What's wrong?

660
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:44,920
Look, look, look!

661
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,039
Huzi came in.

662
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,240
Son,

663
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,160
hurry up.

664
00:33:51,319 --> 00:33:53,279
Gather troops.

665
00:33:56,079 --> 00:33:57,240
Your dad really agreed.

666
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:00,039
The accountant nearly

667
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:01,640
scattered all the abacus beads.

668
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,880
We're rich now.

669
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,719
Pay whatever needs to be paid.

670
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,679
Don't let your dad lose out.

671
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:12,039
Uncle,

672
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,440
when it comes to fighting the Japanese,

673
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,079
there's no yours or mine.

674
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,639
If we drive the Japanese out,

675
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,880
our Tian family will enjoy peace too.

676
00:34:20,599 --> 00:34:21,480
So our family

677
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:22,599
should do our part.

678
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:24,800
Alright.

679
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:28,039
Then I thank your dad,

680
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:29,880
and thank you too.

681
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:33,679
But

682
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,199
you put that pig's head

683
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,320
in your dad's room.

684
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,599
That move was ruthless.

685
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,400
Why didn't you ask me first?

686
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:44,559
I just did it on impulse.

687
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:45,599
It popped into my head.

688
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:46,679
I didn't have time to tell you.

689
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,000
What if your dad

690
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:48,800
got scared and something happened?

691
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,519
What would we do then?

692
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,119
I was a bit scared afterward too.

693
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,360
But luckily,

694
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,440
my dad's recovered.

695
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,039
It's fine.

696
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:57,920
Alright.

697
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:01,039
Uncle,

698
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,199
Xiaobai Ma is really something.

699
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:06,159
He said he'd help and he did.

700
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:09,519
It's all thanks to Sister Hua.

701
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:11,159
Tell me about it.

702
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,719
This time,

703
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,039
I went to Congshan.

704
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,760
I asked, "Father-in-law,

705
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,920
where have you been lately?"

706
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,039
He went into hiding.

707
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:24,159
After he left last time,

708
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:25,400
there was no news at all.

709
00:35:25,519 --> 00:35:26,679
We were worried.

710
00:35:27,239 --> 00:35:29,039
I missed you all too.

711
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,079
But on the road,

712
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,440
it was really tough.

713
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,599
Japanese soldiers were everywhere.

714
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,000
I was afraid I'd

715
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,159
lead them to you.

716
00:35:38,199 --> 00:35:38,840
Brother,

717
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,880
the food's here.

718
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:42,880
Alright, Dad.

719
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,159
The food's ready, let's start.

720
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:46,880
Put it down.

721
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:49,159
I'll pour Dad's wine.

722
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:50,000
Dad,

723
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,119
let me pour for you.

724
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:52,400
Dad,

725
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,360
Sit down, sit down.

726
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:54,840
Alright.

727
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:56,159
Alright.

728
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,159
Here, Dad.

729
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:57,800
Have some.

730
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,480
Okay.

731
00:35:59,280 --> 00:35:59,760
Here.

732
00:36:00,519 --> 00:36:01,079
Dad,

733
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:05,840
Today our family has double happiness.

734
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,559
What are the two joys?

735
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:09,159
The first is definitely you.

736
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,639
You came up the mountain

737
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:11,559
to see me and Hua.

738
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:12,639
That makes me happy.

739
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:13,599
In my heart,

740
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:15,400
it's as warm as a brazier.

741
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:18,519
The second joy

742
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:21,360
Hua

743
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,599
is pregnant.

744
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:28,199
What's going on here?

745
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,400
Did this scare you?

746
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:31,960
No.

747
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:35,159
This is the first good news.

748
00:36:35,639 --> 00:36:36,360
Great news.

749
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:37,320
First good news.

750
00:36:38,199 --> 00:36:38,840
Come on, come on.

751
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,400
Let's drink for Hua'er.

752
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,239
Come on, drink up.

753
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:42,400
Come on, come on.

754
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:43,000
Come.

755
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:43,960
Bottoms up!

756
00:36:44,159 --> 00:36:44,599
Come.

757
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:45,760
Sit down, sit down.

758
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,719
Don't stand, don't.

759
00:36:50,679 --> 00:36:51,239
Dad,

760
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:52,960
Let me say something from the heart.

761
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,199
Without you,

762
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,480
I couldn't have married such a good wife.

763
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,159
Here, let me pour you a drink.

764
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,159
Just the two of us,

765
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:02,159
should have a drink together.

766
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,840
Dad, have some potatoes.

767
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:05,639
Don't drink too much.

768
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,320
I know, I know.

769
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:08,320
See that?

770
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,800
She's nagging again.

771
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,400
I'm just looking out for you.

772
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,559
Your wife,

773
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:15,639
she's good in every way.

774
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,400
Except for that little rope in her hand.

775
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,159
She pulls it too tight.

776
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,079
Eat, eat up.

777
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:21,840
Come on.

778
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:22,920
Dad,

779
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:24,519
Have an egg.

780
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:24,920
Alright.

781
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:27,000
It's all over your mouth.

782
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:28,679
I'm just doing it for you.

783
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,719
I'm just doing it for you.

784
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,519
Usually,

785
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:32,519
I should drink less.

786
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,920
They say if you drink too much,

787
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:35,079
you do foolish things.

788
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:36,079
Say foolish things.

789
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:37,679
Think I should sleep more.

790
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,119
If I get enough sleep,

791
00:37:39,159 --> 00:37:40,159
I'll have more energy, right?

792
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:41,079
Right?

793
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,039
The most annoying thing is,

794
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:46,880
she wants me to read books.

795
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:49,559
You know how it is.

796
00:37:49,639 --> 00:37:50,679
Oh my,

797
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:51,719
Anyway, all day long,

798
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,400
she's just good to me.

799
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,239
But this "for my own good" thing,

800
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,760
I won't say it anymore, Dad.

801
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,280
Let's eat, let's have some food.

802
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,320
I can tell,

803
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,280
you feel a bit stifled.

804
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:05,880
Me?

805
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:06,760
Not at all.

806
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,000
Then let me toast you.

807
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,159
To make up for it.

808
00:38:09,239 --> 00:38:10,079
No, no, no.

809
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:11,480
That's not what I meant.

810
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:13,679
I know you care about me.

811
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:14,840
Right?

812
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:15,800
If someone

813
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,719
thinks about you all the time,

814
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,679
then what am I?

815
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,159
I'm living

816
00:38:19,159 --> 00:38:20,320
like a bee in a honey pot.

817
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:21,280
Right, Dad?

818
00:38:21,719 --> 00:38:22,400
I'm happy.

819
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:24,159
You're a sensible man.

820
00:38:26,199 --> 00:38:27,039
Why are you laughing?

821
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,480
You haven't toasted your father-in-law.

822
00:38:30,519 --> 00:38:31,719
Come on, Uncle.

823
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:32,760
Come on, let's drink.

824
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:36,719
Sergeant,

825
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:38,320
Did you carve my number?

826
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,360
It's done.

827
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,159
Xiaogui did it for you.

828
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:46,159
I planned to pick you up in autumn.

829
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,400
But things kept happening,

830
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,679
one after another.

831
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:50,320
It got delayed until now.

832
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,159
I understand.

833
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:53,519
It's tough out there.

834
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,440
We made it through the winter.

835
00:38:56,599 --> 00:38:57,719
We're all still alive.

836
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,679
I'm already grateful.

837
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:02,079
Did everyone else get their number?

838
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:05,960
Not yet.

839
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,000
Spring is here now.

840
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,440
I'll go check again.

841
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:13,360
The unit

842
00:39:14,039 --> 00:39:15,679
must be gathered quickly.

843
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,880
Hua'er can rejoin anytime.

844
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:20,679
Hua'er,

845
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,440
you're pregnant now.

846
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:24,719
That Xiaobaima

847
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:25,840
treats you well.

848
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,760
I was thinking when things

849
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,440
get a bit better,

850
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:30,480
I'll come back for you.

851
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,440
Sergeant,

852
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,480
You don't want me anymore, do you?

853
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,440
What are you saying?

854
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:36,800
Sergeant,

855
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:37,960
Do you not want me

856
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:38,760
to rejoin the unit?

857
00:39:41,639 --> 00:39:42,960
I, Lan Hua'er, am a soldier.

858
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,079
Always a soldier of the Anti-Japanese United Army.

859
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:52,960
Platoon Leader

860
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,440
I have another idea.

861
00:39:54,519 --> 00:39:55,239
Go ahead, tell me.

862
00:39:56,599 --> 00:39:57,440
Here at Xiaobaima’s place,

863
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,719
there are people with guns.

864
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,719
Most folks in the village

865
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,599
have a deep grudge against the Japanese soldiers.

866
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,440
I want to bring them in

867
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:05,559
to join our unit.

868
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,440
That would be great!

869
00:40:08,119 --> 00:40:08,639
Well, uh...

870
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,440
But Hua’er, you—

871
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,960
Just say if this will work or not.

872
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:12,920
It’ll work.

873
00:40:13,719 --> 00:40:14,480
Of course it will.

874
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,800
I’m really happy for you.

875
00:40:20,559 --> 00:40:21,360
Our unit

876
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:22,519
will have successors.

877
00:40:24,039 --> 00:40:24,840
We’ll have successors.

878
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:29,880
What?

879
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,440
You want me to lead people

880
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,639
to fight the landlords?

881
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,039
The platoon leader didn’t want to trouble you.

882
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,719
But for this,

883
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:39,360
only you can get it done.

884
00:40:39,639 --> 00:40:40,400
That’s true.

885
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,159
It’s not a real fight.

886
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,719
Just scare them a bit.

887
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,639
Sis Hua’er is really something.

888
00:40:49,159 --> 00:40:50,920
She actually got Xiaobaima under control.

889
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:52,719
Yeah.

890
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,599
Otherwise,

891
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:55,960
we’d have nowhere

892
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,079
to find help.

893
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,079
But Sis Hua’er,

894
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:01,400
if she can’t convince Xiaobaima,

895
00:41:02,039 --> 00:41:04,320
she’ll have to stay up in the mountains.

896
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:07,800
She keeps telling me

897
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,920
she wants to rejoin the unit.

898
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:13,679
How can she rejoin then?

899
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:15,559
Will Xiaobaima agree to that?

900
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,079
That’s for later.

901
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:20,199
Let’s take it one step at a time.

902
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,360
By the way,

903
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,960
when everyone’s here,

904
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,599
you need to keep things under control.

905
00:41:29,159 --> 00:41:30,960
Don’t take anyone with a bad heart.

906
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:33,000
Don’t worry, Uncle.

907
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,559
I’ve replaced all the old guards.

908
00:41:34,599 --> 00:41:35,480
They’re all new people now.

909
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,159
I’ll let you check each one.

910
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:37,960
Good.

911
00:41:38,519 --> 00:41:39,159
And also,

912
00:41:39,559 --> 00:41:40,719
once they arrive,

913
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,400
train them as soon as possible.

914
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,159
The sooner—

915
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,079
the better.

916
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:18,360
No matter how long this war lasts,

917
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:21,639
victory will be ours.

918
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,920
Our blood and passion

919
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:26,400
if shed, must be shed

920
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,880
on our homeland, the land of forests and rivers.

921
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,840
As long as I, Laoshandong,

922
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,800
have a breath left,

923
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,239
I’ll lead everyone back to the unit.

924
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:35,000
If anyone

925
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,360
makes it out alive,

926
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:40,320
head straight to Mudanjiang.

927
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:44,079
Go to Eight Pines, north of Songlin Town.

928
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,239
Find the thickest

929
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,719
and tallest pine tree.

930
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:50,599
Carve your number on it.

931
00:42:51,559 --> 00:42:52,800
If Deyuan comes back,

932
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,960
have him bring us a message.

933
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:56,719
As long as we know

934
00:42:56,719 --> 00:42:57,800
he’s safe, that’s enough.
