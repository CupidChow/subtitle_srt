00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,350
Yingxian!

13
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:53,760
Do you know

14
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,640
that he has been lying to you?

15
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,760
20 years ago,

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,070
he was the young master of the Gu family.

17
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,920
After the Gu family was wiped out by enemies,

18
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,200
the butler, Fu Beihai, adopted him

19
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,870
and changed his name to Fu Cheng.

20
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:10,910
They have always thought

21
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,520
that the Jiang family took all of the Gu family's assets.

22
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,840
So, they approached you

23
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,680
to recover the same.

24
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:18,470
Yingxian,

25
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:19,910
hear me out.

26
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,120
It's not what you think.

27
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,430
There's no need to explain.

28
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,280
Are you trying to say that you have no ulterior motives

29
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,910
by approaching Yingxian?

30
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,310
Or are you trying to say

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,680
that your name isn't Fu Cheng?

32
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:37,560
Yingxian,

33
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,800
you cannot marry him.

34
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,190
If you marry him,

35
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,000
you're letting them get away with their plan.

36
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,520
Mr. Shen.

37
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,000
I take note of what you just told me.

00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,960

Find out who made him so interested in Fu Cheng.

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,040
Boss.

74
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,800
Only those in the family know

75
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,950
you are going to propose to Fu Cheng.

about Fu Cheng's situation.

79
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,560
I knew it was Fu Zhi's doing,

80
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,310
but I need more concrete evidence.

81
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,630
In that case,

82
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,190
do we need to verify

00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,830
whether the information is true?

00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,430
Judging from his reaction today,

85
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,600
it's obvious that it is true.

I think

89
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,720
he had an ulterior motive

90
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,040
when he first approached me.

91
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,870
Later,

92
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,600
he probably discovered

93
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,750
that we were not related to the Gu family.

00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:12,310
Furthermore, he has fallen in love with me.

117

She isn't!

124
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,390
She is not related

00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,480
to the annihilation of the Gu family.

she is currently the head of the Jiang family.

00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,360
She should be responsible for everything the Jiang family did.

The Jiang family

130
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,830
has nothing to do with what happened back then.

131
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,070
It was your father

132
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,240
who accidentally leaked information

133
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:04,560
about the Gu family to the enemies

134
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,270
which caused the Gu family to be wiped out.

135
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,720
The Jiang family only used the opportunity

136
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,310
to acquire most of the Gu family's assets at a low price.

137
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,070
Jiang Zhen took advantage of the situation,

138
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,070
but he didn't do anything harmful.

139
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:24,870
Impossible.

140
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,510
My father...

141
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,680
My father said it was the Jiang family.

142
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:36,630
I think Uncle Fu felt very guilty,

143
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,720
and it turned into a grudge.

144
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:46,200
However, he couldn't abandon both of us.

145
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,510
So, he put the blame

146
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:52,240
on the Jiang family,

147
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,200
who gained the most out of this.

148
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,670
He lied to us

149
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,080
and lied to himself.

150
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,360
It's all my fault.

151
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,240
If I hadn't exposed his lies,

152
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,640
he wouldn't have committed suicide.

153
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,480
I've let him down.

154
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,550
Why did this happen?

155
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,960

I don't care if there's a grudge between you and the Gu family.

164
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,720
You caused my father's death

165
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,440
and stole Fu Cheng away from me.

166
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,360

It's time for you to lose everything.

169
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,320
Fu Cheng, there's a new mission.

170
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,150
You are required to return to the camp with me.

171
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,150

Since you are busy,

174
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,550
you should return to the camp with this officer.

175
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,790
I will explain it to Yingxian for you.

176
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,030
All right.

177
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,440
Zhi.

178
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,870
You must help me clear things up.

00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,390
Let's go.

180
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:50,000
What?

181
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,320
He left without saying a word?

182
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,670
The person following Fu Zhi said

183
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,840
someone picked up Fu Cheng and left the city.

184
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,670

185
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,000
Fu Zhi is meeting someone

186
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,030
but I'm not sure who she will be meeting.

187
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:19,360
Hello.

00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,360

00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,360
Mr. Yingqi?

190
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,600
What? You're back?

191
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,390
If Miss Jiang finds out,

192
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,150
she will be angry.

193
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,720
All right.

194
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:33,840
I'll send it to you right away.

195
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,630
However, you must tell Miss Jiang.

196
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,960
Otherwise, I can't help you.

197
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:40,600
All right.

198
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,550
Hello. Is this the Bureau of Telecommunication?

199
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,550
Can you help me check

200
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,200
the phone number that just called here?

201
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,120
Yes. The previous call.

202
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:19,630
Hello.

203
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,240
Is it Mr. Jiang?

204
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,790
It has been so long, Mr. Jiang.

205
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:45,960
Are you the one who asked me to meet you here?

206
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:48,320
Do we know each other?

207
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:49,870
I am Fu Zhi.

208
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,840
Fu Zhi?

209
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:54,960
It sounds familiar.

210
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,270
Were you the one at Haicheng the other day?

211
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:00,840
It's me.

212
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,910
Why are you looking for me?

213
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,600
Yingxian should have

214
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,630
paid you the compensation that day.

215
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:07,750
What?

216
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,630
Are you here to ask for more money today?

217
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,840
You're mistaken, Mr. Jiang.

218
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,200
I came to find you

219
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,630
because I want to work with you.

220
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,360
Work with me?

221
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,030
Why do you want to work with me?

222
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:21,240
Miss Jiang sent you abroad

223
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:22,870
yet you came back in secret

224
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,270
because you wanted

225
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,390
to be the head of the Jiang family.

226
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:30,960
Are you trying to tell me

227
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,480
that you can help me

228
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,200
become the head?

229
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,440
I can help you indeed.

230
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,080
What do you want from me?

231
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,480
Are you trying to become my wife?

232
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:48,910
You are overthinking, Mr. Jiang.

233
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,790
I just want Miss Jiang

234
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,320
to stop clinging to my brother.

235
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:54,840
Your brother?

236
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:57,960
Who is your brother?

237
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:58,670
Fu Cheng.

238
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,790
Fu Cheng...

239
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,030
My sister's handsome bodyguard?

240
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:09,030
Yingxian is interested in him?

241
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,240
She must be out of her mind.

242
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,270
Anyway,

243
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,200
I am the only person who can help you now.
