2
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:31,680
 ♫ Drifting aimlessly  Not knowing where to go ♫ 

3
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:37,340
 ♫ The moonlight tonight feels sorrowful ♫ 

4
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:42,680
 ♫ I stand alone against it ♫ 

5
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,980
 ♫ But I don't want to ♫ 

6
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:51,780
 ♫ The longing catches me off guard ♫ 

7
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:59,180
 ♫ To the silent night, I surrender myself ♫ 

8
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:01,580
 ♫ Tossing and turning, lost in confusion ♫ 

9
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:11,320
 ♫ In the darkness, I lose my way ♫ 

10
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:33,210
   

11
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:35,980
   

12
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,279
- Remember to get clearer shots. 
 - Got it.

13
00:01:42,279 --> 00:01:44,960
Thank you for putting in a good word for us, Director Yu.

14
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,239
Once we get through this, we'll repay your kindness handsomely.

15
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:52,560
Actually, it'd be easier to get in touch with Governor Jin through Master Shen.

16
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,719
It's an honor for me that you've come to me.

17
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,940
   

18
00:02:05,999 --> 00:02:09,880
"Second Miss Jiang, newly appointed head of the Jiang family, makes a high-profile appearance.

19
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,299
She was seen in close interaction with a senior member of the Sun faction,

20
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:15,760
leaving the Jiang family's future uncertain."

21
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,480
Boss, isn't this a bit much?

22
00:02:21,119 --> 00:02:23,380
Any updates on Shen Dongyang?

23
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,380
Mr. Shen must be swamped right now.

24
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,920
With the assistance of Governor Jin,

25
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,200
Commander Chen has been stepping up his military fee collections.

26
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:37,559
Now, from government officials to business owners, everyone's walking on eggshells.

27
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:42,039
It seems Shen Dongyang won't be able to hold out much longer.

28
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:45,940
How are the study abroad plans for Yingqi coming along?

29
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:48,940
Youngest Young Master is very reluctant to go.

30
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,839
He came by the company a couple of days ago to see you,

31
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:54,720
but seeing you weren't here, he left in a huff.

32
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,480
When is he going to grow up?

33
00:03:01,839 --> 00:03:04,880
Boss, your headaches have been getting worse lately.

34
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,160
Should I call a doctor?

35
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,760
I'm fine.

36
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,119
The illusion of peace in Gangcheng won't last much longer.

37
00:03:15,119 --> 00:03:18,839
If Jiang Yingqi stays here, he'll only cause more trouble for me.

38
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,780
Here, Boss.

39
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:45,639
Have all the company's liquid assets been converted into gold bars?

40
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:51,480
Almost. The only funds left untouched are for the Jiangbei Village and dock projects,

41
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,119
which still need to proceed. The rest has all been converted.

42
00:03:55,119 --> 00:03:56,679
Good.

43
00:04:06,119 --> 00:04:09,040
Miss Jiang, what's this about?

44
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,639
The Jiang family has been doing business in Gangcheng for generations.

45
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:16,120
We have deep ties to this city, just like Commander Chen.

46
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:20,319
Mr. Jin, I'd appreciate it if you could inform the commander of our position.

47
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:23,799
We're willing to contribute 100,000 silver dollars to the Nan Army.

48
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,720
I'm sure Commander Chen will make the right decision.

49
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,879
Even if he doesn't consider Mr. Shen's interests,

50
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:39,480
he'll surely take my word into account, and won't recklessly harm the Jiang family.

51
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:53,600
Jiang Yingxian is really something.

52
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,339
She knows the Shen family can't be trusted, so she's already secured a new backer.

53
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,799
Mr. Jin is the newly appointed governor.

54
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:04,600
He's the one who can really speak to Commander Chen right now.

55
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,480
Wait. The Shen family can't be trusted?

56
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,559
- What happened? 
 - You don't know?

57
00:05:10,559 --> 00:05:16,060
The Shen family was reported a few days ago, for arms trafficking.

58
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,679
Arms trafficking?

59
00:05:17,679 --> 00:05:20,040
They're under investigation right now.

60
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:23,219
But she's engaged to the Shen family's only son.

61
00:05:23,219 --> 00:05:27,259
How can she be so bold as to reach out to military figures?

62
00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:29,400
Who knows?

63
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,479
Right now, everyone's keeping a low profile and waiting to see how things play out.

64
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:40,940
But not her. She used her father's illness to seize power, and has been flaunting it everywhere.

65
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:45,319
The Shen family won't marry her at a time like this.

66
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:49,199
But the Jiang family has brought a lot of profit to the Shen family over the years.

67
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,679
They wouldn't really cut ties like that, would they?

68
00:05:51,679 --> 00:05:55,640
The Shen family is barely holding it together now.

69
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:59,439
As for Commander Chen, he'd drain every last bit of money from Haicheng and Gangcheng

70
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:01,799
if he had the chance.

71
00:06:02,559 --> 00:06:06,520
Will the war really reach Gangcheng?

72
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,540
It's hard to say.

73
00:06:25,369 --> 00:06:27,049
You're here early.

74
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,620
I had some free time today.

75
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,040
Sir.

76
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,319
The food's cold.

77
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,999
Take it away.

78
00:06:45,999 --> 00:06:49,659
I really appreciate your help with Yingqi's situation.

79
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:52,480
Thanks to you, we weren't dragged down by the Lu family.

80
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,620
Yingxian, I've been in a tough spot lately too.

81
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,040
About our engagement...

82
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,559
I'm sorry.

83
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,820
No need to apologize.

84
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,879
I'd do the same in your position.

85
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:10,180
I understand your situation.

86
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:15,420
I mean, if even I could find this document,

87
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:20,699
it wouldn't be hard for Commander Chen to get it if he wants to dig deeper.

88
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:26,720
Cutting ties now is the best option for both our families.

89
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,740
You already knew?

90
00:07:43,239 --> 00:07:47,879
After nearly getting killed in Haicheng, I had to check.

91
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:51,019
You don't owe me anything.

92
00:07:51,019 --> 00:07:54,600
We've benefited each other these years.

93
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,980
I'm leaving now.

94
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,799
Let me walk you home.

95
00:08:00,799 --> 00:08:04,420
It's not a good idea for us to be seen together.

96
00:08:07,359 --> 00:08:09,040
Yingxian.

97
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,919
Are you doing this on purpose?

98
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,699
Is it because of that bodyguard?

99
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,640
We've known each other for so long.

100
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,799
Do you really think I'd sacrifice my interests for a man?

101
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,780
 

102
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,280
It's me.

103
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:56,319
I'll take care of the task you gave me as soon as possible.

104
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,719
Yes.

105
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:00,300
No problem.

106
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:03,160
Alright.

107
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,980
 

108
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:50,040
Have a seat.
This isn't your first time here.

109
00:09:57,319 --> 00:09:59,640
Why are you standing there?

110
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:06,160
Are you here to see if I've been faithful to you?

111
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,079
No, that's not it.

112
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:13,040
Then why didn't you tell me you were coming back?

113
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,400
You didn't reply to my letter either.

114
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:21,839
The battle in Haicheng is over.

115
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,739
They sent me back to Gangcheng at the last minute,

116
00:10:24,739 --> 00:10:29,559
so I couldn't inform you in advance.

117
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:32,040
Then why didn't you reply to my letter?

118
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,719
It was just a stack of photos.

119
00:10:34,719 --> 00:10:38,400
- Besides...
- What, you couldn't reply to the photos?

120
00:10:42,439 --> 00:10:44,199
Did you miss me?

121
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,799
You're exhausted. You need rest.

122
00:10:58,319 --> 00:11:00,160
I don't need rest.

123
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,760
I need you.

124
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:29,920


125
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:38,320
 ♫ Drifting aimlessly  Not knowing where to go ♫ 

126
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,980
 ♫ The moonlight tonight feels sorrowful ♫

 ♫ The music plays in the city's churches ♫

 ♫ I should've been with you forever ♫

 ♫ But it can't last when there's chaos ♫ 

136
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:55,500
 ♫ And when I look back,
there is just rubble and empty alleys ♫

00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:16,980

00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:20,400
 ♫ I hope your future is safe and sound ♫

00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:25,100
 ♫ That's my only wish ♫ 

142
00:13:25,667 --> 00:13:27,810
 ♫ Forget it ♫ 

143
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:30,500
 ♫ It doesn't matter ♫ 

144
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:35,780
 ♫ It really doesn't matter ♫
