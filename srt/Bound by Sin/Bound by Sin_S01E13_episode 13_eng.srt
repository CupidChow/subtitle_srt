1
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:15,030


2
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:31,680
♫  Wandering aimlessly with no destination in mind  ♫

3
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:37,340
♫  Tonight's moonlight feels desolate  ♫

4
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,680
♫  Alone, I try to block it out  ♫

5
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,880
♫  But unexpectedly  ♫

6
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:51,880
♫  The longing is unavoidable  ♫

7
00:00:53,100 --> 00:01:00,020
♫  The silent night compels me to surrender  ♫

8
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:11,880
♫  Wandering in the darkness, I lose my way  ♫

9
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:33,200
   

10
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,080
   

11
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:41,139
In what capacity are you having this meeting with us today?

12
00:01:41,139 --> 00:01:44,560
Naturally, I'm speaking as the head of the Jiang family.

13
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,040
The invitations I sent to all of you today

14
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,600
were stamped with the seal of the head of the family, right?

15
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,159
What?

16
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,239
Did Jiang Zhen really hand control over to you?

17
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:58,700
I bet you took advantage of your father being sick,

18
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,960
and secretly seized the seal.

19
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,739
Do you think you can fool us with such underhanded tricks?

20
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,880
If you don't believe me you can go to the hospital yourselves.

21
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,900
My father woke up this afternoon.

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,160
You can take a look at these documents.

23
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,700
   

24
00:02:33,799 --> 00:02:37,040
Jiang Yingxian, what do you mean by this?

25
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,700
Are you trying to threaten us with these?

26
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,880
Third Uncle, please calm down.

27
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:50,280
If I know about this, my father certainly does too.

28
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,780
Since he hasn't questioned your accounts, I won't either.

29
00:02:57,639 --> 00:03:03,760
Yingxian, I don't have a problem with you taking charge from here on out.

30
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:09,399
But, you see, the way you're going about this is putting everyone in a difficult position.

31
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,600
Uncles, do you know what's happening to the Lu family?

32
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,859
The Lu family?

33
00:03:18,859 --> 00:03:22,160
I heard Governor Jin raided their house.

34
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,179
What does that have to do with us?

35
00:03:26,119 --> 00:03:28,200
There's war everywhere now.

36
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,799
The Revolutionary Army is already here.

37
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:37,200
I'm sure you've all heard many different versions of the story.

38
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,720
But at the end of the day, the Nan Army is running out of money.

39
00:03:44,359 --> 00:03:50,040
Right now, only I can help the Jiang family get through this.

40
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,019
You?

41
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:54,220
With your fiancé?

42
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:57,499
You think he can save our family?

43
00:03:57,499 --> 00:04:01,079
Well, I have my ways.

44
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:04,730
Second Child, if you really can save the Jiang family,

45
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:08,170
I'll accept you as head of the family.

46
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,119
 Now, Shen Dongyang is the last one to deal with. 

47
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,439
Yingxian, this is the first time you've let me stay the night.

48
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:56,319
I'm so happy.

49
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:03,600
Dongyang, do you really want to marry me?

50
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:24,940
 ♫ In my eyes, it's starting to rain again ♫ 

51
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:28,220
 ♫ I turn around and bury the past ♫ 

52
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,400
 ♫ In a daze, I see you ♫ 

53
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,900
 ♫ How sweet we once were ♫ 

54
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:39,280
 ♫ Now I'm left standing here alone ♫ 

55
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,340
 ♫ The words left unsaid still linger in my heart ♫ 

56
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:47,141
 ♫ The cat we raised is still at home ♫ 

57
00:05:47,141 --> 00:05:50,660
 ♫ Is it waiting for you ♫ 

58
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:53,139
 I've seen you many times before. 

59
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:58,860
Your father keeps bringing you
to all these banquets.

60
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:04,039
He never stops bragging about you.

61
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,459
Really?

62
00:06:06,459 --> 00:06:08,579
So that's what everyone thinks.

63
00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:10,319
I'm flattered.

64
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,820
 ♫ When the meteors streak across the sky ♫ 

65
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,680
 ♫ And sink into the deep sea ♫ 

66
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,479
Want one?

67
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,434
No, thanks.

68
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:27,740
Your eyes say otherwise.

69
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,899
Doesn't it get tiring, always acting so composed?

70
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:35,500
Isn't life about struggling?

71
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,439
Besides, smoking cigarettes is no fun.

72
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:41,940
If you're going to smoke, go for a cigar.

73
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:55,999
 For Shen Dongyang, that little spark of attraction 

74
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:59,919
 wasn't enough to make him give up power and wealth. 

75
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,860
Yingxian.

76
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:12,220
You're not still upset about what happened in Haicheng, are you?

77
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,239
It was just a random question.

78
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,160
Maybe I'm having pre-wedding anxiety.

79
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,860
I've been overthinking a lot.

80
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,400
I do think you've been overthinking a lot lately.

81
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,380
If I don't marry you, who should I marry instead?

82
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,770
Well,

83
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,520
your true love.

84
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,280
My true love?

85
00:07:38,359 --> 00:07:39,799
Who's that?

86
00:07:39,799 --> 00:07:42,520
That's something only you know.

87
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:45,330
What

88
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,990
if it's you?

89
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,920
Are you upset that I sent you to Haicheng,

90
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:03,339
or did you meet someone while you were there?

91
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:11,779
Don't tell me it's that bodyguard with a pretty face.

92
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,339
Shen Dongyang.

93
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,600
Are you jealous?

94
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,840
And if I am?

95
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,239
You know...

96
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:29,620
how possessive I am of you.

97
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,140
That's not like you at all.

98
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:36,760
Besides, I don't think you have the right to be jealous.

99
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,360
Don't look at me like that, Dongyang.

100
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,759
I've never interfered with what you do outside.

101
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,799
Jiang Yingxian,

102
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:51,740
the political and business worlds in the Nanli Region are on the brink of collapse.

103
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:57,120
I just hope our families can work together to get through this disaster,

104
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,719
instead of ending up in a lose-lose situation.

105
00:08:59,719 --> 00:09:05,839
To that end, you and I are in this together.

106
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,160
So, Dongyang, you still care about my family, huh?

107
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:15,079
I thought you were putting me and my family at risk so you could be with Zhou Xiaoqing.

108
00:09:16,599 --> 00:09:19,360
So, you're upset because of her?

109
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,880
She's been with you for so long.

110
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,839
Haven't you thought about being with her for real?

111
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:31,099
How can she ever compare to you?

112
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,779
I'm tired. I won't see you out.

113
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:54,539
Jiang Yingxian, you're really testing the limits of my gentlemanly patience.

114
00:09:57,079 --> 00:10:01,520
 I thought it'd be easier to break off the engagement by teaming up with Zhou Xiaoqing. 

115
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,020
I wonder what Fu Cheng is doing now.

116
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,199
Major, there's a letter for you.

117
00:10:28,199 --> 00:10:30,719
   

118
00:10:30,719 --> 00:10:33,479
Is it from Sister-in-law?

119
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,100
What's wrong? Did something happen back home?

120
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:47,859
It's nothing. You go ahead.

121
00:10:47,859 --> 00:10:50,520
I'll head back for a bit.

122
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,280
Jiang Yingxian!

123
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:40,040


124
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:04,074
♫  When will I stop panicking?  ♫

125
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:11,620
♫  I feel like I've accepted this miserable life  ♫

126
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,960
