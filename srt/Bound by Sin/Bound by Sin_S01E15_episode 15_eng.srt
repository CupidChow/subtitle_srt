1
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:16,140


2
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,680
 ♫ Drifting aimlessly  Not knowing where to go ♫ 

3
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:37,340
 ♫ The moonlight tonight feels sorrowful ♫ 

4
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:42,680
 ♫ I stand alone against it ♫ 

5
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,880
 ♫ But I don't want to ♫ 

6
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:51,780
 ♫ The longing catches me off guard ♫ 

7
00:00:53,100 --> 00:01:00,020
 ♫ To the silent night, I surrender myself ♫ 

8
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:11,680
 ♫ Tossing and turning, lost in confusion In the darkness, I lose my way ♫ 

9
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:33,280
   

10
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,980
 

11
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,899
Brother!

12
00:01:55,175 --> 00:01:57,956
Xiao Zhi, what are you doing here?

13
00:01:57,956 --> 00:02:00,676
Where were you, Brother?

14
00:02:01,956 --> 00:02:03,916
Go.

15
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:05,676
Come back soon.

16
00:02:11,916 --> 00:02:13,476
Let's go.

17
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:27,356
Xiao Zhi, how is your father doing?

18
00:02:27,976 --> 00:02:30,315
He's no longer with us.

19
00:02:32,476 --> 00:02:33,955
When did that happen?

20
00:02:33,955 --> 00:02:37,816
Shortly after you left Gangcheng, he...

21
00:02:37,816 --> 00:02:42,215
I don't know what got into him which made him feel hopeless.

22
00:02:42,215 --> 00:02:44,670
Moreover, a few days before he passed away,

23
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,595
he kept saying that he failed you.

24
00:02:47,595 --> 00:02:51,036
Fu Cheng, what did my father do?

25
00:02:51,036 --> 00:02:54,656
Xiao Zhi, it's my fault.

26
00:02:54,656 --> 00:02:57,096
I shouldn't have...

27
00:02:57,096 --> 00:03:00,856
Brother, where have you been in the past few months?

28
00:03:00,856 --> 00:03:03,256
I couldn't find you at all.

29
00:03:03,256 --> 00:03:07,096
All I could do was wait for you near Jiang's Trading Company every day.

30
00:03:07,096 --> 00:03:09,215
And today, you finally appeared.

31
00:03:09,215 --> 00:03:10,916
I...

32
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:13,515
I was away from Gangcheng for the past few months.

33
00:03:13,515 --> 00:03:15,636
I only came back yesterday.

34
00:03:19,515 --> 00:03:24,395
Did Miss Jiang send you away for work?

35
00:03:24,395 --> 00:03:27,615
No. I joined the army.

36
00:03:27,615 --> 00:03:30,716
Did you come back now to bring me with you?

37
00:03:30,716 --> 00:03:32,316
Xiao Zhi.

38
00:03:33,555 --> 00:03:37,876
There are many rules in the army, so I...

39
00:03:37,876 --> 00:03:41,515
But I have been all alone for the past few months.

40
00:03:41,515 --> 00:03:43,555
I have no one to rely on.

41
00:03:43,555 --> 00:03:45,455
I was hoping to find you.

42
00:03:45,455 --> 00:03:47,215
- Brother. 
 - Xiao Zhi.

43
00:03:47,215 --> 00:03:50,775
You know what? I'll think of a solution.

44
00:03:58,776 --> 00:04:01,257
Mr. Fu. Miss Fu. Let me handle the luggage.

45
00:04:01,257 --> 00:04:03,395
Thanks.

46
00:04:03,395 --> 00:04:05,136
This way, please.

47
00:04:17,836 --> 00:04:21,355
Brother, am I staying here for real?

48
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:31,380
The guest room has been cleaned.

49
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,030
You can place your luggage there now.

50
00:04:33,036 --> 00:04:35,156
I have to head to the company.

51
00:04:39,115 --> 00:04:41,836
Come and find me once you settle down.

52
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:46,076
Tell the driver not to drive so fast.

53
00:04:50,115 --> 00:04:51,916
Stay safe.

54
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:56,716
See you.

55
00:05:05,156 --> 00:05:08,516
Xiao Zhi, let's check out the guest room. Come.

56
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:12,596
Brother, why must I stay here?

57
00:05:12,596 --> 00:05:14,736
I'm scared.

58
00:05:17,376 --> 00:05:19,468
Gangcheng hasn't been a safe place recently.

59
00:05:19,468 --> 00:05:21,315
I have to travel soon in a few days.

60
00:05:21,315 --> 00:05:25,956
Staying with the Jiangs means you can look after each other when something happens.

61
00:05:25,956 --> 00:05:31,195
Brother, are you seeing Miss Jiang now?

62
00:05:33,636 --> 00:05:38,836
Once the dust settles, I will propose to her.

63
00:05:40,555 --> 00:05:42,450
But

64
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:47,490
I'm not sure if she'll say yes.

65
00:05:48,736 --> 00:05:51,036
I see.

66
00:06:01,115 --> 00:06:04,636
Boss, I have retrieved the bespoke ring you ordered.

67
00:06:07,464 --> 00:06:11,235
Boss, are you truly proposing to Fu Cheng soon?

68
00:06:11,235 --> 00:06:14,655
Yes. I want to make it official.

69
00:06:14,655 --> 00:06:18,156
That way, he won't have second thoughts about my genuine feelings.

70
00:06:18,156 --> 00:06:22,215
Boss, I know you are now the head of the Jiang family.

71
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,156
You have annulled your marital arrangement with Shen Dongyang.

72
00:06:24,156 --> 00:06:26,016
And you're no longer under Master's thumb.

73
00:06:26,016 --> 00:06:27,490
But Fu Cheng is not...

74
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:29,435
I know what you're about to say.

75
00:06:29,435 --> 00:06:33,769
However, whether it was at Jiangbei Village or Haicheng,

76
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:38,195
without Fu Cheng, we wouldn't have been able to have this conversation here.

77
00:06:38,195 --> 00:06:40,916
Boss. I understand you have feelings.

78
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:43,795
But have you entertained the notion that perhaps, he was just doing his job?

79
00:06:43,795 --> 00:06:44,940
It's not you.

80
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:48,390
If it was another Zhang Yingxian or Li Yingxian, he'd save her nonetheless.

81
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:52,396
He didn't perform the act because of you. He did it out of a sense of duty.

82
00:06:52,396 --> 00:06:58,076
You said once that he mentioned he'd save any of his peers in Haicheng.

83
00:06:58,076 --> 00:07:00,636
That's why I fell for him.

84
00:07:02,315 --> 00:07:03,830
I don't understand.

85
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:07,670
Love isn't just about fidelity.

86
00:07:08,476 --> 00:07:14,235
Anyone can temporarily turn into an amazing lover under the influence of desires.

87
00:07:14,235 --> 00:07:15,540
That is a performance.

88
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,790
It is the best of what a person can do intentionally.

89
00:07:19,555 --> 00:07:21,115
I'm not a romantic.

90
00:07:21,115 --> 00:07:22,470
Compared to what a person intends to do,

91
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:25,170
I'd rather believe what a person does naturally.

92
00:07:27,076 --> 00:07:29,235
Yes, you're right, Boss.

93
00:07:29,235 --> 00:07:35,312
But didn't you always say that love only played a small part in life?

94
00:07:35,312 --> 00:07:37,200
Once the infatuation fades away,

95
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:41,030
the greatest value a partner can provide isn't his emotional support,

96
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:44,410
but joint profitability.

97
00:07:46,691 --> 00:07:48,092
Yes.

98
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:53,371
However, it's a chaotic time now.

99
00:07:53,371 --> 00:07:57,371
No one knows what the future holds.

100
00:07:58,052 --> 00:08:00,512
I've been thinking lately.

101
00:08:00,512 --> 00:08:05,031
Perhaps profits aren't the most important thing in life.

102
00:08:06,092 --> 00:08:09,932
You know that I've been reining in my family business.

103
00:08:09,932 --> 00:08:14,451
It's not because of Shen Dongyang, but because of the current circumstances.

104
00:08:14,451 --> 00:08:18,410
Still, Boss, even if Fu Cheng is the right man,

105
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:21,131
a woman shouldn't be the one proposing.

106
00:08:21,131 --> 00:08:24,011
Isn't it the man's job?

107
00:08:24,011 --> 00:08:27,911
There shouldn't be a rule regarding who should propose first.

108
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:33,571
Get everything ready.

109
00:08:49,532 --> 00:08:52,152
What are you working on? Do you need my help?

110
00:08:52,152 --> 00:08:54,432
No need, Miss Fu. Just focus on your work.

111
00:08:54,432 --> 00:08:57,092
Miss Ke said that there'd be a huge announcement

112
00:08:57,092 --> 00:08:59,772
once Miss Jiang and Mr. Fu returned from the church.

113
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:02,012
She asked us to decorate the place.

114
00:09:02,012 --> 00:09:05,292
I see. Don't let me keep you here.

115
00:09:28,851 --> 00:09:30,272
Wait for me here.

116
00:09:30,272 --> 00:09:33,132
I'm going inside to get something.

117
00:09:33,132 --> 00:09:34,851
Inside the church?

118
00:09:34,851 --> 00:09:38,691
At this dangerous time, the church provides a good hiding spot.

119
00:09:44,412 --> 00:09:47,571
Go ahead. I'll wait for you here.

120
00:10:14,091 --> 00:10:15,731
Yingxian!

121
00:10:31,012 --> 00:10:34,372
Don't just stand there. I've been waiting for you.

122
00:10:57,611 --> 00:11:00,552
I thought it wouldn't take you too long to barge in.

123
00:11:01,211 --> 00:11:03,391
Who would have thought that you could hold yourself back this long?

124
00:11:04,032 --> 00:11:05,552
Yingxian.

125
00:11:26,675 --> 00:11:32,256
Mr. Fu Cheng, would you like to marry Miss Jiang Yingxian?

126
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,735
Yingxian!

127
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:50,130
