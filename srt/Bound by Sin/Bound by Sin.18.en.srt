[Episode 18]

12
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,150
Yingxian, you made a good move.

13
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:50,920
You knew I had returned

14
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:52,840
but you still let me embarrass myself in front of our uncles.

15
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,920
I hope you enjoyed the show.

16
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,680
If I didn't let you suffer,

17
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:00,040
would you know what you're made of?

18
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,510
Wait.

19
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:02,790
I don't get it.

20
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,920
You are the head of the Jiang family now.

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,640
Shouldn't we work together

22
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,630
to retrieve their businesses?

23
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,910
Right now,

24
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,430
you are letting them continue their businesses

25
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,960
while sending your brother abroad.

26
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,190
If I hadn't done that,

27
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,000
you would've taken so much of our family assets.

28
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,310
How did you end up working with Fu Zhi?

29
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,030
She came to me first.

30
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,590
Yingxian,

31
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,800
I saw you leaving the city that day.

32
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,190
Why did you come back?

33
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,680
Her tricks

34
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,000
could only fool you.

35
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,310
I received a telegram about Fu Cheng being badly ill.

36
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,710
I thought it was too much of a coincidence,

37
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,840
so I investigated it

38
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,360
and found out the information was false.

39
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:47,030
Moreover, both of you have been acting weirdly,

40
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,590
so I took advantage of the plan

41
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,870
and let her see me leave the city.

42
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:52,310
That's...

43
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,590
Fu Zhi is not that impressive.

44
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,120
Why did Fu Zhi agree to help you?

45
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,870
What conditions did you agree to?

46
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,430
Nothing.

47
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,750
Jiang Yingqi.

48
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,470
Have you forgotten

49
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,800
the feeling of having a gun pointed at your head?

50
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,520
Stop it.

51
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,400
She doesn't want you to be with Fu Cheng.

52
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,680
Yingxian, tell me honestly.

53
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,960
When you received the telegram,

54
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,190
you didn't believe it easily.

55
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,120
Do you not like Fu Cheng as much as you think?

56
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,470
Without Fu Zhi's intervention,

57
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,430
Fu Cheng would already be your brother-in-law.

60
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,280
Fu Zhi left the city alone.

61
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,800
She was heading towards Haicheng.

62
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,400
It's chaotic nowadays.

63
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,310
She is really brave for a young girl.

64
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,240
If something happens to her...

65
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,430
Send a telegram to Fu Cheng

66
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,750
and ask him to aid her.

67
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,400
Stay here and take care of the Jiang family.

68
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,360
I'll leave the city

69
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,590

00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:05,840
It's from Gangcheng.

00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,430

82
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,000
What are you doing?

83

Girl,

84
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,870
there are so many of us.

85
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:58,600
We had to suffer so much

86
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:59,750
because of what you told us.

87
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,560
What if we were fooled?

88
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:02,920
Wouldn't we do all this for nothing

89
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,390
if we don't get paid?

90
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,120
We can only release you

91
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,190
after getting the money.

92
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,390
Getting the money is your problem.

93
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,480
It's none of my business.

94
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,360
Let me go!

95
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,390
Don't force us to do this the hard way.

96
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:14,480
Take her with us.

97
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,630
- Let go! - Move!

98
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,510
Let go!

99
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:42,870
Fu Zhi.

100
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,430
Where is this?

101
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,480
Miss Yingxian.

102
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:50,630
This is a bandits' stronghold.

103
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,920
It was all my fault for leaving the city alone,

104
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,510
so I ended up getting kidnapped.

105
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,040
Stop crying.

106
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,800
Before I left the city, I sent a telegram to your brother.

107
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:05,360
He will surely come and find us

108
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,190
if he doesn't see us anywhere.

109
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,630
Will my brother come here?

110
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,480
I'm so scared.

111
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,430
Are you the second daughter of Gangcheng's Jiang family, Jiang Yingxian?

112
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,190
You investigated my identity?

113
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,160
We kidnapped you because we know who you are.

114
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,240
We have contacted the Jiang family.

115
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,240
If the Jiang family is willing to pay us,

116
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,390
we won't

117
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,190
cause you any trouble.

118
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,600
How can I eat

119
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:42,680
with my hands tied?

120
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,440
If I starve to death,

121
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,600
do you think you can get a single cent?

122
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,390
What?

123
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,750
Do you think I can beat you in a fight?

124
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,190
I'm sure you can't escape.

125
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,560
Don't try anything funny.

126
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:22,950
They clearly know who I am.

127
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:29,800
Yes.

128
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,830
I got them to kidnap you

129
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,750
because you caused my father's death

130
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,000
and took my brother away.

131
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,630
I thought

132
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,040
you revealed my identity because they threatened you.

133
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:47,160
I didn't expect them to be the ones you hired.

134
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,270
You have acquired so much.

135
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,680
Why do you still take things away from me?

136
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,000
Why?

137
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,040
Are you crazy, Jiang Yingxian?

138
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:02,950
Help!

139
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:03,870
She's trying to kill me.

140
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,630
Help me.

141
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,480
She tried to kill me.

142
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:09,600
If I die,

143
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,870
all of you will never get paid.

144
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:12,510
I didn't.

145
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,000
Don't cause any trouble.

146
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,480
We won't forgive you

147
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:16,800
if we don't get paid.

148
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:17,680
I...

149
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,870
I didn't do anything.

150
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:26,920
Open the door!

151
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,510
Jiang Yingxian!

152
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:35,910
Major,

153
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,870
we've driven for so long

154
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,320
but we haven't seen anyone.

155
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:41,270
Perhaps your sister didn't take the main road

156
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,480
and used the mountain path instead.

157
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:43,720
Are there

158
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,670
any ferocious beasts

159
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:45,840
or bandits around the mountains?

160
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,320
There aren't any beasts,

161
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,360
but it's a chaotic time now.

162
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,550
There are many people

163
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,150
who can't survive and become bandits.

164
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:53,790
All right.

165
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,480
Don't look around.

166
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:08,240
Move.

167
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:11,670
Ba!

168
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,630
Take a look at her.

169
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:15,790
Don't let her get infected and die.

170
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,030
Otherwise, we would lose a lot.

171
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:20,960
Where's your wound?

172
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,320
Ba.

173
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,600
Hurry.

174
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,080
Come.

175
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:42,030
There were so many mines buried behind the mountains.

176
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,150
Didn't you know that?

177
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,750
Why did you still go there?

178
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,390
Hold it!

179
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,320
Major,

180
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,750
I didn't find her.

181
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,600
We'll search the mountain path.

182
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,510
Split up.

183
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,510
Yes, Major.

184
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:11,960
- Stop! - Stop!

185
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,120
Don't run!

186
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:13,600
Don't run!

187
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:14,120
Stop!

188
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:14,750
After her!

189
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:17,150
Stop!

190
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:17,840
Wait!

191
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:19,550
We haven't scouted

192
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:20,910
the forest ahead.

193
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,790
I don't know if there are any mines.

194
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,200
Should we watch her escape and do nothing?

195
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:27,080
We'll take a detour.

196
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:28,480
If she can escape the forest,

197
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,750
we'll catch her.

198
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,670
This area should be between Haicheng and Gangcheng.

199
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,550
I asked Fu Cheng to help Fu Zhi before this.

200
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,960
I should be able to meet Fu Cheng sooner

201
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,360
if I head towards Haicheng.

202
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,120
She's over there!

203
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:55,840
Hold it.

204
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,200
I think she stepped on a mine.

205
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:58,720
How unlucky.

206
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,030
What should we do?

207
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:00,630
Forget about her.

208
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,030
She stepped on a mine.

209
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,440
She'll still lose a limb or two if she survives.

210
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,910
We can't get any money for her.

211
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:06,720
Let's go.

212
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,480
Yes.

213
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,080
Zhi!

214
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,790
Zhi!

215
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:56,550
Fu Zhi!

216
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,440
Zhi!

217
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:02,600
Zhi!

218
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,030
Fu Zhi!

219
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:05,960
Fu Cheng.

220
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:14,870
Yingxian.

221
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:19,790
Why are you here?

222
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:20,480
Don't come here.

223
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:25,320
I think I stepped on a mine.

224
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:34,670
Don't move.

225
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,670
Don't be afraid.

226
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:02,910
Is it a mine?

227
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,720
Yes.

228
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:16,630
How unexpected.

229
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,240
I've been pursuing fame and fortune for 20 years

230
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,390
but this is how I end up.

231
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:24,240
Yingxian,

232
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:25,630
listen to me.

233
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,150
You should go.

234
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,600
Later, I'll take your place.

235
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,030
Stay as far away as possible

236
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,550
and protect yourself.

237
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,630
You'll take my place?

238
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:40,840
What will you do?

239
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:47,960
Don't worry.

240
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,000
Homemade mines

241
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,550
are inaccurate.

242
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,000
There will be a delay of a second or two when it explodes.

243
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,480
If I can run away quickly,

244
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,480
only my legs will get hurt.

245
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:01,600
Do you believe me?

246
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,550
I believe you.

247
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:35,270
Fu Cheng.

248
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:36,960
Take cover.

249
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:44,480
Fu Cheng.

250
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:45,240
I've taken cover.

251
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:55,670
I'm going to jump!

252
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,600
Three! Two!

253
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:00,960
One!

254
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,240
Fu Cheng!

255
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,360
Fu Cheng!

256
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,550
It's all right.

257
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,000
It's all right.

258
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:35,910
Didn't I tell you?

259
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,480
This is the thing I am experiencing every day?

260
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,510
Is this the life you've chosen?

261
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,440
Sacrificing your life to help warlords take over each other's turfs.

262
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,910
You can just die at some random place

263
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,510
with no one to remember you when you die, right?

264
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:53,720
Do you care about me then?

265
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,720
I thought you'd really die just now.

266
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,510
I thought I could no longer see you again.
