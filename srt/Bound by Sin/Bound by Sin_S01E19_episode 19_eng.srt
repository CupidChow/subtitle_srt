 ♫ Drifting aimlessly Not knowing where to go ♫

00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:37,440
 ♫ The moonlight tonight feels sorrowful ♫ 

4
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:42,680
 ♫ I stand alone against it ♫ 

5
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,880
 ♫ But I don't want to ♫

00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:51,880
 ♫ The longing catches me off guard ♫ 

7

 ♫ To the silent night, I surrender myself ♫

 ♫ Tossing and turning, lost in confusion In the darkness, I lose my way ♫

12
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:51,480
I've already had people tell the Jiang family that you're safe.

13
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,840
Everything is fine on their end too.

14
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,899
Fu Cheng, are you really not coming with me?

15
00:01:59,639 --> 00:02:01,239
Yingxian.

16
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,339
I know you care about me, and I'm happy about that.

17
00:02:06,339 --> 00:02:08,350
But right now,

18
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:13,519
amid all this chaos, the only way to protect our homeland

19
00:02:13,519 --> 00:02:16,600
and our families is by joining the military.

20
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,020
My family can...

21
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,080
Yingxian, if we can't fight to unite

22
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,430
and protect the country,

23
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,880
rich families like yours will eventually become prey, waiting to be slaughtered.

24
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,499
Yingxian, trust me.

25
00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:54,619
A peaceful era will come, where farmers have land to work,

26
00:02:55,239 --> 00:02:57,610
students have schools to attend,

27
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:00,600
and merchants can trade freely.

28
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,600
When that time comes, we'll never be apart again.

29
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,319
That's all too far away.

30
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:13,440
I just want you to live.

31
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,160
I just want us to live.

32
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,760
Brother!

33
00:03:19,721 --> 00:03:21,821
What are you doing here?

34
00:03:30,399 --> 00:03:34,920
Had I not been here, how would you have been saved so soon?

35
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,399
Brother, she's lying.

36
00:03:37,399 --> 00:03:42,020
She left me in the bandits' den and ran off herself.

37
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,220
I've said what I needed to.

38
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:50,100
You handle the rest.

39
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:53,559
Stay here with me.

40
00:03:53,559 --> 00:03:56,209
Aren't you going to talk to your little sister alone?

41
00:03:56,209 --> 00:03:58,968
There's nothing I need to hide from you.

42
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,100
- Brother... 
 - Xiao Zhi.

43
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:12,000
I'll never forget what Uncle Fu did for me all these years,

44
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,860
so I'll never leave you behind.

45
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,799
But you're an adult now.

46
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:20,539
You need to take responsibility for your actions.

47
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:22,920
I'll give you some money.

48
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:27,359
Take it, and find a safe place to live.

49
00:04:27,359 --> 00:04:30,779
Brother, what's that supposed to mean?

50
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:32,439
I'm just a young girl.

51
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:34,140
With the war going on everywhere,

52
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:37,419
even if you give me money, how will I survive on my own?

53
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:45,253
If you don't want to be alone, you can come to my place.

54
00:04:45,253 --> 00:04:47,439
I'll give you a job that suits you.

55
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:50,280
Why should I be your servant?

56
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,280
Brother, you promised to take care of me for life.

57
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,020
- You promised! 
 - Xiao Zhi, I can only take care of you

58
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,359
the way a brother takes care of his little sister.

59
00:04:59,359 --> 00:05:00,879
Do you understand?

60
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:04,380
It's always been that way, and it'll never change.

61
00:05:05,355 --> 00:05:07,614
I don't understand!

62
00:05:51,471 --> 00:05:53,480
Tomorrow is Chinese New Year's Eve.

63
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,960
Do you want to stay and celebrate together?

64
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,920
Sure.

65
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,679
This will be our first New Year together.

66
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,455
- Come on. 
 - Let's have a drink together.

67
00:06:06,455 --> 00:06:07,600
- Here. 
 - Cheers.

68
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,100
- Cheers, everyone. 
 - Cheers.

69
00:06:12,159 --> 00:06:15,559
Are you comrades from the Pingcheng Red Cross?

70
00:06:15,559 --> 00:06:18,580
Yes. The snow up north delayed us by two days.

71
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,539
Nice to meet you.

72
00:06:20,539 --> 00:06:24,539
You came just in time. We're celebrating New Year's Eve right now.

73
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:28,260
Everyone, quiet down for a second.

74
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:31,180
Let me introduce to you all our comrades from the Pingcheng Red Cross.

75
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,640
They've come to support us.

76
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,659
- Give them a warm welcome! 
 - Awesome!

77
00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:36,980
- Hurray! 
 - Welcome!

78
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,299
All right, that's enough. This way, please.

79
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:53,160
Where's the wine? Come on.

80
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,600
- Let's drink. 
 - Cheers.

81
00:07:07,565 --> 00:07:09,500
Sister!

82
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,779
Sister, what are you doing here?

83
00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:13,280
I got injured a few days ago.

84
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,700
Luckily, Major Fu rescued me, and I followed him back to the camp.

85
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,720
I'll be returning to Gangcheng tomorrow. What about you?

86
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,840
Weren't you supposed to be in school? Why did you join the military?

87
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,659
After I got back to Pingcheng, I joined the Pingcheng Red Cross.

88
00:07:23,659 --> 00:07:25,899
I've learned a lot about medicine there.

89
00:07:25,899 --> 00:07:28,920
Now, we're here to offer assistance.

90
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,480
It's too dangerous to join the military now.

91
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,400
Why don't you head to Gangcheng with me tomorrow?

92
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,759
I'll send you abroad to study with Yingqi.

93
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:40,960
Sister, I know staying here is dangerous,

94
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,040
but the army needs us, and the people of Haicheng need us too.

95
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,480
Let the soldiers fight the war. You're still young.

96
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,920
You should go somewhere safe and focus on your studies.

97
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:53,160
Sister, why didn't you go abroad with Yingqi?

98
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,219
Why are you staying in Gangcheng?

99
00:07:56,219 --> 00:07:58,119
I...

100
00:07:58,119 --> 00:08:02,940
I know your goal has always been to become the head of the Jiang family.

101
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,610
So, as the family head, naturally,

102
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:08,060
you need to be with the Jiang family in times of crisis.

103
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,600
Am I right, Sister?

104
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,219
Though staying in Gangcheng isn't as safe as going abroad,

105
00:08:13,219 --> 00:08:15,759
it's still safer than being on the battlefield.

106
00:08:16,715 --> 00:08:22,439
Sister, I know you're worried about me, but this is what I want to do.

107
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:25,720
I've worked hard to join the Red Cross.

108
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:30,099
I want to contribute to my country.

109
00:08:30,099 --> 00:08:34,160
Even if I end up sacrificing my life,
it would be an honor.

110
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,699
You think it's an honor to sacrifice yourself?

111
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:54,780
Why are you still up?

112
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:57,640
We've got a long journey ahead tomorrow.

113
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,679
Get some rest.

114
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:02,240
How about we stay up together tonight?

115
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,960
Alright. Let's wish for safety,

116
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:12,079
health, and good fortune in the new year.

117
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,640
Yingsi told me earlier

118
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:24,940
that she'd be willing to give her life for her country if it came to that.

119
00:09:25,659 --> 00:09:29,839
It made me wonder, do you feel the same way?

120
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,859
Not a day goes by that I don't wish for the war to end soon

121
00:09:34,859 --> 00:09:40,920
so I can make it to the day
when a new world and new life arrive.

122
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,599
It will happen.

123
00:09:43,319 --> 00:09:45,160
It definitely will.

124
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:01,400
Don't worry about me, Sister.

125
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,280
Just go.

126
00:10:21,219 --> 00:10:23,760
If you run into trouble, come find me in Gangcheng.

127
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,319
Our door will always be open to you.

128
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,100
Something seems off up ahead.

129
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,959
- Go and see what's going on.
- Got it.

130
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,380
Brother, stop the truck.

131
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,160
Excuse me. What's going on up ahead?

132
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,059
Sir, I haven't done anything wrong!

133
00:11:07,059 --> 00:11:09,440
I don't have any money, either!

134
00:11:11,599 --> 00:11:13,520
Don't be afraid, sir.

135
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:15,760
Are you from Gangcheng?

136
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:20,240
These people all fled from Gangcheng.

137
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,400
What happened in Gangcheng?

138
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:26,400
Last night, Governor Jin and Commander Chen got into a fight.

139
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,980
It's said that Commander Chen got killed.

140
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:32,079
The city's in chaos, and a lot of people have died.

141
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,920
Sir, do you know if the Jiang family is okay?

142
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,760
How would we common folk know what's going on with those rich families?

143
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,850
But I've heard that several mansions have been surrounded

144
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:44,260
by soldiers sent by Governor Jin.

145
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,439
Sister-in-law, maybe you should come back to the camp with us.

146
00:11:52,439 --> 00:11:55,659
We don't know what's going on in Gangcheng right now.

147
00:11:55,659 --> 00:11:58,520
No, I need to get into the city.

148
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:02,439
At a time like this, if I, the head of the family, am not there with my family,

149
00:12:02,439 --> 00:12:05,920
I'm not sure if they can survive.

150
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,439
I'll go with you.

151
00:12:10,319 --> 00:12:14,799
You head back, and report the situation in Gangcheng to the higher-ups.

152
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:18,020
Major, it's too dangerous to go into the city now.

153
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:21,579
Don't worry. We're just merchants.

154
00:12:21,579 --> 00:12:23,280
I'm sure if we offer enough money,

155
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,260
whether it's Governor Jin or anyone else,

156
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,470
they won't give us too much trouble.

157
00:12:28,199 --> 00:12:31,260
All right. I'll report back as soon as possible.

158
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,660
Go ahead.

00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:14,630
 ♫ What can I do for you? Please, tell me ♫ 

163
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:20,490
 ♫ I won't speak, but I know there's so much ♫ 

164
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:23,970
 ♫ You hesitate to tell me ♫ 

165
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:29,930
 ♫ Why are there tears in your eyes? ♫ 

166
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:34,340
 ♫ Everything I say seems wrong ♫ 

167
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:37,880
 ♫ All I can do is listen, as you go on ♫ 

168
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:46,760
 ♫ Let me hear about your life with him ♫ 

169
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:55,800
 ♫ Your tears hidden behind the mask, they dim But you still love, even if it's not real ♫ 

170
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:01,280
 ♫ Real lies, and you can't tell what's at stake ♫ 

171
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,560
 ♫ All right ♫ 

172
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:08,260
 ♫ I'll feel blue in this love
and look at it from a different angle ♫ 

173
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:16,420
 ♫ Offering my shoulder, so you won't feel alone ♫ 

174
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:33,310
 ♫ The more I care, the more it aches ♫ 

175
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:36,950
 ♫ We all make mistakes, and that's how we learn ♫ 

176
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:45,930
 ♫ Me staying quiet shows how much I yearn ♫ 

177
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:54,960
 ♫ Your tears hidden behind the mask, they dim But you still love, even if it's not real ♫ 

178
00:14:54,960 --> 00:15:00,220
 ♫ It's not that I'm insecure,
but I feel I'm to blame ♫ 

179
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,590
 ♫ All right ♫ 

180
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:05,190
 ♫ I'm the silent third wheel in this game ♫ 

181
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:09,400
 ♫ How pathetic I appear ♫
