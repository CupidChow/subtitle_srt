1
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,752
 

2
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,040
Mr. Shen.

3
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,840
It seems I have some urgent business to attend to,
so I won't see you off.

4
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,200
Isn't this Xu Ya Wei's bodyguard?

5
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,599
What's going on with you guys?

6
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,839
Something that's not very nice to talk about.

7
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,680
About the Jiang family.

8
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,359
Jiang Ying Xian.
I hope it is really about the Jiang family.

9
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:48,320
Otherwise, you don't want your father
to take back your power, do you?

10
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,599
I have things to do. See you later.

11
00:00:54,599 --> 00:00:56,319
Call me anytime.

12
00:00:56,319 --> 00:00:57,759
I will.

13
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,159
Come in with me.

14
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,319
Sit down.

15
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:48,879
 If it's really him, it'll be fun. 

16
00:01:51,639 --> 00:01:53,640
It's a beautiful day.

17
00:02:07,639 --> 00:02:09,199
Do you like it?

18
00:02:11,401 --> 00:02:16,321
I think this color goes well with you.

19
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:24,320
I chose it especially for you.

20
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,520
You...

21
00:02:33,359 --> 00:02:36,800
Actually, I've always been a bit curious...

22
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:48,159
about what a decent and tough guy like you
looks like when you are pleasing women.

23
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,439
Shen Dong Yang woke me up early in the morning.

24
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,160
So I'm sleepy now.
I'd like to get some sleep.

25
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,720
Mr. Fu.

26
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:04,319
Make yourself at home.

27
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,759
Jiang Ying Xian!

28
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:28,000
 What exactly does she want? 

29
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:47,680
Cheng. This time, we must fulfill all our
vengeance, and take back what we've lost.

30
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,759
I cuffed you, so you really didn't move?

31
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,119
Two hours.

32
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,399
You have a lot of stamina.

33
00:04:05,399 --> 00:04:07,120
Is this fun?

34
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:11,240
Yes, it is.

35
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,720
Are you angry?

36
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,640
Don't give in too quickly.

37
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,599
Otherwise, I'll lose the fun quickly.

38
00:04:26,372 --> 00:04:28,771
What do you want?

39
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:33,239
What do I want?

40
00:04:34,799 --> 00:04:38,799
The disenchantment of the prodigal,
and the fall of a saint.

41
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:42,919
Isn't that what the world loves to see?

42
00:04:46,999 --> 00:04:53,999
And I love to see the struggles of humanity,

43
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:01,440
especially that of somebody like you
who seems nobler than me.

44
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:10,320
Hold me.

45
00:05:17,799 --> 00:05:19,559
Come and hold me.

46
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,576
 ♫ The picture's yellowed ♫ 

47
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,559
 ♫ But it can't dim ♫ 

48
00:05:35,559 --> 00:05:37,525
Take me to the bathroom.

49
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:49,146
 ♫ It's like a handbook of memories ♫ 

50
00:05:49,146 --> 00:05:56,478
 ♫ Of what we've done ♫ 

51
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,168
 ♫ The glass is tinkling ♫ 

52
00:06:01,001 --> 00:06:03,565
 ♫ You got an unnatural look ♫ 

53
00:06:03,565 --> 00:06:08,835
 ♫ Of panic on your face ♫ 

54
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:18,086
 He showered before he came,
so he knows what he's here for. 

55
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,400
Afraid of me?

56
00:06:27,359 --> 00:06:28,880
Run the water.

57
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,834
It's freezing.

58
00:06:31,834 --> 00:06:33,511
 ♫ I'll stop ♫ 

59
00:06:33,511 --> 00:06:41,256
 ♫ And tear down my pretense of modesty. ♫ 

60
00:06:44,799 --> 00:06:46,978
 Does he really think I feel cold? 

61
00:06:49,129 --> 00:06:55,867
 ♫ I'm glad I can love and hate you ♫ 

62
00:06:55,867 --> 00:06:59,913
 ♫ I kiss you softly amidst the prosperousness ♫ 

63
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,239
I usually put a little rose petal in the bathtub.

64
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,919
I forget who gave it to me.

65
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:15,640
You know there are always men
who pester me and send me flowers.

66
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,174
This is what Shen Dong Yang gave you earlier,
isn't it?

67
00:07:23,204 --> 00:07:26,640
 ♫ You and I are humming softly ♫ 

68
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:30,907
 ♫ We can't let such a nice night go by ♫ 

69
00:07:30,907 --> 00:07:34,279
 ♫ After tonight, we'll be gone ♫ 

70
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:41,113
 ♫ And on our own ♫ 

71
00:07:42,136 --> 00:07:45,486
 ♫ Drifting aimlessly ♫ 

72
00:07:45,486 --> 00:07:48,636
 ♫ Not knowing where to go ♫ 

73
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:51,986
The water's hot.

74
00:07:55,706 --> 00:07:59,126
 ♫ I stand alone against it ♫ 

75
00:07:59,126 --> 00:08:01,326
 ♫ But I don't want to ♫ 

76
00:08:01,326 --> 00:08:07,896
 ♫ The longing catches me off guard ♫ 

77
00:08:09,436 --> 00:08:15,326
 ♫ To the silent night, I surrender myself ♫ 

78
00:08:16,406 --> 00:08:17,906
 ♫ Tossing and turning, lost in confusion ♫ 

79
00:08:17,906 --> 00:08:26,896
 ♫ In the darkness, I lose my way ♫ 

80
00:08:37,439 --> 00:08:39,200
Take me to bed.

81
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:51,083
 ♫ The music plays in the city's churches ♫ 

82
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:57,387
 ♫ I should've been with you forever ♫ 

83
00:08:57,387 --> 00:09:00,998
 ♫ But it can't last when there's chaos ♫ 

84
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:04,799
 ♫ And when I look back,
there is just rubble and empty alleys ♫ 

85
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:08,440
You dropped me so hard.
You're not doing a very good job as a bodyguard.

86
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:13,599
If you just needed a bodyguard,
you wouldn't have to spend so much money.

87
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:24,440
But a bodyguard can't do this.

88
00:09:31,479 --> 00:09:34,279
Turn off the light. I need to sleep.

89
00:09:44,319 --> 00:09:50,560
 If he's really Jiang Ying Si,
will he fall in love with his half-sister? 

90
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:08,920
Boss. At Jiangbei Village,
we expect to open next month.

91
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,439
Got it.

92
00:10:11,439 --> 00:10:14,680
Mr. Shen was really helpful this time.

93
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,040
Indeed.

94
00:10:21,199 --> 00:10:23,120
 As long as you're willing to help in this matter, 

95
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,920
 I'll give you 10% of the profit
from your shipment through Jiang's Dock. 

96
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,319
Ying Xian.

97
00:10:28,319 --> 00:10:34,560
Based on our relationship,
even without this 10%, I will definitely help you.

98
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,760
Even if you borrow Master Shen's connections,

99
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,400
 you still need to pay someone to handle it, 

100
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:46,280
 so no matter how,
I can't let you lose out on that, right? 

101
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:51,479
Besides, how can friendship be stronger
than a relationship of interest?

102
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:57,479
I'm sure I'll make a solid profit
doing business with you.

103
00:10:57,479 --> 00:10:59,520
As long as you're willing to help.

104
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,440
Okay.
I'll give you an answer in a few days.

105
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,040
Stop.

106
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,160
 Stop what? 

107
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,079
 I just want you to have fun. 

108
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:10,639
 Are you happy? 

109
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:15,639
I won't spoil your fun.
I'll wait for your message.

110
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,320
She hung up.

111
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,239
Jiang Ying Xian is jealous?

112
00:11:33,719 --> 00:11:35,560
How can that be?

113
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,001
Dong Yang.

114
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,520
Come on. Put it on.

115
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,720
I'll stay here tonight.

116
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:12,880
I used to think you always gave me new clothes
because you liked me,

117
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,440
but I didn't realize you just wanted me
to dress up like her to please you.

118
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,240
You jerk!

119
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,239
Uninhibited.

120
00:12:31,719 --> 00:12:33,639
Shen Dong Yang!

121
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:44,199
By the way, keep an eye on what Jiang Ying Qi
is doing these days.

122
00:12:44,199 --> 00:12:47,160
He's been weirdly quiet these days.

123
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,999
Mr. Ying Qi seems to be
at the Dance Hall all the time lately.

124
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,519
He may be up to some tricks again.

125
00:12:56,719 --> 00:12:59,760
Any news from the North?

126
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,840
It's been too long, so there's no clue.

127
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,680
Then keep investigating Fu Cheng.

128
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,319
Boss, don't forget how your brother
ended up in this position.

129
00:13:14,319 --> 00:13:21,839
He's the eldest son, educated enough, competent,
ten years older than you, and a worthy successor,

130
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,199
but he made such a mistake with his marriage

131
00:13:24,199 --> 00:13:27,520
that he insisted on marrying
a female performer with a bad reputation.

132
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,240
Master was so angry
he didn't even show up on the wedding day.

133
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,720
I know.

134
00:13:33,439 --> 00:13:35,559
It's because of my brother's falling out
with my father

135
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:39,960
and his gradual marginalization in the business
world that I've been given this opportunity.

136
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,959
Don't worry.

137
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,370
I'm not a playgirl.

138
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:48,810
Some things can only be a pastime.

139
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:59,240
The people who have been investigating you
in your hometown may be from the Jiang family.

140
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:03,799
The Jiang family's second daughter is still young,
but she's a tough one.

141
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:06,319
She has recently snatched the project
in Jiangbei Village

142
00:14:06,319 --> 00:14:08,479
that the Jiang family's oldest son
was in charge of.

143
00:14:08,479 --> 00:14:13,399
Now she takes care of most
of the important business of the Jiang family.

144
00:14:17,719 --> 00:14:21,639
She is a strange person.

145
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:27,400
She is not only thoughtful
but also so unpredictable

146
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:31,559
that it's hard,
for people to figure out what she's up to.

147
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:35,439
We should be careful with this woman,

148
00:14:35,439 --> 00:14:39,839
but if we succeed,
the whole Jiang family will be in our hands.

149
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:47,080
But I always felt that she was testing me
rather than being interested in me.

150
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,720
I don't know...

151
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,320
which one of us is the prey in the end.

152
00:15:02,764 --> 00:15:08,959
My brother is disobedient, and married to
a woman from a family that doesn't match ours,

153
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,079
so my father definitely can't let him
run the Jiang family.

154
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:20,040
My sister is very capable,
but she is a girl after all.

155
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:24,799
If the Jiang family is under her control,
the whole family will have another family name,

156
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:28,920
so the Jiang family will be mine.

157
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:32,640
Director Yu. Tomorrow we're going
to start construction at Jiangbei Village.

158
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,440
Please come with me to the ribbon cutting.

159
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:41,160
You're always reliable.

160
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:49,640
If Shen Dong Yang hadn't gotten there first,

161
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:55,519
I would have asked Master Jiang
for permission to marry you.

162
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,399
You're flattering me.

163
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:04,400
- Come on. Drink more.
- Director Yu, let's make a deal.

164
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,319
I'll see you tomorrow.

165
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:07,840
See you tomorrow.

166
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,680
- Come on.
- Mr. Jiang.

167
00:16:23,464 --> 00:16:26,280
Ying Xian? Why are you here?

168
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,439
Miss Xu. I'm sorry. I'm drunk.

169
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:31,800
Can I borrow a driver from you?

170
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:39,199
It's rare for Miss Jiang
to turn to uneducated people like us.

171
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,040
See my bodyguard?

172
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,000
Handsome, isn't he?

173
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,239
Give me a thousand. You can have him.

174
00:16:49,444 --> 00:16:51,877
 

175
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:53,479
Thanks a lot.
