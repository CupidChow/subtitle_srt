Fu Cheng!

13
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,000
Zhi,

14
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,040
what are you doing here?

15
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,560
Where were you, Cheng?

16
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,510
Go.

17
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,760
Come back soon.

18
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,360
Let's go.

19
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,470
Zhi.

20
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,240
How is your father doing?

21
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,190
He's no longer with us.

22
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,590
When did that happen?

23
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,750
Shortly after you left Gangcheng,

24
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,560
he...

25
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,630
I don't know what got into him

26
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,360
which made him feel hopeless.

27
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,000
Moreover, a few days before he passed away,

28
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,430
he kept saying that he failed you.

29
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,030
Fu Cheng,

30
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,240
what did my father do?

31
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,710
Zhi,

32
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,960
it's my fault.

33
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,630
I shouldn't have...

34
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:57,630
Cheng,

35
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,150
where have you been in the past few months?

36
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,150
I couldn't find you at all.

37
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,240
All I could do was wait for you near Jiang's Trading Company every day.

38
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,470
And today, you finally appeared.

39
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:09,750
I...

40
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,470
I was away from Gangcheng for the past few months.

41
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:14,520
I only came back yesterday.

42
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:23,590
Did Miss Jiang send you away for work?

43
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,000
No.

44
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,710
I joined the army.

45
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:30,030
Did you come back now to bring me with you?

46
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,400
Zhi,

47
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,590
there are many rules in the army,

48
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:37,840
so I...

49
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,840
But I have been

50
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,630
all alone for the past few months.

51
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,630
I have no one to rely on.

52
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,280
I was hoping to find you.

53
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,000

00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:46,870

55
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:47,750
You know what?

56
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,750
I'll think of a solution.

57
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,030
Mr. Fu. Miss Fu.

58
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,030
Let me handle the luggage.

This way, please.

62
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,430
am I staying here for real?

63
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,190
The guest room has been cleaned.

64
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,560
You can place your luggage there now.

65
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,240
I have to head to the company.

66
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,920
Come and find me once you settle down.

67
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,160
Tell the driver not to drive so fast.

68
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,000
Stay safe.

69
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:55,800
See you.

Let's check out the guest room.

72
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,120
Come.

73
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,120
Cheng,

74
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,870
why must I stay here?

75
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,720
I'm scared.

76
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,040
Gangcheng hasn't been a safe place recently.

77
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,750
I have to travel soon in a few days.

78
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,920
Staying with the Jiangs means you can

79
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:24,120
look after each other

80
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,310
when something happens.

81
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,480
Cheng,

82
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:30,070
are you seeing Miss Jiang now?

83
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,120
Once the dust settles,

84
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,920
I will propose to her.

85
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,430
But

86
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,720
I'm not sure

87
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,480
if she'll say yes.

88
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,120
I see.

89
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:01,600
Boss,

90
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,720
I have retrieved the bespoke ring you ordered.

91
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,120
Boss,

92
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,870
are you truly proposing to Fu Cheng soon?

93
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:11,950
Yes.

94
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,950
I want to make it official.

95
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:15,310
That way,

96
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,120
he won't have second thoughts about my genuine feelings.

97
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:18,800
Boss,

98
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,190
I know you are now

99
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,830
the head of the Jiang family.

100
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,070
You have annulled your marital arrangement with Shen Dongyang.

101
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,750
And you're no longer under Master's thumb.

102
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,560
But Fu Cheng is not...

103
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,800
I know what you're about to say.

104
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,360
However, whether it was at Jiangbei Village

105
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,240
or Haicheng,

106
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:34,920
without Fu Cheng,

107
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,600
we wouldn't have been able

108
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,950
to have this conversation here.

109
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:38,920
Boss.

110
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,800
I understand you have feelings.

111
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
But have you entertained the notion

112
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,390
that perhaps, he was just doing his job?

113
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:44,920
It's not you.

114
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,390
If it was another Zhang Yingxian

115
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,070
or Li Yingxian,

116
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,070
he'd save her nonetheless.

117
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,480
He didn't perform the act because of you.

118
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,120
He did it out of a sense of duty.

119
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,430
You said once

120
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,190
that he mentioned he'd save

121
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,240
any of his peers

122
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,240
in Haicheng.

123
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,720
That's why I fell for him.

124
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,310
I don't understand.

125
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:06,750
Love isn't just about fidelity.

126
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,120
Anyone can temporarily turn

127
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,870
into an amazing lover under the influence

128
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:13,750
of desires.

129
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,160
That is a performance.

130
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:17,870
It is the best of what a person can do intentionally.

131
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,630
I'm not a romantic.

132
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,070
Compared to what a person intends to do,

133
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:24,160
I'd rather believe what a person does naturally.

134
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,720
Yes, you're right, Boss.

135
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:31,120
But didn't you always say

136
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:33,510
that love only played

137
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:34,830
a small part in life?

138
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,800
Once the infatuation fades away,

139
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,630
the greatest value a partner can provide

140
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,870
isn't his emotional support,

141
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,480
but joint profitability.

142
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:47,360
Yes.

143
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:49,750
However,

144
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,240
it's a chaotic time now.

145
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:54,510
No one knows

146
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,630
what the future holds.

147
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,510
I've been thinking lately.

148
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,630
Perhaps profits

149
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,190
aren't the most important thing in life.

150
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:06,870
You know

151
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,360
that I've been reining in my family business.

152
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,920
It's not because of Shen Dongyang,

153
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,240
but because of the current circumstances.

154
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,240
Still, Boss,

155
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,600
even if Fu Cheng is the right man,

156
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,070
a woman shouldn't be the one proposing.

157
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:23,480
Isn't it the man's job?

158
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:27,070
There shouldn't be a rule regarding who should propose first.

159
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,630
Get everything ready.

160
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,600
What are you working on?

161
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:51,670
Do you need my help?

162
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,150
No need, Miss Fu.

163
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,240
Just focus on your work.

164
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,480
Miss Ke said

165
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:57,360
that there'd be a huge announcement

166
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,360
once Miss Jiang and Mr. Fu returned

167
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,750
from the church.

168
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,030
She asked us to decorate the place.

169
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,670
I see.

170
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:04,360
Don't let me keep you here.

171
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,120
Wait for me here.

172
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,910
I'm going inside to get something.

173
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,390
Inside the church?

174
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:35,870
At this dangerous time,

175
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,750
the church provides a good hiding spot.

176
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,080
Go ahead.

177
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:46,630
I'll wait for you here.

178
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:14,790
Yingxian!

179
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,080
Don't just stand there.

180
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,440
I've been waiting for you.

181
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,720
I thought it wouldn't take you too long to barge in.

182
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,550
Who would have thought that you could hold yourself back this long?

183
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,720
Yingxian.

184
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,600
Mr. Fu Cheng,

185
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,240
would you like to marry Miss Jiang Yingxian?

186
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:38,910
