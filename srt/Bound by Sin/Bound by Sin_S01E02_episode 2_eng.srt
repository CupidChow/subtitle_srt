1
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:19,900
 

2
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,719
Sir, you can't go in.

3
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:31,959
Please...

4
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,060
Fu Cheng, how is your sister?

5
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:42,120
My dad asked me to check on her.

6
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,999
Miss Xu, did Mr. Xu agree to advance my salary?

7
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,399
This is all that's left.

8
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,260
I've been short on cash lately,
and Dad has reduced my allowance,

9
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,679
so I'm borrowing from you to get by.

10
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,440
- Miss Xu, how can you do this?
- Why can't I?

11
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,839
Who do you think you are?

12
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:25,220
You're just a lowly, insignificant man,
a worthless ex-soldier.

13
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:30,559
You should be grateful my family
even gave you a job.

14
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,959
Hello, Mr. Fu.

15
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,580
Sorry to bother you at this time,

16
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,500
but the sooner we agree on
how to handle your sister's situation,

17
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,839
the better it will be for all of us.

18
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,020
Apologies, Miss Xu,

19
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,879
but we have some private matters to discuss,
so please excuse us.

20
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:08,779
We just want you to refrain
from dragging the Jiang family into this.

21
00:02:08,779 --> 00:02:11,730
If you think these conditions are acceptable,

22
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,590
we're open to whatever amount seems fair.

23
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,519
Please leave.

24
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,832
Mr. Fu, as far as I know,
things aren't looking good for your sister.

25
00:02:25,832 --> 00:02:28,240
After the surgery, she'll need to stay
in the hospital for a long time.

26
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:34,499
She'll need plenty of money,
for medication and rehabilitation.

27
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,840
 

28
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,799
I'll figure it out myself.

29
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,780
Mr. Fu, here's my business card.
 

30
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,560
You can contact me if you need anything.

31
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,640
Right now, it's me who has something to ask of you,

32
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,170
and the initiative is in your hands.

33
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:12,519
But when you come looking for me,
our positions will change.

34
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,380
 

35
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,330
 

36
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:54,179
Well then, Mr. Fu, goodbye.

37
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,900
 

38
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,900
If I were on his side,
I'd admire his dignity and integrity,

39
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,770
but my job is to clean up Mr. Ying Qi's mess,

40
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:16,840
so his stubbornness is really giving me a headache.

41
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:21,200
Just wait. I've seen many
self-righteous people like him.

42
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,760
Once he comes to his senses, he'll come to me.

43
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,800
Every time Mr. Ying Qi gets into trouble,
you have to clean up after him.

44
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,980
And he just keeps creating problems.

45
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:33,040
Helping him is also helping myself.

46
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:39,759
If Ying Jian finds out and tells Father about it,
I'll definitely be implicated.

47
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:40,920
Master Jiang is such an old-fashioned man.

48
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,680
He clearly knows
you're the one keeping the Trading Company.

49
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,440
But he just won't let you take charge
just because you're a woman.

50
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,040
As long as I don't make mistakes, I will
become the head of the family sooner or later.

51
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,950
I will become the head of the family sooner or later.

52
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,080
 

53
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:09,100
Wait here. I'll go get your medicine.

54
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,870
Cheng...

55
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,060
Cheng,

56
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,620
I've figured everything out.
 

57
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,990
It's time for us to head back to Gangcheng.

58
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,380
Uncle Fu, the country is falling apart.

59
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,520
I don't want to dwell on personal grudges anymore.

60
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,220
Personal grudges?

61
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:31,520
Do you think all these warlords fighting each other

62
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,260
are doing it for the good of the country?

63
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,430
No, it's all for their own selfish gain!

64
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,070
Uncle Fu...

65
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,100
 My original name was Gu Cheng. 

66
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,900
 Twenty years ago, a fire destroyed my family. 

67
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:50,620
 It was Uncle Fu who raised me. 

68
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:55,850
 Whether or not to avenge my family
is certainly not a decision I can make on my own. 

69
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:01,260
 Those rich young ladies
must be so accustomed to humiliating others. 

70
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,930
 I thought she'd be different. 

71
00:06:05,271 --> 00:06:08,900
Ying Xian. 
  

72
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,670
Busy?

73
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,790
Ying Xian, have you looked into that land
I mentioned to you last time?

74
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,100
Ying Jian's been working on that piece
of land in Jiangbei Village for a long time.

75
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:39,670
Don't bother trying to get involved.

76
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,960
It's precisely because he hasn't secured the land
after all this time

77
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:47,800
that we should seize the opportunity
to prove our worth to Father.

78
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:58,670
Ying Xian, I hear Father has been searching for Jiang Ying Si,

79
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:01,800
the son he lost years ago.

80
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:13,310
What do you think will happen if Father
really finds this illegitimate son of his,

81
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:15,970
the one Mother kicked out?

82
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:19,890
Can you still become head of the family?

83
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,360
I doubt it.

84
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:28,920
 

85
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,740
 

86
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:36,790
 Whether or not the Jiang family was the culprit, 
 

87
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,790
 it has nothing to do with her. 

88
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,430
 Besides, 

89
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:43,390
 Zhi really needs money for her treatment. 
 

90
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,670
 Uncle Fu said I should take this chance to get close to her, 

91
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:52,940
 but how should I approach her? 

92
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:14,230
Mr. Fu.

93
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,030
It's been a while.

94
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,500
Have a seat.

95
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:42,880
Miss Jiang, you know why I'm here today, right?

96
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:08,650
You really don't know how to ask for help.

97
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,000
Sorry, that came out wrong.

98
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,640
The offer I made earlier at the hospital
still stands.

99
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,210
Medical fees, healthcare expenses...

100
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:20,920
- And...
- No.

101
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,690
Zhi doesn't need charity.

102
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:26,520
I'm here today to borrow money for her treatment.

103
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:30,180
I will pay you back in full later.

104
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:35,670
Mr. Fu, your word alone won't be enough.

105
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:39,420
I can write an IOU.
And we'll include interest.

106
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,210
Mr. Fu, I'm not short on money.

107
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:44,530
Then what do you need me to do?

108
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,000
What can you do for me?

109
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,240
Anything I'm capable of.

110
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,300
In that case...

111
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,000
how about killing someone for me?

112
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,020
Maybe my eldest brother

113
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:08,980
or my father's illegitimate son.

114
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,590
Just kidding. Don't worry.

115
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:26,930
The world is full of danger,
and the human mind is unpredictable.

116
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:32,550
I just need some precautions.

117
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:38,790
For example, a bit of leverage on you.

118
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,470
Leverage?

119
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:49,220
Mr. Fu, please take off all your clothes.

120
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,310
What did you say?

121
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:53,760
I said, please take off all your clothes.

122
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,920
It's just a precaution. Don't worry.

123
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,900
As long as I don't hear any strange rumors,

124
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:02,880
I'll be the only one who gets to admire these photos.

125
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,070
Miss Jiang, are you out of your mind?

126
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:08,730
Not yet.

127
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,880
This is just a little hobby of mine.

128
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,140
Also, based on my judgment,

129
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:18,590
it seems you value dignity more than wealth.

130
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:22,950
It is you who needs something from me,
so you'd better not haggle.

131
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:27,270
Of course, we can discuss other options,

132
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:29,780
but Fu Zhi might not be able to wait that long.

133
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,640
I'm a man.

134
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:36,388
Even if these photos leak,
it won't affect me at all.

135
00:11:36,388 --> 00:11:38,470
Then why hesitate?

136
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:40,360
Go ahead and undress.

137
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,100
Keep going.

138
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:34,770
Mr. Fu, please spin around twice.

139
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:03,210
Is that enough?

140
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:14,990
Why, in such an embarrassing situation,
would you still...

141
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,258
Stop talking.

142
00:13:18,258 --> 00:13:21,360
What do you think of my lips?

143
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,470
Or do you prefer my legs?

144
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,120
Enough!

145
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:33,300
That's enough, Mr. Fu.

146
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:39,160
It seems pointless to say this now,
but this is just a transaction.

147
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,700
Miss Jiang,

148
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,020
I hope you keep your word.

149
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:51,290
After you leave my office,
Ke Rui will take you to collect the money.

150
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,300
I have a suggestion that
might benefit Miss Fu more.

151
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,350
Would you like to hear it?

152
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:05,900
Although her condition is stable now,
we don't know when she'll wake up.

153
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,950
She needs more professional care.

154
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:12,210
A private sanatorium would be better for her.

155
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:13,550
So, what's the catch?

156
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:16,820
When Xu Ya Wei hit you, what were you thinking?

157
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,450
What?

158
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:21,640
Nothing.

159
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,090
You look down on her.

160
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:26,360
You look down on people like us.

161
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,160
So, is that the catch?

162
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,090
You just wanted to ask me a question?

163
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:33,570
Mr. Fu, you really overestimate yourself.

164
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:36,190
 She didn't force me at any point. 

165
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:40,670
 She just laid out her conditions,
and let me make my own choice. 

166
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,610
 But I don't really have any other options. 

167
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:45,160
So, what's the real catch?

168
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:53,520
I heard you were in the military up north.

169
00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:02,070
Are you interested in working
as my personal bodyguard?

170
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:04,000
It's just a suggestion.

171
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,190
Take some time to think about it
before answering me.

172
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:11,970
Miss Jiang, it shouldn't be hard for you
to find a bodyguard.

173
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:15,790
As I said, it's just a suggestion.

174
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:19,660
Other than that,
you can also be my plaything.

175
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:23,300
- You...
- Alright then, from today onward,

176
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,830
you'll be my personal bodyguard.

177
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,570
- Pleasure working with you.
- You're going too far.

178
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:29,970
Mr. Shen, you can't go in!

179
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,890
Boss.

180
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,680
Jiang Ying Xian,

181
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:05,590
how long are you going to keep playing hard to get?

182
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:10,410
Your family needs me, so stop playing this game.

183
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,120
My dear fiancée.

184
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,590
 

185
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:22,590
For the sake of our families' reputation,

186
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:25,600
I hope you can get rid of

187
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:29,810
some of your little, unimportant habits.

188
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,716
- Miss Jiang.
- Miss Jiang.

189
00:16:37,716 --> 00:16:39,972
Miss Jiang, look at the camera.

190
00:16:39,972 --> 00:16:42,710
- One more shot.
- Miss Jiang.

191
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:46,710
- Look at me, Miss Jiang.
- Miss Jiang.

192
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:54,260
- Greetings, Miss Jiang.
- Miss Jiang.

193
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:57,260
- Miss Jiang, turn around.
- Over here, Miss Jiang.
