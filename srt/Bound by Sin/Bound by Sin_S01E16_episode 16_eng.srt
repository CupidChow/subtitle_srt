2
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,680
 ♫ Drifting aimlessly Not knowing where to go ♫ 

3
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:37,340
 ♫ The moonlight tonight feels sorrowful ♫ 

4
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,780
 ♫ I stand alone against it ♫ 

5
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,980
 ♫ But I don't want to ♫ 

6
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:51,580
 ♫ The longing catches me off guard ♫ 

7
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:59,180
 ♫ To the silent night, I surrender myself ♫ 

8
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:10,680
 ♫ Tossing and turning, lost in confusion  In the darkness, I lose my way 

9
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,980
 

10
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,379
Yingxian!

11
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:56,360
Do you know that he has been lying to you?

12
00:01:58,419 --> 00:02:02,179
20 years ago, he was the young master of the Gu family.

13
00:02:02,179 --> 00:02:04,480
After the Gu family was wiped out by enemies,

14
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:09,799
the butler, Fu Beihai, adopted him, and changed his name to Fu Cheng.

15
00:02:09,799 --> 00:02:14,600
They have always thought that the Jiang family took all of the Gu family's assets.

16
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,839
So, they approached you to recover the same.

17
00:02:17,839 --> 00:02:20,200
Yingxian, hear me out.

18
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,500
- It's not what you think. 
 - There's no need to explain.

19
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,280
Are you trying to say that you have no ulterior motives by approaching Yingxian?

20
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,600
Or are you trying to say that your name isn't Fu Cheng?

21
00:02:36,859 --> 00:02:39,799
Yingxian, you cannot marry him.

22
00:02:39,799 --> 00:02:44,780
If you marry him, you're letting them get away with their plan.

23
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:54,777
Mr. Shen. I take note of what you just told me.

24
00:02:54,777 --> 00:02:57,560
Thank you for making your way here to inform me.

25
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,080
Yingxian.

26
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,960
You don't believe me.

27
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,620
I believe you.

28
00:03:04,299 --> 00:03:07,519
Everything is clearly written on this document.

29
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,599
I will deal with the rest myself.

30
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:12,799
I don't want to trouble you, Mr. Shen.

31
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,140
Fine.

32
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,920
I'm leaving.

33
00:03:27,576 --> 00:03:29,177
Yingxian.

34
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:34,519
- We... 
 - We're breaking up because it is the best option

35
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:37,680
for both the Jiang and Shen families in the current situation.

36
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,500
It has nothing to do with other people.

37
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,260
 ♫ Promises were made, Moments were missed ♫ 

38
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:18,160
 ♫ Sadness lingers ♫ 

39
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,760
 ♫ Aren't you the one ♫ 

40
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:26,740
 ♫ Who pretends to be a stranger
after falling in love? ♫ 

41
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,860
 ♫ I'm torn, not knowing what to choose ♫ 

42
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:33,840
 ♫ Giving up and then picking it up again ♫ 

43
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,760
 ♫ What more do you want from me? ♫ 

44
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:40,440
 ♫ If it's not enough,
I'll fill it with persistence ♫ 

45
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,560
 ♫ How do I describe your silhouette? ♫ 

46
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,840
 ♫ All you gave me was a love out of sync ♫ 

47
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,640
 ♫ The marks left behind are being pulled ♫ 

48
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,960
 ♫ And finally torn apart ♫ 

49
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,660
 ♫ The fireworks cool the loneliness ♫ 

50
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:03,380
 ♫ Yet you ask me to keep safe ♫ 

51
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:07,759
 ♫ All my memories of you ♫ 

52
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,839
Shen Dongyang wouldn't investigate Fu Cheng for no reason.

53
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:14,859
Go and find out who Shen Dongyang got in touch with recently.

54
00:05:14,859 --> 00:05:17,460
Find out who made him so interested in Fu Cheng.

55
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,639
Boss.

56
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:22,000
Only those in the family know you were going to propose to Fu Cheng.

57
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,020
No one else but his sister knows so much about Fu Cheng's situation.

58
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,999
I knew it was Fu Zhi's doing, but I need more concrete evidence.

59
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,919
In that case, do we need to verify whether the information is true?

60
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:44,580
Judging from his reaction today, it's obvious that it is true.

61
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:51,900
Boss, what will you do?

62
00:05:54,519 --> 00:06:00,720
I think he had an ulterior motive when he first approached me.

63
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,760
Later...

64
00:06:04,336 --> 00:06:08,639
 He probably discovered that we were not related to the Gu family. 

65
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:13,240
 Furthermore, he has fallen in love with me. 

66
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:18,380
 So, he is sincere about being with me right now. 

67
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:22,140
 ♫ All my memories of you ♫

74
00:06:42,719 --> 00:06:44,999
Do you trust him that much, Boss?

75
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,399
Not really.

76
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:53,319
I just want to give him a chance to explain.

77
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:58,759
Forget about Fu Cheng for now, and investigate Shen Dongyang.

78
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:03,079
I'm worried that he might do something else.

79
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:04,909
Don't worry, Boss.

80
00:07:06,163 --> 00:07:10,780
 ♫ But only those who've loved
have the right to remain silent ♫

 ♫ It's not that I talk endlessly
to push away your reluctance ♫ 

82
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,279
Brother.

83
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,819
I should have...

84
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,800
told her sooner.

85
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,440
Brother, don't be like this. She's not worth it.

86
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,959
Don't forget that she is our enemy.

87
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:34,859
She isn't!

88
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,340
She is not related to the annihilation of the Gu family.

89
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:43,719
Even if she didn't do it, she is currently the head of the Jiang family.

90
00:07:43,719 --> 00:07:47,319
She should be responsible for everything the Jiang family did.

91
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:49,359
The Jiang family...

92
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,819
has nothing to do with what happened back then.

93
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,140
It was your father

94
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:05,310
who accidentally leaked information about the Gu family to the enemies

95
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:08,259
which caused the Gu family to be wiped out.

96
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,600
The Jiang family only used the opportunity

97
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,399
to acquire most of the Gu family's assets at a low price.

98
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:24,000
Jiang Zhen took advantage of the situation, but he didn't do anything harmful.

99
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,859
Impossible.

100
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:31,860
My father... My father said it was the Jiang family.

101
00:08:34,439 --> 00:08:37,619
I think Uncle Fu felt very guilty...

102
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,500
and it turned into a grudge.

103
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,080
However, he couldn't abandon both of us.

104
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:56,080
So, he put the blame on the Jiang family, who gained the most out of this.

105
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:58,659
He lied to us...

106
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,060
and lied to himself.

107
00:09:05,539 --> 00:09:07,240
It's all my fault.

108
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,210
If I hadn't exposed his lies,

109
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:14,150
he wouldn't have committed suicide.

110
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:16,460
I've let him down.

111
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,639
Why did this happen?

112
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,399
This shouldn't have happened.

113
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,000
Xiao Zhi.

114
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,679
Return to Jiang Mansion for now.

115
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,639
I'm going to find Yingxian.

116
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,739
I need to make it clear to her.

117
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:42,220
I need to make it clear to her.

118
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,839
Brother.

119
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,039
 Jiang Yingxian. I don't care if there's a grudge between you and the Gu family. 

120
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:58,919
 You caused my father's death, and stole my brother away from me. 

121
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:02,320
 You've been enjoying life for many years as the heiress of a rich family. 

122
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,759
 It's time for you to lose everything. 

123
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,499
Fu Cheng, there's a new mission.

124
00:10:13,499 --> 00:10:16,439
You are required to return to the camp with me. We must depart immediately.

125
00:10:16,439 --> 00:10:20,720
Brother. Since you are busy, you should return to the camp with this officer.

126
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,679
I will explain it to Sister Yingxian for you.

127
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,720
All right.

128
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,759
Xiao Zhi, you must help me clear things up.

129
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,279
Let's go.

130
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:52,279
What? He left without saying a word?

131
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:56,720
The person following Fu Zhi said someone picked up Fu Cheng and left the city.

132
00:10:57,399 --> 00:10:59,039
What is Fu Zhi doing now?

133
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:03,019
Fu Zhi is meeting someone, but I'm not sure who she will be meeting.

134
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:21,320
Hello. This is the Jiang Mansion.

135
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,039
Youngest Young Master?

136
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:25,480
What? You're back?

137
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:30,039
If Second Miss Jiang finds out, she will be angry.

138
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,559
All right.

139
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,759
I'll send it to you right away.

140
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:36,919
However, you must tell Second Miss Jiang.

141
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:40,080
Otherwise, I can't help you.

142
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,580
All right.

143
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:02,320
Hello. Is this the Bureau of Telecommunication?

144
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,080
Can you help me check the phone number that just called here?

145
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,000
Yes. The previous call.

146
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,320
Hello. Is it Young Master Jiang?

147
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,779
It has been so long, Young Master Jiang.

148
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,840
Are you the one who asked me to meet you here?

149
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,000
Do we know each other?

150
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,959
I am Fu Zhi.

151
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,679
Fu Zhi?

152
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:56,040
It sounds familiar.

153
00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:00,159
Were you the one at Haicheng the other day?

154
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:01,820
It's me.

155
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,339
Why are you looking for me?

156
00:13:04,339 --> 00:13:07,159
My second sister should have paid you the compensation that day.

157
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:10,600
What? Are you here to ask for more money today?

158
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,200
You're mistaken, Young Master Jiang.

159
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,519
I came to find you because I want to work with you.

160
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,399
Work with me? Why do you want to work with me?

161
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:23,480
Miss Jiang sent you abroad yet you came back in secret

162
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:28,279
because you wanted to be the head of the Jiang family.

163
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:33,720
Are you trying to tell me that you can help me become the head?

164
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,220
I can help you indeed.

165
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,960
What do you want from me?

166
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:47,559
Are you trying to become my wife?

167
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:49,120
You are overthinking, Young Master Jiang.

168
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,200
I just want Miss Jiang to stop clinging to my brother.

169
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:55,720
Your brother?

170
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,559
- Who is your brother? 
 - Fu Cheng.

171
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,479
Fu Cheng...

172
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,019
My sister's handsome bodyguard?

173
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:09,919
My sister is interested in him?

174
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,240
She must be out of her mind.

175
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:17,980
Anyway, I am the only person who can help you now.

176
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:27,300


177
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:53,900
 ♫ I often think of the last time we met ♫ 

178
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:59,900
 ♫ You stood before me with a real smile ♫ 

179
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:04,600
 ♫ I was a little restless ♫ 

180
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,940
 ♫ But I finally said goodbye ♫ 

181
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:14,580
 ♫ You turned and walked away into the winter ♫ 

182
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:19,380
 ♫ Life is short, and the world is big ♫ 

183
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:23,420
 ♫ We'll say goodbye at any moment ♫ 

184
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,180
 ♫ And the words we didn't finish ♫ 

185
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:30,240
 ♫ Become knots in time ♫ 

186
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,780
 ♫ I asked the wind when you'd be back ♫ 

187
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:37,980
 ♫ The wind was silent ♫ 

188
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:41,920
 ♫ We met but we couldn't stand by each other ♫ 

189
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,820
 ♫ Love is not our destiny ♫ 

190
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:49,320
 ♫ I asked the wind when you'd be back ♫ 

191
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,540
 ♫ You are silent ♫ 

192
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:56,160
 ♫ Even after all these years,
we can't see each other ♫ 

193
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:05,180
 ♫ I can only dazedly see you in the crowd ♫ 

194
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:19,420
 ♫ Life is short, and the world is big ♫ 

195
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:23,420
 ♫ We'll say goodbye at any moment ♫ 

196
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,200
 ♫ And the words we didn't finish ♫ 

197
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:30,240
 ♫ Become knots in time ♫ 

198
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,820
 ♫ I asked the wind when you'd be back ♫ 

199
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:37,940
 ♫ The wind was silent ♫ 

200
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:41,960
 ♫ We met but we couldn't stand by each other ♫ 

201
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,860
 ♫ Love is not our destiny ♫ 

202
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:49,260
 ♫ I asked the wind when you'd be back ♫ 

203
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:52,540
 ♫ You are silent ♫ 

204
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:56,220
 ♫ Even after all these years,
we can't see each other ♫ 

205
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,260
 ♫ I can only dazedly see you in the crowd ♫
