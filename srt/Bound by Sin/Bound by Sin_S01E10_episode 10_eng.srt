00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:15,150


2
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:31,680
♫  Wandering aimlessly with no destination in mind  ♫

3
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:37,240
♫  Tonight's moonlight feels desolate  ♫

4
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,680
♫  Alone, I try to block it out  ♫

5
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,880
♫  But unexpectedly  ♫

6
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:51,880
♫  The longing is unavoidable  ♫

7
00:00:53,100 --> 00:01:00,020
♫  The silent night compels me to surrender  ♫

8
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:11,680
♫  Wandering in the darkness, I lose my way  ♫

9
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:33,150
   

10
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,080
   

11
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,439
Second Sister? You're back!

12
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:52,040
You're still alive?

13
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,460
No way. Impossible!

14
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,699
Eldest Brother, sorry to have disappointed you.

15
00:02:01,639 --> 00:02:05,760
Father, I've brought Yingsi back.

16
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,160
So this is the illegitimate child you've been so obsessed with.

17
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,679
And it's a girl, too.

18
00:02:27,219 --> 00:02:31,979
Haven't you embarrassed yourself enough today?

19
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,610
Hello, I'm Jiang Yingsi.

20
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,820
My mother wanted to get back at you for abandoning her,

21
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,540
so she lied and told you I was a boy.

22
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,239
Sorry for making you waste all these years on false hope.

23
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,980
No wonder I searched for you for years,

24
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:57,100
but found nothing.

25
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:03,420
So, are you two done causing trouble today?

26
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,179
I'm tired.

27
00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:10,500
Yingxian, come with me.

28
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,930
Fu Cheng, come here and kiss me.

29
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,119
Why?

30
00:04:24,679 --> 00:04:26,940
Why did you lie to me?

31
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:31,460
- Do you know how much I... 
 - Let's break up.

32
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,419
We shouldn't see each other again.

33
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,920
Shen Dongyang and I are getting married soon.

34
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,190
 As for your eldest brother, 

35
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:51,920
 I'll send him to the overseas branch. 

36
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:56,419
 You'll take over the business he's been handling. 

37
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,479
 All right. 

38
00:04:59,479 --> 00:05:03,679
 One more thing. You should marry Dongyang as soon as possible. 

39
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:05,530
 Once you're married, 

40
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:10,870
 I'll officially hand over control of the family business to you. 

41
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,799
Fu Cheng.

42
00:05:23,999 --> 00:05:27,180
I'll have Ke Rui give you a sum of money tomorrow

43
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:31,870
as payment for your work as my bodyguard.

44
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,160
Miss Jiang, is this some kind of breakup fee?

45
00:05:43,679 --> 00:05:48,559
Miss Jiang, are you afraid I'll keep clinging to you?

46
00:05:48,559 --> 00:05:50,600
Have you forgotten...

47
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,820
that you have something on me?

48
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:01,480
Or have you always seen me as some kind of...

49
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,019
What?

50
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:07,330
Can't say it,

51
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,110
can you?

52
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:32,600
Words that are too shameful to say aloud...

53
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:40,259
will only sound worse when spoken by someone else.

54
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,080
That's why I had to let you go.

55
00:06:57,799 --> 00:07:01,640
Mr. Jiang, what is this meeting about?

56
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:05,780
I just want to meet the person my sister cares about most before I leave,

57
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,400
and have a chat.

58
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,139
Then I'm afraid I'll disappoint you.

59
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:16,020
I'm not the person Second Miss Jiang cares most about.

60
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:21,439
It doesn't matter. As long as I can make her uncomfortable.

61
00:07:23,139 --> 00:07:25,290
My father doesn't like my wife,

62
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:30,060
so I simply don't bring her back for him to see.

63
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,759
It's a lie to say I don't regret it.

64
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:39,119
Sacrificing my career for a woman was a bad deal.

65
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,400
I've never really loved my wife.

66
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:47,480
The drama back then was born from rebellion.

67
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:52,559
I'm the eldest son, and I've been pretty outstanding.

68
00:07:52,559 --> 00:07:57,559
Everyone around me thought I'd be the heir to the Jiang family.

69
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,379
I was used to things going my way,

70
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:03,540
so I got arrogant,

71
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:07,199
and forgot that my father doesn't have only one son,

72
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,960
and that I'm not irreplaceable.

73
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:19,079
I just never imagined the one who'd eventually take over would be Jiang Yingxian,

74
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:24,560
the obedient sister who loved playing with dolls and acting cute.

75
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,400
It sounds like you don't really know your sister at all.

76
00:08:29,219 --> 00:08:34,020
Telling me all this won't bother her in the least.

77
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,439
Having learned from my mistakes, what do you think Jiang Yingxian will choose?

78
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,120
 She never really thought about choosing. 

79
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:55,199
 What she's always wanted is to be the head of the Jiang family. 

80
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,240
   

81
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,439
Boss.

82
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:13,360
This was delivered by Fu Cheng this morning.

83
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,380
Fu Cheng?

84
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:18,819
He insisted I give it to you. Then he left.

85
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,320
   

86
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,530
 "Worse still, 

87
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:30,780
 Shen Dongyang is suspected of smuggling contraband for foreign forces, 

88
00:09:30,789 --> 00:09:34,460
 which poses a serious threat to national security and stability." 

89
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:42,120
 The Nan Army and the Revolutionary Army clashed outside Haicheng. 

90
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,920
 The Nan Army was defeated and has retreated to Haicheng. 

91
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,960
   

92
00:10:25,719 --> 00:10:28,060
Why did you choose a black wedding dress?

93
00:10:37,319 --> 00:10:41,739
May I have a dance with you, beautiful bride?

94
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:59,100
Yingxian, how I wish we could get married right now.

95
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,000
The dress fits perfectly. There's no need for adjustments.

96
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,520
Understood.

97
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:24,240
Yingxian, I have a business trip on the 9th.

98
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,920
I need you to go to Haicheng and pick up some goods for me.

99
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,839
What kind of goods?

100
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,799
Haicheng's been in chaos lately.

101
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:38,400
I'm not sure if I can get the goods safely.

102
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,920
This batch is very important.

103
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,079
Can you go and personally retrieve it?

104
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:49,319
I don't trust anyone else.

105
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:52,120
All right.

106
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,079
Boss, if the information Fu Cheng gave us is true,

107
00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:06,870
the goods Mr. Shen asked us to help pick up

108
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:09,760
probably aren't coming from legitimate sources.

109
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,000
Business is tough these days.

110
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
He's probably just smuggling some cigarettes or liquor.

111
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,420
As long as it's not too outrageous, we'll turn a blind eye.

112
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:27,479
But in his previous shipments, there was opium.

113
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,040
And considering the timing...

114
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,120
Are you here for the goods?

115
00:13:12,719 --> 00:13:13,959
Here's the bill of lading.

116
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,899
You can check it. 
    

117
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,640
What is it? Is there something wrong with the bill?

118
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,270
It looks fine,

119
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:35,079
but as I recall, the order was placed by a man.

120
00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:39,100
He didn't mention that two gorgeous ladies would be picking up the goods.

121
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,640
Since the bill is fine, please hand over the goods now.

122
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,479
What's the rush, ladies?

123
00:13:46,479 --> 00:13:51,699
How about you tell me what's in these goods first?

124
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:57,439
Since you're suspicious of our identities,

125
00:13:57,439 --> 00:14:01,819
why don't we reschedule and have the boss come himself to pick up the goods next time?

126
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:08,340
Boss, I checked. There's no ambush around.

127
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,400
Stop right there.

128
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,959
Ladies, have some patience.

129
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,020
These goods are from the US.

130
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:25,140
You can't blame me for being cautious.

131
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:28,040
Head back with me first.

132
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,920
Tell your boss to have 20 gold bars ready.

133
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,240
Then we'll hand over the goods together.

134
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,079
What do you say?

135
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,959
Find a chance to run.

136
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:43,559
No need.

137
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:46,980
We didn't close the deal this time, but we can try again next time.

138
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,419
Do you think you can just leave?

139
00:14:52,779 --> 00:14:54,299
Let's go.

140
00:14:55,719 --> 00:14:57,140
- Ke Rui! 
 - Don't let them get away!

141
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,839
- Get up! 
 - Go after them!

142
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:00,383
Hurry!

143
00:15:00,383 --> 00:15:01,520
You go first!

144
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,920
Their people are everywhere.

145
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:05,179
Even if I leave first, where can I escape to?

146
00:15:05,179 --> 00:15:06,599
Come on.

147
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,000
It's the military! Retreat!

148
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,319
- Stop! 
 - Freeze!

149
00:16:19,319 --> 00:16:21,539
- Get down! 
 - Don't move!

150
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,400
Major, there are two ladies here.

151
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,179
One of them has a leg injury and needs a stretcher.

152
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,140
Is it serious?

153
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,739
I'm not injured. Ke Rui is.

154
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,980
Take them back to the camp.

155
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:12,030


156
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:28,020
♫  You set off for another, warmer world  ♫

157
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:33,040
♫  I stop, yet I've never said goodbye to the past  ♫

158
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,480
♫  Mourning as I watch you leave, the sadness never ceases  ♫

159
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,160
♫  Tears of regret, pain running deep  ♫

160
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,050
♫  You've gone to a world that isn't yours   ♫

161
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:47,180
♫  Here's a song for the passersby of life  ♫

162
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:52,200
♫  As you listen, will you shed tears?  ♫

163
00:17:52,200 --> 00:18:01,610
♫  The past has been cremated and placed in a box in my heart  ♫

164
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:08,020
♫  Crying as I say, "I'm not afraid, I've forgotten the sadness"  ♫

165
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:13,060
♫  You sing while standing in the river of life  ♫

166
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:21,620
♫  The past has been cremated, there's no need to rely on anyone to live  ♫

167
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:48,760
♫  You understand, right? I think you understand now  ♫

168
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:53,860
♫  Novelty only becomes scary once it's past  ♫

169
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:56,380
♫  Even deities cry  ♫

170
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,940
♫  They pity us as we live foolishly  ♫

171
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:02,940
♫  I respect your final decision  ♫

172
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:08,080
♫  Here's a song for the passersby of life  ♫

173
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:13,060
♫  As you listen, will you shed tears?  ♫

174
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:22,530
♫  The past has been cremated and placed in a box in my heart  ♫

175
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:28,900
♫  Crying as I say, "I'm not afraid, I've forgotten the pain"  ♫

176
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:34,120
♫  You sing while standing barefoot in the river of life  ♫
