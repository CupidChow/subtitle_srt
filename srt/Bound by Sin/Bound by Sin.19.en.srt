00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,360
what are you doing here?

121
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,190
I got injured a few days ago.

122
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,870
Luckily, Major Fu rescued me,

123
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,360
and I followed him back to the camp.

124
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,750
I'll be returning to Gangcheng tomorrow.

125
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,560
What about you?

126
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,750
Weren't you supposed to be in school?

127
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,680
Why did you join the military?

128
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,950
After I got back to Pingcheng,

129
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,510
I joined the Pingcheng Red Cross.

130
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:25,510
I've learned a lot about medicine there.

131
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,360
Now, we're here

132
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,480
to offer assistance.

133
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,360
It's too dangerous to join the military now.

134
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,360
Why don't you head to Gangcheng with me tomorrow?

135
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,240
I'll send you abroad to study with Yingqi.

136
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:37,430
Yingxian,

137
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:40,000
I know staying here is dangerous,

138
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,430
but the army needs us,

139
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,190
and the people of Haicheng need us too.

140
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,270
Let the soldiers fight the war.

141
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,360
You're still young.

142
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,310
You should go somewhere safe and focus on your studies.

143
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,680
Yingxian,

144
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,120
why didn't you go abroad with Yingqi?

145
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,560
Why are you staying in Gangcheng?

146
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:56,800
I...

147
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:58,830
I know

148
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,720
your goal has always been

149
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,510
to become the head of the Jiang family.

150
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,560
So, as the family head,

151
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,830
naturally, you need to be

152
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,360
with the Jiang family in times of crisis.

153
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,750
Am I right, Yingxian?

154
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,240
Though staying in Gangcheng

155
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,870
isn't as safe as going abroad,

156
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:14,830
it's still safer than being on the battlefield.

157
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,720
Yingxian,

158
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,750
I know you're worried about me,

159
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,750
but this is what I want to do.

160
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,750
I've worked hard

161
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,160
to join the Red Cross.

162
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,510
I want to contribute

163
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,830
to my country.

164
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,950
Even if I end up sacrificing my life,

165
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,440
it would be an honor.

166
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,320
You think it's an honor

167
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:36,870
to sacrifice yourself?

168
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:53,910
Why are you still up?

169
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,600
We've got a long journey ahead tomorrow.

170
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,670
Get some rest.

171
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,320
How about we stay up together tonight?

172
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:03,870
Alright.

173
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,440
Let's wish for safety,

174
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,960
health,

175
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:09,360
and good fortune

176
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,150
in the new year.

177
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,440
Yingsi told me earlier

178
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,120
that she'd be willing

179
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:24,120
to give her life for her country if it came to that.

180
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:26,910
It made me wonder,

181
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,550
do you feel the same way?

182
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:30,870
Not a day goes by

183
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,440
that I don't wish for the war to end soon

184
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,790
so I can make it to the day

185
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,840
when a new world and new life arrive.

186
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,670
It will happen.

187
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,240
It definitely will.

188
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:00,670
Don't worry about me, Yingxian.

189
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,360
Just go.

190
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,080
If you run into trouble, come find me in Gangcheng.

191
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,390
Our door will always be open to you.

192
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,200
Something seems off up ahead.

193
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,000
Go and see what's going on.

194
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:52,630
Got it.

195
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,360
Buddy, stop the truck.

196
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,630
Excuse me.

197
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,030
What's going on up ahead?

198
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:05,750
Sir,

199
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:06,910
I haven't done anything wrong!

200
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,320
I don't have any money, either!

201
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,120
Don't be afraid, sir.

202
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,840
Are you from Gangcheng?

203
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,320
These people

204
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,960
all fled from Gangcheng.

205
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,910
What happened in Gangcheng?

206
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,550
Last night,

207
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:26,320
Governor Jin and Commander Chen got into a fight.

208
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,840
It's said that Commander Chen got killed.

209
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,150
The city's in chaos,

210
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,030
and a lot of people have died.

211
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:32,720
Sir,

212
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:34,870
do you know if the Jiang family is okay?

213
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,440
How would we common folk

214
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,390
know what's going on with those rich families?

215
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,630
But I've heard

216
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:40,840
that several mansions

217
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,240
have been surrounded by soldiers sent by Governor Jin.

218
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,390
Yingxian,

219
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,120
maybe you should come back to the camp with us.

220
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:53,870
We don't know what's going on

221
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:54,630
in Gangcheng right now.

222
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:56,240
No,

223
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,670
I need to get into the city.

224
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,720
At a time like this,

225
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,120
if I, the head of the family, am not there with my family,

226
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:05,000
I'm not sure if they can survive.

227
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,510
I'll go with you.

228
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:11,120
You head back

229
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,320
and report the situation in Gangcheng to the higher-ups.

230
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:15,480
Major,

231
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,360
it's too dangerous to go into the city now.

232
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,840
Don't worry.

233
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,630
We're just merchants.

234
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,030
I'm sure if we offer enough money,

235
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,030
whether it's Governor Jin or anyone else,

236
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,550
they won't give us too much trouble.

237
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:28,910
Alright.

238
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,840
I'll report back as soon as possible.

239
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:31,840
Go ahead.
