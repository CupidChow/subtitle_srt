1
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:29,173
 ♫ Drifting aimlessly ♫ 

2
00:00:29,173 --> 00:00:31,756
 ♫ Not knowing where to go ♫ 

3
00:00:31,756 --> 00:00:37,369
 ♫ The moonlight tonight feels sorrowful ♫ 

4
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,815
 ♫ I stand alone against it ♫ 

5
00:00:42,815 --> 00:00:45,012
 ♫ But I don't want to ♫ 

6
00:00:45,012 --> 00:00:51,585
 ♫ The longing catches me off guard ♫ 

7
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:59,019
 ♫ To the silent night, I surrender myself ♫ 

8
00:01:00,099 --> 00:01:01,596
 ♫ Tossing and turning, lost in confusion ♫ 

9
00:01:01,596 --> 00:01:10,587
 ♫ In the darkness, I lose my way ♫ 

10
00:01:33,786 --> 00:01:36,692
 

11
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:56,440
Get out.

12
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,240
Miss Jiang.

13
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,680
Why are you here?

14
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,280
Get lost.

15
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,000
- Miss Jiang, let me wait on you.
- Get out!

16
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,200
 People all say women
are money-orientated and vain. 

17
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,839
 I think that works for men, too, 

18
00:02:53,839 --> 00:02:57,280
 but there are too few women for them to climb
the social ladder. 

19
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,240
Since it's harmless, why bother to change it?

20
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,280
Your new plaything?

21
00:03:10,119 --> 00:03:12,216
You're particularly generous this time?

22
00:03:12,216 --> 00:03:14,280
 

23
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,359
 Is everyone the plaything of this couple? 

24
00:03:17,359 --> 00:03:20,115
 There is moral decay in society. 

25
00:03:20,115 --> 00:03:22,280
I was filmed again.

26
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,840
Seems like journalism also needs to be rectified.

27
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,919
Are you upset?

28
00:03:38,545 --> 00:03:44,759
If you don't want to see her,
I can make her disappear forever.

29
00:03:48,679 --> 00:03:49,959
No need.

30
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:54,000
If you escalate it, people will really
think there's something going on.

31
00:03:54,839 --> 00:03:56,679
That's right.

32
00:03:56,679 --> 00:03:58,920
We can't always hide the truth
as it's likely to give ourselves away,

33
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,600
especially when we're in the same boat.

34
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:06,639
So we can't hide secrets in the office.

35
00:04:14,359 --> 00:04:16,199
Hello, Mr. Shen.

36
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:22,440
Boss. I got an invitation to
tonight's charity auction dinner.

37
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,559
Are you up for it?

38
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,840
I'm not available today.

39
00:04:37,999 --> 00:04:40,039
I'll be with you another day.

40
00:04:41,679 --> 00:04:43,280
Walk Mr. Shen out.

41
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,919
Mr. Shen, after you.

42
00:05:25,609 --> 00:05:29,439
 

43
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:31,799
Don't burn my home.

44
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:33,480
Mr. Cheng, let's go.

45
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,720
- Go!
- No!

46
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,280
- Go!
- No!

47
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,440
Cheng.

48
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:49,080
This is our only chance.

49
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,119
The Jiangs are famous for their cunningness.

50
00:05:52,119 --> 00:05:54,400
Be wary of them.

51
00:06:23,119 --> 00:06:28,520
 Guess which of us is the game
and which is the hunter. 

52
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,994
 

53
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:47,480
We've finally solved what happened in
Jiangbei Village, but Mr. Ying Jian must be angry.

54
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,720
I didn't want to take over that mess,

55
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,133
but my father asked me to do it,
and I have to do my best.

56
00:06:54,133 --> 00:06:58,093
I'm afraid Mr. Ying Jian
can't cool down this time.

57
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,720
Let's get down to business.

58
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,960
How's the investigation into that love child?

59
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:12,119
Miss Jiang, may I have the honor?

60
00:07:13,559 --> 00:07:15,239
It's my pleasure.

61
00:07:19,559 --> 00:07:22,479
- Miss Xu is beautiful as always.
- Of course.

62
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:28,559
Director Yu, I'm much obliged to you
for what you did for Jiangbei Village.

63
00:07:29,595 --> 00:07:30,946
Director Shen asked me
 

64
00:07:30,946 --> 00:07:32,040
to help you.
 

65
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,679
I must take it seriously.

66
00:07:34,679 --> 00:07:38,111
Miss Jiang, you're not only stunning,
but also well-connected.

67
00:07:38,111 --> 00:07:41,310
I can't believe you know Director Shen.

68
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,200
Director Yu, thanks for training me.

69
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,239
Miss Jiang, you have a way with words.

70
00:07:49,239 --> 00:07:53,200
I'll support you as much as I can.

71
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,679
Sorry to bother you.

72
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:02,880
Miss Jiang, the Trading Company
needs you to deal with an emergency.

73
00:08:08,799 --> 00:08:10,840
It seems it's really urgent.

74
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,119
I've never seen my bodyguard with a poker face
be so rude.

75
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:16,720
Director Yu, excuse me.

76
00:08:49,719 --> 00:08:51,479
That's how you protected your boss, right?

77
00:08:51,479 --> 00:08:54,519
You stood by and let her
be bullied by that deputy director general.

78
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:02,120
Was he insane?
How dare a deputy director general feel up Boss!

79
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,160
So can a director general do that kind of thing?

80
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,481
Even a deputy director general has a way
to make us uncomfortable.

81
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:15,999
Mr. Fu, good night.

82
00:09:17,353 --> 00:09:19,439
I have something to deal with.

83
00:09:19,439 --> 00:09:20,840
Bye.

84
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:28,679
Do you have any clues?

85
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:30,760
It's been ages.

86
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:35,479
I can only find out that woman
went to the north after she left Jiang's Mansion.

87
00:09:35,479 --> 00:09:36,960
North?

88
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,279
I forgot. That man brought it to you
in the morning.

89
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,840
Fu Cheng?

90
00:09:54,937 --> 00:09:59,032
It seems that he earns a lot as a bodyguard.

91
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:02,519
Since he can come up with
so much money within two months,

92
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,639
he must have brought all his earnings here.

93
00:10:07,719 --> 00:10:14,599
 If it's Fu Cheng, will he touch women's thighs
like those men after getting drunk? 

94
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,519
These days, this is the first time
I've seen someone rush to pay back the money.

95
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:29,867
Oh right. Boss, you and Fu Cheng...

96
00:10:29,867 --> 00:10:31,440
North.

97
00:10:32,199 --> 00:10:33,879
Fu Cheng.

98
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,879
A coincidence or a trap?

99
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:58,719
 Why did I help her on impulse today? 

100
00:10:58,719 --> 00:11:00,920
 Isn't she my enemy? 

101
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:06,040
 Why am I becoming less like myself? 

102
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,040
Mr. Fu.

103
00:11:21,439 --> 00:11:24,879
I didn't expect to see you again so soon.

104
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,079
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

105
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,440
Looks like Miss Xu hung out
till very late tonight.

106
00:11:32,599 --> 00:11:36,519
Miss Jiang, what do you want?

107
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:39,960
I've come up with the terms.

108
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,559
What terms?

109
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:45,119
Come.

110
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:07,359
I want you.

111
00:12:20,792 --> 00:12:22,858
 

112
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,639
Boss, do you really fall for that fool?

113
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,959
My dad started looking for the love child.

114
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:45,920
Fu Cheng coming from the north happened
to show up, and he caught my interest.

115
00:12:47,599 --> 00:12:50,879
What a coincidence.

116
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:36,120
 It's said that power is the best aphrodisiac. 

117
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:42,239
 It's true for both men, and women. 

118
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:18,620
 Fu Cheng can't possibly imagine
his extreme forbearance and restraint 

119
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:22,560
 will so easily arouse my desire to control him. 

120
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:33,200
 I've never met a pure person like him in my life. 

121
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:09,360
Jiang Ying Xian, what kind of woman are you?

122
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,160
How could you...

123
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,280
I saw it last time.

124
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,520
I thought it suited you well.

125
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:19,640
Boss, you may have to stop testing people.

126
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:23,679
Shen Dong Yang can have several mistresses.
It doesn't mean you can follow suit.

127
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:26,520
You should keep a distance from Fu Cheng.

128
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,520
You're a little too interested in him.

129
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,840
Ke Rui.

130
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,120
Don't cross the line.

131
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,680
Sorry.

132
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:39,959
Boss. Don't be blindly optimistic
about men's personality.

133
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:43,799
Shen Dong Yang's desire to control you
is getting more and more...

134
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:45,200
I know.

135
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:50,160
Recently, Jiang Zhen has increasingly valued me.

136
00:15:51,439 --> 00:15:52,839
Tell me.

137
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:58,960
Does he value my ability, or is it just because
of my relationship with Shen Dong Yang?

138
00:16:01,368 --> 00:16:05,727
I think lands suit me more than jewelry.

139
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:15,119
Why my fiancée is always such a disappointment?

140
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:21,120
I don't think it's time for us to be so close.

141
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,040
What? Stop pretending to be pure.

142
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:31,319
The whole Gangcheng knows
our Miss Jiang is a womanizer.

143
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:35,800
When I had affairs with others,
I spent money on them.

144
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:43,359
But I've made large sums of money for you.

145
00:17:11,499 --> 00:17:14,379
 ♫ When can I ♫ 

146
00:17:14,379 --> 00:17:18,038
 ♫ stop panicking? ♫ 

147
00:17:19,358 --> 00:17:25,328
 ♫ I seem to accept the hard living calmly ♫ 

148
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,116

152
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:49,022
 ♫ But my eyes still look dull ♫ 

153

 ♫ The air is filled with

00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:43,193
 ♫ When I take off the evening dress naked ♫ 

164
00:18:43,193 --> 00:18:47,117
 ♫ But my eyes still look dull ♫ 

165
00:18:47,117 --> 00:18:51,440
 ♫ The air is filled with
helplessness and despair ♫ 

166
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,303
 ♫ Sadness has nowhere to hide ♫ 

167
00:18:54,303 --> 00:18:58,859
 ♫ I might as well cry and let go of the past ♫ 

168
00:18:58,859 --> 00:19:02,849
 ♫ I might as well make a scene and fly freely ♫ 

169
00:19:02,849 --> 00:19:04,891
 ♫ I might as well go traveling ♫ 

170
00:19:04,891 --> 00:19:09,863
 ♫ I might as well forget my wandering days ♫ 

171
00:19:09,863 --> 00:19:14,239
 ♫ No need to pretend,
I was quite strong all those days ♫ 

172
00:19:14,239 --> 00:19:17,614
 ♫ No need to force myself to lie again ♫ 

173
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:19,858
 ♫ I might as well be frank ♫ 

174
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:24,759
 ♫ On a peaceful evening ♫
