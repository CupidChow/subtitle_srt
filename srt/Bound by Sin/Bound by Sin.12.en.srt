Is she fine?

131
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,240
She got shot in her calf

132
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,910
but she was treated properly.

133
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,390
I was worried that her wound would re-open after the journey

134
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,790
so I sent her to the hospital first.

135

Yingxian,

169
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:26,200
I didn't do it.

170
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:27,750
Father wanted to beat me.

172
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:29,510
I dodged to the side

173
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:30,440
and he fell.

174
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:31,750
I swear.

175
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:32,910
I didn't do it.

176
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,270
I didn't even touch his clothes.

177
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,080
Master Jiang,

178
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:38,670

179

that Yingxian would be in danger.

180
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:41,960
However, since it has come to this,

181
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,910
I hope it doesn't affect the partnership

182
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:47,080
between the Jiang family and the Shen family.

183
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,960
Yingxian's whereabouts are unknown.

184
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:54,600
Not only does the Shen family not show any remorse

185
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,790
but you even want the Jiang family to take the blame.

186
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,720
Is this the sincerity you show in our partnership?

187
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,200
Master Jiang,

188
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,270
it's exactly because Yingxian is missing

189
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:09,480
that this matter can be forgotten

190
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,630
if the Jiang family is willing to admit ownership of these goods

191
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:15,750
and pin the blame on Yingxian.

192
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,480
The loss is reduced to the minimum

193
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,440
for both the Jiang family and the Shen family.

194
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,510
Oh.

195
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:35,600
I heard Yingqi and Deputy Commander Lu's son

196
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,790
were close.

197
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,840
Governor Jin

198
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,030
is investigating

199
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:43,080
Deputy Commander Lu's bribery case.

200
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:48,480
I only hope Yingqi won't be implicated.

201
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,000
Jiang Yingqi!

202
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:18,510
Master Jiang, I hope you consider it

203
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,270
and make a decision soon.

204
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,270
Dad.

205
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:41,790
Dad.

206
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:42,790
Dad!

207
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:43,960
You animal!

208
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:52,960
Yingqi,

209
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:54,440
tell me honestly.

210
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,720
After Dad fell,

211
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,630
did you go and call for help immediately?

212
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:58,790
I...

213
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,030
I was stunned

214
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,870
and waited for a few minutes.

215
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,600
Was Dad still awake at that time?

216
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,510
Did he know if you called for help immediately or not?

217
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:10,480
I think he doesn't know.

218
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,750
He fell and twitched a few times.

219
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,870
I called him but he didn't react.

220
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:19,360
It seems like Governor Jin

221
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,720
is going to turn the Nanli District upside down.

222
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:24,910
I wonder if the Jiang family can overcome this.

223
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,870
Internal conflicts must be dealt with before resolving external conflicts.

224
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:50,860
[Jiang Family Elder, Third Eldest Granduncle]

225
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,700
[Jiang Family Elder, Third Uncle]

226
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,700
[Jiang Family Elder, Fourth Uncle]

227
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:58,790
Yingxian

228
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,200
gathered all of us here.

229
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,120
What is she trying to do?

230
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,270
What is she trying to do?

231
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,630
Her father was admitted to the hospital recently.

232
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,750
I'm sure she's trying to usurp the power.

233
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:13,670
In my opinion,

234
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,840
Yingxian has been doing well

235
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,480
in recent years.

236
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,910
I agree to let her

237
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,240
be the head of the Jiang family.

238
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:21,790
Did Yingxian

239
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,960
give you any benefit?

240
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,960
Jiang Zhen has a son.

241
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,360
Even if he doesn't,

242
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,720
he should also adopt one from other families of the clan.

243
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,390
A girl like her

244
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,790
cannot be the head.

245
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,910
Third Brother.

246
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,390
The Qing Dynasty has fallen.

247
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,080
People are talking about the new mindset nowadays.

248
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,080
My daughter

249
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,480
has been telling me

250
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,120
about gender equality every day.

251
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,200
Ridiculous!

252
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,030
Indeed.

253
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:50,030
We've tolerated

254
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,910
her running the business outside.

255
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:54,630
How can we leave the whole Jiang family's business

256
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,440
to a girl like her?

257
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,870
Uncles.

258
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,600
I'm sorry

259
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,030
for making all of you come here

260
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:05,070
so late at night.

261
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:06,680
However, this is urgent

262
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,590
so I have no choice.

263
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,000
Yingxian,

264
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,110
what is the urgent matter

265
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:13,240
that requires you to gather all of us here?

266
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:14,310
Hold on.

267
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,750
In what capacity are you having

268
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,000
this meeting with us today?

269
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,720
In the capacity of the head of the Jiang family, of course.
