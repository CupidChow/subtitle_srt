Are you trying to get yourself killed?

I only figured it out after I got here.

There are supply trucks leaving tomorrow

staying in the camp

What I meant is

56
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,830
that I have full confidence in your ability

Mr. Shen,

61
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:57,000
Miss Jiang didn't manage to pick up the goods.

62
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,190
The Green Axe Gang really can't be trusted.

63
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,040
So did they hold them hostage

64
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,270
and make the Jiang family pay a ransom?

65
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:10,750
The goods were seized by the Revolutionary Army.

66
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,270
What?

67
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,720
How did that happen?

68
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,750
When the gang and Miss Jiang clashed,

69
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,560
a Revolutionary Army patrol happened to be nearby.

70
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,270
Ever since they sent Jin here,

71
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,310
things have been getting tougher.

72
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,720
I was hoping to use

73
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,560
the Jiang family to wrap up this last deal,

74
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:38,160
but still, things went wrong.

75
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:39,360
Mr. Shen,

76
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:43,720
it's possible that Governor Jin knows about this batch of goods now.

77
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:46,480
They're investigating.

78
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,630
If we can't explain ourselves,

79
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:54,830
we might get accused of colluding with the enemy.

80
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,870
Well, it's up to the Jiang family

81
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,750
to help us stay out of this mess.

82
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,500

83
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:14,260

84
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,220
Why do I keep losing?

85
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,190

86
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,630

take it to the higher-ups.

99
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,040
It's not very manly.

100

who those people outside are?

105
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,950

106
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,160

107

Each one of those men

108
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,560
has blood on their hands!

109
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:45,870
And only they know

110
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,160
whether it's enemy's blood

111
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,800
or someone else's.

112
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:53,040

113
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,360
Do you realize

114
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,630
they could've shot you by instinct

115
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,830
even if they didn't plan to kill you?

116
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,680
At that distance,

117
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,120
every single one of them

118
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,430
could've easily shot through your heart!

119
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,430
Answer me.

120
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,680

121
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:18,630

Yes, sir.

188
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,120
Prepare to march.

189
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:22,910
Follow me!

190
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,720
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

191
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,630
The explosion we heard

192
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,080
likely means our camp has been attacked

193
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,000
by the Nan Army.

194
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:42,550
And now,

195
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,150
we've spotted their forces up ahead as well.

196
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,080
It's extremely dangerous to keep heading

197
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:51,600
to Gangcheng now.

198
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,550
I'm going back with you.

199
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,630
But if you go back to the camp with us now,

200
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,150
I can't guarantee your safety.

201
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,910
I'm really sorry.

202
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,790
I didn't expect

203
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,390
to put you in such a difficult position.

204
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,320
I trust you.

205
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,870
I believe you'll keep me safe.

206
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:19,720
Alright.

207
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:44,320
Major Cheng,

208
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,630
the northern part of the city has almost entirely fallen to the Nan Army.

209
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,120
Luckily, our camp didn't suffer too much damage.

210
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:49,720
Good.

211
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:51,150
Reinforcements will be here soon.

212
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:51,750
Good.

213
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,510
Now, as long as we maintain control of the south

214
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,270
and keep the enemy from advancing,

215
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,440
we can take back the north.

216
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:58,270
Arrange for everyone to take a short break.

217
00:14:58,630 --> 00:14:59,390
Once the reinforcements arrive,

218
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,550
we'll launch a counterattack.

219
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:01,360
Understood.

220
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:02,550
Everyone,

221
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:03,150

222
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:16,670
