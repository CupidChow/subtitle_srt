1
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:15,050


2
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:31,680
 ♫ Drifting aimlessly Not knowing where to go ♫ 

3
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:37,240
 ♫ The moonlight tonight feels sorrowful ♫ 

4
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:42,680
 ♫ I stand alone against it ♫ 

5
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,880
 ♫ But I don't want to ♫ 

6
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:51,880
 ♫ The longing catches me off guard ♫ 

7
00:00:53,100 --> 00:01:00,020
 ♫ To the silent night, I surrender myself ♫ 

8
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:11,780
 ♫ Tossing and turning, lost in confusion In the darkness, I lose my way ♫ 

9
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:33,180
   

10
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,980
 

11
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,719
Second Sister, you made a good move.

12
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:53,519
You knew I had returned, but you still let me embarrass myself in front of our uncles.

13
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:56,440
I hope you enjoyed the show.

14
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:00,920
If I didn't let you suffer, would you know what you're made of?

15
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,120
Wait. I don't get it.

16
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,920
You are the head of the Jiang family now.

17
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,000
Shouldn't we work together to retrieve their businesses?

18
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,610
Right now, you are letting them continue their businesses

19
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,119
while sending your brother abroad.

20
00:02:13,119 --> 00:02:16,920
If I hadn't done that, you would've taken so much of our family assets.

21
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:23,239
How did you end up working with Fu Zhi?

22
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,837
S-She came to me first.

23
00:02:28,837 --> 00:02:32,162
Sister, I saw you leaving the city that day.

24
00:02:32,162 --> 00:02:34,399
Why did you come back?

25
00:02:34,399 --> 00:02:38,420
Her tricks could only fool you.

26
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,440
I received a telegram about Fu Cheng being badly ill.

27
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,059
I thought it was too much of a coincidence, so I investigated it

28
00:02:43,059 --> 00:02:45,119
and found out the information was false.

29
00:02:45,119 --> 00:02:47,600
Moreover, both of you have been acting weirdly,

30
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,899
so I took advantage of the plan, and let her see me leave the city.

31
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:55,380
That's... Fu Zhi is not that impressive.

32
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,480
Why did Fu Zhi agree to help you?

33
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,099
What conditions did you agree to?

34
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:03,720
Nothing.

35
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,754
Jiang Yingqi, have you forgotten the feeling of having a gun pointed at your head?

36
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:09,440
Stop it.

37
00:03:10,225 --> 00:03:13,400
She doesn't want you to be with Fu Cheng.

38
00:03:14,065 --> 00:03:15,840
Sister, tell me honestly.

39
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,539
When you received the telegram, you didn't believe it easily.

40
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:21,200
Do you not like Fu Cheng as much as you think?

41
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,379
Without Fu Zhi's intervention, Fu Cheng would already be your brother-in-law.

42
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:33,372
Boss, the person tailing Fu Zhi told me Fu Zhi left the city alone.

43
00:03:33,372 --> 00:03:36,099
She was heading towards Haicheng.

44
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:38,259
It's chaotic nowadays.

45
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:40,419
She is really brave for a young girl.

46
00:03:40,419 --> 00:03:44,180
If something happens to her...

47
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:50,180
Send a telegram to Fu Cheng and ask him to aid her.

48
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,279
Stay here and take care of the Jiang family.

49
00:03:52,279 --> 00:03:55,099
I'll leave the city and try to catch up to her.

50
00:03:55,099 --> 00:03:56,620
Yes.

51
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,879
Major, there's a telegram for you.

52
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,740
It's from Gangcheng.

53
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:11,000
 

54
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:35,689
- Is it her?
- Yes. That's her.

55
00:04:35,689 --> 00:04:37,660
She is the head of the Jiang family.

56
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,350
If you kidnap her,

57
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:42,370
the Jiang family is willing to pay a lot of money for her release.

58
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,879
Girl, what's the rush?

59
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:54,580
What are you doing?

60
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:57,419
Girl, there are so many of us.

61
00:04:57,419 --> 00:05:00,010
We had to suffer so much because of what you told us.

62
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:01,715
What if we were fooled?

63
00:05:01,715 --> 00:05:04,700
Wouldn't we do all this for nothing if we don't get paid?

64
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,119
We can only release you after getting the money.

65
00:05:07,119 --> 00:05:09,480
Getting the money is your problem. It's none of my business.

66
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,350
Let me go!

67
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,559
Don't force us to do this the hard way.

68
00:05:13,559 --> 00:05:15,400
Take her with us.

69
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,740
- Let go! 
 - Move!

70
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,439
Let go!

71
00:05:42,297 --> 00:05:43,897
Fu Zhi.

72
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,759
- Where is this? 
 - Sister Yingxian.

73
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:51,160
This is a bandits' stronghold.

74
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,430
It was all my fault for leaving the city alone,

75
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:56,430
so I ended up getting kidnapped.

76
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,820
Stop crying.

77
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,319
Before I left the city, I sent a telegram to your brother.

78
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,040
He will surely come and find us if he doesn't see us anywhere.

79
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,280
Will my brother come here?

80
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,400
I'm so scared.

81
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,879
Are you the second daughter of Gangcheng's Jiang family, Jiang Yingxian?

82
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:25,119
You investigated my identity?

83
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,520
We kidnapped you because we know who you are.

84
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,720
We have contacted the Jiang family.

85
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:37,119
If the Jiang family is willing to pay us, we won't cause you any trouble.

86
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,600
Wait.

87
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,400
How can I eat with my hands tied?

88
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,520
If I starve to death, do you think you can get a single cent?

89
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,920
What? Do you think I can beat you in a fight?

90
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,119
I'm sure you can't escape.

91
00:07:14,119 --> 00:07:16,480
Don't try anything funny.

92
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:23,879
They clearly know who I am.

93
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,960
Yes.

94
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:36,430
I got them to kidnap you because you caused my father's death,

95
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:38,930
and took my brother away.

96
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:45,239
I thought you revealed my identity because they threatened you.

97
00:07:45,239 --> 00:07:47,468
I didn't expect them to be the ones you hired.

98
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:49,920
You have acquired so much.

99
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,879
Why do you still take things away from me?

100
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:54,120
Why?

101
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,239
Are you crazy, Jiang Yingxian?

102
00:08:02,239 --> 00:08:04,999
Help! She's trying to kill me.

103
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,760
Help me. She tried to kill me.

104
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,679
If I die, all of you will never get paid.

105
00:08:11,679 --> 00:08:12,999
I didn't.

106
00:08:12,999 --> 00:08:14,480
Don't cause any trouble.

107
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,199
We won't forgive you if we don't get paid.

108
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,799
I... I didn't do anything.

109
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,480
Open the door!

110
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,539
Jiang Yingxian!

111
00:08:35,199 --> 00:08:39,479
Major, we've driven for so long, but we haven't seen anyone.

112
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:42,859
Perhaps your sister didn't take the main road, and used the mountain path instead.

113
00:08:42,859 --> 00:08:46,159
Are there any ferocious beasts or bandits around the mountains?

114
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:48,720
There aren't any beasts, but it's a chaotic time now.

115
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,139
There are many people who can't survive and become bandits.

116
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,679
All right.

117
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,020
Don't look around. Move.

118
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,619
Ba! Take a look at her.

119
00:09:14,619 --> 00:09:16,000
Don't let her get infected and die.

120
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,919
Otherwise, we would lose a lot.

121
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:21,940
Where's your wound?

122
00:09:35,739 --> 00:09:38,280
Ba. Hurry.

123
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,779
Come.

124
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:42,320
There were so many mines buried behind the mountains.

125
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,840
Didn't you know that?

126
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,739
Why did you still go there?

127
00:09:51,628 --> 00:09:53,287
Hold it!

128
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,739
Major, I didn't find her.

129
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:03,840
We'll search the mountain path.

130
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,499
- Split up.
- Yes, Major.

131
00:10:11,379 --> 00:10:12,580
- Stop! 
 - Stop!

132
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,702
- Don't run! 
 - Don't run!

133
00:10:13,702 --> 00:10:15,739
- Stop! 
 - After her!

134
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:18,519
- Stop! 
 - Wait!

135
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:21,499
We haven't scouted the forest ahead.

136
00:10:21,499 --> 00:10:22,940
I don't know if there are any mines.

137
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,519
Should we watch her escape and do nothing?

138
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,499
We'll take a detour.

139
00:10:27,499 --> 00:10:30,639
If she can escape the forest, we'll catch her.

140
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,439
 This area should be between Haicheng and Gangcheng. 

141
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:42,320
 I asked Fu Cheng to help Fu Zhi before this. 

142
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,340
 I should be able to meet Fu Cheng sooner if I head towards Haicheng. 

143
00:10:54,259 --> 00:10:56,019
- She's over there! 
 - Hold it.

144
00:10:56,019 --> 00:10:57,720
I think she stepped on a mine.

145
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,020
- How unlucky. 
 - What should we do?

146
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,739
Forget about her. She stepped on a mine.

147
00:11:02,739 --> 00:11:06,159
She'll still lose a limb or two if she survives. We can't get any money for her.

148
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:08,360
- Let's go. 
 - Yes.

149
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,060
Xiao Zhi!

150
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,779
Xiao Zhi!

151
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:57,539
Fu Zhi!

152
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,559
Xiao Zhi! Xiao Zhi!

153
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:06,940
- Fu Zhi! 
 - Fu Cheng.

154
00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:15,759
Yingxian.

155
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:21,460
- Why are you here?
- Don't come here.

156
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:26,200
I think I stepped on a mine.

157
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:35,940
Don't move.

158
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,659
Don't be afraid.

159
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:03,899
Is it a mine?

160
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,600
Yes.

161
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:17,539
How unexpected.

162
00:13:17,539 --> 00:13:20,250
I've been pursuing fame and fortune for 20 years,

163
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:23,490
but this is how I end up.

164
00:13:23,499 --> 00:13:26,519
Yingxian, listen to me.

165
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:29,139
You should go.

166
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:33,539
Later, I'll take your place.

167
00:13:33,539 --> 00:13:38,800
Stay as far away as possible, and protect yourself.

168
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,920
You'll take my place? What will you do?

169
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,040
Don't worry.

170
00:13:49,859 --> 00:13:52,940
Homemade mines are inaccurate.

171
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,240
There will be a delay of a second or two when it explodes.

172
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,510
If I can run away quickly,

173
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,650
only my legs will get hurt.

174
00:14:00,659 --> 00:14:02,580
Do you believe me?

175
00:14:06,619 --> 00:14:08,539
I believe you.

176
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:36,259
Fu Cheng.

177
00:14:36,259 --> 00:14:37,840
Take cover.

178
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:46,320
Fu Cheng. I've taken cover.

179
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:56,820
I'm going to jump!

180
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,480
Three! Two!

181
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,040
One!

182
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,220
Fu Cheng!

183
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,540
Fu Cheng!

184
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,759
It's all right. It's all right.

185
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:36,799
Didn't I tell you?

186
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:40,360
This is the thing I am experiencing every day.

187
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,360
Is this the life you've chosen?

188
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,039
Sacrificing your life to help warlords
take over each other's turfs.

189
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:48,980
You can just die at some random place

190
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,490
with no one to remember you when you die, right?

191
00:15:52,659 --> 00:15:54,700
Do you care about me then?

192
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,600
I thought you'd really die just now.

193
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:21,399
I thought I could no longer see you again.

194
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:51,050


195
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:05,260
 ♫ Promises were made, Moments were missed Sadness lingers ♫ 

196
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:13,220
 ♫ Aren't you the one Who pretends to be a stranger after falling in love? ♫ 

197
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:20,220
 ♫ I'm torn, not knowing what to choose Giving up and then picking it up again ♫ 

198
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:27,140
 ♫ What more do you want from me? If it's not enough, I'll fill it with persistence ♫ 

199
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:35,320
 ♫ How do I describe your silhouette? All you gave me was a love out of sync ♫ 

200
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:43,200
 ♫ The marks left behind are being pulled And finally torn apart ♫ 

201
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,040
 ♫ The fireworks cool the loneliness ♫ 

202
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:49,760
 ♫ Yet you ask me to keep safe ♫ 

203
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,520
 ♫ All my memories of you ♫ 

204
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,080
 ♫ Since I've loved, I have no choice ♫ 

205
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:01,320
 ♫ A firework Needs a promise to fall perfectly ♫ 

206
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:05,240
 ♫ Only the heartbroken
understand the marks left behind ♫ 

207
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,560
 ♫ Excuses aren't lacking ♫ 

208
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:12,180
 ♫ But only those who've loved
have the right to remain silent ♫ 

209
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:16,280
 ♫ It's not that I talk endlessly
to push away your reluctance ♫ 

210
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:20,160
 ♫ It's just that I'm tired and hurt,
leaving nothing behind ♫ 

211
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:27,920
 ♫ Isn't it natural to want
to keep loving what you've had? ♫ 

212
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:50,220
 ♫ How do I describe your silhouette? All you gave me was a love out of sync ♫ 

213
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:58,200
 ♫ The marks left behind are being pulled And finally torn apart ♫ 

214
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,100
 ♫ The fireworks cool the loneliness ♫ 

215
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:04,820
 ♫ Yet you ask me to keep safe ♫ 

216
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:08,520
 ♫ All my memories of you ♫ 

217
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:12,760
 ♫ Since I've loved, I have no choice ♫
