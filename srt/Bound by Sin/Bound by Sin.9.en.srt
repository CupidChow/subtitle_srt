192
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,480
What?

193
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,390
What happened?

194
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,390
Tell me!

195
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,790
Miss Jiang called me

196
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:49,960
on her way back from Pingcheng.

197
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,720
So I arranged for someone to meet her out of town.

198
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:54,240
But I didn't expect...

199
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,120
I didn't expect they would tell me

200
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:00,030
they saw her car

201
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,670
go straight down the cliff.

202
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,120
Master,

203
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:10,550

207
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,790
and had an accident

212

Why didn't she let me go with her?

No.

This won't do.

At this moment,

Fu Cheng doesn't know what is keeping him going.

I think it's you who plotted to murder Yingxian.

261
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,600
Haven't you always wanted her to make way?

262
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,440
So you could take over as the head of the family.

263
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,440
Jiang Yingqi.

264
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,840
I wouldn't argue with you,

265

but aren't you being too disrespectful?

I may be disrespectful,

267
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,150
but it's better than how you murdered your family.

268
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,840
Yingxian and I weren't born to the same mother as you.

269
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,670
So you keep making things hard for us.

270
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,240
Yingxian almost lost her life in Jiangbei Village.

271
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,270
I've found out it was you.

272
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:19,550
If Yingxian

273
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,000
didn't acknowledge you were family,

274
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,510
she would have called the police.

275
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,200
I'm not dead yet!

276
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:26,720
Father,

277
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:28,960
please have Yingxian's back.

278
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,390
You know exactly what happened in Jiangbei Village.

279
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,200
If we keep letting Yingjian do whatever he wants,

280
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,480
our family will never have peace.

281
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:37,200
Father,

282
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,120
I know Yingxian and Yingqi

283
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,320
aren't satisfied with me,

284
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,150
but I shouldn't be slandered like this.

285
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,030
Enough!

286
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,080
Do you think

287
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,720
I don't know what you did

288
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,720
behind my back?

289
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:54,600
If something really happens to Yingxian,

290
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:58,270
I will not let you get away.

291
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,270
So you know everything, huh?

292
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,960
Then why pretend you don't?

293
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,550
Do you think I'm ridiculous?

294
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,910
Or do you think

295
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:18,790
I'm just a useless piece of trash?

296
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:19,750
What are you doing?

297
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,320
What now, forcing Father

298
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,910
to pass the head of the family to you?

299
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:25,670
Get away!

300
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,600
You...!

301
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,480
Yeah.

302
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:34,480
I'm just the son of a country woman

303
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,630
that you had to marry.

304
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:38,790
And I have to marry an actress who's useless to the family.

305
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,200
So I don't deserve to be your son.

306
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,390
Father arranged a marriage for you.

307
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:45,870
You won't accept it.

308
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,750
Who are you trying to blame?

309
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:52,440
For years, I've been rebellious,

310
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,200
I've compromised,

311
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,840
or I've been obedient.

312
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,200
But no matter what I do,

313
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,910
Father has never really noticed me.

314
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,120
I am the eldest son.

315
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,390
Yet you'd rather pass on the family business to Jiang Yingxian,

316
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,000
a loose woman

317
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,440
who's out every night chasing pleasure,

318
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,550
than give it to me.

319
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:11,360
Why?

320
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:12,600
Why should she get it?

321
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,270
Just because she found a man

322
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,360
who can pull strings for her

323
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,720
and help her with things?

324
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,480
So,

325
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,440
you tried to murder Yingxian.

326
