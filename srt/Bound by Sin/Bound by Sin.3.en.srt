or is it just because of my relationship with Shen Dongyang?

191
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,480
I think

192
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,030
lands suit me more than jewelry.

193
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,750
Why my fiancée

194
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,390
is always such a disappointment?

195
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,750
I don't think it's time

196
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,270
for us to be so close.

197
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:21,750
What?

198
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:24,670
Stop pretending to be pure.

199
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,120
The whole Gangcheng

200
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:28,080
knows our Miss Jiang

201
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:30,080
is a womanizer.

202
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,600
When I had affairs with others,

203
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:35,080
I spent money on them.

204
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,440
But I've made large sums

205
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:42,630
of money for you.
