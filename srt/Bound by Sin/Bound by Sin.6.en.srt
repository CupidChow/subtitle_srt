You could have got off.

00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,160
Why did you save me?

5
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,480
I'll save everyone.

6
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:32,880
No matter who they are.

7
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,320
Come to be my bodyguard.

8
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,120
I can pay you

9
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,360
three times more than the Xu family does.

10
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,240
Aren't you afraid?

11
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,280
I may have an axe to grind.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,600
Don't trust others so easily.

13
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:57,520
Well.

14
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,080
Are you after the fortune of my family?

15
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,560
Or me?

16
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,600
Good night.

17
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,800
We shall talk about it tomorrow.

18
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,040
Boss, it probably isn't him.

19
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,920
It seems Fu Cheng's age is real.

20
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,040
So he can't be the one.

21
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:20,760
Yes.

22
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,400
Fu Cheng is older than him.

23
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,760
According to the investigation,

24
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,000
many old neighbors watched him grow up.

25
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,640
His age should be real.

26
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,960
You're truly a gentleman!

27
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,240
I'd like to see

28
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,120

It's Fu Cheng speaking.

33

I've read the newspaper.

37
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,560
It's a local gang

38
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,800
trying to blackmail the Jiang family

39
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,720
by inciting villagers to create chaos.

40
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,280
But there's no mention

41
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,880
of your disappearance.

42
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,600
The reputation of the Jiang family is supreme.

43
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,320
I'm no match for it.

the information to Mr. Yingqi.

126
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,880
You wanted him to expose Mr. Yingjian.

127
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,840
I never expected Yingqi could do

128
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,120
anything to Yingjian.

129
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,800
I just wanted to see how Father would react.

130

Now it's clear

131
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,280
that Father already knew

132
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,920
Yingjian had something to do with the incident.

133
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,440
But he wants the whole thing dropped.

134
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,280
So I said let it go.

135
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,200
It's in line with his mind.

136

Fu Cheng.

192
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,960
Wait for me outside.

193
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,400
It's safe here.

194
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,600
Have a seat.

195
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,560
Cheng.

196
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,840
I know you've always been kind and upright.

197
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,080
But you should know from the military

198
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,680
that kindness and uprightness

199
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,720
are not meant for enemies.

200
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:27,840
Uncle Fu.

201
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,080
All we know now is

202
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,720
that twenty years ago,

203
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,000
the Jiang family fished in troubled waters

204
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:34,640
by buying the Gu family at a low price...

205
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,600
The extermination of the entire Gu family

206
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:36,920
is the biggest gain

207
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,120
for the Jiang family.

208
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,520
Do you still think they are innocent?

209
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:50,640
Uncle Fu.

210
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,280
I know.

211
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,960
I'll try to get close to Jiang Yingxian.

212
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,520
The Jiangbei Village incident proves

213
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,560
that the Jiang family is cruel.

214
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,520
Jiang Yingxian would even risk her life

215
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,120
for the family's interests.

216
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,400
Is the misfortune of the Gu family

217
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,360
due to the Jiang family?

218
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,160
I have to figure it out.

219
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:22,000
Wow! Look at my former watchdog.

220
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,000
Now what?

221
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,640
You have the guts to come to Dance Hall

222
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,320
after leaving me?

223
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,560
Can you afford it?

224
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,840
Fu.

225
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,960
You're really good-looking.

226
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,080
Had you just been with me,

227
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,920
you wouldn't have to work so hard for my father.

228
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,640
We could have taken the money together,

229
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,720
and spent it however we wanted...

230
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,400
You...

231
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:54,800
I...

232
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,040
Excuse me.

233
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,160
Miss Xu?

234
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,920
I just saw Mr. Xu outside.

235
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,760
Is he here looking for you?

236
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:08,680
I...

237
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,080
None of you have seen me.

238
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,800
I have nothing to do with Xu Yawei.

239
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,080
It was an accident.

240
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,320
It really was.

241
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:32,720
I know.

242
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,080
But Mr. Fu,

243
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,320
why are you explaining to me?

244
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,640
Mr. Fu, you had a sweet dream.

245
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,240
I can tell it from the smile on your face.

246
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,480
Thank you for bringing me back last night

247
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,000
and staying on guard all night.

248
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,000
Set off now for the Trading Company now?

249
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,840
Spear me one second

250
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,000
to get washed.

251
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,840
Pure and innocent Mr. Fu.

252
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,280
It seems you had

253
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,840
a wet dream.

254
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,360
What am I doing?

255
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,160
Shame on me!

256
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,320
