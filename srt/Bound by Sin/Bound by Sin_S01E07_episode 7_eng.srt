Have a seat.

7
00:00:50,999 --> 00:00:54,719
Hello, Miss Jiang. I'm Zhou Xiao Qing.

8
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,940
Sorry to intrude today.

9
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,079
It's fine.

10
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:02,179
Miss Zhou, how can I help you?

11
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:11,060
Miss Jiang, I know you and Dong Yang are engaged,
but he doesn't love you.

12
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:12,860
He never has.

13
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:17,179
If he did,
he wouldn't have been with me for so long.

14
00:01:17,179 --> 00:01:20,020
Miss Jiang, I just don't get it.

15
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,530
Why would someone as wealthy as you

16
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,600
choose to be with a man who doesn't love you?

17
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:32,040
Miss Jiang, please, let him be with me.

18
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,700
Miss Zhou, please get up.

19
00:01:43,099 --> 00:01:47,220
Miss Zhou, what's your definition of wealth?

20
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,920
Money is money only within a certain range.

21
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,760
Miss Jiang, I don't understand what you mean.

22
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:04,500
Once it goes beyond that range,
it's no longer just money.

23
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,439
It's a person's entire life at stake.

24
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:09,380
No one would give up their own life willingly.

25
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:13,179
I won't, and Shen Dong Yang
certainly won't either.

26
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,639
Miss Zhou, please leave.

27
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:25,100
I always do everything he says.

28
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:34,499
I wear whatever he tells me to wear,
and speak the way he likes.

29
00:02:35,899 --> 00:02:38,619
Am I not doing a good job of imitating her?

30
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:47,079
Miss Zhou, what did you mean by that?

31
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:49,100
Who are you imitating?

32
00:02:50,899 --> 00:02:53,140
I can't break up with him.

33
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,239
He cares about me.

34
00:02:55,239 --> 00:02:58,359
- I must head back now and behave myself.
- Ke Rui,

35
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,860
see Miss Zhou out.

36
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:04,020
Let's go, Miss Zhou.

38

What rouge and perfume
has Miss Jiang been using lately?

39
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:20,760
I can't tell you.

40
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,190
Miss Zhou, since you've chosen to be a mistress,

41
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:26,420
learn not to overstep your boundaries.

42
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,980
Take care.

47
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:49,559
 Up until now, Zhou Xiao Qing
still doesn't understand what she did wrong 

48
00:03:49,559 --> 00:03:53,139
 or why Shen Dong Yang suddenly turned on her. 

49
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:54,520
 That morning, 

50
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,440
 she and Shen Dong Yang had breakfast together for the first time in ages, 

51
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,280
 so sweet it felt like they were
just any ordinary couple.

 ♫ I might as well forget my wandering days ♫

Dong Yang, how often do you see your fiancée
in a year?

54
00:04:12,359 --> 00:04:14,380
Not as much as I see you.

55
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:17,979
What does she look like?

56
00:04:17,979 --> 00:04:19,999
Is she as pretty as me?

57
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,720
Answer me. What does she look like?

58
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,600
Is she as pretty as me?

59
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,600
Is she ugly?

60
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,220
Is that why she never shows her face?

Why aren't you saying anything?

00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,859
Is she cheating on you?

65
00:04:47,859 --> 00:04:52,339
Did you have me dress up like her
because she won't let you touch her?

66
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,859
Zhou Xiao Qing, stop being such a lunatic.

67
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,219
Shen Dong Yang, stop right there!

68
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:05,979
If you walk out that door today,
don't ever come back to me.

69
00:05:05,979 --> 00:05:09,200
There are plenty of rich, powerful men chasing after me,

70
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,980
and none of them are as twisted as you!

00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,500
 That was just angry talk. 

74
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,679
 I just wanted to hear him say, "You're beautiful." 

75
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,679
What is it?

76
00:05:42,679 --> 00:05:46,559
Are you going to lecture me again, Mr. Fu?

77
00:05:47,559 --> 00:05:50,840
So, you're marrying
Shen Dong Yang no matter what, right?

78
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,419
Is there something wrong with that?

79
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:55,270
Even if he's been hurting you,

80
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:58,239
fooling around with women, causing scandals,

81
00:05:58,239 --> 00:06:01,559
and getting another woman to dress up like you?

82
00:06:01,559 --> 00:06:03,519
Don't you find that...

83
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,299
What?

84
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:09,879
Disgusting?

85
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:17,559
Mr. Fu, you really are quite naive.

86
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,090
The purer someone is,

87
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:28,620
the more it makes people want to destroy them.

88
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,199
Do you like them?

89
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,459
Do you know what I do, looking at these photos,

Granduncle!

113
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,160
- Let's talk over there.
- Alright.

114
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,479
Have a seat.

115
00:09:07,457 --> 00:09:09,097
Be careful.

116
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:16,419
Isn't this all such a headache?

 The more time I spend with Jiang Ying Xian, the more I find myself naturally respecting her, 

120
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,720
 admiring her, and feeling for her.

 She's nothing like the rich young ladies
I've known. 

125
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,899
 Her time and energy 

126
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:42,960
 are all devoted to the Jiang family. 
 

127

128
00:11:09,299 --> 00:11:13,899
Ke Rui told me you went out,
but I knew I'd find you here.

129
00:11:13,899 --> 00:11:17,199
As expected, we are in tune with each other.

130
00:11:17,199 --> 00:11:20,240
You seem eager to see me.
Let's talk upstairs.

131
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,320
I came to apologize,

132
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,500
and I hope you can spare some time to have dinner with me.

133
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,420
It would be my honor.

134
00:11:30,939 --> 00:11:36,120
In that case, Mr. Fu,
please let me take over from here.

135
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,939
Let us, as an engaged couple,
have some time alone.

136
00:11:43,037 --> 00:11:46,397
Mr. Fu, you can leave early today.

137
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,160
 

138
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,700
I only ordered this today.

139
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,620
- You don't mind, do you?
- Of course not.

140
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:54,200
Zhou Xiao Qing came to see you a few days ago,
right?

141
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,280
Yes.

142
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,199
 Is Shen Dong Yang mad? 

143
00:12:59,199 --> 00:13:01,120
 Is he unhappy with how I reacted? 

144
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,779
 Why? 

145
00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:04,220
This is your personal matter.

146
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:10,660
I shouldn't interfere,
but I do think you could've handled it better.

147
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:15,160
Well... You haven't changed at all,
Jiang Ying Xian.

148
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:19,959
But she told me everything
you two talked about.

149
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:21,479
Oh, did she?

150
00:13:21,479 --> 00:13:23,280
 I see. 

151
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:27,079
 As his fiancée,
when his mistress showed up at my door, 

152
00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:29,920
 I was supposed to be angry, upset, 

153
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,579
 or at least throw out a few sarcastic remarks, 

154
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:35,939
 even though that would only annoy him. 

155
00:13:35,939 --> 00:13:40,220
 The point is, in his eyes,
there can only be people who are rejected by him, 

156
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,500
 not the other way around. 

157
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:52,319
Did you tell her
your life is on the line because of me?

158
00:13:52,319 --> 00:13:54,120
Yes.

159
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,100
Isn't that true?

160
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,340
Good. Straightforward as always.

161
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:03,039
It suits our relationship,
which is based on mutual benefits.

162
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:06,899
There are ways to handle a relationship
built on interests,

163
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:11,280
and there are ways to handle one based on love.

164
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,360
Ying Xian...

165
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,820
how do you want to handle ours?

166
00:14:18,439 --> 00:14:21,430
 If I can't fall in love with Shen Dong Yang, then 

167
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:24,850
 I'll have no choice but to stick to the former. 

168
00:14:25,439 --> 00:14:29,959
 I hope my self-punishment will be enough
to make him drop the topic. 

169
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,340
 ♫ I don't have the courage
to face the scars of the past ♫ 

170
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,580
 ♫ After all this time, I'm still not over her ♫ 

171
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,940
 ♫ I ask myself, am I at peace? ♫ 

172
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:40,240
 ♫ Can I let go? Do I regret it? ♫ 

173
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,080
 ♫ But time can never turn back ♫ 

174
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:48,480
 ♫ I can only carry these memories
and meet her in my dreams ♫ 

175
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:04,560
 ♫ Imagination and reality are always at odds ♫ 

176
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,760
 ♫ Plans can never keep up with changes ♫ 

177
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,320
 ♫ There's nothing we can do about it ♫ 

178
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,860
 ♫ We tell the ones we love
that we've never loved them ♫ 

179
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,520
 ♫ We act clueless
in front of those we don't love ♫ 

180
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,820
 ♫ Listening to those who don't love us ♫ 

181
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:23,100
 ♫ Saying how much they love us with sweet words ♫ 

182
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,960
 ♫ Have I moved on? Should I let go? ♫ 

183
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,760
 ♫ Is she still in my heart? ♫ 

184
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,460
 ♫ I don't have the courage
to face the scars of the past ♫ 

185
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:34,520
 ♫ After all this time, I'm still not over her ♫ 

186
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,400
 ♫ Can I let go? Do I regret it? ♫ 

187
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,140
 ♫ But time can never turn back ♫ 

188
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:45,740
 ♫ I can only carry these memories
and meet her in my dreams ♫ 

189
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,340
 ♫ I don't have the courage
to face the scars of the past ♫ 

190
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:57,420
 ♫ After all this time, I'm still not over her ♫ 

191
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,100
Enough, Jiang Ying Xian.

192
00:16:06,439 --> 00:16:08,260
Stop drinking.

193
00:16:09,479 --> 00:16:12,579
Have you had your fill, Mr. Shen?

194
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,340
I brought this from Haicheng.

195
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,260
You haven't eaten anything today.

196
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,380
Take it home. Have it as a late-night snack.

197
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,179
You could've smoothed things over
with a few sweet words,

198
00:16:32,179 --> 00:16:35,990
but no, you chose to drink

199
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:38,590
and throw soft jabs at me.

200
00:16:38,599 --> 00:16:41,500
What a troublesome personality.

201
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,179
Thank you for the gift.

202
00:16:44,179 --> 00:16:46,160
Let me walk you home.

203
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,640
It's okay.

204
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,380
Ke Rui will take me back.

205
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:16,420
Zhou Xiao Qing
really doesn't deserve any sympathy.

206
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:19,660
The moment she saw him,
she sold me out completely.

207
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:23,600
Her tears are genuine,
but her manipulations are real too.

208
00:17:26,399 --> 00:17:29,220
Shen Dong Yang and I are no different.

209
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:34,760
We look decent on the outside,
but inside, we're both falling apart.

210
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:39,380
I'm worse than Shen Dong Yang,

211
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,900
but no one knows.

212
00:17:45,339 --> 00:17:48,859
No, there's one person who knows.

213
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,919
Hi.

214
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,959
You look like the person I was talking about.

215
00:18:04,299 --> 00:18:06,020
Get on.

216
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:09,740
Why? Who do you think you are?

217
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,299
I'm Fu Cheng.

218
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:14,090
Jiang Ying Xian, get on.

219
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:23,030
 Timing and Subtitles by the 
⛓️ The Sinful Team 💞 

220
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,209
 ♫ Promises were made. Moments were missed ♫ 

221
00:18:43,209 --> 00:18:46,400
 ♫ Sadness lingers ♫ 

222
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,800
 ♫ Aren't you the one ♫ 

223
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:54,880
 ♫ Who pretends to be a stranger
after falling in love? ♫ 

224
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,860
 ♫ I'm torn, not knowing what to choose ♫ 

225
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:01,900
 ♫ Giving up and then picking it up again ♫ 

226
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,900
 ♫ What more do you want from me? ♫ 

227
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:08,780
 ♫ If it's not enough,
I'll fill it with persistence ♫ 

228
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,600
 ♫ How do I describe your silhouette? ♫ 

229
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,980
 ♫ All you gave me was a love out of sync ♫ 

230
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,680
 ♫ The marks left behind are being pulled ♫ 

231
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:24,840
 ♫ And finally torn apart ♫ 

232
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,680
 ♫ The fireworks cool the loneliness ♫ 

233
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:31,505
 ♫ Yet you ask me to keep safe ♫ 

234
00:19:31,505 --> 00:19:35,160
 ♫ All my memories of you ♫ 

235
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,720
 ♫ Since I've loved, I have no choice ♫ 

236
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:43,020
 ♫ A firework ♫  
  ♫ Needs a promise to fall perfectly ♫ 

237
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:46,980
 ♫ Only the heartbroken
understand the marks left behind ♫ 

238
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,200
 ♫ Excuses aren't lacking ♫ 

239
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:55,120
 ♫ But only those who've loved
have the right to remain silent ♫
