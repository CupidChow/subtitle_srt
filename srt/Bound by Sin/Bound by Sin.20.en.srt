[Episode 20]

12
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,430
We are asked to guard the rich man's house,

13
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,510
but we can't take action.

14
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,070
I wonder what the Governor wants.

15
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,760
We just do what our superior asks for.

16
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,680
We don't even know who our commander will be tomorrow.

17
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,680
Just don't cause trouble.

18
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,750
Who's there?

19
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,310
Ke Rui, it's me.

20
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,630
Boss,

21
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:33,430
you're back.

22
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,360
Yingxian.

23
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,280
You are finally back.

24
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,310
Why are the lights off at home?

25
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,080
The power lines around the place have been cut.

26
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,590
It's chaotic right now

27
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,630
and no one is coming to fix it.

28
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:46,630
When I entered the city,

29
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,360
I heard about Gangcheng's situation.

30
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,360
When I got around the wall to come inside,

31
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,360
I saw guards keeping watch outside.

32
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,870
What's going on at the house now?

33
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,030
All of us are fine.

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,630
Governor Jin doesn't allow people to plunder our house

35
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,960
but he also stops us from going out.

36
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,870
I still don't know what's going on

37
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,750
at Uncles' houses.

38
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,030
Yingxian,

39
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,560
didn't you two come from the Revolutionary Army?

40
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,240
Did you ask them to save us?

41
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,800
I sent the message to them

42
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,840
but I don't know

43
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,560
whether the army will come or not.

44
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,240
Yingxian, what should we do?

45
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:22,190
Are we just going to succumb to fate?

46
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,960
I heard about Governor Jin.

47
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,470
He might be sent here by the Central Government,

48
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,680
but he has a neutral opinion

49
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,680
on the Revolutionary Army.

50
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,630
Governor Jin doesn't allow others to hurt us.

51
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,680
We should be fine for now.

52
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,710
It seems like

53
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,080
he has an ulterior motive.

54
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:48,280
Tomorrow,

55
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,520
I'll go and meet Governor Jin.

56
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,750
Officers, please send a message.

57
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:02,000
I hope to meet Governor Jin.

58
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:02,840
Who are you?

59
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,430
Do you think you can meet Governor Jin as you wish?

60
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:07,150
I am the head of the Jiang family, Jiang Yingxian.

61
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,910
We can help you send the message

62
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,190
but whether Governor Jin meets you or not

63
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:14,430
is out of our control.

64
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:15,750
Thank you.

65
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,270
Miss Jiang.

66
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,630
It has been so long.

67
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,680
I wonder why you are asking

68
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:23,920
to meet me today.

69
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'm only asking to meet you

70
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:28,750
for one purpose, Governor Jin.

71
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,950
To secure a better future for the Jiang family.

72
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:35,680
I wonder what you are planning, Miss Jiang.

73
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:37,830
You should know

74
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:39,390
that merchants

75
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,720
can only make money when the social environment

76
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:42,870
is safe.

77
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,160
Previously, Commander Chen allowed smuggling among his subordinates

78
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,360
and the Nan Army's discipline was a mess.

79
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,600
So, the Central Government sent you to supervise.

80
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,870
Getting rid of Commander Chen

81
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,360
is a great help to the people.

82
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,560
It makes everyone happy.

83
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,070
However,

84
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,430
Commander Chen

85
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,870
is the president's relative after all.

86
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,720
You should be worried about your future, right?

87
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,190
I believe

88
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,040
you are different from Commander Chen,

89
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:12,870
Governor Jin.

90
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,680
The Jiang family

91
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,720
is also hoping to serve you

92
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,600
under your governance.

93
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,950
However, I was wondering

94
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:22,190
which path you would lead us to.

95
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,160
Miss Jiang,

96
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,510
are you teaching me how to do things?

97
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,070
You've misunderstood.

98
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,360
I'm just an ordinary civilian.

99
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,000
I dare not teach you how to do things.

100
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:34,630
However,

101
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,190
we also hope

102
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:39,270
to have a long-lasting relationship with you.

103
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,560
Ask the person supporting you to come here.

104
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,270
This isn't something

105
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,680

I still need to report the details to my superior

113
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,040
