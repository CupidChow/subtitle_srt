What do you say?

191
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,150
Find a chance to run.

192
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:42,670
No need.

193
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:44,960
We didn't close the deal this time,

194
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,510
but we can try again next time.

195
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,390
You think you can just leave?

196
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:53,270
Let's go.

197
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:56,200
Ke Rui!

198
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,200
Don't let them get away!

199
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:57,840
Get up!

200
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:58,600
Go after them!

201
00:14:58,910 --> 00:14:59,360
Hurry!

202
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:01,270
You go first!

203
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,720
Their people are everywhere.

204
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:03,720
Even if I leave first,

205
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:04,750
where can I escape to?

206
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:05,670
Come on.

207
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:15,840
It's the military!

208
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:16,960
Retreat!

209
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:18,600
Stop!

210
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:19,390
Freeze!

211
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:19,910
Get down!

212
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:20,510
Don't move!

213
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,550
Major Cheng,

214
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,030
there are two ladies here.

215
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,440
One of them has a leg injury

216
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:29,150
and needs a stretcher.

217
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,320
Is it serious?

218
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,910
I'm not injured. Ke Rui is.

219
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,960
Take them back to the camp.
