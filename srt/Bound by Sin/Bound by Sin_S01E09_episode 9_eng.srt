1
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:11,260
   

2
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:13,980
   

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,240
So, Shen Dongyang never asked you to send it.

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,290
He only asked you to contact Fu Cheng,

5
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:23,830
and tell him that it was me who asked him to do it.

6
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,639
Since when has Shen Dongyang become so immature?

7
00:00:29,639 --> 00:00:32,359
Boss, why didn't you bring Fu Cheng with you?

8
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:34,359
With him around, it would always be safer.

9
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:37,420
He left before the banquet even ended.

10
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:43,039
Well, men are just like that. They get jealous easily.

11
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:44,800
If you keep spouting nonsense,

12
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,880
I'll send you back to Japan to study for a few more years.

13
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,219
I'm sorry. Please don't, Boss.

14
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:55,260
Don't separate me from the food of our homeland.

15
00:00:57,639 --> 00:00:59,579
- Revitalize China! 
  - Revitalize China! 

16
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:01,599
- Hello, please take a look. 
 - Sir, please have a look.

17
00:01:01,599 --> 00:01:04,600
Here. China's rise! 
    

18
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,579
Hello. Hello, please take a look. 
    

19
00:01:07,579 --> 00:01:09,760
Never forget national humiliation. Revitalize China.

20
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,500
Sir, please take a look at this.

21
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,979
Excuse me. Please take a look.

22
00:01:12,979 --> 00:01:15,939
"Revitalize China. Never forget national humiliation."

23
00:01:15,939 --> 00:01:17,852
Hello, please take a look.

24
00:01:17,852 --> 00:01:19,719
"Revitalize China. Never forget national humiliation."

25
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:22,283
The student handing out flyers is Jiang Yingsi.

26
00:01:22,283 --> 00:01:25,519
Never forget national humiliation. Please have a look!

27
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:27,200
China's rise.

28
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,999
- Please have a look. 
 - Hello, please take a look.

29
00:01:28,999 --> 00:01:31,519
 - Revitalize China.  
 - Jiang Yingsi.

30
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:34,840
 - I pledge my life...  
 - Sir, please take a look.

31
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,580
 - To protect China.  
 - Please have a look.

32
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:38,480
 To protect China! 

33
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,040
Miss, please have a look.

34
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,900
Miss, did you call me?

35
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:47,940
You're... Jiang Yingsi?

36
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,680
 Please have a look. 

37
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,279
 - Never forget national humiliation! 
 - Never forget national humiliation! 

38
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:55,620
 Sir, "Revitalize China. Never forget national humiliation." 

39
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,360
Her identity has been confirmed. It is her.

40
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,470
 Timing and Subtitles by the 
⛓️ The Sinful Team 💞 

41
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:10,900
Pretty lady, are you really my sister?

42
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,600
Now that you know your background,

43
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,600
if you have any needs, I can go and ask Father to help you.

44
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,440
Just knowing I have such a beautiful sister makes me happy.

45
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,259
Would you like to meet Father and the rest of the family?

46
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,519
I'm doing well.

47
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:32,299
I don't want to disturb your life, nor do I want you to disturb mine.

48
00:02:32,299 --> 00:02:36,779
It's an honor to meet such a beautiful and independent woman like you.

49
00:02:37,559 --> 00:02:41,020
And now, I must go and do the most important thing in my life.

50
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,880
   

51
00:02:56,354 --> 00:02:58,039
   

52
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:02,079
 A beautiful and independent woman. 

53
00:03:02,079 --> 00:03:05,360
 That's quite new. 

54
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:12,759
Mr. Fu.

55
00:03:13,839 --> 00:03:15,720
Miss Jiang hasn't come back yet.

56
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,260
She didn't mention when she'd be back?

57
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,619
No, she didn't.

58
00:03:19,619 --> 00:03:23,999
There has been a backlog of files for her to process.

59
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:27,639
 With Jiang Yingxian out,  

60
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:28,850
 Fu Cheng feels this could be an opportunity 

61
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:32,510
 to investigate what truly happened back then. 

62
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:34,179
Thank you.

63
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,239
   

64
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:46,959
Subtly let my eldest brother know that we just went to Pingcheng.

65
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,052
Why let him know?

66
00:03:49,052 --> 00:03:51,119
   

67
00:03:51,119 --> 00:03:52,550
This is strange.

68
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:57,550
Who could have the guts to mess up your desk?

69
00:04:03,559 --> 00:04:06,720
Though Jiang Yingsi isn't much of a threat now,

70
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,040
we can't be sure that my eldest brother won't rise up again.

71
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:14,239
I thought Old Master hinted that if you married into the Shen family,

72
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,059
you could be the head of the family.

73
00:04:18,059 --> 00:04:19,720
Nothing is finalized.

74
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,960
There can always be change.

75
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:26,600
You must always be fully prepared to stand a greater chance.

76
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,140
This time, I will make sure Jiang Yingjian

77
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:33,260
is disqualified from becoming the head for good.

78
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,959
This is what we've found about Shen Dongyang.

79
00:04:42,459 --> 00:04:44,480
Are you not going to take a look?

80
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:48,319
This guy has done quite a lot of things.

81
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:50,160
Uncle Fu,

82
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,959
are you hiding something from me?

83
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,770
A'Cheng, what do you mean?

84
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:00,170
Was the Gu family's disaster

85
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:03,750
really caused by Jiang Zhen?

86
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,439
It was he who took advantage of the situation.

87
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:13,099
That's how he built up the Jiang family's wealth.

88
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,820
Jiang Zhen took advantage of the chaos.

89
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,439
But who caused it?

90
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:22,920
And who led him to us,

91
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,830
opened the door for him,

92
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:29,640
allowing him to make it even worse?

93
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,480
A'Cheng...

94
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,979
- You... 
 - Leave.

95
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,999
Don't mention anything about avenging the Gu family again.

96
00:05:37,999 --> 00:05:40,040
A'Cheng,

97
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,990
hear me out.

98
00:05:41,999 --> 00:05:44,720
It's not what you think it is.

99
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,959
I've heard enough from you!

100
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:50,539
I don't want to hear any more of this.

101
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:55,840
Go.

102
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:25,119
Yingxian, go handle this by yourself.

103
00:06:25,119 --> 00:06:28,120
Bring the child back safely.

104
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,659
Father, I'll leave now.

105
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:40,359
I'll be back by tonight at the earliest.

106
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:43,219
Good. The sooner, the better.

107
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,299
Father, I'll go see Second Sister off.

108
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,999
Second Sister.

109
00:07:02,999 --> 00:07:05,140
Second Sister.

110
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,520
Are you dumb?

111
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,599
Why are you bringing the child back yourself?

112
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,640
How did you know?

113
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:15,279
Even I know you and Ke Rui went to Pingcheng.

114
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:18,040
That person must know as well.

115
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:22,640
Father, you must have some good news.

116
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,740
Stay for tonight.

117
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,119
We'll have dinner together.

118
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,259
Don't worry about it. Just do your own job.

119
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:36,186
So you're still going?

120
00:07:36,186 --> 00:07:38,119
I know what I'm doing.

121
00:07:38,119 --> 00:07:40,559
Don't do anything unnecessary.

122
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,240
You fool!

123
00:08:01,539 --> 00:08:04,640
Father, how about we eat first?

124
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,659
We can wait while eating.

125
00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:08,239
Maybe Second Sister has eaten on the way back.

126
00:08:08,239 --> 00:08:11,159
Yeah. There's soup simmering in the kitchen.

127
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:13,940
Even if she hasn't eaten, there's food.

128
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,520
Why the rush?

129
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,379
Wait one more quarter of an hour.

130
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:24,419
If they're still not back by then, you two can eat first.

131
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,160
Master.

132
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:35,000
They're back?

133
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,439
Where's Yingxian?

134
00:08:36,439 --> 00:08:39,960
Boss... I mean, Miss Jiang's car broke down

135
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:43,880
on the way back and went off a cliff.

136
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,920
- What? 
 - What happened? Tell me!

137
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,280
Miss Jiang called me on her way back from Pingcheng.

138
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,419
So I arranged for someone to meet her out of town.

139
00:08:53,419 --> 00:08:54,760
But I didn't expect...

140
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,120
I didn't expect they would tell me

141
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,340
they saw her car go

142
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:03,890
straight down the cliff.

143
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:11,550
Old Master, Mr. Fu came to meet Second Miss Jiang.

144
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:25,780
♫  If snow was winter's poem  ♫

145
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:28,840
Mr. Fu,

146
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,360
Boss did go to Pingcheng by herself

147
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,400
and had an accident on her way back.

148
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:40,420
♫  If longing was everything about you  ♫

149
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:48,060
Master has asked people to contact the police

150
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:51,079
to search the area down the cliff.

151
00:09:51,079 --> 00:09:54,100
Why didn't she let me go with her?

152
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:56,630
As as her bodyguard,

153
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:59,790
it's my duty...

154
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,120
to protect her.

155
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,799
- I... 
 - Mr. Fu, please calm down.

156
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:07,679
Boss is still unaccounted for.

157
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:10,130
- She may not... 
 - A person like her

158
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:13,290
would never just...

159
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:23,240
No. This won't do.

160
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,851
I must find her.

161
00:10:24,851 --> 00:10:28,280
Mr. Fu, please calm down first.

162
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,099
I must find her.

163
00:10:31,319 --> 00:10:33,419
I must find her.

164
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:40,040
 At this moment, Fu Cheng doesn't know what is keeping him going. 

165
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,640
 He still holds on to a sliver of will. 

166
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:48,699
 Has anyone ever told you that your back is like a ruler? 

167
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:57,039
 Although I've been with one man after another, I'm only like this with you. 

168
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:05,920
♫  Memories are always recalled unprompted  ♫

169
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:14,020
♫  That winter, I said I loved you  ♫

170
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:18,330
♫  Even if the snow falls ten thousand times  ♫

171
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:25,740
 Perhaps, it's because he hasn't done the things that normal couples do with Jiang Yingxian. 

172
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:29,319
 He hasn't confessed his true feelings to her. 

173
00:11:29,319 --> 00:11:32,380
 He hasn't made any promises to her. 

174
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:40,120
 In such chaotic times, people need promises more than ever. 

175
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:46,580
♫  The wooden bench at the end of the street  ♫

176
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:50,040
♫  Still remembers our last embrance   ♫

177
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:56,920
♫  As we say goodbye, before turning away and leaving  ♫

178
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:06,640
♫  The tears that burned ten thousand times  ♫

179
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:15,340
♫  Fell in the white snow and turned into a fish  ♫

180
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:19,740
♫  Swimming through the passage of time  ♫

181
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:25,200
 Jiang Yingxian, you've lied to me again. 

182
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,000
Father, please don't worry too much.

183
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,799
There isn't any confirmed information yet.

184
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:50,319
Even if... Even if Second Sister has really passed on, I'm still here.

185
00:12:50,319 --> 00:12:53,319
I will hold up the family.

186
00:12:53,319 --> 00:12:55,880
I think it's you who plotted to murder my second sister.

187
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,799
Haven't you always wanted her to make way?

188
00:12:57,799 --> 00:13:00,240
So you could take over as the head of the family.

189
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,120
Jiang Yingqi.

190
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:05,620
I typically wouldn't argue with you, but aren't you being too disrespectful?

191
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:10,020
I may be disrespectful, but it's better than how you murdered your family.

192
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,120
Second Sister and I weren't born to the same mother as you.

193
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,040
So you keep making things hard for us.

194
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,400
Second Sister almost lost her life in Jiangbei Village.

195
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,799
I've long known that it was your doing.

196
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:22,879
If Second Sister didn't acknowledge that you were family, she would have called the police.

197
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:25,220
I'm not dead yet!

198
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,400
Father, please speak up for Second Sister.

199
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,980
You know exactly what happened in Jiangbei Village.

200
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:36,599
If we keep letting Eldest Brother do whatever he wants, our family will never have peace.

201
00:13:36,599 --> 00:13:40,479
Father, I know Yingxian and Yingqi aren't satisfied with me,

202
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:42,280
but I shouldn't be slandered like this.

203
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,059
Enough!

204
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:50,540
Do you think I don't know what little tricks you've been doing behind my back?

205
00:13:51,579 --> 00:13:56,190
If something really happened to Yingxian this time,

206
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:59,290
I will not let you get away.

207
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,099
So you know everything, huh?

208
00:14:09,439 --> 00:14:12,730
Then why pretend you don't?

209
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:16,879
Do you think I'm ridiculous?

210
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:20,820
- Or do you think I'm just a useless piece of trash? 
 - What are you doing?

211
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:24,839
What now, are you forcing Father to pass the head of the family to you?

212
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:26,360
Get away!

213
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,720
You...

214
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:32,319
Yeah.

215
00:14:32,319 --> 00:14:36,179
I'm just the son of a country woman that you had to marry.

216
00:14:36,179 --> 00:14:39,380
And I wanted to marry an actress who's useless to the family.

217
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:42,720
So I don't deserve to be your son.

218
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,799
Father arranged a marriage for you.

219
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:46,640
You won't accept it.

220
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,679
Who are you trying to blame?

221
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:56,899
For years, I've been rebellious, I've compromised, and I've been obedient.

222
00:14:56,899 --> 00:15:00,599
But no matter what I do, Father has never really noticed me.

223
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:03,120
I am the eldest son.

224
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,000
Yet you'd rather pass on the family business to Jiang Yingxian,

225
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,599
a loose woman who's out every night chasing pleasure, rather than giving it to me.

226
00:15:10,599 --> 00:15:13,040
Why? Why should she get it?

227
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,640
Just because she found a man who can pull strings for her and help her with things?

228
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,460
So, you...

229
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:29,460
tried to murder Yingxian.

230
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,899
You wretch!

231
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,740
You like how Jiang Yingxian makes money for you, don't you?

232
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,680
You'll never see her again.

233
00:15:49,479 --> 00:15:54,200
And you will never see...

234
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,440
the illegitimate child you care about.

235
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,579
You also murdered...

236
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:10,319
Are you out of your mind?

237
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:12,779
 Second Miss is back! 

238
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,899
Second Sister!

239
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:30,200
Eldest Brother, you really should stop.

240
