00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:31,680
 ♫ Drifting aimlessly Not knowing where to go ♫ 

3
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:37,040
 ♫ The moonlight tonight feels sorrowful ♫ 

4
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:42,780
 ♫ I stand alone against it ♫ 

5
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,980
 ♫ But I don't want to ♫ 

6
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:51,780
 ♫ The longing catches me off guard ♫ 

7
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:59,380
 ♫ To the silent night, I surrender myself ♫ 

8
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:09,980
 ♫ Tossing and turning, lost in confusion  In the darkness, I lose my way ♫ 

9
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:33,300
   

10
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,519
 

11
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:38,580
Yingqi sneaked back.

12
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,020
Have someone keep an eye on him.

13
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:48,500
I want to see what the two of them are up to.

14
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,460
I had someone follow him when I spotted him yesterday.

15
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,960
Still no word from Fu Cheng?

16
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,300
No. It's chaos outside Gangcheng right now.

17
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:03,719
We've had to pull back from all the outside markets,

18
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:06,740
so it's hard to keep track of things out there.

19
00:02:16,235 --> 00:02:21,076
I wonder how long this war will drag on.

20
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,272
I've heard that Revolutionary Army is being organized all over the country.

21
00:02:32,272 --> 00:02:36,639
I'm not sure if Commander Chen's troops can handle them.

22
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:44,200
If they can, Commander Chen will keep squeezing us for military funds.

23
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:49,100
If not, they'll just bring in a new commander to do the same.

24
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,820
It's all the same to us.

25
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:51,308
Yingxian?

26
00:03:51,308 --> 00:03:52,920
Yingxian!

27
00:04:07,066 --> 00:04:09,559
Yingxian. Yingxian!

28
00:04:09,559 --> 00:04:12,320
Yingxian! Yingxian!

29
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:18,139
- Yingxian! 
 - Yingxian!

30
00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:01,299
 Yingxian, I hope this letter finds you well. 

31
00:05:01,299 --> 00:05:06,380
 I know my sudden departure must have caused you confusion and worry, 

32
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:09,479
 but please allow me to explain. 

33
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,020
 

34
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,720
It's from Fu Cheng. He says he left without saying goodbye because the army needs him.

35
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,559
I'm sure there's more to it than just that.

36
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,119
Boss, your third eldest granduncle is here.

37
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,040
Let him in.

38
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:53,320
Third Granduncle, you know why I asked you to come over, right?

39
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:58,339
Second Child, what's this about?

40
00:05:58,339 --> 00:06:00,860
Why did you call me over this early?

41
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,040
Don't you know?

42
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,640
What, didn't Yingqi talk things through with you?

43
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,620
How...

44
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,479
How did you know?

45
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,840
Yingqi is my brother.

46
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:18,400
I know how his mind works.

47
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,359
I didn't make any firm promises to Yingqi.

48
00:06:20,359 --> 00:06:22,540
I'll turn him down when I get back.

49
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,420
That's not what I meant, Third Granduncle.

50
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:30,199
I'm asking you to say yes.

51
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:37,320
Don't drag me into this mess between you and your brother.

52
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,960
My third eldest granduncle is on board.

53
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,280
He said he'd recommend me to be the family head at the end-of-year family meeting.

54
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,240
As for the other granduncles, they didn't take a clear stand,

55
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,219
but I can tell from their tone that they're on my side.

56
00:06:57,219 --> 00:06:59,380
Congratulations, Young Master Jiang.

57
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,720
Doesn't this all feel too easy?

58
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,530
I almost can't believe it.

59
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:09,339
Don't worry, Young Master Jiang.

60
00:07:09,339 --> 00:07:13,380
Whatever tricks Jiang Yingxian has up her sleeve, I've got a plan.

61
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,060
Really?

62
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:23,932
Then here's to us getting what we want.

63
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,960
Boss, all the uncles have replied.

64
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,520
They'll go along with what you suggested.

65
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:48,080
Boss, won't Youngest Young Master's tricks fail if we just bring him back?

66
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,640
Why go through all this trouble and put on a show?

67
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,720
He needs to suffer a big loss first to understand

68
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:02,339
that nothing in this world can be done by just talking.

69
00:08:02,339 --> 00:08:08,620
Otherwise, even if I stop him this time, he'll keep creating trouble.

70
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:14,640
Besides, I want to see what Fu Zhi is really up to.

71
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,519
Boss, there's a telegram from Haicheng. 
    

72
00:08:26,066 --> 00:08:28,385
What's wrong?

73
00:08:28,385 --> 00:08:30,559
Fu Cheng's seriously ill.

74
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,900
I need to go to Haicheng.

75
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,240
The family meeting is tomorrow.

76
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,859
If you leave for Haicheng now, the meeting might not go as planned.

77
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,260
 

78
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,120
What's going on with Second Child?

79
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,120
How could she leave us waiting like this at the end-of-year family meeting?

80
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,459
Does she still have any respect for us?

81
00:09:21,459 --> 00:09:25,040
Third Brother, maybe she got held up by something.

82
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,690
Let's wait a bit longer.

83
00:09:28,379 --> 00:09:33,839
Uncles, I'll be hosting the meeting today.

84
00:09:36,219 --> 00:09:38,979
Yingqi, your sister isn't here yet.

85
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:42,040
Let's wait for her first.

86
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:48,920
Today's meeting is about deciding who will be the next head of the family.

87
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:56,040
Fourth Uncle, I don't think she needs to be here for this.

88
00:09:58,479 --> 00:10:03,219
Besides, she left the city last night, so she definitely won't make it.

89
00:10:03,219 --> 00:10:08,180
Jiang Yingqi, even if your second sister can't come today,

90
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:11,440
it doesn't mean you get to take charge.

91
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,940
What, you think you can become the family head?

92
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:21,379
You, who only create problems instead of solving them, think you're fit for the role?

93
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,300
Third Granduncle, say something.

94
00:10:29,479 --> 00:10:34,710
Yingqi, whether your second sister shows up or not,

95
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:39,950
you will not be the head of this family.

96
00:10:42,179 --> 00:10:48,020
Third Granduncle, didn't you promise to support me?

97
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,979
Third Granduncle?

98
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,080
Didn't you...

99
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:08,260
Didn't you all agree to let me become the family head?

100
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,879
Why is everyone silent? Say something!

101
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:23,319
Do you really think you, with those petty tricks of yours, are up for the role?

102
00:11:23,319 --> 00:11:27,980
Second Sister, didn't you leave the city last night?

103
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,820
Let's get back to the previous subject.

104
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:44,340
Uncles, if you agree to make Jiang Yingqi the family head, please raise your hands.

105
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,439
See that, Jiang Yingqi?

106
00:11:55,439 --> 00:11:57,279
This is the result.

107
