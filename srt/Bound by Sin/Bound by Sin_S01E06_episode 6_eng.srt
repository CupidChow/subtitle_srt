1
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,260
   

2
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:14,780
   

3
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,480
You could have got off.

4
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,080
Why did you save me?

5
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,880
I'll save everyone.

6
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,900
No matter who they are.

7
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,000
Are you sure you won't consider being my bodyguard?

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,240
I can pay you three times more than the Xu family does.

9
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,120
Aren't you afraid

10
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,200
I have ulterior motives?

11
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,400
Don't trust others so easily.

12
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,440
Really?

13
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:06,160
Then, are you after my family's forture?

14
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:10,480
Or me?

15
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:20,980
team credits

16
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,880
Good night.

17
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,620
We shall talk about it tomorrow.

18
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,960
 Boss, it probably isn't him. 

19
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,720
 It seems Fu Cheng's age is real. 

20
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,160
 So he can't be the one. 

21
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,520
 Yes. Fu Cheng is older than him. 

22
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:26,200
 According to the investigation, many old neighbors watched him grow up. 

23
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,460
 His age should be real. 

24
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,080
 You're truly a gentleman. 

25
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,840
 I'd like to see how long you can hold back. 

26
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,040
Hello. Jiang's Trading Company.

27
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,960
 Hello, Miss Ke. It's Fu Cheng speaking. 

28
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,120
 Miss Jiang asked me to pass on a few words to you. 

29
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,915
 ã€Š

30
00:03:09,915 --> 00:03:11,120
   

31
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,080
I've read the newspaper. It's a local gang trying to blackmail the Jiang family

32
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,600
by inciting villagers to create chaos.

33
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,800
But there's no mention of your disappearance.

34
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,880
It's fine as long as the Jiang Family's reputation remains untarnished.

35
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,240
I'm nothing compared to Jiang's.

36
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:48,720
No matter when, life is supreme.

37
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,120
Any news from Ke Rui?

38
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,840
She's almost done with her investigation.

39
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,360
It's time for us to go back.

40
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,800
Mr. Fu, can you do me a favor and relay another message?

41
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,040
Tell Ke Rui that I have been found.

42
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,400
Yingxian.

43
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,600
Ke Rui told me you were missing.

44
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,720
I was so worried.

45
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,620
Thank you for coming all the way to Gangcheng.

46
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:06,080
Ke Rui, take Mr. Fu to the hospital to check his wounds.

47
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,720
All his medical expenses will be paid by the Jiang family.

48
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,560
Then, prepare a reward for him.

49
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,080
Don't bother.

50
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,200
I insist.

51
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,360
If you really don't want to, I won't force you.

52
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:25,080
But I hope Mr. Fu can come to work for me tomorrow as my personal bodyguard.

53
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,240
Thanks to you being by Yingxian's side.

54
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,800
Or things could have been much worse for her.

55
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,240
I'll prepare a gift as a token of gratitude, and send it to you another day.

56
00:05:49,078 --> 00:05:50,698
Let's go.

57
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:11,000
 Jiang Yingxian, what am I to you? 

58
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,440
- Father. 
 - Be careful.

59
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,960
- Sister. 
 - Uncle.

60
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,760
Come here.

61
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,280
Sit down.

62
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,920
What happened to you?

63
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,760
Does it hurt?

64
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,400
I'm fine. Just some minor injuries.

65
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,920
Call Doctor Du.

66
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,920
Call him to come to check on your second sister.

67
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,960
I've already called him this morning. He's on the way.

68
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,640
Good for you.

69
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:45,680
Father, I've got some clues about Second Sister's injury.

70
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,980
Forget it.

71
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:50,320
Your second sister just got back. Let's not bring it up yet.

72
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,800
I...

73
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,560
That's right. I've read the newspaper.

74
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,320
It's just some gangsters trying to blackmail us.

75
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:04,560
Since I'm fine, please let it go.

76
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:12,080
Dongyang, stay for dinner with us tonight.

77
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,720
Now that Yingxian's back safe and sound, I feel relieved.

78
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,040
I've got something to deal with in Haicheng. I need to head back there.

79
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,000
Fine. Work always comes first.

80
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,920
Dongyang.

81
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:29,000
You two have been engaged for almost a year now.

82
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,080
It's time for me to call Director Shen

83
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,220
to talk about your wedding.

84
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,480
I'll follow whatever you two decide.

85
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:55,800
Boss, you asked me to leak the information to Young Master Yingqi.

86
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,520
Isn't it because you want to expose Eldest Young Master?

87
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:03,440
I never expected Yingqi could do anything to Eldest Brother.

88
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,620
I just wanted to see how Father would react.

89
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,050
Now it's clear that Father already knew

90
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:17,200
Eldest Brother had something to do with the incident.

91
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,360
But he wants the whole thing dropped.

92
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,560
So I said let it go.

93
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,780
It's in line with what my father wants.

94
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,920
I didn't expect Old Master to protect Eldest Young Master this much.

95
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:32,480
It seems we'd better think of other ways.

96
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:36,240
Boss, we've found some new clues.

97
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,800
They should lead us to Jiang Yingsi soon.

98
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,380
Really?

99
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,500
I'm looking forward to it.

100
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,220
   

101
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,320
Mr. Fu.

102
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,520
I've submitted my resignation to the Xu family.

103
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,840
I'm here to report for duty.

104
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:15,700
From now on, I'll be counting on you for my safety.

105
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,920
Take your seat.

106
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:25,360
Is this the way you like to talk?

107
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,200
While being demure is your disguise in front of others,

108
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,500
is being unrestrained your disguise in front of me?

109
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,940
You think you've got me all figured out?

110
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:45,800
You think you can teach me how to behave just because you saved my life?

111
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,760
I pity you.

112
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,160
 This is the first time Jiang Yingxian has heard someone pity her. 

113
00:09:55,160 --> 00:10:02,520
 She's always lived in luxury, surrounded by deceit and power struggles, 

114
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:06,920
 constantly worrying about losing everything she has. 

115
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:12,200
 She's never experienced being cared for or tolerated. 

116
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,790
 Where does she,  

117
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:19,960
 Jiang Yingxian, deserve pity from someone who is nobody? 

118
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,080
Miss Jiang, you came out of it alive. You'll surely be blessed in the future.

119
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,680
You're making fun of me, Director Yu.

120
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,120
Fortunately, nothing serious happened in Jiangbei Village.

121
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,660
Or I would have to atone with my life.

122
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:52,360
Let's not speak such inauspicious words.

123
00:10:53,089 --> 00:10:55,080
I invited you here today

124
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,720
because I heard that there's a plan to rebuild the Xijiang Dock in Gangcheng.

125
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:04,100
I wonder if we have a chance to work with you again.

126
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,560
Yes, indeed.

127
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,880
There is such a plan.

128
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:18,630
If Miss Jiang is interested, we...

129
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,280
Waiter!

130
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,960
It's you again.

131
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,320
Director Yu, please don't mind.

132
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,620
My bodyguard became a nervous wreck after the Jiangbei Village incident.

133
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,120
Fu Cheng, wait for me outside.

134
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,320
It's safe here.

135
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,520
Have a seat.

136
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,520
 A'Cheng. 

137
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,120
 I know you've always been kind and upright. 

138
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,560
 But you should know from the military 

139
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,640
 that kindness and uprightness are not meant for enemies. 

140
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,920
 Uncle Fu. 

141
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:33,721
 All we know now is that twenty years ago, the Jiang family fished in troubled waters 

142
00:12:33,721 --> 00:12:36,000
 - by buying the Gu family at a low price... 
 - The extermination of the entire Gu family 

143
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,720
 is the biggest gain for the Jiang family. 

144
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,640
 Do you still think they are innocent? 

145
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,440
 Uncle Fu. 

146
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,200
 I know. 

147
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,880
 I'll try to get close to Jiang Yingxian. 

148
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:03,720
 The Jiangbei Village incident proves that the Jiang family is cruel. 

149
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:08,440
 Jiang Yingxian would even risk her life for the family's interests. 

150
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:13,280
 Is the misfortune of the Gu family really due to the Jiang family? 

151
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,280
 I have to figure it out. 

152
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,060
Wow! Look at my former watchdog.

153
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:27,680
Now what? You have the guts to come to Dance Hall after leaving me?

154
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,580
Can you afford it?

155
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,680
Fu.

156
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,560
You're really good-looking.

157
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:43,440
Had you just been with me, you wouldn't have to work so hard for my father.

158
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,640
We could have taken the money together, and spent it however we wanted...

159
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,120
You...

160
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,160
- I... 
 - Excuse me.

161
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,440
Miss Xu?

162
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,680
I just saw Mr. Xu outside.

163
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,040
- Is he here looking for you? 
 - I...

164
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,300
None of you have seen me.

165
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,160
I have nothing to do with Xu Yawei.

166
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,100
It was an accident.

167
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,960
It really was.

168
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,640
I know.

169
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,950
But Mr. Fu,

170
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:44,340
why are you explaining to me?

171
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,080
Mr. Fu, you had a sweet dream.

172
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,260
I can tell it from the smile on your face.

173
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:58,920
Thank you for bringing me back last night, and staying on guard all night.

174
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,880
Set off now for the Trading Company now?

175
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,920
Spare me one second to get washed.

176
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,320
Pure and innocent Mr. Fu.

177
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,760
It seems you had a wet dream.

178
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,080
What am I doing?

179
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,080
Shame on me!

180
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,240
Never forget the mission.

 â™« If we could turn the clock back â™«

 â™« In winter's chill, you said "I love you" right â™«

 â™« A thousand snowflakes softly land â™«

 â™« It recalls our first sweet meet â™«
