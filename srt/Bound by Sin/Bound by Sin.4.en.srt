00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:10,880
[Bound by Sin]

2
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:13,950
[Episode 4]

3
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:20,070
Mr. Shen.

4
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,390
It seems I have some urgent business to attend to,

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,550
so I won't see you off.

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,480
Isn't this Xu Yawei's bodyguard?

7
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:30,440
What's going on with you guys?

8
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:32,520
Something

9
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,110
that's not very nice to talk about.

10
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,960
About the Jiang family.

11
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:41,670
Jiang Yingxian.

12
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,430
I hope it is really about the Jiang family.

13
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:45,390
Otherwise, you don't want your father

14
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,600
to take back your power, do you?

15
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,560
I have things to do. See you later.

16
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:55,640
Call me anytime.

17
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,030
I will.

18
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,430
Come in with me.

19
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:30,590
Sit down.

20
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,950
If it's really him,

21
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,150
it'll be fun.

22
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:52,920
It's a beautiful day.

23
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,470
Do you like it?

24
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,680
I think this color goes well with you.

25
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:20,870
I chose it

26
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,840
especially for you.

27
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:24,800
You...

28
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:36,080
Actually, I've always been a bit curious

29
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,590
about what a decent

30
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,680
and tough guy like you

31
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,310
looks like when you

32
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,430
are pleasing women.

33
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,710
Shen Dongyang woke me up early in the morning,

34
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,360
so I'm sleepy now.

35
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,870
I'd like to get some sleep.

36
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,000
Mr. Fu.

37
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,590
Make yourself at home.

38
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,030
Jiang Yingxian!

39
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:24,910
What exactly

40
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,280
does she want?

41
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,560
Cheng.

42
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,030
This time,

43
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,870
we must fulfill all our vengeance

44
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:44,710
and take back

45
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:46,960
what we've lost.

46
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,710
I cuffed you,

47
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,030
so you really didn't move?

48
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,910
Two hours.

49
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,080
You have a lot of stamina.

50
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,400
Is this fun?

51
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:08,400
Yes,

52
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,520
it is.

53
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,000
Are you angry?

54
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,870
Don't give in too quickly.

55
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,360
Otherwise,

56
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,870
I'll lose the fun quickly.

57
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,950
What do you want?

58
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,510
What do I want?

59
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,240
The disenchantment of the prodigal

60
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,070
and the fall of a saint.

61
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:42,190
Isn't that what the world loves to see?

62
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:47,830
And I

63
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,800
love to see

64
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,270
the struggles of humanity,

65
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,160
especially that of somebody like you

66
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,750
who seems nobler than me.

67
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:09,600
Hold me.

68
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:18,830

You're not doing a very good job as a bodyguard.

119
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,320
If you just needed a bodyguard,

120
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:12,870
you wouldn't have to spend so much money.

121
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,150
But

122
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,600
a bodyguard

123
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:23,720
can't do this.

124
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,360
Turn off the light.

125
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:33,550
I need to sleep.

126

If he's really Jiang Yingsi,

127
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,840
will he fall in love with his half-sister?

128
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:05,240
Boss.

129
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:06,510
At Jiangbei Village,

130
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,200
we expect to open next month.

131
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,750
Got it.

132
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,630
Mr. Shen

133
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,960
was really helpful this time.

134
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,320
Indeed.

135
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,720
As long as you're willing to help in this matter,

136
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,000
I'll give you 10% of the profit

137
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,630
from your shipment through Jiang's Dock.

138
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,030
Yingxian.

139
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,630
Based on our relationship,

140
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,840
even without this 10%,

141
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,840
I will definitely help you.

142
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,240
Even if you borrow Master Shen's connections,

143
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,910
you still need to pay someone to handle it,

144
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,390
so no matter how,

145
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,240
I can't let you lose out on that, right?

146
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,200
Besides,

147
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,750
how can friendship be stronger

148
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,750
than a relationship of interest?

149
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,510
I'm sure I'll make a solid profit

150
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,510
doing business with you.

151
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,960
As long as you're willing to help.

152
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,000
Okay.

153
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,720
I'll give you an answer in a few days.

154
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:03,960
Stop.

155
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,150
Stop what?

156
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,000
I just want you to have fun.

157
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:09,910
Are you happy?

158
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,750
I won't spoil your fun.

159
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:14,910
I'll wait for your message.

160
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,600
She hung up.

161
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,510
Jiang Yingxian is jealous?

162
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:34,840
How can that be?

163
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:40,360
Dongyang.

164
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:48,600
Come on.

165
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:49,960
Put it on.

166
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,000
I'll stay here tonight.

167
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,600
I used to think you always gave me new clothes

168
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,000
because you liked me,

169
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,440
but I didn't realize

170
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,120
you just wanted me to dress up like her

171
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,270
to please you.

172
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:17,670
You jerk.

173
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,510
Uninhibited.

174
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:32,910
Shen Dongyang!

175
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:39,750
By the way,

176
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,120
keep an eye on what Jiang Yingqi

177
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:43,600
is doing these days.

178
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:46,320
He's been weirdly quiet these days.

179
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,630
Mr. Yingqi seems to be

180
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,270
at the Dance Hall all the time lately.

181
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,790
He may be up to some tricks again.

182
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,670
Any news from the North?

183
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,750
It's been too long,

184
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,120
so there's no clue.

185
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,960
Then keep investigating Fu Cheng.

186
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,200
Boss, don't forget

187
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,240
how your brother

188
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,670
ended up in this position.

189
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,480
He's the eldest son,

190
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,960
educated enough, competent,

191
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,360
ten years older than you,

192
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:21,120
and a worthy successor,

193
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,790
but he made such a mistake with his marriage

194
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:24,870
that he insisted on marrying

195
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,480
a female performer with a bad reputation.

196
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,030
Master was so angry he didn't even show up on the wedding day.

197
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,000
I know.

198
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,270
It's because of my brother's falling out with my father

199
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:37,240
and his gradual marginalization in the business world

200
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,240
that I've been given this opportunity.

201
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:41,960
Don't worry.

202
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,440
I'm not a playgirl.

203
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:48,150
Some things can only be a pastime.

204
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,120
The people who have been investigating you in your hometown

205
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:58,630
may be from the Jiang family.

206
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,390
The Jiang family's second daughter

207
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,510
is still young,

208
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:02,870
but she's a tough one.

209
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:06,150
She has recently snatched the project in Jiangbei Village

210
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:07,720
that the Jiang family's oldest son was in charge of.

211
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:10,480
Now she takes care of most

212
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,670
of the important business of the Jiang family.

213
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:18,630
She

214
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,910
is a strange person.

215
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,790
She is not only thoughtful

216
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,790
but also so unpredictable

217
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,270
that it's hard

218
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,030
for people to figure out what she's up to.

219
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:33,120
We should be careful

220
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,120
with this woman,

221
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:36,670
but if we succeed,

222
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,480
the whole Jiang family will be in our hands.

223
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,200
But I always felt

224
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,600
that she was testing me

225
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,360
rather than being interested in me.

226
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,000
I don't know

227
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,600
which one of us is the prey in the end.

228
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,910
My brother is disobedient

229
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,870
and married to a woman from a family that doesn't match ours,

230
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:11,750
so my father definitely can't let him run the Jiang family.

231
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,480
My sister

232
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,440
is very capable,

233
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,390
but

234
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,080
she is a girl after all.

235
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,000
If the Jiang family is under her control,

236
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,510
the whole family will have another family name,

237
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:25,910
so

238
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,390
the Jiang family will be mine.

239
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,750
Director Yu.

240
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,360
Tomorrow we're going to start construction at Jiangbei Village.

241
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,720
Please come with me to the ribbon cutting.

242
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,440
You're always reliable.

243
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,240
If Shen Dongyang hadn't gotten there first,

244
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,150
I would have asked Master Jiang

245
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,790
for permission to marry you.

246
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,670
You're flattering me.

247
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,840
Come on. Drink more.

248
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,320
Director Yu, let's make a deal.

249
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,360
I'll see you tomorrow.

250
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,120
See you tomorrow.

251
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,270
Come on.

252
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:18,960
Mr. Jiang.

253
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,150
Yingxian?

254
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:25,670
Why are you here?

255
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:27,120
Miss Xu.

256
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:29,150
I'm sorry. I'm drunk.

257
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:31,080
Can I borrow a driver from you?

258
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,720
It's rare for Miss Jiang

259
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,240
to turn to uneducated people like us.

260
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,510
See my bodyguard?

261
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,080
Handsome, isn't he?

262
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,360
Give me a thousand.

263
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,510
You can have him.

264
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,030
[Check. Jiang Yingxian]

265
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:52,750
