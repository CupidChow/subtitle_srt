1
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:31,640
 ♫ Drifting aimlessly Not knowing where to go ♫ 

2
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:37,300
 ♫ The moonlight tonight feels sorrowful ♫ 

3
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:42,740
 ♫ I stand alone against it ♫ 

4
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,941
 ♫ But I don't want to ♫ 

5
00:00:44,941 --> 00:00:51,740
 ♫ The longing catches me off guard ♫ 

6
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:59,980
 ♫ To the silent night, I surrender myself ♫ 

7
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:11,740
 ♫ Tossing and turning, lost in confusion In the darkness, I lose my way ♫ 

8
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:22,010
Team name

9
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,030
 

10
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,040
The world is full of danger,
and the human mind is unpredictable.

11
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:41,490
I just need some precautions.

12
00:01:43,963 --> 00:01:45,760
I'm a man.

13
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,120
Even if these photos leak,

14
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,560
it won't affect me at all.
 

15
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,680
Everyone has secrets that others don't know about.

16
00:01:53,680 --> 00:02:00,280
And my secret is that I love
watching virtuous ascetics lose control.

17
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,820
 

18
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,440
Mr. Shen, you can't go in.

19
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,870
The boss isn't available
to meet other guests right now.

20
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,670
Why, in such an embarrassing situation,
would you still...

21
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,220
Stop talking.

22
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:22,990
Not available?
I didn't know she had guests today.

23
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,340
Mr. Shen.

24
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:29,160
What do you think of my lips?

25
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,280
Or do you prefer my legs?

26
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,010
Why won't you let me in?

27
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:41,520
Is your boss doing something shady in the room?

28
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,070
Mr. Shen.

29
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,970
Is that enough?

30
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,300
- Pleasure working with you.
- Mr. Shen.

31
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,232
 

32
00:02:58,232 --> 00:02:59,441
 

33
00:02:59,441 --> 00:03:04,220
 

34
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:08,220
 

35
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:12,920
 

36
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,670
Miss Jiang, look this way.

37
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,560
Miss Jiang, over here.

38
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,430
Mr. Shen is going too far,

39
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:24,780
giving your engagement necklace to a random woman.

40
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:28,440
Is it really okay for me to wear
your fiancée's necklace?

41
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,100
Do whatever you want.

42
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,280
Mr. Shen is here.

43
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,496
- Mr. Shen has arrived.
- Mr. Shen is here.

44
00:03:32,496 --> 00:03:34,736
- Mr. Shen.
- Mr. Shen.

45
00:03:34,736 --> 00:03:36,680
Mr. Shen, look this way.

46
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,180
Shen Dong Yang and I are only engaged
for business reasons.

47
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,720
We have no feelings for each other,

48
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,220
so I don't expect him to remain loyal to me.

49
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:46,040
But he's being so blatant about it.

50
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,820
What can I say?
To gain more power, I need him around.

51
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:52,430
Are you sure Master Jiang will let you be the head of the family

52
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:54,680
after you marry Mr. Shen?

53
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,160
Look over here, Mr. Shen.

54
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,060
Well, I have to take a leap of faith.

55
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:02,520
By the way,
I left a document at the branch office.

56
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,520
Retrieve it for me.

57
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,650
Happy to help.

58
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,220
I've heard Miss Jiang really knows
how to pull the strings,

59
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,050
and now half of the Jiang family's business
is under her control.

60
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:19,800
None of her brothers can compare to her.

61
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,040
But I've also heard the Jiang family

62
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,020
is still looking for the illegitimate son
they lost touch with.

63
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:27,270
So, who will eventually become head
of the Jiang family is still unclear.

64
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,980
Mr. Shen, Miss Jiang, look this way.

65
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,040
Miss Jiang and Mr. Shen,
you are such a perfect match.

66
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,554
- Is your wedding happening next year?
- Yes, it seems so.

67
00:04:38,554 --> 00:04:41,154
A grand event is coming soon.

68
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,920
Covering the first floor.

69
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,032
Covering the second floor.
 

70
00:04:47,032 --> 00:04:49,400
- Covering the third floor.
- Alright, return to your positions.

71
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,190
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

72
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,660
Ugh, she's so full of herself.

73
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,620
So she's got a fiancé. Big deal.

74
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,910
Without Shen Dong Yang,

75
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:05,200
she'd just be a useless rich girl who goes to the Orchid Club every night,

76
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,730
looking for random men to have fun with!

77
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,890
Miss Xu, please watch your words.

78
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:32,800
Since when is it your place to tell me what to do?

79
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:42,440
Let me guess. You want to go
please Jiang Ying Xian too, don't you?

80
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,430
Get out of the way.

81
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:53,760
Miss Xu.

82
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,840
Stop following me.

83
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,330
Miss Xu.

84
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:58,560
Stop following me!

85
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,920
Miss Xu, don't go smoking opium again.

86
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,950
Are you a dog?

87
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,410
You follow me wherever I go.

88
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,670
I need to pee now. Are you going to follow me too?

89
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,410
Fine, go in and watch me pee!

90
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,380
Let's go.

91
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,040
Let go of me!

92
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,600
- Let go!
- Shen Dong Yang.

93
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,210
You abandoned my sister.
I won't let you get away with this!

94
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,330
Take him away!

95
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,600
Who are you here to guard, exactly?

96
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,500
I didn't see you protecting me just now!

97
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:27,320
Miss Xu, let's head back.

98
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,110
Let go of me!

99
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,300
Isn't that Xu Ya Wei,
the second daughter of Gangcheng's Xu family?

100
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,240
I almost didn't recognize her.

101
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,660
Who's the other guy?

102
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,370
I think he's her new bodyguard.

103
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,480
A bodyguard? Doesn't seem like it.

104
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,600
A bodyguard looks like that?

105
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,480
I heard he's an ex-military man from the north.

106
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,280
Someone tempted Xu Ya Wei into using opium.

107
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,960
After Xu Zheng Hai found out,

108
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,560
he hired an ex-soldier as a bodyguard
to keep an eye on her.

109
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,200
Like her, Ying Xian is also a rich young lady,

110
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:06,350
but she never goes astray.

111
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,040
What do you think people like us should do

112
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:20,320
if something we're interested in
just so happens to belong to someone else?

113
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,360
So what if it belongs to someone else?

114
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,000
Just buy it.

115
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,080
Even if the owner refuses to sell,

116
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,730
it's not impossible to take it by force.

117
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:31,940
You're right.

118
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:35,170
It's not impossible to take it by force.

119
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:40,880
Tell me.
What's caught your eye this time?

120
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,960
I'll help you get it.

121
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:46,800
For something like this,
it's better to handle it myself.

122
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,570
Thanks to Miss Xu,

123
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,800
this year's banquet is more interesting than usual.

124
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,720
You're just a bodyguard my father hired, a lackey.

125
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,950
What are you doing?
I just want to have some fun.

126
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,760
What are you doing?

127
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,070
Miss Xu, don't have fun
by touching things you shouldn't.

128
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:29,740
Miss, you've stepped on the lighter.

129
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,470
Have I?

130
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:36,470
Well, after you pick it up,
could you light my cigar for me?

131
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:09,050
What, is it your first time lighting a cigar?

132
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:13,250
It's my first time seeing a woman smoke a cigar.

133
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:11,460
Has anyone ever told you
that your back is like a ruler?

134
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,580
It even stays perfectly straight
when you bend down.

135
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,030
No.

136
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,950
Thank you for protecting me earlier.

137
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:24,580
 Little does Fu Cheng know that the next time
he sees this cigar-smoking woman, 

138
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:28,290
 it will be in an even more awkward situation. 

139
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,430
Boss, your brother's in trouble!

140
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,900
- Where is he now? 
 - In your hotel room.

141
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,430
 

142
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,780
Ying Xian.

143
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,380
Help me, please.
 

144
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,820
If Dad finds out, I'm finished.
 

145
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:00,380
Get up. What happened?

146
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,800
It's all because of Lu Xuan.

147
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,025
Jiang Ying Qi,
 

148
00:12:03,025 --> 00:12:05,860
you've got a nice new car.
 

149
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:09,200
If you like it, Mr. Lu, you can have it.

150
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,960
Jiang Ying Qi, have you lost your mind?

151
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,170
Why would you try to please the illegitimate son
of a mere deputy commander?

152
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:15,340
Lu Xuan got into a car accident.

153
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:18,910
The car was yours.

154
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:23,740
If it were that simple,
you wouldn't be this scared.

155
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,890
What really happened?

156
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:32,500
That night, Lu Xuan left a private party
with a girl.

157
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:36,390
They were both drunk,
and they got into an argument.

158
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,930
Then...

159
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,630
- Ying Xian... Ying Xian, I'm so sorry!
- And a journalist took pictures too?

160
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:06,070
If we weren't family,
I'd really shoot you right now, you idiot!

161
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,180
Ke Rui, call the Shen family.

162
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,660
Got it.

163
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:21,660
How's the girl now?
 

164
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,060
She's severely injured and still in surgery.

165
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,290
Boss, to be honest,

166
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:29,660
any other Jiang family member wouldn't bother saving her.

167
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:32,740
Once she wakes up, there will be a lot of trouble.

168
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:35,940
She's been to one of Lu Xuan's private gatherings.

169
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:41,350
So, even you've been infected
with my family's cold-heartedness, huh?

170
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,550
How is Lu Xuan now?

171
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:47,740
He broke a rib and had surgery last night.

172
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:50,600
With another two weeks of rest,
he'll be discharged.

173
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,860
How's the Lu family reacting?

174
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,420
They know they're in the wrong.

175
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:56,740
Mr. Shen helped suppress the news,
and kept it from going public.

176
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:59,020
Our only worry now is the girl and her family.

177
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,880
As long as they stay quiet...

178
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,840
Have you found her details?

179
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,580
It took some effort, but I got them.

180
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,040
Her name is Fu Zhi.

181
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,740
Her mother passed away young,
and her father's been missing for years.

182
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,940
She has an older brother named Fu Cheng.

183
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:14,340
He enlisted at 18,
and made it to the top class in just one year.

184
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,710
He's participated in many special operations.

185
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,510
It's him.

186
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:09,360
Why didn't he choose to stay in the military,
and climb the ranks?

187
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,360
Why leave the army to become a bodyguard?

188
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:27,990
team credits

 ♫ You've set off ♫   ♫ To warm another world ♫ 

190
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:48,140
 ♫ I've stopped ♫   ♫ But never said goodbye to the past ♫ 

191
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,600
 ♫ Watching you leave,
I mourn, and sorrow lingers ♫ 

192
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,180
 ♫ Tears of regret, pain running deep ♫ 

193
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:57,174
 ♫ You've gone to a world that isn't yours ♫ 

194
00:15:57,174 --> 00:16:02,300
 ♫ Here's a song for the passersby of life ♫ 

195
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:07,320
 ♫ When you listen, will you tear up? ♫ 

196
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:16,630
 ♫ The past has been cremated ♫   ♫ Placed in the urn of my heart ♫ 

197
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:23,140
 ♫ Crying, I say ♫   ♫ I'm not afraid anymore,
I've forgotten the hurt ♫ 

198
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:28,180
 ♫ You, singing a song ♫   ♫ Stand barefoot in the river of my life ♫ 

199
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:36,540
 ♫ The past has been cremated ♫   ♫ No longer relying on anyone to live ♫ 

200
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:03,780
 ♫ You understand now, right? ♫   ♫ I think you do ♫ 

201
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:08,980
 ♫ The novelty of it all ♫   ♫ Only becomes scary once it fades ♫ 

202
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:11,500
 ♫ Turns out, even deities have cried ♫ 

203
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,060
 ♫ Pitying us and our foolish lives ♫ 

204
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:18,060
 ♫ I respect the final choice you made ♫ 

205
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:23,200
 ♫ Here's a song for the passersby of life ♫ 

206
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:28,080
 ♫ When you listen, will you tear up? ♫ 

207
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:37,556
 ♫ The past has been cremated ♫   ♫ Placed in the urn of my heart ♫ 

208
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:44,020
 ♫ Crying, I say ♫   ♫ I'm not afraid anymore,
I've forgotten the hurt ♫ 

209
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:49,340
 ♫ You, singing a song ♫   ♫ Stand barefoot in the river of my life ♫
