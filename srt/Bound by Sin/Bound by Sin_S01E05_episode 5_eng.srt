1
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:11,260
   

2
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:15,000
   

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,439
It's all arranged.

4
00:00:16,439 --> 00:00:19,279
Eldest Young Master, don't worry. It's all prepared.

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,720
Let's go.

6
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,200
I hope Second Sister will have a good day tomorrow.

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,400
 

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:35,880


9
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,240
Miss Jiang, we've arrived.

10
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:44,220
Aren't you going to ask me why we came to such a remote place at night?

11
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:14,719
Does it make you happy to play with men?

12
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:19,410
You've had one man after another around you,

13
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:21,990
so until when do you want to play?

14
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:25,660
Until I've had enough.

15
00:01:26,539 --> 00:01:28,079
Don't move.

16
00:01:44,999 --> 00:01:46,639
Let go of me.

17
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,179
Are you ordering me?

18
00:01:51,179 --> 00:01:53,240
I said let go of me.

19
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,200
What if I don't?

20
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,560
What can you do to me?

21
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:06,680
It's never been my tie that's held you down,

22
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,630
but your own morals and principles,

23
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:12,480
so you'll never escape.

24
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,320
You know what?

25
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:27,380
It's my favorite thing to see when you can barely stand it.

26
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:33,700
I wish you could be honest about your own desires sooner.

27
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,679
 It's so ironic. 

28
00:02:36,679 --> 00:02:42,539
 My restraint and patience are the very source of her pleasure. 

29
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:45,440
 Then why should I endure it? 

30
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:43,340
Satisfied?

31
00:03:49,399 --> 00:03:51,459
Sit tight.

32
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:53,160
I'll take you back.

33
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,960
No need.

34
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,189
Take me to Jiangbei Village.

35
00:03:57,189 --> 00:03:59,949
I have to go to the ribbon cutting ceremony early tomorrow morning.

36
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:15,080
By the way, although I've been with one man after another,

37
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:19,400
I'm only like this with you.

38
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,219
   

39
00:04:28,219 --> 00:04:32,059
- Compensate! 
 - Compensate!

40
00:04:32,059 --> 00:04:35,410
- Compensate! 
 - Compensate!

41
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:39,069
- Compensate! 
 - Compensate!

42
00:04:39,069 --> 00:04:43,130
- Compensate! 
 - Compensate!

43
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:47,600
- Compensate! 
 - Compensate!

44
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,060
What's going on?

45
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,679
Boss, I just got here too.

46
00:04:50,679 --> 00:04:52,960
These villagers claimed that we didn't give compensation,

47
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,559
prevented us from starting construction, and even injured our workers.

48
00:04:56,559 --> 00:04:58,820
Didn't the villagers move out half a month ago?

49
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,679
Why did so many villagers suddenly appear?

50
00:05:00,679 --> 00:05:03,920
I don't know what the situation is now.

51
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,239
Now take him to get patched up, and ask a few people to surround the place.

52
00:05:07,239 --> 00:05:08,759
Don't let the reporters take pictures.

53
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:10,960
Ask another person to go to the police station now.

54
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,559
Yes.

55
00:05:13,679 --> 00:05:17,439
No matter what happens, don't let it damage the Jiang family's reputation.

56
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,820
Find out who's behind this as soon as possible.

57
00:05:24,799 --> 00:05:28,160
Given the situation, it would be dangerous for you to go.

58
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,199
If I don't step in, how will the person behind the trick continue to make moves?

59
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:36,080
- Compensate! 
 - Compensate!

60
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,640
Villagers, I'm Jiang Yingxian, the head of Jiang's.

61
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,680
If you have any demands, we can talk in detail.

62
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,600
- Don't talk nonsense! 
 - That's right. No nonsense!

63
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,080
Compensate now!

64
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,339
What are you doing?

65
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,979
Don't harm them, or we'll be at fault even if we're not.

66
00:05:57,979 --> 00:06:00,459
Trust me. Leave it to me.

67
00:06:00,459 --> 00:06:04,199
There are things you can't do but a bodyguard can.

68
00:06:05,219 --> 00:06:06,960
They're shooting!

69
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,479
Don't let them get away!

70
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:14,080
- Go after them! 
 - Compensate! Stop right there!

71
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,799
They came prepared, and tried to surround you from the start.

72
00:06:19,799 --> 00:06:21,400
I knew it.

73
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,740
You knew? Then why did you go over there?

74
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:30,480
What? Are you angry?

75
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,920
Where are we going? This is not the way back to the city.

76
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,559
Kun Mountain.

77
00:06:39,239 --> 00:06:41,820
Why Kun Mountain?

78
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,799
Do you trust me?

79
00:06:43,799 --> 00:06:47,160
- Is something wrong with the car? 
 - Wrap all the clothes in the car around you.

80
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,140
Hold on to me later.

81
00:06:57,895 --> 00:07:00,106
Don't worry. You'll be fine.

82
00:07:00,106 --> 00:07:04,659
I've jumped out of cars many times in the army.

83
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:07,219
Close your eyes.

84
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:11,140
Get ready. Three. Two. One!

85
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,119
I told you you'd be okay.

86
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,700
Come on.

87
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,040
Your injuries need to be handled as soon as possible.

88
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,640
I'm fine.

89
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,480
We can't go back yet.

90
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,400
Find a place to hide for a few days.

91
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,779
Do you know who's setting you up?

92
00:08:18,559 --> 00:08:24,160
Nine times out of ten, it's my eldest brother, but I don't have any hard evidence right now.

93
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,199
I have to wait for Ke Rui to investigate.

94
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,280
Won't it be faster if we just call the police?

95
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,400
No. If it's really my brother,

96
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,959
internal family conflicts can only be resolved at home.

97
00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:39,199
Once it's exposed, it's damaging to the whole Jiang's.

98
00:08:39,199 --> 00:08:42,479
No one would like a partner with constant internal strife.

99
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,319
Is the reputation of Jiang's more important than your life?

100
00:08:45,319 --> 00:08:50,120
Of course not, but when my life is not in danger,

101
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,300
Jiang's is my life.

102
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:58,000
Come on. I'll carry you.

103
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,439
There's a village up ahead,

104
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:03,240
but at the rate we're going, we won't get there even by nightfall.

105
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,699
Come on.

106
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,880
It was a very chaotic scene.

107
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,079
I saw Boss... No...

108
00:09:21,079 --> 00:09:22,839
Miss Jiang getting into the car. 
    

109
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:24,959
And then I don't know where she went.

110
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,640
After that, there was no news of her, so I rushed to hire someone to look for her,

111
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,839
but in the end, we only found her car.

112
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:35,079
Something was wrong with the car.

113
00:09:37,479 --> 00:09:40,899
Uncle, I heard something happened to Yingxian.

114
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:56,240
So now, you only found Yingxian's car, and nothing else, right?

115
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:03,679
Uncle, I got an overview on the way here.

116
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:05,880
It's not too bad now.

117
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,070
Maybe Yingxian was just injured and tried to get help,

118
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:10,439
so she got lost in the neighborhood.

119
00:10:10,439 --> 00:10:14,520
We've asked all the workers at Jiang's to look for her.

120
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,020
You didn't ask the police to help?

121
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:22,699
Before her accident, she specifically told me that no matter what happened,

122
00:10:22,699 --> 00:10:28,039
I couldn't publicize this so as not to affect Jiang's reputation.

123
00:10:29,319 --> 00:10:31,659
Stupid girl.

124
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:36,470
You're also stupid enough to do what she said

125
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,799
regardless of the time or situation.

126
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:40,719
I apologize for being stupid.

127
00:10:40,719 --> 00:10:42,799
Miss Jiang probably didn't realize

128
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:47,380
someone was tampering with her car when she instructed me.

129
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,920
Did you learn anything other than to apologize when you studied in Japan?

130
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,120
You're useless.

131
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,639
Now go to the police.

132
00:11:00,579 --> 00:11:04,460
Uncle, my father is friends with Director He of the police station.

133
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:07,880
Let me go with Ke Rui and explain to him.

134
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,620
Thank you.

135
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:16,419
Eldest Son, follow me upstairs.

136
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:30,539
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

137
00:11:31,319 --> 00:11:34,199
Tell me. Where is Yingxian now?

138
00:11:34,199 --> 00:11:35,839
Boss is really missing,

139
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,559
or I wouldn't have taken the liberty of asking you to play along in front of Old Master

140
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:42,719
to get his approval for us to go looking for her openly.

141
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,760
Did something really happen to Yingxian?

142
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,960
If I hadn't invited you here tonight,

143
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:51,200
I'm afraid Old Master would have thought the same as you.

144
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,020
Put me down.

145
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,360
- My leg doesn't hurt anymore. 
 - Don't worry.

146
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,340
When we enter the village, we'll go to a certain house

147
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:18,620
and say that we're siblings who went up the mountain, but were accidentally injured.

148
00:12:19,699 --> 00:12:22,240
Do we look like siblings?

149
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,759
I think we're like a couple on the run.

150
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,980
Say whatever you like.

151
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,859
You...

152
00:13:00,659 --> 00:13:04,199
You have suffered greatly. Your wound...

153
00:13:04,199 --> 00:13:07,350
So we decided to elope,

154
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:10,779
but on the way, we were still caught up by my dad,

155
00:13:10,779 --> 00:13:13,140
so we jumped out of the car.

156
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,799
Girl, stay here in peace.

157
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:18,880
Get well from your injuries before you go.

158
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,539
Thank you so much, ma'am.

159
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:30,719
These aren't anything valuable, but they can still be exchanged for some money.

160
00:13:30,719 --> 00:13:32,300
I can't take it.

161
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:37,000
Besides food, we'd like you to bring us some medicine.

162
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:44,080
By the way, you'll have to sell them after we leave,

163
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:48,120
or I'm afraid my father will find us.

164
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,839
Okay. Don't worry.

165
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,240
I won't divulge any information about you guys.

166
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,280
I'll go get you some medicine.

167
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,179
Thank you, ma'am.

168
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,240
What a nice girl.

169
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,660
Don't let her down.

170
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,240
It'll hurt a little.

171
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,360
- I can bear it. 
 - You don't have to.

172
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,640
You can cry and scream whenever you want to.

173
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:44,420
You'll never be the most miserable screamer I've heard.

174
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,819
I'm going to do it now.

175
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,740
That's it.

176
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,599
Let me put on medicine for you too.

177
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:31,920
What? Even now, you're still afraid I'll take liberties?

178
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:10,260
Come on.

179
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:19,280
It's my job.

180
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:23,640
They just look scary, but they're not that serious.

181
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,199
Come on.

182
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,000
I'm going to apply the alcohol now.

183
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:19,020
team credits

184
00:17:30,415 --> 00:17:36,340
 ♫ I often think of the last time we met ♫ 

185
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:42,740
 ♫ You stood before me with a real smile ♫ 

186
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:47,040
 ♫ I was a little restless ♫ 

187
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:51,280
 ♫ But I finally said goodbye ♫ 

188
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:57,420
 ♫ You turned and walked away into the winter ♫ 

189
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,820
 ♫ Life is short, and the world is big ♫ 

190
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:05,860
 ♫ We'll say goodbye at any moment ♫ 

191
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,620
 ♫ And the words we didn't finish ♫ 

192
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:12,680
 ♫ Become knots in time ♫ 

193
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:17,120
 ♫ I asked the wind when you'd be back ♫ 

194
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,320
 ♫ The wind was silent ♫ 

195
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,360
 ♫ We met but we couldn't stand by each other ♫ 

196
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,260
 ♫ Love is not our destiny ♫ 

197
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:31,760
 ♫ I asked the wind when you'd be back ♫ 

198
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,980
 ♫ You are silent ♫ 

199
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:38,600
 ♫ Even after all these years,
we can't see each other ♫ 

200
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:47,620
 ♫ I can only dazedly see you in the crowd ♫ 

201
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:01,760
 ♫ Life is short, and the world is big ♫ 

202
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,860
 ♫ We'll say goodbye at any moment ♫ 

203
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,640
 ♫ And the words we didn't finish ♫ 

204
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:12,680
 ♫ Become knots in time ♫ 

205
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:17,160
 ♫ I asked the wind when you'd be back ♫ 

206
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,380
 ♫ The wind was silent ♫ 

207
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:24,400
 ♫ We met but we couldn't stand by each other ♫ 

208
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,300
 ♫ Love is not our destiny ♫ 

209
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:31,700
 ♫ I asked the wind when you'd be back ♫ 

210
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,980
 ♫ You are silent ♫ 

211
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:38,660
 ♫ Even after all these years,
we can't see each other ♫ 

212
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:41,200
 ♫ I can only dazedly see you in the crowd ♫
