2
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,680
♫  Wandering aimlessly with no destination in mind  ♫

3
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:37,440
♫  Tonight's moonlight feels desolate  ♫

4
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:42,680
♫  Alone, I try to block it out  ♫

5
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,880
♫  But unexpectedly  ♫

6
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:51,380
♫  The longing is unavoidable  ♫

7
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:59,480
♫  The silent night compels me to surrender  ♫

8
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:10,580
♫  Wandering in the darkness, I lose my way  ♫

9
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:33,380
   

10
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36,879
   

11
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:39,080
Haicheng is temporarily under control,

12
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,530
but the Nan Army might attack again at any time.

13
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:49,840
We can't take the road from Haicheng to Gangcheng anymore.

14
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,400
I'll arrange for you and Ke Rui to go to Pingcheng tomorrow.

15
00:01:56,168 --> 00:01:59,999
Contact someone from the Jiang family to pick you two up at Pingcheng.

16
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,660
Get off.

17
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,959
Fu Cheng, I have something to tell you.

18
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,239
Say it.

19
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:55,380
Come with me tomorrow.

20
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,859
I need you.

21
00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:08,100
Fu Cheng, I need you.

22
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:11,040
♫  That are stuck in your throat  ♫

23
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,720
Jiang Yingxian,

24
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:19,859
if you are not serious, stop playing with my feelings.

25
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:25,760
I have no time to play such pointless games with you.

26
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,959
I am serious. Very serious.

27
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:30,079
I can't be any more serious.

28
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:34,079
Fu Cheng, stay by my side, all right?

29
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,820
You're serious?

30
00:03:39,679 --> 00:03:41,939
Do you even have a heart?

31
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:48,740
♫  You cannot discern lies from the truth  ♫

32
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,140
♫  All right  ♫

33
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:56,519
♫  From another perspective, love makes us pathetic  ♫

34
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:58,730
 Before I met him again, 

35
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:03,239
 I had never imagined that I'd say something like this. 

36
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:05,280
 If I leave someone, I mean it. 

37
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,639
 I'm not someone who regrets my actions. 

38
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:12,919
 However, we met again. 

39
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,460
Are you angry?

40
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:21,280
♫  The more I care, the greater the pain  ♫

41
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,559
I thought about it the whole night yesterday.

42
00:04:23,559 --> 00:04:28,119
How many obstacles will we face if we are together?

43
00:04:28,119 --> 00:04:29,920
Shen Dongyang.

44
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,439
My eldest brother.

45
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:33,559
My father.

46
00:04:33,559 --> 00:04:35,820
All the old men in the Jiang family.

47
00:04:36,799 --> 00:04:40,400
The names of different people kept appearing in my mind.

48
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,799
All of them were telling me to forget it.

49
00:04:44,799 --> 00:04:47,860
It's not worth it for a man.

50
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,220
♫  All right  ♫

51
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:52,780
♫  I'm the invisible paramour   ♫

52
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:55,840
♫  I'm pitiful  ♫

53
00:04:57,559 --> 00:04:59,679
I'm not good enough.

54
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,199
That's not the case.

55
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:05,720
It's me.

56
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:09,040
Every time I feel like giving up,

57
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,550
I can't help but think

58
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:15,720
what would have happened if you hadn't avoided the bullet yesterday,

59
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:22,559
if there was no longer anything between us, and if Fu Cheng no longer existed in this world.

60
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,860
I thought about many possible situations.

61
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:31,520
A moment ago, I finally understood why I thought about all these situations.

62
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,919
I don't want to lose you.

63
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:00,180
Yingxian,

64
00:06:02,444 --> 00:06:04,383
I can't go with you.

65
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,559
I am just an ordinary person.

66
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:16,370
I will also get angry and jealous

67
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,750
when I see you with another man.

68
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:23,500
I want to possess you, kiss you, and hug you.

69
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:28,259
I want to tell everyone that you are mine.

70
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:31,319
You only belong to me.

71
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:33,960
Even if I go back with you today,

72
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:40,679
I probably wouldn't be able to stand seeing you with someone else.

73
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,770
Yingxian,

74
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:57,640
if that were to happen, I don't know what I might do.

75
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:06,559
Fu Cheng,

76
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:10,300
I might not understand men, but you don't understand me either.

77
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,679
I told you I needed you, so I won't make you jealous.

78
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:19,579
I've never thought about making you my secret lover again.

79
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,600
Give me some time, all right?

80
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,359
I know you still don't believe me right now.

81
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,310
I just hope you can give me some time

82
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:12,790
to deal with matters with the Jiang family.

83
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:20,080
You should depart early.

84
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,280
The journey will be dangerous when it's dark.

85
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,760
Boss, have you thought this through?

86
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,240
I've always been a gambler.

87
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,920
It's just that no one has noticed that.

88
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,319
Yingxian, it's a relief to see you back safely.

89
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:27,670
Do you know how worried I was when Haicheng fell to the attack,

90
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:29,830
and you couldn't be contacted?

91
00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:34,210
Sorry for making you worry. I'm fine.

92
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:39,559
Sister, I heard Ke Rui got hurt.

93
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:40,959
Is she fine?

94
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,579
She got shot in her calf, but she was treated properly.

95
00:09:44,579 --> 00:09:46,350
I was worried that her wound would reopen after the journey,

96
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:48,910
so I sent her to the hospital first.

97
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,380
Where's Father? Why haven't I seen him?

98
00:09:59,079 --> 00:10:01,900
Father... Father is ill.

99
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,459
He has been in a coma for two days.

100
00:10:03,459 --> 00:10:05,099
He's in a coma?

101
00:10:05,099 --> 00:10:06,339
Why is he suddenly in a coma?

102
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:10,199
He... He tripped and fell suddenly.

103
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,799
Dongyang, you just came back from work.

104
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:19,439
You should go and rest.

105
00:10:19,439 --> 00:10:22,960
I'm going with Yingqi to the hospital later to check on Father.

106
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,760
I'll go with you.

107
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:31,379
No need. I'll contact you if I need anything.

108
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:37,080
Remember. You must contact me if you need anything.

109
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,299
Jiang Yingqi, come upstairs with me!

110
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,479
- Sister. 
 - Enough.

111
00:11:07,479 --> 00:11:09,240
Just tell me what you did.

112
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,880
Don't force me to point a gun at you.

113
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,020
- Second Sister, I... 
 - Yingqi, if you still want me to help you,

114
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:19,280
don't waste my time by making me guess what details you hid from me.

115
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,240
Tell me how Father fell.

116
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,040
Did you do it?

117
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,439
Sister, I didn't do it.

118
00:11:26,439 --> 00:11:28,040
Father wanted to beat me.

119
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,020
He... I dodged to the side, and he fell.

120
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,240
I swear. I didn't do it.

121
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,360
I... I didn't even touch his clothes.

122
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,619
 Uncle, I didn't know either that Yingxian would be in danger. 

123
00:11:40,619 --> 00:11:43,099
 However, since it has come to this, 

124
00:11:43,099 --> 00:11:48,000
 I hope it doesn't affect the partnership between the Jiang family and the Shen family. 

125
00:11:48,699 --> 00:11:51,240
 Yingxian's whereabouts are unknown. 

126
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,940
 Not only does the Shen family not show any remorse, 

127
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:58,519
 but you even want the Jiang family to take the blame. 

128
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,200
 Is this the sincerity you show in our partnership? 

129
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:06,710
 Uncle, it's exactly because Yingxian is missing 

130
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:09,760
 that this matter can be forgotten 

131
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,360
 if the Jiang family is willing to admit ownership of these goods 

132
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,420
 and pin the blame on Yingxian. 

133
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:19,540
 The loss is reduced to the minimum, 

134
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:23,360
 for both the Jiang family and the Shen family. 

135
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,339
 Oh, right. 

136
00:12:32,199 --> 00:12:37,519
 I heard Yingqi and Deputy Commander Lu's son were close. 

137
00:12:38,199 --> 00:12:44,000
 Governor Jin is investigating Deputy Commander Lu's bribery case. 

138
00:12:45,339 --> 00:12:49,300
 I only hope Yingqi won't be implicated. 

139
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:02,020
 Jiang Yingqi! 

140
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:22,099
 Uncle, I hope you consider it and make a decision soon. 

141
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,180
 Father. 

142
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,340
 Father. 

143
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:44,900
 - Father. 
 - You animal! 

144
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,679
Yingqi, tell me honestly.

145
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:58,280
After Father fell, did you go and call for help immediately?

146
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:03,799
I... I was stunned and waited for a few minutes.

147
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,780
Was Dad still awake at that time?

148
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:08,199
Did he know if you called for help immediately or not?

149
00:14:08,199 --> 00:14:11,000
I think he doesn't know.

150
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,140
He fell and twitched a few times.

151
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,799
I called him, but he didn't react.

152
00:14:16,859 --> 00:14:22,839
 It seems like Governor Jin is going to turn the Nanli Region upside down. 

153
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:25,799
 I wonder if the Jiang family can overcome this. 

154
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:28,599
 Internal conflicts must be dealt with before resolving external conflicts. 

155
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,780
   

156
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:23,820
   

157
00:15:34,129 --> 00:15:37,720
   

158
00:15:57,559 --> 00:16:01,459
Second Child gathered all of us here.

159
00:16:01,459 --> 00:16:04,319
What is she trying to do?

160
00:16:04,319 --> 00:16:05,619
What is she trying to do?

161
00:16:05,619 --> 00:16:08,360
Her father was admitted to the hospital recently.

162
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,679
I'm sure she's trying to usurp the power.

163
00:16:12,719 --> 00:16:16,760
In my opinion, Second Child has been doing well in recent years.

164
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,719
I agree to let her be the head of the Jiang family.

165
00:16:20,719 --> 00:16:24,760
Old Four, did Second Child give you any benefits?

166
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,940
Jiang Zhen has a son.

167
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:31,880
Even if he doesn't, he should also adopt one from other families of the clan.

168
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:35,760
A girl like her cannot be the head.

169
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,432
Third Brother, the Qing Dynasty has fallen.

170
00:16:38,432 --> 00:16:41,920
People are talking about the new mindset nowadays.

171
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,240
My daughter has been telling me about gender equality every day.

172
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,339
- Ridiculous! 
 - Indeed.

173
00:16:48,339 --> 00:16:52,319
We've tolerated her running the business outside.

174
00:16:52,319 --> 00:16:56,820
How can we leave the whole Jiang family's business to a girl like her?

175
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,799
Uncles.

176
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:05,379
I'm sorry for making all of you come here so late at night.

177
00:17:05,379 --> 00:17:09,160
However, this is urgent, so I had no choice.

178
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:13,439
Second Child, what is the urgent matter that requires you to gather all of us here?

179
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,220
Hold on.

180
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:20,160
In what capacity are you having this meeting with us today?

181
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,570
Naturally, I'm speaking as the head of the Jiang family.

182
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:30,970


183
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:59,380
♫  Reality is always different from imagination  ♫

184
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:02,300
♫  Plans can never keep up with change  ♫

185
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,020
♫  Caught between love and what's suitable  ♫

186
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:07,980
♫  There's nothing we can do  ♫

187
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:10,820
♫  We tell the ones we love we've never loved them before  ♫

188
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:13,680
♫  And act clueless in front of those we don't  ♫

189
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,120
♫  Listening to those who don't love me  ♫

190
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,460
♫  Say sweet words of how they do  ♫

191
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,940
♫  Asking myself if my love still exists?  ♫

192
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:22,100
♫  Have I forgotten it? Have I let it go?  ♫

193
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,940
♫  Do I still hold her in my heart?  ♫

194
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,740
♫  I don't have the courage to face the scars of the past  ♫

195
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,980
♫  I'm still unable to let it go  ♫

196
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,380
♫  Asking myself if I'm willing  ♫

197
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,460
♫  Can I bear it? Do I regret it?   ♫

198
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:36,340
♫  But it's impossible to turn back time  ♫

199
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:41,420
♫  I can only carry the memories and meet her in my dreams  ♫
