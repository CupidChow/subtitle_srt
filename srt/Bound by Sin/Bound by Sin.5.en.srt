00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:15,910
It's all done.

4
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:17,320
Don't worry.

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,350
It's all set.

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:20,920
Let's go.

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,280
I hope my sister will have a good day tomorrow.

8
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,840
Miss Jiang, we're here.

9
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,520
Don't you ask me

10
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,200
why we came to such a remote place at night?

11
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:11,070
Does it make you happy

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,790
to play with men?

13
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:16,120
You've had one man

14
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,760
after another around you,

15
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,070
so until when do you want to play?

16
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:24,640
Until I've had enough.

17
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:27,150
Don't move.

18
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:45,710
Let go of me.

19
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,040
Are you ordering me?

20
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,120
I said let go of me.

21
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,200
What if I don't?

22
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,640
What can you do to me?

23
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,680
It's never been my tie

24
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,760
that's held you down

25
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,750
but your own morals and principles,

26
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,560
so you'll never get away with it.

27
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,000
You know what?

28
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,560
It's my favorite thing to see

29
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,360
when you can barely stand it.

30
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,560
I wish you could be honest

31
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,680
about your own desires sooner.

32
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,840
It's so ironic.

33
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,150
My restraint and patience

34
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,080
are the very source of her pleasure.

35
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,520
Then why should I endure it?

36
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:42,520
Satisfied?

37
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:50,280
Sit tight.

38
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,360
I'll take you back.

39
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:53,910
No need.

40
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,280
Take me to Jiangbei Village.

41
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,870
I have to go to the ribbon cutting early tomorrow morning.

42
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,360
By the way,

43
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,590
I've been with one man

45
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:18,480

Boss, I just got here too.

52
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,630
These villagers claimed that we didn't give compensation,

53
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,040
prevented us from starting construction,

54
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,430
and injured our workers.

55
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,240
Weren't the villagers

56
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,830
moved half a month ago?

57
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,270
Why did so many villagers suddenly appear?

58
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,360
I don't know what the situation is now.

59
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,560
Now take him to get patched up

60
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,310
and ask a few people to surround the place.

61
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,390
Don't let the reporters take pictures.

62
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,560
Ask another person to go to the police station now.

63
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,630
Got it.

64
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,240
No matter what happens,

don't let it damage the Jiang family's reputation.

Given the situation,

68
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,190
it would be dangerous for you to go.

we can talk in detail.

89
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:11,630

Compensate. Stop right there.

91
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,750
They came prepared

92
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,390
and tried to surround you from the start.

93
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:20,510
I knew it.

94
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,190
You knew?

95
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,720
Then why did you go over there?

96
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,560
What? Are you angry?

97
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,870
Where are we going?

98
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,390
It's not the way back to the city.

100
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,390
Why Kun Shan?

Do you trust me?

102
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:44,750
Is anything wrong with the car?

103
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,510
Wrap all the clothes in the car around you.

Two.

112
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,120
One.

113
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,830
I told you

114
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,190
you'd be okay.

115
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:49,680
Come on.

116
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,510
Your injuries

117
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,830
need to be handled as soon as possible.

118
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:10,750
I'm fine.

119
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,950
We can't go back yet.

120
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,950
Find a place to hide for a few days.

121
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,950
Do you know who's setting you up?

122
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,480
Nine times out of ten, it's my brother,

123
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,190
but I don't have

124
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,800
any hard evidence right now.

125
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,040
I have to wait for Ke Rui to investigate.

126
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,720
Won't it be faster if we just call the police?

127
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:29,950
No.

128
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,750
If it's really my brother,

129
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,600
internal family conflicts

130
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,720
can only be resolved at home.

131
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:36,910
Once it's exposed,

132
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,720
it's damaging to the whole Jiang's.

133
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:40,600
No one would like a partner

134
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,390
with constant internal strife.

135
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:43,480
Is the reputation of Jiang's

136
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,840
more important than your life?

137
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,480
Of course not,

138
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,790
but when my life is not in danger,

139
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,480
Jiang's is my life.

140
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:56,390
Come on.

141
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:57,550
I'll carry you.

142
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,120
There's a village up ahead,

143
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,910
but at the rate we're going,

144
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:02,750
we won't get there even by nightfall.

145
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:03,870
Come on.

146
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,120
It was a very chaotic scene.

147
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,120
I saw boss,

148
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:20,720

[Jiang Zhen, the master of Gangcheng's Jiang family]
Miss Jiang getting into the car.

150
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,480
And then I don't know where she went.

151
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,750
After that, there was no news of her,

152
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,270
so I rushed to hire someone to look for her,

153
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,270
but in the end,

154
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,600
we only found her car.

155
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,150
Something was wrong with the car.

156
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,080
Master Jiang.

157
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,870
I heard something happened to Yingxian.

158
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:51,600
So now,

159
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:53,480
you only found Yingxian's car

160
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:55,120
and nothing else, right?

161
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:00,720
Master Jiang.

162
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,960
I got an overview on the way here.

163
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,480
It's not too bad now.

164
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,630
Maybe Yingxian was just injured

165
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:08,630
and tried to get help,

166
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,240
so she got lost in the neighborhood.

167
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,120
We've asked all the workers at Jiang's

168
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,390
to look for her.

169
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,320
You didn't ask the police to help?

170
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,440
Before her accident,

171
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:19,960
she specifically told me

172
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,080
that no matter what happened,

173
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,600
I couldn't publicize this

174
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,910
so as not to affect Jiang's reputation.

175
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,630
Stupid girl.

176
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,320
You're also stupid enough

177
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,200
to do what she said

178
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:38,360
regardless of the time or situation.

179
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:39,790
I apologize for being stupid.

180
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:42,320
Miss Jiang probably didn't realize

181
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,030
someone was tampering with her car

182
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,360
when she instructed me.

183
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,750
Did you learn anything

184
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:52,670
other than to apologize

185
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:53,910
when you studied in Japan?

186
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,200
You're a loser.

187
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,510
Now go to the police.

188

00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,440
Let me go with Ke Rui

192
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,390
and explain to him.

193
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,600
Thank you.

194
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,320
Yingjian.

195
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,390
Follow me upstairs.

196
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,510
Thanks, Mr. Shen.

197
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,080
Tell me.

198
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,630
Where is Yingxian now?

199
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,390
Boss is really missing,

200
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,360
or I wouldn't have taken the liberty of asking you

201
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,910
to play along in front of Master

202
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:40,480
to get his approval for us

203
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,240
to go looking for her openly.

204
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,120
Is something really happening to Yingxian?

205
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,440
If I hadn't invited you here tonight,

206
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,150
I'm afraid Master

207
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,080
would have thought the same as you.

208
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,510
Put me down.

209
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,750
My leg doesn't hurt anymore.

210
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,360
Don't worry.

211
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,270
When we enter the village,

212
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:14,840
we'll go to a certain house

213
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,600
and say that we're siblings who went up the mountain

214
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:17,600
but were accidentally injured.

215
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,670
Do we look like siblings?

216
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,630
I think we're like a couple on the run.

217
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,960
Say whatever you like.

218
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,630
You...

219
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:01,790
You have suffered greatly.

220
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:02,790
Your wound...

221
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,000
So

222
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,720
we decided to elope,

223
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,440
but on the way,

224
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,000
we were still caught up by my dad,

225
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,120
so we jumped out of the car.

226
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,480
Girl, stay here in peace.

227
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,200
Get well from your injuries before you go.

228
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,510
Thank you so much, ma'am.

229
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,480
These aren't anything valuable,

230
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,480
but they can still be exchanged for some money.

231
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,240
I can't take it.

232
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,150
Besides food,

233
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,870
we'd like you to bring us some medicine.

234
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:39,960
By the way,

235
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,910
you'll have to sell them

236
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:43,750
after we leave,

237
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:44,870
or I'm afraid

238
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,120
my father will find us.

239
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,510
Okay. Don't worry.

240
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:51,960
I won't divulge any information about you guys.

241
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,790
I'll go get you some medicine.

242
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,150
Thank you, ma'am.

243
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,270
What a nice girl.

244
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,840
Don't let her down.

245
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,440
It'll hurt a little.

246
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,080
I can bear it.

247
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:35,870
You don't have to.

248
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,320
You can cry and scream

249
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:39,960
whenever you want to.

250
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,080
You'll never be the most miserable screamer

251
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:43,600
I've ever seen.

252
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:51,790
I'm gonna do it now.

253
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,720
That's it.

254
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,670
Let me medicate you.

255
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,200
What?

256
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:28,840
Even now,

257
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,000
you're still afraid I'll take liberties?

258
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,240
Come on.

259
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:17,870
It's my job.

260
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,390
They just look scary,

261
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,600
but they're not that serious.

262
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,270
Come on.

263
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,080
I'm going to apply the alcohol now.
