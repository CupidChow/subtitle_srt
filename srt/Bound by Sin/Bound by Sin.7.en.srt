Of course not.

190
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,630
Zhou Xiaoqing

191
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,150
came to see you a few days ago, right?

192
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,200
Yes.

193
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,440
Is Shen Dongyang mad?

194
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:00,510
Is he unhappy with how I reacted?

195
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:01,840
Why?

196
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,000
This is your personal matter.

197
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,240
I shouldn't interfere,

198
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:06,510
but I do think

199
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,240
you could've handled it better.

200
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:11,320
Well...

201
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,150
You haven't changed at all, Jiang Yingxian.

202
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,910
But she told me everything

203
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,440
you two talked about.

204
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:20,670
Oh, did she?

205
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,480
I see.

206
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,600
As his fiancée,

207
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,720
when his mistress showed up at my door,

208
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,120
I was supposed to be angry,

209
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,360
upset,

210
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,480
or at least throw out a few sarcastic remarks,

211
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,270
even though that would only annoy him.

212
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:36,630
The point is,

213
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,720
in his eyes, there can only be people who are rejected by him,

214
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,480
not the other way around.

215
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,630
Did you tell her

216
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,320
your life is on the line because of me?

217
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:52,960
Yes.

218
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,120
Isn't that true?

219
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,670
Good.

220
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,080
Straightforward as always.

221
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,510
It suits our relationship, which is based on mutual benefits.

222
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,480
There are ways to handle a relationship built on interests,

223
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:10,200
and there are ways to handle one based on love.

224
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,240
Yingxian,

225
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,000
how do you want to handle ours?

226
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:20,440
If I can't fall in love with Shen Dongyang,

227
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:23,630
then I'll have no choice but to stick to the former.

228
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:27,360
I hope my self-punishment will be enough

229
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,030
to make him drop the topic.

Enough, Jiang Yingxian.

256
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,240
Stop drinking.

257
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:11,550
Have you had your fill, Mr. Shen?

258
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,670
I brought this from Haicheng.

259
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,390
You haven't eaten anything today.

260
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,360
Take it home. Have it as a late-night snack.

261
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,790
You could've smoothed things over with a few sweet words,

262
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:33,080
but no,

263
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,390
you chose to drink

264
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,550
and throw soft jabs at me.

265
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,030
What a troublesome personality.

266
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,750
Thank you for the gift.

267
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,240
Let me walk you home.

268
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,630
It's okay.

269
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,360
Ke Rui will take me back.

270
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,640
Zhou Xiaoqing

271
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,550
really doesn't deserve any sympathy.

272
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,400
The moment she saw him, she sold me out completely.

273
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,920
Her tears are genuine,

274
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,480
but her manipulations are real too.

275
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,960
Shen Dongyang and I are no different.

276
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,790
We look decent on the outside,

277
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,640
but inside, we're both falling apart.

278
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,000
I'm worse than Shen Dongyang,

279
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,880
but no one knows.

280
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:45,920
No,

281
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,830
there's one person who knows.

282
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,830
You look like the person I was talking about.

283
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:04,830
Get on.

284
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,680

Who do you think you are?

286
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,440
I'm Fu Cheng.

287
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:11,920
Jiang Yingxian,

288
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,030
