to admire these photos.

190
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,790
Miss Jiang,

191
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,030
are you out of your mind?

192
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:08,080
Not yet.

193
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,550
This is just a little hobby of mine.

194
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,790
Also,

195
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,080
based on my judgment,

196
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,390
it seems you value

197
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,840
dignity more than wealth.

198
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,200
It is you who needs something from me,

199
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,030
so you'd better not haggle.

200
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:23,600
Of course,

201
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,080
we can discuss other options,

202
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,510
but Fu Zhi might not be able to wait that long.

203
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,870
I'm a man.

204
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,320
Even if these photos leak,

205
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,550
it won't affect me at all.

206
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,480
Then why hesitate?

207
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,440
Go ahead and undress.

208
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,080
Keep going.

209
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:32,240
Mr. Fu,

210
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,750
please spin around twice.

211
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:02,390
Is that enough?

212
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:12,320
Why, in such an embarrassing situation,

213
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,270
would you still...?

214
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,790
Stop talking.

215
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:20,600
What do you think of my lips?

216
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,360
Or do you

217
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,750
prefer my legs?

218
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,200
Enough!

219
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,240
That's enough, Mr. Fu.

220
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,030
It seems pointless to say this now,

221
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,200
but this is just a transaction.

222
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,840
Miss Jiang,

223
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,480
I hope you keep your word.

224
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,080
After you leave my office,

225
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,270
Ke Rui will take you to collect the money.

226
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,670
I have a suggestion that might

227
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:56,600
benefit Miss Fu more.

228
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,630
Would you like to hear it?

229
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:02,600
Although her condition is stable now,

230
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,440
we don't know when she'll wake up.

231
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,550
She needs more professional care.

232
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:11,080
A private sanatorium would be better for her.

233
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,440
So, what's the catch?

234
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,120
When Xu Yawei hit you,

235
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:16,840
what were you thinking?

236
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,630
What?

237
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:20,720
Nothing.

238
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,670
You look down on her.

239
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,670
You look down on people like us.

240
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,960
So, is that the catch?

241
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,150
You just wanted to ask me a question?

242
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:31,960
Mr. Fu,

243
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,510
you really overestimate yourself.

244
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,320
She didn't force me at any point.

245
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:37,510
She just laid out her conditions

246
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,390
and let me make my own choice.

247
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,510
But I don't really have any other options.

248
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,240
So, what's the real catch?

249
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,600
I heard you were in the military up north.

250
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:59,080
Are you interested in working

251
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,750
as my personal bodyguard?

252
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,550
It's just a suggestion.

253
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,670
Take some time to think about it before answering me.

254
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:09,240
Miss Jiang, it shouldn't be hard for you

255
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,200
to find a bodyguard.

256
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:14,270
As I said, it's just a suggestion.

257
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,150
Other than that,

258
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,600
you can also be my plaything.

259
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,270
You...!

260
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,840
Alright then, from today onward,

261
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,440
you'll be my personal bodyguard.

262
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:26,600
Pleasure working with you.

263
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,510
You're going too far.

264
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,150
Mr. Shen, you can't go in!

265
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:33,870
Boss.

266
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,840
Jiang Yingxian,

267
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,360
how long are you going

268
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,270
to keep playing hard to get?

269
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,360
Your family needs me,

270
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,390
so stop playing this game.

271
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,910
My dear fiancée,

272
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:19,660
[Files]

273
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:22,320
for the sake of our families' reputation,

274
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:24,870
I hope you can get rid

275
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,790
of some of your little, unimportant habits.

276
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,790
- Miss Jiang. - Miss Jiang.

277
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:40,150
Miss Jiang, look at the camera.

278
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:42,750
- One more shot. - Miss Jiang.

279
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:43,630
Look at me.

280
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,670
- Miss Jiang. - Miss Jiang.

281
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:47,720
Greetings, Miss Jiang.

282
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:54,320
- Miss Jiang. - Miss Jiang.

283
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,200
Miss Jiang, turn around.

284
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,440
- Over here. - Over here, Miss Jiang.
