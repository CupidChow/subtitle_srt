The cake fell to the ground.

00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,110
This is bad.

00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:46,880
It's for Fu Cheng.

00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,670
Drop the act.

7
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:49,560
Jiang Yingxian,

8
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,520
you've sobered up already, haven't you?

9
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:57,640
So,

10
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:00,430
did you tail me

11
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:02,470
to rob me, Mr. Fu?

12
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:09,870
I tailed you?

13
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:15,350
I'm just doing my job as your bodyguard.

14
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,000
You're hurting me.

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,120
You've drunk a lot.

16
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:52,790
You smell nice today.

17
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,920
But you smell

18
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,430
quite different today.

19
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,480
Cologne worn by men?

20
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,200
Did you and Shen Dongyang get physical?

21
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,120
Are you nuts?

22
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,680
Why on earth did I bring this humiliation on myself?

23
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,590
Give me a hand.

24
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,470
Why did you get mad

25
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,360
and push me so hard?

26
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,150
Say something.

27
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:52,560
Does it hurt?

28
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,400
Yes,

29
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,400
it hurts a lot.

30
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,400

No,

I don't want pain relief patches.

00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,510
I thought your stomach might hurt from drinking a lot last night,

123
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,840
so I brought some breakfast to help your digestion.

00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,440

127
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,200
I heard the Jiang family

00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,910
in charge of this matter,

131
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,510
so there shouldn't be any problems.

00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,200
Thank you,

133
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,320
I'll be sure to visit your father with a nice gift

134
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,550

135
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,320
We're family,

136
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,030
so there's no need to stand on ceremony.

137
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:07,510
In a couple of days,

138
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:08,480
my cousin

139
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,360
is having her 18th birthday party.

140
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,120
Will you have time to join me?

141
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,080
I'll clear my schedule for that day.

142
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:22,320
You did a great job with the Xijiang Dock.

143
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,960
Thanks to Dongyang for his help.

144
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:28,030
Dongyang's father called me the other day

145
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,200
and mentioned your engagement.

146
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,000
Mr. Shen thinks

147
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,510
it's been almost a year

148
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,630
since you two got engaged,

149
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:39,720
and he hopes

150
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,750
you'll get married by the end of this year.

151
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,670
I know a bit

152
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,000
about Dongyang's situation,

153
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,030
but let's face it,

154
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,910
men are rarely without their flirtations.

155
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:58,910
However,

156
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,150
once they settle down and get married,

157
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,200
they usually settle down.

158
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:10,320
If marriage alone could fix a man's wandering heart,

159
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,000
then I wouldn't still be handling

160
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,120
the Jiang Yingsi case.

161
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:14,870
I understand.

162
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,390
Yingxian,

163
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,670
I know you the best.

164
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,120
You're not just clever and sharp,

165
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,200
but also composed and level-headed,

166
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,320
so

167
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,480
you should know exactly

168
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,630
what matters most

169
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,360
for both you

170
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,000
and the Jiang's,

171
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,360
not like your elder brother.

172
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,390
Well, of course,

173
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,120
you're always saying

174
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,600
that I'm the one most like you, right?

175
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,320
If you were a boy,

176
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,510
that would be great,

177
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,600
and life

178
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,670
would be so much easier for me!

179
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,080
Come in.

180
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:20,360
Boss,

181
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,390
Mr. Shen sent this here.

182
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:23,720
It's a dress

183

184

Leave it here.

185
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,270
How are things

186
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,390
with Jiang Yingsi now?

187
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,910
Our men have gotten in touch

188
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:34,960
with him secretly.

189
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,120
If you don't mind,

190
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,480
we should be able to meet him soon.

191
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,600
Arrange for a meeting as soon as possible.

192
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:43,910
Well,

193
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:45,390
Fu Cheng took leave.

194
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,150
Maybe you can meet Jiang Yingsi after he's back?

195
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:49,480
In case there is any mishap.

196
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:50,480
He took leave?

197
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,600
The hospital said Fu Zhi was awake,

198
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,600
so he needed to take care of his sister for a few days

199
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:55,790
and see how she was doing.

200
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,150
I thought he was mad.

201
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:01,200
He was what?

202
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:03,670
Nothing.

203
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
No need to wait for him.

204
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,000
Just arrange for a meeting with Jiang Yingsi for me soon.

205
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:10,550
Yes.

206
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:34,320
Cheng,

207
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,440
is something bothering you?

208
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:38,960
No.

209
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,080
Just get some rest.

210
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,000
I got to go now.

211
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,840
Cheng, aren't you going to stay with me?

212
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,510
Just focus on your recovery.

213
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:53,840
When you fully recover,

214
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:55,720
I will take you home.

215
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:56,670
Then,

216
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,360
does it mean we can

217
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,870
go back to our old house soon?

218
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:05,360
Uncle Fu,

219
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,910
I need details on Shen Dongyang.

220
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:13,550
After the marriage between the Jiang and Shen families,

221
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,550
the Jiang family will undoubtedly become even more unstoppable,

222
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,630
so we definitely need to pay attention to the Shen family.

223
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,870
What exactly does this person

224
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,550
mean to Jiang Yingxian?

225
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,000
She's treating that person as her own life and soul.

226
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,150
- Miss Jiang. - Miss Jiang.

227
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:44,870
Miss Jiang.

228
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,120
Miss Jiang.

229
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:06,480
[Lu Wanting, Shen Dongyang's cousin]
Miss Lu,

230
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:07,510
happy birthday.

231
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,360
Thank you, Yingxian.

232
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,030
You two carry on.

233
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,150
I'll go attend to the guests.

234
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:22,200
This qipao

235
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,200
suits you very well.

236
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,240
Keep the occasion in mind.

237
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,080
My fiancée,

238
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,150
you've been a bit distracted recently.

239
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,510
Let me help you make up your mind.

240
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:35,390
Miss Jiang.

241
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,630
Miss Jiang,

242
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,440
this is what you asked me to get.

243
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,240
I forgot to tell you

244
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,670
that I told Fu Cheng to get it.

245
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,200
I only realized I forgot to bring it with me

246
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:00,670
when I arrived at the hotel.

247
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:04,160
I planned to ask Ke Rui to help me get it,

248
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,350
but she told me

249
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:08,960
that Mr. Fu

250
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:10,640
