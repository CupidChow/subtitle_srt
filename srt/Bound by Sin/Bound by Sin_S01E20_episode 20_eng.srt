1
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:15,110


2
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:31,680
 ♫ Drifting aimlessly Not knowing where to go ♫ 

3
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:37,340
 ♫ The moonlight tonight feels sorrowful ♫ 

4
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:42,680
 ♫ I stand alone against it ♫ 

5
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,980
 ♫ But I don't want to ♫ 

6
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:51,580
 ♫ The longing catches me off guard ♫ 

7
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:59,180
 ♫ To the silent night, I surrender myself ♫ 

8
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:11,680
 ♫ Tossing and turning, lost in confusion In the darkness, I lose my way ♫ 

9
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:33,160
   

10
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,980
 

11
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,680
We are asked to guard the rich man's house,
but we can't take action.

12
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,120
I wonder what the Governor wants.

13
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,999
We just do what our superior asks for.

14
00:01:51,999 --> 00:01:53,760
We don't even know who our commander will be tomorrow.

15
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,600
Just don't cause trouble.

16
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,380
Who's there?

17
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,239
Ke Rui, it's me.

18
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,079
- Boss, you're back. 
 - Second Sister.

19
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:37,200
You are finally back.

20
00:02:39,042 --> 00:02:40,559
Why are the lights off at home?

21
00:02:40,559 --> 00:02:42,380
The power lines around the place have been cut.

22
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:45,539
It's chaotic right now and no one is coming to fix it.

23
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:49,280
When I entered the city, I heard about Gangcheng's situation.

24
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,679
When I got around the wall to come inside, I saw guards keeping watch outside.

25
00:02:53,679 --> 00:02:55,160
What's going on at the house now?

26
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,920
All of us are fine.

27
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:01,119
Governor Jin doesn't allow people to plunder our house, but he also stops us from going out.

28
00:03:01,119 --> 00:03:04,679
I still don't know what's going on at your uncles' houses.

29
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:08,900
Second Sister, didn't you two come from the Revolutionary Army?

30
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,519
Did you ask them to save us?

31
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:17,699
I sent the message to them but I don't know whether the army will come or not.

32
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:20,119
Second Sister, what should we do?

33
00:03:20,119 --> 00:03:23,119
Are we just going to succumb to fate?

34
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,679
I heard about Governor Jin.

35
00:03:26,679 --> 00:03:29,040
He might be sent here by the Central Government,

36
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,600
but he has a neutral opinion on the Revolutionary Army.

37
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,459
Governor Jin doesn't allow others to hurt us.

38
00:03:40,299 --> 00:03:43,000
We should be fine for now.

39
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,900
It seems like he has an ulterior motive.

40
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,200
Tomorrow,

41
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,440
I'll go and meet Governor Jin.

42
00:03:58,119 --> 00:04:00,119
Officers, please send a message.

43
00:04:00,119 --> 00:04:02,119
I hope to meet Governor Jin.

44
00:04:02,119 --> 00:04:05,239
Who are you? Do you think you can meet Governor Jin as you wish?

45
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:07,979
I am the head of the Jiang family, Jiang Yingxian.

46
00:04:10,559 --> 00:04:11,900
We can help you send the message

47
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:15,119
but whether Governor Jin meets you or not is out of our control.

48
00:04:15,119 --> 00:04:16,679
Thank you.

49
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,960
Miss Jiang. It has been so long.

50
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,840
I wonder why you are asking to meet me today.

51
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:29,257
I'm only asking to meet you for one purpose, Governor Jin.

52
00:04:29,257 --> 00:04:31,636
To secure a better future for the Jiang family.

53
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:36,879
I wonder what you are planning, Miss Jiang.

54
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:44,040
You should know that merchants can only make money when the social environment is safe.

55
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,380
Previously, Commander Chen allowed smuggling among his subordinates

56
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,720
and the Nan Army's discipline was a mess.

57
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,420
So, the Central Government sent you to supervise.

58
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:55,420
Getting rid of Commander Chen is a great help to the people.

59
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,280
It makes everyone happy.

60
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:03,840
However, Commander Chen is the president's relative after all.

61
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,440
You should be worried about your future, right?

62
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:13,139
I believe you are different from Commander Chen, Governor Jin.

63
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:17,840
The Jiang family is also hoping to serve you under your governance.

64
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,919
However, I was wondering which path you would lead us to.

65
00:05:25,239 --> 00:05:29,180
Miss Jiang, are you teaching me how to do things?

66
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,439
You've misunderstood. I'm just an ordinary civilian.

67
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:33,879
I dare not teach you how to do things.

68
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:40,099
However, we also hope to have a long-lasting relationship with you.

69
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,840
Ask the person supporting you to come here.

70
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,500
This isn't something a merchant like you should discuss.

71
00:05:56,019 --> 00:05:57,879
Hello, Governor Jin.

72
00:05:57,879 --> 00:06:01,040
I'm Fu Cheng, a major in the Revolutionary Army.

73
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,960
Here.

74
00:06:21,359 --> 00:06:22,899
Is it done?

75
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,300
The discussion is going well for now.

76
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:32,500
However, after going back, I still need to report the details to my superior

77
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,960
and ask them to send someone to liaise with Governor Jin.

78
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,600
Are you going back tomorrow?

79
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,559
Yingxian.

80
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,740
 ♫ You've set off ♫ 

81
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:17,020
 ♫ To warm another world ♫ 

82
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,140
 ♫ I've stopped ♫ 

83
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:22,020
 ♫ But never said goodbye to the past ♫ 

84
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,580
 ♫ Watching you leave,
I mourn, and sorrow lingers ♫ 

85
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,060
 ♫ Tears of regret, pain running deep ♫ 

86
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:31,660
 ♫ You've gone to a world that isn't yours ♫ 

87
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:38,300
- Yingxian. 
 - Let's take a wedding photo.

88
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,960
Sure.

89
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:44,370
 ♫ The past has been cremated ♫ 

90
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:50,260
 ♫ Placed in the urn of my heart ♫ 

91
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,260
 ♫ Crying, I say ♫ 

92
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:56,980
 ♫ I'm not afraid anymore,
I've forgotten the hurt ♫ 

93
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,500
 ♫ You, singing a song ♫ 

94
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,020
 ♫ Stand barefoot in the river of my life ♫ 

95
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,580
 ♫ The past has been cremated ♫ 

96
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:10,340
 ♫ No longer relying on anyone to live ♫ 

97
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,999
Go!

98
00:08:49,439 --> 00:08:51,040
Boss.

99
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,820
We have given this batch's medicine to Governor Jin.

100
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,739
He said he would arrange for them to be delivered to the front lines.

101
00:08:56,739 --> 00:08:58,160
All right.

102
00:09:00,719 --> 00:09:04,240
Send this briefcase of gold bars to the dock in person.

103
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,300
This is the deposit for the next batch of supplies.

104
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:10,454
We have donated a lot of supplies to the Revolutionary Army.

105
00:09:10,454 --> 00:09:14,615
This should be all the money we have.

106
00:09:15,339 --> 00:09:23,040
This won't affect the Jiang's business, but perhaps the supplies will go to his hands.

107
00:09:24,699 --> 00:09:29,199
Perhaps it will give him a bit more hope.

108
00:09:36,979 --> 00:09:40,240
 Yingxian, these words serve as my presence. 

109
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,699
 While we are apart, I've always missed you. 

110
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,430
 However, due to the war,  

111
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:53,840
 I can only write my feelings for you into my letters. 

112
00:09:53,840 --> 00:10:00,680
 I hope I can bring them back to you one day in the future, and tell you all about it. 

113
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,320
 However, if there's one day I can't return to your side, 

114
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,720
 I hope you can find someone else... 

115
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,440
 who loves you more than I do. 

116
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,246
 Yingxian, we won another battle today. 

117
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:24,320
 It seems like we have taken another step forward towards the peace that everyone wishes for. 

118
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:32,359
 Yingxian, more and more comrades have left us forever. 

119
00:10:33,319 --> 00:10:35,500
 It pains me,  

120
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:43,000
 but I must endure the emotions, and keep moving forward. 

121
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,600
   

122
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:52,800
   

123
00:10:57,599 --> 00:10:58,840
We won!

124
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,080
- We won! 
 - Long live the Revolutionary Army!

125
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,040
- Welcome, the Revolutionary Army! 
 - Long live the Revolutionary Army!

126
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,880
They are finally here!

127
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,360
- We won! 
 - Long live the Revolutionary Army!

128
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,079
Fu Cheng.

129
00:11:11,719 --> 00:11:16,739
 Yingxian. I thought I heard your voice today, 

130
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:23,399
 but when I turned back, they were all strangers. 

131
00:11:24,008 --> 00:11:27,680
 I can't wait to return to your side. 

132
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:36,900
 ♫ In winter's chill, you said "I love you" right ♫ 

133
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:44,710
 ♫ A thousand snowflakes softly land ♫ 

134
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,640
Jiang Yingxian.

135
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:56,500
 ♫ The wooden bench on the street ♫ 

136
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,500
 ♫ It recalls our first sweet meet ♫ 

137
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:05,740
 ♫ Your smile is etched in my heart ♫ 

138
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:09,420
 ♫ That bench would remember ♫ 

139
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:12,930
 ♫ How we held each other tightly ♫ 

140
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:17,940
♫ ♫

141
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:21,740
 

142
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:34,890


143
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:57,920
 ♫ I don't want to hear
the shattered sounds of the past ♫ 

144
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,700
 ♫ My crumpled heart is now misshapen ♫ 

145
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:09,840
 ♫ It's the wind that rises,
taking my thoughts of you with it ♫ 

146
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:15,220
 ♫ And when the wind stops,
my longing doesn't cease ♫ 

147
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:22,780
 ♫ So how do we write regret? ♫ 

148
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:29,000
 ♫ Is it the silent, lingering scenes? ♫ 

149
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,940
 ♫ Or is it the ending we tore apart ourselves? ♫ 

150
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:41,160
 ♫ Until emotions gradually wither and mature,
fading away ♫ 

151
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,860
 ♫ Regret is the maple forest in slumber ♫ 

152
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:47,500
 ♫ It's the heavy snow falling outside the window ♫ 

153
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:54,100
 ♫ It's the story that should have been yours
but has no ending ♫ 

154
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,860
 ♫ Turns out poets are used ♫ 

155
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:59,900
 ♫ To writing regret beautifully ♫ 

156
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,590
 ♫ The tears that spill ♫ 

157
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,050
 ♫ Soaking a page ♫ 

158
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,660
 ♫ I stare out the window ♫ 

159
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:09,020
 ♫ No longer searching for the right words ♫ 

160
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:31,520
 ♫ I don't want to hear
the shattered sounds of the past ♫ 

161
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:36,500
 ♫ My crumpled heart is now misshapen ♫ 

162
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:43,320
 ♫ It's the wind that rises,
taking my thoughts of you with it ♫ 

163
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:49,020
 ♫ And when the wind stops,
my longing doesn't cease ♫ 

164
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:54,460
 ♫ So how do we write regret? ♫
