1
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:15,110


2
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,680
♫  Wandering aimlessly with no destination in mind  ♫

3
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:37,340
♫  Tonight's moonlight feels desolate  ♫

4
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,680
♫  Alone, I try to block it out  ♫

5
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,880
♫  But unexpectedly  ♫

6
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:51,880
♫  The longing is unavoidable  ♫

7
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:59,980
♫  The silent night compels me to surrender  ♫

8
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:11,780
♫  Wandering in the darkness, I lose my way  ♫

9
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:33,280
   

10
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,080
   

11
00:02:00,639 --> 00:02:03,040
Let me take care of your wound first.

12
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,400
There are no female soldiers in the camp,

13
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,370
and the few nurses we have are busy assisting

14
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:13,160
the military physicians with Ke Rui's surgery.

15
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,480
Thanks, but it's fine.

16
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,380
I'm not injured.

17
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:36,499
It's fine. I just wasn't prepared for it.

18
00:02:36,499 --> 00:02:39,760
- Please continue. 
 - Let's clean it first.

19
00:02:45,119 --> 00:02:46,800
I'll apply alcohol now.

20
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,900
♫  It remained silent  ♫

21
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,740
♫  Unfortunately, we could only meet and not be together  ♫

22
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:59,340
♫  Our deep love was not fated  ♫

23
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,860
♫  I once asked the wind of your return  ♫

24
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:09,440
With things so dangerous around Haicheng, what are you doing here?

25
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,200
I was helping Shen Dongyang pick up a shipment.

26
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,239
Did you not read the files I gave you?

27
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:18,219
Do you know what business Shen Dongyang is in now?

28
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,079
- Arms trafficking. 
 - And you still came here?

29
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:23,939
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

30
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:27,619
I only figured it out after I got here.

31
00:03:36,679 --> 00:03:39,359
There are supply trucks leaving tomorrow that will take you to Gangcheng.

32
00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:42,160
The higher-ups have cleared it. You can head back first.

33
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,119
Ke Rui won't be able to move for a while after surgery.

34
00:03:44,119 --> 00:03:47,440
Once she's better, I'll send her back, too.

35
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,779
I want to stay here and leave with Ke Rui.

36
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:59,580
Do you think staying in the camp will keep you safe?

37
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:03,320
The Nan Army could attack at any time. Do you understand?

38
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,519
I believe you'll keep me safe.

39
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,539
Don't you think you're being a bit too confident?

40
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:21,600
Sorry, I misspoke.

41
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,290
What I meant is that

42
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:26,190
I have full confidence in your ability and sense of responsibility.

43
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:29,899
I believe you'll protect every...

44
00:04:32,559 --> 00:04:34,299
civilian.

45
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,020
Mr. Shen, Miss Jiang didn't manage to pick up the goods.

46
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,119
The Green Axe Gang really can't be trusted.

47
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:08,099
So are they holding them hostage, and making the Jiang family pay a ransom?

48
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:11,520
The goods were seized by the Revolutionary Army.

49
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,199
What?

50
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,840
How did that happen?

51
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,300
When the gang and Miss Jiang clashed,

52
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,640
a Revolutionary Army patrol happened to be nearby.

53
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:31,200
Ever since they sent that Jin guy here, things have been getting tougher.

54
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:36,419
I was hoping to use the Jiang family to wrap up this last deal,

55
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,559
but still, things went wrong.

56
00:05:38,559 --> 00:05:44,359
Mr. Shen, it's possible that Governor Jin knows about this batch of goods now.

57
00:05:44,359 --> 00:05:47,500
They're investigating.

58
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:52,320
If we can't explain ourselves,

59
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,250
we might get accused of colluding with the enemy.

60
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,100
Well, it's up to the Jiang family

61
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:03,770
to help us stay out of this mess.

62
00:06:07,627 --> 00:06:09,800
 I lose every time when we play cards. 

63
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,496
 That guy there always wins. 

64
00:06:12,496 --> 00:06:14,180
 - Yeah. 
 - I just don't believe it. 

65
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,149
 Why do I keep losing? 

66
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:21,960
I knew it.

67
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:26,070
This gigolo used his body to rise through the ranks.

68
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,610
Exactly.

69
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:33,260
Li Biao, what did you just say?

70
00:06:37,679 --> 00:06:41,040
I was talking about you. What are you going to do?

71
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,920
Let go of me! Let go!

72
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,020
Li Biao, if you have a problem with me, take it to the higher-ups.

73
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,999
Stop gossiping behind my back.

74
00:07:05,999 --> 00:07:08,160
It's not very manly.

75
00:07:12,239 --> 00:07:14,020
Come with me.

76
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,119
Pah!

77
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,960
Jiang Yingxian, do you have any idea who those people outside are?

78
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,580
The warlords have been fighting each other

79
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,480
and are recruiting bandits into their armies.

80
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:45,180
Each one of those men has blood on their hands!

81
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:48,520
And only they know whether it's the enemy's blood

82
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,220
or someone else's.

83
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,319
How dare you pull a gun in front of them?

84
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:57,020
Do you realize they could've shot you by instinct

85
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,950
even if they didn't plan to kill you?

86
00:08:01,779 --> 00:08:07,440
At that distance, every single one of them could've easily shot through your heart!

87
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,720
Answer me.

88
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,700
Why did you pull the gun?

89
00:08:17,799 --> 00:08:19,659
Answer me!

90
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,299
He insulted you.

91
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,380
You're clearly not that kind of person.

92
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:45,590
Jiang Yingxian, why do you give a shit about what they say about me?

93
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:47,699
You curse now?

94
00:08:47,699 --> 00:08:51,779
Jiang Yingxian, what do you want from me?

95
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,880
Jiang Yingxian, why do you always do this?

96
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:18,280
If you never intended to be with me, then don't mess with me.

97
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,679
♫  Pains my heart  ♫

98
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:23,219
Fu Cheng.

99
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:32,460
♫  I won't say anything. I know you have a lot to say  ♫

100

♫  That are stuck in your throat  ♫

♫  To you share about your life with him  ♫

00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,480
♫  The tears hidden behind the mask  ♫

106
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:07,559
♫  Cling to this false love  ♫

107
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:13,479
Do you think you can just walk away to get married after using me for your fun?

108
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:15,200
What am I to you?

109
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,320
A distraction?

110
00:10:22,599 --> 00:10:24,760
Am I that cheap to you?

111
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:27,420
Fu Cheng,

112
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:33,310
you're the cleanest, purest person I've ever met.

113
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,899
You're amazing.

114
00:10:36,479 --> 00:10:38,360
A wonderful man.

115
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,199
So much so that it makes me jealous.

116
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:45,380
♫  The more I care, the greater the pain  ♫

117
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:51,059
 If my good nature is the reason for all this unbearable pain, 

118
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:55,799
 then I'd rather throw it all away when I'm with you. 

119
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,510
♫  The tears hidden behind the mask   ♫

120

♫  Cling to this false love  ♫

121
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:12,340
♫  It's not that I'm insecure, but that I feel guilty  ♫

122
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,680

123
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,220

124
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,503

125

♫  I love you yet never hear the words back  ♫

126
00:11:53,599 --> 00:11:58,880
You should go back with the supply convoy leaving tonight.

127
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,240
It's not safe to stay in the camp.

128
00:12:02,699 --> 00:12:05,170
I know you have concerns about going back.

129
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:09,770
So, tonight, I'll personally lead the convoy.

130
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,920
All right.

131
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,000
Ke Rui has woken up.

132
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,299
I'll take you to see her this afternoon.

133
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,640
You...

134
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,620
Behave yourself.

135
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,390
Where's that noise coming from?

136
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,870
What?

137
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,679
Major.

138
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:04,760
- What's going on? 
 - We've spotted a large Nan Army force up ahead.

139
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,719
Should we continue forward?

140
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,739
The explosion just now was likely from Haicheng.

141
00:13:12,439 --> 00:13:16,540
It's probably our camp that's been attacked.

142
00:13:17,319 --> 00:13:19,319
Let's head back to Haicheng. Keep a low profile on the way.

143
00:13:19,319 --> 00:13:21,160
Yes, sir.

144
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,920
Prepare to march. Follow me!

145
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,740
- Yes, sir! 
 - Yes, sir!

146
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:41,899
The explosion we heard likely means our camp has been attacked by the Nan Army.

147
00:13:41,899 --> 00:13:43,440
And now,

148
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:47,170
we've spotted their forces up ahead as well.

149
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:52,400
It's extremely dangerous to keep heading to Gangcheng now.

150
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,920
I'm going back with you.

151
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,680
But if you go back to the camp with us now,

152
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:59,650
I can't guarantee your safety.

153
00:13:59,656 --> 00:14:02,880
I'm really sorry.

154
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:08,319
I didn't expect to put you in such a difficult position.

155
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,799
I trust you. I believe you'll keep me safe.

156
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,540
All right.

157
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:44,890
Major,

158
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:47,020
the northern part of the city has almost entirely fallen to the Nan Army.

159
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,799
- Luckily, our camp didn't suffer too much damage. 
 - Good.

160
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:51,839
- Reinforcements will be here soon. 
 - Good.

161
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,040
Now, as long as we maintain control of the south

162
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,599
and keep the enemy from advancing, we can take back the north.

163
00:14:56,599 --> 00:14:58,559
Arrange for everyone to take a short break.

164
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,799
Once the reinforcements arrive, we'll launch a counterattack.

165
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:01,959
Understood.

166
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:04,179
Everyone, follow me!

167
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:14,030


168
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:17,599
Here, drink this.

169
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:39,480
♫  I often think back to when we last met  ♫

170
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,171
Fu Cheng.

171
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:49,339
Please stay safe.

172
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:55,000
♫  And my words turned into a goodbye  ♫

173
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,839
Major, the reinforcements have arrived.

174
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,959
Good. Strike back!

175
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,300
Yes, sir!

176
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:04,960
♫  Life is long, the world is vast  ♫

177
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:09,000
♫  Farewell could be any moment  ♫

178
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,760
♫  The words we didn't finish  ♫

179
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:15,820
♫  Become a knot in time  ♫

180
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:20,260
♫  I once asked the wind of your return  ♫

181
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:23,460
♫  It remained silent  ♫

182
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:27,500
♫  Unfortunately, we could only meet and not be together  ♫

183
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,400
♫  Our deep love was not fated  ♫

184
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:34,900
♫  I once asked the wind of your return  ♫

185
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:38,120
♫  You remained silent  ♫

186
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,700
♫  Years past, and it's difficult to meet  ♫

187
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:50,800
♫  I only vaguely see you in the crowd  ♫

188
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,900
♫  Life is long, the world is vast  ♫

189
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:09,000
♫  Farewell could be any moment  ♫
