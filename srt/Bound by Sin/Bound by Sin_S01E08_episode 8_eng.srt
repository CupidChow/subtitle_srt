1
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:13,880
 

2
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:25,050


3
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:44,180
The cake fell to the ground.

4
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,825
This is bad. It's for Fu Cheng.

5
00:00:46,825 --> 00:00:48,659
Drop the act.

6
00:00:48,659 --> 00:00:50,430
Jiang Ying Xian,

7
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:53,620
you've sobered up already, haven't you?

8
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:03,369
So, did you tail me to rob me, Mr. Fu?

9
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,879
I tailed you?

10
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:16,159
I'm just doing my job as your bodyguard.

11
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:18,800
You're hurting me.

12
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,120
You've drunk a lot.

13
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:53,873
You smell nice today.

14
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:01,239
But you smell quite different today.

15
00:02:02,256 --> 00:02:04,317
Cologne worn by men?

16
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:08,183
Did you and Shen Dong Yang get physical?

17
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:13,010
Are you nuts?

18
00:02:14,539 --> 00:02:17,580
 Why on earth did I bring this humiliation
on myself? 

19
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,499
Give me a hand.

20
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:39,340
Why did you get mad and push me so hard?

21
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,079
Say something.

22
00:02:51,799 --> 00:02:55,420
- Does it hurt?
- Yes, it hurts a lot.

23
00:03:03,679 --> 00:03:07,959
I've treated plenty of broken bones
and dislocations in the army.

24
00:03:08,839 --> 00:03:11,139
You haven't even hurt your tendons or bones.

25
00:03:11,139 --> 00:03:13,139
Why are you pretending to be in pain?

26
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,880
Why did you push me?

27
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,959
Jiang Ying Xian, I'm your toy.

28
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,620
If you...

29
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,226
Never mind.
I'll get you some pain relief patches.

30
00:03:28,226 --> 00:03:31,986
No, I don't want pain relief patches.

31
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,879
Just blow on it.

32
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:48,800
How perfunctory. Do it seriously.

33
00:03:53,119 --> 00:03:54,270
Give it a kiss too.

34
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:57,600
♫ ♫

35
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,960
 ♫ The wind was silent ♫ 

36
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,320
Help me up. My stomach hurts.

37
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,420
I mean it.

38
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:12,170
♫ ♫

39
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:15,360
 ♫ You are silent ♫ 

40
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,000
 ♫ Even after all these years,
we can't see each other ♫ 

41
00:04:38,359 --> 00:04:40,080
Just get some rest.

42
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,100
 ♫ We'll say goodbye at any moment ♫ 

43
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,350
 ♫ And the words we didn't finish ♫ 

44
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:50,990
♫ ♫

45
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,439
You're burning up.

46
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:54,559
Maybe.

47
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:57,239
You drank this much while having a fever?

48
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,840
I'll get the doctor here.

49
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,540
I'm fine.

50
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,680
 ♫ Love is not our destiny ♫ 

51
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,220
 ♫ I asked the wind when you'd be back ♫ 

52
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:15,740
 ♫ You are silent ♫ 

53
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:19,820
 ♫ Even after all these years,
we can't see each other ♫ 

54
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,140
 ♫ I can only dazedly see you in the crowd ♫ 

55
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,179
Not mad now?

56
00:05:43,179 --> 00:05:45,599
It's my fault.

57
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,139
I shouldn't have pushed you.

58
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:49,640
So, what got you so mad?

59
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:56,650
If your fever doesn't break by the end of the night,

60
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:59,500
I'll take you to the hospital for a drip.

61
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,359
Fu Cheng.

62
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,480
What now?

63
00:06:15,239 --> 00:06:16,710
I'm hungry.

64
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:22,620
 ♫ You tell me you're not happy ♫ 

65
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,138
 ♫ It makes my heart ache deeply ♫ 

66
00:06:26,138 --> 00:06:31,047
 ♫ What can I do for you? Please, tell me ♫ 

67
00:06:31,047 --> 00:06:37,000
 ♫ I won't speak, but I know there's so much ♫ 

68
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,480
 ♫ You hesitate to tell me ♫ 

69
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:46,040
 ♫ Why are there tears in your eyes? ♫ 

70
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,756
 ♫ Everything I say seems wrong ♫ 

71
00:06:50,756 --> 00:06:54,430
 ♫ All I can do is listen, as you go on... ♫ 

72
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:59,970
♫ ♫

73
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:02,052
You want to have a taste too?

74
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,860
 ♫ Your tears hidden behind the mask, they dim ♫ 

75
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:11,960
 ♫ But you still love, even if it's not real ♫ 

76
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,420
So? Is it sweet?

77
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,019
It's bitter.

78
00:07:23,899 --> 00:07:26,040
 Very bitter. 

79
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,760
 Just like how I've been fooled, 

80
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,510
 stomped on, 

81
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:32,950
 and tempted 

82
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:35,450
 by you over and over, 

83
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:38,180
 it's unbearable. 

84
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,720
 ♫ The more I care, the more it aches ♫ 

85
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,460
 ♫ We all make mistakes, and that's how we learn ♫ 

86
00:07:53,460 --> 00:08:02,247
 ♫ Me staying quiet shows how much I yearn ♫ 

87
00:08:02,247 --> 00:08:06,780
 ♫ Your tears hidden behind the mask, they dim ♫ 

88
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,400
Sleep with me.

89
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,880
No.

90
00:08:11,679 --> 00:08:14,520
- Come on.
- No!

91
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,740
I'm sick. I need a hug.

92
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,100
 ♫ All right ♫ 

93
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,600
 ♫ I'm the silent third wheel in this game ♫ 

94
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,860
 ♫ How pathetic I appear ♫ 

95
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:31,000
 ♫ I love you, yet I remain silent ♫ 

96
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,410
Turn around.

97
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:50,700
♫ ♫

98
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:56,140
 ♫ Your happiness is the greatest comfort
to my heart ♫ 

99
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,500
 ♫ All right ♫ 

100
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:03,140
 ♫ I'm willing to break my wings for you ♫ 

101
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:10,960
 ♫ So that I won't fly in front of you ♫ 

102
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,399
Am I disturbing your rest?

103
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,759
Not happy to see me?

104
00:09:50,599 --> 00:09:52,879
Who did you think it was?

105
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:55,880
The bodyguard?

106
00:09:57,439 --> 00:09:59,459
Of course I'm happy to see you.
I feel surprised.

107
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:01,699
I didn't expect you to come so early.

108
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:08,100
What food did you bring?

109
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:14,679
I thought your stomach might hurt
from drinking a lot last night,

110
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:17,760
so I brought some breakfast
to help your digestion.

111
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:30,839
You've already eaten?

112
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,839
I just started to eat.

113
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:36,300
Looks like I got here in time.

114
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,739
I heard the Jiang family is competing
for the operating rights of the Xijiang Dock.

115
00:10:46,739 --> 00:10:50,739
My father has already spoken with the people
in charge of this matter,

116
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,520
so there shouldn't be any problems.

117
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,880
Thank you,

118
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,579
I'll be sure to visit your father with a nice gift
to show my gratitude.

119
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,859
We're family,
so there's no need to stand on ceremony.

120
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:10,880
In a couple of days, my cousin
is having her 18th birthday party.

121
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,180
Will you have time to join me?

122
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:16,000
I'll clear my schedule for that day.

123
00:11:20,319 --> 00:11:22,760
You did a great job with the Xijiang Dock.

124
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,880
Thanks to Dong Yang for his help.

125
00:11:25,699 --> 00:11:31,380
Dong Yang's father called me the other day,
and mentioned your engagement.

126
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,980
Mr. Shen thinks

127
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:38,840
it's been almost a year since you two got engaged,

128
00:11:38,842 --> 00:11:42,579
and he hopes you'll get married
by the end of this year.

129
00:11:50,199 --> 00:11:53,640
I know a bit about Dong Yang's situation,

130
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:58,000
but let's face it,
men are rarely without their flirtations.

131
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,120
However, once they settle down and get married,
they usually settle down.

132
00:12:07,719 --> 00:12:10,760
 If marriage alone could fix
a man's wandering heart, 

133
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,959
 then I wouldn't still be handling
the Jiang Ying Si case. 

134
00:12:13,959 --> 00:12:15,520
I understand.

135
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:19,520
Ying Xian, I know you the best.

136
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:24,120
You're not just clever and sharp,
but also composed and level-headed.

137
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:33,300
So you should know

138
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:39,920
exactly what matters most for both you and the Jiang's,

139
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:43,520
not like your elder brother.

140
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:48,320
Well, of course, you're always saying
that I'm the one most like you, right?

141
00:12:57,479 --> 00:13:03,590
If you were a boy, that would be great,

142
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:06,690
and life would be so much easier for me.

143
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,100
Come in.

144
00:13:19,719 --> 00:13:22,559
Boss, Mr. Shen sent this here.

145
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:26,280
It's a dress he picked for you
to attend the party.

146
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,000
Leave it here.

147
00:13:30,294 --> 00:13:32,540
How are things with Jiang Ying Si now?

148
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,859
Our men have gotten in touch with him secretly.

149
00:13:34,859 --> 00:13:39,319
If you don't mind,
we should be able to meet him soon.

150
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,520
Arrange for a meeting as soon as possible.

151
00:13:42,979 --> 00:13:45,920
Well, Fu Cheng took leave.

152
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,339
Maybe you can meet Jiang Ying Si after he's back?

153
00:13:48,339 --> 00:13:50,679
- In case there is any mishap.
- He took leave?

154
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:52,799
The hospital said Fu Zhi was awake,

155
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:56,719
so he needed to take care of his sister
for a few days, and see how she was doing.

156
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,439
I thought he was mad.

157
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:02,120
He was what?

158
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,920
Nothing.

159
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,160
No need to wait for him.

160
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,920
Just arrange for a meeting
with Jiang Ying Si for me soon.

161
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:11,579
Yes.

162
00:14:33,719 --> 00:14:37,360
Cheng, is something bothering you?

163
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,920
No.

164
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,000
Just get some rest.

165
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,920
I got to go now.

166
00:14:44,439 --> 00:14:47,760
Cheng, aren't you going to stay with me?

167
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,739
Just focus on your recovery.

168
00:14:52,739 --> 00:14:56,199
When you fully recover, I will take you home.

169
00:14:56,199 --> 00:15:00,999
Then, does it mean we can
go back to our old house soon?

170
00:15:04,719 --> 00:15:06,340
Uncle Fu,

171
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,830
I need details on Shen Dong Yang.

172
00:15:11,319 --> 00:15:14,360
After the marriage between
the Jiang and Shen families,

173
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,479
the Jiang family will undoubtedly
become even more unstoppable,

174
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,619
so we definitely need to pay attention
to the Shen family.

175
00:15:23,219 --> 00:15:27,479
 What exactly does this person
mean to Jiang Ying Xian? 

176
00:15:27,479 --> 00:15:29,920
 She's treating that person
as her own life and soul. 

177
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,079
- Miss Jiang.
- Miss Jiang.

178
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,160
Miss Jiang.

179
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,840
Miss Jiang.

180
00:15:48,867 --> 00:15:50,666
Looks this way, Miss Jiang.

181
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:52,585
Over here, please.

182
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:56,743
Another one here, please.

183
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:07,379
Miss Lu, happy birthday.
 

184
00:16:07,379 --> 00:16:11,179
Thank you, Ying Xian. You two carry on.
I'll go attend to the guests.

185
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,920
This qipao suits you very well.

186
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,040
Keep the occasion in mind.

187
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,640
My fiancée, you've been a bit distracted recently.

188
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,599
Let me help you make up your mind.

189
00:16:34,599 --> 00:16:36,419
Miss Jiang.

190
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,559
Miss Jiang.

191
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:51,360
This is what you asked me to get.

192
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:58,000
I forgot to tell you
that I told Fu Cheng to get it.

193
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,359
I only realized I forgot to bring it with me
when I arrived at the hotel.

194
00:17:02,199 --> 00:17:04,880
I planned to ask Ke Rui to help me get it,

195
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:11,360
but she told me that Mr. Fu
happened to be around here.

196
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,060
 ♫ What more do you want from me? ♫ 

197
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:19,700
 ♫ If it's not enough,
I'll fill it with persistence ♫ 

198
00:17:20,952 --> 00:17:23,780
 ♫ How do I describe your silhouette? ♫ 

199
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:28,640
 ♫ All you gave me was a love out of sync ♫ 

200
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,160
Do you like it?

201
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:35,180
 ♫ And finally torn apart ♫ 

202
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,860
 ♫ The fireworks cool the loneliness ♫ 

203
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:42,660
 ♫ Yet you ask me to keep safe ♫ 

204
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:46,800
 ♫ All my memories of you ♫ 

205
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,775
The moment I saw it,
I thought it'd look best on you.

206
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:55,560
Dong Yang, isn't this the limited edition
that just came out a few days ago?

207
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,060
You're really thoughtful!

208
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:00,380
 ♫ Excuses aren't lacking ♫ 

209
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:05,020
 ♫ But only those who've loved
have the right to remain silent ♫ 

210
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:09,220
 ♫ It's not that I talk endlessly
to push away your reluctance ♫ 

211
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:13,100
 ♫ It's just that I'm tired and hurt,
leaving nothing behind ♫ 

212
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:20,100
 ♫ Isn't it natural to want to keep loving
what you've had? ♫ 

213
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:30,000


214
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:37,420
 ♫ I don't want to hear
the shattered sounds of the past ♫ 

215
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:42,200
 ♫ My crumpled heart is now misshapen ♫ 

216
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:49,240
 ♫ It's the wind that rises,
taking my thoughts of you with it ♫ 

217
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:54,720
 ♫ And when the wind stops,
my longing doesn't cease ♫ 

218
00:18:55,800 --> 00:19:02,180
 ♫ So how do we write regret? ♫ 

219
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:08,400
 ♫ Is it the silent, lingering scenes? ♫ 

220
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:14,340
 ♫ Or is it the ending we tore apart ourselves? ♫ 

221
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:20,560
 ♫ Until emotions gradually wither and mature,
fading away ♫ 

222
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:23,260
 ♫ Regret is the maple forest in slumber ♫ 

223
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:26,900
 ♫ It's the heavy snow falling outside the window ♫ 

224
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:33,500
 ♫ It's the story that should have been yours
but has no ending ♫ 

225
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,260
 ♫ Turns out poets are used ♫ 

226
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:39,300
 ♫ To writing regret beautifully ♫ 

227
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,990
 ♫ The tears that spill ♫ 

228
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:42,450
 ♫ Soaking a page ♫ 

229
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:44,060
 ♫ I stare out the window ♫ 

230
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:48,420
 ♫ No longer searching for the right words ♫
