My subordinates are the ones who handle this,

I'm well aware.

315
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:49,030
It started as Beomyeong Foods in an impoverished country.

316
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:51,720
It grew to Beomyeong Construction with the development of the country

317
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,250
and fostered a construction boom.

318
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:55,530
And finally, it grew to Beomyeong Electronics once we became a developed country.

Beomyeong Electronics is lucky,

331
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:37,250
since you have Silver Lining with the world's best technology as your partner.

332
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,730
On the contrary,

333
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:40,850
Silver Lining is unlucky

334
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:43,330
since its partner, Beomyeong Electronics,

335
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:45,500
is bullheaded.

336
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:54,380
How old is President Kim this year?

337
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:57,760
He's forty-three years old.

338
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,440
A bastard younger than my child dares to...

339
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:11,290
That bastard with no class is trying to shake up my whole company.

340
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,350
Employment express, my foot.

341
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:27,250
More like a southbound train to my hometown.

342
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,770
I endured for ten years as a job seeker.

343
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:43,250
How could I not endure those ten minutes?

344
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:48,560
Wow, you folded quite a few.

345
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,010
Hold on.

346
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:54,800
Yes, Master—

347
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,200
I mean...

348
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,960
- Landlady, hello.
- Yes, hello.

349
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,160
You're aware your contract is about to expire, right?

350
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,860
Yes, I was going to call you about that anyway.

351
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:07,710
I'd like to renew it for another two years.

352
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,730
That's a shame.

353
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:12,970
I'd like for you to move out.

354
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:17,790
What are you saying?

355
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:18,870
The laws have changed,

356
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:20,900
so the tenant may stay for two more years if they wish to.

357
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:24,010
The law has indeed changed.

358
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:25,540
So if my immediate family says they want to move in,

359
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:28,280
you must move out.

360
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,760
Your immediate family?

361
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,830
Yes.

362
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:33,220
Keep that in mind.

363
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:38,490
Mom, I'm back from school!

364
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:40,350
Yes, my son, you're back.

365
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:41,610
Him?

366
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:43,320
He's going to live here alone?

367
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,470
That's right! My son.

368
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:48,640
He's at an age where he wants to move out of his parent's home and be independent.

369
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,870
- Independence? Am I Ahn Jung Geun, the freedom fighter?

370
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:53,010
Hurry and get in. You have to go to cram school!

371
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:55,260
Hold on!

372
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:03,740
It must be great for you

373
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:06,160
since your parents live in Seoul.

374
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:10,800
Ji Won, hurry and get inside!

375
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,660
Coming!

376
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:19,590
My gosh.

377
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,440
♫ I guess ♫

378
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:48,380
♫ I am still young ♫

379
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,640
♫ I must be ♫

380
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,700
♫ Mom! ♫

381
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:59,070
♫ Why do I keep waiting? ♫

382
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:01,070
♫ Mom! ♫

383
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:07,430
♫ Why do I suddenly miss you? ♫

384
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:13,590
♫ I guess I'm still young ♫

385
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,800
♫ I must be ♫

386
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,950
♫ Mom! ♫

387
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:24,200
♫ Why do I keep getting sad? ♫

388
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,310
♫ Mom! ♫

389
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:33,800
♫ Why do I suddenly want to cry? ♫

390
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:37,050
♫ I came to pick flowers ♫

391
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:40,530
♫ On a hill dyed in autumn ♫

392
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:42,190
♫ And fell asleep ♫

393
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:43,880
♫ I fell asleep ♫

394
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,820
♫ I fell asleep ♫

395
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:50,800
♫ Mom! ♫

396
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:56,910
♫ Where am I going? ♫

397
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:07,940
♫ When I'm lonely, I look at the sky ♫

398
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,660
Why are you so late today?

399
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:22,520
You should at least give me some time to stop by home.

400
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,040
I know you frequently go back and forth

401
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,780
while I'm at work.

402
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:30,200
Wh-When did I?

403
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,510
I pay you for those hours too.

404
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:38,110
I'm going to the convenience store.

405
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:05,700
What's the point of life-sustaining treatment?

406
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:06,900
She's just burdening her daughter.

407
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,640
Be quiet. She can hear you.

408
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,490
I want her to hear me.

409
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,720
I feel sorry for her.

410
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,290
She's got a life ahead of her.

411
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:17,770
She'll just waste it, nursing her mom.

412
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:23,450
If I wanted to get a job,

413
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:25,330
they said I needed experience.

414
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:26,900
But

415
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,440
you know what?

416
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:33,500
I need to get a job to gain that experience in the first place.

417
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,240
M-Me, too. Me, too.

418
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,090
I need to invest in stocks to earn money.

419
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:39,430
But hey!

420
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:41,500
I need money to invest in stocks.

421
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:46,870
They're just asking all poor job seekers to die.

422
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:48,070
Hey,

423
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:50,890
is Silver Lining the only company in South Korea?

424
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:53,180
It's okay, it's okay. You'll get another chance next time.

425
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:54,730
Of course, I will.

426
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:56,830
Of course, I will. But

427
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,480
the thing is...

428
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:05,160
I know I will be a mess until that next opportunity.

429
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,760
Why are you like this today?

430
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:10,260
It's not the first time you failed an interview.

431
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:14,630
Hyeon Ho, would the sting of a punch be any less if you get punched more often.

432
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:16,350
It still stings.

433
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,700
What happened with your house?

434
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,510
What did the realtor say?

435
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,200
Fifty million won?

436
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,250
That's right.

437
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:33,560
You need another 50 million won.

438
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,960
Not five but fifty—?

439
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,290
If you want a house like that, that's the market price.

440
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:39,930
- Where will I get a large sum like--
- I understand your situation,

441
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:41,500
but I recommend you hurry.

442
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,640
You're also aware, right?

443
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,640
That housing in Seoul is the cheapest today?

444
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,870
Call me later!

445
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:49,980
I lived my life giving it my all,

446
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:54,180
but I'll have an additional debt of 50 million won in just two years.

447
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:56,890
What have I done wrong?

448
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:59,030
Why must I be in debt?

449
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:05,030
Do you think it's that easy to get into debt?

450
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:08,370
What bank would lend money to a job seeker?

451
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:15,370
Forget it and just live with me.

452
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,850
You barely have enough room for you to sleep comfortably.

453
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:20,310
I appreciate your offer, though.

454
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,560
Then what will you do?

455
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,640
Will you pack up and go back to your hometown?

456
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,260
I really do want to go back to my hometown.

457
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,990
But

458
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,870
most of the companies are in Seoul.

459
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:34,050
What can I do?

460
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:39,730
Hey, if people like us

461
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:41,930
want to live in Seoul,

462
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:44,380
Seoul Detention Center is all that's left.

463
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,480
Excuse me,

464
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:51,650
Seoul Detention Center

465
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:55,490
is actually in Uiwang, Gyeonggi-do.

466
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:06,530
Gosh.

467
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:08,780
She's going to work.

468
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,520
No, coming back from work.

469
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,120
What a filial daughter.

470
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,710
Your interest is piling as we speak.

471
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:36,590
I'm paying you back.

472
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:38,770
When will you finish at that rate?

473
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:40,960
Your debt is fifty million.

474
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,410
If I were you,

475
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:45,400
I'd at least sell an organ of that living corpse.

476
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,910
Or if you don't like that,

477
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:01,360
you could sell something else.

478
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:12,040
Could you even sell me for an expensive price?

479
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,740
So what I'm saying is...

480
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:16,500
love your job and consider it

481
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,220
as something you were born to do.

482
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:21,210
Hyeongnim Ma Pi, hello.

483
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:24,290
Why am I your hyeongnim?

484
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,310
Where's Madam Jeong?

485
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:29,670
Yes, this way, please.

486
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:32,960
Baby, hello!

487
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,580
Hello, Oppa!

488
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,170
Hello.

489
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:39,180
You have a nice vibe, like a college student.

490
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:44,240
If you have fifty million won in debt, the house can pay that off.

491
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,800
With some touch-ups,

492
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:49,710
she might even bring in thirty million won per month.

493
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,530
Breast surgery is eight million won,

494
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,890
skin care will cost about one million won per month as well.

Suddenly, I couldn't hear him anymore.

660
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,760
I couldn't even tell him I bought sweet potatoes.

661
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,650
What's this suddenly?

662
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:20,610
There's absolutely no signal.

663
00:44:46,210 --> 00:44:48,110
It's delicious.

664
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:50,990
Of course.

665
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:54,220
Eat a lot.

666
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:00,460
Hey, hold it properly.

667
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:04,500
It's just that our son doesn't have any tricks up his sleeve,

668
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:07,010
but he's still good and kind.

669
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:11,820
That's why we named him In Seong*.
(*Inseong: a person's character)

670
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:13,520
A person's character comes first.

671
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,480
That's right.

672
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,350
Father, I have something to tell you.

673
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:22,160
My security deposit suddenly went up...

674
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:27,390
Couldn't you withdraw that deposit and come live down here?

675
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:30,620
Don't say pointless things.

676
00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:33,480
Why?

677
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,720
Did something happen?

678
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:44,490
Well, the thing is...

679
00:45:46,270 --> 00:45:49,950
You know what havoc the last typhoon wrecked.

680
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:51,910
I am thinking about doing the repairs and

681
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:54,880
plant that... what's it called... shine muscat?

682
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,560
You know, the green grapes. I'm thinking of getting into that,

683
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:59,810
but it costs quite a bit.

684
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:03,230
Are you going to use my deposit for that?

685
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:07,010
You did more than enough, and I think we waited long enough.

686
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:07,900
Even so—

687
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:11,050
If it did not work out until now, it would never work out.

688
00:46:11,050 --> 00:46:13,670
Aren't you going to be thirty soon?

689
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:16,980
You don't even have a proper job, gosh.

690
00:46:17,810 --> 00:46:20,410
Are you telling me to give up again?

691
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:22,230
In Seong.

692
00:46:22,230 --> 00:46:23,830
I even gave up on acting because you told me to give up on pipe dreams

693
00:46:23,830 --> 00:46:28,100
and live like other people.

694
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:29,690
Hey, you punk.

695
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:33,540
That was because you were wasting your time as a young guy!

696
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:36,370
What is he saying right now?

697
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:39,570
Gosh, In Seong's dad!

698
00:46:39,570 --> 00:46:42,190
Why is the door not opening?

699
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:53,130
What did I get to do, really?

700
00:46:53,130 --> 00:46:55,490
Two years in the army and four years in college.

701
00:46:55,490 --> 00:46:57,920
I even took a leave for two years to pay for the tuition.

702
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,150
I'm doing my best to make something out of myself,

703
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:03,920
but why do you only keep saying that it won't work? Why?

704
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:07,240
In Seong... In Seong!

705
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:09,320
Gosh, In Seong!

706
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:32,330
You should've at least finished eating before storming out.

707
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:40,580
What about Father?

708
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:43,330
He's having some soju.

709
00:47:43,330 --> 00:47:45,350
Shall we have some expensive drinks?

710
00:47:45,350 --> 00:47:47,140
Expensive drinks?

711
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:49,090
Ta-da!

712
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:56,400
I'm sure you're frustrated, but wouldn't he also be just as frustrated?

713
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:05,980
Your father was not like that before.

714
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:08,450
That's not true.

715
00:48:08,450 --> 00:48:11,220
He was always like that.

716
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:12,680
No, he wasn't.

717
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:16,920
That's because you saw him after he aged.

718
00:48:19,910 --> 00:48:21,640
Hey.

719
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:24,020
Do you think you're the only one who had a dream?

720
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:27,620
Your father also had a dream and passion.

721
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:29,450
But now,

722
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:35,470
time has weathered him down. He's only left with ill will.

723
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:46,670
Challenge?

724
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:49,450
A challenge is good.

725
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:53,670
But what if you fail?

726
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:59,810
Your father is just scared.

727
00:48:59,810 --> 00:49:04,910
He's afraid you'd fall and never get back up again.

728
00:49:06,330 --> 00:49:09,040
He wants to help you get back up.

729
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,450
But as parents,

730
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:15,450
he's afraid we might not have enough money to do that.

731
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:29,250
- Hey.
- Correct!

732
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:32,940
What's that on your face?

733
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:34,950
On my face?

734
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,950
It's a cloud!

735
00:49:37,950 --> 00:49:39,420
What?

736
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:42,200
The call cannot be connected. Your call will be forwarded

737
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:44,270
- to messaging and
- What's the answer? The ceiling!

738
00:49:44,270 --> 00:49:45,540
will be charged after the beep.

739
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:46,900
I guess so.

740
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:49,320
Now, then.

741
00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:55,310
What shall we do?

742
00:49:55,310 --> 00:49:58,250
There must be an emergency at the company.

743
00:49:59,610 --> 00:50:01,650
Are you really not going to eat?

744
00:50:01,650 --> 00:50:04,160
You could be in big trouble.

745
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,250
Do Yun, do you want a cookie?

746
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:08,450
Open wide.

747
00:50:08,450 --> 00:50:11,210
There you go, sweetheart.

748
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:13,330
Let's eat this!

749
00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:20,530
Dad will come for sure.

I didn't.

No.

769
00:51:59,070 --> 00:52:01,990
I had a sweet dream.

770
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:06,100
Then why do you cry so sadly?

771

Because

772
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:12,080
it's a dream that can't come true.

773
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:16,180
What was the dream about?

774
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:20,410
I was the president of a company.

775
00:52:20,410 --> 00:52:21,500
The president?

776
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:23,230
Hey, that's a good dream—

777
00:52:23,230 --> 00:52:27,130
Were you sleeping until now to have a dogsh*t dream like that?

778
00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:28,250
Goodness, Honey!

You should be grateful if you can become a minor employee.

But what now? The president?

781

00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:37,200
come to his senses.

Where the heck is that brat running off to?

785
00:52:41,650 --> 00:52:44,330
That place is infested with snakes.

Go and catch some snakes while you're there!

787

So I can make some liquor.

788

Why are they not contacting me?

What were you expecting when you made that mess out of the interview?

00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:30,890
What?

It's the outback again.

00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:42,980
I want to go to an amusement park.

Okay, let's go.

797

I guess the ox will do the harvesting itself.

798
00:53:51,650 --> 00:53:55,340
I'll make it so that Mom and Dad won't have to work.

799
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:56,470
How do you plan to do that?

800
00:53:56,470 --> 00:53:58,830
I'm going to grow up and become an actor.

801
00:53:58,830 --> 00:54:00,550
Then I'll make a lot of money.

802

Just wait and see.

803
00:54:03,550 --> 00:54:06,260
I don't need money.

804

I'll get you to take a picture with him too.

807

Gosh, not you too, Honey.

00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:17,800
Why do you keep getting his hopes up?

810
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:20,890
What's wrong with you, Honey? You're discouraging him.

No, it had no toxicity at all.

You were too shocked by the fact that you were bitten,
