It is predicted that 47% of existing jobs

An AI with superior intelligence and

36
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,600
even autonomy. If such AI appears,

37
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:53,000
it will pose a danger to not only the individual,

38

but the entire species of Homo sapiens.

39
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,940

00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:09,660
Yes.

170
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:13,560
I heard Dad's voice, though.

171
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:18,220
Oh, Uncle was talking to a friend on the phone.

172
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,730
Min Ah must've heard wrong.

173
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,310
Didn't you go to kindergarten today?

174
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:26,320
Today's Sunday.

175
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,340
I'll knock next time.

176
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:32,410
Min Ah, wait a minute.

177
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:34,220
Come here.

178
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:37,670
Let me tie your hair again.

179
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,740
All right, turn around.

180
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,580
Min Ah.

181
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,050
Do you want me to show you something cool?

182
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:55,200
What is it?

183
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:02,680
Actually, Uncle is a magician.

184
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,420
I'm serious. Here...

185
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:09,680
Abra...

186
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,840
cadabra...

187
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,390
there!

188
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,800
How did you do it?

189
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,300
Do you want to play with Uncle today?

190
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,030
Let's go!

191
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,140
What do you want to do?

192
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:34,860
Min Ah, go and bring one more book.

193
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:39,310
One, two, three, there!

194
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:43,160
- It's done!
- It's done!

195
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,120
It's done, it's done.

196
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,690
Min Ah, there you go!

197
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:49,440
I think it's taller than I am.

198
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:51,860
Which finger?

199
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:54,430
- This finger.
- Wrong.

200
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:56,140
One more time.

201
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,580
Which finger?

202
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:01,780
This one.

203
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,090
You got it.

204
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:04,370
Here's your food.

205
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,920
It looks delicious.

206
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:20,530
Min Ah, look at this.

207
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:22,500
What's this?

208
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,440
Do you want to see something funny?

209
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,870
Wow, it's a caterpillar.

210
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:27,250
I want to try, too.

211
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,430
Do you want to try, too?

212
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:31,650
Here.

213
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:37,380
Who taught you all of these things?

214
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:45,470
How is it? Cool, isn't it?

215
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:46,510
Right?

216
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:50,400
Baro, do you know any magic?

217
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:54,640
If there's a magic that will make you happy,

218
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,010
I definitely want to try learning it.

219
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:59,990
The things you say, seriously.

220
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,200
Baro...

221
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:17,060
My shoulder is about to give.

222
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,980
Aren't you going to do the weeding?

223
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,130
I said I'll go.

224
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,760
Do you want to come along and take a stroll?

225
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,110
It's about time for the drama.

226
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:33,390
Sure, you need to watch it.

227
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:35,030
The drama you watched yesterday and will watch tomorrow.

228
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,130
You need to watch it today, too.

229
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:49,750
Harry Porter, you're all I have, okay?

230
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,350
Dear Harry Porter...

231
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,400
I haven't seen that car around before.

232
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,110
Did the foreman get a new car?

233
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:28,060
The third Chungbuk Redevelopment Site.

234
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:30,380
You've arrived at your destination.

235
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,740
Exiting navigation.

236
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,420
[The third Chungbuk Redevelopment Site]

237
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:58,540
It means Director Kwak met the President and came here.

238
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,640
Why the heck would he?

239
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,280
What?

240
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,600
Oh Mi Ran?

241
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:29,100
I'm conflicted about whether to build an apartment complex or

242
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,420
a domed stadium on this land.

243
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:34,780
My dream is to build a domed stadium,

244
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,570
but the majority want to build an apartment complex,

245
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:39,980
so I'm being swayed.

246
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:44,200
What would you build if it were you, Secretary Jeong?

247
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:53,020
I don't think President Park would've sent you to survey the land.

248
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:55,920
You came to see me on your own, right?

249
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:03,550
President Park In Seong agreed to reside at President Kim Seon Ju's house.

250
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:07,510
Is that the reason why you came to see me?

251
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:08,940
Just that?

252
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,530
Excuse me?

253
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:16,450
"President Park has Kim Seon Ju's phone."

254
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:18,930
It should be at that level, at least.

255
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:25,560
I guess you're wavering like me, Se Yeon.

256
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:34,770
Someone wants to build an art gallery here too.

257
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:40,080
There's nothing better to dirty money than gaudy paintings.

258
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,640
An art gallery is so random.

259
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,330
Right?

260
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:56,160
I wonder whom.

261
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:00,000
The person Director Kwak came to meet.

262
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:16,350
Hyungnim and I built Beomyeong Construction on a desolate

263
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:19,390
land like this without anything at all,

264
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:22,140
raised Beomyeong Electronics, and

265
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:25,580
created Beomyeong Auto.

266
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:29,290
That's why I'm always thankful to my father.

267
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:33,180
The name Beomyeong comes from the "Beom" character in Oh Beom Geun

268
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,740
and

269
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,920
the "Yeong" is from my name, Oh Yeong Geun.

270
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:41,790
You're talking only about the past again.

271
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:44,020
A human who only has the past to boast about

272
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:46,770
is quite insignificant, right?

273
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:50,010
And what have you done to be looking to take that seat?

274
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:52,440
It's not what I have done,

275
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,350
but you should look at what I can do.

276
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:58,050
It's a piece of advice I dare give you, Vice Chairman.

277
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:01,340
What can a mere person like you do? Okay.

278
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:05,760
Let's say you became Chairman. If you happen to get married,

279
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:10,500
then Beomyeong wouldn't be owned by the Oh family anymore, but by the Kims or the Lees.

280
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:13,670
I'm going to protect Beomyeong.

281
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:15,940
That kind of obsolete way of thinking is

282
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:18,310
the reason why even the Vice Chairman position is too good for you, Uncle.

283
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,360
What did you say?

284
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:24,400
Until I get dirt in my eyes– Wh-What is this?*
(The phrase means if he's dead and buried)

285
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:29,520
Didn't I advise you to look at what I can do?

286
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,940
Y-You...

287
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,230
Geez, my eyes...

288
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:39,450
It was stuffy, wasn't it?

289
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,950
Wow...

290
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:48,960
but that seven-year-old's stamina is...

291
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,010
You should train her to become a national athlete.

292
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:54,980
Kim Yuna, Kim Yeon Kyeong... and Kim Min Ah.

293
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,140
Good work.

294
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:01,610
The time you spent playing with Min Ah today, count it as overtime–

295
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:03,670
What do you mean by playing with her?

296
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,790
I had too much on my mind, too.

297
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:08,370
It was fun.

298
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,260
Also,

299
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:13,180
what do you mean, "Good work"?

300
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:15,170
It's not even a "thank you."

301
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:19,210
Thank you.

302
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:26,460
A compliment and even a thank you.

303
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:30,740
They say when a person changes suddenly, he'll die soon.

304
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:35,760
Oh, no!

305
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,970
No!

306
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,580
P-President?

307
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,970
Shit...

308
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:45,830
President?

309
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:50,110
Do you think that will work?

310
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:53,450
Don't do that and go to Bumyoung Electronics'
service center tomorrow morning.

311
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:55,810
What if I miss the golden time doing that?

312
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:59,980
Golden time? It's not like a phone is a person.

313
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:03,750
If your phone's broken, you can buy a new one. You're a president, you know.

314
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:06,060
No, inside this...

I must... be with.

320
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:24,840
He must have his ex's pictures on there. Gosh, he's so pure-hearted.

321
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,090
Aigoo...

322
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,420
Geez.

323
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:32,810
Uncle, what's wrong?

324
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,650
Min Ah, I'm sorry.

325
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,950
I'm sorry.

326
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:48,540
I'm sorry.

Your phone has been fixed. Here you go, Sir.

495
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,870
President, are you okay?

496
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:34,010
Hey, Kim Seon Ju!

497
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:38,090
Kim Seon Ju, please respond.

498
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:41,090
Are you really dying from falling in the poop bucket?

499
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,480
Do people still fall into poop buckets?

500
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,640
Maybe he has poop poisoning.

501
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:53,210
In Seong...

502
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:57,460
If you make the same mistake one more time–

503
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:58,800
It's working!

504
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,660
Excuse me, did you hear me?

505
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:02,480
- My phone's working! It's working.
- Excuse me?

506
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,100
- It's working!
- Who am I talking to?

507
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,170
Hey–

508
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:08,730
Yesterday, I spoke out of line.

509
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:10,730
Did you get it fixed?

510
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,280
Yes.

511
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,770
It works fine.

512
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,640
I'm glad.

513
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,090
There's no time.

514
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:27,000
Things got very delayed because of you-know-whom.

515
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:32,900
I found something strange while reviewing the black box footage.

516
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:44,660
What's wrong with this?

517
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:48,830
I reviewed it many times, too, but there was nothing unusual...

518
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:51,060
Look at it again carefully.

519
00:37:55,790 --> 00:38:00,170
When I got out of the car, you see another one passing by, right?

520
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:06,910
What's weird is from here on.

521
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:12,740
The car coming from the other side right now...

522
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:17,000
Is this the same car?

523
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,400
Yes.

524
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:23,160
The car that passed by when I was meeting Director Kwak took a U-turn and came back.

525
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:30,240
If he was on the way to Seoul, it'd make sense for him to have gone already.

526
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,310
Following us?

527
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:40,390
He could've simply gotten lost or he could've been wandering.

528
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:43,300
That's why I'm going to confirm it.

529
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:50,620
First, I need to look up the license plate.

530
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:55,520
I'll do that!

531
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,100
You'll do that, In Seong?

532
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,450
Do you know a policeman?

533
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:03,270
I heard you got hired by a big company this time, In Seong.

534
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:05,050
Good job! I'm proud of you.

535
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:06,840
How did you know that?

536
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,970
I heard it from your father, of course.

537
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:12,580
You're a spy if you don't know that around here.

538
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:15,620
What's the name? It's Silver...

539
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:17,330
Town?

540
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,440
It's Silver Lining.

541
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,830
Silver Lining.

542
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:25,080
Oh, yes! The lining thing.

543
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:31,230
Anyhow, you're the pride of our neighborhood, so tell me if you need anything, okay?

544
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:33,900
- So I was going to...
- Yes.

545
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,530
ask you to...

546
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:37,440
- look up a license–
- Chief!

547
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,570
- Yes?
- We have a problem.

548
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:42,320
Why, now?

549
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,940
Did the foreman's dog run away or something?

550
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:48,300
No, it's not the dog.

551
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:51,420
It's the foreman's wife who ran away.

552
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:52,490
What now?

553
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:54,090
Shouldn't we track her phone or something–

554
00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:56,460
You'll cause a much bigger problem!

555
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:59,940
You can't be doing government work

556
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:04,930
with a rule of thumb and driven by personal emotions like that!

557
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:07,300
Will In Seong be able to do a good job?

558
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,270
In this day and age?

559
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:11,780
Asking a favor from someone you know is nonsense.

560
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:13,380
It'll be difficult, right?

561
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,940
By the way...

562
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:17,460
will we be able to do a good job?

563
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,900
It's all on you, Secretary Jeong.

564
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:24,030
You must be assertive, no matter what.

565
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:27,040
- Assertive.
- Assertive.

566
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,440
How may I help you, Ma'am?

567
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,080
I'm...

568
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:41,230
the person who has a yearly subscription here...

569
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:44,070
I'm his secretary.

570
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:47,590
Oh, is that so, Ma'am?

571
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:49,790
Please charge my phone.

572
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:51,700
All right.

573
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:54,030
No, wait!

574
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:55,550
Pardon?

575
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:03,590
Please charge it through the computer.

576
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:05,080
Okay.

577
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:08,790
[Pro's ball goes in the planned direction. Amateur's ball goes in the feared direction.]

578
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,210
Success.

579
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:28,460
Aigoo, you haven't come in a long time. Stay a bit longer.

580
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:30,610
No, it's okay. You're probably busy.

581
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:32,300
Thank you for the coffee.

582
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,930
Okay.

583
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:37,140
Wait, is this your car?

584
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:38,910
It's a company car.

585
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:42,150
It's a nice car.

586
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:44,840
If you get hired a second time,

587
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,660
you might come on a helicopter next time.

588
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:54,280
Aigoo, you should've driven carefully in a new car.

589
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:57,630
Where did you get this dent?

590
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:00,970
Looks like it's only been a few days.

591
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:02,670
Ready...

592
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:04,500
action!

593
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:07,510
It was a hit-and-run.

594
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:08,770
Wh-What?

595
00:42:08,770 --> 00:42:10,300
That piece of shit!

596
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:12,220
Did you even report it?

597
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:13,930
I'm a new employee, so...

598
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:16,320
I was afraid of it becoming a big deal.

599
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,680
I'm just going to put it on myself.

600
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:22,280
Are you talking out of your mouth or your ass?

601
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:24,500
If something like this happened,

602
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,970
you should've told me right then!

603
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:31,490
- Aigoo... If I know the license number, I could immediately–
- Oh, I know the number.

604
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:33,200
Really?

605
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:38,370
I think it was... caught on the black box or something.

606
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,530
What's this?

607
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:44,610
Are you going to cook a stew with that number?

608
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:46,330
Tell me the number already.

609
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:48,060
Nice!

610
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:51,460
So... the car that hit me was...

611
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:53,890
It's a stolen car?

612
00:42:53,890 --> 00:42:56,600
Yes. We did a plate search, but...

613
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,880
there was no registered information.

614
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,610
A stolen car?

615
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:03,960
I knew it, but they're not to be underestimated.

616
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:06,640
[Chungbuk Campgrounds: 5km]

617
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,540
What about a tail? Were you really being followed?

618
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:11,210
I went into the golf course's server and

619
00:43:11,210 --> 00:43:14,810
checked the CCTV, entrance, and exit records.

620
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:19,610
After my car went in, "4885" followed me after one minute.

621
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:25,120
Right after my car left, "4885" also came out.

622
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,910
You were indeed followed...

623
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:28,790
but it's a stolen car.

624
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:32,970
So it's another dead end.

625
00:43:32,970 --> 00:43:36,640
Let's visit the accident site since we're here.

626
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:39,920
Okay.

627
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:48,640
It's this mountain.

628
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:03,540
No way.

629
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:06,120
- Are you saying you climbed here?
- Wow...

630
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:09,560
No way. Are you telling me to climb here?

631
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:15,290
Right. It's a course of movement that doesn't...

632
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:17,520
make sense unless my life was threatened.

633
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,730
Now... let's go.

634
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:19,440
It was around here... that I picked up the president's phone.

635
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,510
Here?

636
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:26,670
They probably immediately removed the remaining clues or traces.

637
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:30,260
Even so... since we came here,

638
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:32,090
one thing is certain now.

639
00:45:32,090 --> 00:45:35,820
That your stamina is crappy, In Seong?

640
00:45:37,330 --> 00:45:41,620
If someone really... tried to harm you here,

641
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:45,480
President Kim, it couldn't have been done by one person.

642
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:46,910
Why is that?

643
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:48,940
It's your body.

644
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:50,790
They

645
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:53,250
absolutely can't

646
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,310
bring you down

647
00:45:55,310 --> 00:45:57,750
all by themself on this path.

648
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:59,710
It's a convincing analysis.

649
00:45:59,710 --> 00:46:03,550
My height is indeed in at least the top three percent of Korea.

650
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:08,800
Hide.

651
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:13,110
The culprit always

652
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:14,950
revisits the

653
00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:17,580
crime scene without fail.

Mom.

655
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:36,840
Father.

656
00:46:50,490 --> 00:46:54,260
Why is he always calling the home phone when there's a cell phone?

657
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,930
Oh, this?

658
00:46:56,930 --> 00:47:00,040
In Seong was in a movie when he was young.

659
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:04,000
I need to replace the glass because it's broken.

660
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:06,950
So you're saying...

661
00:47:07,610 --> 00:47:10,080
you came for a business trip and stopped by?

662
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:11,730
Yes.

663
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,600
And you two are...

664
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,350
coworkers?

665
00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:18,530
Yes. She's my supervisor.

666
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:22,880
Is she your immediate boss?

667
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,830
Aigoo...

668
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:29,020
In Seong probably lacks a lot of things.

669
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:30,670
Yes.

670
00:47:30,670 --> 00:47:32,090
It's all ready!

671
00:47:32,090 --> 00:47:35,890
He's a good guy, though, if you pay attention to him.

672
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:37,790
I said it's ready. Hurry and come eat.

673
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:39,370
O-Okay.

674
00:47:39,370 --> 00:47:41,080
Let's go.

675
00:47:49,290 --> 00:47:51,570
All right.

676
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:52,670
Aigoo.

677
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:56,950
You probably know, but cassia seed tea is good for your eyes.

678
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:00,010
Gosh, we have a guest over,

679
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:03,340
but there's not a single meat dish! What's this?

680
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:05,390
The stores in town closed earlier.

681
00:48:05,390 --> 00:48:07,230
Is that so?

682
00:48:07,230 --> 00:48:11,110
If you were going to come, you should've let us know.

683
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:15,720
I wasn't going to come, so how could I let you know?

684
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:20,080
I'm sorry. I didn't know you were coming.

685
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:23,960
We usually mix up the side dishes we have with rice.

686
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:25,140
It's okay, right?

687
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:27,040
Yes.

688
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,550
Here's the pot.

689
00:48:29,550 --> 00:48:32,590
Even if I pack him side dishes,

690
00:48:32,590 --> 00:48:34,490
In Seong lets them sit in the fridge.

691
00:48:34,490 --> 00:48:35,660
He's really...

692
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:37,880
Don't pack him anything!

693
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:42,320
Aigoo, even so, he's working hard out there alone.

694

[Hotel Management]

695
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:51,950
Se Yeon, I'm home.

696
00:48:51,950 --> 00:48:53,760
- Mom, you're home.
- Yes.

697
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:04,090
How come you don't eat the side dishes I send you?

698
00:49:04,090 --> 00:49:07,270
This won't do. Let's just mix them up before they go bad, okay?

699
00:49:07,270 --> 00:49:08,870
Bibimbap?

700
00:49:08,870 --> 00:49:10,280
It's going to be delicious.

701
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,890
It's organic.

702
00:49:11,890 --> 00:49:14,030
- Eat all of it, okay?
- Okay.

703
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:18,270
Oh, my!

704
00:49:18,850 --> 00:49:20,070
It's tasty!

705
00:49:20,070 --> 00:49:23,490
Mom, you'll make me kimchi even after I get married, right?

706
00:49:23,490 --> 00:49:26,390
You said you'd live with me, but I guess you'll get married?

707
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:27,740
Of course.

708
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:30,350
There are so many guys who are head over heels for me in my department.

709
00:49:30,350 --> 00:49:33,040
- Aigoo, is that so?
- Yes.

710
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:35,170
I'll make sure to check with my two eyes

711
00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:37,690
just how great a guy you bring to the wedding.

712
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:39,850
Okay, Mother.

713
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:44,140
It's delicious.

714
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:47,060
It's because I mixed it.

715
00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:50,460
Hey, this...

716
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:52,380
Thank you for the food.

717
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,440
Okay.

718
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,680
Is something wrong?

719
00:50:11,090 --> 00:50:12,790
Aigoo, it looks amazing.

720
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:14,760
The sesame oil is so...

721
00:50:24,830 --> 00:50:26,610
My son is handsome every time I see him.

722
00:50:26,610 --> 00:50:28,910
Come on, Mom.

723
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,230
I'll get going, then.

724
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:35,450
We even cleaned up the other room. Why are you saying you'll leave?

725
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:39,630
We have to go up now to go to work tomorrow.

726
00:50:39,630 --> 00:50:43,960
He's just saying that out of disappointment.

727
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:46,760
Make sure you get home safe, okay?

728
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:48,560
Thank you.

729
00:50:52,190 --> 00:50:54,040
Excuse me.

There...

731
00:50:55,730 --> 00:50:57,270
there.

732
00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:00,640
- We'll get going. Go inside.
- Okay.

733
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:05,550
Bye, now.

00:51:05,550 --> 00:51:07,220
Get home safely.

00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:09,090
- Drive safely.
- Go on now.

Bye.

737
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:18,980
Aigoo.

738
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:29,940
Isn't she the first woman he brought home?

739
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:34,190
I need to know her time of birth to get a compatibility reading done.

740
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:49,100
Hey, Se Yeon...

741
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:53,000
Thank you... for the bibimbap.

742
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:55,260
It's delicious, right?

743
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:57,210
You know, I don't like bibimbap.

744
00:51:57,210 --> 00:51:59,440
Mixing rice or putting it in soup...

745
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,780
It's not to my liking.

746
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:03,020
Okay.

747
00:52:04,230 --> 00:52:06,910
Instead, I do like gambas.

748
00:52:06,910 --> 00:52:10,200
Let's have some together later for sure.

749
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:11,840
Okay.

750
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:15,720
For that to happen, we'd need to catch "4885" first.

751
00:52:16,790 --> 00:52:19,170
We came all the way here, but

752
00:52:20,550 --> 00:52:23,160
we're back at square one, right?

753
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:25,060
It's not square one

754
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:28,090
because we know for certain that

755
00:52:28,090 --> 00:52:30,030
the stolen car followed me.

756
00:52:30,030 --> 00:52:31,570
Wait a minute.

757
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:35,060
It followed you?

758
00:52:37,710 --> 00:52:39,710
If it followed you, President Kim...

759
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:43,830
couldn't they be following us even now?

00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:06,150
I'll head out there into the parking lot.

762
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:08,120
Will they really follow us?

763
00:53:17,950 --> 00:53:19,250
It's that car!

764
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:21,270
I'll confirm it.

765
00:53:21,270 --> 00:53:23,420
What are you going to do alone?

766
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:26,530
- Let's just head back for today–
- No.

767
00:53:26,530 --> 00:53:28,670
What if they realize that they were found out and

768
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:30,430
change the car?

769
00:53:30,430 --> 00:53:32,500
Or give up on following us?

770
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:37,670
Right now is the only chance.

771

You know something you shouldn't.

what are you going to do about this?

Are you going to call insurance?

How are you going to compensate for this?

- Are you laughing?
- What's up with this crazy f*cker?

827
00:57:48,010 --> 00:57:49,470
Hey.

828
00:57:49,890 --> 00:57:51,410
Get out of the way.

♫ If it gets out of line even a little, bang ♫

830
00:57:54,820 --> 00:57:56,500
Who sent you?

831
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:57,900
That's usually my line.

832
00:57:57,900 --> 00:57:59,390
What?

833
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:01,630
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

834
00:58:01,630 --> 00:58:03,250
I asked first.

835
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:05,580
♫ Don't get confused, I'm different today ♫

836
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:07,820
I'm that bitch's creditor.

- I need to be paid to leave.

839
00:58:14,530 --> 00:58:16,070
If you take her,

840
00:58:16,070 --> 00:58:17,900
who will I get the money from?

841
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:20,300
You can give me the money. Then I'll leave.

Is that so?

845
00:58:28,350 --> 00:58:31,930
Everyone has a sound plan...

00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:35,160
until they get f*cking beat up.

847
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:36,910
What shall we do?

848
00:58:36,910 --> 00:58:38,990
What do you mean? We'll bury them all.

849
