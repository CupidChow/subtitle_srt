Hey, let go. Let go.

167
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:58,670
This is a hospital. Please talk it out.

168
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:01,800
Talk it out, please!

169
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,330
I'm the president of Silver Lining.

170
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:13,800
Ready,

171
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,480
action!

172
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,830
What brings you here?

173
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:21,710
You're the one, right?

174
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:23,450
You're the one

175
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:28,350
who kidnapped President Kim Seon Ju.

176
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:35,770
- Do you have proof?
- Proof?

177
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:37,680
Why would I be the one to look for proof?

178
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,200
The video of him in room 301 with a respirator,

179
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,430
I plan to send it to the police.

180
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,040
The moment you do that,

181
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:50,700
the respirator will be taken off.

182
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,750
Think carefully about whether to turn me into

183
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:03,230
a kidnapper or a murderer.

184
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:23,130
Did you just come back?

185
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:24,980
Yes.

186
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:29,830
They're probably taken aback and scared as well because their hideout was exposed.

187
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,770
If we provoke them more from here,

188
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:35,510
they might act illogically.

189
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:38,430
We will have to move quietly on our own.

190
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:41,480
Yes. You also came back empty-handed, right?

191
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,100
Nope.

192
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:57,510
How did you get this?

193
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:59,780
This is a hospital. Please talk it out.

194
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,510
Talk it out, please!

195
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,260
What's the matter with this guy?

196
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:05,070
Hey, get him off!

197
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:11,110
I'm going to make a scene. Do your job without spacing out.

198
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,060
Please quit this now.

199
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,880
Stop this already

200
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,610
What's with this guy, seriously? What are you doing?

201
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:21,280
What are you doing?

202
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,450
- I said to let go!
- Take him out already!

203
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:25,790
This is chilling.

204
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,560
But don't worry

205
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,480
because the hand is faster than the eye.

206
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,400
Is it something like that?

207
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:35,640
You have the talent.

208
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:40,240
Had you known sooner, you would've paid me back faster.

209
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,550
Even if that's the case, how did you think of this?

210
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:48,680
We don't need to abide by the law against those who tossed it to the dogs, do we?

211
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:52,680
Se Yeon, I didn't think of you like that, but you're such a scary person.

212
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:56,220
It's not that she's scary. She's smart.

213
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,590
Wow.

214
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:06,890
If you don't need it, you can stay out, In Seong. I'll heist this doctor myself.

215
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:10,510
He's sure to have a link with Beomyeong.

216
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:12,410
Of course, I need it.

217
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:16,140
Se Yeon, your wisdom is as bright as neon.

218
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,100
A call.

219
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,200
Hello?

220
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,520
Mom said so?

221
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,470
Yes. She said to bring you right away.

222
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:38,650
Gosh, I'm busy nowadays.

223
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:40,810
By the way, what's the occasion?

224
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:42,460
I wouldn't know that, either.

225
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,320
But if she's asking me,

226
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,930
it'd be an important matter, wouldn't it?

227
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:51,690
I'm not in a situation where I can decide my own schedule.

228
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:54,150
Then who decides?

229
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,550
Oh, geez! Wow!

230
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:00,340
What's this? Why did it just do that on its own?

231
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,440
I-I had set it to play at this time.

232
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,400
"When you leave, tired of me,"

233
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,230
"I shall gently let you go without protest."

234
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:10,790
"Gently let you go?"

235
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,300
Let's go.

236
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:16,690
But in fact,

237
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:20,530
it's an irony because she deeply desires for you not to go.

238
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:22,290
H-Hey!

239
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:23,240
What's wrong?

240
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,540
Because he can't tread gently on them.

241
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:28,900
- The azaleas.
- Is he telling me to go or not?

242
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:31,770
Why are you doing this to me?

243
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,110
I wasn't saying it to you. You should've put your seatbelt on.

244
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,530
Okay.

245
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:41,010
- I'll go now, okay?
- Go.

246
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:42,760
This, seriously.

247
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,400
Gosh.

248
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:48,480
Why did she write this poem?

249
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:54,660
If you think about it, she was accepting that he'll have to leave her.

250
00:21:56,330 --> 00:22:00,010
Wow... It's the same, isn't it?

251
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:02,650
- It's been a long time, right?
- Yes, yes.

252
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:04,960
Hey, that house is still there, isn't it?

253
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,460
Of course. A house doesn't have legs.

254
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,190
The ahjussi in that house really hated me.

255
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:11,950
Where do you think you're going with your shoes on? You'll jinx it!

256
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:13,180
Hurry and come down!

257
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:15,330
Just come down!

258
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,820
You knew, didn't you, Hyung?

259
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:21,450
N-No, I didn't. I didn't know!

260
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:22,470
In Seong!

261
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:23,700
- Hyeon Ho!
- O-Oh, Mother!

262
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:26,450
- Long time no see!
- Mother!

263
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:28,780
Thank you, Hyeon Ho, for persuading In Seong to come.

264
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,510
Not a problem.

265
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:32,610
I guess I'll sit back and enjoy the show.

266
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:35,700
I'm glad you came! I'm so glad!

267
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,730
What's going on over here?

268
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:41,730
She said just a talisman wouldn't cut it because a ghost with three years of misfortune has tied itself to you.

269
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,320
Let's do just one exorcism.

270
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,190
Mom, I'm busy. Sorry.

271
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:47,900
I-In Seong! In Seong!

272
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,890
Had I known this, I wouldn't have come.

273
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:59,110
Let's hurry back to Seoul and—

274
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:01,230
- Let's try it.
- Sorry?

275
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:03,170
I mean, we came all the way here.

276
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:04,920
So let's give it a go.

277
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,930
Are you serious?

278
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:10,610
Let's do this!

279
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,980
Leave him this moment!

280
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:10,060
How bad of a grudge do you have to be haunting him this badly?

281
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,700
Shoo, shoo!

282
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,910
The spirit, who was betrayed by someone!

283
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:16,470
It's wandering the nine celestial bodies.

284
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:18,890
Leave him this moment!

285
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:23,000
To the place where your body lies, go back there!

286
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,900
Go back there!

287
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,700
Wh-What's wrong?

288
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,250
This one isn't a normal ghost.

289
00:24:56,250 --> 00:25:01,820
One mistake and your son could end up dying early because of this bitter spirit!

290
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,430
What?

291
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:09,320
What?

292
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:13,950
He'll die?

293
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:16,100
What do we do then?

294
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:19,340
You need to get a talisman.

295
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,580
O-Okay. How much is it?

296
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:25,400
Come on now! Is money the issue here?

297
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:27,640
No.

298
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,380
Please wait one second. Please wait.

299
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,930
Mom!

300
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:52,510
In Seong's mom, have you gone mad?

301
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:55,710
Our child might die.

302
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:58,650
Our child might die!

303
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:07,380
Why do I have heartburn?

304
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:11,000
Hey, don't we have a smaller one?

305
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:14,380
Now, where did I put it?

306
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:20,200
Gosh, just give me any of them. I could stick whatever on it, and they wouldn't know.

307
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:25,330
- Okay.
- Still,

308
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:28,880
isn't five million won too much for one talisman?

309
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,150
Hey, you need to row when the tide is coming in.

310
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:34,300
Understand?

311
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:41,320
Shit, should I have just asked for like ten million won while I'm at it?

312
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:44,160
Does it make you that happy?

313
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,970
- Hey.
- What?

314
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:47,870
Did you say that?

315
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:49,640
It wasn't me.

316
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:55,380
Then who is it? It's just the two of us here.

317
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:59,890
Why would it be just you two? I'm also here.

318
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:01,390
Did you see that?

319
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:03,930
Did you see that?

320
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:06,310
- The phone's working on its own.
- I know everything.

321
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:08,100
I'm watching everything.

322
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,460
I'm aware of everything!

323
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,570
I'm watching everything!

324
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:13,980
G-Gosh, it's hot!

325
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,400
Wow.

326
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,810
Are you okay?

327
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:18,940
I almost got a burn.

328
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,950
What's the matter?

329
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:24,500
Hey, it's really...

330
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:28,200
a g-ghost in this phone, isn't it?

331
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,730
My goodness.

332
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:31,640
There are no ghosts in this world!

333
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,940
- There's one right here!
- Whoa!

334
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,690
What?

335
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:38,970
I'm a ghost.

336
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:40,600
- The most evil...
- Whoa...

337
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,300
- spiteful spirit!
- H-Hey, the p-phone may burst!

338
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,730
R-Run away!

339
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:47,960
Hey, wait!

340
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,630
- Shit!
- Gosh.

341
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,640
As you said, that bastard is the hospital director.

342
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,390
It's weird.

343
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:09,080
What is?

344
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,900
This is an article from 2012.

345
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:15,850
Ha, an anesthesiologist who was sued for allegations of negligent death.

346
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:19,710
That makes him 34 years old in 2012 since this is his age at the time.

347
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:21,590
That means

348
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:24,100
he was born in 1978.

349
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:28,290
Surname Ha, anesthesiology, and born in 1978.

350
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:31,800
I think the doctor in this article is Ha Jong Baek.

351
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:38,940
What kind of a connection does he have? Is he working as a hospital director after killing a patient?

352
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,830
Seriously.

353
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:45,700
On top of that, the one who died from that medical malpractice is

354
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:49,700
Oh Seung Won, the only son of Beomyeong's Chairman Oh Beom Geun.

355
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:54,620
[Oh Seung Won]

356
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:03,160
It'd be so nice to have your bean-paste soup, but

357
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,480
In Seong is busy.

358
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:09,730
H-Hey, H-Hyeon Ho.

359
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:15,240
Aren't you coming? I'll go alone.

360
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:18,070
Mother, please don't be too worried.

361
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:20,680
- Get home safe.
- Okay.

362
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:28,180
Hey, say bye to her properly.

363
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,770
Hurry.

364
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:41,930
Mom.

365
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,700
I'm sorry.

366
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:51,730
Don't believe in superstitions anymore.

367
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:56,090
If anything, why don't you try going to church again?

368
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,960
I'll get going.

369
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,270
Take care.

370
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:09,480
Mother, I'll come back soon with In Seong!

371
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,350
O-Okay.

372
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,660
I hadn't seen Mother in a long time. Gosh, I should've had her bean-paste soup!

373
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:55,250
Gosh... this tells your mom's love for you.

374
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:03,650
So this is a talisman worth five million won, right?

375
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:09,010
Exorcisms and talismans in this day and age,

376
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:11,470
what's all this ruckus for?

377
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:15,000
Hey, if I were a really skillful shaman, I wouldn't tell others' fortunes.

378
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,700
I need to tell my own stocks.

379
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:24,010
Dear gods of Heaven and Earth, I pray to thee. Which stock is going to soar?

380
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:29,150
Whenever Mom does that every once in a while, my inside seriously turns upside down.

381
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:31,310
I just can't understand.

382
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,990
I can understand, though.

383
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:40,480
You said this back then after drinking. Your mom started believing in superstition all because of you.

384
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:45,790
It must've been his first time in front of a camera, but he did well. He is smart.

385
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:47,300
Thank you, Sir. We're grateful.

386
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,380
We need to treat you to something.

387
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,830
Would you like some snake wine made with snakes from the mountain over there?

388
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:54,200
Gosh, In Seong's dad!

389
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,430
Everyone is waiting, so...

390
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:58,700
- I'll contact you when the release date is set.
- Okay.

391
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,760
- Y-You know our phone number, right?
- Yes, I do.

392
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,330
- I told him.
- Oh, okay.

393
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:04,540
- Please take care.
- Thank you! Okay.

394
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,130
Please take care.

395
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:07,620
My dear star!

396
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,940
My son!

397
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:13,350
You became a movie star!

398
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:18,490
What did I say? In my dream last night, a crane was dancing on a clear river.

399
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:20,780
Mom, is that a good dream?

400
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:22,390
Of course!

401
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:24,990
That's what you call a lucky dream.

402
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:26,410
That's right!

403
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:29,680
Thanks to Mom, you got to appear in a movie, In Seong.

404
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,030
You're a movie star now!

405
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:36,980
- Gosh, I knew it.
- What a thing to happen.

406
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,860
Unni, you're really something.

407
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:41,500
Nowadays, if you tell your daughter-in-law to do something,

408
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,530
- you'll get kicked out instead.
- You're right.

409
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:45,160
- You're right.
- Mom!

410
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,330
Mom, I got accepted!

411
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:49,600
- Accepted!
- You got accepted?

412
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,050
Accepted for what?

413
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:53,650
- Oh, my, Son! You got accepted?
- Yes, I did!

414
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:56,140
- Hello.
- What do you mean?

415
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,890
- Where did you get accepted?
- Well,

416
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:01,800
i-it's for the main role of an independent film.

417
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,710
- The main role?
- Congrats!

418
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:07,890
But, hey, if it's an independence film,

419
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:09,720
are you acting as Kim Goo*?
(A Korean independence movement leader during Japanese colonial period)

420
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,860
My goodness. He's Kim Goo!

421
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:16,290
Oh, my. Oh, my. That's really a big deal, isn't it?

422
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:19,580
It's not that "independence"...

423
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,400
A-Anyway!

424
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,640
I'll be filming in Jeju-do starting next month.

425
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,510
- Oh, my goodness!
- Gosh!

426
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:28,700
It was real!

427
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:29,880
What was?

428
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,000
I told you!

429
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,830
In your new year fortune, there will be luck coming up

430
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:38,040
from the south after the first day of spring for you.

431
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:41,360
That's true! What you said was right, Mom.

432
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,550
Congratulations!

433
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:44,990
- Thank you.
- Congratulations, seriously.

434
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:48,460
I knew you'd be something big because you're handsome!

435
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:51,880
- Thank you. I'll get changed and help you.
- Go on, okay.

436
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,550
What a celebration this is!

437
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:58,100
So is In Seong becoming a movie star now?

438
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,730
Not yet.

439
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:03,670
Look here, look here. That shaman makes really good reads.

440
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:05,600
Where's the place? Introduce me, too!

441
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,510
Isn't it that woman down by the four-way over there?

442
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:10,130
No, Unni. That one is a fraud.

443
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:11,840
- This one is behind that one.
- Behind?

444
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,250
- Yes.
- Let's go together.

445
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:15,270
Gosh.

446
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:17,460
I would get hooked, too, if I were in her shoes.

447
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,000
Yes.

448
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,900
There's a thing called the placebo effect, too.

449
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:23,410
The mind is everything.

450
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:27,800
If you can obtain inner peace with this mere piece of paper,

451
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,760
would that still be a loss for her?

452
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:35,860
That's true.

453
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:38,760
Even so, five million won was too much!

454
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,840
Gosh, in their less-than-ideal circumstances...

455
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,760
And yet,

456
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:48,600
it's your mother's love.

457
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:02,080
You idiot!

458
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,880
Gosh, seriously.

459
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:26,280
H-Hey... how did it go?

460
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,540
What do you think they would've said?

461
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:32,600
Of course, they said all payments are final, and they'll never give a refund.

462
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,920
Gosh, those scoundrels.

463
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:37,520
I'm sorry.

464
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,320
We need to buy compost, and there are a bunch of expenses to cover.

465
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,750
That's why would you—

466
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:46,660
Come on, square your shoulders.

467
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:52,520
You didn't do anything wrong.

468
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,920
The ones who scammed a parent's heart are the sinners.

469
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:57,730
Why would a parent worry about their child being a sinner?

470
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:10,770
I said square your shoulders.

471
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,090
It's okay, my dear.

472
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:23,800
- I'm sorry.
- Come now.

473
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,380
It's okay.

474
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,380
Hey, tomorrow is...

475
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:34,180
I know. Pick up President Park at eight o'clock.

476
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:38,020
This is a little unfamiliar.

477
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:40,640
They say a person may die if they change too suddenly.

478
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,270
Why are you so cooperative these days?

479
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:47,220
You're an orphan, right?

480
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:50,140
I'm also an orphan.

481
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,600
It's pitiful.

482
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:55,490
If that kid also becomes an orphan, then life will feel like shit.

483
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:19,260
Excuse me!

484
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,910
Where did Patient Lee Jeong Yeon who was here go?

485
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:23,310
I'm not her attending nurse.

486
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:50,390
Gosh.

487
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:56,750
I'm sorry about today.

488
00:37:56,750 --> 00:38:00,740
You had to go through an unnecessary ordeal because of me.

Not at all.

"Could it really be that my soul... got trapped in a phone?"

"If I open my eyes again,"

494
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:20,410
"would I be going back to my body?"

495

It's also a fact that I had those false hopes.

497

A so-called IT corporation's president

498
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:35,260

502
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:56,480
To be honest, I read that report already when we were sneaking it out of the Vice Chairman's office.

503
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,160
According to the report, Baro 4.0 is

504
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,530
a failure.

505
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:03,400
That's true.

506
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,780
I found out that the AI had an error

507
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:11,500
where it makes its own decision, ignoring the user's will.

508
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:53,920
Baro! How can you make an illegal U-turn?

509
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:58,200
This place is a test-driving road, so there are no vigilance cameras.

510
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:01,120
Even when the developer didn't allow illegal U-turns,

511
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,330
the AI, as a result of deep learning,

512
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:06,670
became convinced that there is a better route to the destination

513
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:09,790
and acted with a sense of its own cognition.

514
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:18,930
Is it possible that the AI started having emotions?

515
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:25,520
Well, some people can look at it that way. But, to me, the developer, it's just a mistake.

It's only a critical bug.

Honestly, I don't know.

That's why he didn't keep his promise to me, either.

The President Kim that I have gotten to know

you would've notified both of them about the failure.

In that case, notifying Beomyeong Electronics would've been more difficult.

The Executive Director Oh, no— Mi Ran that I know

Wouldn't that be the reason

why you tried to deliver that report through Director Kwak?

537

President Park In Seong found President Kim Seon Ju's body, apparently.

As if you knew about it already.

But unfortunately, there was an accident during delivery.

655
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:10,790
Because Director Kwak got an axe to grind.

What makes you think that?

657
00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:21,470
If it was properly delivered back then, you would've also known about the failure of the self-driving car.

658
00:52:21,470 --> 00:52:27,060
In that case, there's no way for you to just sit and watch Executive Director Oh bluffing her way, like now.

Yes.

663

That's why you, Vice Chairman, found out for the first time about that report after Director Kwak died.

664
00:52:49,330 --> 00:52:54,010
This was found in the deceased Kwak Sam Su's car. He had it hidden quite deeply.
