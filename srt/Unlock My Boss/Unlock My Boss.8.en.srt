- Well, you know...

It'd be a piece of toilet paper, not a lock, if it opened easily.

Can't you just put it somewhere, like under his pillow?

I was envious of President Kim

00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:53,500
because I was always the one who had to be chosen.

"how great would it be if I also had a choice?"

217
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:20,790
But...

Maybe there is security software or something.

I just can't crack it.

You could also go and try every single combination.

Of course, I tried that as well.

Doesn't that make us about half detectives?

I guess the girl doesn't have a mom, either?

She passed away when she was younger.

Even so, I'm proud of her that she doesn't have a frown on her face.

311
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,230
It's because she has a lot of money.

312

Her dad is a big company's president anyway.

313

Gosh, what is all this ruckus?

You can go inside and rest.

As for all the dishes...

Can't you eat spicy food?

I mean, we personally tested the performance.

414
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,220
The problem is

415

453

The reason why people go to stores

454
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:35,100
has been narrowed down to seeing products with their own eyes.

457
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:47,990
Gosh, Mom. Who buys clothes at a department store these days? The internet is much cheaper.

458
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:49,610
Then why did we come here?

459
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:52,780
So we can hold it up and try it on.

460
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:56,030
The last hurdle of online shopping...

461
00:35:56,030 --> 00:36:00,040
The inconvenience of having to see the item in person

462
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,560
will be overcome by Silver Lining AR Glasses.

463

00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,570
Let's see. This is...

467
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:22,260
You'd be able to tell the difference between a 65-inch TV and a 75-inch TV...

468
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:24,620
Yes, it should be this big.

469
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:32,170
The difference between Beomyeong Motors' SUV and

470
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:34,480
a mini SUV will be felt vividly.

471
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,460
If this technology is commercialized,

472
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:41,740
AR glasses will become a daily necessity

473
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:46,690
just like today's smartphone which every modern person possesses.

474
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:52,290
President Park, are you really confident about this?

475
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:58,000
You're going to take a risk of pouring more money into a deficit business?

476
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,570
As much as the world has changed, investors must change, too.

477
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:04,740
An attitude averse to risk-taking,

478
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:08,710
disregarding value ups, and because they disregard value ups,

479
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:11,680
a culture that only tends to businesses that prosper.

480
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:15,970
Of course, that makes sense in regard to ROI.
 [Return on Investment]

481
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:20,920
So even if they're slightly nervous, they stop making follow-up investments.

482
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:26,020
But you mustn't be afraid of change.

483
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:32,870
These AR glasses will be a win-win project between Silver Lining and Beomyeong.

484
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:38,400
I'm certain it'll be the future source of profit during the Fourth Industrial Age.

485
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,340
Okay.

486
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:55,100

487
00:37:55,100 --> 00:38:00,140
Please cooperate so that we may share all of it with Silver Lining.

488
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:12,830
Oh, President Park.

489
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:14,340
