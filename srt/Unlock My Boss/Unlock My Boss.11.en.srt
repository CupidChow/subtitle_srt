00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:36,060
These words may not be very appropriate

168
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:39,050
at a time like this, but

169
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,970
congratulations.

170
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:42,570
Sorry?

171
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:47,910
Well, before, you became the president because I ordered you.

172
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:53,160
This time, you regained the president's seat with your own hands, In Seong.

173
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:57,550
President Park!

174
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:00,110
What's the matter, Secretary Jeong?

175
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,880
Hello.

176
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:21,220
Why would you come here?

177
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,490
Why not? A subsidiary's president came back.

178
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:27,070
Of course, I should at least welcome him.

179
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,740
Welcome?

180
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,430
The audacity.

181
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:33,130
You're the one who killed him.

182
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:39,590
I-I really don't know what you're talking about.

183
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:45,760
How can you kill someone innocent?

184
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:54,720
Well, I have been a bit curious since the beginning.

185
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,400
I know President Kim Seon Ju quite well, but

186
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:02,610
there never was anyone named Park In Seong around him.

187
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:11,090
How exactly do you know Seon Ju?

188
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,320
Gosh, you know how things are.

189
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,780
That innocent person could happen to be

190
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,610
you next time, President Park.

191
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:20,740
If not,

192
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,760
then maybe your family even?

193
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,490
What now?

194
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:26,930
Executive Director Oh Mi Ran!

195
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:28,780
Do you say you know me?

196
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,200
Sure.

197
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,070
Mi Ran, you might have known me, but

198
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:35,360
I'm the one who didn't know you. That's why I ended up like this!

199
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,930
Wh-Who is it?

200
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:40,370
You must be quite terrified because you know what you've done.

201
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:42,930
Wh-What's this? What the hell is this?

202
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:47,550
The welcoming took longer than I expected. I have a meeting now.

203
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,510
What brings you so suddenly?

204
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:31,430
I'm sorry for making you worry.

205
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,570
Fortunately, I was able to handle the situation because I was informed promptly.

206
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:38,350
- This is indeed Seon Ju.
- Sorry?

207
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:42,860
You're sure he was unconscious the whole time, right?

208
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,220
Yes.

209
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,200
He's been this way ever since that day.

210
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,150
Are you sure about this?

211
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:02,970
How could I dare to lie in front of you, Executive Director?

212
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:09,270
President Kim Seon Ju told me to deliver this report to Vice Chairman Oh Yeong Geun.

213
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:27,300
The leaves have grown too large. Please change the pot.

214
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,950
I'll prepare a new flower pot.

215
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:40,240
Why aren't you here yet?

216
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:45,100
I'm sorry for being late, Princess. I'm almost there.

217

This time I–

00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,440
- I can't hear you–
- Min Ah!

223
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,470
Your voice keeps dying.

224
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:50,340
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's going on?

225
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,550
What's this? Did it break down?

226
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,050
What's wrong?

227
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,060
Now, then.

228
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,240
You need to come with us.

229
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:28,230
Shit! Follow him!

00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,170
Gosh, seriously.

234
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:40,690
Shit.

235
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:41,810
Hey!

236
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:43,580
Which way did he go?

237
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:11,440
It's that way!

What's wrong?

243
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:54,780
Does it hurt?

244
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,200
Stand up now.

245
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,970
Let's go now.

246
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:15,690
Let's go, all right?

247
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:30,880
Go check on him.

248
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:33,350
Shit.

249
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:42,340
He suffered a diffuse axonal injury, so

250
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,720
I took emergency measures.

251
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,960
But he's still unconscious.

252
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,850
So what?

253
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:52,180
Well, I'll need to keep watching to tell if he'll ever wake up.

But the longer it takes,

I'm sorry. It's my mistake.

Yes, Executive Director.

I'm sincerely looking forward to working with you.

was right to sign this contract, right?

There you go again.

274

While Seon Joo was lying unconscious in front of me,
[If it's gold, it'll shine. If it's iron, it'll rust.]

275
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:32,900
I got an email in his name.

276
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,480
Someone else could've sent it with Kim Seon Ju's account.

277
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,870
Not at all.

278
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:38,930

279
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:41,440
It's a phrase I learned from Seon Ju.

280
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:49,570
I was anxious because someone appeared to be acting as Seon Ju.

281
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:54,050
Just how much and how far did Kim Seon Ju prepare?

282
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:59,130
So until I find the cards he's holding,

283
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:03,250
I asked to wait and see.

284
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:13,830
If he's unable to play them even when he's cornered like this,

285
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:17,200
he either has useless cards or no cards at all.

286
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:22,140
That's also possible.

287
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,920
Long tails are bound to get stepped on.

288
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:30,650
Since things have come down to this, we'll remove this and—

Excuse me?

291
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:54,500
Seon Ju will serve as the joker for me.

292
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:04,200
Why did you do that, President? It's not like you. What would Executive Director Oh have thought?

293
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,610
She's probably more confused than anyone.

294
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:10,940
Because Kim Seon Ju, who was lying down in front of her, spoke to her.

295
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:13,830
Exactly. Why did you make such a risky move?

296
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:15,780
It's for our sake.

297
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,040
What?

298
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:20,970
Why do you think Executive Director Oh left you and me alive?

299
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:25,820
She's anxious because she doesn't know our hand.

300
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,980
Is that why you intentionally bluffed?

301
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:35,260
We need to make it seem like there's still someone else behind Park In Seong.

302
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:41,200
Fear reaches its height in the absence of truth.

Se Yeon?

304
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:59,390
She's about to leave home.

305

I'll send you the location.

306
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:14,200
Who could she be waiting for?

307
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,060
I think she's here.

308
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,570
Wh-What are you doing?

309
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:37,780
Oh, my.

Gosh, what a terrible thing to say.

312
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:46,570
I-I was just...

313
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:48,550
Just what?

314
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:51,350
I was selling used items.

315
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,740
What?

316
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:58,910
I mean, the clothes that don't fit Min Ah anymore or her toys.

317
00:25:58,910 --> 00:26:03,650
The ones she doesn't play with anymore. It's a waste to just throw them all out. They're all expensive brands.

318
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,190
It's true.

319
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,910
Right? Do you want to see this?

320
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:14,220

The future is also Young Woong's era!

(Healthy and happy, Catchphrase of Lim Young Woong)

493
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:49,840
I'm a fan of Lim Young Woong Oppa.

494
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:58,170
Baro, please play Lim Young Woong's "Trust In Me."

495

Okay, understood. This is Young Woong's era.

What about President Kim?

498
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:20,620
Oh, he said he'll sleep with Min Ah in her room tonight.

499
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:22,650
I see.

500
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:27,490
I'm glad Min Ah believed us.

501
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:30,430
If I had only known. I would've shown her sooner.

502
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:32,080
I'm almost regretting it.

503
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,600
It's because we can't help it right now,

504
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,580
but it's dangerous, to be honest.

505
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:39,790
It isn't something for a seven-year-old to handle.

506
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:46,910
Is it true?

507

Baro 4.0 has been completed?

00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:52,050
Yes. Please lower your voice.

- What are you going to do if someone hears you?
- I'm sorry.

510
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:58,900
- Does that mean you were developing it secretly so far?
- Of course!

511
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:02,960
As Silver Lining's president, I only did what I had to do.

512
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,650
Okay.

Give me your phone, too, Executive Director.

518
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:31,200
Do you want to make a trade?

519
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,500
I possess many things.

525

You know the head-of-the-table effect, right?

526
00:41:55,100 --> 00:42:00,120
You finally seem like a president, In Seong.

527
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:03,710
But before that,

there's something we need to rectify together.

531
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:51,100
I think it's unfortunate how

532
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:55,140
baseless rumors about Silver Lining and

533
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:56,760
President Kim Seon Ju have been going around so far.

534
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:02,620
To call them baseless rumors, isn't it true President Kim Seon Ju vanished overnight?

535

but focusing on developing Baro 4.0 under strict confidentiality.

537
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:21,420
And since it's finally complete, I've invited all of you here.

538

How can we believe what you're saying?

539

It's been a long time.

540
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:41,970
I'm President Kim Seon Ju of Silver Lining.

Silver Lining is a global IT company.

546

Isn't it possible that this video clip is a deepfake or false?

547
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:05,700
Does that mean

548

I'm also fake, according to you?

549

Baro 4.0 is

551

a core project not just for Silver Lining,

00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,700
but for Beomyeong Motors too.

553
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,200
Technology competition and leaking information are serious issues among top domestic and foreign

To become the first movers of self-driving cars, Executive Director Oh and I

556
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,800
couldn't help but take this inconvenient measure

557
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,000
until the perfect Baro 4.0 was developed.

558
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,200
Did you develop a level four self-driving car with domestic technologies?

559
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,400
Will it be launched on National Foundation day next month as planned?

560
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,200
When will it be fully commercialized?

561
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,700
How much profit do you expect?

562
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,100
Yes.

563
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,400
They said she has arrived.

564

The world-famous SF writer, Arthur Clarke, said the following.

565
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,200
"Any sufficiently advanced technology is"

566
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:29,100
"indistinguishable from magic."

Gosh,

568
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:37,000
I really thought I had met Seon Ju in person just now.

569

To become the first movers of self-driving cars,

570
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:43,800
Executive Director Oh and I couldn't help but–

571
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,400
You're still audacious.

572
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,700
Why?

573
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:54,500
You're the one who came to me first, President Park In Seong.

574
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,700
Honestly,

575
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:02,100
I was worried about whether people

576
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:04,400
would believe this showcase or not.

577
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:08,400
But right in this spot... shit,

578
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,400
I totally fell for it, didn't I?

579
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:15,800
When I thought about that, I was sure we'd succeed.

580
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:22,660
You did a good job.

581
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:27,900
The showcase was an appetizer.

582
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:31,800
Let's talk about the main dish.

583
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,800
Well,

584
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,500
sure.

585
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:39,200
There's a vacation villa I know.

586
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:42,600
I'll leave you the address separately.

587
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:46,200
Four o'clock on Saturday afternoon.

588
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:50,200
Let's each grab what we desire there.

589
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:04,500
You better let go of your hand!

590
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:07,300
Tell Oh Mi Ran to come!

591
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,400
What an impertinent bastard.

592
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:17,200
How dare you lay your hand on me?

593
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,800
My apologies.

594
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,600
It's a very disadvantageous condition

595
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:40,300
because we need to go in there, not knowing what kind of a place it is.

596
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:43,700
So I'm not sure if it's right to make this deal.

597
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:47,400
Will she willingly hand over President Kim's body?

598
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:50,000
What if we just end up losing Baro 4.0 to her?

599
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,500
The worst-case scenario will be after that.

600
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,800
They take away Baro 4.0, and

601
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:00,200
there's no guarantee for our safety either.

602
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:08,000
That's why we need to prepare.

603
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:25,400
Hey, hey.

604
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:29,700
You looked great with the chairman-to-be of Beomyeong on the two-shot.

605
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:32,600
Why bother to come to see me and

606
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:35,300
eat this mere gukbap*?
(Hot soup with rice)

607
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:46,800
Thank you for the data you gave me, Detective.

608
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,000
I'm the crazy one

609
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,300
to have entrusted a fish to a cat.

610
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:54,800
If you want to put a bell around the cat's neck,

611
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:58,000
you should be prepared to lose a fish or two at least.

612
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:01,270
I see.

613
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:04,790
So

614
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:09,800
are you sure you have put a bell

615
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:12,300
around Executive Director Oh?

616
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:19,400
4:00 p.m. on Saturday at a vacation villa in Namyangju-si,

617
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:23,700
there will be decisive evidence to lock up Oh Mi Ran.

618
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,870
Are you confident?

619
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:36,950
Take a look at the chairman-to-be and see

620
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:39,290
if she looks good in a mugshot

621
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,200
instead of a two-shot.

622
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,200
What about Uncle?

623
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,400
He's looking into whether Baro 4.0 is true or not.

624
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,800
Your head must hurt a lot.

625
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:01,200
By the way, how was Baro 4.0 completed without Kim Seon Ju–

626
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:04,000
As a business partner,

627
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,700
I just want them to have succeeded.

628
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:08,600
Moreover,

629
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:11,300
would it even matter if it

630
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:14,500
- were a bluff?
- Sorry?

631
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:19,500
Beomyeong Motors' stock price will rocket anyway, just from the news

632
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:22,400
of self-driving cars getting launched,

633
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,600
and it will grant me the chairman's seat.

634
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:31,170
But if they end up taking President Kim Seon Ju–

635
00:50:34,450 --> 00:50:36,310
Sorry.

636
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:40,200
Captain Noh...

637
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:44,400
you still don't seem to know me well.

638
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:49,200
You know...

639
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:52,300
no one has ever taken what's mine away

640
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:54,800
from me, not even once.

641
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:01,000
It'll be the same this time as well.

642
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:28,600
Dad! Do you know which princess I like the most?

643
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:31,100
Princess? Which one was it again?

644
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:33,860
Snow White?

645
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:36,700
I'm disappointed.

646
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:39,000
Did you have fun with Dad?

647
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:43,700
Yes, but Dad had forgotten that I like Little Mermaid the most.

648
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:45,500
Really?

649
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:47,000
That's so insensitive.

650
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,900
Ariel is the best princess, right?
