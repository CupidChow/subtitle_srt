Just leave it.

319

There's no guarantee I'll still be here after a restart.

00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:21,860
If you have my phone, they'll be suspicious of you.

332
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:24,400
[We Make Future]

333
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,300
Before your first day, you need to remember some things.

334
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:33,510
Hello.

335
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:36,550
Beomyeoung's Executive Director, Oh Mi Ran.

336
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:43,490
As Chairman Oh Beom Geun, founder and her father, suddenly lost consciousness last year,

337
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:45,970
she's taken the role of Chairman, more or less.

338
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:48,300
Regarding the progress on the development of self-driven cars...

339
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:52,440
As Beomyeong Car's biggest shareholder, she plans to succeed with self-driven cars

340
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:56,150
and officially become Chairwoman, stepping over her uncle.

341
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:58,800
This is the end of my presentation. Thank you.

342
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:04,640
So she'd need Silver Lining's help to make the brains of those cars, right?

343
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,520
And Vice Chairman Oh Yeong Geun can't stand to see that.

344
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:12,250
As he served a prison sentence in his brother's place, he's not a man who holds back.

345
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:14,890
He also has an exceptional loyalty toward Beomyeong.

346
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:18,600
He'll never be satisfied with being the Vice Chairman.

347
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,240
We're just a shrimp getting crushed by those two whales, then?

348
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:26,740
Silver Lining is not a shrimp.

349
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:30,750
We're the kingmaker who can hop on any of the whales' backs.

350
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,030
Director Kwak will be outside.

351
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:38,160
He's a typical "strong to the weak" and "weak to the strong" type.

352
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,710
He's from Beomyeong Electronics, who worked under Oh Yeong Geun.

353
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,230
He was planted to hold me in check.

354
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:45,200
Today is the new president's first day of work.

355
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,760
Let us greet him with a devout and genuine heart. Understood?

356
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,430
- Yes, Sir.
- Okay, line up.

357
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,330
Button these up.

358
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,400
Is it always like this?

359
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,900
It wasn't like this when I was here.

360
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:08,560
They became old-fashioned because their boss changed.

361
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:13,050
President!

362
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:14,780
How do you do?

363
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:17,910
Act as naturally as you can.

364
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:26,440
What are you doing? Hurry and go!

365
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,420
Right. Don't be afraid, Park In Seong.

366
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:32,110
You were the golden 27th Class of Evergreen Troupe.

367
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:34,320
What is there that I haven't done?

368
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,470
I've done my best with any role.

369
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:40,390
This is my stage and...

370
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:43,110
from this moment on, I'm the president.

371
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:44,360
Sound!

372
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,720
Speed!

373
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,300
- Camera!
- Roll.

374
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,320
One to one to one.

375
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,030
Ready...

376
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:52,670
action!

377
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,400
What are you doing right now?

378
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,870
Shouldn't you all be working?

379
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:10,410
This kind of protocol...

380
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:12,810
I absolutely hate it.

381
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:15,790
Don't do it ever again.

382
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:17,950
Okay.

383
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:20,690
Okay, dismissed.

384
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:29,580
Did you have any discomfort on your ride over, Sir?

385
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:31,900
The Pyeongyang noodles from back then?

386
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,410
Hello.

387
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:36,130
I'm Secretary Jeong Se Yeon.

388
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:38,640
I see a road of flowers in front of my–

389
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:42,200
The shirt, right?

390
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,160
Come this way, President.

391
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,930
Yes.

392
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:55,670
Do you and Secretary Jeong know each other?

393
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,250
We met once by coincidence.

394
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:12,260
Excuse me. That day...

395
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:18,040
You don't need to explain how a job seeker became

396
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,440
the president overnight.

397
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:31,440
- It's this way.
- Okay.

398
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:51,060
[Office of President (CEO), Park In Seong]

399
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:20,080
I prepared as much as possible in a hurry, but is there anything else you need?

400
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,210
This is sufficient.

401
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:26,630
It feels new to be seeing you like this again.

402
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:28,160
That's true.

403
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:33,610
It wasn't that I interviewed you, but the new boss, you, had interviewed us.

404
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:39,920
I just knew you were different from the interview.

405
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,890
Is that so?

406
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:45,220
Your preparedness to inspect in advance like a secret royal inspector...

407
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:53,250
If I was rude in any way, I apologize.

408
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:03,600
I heard from President Kim Seon Ju via email.

409
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,920
Yes. Well...

410
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,340
By the way,

411
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:11,820
what's your relationship with President Kim?

412
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:14,600
Age, schooling, hometown,

413
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:18,030
and even your looks.

414
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:21,500
You have nothing in common.

415
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:25,140
Let's say we have a particular relationship.

416
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:29,690
Exactly how are you particularly related?

417
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,990
That's...

418
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:34,470
It's okay.

419
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:36,000
It's okay.

420
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,090
I touch him like this.

421
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:41,430
Sorry?

422
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,120
Meddling...

423
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:50,280
with each other and advising a type of touch and no touch.

424
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,060
You understood, right?

425
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,920
By the way,

426
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,670
I've never been a president before.

427
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:02,940
Aigoo...

428
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:05,400
Who ever gets to be born as president?

429
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,060
You learn as you go.

430
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:12,640
Even if that's true, I just have no experience.

431
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:17,680
More so, you need to be given opportunities to realize...

432
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:21,110
your capabilities.

433
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:24,960
You're very different from when I first met you.

434
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:28,700
You see... I might lack some hair* here,
(*He says the word for "thoughtless" here, but it sounds like "hair")

435
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:32,340
but I'm a warm person once you get to know me.

436
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,190
What would you

437
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:41,640
like to do about your secretary?

438
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,640
- Sorry?
- I'm talking about Secretary Jeong.

439
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,870
Usually, when a new president comes,

440
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:53,630
it's very common to bring the secretary they already work with.

441
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:59,110
What do I do? Should I get a new secretary?

442
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:02,050
Secretary Jeong worked with me for a long time.

443
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:06,210
She doesn't talk lightly or show her emotions easily.

444
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:07,600
Then I won't replace her.

445
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:11,620
On the other hand, it means knowing her true feelings is that much more difficult.

446
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:15,560
As much as she knows me well, there's a high chance of her finding out about us.

447
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,730
Then I'll replace her right away.

448
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:21,160
She's fully aware of my official itinerary and private schedules as well.

449
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:25,250
She probably also accompanied me at the last golf course meeting.

450
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:31,290
I might be able to find a clue from Se Yeon, then.

451
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:37,570
Secretary Jeong could be the most trustworthy ally or

452
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:42,970
the most lethal foe at the same time.

453
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:56,800
Now, what should I do?

454
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:01,430
Go to the President's Office and connect my phone to the computer.

455
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:05,590
For what purpose–

456
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,430
Sh*t...

457
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:10,750
Ahjumma!

458
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,500
- I'm sorry.
- Are you crazy?

459
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,450
I told you not to put cleaning tools in front of the restroom, didn't I?

460
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:16,820
- Look!
- I was mopping the floor, so...

461
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:18,560
Look, a person fell over there!

462
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,450
- I'm sorry.
- How many times do I need to tell you? So annoying!

463
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:22,420
- Do you want to get fired?
- I'm sorry

464
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:25,710
Excuse me. It was my mistake. I was looking at my phone, so–

465
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:29,700
- Hurry and wipe it.
- Just leave.

466
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,640
Wipe it up right now!

467
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:35,500
I wasn't going to say this, but

468
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:39,080
this is why you're cleaning the restroom at that age!

469
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:44,190
I wasn't going to say this, but

470
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:47,750
this is why you're still doing part-time jobs at that age!

471
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:52,550
This is my stage and

472
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:54,440
I've got influence.

473
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,930
Ready...

474
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:57,630
action!

475
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:02,210
Don't do anything that makes you stand out.

476
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:06,380
- Wipe it up!
- Are you the only one working here, Ahjussi?

477
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,240
You're so annoying.

478
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,460
Do you want to get fired?

479
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:12,480
Who the heck are you?

480
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:17,110
I really wasn't going to say this, but

481
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:20,650
this is why you're abusing your position at that age!

482
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,490
It's upsetting

483
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:27,770
to be on the receiving end, right?

484
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:31,540
This young bastard. Who do you think I am?

485
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,230
Hey!

486
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:34,990
I'm Team Manager Nam of the Sales Department.

487
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:36,930
Which department are you from?

488
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:42,140
He's the newly appointed President, Park In Seong.

489
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:45,600
President, please come this way.

490
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,500
Thank you so much.

491
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:02,780
Your action just now is a clear violation of the contract.

492
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:06,040
I'll apply the three-strikes policy. You have one strike.

493
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,790
I'm sorry.

494
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:10,140
I really wanted to try it once.

495
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,600
Abusing my power.

496
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,100
[Abusing my power ♡]

497
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,650
My first day of work is already so hectic.

498
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:21,080
"Connect your phone to the computer"?

499
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,190
Yes.

500
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:26,430
I need to check if there were attempts to hack Baro 4.0 in the past few days.

501
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,500
If it's the beta version, does that mean it's still being developed?

502
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,860
There are more tests to do.

503
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:39,150
Wow, it even has Son Heung Min.

504
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:42,080
Because he's Silver Lining's model.

505
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:46,400
We can even create your voice with just one hour of recording.

506
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:51,730
Basically the same principle as listening to recent songs in deceased Kim Kwang Seok's voice.

507
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:57,040
I took a step further from there.

508
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:00,050
Baro, what should I wear today?

509
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:01,800
Current temperature is 18°C.

510
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,650
I suggest a dress that goes well with the spring breeze.

511
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:08,330
Okay! A dress!

512
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,610
Baro, what should I wear today?

513
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:15,310
Current temperature is 18°C.

514
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:18,240
I suggest a dress that goes well with the spring breeze.

515
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,300
Gosh, you idiot.

516
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:25,460
So far, AIs were designed to give the same answers to the same questions.

517
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:32,520
However, we're developing a customized AI which does deep learning on certain individuals at Silver Lining.

518
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:37,100
It's not your generic AI masked under the name of versatility.

519
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:43,500
It's an AI that thinks, decides, and talks like Son Heung Min, my mom, or me.

520
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,800
Baro 4.0 will be just that.

521
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,710
I see. Is that why

522
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:51,060
you became the test model as well?

523
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:53,330
Don't try to know more.

524
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:56,840
I'm still a president, so I need to know–

525
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:01,530
I can trust you because you don't know anything.

526
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:06,200
The more you know, the less I'll be able to trust you.

527
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:20,640
This is President Kim Seon Ju of Silver Lining.

528
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:24,500
Due to a decline in health, the previous president will take a sabbatical.

529
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:30,010
I'm contacting you to approve the appointment of the next president.

530
00:35:30,010 --> 00:35:31,990
- Move aside!
- You can't do this, Sir.

531
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:33,930
- You won't move?
- I can't let you pass.

532
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:35,200
Move aside!

533
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,270
- Move out of the way!
- Vice Chairman!

534

- What the heck is going on?
- Vice Chairman!

535
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:39,990
One moment, please.

536
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:43,150
Hey, move out of my way!

537
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,960
What are you scheming now?

538
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,330
Please calm down, Vice Chairman.

539
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:56,530
This is the Beomyeong Group Chairwoman's Office.

540
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:57,800
Yes.

541
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:02,100
When Hyeong-nim was in this place, there were fundamental principles. However,

542
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:05,300
during this critical period, take a sabbatical?

543
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:11,800
During this critical period, could he be facing an unavoidable circumstance?

544
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:17,380
On top of that, appointing a young brat as the president!

545
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:20,530
The board of directors won't just sit back!

546
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:23,810
As the largest shareholder of Beomyeong, I approved.

547
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:27,660
Who exactly won't sit back?

548
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,880
Why don't you just wait and see?

549
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,460
If it's gold, it'll shine.

550

If it's iron, it'll rust.

Yeong Geun's.

554
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:50,430
And then...

00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,880
Mi Ran.

557
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:06,230
So you're saying as Silver Lining's stock price rises, Beomyeong Electronics' value falls, right?

558
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:08,600
You catch on faster than I expected.

559
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:13,110
Inherently, Silver Lining and Vice Chairman Oh can't get along.

560
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:19,240
Who's there?

561
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:30,100
It's the list of new secretaries from Director Kwak.

562
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,300
All four of them can start working tomorrow.

563
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:38,200
There must be a misunderstanding. I haven't decided to replace my secretary...

[Office of President (CEO), Park In Seong]

Are you acting out of line again?

566
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:03,800
Park In Seong, I clearly warned you.

567
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:07,520
Clearly, our deal was to make me president, not to be an avatar.

This.

575
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:36,900
Wow, did you already finish reviewing it?

576
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:43,000
Do you also want to check out your replacement?

577
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,100
Pardon?

578
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:48,530
Why would you give the list of Secretary Jeong's replacements to her?

579
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:50,140
Because that's her job.

580
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:53,460
Did you have to make her deliver the list of people who will replace her?

That's how it was done–

I told you not to come to my work.

594
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:13,130
I told you I only trust money.

595
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:28,980
I won't have a reason to see you again after this, right?

596
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:34,810
How did you get this money?

597
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:36,890
I just need to pay back the money.

598
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:38,460
Why?

599
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:40,780
You won't take it if it's dirty money?

600
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:45,200
Write a receipt

601
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:49,510
saying I paid off my debt.

602

Write a receipt before you go.

What do you mean?

604

There's 50 million won remaining.

605
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:57,160
Do you think money grows on trees for me?

606
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,480
Of course, you have to pay the interest.

607
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,940
You should've paid me sooner if you were going to end up paying me anyway.

608
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,630
I'll see you again.

609
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:11,890
Se Yeon is a good person,

610
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:14,010
so I've decided to work with her.

611
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:17,360
You've known her for a total of six hours and 48 minutes since getting to work,

612
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:20,120
and you've deemed her a good person?

613
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:23,470
I think Se Yeon will become a reliable ally.

614
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:25,250
And your reason?

615
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:27,020
Do you have a basis for that conclusion?

616
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:36,080
Her shirt.

617
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:44,510
This is a woman's size.

618
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:50,100
I wish my stocks would jump, but instead

619

the tame cat is the first to jump on the table.*
(*A Korean saying that means watch out for the quiet ones)

620
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:56,350
It's not what you're thinking.

621
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:57,940
What do you think I'm thinking?

622
00:41:57,940 --> 00:42:00,270
What exactly am I thinking?

623
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:02,160
Is she pretty?

624
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,350
Her heart is pretty.

625
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:08,950
It had nothing to do with her, but she stepped up to help.

626
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:12,010
Oh, the one who lent you her shirt for the interview?

627
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:12,880
Yes.

628
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,740
- Wow.
- She's a good person.

629
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:21,350
A good person?

630
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:24,420
Then why are you blushing? Huh?

631
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:25,650
Hey, listen carefully.

632
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:28,870
We're going to include Miss Shirt's friend for a double date.

I can act as the WD-40 in the middle, so you can just relax.

634

My instincts tell me Miss Shirt is pretty.

635
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:36,950
What do you mean, shirt?

636
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:38,750
Stop saying nonsense

637
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:42,890
and convince me with precise data and probability or irrefutable logic.

638
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:46,310
It's a matter of life or death for me.

639
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:52,890
But can you really explain a person with data or probability?

640
00:42:52,890 --> 00:42:54,660
A person isn't an AI.

641
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:56,100
You're wrong.

642
00:42:56,100 --> 00:43:00,060
The probability of trusting someone recommended by Director Kwak is 0%.

643
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:03,450
In contrast, Secretary Jeong is half-half.

644
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:05,700
Secretary Jeong is the better choice.

645
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,310
This is how you should convince me from now on.

You just agreed as well.

00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:16,850
At the same time, you rammed into Director Kwak as you pleased

He's just a naïve child whose emotions escape him,

so you can rest assured.

00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:29,980
Yes.

654
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:40,140
That's what I thought.

655
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:43,540
How dare such a baseless bastard...

656
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:47,640
I'll have the board of directors propose a dismissal.

657
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:51,260
What can we gain from chasing out a rookie?

658
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,120
Just wait.

659
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:58,780
Let's set the stage so they'll waste some time.

660
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:03,990
That's how I can blow away Silver Lining and my f*cking niece*.
(*He pronounces the word "niece" in Korean to sound like the f-word)

661
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:05,920
Understood.

662
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:10,270
How did that thing go?

663
00:44:10,270 --> 00:44:12,370
I'm looking into it.

664
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:16,320
Okay, keep at it.

665
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:35,060
I can't believe I get to live in a place like this.

666
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:38,370
I never knew I'd live somewhere like this, either.

667
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:42,270
I guess...

668
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:45,240
You should be living in a 67 pyeong* house in Pyeongchang-dong,
(1 pyeong = 35.5832 sq. ft.)

669
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:48,010
but you're living in a 6.7 inch space.

670
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:49,930
- Oh?
 - What?

671
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:51,200
Is something wrong?

672
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,360
It's already 6:00 p.m.

673
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,720
Since I'm the boss,

674
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,750
I can just leave on the dot without walking on eggshells, right?

675
00:44:57,750 --> 00:44:59,890
You didn't really seem like the type to walk on eggshells to begin with.

676
00:44:59,890 --> 00:45:01,960
Wow, goosebumps!

677
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:04,380
I get that a lot.

678
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:10,570
I guess we've become really close in this short time.

679
00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:28,980
Se Yeon, Are you not getting...

680
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:30,640
off work?*
(*Made a pun with her name)

681
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:37,960
It's already five minutes past 6:00 p.m.

682
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,140
These are handover materials.

683
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:45,950
Well...

684
00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:48,730
Throw them out,

685
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:51,770
Secretary Jeong.

686
00:45:53,690 --> 00:45:55,600
See you tomorrow!

687
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:19,510
Is it here?

688
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:22,950
That two-story house is my house.

689
00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:27,290
- Could I buy this kind of house with 1 billion–
 - You cannot.

690
00:46:27,290 --> 00:46:28,860
What?

691
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:32,520
With 1 billion won, you could maybe buy a bedroom.

692
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:36,390
Wow, my sorry one-room life...

693
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,910
Anyway, is she even coming?

694
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:46,590
Min Ah likes to buy chocolate cookies from the mart.

695
00:46:46,590 --> 00:46:50,700
After buying groceries with the nanny, she should be home about now.

696
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:52,970
It's SDMLH.

697
00:46:52,970 --> 00:46:54,530
Sorry?

698
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:58,740
"Spending Definitely Makes Life Happier."

699
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:02,920
That kid knows the taste of capitalism.

700
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:06,200
She's coming.

701
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:10,970
Oh, she doesn't know me.

702
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,580
Is that her?

703
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:22,850
She's so cute.

704
00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:50,950
Are you okay?

705
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:53,010
We waited all this time.

706
00:47:53,010 --> 00:47:54,520
You only saw her for a minute.

707
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:56,520
Let's just go.

708
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:03,920
He's coming back out.

709
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:04,980
Is he going home?

710
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:08,060
No, they're both live-in caretakers.

711
00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:16,730
He drives pretty recklessly.

712
00:48:17,690 --> 00:48:19,820
Follow him!

713
00:48:19,820 --> 00:48:21,690
- Sorry?
 - I said, follow him!

714
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:23,490
Why? I went through the trouble to get here.

715
00:48:23,490 --> 00:48:25,770
Hurry and follow him!

716
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:55,580
Seeing how I'm in this state, there definitely must be a disruption in their plan.

717
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:11,710
They'll be approaching to get a grip on the situation.

718
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:19,010
In that case, there's no other suitable target than Butler Shim.

719
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:24,240
[I have arrived.]
Or...

720
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:27,120
He might already be an accomplice.

721
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:22,400
Go and find out who he's meeting.

722
00:50:29,490 --> 00:50:31,400
Welcome.

723
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:48,000
Who is that?

724
00:51:02,790 --> 00:51:04,780
What?

725
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:06,980
Why is Se Yeon coming out from there?

726
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:10,400
President, take a look.

727
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,300
Go back home right now!

728
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:14,630
- What?
- Now!

729
00:51:15,390 --> 00:51:17,070
Hurry!

730
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:31,400
Bring out the manilla envelope from my study.

731
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:33,970
I'll release the door lock.

732
00:51:35,190 --> 00:51:38,060
You can go in now.

733
00:51:40,210 --> 00:51:42,810
Around this time, the nanny will have put Min Ah to sleep and

734
00:51:42,810 --> 00:51:44,830
should be cross-stitching in her room.

735
00:51:44,830 --> 00:51:47,590
You have about one hour.

736
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:04,510
What do I do now?

737
00:52:04,510 --> 00:52:07,660
I-I don't think I can enter through the front door.

738
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:10,130
Go to the right side.

739
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:14,480
To the left now.

740
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:17,100
No, no. Further ahead.

741
00:52:21,910 --> 00:52:24,320
To the left from here.

742
00:52:26,670 --> 00:52:27,800
It's huge.

743
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:30,790
Go in through the poolside door.

744
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,790
Don't worry about the CCTV.

745
00:52:34,790 --> 00:52:36,940
I'll erase the footage.

746
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:44,890
You said you'll make me a president, but you're making me a thief instead?

747
00:52:44,890 --> 00:52:48,170
Did you think it'd be easy to earn one billion won?

748
00:52:54,150 --> 00:52:55,640
Take your shoes off.

749
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:59,210
I can't erase your footsteps from inside a phone.

750
00:53:05,210 --> 00:53:09,030
The study is the last room on the second floor.

751
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:31,520
There's someone in there.

752
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:33,230
It's armor.

753
00:53:33,230 --> 00:53:34,960
An armor!

754
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,270
It's empty inside.

755
00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:46,500
There's no time. Hurry and go!

756
00:54:25,710 --> 00:54:28,440
Ji Hye went down to the first floor.

757
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:46,500
Wow...

758
00:54:47,310 --> 00:54:50,710
Wow, there's a car in here!

759
00:54:50,710 --> 00:54:53,410
It's an expensive car. Be careful.

760
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,500
Where is the envelope again?

761
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:59,310
The safe next to the desk on the second floor.

762
00:55:01,190 --> 00:55:03,980
Go up the staircase over there.

763
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,290
I can't see because it's dark.

764
00:55:09,290 --> 00:55:11,870
Let's just come back when no one is home.

765
00:55:11,870 --> 00:55:13,350
You saw at the café.

766
00:55:13,350 --> 00:55:14,770
They've started to make their move.

767
00:55:14,770 --> 00:55:16,970
We need to find it immediately.

768
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:21,740
This isn't a study.

769
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:23,170
It's larger than my house.

770
00:55:23,170 --> 00:55:25,860
There should be a safe next to the desk.

771
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:34,420
There's a passcode here.

772
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:37,440
Zero, six, three, zero.

773
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:52,470
There's nothing!

774
00:55:52,470 --> 00:55:53,770
Did you look properly?

775
00:55:53,770 --> 00:55:55,930
The manilla envelope isn't there?

776
00:55:55,930 --> 00:55:57,540
There's nothing inside!

777
00:55:57,540 --> 00:56:00,380
L-Let me take a look!

778
00:56:01,690 --> 00:56:03,920
There's no way it could be missing!

779
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:05,540
Are you sure you left it in here?

780
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:06,870
You could be mistaken.

781
00:56:06,870 --> 00:56:09,720
No, no. I always leave it there.

782
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:15,920
By the way what exactly is it?

783
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:18,270
I need to know what it is to find it.

784
00:56:26,390 --> 00:56:29,530
Wait a minute. The hallway lights turned on!

785
00:56:42,570 --> 00:56:45,600
Calmly hide yourself.

786
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:48,980
- What do I do now?
- Calmly!

787
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:55,480
We never know, so let's look a little–

788
00:57:21,530 --> 00:57:23,340
Han Ji Hye is coming to the study.

789
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:26,020
Hurry! Hurry!

790
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:03,330
What do I do, President?

791
00:58:03,330 --> 00:58:05,200
If I get caught now–

792
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:06,450
Oh, my gosh!

793
00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:08,380
What's wrong?

794
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:10,470
I thought I heard something from the study.

795
00:58:10,470 --> 00:58:11,980
There's no way.

796
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:14,380
President isn't even here.

797
00:58:31,030 --> 00:58:33,160
[Restricted Caller ID]

798
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:35,360
Didn't you hear it just now?

799
00:58:36,790 --> 00:58:38,070
I heard it.

800
00:58:38,070 --> 00:58:40,400
It sounded like a phone.

801
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:57,690
Oh, my. It was mine.

802
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:01,070
It's the president!

803
00:59:01,070 --> 00:59:02,480
What?

804
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:04,490
What did he say?

805
00:59:04,490 --> 00:59:06,970
He said he'll give me a raise.

806
00:59:08,090 --> 00:59:10,390
How silly. It was mine.

807
00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:46,690
My heart almost stopped.

808
00:59:49,910 --> 00:59:52,560
You don't come from Silicon Valley for no reason, right?

809
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:55,010
How did you think to send a text in that split moment?

810
00:59:55,010 --> 00:59:56,760
You just need to trust me now.

811
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:59,870
Wow...

812
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:02,520
What's this?

813
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:04,970
Restricted caller ID?

814
01:00:04,970 --> 01:00:08,450
[Why are you not picking up? I'm the owner of that phone.]

815
01:00:08,450 --> 01:00:11,820
What's this nonsense? This is Kim Seon Ju's phone.

816
01:00:22,230 --> 01:00:24,480
[Give me my phone back!]

817
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:26,680

01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:29,340
What is your identity?

819
01:01:09,365 --> 01:01:12,923
[Unlock My Boss]

820
01:01:12,923 --> 01:01:15,305
Are you really Kim Seon Ju?

821
01:01:15,305 --> 01:01:18,003
Do you know what the really unfair thing is?

822
01:01:18,003 --> 01:01:21,078
Daring to sit in that seat for once...

823
01:01:21,078 --> 01:01:25,368
Are you telling me to live at your house, President?

824
01:01:25,368 --> 01:01:27,398
Se Yeon must also be quite confused.

825
01:01:27,398 --> 01:01:30,372
Looking back, they were days of agony.

826
01:01:30,372 --> 01:01:32,551
Are you able to communicate with the president?

827
01:01:32,551 --> 01:01:39,136
President of the renowned Silver Lining should at least take responsibility for what he said.

828
01:01:40,133 --> 01:01:41,467
Dodge!

829
01:01:41,467 --> 01:01:43,567
Move!
