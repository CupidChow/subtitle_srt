00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:27,050
Mr. No has been arrested.

327
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,720
I'll be responsible for you now.

328
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,650
But...

329
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:36,460
I was told to hide.

330
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,550
Why did you come find me?

331
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:42,680
My predecessor filled me in. Submit all the information you have to me.

332
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,930
What information?

333
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:49,160
I already know everything.

334
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,820
I mean...

335
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:53,070
what are you talking about?

336
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:59,320
Your life-line...

337
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,640
What you carefully compiled in case they try to make you the scapegoat.

338
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:09,000
Are you crazy? There's nothing like that.

339
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:12,570
There's nothing like that, right?

340
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:15,410
Okay. I was going to let it go from my end,

341
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:18,430
but I guess I'll need to report this to the higher-ups.

342
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:23,070
Aigoo...

343
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:25,670
At such a young age...

344
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:27,940
W-Wait.

345
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:35,520
Gosh, his acting is good.

346
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:45,650
Is this really all of it?

347
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:48,120
It's everything I have.

348
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:52,130
Please forgive me this once.

349
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:01,700
I don't make empty promises.

350
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,820
Jeong Hyeon Ho, you still got it in you.

351
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:42,770
Was my acting all right?

352
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:45,110
It was more than all right.

353
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:47,440
I thought I was watching a noir movie.

354
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,680
What the hell?

355
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,860
I'm a man who served in the military.

356
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:52,140
Yeah?

357
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,720
Then shall we...

358
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,560
go to mojito and have a glass of Maldives?*
(Famous line from the film "Inside Man")

359
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,850
Even if it's time for me to go,

360
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:02,460
a cigarette won't be a problem, would it*?
(Famous line from a Korean movie.)

361
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,790
- Man!
- We should've picked up acting again.

362
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:07,450
- Let's do it.
- Enough, you two.

363
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:09,560
Do you know who I am*?
(Famous line from a Korean movie.)

364
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,340
Se Yeon,

365
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:15,080
you made me feel humiliated.*
(Famous line from the film "A Bittersweet Life")

366
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:23,240
Grab Ji Yeon and go to the airport immediately.

367
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,840
We need to leave Korea right now!

368
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:05,400
Relax, relax, relax. I'm so exhausted.

369
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,400
Who are you?

370
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:10,500
Just be grateful.

371
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:14,300
If it weren't for me, you'd be waiting in line for the pearly gates.

372
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:20,660
Seriously, why complicate things? We can just go and get Ha Jong Baek.

373
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:24,490
Will Director Ha hand over everything just because you're the police?

374
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:28,590
It's also proof of him being an accomplice.

375
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:32,440
You're really a maniac for investigative work.

376
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,700
You've got a great mind for it.

377
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:42,240
We'll approach him as if we were sent by Executive Director Oh and secure the evidence first.

378
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,900
Let's do that.

379
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:47,580
You can leave the rest to me.

380
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:54,190
I said relax!

381
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:06,100
Tomorrow's finally the day...

382
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,680
for self-driving car launching.

383
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:11,770
Executive Director Oh's true self

384
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:14,190
will be exposed to the world, right?

385
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,390
Yes.

386
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,940
In that case,

387
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:21,930
I guess today is the last time we get to have

388
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:24,370
a can of beer like this.

389
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,370
It has to be that way.

390
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:29,850
Sorry?

391
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:33,640
Did you dislike having a beer with me that much?

392
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,280
No.

393
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:38,430
I'm saying we must get Executive Director Oh.

394
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:43,100
Do you remember?

395
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:46,270
I told you I thought you were

396
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:48,380
a weird person when I first saw you, In Seong.

397
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:50,410
Of course.

398
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:54,700
I remember it very vividly.

399
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:58,780
However, you weren't a weird person,

400
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:01,220
but a good person.

401
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:07,430
Don't get hurt tomorrow, and be careful.

402
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:10,470
Are you worrying about me?

403
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:27,030
Thank you.

404
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:50,050
Thank you.

405
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:56,430
Thank you for joining us for the self-driving car test drive.

406
00:32:56,430 --> 00:33:00,210
Everyone, when smartphones were first introduced to the world,

407
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:05,660
did you even imagine your order of things in daily life would change this much?

408
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:08,750
It's the same case for self-driving cars.

409
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:12,100
The inside of a car in which your hands are free from the wheel will become

410
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,930
a restaurant for the busy working class,

411
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:17,070
a small movie theater for couples,

412
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:20,680
and mobile lodging for travelers.

413
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,490
That's not all.

414
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:26,060
We no longer need to see heartbreaking articles

415
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:30,060
about a drunk driver taking the life of a head of a household and

416
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:34,370
fair opportunities for transportation will be provided to vulnerable users of

417
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:37,980
transportation, such as children and the handicapped.

418
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:43,960
Yes, that's correct.

419
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:47,210
Today will be recorded as the day when Beomyeong changed

420
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:51,190
the global paradigm with level four self-driving cars.

421
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:54,240
How much time do you expect it will take until commercialization?

422
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,090
How do you plan to resolve legal problems regarding public policy?

423
00:33:57,090 --> 00:34:00,080
Please tell us about its competitive edge in pricing.

424
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,390
- Yes–
- The newly developed self-driving car...

425
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:05,490
Is it safe?

426
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:12,090
He's our partner.

427
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:16,310
This is President Park In Seong of Silver Lining.

428
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,720
Self-driving car?

429
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:44,440
Shouldn't Executive Director Oh, who invested unsparingly in the development

430
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:47,260
of this self-driving car,

431
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:51,210
be its historical first user?

432
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:53,650
I'd be grateful

433
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:56,530
for the honor of being the first-ever rider.

434
00:34:57,490 --> 00:34:59,160
Please get in.

435
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:13,160
Executive Director Oh got in the car.

436
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,740
We're past the first stage.

437
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:20,910
What are you scheming?

438
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:26,610
Don't think about doing any funny business.

439
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:29,020
What funny business?

440
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:32,150
I came here as Silver Lining's president.

441
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:44,690
All right, now.

442
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:46,620
It's ready to go, Executive Director.

443
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:49,010
Okay, we'll take off now.

444
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:16,410
Beomyeong's Self-driving Car has just entered the city.

445
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:19,700
The sight of it freely running in the middle of Seoul is impressive.

446
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:24,030
Reporters in Korea and around the world are showing more attention, as well as the public.

447
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:35,240
Shall we move on to the next stage?

448
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,930
Okay.

449
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:51,420
Wh-What's wrong?

450
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:55,090
Hey, this is a scoop!

451
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:56,660
Follow them.

452
00:37:57,510 --> 00:38:01,160
The self-driving car started going in the opposite direction of the destination.

453
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:05,360
We don't know where the deviating car is headed.

454
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:13,250
There was a problem with the previous route,

455
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:16,490
so it's recalculating the route.

456
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:23,640
Announcing one more time.
[Self-driving car goes opposite direction... Doesn't know the route]

457
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,850
The self-driving car deviated from its route.

458
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:27,510
This is an unexpected situation!

459
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:31,350
Everyone at the site, please evacuate.

460
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:37,730
This is why President Kim Seon Ju was opposed to this.

461
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:40,040
He reported it to you.

462
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:43,920
If the AI, Baro 4.0, as a result of deep learning,

463
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,220
becomes convinced that there is a better route to the destination,

464
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,960
it acts so with a sense of its own identity.

465
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,810
What are you talking about, President Park?

466
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:55,630
Because an AI that gained a sense of identity is dangerous since it can override control.

467
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:59,330
President Kim Seon Ju asked to delay the launch date.

468
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:04,070
However, Executive Director, you wanted to take the chairman's seat,

469
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:06,670
so you ignored his statement

470
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:10,380
and even attempted to murder Kim Seon Ju.

471
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:14,320
The notification is ready to go.

472
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,740
I'll now transfer it.

473
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:18,300

Even so, I can't ignore an article with a title like that.

You're right.

Yes, he's okay after we gave him emergency care.

Until we're given orders,

484

he must continue to breathe.

Until we're given orders, he must continue to breathe.

What difference does it make?

489
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:54,730
We have no way of knowing whether Kim Seon Ju will wake up.

490
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:57,890
However, we can avoid creating a second victim like Kim Seon Ju.

491
00:40:57,890 --> 00:40:59,920
By whose orders are you going this far?

492
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,110
Oh Yeoung Geun? Huh?

493
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:03,460
Silver Lining's...

494
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,600
President Kim Seon Ju.

495
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:10,290
What kind of bullshit are you spewing?

496
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,930
There's–

497
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:16,410
There's no way for Kim Seon Ju to have ordered this.

498
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,400
This is the end for you.

499
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,100
Get out.

500
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:05,400
Searching for a heliport within a one km radius.

501
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:11,550
Departing now.

502
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,750
Yes.

503
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:36,000
I'm counting on you, Detective Choi.

504
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,600
♫ My back is full of sweat ♫

505
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:42,400
After the footage is sent out, Detective Choi will arrest Executive Director Oh.

506
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,500
What if she runs away in the middle?

507
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:47,600
In that case, we'll go to Plan B.

508
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:56,600
I'll make it so that she'll go to the police on her own.

509
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:04,300
Moving to a nearby heliport.

510
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,600
Yes, it's me.

511
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:08,800
Come to that place right now.

512
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,800

You've arrived at the heliport.

Yes, I'm here. I'll get off now.

00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,600
Does this mean you admit to the allegations?

533
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:45,800
Just think that you played a racing game.

534
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:48,000
A very realistic one, at that.

535
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,800
Didn't you say it before?

536
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:56,200
"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."

537
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,700
Please come out.

538
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:09,500
Come out, please.

539
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:12,300
Come out.

540
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:17,600
Let go. Let go, let go!

541
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,000
- I-Isn't that Kim Seon Ju right there?
- What? Where?

542
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,600
- It's Kim Seon Ju!
- It's really Kim Seon Ju!

543
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,000
He was announced ill...

544
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,700
It's him!

545
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:30,400
Does this mean you admit to the allegations?

546
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,000
I-It's a lie. I was set up.

547
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:36,200
I-I... I d-didn't do it.

548
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,400
I'm being framed! It's a setup.

549
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,800
Not true!

550
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:49,800
I used to take orders... from Executive Director Oh Mi Ran.

551
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,700
I'm now turning myself in.

552
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:57,200
It's a lie.

553
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:00,600
This man is framing me!

554
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:13,600
I really don't know anything!

555
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:16,700
I'm being framed!

556
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:18,600
It wasn't... It wasn't me!

557
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,500
It really wasn't me.

558
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:30,300
It's not only President Kim Seon Ju that Executive Director Oh Mi Ran harmed

559
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:34,400
her younger brother Oh Seung Won, Nam Sang Won, Kwak Sam Su,

560
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,000
and

561
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:40,600
even Jang Ju Seong.

562
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,600
To take over the chairman's position,

563
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:47,400
she did not hesitate to commit murder.

564
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,600
The evidence

565
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:52,300
is contained here.

566
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:54,900
Aigoo.

567
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:58,100
Who would've thought a day like this would come?

568
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:00,770
Oh Mi Ran,

569
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:05,690
I'm arresting you on allegations of instigating murder.

570
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:18,000
- Why did you run away?
- Please give us a word!

571
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,800
Does this mean you admit to the allegations?

572
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,600
Do you admit to allegations of instigating murder?

573
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,700
Please give us an explanation!

574
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:51,580
All right, let's move.

575
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:54,820
You may all start.

576
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:04,800
October 14th, one day after Silver Lining's President Park In Seong's shocking exposé,
[Prosecution search and seize Bumyoung HQ and 10-plus locations]

577
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:08,000
the prosecution, investigating Executive Director Oh Mi Ran and her instigating murder allegations,

578
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,000
extensively searched and seized 10-plus locations,

579
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
including Beomyeong HQ and Beomyeong Motors.

580
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,800
The prosecution's prompt search and seizure was made possible

581
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:21,200
because President Park In Seong had collected evidence that would prove

582
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:26,400
Executive Director Oh Mi Ran's allegations, with Detective Choi Seong Jun of Southern Seoul Police Precinct.

583
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,600
The prosecution stated that they plan to find evidence

584
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:34,500
of other cases concealed by Executive Director Oh Mi Ran through this search and seizure as well.

585
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:38,200
With an unprecedented crime of an owner family's murder,

586
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:41,000
domestic and foreign presses alike are covering the story,

587
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,800
leading to boycott movements within the nation and abroad.

588
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,900
The Beomyeong legacy, established on a single ramen,

589
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:48,600
fell to its doom like a sand castle.

590
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:52,000
Beomyeong more or less met its end.

591
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,800
The share price is decreasing by half each day.

592
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:58,800
It'll probably be dissolved gradually or

593
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:02,500
lead to a situation where they must hand over management rights

594
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:06,100
to a young professional management team.

595
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:10,100
Well, it's also a matter of time until they fall into receivership.

596
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:12,200
In fact, this controversy is so big

597
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:16,300
that there's no need to even rethink and analyze.

598
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:18,900
Murder, abandoning a corpse...

599
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:21,200
blackmailing, attempted concealment,

600
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,000
and abduction.

601
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,900
They're just out.

602
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:42,660
You did a great job.

603
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:48,000
I didn't do it alone. We did it together.

604
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,100
My mission is up to here.

605
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:53,400
It's what President Kim Seon Ju would've wished for, right?

606
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Why are you talking like that?

607
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,400
Like how we've been together so far,

608
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,400
lead Silver Lining to success and

609
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:06,600
be a good father figure to Min Ah as well

610
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:08,300
It's for Min Ah.

611
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:10,400
For me?

612
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,000
Yes.

613
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,600
At first,

614
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:17,000
I was worried about Min Ah getting hurt, so

615
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,500
I thought it'd be better for you not to know if possible.

616
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:23,160
But...

617
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:27,300
the more I thought about it, the more wrong it seemed.

618
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:30,600
Because it can be a bigger wound

619
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:33,950
to you as it gets delayed longer and longer.

620
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:40,000
I'm sorry for telling you a lie.

621
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,300
What lie?

622
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,000
Actually...

623
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:49,000
♫ I meant it from my heart ♫

624
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,600
Daddy, who's living inside the phone...

625
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,600
isn't really Daddy.

626
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,000
What?

627
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:01,200
It's an AI...

628
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:04,100
short for artificial intelligence.

629
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,300
What is that?

630
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,200
It's something like a computer that thinks and

631
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:16,000
talks like Min Ah's dad.

632
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,800
♫ I promise I'll love you ♫

633
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,400
♫ But in time, we're falling apart ♫

634
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:24,400
Then that's Daddy.

635
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:27,000
Unnie, where's Dad right now?

636
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,700
Dad, who is lying in bed.

637
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:31,900
Dad, who is inside a phone.

638
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:34,800
Even if it's okay for now,

639
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,800
as Min Ah grows older,

640
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,000
she'll be confused more and more.

641
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,400
One day,

642
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:46,300
there will also come a moment where she feels betrayed finding out I'm fake.

643
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:49,800
What Kim Seon Ju said was true.

644
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:52,100
An AI that grew feelings...

645
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:54,500
is just a mistake.

646
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:57,700
Nothing more than a critical bug.

647
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:01,000
Accordingly, a bug...

648
