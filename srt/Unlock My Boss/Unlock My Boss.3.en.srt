Do you want to start from the beginning?

44

I'm indeed Kim Seon Ju.

Then who would make a call like that?

49
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:27,330
The texts and the call both came from a restricted caller ID.

50

They are trying to hide their identity and probe you.
[Why are you not picking up? I'm the owner of that phone.]

They didn't expect me to end up like this either.

Both parties aren't aware of the card the other party holds

It's impossible usually,

but I can do it.

63
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:41,680
Oh, because you're a phone?

64
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,990
No, because I'm Kim Seon Ju.

What?

81
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:27,560
Residing at a hotel is risky. You could be bugged, or some outsider may trespass.

00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,930
Also, this place,

83

Could you open the door, please?

101
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,900
Hey.

102
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,450
You should take me out to dinner voluntarily for getting a job.

103
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,920
I have to grovel for it, don't I?

104
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,240
Why aren't you saying anything?

Hey.

112

Hey, don't mix it. Udon noodles are coming.

118

Go on with your story.

119
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,370
What happened to the phone?

120
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,930
So I'm saying...

121
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:26,470
a person...

122
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:28,720

123
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,810

125
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,910
Is that a new drama?

126
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:39,890
It sounds interesting. Where is it airing? I need to buy their shares.

127
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:42,300
Think about it seriously, please!

128
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,780
About what?

129
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:48,730
Why don't you just say you receive radio calls from the past and that the goblin lives with the Grim Reaper, huh?

130
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:51,170
Say something that makes sense.

131
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,240
Right?

132
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,120
It doesn't make sense, does it?

133
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,460
This guy, seriously.

134
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,280
So a person got trapped in a phone?

135
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,620
Here... I think someone's in here right now.

136
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,160
Are you there?

137
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,460
Are you trapped?

138
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:30,070
I last saw him when I said bye to him before he went to the campsite.

139
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,980
He didn't come to the campsite.

140
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:37,980
His phone suddenly stopped working.

141
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:43,380
Then only a text saying there's a project at the company came the next day, and now he can't be reached.

142
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:47,040
I also can't reach him.

143
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:52,540
You know the president would never do that.

144
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:56,080
He would never leave Min Ah alone.

145
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,870
Is there nothing that comes

146
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,980
to your mind, Secretary Jeong?

147
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,870
No, there's nothing.

148
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:57,370
You're late.

149
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:01,170
He kept asking to get one more drink,

150
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:03,840
so I barely managed to leave him behind.

151
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,780
There's one more reason to move to my house.

152
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,270
While the contract lasts,

153
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,850
you're forbidden from private hangouts.

154
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:11,330

156
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:20,570
While you were out, I notified Butler Shim and Ms. Ji Hye.

157
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:21,890
Already?

158
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,100
The problem is Min Ah.

159
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,800
Your daughter?

160
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,650
You wouldn't know because you've never raised children,

161
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:31,080
but it's not easy to get close to them.

162
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:36,500
Especially because Min Ah isn't the type to open up easily to others.

163
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:42,050
The Indian is after me!

164
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:43,260
Let's run away.

00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,310

- Somebody save Snow White!

166
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:46,980
Frog Prince!

167
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,230
Please help me, Prince!

168
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,150
Frog Prince!

169
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,900
Oh, gosh.

170
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:57,300
I got you!

171
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,440
It's really fun.

172
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,230
Do it again. One more time!

173
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:02,080
Is it fun?

174
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,950
Shall we do that?

175
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:05,270
You're one of a kind, Uncle.

176
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,100
Why?

177
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,860
Usually, Dad's friends give me pocket money first,

178
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,960
and his underlings compliment me first.

179
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:14,170
But you're the first one to play with me.

180
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:22,200
But, Min Ah, you shouldn't call someone an underling.

181
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,340
Why is that?

182
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:27,300
When it comes to people, no one is high or low.

183
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:30,100
Then what do I call them?

184
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,480
A coworker.

185
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,450
Then are you two coworkers, too?

186
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,960
Thank you for helping.

187
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,740
President Kim said Min Ah would open up

188
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:58,040
easily in your presence.

189
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,700
You can reach the president?

190
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:05,950
Sorry?

191
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:10,150
Do you also know where he is?

192
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:15,930
It's all finished!

193
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:18,330
You can use the study that President Kim used.

194
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,750
Okay.

195
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:26,650
I will just get my shoes.

196
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,780
How did you know the study is that way?

197
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,490
Sorry?

198
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:33,910
Oh...

199
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:39,680
I think I saw her come down from the second floor.

200
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,430
Am I wrong?

201
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:44,330
I'll guide you there. Let's go.

202
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:45,770
Okay.

203
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,680
Isn't it a bit strange?

204
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,550
Placing someone new next to Min Ah?

205
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:58,200
It's not like the president.

206
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,040
Did you get a call from the president?

207
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,220
Yes.

208
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:04,830
Could it be...

209
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:07,510
I have served him for decades.

210
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:09,760
The voice and the speech were all the same.

211
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,240
All the way down to his characteristic self-love?

212
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:17,000
It's confirmed then.

213
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,020
People can be startled by these things,

214
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,940
but I have nerves of steel.

215
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:31,010
- It's at the very end over there.
- Okay.

216
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:33,470
Wow, you're like a rabbit.

217
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:37,260
You can rest here.

218
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:40,200
I also replaced the bedding completely.

219
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,370
I'll count on your hospitality.

220
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:44,940
Oh my, how polite.

221
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,900
Let me know if you have a favorite side dish.

222
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,600
Okay. Thank you.

223
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,740
I'll see you out.

224
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:52,710
- No, it's okay. Please rest.
- I'll rest after you go.

225
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:54,440
Gosh, you're so polite, seriously.

226
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,900
No, not at all.

227
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:06,380
My Vroom Vroom!

228
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:09,200
Oh, you're back here.

229
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,800
I'm sorry.

230
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,860
I couldn't contact you beforehand.

231
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,870
Now, for the real game.

232
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,850
You can trace back the restricted caller ID now, right?

233
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,320
I can do it.

234
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,490
How long would it take?

235
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:39,530
It's a matter of time.

236
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:44,910
You can start.

237
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,580
Are you super busy at work?

238
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,170
Yes.

239
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:57,490
He didn't even say bye this time.

240
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,940
Dad is so mean.

241
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:00,990
He's busy.

242
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:04,090
Please tell him I'm upset when you see him at work.

243
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,660
Okay?

244
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,160
Okay.

245
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,610
Shall we go?

246
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:35,810
We'll start the preliminary selection for Beomyeong Dragons.

247
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:38,950
Try choosing one of them.

248
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,490
I don't know anything about baseball.

249
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:48,100
It's okay.

250
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,170
It doesn't matter whom you choose,

251
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:54,280
what's important is who makes the choice.

252
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:02,500
Choose when you can.

253
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,250
[Park Seung Hyeon]

254
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:12,490
I'll choose that person.
[Jeong Hyeon Jae]

255
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:42,110
Beomyeong Dragons chooses Jeong Hyeon Jae,

256
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,920
the infielder from Gilcheon High School,

257
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,950
as its first choice.

258
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:51,480
Wow, Beomyeong Dragons made an unexpected choice.

259
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:56,040
I'm also curious about the same thing as you, Secretary Jeong.

260
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,160
Why did Kim Seon Ju

261
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:01,770
choose Park In Seong?

262
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:09,090
Please keep an eye on President Park.

263
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,270
E-Excuse me, my mom– I mean...

264
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:34,980
where did patient Lee Jeong Yeon go?

265
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,650
Oh, you're the daughter, right?

266
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:40,410
Didn't you know?

267
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,900
Wow, all the channels work.

268
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,950
My goodness.

269
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:00,400
Were you actually this capable?

270
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,090
Wow...

271
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:06,480
It's really nice.
[Ms. Lee Jeong Yeon, get well soon! Beomyeong Hospital Director Oh Chang Muk]

272
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:12,200
Your mother is receiving long-term care at Beomyeong Hospital, right?

273
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,730
I know

274
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:19,940
better than anyone about that sorrow.

275
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:37,100
Please keep an eye on President Park.

276
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,440
[Danger! Beware of falling]

277
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:51,240
In Seong, wake up, please.

278
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,060
In Seong, wake up, please.

279
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,930
In Seong, wake–

280
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,270
To your feet!

281
00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:00,040
Why? What now?

282
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,330
Am I late?

283
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:03,750
Ba-ba-ba-ba-bam.

284
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,790
I found a way.

285
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:08,380
Tracing it?

286
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:11,930
Who is it? Do you know the person? Is it Butler Shim?

287
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:14,500
- Or Director Kwak?
 - Well...

288
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:21,560
It's one billion won if we just catch him, right?

289
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,940
Looking back...

290
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:28,500
they were days of agony.

291
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,200
How is it, babe? Is it delicious?

292
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,500
Oppa, it's really delicious.

293
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,560
You're Park In Seong, right?

294
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,650
No, I'm not.

295
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:43,830
I worked really hard to live.

296
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,630
Yes?

297
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:51,560
Wow... Oppa?

298
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,110
Please leave a review.

299
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:00,990
Other people have things working out for them.

300
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:01,980
Great!

301
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,210
Look straight ahead once,

302
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:06,870
Bride and Groom exchange eye contact.

303
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:09,390
Okay, great.

304
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:10,890
Hey, reflector plate!

305
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:13,290
You need to reflect it against her face.

306
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:14,670
Please don't mind him.

307
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:17,090
- The pictures are great.
- I felt...

308
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:19,910
like the only one running in circles.

309
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:22,930
But now, I don't have to hide.

310
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,630
With one billion won, I'll buy an apartment first.

311
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:28,340
I'll first buy an apartment in Seoul and–

312
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,430
You can't buy it.

313
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:34,380
Nowadays, you can't buy a new apartment in Seoul with one billion.

314
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:40,180
Nevertheless, if you want to get at least a billion, listen carefully.

315
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:42,030
I couldn't find out the number, but

316
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:45,560
I can trace it and make a call.

317
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:49,800
What use is that? If they don't pick up, that'll be it.

318
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,410
Instead, if you call when everyone is there,

319
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:54,810
the perp's phone will ring.

320
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:58,010
You know there is a board meeting at the HQ today, right?

321
00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:01,590
All internal foes and external targets we need to be cautious of will be there.

322
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:04,490
You can't miss that chance.

323
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:14,510
Gosh, how can you not trust the board members?

324
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:17,890
Isn't this too much?

325
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:20,640
Are we in elementary school? Telling us to turn in our phones, seriously?

326
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,600
Really now.

327
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:28,220
Do you think being the new boss is everything?

328
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,270
All phones have been collected.

329
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,880
Okay.

330
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:43,320
Nowadays, a phone is not just a phone.

331
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:47,260
It's as good as your everyday recorders and wires.

332
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:49,900
Being the board members of Beomyeong Electronics,

333
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:54,000
I believe you'll understand the security measures.

334
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,620
To live up to the standards of Capo 21, we have reformed the environment if which memory development takes place.

335
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:03,100
We have thus enhanced energy efficiency using extreme UV waves for the first time ever in the field.

336
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,550
Including products and processes such as CIS and DI,

337
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:09,220
I did as you told me to, but...

338
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:12,370
will it really be in there?

339
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:15,390
I can start checking now.

340
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:31,720
If one of those phones rings...

341
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,480
The owner of that phone is the culprit?

342
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:38,430
We'll know once we ask the owner.

344
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:44,640
There really is one.

345
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,760
The name. Please check the name.

347
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,720
The Vice Chairman has arrived.

348
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:23,950
Are you the temporary president?

349
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:25,440
Pleased to meet you.

350
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,410
I'm President Park In Seong of Silver Lining.

351
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:30,370
I'm Oh Yeong Geun.

352
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,310
Ouch...

353
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:40,380
You've got great strength.

354
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,000
Is that so?

355
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,070
It was worth my effort not to become an old geezer.

356
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:49,580
If the meeting's over, let's have some tea.

357
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,730
W-Wait, you can't take them yet.

358
00:24:56,730 --> 00:25:00,260
You can't just take them...

359
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:17,000
It disappeared?

360
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,300
Yes.

361
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:21,260
Thanks to the Vice Chairman appearing,

362
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:23,610
everyone took their phones then.

363
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:26,650
The post-it wasn't attached to begin with...

364
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,170
Is this a coincidence?

365
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,170
For the Vice Chairman to come in at that moment?

366
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:35,790
Did Vice Chairman do it intentionally to save someone?

367
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:38,930
Well, that is what happened due to it.

368
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,980
If true, he's a really scary person.

369
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:46,800
Will I really be able to do well in front of that person?

370
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,900
I can't even get your help without the earphones on.

371
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:55,900
Now I can tell why you failed the interview.

372
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:56,940
Sorry?

373
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,470
It's because you don't trust yourself.

374
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:01,160
Why would someone else place their trust in you?

375
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:04,190
The vice chairman is looking for you.

376
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,470
Okay.

It's inside. That way.

380
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,070
Okay.

381
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,100
I can do it.

I can do it.

Ready...

384
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:01,230
Action!

385
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:07,920
I wondered who the nepotism hire by the renowned Kim Seon Ju was.

386
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:11,620
I was also curious about you.

387
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:14,080
Okay.

388
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,300
Your father's name?

389
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:22,240
In this field, everyone is a bridge away from each other.

390
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,520
His name is Park Jae Chun.

391
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,130
He owns an orchard.

392
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:27,830
An orchard?

393
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:36,600
Where did you work before coming here?

394
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,930
I was seeking a job while working part-time.

395
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:45,720
Oh, I heard they call it job-seeking nowadays.

396
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:50,940
Young people are just looking for convenient and easy jobs,

397
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:54,350
without a dream or ambition.

398
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:58,070
It wasn't like that in my days.

399
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:02,000
Isn't it the old generation who made that kind of world?

400
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Because they taught us that the world is unfair early on.

401
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:12,080
Do you know what the really unfair thing is?

402
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:16,150
It's that you dare to take the seat of the president of Beomyeong group,

403
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:21,500
when you've never even run a corner store.

404
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:26,490
My son and his friends received management classes from birth,

405
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:29,350
trying to seat in that place once.

406
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:31,400
They are all alone studying overseas.

407
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:35,240
Even now, they worry about the employees,

408
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,210
whose livelihoods depend on an approval of theirs.

409
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,880
Just because one's father is an Olympics gold medalist,

410
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,330
doesn't mean that the father will send his son out to the Olympics too.

411
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:46,580
What did you say?

412
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:49,260
A son also receiving management rights

413
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,500
just because his father was good at management.

414
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,150
That's what is really unfair.

415
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:58,490
I've never received any early education or privileges.

416
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:00,910
I vacuumed the house without a housekeeper.

417
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:03,860
I don't have a chauffeur. I ride the bus and use my phone.

what people like me find inconvenient in our daily lives and

420
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:12,130
what kind of technology is the need of the hour.

421
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:17,250

You're like him.

424
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:30,590
Is it because President Kim recruited you?

425
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:33,560
You're full of confidence.

426
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,170
However,

427
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:41,700
President Kim at least took responsibility for his words.

428
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:46,400
Wait, is he always that rude?

429
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,190
Whom? Are we talking about you, In Seong?

430
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:50,860
You must've heard everything through the phone.

431
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,500
How does it matter what my father does?

432
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,610
Vice Chairman is Silver Lining's business partner.

433
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:58,990
It means you have to keep seeing his face.

434
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:01,920
I'm sorry. I should've held back.

435
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:05,820
He makes it hard for a person to hold back.

436
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:06,800
Right?

437
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:10,000
It's not three strikes, right? Nor a dissolution of contract?

Check Director Kwak and Secretary Jung's phone models when you return to your office.

Even Se Yeon? Didn't we agree to trust her?

440
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:19,950
Those two were closest to the phone collection box during the meeting.

441
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:21,830
How long were you standing there?

442
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:23,370
Is your meeting over?

443
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:24,730

444
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,840
Yes.

445
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:43,830
Could Se Yeon have heard me?

446
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,770
Should I try probing her?

447
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:52,180
Don't do anything rash.

448
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,200
Oh, it's my cellphone.

He's a busy child.

452
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,590
He will call you on his own.

453
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:31,740
I called him first because he's isn't!

454
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:34,320
He is the only son we have,

455
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,260
yet he can't match up to this guy.

456
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,950
Baro.

457
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:39,990
Yes, did you call me?

458
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:44,800
Play Sir Cho Yong Pil's "Hate, Hate, Hate."

459
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,780
All right.

460
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:48,990
I'll play "Hate, Hate, Hate."

461
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,600
You have two cell phones.

462
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:55,640
One is for work,

463
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,650
and one is personal.

464
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:59,320

465
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:02,730
if the phone in your pocket is "my cell phone,"

466
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:06,830
whose phone is the one you're holding?

467
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:10,000
This is my cell phone, too.

468
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,290
You're always wearing wireless earphones,

469
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:15,440
and in situations where you can't,

470
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,760
you clutch onto the phone.

471
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:22,880
As if you need to report back to someone constantly.

472

What are you doing?

474
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:37,070
Se Yeon, what are you doing?

475
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,110

Tell you what?

479
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:18,500
You're Kim Seon Ju's abductor, aren't you?

480
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:21,700
Or are you his murderer?

481
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,390

00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:28,240
What?

498
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,520
Was it Se Yeon's?

499
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:33,100
Why did you make a restricted call,

500
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:36,480
and what did you want to find out that you sent that text?

501
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:40,590
Deliver every single word. Hurry!

502
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:47,180
It's not Se Yeon.

503
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:51,550
Would someone who's risking their life for you,

504
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:53,090
have hurt you?

505
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:55,430
What are you saying?

506
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:57,660
Who are you talk–

507
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:06,990
As you said, he's childish.

508
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:10,300
He turns out to be twenty-nine years old.

509
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:13,080
Yes, he's just a rookie.

510
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:16,710
He's not someone worth worrying over.

511
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:20,820
Kim Seon Ju doesn't have an eye for people, either.

512
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:22,900
If Silver Lining wavers,

513
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:26,000
neither Beomyeong Auto nor Executive Director Oh will be left unscathed.

514
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,380
- If it ends up that way–
- What about you?

515
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:30,300
Sorry?

516
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:33,300
Regarding Silver Lining.

517
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:36,210
Have you worked for me for about twenty years?

518
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:40,600
Yes, it's been twenty-two years and three months since Beomyeong Electronics days.

519
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:44,880
It's about time you took a high position.

520
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:54,900
On Saturday, schedule a luncheon with President Park.

521
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,440
Pardon?

522
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:59,500
We must give him a proper welcome to the Beomyeong family.

523
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:02,460
He is part of Beomyeong now.

524
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:15,230
No way.

525
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:21,430
President Kim was attacked and trapped in a cell phone?

526
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:27,360
I don't think Se Yeon believes us yet.

527
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:32,100
If we show her a 100 million won deposit into my account like last time–

528
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,680
What In Seong is saying is true.

529
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,500
This voice...

530
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:44,400
Yes, it's me, Kim Seon Ju.

531
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:46,850
Where are you right now?

532
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:50,750
Somewhere between the CPU and GPU chip.

533
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:55,780
But President Kim once said

534
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:59,370
that a voice can easily be mimicked by an AI.

535
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:01,290
What about the promise?

536
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,070
Do you remember the first day you ever asked me for a favor?

537
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:08,630
And I made a promise.

538
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,200
How do you...

539
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,700
I want to keep that promise.

540
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,890
When did you take this?

541
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:29,050
If you had told me, I could've gotten a better angle of her face.

542
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:31,800
How about giving her a call at least?

543
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,770
She must be waiting for you.

544
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:37,820
How should I explain,

545
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:39,800
this situation?

546
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:48,830
I can't even tell her when I'll be back.

547
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:53,900
Giving half-hearted hope only inflicts a greater hurt.

548
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:56,870
It's hard.

549
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:03,100
Se Yeon must be very confused right now, too.

550
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:13,000
By the way, what promise did you make Se Yeon?

551
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:20,390
♫ On my way back, leaning on the bus window ♫

552
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:28,360
♫ My day that was hectic ♫

553
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:32,800
♫ It's just exhausting and gloomy ♫

554
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:44,810
♫ Oh stars, you are hidden by the light of the world and the moon ♫

555
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:49,200
♫ Shine on me brightly ♫

556
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,010
Secretary Jeong,

557
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,010
we should go.

558
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:55,470
Oh, I'm sorry.

559
00:38:56,910 --> 00:39:02,120
♫ Don't say anything and just hold me ♫

560
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,910
President Kim.

561
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:08,830
♫ Just as if you knew my feelings ♫

562
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:16,240
♫ Look at me and cry as if your heart will explode ♫

563
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:22,230
♫ So that everything is forgotten ♫

564
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:46,290
Who are you?

565
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,940
Where is the living corpse that was here?

566
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:54,690
Who are you talking about?

567
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:58,810
F***.

568
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:04,800
Will she come?

569
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,400
She'll come, right?

570
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,500
Come on.

571
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,490
Be patient, okay?

572
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:15,050
She's here!

573
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:25,290
Se Yeon! I'm glad you came.

574
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:29,980
There is a weekly report from the development team at 9:10 a.m. today.

575
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:32,750
Really? Then hop in,

576
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:34,400
Se Yeon.
(*Pun. The end of the sentence and her name sounds the same)

577
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,350
This.

578
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:45,000
What is this?

579
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
A wireless earphone.

580
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,740
We're on the same team now.

581
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,900
It's not that side.

582
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:18,710
What are you doing?

583
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,800
Sorry?

584
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,600
Get in the back, not the passenger seat.

585
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,400
You're still the president at work.

586
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,800
Okay, Se Yeon.

587
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,400
I mean, Secretary Jeong.

588
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,200
Shall we at least turn on the radio?

589
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,200
Which channel do you want to listen to?

590
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,200
I mean, it's just too quiet.

591
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,000
Were the rides with President Kim like this, too?

592
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,400
- It only makes sense to avoid focusing on something else when driving.
- Yes.

593
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,200
Yes, it only makes sense to avoid focusing on something else when driving.

594
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,200
Wh-What the heck?

595
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,400
You two must've worked together for a long time.

596
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,900
Yes.

597
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,800
If someone asks this question, don't they usually

598
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,200
recount the number of years too?

599
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,000
What about you?

600
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,600
Sorry?

601
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:30,000
Oh, well...

602
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,500
Well...

603
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,800
President Kim and me?

604
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,700
Well...

605
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:39,000
I'll put it in simple terms.

606
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:45,000
In dramas, you know the commoner who gets entangled with the wealthy?

607
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,200
I play the role of the commoner.

608
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,900
So you're strangers.

609
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,400
How could he trust someone like him?

610
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,800
Since I couldn't trust Secretary Jeong, either.

611
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,000
I have no memory of what happened before or after the accident.

612
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,200
So naturally, Secretary Jeong, who was with me, became a strong suspect.

613
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:07,000
No, I wasn't with you.

614
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:10,200
Let's hurry.

615
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,100
Min Ah is waiting.

616
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:23,000
I got a text from the hospital
[You should come quickly. Your mom is in critical condition.]

617
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,800
that my mom was in critical condition.

618
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,600
Could I go to Seoul instead?

619
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,970
You're here.

620
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:41,100
Fortunately, she was stable by the time I arrived.

621
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,800
Texts, call history, and even her GPS locations,

622
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,200
everything adds up to what Se Yeon said.

623
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:10,300
The opposite of doubt is not believing blindly but knowing for sure.

624
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:11,400
So I–

625
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,800
You can just say you're sorry.

626
00:44:15,010 --> 00:44:17,410
We are sorry for suspecting you.

627
00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:21,360
No, no.

628
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,770
No, no... no!

629
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,400
I suspected you, too.

630
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,100
That's why... with the restricted call...

631
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:31,900
You don't need to explain.

632
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:34,000
I fully understand.

633
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,200
So far, my last confirmed location is a golf course.

634
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,300
Did something unusual happen there?

635
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:42,000
Even something trivial.

636
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,400
Or was there something out of the ordinary?

637
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:47,010
Nothing happened, really.

638
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,200
What do you think, President Kim?

639
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:52,400
Well, I think it's only natural to have a meeting

640
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:56,000
in a meeting room instead of a golf course.

641
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,900
Okay, sounds great.

642
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:03,200
Hey, on a good day like this,

643
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:07,000
it's hard to follow around people playing hooky, right?

644
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,200
No, it's my job.

645
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,600
What are you doing after?

646
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:14,200
It's Fri-yay.

647
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,600
I thought he was just asking.

648
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:19,000
It didn't feel like he had other intentions.

649
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:24,400
But if someone really intended on murdering me that night...

650
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:27,400
They would've tried to get Secretary Jeong to leave your side.

651
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:32,300
Director Kwak has no hair, but he is very ambitious.

652
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:40,770
And he's adept at concealing and hiding that greed.

653
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,500
We can't overlook a single detail about where he went,

654
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,600
who he met and what he did

655
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:53,400
after playing golf that day.

656
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:11,800
Please give me the money first.

657
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,900
This is your phone, right?

658
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,600
[First aid activity log]
[Reporter: Unidentified; Phone number: 010-0417-7036]

00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:32,600

- Self-driving cars? Yes.
- "Self-driving cars?"

824
00:57:46,790 --> 00:57:49,970
- "Yes. They do get into accidents."
 - They do get into accidents.

825
00:57:50,790 --> 00:57:53,470
"But accidents happen even when people drive."

826
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:57,160
- Are you aware that people are more likely to get into accidents
- "Are you aware that people are"

827
00:57:57,160 --> 00:58:02,230
- than self-driving cars?
- "more likely to get into accidents than self-driving cars?"

828
00:58:02,230 --> 00:58:05,880
- And self-driving cars at least don't 
- "And self-driving cars at least"

829
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,570
- do drunken or drowsy driving.
- "don't do drunken"

830
00:58:07,570 --> 00:58:10,400
"or drowsy driving."

831
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:20,010
The accident rate is low because it's just in its early stages.

832
00:58:20,010 --> 00:58:22,330
- If self-driving cars get more commercialized—
- That's right.

833
00:58:22,330 --> 00:58:25,610
- So you admit self-driving cars are the trend of the time?
- "That's right. So you at least admit"

834
00:58:25,610 --> 00:58:27,910
"self-driving cars are the trend of the time?"

835
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:31,930
Then

836
00:58:31,930 --> 00:58:33,270
"Then"

837
00:58:33,270 --> 00:58:34,540
shall we rewind a bit

838
00:58:34,540 --> 00:58:37,900
- "shall we rewind a bit"
- and think back to when there were horse wagons?

839
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:40,160
"and think back to when there were horse wagons?"

840
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:43,490
That is when cars came out for the first time in the world.

841
00:58:43,490 --> 00:58:45,710
Immense speed.

842
00:58:45,710 --> 00:58:48,610
The overwhelming presence of hard steel.

843
00:58:48,610 --> 00:58:52,100
People probably felt fear.

844
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:55,940
Some journalist probably asked the same question then.

845
00:58:55,940 --> 00:58:57,190
"A car?"

846
00:58:57,190 --> 00:58:58,230
"It's too dangerous!"

847
00:58:58,230 --> 00:59:01,460
"Let's just ride horse wagons!"

848
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:03,760
He talks just like President Kim Seon Ju.

849
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:06,360
I know. He sounds the same.

850
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:14,930
So what if we kept riding horse wagons?

851
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:18,210
What would've happened to our society?

852
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:24,600
Then if one can't go against the course of time,

853
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:26,710
I think Silver Lining's job is

854
00:59:26,710 --> 00:59:28,720
not to worry, but

855
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:32,430
to create technology that can be acknowledged.

856
00:59:34,730 --> 00:59:36,670
In Seong.

857
00:59:36,670 --> 00:59:38,470
In Seong–

858
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:56,110
President Kim?

859
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:20,980
President of the renowned Silver Lining can't be using a rival company's products.

860
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:25,010
The entire nation is watching.

861
01:00:34,390 --> 01:00:37,790
Now, everyone, ask your questions.

[Unlock My Boss]

876
01:01:30,470 --> 01:01:31,790
I'll be sure to pay you back.

877
01:01:31,790 --> 01:01:34,180
- Are you threatening me right now?
- Vice Chairman!

878
01:01:34,180 --> 01:01:35,620
I'll show up before you guys again.

879
01:01:35,620 --> 01:01:37,560
And I won't go back nicely like today.

880
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:41,060
Who do you think you're? What do you know to be judging me?

881
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:44,130
I heard Dad's voice.

882
01:01:44,130 --> 01:01:45,960
Oh, no!

883
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:48,270
P-President Kim? The president will be fine, right?

884
01:01:48,270 --> 01:01:50,470
Don't trust Kim Seon Ju too much.

885
01:01:50,470 --> 01:01:51,650
There's no other way.

886
01:01:51,650 --> 01:01:53,680
I'll catch the person who did this to President Kim.

887
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:55,010
I'll confirm it.

888
01:01:55,010 --> 01:01:56,050
I haven't seen that car around.

889
01:01:56,050 --> 01:01:59,610
You have a trustworthy guy on him, right?
