00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,350
Even if he did come, he didn't talk.

168
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:39,200
He never came to the after-party. Not even once.

169
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,460
I thought he must really love hiking.

170
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,460
I see.

171
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,900
Why do you ask?

172
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:48,660
Something happened to Mr. Nam, right?

173
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,500
I heard he doesn't even come to work these days.

174
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,070
No, it's nothing.

Aigoo, the sun is up at this place.

177
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:05,580
What a vast country we have.

178
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:08,670
You seem to be happy, Sir.

179
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:11,060
I guess so.

180
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,570
I was sad about getting old every year, but

181
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:18,990
I've never looked forward to the new year like these days.

182
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:21,950
Do you mean the end-of-the-year shareholders' meeting?

183
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,740
Congratulations in advance.

184
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:26,650
Congratulations for what? No need.

185
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:45,340
I hereby declare that I'll build the largest domed stadium in the country in this place.

186
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,720
Because following Beomyeong's value

187
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:53,220
of "better life for Korea" instead of pursuing profits...

188
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,930
is the last teaching left to me by my late father.

189
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:59,800
I mean,

190
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,740
a corporation needs to make money. Why do you need a domed stadium?

191
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,510
Let her be.

192
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:09,040
It'll be my niece's decisive mistake.

193
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:15,960
I'd like to disclose another teaching left behind by the previous chairman.

00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:42,030
will be launched on this year's National Foundation Day.

198
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,270
I couldn't notify you beforehand for security reasons.

199
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:53,440
I apologize.

200
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,730
It's not ready yet.

201
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:57,610
Just launch it by National Foundation Day.

He showed up after three months at different times.

205
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:22,490
Gosh, at this rate, we can't figure out why Mr. Nam went to the hiking club.

206
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:24,380
Not at all.

207
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:28,370
There is a rule between those dates.

Executive Director Oh is trying to gain an advantage in the share fight by hurriedly launching the self-driving car

- Who doesn't know that?

My apologies.

211
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:43,490
Even in President Kim Seon Ju's absence,

212
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:47,910
can they prepare Baro 4.0?

213
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,980
There is no way.

[Attendance Sheet]

215
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,710
What's the rule?

216
00:14:56,710 --> 00:15:01,840
Those dates fall in the weeks when Baro 4.0's beta testing reports came out.

217
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:06,350
Pretending to be hiking, he leaked the results to someone?

218
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:10,280
It's a hypothesis, but they probably met naturally since they're in the same hiking club.

219
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:13,160
Since there are no CCTVs on the mountain either.

220
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:19,440
Who could he possibly have been meeting?

221
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,690
A person waiting for Baro 4.0's development.

222
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:34,330
A person trying to prevent Baro 4.0's development.

It's the information everyone needs.

Thanks to your arranging the shareholders' meeting that day,

Take a look at this, please.

228
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,270
Did you find something?

229
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:08,250
On the days when Mr. Nam went out to the hiking club, Director Kwak also attended without fail.

230
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,310
Director Kwak,

231
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:31,390
do you want to have some cold noodles before we go?

232
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:41,090
I must've chosen the menu too selfishly.

233
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:46,070
It's okay. I also like Pyeongyang cold noodles*.
(Cold noodles in beef broth in North Korean style)

234
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:50,280
Isn't it too bland and without flavor?

235
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,210
Would you like some vinegar or something?

236
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:53,960
N-No, it's okay. I'm okay.

237
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,180
- Come on.
- It's okay.

238
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,670
I should've sat down with you way sooner.

239
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:02,700
I was tactless.

240
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:07,870
You're working day and night, trying to hire talented individuals.

241
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:10,710
Well, that's my job.

242
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,040
Well, so

243
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:16,210
where could Mr. Nam be right now?

244
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,510
Who did you say?

245
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:27,060
Mr. Nam Sang Won of the Sales Department.

246
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:30,800
He was absent without notice for the past few days.

247
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,740
Is this all you have?

248
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:50,990
I'm sure you get paid a lot!

249
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:53,900
It's not like Silver Lining is a small corner shop.

250
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:57,130
I can't be aware of what every little employee does.

251
00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:00,030
No, I'm sure you know him.

252
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,900
You even attended the hiking club with him.

253
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,290
Haven't I told you before?

254
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:06,950
I'm a goose father.

255
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:11,940
I was lonely during the weekend, so I only attended a few meetings.

256
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:15,130
By the way, though,

257
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:22,280
Mr. Nam coincidentally attended the hiking club only when you attended as well, Director Kwak.

258
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,600
I'm not sure.

259
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,510
I don't even know the dates

260
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:29,740
when I attended.

261
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:32,050
Please do your best to remember.

262
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,470
We also have things we heard from Mr. Nam.

263
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:40,990
I'm not sure what you heard from whom, but...

264
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:44,350
cornering me without any evidence like this...

265
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:46,760
I honestly find it unpleasant.

266
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:57,770
Okay, enjoy your food.

267
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,450
My daughter!

268
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:16,670
Are you on a date with Mom?

269
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:18,260
Yes, we're buying some clothes.

270
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,680
It's Dad.

271
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,580
I told you to eat properly even if it's cumbersome.

272
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:25,710
No, I had a quick meal just today.

273
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:27,790
What's going on, though? At this hour?

274
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:29,250
Nothing's going on.

275
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,590
I called because I wanted to see my family.

276
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:34,780
Dad, can I buy tickets to the BTS concert?

277
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:37,980
They came to New York this time, but the tickets were a bit expensive.

278
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,440
Sure, buy them.

279
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,620
Don't worry about it.

280
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:43,170
I'm an executive at Beomyeong.

281
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:48,390
You do everything you want there and see everything you want to see–

282
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:50,690
Dad, I'm sorry. I'm getting a call from a friend.

283
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:53,110
- I'll call you later.
- M-Min Ju.

284
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:55,490
Gosh, that girl...

285
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,550
Aigoo, daddy is her lowest priority.

286
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:02,400
Aigoo.

287
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:08,210
When will you be coming to Korea?

288
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:24,760
Director Kwak claimed he didn't know anything with a straight face.

289
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,590
I need an ISE.

290
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:28,550
Are you guys detectives?

291
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:30,190
Evidence, my ass.

292
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:32,230
You only need to hang him.

293
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,670
Do you want to hear another confession?

294
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:36,060
I'm sure that's how you've always been.

295
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:38,350
You're not even a human.

296
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:40,930
What?

297
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:45,580
I'm saying we'll be locked up if we act on him rashly.

298

W-Wow, a car!

Gosh, where is my head?

300
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:59,830
I-I forgot something...

301
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:03,260
We became one team. We should at least have our first staff dinner.

302
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,400
Here you go.

303
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,550
The entrees will come out soon.

304
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:15,320
Okay, thank you.

305
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,810
Cheers.

306
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:31,010
Shouldn't it be a given that a bodyguard doesn't drink?

307
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:33,600
Do I need to tell you even these things?

308
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,490
W-Well,

309
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,500
since work hours are over...

310
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:55,440
Work hours are over? Then I'll be taking my leave first.

311
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,390
Gosh, it's nice!

312
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,730
Se Yeon!

313
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:08,160
It must be so nice to be a good person, In Seong.

314
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,960
Forgiving and making up so easily.

315
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,330
I'm sorry, but I can't do that.

316
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,380
Wait–

317
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,750
President Kim, I can't do this.

318
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,780
If you're the one who brought in a person like him,

319
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:37,330
then you should've been prepared

320
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:39,320
for this much, at least.

321
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:43,360
Relationships with other people are always the hardest thing.

322
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,120
That's right.

323
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,460
However, I'm not the one best suited for working out relationships,

324
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,510
you are, In Seong.

325
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,870
I mean, that's true.

326
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:13,390
Excuse me... could I get it to go?

327
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:16,540

00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,930
I also got my first pay.

494
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:25,730
Hey, my Beomyeong Car shares also went to the moon.

495
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,510
Okay, then, but I'm buying the food.

496
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:28,900
Okay.

497
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:32,590
Hey, let's also buy them some clothes so they can stop wearing baggy pants.

498
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:33,970
Sounds great!

499
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:36,450
We lack swag but not money, right?

500
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:38,050
We also have swag.

501
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:39,430
Okay!

502
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:41,650
Yes!

503
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:11,540
Hello, how may I help you?

504
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:14,130
From here to there.

505
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:16,050
Please wrap them all up.

506
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:18,020
Thank you!

507
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,200
Baby, let's go!

508
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,120
Love?

509
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:33,700
Don't make me laugh. I'll buy it with money now.

510
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,180
I'll just have to buy it with money.

511
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,580
How much will it take?

512
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:38,650
How much do you want?

513
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:45,250
What's wrong with you?

514
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:48,740
What were you thinking for your face to turn red?

515
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:50,710
You're suspicious.

516
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:53,300
It's nothing. L-Let's go.

517
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,950
In Seong, In Seong!

518
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:03,410
I feel like someone keeps following us.

519
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:04,570
Whom?

520
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:05,920
The suit toward the four o'clock direction.

521
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,220
Don't look back and act natural.

522
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:10,380
Oh, he's my bodyguard.

523
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:12,130
Oh, the bodyguard.

524
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:15,460
Wow...

525
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:25,410
This is a little small.

526
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:28,010
I don't think you're supposed to wear it there...

527
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:56,310
I can't keep addressing you, "excuse me, hello, or hey."

528
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:59,740
What should I call you?

529
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:02,480
No need to exchange names.

530
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,530
They call him Mapi.

531
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,210
Mapi?

532
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:10,880
Are you a mafia?

533
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,600
The legendary fists that even destroyed his opponents' mouthpieces.

534
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,490
That's why they call him Mapi.

535
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:21,530
He was a promising boxer who was also a young national athlete,

536
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:25,710
but now he's a loan shark with three criminal records, including assault and blackmailing.

537
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:33,060
If you were going to throw it in my face anyway, why did you bother with a background check?

538
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:41,810
I needed to fact-check it myself.

539
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:46,800
If you run your trap without care, I'll have four criminal records.

540
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,300
That's what you call a fact.

541
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:55,080
Wow, it's a balloon.

542
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,530
How do you do that?

543
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:01,830
Gosh, so hideous.

544
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:04,750
She'll get scared if you stare at her with a rugged face.

545
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,610
You should smile for a child.

546
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:09,370
Gosh, how can a person be like that?

547
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:20,760
My, my. My goodness.

548
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,140
C-Come here.

549
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,900
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm okay.

550
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,260
- Oh, my.
- He's not scary at all.

551
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,600
He's like Ha Seung from the Joy Classroom.

552
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,820
He teases me and takes my snacks every day,

553
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:35,310
but the teacher said he's doing it because he likes me.

554
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:45,250
Here.

555
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:46,990
What's this for?

556
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:49,900
It's just a shirt for you.

557
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:54,490
Why would you give me this?

558
00:38:57,130 --> 00:38:59,910
In Seong, c-could it be that...

559
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,560
you threw out the shirt I gave you?

560
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,240
You didn't need to buy a new one.

561
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,290
I also threw out your shirt.

562
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:16,640
I didn't think we'd meet again.

563
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:20,460
- I see...
- Secretary Jeong.

564
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:23,030
What time was the VR seminar again?

565
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:26,060
It's two o'clock at Daejeon Expo Plaza.

566
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:29,030
In Seong, please go there in my place.

567
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:31,570
If it's in Daejeon, could I stop by my parents' house after?

568
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:33,250
Sure. You can do that.

569
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:49,800
You came all this way, so why don't you come inside with me?

570
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,800
No thanks.

571
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,550
When I was buying the gifts, Mapi...

572
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:03,560
A-Anyway, I bought one for you, too.

573
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,260
It's a wristwatch.

574
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:12,520
I saw that you were using a watch for many purposes back then.

575
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,610
I bought one with strong durability.

576
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:17,740
I hope you like it.

577
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,040
My goodness!

578
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,940
It's the purple dress I like.

579
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,310
My goodness.

580
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:07,850
You always wear the same clothes every day, Mom.

581
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:09,920
Oh, my. You picked a good one.

582
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:13,390
Father, you like premium Korean beef.

583
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:18,150
You just have plenty of money to throw away, right?

584
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:21,770
This is how you become an idiot by wasting money like this left and right.

585
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:23,820
He said he bought it since it was his first pay.

586
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:24,660
What?

587
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:29,480
You need to save every penny since you started out later than others.

588
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,800
What?

589
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,100
Why do you keep comparing him with other people?

590
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:38,030
Should I compare Jo Yong Pil and Lee Yong then?

591
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:40,480
You just try!

592
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,250
I'm confident.

593
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:46,030
- How could you...
- Father!

594
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:49,880
- Here you go.
- What's that?

595
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,730
Glasses?

596
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:57,760
Is it a declaration of war or something, telling me to open my eyes correctly?

597
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,260
Come on, it's not like that. Geez...

598
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:02,650
Try them on first.

599
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:03,570
Forget it.

600
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:05,030
Geez, don't be like that.

601
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:06,520
- Why do I need glasses?
- Come on!

602
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,760
- It'll look good on you.
- I don't need

603
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,570
- glasses.
- Come on.

604
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:19,350
Honey?

605
00:42:19,350 --> 00:42:21,060
W-Wait, what are you–

606
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:25,180
Baro, please play Jo Yong Pil's Mona Lisa.

607
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:57,390
Oh, my! Darling!
♫ Even if I give you my all ♫

608
00:42:57,390 --> 00:43:02,070
- Over there...
- What?
♫ Can't I catch that heart? ♫

609
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:03,280
Oh, my!

610
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,000
♫ You without a smile ♫

611
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,760
Honey! Honey!

612
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,720
♫ You are the Mona Lisa ♫

613
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,030
Honey, what's wrong with you?

614
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:11,580
Honey, Honey!

615
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:14,610
♫ With a sad look ♫

616
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:15,730
♫ Should I look and turn around? ♫

617
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:17,680
Sir! I love you!
♫ Should I look and turn around? ♫

618
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,750
Aigoo, Sir!

619
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:23,140
Sir!

620
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:24,930
- Get yourself together!
- Over there...

621
00:43:24,930 --> 00:43:26,880
Sir Jo Yong Pil is there.

622
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,870
Have you gone crazy? What's wrong with you?

623
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:31,400
Pull yourself together!

624
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,960
- Aigoo, did he get possessed?
- Hey!

625
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:38,540
- What?
- Try closing your eyes!

626
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:40,480
♫ I linger by your side ♫

627
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,250
- Don't be shocked.
- Okay, okay.

628
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:44,860
Now, open your eyes!

629
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:48,140
- Wait, it's him...
- Aigoo...

630
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:49,590
It's Jo Yong Pil, isn't it?

631
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:52,850
- How is it?
- Your dad will stand tall with the foreman now.

632
00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:56,060
I knew he would like it more than the beef.

633
00:43:57,060 --> 00:44:02,140
By the way, how could a pair of glasses show Jo Yong Pil whenever you put them on?

634
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:04,650
They're called AR glasses.

635
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:07,100
Our company made them.

636
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:09,890
A-AR?

637
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:12,600
Yes.

638
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:16,770
Mom, do you remember doing a video call with me?

639
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:19,150
Wow... Oh, my!

640
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:20,780
Wh-What's this here?

641
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:26,290
Back then, I put a flower on my face and even a dog face too, right?

642
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,710
I laughed out loud back then.

643
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:32,600
Those glasses are the same.

644
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,940
Inside the real world that Dad is seeing,

645
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:38,300
there's a Jo Yong Pil in there, created with graphics.

646
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,890
I see...

647
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:42,160
So you're saying...

648
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:45,590
that Jo Yong Pil is fake, right?

649
00:44:45,590 --> 00:44:48,290
Wow, it's as good as the real one.

650
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:49,640
Sir...

651
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:52,480
- Aigoo, Sir!
- I'll go take this call, Mom.

652
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,590
Aigoo, Sir!

653
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:57,010
Aigoo!

654
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:02,530
I'm sorry. I took too long, right?

01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:34,600
Whether he's saying that because he knows something,

824
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:37,600
or he's trying to find out something...

825
01:01:38,750 --> 01:01:40,970
I just can't figure it out.

826
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,200
Hello?

827
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:56,100
This is Kwak Sam Su.

828
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:05,200
Yes, Director Kwak.

829
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:07,100
Let's meet.

830
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:09,000
I have something to give you.

831
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:14,000
- To me?
 - I'll tell you the truth

832
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
about that day.

833
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Please come out alone.

834
01:02:56,300 --> 01:02:58,200
Director Kwak, wake up.

835
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:00,000
Director Kwak!

836
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:07,600
Unless you stand next to me,

837
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:11,500
I can't guarantee your safety, either.

838
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:15,600
Director Kwak!

839
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:18,600
Director Kwak! Wake up!

840
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:26,400
H-Help me!

841
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:28,900
Hurry and call an ambulance!

842
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:32,100
Wake up! Director Kwak!

843
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:48,800
No. He called me and asked me to meet him.

844
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:50,500
He wouldn't kill himself like this.

845
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:52,400
Yes, yes...

846
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:55,000
I think so, too. Get him.

847
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,800
All right, everything you say from this point on

848
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:03,000
could be used against you in court.

849
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,200
So if you're scared,

850
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:10,000
it's better to stay silent.

851
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:14,900
What...

852
01:04:52,010 --> 01:04:56,350
♫ When I'm worried, I can trust in myself ♫

853
01:04:56,350 --> 01:05:00,160
♫ I'll just try to get my life back ♫

854
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:06,200
♫ Everything can freeze from my heart soon ♫

855
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:08,600
♫ Over you ♫

856
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:13,200
♫ Send me free right now ♫

857
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,900
[Unlock My Boss]

858
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:20,500
What should I do?

859
01:05:21,380 --> 01:05:24,380
Is there any other way? We toss him out.

860
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:27,400
Did you hear from In Seong?

861
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:28,200
No, I haven't heard.

862
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:30,000
More complex the situation is, make it simple.

863
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,600
I looked up the number that called me

864
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:35,400
and looks like it's near the Yeongpo Airport.

865
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:36,600
What are you doing right now?

866
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:37,900
Things will worsen if they know you're with me.

867
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:39,800
If he had left the base,

868
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:42,000
he should've just run without looking back.

869
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,100
If he was going to hesitate, he should've stayed in the base.

870
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:49,400
Okay, bring me the next base in here.
