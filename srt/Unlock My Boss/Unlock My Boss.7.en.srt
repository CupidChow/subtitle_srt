but he was found dead.

150

Did they try to put the blame on In Seong on purpose?

Mr. Kwak was found dead in his car.

159
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:13,330
Judging by the large number of coal briquettes found in the car,

160
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:15,120
the police have closed the case as a suicide.

161
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,940
There's no way it's a suicide.

162
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:19,790
Earlier, even the police said they thought it was murder.

163
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:24,590
This is why even the police can't be trusted.

164

Me? No,

171
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,840
it could be my family.

Okay, the runner on first base started running.

Why do you think that runner got out just now?

00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:59,510
That was another good defense.

I don't know.

183
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:12,570
It's because he hesitated to go onto the next base.

184
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:17,030
If he was going to hesitate, he should've stayed on the base.

185
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:20,240
If he left the base,

186
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,930
he should've just run without looking back.

187

What if he didn't hesitate?

190
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:46,790
If he had run without hesitation, would the result have been different?

191
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:51,690
You'll find out once you make the run.

You really don't have to go to work?

193

You still only think about yourself.

00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,950
When did I ever think only about myself?

204
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:35,560
Do you think I quit for my sake?

205
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,700
You don't even know anything.

When will President Park come back?

214
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:09,850
Director Kwak passed away like that,

215
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:11,680
so he took some time off to pull himself together.

216
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,620
Even so—

217
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:18,120
He must've told you when he'd be back.

218
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,640
I'll check with him again.

Gosh! Do we come to work because it's fun?

220
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:30,840
This is because we let just anybody become the president.

221
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:41,150
Haven't you heard from In Seong yet?

222
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,730
No, I haven't.

223
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,430
I think he went to his hometown.

224
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:51,350
Should I make a trip?

225
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:52,800
It's no use.

226
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,640
He turned down money and left.

227
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,840
Going there won't solve the problem.

228
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:03,350
He won't return unless he makes his own resolve.

229
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:06,990
But we can't just leave the president's position vacant forever.

President Kim said his soul was trapped inside.

And he told me to be president in his stead.

00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:31,850
Why?

334
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:35,410
Is it similar to that time?

335
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,040
That time?

336
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:44,360
Did you let your temper get the best of you again?

337
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,920
- I said that's enough!
- "I should write what I want to write"?

338
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:51,240
Fine. I must seem foolish in your eyes, not doing what I want to do in life.

339
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,070
But do you think you could say the same if you were from a poor family?

340
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:57,940
You have plenty of money and time. You can only say that because you are privileged enough to!

341
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,930
Then what about you?

342
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:02,770
How can you be so laidback when you have nothing at all?

343
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:06,320
Drama? Are you going to write a script?

344
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,160
You came all the way to Seoul to write a script, and all you do is pull all-nighters.

345
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:12,950
You stay up to watch movies, surf the internet, and sleep all day long!

346
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:17,490
And if you get knocked down, you drown yourself in alcohol.

347
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:21,050
Then you outrageously rebel against your father, who came all the way to Seoul

348
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:22,350
by asking around to take care of his immature daughter!

349
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,780
Keep your nose out of my family's affairs.

350
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:27,240
That male actor's acting is incredible.

351
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:34,510
Where did you go when we're so busy?

352
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:39,810
There's been a death in Kim's family. Of course, I should hurry and visit him.

353
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:42,090
- Which Kim?
- What?

354
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:46,870
You know...

355
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:56,730
Why are you being so nosy in a man's business?

356
00:27:56,730 --> 00:28:01,470
Traditionally, they say men are the sky, and women are just land. The land.

357
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:05,110
You do know that land is more expensive these days, right?

358
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:08,810
If you don't want to face another death, come home immediately!

359
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:17,010
That's not what's important!

360
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,350
Just say you didn't see anything.

361
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:24,000
I saw it!

362
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,670
CEO Han touched Ji Yeon during the afterparty for "Blazing Fireworks."

363
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:33,960
All right, but if you just turn a blind eye, it'll pass without any problems.

364
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,600
We need to continue acting!

365
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:39,510
How could you say something like that, Sunbae?

366
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:42,260
In Seong, calm down first. Okay?

367
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:47,200
Geez! Then what? What should I do? Well? What can I do?

368
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,020
If you hit a rock with an egg, it's the egg that will smash.

369
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:55,720
He acts like that, knowing the eggs care too much about their own well-being!

370
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,850
You're turning me into the crazy one!

371
00:28:57,850 --> 00:28:59,830
Sunbaenim, calm down.

372
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:01,380
I won't hit him.

373
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,690
Hey, CEO Han,

374
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:09,580
he has connections in movies, production, and everywhere else.

375
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,770
I'm saying all this for your sake!

376
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:14,400
We know, we know. In Seong is well aware, too.

377
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,860
Hey, if you're targeted by that asshole, you'll have to leave this field.

378
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:21,330
Is that all right with you?

379
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:24,410
Wow, hey!

380
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:29,220
If I get kicked out for pointing out something is wrong, I'd rather not do it.

381
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,620
Hey–

382
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:32,930
- That little...
- Hey, In Seong!

383
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:36,450
Sunbaenim, Sunbaenim! Hold on.

384
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:40,620
I don't think this is right, either.

385
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:49,910
You did fine as an actor. Why did you suddenly quit?

386
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:54,130
It just doesn't suit me.

387
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:57,450
But you said I'd be able to see you star in a morning drama.

388
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:04,380
Something happened, right?

389
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,730
Nothing happened.

390
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:10,840

"To die—to sleep,"

Why not?

He's the guy. CEO Han!

403

Huh? Han?

404
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,010
So don't pay him any attention.

Next person, come in!

My talent was shot down to the very end.

407

Gosh, if you quit now, what will you do from now on?

408
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:14,820
I'll have to take my time and look for something.

409
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:18,830
I'm at an age where I can even chew rocks.

Were you aware of everything?

411
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:31,300
If you want to live a good life,

412
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:36,040
you have to turn a blind eye and turn a deaf ear sometimes.

413
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:42,020
If you act all noble on your high horse, it's only your loss in the end.

414

Even though I had lived without much to my name, I was proud

to have raised a son like you.

420
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:29,260
I'm sorry for being a lousy dad.

421

I couldn't even help my only child

Of course, he'd want to run away. After all, he got locked up in a cell.

434

Do you think everyone is like you?

435
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:51,040
Is he not here again? Why doesn't Uncle In Seong come around these days?

436
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,500
He's busy because of work, so...

437
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:58,520
Lies! He's the same as Dad. Uncle In Seong also left!

- She's right.

so I won't have to.

656
00:54:46,610 --> 00:54:48,890
Yes, Director Kwak.

657
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:07,220
I think we'll need to buy a new flower pot.

658
00:55:09,710 --> 00:55:11,560
Yes.

659
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:13,450
I'll proceed.

660
00:55:28,830 --> 00:55:30,610
We've arrived.

661
00:55:36,990 --> 00:55:40,740
Is President Park doing a good job?

662
00:55:41,570 --> 00:55:44,610
He hasn't come in touch with Executive Director Oh yet.

663
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:50,020
Keep an eye on him.

664
00:55:56,270 --> 00:56:00,120
From what I saw at the press conference, President Park

665
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:03,600
was obsessing over his wireless earphones.

666
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:04,950
Just as if

667
00:56:04,950 --> 00:56:08,900
he was reading a script that someone fed him.

668
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:11,020
I'll also look into that.

669
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:23,800
If it's Mr. No, it has to be Vice Chairman Oh, right?

670
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:29,010
I know he has a personal vendetta against President Kim, but this isn't right.

671
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:31,490
It's not just personal vendetta.

672
00:56:31,490 --> 00:56:37,510
Once self-driving cars launch, he has no other option than to hand over Beomyeong completely to his niece.

673
00:56:37,510 --> 00:56:39,710
Still, this is way too much.

674
00:56:39,710 --> 00:56:42,730
Didn't he work with Director Kwak for over twenty years?

675
00:56:42,730 --> 00:56:44,630
Could he hurt someone who's almost like a family member?

676
00:56:44,630 --> 00:56:47,280
We need to make him pay for his crimes.

677
00:57:05,230 --> 00:57:06,760
Oh, hello.

678
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:09,540
Your house is so nice!

679
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:17,150
[B-Mart]

680
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:28,720
Be careful.

681
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:32,310
He was in the special forces and became Oh Yeong Geun's personal driver last year.

682
00:57:32,310 --> 00:57:33,510
Is he from the special forces?

683
00:57:33,510 --> 00:57:37,770
Vice Chairman Oh always prefers people with military backgrounds.

684
00:58:23,990 --> 00:58:26,590
Fancy seeing you at a place like this.

685
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:29,290
Because I followed you.

686
00:58:29,290 --> 00:58:31,170
"You followed me"?

687
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:35,310
Do you have a word for me to pass on to the Vice Chairman?

688
00:58:36,010 --> 00:58:39,900
Let's not... waste our time.

689
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:59,340
You secretly followed Director Kwak, and

690
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:04,000
he was subject to "suicide" the next day, coincidentally.

691
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,300
I'm going to the police station with this in my hand,

692
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:12,630
which means this is the last chance for you to decide.

693
00:59:12,630 --> 00:59:15,010
If you go the police,

694
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:17,960
will they willingly listen to what you have to say?

695
00:59:19,290 --> 00:59:21,740
Don't be mistaken.

696
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:24,080
You're up against Beomyeong.

697
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:35,090

You should've expected this much.

717
01:00:56,950 --> 01:01:00,650
He's holding a gun. What do I do now?

718
01:01:00,650 --> 01:01:03,240
From what I saw at the press conference, President Park is

719
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:06,450
obsessed over his wireless earphones.

720
01:01:10,580 --> 01:01:13,180
Worried about your phone even in this urgent situation?

721
01:01:13,180 --> 01:01:15,090
It must be an extremely important thing.

722
01:01:15,090 --> 01:01:19,150
I was curious about who was behind the job seeker from a small-time village.

723
01:01:19,150 --> 01:01:21,370
It looks like I'll find out soon.

01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:28,130
Don't try anything funny and pretend not to know anything

725

if you want to save your life at least.

726
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:49,880
How could you get the phone taken from you?

727
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:52,460
This means President Kim has been kidnapped.

728
01:01:53,890 --> 01:01:55,270
No.

729
01:01:56,690 --> 01:01:58,450
It's all part of a plan.

730
01:02:07,690 --> 01:02:09,920
Let's go to a nearby motel.

731
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:51,180
Yes.

732
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:55,260
I'll relocate for now.

733
01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:58,600

from this moment on,

- Am I also included?
- Yes.

743
01:04:07,870 --> 01:04:09,070
President Park's phone, it is...

744
01:04:09,070 --> 01:04:10,030
You can unlock this, right?

745
01:04:10,030 --> 01:04:12,360
I'm going to check who's above him.

Please go to BY Hotel.

There's no time.
