who has been serving the duties of the Chairman after Chairman Oh Beom Geun collapsed last year,

163
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:13,470
and Vice Chairman Oh Young Geun, who has been a part of the Beomyeong legacy, is expected to begin.

164
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:16,010
Chairman Yang Jun Cheol of Ore Premise came to offer his condolences.

165
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:19,800
Also, I'm investigating an employee of Silver Lining.

166
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,590
The situation isn't looking good.

167
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:23,470
Hey, I'm the victim.

168
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:25,230
Why are you locking me up here?

169
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,500
Call your chief.

170
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,230
Tell him to come out. Come out, shit!

171
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,570
Where is your chief?

172
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:34,240
Adding one more star.

173
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:53,800
Thank you for coming.

174
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:57,030
There are too many people in there

175
00:11:57,030 --> 00:12:00,040
who only see what they want to see

176
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,650
and say what they want to say.

177
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,100
Yes.

178
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,450
Have you heard from President Kim?

179
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:15,890
Baro 4.0.

180
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,440
It's still in beta testing.

181
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,360
That's not something Silver Lining's president should say.

182
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:36,100
Are you keeping back stuff even from me?

183
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,380
Or...

184
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:42,060
did President Kim Seon Ju not tell you anything?

185
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:45,130
- I'll confirm it and—
- I guess...

186
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:48,240
I'm being too naïve to think

187
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,390
we would be looking in the same direction just because

188
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:54,040
we're wearing the same uniforms, right?

189
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:01,180
Move.

190
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:04,990
What are you scheming here?

191
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,370
It hasn't been long since my brother passed away.

192
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:12,860
You're mistaken. We were just—

193
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:17,030
President Kim Seon Ju is sorry for not being able to come in person.

194
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:19,360
Yes.

195
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:22,190
He asked me to deliver his condolences.

196
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:26,700
Even so, the most important elder of the group passed away.

197
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:31,420
This is why those who lack roots are just...

198
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:47,970
I said, explain it to me!

199
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,770
What is so special about Baro 4.0 that

200
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:55,930
director Oh would call me out separately?

201
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,730
It's better for you to not know, In Seong.

202
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,600
These past few days,

203
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:20,840
the media was very noisy.

204
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:25,000
If only my brother didn't pass in vain without deciding on the heir...

205
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,310
Are you upset that he passed away in vain, or

206
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:31,530
are you upset that he didn't decide on the heir?

207
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:34,390
It's such a pity.

208
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:36,850
If only Seung Won was alive,

209
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:38,990
there wouldn't be worries about an heir.

210
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:41,920
Why are you bringing up Seung Won again...

211
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,110
whom I-I...

212
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:47,610
I buried in my heart?

213
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:53,880
Are you uncomfortable talking about your dead brother, or

214
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:57,170
are you anxious because you have some truth

215
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:59,410
that you want to hide?

216
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:02,090
The truth, you say?

217
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:05,420
Your brother

218
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,530
and my brother,

219
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:13,350
those who were to lead Beomyeong, all died one by one.

220
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:16,280
If we were to go by your words,

221
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,710
then am I next,

222
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,240
Uncle?

223
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,530
I thought about your advice over and over.

224
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:26,630
What it is that I have to do.

225
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,330
They'll have a board meeting at the end of the year

226
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:34,420
to vote for the next Chairman.

227
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,860
You're going to settle the fight before

228
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,440
self-driving cars get launched?

229
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:43,250
Will that even be possible?

230
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,980
When I, the largest shareholder of Beomyeong,

231
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,500
am still alive?

232
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:53,210
That was the case when my brother was alive.

233
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:58,290
I've already finished talking with the board members.

234
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,360
Yes, Son.

235
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,630
Did you have dinner?

236
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:18,170
Oh, we're about to eat now.

237
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:19,800
What about you?

238
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,900
I also ate.

239
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,440
Why? Is something wrong?

240
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,540
It's nothing.

241
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,860
I was just

242
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,130
wondering if you guys are doing well.

243
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:34,950
You were here just a few days ago.

244
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:39,410
What's wrong? Tell me about it.

245
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,990
There's nothing wrong.

246
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,390
What?

247
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:55,070
Did you think I wouldn't know if something was wrong by hearing your voice? I raised you for thirty years.

248
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,820
Why?

249
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,470
Is it work?

250
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:02,100
You know.

251
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:06,140
There are just times when

252
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:10,110
you've been walking for some time along a path

253
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:11,740
and then suddenly

254
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:15,280
question if that's the right way.

255
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,200
The world is a series of forked roads at any given point.

256
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,650
Whichever way you go,

257
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:25,150
you'll always be curious about the other one.

258
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:29,100
It's a double bind. You will regret it either way.

259
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:32,190
However, Son,

260
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:35,140
if you're going to regret it anyway,

261
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:38,850
wouldn't it be better just to go the way you want?

262
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,890
Okay, let's hang up now.

263
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,200
This man, seriously!

264
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,100
How could you do this?

265
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,650
What's the matter?

266
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:17,930
You said it just now, Honey.

267
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:22,330
"If you're going to regret it anyway, just have it your way."

268
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:23,720
My god!

269
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:27,980
We have lived together for thirty years. Don't you know if I want the sauce all over or on the side?

270
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:30,480
Right, Baro?

271
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,080
Why is he crying now?

272
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,090
Seriously!

273
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:40,460
Take this!

274
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:45,370
It's still delicious this way, Honey.

275
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,740
Gosh, I don't want it!

276
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:03,290
You're acting as you like, again.

277
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:05,120
In Seong,

278
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,510
if you're not willing, just quit.

279
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:09,380
There are more than enough people who'd take a billion won.

280
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:13,270
President Kim.

281
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:19,530
You said the more I know,

282
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:22,140
the more you can't trust me, right?

283
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,190
I'm the opposite of that.

284
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:27,640
The more you hide from me,

285
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,050
the less I can trust you, President Kim.

286
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:33,200
And I want to trust you.

287
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:45,190
He was released just now.

288
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:46,800
Okay.

289
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:50,820
He said they released him just now.

290
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:10,730
I'm going down the subway.

291
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:12,260
Okay.

292
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,370
Yes.

293
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:17,530
It's okay because I'm a big shareholder.

294
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:18,870
Yes.

295
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:20,730
I need to protect it no matter what

296
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:22,900
because I'm a big shareholder.

297
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,740
Hey, wait, wait a minute. He's getting on.

298
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:29,120
The train is arriving at the station. Please be careful.

299
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,760
The train is stopping at Hankuk University Entrance Station.

300
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:37,530
Please wait for the doors to open completely.

301
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:42,020
[Hankuk University Entrance]

302
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,570
The doors are opening.

303
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:47,500
This is Hankuk University Entrance Station.

304
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:54,860
Excuse me.

305
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:57,220
Yes, I'm here.

306
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,760
Yes.

307
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:02,440
What?

308
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,170
I'll follow him in the car. Just tell me the station.

309
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:08,790
Wait a second!

310
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:15,150
- What's wrong? I have to--
- Hyun Ho got on the s-subway?

311
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,440
T-That can't be...

312
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,380
What are you talking about?

313
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,000
Right now, Nam Sang Won's...

314
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,810
- Nam Sang Won's phone signal is detected inside the station!
- What?

315
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:50,980
Shit!

316
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,750
Hey!

317
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,450
Nam Sang Won!

318
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,850
I'm on my way up right now.

319
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:33,850
Yes, I'll go up and wait.

320
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,460
- Hey, you!
- Let go!

321
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,780
Let me go!

322
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:41,740
What's going on?

323
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,050
Did you find him?

324
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:05,020
I lost him.

325
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:07,820
Isn't it a big problem if you lose him?

326
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:10,530
I'll explain it to you later. Sorry.

327
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,720
What do we do now?

328
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,510
Isn't it the choice you made, In Seong?

329
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:26,510
You know it couldn't be helped.

330
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:30,040
You also know we're not in a situation to meddle in other's business!

331
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:34,400
You're really hard to work with, In Seong.

332
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,130
Yes, I've always been like this.

333
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:41,070
Thanks to that meddling, I'm helping you right now, President.

334
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:45,820
If I had the chance to redo this situation or when I had picked up the phone, I would still do the same thing.

335
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:48,510
So you make the choice, President Kim,

336
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:51,430
if you want to keep working with someone like this.

337
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,810
We need Baro 4.0

338
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:58,850
to complete the self-driving cars.

339
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:03,740
I've never regretted my decision.

340
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:07,080
I hope you won't become my first regret.

341
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:49,620
Nam Sang Won.

342
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,480
Room 202.

343
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,900
Why are there so many?

344
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:07,800
Wow.

345
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,640
Were you startled? I'm sorry.

346
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,750
Gosh, you scared me.

347
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:17,170
Do you want to hire a bodyguard?

348
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:20,760
Not just someone who's simply good at fighting,

349
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,920
but someone who knows how to tail people,

350
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,410
uses whatever means necessary,

351
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:26,530
and is on our side.

352
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:30,190
How can we find someone like that right away?

353
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:32,530
I'll try posting an announcement.

354
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,990
Go your way.

355
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:49,470
Hey, how could you run off on your own?

356
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:52,690
Who do you think I was locked up for?

357
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,860
Have you lost your mind?

358
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,820
Do you even know what kind of person he is?

359
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:18,310
Yes.

360
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,710
He can protect us against an attack by many

361
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:27,080
and also do illegal things like location tracking without a second thought.

362
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,980
He's just a crazy guy. Crazy!

363
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,210
He's a dog! A dog! You don't know who he'll bite!

364
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:34,930
There's still one thing that's certain.

365
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:40,790
Seeing how he had a bloody fight with Mr. Nam, he's not on their side, at least.

366
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:44,450
We have to prioritize this condition before anything.

367
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:45,520
President Kim.

368
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:50,100
However... will he accept this offer?

369
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,650
You don't need to worry about that.

370
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,250
[Bodyguard Contract]

371
00:27:58,130 --> 00:27:59,850
Why would I?

372
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,000
The previous president is

373
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:09,500
missing, so we're looking for him.

374
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:11,800
We're also prepared for situations like

375
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,050
abduction or something worse.

376
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:16,840
What does that have to do with me?

377
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,460
- As you saw that day...
- What?

378
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:23,110
You don't know when you'll be taken down?

379
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:30,280
No.

380
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:33,490
As you saw that day...

381
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:36,000
I have a lot of money.

382
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:41,120
You said you trust money, not people, right?

383
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,640
Do what you usually do then.

384
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,020
One check* is too little.
(One usually means 100 million won)

385
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,530
Four checks.

386
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:15,730
Four checks?

387
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:18,350
How can you raise it four times?

388
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:19,980
Two checks. It's double the amount.

389
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,560
Four checks.

390
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:25,880
- Three checks!
- Four checks.

391
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,930
Excuse me, Sir.

392
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:30,800
It's already three-fold. This is nonsense.

393
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,050
Four checks!

394
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:37,630
I understand.

395
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:40,210
But there's a condition.

396
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:42,640
We can't give you an advance payment.

397
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,020
I will pay you weekly instead.

398
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,740
Okay.

399
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:56,300
Four checks.

400
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,570
Are you there?

401
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:12,380
I don't think he's there. Let's come back tomorrow.

402
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:13,900
No, that's not it.

403
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:16,800
I think I hear the television inside.

404
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:36,270
Where are you going during work hours?

405
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:55,200
Wow... you can't climb up there.

406
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:06,210
Oh, hello. It's nothing.

407
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:08,940
Yes, it's okay. Yes.

408
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:18,570
Wow.

409
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:22,250
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, yes.

410
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:29,250
Hey, Glasses.

411
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:31,400
I see you.

412
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,420
- Open the door!
- Who's that punk?

413
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:35,200
Hey!

414
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,970
Hey, Glasses!

415
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:39,400
- Open the door!
- Wow.

416
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,190
- Shouldn't you call the police?
- Hey.

417
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:44,010
Glasses!

418
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,230
Who are you?

419
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:53,010
You must've been shocked. I'm sorry.

420
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:55,150
Did Kim Eun Hee send you here?

421
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:58,360
It says our employee lives here.

422
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,310
Nope. This is my house.

423
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,860
I've been living here for ten years.

424
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:04,320
What's this? This isn't your house, Oppa?

425
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,800
No, it's my house. Mine.

426
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,920
By the way, who's Kim Eun Hee?

427
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,940
Kim Eun Hee?

428
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:13,310
Oh, she was the class president from fourth grade.

429
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:15,070
May I know your name?

430
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,840
Who? Me?

431
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,030
I'm Park Hang Jun.

432
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:20,420
What? It's not Nam.

433
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:24,040
Oppa! Who's Park Hang Jun? Your name's Jang Hang Jun.

434
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,210
Oh, well...

435
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:28,360
I changed my name in seventh grade.

436
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:31,600
- Actually, since I was nine...
- I'm sorry.

437
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,380
I heard this place was the sanctuary of burner phones.

438
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,150
How much are you looking to spend?

439
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:49,210
We're not the ones who need one. We're looking for a number.

440
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,310
Hey.

441
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,210
Get lost.

442
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:02,550
Get lost! Shit!

443
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:06,980
Oh, Hyung-nim.

444
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:10,350
You didn't even give me a call and came so suddenly.

445
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:12,280
What brings you here today, Hyung-nim?

446
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:17,230
I'd have everything prepared if you had let me know in advance.

447
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,140
Should I

448
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:23,360
bring you some pickled radish or something?

449
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,420
- Bring kimchi.
- Kimchi.

450
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:47,910
I looked everywhere, but I don't think it's a number that we provided.

451
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:50,200
- Are you sure?
- Gosh, Hyung-nim.

452
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,430
Don't you know who I am? I'm pretty sure.

453
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:56,580
Please tell me if Nam Sang Won is one of the graduates from the class of 2012.

454
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:59,670
I can't tell you private information.

455
00:34:10,930 --> 00:34:14,110
Ready, action.

456
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:17,590
Excuse me.

457
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:22,430
She has three months left.

458
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,900
My wife

459
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:30,470
wants to say bye to her first love.

460
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:34,240
A young person like her. How sad.

Please, at least an emergency contact or even

462
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:43,940
the department representative's number from that year.

463
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:46,700
I can't do it without the person's permission.

464
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:03,750
How should I put it?

465
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:06,000
Please help me out just once.

466
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:09,390
I told you I couldn't.

467
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:13,090
I'm gravely ill.

468
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:22,300
I do have good eyes for people.

[Student Union]

470
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:30,870
Oh, yes. I understand.

471
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,790
There was no one named Nam Sang Won in the batch.

472
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:40,650
Address, contact,

473
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:43,630
education... they're all fake.

474
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:45,970
How on earth is this possible?

475
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:52,050
Where the heck could Nam Sang Won be right now?

476
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:21,460
Yes, I just arrived.

477
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:24,070
What did his co-workers say?

478
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:27,520
He was not close to anyone, nor did he keep in touch with anyone.

479
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,560
His tasks usually involved working outside of the office.

480
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:32,400
They said he was a loner.

481
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:36,070
How did that ghost-like person get hired

482
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:38,660
and even become the team leader at Silver Lining

483
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:42,360
when I was rejected like that?

484
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,120
Someone who needed Nam Sang Won

485
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,390
must've given him a high score.

486
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:47,580
Who is that person?

487
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,040
I'll need to check.

488
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,940
I'll look for the records in the company servers.

489
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:58,170
President, your guests arrived.

490
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:01,710
Guests?

491
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:03,680
I'm saying his voice didn't sound good.

00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,820
I am telling you, something is wrong.

493
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:08,720
What are you doing? Hurry it up.

494
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,810
But why did the receptionist

495
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:13,390
tell us to go up to the CEO's Office?

496
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,630
Maybe our In Seong...

497
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:22,260
What about In Seong?

498
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:25,020
Did he do something wrong and get called in?

499
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:27,360
Is that why his voice sounded weird?

500
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,790
Gosh, In Seong!

501
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:30,690
He was called in!

502
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:32,800
Wait for me!

503
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,160
- Hurry and come! Hurry!
- Gosh!

504
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:42,120
What do I do?

505
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,130
Why?

506
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:45,200
My parents don't know I'm the president.

507
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,910
You can just tell them now.

508
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:49,460
So...

509
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:52,960
I picked up a phone one fine day while hiking the backwoods,

510
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,150
but the president who was trapped in there

511
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:58,980
made me the successor of a conglomerate just like that? Do I say that?

512
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,780
It's because you don't know my parents well, Se Yeon.

513
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:07,110
My father would admit me to a hospital, saying I'm crazy,

514
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:09,010
and my mother would

515
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,050
perform an exorcism here.

516
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:12,580
Yes, she'd do just that.

517
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:14,970
What do you want to do then?

518
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:19,600
I need to hide first.

519
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:23,530
This way.

- M-Mom...
- In Seong!

522
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:33,130
In Seong.

523
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:34,890
Dad.

524
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:40,870
She's your supervisor from last time, right?

525
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,360
Hello.

526
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,590
Anyhow, you punk.

527
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:47,980
Why were you called into the President's Office?

528
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:49,930
Yes, why?

529
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:52,810
So, the thing is...

530
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:54,500
that I'm...

531
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:57,330
- Mom, Dad, listen carefully.
- Yes.

532
00:38:57,330 --> 00:38:59,590
Don't be shocked.

533
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:01,160
The thing is...

534
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:04,480
Hurry and spill it, Punk!

535
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,410
- Are you hiding something?
- Secretary Park!

536
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:10,410
You did a good job.

537
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:23,050
- Please deliver these documents without mistake.
- Wait, that means...

538
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:25,380
His immediate supervisor is...

539
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:33,670
I didn't recognize you.

540
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:37,150
A young character like you–

541
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:38,400
I mean...

542
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,120
a young individual like you, you must be very competent.

543
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,290
He's a good boy.

544
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,710
Wait, does that mean you're

545
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:50,360
working in the President's Office?

546
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,400
Where is the President's Office?

547
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:55,720
Wow, I'm stepping up in life, thanks to my son.

548
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,550
Getting to look around the President's Office and all.

What are you doing?

551
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:04,890
Why are you standing there like that?

552
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:07,640
Oh, my. I almost forgot.

553
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,810
Would you like a cup of tea?

554
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:15,030
Why would the president make tea?

555
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:17,890
You should be doing it. Have you gone mad?

556
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:19,480
This boy is out of his mind.

557
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:22,230
President Jeong, I'll go make tea.

558
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:24,350
- Gosh, that clumsy guy.
- My goodness.

559
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:26,970
Shall we do that, Secretary Park?

560
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:29,440
He lacks a bit of common sense.

561
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,770
He's nice, though.

562
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:34,470
The President's Office is so grand, right?

563
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:41,290
You must be busy. I hope we are not wasting your time.

564
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:44,900
I was just going to drop off the apples and go.

565
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,800
I'm sure apples are common in Seoul, but

566
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:51,570
our apples don't have any pesticides,

567
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:54,520
and they have been grown with a lot of care,

568
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,890
just how I raised In Seong—

- President!
- Yes.

00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:04,950
Oh, you have guests.

571

Hello, I am director Kwak Sam Su.

572
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,910
Gosh, the director?

573
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:12,860
- I am in your care.
- Oh my.

574
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:16,570
- What are you doing here, Secretary Jeong?
- Oh, that's right, director.

575
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:19,170
- Yes.
- Come this way, please.

576
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:22,580
- Why is the poster slanted like that?
- Never mind that. It's okay.

577
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,250
You were surprised, right?

578
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:29,070
Our employees are very close, like family.

579
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:31,770
Why is Secretary Jeong not at her place and--

580
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:36,960
Okay, but what's this?

581
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:42,400
Take this home and share it with your family.

582
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,430

(A term describing fathers who live alone to support their families to live and study overseas)

583
00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:48,390
Oh, then... please pass it on to the Vice Chairman.

584
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:49,650
Right now?

585
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:52,480
- Then I'll have it delivered–
- Delivered?

586
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,220
I want you to go personally.

587
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:57,230
Go on.

588
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:01,670
You guys don't visit often. You should have a meal, at least.

It's okay.

590
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:06,120

Then I'll escort you to the terminal.

593
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,660
A newbie shouldn't leave their desk like this.

594
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,410
People will talk.

595
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:15,400
He's right.

596
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,090
All right, then.

597
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:18,680
I'll at least fetch you guys a cab then.

598
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:19,990
No.

599

600
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:23,650
- Oh, the bus is here. Take care.
- Honey.

601
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:28,150
I-In Seong!

602
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:40,880
Gosh.

603
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,540
What can we do?

604
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:47,160
I think In Seong seems to like her.

605
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:50,390
I hope he doesn't get hurt.

606
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:56,750
But seeing how she accompanied him to our place,

607
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:59,430
the possibility of it isn't zero...

608
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,780
What's wrong?

609
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:07,050
No, it's nothing.

611
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:15,050
In Seong's desk earlier?

612
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:16,790
Wait a minute.

00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:19,790
Where is the restroom?

614
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,450
His desk is indeed a bit small.

615
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:06,690
Even so, we have to understand.

616
00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:09,770
A secretary has to be on standby all the time.

617
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:12,820
That's not what I mean.

618
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,500
There was an AC on top.

619
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:19,740
I think there was a heater too.

620
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:24,880
We couldn't avoid the scorching sun,

621
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:30,620
whether it was raining or snowing, you know?

622
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:36,110
He'll at least have a proper life, it seems.

623
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,630
That's one less worry for me.

your parents might see it in the news.

628

We'll need a more thorough solution.

629
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:19,590

Yes.

A box of apples?

638
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:14,000
Could he possibly have sent just a mere box of apples

639
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,500
to the renowned Beomyeong Group's Vice Chairman?

640
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,440

"technology with character*" and all.
(Pronounced "inseong" in Korean)

But this is too old-fashioned.

in a box of apples?

648
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:13,600
N-No... No, Vice Chairman... It's not me...

649
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,300
I brought it over as it is.

823
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:07,230

01:01:09,350 --> 01:01:11,700
So like a dream,

826
01:01:12,530 --> 01:01:16,200
I ended up standing in front of the camera.

827
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:17,810
It looks like he's reallg crying!

828
01:01:17,810 --> 01:01:19,870
- Oh, my goodness, what do I do?
- Come on, be quiet.

829
01:01:19,870 --> 01:01:20,940
You need to be quiet.

830
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:23,850
Mom! Please save me!

831
01:01:23,850 --> 01:01:25,840
Mom!

832
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:27,820
I'm scared!

833
01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:31,520
Cut, cut, cut!

- My gosh, In Seong!
- Stay here!

835
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:35,980
If you keep calling Mom, it's NG, okay?

836
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:37,230
Okay, okay.

837

His emotions are good.

01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:44,230
Okay. It's an okay.

839
01:01:44,230 --> 01:01:50,300
After hearing, "Ready, Action,"

840
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:54,900
for the first time that day, my heart was trembling so much.

841
01:01:56,020 --> 01:02:00,990
Then the picture frame they had at home was...

842
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:10,710
The movie was released, but there were no theaters in the neighborhood.

843
01:02:11,970 --> 01:02:19,230
Dad drove us two hours to watch me appear for two seconds before we came back.

844
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:25,460
Even so... your parents must've been overjoyed.

01:02:25,460 --> 01:02:28,310
There was even a banner.

I haven't heard that word in a long time.

851
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:52,180
A dream at twenty-nine?

852
01:02:52,180 --> 01:02:54,770
What's wrong with being twenty-nine?

853
01:02:54,770 --> 01:02:58,440
You can be anything except a child actor.

854
01:02:59,420 --> 01:03:01,950
Oh, you laughed.

855
01:03:01,950 --> 01:03:03,160
I didn't laugh.

856
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:04,370
Do you know how to laugh, too?

857
01:03:04,370 --> 01:03:07,170
- You laughed just now.
- I didn't laugh.

858
01:03:07,170 --> 01:03:09,670
Well, you did laugh.

859
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:13,730
- You did laugh, though?
- I said, I didn't laugh.

860
01:03:13,730 --> 01:03:15,460
You laughed just now. You were laughing hard.

861
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:16,700
I didn't laugh.

862
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:18,950
- Where are you going, by the way?
- The restroom.

Let's drink just one more can after you come back.

864
01:03:20,780 --> 01:03:22,740
You're drunk. Stop drinking.

865
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:25,280
I'm way too sober, though.

866
01:03:26,950 --> 01:03:30,330
I wanted to drink one more can.

867
01:03:31,150 --> 01:03:34,360
Gosh, who am I going to drink with?

868
01:03:54,030 --> 01:03:57,740
Where did Unni go?

869
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:09,280
There,

870
01:04:11,470 --> 01:04:13,410

Let's have a drink today.

- Cheers.

- We're out camping.

Think of it romantically. With romance.

879
01:04:40,650 --> 01:04:44,620
This is anything but romantic. It is seriously pathetic.

880
01:04:44,620 --> 01:04:49,100
And also... how is this drinking together?

881
01:04:49,100 --> 01:04:50,900
It's a ritual table.

882

Gosh, so hard to please.

and call Hyung "Hyung."

Please quit it.

Sometimes, I'm flustered by this reckless side of you, In Seong.

Gosh, I'm sorry.

Willingly butting into something completely irrelevant to you,

Of course. It's because I'm human.

919
01:07:05,250 --> 01:07:08,120
I got to eat that.

920

01:07:16,590 --> 01:07:19,460
It's a night that makes me want a glass of wine.

922
01:07:19,460 --> 01:07:25,730
Min Ah would've also had more memories if her mom were alive.

Don't become weak now. That's not like you.

We'll get the culprit quickly and

you can just create more memories for Min Ah.

926

Even if we do catch the culprit, would I be able to go back to Min Ah?
