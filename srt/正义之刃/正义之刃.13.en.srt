(I saw what's in the USB. I know why Soo Jeong and your brother died.)

12
00:03:50,008 --> 00:03:51,508
I saw what's in the USB.

13
00:03:51,767 --> 00:03:53,308
I know why...

14
00:03:54,177 --> 00:03:55,978
Soo Jeong and your brother died.

19
00:05:27,567 --> 00:05:29,698
Yes, it's the same Jang Young Mi from the trial.

20
00:05:30,067 --> 00:05:33,437
Mr. Nam, could you track her phone's last whereabouts?

21
00:06:02,067 --> 00:06:05,138
I saw what's in the USB. I know why...

22
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:07,877
Soo Jeong and your brother died.

(Audition Video)

25
00:06:25,088 --> 00:06:26,388
Hello, sir.

26
00:06:28,557 --> 00:06:32,698
My granddaughter is okay, right?

27
00:06:34,698 --> 00:06:35,768
Did you say that she left home...

28
00:06:35,768 --> 00:06:37,208
after getting a call from her president?

29
00:06:37,638 --> 00:06:38,638
Yes.

30
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:41,638
He said he was waiting outside.

31
00:06:43,247 --> 00:06:44,807
Do you have his number?

32
00:06:45,948 --> 00:06:47,917
The number you have called is currently turned off.

33
00:06:54,757 --> 00:06:55,857
Yes, Mr. Nam.

34
00:06:57,088 --> 00:06:58,658
Where was the last location of her phone?

35
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:00,658
Where was it?

36
00:07:15,538 --> 00:07:16,578
Lawyer Lee.

37
00:07:18,578 --> 00:07:21,117
What is going on in the middle of the night?

38
00:07:21,718 --> 00:07:22,848
- Mr. Nam. - Yes?

39
00:07:22,848 --> 00:07:25,088
Please verify all the vehicles that have passed here...

40
00:07:25,088 --> 00:07:27,288
two hours before and after her disappearance.

41
00:07:28,187 --> 00:07:29,218
Yes, sir.

42
00:07:29,987 --> 00:07:33,598
By the way, what happened to her?

43
00:07:34,497 --> 00:07:35,528
I'm not sure yet.

44
00:07:35,828 --> 00:07:38,828
And please check tomorrow whether or not she came home.

45
00:07:39,297 --> 00:07:40,297
Yes, sir.

46
00:07:50,778 --> 00:07:53,718
(Statement)

47
00:07:54,278 --> 00:07:55,648
You're quite brazen.

48
00:07:56,817 --> 00:07:58,888
How could you try to run over an incumbent prosecutor?

49
00:08:02,687 --> 00:08:04,528
I was just doing as I was told.

50
00:08:04,927 --> 00:08:06,088
Was it Jang Chi Soo?

51
00:08:07,828 --> 00:08:08,898
Did he tell you to kill me?

52
00:08:17,437 --> 00:08:18,567
Write it down.

53
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:34,318
That lunatic was about to request for a warrant.

54
00:08:36,928 --> 00:08:38,657
I'm dying here.

55
00:08:39,188 --> 00:08:41,757
Chairman Song can't treat me like this.

56
00:08:41,757 --> 00:08:44,328
I did all this for him. He can't just feign ignorance...

57
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:53,237
What I'm trying to say is...

58
00:09:09,418 --> 00:09:10,458
How may I help you?

59
00:09:14,558 --> 00:09:15,798
Where's Jang Young Mi?

60
00:09:17,168 --> 00:09:18,198
Sorry?

61
00:09:21,798 --> 00:09:24,867
You met her yesterday. So where is she?

62
00:09:28,938 --> 00:09:30,107
She's probably home.

63
00:09:31,578 --> 00:09:34,718
After going out to meet with you, she never came home.

64
00:09:53,668 --> 00:09:54,798
Did you kill her?

65
00:10:00,478 --> 00:10:03,007
What are you doing after barging into my office?

66
00:10:04,607 --> 00:10:05,678
I'll report you.

67
00:10:05,948 --> 00:10:08,277
I couldn't care less if you did.

68
00:10:08,478 --> 00:10:09,848
Did you kill her?

69
00:10:11,818 --> 00:10:13,718
I heard one of your actresses were killed recently.

70
00:10:14,357 --> 00:10:16,017
Did you kill Young Mi the same way as well?

71
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:20,357
Darn it.

72
00:10:21,058 --> 00:10:22,728
This is just my luck.

73
00:10:28,198 --> 00:10:31,168
Whoever did it, bring her back this instant...

74
00:10:31,407 --> 00:10:32,838
if you don't want any trouble.

75
00:10:34,377 --> 00:10:35,808
Right, what about Chairman Song?

76
00:10:37,478 --> 00:10:38,978
Where's Chairman Song?

77
00:10:43,647 --> 00:10:44,848
At his home, sir.

78
00:10:57,828 --> 00:11:00,098
He's looking for Jang Young Mi?

79
00:11:00,637 --> 00:11:03,568
Yes, sir. He even came to Jang Entertainment.

80
00:11:37,068 --> 00:11:38,107
What happened?

81
00:11:55,218 --> 00:11:56,357
Where's Jang Young Mi?

82
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:59,588
After going out to meet with you, she never came home.

83
00:12:09,798 --> 00:12:10,808
Yes, Mr. Nam.

84
00:12:10,907 --> 00:12:13,877
I checked all the cameras on Dongjak Bridge...

85
00:12:13,877 --> 00:12:15,838
and spotted one suspicious car.

86
00:12:15,838 --> 00:12:18,907
It was present at the exact time when her phone stopped working.

87
00:12:18,907 --> 00:12:20,377
All right, I'll be on my way.

88
00:12:57,117 --> 00:12:58,747
It's the vehicle that crossed the bridge...

89
00:12:58,747 --> 00:13:00,418
at 11:53pm, and the license plate is 3791.

90
00:13:00,418 --> 00:13:01,458
It's a black car.

91
00:13:02,357 --> 00:13:03,418
That's correct.

92
00:13:07,558 --> 00:13:08,558
Okay.

93
00:13:14,598 --> 00:13:15,668
Sir.

94
00:13:18,037 --> 00:13:20,277
It's what you expected, a borrowed car.

95
00:13:20,507 --> 00:13:21,708
It's a quite common model as well.

96
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:23,708
I'm sure the car was caught on camera...

97
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:25,448
at least 1 to 2 more times.

98
00:13:25,647 --> 00:13:27,948
Please find out which way it went.

99
00:13:27,948 --> 00:13:28,978
Yes, sir.

100
00:13:29,877 --> 00:13:32,387
They disposed of her phone in the Han River.

101
00:13:32,548 --> 00:13:34,387
Where could they have taken her?

102
00:13:34,787 --> 00:13:35,887
Mr. Nam.

103
00:13:35,987 --> 00:13:37,627
Please help Young Mi's grandmother to report her missing...

104
00:13:37,627 --> 00:13:39,428
to Jang Entertainment's district police station.

105
00:13:39,588 --> 00:13:40,798
Jang Entertainment's district?

106
00:13:40,798 --> 00:13:43,058
That way, we'll be able to investigate the agency as well.

107
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:06,688
Lee Tae Kyung is trying to track her.

108
00:14:07,487 --> 00:14:09,117
I believe the vehicle was spotted on Dongjak Bridge.

109
00:14:12,688 --> 00:14:14,157
What will you do with her?

110
00:14:15,157 --> 00:14:16,598
I should take care of it.

111
00:14:18,428 --> 00:14:20,298
I can't let her go back home now.

112
00:14:51,397 --> 00:14:54,367
Ma'am, you're in the wrong place.

113
00:14:54,367 --> 00:14:56,637
You should report this to the precinct station.

114
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:59,267
She left home, saying she was meeting someone from work...

115
00:14:59,267 --> 00:15:01,137
and never came back.

116
00:15:01,678 --> 00:15:03,578
Her agency is in this district.

117
00:15:04,348 --> 00:15:07,478
It was called Jang Entertainment or something like that.

118
00:15:07,478 --> 00:15:08,678
It's that agency.

119
00:15:08,877 --> 00:15:12,188
The agency with a lot of people who are on TV.

120
00:15:12,188 --> 00:15:14,757
Ma'am, I do understand,

121
00:15:14,757 --> 00:15:16,818
but her address isn't registered in our district.

122
00:15:16,818 --> 00:15:19,787
Your granddaughter is with Jang Entertainment?

123
00:15:19,787 --> 00:15:21,627
Yes, she is.

124
00:15:21,627 --> 00:15:23,027
What's her name?

125
00:15:23,027 --> 00:15:24,668
Jang Young Mi.

126
00:15:25,627 --> 00:15:27,668
Sir, I'll take this case.

127
00:15:27,668 --> 00:15:29,537
- Please come this way. - Okay.

128
00:16:27,257 --> 00:16:28,257
Detective Ma.

129
00:16:28,828 --> 00:16:30,328
I found Jang Young Mi's diaries.

130
00:16:30,328 --> 00:16:33,127
Only the diaries for 2012 and 2019 are missing.

131
00:16:35,237 --> 00:16:36,668
2012?

132
00:16:37,367 --> 00:16:38,907
She must've written it seven years ago.

133
00:16:41,537 --> 00:16:44,048
Something about the Ahyeon-dong case might be written inside.

134
00:16:45,147 --> 00:16:47,918
I'll take them to the office and check if there's anything else.

135
00:16:47,918 --> 00:16:50,448
Okay. The last person Jang Young Mi met was...

136
00:16:50,448 --> 00:16:52,918
Jang Chi Soo. Let's check him out first.

137
00:16:53,287 --> 00:16:54,287
Okay.

138
00:17:12,468 --> 00:17:14,908
Goodness, you're driving me crazy.

139
00:17:15,408 --> 00:17:17,408
We met for work.

140
00:17:17,978 --> 00:17:18,978
Got it?

141
00:17:19,547 --> 00:17:21,017
Tell us the truth.

142
00:17:21,118 --> 00:17:23,718
Come on. You've got to be kidding me.

143
00:17:25,718 --> 00:17:28,317
How did they feel when they first took those photos?

144
00:17:32,228 --> 00:17:33,228
What?

145
00:17:34,527 --> 00:17:36,228
What did you do to them?

146
00:17:38,368 --> 00:17:40,067
What are you insinuating?

147
00:17:40,128 --> 00:17:41,698
Where is Jang Young Mi?

148
00:17:43,168 --> 00:17:44,537
Send her back home safely.

149
00:17:44,807 --> 00:17:47,478
I want her to return safely too.

150
00:17:47,478 --> 00:17:49,737
I'm begging you! Please!

151
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:53,277
To tell you the truth,

152
00:17:54,277 --> 00:17:56,017
she's not a nice girl.

153
00:17:56,317 --> 00:17:57,948
She stole my corporate card and bought expensive clothing.

154
00:17:57,948 --> 00:17:59,517
And she bolted because she got scared.

155
00:18:00,317 --> 00:18:02,087
I have evidence too.

156
00:18:02,688 --> 00:18:03,688
You know?

157
00:18:05,327 --> 00:18:07,557
Why would a girl who stole your card to buy expensive clothing...

158
00:18:09,057 --> 00:18:12,097
disappear after leaving behind those clothes at home?

159
00:18:13,827 --> 00:18:15,267
President Jang.

160
00:18:16,138 --> 00:18:18,337
You must think prosecutors are a joke.

161
00:18:22,737 --> 00:18:24,378
Give me your dashcam footage.

162
00:18:27,317 --> 00:18:29,418
Goodness, I can't believe this.

163
00:18:37,487 --> 00:18:38,928
If you don't follow her now,

164
00:18:39,257 --> 00:18:41,097
I think she might crash your car down to pieces.

165
00:18:41,898 --> 00:18:43,797
That crazy woman.

166
00:18:55,138 --> 00:18:56,378
Darn it!

167
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:00,307
What are you doing?

168
00:19:02,218 --> 00:19:05,587
The way she handles the cases is totally right up my alley.

169
00:19:08,388 --> 00:19:11,128
If there's a car accident, you must hand it over to the police.

170
00:19:11,128 --> 00:19:12,358
Decide quickly.

171
00:19:12,358 --> 00:19:14,858
Otherwise, I think she might crash your car.

172
00:19:21,698 --> 00:19:23,438
You are unbelievable.

173
00:19:43,817 --> 00:19:45,728
Send Jang Young Mi back safely.

174
00:19:46,027 --> 00:19:48,527
Then, I'll make your instigation charge disappear.

175
00:19:50,928 --> 00:19:52,968
I don't know anything about that!

176
00:19:53,597 --> 00:19:55,138
You should bring her back to me!

177
00:20:00,878 --> 00:20:04,047
We need President Jang to catch Chairman Song.

178
00:20:04,307 --> 00:20:05,847
Don't you think we used him too quickly?

179
00:20:08,218 --> 00:20:10,718
If we stall, something could happen to Jang Young Mi.

180
00:20:11,118 --> 00:20:13,688
Cha Eun Bi died within four days after she had gone missing.

181
00:20:14,718 --> 00:20:16,158
Just to be safe,

182
00:20:16,557 --> 00:20:18,487
we should do something to save her.

183
00:20:23,497 --> 00:20:24,497
Yes.

184
00:20:25,428 --> 00:20:27,128
Communication history from Jang Young Mi's phone?

185
00:20:28,037 --> 00:20:29,368
I'll check it now.

186
00:20:32,168 --> 00:20:34,478
Something is odd.

187
00:20:34,737 --> 00:20:36,577
Right before she disappeared,

188
00:20:36,577 --> 00:20:38,547
she sent a message to Lawyer Lee Tae Kyung.

189
00:20:45,047 --> 00:20:46,047
Hello.

190
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:49,158
Wait. Excuse me.

191
00:20:49,587 --> 00:20:50,587
Well...

192
00:20:51,757 --> 00:20:52,757
Gosh.

193
00:20:56,928 --> 00:20:58,997
Elaborate about the message Jang Young Mi sent to you.

194
00:20:59,527 --> 00:21:00,868
What USB?

195
00:21:01,267 --> 00:21:02,398
What does she mean...

196
00:21:04,537 --> 00:21:07,267
by she found out why Choi Soo Jeong and your brother died?

197
00:21:08,337 --> 00:21:09,337
I don't know.

198
00:21:09,678 --> 00:21:12,077
After I received that message, I couldn't reach her.

199
00:21:12,077 --> 00:21:14,347
Why did she send you this kind of message?

200
00:21:14,347 --> 00:21:16,547
She must have found out something to have sent this to you.

201
00:21:18,118 --> 00:21:19,347
I don't know either.

202
00:21:21,918 --> 00:21:25,188
If we don't find her quickly, something might happen to her.

203
00:21:27,358 --> 00:21:29,698
Let us know if you know anything that could help us find her.

204
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:35,368
Will you keep standing there?

205
00:21:35,438 --> 00:21:36,837
I'm busy now.

206
00:22:08,797 --> 00:22:09,868
Yes, Dad.

207
00:22:11,767 --> 00:22:14,108
My work performance and copy of my bankbook?

208
00:22:15,337 --> 00:22:17,237
I see. To submit to the hearing?

209
00:22:17,547 --> 00:22:19,178
Okay, I'll get them to you.

210
00:22:20,678 --> 00:22:21,678
Okay.

211
00:22:41,497 --> 00:22:43,237
Seo Yeon Ah and Lee Tae Kyung met.

212
00:22:45,938 --> 00:22:49,108
Lee Tae Kyung and Seo Yeon Ah met.

213
00:22:54,878 --> 00:22:56,247
(Lee Tae Kyung)

214
00:22:59,847 --> 00:23:02,757
(Woo Yong)

215
00:23:23,807 --> 00:23:26,307
Don't you dare make a decision by yourself next time.

216
00:23:29,448 --> 00:23:30,448
Okay.

217
00:23:32,948 --> 00:23:34,658
Is she all right?

218
00:23:36,087 --> 00:23:37,987
Don't make any mistakes. Make sure there's no problem.

219
00:23:38,787 --> 00:23:40,787
But I want to quit.

220
00:23:44,668 --> 00:23:46,728
Watching them is getting boring now.

221
00:23:49,837 --> 00:23:51,837
She will be the last one.

222
00:24:13,228 --> 00:24:15,198
Chairman Song just left.

223
00:24:16,097 --> 00:24:17,097
But...

224
00:24:18,668 --> 00:24:20,698
he said this girl will be the last.

225
00:24:22,638 --> 00:24:24,368
("Court Battle over Methanol Poison, the Lawyer Is Feeling Confident")

226
00:24:41,858 --> 00:24:43,757
It's all right.

227
00:24:44,458 --> 00:24:46,987
We can straighten it out, so don't worry too much.

228
00:24:50,497 --> 00:24:52,868
At what time does the trial start today?

229
00:24:53,428 --> 00:24:54,497
It's at 2pm.

230
00:24:56,067 --> 00:24:57,708
Discuss it among yourselves.

231
00:24:58,168 --> 00:25:01,307
The personnel who handed over the files to the opposing counsel...

232
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:02,708
And...

233
00:25:03,378 --> 00:25:05,747
The five of you can resign immediately.

234
00:25:07,077 --> 00:25:09,747
- Vice-Chairman Tak. - Someone has to be responsible.

235
00:25:11,547 --> 00:25:12,618
You may go.

236
00:25:20,158 --> 00:25:21,958
("Court Battle over...")

237
00:25:29,438 --> 00:25:31,408
This is the report on Lawyer Lee Tae Kyung.

238
00:25:38,448 --> 00:25:40,678
(Personal Information: Lee Tae Kyung)

239
00:25:43,317 --> 00:25:46,448
(Lovers with Prosecutor Seo Yeon Ah)

240
00:25:52,658 --> 00:25:56,257
(Lee Tae Ju's car accident)

241
00:26:01,668 --> 00:26:03,737
Lee Tae Kyung, you have a great story to tell.

242
00:26:13,547 --> 00:26:16,817
(Court)

243
00:26:16,817 --> 00:26:19,118
In the process of producing the cell phones,

244
00:26:19,388 --> 00:26:23,388
Jungjin failed to inform the workers of the danger of methanol,

245
00:26:23,688 --> 00:26:26,658
who were working on the CNC process when methanol flew everywhere.

246
00:26:26,987 --> 00:26:30,128
They also failed to inform them to wear any protective gear.

247
00:26:31,968 --> 00:26:33,067
Also, Jungjin...

248
00:26:33,968 --> 00:26:37,767
personally approached victims who lost their eyesight...

249
00:26:38,108 --> 00:26:41,938
and shut their mouths by making secretive agreements.

250
00:26:45,708 --> 00:26:49,047
May I turn in the evidence of victims who came to an agreement?

251
00:26:49,277 --> 00:26:50,517
Go ahead.

252
00:28:25,307 --> 00:28:27,378
Lee Tae Kyung keeps on provoking me.

253
00:28:27,817 --> 00:28:30,847
And it seems like you have no intention of persuading him.

254
00:28:32,087 --> 00:28:33,618
He's suspicious...

255
00:28:34,487 --> 00:28:37,017
of why I am against keeping the lawsuit going...

256
00:28:37,587 --> 00:28:40,228
and of my relationship with you.

257
00:28:41,458 --> 00:28:46,868
It's probably better to pretend like I'm going with his plan.

258
00:28:47,027 --> 00:28:48,198
I don't get it.

259
00:28:52,208 --> 00:28:54,507
Why do you keep letting him have the upper hand?

260
00:28:57,077 --> 00:28:58,148
If he gets too annoying,

261
00:28:59,378 --> 00:29:00,948
we can just kill him.

262
00:29:36,277 --> 00:29:38,118
Just like how his brother died seven years ago.

263
00:29:40,388 --> 00:29:43,787
Back then, you didn't tell me a lot of things.

264
00:29:47,158 --> 00:29:48,658
I wonder...

265
00:29:49,557 --> 00:29:52,368
how Lee Tae Kyung would react once he finds out...

266
00:29:52,368 --> 00:29:53,968
his dear Chairman Song killed his brother.

267
00:29:56,267 --> 00:29:57,368
Would he kill you?

268
00:29:59,337 --> 00:30:00,807
Tae Kyung isn't a guy...

269
00:30:02,037 --> 00:30:04,138
who would kill me and end it there.

270
00:30:05,908 --> 00:30:09,378
If he finds out who really killed his brother,

271
00:30:13,718 --> 00:30:16,587
I believe we are on the same boat.

272
00:30:17,087 --> 00:30:20,428
That's why I am trying very hard to take us...

273
00:30:22,097 --> 00:30:25,198
to the final destination without asking any questions.

274
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:27,398
Wouldn't the boat get to the destination...

275
00:30:28,398 --> 00:30:30,767
even if we throw out a man overboard in the journey?

276
00:30:35,737 --> 00:30:38,007
The prosecution is making suspicious moves.

277
00:30:39,777 --> 00:30:42,448
They brought up Jang Entertainment's case from seven years ago...

278
00:30:42,448 --> 00:30:43,878
and the case recently happened.

279
00:30:45,918 --> 00:30:47,347
If we do not cover it up perfectly...

280
00:30:47,347 --> 00:30:48,487
Exactly.

281
00:30:50,787 --> 00:30:51,787
But...

282
00:30:52,827 --> 00:30:55,497
I heard another person went missing from Jang Entertainment.

283
00:30:57,997 --> 00:30:59,398
It must be giving you a headache.

284
00:31:04,297 --> 00:31:06,608
I don't care about everything else.

285
00:31:07,307 --> 00:31:09,007
Take care of that lawsuit, will you?

286
00:31:09,978 --> 00:31:11,037
That way,

287
00:31:12,507 --> 00:31:14,878
everything else will go smoothly.
