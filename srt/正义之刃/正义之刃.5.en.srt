1
00:00:10,648 --> 00:00:13,578
Darn it, why is it suddenly raining?

2
00:00:15,218 --> 00:00:16,218
You're here.

3
00:00:16,549 --> 00:00:19,758
Woo Yong, I can't get a hold of that jerk, Yang Chul Ki.

4
00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:24,389
Where do you think he is?

5
00:00:39,379 --> 00:00:41,008
That dirty rat.

6
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:44,249
It looks like he's feeling guilty about something.

7
00:00:46,449 --> 00:00:47,679
Did you go to his house?

8
00:00:48,288 --> 00:00:49,288
Yes.

9
00:00:51,249 --> 00:00:53,158
Maybe I shouldn't have let him out.

10
00:00:53,889 --> 00:00:56,288
If I had kept him locked up,

11
00:00:56,629 --> 00:00:57,959
he would've told everything.

12
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:01,529
Let's look for him.

13
00:01:02,999 --> 00:01:03,999
Okay.

14
00:01:04,729 --> 00:01:05,899
Do find him for me.

15
00:01:06,339 --> 00:01:07,839
We have to find out...

16
00:01:08,408 --> 00:01:09,839
what the truth is.

17
00:01:11,908 --> 00:01:13,339
I have to know...

18
00:01:14,309 --> 00:01:15,678
why my brother died like that.

19
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,078
Don't you think so, Woo Yong?

20
00:01:42,968 --> 00:01:44,968
I can't get a hold of that jerk, Yang Chul Ki.

21
00:01:46,609 --> 00:01:47,908
Where do you think he is?

22
00:01:51,109 --> 00:01:52,178
Let's look for him.

23
00:02:14,498 --> 00:02:16,639
The most important truth...

24
00:02:17,738 --> 00:02:20,039
must be hidden away in the deepest place.

25
00:02:21,849 --> 00:02:23,879
If that is the only way...

26
00:02:24,409 --> 00:02:26,379
to protect the one who is precious to you.

27
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:33,319
Let's do it with 10,000 dollars.

28
00:02:43,969 --> 00:02:45,169
How much was it?

29
00:02:45,939 --> 00:02:47,099
That'll be 13 dollars.

30
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:50,368
Right here.

31
00:02:50,368 --> 00:02:52,208
- Goodbye. - Thank you.

32
00:03:01,678 --> 00:03:03,018
Good boy.

33
00:03:04,618 --> 00:03:06,189
Good for you.

34
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:08,558
Your dad's tough days...

35
00:03:10,729 --> 00:03:12,398
are over.

36
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:51,069
(Episode 5)

37
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:11,618
We prepared Seung Il's school and a house for you in Australia.

38
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:19,359
That's Chairman Song.

39
00:04:21,198 --> 00:04:22,698
He's such a generous man.

40
00:04:23,469 --> 00:04:24,469
You'll leave in two days.

41
00:04:42,019 --> 00:04:43,019
Honey.

42
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:58,938
Goodness, you're very impatient.

43
00:04:59,938 --> 00:05:01,298
I was going to give it to you anyway.

44
00:05:04,008 --> 00:05:05,008
What's that?

45
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:08,849
This?

46
00:05:12,548 --> 00:05:13,649
A few things.

47
00:05:15,289 --> 00:05:16,649
Some tools.

48
00:05:23,628 --> 00:05:24,859
You went somewhere?

49
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:26,428
You weren't home.

50
00:05:26,628 --> 00:05:28,229
Don't go there again.

51
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:35,868
A million dollars.

52
00:05:37,438 --> 00:05:38,678
Bring me whatever you have.

53
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:41,609
The better the information is, the more I'll bet.

54
00:05:55,829 --> 00:05:57,928
So this is how everything unfolds.

55
00:06:05,938 --> 00:06:12,979
(Ohmaltong Snack Bar)

56
00:06:25,558 --> 00:06:26,558
Mr. Nam.

57
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:28,388
Can you check if there are any flight tickets...

58
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,829
booked under the name of Yang Chul Ki or his family?

59
00:06:41,738 --> 00:06:43,469
I think he's going to run away.

60
00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:46,839
That plane to Australia leaves tomorrow.

61
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:50,678
Can you check if anyone's helping him stow away?

62
00:06:51,149 --> 00:06:52,649
Since his hometown is Busan,

63
00:06:52,649 --> 00:06:55,149
I'm sure you can find a lead in that area.

64
00:06:56,589 --> 00:06:58,188
What? Busan?

65
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,589
If you leave now, I think you can check...

66
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:04,688
three or four ports in Busan and Namhae by today.

67
00:07:11,469 --> 00:07:13,998
I want to die. He's so irritating.

68
00:07:40,758 --> 00:07:41,798
Goodness.

69
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:44,868
Thank you so much for helping me get this profitable building.

70
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,238
Thank you for doing a great job during the trial.

71
00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:50,138
Don't mention it.

72
00:07:50,868 --> 00:07:53,609
I have full control over Prosecutor Seo.

73
00:07:53,609 --> 00:07:56,048
I'll continue to keep an eye on her.

74
00:07:56,548 --> 00:07:58,849
By next year, I expect you to be the head...

75
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:00,948
of the Prosecutors' Office.

76
00:08:00,948 --> 00:08:02,048
My goodness.

77
00:08:02,789 --> 00:08:03,849
Thank you, sir.

78
00:08:06,089 --> 00:08:09,329
It seems like Prosecutor Seo is keeping an eye on that thug.

79
00:08:11,128 --> 00:08:14,399
- Please continue monitoring her. - Come on.

80
00:08:14,829 --> 00:08:17,568
I can do far more than that for you, sir.

81
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:39,089
Hey, hey!

82
00:08:39,859 --> 00:08:41,118
- That's enough! - Let me go!

83
00:08:41,118 --> 00:08:42,128
Let go!

84
00:08:44,628 --> 00:08:45,959
I'm going to catch the culprit.

85
00:08:46,628 --> 00:08:47,929
I will!

86
00:08:48,868 --> 00:08:51,128
Why are you stopping a cop from catching a culprit?

87
00:08:52,099 --> 00:08:54,038
Detective Kang's death wasn't an accident.

88
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:56,168
So why are you all turning a blind eye?

89
00:08:57,738 --> 00:08:58,778
Hey!

90
00:08:59,008 --> 00:09:01,908
You little punk. Do you want to get fired?

91
00:09:13,618 --> 00:09:15,959
When you're about to retire, you have to watch out...

92
00:09:16,429 --> 00:09:19,658
- even for the falling leaves. - Come on.

93
00:09:20,398 --> 00:09:22,469
- You're the one to talk. - Darn it.

94
00:09:22,599 --> 00:09:24,368
Cut down on drinking.

95
00:09:24,569 --> 00:09:25,939
- Gosh. - You're pretty decent...

96
00:09:25,939 --> 00:09:27,299
when you're sober.

97
00:09:27,469 --> 00:09:30,008
Do me a favor. Stop causing trouble.

98
00:09:43,018 --> 00:09:44,618
He told me not to cause trouble, but look at him now.

99
00:09:46,488 --> 00:09:47,559
That old geezer.

100
00:09:57,398 --> 00:09:58,398
You can do it with me.

101
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:00,398
That cooperative investigation or something.

102
00:10:00,638 --> 00:10:02,309
The police are refusing to look into it.

103
00:10:05,579 --> 00:10:07,038
That idiot.

104
00:10:07,878 --> 00:10:09,479
He should've listened and stopped.

105
00:10:09,748 --> 00:10:11,549
He wasn't a young, rookie cop either.

106
00:10:11,809 --> 00:10:13,449
Why did he risk his life?

107
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:16,248
Hey.

108
00:10:16,648 --> 00:10:18,089
Make sure you resolve this case.

109
00:10:20,189 --> 00:10:22,059
That culprit of the Ahyeon-dong Murder Case...

110
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,528
from seven years ago did this.

111
00:10:24,329 --> 00:10:26,128
If you don't do anything about his wrongful death,

112
00:10:27,729 --> 00:10:29,069
I won't sit back and watch.

113
00:10:31,329 --> 00:10:33,738
I get it, so you should back off.

114
00:10:33,768 --> 00:10:34,768
What?

115
00:10:34,768 --> 00:10:37,069
What can you do while being that intoxicated?

116
00:10:39,508 --> 00:10:40,508
Detective Kang also said...

117
00:10:40,508 --> 00:10:41,878
that you're useful when you're sober.

118
00:11:12,309 --> 00:11:13,378
Long time no see.

119
00:11:14,738 --> 00:11:16,179
Has it been seven years?

120
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:15,628
(I'm scared.)

121
00:13:19,998 --> 00:13:22,339
(What happened that day...)

122
00:14:05,709 --> 00:14:07,248
Have you identified the victim?

123
00:14:08,918 --> 00:14:09,988
She's from Jang Entertainment.

124
00:14:11,189 --> 00:14:12,189
She was their trainee.

125
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:14,819
"Jang Entertainment"?

126
00:14:36,949 --> 00:14:38,349
Yang Chul Ki didn't get on the plane.

127
00:14:40,979 --> 00:14:42,819
He took his family and disappeared.

128
00:14:45,189 --> 00:14:46,258
I'm sorry, sir.

129
00:14:50,929 --> 00:14:52,829
The NFS just told me that the stabbings look similar...

130
00:14:52,829 --> 00:14:54,599
to that from the Ahyeon-dong Murder Case.

131
00:14:55,459 --> 00:14:56,998
Seeing how there weren't any defense marks on both victims,

132
00:14:56,998 --> 00:14:58,768
they believe the killer is a professional.

133
00:15:01,969 --> 00:15:03,868
Did you already read over the entire case file?

134
00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:07,209
Didn't you hear him?

135
00:15:07,508 --> 00:15:10,248
I'm quite useful when I'm sober.

136
00:15:11,408 --> 00:15:13,179
Anyway, the victim from the Ahyeon-dong Murder Case...

137
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:14,518
was stabbed on the right side.

138
00:15:14,518 --> 00:15:16,689
But for this case, she was stabbed to the left.

139
00:15:16,788 --> 00:15:18,918
It's more likely that the killer is left-handed.

140
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,918
Are you sure the killer isn't trying to confuse us...

141
00:15:20,918 --> 00:15:22,258
by using both hands?

142
00:15:22,258 --> 00:15:24,288
Bingo. He's trying to dupe us.

143
00:15:24,388 --> 00:15:25,898
Judged on the appearance of the stabbings,

144
00:15:25,898 --> 00:15:27,398
it looks as if the culprits are different.

145
00:15:27,498 --> 00:15:29,028
But the methods are almost identical.

146
00:15:29,569 --> 00:15:31,898
So this killer's method is almost identical to that...

147
00:15:31,898 --> 00:15:33,668
of Yang Chul Ki's from seven years ago.

148
00:15:34,569 --> 00:15:36,569
Where was he yesterday?

149
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:39,778
He ran away. He took his family along with him.

150
00:15:39,778 --> 00:15:41,179
Put him on the wanted list this instant...

151
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:42,849
as a murder suspect.

152
00:15:42,849 --> 00:15:43,849
Bye!

153
00:15:45,049 --> 00:15:48,319
Bye!

154
00:15:48,719 --> 00:15:49,888
Bye!

155
00:16:10,368 --> 00:16:12,508
(Namwon Restaurant)

156
00:16:15,479 --> 00:16:16,778
(Namwon Restaurant)

157
00:16:16,778 --> 00:16:19,479
(Restricted Number)

158
00:16:27,589 --> 00:16:29,059
Have you been well, sir?

159
00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:34,199
This is why people should prepare for their future.

160
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:37,099
I thought it could come in handy, so I kept this around.

161
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,699
What is it that you want?

162
00:16:40,939 --> 00:16:43,339
Living a quiet life far away from this place...

163
00:16:44,109 --> 00:16:46,038
costs more than I had anticipated.

164
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:49,378
The person interested in that video made a one-million-dollar bet.

165
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:53,179
It made me wonder how big your guts are.

166
00:16:53,518 --> 00:16:55,049
Tomorrow at 8am.

167
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:56,849
I messaged you the address.

168
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:59,319
Right. Forget about doing anything fishy.

169
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:01,319
Should I call it a safety measure?

170
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:02,958
If something happens to me,

171
00:17:03,728 --> 00:17:05,489
that video will be disclosed right away.

172
00:17:21,739 --> 00:17:23,779
Prosecutor Seo put Yang Chul Ki on the wanted list.

173
00:17:56,549 --> 00:17:58,779
All right. Let's make this simple.

174
00:17:58,779 --> 00:18:00,878
If you don't find the whereabouts of Yang Chul Ki by today,

175
00:18:00,878 --> 00:18:05,019
you'll be locked up for assault, blackmailing, extortion, and so on.

176
00:18:05,019 --> 00:18:06,418
No leniency on your charges. Okay?

177
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,819
Given the circumstance, he'll try to stow away from Korea.

178
00:18:08,819 --> 00:18:10,958
He'll be looking for phones and cars under borrowed names.

179
00:18:11,628 --> 00:18:13,928
Hey, you. I'm basically spoon-feeding you this.

180
00:18:13,928 --> 00:18:15,728
You'll find him soon enough if you keep your eyes open.

181
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:17,569
Try your best.

182
00:18:18,569 --> 00:18:20,168
- Got it? - Yes.

183
00:18:24,239 --> 00:18:26,579
Darn it. That jerk.

184
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:28,539
Hey, let's go.

185
00:18:34,918 --> 00:18:35,918
Your jjajangmyeon is here.

186
00:18:36,688 --> 00:18:38,519
Hey, I'm looking for a guy.

187
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:39,958
You know Yang Chul Ki, right?

188
00:18:39,958 --> 00:18:41,188
Tell them we're looking for him.

189
00:18:41,188 --> 00:18:42,928
Okay. Do that for me.

190
00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:44,289
I don't want it. Take it over there.

191
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,759
- What about the ships? - No.

192
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:47,898
- What if he already left by ship? - Put one over here.

193
00:18:47,898 --> 00:18:51,398
- Hang up. - Come on, I told you to hurry up.

194
00:18:51,398 --> 00:18:52,599
- One over here. - Hey, just hang up.

195
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:54,769
- Darn it. - Let's eat and work.

196
00:18:54,769 --> 00:18:56,368
I already called places he could be at.

197
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:58,569
- Yes. I'm looking for a man. - Let's get to work.

198
00:18:58,769 --> 00:18:59,779
Hello?

199
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:03,309
Where do you think? I'm in Busan now.

200
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:05,208
I'm going to head over to Pohang after checking out Ulsan.

201
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:06,218
You know Yang Chul Ki, right?

202
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:08,978
Goodness, these are all thugs.

203
00:19:08,978 --> 00:19:10,789
It's going to cost a lot of money.

204
00:19:11,418 --> 00:19:12,648
- Yes. - Sir.

205
00:19:12,688 --> 00:19:14,489
What is it? Hold on a second.

206
00:19:14,489 --> 00:19:15,688
Let me call you back.

207
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:18,089
Sir.

208
00:19:21,698 --> 00:19:23,898
Goodness, you punk.

209
00:19:23,898 --> 00:19:29,339
Is it impossible for you to accept my love?

210
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:33,408
You're Mona Lisa

211
00:19:33,408 --> 00:19:36,378
I don't like that look on your face

212
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:43,519
Is it impossible for you to accept my love?

213
00:19:44,218 --> 00:19:46,489
You're Mona Lisa

214
00:19:46,489 --> 00:19:50,989
Mona Lisa, you're making me sad

215
00:19:55,829 --> 00:19:56,829
Yes?

216
00:20:03,309 --> 00:20:04,339
They stowed away?

217
00:20:04,339 --> 00:20:07,079
Yes. He only sent his family away.

218
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:09,549
He's the only one staying in this country.

219
00:20:10,948 --> 00:20:13,749
- What about his whereabouts? - I told them to look into that.

220
00:20:14,418 --> 00:20:17,289
But why do you think he decided to stay behind without his family?

221
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:19,559
He must have something to do here.

222
00:20:20,718 --> 00:20:22,759
Let me know as soon as you locate him.

223
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:23,829
Okay.

224
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,478
That rat, Yang Chul Ki.

225
00:20:40,478 --> 00:20:42,279
I offered a deal with him, but he hasn't gotten back to me.

226
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:44,648
- A deal? - Yes.

227
00:20:45,049 --> 00:20:46,148
I sweet-talked him...

228
00:20:46,148 --> 00:20:47,878
that I'd give him a million dollars for information on Tae Ju's death.

229
00:20:47,878 --> 00:20:49,888
That rat likes money, you know.

230
00:20:50,718 --> 00:20:52,749
Did someone give him a load of cash?

231
00:20:54,188 --> 00:20:56,158
Gosh, that's hurting my pride.

232
00:20:56,158 --> 00:20:58,029
I'm loaded too. Aren't I?

233
00:21:07,138 --> 00:21:08,269
Yes, Mr. Nam.

234
00:21:08,438 --> 00:21:11,138
Yang Chul Ki has started to move now.

235
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:15,079
Okay, I got it. I'm on my way now.

236
00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:21,618
No one can get things done at my office without me.

237
00:21:21,618 --> 00:21:22,989
I wanted to talk to you.

238
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:24,349
Bye, Woo Yong.

239
00:22:01,218 --> 00:22:03,388
How did you manage to locate Yang Chul Ki all of a sudden?

240
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:05,188
This isn't sudden.

241
00:22:05,188 --> 00:22:06,859
It's the fruit of my hard labor...

242
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:09,158
and fruit of my long list of friends.

243
00:22:10,999 --> 00:22:11,999
I already put him on the wanted list.

244
00:22:11,999 --> 00:22:13,468
Let's arrest him as soon as we see him.

245
00:22:13,468 --> 00:22:15,368
I got you, you jerk.

246
00:23:42,158 --> 00:23:43,158
Darn it.

247
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:16,458
Catch him. Get him now!

248
00:24:18,628 --> 00:24:19,928
- Make sure you get him. - Hey.

249
00:24:21,499 --> 00:24:22,499
Let go!

250
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,128
Catch him.

251
00:24:43,448 --> 00:24:45,118
What was that?

252
00:24:45,749 --> 00:24:46,759
Darn.

253
00:24:59,668 --> 00:25:00,898
No!

254
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:06,009
That crazy scumbag.

255
00:26:02,059 --> 00:26:04,868
Darn you, Chairman Song.

256
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:17,378
I told you...

257
00:26:17,579 --> 00:26:19,579
that I'll kill you if you try something funny again.

258
00:26:19,749 --> 00:26:22,319
Prosecutor Seo. Prosecutor Seo is after me.

259
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:25,249
I'm on the wanted list, so if I get caught now...

260
00:26:25,589 --> 00:26:27,418
If I get caught now, you won't be able to find anything.

261
00:26:28,388 --> 00:26:30,589
You jerk. Do you really want to die?

262
00:26:31,228 --> 00:26:33,198
Did you think I would believe everything you say?

263
00:26:45,739 --> 00:26:47,579
Mr. Lee. Look behind you.

264
00:27:00,789 --> 00:27:03,489
They aren't the real culprits who killed your brother.

265
00:27:06,628 --> 00:27:08,829
The real culprit is someone else.

266
00:27:10,698 --> 00:27:13,638
Bring me 1.5 million won. I'll give you the evidence.

267
00:27:16,239 --> 00:27:17,408
What brings you here?

268
00:27:17,408 --> 00:27:20,079
Oh, goodness, hello. I can't believe I ran into you.

269
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:23,749
I'm looking for a restroom.

270
00:27:25,408 --> 00:27:26,849
This is your last chance.

271
00:27:28,049 --> 00:27:30,249
If you mess around once again, it's really over.

272
00:27:38,658 --> 00:27:39,728
Darn it!

273
00:27:39,928 --> 00:27:40,928
He's there!
