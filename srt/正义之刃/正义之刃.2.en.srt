00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:03,320
(Episode 2)

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:04,890
(True correction, bright future)

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:10,160
(Visiting Room 1, Visiting Room 2)

4
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:21,010
Name, Yang Chul Ki. Occupation, a gangster.

5
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:23,410
Seven previous convictions.

6
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:24,749
What an expert.

7
00:00:24,749 --> 00:00:25,910
Are you planning on becoming a professional?

8
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,779
So some thugs got into a fight because of a holdout problem...

9
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:31,190
and you got arrested in the action.

10
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:32,650
You were arrested immediately because of your previous charges.

11
00:00:34,819 --> 00:00:37,660
Gosh, your uniform fits you perfectly.

12
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:38,790
It's pretty much tailored for you.

13
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,860
Goodness, what an honor.

14
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,730
A star attorney came here.

15
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:43,800
Do you know me?

16
00:00:44,499 --> 00:00:46,400
Then I won't beat around the bush.

17
00:00:46,999 --> 00:00:49,139
I will make the story about how a poor thug...

18
00:00:49,139 --> 00:00:51,340
got into this case by accident trying to make a living...

19
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:53,709
for his sick mother, siblings, wife, and even children.

20
00:00:53,709 --> 00:00:55,710
My dear actor, you need to polish up your acting skills.

21
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,549
You jerk. Stop trampling all over me.

22
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,219
Man, you stupid thug...

23
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:04,320
don't get it because I skipped over the middle, right?

24
00:01:05,389 --> 00:01:06,389
Why do you think...

25
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:09,820
someone is trying to get a useless thug like you...

26
00:01:09,919 --> 00:01:11,689
out of this case...

27
00:01:11,689 --> 00:01:13,359
by using an expensive attorney like me?

28
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:17,460
Because...

29
00:01:17,999 --> 00:01:19,630
you're a rotten link.

30
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:22,040
It's because of the body that's connected to the rotten link.

31
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,299
I'm not trying to get you out.

32
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:25,240
- What did you say, jerk? - So you must...

33
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,340
do your best to act your part.

34
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,139
If there is trouble because of your acting,

35
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,880
then you will get dropped right away...

36
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:34,419
so that the body won't get in trouble.

37
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,120
Understood?

38
00:01:41,889 --> 00:01:42,889
Okay.

39
00:01:46,059 --> 00:01:49,159
Mr. Guk, about the indictment of the assembly's son...

40
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,189
You think your boss is a joke, don't you?

41
00:02:12,789 --> 00:02:14,090
"Don't worry"?

42
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,420
You need to withdraw the indictment.

43
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:17,659
I don't think...

44
00:02:18,729 --> 00:02:20,159
I can do that.

45
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,469
I wasn't going to do my best either.

46
00:02:24,469 --> 00:02:25,969
But he used violence regularly,

47
00:02:25,969 --> 00:02:28,270
and this was special violence because he broke a bottle and all.

48
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:30,069
I couldn't go without indicting him.

49
00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:31,469
You said it yourself.

50
00:02:31,469 --> 00:02:33,309
That no one said they were beaten up.

51
00:02:33,309 --> 00:02:34,680
I looked into this,

52
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,110
and the victim was his driver.

53
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:38,210
He was afraid he'd get fired, so he couldn't make a statement.

54
00:02:38,979 --> 00:02:41,819
I couldn't just overlook the truth. I'm a prosecutor.

55
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,990
Your father's hearing is coming up.

56
00:02:46,289 --> 00:02:47,550
Let's not cause him any trouble.

57
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,289
My father will manage his own business.

58
00:02:56,259 --> 00:03:00,430
Even if I turn this case inside out to reveal the whole truth about him,

59
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,200
it'll be stopped by those above anyway.

60
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:04,300
Even if I end up indicting the case,

61
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,210
the court will find him innocent.

62
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,779
But lately, I've been addicted to social media.

63
00:03:11,779 --> 00:03:12,909
Seo Yeon Ah!

64
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:19,090
But a case that involves this kind of boys isn't exactly my style.

65
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,390
What do you want?

66
00:03:25,059 --> 00:03:26,830
Wait, Mr. Lee!

67
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:28,659
- What? - This is bad.

68
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:31,870
The prosecutor for the trial was just reappointed.

69
00:03:32,029 --> 00:03:33,029
Who is it?

70
00:03:33,029 --> 00:03:34,170
Long time no see.

71
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:42,039
Hello.

72
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:44,979
What has gotten into you?

73
00:03:44,979 --> 00:03:47,479
You're a star attorney who defends the top one percent of this country.

74
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:49,379
Why are you defending this useless thug?

75
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,650
Right.

76
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,960
Yang Chul Ki works for Bumjung Construction, right?

77
00:04:11,469 --> 00:04:12,710
Have you been well?

78
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,210
We haven't met since our days in the Seoul Eastern District Office.

79
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,880
Thanks to you, I was transferred to a place with awfully fresh air.

80
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,119
You're the ace prosecutor of Seoul Central Prosecutors’ Office,

81
00:04:22,219 --> 00:04:25,289
and I'm worried you might work too hard over some thug's case.

82
00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:28,489
Chairman Song, it must be annoyed to have these thugs cause trouble.

83
00:04:28,489 --> 00:04:31,529
Why don't you quit your business and start a law firm?

84
00:04:31,789 --> 00:04:34,830
I heard you're the only way that Mr. Lee will take any cases.

85
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,630
You'll make much more than your current construction company.

86
00:04:38,469 --> 00:04:40,270
I need to think carefully before I change my business.

87
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:43,270
I can just do something that'll make a lot of profit.

88
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:47,469
Figures. You're very good at business.

89
00:04:47,539 --> 00:04:49,340
A company that only has capital of one million dollars...

90
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:52,080
manage to get construction projects worth 200 million dollars, right?

91
00:04:55,219 --> 00:04:56,219
Let's go.

92
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:58,390
While we're at it, Mr. Lee.

93
00:05:00,789 --> 00:05:02,659
You'll have to use the actual law to deal with this case...

94
00:05:02,659 --> 00:05:04,590
instead of using your dirty tricks.

95
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,260
I'm not going to give up...

96
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,299
even if we both end up rolling around in a ditch.

97
00:05:08,299 --> 00:05:09,560
You know me, don't you?

98
00:05:10,229 --> 00:05:12,070
I never let anything go once I take a bite.

99
00:05:16,169 --> 00:05:17,169
Goodbye.

100
00:05:24,239 --> 00:05:25,950
She's still so cool.

101
00:05:29,179 --> 00:05:30,820
Aren't you here to look at the trial?

102
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:33,419
I'm just here to visit the top floor.

103
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:38,060
(Customs)

104
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:41,529
Witness, you bought just 7m² of land...

105
00:05:41,529 --> 00:05:43,900
in the redevelopment site of the defendant's company.

106
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,130
And you requested 30 percent...

107
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:49,299
of the construction profit for selling your land to them.

108
00:05:49,539 --> 00:05:52,469
This is called a holdout technique.

109
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,609
- Is that correct? - It's not exactly a holdout.

110
00:05:55,609 --> 00:05:56,810
Just answer with the facts.

111
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:59,510
Did you request to get 30 percent back or not?

112
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,210
I did. I did but...

113
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:03,450
Because of this wicked trick,

114
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:06,390
the construction plan began to get postponed.

115
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:10,020
Finally, the defendant, an employee of the company, stepped in.

116
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,020
Why?

117
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:15,700
Because many laborers' livelihood depended on this construction.

118
00:06:17,299 --> 00:06:18,869
If the business gets canceled,

119
00:06:19,469 --> 00:06:21,770
they have no choice but to live out on the streets.

120
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,570
Some of them need to look after their sick mother.

121
00:06:25,869 --> 00:06:28,440
Some of them were a father who had to get his baby's formula.

122
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:30,409
The defendant was...

123
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,380
also a head of a household too.

124
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,779
He could not ignore those laborers and their livelihood.

125
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,890
Please take into consideration that he got involved...

126
00:06:39,219 --> 00:06:40,789
in this assault case against his will.

127
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,260
That's all.

128
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:47,460
It was a dirty fight.

129
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,330
Who's going to take more?

130
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,500
A bloody survival game between thugs.

131
00:06:56,169 --> 00:06:59,869
If Bumjung Construction actually cared about day laborers,

132
00:07:00,109 --> 00:07:02,109
they wouldn't have created a labor team of thugs...

133
00:07:02,109 --> 00:07:03,979
and gave them...

134
00:07:03,979 --> 00:07:06,310
seven percents as the commission.

135
00:07:07,349 --> 00:07:08,349
Your Honor.

136
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:11,789
You must know that Bumjung Construction is...

137
00:07:11,789 --> 00:07:13,450
behind this assault case,

138
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:16,060
who created a team of thugs just for their own benefits.

139
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,529
The defendant, Yang Chul Ki, was the leader of that team.

140
00:07:19,659 --> 00:07:21,229
He has seven previous convictions...

141
00:07:21,229 --> 00:07:22,700
for assault, blackmailing, threat,

142
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,429
extortion, obstructing businesses, and et cetera.

143
00:07:29,539 --> 00:07:32,140
He is also a key suspect of an unresolved murder case.

144
00:07:44,549 --> 00:07:46,919
Goodness, a murder case.

145
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:49,159
I think we took a big blow.

146
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,859
If she suddenly took this case,

147
00:07:51,859 --> 00:07:53,789
does this mean she did that on purpose?

148
00:07:54,799 --> 00:07:56,000
Can you investigate...

149
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,130
what Yang Chul Ki's murder case is about?

150
00:07:58,169 --> 00:07:59,169
Sure.

151
00:07:59,169 --> 00:08:00,169
(Court)

152
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:07,609
Detective Kang, you investigated Yang Chul Ki's case?

153
00:08:08,109 --> 00:08:09,109
I see.

154
00:08:09,109 --> 00:08:11,909
You two have been working together ever since she was appointed.

155
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:14,310
He brought it to me two weeks ago.

156
00:08:14,679 --> 00:08:16,179
It's a case that kept on troubling me...

157
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,090
as I was nearing my retirement,

158
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:19,750
so I began to investigate it again.

159
00:08:20,989 --> 00:08:22,859
It definitely seems odd.

160
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:24,690
This is...

161
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:27,830
the unresolved case from seven years ago.

162
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,700
It seemed very odd.

163
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,229
(Ahyeon-dong Murder Case)

164
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:40,109
(2012, Ahyeon-dong Choi Soo Jeong Murder Case)

165
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:43,410
(Ju Hyeon: Take the package straight to the police, and don't be scared!)

166
00:11:34,749 --> 00:11:37,780
She was a 20-year-old actress who had just made her debut.

167
00:11:38,889 --> 00:11:40,749
Seeing how she was stabbed in her vital spot,

168
00:11:40,749 --> 00:11:43,320
the killer seemed to be a professional.

169
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,160
But the murder weapon wasn't found,

170
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,830
and there were no traces of sexual assault.

171
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:57,369
Yang Chul Ki is the key suspect.

172
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,670
He was the only one who went to her place.

173
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:03,509
Her estimated time of death and his whereabouts overlap.

174
00:12:04,109 --> 00:12:06,680
On top of that, his prints were found on her body.

175
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,849
But he was acquitted just like that.

176
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,050
Since the murder weapon wasn't found,

177
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,690
there's no proof of the murder.

178
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,349
As for the prints on her body,

179
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:17,359
they could've been easily explained since he was her manager.

180
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:18,729
The absence of his motive for murder...

181
00:12:18,729 --> 00:12:19,859
must be a critical fact.

182
00:12:19,859 --> 00:12:23,629
In one week, the police closed down this case.

183
00:12:23,629 --> 00:12:26,830
But what's stranger is that as soon as the case was closed,

184
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:29,800
the CCTV footages and files related to the case...

185
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,239
were destroyed.

186
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:33,410
This was intentional.

187
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:36,810
He was put behind bars for a simple assault case,

188
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:38,879
and now, she wants to solve a cold case?

189
00:12:40,149 --> 00:12:41,180
What?

190
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:42,479
That's just like her.

191
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:51,219
They could've just let me investigate it...

192
00:12:51,219 --> 00:12:52,930
since I was going to retire soon anyway,

193
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:54,960
but strangely enough, they kept pressuring me to drop it.

194
00:12:55,259 --> 00:12:59,070
I thought seeing a prosecutor would be better than a detective,

195
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:00,269
so I came to you.

196
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:03,599
A 20-year-old woman died,

197
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,840
but there was no motive for murder.

198
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,070
Seven years have passed,

199
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,879
but they still pressured you.

200
00:13:14,979 --> 00:13:18,280
That means there's a mastermind behind Yang Chul Ki.

204
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,629
People talked about this in SNS for a long time.

205
00:13:35,369 --> 00:13:37,269
Online newspaper companies like ours...

206
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:39,570
thrive on stimulating news.

207
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,680
There are rumors that the key suspect of that case...

208
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,310
is an employee at Bumjung Construction.

209
00:13:49,649 --> 00:13:51,479
The deeper I dug, the more interesting it got.

210
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:53,119
One more thing.

211
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,989
While looking into the case, I found that.

212
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:02,599
That was interesting too.

213
00:14:04,129 --> 00:14:06,499
I heard that many small online newspaper companies...

214
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:11,300
go under in a blink of an eye.

215
00:14:13,369 --> 00:14:16,940

216
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,869

I'll be seeing you often.

218
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:02,119
I didn't kill her!

219
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:04,389
Why are you all worked up?

220
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:15,869
Since I was her manager, I frequented her house.

221
00:15:15,869 --> 00:15:17,670
When I went there, she was already dead.

222
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,969
She was already dead?

223
00:15:18,969 --> 00:15:20,469
Yes. Do you think I'm insane?

224
00:15:20,469 --> 00:15:22,540
Why would I report my own murder...

225
00:15:22,739 --> 00:15:25,009
and let the CCTV camera record me on my way out?

226
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:28,580
The police interrogated me, and I was acquitted.

227
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,379
- Acquitted? - Exactly.

228
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:34,719
Who acquitted you?

229
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,259
What are you trying to do?

230
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:42,129
Nothing.

Woo Yong, that punk, Yang Chul Ki,

237
00:16:12,859 --> 00:16:14,859
seems to be involved in a murder.

238
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:16,499
That's not related to this, right?

239
00:16:17,599 --> 00:16:18,830
What if it is?

240
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,269
If it is, you shouldn't worry about that...

241
00:16:24,269 --> 00:16:27,369

242
00:16:27,739 --> 00:16:29,940
It doesn't matter if he committed something worse...

243
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:32,080
because I'm going to get him out.

244
00:16:32,749 --> 00:16:36,519
We wouldn't care even if he did commit that murder.

I love that you compensate me so quickly.

253
00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:22,260
You should visit him. It's his birthday today.

254
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:42,820
Ma'am.

256
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,790
I stumbled across this.

257

- Who is this? - He's a delivery man.

258
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:54,189
He was at the crime scene during the estimated time of the crime.

259
00:17:58,629 --> 00:18:00,199
Delivery. Are you in?

260
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,500
These are files related to the case.

261
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,040
They were mixed up elsewhere, so they weren't discarded.

268
00:19:40,099 --> 00:19:42,030
Why did you ask for the land here?

269
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:46,770
Is this where you used to live?

270
00:19:46,909 --> 00:19:47,970
It'd be nice...

271
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:50,740
if I can fix up this poor neighborhood.

272
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,209

273
00:19:56,679 --> 00:19:57,879

00:33:22,849 --> 00:33:24,320
Can you check where he went?

362
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,830
Hey, isn't this Yang Chul Ki?

363
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:29,359
Please explain why the prosecutor in charge has changed.

364
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:30,399
This is outside pressure.

365
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:31,500
Do you think the organization is a joke?

366
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,669
Why are you trying to get Yang Chul Ki out?

367
00:33:33,669 --> 00:33:35,000
Nothing will change.

368
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,970
Even if you find out more, the choice we made cannot change.

369
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:40,310
Do you want to know how your brother died?

370
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:42,609
You will have to get me out of here.

371
00:33:42,609 --> 00:33:43,679
Defendant's attorney?

372
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,480
I will not make any counter-argument.
