1
00:00:01,016 --> 00:00:02,577
(Episode 4)

2
00:00:08,616 --> 00:00:10,357
I kept on investigating the case,

3
00:00:10,357 --> 00:00:12,956
and it looks like Yang Chul Ki is definitely the murderer.

4
00:00:13,186 --> 00:00:15,596
The evidence is clear as day.

5
00:00:15,596 --> 00:00:18,967
Someone definitely helped him out in the process.

6
00:00:25,267 --> 00:00:26,676
- Mr. Nam. - Yes?

7
00:00:27,907 --> 00:00:29,837
On the day of the Ahyeon-dong Murder Case,

8
00:00:29,837 --> 00:00:32,007
a delivery man was apparently there as well.

9
00:00:32,947 --> 00:00:34,676
Could you check it out?

10
00:00:34,676 --> 00:00:35,676
A delivery man?

11
00:00:35,676 --> 00:00:37,117
Since it's been seven years,

12
00:00:37,117 --> 00:00:39,487
I doubt there would be any documents or CCTV footages.

13
00:00:39,547 --> 00:00:41,386
But please look into it just in case.

14
00:00:41,386 --> 00:00:43,426
Check if he met anyone...

15
00:00:43,426 --> 00:00:44,886
on his way home...

16
00:00:45,187 --> 00:00:47,026
from the crime scene...

17
00:00:47,127 --> 00:00:50,826
or stopped by anywhere. Look for everything.

18
00:00:50,826 --> 00:00:53,437
But I don't get the correlation between that delivery man...

19
00:00:53,437 --> 00:00:55,496
and the murder case...

20
00:00:56,606 --> 00:00:59,236
He doesn't reply back when I talk.

21
00:00:59,406 --> 00:01:01,076
My gosh.

22
00:01:07,876 --> 00:01:08,977
- Hello, sir. - Hello.

23
00:01:08,977 --> 00:01:13,356
How many CCTV cameras do you have in this building?

24
00:01:13,617 --> 00:01:15,457
I'm not sure about that.

25
00:01:20,326 --> 00:01:21,356
(13:05pm to 14:00pm, November 21, 2012,)

26
00:01:21,356 --> 00:01:22,356
(deliveries in the direction of Star Hostel)

27
00:01:43,986 --> 00:01:45,917
There are three outside...

28
00:01:45,917 --> 00:01:48,057
- and one inside, right? - That's correct.

29
00:01:48,057 --> 00:01:49,817
- Is that one for the elevator? - Yes.

30
00:01:49,817 --> 00:01:52,787
For how many years are the archives stored?

31
00:02:09,606 --> 00:02:11,447
They're not in chronological order...

32
00:02:11,447 --> 00:02:13,046
since he's stored all the records from the past decade.

33
00:02:13,046 --> 00:02:15,616
The dates aren't marked, so it'll be difficult.

34
00:02:15,747 --> 00:02:16,886
That's fine.

35
00:02:17,646 --> 00:02:18,687
Thank you.

36
00:02:19,646 --> 00:02:22,287
There are two CCTV cameras.

37
00:02:25,986 --> 00:02:30,197
(Fax, lamination, copy)

38
00:02:48,116 --> 00:02:49,116
All right.

39
00:02:53,046 --> 00:02:57,326
Oh, my. This is no joke.

40
00:03:43,437 --> 00:03:44,467
What?

41
00:03:47,706 --> 00:03:49,477
What? Hold on.

42
00:03:50,277 --> 00:03:52,106
I recognize that face.

43
00:03:53,877 --> 00:03:55,217
Give me a minute.

44
00:04:00,787 --> 00:04:02,317
Wait, look at her.

45
00:04:03,157 --> 00:04:04,956
Do you recognize her?

46
00:04:05,386 --> 00:04:06,556
It's her.

47
00:04:07,257 --> 00:04:09,426
She's the one from the trial.

48
00:04:13,637 --> 00:04:15,436
Don't we have the same one from a different angle?

49
00:04:15,436 --> 00:04:17,137
From where she was walking from?

50
00:04:17,137 --> 00:04:18,366
Yes, we do.

51
00:04:34,887 --> 00:04:35,917
Hold on.

52
00:04:36,517 --> 00:04:38,657
Isn't that Yang Chul Ki?

53
00:04:42,027 --> 00:04:43,256
Do you have her number?

54
00:04:50,537 --> 00:04:52,407
Go in. Bye.

55
00:05:18,027 --> 00:05:19,667
I have one question.

56
00:05:19,727 --> 00:05:21,097
You know Yang Chul Ki, don't you?

57
00:05:26,606 --> 00:05:28,777
You've met this delivery man seven years ago.

58
00:05:30,577 --> 00:05:32,946
The delivery man gave you a parcel, and you handed it to Yang Chul Ki.

59
00:05:35,717 --> 00:05:37,186
Why did you meet him on that day?

60
00:05:39,546 --> 00:05:40,556
I don't remember.

61
00:05:40,556 --> 00:05:43,356
This is very important to me, so please answer.

62
00:05:44,027 --> 00:05:46,126
- What was inside the parcel? - Why should I tell you?

63
00:05:46,126 --> 00:05:48,356
It may be important to you, but what does it have to do with me?

64
00:05:51,767 --> 00:05:53,066
I'll pay you handsomely.

65
00:05:58,637 --> 00:05:59,667
Get lost.

66
00:06:00,936 --> 00:06:02,707
Why did you meet Yang Chul Ki?

67
00:06:04,347 --> 00:06:05,446
Just tell me that.

68
00:06:10,046 --> 00:06:12,087
If you're dying to know, ask him yourself.

69
00:06:12,087 --> 00:06:13,957
And don't you dare come see me ever again.

70
00:06:16,116 --> 00:06:17,387
You scumbag.

71
00:07:49,217 --> 00:07:52,517
A lawyer who's famous is different, indeed.

72
00:07:53,856 --> 00:07:55,686
Thanks to you, I get to come here.

73
00:08:11,236 --> 00:08:12,767
You must want to know something,

74
00:08:13,907 --> 00:08:15,306
seeing how you're here this late at night.

75
00:08:16,106 --> 00:08:18,176
If I don't get you out of prison,

76
00:08:19,407 --> 00:08:21,277
what do you think Prosecutor Seo would do to you?

77
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:27,357
Would she be able to find evidence for the murder or not?

78
00:08:28,357 --> 00:08:29,657
I'm curious.

79
00:08:30,316 --> 00:08:32,086
What did that crazy wench tell you?

80
00:08:36,897 --> 00:08:40,936
You're right. Prosecutor Seo is one crazy wench, isn't she?

81
00:08:43,907 --> 00:08:45,466
By the way, on the day of the murder,

82
00:08:46,167 --> 00:08:47,436
you met with Jang Young Mi.

83
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:56,247
So what?

84
00:08:57,686 --> 00:09:00,586
She also met someone else apart from you.

85
00:09:05,456 --> 00:09:07,397
I have no idea what you're blabbering on about.

86
00:09:08,527 --> 00:09:09,757
Is that right?

87
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:13,226
If that's the case, don't you worry.

88
00:09:13,226 --> 00:09:15,066
You can take your time remembering what happened...

89
00:09:15,066 --> 00:09:16,596
while rotting in prison.

90
00:09:22,007 --> 00:09:24,176
Chairman Song would want you to take me out of here.

91
00:09:27,917 --> 00:09:31,517
Why did you meet her on that day? Tell me.

92
00:09:31,987 --> 00:09:35,157
And what was in the parcel that the delivery man gave?

93
00:09:37,527 --> 00:09:38,556
I'm not sure.

94
00:09:41,226 --> 00:09:44,367
Being imprisoned for too long has failed my memory.

95
00:09:45,696 --> 00:09:47,196
I can't remember.

96
00:09:54,637 --> 00:09:56,637
(Court of Criminal Division 3)

97
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:59,806
Defendant Yang Chul Ki has committed similar assaults...

98
00:10:00,076 --> 00:10:03,617
2 years ago and 6 months ago as well.

99
00:10:04,316 --> 00:10:06,686
His reason was that the laborers didn't give...

100
00:10:06,686 --> 00:10:07,757
the right amount of commission.

101
00:10:08,157 --> 00:10:11,056
It's highly unlikely that he was trying to protect...

102
00:10:11,056 --> 00:10:13,357
the laborers as their team leader.

103
00:10:13,657 --> 00:10:16,157
I hope you acknowledge that this is...

104
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,796
a habitual special assault case committed by a thug...

105
00:10:17,796 --> 00:10:19,296
with seven previous convictions...

106
00:10:19,296 --> 00:10:20,596
because of privilege on a construction company.

107
00:10:21,596 --> 00:10:22,596
That is all.

108
00:10:26,767 --> 00:10:27,836
Defense?

109
00:10:28,607 --> 00:10:29,607
Proceed.

110
00:10:39,546 --> 00:10:40,816
I will not...

111
00:10:45,726 --> 00:10:46,887
make any counter-argument.

112
00:10:57,537 --> 00:10:58,737
What are you trying to get at?

113
00:10:59,107 --> 00:11:01,137
Do I have to tell the prosecutor about my strategy?

114
00:11:01,137 --> 00:11:02,777
You're not going to get Yang Chul Ki out, right?

115
00:11:03,436 --> 00:11:05,046
I'm sure the murder case is related to your brother's...

116
00:11:05,046 --> 00:11:07,147
Stop paying attention to my brother's case.

117
00:11:07,147 --> 00:11:09,816
I don't plan on getting you involved. And this case...

118
00:11:10,517 --> 00:11:11,987
is an assault case, not a murder case.

119
00:11:11,987 --> 00:11:13,686
Then, defend him only for the assault case.

120
00:11:14,056 --> 00:11:15,757
I will look into the murder case.

121
00:11:39,747 --> 00:11:42,277
(Restricted Number)

122
00:12:09,607 --> 00:12:11,346
I guess your memory is coming back to you now.

123
00:12:20,446 --> 00:12:21,657
How are they related?

124
00:12:24,926 --> 00:12:26,787
The girl who died in Ahyeon-dong.

125
00:12:28,056 --> 00:12:29,956
And the delivery man who died in a car accident.

126
00:12:31,897 --> 00:12:32,897
Are you curious...

127
00:12:34,096 --> 00:12:35,867
about how your little brother died?

128
00:12:37,836 --> 00:12:39,137
What do you mean?

129
00:12:42,107 --> 00:12:43,907
I asked you a question, you jerk.

130
00:12:46,407 --> 00:12:47,877
I can't believe...

131
00:12:49,476 --> 00:12:50,846
the Almighty Lee Tae Kyung is all worked up.

132
00:12:51,617 --> 00:12:52,716
What is it?

133
00:12:53,846 --> 00:12:55,257
I thought it didn't matter.

134
00:12:56,086 --> 00:12:58,657
How are you involved in my brother's case?

135
00:12:59,787 --> 00:13:01,157
I'm not involved at all.

136
00:13:01,757 --> 00:13:03,757
I couldn't care less about how a mere delivery man...

137
00:13:04,497 --> 00:13:05,966
died.

138
00:13:15,706 --> 00:13:17,377
I'm pretty sure you will rot here...

139
00:13:18,277 --> 00:13:19,476
for the rest of your life.

140
00:13:22,316 --> 00:13:23,417
Come on.

141
00:13:26,046 --> 00:13:27,586
You will have to get me out of here...

142
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:30,757
no matter what.

143
00:13:45,167 --> 00:13:47,007
Will Lee Tae Kyung get Yang Chul Ki out?

144
00:13:47,907 --> 00:13:49,436
Once he finds out everything...

145
00:13:49,436 --> 00:13:52,846
I knew that he was a tiger cub when I took him in.

146
00:13:53,576 --> 00:13:56,147
The wind is bound to shake things up.

147
00:13:57,987 --> 00:13:59,546
I can't defy nature.

148
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:44,566
You crazy jerk. This is too expensive.

149
00:14:44,566 --> 00:14:46,367
Stop acting like a country boy.

150
00:14:46,367 --> 00:14:48,137
You're going to be a fancy lawyer.

151
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,336
You should act like one.

152
00:14:49,336 --> 00:14:50,767
Once you become a lawyer,

153
00:14:50,767 --> 00:14:52,066
you should suit up.

154
00:14:53,037 --> 00:14:55,877
Don't you know that a good tie completes a suit?

155
00:14:55,877 --> 00:14:58,247
Goodness. You don't know anything.

156
00:14:58,446 --> 00:15:00,346
I didn't pass the third round yet.

157
00:15:00,346 --> 00:15:01,617
Well, you'll pass...

158
00:15:01,846 --> 00:15:04,247
as long as you don't curse out the interviewer.

159
00:15:04,546 --> 00:15:05,546
No?

160
00:15:06,487 --> 00:15:07,487
Open it up.

161
00:15:07,956 --> 00:15:09,917
- Why? - Do you see the clover there?

162
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:13,226
The designer who made ties for Hiddink came up with that tie.

163
00:15:13,226 --> 00:15:15,226
It's a lucky tie.

164
00:15:16,096 --> 00:15:17,796
You never listen, do you?

165
00:15:19,397 --> 00:15:21,397
Just make sure you put that on.

166
00:15:21,397 --> 00:15:22,737
I got it.

167
00:15:35,346 --> 00:15:39,346
(Lee Tae Ju)

168
00:15:50,196 --> 00:15:51,767
When you graduate, you should go study abroad.

169
00:15:51,767 --> 00:15:54,066
You said that all those famous chefs went abroad to study.

170
00:15:54,466 --> 00:15:55,696
Forget it.

171
00:15:56,367 --> 00:15:58,936
I don't have to because I'm already that good.

172
00:16:00,936 --> 00:16:02,706
Starting now, I'm the breadwinner.

173
00:16:03,277 --> 00:16:04,946
I will get you back to school, send you abroad,

174
00:16:04,946 --> 00:16:06,946
and marry you off. I'll take care of everything.

175
00:16:06,946 --> 00:16:08,046
Are you kidding me?

176
00:16:08,517 --> 00:16:10,446
Who are you to tell me what to do with my life?

177
00:16:10,446 --> 00:16:12,816
You should quit your job right now.

178
00:16:12,816 --> 00:16:14,117
Once I attend the Judicial Research and Training Institute,

179
00:16:14,117 --> 00:16:15,387
I'll get a regular paycheck.

180
00:16:15,387 --> 00:16:18,086
So you just need to focus on going back to school, okay?

181
00:16:18,086 --> 00:16:20,127
Once I go back to school,

182
00:16:20,257 --> 00:16:21,627
I'm going to start dating first.

183
00:16:21,857 --> 00:16:23,357
Like a player.

184
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:26,627
You might end up becoming an uncle next year.

185
00:16:26,627 --> 00:16:27,936
Will that be okay for you?

186
00:16:28,367 --> 00:16:30,267
What's that on your hair? Come here.

187
00:16:30,267 --> 00:16:31,336
What is it?

188
00:16:36,107 --> 00:16:37,237
I've been too nice to you lately.

189
00:16:37,237 --> 00:16:38,607
Come on, use your words.

190
00:16:38,607 --> 00:16:39,607
Come here.

191
00:16:39,806 --> 00:16:41,176
- No, wait. - I've been too nice.

192
00:16:41,176 --> 00:16:42,176
Mr. Lawyer.

193
00:16:42,176 --> 00:16:43,316
You won't listen when I talk nicely to you.

194
00:16:43,316 --> 00:16:44,716
You come here.

195
00:16:44,716 --> 00:16:45,946
- Come here. - Mr. Lawyer.

196
00:16:46,487 --> 00:16:48,917
Come here. Should I go to you? Or will you come to me?

197
00:16:50,086 --> 00:16:52,086
- Did you just kick at me? - I have a knife too!

198
00:16:52,086 --> 00:16:53,387
- You squirrel. - Bring it on.

199
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,426
You'll be sorry. I'm serious.

200
00:16:57,397 --> 00:16:58,966
- Hold on. - My gosh.

201
00:16:59,426 --> 00:17:01,337
Wait!

202
00:17:04,807 --> 00:17:07,736
Are you curious about how your little brother died?

203
00:17:19,387 --> 00:17:20,716
The chairman is doing well, right?

204
00:17:22,456 --> 00:17:23,657
What chairman?

205
00:17:25,887 --> 00:17:26,887
Darn you.

206
00:17:29,526 --> 00:17:31,496
This is getting interesting.

207
00:17:32,627 --> 00:17:33,766
Lee Tae Kyung...

208
00:17:34,696 --> 00:17:36,236
found out about Jang Young Mi.

209
00:17:40,766 --> 00:17:42,077
Don't make mistakes.

210
00:17:42,907 --> 00:17:43,907
Mistakes?

211
00:17:48,077 --> 00:17:49,317
That reminds me.

212
00:17:50,676 --> 00:17:52,216
I think you might have to...

213
00:17:53,117 --> 00:17:55,286
give me a bit more than what was promised.

214
00:17:57,456 --> 00:17:59,186
I shouldn't make mistakes.

215
00:18:00,057 --> 00:18:01,057
You know?

216
00:18:06,297 --> 00:18:08,297
Mr. Guk, this jerk, Yang Chul Ki...

217
00:18:08,297 --> 00:18:10,597
Prosecutor Seo, we have a problem.

218
00:18:15,607 --> 00:18:18,506
Please explain why the prosecutor in charge has changed.

219
00:18:19,107 --> 00:18:20,746
It's my way of telling you to focus on the investigation.

220
00:18:20,746 --> 00:18:23,246
You can let another prosecutor take care of the trial.

221
00:18:23,246 --> 00:18:26,417
It's only an assault case of a thug. I don't need that much support.

222
00:18:26,587 --> 00:18:27,587
I don't understand...

223
00:18:27,587 --> 00:18:28,986
why you had to change the prosecutor in charge.

224
00:18:30,256 --> 00:18:31,256
You.

225
00:18:31,786 --> 00:18:33,627
You have an ulterior agenda behind this case.

226
00:18:35,456 --> 00:18:37,966
You interrogated Yang Chul Ki about a murder case.

227
00:18:41,236 --> 00:18:43,436
It was a simple interrogation regarding the assault case.

228
00:18:43,436 --> 00:18:45,567
I was just checking his previous convictions.

229
00:18:46,407 --> 00:18:48,676
Why did you want this case even if you had to take it...

230
00:18:48,676 --> 00:18:50,506
from the previous prosecutor in charge?

231
00:18:51,377 --> 00:18:52,377
Because of this,

232
00:18:53,047 --> 00:18:54,647
it is my judgment and decision as your supervisor...

233
00:18:54,647 --> 00:18:56,647
that you've lost your impartiality.

234
00:18:56,647 --> 00:18:58,647
The trial is right around the corner. How can...

235
00:18:58,647 --> 00:19:00,847
the new prosecutor take over the trial with just a few papers?

236
00:19:00,847 --> 00:19:01,917
This is outside pressure.

237
00:19:01,917 --> 00:19:02,917
Seo Yeon Ah.

238
00:19:03,417 --> 00:19:04,657
Is our organization a joke to you?

239
00:19:09,297 --> 00:19:10,297
No.

240
00:19:11,167 --> 00:19:13,526
I'm doing this because I want to prevent that from happening.

241
00:19:15,966 --> 00:19:17,706
I will not let someone else take over my trial.

242
00:19:17,706 --> 00:19:19,036
If that happens,

243
00:19:20,936 --> 00:19:22,676
I'll jump in with a bomb.

244
00:19:37,827 --> 00:19:38,827
Bomb?

245
00:19:40,226 --> 00:19:43,657
Goodness. She's making a royal mess here.

246
00:19:43,956 --> 00:19:45,127
What is it?

247
00:19:46,097 --> 00:19:47,266
Why is...

248
00:19:47,736 --> 00:19:50,196
the organization trying so hard to cover up...

249
00:19:50,196 --> 00:19:51,567
You think you're all grown up.

250
00:19:54,637 --> 00:19:57,506
Since when did you ask me why?

251
00:19:59,307 --> 00:20:00,946
Just follow my orders.

252
00:20:00,946 --> 00:20:03,246
Why is it so hard for you to follow my orders?

253
00:20:03,547 --> 00:20:05,016
Is it because you didn't go to college in Seoul?

254
00:20:06,746 --> 00:20:09,186
This is exactly why I didn't work with prosecutors...

255
00:20:09,186 --> 00:20:12,127
who didn't go to colleges in Seoul.

256
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:14,226
If you do this, I have nothing to say to my junior...

257
00:20:14,226 --> 00:20:16,597
Will they promote you to the Assistant Prosecutor General?

258
00:20:16,926 --> 00:20:20,266
If you have no connections, you must do everything to get some.

259
00:20:20,466 --> 00:20:22,867
Why are you so dense?

260
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:30,236
Make sure you deal with Prosecutor Seo.

261
00:20:30,637 --> 00:20:33,476
You'll be reappointed after this case is over.

262
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:36,577
Let's not lose something big over something petty.

263
00:20:39,047 --> 00:20:40,087
Okay?

264
00:20:50,097 --> 00:20:51,597
Woo Yong, should I just...

265
00:20:51,597 --> 00:20:53,466
let Yang Chul Ki get released and kill him?

266
00:20:53,466 --> 00:20:55,936
The more I dig it up, the weirder it is.

267
00:20:56,167 --> 00:20:57,337
Seven years ago,

268
00:20:57,907 --> 00:20:59,807
he was definitely involved with Tae Ju too.

269
00:21:00,266 --> 00:21:02,377
Don't you think he's the guy who killed my brother?

270
00:21:02,877 --> 00:21:05,746
Let's get him out of there and find out what happened.

271
00:21:06,176 --> 00:21:09,216
No, I don't think we should let this guy go.

272
00:21:09,417 --> 00:21:10,946
Prosecutor Seo has been replaced.

273
00:21:11,647 --> 00:21:12,917
Yang Chul Ki is...

274
00:21:13,817 --> 00:21:15,117
definitely not alone.

275
00:21:15,417 --> 00:21:17,087
If it doesn't feel right, don't let him out.

276
00:21:17,387 --> 00:21:18,956
A guy like him is nothing.

277
00:21:20,127 --> 00:21:21,397
I'll manage.

278
00:21:31,407 --> 00:21:34,877
Therefore, this was a case of mild violence...

279
00:21:34,877 --> 00:21:37,036
in the process of a fight for a privilege...

280
00:21:38,446 --> 00:21:40,547
which broke out in the midst of a reconstruction process.

281
00:21:42,847 --> 00:21:45,417
There was only mild violence involved.

282
00:21:45,417 --> 00:21:46,986
However, Yang Chul Ki, the defendant,

283
00:21:46,986 --> 00:21:51,387
already had seven previous charges of violence.

284
00:21:51,387 --> 00:21:56,357
Well, despite that, he used violence once again,

285
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:58,196
so the nature of his crime is...

286
00:21:59,696 --> 00:22:01,127
very serious.

287
00:22:01,127 --> 00:22:02,837
However, this case is an accidental homicide...

288
00:22:02,837 --> 00:22:05,607
that broke out as he was working on duty...

289
00:22:05,607 --> 00:22:09,676
as a team leader of laborers.

290
00:22:09,676 --> 00:22:11,246
Therefore, the prosecution demands...

291
00:22:12,476 --> 00:22:15,317
10 months of imprisonment...

292
00:22:15,317 --> 00:22:17,986
and 2 years in probation to Yang Chul Ki,

293
00:22:17,986 --> 00:22:20,887
according to Article 286 of the Criminal Code,

294
00:22:20,887 --> 00:22:22,956
negligence in the conduct of business.

295
00:22:26,087 --> 00:22:27,286
He is a murder suspect.

296
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:32,297
I'm the prosecutor who investigated this case.

297
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:35,536
I would like to explain the parts that were left out.

298
00:22:35,966 --> 00:22:37,236
I request the right to speak.

299
00:22:40,736 --> 00:22:44,176
I will dismiss the request as it was not previously agreed on.

300
00:22:55,186 --> 00:22:57,756
Defense? Make your final statement.

301
00:23:07,996 --> 00:23:09,637
The defendant, Yang Chul Ki,

302
00:23:10,696 --> 00:23:13,067
is a key suspect of a murder case.

303
00:23:21,107 --> 00:23:27,887
(Court)

304
00:23:36,397 --> 00:23:37,696
The defendant, Yang Chul Ki,

305
00:23:39,067 --> 00:23:41,337
is a key suspect of a murder case.

306
00:23:42,167 --> 00:23:43,637
To be more exact,

307
00:23:44,036 --> 00:23:46,907
he is under suspicion of the prosecution as a culprit...

308
00:23:47,236 --> 00:23:49,107
of an unresolved murder case from seven years ago.

309
00:23:49,307 --> 00:23:53,276
However, we aren't holding this trial for that unresolved case.

310
00:23:53,276 --> 00:23:55,417
We're here to deal with an assault case...

311
00:23:55,417 --> 00:23:57,516
which broke out on May 30, 2019, at a construction site...

312
00:23:57,516 --> 00:23:59,286
in Nonhyeon-dong.

313
00:23:59,516 --> 00:24:02,887
If the prosecution believes the defendant is...

314
00:24:02,887 --> 00:24:05,756
a suspect of that murder, they should bring in evidence...

315
00:24:05,786 --> 00:24:07,726
to indict him again for the murder,

316
00:24:07,726 --> 00:24:10,256
and judge him after going through the proper procedures.

317
00:24:10,857 --> 00:24:13,867
Of course, he deserves to be criticized...

318
00:24:13,996 --> 00:24:17,397
for using violence again when he has previous charges.

319
00:24:17,397 --> 00:24:19,337
But he deeply regrets what he has done,

320
00:24:19,337 --> 00:24:21,167
he settled the case with the victim,

321
00:24:21,167 --> 00:24:23,337
and the victim does not want him to be punished.

322
00:24:23,337 --> 00:24:26,676
Above all, please take into consideration...

323
00:24:27,776 --> 00:24:31,077
that he ended up using violence to protect the livelihood...

324
00:24:31,647 --> 00:24:34,087
of other laborers on the site. That's all.

325
00:24:47,196 --> 00:24:49,067
Do you know what you have done?

326
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:50,667
He's a murderer.

327
00:24:50,837 --> 00:24:52,036
This was an assault case.

328
00:24:52,036 --> 00:24:53,907
He's a key suspect of a murder.

329
00:24:53,907 --> 00:24:55,877
We don't know who else could die if he gets released.

330
00:24:55,877 --> 00:24:58,607
This isn't the end. Several people have died.

331
00:24:59,047 --> 00:25:02,117
Then find the evidence and indict him for murder.

332
00:25:02,476 --> 00:25:03,976
You couldn't even prove a simple assault.

333
00:25:03,976 --> 00:25:05,946
Stop whining and claiming he's a murderer without evidence.

334
00:25:08,286 --> 00:25:09,617
Why have you changed so much?

335
00:25:09,686 --> 00:25:11,256
Everyone changes.

336
00:25:11,526 --> 00:25:13,256
You have wrinkles next to your eyes.

337
00:25:13,686 --> 00:25:15,397
You should go get some facials.

338
00:25:15,397 --> 00:25:18,026
Is your paycheck not much? But your father is rich.

339
00:25:18,466 --> 00:25:20,526
You still have your darned way with words.

340
00:25:22,236 --> 00:25:24,137
You know, the tongue is a muscle. You can develop it by working out.

341
00:25:24,137 --> 00:25:26,506
The court isn't a cheap soap opera.

342
00:25:27,266 --> 00:25:29,436
Cheap soap operas get the best ratings.

343
00:25:35,946 --> 00:25:37,877
I hope you won't get any uglier than this.

344
00:25:38,917 --> 00:25:40,016
I mean it.

345
00:25:47,827 --> 00:25:51,867
(Court)

346
00:25:52,526 --> 00:25:58,536
(Seoul Detention Center)

347
00:25:58,966 --> 00:26:00,337
Hey, thug.

348
00:26:01,407 --> 00:26:02,577
Are you here for me?

349
00:26:02,577 --> 00:26:05,107
(True correction, bright future)

350
00:26:07,176 --> 00:26:08,577
You need to keep your promise.

351
00:26:08,577 --> 00:26:09,776
Of course.

352
00:26:10,377 --> 00:26:11,847
But I can't do it today.

353
00:26:13,516 --> 00:26:15,516
Do you seriously want to die?

354
00:26:15,716 --> 00:26:17,557
Come on, you're scaring me.

355
00:26:18,956 --> 00:26:20,926
My wife is pregnant,

356
00:26:21,827 --> 00:26:23,226
and she's getting birth pains.

357
00:26:25,266 --> 00:26:27,097
Goodness, you lack originality.

358
00:26:27,726 --> 00:26:29,736
Goodness, you're so inhumane.

359
00:26:29,766 --> 00:26:32,466
Hey, I may be a scumbag,

360
00:26:33,206 --> 00:26:35,307
but I wouldn't lie about my kid.

361
00:26:35,307 --> 00:26:37,476
You would. You're a thug.

362
00:26:39,077 --> 00:26:41,617
But let me ask you one question.

363
00:26:42,617 --> 00:26:44,377
Who's behind you?

364
00:26:45,216 --> 00:26:47,847
You killed the detective and changed the prosecutor.

365
00:26:48,486 --> 00:26:49,887
You didn't do that alone.

366
00:26:50,157 --> 00:26:52,486
Goodness, I didn't kill anyone.

367
00:26:53,426 --> 00:26:55,157
You're saying scary things, sir.

368
00:26:57,327 --> 00:27:00,127
What I have to give to you is at home anyway.

369
00:27:03,236 --> 00:27:04,297
That thing is...

370
00:27:05,466 --> 00:27:07,907
an important piece of evidence for your brother's death.

371
00:27:20,117 --> 00:27:21,557
Let's meet again tomorrow.

372
00:27:24,087 --> 00:27:25,127
Tomorrow?

373
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:28,087
Okay, let's go.

374
00:27:43,736 --> 00:27:47,006
You ended up making Lee Tae Kyung get Yang Chul Ki out of there.

375
00:27:50,047 --> 00:27:52,716
The most foolish desire of a human soul is...

376
00:27:53,946 --> 00:27:56,087
the desire to find the truth.

377
00:27:57,756 --> 00:27:59,026
Lee Tae Kyung is too dangerous.

378
00:28:03,657 --> 00:28:05,867
Do you know why I like Tae Kyung?

379
00:28:09,466 --> 00:28:12,936
He still has something called a soul.

380
00:28:14,466 --> 00:28:16,236
I am going to turn his life...

381
00:28:17,307 --> 00:28:19,607
even fancier than what it is now.

382
00:28:21,847 --> 00:28:27,917
(Noodles, dumplings, rice cake soup, chopped noodles)

383
00:28:44,466 --> 00:28:46,607
Woo Yong, I think Yang Chul Ki ran away.

384
00:28:47,436 --> 00:28:50,337
I'll look for him. Don't worry about it.

385
00:28:59,246 --> 00:29:00,647
I told you to wait.

386
00:29:04,986 --> 00:29:06,786
The prosecution kept on going behind my back,

387
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:08,657
and Lee Tae Kyung was such a nuisance.

388
00:29:10,397 --> 00:29:11,867
I was about to go insane from fear.

389
00:29:14,696 --> 00:29:17,097
It'll be over once you leave to the Philippines in two days.

390
00:29:20,667 --> 00:29:24,206
If you didn't use his brother as bait,

391
00:29:24,607 --> 00:29:27,107
he would have gone all the way without releasing me.

392
00:29:28,617 --> 00:29:29,617
Right?

393
00:29:31,817 --> 00:29:33,587
No one is smarter than you, Chairman Song.

394
00:29:33,946 --> 00:29:35,286
Is there something else you want?

395
00:29:38,216 --> 00:29:39,226
Yes.

396
00:29:41,057 --> 00:29:42,557
I don't want to go to the Philippines.

397
00:29:43,097 --> 00:29:46,226
Either Australia or somewhere more developed.

398
00:29:48,266 --> 00:29:49,667
It's good for my child's education.

399
00:29:50,837 --> 00:29:53,036
The good nature of a person...

400
00:29:53,466 --> 00:29:57,137
comes out when they are faced with fear.

401
00:30:11,117 --> 00:30:12,887
- Dad! - Hey.

402
00:30:13,357 --> 00:30:15,696
Is this your friend's house?

403
00:30:16,026 --> 00:30:17,397
The house is awesome.

404
00:30:17,597 --> 00:30:20,026
I had a lot of great food too.

405
00:30:21,266 --> 00:30:22,496
What's your name?

406
00:30:22,797 --> 00:30:24,397
I'm Yang Seung Il.

407
00:30:25,137 --> 00:30:26,137
Yang...

408
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:27,867
Seung...

409
00:30:28,706 --> 00:30:29,706
Il.

410
00:30:36,276 --> 00:30:37,276
Come here.

411
00:30:42,657 --> 00:30:43,956
You can get something delicious.

412
00:30:44,357 --> 00:30:46,026
Thank you.

413
00:30:46,026 --> 00:30:47,526
Good boy.

414
00:30:48,897 --> 00:30:50,496
Good for you.

415
00:30:51,496 --> 00:30:52,726
Your dad's...

416
00:30:56,067 --> 00:30:57,696
tough days are over.

417
00:33:18,577 --> 00:33:21,446
Darn it, why is it suddenly pouring?

418
00:33:23,117 --> 00:33:24,117
You're here.

419
00:33:24,476 --> 00:33:27,716
Woo Yong, I can't get a hold of that jerk, Yang Chul Ki.

420
00:33:30,956 --> 00:33:32,286
Where do you think he is?

421
00:33:52,347 --> 00:33:54,147
(Special thanks to Lee Dae Yeon for his cameo performance.)

422
00:34:11,996 --> 00:34:14,897
(Justice)

423
00:34:14,897 --> 00:34:15,936
You can do it with me.

424
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:17,797
That cooperative investigation or something.

425
00:34:17,797 --> 00:34:19,837
A million dollars. Bring me whatever you have.

426
00:34:19,837 --> 00:34:21,766
The better the information is, the more I'll bet.

427
00:34:21,766 --> 00:34:24,507
This is why people should prepare for their future.

428
00:34:24,507 --> 00:34:26,806
I thought it could come in handy, so I kept this around.

429
00:34:26,806 --> 00:34:27,846
What do you want?

430
00:34:27,846 --> 00:34:29,746
What was it? That delivery man died.

431
00:34:29,746 --> 00:34:31,076
I just took it and handed it over.

432
00:34:31,076 --> 00:34:32,516
- That USB. - USB?

433
00:34:32,516 --> 00:34:34,147
Jang In Tae. A trainee.

434
00:34:34,147 --> 00:34:36,156
A person died as soon as Yang Chul Ki got out.

435
00:34:36,156 --> 00:34:38,357
Someone in the same agency as the girl who died seven years ago,

436
00:34:38,357 --> 00:34:39,927
and the crime method is similar too.

437
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:42,751
Yes, but I'm not the real culprit who killed your brother.

438
00:34:43,156 --> 00:34:45,366
The real culprit is someone else!
