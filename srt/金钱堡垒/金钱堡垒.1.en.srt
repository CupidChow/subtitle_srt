or the number of steps?

00:24:31,916 --> 00:24:34,166
I try to ignore my phone
most of the time these days.

348
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:35,500
You piss someone off?

349
00:24:36,083 --> 00:24:37,750
I’m a cop, what do you think?

350
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:43,055
- Just pour me another one, Sasha.
- [Sasha] Fine. Give me a second.

351
00:24:44,708 --> 00:24:46,208
- Double?
- [Vinny] Yeah, please.

352
00:24:47,208 --> 00:24:49,833
- You want one, Walid?
- No, thanks. I’m calling it a night.

353
00:24:50,583 --> 00:24:53,333
I haven’t seen Richard in a
while. Is he coming tonight?

354
00:24:53,416 --> 00:24:54,541
No, not tonight.

355
00:24:54,625 --> 00:24:57,625
- [woman] Can I get two mojitos, please?
- [Sasha] Yeah. Coming right up.

356
00:24:58,250 --> 00:24:59,333
I’ll take your card.

357
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:00,291
There you go.

358
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:01,208
Sasha?

359
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:03,541
- Hit me.
- [woman] Can I get a rum and coke?

360
00:25:03,625 --> 00:25:05,250
Shit, you really drank that one.

361
00:25:06,291 --> 00:25:07,500
Last one, okay.

362
00:25:07,583 --> 00:25:10,625
- Vinny, we got work tomorrow.
- I don’t give a shit, Walid.

363
00:25:10,708 --> 00:25:12,250
- [woman] A vodka tonic.
- Vinny…

364
00:25:12,958 --> 00:25:15,351
- We’ve always survived, haven’t we?
- Don’t bullshit me, man.

365
00:25:15,375 --> 00:25:17,041
Hey… It’s gonna be fine.

366
00:25:17,625 --> 00:25:18,625
Trust me, okay?

367
00:25:19,166 --> 00:25:21,458
Come on, I’ll give you a
ride home. You’ve had enough.

368
00:25:21,541 --> 00:25:22,901
I don’t wanna
leave! You go ahead.

369
00:25:22,958 --> 00:25:26,041
And you can keep sucking Sami’s
dick if you want, but I’m out.

370
00:25:26,666 --> 00:25:28,666
Just fucking go
home, man. Get lost!

371
00:25:30,041 --> 00:25:32,375
[Sasha] Get your card ready.
I’ll just be a second.

372
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,000
- [woman] Can I get some ice, please?
- [Sasha] Sure!

["Ich komme zurück" continues]

374
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:44,083
What was that, Vinny?
What’s the matter with you?

375
00:25:45,125 --> 00:25:46,125
Talk to me.

376
00:25:47,583 --> 00:25:49,291
[Vinny] It’s nothing. Hit me.

377
00:25:49,375 --> 00:25:50,791
No, I’m cuttin' you off.

378
00:26:14,583 --> 00:26:16,208
["Ich komme zurück" continues]

379
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:26,875

Sorry to call you so
late, man. [inhales]

388

not hear on the news.</i>

398
00:28:01,166 --> 00:28:02,208
How'd it happen?

00:28:03,916 --> 00:28:06,875

[Titus] Your old

Yeah, Vinny and I
worked together.

420

You were pretty close?

421
00:29:48,083 --> 00:29:49,375
We were all close.

Hmm.

Murdering a cop like that.

425
00:29:56,958 --> 00:29:58,333
Cold-blooded shit, man.

426
00:30:00,375 --> 00:30:03,166
Do you think it was work-related?
Some kind of payback?

427
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:05,458
- Revenge?
- [Antoine] I have no idea.

There’s a woman asking for you.

She says it’s really urgent.

Do I know her?

432
00:30:13,791 --> 00:30:14,791
She says you do.

433
00:30:14,833 --> 00:30:16,583
Says her last name is Esteves.

[eerie music continues]

440
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:43,833
Disappeared from where?

441
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,291
I took him to get checked in to
the Barbanes Clinic last month.

442
00:30:49,375 --> 00:30:52,208
I got a call from the woman
in charge eight days ago.

443
00:30:52,291 --> 00:30:54,958
She said they looked everywhere,
but Richard was gone.

444
00:30:56,666 --> 00:30:59,416
After what happened to Vinny, I’m
really scared something’s wrong.

445
00:31:00,333 --> 00:31:01,750
Why was he at the Barbanes?

things to himself.

452
00:31:20,083 --> 00:31:23,000
Vinny started going out all
the time after his divorce and…

453
00:31:23,833 --> 00:31:25,291
Richard got lost in all that.

454
00:31:26,333 --> 00:31:29,166
I haven’t heard from him
at all in over a week now.

[birds chirping]

456
00:31:31,166 --> 00:31:33,666
- Did you file a missing person's?
- Soon as I could.

457
00:31:34,625 --> 00:31:36,583
I went to the station
with his picture.

458
00:31:37,416 --> 00:31:39,216
They basically said
they’d put it in his file.

459
00:31:42,458 --> 00:31:44,625
There’s something not
right going on here.

460
00:31:44,708 --> 00:31:45,875
It doesn’t make sense.

461
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:50,000
Three officers from the Crime Squad
came to my house this morning.

462
00:31:51,041 --> 00:31:53,375
They were asking all sorts
of things about Richard.

463
00:31:53,458 --> 00:31:56,875
They searched every inch of my house. I
don’t know what they were looking for,

464
00:31:56,958 --> 00:31:59,291
but they found nothing and
they left with no explanation.

465
00:32:00,125 --> 00:32:01,416
Did they give you their names?

466
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,041
[inhales]

467
00:32:03,541 --> 00:32:04,541

her if I heard from him or he came home.

00:32:16,666 --> 00:32:18,083
What did Sami say?

473
00:32:18,166 --> 00:32:19,333
Have you talked to him?

474
00:32:20,291 --> 00:32:22,000
All of my calls go
straight to voicemail.

475
00:32:22,916 --> 00:32:23,916
Okay.

476
00:32:24,666 --> 00:32:26,500
I’m gonna make a
few calls. Okay?

477
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,375

You called the Crime unit?

Yes, but they had some trouble with
their rides. They’re running a bit late.

Evening, Doctor.

507
00:35:17,458 --> 00:35:20,916
Richard Esteves was my patient. And
unfortunately, that means I won't be

508

able to divulge any medical information
as it’s highly confidential.

- I swore an oath to protect my patients.
- Of course.

But since your patient managed to escape
the department that you currently oversee,

I think a little flexibility
is in order. Huh?

police searched his room already?

wasn’t the local police.

find anything?

00:35:51,291 --> 00:35:54,416
but a change of clothes and a
few toiletries. This is his room.

521
00:36:11,208 --> 00:36:13,666
Did he spend time with
anyone else? Besides you?

522
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:14,916
Not much, no.

523
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
The only person I saw him
speak to once in a while

524
00:36:18,083 --> 00:36:20,791
was the gentleman with the room
next to his, Victor Garnier.

525
00:36:20,875 --> 00:36:22,235
Is he around? I’d
like to see him.

526
00:36:22,291 --> 00:36:25,833
Mr. Garnier always sits on the bench
near the river around this time.

527
00:36:25,916 --> 00:36:26,916
And why is he here?

528
00:36:26,958 --> 00:36:29,458
He lost his wife and
daughter in a car accident.

529
00:36:29,958 --> 00:36:31,208
He was driving them home.

530
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:33,375
[birds chirping]

531
00:36:34,666 --> 00:36:36,750
[tense music playing]

532
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:48,500
[Antoine] Victor Garnier?

533
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:52,291
Who the hell are you?

534
00:36:54,833 --> 00:36:56,375
A friend of Richard Esteves.

535
00:36:56,458 --> 00:36:57,541
Can we talk?

536
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:01,500
I got nothing else besides
what I told the Crime idiots.

537
00:37:03,625 --> 00:37:05,166
You got a name or what?

538
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:06,416
Antoine Cerda.

539
00:37:06,916 --> 00:37:08,500
Anti-Crime at the 93.

540
00:37:08,583 --> 00:37:10,583
But I worked with
Richard before that.

541
00:37:10,666 --> 00:37:12,666
Right, you got
transferred. I know that.

542
00:37:13,166 --> 00:37:14,416
He told me what happened.

543
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,125
[tense music continues]

544
00:37:16,208 --> 00:37:17,375
What do you wanna know?

545
00:37:18,791 --> 00:37:20,250
What else he might’ve said.

546
00:37:20,916 --> 00:37:23,291
Apparently, you’re the
only person he talked to.

547
00:37:24,083 --> 00:37:25,166
Wouldn't say talked.

548
00:37:26,208 --> 00:37:27,208
Richard…

549
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
He was lost.

550
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:33,000
He babbled all sorts
of crazy shit to me.

551
00:37:33,625 --> 00:37:35,166
I just sat there and listened.

552
00:37:36,125 --> 00:37:37,125
What kind of shit?

553
00:37:40,125 --> 00:37:41,125
Paranoid shit.

554
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
[sighs]

555
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:46,541
He had this thing about how
he’d accidentally pissed off

556
00:37:46,625 --> 00:37:47,708
a powerful drug lord.

557
00:37:48,708 --> 00:37:51,666
That the guy was part of
some international crime ring

558
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:54,541
that was coming after
him and his whole family.

559
00:37:56,666 --> 00:37:59,666
That the buffoons in charge had
thrown his entire unit to the wolves

560
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:01,851
after he and his team botched
an off-the-books mission

561
00:38:01,875 --> 00:38:04,833
that was supposed to stay under
wraps for the usual reasons.

562
00:38:05,875 --> 00:38:07,583
All sorts of paranoid bullshit.

563
00:38:08,958 --> 00:38:11,541
This place was just a
high-security hideout for him.

564
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:15,750
I’m curious about the mission.
Did he tell you anything else?

565
00:38:16,416 --> 00:38:17,416
No.

566
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:22,125
He just said they’d all made a big mistake
and that it was gonna cost them dearly.

567
00:38:22,625 --> 00:38:23,958
Who are “they"?

568
00:38:24,041 --> 00:38:25,666
Oh. That's anybody’s guess.

569
00:38:26,708 --> 00:38:27,833
I’m not a psychic.

570
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
You can ask him when
you track him down.

571
00:38:31,083 --> 00:38:32,541
[tense music continues]

572
00:38:33,708 --> 00:38:35,083
But I wouldn’t count on it.

573
00:38:36,166 --> 00:38:37,166
You ask me,

574
00:38:37,208 --> 00:38:40,125
he’s tying a noose around his
neck, or maybe shoving the barrel

575
00:38:40,208 --> 00:38:42,625
of his gun down his throat,
ready to pull the trigger.

576
00:38:43,875 --> 00:38:45,583
That’s what they
all end up doing.

577
00:38:48,875 --> 00:38:51,875
The drug dealer with the
international crime ring…

578
00:38:52,375 --> 00:38:53,625
Did he say who it was?

579
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,500
No, all he said was that
it was a powerful network.

580
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,208
And that if it ever got out, it’d
blow everyone out of the water.

581
00:39:04,125 --> 00:39:06,208
Any idea where he might’ve gone?

582
00:39:06,291 --> 00:39:07,291
An address or…

583
00:39:07,833 --> 00:39:09,458
anything that could help me?

584
00:39:09,541 --> 00:39:10,625
Help you what?

585
00:39:10,708 --> 00:39:12,500
[tense music continues]

586
00:39:12,583 --> 00:39:14,416
I told you your
friend was crazy.

587
00:39:16,125 --> 00:39:18,291
Nothing like the old
Richard I used to know.

588
00:39:19,125 --> 00:39:20,125
What do you mean?

589
00:39:21,708 --> 00:39:25,750
I was his team leader 15 years ago
when he started at Judicial Police HQ.

590
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:29,166
We spent five years
busting our asses together

591
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:30,791
before he moved to Anti-Gang.

592
00:39:34,375 --> 00:39:35,916
Would you have a cigarette?

593
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,000
I don’t smoke, sorry.

594
00:39:39,791 --> 00:39:41,458
The new generation of cops.

595
00:39:42,333 --> 00:39:44,208
You don’t drink,
you don’t smoke.

596
00:39:44,291 --> 00:39:45,125
Pff.

597
00:39:45,208 --> 00:39:46,041
[music fades]

598
00:39:46,125 --> 00:39:47,291
You get laid I hope?

599
00:39:47,375 --> 00:39:48,375
[chuckles]

600
00:39:54,416 --> 00:39:55,916
He really respected you.

601
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,625
It pissed him off what they did.

602
00:39:58,708 --> 00:40:00,458
He really thought
they screwed you.

603
00:40:02,875 --> 00:40:03,958
You want some advice?

604
00:40:06,166 --> 00:40:07,958
Wherever he is, leave him be.

605
00:40:08,666 --> 00:40:10,166
And why do you say that?

606
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:11,250
Because…

607
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:15,291
If any part of what he said is
true, you’ll either end up here

608
00:40:15,375 --> 00:40:18,083
or six feet under and there
won’t be anyone to turn to.

609
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,625
You wanna help? [grunts]

610
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:30,250
[sniffs]

611
00:40:30,583 --> 00:40:32,583
This will probably
get you in deep shit,

612
00:40:33,416 --> 00:40:35,750
but take this and
call the number on it.

613
00:40:36,458 --> 00:40:39,791
Richard left me that and said to
call if he got in serious trouble.

614
00:40:41,541 --> 00:40:44,666
I didn’t tell those assholes I had
that, so do what you want with it.

615
00:40:48,666 --> 00:40:50,708
I sure hope he wasn’t
wrong about you.

616
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:53,083
Me too.

617
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:55,750
Good luck.

618
00:41:04,416 --> 00:41:06,125
[gulls cawing]

619
00:41:12,666 --> 00:41:15,541
- What the hell, Antoine!
- [Antoine] I need to talk to you.

620
00:41:17,833 --> 00:41:19,208
What’s there to talk about?

621
00:41:20,666 --> 00:41:23,684
You’ve got some nerve, you know that?
I haven’t heard from you in six months.

622
00:41:23,708 --> 00:41:25,583
You didn’t even come
to the funerals.

623
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,916
You deserved better, I know.

624
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Especially you.

625
00:41:32,458 --> 00:41:34,541
I’m glad to hear it.
I agree with you.

626
00:41:36,833 --> 00:41:38,041
What’re you here for?

627
00:41:39,875 --> 00:41:41,083
I actually need a favor.

628
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:42,166
Hmm.

629
00:41:43,791 --> 00:41:46,166
[Antoine] Are you still friends
with that girl in records?

630
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:47,250
Yeah, why?

631
00:41:48,458 --> 00:41:51,333
Because I got a number from
a guy at the Barbanes Clinic.

632
00:41:51,416 --> 00:41:53,875
I’ve called a bunch of
times, but there’s no answer.

633
00:41:53,958 --> 00:41:56,333
- I just need to know whose it is.
- The Barbanes?

634
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,500
[Antoine] Yeah, Richard
had been there for a month.

635
00:42:00,291 --> 00:42:02,642
There was this one guy he talked
to and he gave him a number

636
00:42:02,666 --> 00:42:04,708
and said to call it if
something happened to him.

637
00:42:04,791 --> 00:42:06,291
That’s the number
I’ve been calling.

638
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:10,017
Hanna, I don’t know what you
guys got up to with the team,

639
00:42:10,041 --> 00:42:11,375
but it’s some really bad shit.

640
00:42:11,458 --> 00:42:13,098
I transferred to
Narcotics when you left.

641
00:42:13,125 --> 00:42:15,750
- Why don’t you go to Sami?
- He’s not returning my calls either.

642
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:16,833
Too bad.

643
00:42:18,625 --> 00:42:20,541
I’m not gonna drop it,
even if Balestra told me

644
00:42:20,625 --> 00:42:22,708
it was ancient history and
I should stay out of it.

645
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:25,708
The pieces don’t add
up. I don’t get it.

646
00:42:26,666 --> 00:42:29,166
But there’s a lot of people
digging into whatever this is.

647
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:30,250
Like who?

648
00:42:31,583 --> 00:42:33,263
Besides Wagner and her
squad, I’m not sure.

649
00:42:34,375 --> 00:42:35,875
You don’t think
they’re involved?

650
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:38,470
Are you saying they’re
the ones behind this?

651
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:42,250
That’s bullshit.

652
00:42:45,291 --> 00:42:46,791
Run this number for me please?

653
00:42:48,875 --> 00:42:51,375
Help me out and I won’t
bug you anymore, I promise.

654
00:42:55,916 --> 00:42:56,916
You’re a pain.

655
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Thanks.

656
00:43:16,541 --> 00:43:19,458
Did he ever mention any names
from cases he was working on?

657
00:43:19,541 --> 00:43:21,833
Did he tell you or talk
about it in front of you?

658
00:43:21,916 --> 00:43:23,916
You know Richard, he
didn’t bring his work home.

659
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,833
You don’t need to
protect him, okay?

660
00:43:26,583 --> 00:43:29,125
He went into hiding because
he’s caught up in something bad.

661
00:43:29,916 --> 00:43:31,125
What makes you think that?

662
00:43:31,708 --> 00:43:33,583
When the Crime Squad
showed up here,

663
00:43:34,083 --> 00:43:35,166
what were they after?

664
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:36,333
[tense music playing]

665
00:43:36,416 --> 00:43:37,416
I don’t know.

666
00:43:39,791 --> 00:43:41,791
Did you notice anything
different about him?

667
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:44,291
In his behavior or his routine?

668
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:47,833
Did you guys start having
more spending money maybe?

669
00:43:49,125 --> 00:43:50,791
Did he start bringing home cash?

670
00:43:51,291 --> 00:43:52,625
Did his spending take off?

671
00:43:53,666 --> 00:43:54,583
No.

672
00:43:54,666 --> 00:43:55,916
Except maybe on alcohol.

673
00:43:56,541 --> 00:43:58,416
And I found some
coke in his pockets.

674
00:44:00,333 --> 00:44:01,333
Okay.

675
00:44:03,291 --> 00:44:04,291
Well…

676
00:44:05,916 --> 00:44:09,083
if ever you think of something,
a name, an address, whatever,

677
00:44:09,166 --> 00:44:10,708
even if it seems like nothing,

678
00:44:11,208 --> 00:44:13,583
call me using this
cell phone. Okay?

679
00:44:15,041 --> 00:44:17,241
Don’t use your phone, ’cause
I’m sure they’re listening.

680
00:44:20,708 --> 00:44:21,916
[tense music continues]

681
00:44:23,125 --> 00:44:25,000
If there’s anything
I can do for you…

682
00:44:26,166 --> 00:44:27,333
just let me know. Hmm?

683
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:31,125
I will.

684
00:44:34,958 --> 00:44:36,875
Do you think he’s
still alive though?

685
00:44:39,833 --> 00:44:40,833
I don’t know, Sofia.

686
00:44:43,958 --> 00:44:44,958
I really don’t know.

687
00:44:46,375 --> 00:44:48,166
[music becomes somber]

688
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:06,791
Glad we caught you.

689
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:08,500
I’m with Crime.

690
00:45:09,833 --> 00:45:12,166
Mrs. Wagner would like
to talk to you a minute.

691
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:13,750
Sure.

692
00:45:21,958 --> 00:45:23,375
[sighs]

693
00:45:24,791 --> 00:45:25,791
Captain Cerda,

694
00:45:26,916 --> 00:45:29,416
I’ll be very frank. We’re
handling the situation.

695
00:45:31,416 --> 00:45:34,416
I’m well aware that you and
Richard Esteves were friends.

696
00:45:34,916 --> 00:45:36,916
That you worked
together for years.

697
00:45:38,291 --> 00:45:41,166
I understand that you wanna
help. And I respect it.

698
00:45:42,375 --> 00:45:45,500
But I need you to cease all
activities regarding his situation.

699
00:45:46,791 --> 00:45:49,250
And go back to focusing
on your actual job.

700
00:45:49,333 --> 00:45:52,625
Which is to maintain order and
ensure the safety of our citizens.

701
00:45:55,958 --> 00:45:57,333
Richard and I are close.

702
00:45:58,375 --> 00:46:00,541
Sofia’s worried and I’m
just trying to help.

703
00:46:02,958 --> 00:46:03,958
You’re helping?

704
00:46:04,875 --> 00:46:06,791
Your close friend with
whom you haven’t spoken

705
00:46:06,875 --> 00:46:08,708
since you left the
Anti-Gang unit, is that it?

706
00:46:08,791 --> 00:46:09,791
Close that way?

707
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:11,000
[soft piano playing]

708
00:46:11,666 --> 00:46:13,000
You need to step aside.

709
00:46:13,083 --> 00:46:15,833
We’ll handle any concerns
the wife has for your friend.

710
00:46:15,916 --> 00:46:19,083
You mind your own business and
there won’t be any repercussions.

711
00:46:20,375 --> 00:46:22,041
Think about your
future, Captain.

712
00:46:23,291 --> 00:46:26,875
It would be quite a waste for you to
squander your talent as a mall cop.

713
00:46:28,208 --> 00:46:29,291
So is that a threat?

714
00:46:30,833 --> 00:46:31,916
No.

715
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,208
When you don’t listen, you
don’t stay in the game.

716
00:46:37,291 --> 00:46:39,333
I enjoyed this little chat,
but I’ve got a meeting.

717
00:46:43,666 --> 00:46:45,083
[sighs]

718
00:46:46,375 --> 00:46:47,375
[door opens]

719
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:50,500
[door closes]

720
00:46:53,291 --> 00:46:55,291
[phone ringing]

721
00:46:57,250 --> 00:46:58,250
Hey.

722
00:46:58,291 --> 00:46:59,791
[Hanna] <i>I got what you wanted.</i>

723
00:47:01,125 --> 00:47:02,125
Great, go ahead.

724
00:47:02,458 --> 00:47:04,541
<i>Not on the phone. Meet
me at the Bastion.</i>

725
00:47:04,625 --> 00:47:05,625
[phone beeps]

726
00:47:06,958 --> 00:47:08,583
<i>The number belongs to an escort.</i>

727
00:47:08,666 --> 00:47:10,333
Kristina Dankeva.

728
00:47:10,416 --> 00:47:12,500
Her address is over near
the Bir-Hakeim bridge.

729
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,916
She has drug possession and
trafficking on her record.

730
00:47:17,416 --> 00:47:18,416
Did you know?

731
00:47:18,916 --> 00:47:19,916
Did I know what?

732
00:47:20,333 --> 00:47:22,000
Did you know he was
seeing this girl?

733
00:47:23,541 --> 00:47:24,791
No. Of course I didn’t.

734
00:47:27,208 --> 00:47:29,809
I transferred out when the rest of
the team started fucking around.

735
00:47:29,833 --> 00:47:31,541
- I wanted no part of it.
- Part of what?

736
00:47:33,833 --> 00:47:36,625
When you left, Sami had
a chip on his shoulder.

737
00:47:36,708 --> 00:47:38,166
He thought they screwed you.

738
00:47:38,666 --> 00:47:40,000
He became super aggressive

739
00:47:40,083 --> 00:47:42,041
and he dragged the others
into dangerous shit.

740
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:43,291
What shit?

741
00:47:44,041 --> 00:47:45,833
Does SIT sound familiar?

742
00:47:46,416 --> 00:47:48,541
Yeah, it’s the Special
Investigation Team.

743
00:47:49,041 --> 00:47:51,583
They shut it down two years ago.
What’s it got to do with Sami?

744
00:47:51,666 --> 00:47:53,875
They reinstated it right
after your transfer,

745
00:47:53,958 --> 00:47:56,875
and they made it clear to Sami
they expected him to run it.

746
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,791
“They” being the assholes
who fucked you over.

747
00:48:01,208 --> 00:48:03,458
And the rest of the team
went along too then?

748
00:48:04,041 --> 00:48:06,041
You know Sami’s
impossible to resist.

749
00:48:06,125 --> 00:48:07,625
Plus the hazard pay was huge.

750
00:48:07,708 --> 00:48:09,625
They didn’t need
much more convincing.

751
00:48:10,958 --> 00:48:11,791
You did.

752
00:48:11,875 --> 00:48:15,208
They never even talked to me about
it. I had already left the team.

753
00:48:18,958 --> 00:48:20,625
Who else knows
about the SI team?

754
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:23,375
Not too many people.
It stayed under wraps.

755
00:48:23,458 --> 00:48:24,666
But someone told you.

756
00:48:25,458 --> 00:48:27,666
I ran into Richard at
the Rex Club one night.

757
00:48:28,375 --> 00:48:30,625
He was completely wasted
and he let it slip.

758
00:48:31,291 --> 00:48:33,541
But all he said was that
they’d gotten sloppy on an op

759
00:48:33,625 --> 00:48:36,041
and it was gonna cost
them. I didn’t get details.

760
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,583
What’re you doing
with the escort?

761
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:44,708
Well, I figure I'd just drop in and
see if she can tell me anything.

762
00:48:45,208 --> 00:48:47,166
Honestly, I think
you should forget it.

763
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:51,166
Go see Wagner. She’s
heading the investigation.

764
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:52,833
She came to see me
and made it clear

765
00:48:52,916 --> 00:48:55,125
she would ruin my career
if I didn’t drop it.

766
00:49:00,291 --> 00:49:01,916
You’re a fucking trouble magnet.

767
00:49:02,625 --> 00:49:03,875
It’s in your DNA.

768
00:49:04,791 --> 00:49:05,791
[chuckles softly]

769
00:49:07,791 --> 00:49:08,791
This is all I have.

770
00:49:08,833 --> 00:49:10,833
[siren wailing in the distance]

771
00:49:12,666 --> 00:49:13,791
Thanks for doing this.

772
00:49:16,541 --> 00:49:17,625
Doing what?

773
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Everything.

774
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:21,958
Hmm.

775
00:49:26,083 --> 00:49:27,291
You’re pissed, huh?

776
00:49:29,291 --> 00:49:33,208
Six and a half months of nothing. Pretty
much any girl would be pissed off.

777
00:49:35,291 --> 00:49:36,291
I deserve better.

778
00:49:39,541 --> 00:49:41,125
[dramatic music playing]

779
00:49:41,208 --> 00:49:44,083
I couldn’t deal with being
sent back to square one really.

780
00:49:46,333 --> 00:49:47,416
We never doubted you.

781
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:48,666
There was no judgment.

782
00:49:49,166 --> 00:49:50,166
Yeah, well uh…

783
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,458
I disappointed you.

784
00:49:53,083 --> 00:49:54,083
Did I say that?

785
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:58,958
I made it clear to you that I
didn’t care where you worked.

786
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:03,208
It wouldn’t matter if you
spent your days at a desk.

787
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:15,750
Which you’d know if
you heard my messages.

788
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
I did.

789
00:50:18,416 --> 00:50:19,791
Multiple times and I…

790
00:50:20,916 --> 00:50:22,291
And you what? Erased them?

791
00:50:26,375 --> 00:50:27,375
Did you erase them?

792
00:50:30,416 --> 00:50:31,750
[chuckles softly]

793
00:50:36,625 --> 00:50:38,041
[dramatic music intensifies]

794
00:50:57,250 --> 00:50:58,291
[music fades]

795
00:50:58,375 --> 00:50:59,375
[birds chirping]

796
00:51:18,166 --> 00:51:19,208
I have to go.

797
00:51:33,083 --> 00:51:36,250
“I want others to know that I
found my way through the chaos."

798
00:51:36,875 --> 00:51:39,291
"And that through the
suffering, I was reborn.”

799
00:51:42,458 --> 00:51:43,458
Who’s that from?

800
00:51:45,208 --> 00:51:46,458
Dan Fante.

801
00:51:47,916 --> 00:51:48,916
Is it true?

802
00:51:49,916 --> 00:51:50,916
That’s why I got it.

803
00:51:52,875 --> 00:51:54,166
And you get some credit.

804
00:52:06,291 --> 00:52:07,291
Do you…

805
00:52:09,791 --> 00:52:11,041
still fight for Marcus?

806
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:17,500
Why do you do it?

807
00:52:23,291 --> 00:52:25,166
I learned to fight
because of my dad.

808
00:52:28,375 --> 00:52:30,125
He liked to beat
me and my brother.

809
00:52:32,083 --> 00:52:33,833
But my mom was his
favorite target.

810
00:52:36,416 --> 00:52:38,166
One night he was really bad.

811
00:52:40,125 --> 00:52:41,166
Drunker than ever…

812
00:52:43,958 --> 00:52:45,208
He started punching her…

813
00:52:45,916 --> 00:52:46,916
hard.

814
00:52:48,791 --> 00:52:50,416
I thought he was gonna kill her.

815
00:52:54,958 --> 00:52:57,166
I lost my mind and
knocked him out.

816
00:53:01,625 --> 00:53:03,375
After that, I never went back.

817
00:53:03,458 --> 00:53:04,500
I was only 17.

818
00:53:06,791 --> 00:53:08,458
He refused to ever see me again.

819
00:53:09,333 --> 00:53:11,125
Your mom stayed with him anyway?

820
00:53:11,875 --> 00:53:13,541
Of course, she had no one else.

821
00:53:15,166 --> 00:53:18,083
Because we lost my brother in
an accident six months later.

822
00:53:28,875 --> 00:53:30,833
How come you never
told me any of this?

823
00:53:32,541 --> 00:53:33,541
I don’t know.

824
00:53:35,416 --> 00:53:36,583
I needed some time.

825
00:53:45,291 --> 00:53:46,291
I love you.

826
00:53:51,166 --> 00:53:52,250
I really need to go.

827
00:54:13,916 --> 00:54:14,958
I’ll be right back.

828
00:54:25,041 --> 00:54:26,083
[doorbell rings]

829
00:54:26,166 --> 00:54:27,541
Kristina, it’s the police.

830
00:54:30,041 --> 00:54:32,041
[continues ringing doorbell]

831
00:54:37,291 --> 00:54:38,208
What do you want?

832
00:54:38,291 --> 00:54:40,125
I need to talk to
you about Richard.

833
00:54:41,708 --> 00:54:42,708
Can I come in?

834
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:45,083
I only let clients in here.

835
00:54:45,166 --> 00:54:46,166
It’s important.

836
00:54:47,583 --> 00:54:48,750
[door closes]

837
00:54:51,416 --> 00:54:53,375
When was the last
time you saw him?

838
00:54:53,458 --> 00:54:54,458
I don’t know.

839
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:56,916
I know that you
guys are in touch.

840
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,541
If you know where he is,
tell me. He’s in danger.

841
00:55:00,625 --> 00:55:01,625
And so are you.

842
00:55:03,250 --> 00:55:05,750
Hey, listen. I just
wanna help a friend.

843
00:55:07,041 --> 00:55:08,625
I need to find him
before others do.

844
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:11,875
I don’t know where he is.

845
00:55:11,958 --> 00:55:14,250
He came by last week and I
haven’t heard from him since.

846
00:55:14,333 --> 00:55:15,791
Did he say why he was hiding?

847
00:55:15,875 --> 00:55:16,875
No.

848
00:55:16,958 --> 00:55:18,916
But he said he was
in big trouble.

849
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:20,500
What kind of trouble?

850
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:22,500
The bad kind.

851
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:25,875
How did you two meet?

852
00:55:26,458 --> 00:55:27,458
[sighs]

853
00:55:28,708 --> 00:55:30,333
He saw my ad online.

854
00:55:35,166 --> 00:55:37,416
- What’re you doing?
- Your code?

855
00:55:39,083 --> 00:55:40,083
[scoffs]

856
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:44,208
My partners are outside. We can turn the
place upside down. Just give me the code.

857
00:55:46,041 --> 00:55:47,541
Three-nine-four-seven.

858
00:55:50,166 --> 00:55:53,250
Three… Fuck me.
Three-four-nine-seven. I forget.

859
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:54,750
Shit.

860
00:55:55,625 --> 00:55:56,958
You have his number in here?

861
00:55:58,750 --> 00:56:00,708
It’s not any good.
It’s out of service.

862
00:56:00,791 --> 00:56:02,517
- How do you call him?
- I wait for his call.

863
00:56:02,541 --> 00:56:04,809
- Where’s he call from?
- It’s a burner, always different.

864
00:56:04,833 --> 00:56:06,833
[siren wailing in the distance]

865
00:56:12,333 --> 00:56:13,583
Where was this?

866
00:56:14,583 --> 00:56:15,916
The Rex Club.

867
00:56:21,041 --> 00:56:22,291
Who are the other women?

868
00:56:23,375 --> 00:56:24,500
Work friends.

869
00:56:25,708 --> 00:56:26,708
Their names?

870
00:56:28,333 --> 00:56:29,416
No idea.

871
00:56:30,041 --> 00:56:31,250
You’re not helping much.

872
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:33,333
I don’t pay too much attention.

873
00:56:33,833 --> 00:56:34,958
I focus on the client.

874
00:56:38,541 --> 00:56:39,625
[exhales]

875
00:56:40,208 --> 00:56:42,500
[suspenseful music playing]

876
00:56:52,708 --> 00:56:53,875
Do you know these guys?

877
00:56:55,333 --> 00:56:57,291
No. That’s the first
time I saw them.

878
00:57:01,375 --> 00:57:02,375
Do you mind?

879
00:57:11,833 --> 00:57:12,833
Here.

880
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:18,625
If Richard gets in touch with
you, call me on this number, okay?

881
00:57:20,458 --> 00:57:21,958
It might just keep him alive.

882
00:57:22,958 --> 00:57:25,166
He’s supposed to call
soon to fix a meet-up.

883
00:57:25,916 --> 00:57:27,041
Give me five grand.

884
00:57:27,125 --> 00:57:28,291
I’ll give you the info.

885
00:57:32,583 --> 00:57:34,583
[horns honking in the distance]

886
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:45,630
[Hanna's] <i>Hi, this is
Hanna. Leave me a message.</i>

887
00:57:45,666 --> 00:57:46,541
[phone beeps]

888
00:57:46,625 --> 00:57:48,208
Yeah, hi. Sorry I missed you.

889
00:57:48,833 --> 00:57:51,916
Uh, I just sent you a picture. I
need you to identify the women in it.

890
00:57:52,416 --> 00:57:54,500
And the guy next to
Mahmoudi, please.

891
00:57:54,583 --> 00:57:55,583
Thanks.

892
00:57:57,541 --> 00:57:59,291
You really need to
drop this thing.

893
00:57:59,791 --> 00:58:01,750
The further you go, the
more shit you’ll attract.

894
00:58:01,833 --> 00:58:03,000
Yeah, I’ve been told already.

895
00:58:03,583 --> 00:58:04,791
[engine starts]

896
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:46,583
Hey, relax.

897
00:58:46,666 --> 00:58:47,666
It’s handled.

898
00:58:48,208 --> 00:58:49,875
We’re good. It’s
just you and me.

899
00:58:50,750 --> 00:58:52,625
Yeah, you’re right.
I should do that.

900
00:58:53,416 --> 00:58:54,416
Relax.

901
00:58:55,125 --> 00:58:56,500
Where’re we going?

902
00:58:56,583 --> 00:58:57,833
A place in Saint-Mandé.

903
00:58:58,875 --> 00:59:01,041
It was last minute. The
next one’ll be better, okay?

904
00:59:02,875 --> 00:59:05,250
You still haven’t explained
why I can’t go home.

905
00:59:07,916 --> 00:59:10,791
- Tell me why I can’t go see my wife?
- Don’t fucking start!

906
00:59:10,875 --> 00:59:12,500
It’s that hooker’s fault!

907
00:59:12,583 --> 00:59:15,791
If she’d kept her mouth shut, we
wouldn’t be here. Fuckin’ bitch!

908
00:59:24,666 --> 00:59:26,375
Who the fuck went
to question her?

909
00:59:27,458 --> 00:59:28,458
[sniffs]

910
00:59:29,416 --> 00:59:31,166
Antoine. He’s been
looking for you.

911
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:34,541
I don’t understand.

912
00:59:34,625 --> 00:59:37,184
Why would he be involved in this?
He’s got nothing to do with it.

913
00:59:37,208 --> 00:59:39,333
No idea. Ask him next
time you see him.

914
00:59:41,375 --> 00:59:43,125
Listen, Richard.
This is important.

915
00:59:44,208 --> 00:59:46,875
You don’t leave this place
until I say it’s okay. Hey!

916
00:59:46,958 --> 00:59:47,958
I mean it!

917
00:59:49,291 --> 00:59:51,125
Just sit tight ’til
I sort this out.

918
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:54,458
They’re closing
in. I can feel it.

919
00:59:54,541 --> 00:59:55,958
[dramatic music playing]

920
00:59:56,041 --> 00:59:57,041
We’re fucked.

921
01:00:14,625 --> 01:00:16,791
SEARCH AND INTERVENTION
SQUAD PARIS

922
01:00:29,166 --> 01:00:30,333
What’re you doing here?

923
01:00:31,333 --> 01:00:32,625
We need to talk, Sami.

924
01:00:33,375 --> 01:00:34,791
- Oh yeah?
- [Antoine] Yeah.

925
01:00:35,958 --> 01:00:37,416
You want your old job back?

926
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,291
There’s two spots open.

927
01:00:40,375 --> 01:00:41,875
Three if you count Richard.

928
01:00:41,958 --> 01:00:43,833
Right now, he’s
still on the payroll.

929
01:00:44,958 --> 01:00:46,250
I know somebody fucked up.

930
01:00:47,041 --> 01:00:48,041
Fucked up what?

931
01:00:48,583 --> 01:00:51,625
Two members of your team get shot
and a third one’s gone missing.

932
01:00:52,291 --> 01:00:54,500
- I’m not an idiot.
- There’s an investigation going on.

933
01:00:54,583 --> 01:00:57,183
- Talk to the ones running it...
- Can you stop with the bullshit?

934
01:00:58,250 --> 01:01:01,000
A guy like Richard doesn’t
get paranoid overnight.

935
01:01:01,083 --> 01:01:02,291
But he did go over the edge.

936
01:01:04,125 --> 01:01:06,000
And you have to know
what pushed him.

937
01:01:08,583 --> 01:01:10,625
Do you know how many cops
kill themselves each year?

938
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:12,125
Hmm?

939
01:01:13,291 --> 01:01:14,291
Over one per week.

940
01:01:15,291 --> 01:01:16,891
And it doesn’t mean
they’ve gone corrupt

941
01:01:16,916 --> 01:01:19,166
or been driven over the
fuckin’ edge, as you say.

942
01:01:19,250 --> 01:01:20,708
You know why they check out?

943
01:01:22,125 --> 01:01:23,458
Because they’re depressed.

944
01:01:24,041 --> 01:01:26,267
'Cause they’re sick of being
treated like a piece of shit

945
01:01:26,291 --> 01:01:28,958
by those they’re supposed to
protect. That’s why they do it.

946
01:01:30,333 --> 01:01:32,541
Your buddy Richard was
no exception, Antoine.

947
01:01:35,208 --> 01:01:37,291
Where the hell were you
when he started to lose it?

948
01:01:37,791 --> 01:01:41,333
Hmm? When he started checking
his office every morning.

949
01:01:41,416 --> 01:01:43,958
Making sure there were no
bugs or other shit like that.

950
01:01:44,458 --> 01:01:47,833
He changed his phone every week. He
thought people were following him.

951
01:01:47,916 --> 01:01:49,875
And he started to
become dangerous.

952
01:01:49,958 --> 01:01:51,041
You abandoned him.

953
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,000
But I stood by him.

954
01:01:57,208 --> 01:02:00,328
- I’m the one who sent him to the clinic...
- You can’t fool me with this shit.

955
01:02:00,708 --> 01:02:02,541
Richard's one of the
toughest guys I know.

956
01:02:03,041 --> 01:02:04,841
So whatever the hell
made him run, it was big.

957
01:02:04,875 --> 01:02:06,000
That’s what you think?

958
01:02:07,333 --> 01:02:08,625
Everybody cracks.

959
01:02:08,708 --> 01:02:11,434
I know you’re lying, Sami, because
I’ve heard the rumors going around.

960
01:02:11,458 --> 01:02:12,791
Advice from an old friend?

961
01:02:12,875 --> 01:02:15,083
They’re just rumors. So
stay the fuck out of it.

962
01:02:23,458 --> 01:02:24,978
So I shouldn’t ask
what you were doing

963
01:02:25,041 --> 01:02:26,761
with Mahmoudi and these
escorts at the club?

964
01:02:26,791 --> 01:02:28,041
That’d be best.

965
01:02:28,625 --> 01:02:29,916
How about the SI team?

966
01:02:34,833 --> 01:02:35,833
It’s defunct.

967
01:02:37,916 --> 01:02:38,916
It’s about to be.

968
01:02:42,125 --> 01:02:43,375
Give my regards to Hanna.

969
01:02:48,041 --> 01:02:49,208
You got back together.

970
01:02:50,041 --> 01:02:51,208
So rumor has it.

971
01:02:51,791 --> 01:02:53,416
Don’t bring her into this, Sami.

972
01:03:01,416 --> 01:03:02,500

<i>You have the cash?</i>

978
01:03:19,541 --> 01:03:20,791
Yeah, I’ll have the cash.

982
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:44,851
- How's it going?
- Good. You?

983
01:03:44,875 --> 01:03:45,875
Good, thanks.

01:04:57,625 --> 01:04:58,458
Five grand?

992
01:04:58,541 --> 01:04:59,750
It’s all here.

993
01:05:01,166 --> 01:05:02,166
[tires squeal]

994
01:05:02,208 --> 01:05:04,916
- Where is he?
- Your friend’s on his way. Hand it over.

995
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:05,833
I don’t think so.

996
01:05:05,916 --> 01:05:07,756
You only get it when I
see Richard. Understood?

997
01:05:07,833 --> 01:05:08,833
[tires squealing]

998
01:05:08,875 --> 01:05:10,875
I’m not sticking around.
I did what you asked.

[Wagner] <i>I really wish you’d
taken my advice, Captain.</i>

1005
01:05:43,666 --> 01:05:46,291
It would have saved us from
enforcing a mandatory suspension

1006
01:05:46,375 --> 01:05:47,833
and other disciplinary measures

1007
01:05:47,916 --> 01:05:50,250
that we have no choice
but to put into action.

1008
01:05:51,125 --> 01:05:53,666
Besides the fact that the young
escort died because of you.

1009
01:05:54,958 --> 01:05:57,833
Unfortunately, she’ll be quickly
forgotten. But to make matters worse,

1010
01:05:57,916 --> 01:06:00,541
she was our only means of
contacting Richard Esteves.

1011
01:06:02,916 --> 01:06:06,666
Besides the ammunition from your
gun, the slugs we found at the scene

1012
01:06:06,750 --> 01:06:10,416
are an exact ballistics match for those
we found to have caused the deaths

1013
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:12,791
of Vinny Segura
and Walid Jabrane.

1014
01:06:13,291 --> 01:06:16,250
The forensic report confirms
that the slugs recovered

1015
01:06:16,333 --> 01:06:18,083
all came from the same weapon.

1016
01:06:18,166 --> 01:06:22,791
A police-issue SIG
Sauer 9 mm SP2022.

1017
01:06:22,875 --> 01:06:26,125
Which my weapons database shows
is registered to an officer named…

1018
01:06:26,625 --> 01:06:27,833
Richard Esteves.

1019
01:06:27,916 --> 01:06:30,416
He would never kill a fellow
cop. This doesn’t make any sense.

1020
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:31,500
[scoffs]

1021
01:06:32,916 --> 01:06:33,916
Doesn’t it, though?

1022
01:06:35,750 --> 01:06:37,333
Fifteen years in this
job has taught me

1023
01:06:37,416 --> 01:06:39,601
that human nature makes no
sense when it comes to crime.

1024
01:06:39,625 --> 01:06:41,625
[somber music playing]

1025
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:46,267
Tell me how you found out your
friend was linked to that escort,

1026
01:06:46,291 --> 01:06:47,375
Kristina Dankeva.

1027
01:06:48,083 --> 01:06:50,875
I got her number from a guy Richard
met while he was in treatment.

1028
01:06:51,916 --> 01:06:52,833
Really?

1029
01:06:52,916 --> 01:06:54,125
Yes.

1030
01:06:54,958 --> 01:06:57,291
And you thought best not
to share that with us?

1031
01:06:59,458 --> 01:07:00,458
Too bad.

1032
01:07:01,083 --> 01:07:03,208
Your decision not only
compromised our investigation,

1033
01:07:03,291 --> 01:07:05,125
it ultimately killed that girl.

1034
01:07:08,833 --> 01:07:10,208
[somber music continues]

1035
01:07:11,875 --> 01:07:15,291
Do you have other information that
we might not be privy to, Captain?

1036
01:07:16,250 --> 01:07:18,210
What am I supposed to know
that you don’t already?

1037
01:07:18,250 --> 01:07:19,750
Don’t be a smart ass, Antoine.

1038
01:07:20,958 --> 01:07:22,958
If you’re not looking
at time in prison,

1039
01:07:23,875 --> 01:07:27,333
it’s only because we don’t want to
unleash the scandal of the century.

1040
01:07:28,375 --> 01:07:29,708
A cop killer in the ranks?

1041
01:07:30,375 --> 01:07:31,833
Besides the damage
to the community,

1042
01:07:31,916 --> 01:07:34,125
imagine the fuckin’
field day for the press.

1043
01:07:38,166 --> 01:07:40,526
The prefect and the DA are
willing to sweep your involvement

1044
01:07:40,583 --> 01:07:42,458
in last night’s
disaster under the rug.

1045
01:07:43,125 --> 01:07:44,750
But they insist on a suspension.

1046

We don’t know for
how long yet. I mean…

1047
01:07:48,166 --> 01:07:52,041
for as long as it takes to stop Richard
and let the story die down on its own.

1048
01:07:52,833 --> 01:07:54,375
It’s effective immediately.

1049
01:07:54,458 --> 01:07:57,041
So please hand over your
weapon and your badge.

1050
01:08:08,625 --> 01:08:12,333
I’m sure you understand that you need
to remain discreet about all this.

1051
01:08:12,916 --> 01:08:13,916
Just like we’re doing

1052
01:08:13,958 --> 01:08:17,208
regarding the significant amount
of cash you borrowed from evidence.

1053
01:08:17,291 --> 01:08:20,125
And that we expect you
to return, of course.

1059
01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:38,875
- What’d you get?
- [Antoine] Fuckin' suspension.

1060
01:08:39,625 --> 01:08:41,583
- [Titus] For how long?
- [Antoine] TBD.

1061
01:08:42,333 --> 01:08:45,583
However long it takes for them to make
some shit up to cover their asses.

1062
01:08:45,666 --> 01:08:46,666
[Titus] Assholes.

1063
01:08:47,250 --> 01:08:48,625
What’re you gonna do?

1064
01:08:48,708 --> 01:08:50,851
I'm gonna try and find Richard
before anyone else does.

1065
01:08:50,875 --> 01:08:54,416
[Titus] You have a death wish?
These people stop at nothing.

1066
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:56,833
If I were in your shoes,
I’d head out to the country.

1067
01:08:56,916 --> 01:08:59,958
Keep my head way down. Why
can’t you just let it drop, man?

1068
01:09:00,041 --> 01:09:01,416
Because he’s my friend.

Take care.

1072
01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:10,125
You be careful out there.

1073
01:09:10,208 --> 01:09:11,250
Tell Zoe that too.

- [Antoine] Right.

1080
01:09:54,958 --> 01:09:56,438
- [Antoine] No, just straight.
- Okay.

You’re talking to her.

What do you want?

1087
01:10:10,916 --> 01:10:12,208
I was in the Anti-Gang unit.

1088
01:10:13,625 --> 01:10:15,333
I was friends with Vinny Segura.

1089
01:10:15,416 --> 01:10:17,875
I told the other hundred cops
who came here everything I know.

1090

Why don’t you go talk to them?

1091
01:10:20,666 --> 01:10:22,041
I’ve got a business to run.

The guy with the mustache,
next to Vinny, who is he?

1093
01:10:32,166 --> 01:10:33,708
You ever heard of harassment?

His name’s Serge Oswald.

Associated with organized
crime, a record a mile long…

1110
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:00,083
I put together a file with all the
information I could find. You want it now?

- <i>Can you meet at my place in an hour?</i>
- Sure.

Did you find anything
else on Mahmoudi?

1113

Still nothing, no address,
contacts or numbers.

1114
01:12:07,458 --> 01:12:10,291
I talked to my contacts at Interpol,
they said he’s out of the country.

for me? Here I am.

What do you want?

1128
01:13:29,791 --> 01:13:30,916
Richard Esteves.

1129
01:13:32,750 --> 01:13:34,250
Can you be more specific?

1130
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:37,580
Is he still alive or did
you put a bullet in him too?

1131
01:13:37,625 --> 01:13:38,500
What do you mean?

1132
01:13:38,583 --> 01:13:41,750
I saw a picture of you with Sami
Belkaïm and Richard Esteves at the Rex.

1133
01:13:41,833 --> 01:13:42,666
And?

They’ve been tailing you for two
years, why were you together?

1135

That’s not your concern.

I didn’t. That’s number one.

care where Esteves is.

balls with your bullshit theories.

And your address.

1145
01:14:21,083 --> 01:14:22,083
So listen carefully.

1146
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:24,708
Forget me.

up and breaking all your limbs.

01:14:31,083 --> 01:14:32,333

I’m heading back to the station.
Something came up on a case.

1156
01:14:45,708 --> 01:14:47,333
I left the file in your mailbox.

1157
01:14:48,333 --> 01:14:49,333
I don’t like this.

1158
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,250
Just let me know if
everything’s okay, please.

know a good moving company.

And that you like
the quiet life.

1165
01:16:13,583 --> 01:16:16,458
Because if we don’t get this
mess figured out in two days,

1166
01:16:17,208 --> 01:16:18,958
we’re all in the same
career-ending boat.

1167
01:16:19,041 --> 01:16:22,250
That probably requires
collaboration among departments.

1168

Internal’s dragging their feet,

1169
01:16:23,791 --> 01:16:26,517
cops cover each other's asses, and
the Crime Unit won’t share a thing.

1170
01:16:26,541 --> 01:16:28,750
That’s the nature of the
game. What do you expect?

1171
01:16:28,833 --> 01:16:29,958
Mmm.

1172
01:16:30,041 --> 01:16:31,166
You have a suggestion?

1173
01:16:31,958 --> 01:16:32,958
Cerda.

1174
01:16:33,541 --> 01:16:35,041
A loose cannon, but efficient.

1175
01:16:36,958 --> 01:16:38,041
- Efficient?
- Mmm.

1176
01:16:38,125 --> 01:16:39,416
And dangerous.

1177
01:16:40,916 --> 01:16:44,083
That’s what you put in your report when
you forced him to another department.

1178
01:16:44,166 --> 01:16:45,166
[De Brandt sighs]

1179
01:16:45,916 --> 01:16:47,083
Your loose cannon was found

1180
01:16:47,166 --> 01:16:49,833
in the middle of an industrial
lot in Argenteuil last night.

1181
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:53,208
Hands tied behind his back
and signs of a good beating.

1182
01:16:54,958 --> 01:16:57,291
Anti-Crime just happened
to be on patrol there.

1183
01:16:58,291 --> 01:17:01,250
As you might expect, he’s
refusing to press charges.

1184
01:17:01,916 --> 01:17:03,666
Or say anything or see a doctor.

1185
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,708
The only thing we know is
that witnesses saw him forced

1186
01:17:07,791 --> 01:17:11,125
into a van outside the club where Vinny
Segura was the night he was killed.

1187
01:17:11,208 --> 01:17:13,375
According to statements,
there were at least two guys

1188
01:17:13,458 --> 01:17:17,791
who took off with him in a black van.
The plates were apparently German.

1189
01:17:19,041 --> 01:17:20,166
And that’s all we got.

1190
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:23,000
So I hit the nail on the head.

1191
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:24,940
Because it shows
he touched a nerve,

1192
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,166
and they sent a message,
which means he’s close.

1193
01:17:27,833 --> 01:17:29,791
Why don’t you just
lift his suspension?

1194
01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:33,625
Personnel changes like
that go through Nabavian.

1195
01:17:34,250 --> 01:17:35,416
That asshole decides.

1196
01:17:35,916 --> 01:17:38,541
And he’s the one shitting
bricks since the beginning.

1197
01:17:38,625 --> 01:17:39,833
[De Brandt] Why is that?

1198
01:17:40,750 --> 01:17:42,470
Even if we manage to
get this under control,

1199
01:17:42,541 --> 01:17:44,166
a whole lot will be kept secret.

1200
01:17:44,958 --> 01:17:47,958
And I’m not so sure Antoine’s
willing to bury more skeletons.

1201
01:17:48,625 --> 01:17:50,500
Which is why he was
suspended, of course.

1202
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,000
And you?

1203
01:17:52,666 --> 01:17:53,906
- What?
- [De Brandt] Skeletons?

1204
01:17:54,375 --> 01:17:56,708
I’ve been doing this a
long time. [chuckles]

1205
01:17:56,791 --> 01:17:58,000
I learned the rules.

1206
01:17:58,083 --> 01:17:59,083
[birds chirping]

1207
01:18:01,833 --> 01:18:04,750
I received the report from Forensics,
and there’s no doubt about it.

1208
01:18:04,833 --> 01:18:06,166
It’s the same assailant.

1209
01:18:06,250 --> 01:18:09,416
Well, it’s the same weapon, sure, but
we don’t know who pulled the trigger.

1210
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:11,416
Well, two of my teams
from the Bastion

1211
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:13,833
have been specially
mandated as of this morning

1212
01:18:13,916 --> 01:18:16,250
to search the Anti-Gang
offices from top to bottom.

1213
01:18:16,333 --> 01:18:19,666
They’ll run point on the investigation.
So you’re no longer involved.

1214
01:18:19,750 --> 01:18:20,625
Are you serious?

1215
01:18:20,708 --> 01:18:23,375
As serious as the Prefect
and the Prosecutor’s office.

1216
01:18:23,458 --> 01:18:25,333
Look, I’m really sorry.
My hands are tied.

1217
01:18:25,416 --> 01:18:26,833
I’m still not understanding.

1218
01:18:26,916 --> 01:18:29,250
It means we find other cases
that need our attention

1219
01:18:29,333 --> 01:18:30,833
and let the Crime
Unit get dirty.

1220
01:18:32,291 --> 01:18:35,625
I did manage to get authorization
to raid the Rex Nightclub tonight

1221
01:18:35,708 --> 01:18:37,000
to talk to staff and patrons.

1222
01:18:37,083 --> 01:18:40,083
Hopefully we can get hold of the
girl that talked to Captain Cerda.

1223
01:18:40,166 --> 01:18:41,916
I think it all started
in that fucking club.

1224
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,000
[Balestra] Mmm.

1225
01:18:43,583 --> 01:18:46,166
Does anyone know what he was
doing there? Did he tell you?

1226
01:18:46,250 --> 01:18:48,666
I’m pretty sure an officer
who’s suspended from active duty

1227
01:18:48,750 --> 01:18:50,208
can drink wherever he wants.

1228
01:18:50,291 --> 01:18:51,291
Hmm?

1229
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,960
A valiant effort to protect
your troops, Director,

1230
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:55,958
which is likely to sink
the ship with you in it.

1231
01:18:56,041 --> 01:18:57,708
You are aware of that, right?

1232
01:18:57,791 --> 01:18:59,166
[suspenseful music playing]

1233
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:02,375
I’ll see you.

1234
01:19:06,916 --> 01:19:08,500
[sad music playing]

1235
01:19:10,583 --> 01:19:12,250
[door opens]

1236
01:19:15,583 --> 01:19:16,666
[door closes]

1237
01:19:28,666 --> 01:19:30,000
I’m really sorry, Antoine.

1238
01:19:32,708 --> 01:19:35,000
There’s no way Richard
would have done this to her.

1239
01:19:35,083 --> 01:19:37,083
[music becomes pulsing]

1240
01:19:41,958 --> 01:19:42,958
[music stops]

1241
01:19:45,208 --> 01:19:46,208
[indistinct chatter]

1242
01:19:52,625 --> 01:19:53,625
[door closes]

1243
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,208
[De Brandt] Can we talk?

1244
01:19:57,541 --> 01:19:58,541
I don't know.

1245
01:19:59,208 --> 01:20:02,088
I thought you only talked to people
when you were about to give ’em shit.

1246
01:20:03,958 --> 01:20:07,375
I acknowledge your methods don’t
always fall within the guidelines.

1247
01:20:07,875 --> 01:20:10,934
I disagree with some of your actions, but
I never said you weren’t a good cop...

1248
01:20:10,958 --> 01:20:14,000
Save the speech. It won’t help
anything. What do you want?

1249
01:20:14,791 --> 01:20:15,958
I might have some information

1250
01:20:16,041 --> 01:20:18,875
that would help your investigation
concerning Richard Esteves.

1251
01:20:18,958 --> 01:20:20,708
Yeah, well, it's
too late for that.

1252
01:20:20,791 --> 01:20:23,000
Find someone on active
duty who gives a shit.

1253
01:20:25,125 --> 01:20:27,125
Your former colleague is
being made the scapegoat

1254
01:20:27,208 --> 01:20:29,291
for some serious
crimes, and you know it.

1255
01:20:30,666 --> 01:20:33,750
I’m not a shrink, but in my experience,
cops don’t run away from the clinic,

1256
01:20:33,833 --> 01:20:36,583
for the sole purpose of executing
their friends and colleagues.

1257
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,000
Who did it then?

1258
01:20:39,041 --> 01:20:41,041
[intriguing music playing]

1259
01:20:41,625 --> 01:20:42,625
We don’t know.

1260
01:20:46,958 --> 01:20:49,916
We’ve been running surveillance on
a team put together by Sami Belkaïm

1261
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,000
for a few months now.

1262
01:20:51,458 --> 01:20:53,892
There were rumors that they were
engaged in illegal activities

1263
01:20:53,916 --> 01:20:56,791
under the orders of the Ministry of
Interior and high-level officials.

1264
01:20:56,875 --> 01:20:57,875
[music continues]

1265
01:20:58,958 --> 01:21:02,291
Belkaim and his team worked on a
drug-trafficking case with Narcotics.

1266
01:21:02,375 --> 01:21:05,583
The organization is based in Gennevilliers
and run by a guy named Karim.

1267
01:21:06,083 --> 01:21:08,416
We haven’t been able
to identify him yet…

1268
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:10,500
but we do have a phone
conversation we intercepted

1269
01:21:10,583 --> 01:21:13,166
that happened after an
apparent delivery went south.

1270
01:21:14,708 --> 01:21:15,791
It involves Belkaïm.

1271
01:21:16,625 --> 01:21:19,125
This Karim guy called
Sami from a burner phone.

1272
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:22,666
We can hear him saying that some of
his guys were ambushed in the night

1273
01:21:22,750 --> 01:21:25,083
and that his nephew, named
Ichem, had gone missing

1274
01:21:25,166 --> 01:21:26,583
and he wanted Sami’s help.

1275
01:21:27,541 --> 01:21:28,958
To find who was responsible.

1276
01:21:29,041 --> 01:21:30,458
[pulsing music playing]

1277
01:21:31,291 --> 01:21:34,250
And that phone call pretty much
coincides with Esteves getting paranoid.

1278
01:21:34,875 --> 01:21:36,375
And things went off the rails.

1279
01:21:39,041 --> 01:21:40,541
Why are you telling me all this?

1280
01:21:42,083 --> 01:21:44,083
Because I’m pretty
sure you met Karim.

1281
01:21:45,916 --> 01:21:48,208
I’m coming to you to
help me neutralize him.

1282
01:21:48,291 --> 01:21:49,583
- Really?
- Hmm.

1283
01:21:49,666 --> 01:21:51,166
What good would that do me?

1284
01:21:51,250 --> 01:21:53,958
For one you can find out who
tried to kill your girlfriend.

1285
01:21:54,041 --> 01:21:55,708
[siren wailing]

1286
01:21:59,958 --> 01:22:02,291
If you were so suspicious
of Sami and his unit…

1287
01:22:03,208 --> 01:22:06,458
why didn’t you bring them in
to find out the truth? Huh?

1288
01:22:06,958 --> 01:22:09,333
It could’ve prevented two
murders and all this other shit.

1289
01:22:09,416 --> 01:22:12,083
We would've investigated earlier,
but we had explicit orders

1290
01:22:12,166 --> 01:22:15,541
not to interfere with any operations
involving the unit and Belkaïm.

1291
01:22:17,125 --> 01:22:19,958
Actually, we’ve just been
officially kicked off the case.

1292
01:22:21,041 --> 01:22:23,458
Wagner’s Crime Unit is
exclusively in charge now.

1293
01:22:24,416 --> 01:22:25,583
Why’s that?

1294
01:22:26,666 --> 01:22:27,916
National Interest.

1295
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:31,583
We don’t kill cops for state
secrets. I don’t believe that.

1296
01:22:31,666 --> 01:22:34,041
Officers get killed for
less than that nowadays.

1297
01:22:35,458 --> 01:22:39,125
And management’ll take a dead cop over
a dirty one any day. You know that.

1298
01:22:42,750 --> 01:22:43,666
[music stops]

1299

[door closes]

1302
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,625
OFFICIAL STATEMENT

1303
01:23:11,250 --> 01:23:14,750
I don’t know what you’ve gotten yourself
into, but you look pissed off as hell.

1304
01:23:15,375 --> 01:23:17,250
Reminds me of my old
man when he found out

1305
01:23:17,333 --> 01:23:20,041
my mom was fucking him over
with his very own brother.

1306
01:23:21,250 --> 01:23:24,125
He put a bullet into both of
them in the middle of dinner.

1307
01:23:24,208 --> 01:23:26,291
Then finished himself
off right after.

1308
01:23:26,791 --> 01:23:28,208
He forgot one thing, though.

1309
01:23:29,041 --> 01:23:31,416
My little brother and I
were still at the table.

1310
01:23:32,125 --> 01:23:33,125
Here.

1311
01:23:33,958 --> 01:23:34,958
She’s a beast.

1312
01:23:35,875 --> 01:23:39,166
Bring her back in the same
condition. That’s all I ask. Got it?

1313
01:23:40,333 --> 01:23:41,166
Here.

1314
01:23:41,250 --> 01:23:43,250
[intriguing music playing]

1315
01:23:43,333 --> 01:23:44,250
And the gun?

1316
01:23:44,333 --> 01:23:47,750
Beretta 92 with an extra magazine.
You’ll find it in the glove box.

1317
01:23:48,708 --> 01:23:49,708
Thanks, Marcus.

1318
01:23:50,208 --> 01:23:51,208
I owe you one.

1319
01:23:51,625 --> 01:23:52,666
Sure, kid.

1320
01:23:52,750 --> 01:23:53,750
Hey.

1321
01:23:54,375 --> 01:23:55,958
You watch your back, all right?

1381
01:28:09,583 --> 01:28:10,666
[banging on door]

1382
01:28:11,541 --> 01:28:14,625
[doorbell ringing]

1383
01:28:19,166 --> 01:28:21,583
[Sami] Why didn’t you stay at
the safe house like I told you?

1384
01:28:21,666 --> 01:28:22,958
Shut the door!

1385
01:28:23,041 --> 01:28:25,166
- [door closes]
- Hey! Answer me!

1386
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,416
Why are you here?

1387
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,708
You’re putting
everything at risk.

1388
01:28:31,791 --> 01:28:32,791
It’s over, Sami.

1389
01:28:32,875 --> 01:28:34,666
Grow a fucking pair, Richard!

1390
01:28:36,166 --> 01:28:38,833
I’m getting everything
straightened out. And now this?

1391
01:28:40,333 --> 01:28:41,250
It’s all good.

1392
01:28:41,333 --> 01:28:42,333
We’re almost there.

1393
01:28:44,208 --> 01:28:46,708
There’s one last thing I need to
do, and then we’re outta here.

1394
01:28:47,208 --> 01:28:49,375
Just like we planned
but you gotta trust me.

1395
01:28:50,708 --> 01:28:52,458
Hey. Hmm?

1396
01:28:54,375 --> 01:28:56,375
[suspenseful music continues]

1397
01:28:57,541 --> 01:28:59,125
I can’t take it anymore, Sami.

1398
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:02,375
Vinny and Walid are
dead because of us.

1399
01:29:04,458 --> 01:29:07,416
Hanna could be dying at that hospital
even though she wasn’t involved.

1400
01:29:09,666 --> 01:29:10,833
They know what we did.

1401
01:29:12,291 --> 01:29:14,291
What the fuck don’t
you understand?

1402
01:29:15,625 --> 01:29:18,166
[sobbing softly]

1403
01:29:26,958 --> 01:29:29,684
If we don’t give them what they want,
they’ll come after our families.

1404
01:29:29,708 --> 01:29:30,708
You know that.

1405
01:29:32,291 --> 01:29:33,291
What’s he saying?

1406
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,333
- Leave him alone, sweetheart.
- No, I want an answer.

1407
01:29:36,416 --> 01:29:37,541
[Sofia] What’d you do?

1408
01:29:40,083 --> 01:29:41,083
Nothing.

1409
01:29:42,416 --> 01:29:43,416
He’s stressed out.

1410
01:29:52,958 --> 01:29:54,375
Why do you have my gun, man?

1411
01:29:57,500 --> 01:29:58,500
Sami…

1412
01:29:59,875 --> 01:30:00,916
What’s going on?

1413
01:30:04,291 --> 01:30:05,500
I told you I was fixing it.

1414
01:30:05,583 --> 01:30:07,083
- Sami…
- Huh?

1415
01:30:10,416 --> 01:30:11,416
[groans]

1416
01:30:19,291 --> 01:30:22,000

[dog barking in the distance]

1418
01:30:33,250 --> 01:30:34,916
Yes. This is Officer Belkaïm.

1419
01:30:35,666 --> 01:30:38,625
I need to report two casualties
at the home of Captain…

1420
01:30:38,708 --> 01:30:39,833
Richard Esteves.

1421
01:30:40,833 --> 01:30:41,750
It looks like a…

1422
01:30:41,833 --> 01:30:43,583
a murder-suicide, unfortunately.

1423
01:30:47,833 --> 01:30:49,125
Call Balestra and…

1424
01:30:49,208 --> 01:30:50,041
Crime.

1425
01:30:50,125 --> 01:30:50,958
I’ll stay here.

1426
01:30:51,041 --> 01:30:51,875
[sniffs]

1427
01:30:51,958 --> 01:30:53,416

[music fades]

[door slams]

1432
01:32:39,833 --> 01:32:41,833
[breathing nervously]

1433
01:32:51,708 --> 01:32:52,708
[dogs barking]

1434
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,041
[man 1 muffled] Don’t
you fuckin’ look at me.

1435
01:33:08,958 --> 01:33:10,166
[man 1] Lower your eyes.

1436
01:33:12,291 --> 01:33:13,750
[man 2] He said lower your eyes.

1437
01:33:21,583 --> 01:33:23,263
[man 1] Not such a
smart ass now, are you?

1438
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:27,750
[car approaches]

1439
01:33:31,791 --> 01:33:33,041

[door slams]

1443
01:33:56,250 --> 01:33:57,375
Where’d you pick him up?

1444
01:33:57,458 --> 01:33:58,791
[man 2] Outside
a hooker’s place.

1445
01:33:58,875 --> 01:34:00,666
Stuck on that island
for three months.

1446
01:34:00,750 --> 01:34:02,875
Came back because he
was too fuckin’ horny.

1447
01:34:02,958 --> 01:34:04,375
Who told you where he was?

1448
01:34:04,458 --> 01:34:06,083
A kid in the building next door.

1449
01:34:07,625 --> 01:34:09,166
Did you enjoy your
little getaway?

1450
01:34:09,833 --> 01:34:10,833
Have a good time?

1451
01:34:14,583 --> 01:34:15,583
Tyson, right?

1452
01:34:18,750 --> 01:34:19,750
You know who I am?

1453
01:34:21,666 --> 01:34:22,666
Do you?

1454
01:34:23,458 --> 01:34:24,791
I’ll keep it simple then.

1455
01:34:25,375 --> 01:34:28,750
You can tell me exactly what happened
to my nephew three months ago,

1456
01:34:28,833 --> 01:34:31,583
and why you haven’t tried to
get in touch with us since then.

1457
01:34:32,666 --> 01:34:35,291
Or I make you suffer like
you never thought possible.

1458
01:34:36,375 --> 01:34:37,708
Go ahead. I’m listening,

1459
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:40,000
[coughs]

1460
01:34:41,625 --> 01:34:43,934
Ichem and I were gonna pick up
a shipment of coke in Spain.

1461
01:34:43,958 --> 01:34:46,166
I know where you were going,
because it was my cash.

1462
01:34:46,250 --> 01:34:48,333
We drove at night to
avoid the patrols.

1463
01:34:48,416 --> 01:34:49,666
[suspenseful music playing]

1464
01:34:49,750 --> 01:34:52,375
[Tyson] <i>We stopped at a rest
area to piss and get a coffee.</i>

1465
01:34:52,458 --> 01:34:55,083
I’m not pissing in a fucking
bottle. We’re making great time.

1466
01:34:55,166 --> 01:34:56,000
[scoffs]

1467
01:34:56,083 --> 01:34:57,166
[Mahmoudi] <i>And then?</i>

1468
01:34:57,250 --> 01:34:59,375
[Tyson] <i>That’s when those
assholes ambushed us.</i>

1469

["Cash" by PLK playing]

1470
01:35:06,250 --> 01:35:07,250
Ah!

[grunts]

1472
01:35:10,458 --> 01:35:12,017
- [man 1] Don’t move, asshole!
- [gasps]

1473
01:35:12,041 --> 01:35:15,291
[man 2] He said don’t move,
motherfucker! Pop the trunk. Do it!

1474
01:35:16,333 --> 01:35:18,541
They were all wearing
fucking Kevlar vests.

1475
01:35:18,625 --> 01:35:19,625
[dog barks]

1476
01:35:20,208 --> 01:35:21,250

[pulsing music playing]

1478
01:35:24,833 --> 01:35:26,433
- [man 1] Shoot this fucking thing!
- Ah!

1479
01:35:26,458 --> 01:35:27,708
[dog yelps]

1480
01:35:27,791 --> 01:35:29,583
- [man 3] Come on! Up!
- [groans]

1481
01:35:31,791 --> 01:35:32,791
[music fades]

1482
01:35:34,416 --> 01:35:35,416
So where were you?

1483
01:35:36,666 --> 01:35:39,291
- Pissing behind the bushes.
- And you didn’t help?

1484
01:35:39,375 --> 01:35:41,750
I was by myself with
no gun. It was useless.

1485
01:35:41,833 --> 01:35:43,375
It happened so fast, Karim.

1486
01:35:44,583 --> 01:35:45,500
Then what?

1487
01:35:45,583 --> 01:35:47,916
- [man 2] His partner?
- [man 4] Doesn’t matter, gotta go.

1488
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,875
[man 2] We can’t just
leave that fucker!

1489
01:35:49,958 --> 01:35:51,318
- [Richard] Sami!
- [Sami] Shut up!

1490
01:35:51,375 --> 01:35:52,500
We said no names, damn it!

1491
01:35:52,583 --> 01:35:54,625
[Richard] Let’s go before
anyone comes. Come on.

1492
01:35:54,708 --> 01:35:57,375
- [Sami] Shit!
- [Richard] Leave him! Come on!

1493
01:35:57,875 --> 01:35:59,475
- [Sami] The body!
- [Richard] Forget it!

1494
01:35:59,958 --> 01:36:01,125
[Sami] We can’t forget it!

1495
01:36:01,208 --> 01:36:02,375
[tense music playing]

1496
01:36:02,458 --> 01:36:03,458
Keep going.

1497
01:36:03,875 --> 01:36:07,250
- They took off with him and all the cash.
- [action music playing]

1498
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:09,000
[Sami] Keep it open!

1499
01:36:09,916 --> 01:36:11,396
- Fuck.
- [Richard] Come on! Hurry up.

1500
01:36:12,833 --> 01:36:13,833
[Richard] We gotta move!

1501
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:18,166
[tense music playing]

1502
01:36:19,125 --> 01:36:20,250
So they killed Ichem?

1503
01:36:21,375 --> 01:36:22,375
I think, yeah.

1504
01:36:23,208 --> 01:36:25,208
[breathes deeply]

1505
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,375
What’d you do after that?

1506
01:36:34,625 --> 01:36:36,333
I stayed hidden ’til morning.

1507
01:36:36,416 --> 01:36:38,333
And from there I
hitchhiked back here.

1508
01:36:39,791 --> 01:36:42,431
I took the first train to Portugal
and went straight to the island.

1509
01:36:43,666 --> 01:36:45,346
Why didn’t you come
straight to me, Tyson?

1510
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,250
Those fuckers took two
million from us, Karim.

1511
01:36:49,083 --> 01:36:51,375
And Ichem wasn’t around to
explain everything to you.

1512
01:36:51,458 --> 01:36:53,778
So I panicked thinking you
might think that I betrayed you.

1513
01:36:58,125 --> 01:36:59,708
These assholes, can
you describe them?

1514
01:37:00,750 --> 01:37:04,500
They had masks. All I can say is that
they didn’t act like any thief I know.

1515
01:37:04,583 --> 01:37:05,500
What do you mean?

1516
01:37:05,583 --> 01:37:08,375
You know? With guys from the
neighborhood, it’s always a mess.

1517
01:37:08,875 --> 01:37:11,333
These guys acted like they
were used to working together.

1518
01:37:11,833 --> 01:37:13,593
[Mahmoudi] You think
they could’ve been cops?

1519
01:37:14,541 --> 01:37:15,750
[Tyson] I don’t know.

1520
01:37:15,833 --> 01:37:16,875
Did you hear them?

1521
01:37:17,375 --> 01:37:18,708
I heard one use the name "Sami."

1522
01:37:20,541 --> 01:37:23,083
[Tyson] And he got really
pissed that he’d used his name.

1523
01:37:27,333 --> 01:37:29,416
I’m so sorry about Ichem, Karim.

1524
01:37:31,416 --> 01:37:32,791
We’ll give you a ride home.

1525
01:37:32,875 --> 01:37:34,083
[tense music continues]

1526
01:37:38,708 --> 01:37:39,875
[dogs barking]

1527
01:37:47,541 --> 01:37:49,875
[Mahmoudi] Rachid, you stay
here. Keep an eye on things.

1528
01:37:49,958 --> 01:37:51,398
[Rachid] What do I
do with this guy?

1529
01:37:52,083 --> 01:37:53,541
[Mahmoudi] We’ll
clean it up later.

1530

[cellphone vibrates]

1533
01:38:19,750 --> 01:38:23,125
MAHMOUDI KNOWS YOU DID
IT. HE'S COMING FOR YOU.

1534
01:38:23,208 --> 01:38:24,916
[suspenseful music playing]

1535
01:38:32,791 --> 01:38:34,031
Do you need me to stick around?

1536
01:38:34,083 --> 01:38:36,458
I’ve got a bit of an emergency
at home and Vanessa needs me.

1537
01:38:36,541 --> 01:38:38,666
Shit. Nothing too serious?

1538
01:38:39,250 --> 01:38:40,708
No, it’s the baby. A fever.

1539
01:38:41,208 --> 01:38:44,166
I’d rather be there in case it
gets worse. She’s home alone.

1540
01:38:44,250 --> 01:38:45,833
You should go home.
We’ll handle it.

1541
01:38:45,916 --> 01:38:48,351
I’ll be expecting you to file a
complete report in the morning

1542
01:38:48,375 --> 01:38:49,375
on this situation.

1543
01:38:49,416 --> 01:38:50,916
- Right.
- Good.

1544
01:38:52,166 --> 01:38:53,250
Go home to your kids.

1545
01:38:55,375 --> 01:38:56,375
Thanks.

1546

It’s getting messy.
I need your help.

1552
01:39:31,541 --> 01:39:32,750
<i>Where are you?</i>

1553
01:39:32,833 --> 01:39:34,166
I’ll send you the address.

1554
01:39:35,541 --> 01:39:37,583
[sniffing]

1555
01:39:42,625 --> 01:39:44,625
[breathing nervously]

1556
01:39:54,666 --> 01:39:56,791
- [closes door]
- [suspenseful music playing]

1557
01:40:13,458 --> 01:40:15,708
You always greet your
guests with a gun, Sami?

1558
01:40:16,458 --> 01:40:18,208
The fuck are you
doing in my house?

1559
01:40:19,375 --> 01:40:21,083
We can’t be seen together.

1560
01:40:21,166 --> 01:40:25,000
- They raided the 36, didn’t you hear?
- [Mahmoudi] No. Why don’t you fill us in?

1561
01:40:26,166 --> 01:40:28,642
- But put that thing on the ground first.
- Don’t give me orders.

1562
01:40:28,666 --> 01:40:30,866
- Who the fuck do you think you are?
- [Mahmoudi] Do it.

1563
01:40:32,875 --> 01:40:33,875
No problem.

1564
01:40:35,125 --> 01:40:38,541
- See? It’s down.
- Use your foot to push it away.

1565
01:40:39,125 --> 01:40:40,525
Like they teach
you at the Academy.

1566
01:40:43,166 --> 01:40:44,791
- [Sami] Satisfied?
- [Mahmoudi] Yeah.

1567
01:40:45,291 --> 01:40:47,171
Don’t be scared, honey.
Everything will be fine.

1568
01:40:47,208 --> 01:40:48,583
[Mahmoudi] We don’t know that.

1569
01:40:49,083 --> 01:40:50,208
[sniffs]

1570
01:40:50,291 --> 01:40:51,500
Where’re my kids?

1571
01:40:51,583 --> 01:40:52,875
Back in their beds.

1572
01:40:53,958 --> 01:40:55,250
Saïd sang them a lullaby.

1573
01:40:58,208 --> 01:41:00,875
[suspenseful music playing]

1574
01:41:04,708 --> 01:41:05,708
Karim.

1575
01:41:07,833 --> 01:41:09,393
You’re making a huge
mistake right now.

1576
01:41:11,416 --> 01:41:13,416
[suspenseful music intensifies]

1577
01:41:24,166 --> 01:41:25,875
You gonna tell me
what’s going on?

1578
01:41:27,333 --> 01:41:29,500
My old boss is the one
behind all this shit.

1579
01:41:30,541 --> 01:41:32,125
And Mahmoudi wants his revenge.

1580
01:41:33,750 --> 01:41:34,750
This is Sami’s house?

1581
01:41:34,791 --> 01:41:36,125
Yeah, right over there.

1582
01:41:36,833 --> 01:41:39,000
[Titus] Why didn’t you
call our actual boss?

1583
01:41:40,041 --> 01:41:41,881
Do you remember you’re
not supposed to be here?

1584
01:41:41,916 --> 01:41:43,791
And I shouldn’t be helping you.

1585
01:41:43,875 --> 01:41:45,458
You want your stripes, right?

1586
01:41:45,541 --> 01:41:47,791
I’m not a fan of
getting screwed over.

1587
01:41:47,875 --> 01:41:49,666
You fucked me like
a cheap whore.

1588
01:41:49,750 --> 01:41:52,541
Why don’t you start by telling me
what you did with my two million?

1589
01:41:52,625 --> 01:41:53,625
Karim.

1590
01:41:54,458 --> 01:41:56,208
This is all because
Richard lost his cool.

1591
01:41:56,291 --> 01:41:58,500
Okay? He got paranoid
and threatened to talk.

1592
01:41:59,083 --> 01:42:01,458
[Mahmoudi] It wasn’t
Richard! It was you!

1593
01:42:01,541 --> 01:42:04,291
- Tyson told me the whole story.
- [Sami] I was just doing my job.

1594
01:42:04,375 --> 01:42:06,375
[Mahmoudi] You call that
a job? Killing your team?

1595
01:42:06,958 --> 01:42:09,333
Fucking over your partners?
You son of a bitch!

1596
01:42:09,416 --> 01:42:11,958
[Sami] It was an
order! I swear to God!

1597
01:42:12,041 --> 01:42:13,500
I was just following orders!

1598
01:42:13,583 --> 01:42:16,000
We were just supposed to
steal the cash to start a war

1599
01:42:16,083 --> 01:42:18,958
between you and your competition!
Your nephew was an accident.

1600
01:42:19,041 --> 01:42:21,541
I swear on my children’s
lives, it was an accident!

1601
01:42:21,625 --> 01:42:23,250
You wanna see an accident?

1602
01:42:24,750 --> 01:42:26,250
[Vanessa screaming]

1603
01:42:26,333 --> 01:42:27,333
[grunts]

1604
01:42:28,833 --> 01:42:30,041
[grunts]

1605
01:42:32,208 --> 01:42:34,125
[screaming continues]

1606
01:42:34,208 --> 01:42:35,916
[suspenseful music continues]

1607
01:42:43,375 --> 01:42:44,375
[Vanessa screeches]

1608
01:42:46,458 --> 01:42:47,500
[explosion]

1609
01:42:47,583 --> 01:42:50,333
- [loud blasts]
- [glass shattering]

1610
01:42:50,916 --> 01:42:52,125
[Vanessa whimpering]

1611
01:42:54,500 --> 01:42:57,416
- [Mahmoudi] Stay where you are!
- [Vanessa shrieking]

1612
01:42:57,500 --> 01:42:58,500
Stay there!

1613
01:42:59,583 --> 01:43:02,125
- Shut the fuck up! Stay back!
- Let me go, you bastard!

1614
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:04,666
[suspenseful music intensifies]

1615
01:43:07,291 --> 01:43:08,791
[music stops abruptly]

1616
01:43:08,875 --> 01:43:10,208
[muffled screams]

1617
01:43:11,416 --> 01:43:13,791
[muffled gunfire]

1618
01:43:15,291 --> 01:43:16,583
[tense music playing]

1619
01:43:33,583 --> 01:43:35,750
- [broken glass crunching]
- [Sami groans]

1620
01:43:40,583 --> 01:43:41,833
Put it down, Sami.

1621
01:43:41,916 --> 01:43:43,708
[continues groaning]

1622
01:43:46,333 --> 01:43:47,833
Put it down, for fuck’s sake.

1623
01:43:51,875 --> 01:43:53,416
Don’t tell my kids about this.

1624
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:56,500
Put it down, please.

1625
01:43:58,750 --> 01:44:00,750
[tense music continues]

1626
01:44:27,625 --> 01:44:29,625
[birds squawking]

1627
01:44:37,291 --> 01:44:38,416
We’ve got you covered.

1628
01:44:39,083 --> 01:44:40,666
Your suspension never happened.

1629
01:44:40,750 --> 01:44:42,000
And I gave you the order.

1630
01:44:43,208 --> 01:44:44,208
What happens next?

1631
01:44:45,708 --> 01:44:47,166
You go back to work as usual.

1632
01:44:47,916 --> 01:44:49,541
You’ll get an overdue promotion.

1633
01:44:50,541 --> 01:44:52,166
And a medal for bravery to boot.

1634
01:44:53,500 --> 01:44:56,416
Belkaïm’s record will be wiped
clean and he’ll buried with honors

1635
01:44:56,500 --> 01:44:58,708
and Mahmoudi takes the
fall for everything.

1636
01:44:58,791 --> 01:44:59,791
[scoffs]

1637
01:44:59,875 --> 01:45:01,875
[tense music continues]

1638
01:45:03,208 --> 01:45:06,333
The fucking leader of a special
teams unit stealing from a drug lord…

1639
01:45:07,208 --> 01:45:10,250
who starts murdering his fellow cops
to get a bigger piece of the pie…

1640
01:45:10,750 --> 01:45:13,416
It might be a bit much for the
public to accept, don’t you think?

1641
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
This is a good thing.
We have a culprit.

1642
01:45:18,708 --> 01:45:19,708
Karim Mahmoudi.

1643
01:45:25,791 --> 01:45:26,875
It’s cut and dried.

1644
01:45:27,625 --> 01:45:30,083
Sami and his team had been
on his tail for months.

1645
01:45:31,833 --> 01:45:34,033
And they dismantled one of
his drug-trafficking networks

1646
01:45:34,083 --> 01:45:37,041
during an operation that caused the
unfortunate death of his nephew.

1647
01:45:38,541 --> 01:45:39,791
Mahmoudi wanted revenge.

1648
01:45:40,458 --> 01:45:43,375
So he started going after everyone
responsible for that boy’s death,

1649
01:45:43,458 --> 01:45:44,583
one by one.

1650
01:45:44,666 --> 01:45:45,958
Until he ended up here.

1651
01:45:46,750 --> 01:45:48,833
Where you and your
partner, Titus La Chapelle,

1652
01:45:48,916 --> 01:45:50,291
tried to avoid a bloodbath.

1653
01:45:51,291 --> 01:45:53,458
Which, unfortunately,
didn’t go our way.

1654
01:45:53,541 --> 01:45:56,208
In spite of the courage you
both clearly demonstrated.

1655
01:45:59,708 --> 01:46:01,541
The bad guys are
still the bad guys.

1656
01:46:02,666 --> 01:46:04,416
And we come up
smelling like roses.

1657
01:46:05,875 --> 01:46:07,208
So our morals don’t count?

1658
01:46:12,541 --> 01:46:14,666
Morality begins where
a cop’s work ends.

1659
01:46:19,750 --> 01:46:20,750
[music fades]

1660
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:23,833
Our decisions were
nothing personal.

1661
01:46:24,458 --> 01:46:27,708
I had to serve the interests of a
situation that was very complex.

1662
01:46:27,791 --> 01:46:29,125
Well above your pay grade.

1663
01:46:30,125 --> 01:46:31,125
Cerda…

1664
01:46:32,458 --> 01:46:33,958
I’m very sorry about all this.

1665
01:46:35,291 --> 01:46:37,625
What matters is that you
can get right back to work.

1666
01:46:38,333 --> 01:46:40,833
And that we managed to
wrap up this investigation,

1667
01:46:41,458 --> 01:46:43,708
and avoid a scandal for
our entire police force.

1668
01:46:46,458 --> 01:46:47,458
[sniffs]

1669
01:46:50,958 --> 01:46:52,125
[Antoine sighs]

1670
01:46:52,833 --> 01:46:54,458
[somber music playing]

1671
01:47:15,541 --> 01:47:16,833
[cellphone vibrates]

1672
01:47:16,916 --> 01:47:17,916
Hello?

1673
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,083
[Victor] <i>Victor Garnier.
You remember me?</i>

1674
01:47:20,666 --> 01:47:22,875
<i>You came to see me about
your buddy, Richard.</i>

1675
01:47:23,458 --> 01:47:26,041
<i>Come see me at the clinic.
I have something for you.</i>

1676
01:47:26,125 --> 01:47:27,125
[phone beeps]

1677
01:47:30,125 --> 01:47:32,791
[Victor] <i>Richard knew a whole
lot more than he let on.</i>

1678
01:47:33,833 --> 01:47:35,458
<i>That’s why he was scared.</i>

1679
01:47:35,541 --> 01:47:36,375
[sniffs]

1680
01:47:36,458 --> 01:47:39,875
Mahmoudi was just a two-bit player
compared to what you’ve got there.

1681
01:47:41,166 --> 01:47:42,541
When did you get all this?

1682
01:47:42,625 --> 01:47:43,875
Came in this morning.

1683
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:46,583
I assume he got it in the mail

1684
01:47:46,666 --> 01:47:49,041
before he went home to
off himself and his wife.

1685
01:47:49,833 --> 01:47:52,750
That’s not what really happened,
but I’ll tell you about that later.

1686
01:47:54,375 --> 01:47:55,666
So, who’s seen this?

1687
01:47:55,750 --> 01:47:57,000
Just the two of us.

1688
01:47:57,083 --> 01:47:58,916
I know I can’t trust the others.

1689
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:00,000
What others?

1690
01:48:01,166 --> 01:48:02,791
The ones who screwed you, son.

1691
01:48:04,041 --> 01:48:05,041
What did you think?

1692
01:48:05,500 --> 01:48:08,708
They'd let you get involved in
this mess just for the hell of it?

1693
01:48:08,791 --> 01:48:11,333
What they did was wait until
you’d stirred this shit up good,

1694
01:48:11,416 --> 01:48:12,791
then splattered it around enough

1695
01:48:12,875 --> 01:48:15,458
before coming in like the
cavalry to save the day.

1696
01:48:15,541 --> 01:48:17,416
And blaming all of
it on your buddy.

1697
01:48:18,833 --> 01:48:22,101
But what they didn’t take into account was
that Richard actually played by the rules

1698
01:48:22,125 --> 01:48:23,458
and took a bunch of notes.

1699
01:48:24,500 --> 01:48:26,750
He also kept copies of the
directives they were given

1700
01:48:26,833 --> 01:48:28,291
regarding all the dirty work.

1701
01:48:29,375 --> 01:48:32,708
But it doesn’t explain why Belkaïm
started picking his friends off.

1702
01:48:32,791 --> 01:48:34,500
[dramatic music playing]

1703
01:48:34,583 --> 01:48:35,833
Two million.

1704
01:48:35,916 --> 01:48:38,333
He offered to split the
money amongst themselves,

1705
01:48:38,416 --> 01:48:39,500
and they all refused.

1706
01:48:40,375 --> 01:48:42,000
So Belkaïm decided
to turn up the heat

1707
01:48:42,083 --> 01:48:44,666
by getting them to think
Mahmoudi knew what they’d done.

1708
01:48:45,916 --> 01:48:48,125
That’s what really sent
Richard over the edge

1709
01:48:48,208 --> 01:48:50,041
and made him wanna
reveal everything.

1710
01:48:54,333 --> 01:48:56,000
He wasn’t so scared of him.

1711
01:48:57,208 --> 01:48:59,916
It’s the whole Mocro-Maffia
connection they dug up.

1712
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,101
When Richard realized who
they were really up against,

1713
01:49:02,125 --> 01:49:03,958
that’s what triggered
his supposed paranoia.

1714
01:49:04,833 --> 01:49:06,750
And brought him here
to get some help.

1715
01:49:08,333 --> 01:49:09,333
So I guess…

1716
01:49:10,333 --> 01:49:12,291
he wasn’t talking
nonsense after all.

1717
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:15,708
And what happened
to the two million?

1718
01:49:19,083 --> 01:49:20,458
He skipped over that part.

1719
01:49:21,916 --> 01:49:24,083
I suppose your SI buddies
could answer that.

1720
01:49:24,166 --> 01:49:26,166

Based on what, Balestra?

01:51:01,041 --> 01:51:04,125
The ramblings of a cop suffering
from paranoia and depression?

1749
01:51:04,208 --> 01:51:06,375
Who blew his brains out
after killing his wife

1750
01:51:06,458 --> 01:51:08,291
when he escaped from
a psychiatric clinic?

1751
01:51:08,791 --> 01:51:11,083
No one’s going to
believe his delusions.

1752
01:51:11,166 --> 01:51:13,375
Especially since he’s
not here to share them.

1753
01:51:14,333 --> 01:51:15,666
Antoine says he has proof.

1754
01:51:17,791 --> 01:51:19,750
- What kind of proof?
- Personal records.

1755
01:51:20,500 --> 01:51:23,375
He says he has Richard’s detailed
records. The dates, times, places,

1756
01:51:23,458 --> 01:51:26,583
the code names of all the ops he was
involved with, with the SI program.

1757
01:51:27,083 --> 01:51:29,916
In my experience, a dead man’s
word is basically useless.

1758
01:51:31,666 --> 01:51:33,708
And as far as Captain Cerda,
you make him understand

1759
01:51:33,791 --> 01:51:36,458
that heroes don’t always
die on the field of battle.

1760
01:51:37,916 --> 01:51:40,250
Either he agrees to hand over
whatever Esteves gave to him

1761
01:51:40,333 --> 01:51:42,250
and forget everything
he saw in there,

1762
01:51:42,333 --> 01:51:45,000
or he goes the way of
his buddies and Belkaïm.

Why? Do you miss me already?

1771
01:52:25,791 --> 01:52:27,166
I think another week or so.

1772

01:52:51,458 --> 01:52:52,458
No.

1778
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:54,000
