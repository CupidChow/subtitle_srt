00:00:00,445 --> 00:00:01,545
(Eagle Brewery)

2
00:00:01,545 --> 00:00:03,545
(Episode 5)

3
00:00:11,254 --> 00:00:13,785
Goodness. It's being received well by customers.

4
00:00:13,785 --> 00:00:16,894
"Who knew makgeolli was this carbonated?"

5
00:00:16,894 --> 00:00:18,565
"It slips down the throat with ease."

6
00:00:18,565 --> 00:00:20,524
Those were just some of the compliments.

7
00:00:22,335 --> 00:00:23,594
What's the word from the kitchen staff?

8
00:00:23,594 --> 00:00:25,565
Jang-Kwang liquor...

9
00:00:25,565 --> 00:00:27,934
is bubbly and tangy,

10
00:00:27,934 --> 00:00:30,105
which pairs well with our food.

11
00:00:30,105 --> 00:00:31,974
Is that a stamp of approval?

12
00:00:31,974 --> 00:00:35,614
My gosh. It passed with flying colors.

13
00:00:35,614 --> 00:00:38,944
It's more flavorful than some champagnes.

14
00:00:40,715 --> 00:00:43,084
My dream is to make Jang-Kwang liquor...

15
00:00:43,614 --> 00:00:47,184
the Dal Perignon of makgeolli.

16
00:00:47,925 --> 00:00:50,194
Goodness me.

17
00:00:50,194 --> 00:00:52,925
You aim big, don't you?

18
00:00:54,425 --> 00:00:56,565
Gosh, the makgeolli is to die for.

19
00:00:56,934 --> 00:00:58,105
Thanks.

20
00:00:59,465 --> 00:01:00,934
After CEO Oh passed away,

21
00:01:00,934 --> 00:01:03,934
I thought this was the end for Eagle Makgeolli.

22
00:01:04,305 --> 00:01:05,904
How can you brew such fine drink...

23
00:01:05,904 --> 00:01:08,275
when you used to be a government employee?

24
00:01:08,615 --> 00:01:11,284
Jang Soo had done a great job,

25
00:01:11,745 --> 00:01:13,385
so taking over wasn't a hassle.

26
00:01:15,085 --> 00:01:18,654
It breaks my heart every time I think of CEO Oh.

27
00:01:19,184 --> 00:01:21,294
He was a decent man who never cut corners.

28
00:01:21,954 --> 00:01:23,755
What a shame.

29
00:01:28,135 --> 00:01:30,635
When will your new product be released?

30
00:01:33,064 --> 00:01:34,975
After we collect reviews,

31
00:01:34,975 --> 00:01:36,305
make adjustments,

32
00:01:36,305 --> 00:01:39,544
and wrap up the package and label design,

33
00:01:39,544 --> 00:01:40,975
the product will hit the market.

34
00:01:41,245 --> 00:01:43,814
I'll come to you first with our final product.

35
00:01:43,814 --> 00:01:46,844
Really? Call me excited.

36
00:01:48,885 --> 00:01:51,984
(Eagle Brewery)

37
00:01:52,255 --> 00:01:54,255
(Eagle Brewery)

38
00:01:57,924 --> 00:02:00,895
Yes? I'm super busy at the moment,

39
00:02:00,895 --> 00:02:02,634
so we'll talk later, Mom.

40
00:02:07,205 --> 00:02:08,974
I'm back!

41
00:02:09,874 --> 00:02:11,545
What did the restaurant say?

42
00:02:11,645 --> 00:02:13,844
The customers gave it rave reviews.

43
00:02:13,844 --> 00:02:16,414
The product will be a hit, and we'll be raking in money.

44
00:02:18,715 --> 00:02:20,314
Being hopelessly optimistic...

45
00:02:20,314 --> 00:02:22,754
is what you and the late boss have in common.

46
00:02:23,884 --> 00:02:25,825
They say a husband and wife are alike.

47
00:02:26,825 --> 00:02:28,854
The print shop called just now.

48
00:02:28,854 --> 00:02:30,955
The design of the package and the label was revised...

49
00:02:30,955 --> 00:02:32,365
and emailed to you.

50
00:02:32,465 --> 00:02:35,495
Okay. Everything is going as planned.

51
00:02:36,064 --> 00:02:38,004
The issue lies with the price.

52
00:02:38,465 --> 00:02:40,705
Makgeolli is what you enjoy for its affordability.

53
00:02:41,164 --> 00:02:44,675
Who'd buy and drink makgeolli that is over ten dollars a bottle?

54
00:02:45,075 --> 00:02:46,374
If consumers are satisfied,

55
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:48,444
they'll be willing to pay that price.

56
00:02:48,444 --> 00:02:52,344
It's about time we launched a premium makgeolli.

57
00:02:52,344 --> 00:02:55,115
It's not as easy as it sounds.

58
00:03:02,694 --> 00:03:03,724
Hey, Mom.

59
00:03:03,724 --> 00:03:05,724
If you're not here in less than a minute,

60
00:03:05,825 --> 00:03:08,034
I'll pack up and leave!

61
00:03:09,235 --> 00:03:10,265
Darn.

62
00:03:13,004 --> 00:03:14,705
Come on.

63
00:03:15,175 --> 00:03:18,645
Don't be like this and talk it out with me.

64
00:03:19,104 --> 00:03:20,944
What could've upset...

65
00:03:21,745 --> 00:03:24,015
the major shareholder of Eagle Brewery?

66
00:03:26,145 --> 00:03:27,684
You cow.

67
00:03:29,215 --> 00:03:31,154
I can't believe I had seaweed soup...

68
00:03:31,154 --> 00:03:33,485
after giving birth to a con artist like you.

69
00:03:35,594 --> 00:03:38,164
There's no need to be so harsh, Mom.

70
00:03:40,325 --> 00:03:41,895
What did you tell me when I moved in here?

71
00:03:41,895 --> 00:03:45,305
Didn't you say you'd care for me a thousand times better...

72
00:03:45,305 --> 00:03:46,765
than they did at Golden Castle?

73
00:03:47,335 --> 00:03:48,904
I was served a buffet three times a day...

74
00:03:48,904 --> 00:03:50,434
that was planned by nutritionists...

75
00:03:50,434 --> 00:03:52,844
while my room was cleaned and my clothes were ironed.

76
00:03:52,844 --> 00:03:56,015
Back there, I didn't have to lift a darn finger.

77
00:03:56,675 --> 00:03:58,715
Golf, swimming, yoga, and Pilates.

78
00:03:58,715 --> 00:04:00,615
I could do whatever I wanted...

79
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:01,854
and also enjoy other hobbies.

80
00:04:06,055 --> 00:04:08,124
I don't want to rain on your parade,

81
00:04:08,925 --> 00:04:11,424
but they won't take you back.

82
00:04:11,424 --> 00:04:14,395
The residents signed a petition, and you were about to be kicked out.

83
00:04:15,034 --> 00:04:16,135
What?

84
00:04:16,135 --> 00:04:18,635
They were chewing you out and even pulled your hair.

85
00:04:18,635 --> 00:04:21,265
The ladies there didn't make your life easy.

86
00:04:22,904 --> 00:04:25,375
One needs to be at ease mentally.

87
00:04:26,205 --> 00:04:29,744
Be patient with me, and you'll be living in luxury.

88
00:04:29,744 --> 00:04:30,844
When?

89
00:04:32,085 --> 00:04:33,984
Once our new product becomes a huge hit,

90
00:04:33,984 --> 00:04:36,455
I'll drop wads of cash in your arms.

91
00:04:36,455 --> 00:04:37,685
Wads of cash?

92
00:04:37,784 --> 00:04:40,054
We tested the new product,

93
00:04:40,054 --> 00:04:41,385
and we got a great response.

94
00:04:41,825 --> 00:04:43,955
They were gushing over it.

95
00:04:44,864 --> 00:04:45,994
Really?

96
00:04:46,525 --> 00:04:48,065
If this becomes a huge hit,

97
00:04:48,065 --> 00:04:49,835
I'll get you a place at Diamond Castle...

98
00:04:49,835 --> 00:04:51,604
instead of Golden Castle.

99
00:04:54,034 --> 00:04:55,775
So be patient with me,

100
00:04:55,904 --> 00:04:57,135
Ms. Major Shareholder.

101
00:04:57,804 --> 00:04:58,844
Can I trust you on this?

102
00:04:59,744 --> 00:05:01,515
Of course.

103
00:05:01,515 --> 00:05:04,275
I'm your daughter Ma Kwang Sook, remember?

104
00:05:11,525 --> 00:05:13,224
Be gentle with that.

105
00:05:19,164 --> 00:05:20,895
I thought I was seeing improvement...

106
00:05:21,965 --> 00:05:23,835
in your sleep pattern,

107
00:05:24,494 --> 00:05:25,705
but we're back to where we started.

108
00:05:28,104 --> 00:05:30,705
Did something happen to you recently?

109
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:31,744
Not at all.

110
00:05:32,174 --> 00:05:34,505
Of course. In your case,

111
00:05:34,505 --> 00:05:37,775
I'm worried about the lack of events in your life.

112
00:05:38,445 --> 00:05:39,715
I tweaked my back recently...

113
00:05:39,715 --> 00:05:41,484
and couldn't work out.

114
00:05:41,885 --> 00:05:43,815
You can say I deviated from my usual pattern.

115
00:05:44,185 --> 00:05:46,284
How did you tweak your back?

116
00:05:46,724 --> 00:05:48,494
I went to visit the children's mother when...

117
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:52,195
There was an incident.

118
00:05:52,395 --> 00:05:54,724
Do you still visit the columbarium...

119
00:05:54,724 --> 00:05:56,164
every week?

120
00:05:56,965 --> 00:05:58,135
Of course.

121
00:05:58,804 --> 00:06:03,005
It's been 15 years since your wife passed away.

122
00:06:03,534 --> 00:06:05,104
I'm impressed.

123
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:08,145
It's a rule I established.

124
00:06:10,315 --> 00:06:12,914
I was young back then...

125
00:06:13,784 --> 00:06:15,815
and was surrounded by many temptations.

126
00:06:15,815 --> 00:06:17,614
My mother was still alive,

127
00:06:17,614 --> 00:06:19,085
and she pressed me to remarry.

128
00:06:19,825 --> 00:06:22,825
I thought I'd waver and give in...

129
00:06:23,054 --> 00:06:24,424
if I didn't go see her every week.

130
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,664
That's why I made it a rule of mine,

131
00:06:28,494 --> 00:06:30,435
and I stood by it ever since.

132
00:06:32,505 --> 00:06:36,275
Rules are meant to be broken, Chairman Han.

133
00:06:36,804 --> 00:06:40,904
Promises and rules. Deviate from such restrictions.

134
00:06:41,005 --> 00:06:43,445
Your mind will be more at ease,

135
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:46,515
and you'll leave insomnia in the rearview mirror.

136
00:06:47,244 --> 00:06:48,955
Meet various people,

137
00:06:49,455 --> 00:06:51,755
listen to their life stories,

138
00:06:51,755 --> 00:06:53,424
and experience new things.

139
00:06:54,325 --> 00:06:57,625
You've lived your life like clockwork until now.

140
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:01,395
From now on, try to go easier on yourself.

141
00:07:01,734 --> 00:07:05,505
Insomnia? You will overcome it naturally.

142
00:07:12,275 --> 00:07:14,044
(Jang-Kwang Makgeolli)

143
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:23,784
I'm back.

144
00:07:24,984 --> 00:07:26,354
You're home, Chairman Han.

145
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:29,354
I didn't receive a call from your driver.

146
00:07:29,455 --> 00:07:31,154
His uncle passed away,

147
00:07:31,154 --> 00:07:33,565
so he took the day off and left for Busan in the morning.

148
00:07:33,565 --> 00:07:35,465
I had no idea.

149
00:07:35,994 --> 00:07:37,395
What about dinner?

150
00:07:37,565 --> 00:07:39,034
I ate with Dr. Park.

151
00:07:41,674 --> 00:07:43,034
(Jang-Kwang Makgeolli)

152
00:07:45,304 --> 00:07:49,414
You brought home some makgeolli a few months ago.

153
00:07:50,215 --> 00:07:52,614
It tasted so good that I became a fan.

154
00:07:53,715 --> 00:07:55,484
I keep it in the fridge and drink a cup...

155
00:07:55,685 --> 00:07:59,185
whenever I'm thirsty, and it's so refreshing.

156
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,695
I sleep better at night too.

157
00:08:04,924 --> 00:08:06,724
Keep it in the fridge.

158
00:08:07,765 --> 00:08:11,234
Nothing is better than makgeolli for those who do physical labor.

159
00:08:14,234 --> 00:08:15,904
Is it good enough to drink?

160
00:08:16,005 --> 00:08:17,404
Of course, it is.

161
00:08:18,505 --> 00:08:20,104
I'm a regular of sorts,

162
00:08:20,344 --> 00:08:22,844
so I got a few free bottles of their new product.

163
00:08:22,844 --> 00:08:25,215
It tasted way better...

164
00:08:25,844 --> 00:08:28,014
than the makgeolli you brought home.

165
00:08:30,585 --> 00:08:31,614
Where's Bom?

166
00:08:31,614 --> 00:08:33,685
She's been in her room all day.

167
00:08:34,285 --> 00:08:36,224
She barely eats.

168
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,854
She doesn't seem to feel well.

169
00:08:45,465 --> 00:08:46,465
Yes?

170
00:08:48,435 --> 00:08:49,604
You're home?

171
00:08:55,474 --> 00:08:57,374
What's wrong? Are you unwell?

172
00:08:57,844 --> 00:08:59,685
You were in here all day.

173
00:09:00,185 --> 00:09:01,815
I was coming down with something.

174
00:09:02,285 --> 00:09:04,215
I took a pill and rested, and I feel better now.

175
00:09:04,315 --> 00:09:06,024
You don't have to see a doctor?

176
00:09:07,425 --> 00:09:09,555
I must've exercised a bit too much lately.

177
00:09:09,624 --> 00:09:10,825
Don't worry.

178
00:09:13,165 --> 00:09:14,224
Goodness.

179
00:09:16,894 --> 00:09:18,905
Hey, how is Bom?

180
00:09:19,604 --> 00:09:22,075
I think her stalker scared her.

181
00:09:23,205 --> 00:09:25,205
She doesn't leave her home at all.

182
00:09:25,344 --> 00:09:27,104
The darn fool.

183
00:09:27,675 --> 00:09:30,675
What loser would threaten a girl who doesn't like him?

184
00:09:31,274 --> 00:09:32,514
How long were they together?

185
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:34,144
They weren't together.

186
00:09:34,614 --> 00:09:37,354
He's two years her senior, and he pursued her for two years.

187
00:09:38,085 --> 00:09:39,854
Whenever I think of what happened,

188
00:09:39,925 --> 00:09:41,224
I get chills.

189
00:09:42,224 --> 00:09:44,825
It could've been way worse if it hadn't been for the soldier.

190
00:09:45,224 --> 00:09:46,325
A soldier?

191
00:09:46,325 --> 00:09:48,195
He threatened Bom with a weapon...

192
00:09:48,195 --> 00:09:49,835
and tried to drag her to a car,

193
00:09:49,835 --> 00:09:52,264
but a passing soldier saw them and saved her.

194
00:09:52,535 --> 00:09:55,065
Chairman Han would've done something if he'd known.

195
00:09:55,634 --> 00:09:57,205
You can't tell him.

196
00:09:58,305 --> 00:10:01,175
He's sensitive and gruff.

197
00:10:01,405 --> 00:10:03,844
He'd foam at the mouth if he heard.

198
00:10:05,285 --> 00:10:08,185
Se Ri. Did you talk to Gyeol today?

199
00:10:09,185 --> 00:10:10,215
Not yet.

200
00:10:14,185 --> 00:10:17,624
Ever since then, Gyeol has been calling her...

201
00:10:17,624 --> 00:10:19,724
every day without fail.

202
00:10:23,795 --> 00:10:25,935
Let's pick a date once he's discharged.

203
00:10:27,134 --> 00:10:28,165
What date?

204
00:10:28,165 --> 00:10:30,104
A date for the wedding.

205
00:10:30,874 --> 00:10:31,974
What are you on about?

206
00:10:32,344 --> 00:10:33,405
Don't be silly.

207
00:10:36,675 --> 00:10:38,685
You asked if I was that desperate...

208
00:10:38,685 --> 00:10:40,344
to marry off my only child.

209
00:10:40,344 --> 00:10:42,455
You're a bit worse than me.

210
00:10:42,455 --> 00:10:44,955
Why waste time if they like each other?

211
00:10:45,085 --> 00:10:46,524
Everything's a pass.

212
00:10:50,055 --> 00:10:51,455
I enjoyed that.

213
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:56,195
I knew Gyeol would be my future son-in-law...

214
00:10:56,195 --> 00:10:58,465
ever since I saw him in kindergarten.

215
00:10:59,065 --> 00:11:00,104
Mom.

216
00:11:00,104 --> 00:11:03,604
Do you know how much effort I put into befriending his mom?

217
00:11:04,004 --> 00:11:06,045
I pushed aside my self-esteem...

218
00:11:06,045 --> 00:11:07,774
and tried to brownnose her.

219
00:11:07,774 --> 00:11:10,344
I groveled and willingly helped her like an assistant...

220
00:11:10,445 --> 00:11:12,244
to stay on her good side.

221
00:11:17,555 --> 00:11:18,585
My goodness.

222
00:11:18,984 --> 00:11:20,555
You two are the ones dating,

223
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:23,624
so why does my heart beat out of my chest?

224
00:11:24,195 --> 00:11:25,394
Pick up quick.

225
00:11:27,524 --> 00:11:28,535
"Gyeol."

226
00:11:29,165 --> 00:11:30,364
Hi, Gyeol.

227
00:11:30,634 --> 00:11:31,665
Did you have dinner?

228
00:11:31,935 --> 00:11:33,465
I'm eating right now.

229
00:11:34,905 --> 00:11:37,175
I hear loud music. Are you outdoors?

230
00:11:37,335 --> 00:11:39,374
I'm meeting Oh Kang Soo for a beer.

231
00:11:39,474 --> 00:11:40,604
I'm at a beer joint nearby.

232
00:11:41,205 --> 00:11:43,175
The soldier who saved Bom?

233
00:11:43,344 --> 00:11:44,374
Yes.

234
00:11:44,545 --> 00:11:47,614
We've been meeting up every now and then for a beer.

235
00:11:48,045 --> 00:11:49,715
I see.

236
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,724
Hey, he's here.

237
00:11:55,854 --> 00:11:57,325
Enjoy your meal and sleep well.

238
00:11:57,494 --> 00:11:58,494
I'll call again.

239
00:11:59,965 --> 00:12:01,624
- Victory. - Just sit down.

240
00:12:04,465 --> 00:12:06,004
How's the wound?

241
00:12:06,134 --> 00:12:07,134
Oh, this?

242
00:12:07,634 --> 00:12:09,474
I did as you said.

243
00:12:09,474 --> 00:12:11,234
I cleaned and dressed it every day.

244
00:12:11,234 --> 00:12:12,675
It's healed, and there's no scar.

245
00:12:12,905 --> 00:12:15,915
Good. I was worried it might cause nerve damage.

246
00:12:16,774 --> 00:12:19,244
Thanks again for saving my sister.

247
00:12:20,215 --> 00:12:23,155
I did what I should have as a soldier.

248
00:12:24,354 --> 00:12:26,124
How is your sister these days?

249
00:12:26,124 --> 00:12:28,854
She doesn't let it show because she's thoughtful and mature,

250
00:12:29,594 --> 00:12:30,695
but she must've been shocked.

251
00:12:32,124 --> 00:12:34,094
She wanted to thank you.

252
00:12:34,224 --> 00:12:36,494
I'll call her so you two can talk.

253
00:12:37,894 --> 00:12:39,165
No, it's fine.

254
00:12:39,465 --> 00:12:40,565
It's really fine.

255
00:12:43,175 --> 00:12:44,175
See,

256
00:12:44,835 --> 00:12:47,244
I grew up in a house full of guys.

257
00:12:48,504 --> 00:12:51,445
I'm too embarrassed to talk to a woman.

258
00:12:52,384 --> 00:12:55,114
Then how did you date so far?

259
00:12:57,415 --> 00:13:00,055
You've never dated in your life?

260
00:13:01,585 --> 00:13:02,594
I have.

261
00:13:03,124 --> 00:13:05,425
No way. That's impossible. No.

262
00:13:05,425 --> 00:13:06,965
I have dated before.

263
00:13:07,465 --> 00:13:09,565
- No way... - Here are your beers.

264
00:13:10,795 --> 00:13:12,035
Lieutenant Oh.

265
00:13:13,435 --> 00:13:15,575
Did you just drink before we clinked glasses?

266
00:13:16,675 --> 00:13:18,805
I apologize. I was distracted...

267
00:13:22,114 --> 00:13:23,114
I was kidding.

268
00:13:23,715 --> 00:13:24,744
Cheers.

269
00:13:25,415 --> 00:13:26,445
Cheers.

270
00:13:46,335 --> 00:13:48,004
(From Oh Jang Soo, To Oh Beom Soo)

271
00:13:57,744 --> 00:13:59,915
To my dear brother Beom Soo.

272
00:14:00,945 --> 00:14:02,455
I hope this finds you well.

273
00:14:03,114 --> 00:14:06,254
Forgive me for sending you far away to study...

274
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:07,955
and failing to help out.

275
00:14:08,655 --> 00:14:10,254
I haven't studied that much,

276
00:14:10,425 --> 00:14:12,894
so I can't exactly grasp how hard it is...

277
00:14:13,124 --> 00:14:16,094
for you to study abroad in a foreign language.

278
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:19,764
But you're clever and hardworking,

279
00:14:20,165 --> 00:14:23,504
and I have no doubts you'll do better than anyone.

280
00:14:24,335 --> 00:14:25,405
Jang Soo.

281
00:14:26,545 --> 00:14:28,004
Your studies are important,

282
00:14:28,504 --> 00:14:30,545
but don't forget your health comes first.

283
00:14:31,644 --> 00:14:33,844
Always eat well and on time.

284
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:37,655
I look forward to the day all five of us are together again...

285
00:14:38,114 --> 00:14:40,024
as I conclude this letter.

286
00:14:42,455 --> 00:14:43,724
I'm sorry, Jang Soo.

287
00:14:46,264 --> 00:14:47,465
I'm sorry.

288
00:14:54,465 --> 00:14:55,504
Ha Ni.

289
00:14:56,274 --> 00:14:58,575
Are you crying because Dad cried?

290
00:15:00,244 --> 00:15:01,945
Dad won't cry anymore.

291
00:15:02,075 --> 00:15:03,614
Go to sleep.

292
00:15:05,685 --> 00:15:06,715
Good girl.

293
00:15:07,945 --> 00:15:09,254
Sleep tight.

294
00:15:12,325 --> 00:15:14,585
Go to sleep.

295
00:15:17,494 --> 00:15:20,894
(Dancing Prince)

296
00:15:28,665 --> 00:15:30,504
It's been a long time.

297
00:15:30,504 --> 00:15:31,835
How have you been?

298
00:15:32,205 --> 00:15:34,274
Your Dancing Prince says hi.

299
00:15:35,715 --> 00:15:37,915
I haven't streamed for a while...

300
00:15:38,344 --> 00:15:40,014
because I had a few personal struggles.

301
00:15:40,514 --> 00:15:43,285
I pulled myself together to come back.

302
00:15:43,655 --> 00:15:46,955
Cinderella's Sister, Mozzarella, welcome.

303
00:15:47,325 --> 00:15:50,354
Woogi, Morning Glory, long time no see. Nice to see you.

304
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:53,724
Instead of talking about dancing,

305
00:15:53,724 --> 00:15:55,665
I'll have some makgeolli...

306
00:15:55,665 --> 00:15:58,134
and chat with you about this and that.

307
00:16:00,705 --> 00:16:03,705
Rose Scissors became a member...

308
00:16:03,705 --> 00:16:05,844
and donated 100 dollars too?

309
00:16:07,604 --> 00:16:09,445
I don't recognize your ID.

310
00:16:09,545 --> 00:16:11,915
Thanks so much for your support.

311
00:16:12,585 --> 00:16:14,514
Just as I said that,

312
00:16:14,514 --> 00:16:16,455
Rose Scissors said,

313
00:16:16,555 --> 00:16:19,425
"I'm always watching you," and donated another 100 dollars!

314
00:16:19,724 --> 00:16:21,825
My gosh. Thank you.

315
00:16:22,195 --> 00:16:23,295
Oh, my gosh!

316
00:16:23,695 --> 00:16:25,024
Another 100 dollars!

317
00:16:25,494 --> 00:16:28,795
Rose Scissors made three donations in a row.

318
00:16:29,065 --> 00:16:30,094
Goodness.

319
00:16:30,594 --> 00:16:34,134
This is the first time anyone's made such a huge donation on my stream.

320
00:16:34,805 --> 00:16:36,504
Thanks a lot, Rose Scissors.

321
00:16:36,504 --> 00:16:37,575
(Oh Heung Soo's back.)

322
00:16:37,575 --> 00:16:39,175
You made a strong first impression.

323
00:16:39,175 --> 00:16:41,144
I hope you'll attend our get-together.

324
00:16:41,675 --> 00:16:43,315
I'd love to meet you.

325
00:16:44,215 --> 00:16:45,244
Thank you.

326
00:16:46,945 --> 00:16:48,014
Cheers.

327
00:16:49,955 --> 00:16:51,715
I haven't been able to reach you for days.

328
00:16:51,984 --> 00:16:53,285
What are you up to?

329
00:16:53,955 --> 00:16:55,655
Do you know how worried I was all day?

330
00:16:56,195 --> 00:16:58,865
I was going to call the police if I couldn't reach Yeoung Ju.

331
00:17:02,564 --> 00:17:04,165
Call me as soon as you get this message.

332
00:17:05,635 --> 00:17:06,665
I'll be waiting.

333
00:17:25,215 --> 00:17:26,724
Hello, Ms. Gong.

334
00:17:26,984 --> 00:17:28,484
I still can't believe...

335
00:17:29,494 --> 00:17:31,294
my only daughter was widowed...

336
00:17:31,294 --> 00:17:33,125
ten days after her wedding.

337
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:34,564
Now she's making rice wine...

338
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:36,965
as if she's possessed by a drunk ghost.

339
00:17:37,834 --> 00:17:39,465
Put yourself in my shoes.

340
00:17:39,834 --> 00:17:41,764
How would you be if you were me?

341
00:17:42,705 --> 00:17:43,935
I'm sorry, ma'am.

342
00:17:44,334 --> 00:17:47,544
Not only did she scrape together all the money she had,

343
00:17:47,544 --> 00:17:50,945
but she took out every bank loan she could for the brewery.

344
00:17:53,385 --> 00:17:55,044
What if the new product fails?

345
00:17:55,754 --> 00:17:58,014
My daughter and I will be forced out onto the streets.

346
00:17:58,215 --> 00:17:59,455
It should go well.

347
00:18:00,885 --> 00:18:02,324
It will be successful, Ms. Gong.

348
00:18:02,994 --> 00:18:04,695
You're just saying that because it's not your money.

349
00:18:05,155 --> 00:18:06,965
I'm not just saying it.

350
00:18:06,965 --> 00:18:09,834
She's so sure that the new product will be a success,

351
00:18:10,834 --> 00:18:12,635
but this isn't just right.

352
00:18:12,834 --> 00:18:15,435
I know it's a little late, but I want you to stop my daughter.

353
00:18:17,234 --> 00:18:18,635
Who are you talking to?

354
00:18:18,774 --> 00:18:21,205
I was so frustrated that I called your brother-in-law. Any problem?

355
00:18:21,744 --> 00:18:22,875
I can't believe this.

356
00:18:24,314 --> 00:18:25,915
Let go!

357
00:18:26,185 --> 00:18:27,185
Hello?

358
00:18:27,415 --> 00:18:28,584
It's me, Kwang Sook.

359
00:18:28,984 --> 00:18:30,415
I'm sorry, Chun Soo.

360
00:18:30,885 --> 00:18:33,385
I'll make sure she never calls you again.

361
00:18:33,385 --> 00:18:34,584
I will call him if I want to!

362
00:18:34,584 --> 00:18:37,095
Do I need your permission to call him? My gosh...

363
00:18:38,095 --> 00:18:40,064
I'll call you later. I'm hanging up.

364
00:18:41,224 --> 00:18:43,534
You're driving me crazy.

365
00:18:43,695 --> 00:18:44,695
What?

366
00:18:44,695 --> 00:18:46,534
He's already having a hard time after losing his job.

367
00:18:46,534 --> 00:18:48,165
Why would you call him?

368
00:18:48,504 --> 00:18:51,074
I feel really bad for Chun Soo.

369
00:18:52,034 --> 00:18:53,445
Don't you feel bad for your mom?

370
00:18:55,074 --> 00:18:56,675
How do you think I'm feeling looking at my daughter...

371
00:18:56,675 --> 00:18:58,274
who became a widow after only ten days of marriage?

372
00:18:59,284 --> 00:19:01,784
When you are so considerate of others,

373
00:19:02,215 --> 00:19:04,984
why won't you care about my feelings at all?

374
00:19:06,554 --> 00:19:07,685
What about me?

375
00:19:09,095 --> 00:19:12,095
How do you think I'm feeling after losing my husband in ten days?

376
00:19:14,494 --> 00:19:17,534
I feel like I'm standing in front of a cliff...

377
00:19:17,534 --> 00:19:20,405
with my eyes covered and my hands and feet tied.

378
00:19:21,334 --> 00:19:23,474
I pretend to be fine,

379
00:19:24,774 --> 00:19:28,175
but I don't even know how I'm going to live.

380
00:19:29,175 --> 00:19:32,274
Why are you taking over the brewery when you're feeling like that?

381
00:19:32,274 --> 00:19:33,984
Why is that?

382
00:19:36,484 --> 00:19:38,814
I have to do that at least to be able to breathe.

383
00:19:40,685 --> 00:19:41,754
What?

384
00:19:42,494 --> 00:19:44,355
When I smell makgeolli,

385
00:19:45,254 --> 00:19:47,794
I feel like Jang Soo is with me.

386
00:19:49,135 --> 00:19:51,764
That's what makes me breathe.

387
00:19:53,705 --> 00:19:55,905
I feel like I can live on.

388
00:19:57,635 --> 00:19:59,605
Can't you see how I'm feeling?

389
00:20:01,345 --> 00:20:03,314
No. You're just crazy.

390
00:20:03,574 --> 00:20:05,215
Of course, I am.

391
00:20:06,415 --> 00:20:09,314
If you were me, would you be able to live in your right mind?

392
00:20:10,155 --> 00:20:11,514
Fine, you brat.

393
00:20:12,584 --> 00:20:14,385
Just spend your whole life...

394
00:20:15,224 --> 00:20:18,224
brewing liquor like someone possessed by a drunken ghost.

395
00:20:18,224 --> 00:20:19,294
Happy now?

396
00:20:20,724 --> 00:20:23,564
You feel like you can breathe only when you smell makgeolli.

397
00:20:23,734 --> 00:20:25,734
What can I do about it?

398
00:20:26,205 --> 00:20:29,905
I can't let my only daughter die.

399
00:20:40,685 --> 00:20:42,084
Thank you, Mom.

400
00:20:44,385 --> 00:20:48,125
I'm not sure if this is something you should thank me for.

401
00:20:49,595 --> 00:20:51,955
I'm grateful that you believe in me.

402
00:20:53,524 --> 00:20:55,195
Now that you're going to believe me,

403
00:20:56,064 --> 00:20:57,564
just trust me a little more.

404
00:20:58,564 --> 00:21:00,764
I will never disappoint you.

405
00:21:04,774 --> 00:21:06,445
I'll make Eagle Brewery...

406
00:21:06,804 --> 00:21:09,215
the best brewery in the country...

407
00:21:10,044 --> 00:21:13,044
and let you live in comfort.

408
00:21:15,915 --> 00:21:17,855
You trust me, right?

409
00:21:22,824 --> 00:21:24,254
Okay.

410
00:22:41,623 --> 00:22:43,383
(Jang-Kwang Makgeolli)

411
00:22:47,593 --> 00:22:50,123
(Jang-Kwang Makgeolli)

412
00:23:10,313 --> 00:23:11,653
Oh, no. What's happening?

413
00:23:18,994 --> 00:23:20,623
My goodness.

414
00:23:26,133 --> 00:23:27,863
Gosh, what do I do?

415
00:23:28,804 --> 00:23:30,304
Darn it!

416
00:23:33,633 --> 00:23:35,004
Oh, dear.

417
00:23:50,923 --> 00:23:53,554
I just wanted to have a drink to get some sleep,

418
00:23:53,554 --> 00:23:55,623
but I ended up making a mess.

419
00:23:56,663 --> 00:23:59,494
Gosh, it stinks.

420
00:24:16,014 --> 00:24:17,083
My goodness.

421
00:24:18,214 --> 00:24:20,954
The bubbles look great.

422
00:24:39,034 --> 00:24:40,133
What's with this?

423
00:24:41,403 --> 00:24:43,274
How does makgeolli taste this good?

424
00:24:43,504 --> 00:24:45,873
(Jang-Kwang Makgeolli)

425
00:24:45,873 --> 00:24:47,913
Gosh, this is completely new.

426
00:25:03,224 --> 00:25:04,294
What?

427
00:25:15,744 --> 00:25:16,804
Good.

428
00:25:48,173 --> 00:25:49,873
Gosh, what time is it?

429
00:26:03,153 --> 00:26:06,694
Did I sleep through the entire night?

430
00:26:13,734 --> 00:26:16,333
How very strange.

431
00:26:17,163 --> 00:26:19,133
I'm sure I had a bottle left.

432
00:26:20,434 --> 00:26:21,444
What are you looking for?

433
00:26:21,444 --> 00:26:23,544
Hey. I'm looking for makgeolli.

434
00:26:24,244 --> 00:26:26,173
I think I had one bottle left in the fridge.

435
00:26:26,313 --> 00:26:27,944
You didn't drink it, did you?

436
00:26:27,944 --> 00:26:29,184
No.

437
00:26:29,343 --> 00:26:30,643
This is strange.

438
00:26:33,284 --> 00:26:34,613
Did you sleep well?

439
00:26:34,613 --> 00:26:37,454
Yes. I slept well for the first time in a while.

440
00:26:38,923 --> 00:26:40,853
Why? Is something wrong?

441
00:26:41,694 --> 00:26:44,224
I came to the kitchen this morning...

442
00:26:44,224 --> 00:26:47,093
to find it smelling of makgeolli.

443
00:26:48,264 --> 00:26:51,534
It gave me the wrong idea, and I checked the fridge.

444
00:26:52,034 --> 00:26:53,274
There was a bottle of makgeolli left,

445
00:26:53,274 --> 00:26:54,734
but now it's gone.

446
00:26:55,173 --> 00:26:58,143
It's not like a burglar would break in just to steal that.

447
00:26:58,514 --> 00:27:00,014
How odd.

448
00:27:03,643 --> 00:27:05,313
I drank it.

449
00:27:07,454 --> 00:27:08,853
You, sir?

450
00:27:09,423 --> 00:27:10,554
You, Dad?

451
00:27:12,923 --> 00:27:13,954
Yes.

452
00:27:24,034 --> 00:27:25,073
Boss.

453
00:27:28,643 --> 00:27:29,804
The sample arrived.

454
00:27:30,343 --> 00:27:31,373
Already?

455
00:27:36,143 --> 00:27:37,244
(Jang-Kwang Makgeolli)

456
00:27:37,244 --> 00:27:38,313
Is it...

457
00:27:39,353 --> 00:27:40,413
a little tacky?

458
00:27:40,853 --> 00:27:42,184
If you think it's tacky,

459
00:27:42,184 --> 00:27:44,083
imagine what I'd think when I'm decades younger.

460
00:27:44,423 --> 00:27:45,853
Other brands might sell makgeolli...

461
00:27:45,954 --> 00:27:48,024
with bad taste, but the packaging is sophisticated.

462
00:27:48,024 --> 00:27:49,264
Sophisticated, my foot.

463
00:27:51,194 --> 00:27:52,764
Makgeolli...

464
00:27:53,794 --> 00:27:55,804
should be rustic and approachable.

465
00:27:56,833 --> 00:27:59,304
This is excellent, Boss. It looks great.

466
00:28:01,804 --> 00:28:03,403
I'll be generous and give it a C-plus.

467
00:28:03,544 --> 00:28:05,073
Don't jinx it, will you?

468
00:28:07,873 --> 00:28:09,643
To promote the product,

469
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:12,184
deliveries should be made to our partners.

470
00:28:14,214 --> 00:28:16,054
There's something we must do first.

471
00:28:33,103 --> 00:28:34,474
Darn, why isn't this working?

472
00:28:38,004 --> 00:28:39,113
How can I help you?

473
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:40,913
I'm the newly appointed Oh Beom Soo.

474
00:28:40,913 --> 00:28:42,284
Am I at the right office?

475
00:28:43,244 --> 00:28:45,554
Goodness. It's a pleasure to meet you.

476
00:28:45,554 --> 00:28:47,153
I'm teaching assistant Lee Seon Mi.

477
00:28:47,754 --> 00:28:50,484
I heard you were coming, so I was waiting for you.

478
00:28:51,754 --> 00:28:53,794
I have boxes to unload, so I'll head to my office first.

479
00:28:54,093 --> 00:28:55,764
Sure. Let me carry that.

480
00:28:55,764 --> 00:28:56,764
It's fine.

481
00:28:57,163 --> 00:28:58,794
These are my belongings and aren't that heavy.

482
00:28:59,994 --> 00:29:00,994
Okay.

483
00:29:03,163 --> 00:29:04,403
It's this way, Professor.

484
00:29:05,534 --> 00:29:06,774
Don't you need this?

485
00:29:07,073 --> 00:29:08,573
You can return it once you're done.

486
00:29:11,103 --> 00:29:12,113
This is your office.

487
00:29:14,843 --> 00:29:16,843
(Oh Beom Soo, Out of office)

488
00:29:17,284 --> 00:29:19,383
You can change the lock code later.

489
00:29:19,954 --> 00:29:20,954
Sure.

490
00:29:30,363 --> 00:29:33,034
You wanted a table rather than a couch,

491
00:29:33,034 --> 00:29:34,694
which is what I requested.

492
00:29:35,534 --> 00:29:36,663
Do you like it?

493
00:29:37,434 --> 00:29:38,573
Yes, I do.

494
00:29:38,804 --> 00:29:40,704
I'll be at the main office,

495
00:29:40,704 --> 00:29:43,004
so let me know if you need anything.

496
00:29:43,274 --> 00:29:44,304
Thank you.

497
00:29:44,403 --> 00:29:46,613
Don't mind me and go about your work.

498
00:29:46,974 --> 00:29:48,044
Okay.

499
00:30:12,704 --> 00:30:14,434
I made it this far thanks to you.

500
00:30:15,304 --> 00:30:16,373
Thank you.

501
00:30:17,274 --> 00:30:18,343
And...

502
00:30:20,014 --> 00:30:21,044
I'm sorry.

503
00:30:35,563 --> 00:30:37,294
It's been a while, ma'am.

504
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:38,934
Where's the chairman?

505
00:30:39,363 --> 00:30:41,934
Buyers from Japan are visiting, and he's in a meeting with them.

506
00:30:42,004 --> 00:30:43,304
He's almost done though.

507
00:30:45,304 --> 00:30:46,704
I'm not here to see him.

508
00:30:46,934 --> 00:30:49,843
It's to have you confirm something.

509
00:30:51,143 --> 00:30:52,974
Me, ma'am?

510
00:30:54,113 --> 00:30:55,184
Thank you.

511
00:30:56,944 --> 00:30:57,944
Go ahead.

512
00:31:06,724 --> 00:31:09,163
What did you want to talk about?

513
00:31:10,194 --> 00:31:11,964
It's about Eagle Brewery.

514
00:31:12,333 --> 00:31:14,363
Is it true that the company won't be taking over?

515
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:15,833
Sorry?

516
00:31:16,764 --> 00:31:18,204
Yes, you heard right.

517
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:23,544
The takeover was evaluated from different angles,

518
00:31:24,204 --> 00:31:25,744
but it was scrapped...

519
00:31:26,214 --> 00:31:27,573
by the chairman's order.

520
00:31:28,214 --> 00:31:29,444
Are you sure?

521
00:31:29,913 --> 00:31:31,613
There's a way for me to find out.

522
00:31:31,684 --> 00:31:34,313
Why would I lie to you, ma'am?

523
00:31:36,024 --> 00:31:37,054
All right.

524
00:31:37,583 --> 00:31:38,623
Also,

525
00:31:40,623 --> 00:31:42,264
what we talked about...

526
00:31:42,593 --> 00:31:44,823
doesn't have to reach the chairman's ears.

527
00:31:45,563 --> 00:31:48,194
I'm sure you know what I mean.

528
00:31:49,234 --> 00:31:51,464
Yes, of course.

529
00:31:53,873 --> 00:31:55,673
What on earth?

530
00:31:57,474 --> 00:31:58,774
What brings you by unannounced?

531
00:31:59,244 --> 00:32:02,083
Do you even have to ask? I missed you, that's all.

532
00:32:02,444 --> 00:32:03,984
What's gotten into you?

533
00:32:04,544 --> 00:32:06,754
Goodness, you have no romantic side.

534
00:32:07,014 --> 00:32:08,853
I'll excuse myself then.

535
00:32:14,054 --> 00:32:15,294
What is it?

536
00:32:16,194 --> 00:32:17,294
Is something up?

537
00:32:17,593 --> 00:32:19,034
Nothing's up.

538
00:32:19,434 --> 00:32:21,133
I was meeting someone nearby...

539
00:32:21,133 --> 00:32:23,964
and came by the office to have some tea with you.

540
00:32:23,964 --> 00:32:26,173
Why would you do that when this isn't a coffee shop?

541
00:32:26,173 --> 00:32:27,173
What?

542
00:32:27,173 --> 00:32:29,504
Don't come by the office for no reason like this.

543
00:32:29,504 --> 00:32:31,603
You're inconveniencing the employees.

544
00:32:31,843 --> 00:32:33,673
Okay, fine.

545
00:32:34,014 --> 00:32:36,113
I'll finish my coffee and leave.

546
00:32:36,113 --> 00:32:37,383
Gulp it all down and go.

547
00:32:38,184 --> 00:32:40,853
How could I gulp it down? This isn't some makgeolli.

548
00:32:47,254 --> 00:32:48,393
Drink it slowly, then.

549
00:32:52,363 --> 00:32:53,893
I'm in the parking lot.

550
00:32:54,494 --> 00:32:55,704
I'm stopping by the university office...

551
00:32:55,704 --> 00:32:56,903
before heading home.

552
00:32:58,304 --> 00:33:00,304
I thought you'd be having dinner with Dad today.

553
00:33:02,043 --> 00:33:04,443
Shopping? Sounds good.

554
00:33:05,043 --> 00:33:06,073
All right.

555
00:33:06,374 --> 00:33:08,514
I'll head to the department store once I'm done here.

556
00:33:09,814 --> 00:33:10,883
Sure.

557
00:33:12,914 --> 00:33:14,213
Hey, Seon Mi.

558
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:17,883
- Hi. - Se Ri, I'm glad I ran into you.

559
00:33:18,284 --> 00:33:20,823
Can you watch the office while I visit the main building?

560
00:33:21,023 --> 00:33:22,124
Are you free?

561
00:33:22,164 --> 00:33:24,323
- Yes, of course. - Thank you.

562
00:33:25,963 --> 00:33:27,064
By the way,

563
00:33:27,064 --> 00:33:28,093
the administration office...

564
00:33:28,093 --> 00:33:30,003
is sending someone over to fix the copy machine.

565
00:33:30,003 --> 00:33:31,034
Have it done.

566
00:33:31,164 --> 00:33:33,304
- Sure. Trust me to handle it. - Thanks.

567
00:33:46,014 --> 00:33:48,414
Hey, Mom. I'm still at the university.

568
00:33:48,684 --> 00:33:50,323
The teaching assistant went to the main building,

569
00:33:50,423 --> 00:33:51,923
and I'm watching the office for her.

570
00:33:52,554 --> 00:33:54,293
What about you? Are you at the department store?

571
00:33:55,764 --> 00:33:56,923
Hold on a second.

572
00:33:58,064 --> 00:33:59,363
How can I help you?

573
00:34:01,034 --> 00:34:02,604
Where's the copy machine?

574
00:34:03,034 --> 00:34:04,564
Over there.

575
00:34:10,403 --> 00:34:12,443
It turns on but doesn't work.

576
00:34:12,443 --> 00:34:13,613
Please get it running.

577
00:34:14,613 --> 00:34:15,644
Me?

578
00:34:17,443 --> 00:34:19,514
You should fix it. Who else?

579
00:34:22,323 --> 00:34:23,354
Hey, Mom.

580
00:34:23,383 --> 00:34:24,854
I thought you hung up.

581
00:34:24,954 --> 00:34:26,023
I should fix it?

582
00:34:26,023 --> 00:34:28,054
The copier's out of order.

583
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:29,624
A guy came to fix it.

584
00:34:31,293 --> 00:34:35,093
Mom, I heard a great pasta place opened on the eighth floor.

585
00:34:35,093 --> 00:34:36,204
How about we go there for dinner?

586
00:34:39,003 --> 00:34:40,173
That reminds me, Mom.

587
00:34:40,173 --> 00:34:42,903
Do you remember In Kyung who I sat with in 12th grade?

588
00:34:44,144 --> 00:34:45,773
I ran into her earlier,

589
00:34:45,914 --> 00:34:47,713
and she looked completely different after her plastic surgery.

590
00:34:47,773 --> 00:34:50,613
Mom, what if I had a simple nose job?

591
00:34:50,613 --> 00:34:52,483
Is she a little kid or what?

592
00:34:52,483 --> 00:34:54,153
- Mom this and Mom that. - Got it.

593
00:34:54,314 --> 00:34:56,054
I'll be there soon. Sure.

594
00:35:00,454 --> 00:35:01,793
Are you done fixing it?

595
00:35:03,423 --> 00:35:06,064
I'm not sure. I don't know what the problem is.

596
00:35:06,633 --> 00:35:08,463
Isn't it your job to figure that out, mister?

597
00:35:14,804 --> 00:35:16,244
Are you a business major?

598
00:35:18,043 --> 00:35:19,914
I am. Why do you ask?

599
00:35:23,184 --> 00:35:24,943
Maybe it ran out of toner.

600
00:35:36,764 --> 00:35:39,034
Gosh, I'm so sorry. Hang on...

601
00:35:39,233 --> 00:35:41,363
I'm wearing this dress for the first time.

602
00:35:42,334 --> 00:35:44,564
- Oh, no. - I'll pay for the dry cleaning.

603
00:35:44,733 --> 00:35:45,934
Forget it.

604
00:35:46,133 --> 00:35:49,144
You don't have to pay me, so just fix the copier.

605
00:35:49,943 --> 00:35:51,144
It's annoying.

606
00:35:51,204 --> 00:35:53,613
(School administration, Graduate school)

607
00:35:59,454 --> 00:36:00,514
What the...

608
00:36:16,534 --> 00:36:19,034
What if this doesn't come out at the dry cleaner's?

609
00:36:24,573 --> 00:36:25,613
Hold on.

610
00:36:25,914 --> 00:36:28,244
Where did this guy go in the middle of fixing the copier?

611
00:36:28,613 --> 00:36:30,914
Excuse me. I heard the copier was out of order.

612
00:36:32,284 --> 00:36:33,454
Who are you?

613
00:36:33,883 --> 00:36:35,113
I'm here to fix the copier.

614
00:36:35,113 --> 00:36:36,883
The administration office called.

615
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:38,184
What?

616
00:36:38,693 --> 00:36:40,793
Then what about the other guy?

617
00:36:41,093 --> 00:36:42,394
- What? - What?

618
00:36:42,423 --> 00:36:43,764
- What? - What...

619
00:36:45,193 --> 00:36:46,233
What...

620
00:37:06,284 --> 00:37:07,383
Sweetie!

621
00:37:07,983 --> 00:37:10,284
Did I make you wait? You must be hungry.

622
00:37:37,883 --> 00:37:39,483
Ms. Kim, why are you here?

623
00:37:40,454 --> 00:37:42,054
For my class, of course.

624
00:37:44,084 --> 00:37:47,653
I remember speaking my mind in a way you would understand.

625
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:50,193
You are not to show up here.

626
00:37:50,693 --> 00:37:54,034
What gives you the right to order me around like that?

627
00:37:54,034 --> 00:37:56,034
I'll come to class if I want to,

628
00:37:56,034 --> 00:37:57,633
and I won't if I don't.

629
00:37:58,903 --> 00:38:00,173
Is that so?

630
00:38:03,704 --> 00:38:05,543
(Gift certificate)

631
00:38:05,744 --> 00:38:06,843
We're done now, right?

632
00:38:09,443 --> 00:38:12,554
Although I asked you nicely,

633
00:38:12,713 --> 00:38:14,314
this is what you chose to do.

634
00:38:15,054 --> 00:38:18,124
Can I take this as your way of saying...

635
00:38:18,124 --> 00:38:19,624
that you're interested in Mr. Oh?

636
00:38:21,954 --> 00:38:23,923
Think however you please.

637
00:38:25,164 --> 00:38:26,164
What?

638
00:38:26,164 --> 00:38:27,334
You're here early.

639
00:38:27,434 --> 00:38:29,304
Ms. Kim, it's been a while.

640
00:38:29,304 --> 00:38:30,633
Have you all been well?

641
00:38:31,363 --> 00:38:33,403
Why haven't we seen you around?

642
00:38:33,403 --> 00:38:34,534
It's been a while, hasn't it?

643
00:38:34,704 --> 00:38:36,374
- Tell me about it. - I know.

644
00:38:36,374 --> 00:38:38,673
You may not realize this,

645
00:38:39,974 --> 00:38:42,113
but nothing good will come from messing with me.

646
00:38:43,113 --> 00:38:44,514
Don't do anything you'll regret.

647
00:38:46,483 --> 00:38:48,454
What are you, some old class bully?

648
00:38:50,054 --> 00:38:51,124
What?

649
00:38:52,153 --> 00:38:55,193
- Hi, everyone! - Hi.

650
00:38:55,193 --> 00:38:58,463
- It's good to see you. - Hello.

651
00:38:59,293 --> 00:39:01,064
We'll continue this after class.

652
00:39:01,994 --> 00:39:03,034
Whatever.

653
00:39:03,034 --> 00:39:04,704
Let's warm up.

654
00:39:04,963 --> 00:39:06,804
I'm sure you're stressed out...

655
00:39:06,804 --> 00:39:08,474
from work and household affairs.

656
00:39:08,474 --> 00:39:09,843
- Yes! - Yes!

657
00:39:09,843 --> 00:39:12,144
With the dynamic Zumba class, blast away...

658
00:39:12,144 --> 00:39:13,374
- Stress. - Stress.

659
00:39:13,374 --> 00:39:14,443
And to the belly fat?

660
00:39:14,443 --> 00:39:15,514
- Goodbye! - Goodbye!

661
00:39:15,514 --> 00:39:16,983
- Zumba. - Zumba.

662
00:39:16,983 --> 00:39:19,284
- Zumba. - Zumba.

663
00:39:19,284 --> 00:39:21,414
Okay, we'll start off with claps.

664
00:39:21,814 --> 00:39:24,954
Until your body gives up, we won't stop.

665
00:39:24,954 --> 00:39:26,894
We'll kick it off with the V-step.

666
00:39:27,554 --> 00:39:28,624
V-step.

667
00:39:29,124 --> 00:39:30,224
V-step.

668
00:39:30,793 --> 00:39:31,823
V-step.

669
00:39:32,363 --> 00:39:33,463
V-step.

670
00:39:33,793 --> 00:39:34,863
V-step.

671
00:39:35,264 --> 00:39:36,434
Ms. Kim.

672
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:39,233
Don't raise your hands but your elbows.

673
00:39:39,434 --> 00:39:41,173
- My elbows? - Yes, your elbows.

674
00:39:41,903 --> 00:39:43,043
Lower your shoulders though.

675
00:39:43,043 --> 00:39:44,874
- I get it now. - Just the elbows.

676
00:39:44,874 --> 00:39:45,874
Up.

677
00:39:47,014 --> 00:39:50,084
- Look at her overtly flirting. - Looking good.

678
00:39:50,084 --> 00:39:52,854
Ms. Kim, that was good.

679
00:39:52,854 --> 00:39:54,113
- V-step. - He's cute.

680
00:39:54,383 --> 00:39:55,554
V-step.

681
00:39:55,923 --> 00:39:57,084
V-step.

682
00:39:57,323 --> 00:39:58,954
Everyone, hands above your heads.

683
00:40:00,994 --> 00:40:02,224
Nice!

684
00:40:03,463 --> 00:40:05,793
Everyone, take a look at Ms. Ji.

685
00:40:05,994 --> 00:40:07,463
Eyes on Ms. Ji.

686
00:40:07,764 --> 00:40:09,863
Goodness me. Ms. Ji looks cute.

687
00:40:09,863 --> 00:40:11,863
This isn't Bongsan Mask Dance, you know.

688
00:40:15,744 --> 00:40:17,104
Bongsan Mask Dance?

689
00:40:18,043 --> 00:40:19,314
That's hilarious.

690
00:40:20,644 --> 00:40:23,613
All right, then. Give me dynamic moves.

691
00:40:24,414 --> 00:40:26,854
Reach up high. That's it!

692
00:40:28,584 --> 00:40:31,823
Tap and tap. Up, down, up, down.

693
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:37,378
Yes. It's been a while since I slept that well.

694
00:40:37,609 --> 00:40:39,409
Normally, I wake up...

695
00:40:39,409 --> 00:40:42,018
feeling like my thoughts are all tangled up.

696
00:40:42,248 --> 00:40:43,779
But today, my mind couldn't be clearer.

697
00:40:44,389 --> 00:40:46,489
My body feels lighter too.

698
00:40:47,819 --> 00:40:50,989
That being said, did you change my medication?

699
00:40:50,989 --> 00:40:52,058
No.

700
00:40:52,058 --> 00:40:53,958
I prescribed the usual.

701
00:40:54,558 --> 00:40:55,598
Is that so?

702
00:40:55,929 --> 00:40:58,998
I thought the change in medication was what helped me sleep so well.

703
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:04,308
Sure, I hear you. We'll talk again soon.

704
00:41:08,078 --> 00:41:10,509
Did I take a sleeping pill yesterday?

705
00:41:13,009 --> 00:41:14,449
I didn't.

706
00:41:16,848 --> 00:41:19,288
Then how was I able to sleep that well?

707
00:41:22,788 --> 00:41:23,989
Oh, no. What's happening?

708
00:41:26,188 --> 00:41:28,898
The bubbles look great.

709
00:41:36,739 --> 00:41:37,808
Could it have been...

710
00:41:39,308 --> 00:41:40,569
the makgeolli?

711
00:41:43,578 --> 00:41:44,949
We took "Jang" from Oh Jang Soo...

712
00:41:45,578 --> 00:41:48,578
and "Kwang" from Ma Kwang Sook to name our liquor.

713
00:41:49,918 --> 00:41:52,788
Jang-Kwang Makgeolli was finally born.

714
00:41:58,259 --> 00:41:59,628
I came by with it...

715
00:42:00,688 --> 00:42:02,929
because I thought you should be...

716
00:42:03,529 --> 00:42:04,898
the first one to see it.

717
00:42:05,398 --> 00:42:07,369
(The late Oh Jang Soo)

718
00:42:10,398 --> 00:42:11,438
Just so you know,

719
00:42:12,339 --> 00:42:13,768
I have a confession to make.

720
00:42:14,909 --> 00:42:17,808
I was so busy with the release of our new product...

721
00:42:18,279 --> 00:42:21,279
that I wasn't able to spend as much time thinking about you.

722
00:42:23,148 --> 00:42:24,248
I'm sorry.

723
00:42:26,889 --> 00:42:28,018
Still,

724
00:42:28,688 --> 00:42:30,219
you'll understand, right?

725
00:42:33,159 --> 00:42:34,628
(Jang-Kwang Makgeolli)

726
00:42:43,299 --> 00:42:45,268
(Eagle Brewery)

727
00:42:57,989 --> 00:42:59,119
Goodness, mister.

728
00:43:00,219 --> 00:43:01,389
We meet again.

729
00:43:01,719 --> 00:43:02,989
Right.

730
00:43:04,018 --> 00:43:06,458
By the way, how's your back?

731
00:43:06,989 --> 00:43:09,359
Well, I guess it's good now.

732
00:43:09,659 --> 00:43:10,828
I'm glad to hear that.

733
00:43:12,029 --> 00:43:14,538
What brings you here?

734
00:43:17,139 --> 00:43:19,239
I'm here to see my wife.

735
00:43:19,869 --> 00:43:22,878
Is this where your lady rests?

736
00:43:23,978 --> 00:43:25,049
"Your lady?"

737
00:43:25,208 --> 00:43:27,578
My husband rests here as well.

738
00:43:31,688 --> 00:43:33,648
You are more romantic than you seem.

739
00:43:35,759 --> 00:43:38,288
Have a pleasant visit, then.

740
00:43:42,958 --> 00:43:44,898
Hold on. Wait.

741
00:43:49,699 --> 00:43:52,239
Will you wait for a moment?

742
00:43:55,308 --> 00:43:57,009
I have something to say.

743
00:43:57,609 --> 00:43:59,009
Like what?

744
00:43:59,779 --> 00:44:00,808
It'll only take ten minutes.

745
00:44:02,148 --> 00:44:04,589
Sure. All right.

746
00:44:05,018 --> 00:44:06,489
Please don't leave first.

747
00:44:06,489 --> 00:44:08,058
I'll only be ten minutes.

748
00:44:13,688 --> 00:44:15,359
What does he want to talk about?

749
00:44:17,799 --> 00:44:20,029
Is it about the wedding dress?

750
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:25,409
(Jang-Kwang Makgeolli)

751
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:30,679
(The late Oh Jang Soo)

752
00:44:30,978 --> 00:44:33,578
Wait. Was that her husband?

753
00:44:40,449 --> 00:44:41,659
It's me.

754
00:44:49,159 --> 00:44:51,628
(Jang-Kwang Makgeolli)

755
00:44:56,639 --> 00:45:00,268
I skipped lunch and now my stomach has started a riot.

756
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:04,949
Gosh, I'm starving.

757
00:45:09,949 --> 00:45:11,889
Did it go well with your lady?

758
00:45:12,688 --> 00:45:13,688
Yes.

759
00:45:15,589 --> 00:45:17,989
What did you want to talk about?

760
00:45:20,589 --> 00:45:22,898
It's nothing serious.

761
00:45:24,929 --> 00:45:27,228
I was wondering about the makgeolli you gave me.

762
00:45:27,969 --> 00:45:30,938
Can I get a few more bottles of it?

763
00:45:31,909 --> 00:45:35,078
You're not even bald, but you sure love freebies.

764
00:45:36,808 --> 00:45:38,308
I didn't mean I wanted it for free.

765
00:45:38,308 --> 00:45:39,609
I'll pay you. How much would it be?

766
00:45:39,708 --> 00:45:43,449
I was only joking. It was a joke.

767
00:45:44,648 --> 00:45:46,688
I don't love freebies.

768
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:48,259
How much is a bottle?

769
00:45:48,259 --> 00:45:51,489
Can you not take a joke so seriously?

770
00:45:51,728 --> 00:45:52,828
You can have it for free.

771
00:45:52,828 --> 00:45:55,699
No. I'll pay you. Sell it to me.

772
00:46:00,728 --> 00:46:02,168
Why are you angry?

773
00:46:04,808 --> 00:46:06,668
I'm not angry.

774
00:46:07,239 --> 00:46:08,878
Buy me a bowl of seolleongtang, then.

775
00:46:09,478 --> 00:46:11,779
There's a diner across the road, and it's not bad.

776
00:46:12,279 --> 00:46:13,279
Seolleongtang?

777
00:46:13,279 --> 00:46:16,578
I missed lunch, and now I see stars.

778
00:46:17,549 --> 00:46:18,619
Let's go.

779
00:46:19,489 --> 00:46:21,489
But I... Wait.

780
00:46:26,788 --> 00:46:27,859
Enjoy your meal.

781
00:46:29,759 --> 00:46:31,199
Thanks for the food.

782
00:46:38,639 --> 00:46:40,768
Do you come here often?

783
00:46:42,279 --> 00:46:43,538
I'm here every week.

784
00:46:45,449 --> 00:46:46,478
Every week?

785
00:46:49,648 --> 00:46:52,089
How long ago did she die?

786
00:46:54,248 --> 00:46:55,788
The way you talk about her...

787
00:46:57,659 --> 00:46:59,359
It has been 15 years.

788
00:46:59,688 --> 00:47:00,728
My gosh.

789
00:47:01,259 --> 00:47:02,628
That's amazing.

790
00:47:02,699 --> 00:47:05,299
Then you've been coming here every week...

791
00:47:05,328 --> 00:47:07,098
for 15 years with flowers?

792
00:47:07,299 --> 00:47:10,299
My wife loved flowers.

793
00:47:11,438 --> 00:47:12,938
You're more romantic than you look.

794
00:47:14,038 --> 00:47:16,609
I'm too busy working to visit often.

795
00:47:16,978 --> 00:47:19,878
I might end up homeless if the new product...

796
00:47:20,009 --> 00:47:21,819
we're launching doesn't do well.

797
00:47:34,828 --> 00:47:36,058
Why are you giving me that look?

798
00:47:36,828 --> 00:47:40,069
You said something tragic so nonchalantly.

799
00:47:41,699 --> 00:47:43,898
My husband died ten days after our wedding.

800
00:47:45,069 --> 00:47:47,639
Most tragedies don't feel tragic to me now.

801
00:47:51,578 --> 00:47:53,679
How did your husband die?

802
00:47:57,779 --> 00:47:58,918
A car accident.

803
00:48:00,619 --> 00:48:02,719
This is the worst time.

804
00:48:03,518 --> 00:48:04,589
How are you holding up?

805
00:48:06,259 --> 00:48:08,458
Whether I'm okay or not...

806
00:48:10,259 --> 00:48:11,869
I don't know, to be honest.

807
00:48:13,628 --> 00:48:15,268
I'm just getting through each day...

808
00:48:16,699 --> 00:48:18,339
as best I can.

809
00:48:24,679 --> 00:48:27,478
Oh, right. You must like makgeolli.

810
00:48:28,119 --> 00:48:29,779
I'm not a fan of it,

811
00:48:30,518 --> 00:48:32,889
but I enjoyed what you gave me.

812
00:48:33,918 --> 00:48:37,418
I never thought makgeolli would have those bubbles and acidity.

813
00:48:37,418 --> 00:48:39,688
It was unexpected.

814
00:48:40,558 --> 00:48:43,398
Makgeolli is a traditional alcoholic drink,

815
00:48:43,398 --> 00:48:46,498
but not many brewers make it the traditional way now.

816
00:48:47,369 --> 00:48:49,969
We don't use any additives.

817
00:48:50,069 --> 00:48:51,909
Rice, water, and nuruk.

818
00:48:51,909 --> 00:48:54,139
We make our makgeolli only with that.

819
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:55,779
We make our own nuruk...

820
00:48:55,779 --> 00:48:58,308
and keep our makgeolli in clay pots almost 100 years old...

821
00:48:58,509 --> 00:49:00,109
so it matures.

822
00:49:00,808 --> 00:49:03,219
There's no way it doesn't taste good.

823
00:49:04,679 --> 00:49:06,819
That's why it tasted rich.

824
00:49:08,359 --> 00:49:10,589
You must know a lot about alcohol.

825
00:49:11,989 --> 00:49:14,159
Not that much.

826
00:49:14,799 --> 00:49:16,299
Just a little.

827
00:49:16,598 --> 00:49:20,228
What you had last time. It'll be released as a new product.

828
00:49:20,828 --> 00:49:24,569
My goal is to make it the Dal Perignon of makgeolli.

829
00:49:25,308 --> 00:49:26,509
"Dal Perignon?"

830
00:49:27,768 --> 00:49:32,148
It's the name of a really famous French champagne.

831
00:49:33,848 --> 00:49:35,049
Have you tasted it?

832
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:36,179
Gosh, no.

833
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:39,089
How could I taste something that expensive?

834
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:41,619
How can you make the Dal Perignon...

835
00:49:41,619 --> 00:49:44,688
of makgeolli if you've never tasted the real thing?

836
00:49:44,859 --> 00:49:46,728
Aren't you being too irresponsible?

837
00:49:46,728 --> 00:49:49,728
I'm just saying that's what I want to do.

838
00:49:49,728 --> 00:49:51,569
How can you compare things when you don't even understand them?

839
00:49:51,569 --> 00:49:52,728
It's just wordplay.

840
00:49:54,098 --> 00:49:57,199
Do you need to poke and taste to see if something's edible or not?

841
00:49:57,199 --> 00:49:58,509
You just know.

842
00:50:08,918 --> 00:50:10,049
Why don't you eat some more?

843
00:50:10,449 --> 00:50:11,819
I'm done.

844
00:50:11,889 --> 00:50:13,589
I'm busy and must leave.

845
00:50:13,589 --> 00:50:16,458
Take your time and finish your food.

846
00:50:18,759 --> 00:50:20,359
- What... - Excuse me.

847
00:50:20,929 --> 00:50:21,929
Wait.

848
00:50:28,268 --> 00:50:30,199
Hang on.

851
00:50:35,478 --> 00:50:36,538
Hey!

852
00:50:40,609 --> 00:50:42,018
Where's your boss?

853
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:44,989
Her phone's turned off, and I can't reach her.

854
00:50:45,288 --> 00:50:46,748
She said she'd visit...

855
00:50:46,748 --> 00:50:48,889
the columbarium and a few dealerships.

856
00:50:50,159 --> 00:50:52,558
What's this smell?

857
00:50:56,128 --> 00:50:57,199
Don't!

858
00:50:58,168 --> 00:50:59,268
What are you doing?

859
00:51:00,998 --> 00:51:02,299
Are you wearing perfume?

860
00:51:05,069 --> 00:51:06,168
I am. Why?

861
00:51:07,139 --> 00:51:08,409
Get out this instant.

862
00:51:08,808 --> 00:51:09,839
What?

863
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:11,478
Get out right away!

864
00:51:13,779 --> 00:51:16,848
The owner of this place is my daughter.

865
00:51:17,078 --> 00:51:19,648
What right do you have to tell me to leave?

866
00:51:19,648 --> 00:51:21,659
I can't smell or taste the makgeolli...

867
00:51:21,659 --> 00:51:23,688
because of your strong perfume.

868
00:51:23,688 --> 00:51:25,328
Get out right now.

869
00:51:28,728 --> 00:51:30,058
It's not that strong.

870
00:51:30,228 --> 00:51:32,929
If you're going to wear makeup and perfume,

871
00:51:33,569 --> 00:51:36,069
don't even dream of coming here.

872
00:51:36,369 --> 00:51:37,469
Okay?

873
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:40,168
I don't believe this.

874
00:51:40,308 --> 00:51:42,708
You're just the brewery manager.

875
00:51:42,708 --> 00:51:44,208
Don't bark orders at me.

876
00:51:45,909 --> 00:51:46,978
Get out.

877
00:51:47,348 --> 00:51:49,248
Leave right away.

878
00:51:50,179 --> 00:51:52,449
Fine. I'll leave.

879
00:51:53,418 --> 00:51:54,449

881
00:52:06,369 --> 00:52:08,239
I was going to take it to a dealer.

882
00:52:08,569 --> 00:52:09,699
You can have it.

883
00:52:09,699 --> 00:52:12,109
I don't need this much.

884
00:52:12,208 --> 00:52:13,969
It's a special drink...

885
00:52:13,969 --> 00:52:16,478
made with good ingredients and lots of effort.

886
00:52:16,478 --> 00:52:17,839
Keep it in the fridge.

887
00:52:19,478 --> 00:52:20,549
Goodness.

888
00:52:23,779 --> 00:52:25,089
This is your car, right?

889
00:52:26,648 --> 00:52:28,518
Goodbye, then.

890
00:52:32,159 --> 00:52:33,288
Wait.

891
00:52:34,859 --> 00:52:35,929
How much is it?

892
00:52:37,259 --> 00:52:39,128
You bought me seolleongtang.

893
00:52:39,299 --> 00:52:42,299
It's not just a few bottles. I can't take it all for free.

894
00:52:43,139 --> 00:52:46,538
To be honest, you left a bad first impression.

895
00:52:47,739 --> 00:52:50,208
But I see you in a new light now.

896
00:52:51,239 --> 00:52:54,478
You stayed loyal to your late wife,

897
00:52:54,978 --> 00:52:58,219
and you gave me tough criticism for trying to make a drink...

898
00:52:58,219 --> 00:52:59,549
I barely knew.

899
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:03,819
I think you're nicer than you look.

What does "nicer than I look" mean?

How do I look to her?

906
00:53:36,188 --> 00:53:37,288
Is this yours?

00:54:07,018 --> 00:54:08,688
Why are you here out of the blue?

915
00:54:18,598 --> 00:54:19,929
You look more tired...

916
00:54:20,768 --> 00:54:22,239
than you did last time.

917
00:54:23,038 --> 00:54:26,339
I've been really busy recently with the new product release.

918
00:54:28,509 --> 00:54:31,239
I'm cheerful, and I'm doing well,

919
00:54:31,239 --> 00:54:32,348
so don't worry.

920
00:54:33,708 --> 00:54:36,018
I really am doing well.

921
00:54:36,018 --> 00:54:38,119
I eat well and sleep well.

922
00:54:39,319 --> 00:54:42,958
I even feel bad for your brother sometimes.

923
00:54:44,659 --> 00:54:45,929
Why would you say that?

924
00:54:46,958 --> 00:54:48,659
He'd want more than anyone...

925
00:54:48,659 --> 00:54:50,628
for you to be happy and well.

926
00:54:52,628 --> 00:54:54,728
I talked to my mom and pleaded with her.

927
00:54:55,369 --> 00:54:57,098
She won't call you again.

928
00:54:58,969 --> 00:55:00,509
I understand completely...

929
00:55:01,208 --> 00:55:03,078
why she thinks and says what she does.

930
00:55:12,719 --> 00:55:14,319
It's not too late.

931
00:55:16,819 --> 00:55:18,188
Close down the brewery...

932
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:20,429
and live in peace.

933
00:55:21,728 --> 00:55:23,859
It's hard work even for a man.

934
00:55:23,958 --> 00:55:25,299
- A single woman... - Hey.

935
00:55:25,598 --> 00:55:27,869
Don't make such a discriminatory remark.

936
00:55:28,839 --> 00:55:32,538
If a man can do it, so can a woman.

937
00:55:33,739 --> 00:55:35,239
That's not what I mean.

938
00:55:35,239 --> 00:55:37,239
My nickname is TN.

939
00:55:38,279 --> 00:55:39,308
What?

940
00:55:39,578 --> 00:55:40,779
"Total Nutcase."

941
00:55:44,748 --> 00:55:46,248
A total nutcase.

942
00:55:46,248 --> 00:55:47,848
With a dogged spirit,

943
00:55:47,848 --> 00:55:49,958
once I put my heart into it, I make it happen.

944
00:55:51,458 --> 00:55:52,889
Just give me some time.

945
00:55:53,728 --> 00:55:55,359
I will make Eagle Brewery...

946
00:55:55,359 --> 00:55:58,768
one of the top three breweries in the country.

947
00:55:59,799 --> 00:56:03,369
Just give me the benefit of the doubt.

948
00:56:19,688 --> 00:56:20,848
Is something wrong?

949
00:56:21,389 --> 00:56:23,018
How can you sound so confident?

950
00:56:23,558 --> 00:56:25,489
Even if you beg like crazy, it won't be enough.

951
00:56:25,489 --> 00:56:26,788
And now you're raising your voice?

952
00:56:27,458 --> 00:56:30,398
Don't you feel ashamed or guilty at all?

953
00:56:32,498 --> 00:56:34,299
I have a customer. I'll call you later.

954
00:56:39,109 --> 00:56:40,538
Welcome.

955
00:56:43,779 --> 00:56:44,839
You're here.

956
00:56:45,109 --> 00:56:46,779
I'm on my way home after seeing my sister-in-law.

957
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:50,219
Is something wrong?

958
00:56:53,219 --> 00:56:54,719
Would you like some canned coffee?

959
00:57:07,699 --> 00:57:10,498
I was speaking to my husband.

960
00:57:11,668 --> 00:57:13,139
You had a fight with him?

961
00:57:15,938 --> 00:57:19,208
Maybe it's because I've been busy working on opening the store,

962
00:57:19,208 --> 00:57:21,308
but I keep getting sensitive about trivial things.

963
00:57:22,748 --> 00:57:24,719
How are you doing with your wife?

964
00:57:24,848 --> 00:57:25,848
What?

965
00:57:27,619 --> 00:57:31,159
Since we have lived apart for so long,

966
00:57:31,859 --> 00:57:33,259
to be honest, we don't even fight.

967
00:57:34,029 --> 00:57:35,998
How long has it been?

968
00:57:36,799 --> 00:57:39,828
My daughter went abroad to study...

969
00:57:39,828 --> 00:57:41,668
when she was a first grader.

970
00:57:42,768 --> 00:57:43,969
It's been ten years.

971
00:57:44,038 --> 00:57:45,639
For that long?

972
00:57:45,639 --> 00:57:46,739
My wife promised to come back...

973
00:57:46,739 --> 00:57:48,208
when my daughter started high school.

974
00:57:48,978 --> 00:57:51,409
But after she entered high school, my wife said she would return...

975
00:57:51,409 --> 00:57:53,378
after my daughter graduated from high school and went to college.

976
00:57:53,378 --> 00:57:55,679
Gosh, I didn't know that.

977
00:57:58,248 --> 00:58:01,049
If it's not something serious, you should just apologize first.

978
00:58:03,058 --> 00:58:05,458
And tell your husband to make some time for me.

979
00:58:05,458 --> 00:58:06,688
Let's have a meal together.

980
00:58:07,759 --> 00:58:10,759
He's really busy with work these days.

981
00:58:11,598 --> 00:58:13,228
Let's eat when things settle down.

982
00:58:15,898 --> 00:58:17,469
(Closed)

983
00:58:25,949 --> 00:58:28,078
Goodness me. Ms. Ji looks cute.

984
00:58:28,078 --> 00:58:30,119
This isn't Bongsan Mask Dance, you know.

985
00:58:31,549 --> 00:58:32,889
Bongsan Mask Dance?

986
00:58:33,889 --> 00:58:35,148
That's hilarious.

987
00:58:36,119 --> 00:58:37,159
Gosh.

988
00:58:37,589 --> 00:58:40,389
Bongsan Mask Dance? Why would he say that?

989
00:58:41,859 --> 00:58:43,929
I mean, Ms. Kim, that vixen was there.

990
00:58:45,799 --> 00:58:48,168
Thinking about it really burns me up.

991
00:58:48,969 --> 00:58:49,998
I mean,

992
00:58:51,139 --> 00:58:53,308
why does this look like Bongsan Mask Dance?

993
00:58:54,339 --> 00:58:57,038
This is nothing like Bongsan Mask Dance.

994
00:58:58,139 --> 00:59:01,308
One, two, three, four.

995
00:59:01,378 --> 00:59:04,449
One, two, three, four.

996
00:59:05,279 --> 00:59:06,918
One, two, three...

997
00:59:10,688 --> 00:59:11,989
Darn it.

998
00:59:25,808 --> 00:59:27,409
Since it's quite bubbly,

999
00:59:27,409 --> 00:59:29,509
I'll try this champagne flute.

1000
00:59:32,808 --> 00:59:33,848
What?

1001
00:59:40,348 --> 00:59:43,589
(Jang-Kwang Makgeolli)

1002
00:59:48,799 --> 00:59:50,228
Oh, dear.

1003
01:00:00,938 --> 01:00:02,708
The bubbles are quite strong.

1004
01:00:03,378 --> 01:00:04,378
My gosh.

1005
01:00:05,279 --> 01:00:07,478
I didn't know makgeolli could do this too.

1006
01:00:19,889 --> 01:00:21,989
The aroma is a bit mild,

1007
01:00:22,828 --> 01:00:24,029
but the strong bubbles...

1008
01:00:24,929 --> 01:00:26,498
give the taste a twist.

1009
01:00:28,128 --> 01:00:31,098
It's like lemon juice with honey in it.

1010
01:00:32,938 --> 01:00:35,268
What is this refreshing kick?

1011
01:00:35,578 --> 01:00:36,739
My gosh.

1012
01:00:37,708 --> 01:00:40,949
There's something beguiling about this makgeolli.

1013
01:00:57,728 --> 01:00:59,828
(Eagle Brewery)

1014
01:01:01,098 --> 01:01:03,639
(Jang-Kwang Makgeolli)

1015
01:01:06,469 --> 01:01:08,168
(Jang-Kwang Makgeolli)

1016
01:01:08,708 --> 01:01:10,839
How have you been, Heung Soo?

1017
01:01:13,148 --> 01:01:16,679
I'm writing to you because I have good news.

1018
01:01:18,378 --> 01:01:19,949
Your brother's last work,

1019
01:01:20,918 --> 01:01:24,819
Jang-Kwang Makgeolli, has finally come out into the world.

1020
01:01:25,489 --> 01:01:27,688
(Eagle Brewery Unrefined Makgeolli)

1021
01:01:33,069 --> 01:01:35,969
This makgeolli has Jang Soo's dream...

1022
01:01:36,239 --> 01:01:38,668
- Hello. - and Jang Soo's life in it.

1023
01:01:40,839 --> 01:01:44,139
I can't just let this meaningful day pass by.

1024
01:01:44,139 --> 01:01:45,578
(Oh Heung Soo)

1025
01:01:48,748 --> 01:01:50,449
Mr. Rooftop House.

1026
01:01:51,418 --> 01:01:52,489
Yes?

1027
01:01:53,049 --> 01:01:55,288
You've got a letter.

1028
01:01:57,159 --> 01:01:58,159
Thank you.

1029
01:01:58,319 --> 01:01:59,429
And...

1030
01:02:00,929 --> 01:02:03,598
a gas payment reminder.

1031
01:02:03,728 --> 01:02:07,029
Make sure to pay the bills on time so you won't get it again.

1032
01:02:08,168 --> 01:02:09,168
Okay.

1033
01:02:09,498 --> 01:02:10,639
Make sure to pay it.

1034
01:02:11,168 --> 01:02:12,168
Sure.

1035
01:02:13,308 --> 01:02:14,308
Bye.

1036
01:02:19,949 --> 01:02:21,049
Kwang Sook?

1037
01:02:24,779 --> 01:02:26,719
(I miss you, my brothers-in-law.)

1038
01:02:27,418 --> 01:02:30,119
I want to gather together and share the joy.

1039
01:02:31,159 --> 01:02:33,728
I also want to express my gratitude to you...

1040
01:02:33,728 --> 01:02:35,628
who have believed in me and watched over me.

1041
01:02:38,869 --> 01:02:42,268
Your brother must be very happy up there.

1042
01:02:45,098 --> 01:02:47,208
I invite you to Eagle Brewery...

1043
01:02:47,438 --> 01:02:49,478
this Sunday at 7pm.

1044
01:02:50,139 --> 01:02:52,179
I won't accept any excuses...

1045
01:02:52,179 --> 01:02:54,549
like having other plans or being busy.

1046
01:02:57,279 --> 01:02:59,748
Since I'll always be your sister-in-law,

1047
01:03:00,188 --> 01:03:02,518
please accept my invitation without saying no.

1048
01:03:06,359 --> 01:03:08,659
I miss you, my brothers-in-law.

1049
01:03:51,699 --> 01:03:54,239
(For Eagle Brothers)

1050
01:03:54,438 --> 01:03:55,438
Jang-Kwang Makgeolli!

1051
01:03:55,438 --> 01:03:56,808
- Bravo! - Bravo!

1052
01:03:57,378 --> 01:03:58,409
Is this family?

1053
01:03:58,409 --> 01:04:01,078
Don't you think you should take over the brewery, Chun Soo?

1054
01:04:01,109 --> 01:04:02,518
You are out of work now!

1055
01:04:02,648 --> 01:04:05,819
Bongsan Mask Dance.

1056
01:04:05,819 --> 01:04:07,819
You humiliated me!

1057
01:04:07,819 --> 01:04:09,119
About Ms. Kim.

1058
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:12,089
She's a vixen with 99 tails.

1059
01:04:12,089 --> 01:04:13,489
This is Ma Kwang Sook.

1060
01:04:13,489 --> 01:04:14,558
LX Hotel?

1061
01:04:14,558 --> 01:04:16,859
There will be no second chance.

1062
01:04:16,859 --> 01:04:19,529
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
