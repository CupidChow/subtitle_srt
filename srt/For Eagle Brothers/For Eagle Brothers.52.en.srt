1
00:00:22,074 --> 00:00:23,114
My gosh.

2
00:00:24,644 --> 00:00:26,644
Hey, that's weird.

3
00:00:28,114 --> 00:00:29,614
How can there be...

4
00:00:29,614 --> 00:00:31,984
a sun and a moon in the sky at the same time?

5
00:00:34,424 --> 00:00:35,754
Kwang Sook.

6
00:00:36,894 --> 00:00:37,894
Darling.

7
00:00:39,094 --> 00:00:40,264
Come over here.

8
00:00:41,494 --> 00:00:44,134
I've never seen anything like this.

9
00:00:44,134 --> 00:00:45,164
Darling!

10
00:00:45,704 --> 00:00:46,704
Darling.

11
00:00:47,804 --> 00:00:48,834
Darling.

12
00:00:51,004 --> 00:00:52,804
(Episode 52)

13
00:00:53,974 --> 00:00:55,274
My goodness.

14
00:00:58,344 --> 00:00:59,884
Good morning, hubby.

15
00:00:59,884 --> 00:01:00,884
Hey.

16
00:01:02,884 --> 00:01:03,924
Here.

17
00:01:05,484 --> 00:01:06,624
Thanks.

18
00:01:12,164 --> 00:01:13,194
Listen.

19
00:01:13,864 --> 00:01:14,994
I had a dream.

20
00:01:15,364 --> 00:01:16,364
What was it?

21
00:01:17,164 --> 00:01:19,464
I was walking alone in the forest...

22
00:01:19,464 --> 00:01:21,504
where we camped on our honeymoon.

23
00:01:22,704 --> 00:01:24,574
I looked up at the sky,

24
00:01:25,944 --> 00:01:29,444
and I saw the sun and moon shining next to each other.

25
00:01:30,044 --> 00:01:31,814
That's an extraordinary dream.

26
00:01:32,644 --> 00:01:34,184
We should buy a lottery ticket.

27
00:01:34,184 --> 00:01:35,754
No, it's not that.

28
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:37,684
I have a feeling...

29
00:01:40,854 --> 00:01:42,324
it's a conception dream.

30
00:01:43,354 --> 00:01:46,094
My gosh. What are you talking about?

31
00:01:46,094 --> 00:01:47,834
Don't be silly.

32
00:01:47,834 --> 00:01:49,534
Why is that silly?

33
00:01:49,534 --> 00:01:51,434
It's not impossible.

34
00:01:51,434 --> 00:01:54,674
Are you crazy? Think about our age.

35
00:01:55,204 --> 00:01:56,474
Stop talking nonsense...

36
00:01:56,474 --> 00:01:58,574
and get ready and come over for breakfast.

37
00:01:59,344 --> 00:02:00,514
My gosh.

38
00:02:01,744 --> 00:02:03,244
What stupidity.

39
00:02:06,244 --> 00:02:08,684
Does she have to be that negative about it?

40
00:02:13,124 --> 00:02:14,794
Goodness...

41
00:02:19,224 --> 00:02:20,734
Thank you for the food.

42
00:02:21,634 --> 00:02:23,394
Why don't you join us?

43
00:02:23,834 --> 00:02:25,604
I prefer to eat later.

44
00:02:26,204 --> 00:02:27,334
Enjoy your breakfast.

45
00:02:28,074 --> 00:02:29,104
I will.

46
00:02:30,904 --> 00:02:31,974
Let's eat.

47
00:02:31,974 --> 00:02:33,174
- Thank you. - Thank you.

48
00:02:38,584 --> 00:02:39,584
Here.

49
00:02:42,814 --> 00:02:44,724
I can manage on my own.

50
00:02:45,224 --> 00:02:48,094
You don't like fish because you hate picking out the bones.

51
00:02:48,094 --> 00:02:50,124
I'll take all the bones out for you.

52
00:02:50,124 --> 00:02:51,594
All you have to do is enjoy.

53
00:02:54,134 --> 00:02:55,564
Can you do that for me, Dad?

54
00:02:56,994 --> 00:02:58,034
Me too.

55
00:02:58,264 --> 00:03:00,904
You can fend for yourselves.

56
00:03:00,904 --> 00:03:04,044
My gosh. I don't believe this. How could you?

57
00:03:04,474 --> 00:03:06,704
You should get married too, then.

58
00:03:06,844 --> 00:03:07,914
What?

59
00:03:21,154 --> 00:03:23,454
Kwang Sook and Ms. Gong have left,

60
00:03:24,164 --> 00:03:25,894
and the table feels too bare.

61
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:28,134
It does.

62
00:03:28,694 --> 00:03:31,504
I wonder if they're eating well on time.

63
00:03:33,364 --> 00:03:35,634
Golden Castle is one of the best senior residences,

64
00:03:35,634 --> 00:03:37,674
so I bet they provide high-quality food.

65
00:03:38,374 --> 00:03:40,814
The chairman has a housekeeper, so I'm sure...

66
00:03:40,814 --> 00:03:44,314
Kwang Sook eats as well as she would if she were at a hotel.

67
00:03:48,014 --> 00:03:49,054
So...

68
00:03:49,784 --> 00:03:52,184
I'm sorry to share something so heavy at breakfast,

69
00:03:52,884 --> 00:03:54,724
but I thought you should all know.

70
00:03:56,254 --> 00:03:59,364
Se Ri's father was arrested and detained.

71
00:04:02,094 --> 00:04:03,634
He went to prison?

72
00:04:04,004 --> 00:04:05,764
No, he's in lockup.

73
00:04:06,434 --> 00:04:09,474
He'll be there for questioning and the trial.

74
00:04:10,304 --> 00:04:12,974
Oh, dear. Se Ri must be in shock.

75
00:04:14,914 --> 00:04:16,844
I feel so sorry for her.

76
00:04:18,044 --> 00:04:19,784
If I think of what he did...

77
00:04:20,484 --> 00:04:22,914
to our family business, he deserves much worse.

78
00:04:24,984 --> 00:04:26,424
But if I think of Beom Soo and Kang Soo,

79
00:04:27,124 --> 00:04:28,524
I feel somewhat bad.

80
00:04:30,924 --> 00:04:32,024
It's complicated.

81
00:04:36,194 --> 00:04:40,134
(Eagle Brewery Unrefined Makgeolli)

82
00:04:44,174 --> 00:04:45,304
Kwang Sook.

83
00:04:45,504 --> 00:04:47,144
Good morning, Vice-CEO.

84
00:04:47,144 --> 00:04:48,874
Good morning to you too.

85
00:04:49,474 --> 00:04:52,684
Have you recovered from the honeymoon?

86
00:04:52,884 --> 00:04:54,154
You bet.

87
00:04:55,654 --> 00:04:56,654
Kwang Sook.

88
00:04:58,254 --> 00:05:00,184
Dokgo Tak was detained.

89
00:05:00,924 --> 00:05:01,994
When?

90
00:05:02,194 --> 00:05:04,394
Yesterday. Beom Soo told us this morning.

91
00:05:06,224 --> 00:05:07,934
It has happened at last.

92
00:05:12,234 --> 00:05:14,734
I thought I'd feel relieved, but I don't.

93
00:05:15,734 --> 00:05:17,304
I feel uncomfortable.

94
00:05:18,074 --> 00:05:20,944
If I think of what he did to the brewery,

95
00:05:20,944 --> 00:05:22,244
he deserves the punishment,

96
00:05:23,174 --> 00:05:26,344
but when I think of Se Ri, Beom Soo, and Kang Soo,

97
00:05:27,344 --> 00:05:28,714
I feel bad for him.

98
00:05:30,554 --> 00:05:32,184
It's pretty complicated.

99
00:05:35,954 --> 00:05:37,324
- Hey. - Boss.

100
00:05:38,924 --> 00:05:40,094
Did you have a good time?

101
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:42,094
Yes, I did.

102
00:05:42,394 --> 00:05:43,994
You're back.

103
00:05:48,374 --> 00:05:50,474
Is something wrong, Mr. Go?

104
00:05:50,474 --> 00:05:52,004
Why the deep sigh?

105
00:05:52,004 --> 00:05:53,144
It's nothing.

106
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:54,614
It's not nothing.

107
00:05:54,614 --> 00:05:57,214
You're always sighing and you barely eat.

108
00:05:57,784 --> 00:05:59,144
Did you split up with your girlfriend?

109
00:05:59,144 --> 00:06:00,414
I did not!

110
00:06:00,414 --> 00:06:03,054
I feel nothing for a woman who dumped me and left!

111
00:06:05,684 --> 00:06:07,384
You did break up.

112
00:06:09,054 --> 00:06:10,224
Who's the woman?

113
00:06:10,894 --> 00:06:13,524
Who dumped you and left?

114
00:06:14,334 --> 00:06:15,564
Shall I talk to her?

115
00:06:16,234 --> 00:06:17,534
There's no such woman.

116
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:32,644
It's Madam Gong.

117
00:06:36,114 --> 00:06:39,054
- Good morning, Madam Gong. - Good morning, Madam Gong.

118
00:06:40,754 --> 00:06:42,524
Good morning.

119
00:06:42,924 --> 00:06:44,894
Did you all sleep well?

120
00:06:44,894 --> 00:06:47,964
I didn't sleep a wink.

121
00:06:48,064 --> 00:06:49,064
Why not?

122
00:06:49,264 --> 00:06:52,104
I couldn't sleep because I couldn't believe...

123
00:06:52,104 --> 00:06:55,074
the news that you had returned to Golden Castle.

124
00:06:55,634 --> 00:06:58,704
I'm flattered. Thanks for the welcome.

125
00:06:58,704 --> 00:07:01,214
Dr. Kim. Thank you.

126
00:07:01,344 --> 00:07:02,714
To welcome you back,

127
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:05,214
I will treat you to dinner today.

128
00:07:05,644 --> 00:07:08,654
No. You can't do that.

129
00:07:08,654 --> 00:07:10,384
I talked to her yesterday...

130
00:07:10,384 --> 00:07:12,424
and asked her to free her schedule this evening.

131
00:07:13,424 --> 00:07:14,424
Wait.

132
00:07:15,194 --> 00:07:17,664
Both of you are way too late.

133
00:07:17,664 --> 00:07:20,764
I already booked us a table at the French restaurant...

134
00:07:20,764 --> 00:07:23,664
Madam Gong loves so much.

135
00:07:23,934 --> 00:07:25,534
Darn you.

136
00:07:25,534 --> 00:07:27,064
Don't fight.

137
00:07:27,064 --> 00:07:29,734
You should play rock-paper-scissors.

138
00:07:29,734 --> 00:07:31,704
- Are you ready? Rock... - Rock...

139
00:07:32,344 --> 00:07:33,344

140
00:07:33,444 --> 00:07:34,444
- scissors! - Scissors!

141
00:07:34,914 --> 00:07:36,674
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Scissors.

00:07:41,854 --> 00:07:42,854
- Come on. - Rock...

145
00:07:42,854 --> 00:07:43,984
What do we do?

146
00:07:44,184 --> 00:07:45,824
Play one more round.

147
00:07:45,824 --> 00:07:46,824
- Yes. - Okay.

148
00:07:46,824 --> 00:07:48,524

- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

152
00:07:58,104 --> 00:08:01,174
Rock-paper-scissors isn't as fun as it used to be.

153
00:08:01,174 --> 00:08:04,304
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

(Chairman Han Dong Seok)

158
00:08:12,484 --> 00:08:13,684
Did you sleep well?

159
00:08:15,214 --> 00:08:16,584
How sweet of you.

160
00:08:17,154 --> 00:08:20,354
Of course. I slept well.

161
00:08:21,554 --> 00:08:23,924
Everything's fine and you're well?

162
00:08:25,064 --> 00:08:27,764
Yes. Thanks to you,

163
00:08:28,064 --> 00:08:30,564
I'm enjoying my elegant retirement.

164
00:08:30,964 --> 00:08:32,804
Are you well too?

165
00:08:35,774 --> 00:08:37,434
The thing is, Mother,

166
00:08:40,274 --> 00:08:42,274
I think I had a conception dream.

167
00:08:45,044 --> 00:08:46,144
A conception dream?

168
00:08:46,214 --> 00:08:47,444
It's not a conception dream.

169
00:08:47,914 --> 00:08:50,014
It was a stupid, random dream.

170
00:08:50,014 --> 00:08:51,924
You don't know enough to call it that.

171
00:08:52,384 --> 00:08:53,424
Mom.

172
00:08:53,424 --> 00:08:55,854
I'm too old to have a baby.

173
00:08:57,624 --> 00:08:59,364
Even women older than you...

174
00:08:59,364 --> 00:09:01,864
pop babies out no problem.

175
00:09:02,194 --> 00:09:03,994
No, forget it.

176
00:09:03,994 --> 00:09:06,264
I'm busy. I'll hang up if that's all you have to say.

177
00:09:07,804 --> 00:09:09,934
My gosh. She'll be the death of me.

178
00:09:16,644 --> 00:09:19,714

Inmate 1523.

182
00:09:43,204 --> 00:09:44,644
Your wife's here to see you.

183
00:09:57,184 --> 00:09:59,324
Are you Ms. Jang Mi Ae, who's here for a visitation?

184
00:10:02,054 --> 00:10:03,054
Yes.

185
00:10:03,694 --> 00:10:05,924
He refused to see you.

186
00:10:07,464 --> 00:10:10,334
Pardon? He refused to see me?

187
00:10:10,864 --> 00:10:13,264
Yes. He didn't mention any specific reason.

188
00:10:13,734 --> 00:10:15,404
He just said he didn't want to see you.

189
00:10:27,444 --> 00:10:28,654
I don't know...

190
00:10:30,054 --> 00:10:33,284
why Dad refused to see Mom.

191
00:10:35,424 --> 00:10:38,364
I think I can understand him.

192
00:10:41,464 --> 00:10:42,994
When you go through a hard time,

193
00:10:42,994 --> 00:10:46,234
there are times when you want to avoid your loved ones.

194
00:10:48,934 --> 00:10:51,174
When you feel sorry and ashamed...

195
00:10:51,244 --> 00:10:53,244
all at the same time,

196
00:10:53,774 --> 00:10:56,444
you may feel like it's better not to see anyone.

197
00:10:59,244 --> 00:11:00,414
You think so?

198
00:11:02,054 --> 00:11:04,284
Since he loves you and your mom so much,

199
00:11:04,884 --> 00:11:07,184
he's probably afraid that he will be heartbroken...

200
00:11:07,624 --> 00:11:09,124
to see you and her.

201
00:11:12,924 --> 00:11:17,034
I wish I were a kinder and nicer daughter to him.

202
00:11:22,874 --> 00:11:24,374
I ran away from home,

203
00:11:25,004 --> 00:11:27,004
threw a tantrum,

204
00:11:28,974 --> 00:11:30,714
and even said a lot of harsh things to him.

205
00:11:30,714 --> 00:11:32,384
I didn't mean any of that though.

206
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:35,714
Now that I think about it,

207
00:11:36,814 --> 00:11:38,524
I regret everything I did.

208
00:11:42,454 --> 00:11:44,324
I think I'm a horrible daughter.

209
00:11:55,934 --> 00:11:57,574
Who are you?

210
00:11:57,734 --> 00:12:01,044
Hello. I'm here as a housekeeper.

211
00:12:01,374 --> 00:12:02,774
I started working here today.

212
00:12:03,814 --> 00:12:05,014
A housekeeper?

213
00:12:05,514 --> 00:12:06,514
Yes.

214
00:12:06,784 --> 00:12:09,814
Mi Sun, you're home early.

215
00:12:10,514 --> 00:12:13,584
Yes. The work at the headquarters ended early.

216
00:12:13,684 --> 00:12:15,394
By the way, who is she?

217
00:12:16,224 --> 00:12:17,224
Well...

218
00:12:17,994 --> 00:12:20,094
I was feeling tired,

219
00:12:20,264 --> 00:12:22,934
so I asked her to help me with house chores.

220
00:12:28,034 --> 00:12:31,504
She says she will clean thoroughly at a low price.

221
00:12:33,874 --> 00:12:34,944
Ok Bun.

222
00:12:36,914 --> 00:12:40,744
How could you do this without consulting me?

223
00:12:42,914 --> 00:12:46,384
Please try to understand my situation.

224
00:12:47,754 --> 00:12:49,254
I feel nauseous,

225
00:12:50,294 --> 00:12:52,994
and I'm too tired to do house chores.

226
00:12:54,194 --> 00:12:56,034
But you make me uncomfortable.

227
00:12:57,064 --> 00:12:59,464
When did I make you uncomfortable?

228
00:12:59,764 --> 00:13:02,774
Come on. You did make me uncomfortable.

229
00:13:02,904 --> 00:13:06,474
And Chun Soo talked brusquely to Heung Soo.

230
00:13:07,944 --> 00:13:09,944
We just said a few words, and you couldn't stand it?

231
00:13:12,044 --> 00:13:13,184
It's not like that.

232
00:13:13,184 --> 00:13:16,414
Is this you looking down on me? This isn't right, Ok Bun.

233
00:13:17,484 --> 00:13:19,584
It's not that I look down on you.

234
00:13:19,754 --> 00:13:21,354
I just feel uncomfortable, so...

235
00:13:23,324 --> 00:13:27,464
I just hired a housekeeper for everyone's sake.

236
00:13:27,464 --> 00:13:29,894
If you cared about how I would feel,

237
00:13:30,094 --> 00:13:32,064
you would've talked to me first.

238
00:13:32,564 --> 00:13:34,734
Money isn't the answer to everything, Ok Bun.

239
00:13:35,804 --> 00:13:36,834
Mi Sun.

240
00:13:37,404 --> 00:13:39,774
How could you put it like that?

241
00:13:41,374 --> 00:13:42,374
My gosh.

242
00:13:43,944 --> 00:13:45,884
What's the matter? Did something happen?

243
00:13:50,084 --> 00:13:52,584
Ok Bun's morning sickness is bad,

244
00:13:52,584 --> 00:13:53,824
and she often feels sick.

245
00:13:54,284 --> 00:13:57,094
So I've been doing most of the house chores so far.

246
00:13:57,454 --> 00:13:59,794
It must've been hard...

247
00:14:00,364 --> 00:14:02,864
working at the store and at home.

248
00:14:04,564 --> 00:14:06,904
I'd be lying if I said it wasn't hard.

249
00:14:07,804 --> 00:14:10,374
Still, I tried to do things happily,

250
00:14:10,374 --> 00:14:12,944
thinking of Chun Soo and the family.

251
00:14:13,204 --> 00:14:14,644
It actually felt rewarding.

252
00:14:15,914 --> 00:14:17,914
But she suddenly hired a housekeeper...

253
00:14:17,914 --> 00:14:19,384
without consulting me.

254
00:14:20,684 --> 00:14:22,454
I feel like she looks down on me.

255
00:14:23,514 --> 00:14:25,454
I think this is just wrong, Kwang Sook.

256
00:14:25,724 --> 00:14:29,554
To be honest, I don't know what I did wrong.

257
00:14:30,394 --> 00:14:32,224
Now that I can't help her with the house chores,

258
00:14:32,794 --> 00:14:34,324
I feel uncomfortable...

259
00:14:34,494 --> 00:14:36,664
and bad for her. That's why I hired a housekeeper.

260
00:14:37,434 --> 00:14:39,564
Why would it make her so upset?

261
00:14:40,234 --> 00:14:43,174
I spent my fair share of time and money to find a good housekeeper.

262
00:14:43,734 --> 00:14:46,174
I did everything I could as a kind gesture.

263
00:14:46,944 --> 00:14:49,444
But she says money isn't the answer to everything.

264
00:14:50,114 --> 00:14:53,714
This is really upsetting, Kwang Sook.

265
00:14:54,814 --> 00:14:58,854
Mi Sun just said that because she was upset.

266
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:00,724
Don't take it too seriously.

267
00:15:01,594 --> 00:15:03,494
I liked it when you were here.

268
00:15:05,024 --> 00:15:06,294
Mi Sun is...

269
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:09,634
someone difficult to please.

270
00:15:12,634 --> 00:15:13,664
My gosh.

271
00:15:17,534 --> 00:15:19,344
- Kwang Sook. - Have a seat.

272
00:15:19,474 --> 00:15:20,904
Okay. Did you want to see us?

273
00:15:24,274 --> 00:15:26,184
I hope I didn't call you over when you were busy.

274
00:15:26,344 --> 00:15:28,014
It's break time now.

275
00:15:28,584 --> 00:15:31,324
What is it you wanted to tell us urgently?

276
00:15:31,724 --> 00:15:32,824
Well...

277
00:15:35,024 --> 00:15:36,994
Mi Sun and Ok Bun had...

278
00:15:37,624 --> 00:15:39,194
a huge fight today.

279
00:15:40,094 --> 00:15:41,194
- What? - What?

280
00:15:41,964 --> 00:15:43,534
If you keep just siding with your wives,

281
00:15:43,534 --> 00:15:45,304
I'm afraid you will grow apart.

282
00:15:46,064 --> 00:15:48,134
So I called an emergency meeting.

283
00:15:49,204 --> 00:15:50,504
What did they fight about?

284
00:15:52,204 --> 00:15:53,774
Ok Bun...

285
00:15:54,374 --> 00:15:56,244
hired a housekeeper...

286
00:15:56,544 --> 00:15:58,984
without telling Mi Sun about it.

287
00:16:00,944 --> 00:16:02,754
Is that so?

288
00:16:03,384 --> 00:16:04,414
My gosh.

289
00:16:05,354 --> 00:16:07,184
She's being a bit too much.

290
00:16:10,024 --> 00:16:12,264
Mi Sun can be a real stickler too.

291
00:16:14,064 --> 00:16:16,534
- What did you say? - You may not know that,

292
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:18,564
but she's always so stubborn.

293
00:16:18,764 --> 00:16:20,264
She is too inflexible.

294
00:16:20,934 --> 00:16:23,674
What about Ok Bun then? Is she a loose cannon?

295
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,174
A loose cannon?

296
00:16:25,274 --> 00:16:26,674
You can't say that. It's upsetting.

297
00:16:26,674 --> 00:16:27,944
Why would you be upset?

298
00:16:27,944 --> 00:16:29,944
Stop. You can't be like this.

299
00:16:30,244 --> 00:16:32,944
I'm here to put out fire, not to add fuel.

300
00:16:34,784 --> 00:16:35,814
Hey.

301
00:16:36,514 --> 00:16:38,284
Beom Soo.

302
00:16:38,284 --> 00:16:40,154
Hi, Ha Ni.

303
00:16:40,154 --> 00:16:41,794
It's been a while.

304
00:16:41,794 --> 00:16:43,154
Have you been well?

305
00:16:43,594 --> 00:16:46,524
I have to go to a funeral now.

306
00:16:46,564 --> 00:16:48,164
Can you babysit Ha Ni for a while?

307
00:16:48,264 --> 00:16:51,034
- Of course. I'll look after her. - Thank you.

308
00:16:51,234 --> 00:16:53,134
Ha Ni, come here.

309
00:16:53,134 --> 00:16:54,734
There you are.

310
00:17:00,504 --> 00:17:01,514
What's with him?

311
00:17:02,374 --> 00:17:03,444
I don't know.

312
00:17:05,084 --> 00:17:06,144
Ha Ni.

313
00:17:10,214 --> 00:17:11,584
I'm home.

314
00:17:12,154 --> 00:17:14,024
- You're home. - Yes.

315
00:17:14,024 --> 00:17:15,094
Hey!

316
00:17:15,654 --> 00:17:16,924
Is she Professor Oh's baby?

317
00:17:17,794 --> 00:17:18,864
Yes.

318
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:21,534
He had to go to a funeral,

319
00:17:21,534 --> 00:17:22,734
so I'm babysitting her.

320
00:17:22,964 --> 00:17:24,934
He will come to pick her up later tonight.

321
00:17:25,434 --> 00:17:27,164
Her name is Ha Ni, isn't it?

322
00:17:27,564 --> 00:17:30,634
Yes, it is. She's Oh Ha Ni.

323
00:17:31,574 --> 00:17:33,274
Ha Ni, come here.

324
00:17:33,374 --> 00:17:34,574
All right.

325
00:17:35,644 --> 00:17:38,214
Hey, you're here.

326
00:17:38,584 --> 00:17:40,014
Do you like me?

327
00:17:42,484 --> 00:17:44,484
I'll take care of her. You can go and change.

328
00:17:44,654 --> 00:17:45,724
Thanks.

329
00:17:46,454 --> 00:17:48,494
I'll be right back, Ha Ni.

330
00:17:48,994 --> 00:17:50,954
My gosh. She waves goodbye.

331
00:17:51,154 --> 00:17:52,294
How sweet.

332
00:17:53,294 --> 00:17:54,624
Where is she going?

333
00:17:54,624 --> 00:17:57,234
Did you say bye to her? Did you wave at her?

334
00:17:57,864 --> 00:17:59,564
Where? She went there?

335
00:18:14,014 --> 00:18:15,544
I brought warm milk.

336
00:18:16,114 --> 00:18:17,484
Get up and drink some.

337
00:18:18,114 --> 00:18:19,684
I don't want to.

338
00:18:20,784 --> 00:18:23,454
You haven't eaten anything all day.

339
00:18:24,524 --> 00:18:26,324
Just drink a little.

340
00:18:46,674 --> 00:18:49,114
Your dad's sitting in a dark cave.

341
00:18:51,554 --> 00:18:53,154
I can't drink anything.

342
00:18:58,494 --> 00:19:00,224
I saw Professor Oh today.

343
00:19:02,864 --> 00:19:06,564
He said he thought that Dad loved us so much, he felt like...

344
00:19:08,104 --> 00:19:10,604
he'd crumble if he saw either of us,

345
00:19:12,474 --> 00:19:14,744
and so he was too scared to see you.

346
00:19:20,374 --> 00:19:23,084
He said such mean things and he wasn't kind,

347
00:19:24,684 --> 00:19:25,954
but he always tried to do...

348
00:19:26,814 --> 00:19:29,954
what he thought was best for you and me.

349
00:19:33,324 --> 00:19:35,194
He grew up poor,

350
00:19:36,464 --> 00:19:38,134
so he trembled around money.

351
00:19:39,934 --> 00:19:41,964
He got too greedy when it came to business,

352
00:19:42,704 --> 00:19:43,834
but when I think about it,

353
00:19:45,404 --> 00:19:46,934
he was a good husband...

354
00:19:47,674 --> 00:19:49,304
and a kind dad.

355
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:55,714
I'm ashamed...

356
00:19:57,044 --> 00:20:00,014
and guilty that I lied to him for 30 years.

357
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:03,994
When he wouldn't let it go, I got angry and wanted to retaliate,

358
00:20:04,954 --> 00:20:06,924
and so I asked for a divorce.

359
00:20:09,224 --> 00:20:12,294
I think that was going too far.

360
00:20:21,704 --> 00:20:25,044
I'm sure Dad knows how you feel.

361
00:20:32,184 --> 00:20:33,814
Will you visit him tomorrow?

362
00:20:34,584 --> 00:20:36,824
Yes, I should.

363
00:20:38,354 --> 00:20:39,924
Even if he won't see me,

364
00:20:40,724 --> 00:20:42,564
if he hears I came to see him,

365
00:20:42,564 --> 00:20:44,694
that should comfort him a bit.

366
00:20:45,694 --> 00:20:46,794
Right?

367
00:20:47,804 --> 00:20:48,834
Yes.

368
00:21:19,794 --> 00:21:22,304
Bom. Didn't you go home?

369
00:21:23,664 --> 00:21:25,204
I left,

370
00:21:25,204 --> 00:21:28,444
but I thought of you and decided to come back.

371
00:21:31,514 --> 00:21:32,844
Here's a caramel macchiato.

372
00:21:39,014 --> 00:21:42,824
I added two pumps of syrup, so it's extra sweet.

373
00:21:45,454 --> 00:21:47,724
When the sweetness numbs your tongue,

374
00:21:47,724 --> 00:21:49,194
it numbs your brain too,

375
00:21:49,594 --> 00:21:52,534
and it makes the world seem sweeter for a while.

376
00:21:55,704 --> 00:21:56,704
Thank you.

377
00:22:03,474 --> 00:22:04,474
How is it?

378
00:22:07,244 --> 00:22:10,014
I think it numbed my tongue and brain at the same time.

379
00:22:14,054 --> 00:22:17,124
You're worried about your birth mother, aren't you?

380
00:22:19,394 --> 00:22:20,824
And Se Ri too.

381
00:22:23,324 --> 00:22:26,594
I never imagined that her father would be detained.

382
00:22:27,264 --> 00:22:29,934
And knowing it's because he got someone...

383
00:22:29,934 --> 00:22:32,504
to make a fake video to harm your family business...

384
00:22:33,504 --> 00:22:34,774
It's shocking.

385
00:22:37,174 --> 00:22:39,174
When I think of the brewery,

386
00:22:39,174 --> 00:22:40,714
I think he deserves to be punished,

387
00:22:41,984 --> 00:22:45,314
but for Se Ri, Beom Soo, and my mother's sake,

388
00:22:45,314 --> 00:22:46,684
I want him to be released.

389
00:22:50,024 --> 00:22:53,354
To be honest, I don't know what to think.

390
00:23:04,004 --> 00:23:05,874
Ha Ni, the new diaper...

391
00:23:05,874 --> 00:23:08,204
is nice and dry and feels much better, doesn't it?

392
00:23:09,504 --> 00:23:10,604
Isn't it nice?

393
00:23:11,144 --> 00:23:12,574
Ha Ni, where's your nose?

394
00:23:13,744 --> 00:23:14,844
Ha Ni, your nose.

395
00:23:15,214 --> 00:23:16,284
Here it is.

396
00:23:17,414 --> 00:23:19,514
Hello. Wave your hands.

397
00:23:19,514 --> 00:23:21,854
Shall we clap them? That's it.

398
00:23:24,594 --> 00:23:27,254
You're good with babies.

399
00:23:27,424 --> 00:23:30,394
I am. I realized that today.

400
00:23:30,394 --> 00:23:32,734
I'm good at looking after kids.

401
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:38,134
When Gyeol and Bom were young,

402
00:23:38,134 --> 00:23:39,974
I was busy with work...

403
00:23:39,974 --> 00:23:42,274
and I don't even remember holding them.

404
00:23:42,944 --> 00:23:45,744
Seeing a baby after a long while brought back memories...

405
00:23:45,744 --> 00:23:47,274
and it's great.

406
00:23:53,884 --> 00:23:54,884
How about...

407
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:57,594
we have a baby?

408
00:23:58,494 --> 00:23:59,524
What?

409
00:23:59,694 --> 00:24:03,294
I think I'd be so happy to have a daughter...

410
00:24:03,294 --> 00:24:05,064
that looks like you.

411
00:24:06,234 --> 00:24:08,404
You talked about conception dreams this morning.

412
00:24:08,404 --> 00:24:11,134
You've been weird all day long.

413
00:24:11,134 --> 00:24:12,734
I'm not being weird.

414
00:24:12,734 --> 00:24:14,804
Give it some serious thought.

415
00:24:15,574 --> 00:24:18,714
Just a few days ago, you said you weren't interested.

416
00:24:19,914 --> 00:24:23,244
That was because you freaked out at the topic.

417
00:24:23,244 --> 00:24:25,984
There was no way I could say what I wanted.

418
00:24:28,024 --> 00:24:31,254
How could we possibly have a baby at our age?

419
00:24:32,094 --> 00:24:35,564
Men older than me become dads.

420
00:24:35,864 --> 00:24:37,564
I'm not that old.

421
00:24:38,134 --> 00:24:40,434
There's no guarantee we'll get pregnant...

422
00:24:40,434 --> 00:24:42,364
because other couples our age do.

423
00:24:43,664 --> 00:24:46,074
Even if we can get pregnant,

424
00:24:46,074 --> 00:24:48,004
I'm not sure if my body can take it...

425
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:51,174
or if the baby will be healthy.

426
00:24:51,314 --> 00:24:54,614
You're still young enough, Kwang Sook.

427
00:24:54,844 --> 00:24:56,614
If I get pregnant at my age,

428
00:24:56,614 --> 00:24:57,714
premature birth, high blood pressure,

429
00:24:57,714 --> 00:25:00,254
and diabetes are all possible risks.

430
00:25:00,254 --> 00:25:02,324
There are tests for that,

431
00:25:02,324 --> 00:25:03,984
and doctors will advise us.

432
00:25:03,984 --> 00:25:05,694
Don't get worked up about it already.

433
00:25:06,154 --> 00:25:08,024
There are older parents out there,

434
00:25:08,024 --> 00:25:11,094
but do you know how old we'll be when our child starts school?

435
00:25:11,864 --> 00:25:14,904
Would they even like having old parents?

436
00:25:14,904 --> 00:25:16,464
People live to be 100 now.

437
00:25:17,234 --> 00:25:20,034
We can make up for our age.

438
00:25:21,204 --> 00:25:22,404
Don't be silly.

439
00:25:22,674 --> 00:25:24,844
I shouldn't have brought Ha Ni over.

440
00:25:26,944 --> 00:25:28,044
I'm home.

441
00:25:29,084 --> 00:25:30,984
Welcome home.

442
00:25:30,984 --> 00:25:32,914
Did you have dinner?

443
00:25:32,914 --> 00:25:34,684
Yes, with my clinic staff.

444
00:25:35,324 --> 00:25:37,184
Whose baby is that?

445
00:25:39,324 --> 00:25:41,724
That's Ha Ni, Beom Soo's daughter.

446
00:25:42,294 --> 00:25:43,964
Oh, I see.

447
00:25:44,294 --> 00:25:46,594
What do you think, Gyeol?

448
00:25:46,764 --> 00:25:47,764
About what?

449
00:25:47,934 --> 00:25:50,934
Speak objectively as a doctor and not as a son.

450
00:25:51,534 --> 00:25:52,774
Don't you think...

451
00:25:53,534 --> 00:25:56,644
I qualify more than enough to become a dad again?

452
00:25:56,804 --> 00:25:57,814
What?

453
00:25:59,244 --> 00:26:01,014
Will you stop it?

454
00:26:03,014 --> 00:26:04,414
What's wrong with you?

455
00:26:08,854 --> 00:26:12,394
I suggested we try for a baby and she freaked out.

456
00:26:13,324 --> 00:26:15,164
What do you think, Gyeol?

457
00:26:16,594 --> 00:26:18,894
I think it's quite possible,

458
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:22,034
but shouldn't you see an OBGYN for a checkup first?

459
00:26:22,464 --> 00:26:23,834
We should, right?

460
00:26:27,744 --> 00:26:29,004
We should, right?

461
00:26:36,614 --> 00:26:37,714
About today.

462
00:26:39,284 --> 00:26:41,024
You were in the wrong, Ok Bun.

463
00:26:41,424 --> 00:26:42,424
What?

464
00:26:42,424 --> 00:26:44,524
If the housework was too much,

465
00:26:44,524 --> 00:26:46,654
you should've come to Mi Sun first.

466
00:26:47,294 --> 00:26:49,894
Hiring someone and letting them in without consent...

467
00:26:50,494 --> 00:26:53,134
shows you have no respect for hierarchy or order.

468
00:27:03,974 --> 00:27:05,144
Ok Bun is pregnant...

469
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:08,044
and that counts as a special circumstance.

470
00:27:09,014 --> 00:27:10,684
Her morning sickness...

471
00:27:10,684 --> 00:27:13,414
prevents her from having a normal life.

472
00:27:13,784 --> 00:27:16,584
Hiring someone to help with the chores...

473
00:27:17,054 --> 00:27:19,324
doesn't mean she looks down on anyone.

474
00:27:19,324 --> 00:27:21,394
She made a choice based on her will to survive.

475
00:27:21,564 --> 00:27:22,894
That's what I think.

476
00:27:24,024 --> 00:27:25,194
That's right.

477
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:33,774
"I'm sorry. I didn't think it through."

478
00:27:33,774 --> 00:27:36,244
"I will discuss with you first from now on."

479
00:27:36,244 --> 00:27:37,974
That could be the end of it.

480
00:27:37,974 --> 00:27:39,314
Why are you...

481
00:27:39,314 --> 00:27:41,614
making excuses to justify what she did?

482
00:27:43,884 --> 00:27:45,684
You can't say that.

483
00:27:45,954 --> 00:27:47,784
Are you that old-fashioned?

484
00:27:48,684 --> 00:27:50,524
- I'm old-fashioned? - Just because you're older,

485
00:27:50,524 --> 00:27:52,794
you demand respect and expect others to grovel.

486
00:27:52,794 --> 00:27:54,794
That's what geezers do.

487
00:27:55,994 --> 00:27:58,034
How can you talk like that to me?

488
00:27:58,364 --> 00:28:00,234
Will you calm down?

489
00:28:00,234 --> 00:28:01,834
How can I calm down?

490
00:28:01,834 --> 00:28:03,304
He called me a geezer.

491
00:28:03,304 --> 00:28:06,234
That really upset you, didn't it? You have a guilty conscience.

492
00:28:07,204 --> 00:28:08,274
Stop it, Heung Soo.

493
00:28:08,274 --> 00:28:09,474
Whatever!

494
00:28:09,474 --> 00:28:11,874
If this is how it'll be, we'll move out.

495
00:28:12,344 --> 00:28:13,544
- You'll move out? - You'll move out?

496
00:28:15,014 --> 00:28:16,144
Are you insane?

497
00:28:16,684 --> 00:28:18,954
I can't live in such an overbearing atmosphere.

498
00:28:18,954 --> 00:28:21,324
I'm an artist!

499
00:28:23,984 --> 00:28:25,324
Let's talk in our room.

500
00:28:25,394 --> 00:28:26,454
Hurry.

501
00:28:26,654 --> 00:28:28,294
We'll move out.

502
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:29,694
You will?

503
00:28:29,694 --> 00:28:31,634
Do you think I'll stop you? Move out.

504
00:28:31,634 --> 00:28:33,594
This is so out of character for you.

505
00:28:33,594 --> 00:28:34,834
Calm down.

506
00:28:34,834 --> 00:28:35,964
How can I calm down...

507
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:37,904
when my younger brother took that tone with me?

508
00:28:38,534 --> 00:28:40,274
The older sibling should take the high road.

509
00:28:40,274 --> 00:28:42,044
Relax and hold back.

510
00:28:42,044 --> 00:28:43,544
What's wrong with you?

511
00:28:44,104 --> 00:28:45,174
Forget it!

512
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,014
Move out, why don't you?

513
00:28:48,044 --> 00:28:49,414
Unbelievable.

514
00:28:52,754 --> 00:28:54,214
Darn it.

515
00:28:56,724 --> 00:28:57,724
Goodness.

516
00:28:58,294 --> 00:28:59,754
We were supposed to talk things out...

517
00:28:59,754 --> 00:29:01,764
with your brother and Mi Sun to clear the air.

518
00:29:02,124 --> 00:29:03,794
How could you escalate things like that...

519
00:29:03,794 --> 00:29:04,894
and say we're moving out?

520
00:29:05,934 --> 00:29:08,034
I meant it. Let's move out.

521
00:29:09,604 --> 00:29:12,304
If you want to move out, do so on your own.

522
00:29:12,934 --> 00:29:13,934
What?

523
00:29:14,134 --> 00:29:17,374
I'll live here with your brothers and Mi Sun,

524
00:29:17,544 --> 00:29:20,114
so move out on your own.

525
00:29:20,474 --> 00:29:22,184
Are you serious?

526
00:29:22,184 --> 00:29:23,444
Of course, I am.

527
00:29:26,414 --> 00:29:28,454
I'm staying right here.

528
00:29:34,924 --> 00:29:36,064
Unbelievable.

529
00:29:56,844 --> 00:29:58,914
Do you need something?

530
00:30:00,814 --> 00:30:01,954
It's not that.

531
00:30:05,524 --> 00:30:07,894
I'm sorry, Mi Sun.

532
00:30:11,964 --> 00:30:15,604
I should've discussed it with you before hiring a housekeeper.

533
00:30:16,734 --> 00:30:19,204
That was inconsiderate of me.

534
00:30:26,874 --> 00:30:27,914
Ok Bun.

535
00:30:29,914 --> 00:30:32,154
I tried hard not to be,

536
00:30:34,084 --> 00:30:35,354
but I guess...

537
00:30:36,724 --> 00:30:38,724
I've been unintentionally jealous of you.

538
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:42,724
What?

539
00:30:45,764 --> 00:30:46,964
You see,

540
00:30:49,234 --> 00:30:50,234
I can't get pregnant.

541
00:30:55,244 --> 00:30:56,274
Mi Sun...

542
00:30:58,174 --> 00:31:02,014
That's actually the main reason my first husband and I ended things.

543
00:31:04,314 --> 00:31:06,714
But seeing you happy and expecting a child so soon...

544
00:31:06,714 --> 00:31:08,584
right after the wedding...

545
00:31:10,454 --> 00:31:12,254
turned me into a fool.

546
00:31:12,854 --> 00:31:15,524
I guess I got really jealous, and I'm sorry about that.

547
00:31:19,664 --> 00:31:21,564
I had no idea.

548
00:31:25,304 --> 00:31:27,504
Mi Sun, I'm sorry.

549
00:31:27,874 --> 00:31:29,944
No, you did nothing wrong.

550
00:31:30,644 --> 00:31:32,844
I'm the older one and shouldn't have gotten jealous.

551
00:31:32,844 --> 00:31:34,314
It was petty of me.

552
00:31:34,614 --> 00:31:37,244
No, I'm the one who's sorry.

553
00:31:37,244 --> 00:31:39,014
It's all my fault.

554
00:31:40,854 --> 00:31:41,854
Goodness.

555
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:45,094
Don't apologize.

556
00:31:46,054 --> 00:31:47,694
I'm sorry, but it's okay now.

557
00:31:47,694 --> 00:31:49,594
I've made peace with it,

558
00:31:49,594 --> 00:31:50,964
so don't cry.

559
00:31:54,434 --> 00:31:56,464
Goodness. I'm sorry.

560
00:32:00,304 --> 00:32:02,374
- I think they made up. Yes. - Really?

561
00:32:03,644 --> 00:32:04,744
- Chun Soo. - Yes?

562
00:32:04,774 --> 00:32:08,444
You put on a great show with that hand stomp of yours.

563
00:32:09,284 --> 00:32:10,614
- Was I great? - Yes.

564
00:32:11,954 --> 00:32:15,054
You called me a narrow-minded geezer out of the blue.

565
00:32:15,654 --> 00:32:16,924
- It struck a nerve. - Really?

566
00:32:16,924 --> 00:32:17,984
- Yes. - I see.

567
00:32:18,494 --> 00:32:20,154
I'm home.

568
00:32:20,454 --> 00:32:22,294
Hey, you're home.

569
00:32:22,764 --> 00:32:24,124
What are you two whispering about?

570
00:32:24,224 --> 00:32:27,894
Call it comradeship between two married men...

571
00:32:27,994 --> 00:32:29,104
or something like that.

572
00:32:30,164 --> 00:32:31,734
Since you're not married yet,

573
00:32:32,304 --> 00:32:34,274
- you wouldn't know. - He wouldn't.

574
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:36,674
- Didn't I seal the deal? - Yes, with that hand stomp.

575
00:32:36,874 --> 00:32:38,214
- We'll do that again in the future. - Sure.

576
00:32:41,314 --> 00:32:43,114
Did everything go well at the funeral?

577
00:32:43,114 --> 00:32:45,784
Yes, thanks to you, I could pay my respects without worrying.

578
00:32:45,884 --> 00:32:47,184
I bet it was a hassle watching Ha Ni.

579
00:32:47,184 --> 00:32:50,554
Don't get me started. I couldn't even get near her.

580
00:32:50,824 --> 00:32:53,724
Look at him. He's still hogging her.

581
00:32:55,094 --> 00:32:57,264
How is your daughter this adorable?

582
00:32:57,264 --> 00:33:00,194
She's like an angel with these big eyes.

583
00:33:01,064 --> 00:33:03,434
I'll be picturing her smile for days.

584
00:33:05,334 --> 00:33:08,044
He can't get enough of her.

585
00:33:08,274 --> 00:33:10,274
You must love babies.

586
00:33:11,204 --> 00:33:14,514
I was exceptionally busy when Bom and Gyeol were babies,

587
00:33:14,574 --> 00:33:16,484
so I was barely around to care for them.

588
00:33:17,214 --> 00:33:19,884
I know I'd be able to raise a child well if I had one,

589
00:33:20,314 --> 00:33:22,584
but your sister-in-law is totally against it.

590
00:33:22,884 --> 00:33:26,054
We can't be selfish and should think about the child.

591
00:33:26,054 --> 00:33:28,464
When the child starts kindergarten and elementary school,

592
00:33:28,524 --> 00:33:30,964
most other children will come with their young parents.

593
00:33:31,124 --> 00:33:33,964
Our child won't be happy being the only one whose parents...

594
00:33:34,064 --> 00:33:35,634
look old enough to be grandparents.

595
00:33:35,864 --> 00:33:38,374
How can you be so selfish?

596
00:33:38,534 --> 00:33:40,434
These days, many parents have children...

597
00:33:40,434 --> 00:33:42,344
and raise them at an older age.

598
00:33:42,444 --> 00:33:44,204
That's not something you should worry about.

599
00:33:44,304 --> 00:33:45,444
Right?

600
00:33:45,644 --> 00:33:47,274
What did I tell you?

601
00:33:47,344 --> 00:33:48,414
That only works...

602
00:33:48,414 --> 00:33:51,084
if the child has older siblings to help out.

603
00:33:51,384 --> 00:33:54,214
Bom and Gyeol will be married soon,

604
00:33:54,514 --> 00:33:56,684
leaving our child to grow up alone.

605
00:33:57,384 --> 00:33:58,894
There's Ha Ni,

606
00:33:58,924 --> 00:34:01,154
and Heung Soo's child will soon be born.

607
00:34:01,154 --> 00:34:03,364
We could raise them all like siblings.

608
00:34:03,524 --> 00:34:04,564
Of course.

609
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:05,934
We're in an aging society now,

610
00:34:05,934 --> 00:34:07,394
yet we feel and live younger than our age.

611
00:34:07,394 --> 00:34:08,634
It'll be good to have a child.

612
00:34:09,104 --> 00:34:11,364
Besides, with Dong Seok's background,

613
00:34:11,834 --> 00:34:13,574
the child will have a good upbringing.

614
00:34:14,104 --> 00:34:16,274
Maybe you should be open to the idea...

615
00:34:16,274 --> 00:34:17,344
Don't be ridiculous.

616
00:34:17,344 --> 00:34:19,314
This topic is now off-limits.

617
00:34:19,714 --> 00:34:21,374
Says who?

618
00:34:21,484 --> 00:34:23,784
Says me, of course.

619
00:34:24,744 --> 00:34:25,814
See?

620
00:34:26,184 --> 00:34:28,924
That's how stubborn your sister-in-law is.

621
00:34:30,354 --> 00:34:31,424
See?

622
00:34:31,524 --> 00:34:34,424
He can be like a five-year-old when he throws a tantrum.

623
00:34:37,624 --> 00:34:38,634
Ha Ni.

624
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,664
Why don't you stay the night?

625
00:34:47,034 --> 00:34:48,844
Did you smile?

626
00:34:55,484 --> 00:34:56,644
What's this?

627
00:34:57,614 --> 00:34:59,684
Don't cross this line.

628
00:35:01,784 --> 00:35:04,684
What on earth is this?

629
00:35:05,624 --> 00:35:07,494
It's all because...

630
00:35:07,494 --> 00:35:09,994
you keep pushing this nonsense about having a child.

631
00:35:10,264 --> 00:35:12,094
You heard the others earlier.

632
00:35:12,094 --> 00:35:13,864
Even Gyeol's on board.

633
00:35:13,994 --> 00:35:16,204
Would your sweet son oppose it...

634
00:35:16,204 --> 00:35:18,204
knowing this is your wish?

635
00:35:18,204 --> 00:35:19,704
In my earlier years,

636
00:35:20,504 --> 00:35:23,274
I was so focused on growing my company...

637
00:35:23,274 --> 00:35:25,214
that I can't even remember...

638
00:35:25,444 --> 00:35:27,674
the sweet early days of my children.

639
00:35:28,174 --> 00:35:31,084
I finally want to be a father again.

640
00:35:31,344 --> 00:35:33,384
Is it really so hard to grant me this small wish?

641
00:35:33,914 --> 00:35:36,724
How can you say that when you'll be a grandpa...

642
00:35:36,924 --> 00:35:39,224
once Bom and Gyeol get married?

643
00:35:39,624 --> 00:35:42,524
Enjoy the fun of caring for your grandchildren.

644
00:35:42,924 --> 00:35:44,794
I'd be happy to help raise...

645
00:35:44,824 --> 00:35:47,864
Bom's and Gyeol's children if they ask me to.

646
00:35:47,864 --> 00:35:50,064
But I... Unbelievable.

647
00:35:50,364 --> 00:35:53,104
I want a child of our own,

648
00:35:53,334 --> 00:35:56,344
so why are you insisting that I care for my grandchildren instead?

649
00:35:56,574 --> 00:35:58,774
It makes me feel like an elderly man...

650
00:35:58,774 --> 00:36:00,314
in his final years.

651
00:36:01,884 --> 00:36:04,984
I know I can still do this.

652
00:36:05,684 --> 00:36:06,884
Besides, don't you remember...

653
00:36:06,884 --> 00:36:09,224
the physical exam given by your brothers-in-law?

654
00:36:09,254 --> 00:36:11,284
I succeeded on my first try.

655
00:36:11,484 --> 00:36:14,194
Unbelievable. How are they the same?

656
00:36:14,194 --> 00:36:15,794
What makes it any different?

657
00:36:15,864 --> 00:36:17,094
Whatever.

658
00:36:17,264 --> 00:36:19,634
I'm going to bed, so hands off.

659
00:36:22,164 --> 00:36:24,664
Kwang Sook, come on.

660
00:36:25,634 --> 00:36:27,874
I won't kiss you for calling my name like that.

661
00:36:27,974 --> 00:36:29,644
That's against the rule.

662
00:36:30,944 --> 00:36:34,174
You're the one who played dirty first!

663
00:36:55,864 --> 00:36:56,964
Hello?

664
00:36:57,764 --> 00:36:59,904
I just got home from attending the funeral.

665
00:37:00,504 --> 00:37:01,744
How's your mother?

666
00:37:02,774 --> 00:37:05,414
She barely managed to drink a glass of milk.

667
00:37:06,814 --> 00:37:07,914
I'm worried.

668
00:37:08,714 --> 00:37:09,844
How are you, Se Ri?

669
00:37:10,844 --> 00:37:13,454
I've tried to stay strong in front of my mom,

670
00:37:14,614 --> 00:37:16,054
but the tears won't stop.

671
00:37:18,054 --> 00:37:19,554
It's hard to even take a sip of water...

672
00:37:21,124 --> 00:37:23,424
when I think about what my dad's going through.

673
00:37:26,734 --> 00:37:29,264
I feel terrible that I can't be...

674
00:37:29,504 --> 00:37:30,934
of any help to you.

675
00:37:32,534 --> 00:37:33,904
That's how I feel.

676
00:38:14,474 --> 00:38:16,414
(Eagle Brewery)

677
00:38:40,634 --> 00:38:43,074
(Application for Divorce)

678
00:38:44,844 --> 00:38:45,844
Honey.

679
00:38:45,844 --> 00:38:47,674
You said you wanted to divorce me.

680
00:38:49,814 --> 00:38:51,914
You know they grant wishes even for the dead.

681
00:38:52,714 --> 00:38:55,424
I guess I should grant a wish for someone alive at least once.

682
00:38:56,154 --> 00:38:58,694
Is something wrong with you?

683
00:38:59,794 --> 00:39:00,894
Why are you being like this?

684
00:39:01,494 --> 00:39:03,624
You said your wish was to divorce me.

685
00:39:04,324 --> 00:39:07,194
I'm granting your wish. What's your problem?

686
00:39:07,894 --> 00:39:09,634
Don't nitpick.

687
00:39:09,804 --> 00:39:12,134
It's just so sudden.

688
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:17,574
Are you curious if I'm planning to die or something?

689
00:39:49,477 --> 00:39:51,717
(A month later)

690
00:39:52,555 --> 00:39:54,685
The thing is...

691
00:39:56,925 --> 00:39:57,955
About the petition.

692
00:40:00,425 --> 00:40:01,695
Let's just write one and turn it in.

693
00:40:03,365 --> 00:40:04,435
Are you serious?

694
00:40:05,035 --> 00:40:06,065
Yes.

695
00:40:06,735 --> 00:40:08,235
If you ask me...

696
00:40:08,235 --> 00:40:09,865
why I'd write a petition for someone who hasn't even apologized,

697
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:10,935
I have nothing to say.

698
00:40:12,135 --> 00:40:14,235
But I still think we should forgive him first...

699
00:40:14,945 --> 00:40:16,475
for the sake...

700
00:40:17,575 --> 00:40:19,875
of Beom Soo, Kang Soo, and Se Ri.

701
00:40:24,385 --> 00:40:26,015
You made a tough decision.

702
00:40:27,255 --> 00:40:29,555
To be honest, I wanted to say the same thing.

703
00:40:30,025 --> 00:40:32,095
But I didn't think it was my place to meddle,

704
00:40:32,725 --> 00:40:33,995
so I didn't say anything.

705
00:40:35,125 --> 00:40:36,595
My brothers also agree with me.

706
00:40:38,995 --> 00:40:41,005
It's not for Dokgo Tak.

707
00:40:41,535 --> 00:40:43,805
Let's think that it is for your brothers...

708
00:40:44,905 --> 00:40:47,305
and write the petition.

709
00:40:48,005 --> 00:40:50,705
Okay. I'll do that.

710
00:41:22,205 --> 00:41:23,845
Do you know how dumbfounded I was...

711
00:41:24,005 --> 00:41:26,215
when I heard you were here to see me?

712
00:41:30,085 --> 00:41:31,815
You've refused your wife's visitation for a month,

713
00:41:32,915 --> 00:41:35,285
but you didn't turn me away.

714
00:41:37,795 --> 00:41:39,525
I just came because I found it too ridiculous.

715
00:41:40,595 --> 00:41:41,925
Why did you want to see me?

716
00:41:42,565 --> 00:41:45,195
Did you come here just to see...

717
00:41:45,195 --> 00:41:47,635
how far I've fallen from grace?

718
00:41:48,605 --> 00:41:51,475
Se Ri was nervous and worried about you, so I came in her stead.

719
00:41:53,775 --> 00:41:56,445
For some reason, I thought you wouldn't refuse my visitation.

720
00:42:05,715 --> 00:42:06,755
Se Ri...

721
00:42:09,325 --> 00:42:10,325
Is she doing well?

722
00:42:10,885 --> 00:42:12,125
How could she be doing well?

723
00:42:16,465 --> 00:42:19,335
If you ever treat her like a criminal's daughter,

724
00:42:19,335 --> 00:42:20,335
I won't let you get away with it.

725
00:42:21,465 --> 00:42:23,935
I've raised her with the greatest care and love.

726
00:42:24,305 --> 00:42:25,535
I will never do that.

727
00:42:25,535 --> 00:42:27,275
You have a daughter, so you know how I feel.

728
00:42:27,275 --> 00:42:29,005
You know what a daughter means to a dad.

729
00:42:31,515 --> 00:42:33,575
Sure. I'm well aware of that.

730
00:42:34,075 --> 00:42:37,115
Right? Make sure to get your act together!

731
00:42:43,485 --> 00:42:45,755
I came here to tell you something.

732
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:49,365
You know,

733
00:42:50,995 --> 00:42:53,995
I'll be sure to get you out of the detention center.

734
00:42:59,675 --> 00:43:00,675
What?

735
00:43:01,035 --> 00:43:02,075
I will get you out...

736
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:04,975
and make you come...

737
00:43:04,975 --> 00:43:08,015
to our brewery and apologize to my family on your knees.

738
00:43:09,885 --> 00:43:10,915
My goodness.

739
00:43:13,285 --> 00:43:14,625
That's ridiculous.

740
00:43:17,525 --> 00:43:19,655
You are really something.

741
00:43:24,565 --> 00:43:26,695
So please take good care of your health...

742
00:43:27,295 --> 00:43:28,565
and stay safe.

743
00:43:37,675 --> 00:43:39,945
When you visited to see him,

744
00:43:40,145 --> 00:43:42,145
he agreed to see you?

745
00:43:43,545 --> 00:43:44,585
Yes.

746
00:43:46,015 --> 00:43:47,655
He refused every time I went there.

747
00:43:48,255 --> 00:43:50,285
But he went to see you?

748
00:43:51,495 --> 00:43:52,495
My gosh.

749
00:43:52,625 --> 00:43:56,395
He probably didn't want you to see him struggling there.

750
00:43:58,565 --> 00:43:59,965
How did Dad look?

751
00:44:00,665 --> 00:44:02,035
He seemed quite healthy.

752
00:44:02,735 --> 00:44:05,805
He looked a lot calmer and gentler than before.

753
00:44:06,875 --> 00:44:07,945
Are you sure?

754
00:44:08,075 --> 00:44:09,075
Yes.

755
00:44:09,075 --> 00:44:11,315
He seemed to be accepting the reality.

756
00:44:13,345 --> 00:44:16,315
I'm a little relieved that he met you.

757
00:44:17,115 --> 00:44:19,355
Thank you for going all the way there.

758
00:44:19,815 --> 00:44:20,815
It's no big deal.

759
00:44:21,555 --> 00:44:24,755
And there's one more thing I want to tell you.

760
00:44:27,325 --> 00:44:28,725
Eagle Brewery...

761
00:44:29,265 --> 00:44:32,535
will write a petition for Mr. Dokgo's commutation.

762
00:44:34,135 --> 00:44:35,535
Are you serious?

763
00:44:35,535 --> 00:44:36,865
I can't believe this.

764
00:44:38,005 --> 00:44:39,975
Kwang Sook and my family...

765
00:44:39,975 --> 00:44:42,275
decided to write it for Se Ri...

766
00:44:42,275 --> 00:44:43,845
and Kang Soo.

767
00:44:46,375 --> 00:44:47,415
Thank you.

768
00:44:50,045 --> 00:44:51,355
Thank you so much.

769
00:44:52,715 --> 00:44:54,725
I don't know what to do to repay your kindness.

770
00:44:56,125 --> 00:44:57,125
But...

771
00:44:58,125 --> 00:45:00,395
I have a favor to ask.

772
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:05,595
Now that my family has decided to forgive Mr. Dokgo,

773
00:45:05,595 --> 00:45:07,335
I'll take a load off my mind...

774
00:45:08,105 --> 00:45:11,435
and help him by doing what I can during the trial.

775
00:45:14,105 --> 00:45:15,375
If you do that,

776
00:45:16,105 --> 00:45:18,645
we will feel like we've gained a thousand troops.

777
00:45:21,045 --> 00:45:22,115
So, Ms. Jang,

778
00:45:22,715 --> 00:45:25,315
we can't let a consulting lawyer handle the case alone.

779
00:45:25,755 --> 00:45:26,985
We should hire experts with experience...

780
00:45:26,985 --> 00:45:29,025
in corporate criminal investigations and trials...

781
00:45:29,025 --> 00:45:31,555
and let them leap more aggressively to his legal defense.

782
00:45:33,695 --> 00:45:36,265
Okay. Let's do that.

783
00:45:38,435 --> 00:45:39,935
Thank you, Professor Oh.

784
00:45:46,105 --> 00:45:47,535
I really appreciate it.

785
00:46:05,795 --> 00:46:06,955
Hello, hubby.

786
00:46:07,925 --> 00:46:09,895
My driver is on his way there.

787
00:46:09,895 --> 00:46:11,265
Get in the car and come here once he gets there.

788
00:46:11,565 --> 00:46:14,165
We have something to take care of together.

789
00:46:15,935 --> 00:46:17,565
Something to take care of together?

790
00:46:18,935 --> 00:46:21,375
You'll see once you get here. I'll see you soon.

791
00:46:28,545 --> 00:46:29,685
What would it be?

792
00:46:34,685 --> 00:46:36,485
- Mom. - Hey.

793
00:46:36,485 --> 00:46:37,985
What brings you here? You didn't even call me.

794
00:46:38,225 --> 00:46:40,425
I forgot something when I packed my stuff.

795
00:46:40,425 --> 00:46:41,525
I'm here to pick it up.

796
00:46:43,095 --> 00:46:44,165
What a relief.

797
00:46:44,595 --> 00:46:47,665
I thought you caused trouble at Golden Castle. You scared me.

798
00:46:47,665 --> 00:46:49,035
Why would you worry about me?

799
00:46:49,205 --> 00:46:51,105
I just want you to get along with Dong Seok.

800
00:46:52,035 --> 00:46:53,035
By the way,

801
00:46:54,675 --> 00:46:55,845
where's everyone?

802
00:46:56,345 --> 00:46:59,915
Today is the last day of construction at the workshop,

803
00:46:59,915 --> 00:47:01,385
so they went to check it out.

804
00:47:01,885 --> 00:47:04,085
I see.

805
00:47:06,755 --> 00:47:07,755
Hey.

806
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:14,965
There was no problem with the facilities.

807
00:47:15,425 --> 00:47:17,365
We just found a micro-crack...

808
00:47:17,365 --> 00:47:19,495
on the weld of the cooling tank, so I asked them to take care of it.

809
00:47:19,495 --> 00:47:20,865
Thank you.

810
00:47:26,575 --> 00:47:27,975
I'm here to pick you up.

811
00:47:28,145 --> 00:47:29,975
Okay. I'll be right out.

812
00:47:30,605 --> 00:47:32,245
I have something to take care of,

813
00:47:32,245 --> 00:47:34,175
so I'll be out for a moment.

814
00:47:34,175 --> 00:47:36,045
Will you stay here, Mom?

815
00:47:36,045 --> 00:47:38,315
What? I'll leave soon.

816
00:47:38,315 --> 00:47:39,315
Okay.

817
00:47:39,315 --> 00:47:42,055
(Eagle Brewery)

818
00:47:46,855 --> 00:47:48,695
- See you. - Bye.

819
00:47:58,675 --> 00:47:59,735
What do you want?

820
00:48:01,335 --> 00:48:02,505
I waited...

821
00:48:02,905 --> 00:48:04,945
for you to call after I left.

822
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,945
It has been a month and you haven't.

823
00:48:07,715 --> 00:48:08,945
How could you, Mr. Go?

824
00:48:08,945 --> 00:48:10,215
Do we...

825
00:48:10,685 --> 00:48:13,785
have a special reason to talk?

826
00:48:14,685 --> 00:48:15,685
What?

827
00:48:15,855 --> 00:48:17,655
I gave you a choice.

828
00:48:18,125 --> 00:48:20,095
Go Ja Dong or Golden Castle.

829
00:48:20,725 --> 00:48:22,465
You could choose just one.

830
00:48:23,425 --> 00:48:26,495
Mrs. Gong. You left Go Ja Dong...

831
00:48:27,865 --> 00:48:29,505
and chose Golden Castle.

832
00:48:29,505 --> 00:48:31,105
I didn't leave you.

833
00:48:31,635 --> 00:48:36,445
I chose both you and Golden Castle.

834
00:48:36,475 --> 00:48:38,445
You shouldn't do that!

835
00:48:39,975 --> 00:48:41,485
How can you...

836
00:48:42,915 --> 00:48:44,145
be so selfish?

837
00:48:46,985 --> 00:48:49,685
If that's all, I must get back to work.

838
00:48:50,285 --> 00:48:52,125
Wait. Stop right there.

839
00:48:52,655 --> 00:48:53,755
Mr. Go!

840
00:48:53,955 --> 00:48:55,595
Hey! Go Ja Dong!

841
00:48:59,195 --> 00:49:00,835
He's really angry.

842
00:49:12,975 --> 00:49:15,845
Where are we going?

843
00:49:17,785 --> 00:49:19,715
We're almost there.

844
00:49:24,125 --> 00:49:28,265
(Chamsarang Women's Clinic)

845
00:49:40,475 --> 00:49:41,905
Why are we here?

846
00:49:42,005 --> 00:49:43,845
Let's get checked up.

847
00:49:44,675 --> 00:49:45,775
What?

848
00:49:46,145 --> 00:49:48,385
Instead of being scared and avoiding the issue,

849
00:49:48,445 --> 00:49:50,515
let's ask a doctor if we're even capable...

850
00:49:50,515 --> 00:49:52,155
of having a baby.

851
00:49:53,815 --> 00:49:55,425
I told you that...

852
00:49:55,525 --> 00:49:57,285
I don't want to have a baby.

853
00:49:57,285 --> 00:49:59,095
- Darling. - Hubby.

854
00:49:59,425 --> 00:50:02,495
If you want to get checked up, go on in on your own.

855
00:50:06,035 --> 00:50:08,405
(Chamsarang Women's Clinic)

856
00:50:15,205 --> 00:50:16,745
Ok Bun, try this.

857
00:50:17,075 --> 00:50:18,715
I made some spicy dried squid.

858
00:50:18,915 --> 00:50:20,445
It's what you wanted.

859
00:50:28,015 --> 00:50:30,555
It's sweet and sour and delicious.

860
00:50:31,255 --> 00:50:33,295
I'm glad you like it.

861
00:50:34,455 --> 00:50:35,625
Thanks, Mi Sun.

862
00:50:35,765 --> 00:50:38,225
We'll do the dishes afterward.

863
00:50:42,435 --> 00:50:43,905
- Beom Soo. - Yes?

864
00:50:44,435 --> 00:50:46,705
I put the petition on your desk.

865
00:50:48,775 --> 00:50:50,375
Tell me if anything needs revising.

866
00:50:54,475 --> 00:50:55,585
I will.

867
00:50:58,785 --> 00:50:59,915
Thank you.

868
00:51:00,815 --> 00:51:03,625
We're family. Why would you thank us?

869
00:51:04,725 --> 00:51:07,395
Brothers. Are you home?

870
00:51:08,595 --> 00:51:10,595
I think it's the chairman.

871
00:51:15,705 --> 00:51:16,705
Goodness.

872
00:51:17,535 --> 00:51:18,935
What brings you here?

873
00:51:21,575 --> 00:51:23,245
I'm so frustrated,

874
00:51:23,675 --> 00:51:26,045
I came to you to vent and plead.

875
00:51:30,485 --> 00:51:33,185
I want to have a baby with the woman I love.

876
00:51:33,355 --> 00:51:35,355
Is that too much to ask for and too greedy of me?

877
00:51:35,485 --> 00:51:38,325
No, not at all. It's very natural.

878
00:51:39,155 --> 00:51:41,525
She treats me like I'm a weirdo.

879
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:44,195
It's really hurtful, you know.

880
00:51:44,325 --> 00:51:45,835
It would be.

881
00:51:46,865 --> 00:51:49,265
Kwang Sook went too far this time, didn't she?

882
00:51:50,605 --> 00:51:51,835
Earlier today,

883
00:51:52,005 --> 00:51:54,605
I tried really hard to make the time for the appointment.

884
00:51:54,605 --> 00:51:57,275
She yelled at me outside the clinic and walked off.

885
00:51:57,305 --> 00:51:59,645
Oh, dear. If you'd gone that far,

886
00:51:59,645 --> 00:52:01,515
it wouldn't have hurt to see the doctor.

887
00:52:01,645 --> 00:52:03,115
That's exactly it.

888
00:52:03,215 --> 00:52:06,715
Part of me wonders if she doesn't love me,

889
00:52:06,855 --> 00:52:09,425
and if that's why she doesn't want to have my baby.

890
00:52:09,755 --> 00:52:11,485
That's what I found myself thinking.

891
00:52:11,485 --> 00:52:13,225
- No. - That won't be it.

892
00:52:14,025 --> 00:52:16,065
I know it's not,

893
00:52:16,065 --> 00:52:18,795
but it's so bad, that's how I feel.

894
00:52:18,935 --> 00:52:20,195
You would.

895
00:52:20,795 --> 00:52:24,265
I completely understand where you're coming from.

896
00:52:24,535 --> 00:52:26,575
I support Kwang Sook by default,

897
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:28,945
but on this matter, I support you.

898
00:52:29,175 --> 00:52:32,545
Me too. Just for today, I side with you.

899
00:52:32,915 --> 00:52:33,945
Thanks.

900
00:52:35,385 --> 00:52:38,685
Kwang Sook is usually caring and considerate,

901
00:52:38,785 --> 00:52:40,315
but she let you down this time.

902
00:52:42,755 --> 00:52:45,955
I guess I agree with my brothers.

903
00:52:47,095 --> 00:52:49,365
I feel much better knowing...

904
00:52:49,365 --> 00:52:51,295
you're all on my side.

905
00:52:51,625 --> 00:52:53,535
It's all about force and momentum.

906
00:52:53,695 --> 00:52:54,765
Go for it.

907
00:52:54,765 --> 00:52:57,265
That's it. The first spat as a married couple...

908
00:52:57,335 --> 00:52:59,005
decides the trajectory of the future.

909
00:53:00,035 --> 00:53:02,545
Knowing you four are in my corner,

910
00:53:02,705 --> 00:53:04,345
I won't back out of this fight.

911
00:53:04,805 --> 00:53:07,275
Here's to our brother's victory.

912
00:53:07,415 --> 00:53:08,945
- Cheers! - Cheers!

913
00:53:19,195 --> 00:53:22,295
It looks like the men are in agreement.

914
00:53:23,125 --> 00:53:24,195
Yes.

915
00:53:25,295 --> 00:53:27,265
We should tell Kwang Sook.

916
00:53:28,505 --> 00:53:30,165
- We should. - Yes.

917
00:53:37,845 --> 00:53:40,615
The call cannot be connected. Transferring to voicemail.

918
00:53:40,615 --> 00:53:41,615
Your call may be...

919
00:53:42,245 --> 00:53:44,285
Why won't he pick up?

920
00:53:47,455 --> 00:53:48,525
He's not picking up?

921
00:53:49,455 --> 00:53:50,525
No.

922
00:53:50,785 --> 00:53:53,595
I think he's ticked off about what happened today.

923
00:53:54,455 --> 00:53:57,125
I guess it hurt him a great deal.

924
00:53:58,395 --> 00:54:02,135
Your dad tends to get upset about something trivial.

925
00:54:03,305 --> 00:54:05,205
He is like that.

926
00:54:05,775 --> 00:54:06,805
Right?

927
00:54:08,805 --> 00:54:10,005
Excuse me.

928
00:54:10,675 --> 00:54:12,615
Hi, Mi Sun. What's up?

929
00:54:13,415 --> 00:54:14,445
Kwang Sook.

930
00:54:15,285 --> 00:54:17,385
The chairman's at our place.

931
00:54:18,215 --> 00:54:19,255
What?

932
00:54:19,715 --> 00:54:22,585
What is he doing over there?

933
00:54:23,555 --> 00:54:24,555
Let me.

934
00:54:25,425 --> 00:54:28,125
The guys are talking and they're on the same page.

935
00:54:28,565 --> 00:54:30,965
They're drinking and chewing you out.

936
00:54:32,195 --> 00:54:33,235
He's...

937
00:54:33,465 --> 00:54:35,305
How could he do that?

938
00:54:35,765 --> 00:54:39,505
The chairman pleaded his case so sorrowfully.

939
00:54:39,575 --> 00:54:42,475
Isn't the brewery my home ground?

940
00:54:42,675 --> 00:54:45,045
Why is he playing on my home turf?

941
00:54:47,475 --> 00:54:50,745
Today, it looks like they're all on the chairman's side.

942
00:54:51,345 --> 00:54:53,515
It sounds like they're trying to...

943
00:54:54,085 --> 00:54:55,925
save his life or something.

944
00:54:57,485 --> 00:55:01,195
Why are the Oh men so wishy-washy?

945
00:55:16,305 --> 00:55:17,305
Goodness.

946
00:55:17,845 --> 00:55:19,575
Kwang Sook will be waiting.

947
00:55:19,575 --> 00:55:22,085
Shouldn't you go home now?

948
00:55:23,285 --> 00:55:25,755
You're so good at souring the mood.

949
00:55:26,415 --> 00:55:30,325
If he goes home now, it's as good as game over.

950
00:55:31,895 --> 00:55:33,755
Is that so?

951
00:55:33,855 --> 00:55:35,825
It is so.

952
00:55:36,195 --> 00:55:37,765
On a day like this,

953
00:55:37,895 --> 00:55:41,095
you must show how serious you are by staying out.

954
00:55:41,365 --> 00:55:42,405
Should I?

955
00:55:43,035 --> 00:55:44,765
What do you think, Professor Oh?

956
00:55:45,705 --> 00:55:47,775
I guess I agree.

957
00:55:48,235 --> 00:55:49,875
You can spend the night here.

958
00:55:50,875 --> 00:55:52,045
Can I?

959
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:54,945
If that's what you want, then okay.

960
00:55:55,115 --> 00:55:56,545
I'll stay the night.

961
00:55:57,645 --> 00:56:00,385
I'll sleep with Chun Soo.

962
00:56:01,315 --> 00:56:04,585
I'm a newlywed myself. I can't allow that.

963
00:56:07,695 --> 00:56:08,695
You?

964
00:56:11,095 --> 00:56:14,995
I got married later than Chun Soo, so I'm even more...

965
00:56:15,265 --> 00:56:16,365
of a newlywed.

966
00:56:17,005 --> 00:56:19,975
My goodness. I'm a newlywed too.

967
00:56:20,135 --> 00:56:21,705
Professor Oh, you?

968
00:56:22,005 --> 00:56:24,705
I'm sorry, sir. I share a room with Ha Ni.

969
00:56:25,005 --> 00:56:26,515
I should go to bed.

970
00:56:27,375 --> 00:56:28,415
Good night.

971
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:30,415
I should get going as well.

972
00:56:30,415 --> 00:56:31,685
Sleep well.

973
00:56:31,685 --> 00:56:32,885
Bye.

974
00:56:33,385 --> 00:56:34,615
Have a good night.

975
00:56:36,155 --> 00:56:39,195
Am I to sleep on my own, then?

976
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:42,465
You can sleep with me.

977
00:56:53,005 --> 00:56:54,035
What is it?

978
00:56:55,175 --> 00:56:56,205
You can't sleep?

979
00:56:58,005 --> 00:57:01,375
I guess it's because I'm in different surroundings.

980
00:57:02,515 --> 00:57:04,785
Then go back to Kwang Sook.

981
00:57:05,885 --> 00:57:08,215
Forget it. A man has his pride.

982
00:57:08,255 --> 00:57:10,425
I told her I'd stay out.

983
00:57:10,425 --> 00:57:12,095
I can't go crawling back now.

984
00:57:13,255 --> 00:57:15,565
I bet Kwang Sook will be up waiting for you.

985
00:57:18,225 --> 00:57:20,035
Go home while she still cares...

986
00:57:20,365 --> 00:57:21,965
or you'll get told off later on.

987
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:27,405
Goodness...

988
00:57:47,655 --> 00:57:48,655
What the...

989
00:57:50,295 --> 00:57:51,465
I thought you'd be in bed.

990
00:57:51,595 --> 00:57:54,495
How am I supposed to sleep when my husband basically declared war...

991
00:57:54,495 --> 00:57:55,705
and said he was sleeping somewhere else?

992
00:57:56,405 --> 00:57:58,665
I wouldn't call it declaring war.

993
00:57:59,075 --> 00:58:02,475
I was upset, so I had drinks with my brothers...

994
00:58:02,475 --> 00:58:04,675
- and lost track of time... - Whatever.

995
00:58:05,245 --> 00:58:07,715
I'm tired and going to bed. You do the same.

996
00:58:38,845 --> 00:58:40,675
(Wish Fulfillment Agreement)

997
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:44,115
A wish fulfillment agreement?

998
00:58:44,115 --> 00:58:46,515
We agreed that the loser would grant the winner's wish.

999
00:58:48,885 --> 00:58:52,355
Wish Fulfillment...

1000
00:58:52,895 --> 00:58:54,595
Agreement.

1001
00:58:54,795 --> 00:58:56,425
Ma Kwang Sook.

1002
00:58:56,425 --> 00:58:57,695
Happy now?

1003
00:59:16,585 --> 00:59:18,045
Ta-da.

1004
00:59:20,955 --> 00:59:22,155
What's that?

1005
00:59:23,355 --> 00:59:24,585
Don't you remember this?

1006
00:59:25,225 --> 00:59:27,855
It's the wish fulfillment agreement you signed...

1007
00:59:27,855 --> 00:59:29,595
at the hospital.

1008
00:59:35,395 --> 00:59:36,405
And?

1009
00:59:37,235 --> 00:59:38,405
I'm cashing it in.

1010
00:59:38,935 --> 00:59:39,935
Hubby!

1011
00:59:40,705 --> 00:59:44,275
I want a kid just like you, Kwang Sook.

1012
00:59:45,005 --> 00:59:46,775
One with a lovely smile...

1013
00:59:47,315 --> 00:59:50,585
and the warmth to embrace those around them.

1014
00:59:51,615 --> 00:59:54,085
That's my biggest wish right now.

1015
00:59:54,555 --> 00:59:55,555
So,

1016
00:59:57,355 --> 00:59:58,385
fulfill my wish.

(Chamsarang Women's Clinic)

1018
01:00:39,035 --> 01:00:40,665
Don't you think...

1019
01:00:41,495 --> 01:00:44,305
we're the oldest couple here?

1020
01:00:45,635 --> 01:00:48,775
Physical age doesn't matter.

1021
01:00:54,945 --> 01:00:56,015
Actually,

1022
01:00:57,615 --> 01:00:59,755
what I fear more than a geriatric pregnancy...

1023
01:01:00,085 --> 01:01:03,355
is the disappointment you'll experience...

1024
01:01:04,625 --> 01:01:06,025
if you get your hopes up.

1025
01:01:06,825 --> 01:01:08,425
I won't be disappointed,

1026
01:01:08,995 --> 01:01:11,595
so don't worry ahead of time.

1027
01:01:14,365 --> 01:01:16,235
Ma Kwang Sook and Han Dong Seok.

1028
01:01:16,405 --> 01:01:17,405
Here.

1029
01:01:17,635 --> 01:01:18,635
Let's go.

1030
01:01:23,445 --> 01:01:25,245
You had tests today...

1031
01:01:25,245 --> 01:01:27,715
to check your chances of pregnancy and infertility.

1032
01:01:29,045 --> 01:01:30,115
That's right.

1033
01:01:30,585 --> 01:01:33,785
We're on the older side, you see.

1034
01:01:35,485 --> 01:01:38,455
Ms. Ma, we conducted blood tests and a uterine sonogram for you.

1035
01:01:38,455 --> 01:01:41,055
Your husband was also tested.

1036
01:01:41,795 --> 01:01:44,365
Yes, we completed them without any issues.

1037
01:01:47,535 --> 01:01:49,205
I hate to break this to you.

1038
01:01:50,605 --> 01:01:53,005
Why? Is something wrong?

1039
01:01:54,505 --> 01:01:56,505
You jumped through hoops for no reason.

1040
01:01:59,115 --> 01:02:00,215
Ms. Ma,

1041
01:02:01,715 --> 01:02:04,045
you're already four weeks along.

1042
01:02:06,185 --> 01:02:07,185
- What? - What?

1043
01:02:42,955 --> 01:02:45,585
(For Eagle Brothers)

1044
01:02:45,585 --> 01:02:48,895
Kwang Sook accomplished something amazing.

1045
01:02:49,225 --> 01:02:51,725
It hasn't fully hit me yet,

1046
01:02:51,725 --> 01:02:53,395
and I'm still in shock.

1047
01:02:53,635 --> 01:02:56,205
For enduring every hardship gracefully,

1048
01:02:56,205 --> 01:02:59,475
you were given a reward from above. Don't you agree?

1049
01:02:59,475 --> 01:03:01,635
Kang Soo, what do you say to a blind date?

1050
01:03:01,735 --> 01:03:04,575
She's pretty and has a great personality.

1051
01:03:05,175 --> 01:03:07,075
What do you think? Isn't she great?

1052
01:03:07,275 --> 01:03:10,745
We must stay healthy and live a long life.

1053
01:03:10,985 --> 01:03:12,385
Are you not feeling well, sir?

1054
01:03:12,855 --> 01:03:14,385
What I'm about to say...

1055
01:03:14,385 --> 01:03:16,655
will stay between us, Mr. Park.

1056
01:03:16,755 --> 01:03:18,925
Can you book the appointment for the earliest possible day?

1057
01:03:19,355 --> 01:03:21,325
I believe I'm running short on time.
