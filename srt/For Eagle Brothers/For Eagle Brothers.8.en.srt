1
00:00:02,953 --> 00:00:04,783
(Episode 8)

2
00:00:07,388 --> 00:00:08,388
Hold on.

3
00:00:09,289 --> 00:00:10,328
Is that mister...

4
00:00:11,398 --> 00:00:12,859
really the chairman of this hotel?

5
00:00:14,159 --> 00:00:15,229
Wrap things up well.

6
00:00:15,229 --> 00:00:16,968
If you need anything, you should talk to Mr. Park.

7
00:00:17,128 --> 00:00:18,569
- Of course. - I'll get going then.

8
00:00:18,668 --> 00:00:19,668
Yes, sir.

9
00:00:24,008 --> 00:00:25,109
No way.

10
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:32,448
(LX chairman)

11
00:00:32,448 --> 00:00:33,819
(Han Dong Seok)

12
00:00:33,819 --> 00:00:35,618
(Han Dong Seok, Chairman of LX Group)

13
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:40,819
It's true.

14
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:43,158
(LX chairman)

15
00:00:50,629 --> 00:00:53,539
But I definitely saw him working...

16
00:00:53,968 --> 00:00:56,838
as a doorman in uniform.

17
00:00:57,609 --> 00:00:58,739
(Chairman Han Dong Seok, "Will Create a Novel Space")

18
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:00,808
(Head of Tourist Committee, Chairman Han of LX Hotel)

19
00:01:00,808 --> 00:01:02,409
Is this for real?

20
00:01:04,008 --> 00:01:05,148
Could he be twins?

21
00:01:13,689 --> 00:01:16,258
I'm Ma Kwang Sook, the CEO of Eagle Brewery.

22
00:01:19,998 --> 00:01:21,599
Eagle Brewery...

23
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:23,728
was founded by my grandfather-in-law,

24
00:01:23,728 --> 00:01:25,569
and our family has been upholding...

25
00:01:25,569 --> 00:01:27,769
its tradition for 90 years over 3 generations.

26
00:01:27,769 --> 00:01:29,769
I was wondering why it had such a rich taste.

27
00:01:29,769 --> 00:01:30,939
Now I know...

28
00:01:30,939 --> 00:01:32,808
it's because it comes from an established brewery.

29
00:01:32,808 --> 00:01:34,778
I appreciate the acknowledgment.

30
00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:38,748
Shall we begin, then?

31
00:01:39,278 --> 00:01:40,278
Yes.

32
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:44,588
(Jang-Kwang Makgeolli)

33
00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:54,099
(Jang-Kwang Makgeolli Tasting Evaluation Sheet)

34
00:01:54,099 --> 00:01:56,599
If I were to define this liquor from a sommelier's perspective,

35
00:01:57,429 --> 00:01:59,698
I'd call it the K-champagne.

36
00:02:00,099 --> 00:02:03,008
It has a unique taste with bubbles and acidity...

37
00:02:03,238 --> 00:02:04,439
that can be found in champagne.

38
00:02:05,279 --> 00:02:09,279
This tteok galbi is quite spicy as it has Cheongyang peppers in it.

39
00:02:09,809 --> 00:02:12,779
The sweet taste of the makgeolli softens the spiciness.

40
00:02:13,978 --> 00:02:16,619
Chairman Han recommended Jang-Kwang Makgeolli.

41
00:02:16,619 --> 00:02:19,619
Actually, he is a fastidious eater.

42
00:02:19,888 --> 00:02:22,828
Did Chairman Han recommend our makgeolli?

43
00:02:23,529 --> 00:02:24,529
Yes.

44
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:29,828
I was wondering about the makgeolli you gave me.

45
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:32,599
Can I get a few more bottles of it?

46
00:02:32,798 --> 00:02:35,008
I enjoyed what you gave me.

47
00:02:36,409 --> 00:02:40,608
I never thought makgeolli would have those bubbles and acidity.

48
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:41,948
It was unexpected.

49
00:02:44,249 --> 00:02:47,649
I gave him a few bottles when we got the samples ready.

50
00:02:48,018 --> 00:02:51,249
He did say good things about it after tasting it.

51
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:55,789
I'm thankful that he recommended it to his employees.

52
00:02:55,888 --> 00:02:57,089
How nice.

53
00:02:57,559 --> 00:03:00,198
Have you met Chairman Han before?

54
00:03:00,529 --> 00:03:02,129
Yes. A few times.

55
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,698
We ate together and had coffee.

56
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:09,008
He's known for avoiding private meetings.

57
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,069
That's really impressive.

58
00:03:12,809 --> 00:03:17,048
It's just that we met by chance a few times.

59
00:03:17,048 --> 00:03:19,018
You have connections with Chairman Han.

60
00:03:19,448 --> 00:03:21,178
I'm sorry we didn't realize that.

61
00:03:21,948 --> 00:03:24,719
No, it's nothing like connections.

62
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:26,089
Anyway,

63
00:03:26,589 --> 00:03:28,089
your makgeolli is impressive.

64
00:03:28,589 --> 00:03:30,858
Please wait for good results.

65
00:03:32,798 --> 00:03:35,328
Thank you. I look forward to hearing from you.

66
00:03:45,638 --> 00:03:47,539
- Hey. - I brought chamomile tea.

67
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,548
It's caffeine-free, so enjoy it when it's warm.

68
00:03:51,448 --> 00:03:52,448
Thank you.

69
00:03:54,379 --> 00:03:57,388
I heard you met Professor Kim at the exhibition.

70
00:03:57,849 --> 00:04:01,928
As you asked, I said hello and had a talk with her.

71
00:04:02,629 --> 00:04:03,858
That's great.

72
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:06,099
By the way,

73
00:04:07,099 --> 00:04:10,029
after you refused to have tea with her,

74
00:04:10,668 --> 00:04:14,368
you apparently had tea with a woman at the coffee shop.

75
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:16,808
What?

76
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:18,839
Oh, right.

77
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,978
Who is the woman?

78
00:04:23,478 --> 00:04:25,918
I just happened to find her phone,

79
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:27,779
so I met her and returned it.

80
00:04:28,618 --> 00:04:30,089
You returned it yourself?

81
00:04:30,349 --> 00:04:33,089
I was going to ask Mr. Kim, but I had some time to spare,

82
00:04:33,089 --> 00:04:34,688
so I met her myself.

83
00:04:35,589 --> 00:04:36,659
Why?

84
00:04:37,228 --> 00:04:39,029
I see. It's nothing.

85
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:41,228
I'll leave you alone then.

86
00:04:48,068 --> 00:04:50,509
Have you been working at the hotel for a long time?

87
00:04:50,509 --> 00:04:51,779
Your salary must be quite high too.

88
00:04:51,779 --> 00:04:53,709
You still have a few years left before retirement, don't you?

89
00:04:53,709 --> 00:04:56,108
Don't spend too much and save up.

90
00:04:56,108 --> 00:04:58,219
Nothing beats cash for the elderly.

91
00:04:58,219 --> 00:04:59,779
There are many savings accounts that offer good interest rates.

92
00:04:59,779 --> 00:05:01,019
Would you like a consultation?

93
00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:12,199
Why did you even worry about the retirement...

94
00:05:12,829 --> 00:05:15,498
of the chairman of LX Hotel, Ma Kwang Sook?

95
00:05:19,339 --> 00:05:21,238
I did think he had a fine complexion,

96
00:05:21,568 --> 00:05:24,769
but I had no idea he was the chairman.

97
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:31,248
But considering how he recommended Jang-Kwang Makgeolli,

98
00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:34,149
I don't think he hates me.

99
00:05:37,349 --> 00:05:38,358
It's all right.

100
00:05:41,628 --> 00:05:44,329
- I'm back. - Hey.

101
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,599
How did it go?

102
00:05:46,998 --> 00:05:50,269
They did a tasting, and it got favorable responses.

103
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:52,798
I have a good feeling.

104
00:05:53,539 --> 00:05:56,438
Then will we be able to drink our makgeolli at LX Hotel?

105
00:05:56,438 --> 00:05:57,568
Of course.

106
00:05:57,668 --> 00:06:00,409
If we get to supply our makgeolli, we'll have dinner at LX Hotel.

107
00:06:00,608 --> 00:06:02,548
It's on me.

108
00:06:02,748 --> 00:06:05,378
Are you serious? You have to keep your promise.

109
00:06:05,579 --> 00:06:08,449
A real woman doesn't go back on her word.

110
00:06:08,688 --> 00:06:11,318
Come on. Don't count your chickens before they're hatched.

111
00:06:11,318 --> 00:06:13,818
Counting doesn't cost money. What's the harm in that?

112
00:06:15,228 --> 00:06:17,889
We just got a call from the bank.

113
00:06:18,728 --> 00:06:21,099
Do you think you can take care of it?

114
00:06:23,269 --> 00:06:24,498
I'll have to deal with it somehow.

115
00:06:24,798 --> 00:06:27,969
- One, two. One, two, three, four. - One, two. One, two, three, four.

116
00:06:27,969 --> 00:06:31,238
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

117
00:06:31,238 --> 00:06:34,409
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

118
00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:37,949
- Happy birthday, dear Ms. Kim - Happy birthday, dear Ms. Kim

119
00:06:38,149 --> 00:06:41,949
- Happy birthday to you - Happy birthday to you

120
00:06:49,688 --> 00:06:51,699
- Did you make a wish? - Yes.

121
00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:53,798
What was the wish?

122
00:06:53,798 --> 00:06:55,469
Why do you ask?

123
00:06:55,469 --> 00:06:57,628
It must be finding a good man and getting married soon.

124
00:06:58,798 --> 00:07:01,368
- Am I right? - Yes, you are.

125
00:07:02,938 --> 00:07:04,839
Ms. Kim, what's your ideal type?

126
00:07:05,608 --> 00:07:07,409
Well... I don't know.

127
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:10,048
Maybe it's because I majored in music,

128
00:07:10,248 --> 00:07:13,349
so I think it would be nice if my husband was also in the arts.

129
00:07:13,579 --> 00:07:15,849
I think we'd have a lot in common.

130
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:22,159
That brat is clearly hitting on him.

131
00:07:22,159 --> 00:07:24,459
She doesn't need to go very far to find a man like that.

132
00:07:24,459 --> 00:07:26,029
A man engaged in art?

133
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:28,529
He's sitting right in front of her.

134
00:07:29,269 --> 00:07:31,938
- Come on. Stop it. - Gosh, seriously...

135
00:07:33,368 --> 00:07:35,709
This is ridiculous.

136
00:07:36,938 --> 00:07:39,209
This is really nice. Why don't we go to karaoke?

137
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:40,279
- That's great. - Karaoke?

138
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:43,108
- Let's go to karaoke! - Let's go to karaoke!

139
00:07:43,108 --> 00:07:44,279
- Let's go to karaoke! - Do you have time?

140
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:46,519
Yes.

141
00:07:48,389 --> 00:07:50,019
Let's go to karaoke!

142
00:07:50,349 --> 00:07:51,858
You're coming, right?

143
00:07:55,789 --> 00:07:56,988
Let's go!

144
00:08:00,029 --> 00:08:02,829
Why would he want to go to karaoke and sing?

145
00:08:03,529 --> 00:08:07,039
My love who has come to visit me

146
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,438
Welcome

147
00:08:08,438 --> 00:08:13,209
I've been waiting for you

148
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:17,409
Please hurry and come to me

149
00:08:17,409 --> 00:08:22,089
I'll be a flower for you

150
00:08:22,248 --> 00:08:27,318
What have you been doing? What took you so long?

151
00:08:27,318 --> 00:08:32,129
I've been waiting for you

152
00:08:32,129 --> 00:08:36,399
Please hurry and come to me

153
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,629
I'll be...

154
00:08:43,168 --> 00:08:44,168
What was that?

155
00:08:44,869 --> 00:08:47,078
I'm not even half done yet.

156
00:08:47,609 --> 00:08:49,879
My goodness. I'm so sorry.

157
00:08:50,149 --> 00:08:52,848
I pressed the wrong button while reserving the next song.

158
00:08:56,318 --> 00:08:58,088
How rude you are.

159
00:08:58,088 --> 00:09:00,359
I'll enter the number again. You can sing it again from the top.

160
00:09:00,918 --> 00:09:02,928
I'm really sorry.

161
00:09:03,188 --> 00:09:05,298
The next song is for you, Ms. Kim.

162
00:09:05,298 --> 00:09:07,198
You should sing first. You're the birthday girl.

163
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:09,229
You don't mind, do you?

164
00:09:09,598 --> 00:09:10,968
Go ahead, Ms. Kim.

165
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:12,568
It's your birthday. Sing for us.

166
00:09:12,869 --> 00:09:15,838
Oh, right. Actually, it's not that...

167
00:09:15,838 --> 00:09:19,708
she just plays the piano well. Her singing is great too.

168
00:09:25,678 --> 00:09:26,749
I'm sorry.

169
00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:37,058
It's just my birthday,

170
00:09:37,729 --> 00:09:40,499
but you all came here and celebrated it all together.

171
00:09:40,499 --> 00:09:42,328
Thank you so much.

172
00:09:46,739 --> 00:09:48,369
She's so pretty.

173
00:09:50,369 --> 00:09:53,308
Born in March

174
00:09:54,979 --> 00:09:57,779
You are so beautiful

175
00:09:59,718 --> 00:10:03,149
You are clean like snow

176
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:07,289
My only you

177
00:10:09,289 --> 00:10:11,058
Born in March

178
00:10:11,058 --> 00:10:13,328
Have some water and take a breather.

179
00:10:14,428 --> 00:10:16,198
Why did you call me out when you'd be like this?

180
00:10:16,769 --> 00:10:17,769
What?

181
00:10:19,298 --> 00:10:20,899
I never wanted...

182
00:10:21,938 --> 00:10:24,039
to come to Ms. Kim's birthday party.

183
00:10:25,338 --> 00:10:26,708
But you told me to come.

184
00:10:27,239 --> 00:10:28,749
So I forced myself to come.

185
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:30,548
You seem quite drunk.

186
00:10:31,348 --> 00:10:33,749
- Why don't you get some sleep? - But spring

187
00:10:34,348 --> 00:10:39,889
Summer, fall, and winter.

188
00:10:41,318 --> 00:10:43,729
Happy birthday to you

189
00:10:43,729 --> 00:10:46,098
- Happy birthday to you - They look great together.

190
00:10:46,098 --> 00:10:48,869
Happy birthday to you

191
00:10:48,869 --> 00:10:50,798
Happy birthday to you

192
00:10:50,798 --> 00:10:53,139
Happy birthday to you

193
00:10:53,139 --> 00:10:55,668
Ms. Kim who was born in March

194
00:10:55,668 --> 00:10:58,208
Your birthday

195
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:00,039
Happy birthday, Ms. Kim

196
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:02,208
Happy birthday to you

197
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:05,979
- Happy birthday to you - What a sight.

198
00:11:05,979 --> 00:11:07,948
Happy birthday to you

199
00:11:07,948 --> 00:11:11,389
Happy birthday to you

200
00:11:11,389 --> 00:11:12,958
Happy birthday to you

201
00:11:13,619 --> 00:11:15,259
Wait. Where are you going?

202
00:11:15,729 --> 00:11:16,729
I'm going home.

203
00:11:16,729 --> 00:11:19,328
This is just the beginning. Why are you leaving already?

204
00:11:19,328 --> 00:11:21,198
- Stay here and have fun. - Forget it.

205
00:11:21,198 --> 00:11:23,029
Come on. We came to karaoke after such a long while.

206
00:11:23,029 --> 00:11:24,928
Let yourself go and have fun.

207
00:11:24,928 --> 00:11:26,098
I said no!

208
00:11:35,578 --> 00:11:36,649
What was that?

209
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:41,279
Why...

210
00:11:41,948 --> 00:11:44,749
did that fly in your direction?

211
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:48,119
You're bleeding!

212
00:11:48,218 --> 00:11:50,029
There's blood? Where?

213
00:11:50,428 --> 00:11:51,428
Oh, no.

214
00:11:51,428 --> 00:11:53,399
I can't have a scar on my face.

215
00:11:54,729 --> 00:11:56,598
Why are you doing this to me?

216
00:11:57,269 --> 00:11:58,668
Why on earth?

217
00:12:13,448 --> 00:12:14,519
Hi, Chun Soo.

218
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:16,318
Are you putting Ha Ni to bed?

219
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:17,619
Shall I call again later?

220
00:12:17,948 --> 00:12:19,489
No. She's asleep.

221
00:12:25,359 --> 00:12:26,529
Is something wrong?

222
00:12:27,698 --> 00:12:28,869
Nothing's wrong.

223
00:12:30,229 --> 00:12:32,798
I was drinking on my own and thought of you.

224
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:35,509
Why are you drinking alone this late?

225
00:12:38,139 --> 00:12:40,479
Who could I drink with?

226
00:12:40,909 --> 00:12:43,649
My wife and daughter live half around the world.

227
00:12:43,948 --> 00:12:45,519
Tell your wife to come home.

228
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:48,418
Even a married couple that's apart for too long...

229
00:12:48,418 --> 00:12:49,749
could drift apart.

230
00:12:51,048 --> 00:12:53,918
I know. I plan to fly over there at the end of the month.

231
00:12:54,918 --> 00:12:57,359
I haven't visited since COVID broke out.

232
00:13:01,999 --> 00:13:02,999
Beom Soo.

233
00:13:03,769 --> 00:13:04,828
Did you...

234
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:08,198
see my wife before you flew back?

235
00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:10,468
Was it last year?

236
00:13:10,468 --> 00:13:12,239
I had half a day to kill after a seminar,

237
00:13:12,239 --> 00:13:14,009
so we met up for tea.

238
00:13:14,009 --> 00:13:15,009
Why?

239
00:13:15,009 --> 00:13:16,479
Did she say anything?

240
00:13:16,909 --> 00:13:19,678
We asked after each other but didn't say much else.

241
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:22,389
She's not the affectionate type.

242
00:13:23,389 --> 00:13:26,218
Why? Are you having trouble with her?

243
00:13:27,289 --> 00:13:29,759
There's no trouble. It's just...

244
00:13:30,489 --> 00:13:33,428
I know. If you're apart for too long,

245
00:13:33,428 --> 00:13:34,958
you don't know how the other person is doing,

246
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:37,029
so misunderstandings arise and arguments happen.

247
00:13:37,828 --> 00:13:40,499
Chun Soo. When you're over there,

248
00:13:40,499 --> 00:13:42,808
talk your wife into coming back with you, okay?

249
00:13:42,808 --> 00:13:43,909
I'll do that.

250
00:13:44,668 --> 00:13:46,609
I talked too much when you must be tired.

251
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:48,639
If Ha Ni's asleep, you can rest too.

252
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,048
You must be exhausted.

253
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:52,119
Take care.

254
00:13:52,119 --> 00:13:54,078
Don't drink too much and go to sleep soon.

255
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:55,149
Let's talk again.

256
00:13:56,048 --> 00:13:57,048
Bye.

257
00:14:03,859 --> 00:14:05,828
I was at a hotel to meet a buyer for dinner...

258
00:14:05,828 --> 00:14:07,029
and saw this.

259
00:14:07,259 --> 00:14:08,458
It's Young Eun, right?

260
00:14:22,509 --> 00:14:24,109
Were you at work all this while?

261
00:14:24,109 --> 00:14:25,109
What about dinner?

262
00:14:25,109 --> 00:14:26,318
Who cares about dinner?

263
00:14:27,078 --> 00:14:28,119
Where's Se Ri?

264
00:14:29,588 --> 00:14:30,889
She's in her room.

265
00:14:30,889 --> 00:14:32,458
Why? Shall I call her?

266
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:34,759
She's not the problem. You are.

267
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:39,058
Why are you venting at me again?

268
00:14:39,798 --> 00:14:41,428
What did I do?

269
00:14:41,428 --> 00:14:44,729
LX Hotel might get Eagle Brewery to supply them.

270
00:14:44,769 --> 00:14:46,399
They called to arrange a tasting.

271
00:14:46,838 --> 00:14:48,269
LX Hotel?

272
00:14:48,269 --> 00:14:49,769
Yes, LX Hotel!

273
00:14:51,068 --> 00:14:52,808
Do hotels sell makgeolli too?

274
00:14:53,678 --> 00:14:55,379
Did they call you?

275
00:14:55,379 --> 00:14:56,779
No. Not at all.

276
00:14:57,379 --> 00:15:00,218
Chairman Han knows us, and our kids know each other.

277
00:15:00,218 --> 00:15:02,019
How could he do this?

278
00:15:02,019 --> 00:15:04,188
How little must he think of us...

279
00:15:04,188 --> 00:15:06,818
if he treated us like this?

280
00:15:06,818 --> 00:15:08,958
I'll meet with Chairman Han.

281
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:10,588
Don't be so angry.

282
00:15:10,588 --> 00:15:12,859
On every holiday and his wife's death anniversary,

283
00:15:12,859 --> 00:15:15,058
we gave him alcohol worth so much money.

284
00:15:15,359 --> 00:15:17,068
How can he do this...

285
00:15:17,068 --> 00:15:18,629
after accepting our gifts?

286
00:15:18,629 --> 00:15:20,769
There must be a reason.

287
00:15:20,769 --> 00:15:22,338
Calm down.

288
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:25,039
Will you do a better job?

289
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:26,078
Darn it.

290
00:15:28,109 --> 00:15:29,149
Oh, gosh.

291
00:15:31,249 --> 00:15:34,749
You yell at me whenever something goes wrong!

292
00:15:37,989 --> 00:15:39,318
Goodness.

293
00:15:39,418 --> 00:15:40,519
Hang on.

294
00:15:41,058 --> 00:15:43,588
A high-class place like LX Hotel wants to sell...

295
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:45,958
Eagle Brewery's product?

296
00:15:49,769 --> 00:15:51,729
(Application for Discharge)

297
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:56,409
- Victory. - Victory.

298
00:15:59,409 --> 00:16:00,409
Victory.

299
00:16:00,479 --> 00:16:01,739
Shouldn't you go home?

300
00:16:02,578 --> 00:16:04,078
I will soon.

301
00:16:04,848 --> 00:16:05,848
Are you going somewhere?

302
00:16:06,918 --> 00:16:08,678
Today's training was extra hard.

303
00:16:08,678 --> 00:16:10,188
We're off to get some snacks.

304
00:16:18,058 --> 00:16:20,259
Eat something that's good for you and not a snack.

305
00:16:20,259 --> 00:16:22,058
- Thank you. Victory. - Thank you. Victory.

306
00:16:22,058 --> 00:16:23,168
Victory. Go ahead.

307
00:16:23,629 --> 00:16:24,828
Good night.

308
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,678
I'm home.

309
00:16:45,619 --> 00:16:47,519
You did well today, CEO Ma.

310
00:16:47,918 --> 00:16:49,029
"CEO Ma?"

311
00:16:49,629 --> 00:16:52,029
My title got a huge upgrade.

312
00:16:52,029 --> 00:16:55,499
Knowing that your makgeolli might be available at LX Hotel...

313
00:16:55,869 --> 00:16:58,029
made me respect you even though you're my daughter.

314
00:16:59,568 --> 00:17:00,568
Come on.

315
00:17:01,169 --> 00:17:02,939
We don't know yet.

316
00:17:04,108 --> 00:17:05,679
You said you had a good feeling.

317
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:08,209
If our CEO Ma has a good feeling,

318
00:17:08,209 --> 00:17:10,108
then you will get the deal.

319
00:17:12,348 --> 00:17:15,019
I thought I'd lost my retirement fund.

320
00:17:15,949 --> 00:17:17,219
The idea that...

321
00:17:17,219 --> 00:17:19,818
I might recover my investment and return to Golden Castle...

322
00:17:19,818 --> 00:17:20,959
makes me feel like...

323
00:17:22,019 --> 00:17:23,328
I'm in a dream.

324
00:17:24,289 --> 00:17:26,658
Do you dislike living with me that much?

325
00:17:28,828 --> 00:17:30,529
There's no joy in my life.

326
00:17:31,128 --> 00:17:32,939
Here, jars of alcohol.

327
00:17:32,939 --> 00:17:34,739
There, more jars of alcohol.

328
00:17:34,739 --> 00:17:37,269
There is nothing but jars of alcohol.

329
00:17:37,908 --> 00:17:39,808
And there are no men.

330
00:17:40,179 --> 00:17:41,509
There's nothing to look at.

331
00:17:42,108 --> 00:17:44,378
You're too old for that, Mom.

332
00:17:44,808 --> 00:17:46,048
Isn't that a disgrace?

333
00:17:46,779 --> 00:17:48,318
Why is that a disgrace?

334
00:17:48,878 --> 00:17:50,618
My love cells still function,

335
00:17:50,618 --> 00:17:52,419
and that means I'm still in season.

336
00:17:52,419 --> 00:17:53,959
It's something to be proud of.

337
00:17:56,029 --> 00:17:57,759
You should meet someone nice...

338
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,759
Enough!

339
00:17:59,358 --> 00:18:00,499
That's enough.

340
00:18:03,269 --> 00:18:07,169
Are you going to mourn Jang Soo and stay single forever or what?

341
00:18:10,209 --> 00:18:11,808
I won't allow that.

342
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:20,118
How did I birth a fool like her?

343
00:18:25,989 --> 00:18:28,088
What a day it was.

344
00:18:31,358 --> 00:18:33,529
What did I get on the jacket?

345
00:18:35,558 --> 00:18:37,128
I should wash it.

346
00:18:43,568 --> 00:18:45,908
(Chairman Han Dong Seok)

347
00:18:45,908 --> 00:18:48,838
So have a cup of coffee on me by flashing this card.

348
00:18:48,838 --> 00:18:50,308
I'll come to see you once I'm done. Take it.

349
00:18:50,308 --> 00:18:52,749
Are you making a move on me?

350
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:55,249
If you feign ignorance again,

351
00:18:55,249 --> 00:18:58,348
I'll report everything to the owner of this hotel.

352
00:19:01,088 --> 00:19:03,558
Mr. Han Dong Seok.

353
00:19:07,499 --> 00:19:10,628
I should've checked the business card then and there.

354
00:19:12,638 --> 00:19:14,838
I humiliated myself because I didn't know better.

355
00:19:15,669 --> 00:19:17,568
How am I to face him now?

356
00:19:24,509 --> 00:19:27,578
I did some thinking all night long.

357
00:19:28,378 --> 00:19:31,388
I think his subordinates are fooling around.

358
00:19:31,949 --> 00:19:35,489
I'll meet with Chairman Han and deal with him directly.

359
00:19:36,828 --> 00:19:37,929
Yes, do that.

360
00:19:39,858 --> 00:19:41,898
I'll go to Jinhae.

361
00:19:42,328 --> 00:19:43,499
To see Gyeol?

362
00:19:43,568 --> 00:19:44,628
Yes.

363
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:49,108
I should be the adult and sort things out.

364
00:19:49,608 --> 00:19:52,138
We'll get nowhere...

365
00:19:52,138 --> 00:19:53,838
if we leave it to the kids.

366
00:19:54,908 --> 00:19:58,848
Are you sure that Gyeol likes Se Ri?

367
00:19:58,979 --> 00:20:00,219
Don't even ask.

368
00:20:00,219 --> 00:20:01,979
It's a fact.

369
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:05,348
LX Hotel must be losing their touch.

370
00:20:05,818 --> 00:20:08,858
How could they think of selling Eagle Brewery's stuff?

371
00:20:08,858 --> 00:20:10,029
That's so low-class.

372
00:20:12,388 --> 00:20:15,699
Jang Soo was exactly like his dad, the owner before him.

373
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:18,798
They made the best liquor they could and didn't mess with ingredients.

374
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:20,769
That's why their stuff tasted good.

375
00:20:21,199 --> 00:20:22,709
Who do you work for?

376
00:20:22,709 --> 00:20:24,009
Eagle or Silla?

377
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:26,608
You can't compare.

378
00:20:26,608 --> 00:20:29,279
Eagle's a corner store, and Silla's a huge company.

379
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:31,509
Why do you even care about them?

380
00:20:31,509 --> 00:20:34,019
They keep getting on my nerves.

381
00:20:34,019 --> 00:20:36,219
Don't mind them at all.

382
00:20:36,219 --> 00:20:39,259
They have nothing to do with us now.

383
00:20:39,259 --> 00:20:41,289
Get to work or you'll be late.

384
00:20:41,289 --> 00:20:43,029
- Darn it! - Hurry.

385
00:20:47,098 --> 00:20:49,328
Jang-Kwang Makgeolli's tasting results.

386
00:20:49,828 --> 00:20:50,868
(Chairman Han Dong Seok)

387
00:20:50,868 --> 00:20:52,838
The general consensus is that they were surprised...

388
00:20:52,838 --> 00:20:55,169
by the quality and didn't expect it at all.

389
00:20:56,908 --> 00:20:58,269
I was surprised...

390
00:20:58,269 --> 00:21:00,638
by the clean, refreshing taste when I tried it.

391
00:21:02,108 --> 00:21:03,908
They all felt the same.

392
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:05,449
They'll have to...

393
00:21:06,019 --> 00:21:08,979
work on improving the bottle and label.

394
00:21:08,979 --> 00:21:11,519
It's a small brewery.

395
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:14,388
They might appreciate some help from our Design Team.

396
00:21:14,588 --> 00:21:16,489
Yes, sir. We'll sign a provisional contract...

397
00:21:16,489 --> 00:21:18,289
stating we'll make the final decision...

398
00:21:18,289 --> 00:21:19,628
after the packaging's improved.

399
00:21:19,729 --> 00:21:21,229
Do that.

400
00:21:24,029 --> 00:21:25,029
Sir.

401
00:21:26,568 --> 00:21:27,898
There's talk...

402
00:21:28,969 --> 00:21:30,969
that the brewery's CEO has a personal connection with you.

403
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,279
"A personal connection?"

404
00:21:35,439 --> 00:21:36,449
Yes.

405
00:21:36,449 --> 00:21:40,348
She had meals with you as well as coffee,

406
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:42,848
which is what she told everyone.

407
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:47,759
We only met a few times because our paths...

408
00:21:48,019 --> 00:21:49,489
just happened to cross.

409
00:21:51,088 --> 00:21:53,429
Bring her in sometime and tell her to watch what she says.

410
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:55,298
Yes, sir. I'll take care of it.

411
00:22:02,199 --> 00:22:05,108
I can't believe she'd be this unprofessional.

412
00:22:09,009 --> 00:22:10,249
Darn.

413
00:22:12,564 --> 00:22:14,603
I came by to discuss something with you.

414
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:17,734
Through a friend who runs a convenience store,

415
00:22:18,034 --> 00:22:20,603
I looked into ways to distribute our makgeolli...

416
00:22:20,603 --> 00:22:21,903
to local convenience stores.

417
00:22:23,474 --> 00:22:27,143
If you'll allow it, I'd like to write up the proposal.

418
00:22:29,084 --> 00:22:30,713
That idea never even crossed my mind.

419
00:22:30,713 --> 00:22:32,353
Thank you, Chun Soo.

420
00:22:33,883 --> 00:22:34,984
No need to thank me.

421
00:22:35,623 --> 00:22:36,883
I'm the one who feels guilty...

422
00:22:37,893 --> 00:22:40,294
for not being able to do more since you do all the heavy lifting.

423
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:42,693
Don't say that.

424
00:22:44,893 --> 00:22:45,963
Just a second.

425
00:22:47,463 --> 00:22:49,163
Yes, Mr. Park. Hello.

426
00:22:52,034 --> 00:22:53,203
A provisional contract?

427
00:22:54,804 --> 00:22:57,373
Yes, I'll get things ready and head over.

428
00:23:02,183 --> 00:23:03,584
Why? What is it?

429
00:23:03,643 --> 00:23:06,453
We'll be supplying our makgeolli to LX Hotel!

430
00:23:08,024 --> 00:23:09,153
LX Hotel?

431
00:23:10,324 --> 00:23:12,524
A few days ago, the department heads got together...

432
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:14,294
for a tasting of Jang-Kwang Makgeolli,

433
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,094
and they all loved it.

434
00:23:16,524 --> 00:23:18,594
We're signing a provisional contract before the delivery.

435
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:20,564
Kwang Sook, congratulations.

436
00:23:20,834 --> 00:23:22,133
You're amazing.

437
00:23:22,504 --> 00:23:25,703
I can't take credit for it. It was all Jang Soo.

438
00:23:31,713 --> 00:23:32,744
The seal.

439
00:23:33,074 --> 00:23:34,683
Gosh, where did I put the seal?

440
00:23:34,844 --> 00:23:36,514
- What? - The seal.

441
00:23:36,514 --> 00:23:39,183
- Kwang Sook, wait. - The seal.

442
00:23:39,284 --> 00:23:41,683
Don't rush things and take your time looking for it.

443
00:23:46,123 --> 00:23:47,153
Found it.

444
00:23:47,324 --> 00:23:49,294
(Eagle Brewery)

445
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:50,623
Kwang Sook, wait.

446
00:23:51,294 --> 00:23:53,193
Don't get so excited that you drive recklessly.

447
00:23:53,294 --> 00:23:54,433
Don't you worry.

448
00:23:55,203 --> 00:23:57,863
I need to go over the documents if I'm to write up a proposal.

449
00:23:57,863 --> 00:23:59,173
Can I work in your office?

450
00:23:59,834 --> 00:24:01,304
Stay until I get back.

451
00:24:01,844 --> 00:24:04,044
We should celebrate over drinks.

452
00:24:04,143 --> 00:24:05,244
Got it.

453
00:24:05,943 --> 00:24:07,443
You'd better not betray me.

454
00:24:07,544 --> 00:24:09,814
Don't worry about that and do well signing the contract.

455
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:11,044
- Got it. - Good.

456
00:24:14,084 --> 00:24:15,183
Go, Kwang Sook!

457
00:24:19,953 --> 00:24:22,463
Hey, Dad's getting ready for work.

458
00:24:22,693 --> 00:24:23,863
Just a second.

459
00:24:29,504 --> 00:24:31,933
Goodness. Were you asking for me?

460
00:24:32,903 --> 00:24:36,943
I have to go to work, so have fun at the babysitter's.

461
00:24:38,173 --> 00:24:39,244
Of course.

462
00:24:39,873 --> 00:24:41,484
Let's not keep her waiting.

463
00:24:49,353 --> 00:24:50,623
Yes, it's me.

464
00:24:50,623 --> 00:24:52,393
I was going over a few things for my lecture and am running late.

465
00:24:52,393 --> 00:24:53,423
I'm on my way out.

466
00:24:54,623 --> 00:24:56,994
Gosh, I'm so sorry about this,

467
00:24:57,794 --> 00:24:59,433
but I was struck with a bad cold...

468
00:25:00,933 --> 00:25:02,433
and can't take Ha Ni today.

469
00:25:03,163 --> 00:25:05,304
I hear you. There's nothing we can do about it.

470
00:25:05,903 --> 00:25:08,173
I feel bad since you have lectures today.

471
00:25:09,474 --> 00:25:10,774
I'll reach out to others,

472
00:25:10,774 --> 00:25:13,044
so don't worry about Ha Ni and rest up.

473
00:25:14,044 --> 00:25:15,084
Sure.

474
00:25:16,913 --> 00:25:17,913
Oh, no. This is bad.

475
00:25:20,713 --> 00:25:22,183
(Chun Soo)

476
00:25:22,183 --> 00:25:23,353
Chun Soo, where are you right now?

477
00:25:24,024 --> 00:25:25,094
I'm at the brewery.

478
00:25:25,923 --> 00:25:27,294
Why? Is something up?

479
00:25:27,623 --> 00:25:30,693
Ha Ni's babysitter has a bad cold.

480
00:25:30,963 --> 00:25:32,933
I have lectures to get to but no one can look after Ha Ni.

481
00:25:33,294 --> 00:25:35,064
I'll grab a cab and come right over.

482
00:25:35,163 --> 00:25:37,463
No, don't. You're too far out.

483
00:25:37,504 --> 00:25:38,873
I'll try Heung Soo.

484
00:25:39,433 --> 00:25:40,504
Got it, Chun Soo.

485
00:25:42,044 --> 00:25:43,574
(Heung Soo)

486
00:25:50,044 --> 00:25:51,814
(Beom Soo)

487
00:25:52,213 --> 00:25:53,254
Is he asleep?

488
00:25:55,584 --> 00:25:56,653
I'll be late.

489
00:25:59,554 --> 00:26:02,423
Ha Ni, why don't you come to campus with me today?

490
00:26:03,693 --> 00:26:04,693
Let's go.

491
00:26:04,994 --> 00:26:05,994
All right.

492
00:26:12,734 --> 00:26:13,933
There.

493
00:26:17,173 --> 00:26:18,474
Daddy's right here.

494
00:26:19,713 --> 00:26:21,613
Daddy's back. Just a second.

495
00:26:26,653 --> 00:26:27,653
All right.

496
00:26:51,304 --> 00:26:53,744
(Missed call: Beom Soo)

497
00:26:53,744 --> 00:26:54,814
I wonder why Beom Soo called.

498
00:26:58,613 --> 00:27:02,084
Hey, Heung Soo. I called to ask for a favor,

499
00:27:02,183 --> 00:27:03,254
but I'm good.

500
00:27:04,084 --> 00:27:06,794
I went out to get some ramyeon. Why? Is something up?

501
00:27:06,953 --> 00:27:08,024
It's nothing.

502
00:27:08,724 --> 00:27:10,623
Why are you having ramyeon for breakfast though?

503
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:13,534
Well, I went out for drinks last night.

504
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:15,933
Nothing cures a hangover quite like ramyeon does.

505
00:27:17,064 --> 00:27:20,004
Beom Soo, would you like some incredible kimchi?

506
00:27:20,004 --> 00:27:21,074
I could drop some off later.

507
00:27:21,074 --> 00:27:23,943
I'm good, so make sure you eat well yourself.

508
00:27:24,044 --> 00:27:25,143
Got it.

509
00:27:26,014 --> 00:27:27,113
Professor Oh,

510
00:27:27,373 --> 00:27:30,484
just call me anytime if you need a favor. Got it?

511
00:27:30,943 --> 00:27:31,953
Sure.

512
00:27:32,514 --> 00:27:34,084
All right. We'll talk again soon.

513
00:27:34,683 --> 00:27:35,683
Got it.

514
00:27:44,224 --> 00:27:45,594
I don't care how drunk she was.

515
00:27:46,494 --> 00:27:48,834
She can't throw a tambourine at someone for no reason.

516
00:27:49,504 --> 00:27:50,903
If this leaves a scar,

517
00:27:51,433 --> 00:27:53,274
I'll sue her.

518
00:28:01,274 --> 00:28:02,413
Gosh, that's good.

519
00:28:03,943 --> 00:28:05,653
You need to be careful about acting out while drunk.

520
00:28:05,653 --> 00:28:06,653
Don't make it a habit.

521
00:28:07,484 --> 00:28:09,353
No one was acting out.

522
00:28:09,953 --> 00:28:12,024
You kept stopping me from going home,

523
00:28:12,453 --> 00:28:14,393
and it flew out of my hand.

524
00:28:14,393 --> 00:28:16,824
You should be grateful it only grazed him.

525
00:28:16,824 --> 00:28:19,834
It would've been a disaster had it hit him straight on.

526
00:28:20,564 --> 00:28:23,534
If only the tambourine had flown in that vixen's direction.

527
00:28:23,903 --> 00:28:25,173
What are you talking about?

528
00:28:26,804 --> 00:28:27,903
It's nothing.

529
00:28:31,173 --> 00:28:34,113
Ms. Kim didn't know what to do and felt bad for Mr. Oh...

530
00:28:34,113 --> 00:28:36,643
since it happened on her birthday.

531
00:28:38,353 --> 00:28:40,484
If things go right, we might hear bells this year.

532
00:28:40,853 --> 00:28:41,923
What bells?

533
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,123
I observed them last night,

534
00:28:44,423 --> 00:28:45,754
and Mr. Oh and Ms. Kim...

535
00:28:45,754 --> 00:28:47,653
seem to finally be flirting with one another.

536
00:28:50,324 --> 00:28:51,324
What?

537
00:28:51,594 --> 00:28:53,433
When the tambourine flew their way,

538
00:28:53,433 --> 00:28:56,034
Mr. Oh got in front of her and took the hit.

539
00:28:56,203 --> 00:28:59,274
What was that famous old movie? The title was...

540
00:28:59,403 --> 00:29:00,673
Right, "The Bodyguard."

541
00:29:00,804 --> 00:29:03,903
It was like how the male lead took a bullet for the female lead.

542
00:29:03,903 --> 00:29:05,574
What nonsense is that?

543
00:29:06,873 --> 00:29:10,183
I clearly saw how the tambourine...

544
00:29:10,943 --> 00:29:13,153
flew straight at Mr. Oh's forehead.

545
00:29:13,153 --> 00:29:15,953
You probably saw wrong given how drunk you were.

546
00:29:15,953 --> 00:29:18,524
Mr. Oh took the hit to protect Ms. Kim.

547
00:29:18,853 --> 00:29:22,163
I don't care how easily false news spreads these days.

548
00:29:22,824 --> 00:29:24,524
How could you make up such nonsense...

549
00:29:24,824 --> 00:29:26,863
when we both saw what happened?

550
00:29:28,663 --> 00:29:31,703
Don't you dare say that to other people.

551
00:29:31,933 --> 00:29:34,873
There's no need to get all worked up about it.

552
00:29:36,844 --> 00:29:37,974
- Darn. - My gosh.

553
00:29:39,014 --> 00:29:40,143
Darn it.

554
00:29:40,643 --> 00:29:41,883
That cow.

555
00:29:42,344 --> 00:29:45,353
You can't just leave. You need to pay for the fishcake.

556
00:29:45,353 --> 00:29:47,183
Take it from my payment next month!

557
00:29:59,794 --> 00:30:01,734
I need that vixen gone.

558
00:30:02,903 --> 00:30:03,933
Darn.

559
00:30:04,334 --> 00:30:05,703
This has gone far enough.

560
00:30:14,943 --> 00:30:16,344
Are you here to get your hair done?

561
00:30:16,344 --> 00:30:18,754
I brought my granddaughter to get a haircut.

562
00:30:18,853 --> 00:30:20,254
Right. I'm glad you came.

563
00:30:24,054 --> 00:30:25,094
Please come in.

564
00:30:27,554 --> 00:30:28,824
All right.

565
00:30:33,234 --> 00:30:35,933
How would you like your hair done, little lady?

566
00:30:37,633 --> 00:30:38,774
I want to get a perm.

567
00:30:39,603 --> 00:30:41,574
Your mom said you couldn't do it, Eun Seo.

568
00:30:42,074 --> 00:30:44,443
It's my hair. Mom has no right to decide.

569
00:30:44,844 --> 00:30:47,413
If your mom says no, it's a no.

570
00:30:47,413 --> 00:30:48,613
I can't let you do it.

571
00:30:48,683 --> 00:30:50,383
Mom always does what she wants.

572
00:30:50,383 --> 00:30:51,883
Don't be like that to your mom.

573
00:30:52,413 --> 00:30:54,514
Mom isn't even interested in me.

574
00:30:55,554 --> 00:30:57,984
Please just trim her hair neatly.

575
00:30:58,423 --> 00:30:59,423
Okay.

576
00:31:03,463 --> 00:31:07,163
You can get a perm later when your mom allows it.

577
00:31:07,163 --> 00:31:09,034
I'll make you look pretty.

578
00:31:09,363 --> 00:31:10,433
Okay?

579
00:31:18,814 --> 00:31:20,113
Do you live in this neighborhood?

580
00:31:20,544 --> 00:31:22,084
I don't think I've seen you before.

581
00:31:22,084 --> 00:31:23,314
No.

582
00:31:23,314 --> 00:31:24,784
My daughter works here,

583
00:31:24,784 --> 00:31:26,653
so I was in the neighborhood.

584
00:31:26,683 --> 00:31:27,683
I see.

585
00:31:28,113 --> 00:31:30,183
All right. Let me see.

586
00:31:32,693 --> 00:31:34,423
You'll look pretty with short hair.

587
00:31:35,923 --> 00:31:36,923
Let me see.

588
00:31:38,064 --> 00:31:39,764
There you are.

589
00:31:40,294 --> 00:31:42,034
How sweet.

590
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:43,304
Here's your bunny.

591
00:31:55,044 --> 00:31:56,044
What?

592
00:31:57,744 --> 00:31:59,213
I think it's Professor Oh.

593
00:32:00,353 --> 00:32:01,683
Who is that baby?

594
00:32:04,383 --> 00:32:05,524
Hi, Seon Mi.

595
00:32:05,923 --> 00:32:08,393
Who is this cute baby?

596
00:32:09,224 --> 00:32:11,123
She's my daughter. Her name is Oh Ha Ni.

597
00:32:11,994 --> 00:32:14,564
Unbelievable. I thought you were single.

598
00:32:15,264 --> 00:32:17,234
She's so lovely.

599
00:32:17,564 --> 00:32:18,703
She's like an angel.

600
00:32:19,203 --> 00:32:21,403
I had no one to babysit her, so I had to bring her.

601
00:32:21,534 --> 00:32:22,673
If you don't mind,

602
00:32:22,673 --> 00:32:24,304
could you look after her during my lecture?

603
00:32:25,744 --> 00:32:28,984
The dean of the department asked me to do something,

604
00:32:28,984 --> 00:32:30,713
so I have to go to the administrative office now.

605
00:32:31,244 --> 00:32:32,484
Oh, I see.

606
00:32:36,084 --> 00:32:37,224
Where are you going?

607
00:32:38,853 --> 00:32:39,953
I'm going to my lecture.

608
00:32:40,353 --> 00:32:41,353
What about the baby?

609
00:32:41,353 --> 00:32:42,863
I'll ask the students to understand...

610
00:32:42,863 --> 00:32:44,423
and give a lecture with her in the room.

611
00:32:45,363 --> 00:32:48,163
This is Seoul, not California.

612
00:32:48,603 --> 00:32:49,663
Is it not acceptable?

613
00:32:50,903 --> 00:32:51,903
Hang on.

614
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:53,804
I'll find someone who can take care of her.

615
00:32:56,004 --> 00:32:57,844
I'll do it.

616
00:32:59,974 --> 00:33:01,374
Don't you have a class to take?

617
00:33:03,713 --> 00:33:06,184
No. I have some time in between my classes.

618
00:33:09,284 --> 00:33:11,383
I'll take good care of your baby.

619
00:33:11,383 --> 00:33:14,023
Please don't worry and give a lecture.

620
00:33:14,523 --> 00:33:16,224
Are you sure you're going to be okay?

621
00:33:17,224 --> 00:33:18,633
Of course.

622
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:20,363
I have many younger cousins,

623
00:33:20,363 --> 00:33:21,963
so I'm good with babies.

624
00:33:22,463 --> 00:33:25,034
I babysat them a lot when they were little.

625
00:33:25,434 --> 00:33:27,833
Se Ri is a model student, so she's good at everything.

626
00:33:27,833 --> 00:33:29,043
You don't have to worry.

627
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:31,374
I'll play with her after coming back from the administrative office.

628
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:34,113
Right. Don't worry and just leave her to me.

629
00:33:51,764 --> 00:33:53,363
I just changed her diaper,

630
00:33:53,363 --> 00:33:55,434
and it hasn't been long since I fed her, so she'll be fine.

631
00:33:55,963 --> 00:33:56,963
Okay.

632
00:33:57,104 --> 00:33:59,403
Still, if there's any problem,

633
00:33:59,403 --> 00:34:00,534
text me right away.

634
00:34:00,934 --> 00:34:01,943
I'll ask the students...

635
00:34:01,943 --> 00:34:03,374
for their understanding and check it.

636
00:34:03,773 --> 00:34:06,874
I technically raised all my cousins.

637
00:34:07,374 --> 00:34:08,613
Don't worry.

638
00:34:08,983 --> 00:34:10,784
All right. Thank you.

639
00:34:11,954 --> 00:34:14,653
By the way, what is your name again?

640
00:34:15,014 --> 00:34:16,454
I'm Dokgo Se Ri.

641
00:34:16,824 --> 00:34:18,554
Thank you, Se Ri.

642
00:34:19,023 --> 00:34:20,023
Sure.

643
00:34:20,793 --> 00:34:23,664
Ha Ni, I'll be back after giving a lecture.

644
00:34:23,664 --> 00:34:25,764
Have fun with Se Ri, okay?

645
00:34:26,764 --> 00:34:29,633
"Yes, Dad. I'll see you later."

646
00:34:29,633 --> 00:34:31,363
Say that to your dad, Ha Ni.

647
00:34:34,333 --> 00:34:36,003
I'll see you later then.

648
00:34:36,874 --> 00:34:38,304
Okay.

649
00:34:47,854 --> 00:34:49,054
I was so nervous.

650
00:34:54,124 --> 00:34:56,664
It's nice to meet you, Ha Ni.

651
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:00,063
Actually,

652
00:35:00,563 --> 00:35:02,233
I lied to your dad...

653
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:03,863
to get on his good side.

654
00:35:04,563 --> 00:35:07,773
I've never seen such a small baby like you before.

655
00:35:08,204 --> 00:35:10,574
So please don't cry.

656
00:35:10,644 --> 00:35:12,744
Let's have fun together.

657
00:35:12,744 --> 00:35:14,273
Okay?

658
00:35:16,043 --> 00:35:17,583
Gosh, look at her.

659
00:35:18,914 --> 00:35:22,224
She sleeps like a princess.

660
00:35:25,124 --> 00:35:26,193
Hello, Ms. Jang.

661
00:35:26,554 --> 00:35:27,923
Hey, it's been a while.

662
00:35:27,923 --> 00:35:30,594
Am I calling you when you're busy at work?

663
00:35:30,724 --> 00:35:33,034
It's all right. Is something wrong?

664
00:35:33,193 --> 00:35:34,633
It's no big deal.

665
00:35:34,994 --> 00:35:38,063
I'm on my way to Jinhae for my relative's wedding.

666
00:35:38,563 --> 00:35:39,903
So I was wondering...

667
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:42,474
if you'd have some time to see me.

668
00:35:43,403 --> 00:35:45,104
If you're busy, I can just go back.

669
00:35:45,344 --> 00:35:47,443
No. You came all the way here.

670
00:35:47,443 --> 00:35:48,644
I'd love to see you.

671
00:35:50,244 --> 00:35:53,684
I didn't want to bother you when you were busy,

672
00:35:53,713 --> 00:35:56,383
but I'd be too upset if I came back without seeing you.

673
00:35:57,324 --> 00:35:59,293
I'll be there in a couple of hours.

674
00:35:59,293 --> 00:36:00,923
I'll call you when I get there.

675
00:36:00,923 --> 00:36:01,923
I'll see you then.

676
00:36:01,923 --> 00:36:03,693
Okay. I'll see you soon.

677
00:36:07,733 --> 00:36:11,434
I have to meet him and settle things today.

678
00:36:19,574 --> 00:36:22,414
The waves are a bit rough for the training,

679
00:36:22,414 --> 00:36:24,043
but not bad enough to cancel it.

680
00:36:25,854 --> 00:36:28,514
Let's start with safety as our top priority.

681
00:36:28,514 --> 00:36:29,724
Yes, sir.

682
00:36:33,153 --> 00:36:35,923
All right. This is a training where you go into the water in pairs,

683
00:36:35,923 --> 00:36:38,164
get to the target point underwater,

684
00:36:38,164 --> 00:36:39,733
install the explosives,

685
00:36:39,733 --> 00:36:41,733
and return safely.

686
00:36:42,264 --> 00:36:44,833
Safety is the top priority in training.

687
00:36:45,164 --> 00:36:48,003
Make sure to look out for each other throughout the operation.

688
00:36:48,104 --> 00:36:51,374
Keep in mind that the safety of your partner is your safety.

689
00:36:53,443 --> 00:36:55,173
All right. Let's begin.

690
00:37:03,883 --> 00:37:04,923
Jang Soo.

691
00:37:05,153 --> 00:37:08,293
Today might be the last training for me.

692
00:37:09,523 --> 00:37:11,264
Even if I leave the sea,

693
00:37:11,363 --> 00:37:13,394
there will be other waves again.

694
00:37:14,063 --> 00:37:15,293
But I'll try again.

695
00:37:15,934 --> 00:37:17,534
Watch over me from above, Jang Soo.

696
00:37:40,124 --> 00:37:41,653
(Eagle Brewery Unrefined Makgeolli)

697
00:37:49,503 --> 00:37:51,003
Do you need help checking in?

698
00:37:51,133 --> 00:37:52,673
That's not what I'm here for.

699
00:37:53,003 --> 00:37:55,574
I'm here to meet Chairman Han Dong Seok.

700
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:57,043
Do you have an appointment?

701
00:37:58,043 --> 00:38:00,844
No. I don't have an appointment,

702
00:38:00,844 --> 00:38:03,613
but I'd like to meet him and talk to him briefly.

703
00:38:04,483 --> 00:38:05,514
Yes.

704
00:38:10,923 --> 00:38:11,923
(Chairman Han Dong Seok)

705
00:38:11,923 --> 00:38:14,624
Ma Kwang Sook of Eagle Brewery is here to meet you.

706
00:38:14,624 --> 00:38:16,324
I got a call from the front desk.

707
00:38:18,023 --> 00:38:20,133
I'm reviewing the documents.

708
00:38:21,693 --> 00:38:23,003
Yes. All right.

709
00:38:25,133 --> 00:38:28,074
Chairman Han is not available today, so I'm afraid you can't meet him.

710
00:38:28,534 --> 00:38:30,344
I see. He must be busy.

711
00:38:31,003 --> 00:38:33,173
I wanted to thank him in person.

712
00:38:33,213 --> 00:38:34,613
I'll visit him later.

713
00:38:43,224 --> 00:38:44,324
We meet again.

714
00:38:44,324 --> 00:38:46,693
I know. We meet often, right?

715
00:38:47,293 --> 00:38:49,063
What brings you here?

716
00:38:49,124 --> 00:38:50,824
I'm here to sign a contract.

717
00:38:51,863 --> 00:38:53,994
You're signing the supply contract already?

718
00:38:53,994 --> 00:38:55,494
It's not a formal contract.

719
00:38:55,494 --> 00:38:57,304
It's just a temporary contract today.

720
00:38:57,463 --> 00:39:00,233
We'll improve what needs to be fixed and proceed with the supply.

721
00:39:01,534 --> 00:39:02,874
That's good news.

722
00:39:03,503 --> 00:39:04,503
Congratulations.

723
00:39:04,503 --> 00:39:06,543
Thank you for congratulating me.

724
00:39:06,543 --> 00:39:09,184
Let's talk more later then.

725
00:39:09,844 --> 00:39:12,014
I don't think I'll be seeing you again.

726
00:39:15,414 --> 00:39:18,483
I haven't reviewed the proposal you gave me last time,

727
00:39:19,094 --> 00:39:22,153
but I don't think I can give you the answer you want anyway.

728
00:39:23,023 --> 00:39:26,293
Our new product Jang-Kwang Makgeolli is well received in the market,

729
00:39:27,094 --> 00:39:30,063
so I won't be selling the brewery.

730
00:39:32,204 --> 00:39:34,903
You never know how things will turn out in life.

731
00:39:35,133 --> 00:39:36,943
Don't be too certain.

732
00:39:37,644 --> 00:39:39,974
Just take your time and review it carefully.

733
00:39:40,713 --> 00:39:41,713
Okay.

734
00:39:42,074 --> 00:39:44,344
But I won't be doing that for the time being.

735
00:39:45,113 --> 00:39:46,483
Maybe later.

736
00:39:47,253 --> 00:39:49,753
When I have some time to spare,

737
00:39:50,753 --> 00:39:51,983
I'll try to read it.

738
00:40:10,874 --> 00:40:13,443
It's been a while. Is everything going well?

739
00:40:13,574 --> 00:40:15,344
Thanks to you, I've been doing fine.

740
00:40:15,344 --> 00:40:16,414
And...

741
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:19,514
your wife always takes good care of my daughter,

742
00:40:19,514 --> 00:40:21,854
so I'm very grateful for that.

743
00:40:21,854 --> 00:40:24,083
Bom is like our daughter, you know.

744
00:40:24,083 --> 00:40:25,594
We go way back.

745
00:40:26,793 --> 00:40:29,463
And we think of Gyeol as our son.

746
00:40:29,463 --> 00:40:31,494
Thank you for saying that.

747
00:40:31,863 --> 00:40:34,833
I heard you had a meeting at our hotel.

748
00:40:34,833 --> 00:40:37,863
I met a buyer at the coffee shop here,

749
00:40:37,863 --> 00:40:40,273
and decided to drop by to see you...

750
00:40:40,273 --> 00:40:41,673
as we haven't met in a while.

751
00:40:42,204 --> 00:40:43,443
I'm glad you did.

752
00:40:43,443 --> 00:40:44,503
- Please. - Thanks.

753
00:40:56,724 --> 00:41:00,153
I happened to meet in the hotel lobby...

754
00:41:00,354 --> 00:41:03,724
Eagle Brewery's new female CEO.

755
00:41:04,094 --> 00:41:08,594
She bragged about supplying her makgeolli to LX Hotel.

756
00:41:09,264 --> 00:41:10,333
Oh, that?

757
00:41:10,863 --> 00:41:14,374
I believe my staff are considering it.

758
00:41:16,374 --> 00:41:19,313
Then what about my Silla Brewery?

759
00:41:21,113 --> 00:41:25,344
I left the decision completely up to the executives in charge.

760
00:41:27,813 --> 00:41:30,583
Yes, you should. That's very right.

761
00:41:31,784 --> 00:41:36,724
But you don't know my industry.

762
00:41:36,963 --> 00:41:40,264
If I may inform you out of concern...

763
00:41:46,673 --> 00:41:48,273
There's a rumor...

764
00:41:48,474 --> 00:41:51,903
that Eagle Brewery is about to go belly-up.

765
00:41:54,043 --> 00:41:55,313
"Belly-up?"

766
00:41:56,313 --> 00:41:58,543
Their finances are in shambles.

767
00:41:59,253 --> 00:42:03,354
They're almost unable to pay the interest...

768
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:05,023
to the loans they took out.

769
00:42:07,153 --> 00:42:08,394
Why do you think...

770
00:42:09,994 --> 00:42:11,863
the widow of the last CEO...

771
00:42:13,034 --> 00:42:16,363
would take over a failing brewery when they were only married...

772
00:42:16,363 --> 00:42:18,333
for ten days?

773
00:42:25,844 --> 00:42:26,874
The talk is that...

774
00:42:27,914 --> 00:42:30,744
she took over the brewery...

775
00:42:30,813 --> 00:42:34,284
because there were hidden assets such as property.

776
00:42:35,054 --> 00:42:38,153
On top of that, the woman's so greedy,

777
00:42:38,253 --> 00:42:41,454
she's fighting her brothers-in-law over the inheritance.

778
00:42:45,363 --> 00:42:47,094
There are such rumors?

779
00:42:47,494 --> 00:42:48,963
Once the assets are split,

780
00:42:49,604 --> 00:42:52,874
Eagle Brewery will disappear.

781
00:42:53,903 --> 00:42:56,273
It's in a state where it's almost impossible to operate.

782

783
00:43:01,844 --> 00:43:04,543
I'll tell my team to look into it.

784
00:43:05,684 --> 00:43:09,184
It's just your luck that I met the brewery's CEO,

785
00:43:09,483 --> 00:43:11,923
or you could've suffered a loss.

Stop crying.

805
00:44:40,403 --> 00:44:42,743
Hey. She stopped crying.

806
00:44:43,412 --> 00:44:45,713
Did you cry because you felt stuffy?

807
00:44:45,982 --> 00:44:48,812

810
00:44:53,952 --> 00:44:56,622
I'll define "bounded rationality."

811
00:44:57,522 --> 00:44:59,022
Bounded rationality refers to...

812
00:44:59,463 --> 00:45:01,892
cases where the scale of a problem a person must solve...

813
00:45:01,892 --> 00:45:04,232
exceeds their capacity to solve it,

814
00:45:04,863 --> 00:45:07,562

On average, there are about 50 to 60.

843
00:47:34,142 --> 00:47:35,283
That's impressive.

845
00:47:38,153 --> 00:47:39,883
It's fine. It wasn't serious.

00:48:01,872 --> 00:48:03,573
I put some ointment on. It'll be fine.

908
00:51:28,653 --> 00:51:31,383
Yes, of course. I fully understand.

909
00:51:31,852 --> 00:51:34,452
If you find it a challenge,

910
00:51:34,452 --> 00:51:37,493
we can have LX's design team assist you.

911
00:51:37,653 --> 00:51:39,423
That was suggested by the chairman.

912
00:51:39,423 --> 00:51:41,732
I'd highly appreciate that.

913
00:51:42,263 --> 00:51:45,162
I never thought the chairman would be this attentive.

914
00:51:45,162 --> 00:51:46,662
I'm touched.

915
00:51:47,002 --> 00:51:49,232
Take your time reading the contract and sign it with your seal.

916
00:52:07,952 --> 00:52:08,952
Mister.

917
00:52:08,952 --> 00:52:11,562
I mean, Chairman Han!

918
00:52:15,832 --> 00:52:18,633
I just signed the contract.

919
00:52:18,633 --> 00:52:20,102
Thank you so much.

920
00:52:21,732 --> 00:52:24,133
The decision was made by the experts at the hotel.

921
00:52:24,133 --> 00:52:25,602
There's no need to thank me.

922
00:52:25,973 --> 00:52:28,743
Come on. I heard from your employees...

923
00:52:28,743 --> 00:52:29,743
that you, mister...

924
00:52:30,142 --> 00:52:33,783
You, as the chairman, recommended Jang-Kwang Makgeolli.

925
00:52:34,812 --> 00:52:36,482
I truly appreciate it.

926
00:52:37,213 --> 00:52:38,582
By the way, are you free?

927
00:52:40,053 --> 00:52:42,593
You granted me the opportunity to sign a contract this huge,

928
00:52:42,593 --> 00:52:44,752
and I'd like to at least buy you coffee.

929
00:52:44,752 --> 00:52:46,522
Please spare some of your time for me.

930
00:52:46,863 --> 00:52:48,232
I'll consider myself treated.

931
00:52:49,732 --> 00:52:52,062
I don't feel comfortable, that's all.

932
00:52:52,062 --> 00:52:54,403
You gifted me with something this huge,

933
00:52:54,403 --> 00:52:56,133
and I should at least treat you to coffee.

934
00:52:56,133 --> 00:52:58,403
It'd be wrong of me not to thank you.

935
00:52:58,702 --> 00:52:59,743
I'm good.

936
00:53:00,372 --> 00:53:02,613
Besides, I was on my way to grab a meal.

937
00:53:02,613 --> 00:53:03,613
Okay, then.

938
00:53:09,213 --> 00:53:11,653
As if there's any need to give me the cold shoulder.

939
00:53:25,033 --> 00:53:26,463
I have a question.

940
00:53:27,062 --> 00:53:28,133
Do you...

941
00:53:28,673 --> 00:53:29,973
have a twin brother?

942
00:53:32,473 --> 00:53:34,473
Who? Me?

943
00:53:34,772 --> 00:53:35,812
Yes.

944
00:53:35,872 --> 00:53:37,843
When we first met,

945
00:53:37,843 --> 00:53:40,182
you were in a doorman's uniform.

946
00:53:40,182 --> 00:53:41,213
That...

947
00:53:42,252 --> 00:53:44,713
I was dressed as a doorman because we were filming something...

948
00:53:44,713 --> 00:53:46,553
for a TV show.

949
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:49,553
I see.

950
00:53:52,792 --> 00:53:54,463
For a TV show?

951
00:53:55,162 --> 00:53:57,193
You should've given me a heads-up.

952
00:53:57,562 --> 00:54:00,932
I had no idea and behaved inappropriately.

953
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:06,073
It's a bit too late, but I'd like to apologize.

954
00:54:06,973 --> 00:54:08,973
I really was clueless,

955
00:54:08,973 --> 00:54:11,682
so please forget about everything I said or did.

956
00:54:17,412 --> 00:54:18,423
By the way,

957
00:54:19,153 --> 00:54:21,383
do you always eat alone?

958
00:54:23,493 --> 00:54:25,863
I quietly eat alone if there's no other business.

959
00:54:27,863 --> 00:54:29,993
As if it's any fun to eat alone.

960
00:54:30,662 --> 00:54:32,633
One needs company...

961
00:54:32,633 --> 00:54:33,863
for anything to be tasty.

962
00:54:35,033 --> 00:54:36,403
Do you want me to join you?

963
00:54:37,202 --> 00:54:38,673
I'll decline.

964
00:54:42,473 --> 00:54:43,912
I have to ask.

965
00:54:44,412 --> 00:54:48,013
Was it you who had me invited...

966
00:54:48,013 --> 00:54:49,752
to the MVG Club dinner party?

967
00:54:51,682 --> 00:54:55,193
No wonder I was served all that expensive champagne...

968
00:54:55,193 --> 00:54:56,952
and was treated like a VIP guest.

969
00:54:57,752 --> 00:55:00,223
I was compensating you for the free makgeolli,

970
00:55:01,323 --> 00:55:04,493
so don't blow it out of proportion thinking that you're someone...

971
00:55:05,002 --> 00:55:06,763
I've been pulling the strings for.

972
00:55:12,903 --> 00:55:14,042
Are you done?

973
00:55:14,573 --> 00:55:16,013
But you haven't even finished half of it.

974
00:55:20,243 --> 00:55:21,283
Always so prickly.

975
00:55:22,582 --> 00:55:24,653
Chairman Han, hold on.

976
00:55:34,022 --> 00:55:35,732
Have a good day, Chairman Han!

977
00:55:40,562 --> 00:55:42,832
Please drive safely on the road...

978
00:55:42,832 --> 00:55:45,202
and take good care of the chairman.

979
00:55:45,843 --> 00:55:47,372
Right, sure.

980
00:55:52,383 --> 00:55:55,482
The talk is that she took over the brewery...

981
00:55:55,653 --> 00:55:59,352
because there were hidden assets such as property.

982
00:56:00,122 --> 00:56:02,923
On top of that, the woman's so greedy,

983
00:56:02,923 --> 00:56:05,923
she's fighting her brothers-in-law over the inheritance.

984
00:56:08,392 --> 00:56:10,193
Have a good day, sir.

985
00:56:14,963 --> 00:56:16,973
Good job, Ma Kwang Sook.

986
00:56:19,403 --> 00:56:22,542
This is the least I can do for my career.

987
00:56:25,513 --> 00:56:26,613
Have a good day.

988
00:56:30,312 --> 00:56:31,723
Ha Ni, Daddy's back.

989
00:56:56,443 --> 00:56:58,843
I guess I dozed off while putting Ha Ni to sleep.

990
00:57:01,412 --> 00:57:02,653
I bet it was a hassle.

991
00:57:03,852 --> 00:57:05,352
Hardly.

992
00:57:05,352 --> 00:57:08,522
Ha Ni was such an angel that I had no trouble at all.

993
00:57:08,693 --> 00:57:10,093
Thank you for today.

994
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:11,923
I'll treat you to a delicious meal next time.

995
00:57:12,662 --> 00:57:13,823
It's all right.

996
00:57:14,662 --> 00:57:15,963
By the way, Professor Oh,

997
00:57:16,533 --> 00:57:18,863
since I'm one of your students,

998
00:57:19,533 --> 00:57:21,303
you can speak comfortably with me.

999
00:57:21,363 --> 00:57:24,173
Please address me as you would the teaching assistant.

1000
00:57:25,542 --> 00:57:27,142
Maybe I should.

1001
00:57:27,903 --> 00:57:31,312
Anyway, thank you for today, Se Ri.

1002
00:57:34,513 --> 00:57:35,883
Ha Ni's asleep, so I guess...

1003
00:57:35,883 --> 00:57:37,452
I'll have to leave without saying goodbye.

1004
00:57:40,852 --> 00:57:42,693
I'll get going, then.

1005
00:58:05,073 --> 00:58:06,843
"Thank you for today, Se Ri."

1006
00:58:11,053 --> 00:58:12,082
Yes!

1007
00:58:15,252 --> 00:58:16,522
- You're here. - Hey.

1008
00:58:16,923 --> 00:58:19,363
I got held up checking inventory.

1009
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:20,763
I hope I didn't keep you waiting too long.

1010
00:58:20,763 --> 00:58:22,392
Hardly. Have a seat.

1011
00:58:22,392 --> 00:58:23,463
Right.

1012
00:58:25,803 --> 00:58:27,303
I'm the one who's sorry...

1013
00:58:27,303 --> 00:58:28,932
for insisting to see someone who's busy.

1014
00:58:29,303 --> 00:58:30,403
It's all right.

1015
00:58:31,073 --> 00:58:32,202
Should we have some tea, then?

1016
00:58:32,403 --> 00:58:33,403
Sure.

1017
00:58:36,872 --> 00:58:38,073
- Mission complete! - Mission complete!

1018
00:58:48,452 --> 00:58:50,593
- Why is it just you? - He got swept away by the current.

1019
00:58:50,792 --> 00:58:51,993
I followed him right away...

1020
00:58:51,993 --> 00:58:52,993
but couldn't get a clear view,

1021
00:58:52,993 --> 00:58:54,162
which is why I came up to report the emergency.

1022
00:58:54,162 --> 00:58:55,193
What?

1023
00:58:55,633 --> 00:58:56,693
My gear.

1024
00:59:25,693 --> 00:59:27,662
If your mother were still alive,

1025
00:59:28,022 --> 00:59:30,093
we could've had this conversation more comfortably.

1026
00:59:30,832 --> 00:59:34,162
It feels awkward to talk to you about this in person.

1027
00:59:34,332 --> 00:59:37,002
It's okay. You can speak freely.

1028
00:59:39,772 --> 00:59:41,502
What do you think of my Se Ri?

1029
00:59:42,243 --> 00:59:43,312
Pardon?

1030
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:46,912
I've been getting calls...

1031
00:59:47,443 --> 00:59:51,153
from people who'd like her to be their daughter-in-law.

1032
00:59:52,423 --> 00:59:55,723
But for a long time, I've wondered...

1033
00:59:55,723 --> 00:59:58,792
what it would be like if you married her.

1034
01:00:00,122 --> 01:00:04,133
Of course, I'm only saying this because I think she likes you too.

1035
01:00:05,133 --> 01:00:07,403
I was going to tell you once I got discharged.

1036
01:00:08,202 --> 01:00:10,272
But instead, I made you come all this way.

1037
01:00:11,832 --> 01:00:12,843
I...

1038
01:00:16,142 --> 01:00:17,443
have feelings for Se Ri.

1039
01:00:19,682 --> 01:00:20,682
You do, right?

1040
01:00:21,343 --> 01:00:24,213
You're interested in her too, aren't you?

1041
01:00:24,312 --> 01:00:27,883
I'd thought of her as another sister since she was Bom's friend.

1042
01:00:28,952 --> 01:00:32,423
But before I knew it, I started having feelings for her.

1043
01:00:32,923 --> 01:00:34,993
My hunch was right.

1044
01:00:35,292 --> 01:00:36,732
We grew up like siblings,

1045
01:00:36,792 --> 01:00:40,202
so I was waiting for the right time to bring up the subject properly.

1046
01:00:40,763 --> 01:00:42,332
If you and your husband approve,

1047
01:00:42,673 --> 01:00:44,903
I'd like to date Se Ri seriously.

1048
01:00:47,473 --> 01:00:49,113
If you like each other,

1049
01:00:49,113 --> 01:00:51,613
my husband and I have no reason to object.

1050
01:00:51,613 --> 01:00:53,182
This is welcome news.

1051
01:00:55,783 --> 01:00:56,812
But...

1052
01:00:57,252 --> 01:00:59,982
to be honest, I don't know how Se Ri feels.

1053
01:01:00,252 --> 01:01:01,553
I know my daughter well.

1054
01:01:02,452 --> 01:01:05,022
She thinks immensely of you.

1055
01:01:05,622 --> 01:01:06,622
Does she?

1056
01:01:08,263 --> 01:01:12,432
You're both so naive because you studied all your lives.

1057
01:01:14,863 --> 01:01:18,602
I need you to take control and lead her.

1058
01:01:19,073 --> 01:01:21,002
Se Ri's an adult,

1059
01:01:21,002 --> 01:01:23,673
but she's a spoiled princess who knows nothing of the world.

1060
01:01:23,973 --> 01:01:26,582
Okay. Once I'm discharged and I return to Seoul,

1061
01:01:26,943 --> 01:01:30,352
I'll take control and the lead as a big brother and a man.

1062
01:01:30,613 --> 01:01:31,653
My gosh.

1063
01:01:32,723 --> 01:01:33,723
Thank you.

1064
01:01:34,383 --> 01:01:37,053
Thank you for loving my Se Ri.

1065
01:01:37,423 --> 01:01:38,553
Don't say that.

1066
01:01:38,993 --> 01:01:40,122
I should thank you.

1067
01:01:48,133 --> 01:01:50,073
Doctor. We have an emergency.

1068
01:01:51,403 --> 01:01:53,743
It looks urgent. You should go.

1069
01:01:53,943 --> 01:01:55,513
Sorry. I'll see you in Seoul.

1070
01:01:55,513 --> 01:01:56,613
- Okay. - Bye.

1071
01:02:12,792 --> 01:02:13,792
Lieutenant Oh Kang Soo?

1072
01:02:15,263 --> 01:02:18,263
There was a mishap during the underwater explosion training.

1073
01:02:18,463 --> 01:02:20,303
One injured soldier's regaining consciousness.

1074
01:02:20,303 --> 01:02:22,473
The other has a head laceration on the right.

1075
01:02:22,473 --> 01:02:24,332
He's bleeding excessively and is unconscious.

1076
01:02:24,772 --> 01:02:25,903
- Let's go. - Okay.

1077
01:02:43,093 --> 01:02:45,892
(Restricted Area)

1078
01:03:31,573 --> 01:03:34,073
(For Eagle Brothers)

1079
01:03:34,343 --> 01:03:37,142
Do you recognize me?

1080
01:03:37,412 --> 01:03:39,482
Why don't you recognize me? I'm your third older brother.

1081
01:03:39,613 --> 01:03:40,613
Kwang Sook.

1082
01:03:40,783 --> 01:03:42,042
Food.

1083
01:03:42,042 --> 01:03:44,013
Can you quit asking for food?

1084
01:03:44,352 --> 01:03:47,153
Can't you let it go on a day like this?

1085
01:03:47,153 --> 01:03:48,823
