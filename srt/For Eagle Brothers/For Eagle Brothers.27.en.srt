1
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:03,310
Do you...

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:05,140
have...

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,750
feelings for me?

4
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:14,920
It's stupid, isn't it?

5
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,390
I must've briefly lost my mind.

6
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:19,590
Sorry. Pretend you didn't hear me.

7
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:21,990
You're right.

8
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,400
I'm right?

9
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:30,670
Yes, you're right.

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,870
I have feelings for you.

11
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,450
Yes, of course.

12
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,590
As your hotel's supplier,

13
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:50,690
you consider Eagle Brewery as...

14
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:52,190
This goes beyond that.

15
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:55,430
I have romantic feelings for you.

16
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:00,330
Why would you make
such a terrifying joke?

17
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:02,100
It's not a joke. I mean it.

18
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,300
My gosh. Goodness me. That's insane.

19
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,470
Where do you think you're going?

20
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,440
My head just started ringing.

21
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,650
I think
I should wrap things up for now.

22
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:15,910
CEO Ma. Hold on.

23
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,620
(Eagle Brewery)

24
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,700
What on earth did I just hear?

25
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:38,600
This is ridiculous.

26
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,170
I shouldn't have asked.

27
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:44,410
I shouldn't have asked!

28
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,020
Ever since it was exposed...

29
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,020
that an executive at Silla Brewery
orchestrated the attack,

30
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:01,460
the market and public opinion
have been scathing.

31
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:04,500
How about you apologize publicly...

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,600
and show your remorse...

33
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,800
to Eagle Brewery
in an official capacity?

34
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:12,070
What are you saying?

35
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,140
Why should I apologize
for something my subordinate did?

36
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,340
What's the point in distinguishing
whether one man...

37
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,610
or a whole company is responsible?

38
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,410
If your subordinate was corrupt,

39
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,890
you're partially responsible
as the CEO who hired them.

40
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,390
I heard he fled abroad.

41
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,820
Your company
doesn't have to suffer...

42
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,990
the criticism until he's caught.

43
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:38,130
You also have a duty
to explain away...

44
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,600
the misunderstanding
you caused Eagle Brewery.

45
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,140
May I ask why...

46
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,270
you're so involved in this issue?

47
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,240
What ties do you have...

48
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,680
with Eagle Brewery
that you're doing this?

49
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,280
I don't get it, to be honest.

50
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,890
Eagle Brewery is my supplier
and business partner,

51
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:04,390
and I selected their product
and decided to buy it.

52
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:08,290
Their reputation is mine also.

53
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,300
Is that all it is?

54
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:18,000
What answer were you expecting
or hoping for?

55
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:20,570
Well,

56
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,780
you're not the Chairman Han
I used to know.

57
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,610
I asked out of bewilderment.

58
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:29,610
Don't you think...

59
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,820
we should avoid doing something
our children would be ashamed of?

60
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:38,660
Think about it carefully.

61
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:44,000
Thank you for listening to
an uncomfortable suggestion.

62
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,760
I'll see myself out.

63
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:56,980
I should avoid doing something
my child would be ashamed of?

64
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:03,080
How dare you lecture me?

65
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,190
(Eagle Brewery Unrefined Makgeolli)

66
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,830
Yes, you're right.

67
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,800
I have feelings for you.

68
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,510
I just asked
because I couldn't believe it.

69
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,110
Ma Kwang Sook.

70
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,780
Why on earth
did you ask such a thing?

71
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,620
How am I to face him now?

72
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,470
What are you doing out here?

73
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,310
I was resting a bit
to recover from a headache.

74
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,030
Where are you going?

75
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,570
I took a long enough break.

76
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,430
I should get back to protesting.

77
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:36,870
(Silla Brewery Dokgo Tak,
Apologize for the fake video)

78
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,480
You don't have to protest.

79
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,480
What?

80
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,750
I told you...

81
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,920
I'd make Dokgo Tak apologize.

82
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:51,790
Chairman Dokgo...

83
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:54,660
will call a press conference
to apologize soon.

84
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:57,660
Will he really?

85
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,330
I only say what I mean
and what is true.

86
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:03,630
Thank you, Chairman Han.

87
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,370
I won't forget what you did for me.

88
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:09,210
Oh, dear.

89
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,310
You know,

90
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:14,680
I always keep my word.

91
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,520
I'll get back to work, then.

92
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:24,890
I solved a huge problem for you.

93
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:26,860
"Thank you."

94
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,030
"I'll never forget it."
They're just empty words.

95
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,130
What?

96
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:37,300
Can't you at least buy me
bean sprout soup and rice?

97
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,900
Bean sprout soup and rice?

98
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,980
I left home before breakfast
to stop by here before work.

99
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,920
Oh, my gosh.

100
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,390
Chairman Han!

101
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:57,460
My goodness.

102
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:03,530
Come in.

103
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,200
How are things right now?

104
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,130
I asked security.

105
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,270
The woman who was protesting...

106
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:14,010
packed up and left.

107
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:15,310
Goodness.

108
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,610
It's as if that woman
and Chairman Han are in cahoots.

109
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,010
Hello, it's me.

110
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,120
Hello, ma'am.

111
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:25,650
You can go.

112
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,690
What are you doing here
out of the blue?

113
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,830
I did some thinking after you left.

114
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:37,360
Don't make things worse.

115
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,200
Apologize to Eagle Brewery
and end it.

116
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,500
My gosh.

117
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,330
Why do you...

118
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:45,400
and Chairman Han both
want me to apologize?

119
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:47,340
Why is no one on my side?

120
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:48,940
What do you mean?

121
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,410
Chairman Han told you to apologize?

122
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:53,680
He was here just now.

123
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:55,510
He lectured me...

124
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:57,550
and told me
to apologize to the public.

125
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,920
I couldn't stand it.

126
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:04,120
I'd have headbutted him
if only our kids weren't engaged.

127
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,920
How did he know what happened?

128
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:10,190
His hotel
serves Eagle Brewery's makgeolli.

129
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,700
Do as Chairman Han says,
whatever the cost.

130
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:16,400
- What?
- Don't you want to marry Se Ri off?

131
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:21,040
Se Ri's a smart and pretty girl.

132
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,410
He should be grateful...

133
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:24,880
that he could ever get her
as a daughter-in-law.

134
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,050
Why do we have to bow
and grovel all the time?

135
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:31,880
You caused this disaster
because you got too greedy.

136
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,750
How many times must I tell you?

137
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,250
I had nothing to do with this!

138
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:39,820
Director Seo went and did it
behind my back!

139
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,030
What is it?

140
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,170
What?

141
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,440
Since you lie so much,
I expect you to be better at it.

142
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:56,410
Then and now,

143
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,210
you're still so transparent
when you try to lie.

144
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,380
What?

145
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,780
Stupid people like you...

146
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,080
should never lie and obey the law.

147
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,590
How dare you talk like that to me?

148
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,690
If Se Ri's marriage falls through
because of you,

149
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,820
I'll divorce you, and that's final!

150
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,760
What the heck?

151
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,230
Oh, my gosh.

152
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,070
If only...

153
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,110
they'd handed over
the brewery to us,

154
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,680
none of this would've happened.

155
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:34,380
It's all on Ma Kwang Sook,

156
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:36,710
that darn viper.

157
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:53,360
Enjoy your meal.

158
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:56,030
Let's eat quick and leave.

159
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,840
Why won't you eat?

160
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,450
Cool it for me.

161
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,290
What?

162
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,150
You cooled it for me last time.

163
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,590
That's hot.

164
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:23,790
I see you require a lot of care.

165
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,170
I spoiled him rotten.

166
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,120
Did you think about it?

167
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:45,720
About what?

168
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,150
About what I said earlier.

169
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,490
Stop joking about and eat your food.

170
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,430
Why do you act
as if I crack jokes all the time?

171
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,300
I wasn't kidding. I was serious.

172
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:09,170
You must know so many cool
and amazing women.

173
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,680
Why would you like me?

174
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:13,880
Do you lack...

175
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,580
that much self-esteem?

176
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:22,690
I do know...

177
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:26,020
I look good enough
that I shouldn't be intimidated.

178
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,860
You're not that beautiful.

179
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,760
I'm so cheerful and energetic...

180
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,570
that people say
I have the spirit of a strong woman,

181
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,370
and they often praise me
for being upbeat...

182
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:40,400
As I said last time,

183
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,510
you're not dislikable,

184
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,410
but you are a nuisance.

185
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:49,050
I empathize with others...

186
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,620
quickly and easily,

187
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,920
and I help people feel at ease
most of the time.

188
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:58,190
You might find it attractive too.

189
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:59,290
You are...

190
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,030
the woman who swears better
than anyone...

191
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:05,260
I've ever met.

192
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,530
Then why do you like me?

193
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:12,340
Because it's you.

194
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,910
What?

195
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:18,040
I don't like you
for any special reason.

196
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,850
I just like you because it's you.

197
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,220
Because you're Ma Kwang Sook.

198
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,690
That's why.

199
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,160
What...

200
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,360
What does this response mean?

201
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:44,700
I have something urgent to do,
so I think I should get going first.

202
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,870
Please finish your meal.

203
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,910
I'm not done talking.

204
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:51,940
No. I don't think I should hear it.

205
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,710
I'm leaving.

206
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,080
My goodness.

207
00:12:58,650 --> 00:12:59,720
What was that?

208
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:03,090
I finally made up my mind
to tell her about my feelings.

209
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,430
Kwang Sook.

210
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,030
Where did you go so early
in the morning?

211
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,470
Well...

212
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,940
I went to Silla Brewery
for a one-man protest.

213
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:21,670
Why did you go alone
without consulting me?

214
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,610
I'm the one who should be
doing the one-man protest.

215
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,280
I'll do it starting tomorrow.

216
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:27,410
We don't have to go anymore.

217
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:28,810
Why not?

218
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:32,280
Well... Chairman Dokgo Tak says...

219
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,390
he will make a public apology soon.

220
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:36,920
Really?

221
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:39,920
Yes. He says
he's going to do it soon.

222
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,890
I'll make Dokgo Tak
apologize to you.

223
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,030
So stop doing this.

224
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,870
- Are you feeling hot?
- What?

225
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:55,410
It's not even hot,
but you keep fanning yourself.

226
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,840
Well...

227
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,440
You're right.

228
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,410
Did I get heatstroke
during the one-man protest?

229
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,420
Hello, Mr. Go.

230
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,690
Did something happen to Mi Sun?

231
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,400
Why?

232
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,430
I stopped by the convenience store
on my way here,

233
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:21,870
but I haven't seen her
since yesterday.

234
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:25,640
Actually, I was worried,
so I left a voicemail,

235
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:26,740
but I haven't heard back.

236
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:29,470
Is she sick?

237
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:45,560
The phone is turned off.
Transferring to voicemail.

238
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,690
Your call may be charged
after the tone.

239
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:52,530
Her phone has been turned off
since yesterday.

240
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:55,100
What is going on?

241
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,100
Hello?

242
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,130
Hey, it's me.

243
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:29,230
What do you want?

244
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:31,300
You threw a tantrum
as if you'd never see me again.

245
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,900
Come on. That day,

246
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:36,470
I got upset
and complained a little...

247
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,280
because the choreography
I poured my heart into was rejected.

248
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:41,980
Let me tell you something
for old time's sake,

249
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,910
so don't take it personally...

250
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,020
and think about it carefully,

251
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,520
Heung Soo.

252
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,890
Okay. Sure.

253
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,190
The world has changed.

254
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:55,060
Times have changed a lot
since the days...

255
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,930
when you and I performed on stage.

256
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:00,460
So what's the point
you're trying to make?

257
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,700
Don't be so obsessed with it...

258
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,270
and make a realistic choice.

259
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,740
So the rest of your life...

260
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,410
won't be so pathetic.

261
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:09,410
Stop it.

262
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:10,540
That's enough.

263
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,910
I will never ask you
to consider my choreography again.

264
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:13,940
I'm hanging up.

265
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,320
What does he know
about choreography to criticize me?

266
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:26,160
Mr. Rooftop House. Are you in there?

267
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:27,890
Yes.

268
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:31,730
Hello.

269
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:33,330
Hey. Well...

270
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,740
When will you be able to move out?

271
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,540
Move?

272
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:43,470
I can move out right away
if you want.

273
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:44,640
Right away?

274
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,280
Yes. The furniture here isn't mine.

275
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,050
I just need to pack my clothes.

276
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:52,120
I will move out in exactly one hour.

277
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:56,020
But you'll need to find
a place to stay.

278
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:58,820
Don't worry about me.
I've already found a place.

279
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:02,990
Can you give me
the deposit right away?

280
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,500
You can't do this.

281
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:09,830
We promised
not to tie each other down.

282
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,640
I'm not tying you down.

283
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,640
As if you're not.
You tied my arms and legs.

284
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,580
Heung Soo.

285
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,260
Are you going on a trip?

286
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,890
It's not like that.

287
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:35,930
I just moved out
of the rooftop house.

288
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,560
What?

289
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,330
Here.

290
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:50,410
What is this?

291
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,110
The money
I borrowed from you before...

292
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:56,080
and the monthly rent
you paid the landlady in advance.

293
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,950
Heung Soo.

294
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:01,420
Thank you for everything.

295
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,250
Are you...

296
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:07,790
trying to run away
before I hold you back?

297
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:11,700
It's not like that.

298
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:17,940
Forget it. I should get going.

299
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:36,320
(K-beauty pioneer G Hair Salon)

300
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,920
Have a nice life without me,
Oh Heung Soo!

301
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:43,330
I have no lingering affection
for you anymore!

302
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,540
- Hey, Ji Ok Bun!
- What?

303
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,640
Don't even call my name, you coward!

304
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,640
You...

305
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,080
Why are you being so reckless?

306
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,510
When you're being so reckless
like a moron,

307
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:02,350
why do I have to stay reasonable?

308
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:04,780
- "Moron?"
- Yes, you moron!

309
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,520
Oh Heung Soo!

310
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:11,490
Don't you dare pass by my store.

311
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,490
I'll kill you if you do!

312
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:15,760
Darn it.

313
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:23,530
She doesn't even know
how I'm feeling.

314
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:25,870
What's wrong with her?

315
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,610
Hello.

316
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:38,320
I'm Lee Yong Dae, the new TA.

317
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:40,320
You must be Dokgo Se Ri.

318
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,620
Yes. I got the call
from the department office.

319
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:45,220
I'll transfer the work to you.

320
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,590
Hey, you guys are here.

321
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,830
Hello, Professor.

322
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,530
Did you two introduce each other?

323
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,430
Yes. I'll learn a lot
from the former TA...

324
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:58,670
and make sure
everything runs smoothly for you.

325
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:04,580
Things have been well
thanks to your thoughtful work.

326
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:05,980
Thank you for everything.

327
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:11,110
Managing the accounting work
according to the regulations,

328
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,880
sending data to the researchers,

329
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,420
and preparing for meetings.

330
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,590
These will be your main tasks,
so make sure to take over the jobs.

331
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,360
I'll do a good job
without making any mistakes...

332
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,860
so you won't have to worry about it.

333
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,060
Okay.

334
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,670
I've organized the main tasks
in each file.

335
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:36,240
If you read it, you'll be able
to understand it easily.

336
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:42,850
You've organized them in detail.

337
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:03,900
Well,

338
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,640
I should get going.

339
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,020
Se Ri.

340
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,290
Dokgo Se Ri.

341
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:29,790
Se Ri, wait.

342
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,560
I'm sorry I hurt your feelings.

343
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:40,000
Is having feelings for you
really such a terrible thing?

344
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,040
Bad enough to get me kicked out...

345
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:45,010
of my TA position?

346
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,620
Don't cry.

347
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,520
All of this is for your sake.

348
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:55,890
For my sake?

349
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:00,290
My heart's in pieces,
and the pain is unbearable.

350
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,190
How could this be for my sake?

351
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,530
This is cruel, Professor.

352
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:56,710
Gyeol.

353
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:59,050
Hey. You made it.

354
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:11,230
Have you been crying?

355
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,600
Why did you cry?

356
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,140
Did something happen?

357
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:23,410
I was just forced out
of my TA position.

358
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,240
What?

359
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:27,210
My mom met with the professor.

360
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:33,550
Don't resent her too much.

361
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:37,520
It's understandable that your mother
would react that way.

362
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,360
I know.

363
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:46,330
All mothers are protective
of their children,

364
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,670
but your mother, in particular,
devoted her life to you.

365
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,370
From how I wear my hair
and the way I dress,

366
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:59,080
to the colleges I applied to
and the friends I spent time with,

367
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:02,310
I did exactly
what my mom told me to do.

368
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:06,880
Even you know
I'm Mommy's little girl.

369
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:12,220
But for the first time ever,

370
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,730
I finally feel like
I'm in control of my own life.

371
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,600
I think I get what you mean.

372
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:30,670
That man you like.

373
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,080
Is he the professor
I saw you with...

374
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,050
when I visited campus on the day
I was discharged...

375
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,320
from the Navy?

376
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:42,790
Yes.

377
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:49,030
I didn't get a good look at him,
but he seemed like a gentleman.

378
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,330
It'll take me a while
to support the two of you,

379
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,870
but I'll at least respect
your feelings.

380
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:03,210
I'm too ashamed
to say anything to you.

381
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,510
I'm really sorry.

382
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:10,880
I've thought about it,

383
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,850
and this isn't something
anyone should feel ashamed of...

384
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:16,920
or apologize for.

385
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:19,890
It was out of your control.

386
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,290
The heart wants what it wants.

387
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:29,870
I haven't told my dad or Bom yet.

388
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,910
I'd like to tell Bom in person.

389
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:37,470
I feel like I should.

390
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:41,910
Sure thing.

because of you,

I'll divorce you, and that's final!

394
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:03,900
Unbelievable.

395
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,040
I can't afford to go through
a divorce at this age.

396
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:10,410
Darn it.

397
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:18,420
Hello?

398
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,850
Right. It's me.

399
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,450
So,

400
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:24,290
have you thought about it?

401
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,560
I'll do as you suggested.

402
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:29,630
As the CEO,
I should take responsibility...

403
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:32,030
for any wrongdoing committed
by my subordinates.

404
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,860
That's how it should be.

405
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:37,230
You made the right decision.

406
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,270
I'll make a public apology
tomorrow afternoon.

407
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:45,740
I'll get my people on it.

408
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:47,980
I appreciate your courage.

409
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,850
This will pull both Silla Brewery...

410
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,550
and Eagle Brewery
out of their holes.

411
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:58,660

Hello?

416
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,330
What took you so long to answer?

417
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,240
Were you busy?

418
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:47,900
What's this about?

419
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:52,380
I called for two reasons.

420
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,980
Two reasons?

421
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,510
First,

422
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,780
how could you ditch me like that
at the bean sprout soup place?

423
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,290
You didn't even pick up the bill.

424
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,320
Goodness.

425
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:09,190
I was so frazzled
that I forgot to pay the bill.

426
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:12,160
You owe me a meal,
and I'm going to hold you to that.

427
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:15,570
Is that the reason you called?

428
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,500
That was the first thing
I needed to tell you.

429
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,300
Now, here's the second.

430
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,270
Could I hear that some other time?

431
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:25,380
How come?

432
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,710
I have to admit, hearing that
you have something to say...

433
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,080
makes me nervous.

434
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,080
Tomorrow afternoon,

435
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:38,350

a public apology.

436
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,560
Really?

437
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:44,030
I was just on the phone
with Chairman Dokgo Tak.

438
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:46,030
Will he really apologize?

439
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,870
I never expected him
to apologize so easily.

440
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:54,340
I told you I'd get him to apologize.

441
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:59,580
I'm not the kind of person
who makes promises I can't keep.

- I...
- Wait.

443
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,680
I can't listen to any more of this.
That's enough. Stop.

444
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:05,620
Stop?

445
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:10,850
I've got a feeling
this might take a weird turn.

446
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:13,190
I'd rather end it here.

447
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:17,860
So you're only going to listen to
what you want to hear?

448
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:20,430
Yes. I'm done listening after this.

449
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,470
Then, I'll hang up first.

450
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:39,980
How can she just pick and choose
what she wants to hear...

451
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,920
and ignore the rest?

452
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:44,290
That's just wrong.

00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:38,010

was revealed to be fake,

Well, I know it's not much,

502
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:56,380
but use it to pay off
some of the bank loan.

503
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:00,950
But we're well aware
of your financial situation.

504

come from?

506
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,930
What?

507
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,330
Where did you get this money?

508
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,240
An idol group selected
my choreography,

509
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,300
and this is the payment I received.

510
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:21,700

Wait. Hold on.

515
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,050
You worked so hard
to earn this money.

516
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:37,520
You shouldn't give it all to us.

517
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:40,490
Come on. If I could,
I'd gladly contribute...

518
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:42,860
not just 20,000 dollars,
but 200,000 or even 2 million.

but I want to do this for you.

532
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:25,130

Sir, I'm sorry to ask,
but could you speed up a little?

535
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:35,810
Sure.

(Operating Room)

545
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:12,320
Excuse me, but may I...

546
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,750
Mi Sun.

547
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,160
Are you Ms. Mun Mi Sun's guardian?

548
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:25,230
- Yes.
- Her hernia...

549
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:27,000
has been repaired.

550
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,870
The surgery was a success
with no complications.

551
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:31,700
I see.

552
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,740
It'll be an hour or two
before she wakes up.

553
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,470
Right. Thank you.

554
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:37,770
We're moving her
to the recovery room now.

555
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:38,770
Sure.

556
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:06,400
I wanted Se Ri to marry Gyeol...

557
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,270
so she'd become
Chairman Han's daughter-in-law,

558
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:11,110
and for Kang Soo to marry Bom...

559
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:13,880
so he could become the son-in-law.

560
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:20,450
If that works out,
I'll have nothing to worry about.

561
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,120
My daughter, you're home.

562
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:34,160
They say you're better off
not having children at all.

563
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,910
What's wrong? Did something happen?

564
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:47,480
Are you really not going
to answer me?

565
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:52,380
You got what you wanted.

566
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,820
Are you happy now?

567
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:56,090
What do you mean
I got what I wanted?

568
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:58,920
I lost my position
as Professor Oh's TA.

569
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:03,760
This only happened
because you went to see him.

570
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:05,460
How come?

571
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:09,100
Did your professor say something
about me?

572
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,130
Mom, please.

573
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:14,470
He's not the type of person
to badmouth others.

574
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:22,680
I get that you're upset,

575
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:25,980
but you'll truly thank me one day...

576
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,480
for shutting this down.

577
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,090
I can guarantee that.

578
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:32,860
I want to be alone, so please leave.

579
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:39,200
Get back to me...

580
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,930
after you have a daughter
just like you.

581
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:44,470
Then, you'll understand
why I did this.

582
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:53,610
But Ha Ni's enough for me.

Come in.

585
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:06,090
Mr. Kim Sa Man is here.

586
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:08,120
Right. Invite him in.

587
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:15,600
Gosh, it's been so long.
How long has it been?

588
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:17,570
The last time we met
was before COVID hit.

589
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:18,570
It's been over five years.

590
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:19,670
Exactly.

591
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:22,370
I was worried when I heard
you had been hospitalized.

592
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:24,110
It's great to see you back
on your feet.

593
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:25,370
Don't even get me started.

594
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:27,710
Back then,
I honestly didn't think I'd make it.

595
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,150
- Let's sit.
- Sure.

596
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:35,920
How's your business doing?

597
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:38,690
With Korean food
becoming more popular,

598
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:40,720
I'm buried in work lately.

599
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:42,660
I already had stores out West,

600
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,460
but now I've expanded...

601
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:47,660
to New York, Washington D.C.,
Atlanta, and even Texas.

602
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,500
I recently opened my 100th store.

603
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,700
I like the sound of that.

604
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:55,710
I've been busy
expanding the supply chain...

605
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:57,570
and only just found time to visit.

606
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:00,940
By the way, your mother-in-law
is one of our regular customers.

607
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:05,250
She's been filling me in
on how you're doing.

608
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:09,190
She's famous among the locals
for her fashion sense.

609
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:11,950
Her English is fluent,
and she could argue for days.

610
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:13,720
She's a force to be reckoned with.

611
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:16,490
I'd expect no less from her.

612
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:19,930
By the way, is liquor...

613
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:22,800
among the products you sell?

614
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,740
Yes, we offer soju
and green plum wine. Why?

615
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:29,640
We've been serving
traditional liquor at the hotel...

616
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,770
to our international guests.

617
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:34,080
It's been receiving rave reviews.

618
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,380
I was wondering
if you'd like to offer it too.

619
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:38,950
A liquor you guarantee?

620
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,050
I'd strongly consider that.

621
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:43,920
It can compete
with any wine out there.

622
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:45,450
Is it that good?

623
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:47,990
Could I meet with the company CEO?

624
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:50,530
I'll be free tomorrow evening.

625
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:52,090
Say no more.

(LX Hotel Chairman Han Dong Seok)

628
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:18,690
Hello?

629
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,060
Could you come
to the hotel right now?

630
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:22,390
Why?

631
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:23,990
There's something to discuss.

632
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:25,530
What is this about?

633
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:28,500
Can't we talk over the phone?

634
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:33,500
I'd like to discuss
a business-related matter.

635
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:36,270
I'll meet you in my office
in an hour.

636
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,010

(Chairman Han Dong Seok)

638
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:50,790
Come in.

639
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:04,130
I'm Eagle Brewery CEO Ma Kwang Sook.

640
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:08,200
I'm here to see
Chairman Han Dong Seok to discuss...

641
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:09,540
a business matter.

642
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:12,910
What on earth are you doing?

643
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:17,180
If you don't mind, I'll sit down.

644
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,270
Shall we start the meeting,
Chairman Han?

645
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:43,240
I get it.

646
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:47,910
You want me to talk business
and nothing else?

647
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:53,580
What did you want to see me about?

648
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,990
I have this childhood friend,

649
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:59,220
and he emigrated young
and settled down.

650
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,090
He owns a chain
of Korean supermarkets in the US.

651
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:05,630
Oh, does he?

652
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:07,900
I met him a short while ago.

653
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:12,870
I suggested he sell
your Jang-Kwang Makgeolli.

654
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:15,040
What?

655
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,870
If things work out,

656
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:20,080
you could export
Jang-Kwang Makgeolli to the US.

657
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,580
Export to the US?

658
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,510
I think the yakju you sold...

659
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:27,580
at the festival we hosted...

660
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:29,550
would do better than your makgeolli.

661
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:31,420
You bet.

662
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:34,660
Our product might be sold in the US?

663
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:35,890
It doesn't feel real.

664
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:38,190
Thank you, Chairman Han.

665
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,030
However,

666
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:45,900
there's something...

667
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:49,070
you should be
much more grateful for.

668
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:54,740
I plucked up the courage
and told you I had feelings for you.

669
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:02,080
Why would you crack
such a scary joke so suddenly?

670
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:05,520
How many times must I say
I'm serious?

671
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:08,820
Do you think I'm the type
who would joke like that?

672
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:18,900
You should learn to accept it
when someone tells the honest truth.

673
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:21,300
Why do you keep twisting it?

674
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:26,140
I'll put it simply for you...

675
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:28,240
by means of an example.

676
00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:34,150
You're like a soccer player
who plays for a premier league team.

677
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:37,320
I play for some random village
on a third-division team.

678
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:40,790
We couldn't be a good match.

679
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,760
Do you like soccer?

680
00:43:44,430 --> 00:43:46,200
I'm glad we have that in common.

681
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:52,570
I'm saying that you and I play
in different leagues.

682
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:55,000
Why would you say
you're on a third-division team?

683
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:57,210
I think you're a premier-league...
I mean,

684
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:59,310
you could play
in the Champions League.

685
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:02,180
You're at it again.

686
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,550
I'll pretend
I didn't hear that and leave.

687
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:08,020
How can you pretend
when you heard everything?

688
00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:11,320
I'm well aware...

689
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:13,890
things don't always go
as you want them to.

690
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:17,360
I also know
the hardest thing to do...

691
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:19,560
is to win someone's heart.

692
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:28,770
I won't rush you.

693
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:32,110
Let's take the time
to get to know each other.

694
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:35,640
Don't shut me out from the start.

695
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,750
Think about it carefully.

696
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:43,020
I should get going. Goodbye.

697
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:46,760
Oh, dear.

698
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:50,130
Will you be more careful?

699
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:54,200
I'm fine. Goodbye.

700
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:55,460
I'm off.

701
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:01,040
Goodness.

702
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:05,770
I'm back.

703
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:10,380
What is it? Do you feel hot?

704
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:13,850
I don't know. I feel flushed.

705
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:16,050
Give me that.

706
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:18,820
Are you menopausal already?

707
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:21,060
You're not old enough for that.

708
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:23,460
That's why you should remarry...

709
00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:26,130
as soon as you can.

710
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:28,630
Give in to the guy...

711
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,730
when someone's willing to have you.

712
00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:34,740
The hotel chairman likes you.

713
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:36,670
Trust me.

714
00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:38,710
I have feelings for you.

715
00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:41,910
This is between us,

716
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:45,380
but why would someone like him
go for someone like you?

717
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:47,720
That's my point exactly.

718
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:51,090
Something's bound to go wrong
if I forget my place and get greedy.

719
00:45:51,690 --> 00:45:53,020
What's wrong with you?

720
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,120
You're the CEO of a brewery.

721
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,830
You're young, pretty,
and well-educated.

722
00:45:57,030 --> 00:45:58,930
What do you lack?

723
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:02,260
Why are you smiling?

724
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:03,570
They say...

725
00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:06,540
blood is thicker than water
and family sticks together,

726
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:09,040
but don't try to set me up
with someone out of my league.

727
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:14,540
You're a human being
with a conscience, okay?

728
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:22,680
Why does she keep talking like that?

729
00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:24,690
Now I feel flushed.

730
00:46:32,330 --> 00:46:34,260
(Hypy Land)

731
00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:42,770
You're so successful.

732
00:46:43,070 --> 00:46:44,810
You went from dancing for Winners...

733
00:46:44,810 --> 00:46:46,070
to a rich businessman.

734
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:47,440
I'm not rich.

735
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,880
Can I stay as long as I want?

736
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:54,350
Yes. Stay until you want to leave.

737
00:46:54,350 --> 00:46:55,480
Okay.

738
00:46:55,950 --> 00:46:58,050
I get to save money
thanks to a rich friend.

739
00:46:58,450 --> 00:47:00,860
Can I have two baked eggs?

740
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,260
We're out of baked eggs.

741
00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:05,630
- Would you like anything else?
- No, thanks.

742
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:11,630
Why do you deal with customers
and not your staff?

743
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:14,970
Someone quit this morning
because of family issues.

744
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,640
I wish I had ten clones.

745
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:18,910
Can I have a cup ramyeon?

746
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:20,640
- Sure.
- Just a moment.

747
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:21,780
I'll get it.

748
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:25,680
(Haega Noodles)

749
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:28,020
That's three dollars.
Scan your locker key.

750
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:30,720
The payment was successful.

751
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,920
If it tastes good,
it's zero calories. Okay?

752
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:35,590
- Enjoy your snack.
- Thanks.

753
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,330
Have you worked at a sauna before?

754
00:47:40,830 --> 00:47:42,060
You bet I have.

755
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,030
There's no part-time job
I haven't done.

756
00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:50,410
Then can you man the snack bar
until I hire someone?

757
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:54,410
Okay. I can do that.

758
00:47:57,180 --> 00:47:59,010
- Here.
- What?

759
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:04,750
I need to take this.

760
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:05,920
Go ahead.

761
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,160
Kang Soo.

762
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,230
Chun Soo just told me...

763
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:13,630
you gave them a huge sum.

764
00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:15,660
You can't call that a huge sum.

765
00:48:16,370 --> 00:48:17,400
I'm almost ashamed.

766
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:20,140
They said you got paid
for selling your choreography.

767
00:48:21,370 --> 00:48:22,400
Yes.

768
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:25,410
That's true. That's what I said.

769
00:48:26,810 --> 00:48:27,840
I'm impressed.

770
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:29,610
Don't flatter me.

771
00:48:30,810 --> 00:48:32,610
I'm an artist.

772
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:34,580
This is nothing.

773
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:36,020
It's just a basic skill of mine.

774
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:48,900
(Taking the world by storm,
Oh Heung Soo, a backup dancer?)

775
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,200
You got duped by Ms. Kim...

776
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:54,640
and almost ruined your life,
and I saved you from her.

777
00:48:56,910 --> 00:48:58,440
I protected you...

778
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:00,780
when the thugs almost killed you.

779
00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:06,950
And you moved out of your place
just to run away from me?

780
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,960
Fine. Good riddance.

781
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:17,590
I'll find a man who loves me...

782
00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:20,430
and date him and get married!

783
00:49:23,470 --> 00:49:24,570
Oh Heung Soo!

784
00:49:24,970 --> 00:49:27,740
Good luck
with the rest of your life!

785
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:49,890
Just a moment, Ha Ni.

786
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:02,100
What's the matter?

787
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:04,970
I'm calling you to say thank you.

788
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:09,140
I heard Se Ri quit
her teaching assistant job.

789
00:50:09,850 --> 00:50:11,980
Thank you for making
such a difficult decision.

790
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:15,480
It's the right thing to do
as a professor for Se Ri.

791
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:18,150
You have no reason to thank me.

792
00:50:19,790 --> 00:50:22,220
Se Ri is having a hard time,

793
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:24,290
but she will get over it soon.

794
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:27,830
I'm sorry for the trouble
we've caused you.

795
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:29,900
If you have nothing else to say,
I'll hang up.

796
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:32,030
And don't call me ever again.

797
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:33,140
It makes me uncomfortable.

798
00:50:37,470 --> 00:50:40,640
Ha Ni, you must be hungry.
Do you want to eat?

799
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:41,910
All right. Let's go.

800
00:50:44,350 --> 00:50:46,080
(Hankuk University Hospital)

801
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:56,320
What?

802
00:50:58,130 --> 00:50:59,730
Chun Soo.

803
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,260
Are you awake?

804
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:03,670
Yes.

805
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,770
What are you doing here?

806
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,710
How did you know I was here?

807
00:51:11,470 --> 00:51:13,710
How could you surprise me like this?

808
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:17,210
I should've known
that you were having surgery.

809
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:19,920
It's nothing serious.

810
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:23,250
It was just a minor hernia surgery.

811
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:25,220
Still, you should've told me.

812
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:27,490
Do you know how shocked I was...

813
00:51:28,690 --> 00:51:30,830
when I heard
you were having surgery?

814
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:34,900
The surgery schedule was set
at the last minute,

815
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:37,500
and I thought...

816
00:51:37,870 --> 00:51:41,500
you'd be worried and bothered
if I told you.

817
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:43,340
Why would you say that?
It's really upsetting.

818
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:45,810
If I had surgery,

819
00:51:46,610 --> 00:51:47,840
would you be bothered?

820
00:51:50,110 --> 00:51:51,110
Chun Soo.

821
00:51:51,110 --> 00:51:52,810
I told you
that if you had a hard time,

822
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:55,550
I'd come running
to you right away...

823
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,590
and give you special treatment.

824
00:52:05,390 --> 00:52:06,430
Why?

825
00:52:07,030 --> 00:52:08,130
Is the pain bad?

826
00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:09,600
Do you want me to call the nurse?

827
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:12,430
No. It's not that.

828
00:52:15,770 --> 00:52:17,870
I'm just grateful...

829
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:20,010
that you said that.

830
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:23,350
What are you so grateful for?

831
00:52:23,850 --> 00:52:24,980
It's something I have to do.

832
00:52:33,090 --> 00:52:34,220
Actually,

833
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:38,090
I was a little scared.

834
00:52:39,630 --> 00:52:42,700
"What if I don't wake up
after the surgery?"

835
00:52:44,270 --> 00:52:46,670
"What if something goes wrong?"

836
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:51,340
"I have no family to look after me,
and I'm all alone."

837
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:55,210
Why are you alone?

838
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:58,080
What about me?

839
00:53:00,350 --> 00:53:01,920
I'm right here next to you.

840
00:53:03,690 --> 00:53:04,920
Why are you alone?

841
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:10,490
Thank you for saying that.

842
00:53:13,090 --> 00:53:15,160
Doesn't your incision hurt?

843
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:16,160
Are you all right?

844
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:19,400
Yes. It's bearable.

845
00:53:23,610 --> 00:53:24,910
By the way, Chun Soo,

846
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:28,980
the thing is,

847
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:33,480
when they gave me the anesthetic
before surgery,

848
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:37,420
your face came to mind.

849
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:41,090
I wondered if I'd ever...

850
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:44,430
wake up and see your face again.

851
00:53:51,430 --> 00:53:52,430
Darn it.

852
00:53:53,270 --> 00:53:55,800
I wanted to finish the surgery
without anyone knowing.

853
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,710
I dreamed of a perfect crime.

854
00:53:58,570 --> 00:53:59,640
But I failed.

855
00:54:01,910 --> 00:54:02,910
What?

856
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,330
(Lynx Golf Wear VIP Styling Class)

857
00:54:32,110 --> 00:54:34,480
Hello, Lieutenant Oh.

858
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:35,980
It's been a while.

859
00:54:36,650 --> 00:54:38,280
Congratulations on your new job.

860
00:54:38,910 --> 00:54:41,250
Bom told me
she'd be working with you.

861
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:42,650
She sounded so happy.

862
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:45,150
Are you here to meet Bom?

863
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:46,490
Yes.

864
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:47,860
She's in there.

865
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:48,990
Go in.

866
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:56,430
Has the model for the makeover
arrived yet?

867
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:59,070
No. I've been calling her,
but she's not answering.

868
00:54:59,970 --> 00:55:01,370
It's almost time.

869
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:03,640
What if she doesn't show up?

870
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:07,740
Bom.

871
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:09,480
Hey, you're early.

872
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:12,710
Yes. I was waiting at the cafe,
but I was bored.

873
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:16,950
You must be Bom's friend.

874
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:19,150
Can I ask you a favor?

875
00:55:51,950 --> 00:55:53,020
Hello.

876
00:55:53,020 --> 00:55:55,320
I'm Han Bom, who will be hosting...

877
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:56,660
this styling class event.

878
00:55:57,390 --> 00:56:01,000
Now, let's start the styling class.

879
00:56:12,270 --> 00:56:14,310
Our 2025 SS collection captures...

880
00:56:14,310 --> 00:56:17,850
the beauty and elegance of a journey
on the golf course.

881
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:20,920
With their unique patterns
and functional materials,

882
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:23,120
these pieces are perfect not only
for performance golf wear,

883
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:26,550
but also for everyday
and resort wear.

884
00:56:32,230 --> 00:56:33,260
The one on the left...

885
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:36,060
is a performance style suitable
for a couple's round of golf,

886
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:37,700
so it's neat and comfortable.

887
00:56:38,070 --> 00:56:39,430
The right one...

888
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:41,740
is perfect for everyday wear.

889
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:44,170
Among those who are
attending the event today,

890
00:56:44,170 --> 00:56:47,240
I'd like to pick one
and give her a makeover.

891
00:56:49,010 --> 00:56:52,080
Could you come up to the stage
for a moment?

892
00:57:05,890 --> 00:57:08,630
You look great in the outfit.

893
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:11,400
It's a bright outfit
that gives off the spring vibe.

894
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:13,200
She looks stylish already,

895
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:14,240
but how about this?

896
00:57:18,370 --> 00:57:20,980
With a purse
that spices up your fashion,

897
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:26,550
you can complete
a much more sophisticated style.

898
00:57:39,630 --> 00:57:42,160
It seems like Bom hosted the show...

899
00:57:42,430 --> 00:57:44,670
a lot more smoothly
than we expected.

900
00:57:44,730 --> 00:57:46,730
I think so. I was impressed.

901
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:50,270
Apparently, Silla Brewery will be
holding a press conference soon.

902
00:57:51,470 --> 00:57:54,040
As soon as the press conference
is over,

903
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:57,650
we should hand out press releases...

904
00:57:57,650 --> 00:57:59,610
stating that our hotel
will continue...

905
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:02,380
to collaborate closely
with Eagle Brewery...

906
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:06,020
to help advance the quality
and culture of traditional liquor.

907
00:58:26,410 --> 00:58:28,880
I'm Chairman Dokgo Tak
of Silla Brewery.

908
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:31,080
First of all,

909
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:34,050
I would like to deeply apologize...

910
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:38,450
for the unfortunate incident
involving our company.

911
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:41,090
Although...

912
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:45,460
the incident occurred
due to the personal greed...

913
00:58:45,830 --> 00:58:47,700
of a member of our company,

914
00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:50,970
I feel ashamed...

915
00:58:50,970 --> 00:58:54,370
that our Silla Brewery,
which has been loved by the public,

916
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,700
has failed to live up...

917
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:58,140
to people's expectations.

918
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:02,840
In addition,
I would like to express...

919
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:05,310
my deepest apologies
to Eagle Brewery...

920
00:59:05,950 --> 00:59:08,950
that suffered greatly
due to this incident.

921
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:18,090
That jerk, who's like Kim Jong Un,
is trying to get away with this.

922
00:59:19,130 --> 00:59:21,830
He looks like a sneaky trickster.

923
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:25,800
Just wait and see.

924
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:28,900
I'll lay bare the truth
and make him...

925
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:31,670
rub his hands together
and beg us for forgiveness.

926
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:35,180
You made him apologize
by doing the one-man protest.

927
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:37,110
You did a great job.

928
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:44,020
I'll get him to apologize to you,

929
00:59:44,090 --> 00:59:45,190
so please stop this.

930
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:47,320
What man would like...

931
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:50,290
someone he cares about
being stared at?

932
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:00,230
Are you feeling hot?

933
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:04,410
Well... I suddenly got a hot flash
out of nowhere.

934
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,750
You should be on your way
to that meeting.

935
01:00:12,810 --> 01:00:13,820
- Goodness.
- Right.

936
01:00:14,220 --> 01:00:15,650
Look at the time.

937
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:18,220
This is the business proposal
for the convenience store.

938
01:00:18,220 --> 01:00:19,720
I just changed the title.

939
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:22,160
You can use that as a reference
when speaking with the buyer.

940
01:00:23,590 --> 01:00:24,990
Thanks, Mr. Vice-CEO.

941
01:00:25,430 --> 01:00:27,700
Kim, have you sealed the bottles
of Jang-Kwang Yakju?

942
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:29,200
- Yes.
- Can you box them...

943
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:30,400
and have them gift-wrapped?

944
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:33,370
I'll head home
and quickly get changed.

945
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:36,440
- I'll see you in a bit.
- Sure.

946
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:44,080
No way.

947
01:00:45,610 --> 01:00:47,350
Kwang Sook, my gosh.

948
01:00:48,550 --> 01:00:50,080
Your look screams CEO.

949
01:00:51,790 --> 01:00:52,790
Thanks.

950
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:54,920
Don't be nervous and stay relaxed.

951
01:00:56,460 --> 01:00:58,160
- I'll do a good job.
- Sure. Let's go.

952
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:08,700
Hello, CEO Ma.

953
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,040
What...

954
01:01:10,740 --> 01:01:12,240
What brings you here?

955
01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:15,380
The chairman sent me
to escort you to the hotel.

956
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:17,480
What?

957
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:36,100
Actually, let me.

958
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:42,870
My goodness.

959
01:01:44,210 --> 01:01:46,110
Welcome. I've been waiting for you.

960
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:50,950
Why were you waiting for me?
That just makes me uncomfortable.

961
01:01:51,610 --> 01:01:53,010
You should step out of the car now.

962
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:55,120
Sure.

963
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:11,100
Of all the times I've seen you,

964
01:02:11,630 --> 01:02:13,370
you look the most beautiful today.

965
01:02:17,470 --> 01:02:19,410
Why would you say that to me?

966
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:21,040
It's a compliment.

967
01:02:21,710 --> 01:02:24,080
Please don't compliment me
like that.

968
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:25,210
You're making me feel uncomfortable.

969
01:02:29,180 --> 01:02:31,320
I can't say harsh things
when you look that good.

970
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:38,990
I'd prefer
you said harsh things instead.

971
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:36,020
(For Eagle Brothers)

972
01:03:36,220 --> 01:03:38,620
Let me borrow your brewery manager
for a day.

973
01:03:38,650 --> 01:03:41,020
I want to take him
to Golden Castle today.

974
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:43,760
I doubt Mr. Go would agree
to go there.

975
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:45,190
I don't think I can do this.

976
01:03:45,190 --> 01:03:46,790
No way. Absolutely not.

977
01:03:46,790 --> 01:03:47,860
It's about Heung Soo.

978
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:49,900
- He's been staying at a sauna.
- There you are.

979
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,130
- What?
- Are you the owner of this sauna?

980
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:55,140
Meet me outside the brewery.
I'm waiting for you.

981
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:57,440
If you're cooking ramyeon,
make an extra portion.

982
01:03:57,610 --> 01:03:59,340
I'd like to have some.

983
01:03:59,570 --> 01:04:00,740
That must be my mom.

984
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:01,880
Hold on.

985
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:04,480
Why should I hide
when I've done nothing wrong?
