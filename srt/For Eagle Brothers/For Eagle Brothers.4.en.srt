00:00:02,609 --> 00:00:04,478
(Episode 4)

2
00:00:10,314 --> 00:00:11,385
It feels so refreshing.

3
00:00:12,454 --> 00:00:14,725
Who made this bean sprout soup?

4
00:00:16,254 --> 00:00:17,324
Yes, it's him.

5
00:00:17,864 --> 00:00:18,925
I knew it.

6
00:00:19,594 --> 00:00:20,765
You're the best.

7
00:00:22,995 --> 00:00:25,364
I noticed the pot was half empty.

8
00:00:26,004 --> 00:00:27,364
Did you drink it all?

9
00:00:30,535 --> 00:00:32,775
That was the undiluted liquor, you know.

10
00:00:32,775 --> 00:00:34,044
And you drank it all?

11
00:00:34,675 --> 00:00:37,514
As I told you before, I know how to hold my liquor.

12
00:00:38,915 --> 00:00:40,144
- My gosh. - But still...

13
00:00:40,144 --> 00:00:43,285
How could you drink it all?

14
00:00:43,584 --> 00:00:46,184
By the way, this is really interesting.

15
00:00:46,385 --> 00:00:48,324
I drank a lot of alcohol,

16
00:00:48,654 --> 00:00:50,294
but I don't feel sick at all.

17
00:00:51,995 --> 00:00:55,465
I must say Jang Soo's makgeolli is the best.

18
00:00:57,165 --> 00:01:00,005
Ms. Gong called us many times this morning.

19
00:01:00,404 --> 00:01:02,734
It seems like she waited for you...

20
00:01:03,374 --> 00:01:05,074
all night.

21
00:01:11,585 --> 00:01:12,615
What?

22
00:01:12,684 --> 00:01:14,115
- Why... - Oh, gosh.

23
00:01:14,855 --> 00:01:15,915
What...

24
00:01:19,624 --> 00:01:20,725
My goodness.

25
00:01:21,525 --> 00:01:23,094
This is truly unique.

26
00:01:23,725 --> 00:01:25,165
I have no idea what'll happen next.

27
00:01:27,365 --> 00:01:28,434
Oh, dear.

28
00:01:38,005 --> 00:01:40,645
Kwang Sook, can we come in?

29
00:01:40,805 --> 00:01:41,874
Yes.

30
00:01:42,915 --> 00:01:44,074
Come in.

31
00:01:49,085 --> 00:01:51,424
Why? Is something wrong?

32
00:01:51,984 --> 00:01:53,255
Nothing's wrong.

33
00:01:54,025 --> 00:01:56,324
I have to leave for an appointment now.

34
00:01:57,294 --> 00:01:58,965
I should go and pick up Ha Ni.

35
00:01:59,695 --> 00:02:01,165
I have a class to teach in the morning.

36
00:02:01,594 --> 00:02:04,164
My leave is until today, so I should go back to Jinhae.

37
00:02:05,164 --> 00:02:07,974
Don't worry about me. Go and do what you have to do.

38
00:02:08,675 --> 00:02:11,705
I'll lie down for a while and go when I feel better.

39
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:14,615
Do you need some hangover pills?

40
00:02:15,545 --> 00:02:16,715
I'm fine.

41
00:02:17,045 --> 00:02:19,284
I'll eat some bean sprout soup later.

42
00:02:31,154 --> 00:02:34,835
Jang Soo thought of you as his son.

43
00:02:37,664 --> 00:02:40,365
Stay healthy while serving in the military.

44
00:02:41,805 --> 00:02:43,805
Take good care of yourself too.

45
00:02:50,115 --> 00:02:51,745
You promised to send me...

46
00:02:51,745 --> 00:02:54,485
a concert ticket of the idols whom you choreographed for.

47
00:02:55,184 --> 00:02:56,314
You shouldn't forget that.

48
00:02:57,615 --> 00:02:59,654
Of course not. I'll get you the VIP seat.

49
00:03:03,354 --> 00:03:05,265
- It's Ha Ni, right? - Yes.

50
00:03:05,925 --> 00:03:07,564
Please let me see her sometime.

51
00:03:08,465 --> 00:03:09,564
I'm curious.

52
00:03:09,895 --> 00:03:11,034
I will.

53
00:03:12,934 --> 00:03:14,835
I'm sure you will get back on your feet.

54
00:03:16,305 --> 00:03:17,434
Hang in there.

55
00:03:17,434 --> 00:03:18,575
Thank you.

56
00:03:19,045 --> 00:03:20,575
You should pull yourself together.

57
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,545
If you need my help or advice,

58
00:03:23,374 --> 00:03:24,745
call me anytime.

59
00:03:25,585 --> 00:03:26,615
Okay.

60
00:03:27,414 --> 00:03:28,455
I will.

61
00:03:29,715 --> 00:03:30,814
This is it...

62
00:03:31,555 --> 00:03:33,654
for my farewells.

63
00:03:39,664 --> 00:03:40,694
Attention.

64
00:03:43,495 --> 00:03:45,465
Salute your sister-in-law!

65
00:03:45,765 --> 00:03:47,064
- Victory! - Victory!

66
00:04:01,314 --> 00:04:02,754
Victory.

67
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:11,625
Mr. Go.

68
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:12,724
(Eagle Brewery)

69
00:04:12,724 --> 00:04:16,034
So what are you going to do with Eagle Brewery?

70
00:04:16,994 --> 00:04:19,265
We will meet a lawyer and talk about it in the afternoon.

71
00:04:19,505 --> 00:04:20,935
I guess we will have to liquidate it.

72
00:04:23,234 --> 00:04:24,304
I'm sorry.

73
00:04:25,544 --> 00:04:27,044
Thank you for your hard work.

74
00:04:27,304 --> 00:04:28,645
You don't need to apologize.

75
00:04:28,974 --> 00:04:30,815
I'm sick and tired of makgeolli now.

76
00:04:31,945 --> 00:04:34,955
I'll go back to my hometown and live comfortably as a farmer.

77
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,784
Jang Soo cherished it like his life.

78
00:04:40,385 --> 00:04:41,525
This feels horrible.

79
00:04:45,594 --> 00:04:47,094
Is there no other way?

80
00:04:49,395 --> 00:04:53,635
(Eagle Brewery)

81
00:04:58,744 --> 00:05:00,974
Why are you all puffy?

82
00:05:01,914 --> 00:05:03,015
Are you sick?

83
00:05:06,085 --> 00:05:07,185
Promise me one thing.

84
00:05:09,554 --> 00:05:11,414
That you won't do anything to harm Eagle Brewery.

85
00:05:12,984 --> 00:05:14,554
What nonsense are you talking about in the morning?

86
00:05:14,554 --> 00:05:16,424
It's you who said nonsense last night.

87
00:05:16,695 --> 00:05:18,465
You said you'd take over Eagle Brewery.

88
00:05:18,765 --> 00:05:20,965
Why is it nonsense? It only makes sense.

89
00:05:20,965 --> 00:05:22,034
Honey!

90
00:05:22,435 --> 00:05:23,994
I don't know what makes you...

91
00:05:24,534 --> 00:05:27,705
so hung up on that darn family like that,

92
00:05:29,135 --> 00:05:30,604
but I'm not like you.

93
00:05:31,034 --> 00:05:33,244
Just hearing the name of that place...

94
00:05:33,244 --> 00:05:35,645
makes me feel bad all day long.

95
00:05:35,645 --> 00:05:37,614
That's because we did something bad.

96
00:05:37,744 --> 00:05:38,784
What?

97
00:05:39,114 --> 00:05:42,255
It's true that both you and I have done terrible things.

98
00:05:42,315 --> 00:05:43,854
Who says it's a terrible thing?

99
00:05:43,914 --> 00:05:45,255
I sacrificed my whole youth.

100
00:05:45,255 --> 00:05:46,755
That was the least compensation I had to receive.

101
00:05:46,755 --> 00:05:47,784
Forget it.

102
00:05:48,825 --> 00:05:50,424
Just leave Eagle Brewery alone.

103
00:05:51,424 --> 00:05:52,794
If you don't do as I say,

104
00:05:53,594 --> 00:05:55,435
I'll divorce you right away.

105
00:05:59,304 --> 00:06:00,364
How ridiculous.

106
00:06:01,005 --> 00:06:03,275
Whose side is she on anyway?

107
00:06:08,775 --> 00:06:11,275
My goodness.

108
00:06:13,185 --> 00:06:14,645
Yes. Come in.

109
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,125
How is your back?

110
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:27,395
I guess I'll have to suffer for a few days.

111
00:06:29,794 --> 00:06:31,294
This is the doorman uniform.

112
00:06:32,304 --> 00:06:34,534
You didn't forget about the shoot, did you?

113
00:06:34,864 --> 00:06:35,904
Oh, dear.

114
00:06:36,534 --> 00:06:39,974
I have a backache now. Can we put it off a few days?

115
00:06:40,744 --> 00:06:43,515
Everything is all set already, and the staff are on standby now.

116
00:06:44,075 --> 00:06:45,685
I don't think we can put it off.

117
00:06:45,815 --> 00:06:48,654
Why did I hurt my back at a time like this?

118
00:06:51,154 --> 00:06:52,185
- My goodness. - Here.

119
00:06:56,154 --> 00:06:58,195
We have made a name tag especially for you.

120
00:07:01,164 --> 00:07:02,695
If you have a hard time during the shoot,

121
00:07:02,695 --> 00:07:04,234
please let me know right away.

122
00:07:04,234 --> 00:07:05,765
I'll take you to the hospital.

123
00:07:20,445 --> 00:07:21,445
Yes?

124
00:07:22,585 --> 00:07:23,885
Where are you now?

125
00:07:24,114 --> 00:07:27,054
Where do you think? I'm home.

126
00:07:28,494 --> 00:07:30,494
Why are you still there?

127
00:07:30,654 --> 00:07:34,065
You were supposed to pack your stuff and come to my place last night.

128
00:07:35,465 --> 00:07:37,164
I was going to, but I wanted...

129
00:07:38,465 --> 00:07:41,565
to have a farewell drink before leaving,

130
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,604
and I ended up drinking too much.

131
00:07:45,005 --> 00:07:46,744
Did you drink with your brothers-in-law?

132
00:07:47,145 --> 00:07:48,275
No.

133
00:07:48,614 --> 00:07:49,674
I drank alone.

134
00:07:50,645 --> 00:07:52,484
What a lunatic you are!

135
00:07:53,715 --> 00:07:55,154
You startled me.

136
00:07:56,054 --> 00:07:57,455
It made me sober up.

137
00:07:59,585 --> 00:08:01,625
I can't believe I was happy after giving birth to you.

138
00:08:01,955 --> 00:08:04,525
Pack your stuff and come right away.

139
00:08:05,794 --> 00:08:07,195
I'll go...

140
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:09,695
when I sober up and feel better.

141
00:08:10,534 --> 00:08:12,304
Don't worry about me.

142
00:08:14,935 --> 00:08:17,474
Hey, Ma Kwang Sook. You fool.

143
00:08:19,005 --> 00:08:21,715
Gosh, that silly thing.

144
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:24,515
Why would she idle away her time there?

145
00:08:33,425 --> 00:08:36,124
Hello? Gong Ju Sil speaking.

146
00:08:38,155 --> 00:08:39,224
Now?

147
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:42,264
(Group Signatures)

148
00:08:43,994 --> 00:08:45,104
What is this?

149
00:08:45,104 --> 00:08:47,835
It's a petition that asks...

150
00:08:48,575 --> 00:08:51,435
to force you out of Golden Castle.

151
00:08:51,435 --> 00:08:53,045
I can't believe this.

152
00:08:53,244 --> 00:08:55,915
Why are you forcing me out when I did nothing wrong?

153
00:08:57,344 --> 00:08:58,984
In Golden Castle,

154
00:08:59,545 --> 00:09:02,285
there are three things that you are not supposed to do.

155
00:09:02,455 --> 00:09:05,484
Acting rich, acting smart, and acting snobbish.

156
00:09:06,055 --> 00:09:07,085
My goodness.

157
00:09:07,085 --> 00:09:10,155
I've never acted rich, smart, or snobbish.

158
00:09:10,325 --> 00:09:11,825
I'm just pretty and smart.

159
00:09:12,065 --> 00:09:14,065
But you made a mistake...

160
00:09:14,065 --> 00:09:16,134
that is worse than those three things.

161
00:09:17,295 --> 00:09:18,364
What is it?

162
00:09:18,465 --> 00:09:19,935
Fraternism.

163
00:09:20,104 --> 00:09:23,374
You clearly established a private relationship...

164
00:09:23,474 --> 00:09:26,374
with married male residents.

165
00:09:26,474 --> 00:09:28,815
You're being ridiculous.

166
00:09:29,075 --> 00:09:30,774
All I did was play golf...

167
00:09:30,774 --> 00:09:32,685
and eat with them a few times.

168
00:09:32,685 --> 00:09:35,014
I swear to deities up there...

169
00:09:35,155 --> 00:09:36,555
that I've never done anything bad.

170
00:09:36,555 --> 00:09:39,185
We are taking care of it this way since this is your first time.

171
00:09:39,524 --> 00:09:42,024
But if the same thing happens again,

172
00:09:42,024 --> 00:09:43,455
we won't be able to help.

173
00:09:43,455 --> 00:09:46,695
If there's a dispute or conflict between the residents,

174
00:09:46,695 --> 00:09:49,594
we have no choice but to remove...

175
00:09:50,364 --> 00:09:51,494
the source of the problem.

176
00:09:51,565 --> 00:09:54,004
What kind of nonsense is this?

177
00:09:54,165 --> 00:09:57,104
I was told this was the best retirement home.

178
00:09:57,104 --> 00:10:00,075
But you're blaming an innocent person.

179
00:10:32,474 --> 00:10:34,144
It smells of Jang Soo.

180
00:10:50,295 --> 00:10:51,894
It's as if...

181
00:10:52,965 --> 00:10:54,665
Jang Soo's hugging me.

182
00:11:05,035 --> 00:11:06,104
Hello?

183
00:11:06,474 --> 00:11:08,274
This is Manager Ha.

184
00:11:08,274 --> 00:11:11,175
I'm calling about the dress that needs repairing.

185
00:11:11,474 --> 00:11:13,785
Oh, right. The 2,000 dollars...

186
00:11:17,715 --> 00:11:19,325
This is where you'll be.

187
00:11:22,224 --> 00:11:25,364
My goodness. I heard you hurt your back, sir.

188
00:11:25,364 --> 00:11:27,425
I'm not feeling my best today,

189
00:11:27,425 --> 00:11:29,195
so let's take it easy.

190
00:11:29,195 --> 00:11:30,535
As long as I get enough footage for the broadcast,

191
00:11:30,535 --> 00:11:31,665
I won't ask for more.

192
00:11:32,405 --> 00:11:35,205
Because you're so stylish,

193
00:11:35,205 --> 00:11:37,734
you still look great in the doorman uniform.

194
00:11:38,575 --> 00:11:40,805
We'll film you from inside...

195
00:11:40,805 --> 00:11:42,415
that tent over there.

196
00:11:42,415 --> 00:11:45,244
Try to relax and act as naturally as possible.

197
00:11:45,644 --> 00:11:46,844
Okay.

198
00:11:47,344 --> 00:11:50,014
All right then. Let's begin the shoot!

199
00:11:52,984 --> 00:11:54,685
Slate. One, two.

200
00:11:58,724 --> 00:12:01,165
Hey, Mom. How do you feel?

201
00:12:01,465 --> 00:12:02,594
Did you have breakfast?

202
00:12:04,494 --> 00:12:05,504
Yes.

203
00:12:06,634 --> 00:12:08,134
I'm having it right now.

204
00:12:09,004 --> 00:12:10,835
My sweet daughter.

205
00:12:11,705 --> 00:12:13,644
Were you worried about me?

206
00:12:13,844 --> 00:12:15,205
I noticed this morning...

207
00:12:15,205 --> 00:12:17,244
that your eyes were red and puffy.

208
00:12:17,744 --> 00:12:18,945
You didn't cry, did you?

209
00:12:19,085 --> 00:12:20,715
Why would I cry?

210
00:12:21,484 --> 00:12:24,085
I didn't sleep well and I'm tired. That's all.

211
00:12:24,884 --> 00:12:26,055
Are you sure that's it?

212
00:12:26,285 --> 00:12:29,695
You're the only one who cares about me.

213
00:12:30,494 --> 00:12:31,695
You are...

214
00:12:31,965 --> 00:12:33,624
all I have, Se Ri.

215
00:12:34,165 --> 00:12:36,264
You're my whole life.

216
00:12:36,634 --> 00:12:40,165
Say that one more time and it'll be the millionth time.

217
00:12:42,134 --> 00:12:43,175
Okay.

218
00:12:43,175 --> 00:12:45,004
I'll call you when I'm there.

219
00:12:46,104 --> 00:12:47,104
Bye.

220
00:12:49,675 --> 00:12:51,175
Is your mother unwell?

221
00:12:51,175 --> 00:12:52,915
I guess she's not feeling great.

222
00:12:55,045 --> 00:12:57,555
Is something bothering you, Bom?

223
00:12:57,754 --> 00:12:58,754
What?

224
00:12:58,754 --> 00:13:01,455
You suddenly wanted to visit Gyeol.

225
00:13:01,455 --> 00:13:03,854
I'm wondering if something's wrong.

226
00:13:04,494 --> 00:13:05,724
Nothing's wrong.

227
00:13:06,795 --> 00:13:08,935
I want to see my brother and get some fresh air...

228
00:13:08,935 --> 00:13:10,465
before the new semester.

229
00:13:12,604 --> 00:13:14,805
You seemed a bit downcast...

230
00:13:14,805 --> 00:13:17,035
these past few days, and I was worried.

231
00:13:18,435 --> 00:13:20,445
Are you sure there's nothing wrong?

232
00:13:21,104 --> 00:13:22,215
Yes.

233
00:13:23,545 --> 00:13:24,715
I promise.

234
00:13:24,715 --> 00:13:26,114
- You do? - Yes.

235
00:13:26,144 --> 00:13:27,244
Okay, then.

236
00:13:29,815 --> 00:13:31,955
(Youngjun Express)

237
00:13:31,955 --> 00:13:34,785
(Seoul, Jinhae)

238
00:13:44,234 --> 00:13:45,504
Hello.

239
00:13:47,004 --> 00:13:49,205
Did you send off your brother well?

240
00:13:49,705 --> 00:13:51,705
Yes, I did, thanks to you.

241
00:13:52,705 --> 00:13:53,744
Was she lots of trouble?

242
00:13:53,744 --> 00:13:55,545
Not at all.

243
00:13:59,085 --> 00:14:01,484
Ha Ni, did you have fun with Grandma?

244
00:14:03,085 --> 00:14:05,285
Something came up that I must tell you about.

245
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:20,764
Hi, Beom Soo.

246
00:14:20,864 --> 00:14:22,935
Hi, Chun Soo. Are you free this afternoon?

247
00:14:23,234 --> 00:14:24,874
I'm meeting the lawyer,

248
00:14:24,874 --> 00:14:27,504
but Ha Ni's sitter needed to travel urgently.

249
00:14:28,045 --> 00:14:29,215
Oh, dear.

250
00:14:29,974 --> 00:14:31,474
I finally got a job interview,

251
00:14:31,474 --> 00:14:32,585
and I'm busy.

252
00:14:34,085 --> 00:14:35,315
Why not call Heung Soo?

253
00:14:36,014 --> 00:14:37,085
Today?

254
00:14:38,254 --> 00:14:39,524
I'm teaching today.

255
00:14:40,085 --> 00:14:41,925
Move the meeting to tomorrow.

256
00:14:41,925 --> 00:14:43,055
I'm free tomorrow.

257
00:14:43,795 --> 00:14:46,864
Okay. Let's talk again later.

258
00:14:54,604 --> 00:14:56,604
Welcome.

259
00:15:07,244 --> 00:15:08,715
Heung Soo.

260
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,185
Hello.

261
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:11,984
My gosh.

262
00:15:12,785 --> 00:15:13,984
Mr. Oh.

263
00:15:15,994 --> 00:15:17,925
What brought you here?

264
00:15:18,425 --> 00:15:19,624
Take this.

265
00:15:21,364 --> 00:15:23,864
What is this?

266
00:15:23,864 --> 00:15:26,364
I was surprised to see how much was in the envelope.

267
00:15:27,264 --> 00:15:29,134
You'd just joined my class,

268
00:15:29,134 --> 00:15:31,004
yet you showed great kindness.

269
00:15:32,445 --> 00:15:34,144
Thank you anyway.

270
00:15:38,514 --> 00:15:41,244
You're so polite.

271
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:43,614
No. It's only right that I thank you.

272
00:15:43,614 --> 00:15:45,754
I'll see you in class later.

273
00:15:48,325 --> 00:15:50,494
Wait.

274
00:15:56,695 --> 00:15:58,094
Since you're here,

275
00:15:58,465 --> 00:16:00,004
let me treat your hair.

276
00:16:00,004 --> 00:16:01,504
It's on me.

277
00:16:03,104 --> 00:16:05,205
Thanks for the offer, but I'm out of sorts today,

278
00:16:05,205 --> 00:16:06,504
and I must prepare for class.

279
00:16:06,504 --> 00:16:08,915
I'll come by again when I'm free.

280
00:16:12,445 --> 00:16:14,884
You must be tired after such an event.

281
00:16:15,614 --> 00:16:19,524
I'll pressure-massage your scalp so that you feel energized.

282
00:16:20,224 --> 00:16:21,325
Okay?

283
00:16:34,565 --> 00:16:35,604
What are you doing?

284
00:16:37,335 --> 00:16:39,604
I was checking to see if you needed a shave.

285
00:16:40,274 --> 00:16:42,315
I had my facial hair waxed off.

286
00:16:43,945 --> 00:16:44,974
Okay.

287
00:16:44,974 --> 00:16:47,445
Then it's just the scalp massage.

288
00:16:48,984 --> 00:16:50,785
(G Hair Salon)

289
00:16:54,455 --> 00:16:56,195
Don't put in too much effort.

290
00:16:56,195 --> 00:16:58,394
I've done this for 20 years,

291
00:16:58,394 --> 00:17:00,865
and I always do my best.

292
00:17:01,595 --> 00:17:03,595
I'll offer you my best service.

293
00:17:04,165 --> 00:17:05,195
Okay.

294
00:17:15,145 --> 00:17:17,244
You can skip the face.

295
00:17:18,984 --> 00:17:21,715
Just leave it to me.

296
00:17:21,715 --> 00:17:24,215
I know exactly what to do.

297
00:17:26,284 --> 00:17:28,855
Is there a lot left to do?

298
00:17:29,925 --> 00:17:32,724
I'm just getting started.

299
00:17:43,574 --> 00:17:44,875
Can you stop...

00:17:48,274 --> 00:17:49,445
(CEO Dokgo Tak)

301
00:17:50,615 --> 00:17:52,685
How much were they paid in advance?

302
00:17:52,685 --> 00:17:55,445
I managed to identify seven companies involved so far.

303
00:17:56,254 --> 00:17:57,254
I don't know exactly,

304
00:17:57,254 --> 00:17:59,484
but it should be at least 500,000 dollars.

305
00:17:59,484 --> 00:18:00,984
Did everything go as planned?

306
00:18:01,155 --> 00:18:04,625
I dropped a rumor that the banks will soon try...

307
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,425
to recover the loans.

308
00:18:06,895 --> 00:18:08,024
Good.

309
00:18:09,395 --> 00:18:11,764
They'll end up as secondary creditors and lose...

310
00:18:11,764 --> 00:18:14,334
what they paid if they don't take action.

311
00:18:14,804 --> 00:18:17,034
There's no way the wholesalers won't do anything.

312
00:18:17,135 --> 00:18:18,774
That's right.

313
00:18:18,774 --> 00:18:20,044
If one makes a move,

314
00:18:20,044 --> 00:18:22,675
the others will follow suit.

315
00:18:22,744 --> 00:18:24,544
Stay on top of things and fill me in.

316
00:18:25,244 --> 00:18:27,484
Also, prepare the acquisition proposal...

317
00:18:27,484 --> 00:18:29,415
to give to Eagle Brewery.

318
00:18:30,284 --> 00:18:31,314
Yes, sir.

319
00:18:31,314 --> 00:18:35,024
Since we're offering to take over their debt to the banks,

320
00:18:35,024 --> 00:18:38,024
make sure their asset valuation is kept as low as possible.

321
00:18:38,794 --> 00:18:40,665
Yes, sir. I understand.

322
00:19:11,294 --> 00:19:15,524
(Fermenting Room)

323
00:19:48,564 --> 00:19:49,764
Where to, ma'am?

324
00:19:49,995 --> 00:19:52,264
LX Hotel, sir.

325
00:19:55,534 --> 00:19:57,135
Where do I need to go to find him?

326
00:19:57,774 --> 00:19:59,074
Hand that flash drive over.

327
00:19:59,074 --> 00:20:00,344
I'll check the footage and contact you.

328
00:20:00,344 --> 00:20:02,044
As if I could trust you.

329
00:20:02,044 --> 00:20:04,145
- What? - How can I trust...

330
00:20:04,145 --> 00:20:05,985
that you'd actually call me?

331
00:20:06,844 --> 00:20:08,584
Ma'am, please fasten your seat belt.

332
00:20:09,415 --> 00:20:10,614
Right.

333
00:20:14,155 --> 00:20:16,195
I should've gotten his contact information.

334
00:20:17,094 --> 00:20:18,155
Darn.

335
00:20:22,334 --> 00:20:23,764
Thank you, sir.

336
00:20:25,635 --> 00:20:26,764
Welcome.

337
00:20:28,834 --> 00:20:29,935

(Eagle Brewery)

339
00:20:31,235 --> 00:20:32,675
Is this where you work?

340
00:20:33,304 --> 00:20:35,104
I was worried for no reason.

341
00:20:35,274 --> 00:20:36,344
You remember me, right?

342
00:20:37,745 --> 00:20:38,784
The gimbap lady?

343
00:20:39,145 --> 00:20:40,185
Yes, that's me.

344
00:20:40,185 --> 00:20:42,985
I was hoping to resume our conversation from before.

345
00:20:43,155 --> 00:20:44,814
Don't you feign ignorance again.

346
00:20:44,814 --> 00:20:47,084
I'm on the clock, so we'll talk later.

347
00:20:47,084 --> 00:20:48,695
(Eagle Brewery)

348
00:20:50,324 --> 00:20:52,324
I get that you're working,

349
00:20:52,465 --> 00:20:54,965
but I'm a busy person myself.

350
00:20:55,695 --> 00:20:57,094
I get what you mean,

351
00:20:57,094 --> 00:20:59,264
so we'll talk about it after hours.

352
00:20:59,405 --> 00:21:02,935
Are you telling me to wait until you're off the clock, mister?

353
00:21:03,135 --> 00:21:04,804
Again with that "mister" nonsense.

354
00:21:05,574 --> 00:21:07,745
Stop calling me that...

355
00:21:08,104 --> 00:21:11,215
and wait quietly if you want your payment.

356
00:21:12,215 --> 00:21:14,584
Why do you sound like you're doing me a favor...

357
00:21:14,584 --> 00:21:16,084
when you're the one at fault?

358
00:21:16,084 --> 00:21:18,114
You must be confused about this,

359
00:21:18,114 --> 00:21:20,284
but you're the offender...

360
00:21:20,385 --> 00:21:21,784
who tore my wedding dress...

361
00:21:21,784 --> 00:21:23,294
while I'm the victim.

362
00:21:23,294 --> 00:21:24,324
What the...

363
00:21:24,794 --> 00:21:25,824
Darn.

364
00:21:26,794 --> 00:21:29,264
I'm the one who's suffering immensely...

365
00:21:29,264 --> 00:21:31,594
from the damage you caused to my back.

366
00:21:31,935 --> 00:21:33,834
Hold on. What does your sore back...

367
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:36,405
have to do with me that you're blaming me for it?

368
00:21:36,534 --> 00:21:38,074
The steps at the columbarium.

369
00:21:38,844 --> 00:21:40,044
Does it ring a bell?

370
00:21:41,874 --> 00:21:43,445
The steps at the columbarium?

371
00:21:51,885 --> 00:21:53,024
Welcome.

372
00:22:10,534 --> 00:22:11,574
Goodness.

373
00:22:11,804 --> 00:22:13,804
Sir, should I step in?

374
00:22:14,344 --> 00:22:15,344
It's fine.

375
00:22:15,745 --> 00:22:16,774
My gosh.

376
00:22:21,915 --> 00:22:25,014
(Eagle Brewery)

377
00:22:25,955 --> 00:22:29,094
Yesterday, you almost tripped on the steps...

378
00:22:29,195 --> 00:22:31,124
of the columbarium,

379
00:22:31,124 --> 00:22:34,294
and I threw out my back while holding onto you.

380
00:22:36,735 --> 00:22:38,804
Whatever. Enough with the side story.

381
00:22:39,064 --> 00:22:41,205
You should take responsibility...

382
00:22:41,205 --> 00:22:43,005
for ripping someone else's dress.

383
00:22:50,745 --> 00:22:52,584
I'm busy with work at the moment,

384
00:22:52,885 --> 00:22:55,554
so have a cup of coffee on me by flashing this card.

385
00:22:55,554 --> 00:22:56,784
I'll come to see you once I'm done.

386
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:58,114
Take it.

387
00:22:59,524 --> 00:23:00,524
Hold on.

388
00:23:01,925 --> 00:23:04,425
Are you making a move on me?

389
00:23:06,195 --> 00:23:07,524
Just so you know,

390
00:23:07,524 --> 00:23:10,195
I have no intention of grabbing coffee with you.

391
00:23:14,165 --> 00:23:16,905
I see you're busy with your day job,

392
00:23:16,975 --> 00:23:18,505
so I'll leave for today.

393
00:23:19,205 --> 00:23:22,344
This won't fly though when I come to see you tomorrow.

394
00:23:23,374 --> 00:23:26,645
Mr. Han Dong Seok.

395
00:23:26,645 --> 00:23:29,415
Fine. We'll settle this later on.

396
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:32,824
I'll come by again tomorrow at this exact time.

397
00:23:33,225 --> 00:23:35,024
If you feign ignorance again,

398
00:23:35,024 --> 00:23:38,024
I'll report everything to the owner of this hotel.

399
00:23:39,064 --> 00:23:40,264
The choice is yours.

400
00:23:46,064 --> 00:23:48,604
Fine, do whatever you want.

401
00:23:53,774 --> 00:23:54,844
Welcome.

402
00:24:16,635 --> 00:24:18,165
The steps at the columbarium?

403
00:24:30,145 --> 00:24:31,145
(The late Oh Jang Soo)

404
00:24:36,385 --> 00:24:37,685
What...

405
00:24:38,114 --> 00:24:39,185
Are you all right?

406
00:24:42,725 --> 00:24:43,854
That guy...

407
00:24:44,225 --> 00:24:45,395
was that mister?

408
00:24:47,094 --> 00:24:48,764
- Welcome. - Hi.

409
00:24:49,695 --> 00:24:51,995
Can I get some pain relief patches?

410
00:24:51,995 --> 00:24:54,205
- It's for a tweaked back. - Oh, dear.

411
00:24:56,175 --> 00:24:57,635
You did great, sir.

412
00:24:58,374 --> 00:25:01,905
This was harder than expected.

413
00:25:02,145 --> 00:25:04,374
I was worried about you being injured,

414
00:25:04,374 --> 00:25:06,614
but it looked amazing on camera.

415
00:25:06,745 --> 00:25:09,685
By the way, who was that lady you were talking to earlier?

416
00:25:09,955 --> 00:25:11,985
She mentioned a wedding dress.

417
00:25:12,284 --> 00:25:13,725
Oh, her? My gosh.

418
00:25:13,725 --> 00:25:16,854
Please edit all of it out.

419
00:25:16,995 --> 00:25:17,995
Sorry?

420
00:25:22,264 --> 00:25:25,635
Can you check for security cameras pointing at the steps...

421
00:25:25,935 --> 00:25:27,834
at Bom's mother's columbarium?

422
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:29,405
Security cameras?

423
00:25:29,405 --> 00:25:32,205
If there's any footage, secure the recordings...

424
00:25:32,344 --> 00:25:33,804
from the time of my visit yesterday.

425
00:25:33,945 --> 00:25:36,074
Yes, sir. I'll get right on it.

426
00:25:36,574 --> 00:25:37,745
Wait up!

427
00:25:39,314 --> 00:25:40,915
Not her again.

428
00:25:45,925 --> 00:25:47,024
What is it this time?

429
00:25:47,824 --> 00:25:50,624
I thought about it hard while waiting for the bus...

430
00:25:51,124 --> 00:25:54,324
but still couldn't tell for sure if it was you who helped me...

431
00:25:54,624 --> 00:25:55,965
on the steps.

432
00:25:55,965 --> 00:25:57,665
We agreed to talk tomorrow,

433
00:25:58,665 --> 00:26:01,405
so why did you rush impatiently back here again?

434
00:26:02,574 --> 00:26:05,005
Do I seem like someone who'd skip out...

435
00:26:05,005 --> 00:26:06,874
on a minor payment like that?

436
00:26:08,074 --> 00:26:11,715
Why are you biting my head off without hearing me out?

437
00:26:11,814 --> 00:26:12,844
Look here.

438
00:26:14,715 --> 00:26:16,114
Since I was on the clock...

439
00:26:16,514 --> 00:26:19,225
and suffering from an injury, I asked...

440
00:26:19,225 --> 00:26:21,824
if we could pick this up tomorrow.

441
00:26:22,255 --> 00:26:25,324
But here you are being impossible the second I got off the clock.

442
00:26:25,725 --> 00:26:27,094
That's not it.

443
00:26:27,094 --> 00:26:28,425
Does life seem like a joke to you?

444
00:26:29,435 --> 00:26:30,665
Do you think you'll get your way...

445
00:26:30,665 --> 00:26:32,165
by being impossible and throwing a fit?

446
00:26:32,505 --> 00:26:33,534
Look here.

447
00:26:33,534 --> 00:26:35,135
Do you always make a fuss...

448
00:26:35,534 --> 00:26:37,235
when money's involved?

449
00:26:37,235 --> 00:26:39,175
That's no way to talk to someone.

450
00:26:42,145 --> 00:26:45,114
It looks like you just got married.

451
00:26:46,215 --> 00:26:47,645
Your husband...

452
00:26:48,584 --> 00:26:49,814
must be exhausted.

453
00:26:50,715 --> 00:26:52,485
No one can live out their life in full...

454
00:26:52,554 --> 00:26:54,124
by being harassed like this.

455
00:27:03,764 --> 00:27:04,794
Well,

456
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:07,264
what I mean is that...

457
00:27:12,334 --> 00:27:15,005
What I just said was cruel. I apologize.

458
00:27:20,245 --> 00:27:22,215
- Hey. - Sir.

459
00:27:23,514 --> 00:27:25,255
She must've wanted to give you some pain relief patches.

460
00:27:26,784 --> 00:27:27,985
(Eagle Brewery)

461
00:27:36,435 --> 00:27:37,695
Is he implying...

462
00:27:38,534 --> 00:27:40,735
that I'm the reason something happened to Jang Soo?

463
00:27:46,945 --> 00:27:48,205
What a jerk.

464
00:27:53,215 --> 00:27:56,354
(Job interviews)

465
00:28:06,094 --> 00:28:07,264
(Missed call: Kim Sang Cheol)

466
00:28:13,205 --> 00:28:14,264
Hey, Mr. Kim.

467
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:16,205
I just wrapped up my job interview.

468
00:28:16,874 --> 00:28:18,175
How was it?

469
00:28:18,975 --> 00:28:21,104
Things were amicable since you put in a good word for me.

470
00:28:22,245 --> 00:28:23,814
The interview went well,

471
00:28:25,985 --> 00:28:28,245
but they asked me about that fund as expected.

472
00:28:28,284 --> 00:28:31,114
Of course. It was a huge scandal in our line of work.

473
00:28:32,354 --> 00:28:33,524
Still, I'm grateful.

474
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:37,695
My heart is pounding from being in the field again.

475
00:28:39,794 --> 00:28:41,195
We'll grab a meal soon.

476
00:28:41,425 --> 00:28:42,935
Right. Sure thing.

477
00:28:43,135 --> 00:28:44,695
Have a good one.

478
00:28:54,604 --> 00:28:56,044
Jang Soo was the one...

479
00:28:56,614 --> 00:28:58,675
who was the proudest to see me in uniform.

480
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:03,114
I might not be able to be your proud brother anymore.

481
00:29:04,885 --> 00:29:05,985
I'm sorry, Jang Soo.

482
00:29:21,834 --> 00:29:23,574
Thank you for driving all the way.

483
00:29:24,604 --> 00:29:26,445
Look, it's the sea.

484
00:29:27,645 --> 00:29:29,245
Is Gyeol still at work?

485
00:29:30,074 --> 00:29:31,114
Well...

486
00:29:31,114 --> 00:29:32,784
Let's have some coffee...

487
00:29:32,784 --> 00:29:35,084
and enjoy the beach for a while before moving.

488
00:29:35,284 --> 00:29:37,485
Okay. I'll go to the restroom.

489
00:29:37,614 --> 00:29:38,614
All right.

490
00:29:46,024 --> 00:29:47,024
Bom.

491
00:29:49,294 --> 00:29:51,495
My goodness. What are you doing here?

492
00:29:52,834 --> 00:29:55,205
Have you been tailing me?

493
00:29:56,235 --> 00:29:58,104
I wanted to talk to you,

494
00:29:58,104 --> 00:29:59,675
so I went to your place.

495
00:29:59,675 --> 00:30:01,475
That's when I saw your car leave, so I followed it.

496
00:30:02,475 --> 00:30:04,175
I have nothing to say to you.

497
00:30:05,014 --> 00:30:06,814
You promised not to do this again.

498
00:30:06,814 --> 00:30:08,084
Why are you being like this?

499
00:30:08,084 --> 00:30:09,715
I still have things to say to you.

500
00:30:10,354 --> 00:30:11,715
Even if we break up,

501
00:30:11,715 --> 00:30:12,824
I want to clear up the misunderstandings.

502
00:30:12,824 --> 00:30:14,985
I've already told you several times. There was no misunderstanding.

503
00:30:15,485 --> 00:30:17,024
I think I made myself clear.

504
00:30:17,024 --> 00:30:18,495
I don't want to go out with you.

505
00:30:19,794 --> 00:30:20,895
Is that all that matters?

506
00:30:21,965 --> 00:30:24,034
How many times do I have to tell you that I want to go out with you?

507
00:30:24,034 --> 00:30:25,534
Why do you ignore my feelings?

508
00:30:27,604 --> 00:30:29,804
- I'm not done talking. - What are you doing?

509
00:30:30,304 --> 00:30:31,435
If you keep being like this,

510
00:30:32,235 --> 00:30:33,445
I'll scream.

511
00:30:37,245 --> 00:30:38,975
- Go ahead and scream. - Please.

512
00:30:38,975 --> 00:30:41,185
I feel so miserable that I can't even sleep...

513
00:30:41,185 --> 00:30:42,344
or eat.

514
00:30:42,814 --> 00:30:44,854
I couldn't focus on my work, so I applied for a leave of absence.

515
00:30:46,554 --> 00:30:49,054
My life is a mess because of you.

516
00:30:49,054 --> 00:30:50,624
Who do you think you are?

517
00:30:50,925 --> 00:30:53,195
Why are you making me so miserable?

518
00:30:55,564 --> 00:30:56,864
You don't need to be afraid.

519
00:30:56,864 --> 00:30:58,534
I just want you to hear me out.

520
00:30:58,965 --> 00:31:00,665
- Let's talk in the car. - No.

521
00:31:00,665 --> 00:31:02,165
- Come with me. - I don't want to.

522
00:31:02,165 --> 00:31:05,034
Come here. Let's talk in the car.

523
00:31:06,245 --> 00:31:07,574
Just come with me.

524
00:31:08,104 --> 00:31:09,774
Okay? It will be fine.

525
00:31:11,614 --> 00:31:13,814
Are you all right? Are you not hurt?

526
00:31:20,354 --> 00:31:21,784
Who the heck are you?

527
00:31:27,864 --> 00:31:29,195
Darn it.

528
00:31:29,495 --> 00:31:32,435
Hey, don't interrupt me.

529
00:31:33,935 --> 00:31:35,005
Let go!

530
00:31:39,975 --> 00:31:41,245
Let go of me!

531
00:31:41,245 --> 00:31:42,405
Are you okay?

532
00:31:42,945 --> 00:31:44,774
I'm sorry. It's because of me.

533
00:31:44,774 --> 00:31:46,885
It's no big deal. Stay back.

534
00:31:47,344 --> 00:31:48,385
Bom!

535
00:31:48,645 --> 00:31:49,755
Se Ri.

536
00:31:51,354 --> 00:31:52,554
What happened?

537
00:31:53,185 --> 00:31:54,455
Let go!

538
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,624
Are you all right?

539
00:31:55,624 --> 00:31:57,455
Let go! Darn it.

540
00:32:03,935 --> 00:32:05,294
- Gyeol. - Gyeol.

541
00:32:05,294 --> 00:32:06,965
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

542
00:32:07,665 --> 00:32:09,774
I'm okay, except for the bruises.

543
00:32:11,874 --> 00:32:14,274
It happened while I was in the restroom.

544
00:32:16,005 --> 00:32:17,145
I'm sorry.

545
00:32:17,145 --> 00:32:18,245
What are you saying?

546
00:32:19,274 --> 00:32:20,485
You must've been shocked.

547
00:32:21,715 --> 00:32:23,514
My heart almost popped out of my chest.

548
00:32:24,755 --> 00:32:26,885
If it weren't for this officer,

549
00:32:26,885 --> 00:32:28,455
she would've been in big trouble.

550
00:32:29,524 --> 00:32:30,554
It's fine now.

551
00:32:33,294 --> 00:32:34,524
Oh Kang Soo?

552
00:32:36,294 --> 00:32:37,834
Do you know him?

553
00:32:39,564 --> 00:32:40,804
He's in the Navy.

554
00:32:41,405 --> 00:32:42,564
And he's my patient.

555
00:32:42,905 --> 00:32:43,935
I see.

556
00:32:47,774 --> 00:32:48,774
What...

557
00:32:50,074 --> 00:32:51,245
No, stay lying down.

558
00:32:51,675 --> 00:32:53,784
What are you doing here, Mr. Han?

559
00:32:55,715 --> 00:32:57,185
The girl you saved...

560
00:32:58,054 --> 00:32:59,215
is my sister.

561
00:32:59,284 --> 00:33:00,354
What?

562
00:33:05,524 --> 00:33:08,765
One, two. One, two, three, four.

563
00:33:08,765 --> 00:33:10,294
Jump.

564
00:33:10,294 --> 00:33:11,794
Stretch.

565
00:33:11,794 --> 00:33:13,365
Jump.

566
00:33:13,365 --> 00:33:14,664
Stretch.

567
00:33:14,664 --> 00:33:16,274
Jump.

568
00:33:16,274 --> 00:33:18,704
Stretch. Shake. All right.

569
00:33:18,704 --> 00:33:19,744
Turn.

570
00:33:20,204 --> 00:33:22,345
Shake. Turn.

571
00:33:22,845 --> 00:33:25,515
- Mr. Oh! - Hello. You're here.

572
00:33:25,515 --> 00:33:27,684
- It was really fun today. - My gosh.

573
00:33:27,684 --> 00:33:29,314
You were really good today.

574
00:33:29,314 --> 00:33:31,854
- It was amazing. - My goodness.

575
00:33:32,215 --> 00:33:34,224
- It was great. - Right.

576
00:33:34,224 --> 00:33:35,524
How can you be so good?

577
00:33:35,524 --> 00:33:37,294
- Have a seat here. - Thank you.

578
00:33:37,524 --> 00:33:38,854
They will probably sign up again.

579
00:33:40,965 --> 00:33:42,024
All right.

580
00:33:45,494 --> 00:33:47,334
I like the smell of your shampoo.

581
00:33:49,704 --> 00:33:50,704
Okay.

582
00:33:51,874 --> 00:33:54,774
Let me buy you coffee today.

583
00:33:54,774 --> 00:33:56,274
Thank you for attending the funeral despite your busy schedule.

584
00:33:56,845 --> 00:33:59,374
I was deeply moved by your sincerity.

585
00:34:01,015 --> 00:34:03,485
It's us who were truly moved, Mr. Oh.

586
00:34:03,954 --> 00:34:05,885
You're experiencing unimaginable grief,

587
00:34:05,885 --> 00:34:07,325
but you showed no sign of it.

588
00:34:07,325 --> 00:34:09,524
You just had the class you always did.

589
00:34:09,755 --> 00:34:12,155
I must say you're a professional.

590
00:34:12,155 --> 00:34:13,394
Tell me about it.

591
00:34:13,865 --> 00:34:16,865
Your late brother must be proud of you.

592
00:34:18,035 --> 00:34:19,905
I got scolded a lot...

593
00:34:19,905 --> 00:34:21,535
for dancing instead of studying,

594
00:34:21,535 --> 00:34:22,834
and I made him worry a lot.

595
00:34:23,934 --> 00:34:25,274
I have a lot of regrets.

596
00:34:26,744 --> 00:34:29,244
Mr. Oh, you should show your brother...

597
00:34:29,244 --> 00:34:31,575
how you meet a good woman, start a family,

598
00:34:31,575 --> 00:34:34,385
and live happily having children.

599
00:34:34,515 --> 00:34:37,155
Ms. Ji, didn't you say you'd set him up with someone?

600
00:34:37,155 --> 00:34:38,354
My gosh. Really?

601
00:34:39,414 --> 00:34:41,084
Did I? When did I say that?

602
00:34:41,084 --> 00:34:43,454
You said that while I was getting a perm.

603
00:34:43,454 --> 00:34:47,064
Why do you keep insisting I said things that I didn't say?

604
00:34:47,494 --> 00:34:49,224
I didn't say anything like that!

605
00:34:49,224 --> 00:34:51,465
Goodness me. It's fine even if you didn't.

606
00:34:51,465 --> 00:34:53,305
Why are you yelling?

607
00:34:55,305 --> 00:34:57,175
You don't have to find someone who's far away.

608
00:34:57,175 --> 00:34:58,735
Among your students,

609
00:34:58,735 --> 00:35:00,474
there are singles who are financially well-off,

610
00:35:00,474 --> 00:35:02,604
capable, and have good looks.

611
00:35:02,604 --> 00:35:04,814
She's right. They say you can't see right under your nose.

612
00:35:04,814 --> 00:35:06,515
It doesn't have to be someone far away.

613
00:35:06,515 --> 00:35:09,044
You should find someone who's already close to you.

614
00:35:09,115 --> 00:35:10,115
Who?

615
00:35:10,615 --> 00:35:12,115
Now that we've brought it up,

616
00:35:12,314 --> 00:35:14,485
what do you think of Ms. Kim?

617
00:35:17,524 --> 00:35:18,524
Ms. Kim?

618
00:35:18,524 --> 00:35:21,124
She's good-looking and warmhearted.

619
00:35:21,124 --> 00:35:23,035
And she runs her piano academy well.

620
00:35:23,035 --> 00:35:24,965
Oh, right. Come to think of it,

621
00:35:24,965 --> 00:35:28,564
you two kind of look alike.

622
00:35:28,564 --> 00:35:29,874
- What? - What?

623
00:35:29,874 --> 00:35:31,974
- Look at her. - My gosh. You're right.

624
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:34,175
Marry her!

625
00:35:34,175 --> 00:35:36,515
- Marry her! - Marry her!

626
00:35:36,515 --> 00:35:38,914
- Marry her! - Marry her!

627
00:35:38,914 --> 00:35:41,044
- Marry her! - Marry her!

628
00:35:41,044 --> 00:35:43,584
- Marry her! - Marry her!

629
00:35:43,584 --> 00:35:44,684
Isn't he nice?

630
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:48,524
- My goodness. Please stop it. - She's perfect for you.

631
00:35:48,524 --> 00:35:50,854
- Marry her! - Marry her!

632
00:35:50,854 --> 00:35:52,494
- Hey, you... - Marry her!

633
00:35:54,494 --> 00:35:56,024
Isn't this nice?

634
00:35:56,024 --> 00:35:57,135
Gosh, no.

635
00:35:57,135 --> 00:35:58,365
- Have a son and a daughter. - My gosh.

636
00:35:58,365 --> 00:36:01,735
- Please stop it. - They all are talking nonsense.

637
00:36:03,675 --> 00:36:04,774
You all should sign up again.

638
00:36:04,774 --> 00:36:06,075
Don't betray us.

639
00:36:06,075 --> 00:36:07,075
Sign up again, okay?

640
00:36:07,075 --> 00:36:08,405
I should give you a discount.

641
00:36:08,405 --> 00:36:09,615
- Mr. Oh. - Yes.

642
00:36:09,615 --> 00:36:11,115
The bread is good here.

643
00:36:11,115 --> 00:36:12,274
You're on a diet, aren't you?

644
00:36:17,785 --> 00:36:19,825
Did you want to see me?

645
00:36:24,325 --> 00:36:25,394
What's the matter?

646
00:36:26,595 --> 00:36:28,195
I won't beat around the bush...

647
00:36:28,195 --> 00:36:29,664
and will cut to the chase.

648
00:36:29,664 --> 00:36:32,664
I'd like you to quit coming to the Zumba class.

649
00:36:33,604 --> 00:36:34,664
Pardon?

650
00:36:35,905 --> 00:36:37,575
I'm asking you sincerely.

651
00:36:38,805 --> 00:36:41,445
Don't come to the community center starting tomorrow.

652
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:43,615
Why not?

653
00:36:45,974 --> 00:36:48,515
This is a little embarrassing.

654
00:36:49,184 --> 00:36:51,954
Since it has come to this, I'll just be honest with you.

655
00:36:53,825 --> 00:36:57,655
I called dibs on Mr. Oh.

656
00:36:58,325 --> 00:37:00,965
Don't even try to make a move on him.

657
00:37:01,724 --> 00:37:04,494
My goodness. I can't believe this.

658
00:37:05,735 --> 00:37:08,064
I'm asking you with all my heart.

659
00:37:09,505 --> 00:37:10,974
Find another community center.

660
00:37:10,974 --> 00:37:13,405
You're not asking me a favor. It sounds like a threat.

661
00:37:14,575 --> 00:37:17,075
Don't be so perverse.

662
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:20,785
Gosh.

663
00:37:25,485 --> 00:37:28,724
Here. This is a gift certificate for ten clinic sessions.

664
00:37:28,985 --> 00:37:31,755
It's worth 1,000 dollars.

665
00:37:35,825 --> 00:37:37,965
Please do me a favor, okay?

666
00:37:46,505 --> 00:37:49,575
(Eagle Brewery)

00:37:49,575 --> 00:37:50,644

(Eagle Brewery)

670
00:37:54,985 --> 00:37:56,115
My goodness.

671
00:37:56,615 --> 00:37:58,055
You must be Ha Ni.

672
00:37:58,715 --> 00:38:01,354
It's so nice to see you. I'm your aunt.

673
00:38:01,954 --> 00:38:04,724
By the way, are you still here?

674
00:38:05,994 --> 00:38:08,024
Don't rush me.

675
00:38:08,024 --> 00:38:09,664
I'll leave when I'm ready to leave.

676
00:38:12,064 --> 00:38:15,704
By the way, aren't you supposed to meet the lawyer today?

677
00:38:17,635 --> 00:38:19,635
I guess he's here.

678
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:26,414
I'll look after Ha Ni. You should go and talk to him.

679
00:38:26,885 --> 00:38:28,744
- What? - Go ahead and give her to me.

680
00:38:28,744 --> 00:38:29,954
No, it's okay.

681
00:38:29,954 --> 00:38:32,515
Come on. I'm telling you.

682
00:38:33,385 --> 00:38:35,454
Please have some tea while you talk.

683
00:38:35,454 --> 00:38:36,755
Thank you.

684
00:38:37,055 --> 00:38:38,925
- Here. - Thank you.

685
00:38:42,524 --> 00:38:43,765
Are you not considering...

686
00:38:44,135 --> 00:38:46,834
running the brewery yourself?

687
00:38:49,604 --> 00:38:51,934
No. I don't think I can do that.

688
00:38:51,974 --> 00:38:53,505
As you may know,

689
00:38:53,505 --> 00:38:55,445
it has more liabilities than assets.

690
00:38:56,305 --> 00:39:00,845
In this case, it would be wise to renounce the inheritance...

691
00:39:00,845 --> 00:39:02,285
or apply for the benefit of inventory.

692
00:39:03,854 --> 00:39:06,954
That's the only option, right?

693
00:39:08,155 --> 00:39:09,155
Yes.

(Chairman Han Dong Seok)

695
00:39:25,334 --> 00:39:26,575
Come in.

696
00:39:32,474 --> 00:39:34,084
I got back from the columbarium.

697
00:39:34,744 --> 00:39:37,115
There are no security cameras by the stairs.

698
00:39:38,115 --> 00:39:39,925
It can't be helped. Good job.

699
00:39:40,684 --> 00:39:43,224
Sir, about the woman from earlier...

700
00:39:43,854 --> 00:39:46,394
I found out she was recently widowed.

701
00:39:48,064 --> 00:39:49,794
Her husband's dead?

702
00:39:51,635 --> 00:39:55,505
They got married at our hotel not long ago.

703
00:39:55,805 --> 00:39:58,235
Yes. I feel so sorry for her.

704
00:40:00,104 --> 00:40:03,075
It looks like you just got married.

705
00:40:03,575 --> 00:40:05,274
Your husband...

706
00:40:05,544 --> 00:40:06,885
must be exhausted.

707
00:40:07,914 --> 00:40:09,644
No one can live out their life in full...

708
00:40:09,644 --> 00:40:11,255
by being harassed like this.

709
00:40:20,994 --> 00:40:23,164
I made a dreadful mistake.

710
00:40:25,494 --> 00:40:26,735
It's the worst.

711
00:40:28,834 --> 00:40:29,874
My gosh.

712
00:40:39,046 --> 00:40:40,885
Think about it a bit longer.

713
00:40:41,316 --> 00:40:43,555
Your brother put his life into this brewery.

714
00:40:43,825 --> 00:40:47,325
It makes no sense to give it up so easily.

715
00:40:47,655 --> 00:40:49,426
Do you think I feel good about it?

716
00:40:50,526 --> 00:40:52,196
But there's nothing else we can do.

717
00:41:01,276 --> 00:41:02,606
- This is the place. - My gosh.

718
00:41:02,606 --> 00:41:03,975
- They're here. - Yes.

719
00:41:03,975 --> 00:41:05,506
- You too? - Here they are.

720
00:41:05,506 --> 00:41:07,015
What brings you here?

721
00:41:07,015 --> 00:41:09,115
You're the owner's wife and brother.

722
00:41:09,416 --> 00:41:11,685
I saw you at the funeral hall, right?

723
00:41:11,885 --> 00:41:14,055
That's us. Why are you all here?

724
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:15,955
Is it true the brewery...

725
00:41:15,955 --> 00:41:18,526
will be shut down so you can pay back the banks?

726
00:41:19,426 --> 00:41:20,626
It must be true.

727
00:41:21,055 --> 00:41:23,225
You should pay the small business owners first.

728
00:41:23,225 --> 00:41:25,365
You can't pay the banks first!

729
00:41:25,426 --> 00:41:28,466
I can't believe you think this little of us wholesalers.

730
00:41:28,466 --> 00:41:30,435
- Isn't that right? - That's right!

731
00:41:30,435 --> 00:41:32,106
- Pay us first! - You owe us!

732
00:41:33,106 --> 00:41:34,975
If you were unable to pay it back,

733
00:41:35,135 --> 00:41:37,676
shouldn't you have refused the advance pay?

734
00:41:38,046 --> 00:41:41,075
Taking money you're incapable of returning.

735
00:41:41,276 --> 00:41:43,316
That's called fraud. Your brother duped us.

736
00:41:43,316 --> 00:41:45,885
What do you mean he duped you? You're being harsh.

737
00:41:45,885 --> 00:41:48,385
How is that harsh when it's no small amount?

738
00:41:48,685 --> 00:41:49,986
I might lose the money...

739
00:41:49,986 --> 00:41:52,486
I need to pay my workers and feed my family.

740
00:41:52,796 --> 00:41:53,825
That's fraud!

741
00:41:53,825 --> 00:41:55,626
- Yes. - That's fraud!

742
00:41:55,626 --> 00:41:57,325
- What will you do? - What about this?

743
00:41:57,325 --> 00:41:59,225
- Pay me back! - What are your plans?

744
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:00,495
It's just money!

745
00:42:00,995 --> 00:42:02,265
I'll give it to you.

746
00:42:03,506 --> 00:42:04,666
How much is it?

747
00:42:04,805 --> 00:42:06,635
- She'll pay us? - What?

748
00:42:07,606 --> 00:42:09,575
Don't you know what Oh Jang Soo was like?

749
00:42:09,975 --> 00:42:12,276
He wouldn't have taken a cent he couldn't repay.

750
00:42:13,176 --> 00:42:15,046
Did you do business with him not knowing that?

751
00:42:16,646 --> 00:42:18,245
How much does he owe you...

752
00:42:18,245 --> 00:42:20,916
that you're making him out to be a scammer?

753
00:42:21,316 --> 00:42:23,856
I'll pay you back. Isn't that what you want?

754
00:42:24,385 --> 00:42:25,455
Kwang Sook.

755
00:42:25,885 --> 00:42:27,756
You can't say something like that so frivolously.

756
00:42:28,926 --> 00:42:30,325
Don't stop me, Beom Soo.

757
00:42:30,696 --> 00:42:32,426
Even if I end up homeless,

758
00:42:32,426 --> 00:42:34,466
I won't let anyone call Jang Soo a scammer.

759
00:42:35,896 --> 00:42:38,106
Let's see your papers.

760
00:42:38,865 --> 00:42:40,676
I know Jang Soo's handwriting.

761
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:42,606
If any of you lied,

762
00:42:42,606 --> 00:42:45,876
be well aware I'll send you to prison for forgery.

763
00:42:47,845 --> 00:42:49,046
Keep your word.

764
00:42:49,615 --> 00:42:50,946
It'd be great if you could repay the money.

765
00:42:52,385 --> 00:42:53,555
Please, Kwang Sook.

766
00:43:03,526 --> 00:43:06,236
Your husband came home from work,

767
00:43:06,466 --> 00:43:08,196
and you won't even greet him?

768
00:43:11,905 --> 00:43:13,075
Are you drunk?

769
00:43:13,635 --> 00:43:15,075
I warned you.

770
00:43:16,546 --> 00:43:18,205
I said I'd divorce you...

771
00:43:18,205 --> 00:43:19,816
if you tried to take Eagle Brewery.

772
00:43:22,245 --> 00:43:24,486
If you cared that much about them,

773
00:43:24,515 --> 00:43:26,086
why did you embezzle?

774
00:43:28,115 --> 00:43:30,385
You made me take the money.

775
00:43:35,055 --> 00:43:36,365
Listen carefully.

776
00:43:37,666 --> 00:43:39,696
When we stole from Eagle Brewery...

777
00:43:39,696 --> 00:43:41,966
and disappeared during the night 30 years ago,

778
00:43:42,396 --> 00:43:44,666
the person who gave me the ledger,

779
00:43:44,666 --> 00:43:46,805
bank records, and seals was Ms. Jang.

780
00:43:48,405 --> 00:43:49,805
It was you.

781
00:43:51,245 --> 00:43:53,716
So quit acting so elegant...

782
00:43:53,716 --> 00:43:55,975
and pretending you care about Eagle Brewery...

783
00:43:55,975 --> 00:43:58,185
just because you live a cushy life now.

784
00:43:58,916 --> 00:44:00,155
It's hypocritical.

785
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:02,185
What?

786
00:44:03,086 --> 00:44:05,325
Quit sulking and cook. I'm hungry.

787
00:44:24,276 --> 00:44:25,705
Chun Soo.

788
00:44:25,805 --> 00:44:27,245
Step back. I'll do this.

789
00:44:30,816 --> 00:44:31,845
But...

790
00:44:36,526 --> 00:44:39,426
You reduced half the volume. Thanks.

791
00:44:46,365 --> 00:44:47,365
My gosh.

792
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:52,265
Running a convenience store must be tough. How is it?

793
00:44:52,635 --> 00:44:54,606
It's better than staying at home.

794
00:44:55,405 --> 00:44:58,575
I get to see people and hear how things are going.

795
00:44:58,905 --> 00:44:59,975
It's fun.

796
00:45:01,046 --> 00:45:02,046
That's good to hear.

797
00:45:02,515 --> 00:45:03,785
Did you just get off work?

798
00:45:04,515 --> 00:45:05,515
What?

799
00:45:06,015 --> 00:45:09,486
Yes. I came by to discuss something with my brothers.

800
00:45:11,126 --> 00:45:13,595
What will happen to the brewery?

801
00:45:15,055 --> 00:45:16,396
I think we need to close it down.

802
00:45:18,566 --> 00:45:21,166
Jang Soo sacrificed a lot to keep it going,

803
00:45:21,635 --> 00:45:23,705
but there's no one left who can make liquor,

804
00:45:23,805 --> 00:45:25,205
and it's struggling financially too.

805
00:45:26,975 --> 00:45:28,035
It doesn't look good.

806
00:45:28,705 --> 00:45:29,845
What a shame.

807
00:45:30,305 --> 00:45:33,546
The whole neighborhood was proud we had Eagle Makgeolli.

808
00:45:37,885 --> 00:45:38,946
Do you remember?

809
00:45:39,955 --> 00:45:41,955
Jang Soo invited the whole class...

810
00:45:41,955 --> 00:45:44,486
to the brewery after the college entrance exam...

811
00:45:44,555 --> 00:45:46,285
and threw a makgeolli party.

812
00:45:46,495 --> 00:45:47,526
He did.

813
00:45:48,856 --> 00:45:51,725
That was the first time I'd ever had makgeolli.

814
00:45:52,066 --> 00:45:54,196
It was so refreshing and tasty.

815
00:45:55,435 --> 00:45:57,805
I'll never forget the taste.

816
00:45:59,805 --> 00:46:01,705
You got so drunk that day,

817
00:46:01,836 --> 00:46:05,146
you ended up saying all sorts of things.

818
00:46:05,575 --> 00:46:06,876
- I did? - Yes.

819
00:46:07,046 --> 00:46:08,146
What did I say?

820
00:46:10,986 --> 00:46:12,015
It's a secret.

821
00:46:12,785 --> 00:46:15,086
What? Tell me what I said.

822
00:46:15,486 --> 00:46:17,885
What did I say? Tell me.

823
00:46:17,885 --> 00:46:20,055
You'd be too embarrassed to see me again...

824
00:46:20,325 --> 00:46:21,396
if I told you.

825
00:46:21,396 --> 00:46:22,926
What?

826
00:46:23,466 --> 00:46:25,265
Now I'm dead curious.

827
00:46:25,265 --> 00:46:26,595
What did I say?

828
00:46:26,595 --> 00:46:28,196
Tell me already.

829
00:46:28,466 --> 00:46:29,935
I can't tell you.

830
00:46:30,506 --> 00:46:31,865
I'll take it to my grave.

831
00:46:32,606 --> 00:46:34,376
What the heck?

832
00:46:34,705 --> 00:46:37,245
You're so silly.

833
00:46:40,615 --> 00:46:41,845
My gosh.

834
00:46:48,285 --> 00:46:50,126
It's nice to have an old friend.

835
00:46:53,325 --> 00:46:54,896
To think I can laugh after what happened.

836
00:46:59,265 --> 00:47:02,066
Jang Soo will be in a much better place.

837
00:47:04,066 --> 00:47:07,075
He was a great guy.

838
00:47:11,046 --> 00:47:12,705
There was none like him.

839
00:47:16,986 --> 00:47:19,615
I heard you would close the brewery. Is that true?

840
00:47:20,055 --> 00:47:23,526
Our CEO died all of a sudden.

841
00:47:23,785 --> 00:47:25,555
We're in no state or situation...

842
00:47:26,356 --> 00:47:27,696
to keep things going.

843
00:47:28,825 --> 00:47:30,626
What are we to do now?

844
00:47:30,966 --> 00:47:34,095
My family offered your liquor at each rite since my father's time.

845
00:47:34,236 --> 00:47:36,265
This year might be the last.

846
00:47:36,265 --> 00:47:38,765
Yes. It looks like it.

847
00:47:38,935 --> 00:47:42,305
I'll order the usual five crates.

848
00:47:42,376 --> 00:47:44,006
If you have any to spare,

849
00:47:44,905 --> 00:47:46,575
sell me one more crate.

850
00:47:46,676 --> 00:47:48,475
I'll keep it for special occasions.

851
00:47:48,515 --> 00:47:49,515
Sure.

852
00:47:49,816 --> 00:47:51,716
Come with me. I'll load it for you.

853
00:47:52,946 --> 00:47:55,955
It's too nice a place to just shut down.

854
00:47:56,526 --> 00:47:58,685
Everything we value is disappearing one by one.

855

Rice grown in healthy soil.

Clear water that seeped through solid granite.

864
00:49:12,026 --> 00:49:13,166
- You too, Jang Soo. - Sure.

865
00:49:14,966 --> 00:49:17,966
Traditional nuruk made in a way that was passed down in the family.

866
00:49:18,365 --> 00:49:22,135
With those ingredients as well as genuine care and effort,

867
00:49:23,546 --> 00:49:26,046
anyone can brew good makgeolli.

871
00:49:39,526 --> 00:49:41,026
Hey, Ha Ni.

872
00:49:43,765 --> 00:49:46,796
Even though she's tiny, she has decent facial features.

873
00:49:47,535 --> 00:49:49,296
She'll break quite a few hearts in the future.

874
00:49:50,435 --> 00:49:51,705
She's a sweetheart.

875
00:49:52,336 --> 00:49:53,405
She's not fussy at all.

876
00:49:53,405 --> 00:49:54,506
Right?

877
00:49:55,575 --> 00:49:56,876
You heartless jerk.

878
00:49:56,876 --> 00:49:58,475
How could you pretend...

879
00:49:58,475 --> 00:50:00,345
not to have a sweet daughter like her?

880
00:50:01,546 --> 00:50:02,575
Goodness.

881
00:50:05,185 --> 00:50:06,285
Where's Kwang Sook?

882
00:50:06,716 --> 00:50:08,586
She's probably at the brewery.

883
00:50:08,916 --> 00:50:11,086
I broke a sweat trying to stop her...

884
00:50:11,086 --> 00:50:13,725
from repaying the wholesalers what Jang Soo received in advance.

885
00:50:14,196 --> 00:50:15,296
An advance payment?

886
00:50:16,966 --> 00:50:18,995
She can be quite gullible for her age.

887
00:50:19,865 --> 00:50:22,796
We should get her to her mother's before anything worse happens,

888
00:50:23,566 --> 00:50:26,106
but she won't leave giving us one reason after the other.

889
00:50:27,006 --> 00:50:28,336
We'll have her leave today.

890
00:50:30,176 --> 00:50:32,446
By the way, how did it go with the lawyer?

891
00:50:32,805 --> 00:50:34,676
Even if we close the brewery,

892
00:50:34,676 --> 00:50:36,216
it'll be hard to pay off all the debt.

893
00:50:36,946 --> 00:50:40,385
I believe our best option is to give up our inheritance.

894
00:50:44,825 --> 00:50:47,896
The lawyer left this with me.

895
00:50:48,155 --> 00:50:50,495
Once you fill it out and sign it with your seals,

896
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:51,926
I'll get it to Kang Soo.

897
00:50:52,966 --> 00:50:56,466
Will Eagle Brewery now become a distant memory?

899
00:51:03,705 --> 00:51:05,575
How can we look Jang Soo in the face again?

900
00:51:08,316 --> 00:51:10,115
There's nothing else we can do.

901
00:51:11,216 --> 00:51:12,586
He'll understand.

(Waiver of Inheritance)

903
00:51:21,455 --> 00:51:22,595
Wait.

904
00:51:36,405 --> 00:51:37,506
I'll take over.

905
00:51:39,006 --> 00:51:40,015
What?

906
00:51:41,916 --> 00:51:44,716
I'll take over the brewery.

907
00:51:45,416 --> 00:51:46,586
- You? - You?

908
00:51:48,316 --> 00:51:49,416
What...

909
00:51:50,756 --> 00:51:52,856
This isn't the moment for impromptu decisions.

910
00:51:52,856 --> 00:51:54,225
That's not what this is.

911
00:51:55,196 --> 00:51:56,356
All my life,

912
00:51:56,796 --> 00:51:58,825
I've never contemplated something for this long before.

913
00:51:59,725 --> 00:52:01,365
I only thought half a day...

914
00:52:01,896 --> 00:52:04,205
before deciding to marry Jang Soo.

915
00:52:08,535 --> 00:52:11,106
This brewery was Jang Soo's life,

916
00:52:12,606 --> 00:52:14,376
and I can't let it shut down.

917
00:52:16,015 --> 00:52:17,916
We understand where you're coming from,

918
00:52:17,916 --> 00:52:20,285
but who will brew the liquor?

919
00:52:21,185 --> 00:52:22,256
I will.

920
00:52:22,316 --> 00:52:23,356
- What? - What?

921
00:52:25,555 --> 00:52:26,555
(Work Journal)

922
00:52:28,955 --> 00:52:30,495
This is the work journal your brother kept.

923
00:52:32,126 --> 00:52:34,865
Everything is described in here.

924
00:52:35,495 --> 00:52:36,836
I only have to follow his instructions.

925
00:52:39,535 --> 00:52:41,236
It's not as easy as it sounds.

926
00:52:41,236 --> 00:52:42,236
What about the money?

927
00:52:42,805 --> 00:52:44,276
We have to pay inheritance tax...

928
00:52:44,276 --> 00:52:47,416
as well as settle payments with the banks and wholesalers.

929
00:52:47,845 --> 00:52:49,345
A plan to generate funds...

930
00:52:52,615 --> 00:52:54,986
is all in my head.

931
00:53:17,575 --> 00:53:20,446
Don't do this. This is wrong.

932
00:53:24,615 --> 00:53:27,285
My faith in you was the only reason I took over the brewery.

933
00:53:27,285 --> 00:53:29,185
You can't leave me hanging like this.

934
00:53:29,185 --> 00:53:32,285
How can I work with someone who knows nothing about makgeolli?

935
00:53:32,285 --> 00:53:34,426
I'll have to teach you every step of the way.

936
00:53:34,426 --> 00:53:37,966
Are you suggesting I die out of frustration?

937
00:53:38,426 --> 00:53:39,995
I'm more quick-witted than I seem.

938
00:53:39,995 --> 00:53:41,595
I won't frustrate you.

939
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:43,365
This conversation never happened.

940
00:53:44,566 --> 00:53:45,666
Okay, fine!

941
00:53:46,435 --> 00:53:48,506
How about a ten-percent raise? Deal?

942
00:53:48,506 --> 00:53:49,606
Forget it.

943
00:53:51,905 --> 00:53:53,946
Then how about a 20-percent raise? Deal?

944
00:53:53,946 --> 00:53:55,176
Forget it.

945
00:53:56,015 --> 00:53:57,146
Okay, fine.

946
00:53:58,816 --> 00:53:59,986
A 30-percent raise.

947
00:54:01,416 --> 00:54:02,555
What do you say?

948
00:54:09,356 --> 00:54:10,995
(Office)

949
00:54:13,026 --> 00:54:14,765
You gave me your word.

950
00:54:22,106 --> 00:54:23,776
- Deal. - Deal.

951
00:54:30,446 --> 00:54:33,216
(November Monthly Schedule)

952
00:54:34,185 --> 00:54:36,615
Jang Soo, the liquor you wanted to brew...

953
00:54:38,185 --> 00:54:39,555
I'll give it a shot.

954
00:54:41,655 --> 00:54:42,796
Lend me a hand...

955
00:54:43,765 --> 00:54:45,026
from above.

956
00:54:56,635 --> 00:54:57,676
Sir.

957
00:54:58,146 --> 00:54:59,805
It's time for your meeting.

958
00:55:02,245 --> 00:55:04,345
She said she'd be here at this exact time.

959
00:55:05,716 --> 00:55:07,856
I don't think she'll come by today.

960
00:55:07,916 --> 00:55:10,626
She wouldn't give up on 2,000 dollars.

961
00:55:11,426 --> 00:55:12,856
I'll let our staffers know...

962
00:55:12,856 --> 00:55:15,095
that she's to be escorted to the chairman's office.

963
00:55:15,526 --> 00:55:17,196
For now, you have a meeting to attend.

964
00:55:24,365 --> 00:55:26,135
You'll quit your job at the post office...

965
00:55:26,135 --> 00:55:27,635
and run the brewery?

966
00:55:28,236 --> 00:55:29,236
Yes.

967
00:55:29,805 --> 00:55:31,506
As my late husband wanted,

968
00:55:31,506 --> 00:55:33,075
I will make Eagle Brewery...

969
00:55:33,075 --> 00:55:35,276
the best brewery in Korea.

970
00:55:37,185 --> 00:55:41,285
Ms. Ma, I see the shock got to your head.

971
00:55:44,026 --> 00:55:47,196
Ms. Ma, get a grip on yourself.

972
00:55:47,225 --> 00:55:49,756
Sir, I don't think...

973
00:55:49,756 --> 00:55:51,765
my mind has ever been clearer.

974
00:55:53,796 --> 00:55:55,135
I will wrap up...

975
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:57,365
my first chapter in life as a postal civil servant...

976
00:55:57,365 --> 00:56:00,276
and begin my next chapter in life.

977
00:56:00,276 --> 00:56:02,705
How could you run the brewery...

978
00:56:02,705 --> 00:56:04,745
when you know nothing about liquor?

979
00:56:04,745 --> 00:56:06,575
I know enough.

980
00:56:06,575 --> 00:56:09,376
Is there anyone here who can drink as much as I can?

981
00:56:09,816 --> 00:56:12,416
Hey. That's a different matter.

982
00:56:12,416 --> 00:56:13,615
There's nothing different about it.

983
00:56:14,086 --> 00:56:16,185
Anyway, because of the situation at the brewery,

984
00:56:16,185 --> 00:56:17,555
I urgently need some money,

985
00:56:17,555 --> 00:56:19,486
so put a rush on my severance pay...

986
00:56:19,486 --> 00:56:21,725
and put in a good word that allows me a loan.

987
00:56:21,725 --> 00:56:23,626
My gosh.

988
00:56:25,196 --> 00:56:26,265
Just leave.

989
00:56:32,705 --> 00:56:35,006
The lady didn't show up.

990
00:56:36,876 --> 00:56:37,876
All right.

991
00:56:43,176 --> 00:56:45,986
What I said must've shocked her.

992
00:56:46,986 --> 00:56:48,655
This is horrible.

993
00:57:36,066 --> 00:57:39,006
Act your age, will you?

994
00:57:39,135 --> 00:57:41,006
This is extremely childish, you know.

995
00:57:43,975 --> 00:57:47,615
You ladies should be telling your grandchildren...

996
00:57:47,615 --> 00:57:50,146
not to bully their classmates or ostracize them.

997
00:57:50,345 --> 00:57:52,086
How shameful of you.

998
00:57:52,086 --> 00:57:53,916
So much for aging wisely.

999
00:57:55,015 --> 00:57:56,986
Was that for me to hear?

1000
00:57:57,555 --> 00:58:00,155
You, you, and you!

1001
00:58:00,595 --> 00:58:02,126
That was for all you three to hear.

1002
00:58:02,495 --> 00:58:03,595
"You three?"

1003
00:58:04,066 --> 00:58:05,626
Have you no respect for your elders?

1004
00:58:05,626 --> 00:58:07,466
How dare you speak in that manner?

1005
00:58:07,466 --> 00:58:09,396
You and I are the same age.

1006
00:58:09,396 --> 00:58:10,865
You just look ten years older...

1007
00:58:10,865 --> 00:58:12,765
for not taking better care of your skin and figure.

1008
00:58:13,006 --> 00:58:16,236
Why you... How dare you speak to me like that?

1009
00:58:17,745 --> 00:58:18,745
Hey!

1010
00:58:24,385 --> 00:58:25,816
My gosh.

1011
00:58:30,685 --> 00:58:31,756
Goodness me.

1012
00:58:32,256 --> 00:58:34,256
Leave Golden Castle immediately!

1013
00:58:34,325 --> 00:58:36,196
A lowly skank like you...

1014
00:58:36,296 --> 00:58:38,725
has no place in our retirement home.

1015
00:58:38,725 --> 00:58:39,865
Ma'am!

1016
00:58:40,966 --> 00:58:43,595
I begged you to be careful,

1017
00:58:43,736 --> 00:58:45,635
so why are you causing another commotion?

1018
00:58:45,635 --> 00:58:46,935
Why are you only on my case?

1019
00:58:47,066 --> 00:58:48,805
Why aren't you telling them off too?

1020
00:58:48,805 --> 00:58:50,405
That's because...

1021
00:58:50,405 --> 00:58:52,106
you started it.

1022
00:58:52,106 --> 00:58:53,946
How was I the one who started this?

1023
00:58:53,946 --> 00:58:55,216
It was them!

1024
00:59:04,225 --> 00:59:05,426
You're leaving with me, Mom.

1025
00:59:06,455 --> 00:59:07,955
We'll live together...

1026
00:59:08,095 --> 00:59:10,926
at a place a thousand times better than here.

1027
00:59:11,566 --> 00:59:13,725
Let your daughter care for you now.

1028
00:59:31,546 --> 00:59:33,046
(Jimbong Taxi)

1029
00:59:43,725 --> 00:59:44,796
Why are we here?

1030
00:59:45,296 --> 00:59:46,626
I told you...

1031
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:48,365
I'd care for you.

1032
00:59:49,566 --> 00:59:52,066
You're caring for me in here?

1033
00:59:52,466 --> 00:59:56,075
Yes, I'm taking over the brewery.

1034
00:59:56,836 --> 00:59:57,905
What?

1035
00:59:58,376 --> 01:00:00,075
You're running the brewery?

1036
01:00:00,475 --> 01:00:02,676
I couldn't just let it shut down...

1037
01:00:02,946 --> 01:00:04,845
when this was Jang Soo's life.

1038
01:00:05,916 --> 01:00:07,146
What about the post office?

1039
01:00:07,385 --> 01:00:08,685
I turned in my resignation.

1040
01:00:09,115 --> 01:00:10,385
What the...

1041
01:00:10,385 --> 01:00:12,026
Have you lost your mind?

1042
01:00:12,086 --> 01:00:13,086
But...

1043
01:00:13,325 --> 01:00:14,825
- Why you... - Mom!

1044
01:00:14,825 --> 01:00:17,126
I'll do better, okay?

1045
01:00:17,126 --> 01:00:18,296
Mom, please.

1046
01:00:18,296 --> 01:00:19,296
Stop!

1047
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:22,466
Stop. Don't unload my things...

1048
01:00:22,736 --> 01:00:24,435
and take them back to Golden Castle.

1049
01:00:26,106 --> 01:00:29,506
I already got back the deposit.

1050
01:00:30,075 --> 01:00:31,075
What?

1051
01:00:31,276 --> 01:00:34,716
The deposit from that place has been invested into the brewery.

1052
01:00:34,816 --> 01:00:38,185
You're now the largest shareholder of Eagle Brewery.

1053
01:00:38,285 --> 01:00:39,845
You've lost your mind!

1054
01:00:39,885 --> 01:00:42,256
You're like a robber with no weapon.

1055
01:00:42,416 --> 01:00:43,856
Who said you could invest that money?

1056
01:00:43,926 --> 01:00:46,285
- Give me back my money. - But...

1057
01:00:46,285 --> 01:00:49,026
I'll earn a lot of money and pay dividends.

1058
01:00:49,026 --> 01:00:50,825
Are you kidding me?

1059
01:00:50,966 --> 01:00:54,635
You're not a daughter but the worst thief of all!

1060
01:00:54,635 --> 01:00:55,736
Boss,

1061
01:00:56,435 --> 01:00:57,506
you're back.

1062
01:00:58,336 --> 01:00:59,365
Hey.

1063
01:00:59,935 --> 01:01:01,236
The chairwoman is here too.

1064
01:01:01,236 --> 01:01:03,435
(Eagle Brewery)

1065
01:01:05,475 --> 01:01:06,546
Who's he?

1066
01:01:06,876 --> 01:01:08,015
Mr. Go, the brewery manager.

1067
01:01:10,845 --> 01:01:12,015
He's quite burly.

1068
01:01:12,716 --> 01:01:13,745
Right.

1069
01:01:17,486 --> 01:01:19,626
Come on. Let's go, Mom.

1070
01:01:20,486 --> 01:01:22,495
Here. Come on in.

1071
01:01:22,495 --> 01:01:25,495
(Eagle Brewery)

1072
01:01:38,475 --> 01:01:41,146
(Eagle Brewery)

1073
01:01:55,495 --> 01:01:56,595
Is anyone here?

1074
01:02:03,666 --> 01:02:04,736
Goodness.

1075
01:02:05,765 --> 01:02:07,265
What brings you here?

1076
01:02:13,475 --> 01:02:15,216
I came by to give you something.

1077
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:18,385
How did you know I lived here?

1078
01:02:20,185 --> 01:02:22,416
Hold on. Did you track me down?

1079
01:02:25,785 --> 01:02:28,856
The brewery had a memorable name, so I came by just in case.

1080
01:02:29,655 --> 01:02:30,995
I see I'm in the right place.

1081
01:02:34,135 --> 01:02:37,135
You weren't at the hotel at the time we agreed upon.

1082
01:02:38,236 --> 01:02:40,705
Oh, right. That slipped my mind.

1083
01:02:41,305 --> 01:02:43,006
This was one busy day for me.

1084
01:02:47,075 --> 01:02:49,546
It's for the damage to your wedding dress.

1085
01:02:50,845 --> 01:02:51,885
Goodness.

1086
01:02:56,185 --> 01:02:57,926
I didn't think I'd get paid so easily,

1087
01:02:58,455 --> 01:03:00,126
but you're more conscientious than I thought.

1088
01:03:00,586 --> 01:03:01,696
Thank you.

1089
01:03:03,225 --> 01:03:06,666
I didn't mean to, but I was out of line yesterday.

1090
01:03:08,736 --> 01:03:10,466
Now that I've given that to you...

1091
01:03:10,865 --> 01:03:11,966
Just a second.

1092
01:03:21,676 --> 01:03:22,916
Have this cover your medical expenses.

1093
01:03:23,515 --> 01:03:25,115
I'm the reason you tweaked your back.

1094
01:03:26,146 --> 01:03:27,185
It's fine.

1095
01:03:27,416 --> 01:03:30,086
You have to open doors and carry suitcases all day.

1096
01:03:30,455 --> 01:03:32,785
Your back health is important, so it should be treated well.

1097
01:03:33,426 --> 01:03:34,495
Please take it.

1098
01:03:34,495 --> 01:03:37,196
I'm better now, so it's all right.

1099
01:03:38,126 --> 01:03:39,865
I'd feel guilty, then.

1100
01:03:40,935 --> 01:03:42,635
There's no reason to feel guilty.

1101
01:03:42,995 --> 01:03:45,336
Our transaction is complete, so goodbye.

1102
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:48,435
Just a second! Hold on.

1103
01:03:50,236 --> 01:03:51,446
What now?

1104
01:03:51,876 --> 01:03:52,975
Wait here, then.

1105
01:04:02,756 --> 01:04:03,955
Have some after work.

1106
01:04:05,756 --> 01:04:07,455
Nothing is better than makgeolli...

1107
01:04:07,696 --> 01:04:09,296
for those who do physical labor.

1108
01:04:11,626 --> 01:04:14,135
Sure. Bye, then.

1109
01:04:15,265 --> 01:04:17,535
I was in the middle of something and can't see you out.

1110
01:04:20,435 --> 01:04:22,676
Luck will find you, mister!

(Jang-Kwang liquor)

1120
01:06:06,646 --> 01:06:08,216
Get tastier...

1121
01:06:08,515 --> 01:06:09,945
and tastier.

1122
01:06:10,676 --> 01:06:12,916
Abracadabra.

In a bottle of fine makgeolli,

1126

all four seasons are present.

1127
01:06:25,626 --> 01:06:28,596
The subtle scent of cherry blossoms in the makgeolli of spring.

1128
01:06:30,535 --> 01:06:33,136
The freshness of grass in the makgeolli of summer.

1129
01:06:34,275 --> 01:06:37,035
The aroma of dried fallen leaves in the makgeolli of fall.

1130
01:06:38,245 --> 01:06:40,876
And the makgeolli of winter...

1131
01:06:41,115 --> 01:06:42,745
tingles the tip of your nose.

1132
01:06:45,686 --> 01:06:48,155
Only when you present what nature allows...

1133
01:06:48,516 --> 01:06:50,485
can the makgeolli of Eagle Brewery...

1138
01:08:04,025 --> 01:08:06,096
Makgeolli should be...

1139
01:08:06,096 --> 01:08:08,296
rustic and approachable.

1140
01:08:08,296 --> 01:08:09,936
We tested the new product,

1141
01:08:09,936 --> 01:08:11,166
and we got a great response.

1142
01:08:11,166 --> 01:08:12,535
Oh, no. What's happening?

1143
01:08:12,806 --> 01:08:14,336
The copier's out of order.

1144
01:08:14,476 --> 01:08:16,075
A guy came to fix it.

1145
01:08:16,075 --> 01:08:18,376
You should fix it. Who else?

1146
01:08:18,575 --> 01:08:21,615
To be honest, you left a bad first impression.

1147
01:08:22,046 --> 01:08:23,745
But I see you in a new light now.

1148
01:08:24,016 --> 01:08:25,145
Wait.

1149
01:08:25,245 --> 01:08:27,346
Will you wait for a moment?

1150
01:08:27,916 --> 01:08:29,355
I have something to say.
