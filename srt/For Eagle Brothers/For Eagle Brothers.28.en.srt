1
00:00:02,102 --> 00:00:03,432
Chairman Han...

2
00:00:03,432 --> 00:00:05,972
isn't the type to ask for favors or give recommendations.

3
00:00:06,242 --> 00:00:08,612
However, the way he praised Jang-Kwang yakju...

4
00:00:08,612 --> 00:00:11,412
deepened my curiosity for it.

5
00:00:11,412 --> 00:00:12,682
That's why I asked to meet with you.

6
00:00:17,482 --> 00:00:18,482
Thank you.

7
00:00:19,322 --> 00:00:20,922
Eagle Brewery is a 90-year-old brewery,

8
00:00:20,922 --> 00:00:22,552
carrying on a tradition...

9
00:00:22,552 --> 00:00:24,792
that has been passed down through three generations.

10
00:00:34,332 --> 00:00:36,572
Organic rice from partnered farms,

11
00:00:36,572 --> 00:00:39,072
homemade traditional nuruk,

12
00:00:39,072 --> 00:00:40,942
and natural bedrock water.

13
00:00:40,942 --> 00:00:43,172
Our liquor is crafted using only those three ingredients.

14
00:00:43,172 --> 00:00:45,742
We strive to achieve natural flavors.

15
00:00:48,912 --> 00:00:50,582
This has been chilled for you.

16
00:00:50,582 --> 00:00:52,222
Would you like to taste it?

17
00:00:52,222 --> 00:00:54,852
Of course. I can't wait.

18
00:00:57,422 --> 00:00:59,022
Here. Allow me.

19
00:01:04,162 --> 00:01:05,302
Here you go.

20
00:01:05,302 --> 00:01:06,362
Thanks.

21
00:01:30,652 --> 00:01:32,062
A touch of acidity...

22
00:01:32,062 --> 00:01:33,822
and a pleasantly bitter finish.

23
00:01:34,222 --> 00:01:35,292
It's mesmerizing.

24
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:37,432
The flavors are clean and impressive.

25
00:02:02,392 --> 00:02:05,562
What about your driver?

26
00:02:08,592 --> 00:02:11,702
I wanted to drive you home myself,

27
00:02:11,702 --> 00:02:13,132
so I let him leave early.

28
00:02:14,302 --> 00:02:16,702
I could've just taken a cab home.

29
00:02:17,002 --> 00:02:18,772
Why would I make you take a cab...

30
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:20,702
when all I had to do was spare a little of my time?

31
00:02:23,372 --> 00:02:26,842
I know you don't know me very well yet,

32
00:02:28,112 --> 00:02:30,482
but I'm the sweetest person...

33
00:02:30,482 --> 00:02:33,152
when it comes to the people I care about.

34
00:02:41,092 --> 00:02:42,092
Are you hot?

35
00:02:42,692 --> 00:02:43,732
Yes.

36
00:02:44,432 --> 00:02:46,232
I must've already hit menopause.

37
00:02:47,102 --> 00:02:48,672
I doubt that.

38
00:02:50,102 --> 00:02:51,102
Sorry?

39
00:02:51,402 --> 00:02:53,102
The symptoms may vary,

40
00:02:53,772 --> 00:02:56,142
but I think you have what I have.

41
00:02:56,642 --> 00:02:57,742
What you have?

42
00:02:58,482 --> 00:02:59,612
What is it that you have?

43
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:04,782
You'll find out one day.

44
00:03:06,852 --> 00:03:08,252
I know I did.

45
00:03:20,932 --> 00:03:22,472
Chairman Han,

46
00:03:24,802 --> 00:03:28,372
I appreciate you thinking highly of me,

47
00:03:29,972 --> 00:03:32,082
but it makes me a bit uncomfortable.

48
00:03:34,112 --> 00:03:36,552
Why are you so uneasy about that?

49
00:03:38,182 --> 00:03:39,382
As you know,

50
00:03:40,222 --> 00:03:43,022
I was only recently widowed.

51
00:03:44,622 --> 00:03:47,922
I also have a close bond with my brothers-in-law.

52
00:03:49,432 --> 00:03:50,632
But most of all,

53
00:03:51,392 --> 00:03:53,132
the life you've lived...

54
00:03:53,602 --> 00:03:55,472
is nothing like mine.

55
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:58,872
I have three meals a day just like anyone else.

56
00:03:59,502 --> 00:04:01,242
What could be that different?

57
00:04:01,572 --> 00:04:04,542
That's something only someone...

58
00:04:04,542 --> 00:04:06,412
in your position would say.

59
00:04:08,712 --> 00:04:12,182
I'm also worried that you might've misunderstood...

60
00:04:12,582 --> 00:04:13,822
this whole situation.

61
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:17,092
What am I misunderstanding?

62
00:04:19,162 --> 00:04:21,932
You suddenly developed feelings for me.

63
00:04:23,892 --> 00:04:25,002
Are you saying...

64
00:04:25,902 --> 00:04:28,032
I was just being impulsive?

65
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:31,202
I confirmed everything that I was feeling.

66
00:04:31,702 --> 00:04:34,042
I kept asking myself...

67
00:04:34,042 --> 00:04:36,942
if I could take responsibility for what I was about to say.

68
00:04:37,242 --> 00:04:38,982
This wasn't a rash decision.

69
00:04:41,282 --> 00:04:43,712
That's why...

70
00:04:44,382 --> 00:04:47,552
I have no intention of taking back my confession.

71
00:04:57,292 --> 00:04:59,432
I'm well aware...

72
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:01,702
that you wouldn't confess your feelings...

73
00:05:02,832 --> 00:05:04,172
on impulse.

74
00:05:05,242 --> 00:05:08,772
However, this was unexpected for me,

75
00:05:09,872 --> 00:05:11,042
and...

76
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:14,842
I also need time to understand my feelings.

77
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,312
How much time do you need?

78
00:05:19,522 --> 00:05:21,382
- Pardon? - How much time do you need?

79
00:05:24,352 --> 00:05:26,292
How long do you want me to wait?

80
00:05:29,232 --> 00:05:30,232
I'm not sure.

81
00:05:31,662 --> 00:05:32,732
Maybe a month?

82
00:05:32,962 --> 00:05:35,872
Why do you have to take so long? It's too long.

83
00:05:37,302 --> 00:05:38,342
Then...

84
00:05:39,142 --> 00:05:40,172
what about 20 days?

85
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:44,812
Let's cut it in half...

86
00:05:45,382 --> 00:05:46,582
and make it ten days.

87
00:05:47,542 --> 00:05:49,452
How can I decide something so important...

88
00:05:50,052 --> 00:05:51,882
only in ten days?

89
00:05:53,852 --> 00:05:55,992
You don't get a perfect score for holding onto the answer sheet...

90
00:05:55,992 --> 00:05:57,092
for too long during a test.

91
00:05:57,952 --> 00:06:00,662
In situations like this, it is better to focus...

92
00:06:01,062 --> 00:06:03,692
and make a decision with your animal instincts.

93
00:06:07,702 --> 00:06:08,702
Then,

94
00:06:10,072 --> 00:06:12,202
please give me some time to think quietly...

95
00:06:13,302 --> 00:06:15,042
so I can make my decision.

96
00:06:17,172 --> 00:06:18,742
Please don't keep asking to meet up...

97
00:06:18,842 --> 00:06:20,612
or put pressure on me on the phone.

98
00:06:21,712 --> 00:06:24,052
Give me enough time to think about it...

99
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,382
on my own.

100
00:06:34,162 --> 00:06:35,592
Okay. I will.

101
00:06:37,632 --> 00:06:38,702
I'll do that.

102
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:52,042
Let's at least text each other once a day.

103
00:06:53,512 --> 00:06:54,512
What?

104
00:06:54,782 --> 00:06:57,852
At the very least, I need to know if you're doing okay...

105
00:06:58,252 --> 00:07:00,482
and that you're not sick.

106
00:07:01,722 --> 00:07:03,622
Let me do that much at least.

107
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:06,792
Okay.

108
00:07:07,522 --> 00:07:11,632
Then let's just text each other once a day.

109
00:07:14,262 --> 00:07:15,402
Let's do that.

110
00:07:21,242 --> 00:07:24,172
(Eagle Brewery)

111
00:07:32,682 --> 00:07:34,622
(Loan Maturity Notice)

112
00:07:38,522 --> 00:07:40,222
What? Oh, dear.

113
00:07:41,192 --> 00:07:42,262
Kwang Sook.

114
00:07:42,332 --> 00:07:43,492
I'm back.

115
00:07:44,592 --> 00:07:46,062
Did the meeting go well?

116
00:07:46,602 --> 00:07:49,772
Yes. We'll hear from them soon.

117
00:07:50,232 --> 00:07:51,942
I have a good feeling.

118
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:55,612
By the way, Kwang Sook, we got a letter from the bank...

119
00:07:56,412 --> 00:07:59,842
saying that the loan extension wasn't approved...

120
00:08:00,282 --> 00:08:02,782
and we should pay it off by the due date.

121
00:08:07,652 --> 00:08:08,992
I think we need to prepare...

122
00:08:09,392 --> 00:08:11,252
for the exports to the US...

123
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:13,322
after taking care of the loan,

124
00:08:13,422 --> 00:08:14,622
but we have only ten days left.

125
00:08:23,272 --> 00:08:25,002
I have one more thing to deal with...

126
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,502
in ten days.

127
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:42,122
Should I have been sterner and made it five days?

128
00:08:44,552 --> 00:08:46,722
Ten days is just too long.

129
00:08:54,832 --> 00:08:55,872
Come in.

130
00:09:01,242 --> 00:09:02,712
Can I talk to you for a moment?

131
00:09:03,012 --> 00:09:04,012
What is it about?

132
00:09:05,112 --> 00:09:08,242
Se Ri came to the company earlier today.

133
00:09:11,282 --> 00:09:13,482
I was surprised that she was getting married so soon,

134
00:09:13,482 --> 00:09:15,252
and now she says she's not getting married.

135
00:09:15,252 --> 00:09:16,492
How can this be?

136
00:09:17,052 --> 00:09:18,492
Honestly, I don't understand her.

137
00:09:19,662 --> 00:09:20,892
It's not Se Ri's fault.

138
00:09:22,192 --> 00:09:23,392
It's my fault too.

139
00:09:25,402 --> 00:09:27,502
We've known each other since we were little.

140
00:09:27,502 --> 00:09:31,332
I just found her familiar, cute, and lovable,

141
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:35,242
so I vaguely thought it'd be a good idea to marry her.

142
00:09:38,642 --> 00:09:41,312
I should have more desperate feelings than that.

143
00:09:43,512 --> 00:09:46,252
And Se Ri realized it before I did.

144
00:09:48,022 --> 00:09:49,222
She didn't do anything wrong.

145
00:09:51,552 --> 00:09:53,792
When are you going to tell Dad?

146
00:09:57,492 --> 00:09:58,702
I should tell him soon.

147
00:10:01,162 --> 00:10:03,232
Are you out of your mind? Have you gone crazy?

148
00:10:03,672 --> 00:10:06,172
I met Gyeol and barely sorted things out.

149
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:08,142
Why did you tell Bom about the professor?

150
00:10:08,772 --> 00:10:11,242
Gyeol said he respected my feelings.

151
00:10:12,282 --> 00:10:13,942
And we called off the marriage.

152
00:10:14,212 --> 00:10:16,682
Who said you could call it off?

153
00:10:16,752 --> 00:10:18,312
It's about my marriage, Mom.

154
00:10:18,312 --> 00:10:21,522
Just because it's your marriage, is it okay to get your own way...

155
00:10:21,522 --> 00:10:23,092
ignoring your parents' opinion?

156
00:10:23,252 --> 00:10:24,922
Do you think your parents are just puppets?

157
00:10:25,122 --> 00:10:28,422
Don't be so angry and try to understand my feelings.

158
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:31,432
I'm in deathly agony now.

159
00:10:31,662 --> 00:10:32,762
Why are you so distressed?

160
00:10:33,832 --> 00:10:36,532
You're just upset that the professor doesn't love you back.

161
00:10:36,772 --> 00:10:38,472
You don't care about your mom and dad.

162
00:10:38,802 --> 00:10:41,202
The only thing on your mind is the professor now!

163
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:44,742
Even if things don't work out with the professor,

164
00:10:44,812 --> 00:10:46,942
I can't marry Gyeol.

165
00:10:47,182 --> 00:10:49,382
I just can't do that to him.

166
00:10:50,012 --> 00:10:51,212
What is she talking about?

167
00:10:51,382 --> 00:10:52,782
What you shouldn't do is...

168
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:55,852
calling off your marriage by falling in love...

169
00:10:55,852 --> 00:10:58,622
with a divorced man with a child. You got that?

170
00:10:59,262 --> 00:11:01,362
What nonsense are they talking about?

171
00:11:02,292 --> 00:11:03,992
Don't say that.

172
00:11:04,392 --> 00:11:06,002
Professor Oh didn't do anything wrong.

173
00:11:06,162 --> 00:11:08,532
You fell in love with a divorced man with a child?

174
00:11:10,772 --> 00:11:12,072
Is what she said true?

175
00:11:13,702 --> 00:11:15,872
Se Ri, answer my question.

176
00:11:16,612 --> 00:11:20,242
Is it true that you fell in love with a divorced man with a child?

177
00:11:24,252 --> 00:11:25,582
It's not that we fell in love.

178
00:11:26,882 --> 00:11:28,382
I have a crush on him, Dad.

179
00:11:29,452 --> 00:11:30,522
What?

180
00:11:30,922 --> 00:11:32,592
It's nothing serious.

181
00:11:33,122 --> 00:11:34,922
Se Ri's professor is a single dad.

182
00:11:34,922 --> 00:11:38,132
He's raising a baby on his own without a wife.

183
00:11:38,132 --> 00:11:39,932
She feels bad for him and pities him.

184
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:42,232
So she grew attached to him after spending some time with him...

185
00:11:42,232 --> 00:11:43,332
Darn it!

186
00:11:46,242 --> 00:11:47,972
How could you fall...

187
00:11:48,202 --> 00:11:50,612
for a divorced man with a child of all people?

188
00:11:53,982 --> 00:11:55,582
Your wedding date was not far off.

189
00:11:55,752 --> 00:11:57,952
When you had a perfectly decent man,

190
00:11:58,412 --> 00:12:01,252
how could you fall for some worthless loser like that?

191
00:12:03,652 --> 00:12:06,662
Mi Ae, what have you been doing?

192
00:12:07,362 --> 00:12:09,532
Can't you take care of your only daughter properly?

193
00:12:09,932 --> 00:12:12,332
What have you been doing at home the whole time?

194
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:15,002
You just stay at home as a sponger...

195
00:12:15,032 --> 00:12:16,972
thinking about how to spend more money!

196
00:12:16,972 --> 00:12:17,972
Honey, calm down.

197
00:12:17,972 --> 00:12:20,102
Calm down, honey. It's all my fault.

198
00:12:20,602 --> 00:12:21,602
What are you waiting for?

199
00:12:21,942 --> 00:12:24,712
Hurry and ask your dad for forgiveness.

200
00:12:24,712 --> 00:12:27,712
- Get off me. - Stop it. Go ahead and tell him...

201
00:12:27,712 --> 00:12:29,512
that you'll get things right!

202
00:12:29,812 --> 00:12:32,752
What are you doing? Go ahead and beg him!

203
00:12:32,782 --> 00:12:34,052
Honey.

204
00:12:34,052 --> 00:12:35,852
Se Ri!

205
00:12:35,852 --> 00:12:36,922
- Darn it! - Honey.

206
00:13:08,222 --> 00:13:09,222
What?

207
00:13:09,952 --> 00:13:10,952
Se Ri?

208
00:13:12,522 --> 00:13:13,692
Lieutenant Oh.

209
00:13:14,422 --> 00:13:15,662
What are you doing here?

210
00:13:16,692 --> 00:13:17,962
Well... The thing is...

211
00:13:20,462 --> 00:13:22,232
I came because there was someone I wanted to see.

212
00:13:24,272 --> 00:13:26,842
By the way, what brings you here?

213
00:13:27,302 --> 00:13:28,602
My brother lives in this building.

214
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:30,742
I see.

215
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:33,312
Beom Soo.

216
00:13:34,412 --> 00:13:35,412
Hey, Kang Soo.

217
00:13:37,382 --> 00:13:38,412
Professor.

218
00:13:47,222 --> 00:13:49,932
Are you here to meet my brother?

219
00:13:55,472 --> 00:13:56,802
Well... Yes.

220
00:14:01,142 --> 00:14:02,412
Why did you come here at this hour of the night?

221
00:14:05,342 --> 00:14:07,142
My dad is really angry.

222
00:14:09,012 --> 00:14:10,652
I ran away to avoid him,

223
00:14:12,252 --> 00:14:14,082
but I had nowhere to go.

224
00:14:15,052 --> 00:14:16,522
Why is your dad angry?

225
00:14:18,252 --> 00:14:19,562
Is it because of me?

226
00:14:20,222 --> 00:14:22,262
No, it's not because of you.

227
00:14:23,792 --> 00:14:25,502
He's angry because of me.

228
00:14:30,902 --> 00:14:33,072
But still, you can't come here.

229
00:14:33,842 --> 00:14:35,442
What if you didn't run into me?

230
00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:38,012
I didn't come here to meet you.

231
00:14:39,042 --> 00:14:41,112
I just wandered around following my heart,

232
00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:43,882
and I ended up here.

233
00:14:50,052 --> 00:14:51,092
Se Ri.

234
00:14:54,192 --> 00:14:56,132
I know you adore Ha Ni...

235
00:14:56,162 --> 00:14:58,092
and care about me.

236
00:14:58,592 --> 00:15:00,202
I know how you feel, and I appreciate it.

237
00:15:00,862 --> 00:15:01,862
But...

238
00:15:02,802 --> 00:15:03,872
in the world we live in,

239
00:15:03,872 --> 00:15:05,842
there's such a thing as common sense and culture.

240
00:15:07,302 --> 00:15:10,142
There are rules that they've created over a long period of time,

241
00:15:10,972 --> 00:15:12,442
and you can't ignore them.

242
00:15:13,742 --> 00:15:16,082
Don't try to convince me.

243
00:15:18,822 --> 00:15:20,352
I'm not a child.

244
00:15:22,592 --> 00:15:24,222
I thought about it long enough.

245
00:15:29,632 --> 00:15:31,732
I'll like you on my own...

246
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:33,832
so it doesn't inconvenience you.

247
00:15:34,232 --> 00:15:37,032
I'm not saying this because you're an inconvenience.

248
00:15:38,102 --> 00:15:39,472
I'm worried about you.

249
00:15:39,472 --> 00:15:41,442
If you're that worried about me,

250
00:15:42,712 --> 00:15:44,472
don't keep pushing me away.

251
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:49,112
Can't you accept me the way I am?

252
00:15:53,722 --> 00:15:55,452
Don't think about anything else.

253
00:15:57,792 --> 00:16:00,562
Just consider my feelings.

254
00:16:22,552 --> 00:16:23,852
It's funny, isn't it?

255
00:16:25,752 --> 00:16:26,752
Dad's back.

256
00:16:27,582 --> 00:16:28,752
Did Se Ri leave?

257
00:16:29,222 --> 00:16:30,252
Yes.

258
00:16:30,992 --> 00:16:31,992
So...

259
00:16:32,962 --> 00:16:34,622
how do you know her?

260
00:16:34,762 --> 00:16:36,832
I told you about Bom, didn't I?

261
00:16:37,132 --> 00:16:39,562
Oh, the hotel chairman's daughter?

262
00:16:39,702 --> 00:16:41,762
Yes. The two are best friends,

263
00:16:41,762 --> 00:16:42,832
so I met them both.

264
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:45,432
She came to work today to see Bom.

265
00:16:47,442 --> 00:16:48,542
Have you met...

266
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:51,372
Se Ri's mother too?

267
00:16:51,942 --> 00:16:53,112
Se Ri's mother?

268
00:16:53,882 --> 00:16:55,012
No. Why?

269
00:16:57,152 --> 00:16:58,252
It's nothing.

270
00:17:00,622 --> 00:17:03,692
- Ha Ni. - Daddy's back.

271
00:17:04,622 --> 00:17:07,222
Why did Se Ri want to see you?

272
00:17:08,692 --> 00:17:09,962
She's in my class,

273
00:17:10,292 --> 00:17:11,962
and she was my TA up until recently.

274
00:17:13,362 --> 00:17:14,902
It felt a bit weird.

275
00:17:15,672 --> 00:17:17,332
Are you two dating?

276
00:17:17,332 --> 00:17:20,302
I wouldn't dare date someone like her.

277
00:17:20,302 --> 00:17:23,142
Why would you say that?

278
00:17:23,272 --> 00:17:26,842
I mean Se Ri's too naive and sweet.

279
00:17:26,842 --> 00:17:29,682
She felt sorry to see me with Ha Ni.

280
00:17:30,412 --> 00:17:32,082
I think that's what happened.

281
00:17:32,882 --> 00:17:35,652
She's smart, so she'll come to her senses soon.

282
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,262
What are you doing here out of the blue?

283
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:41,792
I dropped by on my way home.

284
00:17:42,492 --> 00:17:44,062
I hadn't seen Ha Ni in a while.

285
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:46,432
How's the brewery going?

286
00:17:47,662 --> 00:17:49,802
Silla Brewery apologized,

287
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:52,502
but no one wants to sell our product yet.

288
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:55,912
It'll take a while to recover.

289
00:17:56,812 --> 00:17:59,112
I hope the brewery can survive until then.

290
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:01,812
Heung Soo dropped off 20,000 dollars...

291
00:18:01,812 --> 00:18:03,512
to put toward paying off...

292
00:18:03,512 --> 00:18:04,882
the bank loan yesterday.

293
00:18:05,152 --> 00:18:06,652
Where did he get that much money?

294
00:18:06,982 --> 00:18:09,522
He said his choreography sold and he signed a deal.

295
00:18:10,992 --> 00:18:13,062
That's great news.

296
00:18:13,062 --> 00:18:14,092
Yes.

297
00:18:14,192 --> 00:18:17,462
But we're worried because it's hardly enough.

298
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:20,502
Don't worry too much.

299
00:18:21,162 --> 00:18:22,702
I have an idea.

300
00:18:28,342 --> 00:18:31,142
There you are. Enjoy the drink and sweat it all out.

301
00:18:31,142 --> 00:18:32,412
Swipe your locker key.

302
00:18:33,842 --> 00:18:35,142
Thanks for the payment.

303
00:18:35,142 --> 00:18:36,482
Have a good time.

304
00:18:36,752 --> 00:18:37,782
Thanks.

305
00:18:41,282 --> 00:18:42,282
Hey.

306
00:18:44,622 --> 00:18:45,622
Hi, Kwang Sook.

307
00:18:45,722 --> 00:18:47,922
Did you have dinner?

308
00:18:47,922 --> 00:18:49,862
Of course, I did. It's late.

309
00:18:49,992 --> 00:18:51,262
I just ate.

310
00:18:52,532 --> 00:18:54,032
I called...

311
00:18:54,602 --> 00:18:56,802
because I feel grateful and guilty.

312
00:18:57,632 --> 00:18:59,502
You worked hard for the money,

313
00:18:59,502 --> 00:19:02,142
and I'm not sure if I should spend it all.

314
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:03,712
Come on.

315
00:19:04,372 --> 00:19:07,882
I'm so pleased and proud that I can do something...

316
00:19:07,882 --> 00:19:09,612
for you and the family.

317
00:19:10,012 --> 00:19:11,182
Don't say that.

318
00:19:12,252 --> 00:19:13,552
Thanks, Heung Soo.

319
00:19:14,752 --> 00:19:17,522
Kwang Sook. I'll become hugely successful...

320
00:19:17,522 --> 00:19:19,022
so you don't have to...

321
00:19:19,022 --> 00:19:20,822
worry about money at least.

322
00:19:21,462 --> 00:19:22,492
Gosh.

323
00:19:23,432 --> 00:19:25,462
Just the thought makes me so happy.

324
00:19:25,802 --> 00:19:27,202
I mean it, Kwang Sook.

325
00:19:27,732 --> 00:19:29,732
One sikhye and one grain drink, please.

326
00:19:29,732 --> 00:19:30,772
Okay.

327
00:19:31,732 --> 00:19:34,242
Kwang Sook, I have an urgent meeting.

328
00:19:34,242 --> 00:19:36,572
I'll call you again soon. Bye.

329
00:19:38,312 --> 00:19:40,242
- A sikhye and a grain drink? - Yes.

330
00:19:40,442 --> 00:19:41,542
What a great choice.

331
00:19:41,542 --> 00:19:43,912
Our dry sauna's signature drinks.

332
00:19:43,912 --> 00:19:45,512
Look forward to trying them.

(Loan Maturity Notice)

334
00:19:56,532 --> 00:19:58,492
It would be so nice...

335
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:01,562
if I didn't have to worry about money...

336
00:20:02,262 --> 00:20:03,632
even if I had other worries.

337
00:20:12,812 --> 00:20:14,042
Hi, Ok Bun.

338
00:20:18,482 --> 00:20:20,622
It's me, Kwang Sook.

339
00:20:21,882 --> 00:20:24,852
I just got off the phone with Heung Soo.

340
00:20:24,852 --> 00:20:25,862
Kwang Sook.

341
00:20:26,262 --> 00:20:27,692
Don't you dare mention...

342
00:20:28,292 --> 00:20:29,462
darn Oh Heung Soo...

343
00:20:30,492 --> 00:20:33,002
in front of me ever again.

344
00:20:33,902 --> 00:20:36,802
Why? Is something wrong?

345
00:20:36,932 --> 00:20:38,172
The fool...

346
00:20:38,902 --> 00:20:41,502
broke poor Ok Bun's heart...

347
00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:44,372
and disappeared.

348
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:49,152
It's really over.

349
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:53,652
How come? Ms. Kim's out of the picture now.

350
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:55,382
Couldn't you have made it work?

351
00:20:55,522 --> 00:20:58,352
I tried to make it work.

352
00:21:00,122 --> 00:21:01,122
But...

353
00:21:04,032 --> 00:21:07,862
I guess Heung Soo really doesn't like me.

354
00:21:12,842 --> 00:21:13,902
Ok Bun.

355
00:21:14,772 --> 00:21:16,142
Don't cry.

356
00:21:17,612 --> 00:21:18,872
Calm down.

357
00:21:24,382 --> 00:21:25,712
The thing is,

358
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:33,162
rather than hating Heung Soo,

359
00:21:35,022 --> 00:21:37,692
I hate myself much more...

360
00:21:39,962 --> 00:21:42,932
for not being able to win his love.

361
00:21:57,712 --> 00:21:59,182
What do you think...

362
00:22:00,022 --> 00:22:02,452
he dislikes about me so much?

363
00:22:04,922 --> 00:22:07,362
Why does he dislike me enough...

364
00:22:10,992 --> 00:22:14,232
that he had to run away from me?

365

(Hankuk University Hospital)

366
00:22:41,991 --> 00:22:44,201
Why are you back here?

367
00:22:44,431 --> 00:22:45,801
Out of concern.

368
00:22:45,801 --> 00:22:48,501
I told you it wasn't a serious operation.

369
00:22:49,271 --> 00:22:51,601
How isn't it serious when your stomach got cut open?

370
00:22:53,511 --> 00:22:56,811
You shouldn't be so nice to me.

371
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:01,281
The nicer you treat me,

372
00:23:02,151 --> 00:23:04,151
the more I want to lean on you.

373
00:23:07,451 --> 00:23:09,091
- You can lean on me. - What?

374
00:23:09,291 --> 00:23:10,491
I'll take it all.

375
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:13,761
Hey, I'm glad I got the surgery.

376
00:23:13,761 --> 00:23:16,101
I get to lean on you and grumble a bit.

377
00:23:18,631 --> 00:23:19,731
Shall I wash your hair?

378
00:23:20,001 --> 00:23:21,101
Out of the blue?

379
00:23:21,101 --> 00:23:23,741
Why? Does my hair look grimy?

380
00:23:23,741 --> 00:23:25,401
No, it's not that.

381
00:23:25,941 --> 00:23:27,471
In case you feel grimy.

382
00:23:28,511 --> 00:23:31,111
I go home tomorrow. I'll wash it at home.

383
00:23:31,581 --> 00:23:33,151
Is there anything you want to eat?

384
00:23:33,151 --> 00:23:35,081
Name it. I'll buy you anything.

385
00:23:35,281 --> 00:23:36,451
Do you want fried chicken?

386
00:23:37,021 --> 00:23:38,321
No.

387
00:23:38,721 --> 00:23:40,851
I can't have fried chicken...

388
00:23:40,851 --> 00:23:42,421
just hours after surgery.

389
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,461
Oh, right.

390
00:23:45,461 --> 00:23:48,231
You must be tired. Go home and rest.

391
00:23:48,631 --> 00:23:50,261
After you fall asleep.

392
00:23:50,261 --> 00:23:52,801
Don't be silly. Go home.

393
00:23:52,801 --> 00:23:54,831
I will once I see you've fallen asleep.

394
00:23:54,831 --> 00:23:56,541
Don't mind me and rest.

395
00:23:57,871 --> 00:23:59,141
Shall I sing a lullaby?

396
00:23:59,711 --> 00:24:01,071
No, don't. You can't.

397
00:24:01,071 --> 00:24:03,141
Sleep well

398
00:24:03,141 --> 00:24:05,141
- My dear Mi Sun - Please don't.

399
00:24:05,141 --> 00:24:06,381
Darn you.

400
00:24:07,651 --> 00:24:09,981
- It's so embarrassing. - In the garden

401
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:13,591
And hill in the back

402
00:24:13,591 --> 00:24:15,691
My stomach hurts. It really does. Stop.

403
00:24:15,691 --> 00:24:19,791
The baby and the trees

404
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:22,701
Chun Soo, please stop this.

405
00:24:22,701 --> 00:24:26,471
Sleep tight, my Mi Sun

406
00:24:26,471 --> 00:24:29,771
- My stomach hurts. - Oh, gosh. I'm sorry.

407
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:36,311
Ten days to go.

408
00:24:36,781 --> 00:24:40,381
I have a feeling these will be the longest ten days of my life.

409
00:24:41,711 --> 00:24:45,021
On the other hand, the wait will be exciting.

410
00:24:46,121 --> 00:24:48,821
Good night, CEO Ma.

411
00:25:08,711 --> 00:25:09,841
(Ten days to go.)

412
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,481
Good night, CEO Ma.

413
00:25:18,251 --> 00:25:19,391
Oh, boy.

414
00:25:34,931 --> 00:25:36,841
You're really taking care of your skin this morning.

415
00:25:36,841 --> 00:25:37,841
Are you going somewhere?

416
00:25:38,001 --> 00:25:39,511
I already told you.

417
00:25:39,571 --> 00:25:42,881
I was invited to the dance recital at Golden Castle today.

418
00:25:43,111 --> 00:25:45,311
Why would you go there? No one would welcome you.

419
00:25:45,511 --> 00:25:46,681
I'm only going...

420
00:25:46,681 --> 00:25:48,981
so those women don't get the satisfaction they want.

421
00:25:48,981 --> 00:25:52,751
And I, Gong Ju Sil, still have it.

422
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:54,291
I'm going there to show them that.

423
00:25:56,821 --> 00:25:58,021
You're a peculiar one.

424
00:25:58,261 --> 00:26:00,261
Anyway, take a seat. Let's eat breakfast.

425
00:26:07,371 --> 00:26:08,371
Hold on.

426
00:26:08,571 --> 00:26:10,601
Where's Chun Soo?

427
00:26:12,711 --> 00:26:13,741
Just a second.

428
00:26:19,051 --> 00:26:21,711
Let me borrow your brewery manager for a day.

429
00:26:22,521 --> 00:26:23,721
What for?

430
00:26:23,721 --> 00:26:25,121
Isn't it obvious?

431
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:27,691
I want to take him to Golden Castle today.

432
00:26:27,991 --> 00:26:31,561
I doubt Mr. Go would agree to go there.

433
00:26:32,061 --> 00:26:33,991
He already agreed to go.

434
00:26:35,461 --> 00:26:36,861
- Really? - Yes.

435
00:26:39,271 --> 00:26:40,431
Chun Soo's not in his room.

436
00:26:41,231 --> 00:26:42,301
What?

437
00:26:42,301 --> 00:26:44,041
Where did he go so early in the morning?

438
00:26:44,541 --> 00:26:46,111
I don't think he came home last night.

439
00:26:48,111 --> 00:26:49,711
- He stayed out all night? - He stayed out all night?

440
00:26:51,281 --> 00:26:52,311
Goodness.

441
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:54,751
I'm back.

442
00:26:58,321 --> 00:26:59,591
- Did you stay out all night? - Did you stay out all night?

443
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:01,091
What?

444
00:27:01,651 --> 00:27:03,161
It's not what you think.

445
00:27:04,221 --> 00:27:05,861
Mi Sun's in the hospital.

446
00:27:06,531 --> 00:27:09,261
Goodness. How so? Is it something serious?

447
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:10,761
It's nothing serious,

448
00:27:10,761 --> 00:27:12,101
but she had surgery yesterday to repair her hernia.

449
00:27:12,101 --> 00:27:13,331
I stayed by her bedside.

450
00:27:14,171 --> 00:27:16,101
I was going to call you, but it was late into the night,

451
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:17,801
so I didn't. I'm sorry.

452
00:27:22,911 --> 00:27:23,981
Come on.

453
00:27:24,081 --> 00:27:26,451
- Let's have breakfast. - Sure.

454
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:27,911
Goodness.

455
00:27:29,751 --> 00:27:30,821
This looks good.

456
00:27:59,481 --> 00:28:00,881
A day feels too long.

457
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:17,631
Darn.

458
00:28:24,871 --> 00:28:25,871
Shoot.

459
00:28:26,241 --> 00:28:27,241
You startled me.

460
00:28:28,911 --> 00:28:32,551
Can you be gentle with the door? The noise makes my head ring.

461
00:28:33,081 --> 00:28:34,681
What's that punk's name?

462
00:28:35,481 --> 00:28:36,521
Which punk?

463
00:28:36,521 --> 00:28:38,081
Who else would I be talking about?

464
00:28:38,081 --> 00:28:39,821
That darn professor Se Ri fell for.

465
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:44,921
Why do you want to know his name?

466
00:28:45,191 --> 00:28:48,531
I should break his legs, whoever he is.

467
00:28:48,591 --> 00:28:51,261
How dare he seduce and date an innocent student?

468
00:28:51,261 --> 00:28:53,131
How many times do I have to repeat myself?

469
00:28:54,431 --> 00:28:58,071
That professor isn't interested in Se Ri at all.

470
00:28:58,101 --> 00:29:00,341
She's the only one with a crush on him.

471
00:29:00,441 --> 00:29:03,241
It takes two to tango.

472
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:05,381
The professor probably enticed her in some way.

473
00:29:05,381 --> 00:29:06,951
How else could she have fallen for him?

474
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:08,711
It's not like that, honey.

475
00:29:08,711 --> 00:29:10,821
Se Ri has been the one making all the moves.

476
00:29:10,821 --> 00:29:13,921
That professor didn't even bat an eye.

477
00:29:15,521 --> 00:29:17,591
- Is that true? - Yes.

478
00:29:17,761 --> 00:29:20,491
I confirmed everything myself.

479
00:29:24,301 --> 00:29:28,201
Where did she get her poor taste in men from?

480
00:29:29,571 --> 00:29:33,441
Who else could it be but her mom?

481
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:34,611
What?

482
00:29:34,871 --> 00:29:38,911
Enough with the yelling! I told you my head was ringing.

483
00:29:40,451 --> 00:29:42,111
My head.

484
00:29:42,851 --> 00:29:43,881
What about my food?

485
00:29:45,181 --> 00:29:47,251
Your food?

486
00:29:47,851 --> 00:29:50,891
How could you even ask me for food at a time like this?

487
00:29:51,721 --> 00:29:54,031
Gosh, my head.

488
00:29:54,661 --> 00:29:57,201
My head. It's killing me.

489
00:30:04,971 --> 00:30:06,971
I know you adore Ha Ni...

490
00:30:07,041 --> 00:30:08,871
and care about me.

491
00:30:09,481 --> 00:30:11,041
I know how you feel, and I appreciate it.

492
00:30:11,681 --> 00:30:12,681
But...

493
00:30:13,581 --> 00:30:14,681
in the world we live in,

494
00:30:14,681 --> 00:30:16,681
there's such a thing as common sense and culture.

495
00:30:20,851 --> 00:30:23,221
But none of that matters to me.

496
00:30:32,431 --> 00:30:34,671
- Hello. - How can I help you?

497
00:30:34,671 --> 00:30:37,441
I called earlier to ask about rental units.

498
00:30:37,541 --> 00:30:38,571
Please have a seat.

499
00:30:40,841 --> 00:30:44,281
Aren't you a sweetheart? My goodness.

500
00:30:44,811 --> 00:30:47,111
Who gave you that adorable face?

501
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:48,511
Hi, there.

502
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,351
There are a variety of rental units,

503
00:30:51,821 --> 00:30:54,791
so let me recommend one with natural light and good airflow.

504
00:30:54,991 --> 00:30:57,961
A south-facing unit would be ideal for the baby.

505
00:30:58,221 --> 00:30:59,221
Thank you.

506
00:30:59,761 --> 00:31:02,901
Just a second. Let me see.

507
00:31:08,431 --> 00:31:09,771
What brings you to the office?

508
00:31:12,141 --> 00:31:13,171
Thanks.

509
00:31:17,181 --> 00:31:20,781
My dad wanted to treat us to a meal to celebrate our new jobs.

510
00:31:20,911 --> 00:31:23,651
He invited us as well as Gyeol. What do you say?

511
00:31:24,821 --> 00:31:25,921
I'd be grateful.

512
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:28,691
How's your brother doing?

513
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:31,291
Things haven't been that great for him.

514
00:31:32,291 --> 00:31:34,691
Why's that? Did something happen?

515
00:31:35,391 --> 00:31:37,931
He was going to get married in September,

516
00:31:37,931 --> 00:31:39,101
but the wedding was called off.

517
00:31:40,131 --> 00:31:41,201
Why?

518
00:31:42,201 --> 00:31:44,871
His fiancee has feelings for someone else.

519
00:31:44,941 --> 00:31:45,971
What?

520
00:31:46,411 --> 00:31:48,541
You'd be even more surprised to hear who his fiancee was.

521
00:31:52,111 --> 00:31:53,111
It was Se Ri.

522
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:54,311
What?

523
00:31:55,081 --> 00:31:58,521
Se Ri was going to marry Mr. Han?

524
00:32:15,971 --> 00:32:18,071
My son and daughter left for work,

525
00:32:18,341 --> 00:32:21,341
and the housekeeper went out as well.

526
00:32:21,511 --> 00:32:23,041
I have the house to myself.

527
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:25,841
I know I'm supposed to text you once a day,

528
00:32:26,041 --> 00:32:27,851
but you were on my mind so much.

529
00:32:27,911 --> 00:32:30,051
I had to text you earlier than usual today.

530
00:32:37,261 --> 00:32:41,131
I believed that a routine life gave me structure,

531
00:32:42,061 --> 00:32:43,561
but since I met you,

532
00:32:44,131 --> 00:32:46,971
I've realized how dull my life...

533
00:32:46,971 --> 00:32:48,331
really was.

534
00:32:51,101 --> 00:32:52,141
Having coffee,

535
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:54,941
reading newspapers,

536
00:32:56,111 --> 00:32:57,141
and playing Go.

537
00:32:57,311 --> 00:33:00,081
The timing of the pass was perfect, and he charged magnificently.

538
00:33:00,081 --> 00:33:01,711
- Unbelievable. - Watching soccer...

539
00:33:02,451 --> 00:33:04,081
and even taking naps.

540
00:33:05,881 --> 00:33:08,721
I'd love to enjoy all of that with you, CEO Ma.

541
00:33:09,021 --> 00:33:10,991
He must be bored by himself.

542
00:33:14,691 --> 00:33:16,361
(The 8th Golden Castle Dance Team Recital)

543
00:33:17,531 --> 00:33:19,261
- Here. - Goodness.

544
00:33:19,631 --> 00:33:20,631
Amazing.

545
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:39,691
(The 8th Golden Castle Dance Team Recital)

546
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,171
Who's that man holding her hand?

547
00:34:02,771 --> 00:34:04,211
Could he be her boyfriend?

548
00:34:04,241 --> 00:34:06,481
That's absurd. He's obviously younger than her.

549
00:34:07,051 --> 00:34:08,081
Goodness me.

550
00:34:09,521 --> 00:34:10,951
Ms. Gong, you made it.

551
00:34:11,621 --> 00:34:12,681
Welcome.

552
00:34:12,681 --> 00:34:14,391
It's been a while, doctors.

553
00:34:14,691 --> 00:34:17,821
Thank you for inviting me to this special recital.

554
00:34:17,821 --> 00:34:21,131
We got on the stage with you last year.

555
00:34:21,131 --> 00:34:22,661
It's a shame we couldn't this year.

556
00:34:23,701 --> 00:34:25,901
By the way, who is he?

557
00:34:27,901 --> 00:34:31,271
Oh, right. He's my boyfriend.

558
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:33,771
- What? - My gosh.

559
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:39,511
Mr. Go, please introduce yourself.

560
00:34:41,811 --> 00:34:44,921
Hello. I'm Auto Go.

561
00:34:45,081 --> 00:34:46,551
- Auto? - Auto?

562
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:48,921
- Auto? - Auto Go?

563
00:34:50,861 --> 00:34:52,491
I'm Go Ja Dong.

564
00:34:54,331 --> 00:34:55,661
I see. Nice to meet you.

565
00:34:56,161 --> 00:34:59,831
By the way, you look younger than her.

566
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:01,371
We're not that many years apart.

567
00:35:01,371 --> 00:35:04,601
I'm five years younger than Mrs. Gong.

568
00:35:05,871 --> 00:35:07,771
He's five years younger than her.

569
00:35:07,771 --> 00:35:09,841
Gosh, I'm so jealous.

570
00:35:19,281 --> 00:35:20,521
It's been a while.

571
00:35:20,521 --> 00:35:21,651
Since I last saw you,

572
00:35:23,691 --> 00:35:25,061
you've become uglier.

573
00:35:25,061 --> 00:35:26,931
What are you saying?

574
00:35:27,191 --> 00:35:30,201
How dare you bring a man who's a lot younger than you here?

575
00:35:30,201 --> 00:35:32,061
Shame on you.

576
00:35:32,831 --> 00:35:36,201
If you're jealous, just be honest and say so.

577
00:35:36,541 --> 00:35:37,541
Okay?

578
00:35:39,071 --> 00:35:40,341
Mrs. Gong.

579
00:35:40,811 --> 00:35:41,971
Please have a seat.

580
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:45,111
Thank you, Mr. Go.

581
00:35:49,511 --> 00:35:51,551
- My goodness. - Oh, dear.

582
00:35:52,021 --> 00:35:55,691
(The 8th Golden Castle Dance Team Recital)

583
00:36:01,561 --> 00:36:04,161
I was excited to come to the best retirement home,

584
00:36:04,161 --> 00:36:05,861
but this falls far short of my expectations.

585
00:36:06,001 --> 00:36:07,031
I know.

586
00:36:07,301 --> 00:36:09,131
It's not like they're dancing in a tour bus,

587
00:36:09,131 --> 00:36:10,801
but this is so lame.

588
00:36:13,211 --> 00:36:14,211
I'm sleepy.

589
00:36:15,141 --> 00:36:16,441
I need to chew some gum.

590
00:36:19,281 --> 00:36:20,281
My goodness.

591
00:36:30,991 --> 00:36:32,191
Mr. Go.

592
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:34,431
It seems like...

593
00:36:35,431 --> 00:36:36,761
you used to dance.

594
00:36:38,431 --> 00:36:39,901
When I served in the military,

595
00:36:39,901 --> 00:36:42,701
my senior was a famous dance instructor,

596
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:44,301
so I learned the basic moves.

597
00:36:44,301 --> 00:36:45,301
I see.

598
00:37:59,751 --> 00:38:02,281
- Bravo! - That was amazing!

599
00:38:02,281 --> 00:38:04,121
- That was beautiful. - You're the best.

600
00:38:08,421 --> 00:38:09,651
You're the best.

601
00:38:13,991 --> 00:38:15,191
Bravo!

602
00:38:16,091 --> 00:38:17,101
Bravo!

603
00:38:22,971 --> 00:38:24,371
How impressive.

604
00:38:27,861 --> 00:38:31,231
By the way, did you really quit the Zumba dance class?

605
00:38:31,291 --> 00:38:34,601
The new instructor is really handsome...

606
00:38:34,601 --> 00:38:36,431
and has a good figure.

607
00:38:37,201 --> 00:38:39,001
You have no sense of loyalty.

608
00:38:39,201 --> 00:38:40,201
When we had Mr. Oh,

609
00:38:40,201 --> 00:38:42,341
you said he was the best.

610
00:38:43,641 --> 00:38:44,871
To be honest,

611
00:38:44,871 --> 00:38:47,711
Mr. Oh wasn't that good-looking. He was just a good talker.

612
00:38:48,641 --> 00:38:49,681
What?

613
00:38:49,681 --> 00:38:52,251
Why is he a good talker without good looks?

614
00:38:52,881 --> 00:38:55,251
His facial features are perfect.

615
00:38:55,251 --> 00:38:56,951
Perfect, my foot.

616
00:38:57,491 --> 00:38:59,461
Oh, right. I hear...

617
00:38:59,461 --> 00:39:02,391
Mr. Oh is working at a sauna cafeteria.

618
00:39:04,661 --> 00:39:05,761
What are you talking about?

619
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:08,831
Na Young's mom saw him at a sauna in Hongje-dong.

620
00:39:09,431 --> 00:39:10,871
Mr. Oh was selling...

621
00:39:10,871 --> 00:39:13,971
stuff like baked eggs and grain drinks at the sauna.

622
00:39:15,201 --> 00:39:16,211
What?

623
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:26,881
All right. Here's the draft beer you ordered.

624
00:39:27,581 --> 00:39:28,681
I'll take this.

625
00:39:31,321 --> 00:39:34,621
Darn it. This is lukewarm!

626
00:39:35,221 --> 00:39:36,291
That can't be true.

627
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:38,991
If a customer says it's lukewarm, it's lukewarm.

628
00:39:39,701 --> 00:39:40,731
I see.

629
00:39:41,401 --> 00:39:43,871
You've been drinking since this morning,

630
00:39:43,871 --> 00:39:45,401
so you're a little drunk.

631
00:39:46,271 --> 00:39:48,371
Who are you to criticize me?

632
00:39:48,601 --> 00:39:51,141
I'm not drunk. I'm completely sober.

633
00:39:52,071 --> 00:39:53,981
Sure. I get that.

634
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:55,511
Since you think it's lukewarm,

635
00:39:55,511 --> 00:39:57,711
this one is on the house.

636
00:39:58,451 --> 00:40:01,021
Who are you to tell me I should pay or not?

637
00:40:01,021 --> 00:40:02,851
Are you the owner of this sauna?

638
00:40:08,521 --> 00:40:10,431
What do you think you're doing?

639
00:40:11,431 --> 00:40:12,561
Mister!

640
00:40:12,901 --> 00:40:13,901
What?

641
00:40:14,261 --> 00:40:15,501
Hey, Ok Bun.

642
00:40:17,771 --> 00:40:20,571
If you're drunk, go into the room and sleep.

643
00:40:22,001 --> 00:40:24,111
How dare you act nasty out of drunkenness?

644
00:40:25,911 --> 00:40:27,511
My goodness.

645
00:40:27,781 --> 00:40:29,141
Why are you being like this?

646
00:40:49,201 --> 00:40:51,201
I shouldn't be away from the cafeteria for too long.

647
00:40:51,301 --> 00:40:52,771
I have to go back to the sauna.

648
00:40:53,771 --> 00:40:55,541
We're here.

649
00:40:57,211 --> 00:40:58,211
What?

650
00:41:02,311 --> 00:41:03,881
- My goodness. Mr. Oh! - What...

651
00:41:03,881 --> 00:41:05,951
It's been so long.

652
00:41:06,521 --> 00:41:08,081
What are you doing here?

653
00:41:08,081 --> 00:41:11,491
I changed my business from tteokbokki to toast.

654
00:41:12,791 --> 00:41:15,621
We will have the signature menu for two.

655
00:41:15,621 --> 00:41:17,031
Sure. Please have a seat.

656
00:41:17,031 --> 00:41:18,691
I'll make it delicious for you.

657
00:41:18,691 --> 00:41:20,161
I bet it will be tasty.

658
00:41:32,271 --> 00:41:33,941
What do you think of the toast?

659
00:41:34,041 --> 00:41:35,141
My goodness.

660
00:41:36,111 --> 00:41:37,811
It tastes so clean and savory.

661
00:41:38,681 --> 00:41:39,921
My gosh.

662
00:41:42,221 --> 00:41:43,651
Do you want to run a store like this?

663
00:41:44,321 --> 00:41:45,391
Who?

664
00:41:48,961 --> 00:41:49,961
Me?

665
00:41:51,531 --> 00:41:53,031
I will invest,

666
00:41:53,301 --> 00:41:54,661
and you'll run the business.

667
00:41:55,831 --> 00:41:56,831
What do you say?

668
00:42:04,511 --> 00:42:05,641
Do you want...

669
00:42:06,611 --> 00:42:08,011
to invest in me?

670
00:42:12,051 --> 00:42:13,381
Hey, Sa Man.

671
00:42:14,151 --> 00:42:16,181
I'm calling you to tell you good news.

672
00:42:16,891 --> 00:42:18,051
What good news?

673
00:42:19,151 --> 00:42:21,521
I had a meeting with my company staff.

674
00:42:21,891 --> 00:42:24,461
Among the staff in charge of liquor, there is an employee...

675
00:42:24,461 --> 00:42:26,461
who tried Jang-Kwang Makgeolli during the business trip to Korea.

676
00:42:26,531 --> 00:42:27,531
Really?

677
00:42:27,531 --> 00:42:30,071
He also liked the taste of Jang-Kwang Makgeolli,

678
00:42:30,071 --> 00:42:31,801
so he was thinking...

679
00:42:31,801 --> 00:42:33,371
about contacting Eagle Brewery.

680
00:42:34,041 --> 00:42:35,101
That's great.

681
00:42:35,401 --> 00:42:36,541
My goodness.

682
00:42:36,811 --> 00:42:39,341
CEO Ma would be excited to hear that.

683
00:42:39,341 --> 00:42:42,481
I gained something unexpected on this business trip thanks to you.

684
00:42:42,581 --> 00:42:45,351
I'll start the import process as soon as I get back.

685
00:42:46,181 --> 00:42:48,821
I'll tell her to be on standby.

686
00:42:48,921 --> 00:42:50,651
Actually, I moved up my flight...

687
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:52,351
because of this matter.

688
00:42:52,451 --> 00:42:54,521
I'll come to your office tomorrow to say goodbye.

689
00:42:54,691 --> 00:42:57,461
Can I get some of the yakju at your hotel?

690
00:42:57,861 --> 00:42:59,231
I want to bring a few bottles of the yakju...

691
00:42:59,231 --> 00:43:01,131
and try it with my employees.

692
00:43:01,631 --> 00:43:03,971
Of course. I can do that.

693
00:43:04,301 --> 00:43:06,641
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow then.

694
00:43:11,271 --> 00:43:14,541
She agreed that we could text each other once a day.

695
00:43:14,541 --> 00:43:15,611
But...

696
00:43:16,681 --> 00:43:19,921
this is definitely an exception.

697
00:43:27,691 --> 00:43:29,061
Kwang Sook.

698
00:43:30,231 --> 00:43:33,001
Leave it. I'll wipe them down with Kim tomorrow.

699
00:43:34,661 --> 00:43:36,671
I was doing it in my free time.

700
00:43:40,041 --> 00:43:42,141
Are you going somewhere?

701
00:43:43,011 --> 00:43:45,841
I'm going to help Mi Sun get discharged and get home.

702
00:43:46,611 --> 00:43:49,811
How about you pluck up the courage today?

703
00:43:50,651 --> 00:43:51,711
What?

704
00:43:53,721 --> 00:43:56,521
You both took a long detour.

705
00:43:57,521 --> 00:43:59,421
It's time to go straight ahead.

706
00:44:01,591 --> 00:44:02,621
Oh, well...

707
00:44:06,291 --> 00:44:08,201
Don't go back. It's a one-way street.

708
00:44:09,201 --> 00:44:10,201
Okay?

709
00:44:13,271 --> 00:44:15,071
Why won't you answer?

710
00:44:15,241 --> 00:44:16,911
Don't go back. It's a one-way street.

711
00:44:17,811 --> 00:44:18,841
Okay?

712
00:44:26,651 --> 00:44:27,651
Okay.

713
00:44:46,201 --> 00:44:47,301
Gosh.

714
00:44:50,471 --> 00:44:52,071
- Put these on. - Okay.

715
00:44:53,011 --> 00:44:55,811
I can rest in my bedroom.

716
00:44:55,811 --> 00:44:57,111
Don't worry about me and go home.

717
00:44:58,311 --> 00:44:59,651
You want me to leave already?

718
00:45:01,151 --> 00:45:03,421
Don't offer to stand guard while I fall asleep...

719
00:45:03,421 --> 00:45:05,551
and doze off first like last night.

720
00:45:06,491 --> 00:45:09,391
Today, you should go home and rest.

721
00:45:11,191 --> 00:45:13,361
- Mi Sun. - Yes?

722
00:45:14,661 --> 00:45:17,831
Let's stay close, look after each other,

723
00:45:19,841 --> 00:45:21,171
and grow old together.

724
00:45:21,901 --> 00:45:23,811
Yes. We should do just that.

725
00:45:29,011 --> 00:45:30,011
Wait.

726
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:32,711
What exactly...

727
00:45:34,751 --> 00:45:36,351
do you mean by that?

728
00:45:37,451 --> 00:45:40,191
I was going to ask after the legal stuff was done.

729
00:45:41,391 --> 00:45:43,091
I'm sorry I messed up the order.

730
00:45:46,361 --> 00:45:47,361
I want...

731
00:45:49,871 --> 00:45:50,931
to start over...

732
00:45:53,171 --> 00:45:54,371
with you.

733
00:45:56,141 --> 00:45:57,411
What do you think?

734
00:46:02,681 --> 00:46:04,251
Was that too sudden?

735
00:46:05,051 --> 00:46:06,851
Well...

736
00:46:07,051 --> 00:46:08,681
It was sudden, but...

737
00:46:11,651 --> 00:46:12,791
Actually...

738
00:46:13,661 --> 00:46:14,861
Actually,

739
00:46:16,191 --> 00:46:18,461
I'd been thinking the same thing.

740
00:46:19,431 --> 00:46:20,901
But it feels weird...

741
00:46:21,861 --> 00:46:23,171
to actually hear you say that.

742
00:46:26,031 --> 00:46:27,541
Thanks a lot...

743
00:46:29,101 --> 00:46:30,171
for saying it first.

744
00:46:34,611 --> 00:46:36,981
If you were going to mess up the order,

745
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:39,181
you should've asked sooner.

746
00:46:40,951 --> 00:46:42,021
What?

747
00:46:42,121 --> 00:46:45,091
When we were younger, before you got married.

748
00:46:46,821 --> 00:46:47,821
Oh, well...

749
00:46:48,291 --> 00:46:50,591
We were such good friends then.

750
00:46:52,861 --> 00:46:54,501
I was too cautious.

751
00:46:55,531 --> 00:46:58,031
Yes. That's Oh Chun Soo.

752
00:47:01,271 --> 00:47:03,641
I thought I'd lost a lot in life.

753
00:47:04,341 --> 00:47:05,341
But...

754
00:47:06,881 --> 00:47:08,911
I got you back.

755
00:47:11,081 --> 00:47:12,251
I'm really glad.

756
00:47:22,491 --> 00:47:25,161
It took a lot of work to get you to propose.

757
00:47:26,231 --> 00:47:28,601
I won't lose you again.

758
00:47:33,471 --> 00:47:34,541
Thank you...

759
00:47:35,671 --> 00:47:36,871
for saying yes.

760
00:48:13,581 --> 00:48:14,941
(LX Hotel Chairman Han Dong Seok)

761
00:48:21,281 --> 00:48:22,351
What's this?

762
00:48:22,381 --> 00:48:24,821
We agreed to text just once a day.

763
00:48:33,901 --> 00:48:35,001
Hello?

764
00:48:35,531 --> 00:48:36,561
Where are you?

765
00:48:38,001 --> 00:48:39,171
I'm at home.

766
00:48:40,441 --> 00:48:42,941
Meet me outside the brewery. I'm waiting for you.

767
00:48:46,141 --> 00:48:47,141
Wait.

768
00:48:47,541 --> 00:48:50,251
You can't go against your word on day one.

769
00:48:50,951 --> 00:48:52,781
I need time to think.

770
00:48:53,251 --> 00:48:56,851
Something urgent came up and every second counts.

771
00:48:57,051 --> 00:48:58,651
I had no choice but to come here.

772
00:48:58,691 --> 00:49:00,921
I'm not here because I want to be.

773
00:49:04,061 --> 00:49:05,131
Chairman Han.

774
00:49:08,231 --> 00:49:10,871
What's so urgent that every second counts?

775
00:49:11,501 --> 00:49:12,631
What happened?

776
00:49:12,901 --> 00:49:15,641
The Saman Mart CEO you met yesterday.

777
00:49:16,241 --> 00:49:17,271
Yes.

778
00:49:17,671 --> 00:49:19,511
He just called.

779
00:49:19,941 --> 00:49:22,581
He discussed with his team in the US.

780
00:49:25,251 --> 00:49:26,411
They like your product.

781
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:30,121
He'll take a few bottles of Jang-Kwang Yakju tomorrow...

782
00:49:30,121 --> 00:49:31,751
to taste it with his team.

783
00:49:31,921 --> 00:49:35,161
If there are no serious objections, they'll start the import process.

784
00:49:36,091 --> 00:49:37,161
They will?

785
00:49:37,331 --> 00:49:39,561
I broke the rules coming here...

786
00:49:39,591 --> 00:49:41,601
to give you the good news and grab a few bottles...

787
00:49:41,601 --> 00:49:43,431
of Jang-Kwang Yakju for my friend.

788
00:49:44,671 --> 00:49:45,931
Wasn't it worth it?

789
00:49:48,041 --> 00:49:49,041
It was.

790
00:49:49,171 --> 00:49:50,211
Okay.

791
00:49:52,871 --> 00:49:54,081
What were you doing?

792
00:49:54,481 --> 00:49:56,181
I was hungry and about to cook some ramyeon.

793
00:49:56,211 --> 00:49:58,411
I rushed over when I got your call.

794
00:49:58,611 --> 00:50:00,281
I haven't had lunch either.

795
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:03,021
Why did you skip lunch?

796
00:50:03,221 --> 00:50:05,491
I told you. Both the kids went to work...

797
00:50:05,491 --> 00:50:07,391
and my helper was out too.

798
00:50:08,261 --> 00:50:10,131
You should've had some ramyeon.

799
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:12,591
Wait.

800
00:50:13,701 --> 00:50:16,101
You can't even cook ramyeon?

801
00:50:17,501 --> 00:50:19,171
Do I lose points for that?

802
00:50:20,441 --> 00:50:21,501
What?

803
00:50:22,101 --> 00:50:25,571
If you'll deduct points for that, I won't answer.

804
00:50:28,741 --> 00:50:31,381
You promised not to talk about things like that for a while.

805
00:50:35,921 --> 00:50:38,191
If you're cooking ramyeon, make an extra portion.

806
00:50:38,291 --> 00:50:40,091
I'd like to have some.

807
00:50:43,121 --> 00:50:46,261
You'll have ramyeon at my place?

808
00:50:46,491 --> 00:50:49,731
I asked my friend if he'd be willing to import your product...

809
00:50:49,961 --> 00:50:52,101
and drove myself here on a weekend to get some yakju...

810
00:50:52,101 --> 00:50:53,601
so he can take it back...

811
00:50:53,741 --> 00:50:55,071
to the US tomorrow.

812
00:50:55,071 --> 00:50:56,941
Okay. Fine.

813
00:51:09,151 --> 00:51:11,351
The rest of the family must be out.

814
00:51:12,451 --> 00:51:16,091
Yes. My mom's attending a recital,

815
00:51:16,321 --> 00:51:19,591
and my eldest brother-in-law is visiting a sick friend.

816
00:51:20,161 --> 00:51:22,661
The youngest is at work.

817
00:51:27,201 --> 00:51:29,271
Come this way.

818
00:51:43,351 --> 00:51:46,721
Are you a good cook?

819
00:51:49,191 --> 00:51:50,291
I suck at it.

820
00:51:51,061 --> 00:51:54,431
I'm best at cooking ramyeon.

821
00:51:56,731 --> 00:51:58,831
The helper who does all the housework...

822
00:51:58,831 --> 00:52:01,171
is such a great cook.

823
00:52:01,571 --> 00:52:04,041
You won't lose any points for that.

824
00:52:05,741 --> 00:52:07,711
I'd rather lose points.

825
00:52:14,121 --> 00:52:15,751
I never imagined...

826
00:52:15,951 --> 00:52:18,121
you'd be that great...

827
00:52:18,321 --> 00:52:19,821
at dancing the tango.

828
00:52:20,991 --> 00:52:23,731
I did poorly because it had been a while.

829
00:52:23,731 --> 00:52:26,901
I'm grateful for your praise, Mrs. Gong.

830
00:52:28,301 --> 00:52:30,431
Thanks to you, my self-esteem...

831
00:52:30,931 --> 00:52:34,341
that had hit rock bottom soared today.

832
00:52:34,871 --> 00:52:37,911
I bet the Golden Castle women won't get any sleep tonight.

833
00:52:38,011 --> 00:52:40,281
They'll be so jealous and annoyed.

834
00:52:41,981 --> 00:52:45,611
Why don't we take dancing classes...

835
00:52:48,081 --> 00:52:49,181
together?

836
00:52:52,391 --> 00:52:53,661
I don't think...

837
00:52:54,191 --> 00:52:55,791
I can do that.

838
00:52:58,091 --> 00:52:59,131
Why not?

839
00:53:00,431 --> 00:53:02,331
Once the brewery closes down,

840
00:53:02,761 --> 00:53:04,631
I plan to move away and become a farmer.

841
00:53:04,871 --> 00:53:06,571
No. That can't happen.

842
00:53:07,171 --> 00:53:08,871
Why can't it happen?

843
00:53:09,641 --> 00:53:10,641
What?

844
00:53:11,811 --> 00:53:12,911
I mean...

845
00:53:13,641 --> 00:53:15,481
the brewery can't close down.

846
00:53:16,611 --> 00:53:18,011
But... Well,

847
00:53:18,751 --> 00:53:20,781
the bank has been pressuring us...

848
00:53:20,781 --> 00:53:22,281
to repay the loan,

849
00:53:22,281 --> 00:53:24,221
and no one wants to buy our product anymore.

850
00:53:24,691 --> 00:53:26,891
I think we're done for good this time.

851
00:53:48,311 --> 00:53:49,811
Would you like some more?

852
00:53:51,911 --> 00:53:52,911
Sure.

853
00:54:03,491 --> 00:54:04,491
Thank you.

854
00:54:09,161 --> 00:54:10,571
So what if you're wealthy?

855
00:54:11,271 --> 00:54:13,031
You can't even cook ramyeon...

856
00:54:13,031 --> 00:54:14,471
and have been starving all day.

857
00:54:17,641 --> 00:54:19,711
Do you feel bad for me?

858
00:54:22,411 --> 00:54:23,511
A little.

859
00:54:24,681 --> 00:54:28,521
Then, let's move up the deadline by a week.

860
00:54:31,021 --> 00:54:32,251
Not that stuff again.

861
00:54:34,321 --> 00:54:36,561
Kwang Sook?

862
00:54:37,261 --> 00:54:38,691
That must be my mom.

863
00:54:39,661 --> 00:54:41,331
I should officially greet her.

864
00:54:41,331 --> 00:54:43,501
No, you can't. That's absurd.

865
00:54:44,101 --> 00:54:45,171
What's absurd?

866
00:54:45,171 --> 00:54:47,141
You know what my mom is like.

867
00:54:47,641 --> 00:54:49,941
If she finds out that just the two of us...

868
00:54:49,941 --> 00:54:51,871
had ramyeon together,

869
00:54:52,111 --> 00:54:53,741
things could get complicated.

870
00:54:54,241 --> 00:54:56,741
So, what do you suggest we do?

871
00:54:56,741 --> 00:54:58,181
Hide.

872
00:54:59,081 --> 00:55:00,251
Hold on.

873
00:55:00,251 --> 00:55:02,621
Why should I hide when I've done nothing wrong?

874
00:55:02,621 --> 00:55:04,051
There's no time for this. Hurry.

875
00:55:04,051 --> 00:55:05,151
This way.

876
00:55:05,151 --> 00:55:06,191
- But... - Wait.

877
00:55:06,191 --> 00:55:07,491
Down here.

878
00:55:08,961 --> 00:55:10,491
Please wait here a second.

879
00:55:10,761 --> 00:55:11,891
Hang tight.

880
00:55:13,931 --> 00:55:16,431
Why should I have to hide when I've done nothing...

881
00:55:16,431 --> 00:55:17,801
wrong?

882
00:55:18,401 --> 00:55:19,671
Ma Kwang Sook.

883
00:55:19,931 --> 00:55:21,071
Where is she?

884
00:55:21,071 --> 00:55:24,011
Hey, how was the recital?

885
00:55:24,141 --> 00:55:26,411
That's not important right now.

886
00:55:26,771 --> 00:55:28,481
Is the brewery closing?

887
00:55:29,181 --> 00:55:31,211
What are you trying to say suddenly?

888
00:55:31,211 --> 00:55:32,881
It can't close.

889
00:55:33,081 --> 00:55:35,251
You must keep it open at all costs.

890
00:55:35,821 --> 00:55:38,521
Didn't you once beg me to shut down the brewery?

891
00:55:39,091 --> 00:55:40,391
What has gotten into you?

892
00:55:40,461 --> 00:55:42,961
You can close it someday,

893
00:55:43,121 --> 00:55:45,991
but not right now. No way.

894
00:55:46,091 --> 00:55:48,861
That can't happen. Bear that in mind. You can't.

895
00:56:04,211 --> 00:56:05,311
Kwang Sook.

896
00:56:06,811 --> 00:56:07,821
Yes?

897
00:56:11,751 --> 00:56:13,051
Was someone here?

898
00:56:13,591 --> 00:56:14,591
What?

899
00:56:15,221 --> 00:56:16,421
Why do you ask?

900
00:56:19,461 --> 00:56:21,401
There are two bowls of ramyeon.

901
00:56:23,431 --> 00:56:24,471
Right.

902
00:56:25,431 --> 00:56:27,871
Oh, that?

903
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:32,241
I was hungry, so I cooked a packet for myself...

904
00:56:32,541 --> 00:56:34,081
then ended up making another.

905
00:56:41,221 --> 00:56:42,751
Whatever.

906
00:56:43,321 --> 00:56:45,321
Just know that the brewery can't shut down.

907
00:56:45,491 --> 00:56:47,921
Protect it at all costs.

908
00:56:47,921 --> 00:56:49,091
Don't forget that.

909
00:56:58,631 --> 00:56:59,631
Chairman Han.

910
00:57:14,151 --> 00:57:15,881
You couldn't even finish your ramyeon.

911
00:57:16,221 --> 00:57:17,751
I bet you were startled.

912
00:57:18,851 --> 00:57:20,151
I'll need to stop by a pharmacy...

913
00:57:20,151 --> 00:57:21,861
for indigestion medicine.

914
00:57:21,861 --> 00:57:23,321
I feel like I have indigestion.

915
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:26,331
I'm so sorry about this.

916
00:57:27,461 --> 00:57:28,561
I'll get going.

917
00:57:32,231 --> 00:57:34,301
Still, I enjoyed our unexpected date today.

918
00:57:36,771 --> 00:57:37,771
I'm getting hot.

919
00:57:53,991 --> 00:57:55,691
Hey, Beom Soo.

920
00:57:59,391 --> 00:58:01,761
When you first took over the brewery,

921
00:58:02,101 --> 00:58:04,271
I had just returned from the US...

922
00:58:04,271 --> 00:58:05,571
and wasn't able to help.

923
00:58:07,101 --> 00:58:09,501
I hope you don't misunderstand what I'm about to say.

924
00:58:12,171 --> 00:58:13,811
I checked with a realtor,

925
00:58:13,811 --> 00:58:15,511
and I'll be able to move out...

926
00:58:15,511 --> 00:58:16,941
before the brewery loan matures,

927
00:58:17,451 --> 00:58:19,381
which is what I'm going to do.

928
00:58:19,551 --> 00:58:21,481
I can give you the deposit.

929
00:58:22,751 --> 00:58:24,421
What?

930
00:58:24,621 --> 00:58:27,121
But you have Ha Ni to care for.

931
00:58:27,191 --> 00:58:28,861
I'm moving to a place where I can pay rent monthly.

932
00:58:28,961 --> 00:58:31,961
That's ridiculous. Please don't do this, Beom Soo.

933
00:58:32,231 --> 00:58:35,061
We brothers only received help from Jang Soo.

934
00:58:36,001 --> 00:58:38,131
I'll only feel at ease if I can repay his kindness...

935
00:58:38,131 --> 00:58:39,301
in some way.

936
00:58:40,131 --> 00:58:41,141
Also,

937
00:58:42,141 --> 00:58:43,801
you need to protect the brewery.

938
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:50,081
I can't cause you brothers any burden.

939
00:58:53,581 --> 00:58:55,251
- Hello, Ms. Gong. - Hi.

940
00:58:55,621 --> 00:58:56,781
Professor Oh,

941
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:58,651
you should move in.

942
00:58:59,821 --> 00:59:00,821
Sorry?

943
00:59:01,621 --> 00:59:03,561
That way, you can accept the money.

944
00:59:03,661 --> 00:59:05,191
You can keep the brewery open.

945
00:59:07,131 --> 00:59:08,161
What?

946
00:59:08,631 --> 00:59:10,501
Okay, then. End of discussion.

947
00:59:10,871 --> 00:59:11,871
It's done.

948
00:59:24,081 --> 00:59:25,381
(Ji Ok Bun)

949
00:59:27,521 --> 00:59:28,921
Hey, Ok Bun.

950
00:59:30,921 --> 00:59:32,251
Were you aware of this?

951
00:59:32,951 --> 00:59:34,021
Aware of what?

952
00:59:34,091 --> 00:59:35,391
It's about Heung Soo.

953
00:59:36,861 --> 00:59:39,361
He moved out of the rooftop unit to give you the deposit...

954
00:59:40,491 --> 00:59:42,831
and has been staying at a sauna.

955
00:59:43,661 --> 00:59:44,671
What?

956
00:59:46,371 --> 00:59:47,541
You did the right thing.

957
00:59:48,841 --> 00:59:51,241
That was the only way to stop Mr. Go from moving...

958
00:59:51,571 --> 00:59:52,671
to the countryside.

959
00:59:56,141 --> 00:59:57,141
Come in.

960
01:00:00,451 --> 01:00:01,451
Mom.

961
01:00:05,321 --> 01:00:07,321
Can you offer a 2-for-1 deal?

962
01:00:08,561 --> 01:00:10,261
A 2-for-1 deal?

963
01:00:10,261 --> 01:00:11,261
Yes.

964
01:00:12,131 --> 01:00:15,661
I think Heung Soo will have to move in too.

965
01:00:15,901 --> 01:00:16,961
What?

966
01:00:17,471 --> 01:00:18,471
Are you saying...

967
01:00:18,471 --> 01:00:19,601
all four brothers-in-law should move in?

968
01:00:20,071 --> 01:00:21,441
Otherwise,

969
01:00:21,441 --> 01:00:23,601
I'll have to close the brewery.

970
01:00:25,071 --> 01:00:27,111
Are you kidding me?

971

(Eagle Brewery)

974
01:00:45,761 --> 01:00:47,861
- Salute. - Salute.

975
01:00:49,501 --> 01:00:50,931
- Hop in. - Sure.

976
01:00:54,801 --> 01:00:55,871
- Let me help. - Right.

977
01:00:55,871 --> 01:00:58,041
My gosh.

978
01:01:00,781 --> 01:01:02,711
Now, let's head home.

979
01:01:02,711 --> 01:01:03,811
Yes, let's...

980
01:01:03,811 --> 01:01:06,451
- go! - Go!

(Eagle Brewery Unrefined Makgeolli)

982
01:01:15,621 --> 01:01:16,621
Hold on.

983
01:01:17,191 --> 01:01:18,831
Isn't that Beom Soo's car?

984
01:01:21,301 --> 01:01:25,731
(Eagle Brewery)

985
01:01:25,731 --> 01:01:29,741
(Eagle Brewery)

986
01:01:39,011 --> 01:01:41,121
Hey, what brings you here?

987
01:01:41,251 --> 01:01:42,881
I could ask you the same thing.

988
01:01:46,921 --> 01:01:48,421
- You're here. - Hey.

989
01:01:49,021 --> 01:01:51,461
Gosh, Ha Ni.

990
01:01:54,201 --> 01:01:55,231
I'm glad you're here.

991
01:01:57,571 --> 01:01:58,731
- You too? - You too?

992
01:02:00,071 --> 01:02:01,201
Unbelievable.

993
01:02:02,341 --> 01:02:05,641
Welcome home, my brothers-in-law.

994
01:02:21,691 --> 01:02:22,891
Eagle Number Three...

995
01:02:23,721 --> 01:02:25,091
and Eagle Number Four...

996
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:27,091
returned home together.

997
01:02:28,361 --> 01:02:29,631
As of today, we...

998
01:02:31,201 --> 01:02:33,631
Sir, where should I place your belongings?

999
01:02:33,631 --> 01:02:35,101
You'll need to move the car.

1000
01:02:35,171 --> 01:02:36,601
Just a second.

1001
01:02:36,601 --> 01:02:38,011
- I'll take Ha Ni. - Right.

1002
01:02:38,871 --> 01:02:40,671
- What a sweetheart. - Beom Soo, wait for me.

1003
01:02:40,671 --> 01:02:41,841
Okay, good.

1004
01:02:42,611 --> 01:02:44,151
I'll move the truck.

1005
01:02:44,151 --> 01:02:45,181
Sure.

1006
01:02:47,151 --> 01:02:48,181
That leaves me with nothing to do.

1007
01:02:48,281 --> 01:02:49,351
Hey, Ha Ni.

1008
01:03:00,591 --> 01:03:01,961
As of today,

1009
01:03:02,601 --> 01:03:04,061
the Five Eagle Siblings...

1010
01:03:04,931 --> 01:03:06,431
are fully united as one.

(For Eagle Brothers)

1012
01:03:50,411 --> 01:03:52,411
Wait. If it's not an important event,

1013
01:03:52,411 --> 01:03:54,251
let's postpone today's plans.

1014
01:03:54,421 --> 01:03:57,451
It's something special that means a lot to me.

1015
01:03:57,621 --> 01:03:59,691
I wanted to wear a new suit.

1016
01:04:00,091 --> 01:04:02,161
That fool you call a professor...

1017
01:04:02,161 --> 01:04:04,391
seduced my daughter and ruined her life!

1018
01:04:04,391 --> 01:04:05,391
Mom!

1019
01:04:05,391 --> 01:04:07,961
I didn't know you were this low-class.

1020
01:04:08,231 --> 01:04:09,501
You're the worst.

1021
01:04:10,001 --> 01:04:13,171
Have you thought about it over the past ten days?

1022
01:04:13,531 --> 01:04:17,241
It's time to hear the outcome of your careful consideration.

1023
01:04:17,471 --> 01:04:20,941
Why don't we become an official couple?
