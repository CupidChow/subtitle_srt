00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:03,680
(Episode 9)

2
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:15,789
- Why can't I...
- Kwang Sook!

3
00:00:15,789 --> 00:00:17,620
- Yes?
- Unfasten your seat belt first.

4
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,460
- Gosh, I'm not in my right mind.
- There.

5
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:26,429
Kwang Sook, the surgery went well,
so he'll be fine.

6
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:27,429
Please calm down.

7
00:00:27,429 --> 00:00:30,640
Even his battalion commander called
to tell us we didn't have to worry.

8
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:34,109
I know,
but I refuse to believe anyone...

9
00:00:34,109 --> 00:00:36,880
until I see him for myself.

10
00:00:37,509 --> 00:00:39,380
- Kwang Sook, wait.
- Kwang Sook!

11
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:40,850
Wait for me.

12
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:42,710
(Intensive Care Unit)

13
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,549
Has Oh Kang Soo
regained consciousness?

14
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:49,189
Yes, he just woke up
from the anesthesia...

15
00:00:49,189 --> 00:00:50,320
and regained consciousness.

16
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,719
So the surgery went well?

17
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,890
There won't be any aftereffects,
right?

18
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:56,960
May I ask your relationship
to the patient?

19
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,000
Sorry?

20
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:00,929
Oh, right.

21
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:03,270
We know each other quite well.

22
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,769
I guess you can say
we're like family.

23
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:14,310
My gosh.

24
00:01:15,379 --> 00:01:17,450
We're
Lieutenant Oh Kang Soo's family.

25
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:19,719
Are we allowed to see him?

26
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:21,219
He regained consciousness
after surgery...

27
00:01:21,219 --> 00:01:22,750
but can't accept visitors.

28
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,819
His battalion commander said
the surgery went well.

29
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:28,159
Nothing went wrong with his head?

30
00:01:28,489 --> 00:01:29,989
He's fine.

31
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,400
(Intensive Care Unit)

32
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,700
Are you Lieutenant Oh's family?

33
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:39,239
- Yes.
- Yes, we are.

34
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:40,969
I'm naval surgeon Han Gyeol.

35
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:42,609
I see.

36
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:45,609
How is Kang Soo?

37
00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:48,010
Lieutenant Oh was brought
to the hospital...

38
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:49,609
with a head laceration
that was accompanied...

39
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:50,980
by excessive bleeding
and signs of a concussion.

40
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,150
A CT scan of his brain...

41
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,719
didn't show any major abnormalities,

42
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:55,390
so we proceeded
to treat the laceration.

43
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,159
We've been able
to stop the bleeding.

44
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,459
Nothing happened
to his brain, right?

45
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:02,030
I doubt this will lead
to a brain issue,

46
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,430
but we're keeping an eye on it
just in case.

47
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,300
- Kwang Sook.
- Are you okay?

48
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:12,370
Why did he need surgery, then?

49
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,210
His left humerus...
This bone was fractured.

50
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,840
He needed
emergency surgery for that.

51
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:19,039
A month of rest in a cast
and he should be...

52
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,150
as good as new.

53
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,680
Thank you.

54
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:24,849
Thanks. Please take good care
of my brother-in-law.

55
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:26,550
I'll do my best.

56
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:27,689
Thank you.

57
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,620
My gosh.

58
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:31,759
Oh, dear.

59
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:41,129
The call cannot be connected.
Transferring to...

60
00:02:41,229 --> 00:02:42,770
That's strange.

61
00:02:45,969 --> 00:02:47,870
What's wrong? You can't reach her?

62
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,939
No. Is something wrong?

63
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,539
Did you talk to Gyeol?

64
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,949
They met and parted during the day.

65
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,120
Goodness.

66
00:02:59,949 --> 00:03:01,050
Mom.

67
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:04,719
I called over ten times.
Why didn't you pick up?

68
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,719
Is something wrong?

69
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:08,389
Give me the phone.

70
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:09,889
I'll put Dad on.

71
00:03:13,229 --> 00:03:14,370
Where are you right now?

72
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,240
Where do you think I am?
I'm in Jinhae.

73
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,370
Why are you still there
and not here?

74
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,169
My goodness.

75
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,539
Why are you shouting at me?

76
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,310
You met and parted with Gyeol
during the day.

77
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,050
What are you still doing there?

78
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,819
Why didn't you answer your phone?

79
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:33,650
I didn't know the battery had died.

80
00:03:33,689 --> 00:03:35,189
I just charged it.

81
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:41,629
Since I'm here,
I'll enjoy the seaside a bit...

82
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,289
and have some raw fish.

83
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,400
I'll spend the night here
and return tomorrow.

84
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,270
You'll come back tomorrow?

85
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm tired.

86
00:03:51,699 --> 00:03:52,969
I'll be back early tomorrow.

87
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:55,340
What about my food, then?

88
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,780
Eat out with Se Ri or order in.

89
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,909
- Figure something out.
- What's wrong?

90
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,349
"Figure something out?"

91
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:06,650
Is that something
a housewife should say?

92
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:11,219
You eat 3 times a day,
365 days a year.

93
00:04:11,889 --> 00:04:14,330
Can't you eat just anything
for once?

94
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:15,560
Why should I eat just anything...

95
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,829
when I work day and night
to afford to eat well?

96
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:21,370
Food.

97
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:24,269
Can you quit asking for food?

98
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:27,639
Can't you let it go
on a day like this?

99
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,009
What's so special
about "a day like this?"

100
00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:31,240
What is today?

101
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:38,279
Are you seeing someone?

102
00:04:40,149 --> 00:04:41,149
What?

103
00:04:41,149 --> 00:04:42,850
Who is it? Put him on!

104
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,319
Put him on!

105
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:50,230
Would you put him on if you were me?

106
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,000
Bye!

107
00:04:55,569 --> 00:04:56,629
Darn him.

108
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,170
Darn it.

109
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:04,379
I'd feel butterflies at least
if I were seeing someone.

110
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,709
I was stressed to death
all day long.

111
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,350
Ma'am.

112
00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:16,589
Can I have another soju?

113
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:31,699
Do you...

114
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,970
recognize me?

115
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:38,310
Kwang Sook?

116
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:43,350
What about me? Who am I?

117
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,490
Hey.

118
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:54,029
Why don't you recognize me?
I'm your third older brother.

119
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,230
Hey.

120
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:00,970
How can you recognize her
and not me?

121
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:03,699
Oh Kang Soo. Pull yourself together.

122
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:07,040
Look at me. Do you know who I am?

123
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:14,879
The doctor said he'd hurt his head.

124
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,279
Is something wrong?

125
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:19,779
You really don't know me?

126
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:21,490
Hey.

127
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:23,519
Why are you grinning?

128
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:26,120
He's joking, which means he's okay.

129
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:28,029
What?

130
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:30,829
My scalp was ripped,

131
00:06:30,829 --> 00:06:32,199
but my brain's fine.

132
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,800
Don't act like I'm stupid.

133
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:35,899
Darn it.

134
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,769
I almost had a heart attack.

135
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:41,269
How could you...

136
00:06:41,269 --> 00:06:43,610
- Don't do that.
- You can't hurt a patient.

137
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:44,639
Sorry.

138
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,180
You didn't hurt your face.

139
00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:48,709
The surgery was an ordeal,
wasn't it?

140
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,379
Good job.

141
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,379
It's bearable. I'm okay.

142
00:06:53,949 --> 00:06:56,589
The doctor said your head was fine
and the surgery...

143
00:06:56,589 --> 00:06:57,860
on the fracture went well.

144
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,290
I'm sorry for causing worry.

145
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,199
I'm sorry, Kwang Sook.

146
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,430
Why would you apologize?

147
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:13,399
I'm glad it wasn't any worse.

148
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:15,040
When I got the call,

149
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,410
my mind went blank.

150
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:19,339
You idiot.

151
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:22,850
You should've turned a blind eye
to something that dangerous.

152
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,079
Why did you jump into the sea?

153
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:28,050
Why would you say something
that irresponsible?

154
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,319
Don't take it so seriously.

155
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:31,589
It was a joke. A lame one, I know.

156
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,420
How could you joke right now?

157
00:07:34,089 --> 00:07:36,589
It's not a joke if you mind
the time and place.

158
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:39,259
Are you warm enough?

159
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:53,439
- Hi, Mom.
- When will you be back?

160
00:07:54,509 --> 00:07:56,310
I'll be back soon.

161
00:07:56,449 --> 00:07:57,750
Why do you keep calling?

162
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,620
Did I or did I not warn you...

163
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,519
that your life
would get complicated...

164
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:04,389
if you got involved
with your brothers-in-law?

165
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:08,629
Why should you get involved
with everything that happens?

166
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,759
Should I be babysitting...

167
00:08:11,529 --> 00:08:13,230
at my age?

168
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:18,839
Why won't you answer?

169
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:22,040
Hello? Ma Kwang Sook!

170
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:23,769
Will you do this to me?

171
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:26,209
What's wrong with you?

172
00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:29,050
My gosh.

173
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:32,019
Why would you shout
and scare the baby?

174
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,320
Goodness.

175
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:36,019
I'm on edge, so don't aggravate me.

176
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:37,519
Don't cry.

177
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:38,789
Stop crying.

178
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:40,490
Stop!

179
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:42,759
My gosh.

180
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:44,929
Darn it.

181
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,629
I fed you and changed your diaper,

182
00:08:48,629 --> 00:08:50,529
so why are you crying?

183
00:08:51,139 --> 00:08:53,600
I carried you for so long
that my back's about to break.

184
00:08:53,769 --> 00:08:56,570
What are you so upset about?

185
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:58,009
Give her to me.

186
00:08:58,009 --> 00:08:59,009
No!

187
00:08:59,809 --> 00:09:03,149
She's crying
because she wants to sleep.

188
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:05,220
Hand her over.
I'll put her to sleep.

189
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,759
Good girl.

190
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,190
Peekaboo.

191
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:18,730
My little princess.

192
00:09:18,929 --> 00:09:20,399
Why are you in a bad mood?

193
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,399
Are you displeased about something?

194
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:26,299
Okay. Let's go inside.

195
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,309
What got into him?

196
00:09:29,309 --> 00:09:31,340
He was like
a wild boar that got shot.

197
00:09:32,379 --> 00:09:35,509
"Peekaboo. Is the princess
displeased about something?"

198
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:38,779
<i>Don't you bark, stray dog</i>

199
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:41,750
<i>You might wake our sleeping baby</i>

200
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:45,820
<i>Sleep well, darling</i>

201
00:09:46,289 --> 00:09:49,559
<i>Sleep well, baby</i>

202
00:09:54,029 --> 00:09:55,970
I'm trying to put
the little baby to sleep,

203
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:59,169
but the big baby fell asleep first.

204
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:12,279
(Eagle Brewery)

205
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:22,190
<i>Sleep well, darling</i>

206
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:29,299
Drive her safely back to Seoul.

207
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,629
Don't speed.

208
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:31,940
Don't worry.

209
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,639
I'm sorry to leave you here.

210
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:34,970
It's nothing.

211
00:10:36,309 --> 00:10:38,179
I get to catch up with Kang Soo...

212
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:39,539
and enjoy the seaside.

213
00:10:41,009 --> 00:10:43,049
You must be tired, Kwang Sook.
Try to sleep in the car.

214
00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:46,320
I'm fine. Don't worry about me.

215
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,519
Promise to call
if something happens.

216
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,820
Okay.

217
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,820
He'll be fine. You can relax.

218
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:55,960
Let's go, then.

219
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,360
- Bye, Chun Soo.
- Bye.

220
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,659
Take care.

221
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,600
Bye, Kwang Sook.

222
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:15,850
Hey.

223
00:11:16,549 --> 00:11:18,179
Why are you sitting up?

224
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:20,379
Lie down.

225
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,820
Move slowly.

226
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:34,600
Why didn't you go with them?

227
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:36,169
Why?

228
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:38,799
You don't like being with me?

229
00:11:40,809 --> 00:11:42,039
I feel bad.

230
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,940
Why would you say that?

231
00:11:44,909 --> 00:11:46,039
Are we strangers?

232
00:11:51,549 --> 00:11:53,679
I'm too ashamed to face Kwang Sook.

233
00:11:54,789 --> 00:11:56,220
I'm an extra burden.

234
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:58,059
I know.

235
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:01,889
She was really anxious
on her way here.

236
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,559
I actually felt bad for her
watching it.

237
00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:09,370
I didn't think
she really meant it...

238
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:15,340
when she said she would think of us
as her brothers.

239
00:12:17,309 --> 00:12:18,639
I bet she really meant it.

240
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:22,779
She was serious.

241
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:49,309
Hey, Kwang Sook is asleep.

242
00:12:52,909 --> 00:12:54,710
What Chun Soo did was wrong.

243
00:12:57,149 --> 00:12:58,220
What do you mean?

244
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,519
Why did he tell her
that Kang Soo was hurt?

245
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:04,019
He didn't mean to tell her.

246
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:08,460
He was at the brewery
to draft the contract...

247
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,789
with the convenience store company.

248
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,129
Still, he shouldn't have told
Kwang Sook.

249
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:16,870
It's not good for her
to keep getting involved with us.

250
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:22,039
I feel like we're holding her back.

251
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:37,490
Why are you crying, Kwang Sook?

252
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,360
Kwang Sook, are you feeling unwell?

253
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,929
I feel like it's my fault.

254
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:52,200
What happened to Jang Soo.

255
00:13:54,169 --> 00:13:56,470
And how Kang Soo got hurt.

256
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,509
It feels like it's my fault.

257
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:06,279
After I got married,

258
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:08,950
bad things have kept happening
to the family.

259
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:17,529
I was born with rotten luck.

260
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:23,730
I'm bringing misfortune
upon everyone...

261
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:56,200
Thank you...

262
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,139
for letting me use this.

263
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,240
Oh, right.

264
00:15:05,909 --> 00:15:08,279
It has too much of my snot.

265
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:12,120
I'll wash it clean
and give it back to you.

266
00:15:13,549 --> 00:15:14,850
You don't have to return it.

267
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:17,090
Is it a gift?

268
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,990
Use it when you're upset
and feel like crying.

269
00:15:20,789 --> 00:15:22,590
Don't use it too often though.

270
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:36,570
Jang Soo used to smell funky
when he was single,

271
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:39,240
but he became neat
after he got married.

272
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:41,950
We found out
how Chun Soo got fired...

273
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:44,720
and struggled alone
while keeping it to himself.

274
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:49,450
We also got to know how Beom Soo
got his lovely daughter.

275
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:53,159
And Kang Soo's injury
isn't as serious as we feared.

276
00:15:55,389 --> 00:15:57,590
All these things happened...

277
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,759
after you joined our family
with your good luck.

278
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:04,470
You're not someone
who brings misfortune.

279
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:08,009
For us, you're
an unexpected piece of good luck.

280
00:16:08,139 --> 00:16:09,370
You're our lucky charm.

281
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:14,909
Professor Oh, tell her if I'm wrong.

282
00:16:14,909 --> 00:16:16,850
He's absolutely right.

283
00:16:18,179 --> 00:16:19,250
Kwang Sook.

284
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:23,720
Don't be so weak.

285
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,190
Okay?

286
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:30,190
All right.

287
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,600
I promise.

288
00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:36,070
And I want you...

289
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:38,970
to promise me one thing.

290
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,409
Don't say...

291
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:50,980
that I'm not part of this family.

292
00:16:57,190 --> 00:17:00,190
Once a family, always a family.

293
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,590
I'm really sad...

294
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:07,329
when you treat me like a stranger...

295
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:09,970
just because your brother is gone.

296
00:17:12,269 --> 00:17:15,039
If you don't need a sister-in-law,

297
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:18,109
you can think of me as your sister.

298
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,109
Okay, sister.

299
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,980
You can't leave us...

300
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,589
until I become really popular
and let you live in luxury.

301
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,519
You'll be a ghost of our family.

302
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:38,359
Okay!

303
00:17:46,569 --> 00:17:48,240
Call me sister.

304
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,970
Forget it.

305
00:17:52,109 --> 00:17:54,180
Just call me like that once.

306
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:57,480
I mean, you're my sister-in-law.

307
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,779
That's just wrong.

308
00:17:58,779 --> 00:17:59,950
What a buzzkill.

309
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:02,049
Why would you throw a wet blanket
when things were going well?

310
00:18:09,859 --> 00:18:10,859
Sis...

311
00:18:15,869 --> 00:18:19,170
I was sorry and ashamed
that you had to go through all that,

312
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:20,539
so I tried to keep my distance.

313
00:18:22,369 --> 00:18:23,769
I won't be like that anymore.

314
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:27,079
I'm so glad...

315
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:29,950
that you say that.

316
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,890
Thank you.

317
00:18:42,029 --> 00:18:43,029
My gosh.

318
00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:45,230
The sky looks nice.

319
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:47,900
The stars are twinkling.

320
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:51,339
Jang Soo!

321
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,039
Are you watching us?

322
00:18:56,109 --> 00:18:58,079
As you can see, we're doing well.

323
00:19:02,779 --> 00:19:03,980
So...

324
00:19:05,619 --> 00:19:07,720
don't worry about us.

325
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:11,759
Just take good care
of yourself there.

326
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,160
I miss you, Jang Soo.

327
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,730
You should say something.

328
00:19:21,329 --> 00:19:22,430
I'm okay.

329
00:19:28,069 --> 00:19:29,069
Jang Soo.

330
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:33,079
Watch over Kwang Sook
and the four of us from up there.

331
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:57,940
- Hello, sir.
- Hello, sir.

332
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:04,009
This is Jang-Kwang Makgeolli
delivered from Eagle Brewery.

333
00:20:04,009 --> 00:20:05,880
- Hello, Ms. Ma.
- Hello.

334
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,140
We're really excited.

335
00:20:07,579 --> 00:20:08,710
Please look forward to it.

336
00:20:09,109 --> 00:20:11,180
It's finally being revealed!

337
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,579
Yes!

338
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:17,650
(Eagle Brewery)

339
00:20:18,589 --> 00:20:20,019
Ta-da.

340
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:21,460
It looks so fancy.

341
00:20:21,859 --> 00:20:25,230
I know, right?
It looks so distinguished.

342
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:28,970
It deserves to be called
the champagne of makgeolli.

343
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:33,140
Thank you again
for believing in Eagle Brewery...

344
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:35,269
and giving us a chance.

345
00:20:35,869 --> 00:20:37,910
Before we start
selling Jang-Kwang Makgeolli,

346
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:41,309
we even made a cup
specially designed for it.

347
00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:45,079
It's used only at our hotel,
so it's not for sale.

348
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:48,549
But I packed two sets for you.

349
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:51,049
My goodness. Thank you.

350
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:54,490
- This is so pretty.
- I know.

351
00:20:55,329 --> 00:20:56,930
To celebrate the first delivery,

352
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:58,799
why don't you taste it a little?

353
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,759
- Shall we?
- That'd be great.

354
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,269
Of course, we should taste it.

355
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:04,839
Since this is highly carbonated,

356
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:06,740
- open it gently.
- Gently.

357
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:09,140
Be careful with it and be gentle.

358
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,380
Slowly and gently.

359
00:21:13,509 --> 00:21:14,910
Goodness, Chairman Han.

360
00:21:20,019 --> 00:21:21,319
- Oh, no.
- Oh, dear!

361
00:21:25,789 --> 00:21:26,819
What...

362
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:30,329
My gosh!

363
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:55,019
Goodness me. My gosh.

364
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,119
I'm so sorry, Chairman Han.

365
00:21:57,119 --> 00:21:58,789
It slipped out of my hands.

366
00:22:04,529 --> 00:22:05,700
You should head to your office.

367
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:07,859
I'll grab a change of clothes
while you wash up.

368
00:22:09,069 --> 00:22:10,200
Let's do that.

369
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,500
Oh, dear.

370
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:17,170
Are you all right? Oh, no.

371
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,279
What now?

372
00:22:20,579 --> 00:22:21,680
Just a second!

373
00:22:22,849 --> 00:22:23,880
Hold on.

374
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,349
Chairman Han.

375
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,750
What now?

376
00:22:29,789 --> 00:22:30,789
Well,

377
00:22:31,289 --> 00:22:32,759
wipe it down with this for now.

378
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:34,390
I'm good.

379
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:37,490
You're drenched.
You should dry yourself.

380
00:22:38,029 --> 00:22:39,400
I said I was good.

381
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,859
I'm fine,

382
00:22:41,099 --> 00:22:43,700
so wipe yourself down
and don't be concerned about me.

383
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:45,339
Unbelievable.

384
00:22:46,269 --> 00:22:47,839
(Eagle Brewery)

385
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,779
I'm so sorry.

386
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,210
I wronged you
in one of the worst ways possible.

387
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,849
I'm sorry.

388
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:07,089
Why did he have to come in
at that exact moment?

389
00:23:09,589 --> 00:23:11,289
He must've been so flustered.

390
00:23:14,529 --> 00:23:15,829
Gosh, what do I do?

391
00:23:25,309 --> 00:23:26,380
Darn.

392
00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:28,349
Why does she keep popping up
in my life?

393
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,180
Unbelievable.

394
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:35,690
My gosh.

395
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:40,359
What?

396
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:42,730
Lieutenant Oh got hurt? How?

397
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:44,690
What's wrong? You startled us.

398
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:59,279
Bom, where are you headed?

399
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,339
To Jinhae.

400
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,710
That's out of the blue.

401
00:24:02,309 --> 00:24:03,779
Did something happen to Gyeol?

402
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:06,750
No, it's not that.
Lieutenant Oh was injured...

403
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:09,089
while training
and had to undergo surgery.

404
00:24:09,089 --> 00:24:10,119
I'm on my way to see him.

405
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:12,089
Is it bad?

406
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:13,920
I don't think it's anything serious.

407
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,529
That's a relief.

408
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:16,690
Where's your car?

409
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:18,700
I didn't drive to school today
and am going to take the bus.

410
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:21,430
It's almost here, so I'll take off.

411
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:23,569
But I wanted to have lunch with you.

412
00:24:24,069 --> 00:24:25,740
Got it. Have a safe trip.

413
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:27,640
- Sure. Sorry about this, Se Ri.
- No problem.

414
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:33,579
I guess I should eat alone.

415
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:35,579
But I'm tired
of the school cafeteria.

416
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:43,190
Professor.

417
00:24:44,089 --> 00:24:45,819
- Hey, Se Ri.
- Hello.

418
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,890
Have you decided on what to eat?

419
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:51,259
I'm not sure.
Nothing's calling out to me.

420
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:55,170
Would you like to eat
at my favorite restaurant?

421
00:24:55,529 --> 00:24:57,170
- Your favorite restaurant?
- Yes.

422
00:24:57,299 --> 00:24:58,869
This naengmyeon place
near the side gate...

423
00:24:58,869 --> 00:25:00,400
serves the best food.

424
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:07,539
You promised to buy me
something delicious, remember?

425
00:25:07,809 --> 00:25:10,250
I did, but the time...

426
00:25:11,579 --> 00:25:14,220
You have an hour and 28 minutes
until class.

427
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:15,750
That's more than enough.

428
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:23,890
Is Ha Ni doing well, Professor?

429
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:25,460
Of course.

430
00:25:26,299 --> 00:25:29,000
I don't think I've seen a baby
as pretty as her before.

431
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:32,400
Even if I get married
and have a child,

432
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:35,069
my babies won't be as pretty as her.

433
00:25:35,269 --> 00:25:37,309
They'll be pretty
if they take after you.

434
00:25:38,109 --> 00:25:39,140
Hold on.

435
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:42,079
Was that you saying I'm pretty?

436
00:25:42,309 --> 00:25:43,309
What?

437
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,420
Well...

438
00:25:50,819 --> 00:25:53,589
If anything comes up
with your babysitter,

439
00:25:53,589 --> 00:25:54,890
give me a call any time.

440
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:56,190
I'll be there in a heartbeat.

441
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:59,529
Things happened so fast
that I was out of options that day.

442
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,329
I won't trouble you like that again.

443
00:26:02,829 --> 00:26:04,329
You didn't trouble me at all.

444
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:07,670
How could babysitting a little fairy
like Ha Ni ever be a burden?

445
00:26:07,869 --> 00:26:08,970
It was therapeutic.

446
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,809
Thank you for putting it that way.

447
00:26:14,809 --> 00:26:15,809
By the way,

448
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,279
my Ha Ni...

449
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,690
She pulled herself up
on her feet yesterday.

450
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:25,859
I didn't even teach her that,

451
00:26:25,859 --> 00:26:27,559
but she stood on her first attempt.

452
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:30,430
You have no idea
how surprised I was.

453
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:32,160
Having such advanced motor skills...

454
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:34,700
should put her
in the top one percent.

455
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,970
What is it? Did I sound funny?

456
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:43,640
It's not that, Professor.

457
00:26:43,809 --> 00:26:45,339
It's unexpected, that's all.

458
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:49,880
When I first met you,
I thought you were a bachelor.

459
00:26:50,779 --> 00:26:53,619
I was surprised to know
you had a cute daughter like Ha Ni.

460
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:56,750
Also, you seemed like someone
cold and brusque,

461
00:26:57,319 --> 00:27:00,160
but you have a soft spot
for your daughter.

462
00:27:01,289 --> 00:27:03,089
Do I seem that way to you?

463
00:27:03,329 --> 00:27:05,299
Yes, you do.

464
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,500
And here I thought I looked like
a copier repair guy.

465
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:13,700
Well, that's...

466
00:27:13,869 --> 00:27:16,970
Something was obviously wrong
with my head.

467
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:20,380
Could you please forget
what happened that day? Please.

468
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:23,849
Here you go.

469
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,150
Thank you.

470
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:28,390
- Enjoy.
- Thanks.

471
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:32,960
Professor, no!

472
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:36,859
You can't cut the noodles
with scissors.

473
00:27:37,259 --> 00:27:39,329
The noodles will lose
the good energy of buckwheat.

474
00:27:40,529 --> 00:27:41,599
What do you mean by that?

475
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:44,069
It's a well-known fact
among those who are...

476
00:27:44,069 --> 00:27:45,539
TPLPN.

477
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,839
"TPLPN?"

478
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:49,769
Those who take pride in their love
for Pyongyang naengmyeon.

479
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:55,779
The noodle presser is made of steel.

480
00:27:55,809 --> 00:27:58,109
I doubt cutting it with scissors
will do more harm.

481
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:08,490
Professor, no!

482
00:28:10,029 --> 00:28:12,059
You can't add vinegar or mustard.

483
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,170
There's a rule. This must be enjoyed
for its subtle and clean flavors.

484
00:28:18,069 --> 00:28:19,940
That's a no to vinegar or mustard.

485
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,839
I should eat it however I like.

486
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:24,009
Why should I follow some rule?

487
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:28,109
Someone's personal preferences
become the social norm,

488
00:28:28,109 --> 00:28:30,779
and those who don't follow them
are considered wrong?

489
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:33,880
I believe that can be considered
an act of violence.

490
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:37,589
- Really?
- Unless it harms anyone,

491
00:28:37,589 --> 00:28:40,119
I can do whatever I want
and eat things how I see fit.

492
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,390
There aren't many things in life
we can control,

493
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:45,759
so why restrict ourselves
with food rules too?

494
00:28:46,329 --> 00:28:47,329
Don't you agree?

495
00:29:10,349 --> 00:29:12,490
Actually, this is way better.

496
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:19,359
- How are your younger cousins?
- Sorry?

497
00:29:22,529 --> 00:29:23,900
Didn't you say
you had many younger cousins?

498
00:29:32,579 --> 00:29:33,680
Oh, that?

499
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:36,710
They're fine.

500
00:29:37,809 --> 00:29:38,920
How many do you have?

501
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,049
Three. Two sisters and one brother.

502
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,490
Taking care of them
must've been tough.

503
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:47,259
It wasn't that bad.

504
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:49,329
Only just a bit.

505
00:29:51,029 --> 00:29:53,200
By the way,
how many siblings do you have?

506
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:55,599
My parents had five boys.

507
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,970
I have three older brothers...

508
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:00,269
and one younger brother.

509
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:04,569
You're the fourth brother
among five, then.

510
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,710
That's right.

511
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:10,579
Is your wife still in the US?

512
00:30:12,819 --> 00:30:13,819
What?

513
00:30:13,819 --> 00:30:16,819
Seeing that a baby as young as Ha Ni
goes to a babysitter every day,

514
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:19,089
I assumed your wife
was still in the US.

515
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,359
Or maybe she's busy working
like you.

516
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:24,559
Chairman Jang Je Hyeong
of Daeheung Group...

517
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:25,960
announced his wedding.

518
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,259
This morning,
Chairman Jang Je Hyeong...

519
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:30,829
announced the news on social media.

520
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,769
The wife-to-be is Ms. Na Young Eun,

521
00:30:32,769 --> 00:30:35,170
an accomplished woman
who earned her MBA in the US...

522
00:30:35,269 --> 00:30:39,039
and is actually 25 years his junior.

523
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:43,450
Rumors about his marriage
had been circulating for a while,

524
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:45,180
and they turned out to be true.

525
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:52,519
What event
has you dressed up like that?

526
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:55,190
A dinner with
Korean and American entrepreneurs.

527
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:56,759
I'll be there as an interpreter.

528
00:30:57,930 --> 00:31:00,599
Isn't it too much
for a mother to be wearing?

529
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:02,930
That's the dress code.

530
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:06,670
Haven't you been
to a party in the US before?

531
00:31:07,339 --> 00:31:08,670
Don't be so old-fashioned.

532
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:12,180
It's a dinner for entrepreneurs,
but that dress isn't formal...

533
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:14,539
I'm being paid a lot
to be an interpreter,

534
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:16,279
so say nothing more.

535
00:31:20,019 --> 00:31:21,750
How can you talk to me like that?

536
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:24,650
There's a world
you're clueless about.

537
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:28,460
Don't think you're above everyone
for having a fancy degree.

538
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:30,690
- Na Young Eun.
- You have your life,

539
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:32,400
and I also have mine.

540
00:31:33,329 --> 00:31:34,930
Don't poke your nose in my business.

541
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:37,029
What do you mean?
You say that like we're strangers.

542
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:39,440
That'd actually be better.

543
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:42,809
What do you mean by that?

544
00:31:45,609 --> 00:31:47,509
I asked what you meant by that!

545
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:51,279
Oh, no.

546
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:53,980
Ha Ni, I bet that startled you.

547
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:55,450
Don't cry.

548
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,450
I'm running late for the party.

549
00:31:58,819 --> 00:31:59,990
Let's talk later.

550
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,029
Ha Ni.

551
00:32:06,829 --> 00:32:07,900
Professor.

552
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:09,599
Professor?

553
00:32:10,829 --> 00:32:11,869
Yes?

554
00:32:12,769 --> 00:32:14,140
Is something the matter?

555
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,369
It's nothing.

556
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:33,019
Hello?

557
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,789
Are you out?

558
00:32:35,529 --> 00:32:37,160
I'm on my way to Jinhae.

559
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:39,700
You're going to Jinhae again?

560
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,259
My goodness.

561
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:44,299
Can you stop yelling?
That could cause an accident.

562
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:48,500
I mean, Jinhae isn't some cafe
in a nearby neighborhood.

563
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:51,240
It takes 5 to 6 hours to get there.
I can't believe you're going again.

564
00:32:51,339 --> 00:32:53,910
It's to give Gyeol some side dishes.

565
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,380
Side dishes?

566
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:58,650
Why would you do that
when he lives so far away?

567
00:32:58,650 --> 00:32:59,680
Are you out of your mind?

568
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,450
You want the son
of LX Hotel's chairman...

569
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:03,589
as your son-in-law
without putting in this much effort?

570
00:33:03,849 --> 00:33:05,990
If I could, I wouldn't stop at
just bringing him side dishes.

571
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:08,359
I'd clean his house
and do his laundry too.

572
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:12,130
Going overboard
might ruin everything.

573
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:14,500
I'm telling you to play it cool.

574
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:19,700
You always expect things
to just fall in your lap.

575
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:20,970
What?

576
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:23,670
To obtain something valuable,
one must pay the price.

577
00:33:24,069 --> 00:33:25,779
You try to blow your nose
without using your hands...

578
00:33:25,779 --> 00:33:28,410
and stand under an apple tree
with your mouth wide open.

579
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:29,980
Am I wrong?

580
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:33,079
What on earth are you saying, woman?

581
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:34,180
Are you done talking?

582
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,720
(CEO Dokgo Tak)

583
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,720
Hello? What the...

584
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:40,460
Seriously?

585
00:33:41,859 --> 00:33:43,230
Unbelievable.

586
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:45,799
What has gotten into this woman?

587
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,430
She bites back at every word I say
and challenges me.

588
00:33:51,569 --> 00:33:52,569
Come in!

589
00:33:57,539 --> 00:33:58,609
You summoned me, sir?

590
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:01,839
We haven't heard back
from Eagle Brewery, have we?

591
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:03,109
I'm afraid not.

592
00:34:04,779 --> 00:34:05,880
Should I give the CEO a call?

593
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,450
No, don't.

594
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,550
If we seem desperate,

595
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:12,219
that'll only feed her ego.

596
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,460
It's not the way to go.

597
00:34:15,059 --> 00:34:16,090
We need...

598
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:19,960
to think of another approach.

599
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:26,170
(Doum Real Estate)

600
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:28,769
All right.
The transaction will be complete...

601
00:34:28,769 --> 00:34:30,670
once you sign the papers.

602
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:38,849
(Contract of Property Sale)

603
00:34:38,849 --> 00:34:40,480
You want me to move out?

604
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:45,960
As you can see,

605
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,360
the building now belongs to me,

606
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,559
Ji Ok Bun.

607
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:53,800
Your lease for ten years
expires next month,

608
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:57,000
so I need you to move out.

609
00:34:58,469 --> 00:35:01,400
You think owning this tiny building
makes you superior?

610
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,510
That's so cheap.

611
00:35:02,769 --> 00:35:05,510
Goodness.
If you think I'm being cheap,

612
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:08,739
buy yourself a bigger building...

613
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:10,510
and move your academy there.

614
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,349
Isn't this too cowardly?

615
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,820
- What?
- Once I leave this neighborhood,

616
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,750
you think you and Mr. Oh
will have a chance.

617
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,820
That's why you're driving me out.

618
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:23,789
You don't have it in you
to fight for him fair and square.

619
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:28,659
Don't spit out words
only because you can.

620
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:34,099
You could never beat me.

621
00:35:34,769 --> 00:35:37,340
So study up some more,
you callow witch.

622
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:39,309
"Callow witch?"

623
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:42,280
Hey! Are you done talking?

624
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:45,750
You'll regret
abusing your power on me.

625
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:48,550
Who do you think you are speaking
to me like I'm beneath you?

626
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:51,190
Act your age if that bothers you.

627
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:54,059
In what way haven't I acted my age?

628
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:55,630
Tell me.

629
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:57,530
In what way haven't I acted my age?

630
00:36:04,099 --> 00:36:06,369
Throwing yourself at a man
who isn't interested in you...

631
00:36:06,369 --> 00:36:07,739
is not acting your age.

632
00:36:08,139 --> 00:36:09,940
That's exactly it.

633
00:36:12,309 --> 00:36:16,079
You shouldn't covet someone
who's out of your league.

634
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,019
Just because your mouth works...

635
00:36:20,019 --> 00:36:21,480
doesn't mean
you have to run it wild.

636
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:25,320
Hey, know your place!

637
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:27,460
- Let go of me!
- No!

638
00:36:32,429 --> 00:36:34,130
Let go of her!

639
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:37,300
Mr. Oh.

640
00:36:39,539 --> 00:36:40,639
Are you all right?

641
00:36:42,369 --> 00:36:46,280
It's nothing, so please pretend
you didn't see anything.

642
00:36:46,539 --> 00:36:48,340
How is this nothing?

643
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,079
Ms. Ji!

644
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:52,949
Are you a female thug?

645
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,320
What?

646
00:36:58,449 --> 00:37:00,019
"A thug?"

647
00:37:09,469 --> 00:37:10,670
Are you sure you're all right?

648
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:17,840
"A female thug?"

649
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:20,880
How could he say something so harsh?

650
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:29,489
You don't know what's been going on,

651
00:37:29,489 --> 00:37:31,789
so why are you blindly
taking her side?

652
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:33,820
In a nutshell,

653
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:37,059
since Ms. Ji now owns the building,

654
00:37:37,489 --> 00:37:39,400
she's abusing her power on you.

655
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,329
I wouldn't put it in those words.

656
00:37:41,329 --> 00:37:44,000
The ten-year lease
is now coming to an end,

657
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,599
so she's telling me to move out.

658
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:49,710
But I've grown attached
to my students,

659
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:51,809
and I don't want to leave
this neighborhood.

660
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:56,650
My dad keeps telling me
to move the academy...

661
00:37:56,949 --> 00:37:58,949
to the building he has in Gangnam.

662
00:37:59,719 --> 00:38:02,949
However, I want to help the students
and parents in this neighborhood...

663
00:38:02,949 --> 00:38:05,659
who have relatively little access
to education of good quality...

664
00:38:05,989 --> 00:38:08,559
compared to those in Gangnam,

665
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:12,090
so they can discover
the true value...

666
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:13,760
of classical music.

667
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,670
So there was such a deeper purpose
behind it.

668
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:20,440
Ms. Kim, you are a true educator.

669
00:38:29,909 --> 00:38:30,909
You're here.

670
00:38:30,909 --> 00:38:32,820
I didn't know you had company.

671
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,690
He was just leaving.

672
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:38,949
- I have a lesson.
- Right, I'll get going.

673
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:41,860
I'll talk to Ms. Ji on your behalf,

674
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:43,559
so don't worry too much.

675
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,230
Take care.

676
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:50,630
Sure.

677
00:38:59,179 --> 00:39:01,309
You can't come unannounced
like this.

678
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:07,050
Eun Seo hasn't been
eating all day...

679
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:09,349
and is refusing
to go to classes at the academy.

680
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:11,849
What now? What has you complaining?

681
00:39:11,989 --> 00:39:13,219
I want a perm.

682
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,460
I already said no.

683
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:17,090
Why do you get to decide
everything, Mom?

684
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:19,400
There are things
I want to do as well.

685
00:39:20,829 --> 00:39:22,530
Life is already a hassle for me,

686
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:25,300
so why do you keep adding onto that?

687
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:41,079
Work is tough, isn't it?

688
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,050
I greeted you the other day.

689
00:39:44,489 --> 00:39:45,519
(Eagle Brewery)

690
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:48,920
I'm the CEO of Eagle Brewery.

691
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:51,059
The makgeolli brewer, right?

692
00:39:51,059 --> 00:39:52,460
That's right. Makgeolli.

693
00:39:52,929 --> 00:39:54,860
I'd like to put these in the trunk.

694
00:39:54,929 --> 00:39:55,929
Sorry?

695
00:39:57,070 --> 00:40:00,300
I got to supply this hotel
thanks to the chairman's favor,

696
00:40:00,539 --> 00:40:03,469
so I want to give him a small gift
as a token of my gratitude.

697
00:40:03,809 --> 00:40:06,139
The chairman didn't mention
anything about it.

698
00:40:06,139 --> 00:40:08,610
It's not expensive.
I want to show...

699
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:11,150
how I feel, so there's no pressure.

700
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:13,150
And...

701
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:14,920
this is for you.

702
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,750
You don't have to give me anything.

703
00:40:18,489 --> 00:40:21,260
The chairman's like my new lifeline,

704
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:24,190
and you drive him safely around.

705
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:26,030
That means you're special too.

706
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,760
- Here.
- Well...

707
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,570
Keep it in the fridge
and drink it cold.

708
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:33,269
What a lovely gift.

709
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,469
Thank you. I'll enjoy this.

710
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:43,079
Hello, Kwang Sook.

711
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,650
How do you feel?

712
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:47,550
There's almost no pain.
I'm just fine.

713
00:40:49,389 --> 00:40:50,920
I told Chun Soo to leave today.

714
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:55,789
Yes, of course.
I can manage on my own just fine.

715
00:40:58,559 --> 00:40:59,659
Chun Soo?

716
00:41:00,099 --> 00:41:01,329
Sure. Just a moment.

717
00:41:02,869 --> 00:41:04,630
- She wants to talk to you.
- Okay.

718
00:41:07,239 --> 00:41:08,369
Hello?

719
00:41:10,639 --> 00:41:11,909
It wasn't hard at all.

720
00:41:12,579 --> 00:41:14,840
I enjoyed catching up with him.

721
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,949
Yes. I'll call when I'm back.

722
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:20,719
Bye.

723
00:41:25,219 --> 00:41:26,960
The next bus
doesn't leave for a while, right?

724
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,630
No. I have some time.

725
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:33,500
Shall we have a coffee?

726
00:41:42,969 --> 00:41:44,710
Are you okay
with vending machine coffee?

727
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:46,840
I love it.

728
00:42:45,429 --> 00:42:46,739
You'll leave the Navy?

729
00:42:50,869 --> 00:42:52,110
I think I should.

730
00:42:53,909 --> 00:42:56,449
Your head's fine,
and the arm surgery went well.

731
00:42:56,449 --> 00:42:58,449
I'd made up my mind
before this accident.

732
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:05,190
I had middle ear inflammation
a few times as a kid.

733
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:08,559
Now I have hearing issues.

734
00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:11,960
The doctor said if I kept on diving,

735
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,929
I could lose my hearing.

736
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:17,869
Why are you saying this now?

737
00:43:17,869 --> 00:43:19,230
I never had the chance to tell.

738
00:43:19,969 --> 00:43:21,800
A lot had happened.

739
00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:01,210
You came all the way here
to give me this?

740
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:04,849
It's jangjorim
and a few side dishes I made.

741
00:44:04,849 --> 00:44:07,579
It's not much,
but accept my efforts.

742
00:44:07,579 --> 00:44:09,019
How is this not much?

743
00:44:09,519 --> 00:44:10,889
It's huge.

744
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:14,559
But you don't have to do this
from now on.

745
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,760
Jinhae's so far from Seoul.

746
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:20,360
I won't do it from now on.

747
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:26,139
By the way,

748
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:28,239
when we last met here,

749
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:30,809
I saw a soldier who was rushed in.

750
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:33,610
You hurriedly took him to the ER.

751
00:44:34,510 --> 00:44:35,880
Is he all right?

752
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:37,909
He's fine.

753
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:40,320
A lieutenant
needed urgent surgery...

754
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,679
on his arm he'd broken
while saving a fellow soldier.

755
00:44:43,349 --> 00:44:44,820
The prognosis is good,

756
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,659
and he's recovering fast.

757
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:48,719
Will there be any lasting effects?

758
00:44:49,219 --> 00:44:50,460
Not really.

759
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,730
You seem very concerned.

760
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:56,269
What?

761
00:44:56,269 --> 00:44:58,329
You remembered a soldier
you've never even met...

762
00:44:58,670 --> 00:45:00,369
and even asked after him.

763
00:45:05,909 --> 00:45:08,710
They're risking their lives
to defend our country.

764
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,050
They all feel like my own.

765
00:45:14,719 --> 00:45:15,780
I see.

766
00:45:30,929 --> 00:45:32,500
Bom?

767
00:45:34,469 --> 00:45:35,739
Hello.

768
00:45:38,369 --> 00:45:40,079
What are you doing here?

769
00:45:41,079 --> 00:45:44,380
My brother told me you'd been hurt,
and I got worried.

770
00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:47,750
As you can see, I'm just fine.

771
00:45:48,019 --> 00:45:49,250
You don't have to worry.

772
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:52,590
Your head's bandaged,

773
00:45:52,719 --> 00:45:53,860
and you're on an IV drip.

774
00:45:54,590 --> 00:45:56,489
You don't seem just fine.

775
00:45:57,829 --> 00:46:00,199
Accidents like this
can happen during training.

776
00:46:00,730 --> 00:46:01,829
It's nothing.

777
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,000
Take a seat.
I'll get you something to drink.

778
00:46:05,469 --> 00:46:06,500
Okay.

779
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:31,789
You made a long trip to visit.

780
00:46:33,199 --> 00:46:34,260
Thank you.

781
00:46:35,659 --> 00:46:38,570
I wondered if you got hurt...

782
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:40,269
because you gave me this.

783
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,469
You said it kept you safe.

784
00:46:43,869 --> 00:46:45,110
I'll give it back.

785
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:46,880
No. You don't have to.

786
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:51,309
It's really okay.

787
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:56,590
You'll need it more than I do.

788
00:46:57,389 --> 00:46:58,789
Keep it on you.

789
00:47:01,159 --> 00:47:02,219
And...

790
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:07,929
it suits you better.

791
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:20,280
Oh, I had a good idea. Hang on.

792
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:24,780
Stay still.

793
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:56,039
How's that?

794
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:59,210
What's wrong?
Do you feel uncomfortable?

795
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:01,679
No. I don't.

796
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:07,119
Do you like it?

797
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:10,059
Yes.

798
00:48:12,530 --> 00:48:14,699
It's really cute.

799
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:25,710
That sea otter...

800
00:48:26,010 --> 00:48:28,480
will keep you safe
until the cast comes off.

801
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:40,420
So...

802
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:42,789
my husband wants you two...

803
00:48:42,789 --> 00:48:45,389
to marry as soon as
you're discharged.

804
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:47,659
That's what I want too.

805
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:51,530
Of course,
Se Ri would need to say yes...

806
00:48:51,530 --> 00:48:53,340
when I propose to her.

807
00:48:53,739 --> 00:48:56,469
Why would you say that
when it's a given?

808
00:48:57,639 --> 00:49:00,579
You're an adult,
but you're still so naive.

809
00:49:03,449 --> 00:49:04,480
Gyeol.

810
00:49:05,349 --> 00:49:07,119
Hey. Hello, Bom.

811
00:49:07,519 --> 00:49:09,789
I thought it was you,
and I was right.

812
00:49:10,219 --> 00:49:11,619
What brings you here?

813
00:49:11,619 --> 00:49:14,559
I came to give
your brother something.

814
00:49:15,690 --> 00:49:17,989
What about you?
Did you come to see your brother?

815
00:49:19,059 --> 00:49:20,530
I visited a patient.

816
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:22,300
Did you see Lieutenant Oh Kang Soo?

817
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:25,070
Yes. I just left his room.

820
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:47,059
Ms. Ji!

821
00:49:47,719 --> 00:49:48,989
Are you a female thug?

822
00:49:53,329 --> 00:49:54,530
A thug.

823
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:57,530
He called me a female thug.

824
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:00,539
How could he say such a thing to me?

825
00:50:01,199 --> 00:50:02,769
How?

826
00:50:09,110 --> 00:50:10,780
We're closed for today.

827
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:14,619
It's me, Ms. Ji.

828
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:18,320
Gosh, Mr. Oh!

829
00:50:19,719 --> 00:50:20,760
My goodness.

830
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,699
I'm glad you're here.

831
00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:37,369
What brings you here?

(Hair Salon)

833
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:43,980
What is this?

834
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:47,820
I lost my temper and said
something too harsh earlier.

835
00:50:48,949 --> 00:50:51,420
Please accept my humble apologies.

836
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,559
May I come in for a moment?

837
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:02,929
I have something to tell you.

838
00:51:16,679 --> 00:51:18,110
What is it you want to say?

839
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:20,780
I made a slip of the tongue earlier.

840
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,150
I'm really sorry.

841
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:25,719
Please don't be mad.

842
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:30,289
You called me a female thug.

843
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:32,289
This is the first time in my life...

844
00:51:32,289 --> 00:51:34,530
that I've heard
such insulting words.

845
00:51:35,159 --> 00:51:37,400
And it was from you, of all people.

846
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:41,039
I've never imagined
that I'd hear such a thing.

847
00:51:43,639 --> 00:51:45,510
My mind went blank,

848
00:51:46,579 --> 00:51:48,110
my legs gave out,

849
00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:52,510
and I was so shocked and flustered.

850
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:56,119
I was too worked up earlier.

851
00:51:56,119 --> 00:51:59,019
It was between Ms. Kim and me,
but why were you so worked up?

852
00:51:59,019 --> 00:52:00,159
What made you so upset?

853
00:52:01,519 --> 00:52:05,059
That's because
you two are my students.

854
00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:08,099
I just want you to get along
with each other.

855
00:52:09,329 --> 00:52:10,599
Are you sure that's it?

856
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,000
Yes. Of course.

857
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,010
What else would it be?

858
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:21,079
Why did you come to
her piano academy earlier?

859
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:22,980
Actually,

860
00:52:23,610 --> 00:52:26,920
I wanted to take piano lessons,
so I went there to talk about it.

861
00:52:27,679 --> 00:52:29,820
I've always wanted to learn piano
since I was little.

862
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:31,519
But I couldn't afford it.

863
00:52:31,519 --> 00:52:33,460
There are
a lot of piano academies out there.

864
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:35,789
Why do you have to learn from her?

865
00:52:36,289 --> 00:52:39,190
It would be better
to learn from one of my students.

866
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:40,599
I could get a discount too.

867
00:52:41,329 --> 00:52:42,860
Are you sure that's why?

868
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:43,869
Yes.

869
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:48,699
Let me ask you point-blank.

870
00:52:49,739 --> 00:52:51,670
Is there something going on
between you and Ms. Kim?

871
00:52:54,510 --> 00:52:57,610
There's a rumor about you two
going around the students.

872
00:52:58,150 --> 00:53:00,079
I want to hear it from you directly.

873
00:53:02,349 --> 00:53:04,250
Are you and Ms. Kim dating?

874
00:53:09,090 --> 00:53:12,889
Gosh, no. That's absurd.

875
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:14,400
Are you sure?

876
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,300
Of course. It's a false rumor.

877
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:18,099
That's ridiculous.

878
00:53:31,409 --> 00:53:33,920
Gosh, I feel completely drained.

879
00:53:36,050 --> 00:53:37,449
Why did I lie?

880
00:53:39,849 --> 00:53:43,019
I think there's something going on
between Ms. Kim and me.

I'm on the bus now.

You didn't forget about
the school reunion today, did you?

If you don't come, I'm not going.

886

You have to come.

887
00:54:15,159 --> 00:54:16,159
Okay?

888
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:19,230
All right.

889
00:54:19,530 --> 00:54:22,159
I'll tell them
we'll be about 30 minutes late.

890
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:23,769
Okay.

891
00:54:25,469 --> 00:54:27,400
- Hello.
- Hey.

892
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:28,969
I'm not late, right?

893
00:54:29,070 --> 00:54:30,269
You're right on time.

894
00:54:31,369 --> 00:54:32,739
I guess you're going somewhere nice.

895
00:54:33,809 --> 00:54:35,840
I have a reunion
with my elementary school friends.

I think it's been ten years
since I last saw them.

897
00:54:38,710 --> 00:54:40,679
That's why
you're all dressed up today.

898
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:42,579
Can you tell I'm dressed up?

899
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:44,820
You look great with your makeup on.

900
00:54:44,889 --> 00:54:46,320
You look ten years younger.

901
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:47,989
I'm meeting friends
after a long time,

902
00:54:47,989 --> 00:54:49,690
so I don't want to look like
I've been through a lot.

903
00:54:50,090 --> 00:54:51,460
I'm wearing a full face of makeup.

904
00:54:58,929 --> 00:55:02,900
(Daeheung Group Chairman Jang
announces his marriage.)

905
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:11,880
Hello.

906
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:14,119
I guess you're stuck in traffic.

907
00:55:14,719 --> 00:55:16,519
Ha Ni and I are waiting.

908
00:55:16,519 --> 00:55:18,920
I'm sorry. I lost track of time.

909
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:21,059
I'm leaving now. I'm sorry.

910
00:55:40,179 --> 00:55:42,380
Hello? It's me.

911
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:43,809
Are you at school now?

912
00:55:43,949 --> 00:55:46,050
No. I just got home.

913
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:47,920
I was going to tell you in person,

914
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:49,019
but I'll just do it over the phone.

915
00:55:49,619 --> 00:55:52,420
Are you interested
in being Professor Oh's TA?

916
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:54,219
Me?

917
00:55:54,519 --> 00:55:55,920
You babysat his daughter
the other day.

918
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,659
You're acquainted with him.

919
00:55:58,590 --> 00:56:00,599
Well, that's true.

920
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:02,159
It's nothing difficult.

921
00:56:02,159 --> 00:56:04,969
You just need to find materials
for his lecture...

922
00:56:04,969 --> 00:56:06,500
and help him write
his research papers.

923
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:07,940
What do you think?

924
00:56:08,469 --> 00:56:09,869
Then...

925
00:56:11,809 --> 00:56:12,909
I'll give it a try.

926
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:17,909
I could take the bus.

927
00:56:18,349 --> 00:56:21,119
I hope I'm not bothering you.

928
00:56:22,119 --> 00:56:23,179
Don't be silly.

929
00:56:23,519 --> 00:56:25,590
Between the two of us,
this should be no problem.

930
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:27,989
I mean, you're like my daughter.

931
00:56:29,489 --> 00:56:30,860
Thank you for saying that.

932
00:56:31,230 --> 00:56:33,329
I'm grateful that you take good care
of my brother too.

933
00:56:33,329 --> 00:56:35,460
And Gyeol is like my son.

934
00:56:37,070 --> 00:56:38,070
By the way,

935
00:56:38,929 --> 00:56:42,340
what made you come
all the way here to visit him?

936
00:56:43,139 --> 00:56:44,139
Oh, well...

937
00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:46,710
You must've heard it from Se Ri.

938
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:50,809
I was being stalked recently.

939
00:56:51,610 --> 00:56:53,579
Yes, I heard.

940
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:56,849
He's the one who saved me.

941
00:56:58,150 --> 00:57:00,019
He's Lieutenant Oh Kang Soo.

942
00:57:00,019 --> 00:57:01,719
He's a Navy SEAL.

943
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:03,829
I see.

944
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:07,059
He saved you back then?

945
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:08,960
Yes.

946
00:57:10,769 --> 00:57:12,130
I see.

947
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:15,869
Then Se Ri must've seen him too.

948
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:17,070
Sure.

949
00:57:17,869 --> 00:57:20,739
I was worried when I heard
he had an accident during training,

950
00:57:21,210 --> 00:57:23,610
but fortunately,
the injury wasn't too bad.

951
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:26,210
I'm so relieved.

952
00:57:39,489 --> 00:57:40,630
Goodbye, sir.

953
00:57:52,739 --> 00:57:54,210
Where shall I take you, sir?

954
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,039
I'm going home.

955
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:57,280
Yes, sir.

956
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:01,119
Oh, right. By the way,

957
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:03,519
the owner of Eagle Brewery
left a box of makgeolli...

958
00:58:03,949 --> 00:58:06,019
in the trunk for you to drink.

959
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:10,760
Why did you take it
without asking me?

960
00:58:11,230 --> 00:58:14,000
I remembered
you receiving makgeolli from her...

961
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,800
as a gift the other day.

962
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:17,369
I'm sorry, sir.

963
00:58:18,269 --> 00:58:19,329
Turn the car around.

964
00:58:20,570 --> 00:58:22,099
Yes, sir.

965
00:58:27,079 --> 00:58:29,510
(Pain relief patch)

966
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:36,579
Wait.

967
00:58:37,449 --> 00:58:38,650
Are you in pain?

968
00:58:40,119 --> 00:58:43,119
I think I sprained my back
while I was looking after Ha Ni.

969
00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:47,159
By the way,
thank you for the other day.

970
00:58:48,329 --> 00:58:50,699
You looked after Ha Ni
and put her to sleep.

971
00:58:51,429 --> 00:58:53,469
If it weren't for you,
I might've been...

972
00:58:53,739 --> 00:58:56,269
lying sick in bed by now.

973
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:58,639
It's no big deal.

974
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:01,210
Your babysitting skills
were excellent.

975
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:03,480
I guess you were a doting father.

976
00:59:10,619 --> 00:59:12,590
What? I'm not done talking.

977
00:59:13,190 --> 00:59:16,659
I just can't treat him nicely.

978
00:59:27,170 --> 00:59:28,739
(Eagle Brewery)

979
00:59:35,010 --> 00:59:37,510
Kwang Sook, hey.

980
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:39,909
Wake up, will you?

981
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:42,719
That hurts.

982
00:59:42,820 --> 00:59:44,690
I can't believe I was happy
when I gave birth to you.

983
00:59:44,690 --> 00:59:45,690
Wake up!

984
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:02,400
What brings you here?

985
01:00:04,269 --> 01:00:06,210
I'm here to see your daughter.

986
01:00:06,869 --> 01:00:08,110
My daughter?

987
01:00:08,679 --> 01:00:09,780
Ma Kwang Sook?

988
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:11,380
That's right.

989
01:00:11,610 --> 01:00:14,250
Where is she now?

990
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:16,380
(Pot Number)

991
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:17,489
CEO Ma.

992
01:00:18,119 --> 01:00:19,389
Someone's here to see you.

993
01:00:20,619 --> 01:00:21,789
CEO Ma.

994
01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:28,929
Chairman Han, what brings you
all the way out here?

995
01:00:30,869 --> 01:00:32,099
(Eagle Brewery)

996
01:00:32,599 --> 01:00:33,630
Here you go.

997
01:00:33,769 --> 01:00:35,099
Why would you...

998
01:00:35,170 --> 01:00:37,110
(Eagle Brewery)

999
01:00:40,010 --> 01:00:41,039
Hello.

1000
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:47,780
There's no reason...

1001
01:00:48,619 --> 01:00:52,349
for me to accept this
on a personal note.

1002
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:54,460
Sorry?

1003
01:00:54,460 --> 01:00:56,519
This is a professional relationship
with you being a supplier,

1004
01:00:56,519 --> 01:00:58,190
and I can't accept this.

1005
01:01:00,289 --> 01:01:02,300
For a second,
I thought you meant something else.

1006
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:06,070
You enjoyed Jang-Kwang Makgeolli...

1007
01:01:06,429 --> 01:01:09,340
and then put your trust
in a small brewery like ours.

1008
01:01:10,099 --> 01:01:12,010
I was only showing my appreciation.

1009
01:01:12,010 --> 01:01:13,710
I understand your intention,

1010
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:15,780
but this could lead to
misunderstandings,

1011
01:01:16,139 --> 01:01:18,050
so please refrain yourself.

1012
01:01:19,579 --> 01:01:20,750
Sir, come on.

1013
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:22,480
It didn't cost me extra money,

1014
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:25,550
and all I did was share some
of our makgeolli with you.

1015
01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:27,659
What is there to be misunderstood?

1016
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:31,989
I must be saying it too nicely
for it to get through to you.

1017
01:01:32,659 --> 01:01:34,460
Don't you know...

1018
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:36,699
that receiving something on the side
from a supplier for no reason...

1019
01:01:36,699 --> 01:01:37,699
is considered a bribe?

1020
01:01:39,829 --> 01:01:41,039
"A bribe?"

1021
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:44,010
What a nasty word.

1022
01:01:44,010 --> 01:01:46,539
Delivering on time with no issue
and maintaining quality...

1023
01:01:46,639 --> 01:01:48,739
is enough to show your gratitude.

1024
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:51,010
So never give me any gifts again.

1025
01:01:52,550 --> 01:01:54,219
Then, I'll get going.

1026
01:02:00,690 --> 01:02:01,690
My gosh.

1027
01:02:05,690 --> 01:02:08,130
A chairman? Of what company?

1028
01:02:09,159 --> 01:02:10,570
LX Hotel.

1029
01:02:11,829 --> 01:02:13,429
What? My goodness.

1030
01:02:14,039 --> 01:02:15,500
The chairman of LX Hotel?

1031
01:02:16,099 --> 01:02:17,570
Did someone of that caliber...

1032
01:02:17,570 --> 01:02:19,409
just visit this humble brewery?

1033
01:02:23,949 --> 01:02:25,179
Hold on a second!

1034
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:30,280
Who are you...

1035
01:02:30,349 --> 01:02:32,920
to paint someone innocent
as a briber?

1036
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:35,420
Don't you think
you're too stuck-up about things?

1037
01:02:37,090 --> 01:02:39,059
My personality isn't the issue.

1038
01:02:39,190 --> 01:02:41,159
The issue lies with
your attitude and actions.

1039
01:02:42,059 --> 01:02:43,699
I'll warn you one last time.

1040
01:02:44,030 --> 01:02:46,329
Should anything like this
happen again,

1041
01:02:46,829 --> 01:02:49,099
I'll cancel the contract
with you as a supplier.

1042
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:51,440
What?

1043
01:02:51,710 --> 01:02:53,269
I warned you loud and clear.

1044
01:02:53,639 --> 01:02:55,380
I'll cancel the contract.

1045
01:02:57,449 --> 01:02:59,380
(Eagle Brewery)

1046
01:03:45,389 --> 01:03:47,900
(For Eagle Brothers)

1047
01:03:48,199 --> 01:03:51,369
How could you be that naive
and take his words at face value?

1048
01:03:51,369 --> 01:03:53,969
Give and take
is the basic rule of business.

1049
01:03:54,070 --> 01:03:56,369
If you're that jealous,
get divorced too.

1050
01:03:56,469 --> 01:03:59,010
That jerk had an affair
with his young secretary.

1051
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:02,409
I was the fool
for not noticing it for ten years.

1052
01:04:02,610 --> 01:04:04,210
Don't be ridiculous!

1053
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:06,179
I'll ask you one last thing.

1054
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:07,880
Are you sure you didn't come back
to Korea for me?

1055
01:04:08,119 --> 01:04:10,619
The CEO of the brewery is a beauty.

1056
01:04:10,789 --> 01:04:14,059
Shouldn't an aspiring artist
like yourself have better taste?

1057
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:16,989
As if anyone would say
she's a beauty.
