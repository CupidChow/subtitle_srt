1
00:00:01,906 --> 00:00:03,406
You're not getting in, Dong Seok?

2
00:00:03,836 --> 00:00:05,246
I am.

3
00:00:21,456 --> 00:00:24,356
(Eagle Brewery)

4
00:00:50,256 --> 00:00:51,386
Dong Seok?

5
00:00:54,926 --> 00:00:56,256
Dong Seok, do you...

6
00:00:57,926 --> 00:00:59,466
have a sister I didn't know about?

7
00:01:01,526 --> 00:01:02,536
That's...

8
00:01:04,066 --> 00:01:05,806
- You see... - Save it.

9
00:01:06,436 --> 00:01:08,506
I'm jet-lagged...

10
00:01:08,636 --> 00:01:10,076
and will hear it some other time.

11
00:01:10,206 --> 00:01:11,576
Thanks for everything today.

12
00:01:12,176 --> 00:01:13,446
Get some rest.

13
00:01:17,446 --> 00:01:18,446
My room key.

14
00:01:18,446 --> 00:01:19,446
Oh, right.

15
00:01:37,036 --> 00:01:39,466
I bet you were flustered by what just happened.

16
00:01:41,266 --> 00:01:42,406
A little bit.

17
00:01:42,806 --> 00:01:45,176
Who was that lady?

18
00:01:48,276 --> 00:01:49,446
My mother-in-law.

19
00:01:50,346 --> 00:01:52,016
I figured as much.

20
00:01:53,616 --> 00:01:55,586
You said she lived in the US.

21
00:01:55,586 --> 00:01:57,556
She must be here to visit.

22
00:01:57,616 --> 00:01:58,656
Yes.

23
00:01:58,926 --> 00:02:02,056
She flies out to Korea once a year to see her grandchildren.

24
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:05,996
I'm sorry I ran my mouth.

25
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:10,796
Well, you know,

26
00:02:10,796 --> 00:02:13,566
I was going to tell her about you anyway.

27
00:02:14,106 --> 00:02:15,176
It's for the best.

28
00:02:15,606 --> 00:02:18,306
We're having dinner with my kids later today,

29
00:02:18,306 --> 00:02:19,846
so I'll fill her in then.

30
00:02:21,476 --> 00:02:23,216
She could get upset...

31
00:02:23,216 --> 00:02:25,216
since this is her late daughter's family.

32
00:02:27,546 --> 00:02:29,586
It's been a while since she passed,

33
00:02:30,716 --> 00:02:33,726
and my mother-in-law has been encouraging me...

34
00:02:33,726 --> 00:02:35,296
to meet someone new.

35
00:02:35,996 --> 00:02:37,256
I'm sure...

36
00:02:37,556 --> 00:02:40,226
she's been preparing herself for this day.

37
00:02:42,096 --> 00:02:45,766
I only caught a glimpse of her, but she seemed elegant, classy,

38
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,136
and stylish.

39
00:02:50,076 --> 00:02:53,446
She's very strict with herself when it comes to looking her best.

40
00:02:56,216 --> 00:02:57,276
My late wife...

41
00:02:57,976 --> 00:02:59,986
was given a hard time...

42
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:04,256
by her unreasonable mother-in-law before she eventually passed away.

43
00:03:04,756 --> 00:03:06,356
Because of that,

44
00:03:07,256 --> 00:03:09,126
I've always felt like I owed her mother.

45
00:03:11,196 --> 00:03:14,796
That's why I always feel intimidated...

46
00:03:15,026 --> 00:03:16,796
around her.

47
00:03:19,136 --> 00:03:21,006
It's been a while since she visited,

48
00:03:21,006 --> 00:03:23,876
so please treat her as well as you can.

49
00:03:25,546 --> 00:03:26,646
Of course.

50
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:30,876
Welcome.

51
00:03:32,386 --> 00:03:33,446
Professor.

52
00:03:38,556 --> 00:03:39,856
I already ordered for us.

53
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:42,696
Thanks. Did you come from home?

54
00:03:42,996 --> 00:03:43,996
Yes.

55
00:03:45,666 --> 00:03:48,666
Things are still cold and tense between my parents.

56
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:51,866
They've argued before,

57
00:03:51,866 --> 00:03:54,206
but never to this extent.

58
00:03:56,906 --> 00:03:58,746
I guess they're really considering divorce.

59
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:03,416
I suppose you'll have to step up as a mediator now.

60
00:04:05,316 --> 00:04:07,646
Anyway, I said I'd treat you to something nice.

61
00:04:07,646 --> 00:04:08,686
How was naengmyeon your choice?

62
00:04:09,056 --> 00:04:10,056
You know I'm particular...

63
00:04:10,056 --> 00:04:11,516
when it comes to Pyongyang naengmyeon.

64
00:04:11,986 --> 00:04:13,026
I do.

65
00:04:13,156 --> 00:04:15,456
The first thing we ate together was naengmyeon.

66
00:04:15,496 --> 00:04:18,896
There's a rule. This must be enjoyed for its subtle and clean flavors.

67
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:21,696
That's a no to vinegar or mustard.

68
00:04:22,336 --> 00:04:24,296
I should eat it however I like.

69
00:04:24,296 --> 00:04:25,536
Why should I follow some rule?

70
00:04:30,406 --> 00:04:32,176
- Here's your naengmyeon. - Right.

71
00:04:33,746 --> 00:04:35,476
- Thank you. - No problem.

72
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:37,246
Thank you.

73
00:04:38,146 --> 00:04:39,516
- Please enjoy. - Thanks.

74
00:04:45,726 --> 00:04:47,226
Wait. Me too.

75
00:04:57,866 --> 00:04:59,106
I'd like to add some in too.

76
00:05:04,236 --> 00:05:06,046
I see that we've developed a similar palate.

77
00:05:06,846 --> 00:05:08,006
I know.

78
00:05:11,946 --> 00:05:12,986
This looks great.

79
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:14,786
Yes, I know I'll enjoy this.

80
00:05:22,826 --> 00:05:23,826
What?

81
00:05:43,446 --> 00:05:44,616
Enjoy.

82
00:05:51,186 --> 00:05:54,056
I sometimes wonder...

83
00:05:55,356 --> 00:05:56,856
if I'm allowed to do this.

84
00:05:58,196 --> 00:05:59,966
You quit your postgrad degree,

85
00:06:00,096 --> 00:06:01,896
and your parents are drifting apart.

86
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:04,996
You lost a lot because of me,

87
00:06:05,836 --> 00:06:08,466
and I'm not sure if I should ignore what's going on.

88
00:06:11,636 --> 00:06:14,946
I lost some things, but I gained a lot too.

89
00:06:17,246 --> 00:06:18,686
I met Ha Ni,

90
00:06:19,016 --> 00:06:21,286
and I got to know your family.

91
00:06:22,286 --> 00:06:25,286
I got pretty close to Lieutenant Oh.

92
00:06:27,126 --> 00:06:30,596
Yes. Kang Soo seems to care about you a lot.

93
00:06:31,126 --> 00:06:33,526
He does. He was really worried about me.

94
00:06:34,996 --> 00:06:38,536
He tried really hard to get you and me to date.

95
00:06:39,606 --> 00:06:40,666
He did.

96
00:06:42,436 --> 00:06:45,546
How would you feel if you had a brother like Kang Soo?

97
00:06:47,906 --> 00:06:49,146
He's handsome,

98
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:51,776
kind, and warmhearted.

99
00:06:52,486 --> 00:06:53,846
I'd love it.

100
00:07:03,126 --> 00:07:05,766
(CEO Dokgo Tak)

101
00:07:06,196 --> 00:07:07,196
Come in.

102
00:07:09,266 --> 00:07:12,166
Mr. Oh Beom Soo is here to see you.

103
00:07:13,536 --> 00:07:16,336
- Who? - He said his name was Oh Beom Soo.

104
00:07:18,176 --> 00:07:19,246
Let him in.

105
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:31,816
Are you gutsy or shameless?

106
00:07:32,356 --> 00:07:33,656
What are you doing here?

107
00:07:33,756 --> 00:07:35,396
I came to ask for a favor.

108
00:07:35,926 --> 00:07:36,996
A favor?

109
00:07:38,726 --> 00:07:39,796
Okay.

110
00:07:40,466 --> 00:07:42,536
Let's hear what it is.

111
00:07:50,676 --> 00:07:53,106
I heard you knew about Kang Soo's birth mother.

112
00:07:54,176 --> 00:07:55,176
So what?

113
00:07:55,176 --> 00:07:57,016
For both Se Ri and Kang Soo's sake,

114
00:07:57,446 --> 00:07:59,616
wouldn't it be best to keep it a secret?

115
00:08:02,686 --> 00:08:05,256
Did you meet my wife?

116
00:08:05,656 --> 00:08:08,326
Yes. Se Ri's mother told me about it.

117
00:08:09,126 --> 00:08:10,596
"Se Ri's mother?"

118
00:08:12,066 --> 00:08:13,396
My gosh.

119
00:08:14,496 --> 00:08:16,796
You called her "Ms. Jang."

120
00:08:16,936 --> 00:08:18,436
You address her differently now.

121
00:08:18,836 --> 00:08:20,236
I don't want...

122
00:08:20,406 --> 00:08:22,536
Se Ri or Kang Soo to feel confused.

123
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:24,506
You must keep the secret.

124
00:08:24,836 --> 00:08:25,906
Please, sir.

125
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:31,416
Hey.

126
00:08:32,586 --> 00:08:35,916
Don't you think this is all your fault?

127
00:08:38,856 --> 00:08:41,556
If you hadn't seduced my daughter,

128
00:08:41,586 --> 00:08:44,196
you and I wouldn't have crossed paths,

129
00:08:44,226 --> 00:08:46,826
and I wouldn't have discovered the secret.

130
00:08:47,566 --> 00:08:49,666
Because you went and did something stupid,

131
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:52,406
my family might end up getting torn apart.

132
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:53,406
Do you get that?

133
00:09:01,776 --> 00:09:03,376
You asked me for a favor,

134
00:09:04,546 --> 00:09:06,016
so I'll ask you one too.

135
00:09:14,156 --> 00:09:15,496
Dump Se Ri.

136
00:09:16,196 --> 00:09:18,326
Then I'll keep the secret.

137
00:09:19,566 --> 00:09:20,896
I can't do that.

138
00:09:21,596 --> 00:09:22,596
What?

139
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:24,866
Let me make something very clear.

140
00:09:25,406 --> 00:09:27,836
I will not give up on Se Ri first.

141
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:32,706
I have a duty to love and protect her.

142
00:09:32,776 --> 00:09:34,776
How dare you?

143
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:38,546
Who are you to love and protect my daughter?

144
00:09:38,646 --> 00:09:41,216
That's my job as her father!

145
00:09:43,786 --> 00:09:45,626
If you love your daughter that much,

146
00:09:47,186 --> 00:09:50,426
I'd like you to really think about what you should do...

147
00:09:51,156 --> 00:09:52,926
to make her happy.

148
00:09:53,866 --> 00:09:56,536
That's why I'm asking you to keep quiet...

149
00:09:57,236 --> 00:09:58,266
about who Kang Soo's mother is.

150
00:10:09,176 --> 00:10:10,676
I'll see myself out.

151
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:20,986
Darn that punk.

152
00:10:28,726 --> 00:10:30,096
Chun Soo...

153
00:10:31,436 --> 00:10:33,406
struggled a lot for a long time.

154
00:10:34,006 --> 00:10:36,376
He finally calmed down and settled in.

155
00:10:37,276 --> 00:10:38,476
I'd like you...

156
00:10:39,106 --> 00:10:40,646
to set him free.

157
00:10:42,546 --> 00:10:45,716
I'm asking you, one woman to another.

158
00:10:50,286 --> 00:10:51,356
The truth is,

159
00:10:52,456 --> 00:10:54,726
I don't like what I'm doing either.

160
00:10:55,726 --> 00:10:57,126
Chun Soo and I...

161
00:10:57,596 --> 00:11:00,026
always argued because we had different thoughts...

162
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:01,466
and values.

163
00:11:02,466 --> 00:11:04,266
When he agreed to the divorce,

164
00:11:05,336 --> 00:11:06,706
I felt much lighter...

165
00:11:07,336 --> 00:11:09,106
and even free to some extent.

166
00:11:09,976 --> 00:11:11,036
Then...

167
00:11:11,876 --> 00:11:13,476
why do this now?

168
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:19,016
Our married life wasn't great,

169
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:21,146
so I got my satisfaction...

170
00:11:21,146 --> 00:11:22,986
from investing in Yeoung Ju.

171
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:25,516
The past ten years of suffering...

172
00:11:25,586 --> 00:11:27,356
and hard work in the US.

173
00:11:28,626 --> 00:11:31,896
I got my reward when Yeoung Ju got into an Ivy League school.

174
00:11:34,096 --> 00:11:36,736
But just when she got admitted, I lost everything in a scam.

175
00:11:37,466 --> 00:11:39,336
Yeoung Ju needs a degree.

176
00:11:40,206 --> 00:11:41,836
Chun Soo and I...

177
00:11:42,306 --> 00:11:45,436
will come up with Yeoung Ju's tuition somehow.

178
00:11:46,546 --> 00:11:49,346
The brewery just got over the worst financial crisis,

179
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:51,846
so I think it can be done.

180
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:56,086
That's why I'm saying this.

181
00:11:56,756 --> 00:11:59,386
You'll soon marry a hotel chairman.

182
00:12:00,526 --> 00:12:02,186
Sell the brewery...

183
00:12:02,186 --> 00:12:04,426
and guarantee your brothers-in-law a decent living.

184
00:12:04,896 --> 00:12:06,966
Let's be honest. To LX Hotel's chairman's wife,

185
00:12:06,966 --> 00:12:08,936
a business like this is chump change.

186
00:12:09,736 --> 00:12:10,896
Why do you...

187
00:12:11,566 --> 00:12:13,736
only think about your situation?

(Eagle Brewery)

189
00:12:28,116 --> 00:12:29,216
What are you doing here?

190
00:12:31,386 --> 00:12:33,156
Are you talking nonsense again?

191
00:12:33,426 --> 00:12:34,756
No, I'm not.

192
00:12:34,926 --> 00:12:36,456
Why do you always blame me?

193
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:37,756
As if you're not.

194
00:12:38,656 --> 00:12:40,726
What could you possibly say to her?

195
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,706
We didn't say much.

196
00:12:46,806 --> 00:12:51,306
We just exchanged our opinions.

197
00:12:54,576 --> 00:12:55,716
Well, I'll step out...

198
00:12:56,216 --> 00:12:59,116
so you two can talk freely.

199
00:13:11,026 --> 00:13:12,226
Hi, Yeoung Ju.

200
00:13:14,526 --> 00:13:16,236
Why would you fly over?

201
00:13:18,936 --> 00:13:20,336
If you don't come back right away,

202
00:13:20,336 --> 00:13:22,166
I'll fly back instead of going to university.

203
00:13:22,806 --> 00:13:24,036
Have you lost your mind?

204
00:13:24,506 --> 00:13:26,246
You'll quit university and come here?

205
00:13:26,246 --> 00:13:27,806
Why would you do that?

206
00:13:27,846 --> 00:13:28,876
Give me the phone.

207
00:13:32,386 --> 00:13:33,616
Yeoung Ju, it's Dad.

208
00:13:34,116 --> 00:13:35,386
What are you talking about?

209
00:13:35,386 --> 00:13:37,886
It really upsets me how Mom keeps pestering you.

210
00:13:38,156 --> 00:13:39,786
I think it's stupid.

211
00:13:40,456 --> 00:13:42,056
Mom won't come back...

212
00:13:42,156 --> 00:13:44,596
unless I threaten to give up going to university.

213
00:13:44,926 --> 00:13:47,226
She'll just stay there and plague you.

214
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:50,096
I get what you're saying.

215
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:52,406
I'll talk with your mom, so calm down.

216
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:54,336
Let's talk again soon.

217
00:13:55,466 --> 00:13:56,506
Bye.

218
00:13:59,346 --> 00:14:01,006
I worked so hard...

219
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,646
to get her into that university.

220
00:14:03,146 --> 00:14:05,216
She can't say she won't go. That's just nuts.

221
00:14:05,216 --> 00:14:08,386
Right, so stop being stubborn.

222
00:14:08,586 --> 00:14:10,986
Finalize the divorce and fly back to the US.

223
00:14:11,616 --> 00:14:13,586
Don't think only of yourself.

224
00:14:13,926 --> 00:14:15,686
You're ruining Yeoung Ju's future too.

225
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:18,926
You might lose everything you spent the last ten years on.

(3H Acupressure Bed)

227
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,306
We'll have it delivered...

228
00:14:26,406 --> 00:14:29,506
to your residence on the day you want, so please wait.

229
00:14:29,706 --> 00:14:30,776
Okay.

230
00:14:30,876 --> 00:14:32,076
Thank you. Goodbye.

231
00:14:32,076 --> 00:14:33,206
- Bye. - Take care.

232
00:14:35,376 --> 00:14:37,446
(3H Acupressure Bed)

233
00:14:38,016 --> 00:14:39,216
Hello.

234
00:14:40,846 --> 00:14:42,086
Welcome, Mr. Go.

235
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:45,256
I rushed over during my shift because you said it was urgent.

236
00:14:45,256 --> 00:14:46,326
What's this about?

237
00:14:47,156 --> 00:14:48,186
Take a seat.

238
00:14:54,626 --> 00:14:56,896
I was going to ignore it because it wounded my pride,

239
00:14:57,766 --> 00:14:58,966
but I can't do that anymore.

240
00:15:05,706 --> 00:15:07,076
I'll ask you directly.

241
00:15:08,406 --> 00:15:10,776
Where did you stay the night you proposed to your blind date?

242
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:11,816
Did you crash somewhere else?

243
00:15:12,076 --> 00:15:13,116
Did I crash somewhere else?

244
00:15:13,116 --> 00:15:14,786
I called until after midnight, and you didn't pick up.

245
00:15:15,346 --> 00:15:18,086
Oh, I didn't sleep elsewhere.

246
00:15:18,216 --> 00:15:20,986
We watched a late-night movie, so I got back pretty late.

247
00:15:22,156 --> 00:15:23,726
You watched a late-night movie?

248
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:26,296
Does that mean she accepted your proposal?

249
00:15:26,296 --> 00:15:29,236
Yes. We decided to become an official couple.

250
00:15:29,296 --> 00:15:30,936
- Take it back. - What?

251
00:15:31,936 --> 00:15:33,936
Take back the proposal.

252
00:15:34,706 --> 00:15:35,736
What for?

253
00:15:43,246 --> 00:15:44,646
Forget about her.

254
00:15:51,286 --> 00:15:52,526
Go out with me.

255
00:15:54,326 --> 00:15:55,326
What?

256
00:15:55,586 --> 00:15:58,096
I made up my mind when we danced the tango at Golden Castle.

257
00:15:58,326 --> 00:15:59,826
That I would go out with you.

258
00:16:00,096 --> 00:16:01,926
What do you think?

259
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,536
Well... I don't know.

260
00:16:06,836 --> 00:16:10,006
You are five years older than me.

261
00:16:10,976 --> 00:16:14,146
A five-year age difference is no big deal.

262
00:16:14,146 --> 00:16:16,446
There are many couples with age gaps of more than ten years.

263
00:16:16,446 --> 00:16:20,246
And you are my boss' mother.

264
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:22,116
Why does it even matter?

265
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:24,216
I'm old enough to date someone...

266
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:26,286
without my daughter's permission.

267
00:16:26,426 --> 00:16:28,486
Besides, while you are elegant,

268
00:16:28,486 --> 00:16:29,796
I'm just like this.

269
00:16:29,796 --> 00:16:31,056
You're not wrong about that,

270
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:33,326
but I, Gong Ju Sil,

271
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,796
am okay with it.

272
00:16:38,236 --> 00:16:39,606
If that's...

273
00:16:41,906 --> 00:16:43,776
what you want, Mrs. Gong...

274
00:16:49,516 --> 00:16:50,646
I'm in.

275
00:17:22,946 --> 00:17:23,946
Heung Soo.

276
00:17:25,146 --> 00:17:27,886
Hey. What are you doing here?

277
00:17:31,456 --> 00:17:33,356
I brought some snacks.

278
00:17:33,356 --> 00:17:34,556
Have some.

279
00:17:35,426 --> 00:17:38,126
You didn't have to do this. It must've been a lot of work.

280
00:17:38,526 --> 00:17:40,526
Not at all.

281
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:42,836
You are appearing on TV after a long time,

282
00:17:42,966 --> 00:17:44,836
so this is the least I can do...

283
00:17:44,836 --> 00:17:46,266
as the former president of your fan club.

284
00:17:48,806 --> 00:17:50,006
Hey, Jin Young.

285
00:17:50,676 --> 00:17:51,776
Hey.

286
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:55,106
Hello.

287
00:17:56,376 --> 00:17:57,416
Who is she?

288
00:17:57,476 --> 00:17:58,516
What?

289
00:18:09,026 --> 00:18:10,156
My girlfriend.

290
00:18:10,296 --> 00:18:13,026
- Hey. - Good for you.

291
00:18:16,966 --> 00:18:18,066
Heung Soo.

292
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:25,806
Please take good care of my boyfriend.

293
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:29,006
I brought some snacks you can eat...

294
00:18:29,346 --> 00:18:31,046
after the rehearsal.

295
00:18:31,046 --> 00:18:32,146
My goodness.

296
00:18:32,786 --> 00:18:36,156
Are you assisting your future husband already?

297
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:39,386
My goodness.

298
00:18:39,386 --> 00:18:41,256
It's not like that.

299
00:19:03,216 --> 00:19:04,416
I'll see you tomorrow.

300
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:13,026
Did your sister-in-law tell you?

301
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,126
A few days ago,

302
00:19:15,126 --> 00:19:17,796
I met her with Dad and Gyeol.

303
00:19:18,826 --> 00:19:19,826
I see.

304
00:19:20,266 --> 00:19:22,626
I thought she was different from the image I had in mind,

305
00:19:22,626 --> 00:19:24,236
so I was a little flustered at first,

306
00:19:26,036 --> 00:19:27,306
but she seems like a nice person.

307
00:19:27,606 --> 00:19:31,106
You say you think of her as your older sister.

308
00:19:31,306 --> 00:19:32,976
Now, I understand what you mean.

309
00:19:33,976 --> 00:19:36,976
I see. You will feel that way even more over time.

310
00:19:39,146 --> 00:19:40,986
By the way, are you not going home?

311
00:19:41,486 --> 00:19:43,916
You go ahead. I have some materials to go through.

312
00:19:44,856 --> 00:19:46,526
My grandmother is visiting from the US,

313
00:19:46,526 --> 00:19:48,386
so my family is having dinner together.

314
00:19:48,426 --> 00:19:49,596
I should get going.

315
00:19:49,826 --> 00:19:51,426
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

316
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:55,796
By the way, Kang Soo,

317
00:19:57,236 --> 00:19:59,406
is there anything that's bothering you?

318
00:20:01,836 --> 00:20:04,436
You've been looking a bit down.

319
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:08,646
I'll tell you later when I have the chance.

320
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:12,276
Okay. Tell me when you're ready.

321
00:20:23,796 --> 00:20:25,456
Make up your mind first.

322
00:20:26,326 --> 00:20:28,226
Once you know what you want for sure,

323
00:20:28,996 --> 00:20:30,296
I'll tell you then.

324
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:35,706
So it's someone Beom Soo knows.

325
00:20:46,295 --> 00:20:48,835
Did you tell Beom Soo that I know...

326
00:20:49,605 --> 00:20:50,865
Kang Soo is your son?

327
00:20:51,775 --> 00:20:53,075
I did. Why?

328
00:20:54,575 --> 00:20:56,645
Are you already hand-in-glove with him?

329
00:20:56,805 --> 00:20:58,315
Watch what you say!

330
00:21:00,715 --> 00:21:02,285
If Se Ri finds out,

331
00:21:02,815 --> 00:21:05,155
Beom Soo will be the only one who can calm her down.

332
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:08,785
And he's the only one in his family...

333
00:21:08,785 --> 00:21:11,695
who knows that Kang Soo is my son.

334
00:21:11,695 --> 00:21:14,255
The fact that he is meddling in my family's business...

335
00:21:14,255 --> 00:21:15,925
makes me feel uncomfortable and upset.

336
00:21:15,925 --> 00:21:18,495
- I'm just doing this for Se Ri... - Stop making excuses!

337
00:21:19,365 --> 00:21:20,995
I'm Se Ri's father.

338
00:21:20,995 --> 00:21:24,365
I'm just as worried and heartbroken about her as you are.

339
00:21:26,175 --> 00:21:27,905
Will you please stop that?

340
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:31,645
Mom, Dad. I hate it when you do this.

341
00:21:32,315 --> 00:21:34,045
You are at each other's throat all the time.

342
00:21:34,045 --> 00:21:35,245
What kind of family is that?

343
00:21:37,785 --> 00:21:39,615
Do you want me to leave home again?

344
00:21:40,955 --> 00:21:43,185
No! You can never do that.

345
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:45,295
If this is what you're going to do, you should just get a divorce.

346
00:21:46,655 --> 00:21:48,565
Then I can live my life the way I want...

347
00:21:48,895 --> 00:21:51,565
without worrying about you.

348
00:21:51,695 --> 00:21:53,965
What nonsense are you talking about?

349
00:21:54,365 --> 00:21:56,435
Do you think what you are doing makes sense, then?

350
00:21:58,575 --> 00:21:59,705
I'm sorry, Se Ri.

351
00:22:00,175 --> 00:22:01,645
This is all my fault.

352
00:22:09,915 --> 00:22:11,785
You are crying like this every day.

353
00:22:12,755 --> 00:22:14,855
I really hate it, and it makes me sad.

354
00:22:57,165 --> 00:22:58,335
Let's put everything behind us.

355
00:23:01,165 --> 00:23:02,235
Honey.

356
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:04,135
If we keep being like this,

357
00:23:05,805 --> 00:23:08,005
we will only end up breaking the heart of our only daughter...

358
00:23:08,205 --> 00:23:09,375
as well as mine.

359
00:23:11,845 --> 00:23:12,845
I will...

360
00:23:13,615 --> 00:23:14,915
let everything slide.

361
00:23:19,255 --> 00:23:21,415
I have one condition, though.

362
00:23:23,125 --> 00:23:24,185
What is it?

363
00:23:25,025 --> 00:23:26,295
Don't get...

364
00:23:27,855 --> 00:23:30,095
Kang Soo involved in our family's life anymore.

365
00:23:31,465 --> 00:23:32,695
I mean,

366
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,005
you shouldn't call him...

367
00:23:35,965 --> 00:23:37,235
or meet him anymore.

368
00:23:38,105 --> 00:23:39,175
Do you understand?

369
00:23:43,175 --> 00:23:44,405
Then I won't...

370
00:23:45,475 --> 00:23:47,315
bring it up again.

371
00:23:49,315 --> 00:23:50,615
I'll try...

372
00:23:52,485 --> 00:23:55,185
to forget about the whole thing.

373
00:23:58,955 --> 00:24:00,095
Are you serious?

374
00:24:02,095 --> 00:24:03,695
Of course, I am.

375
00:24:06,295 --> 00:24:07,395
If this keeps up,

376
00:24:08,235 --> 00:24:09,705
I'll be on my way to an early grave.

377
00:24:11,465 --> 00:24:14,205
It's only a matter of time before our family falls apart.

378
00:24:18,675 --> 00:24:19,715
Promise me...

379
00:24:20,475 --> 00:24:22,545
that you won't stay in touch with Kang Soo.

380
00:24:23,415 --> 00:24:24,485
Now.

381
00:24:27,855 --> 00:24:28,885
Okay.

382
00:24:30,625 --> 00:24:32,455
And I want you to keep your promise too.

383
00:24:34,425 --> 00:24:35,525
I will.

384
00:25:11,735 --> 00:25:12,735
Right.

385
00:25:16,135 --> 00:25:17,305
Thank you.

386
00:25:23,745 --> 00:25:25,515
Are you feeling refreshed?

387
00:25:25,775 --> 00:25:29,315
Yes, a massage at the hotel spa...

388
00:25:29,585 --> 00:25:31,015
worked wonders.

389
00:25:31,415 --> 00:25:32,515
I'm glad to hear that.

390
00:25:32,615 --> 00:25:34,555
Anyway, the children are on their way.

391
00:25:35,025 --> 00:25:36,085
I see.

392
00:25:42,095 --> 00:25:43,165
You see,

393
00:25:44,965 --> 00:25:48,605
I've been seeing someone lately.

394
00:25:51,035 --> 00:25:52,605
I figured as much.

395
00:25:53,735 --> 00:25:56,905
Isn't she the woman from the elevator?

396
00:25:58,345 --> 00:25:59,975
Yes, you're right.

397
00:26:01,745 --> 00:26:05,115
I can't say I was impressed by her shabby clothing.

398
00:26:05,915 --> 00:26:08,255
You caught her in her work clothes.

399
00:26:09,325 --> 00:26:10,785
What does she do?

400
00:26:11,525 --> 00:26:13,725
She runs a brewery.

401
00:26:14,395 --> 00:26:17,395
A brewery, as in a place that produces alcohol?

402
00:26:17,595 --> 00:26:18,595
That's right.

403
00:26:18,865 --> 00:26:22,105
She makes a premium brand named Jang-Kwang Makgeolli,

404
00:26:22,135 --> 00:26:24,365
and the brewery is one of the hotel's suppliers.

405
00:26:24,965 --> 00:26:26,775
You saw her earlier,

406
00:26:26,975 --> 00:26:30,905
dressed in the clothes she wears for deliveries.

407
00:26:31,205 --> 00:26:32,245
I see.

408
00:26:33,275 --> 00:26:36,115
Is she the brewer behind the liquor brand...

409
00:26:36,115 --> 00:26:38,915
that your friend's Saman Mart will introduce?

410
00:26:39,215 --> 00:26:40,815
Yes, that's the one.

411
00:26:41,485 --> 00:26:42,525
I see.

412
00:26:43,755 --> 00:26:45,055
Dong Seok.

413
00:26:45,555 --> 00:26:47,955
You're more naive than I thought.

414
00:26:49,895 --> 00:26:50,895
Sorry?

415
00:26:51,665 --> 00:26:53,965
You may not be the type to care about social status,

416
00:26:54,795 --> 00:26:56,105
but a brewery owner?

417
00:26:58,235 --> 00:26:59,275
You're not...

418
00:27:00,305 --> 00:27:02,245
considering marriage, are you?

419
00:27:08,215 --> 00:27:10,045
I have been considering it.

420
00:27:16,655 --> 00:27:19,295
It's been quite a long time...

421
00:27:20,195 --> 00:27:21,765
since my wife passed away.

422
00:27:22,665 --> 00:27:25,895
Since then, I've dedicated myself to my work and children,

423
00:27:26,635 --> 00:27:29,205
without pursuing romantic relationships.

424
00:27:30,265 --> 00:27:32,405
Because of that, the children grew up well...

425
00:27:33,175 --> 00:27:34,875
and have now started their own careers.

426
00:27:36,175 --> 00:27:40,115
Now, I'm ready to begin a new chapter in my life.

427
00:27:41,275 --> 00:27:42,485
I believe...

428
00:27:43,085 --> 00:27:46,885
their mother would approve of my decision.

429
00:27:51,425 --> 00:27:52,855
That's only what you think.

430
00:27:55,395 --> 00:27:57,925
As a member of society and a businessman,

431
00:27:58,795 --> 00:28:01,535
there's more to consider than just what you want.

432
00:28:02,765 --> 00:28:06,235
Shouldn't you be more careful for your children's sake?

433
00:28:07,635 --> 00:28:09,605
They have already met her.

434
00:28:10,875 --> 00:28:11,875
Is that so?

435
00:28:12,945 --> 00:28:14,915
I see you've been moving things along.

436
00:28:17,885 --> 00:28:19,655
They're not little kids anymore,

437
00:28:20,255 --> 00:28:24,085
and they've experienced a lot in life.

438
00:28:24,885 --> 00:28:27,025
There's no reason for me to hesitate,

439
00:28:27,895 --> 00:28:31,125
and I'm confident in my decision.

440
00:28:33,465 --> 00:28:36,505
This is why they say only the dead feel wronged.

441
00:28:38,105 --> 00:28:39,735
In the years she lived,

442
00:28:40,335 --> 00:28:42,175
my daughter had to endure so much.

443
00:28:46,145 --> 00:28:49,615
Being the children's grandmother,

444
00:28:49,915 --> 00:28:51,615
I can only be careful.

445
00:28:53,555 --> 00:28:55,155
I hope you can understand that.

446
00:29:00,055 --> 00:29:02,295
- Grandma! - Grandma.

447
00:29:02,295 --> 00:29:03,895
My puppies.

448
00:29:03,895 --> 00:29:07,265
Goodness me. Have you been well?

449
00:29:07,365 --> 00:29:09,365
How do you look so much younger?

450
00:29:09,365 --> 00:29:11,305
Gosh, that's so sweet of you to say.

451
00:29:11,505 --> 00:29:12,535
Thanks.

452
00:29:13,875 --> 00:29:15,675
I missed you, Grandma.

453
00:29:15,675 --> 00:29:19,345
Same here. You are the apple of my eye.

454
00:29:19,915 --> 00:29:23,015
I'm so glad you're here. Let's sit.

455
00:29:32,855 --> 00:29:35,025
What brings you here unannounced?

456
00:29:35,925 --> 00:29:37,195
Is something up?

457
00:29:37,365 --> 00:29:39,465
Do I need a reason to want to see you?

458
00:29:40,465 --> 00:29:43,605
After having dinner with the kids and my mother-in-law,

459
00:29:43,665 --> 00:29:44,905
I dropped by on my way home...

460
00:29:45,975 --> 00:29:48,675
because I wanted to see you.

461
00:29:51,305 --> 00:29:55,215
Did your conversation with your mother-in-law go well?

462
00:29:57,985 --> 00:29:59,055
Well...

463
00:30:00,555 --> 00:30:02,325
I was honest with her.

464
00:30:02,725 --> 00:30:03,855
I told her...

465
00:30:04,555 --> 00:30:05,755
I wanted to marry you.

466
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:09,525
Didn't it upset her?

467
00:30:09,895 --> 00:30:10,925
Being as smart...

468
00:30:11,995 --> 00:30:14,095
and levelheaded as she is,

469
00:30:14,535 --> 00:30:16,805
I believe she'll eventually give me her blessing.

470
00:30:19,375 --> 00:30:22,175
I can't believe I made a mistake like that.

471
00:30:22,845 --> 00:30:25,375
How could you call that a mistake?

472
00:30:25,375 --> 00:30:29,285
It felt nice hearing you address me so affectionately.

473
00:30:32,815 --> 00:30:34,255
Can you call me that again?

474
00:30:35,925 --> 00:30:36,955
My gosh.

475
00:30:38,655 --> 00:30:39,695
Forget it.

476
00:30:40,855 --> 00:30:44,025
Come on. Between dealing with my mother-in-law and work,

477
00:30:44,125 --> 00:30:46,265
it's been an exhausting day.

478
00:30:46,265 --> 00:30:48,865
I'm completely drained.

479
00:30:51,005 --> 00:30:53,335
Hearing you call me "sweetie..."

480
00:30:53,575 --> 00:30:55,905
will definitely recharge my battery.

481
00:31:12,025 --> 00:31:13,195
I know...

482
00:31:16,095 --> 00:31:17,265
it's been rough today,

483
00:31:18,565 --> 00:31:19,595
sweetie.

484
00:31:21,235 --> 00:31:23,305
(Eagle Brewery)

485
00:31:25,635 --> 00:31:28,275
My battery's at 50 percent now.

486
00:31:32,375 --> 00:31:33,515
Go home,

487
00:31:34,445 --> 00:31:37,045
wash up, and rest well,

488
00:31:38,685 --> 00:31:40,685
Dong Seok.

489
00:31:43,625 --> 00:31:45,455
Now, it's at 70 percent.

490
00:31:49,025 --> 00:31:50,465
I'll see you in your dreams, sweetie.

491
00:31:53,135 --> 00:31:55,635
I'm almost there. Just a little more.

492
00:32:03,805 --> 00:32:05,045
Good night, sweetie.

493
00:32:11,415 --> 00:32:12,655
Fully recharged!

494
00:32:14,655 --> 00:32:16,185
You've had a long day today.

495
00:32:16,655 --> 00:32:17,925
Rest well.

496
00:32:17,925 --> 00:32:20,755
You should get back inside now.

497
00:32:21,795 --> 00:32:22,865
Got it.

498
00:32:23,125 --> 00:32:24,125
I'll get going.

499
00:32:26,895 --> 00:32:28,805
Hop in already, sweetie.

500
00:32:29,805 --> 00:32:32,135
I'm being treated to the whole experience.

501
00:32:36,175 --> 00:32:38,545
Drive safely, sweetie.

502
00:32:45,015 --> 00:32:46,315
Bye, sweetie.

503
00:32:48,785 --> 00:32:51,185
(Eagle Brewery)

504
00:33:00,235 --> 00:33:01,365
Ha Ni.

505
00:33:06,575 --> 00:33:08,745
She's fussier than usual at bedtime today.

506
00:33:09,145 --> 00:33:10,245
She's still not sleeping.

507
00:33:11,775 --> 00:33:13,275
That sounds tough.

508
00:33:14,675 --> 00:33:16,645
I'll quickly get her to sleep and head to the convenience store.

509
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:19,615
I'm fine today, so you don't have to come.

510
00:33:19,785 --> 00:33:21,215
Don't be absurd.

511
00:33:21,715 --> 00:33:22,985
I won't be at ease...

512
00:33:22,985 --> 00:33:24,985
until I see you close up and head home.

513
00:33:26,095 --> 00:33:27,725
I'll put Ha Ni to bed...

514
00:33:27,725 --> 00:33:29,165
and rush over there. I won't be long.

515
00:33:30,125 --> 00:33:32,435
Sure. I'll be waiting, then.

516
00:33:32,995 --> 00:33:34,535
Bye, Se Ri.

517
00:33:34,935 --> 00:33:36,235
Bye, Ha Ni.

518
00:33:46,045 --> 00:33:47,515
Welcome.

519
00:33:49,915 --> 00:33:51,045
Lieutenant Oh.

520
00:33:51,885 --> 00:33:53,315
Are you just getting home from work?

521
00:33:53,585 --> 00:33:56,855
Yes, I stayed late at the office to go over some materials.

522
00:33:57,555 --> 00:33:58,555
I see.

523
00:34:03,795 --> 00:34:05,965
Ha Ni's been fussier than usual at bedtime,

524
00:34:05,965 --> 00:34:07,865
so Professor Oh is paying the price.

525
00:34:11,405 --> 00:34:12,605
Isn't she adorable?

526
00:34:14,305 --> 00:34:16,145
You must have a natural maternal side.

527
00:34:17,645 --> 00:34:20,575
I'm often pleasantly surprised by how you are with Ha Ni.

528
00:34:23,315 --> 00:34:25,485
How could anyone not love a sweetheart...

529
00:34:25,485 --> 00:34:27,155
like Ha Ni?

530
00:34:32,955 --> 00:34:34,395
There are mothers...

531
00:34:36,325 --> 00:34:37,725
who abandon their own children.

532
00:34:41,035 --> 00:34:43,165
That's something I'll never understand.

533
00:34:44,505 --> 00:34:47,035
How could you abandon the child you gave birth to?

534
00:34:47,705 --> 00:34:50,345
No matter the reason, that can never be forgiven.

535
00:34:53,615 --> 00:34:54,745
Of course.

536
00:35:08,965 --> 00:35:11,425
If I had enough money to give her,

537
00:35:11,865 --> 00:35:13,335
this could all be resolved easily.

538
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:41,055
Hello?

539
00:35:41,795 --> 00:35:44,465
It's me. Where are you right now?

540
00:35:52,905 --> 00:35:54,435
What are you doing back here?

541
00:35:54,705 --> 00:35:56,445
Please talk some sense into Yeoung Ju.

542
00:35:56,675 --> 00:35:58,405
She's threatening to fly out to Korea.

543
00:35:58,745 --> 00:36:00,415
That's only because...

544
00:36:00,415 --> 00:36:02,785
you're causing mayhem here while pretending it's for her sake.

545
00:36:04,285 --> 00:36:06,555
Yeoung Ju has been the purpose of my life.

546
00:36:06,985 --> 00:36:09,355
It's unfair to stop now after coming this far.

547
00:36:10,125 --> 00:36:13,055
She got into an Ivy League school that everyone dreams of attending.

548
00:36:13,495 --> 00:36:16,165
But she'll give that up and come to Korea?

549
00:36:16,165 --> 00:36:17,825
How absurd is that?

550
00:36:17,895 --> 00:36:18,965
That's why...

551
00:36:19,895 --> 00:36:22,565
you will quietly go back to the US tomorrow.

552
00:36:23,435 --> 00:36:26,035
Your place is with her, not out here.

553
00:36:27,335 --> 00:36:28,835
What about after that?

554
00:36:29,605 --> 00:36:30,945
What options do we have?

555
00:36:33,815 --> 00:36:35,815
How can we afford her tuition...

556
00:36:35,815 --> 00:36:37,415
that's nearly 100,000 dollars a year?

557
00:36:37,415 --> 00:36:38,585
I'm Yeoung Ju's dad.

558
00:36:39,055 --> 00:36:40,755
I'll be there for my daughter.

559
00:36:42,925 --> 00:36:44,485
Can I trust you on that?

560
00:36:44,585 --> 00:36:45,655
Trust me.

561
00:36:46,525 --> 00:36:48,855
Would I say what I don't mean when my child's future's at stake?

562
00:36:57,035 --> 00:36:59,335
I'm heartbroken.

563
00:36:59,335 --> 00:37:02,405
(Eagle Brewery)

564
00:37:02,405 --> 00:37:04,405
The peak was right ahead of me,

565
00:37:06,075 --> 00:37:07,275
but I feel like...

566
00:37:08,075 --> 00:37:10,815
I'm endlessly sliding down the cliff.

567
00:37:13,315 --> 00:37:15,455
After Yeoung Ju got into her dream school,

568
00:37:16,155 --> 00:37:18,385
I thought all my troubles...

569
00:37:18,385 --> 00:37:20,795
would finally pay off.

570
00:37:22,565 --> 00:37:24,625
Why did I have to get scammed out of my money...

571
00:37:25,165 --> 00:37:26,795
at this exact moment?

572
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:29,105
I don't understand you.

573
00:37:30,465 --> 00:37:32,135
Why did you expect to be rewarded?

574
00:37:32,835 --> 00:37:35,505
Did you devote yourself to her just to get something in return?

575
00:37:38,505 --> 00:37:40,275
So, I'll get nothing from my husband...

576
00:37:40,945 --> 00:37:43,285
and nothing from my daughter either?

577
00:37:43,285 --> 00:37:44,315
Then what about my life?

578
00:37:46,515 --> 00:37:48,115
Then what happens to my life?

579
00:37:50,985 --> 00:37:52,555
That's for you to figure out.

580
00:37:53,425 --> 00:37:55,295
Why do you seek your purpose in other people?

581
00:37:57,125 --> 00:37:58,165
Unbelievable.

582
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:01,095
You and your perfect answers.

583
00:38:21,785 --> 00:38:24,855
Take a deep breath and make a fresh start in the US.

584
00:38:25,795 --> 00:38:28,355
I'll do whatever it takes to cover Yeoung Ju's tuition.

585
00:38:30,295 --> 00:38:31,665
We still have some time.

586
00:38:58,943 --> 00:39:00,743
- I'm home. - I'm home.

587
00:39:00,743 --> 00:39:01,783
Kwang Sook.

588
00:39:02,113 --> 00:39:03,183
It's been another long day.

589
00:39:04,013 --> 00:39:06,323
Ha Ni didn't even wake up once.

590
00:39:06,323 --> 00:39:07,423
Thanks.

591
00:39:09,123 --> 00:39:12,393
Kang Soo, has it been rough at the office these days?

592
00:39:13,023 --> 00:39:15,333
Not really. Why do you say that, Kwang Sook?

593
00:39:15,863 --> 00:39:18,563
You've been looking a little down recently.

594
00:39:19,403 --> 00:39:21,073
Nothing's up, right?

595
00:39:21,703 --> 00:39:23,703
Of course not. Everything's fine.

596
00:39:26,803 --> 00:39:29,513
Guys! Hey!

597
00:39:29,513 --> 00:39:30,713
Gosh, Kwang Sook.

598
00:39:31,583 --> 00:39:33,783
I hit the jackpot.

599
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:35,953
What do you mean? Did something good happen?

600
00:39:36,213 --> 00:39:38,383
I'll be on TV next week.

601
00:39:38,883 --> 00:39:40,923
No way. On TV?

602
00:39:40,923 --> 00:39:42,553
A singer I used to work with...

603
00:39:42,553 --> 00:39:45,493
will be performing on KBC to celebrate his 35th anniversary.

604
00:39:45,663 --> 00:39:47,023
I'll be performing on stage too.

605
00:39:47,023 --> 00:39:48,063
My gosh.

606
00:39:48,893 --> 00:39:50,293
Congratulations, Heung Soo.

607
00:39:50,663 --> 00:39:51,703
Congratulations, Heung Soo.

608
00:39:51,703 --> 00:39:53,903
It's been over a decade since I was on TV.

609
00:39:53,903 --> 00:39:56,673
A few days of practice got me back in my old groove.

610
00:39:57,173 --> 00:39:59,573
Oh Heung Soo hasn't lost his touch.

611
00:40:01,873 --> 00:40:03,973
How about we have a drink to celebrate?

612
00:40:03,973 --> 00:40:04,983
Sounds good.

613
00:40:05,013 --> 00:40:07,443
A celebratory drink? What's the occasion?

614
00:40:13,583 --> 00:40:16,393
Hey. Why is he flapping around near bedtime?

615
00:40:16,753 --> 00:40:19,223
Always a party pooper. Don't you know this dance?

616
00:40:20,593 --> 00:40:22,763
Here. Doesn't this ring a bell?

617
00:40:25,763 --> 00:40:28,973
When I say "Five,"

618
00:40:29,073 --> 00:40:32,103
you'll say "Eagle Siblings."

619
00:40:32,103 --> 00:40:33,173
Got it?

620
00:40:33,543 --> 00:40:34,713
- Sounds good. - Sure.

621
00:40:34,913 --> 00:40:37,913
Here's to Heung Soo's comeback!

622
00:40:37,913 --> 00:40:39,413
Five...

623
00:40:39,413 --> 00:40:41,283
- Eagle Siblings. - Eagle Siblings.

624
00:40:49,323 --> 00:40:52,363
The makgeolli tastes like honey today, Kwang Sook.

625
00:40:53,263 --> 00:40:55,693
A big part of this comeback...

626
00:40:55,693 --> 00:40:57,293
is thanks to Ok Bun.

627
00:40:57,563 --> 00:40:59,063
Don't you forget that.

628
00:41:00,003 --> 00:41:01,973
I won the lottery with Ok Bun.

629
00:41:01,973 --> 00:41:03,373
Of course, I know that.

630
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:06,473
After I successfully wrap up this performance,

631
00:41:06,473 --> 00:41:08,013
I want to propose to her.

632
00:41:10,143 --> 00:41:11,183
That's smart of you.

633
00:41:12,143 --> 00:41:13,583
You won't find anyone else like her.

634
00:41:13,583 --> 00:41:16,913
Don't worry about me. You should take your own advice.

635
00:41:17,283 --> 00:41:19,183
You'd better not let Mi Sun slip away.

636
00:41:20,723 --> 00:41:21,753
Hey.

637
00:41:22,453 --> 00:41:24,293
Only a fool would let her get away twice.

638
00:41:29,263 --> 00:41:30,993
You seem confident.

639
00:41:33,533 --> 00:41:37,173
Kang Soo, why have you been so quiet this evening?

640
00:41:55,823 --> 00:41:58,423
Why are you crying on a good day like this?

641
00:42:01,663 --> 00:42:04,033
I just realized how happy I am.

642
00:42:05,603 --> 00:42:07,203
To be your brother.

643
00:42:08,703 --> 00:42:10,303
To be your brother-in-law.

644
00:42:11,243 --> 00:42:12,373
I'm grateful for it all.

645
00:42:14,843 --> 00:42:16,413
Thanks, guys.

646
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:26,853
Come on. That's nothing new.

647
00:42:28,693 --> 00:42:30,693
Don't tell me you're tipsy after just one drink.

648
00:42:32,693 --> 00:42:34,023
Is something going on with you?

649
00:42:34,993 --> 00:42:37,393
Of course not. Nothing's going on.

650
00:42:53,443 --> 00:42:54,443
Wait.

651
00:42:58,853 --> 00:43:00,083
Hey, Chun Soo.

652
00:43:00,153 --> 00:43:01,153
Hey.

653
00:43:01,153 --> 00:43:03,023
You didn't come by the brewery like you said you would.

654
00:43:03,553 --> 00:43:04,993
Should I head over there?

655
00:43:05,263 --> 00:43:07,723
Don't. It's pretty late anyway.

656
00:43:09,293 --> 00:43:11,163
Didn't you have something to say?

657
00:43:12,263 --> 00:43:14,673
I thought I'd stop by while getting some fresh air.

658
00:43:15,533 --> 00:43:16,773
It's all right.

659
00:43:17,603 --> 00:43:18,773
I'll see you tomorrow.

660
00:43:20,743 --> 00:43:22,713
Sure. Good night.

661
00:43:46,403 --> 00:43:47,433
Hello?

662
00:43:47,633 --> 00:43:49,033
Hello, sir. It's me.

663
00:43:54,243 --> 00:43:55,273
Hang on.

664
00:44:04,553 --> 00:44:05,853
Why are you calling this late?

665
00:44:05,983 --> 00:44:06,983
I...

666
00:44:08,253 --> 00:44:10,153
want to return to Korea.

667
00:44:10,253 --> 00:44:11,323
Are you insane?

668
00:44:11,423 --> 00:44:13,523
I miss my wife.

669
00:44:14,063 --> 00:44:15,233
And my kids.

670
00:44:16,363 --> 00:44:18,533
I miss my kids too.

671
00:44:20,603 --> 00:44:22,233
I can't do this anymore.

672
00:44:22,973 --> 00:44:24,373
I'm coming back.

673
00:44:24,843 --> 00:44:26,343
Don't be stupid.

674
00:44:27,243 --> 00:44:30,813
Don't you know the police will get you as soon as you return?

675
00:44:31,113 --> 00:44:32,813
I don't speak the language,

676
00:44:32,843 --> 00:44:35,613
and the food here isn't to my taste.

677
00:44:37,713 --> 00:44:40,753
This place is as good as a prison cell,

678
00:44:40,753 --> 00:44:44,153
just without the walls and bars.

679
00:44:45,663 --> 00:44:47,323
If I must be locked up,

680
00:44:47,693 --> 00:44:49,993
I'd rather be locked up in my home country.

681
00:44:50,833 --> 00:44:53,203
You don't know what you're talking about.

682
00:44:54,873 --> 00:44:57,633
I'll come and see you tomorrow.

683
00:44:57,633 --> 00:45:00,473
Lie low and keep quiet, okay?

684
00:45:03,073 --> 00:45:05,443
To think that I trusted him with important stuff...

685
00:45:05,443 --> 00:45:06,813
because he helped me open Silla.

686
00:45:09,513 --> 00:45:11,283
He could get me into big trouble.

687
00:45:25,103 --> 00:45:27,203
It's an overnight trip. Don't pack too much.

688
00:45:28,933 --> 00:45:32,173
Why are you suddenly flying to the Philippines?

689
00:45:34,073 --> 00:45:35,143
I'm...

690
00:45:36,373 --> 00:45:37,613
I'm meeting a buyer...

691
00:45:37,613 --> 00:45:39,683
to discuss an export deal.

692
00:45:41,043 --> 00:45:43,013
I'll take an evening flight out...

693
00:45:43,013 --> 00:45:44,413
and will return the next evening.

694
00:45:45,753 --> 00:45:47,183
Stay safe.

695
00:45:48,353 --> 00:45:49,593
You promised...

696
00:45:49,953 --> 00:45:52,163
to cut ties with Kang Soo forever.

697
00:45:54,833 --> 00:45:57,493
That's the only way to make sure...

698
00:45:57,493 --> 00:45:59,263
that neither Se Ri nor Kang Soo gets hurt.

699
00:46:01,873 --> 00:46:02,933
Okay.

700
00:46:04,033 --> 00:46:05,543
I'll do as you say.

701
00:46:16,783 --> 00:46:18,983
It's great to see that you reconciled.

702
00:46:21,353 --> 00:46:23,823
I'm glad to know you're pleased.

703
00:46:27,563 --> 00:46:29,393
Shall I drive you to the airport?

704
00:46:29,833 --> 00:46:32,003
No. I'll take care of some things at work...

705
00:46:32,003 --> 00:46:33,303
and catch the evening flight.

706
00:46:34,973 --> 00:46:36,303
- See you. - Bye.

707
00:46:41,513 --> 00:46:42,773
Take care.

708
00:46:44,373 --> 00:46:45,443
Yes?

709
00:46:47,013 --> 00:46:48,453
Are you ready for work?

710
00:46:49,453 --> 00:46:50,483
Yes.

711
00:46:52,423 --> 00:46:53,553
Kang Soo.

712
00:46:55,353 --> 00:46:56,553
Do you still want to know...

713
00:46:58,993 --> 00:47:00,663
about your birth mother?

714
00:47:04,803 --> 00:47:06,003
Half of me...

715
00:47:06,303 --> 00:47:07,603
wants to know.

716
00:47:07,933 --> 00:47:10,473
But the other half of me is scared that once I know,

717
00:47:11,303 --> 00:47:13,373
I won't be able to go back to how things were.

718
00:47:16,313 --> 00:47:17,443
Yes.

719
00:47:17,873 --> 00:47:20,343
You'd want to face her and ask...

720
00:47:20,343 --> 00:47:22,083
why she did what she did.

721
00:47:23,213 --> 00:47:25,583
But meeting her could just complicate things.

722
00:47:29,793 --> 00:47:32,993
You might not get what you were expecting,

723
00:47:33,963 --> 00:47:35,633
and you could just get hurt.

724
00:47:37,533 --> 00:47:39,133
You shouldn't let your past ruin...

725
00:47:39,303 --> 00:47:41,263
your present and future.

726
00:47:45,803 --> 00:47:47,543
As I said last time,

727
00:47:48,713 --> 00:47:51,043
tell me if you really want to know.

728
00:47:52,113 --> 00:47:53,413
I'll be waiting.

729
00:48:02,223 --> 00:48:04,023
Have you heard from the US?

730
00:48:04,053 --> 00:48:05,063
What?

731
00:48:05,423 --> 00:48:08,023
The shipment arrived safely yesterday.

732
00:48:08,093 --> 00:48:10,563
They'll go on the shelves today or tomorrow.

733
00:48:10,693 --> 00:48:12,363
I'm so excited.

734
00:48:12,963 --> 00:48:14,003
Kwang Sook.

735
00:48:14,303 --> 00:48:15,403
Kwang Sook.

736
00:48:16,233 --> 00:48:17,233
- Mom. - Hey.

737
00:48:18,033 --> 00:48:19,103
Let's chat.

738
00:48:23,043 --> 00:48:24,043
Okay.

739
00:48:24,343 --> 00:48:25,483
- Chun Soo. - Sure.

740
00:48:29,813 --> 00:48:32,453
(Eagle Brewery)

741
00:48:56,313 --> 00:48:57,943
Isn't he just like your dad?

742
00:49:00,143 --> 00:49:01,143
Who is?

743
00:49:02,283 --> 00:49:03,983
Who else? Mr. Go.

744
00:49:04,683 --> 00:49:06,683
- Mr. Go? - Yes.

745
00:49:08,753 --> 00:49:10,123
- The brewery manager? - Yes.

746
00:49:10,293 --> 00:49:11,563
No way.

747
00:49:11,763 --> 00:49:13,463
He's not at all like Dad.

748
00:49:13,463 --> 00:49:15,093
Dad had thick hair...

749
00:49:15,093 --> 00:49:17,433
and was a small man. They're the complete opposite.

750
00:49:17,433 --> 00:49:19,063
No.

751
00:49:19,233 --> 00:49:21,703
Their overall images and the aura they exude.

752
00:49:21,773 --> 00:49:24,973
Your dad and Mr. Go are exactly alike.

753
00:49:25,773 --> 00:49:26,903
Do you have dementia?

754
00:49:26,903 --> 00:49:27,943
What?

755
00:49:28,843 --> 00:49:31,213
Did you call me over to say that?

756
00:49:31,713 --> 00:49:33,283
No.

757
00:49:33,683 --> 00:49:36,713
How are things going with Chairman Han?

758
00:49:36,883 --> 00:49:39,223
He passed the test long ago, but he hasn't said anything since.

759
00:49:39,223 --> 00:49:41,453
We should set a date for the wedding.

760
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:42,923
What?

761
00:49:43,293 --> 00:49:45,863
Why would we set the date already?

762
00:49:45,963 --> 00:49:47,763
You're not exactly young.

763
00:49:48,293 --> 00:49:49,563
What about children?

764
00:49:50,933 --> 00:49:52,003
Children?

765
00:49:52,133 --> 00:49:54,003
You won't have kids?

766
00:49:54,303 --> 00:49:57,803
Mom. You know how old I am.

767
00:49:57,803 --> 00:49:59,973
These days, women in their 40s...

768
00:49:59,973 --> 00:50:01,943
have babies like it's nothing.

769
00:50:02,773 --> 00:50:05,113
I want to hold my grandchild...

770
00:50:05,113 --> 00:50:07,643
before I go to my grave.

771
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:09,283
Forget it.

772
00:50:09,283 --> 00:50:11,653
What got into you? That's absurd.

773
00:50:11,653 --> 00:50:13,783
- I'll ignore that. My goodness. - Hey! Wait, but...

774
00:50:13,983 --> 00:50:15,123
That's just absurd!

775
00:50:16,123 --> 00:50:18,723
Why would she flip out like that?

776
00:50:19,323 --> 00:50:21,093
All married couples should have children.

777
00:50:24,533 --> 00:50:25,863
I should do something.

778
00:50:29,373 --> 00:50:33,143
You can't tell Kwang Sook that I came here.

779
00:50:33,973 --> 00:50:35,613
Okay, I won't.

780
00:50:35,643 --> 00:50:38,843
I think it's time you started speaking casually with me.

781
00:50:38,943 --> 00:50:39,983
Then...

782
00:50:40,883 --> 00:50:42,113
shall I?

783
00:50:43,883 --> 00:50:44,983
I don't think...

784
00:50:45,923 --> 00:50:49,523
I should leave everything to Kwang Sook.

785
00:50:49,993 --> 00:50:53,493
I came to speak with you to discuss the matter in person.

786
00:50:56,463 --> 00:50:57,493
Come in.

787
00:51:07,743 --> 00:51:08,773
Thank you.

788
00:51:10,873 --> 00:51:11,983
Please.

789
00:51:17,353 --> 00:51:19,553
You passed the test long ago,

790
00:51:19,553 --> 00:51:21,153
so why haven't you gotten anywhere?

791
00:51:21,923 --> 00:51:23,653
Each day feels like a year.

792
00:51:25,563 --> 00:51:28,663
Kwang Sook wants to take things slowly...

793
00:51:28,663 --> 00:51:30,733
to sort out her brothers-in-law's issues...

794
00:51:30,933 --> 00:51:33,363
and get them settled before we marry.

795
00:51:35,033 --> 00:51:37,473
A tree with many branches struggles more in the wind.

796
00:51:38,443 --> 00:51:41,373
She'll never sort out all four brothers-in-law's issues.

797
00:51:41,603 --> 00:51:43,613
If you wait until that's done,

798
00:51:43,613 --> 00:51:46,913
she'll be a grandma with snow-white hair.

799
00:51:48,683 --> 00:51:50,713
So, ignore what Kwang Sook says...

800
00:51:51,013 --> 00:51:52,753
and push her to set a date.

801
00:51:53,553 --> 00:51:56,593
It's not fair that you lived as a widow and widower.

802
00:51:56,793 --> 00:51:59,293
You should start over when you're that much younger.

803
00:51:59,863 --> 00:52:03,563
Okay. I understand what you mean.

804
00:52:05,403 --> 00:52:09,033
I'm so worried about Kwang Sook that I can barely sleep these days.

805
00:52:09,633 --> 00:52:12,073
I stay up most nights.

806
00:52:13,073 --> 00:52:15,643
I'll talk things out with her.

807
00:52:15,643 --> 00:52:16,913
Don't worry too much.

808
00:52:17,873 --> 00:52:18,983
Oh, and...

809
00:52:19,843 --> 00:52:22,153
you must be tired if you can't sleep.

810
00:52:22,383 --> 00:52:24,083
I'll tell my secretary, Ms. Yoon.

811
00:52:24,083 --> 00:52:26,623
Come to the hotel for a facial...

812
00:52:26,623 --> 00:52:28,553
and massage whenever you want.

813
00:52:29,353 --> 00:52:31,553
Oh, can I really do that?

814
00:52:31,623 --> 00:52:33,293
Yes, of course.

815
00:52:40,263 --> 00:52:41,303
Goodbye.

816
00:52:46,503 --> 00:52:49,343
- Hello. - Yes, hi. It has been a while.

817
00:52:49,473 --> 00:52:51,673
- Is the chairman in? - Yes.

818
00:52:52,483 --> 00:52:55,513
Who's the lady that just left?

819
00:52:56,153 --> 00:52:57,253
That was...

820
00:52:57,853 --> 00:53:01,283
the mother of Eagle Brewery's CEO Ma Kwang Sook.

821
00:53:01,483 --> 00:53:03,793
A brewery CEO's mother?

822
00:53:05,823 --> 00:53:06,863
Yes.

823
00:53:08,163 --> 00:53:09,763
Okay, thanks.

824
00:53:13,433 --> 00:53:15,473
I see you just had a visitor.

825
00:53:15,933 --> 00:53:16,933
Pardon?

826
00:53:17,873 --> 00:53:19,003
Yes.

827
00:53:20,603 --> 00:53:22,313
I just got back from the columbarium.

828
00:53:22,913 --> 00:53:26,113
Why did you go on your own? I could've gone with you.

829
00:53:26,343 --> 00:53:28,043
I wanted to go alone today.

830
00:53:28,683 --> 00:53:30,213
I had a lot to say...

831
00:53:30,383 --> 00:53:32,523
to my Min Seo without you present.

832
00:53:35,793 --> 00:53:36,823
Dong Seok.

833
00:53:37,453 --> 00:53:38,463
Yes?

834
00:53:39,193 --> 00:53:41,463
Date all you want. That's not a problem.

835
00:53:42,163 --> 00:53:45,203
But you should be careful before you remarry.

836
00:53:47,833 --> 00:53:49,773
It's not just about your life.

837
00:53:49,773 --> 00:53:52,903
It will have a big impact on the company and your children.

838
00:53:53,403 --> 00:53:55,613
You should never make an emotional decision.

839
00:53:56,873 --> 00:53:58,513
Do you understand what I mean?

840
00:53:59,713 --> 00:54:00,713
Yes.

841
00:54:02,413 --> 00:54:04,753
I came here, hoping to have some tea with you,

842
00:54:05,153 --> 00:54:07,283
but you've already had some with your guest,

843
00:54:07,283 --> 00:54:08,593
so I'll get going.

844
00:54:24,673 --> 00:54:26,843
Why does Yeong Cheol have to hold his wedding...

845
00:54:26,843 --> 00:54:29,113
at this hotel, of all places?

846
00:54:29,113 --> 00:54:32,643
Because of the horrible thing that happened before,

847
00:54:32,743 --> 00:54:34,913
I didn't want to come to this hotel ever again.

848
00:54:37,183 --> 00:54:38,253
A horrible thing?

849
00:54:38,983 --> 00:54:40,083
You don't know?

850
00:54:40,623 --> 00:54:42,493
The woman Sang Nam went on a blind date with.

851
00:54:42,493 --> 00:54:44,453
He lost her to the chairman of this hotel.

852
00:54:44,753 --> 00:54:46,793
Why would you say that?

853
00:54:46,793 --> 00:54:47,823
I didn't lose her to him.

854
00:54:47,823 --> 00:54:51,063
That cheeky lady was two-timing me.

855
00:54:51,063 --> 00:54:54,603
Why would she cheat on the chairman just to date you?

856
00:54:54,603 --> 00:54:55,673
That doesn't make sense.

857
00:54:55,673 --> 00:54:58,133
Hey, I'm telling the truth.

858
00:54:58,133 --> 00:55:00,843
That woman's mother acted as if she'd marry her daughter...

859
00:55:00,843 --> 00:55:02,173
off to me right away.

860
00:55:02,173 --> 00:55:04,073
So I even bought her a designer bag.

861
00:55:04,073 --> 00:55:06,313
Then, she showed up...

862
00:55:06,313 --> 00:55:09,953
with some brawny, bald guy.

863
00:55:10,213 --> 00:55:12,323
I barely got my money back.

864
00:55:13,683 --> 00:55:14,723
Are you serious?

865
00:55:15,423 --> 00:55:17,553
The mother and daughter are a pair of gold diggers.

866
00:55:19,563 --> 00:55:20,963
A pair of gold diggers?

867
00:55:28,333 --> 00:55:30,173
Oh, dear. What's going on?

868
00:55:30,733 --> 00:55:32,573
Speak of the devil. I was just talking about her.

869
00:55:33,143 --> 00:55:34,243
It's her.

870
00:55:34,543 --> 00:55:37,643
That woman is the CEO of the brewery...

871
00:55:37,643 --> 00:55:38,943
who's seeing the chairman of this hotel.

872
00:55:38,943 --> 00:55:40,843
She looks quite innocent, though.

873
00:55:41,543 --> 00:55:43,983
She's not innocent at all. It's all fake.

874
00:55:44,153 --> 00:55:46,583
She's a total gold digger.

875
00:55:56,393 --> 00:55:58,803
The number you have called is currently unavailable.

876
00:55:58,803 --> 00:56:01,333
Come on! This is driving me crazy.

877
00:56:01,603 --> 00:56:04,133
Why is the phone turned off all day?

878
00:56:04,133 --> 00:56:07,003
I can't leave before talking to him. Darn it.

879
00:56:07,603 --> 00:56:08,643
Come in.

880
00:56:09,473 --> 00:56:11,773
Mr. Chairman, it's time to leave for the airport.

881
00:56:11,773 --> 00:56:12,843
Hang on.

882
00:56:12,843 --> 00:56:14,283
The person I'm supposed to meet is not answering the phone.

883
00:56:14,283 --> 00:56:15,483
Let me try calling him again.

884
00:56:18,053 --> 00:56:20,223
The number you have called is currently unavailable.

885
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:21,783
- Come on! - Please...

886
00:56:22,223 --> 00:56:24,023
That darn... My gosh.

887
00:56:26,423 --> 00:56:27,493
Wait outside.

888
00:56:28,223 --> 00:56:29,363
Get out!

889
00:56:35,433 --> 00:56:37,803
Don't get Kang Soo involved in our family's life anymore.

890
00:56:38,743 --> 00:56:40,173
You shouldn't call him...

891
00:56:41,143 --> 00:56:42,343
or meet him anymore.

892
00:56:42,973 --> 00:56:44,073
You promised...

893
00:56:44,643 --> 00:56:46,913
to cut ties with Kang Soo forever.

894
00:57:00,693 --> 00:57:02,063
(Kang Soo)

895
00:57:08,773 --> 00:57:09,833
Hello?

896
00:57:11,203 --> 00:57:12,903
Hello, it's me.

897
00:57:14,243 --> 00:57:16,843
Can you spare me some time tonight?

898
00:57:18,113 --> 00:57:19,183
I want...

899
00:57:19,843 --> 00:57:23,453
to cook you dinner.

900
00:57:24,353 --> 00:57:25,523
Dinner?

901
00:57:27,483 --> 00:57:29,923
My husband is going abroad on a business trip,

902
00:57:30,723 --> 00:57:33,923
and Se Ri is working part-time at a convenience store.

903
00:57:34,963 --> 00:57:36,763
I have something to tell you.

904
00:57:39,133 --> 00:57:42,103
I want to make a meal for you...

905
00:57:43,603 --> 00:57:45,703
with my own hands, Kang Soo.

906
00:57:50,173 --> 00:57:52,283
Can you spare me some time?

907
00:58:07,193 --> 00:58:08,293
Welcome.

908
00:58:08,863 --> 00:58:11,293
I hope I'm not imposing on your time.

909
00:58:11,733 --> 00:58:12,763
Not at all.

910
00:58:13,603 --> 00:58:14,603
My goodness.

911
00:58:15,903 --> 00:58:16,933
They are calla lilies.

912
00:58:17,403 --> 00:58:20,043
It's my favorite flower. How did you know?

913
00:58:20,573 --> 00:58:21,973
I asked Bom.

914
00:58:22,473 --> 00:58:24,613
I see.

915
00:58:26,113 --> 00:58:28,043
Thank you. Come on in.

916
00:58:28,043 --> 00:58:29,383
Okay. Thank you.

917
00:58:37,323 --> 00:58:39,523
You must be hungry. Have a seat.

918
00:58:46,933 --> 00:58:49,003
Did you cook all these yourself?

919
00:58:49,103 --> 00:58:50,773
There are many dishes,

920
00:58:51,273 --> 00:58:54,273
but I'm not sure if there's anything that suits your taste.

921
00:58:55,543 --> 00:58:57,443
I'll get you some soup.

922
00:58:57,443 --> 00:58:58,543
Hang on a second.

923
00:59:12,763 --> 00:59:13,793
Here.

924
00:59:17,633 --> 00:59:19,433
Is today someone's birthday?

925
00:59:20,403 --> 00:59:22,133
No, I just...

926
00:59:22,873 --> 00:59:26,273
happened to make seaweed soup.

927
00:59:27,403 --> 00:59:28,943
Do you like seaweed soup?

928
00:59:29,213 --> 00:59:30,913
Yes. I like it.

929
00:59:32,613 --> 00:59:33,943
I'm glad to hear that.

930
00:59:35,413 --> 00:59:36,853
Go ahead and eat before it gets cold.

931
00:59:37,413 --> 00:59:39,383
Okay. Thank you for the food.

932
00:59:47,493 --> 00:59:49,293
Do you like it?

933
00:59:49,733 --> 00:59:51,563
Yes, it tastes good.

934
00:59:53,833 --> 00:59:56,573
Take your time and enjoy it.

935
01:00:03,943 --> 01:00:05,113
Aren't you eating?

936
01:00:05,913 --> 01:00:08,853
Well, I ate lunch a little late,

937
01:00:08,853 --> 01:00:10,383
so I don't feel like eating now.

938
01:00:10,853 --> 01:00:12,723
Don't worry about me. Eat up.

939
01:00:14,553 --> 01:00:17,393
I wonder if you will like this.

940
01:00:18,023 --> 01:00:19,123
Try this.

941
01:00:28,703 --> 01:00:32,133
I don't think we'll be able to see each other for a while.

942
01:00:32,873 --> 01:00:35,673
So I wanted to treat you to a meal one last time.

943
01:00:37,973 --> 01:00:40,883
You know, my husband is feeling bitter...

944
01:00:40,883 --> 01:00:42,913
toward Eagle Brewery.

945
01:00:44,113 --> 01:00:47,183
So I feel uncomfortable and cautious...

946
01:00:47,453 --> 01:00:48,823
about meeting you.

947
01:00:49,853 --> 01:00:52,523
Yes. I understand.

948
01:00:54,623 --> 01:00:57,293
Even if we can't meet,

949
01:00:57,433 --> 01:01:00,263
I'll hear about you from Se Ri and Bom.

950
01:01:01,703 --> 01:01:02,703
Okay.

951
01:01:05,673 --> 01:01:07,303
Stay healthy.

952
01:01:07,943 --> 01:01:09,873
Take good care of your health.

953
01:01:09,873 --> 01:01:11,073
Okay?

954
01:01:11,573 --> 01:01:13,943
Yes. I will.

955
01:01:28,293 --> 01:01:31,363
And don't try too hard to find...

956
01:01:33,433 --> 01:01:34,763
your birth parents.

957
01:01:36,373 --> 01:01:37,373
Okay?

958
01:01:41,603 --> 01:01:42,943
In life,

959
01:01:44,543 --> 01:01:47,943
there are times when it's better not to know the truth.

960
01:01:51,013 --> 01:01:54,483
You have people who eat with you, sleep under the same roof,

961
01:01:55,423 --> 01:01:56,993
care for you when you are sick,

962
01:01:57,453 --> 01:02:00,423
and comfort you when you are sad. They are your real family.

963
01:02:01,423 --> 01:02:02,493
So,

964
01:02:04,363 --> 01:02:06,063
don't try too hard...

965
01:02:07,503 --> 01:02:08,763
to find your birth parents.

966
01:02:09,903 --> 01:02:10,973
Okay?

967
01:02:12,573 --> 01:02:14,973
Yes. I will remember that.

968
01:02:19,013 --> 01:02:20,983
What do you think you are doing?

969
01:02:21,683 --> 01:02:25,213
Honey, aren't you supposed to be in the Philippines now?

970
01:02:25,823 --> 01:02:27,723
While I was on a business trip,

971
01:02:27,723 --> 01:02:31,093
you called this brat over to our house without telling me?

972
01:02:31,093 --> 01:02:32,593
It's not like that, honey.

973
01:02:32,593 --> 01:02:33,823
You...

974
01:02:39,433 --> 01:02:40,633
What are you doing?

975
01:02:41,763 --> 01:02:43,433
Don't lay a hand on my mother.

976
01:03:46,863 --> 01:03:49,403
(For Eagle Brothers)

977
01:03:49,733 --> 01:03:51,733
Were you never going to tell me?

978
01:03:51,903 --> 01:03:53,743
I wanted you to tell me first, Mom.

979
01:03:53,873 --> 01:03:57,073
I believed that not telling you was for your own good.

980
01:03:57,413 --> 01:03:59,383
You were only looking out for yourself and your family.

981
01:03:59,943 --> 01:04:01,943
I had something to say.

982
01:04:02,043 --> 01:04:03,053
Are you busy?

983
01:04:03,053 --> 01:04:06,553
I hope you'll accept it as a kind gesture.

984
01:04:06,853 --> 01:04:08,383
Chairman Han...

985
01:04:08,523 --> 01:04:11,953
as in Chairman Han Dong Seok?

986
01:04:12,293 --> 01:04:14,093
I'm truly sorry.

987
01:04:14,093 --> 01:04:16,033
She already hates me as it is,

988
01:04:16,093 --> 01:04:17,293
and now I'm completely in the doghouse.
