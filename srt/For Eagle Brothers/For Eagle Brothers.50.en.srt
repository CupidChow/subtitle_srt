1
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:02,370
Hello?

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:03,840
Whereabouts are you now?

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,310
I'm just about to leave.

4
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:07,550
I'll be right there.

5
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:10,150
I have a dress fitting.

6
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:11,180
Oh, dear.

7
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:15,390
- See you later.
- Drive safely.

8
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,520
(Episode 50)

9
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,860
(Eagle Brewery Unrefined Makgeolli)

10
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,570
You're late.

11
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:30,970
Sorry.

12
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:33,940
I met with wholesalers all morning,

13
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:36,370
and the meeting about
expanding our facilities dragged on.

14
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,540
It's good to be busy,

15
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:42,050
but thinking our wedding's lower
on your list would upset me.

16
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:44,650
Okay. I'll be careful.

17
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:46,420
Let's go inside.

18
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,860
My gosh. You're beautiful.

19
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,770
Why don't you turn on the spot?

20
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:03,470
Okay.

21
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,180
What do you think, sir?

22
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:15,280
I don't think this is it.

23
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,620
What about it don't you like?

24
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,450
It's too revealing.

25
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,460
Most wedding dresses
are like this nowadays.

26
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:27,290
I want something
more demure and elegant.

27
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,330
What do you think, Kwang Sook?

28
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:33,830
Let's do that.

29
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:39,740
The bell line suits you so well too.

30
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,110
What do you think, sir?

31
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,880
It looks like
she jumped out of a Disney movie.

32
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,110
Right? She looks like a princess.

33
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:51,580
We're not in our 20s.

34
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:54,350
How about something
neater and classier?

35
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:57,920
I want you to look calm and poised.

36
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,120
Okay.

37
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:03,800
Then, shall we go with that?

38
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:08,130
This is perfect.

39
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,370
It's poised and refined.

40
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,840
I'm sure you must like it, sir.

41
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,210
It's not poised and refined.

42
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,440
It's too plain and common.

43
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,150
Does this one
not make the cut either?

44
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,450
It's not that
it doesn't make the cut.

45
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:28,220
I just want to be prudent.

46
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:32,920
Can't I just wear anything?

47
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,730
I just want us to take
all the precautions we can...

48
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,960
in order to make you stand out
even more.

49
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:49,410
Why are we here?

50
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:50,980
To check out some interior designs.

51
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,450
Interior designs?

52
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,210
Someone new will be
moving into the house.

53
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,650
I thought we should change...

54
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,920
the kitchen design
and the cabinets, at least.

55
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,850
We agreed we wouldn't get
wedding gifts or home furnishings.

56
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,860
I'm not asking you for anything.

57
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,360
I want to do this for you
as a present.

58
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:22,470
(Apfel Kitchen)

59
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,750
Doesn't this look nice?

60
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,920
They can customize the size too.

61
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:41,390
You're going to do
what you want anyway.

62
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,560
Why are you asking for my opinion?

63
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,800
It was the same with the honeymoon.

64
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,710
You didn't even ask me
where I wanted to go.

65
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,440
You just went ahead
and made reservations.

66
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,710
I made the reservations
because you said it was okay.

67
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,580
But the other places
were all too far and expensive.

68
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,650
That's why I agreed.

69
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,050
But it wasn't what I wanted.

70
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:11,060
Then, you should've mentioned it
back then.

71
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:13,020
If you say this
after everything has been decided,

72
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,990
all my effort becomes a waste.

73
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,630
You know, Dong Seok,

74
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:23,270
you're just asking if I like them
to be polite,

75
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,100
even though you've already made
all the decisions.

76
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,840
Isn't that true?

77
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:30,610
That's how it felt to me.

78
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,110
That's not true.

79
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,880
I just did that...

80
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,380
in case you felt uncomfortable,
so you wouldn't have to worry.

81
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,820
Yes, Mother.

82
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:49,460
I just came home...

83
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,900
after paying the deposit
with the money you sent.

84
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:54,930
I'm glad you did.

85
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,940
Who would've ever imagined...

86
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,440
that I'd get all this help
from my son-in-law so late in life?

87
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:04,880
Thank you, Dong Seok.

88
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,050
You're welcome.

89
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,410
Then, you will be able to move in...

90
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:10,980
as soon as
our wedding is over, right?

91
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:12,880
Okay.

92
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,790
Dr. Hwang will be happy to hear...

93
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:17,160
that you're coming back.

94
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,460
All right. Bye.

95
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:26,130
Were you just talking to my mom?

96
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,600
I wanted this to be a surprise
after the wedding.

97
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,310
I helped Mother out
with her security deposit...

98
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,210
for Golden Castle.

99
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,710
How could you make
such an important decision...

100
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,650
without discussing it with me?

101
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,950
I figured it'd be too much pressure
for you if you knew.

102
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,620
It was with the best intentions.

103
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,450
Even if that's the case,

104
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,590
it's a little uncomfortable for me.

105
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:56,460
I thought it would be uncomfortable
for Mother to stay...

106
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,960
in the house once you're gone.

107
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,600
I was just worried. That's all.

108
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:01,070
Why are you taking it so...

109
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,200
What you're doing...

110
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,870
feels like you're bragging
about your wealth, to be honest.

111
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:08,940
It makes me feel pathetic.

112
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,610
Bragging about my wealth?

113
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:15,210
But...

114
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,550
how could you say that?

115
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:22,050
Why would I brag
about my wealth to you?

116
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,220
These days,

117
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,660
that's how everything feels to me.

118
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:28,990
As we get ready for the wedding,

119
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:31,900
you decide everything by yourself
and just tell me about it,

120
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,160
like the wedding dress,

121
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:36,670
the honeymoon, the interior design,

122
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,870
and even my mom's move
to Golden Castle.

123
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:43,780
Am I just supposed to tag along?

124
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,580
Kwang Sook.

125
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:55,820
You seem to be on edge
as the wedding gets closer.

126
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,560
What did you say?

127
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:00,760
Let's stop this.

128
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,190
I'm home.

129
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:37,060
Oh, did you get off work early?

130
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,960
Yes, I was a little tired,
so I came home early.

131
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,070
I'll let you rest.

132
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,410
Did something happen?

133
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,480
Bragging about my wealth?

134
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,790
I just wanted the best for her,

135
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,890
but she saw that as bragging?

136
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,390
I get that she's angry,
but she should know what not to say.

137
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:09,130
Gosh, I can't believe it.

138
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,430
Oh, dear.

139
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,970
I thought you were shopping
for your wedding dress.

140
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:17,970
Are you finished already?

141
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,440
I think I might have to...

142
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,510
reconsider this marriage.

143
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:26,980
Pardon?

144
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,120
What is it now?

145
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,260
Aren't you being cowardly?

146
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:43,430
How could you tell
my husband everything?

147
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,560
Is this the kind of man you are?

148
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,530
I've given you fair warning,
but you keep ignoring me.

149
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,840
What else could I do?

150
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,570
It won't do you any good
if Chairman Jang finds out...

151
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:55,570
about you coming here.

152
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,540
Is that a threat?

153
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,080
It's not a threat. It's a warning.

154
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,010
Let me make this clear.

155
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,350
You've crossed a line
you shouldn't have.

156
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,120
I'm Ha Ni's mom.

157
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,790
There's no such thing
as a line I shouldn't cross...

158
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:08,850
when it comes to my child.

159
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,520
You keep trying to get away
with what you did as Ha Ni's mom,

160
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,930
but that's utter nonsense.

161
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:17,660
If you try to muddy things again,
it won't end with Chairman Jang.

162
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:20,330
I'll go to court
for a restraining order...

163
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:22,000
and keep you from seeing Ha Ni
for the rest of your life.

164
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,070
So, you want
to take things that far?

165
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,040
Yes.

166
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,070
If you take things too far,
I will too. So,

167
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,710
stop getting clingy
with me and my daughter.

168
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:34,150
You can live the flashy life
that you chose. Understand?

169
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:50,630
Dad, did the questioning go well?

170
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:53,660
I talked through everything
with them.

171
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,470
You don't have to worry.

172
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,500
Are you sure everything is fine?

173
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:00,000
It's all right.

174
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,570
I'll go inside and get some rest.

175
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,230
What is it?

176
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:33,600
You must be tired from
the prosecutor's interrogation.

177
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,440
They say you leave an interrogation
feeling completely drained,

178
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,080
even if you went in feeling fine.

179
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,410
Are you okay?

180
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,410
You know so much about that,

181
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,120
and yet you stabbed me in the back?

182
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:47,890
Honey.

183
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,720
Don't even call me that!

184
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:51,220
It gives me the chills.

185
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,660
If you just own up to your crimes...

186
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,530
and get a petition
from Eagle Brewery,

187
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:57,030
you may be able to get off
with probation...

188
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,530
if not an acquittal.

189
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,300
Enough of your nonsense!
I'm hanging up!

190
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,040
Darn it.

191
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:12,580
My dad and your sister-in-law...

192
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,980
went to shop
for wedding dresses today.

193
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,810
I wonder if they picked one out.

194
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,280
Right.

195
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,350
How do you feel, Kang Soo?

196
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:29,990
To be honest, thinking about
saying goodbye to Kwang Sook...

197
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,060
made me sad and upset at first.

198
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,170
But now, I've come to accept it.

199
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,570
You say that now,
but will you cry at the wedding?

200
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,070
I might.

201
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,010
You're so lucky to have
someone like my sister-in-law...

202
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,620
become your mom.

203
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,820
I know that I'm lucky,

204
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,660
but I'm not over the moon about it.

205
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:05,830
If your sister-in-law
becomes my stepmom...

206
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:12,400
That will complicate things
between us.

207
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,110
Yes.

208
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,650
Still, we can remain close friends
as we are now, right?

209
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:49,640
We have to expand
the manufacturing facilities...

210
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,680
and prepare Yeoung Ju's tuition.

211
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:54,310
I won't have extra money
for a while.

212
00:12:56,210 --> 00:13:00,120
I need you to bear with me, Mom.

213
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:02,320
Next year,

214
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,620
I promise to send you back
to Golden Castle, okay?

215
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,460
You want me
to stay with and tiptoe around...

216
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:12,460
your ex-brothers-in-law
after you move out?

217
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,700
Does that even make sense?

218
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:18,370
It's not like you ever...

219
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:21,170
tiptoed around any of them
while living here.

220
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:24,240
I already paid the security deposit,

221
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,810
and they allocated me a suite.

222
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,550
I'll pack up and move
as soon as your wedding's over.

223
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,810
That's that.

224
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:34,250
Why do I even bother?

225
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,320
Oh, whatever!

226
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:41,160
I'm going back to Golden Castle!

227
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,400
I'll leave.

228
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:57,070
What did you eat
that you got indigestion this time?

229
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,180
I met some friends
and had naengmyeon.

230
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:05,480
I guess that was it.

231
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,750
You were healthy enough...

232
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,090
to chomp on steel
before we got married.

233
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,760
Why did you become so frail
right after our wedding?

234
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,560
Yes?

235
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,160
Goodness.

236
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:21,900
I heard
you couldn't even have dinner.

237
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,870
Nurungji is best
when you don't feel well.

238
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:28,070
It's pretty watery,
so it'll calm your stomach.

239
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:29,540
Thanks, Mi Sun.

240
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,010
Thank you.

241
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:37,350
It's practically rice-flavored tea,
so try a few spoonfuls.

242
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,150
You might feel worse
if your stomach's empty.

243
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,290
Okay.

244
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,020
Here you go.

245
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,960
Hey.

246
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,060
What's the matter?

247
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,270
Oh, dear. Are you...

248
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:00,800
Gosh. It's bad.

249
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,140
I think she should see
a medical specialist.

250
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:08,480
Rather than a hospital, she needs
something from the pharmacy first.

251
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,480
The pharmacy?

252
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:13,680
I think Ok Bun's pregnant.

253
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:15,650
What?

254
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:28,300
(Pyeonghoe Pharmacy)

255
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,810
(Pharmacy)

256
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,650
Hello? You're in, aren't you?

257
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,750
Hello?

258
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:49,090
Hello. It's really urgent.

259
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:51,390
Can you unlock the door?

260
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:54,730
Thanks.

261
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,930
We're closed. What's the matter?

262
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:00,400
I'm really sorry.

263
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,600
Can you get me a pregnancy test?

264
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,740
A test kit?

265
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,100
Yes.

266
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,240
I might be a dad soon.

267
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:18,180
Heung Soo. There are two lines.

268
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,950
Two lines!

269
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,460
There really are two lines.

270
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,600
We got two lines.

271
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,230
Congratulations on going...

272
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,340
from a husband to a dad.

273
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,140
Thank you.

274
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:43,040
Thanks, Ok Bun!

275
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,910
Watch out.

276
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,550
We should be careful.

277
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,720
Yes, right.

278
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:55,890
Let's go to bed.

279
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,820
- Oh, boy.
- Gather round! It's an emergency!

280
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,360
Come to the living room!

281
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:04,290
Get out here!

282
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,230
- What is it?
- Gather round!

283
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:12,500
See? There are two lines.
We got a positive.

284
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,640
Does someone have COVID-19?

285
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:17,240
Why would someone have COVID-19?

286
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,740
Oh Heung Soo here will be a dad.

287
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,310
My gosh.

288
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,580
Congratulations, Heung Soo.

289
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,820
Congratulations, Ok Bun.

290
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,890
I had a feeling she was pregnant.

291
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:32,290
Congratulations to you both.

292
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,890
Congratulations, Heung Soo.

293
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:36,890
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

294
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:39,030
Thanks, guys. Thank you.

295
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,030
Why would you cry
on a good day like this?

296
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,740
Don't cry. Stop it.

297
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,600
Okay. Thanks.

298
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,820
Thank you.

299
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:21,410
Wait.

300
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,110
We parted like that,

301
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,510
and he never called once?

302
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,580
He's such a sulker.

303
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,230
What you're doing...

304
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:43,430
feels like you're bragging
about your wealth, to be honest.

305
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:45,700
It makes me feel pathetic.

306
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:53,300
I wouldn't feel bad if I got that
after doing some actual bragging.

307
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:57,940
She doesn't want jewelry,
wedding gifts, or new furniture.

308
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:02,350
Does she dislike
whatever I do or what?

309
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:04,950
Goodness.

310
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,990
Mom.

311
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,320
When did you come home?

312
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,830
Around dawn.

313
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:20,360
He must've had a hard time
at the prosecutors' office.

314
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,330
I wanted to cook your dad
some hot soup.

315
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:25,000
It would make me feel better.

316
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,170
Dad's still angry with you.

317
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,280
He'll flip out
if he knows you're here.

318
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,250
I know.

319
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:40,220
I'm sure he was stressed out
and on edge all day yesterday.

320
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:43,320
I came by because I wanted
to cook him a hot meal.

321
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,090
When he wakes up,

322
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:50,860
reheat the beef soup.

323
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,030
I grilled some laver
coated with a mix...

324
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:56,400
of sesame oil and perilla oil,
which he likes.

325
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,830
Be sure to set it out for him.

326
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:01,070
Even if he says he has no appetite,

327
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:04,580
try to force him
to eat something, okay?

328
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:06,040
Okay.

329
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:07,910
I'm off.

330
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,360
Take care, darling puppy.

331
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:22,960
Mom.

332
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,640
Get back safely.

333
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:39,780
Hey.

334
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,280
You're up.

335
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:42,580
Yes.

336
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:45,280
I'm hungry. Cook me some ramyeon.

337
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,420
You can't have that for breakfast.

338
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,350
I made some beef soup.

339
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:52,060
Beef soup?

340
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,660
Yes. Let's eat.

341
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:09,670
Dig in.

342
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,320
What is it? Does it taste bad?

343
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,630
Is it okay?

344
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,310
It tastes better
than your mom's version.

345
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,480
It's tasty.

346
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,970
Goodness me.

347
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,040
Did you eat that all by yourself?

348
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:20,640
The smell of everything else
made me queasy,

349
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,980
but I couldn't stop
craving watermelon.

350
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,080
I see.

351
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,050
Did you see a doctor?

352
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:32,260
Yes, I went this morning
with Heung Soo.

353
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,690
I'm three weeks pregnant.

354
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,260
My gosh!

355
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,600
The early stages of pregnancy
are the most important.

356
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,660
You need to be extremely careful
from now on.

357
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,470
Watch how you walk at all times,

358
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:44,030
and don't do anything...

359
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,570
that might put pressure
on your belly. Got it?

360
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,800
Sure.

361
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:51,540
That's why I'm going to close
the salon for a while.

362
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,810
Ever since
I became a hairstylist at 20,

363
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:56,680
I have never taken a break.

364
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:58,750
I'll take this opportunity
to do just that.

365
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,480
Good for you.

366
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:03,990
Kwang Sook should marry soon...

367
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:05,960
and have a child of her own as well.

368
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:10,060
Wait. Is she thinking
about having kids?

369
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:11,530
What?

370
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,230
Well...

371
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:15,630
I wouldn't mind one, two,
or even twins.

372
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:18,270
Dig in.

373
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,350
I have the draft
for your wedding invitation, sir.

374
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,020
Could you confirm it?

375
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,750
Handle it yourself.

376
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:37,820
Me?

377
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:39,960
Just get it done.

378
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:43,860
Yes, sir.

379
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:51,030
Darn.

380
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,840
(Chairman Han Dong Seok)

381
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,410
Yes, Mother.

382
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:04,610
I called to see
if you and Kwang Sook...

383
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:06,920
had made up.

384
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,650
I waited all night for her to call,

385
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,990
but she didn't,
let alone text to apologize.

386
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,990
Don't be like that,

387
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:19,460
and try reaching out to her first.

388
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:24,170
Women tend to get sensitive
when wedding bells draw near.

389
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,670
Does being on edge excuse you
from everything?

390
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:29,270
This time around,

391
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,540
I'm going to get...

392
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34,080
an apology from her, no matter what.

393
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,590
Why are you two in a standoff...

394
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:47,390
when the wedding's
just around the corner?

395
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,990
Come on.

396
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:55,770
He's only happy
when he gets what he wants.

397
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:58,800
One of you has to extend
an olive branch first...

398
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,270
for you two to reconcile.

399
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:03,540
How about you apologize first?

400
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:09,650
I have no intention of doing so.

401
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:21,760
If we leave them to reconcile
on their own,

402
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:23,990
the wedding won't move forward.

403
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:25,800
Tell me about it.

404
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:27,800
They're arguing over nothing...

405
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,270
just to avoid losing.

406
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,440
That's why the concept
of "marriage blues" is real.

407
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:37,370
Being on edge about the big day...

408
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,240
often leads to mood swings.

409
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:42,980
People tend to fuss over things
that hardly matter.

410
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:46,150
So what can we do about this?

411
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:48,590
We need to get them to reconcile.

412
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:51,920
Neither of them will meet
unless the other apologizes first.

413
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:54,090
How can we get them to make up?

414
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:07,970
It's me, CEO Ma.

415
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:09,470
Dong Seok, is that you?

416
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:14,840
I have something to discuss
about the renovation.

417
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:16,210
- Can we meet up?
- Can we meet up?

418
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,460
You might be my daughter,

419
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,900
but honestly, I just can't...

420
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:34,160
understand you.

421
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:37,200
They say some people don't know
how lucky they are.

422
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:39,400
You have someone like Dong Seok...

423
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,070
who's attentive
and ready to make decisions,

424
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:44,040
yet instead of being grateful,

425
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:46,680
you keep complaining.

426
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,350
These days,

427
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:51,980
you always need to ask
what your partner wants.

428
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,880
He may be good at decision-making,

429
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,350
but he should always consider
the bride's preferences first.

430
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:59,160
It's wrong to ignore her opinions.

431
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:01,620
Mother.

432
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:04,460
I never ignored...

433
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,700
her preferences or opinions.

434
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,770
As if I don't know you.

435
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,170
Being a bulldozer at every turn...

436
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:13,970
will eventually get you labeled
as dogmatic.

437
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:17,670
No one is as stubborn
as my daughter.

438
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:19,610
Do you know what her nickname is?

439
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,240
It's TN.

440
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,380
TN?

441
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:24,480
A total nutcase.

442
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,120
If something doesn't go her way,

443
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,720
she gets all hysterical.

444
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,320
There are times...

445
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:32,460
when I struggle
to handle my own daughter.

446
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,360
With the wedding so close,

447
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,990
I just want to tell them
to let this go.

448
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:41,530
But this isn't something
that can just be brushed aside.

449
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:43,430
I totally agree.

450
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,900
Even if we have to
postpone the wedding,

451
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,940
we need to figure out...

452
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,640
who was exactly at fault...

453
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,540
so this doesn't happen again.

454
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,280
I'm with you on that.

455
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:58,180
Stand your ground
and make him apologize.

456
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:01,480
The wedding isn't
what's important anymore.

457
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,190
You should teach Kwang Sook
a lesson...

458
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:06,460
before deciding on marriage.

459
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:13,400
- Put the wedding on hold.
- Put the wedding on hold.

460
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,100
That's insane.

461
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:20,100
After everything we went through
to get here?

462
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,640
Why should we postpone the wedding?

463
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:23,170
That doesn't seem right.

464
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,240
Exactly.

465
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,340
That's not right.

466
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:30,750
Honestly,
I was a bit touchy about it.

467
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,480
I followed my usual way
of doing things...

468
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,450
and pushed my opinions on you.
I'm sorry.

469
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:38,690
It's okay.

470
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:41,460
I guess I overreacted.

471
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:44,360
I'm partly to blame for this too.

472
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,750
Wouldn't you say
that's a mission accomplished?

473
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,250
I give you five stars
for your realistic acting.

474
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:17,130
We recently agreed...

475
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,700
that the first to reach out
isn't the loser...

476
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:23,000
but the one to come around first.

477
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:25,070
Exactly.

478
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,740
Why can't I seem to do that
even though I know it's right?

479
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:31,540
Once we're married,

480
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,340
I promise I'll try harder.

481
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:38,620
I admit I pushed you
in my usual way of doing things.

482
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,620
Sorry about that.

483
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,250
Don't be.

484
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:44,150
I let my low self-esteem...

485
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,890
make me overly sensitive.

486
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:47,860
I'm sorry.

487
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:50,630
You can decide on the dress...

488
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,030
and the honeymoon location.

489
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,430
I'm good with whatever you want.

490
00:29:56,930 --> 00:30:00,700
Then, let me pay you back
the deposit for Golden Castle...

491
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:02,810
that you gave my mom.

492
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:05,440
I'll even sign a promissory note.

493
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:09,610
Why should we bother to write...

494
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:11,180
a promissory note between us?

495
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,980
That's the only way I'll be at ease.

496
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,750
You sure are stubborn.

497
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:21,220
All right, fine.
Sign a promissory note.

498
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:23,060
Unbelievable.

499
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:30,370
By the way,
didn't my mom and Ms. Park...

500
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:33,100
seem odd to you earlier?

501
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:35,170
They seemed perfectly coordinated,

502
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:38,940
and I feel like we got tricked.

503
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:42,010
That thought
did cross my mind earlier,

504
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:45,420
but since it helped us reconcile,

505
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,020
let's not make a big deal out of it.

506
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:50,620
Sure.

507
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,330
Guys, the sirutteok is here.

508
00:30:58,430 --> 00:30:59,730
- Hey.
- Oh, right.

509
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,270
Let's take a look. Open it.

510
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:06,870
Let me see.

511
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,840
The red beans look great.

512
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,910
- Right?
- Yes.

513
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:13,940
How will Chairman Han bring
the wedding gift box?

514
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,280
Are his friends going
to accompany him?

515
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:18,010
I'm not sure.
He never talked about details.

516
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,520
My gosh.

517
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:24,120
The smell of oil.

518
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:25,390
Oh, gosh.

519
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:28,190
If this makes you feel queasy,
stay in our room.

520
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:31,890
Should I walk you there?

521
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,200
Hey, Oh Heung Soo.

522
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,430
- Don't be dramatic.
- Stop it.

523
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:38,530
Why would you walk her there...

524
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:40,040
when your room is
only a few steps away?

525
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,770
She needs to be careful.

526
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,740
Please let me know
if you're craving anything.

527
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:46,180
I'll pick it up
on my way home from work.

528
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:50,010
My youngest brother-in-law
is the sweetest.

529
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,350
Thanks.

530
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:52,880
I'm at your service too.

531
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,880
Right. Thanks.

532
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:58,990
By the way,
where are Kwang Sook and Mi Sun?

533
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,830
I called you here to give you this.

534
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,100
What's this?

535
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,910
These are the rings I got
from Jang Soo.

536
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,510
His late mother...

537
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:21,540
inherited those from her own mother.

538
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,980
Why would you give me these?

539
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,650
Because beginning tomorrow,

540
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,790
I won't be...

541
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:33,590
the Oh family's
daughter-in-law anymore.

542
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,930
You should be the one to have them.

543
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:44,200
Thanks, Kwang Sook.

544
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:47,470
I'll cherish them.

545
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:52,110
Can I do the honors?

546
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:53,980
Yes, please.

547
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,060
My gosh.

548
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:13,230
They fit perfectly.

549
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:16,230
Tell me about it.

550
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:19,540
You are...

551
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,700
the daughter-in-law of this family,

552
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:24,040
sent from above.

553
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,640
Is that so?

554
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:30,680
Buy your wedding gift box.

555
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:31,910
- Heung Soo.
- Got it.

556
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:33,350
- Buy your wedding gift box.
- I'll take it.

557
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:35,790
- There.
- Goodness me.

558
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:39,120
- Is it just you with the box?
- Hello. My gosh.

559
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,660
Yes, I came alone
to keep things quiet and simple.

560
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,830
- Goodness.
- Allow me.

561
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:46,930
- There you go.
- Oh, my.

562
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,170
All right, then. Let's sit.

563
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:50,230
Sure.

564
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:58,170
Why don't we put this down
and cut the sirutteok first?

565
00:33:58,170 --> 00:33:59,710
Sure thing.

566
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,110
Right.

567
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,120
Look at that.

568
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,020
- My gosh.
- No way.

569
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:13,590
Here you go.

570
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,390
Let's cut it together.

571
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:16,660
Sure.

572
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,000
All right.

573
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,970
- Nice.
- There you go.

574
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:32,010
Just like cutting this rice cake,

575
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:36,850
share the joy
and halve the sorrow...

576
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,150
to live a good life. Got it?

577
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:42,290
Thank you.

578
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:47,890
All right, then.
Here's the highlight of the night.

579
00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:50,630
Put the rice cake away
and present the wedding gift box.

580
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,630
All right.

581
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,560
Everyone in the world...

582
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,330
is curious to see
Chairman Han's special package.

583
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:57,530
Place it on the table.

584
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,700
What could be in it?

585
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,270
May I have your attention, please?

586
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:04,670
Wealth, looks, and character.

587
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:07,010
Chairman Han Dong Seok
is a triple threat.

588
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:10,080
He took it upon himself
to prepare this wedding gift box.

589
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,320
What could be in it?

590
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,750
Drum roll, please.

591
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:18,750
Bride, please go ahead
and open the box.

592
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:25,230
Drum roll, please.

593
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:33,440
Please lift up what's inside.

594
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,470
Here.

595
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,440
I can already tell
this is something big.

596
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,310
All right.

597
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:45,520
- What is it?
- No way.

598
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:49,850
The bride will open the gift
on the count of three.

599
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:53,020
One, two, three.

600
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:03,930
- Wait.
- What's that?

601
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:11,840
All right!

602
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,740
- What?
- What?

603
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:17,980
What are these? Gym clothes?

604
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,080
What's that?

605
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,320
Kwang Sook and I chose this gift
after a lot of thought.

606
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,290
There's one for me as well,
so let me join the morning stretch.

607
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,260
You're always welcome to join us.

608
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:35,060
This is the most unique gift box
I've ever seen.

609
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:38,530
There must be one for Ha Ni.

610
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,440
Here you go. This one's for Ha Ni.

611
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,670
- Goodness.
- Lucky her.

612
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:45,840
- My gosh.
- Thanks for getting one for Ha Ni.

613
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:49,110
Do you like it?

614
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:53,580
With wealth, looks, character,

615
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:56,650
and clever wit as well,
Chairman Han Dong Seok...

616
00:36:56,650 --> 00:37:00,290
has officially proven
he is Korea's best son-in-law.

617
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:01,460
Applause!

618
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:16,510
Don't think about anything else,
and get a good night's sleep.

619
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:18,110
I'll see you tomorrow
at our wedding.

620
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:23,450
Thank you for today. Sweet dreams.

621
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:34,520
Tomorrow,

622
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:38,430
you will finally be mine.

623
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,330
I know.

624
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:45,000
I still can't believe it.

625
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:48,200
Don't you run away.

626
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,070
I'm more worried
that you'll run away.

627
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,180
Good night. I'll see you tomorrow.

628
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:14,430
Grandma,
are you heading back to the US...

629
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:16,000
right after Dad's wedding?

630
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:19,540
Yes, I have
something important scheduled.

631
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:22,970
Can't you stay here with us?

632
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:25,310
I don't feel at ease,

633
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:27,380
letting you leave
for the US like this.

634
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:29,810
My condition is still
in its early stages,

635
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:31,550
and the medication is helping.

636
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,280
And...

637
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:37,620
I need to wrap up my life
in my own way.

638
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:40,520
What if something happens
while you're alone?

639
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:43,090
Nothing will happen to me,
so don't worry.

640
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,860
Now that your dad's
getting remarried,

641
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:49,470
maybe you should think
about settling down too.

642
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:51,830
I'm home.

643
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:54,640
Right. Did you give them
the wedding gift box?

644
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,870
Yes, Mother.

645
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:58,570
Good.

646
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:02,610
Knowing you're starting fresh
with someone new,

647
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:06,180
I can finally go home
feeling at peace.

648
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:08,320
Congratulations.

649
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:14,590
Truly, congratulations.

650
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:19,100
I'll have a good life.

651
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:31,670
Mr. Go, have you been drinking?

652
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:33,310
That's right.

653
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:35,910
I just couldn't...

654
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:39,220
handle this while sober.

655
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:44,120
How could you abandon me...

656
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:48,590
and move to Golden Castle
by yourself?

657
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:52,660
Is this all that our relationship...

658
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:55,700
meant to you?

659
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:59,970
That's why I asked you
to come with me.

660
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:03,170
They give a discount
to couples who move in together.

661
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:04,570
Are you kidding me?

662
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,310
I can't leave the brewery
and move with you.

663
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,050
Not to mention...

664
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:11,810
I can't afford a place there.

665
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:14,650
I'm sorry, Mr. Go,

666
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:18,320
but returning to Golden Castle...

667
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:22,590
is a longtime dream of mine.

668
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:25,930
Is it Go Ja Dong...

669
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:28,160
or Golden Castle?

670
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:30,570
To be honest,

671
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:32,740
to me...

672
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:42,240
Both are important.

673
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:48,380
You can pick just one.

674
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:50,650
Is it Mr. Go...

675
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:52,690
or Golden Castle?

676
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:00,860
Think carefully.
You have until tomorrow...

677
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,430
to give me an answer.

678
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:18,280
If I pick him,
I lose out on Golden Castle.

679
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:21,620
If I pick Golden Castle,
I lose out on love.

680
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,820
This is driving me insane.

681
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:32,900
Mom.

682
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:34,460
Yes?

683
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:41,000
Shall we have some makgeolli?

684
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,310
No.

685
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:46,180
I'm not in the mood for makgeolli.

686
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:03,730
I'll start filming.

687
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:10,170
Make up an acrostic poem
with "Ma Kwang Sook."

688
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:11,570
Ma.

689
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:16,470
You took us all in...

690
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,280
with your deep and loving heart.

691
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:21,380
Kwang.

692
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:24,210
Even when ferocious winds blew,

693
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:28,850
you sheltered us.

694
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:31,090
Sook.

695
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:35,020
I offer you my gratitude...

696
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:39,460
and utmost respect.

697
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:44,270
Well done.

698
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:46,740
- Was that okay?
- Yes, nice one.

699
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:48,970
What are you all doing in there?

700
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:52,040
It's Kwang Sook.

701
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,640
It's a secret
that we're making a video.

702
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:56,710
- Keep quiet.
- Okay.

703
00:42:57,710 --> 00:42:59,010
Yes, Kwang Sook.

704
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,450
It's our last night together.

705
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:07,290
How about we have
some makgeolli together?

706
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:11,130
I'm tired and would like to sleep.

707
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:12,930
Me too.

708
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:19,340
We must be careful
in the early stages of pregnancy.

709
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,400
Let's go to bed.

710
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:22,870
Okay.

711
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:30,710
Beom Soo. How about just one glass?

712
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:32,180
Well...

713
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:35,850
Ha Ni has been having
a hard time sleeping at night.

714
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:37,190
I should go to my room.

715
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:38,850
Good night.

716
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:41,190
I don't feel well right now.

717
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:50,670
You have to get your makeup done
early tomorrow.

718
00:43:51,070 --> 00:43:52,100
Why don't you go to bed?

719
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,470
Yes, Kwang Sook.

720
00:43:54,770 --> 00:43:56,940
Your makeup won't look good
if you don't sleep well.

721
00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:32,010
Then...

722
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:34,540
will you live here
without your husband?

723
00:44:34,610 --> 00:44:35,940
Of course.

724
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:38,310
Get a grip, you brat.

725
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:39,720
You'll live as a widow...

726
00:44:39,850 --> 00:44:43,220
and rot away in this house
for the rest of your life?

727
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:46,220
Whatever others say,
I'll die and haunt this house!

(Do your best
and leave the rest to fate.)

737
00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:22,880
(Eagle Brewery)

738
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:31,550
Kwang Sook?

739
00:47:32,690 --> 00:47:34,660
Oh, where did she go?

740
00:47:35,790 --> 00:47:36,990
Is she in the bathroom?

741
00:47:39,830 --> 00:47:41,560
Kwang Sook. Are you in here?

742
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:43,670
Oh, dear.

743
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:49,270
- Good morning.
- Hi.

744
00:47:49,270 --> 00:47:51,270
Where did she go so early?

745
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:52,980
Kwang Sook?

746
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,310
Yes. She's not answering her phone.

747
00:47:55,310 --> 00:47:56,980
I don't know what she's up to.

748
00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:00,120
Last night, she invited us
to have makgeolli with her.

749
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:06,190
Hey. Go look.

750
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:14,200
Where did they all go?

751
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:33,980
- Kwang Sook!
- Kwang Sook!

752
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:42,760
I slept so well.

753
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:49,600
Good morning, brothers-in-law.

754
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:51,700
Why did you sleep out here?

755
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:53,840
You're getting married today.

756
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:58,740
Oh, no.

757
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,380
Hurry. Get back inside.

758
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:04,610
- We should go too.
- Let's go!

759
00:49:29,570 --> 00:49:31,310
Ok Bun did a good job.

760
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:34,640
You look lovely.

761
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:37,210
Darn you.

762
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:39,820
What bride
drinks so much makgeolli...

763
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:42,380
on the night before her wedding?

764
00:49:47,090 --> 00:49:49,660
Anyway, I hope that this time,

765
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:52,660
you live happily...

766
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,770
for many years to come...

767
00:49:57,430 --> 00:49:58,970
until your hair turns white.

768
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:05,840
I'm sorry.

769
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:07,480
About what?

770
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:10,650
I know...

771
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:16,180
I put you through a lot.

772
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:18,920
I'm surprised you know.

773
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:20,420
Of course, I do.

774
00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:25,660
Thanks.

775
00:50:26,930 --> 00:50:29,100
You overcame
all those hard moments...

776
00:50:30,930 --> 00:50:32,470
and are now getting a fresh start.

777
00:50:33,370 --> 00:50:35,470
I'll die a happy woman now.

778
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:43,180
This was only possible
because I had you...

779
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:44,450
by my side.

780
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:46,720
You know that, right?

781
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,080
Yes.

782
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:52,090
Come on, don't cry.
Why are you crying on a happy day?

783
00:50:57,890 --> 00:50:59,800
Thank you, Mom.

784
00:51:01,030 --> 00:51:02,100
I'm so proud of you.

785
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:04,600
Mom...

786
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:15,110
Goodness.

787
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:17,510
You're here.

788
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:22,480
Congratulations.

789
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:23,650
Thank you.

790
00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:26,790
I'll leave you to talk, then.

791
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:28,790
- Thank you.
- I'll see you out there.

792
00:51:29,190 --> 00:51:30,230
Right.

793
00:51:31,990 --> 00:51:34,700
- You're here.
- Let's sit.

794
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:38,370
Congratulations.

795
00:51:41,470 --> 00:51:44,640
At first, I couldn't understand...

796
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:47,940
why Dong Seok fell
for someone like you.

797
00:51:49,310 --> 00:51:50,850
It makes sense to me now.

798
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:57,020
You radiate a healthy energy,

799
00:51:58,090 --> 00:52:00,520
and that must've touched his heart.

800
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:03,690
You touched mine as well.

801
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,230
Thank you.

802
00:52:10,530 --> 00:52:12,370
I've constantly worried...

803
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:14,900
about being able to fill the void...

804
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:17,440
my late daughter left behind,

805
00:52:18,370 --> 00:52:19,940
but those days are over now.

806
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:22,240
I have a feeling...

807
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:24,380
you'll do a good job
filling the void yourself.

808
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:29,890
It means so much to me
to get married...

809
00:52:30,590 --> 00:52:31,950
with your blessing.

810
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:35,490
Once I'm back in the US,
I won't worry about my family here,

811
00:52:35,490 --> 00:52:36,990
and I will focus on my treatment.

812
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:41,600
Have a wonderful life
with Dong Seok,

813
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:43,100
and don't argue so much.

814
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:44,900
I'll try,

815
00:52:45,930 --> 00:52:48,240
even though we'll probably argue
from time to time.

816
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:50,670
Even if you argue,

817
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:53,540
don't feel like
you always have to win.

818
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:55,140
Cut him some slack.

819
00:52:57,110 --> 00:52:59,810
Dong Seok may seem generous,

820
00:53:00,050 --> 00:53:02,650
but he can be petty sometimes.

821
00:53:04,650 --> 00:53:05,950
How did you know that?

822
00:53:05,950 --> 00:53:08,990
I'm his ex-mother-in-law.
So, of course, I know.

823
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:14,030
Now,

824
00:53:14,530 --> 00:53:17,530
we will begin
the wedding ceremony...

825
00:53:17,770 --> 00:53:20,840
of the groom,
Chairman Han Dong Seok,

826
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:22,770
and the bride, CEO Ma Kwang Sook.

827
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:29,980
Let's welcome the man
and woman of the hour.

828
00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:33,980
To start, Chairman Han Dong Seok
will walk down the aisle.

829
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:37,190
Please give him
a warm round of applause.

830
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:40,360
Here comes the groom!

831
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:02,110
Next, we will welcome
the most beautiful bride.

832
00:54:02,810 --> 00:54:05,410
CEO Ma Kwang Sook will enter.

833
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:11,620
Kwang Sook, it's too early
in the ceremony to cry.

834
00:54:12,150 --> 00:54:14,890
If you cry,
you'll make us cry as well.

835
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:18,890
Let's enter smiling
since it's a happy day.

836
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:22,460
Here comes the bride!

837
00:54:30,470 --> 00:54:31,740
Shall we?

838
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:58,470
Congratulations.

839
00:56:11,970 --> 00:56:13,040
I'm glad you came.

840
00:56:15,310 --> 00:56:17,350
Now, the bride and groom...

841
00:56:17,350 --> 00:56:19,880
will exchange rings
with all their hearts.

842
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:40,470
Next, the congratulatory speech
will be delivered.

843
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,470
On behalf of the bride's family,

844
00:56:42,470 --> 00:56:44,970
the eldest brother-in-law,
Oh Chun Soo,

845
00:56:44,970 --> 00:56:47,980
will deliver the speech.

846
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:57,050
Hello, everyone.

847
00:56:57,190 --> 00:57:00,920
I'm the brother-in-law...

848
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:02,190
of this beautiful bride.

849
00:57:02,890 --> 00:57:04,960
However,
I'm not Chairman Han's brother,

850
00:57:06,290 --> 00:57:09,100
but rather the brother
of her previous husband.

851
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,030
Sounds weird, doesn't it?

852
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:16,170
Of course. Even I'd find it weird...

853
00:57:16,170 --> 00:57:18,340
if I didn't know the whole story.

854
00:57:19,170 --> 00:57:20,810
You see, my older brother...

855
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:23,080
left us for good...

856
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:27,120
just ten days
after marrying Kwang Sook.

857
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:31,620
At the time,
he was the CEO of a brewery.

858
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:33,820
After his death,

859
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:37,090
when the brewery
faced financial troubles...

860
00:57:37,290 --> 00:57:38,330
and had to close,

861
00:57:39,090 --> 00:57:41,230
Kwang Sook took over.

862
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:44,870
She reunited all his brothers,
who had been living apart,

863
00:57:44,870 --> 00:57:47,070
and brought them back home.

864
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:49,140
She endured...

865
00:57:51,170 --> 00:57:52,370
and stood strong.

866
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:02,280
Through her efforts,

867
00:58:04,490 --> 00:58:05,850
this beautiful bride...

868
00:58:06,990 --> 00:58:08,060
made the brewery...

869
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,160
what it is today.

870
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:17,000
During that time,

871
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,670
my brother over there and I
got married.

872
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:24,140
She's the magician
who made all of this happen.

873
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:28,980
She is...

874
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:33,550
today's beautiful bride.

875
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:37,490
On this wonderful day,

876
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:39,990
I wanted to thank her...

877
00:58:39,990 --> 00:58:42,720
on behalf
of all her brothers-in-law.

878
00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:44,960
That's why I stand here today.

879
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:48,630
Kwang Sook.

880
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:54,700
Thank you.

881
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:03,950
Kwang Sook.

882
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:06,850
Thank you.

883
00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:09,280
Be happy.

884
00:59:10,690 --> 00:59:13,660
I sincerely congratulate you
on your wedding.

885
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:43,920
You are truly beautiful

886
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:48,590
You shine brighter
than the stars in the sky

887
00:59:49,490 --> 00:59:54,200
You, who warmly embrace
my worn-out heart

888
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:58,600
Your embrace is my home

889
00:59:59,130 --> 01:00:04,410
I thought the strong wind
would blow out our love

890
01:00:04,410 --> 01:00:08,180
But we put up with it
and got through it well

891
01:00:08,910 --> 01:00:14,150
Do you know?
I'm so grateful I could cry

892
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:18,590
Because you are by my side

893
01:00:18,590 --> 01:00:23,420
- I love you
- I love you

894
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:28,330
- I know I'm not good enough for you
- I know I'm not good enough for you

895
01:00:28,330 --> 01:00:30,870
If we spend time together

896
01:00:30,870 --> 01:00:33,740
We will get weary

897
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:37,970
But I will be your resting place

898
01:00:37,970 --> 01:00:40,480
- I love you
- I love you

899
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:42,910
- Thank you, my love
- Thank you, my love

900
01:00:42,910 --> 01:00:47,720
- I sing this only for you forever
- I sing this only for you forever

901
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:52,590
Let's sing this love song together

902
01:00:52,590 --> 01:00:57,430
- The two of us
- The two of us

903
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:02,630
Bride and groom, march.

904
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:44,470
One, two, three.

905
01:02:56,580 --> 01:02:57,980
Smile, everyone.

906
01:02:58,780 --> 01:03:00,210
Look over here.

907
01:03:00,650 --> 01:03:02,680
Are you ready? One, two.

908
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:11,830
(For Eagle Brothers)

909
01:03:12,030 --> 01:03:13,390
If you catch the bouquet,

910
01:03:13,390 --> 01:03:15,830
you know you have
six months to marry, right?

911
01:03:15,830 --> 01:03:18,770
It's your turn next.

912
01:03:19,370 --> 01:03:21,040
You're not exactly young.

913
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:22,700
Work hard and speed things up.

914
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:25,140
What's there to speed up with
when we're married?

915
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:26,840
You should have a baby.

916
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:28,780
When you have a child of your own,

917
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:31,480
you'll understand how I feel.

918
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:33,310
Could I give away...

919
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:35,050
a beautiful daughter like you
to just anyone?

920
01:03:35,180 --> 01:03:37,150
Did you call me to say that?

921
01:03:37,450 --> 01:03:39,890
Why is this the last time?
Are you going somewhere to die?

922
01:03:40,020 --> 01:03:41,490
I'm not going off to die.

923
01:03:41,490 --> 01:03:43,190
But I am scared, Mi Ae.
