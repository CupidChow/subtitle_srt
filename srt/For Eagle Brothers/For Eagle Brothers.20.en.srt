00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:02,970
(Episode 20)

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:04,680
Okay.

3
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,620
- Yes?
- This is LX Hotel in Sokcho.

4
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:16,590
I called to see where you were.

5
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:19,560
I just exited the freeway...

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,130
and got on to the national highway.

7
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,290
I'll be there in 30 minutes.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,600
(Eagle Brewery)

9
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:30,000
I'll make her mine today...

10
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,740
no matter what.

11
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,140
I'm going to end my life
as a bachelor today.

12
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,610
I wouldn't have bothered
if I hadn't heard him,

13
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:41,410
but since I did,

14
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,450
I can't let him get away with it.

15
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,120
What the...

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,120
(Loss of tire pressure:)

17
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,620
(Cannot operate.
Carefully stop the vehicle.)

18
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:49,020
Darn.

19
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,390
I don't have the time for this.

20
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:54,960
My gosh.

21
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:01,130
The car kept showing a warning
about a tire.

22
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:05,170
I turned on the hazard light
and pulled over.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,010
Call the maintenance team...

24
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,140
and request assistance
from the insurance company.

25
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,210
Yes, please hurry.

26
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,850
(Eagle Brewery)

27
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:28,330
Unbelievable.

28
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:35,900
Darn.

29
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:39,500
(Chun Soo)

30
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,010
Hey, Chun Soo.

31
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,240
I'll soon be delivering
my presentation.

32
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:48,610
Don't be too nervous
and show them what you've got.

33
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:50,520
If they agree to stock their stores
with our makgeolli,

34
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,820
that'll be more money for us.

35
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:54,490
If not,
we'll have more time to relax.

36
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,720
Okay?

37
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,260
Sure. Got it.

38
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:01,730
I'm Oh Chun Soo,
Vice-CEO of Eagle Brewery.

39
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,130
Feel So Good is Korea's
leading convenience store franchise,

40
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,170
and I appreciate this opportunity
to introduce you to our product.

41
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,540
(Supply Proposal Screening
for the Second Half of 2025)

42
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:16,140
(A traditional brewery
passed down through 3 generations)

43
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,540
We, at Eagle Brewery, adhere to
traditional brewing methods.

44
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:20,810
Although the operation is small,

45
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,380
we aim to provide drinks
of the best quality.

46
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,280
(Purity and Sincerity)

47
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,320
We took a modern approach
to the tradition...

48
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,620
that's been passed down
through three generations.

49
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:32,220
The perfect balance...

50
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,590
of natural sweetness,

51
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,590
a healthy acidity,
and refreshing bubbles...

52
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,690
is the main ingredient...

53
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:37,800
of Eagle Brewery's
Jang-Kwang Makgeolli.

54
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,630
I believe with absolute certainty...

55
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:44,270
that its clean yet rich flavors
can be loved and appreciated...

56
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,470
by general consumers.

57
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,310
Come in.

58
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:57,680
What are you trying to do now?

59
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,020
You weren't answering my calls.

60
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,990
What other choice did I have?

61
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,120
This is school.

62
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,860
I thought you at least had
that level of sense.

63
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,830
This was the only way
I could see you.

64
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,630
I already told you
there's no business left between us.

65
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,100
My wedding is this Saturday.

66
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:17,740
And?

67
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,900
Just this one time.

68
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,610
Let me see Ha Ni before I wed.

69
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,540
Please.

70
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,280
As if seeing her once
will change anything.

71
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,020
It'll only mess with your head
before the wedding.

72
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:36,790
Don't act like
you're doing this for my sake.

73
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,790
It won't end
with seeing her just this once.

74
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,090
You're going to come up
with all sorts of excuses...

75
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:42,590
to ask me to let you see Ha Ni
whenever you want.

76
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,030
Am I wrong?

77
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,600
You're wrong.

78
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,170
I won't do that, Beom Soo.

79
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:55,840
This will be the last time.

80
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,810
Please allow it just this once.

81
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,650
Please let me see Ha Ni
one last time.

82
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,180
I'm begging you.

83
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,720
Please. Just this once.

84
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,700
I'm sorry.
I didn't know you had company.

85
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,570
She was on her way out.

86
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,540
You don't need to leave.

87
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:30,510
Call me.

88
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,510
I'll be waiting.

89
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,540
Professor.

90
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,080
Yes?

91
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:09,810
Here you go.

92
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:14,090
You seem to be in a sour mood.

93
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:19,290
Having this at times like that
always puts me in a better mood.

94
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,030
If you let it dissolve slowly
in your mouth,

95
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:28,300
you'll forget about your troubles
by the time you're almost done.

96
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:31,940
Sure. I'll have it sometime later.

97
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:53,160
Ha Ni. Did you have fun with Se Ri?

98
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,230
It was hard work, wasn't it?

99
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,000
That's not what Se Ri is like.

100
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,370
Something is definitely going on.

101
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,870
I know my puppy better than anyone.

102
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,210
Hello, Mother.

103
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:18,580
How does it feel now that
you'll be discharged tomorrow?

104
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:20,020
I have mixed feelings.

105
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:23,550
By the way, I still haven't been
able to talk to Se Ri.

106
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:27,430
She caught a cold
and suffered throughout the night.

107
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,330
She's just fallen asleep.

108
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:30,800
Did she see a doctor?

109
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:32,830
I'm going to take her to one...

110
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,700
after she wakes up
and eats something.

111
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:37,440
By the looks of it this morning,
her fever was gone,

112
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,800
and she seemed to be doing better.

113
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,010
She hasn't been taking my calls
since yesterday,

114
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:42,610
which had me worried.

115
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:43,810
My gosh.

116
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,540
Se Ri was thrilled...

117
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,680
about throwing you
a surprise welcome home party,

118
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,350
but she ended up catching a cold.

119
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:52,050
You have no idea
how upset she's been.

120
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,750
She didn't have to do that.

121
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,620
Please tell her
not to worry about it.

122
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,360
Actually,

123
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:01,130
you finally coming back to Seoul...

124
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:03,730
is all the surprise she needs.

125
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,640
Thank you.

126
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,040
- Drive safely.
- Okay.

127
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,760
(Eagle Brewery Unrefined Makgeolli)

128
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,230
The general manager
couldn't attend the event...

129
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,800
because he had an important meeting.

130
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,800
He asked me to tell you
how grateful he was.

131
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,970
We are honored to be able
to introduce our liquor...

132
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,570
to such an important event.

133
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,570
Word about its popularity in Seoul
has made its way here.

134
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,470
Since this is a hotel
affiliated with the same company,

135
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,680
we have quite a few customers
who ask for Jang-Kwang Makgeolli.

136
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,150
So we got curious
and asked for the delivery.

137
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:57,620
I'm so happy
that word about our liquor...

138
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,950
has made its way here.

139
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,190
(Daughter)

140
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,730
Hi, Mom.

141
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:11,330
Hey. Did you arrive in Sokcho yet?

142
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:14,100
Yes. I just delivered the liquor
and am on my way out.

143
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,330
Did you meet Sang Nam?

144
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,900
Why would I meet Sang Nam?

145
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,110
Kwang Sook!

146
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,280
I'll call you later, Mom.

147
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:28,780
What are you doing here?

148
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:31,520
I got the news
that you were coming to Sokcho,

149
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,150
so I came running.

150
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,490
How did you know?

151
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,460
Was it my mom who told you that?

152
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,790
Of course.

153
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:44,300
She generously offered her support
so we could be together.

154
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,860
This is driving me crazy.

155
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:48,730
Now that we're here,

156
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,100
why don't we go
and have some mulhoe?

157
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,170
I haven't had lunch yet,

158
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:54,110
so my stomach is growling.

159
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:57,410
I'm busy with work,
so I have to go back to Seoul.

160
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:58,780
Enjoy your meal.

161
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,510
Wait, Kwang Sook!

162
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,850
Slow down, Kwang Sook.

163
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,020
You might fly away in the wind.

164
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:08,550
Kwang Sook.

165
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,590
Wait.

166
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,360
(Eagle Brewery)

167
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,090
Wait, Kwang Sook.

168
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,460
How can you be so fast?

169
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,260
What do you think you're doing?

170
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,600
I came all the way here
just to see you.

171
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,230
Don't be so harsh on me.

172
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,000
I didn't ask you to come.

173
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,140
I wish we could go
to see the ocean...

174
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,780
and go up Mount Seorak
though I can't see it from here.

175
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,780
But I'm holding back and asking you
to just have some mulhoe with me.

176
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,410
Am I asking for too much?

177
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,980
I don't have time for any of that.

178
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:40,280
Please enjoy it all you want
before going back.

179
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:43,960
What... Wait.

180
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,460
Kwang Sook.

181
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:49,130
My goodness.

182
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,130
All right.

183
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,300
Let's go.

184
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,750
(Eagle Brewery)

185
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,320
I guess I came too late.

186
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,830
You said
you'd just have some mulhoe.

187
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,440
What's all this?

188
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,340
It's not like
we can come here often.

189
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:40,010
Now that we're here,
we should try a variety of food.

190
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,710
You can't eat stuff like this
in Seoul.

191
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,150
Have a seat.

192
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,220
Come on.

193
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:56,860
I have to go back quickly,

194
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,960
so I'll go on ahead
after finishing it.

195
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:01,100
- Here.
- No.

196
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,730
I have to drive.

197
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,270
I'll make sure you get home safely
with a chauffeur service,

198
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,610
so don't worry and just drink.

199
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:12,040
It's too far from here to my place.

200
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,280
How would we use
a chauffeur service?

201
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:16,080
Here. Would you pour me a drink?

202
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,280
You can have this.

203
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,690
I just want to have a drink
that you pour me.

204
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:30,530
It's just one drink, okay?

205
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,130
Pour it yourself after this.

206
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,230
All right. Cheers.

207
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,270
Forget it. I'm not drinking.

208
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:43,510
Drinking alone brings bad luck
to the person in front of you.

209
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:45,680
Can't you just pretend
to play along?

210
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:47,950
Please.

211
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:49,680
Come on.

212
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:57,860
Bottoms up.

213
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:03,230
- Oh, dear.
- What are you doing?

214
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,960
I was just messing around.

215
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:08,130
I'm sorry if you didn't like it.
I apologize.

216
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,600
I won't ask you to drink again.

217
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,900
Just enjoy your food.

218
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,010
My goodness.

219
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:20,380
It tastes so good as it's from you.

220
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:22,610
My gosh. Look at this.

221
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,480
The sashimi is so fresh and bouncy.

222
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:26,450
Try it.

223
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:29,390
No thanks. I'll eat it myself.

224
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,230
(Takeout sashimi available)

225
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,260
Yes.

226
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,030
I need you to stay there...

227
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:42,530
and take care of things
until the festival is over.

228
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,500
I'll be going back soon.

229
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,140
Okay. I'll talk to you later.

230
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,910
Kwang Sook, have some more.

231
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:55,150
Welcome. How many are you with?

232
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,220
Chairman Han!

233
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:04,960
What are you doing here?

234
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,220
I came to check things...

235
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,260
for the event at the hotel
and was on my way back.

236
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:12,030
I was stopping by
to have a quick meal.

237
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,470
It's good to see you again,
Mr. Park.

238
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,770
Yes, Chairman Han. We meet again.

239
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:23,210
Why don't you join us for dinner?

240
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:25,780
I also came to deliver
the makgeolli to the hotel.

241
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,380
And I ran into Mr. Park there,

242
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,510
so we were having a meal
on the way back.

243
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,320
Do you not mind me joining you?

244
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,390
I hope I'm not interrupting you.

245
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:39,520
It's not like that. Please join us.

246
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:42,390
Then please excuse me for a moment.

247
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:43,730
Sure.

248
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:53,070
The Traditional Liquor Festival
must be taking place now.

249
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,370
I just talked to Manager Park
on the phone.

250
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:57,610
He says people are showing
enthusiastic responses.

251
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,110
Really?

252
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:01,910
"The refreshing bubbles..."

253
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:05,820
"go very well with the seasoning
of Korean food."

254
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,490
"It feels like
drinking Korean nature."

255
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,160
It's getting a lot of good reviews.

256
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:14,590
The theme of our liquor
is the healthy taste of nature.

257
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:17,130
It's amazing
that people from other countries...

258
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:18,500
feel the same way.

259
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,900
Mr. Chairman, please let me
fill your glass.

260
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,270
I should go back to Seoul,
so I'm not drinking.

261
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,440
Excuse me.

262
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,110
I got a video from Manager Park.

263
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:38,520
I think you should watch it with me.

264
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,790
He is an American reporter
for a business newspaper...

265
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,560
who is well-known
as a wine enthusiast,

266
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:49,890
He filmed a video...

267
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,730
after drinking Jang-Kwang Makgeolli
and just posted it on his website.

268
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I discovered
this incredible drink tonight.

269
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:01,810
Jang-Kwang Makgeolli.

270
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:07,440
It tastes like champagne
infused with Korean rains.

271
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,180
What is he saying?

272
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:15,150
He is praising Jang-Kwang Makgeolli
for containing...

273
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:19,090
the clear and cool taste
of Korean water.

274
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,760
What nonsense.

275
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:24,830
Gosh, that feels really good.

276
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,170
You've done a great job, Ms. Ma.

277
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:32,870
Are you praising me right now?

278
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:37,570
My goodness. You just praised me.

279
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,910
I can't believe this is happening.

280
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,680
Excuse me!
Give me another bottle of soju.

281
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,950
That's enough.
You already finished two bottles.

282
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:52,890
Don't mind me.

283
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:07,600
Did she meet Sang Nam?

284
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,040
Mrs. Gong.

285
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,880
My goodness.

286
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:18,620
What are you doing here, Mr. Go?

287
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,480
May I use your stove?

288
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,790
I got this
from my favorite restaurant,

289
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:25,020
but it got cold on the way here,
so I want to heat it up.

290
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,290
- Go ahead.
- Thank you.

291
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,240
What's in it?

292
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,270
It's a beef radish soup.

293
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:43,640
Beef radish soup?

294
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,240
Is it for a memorial service?

295
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,280
It's the anniversary
of my late wife and son's death.

296
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:54,990
Goodness.

297
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:45,100
You looked after Ha Ni
and put her to sleep.

298
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,770
Your babysitting skills
were excellent.

299
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,940
I guess you were a doting father.

300
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:08,830
How about we get back to Seoul?

301
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:12,860
Yes. Can I drop by
the ladies' room first?

302
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,210
Chairman Han.

303
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:24,880
Shall we talk?

304
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:27,540
Sure.

305
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:45,300
How could you, Chairman Han?

306
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:47,730
What do you mean?

307
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:50,130
I had the table set.

308
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,970
You barged in and joined in,

309
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:56,440
and ruined the scene.
Why did you go and do that?

310
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:59,210
Get to the point
so I can understand.

311
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:00,540
Don't beat around the bush.

312
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:03,110
You don't seem to know,

313
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,320
but Kwang Sook and I met...

314
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,820
on a blind date with the possibility
of marriage in the future.

315
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:12,420
I have the staunch backing
of Kwang Sook's mother,

316
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:14,630
and we have a serious relationship.

317
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:17,900
So what?

318
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:21,670
What do you mean, "so what?"

319
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:23,970
How clueless could you be?

320
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:25,870
I gave you this signal.

321
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,210
I gave it to you many times.

322
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:31,010
Shouldn't you have left
and gone on your way?

323
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,910
I have no intention of doing that.

324
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:41,020
You have no intention of doing that?

325
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:45,120
What are you playing at?

326
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:49,290
Do you have feelings...

327
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:51,660
for Kwang Sook by any chance?

328
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:59,500
Why can't you answer?

329
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:04,640
What's going on?
Are you dating in secret?

330
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,380
No, but...

331
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:10,150
What do you mean, "no?"

332
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:12,350
I can tell at a glance!

333
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:17,220
When did you fall for each other?

334
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,960
When did you get together
behind my back?

335
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,190
What are you on about?

336
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,100
I'll call a taxi to take you home.

337
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,360
You're drunk, Mr. Park.

338
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,630
So you can get rid of me
and get up to no good?

339
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,040
You're a messy drunk.

340
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,740
You can't act like this
around Chairman Han.

341
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:38,840
I thought you were acting fishy.

342
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,780
You're here on purpose, aren't you?

343
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,580
I did free my schedule to come here.

344
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,690
See? I was right.

345
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:54,420
CEO Ma runs a company
that supplies my hotel,

346
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:58,600
and I didn't want anything untoward
to happen to her.

347
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:00,560
So I came to protect her.

348
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:03,030
What a joke.

349
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,600
Why does she need protection?

350
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,840
Do you think I'd gobble her up?

351
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,210
I know you came here
with exactly that intention.

352
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,810
Do you read minds or something?

353
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:14,880
Can you see through me?

354
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,910
How do you know what I'm thinking?

355
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:18,480
In the men's toilet,

356
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:22,420
I happened to hear you
on the phone with a friend.

357
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:25,760
I met this woman
on a blind date recently,

358
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:28,690
but she's playing hard to get.

359
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:31,660
I'm going to finish it off today.

360
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,960
With some soju...

361
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:37,300
I will make a hole-in-one today.

362
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,710
Once I'd heard that nonsense,

363
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,110
I couldn't let you
get up to your tricks.

364
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:51,750
Now do you see why I'm here?

365
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,020
You crazy...

366
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,420
That's why you tried
to get me to drink...

367
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,290
when I didn't want to.

368
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:01,260
What do you take me for?

369
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,190
You darn psycho!

370
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:06,200
I'm a darn psycho?
Is that all you can say?

371
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,470
Yes, that's all I can say. So what?

372
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,900
Kwang Sook. It's not like that.

373
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,370
Let go of me or else!

374
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:14,270
- Come on. Kwang Sook.
- Let go!

375
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:15,310
Take your hands off her!

376
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,210
- Let's go.
- Wait.

377
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,050
So what if you're a chairman?

378
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:27,650
Why are you causing trouble
by getting in my way and my affairs?

379
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:29,920
What's wrong with you?
Let go of him!

380
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,560
You humiliated me.

381
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,990
You crushed the ego
of Macho Man Park Sang Nam.

382
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,700
Let's talk it out.
Let go of my jacket.

383
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,800
No.

384
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:48,310
Let's go.

385
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:57,480
Are you out of your mind?

386
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,520
Are you all right, sir?

387
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,050
I'm fine. It's nothing.

388
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:05,860
I let you off for being a chairman,
but I shouldn't.

389
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:08,530
Let's fight man to man.

390
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:15,030
What is the matter with you?

391
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,500
Step back. You could get hurt.

392
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,500
Chairman Han.

393
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:48,200
Did you train in hapkido
or taekwondo?

394
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:50,700
Judo.

395
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:04,580
I could flatten you with one punch.

396
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:10,390
Get this out of my face!

397
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,720
Take this off!

398
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,590
Pull anything stupid again...

399
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:16,360
and I'll call the police on you!

400
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,530
Are you two ganging up on me?

401
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,470
What's the matter, sir?

402
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,170
It's my back.

403
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:30,070
Did you hurt it again?

404
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:32,180
I must've sprained it.

405
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,540
Shall I call an ambulance?

406
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,050
No, it's not that bad.

407
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:39,050
Can you walk?

408
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:10,210
(Eagle Brewery)

409
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,560
You must be used
to riding fancy cars.

410
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:20,020
This is uncomfortable, isn't it?

411
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,390
It's not exactly comfortable.

412
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:25,200
Drive slowly and gently.

413
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:27,530
Okay. I'll do that.

414
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:37,110
Was that...

415
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:39,340
deliberate?

416
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:43,510
Of course not.

417
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,980
I'll drive more carefully.

418
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:47,920
And slowly too.

419
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:52,560
You know what?

420
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:56,030
To be honest,
I was a little touched.

421
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:59,030
About what?

422
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:01,830
You came all the way here
to stop Park Sang Nam...

423
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:03,300
from mistreating me.

424
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:08,640
I had no idea you had a caring side.

425
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:12,610
If a supplier of my hotel...

426
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:14,210
were at the heart
of a dirty scandal,

427
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:18,580
it could damage
the hotel's reputation.

428
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:21,950
Either way,

429
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:24,150
I'm grateful.

430
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,460
Would it have killed you...

431
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,130
to go on a blind date
with someone decent?

432
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:30,760
Why did it have to be a punk
like him?

433
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,570
I think you have a bad taste in men.

434
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:37,330
I already told you about this.

435
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:40,900
My mom pushed me
to go on a blind date with him.

436
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,050
(Chun Soo)

437
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,050
Excuse me while I take this call.

438
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,120
Hey, Chun Soo.

439
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:00,620
Kwang Sook,

440
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,560
I wrapped up the presentation,

441
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,260
and I'm on my way home.

442
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:06,030
Good job.

443
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,970
Things went well,
and the screening panelists...

444
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:10,330
seemed fond of our product.

445
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:12,400
Wait. Really?

446
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,240
We'll have to wait
for an answer though.

447
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,310
According to the supervisor,

448
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:18,880
even if they agree
to stock our product,

449
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:21,750
things can go awry due to issues
with quantity and unit price.

450
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:25,220
We'll need to discuss it internally.

451
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,980
Okay. Consider me informed.

452
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:30,290
Be careful on the road...

453
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:32,760
and get some shut-eye
at a rest area...

454
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,020
if you feel sleepy.

455
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,860
Take your time coming home.

456
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,660
Right. Will do.

457
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:39,100
Good.

458
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:45,200
Right. That was
my eldest brother-in-law.

459
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:48,870
He was Head of Investments
at Hanseong Securities...

460
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:50,140
but quit his job.

461
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:54,140
A few days ago, he was appointed
as Vice-CEO of Eagle Brewery.

462
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:59,250
Isn't it uncomfortable
to work with your brother-in-law?

463
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:01,120
Not at all.

464
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:03,950
The brewery has been
in the family...

465
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:05,820
since the time
of my grandfather-in-law.

466
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,160
Of course, my brother-in-law
should be a part of it.

467
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:12,700
Weren't you worried
about taking over the brewery...

468
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:15,000
since you had no experience?

469
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,740
My husband...

470
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:23,370
poured his life into this brewery,

471
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,740
and I couldn't let it vanish.

472
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,880
But most of all,

473
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,310
the brewery was in a pile of debt...

474
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,580
because of how he brewed
liquor of fine quality...

475
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:32,480
regardless of the cost.

476
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,250
I didn't want people
to think of him...

477
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:38,760
as an irresponsible man...

478
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,320
who caused trouble for others.

479
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,460
What on earth?

480
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:51,900
My gosh. When did you get here?

481
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:54,200
A second ago.

482
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:55,900
I must've dozed off.

483
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:58,100
You should've woken me up.

484
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,800
I didn't want
to interrupt your sleep.

485
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:06,440
Wait. What's this?

486
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,880
I owe you for the presentation...

487
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,550
and wanted to thank you.

488
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,420
Come on.
No need to say that between friends.

489
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:16,920
Did it go well?
What do you think they'll say?

490
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,490
I did my best,

491
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,320
but I won't know until they call.

492
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:24,390
Right. I'm sure
things will work out for you.

493
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,900
I was actually a bit hungry.

494
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,800
- Can I have this right now?
- Sure.

495
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,240
What is it?

496
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,210
Gosh, what's this?

497
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:38,880
Are you sure this is cake?

498
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,950
They're so pretty.
It'd be a shame to eat them.

499
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,710
I'll get you more when I can.

500
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,480
Now, eat them
before customers show up.

501
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:49,120
Really? Will you get me some more?

502
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:51,960
I will. Now, eat.

503
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,760
Here.

504
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,160
My gosh. No way.

505
00:30:58,490 --> 00:30:59,560
Have some.

506
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,460
I'm good. Have it yourself.

507
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:04,630
You must've been tense
and exhausted all day, so go on.

508
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:06,840
I got it for you, so eat first.

509
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,270
Go on.

510
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:09,570
- No, you have it.
- Come on.

511
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:10,610
I said I was fine.

512
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,910
- Seriously?
- Hey.

513
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,180
There won't be any feeding.

514
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,190
Sure. Sounds good to me.

515
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:33,660
Try it.

516
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:36,030
Look how pretty this is.

517
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:37,330
My gosh.

518
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,100
It's so good.

519
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,270
- Is it good?
- Yes.

520
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:43,970
Have some too.

521
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,740
There's fruit inside.

522
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,810
Are you on your way home?

523
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:51,880
Yes, I just left Sokcho.

524
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,680
It's dangerous to drive in the dark.

525
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:55,650
Are you okay?

526
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:58,150
No one can drive
like your sister-in-law,

527
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:00,020
so don't you worry.

528
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,430
By the way,
how did the job interview go?

529
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:05,400
I think I did fine,

530
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,860
but who knows
what they thought of me?

531
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,470
Don't let it eat away at you.

532
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,630
It's that company's loss...

533
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:12,970
for not seeing your value.

534
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:16,870
Drive home safely.
I'll stay up waiting.

535
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:20,040
Sure. See you later.

536
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,410
Got it.

537
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:23,310
(Kang Soo)

538
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:25,980
That was my youngest brother-in-law.

539
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,690
I heard you met him the other day.

540
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,960
He appeared to be trustworthy
and reliable.

541
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:34,520
Absolutely.

542
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:37,130
On top of that,
he's good-looking with a hot body.

543
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,000
My daughter said...

544
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,140
that he reminded her of me
in my younger years.

545
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,020
He must be looking for a job.

546
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,550
Yes.

547
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:07,260
Any company that hires
my youngest brother-in-law...

548
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,830
will have hit the jackpot.

549
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:16,970
Goodness.
You're getting calls nonstop.

550
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,670
It's my second brother-in-law.

551
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:21,940
I'll take one last call.

552
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,310
Hey, Heung Soo.

553
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,340
Kwang Sook!

554
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:32,550
What's wrong, Heung Soo?
Is something up?

555
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:34,650
Seon Ah...

556
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:38,250
I think Seon Ah
changed her mind about me.

557
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:44,390
She's been dodging my calls
for days.

558
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:49,030
Goodness me.

559
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:52,840
Oh, dear.

560
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,180
I didn't do anything to upset her,

561
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,610
so how could she do this to me?

562
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:07,920
What did I do that was wrong?

563
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:11,420
How could she be this cruel?

564
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:14,960
Goodness, Heung Soo.
I feel terrible.

565
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:18,030
Gosh, poor you.

566
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,280
What brings you here at this hour?

567
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:38,310
I was packing.

568
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:40,250
But it's too late.

569
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:43,190
The people in the neighborhood
could see me.

570
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:47,420
I thought it'd be best
to leave quietly.

571
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:50,930
Where are you headed?

572
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:53,160
To Cheongju.

573
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,600
That's where my mom is from.

574
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,040
Did you meet Mr. Oh?

575
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:08,710
Can you explain it to him
so that he understands?

576
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:12,980
I'll get going.

577
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:25,500
(Reliable Movers)

578
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:28,130
I'll be right behind you,
so please head out.

579
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,270
Sure.

580
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:36,240
Wait!

581
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:45,580
We just talked a second ago.
What do you want?

582
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,920
I couldn't let you leave
without saying goodbye.

583
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:50,590
I came to see you off.

584
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:53,690
Why is that? Did you think
I'd lie about leaving...

585
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:55,420
and stay behind?

586
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,460
You and your choice of words.

587
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,100
Unbelievable.

588
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:01,400
- I'll get going.
- Wait.

589
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,570
What is this?

590
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,910
This isn't much.

591
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:14,210
Buy some snacks for your daughter
at the service area.

592
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:16,710
You already got me the premium.
You don't have to do this.

593
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:21,380
Thank you for everything.

594
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,350
Mom.

595
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:26,460
I'm sleepy.

596
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:29,660
You can sleep on your grandma's lap
in the back seat.

597
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:31,730
I'll wake you up once we get there.

598
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:32,900
Okay, Mom.

599
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:39,000
I told her to call me Mom.

600
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,840
What I've done to my kid
is just horrible.

601
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:43,710
Good for you.

602
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:49,380
Eun Seo,
if you want to get a perm later,

603
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,350
you can come to my salon anytime.

604
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:53,380
I'll do it for free.

605
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,520
Are you serious?

606
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,890
Yes. I promise.

607
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:58,890
This is so exciting.

608
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,430
I should get going now.

609
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:18,570
Take good care of Heung Soo.

610
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,940
Why would you worry about my man?

611
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:26,420
Take care.

612
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:27,680
You should go.

613
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:45,940
So how many brothers-in-law
do you have?

614
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,570
There are four.

615
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:52,580
And I think of them as my brothers,
not as my in-laws.

616
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:55,140
How is that possible?

617
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,710
Why would it be impossible?

618
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,520
They're my husband's brothers.

619
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,950
That means they're my brothers.

620
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:07,920
We are Five Eagle Siblings.

621
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:10,630
Five Eagle Siblings?

622
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:14,030
The five siblings of Eagle Brewery.

623
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,730
(Eagle Brewery)

624
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:17,370
Five Eagle Siblings.

625
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,470
It sounds grandiose.

626
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:25,010
What about you?

627
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,210
Are you close to your in-laws?

628
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,420
My wife and my mother
weren't on very good terms.

629
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:39,490
So even now, my mother-in-law thinks
that my wife got cancer...

630
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:42,290
because of my late mother.

631
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:46,900
I always feel...

632
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:50,630
guilty and indebted
to my mother-in-law.

633
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:56,010
Does she live close to you?

634
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,040
She's in LA.

635
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,850
I see.

636
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:06,680
By the way,

637
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:11,820
can we stop by a restroom?

638
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:14,860
Oh, sure.

639
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:18,790
There will be a service area soon,
so hold on for a bit.

640
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:31,210
(Goyang Service Area)

641
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:34,210
(Eagle Brewery)

642
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:52,260
Gosh, it's okay.

643
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:55,030
Hold my hand.
It's high, so it's hard to get off.

644
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,480
What's wrong?
Does your back hurt again?

645
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,920
No, no. It's okay.

646
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:26,430
I'm fine. I can walk by myself.

647
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,330
Come on. You can barely walk now.

648
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:31,670
I'll take you to the restroom.

649
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:41,740
This is driving me crazy.

650
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:51,120
(Men's room)

651
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,320
It's really okay now.

652
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:54,820
I can go in by myself.

653
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:57,630
Are you sure
you can do this on your own?

654
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:01,760
What if I can't?

655
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,370
Will you do it for me?

656
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:11,270
I guess you're right.

657
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:15,710
Go ahead and relieve yourself then.

658
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:25,890
What?

659
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:28,460
Good.

660
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:35,330
It's a toy claw machine.

661
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:38,070
Let me see.

662
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:42,540
Okay. Let me begin.

663
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:51,450
Good. This is it.

664
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:55,280
Yes. I knew it. Go, Ma Kwang Sook!

665
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,090
That was so close.

666
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:06,630
All right. Let me try it again.

667
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:13,770
What is she doing there?

668
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:15,200
I think this is working.

669
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,610
It's working.

670
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:18,670
Yes!

671
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:21,910
Gosh, why is it so hard?

672
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:26,780
You have to make it this time,
Ma Kwang Sook.

673
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,180
You can do this.

674
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,450
It's working this time.

675
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:32,450
You look like a little kid.
What are you doing?

676
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:37,160
Do you see
this pretty thing in pink here?

677
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:39,360
This is popular these days.

678
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,800
So?

679
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,430
I want to give it to Ha Ni.

680
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:44,330
Ha Ni?

681
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:47,740
She's the daughter
of my third brother-in-law.

682
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:50,470
Let me try it one more time.

683
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:52,340
I think I can make it this time.

684
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:53,780
Hang on.

685
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:54,980
Again.

686
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:57,150
It seems like it will work,
but I keep failing.

687
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:01,220
Yes!

688
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:09,830
Don't go all the way...

689
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:12,030
to get it at once.

690
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,400
Go a little to the right at a time.

691
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:17,270
No, it's the left. To the right.

692
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:19,670
Now, it should come forward.

693
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:21,370
Then shake it a little.

694
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:23,740
Pull it up now
and move it to the exit.

695
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:26,410
No, to the right.

696
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:28,940
It should go down a little.

697
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:32,050
- So close.
- Gently, as if you sweep it.

698
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:33,380
I guess you don't fish.

699
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:37,050
It's easy if you know how it works.

700
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:38,050
My gosh.

701
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:39,920
You're really naggy.

702
00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:42,320
Why don't you give it a try?

703
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:18,990
Please.

704
00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:10,350
No way!

705
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:11,650
You're awesome, sir!

706
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:15,720
- Well done!
- Oh, dear.

707
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:21,460
You have the golden touch.

708
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:25,130
High-five.

709
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:40,310
Let's get going, then.

710
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:43,350
- Let me prop you up.
- No.

711
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:46,950
Don't touch my body at all.

712
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:51,190
Wait in the truck, then.

713
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:52,790
I'll make just one more call.

714
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,490
Who do you need to call now?

715
00:45:57,690 --> 00:45:59,160
Hello, it's me.

716
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,330
Hi, Kwang Sook.

717
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:04,300
Where are you?

718
00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:07,570
I'm on the way back to Seoul
after making a delivery.

719
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:09,870
Ta-da.

720
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:12,140
What's that?

721
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:15,310
I found a claw machine
at the service area.

722
00:46:15,310 --> 00:46:16,780
I got something for Ha Ni.

723
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:18,650
Is she asleep?

724
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:19,850
No, not yet.

725
00:46:20,450 --> 00:46:22,380
Ha Ni, it's your auntie.

726
00:46:22,450 --> 00:46:23,450
Ha Ni.

727
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:27,220
I got you a plushie.

728
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:29,390
What do you think? Is it pretty?

729
00:46:30,890 --> 00:46:32,900
Thank you, Kwang Sook.

730
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:34,460
Are you doing well?

731
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:35,560
Yes, of course.

732
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:39,130
Come over with Ha Ni
if you're free this weekend.

733
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:40,300
I'll give her the plushie.

734
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,370
Okay, I will.
Ha Ni wants to visit too.

735
00:46:43,810 --> 00:46:48,140
Ha Ni.
Auntie wants to see you lots too.

736
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:50,850
See you this weekend.

737
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:52,450
Sleep well.

738
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:55,880
You too, Beom Soo.

739
00:46:55,950 --> 00:46:57,620
Thanks. Drive safely.

740
00:46:57,620 --> 00:46:59,090
Bye.

741
00:46:59,590 --> 00:47:02,190
Ha Ni. Bye, Auntie.

742
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:05,060
Okay. Bye-bye.

743
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,730
Ha Ni.

744
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:14,000
Are you pleased
that Auntie got you something?

745
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,340
Let's have another bottle
before bedtime.

746
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:20,910
You should be asleep already.

747
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:24,010
Oh Ha Ni. You don't want to sleep?

748
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:27,220
Come on. You need sleep.

749
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,590
Come here.

750
00:47:45,770 --> 00:47:48,170
Let me see Ha Ni one last time.

751
00:47:48,770 --> 00:47:50,170
I won't ask you again.

752
00:47:50,670 --> 00:47:51,710
I promise.

753
00:48:03,350 --> 00:48:05,820
I'm sorry. I didn't know
you had company.

754
00:48:07,290 --> 00:48:08,620
She was on her way out.

755
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:10,660
You don't need to leave.

756
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:13,460
Call me.

757
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:15,500
I'll be waiting.

758
00:48:16,830 --> 00:48:19,070
Why did she come back?

759
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:21,640
What's going on?

760
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:30,910
Free your schedule tomorrow
and don't go to class.

761
00:48:31,350 --> 00:48:33,180
- Why?
- You know why.

762
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:35,620
Gyeol gets discharged tomorrow.

763
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:36,990
Already?

764
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:39,550
Why are you saying "already?"

765
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:41,860
I couldn't wait for the day to come.

766
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:45,190
Why won't you answer?

767
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:47,660
So what if he's getting discharged?

768
00:48:47,730 --> 00:48:49,560
Why can't I go to class?

769
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:51,570
I'm throwing him a surprise party.

770
00:48:52,970 --> 00:48:54,870
Why would he need a surprise party?

771
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,210
What's with the tone?

772
00:48:58,970 --> 00:49:01,210
Aren't you pleased
Gyeol will be back?

773
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:04,480
Why should I be pleased
that he's back?

774
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:12,620
Why are you being
all snarky and twisted?

775
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:18,530
Look into my eyes.

776
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,130
Be honest.

777
00:49:22,130 --> 00:49:25,400
Why are you
suddenly so cold toward Gyeol?

778
00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:29,540
Do you...

779
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:35,180
Do I what?

780
00:49:36,810 --> 00:49:37,910
Do you...

781
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:41,850
have feelings for your professor?

782
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:44,820
What are you talking about?

783
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:46,620
I have a hunch, okay?

784
00:49:47,490 --> 00:49:49,490
Look into my eyes and answer me.

785
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:55,960
Professor Oh Beom Soo, was it?

786
00:49:56,930 --> 00:49:58,400
Do you have feelings for him?

787
00:50:02,370 --> 00:50:04,840
No. You're being silly.

788
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:06,880
Are you sure you don't?

789
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:09,310
Why would you say such nonsense?

790
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:11,150
You're annoying me now.

791
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:13,680
You really don't?

792
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:15,980
I don't.

793
00:50:16,490 --> 00:50:18,620
Why would you even ask such a thing?

794
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:34,070
Oh, gosh. This is gross.
There are moths too.

795
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:35,370
My goodness.

796
00:50:35,370 --> 00:50:38,540
They can't make makgeolli
with rice that should be thrown out.

797
00:50:38,770 --> 00:50:40,240
Don't they fear retribution?

798
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,280
Oh, dear.

799
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,010
My goodness.

800
00:50:47,350 --> 00:50:48,750
Why were you so startled?

801
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,050
I wasn't startled at all.

802
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:52,650
You didn't startle me.

803
00:50:57,830 --> 00:51:00,800
Why the deep sigh?
I hate that sound.

804
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:02,800
You don't need to know.

805
00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:09,140
Tomorrow.

806
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:12,810
I must invite Gyeol to celebrate.

807
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,440
It's a hassle to eat at home.
Let's eat out.

808
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,850
Eating out shows a lack of effort.

809
00:51:17,910 --> 00:51:19,680
A son-in-law is a special guest.

810
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,250
We must show that we care.

811
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:23,520
Do what you want.

812
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:26,390
Let's set the wedding date...

813
00:51:26,390 --> 00:51:28,190
over dinner tomorrow.

814
00:51:29,390 --> 00:51:32,030
If we try to do that
as soon as he gets discharged,

815
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:36,130
won't people think
we're too desperate?

816
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:38,630
We're not in the position
to care about that.

817
00:51:38,870 --> 00:51:40,200
Why not?

818
00:51:43,510 --> 00:51:45,370
It's better if you don't know.

819
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:48,810
I'll take care of it.

820
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:56,220
(Eagle Brewery Unrefined Makgeolli)

821
00:51:56,590 --> 00:51:59,190
(Eagle Brewery)

822
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,030
- Oh, dear.
- My gosh.

823
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:09,870
Be sure to apply a hot pack
before bed.

824
00:52:10,070 --> 00:52:12,570
And see a doctor
first thing tomorrow.

825
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:14,640
Okay.

826
00:52:18,870 --> 00:52:19,980
Thanks.

827
00:52:26,550 --> 00:52:28,480
Goodbye, then.

828
00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:35,460
CEO Ma.

829
00:52:39,430 --> 00:52:40,430
For today...

830
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:44,170
Thank you.

831
00:52:58,350 --> 00:52:59,350
Right.

832
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:36,820
Dad. You hurt your back again?

833
00:53:37,550 --> 00:53:41,290
I guess the previous injury
hadn't healed completely.

834
00:53:41,490 --> 00:53:43,160
It's acting up.

835
00:53:44,190 --> 00:53:45,860
Shouldn't you see a doctor?

836
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:47,600
I will in the morning.

837
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:49,800
I can walk.

838
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,730
Get me a hot pack.

839
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:53,570
- Oh, dear.
- Okay, Dad.

840
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:01,880
Oh, my gosh.

841
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:14,720
Come in.

842
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:24,770
I'll bring some medicinal patches
we got last time.

843
00:54:24,930 --> 00:54:26,330
Okay. Thanks.

844
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:28,470
Bom.

845
00:54:30,470 --> 00:54:32,970
About Lieutenant Oh Kang Soo...

846
00:54:33,910 --> 00:54:35,340
What about him?

847
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:38,810
Why don't you work with him?

848
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:43,390
Ask if he's interested
in starting as an intern.

849
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:45,550
- What?
- He served...

850
00:54:45,550 --> 00:54:48,060
our country as a navy SEAL,

851
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:49,660
so he must be a good leader.

852
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:51,990
He got hurt saving your life,

853
00:54:51,990 --> 00:54:53,660
and that shows responsibility.

854
00:54:54,130 --> 00:54:56,260
He respects his sister-in-law,

855
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:58,700
and that makes me think
he's a good man.

856
00:54:59,070 --> 00:55:00,200
What do you think?

857
00:55:01,270 --> 00:55:03,770
Well... I'll call Lieutenant Oh...

858
00:55:03,810 --> 00:55:06,140
and ask what he thinks.

859
00:55:07,310 --> 00:55:08,310
Sure.

860
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:17,320
Did you just get home?

861
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:20,820
My gosh, were you still up?

862
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:23,160
How could I sleep
when you weren't home?

863
00:55:23,530 --> 00:55:25,590
No way. I'm touched.

864
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:27,860
Good job today.

865
00:55:28,730 --> 00:55:29,800
My goodness.

866
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:32,130
No way.

867
00:55:32,130 --> 00:55:34,440
Being welcomed home
by my two brothers-in-law...

868
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:37,370
washed away all the tiredness.

869
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:42,740
I also stayed up waiting for you.

870
00:55:45,410 --> 00:55:47,250
You and I need to talk.

871
00:56:01,430 --> 00:56:03,430
You'll be the death of me, Mom.

872
00:56:04,970 --> 00:56:07,570
Did your date
with Park Sang Nam go well?

873
00:56:08,170 --> 00:56:10,270
Why would I go on a date
with that man?

874
00:56:10,270 --> 00:56:11,410
I already told you this.

875
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:13,940
You won't find
a better man out there.

876
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:16,640
Do you even know
who he is under his mask?

877
00:56:17,350 --> 00:56:18,380
He's...

878
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:20,580
a scumbag.

879
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,580
What are you talking about?

880
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:23,950
Say it in a way
that I'll understand.

881
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:27,490
Where do I even begin?

882
00:56:28,590 --> 00:56:30,790
What? "Available for lease?"

883
00:56:30,790 --> 00:56:34,500
(Available for lease)

884
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,730
Seon Ah?

885
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,710
Seon Ah!

886
00:56:47,910 --> 00:56:48,910
Wait.

887
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:51,710
Darn it.

888
00:56:51,710 --> 00:56:53,080
(Available for lease,
Doum Real Estate)

889
00:56:58,450 --> 00:56:59,720
Welcome, Mr. Oh.

890
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:02,360
Are you here for a haircut?

891
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:05,430
When did Seon Ah move out?

892
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:08,600
Don't you dare lie
and say you don't know.

893
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:16,040
I own the building,
so of course, I knew.

894
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:18,370
I had to give back her deposit.

895
00:57:18,770 --> 00:57:21,940
How could you not tell me
even though you knew?

896
00:57:22,910 --> 00:57:24,580
Before she left last night,

897
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:29,850
she made me promise not to tell you,

898
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:31,950
so I had no choice.

899
00:57:31,950 --> 00:57:33,350
Whatever.

900
00:57:33,790 --> 00:57:36,160
Tell me where she went.

901
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:37,590
How would I know?

902
00:57:37,830 --> 00:57:38,890
You don't?

903
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:40,630
No, I don't.

904
00:57:41,530 --> 00:57:43,230
She didn't say where she was going.

905
00:57:43,230 --> 00:57:46,430
Then why did she move out
in the middle of the night...

906
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:48,040
without telling me?

907
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:50,000
I don't know the details,

908
00:57:53,610 --> 00:57:55,610
but I'm sure she had
unavoidable circumstances.

909
00:57:55,610 --> 00:57:57,680
What unavoidable circumstances?

910
00:57:57,780 --> 00:57:59,950
Gosh, you startled me.

911
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:02,780
Calm down, Mr. Oh.

912
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:06,150
This is all your fault, Ms. Ji!

913
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:11,060
Why are you accusing me
when I haven't done anything?

914
00:58:11,190 --> 00:58:14,160
You constantly harassed her
and made her life miserable.

915
00:58:14,330 --> 00:58:18,030
She couldn't take it anymore.
That's why she left.

916
00:58:18,030 --> 00:58:19,170
Being angry
doesn't give you the right...

917
00:58:19,170 --> 00:58:20,270
to say whatever comes to mind.

918
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:23,610
I never harassed her...

919
00:58:23,610 --> 00:58:26,070
or made her life miserable.

920
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:28,810
But even if I did,

921
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:31,750
Ms. Kim wouldn't so much as flinch.

922
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:34,080
Then why...

923
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:36,480
did she disappear overnight?

924
00:58:38,150 --> 00:58:39,990
Think that she had her reasons...

925
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:42,120
and move on.

926
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:46,360
Being heartbroken over it
won't bring her back.

927
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:49,800
You've got to be kidding me.

928
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:52,470
Darn it!

929
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:01,010
It'll be rough...

930
00:59:02,210 --> 00:59:03,340
for the time being.

931
00:59:07,450 --> 00:59:08,620
I'm hungry.

932
00:59:09,450 --> 00:59:11,150
Isn't it time for a snack?

933
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:12,520
Tell me about it.

934
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:14,790
- Bring some snacks.
- Hey, Kang Soo.

935
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:17,530
- Have a snack.
- Nice.

936
00:59:17,530 --> 00:59:19,460
I was actually a little hungry.
Great timing.

937
00:59:20,430 --> 00:59:22,130
That smells incredible.

938
00:59:23,230 --> 00:59:25,470
They're good, so dig in.

939
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:29,340
Goodness.

940
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:32,070
Warm, sweet, and delicious.

941
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:35,580
Is Kwang Sook on a delivery run?

942
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:37,950
I volunteered
since she drove a lot yesterday,

943
00:59:37,950 --> 00:59:39,980
but she insisted she was fine.

944
00:59:40,650 --> 00:59:42,480
It's best if she delivers
the products...

945
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,550
to better manage
our customers and partners.

946
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:47,220
Her sociable nature...

947
00:59:47,220 --> 00:59:48,420
makes her popular.

948
00:59:51,790 --> 00:59:52,960
(Chairman Han Dong Seok)

949
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:55,060
Mr. Kim arrived in Sokcho,

950
00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:57,070
and he's now driving back.

951
00:59:57,770 --> 00:59:58,770
I see.

952
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:01,640
How's your back, sir?

953
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:05,710
It's much better than before
thanks to the treatment I received.

954
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:07,580
I'm glad to hear that.

955
01:00:09,410 --> 01:00:10,410
Yes?

956
01:00:12,850 --> 01:00:14,050
CEO Ma.

957
01:00:17,620 --> 01:00:19,920
People were gushing over
Jang-Kwang Makgeolli...

958
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:21,590
at the festival yesterday.

959
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:25,660
I owe it all to you
and Chairman Han.

960
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:27,000
Thank you so much.

961
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:30,160
I'll leave you two to talk, then.

962
01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:37,670
What brings you by?

963
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:41,480
I was on my way out
after meeting the manager and the chef...

964
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:43,010
when I got worried about you.

965
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:45,750
How's your back?

966
01:00:46,450 --> 01:00:49,020
I went to see the doctor,
and now it's better.

967
01:00:49,950 --> 01:00:52,920
I was deeply worried,
so it's a relief to hear that.

968
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:08,570
Is that what you came here to ask?

969
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:10,740
Yes.

970
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:14,040
If you're done,
you should get going.

971
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:15,980
I have a lot to do today.

972
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:17,610
I see.

973
01:01:18,150 --> 01:01:21,520
Look after yourself, then.

974
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:35,700
A Holter monitor?

975
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:38,600
If you press the button
whenever you have the symptoms,

976
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:42,000
an ECG reading will be sent
to an app on your phone.

977
01:01:45,610 --> 01:01:48,440
(EKG, Normal)

978
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:49,440
(History)

979
01:01:56,350 --> 01:01:59,790
I see you require a lot of care.

980
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:12,470
Hold my hand.
It's high, so it's hard to get off.

981
01:02:22,210 --> 01:02:23,340
High-five.

982
01:02:38,060 --> 01:02:39,260
I'm sure of it.

983
01:02:41,230 --> 01:02:43,060
My heart only races faster...

984
01:02:45,270 --> 01:02:46,370
because of Ma Kwang Sook.

985
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:49,970
She's the reason.

986
01:03:32,710 --> 01:03:35,250
(For Eagle Brothers)

987
01:03:35,420 --> 01:03:38,290
Chairman Han and Kwang Sook.
They're dating, aren't they?

988
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:40,660
Are you dating Chairman Han?

989
01:03:40,660 --> 01:03:43,790
One would have to be insane
to say something that preposterous!

990
01:03:43,790 --> 01:03:45,590
Why don't the three of us
live together?

991
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:47,730
What if I don't go to the wedding?

992
01:03:47,730 --> 01:03:49,900
Why the sudden change of heart?

993
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:51,300
It's because of Professor Oh,
isn't it?

994
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:53,530
You're not even denying it.
Does that mean I'm right?

995
01:03:53,670 --> 01:03:55,340
But I would never.

996
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:58,070
There has to be an error.

997
01:03:58,470 --> 01:04:01,840
I guess Chairman Han is cute
in a way.
