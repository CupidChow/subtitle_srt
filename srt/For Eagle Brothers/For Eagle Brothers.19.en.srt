1
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:03,210
Good morning, sir.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:04,680
(Episode 19)

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,980
I had a lot to drink last night.

4
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:09,950
I hope I didn't say anything
out of line.

5
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,290
It's better if you don't know.

6
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:21,960
You spoke out of line to me
due to a misunderstanding,

7
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:25,760
and I was rude to you
because I was drunk.

8
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:30,970
Could we call it even?

9
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,210
I'll be careful from now on.

10
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,490
I'm sorry for being a nuisance.

11
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,820
CEO Ma. You are...

12
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,690
a nuisance.

13
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,800
But...

14
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:06,600
I don't dislike you.

15
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,880
Is that a compliment or an insult?

16
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:15,480
I'll leave that to you
to figure out.

17
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,050
Then, I'll be on my way.

18
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,090
This is why...

19
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:28,560
people can think you're a nuisance.

20
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,400
- Sorry?
- I escorted you home at night...

21
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,170
when you were clearly hammered.

22
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:39,370
Shouldn't you at least offer me
a cup of bitter coffee?

23
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:44,740
You'd be on my case
for offering you a bribe.

24
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,180
How is that a bribe?

25
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,720
I used up gas and wasted my time.

26
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,850
You troubled me immensely.

27
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,890
I was just about
to get some hangover soup.

28
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:02,090
Would you like to join me
for a bowl...

29
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:04,030
of bean sprout soup and rice?

30
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,370
Bean sprout soup and rice?

31
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,270
I never knew a diner
like this existed...

32
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,040
not too far from my hotel.

33
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,210
It's right around the corner...

34
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:21,680
but you've never eaten here?

35
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,150
I never had a reason to eat here.

36
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,150
I see.

37
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:32,960
- Thank you.
- Please enjoy.

38
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:47,440
Don't tell me you've never had
bean sprout soup and rice before.

39
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:50,040
A long time ago.

40
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:52,980
I had some a long time ago.

41
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,620
- Should I crack one in?
- I'll politely decline.

42
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,350
This looks good.

43
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:15,330
Gosh, that's good.

44
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:19,800
People aren't that interested
in others, you know.

45
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,680
I already checked.

46
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,850
The cutlery's clean,
so dig in without concern.

47
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:40,960
That's hot.

48
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,100
Goodness.

49
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,070
I see you require a lot of care.

50
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,150
I'm sure that cooled it down a bit,

51
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,390
so try some.

52
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,120
Thank you.

53
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,000
How is it?

54
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:27,740
It's not terrible.

55
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:31,440
It's better than that.
I bet it's tasty.

56
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,380
It's all right.

57
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:37,950
You've never had something
this delicious before.

58
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,190
What kind of a world do you live in?

59
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,620
The world outside the hotel
is also occupied by people.

60
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,730
Don't stay cooped up in there...

61
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:51,360
and look around from time to time.

62
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,870
Do you want a glimpse
of my schedule?

63
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,770
Maybe you'll like to see
how busy I am.

64
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,340
You only go to certain places.

65
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:03,110
Places your employees
picked for you.

66
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:07,280
Well, I guess.

67
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,650
You only get to live once.

68
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:12,920
Isn't it boring to follow a schedule
that's been laid out for you?

69
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:17,960
At an unfamiliar location
doing unfamiliar things.

70
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,090
It wouldn't be bad to throw yourself
into an unknown world.

71
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,960
So what if you suffer a loss
and make mistakes?

72
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:32,240
Or maybe not. If so, don't mind me.

73
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:50,960
(Specializing in soup and rice)

74
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,440
Thanks to you, I had a great meal.

75
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,680
Even the dessert will be
on me today.

76
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,340
I'm good.

77
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,810
Try it.

78
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,250
It'll be better than you think.

79
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:27,560
How is it?

80
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,130
It's nice and sweet.

81
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,630
See? I told you it'd be all right.

82
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,790
Thank you for this.

83
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,260
I'll take the empty cup.

84
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,090
Thank you.

85
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,120
Are you all right?

86
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,530
Yes, of course.

87
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:40,030
I have plans
and will head back first.

88
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,840
What got into him?

89
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,540
Sir, wait for me!

90
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,150
Why is my heart beating so fast?

91
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,290
Do I have angina?

92
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,630
My gosh.

93
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,600
(Chairman Han Dong Seok)

94
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,600
Yes, sir.

95
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,770
Have Mr. Park come in.

96
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,540
Did you call for me, sir?

97
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:24,910
I need you to book an appointment
with a doctor.

98
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,980
Are you not feeling well?

99
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,550
I think...

100
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,520
my heart's acting up.

101
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,350
Your heart?

102
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,620
It's been beating unusually fast
since yesterday.

103
00:08:38,290 --> 00:08:39,960
I think it's angina...

104
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:43,330
or an early-stage
myocardial infarction.

105
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:46,800
I'll call Director Choi
and schedule an appointment.

106
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:48,300
I need to see him
as soon as possible.

107
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,400
Yes, sir.

108
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,670
Why is my heart suddenly acting up?

109
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,980
It has never done this.

110
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,910
Gosh.

111
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:12,360
Hi.

112
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,460
You're back.

113
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,590
How is the presentation
coming along?

114
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:18,360
I'm doing my best,

115
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,500
but I'm not as sharp
as I used to be.

116
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,930
You have the skills,

117
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,270
so don't push yourself too much
to do well.

118
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,410
Oh, right.

119
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,380
It's a gift.

120
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,550
- What is it?
- Look inside.

121
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,380
(Eagle Brewery,
Vice-CEO Oh Chun Soo)

122
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:43,920
- Kwang Sook.
- I'll be counting on you,

123
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,790
Vice-CEO Oh Chun Soo.

124
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:50,830
This title is too much for me.

125
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,860
I just help you with menial tasks.

126
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:56,930
You have no idea...

127
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,600
how reassuring your presence is.

128
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,310
You're off
to represent Eagle Brewery...

129
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,740
and give a presentation.

130
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:05,080
You need a title like that...

131
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,140
if your words are to have gravitas.

132
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,080
Even so, this is...

133
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,480
If you're going to help,
help eagerly.

134
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,320
Okay. Thank you, Kwang Sook.

135
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,690
To celebrate your appointment
as vice-CEO,

136
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:24,230
how about a random get-together?

137
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,960
A random get-together?

138
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,170
Chun Soo's the vice-CEO?

139
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,500
Yes. It looks like I am.

140
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,840
Kwang Sook made a huge call.

141
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:38,910
Chun Soo. I'm happy for you.

142
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:42,050
You bet. I'll be there on time.

143
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,750
Bye.

144
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,960
You're here early, Professor.

145
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:53,190
- Do you want coffee?
- Sounds good.

146
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:03,730
- Here.
- Thank you.

147
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:09,370
Weren't your parents
worried yesterday?

148
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:10,910
Not at all.

149
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,940
They said it was strange
how much Ha Ni looked like me...

150
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,480
when I was a baby.

151
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:16,650
Really?

152
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:20,520
I'd love it if Ha Ni were to become
as pretty and smart as you.

153
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,120
By the way,

154
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,890
I was too busy to notice yesterday,

155
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,490
but Ha Ni was wearing a dress
and shoes I'd never seen before.

156
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:33,930
Oh, those?

157
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,700
They're hand-me-downs
from my cousin's kid.

158
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,240
They were practically new,

159
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:40,770
so I saved them for Ha Ni.

160
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,010
Why? Do you not like hand-me-downs?

161
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:47,140
Not at all.
They looked as good as new.

162
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:48,480
I'm grateful.

163
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,880
I'm glad you like them.

164
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:55,050
Ha Ni seems to know
how much you like her,

165
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:56,750
and she likes you just as much.

166
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:03,290
(Na Young Eun)

167
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:09,200
(Na Young Eun)

168
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,840
(Na Young Eun)

169
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:31,620
Ha Ni. Did you have fun with Se Ri?

170
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:35,230
It was hard work, wasn't it?

171
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:40,200
How come Beom Soo
is Se Ri's professor?

172
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,600
Why do we
keep getting involved with them?

173
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,010
The mission is complete.

174
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:01,250
This video was taken
by the person we sent in.

175
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:03,490
Good job.

176
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,460
- Zip it.
- What?

177
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:08,890
Of course.

178
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:11,930
Their mouth is zipped.

179
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:17,130
You did great this time.

180
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,270
You were worth your pay.

181
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,770
My gosh, sir.

182
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,410
Thank you.

183
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,810
(CEO Dokgo Tak)

184
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:30,680
Let's make a masterpiece with this.

185
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,760
Mi Sun.

186
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:41,890
What's up?

187
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:53,970
"Eagle Brewery,
Vice-CEO Oh Chun Soo?"

188
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:55,910
I got new business cards.

189
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:58,110
I wanted you
to be the first to see them.

190
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,050
It must be great
to have special skills.

191
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:03,480
You became a vice-CEO
as soon as you joined.

192
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:05,850
Don't tease me.

193
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,850
I'm not teasing you.

194
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,090
Seeing how pleased you are for me...

195
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,120
makes me feel proud.

196
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:18,660
Oh Chun Soo. You're a lucky guy.

197
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,970
- What?
- You have...

198
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:22,600
a sister-in-law who cares about you.

199
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,000
You have brothers
who worry about you,

200
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:28,270
and a friend in me
who cheers for you.

201
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:30,040
We're all by your side.

202
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:32,410
Thanks.

203
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:34,880
I won't let you down.

204
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,180
Let's see.

205
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,620
You will be charged.

206
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,850
(Temporarily closed)

207
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,090
Seon Ah.

208
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:48,590
I left a voice message,
but you won't reply or pick up.

209
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:50,760
What's going on?

210
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,060
Did I upset you?

211
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,070
Are you angry with me?

212
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,700
Were you in an accident
or something?

213
00:14:58,370 --> 00:14:59,370
Gosh.

214
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:02,210
I'm withering away here.

215
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:03,870
Please call me, okay?

216
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:08,880
(Angel Piano)

217
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,550
Goodness.

218
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,220
Welcome.

219
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,430
Can I help you?

220
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,030
Yes.

221
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:27,060
Can you recommend something
that looks pretty but simple?

222
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:29,500
Sure. Is it for yourself?

223
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,800
- Yes.
- Just a moment.

224
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:38,840
These are our current best-sellers.

225
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,150
You're tall and slim,
so you'll look great in this.

226
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:43,580
Try them on.

227
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,880
Can I?

228
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,420
My gosh.

229
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:55,160
You look amazing.

230
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:57,630
Do I?

231
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:01,870
I'll take everything I tried on.

232
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,170
Give me a moment.

233
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,650
(Hankuk University Hospital)

234
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:18,080
The electrocardiogram
and echocardiogram show...

235
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:19,950
that you're perfectly fine.

236
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:23,720
Why did my heart beat so fast, then?

237
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,930
It was loud enough
that I could hear it.

238
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:32,630
When your heart was racing,
did you also feel chest tightness...

239
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:35,330
or break out in a cold sweat?

240
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:37,800
I can't say.

241
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:41,610
I did sweat a bit.

242
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:45,080
You had a full physical
a few months ago,

243
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,210
and you don't have
any internal issues.

244
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:53,680
I've had the same symptoms twice
over the past few days.

245
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,750
I don't think
I should brush it aside.

246
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:59,890
I feel it's serious.

247
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,490
I'll put you on
a Holter monitor, then.

248
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:04,400
A Holter monitor?

249
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:05,830
Yes.

250
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,100
We'll put this small patch
over your heart.

251
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,940
If you press the button
whenever you have the symptoms,

252
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:17,310
an ECG reading will be sent
to an app on your phone.

253
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:19,310
We can analyze that data...

254
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:22,010
to figure out the cause
in more detail.

255
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,750
Let's do that.

256
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,700
To think I have something
like this on me...

257
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,600
How come?

258
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,690
(Eagle Brewery)

259
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:04,120
"Eagle Brewery."

260
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,660
I found the place.

261
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:10,830
(Eagle Brewery)

262
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,100
Is anyone in?

263
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:18,170
Kwang Sook. It's me.

264
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,470
Hey.

265
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:25,180
Goodness. It's you, Ok Bun.

266
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,250
Did I surprise you?

267
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:31,180
What are you doing here?

268
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,680
It's my day off,

269
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:37,050
so I came to give you an update.

270
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,720
I was a bit curious.

271
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,460
Let's go home where we can talk.

272
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:45,460
- It's next door.
- Okay.

273
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,830
So are you saying
she lied to my brother-in-law...

274
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,330
that she was single...

275
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,440
when she was actually married
to someone else?

276
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,170
Yes. My prediction was right.

277
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:00,040
How is this happening?

278
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:02,750
Heung Soo must be devastated.

279
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,950
Heung Soo doesn't know about it.

280
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:08,550
What?

281
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:10,520
I thought he would be too shocked,

282
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,060
so I told Ms. Kim
to leave quietly...

283
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,460
without telling him.

284
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,960
But that's not right.

285
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:21,570
I've given it some thought,
and it's better this way.

286
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:23,670
You know Heung Soo is tenderhearted.

287
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:26,100
He might say, "I forgive you
for what you have done."

288
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:29,310
"Just divorce your husband in prison
and live with me."

289
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:31,110
"I'll put your daughter
on my family register."

290
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:32,880
We can't let him do that.

291
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,550
Of course, it's nonsense.

292
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:39,250
But Heung Soo is crazy
in love with her now,

293
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,720
so he might want to do that.

294
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:46,320
It's better
to take care of things quietly.

295
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:49,930
You have to trust me.

296
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,600
You have a visitor.

297
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,000
Oh, Mom.

298
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:01,810
This is my mom.

299
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,980
Nice to meet you, ma'am.

300
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,480
My name is Ji Ok Bun.

301
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:13,050
I see. Nice to meet you.

302
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:16,850
Well... She's a student...

303
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:19,060
from Heung Soo's Zumba class.

304
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,890
I see. Dance?

305
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:24,260
By the way, what is this?

306
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:25,530
Oh, right.

307
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:28,630
This is what I take.

308
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:32,500
I thought it would be good for you,
so I brought it.

309
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:36,610
You could've come empty-handed.
You don't have to do this.

310
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,910
Since I work standing up all day
at the beauty salon,

311
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:42,080
I feel sore all over.

312
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:44,820
It's good to take care of my health
before it gets worse.

313
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:48,220
You're right.
My wrists are a bit sore these days.

314
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,950
That's great.

315
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,760
(Chondroitin 1200)

316
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,090
Here.

317
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:56,790
Thank you.

318
00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:00,130
You should take good care
of your health now.

319
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:02,100
I'm fine.

320
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:05,200
Come on. Just take it
and you'll see the change.

321
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:07,200
She's right. You work hard...

322
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:10,140
all day stirring the liquor
in the jars.

323
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,140
Drink it.

324
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,210
Thank you.

325
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,590
By the way, your hair...

326
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,090
You have great hair.

327
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:29,560
She's a hair designer.

328
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,560
I see.

329
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:36,700
What is all this?

330
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,270
I am the grand prize winner...

331
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:44,710
of the Seoul Mayor's Cup
K-Beauty Art Contest.

332
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:51,250
Now that I'm here,
I'll give you some hair treatment.

333
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,880
- No.
- It's okay. You don't have to.

334
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,850
I'm just doing this
because I want to.

335
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:00,590
If you keep refusing it,
I'll be upset, Kwang Sook.

336
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:06,230
She seems to have a screw loose.

337
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:10,170
All right then.

338
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:14,070
Which one of you will go first?

339
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,280
My goodness. That feels so good.

340
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:26,880
It relieves my fatigue.
It feels so good.

341
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:32,590
I do have a strong grip.

342
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,960
Mom.

343
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,460
"Mom?"

344
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,130
You're Kwang Sook's mom.

345
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:43,200
That means you're like my mom.

346
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,540
Do you two go way back?

347
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:50,370
This is my second time seeing her.

348
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,610
If Mom and you want,

349
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:59,280
I'll come here
whenever I'm off work.

350
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,450
- What?
- No, it's okay.

351
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:02,720
That makes us uncomfortable.

352
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,590
Why would you feel uncomfortable?

353
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,720
It's not like we're strangers.

354
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:16,300
You're Heung Soo's sister-in-law,
and you're her mom.

355
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,170
So you two mean a lot to me.

356
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,240
Now I get it.

357
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,940
She's Heung Soo's girlfriend.

358
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,740
Not yet.

359
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:30,950
But that's what will happen soon.

360
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:33,550
If you're not his girlfriend,
that's it.

361
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:36,250
What do you mean
it will happen soon?

362
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:40,390
I'm hitting on Heung Soo now.

363
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:43,530
I see. She's hitting on him.

364
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:49,470
I guess
I should make myself clear here.

365
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:54,100
Being nice to me and my mom
doesn't get you anything.

366
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:57,210
What matters is
Heung Soo's feelings.

367
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,750
Of course, I'm aware of that.

368
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:03,910
But Heung Soo...

369
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,420
will eventually come to me.

370
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,820
I see.

371
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:12,660
You and Heung Soo
will make a cute couple.

372
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,390
Maybe you two are meant
to be together.

373
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:17,760
My gosh.

374
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,600
Thank you, Mom!

375
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:24,870
My gosh. Hang on.

376
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:28,470
Mom! You're soaked.

377
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,670
Mom.

378
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:32,410
("All You Need Is a Job Interview")

379
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:09,080
Is there a book you're looking for?

380
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,210
Do you need help?

381
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,020
No, I'm fine.

382
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:16,820
My gosh.

383
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,120
Bom.

384
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:24,090
What are you doing here?

385
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:27,400
I'm here to buy some books.

386
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:29,430
I see.

387
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,390
This is my favorite cafe.

388
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:54,290
It has a cozy atmosphere.
I often come here with my friends.

389
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:57,090
I see. I like the atmosphere.

390
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,560
I didn't expect to run into you
in a bookstore.

391
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,630
You couldn't go to the interview
the other day...

392
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:05,870
because you had to go
to the hospital, right?

393
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:09,670
Right. I still have
a couple of interviews left,

394
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:10,970
so I'm preparing for them.

395
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,040
I'm sure it will go well.

396
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:18,950
What?

397
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,050
Don't come any closer.

398
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:23,390
You're that soldier from back then.

399
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:25,690
What?

400
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,420
Are you two dating?

401
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:30,060
Stop talking nonsense
and go back to your seat.

402
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,090
Forget it.

403
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:34,200
I have something to talk to Bom,
so step aside.

404
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,270
I can't do that.

405
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,930
Who are you to stop me?

406
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:38,940
I am...

407
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,210
her bodyguard
who should protect her.

408
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:50,950
Bodyguard, my foot.

409
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,990
It'll take only five minutes,
so leave us alone!

410
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:56,620
Myeong Guk.

411
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:00,960
What's going on?
You promised you wouldn't do this.

412
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:04,690
Mom, don't worry.

413
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:06,600
I just have something to tell Bom.

414
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:09,000
For your mom's sake,
please leave quietly.

415
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:11,630
If you don't, things will get worse.

416
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,570
Who are you to lecture me?

417
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:16,140
You'll have to go through
an investigation like last time,

418
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,770
and you might actually be arrested
this time.

419
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,910
Think wisely.

420
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,280
Just go home with me.

421
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:27,750
You can say
what you want to say later, okay?

422
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:30,650
Bom doesn't answer my calls...

423
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:33,560
and ignores my texts,
as if I were a stalker.

424
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,630
I just want to explain myself...

425
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:38,560
and have a conversation with her!

426
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,660
If you do it unilaterally
to someone who doesn't want it,

427
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,730
it's not a conversation.

428
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:46,300
He's right.

429
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:49,140
Let's end this here
and go home, Myeong Guk.

430
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:51,840
Myeong Guk, come on. Let's go.

431
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:55,480
Darn you.

432
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,690
- Are you all right?
- I'm okay.

433
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,270
We didn't think
you were married at first.

434
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:18,540
That's right.

435
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:21,300
You have already found
so much success in your career,

436
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:24,510
and you're good-looking too.
All our hearts skipped a beat.

437
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:30,780
Flattery won't get
the essay shortened.

438
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,850
- Come on.
- Come on.

439
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:37,190
By the way,
how did you meet your wife?

440
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:44,630
We both studied
at the same university in the US.

441
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:47,400
- My gosh.
- Lucky her.

442
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,470
Can you share
your love story with us?

443
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:53,270
Does your wife also work
at a university?

444
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:55,570
Not exactly.

445
00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:00,180
Guys, is this some kind of hearing?

446
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:06,280
Professor, you have a meeting soon.

447
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,550
You should get going.

448
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,920
- Right.
- All right.

449
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:10,820
- Girls, go back to your books.
- Goodness.

450
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,460
- We still have some cake left.
- I wasn't done with the cake.

451
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,290
Just finish the drink.

452
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:19,860
That was over too fast.

453
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,470
We'll get going.

454
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:24,230
- We'll get going, Professor.
- See you in class.

455
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,640
- I'll see you around.
- Bye.

456
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,510
Se Ri, are you headed back
to campus?

457
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,410
- Yes, Professor.
- Let's go.

458
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:39,150
The girls must've been curious
about you.

459
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:40,280
I bet you were flustered.

460
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,480
A little.

461
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,650
I appreciate how you ended it.

462
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,420
Is something wrong?

463
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:52,860
I think my new shoes
rubbed my heels raw.

464
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,830
So much for the bandage I put on.

465
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:10,310
Why are we here, Professor?

466
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,250
Your heels seem uncomfortable.

467
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,950
I'll buy you new sneakers,
so choose a pair you like.

468
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,120
It's all right, Professor. I'm fine.

469
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:20,120
You got new clothes
and shoes for Ha Ni.

470
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,560
I was wondering
how I could return the favor,

471
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,160
and the opportunity
presented itself.

472
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:25,660
Get choosing.

473
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,620
Can you choose for me?

474
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:49,790
You should choose
since you'll be wearing them.

475
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:52,120
I'm quite bad at making decisions.

476
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:53,990
That's why they call me Ms. Hamlet.

477
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,390
Ms. Hamlet?

478
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:57,360
Should I get a pair or not?

479
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:00,260
That is the question.

480
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,270
Well, then...

481
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:10,270
- How about this pair?
- This one?

482
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:12,140
- Yes.
- I'm good with it.

483
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,880
Are the shoes comfortable enough?

484
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:17,110
Absolutely.

485
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:19,550
Thank you, Professor.

486
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,720
Wait. Your shoelaces are untied.

487
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:25,920
Just a second.

488
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:03,290
This is the double knot.

489
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:06,730
They won't come undone
as easily this way.

490
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,340
What is she doing over there?

491
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:18,880
Thank you, Professor.

492
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,520
Why is she all giddy like that?

493
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:36,390
What has gotten into her?

494
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,230
- You're home.
- Hey.

495
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:43,500
Should I set dinner for you?

496
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:46,340
In just a moment.
I'd like to catch a breath first.

497
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,700
Of course, sir.

498
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,340
Bom, have a seat over here.

499
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,540
Sure.

500
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,690
I mentioned this briefly once,

501
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:07,460
but I'd like you to manage...

502
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:09,290
the fashion department.

503
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:13,460
We'll be reorganizing
our premium golf clothing line,

504
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,470
and I'd like you to start with that.

505
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,500
You need to work on the project
from the start...

506
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,000
to learn every part
of the process...

507
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,640
from planning and design
to production...

508
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:24,070
and marketing.

509
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:26,510
Bom, what do you say?

510
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:30,150
I still have one semester left
to finish my master's.

511
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:32,320
Exactly. It's your last semester,

512
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,080
which means you could do both.

513
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:39,060
I believe you'll be able to work
at the company...

514
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,720
and finish
your graduation project...

515
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,790
as long as you manage
your time well.

516
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,400
I'll think about it.

517
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:47,860
There isn't much time.

518
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:52,600
Don't think
I'll always be there for you.

519
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,200
What are you talking about?

520
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:57,940
There's my age to consider,

521
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:00,410
and my health
isn't what it used to be.

522
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,810
I'd like you...

523
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:05,980
to learn the ropes at the company
as soon as possible.

524
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,220
Your brother
has never shown interest...

525
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,690
in managing the group.

526
00:34:10,390 --> 00:34:11,920
Are you perhaps ill?

527
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,430
Not really.

528
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:19,100
At my age,
it wouldn't be surprising...

529
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,730
if I suddenly got sick.

530
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:23,600
Some of my old classmates...

531
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,570
have already passed away.

532
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,410
Dad, why would you say that?

533
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,480
When we're together,

534
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,610
people still ask me
if you're my older brother.

535
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:40,150
I know my own health
better than anyone.

536
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:46,920
Goodness.

537
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:09,650
Honey.

538
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:18,920
The batteries in my heart
must be running out.

539
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,660
Once I sort things out...

540
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:27,700
and see to it
that the kids find their path,

541
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:30,100
I'll be able...

542
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:32,870
to rest peacefully by your side.

543
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,360
Yes, ma'am.

544
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:01,830
An international tourism forum
will be held at LX Hotel in Sokcho,

545
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,430
and we got an urgent request
that they'd like to serve...

546
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:05,870
Jang-Kwang Makgeolli
at the dinner party.

547
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:08,140
Could the delivery be made?

548
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:11,040
I'd make that delivery
even if it took place in Jeju.

549
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:13,210
Of course. That can easily be done.

550
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,950
Thank you for this.

551
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:22,550
- Yes!
- Kwang Sook.

552
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,490
Where are you?

553
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:26,390
Right. I'm coming.

554
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,790
I'll get going.

555
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,660
You should stay for dinner.

556
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,230
That's the least I can do
for the work on my hair.

557
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:38,070
Gosh, no.
But I'll take a rain check.

558
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:41,870
All we need to do
is control the temperature.

559
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:42,910
- Right.
- Hey.

560
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:43,910
That's right.

561
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:48,810
Aren't you Mr. Oh's older brother?

562
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:52,550
I remember you from the funeral.

563
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,080
I see.

564
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,350
Do I know her?

565
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:01,620
She's a student
in Heung Soo's Zumba class.

566
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,460
Is that so?

567
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,160
Right.

568
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:10,100
My name is Ji Ok Bun.

569
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,240
You're a hairdresser.

570
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,470
That's right.

571
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:19,340
By the way, you have...

572
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,110
a nicely shaped head.

573
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,750
I see.

574
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,090
Well...

575
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:38,530
I'll come by sometime
and give you a trim.

576
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:41,500
You should know
I specialize in men's haircuts.

577
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,870
I see.

578
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,910
You probably can't help me, then.

579
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,280
I'll get going, then.

580
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:00,180
I'll see her out.

581
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:01,620
Shall we?

582
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:08,390
The shape of my head
may not be symmetrical,

583
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:11,060
but the proportions
aren't that bad. Right?

584
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:16,430
- Get home safely.
- Thanks.

585
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:19,940
Mr. Oh.

586
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,570
Hey, Kwang Sook.

587
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:26,810
What brings you here, Ms. Ji?

588
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,030
Why were you of all people
with my sister-in-law?

589
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:50,270
What business
could you possibly have?

590
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:52,470
It's like I said.

591
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:55,670
I greeted her
at the funeral last year,

592
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:59,080
and we ran into each other
at a barbecue restaurant.

593
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:01,710
I was so happy to see her,
so I offered her a hair treatment.

594
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:05,010
Why would you offer her
such a thing?

595
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:06,520
What could be your angle?

596
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,420
There's no angle.

597
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,720
She seems friendly and kind,

598
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,660
and our conversations
always go smoothly.

599
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:15,320
Do you expect me to believe that?

600
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:19,030
You're doing this
to get somewhere with me.

601
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:22,330
Aren't you doing this
to win points with my family?

602
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:26,140
- I am!
- This is madness.

603
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,570
Stop getting any ideas!

604
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:30,910
You know what?

605
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:33,880
I have no intention
of being in a relationship with you.

606
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:37,410
How many times must I tell you
that you're not my type?

607
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:42,490
Why don't you take a chance
and change your type?

608
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:50,260
This is my last warning.

609
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:52,530
I'll take action...

610
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:54,700
if I catch you around
my sister-in-law again.

611
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,830
I'll call the police!

612
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:07,080
I'll get going, Mi Sun.

613
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:09,180
Did you get into it
with your girlfriend?

614
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:11,810
She's not my girlfriend.

615
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,950
It sure looks that way.

616
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:17,520
Mi Sun, I'm Oh Heung Soo.

617
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,850
I'm an artist for crying out loud.

618
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:22,530
I wouldn't be caught dead
dating a girl like that.

619
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:25,390
You, me, and Chun Soo
should grab a meal sometime.

620
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:29,630
And don't forget to like
and subscribe to Dancing Prince.

621
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:31,870
See you.

622
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,050
But they make a cute couple.

623
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:01,430
(Live brightly, have a broad mind,
and have big hopes.)

624
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,400
Did Ok Bun leave?

625
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:05,470
She did.

626
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:07,570
But she did a fine job on our hair.

627
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,570
We should've
at least offered dinner.

628
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:12,410
Let me be clear.

629
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,740
I don't care if I die a single man.

630
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:17,680
Never will I choose to date Ms. Ji.

631
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:21,880
Why not? You make a cute couple.

632
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:25,450
I don't know
why people keep saying that,

633
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:29,230
but she's far
from the type of woman I like.

634
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:30,360
Let that be a reminder.

635
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:33,100
Kwang Sook, it's me.

636
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,200
That must be Beom Soo.

637
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:37,200
Sure. I'm coming!

638
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:40,870
Goodness.

639
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:44,510
Hello?

640
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:46,440
Are you selling a purse on Gamja?

641
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,840
Yes, I am.

642
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,150
Right now?

643
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:52,250
Okay. Got it.

644
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:54,850
Yes!

645
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,950
- Beom Soo, you're here.
- Hey.

646
00:41:57,450 --> 00:41:59,660
Goodness. Our Ha Ni is here too.

647
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,060
Did you miss your aunt?

648
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:03,930
By the way,

649
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:06,100
- where's the man of the hour?
- Well...

650
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:07,860
- I'm home.
- Right.

651
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:10,470
Goodness, look at you.

652
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:13,340
Being Vice-CEO
helped you clean up nicely.

653
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,110
You look way more polished
than you did a few days ago.

654
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:17,340
You're getting ahead of yourself.

655
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:18,810
Congratulations, Chun Soo.

656
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:19,810
Thanks.

657
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:21,880
It's all thanks to Kwang Sook.

658
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:23,950
Thank you, Kwang Sook.

659
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:28,220
There's no end to your generosity.

660
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:31,650
Stop putting me on a pedestal...

661
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:33,090
and let's eat. I'm hungry.

662
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:34,090
Sure.

663
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:39,260
- Hello, Ms. Gong.
- Hello.

664
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:41,700
It's good to see you all.

665
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:44,270
Goodness.
Our princess is here as well.

666
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:45,300
Say hello.

667
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,370
Where are you off to, Mom?

668
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,510
I have plans.

669
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:52,470
Don't wait for me and dig in.

670
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,350
She seems to be in a good mood.

671
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,450
My gosh.

672
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:08,420
Did Ha Ni fall asleep?

673
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:12,030
Yes, I left the door ajar
so we could hear her if she cries.

674
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:15,430
Now, raise the glass
in front of you.

675
00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:16,430
Sure.

676
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:18,670
- Of course.
- This is for me.

677
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:23,340
This is for Chun Soo's fresh start.

678
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:25,440
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

679
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:37,390
Thank you, Kwang Sook.

680
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:39,220
Thanks, guys.

681
00:43:39,390 --> 00:43:42,060
You had it rough for a long time.

682
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:43,890
From here on out,

683
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:45,290
it'll only be rainbows
and sunshine for you.

684
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:47,600
Vice-CEO Oh Chun Soo.

685
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,800
Nice.

686
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,430
I owe it all to you, Kwang Sook.

687
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:54,070
I haven't been at this long,

688
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:55,200
but from what I've seen,

689
00:43:56,110 --> 00:43:58,070
I can tell...

690
00:43:58,070 --> 00:44:00,510
things were really hard
for you and Jang Soo.

691
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:03,450
I appreciate the sentiment.

692
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:06,650
I'm also ashamed of how I've been.

693
00:44:07,450 --> 00:44:09,750
In the name of putting
my daughter through school,

694
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:12,650
I haven't been
a decent older brother to you.

695
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:14,890
As if that's anything
to apologize about.

696
00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:16,390
You were doing your job
as the man of the house.

697
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:20,330
After quitting my old job,
I lost a lot of money...

698
00:44:20,330 --> 00:44:21,860
trying to start my own business.

699
00:44:22,430 --> 00:44:23,700
But the money I got
from selling the apartment...

700
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,070
was left untouched
for Yeoung Ju's education.

701
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,040
But I gave it all to So Yeon
as alimony.

702
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,040
What?

703
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:33,110
Why would you give her all of it?

704
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,840
It's fine. Money can be
in your hands one moment...

705
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,310
and gone the next.

706
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,950
We may be weak on our own,

707
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:41,620
but together,

708
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:44,050
we'll stand strong and unshaken.

709
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:49,660
I'll take Jang Soo's place.

710
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:54,230
From Five Eagle Brothers
to Five Eagle Siblings.

711
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:57,070
Let's redefine ourselves.

712
00:44:57,830 --> 00:44:59,540
- Five Eagle Siblings?
- Five Eagle Siblings?

713
00:45:00,770 --> 00:45:01,870
I love it.

714
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:05,510
Your words alone are reassuring.

715
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:09,710
Well begun is half done.

716
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:11,650
The first step is most crucial.

717
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:15,180
With this sizzling pork belly fat,

718
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:17,150
let's have...

719
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:19,860
all the sadness, pain,
and resentment...

720
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:21,960
melt away and go down the drain.

721
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:23,130
Okay?

722
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:24,430
- Okay.
- Okay.

723
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:28,230
That being said,
with this lettuce wrap,

724
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:31,300
wash away all the pain...

725
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:33,570
that's weighed on your heart.

726
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:35,840
But...

727
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:37,040
Open up.

728
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:40,940
Sure.

729
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:45,750
Have a chili you love and cheer up.

730
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:46,980
- Forget it.
- Have some.

731
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:48,450
Let it give you fire.

732
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:51,220
Chun Soo.

733
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:55,160
Let's see
what our baby brother made.

734
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:56,390
Have one from your baby brother too.

735
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:58,430
Come on.

736
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,800
- Look at you eat.
- Nice.

737
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,600
This is too much.

738
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,040
Swallow before you talk.

739
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,240
Are you kidding me?

740
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:11,710
I made bean sprout soup.

741
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:14,110
Please enjoy.

742
00:46:14,410 --> 00:46:15,840
Right. I will.

743
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,080
I'll enjoy too.

744
00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:25,790
I see you require a lot of care.

745
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,600
What's wrong, Dad?

746
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:44,240
What?

747
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:47,940
Oh, it's nothing. Let's eat.

748
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,290
I can't eat.

749
00:47:04,890 --> 00:47:08,600
I haven't fully digested
my lunch yet.

750
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:10,600
Do you need any medicine?

751
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:12,430
No, I'm fine. Go on and eat.

752
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:20,240
He has been a bit strange lately.

753
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:23,210
I should take him
to see a doctor tomorrow.

754
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:36,760
Why is my heart racing again?

755
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:44,170
It has to be serious.

756
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:49,970
I'm gravely ill.

757
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:21,040
(Gyeol)

758
00:48:34,450 --> 00:48:35,550
(Gyeol)

759
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:36,550
Goodness.

760
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:43,090
Hello? Hi, Gyeol.

761
00:48:43,830 --> 00:48:45,330
Did you have dinner?

762
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:46,560
Yes, Mother.

763
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:49,770
Is something up with Se Ri?

764
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:51,830
No. Why?

765
00:48:52,370 --> 00:48:54,300
She's ignoring her phone all day.

766
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:56,100
I'm worried something's wrong.

767
00:48:57,140 --> 00:48:58,210
Oh, dear.

768
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,810
She must've left her phone at home.

769
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:04,450
She's clumsy like that.

770
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:08,250
I'll tell her to call you
when she gets home.

771
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:10,590
- Okay.
- Bye. Take care.

772
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:15,320
What's wrong with her?

773
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:19,030
Where's my fruit?

774
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:20,860
I want fruit.

775
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,070
What's up with her?

776
00:49:30,810 --> 00:49:32,570
Dokgo Se Ri. Sit up.

777
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:36,310
Sit up!

778
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:41,480
What do you want?

779
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:42,820
Why did you ignore Gyeol's calls?

780
00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:45,490
He said he called a lot today.

781
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:46,920
Why did you ignore them?

782
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:48,390
Do I have to pick up?

783
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:50,060
What?

784
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:52,160
There can be times
I don't want to talk.

785
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:55,130
Do I have to answer
every one of Gyeol's calls?

786
00:49:56,730 --> 00:49:58,570
Why are you acting out these days?

787
00:49:58,630 --> 00:50:00,440
What are you upset about?

788
00:50:04,010 --> 00:50:06,540
I told him
you left your phone at home.

789
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:08,780
Call him
and pretend you just got back.

790
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:12,980
- Go on. My gosh.
- I don't want to.

791
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:15,650
What are you doing?

792
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:18,820
I don't want to call him.
I just don't want to.

793
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:20,360
Why don't you want to call him?

794
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:29,360
Have you...

795
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:32,370
fallen for someone?

796
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:36,510
I'm asking you a question.

797
00:50:36,810 --> 00:50:38,610
Have you fallen for someone?

798
00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:41,540
What stupid nonsense is that?

799
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:43,080
Darling.

800
00:50:45,110 --> 00:50:47,780
What's this about you
falling for someone?

801
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:50,650
Se Ri. Answer right away.

802
00:50:57,030 --> 00:50:58,490
Don't be silly.

803
00:50:58,490 --> 00:51:02,230
I berated her out of frustration.
Don't take it out on her.

804
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:06,300
I urged her to set a date
for the wedding,

805
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:09,700
and she insisted on waiting
until she finishes her master's.

806
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:11,270
I got frustrated.

807
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:14,280
Why would she be seeing anyone else?

808
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:17,580
Is she right?

809
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:23,850
Say yes.

810
00:51:26,990 --> 00:51:28,990
Yes. She's right.

811
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:45,570
She's sweet and outgoing.

812
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:47,940
I quite like her.

813
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:51,610
Who do you mean?

814
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:54,750
Must you ask? I mean Ok Bun.

815
00:51:55,950 --> 00:51:58,690
Don't even mention her, Kwang Sook.

816
00:51:58,850 --> 00:52:02,160
I have Seon Ah.
Why would you talk about Ok Bun?

817
00:52:02,490 --> 00:52:03,530
Goodness.

818
00:52:04,230 --> 00:52:06,390
I think Ok Bun's a better match...

819
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:09,060
for you than Seon Ah.

820
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:13,540
You're a dreadful judge
of character.

821
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:16,970
You can't compare Seon Ah to Ok Bun.

822
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:18,710
My gosh.

823
00:52:18,810 --> 00:52:21,480
Do you mean the lady
who came to the brewery?

824
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:24,310
Yes.
What was your impression of her?

825
00:52:24,650 --> 00:52:27,550
She was cheerful and spunky.

826
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:29,820
You two would make a great couple.

827
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:32,990
Stay out of it.
You know zero about women.

828
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:36,020
Who's Seon Ah and who's Ok Bun?

829
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:37,760
From what I got so far,

830
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:40,030
Heung Soo likes Seon Ah,

831
00:52:40,130 --> 00:52:41,760
and Ok Bun likes Heung Soo.

832
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:44,170
It's a love triangle?

833
00:52:45,970 --> 00:52:47,100
Yes.

834
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,240
I have a face
that women can't get enough of,

835
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:53,340
and I unwittingly got caught up
in a love triangle.

836
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:56,210
You should watch out.
Don't trust in your good looks.

837
00:52:56,210 --> 00:52:57,680
It can be such a nuisance.

838
00:52:57,850 --> 00:53:00,080
Are you listening? Kang Soo!

839
00:53:03,790 --> 00:53:04,890
Right, Ha Ni?

840
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:08,120
Who do you think
is a better match, Ha Ni?

841
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:10,890
Ha Ni.

842
00:53:10,890 --> 00:53:14,800
Shall we call to see
where Grandma is?

843
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:20,570
(Gaemyeong-dong Community Center)

844
00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:25,510
What do you want?

845
00:53:25,510 --> 00:53:28,740
Where are you and what are you doing
instead of having dinner with us?

846
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:31,580
I have business. I'll be home later.

847
00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:33,750
Are you a Gamja?

848
00:53:34,950 --> 00:53:35,980
Yes.

849
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:37,450
I have to go.

850
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:42,290
I've been waiting for a long time.

851
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:45,730
Sorry. I had to take care
of something urgently.

852
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:47,760
Can I check the item?

853
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,030
Yes, of course.

854
00:53:54,370 --> 00:53:56,200
As I told you over the phone,

855
00:53:56,270 --> 00:53:58,170
I got it as a gift a few days ago.

856
00:53:58,170 --> 00:53:59,540
I didn't use it once.

857
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:03,780
Can we negotiate on the price?

858
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:05,780
No, never.

859
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:07,680
So many people want it.
We're done here.

860
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,020
No, wait.

861
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:11,120
- I'll send you the money now.
- Okay.

862
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:13,320
(Withdrawal: 3,980 dollars)

863
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:14,690
I wired you the money.

864
00:54:16,630 --> 00:54:19,160
Okay.
Thanks for doing business with me.

865
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:20,600
Thank you.

866
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,500
- Thank you.
- Bye.

867
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:35,010
- What are you doing here?
- My goodness.

868
00:54:35,010 --> 00:54:38,210
Darn you. You scared me witless.

869
00:54:38,310 --> 00:54:40,880
Why are you out here, Mother?

870
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:43,220
Are you doing this to annoy me?

871
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:44,590
Are you messing with me?

872
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:45,890
What?

873
00:54:45,890 --> 00:54:47,920
I warned you, didn't I?

874
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:49,390
Not to call me "Mother."

875
00:54:49,390 --> 00:54:52,330
What can I call you other than that?

876
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:55,130
Why am I your mother?
How am I your mother?

877
00:54:55,130 --> 00:54:57,270
I call you "Mother"
because you're my boss's mother.

878
00:54:57,270 --> 00:54:59,700
Are you and Kwang Sook siblings?

879
00:54:59,770 --> 00:55:02,040
I don't have a son like you!

880
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:04,370
What do you want me
to call you, then?

881
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:07,140
Call me "Ms. Ju Sil."

882
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:08,210
What?

883
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:09,880
Why not?

884
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:12,380
Our people have rules
about how to address elders.

885
00:55:13,950 --> 00:55:14,950
That's nonsense.

886
00:55:14,950 --> 00:55:16,380
Why is that nonsense?

887
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:19,650
Foreigners call each other by name
regardless of age.

888
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:21,890
We live here, in Korea.

889
00:55:21,890 --> 00:55:24,430
You're so prim and proper.

890
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:26,490
How about...

891
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:29,530
I call you Ms. Gong, then?

892
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:32,470
Darn you. That sounds so old.

893
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:34,070
"Ms. Gong?"

894
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:36,170
Then, call me "Mrs. Gong."

895
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,510
Mrs...

896
00:55:38,470 --> 00:55:40,240
"Mrs. Gong?"

897
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:44,010
Yes. That sounds nice and elegant.

898
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:46,750
"Mrs. Gong." Say it.

899
00:55:52,090 --> 00:55:53,990
Mrs. Gong!

900
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:56,520
Are you happy now?

901
00:55:57,990 --> 00:56:01,600
Okay, Mr. Go.

902
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:06,200
Visit us often.

903
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:07,440
- See you again soon.
- See you.

904
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:09,970
We'll come by again, Auntie.

905
00:56:09,970 --> 00:56:11,040
Hello.

906
00:56:11,210 --> 00:56:12,240
Hey.

907
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:14,240
You're walking back together?

908
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,280
We met at the bus stop.

909
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:21,280
You still have all your muscles.

910
00:56:21,450 --> 00:56:22,720
You haven't changed.

911
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:24,120
Don't be silly.

912
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:25,490
Did you enjoy the party?

913
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:27,090
Yes, we did.

914
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:29,620
You must be tired. Go on home.

915
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:30,690
Okay, we will.

916
00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:32,130
Goodbye, Ms. Gong.

917
00:56:32,130 --> 00:56:33,860
- Bye, Mr. Go.
- Take care.

918
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:36,770
Bye. Drive safely.

919
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,430
- See you.
- Take care.

920
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:41,040
Bye, sweetie.

921
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:44,140
All right. Let's go in.
You must be tired.

922
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:47,410
- Goodnight.
- All right.

923
00:56:50,310 --> 00:56:53,080
Goodnight, Mrs. Gong.

924
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:57,690
Goodnight, Mr. Go.

925
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:14,440
Yes.

926
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:17,210
(Chairman Han Dong Seok)

927
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:24,410
Hello, Mr. Chairman.
I'm Park Sang Nam.

928
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:27,880
Oh, hello. What are you doing here?
You must be busy.

929
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:30,190
He says
he has something to give you.

930
00:57:30,620 --> 00:57:31,690
Me?

931
00:57:31,690 --> 00:57:33,490
Well, yes.

932
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:38,790
This is a special-edition driver
for VIP customers,

933
00:57:38,790 --> 00:57:41,230
which is not for sale,

934
00:57:41,230 --> 00:57:43,300
and I'd like to give it to you
as a gift.

935
00:57:44,370 --> 00:57:46,200
Why are you giving this to me?

936
00:57:46,370 --> 00:57:50,270
I'd like to thank you for having me
at the VIP lesson last time.

937
00:57:50,870 --> 00:57:54,410
Thanks to you, I got the nickname
"Star Golf Instructor."

938
00:57:55,110 --> 00:57:56,850
And I've got a lot of students.

939
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:01,050
Gosh, but I can't accept
something like this.

940
00:58:01,550 --> 00:58:04,950
Of course, I'm aware
that you have a lot of good stuff,

941
00:58:04,950 --> 00:58:06,920
but this is to show my gratitude.

942
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:09,090
I'd appreciate it
if you could accept it.

943
00:58:10,730 --> 00:58:13,490
I'll just appreciate your gesture.

944
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:15,100
Please don't say that.

945
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:18,570
Then I'll leave it here,
thinking you will accept it.

946
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:20,130
All right then.

947
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,300
Please.

948
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:25,010
Wait.

949
00:58:25,970 --> 00:58:27,040
Hey.

950
00:58:28,110 --> 00:58:30,110
I think he just wants to thank you.

951
00:58:30,110 --> 00:58:33,350
Since it's not for sale,
why don't you just take it?

952
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:36,350
My goodness.

953
00:58:37,050 --> 00:58:39,990
What is his reputation like?

954
00:58:40,590 --> 00:58:42,990
He's talented
and has a good personality,

955
00:58:42,990 --> 00:58:44,890
so he has a good reputation
in the golf world.

956
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:47,800
But...

957
00:58:48,330 --> 00:58:49,330
But?

958
00:58:51,030 --> 00:58:53,570
He's from my hometown,
so I heard a lot about him.

959
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:55,740
He tends to act violently
when he's drunk,

960
00:58:56,670 --> 00:58:58,470
and he had intense jealousy issues
with his wife.

961
00:58:59,370 --> 00:59:00,440
Intense jealousy issues?

962
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:03,340
Yes. So their relationship
wasn't so good,

963
00:59:03,910 --> 00:59:06,210
but his wife died of cancer...

964
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:08,180
a few years ago.

965
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:16,690
It will be a long drive
to get to Sokcho.

966
00:59:19,690 --> 00:59:21,300
Drive safely.

967
00:59:21,330 --> 00:59:22,330
Okay.

968
00:59:22,330 --> 00:59:25,000
(Eagle Brewery)

969
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:28,500
Where are you two going
in those suits?

970
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:30,610
I'm going to the convenience store
headquarters...

971
00:59:30,610 --> 00:59:31,670
to give a presentation.

972
00:59:32,210 --> 00:59:33,880
And Kang Soo is having
a job interview.

973
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:37,380
If it weren't for the interview,
I would've gone instead of you.

974
00:59:37,650 --> 00:59:39,880
Don't worry about me.

975
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:41,820
I just hope
you two will do well today.

976
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:44,690
Good luck!

977
00:59:44,690 --> 00:59:46,450
Good luck!

978
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:48,590
- I got this!
- Wish me luck.

979
00:59:52,890 --> 00:59:54,430
- I'll see you later.
- Okay. See you.

980
01:00:03,370 --> 01:00:05,640
Hello, Mother. This is Sang Nam.

981
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:08,210
Kwang Sook is on her way
to Sokcho now.

982
01:00:08,810 --> 01:00:10,350
Why don't you go there...

983
01:00:10,350 --> 01:00:13,580
and have a great time with her
on a date?

984
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:17,550
Is Kwang Sook going
to LX Hotel in Sokcho...

985
01:00:17,550 --> 01:00:19,490
to deliver makgeolli?

986
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:24,230
Thank you
for the good information, Mother.

987
01:00:24,230 --> 01:00:25,960
I'll go there right away...

988
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:28,200
and have a great time with her.

989
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:29,430
Thank you, Mother.

990
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:43,680
Hey, Yeong Cheol.

991
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:48,020
We should get a rain check
for tonight.

992
01:00:48,820 --> 01:00:51,890
I have to go to Sokcho
to take care of something urgent.

993
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:55,790
I met this woman
on a blind date recently,

994
01:00:56,290 --> 01:00:58,690
but she's playing hard to get.

995
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:01,930
I'm going to finish it off today.

996
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:05,100
With a course meal of raw fish...

997
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:08,470
and some soju with the sound
of the ocean breeze and waves,

998
01:01:08,470 --> 01:01:09,540
I will make...

999
01:01:11,210 --> 01:01:12,470
a hole-in-one today.

1000
01:01:15,510 --> 01:01:16,680
A hole-in-one?

1001
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:20,180
I'll make her mine today
no matter what.

1002
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:21,750
I'm going to end my life...

1003
01:01:22,750 --> 01:01:24,020
as a bachelor today.

1004
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:34,960
What?

1005
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:38,600
How could he be so vulgar?

1007

(Siyang University)

1008
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:06,330
Do you not mind driving yourself?

1009
01:02:06,930 --> 01:02:09,630
I just want to clear my head
and get some fresh air.

1010
01:02:09,630 --> 01:02:11,130
Don't worry about me and go home.

1011
01:02:11,530 --> 01:02:13,570
- Yes, sir. Please drive safely.
- Okay.

1012
01:02:26,110 --> 01:02:27,920
(182 B 4548)

1013
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:31,320
I should get there...

1014
01:02:32,190 --> 01:02:33,960
before Mr. Park.

1015
01:02:34,890 --> 01:02:37,930
I met this woman
on a blind date recently.

1016
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:40,800
I'm going to finish it off today.

1017
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:41,860
I will make...

1018
01:02:43,630 --> 01:02:44,730
a hole-in-one today.

1019
01:03:31,310 --> 01:03:33,810
(For Eagle Brothers)

1020
01:03:33,950 --> 01:03:35,220
What are you trying to do now?

1021
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:36,520
This is school.

1022
01:03:36,850 --> 01:03:38,690
I thought you at least had
that level of sense.

1023
01:03:39,090 --> 01:03:40,690
Seon Ah!

1024
01:03:40,690 --> 01:03:43,260
This is all your fault, Ms. Ji!

1025
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:44,690
When I'm around you,

1026
01:03:44,690 --> 01:03:46,790
I feel like
I'm a pretty good person.

1027
01:03:47,130 --> 01:03:48,960
You're not just
a pretty good person.

1028
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:50,970
You're a great person.

1029
01:03:51,230 --> 01:03:54,300
I'll make sure you get home safely
with a chauffeur service,

1030
01:03:54,370 --> 01:03:55,740
so don't worry and just drink.

1031
01:03:55,740 --> 01:03:56,800
Chairman Han!

1032
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:58,240
You know what?

1033
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:00,780
To be honest,
I was a little touched.

1034
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:03,950
I think you have a bad taste in men.

1035
01:04:04,310 --> 01:04:07,450
Do you have feelings for Kwang Sook
by any chance?
