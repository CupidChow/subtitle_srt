00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:03,510
(Episode 17)

3
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:14,090
Mr. Go.

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,860
Mr. Go? Gosh, Mr. Go.

5
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,360
Mi Sun, what brings you by?

6
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:19,990
Goodness.

7
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,460
Well,

8
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:23,960
Chun Soo...

9
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,000
What about Chun Soo?

10
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,340
He's unconscious
after taking sleeping pills.

11
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:31,770
- What?
- What?

12
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:35,910
I called him to tell him something,

13
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,010
but some guy answered it.

14
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,710
This isn't the time though.

15
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,510
You should hurry over to him.

16
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:44,450
Right. My gosh.

17
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:49,150
Wait.

18
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:51,920
May I come with you?

19
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,290
- Hop in.
- Okay.

20
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,200
Call me once you're at the hospital!

21
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,070
What on earth is this?

22
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,980
May I ask who you are?

23
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:19,350
Oh, right.

24
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,890
I'm Chun Soo's friend.
We went to school together...

25
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,060
from elementary
through to high school.

26
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,860
My name's Mun Mi Sun.

27
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,060
Right.

28
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:31,700
I'm Ma Kwang Sook,

29
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,170
Chun Soo's sister-in-law.

30
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:36,500
I know.

31
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:40,100
I saw you at Jang Soo's funeral.

32
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,340
I see.

33
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,740
I wasn't in my right mind
at the time.

34
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:46,510
I apologize.

35
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,110
Please don't.
Of course, it's understandable.

36
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:54,450
Chun Soo...

37
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:57,190
will be okay, right?

38
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,220
Of course.

39
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,530
Nothing bad will happen.

40
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:05,130
It better not.

41
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:15,010
It was a pleasure to meet you.

42
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:18,080
Once again,
I thank you for helping my daughter.

43
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,380
Thank you for the delicious meal.

44
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,910
- I'll see you at home.
- Sure, Dad.

45
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,780
Until next time, then.

46
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,560
Will you be heading home?

47
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,630
No, I have a job interview at two,

48
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,930
so I'm heading to Gangnam.

49
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,360
And here I was thinking...

50
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,670
I thought...

51
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:45,000
you were a nice suit just for me.

52
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,210
But it was for a job interview.

53
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,740
Sorry?

54
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,540
I'm only joking.

55
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,580
Goodness.

56
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:55,480
Was it a joke?

57
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,280
I'm headed that way too,
so let me drop you off.

58
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,990
It's all right.

59
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:03,860
I'm heading there anyway,
so don't feel burdened.

60
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,320
Come on.

61
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,300
Hey, it's me.

62
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,000
Chun Soo's what?

63
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,370
Which hospital is it?

64
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,140
Hey, Heung Soo.

65
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,240
It's bad, Beom Soo.

66
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:23,540
What is?

67
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:26,080
Chun Soo took sleeping pills
and was taken to the ER.

68
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,050
He did what?

69
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,050
Which hospital is he at?

70
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,520
- Where?
- Hey.

71
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,820
Where is he going in such a hurry?

72
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,970
What about your job interview?

73
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:49,070
I can't make it.
Thank you for the ride.

74
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,880
Kang Soo!

75
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,510
Kwang Sook. Mi Sun.

76
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,950
- You got a call too?
- Yes.

77
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,150
- Let's go.
- Yes.

78
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:12,560
(119 Emergency Medical Services)

79
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,330
- Heung Soo.
- Hey.

80
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:18,700
When did you get here?

81
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,170
I was in a meeting nearby
with my agency people.

82
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,870
Did you see the doctor?

83
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,700
Chun Soo just woke up.

84
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,170
That's good.

85
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,040
- Hey.
- Gosh.

86
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,750
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

87
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,820
Heung Soo. Kwang Sook.

88
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,720
How's Chun Soo?

89
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,920
He just woke up.

90
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:43,920
My gosh...

91
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,020
Look.

92
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,990
Doctor. How is Oh Chun Soo?

93
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,930
He regained consciousness.

94
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:54,500
He's on extra oxygen and an IV drip.

95
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:55,830
He'll go to the general ward...

96
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,300
once his blood pressure and pulse
return to normal.

97
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,010
Will he suffer any aftereffects?

98
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:03,910
He didn't ingest
that many sleeping pills,

99
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:05,240
so you don't have to worry.

100
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:08,580
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

101
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,250
My goodness.

(Chairman Han Dong Seok)

103
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,800
I'm hesitant to say this,

104
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,670
but some industry people told me
that you and your brothers...

105
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,500
are fighting
with your sister-in-law...

106
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,000
over the assets
tied to Eagle Brewery.

107
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,610
We're fighting over assets?
That's nonsense.

108
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:38,180
My sister-in-law
has made a huge sacrifice.

109
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:42,210
Goodness.

110
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,950
(Gyeol)

111
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,320
Hi, Dad.

112
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,020
Can you talk?

113
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:54,830
Yes, I can.

114
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:57,660
Lieutenant Oh Kang Soo
was just here.

115
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,300
We had lunch together.

116
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,330
He's a good-looking young man.

117
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,070
Can he be trusted?

118
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,640
Of course.

119
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:09,540
He graduated from
the Naval Academy with honors,

120
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,940
and he's very responsible.

121
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,780
He had a great reputation
during his service.

122
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:16,110
Oh, I see.

123
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,520
No, there's no special reason.

124
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,090
I hadn't seen
a nice young man in a while,

125
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,160
and I wanted to be sure.

126
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,560
I'll let you get back to work.

127
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:36,270
Everything Dokgo Tak told me...

128
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,670
was a groundless rumor.

129
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:41,710
Oh, dear.

130
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:44,780
I shouldn't have believed
what I'd heard.

131
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,380
Oh, well.

132
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,330
Goodness, it's Bom.

133
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,180
They looked good together.

134
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,110
Why didn't I think of that?

135
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,280
Oh, gosh.

136
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,690
Hi, Se Ri.

137
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,090
Where are you, Mom?

138
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,990
I'm at home.

139
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,960
Why are you at home?

140
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,660
You said you'd pick me up.

141
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:39,330
Oh, I forgot.

142
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,100
Sorry. I'll be right there.

143
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:43,070
Forget it. I'll take a taxi.

144
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:47,040
I got distracted.

145
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:49,340
I'm sorry, darling puppy.

146
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,870
I slept so well.

147
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,410
Why are you all staring at me?

148
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:28,850
I see.

149
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:32,620
I took some sleeping pills
because I couldn't sleep.

150
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,420
I was drunk,

151
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,550
and I must've taken too many.

152
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,790
I swear.

153
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,890
That's it, Kwang Sook.

154
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,360
I know.

155
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,600
I believe you, Chun Soo.

156
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,070
It's true, Heung Soo.

157
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,470
Okay. Let's say it is.

158
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:56,310
It really is the truth.
I'm not just saying that.

159
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:59,080
You can't take sleeping pills
when you're drunk.

160
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,910
It could've gone really bad.

161
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:03,010
I hadn't slept in days.

162
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:06,480
We should've checked on you. Sorry.

163
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,450
Why would you apologize?

164
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,320
I'm the one who should apologize.

165
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,290
I do nothing but cause concern.

166
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:15,930
Why am I like this?

167
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:17,800
It's fine.

168
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,030
Stop being
the smart, good Oh Chun Soo...

169
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:22,030
and just be a troublemaker for once.

170
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,240
- A troublemaker?
- Yes.

171
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:29,740
What is he talking about?

172
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,310
Stop trying to be so good and nice.

173
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:40,650
Mi Sun. Chun Soo's awake.
You can go in and see him.

174
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:42,790
No, thanks.

175
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,460
Now that I know he's okay,
I'll go now.

176
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,560
I closed my store for too long.

177
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,160
Thank you.

178
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,470
If it hadn't been for you,

179
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:57,400
Chun Soo...

180
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:00,600
might still be alone
and unconscious.

181
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,940
It would've been a mistake.

182
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,010
Chun Soo...

183
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,650
is not that irresponsible...

184
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,050
or weak.

185
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,290
I see my brother-in-law
has a great friend.

186
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:25,800
Bye, then.

187
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,150
Let's clink our cups.

188
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,610
Cheers.

189
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:50,090
I should've picked you up.

190
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:51,590
I'm sorry, Mother.

191
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,220
Don't say that.

192
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:56,490
Kwang Sook would throw a fit
if she knew we were meeting.

193
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:02,470
The reason I asked
to see you today is...

194
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,100
What's this?

195
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,570
So that you can see for yourself...

196
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:10,640
what kind of man I am,

197
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,540
I printed out my personal records.

198
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,640
Goodness.

199
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,110
You didn't have to.

200
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,120
My injury...

201
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,950
stopped me from reaching my goal
as a pro golfer,

202
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:24,120
but I started competing quite young,

203
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,060
and I taught many people,
and that's how I made my wealth.

204
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:31,460
The apartment I live in...

205
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:34,530
and the golf supply store
are in my name.

206
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:36,900
I even bought some land...

207
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,800
to build a driving range.

208
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,670
(Deed Registration Certificate)

209
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:48,110
How did you make so much
at your young age?

210
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,780
That's so impressive.

211
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,750
It's the bare minimum...

212
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:55,450
so I can spoil my woman.

213
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,250
You're a real macho man.

214
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,720
That's awesome.

215
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:01,030
And also...

216
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,360
What's this?

217
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:08,330
I hope you like it.

218
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:17,040
Goodness. It's a designer handbag.

219
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,450
Why would you give me this?

220
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:26,120
It's a token
of my appreciation, Mother.

221
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,420
I can't accept that.

222
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,750
Your thought is more than enough.
Thank you.

223
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,430
You're Kwang Sook's mother,

224
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:37,030
and that makes you
more than worthy of it.

225
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,230
Please accept it
or I'd feel embarrassed.

226
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,870
Kwang Sook would lose her mind
if she were to know.

227
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,340
Take it and don't say a word to her.

228
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:52,110
I wanted to give you something
regardless of her.

229
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,180
Even so...

230
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,710
This isn't right.

231
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,950
I'd appreciate your help, Mother.

232
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:11,360
Yes. I should help you.

233
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,100
Of course, I will.

234
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:18,570
We really get each other.

235
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,340
But Kwang Sook
wouldn't open up to me.

236
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,680
Don't be discouraged.

237
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,450
You should keep trying
without giving up.

238
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,920
A woman is supposed to cave in...

239
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,780
when a man is sincere.

240
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,950
I've given it some thought.

241
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,860
As long as Kwang Sook
runs the brewery,

242
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:44,200
I don't think she'll get remarried.

243
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,660
What do you mean?

244
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,700
Since she took over
her late husband's work,

245
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,870
everyone she works with
must be connected to him.

246
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,640
- Right.
- Also,

247
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,470
there will be traces...

248
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:59,010
of her husband
everywhere in the brewery.

249
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,010
In such a situation,

250
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,180
she wouldn't want
to date another man.

251
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,520
That makes sense.

252
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,790
Can't you sell the brewery...

253
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,660
or let someone else take it over?

254
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,960
I mean,
she has four brothers-in-law.

255
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:20,230
Isn't there anyone
who can take care of it?

256
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,980
I had a hard time
getting this photo.

257
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:41,620
My goodness. It's a wedding photo.

258
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:45,160
Apparently, Ms. Kim met her husband
when she was a senior in college.

259
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,030
When her father got involved
in a medical accident,

260
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,660
the hospital closed down,

261
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,230
and her family went broke.

262
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,630
So they even borrowed money
from loan sharks.

263
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,970
Back then,

264
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:59,700
her husband, who was a gang enforcer
and a loan shark,

265
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,870
fell in love
with Ms. Kim at first sight...

266
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:04,940
and went after her.
And one thing led to another...

267
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,910
My goodness. She even got pregnant.

268
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:10,210
My goodness.

269
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,240
She's smiling from ear to ear.

270
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,850
(Ms. Kim)

271
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,200
I was in the middle of a lesson.

272
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,400
What's the matter now?

273
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,330
Luckily,

274
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,200
I met a detective
with a lot of experience,

275
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,870
so things worked out easily.

276
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:43,010
You can tear them up.

277
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,910
I have the original photos
somewhere else.

278
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,550
Are you trying to threaten me
with some photos like this?

279
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,820
I'm not threatening you.

280
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:55,720
If you just disappear quietly,

281
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,020
I'll pretend nothing happened.

282
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:00,990
What?

283
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,360
Once Mr. Oh finds out
about your past,

284
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,600
he will get hurt and suffer a lot.

285
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:08,970
I can't stand seeing all that.

286
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:11,600
I'll keep my mouth shut.

287
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,870
So leave this neighborhood quietly.

288
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,140
Why would I have to leave?

289
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,010
I didn't do anything wrong!

290
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:23,180
When you didn't do anything wrong,

291
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:25,980
why did you pretend to be single?

292
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:30,550
When you were so proud
and had nothing to fear,

293
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,290
why didn't you put your daughter
on your family register?

294
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:35,860
Why didn't you let her call you Mom
in front of others?

295
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,060
Stop acting so tough...

296
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,500
and just do as I say
when I'm being nice.

297
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,240
I'll keep your secret.

298
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,910
So stop messing with him
and leave this neighborhood.

299
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,350
I'll give you 24 hours.

300
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,250
Think carefully
and give me your answer...

301
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,250
by this time tomorrow.

302
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,650
He wouldn't wake up.

303
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:33,550
He took the pills while drunk,

304
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,750
but I don't think
he was trying to commit suicide.

305
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,960
That's what I think,

306
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,130
but we can't be sure
that it won't happen again.

307
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,300
You're right.
We can't leave him alone.

308
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,370
When he gets discharged,
I'll take him to my place.

309
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,740
You're busy taking care of Ha Ni.

310
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,070
How would you take care of him?

311
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,140
I'll take him to my place.

312
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:56,010
He can stay in the living room,

313
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,270
and I'll sleep in the small room.

314
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,910
I thought about it.

315
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:01,510
I will get a small apartment
and live there with Chun Soo.

316
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:03,280
- You?
- You?

317
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,650
I want to do that
if Kwang Sook doesn't mind.

318
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:08,820
This isn't something
we can decide right now.

319
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,760
Let's think about it a little more.

320
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,400
I should go and pick Ha Ni up now.

321
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,600
I should get going.

322
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:27,170
You guys can leave now.

323
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:28,440
I'll stay here.

324
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:30,640
All right then.
I'll leave you to it.

325
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,340
Let's go.

326
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,710
Let's go.

327
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,250
See you.

328
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:42,150
Where's Beom Soo?

329
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,690
He left.

330
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:46,090
Let's go. I'll drive you home.

331
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,290
No. You go ahead.

332
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,600
Do you have plans?

333
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,070
I was going to keep my temper
in check and live quietly,

334
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:59,300
but I'm so upset
that I can't let this slide.

335
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:02,070
My pride doesn't allow it.

336
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,340
What are you talking about?

337
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,380
I'll bring So Yeon to Chun Soo...

338
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,910
and make her beg for forgiveness
on her knees.

339
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,820
I'll see you later.

340
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,230
What if he ends up
causing some trouble?

341
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:37,910
I get that you're angry and upset,
Heung Soo.

342
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,640
But you have to act rationally.

343
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:43,680
You can't speak rudely...

344
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,880
or resort to violence.

345
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,850
As long as she sincerely
apologizes to Chun Soo,

346
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:50,250
I won't need to raise my voice.

347
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,530
There she is.

348
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,600
How are you feeling?

349
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:11,040
After sending his daughter and wife
to the US,

350
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,980
Chun Soo supported his family
until he went broke.

351
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:16,710
How do you feel
about ruining his life like this?

352
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:18,580
Did I get him drunk?

353
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,680
Did I make him take the pills?

354
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:24,050
Why are you blaming me for it?

355
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,090
He's a nerd
who only cares about his family.

356
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:30,990
Do you think he took the pills
while drunk for no reason?

357
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:34,060
You suddenly showed up
and asked for a divorce and money.

358
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,900
The whole thing happened
because you roasted him.

359
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,570
If you had a conscience,

360
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:41,300
shouldn't you at least pretend
to be sorry?

361
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,540
What do I have to be sorry about?

362
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:46,740
I also went through a lot
raising Yeoung Ju.

363
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,480
You're not supposed to say that...

364
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,150
when you cheated on Chun Soo
with the money he sent you.

365
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:54,250
I spent all the money he sent me
on Yeoung Ju.

366
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,390
What? I cheated on him?

367
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:59,360
I did it with the money I earned,
so I'm not ashamed.

368
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:00,660
Are you happy now?

369
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,960
You shoved my brother around
the whole time.

370
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,530
The moment he went broke,
you went crawling to another guy.

371
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,140
And you're saying
you're not ashamed?

372
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,700
Crawling to another guy?

373
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:16,370
Watch your mouth!

374
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,710
Did I say something
that wasn't true?

375
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:20,440
Your brother and I
were never compatible to begin with.

376
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:22,880
That's why I took Yeoung Ju abroad.

377
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,380
Is that so?
Let's lay it all out there.

378
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:27,620
We were never fond of you anyway.

379
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,850
You showed up out of nowhere
pregnant with his child,

380
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:31,620
so we had no choice
but to accept you.

381
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:36,360
And that's exactly why
I finally want to end it!

382
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,960
Getting a divorce is one thing!

383
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:41,300
But for now, go to the hospital
and apologize to Chun Soo.

384
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,300
Apologize?

385
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:43,830
If you're a human being...

386
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,540
If you have even the slightest bit
of conscience,

387
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,970
you'll apologize.

388
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:49,910
I should be the one
getting an apology.

389
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:53,910
He could've dealt with this matter
reasonably and rationally,

390
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:57,150
but he got emotional
and made me look like the bad guy.

391
00:22:58,050 --> 00:22:59,050
What the...

392
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:03,520
I wasn't going to say anything,
but you're a piece of work.

393
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,520
I don't care
if you're going to divorce him.

394
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,820
Your husband was unconscious
and taken to the ER.

395
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:10,430
Isn't it common sense
to ask how he's doing first?

396
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,060
As if I don't know him.

397
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,730
He's so fainthearted.

398
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:15,130
He probably couldn't even take
that many pills.

399
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,600
Do you even hear yourself?

400
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,540
You sound like
you actually want Chun Soo...

401
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,870
to take a boatload of pills
and kill himself!

402
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:26,440
Darn. You're the worst!

403
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:33,880
Come with me to the hospital.

404
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,690
Have you lost your mind, woman?

405
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:37,090
Let go!

406
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:39,190
Woman?

407
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:41,790
As if I should be polite
given the state we're in.

408
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:44,760
Not only did you coax
my innocent brothers-in-law...

409
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,460
to take the brewery for yourself,

410
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,060
but you stick your nose
in everything all the time.

411
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,100
You're disgusting.

412
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:50,730
I'm disgusting?

413
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:52,840
Is that what you said?

414
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,210
You're close to throwing a punch.

415
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:02,250
Come with me to see Chun Soo.

416
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,850
No, I'm not going.

417
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:07,180
We're going to the hospital.

418
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,790
- But...
- Darn it, woman.

419
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:10,990
Let go of me!

420
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,870
Are you all right?

421
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,340
So Yeon...

422
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,110
- Are you all right?
- Are you all right?

423
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:36,150
Move!

424
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,610
Go away!

425
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,620
This is assault!

426
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:46,090
Assault?

427
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:47,790
You fell all by yourself.

428
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,970
Hello? Is this the police?

429
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,440
- The police?
- The police?

430
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:07,640
Where are we going?

431
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:10,550
We need your statement
at the station.

432
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:14,020
Why do you need my statement
when I did nothing wrong?

433
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:15,690
Pull over.

434
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,850
Let me out!

435
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,620
Refusing to confirm your identity
and failing to come with us...

436
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,890
puts us in a difficult position.

437
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:25,430
I'm being wrongfully accused.
I didn't assault anyone!

438
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:28,500
That will come to light
once we investigate, so don't worry.

439
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,670
Calmly cooperate with us, ma'am.

440
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,900
Why am I the only one being taken?

441
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,270
You should've taken her too!

442
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,810
The alleged victim
will be assessed by a doctor...

443
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:38,510
and meet us at the station.

444
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,340
Assessed by a doctor?

445
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,120
Darn, this is crazy.

446
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:02,900
I don't care how angry you are.
You're crossing the line, So Yeon.

447
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:06,400
You and that woman
crossed the line first.

448
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:08,740
Don't you see the cut
on my forehead?

449
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:10,710
It'll take three weeks to heal.

450
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:14,380
So? You'll actually press charges?

451
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:18,280
One should be punished
for assaulting another.

452
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,550
An assault?

453
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,180
I witnessed it all,

454
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,390
and you lost balance
all on your own.

455
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:27,960
That's for the police to determine.

456
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:31,560
My gosh. This is crazy.

457
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,330
You've got to be kidding me.
So Yeon!

458
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,470
The cut on my forehead
will take three weeks to heal.

459
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:39,840
If I had gotten an MRI,

460
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,600
it would've shown
that I was concussed.

461
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:46,510
Three weeks to heal
for a minor tumble?

462
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,910
Are you accusing me of lying?

463
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:53,050
Calm down, ladies.

464
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,490
Don't blow this out of proportion
among family members.

465
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:57,690
I suggest you apologize,

466
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,960
and that you take the settlement.

467
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:04,590
Why should I apologize
when I did nothing wrong?

468
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,200
Aren't you going to settle?

469
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,500
No. Not until she apologizes.

470
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,840
Aren't your husbands brothers?

471
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,970
Proceed according to the law.

472
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:14,570
But you have a flight to catch.

473
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:16,610
If you press charges,
it'll only get complicated.

474
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:19,480
Whatever. I won't ever settle,

475
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,980
so punish her according to the law.

476
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:25,020
Sure.

477
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,590
Please proceed according to the law.

478
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,460
If I did anything wrong,

479
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:37,760
I will gladly do my time in prison.

480
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,500
No one goes to prison for this,

481
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:44,600
so keep quiet.

482
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:52,040
Are you sure
you're not going to settle?

483
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,540
Don't cry about it later, then.

484
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,950
(Eagle Brewery)

485
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,790
About Lieutenant Oh...

486
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,730
I found him somewhat familiar
when I first met him.

487
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,360
It hit me earlier...

488
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:15,430
that he's a lot like you
back when you were young.

489
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:16,730
Really?

490
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:19,040
I can't say I saw that myself.

491
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,470
You're a lot alike.

492
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,210
You're slightly
better looking though.

493
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,680
But Lieutenant Oh
is slightly taller.

494
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:31,710
Yes, only slightly.

495
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,350
I'm worried about him
missing his job interview.

496
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:38,490
His job interview?

497
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:42,530
He had a job interview lined up
after the lunch,

498
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:46,860
but his second brother
was rushed to the ER,

499
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:47,900
so he had to go to the hospital.

500
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,600
He couldn't make it
to his job interview.

501
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Oh, dear.

502
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:56,870
If he's Lieutenant Oh's brother,
he's CEO Ma's brother-in-law.

503
00:28:57,370 --> 00:28:58,370
Is he all right?

504
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:01,280
I texted him earlier,
and he regained consciousness.

505
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,280
I'm glad to hear that.

506
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:08,250
Mugwort is in season,
so I cooked fish soup with it, sir.

507
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:11,860
Fish soup with mugwort?
That sounds good.

508
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,490
I'll enjoy that.

509
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,460
Would you like a drink with that?

510
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:19,230
Why don't I keep it light
with makgeolli?

511
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:20,800
Do we have any Jang-Kwang Makgeolli
in the fridge?

512
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:24,770
Yes, but you said you wouldn't be
having any for a while.

513
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:26,870
I changed my mind.

514
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:34,940
It's about Chairman Han.

515
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:36,950
What about him?

516
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:39,880
Most of my employees already know
we'll be family through marriage.

517
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,590
How could he humiliate me
by refusing to choose our liquor?

518
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:44,920
How dare he make a fool out of me?

519
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,360
I see our liquor didn't score well.

520
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,430
The wife of the late Oh Jang Soo.

521
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,030
That woman is a piece of work.

522
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:55,870
She must have the executives
wrapped tightly around her finger...

523
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:57,070
because none of them will budge.

524
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,070
Goodness.

525
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:01,370
Silla Brewery is a major company...

526
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:03,270
while Eagle Brewery
is a corner shop.

527
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:06,510
They're not our competition,
so don't be bothered by this.

528
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:08,440
How can I not be bothered...

529
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,050
when I was robbed blind?

530
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,450
You're the one
who tried to rob them.

531
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:16,150
It is Eagle Brewery
who has been supplying to LX Hotel.

532
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,590
Unbelievable.

533
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:22,590
Rather than comforting your husband
when he's upset,

534
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:25,030
you're more keen
on pointing out his error.

535
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,330
Who taught you to be this crass?

536
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:29,030
I wasn't pointing out your error.

537
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:32,270
I was trying to comfort you
to make you feel better.

538
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:33,270
Whatever!

539
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:35,840
I don't want to talk to you,
so leave.

540
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,910
All right, fine.
I will after hanging this up.

541
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:40,110
- Hands off my jacket!
- My gosh!

542
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,710
Honey, please!

543
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:42,850
Get out!

544
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:45,480
Darn.

545
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:57,830
When will he grow out
of that temper tantrum?

546
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,400
Why is Dad so angry?

547
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:06,270
His plan to supply makgeolli
to LX Hotel...

548
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:07,400
didn't pan out.

549
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:09,610
I can't believe him.

550
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:12,840
He shouldn't take that out on you.

551
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:14,910
We should understand
where he's coming from.

552
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:16,450
He started this project...

553
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:18,150
because he trusted
your future father-in-law...

554
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:19,520
but was rejected.

555
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,950
Can you please
stop calling Mr. Han that?

556
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:24,850
We'll be settling on a date
once Gyeol is discharged.

557
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:26,660
That's what Dad wants.

558
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:28,090
But not you?

559
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:30,390
Not me.

560
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,230
What are you saying?

561
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,770
Are you not going to marry Gyeol?

562
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,570
I haven't decided to marry him,

563
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:40,400
but I haven't decided
not to, either.

564
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,840
What do you mean by that?

565
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,410
How many times must I repeat myself?

566
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:45,810
Gyeol's like a brother to me,

567
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,810
so how can I marry my brother?

568
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,120
What on earth?

569
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,250
What has gotten into her?

570
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:10,130
Goodness.

571
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,470
Ha Ni, you're the sweetest.

572
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,740
You knew Daddy was busy
and played so well on your own.

573
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:18,940
Here. Look at this rubber glove.

574
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:20,680
Just a second.

575
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,150
Hey, Heung Soo.

576
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,420
It's bad, Beom Soo.

577
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:30,990
What now?

578
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:34,060
Kwang Sook is
in a police holding cell.

579
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:36,030
What are you talking about?

580
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:38,290
Why was she put in a holding cell?

581
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,200
Ms. Ma Kwang Sook.

582
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:44,330
You have a visitor.
Head to the visitor's room.

583
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:49,570
Sure. I'm coming.

584
00:32:58,210 --> 00:32:59,520
Guys, you're here.

585
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:01,850
Goodness me.

586
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:05,020
Ha Ni, are you here
to see your aunt?

587
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:07,190
Goodness me.

588
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:09,030
It's good to see you.

589
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,430
Kwang Sook.

590
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:12,100
Are you all right?

591
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:14,230
Of course.

592
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:16,470
They say if you've already fallen,
it's a good time to rest for a bit.

593
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:19,140
I haven't had a chance to rest
while running the brewery,

594
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,470
so I used this time to meditate...

595
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:22,910
and practice yoga.

596
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,070
It's nice.

597
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:28,010
That's what you say,
but I know it's stifling in there.

598
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:31,050
We'll settle with So Yeon
and get you out in no time,

599
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,180
so hang in there.

600
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:34,920
There's no need to beg
for a settlement.

601
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,090
Don't be such a chicken
when I did nothing wrong.

602
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:41,060
Kwang Sook,
you're a formidable woman.

603
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:43,390
She thinks I'll cower
if she presses charges...

604
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:44,990
but only in her dreams.

605
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:47,600
She plucked a hair
from a sleeping lion's nose...

606
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,070
and tossed a stone into calm water.

607
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,340
I'll also press charges...

608
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:55,270
for making false accusations.

609
00:33:57,570 --> 00:34:00,810
I'm honestly moved
by your guts and spirit.

610
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,820
You made Ha Ni cry.

611
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:09,350
- Goodness, Ha Ni.
- It's all right.

612
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:11,150
Did that startle you? It's nothing.

613
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:13,090
- Ha Ni, we're sorry.
- It's okay.

614
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:17,530
Kwang Sook,
I called a lawyer friend.

615
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:18,690
He will be here soon.

616
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:21,260
He's good at his job
and will settle this in no time.

617
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:23,170
Thanks.

618
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:26,140
My brothers-in-law are the best.

619
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:32,940
Did she meet with her lawyer?

620
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,410
Unless So Yeon settles,

621
00:34:35,410 --> 00:34:37,450
will Kwang Sook have to stay
in a holding cell?

622
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:40,450
What is that all about?

623
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:47,860
Why is Kwang Sook in a holding cell?

624
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:50,160
What do you mean by that?

625
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:53,660
I'm asking you!

626
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:10,610
Are you out of your mind?

627
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:13,080
Why are you yelling at me?

628
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:15,020
I'm the victim here.

629
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,120
Should I show you my doctor's note?

630
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,290
Cut the nonsense...

631
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:19,190
and go and have Kwang Sook released
right now.

632
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,520
I knew it.

633
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,060
You don't even want to hear
my side of the story...

634
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,590
and are only taking her side.

635
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:24,630
Go to the police station
this second.

636
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:26,700
- No!
- What?

637
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,560
You won't give me what I want,

638
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,770
so why should I give in
to your request?

639
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:32,100
What you want?

640
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,300
What's that?

641
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:36,770
A divorce?

642
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,210
Fine.

643
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,780
All right.

644
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:46,650
I'll give you that.

645
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,020
Here.

646
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:54,390
(Daehan Bank)

647
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,590
What's this?

648
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:58,090
There's probably more
than you expected.

649
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,500
I'll give it to you as alimony,

650
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:03,200
so go to the police station
and drop the complaint.

651
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,340
I'll go get my purse.

652
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:17,380
How are you feeling?

653
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,720
Is Heung Soo right?

654
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:23,990
Was I the reason
you took those pills?

655
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,890
You are not important
enough to me...

656
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:32,830
to make me want
to take pills and die.

657
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,290
Kwang Sook.

658
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,890
Ma Kwang Sook.

659
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:05,600
You're here.

660
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,260
Where's CEO Ma?

661
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:11,430
Is she out on a delivery run?

662
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,170
She's at the police station.

663
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:15,970
I see. To make a delivery?

664
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:17,670
Not exactly.

665
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:20,080
She's being held...

666
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,650
in a holding cell.

667
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:25,180
What? Why is she in a holding cell?

668
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:27,220
I don't know the details,

669
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:31,120
but she got into a fight
with Chun Soo's wife.

670
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:34,720
My gosh. That brat...

671
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:46,600
Stay with me!

672
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,220
Ms. Ma Kwang Sook.

673
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:01,950
Come on out.

674
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:05,190
(Eagle Brewery)

675
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:09,230
Do I have a visitor?

676
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:10,630
You have been released.

677
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:12,430
Please get ready to leave.

678
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,130
I've been released?

679
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:19,670
(Strong Police, Safe Korea)

680
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:22,240
(Civil Affairs Office)

681
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:24,910
It didn't seem like
she was going to back down,

682
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:26,610
so why the sudden change of heart?

683
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:30,410
Don't.

684
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,150
What is it?

685
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:40,460
Chun Soo was adamant
about not giving her a divorce,

686
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:43,760
but he agreed
to sign the divorce papers...

687
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,230
in exchange
for her dropping the charges.

688
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,960
Oh, no. I ruined it.

689
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,400
No, this isn't on you.

690
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:51,670
This divorce was inevitable.

691
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,600
Beom Soo's right.

692
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:56,040
The divorce had to happen
even if it wasn't for this.

693
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,570
Being stubborn
wasn't going to help him.

694
00:38:57,610 --> 00:39:00,040
Oh, no.

695
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:04,150
Your mother's here.

696
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:06,480
Hello.

697
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:10,650
You!

698
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:12,050
You!

699
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:13,920
You!

700
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,290
You now do this of all things?

701
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:19,430
Are you a thug or a gangster?

702
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:22,330
- No, you can't do this.
- Ms. Gong, please.

703
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:24,030
Out of all things,

704
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:26,240
how could you assault someone
and land in prison?

705
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,770
I never assaulted anyone!

706
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:30,810
Besides, it was a holding cell
and not a prison cell.

707
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:32,680
Shut that mouth of yours!

708
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,610
I witnessed it, Ms. Gong.

709
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:37,880
Chun Soo's wife falsely accused her
and pressed charges.

710
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,050
Exactly.

711
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:42,420
How can this family never have a day
of peace and quiet?

712
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:44,650
The brothers-in-law
weren't causing any trouble,

713
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:48,320
so a wife of one of the brothers
turned our lives upside down.

714
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,260
Goodness.

715
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:53,800
Was Grandma Gong yelling?

716
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:56,570
It's all right.

717
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:58,670
Don't yell. You'll wake the baby.

718
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:00,740
As if you're one to talk.

719
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:03,170
Goodness, Ha Ni. Are you awake?

720
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:04,970
I'm so sorry.

721
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:06,940
You woke up
because Grandma Gong yelled.

722
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,080
- I bet that startled you.
- My gosh.

723
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,180
It's all right.

724
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:12,780
- Don't look at her!
- You've got to be kidding me.

725
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:15,350
- Don't look at her, Ha Ni.
- She's not a scary woman.

726
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,960
Unbelievable.

727
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:26,960
What?

728
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:29,500
Chun Soo.

729
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,510
He had something to say,
so I brought him here.

730
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:48,380
What...

731
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:58,490
I'm sorry.

732
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:02,800
I'm truly sorry.

733
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:05,470
Why are you apologizing?

734
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:06,600
Please get up.

735
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,100
Kwang Sook.

736
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,810
I'm sorry
I put you through this mess.

737
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:13,610
I know this startled you, Ms. Gong.

738
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,340
I'm terribly sorry.

739
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:18,280
This is all on me
and my shortcomings.

740
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:30,330
I caught up on
some much-needed sleep in the cell,

741
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:33,400
and I'm well-rested now.
You don't have to apologize.

742
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,710
From what I heard,

743
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:46,410
your wife started the fight
to get you to sign the papers.

744
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:49,380
You can't fend off
someone that determined.

745
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:54,680
That's right. It's not your fault.

746
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:58,920
Get back up.

747
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,420
Stand up.

748
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,170
I'm sorry.

749
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:16,210
I'm so sorry.

750
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:21,440
Hello? We'll be there soon.

751
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:23,450
I'm sorry.

752
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:26,520
Was that the hospital?

753
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:30,620
Yes. Let's go back, Chun Soo.

754
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,020
Yes.

755
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:35,260
You should be in bed,
not out and about.

756
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:38,760
Don't worry about Kwang Sook.

757
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:41,130
Get back and finish your treatment.

758
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:43,730
I will.

759
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:47,770
Goodness.

760
00:42:57,810 --> 00:42:59,080
It's over now.

761
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:03,150
If you had any regrets left,

762
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:07,120
this was our chance and sign
to shake it all off.

763
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:10,490
Forget about the past...

764
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:12,900
and start over.

765
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:15,560
Okay?

766
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:18,200
Yes.

767
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:32,550
- Good morning, sir.
- Morning.

(Eagle Brewery Unrefined Makgeolli)

769
00:43:42,930 --> 00:43:43,990
Let's go.

770
00:43:53,870 --> 00:43:55,640
You care about being dignified,

771
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:57,610
and you're being called
a gold digger?

772
00:43:58,110 --> 00:43:59,210
Did you say a gold digger?

773
00:43:59,310 --> 00:44:02,850
I know I'm just one
of your numerous suppliers,

774
00:44:03,210 --> 00:44:05,150
but don't you think
you're being too rude?

775
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,820
We're fighting over assets?
That's nonsense.

776
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:10,350
My sister-in-law
has made a huge sacrifice.

777

(Eagle Brewery)

778
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:20,530
A very good morning to you, CEO Ma.

779
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:25,300
Hello.

780
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,770
You're hard at work
so early in the day.

781
00:44:29,610 --> 00:44:30,610
Yes.

782
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:34,080
Do you need any help?

783
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:35,780
No, thanks.

784
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:43,520
Can you step back?
You're in the way.

785
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:44,990
I'm sorry.

(Eagle Brewery Unrefined Makgeolli)

787
00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:51,030
Did your brother-in-law
tell you we'd met?

788
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:52,490
Briefly, over the phone.

789
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:58,130
Your brother-in-law
saved my daughter from grave danger.

790
00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:00,400
It's a small world, isn't it?

791
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:04,310
It is.

792
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:11,310
Talking to your brother-in-law...

793
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:15,150
made me see
I had the wrong idea about you.

794
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,490
I'd like to apologize for that.

795
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:18,790
I'm sorry.

796
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,330
I'm glad
I'm no longer misunderstood.

797
00:45:29,830 --> 00:45:31,930
If you don't mind,
could you step aside?

798
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,200
Sure.

799
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:36,140
I'm busy and must dash.

800
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,810
I took the time to apologize.

801
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:45,780
Why is she so twisted?

802
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:54,160
Goodness.

803
00:46:06,370 --> 00:46:08,000
You're not going to do anything...

804
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:09,970
about the LX Hotel disaster?

805
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:13,240
Well, I had a few things on my mind,

806
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:15,880
but I came to ask
for your opinion first.

807
00:46:16,350 --> 00:46:18,210
Oh Jang Soo's widow.

808
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:22,020
She's all over the place
like a pony that was never trained.

809
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:25,250
We can't let her be.

810
00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:29,560
We must snap both her legs...

811
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:30,890
so she can't walk.

812
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:35,430
Yes, but she doesn't want
to sell the brewery at all.

813
00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:38,000
That crazy woman.

814
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:41,440
We can't take her head-on.

815
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:43,470
I must find another way.

816
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:46,440
What other way?

817
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:49,180
Get Planning...

818
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,580
to find out
Eagle Brewery's biggest weakness.

819
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:57,420
Whether it's money or people,
so they can never come back from it,

820
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:01,460
do whatever it takes
to find out how to deal them...

821
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:02,820
the deadliest blow.

822
00:47:03,890 --> 00:47:05,660
- Do you get it?
- "Deadliest..."

823
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,800
Yes. I get what you mean.

824
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:15,140
I tried to play nice
for dead Jang Soo's sake.

825
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:16,740
Goodness.

826
00:47:17,310 --> 00:47:19,740
She gets on my nerves too much.

827
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:32,390
Here. Give this to your father.

828
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:36,260
My husband was worried
your father looked a bit tired,

829
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:37,760
So I went to
a Korean medicine clinic myself...

830
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:38,930
and had this tonic prescribed.

831
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:41,800
You didn't have to.

832
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,830
Come on. We're family.

833
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,940
Thank you. I'll pass it to my dad.

834
00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:50,470
By the way,

835
00:47:50,770 --> 00:47:54,040
I was at your hotel's spa yesterday.

836
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,250
I saw you in the lobby.

837
00:47:56,810 --> 00:47:58,410
- Yesterday?
- Yes.

838
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:02,180
You were
with a tall, handsome young man.

839
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:05,220
Oh, Lieutenant Oh Kang Soo?

840
00:48:05,890 --> 00:48:07,490
"Lieutenant Oh Kang Soo?"

841
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:10,830
The soldier who saved me in Jinhae.

842
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:13,060
Oh, right.

843
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:17,200
Dad invited him to lunch,
so we met at the hotel.

844
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,840
I see.

845
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:27,140
You two looked lovely together.

846
00:48:29,310 --> 00:48:32,580
I heard wedding bells
the moment I saw you.

847
00:48:33,050 --> 00:48:34,850
Wedding bells? No way.

848
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,720
You're old enough.

849
00:48:38,050 --> 00:48:40,890
You could date
and things could progress.

850
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:48,530
Tell me honestly.

851
00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:51,930
Do you have feelings for him?

852
00:49:10,350 --> 00:49:11,350
Gosh.

853
00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:14,290
- Hello.
- You came in early, Professor.

854
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:16,220
I had some reading to do.

855
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:19,190
- Professor.
- Yes?

856
00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:21,060
What happened yesterday?

857
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:23,030
What?

858
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:26,540
I saw you take a call
and then rush out of the building.

859
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:28,840
You saw that?

860
00:49:29,870 --> 00:49:32,470
I got a call that my brother
had been taken to the ER.

861
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:33,610
I was in a rush.

862
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:37,610
Is he okay now?

863
00:49:38,110 --> 00:49:39,250
Yes, he's fine.

864
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:40,980
That's good to hear.

865
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:45,450
I was so worried thinking
something bad had happened to you.

866
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:47,390
What?

867
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:51,360
I see.

868
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:54,760
I'm sorry for making you worry.

869
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,770
(Na Young Eun)

870
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:24,030
(Na Young Eun)

871
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:40,340
Seon Ah.

872
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,410
Hello.

873
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:43,850
Are you going somewhere?

874
00:50:44,810 --> 00:50:47,550
Yes. I have plans.

875
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:49,850
I came to have lunch with you.

876
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:51,720
What plans are they?
Will you be back late?

877
00:50:52,490 --> 00:50:55,320
Yes.
A friend wanted to see me urgently.

878
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:56,390
I see.

879
00:50:57,130 --> 00:50:58,730
Let's have lunch some other time.

880
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:00,460
What?

881
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:02,760
Seon Ah.

882
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:04,730
Why...

883
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,650
Did you think about it?

884
00:51:25,790 --> 00:51:28,090
I'll do whatever you say.

885
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,090
Good for you.

886
00:51:31,690 --> 00:51:34,160
I'll make sure you get enough money
for the premium,

887
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:35,830
so you should move quietly.

888
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:39,530
But...

889
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,200
give me some time.

890
00:51:41,770 --> 00:51:43,440
I have to find a new place
for my academy...

891
00:51:44,970 --> 00:51:46,540
and take care of a few things.

892
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:48,680
I'll give you a week, okay?

893
00:51:52,950 --> 00:51:54,020
By the way,

894
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,650
weren't you being too bold?

895
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:00,190
How could you even try to hide...

896
00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:02,260
that you had a husband
and a daughter?

897
00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:09,760
I met my husband
in my senior year of college.

898
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:12,430
After the hospital closed down...

899
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:16,100
and my father passed away,

900
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:19,770
he was a loan shark
who came to my place every day...

901
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:21,840
to get his money back.

902
00:52:24,510 --> 00:52:26,820
Even before I had any feelings
for him,

903
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:29,380
I got pregnant with Eun Seo.

904
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:31,920
We've lived apart...

905
00:52:32,690 --> 00:52:34,160
more than we've lived together.

906
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:36,530
And now,

907
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:38,990
he's in prison.

908
00:52:46,370 --> 00:52:49,170
I was comforted a lot by Mr. Oh...

909
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:52,340
who was like an innocent boy.

910
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:54,640
For the first time in my life,

911
00:52:55,910 --> 00:52:57,380
my heart fluttered.

912
00:52:58,910 --> 00:53:00,920
I knew I didn't deserve any of it,

913
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:03,650
but I kept wanting for more.

914
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:06,990
So...

915
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:10,090
how long were you planning
on deceiving him?

916
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:15,100
I didn't plan on going
all the way anyway.

917
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:17,800
I'm actually glad...

918
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:21,000
that I can stop everything here
thanks to you.

919
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:23,240
When will your husband be released?

920
00:53:23,410 --> 00:53:24,810
In about three years.

921
00:53:26,710 --> 00:53:27,740
By the way,

922
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:31,710
when you knew everything about me,

923
00:53:32,350 --> 00:53:34,750
why did you not tell
Mr. Oh anything?

924
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:37,190
I told you.

925
00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:39,720
I don't want him to get hurt.

926
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:46,060
Think about how much
it would hurt him...

927
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:50,470
if he found out the woman
he loved so much...

928
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:53,940
had been lying to him all along.

929
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,910
I don't want him to get hurt.

930
00:54:02,310 --> 00:54:03,810
I'm telling you again.

931
00:54:04,910 --> 00:54:06,180
I want you to leave quietly.

932
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:10,890
And I'll keep this secret
from Mr. Oh until the end.

933
00:54:13,390 --> 00:54:14,820
Thank you. Please come again.

934
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:15,860
Bye.

935
00:54:24,930 --> 00:54:26,070
How are you feeling?

936
00:54:26,870 --> 00:54:28,070
I'm feeling a lot better.

937
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:32,810
I'm seeing my psychiatrist
in the afternoon.

938
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:35,310
If he says I can leave the hospital,

939
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:37,510
I think I'll be going home.

940
00:54:39,350 --> 00:54:40,650
I'm glad to hear that.

941
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:41,920
Mi Sun.

942
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:45,590
It's all thanks to you.

943
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:48,020
Thank you.

944
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:50,690
That's not true.

945
00:54:51,530 --> 00:54:52,530
Oh, right.

946
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:55,730
I forgot to tell you
something important.

947
00:54:57,530 --> 00:54:58,870
Something important?

948
00:54:59,370 --> 00:55:01,200
I got a call from the headquarters.

949
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:05,210
They liked the project proposal
you submitted last time.

950
00:55:05,810 --> 00:55:07,410
They want you to come
and give a presentation.

951
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:09,140
Really?

952
00:55:13,550 --> 00:55:15,720
We're going to make nuruk next week.

953
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:18,020
Okay.

954
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:22,990
I checked the weather forecast,
and it's supposed to be nice.

955
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:25,960
Okay.

956
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:34,670
You're so distracting
that I can't focus on work.

957
00:55:35,170 --> 00:55:38,510
Why are you roaming around
like a puppy holding number two?

958
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:52,020
What's with her?

959
00:55:52,990 --> 00:55:54,020
I don't know.

960
00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:56,260
(Eagle Brewery)

961
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:10,870
It's so dazzling.

962
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:15,140
It's been so long
since I've touched a designer bag.

963
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:22,480
There will be traces...

964
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:25,020
of her husband
everywhere in the brewery.

965
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:27,190
In such a situation,

966
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:28,960
she wouldn't want to date
another man.

967
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,290
Can't you sell the brewery...

968
00:56:30,290 --> 00:56:32,660
or let someone else take it over?

969
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:34,830
I mean,
she has four brothers-in-law.

970
00:56:34,930 --> 00:56:37,030
Isn't there anyone
who can take care of it?

971
00:56:37,930 --> 00:56:39,300
Chun Soo is perfect.

972
00:56:40,970 --> 00:56:44,040
The only way to get Kwang Sook
out of this family...

973
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:47,610
is to have Chun Soo
take over this brewery.

974
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:56,280
What?

975
00:56:57,850 --> 00:56:58,850
Where are you going?

976
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:01,260
I was on my way to the brewery
to see you.

977
00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:04,730
Why? Do you have anything
to tell me?

978
00:57:05,190 --> 00:57:07,330
What about you?
Do you have anything to tell me?

979
00:57:18,770 --> 00:57:20,140
Don't be upset
and listen to me, Mom.

980
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:22,180
You shouldn't get angry.

981
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:26,780
About Chun Soo.

982
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:30,890
I'm worried
he'd have a weak moment again,

983
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:35,360
and the brewery is too much for me
to handle on my own.

984
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:38,630
So I was thinking...

985
00:57:42,730 --> 00:57:44,970
maybe we should bring him home
and let him live with us.

986
00:57:58,310 --> 00:57:59,550
You're not yelling at me?

987
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:02,220
Do you think...

988
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:05,720
I'm a heartless person?

989
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:09,360
What?

990
00:58:09,390 --> 00:58:11,490
He got divorced
after his wife cheated on him.

991
00:58:12,090 --> 00:58:13,830
He's feeling lost and sad now.

992
00:58:14,530 --> 00:58:16,760
We should never leave him alone.

993
00:58:17,230 --> 00:58:19,470
We should stay by his side
and take care of him...

994
00:58:19,770 --> 00:58:21,100
until he pulls himself together.

995
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,310
Are you serious?

996
00:58:24,570 --> 00:58:26,210
Of course, I am.

997
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:32,550
Thank you, Mom! Thank you so much!

998
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:36,380
I'll be really nice to you.

999
00:58:42,990 --> 00:58:45,090
What? You're here.

1000
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:47,860
How are you feeling?

1001
00:58:48,830 --> 00:58:49,860
I'm fine.

1002
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:51,930
You must've been shocked
because of me.

1003
00:58:52,370 --> 00:58:53,370
I'm sorry.

1004
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:56,100
By the way, Mr. Oh,

1005
00:58:57,310 --> 00:58:59,240
I'm afraid you'll have to move out.

1006
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:01,640
What?

1007
00:59:02,010 --> 00:59:03,710
The owner is worried...

1008
00:59:03,710 --> 00:59:05,380
that what you did might hurt
the gosiwon's reputation.

1009
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:08,650
And the other tenants
aren't happy about it either.

1010
00:59:10,550 --> 00:59:11,820
I understand what you mean.

1011
00:59:13,190 --> 00:59:14,420
I'll pack my stuff and move out.

1012
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:43,650
(Areum Gosiwon)

1013
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:01,300
(Eagle Brewery)

1014
01:00:17,590 --> 01:00:18,590
Kwang Sook.

1015
01:00:19,350 --> 01:00:20,590
What are you doing here?

1016
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:21,890
Get in.

1017
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:23,120
What?

1018
01:00:23,190 --> 01:00:24,630
Let's go home.

1019
01:00:24,730 --> 01:00:26,130
Everyone is waiting.

1020
01:00:26,830 --> 01:00:28,400
Thank you for saying that, but...

1021
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:29,460
Let's go.

1022
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:31,400
Kwang Sook.

1023
01:00:31,530 --> 01:00:32,600
Get in the car.

1024
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:34,240
Kwang Sook.

1025
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:37,240
Get in.

1026
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:38,740
Kwang Sook.

1027
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:41,740
Kwang Sook...

1028
01:00:41,910 --> 01:00:42,910
Here.

1029
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:45,550
But Kwang Sook...

1030
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:48,880
Let's go.

1031
01:00:57,890 --> 01:00:59,290
(Eagle Brewery)

1032
01:00:59,590 --> 01:01:00,600
Well...

1033
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:02,900
Thank you for your consideration.

1034
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:05,200
We're sorry that we owe you again.

1035
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:07,000
Don't say that.

1036
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:09,300
We should help each other
when things are tough.

1037
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:13,980
You are a real grown-up of our time.

1038
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:16,040
I respect you.

1039
01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:18,180
No need to go that far.

1040
01:01:22,150 --> 01:01:23,150
They're here.

1041
01:01:26,950 --> 01:01:28,560
(Eagle Brewery)

1042
01:01:28,590 --> 01:01:30,990
(Eagle Brewery)

1043
01:01:44,170 --> 01:01:45,710
Welcome!

1044
01:01:54,220 --> 01:01:55,250
What's all this?

1045
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:21,380
Gosh, Chun Soo.

1046
01:02:22,180 --> 01:02:23,240
I'm glad you came.

1047
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:25,180
Let's head inside.

1048
01:02:26,810 --> 01:02:27,820
Let's go.

1049
01:02:46,970 --> 01:02:49,970
Just like that, Eagle Number Two
returned home safely.

1050
01:02:51,170 --> 01:02:53,570
His wings were torn by harsh winds,

1051
01:02:54,340 --> 01:02:58,480
but he will soon be able
to take off once again...

1052
01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:01,320
from the cozy nest
that is Eagle Brewery.

1053
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:43,930
(For Eagle Brothers)

1054
01:03:44,030 --> 01:03:45,990
I'm meeting So Yeon
at the courthouse.

1055
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:47,630
We're handing in the divorce papers.

1056
01:03:48,060 --> 01:03:49,660
Finally, it's over.

1057
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:51,700
What's with the baby?

1058
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:53,230
Why would you volunteer
to watch someone else's baby?

1059
01:03:53,230 --> 01:03:54,800
What if something happens to her?

1060
01:03:54,940 --> 01:03:56,870
Is the chairman that picky?

1061
01:03:56,870 --> 01:03:58,470
- Don't get us started.
- Don't get us started.

1062
01:03:58,470 --> 01:04:00,510
He's such a neat freak
and too picky all the time.

1063
01:04:00,510 --> 01:04:02,140
That's why he's still a widower.

1064
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:03,380
I don't just...

1065
01:04:03,710 --> 01:04:06,250
misjudge people like that.

1066
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:09,880
That's exactly what you call
abuse of power!

1067
01:04:10,250 --> 01:04:13,390
To Eagle Brewery, please.

1068
01:04:14,020 --> 01:04:15,290
Take her there.

1069
01:04:15,590 --> 01:04:16,590
Yes, sir.
