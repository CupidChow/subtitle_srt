1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:02,410
(Chairman Han Dong Seok)

2
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:04,180
I bet no one ever said no...

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,510
or rejected you in your life.

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,580
You're the first.

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,820
You got angry
because you didn't get your way,

6
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,590
and you don't care
how anyone else feels, do you?

7
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,560
Are you lecturing me?

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,830
I'm telling you
how you made me feel recently.

9
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,090
Okay, whatever.

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,200
I hope you get your way...

11
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,900
and live happily
with your brothers-in-law...

12
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,400
and stir makgeolli
for the rest of your life.

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,510
Are you cursing me?

14
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:36,810
How is that a curse?

15
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:39,240
Isn't that the life you want?

16
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,110
Yes.

17
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,280
I was...

18
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:46,850
so confused about what I wanted.

19
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,090
Hearing what you just said...

20
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,490
cleared my mind.

21
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:53,120
From now on,

22
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:55,860
I'll do as you said.

23
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:59,460
I'll live happily
with my brothers-in-law forever...

24
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,400
and make and stir makgeolli.

25
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,500
What?

26
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:08,170
I got worried,

27
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,140
felt butterflies, and wondered...

28
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:14,680
for no reason.

29
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,390
Thank you for the nice memories.

30
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:37,000
Hey. CEO Ma, wait!

31
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,320
CEO Ma, wait.

32
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,610
Kwang Sook, hey.

33
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,140
Are you done already?

34
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:19,580
Yes, let's go.

35
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,200
Did something happen, Kwang Sook?

36
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,240
No. Why do you ask?

37
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,110
You seem to be in a bad mood.

38
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,840
Actually, I couldn't be happier.

39
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:56,850
We just signed a deal to export.
I'm over the moon.

40
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,250
The more I think about it,

41
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,890
the more grateful I am
to the hotel's chairman.

42
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:08,360
He was the first to resume
selling Jang-Kwang Makgeolli...

43
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,600
and helped us secure an export deal.

44
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:14,470
We should invite him to dinner
as a token of our gratitude.

45
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:18,200
What? Forget it.

46
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:20,940
What?

47
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:24,910
That power-tripping boomer.

48
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,180
Who?

49
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,510
Who else but the hotel's chairman?

50
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:39,660
I'm coming in.

51
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:40,660
Sure.

52
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,500
Why are you looking at me like that?

53
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,340
Why do women fall
for guys like you...

54
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,380
who aren't very romantic
and tend to be standoffish?

55
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,580
Be honest with me,
and tell me the truth.

56
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,250
What's your secret?

57
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,920
Enough with the nonsense.

58
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:10,050
Do you seem unapproachable
only to us?

59
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:13,020
You become a sweet romantic
in front of the ladies, right?

60
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,430
Honestly, I was taken aback...

61
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,500
when I heard she was Dokgo Tak
and Ms. Jang's daughter.

62
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,330
But I'm an artist.

63
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:22,500
I'm open-minded
and ready to embrace anything.

64
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:25,370
A man
who tragically falls in love...

65
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:28,770
with the enemy's daughter turned out
to be my brother.

66
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:32,610
My gosh.
Bring on the artistic inspiration.

67
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,310
Hey, Beom Soo.

68
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,820
Let me know your secret. Beom Soo?

69
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,150
- Ha Ni.
- Hey.

70
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,950
- Your dad must be off to work.
- Daddy's here.

71
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,220
It's all right.

72
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,890
Have fun
with your babysitter, Ha Ni.

73
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,360
Peekaboo.

74
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,430
Ms. Gong, what's your take on this?

75
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:54,870
On what?

76
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:56,570
A man
who tragically falls in love...

77
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:58,000
with the enemy's daughter.

78
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,510
Stop it, will you?

79
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:03,340
Even enemies can be categorized
into certain classes.

80
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:06,980
The one from before
was far too rude.

81
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,180
I don't care how angry he was.

82
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,250
How could he slap the face...

83
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:14,150
of the man his daughter likes?

84
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:17,320
That was uncivilized,
to say the least.

85
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,860
- We're back.
- Hey.

86
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,430
- You're back.
- Hey, guys.

87
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,700
Did you sign the contract?

88
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,100
Yes, and we appreciate the concern.

89
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,630
That jerk Dokgo Tak
will faint from shock...

90
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:31,040
once he hears our makgeolli
is being exported.

91
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,510
No way.

92
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,740
What... What do you mean?

93
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,980
You and Dokgo Tak's daughter.
That can never happen.

94
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,380
Love can't pay the bills,

95
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,480
and people rarely change
their minds.

96
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,090
Don't be pulled in by this,
and make the right decision.

97
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:50,120
Sure.

98
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,560
I finally understand those mothers
in soap operas.

99
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,430
Over my dead body!

100
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,630
You and Dokgo Tak's daughter
can never...

101
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,970
be together.

102
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:03,130
Right.

103
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:06,500
- Goodness.
- Ha Ni, wait.

104
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,910
- It's okay.
- Ha Ni.

105
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,410
Why did she channel
her inner drama queen,

106
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,110
- frightening the baby?
- It's all right.

107
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:13,480
- It's all right.
- Goodness.

108
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,480
Tell me about it.

109
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,510
Did something upset her
at the hotel?

110
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,150
I can't see what it could've been.

111
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,450
We happily signed the contract.

112
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:22,290
But something's been off about her.

113
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,340
Where are you going?

114
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,780
If you don't want
to trouble Professor Oh any further,

115
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,520
you need to get your act together.

116
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,750
It's best if you don't go to class.

117
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,720
Are you telling me to drop out?

118
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,560
Take a break
and study abroad instead.

119
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:00,490
Study abroad?

120
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:02,490
That option...

121
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:05,830
works best for you and Professor Oh.

122
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:09,870
I'm not interested
in going abroad to study some more.

123
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:12,500
Your dad went to
Professor Oh's house.

124
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:14,670
What?

125
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,840
You know what your dad's like.

126
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:20,310
He barged in there at night
and got physical with the family.

127
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,650
He even slapped Professor Oh
in the face.

128
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,250
What?

129
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,120
If you don't want to make his life
any harder,

130
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,920
it's best to let go of this crush.

131
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,860
You can't beat him.

132
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:36,690
This is the worst.

133
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,200
Se Ri.

134
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:49,940
This is karma.

135
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,780
I'm being punished.

136
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,580
Hello?

137
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,950
It's me, Lieutenant Oh.

138
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:02,820
Is it okay to talk?

139
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,960
Sure. Just a second.

140
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,130
Okay. Go ahead.

141
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:21,010
Did my parents really go to...

142
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,440
Professor Oh's house?

143
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:25,040
Yes, I guess you've heard.

144
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:26,880
Then,

145
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:30,110
is it true that my dad
slapped Professor Oh in the face?

146
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,350
Yes, it's true.

147
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:38,890
I never even dreamed
of this happening.

148
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,730
Professor Oh must be livid.

149
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,670
Your family must've been lost
for words.

150
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,270
We were all lost for words...

151
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:52,340
and flustered, yes.

152
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,270
Give me your home address.

153
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:57,780
Where we live?

154
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,280
Yes, please.

155
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:05,950
Is something wrong?

156
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:08,190
I was on the phone with Se Ri.

157
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,220
How are things going
with her and your brother?

158
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,360
It looks tough.

159
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:21,830
Are preparations
for next month's golf outing...

160
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:23,230
for our VIP clients going well?

161
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,300
Yes.

162
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,100
We sent the finalized invitation
to the printer.

163
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:30,410
What about the banners
we need to set up?

164
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,540
- I sent them off this morning.
- Good.

165
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:40,950
My daughter...

166
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:43,850
canceled her wedding because of you.

167
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,060
You're a homewrecker!

168
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:48,060
You seduced a young student...

169
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,660
and ruined her future.

170
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:53,300
You've got no right
to be called a professor!

171
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,630
Professor?

172
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,000
Yes?

173
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,770
It's time to head to your lecture.

174
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:02,670
Oh, it is. Thanks.

175
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,380
- Hello.
- Hello.

176
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,410
Hi.

177
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:29,670
Where's Se Ri?

178
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,040
She didn't go to class, did she?

179
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,270
She's in her room.

180
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,410
Shall I put her on?

181
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,080
Leave it.

182
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:42,410
Even if it means she dies single
and becomes a vengeful ghost,

183
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:44,420
I won't let her marry Beom Soo.

184
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:49,690
Why won't you answer?

185
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,960
Why do you expect an answer
to an obvious question?

186
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,490
It's a waste of breath.

187
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:00,900
He won't have his job for long.

188
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,100
What does that mean?

189
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,740
I need to get rid of him...

190
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:09,070
so he doesn't cross paths
with Se Ri again.

191
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:11,240
What do you mean, "get rid of him?"

192
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,410
It will ruin the surprise
if I tell you now.

193
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,810
Wait and see.

194
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:18,420
What are you plotting this time?

195
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,890
Do you have to talk about me
like that?

196
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,020
I don't plot!

197
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:26,160
I'm trying to talk Se Ri
into agreeing...

198
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,760
to go abroad to study.

199
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:32,200
I'll sort this out on my end.

200
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,130
Can you please not do anything?

201
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:36,630
Don't make things worse.

202
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,170
Why should she go abroad?

203
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:39,800
Why should Se Ri run away...

204
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,570
when he's in the wrong?

205
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:44,240
Se Ri gets all these silly ideas...

206
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,240
because you're too soft with her!

207
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,250
Okay, fine.

208
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,780
Do whatever you want!

209
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,360
(CEO Dokgo Tak)

210
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,390
Darn her.

211
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,960
How dare she hang up on me?

212
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:06,430
Those Eagle Brewery people...

213
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:07,730
are always in my way.

214
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:09,970
Darn them.

215
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,940
Take a look.

216
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,540
Is something the matter?

217
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:19,140
I'm taking a look at the hose.
There seems to be a hole in it.

218
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,350
I told you to check the equipment
in advance!

219
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,320
Shouldn't you be prepared?

220
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,420
Do better from now on.

221
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,890
(Eagle Brewery)

222
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,830
What's up with her today?

223
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:37,090
She's almost hysterical.

224
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,500
She is.

225
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,130
I'm so scared.

226
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:45,400
(Pot Number 6)

227
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,810
I hope you get your way...

228
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:53,480
and live happily
with your brothers-in-law...

229
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,910
and stir makgeolli
for the rest of your life.

230
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,450
My gosh.

231
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,650
Darn it.

232
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:03,220
I'm getting more annoyed
by the second.

233
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,460
I hate his guts.

234
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,580
I got worried,

235
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:29,450
felt butterflies, and wondered...

236
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,120
for no reason.

237
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:37,890
Thank you for the nice memories.

238
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:43,160
I should've figured out
how she really felt.

239
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,830
I was too rash.

240
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,640
(Ma Kwang)

241
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,080
Yes?

242
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,850
It's time for your meeting, sir.

243
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,420
Okay.

244
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:20,760
Is she out?

245
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,800
Ok Bun.

246
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,600
Ji Ok Bun.

247
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,240
Yes, Heung Soo.

248
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,670
What are you doing? Are you busy?

249
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,240
Give me a moment.

250
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,240
I'll leave if you're busy.

251
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,680
Heung Soo.

252
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:07,680
What's this?

253
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,580
I didn't recognize you.

254
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,280
Why?

255
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:16,120
Do I look weird?

256
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,490
No. It's not weird at all.

257
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,060
Shall I perm my hair again?

258
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,500
No, don't. Not ever.

259
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:29,630
What expression is that?

260
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:31,100
What?

261
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,810
It looks like you've fallen for me.

262
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:42,350
Goodness.

263
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:45,220
Do you think
you're a princess or something?

264
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:49,350
I'm a woman too.
If a guy were to say...

265
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,160
I was pretty,
my heart would beat faster.

266
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:56,260
It's not my type,
but it's not a bad look.

267
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,730
Why are you here?

268
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:02,100
I dropped by on the way to work.

269
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:04,030
Hey, nice.

270
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,040
You're working really hard, then.

271
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:08,610
I have to prep the ingredients
and practice making a few items.

272
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:10,810
I was at the store
until 3 a.m. last night.

273
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,180
I missed the last bus...

274
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,610
and slept at the store.

275
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:16,750
Oh, my goodness.

276
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,350
- Hey.
- Good for you.

277
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:19,850
You can't do that.
It's embarrassing.

278
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:23,150
Why would I be embarrassed
when it's between us?

279
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,120
And I thought
things were going well.

280
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:26,920
Bye.

281
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,860
He's such a boomer.

282
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:35,470
You can drop by in the evening.

283
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,000
I'll make you a toast.

284
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,970
Okay.

285
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,640
Okay.

286
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,980
Is that really Ok Bun?

287
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,390
She looks so different
in straight hair.

288
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,760
A blind date?

289
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,430
Do I have to meet her?

290
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:08,000
She has the calm, Asian look,

291
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:10,030
and she seems like
she'd make a good wife and mom.

292
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,240
To be honest, my type...

293
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,670
You nailed it.

294
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,140
But the idea of a blind date...

295
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:20,580
at my age is pretty embarrassing.

296
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,780
Okay, fine.

297
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:26,250
I'll go on the darn date.
Stop shouting.

298
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,050
She hung up.

299
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:31,590
Her crazy temper...

300
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,820
You scared me.

301
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,460
What?

302
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,800
Let's see the photo.

303
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,400
My gosh.

304
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,740
She has a dreadful-looking face.

305
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:50,610
You can read faces?

306
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,540
I attended a talk on face reading
and fortune telling...

307
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,810
at Golden Castle.

308
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:56,010
Oh, I see.

309
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,180
You can have the best fortune,

310
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,550
but a bad look can ruin that.

311
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,720
That's how important one's face is.

312
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:04,050
I'd like to speak nicely of her...

313
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:05,560
since she's your date, but...

314
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:08,960
She's not for you.

315
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,130
How so?

316
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,260
This woman could be widowed...

317
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,430
before she turns 60.

318
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:18,200
She can't manage money,
which means she'll spend everything,

319
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,870
and she's temperamental
and stubborn.

320
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:23,770
She's someone
who should never marry.

321
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:26,480
Being widowed
means her husband dies.

322
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:29,080
Is her face seriously that bad?

323
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:31,520
It's the worst I've seen in my life.

324
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,250
You should think again...

325
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,350
about going on that date.

326
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:55,440
(Eagle Brewery)

327
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,940
How may I help you?

328
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,480
Is this...

329
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,580
the brewery run
by Professor Oh Beom Soo's family?

330
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,560
To make yakju for export,

331
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,890
we will need to get
a filter press first.

332
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:18,130
Since the bank loans are blocked,

333
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:21,330
we will probably have to find
another way to get the money.

334
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:24,170
We have a visitor.

335
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,910
Hello.

336
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,780
I'm Dokgo Se Ri.

337
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:40,320
Dokgo Se Ri?

338
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,420
Dokgo Tak?

339
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,820
Are you his daughter?

340
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:51,190
Yes, I am. He's my dad.

341
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,470
Yesterday, her dad came here
and caused a scene.

342
00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:00,300
And what is his daughter here
for today?

343
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:05,140
Let's hear...

344
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,340
what she has to say first.

345
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:10,150
Have a seat.

346
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:31,640
She's nothing like her parents.

347
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,400
I know.

348
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,040
I came to apologize.

349
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,840
Apologize?

350
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:46,020
I just decided not to marry
the man my parents chose for me,

351
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,050
but they thought
it was Professor Oh's fault...

352
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:52,290
and did such a ridiculous thing.

353
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:56,860
I thought it was right for me
to come and apologize in person,

354
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:59,430
so I came to see you.

355
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,560
I see.

356
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:04,900
Does Beom Soo know that you're here?

357
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:08,370
No, he has no idea.

358
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:12,140
Then how did you find this place?

359
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:14,980
I asked Lieutenant Oh Kang Soo.

360
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:17,910
Do you know Kang Soo?

361
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,480
Yes.

362
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,990
He works with my friend.

363
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,190
So I met him a few times.

364
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:25,460
Wait.

365
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,960
What we want to know...

366
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:32,730
is what your relationship
between you and Beom Soo is.

367
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:35,200
That's what we need to know.

368
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:43,340
I have feelings...

369
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:46,840
for Professor Oh.

370
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:56,350
Then...

371
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:59,560
is it that you have a crush on him?

372
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:00,860
Or...

373
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:03,730
I'm not sure
how Professor Oh is feeling.

374
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,460
But...

375
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:08,830
I'm planning to wait...

376
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:10,270
until he likes me back.

377
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,970
When your parents are against it?

378
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:17,810
Yes.

379
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,840
Oh, dear.

380
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,450
It's Se Ri, right?

381
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:26,720
Your family and we can never be...

382
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,690
in a good relationship.

383
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,290
It's an ill-fated relationship.

384
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,930
What does that mean?

385
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:38,560
Let me make it simple for you.

386
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:41,570
You and Beom Soo are...

387
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:45,170
like Romeo and Juliet.

388
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:50,770
Are you saying there's something...

389
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:53,540
between my parents
and Professor Oh's family?

390
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,050
Well...

391
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:58,050
She doesn't seem to know anything.

392
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:00,520
So I'm saying...

393
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,590
That's enough, Mom.

394
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:04,220
We understand what you're saying.

395
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,260
You can leave now.

396
00:23:08,290 --> 00:23:10,060
I'm really sorry for what happened.

397
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:17,930
What?

398
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,910
Aren't these my mom and dad?

399
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,220
It's my parents, right?

400
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,690
Yes, they are your parents.

401
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,890
Why are my parents here...

402
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:47,560
Your mom and dad
used to work here with me.

403
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:49,430
Then...

404
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:53,300
does that mean
Professor Oh knew my parents?

405
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,840
I'm home.

406
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:09,420
Se Ri.

407
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,060
How could you think of coming here?

408
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:23,900
I heard my dad made a scene here.

409
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:27,140
I felt so bad
that I had to do something.

410
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,040
It wasn't just about you.

411
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:34,180
I felt terrible for your family too.

412
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:39,280
I thought it was right for me
to come and apologize in person.

413
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,620
I heard my dad even slapped you
in the face.

414
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:50,390
I'm really sorry.

415
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:53,230
Your dad thinks...

416
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:55,900
I'm the one who made you
call off your marriage,

417
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,030
so that's understandable.

418
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,040
I feel so embarrassed and ashamed.

419
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:06,240
It's not your fault, Se Ri.
Don't worry about it.

420
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:19,020
Why are you crying?

421
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:33,170
Here.

422
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:41,650
Let's go now.

423
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,280
Well...

424
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,480
Wait, Professor.

425
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,790
I heard...

426
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:53,360
my parents used to work here.

427
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:57,230
Yes, they did.

428
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:00,300
Then does that mean...

429
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,830
you already knew my parents?

430
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,870
But why didn't you tell me anything?

431
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,110
Is it because...

432
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:18,380
my parents did something
to harm your family?

433
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,420
Well...

434
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:25,090
Before I tell you anything,

435
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:27,920
I think you should hear it
from your parents.

436
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:39,200
Did the girl leave?

437
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:41,740
Yes. She left.

438
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:45,980
She made it clear
that she had feelings for you.

439
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,380
How are you feeling about her?

440
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:56,720
It's not like...

441
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:00,160
you have no feelings for her at all.

442
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:05,630
They embezzled the company's money
30 years ago,

443
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:09,070
and they recently spread
a slander video...

444
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:10,670
to put our brewery in danger.

445
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:13,640
And now you have something to do
with their daughter.

446
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:16,740
I'm not happy about that.

447
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,180
She was nothing
like her parents though.

448
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:29,350
Still, I don't think
it is a good idea...

449
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:31,920
to get involved with someone
from the family.

450
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,630
Nothing has been decided yet,

451
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:38,360
so don't get ahead of yourself.

452
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:41,400
I'll be in my room.

453
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:03,090
Beom Soo seems to like her as well.

454
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,360
He's usually clear and decisive
with every decision he makes.

455
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:08,630
Based on what he said,
it seems he likes her too.

456
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:13,030
I know it's a small world,

457
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:14,830
but why did it have
to be Dokgo Tak's daughter?

458
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,570
Talk about ill-fated.

459
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,840
Tell me about it.

460
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,750
Is something up with you,
Kwang Sook?

461
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:31,580
Why do you ask?

462
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:34,120
You've been in a sour mood
ever since we left the hotel.

463
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:36,920
I see.

464
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:45,900
(Pot Number 4)

465
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,640
I thought making the decision...

466
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,040
would take the weight off my chest.

467
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:06,450
But why have I been feeling down
all day?

468
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:14,190
(Chairman Han Dong Seok)

469
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:17,830
Come in.

470
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:26,140
Aren't you heading home, sir?

471
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:30,240
I didn't realize it was this late.

472
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:32,310
Should I tell Mr. Kim
to bring the car around?

473
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:35,680
No, I'll drive myself home.

474
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,780
Just tell Mr. Kim to leave the key
at the front desk and go home.

475
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,380
Yes, sir.

476
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,640
(Pot Number 4)

477
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,510
(Eagle Brewery)

478
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,820
Hello?

479
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,950
Where are you right now?

480
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,860
I'm at the brewery.

481
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:21,820
Then, could you meet me outside?

482
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:24,460
Sorry?

483
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,040
(Eagle Brewery)

484
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:42,680
What brings you here this time?

485
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:45,850
Why else?

486
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:48,380
You stormed off earlier,

487
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,420
and I needed to clear the air.

488
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:53,920
Clear the air?

489
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,660
(Eagle Brewery)

490
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,230
I'm sorry.

491
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,940
I met my late wife
when I was a college freshman.

492
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,800
We dated all through college...

493
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,510
and got married before graduation.

494
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:14,310
I've been single for 15 years
since she passed away.

495
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:18,210
I'm embarrassed to say this,

496
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:23,420
but my only dating experience
was with my wife.

497
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:29,090
That's why I lack finesse
and can sometimes come across...

498
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:31,560
as childish and selfish.

499
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,530
I admit that.

500
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:41,140
Should I call it dating muscle?

501
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,510
I...

502
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,910
don't have any.

503
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,280
Going through rejection,

504
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:52,480
breakups,

505
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,490
and arguments can make you
better at dating.

506
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:58,760
You become more relaxed...

507
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,490
and worry less.

508
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:03,960
I only cared about
my wounded heart...

509
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:08,260
and behaved in a childish
and foolish way.

510
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,370
I can't say...

511
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:21,040
that I acted any differently...

512
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,610
from you.

513
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:31,650
I only just realized
that my late wife...

514
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,430
spent her whole life catering...

515
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:37,190
to my every whim.

516
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,000
Likewise.

517
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:44,300
Anyway,

518
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:46,200
I'm sorry.

519
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:49,810
It's all my fault.

520
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:55,580
It's not like I handled this
any better.

521
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,220
During those ten days,

522
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:01,320
I should've tried...

523
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,590
to dig deeper into my feelings.

524
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:09,230
I couldn't keep my word.

525
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:11,760
Don't say that.

526
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,960
You kept your word to a tee.

527
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,030
- Sorry?
- You said so earlier.

528
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:23,070
You were worried,
felt butterflies, and wondered...

529
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:24,440
for those ten days.

530
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:28,280
I never said I felt butterflies.

531
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:31,980
I know what I heard,
and that's what you said.

532
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,790
You only get worried,
feel butterflies, and wonder...

533
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:37,320
about someone...

534
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:40,260
because you have let that person in.

535
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:44,060
You shouldn't blow it
out of proportion like that.

536
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,760
- I only meant...
- CEO Ma,

537
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:48,260
you just have to watch what I do...

538
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:50,300
from now on.

539
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:54,370
You were struggling,

540
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:57,510
concerned, and unsure,
and I get all that now.

541
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:03,710
One by one, I'll resolve all that.

542
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:09,690
Leave it all to me, okay?

543
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,190
You're just so coy.

544
00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:21,260
Who are you calling coy?

545
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:24,330
Coy has never been part
of my vocabulary.

546
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:28,170
CEO Ma, you're unmistakably coy.

547
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,110
I'll get going.

548
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:35,780
My gosh.

549
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,290
Are you kidding me?
He's running his mouth again.

550
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:45,860
Who's he to make me out to be coy?

551
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,680
Did you replace the hose?

552
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:11,410
Yes, boss.

553
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:14,620
Even with daily inspections,
we keep running into problems.

554
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:17,390
Good job.

555
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:25,090
She must be
on an emotional roller coaster.

556
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:28,160
Is she already menopausal?

557
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:29,970
Tell me about it.

558
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:36,740
(Pot Number 4)

559
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:58,830
- You're home.
- You're home.

560
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,630
You're both home earlier than usual.

561
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:04,630
Gyeol has something to say to you.

562
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:07,740
Sure. Let's sit.

563
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,710
Is it something serious?

564
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:20,780
Yes.

565
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,020
What is it?

566
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,860
It's about my wedding.

567
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,030
I won't be marrying Se Ri.

568
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:31,730
We broke up.

569
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,400
What?

570
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:36,170
But why?

571
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:38,940
I approached this marriage
too easily.

572
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:44,510
I've been fond of Se Ri
since we were kids,

573
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:46,780
and I thought marriage
was the next step for us.

574
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:49,350
It dawned on me...

575
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:51,810
that a lifelong partner
requires more than that.

576
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:55,750
Are you sure that's the only reason?

577
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,260
There must be something
you can't share with me...

578
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,630
in detail right now,

579
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:06,430
but let me know
once things are sorted out.

580
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,900
Sure, I will.

581
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:11,500
Did Se Ri also agree to this?

582
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:14,100
Yes, we're on the same page.

583
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,340
Do her parents also know?

584
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:19,340
Yes, they do.

585
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:22,350
Goodness.

586
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:24,610
Are you sure about this?

587
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:27,850
Honestly, I'm still in a daze.

588
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,820
But I've started feeling better.

589
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:35,290
I'm finally admitting it now,

590
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,430
but I was fond of Se Ri
and grew attached to her...

591
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:40,400
because she was Bom's friend.

592
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:44,730
However, I had some reservations
about her parents.

593
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:48,800
It appeared that they were
somewhat different from us.

594
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:51,210
I know what you mean.

595
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:55,080
I'll head upstairs first, then.

596
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,450
Se Ri never really
talked about Gyeol...

597
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:07,220
when we hung out,

598
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,890
so I was surprised to hear
they were getting married.

599
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:13,830
This is how it turned out.

600
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:17,800
Was an error made
on your brother's end?

601
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:20,340
It's not his fault at all.

602
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:24,510
We're good, then.

603
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:32,880
How did you and Dad first meet?

604
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:35,990
What? Why are you asking me that?

605
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:39,190
You don't really tell me
when I ask about things in the past.

606
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,560
Where else could we have met?

607
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,130
At work, of course.

608
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:44,530
Was it an office romance?

609
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:48,030
An office romance?

610
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:51,830
Well, I guess you can call it that.

611
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:57,370
Let me make it simple for you.

612
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:59,740
You and Beom Soo are...

613
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:03,510
like Romeo and Juliet.

614
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,850
There's definitely a story
behind this.

615
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,390
Where did you go earlier?

616
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:17,030
I went to Eagle Brewery.

617
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,200
Why would you go there?

618
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,040
Dad was way out of line,

619
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,870
so the least I could do
was apologize.

620
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:30,040
How dare you go to that brewery?

621
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:33,240
Professor Oh and his family
did nothing wrong.

622
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:36,110
They didn't deserve
to be humiliated by Dad.

623
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,380
Don't you dare tell your dad...

624
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,990
that you were at the brewery.

625
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:45,760
So,

626
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:48,390
did you meet the family?

627
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:50,430
Yes.

628
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,460
Did they say anything unusual?

629
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,930
Unusual as in what?

630
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:02,040
It's nothing.

631
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:05,840
Mom.

632
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:09,410
Don't you have anything
to say to me?

633
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,180
Like what?

634
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,320
Stay away from that family.

635
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:38,540
We need to send Se Ri abroad
this second.

636
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:40,410
Again with this nonsense.

637
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:45,110
Why should she have to run away
when she did nothing wrong?

638
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:47,750
What's the point
of spending a fortune...

639
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:50,120
just to send her abroad to suffer,
far away from her family?

640
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,090
While trying to save a few bucks,

641
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:55,120
we could end up scarring her
for life.

642
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:56,490
What are you talking about?

643
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:58,990
Given her relationship
with Beom Soo,

644
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:01,630
it won't be long
before she figures out...

645
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:03,170
that we used to work
at Eagle Brewery.

646
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:06,070
Then, she'll find out
we embezzled from them...

647
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:07,240
No way!

648
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:09,910
Exactly.

649
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:12,910
That's why we must send her abroad
as soon as possible.

650
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:23,750
I'm home.

651
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,220
Hey, did you have a good day?

652
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,390
You, Oh Kang Soo.

653
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:33,400
Why would you do something
nobody asked you to do?

654
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:36,870
How could you tell Se Ri
our home address?

655
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:40,040
She wanted to know
so she could apologize.

656
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,340
How could I say no?

657
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:44,810
Judging from our conversation,

658
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:46,540
she appeared thoughtful, polite,

659
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,610
and decent.

660
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:51,110
Her only flaw is who her father is.

661
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,390
Se Ri genuinely cares about you.

662
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:59,690
Whatever. Everyone, just drop this.

663
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:06,660
He likes her too, doesn't he?

664
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,630
He likes Se Ri too.

665
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,900
This is concerning.

666
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:37,160
Are you all right?

667
00:42:56,650 --> 00:42:57,650
Mi Sun.

668
00:42:58,210 --> 00:42:59,210
Hey.

669
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:00,580
Hey.

670
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,250
I bet I made you wait.

671
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:04,950
Hardly. I just got here myself.

672
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:06,860
Let's head inside.

673
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,330
From the left, jujube, chestnut,
pear, and persimmon.

674
00:43:15,330 --> 00:43:16,500
Red fruit on the left
and white fruit on the right.

675
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:19,130
You know formality matters, right?

676
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,800
I don't think I should bother
when it's just me.

677
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:24,710
I'm going to buy some plump fruit,

678
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:26,680
make some jeon
and seasoned vegetables,

679
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,310
and serve them with rice and soup.

680
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,950
I'll peel the chestnuts, then.

681
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:33,250
Thanks.

682
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:35,580
This...

683
00:43:39,890 --> 00:43:42,060
Try some beef jerky.

684
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:43,660
It pairs incredibly well
with alcohol.

685
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:46,860
You should buy some to have it
when you and your wife have a drink.

686
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:53,540
Let's give it a taste.

687
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:54,640
Sure.

688
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,550
This is perfect to have
with makgeolli.

689
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:07,350
You're right.

690
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:10,650
You seem inseparable.

691
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,190
They say married couples grow alike.

692
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:15,390
You almost seem like siblings
who get along.

693
00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:17,130
This is sweet.

694
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,430
Let's buy a packet, honey.

695
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:32,610
We'll take one.

696
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,500
I know it's been a while,
but can I also greet him?

697
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:56,670
Of course.

698
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:20,420
Mr. Mun.

699
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:23,830
I'm Oh Chun Soo,

700
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:25,960
the second son of Eagle Brewery.

701
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,500
It's been a while.

702
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:32,370
I probably startled you
when I bowed after Mi Sun.

703
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:36,910
You must've been worried about her
being all alone,

704
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,610
but now you can rest in peace.

705
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:42,540
I'll take good care of her...

706
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:45,480
in your stead.

707
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:48,580
I won't let you down.

708
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,510
Why are you here, Heung Soo?

709
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:19,750
I can't seem to shake
this nervous feeling.

710
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:21,250
What do you mean?

711
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:23,220
What if I open the store tomorrow...

712
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:24,820
and no one shows up?

713
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:28,220
That will never happen.

714
00:46:28,790 --> 00:46:30,860
I agreed to this recklessly,

715
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:32,960
and now my heart is racing...

716
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,300
at the thought of opening the store.

717
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:37,600
I can't seem to calm myself down.

718
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:43,670
Should I get you a calming pill?

719
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,180
Forget the calming pill.

720
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:52,850
Can you just sit here with me?

721
00:46:56,190 --> 00:46:57,420
What's the occasion?

722
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:04,290
You asked me to sit next to you?

723
00:47:08,130 --> 00:47:10,300
Not that close.

724
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:12,200
Stay away.

725
00:47:12,470 --> 00:47:15,040
You're way too demanding.

726
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,810
Don't perm your hair again.

727
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:25,610
It's pretty right now.

728
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:32,350
Be honest.

729
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:37,730
You fell for me, didn't you?

730
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:42,500
You're going overboard again.

731
00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:45,370
If you feel that anxious,

732
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:48,170
shall I stay with you tonight?

733
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:49,540
What?

734
00:47:51,710 --> 00:47:54,640
No. You and I... You're an investor,

735
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,280
and I'm a store owner.

736
00:47:58,080 --> 00:47:59,310
Let's not cross the line.

737
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,950
I should go.

738
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:09,690
Goodness.

739
00:48:10,330 --> 00:48:12,260
Does he think I'll bite?

740
00:48:13,130 --> 00:48:14,530
Why is he so flustered?

741
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:23,640
You were struggling,

742
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:27,380
concerned, and unsure,
and I get all that now.

743
00:48:28,910 --> 00:48:32,380
One by one, I'll resolve all that.

744
00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:36,080
Leave it all to me, okay?

745
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:40,790
He goes and does whatever he wants.

746
00:48:54,870 --> 00:48:56,100
You're just so coy.

747
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:58,340
Who are you calling coy?

748
00:48:58,710 --> 00:49:01,680
Coy has never been part
of my vocabulary.

749
00:49:16,190 --> 00:49:17,960
(We wish you success.)

(Eagle Brewery)

751
00:49:28,270 --> 00:49:29,540
I'll help her.

752
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:31,870
- Here.
- Okay.

753
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:33,210
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

754
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:36,680
Let's go.

755
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:38,480
(Congratulations
on your grand opening!)

756
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,280
(May your business thrive.)

757
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:48,860
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

758
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:52,560
How nice.

759
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:55,530
Oh, my gosh. Welcome.

760
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:57,300
Heung Soo.

761
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,200
Okay.

762
00:50:00,370 --> 00:50:02,440
- Hello.
- Congratulations!

763
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,540
You changed your hairstyle.

764
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:06,680
Congratulations, Ms. Investor.

765
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:07,840
I'll take it.

766
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:10,150
I decided to change my look.

767
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:11,410
Does it suit me?

768
00:50:11,410 --> 00:50:12,750
You look so much nicer.

769
00:50:13,450 --> 00:50:14,720
Thank you.

770
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:18,150
The store's bigger than I thought.

771
00:50:18,490 --> 00:50:20,290
There are lots of customers,

772
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:21,820
and the atmosphere's great too.

773
00:50:22,490 --> 00:50:23,530
Yes.

774
00:50:23,530 --> 00:50:26,130
You look like a boss now.

775
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:28,460
It's a crazy first day.

776
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,000
You two look great together.

777
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,000
You could pass for newlyweds.

778
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:41,010
You're at it again.

779
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:43,710
We're sticking to our investor
and store owner relationship.

780
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:47,250
He says that all the time.

781
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:48,480
Come on.

782
00:50:49,850 --> 00:50:52,650
Beom Soo and Kang Soo
will drop by after work.

783
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:53,820
Yes, they called.

784
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,930
Take a seat.
I'll make you some toast right away.

785
00:50:56,930 --> 00:50:58,260
Sit over here.

786
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,600
Thank you, Ok Bun,

787
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:11,640
for helping Heung Soo start over.

788
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:16,650
I hope he does well
and doesn't let you down.

789
00:51:17,350 --> 00:51:19,750
I watched him
prepare to open the store...

790
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:22,520
and saw he's hardworking
and responsible.

791
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,490
Don't worry too much.

792
00:51:26,990 --> 00:51:28,990
You're such a supportive young lady.

793
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:31,560
I wonder what Heung Soo did...

794
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:34,030
to deserve meeting someone like you.

795
00:51:34,830 --> 00:51:38,030
He's the only one
who doesn't see that.

796
00:51:38,670 --> 00:51:40,440
Yes, hi.

797
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:41,670
It won't be long.

798
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:43,940
No.

799
00:51:44,110 --> 00:51:47,340
He bragged about you to us
so much recently.

800
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:48,480
Did he really?

801
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:50,180
Yes.

802
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:51,810
We all heard him, didn't we?

803
00:51:51,810 --> 00:51:53,050
Yes, we did.

804
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:55,220
Heung Soo can grumble a lot,

805
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:57,390
but he's very grateful
for what you did.

(Silla Brewery)

808
00:52:12,930 --> 00:52:14,040
Darn it.

809
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:21,940
To what do I owe a call...

810
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:24,380
from the busy Chairman Han?

811
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:27,450
You heard about the kids,
didn't you?

812
00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:30,950
It's a shame they broke up,

813
00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:35,120
but I called because I thought
we adults should talk...

814
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:36,460
to end it officially.

815
00:52:37,930 --> 00:52:39,330
Kids these days don't do...

816
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:42,130
something just because
their parents tell them to.

817
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,470
They do what they want.

818
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:47,540
I've given up already.

819
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:48,700
Okay.

820
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:50,840
It wasn't meant to be.

821
00:52:51,810 --> 00:52:54,640
I hope you don't scold Se Ri.

822
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:58,450
I'll console Gyeol as best I can.

823
00:52:59,350 --> 00:53:01,020
Sure, let's do that.

824
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:08,160
He called right away...

825
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:10,030
to shut things down for good...

826
00:53:10,030 --> 00:53:11,390
as if he were waiting for the news.

827
00:53:13,430 --> 00:53:16,030
I don't want my daughter
to marry your son anymore.

828
00:53:16,970 --> 00:53:19,600
Wait and see. I'll marry Se Ri...

829
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:21,100
into a much richer family.

830
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,010
Darn it.

831
00:53:24,670 --> 00:53:25,770
You're hungry, right?

832
00:53:25,770 --> 00:53:27,040
- Let's eat.
- Yes, let's.

833
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:32,450
Hi.

834
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:34,350
Academic Affairs called.

835
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:37,190
The head of their office
wants to see you.

837
00:53:43,730 --> 00:53:45,390
We received a letter about you.

838
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:47,060
A letter?

839
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:50,270
We destroy anonymous letters
upon arrival...

840
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,100
and don't care about the content.

841
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:54,770
But there's a rule
that we must investigate...

842
00:53:54,770 --> 00:53:57,040
when names are named
in such a letter.

843
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:01,010
Do you know a student
called Dokgo Se Ri?

844
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:04,050
Yes, I do.

845
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:07,220
She's a postgraduate student
who used to be my TA.

846
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,680
We got a letter
from a Dokgo Tak who claims...

847
00:54:10,550 --> 00:54:11,990
to be her father.

848
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:16,160
It says you seduced
a naive student...

849
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:18,390
and are gaslighting her.

850
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:20,600
It's quite vulgar.

00:54:24,170 --> 00:54:25,230

Are you making the delivery today?

856
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:49,360
I'm here instead because Kwang Sook
had other business.

If you don't have other plans,

858
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:54,960
how about a drink after work?

859

Well...

860
00:55:10,750 --> 00:55:14,650

to treat you to a meal.

to spend some time...

You didn't pick up earlier,
so I sent you a text.

What...

877
00:55:55,390 --> 00:55:56,520
How?

878
00:55:58,330 --> 00:55:59,360
I see.

879
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:03,330
Okay. That's fine.

880
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:05,830
Don't drink too much.

00:56:11,110 --> 00:56:12,170
Why...

883
00:56:12,610 --> 00:56:14,680
would he have a drink
with the chairman?

(Eagle Brewery Ma Kwang Sook)

886
00:56:40,170 --> 00:56:43,240
It's an important call.
I have to take it outside.

887
00:56:43,670 --> 00:56:44,710
Of course.

888
00:56:56,450 --> 00:56:58,250
It's surprising
that you're calling me.

889
00:56:58,250 --> 00:56:59,790
What's the occasion?

890
00:57:00,050 --> 00:57:04,030
Well... Why are you drinking
with my brother-in-law?

891
00:57:04,390 --> 00:57:06,090
I want to be friends with him,

892
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:08,800
so I asked him
to have a drink with me.

893

Why do you want
to be friends with him?

894

I told you.

895
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:16,910
You are struggling,
worried, and concerned.

896
00:57:17,170 --> 00:57:18,710
So I'll handle everything.

897
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:20,640
What?

898

Half of your worries are
about your brothers-in-law.

In order to take care of the issues,

900

I need to get to know
your brothers-in-law.

What are you talking about?

902
00:57:32,850 --> 00:57:35,120
My soju is getting lukewarm.

903
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:36,790
I should go.

Hello, Chairman Han...

905
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:46,430
What on earth is he thinking?

906
00:57:52,210 --> 00:57:55,740
How about we treat each other
like brothers?

907

Oh, dear. Well...

908
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:01,320
How dare I treat you like that?

909
00:58:03,550 --> 00:58:05,990
I grew up as an only child,

910
00:58:05,990 --> 00:58:08,960
so I've always envied people
with many siblings.

911
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:12,560
I think it would be reassuring
to have a brother like you.

00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:25,370
From what I've heard,

915
00:58:25,370 --> 00:58:27,810
it seems like
we didn't go to the same college.

916
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:30,450
Where did you serve in the military?

917
00:58:30,450 --> 00:58:32,750
I served in Cheorwon,
Gangwon Province.

918
00:58:34,050 --> 00:58:36,650
Did you serve
in the Artillery Brigade?

919
00:58:37,790 --> 00:58:38,920
Then...

920
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:41,190
You too?

921
00:58:41,890 --> 00:58:42,890
Galmal-eup.

922
00:58:42,890 --> 00:58:43,960
Naedae-ri.

923
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:50,930
Salute!

924
00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:53,770
Salute!

925
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:58,010
I had no idea.

926
00:58:58,710 --> 00:59:00,040
Have a seat.

927
00:59:01,710 --> 00:59:02,810
My goodness.

928
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:07,450
It's surprising
that you served on the front.

929
00:59:07,650 --> 00:59:10,450
My father didn't want his only son
to be a man with a weak mind,

930
00:59:10,450 --> 00:59:13,050
so he pulled some strings...

931
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:14,760
to send me to the toughest unit.

932
00:59:15,390 --> 00:59:17,360
I was a forward observer.

933
00:59:17,430 --> 00:59:19,730
As a forward observer,
I went around many mountains.

934
00:59:19,790 --> 00:59:21,360
I see.

935
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:22,730
My gosh. Anyway,

936
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:25,530
it's so nice to see someone
from the same military unit.

937
00:59:25,530 --> 00:59:26,600
Well...

938
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:28,870
Please drop the honorifics.

939
00:59:28,870 --> 00:59:30,510
You can talk down to me.

940
00:59:31,710 --> 00:59:32,870
Shall I?

941
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:34,480
Sure.

942
00:59:40,150 --> 00:59:43,080
(Ribs, duck meat)

943
00:59:43,450 --> 00:59:44,550
Get in the car.

944
00:59:44,550 --> 00:59:46,450
I'll give you a ride.

945
00:59:46,890 --> 00:59:48,760
It's okay. I'll take a taxi.

946
00:59:49,090 --> 00:59:50,560
When your superior
offers you a ride,

947
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:51,990
just do as you're told.

948
00:59:51,990 --> 00:59:53,060
Come on.

949
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:55,030
Thank you.

950
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:57,770
Thank you for the ride.

951
00:59:57,770 --> 00:59:59,700
My pleasure. Please get in the car.

952
01:00:14,950 --> 01:00:16,450
How was the business today?

953
01:00:17,450 --> 01:00:20,020
It wasn't bad for the first day.

954
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:22,960
You should be nice to Ms. Ji.

955
01:00:23,290 --> 01:00:25,130
You can't find a woman
like her elsewhere.

956
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:26,430
She's right.

957
01:00:26,430 --> 01:00:28,100
But you always draw a line...

958
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:31,370
saying she's the investor
and you're the shop owner.

959
01:00:31,370 --> 01:00:33,130
That's not so nice to hear.

960
01:00:33,870 --> 01:00:36,140
Of course, I'm very grateful.

961
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:38,910
But if I suddenly change
and act nice toward her,

962
01:00:39,270 --> 01:00:41,610
she will probably think
it's because of her money.

963
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,180
What does that mean?

964
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:47,450
So you do have feelings for Ok Bun.

965
01:00:52,450 --> 01:00:55,060
I don't know. Stop asking questions.

966
01:00:58,790 --> 01:01:00,030
Come on in.

967
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:02,630
I guess Chun Soo is home.

968
01:01:03,870 --> 01:01:05,200
- You're home, Chun Soo.
- Hey.

969
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:06,770
- We have a visitor.
- Visitor?

970
01:01:06,770 --> 01:01:07,770
What?

971
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:15,280
My goodness.

972
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:17,710
Oh, dear.

973
01:01:19,150 --> 01:01:22,550
I asked him to come in
and have some makgeolli.

974
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:25,120
I'm sorry
for coming so late at night.

975
01:01:30,990 --> 01:01:32,260
Who is he?

976
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:35,130
He's Chairman Han Dong Seok
of LX Hotel.

977
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:37,670
I'm glad you're here.

978
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:40,540
Now that you're here,
you should have some makgeolli.

979
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:42,540
Thank you.

980
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:44,610
Mr. Han.

981
01:01:44,610 --> 01:01:47,440
Please let me introduce my brothers.

982
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:50,580
This is Oh Heung Soo, the third.

983
01:01:51,010 --> 01:01:52,810
Nice to meet you.
I'm the third Eagle.

984
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:54,750
- Nice to meet you.
- And you.

985
01:01:56,050 --> 01:01:57,620
And this is the fourth Eagle.

986
01:01:58,320 --> 01:01:59,450
I'm Oh Beom Soo.

987
01:01:59,950 --> 01:02:01,020
Nice to meet you.

988
01:02:01,390 --> 01:02:02,660
Hello, sir.

989
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:05,460
The youngest Eagle, right?

990
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:06,560
Yes.

991
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:07,800
How's work treating you?

992
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:08,800
It's fun.

993
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:12,070
Why don't we have a seat and talk?

994
01:02:12,070 --> 01:02:13,870
Please sit.

995
01:02:13,870 --> 01:02:15,300
All right.

996
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:18,210
Chairman Han,
can I talk to you for a second?

997
01:02:25,110 --> 01:02:26,650
- Have a seat, Chun Soo.
- Okay.

998
01:02:29,180 --> 01:02:31,690
I had some makgeolli with him.

999
01:02:31,690 --> 01:02:33,150
I asked him to come in...

1000
01:02:33,150 --> 01:02:34,520
for some makgeolli.

1001
01:02:35,990 --> 01:02:38,430
What are you doing now?

1002
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:43,100
One of the reasons...

1003
01:02:43,100 --> 01:02:46,000
you're not going out with me...

1004
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:48,670
is because you're concerned
about your brothers-in-law.

1005
01:02:51,340 --> 01:02:52,410
Let me...

1006
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:55,280
take it from here.

1007
01:02:56,140 --> 01:02:57,150
What?

1008
01:02:57,250 --> 01:02:59,880
I'll be like a big brother...

1009
01:03:01,180 --> 01:03:02,620
to your brothers-in-law.

1010
01:03:49,530 --> 01:03:52,070
(For Eagle Brothers)

1011
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:54,740
Don't try to keep it
from me like that.

1012
01:03:54,740 --> 01:03:56,640
What is it that I don't know?

1013
01:03:56,740 --> 01:04:00,170
I heard you and Dad
used to work at Eagle Brewery.

1014
01:04:00,370 --> 01:04:02,610
Ms. Jang used to carry you around,
get you dressed, and put you to bed.

1015
01:04:02,610 --> 01:04:04,050
She adored you a lot.

1016
01:04:04,250 --> 01:04:06,310
She wasn't just
an employee of the brewery.

1017
01:04:06,310 --> 01:04:07,850
She was like your nanny.

1018
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:11,420
I'm only interested
in the woman I like.

1019
01:04:11,420 --> 01:04:13,960
I don't care
about anyone else at all.

1020
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:15,790
I must say my preference is clear.

1021
01:04:15,790 --> 01:04:17,930
Just stay where you are.

1022
01:04:17,930 --> 01:04:20,060
I'll sort things out around you...

1023
01:04:20,060 --> 01:04:22,260
and make you choose me.
