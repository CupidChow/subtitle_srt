00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:07,580
(Episode 34)

2
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,200
Good job, Se Ri.

3
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,540
You played great again today.

4
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,140
Thank you.

5
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,310
How are you so good...

6
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:10,510
at interpreting music
when it's not your major?

7
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,280
You flatter me.

8
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,610
Our guests love your music.

9
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:17,580
Could you stay and play for us?

10
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,650
I agreed to fill in
for my friend while she recovered...

11
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:22,190
from surgery.

12
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:23,890
Tomorrow will be my last day.

13
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,460
That's a shame. You did great.

14
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,770
Your first voicemail message.

15
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,210
Your mom just stopped by my office.

16
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,580
Her face looked a lot worse
than it did a few days ago.

17
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:48,180
You shouldn't be doing this
to your mom.

18
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,480
Call me
as soon as you get this message.

19
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,480
I'll be waiting.

20
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,030
(Gyeol)

21
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,010
Where on earth are you,
and what are you doing,

22
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:19,280
my darling puppy?

23
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,080
I'm dying over here.

24
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,090
How can you not even call me?

25
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,150
How could you?

26
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,800
She'll come back
once she runs out of money.

27
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,570
There's no need to cry.

28
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:47,740
Honey.

29
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,180
I hope nothing bad happened to her.

30
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,810
If anything bad happened,
we would've gotten a call.

31
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:55,780
No news is good news.

32
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,750
She is
such a nice and docile daughter.

33
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,950
I can't believe
she's breaking my heart like this.

34
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,020
I've never imagined...

35
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,760
Se Ri would do such a thing to me.

36
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:10,560
That brat Beom Soo
must be behind all this.

37
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,830
Otherwise,

38
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,970
Se Ri wouldn't be doing this to us.

39
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,550
Ha Ni. I will raise her.

40
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:36,150
Why did I never consider the fact...

41
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,960
that you could date someone?

42
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:40,360
We're in the same situation now.

43
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:43,230
I don't have to give up Ha Ni.

44
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:49,070
Can I come in?

45
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,270
Yes.

46
00:03:58,410 --> 00:03:59,510
These are Ha Ni's clothes.

47
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,810
I should've done it.

48
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,550
Thank you.

49
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:08,090
Oh, right.
Did Chun Soo tell you that?

50
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,090
Mr. Han offered me
the position of an outside director.

51
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,960
Yes. I heard.

52
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,700
I got a good opportunity
thanks to you.

53
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,530
For my career
and my financial situation,

54
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,130
it'll help me a lot.

55
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,770
I'm glad that it'll help you.

56
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,050
What is this?

57
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,480
I couldn't afford to throw
a birthday party for Ha Ni,

58
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,750
so I skipped it.

59
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:43,120
But I thought we should at least
take a birthday photo.

60
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,720
So we took one at a photo studio
a few days ago.

61
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,560
I should've taken care of it.

62
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,160
I'm sorry.

63
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,100
Please don't be.

64
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,300
You've been through a lot
because of the brewery.

65
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:55,970
How could you possibly
care about Ha Ni's birthday?

66
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,600
Don't worry about it.

67
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,710
- Gosh, it hurts!
- Oh, dear.

68
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:03,980
My gosh.

69
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,050
It hurts. Gosh, it's killing me.

70
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:15,490
Emergency.

71
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:17,560
Come to my room this instant.

72
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,620
We're having an emergency meeting.

73
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,930
- Is something wrong?
- An emergency meeting?

74
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,630
- Her first birthday party?
- Her first birthday party?

75
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,400
Her whole family is here for her,

76
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,870
so it makes no sense
that she can't even have...

77
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,500
her first birthday party.

78
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,310
It doesn't make sense.

79
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:36,170
So...

80
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:39,080
I'd like you guys to free up
some time tomorrow evening.

81
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:41,310
Let's throw...

82
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:43,610
a surprise party
without telling Beom Soo.

83
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,350
Okay. Let's do that.

84
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:52,220
(LX Hotel Chairman Han Dong Seok)

85
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,890
The emergency meeting is over.

86
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,960
- You're dismissed.
- All right.

87
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,500
Good night.

88
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,700
- Good night.
- Good night.

89
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:07,740
Hello?

90
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,510
I guess you're busy now.

91
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,810
I was having an emergency meeting
with my brothers-in-law.

92
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,850
Why? Is something wrong?

93
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,080
It's not that.

94
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,950
It was the first birthday...

95
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,590
of Beom Soo's daughter
a few days ago.

96
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,960
But we forgot about it.

97
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:28,330
So we'll get together
and have dinner tomorrow.

98
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,960
It's her first birthday party.

99
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:33,900
What? But you have
someplace to go with me tomorrow.

100
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,030
Where?

101
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,640
You'll see once you get there.

102
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,970
Can you give me some time
tomorrow morning?

103
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,250
Where are we going now?

104
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,820
After I realized...

105
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,390
my feelings for you,

106
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,600
I went to see my late wife
and told her about it first.

107
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,930
I believed...

108
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:12,040
that she would wish
for my happiness.

109
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:17,410
And I think your late husband...

110
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,010
would feel the same way.

111
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,380
I believe...

112
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:29,450
they want us to be happy
more than anyone else in the world.

113
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,390
What do you think, Kwang Sook?

114
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:37,760
I...

115
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,900
think so too.

116
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:46,240
Let's pay them a visit together...

117
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:48,870
so they won't worry about us.

118
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:52,710
That way, we'll be able
to take a load off our mind...

119
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:55,450
and focus more on each other.

120
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:12,730
(The late Kang Min Seo)

121
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,300
Have you been well?

122
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:22,970
Today,

123
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:27,080
there's someone
I want to introduce to you.

124
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:28,910
So I came with her.

125
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,220
She's the one I told you about.

126
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,690
She's Ma Kwang Sook.

127
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:51,670
Hello.

128
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,370
I'm...

129
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:57,840
lacking in many ways,

130
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,980
but I'll try my best
to become the person...

131
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:04,950
that Dong Seok needs.

132
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,120
Please watch over us.

133
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,960
How does it feel
when you see her in person?

134
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:22,300
You're relieved, aren't you?

135
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,000
Now,

136
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,310
you can stop worrying about me.

137
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,140
Rest in peace.

138
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:46,190
(The late Oh Jang Soo)

139
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,460
I'm Han Dong Seok.

140
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,900
Kwang Sook told me...

141
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,970
how you had always worked hard...

142
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,270
to take care of your brothers...

143
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,370
as the eldest son.

144
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,240
Now,

145
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:12,050
I'd like to take on the work...

146
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,490
and put in my effort on your behalf.

147
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:16,950
(The late Oh Jang Soo)

148
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,720
I'll make sure not to neglect...

149
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:23,060
taking care of Kwang Sook
and your brothers.

150
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,460
Please watch over us.

151
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:31,440
I hope you can rest in peace.

152
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:01,370
(Sarang Hall)

153
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,400
How are you feeling?

154
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:05,140
Are you feeling better?

155
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:08,940
Yes.

156
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,040
A lot better.

157
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:18,380
I must say, our paths crossed
in the most mysterious way.

158
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:24,960
We both have...

159
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,060
our late spouses resting here.

160
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:33,700
And this is the very place
where you fell...

161
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:35,800
into my arms.

162
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:41,570
What... My goodness.

163
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:44,440
Are you all right?

164
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:47,380
Now that I think about it,

165
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:49,750
our fates...

166
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:53,550
must've been connected
from the beginning.

167
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:58,120
So...

168
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:01,390
let's be a little more confident.

169
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:04,530
So let's stop hiding, okay?

170
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:09,930
Yes. I'll do that.

171
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,370
You should be
with your family tonight, right?

172
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,170
Let's hurry and go back.

173
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:17,210
Okay.

174
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,100
(PM shift part-timer wanted)

175
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:48,870
Mi Sun.

176
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,470
Hey, you're here.

177
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,110
Your part-timer's quitting?

178
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:55,550
She found a full-time job,

179
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,250
so this is her last week.

180
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:01,050
It's really hard
to find part-timers these days.

181
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,790
If you can't find anyone,

182
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,190
I'll come and help out...

183
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:07,360
after my shift at the brewery,
so don't worry.

184
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:08,960
Thanks.

185
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,330
What's the occasion?

186
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:13,300
Silly me. I forgot.

187
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,670
Come over for dinner later.

188
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,770
Why? Is it a special day?

189
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:20,910
We'll celebrate
Ha Ni's first birthday today.

190
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,070
I see.

191
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,140
Am I...

192
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,250
allowed to attend a family event?

193
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,710
Of course, you are.

194
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:32,150
You're practically family now.

195
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,560
What?

196
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,260
Did I do something wrong again?

197
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:44,900
Don't you dare
try to turn that into a proposal.

198
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,130
Do you get that?

199
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:49,200
Goodness.

200
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:51,740
Okay.

201
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,100
I'll sort out an official proposal.

202
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,310
Bear with me.

203
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:58,510
I was just kidding.

204
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,840
I have to get back.

205
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,980
See you.

206
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,380
Mi Sun.

207
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,450
I'm getting really forgetful.

208
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,020
Where did I put it?

209
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,290
Here it is.

210
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:27,940
Keep doing that,
and you'll get called a boomer.

211
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,610
You can't do these things.

212
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:35,510
Heung Soo.

213
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,310
Are you free this evening?

214
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,220
Why?

215
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,720
It's Ha Ni's first birthday.

216
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:42,790
Kwang Sook invited you too.

217
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,260
Your younger brother is celebrating
his daughter's first birthday.

218
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:50,160
When will you marry...

219
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,500
and start a family?

220
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,300
How can I do that...

221
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,930
when I can barely fend for myself?

222
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,470
My gosh.

223
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,140
Doctor Baek.

224
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:08,280
What brings you here?

225
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,950
I need a haircut.

226
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,150
You're with another client.

227
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:20,460
He's not a client.
You don't have to mind him.

228
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,130
Come this way.

229
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,370
Get back to your store.

230
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:38,140
I'll stay for a short break.

231
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,610
Don't mind me and get to work.

232
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,420
What style would you like?

233
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,620
Do whatever you think will work.

234
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:56,460
You're so easygoing.

235
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,660
Then...

236
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,500
I'll give you the newest haircut...

237
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,400
and make you look good.

238
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,870
Why is she talking like that?

239
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:11,110
I had some free time this morning,

240
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:13,710
so I took Gureum out for a walk.

241
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:16,480
How sweet of you.

242
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:20,950
To think someone as cool as you
took them out for a walk.

243
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:25,090
I bet Gureum had a great time.

244
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:28,130
Isn't she going overboard
with the praise?

245
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:30,230
Gureum didn't want to walk at first,

246
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,860
but then they started to sniff,

247
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,360
and that got them going.

248
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,170
Next time,

249
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,970
would you like to join...

250
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,110
Gureum and me for a walk?

251
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:49,510
I'd love to.

252
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:56,520
That punk is hitting on her
in the open.

253
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,340
I heard you and Dad...

254
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,740
used to work at Eagle Brewery.

255
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:17,540
Don't try to keep it
from me like that.

256
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,880
What is it that I don't know?

257
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,280
For my kids' sake,
I shouldn't have done wrong things.

258
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:30,950
This is all on me.

259
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:36,390
What's that noise?

260
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,710
What are you doing?

261
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:56,280
I'm making rice porridge.

262
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,520
You've barely eaten
since Se Ri left home.

263
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,090
You could get really ill.

264
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,660
It's almost done. Sit down.

265
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,560
It's hot. Let it cool down a bit
before you eat.

266
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,410
What's the occasion?

267
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,910
Why would you make me porridge?

268
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:27,480
I still can't believe
our daughter ran away from home.

269
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:30,250
If my wife were to fall ill too,

270
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,620
I'd never survive that.

271
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,090
I don't feel like eating.

272
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:36,950
You need to eat anyway.

273
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:53,540
Why the heck are you crying
at the table?

274
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:57,770
Honey.

275
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:00,980
Shall we just...

276
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,210
let Se Ri have her way?

277
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,150
What are you saying?

278
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:09,290
That's better than cutting ties
with her.

279
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:12,220
She loves him.

280
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:14,560
She doesn't want anyone
but Beom Soo.

281
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,160
Have you lost your mind...

282
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,560
because you didn't eat
for a few days?

283
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,900
We tried hard enough
to talk her out of it.

284
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,670
And she still says she loves him.

285
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:25,800
I'd rather disown her...

286
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,240
than let her marry Beom Soo.

287
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,380
You want us and them
to become in-laws?

288
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,250
Say that once more,

289
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,380
and you'll end up a widow!

290
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,290
You know,

291
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:46,660
you might lose me before I lose you.

292
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:52,200
I can't live without Se Ri!

293
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,640
Se Ri...

294
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,330
Se Ri.

295
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:25,900
Gyeol.

296
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,740
What are you doing here?

297
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:39,010
I met this friend
at my piano academy.

298
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,980
She plays live at a nearby bar.

299
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:45,150
She posted on social media...

300
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:47,950
that she needed someone
to fill in for her for a while.

301
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,120
I read that
and decided to come over.

302
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:53,620
Are you staying
at your friend's place?

303
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,460
Yes.

304
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,260
Don't tell anyone else
that I'm here.

305
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:03,300
Okay.

306
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,570
I didn't think it was you...

307
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,340
when I saw you earlier.

308
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,480
I almost jump
whenever I look in the mirror.

309
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,620
My mom liked my long hair,

310
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,950
so it always came down to my waist.

311
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,190
I wanted to get a degree in piano,

312
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,290
but I chose business
because Mom disapproved.

313
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:37,530
I realized I wasn't living my life
for myself.

314
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,200
I had been living it for my mom.

315
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:44,740
Did you leave home
just to revolt against your mother?

316
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,310
That's not all it is.

317
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:54,120
I wanted to face myself...

318
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:57,050
in a place where no one knew me.

319
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,190
What I really want in life...

320
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:04,390
and who I really love.

321
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:08,570
I desperately needed
to figure that out.

322
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:15,470
Okay, looking good.

323
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:17,210
Look chic.

324
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,880
That's it. Okay.

325
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:22,150
Okay, I love what I'm seeing.
Hold that.

326
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,820
Okay. Just like that.

327
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:29,850
Lieutenant Oh.

328
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:32,190
Can I have your brother's number?

329
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,290
I need to talk to him about Se Ri.

330
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:39,560
This time, look tighter.
Like you're close.

331
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,900
I don't mind them
looking professional,

332
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:47,240
but I'd prefer
a younger, fresher vibe.

333
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:49,510
It could be better.

334
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:52,810
That's not easy to get
from professional models.

335
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:54,540
For that,
you'd need rookie models...

336
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:56,080
or just everyday people.

337
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,990
What about our new recruits?

338
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:04,220
Our new recruits?

339
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:20,070
Try to relax.

340
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:22,370
This is too awkward for me.

341
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:24,640
Same here.

342
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,350
Let's take a few test shots
to get a feel for the vibe.

343
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:29,410
Here we go.

344
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,020
Try laughing this time.

345
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:37,250
Just think that you're taking photos
with a friend.

346
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:41,360
Think that you're here to have fun
and relax.

347
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:42,560
- Sure.
- Right.

348
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:47,060
Looking good. This is great.

349
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:51,030
This is great. I love it.

350
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:53,700
Try to look more like friends.

351
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:56,870
That's the one. This is nice.

352
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:58,880
These look good.

353
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:05,750
That's it.

354
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:31,580
I didn't think it was right to talk
over the phone,

355
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,680
so I asked to meet in person.

356
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,180
I met Se Ri last night.

357
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:43,220
Ever since we were kids,
we've been like siblings.

358
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:45,020
Given the situation,

359
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:48,390
I thought she might feel more
at ease talking to me.

360
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:50,390
That's why I called her.

361
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:54,030
Thankfully, I managed to reach her.

362
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,730
I see.

363
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,370
Se Ri grew up playing the piano.

364
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:03,370
She's staying with a friend
who went to the same piano academy.

365
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:07,080
Her friend had something come up,
so Se Ri's filling in for her.

366
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:10,750
You'll be able to meet her
at that bar.

367
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:26,500
No way. It smells amazing in here.

368
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,670
It's like we're actually preparing
for a feast.

369
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,740
Could you taste this for me?

370
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,410
Gosh, no way. It's so good.

371
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,480
I'm glad it's to your liking.

372
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,950
It's amazing.
Mi Sun, you're the best.

373
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:52,290
Ok Bun, the meatballs are burning.

374
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:54,560
- Oh, no.
- Goodness.

375
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:01,430
Oh, no. They're black on one side.

376
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,630
The griddle
should've been managed better.

377
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:05,670
What a waste of food.

378
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,710
I left them a little charred...

379
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:10,740
to add some smokiness.

380
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,380
Meatballs aren't
like stir-fried pork.

381
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,740
They're not supposed to be smoky.

382
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,090
Hold on.
Did you also make seaweed soup?

383
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:30,860
Who made this?

384
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:33,630
I did.

385
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:35,730
Goodness.

386
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:40,200
My gosh, it's seasoned perfectly.

387
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,640
How is it this good?

388
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,210
No way.

389
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,910
Did you make braised ribs
and bulgogi too?

390
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:51,150
Yes, I gave it a try
since I had some time on my hands.

391
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:54,220
Goodness. Mi Sun,
did you take cooking classes?

392
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:55,890
Gosh, no.

393
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,220
I was busy at the brewery...

394
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:00,620
and wondered if I should order in.

395
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:03,130
You took a load off my shoulders,
Mi Sun.

396
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,360
Thank you.

397
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,530
This really looks good.

398
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,980
Have you finished
cooking the meatballs?

399
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:23,110
No.

400
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,450
I wasn't in the mood,
so I gave up halfway.

401
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:28,820
Why weren't you in the mood?

402
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,720
It's Mi Sun.

403
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,930
She kept calling me out on it.

404
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:38,230
Mi Sun called you out?

405
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:40,930
I was adding smokiness
to the meatballs,

406
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,200
but she said I had burned them.

407
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:47,770
What do you mean
Mi Sun called you out?

408
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,740
She's too kind
to do something like that.

409
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,540
The rice cakes have been delivered!

410
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,880
- Are they here?
- Yes.

411
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,180
- Are they here?
- That's right.

412
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:57,580
- Goodness.
- My gosh.

413
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,150
The rice cakes turned out amazing.

414
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:01,280
Please try one.

415
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:04,490
- No way.
- Goodness.

416
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:05,960
So that's how they make them
these days.

417
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:13,230
- It's really good.
- Right?

418
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:14,260
Yes.

419
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:18,640
Mi Sun, try one.

420
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,270
- Sure.
- Here.

421
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,440
- Is it good?
- It's good, isn't it?

422
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,440
Yes.

423
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,560
It melts in the mouth.

424
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:54,770
Hey.

425
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:57,870
Do you have to be that greedy
about food?

426
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:00,680
Have one at a time.
Don't stuff your face like that.

427
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,480
Unbelievable.

428
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:11,960
Go to her.

429
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,390
- What?
- Hurry.

430
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:15,430
What?

431
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:18,930
Seriously.

432
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,860
I can't believe him.

433
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,300
- It's tasty.
- Didn't they turn out great?

434
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,270
- Try one too.
- I'm good.

435
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,440
(LX Hotel Chairman Han Dong Seok)

436
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:40,320
Yes, hello?

437
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,590
How are things coming along
for the birthday party?

438
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:47,020
It's going well.
We just picked up the rice cakes,

439
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:48,790
and we're almost done cooking.

440
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:51,790
We just have to set the table
in a little bit.

441
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,830
Rice cakes
for a first birthday party?

442
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:57,130
Did you get something
like baekseolgi or susupattteok?

443
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:59,100
Yes, that's right.

444
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:00,840
That sounds delicious.

445
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:04,210
I haven't even had lunch yet.

446
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:07,780
Why haven't you been able to eat?

447
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,510
Our housekeeper
went to visit her daughter,

448
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:12,020
and my kids aren't home.

449
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:16,150
You could've ordered something in.

450
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:19,120
I didn't feel like eating
since I knew I'd be eating alone.

451
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:06,170
(Eagle Brewery)

452
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:22,050
(Eagle Brewery)

453
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,530
Where are you off to,
looking sharp in that suit?

454
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:35,530
My blind date asked me out
on a second date.

455
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:37,870
I'm on my way to meet her.

456
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:40,000
Don't you know about
Ha Ni's birthday party?

457
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,840
- I know.
- And?

458
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:43,540
You're going on a date...

459
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:45,240
instead of coming to the party?

460
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:49,780
The plan was made in advance,
so I can't just cancel it.

461
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:52,250
I guess you like your date a lot.

462
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:54,420
Come on. We went on only one date,
so it's too soon to tell.

463
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,220
I should see her a few more times.

464
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:57,620
I'll get going, then.

465
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,700
See her a few more times?

466
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:13,100
It seems like he's fallen for her.

467
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:14,900
Darn it.

468
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,240
(Eagle Brewery)

469
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,580
Why did you come here
without calling me?

470
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,520
You said you hadn't eaten yet,

471
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:28,150
so I brought rice cakes and food
from Ha Ni's birthday party.

472
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:31,150
I hope you'll enjoy it.

473
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:33,620
Wait.

474
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:37,660
What's the rush?

475
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:39,130
Come in and have some tea
before you leave.

476
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:42,300
I should go and prepare
for the birthday party.

477
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:43,830
Just come in for a bit.

478
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:46,400
If you leave just like this,
I'll be sad.

479
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:50,470
No one's home,
so you don't have to worry.

480
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:51,640
Come in.

481
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:53,010
All right.

482
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,620
My goodness.

483
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:04,450
What a sumptuous feast.

484
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:08,290
Did you really cook all these?

485
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:12,560
I told you. I'm a terrible cook.

486
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:15,930
Chun Soo's girlfriend
cooks really well,

487
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:17,570
so she made most of them.

488
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:20,340
Does Vice-CEO Oh Chun Soo
have a girlfriend?

489
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,370
Yes.

490
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:24,440
I think they'll get married soon.

491
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:25,740
My goodness.

492
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,510
There's a right order to everything.

493
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,750
Don't you think
we should get married first?

494
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:35,280
Well... Why would you say that?

495
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,090
Enjoy your food anyway.

496
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:40,390
Wait. Where are you going?

497
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,030
I told you. I should go
and prepare for the birthday party.

498
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,800
What's all the rush?

499
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,430
Stay with me while I eat.

500
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:48,560
Sit.

501
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:51,270
Then...

502
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,570
I'll stay until you finish eating.

503
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:56,770
Go ahead and eat.

504
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,510
All right.

505
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:13,220
You're such a handful.

506
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,940
How is it? Do you like it?

507
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:28,140
My gosh.

508
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,940
It's great.

509
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,180
Make sure to chew it well.

510
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:39,120
You didn't even have lunch.

511
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,850
You must've been so hungry.

512
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:45,760
Thank you.

513
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:50,830
You got me this lunch box
when I was hungry.

514
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:54,800
I'm so happy
that I have a great girlfriend.

515
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,670
I'm home.

516
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:01,470
My goodness. Someone is here.

517
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,340
I guess that's my son.

518
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:08,040
What... Why are you going in there?

519
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,350
I have to hide.

520
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,250
This is my house.

521
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:14,080
You don't have to hide. My gosh.

522
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,220
Are you in the kitchen?

523
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:18,120
I didn't know you had a visitor.

524
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:23,290
This is the person I'm seeing now.

525
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:24,390
Say hello to her.

526
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,360
This is my son.

527
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,100
What?

528
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,730
Hello. Nice to meet you.

I'm Ma Kwang Sook.

532
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,480
Now that your son is here,
I should get going.

533
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,910
Please stay.

534
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:47,050
No. I was actually going to leave.

535
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:48,120
I'll see you later.

536
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,250
Wait...

Oh, dear.

539

Wait, CEO Ma.

00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,680
I mean, Kwang Sook.

543
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:20,880
I should get going. I'll call you.

00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,040
Did she leave?

547
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:47,380
What? Yes.

548
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:49,650
Why did she leave in such a hurry?

549
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,350
I have no idea.

550
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,850
It was her first time here,
so I guess she was nervous.

551
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,790
I shouldn't have come home so early.

552
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,920
No, it's not like that.

553
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,290
So, what do you think?

554
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,060
She's unbelievably beautiful.

555
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,930
Are you just exaggerating
to make me feel good?

556
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:12,400
No. I'm not exaggerating.

557
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:14,440
Thanks.

558
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:13,700
Where's the copy machine?

559
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,030
Please get it running.

560
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:16,700
Me?

561
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:19,040
I'm sorry.

562
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,300
I'll teach Financial Accounting
this semester. I'm Oh Beom Soo.

563
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,140
I had no one to babysit her,
so I had to bring her.

564
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:25,470
I'll do it.

565
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,480
Thank you for today, Se Ri.

566
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:43,130
I like you.

567
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:47,060
Is having feelings for you
really such a terrible thing?

568
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:58,070
How dare you go after my daughter?

569
00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:01,010
I bet you approached my daughter
on purpose.

570
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:02,010
- Didn't you?
- Enough!

571
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:08,080
But you don't have
to worry about me anymore.

572
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:11,350
From now on, I'm going to be brave.

573
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,750
You should go home with me.

574
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,520
I'll drive you.

575
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:19,490
No. I'm not going home.

576
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:22,590
You're playing the piano
just to fill in for your friend.

577
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:25,630
You can't stay
at your friend's place forever.

578
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,100
You should confront the problem
and fix it.

579
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,130
What you're doing now
is escaping from reality.

580
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,100
Let's go back to Seoul.

581
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:39,580
Are you just here to take me home,

582
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,080
not because you were
worried about me?

583
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,480
Then you should go back.

584
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:55,490
I came because I was worried.

585
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:02,730
After I heard about you from Gyeol,
I came running right away.

586
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:08,600
For the past ten days,

587
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:10,740
I've only been worried about you.

588
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,480
I didn't even care about the school
or the department.

589
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:20,320
All I could think of was you.

590
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,520
Are you happy now?

591
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:26,820
Professor.

592
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:30,890
To be honest,

593
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,330
I'm embarrassed and confused
by how I'm feeling now.

594
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,470
Being a professor doesn't mean
I have the answers to everything.

595
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,910
I'm not asking for
a reply right away.

596
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:53,650
I just...

597
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:56,420
don't want you to push me away.

598
00:41:57,550 --> 00:41:58,550
Okay?

599
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:36,930
Hello?

600
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:38,160
It's me.

601
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:40,730
I just met Se Ri.

602
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,400
You met Se Ri?

603
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:45,900
Where is she?

604
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:51,010
Okay.

605
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:52,980
Drive back safely.

606
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:55,040
Thank you.

607
00:42:58,850 --> 00:43:01,320
Thank you so much, Professor Oh.

608
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:10,860
Thank you.

609
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:26,480
Why did you call my mom
without asking me first?

610
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:28,180
I promised...

611
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,710
I'd call her
if I got in touch with you.

612
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,220
Let me out.

613
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:35,280
Se Ri.

614
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:38,390
I wouldn't have left home
just to go back like this.

615
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:41,690
I can't go back home like this.

616
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:45,560
Sorry.

617
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,060
Heung Soo.

618
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:49,800
Where are you?

619
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,430
I'm driving back
from Yeongjongdo Island.

620
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:52,670
When will you be back?

621
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:54,740
Why? Is something wrong?

622
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:56,570
(First Birthday)

623
00:43:56,570 --> 00:43:59,710
We're throwing a surprise party
for Ha Ni's first birthday.

624
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:01,140
What?

625
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:06,120
Ms. Gong, Kwang Sook, Mi Sun,
and Ok Bun...

626
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:08,150
all got together to cook.

627
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:09,520
Get here fast, okay?

628
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,790
Okay. See you.

629
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,090
Is it Ha Ni's first birthday?

630
00:44:20,330 --> 00:44:21,400
Apparently.

631
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:22,830
Take me with you.

632
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,030
What?

633
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,400
It's
Ha Ni's first ever birthday party.

634
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:29,870
I want to celebrate it with her.

635
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:31,540
But...

636
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:34,140
Please?

637
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:37,850
(Live brightly, have a broad mind,
and have big hopes.)

638
00:44:37,850 --> 00:44:39,920
(First Birthday)

639
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,450
Here we go.

640
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:43,690
Put that on the small table.

641
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:45,420
- Here?
- Yes, one by one.

642
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:47,360
- I can put that there.
- Yes.

643
00:44:48,790 --> 00:44:50,930
(First Birthday)

644
00:44:50,930 --> 00:44:52,800
(The Thousand Character Classic)

645
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:56,100
Are they set out?

646
00:44:56,570 --> 00:44:57,570
Good.

647
00:44:58,570 --> 00:44:59,640
We're done.

648
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,540
- Do you have everything?
- Yes.

649
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:04,070
Kang Soo.
Call Beom Soo and ask where he is.

650
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:05,410
Okay.

651
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:07,040
I'm home.

652
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:08,910
He's here.

653
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:14,480
Surprise!

654
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:16,090
Thank you.

655
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:17,150
Congratulations.

656
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:19,890
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

657
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,190
Congratulations.

658
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:26,060
I brought someone with me.

659
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:27,700
What?

660
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:33,540
You can come in.

661
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:35,840
(First Birthday)

662
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:43,180
Hello.

663
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:44,210
Hi.

664
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:47,080
Goodness. Se Ri.

665
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,920
What happened?

666
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:57,260
Come on over here.

667
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,070
I heard about the birthday party...

668
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:06,140
and begged Professor Oh
to let me join.

669
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:10,840
Ha Ni likes Se Ri a lot.

670
00:46:16,410 --> 00:46:17,650
- Heung Soo.
- What?

671
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:19,750
Who is she?

672
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:21,080
Her?

673
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:24,390
She's Ha Ni's future stepmom.

674
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:27,860
Okay, then...

675
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:30,330
she ranks below me?

676
00:46:31,790 --> 00:46:35,160
Let's begin the celebrations...

677
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,370
for Oh Ha Ni's first birthday party.

678
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:40,900
Please welcome
the birthday girl Oh Ha Ni.

679
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:47,340
My gosh. Look at that.

680
00:46:50,450 --> 00:46:53,020
- She's adorable.
- Goodness.

681
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:55,820
Just so you know,
Ha Ni's new ride...

682
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:58,320
is a generous gift from Kwang Sook.

683
00:46:58,320 --> 00:46:59,690
Good for you.

684
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:02,420
Look at her.

685
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:07,660
You look great. Applause.

686
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,230
Ha Ni.

687
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:14,400
I'm here too.

688
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:36,890
It's the highlight of the evening,

689
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:39,160
the Doljabi event.

690
00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:42,500
What the child grabs...

691
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:45,070
is said to decide
their future career.

692
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:47,240
I can't wait to find out...

693
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:49,170
what Oh Ha Ni will pick.

694
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,470
Will you all count down with me?

695
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:54,780
- Three, two, one.
- Two, one.

696
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:57,710
Oh Ha Ni, get grabbing!

697
00:47:57,710 --> 00:47:59,480
Drumroll...

698
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:01,480
The stethoscope?

699
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:02,920
- Oh, dear.
- Oh, no.

700
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:05,290
What item will Ha Ni choose?

701
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:09,460
The mic!
She picked up the microphone.

702
00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:12,430
Ha Ni chose the microphone.

703
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:14,130
Give her some applause.

704
00:48:15,330 --> 00:48:18,730
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you

705
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:22,200
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you

706
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:26,170
- Happy birthday, dear Ha Ni
- Happy birthday, dear Ha Ni

707
00:48:26,210 --> 00:48:29,110
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you

708
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:30,780
Blow out the candle.

709
00:48:32,350 --> 00:48:34,380
Ok Bun, squeeze in a bit more.

710
00:48:34,450 --> 00:48:36,020
Are you all ready?

711
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,890
Hurry. Get over here.

712
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:48,460
(Live brightly, have a broad mind,
and have big hopes.)

713
00:48:58,210 --> 00:48:59,780
Se Ri's being too stubborn.

714
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:02,840
I'll take her to my place
and talk to her over there.

715
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:09,650
Beom Soo.

716
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:13,760
What were you thinking
when you brought her here?

717
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,290
I had no choice
because she wanted...

718
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:19,700
to celebrate Ha Ni's birthday.

719
00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:22,560
Shouldn't you call her mother?

720
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,370
I already did.

721
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,540
Be honest.

722
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:31,840
You like her, don't you?

723
00:49:37,410 --> 00:49:40,220
Hey. Look at you, unable to answer.

724
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:43,990
If the levelheaded you can't say,
we know what the answer is.

725
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:46,760
Chun Soo.
I doubt they can break up easily.

726
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,060
Is that it, Beom Soo?

727
00:49:50,990 --> 00:49:53,800
I'm still thinking about it,
so don't push me.

728
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:00,900
What a disaster.

729
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,370
It's pretty serious.

730
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:07,910
Goodness.

731
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:12,780
Where did the other young lady go?

732
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:15,320
She's in Beom Soo's room
to put Ha Ni to bed.

733
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:17,690
I noticed...

734
00:50:17,850 --> 00:50:20,560
how Ha Ni looked at her
like she was her mom.

735
00:50:20,890 --> 00:50:22,120
Yes.

736
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:24,730
They both like each other so much.

737
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:28,060
That young lady...

738
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,700
looks calm and quiet,

739
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:33,400
but she must be
really strong-willed.

740
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:35,570
She left home
because her parents disapproved...

741
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:37,110
of her relationship.

742
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:40,810
Her parents are a piece of work.

743
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:44,310
Parents always give in
to their kids.

744
00:50:44,310 --> 00:50:46,280
I'm sure they'll come around.

745
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:50,350
Actually, it's not that simple.

746
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:53,860
They're not just
overprotective parents.

747
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:55,960
They're the worst.

748
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:58,530
The worst?

749
00:50:58,530 --> 00:51:00,330
You see,

750
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:03,530
her mom used to do...

751
00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:05,870
the books for the brewery.

752
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,140
And her dad was the brewery manager.

753
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:11,270
About 30 years ago, they colluded...

754
00:51:11,270 --> 00:51:13,880
to embezzle from the brewery
and took off.

755
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:15,580
Goodness.

756
00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:18,750
And recently, their company
made a fake video about our brewery,

757
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:21,050
saying we were brewing...

758
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:23,820
with stale rice riddled
with insects.

759
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:26,990
Wait. Is she the daughter
of Silla Brewery's CEO?

760
00:51:27,090 --> 00:51:28,390
That's right.

761
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:30,290
She's basically
this family's sworn enemy.

762
00:51:32,430 --> 00:51:35,300
This is the tale
of Romeo and Juliet.

763
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:37,070
That's the one.

764
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:44,810
Se Ri,
what are you doing over there?

765
00:51:45,210 --> 00:51:46,580
Join us for some tea.

766
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:54,180
Goodness.

767
00:51:56,490 --> 00:51:58,420
How long have you been
standing there?

768
00:51:59,050 --> 00:52:00,420
Is that true?

769
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:03,730
What... What do you mean?

770
00:52:04,990 --> 00:52:06,560
Did my mom and dad...

771
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,400
really embezzle from this brewery?

772
00:52:16,170 --> 00:52:17,240
Mom!

773
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:18,570
Well...

774
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:22,880
That's what you said just now.

775
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:25,410
I didn't know you were there.

776
00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:29,180
I'm sorry.
Please forget I said anything.

777
00:52:31,150 --> 00:52:32,250
Is anyone home?

778
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:43,470
May I come in?

779
00:52:44,330 --> 00:52:46,130
I heard that my daughter was here.

780
00:52:49,170 --> 00:52:50,240
Goodness.

781
00:52:54,510 --> 00:52:55,610
Se Ri.

782
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:01,420
You and Dad.

783
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:04,550
Did you embezzle
from this family's brewery?

784
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:08,360
What?

785
00:53:12,090 --> 00:53:14,000
How could you do that?

786
00:53:15,130 --> 00:53:16,160
Se Ri.

787
00:53:16,870 --> 00:53:18,530
Just hear me out. That was...

788
00:53:18,530 --> 00:53:20,170
You stole from them.

789
00:53:20,170 --> 00:53:22,300
Then you should've apologized
and begged for forgiveness.

790
00:53:22,470 --> 00:53:24,910
How could you keep lying
without shame?

791
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:29,210
And what's this about a fake video?

792
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:32,910
Se Ri.

793
00:53:33,050 --> 00:53:35,280
Why did you do such a thing?

794
00:53:38,290 --> 00:53:39,790
I never imagined...

795
00:53:40,090 --> 00:53:42,760
that my own parents
could be like that.

796
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:46,560
You're the worst.

797
00:53:49,030 --> 00:53:51,070
Se Ri!

798
00:53:57,740 --> 00:53:59,040
Are you all right?

799
00:54:13,190 --> 00:54:14,220
Se Ri.

800
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:16,090
Se Ri.

801
00:54:18,390 --> 00:54:19,530
Try to calm down, Se Ri.

802
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,330
Take a deep breath, and let's talk.

803
00:54:23,630 --> 00:54:26,230
I would've never imagined
that my parents...

804
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:27,870
would do such a thing.

805
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:33,340
I'm sorry.

806
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:37,810
I apologize on behalf of my parents.

807
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:41,080
This isn't something
you should apologize for.

808
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:45,020
Your parents did this...

809
00:54:45,050 --> 00:54:46,920
long before you were born.

810
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:48,990
It has nothing to do with you.

811
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:52,990
I now understand
why you kept your distance...

812
00:54:53,830 --> 00:54:55,060
from me.

813
00:54:56,530 --> 00:54:59,370
You probably thought
I had no shame...

814
00:55:00,070 --> 00:55:02,570
for telling you
I had feelings for you.

815
00:55:06,910 --> 00:55:08,380
I never once thought that.

816
00:55:10,050 --> 00:55:11,810
You didn't do anything wrong,

817
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:13,620
so don't beat yourself up about it.

818
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:54,220
I'm sorry for causing a commotion.

819
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:57,030
Don't worry too much
about your daughter.

820
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:00,560
We'll try to talk to her
so she understands.

821
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,370
Ever since the day
Se Ri's dad and I left...

822
00:56:11,370 --> 00:56:13,140
after embezzling money
from this brewery,

823
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:15,540
I haven't been able
to sleep peacefully at night.

824
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:18,280
The anxiety ate away at me.

825
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:20,350
For what you did,

826
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:23,820
you deserve every bit of it.

827
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:31,160
I promised myself...

828
00:56:31,890 --> 00:56:33,430
that when the time came,

829
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:34,900
I'd make up for what we did,
10 or 20 times more.

830
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:37,830
I still feel the same way.

831
00:56:39,470 --> 00:56:40,670
Says the person...

832
00:56:41,270 --> 00:56:42,800
whose husband made a fake video
about our brewery...

833
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,610
to report to the media.

834
00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:46,670
That...

835
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:55,050
I can make no excuse for that.

836
00:56:56,650 --> 00:56:57,690
I'm sorry.

837
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:04,090
It's late, and you should go.

838
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:07,160
Right.

839
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:23,240
Let me take you home.

840
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:39,730
I can sleep in my mom's room,

841
00:57:39,730 --> 00:57:41,460
so make yourself at home.

842
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:44,430
I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

843
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,800
It's not an inconvenience at all.

844
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:49,670
Think of it as your room
and sleep tight, okay?

845
00:57:50,370 --> 00:57:51,510
Thank you.

846
00:57:53,210 --> 00:57:54,210
Also,

847
00:57:55,010 --> 00:57:56,040
I'm sorry.

848
00:57:56,610 --> 00:57:57,950
My parents...

849
00:57:57,950 --> 00:57:58,980
I suggest...

850
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:04,420
you quiet all the screaming
in your head and get some sleep.

851
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:07,860
Got it?

852
00:58:08,890 --> 00:58:09,920
Sure.

853
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:16,000
Good night.

854
00:58:55,670 --> 00:58:56,670
Hello?

855
00:58:57,770 --> 00:59:00,010
I hope I didn't wake you up.

856
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:02,680
I was too angry to sleep.

857
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:05,180
What was that about earlier?

858
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:08,150
By taking off in a hurry like that,

859
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:11,250
you embarrassed me
in front of my son.

860
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:13,590
Tell me about it.

861
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:17,290
I ran off in a hurry
because I was flustered.

862
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:20,130
But on my way home,

863
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:23,330
I realized
I wasn't considerate to you.

864
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:26,030
I understand...

865
00:59:26,030 --> 00:59:28,170
why you want to hide this
from your brothers-in-law,

866
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:31,340
but you don't have to be like that
with my children.

867
00:59:31,710 --> 00:59:33,680
What we're doing isn't wrong.

868
00:59:34,410 --> 00:59:35,480
I'm sorry.

869
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:37,850
It won't happen again.

870
00:59:39,850 --> 00:59:41,980
Please don't be upset. Come on.

871
00:59:44,290 --> 00:59:46,690
Are you free tomorrow?

872
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:50,020
Let me make it up to you
by treating you to dinner.

873
00:59:51,530 --> 00:59:54,000
I have countless meetings tomorrow.

874
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,160
Gosh, it'll be a busy day.

875
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:57,870
Is that so?

876
00:59:59,670 --> 01:00:02,270
I guess it can't be helped, then.

877
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:04,740
We'll take a rain check.

878
01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:07,440
I said I was busy,

879
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:10,180
but I didn't say
I couldn't have dinner with you.

880
01:00:12,310 --> 01:00:14,280
Does this mean
you're no longer upset?

881
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:17,690
I was going to stay angry
until tomorrow,

882
01:00:17,690 --> 01:00:20,920
but hearing your voice
made my anger fade.

883
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:25,190
A man who gives in too easily
isn't very charming.

884
01:00:30,770 --> 01:00:31,800
Thank you.

885
01:00:32,130 --> 01:00:33,500
Going forward,

886
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:37,070
I'll make sure
not to put you on the spot.

887
01:00:38,910 --> 01:00:40,070
I promise.

888
01:00:44,650 --> 01:00:45,650
Oh, dear.

889
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:52,350
I'll go home now, then.

890
01:00:53,490 --> 01:00:55,060
Thank you for bringing me home.

891
01:00:55,620 --> 01:00:56,990
Get back safely.

892
01:00:57,390 --> 01:00:58,530
Who's this?

893
01:00:59,390 --> 01:01:00,430
Honey.

894
01:01:01,630 --> 01:01:04,230
Aren't you the youngest
from Eagle Brewery?

895
01:01:04,530 --> 01:01:05,800
What are you doing here?

896
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:09,300
I was there to handle something,

897
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:11,670
and I suddenly felt dizzy.

898
01:01:11,770 --> 01:01:13,980
I asked him to drive me home.

899
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:18,080
Thank you. You can go now.

900
01:01:18,610 --> 01:01:20,280
Goodbye.

901
01:01:24,150 --> 01:01:27,190
I'd like to ask you something.

902
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:32,090
I want to know
what your previous comment meant.

903
01:01:32,990 --> 01:01:34,060
What comment?

904
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:36,700
When you last came by,

905
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:38,870
you said I wasn't an Oh.

906
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:41,400
It's late. You should go.

907
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:43,670
Go to your room.

908
01:01:43,740 --> 01:01:45,040
What do you think that means?

909
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:47,740
It literally means you're not an Oh.

910
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:48,880
Honey!

911
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:52,850
I'm not an Oh?

912
01:01:54,050 --> 01:01:55,450
What does that mean?

913
01:01:58,020 --> 01:01:59,390
Go home.

914
01:01:59,390 --> 01:02:01,160
Don't mind what he says.

915
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:03,360
- Go...
- You're unrelated to them.

916
01:02:03,460 --> 01:02:05,330
You're a foundling they kept.

917
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:06,930
- You were...
- Honey!

918
01:02:07,830 --> 01:02:10,060
That's enough. Please, stop it.

919
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:11,900
What's wrong with you?

920
01:02:12,130 --> 01:02:13,730
He's over 30 years old.

921
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:16,500
He should know where he came from!

922
01:02:38,930 --> 01:02:40,700
I'll make it clear for you.

923
01:02:41,130 --> 01:02:43,030
It's not a set of five brothers.

924
01:02:43,030 --> 01:02:44,430
It's a set of four.

925
01:02:44,830 --> 01:02:46,730
You're not related to them!

926
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:51,910
(Eagle Brewery)

927
01:02:53,010 --> 01:02:54,680
(Eagle Brewery)

928
01:03:42,890 --> 01:03:45,360
(For Eagle Brothers)

929
01:03:45,590 --> 01:03:48,500
Shouldn't you be grateful
you have parents at all?

930
01:03:48,660 --> 01:03:51,200
Who they are,
and where they are from...

931
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:52,670
Some don't even know that much.

932
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:55,000
Why did you tell Kang Soo
something like that?

933
01:03:55,070 --> 01:03:56,870
Why would you shake up...

934
01:03:56,870 --> 01:03:58,810
a clueless kid
who was doing just fine?

935
01:03:58,910 --> 01:04:01,580
Are you hiding something from me?

936
01:04:01,710 --> 01:04:03,210
Free your schedule tomorrow evening.

937
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:05,380
It's a very special day for us.

938
01:04:05,450 --> 01:04:06,650
"A special day?"

939
01:04:06,650 --> 01:04:07,950
I'll look forward to it.

940
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:11,090
Kwang Sook, you take up...

941
01:04:11,090 --> 01:04:13,190
much more of my mind and effort...

942
01:04:13,190 --> 01:04:14,690
than any business I operate.

943
01:04:14,890 --> 01:04:17,590
That's how much more precious you are.
