00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:04,040
(Episode 35)

2
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,190
I'll make it clear for you.

3
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:23,030
It's not a set of five brothers.
It's a set of four.

4
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:25,130
You're not related to them!

5
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:32,900
Kang Soo.

6
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,040
Why were you standing out here?

7
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,880
Did you get Se Ri's mom home safely?

8
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:42,650
Yes.

9
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,050
Then, why the long face?

10
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,090
Is something up?

11
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,460
No, everything's fine.

12
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:55,030
I bet hosting the birthday party
today wasn't easy.

13
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,130
I'm tired
even though I didn't really do much.

14
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:00,430
We should head inside.

15
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:01,470
Sure.

16
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,910
Have you lost your mind?

17
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:13,710
You're not supposed
to chug strong liquor like this.

18
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:15,550
Who do you think you are?

19
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,720
What gives you the right
to shake up his life...

20
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,920
when he's been living in peace?

21
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:23,220
Who do you think you are?

22
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,860
Have you lost it, woman?

23
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:26,490
How dare you let the alcohol talk
to me like that?

24
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:28,230
For all these years,

25
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:31,800
the family quietly kept
the secret buried.

26
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:35,570
So what gives you the right
to reveal the secret?

27
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:36,940
Darn it!

28
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,440
I'm the one who's curious.

29
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,010
Why are you so sensitive
about Kang Soo's situation?

30
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:42,170
If you're drunk, just sleep it off.

31
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:43,640
I'm not dealing
with your drunken nonsense!

32
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,110
Dokgo Tak, you.

33
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:48,550
You've ruined three people's lives.

34
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:50,450
What?

35
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,880
Se Ri's life,

36
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,290
Kang Soo's life,

37
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,120
and my life.

38
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,530
You've ruined them all.

39
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,190
What on earth are you talking about?

40
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,560
It's over now.

41
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:08,470
It's all over!

42
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,850
Kang Soo...

43
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:34,130
(Eagle Brewery)

44
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,130
(Fermenting Room)

45
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,010
(Eagle Brewery)

46
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,310
Se Ri.

47
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:52,210
What are you doing here?

48
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,480
I was looking at this photo.

49
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,560
I had no idea
my parents worked here.

50
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,490
It's surprising,
and it feels strange.

51
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:14,100
Lieutenant Oh,
do you remember my parents?

52
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:15,930
No.

53
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,800
I was just a baby,
so I have no memory of them.

54
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,640
There's quite an age gap
between me and the rest.

55
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,240
I see.

56
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,350
I just got back
from taking your mother home.

57
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,120
She was so shocked
that she couldn't stand up straight.

58
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,890
She cried all the way in the car.

59
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,490
Despite everything that's happened,

60
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:46,900
she's still the most precious person
in your life.

61
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,130
Don't break your mom's heart.

62
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,310
To me,

63
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:59,540
my parents were perfect role models.

64
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:03,380
But lately,
all they've done is disappoint me.

65
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,050
To tell you the truth, I'm confused.

66
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:12,890
Still, shouldn't you be grateful
you have parents at all?

67
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,330
Who they are,
and where they are from...

68
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,770
Some don't even know that much.

69
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:39,980
What are you two doing in here?

70
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,560
I heard you took
Se Ri's mother home.

71
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,390
I did.

72
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,830
Did anything else happen?

73
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,060
As in what?

74
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:55,370
I was just asking.

75
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,370
I heard you'd be staying
in Kwang Sook's room.

76
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:00,370
Right.

77
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,410
You must all be tired,
so let's go home.

78
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:14,150
Why are you here
when you have your own room?

79
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,620
I'll be sleeping
in Se Ri's room for now.

80
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,160
Are you suggesting we sleep
in separate rooms?

81
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,330
I can't even stand the sound
of your breathing.

82
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:26,230
What did I do
to make you treat me like this?

83
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,670
Why did you tell Kang Soo
something like that?

84
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:33,600
Why would you shake up
a clueless kid...

85
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,510
who was doing just fine?

86
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,780
Kang Soo's not a child anymore.

87
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:40,410
He should know where he came from.

88
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:42,680
You told him for his sake,
is that it?

89
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,250
As if that makes any sense!

90
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,150
Hold on.

91
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,020
Why are you biting my head off
over this?

92
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,030
Isn't it enough
that you're defending that family?

93
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:58,930
Why are you so sensitive
about Kang Soo's situation too?

94
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:00,000
Just why?

95
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:03,770
Are you...

96
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,640
hiding something from me?

97
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,740
What would I hide from you?

98
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:16,850
We know each other inside and out.

99
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:18,980
What could we have to hide?

100
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,890
I lashed out at you...

101
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:24,220
because I was upset with Se Ri.

102
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,730
I think I went too far.

103
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:33,030
Let it go.

104
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:36,870
However upset you are,
we can't sleep in different rooms.

105
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,300
Sleep in the master bedroom.

106
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:49,410
Oh, gosh.

107
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,110
Professor.

108
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:17,340
Hey. You're still up?

109
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,940
I lay down to sleep,

110
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,880
but I woke up when Ha Ni cried.

111
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,010
You heard that.

112
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:25,880
Isn't she old enough
to stop taking formula?

113
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,420
She does eat baby food,

114
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,250
but she still wants a bottle
at night.

115
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,490
I see.

116
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,180
Can I give Ha Ni her bottle?

117
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,220
Will you?

118
00:07:58,780 --> 00:07:59,880
I'll feed her.

119
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,550
I'll clean up and join you.

120
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,620
Okay.

121
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,530
I'm going to feed Ha Ni her formula.

122
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,360
Okay.

123
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:23,370
Kwang Sook.

124
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,380
Beom Soo.

125
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:37,420
You feel...

126
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,760
the same as Se Ri, don't you?

127
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:46,260
That's how it looks to me.

128
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:53,640
I shouldn't want too much...

129
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,170
for Se Ri's sake.

130
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:58,140
And having feelings for her...

131
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,150
makes me feel guilty
because I'm betraying...

132
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,980
my parents, you, and my brothers.

133
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,850
If you were to put all that aside,

134
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,420
can you tell me
exactly and honestly...

135
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,560
how you feel?

136
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,700
Don't think about anything else.

137
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,500
Just consider my feelings.

138
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,580
I don't want to miss out.

139
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,750
I think it might be...

140
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,550
the last chance I ever get
at loving someone.

141
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,920
I don't want to miss out on it.

142
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:49,960
I didn't know I was this selfish.

143
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:53,130
I tell myself I shouldn't do this.

144
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:57,940
But I can't seem to stop.

145
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,340
I'm horrible, aren't I?

146
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:04,880
You shouldn't be criticized...

147
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,310
for your feelings for Se Ri.

148
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:09,850
So...

149
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,180
be proud.

150
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:16,220
Don't think of...

151
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,390
anyone else.

152
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,290
Focus on...

153
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,360
your heart.

154
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,630
Okay?

155
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:34,610
- Yes?
- I'm coming in.

156
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,380
- Hi.
- Hey.

157
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:42,050
Why an emergency meeting
right before bed?

158
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,450
Is something wrong?

159
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,490
How do you all feel...

160
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,990
about Beom Soo...

161
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,390
dating Se Ri?

162
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:02,800
It looks like
they're getting serious.

163
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:05,500
But Beom Soo seems to hesitate...

164
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:08,110
because of the bad blood...

165
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,310
between the two families.

166
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:14,910
It can't be helped
if they love each other.

167
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,480
And Se Ri isn't
like her parents at all.

168
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:21,390
I'm all for it too.

169
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,090
To be honest, other than
that she's Dokgo Tak's daughter,

170
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,920
Beom Soo's really lucky
if he can get her.

171
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,930
She's out of his league.

172
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:30,760
Beom Soo's a catch too.

173
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:32,930
He is.

174
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,970
He's a catch with a kid in tow.

175
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:42,940
Kang Soo, what do you think?

176
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,580
I'll go with what they say.

177
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,950
Then we've decided unanimously...

178
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,190
to back them up, okay?

179
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,520
It's done.

180
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,060
Okay.

181
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:02,560
We've accepted them,
but it won't solve anything.

182
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,360
Se Ri's parents...

183
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,260
will object with all their heart.

184
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:08,670
That jerk Dokgo Tak.

185
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,570
He's so bitter and spiteful.

186
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:13,440
Let's sort things out one by one.

187
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,140
(LX Hotel Chairman Han Dong Seok)

188
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:24,480
The emergency meeting's over.

189
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,650
- Okay.
- Okay.

190
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:26,720
Good night.

191
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:35,430
Hello?

192
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,560
What are you doing?

193
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,500
I'm about to go to bed.

194
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:42,370
Come out to the brewery for a bit.

195
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,200
Right now?

196
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,740
What are you doing here
this late at night?

197
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,680
I have something for you.

198
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:06,690
You left without it
because you were in a hurry.

199
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,190
You could have given it to me
next time.

200
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,130
Did you come here to give me this?

201
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:15,670
Well, that was just an excuse.

202
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,600
I'm actually here
because I was bothered...

203
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,210
that I was angry earlier.

204
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,010
We made up over the phone.

205
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,650
I thought I wouldn't feel better...

206
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:29,210
until we talked face to face.

207
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,980
Don't mind that.

208
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,550
I forgot about it already.

209
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:37,190
I'm not the type to hold a grudge.

210
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,890
I'm on the losing end again.

211
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:45,760
I was too bothered to do anything...

212
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:48,700
after you left the way you did.

213
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:50,570
What?

214
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:52,470
How do you run a business...

215
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,110
when you're that sensitive?

216
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,140
Listen.

217
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,510
I don't worry like this...

218
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,780
when I'm at work.

219
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:04,580
Kwang Sook,

220
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:08,550
you take up
much more of my mind and effort...

221
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,320
than any business I operate.

222
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:14,660
Am I that difficult?

223
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,660
You're not difficult.

224
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:20,100
That's how much more precious
you are.

225
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:45,120
How can you kiss someone
on the cheek so suddenly...

226
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,220
that it's not romantic at all?

227
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:51,830
I had to give you a peck
because you were so sweet.

228
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,100
Do you want one more?

229
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,940
No. Not at all.

230
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:01,210
No, thanks. That's enough for today.

231
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,680
Are you rejecting me?

232
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:10,010
One more peck and my heart
might beat out of my chest.

233
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,020
I'm going home.

234
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,390
Dad's girlfriend?

235
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,560
Yes.

236
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,090
She's a beauty and seems nice.

237
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:00,330
You refused to date Professor Kim.

238
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:01,870
How did you meet this person?

239
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:04,070
Well...

240
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:06,040
I guess it's fate.

241
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:08,740
Please introduce us to her.

242
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:10,610
Okay. I will soon...

243
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:13,410
find time for us to meet up.

244
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,910
Are you thinking of getting married?

245
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:20,150
I'm old enough to consider marriage
when I date someone.

246
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,820
It's not just about dating.

247
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:27,460
Why? Are you upset
that I have a girlfriend?

248
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:29,760
No, it's not like that.

249
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,860
You were jealous of Se Ri.

250
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:35,070
You said you wanted to go shopping,

251
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:37,170
visit good restaurants,
and go on trips with your mom.

252
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,600
I did.

253
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:45,280
By the way, I wonder
if Se Ri went back home.

254
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,710
Did Se Ri leave home?

255
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,180
She had a big fight with her parents
and ran away from home.

256
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:56,920
The man Se Ri likes is a single dad,

257
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:59,520
and her parents are
strongly against it.

258
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,360
A single dad?

259
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,090
A man with a child?

260
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:05,160
Yes.

261
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,560
Apparently,
he's Oh Kang Soo's older brother.

262
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,800
What?

263
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:12,700
Then...

264
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,010
is it Professor Oh Beom Soo?

265
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:18,910
How do you know him?

266
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,410
Well...

267
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,690
Get in the car.

268
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,430
I'm not going to school.

269
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,960
Why not?

270
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:39,030
Actually, I've applied for dropout.

271
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:40,660
What?

272
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:44,740
How could you make such a decision
without consulting me?

273
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:47,440
What? Was I supposed to consult you?

274
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:51,140
Does that mean
you're my guardian now?

275
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,180
No, that's not what I meant.

276
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,380
I'm your professor,
so you should've told me.

277
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,750
My mom forced me
to take the course...

278
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,290
so I could participate...

279
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:06,790
in managing LX Hotel
after marrying Gyeol.

280
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:09,060
I didn't like to do it
in the first place.

281
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:10,760
I'm not cut out for it.

282
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:12,430
I understand, but...

283
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:15,200
how could you decide
such an important thing on your own?

284
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:18,800
You would've tried to stop me
if I'd told you.

285
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,870
So,

286
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,980
what are you going to do now?

287
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:29,510
I'll take some time
and think about it.

288
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,920
You might be late for your class.

289
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,150
Hurry and go.

290
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:38,720
Ha Ni, have fun with Granny.

291
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:42,130
Okay? Bye.

292
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:46,900
I'll talk to you again
after the class.

293
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,370
And you should go back home.

294
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,070
I'll drive you after work.

295
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,440
I'll take care of my own business.

296
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,380
Just go now.

297
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,210
Hurry.

298
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:05,320
Stay here until I come back.

299
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,350
Okay.

300
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:11,790
Se Ri.

301
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:17,130
I thought you went to school
with Beom Soo.

302
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:19,230
I dropped out.

303
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,270
What?

304
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,370
Why did you quit the school
you worked hard to get into?

305
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:28,870
It's enough for me
that I met Professor Oh at school.

306
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:30,840
I don't need my degree.

307
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,180
Still, that doesn't sound right.

308
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:38,980
By the way, you've got some guts.

309
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,090
My nickname is Total Nutcase,

310
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:44,520
but I'm nothing compared to you.

311
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,360
Do you like Beom Soo that much?

312
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:54,160
Yes. I like him a lot.

313
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,840
Listen.

314
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,410
No matter how upset
or angry you are,

315
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,380
you should go back home.

316
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:11,980
You should talk to your parents
and sort things out.

317
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:15,150
They both are stubborn,
so they wouldn't listen to me.

318
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,790
I don't even know
if I can convince my parents.

319
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,060
And...

320
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:27,460
I'm so disappointed in what they did
to Professor Oh's family.

321
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,310
About what my parents did...

322
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:39,280
I'll apologize on their behalf...

323
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,710
and live my life to atone for that.

324
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:43,610
So can you please forgive them?

325
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:01,000
And having feelings for her...

326
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:04,500
makes me feel guilty
because I'm betraying...

327
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:08,310
my parents, you, and my brothers.

328
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,320
(CEO Dokgo Tak)

329
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,350
Come in.

330
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:24,690
CEO Ma Kwang Sook
of Eagle Brewery is here.

331
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:27,120
What did you say?

332
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:29,490
From Eagle Brewery...

333
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,230
Darn it.

334
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:33,130
Let her in.

335
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,700
Please come in.

336
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,240
Hello.

337
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:47,580
If you were...

338
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:49,510
in my shoes,

339
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:52,450
would you be in a mood to say hello?

340
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:56,690
I was so taken aback
that I let you in.

341
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,990
But what made you be so shameless
and visit me here today?

342
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:04,760
I don't think you're here
to throw makgeolli in my face again.

343
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,500
I think it'll be a long story,
so let me sit down first.

344
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,680
You know...

345
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,680
your daughter is staying
at my place, right?

346
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,720
Is my daughter at your place?

347
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:29,850
I guess your wife didn't tell you.

348
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:33,460
Do you not talk to your wife at all?

349
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:34,890
What?

350
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:40,200
I'm here because I want to know
what you're planning to do now.

351
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,970
What do you mean?

352
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:42,970
I want you...

353
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,440
to allow them to date.

354
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:48,340
What nonsense are you talking about?

355
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:52,810
We'll also try to forget
all the bad memories...

356
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,750
about Silla Brewery.

357
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:58,950
So you should approve of them now.

358
00:22:58,950 --> 00:22:59,950
That's enough.

359
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:02,150
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

360
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,150
Get out.

361
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:06,660
Aren't you going to do anything
about your daughter?

362
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:09,430
I've decided to pretend
that I don't have a daughter.

363
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:12,930
Stop being so nosy
and meddling in my family's affairs.

364
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:14,730
and get out this instant!

365
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:19,340
We can't let them break up
because of our past.

366
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:22,370
My goodness.
It's not like you're Beom Soo's mom.

367
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:24,980
You're just his sister-in-law,
and your husband is gone.

368
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:27,240
What right do you have
to meddle like this?

369
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,350
You know what?

370
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,720
I think of Beom Soo
as my younger brother.

371
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,850
I'm here as his older sister.

372
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:39,390
Stop that preposterous nonsense.

373
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:41,860
Listen carefully to me.

374
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:45,060
After going through all that
to raise Se Ri,

375
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:47,900
why would I let her date
a divorced man with a child?

376
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,030
It'd be better to pretend
that I don't have a daughter!

377
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:54,300
If you're being like that,
we also have a lot to say.

378
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,940
You know what we've been through
because of Silla Brewery.

379
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:00,740
But we just can't let our past...

380
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:03,650
get in the way
of the promising young people.

381
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,380
I didn't do all the work
for the good of your family.

382
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:09,050
There's no way I'll approve of them.

383
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,290
So stop being ridiculous
and get out.

384
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,490
It may not be the case
for your tiny brewery,

385
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,330
but I have a lot to prepare
for the upcoming board meeting.

386
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:27,200
Just think carefully about it.

387
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:31,810
It's about the future
of your precious daughter.

388
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,620
That darn woman.

389
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,760
Hello?

390
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,330
Is it true that Se Ri is staying
at Beom Soo's?

391
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:57,470
It is.

392
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,370
You should've dragged her out
of that darn house!

393
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:03,370
How could I,
when she didn't want to leave?

394
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:06,110
You should've broken her legs
if you had to!

395
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:09,610
If you think you have the solution,
then get it done yourself.

396
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:16,790
Hello?

397
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:19,620
Did she just hang up on me again?

398
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,490
Darn it.

399
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,990
What has become of this family?

400
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Shoot.

401
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:32,470
Come in.

402
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,670
Kwang Sook.

403
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:39,680
What brings you to campus?

404
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,650
I wanted to go on a date with you.

405
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:44,680
Have a seat.

406
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,050
I noticed on my way here...

407
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:48,890
that the college
has a beautiful campus.

408
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:53,490
Your office is nice and cozy.

409
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,960
Did you have something to say to me?

410
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,130
I just met with...

411
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,130
Silla Brewery's Dokgo Tak.

412
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:04,770
What?

413
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:06,840
Why did you meet him?

414
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:10,770
The brothers and I had...

415
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:12,480
an emergency meeting last night.

416
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:16,610
We decided
to support your relationship...

417
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:18,350
with Se Ri.

418
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,950
That's why I met with CEO Dokgo Tak.

419
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:23,520
To tell him where we stood.

420
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:25,690
Kwang Sook.

421
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:30,690
Se Ri's feelings for you
are unwavering.

422
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,800
I hope you can accept...

423
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,700
her feelings for you.

424
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:40,100
Within the walls of this campus,

425
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,270
your relationship
as professor and student...

426
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:44,570
might seem like a line
you can't cross.

427
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:48,040
But once you look past that,

428
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,480
it's really no big deal.

429
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,820
Besides, I heard that Se Ri...

430
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,850
dropped out.

431
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:57,750
Also,

432
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,190
Ha Ni played a major role...

433
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,390
in Se Ri falling for you.

434
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:07,600
What you see as a flaw...

435
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,270
isn't really a problem at all.

436
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,200
To be honest,

437
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,610
that's what I came here to say.

438
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:22,150
I understand what you're saying.

439
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:24,910
Thank you, Kwang Sook.

440
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:31,590
How are things going...

441
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:33,960
for your brothers?

442
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:36,660
My daughter told me the youngest
was doing really well...

443
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:38,130
at work.

444
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,460
Well... I'm not sure.

445
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,730
Heung Soo hasn't been doing well
ever since his show business days,

446
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:46,940
and he's been struggling
financially.

447
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:50,010
But he pulled himself together
and opened a toast store.

448
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,570
It's such a relief.

449
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:53,610
I'm glad to hear that.

450
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,080
Anyway,

451
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:59,580
this is something I happened
to hear.

452
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,550
Se Ri...

453
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:05,520
is seeing Professor Oh, right?

454
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:08,490
Hold on. Do you know Se Ri?

455
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:12,630
You see,

456
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:17,270
marriage was being considered
between my son and her.

457
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:19,400
What?

458
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:22,710
The parents selfishly tried
to force it,

459
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,540
but the kids...

460
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:28,510
weren't serious enough
to think about marriage.

461
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:32,150
Right, I see.

462
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,890
I've known her since she was little.

463
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:38,460
Se Ri's a good kid.

464
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:41,160
Yes, it seemed that way.

465
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:44,690
Anyway, shouldn't you...

466
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:47,260
also think about starting over?

467
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:52,400
You and your wife lived apart
for ten years while still married.

468
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,040
I don't see...

469
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,770
how you're any different from me,

470
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:58,410
who's been a widower for 15 years.

471
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,810
You're not getting any younger.

472
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:02,350
You should find happiness
while you can.

473
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:04,780
When you start over,

474
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:06,080
I'll follow suit.

475
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:07,780
What?

476
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:24,200
No way.

477
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,500
Maybe I'm biased because I made it,

478
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:28,510
but it's really good.

479
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,080
Goodness.

480
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:36,310
Hello.

481
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:38,620
I'd like to place a delivery order.
Is that possible?

482
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:41,220
Yes, of course.
How many do you need?

483
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,620
It's an afternoon snack
for the employees,

484
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:45,790
so about 200 servings will do.

485
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:49,430
Did you say 200?

486
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:51,630
Yes, and I'll pay in advance...

487
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,330
to ease your concerns
about a no-show.

488
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,200
Please go ahead.

489
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:00,200
My goodness.

490
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:02,070
Thank you.

491
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:10,010
Are you from LX Hotel?

492
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:11,410
That's right.

493
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:14,480
We'd like 200 sandwiches delivered
twice a week.

494
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,790
Twice a week?

495
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,320
Two hundred sandwiches?

496
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:19,560
That's right.

497
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:27,030
I'm back.

498
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,400
What did the chairman want
to talk to you about?

499
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,140
It was nothing out of the ordinary.

500
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:34,940
He asked how we were handling
the exports to the US...

501
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:36,770
and how the brothers were doing.

502
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,310
I see.

503
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,810
It's Heung Soo.

504
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,750
Hey, Heung Soo. Is something up?

505
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,820
It's huge, Chun Soo.

506
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:49,850
- What's huge?
- LX Hotel...

507
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,660
requested 200 sandwiches
to be delivered...

508
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:54,120
twice a week.

509
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:55,590
LX Hotel?

510
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:57,090
Right.

511
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:00,660
You mustn't disappoint the chairman.

512
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,170
You need to make them with care...

513
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:04,330
and make sure they taste
even better.

514
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:07,070
Your mistakes could put Kwang Sook
in a tough spot.

515
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,070
You get what I mean, right?

516
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:12,310
Right, we'll talk about
the rest later. Sure.

517
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:16,280
Will Heung Soo...

518
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:18,950
be delivering sandwiches
to the hotel?

519
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,250
It seems the chairman
pulled some strings.

520
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:24,690
When he asked about Heung Soo,

521
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:27,190
I mentioned his new store.

522
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:28,830
I see.

523
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:32,260
He's been caring in so many ways.

524
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:35,300
I don't know how we could ever
repay him for all this.

525
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:49,350
Chun Soo.

526
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,950
I have something...

527
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,620
to tell you.

528
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:59,020
Right.

529
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:01,490
Sure.

530
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:06,260
Well,

531
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:11,000
I've been seeing...

532
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,170
Chairman Han.

533
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:30,550
Why aren't you surprised?

534
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,120
I've had...

535
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:36,730
my suspicions.

536
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:41,400
Since when?

537
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:44,630
When Chairman Han and I went out
for drinks,

538
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:48,640
I overheard him talking to you
on the phone.

539
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:50,810
Then,

540
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,040
you've been pretending...

541
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:58,010
not to know anything?

542
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:02,620
I was waiting for you...

543
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:05,990
to tell me yourself.

544
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:11,060
I'm sorry.

545
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:16,730
I shouldn't be betraying...

546
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,570
Jang Soo like this.

547
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:26,610
I tried not to open my heart,

548
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,450
but I couldn't help it.

549
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,790
I don't know how I can face you.

550
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:40,960
What do you mean by that?

551
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:44,430
You're with a man
as decent as the chairman.

552
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:47,230
It's a relief,
and I couldn't be happier.

553
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:50,600
I haven't known him that long,

554
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,500
but I can tell he's a good man.

555
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:56,110
He obviously cares about you.

556
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:59,210
Also,

557
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,450
the Jang Soo I remember...

558
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,120
would give you his blessing.

559
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:18,590
Would...

560
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:22,270
Would he really?

561
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:26,370
Of course. I guarantee that.

562
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:31,370
So don't feel guilty
about this anymore,

563
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,780
and enjoy your time with him.

564
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,850
I'm sure the others
will feel the same way.

565
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:43,290
Thank you.

566
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,560
When will you tell the others?

567
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,160
I think the sooner, the better.

568
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,930
Tell the others?

569
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,230
That's right.

570
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,700
Since you're already at it,
why not today?

571
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,510
Today?

572
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:04,140
Don't go back.

573
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:06,280
It's a one-way street.

574
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:17,350
(Office)

575
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:20,620
(Mr. Go)

576
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:24,090
The receiver is currently busy.

577
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:25,760
Your call will be directed
to voicemail.

578
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,430
Your call may be charged
after the tone.

579
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:30,770
Who talks on the phone
for this long?

580
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:34,300
Hold on. Could he be talking
to his blind date?

581
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,020
Who were you on the phone with?

582
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,420
I kept calling
but couldn't reach you!

583
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:50,750
My gosh!

584
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,360
Why are you yelling at me?

585
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:57,430
It's not like I need permission
to be on the phone.

586
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,000
Were you...

587
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:01,000
talking to your blind date?

588
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:05,500
I must be right,
seeing you won't answer.

589
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:07,140
Was that the case?

590
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,470
I won't answer. I plead the Fifth.

591
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:12,380
You won't answer me,
which means I guessed right.

592
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:13,410
Right?

593
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:15,510
Think whatever you want.
I plead the Fifth.

594
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:18,050
Are you really going
to be this difficult?

595
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:20,780
If you have nothing to say,
I'll hang up.

596
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:24,320
But...

597
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:31,190
Her and her temper!

598
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,670
Can she get any cuter?

599
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:39,100
I guess you like your date a lot.

600
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,300
Come on. We went on only one date,
so it's too soon to tell.

601
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,070
I should see her a few more times.

602
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:44,610
I'll get going, then.

603
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,490
Are you happy about something?

604
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:01,360
It's nothing your young soul
should know about.

605
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:12,500
(Be back soon)

606
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,570
(Be back soon)

607
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,910
Where did she go
after closing up her salon again?

608
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:29,990
Hey, Heung Soo.

609
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,220
Where are you?

610
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:34,160
I came to the vet to see Gureum.

611
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:38,560
You went to that place again?

612
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:42,470
The one interested
in adopting Gureum...

613
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:46,000
would like
to take it home next week.

614
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,300
What should I say?

615
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:50,570
Is this person trustworthy?

616
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:52,210
Of course.

617
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:54,310
They know how to care for dogs...

618
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:56,980
and have experience with dogs
that need special care.

619
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,180
Then,

620
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:04,390
I won't get to see Gureum again.

621
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,820
What a bummer.

622
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:22,740
Heung Soo?

623
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:24,070
Hello.

624
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:25,270
We should talk.

625
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:27,210
Maybe later.

626
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,950
I want to hang back and play
with Gureum a little longer.

627
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:32,550
Are you kidding me? Come with me.

628
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:39,690
What is this?

629
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:41,560
Get out of my way.

630
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,560
You can't drag her out...

631
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,760
when she clearly said
she'd talk to you later.

632
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:47,930
Hold on. I'll be right back.

633
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,280
Who does he think he is?

634
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,520
That hurts.

635
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,250
Let go if you want to talk.

636
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,620
Give it to me straight.

637
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:15,290
About what?

638
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:17,160
What's going on
between you and that vet?

639
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:20,130
Is something going on
between you two?

640
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:23,070
- What?
- If not,

641
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,630
why are you spending time with him
whenever you can?

642
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:28,500
That's only because of Gureum.

643
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:30,370
Gureum this and Gureum that!

644
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:32,210
Stop using the dog as an excuse!

645
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:35,710
So what if something's going on
between me and him?

646
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:37,550
What's it to you?

647
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:39,480
What?

648
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,120
There's nothing between us.

649
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:45,320
You said I shouldn't tie you down
after just one night together.

650
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:48,260
Well, that's...

651
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,690
Whether I'm just testing the waters
or diving in,

652
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:52,960
that's none of your business.

653
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,500
What was that?

654
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:01,840
Is there something going on
between them or not?

655
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:04,670
Darn it.

656
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,860
And you should go back home.

657
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,690
I'll drive you after work.

658
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:27,330
Stay here until I come back.

659
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:28,400
Got it?

660
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:36,240
Wait. Se Ri?

661
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:38,140
Goodness.

662
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:39,710
Hello.

663
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:41,880
Are you going somewhere?

664
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:45,780
I'm not sure.

665
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,520
I don't know where I should go.

666
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:54,090
Come on in for a cold drink.

667
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,090
Thank you.

668
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,860
(Hiring part-time staff)

669
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:00,930
Wait.

670
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:04,030
Are you looking
to hire a part-timer?

671
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:16,680
Hello?

672
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,750
Hey, I just wrapped up
my lectures...

673
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:20,180
and will head out in five minutes.

674
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:22,720
I'll drive you home, so wait for me.

675
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:24,050
Actually,

676
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:26,160
I just got a job.

677
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,060
You got a job?

678
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:31,390
What do you mean by that?

679
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,100
Let me talk to him.

680
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:44,170
It's me, Beom Soo.

681
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:48,080
Se Ri doesn't want to go home.

682
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:50,780
But she didn't have
anywhere else to go,

683
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:52,850
so I told her she could stay
with me.

684
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:54,950
I hope it's okay.

685
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:58,590
I didn't mean to trouble you too.

686
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:00,120
I'm sorry.

687
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:11,400
I was hoping to see you,

688
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:14,300
but I came down with something
and couldn't call.

689
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:17,810
Forget everything
my husband said last night.

690
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:19,910
It's all a lie.

691
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:23,810
I'm not an Oh? What does that mean?

692
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:25,810
Don't mind what he says.

693
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:28,080
- Go...
- You're unrelated to them.

694
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,090
You're a foundling they kept.

695
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:31,650
- You were...
- Honey!

696
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:42,800
Hello?

697
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:46,270
This is Oh Kang Soo.

698
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:48,900
Are you feeling very sick?

699
00:42:58,550 --> 00:42:59,620
Kang Soo?

700
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,420
You sounded awful,

701
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:06,720
but you said
you hadn't taken any medicine.

702
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:13,730
Goodness me.

703
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:16,270
Thank you.

704
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,870
Did you come all the way here
just to give me this?

705
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,300
I also wanted to ask you something.

706
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:26,610
Like I texted you,

707
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,850
don't pay attention
to what my husband said.

708
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:33,220
That's a ridiculous lie.

709
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:34,780
I know that it isn't a lie.

710
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:40,590
So, please tell me what you know.

711
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:47,460
Am I not my parents' biological son?

712
00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:17,960
Don't stop. Drive on.

713
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:26,600
Then...

714
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:29,770
I was abandoned outside the brewery?

715
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:32,610
Don't say that.

716
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:34,340
You weren't abandoned.

717
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:41,180
You were clean and bathed.

718
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:43,490
I heard you were wrapped...

719
00:44:43,490 --> 00:44:45,620
in a new blanket very carefully.

720
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:47,390
The former CEO Mr. Oh said...

721
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:50,330
the family must've had
a reason to do this.

722
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,500
"Someone
might come looking for him,"

723
00:44:53,930 --> 00:44:56,870
"so keep everything
including the swaddling clothes."

724
00:44:57,470 --> 00:44:59,670
That's what I heard he said.

725
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:02,840
Mr. Oh and his wife...

726
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:05,370
were pleased to be blessed
with another precious life.

727
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:09,650
Your older brothers
refused to put you down.

728
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:13,150
They looked after you
and cherished you.

729
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:15,920
You were loved...

730
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,220
more than anyone.

731
00:45:20,990 --> 00:45:22,020
Did you...

732
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:25,960
see me yourself when I was left...

733
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:28,030
outside the brewery?

734
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,200
No.

735
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:35,540
I started working there
shortly afterward.

736
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:38,040
I didn't see that in person.

737
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,480
I only heard about it.

738
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:45,850
I see.

739
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,820
Go on living...

740
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:59,160
as happily as you did so far.

741
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:02,130
Nothing will change.

742
00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:06,400
Yes, of course. You're right.

743
00:46:07,770 --> 00:46:09,370
Nothing will change.

744
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,410
Thank you for sharing.

745
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:19,280
Kang Soo.

746
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:27,020
I'm sure that you were loved
when you were born,

747
00:46:28,090 --> 00:46:29,390
and that your birth mother...

748
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,830
prayed a lot for you.

749
00:46:32,730 --> 00:46:33,830
So...

750
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,530
don't ever be upset or feel hurt.

751
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:39,670
Okay?

752
00:47:58,810 --> 00:48:00,080
- Do you need a bag?
- Please.

753
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:01,320
Sure.

754
00:48:03,850 --> 00:48:04,990
Six dollars, please.

755
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:06,860
Insert your card into the reader.

756
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:09,860
You paid six dollars.

757
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:11,330
- You can get your card.
- Okay.

758
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:13,960
Shall I heat it for you?

759
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:15,260
No, thanks.

760
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:16,400
Okay.

761
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:19,230
- Goodbye.
- Thank you.

762
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:24,540
Hi, Professor.

763
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:29,510
Ha Ni.

764
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:31,610
You're here too?

765
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:34,850
You really won't go home?

766
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:38,350
I got a job. I should work hard.

767
00:48:38,590 --> 00:48:39,620
Se Ri.

768
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,190
Don't worry.

769
00:48:41,190 --> 00:48:42,760
I'm confident I can do this.

770
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:48,500
I decided to stay with Mi Sun
for a while.

771
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:50,530
What?

772
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:53,500
I found a place to stay
and a job too.

773
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:56,770
I'd say the perks are pretty great
for my first ever job.

774
00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:01,680
How can you smile
in these circumstances?

775
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:03,150
What's wrong?

776
00:49:03,350 --> 00:49:04,650
I love it...

777
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:07,150
that I get to see Ha Ni
and you often.

778
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:12,850
I know, Ha Ni.

779
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:20,060
I didn't think...

780
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:22,200
Vice-CEO Oh would've noticed.

781
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:26,100
A perfect crime
isn't easy to commit.

782
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:28,240
It isn't.

783
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:31,170
It's for the better.

784
00:49:31,770 --> 00:49:34,140
Let's come clean to your family...

785
00:49:34,310 --> 00:49:36,140
and stop dating in secret.

786
00:49:37,410 --> 00:49:39,650
We're not teenagers sneaking around.

787
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:42,380
It was such an inconvenience.

788
00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:47,960
What's wrong? Are you worried?

789
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,860
My other brothers-in-law...

790
00:49:51,830 --> 00:49:53,530
I hope they don't feel hurt.

791
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:56,700
They're grown adults.

792
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:58,530
Don't worry for nothing.

793
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:03,370
My kids...

794
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:06,540
are badgering me
to introduce you to them.

795
00:50:07,010 --> 00:50:09,610
I'd like to arrange that soon.
Are you okay with it?

796
00:50:11,850 --> 00:50:13,950
Yes. Let's do that.

797
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:18,320
It won't be too uncomfortable.

798
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:19,990
Both of them hoped...

799
00:50:19,990 --> 00:50:22,390
I'd meet someone nice and remarry.

800
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:27,460
What if they say they don't like me?

801
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:32,330
Then...

802
00:50:34,270 --> 00:50:35,500
we must break up.

803
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:38,540
What?

804
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:42,410
Not us. Me and my kids.

805
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:45,550
Their dad wants to date again
after years.

806
00:50:45,550 --> 00:50:47,220
I'll kick them out
if they ruin things.

807
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:50,650
What?

808
00:50:51,290 --> 00:50:54,160
You are my priority, Kwang Sook.

809
00:50:54,790 --> 00:50:56,020
My kids come second.

810
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:00,100
Let's eat.

811
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:06,870
(Eagle Brewery)

812
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:08,870
We're here already.

813
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:15,280
Drive back safely.

814
00:51:16,950 --> 00:51:17,980
Kwang Sook.

815
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:21,850
Let's set...

816
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:24,720
a D-Day.

817
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:28,920
A D-Day for what?

818
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:33,630
For our wedding.

819
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:38,530
We just started seeing each other.

820
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:41,600
You want to set that date already?

821
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:43,000
We don't have...

822
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:45,070
too much time.

823
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:49,040
Spending a year or two dating
before marriage like youngsters...

824
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:50,910
is a waste of our time.

825
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:55,550
How long?

826
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:58,520
What do you mean?

827
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:00,560
How long do you need...

828
00:52:00,990 --> 00:52:02,660
to decide you're ready to marry?

829
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:05,230
A month?

830
00:52:05,230 --> 00:52:06,360
Twenty days?

831
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:08,860
Or ten days like last time?

832
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:11,670
No.

833
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:14,400
Don't even mention D-Day.

834
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:16,510
You don't know how stressed out...

835
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:19,640
I was about that thing last time.

836
00:52:21,910 --> 00:52:24,950
Even so, that D-Day
was what made it possible...

837
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:27,750
for us to get closer.

838
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:35,460
I have something...

839
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:38,790
more pressing than that D-Day.

840
00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:44,900
Today,

841
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:47,500
I'm going to...

842
00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:54,280
tell my brothers-in-law
about you and me.

843
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:02,850
Shall I come in with you?

844
00:53:04,450 --> 00:53:05,590
No.

845
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:07,290
This is something...

846
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:10,860
I must do on my own.

847
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:23,740
Good luck.

848
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:29,010
Good luck to me.

849
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:42,020
I'm here to give you
a sales report, Ms. Investor.

850
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:45,160
Take a seat.

851
00:54:11,850 --> 00:54:12,920
Unbelievable!

852
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:17,630
Why are the sales so big?

853
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:20,800
I got a bulk order.

854
00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:23,100
A bulk order?

855
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:25,270
LX Hotel says
they'll order 200 toasts...

856
00:54:25,270 --> 00:54:28,240
twice a week for employee snacks.

857
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:30,540
LX Hotel?

858
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:33,340
I have so many connections,
you know.

859
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:35,540
So it just happened that way.

860
00:54:35,610 --> 00:54:36,610
My goodness.

861
00:54:37,350 --> 00:54:40,380
I didn't know
you were a capable man.

862
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:45,220
We're going to make a fortune
at this rate.

863
00:54:46,790 --> 00:54:48,060
I'll make a fortune...

864
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:50,090
so you'll roll in wealth, Ok Bun.

865
00:54:50,090 --> 00:54:51,130
Look forward to it.

866
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:54,860
Hang on.

867
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:55,860
Sure.

868
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:04,510
Gureum had a lot of fun
playing with the dolls today.

869
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:06,040
Gureum!

870
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:07,910
Gureum enjoyed good food too.

871
00:55:07,910 --> 00:55:09,340
- Hi.
- Right?

872
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:11,010
- What are you doing?
- You startled me.

873
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:14,920
Why are you yelling at me?

874
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:17,350
What are you doing
in the middle of the sales report?

875
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:22,090
Well... Doctor Baek sent me
a video of Gureum,

876
00:55:22,090 --> 00:55:23,790
so I'm watching it.

877
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:26,960
Where are you going?

878
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,370
What's wrong with him?

879
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:37,710
(Vet)

880
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:40,040
Excuse me!

881
00:55:52,650 --> 00:55:54,090
How may I help you?

882
00:55:55,990 --> 00:55:58,890
Be a man
and give me an honest answer.

883
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,530
Do you...

884
00:56:02,530 --> 00:56:03,670
like Ok Bun?

885
00:56:04,430 --> 00:56:05,430
Pardon?

886
00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:07,300
You know Ok Bun is tenderhearted.

887
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:09,040
So you're using a stray dog...

888
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,910
to arouse her sympathy...

889
00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:12,770
and hit on her now.

890
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:19,350
Answer honestly as a man.

891
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:22,180
Say that you like her if you do.

892
00:56:23,890 --> 00:56:24,890
Well...

893
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:27,790
What is your relationship
with Ms. Ji...

894
00:56:27,790 --> 00:56:29,260
to ask me such a thing?

895
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:34,400
I'm her close friend.

896
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:37,870
A close friend?

897
00:56:37,870 --> 00:56:40,670
Yes. We are very close.

898
00:56:40,670 --> 00:56:42,970
That's all the more reason
not to answer the question.

899
00:56:42,970 --> 00:56:44,870
You're not her boyfriend.

900
00:56:44,870 --> 00:56:47,440
I have no reason to talk about it...

901
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:49,610
to her close friend.

902
00:56:50,850 --> 00:56:52,050
Are you refusing to answer...

903
00:56:52,810 --> 00:56:54,620
because it's true?

904
00:56:55,450 --> 00:56:56,450
Well...

905
00:56:58,050 --> 00:57:00,760
You can say it however you like.

906
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:06,660
So that's what it is.

907
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:09,230
He's using the dog
to hit on Ok Bun now.

908
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:14,170
(Vet)

909
00:57:14,170 --> 00:57:15,300
What do I do now?

910
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:19,170
A vet is really hard to deal with.

911
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:42,660
Go on living...

912
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:45,930
as happily as you did so far.

913
00:57:46,170 --> 00:57:48,200
Nothing will change.

914
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:49,270
That's right.

915
00:57:51,170 --> 00:57:52,840
Nothing will change.

916
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:08,590
(Court)

917
00:58:10,630 --> 00:58:12,260
(I want to be with you
every day, every moment.)

918
00:58:12,730 --> 00:58:14,360
Free your schedule tomorrow evening.

919
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:18,800
Why? What day is it?

920
00:58:19,230 --> 00:58:21,100
It's a very special day for us.

921
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:23,000
A special day?

922
00:58:24,110 --> 00:58:25,110
Hang on.

923
00:58:26,010 --> 00:58:27,810
It's not your birthday.

924
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:29,810
And it's not my birthday either.

925
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:32,610
What is it?

926
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:34,750
I'll tell you tomorrow.

927
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:36,990
Okay.

928
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:39,550
I don't know what it is about,

929
00:58:39,950 --> 00:58:41,320
but I'll look forward to it.

930
00:58:43,630 --> 00:58:44,860
I look forward to it too.

931
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:48,130
Good night.

932
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:06,980
Come in.

933
00:59:10,550 --> 00:59:13,390
Do you have some time?

934
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:15,260
Sure.

935
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:17,630
I'll tell the guys to gather.

936
00:59:44,350 --> 00:59:45,890
Are we having
another emergency meeting?

937
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:47,290
What is it about today?

938
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:48,790
Well...

939
00:59:54,130 --> 00:59:56,260
Kwang Sook has something to say.

940
00:59:56,930 --> 00:59:58,370
What is it?

941
01:00:02,270 --> 01:00:04,040
I'm sleepy,
so let's get this over with.

942
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:08,310
Why? Did something happen
at the brewery?

943
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:12,580
No. It's not that.

944
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:13,680
What is it then?

945
01:00:30,430 --> 01:00:31,670
Hang on a second.

946
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:33,200
All right.

947
01:00:52,490 --> 01:00:53,650
The thing is...

948
01:00:59,630 --> 01:01:02,500
Here's what happened.

949
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:15,840
Well...

950
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:18,350
What...

951
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:20,950
I'm trying to say is...

952
01:01:22,550 --> 01:01:23,650
This is killing me.

953
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:26,720
Excuse me.

954
01:01:29,490 --> 01:01:30,590
Is someone here?

955
01:01:30,730 --> 01:01:31,760
Honey.

956
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:36,500
- "Honey?"
- Chun Soo.

957
01:01:36,930 --> 01:01:38,170
"Chun Soo?"

958
01:02:01,420 --> 01:02:02,460
Honey.

959
01:02:03,590 --> 01:02:04,830
I'm here.

960
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:17,610
So Yeon.

961
01:02:21,310 --> 01:02:22,440
What are you doing here?

962
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:41,660
What are you doing?

963
01:02:43,870 --> 01:02:45,330
I'm sorry, honey.

964
01:02:47,270 --> 01:02:48,440
Please forgive me.

965
01:02:51,270 --> 01:02:52,270
What?

966
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:45,060
(For Eagle Brothers)

967
01:03:45,290 --> 01:03:46,290
Kwang Sook.

968
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:48,300
I'm ashamed to face you.

969
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:49,300
"Kwang Sook?"

970
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:50,770
Let go of it!

971
01:03:50,770 --> 01:03:51,800
- No!
- Get out!

972
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:53,230
- Let go!
- Stop!

973
01:03:53,430 --> 01:03:55,900
You might end up behind bars
like last time.

974
01:03:56,140 --> 01:03:57,270
You should stop it, Kwang Sook.

975
01:03:57,270 --> 01:03:58,770
I must say...

976
01:03:58,770 --> 01:04:02,140
that the Oh brothers are
as clueless as ever.

977
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:05,010
I never imagined you didn't know...

978
01:04:05,010 --> 01:04:06,310
that you were adopted.

979
01:04:06,650 --> 01:04:08,420
Now that you're old enough
to consider marriage,

980
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:10,750
you should know about your roots.

981
01:04:10,950 --> 01:04:13,390
Do you know anything about it?
